INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - DAY
From far above it looks like a great clockwork

We are looking down on the Grand Hall of the Paris Train
Station

It is crowded

People bustle back and forth

Like the gears and wheels of a clock

A precise beautiful machine

We float down

Under the great iron girders

Moving through the station

Past kiosks and shops

Weaving among commuters

We stop at a clock set into the station wall
Behind the ironwork dial we see a face peering out

HUGO CABRET looks at us He is a serious-looking boy of
around 12 Long hair

It is 1931

INT TRAIN STATION -- TUNNELS - DAY

Hugo turns away from the dial and moves through the tunnels
behind the clock

A serpentine maze of passageways

Behind the walls

Hugo’s secret world

He moves quickly up and down spiral staircases ducking
through tiny openings swerving in and out of dark
passages up and down back and forth

Like an elaborate game of Chutes and Ladders

He finally stops Peers through another clock dial into a
different part of the station
He sees
A TOY BOOTH

Bedraggled and struggling A counter filled with windup toys
dolls and little games

GEORGES a grim old man with a white goatee sits at the
counter of the booth

Hugo watches

ISABELLE appears from inside the booth and talks to the old
man She has a book under her arm

She is a lively imaginative girl about Hugo’s age She has
a charming Louise Brooks haircut

Isabelle argues a bit with Georges He snaps at her Upset
she hurries off

Hugo watches her go

Then he turns his gaze to the toys on the counter

He sees the old man aimlessly wind a TOY MOUSE It skitters
across the counter The old man crosses his arms Falls
asleep

Hugo stares at the toy mouse

Then he moves

He skitters through a series of passages and opens an air
vent He carefully climbs out into the station

INT TRAIN STATION -- TOY BOOTH - DAY

Hugo creeps to the Toy Booth

The toy mouse is there on the counter

Georges still appears to be asleep

Hugo stops

Waits

Looks around

Carefully reaches for the toy mouse--

But-—-
Georges’ eyes snap open--

He grabs Hugo--

Hugo drops the toy mouse--

It falls and breaks--

Hugo struggles Georges holds him firm

GEORGES

Got you at last my little thief
Quick empty your pockets

HUGO
You’re hurting me

GEORGES
Empty your pockets or I’1l call the
Station Inspector Do as I say
The threat of the Station Inspector terrifies Hugo
He quickly empties his pockets Dozens of objects Screws
Nails Bits of metal and glass Tiny pieces of clockworks

Cogs and wheels

GEORGES
And the other one

HUGO
There’s nothing in it

GEORGES
(Starts to call)
Where’s the Station Inspector

Hugo empties his last pocket Reluctantly giving up a
precious object

An old cardboard NOTEBOOK
Georges flips through it--

He sees words pictures engineering diagrams schematics
clockwork drawings--

Then he suddenly stops flipping--
Shocked--
It is like he has seen a ghost--

He stares at a page of the notebook--

A drawing of a MECHANICAL MAN man with clockwork innards An
elegant and complex mechanism

But it is the face of the mechanical man that transfixes
Strangely passive and yet expressing a sort of sadness Or
wisdom

It is a haunting face
Georges thumbs through a few pages of the notebook
It is like an old FLIPBOOK

The mechanical man’s face changes perspective as the pages
flip past Like primitive animation

Georges stops
Slowly closes the notebook
GEORGES
(whispers )
Ghosts
He turns to Hugo Sadness turning to rage
GEORGES
Did you draw these pictures
(no response)
Did you draw these pictures
Hugo tries to pull away

Georges’ grip is iron

GEORGES
Where did you steal this

HUGO
I didn’t steal it

GEORGES
A thief and a liar

Georges releases Hugo

GEORGES
Get out of my sight

HUGO
Give me my notebook
GEORGES
It is no longer your notebook it
is my notebook and I’11 do with it
what I want Maybe I’11 just burn
it

HUGO
No

GEORGES
Then tell me who did the drawings

Hugo glares at him Says nothing

Georges suddenly SLAMS his fist down on the counter All the
toys jump

GEORGES
GET OUT OF HERE YOU LITTLE THIEF

His shout echoes around the station

Reverberating from walls ceiling girders windows
all around the cavernous station

To the ears of
MAXIMILIAN -- an enormous Doberman Pinscher

His ears perk up His head tilts dangerously He glares
Listening Alert

THE STATION INSPECTOR his master glances down at him
The Station Inspector is a tall man in a bottle-green coat
flamboyantly frightening Made even more menacing by a
squeaking metal brace that bolts around one leg He’s like a
partly mechanical man
He and Maximilian are twin figures of implacable severity
STATION INSPECTOR

Maximilian What do you hear

-- Do you hear malfeasance
The dog growls dangerously
Strains at his leash

The Station Inspector smiles

STATION INSPECTOR
Go
He releases the terrible hound--
Maximilian bolts--

The Station Inspector follows -- he is remarkably agile with
his iron-shrouded leg moving like an elegant spider--

Maximilian tears through the station--

People leap aside in shock and terror as the ferocious dog
sweeps past-—-

The Station Inspector spiders after him his boots pounding
over the polished floors his leg brace squeaking wildly--

Maximilian’s nails slips as he rounds a corner he almost
spins out but doesn’t--

For ahead he sees--

Hugo

At the toy booth

Hugo sees the dog and sprints--
Running away in desperation--

Maximilian pursues--

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - DAY
The chase is on

Huge weaves through pedestrians -- whips around corners --
races down and up stairs -- leaping over luggage--

Maximilian on his heels--

The Station Inspector follows relentlessly--

Insane whirlwind momentum as the station zips past--

Hugo pants for air glancing back in panic--

Maximilian is closer and closer--

The Station Inspector spiders after them -- his leg brace
screeching -- his green coat flaring out behind him like
bat’s wings--

Hugo speeds through a CAFE agilely weaving between the
little tables and the sniffy French waiters--

Maximilian follows not quite so agilely upsetting tables
and waiters--
Chaos--

MADAME EMILIE the shy older woman who runs the cafe screams
and clutches her beloved little DACHSHUND to her chest--

The dachshund barks furiously at Maximilian--

Hugo loops around a table--

Where a man who looks suspiciously like James Joyce is having
a demitasse with a man who looks suspiciously like Salvador

Dali--

They are agog as Hugo races around them followed by
Maximilian followed by the Station Inspector--

Hugo finally sprints away from the cafe
Tearing through the crowded terminal again
The Station Inspector calls after him

STATION INSPECTOR
STOP THAT CHILD -- APPREHEND

MONSIEUR FRICK the shy older gentleman who runs a NEWSPAPER
KIOSK across from the cafe makes a half-hearted grab for
Hugo--

But Hugo suddenly--

Dives--

Sliding on the polished floor between Monsieur Frick’s legs--
Then he’s up and gone--

Monsieur Frick looks up alarmed leaps to the side as--

Maximilian thunders past--

The Station Inspector follows -- by now Hugo has disappeared
around a corner--

The Station Inspector and Maximilian rip around the corner at
top speed--
INT TRAIN STATION -- CORRIDOR -- DAY

But Hugo is gone--

And ahead -- a MATRONLY WOMAN and her two UNIFORMED VALETS
carrying towers of boxes from the most exclusive stores in
Paris--

The Station Inspector and Maximilian try to stop -- but can’t
-- momentum too great -- collision inevitable--

BAM

Boxes flying everywhere -- Valets knocked aside -- Matronly
Woman bellowing like Margaret Dumont -- the Station Inspector

and Maximilian tangled

We move away from the chaos

Toward a wall

To find Hugo Safe behind an air vent Watching

He sees the Station Inspector pull himself up Squeak his leg
brace once in anger Thwarted

INT TRAIN STATION -- TUNNELS - DAY

Hugo weaves through the tunnels

Comes to an iron door and enters

INT TRAIN STATION -- SECRET APARTMENT - DAY

It is like stepping into the heart of a mechanical toy
Wheels and gears hang everywhere There are rows of jars
filled with cogs screws and bits of toys Tools Scavenged
furniture

Hugo’s home and makeshift workshop

He sits on a battered old trunk for a moment Disheartened
He pulls out a large POCKET WATCH Looks at it

Takes a deep breath

Time to go to work

He picks up a bucket of heavy tools and goes

INT TRAIN STATION -- TUNNELS - DAY

Huge moves through the tunnels

Stops behind a large clock He can see the station through
the clock face He checks the time on his pocket watch

Then he uses tools from the bucket to wind the clock’s
mechanism

Then he continues on

Opens a hatch and climbs down a rickety ladder

INT TRAIN STATION -- HANGING CLOCK - DAY

He climbs down into a large clock that is suspended from the
ceiling of the Grand Hall Clock dials and intricate works
surround him on all four sides

While he winds all four clockworks he looks out into the
station below

He sees Madame Emilie the shy older woman who runs the cafe
cooing to her little dachshund

He sees Monsieur Frick the shy older gentleman who runs the
newspaper kiosk watching her

Monsieur Frick summons up his nerve Timidly approaches her
Bows rather formally She is delighted He tries to pet the
dachshund The dog snaps at him Madame Emilie is mortified
Monsieur Frick retreats

Hugo climbs up out of the clock

INT TRAIN STATION -- TUNNELS - DAY

Hugo continues on

Climbs a ladder to a narrow passage that overlooks a
platform

INT TRAIN STATION -- PLATFORM CLOCK - DAY

Hugo moves along a narrow passage above a station platform
He must kneel to wind this clock which is at his foot level
Through the clock he sees

MONSIEUR ROULEAU is a flamboyant young artist He is painting
at an easel He is a Surrealist

His painting is wildly abstract

Some SUBURBAN COMMUTERS stop to look They ridicule the
painting Monsieur Rouleau tries to ignore them
Hugo feels bad for him

Hugo completes winding the clock and goes

INT TRAIN STATION -- TOWER STAIRS - DAY

Hugo climbs and climbs and climbs His bucket of tools is
heavy

An endless staircase inside a high tower

INT TRAIN STATION -- CLOCK TOWER - DAY

Hugo emerges at the very top of the station

An enormous clock The motors and gears of the mechanism are
huge bigger than he is Hugo puts a crank into the works and
uses all his strength to turn it

It is like something out of METROPOLIS

And beyond the clock

Paris

A panoramic view

Somewhat unreal

Like an exquisite toy model

Exhausted Hugo finally completes winding the clock

He takes a moment to look over the majestic city

And we fade to

INT TRAIN STATION -- TOY BOOTH - EVENING
The Grand Hall is almost empty

Georges in his hat and coat is closing up the shop Pulling
down a heavy grate

Hugo stands silently behind him

GEORGES
(not turning)
I know you’re there What’s your
name boy
HUGO
Hugo Hugo Cabret
GEORGES

Stay away from me Hugo Cabret or
I‘ll drag you to the Station
Inspector’s office and he’1ll lock
you up in his little cell and
youll never get out and you’1ll
never go to school and you’ll never
get married and have children of
your own to take things that don’t
belong to them

Georges completes locking the gate and goes
Hugo follows
They walk through the echoing station

HUGO
Give me back my notebook

GEORGES

I am going home to burn your

notebook
Georges sweeps through the doors leaving the station
Hugo stops at the doors hesitates for a moment
He is extremely uncomfortable at the idea of leaving the
station It has become his whole world Everything beyond is
threatening
But his need now is great He steels himself takes a breath
and pushes through the doors following Georges
EXT STREETS - EVENING
Georges walks through the dark streets of Paris
Hugo follows
It is the spirit of the great city we see not the real

thing Shapes and silhouettes of buildings Architectural
details Sounds Illusion

Like a lovingly crafted 1930s movie set

HUGO
You can’t burn my notebook

GEORGES
And who’s to stop me

Hugo wasn’t prepared for leaving the station It’s cold He
has no winter coat He pulls his clothes tightly around him

Later

Georges walks on

Hugo follows A little closer

Later

Georges walks under a street lamp

Hugo follows A little closer still
Later

Georges walks over a bridge

Hugo follows A little closer still
Later

Georges moves through a sinister alley
Hugo scared is walking right next to him now
Georges ignores him

Snow begins to fall

EXT GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
Georges and Hugo walk through a graveyard

Twisted trees The shape of tombstones Like Lean’s GREAT
EXPECTATIONS

Snow continues to fall

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Georges walks to a decrepit apartment building Right across
from the graveyard Shabby part of town

The old man stops and unlocks the chipped front door with a
large key
Hugo waits

Georges enters the building and without a glance slams the
door shut behind him

Hugo stands there

Snow falls

Hugo steps back studies the building

He sees Georges enter an upper floor apartment Sees a
handsome older woman -- his wife -- greet him They disappear

from view

Huge scans the other windows He sees Isabelle the girl from
the Toy Booth in another room of the apartment

She is reading by the window
Hugo watches her

Snow collects on his head

He finally tosses a pebble up at the window Isabelle looks
down Sees him

She stares at him quizzically

He motions for her to come down

She is intrigued but unsure

He motions Begs Please

Isabelle smiles

She loves nothing more than an adventure

She disappears from the window

EXT GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
Hugo stands shivering
Isabelle runs to him

ISABELLE
Who are you
HUGO
Your grandfather stole my notebook
I need to get it back before he
burns it

ISABELLE
Papa Georges isn’t my grandfather
and he isn’t a thief He told me
all about you young gentleman
You’re nothing but aa

reprobate

She is delighted with the word He doesn’t understand

HUGO
Can you help me get inside
ISABELLE
No You have to go
HUGO
Not without my notebook--
ISABELLE
Why do you need it so badly
HUGO
(hesitates)
I I can’t tell you
ISABELLE
Is it a secret
HUGO
Yes
ISABELLE
Good I love secrets Tell me this
instant
HUGO
No
ISABELLE
If you won’t tell me you have to
go
HUGO

Not without--

ISABELLE
I’1ll get in trouble Just go home

He won’t budge

ISABELLE
All right I’1l make sure he
doesn’t burn your notebook
He looks at her

ISABELLE
Trust me

He looks at her

He nods

He runs off

She watches him go
What a strange boy

She smiles

INT TRAIN STATION -- SECRET APARTMENT - NIGHT
Hugo enters Still cold

He strikes a match Lights a few candles

A golden glow fills the strange chamber

Hugo takes out his pocket watch and hangs it on a special
hook by the bed

Then he moves to a corner

There is something covered in an old sheet

He pulls off the sheet to reveal

The AUTOMATON

An amazing mechanical man A couple feet tall Exposed gears
and levers Clockworks and springs In a state of disrepair
We recognize the strange haunting face from the drawings in

Hugo’s notebook

The Automaton sits at a little desk Pen poised to write
something

Hugo stares at the passive face of the Automaton

And remembers

HUGO (VO)
What is it

HUGOS FATHER (VO)
It’s called an Automaton

The color fades as we go six months back in time

INT FLASHBACK -- CABRET APARTMENT - NIGHT

The memory has the quality of a SILENT FILM Black-and-white
Simple images The flickering glowing luminescence of early
movies

Hugo and his FATHER live in a poor cramped garret Big
skylight Paris beyond An enormous full moon beyond that

The Automaton -- now in much worse condition battered and
rusty missing parts -- sits before Hugo and his Father
HUGO

An Automaton

HUGO’S FATHER
I found him abandoned in the attic
of the museum

HUGO
What does he do

HUGO’S FATHER
(tinkering with it)

He’s a windup figure like a music

box This is the most

complicated one I’ve ever seen by

far You see This one can write

HUGO
(transfixed)
Who built him

HUGO’S FATHER
I would think a magician

HUGO
A magician

HUGO’S FATHER

That’s right Magicians used
machines like this when I was a
boy No one could figure out how

they danced or walked or sang
(MORE )

HUGOS FATHER (CONTD)
But the secret was always in the
clockwork

HUGO
Can we fix it

HUGO’S FATHER
Oh I don’t know Hugo it’s
awfully rusted and finding the
parts would be
He sees Hugo’s disappointment
HUGO’S FATHER
Of course we can fix it We’re
clock makers aren’t we But
only when I’ve gotten through all
my work at the shop and at the
museum you understand
Hugo hugs him His father smiles

The Automaton seems to watch them

INT FLASHBACK -- CLOCK SHOP - DAY

Music

Hugo sweeps up as his father works fixing clocks

The tiny cramped shop is a jumble of clocks watches gears
movements springs dials

INT FLASHBACK -- MUSEUM - EVENING

Music

Hugo’s father winds and oils clocks in an old museum filled
with Victorian curiosities

INT FLASHBACK -- CABRET APARTMENT - NIGHT

Music

Hugo and his father work on the Automaton together They
huddle at the workbench

Hugo’s father patiently teaches him Hugo learns eagerly

Hugo’s father stops to make a note

We realize he is writing in the NOTEBOOK the one Georges
took

INT FLASHBACK -- MUSEUM - NIGHT

Music

Hugo’s father is working on a stubborn clock at the museum
Then

The music stops

Hugo’s father slowly turns

Curious

He moves to a stairway

Looks down

He sees

A PILLAR OF FLAME

Raging right up at him

INT FLASHBACK -- CABRET APARTMENT - NIGHT
It is very late

Hugo is working on the Automaton

The door opens

He turns eagerly

HUGO
I fixed the gears in the--

But it is not his father
It is his UNCLE CLAUDE Unshaven Greasy Crude Huge

HUGO
Uncle Claude

UNCLE CLAUDE
There was a fire Your father’s
dead Pack your things quickly
Youre coming with me
Hugo stares

EXT FLASHBACK -- STREETS - NIGHT

Hugo lugs the heavy Automaton covered in a sheet as he
follows Uncle Claude through the empty streets

Hugo struggles to keep up with Uncle Claude’s huge gait

UNCLE CLAUDE

Youll be my apprentice You’1l
live with me and I’1l show you how
to take care of them clocks

(Takes a swig from a

flask)
I’m getting too old to be climbing
through them tunnels

They turn a corner
And ahead of them

The Train Station

INT FLASHBACK -- TRAIN STATION -- APARTMENT - NIGHT

Uncle Claude and Hugo enter the secret apartment It is
filthy and rank Dickensian

Hugo sets down the Automaton Looks around

UNCLE CLAUDE
They built these apartments for
them who ran the station years
ago Everyone’s forgotten they’re
here You sleep in the corner

Uncle Claude plops down Drinks

UNCLE CLAUDE
Get some sleep We start work at
five

HUGO
What about school

UNCLE CLAUDE
You’re finished with school There
wont be time for that once you’re
in them walls You should thank
me

Uncle Claude clears his throat Takes a drink Looks away
Hugo carries the Automaton to his corner

He sits

Dazed

Absolutely forlorn

Then he pulls the sheet off the Automaton

He looks into the Automaton’s face

His only friend

They sit together

EXT FLASHBACK -- GRAVEYARD - DAY
Funeral tableau

Hugo and Uncle Claude at the grave site Uncle Claude drinks
from his flask

Hugo bows his head Tears beginning to fall

Color gradually returns as we leave the past and return to

INT TRAIN STATION -- APARTMENT - NIGHT
Hugo sits looking at the Automaton
Alone Despondent

We fade to

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - MORNING
Hugo peers out from behind an air vent
Waiting Watching

Madame Emilie is opening her little cafe Her dachshund
hovers protectively

Monsieur Frick approaches cautiously Bows gallantly and
offers her a newspaper from his kiosk Madame Emilie is
charmed The dachshund attacks this time It chases Monsieur
Frick away Madame Emilie follows in horror
Hugo seizes his opportunity--

He scrambles quickly from the air vent--
Races to the cafe--

Grabs a croissant and bottle of milk--

Runs off--

Disappearing into the crowd of morning commuters

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - MORNING

Hugo moves through the grown up world eating the croissant

No one notices him

He sees the imposing Station Inspector and the ferocious

Maximilian approaching

Hugo moves next to a woman Falls into step Acts like her

son She doesn’t notice

The Station Inspector passes

Hugo continues on

But Maximilian stops Turns Sniffs

STATION INSPECTOR
What is it

He looks Sees nothing

STATION INSPECTOR

We shall be alert my friend We

shall be vigilant

He and Maximilian go

INT TRAIN STATION -- TOY BOOTH - MORNING

Georges is opening the Toy Booth
Hugo stands silently behind him

GEORGES

I thought I might see you today

HUGO
I need my notebook

GEORGES

Why do you need it so badly
HUGO

To help me fix something
GEORGES

What
Hugo doesn’t answer

Georges hands Hugo a handkerchief tied up into a bundle Hugo
unties it

Ashes It is filled with ashes Burned paper

Hugo looks at the ashes Horror and disbelief Tears sting
his eyes

He can’t breathe

The ashes fall

Cascade and swirl delicately down
Over Hugo’s shoes

To the floor

Hugo looks up at Georges

He is shocked to see there are tears in Georges’ eyes as
well

GEORGES
Go away Please just go away

Hugo wipes his eyes with his dirty ashen hands leaving long
black smudges on his face

He backs away
Then he turns and runs off Tears flowing freely now

He races around a corner and--

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - MORNING
--Bang

He runs right into Isabelle She was hiding waiting for him

ISABELLE
Hey

HUGO
Sorry -- I--

ISABELLE

I saw Are you crying

HUGO
No

ISABELLE
Hold still

She uses her handkerchief to dry his eyes and clean his face
as

ISABELLE
There’s nothing wrong with crying
Sidney Carton cries And Heathcliff
too In books they’re crying all
the time

HUGO
(grabs handkerchief )
I can do it

ISABELLE
I have to talk to you It’s
terribly important But not here
We’re too exposed

She dramatically grabs his hand and pulls him off

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - MORNING

Hugo continues to clean his face as they move through a
different part of the station She is carrying a book

HUGO
Where are we going

ISABELLE
Only to the most wonderful place on
earth Neverland and Oz and
Treasure Island all wrapped up into
one

They are approaching Monsieur Rouleau He is at work on his
Surrealist painting
ISABELLE
Good morning Monsieur Rouleau

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
Morning

She stops and looks at the abstract painting

ISABELLE
Oh it’s coming along marvelously

HUGO
What is it

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
It’s the station How I see it
anyway Do you like it

Hugo looks at the painting Takes it seriously Isabelle

appreciates this

HUGO
You know I think I do Yes I
like it very much

Monsieur Rouleau is pleased
ISABELLE
We have to go Well done

Monsieur Rouleau

Hugo and Isabelle go

ISABELLE
He’s a Surrealist
HUGO
Mm
ISABELLE

That’s a kind of painter

HUGO
I know what a Surrealist is I’m
not an idiot

ISABELLE
Ah here we are

Ahead of them

Her secret realm Wonderland and Oz and Treasure
all wrapped up into one

Island

A used bookstore

They enter

INT TRAIN STATION -- BOOKSTORE - MORNING

A little bell jangles when they enter

MONSIEUR LABISSE the shop owner is perched high on a stool
at the front of the store like the Caterpillar from ALICE IN
WONDERLAND peering over a stack of dusty books

He is a slight sad sort of man He brightens when he sees
Isabelle But he is extremely suspicious of Hugo

ISABELLE
Good morning Monsieur Labisse may
I present Monsieur Hugo Cabret a
very old and dear boon companion

MONSIEUR LABISSE
(bows )
Monsieur Cabret

HUGO
Hello

ISABELLE
(handing him book)
Thank you for this I think I’m
halfway in love with David
Copperfield Photography

MONSIEUR LABISSE
(points)
Back corner left top shelf

ISABELLE
Thank you

Monsieur Labisse watches them go Hugo’s dirty clothes and
long hair convince him he must be a shoplifter -- or worse

Isabelle leads Hugo deeper into the store
It is a world of books Stacked in every direction To the
ceiling Rivers of books Mountains of books Gloriously

cluttered

HUGO
Listen what’s so important
ISABELLE
Papa Georges still has your
notebook He didn’t burn it That
was all a trick

HUGO
Why

She climbs a ladder in search of a book

ISABELLE
I don’t know The notebook made him
very upset He and Mama Jeanne
stayed up late talking about it I
think he was crying

Hugo thinks about this How strange

HUGO
It’s a mystery

ISABELLE
I know

HUGO

Why are you helping me

ISABELLE
Because this might be an adventure
I’ve never had one outside of
books

She grabs a book Comes back down the ladder

ISABELLE
I think we should be very
clandestine

HUGO
Okay

ISABELLE
By the way my name’s Isabelle
Do you want a book Monsieur
Labisse lets me borrow them I
could get one for you

HUGO
No

ISABELLE
(horrified)
Don’t you like books

HUGO
No I do My father and I used
to read Jules Verne together
He stops
She senses his strong emotion Respects it
They move to Monsieur Labisse at the front counter
ISABELLE
(re book)
May I

MONSIEUR LABISSE
Of course Good day Isabelle

Monsieur Labisse watches Hugo with suspicion as they leave
the shop

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - MORNING

They move through the bustling station

HUGO
How do I get my notebook back

ISABELLE
I think you should stand up to him
He’ll respect that Don’t tell
him we talked I’1l help you if I
can Be steadfast
She disappears into the crowd

He watches her go

Be steadfast What a peculiar girl

INT TRAIN STATION -- TOY BOOTH - DAY

Georges is sitting at the counter Evenly staring at
something

He aimlessly cuts and re-cuts a deck of cards with one hand
as he stares

We finally see what he is staring at

Hugo stands there on the other side of the counter Staring
back at him Steadfast

It is like a showdown

Finally
HUGO
I don’t believe you burned my
notebook
GEORGES
You don’t Well maybe I did

and maybe I didn’t You’ll never
know will you

Hugo holds his ground

GEORGES
Shall I call the Station Inspector

Hugo holds his ground

GEORGES
Go away

Hugo holds his ground

Georges glares at him

Hugo glares back

A long beat

Gunfighters

Neither blinks

Then

Georges slowly reaches under the counter
He pulls something out

Something covered in a handkerchief
He sets it on the counter

With the panache of a magician he pulls off the handkerchief
to reveal

The toy mouse that Hugo broke earlier

GEORGES
Fix it

Hugo looks at him

GEORGES
I said fix it

HUGO
I need my tools

Georges pulls out a canister of tiny screwdrivers pliers
files and hammers

GEORGES
I know you’ve been stealing parts
from the shop Might as well use
those you haven’t stolen yet

Hugo looks at the broken toy mouse Then at Georges

HUGO
If I fix it do I get my notebook
GEORGES
Well see
A challenge
Hugo starts to work
He uses the tiny tools hammering screwing
adjusting tinkering

Georges watches

Hugo fixes the spring fits the key hammers the
body

Finally he sets the toy mouse down on the counter
Georges looks at it

He winds it

The toy mouse skitters playfully across the counter
Georges is impressed tries not to show it

HUGO
Give me my notebook

GEORGES
Youve got a bit of talent But
youll have to prove there’s more
to you than being a thief You
can earn your notebook
Hugo bravely goes into the booth and gets a broom

HUGO
How

GEORGES
Come to the booth everyday I’1l
decide how long you must work for
each item you stole and it will be
up to me to decide when you have
earned your notebook if ever

HUGO
I already have a job

GEORGES
Thief is not a job boy

HUGO
I have another job but I’11 come
when I can

GEORGES
You begin tomorrow Go away

HUGO
I’1l1 begin now

Starts sweeping up

Georges watches him

Across the station a little DANCE BAND is starting up at
Madame Emilie’s cafe

A few couples dance

An afternoon tea dance

A lovely
iron ribs

The music

The music

INT EXT

- MONTAGE - DAYNIGHT

Dance band music as

-- Hugo works at the Toy Booth Across the booth Georges
does a card trick Hugo watches the trick closely Georges

notices

- Isabelle and Hugo walk through the bookstore chatting
Monsieur Labisse eyes Hugo with suspicion
- Georges teaches Hugo how to do the card trick
Hugo demonstrates the card trick to the Automaton
Hugo repairs a broken toy in the booth Isabelle is
there chatting to him He ducks away when the Station

Inspector and Maximilian pass She is intrigued

Georges watches Hugo demonstrate the card trick to a
customer He hides a smile

- Hugo works on the Automaton It looks done polished
cleaned beautiful and ready But for one thing We now see
that there is HEART-SHAPED KEYHOLE in the back

Hugo tries a bit of bent metal in the keyhole Doesn’t
fit He adds it to a collection of scavenged items he has
tried Nothing fits

-- Isabelle and Hugo playfully dance to the band at the cafe
with other couples

» Georges watches them dance Content

The band dance ends the song with a flourish Hugo bows
to Isabelle She laughs

The montage ends

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - DAY
Hugo is waiting for Isabelle outside the book shop

He sees the Station Inspector and Maximilian cutting through
the crowd Hugo ducks around a corner and watches nervously

But the Station Inspector has another quarry today

A young STREET KID around Hugo’s age is loitering near
another shop

The Station Inspector stalks him and then sweeps down like a
bird of prey The Street Kid makes a move to bolt--

But the Station Inspector releases Maximilian who leaps
crouches and snarls in front of the terrified Kid--

The Station Inspector grabs the Kid brutally Shakes him

STATION INSPECTOR
Where are you parents Answer me
STREET KID
(terrified)
Got none
Without another word the Station Inspector drags him away
his leg brace squeaking ominously Maximilian loping after

them

Hugo darts into an air vent

INT TRAIN STATION -- NARROW PASSAGEINSPECTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

Hugo is in a cramped passage that overlooks the Station
Inspector’s office peering through a clock face

The Street Kid is in a tiny awful cell He is sobbing
Maximilian sits alert glaring in at the Kid

The Station Inspector is oiling his leg brace as he talks on
the phone

STATION INSPECTOR
(on phone)
- yes another one Useless waste
of an orphan by the looks of it
Come get it
Suddenly--

Maximilian turns Looks toward Hugo ears perked

Hugo sinks back into the darkness

INT TRAIN STATION -- TUNNELS - DAY

Hugo watches through a clock face

He sees the Station Inspector dragging the Street Kid through
the doors of the station and throwing him into a police
truck The truck roars off

The Station Inspector comes back inside

He stands looking over his domain Maximilian at his side
Imperious

Hugo disappears back into the tunnels

We linger for a moment with the Station Inspector His eyes
scan the terminal Then he stops

He watches LISETTE A beautiful and shy girl who runs a
little flower stall She’s organizing bunches of flowers
They surround her an explosion of vibrant color in the
terminal

The Station Inspector gazes at her He’s besotted has been
for a while

He gets up his nerve Puts on an awkward smile He
begins to approach

But then his leg brace squeaks sharply It echoes through the
terminal He stops Embarrassed

He gives up Moves off with Maximilian

INT TRAIN STATION -- BOOKSTORE - DAY
Hugo and Isabelle move through the bookstore

ISABELLE
- I’m still looking for your
notebook I have to be very

circumspect
She loves the word

HUGO
You better not look inside

ISABELLE
If I find it I should be able to
look inside it

HUGO
Then don’t look for it

ISABELLE
I’m trying to help Why are you
being so mean

To Hugo she suddenly looks very grown up She is disappointed
in him His heart sinks

HUGO
Just Promise me you won’t open
it

ISABELLE

Fine

They wander deeper into the store

Monsieur Labisse perched on his high stool keeps an wary
eye on Hugo

Hugo picks up a copy of ROBIN HOOD smiles
HUGO

I saw this movie With Douglas
Fairbanks Did you see that

ISABELLE
I’ve never seen a movie
HUGO
What
ISABELLE
Isn’t it appalling
HUGO
Youve never seen a movie Not
ever
ISABELLE

Papa Georges won’t let me He’s
very strict about it

HUGO
(excited)
I love movies My father always
took me for my birthday

Hugo is surprised he suddenly spoke about his father He does
not regret it though

They wander through the teetering piles of books in silence

ISABELLE
Is your father dead

HUGO
I don’t want to talk about it

A beat

She takes his hand for a quick moment then releases it
A gesture of support Friendship

They continue strolling

Hugo stops An idea He looks at her

HUGO
Isabelle Do you want to have an
adventure
Her eyes light up
EXT MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

Again the suggestion of Paris

A movie theatre facade An Art Deco marquee A green neon
sign Silent Movie Festival

Isabelle and Hugo stand looking up at the theatre

She looks at him Beams

He nods his head and nonchalantly leads her down an alley
next to the theatre

EXT ALLEY NEXT TO THEATRE - DAY

They move down the alley passing a series of fading movie
posters Keaton Lon Chaney Doug Fairbanks

He stops at a side door and begins to deftly pick the lock
with one of his tools

ISABELLE
We could get into trouble

HUGO
That’s how you know it’s an
adventure
Click
He opens the door and peeks in Coast is clear
He looks at her
Yes or no

She’s game

They sneak in

INT MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

The flickering light above

The glowing screen

Iridescent

Hugo and Isabelle are sitting at the back

The famous Harold Lloyd film SAFETY LAST is playing
Isabelle’s eyes are wide

She’s transported

The magic of motion pictures

She’s never seen one before Life captured on the screen
Living moving history

The iridescent glow from the screen illuminates her face
Hugo glances to her

Her enchantment touches him

He smiles

The light flickers above them

Time passes

It’s the climax of SAFETY LAST

Isabelle is wrapped up in the movie

Can barely watch

Can barely breathe

Harold Lloyd is climbing dangerously around the outside of
the skyscraper Acrobatic stunts still hair-raising after all
these years Harold Lloyd grabs the big clock face It
springs open--

Isabelle grabs Hugo’s arm in horror--

Hugo looks at her Amused

Harold Lloyd clings to the hands of the clock and then
continues to climb around the building

Then
From the darkness behind Hugo and Isabelle

Two huge white hands slowly descend

Like the Frankenstein Monster’s mitts
Grabbing them on the shoulder
They jump
The THEATRE MANAGER looms over them
THEATRE MANAGER
How did you two rats get in here
EXT MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
The Manager dumps them outside
THEATRE MANAGER
And I better not see you in here
again
He closes the doors

Hugo and Isabelle laugh and run off

EXT BANK OF THE SEINE - DAY
It is chilly Fog
Hugo and Isabelle walk home along the Seine

The silhouette of bridges The sound of lapping water The
shape of boats moving past Radio music from a houseboat

Hugo tightrope walks along the edge of the bank like Harold
Lloyd on a ledge from SAFETY LAST

HUGO
Why doesn’t Papa Georges let you go
to the movies

ISABELLE
I don’t know He never said I bet
my parents would have let me I’m
sure they were very aesthetic

HUGO
What happened to them

ISABELLE
They died when I was a baby Papa
Georges and Mama Jeanne are my
godparents so they took me in
(MORE )
ISABELLE (CONTD)
Theyre very nice about most
everything except the movies

HUGO
My father took me to the movies all
the time We saw Tom Mix and Lon
Chaney But Douglas Fairbanks was
my favorite

Hugo sword fights along the bank for a moment
A beat as they walk

ISABELLE
What was he like

HUGO

He loved the movies Ever since
he was a kid and the movies were
new He told me about the first one
he ever saw He went into a dark
room and on a white screen he saw a
rocket fly into the eye of the man
in the moon

(smiles)
He said it was like seeing his
dreams in the middle of the day

A beat as they walk He speaks quietly
HUGO

The movies were our special place
It was just us We’d go in and

watch something and fora
little while we didn’t miss my mom
so much

She’s touched by his honesty

ISABELLE
You think about him a lot

HUGO
All the time

A beat as they walk

ISABELLE
Who looks after you
HUGO
My uncle was supposed to But he

started going away a lot Drinking
(MORE )

HUGO (CONTD)
Staying out all night One day
he didn’t come back

ISABELLE
So you’re all alone

HUGO
Not completely

A beat as they walk
She stops

ISABELLE
Hugo Where do you live

He stops

Looks at her

Should he tell her
Should he trust her
Yes

He points

HUGO
There

She looks
Across the river

The Train Station

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - DAY
Hugo and Isabelle move through the crowd
She is incredulous

HUGO
-- My uncle taught me how to run
the clocks So I just keep on doing
it Maybe he’ll come back one
day but I doubt it

ISABELLE
But Aren’t you afraid someone
will find out

HUGO
Not as long as the clocks keep on
working and no one sees me

ISABELLE
What do you do for money

HUGO
Don’t need any

A beat as they walk

ISABELLE
Can I see it
HUGO
What
ISABELLE
Where you live In the walls
HUGO
Maybe
ISABELLE
Maybe

Hugo suddenly sees
The Station Inspector and Maximilian
Walking right toward them

HUGO
Act natural

ISABELLE
What

HUGO
Just keep walking Act natural

ISABELLE
(perplexed)
How am I acting now
Then she sees the Station Inspector and Maximilian

She understands

They put on an elaborate show of “acting natural” as they
walk toward the Station Inspector

They pass him
A sigh of relief

But

The Station Inspector stops

Turns His leg brace squeaks like a rifle shot

STATION INSPECTOR
Hey You two

Hugo and Isabelle freeze

STATION INSPECTOR
Come here

Hugo is about to bolt
Isabelle sees it in his eyes
With a look she cautions him against it

She will handle this another way

She drags him back to the Station Inspector Puts on her

sweetest face

ISABELLE
Good day Monsieur

STATION INSPECTOR
(icy)
Where are your parents

ISABELLE
I work with my Papa Georges at the
Toy Booth surely you’ve seen me
there And this is my cousin from
the country Hugo

(Whispers )

You’1l have to forgive him he’s a
little simple-minded Doltish
really Poor thing

The Station Inspector leans in
Peers closely at Hugo
Hugo gives him a simple-minded look

Maximilian noses right up to Hugo

Sniffing A low growl

STATION INSPECTOR
It seems Maximilian disapproves of
you little creature Why would
he disapprove of you

HUGO
I don’t know

ISABELLE

(to the rescue)
Perhaps he smells my cat
Christina Rossetti’s her name
after the poetess Would you like
me to recite “My heart is like a
singing birdWhose nest is in a
watered shoot--”

STATION INSPECTOR
All right all right Go on then
- But remember in my terminal
children are not permitted to run
amok Not ever

He gives them a last chilling glare and goes They see him go
into this office shut the door They’re free of him for the
moment

Hugo looks at Isabelle

HUGO
Doltish

ISABELLE
It worked didn’t it

They continue on

ISABELLE
Now since I just saved your life
how about letting me see your
covert lair

HUGO
My what

ISABELLE
Where you live in the walls

HUGO
I can’t understand what you’re
saying half the time

ISABELLE
That’s because I am so gigantically
literate

HUGO

I’1ll tell you what I’1ll let you
see my “covert lair” if you do one

thing

ISABELLE
What’s that

HUGO
You have to

ISABELLE
Yes

HUGO
Catch me

And he is off like a shot--

Isabelle laughs and pursues--

A wild chase through the station

It is nice to see Hugo enjoying himself His usually sober
face is smiling His serious personality gives way to simple
play

He’s just a kid now

Having fun with his friend

Hugo tears through the station

Past the cafe

Leaping over Madame Emilie’s yapping dachshund

Careening around Monsieur Rouleau’s easel

Barreling through the terminal

Isabelle follows Laughing

This is all from a child’s perspective We cut past towering
adults Weaving in and out Diving under platform gates
Scrambling over benches

And at top speed

Sliding and skidding wildly on the polished floors
44

Carefree

Then Hugo diverts quickly through a door into--

INT TRAIN STATION -- LUGGAGE ROOM - DAY
Hugo sweeps past towers of luggage--

He jumps and climbs over a cart piled high with luggage and
steamer trunks--—

Isabelle follows gamely laughing bouncing after him--

They slam through a door to--

INT TRAIN STATION -- CROWDED CORRIDOR - DAY
Suddenly--

A tight corridor Scores of passengers moving swiftly A
great crowd Too many

Hugo and Isabelle are unexpectedly caught in the mob of
passengers The passengers are hurrying Late In a rush

Too many big people pushing them back and forth crowding
them jostling them

Isabelle trips

She falls

Amidst the pounding crush of feet
Scary

Hugo turns

His face

Concern

He pushes back

Reaches for her

His hand stretches out

She takes his hand

Her face

Grateful

He pulls her up to safety

The crowd thins out around them

But he is staring at something amazed

In the action a necklace has emerged from her collar A key
on a piece of string

A distinctive heart-shaped key

HUGO
Where did you get that

ISABELLE
None of your business

She tucks the key away

HUGO
I need it

ISABELLE
What for

HUGO
I just need it

ISABELLE
Not unless you tell me why

He looks at her

INT TRAIN STATION -- TUNNELS - DAY
Hugo leads her through the tunnels

ISABELLE
This is marvelous I feel like
Jean Valjean

HUGO
I used to imagine I was the Phantom
of the Opera Like in the movie

ISABELLE
It was a book too You know
sometimes things are books before
they’re movies

He leads her through the iron door to

INT TRAIN STATION -- SECRET APARTMENT - DAY
Hugo lights some candles

She takes the apartment in The cramped quarters The chaos
of tools and machine parts hanging everywhere She loves it

ISABELLE
Oh this is superlative

Hugo pulls a sheet off the Automaton
She is instantly captivated by the wonderful machine

ISABELLE
What is it

HUGO
It’s an automaton My father was
fixing it before he died

ISABELLE
Why would my key fit your father’s
machine That doesn’t make any

sense

They look at the Automaton for a moment

ISABELLE
He looks sad
HUGO
I think he’s just waiting
ISABELLE
For what
HUGO

To work again To do what he’s
supposed to do

ISABELLE
What happens when you wind him up

HUGO
I don’t know

She takes off her necklace
Hands it to him
He fills the Automaton’s little inkwell with ink

He puts a fresh piece of paper on the little writing desk

It’s ready
Hugo pauses

ISABELLE
What’s the matter

HUGO
I know it’s silly but I think
it’s going to be a message from my
father

ISABELLE
Do you want me to go

He shakes his head

A beat

Then he carefully inserts the key
And winds the Automaton

Steps back

The world hangs in suspense
Nothing happens

He looks at her

She doesn’t know what to say
He looks back at the Automaton
Nothing

But

Then we go

INSIDE the Automaton’s body
Things begins to move

A cascade of perfect movements with hundreds of brilliantly
calibrated actions

A spring connects to a series of gears

The gears extend down to the base of the figure and turn
brass disks

Two little hammers come down and trail along the edges of the
disks

The little hammers translate motion back up through a series
of rods

The rods silently turn other intricate mechanisms in the
figure’s shoulder and neck

The shoulder gears move
Engaging the elbow

Setting off a chain reaction of movements down to the
wrist

And finally

The hand

OUTSIDE again

Hugo and Isabelle watch

The Automaton’s hand moves slightly Just a twitch

They gasp

Hugo and Isabelle lean forward wide-eyed with wonder

The miniature hand begins very cautiously to move

Hugo and Isabelle hold their breath

The Automaton dips the pen into the ink and begins to write

It draws a small line The hand moves Another small line
The hand moves Another small line

Hugo and Isabelle lean closer

The Automaton continues to move Dip the pen Draw a line
Move Draw a line Dip the pen Move Draw a line

But it is meaningless

A series of scratches and lines without order
Nothing

Hugo stares

His heart sinking
Then the Automaton stops
Finished
Hugo is devastated
HUGO
What an idiot -- Thinking I could
fix it--

ISABELLE
Hugo--

HUGO
It’s broken It’ll always be
broken
Anguish beyond tears

She doesn’t know what to do

She goes to him Trying to comfort

ISABELLE
Hugo You can still--

HUGO
You don’t understand I thought if
I could fix it I wouldn’t be so

alone
He buries his head in his hands
A long beat
Then she notices something

The Automaton is moving again

ISABELLE
Hugo Hugo look -- look
He glances up
ISABELLE

It’s not done It’s not done
They rush back to the Automaton

It is moving more quickly now All the gears and
spinning perfectly Draw-move-ink-draw-move

Hugo realizes

wheels

HUGO
It’s not writing It’s drawing

Indeed it is
Faster and faster A blur of ink Lines forming together
Shading and cross-hatching Draw-move-draw-move-ink-draw-move-
draw
An image begins to emerge
We don’t see it entirely
We see bits and pieces Something familiar about it
Hugo and Isabelle stare
Finally the Automaton stops
It waits
Pen poised
Hugo and Isabelle exchange a glance
And we finally see the image in full
And recognize it instantly
A TRIP TO THE MOON

The round face of the man in the moon Rocket protruding from
his right eye

Hugo’s father’s favorite movie The very image he told Hugo
about

Hugo is trembling

Suddenly--

The Automaton starts moving again--

Hugo and Isabelle jump--

The Automaton dips the pen and moves its hand into position
And signs the drawing

“Georges Melies”

A flourish under the signature and then the Automaton is
done

ISABELLE
“Georges Melies” That’s Papa
Georges’ name Why did your
father’s machine sign Papa Georges’
name

HUGO
I don’t know

ISABELLE
And why does my key fit it

Hugo shakes his head
He just looks at the Automaton
He smiles

HUGO
Thank you

He turns to her
HUGO
It was a message from my father

Now we have to figure it out

She is delighted A mystery

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING
The sun is sinking
Hugo and Isabelle approach the apartment building

Hugo who has watched it so often from outside hesitates at
going in

ISABELLE
Come on

They enter

INT APARTMENT -— EVENING
Impoverished gentility

A few small rooms Neatly kept Old furniture Fading
wallpaper

MAMA JEANNE Georges’ wife is sewing in a corner She wears
heavy reading glasses She is a handsome older woman

Isabelle and Hugo enter

MAMA JEANNE
Isabelle

ISABELLE
(kisses her)
Mama Jeanne we have to talk to you
This is Hugo Cabret

HUGO
Good evening ma’am

MAMA JEANNE
Very good manners for a thief

HUGO
I’m not a thief

Jeanne considers him coolly over her glasses Removes them

MAMA JEANNE
What’s going on Isabelle

ISABELLE
(excited)
Oh well it’s a terribly long
story filled with circumlocutions
It all began several weeks ago when
I was
Hugo stops her

HUGO
Wait

He pulls something from inside his coat
A piece of paper Folded over
He hands it to Mama Jeanne She unfolds it

It is the picture the Automaton drew The image from A TRIP
TO THE MOON

She stares down at it

A complex range of emotions pass over her features shock
nostalgia sadness

When she looks up at them there are tears in her eyes

Isabelle is struck by the sight
MAMA JEANNE
Children What have you done

ISABELLE
Mama Jeanne

Mama Jeanne dries her eyes with a little handkerchief
Isabelle finds there are tears in her eyes as well
Hugo sees Isabelle’s tears Feels awful

MAMA JEANNE
Where did you get it

HUGO
You’11 call me a liar

MAMA JEANNE
No child

HUGO
A mechanical man drew it

MAMA JEANNE
You have him

HUGO
My father found him in a museum No
one wanted him We fixed him

MAMA JEANNE
But it needed
(She realizes Looks at
Isabelle)
My key

Isabelle removes the key

MAMA JEANNE
The key I gave you

A beat as it all sinks in
Then she stands
She hands the drawing back to Hugo
MAMA JEANNE
Please take it away We can’t
dredge up the past now And

whatever happens don’t let Papa
Georges see it

HUGO
Please tell us what’s going on

She begins to lead Hugo to the door
MAMA JEANNE
It’s no business of yours You must
forget all this
Hugo stops Holds his ground
HUGO
We worked hard to fix it my father
and me and it’s all I have
left of him I need to know what
it means
A beat
Mama Jeanne looks at him
Moved by his passion and need
She looks at him seriously Speaks with great compassion
MAMA JEANNE
There are things you are too young
to understand You should not
yet know such sadness
Then

They hear someone climbing up the stairs to the apartment

ISABELLE
It’s Papa Georges

MAMA JEANNE
He can’t know you’re here This
way

She quickly leads them through the apartment to the master
bedroom
INT APARTMENT -- MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING
Mama Jeanne hurries them in
MAMA JEANNE
Just keep quiet I’1l find a way to

get him out of the apartment Not a
noise from either of you

She inadvertently glances toward a large armoire Hugo and
Isabelle both notice
Then she quickly goes Shutting the door
A long beat
Hugo and Isabelle look at each other

They hear the muffled sounds of Mama Jeanne and Georges
talking in another room

Whispers

HUGO
She looked at the armoire

ISABELLE
I already searched it when I was
looking for your notebook

HUGO
I’1l1 look again You stand guard

ISABELLE
Splendid

Hugo opens the armoire and searches through it

Isabelle meanwhile goes to the door

Peeks through the keyhole

Through the keyhole Georges and Jeanne are across the
apartment in the kitchen She is pouring coffee She steals

a nervous glance to the bedroom door

Hugo rifles through the armoire Clothes Sheets No clues
No treasure Nothing

Hugo steps back studies the outside of the tall armoire
He notices something

A decorative panel at the very top of the armoire has two
thin parallel cracks in it

HUGO
Look

ISABELLE
We have to investigate

He carries a chair to the armoire

ISABELLE
Let me I’m taller

She climbs up on the chair and examines the decorative panel
She has to stand on her tiptoes to reach it

He makes a gesture for her to knock on it

She does so

It sounds hollow

They are both excited

She carefully grips the edges of the decorative panel She
pulls She pulls again The panel comes off in her hands
Revealing

A hidden compartment at the top of the armoire

A large box is inside the compartment

Isabelle hands down the panel to Hugo Then she begins to
pull the box out But it is heavy She struggles a bit

He holds the chair steady
She almost has the box out now

But it is ungainly she was unprepared for the weight and
she is still balancing on her tiptoes

As she pulls the box out

She loses her balance

The chair lurches

She almost falls

But miraculously gets her balance
Shoots a relieved glance down to Hugo
But

Then a leg of the chair SNAPS--

She falls--

Shrieks--

Hugo catches her--

The box falls-—-

CRASHES to the floor--

SMASHING open-—-

Sending up a cyclone of paper--

Hundreds of pieces of paper of every shape and size scatter
across the floor and fly through the air--

Hugo and Isabelle are surrounded by a tornado of paper it
swirls around them--

On the paper--

Wonderful drawings Fanciful and imaginative Dragons and
devils Spaceships and submarines Fairies and fish
Elaborate landscapes of fantasy

One of the drawings seems to slow as it whirls past Hugo

The man in the moon a rocket protruding from his right
eye

The swirling papers finally descend to earth
Revealing

Georges

Standing in the doorway Mama Jeanne behind him

Georges looks at the carpet of drawings spread out before
him

GEORGES
(whispers )
Back from the dead

His quiet anguish gives way to anger--
He wades into the drawings--
Grabbing handfuls--
Tearing them up--
Shredding them violently--
Flinging them away--

Mama Jeanne grabs him

MAMA JEANNE
Stop it Georges Stop This is
your work

GEORGES
My work -- What am I Nothing but
a penniless merchant A broken

windup toy

He spins on Hugo in fury

GEORGES
I trusted you -- and this is how
you thank me You cruel -- cruel--

Suddenly he can’t speak--
Something’s wrong -- he gulps for air--

Mama Jeanne sits him on the bed He is exhausted gasping for
breath

His sad eyes gaze over the chaos of drawings
He whispers
GEORGES
An empty box an old rocket a lost
monster nothing nothing
nothing
MAMA JEANNE
I’m sorry Georges I’m so
sorry
Isabelle takes Hugo’s arm and gently pulls him out
He glances back

Sees Mama Jeanne tenderly holding her disconsolate husband

Hugo is haunted by the poignant image

EXT APARTMENT - EVENING

Evening Street lamps are coming on illuminate the scene
Isabelle is at the front door

A beat

ISABELLE
I should go back

HUGO
Okay
A beat

ISABELLE
I’ve never seen him cry before

Hugo takes her hand
A comforting gesture of friendship
She acknowledges it
A faint smile
She starts to close the door Stops
ISABELLE

Thank you for the movie today

It was a gift
She shuts the door
Hugo walks down the street
He stops under the street lamp for a moment Gazing back up
at the apartment
INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - EVENING
Hugo enters Deep in thought Head down
He’s not looking and accidentally bumps right into--

The frosty Monsieur Labisse Labisse drops a few books he was
carrying Hugo quickly picks them up

HUGO
Oh I’m sorry sir

He notices one of the books is the ROBIN HOOD he was looking
at before He smiles when he sees it

MONSIEUR LABISSE
You know that volume

HUGO
I used to read it with my father

MONSIEUR LABISSE
Hm It was intended for my

godson
(MORE )

MONSIEUR LABISSE (CONTD)
But now I think it is intended for
you
(slight formal bow)
Monsieur Cabret

Labisse goes leaving Hugo with the book Hugo is shocked by
his unexpected act of kindness

A voice

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
Things aren’t always what they
seem

Hugo turns Monsieur Rouleau is working on his painting
nearby Hugo goes to him

HUGO
Why would he give it to me

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
Because you needed it

Hugo looks at Monsieur Rouleau’s Surrealist painting It is
like Magritte or Dali But the images echo Hugo’s story A
robot A train A clock

HUGO
I recognize the clock But it’s
different

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
Sitting here day after day I
watch things I watch them change
in the light A clock becomes a
wheel becomes a train becomes a
rocket becomes a robot It’s
like a story

HUGO
How does it end

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
I don’t know The story’s not over
yet

There’s something gently magical and mad about Monsieur
Rouleau touched and touching

He mixes some paint on his palette

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
But it’1ll be surprising

HUGO
Because things aren’t always what
they seem

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
Well look around you Not all
clocks run forever not all
little boys live in houses and
not all messages are written on
paper

Hugo is struck by his words

MONSTEUR ROULEAU
Quick behind the canvas

Hugo sees the Station Inspector approaching He ducks behind
Monsieur Rouleau’s large canvas

The Station Inspector arrives

STATION INSPECTOR
Monsieur Artiste How goes the
painting May I look

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
(stops him)
Not ready yet Soon Things must
happen at the opportune moment

The Station Inspector looks across the terminal to the lovely
Lisette at her flower stall The object of his affection

He sighs

STATION INSPECTOR
If we only knew when that moment
was

MONSTEUR ROULEAU
For the heart there is only now
my friend

STATION INSPECTOR
Do you think

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
Of course Go say hello to her
Go on give me your best smile

The Station Inspector tries out his best and brightest smile
sort of a pained grimace

MONSTEUR ROULEAU
Ahh Radiant

The Station Inspector is encouraged He steels himself and
walks away toward Lisette

Hugo emerges from hiding

HUGO
Thank you sir Your painting is
going to be magnificent

Hugo scurries off
Monsieur Rouleau watches him go

MONSIEUR ROULEAU
So is yours

Meanwhile

The Station Inspector heads toward Lisette at the flower
stall She’s arranging a breathtaking bunch of blue irises
like a vision from Monet

He freshens his maladroit smile and “casually” arrives

STATION INSPECTOR
Mademoiselle Lisette a very
gracious good evening to you

LISETTE

(shy)
Monsieur Inspector

STATION INSPECTOR
Hm Yes Those are lovely posies
there

LISETTE
They’re from Gourdon They come in
on the overnight train

STATION INSPECTOR
Ah Gourdon Splendid country that
All the cows and such Do
they have a smell

He leans in to sniff the irises This causes his leg brace to
squeak awkwardly He stiffens

She glances to his brace He sees her glance

A moment between them

He nods stiffly Turns to go
Walks a few steps

But then he stops No He will not be ashamed He
returns to her

STATION INSPECTOR
You see I was injured in the war
It will never heal Good evening
to you Mademoiselle
He turns to go But

LISETTE
I lost my brother

STATION INSPECTOR
Where

LISETTE
Verdun

His eyes are sympathetic He was there He knows
A beat
Neither is sure what to do How to proceed

Then she smiles shyly snaps off a blossom and tucks it into
his lapel

LISETTE
Good evening Monsieur Inspector

STATION INSPECTOR
(bows )
Good evening Mademoiselle Lisette

He goes His leg brace squeaking proudly

And we fade to

EXT FILM ACADEMY BUILDING - DAY
A wide boulevard

Fine motorcars

Magisterial buildings

A part of Paris we have not seen before Wealth and
privilege

Hugo and Isabelle look particularly small standing in front
of the most august building on the street The French Film
Academy

Two great stone lions flank the entrance The lions gaze
balefully at them as if annoyed at their presumption

They summon their courage and enter

INT FILM ACADEMY -- LOBBY - DAY

Hugo and Isabelle’s heels click as they cross an enormous
marble void to the reception desk

The RECEPTIONIST -- a stern dragon of a woman -- watches
their approach as balefully as did the lions outside

They finally reach her

ISABELLE
Excuse me Madame--

She stops -- her voice echoes in the massive chamber --
continues more quietly

ISABELLE
Excuse me we would like to use the
library

She looks them up and down

RECEPTIONIST
No
ISABELLE
No
RECEPTIONIST
Youre too small and too dirty
Goodbye

She returns to her paperwork

They stand for a moment

Isabelle starts to go Hugo stops her

He addresses the dragon receptionist
HUGO

Excuse me I thought the library
was open to all Frenchmen

RECEPTIONIST
Not small and dirty ones

HUGO
In that case
(clears his throat
nervously)
I would like to see your superior

She looks at him Daggers
RECEPTIONIST

What kind of dreadful little
Jacobin are you

HUGO
The kind that wants to use the
library
He holds his ground
INT FILM ACADEMY -- LIBRARY - DAY

Hugo and Isabelle move through a lovely library

Two stories Shining brass fixtures and rich wooden shelves
Neats rows of books

They go to the circulation desk The bored STUDENT manning
the desk doesn’t even glance up from his book

HUGO
Excuse me sir we’re looking for a
book about very early movies

BORED STUDENT
(points without looking)
Rene Tabard THE INVENTION OF
DREAMS Row Four Section Three
Top shelf

ISABELLE
Much obliged What are you reading

Hugo hauls her away

They move through the stacks to find Row Four Section Three
They pull down a large book from the top shelf

They go to a library table and look at the book

THE INVENTION OF DREAMS THE STORY OF THE FIRST MOVIES by
Rene Tabard

Hugo runs his hands over the cover

He glances to Isabelle

This could be it The answer to their quest
He opens the book

They begin to read

HUGO (VO)

“In 1895 one of the very first
films ever shown was called A TRAIN
ARRIVES IN THE STATION which
showed nothing more than a train
coming into a station”

We see the little film of the train steaming into the
station

ISABELLE (VO)
“But when the train came speeding
toward the screen the audience
screamed because they thought they
were in danger of being run over
No one had ever seen anything like
it before”

Hugo smiles to her
HUGO
No one had ever seen anything like
it before
They turn the page
And we go with them
INTO THE BOOK
Flickering images from the very first movies
Fragile fragments of life captured forever
A stream of factory workers leaving work Two Edison
technicians dancing Skyscrapers in New York London
street scene a boxing match
HUGO (VO)
“What began as a sideshow novelty
soon grew into something more as
the first filmmakers discovered

they could use the new medium to
tell stories”

And now we see storytelling and narrative replacing the
quaint real life images

Edison’s THE KISS THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY THE CABINET

OF DR CALIGARI INTOLERANCE Buster Keaton Louise
Brooks William S Hart Doug Fairbanks Jean
Renoir

The splendid magical romantic lost world of silent movies
flickers past

And then
The culmination of the whole sequence
We end at one iconic image
Glowing with light
A TRIP TO THE MOON
The man in the moon with a rocket protruding from his eye
Hugo and Isabelle stare at the image
They share an excited glance
ISABELLE
(reads )
“The filmmaker Georges Melies was
among the first to realized that
film had the power to capture
dreams”
HUGO
(reads )
“This great pioneer of early cinema

died during the Great War--”

ISABELLE
Died

HUGO
(reads )
“Died during the Great War”

They stop Stunned

Unbeknownst to them a tall and imposing figure has been
looming over them Observing

PROFESSOR RENE TABARD is a formidable presence Stern and
uncompromising

TABARD
Youre interested in Melies
The kids jump -- slam the book shut almost guiltily
HUGO
Yes uh--
ISABELLE

It’s allowed

TABARD
Is it

A long cool appraising stare

Then Hugo realizes something -- he nudges Isabelle -- the
photo on the back of the book shows the author

Rene Tabard The same man who is standing before them

TABARD
Come with me

INT FILM ACADEMY -- TABARD’S OFFICE - DAY
A door opens into the world of Georges Melies
Professor Tabard’s office is something of a shrine to Melies

Tattered old movie posters film stills and handbills for
magic shows line the walls

Mountains of books photographs and archival records Also a
few props and costume pieces lovingly preserved

Tabard shows Hugo and Isabelle some of the photographs and
artifacts

TABARD
Here he is at work in his studio
And this is a handbill
advertising his stage act And
this is one of his actual cameras

ISABELLE
Why do you have all this

TABARD
Your godfather is a passion of
mine He was a great filmmaker

HUGO
(looking at a photo)
He was a magician

They look at a photo of showing a YOUNG GEORGES on a stage
doing a magic trick

TABARD
Yes he began on the stage

ISABELLE
How did he start making movies

TABARD
No one really knows

Hugo has been studying the old photographs and
Daguerreotypes Something special strikes him about them

HUGO
Look how happy he is

Indeed the joy and passion on Young Georges’ face is a
marked difference to the moody old man we know

Isabelle turns to Tabard with a smile
ISABELLE
Professor Tabard Would you like

to meet him

TABARD
Oh but you see I have met him

He smiles The color fades as we go into Tabard’s memory
As with Hugo’s flashback earlier this has the quality of a
SILENT FILM The flickering glowing luminescence of early
movies

EXT FLASHBACK -- GREENHOUSE STUDIO - DAY

In the country outside Paris

YOUNG TABARD is with his Brother Young Tabard around ten
is staring at something awed at what he is seeing

TABARD (VO)
My brother worked as a carpenter
building sets for Melies One day
he took me to visit the studio

We see what Young Tabard has been gazing at

George Melies’ film studio

The studio is an absolutely astounding sight A great
greenhouse-like collection of glass rooms A soaring castle
of glass

TABARD (VO)
It was like something out of a
dream The whole building was made
of glass In reality this was to
let in all the sunlight necessary
for filming but to my eyes it was
nothing short of an enchanted
castle a palace made of
glass

Young Tabard and his Brother go into the studio

INT FLASHBACK -- GREENHOUSE STUDIO - DAY
A dragon

A great mechanical puppet writhing and attacking jaws
snapping articulated by puppeteers They’re trying to get it
to work for the shot a battle with some knights

Young Tabard is engulfed in the filming of one of Georges’
movies It’s a joyous chaos of wildly dressed performers
fantastic sets explosive special effects technicians
filmmakers

In the background we see flats and set pieces from other
Melies movies moons suns monsters great fish castles

And at the camera his back to us is YOUNG GEORGES
himself Lining up the shot Fiddling with the camera

Young Tabard sits quietly in a corner and watches as the
technicians try to get the dragon to work properly

Young Georges finally turns from the camera and we see his
face Vital Alive Happy A marvelous twinkle in his
eye

He glances over to Young Tabard Sees the enchanted look in
the boy’s eyes Smiles

YOUNG GEORGES
If you’ve ever wondered where your
dreams come from just look around
This is where they’re made

A technician calls to Young Georges

TECHNICIAN
Think we got it
YOUNG GEORGES
(calls back)
Very good But we need to change
the scene
He glances back to Young Tabard
YOUNG GEORGES
We need to add one more
knight

Later

Young Tabard is now costumed as a knight bravely fighting
the mechanical dragon alongside other actors

He is having the time of his life

He will never forget this moment

Young Georges watches from the camera Pleased

Georges looks into the camera

Then we go into the camera we see the film zipping
through the camera the image of the dragon battle being
recorded then the film being processed an emulsion

bath the film being dried finally the film running
through a movie projector

And the completed movie glowing from a screen

Young Tabard sits in a theatre watching as the dragon battle
is projected

His face Amazed Delighted

We leave the past as color returns and we are again at

INT FILM ACADEMY -- TABARD’S OFFICE - DAY

TABARD
In the end he made over 500 movies
He was phenomenally popular in
his day

ISABELLE
But why did he stop

TABARD
Up until today I believed that he
died in the war like so many
others

HUGO
Can we watch some of his movies

TABARD
I wish you could But time
hasn’t been kind to old movies

He goes to his desk Unlocks a drawer Reverently removes a
cannister of film

TABARD
This is the only one that we know
of that survived Out of
hundreds One

Tabard is moved looking at the single sad cannister of film
He looks up at them

TABARD
And still it is a masterpiece

INT TRAIN STATION -- HANGING CLOCK - AFTERNOON

Isabelle is accompanying Hugo on his rounds as he winds the
clocks

They climb down the long ladder into the large clock
suspended from the ceiling of the Grand Hall He has his
bucket of tools

Clock dials surround him on all four sides

HUGO
I think it’s the only way
He’1l be excited Why wouldn’t he
be

He checks his pocket watch then uses a little screwdriver to
tinker with one of the clocks

Isabelle stays above on the ladder pokes her head down
ISABELLE

Do you think I should tell Mama
Jeanne
HUGO
No it has to be a surprise like a
Magic trick We have to have some
» Panache

ISABELLE
(impressed with the word)
Well done
Just then--
Through one of the clock faces--
Hugo sees the Station Inspector and Maximilian
Approaching Stopping
Standing directly below the clock

Hugo urgently gestures up to her to be quiet

HUGO
Shhh

He points down

She sees the Station Inspector
A long beat

Hugo doesn’t dare breathe

The Station Inspector stands there looking over the
terminal Then he starts to go

Hugo exhales Safe

But

Then

The clock ticks over to 400 pm

The minute hand clicks straight up
Knocking Hugo’s little screwdriver away
It falls

Hugo grabs for it

Isabelle watches in horror

Hugo misses

The screwdriver falls
It hits the bottom of the clock with a resounding
CLINK
The Station Inspector stops
Turns Looks up
STATION INSPECTOR
Monsieur Claude Are you up there
- Monsieur Claude
Hugo looks up to Isabelle in panic
What should he do
She mimes grabbing her throat act like you have laryngitis
Hugo puts on a deep scratchy voice
HUGO
(deep voice)
Monsieur

STATION INSPECTOR
Is all well up there

HUGO
(deep voice)
Yes sir

STATION INSPECTOR
Youre not inebriated are you

HUGO
(deep voice)
No sir I have a sore throat

STATION INSPECTOR
Hmm Well be sure to check the
clock on platform seven By my
calculation it is three minutes
fast I will not have time
running amok in my station

HUGO
(deep voice)
Right away sir

The Station Inspector goes Maximilian gives a nasty glance
back but follows

Hugo looks up at Isabelle

That was close

INT TRAIN STATION -- PLATFORM CLOCK - AFTERNOON
A clock over platform seven

Hugo kneels to wind the clock which is at foot level
Isabelle sits next to him

HUGO
- It’s the only way we’ll find
out everything Papa Georges

will see that there are people who
remember him How can that be
wrong

ISABELLE
(hesitant)
I don’t know

HUGO
Please Isabelle My father the
Automaton Papa Georges it’s like

a puzzle When we put it all
together something’s going to
happen

ISABELLE

A message from your father
He doesn’t look at her

HUGO
Maybe

ISABELLE
I just hope you won’t be
disappointed

A beat as he works on the clock
Through the clock face she notices Monsieur Rouleau putting
away his brushes for the day His Surrealist painting is

coming along well

She sees a passing WEALTHY COUPLE commenting unfavorably on
his painting Monsieur Rouleau ignores them with dignity

ISABELLE
Poor Monsieur Rouleau He works
so hard People just don’t

understand
HUGO
He keeps at it though He’s got a
real purpose
ISABELLE
What do you mean
HUGO
(points)

Could you hand me that
She hands him a tool from the bucket

She flops over on her back looking up at him as he continues
to work on the clock

HUGO
I mean Did you ever notice that
all machines are made for some
reason They make you laugh like
Papa Georges’ toys or they tell
time like the clocks Maybe
that’s why broken machines always
make me sad because they can’t do
what they’re meant to do

She looks up at him From her perspective he is beautifully
framed by the intricate clockwork

HUGO
Maybe it’s the same with people If
you lose your purpose it’s like
youre broken

ISABELLE
Like Papa Georges

HUGO
Maybe we can fix him

He continues to work on the clock
A beat as she watches him

ISABELLE
Is that your purpose

HUGO
What

ISABELLE
That Fixing things

HUGO
I don’t know It’s what my father
did

ISABELLE

I wonder what my purpose is

HUGO
I don’t know

A long beat as she thinks about it
It seems to make her sad

ISABELLE
Maybe if I had known my parents I
would know

She gazes out over the terminal a little lost
He looks at her Senses her sadness
A beat

HUGO
Come with me

INT TRAIN STATION -- CLOCK TOWER - EVENING
The enormous clock
The majestic view of Paris

The lights of the city are twinkling on It is magical The
whole city seems to move and flow like an elegant perfect
machine

Hugo and Isabelle look over the city

HUGO
Right after my father died I would
come up here a lot I would
imagine that the whole world was
one big machine Machines never
have any extra parts you know
They always have the exact number
they need So I figured if the
entire world was a big machine I
couldn’t be an extra part I had to

be here for some reason
(MORE )

HUGO (CONTD)
And that means you have to be here
for some reason too
She is touched

Paris sparkles below Like it is made of stars

The only sound is the steady rhythmic pulse of the clock’s
machinery

She gently takes his hand

A huge full moon is rising

They are silhouetted before the glowing moon

And above them the solar system is spinning away in perfect
order The spheres in harmony Like a great clockwork
mechanism

INT TRAIN STATION -- TOY BOOTH - EVENING

Georges is closing up the shop His movement are slow and
leaden

Hugo and Isabelle are hiding around a corner
HUGO
Ill bring them at seven o’clock

tomorrow night Don’t say anything

ISABELLE
Are you sure about this

HUGO
Not really But I think it’s the
only way

ISABELLE
To fix him

He nods

A beat

She impulsively gives him a quick kiss on the cheek
He is shocked

Then she runs to Georges at the Toy Booth

Hugo slips away

INT TRAIN STATION -- TUNNELS - EVENING
Hugo watches from behind a clock face

He sees Georges and Isabelle leaving the station

INT TRAIN STATION -- SECRET APARTMENT - NIGHT
Candles are burning

Hugo is getting ready for bed Carefully winding his big
pocket watch Hanging it on its special hook by the bed

He looks at the Automaton
The Automaton looks back at him

Hugo blows out the candles and settles into bed

He is nervous about tomorrow
Can’t sleep
The Automaton watches him

We hear the steady tick tick tick of Hugo’s pocket
watch

The image melts to

INTEXT SURREALIST NIGHTMARE - DAYNIGHT
ee tick tick tick
We are inside Monsieur Rouleau’s Surrealist painting

There is nothing vague or fuzzy about this nightmare It has
the crystal-clear clarity of Magritte The crisp bold colors
of Michael Powell

Hugo moves through the station tunnels but they are
distorted and endless An insane maze with insane angles and
impossible perspectives

As Hugo weaves through the maze he sees some familiar
faces

Down one tunnel Madame Emilie’s little dachshund runs
past in the foreground as Monsieur Labisse moves past in
the background reading aloud

Down another tunnel Monsieur Frick dances past with
Madame Emilie on the ceiling while below Monsieur Rouleau

paints blazing animated flames on the wall

They are all trapped in this endless labyrinth of tunnels

Then Isabelle appears to offer guidance

Hugo smiles goes to her

She offers her hand

He takes it

He looks up at her face

But it is not her

It is Georges Ferocious and angry

Then--

Hugo is suddenly alone Back in his apartment
He sits up on the edge of his bed

The nightmare is over

Tick tick tick

He hears the comforting sound of his pocket watch
But something is wrong

He glances over The pocket watch isn’t hanging from
anymore

He listens intently

Tick tick tick

The sounds appears to be coming from

From him

He pulls his shirt aside to reveal--

His guts are a ticking spinning clockwork--
He bolts up--

He is a machine

An Automaton

its hook

And the apartment around him is now an ENORMOUS MACHINE Loud
and horrible He is utterly surrounded POUNDING pistons
GRINDING gears SPINNING wheels

Then Hugo’s face--

Starts to melt away--

Beginning to be replaced by the impassive features of the
Automaton--

INT TRAIN STATION -- SECRET APARTMENT - NIGHT

--Hugo jerks awake

Panting for air

He gets out of bed Lights a candle

Sits

He won’t sleep anymore tonight

EXT HOUSEBOAT -- SEINE - MORNING

Two young BOHEMIANS living on a dilapidated houseboat on the
Seine

The Young Man writes a poem mouthing the lines to himself
The Young Woman lazily dangles a fishing line into the river
and smokes a pipe Very Gertrude Stein

Her lines catches Ah breakfast

She reels her catch in it’s heavy she lazily peeks
over the side of the boat and sees

Uncle Claude
His lifeless face staring up

She screams People on the banks come running

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Hugo waits nervously outside Georges’ building He checks his
big pocket watch It is just after 700

Professor Tabard approaches He carries something in a large
wooden box

TABARD
Good evening

HUGO
This way sir

He leads Tabard into the building

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT
Isabelle is pretending to read

Mama Jeanne is across the room sewing Georges is nowhere to
be seen

There is a knock at the door
Isabelle gives a little yelp and jumps up

ISABELLE
Ill get it

Jeanne removes her heavy glasses curious as Isabelle
hurries to the door and opens it

ISABELLE
Oh what a surprise Come in come
in

Hugo and Tabard enter

MAMA JEANNE
What is the meaning of this
Isabelle

ISABELLE
Please don’t be mad

MAMA JEANNE
That young man is not welcome here

HUGO
We found out who Papa Georges is

A beat as she stares at them
The imposing Rene Tabard steps forward polite and formal

TABARD
I deeply apologize Madame I
thought you were expecting us I
will leave immediately and return
upon your request
She looks

MAMA JEANNE
Please keep your voices down my
husband is sleeping He hasn’t been
well I I’m afraid you will
not be invited back

ISABELLE
Don’t make them leave

TABARD
I don’t want to impose on you
Madame Melies but if this is to be
the only time we meet please let
me express to you the profound debt
of gratitude I owe your husband

at him

TABARD
When I was boy I saw all his films
They inspired me Your husband
is a very great artist

She is touched

MAMA JEANNE
I’m pleased that you remember my
husband’s films with such fondness
but he’s become so fragile It
only hurts him to remember the
past

TABARD
(bows )
Then we will take our leave Madame
- And I do hope you’1ll forgive me
for saying you are as lovely now
as you were in the movies

Hugo and Isabelle are stunned

ISABELLE
Mama Jeanne

HUGO
You were in the movies

TABARD
She appeared in almost all of his
films

ISABELLE

You were an actress

MAMA JEANNE
That was a long time ago children
Another life I was another
person

TABARD
Would you like to meet her again

Mama Jeanne looks at him curious

TABARD
We have a film

MAMA JEANNE
One of Georges’ films But
that’s not possible They’re all
gone

TABARD
May we show you

Hugo and Isabelle implore Mama Jeanne

HUGO
Oh please

ISABELLE
Please Mama Jeanne

Mama Jeanne glances quickly to the closed bedroom door

MAMA JEANNE
Be quick with it

Rene Tabard opens the wooden box It contains a portable

movie projector He sets it up plugs it in and threads a
film as

ISABELLE
An actress A cinema actress It’s
impossibly romantic

MAMA JEANNE
It wasn’t like that We weren’t
movie stars like they have now
(a certain twinkle in her
eye)
But we did have fun

Tabard has finished The projector is ready to go Facing a
blank wall

TABARD
Madame Melies

She nods

Tabard turns on the projector
Flickering white light

A TRIP TO THE MOON

We see selections from the fantastical Georges Melies film
giving us a sense of this delightful movie

For Mama Jeanne the emotion is overwhelming Like seeing the
past come to life Her eyes fill with tears

The wizard-like Astronomers argue in the great hall

The rocket is constructed in a busy workshop The huge cannon
is tested Then it is time for the rocket to be launched

Pretty girls line up and usher the five voyagers into the
rocket

During this sequence one particular girl is featured
She is in the foreground Lovely

ISABELLE
Mama Jeanne it’s you

MAMA JEANNE
Yes

The great cannon is fired

Then the famous sequence We zoom toward the moon The face
of the man in the moon appears The rocket hits him in the
right eye He reacts

Once we reach the moon the movie is in color Lovely and
diffused Pale pastels

HUGO
It’s color

MAMA JEANNE
We tinted the film Painted it
by hand

The voyagers move around the lunar surface The earth rises
over the horizon Fantasy images of comets shooting past
stars planets constellations Then it snows and the
voyagers go into a crater

Inside the moon a weird landscape Bizarre Moon Creatures
appear The voyagers battle them The Moon Creatures
disappear magically in puffs of smoke

The voyagers escape into the rocket It is pulled off the
edge of the moon

The rocket soars back to earth It splashes into the ocean
and goes underwater An enchanting bottom-of-the-sea setting

The rocket is finally towed back to shore
The movie ends

The film tail flips around

The white light flickers

A beat

Mama Jeanne is drying her eyes

Isabelle takes her hand

ISABELLE
You were so beautiful

A voice from behind them

GEORGES (0S)
She still is

They turn
Georges is standing in the doorway He has seen it all
GEORGES
I would recognize the sound of a
movie projector anywhere
Mama Jeanne goes to him and holds him closely
She helps him to sit
He is emotionally drained
She looks at Georges deeply
MAMA JEANNE
Georges You’ve tried to forget
the past for so long and that’s

brought you nothing but unhappiness
Maybe it’s time to remember

She takes his hands in hers
MAMA JEANNE
I remember the man I fell in love
with I don’t want to lose him
forever
A long moment between them

Georges kisses her hands

He turns studies Hugo

GEORGES
You want to know
HUGO
Yes
A beat
So be it
GEORGES
Like you I loved to fix
things

The color drains from the scene as Georges remembers

INT FLASHBACK -- MAGIC THEATRE - NIGHT

Like the flashbacks earlier Georges’ story has the quality
of a SILENT FILM

Flickering gaslight We see YOUNG GEORGES on stage YOUNG
JEANNE is his assistant They do a magic trick

GEORGES (VO)
I started out as a magician and
Mama Jeanne was my assistant We
were very successful I must say
We even had our own theatre

INT FLASHBACK -- THEATREBACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Young Georges is tinkering with something mechanical we don’t
see

GEORGES (V0)
But I was always tinkering with
machines
(MORE)

GEORGES (VO) (CONTD)
I had my own workshop at the
theatre where I could invent new
illusions Once I even built a
working Automaton Ah he was a
particular treasure I put my heart
and soul into him

We see that Young Georges has been working on the
Automaton

EXT FLASHBACK -- CIRCUS GROUNDS - NIGHT

Young Georges and Young Jeanne enjoy a night at a traveling
circus They move past sideshow tents

GEORGES (V0)
Then one night Mama Jeanne and I
went to visit a traveling circus
We were walking past the sideshow
tents when I noticed something
Something strange Something
wonderful

In the distance Young Georges sees bright light flickering
magically from one of the sideshow tents The light draws him
like a moth to a flame

INT FLASHBACK -- SIDESHOW TENT - NIGHT

Young Georges and Young Jeanne are in the sideshow tent
Watching a very early movie Both are transported

GEORGES (V0O)
The Lumiere brothers had invented
the movies I fell in love with
their invention How could I not be
a part of it It was like a new
kind of magic

INT FLASHBACK -- THEATREBACKSTAGE - DAY

Young Georges uses spare pieces from the Automaton to make a
movie camera It is a beautiful and elaborate creation

GEORGES (VO)
I asked the Lumiere brothers to
sell me a camera but they refused
You see they were convinced the
movies were only a passing fad and
didn’t want me to waste my money

(MORE)

GEORGES (VO) (CONTD)
So I built my own camera using
leftover pieces from the
Automaton

EXT FLASHBACK -- GREENHOUSE STUDIO - DAY

In the country outside Paris Young Georges and Young Jeanne
pose proudly in front of their new studio as a photographer
exposes a picture

GEORGES (V0O)
We risked everything We sold
the theatre and everything we had
so we could build our own movie
studio

INT FLASHBACK -- GREENHOUSE STUDIO - DAY
Filming one of Georges’ movies

He’s a bundle of energy Currently perfecting a special
pyrotechnic effect scene with himself as the star

Young Jeanne tries to keep order in the chaotic studio

GEORGES (V0)
And so the great adventure began I
wrote designed directed and acted
in hundreds of movies Magic tricks
and illusion became my specialty
the world of imagination

Georges does a simple special effect he poses a puff of
smoke in front of him the camera stops he leaves the set
the camera starts a disappearing man

Young Jeanne laughs and helps clean the black powder off his
face

GEORGES (VO)
My beautiful wife was my muse my
star and we couldn’t have been
happier We thought it would
never end How could it

Suddenly--

More pyrotechnics -- but different now -- the EXPLOSION OF
BOMBS -- flashes of light -- trenches and barbed wire -- the
horrible rattle of machine guns -- iconic images of the First

World War--

Taking us to

EXT FLASHBACK -- STREET - DAY

Rain Sodden flags Georges older now watches a line of
French soldiers march off to war Like tragic toy soldiers

GEORGES (V0)

But then the war came and youth
and hope were at an end The
world had no time for magic tricks
and movie shows

INT FLASHBACK -- MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

Georges stands at the rear of a theatre One of his fanciful
movies is playing Many veteran soldiers are in the audience
Smoking Making out with girlfriends Bored

GEORGES (V0)

The returning soldiers having seen
so much of reality were bored by
my films Tastes had changed
but I had not changed with them

INTEXT FLASHBACK -- GREENHOUSE STUDIO - DAYNIGHT

TIME LAPSE the beautiful greenhouse studio decays the
windows crack and break weeds spring up the gorgeous
set pieces rot the roof falls rain splashes in

the studio is boarded up and abandoned

GEORGES (VO)

No one wanted my movies anymore
Eventually I couldn’t pay the
actors or keep the business running
-- And so my enchanted castle fell
to ruin Everything was lost

EXT FLASHBACK -- GREENHOUSE STUDIO - NIGHT
Georges stands in the ruins of his studio

A great bonfire is roaring We see a huge painted version of
the famous moon face from A TRIP TO THE MOON burning

Georges in anguish is tossing costumes into the pyre

GEORGES (V0)

One night in bitter despair I
burned all my old sets and costumes
- I was forced to sell my movies
to a company that melted them down
into chemicals used to make shoe
heels

A sudden flare from the bonfire--
Transforms to--

A reel of old movie film -- bursting into flames blazing --
then melting--

The liquid is poured into a mold -- a shoe heel emerges from
the mold -- it is nailed onto a shoe--

The shoe walks past the Toy Booth in the Train Station

INT FLASHBACK - TRAIN STATION -- TOY BOOTH - DAY

Georges is in the Toy Booth It looks much the same only
newer It is like a prison

GEORGES (VO)

With the little money I made from
selling my films I bought the toy
booth And there I have
remained

Georges sits at the counter

He stares out Lost Dead-eyed

The color gradually returns

And Georges’ face ages to now

As we return to

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT
- Georges’s face
He concludes the story

GEORGES
The only thing I couldn’t bring
myself to destroy was my beloved
Automaton I gave him to a museum

hoping he would find a home
(MORE )

GEORGES (CONTD)
But they never put him on display
And then the museum burned It’s
all gone now Everything I ever
made Nothing but ashes and
fading strips of celluloid

He looks at Hugo deeply
Proceeds with difficulty

GEORGES
My life has taught me one lesson
Hugo Not the one I thought it
would Happy endings only happen
in the movies

HUGO
The story’s not over yet

He stands Excited

HUGO
Ill be right back

He shares a secret look with Isabelle and then runs out

Georges is mystified

EXT STREETS - NIGHT

Hugo races through the streets

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - NIGHT
Meanwhile the train station is bustling

Monsieur Frick is walking through the Grand Hall He carries
a large picnic basket and has a rather crafty expression

He approaches Madame Emilie’s cafe

Madame Emilie is pleased to see him Her dachshund is not It
begins to growl menacingly

This time however Monsieur Frick is not deterred
He approaches bravely
The dachshund growls more About to attack

Then

Monsieur Frick reaches into the picnic basket
And removes

Another little dachshund

With a pink ribbon around its neck

Madame Emilie’s dachshund is instantly smitten The two dogs
nuzzle affectionately

Monsieur Frick the conquering hero steps forward boldly
takes Madame Emilie’s hand and kisses it She blushes

Just then Hugo appears

He is moving quickly toward one of the air vents past the
cafe

But he ducks to the side when the Station Inspector and
Maximilian approach the cafe Lisette wanders over from
the flower stall to join them

Hugo hidden nearby overhears

STATION INSPECTOR
There has been a disquieting
development

MONSIEUR FRICK
What is it

STATION INSPECTOR
The man who winds the clocks
Monsieur Claude has been found --
deceased

Lisette gasps
Hugo stiffens listens intently
STATION INSPECTOR
They found his body in the Seine
He’s been down there for months it
seems Amongst the fishes And

such

MADAME EMILIE
Oh dear oh dear

Meanwhile the two dachshunds are sniffing around

They wander over to where Hugo is hiding He tries
desperately to shoo them away

Maximilian notices the dachshunds He pulls at his leash to
investigate The Station Inspector restrains him

STATION INSPECTOR
I can’t say I’m surprised this was
his mortal culmination He was an
inebriant of the highest order
Time and again I had to warn him
about it These are the wages of
sin

MONSIEUR FRICK
But if Monsieur Claude has been
dead for months

STATION INSPECTOR
Yes

MONSIEUR FRICK
At the bottom of the river

MADAME EMILIE
Yes

MONSIEUR FRICK
Then who has been winding the
clocks
Just then -- the dachshunds begin BARKING like crazy at Hugo--
Maximilian pulls free--
The Station Inspector sees Hugo--

Hugo bolts but not fast enough--

Maximilian bounds -- leaps in front of him -- snarling
ferociously--

Hugo freezes terrified--
The Station Inspector grabs him

Captured At last

INT TRAIN STATION -- CORRIDORINSPECTOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

The Station Inspector drags Hugo through the corridorstairs
and into his office

HUGO
You don’t understand -- I have to

go

STATION INSPECTOR
Youll go nowhere until your
parents can be found

HUGO
I don’t have any parents

STATION INSPECTOR
Then it’1l be straight to the
orphanage with you little vermin

He flings Hugo into the dreadful little cell and slams the
door shut with a resounding clang Hugo clings to the bars

STATION INSPECTOR
You and your kind Spreading
disorder everywhere you go WELL
NOT HERE THIS IS MY STATION DO
YOU UNDERSTAND -- AND I WILL HAVE
ORDER

The Station Inspector’s fury echoes around the office He
turns away to his desk

Hugo quickly pulls out the lock-picking tool he used
before

The Stations Inspector picks up the phone taps the cradle
for a connection

STATION INSPECTOR
Yes hello hello Connect me
with the Orphanage Bureau Quickly
I need to arrange a
He glances back to Hugo--

The cell door is open Hugo is gone

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - NIGHT

Hugo clatters down the stairs outside the Station Inspector’s

office--

The Station Inspector appears and follows remarkably agile
down the stairs using the handrails to swing--

STATION INSPECTOR
(calls)
Maximilian

Hugo reaches the floor of the terminal--

Fe FF

Maximilian who is with the two dachshunds bolts after him—-
The dachshunds takes off as well--
Hugo weaves wildly through the terminal

But the Station Inspector is gaining spidering quickly after
him his leg brace squeaking

The dachshunds race along Barking madly Maximilian
following

Hugo cuts a path through a crowd of commuters
The Station Inspector nears a step or two away--
He reaches for Hugo--

But Hugo has unexpected allies

Monsieur Labisse “accidentally” steps in front of the Station
Inspector stopping him--

MONSIEUR LABISSE
Oh do pardon me

Hugo speeds away
Shoots Monsieur Labisse a thankful glance
The Station Inspector rights himself and races after Hugo

Maximilian and the yapping dachshunds follow close at Hugo’s
heels

But Hugo has another unexpected ally

Monsieur Rouleau munching on a baguette as he walks through
the station sees the situation--

He tosses his baguette like a bowler--
It slides across the floor--
Hugo leaps over it--

The dachshunds being dachshunds instantly veer off
pursuing the food--

Hugo’s free of them He disappears around a corner

INT TRAIN STATION -- CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

The Station Inspector and Maximilian round the corner after
Hugo--

But Hugo has disappeared

Then the Station Inspector notices a manhole cover in the
floor is slightly ajar

INT TRAIN STATION -- TURNTABLE - NIGHT

Hugo is swiftly climbing down a ladder He jumps down to a
large mechanized turntable where entire streetcars and metro
trains pull in and are rotated to face different tunnels

Tunnels shoot off in six directions

Hugo hears the Station Inspector clattering and squeaking
down the ladder after him

Hugo looks around Sees an access panel leading down under
the turntable into the workings of the machine

He climbs through the access panel and disappears just as the
Station Inspector spiders down the ladder after him

Beneath Hugo is surrounded by the great gears and cogs of
the turntable mechanism huge wheels and springs and pistons
like a gigantic clock He can see the Station Inspector right
above Looking for him

Incredible suspense as the Station Inspector searches

Hugo is silent Artfully slipping between the mammoth
gears as the Station Inspector looks down through open slats
in the floor hunting for him

The Station Inspector peers down Hugo silently crawls
between great cogs to stay hidden The Station Inspector
doesn’t see him

But then -- the Station Inspector sees that a train is coming
into the turntable

He quickly moves to the ladder and climbs out
But Hugo can’t He’s trapped
The train or streetcar rumbles in right above him Hugo

covers his ears at the seismic roar Ashes and sparks rain
down The train stops

Hugo waits

Then

The turntable starts to move

The great gears turn the pistons stab the cogs grind
- Hugo dives to avoid the pistons slithers between the
cogs and gears that engulf him like teeth trying to devour
him--

It’s like Chaplin in MODERN TIMES Hugo’s is trapped inside a
huge machine as it grinds and pounds and turns -- threatening

to crush him from every side

He slips slides jumps and maneuvers Just managing to avoid
being crushed

Then it’s over The turntable stops The train rumbles off
down a different tunnel

Hugo finally dares to peek through the access panel No sign
of the Station Inspector He climbs up

INT TRAIN STATION -- TUNNELS - NIGHT

Hugo moves through the tunnels

Then he hears a sound echoing ominously a low growl
Maximilian No idea where it’s coming from

Hugo stops Looks
The growl is closer now But from where
Hugo looks around in desperation Tunnels in every direction

Hugo is by the long stairway leading up to the tower He
decides to escape that way He disappears up the stairway

Just as the Station Inspector and Maximilian round a corner
They stop Look in various directions Which way did he go

Maximilian sniffs He indicates the steps up

INT TRAIN STATION -- TOWER STAIRS - NIGHT
Hugo’s feet pound His legs pump He pants for air

Climbing climbing climbing

The long stairway seems to stretch out wildly below Like
VERTIGO
The Station Inspector and Maximilian pursue Churning up the
long stairway below Hugo
INTEXT TRAIN STATION -- CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT
Hugo emerges at the very top of the station
He looks around in panic
He hears the Station Inspector and Maximilian coming up the
stairs Huffing and puffing Feet pounding Nails clicking
Leg brace squeaking Closer and closer
Hugo’s trapped
Or is he
He takes a deep breath

Then

He climbs through the enormous clock face

Until he is clinging to the outside of the clock
A deadly drop below

Just like Harold Lloyd in SAFETY LAST

Inside the Station Inspector and Maximilian appear
The Station Inspector Looks around Puzzled
Maximilian sniffs Confused

Then outside

The enormous hour hand that Hugo is clinging to
Lurches

Almost breaks

Hugo clings to it desperately echoing the iconic image from
SAFETY LAST

The abyss below is terrifying

Hugo doesn’t dare cry out
Inside the Station Inspector grunts

STATION INSPECTOR
Must have gone the other way Come

He leads Maximilian back down the stairs

Outside Hugo carefully pulls himself to safety He sits ona
ledge for a moment Getting his breath

He looks over Paris
Shakes his head
What a night

He climbs back through the clock

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - NIGHT

Hugo is lugging the Automaton wrapped in a blanket through
the terminal

It is slow going but he does his best

He keeps a wary eye out for the Station Inspector and
Maximilian

He sees the two villainous dachshunds at the cafe

He chooses to avoid them

Goes in another direction

INT TRAIN STATION -- PLATFORM - NIGHT
Hugo moves along a platform
A train has just arrived

Scores of commuters are climbing off the train and scurrying
along the platform

They jostle Hugo
He continues on
Then

Behind him

We see
A bottle-green coat

The Station Inspector
Following

Oddly no sign of Maximilian

Hugo shifts the heavy Automaton trying to make it easier to
carry as he pushes through the crowd

The Station Inspector nears
Hugo doesn’t see him
The Station Inspector reaches out for Hugo

But then Hugo sees the Station Inspector’s image reflected
in a window of the train

Hugo cleverly nips into the train--

INT TRAIN STATION-TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
Hugo pushes through the crowd of people inside the train--
The Station Inspector pursues calling

STATION INSPECTOR
Stand aside

Hugo nips out the other side of the train--

INT TRAIN STATION -- PLATFORM - NIGHT
He emerges to the platform--

Where--

Maximilian is waiting

Hugo lurches to a stop--

The Station Inspector lunges from the train grabbing Hugo’s
arm--

Swinging him around--
Hugo loses his grip--

The Automaton flies from Hugo’s arms
Time slows as
The beautiful machine falls through the air
Tumbling end-over-end

Falling slowly toward the empty train tracks of the next
platform over

Finally

Crashing down

And there’s a train coming along these tracks--
Barreling out of the station--

Picking up speed--

Hugo doesn’t hesitate--

He jerks his arm free--

Jumps down--

Onto the tracks

The train is nearing Coming straight at Hugo Just like the
early movie we saw before A TRAIN ARRIVES IN THE STATION

The train gets bigger and bigger as it approaches
Hugo grabs the Automaton
The train’s whistle howls Someone screams

A hand reaches down for Hugo

The train Closer and closer
The metallic screech of the train’s brakes

Hugo thrusts his hand up

The Station Inspector clasps his hand

At the last possible moment Hugo is yanked off the tracks to
safety He still clings to the Automaton

A shower of sparks from the train’s wheels as it passes

Hugo and the Automaton fall awkwardly to the platform

The Station Inspector and the crowd are stunned They press
in Questioning Scolding Poking Talking

Hugo only cares about the Automaton It is broken and
battered Hugo pulls it to him Clings to it desperately

STATION INSPECTOR
You demented animal What were you
thinking

Before Hugo can respond the Station Inspector hauls him away -
- stomping off cutting through the crowd -- dragging Hugo --
Hugo still clinging to the Automaton--

INT TRAIN STATION -- GRAND HALL - NIGHT

They move through the busy Grand Hall Hugo struggles to free
himself from the Station Inspector

STATION INSPECTOR
Well let the orphanage deal with
you

HUGO
No -- I don’t belong there

STATION INSPECTOR
Where do you belong then A child
has to belong to somewhere and to
someone

Hugo finally wrenches himself free Holds the Automaton to
his chest

His emotion is overwhelming Tears choking him
HUGO
Please Please listen to me
You have to let me go I don’t
understand why my father died
- why I’m alone

He clings to the Automaton

HUGO
This is my only chance To work

He glances at the Station Inspector’s leg brace

HUGO
You should understand

By now a little crowd has formed around them Monsieur
Frick Madame Emile Lisette
And two new arrivals
Georges and Isabelle Georges has heard everything

GEORGES
I do I do understand

He looks at the Station Inspector
GEORGES
Monsieur This child belongs to
me

The Station Inspector looks at him

And then the Station Inspector smiles A kind and effortless
smile

He releases Hugo
Hugo crosses to Georges and Isabelle

He still holds the Automaton to him closely

HUGO

I’m sorry He’s broken
GEORGES

No he’s not He worked

perfectly
He embraces Hugo
And then we see them from high above
Hugo Georges Isabelle the Automaton

The train station swirling around them Passengers moving
to and fro

Like the gears and wheels of a clock
A precise beautiful machine

Then we iris down to black

A title appears

SIX MONTHS LATER

We iris back up again to

The famous man in the moon face from A TRIP TO THE MOON

INT FILM ACADEMY - THEATRE - NIGHT

- Which is painted on the curtain of the impressive Film
Academy theatre

The theatre is filled with elegant guests A buzzing crowd A
gala event

Hugo Isabelle and Mama Jeanne sit together

Hugo has had a haircut His new short hair is combed neatly
into place He is wearing a tuxedo Very handsome

He looks almost grown up

Isabelle next to him is bewitching in a formal dress
The lights dim

Rene Tabard steps to the stage in front of the curtain

TABARD
Honored guests I am proud to
welcome you to this gala
celebrating the life and work of
Georges Melies

Applause
Mama Jeanne begins to cry Isabelle takes her hand

TABARD
For years most of his films were
thought to be lost Indeed
Monsieur Melies believed so
himself But we began a search We
looked through vaults and long-
forgotten archives through private
collections barns and catacombs
Our work was rewarded with old
negatives boxes of prints and
trunks full of decaying film which
we were able to save We now
have over eighty films by Georges
Melies

Applause
TABARD

And tonight their creator and

the newest member of the Film

Academy faculty is here to

share them with you
He turns and bows
The magnificent man-in-the-moon curtain parts to reveal
Georges

Standing center stage A movie screen behind him

His hair and beard have been neatly trimmed He wears an
elegant tuxedo and looks extremely distinguished

The audience erupts in cheers and applause
Finally they are quiet
GEORGES
Ladies and gentlemen I am
standing before you tonight because
of one very brave young man
He finds Hugo’s face in the crowd
GEORGES
He saw a broken machine And
against all odds he fixed it
It was the kindest magic trick I
have ever seen
Hugo is moved
Isabelle looks at him proud
GEORGES
Now my friends I address you all
tonight as you truly are wizards
mermaids travelers adventurers
and magicians Come and dream
with me
He turns toward the movie screen
The lights dim

A flickering projector’s light shines

And we enter the joyous world of Georges Melies
It is a cornucopia of images from a golden horn A
phantasmagoria of

Undersea kingdoms

Magic tricks

Wildly dancing devils
Mysterious submarine journeys
Gigantic monsters
Beautiful damsels
Soaring palaces

Wondrous balloon voyages
Knock-about slapstick
Expanding heads
Frolicking skeletons
Lovely star-like angels
And

A trip to the moon

Hugo is barely watching the screen He is looking at
something else

Georges stands to the side of the stage watching
The glow from the screen illuminates Georges’ face
He is like a man reborn

Hugo looks at him

Smiles

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT
A party After the gala
The small apartment is crowded with well-wishers and friends

We float through the party

Georges is talking closely to Rene Tabard Film students and
other fans crowd around Georges He winks to Mama Jeanne
across the room She winks back

We continue on

Monsieur Frick and Madame Emilie sit together The dachshunds
happy on their laps

We continue on

Monsieur Rouleau talks to Monsieur Labisse about books and
art Monsieur Rouleau’s completed painting hangs on a wall

We continue on

The Station Inspector sits with Lisette and Maximilian
Actually Maximilian sits between them He’s unsure what to
make of this new-found romance

We continue on

To find

Hugo is dominating a corner of the party doing wonderful
cards tricks The crowd around him is impressed

He glances over smiles to Isabelle across the room
She smiles back
A beat as she watches him

Then we go with Isabelle as she moves to a quiet corner She
looks over the party for a moment

Then she sits and begins to write in a notebook

ISABELLE (VO)
Once upon a time I met a boy named
Hugo Cabret He lived in a train
station

We move away from Isabelle
Past Hugo
Past Georges and Mama Jeanne
ISABELLE (VO)
Why did he live in a train station
You might well ask That’s

really what this book is going to
be about
We move into Hugo’s room
The Automaton nicely repaired is watching from a corner
We go to the Automaton
ISABELLE (VO)
And about how this singular young
man searched so hard to find a
secret message from his father
The Automaton’s face
Looking through the open doorway into the party
ISABELLE (VO)
And how that message lit his way
-- all the way home

The Automaton watches Hugo

You would swear it was smiling

The End
