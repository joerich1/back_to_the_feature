As several PASSENGERS finally get the message and scoot under
the ropes an irate passenger in the bg steps out of line
and approaches the Redcoat

IRATE PASSENGER
(to Redcoat)
Excuse me Youre letting them go
but weve been standing here for
over an hour How does that happen

Lisa stares at the passenger overhearing She shakes her
head sympathizing with the poor Redcoat

gonna miss their flight

IRATE PASSENGER
So it doesnt matter that you canceled
my first flight then re-routed me

Theres something in Rippners eyes that makes the irate
passenger hesitate -- something that says theres only one

This as Rippner throws quick glances toward the seats that
might be in his line of sight But no ones looking Most
still sleeping The Headphone Kids doing homework
Rebeccas playing her gameboy

Then he notices something peculiar -- the passenger suddenly
takes the phone from his ear curiously looks at the LCD
sereen Then hangs the phone up

Rippner slowly turns his head back to Lisa

LISA (contd)
Yeah were gonna put him in 4080 --
Right

Rippners eyes focus on the LCD screen NO SERVICE
But for some reason Lisas still talking

to his ear --

Holding her breath she reaches for the cordless phone on
the table Her life might depend on her not making a sound ——
so she doesn’t even breath as she does this

ON HER FINGERS — just about to touch the phone — when it
EXPLODES in a nerve-shattering RIIIIIIIIIING Lisa grabs

the phone and hits “talk” Only listens —- not risking using
her own voice

911 OPERATOR (V0)
(phone filter as needed)
This is 9-1-1 dispatch is anyone
there

Relief washes over Lisa’s face --

LISA
(into phone whispers)
Yes --

911 OPERATOR (VO)
Ma’‘am I’m sorry it’s been so long
weve had an emergency downtown My
report reads you had someone hit in
front of your house

LISA
There’s a man in my house -- trying
to kill me

911 OPERATOR (VO)
(instantly alert)
Ma’am stay calm lock yourself ina
room someone will be right --

Lisas drops the phone streaks for the door to the hallway
Looks out quickly then grabs the door and swings it shut
Unfortunately -- this one simple act

REVEALS RIPPNER — whos gotten behind it during the moments
she wasat the bathroom door to her bedroom

She screams or we scream — not important which — as Rippner
attacks knife high There’s a brief but terrifying struggle
— he’s slashing at her feinting thrusting But she’s
also taking a toll on him — she’s damn fast with that stick
-—— she gets a couple of good ones —- even catching him on
the wrist so hard that he loses control of the knife It
flies out the door clattering to the floor

But Rippner is far from out — there’s an even more personal
struggle as she swings again Rippner sidesteps grabs out
— and suddenly has a grim hold on the stick

This happens near the doorway to the hall He spins her
around slams her against the door (now it’s back wide open
again) flings her stick away — then they grapple Both
nearly lose their balance and they reel out through the
door onto the

SECOND FLOOR LANDING - CONTINUOUS
Where Rippner SLAMS her against the wall --

But Lisa still has plenty of fight left —- she attempts a
knee to the groin her hands claw for his eyes but none of
it works Shes pinned within moments But she never takes
her eyes off him never flinches or looks scared Her face
is a study in fury and defiance

It’s overwhelmingly clear that far from being afraid of him
shes just seeing him at last for what he is

LISA
Youre pathetic

And it’s almost as if we see Rippner see himself in the mirror
of her eyes -- He sees that and he can’t bear to Look at

it In frustration Rippner tosses Lisa UP and OVER the
railing Lisa wide-eyed SCREAMS as she flips back TUMBLING
DOWN THE STAIRCASE to the first landing in the

ENTRY HALL

below Lisas barely conscious Unmoving Her eyes flutter

open catching Rippner out of focus making his way down
the stairs Lisa painfully pulls herself down the last few
steps to the entry hall floor where she suddenly spies
something

UNDERNEATH A TABLE

near the hit mans body --

Lisa slowly turns her head glances up sees

RIPPNER

on the stairs the Ka-Bar knife once again firmly in hand

She suddenly raises THE HIT MANS BERETTA -

Rippner stops Scoffs Shakes his head as the SIRENS get

closer
RIPPNER
(re approaching sirens)
Well talk again
Rippner starts to back away

LISA
-— No -- Dont move

A beat Rippner glares at Lisa Eyes her trembling hand --
trying to hold the gun steady Rippner calls her bluff

takes a step forward -

BAM Lisa FIRES Upper shoulder The impact knocks Rippner
back but he doesnt fall He charges back for Lisa and

SMACKS the gun from her hand The gun slides away

Rippner kneels down to Lisa when the COCKING OF A GUN 0S
stops him Rippner looks up Dad bloodied but conscious

and pissed as all hell has the gun trained steadily on him --

THWUMP Dad FIRES a SILENCED ROUND hitting Rippner in the
chest The impact spins him around He falls to his knees
Exhaustion setting in He slinks to the floor rolls on his

back Alive but beaten

Dad advances keeping the gun trained as he helps Lisa pull
herself up She and Dad stand over Rippner as the outside

SIRENS CLOSE IN

Off Lisa looking down at Rippner
