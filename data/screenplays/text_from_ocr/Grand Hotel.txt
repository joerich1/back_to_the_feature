then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day
jumble

CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of
steps that lead up to the restaurant In its journey

passes Kringelein looking up He is not pointed

THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile
across -- near Senfs desk Senf is very busy THE
now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf General

Senf stands before his background of slots and keys WE
PROCEED until we are facing the elevator

At that moment the elevator is opening Among the
emerge is Suzette who moves too quickly for us to
who she is
THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we
her saying to Senf
SUZETTE

Madam Grusinskaya will not want her

car
This line is only just above the general clatter of
but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-

and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND we see the boy

towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance
saying

people drinking before their lunch

We pick up the Doctor leaning his head upon his hands
looking into space The woman next to him a noisy

is laughing The doctor glances up at her -- she

the doctor She and the audience see the scarred side
face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns

her companion who is the Baron We do not get much of
chance to see him because at that instant he is

his watch his shoulders are turning away from THE

and he moves out towards the lobby

BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into
main aisle of busy room in restaurant Great activity
waiters The bustle and activity of fashionable

string orchestra is playing

Among other things we pick up the smiling face of the
Maitre dhotel he has apparently just shown someone
to a table

THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him His face
as CAMERA reaches service table The pompous Maitre
now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter

MAITRE DHOTEL

The waiter frightened and perspiring doesnt bother

argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to

a cauldron of soup

CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a
cauldron that is near the edge We see the soup fall
hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized
She has been scalded General steamy confusion The

the aisle the waiter takes it from him

THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup

As the Baron is picking up his tickets he looks around
quickly
as he hears the voice of Pimenov who has arrived

Senf is speaking to a lady at the same time

SENF
The train leaves at seven-thirty
Madam That is the only through train --
the dining car goes along

The Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little
speaks volubly to his wife
BARON

(sarcastically)
Its always so quiet here
PIMENOV
If you occupied the room next to
Madam Grusinskaya you would
appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby

BARON
My dear sir I would gladly change
rooms with you

PIMENOV

(effeminately)
No doubt you would Baron But do
you know Im quite indispensable to
her Im her ballet master and her
nurse I hardly belong to myself
anymore But there you are its
Grusinskaya -- you cant help adoring
her

At that moment Zinnowitz pushes past them

SENF
(to Clerk)

them

At that moment the Doctor enters the scene

DOCTOR

SENF
No Doctor

DOCTOR

The Doctor turns slowly away taking out a cigarette

PIMENOV
(looking up from his
letter -- glances
off at the doctor)
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You

PIMENOV
The war dropped him here and forgot
him
BARON
(beams )
Yes I was in the war
CUT IN FLASH OF DOCTOR --
He turns as he hears the Baron say this
He pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the
Baron
then he looks off at Kringelein -- who is trying to get
Rohnas attention (the reception Clerk) -- at the
reception

desk which adjoins that of Senfs
KRINGELEINS VOICE
Please -- please pay some attention
to me -- I have no time

Pan back to desk

ROHNA

and gentleman who
have just arrived)
If you will wait one moment sir

KRINGELEIN

room at all and what a room that is

ROHNA
Its a very nice room and inexpensive
sir

KRINGELEIN
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to
live in -- when I came here did I
ask for a cheap room Did I

Rohna sensing a scene with this strange dirty little
gentleman looks furtively around for the manager

ROHNA
Just one moment sir

KRINGELEIN
No I wont wait -- I cant -- Every
day is precious -- every hour --

Every minute
Second Clerk is looking straight at him

Kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and
proceeds

KRINGELEIN
I came here because I wanted to live
here two weeks maybe three -- God

As he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is

watching
Assistant Manager enters

ASSISTANT MANAGER

Rohna and Kringelein speak together

ROHNA
The gentleman is dissatisfied with
room number five fifty-nine

KRINGELEIN
I certainly have a complaint -- and

a fair one

He senses an audience and warms up The Baron and

Pimenov

enter the scene The lady and gentleman have turned
The

bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses
and

looks up

KRINGELEIN
(continuing)

I came here from a long distance to
stay at the Grand Hotel I want a
room -- a big room -- like you would
give General Director Preysing --
Im as good as Mr Preysing -- I can
pay like Mr Preysing -- would you
give him a little room way up in
the corner with the hot water pipes

with his fist)

KRINGELEIN
Oh -- but -- I --

DOCTOR

During this scene the manager has been talking with

Rohna
quietly The manager how turns

MANAGER

MANAGER

KRINGELEIN
Well now thats very kind -- thanks
Thats what I want -- a large room
on the front with a private bath --

He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to
extract

money

DOCTOR
That will not be necessary

The manager is instructing the bellboy to take
Kringelein to
the new room

Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron who
has

noticed the money stoops to pick it up

In bending himself Kringelein drops his hat
with his

suddenly

where

Baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it
sleeve

KRINGELEIN
Thank you sir

BARON

KRINGELEIN
(finding a friendly
face)
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein --

KRINGELEIN

popular

BARON

Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor --

DOCTOR

collar is an inch too big for him --
I know he is ill

KRINGELEIN
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes --

nervously to his
collar)

Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out

At that moment Pimenov returns from the news-stand
he has bought the evening papers

PIMENOV
Well Baron -- I must go and dress

KRINGELEIN
(to doctor)
Is this gentleman a Baron too

PIMENOV

(laughing)
Unfortunately no

The Manager comes into scene

MANAGER

Kringelein turns to the desk The Doctor turns up with

him
At that moment the Barons chauffeur touches his arm
CHAUFFEUR

BARON
No -- I told you not to come in this
lobby
CHAUFFEUR

THE CAMERA RUSHES UP BEHIND HER ALMOST PUSHING INTO

ELEVATOR

WITH HER

As she enters the elevator and the gate shuts she
turns

around back pressed against the Baron -- who is
looking

down at her The look on her face is the look we often
see

on Flaemmchens in elevators when they are pressed

Baron glances back up the passage it is apparent that
he is

By this time the others are entering Kringeleins room
Baron turns back for a moment
BARON
(calling back quietly
to Suzette)

Asleep -- Ssshhh -- sorry

Suzette turns back into the room

GRUSINSKAYAS ROOM
It is typical hotel Half-open trunks etc Curtains

drawn -- room is in semi-darkness There is a sense of
silence except for distant music coming from the

Room below
In Suzettes hands we see one of Grusinskayas ballet

which she has been mending

She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops

and looks off dramatically at

GRUSINSKAYA

Shot from her angle She is sleeping beneath a Chinese
on the chaise-lounge

Apparently she has changed her position because the
which is outside the robe moves

The CAMERA as though it were Suzette moves up towards
Grusinskaya Her eyes are closed Suzette crosses to

chaise-lounge and is looking down
Grusinskayas eyes open suddenly She looks at the

ceiling
and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette
SUZETTES VOICE
(quietly and reverently --
almost a whisper)
Madam has slept well
GRUSINSKAYA
No I have been awake -- thinking --
thinking
SUZETTES VOICE
It is time for the performance
GRUSINSKAYA
The performance
SUZETTE
It is time
Like a soldier called to attention Grusinskaya sits
suddenly
upright --
GRUSINSKAYA
Always the performance -- every day
the performance -- time for the
performance
(she pauses and droops
suddenly)
I think Suzette I have never been
so tired in my life
(she takes the bottle
of veronal which is
nearby)
Veronal didnt even help me to sleep
(laughs a little)
SUZETTE
(speaking into
telephone)
Madam Grusinskayas car is to be
brought
While she is speaking Grusinskaya rises -- with the
grace of

a dancer she picks up the Chinese robe that has fallen

the floor and although there is only one other woman in
room -- she holds the robe around her

She crosses to the mirror and looks at her face
fingers through her hair She gently massages under her
and the CAMERA sees Grusinskaya for the first time

There is silence in the room -- neither of the women

Suzette gets madams clothes ready She crosses puts

case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens

Grusinskaya looks into space -- silence -- dead

Suzette kneels as if to put Madams stockings on for
Grusinskaya pulls her foot away

GRUSINSKAYA
I cant dance tonight --

SUZETTE
It will pass -- it will pass -- come

GRUSINSKAYA
Let us cancel the engagement

SUZETTE
But Madam cannot do that

GRUSINSKAYA
Now is the time to cancel to stop
entirely I feel it -- everything
tells me -- enough -- enough

She leans forward against the dressing-table and her

unconsciously touch the pearls

GRUSINSKAYA
(very quietly)
The peals are cold -- everything is
cold -- finished -- it seems so far
away -- so threadbare -- the Russians --

St Petersburg -- the Imperial Court --
away

knock

the Grand Duke Sergei --

(long pause as though

she were reliving

incidents of the

past)
-- Sergei -- dead -- Grusinskaya --
its all gone

She throws the pearls away down upon the floor

SUZETTE
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they
were to break --

GRUSINSKAYA
The pearls wont break -- they hold
together and bring me bad luck ----
I hate them

Suzette crosses replacing the pearls

SUZETTE

Orchids come again Madam -- no card --
I think perhaps they are from the

same young man -- he is at the end

of the corridor -- tall -- he walks
like a soldier -- Madam must have
noticed how often he is in the

elevator with us Last night for
instance --

GRUSINSKAYA
Oh Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh --
quiet
Grusinskayas eyes are looking off into space -- she

in Russia

-- she does not look --

Telephone rings -- Suzette crosses to telephone
SUZETTE
Ah oui -- the car is here for Madam

As Pimenov is closing the door we hear Grusinskaya

into telephone

GRUSINSKAYA
(authoritatively)
Madam Grusinskaya will not require
her car -- no -- she will not be

going to the theatre
(she turns)

Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow He
deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood

She glances at him without smiling crosses to the
table and sits

PIMENOV
It is time for the performance

GRUSINSKAYA
(under her breath)
The performance -- the performance --
the performance
(during this scene
the orchids fall to
the floor)

It is a hysterical out-burst It is not a woman who is
temperamental it is something deeper than that She is
near a nervous breakdown We the audience must feel

her a revulsion against the word performance

PIMENOV
(tenderly -- as he
touches her shoulder
gently)
Poor little Lisevata -- she still
has her stage frights -- it will

pass
Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her
hands he
attempts to soothe her

Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away

GRUSINSKAYA
It is not stage fright -- its
something more --

PIMENOV
(tenderly)
What -- what is it Last night

GRUSINSKAYA
Last night There was no applause

PIMENOV
(quickly)
There was -- there was

GRUSINSKAYA

That theatre -- half empty -- dancing
for those few -- I was frantic -- I
finished -- the last beat and

(she reclines her

head as the swan

finishing the dance)
I waited -- I listened -- but the
applause didnt come -- nothing A
man in the box -- and just the claques
behind -- it is passed Pimenov We
are dead -- its finished

There is a sudden knocking at the door

PIMENOV
Meierheim --

The door opens suddenly Meierheim bursts into the
room

MEIERHEIM
What is this that you have cancelled
your car Who am I that I should
wait like a fool at the door And

SEQUENCE 2
FADE IN ON BLACKNESS OF PREYSINGS ROOM

We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of

the

typewriter rattling The reason for the blackness is
that

Preysings back is flat into the camera His hands are
behind

his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly It
is an

odd effect We dont know quite what it is

PREYSINGS VOICE
Both parties have fully agreed that
this merger can result only in mutual
advantages

Preysing moves forward showing that we are in
Preysings
room

The change of light shows us plainly the time lapse
Flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing Preying

strides
forward As he strides he says

wrist-

accidentally his arm
touches her neck)

Oh -- sorry

his mouth and walks

as

she stretches back showing her busts Seeing his face
looking

down on her she pulls herself together and seats
herself at

FLAEMMCHEN

PREYSING
Moreover
(as he paces the room
it is obvious that
he is trying to
collect his thoughts)

She looks at him waits a moment and then begins
characteristically to change the sheet of paper

FLAEMMCHEN
I dont see why its unusual for a
stenographer to be pretty -- if she
does her work well -- seems so silly
I dont know why they dont like
girls like me in offices Personally
I hate offices -- Id much rather be
in the movies

PREYSING

Quickly he hides behind the curtains

Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid tired and

At last because of the noise of the telephone she

She is in a thin robe She sits before mirror -- looks
steadily at her face Her head goes down suddenly in

hands and we hear her say

Suddenly she moves quickly across the room Goes to

Baron half starts out toward door He watches -- darts
the room as if towards the door He hears her coming

darts quickly into the half open door of the closet

She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water She
places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements
quick and furtive -- then she crosses picks up the

asks for the theatre

GRUSINSKAYA
The Western Theatre --

She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -
stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back
telephone speaks

GRUSINSKAYA
Western Theatre

She glances up at the clock

GRUSINSKAYA
The stage -- Mr Pimonov -- the ballet
master Grusinskaya -- hurry --
hurry
Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil

commences hastily to scribble a note She writes

Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes -- yes Im waiting
She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak
the telephone --

(she lets her hand
drop with the receiver
and goes on talking
into the air)
They didnt miss me -- good night
Pimenov
She is about to replace the receiver She sits with it
her hand unreplaced
The music has stopped The room is strangely silent
her the Baron peers from the closet
Her head sinks down upon her hands
A funny singing noise comes from the telephone She

the receiver to her ear In a very strange voice the

of Opehlia she speaks

GRUSINSKAYA
(with great humility)
Oh -- Im sorry yes I have
finished
(she replaces the
receiver)

The foregoing scene is much better played than

is in fact ballet

Quite calmly Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the

Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before
We see the Baron watching He glances at the door

No there is not time

She is returning calmly She
to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a
She looks at it thoughtfully her lips are trembling a
She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth

She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her
hands which contain the veronal she seems to pray

The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance

looks at the door but cant make it Looks on the floor

the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there

eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads

It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert

At this moment she has finished the Baron returns to
hiding place She makes the sign of a cross and goes to
bed

She looks around nervously apprehensively -- like a

who has heard something then reassured She places the
veronal on the night table beside the glass of water

quiet and deliberate She arranges the pillows under
head and lies down She reaches for the bottle of

and empties it generously in her hand She has to lean
upon one elbow from the Barons position in order to

She turns quickly looking at him The glass falls to
floor with a crash and breaks As she moves the
falls out of her hands upon the bed She struggles up
sitting position

BARON
Please do not be alarmed Madam

She glances up at him She is bewildered She seems to
coming out of a trance Again she wants to jump from
bed
BARON
Careful -- theres broken glass on
the floor
Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness She
kimono tightly around her glances across the wide
of bed We see her consider passing over that way but
is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it
a silly movement
BARON
There
(takes a pillow from
the bed throws it
upon the floor over
the glass steps
back)
She gets up quickly and crosses putting on her robe
was lying across the back of a chair

Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame

draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the
puzzled She thinks dreamily What is this She

glances

back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that
this

man must have watched her preparation for bed We get a
sense

of relief with her She is trembling

The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly He
senses his
danger He is caught red-handed with five hundred

thousand
marks worth of pearls in his pocket He is wondering if
she
will ring the bell For an instant he thinks of escape
He
could dash for the balcony He could strike her dead or
silence her with threats There is in the room an
intoxicating
sense of romance and danger (It should be in the
scene)
BARON
Please do not be frightened Madam
GRUSINSKAYA
(after a silence)
What do you want here
BARON
Nothing -- only to be here
GRUSINSKAYA
Why do you hide in my room
BARON
But surely you must know -- because
I love you
GRUSINSKAYA
Because you love me -- you love me
She looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly
she
throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and
more

passionately

BARON
(going over to her)
Poor little Grusinskaya Does it do
you good to cry Are you afraid
Shall I go

GRUSINSKAYA
I was so alone -- always alone --
and suddenly you were there and said
that
(sitting up)
No I am not afraid It is strange

BARON
Dont cry -- it tears my heart to
see you sob like that

GRUSINSKAYA
(regaining control)
Nerves -- just nerves You must
forgive me I have had a bad evening
I am very tired Do you know what it

is to be tired -- tired of a routine
existence

BARON
Im afraid not -- I usually do just

what I feel like doing at the moment

A look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of

the
situation She rises with returning dignity and pulls
her
robe around her -- she is becoming the Grusinskaya of
Imperial
Russia she is the woman Grand Dukes have fought for
She
sweeps across the room
GRUSINSKAYA
So you feel like coming into a ladys
room -- and you come What now
BARON
(following her)
Id like to smoke a cigarette
GRUSINSKAYA
Certainly
She gets her cigarette box from the writing table and
holds
it out to him He takes a cigarette and lights it She
watches

him curiously She smiles as she watches him greedily
inhale
the smoke She crosses and sits before her looking

glass

She brushes her hair back and powders her face She
looks

into the mirror we feel that she has regained a desire
to

live He crosses and looks at her in the mirror He
smiles

GRUSINSKAYA
Why do you look at me like that

BARON
I did not know you were so
beautiful and --

GRUSINSKAYA
(bitterly)
And then --

BARON
No irony Youre so appealing -- so
soft -- so tired I feel like taking
you in my arms and not letting
anything more happen to you -- ever
GRUSINSKAYA
(involuntarily closing
her eyes)
And -- and --
BARON

How tired you are

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes -- tired

BARON
So alone

GRUSINSKAYA

Alone All alone
(whispers in Russian)
Oh you strange -- strange creature

BARON
You mustnt talk Russian to me

GRUSINSKAYA
Strange man

BARON
Am I quite strange to you

GRUSINSKAYA
Not quite strange now It is as if I
had been expecting you You know
once when the Grand Duke was alive
I found a man hiding in my room -- a
young officer --

BARON
And

GRUSINSKAYA
He disappeared Later he was found
dead

BARON
I never knew it was so dangerous to
hide in a womans room when shes
alone
(he embraces her)

GRUSINSKAYA
Go away Who are you --
BARON
A man who could love -- that is all

who has forgotten everything else
for you

GRUSINSKAYA
You could love me It is so long
since I have heard that word Nobody
has loved me for a long time It is
so icy-cold to be famous One is so
cruelly alone How is it that you --
Let me look at you Your hands Your
eyes Why could you love me

BARON
I saw you just now -- then I saw you
cry -- and now I see you in the mirror --
Grusinskaya

GRUSINSKAYA
Grusinskaya Oh -- oh if you knew
how I slaved and slaved for
Grusinskaya -- for the success of
Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of
Grusinskaya and what is she now

Just someone who has found that on
the day success ceases life ceases --
Are you listening to me -- Do you

understand -- I want you to
understand
BARON
Yes -- I do understand
GRUSINSKAYA
think you must go now -- the key

is on the floor

BARON
m not going -- You know Im not
going -- Let me stay here
GRUSINSKAYA

want to be alone

BARON

That is not so -- you dont want to
be alone

(he looks back at the

bed as if remembering

the suicide)

fq

GRUSINSKAYA
I want to be alone --

BARON
No -- You dont want to be alone at
all -- You were in despair before --

If I left you youd feel worse than
you did before You must not be alone --

You mustnt cry -- you must forget
Tell me that I can stay with you --
tell me
GRUSINSKAYA
(whispering)

Just for a minute then

Outside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard --

She whispers
GRUSINSKAYA

The way she says it the word goes home It hurts him

She cant find the other

Business as he gets other slipper for her

He kisses her ankle and looks up at her She smiles
GRUSINSKAYA

Thank you -- you are gallant

(she turns her mood
has changed)

What a sentimental scene Grusinskaya
weeping is a sight worth seeing It

is many years since she did such a
thing You frightened me -- badly
Youre responsible for this -- painful
scene

He watches her
The sound of her own voice reassures her She is

warmth Her cry has done her good she speaks quickly
volubly

GRUSINSKAYA
The stage frays ones nerves the
discipline -- its so exacting

Discipline means doing what you dont
want to do and take no pleasure in
doing Do you know what I mean Have
you ever experienced the weariness
that comes from discipline

BARON
I -- Oh no I do only what I take
pleasure in doing

Grusinskaya turns she is graceful again

BARON
(naive as he says
frankly)

I should like to smoke
She rises She had expected something else His reply
her as chivalrous and considerate She crosses to the
table brings back her little cigarette box which she
out to him He takes a cigarette and lights it She
him curiously She smiles as she watches him greedily
the smoke She crosses and sits before her looking
She brushes her hair back and powders her face She
into the mirror we feel that she has regained a desire
live He crosses and looks at her in the mirror he
GRUSINSKAYA
Why do you smile
BARON
Because I can see something in the
mirror that you cannot My dear --

(he pauses suddenly)

GRUSINSKAYA
What can you see

BARON
You are beautiful

GRUSINSKAYA
No

BARON
Beautiful but so sad I did not know
it was so dangerous to look into a

Suddenly he stoops takes her shoulder in his hands and
it A long tender and sincere embrace
Her eyes close A tremor passes through her Suddenly
whole being is aware of her She turns rises and
herself

GRUSINSKAYA
I think you had better go now The
key is on the floor

He glances back He speaks suddenly with an air of

BARON
Im not going You know that Im
not going Do you think I could
leave you alone here After that --

GRUSINSKAYA
What

BARON
The veronal -- you Im going to
stay here with you

GRUSINSKAYA
I want to be alone

BARON

That is not the truth

(he catches her wrists)
You do not want to be alone -- youre
afraid of being alone -- I know youre
afraid I know you You were
desperate just now if I go away
youll be more desperate than ever
Say I am to stay with you say it

(he almost shakes her)

Her head falls slowly on his breast

GRUSINSKAYA
(whispers)
For just a minute then

quickly to the door
with almost a cry
She looks around for
the key to the door)
No -- oh no
He crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms

BARON
Just for a minute Grusinskaya --

Outside the distant noise of Kringelein and the doctor

He looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat
Imitating the doctor he repeats

KRINGELEIN

Mr Kringelein -- you are drunk --

good night
He puts his hat on the knob of the bed
He takes off his coat holds it up and carefully takes
carnation out of his buttonhole With the coat over his
and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a
and some water which he sees standing on the night
his bed
He puts the carnation in the glass having filled it
water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of

bottles

His demeanor changes He immediately becomes a thing of

He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine

his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain

Naturally I can make no statement at

beginning
GERSTENKORN
(winking at Schweimann)
All right
PREYSING

of what your factory can do We know
all that you could tell us and if
you tell the truth it wouldnt sound
Zinnowitz

us

PREYSING
We did not approach you

WAITZ
(quickly looking
through the papers)
Letter on file September fourteenth
would show that you approached

PREYSING

from his hand --
losing his temper)
It isnt so -- this was a response
to a tentative feeler of your own

GERSTENKORN

violently away)
Tentative my foot -- a month before

very privately and scratched at my

ZINNOWITZ
Good morning gentlemen -- I see the

PREYSING
Oh here you are Justice Zinnowitz --

How clear is Manchester

ZINNOWITZ
Foggy -- frightfully foggy always
Im told

Have you said anything about
Manchester Mr Preysing

PREYSING
I can make no statement about

ZINNOWITZ

throat

ZINNOWITZ

Thank God were beginning at the

Sequence omitted from original script

GRUSINSKAYAS ROOM

The atmosphere has changed the sun shines Grusinskaya
reclining on the chaise-lounge -- her Chinese robe
about her She speaks voluably

GRUSINSKAYA
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition
was in my blood -- no rest no
stopping We were drilled like little
soldiers -- We danced in the school
of the Imperial Ballet in St
Petersburg I was little and slim
but hard as diamond -- a duty machine --
No rest no stopping And then -- I
became famous and whoever is famous
is alone But why should I be
telling you this Last night I did
not know you at all -- who are you
really -- I do not even know your
name

BARON
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern My
mother called me Flix

GRUSINSKAYA
Flix -- And how do you live What
kind of a person are you

BARON
Im a prodigal son the black sheep
of a white flock -- I shall die on
the gallows

GRUSINSKAYA
Really

BARON
Really I havent a bit of character
None at all

GRUSINSKAYA
No
BARON
When I was a little boy I was taught
to ride and be a gentleman -- at
school it was a monastery I learned
to pray and lie -- and ---
GRUSINSKAYA
And
BARON

And then in the war to kill and
hide Thats all

GRUSINSKAYA
And what do you do -- now

BARON
Im a gambler -- Im running at large
like a happy pig devouring anything
of life that pleases me I really
belong in jail

GRUSINSKAYA
Oh What a picture -- and what else
BARON
(seriously)

Im also a criminal and a hotel thief
(he turns away)

GRUSINSKAYA
Thats a silly joke

BARON
(turns -- takes both
her hands)
Please look at me You must believe
me -- you must believe that I love
you -- that I have never known what
love is -- until last night
(he releases her hands
and turns away again)

GRUSINSKAYA
What is the matter

He does not answer

GRUSINSKAYA
Flix

The Baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays

them
before her

BARON
There

GRUSINSKAYA

(with a little cry of
pain)

Oh --
(in the silence
Grusinskaya puts her
head in her hands
and thinks)

The Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and

then
holds back

GRUSINSKAYA
(softly)
Did you come here just -- just for
that Oh -- its horrible

Pause
She is suddenly cold

GRUSINSKAYA
You may keep the pearls -- I dont
want them any more -- Ill make you
a present of them

BARON
(passionately)
I dont want them now

GRUSINSKAYA
(broken)
Ill not denounce you
BARON

I know
GRUSINSKAYA

So --
BARON

Yesterday I was a thief -- but now --
GRUSINSKAYA

But now you must go I give you

the pearls But now you must go ---

BARON
I wanted money desperately -- Can
you understand -- Thats why I wanted
the pearls I was threatened -- I

was desperately in need of a certain
big sum of money Ive been following
you -- Ive admired you But I have
forced myself not to think about you --
Last night at last I managed to

came into your room and -- and now
GRUSINSKAYA
(softly)
And now
BARON

I couldnt go through with it
(his head goes down

into her lap -- he
sighs)
Remarkable
His hand touches her hair -- tenderly
BARON

Do you understand

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes -- yes -- yes

There is a sudden knock at the door

GRUSINSKAYA
Quickly -- here

With a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to
the
bathroom He disappears into the bathroom She opens
the

door after finding the key and radiantly addresses
Suzette

GRUSINSKAYA
Good morning Suzette

SUZETTE
(delighted to see her
in a good mood)
Good morning Madam

She puts the coffee down on the table

Charming piece of business as Suzette in putting the
coffee

down on the table must necessarily push back the
heavily

crested cigarette case of the Baron

SUZETTE
Madam has slept well

GRUSINSKAYA
(enthusiastically)

The Baron

KRINGELEIN
Was the Baron joking or is it really
true that the Baron is -- in financial
straits
BARON
(lightly)

Absolutely true Kringelein and I

monotonous words of the players

White faced the Baron has the bank

Otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and

Baron moves out of scene followed by Doctor As Baron
approaches table

KRINGELEIN
Baron I drink and win -- I drink

(he is pulling money
towards him counting
it eagerly
frantically not the
movement of a miser
not a greedy movement
but the movement of
an excited child
liberated Money has
become so much mad
paper to him)

During the foregoing scene one of the men at the table
has

answered the ringing of the telephone bell he comes
back

now

A MAN

Business ad lib General business of slow normal exit

Kringelein looks up from counting his money He has

like a little boy with a Christmas stocking He looks

suddenly sees men are leaving --

KRINGELEIN

Oh dont go gentlemen -- Stay a

while
(he stands to his
feet)

Be my guests

By this time the men are pausing by the door

so marvelous The first time in my
life I have gambled -- Ive danced

Oh you can laugh gentlemen but

A MAN
(slapping him on back)
Splendid

There is a general feeling in the room that although

man is drunk he is terribly sincere

wish to embarrass themselves or him

and that

In fact

nervous impatient movement among the men But

reached an emotional pitch

there is

there is
serious

him

men

KRINGELEIN
Life gentlemen is wonderful but
very dangerous You must have courage

anything about life

A MAN

Rejoice in life while yet the small
lamp burns
General noise among men some are ribald others are
Two men come and shake hands with Kringelein bidding

The Baron puts his hand restrainingly on Kringeleins
shoulder

Kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard The
are nearing the door
A MAN

Its a short life and a gay one

KRINGELEIN

(seizing a glass of

champagne)
Every glass high to life -- the
splendid dangerous mighty brief --
brief life -- and the courage to

INTERCUT FOR RELIEF -- Kringeleins face -- white
drawn
tragic

One man perhaps remains

MAN
Can I help doctor

DOCTOR
No the Baron will stay

BARON
Certainly

Man leaves During this scene the Baron has been
carefully

making Kringelein comfortable on the bed bolstering
pillows
his

course

we see

in his

behind his head Kringeleins eyes are shut tightly
hands are limp
By the business of the Baron although we do not of

now it this is the time that he takes the wallet from
ringelein and puts it in his own pocket

We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which
his back and his right hand raised as though reaching

inside pocket --

He stands looking down at Kringelein

DOCTOR
(drops Kringeleins
hand)
It will be over in a minute

Kringeleins eyes flutter His voice sounds hoarsely

KRINGELEIN
Over -- over so soon -- it has just
begun
(he closes his eyes
suddenly)
Oh the pain

DOCTOR
Try and sleep Kringelein dont be
afraid

KRINGELEIN
(mutteringly)
Id like to live a little longer but --
Im not afraid to die -- Im not

BARON
(touching his shoulder
gently)
Youll be all right Kringelein
(he moves from the
bed -- takes out a
cigarette moves to
the table He seizes
his drink)

KRINGELEINS VOICE
(out of scene)
My pocketbook my money in it

DOCTORS VOICE
What do you say -- what

We watch Barons face he looks back over his shoulder

DOCTORS VOICE
You what -- Oh isnt it there

KRINGELEINS VOICE
No -- But no I -- Baron Ive lost
my pocketbook

Baron turns in this scene He walks forward toward
them

The Doctors hands are on Kringeleins coat

DOCTOR
There is no pocketbook here On
the floor probably
(He glances down)

KRINGELEIN
(starting up suddenly)
More than fourteen thousand marks
were in that pocketbook

DOCTOR
(looking at Baron)
Fourteen thousand marks One can
travel -- ones happiness might depend
on fourteen thousand marks -- dont
you think so Baron

BARON
(with a shrug)
Quite possibly

At that moment Kringelein who has been staring up at
the
ceiling his hands clenching and reclenching starts

up

KRINGELEIN
Oh Ive got to find it

DOCTOR
Stay where you are

KRINGELEIN
No -- I must find it --
(he starts talking)

Fourteen thousand two hundred marks
(he pulls himself to
the side of the bed)

The doctor goes to restrain him

KRINGELEIN
Im all right Doctor Theres no
pain now -- only you dont know what

that money means to a man like me

He is suddenly on his hands and knees crawling along

the

floor looking for it like a little boy his
drunkenness

his condition makes the situation tragic He actually
gets

under the card table

The Doctor looks at the Baron

The Baron only watches Kringelein He follows him
fascinated

KRINGELEIN

(talking at intervals

as he crawls looking

for money)
You dont know because youve never
lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and
saved and scrimped My life hangs
upon that money Baron Nobody gives
you anything You have to buy
everything and pay cash for it I
wanted to pay for my last days with
that money Every hour costs money
Ive nothing -- nothing but that
pocketbook
he crawls along the
loor on his hands
nd knees talking to

The foregoing speech is intercut with the following

in which Kringeleins voice is heard throughout -- thus
is not a long speech

The Baron watches He throws his cigarette away -- he
his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead again he
thief When he wanted pearls the love of a woman

him Now he wants this money and pity a slow growing
for this tragic dying thing is stopping him -- and all
time the Doctor watches

The one whole eye pierces into the Barons melting
conscience

Twice during the speech at a spot through and during
rehearsal to be selected the Doctors voice droning

piercing says
DOCTOR
He must find his money Baron
(next time)
Mr Kringelein should find his
pocketbook Baron shouldnt he
These are two interjections
And now Kringelein lies upon the floor a troubled
sack of pain his head down
The Baron turns away He bends down as though he were
for the pocketbook We see him take it from his pocket
turn There is a very light almost triumphant ring in
voice as he says
BARON
Here -- here it is Heres your

pocketbook Kringelein

KRINGELEIN
(his head coming up)
Oh -- yes -- thats it -- you found
it -- you found it for me Baron

BARON
(quickly)
Goodnight Kringelein
(he moves towards the

door)
KRINGELEIN
No -- no please -- oh dont go --
dont go -- dont leave me alone
Baron
DOCTOR

Youve nothing to fear Kringelein

KRINGELEIN
No

BARON
Come get up -- come let me help
you

NOTE If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein up

If not he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed

BARON
Youre all right now -- its very
late -- goodnight Kringelein
KRINGELEIN
Oh no stay here Baron -- stay

Baron bites his lip It is the first and only time in
the

play that we see a tear near -- the strong man almost
breaks

DOCTORS VOICE
Goodnight Baron

Kringeleins shoulder --
he exits)

CORRIDOR

Baron shuts door and pauses In front of him is the
the woman he loves Down beyond is his own empty room
his pockets nothing In his CLOSEUP he makes the

feel his problem with him

This man who has lived and whistled and love through
play becomes a tragic lonely harrassed figure The
has broken His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes
hair back

Over this comes with almost an impertinence a tiny

He looks up and away down the corridor The figure of
Flaemmchen stands there a small black bag in her hand

Baron pulls himself together and smiles

characteristically

He walks down the corridor

BARON
Flaemmchen what are you doing here
in the middle of the night

FLAEMMCHEN
Looking for my room -- one sixty-

BARON

night

FLAEMMCHEN
And Baron thanks so much for
everything

They both go into their respective rooms

Here are our two gay young characters The gay fresh
Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron crucified for lack

funds Both trying to smile both trying to be light
themselves Yet each about to involve themselves

for the want of a little money

FLAEMMCHENS ROOM

Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously Except for one
burning the room is in darkness and empty From the
door to Preysings room a thin stream of light She
down her bag quickly tiptoes through the bathroom to

door She peeps through

FLASH OF PREYSINGS ROOM

from her angle

Preysing stretched on bed flat his stomach a mountain
on it the magazine that he has been reading with
picture He is looking at the ceiling She knows he is
because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in
hand

FLASH OF FLAEMMCHEN

An idea occurs to her She could possibly sneak into

he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that
CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room She

closes
the door noiselessly and listens She throws off her
hat and
takes off her coat Opens her bag and takes out night
dress
lingerie etc The lid of her bag falls suddenly She
starts
at the noise Has it awakened him She looks off
SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR
The thin stream of light is filled suddenly the door
of the
adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other
room
the huge form of Preysing appears In this odd lighting
he
is a little more than Preysing He comes forward He
speaks
hoarsely quietly
PREYSING
Flaemmchen
(he seizes her to him)
She goes to his arms passively He rubs his face in her
hair
She is passive -- cold
PREYSING
(breathlessly)
You are late Ive been waiting for
you -- waiting
FLAEMMCHEN
I had to arrange about the trip
PREYSING
Youre sweet
FLAEMMCHEN
You think so
He holds her again trying to kiss her She
deliberately

avoids his kiss

PREYSING
(awkwardly)
Come here
(he sits heavily on
the bed sitting on
her night dress)

FLAEMMCHEN
Here hold up

Preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from
under
him

He draws her to him

FLAEMMCHEN
Oh -- careful Mr Preysing

PREYSING
Call me -- do you know -- would you --
would you like to call me by my first
name

FLAEMMCHEN

(pulling away glad
of an excuse for
conversation)

Oh no

PREYSING
Why not

FLAEMMCHEN
I couldnt do that youre a stranger
to me

PREYSING
Youre a funny little creature
Flaemmchen I cant make you out

FLAEMMCHEN

Its not funny at all One cant get
intimate just off hand I could go
to England with you and everything
like that -- supposing I met you
next year and I said How do you

There is a pause for a moment
PREYSING
Please Flaemmchen -- well leave my
wife out of this
Flaemmchen yawns straight in his face
FLAEMMCHEN
All right Ill get undressed -- get
out
He moves towards the windows which are open She pushes
fat body out almost playfully through the doors and
the balcony
Preysing stands out on the balcony He looks down in
street below then off He starts suddenly because he
shadow over the railing of his own balcony He is
Shadow crosses again Who can be in his room He
forward and peeps through the window One side of the
window is closed From his angle we see the Baron
searching the room He is now wearing an overcoat the

is turned up Business ad lib He finds Preysings

He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket Preysings face
watching him As Baron turns to exit Preysing surges

Preysing)
Preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the
The action excites him
PREYSING
Strike me would you Attack me would

With a terrific lunge Preysing brings the telephone

upon the Barons head The Baron sways stunned (as in

In his mad rage Preysing hits again with the

PREYSING
Ill strike you -- Ill strike you --
Ill strike you -- Strike me

By this time the Baron is a heap on the floor We see
come out of his blind trance He even repeats again
PREYSING

foolishly in his

at what he has done)

PREYSINGS ROOM

New angle Preysing is on his feet He has replaced the
receiver on the telephone he is putting it back

is terrified

Door opens behind him

Flaemmchen with a dressing gown on light filmy
crosses and looks down at the Baron without a word
seizes her

Her hand goes to her head her eyes roll for a moment
think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron
is trying to collect her senses it cannot be true We
hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and
traffic below

Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds

it is the first time we have been conscious of it
With a swift movement Flaemmchen dashes towards the
It is locked She rushes back as if to cut through her
room He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown
her leaving her almost naked He lunges after her She

through her own room
CUT TO
CORRIDOR

Flaemmchen enters from her room She looks this way and

that
After all it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish
running
across the ice in Way Down East -- it is Flaemmchen
a
Berlin girl She pauses to try and clear her brain
What
the hell is this -- what is it The impulse naturally
is to
scream in alarm She doesnt -- Flaemmchens dont She
looks
around At the end of the passage is Kringeleins room
She
will go there We watch her run down the passage
uncertainly
Without knocking she pushes open Kringeleins door
CUT TO
KRINGELEINS ROOM
It is in darkness The only light comes through the
windows
The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed the
Doctor
had just thrown a coat over him He is still in his
trousers
and shirt
Like a ghost Flaemmchen the shreds of her filmy
clothes
hanging to her crosses
FLAEMMCHEN
(hoarse whisper)

She sweeps to bed She shakes him Kringelein starts
up
FLAEMMCHEN

She slides down to the floor by the side of the bed

Kringelein climbs out of bed tries to help her up

KRINGELEIN

Kringelein assumes suddenly a strength He is a man for
