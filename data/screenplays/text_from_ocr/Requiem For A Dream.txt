seductive smile

He tries to stop his mother Sara Goldfarb from locking
herself in the closet

She slams the door closed and Harry talks to the shut door

HARRY
Why do you haveta make such a big

HARRY (CONTD)
Why ya gotta make me feel guilty
(frustrated)

Harry walks across the room to the early eighties TV with
ridiculous rabbit ears

Sara locks the door and retreats to the back of the closet

Harry starts to push the set on its stand when suddenly it
jerks - almost falling Harry spies a thick bicycle chain
going from around the TV to the radiator

HARRY (CONTD)
Jesus Whatta ya tryin to do eh

radiator

Harry marches to the closet

HARRY (CONTD)
-an maybe blow up the whole house

Your own son Your own flesh and
blood WHATTA YA DOIN TA ME

Then a thin key slowly peeks out from under the closet door
Harry works it out with his fingernail and yanks it up

HARRY (CONTD)
Why do you always gotta play games
with my head for krists sake
Dont you have any considerations
for my feelings Why do you haveta

And then meekly from the closet -

SARA

Sara shakes her head in the darkness

SARA
You should be well Harold

HARRY

Harry walks to the TV unlocks the chain and starts to wheel
the TV towards the front door He pauses by the closet

HARRY (CONTD
Ma Ma Cmon out Please Ma

No response Inside Sara hugs her knees
Then he throws up his hands mumbles -

HARRY
Eh screw it

- and pushes the set carefully out of the apartment

In the closet Sara hears the door shut She mumbles to
herself -

SARA

Cops holster

husband Seymour hovers over Harrys left shoulder

On Harrys right is a younger-looking Sara She is thirty
pounds lighter has brilliant red hair and wears a red dress
and gold shoes Sara stares at her outfit

Then she rushes to the closet As she hums a tuneless
monotone she carefully pulls out the last dress on the hook
She ceremoniously removes the dry-cleaning plastic and
smiles at her red dress

She puts it on In the mirror she looks over one shoulder
and then the other She tries to zip up the back but after
half an inch and many minutes of exertion she gives up

On her hands and knees she searches through mounds of shoes
for the special pair She pulls out the gold shoes and
dusts them off Shakily Sara puts them on She smiles at
herself in the mirror

CUT TO
INT SARAS APARTMENT
Sara sits in her viewing chair watching television and

reading her diet book as she slides herself a chocolate
The diet book is called Ten Pounds in Ten Days

She flips through about a hundred pages of introduction
until she comes to the words FIRST WEEK

She stares at the page and suddenly she becomes concerned
She reaches for a chocolate-covered caramel as we read the
page with her
BREAKFAST

12 grapefruit

12 cup lettuce (no dressing)

NOTE Drink at least 2 quarts of water each day

Sara stares and chews

Her eyes focus on the words no 1 and 12 They focus
on the repetition of meals They focus on the insanity
searching for the real information between the lines

She hears a giggle and turns to look at the refrigerator
The fridge tremors slightly -- a small mechanical rattle

Defeated she drops the book and reaches for another
chocolate Her head starts to hang and tears begin to well
up in her eyes

But then she notices something on the television

TAPPY TIBBONS
Now lets meet our next winner
Straight from Brighton Beach
Brooklyn lets give juicy welcome
to Mrs Sara Goldfarb

There she is Herself dressed in red her hair gorgeous
red walking across the screen so slim so trim so sexy
Such curves This is Red Sara

smile

She watches Red Sara pose for the television audience She
can hear the applause and the wolf whistles

She puts the chocolates away and lifts up the book -- new
hope

But she cant concentrate The kitchen clock ticks terribly
slowly So does her Timex

Everywhere she looks in the room steaming hot food appears
Over there by her plants is a bacon doublecheese burger
Then over there by the lamp is a chocolate-covered eclair

She grabs a glass of water and downs it

at it

SARA
Shut up

Suddenly the fridge door becomes transparent She can see
all the produce in her stuffed fridge beckoning her

She turns away and goes into --

She flips off the light and tries to sleep

She closes her eyes but they pop open Then slowly her
beige ceiling disappears and turns into a clear blue sky
with puffy white clouds Then it dissolves into a sizzling
juicy pizza-pie

Sara twists and turns Then the pie turns into a chocolate-
covered cherry Then it becomes a bagel smothered with lox
onions and crowned with a healthy slice of tomato

Theres no hope Sara sits up in her bed and reaches for
the phone She dials

from the front cab They wear ski masks and carry glistening
machine guns

Sitting behind a table in front of the crates of oranges is
a distinguished Bald Man sporting a white fur coat He is
flanked by two other heavies with masks and machine guns

their guns Harry grabs Tyrone and starts to pull him away

when the Pony-tailed Junkie gets nailed in front of them
He slides across the linoleum leaving a trail of blood
