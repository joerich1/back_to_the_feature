PROTOZOA PICTURES

NOAH

by
Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel
IN THE BEGINNING THERE WAS NOTHING

JUST DARKNESS

From black emerges THE APPLE in perfect form velvet
skin bursting with juice it hangs precariously from a
straining twig in

EDEN

Invisible rings of pulsing energy emerge from the fruit
tickling our eyes

A woman’s hand reaches up and plucks the forbidden apple
The twig recoils

Behind us out of sight we hear CRUNCH

FADE TO BLACK

Return on a man’s hand A fist grips a rock His
fingertips pale from lack of blood

The man descends on a second man His brother The rock
rises up

CAIN strikes ABEL down
The rock drops into the spreading puddle of blood

Cain walks away into

BLACKNESS

Now there is nothing again

JUST DARKNESS

We hear a woman CRY A man CRIES too Children CRY
Men SHOUT Women SCREAM Children HOWL

Men FIGHT Women KILL Children DIE

Horse hooves POUND Swords CLASH Animals SQUEAL
Warfare EVERYWHERE Armies SMASH into each other

The earth BURNS Dissonance becomes deafening WHITE
NOISE Piercing agony

Suddenly smash back to
SILENCE
Beat

And these words emerge

Genesis 65
The Creator saw that the wickedness of man was great on
the earth and it grieved His heart So the Creator

said “I am sorry that I have made them I will blot out
man whom I created from the face of the ground”

FADE IN

ON NOAH

At 35 the world already weighs heavy on his shoulders
Deep lines mark his brow

On hands and knees he scrapes lichen and herbs from a
pock-marked rock He collects them in a satchel on his

hip He searches for more plants ona

BARREN HILLSIDE

The earth is scorched and gray All is dead except for
the few scraggly plants that fight to stand up straight

The dust filled air diffuses the low-hanging red sun

Then near Noah a single drop of rain slams into the
ground Noah looks up at the dull sky Not a cloud in
sight

He watches the dry earth suck up the moisture Soon only
the tiny crater where the drop hit is left

A strange WIND whistles low across the ground
An unintelligible WHISPER rides the air

Noah looks around confused
His eldest son SHEM collects herbs up on top of a
nearby ridge The clear-eyed 7 year-old seems not to

have heard anything

Noah’s 5-year old middle son HAM plays with a flowering
weed He too seems to have heard nothing
No one else is around

NOAH
Shem

SHEM
What father

NOAH

Do you feel rain
Shem looks up into the sky He sees nothing

SHEM
No father

Noah shrugs They both return to work

Meanwhile Ham plucks a white weed flower He adds it to
a collection in his palm He looks up mischievously

As Noah works Ham sneaks up and drops a flower into the
satchel Noah doesn’t notice

Ham drops another blossom in Noah sees the weed flower
and tosses it out He returns to work

Ham drops another flower in Noah catches him
NOAH
(sternly)
Ham

The boy freezes His father’s word law He drops the
flowers and tears up

Noah’s heart melts He descends on his son loaded with
tickles The boy’s tears turn into breathless giggles

Noah smiles He points to another patch of flowers

NOAH
Pretty Pick more for mother

Ham waddles off Noah watches him His smile fading too
quickly
Then a second drop of rain hits near his feet He looks

down A thunderous rain instantly muddies the ground

He looks up The rain is gone The dull sky clear The
ground is perfectly dry as if nothing happened Fora
moment strangely the craters in the dust remain And
then they are’ blown away

It is the WIND again stronger now the WHISPER louder

Noah spins afraid Nothing to see He looks up at
Shem His son noticed nothing The boy stares off into
a neighboring valley

Suspicious Noah scans the horizon through squinted eyes

SHEM (0S)
Father

Noah rushes to his frantically waving son

Shem points down from

THE RIDGE
into the valley Before he sees it Noah can hear it

A TRIBE OF HUNTERS corners a large group of giant SINGLE-
HORNED BISON

Thirty humans brutally hack the animals apart fighting
to slice off the horns

NOAH
No
(Furious)
Not
(To Shem)
Mind your brother

Shem takes hold of Ham In the

VALLEY

The poachers pay Noah no mind as he runs into the
Massacre pulling tightly-bound packets from his satchel

He tosses them at the poachers On impact the packets
explode Thick smoke fills the air

The enemy is confused The smoke makes their bodies
break out in hives They panic Most flee

A few pull weapons and attack Noah A master of military
arts Noah quickly disarms the enemy He twists arms
cracks wrists snaps joints and carves through a half
dozen men without breaking a sweat

A last fierce opponent connects weapon to Noah’s flesh
Blood pours from his bicep Noah doesn’t blink He
crushes the bridge of the man’s nose with the heel of hig
hand The poacher collapses

The remainder of the tribe quickly retreats into the
surrounding hills
ae

ee

As the smoke clears Noah whistles for his boys They
stand up from hiding spots on the ridge and make their
way down the hill

Noah dresses the wound on his arm He looks down at the

bison

They are all dead

SHEM
(on Noah’s arm)
Are you all right

NOAH
Fools Such fools

SHEM
Why do they do it

NOAH

I do not know One beast could feed
them all But they hunt for the only
useless part of the body The horn
They think it has power But it is
just like our hair our nails - dead
flesh They kill life for this dead
thing

They hear a yelp A lone JUVENILE BISON limps into sight

Noah beckons for it with an outstretched hand
The bison is unsure Afraid it considers running

Noah calmly looks into its eyes It is drawn to him

It limps forward harboring an injured foot Noah picks
the tiny creature up calming it instantly

HAM
Can we help it

Noah examines the foot and nods

NOAH
Come let’s take her home

Noah stands He carries the creature up the hill

Shem follows leading his younger brother by hand

CUT TO

THE HOME CAMP

Five small domed huts huddle together around a cooking

fire

The sun sets over a distant dormant volcano
NAAMEH Noah’s wife stands to greet her boys
JAPHETH the couple’s newborn sleeps in her arms

The young boys rush to kiss their mother and younger
brother Noah hands the bison to Shem

NOAH
Be gentle

Shem and Ham carefully carry the bison away

Naameh sees Noah’s bandaged arm and weary brow He looks
away kisses Japheth on the head then his wife’s lips
She puts her questions on hold and kisses back

CUT TO

THE INFIRMARY HUT
Ham pets the bison as Shem feeds it through a cloth nipple

Noah prepares an herb salve by firelight He dresses the
bison’s wound

SHEM
Will she get better

NOAH
She will Let her rest with the antelopes

Shem and Ham carefully carry the creature out into

THE PENS

A great many animals recover in the makeshift veterinary
hospital Noah watches the boys set the bison under a
covered shelter

CUT TO

NOAH AND NAAMEH’S HUT AT NIGHT
Naameh prepares their bed as Noah sits with his thoughts

NAAMEH
What is it What happened

NOAH
They hunt now in father’s valley

NAAMEH
Then we move again Further
t

NOAH
Is there anywhere left to disappear

NAAMEHR
There’s always somewhere

Noah doesn’t answer
NAAMEH

We will be all right We will find

a place to raise our boys
Noah doesn’t answer Instead he lays down for sleep
The bloodshed of the day lingers on his mind until he
shuts his eyes and we fade to
BLACK
A beat of just his breaths Then they too fade away
The silence ends with the sound of a rain drop
A single drop

Cur INTO

NOAH‘S DREAM

He stands in the middle of a vast

DRIED-OUT SEABED

Noah stares at the outline of the raindrop in the parched
earth

Now it pours A thunderous rain Water gushes over and
off his nose his chin

Slowly he looks up This time he sees only water

That is because he is

UNDERWATER
He opens his mouth Bubbles rush out

He panics He starts to drown Flailing he SCREAMS

AWAKE IN HIS HUT

Naameh grabs him He takes a deep panicked breath
oe

NAAMEH
Noah

He loosens her grip and pushes

OUTSIDE

He looks up into the night sky Not a cloud in sight
Just the Creator’s stars staring down in judgement

FADE TO

HOME CAMP THAT MORNING

Naameh cooks for the boys Noah sits on a boulder
outside the ring of tents staring at the horizon She
watches him with concern

LATER

EDGE OF CAMP

Naameh sits on the boulder next to her husband He
stares out at the world

NAAMEH
The dream

Noah nods Naameh looks into his eyes She sees
something

NAAMEH
A vision

She considers this for awhile
NAAMEH
Then the Creator speaks to you Like He
did to your great-grandfather no What
did He show you
Noah looks at his wife He can’t say

NAAMEH
You’ve been chosen to hear Him
What did He say

He tears up His voice chokes

NOAH
He’‘s going to destroy the world

Sadness and shock fill her heart
NAAMEH
What Why

NOAH
I don’t

Noah looks out unsure He closes his eyes and takes a
stilted breath through clenched teeth

He opens his eyes into a

VISION

He and Naameh sit on the same boulder But the earth
around them is no longer scorched and dead

It is a thousand years ago maybe ten thousand years ago
It might be the day after creation for the unspoiled
earth looks like what Eden must have

Clear streams filled with healthy fish and ancient
forests filled with creatures that crawl and fly

Noah takes a deep breath The cool moist air fills his
lungs with life But then in a moment it is all gone

Noah returns to

NOW

The contrast is like a punch to the stomach The air
lurches out of his lungs

In front of him are the remnants of a tree that moments
before was alive The tree stump stands before him He
touches the rings of the tree He knows the answer now

NOAH
Because it is dying already At our
hand all He created is dying

NAAMEH
What shall he have us do

NOAH
He must be giving us a chance
That is why He speaks
‘(ponders )
If we change If we work to save
it perhaps he will too

HOME CAMP

Noah chops and mixes herbs and plants Shem
helps him move them into a large basket

THE FIRE PIT

On a nearby ridge Noah sets the basket next
fire On the horizon a tall pillar of rock
POINT sticks up from the desert floor

He nods to his son Shem dumps the contents
basket into the fire

The mixture lights up and burns brilliantly

A thin pillar of red smoke shoots out of the

watches and

CUT TO

to a raging
called THE

of the

fire and

spreads out high in the sky Soon a red cloud hangs

over the Earth

NOAH
Now they will come

Shem’s smile disappears

HOME CAMP
Ham spots the pillar of red smoke

HAM
Look mother

Naameh takes Ham and hugs him tightly

ANIMAL INFIRMARY

AT THE

FADE TO

Noah removes the bandage from the young bison’s hoof

The wound is healed Noah helps the young creature to
its feet She tenderly tests the leg She gets
comfortable and limps off joining the other antelopes

Noah’s smile breaks when he hears Shem

SHEM

Shem points A plume of dust rises in the distance

cur TO

HOME CAMP
Noah emerges from his hut wearing his priestly robes

NAAMEH
Is it safe

Noah looks at her but does not answer She sees he must
do this

NAAMEH
Be careful

Husband and wife kiss

FADE TO

THE POINT

A mesa rises up thin and straight from the ground like a
giant column

The red cloud floats high above it

Noah stands at the base of the hand-hewn stairs that
spiral up to the mount He starts to climb

FROM

THE MOUNT

The dust plume is close Through a scope Noah spots
riders carrying regal banners of royalty

AT

THE BASE

Fifty men ride giant mutated HORSE-BEASTS The creatures
resemble horses but have predator jaws and long nailed
paws

The ROYAL GUARD parts to reveal their leader AKKAD The
gruff hulking man motions for them to stay as he takes
the stairs alone

BACK ON
THE MOUNT

Noah waits He sits on a small stool on a worn rug

Behind him is an ancient prayer hut
Sweating but not winded Akkad arrives

AKKAD
I am Akkad I speak for all men
from sea to sea
(points all directions)
And from sea to sea Who is it that

calls me with the sign of our fathers

Noah stands

NOAH
Noah son of Lamech son of
Methusaleh son of Enoch before him
I call you as is my right as heir to
the line of Adam

AKKAD
Methusaleh Enoch I know these
names But not yours Noah

Noah nods back towards his home below the volcano

follows his gaze

NOAH

My family has chosen to live alone in

private studying the world healing
it as best we can But now the

Creator calls upon me to speak Look

Noah motions over the ravaged landscape

NOAH
The world squirms beneath our foot a

poisoned husk The Creator sees this

He mourns it and will tolerate it no

longer He would annihilate all in an

instant rather than watch this
creeping rot

Akkad stares at Noah

AKKAD

Strong words And what would you have

me do

NOAH
We must change We must treat the
world with mercy so that the Creator
will show us mercy

Akkad

AKKAD
Mercy How do you mean

NOAH
We must respect the ground Respect
the rivers and seas Respect the
other beasts of the Earth Stop the
slaughter the rape the carnage

Akkad starts to snicker The snicker becomes an outright
laugh

NOAH
You laugh at me

AKKAD
At your Creator He gives us a land
filled with death Where it is
impossible to find game to hunt Where
the ground no longer produces life and
food My people go hungry die by
sword and sickness and you would have
me pull the very meat out of their
mouths If this Creator wants our
fealty let him fill our bellies first

Akkad moves towards the stairs Noah grabs him

NOAH
Wait You must listen

Akkad turns and WHACKS Noah across the face with his axe
handle

SMASH TO

BLACK FOR A MOMENT

Slowly Noah wakes with blood on his lip He moves to
the edge of the mount

Akkad and his men are long gone But then he spots black
smoke rise over the volcano The volcano near his home

NOAH
No

He rushes down the stairs

CUT TO

HOME CAMP

The huts burn The fields have been trampled The
animals massacred

Akkad and his royal guard are just charging off They
carry whatever spoils they have found

Before they are gone Akkad looks back at Noah and smiles
a gentle satisfied grin from the crest of a distant
ridge And then he is gone

NAAMEH
Noah

Naameh leads the 3 boys out from a hiding hole in the ground

They are unharmed Noah rushes over and hugs them

At their feet lies the carcass of the young bison they
just healed Its baby horn sliced off Blood leaks from
the open hole

FADE TO

REMAINS OF THE CAMP
The heart of night Noah has managed to build a fire to

keep warm Naameh holds on to him The kids sleep
nearby He stokes the fire with a stick

FADE TO

BLACK
A long beat of silence
A rain drop a single drop crashes against the ground

CUT IN

NOAH’S DREAM -

Noah stands in the middle of a vast

DRIED-OUT SEABED

He stares at the outline of the raindrop in the parched earth

He looks around The horizon stretches forever In one
direction and only one direction there is a lone
mountain shooting out of the earth

Noah knows this mountain It is from his childhood
NOAH

(whispers)
Grandfather

He steps towards it Just then it starts to pour

A thunderous rain Water gushes over and off his nose
his chin

Now he is

UNDERWATER

A corpse floats by Noah’s eyes go wide Suddenly he
is looking down on all of humanity

Millions upon millions of dead And only he is alive
Bubbles rush out of his mouth

He panics He flails He screams

AWAKE

Back at his

HOME

Naameh hugs him His breaths short

He looks up at the nighttime sky The stars stare down
NOAH

He doesn’t wish them to listen
They are meant to die

NAAMEH
All of them

NOAH
Punishment For what they’ve
done

NAAMEH

And what of us

NOAH
We are to go to Ararat

NAAMEH
To grandfather

NOAH
Yes We must go

NAAMEH
When

Noah looks up The morning wears upon the edge of night

5 NOAH
Fl Now

CUT TO
DESOLATE WASTELAND
A mean wind descends upon Noah and his family
Noah carries Ham on his back Naameh has Japheth
strapped to her chest Shem follows
Everything is dead and sullen around them

FADE TO

BARE RISE

The wind has died down Shem leads the family up a hill
playing a tune on his flute

On the horizon is the mountain from Noah’s dream

J NAAMEH
vl Is that it
NOAH
Mt Ararat
NAAMEE

You think he lives still

At the hill’s crest Shem stops playing He stares off ata

BURNING VILLAGE
Homes and fields drenched in flames

NAAMEH
Let us go around

Noah heads into the settlement
NOAH
No let the children see This is

what we have become

The family follows him into

Ss THE CENTRAL PLAZA

All the inhabitants of the village are here’ They have
been slaughtered and piled in heaps

Nothing moves Only a lone RAVEN hops from corpse to
corpse The boys looks at the horror

NAAMEH
It’s enough
NOAH
(agrees)
Come
SHEM (0S)
Mother

Noah and Naameh turn Shem holds the hand of a young
girl maybe six

They rush back to have a look
The girl moans in and out of consciousness

Noah looks she has a severe belly wound He pulls
herbs and bandages from his pack and starts to treat her

NOAH
Your name you have a name
YOUNG GIRL
Ila
NOAH

Ila You are going to be all
right Ila Shem is going to hold
your hand and he won’t let go

She looks gratefully up at Shem as he squeezes her hand

Something startles the Raven It flies off A distant
rumble Noah hands the bandages to Naameh and hurries up a

SMALL HILL

He sees a warring ARMY approaching Noah rushes back and
scoops the girl up

NOAH
Come we must move

Just as they leave the village the army pours in The
family moves out into the bush towards Mt Ararat

Noah holds the girl tight He looks up when he notices
that his family has stopped

NOAH
What

Naameh and the boys stare up at a giant skull It would
look human if it weren’t the size of a beach ball It
rests neatly on a post

In both directions giant skulls placed on posts sit every
thirty feet Less a barrier than a warning

NAAMEH
What are they

NOAH
Watchers

NAAMEH
They exist

SHEM

Like the stories

NOAH
This must be where the last survivors
were banished

SHEM
Do they still live

NOAH
I do not know They would be ancient
if they did But if they do they have
no love for man

Behind them the approaching army spots them They hear
cries Men mount beasts and start to come after them

NAAMEH
They’ve seen us

Noah looks up at grandfather’s mountain Looming so
near Yet the skulls before him are intimidating

Noah looks at Ila feverish in his arms

NOAH
Come Follow me

Noah guides his family between two large skulls into the

INTERZONE

The mounted soldiers arrive moments later But they stop
at the skulls

They call for Noah to come back They warn the family of
doom But Noah pays them no mind

A hundred yards later they come to a second barrier this
one is made of human skulls and faces into Watcher lands

NOAH
Warning for them as well

Ham starts to cry Naameh scoops him up They pass the
barrier and enter

WATCHERS’ LAND

Grandfather’s mountain beckons them

FADE TO BLACK

And this quote

GENESIS 64
Giants walked the Earth in those days and later too

These were mighty men of ancient times the men of
renown

Return to a

DESOLATE GORGE ON WATCHERS’ LAND

The family moves silently and quickly Mating beetles
fill the air with a piercing whistle Large fissures in
the ground reach down to underground caverns Huge
remnants of what must have been massive buildings jut
diagonally out of the ground

Suddenly the beetles go quiet

Noah stops Gently he places Ila on the ground as he
unfastens his blade

Then he is cast in shadow Noah spins

Blocking the sun towering over him stands OG a WATCHER

18 feet tall ageless sexless and covered with a light
dusting of fur Breathing heavily the angry beast has
six fully functional arms

Ham and Shem wail Naameh hugs them

The ground shakes Ten then twenty then thirty more
Watchers climb out of the cracks in the ground

Og reaches for the family Noah grabs his magic packets
and tosses them at 0g’s feet But Og rips his own
packets from his belt He throws them at Noah’s They
collide and are defused

Noah is stunned Og nods to his fellow Watchers

Three of them with sticks and collars step forward and
quickly pin Noah to the ground

CUT TO

WATCHER’S ROOST

Noah’s hands are cuffed behind his back His family is
bound next to him

SAMYAZA the scarred and grizzled leader of the Watchers
stares down at Noah from a giant throne of human bones

He looks at Og and speaks the language of the ancients

SAMYAZA
(in Ancient with subtitles)
Spies Take them to the Hollow and let
them rot

Og starts to act but Noah speaks
NOAH
in Ancient with subtitles)
We are not spies

The Watchers are stunned by Noah’s linguistics

NOAH
We only wish to pass through your Land

SAMYAZA
You speak our tongue

NOAH
My grandfather taught me He
lives on Ararat We cross your
lands to reach him

Og’s eyes light up

OG
He is a child of the old one

Samyaza rises up Og cowers

SAMYAZA
Quiet Don’t be a fool This is
aman Men cheat They steal
They kill

OG
But Samyaza he travels with
children An injured child

SAMYAZA
A trick Remember In years
past they have used even their
babies to enslave us Men can
never be trusted

He leans in and glares at the children They shrink in
terror

SAMYAZA
They are all traitors They
betrayed us after they betrayed
the Creator

NOAH
It is He who sent me

The Watchers gasp as one Samyaza explodes in fury

SAMYAZA
You lie I sat next to the Creator
as he formed the first man Would
he speak to you a man before he
speaks with me No this is a
trick Take them let them rot
alone under the sun

The Watchers descend upon the family As they are
dragged away Og looks deep into Noah’s eyes

SAMYAZA
(calmer to 0g)
The Creator does not speak
anymore Og to anyone You know
that He has left us alone here
forever

Samyaza sinks into a glum silence And Og ponders

CUT TO

THE HOLLOW AT DUSK

The family is stuck in a pit The last rays of the
ruthless sun abandon the sweating family as well Noah
searches for escape but the walls are steep

FADE TO

LATER

Noah paces unsure what to do His children sleep in
their mother’s arms Somewhere far away Noah can hear
the Watchers arguing He listens but cannot make out
their words

Ila the young girl moans Shem holds her hand

Noah carefully looks at her wound She has a severe cut
on her stomach He cleans it The pain wakes the little
girl who breathes in sharply

NOAH
Shh You will be all right I
will make sure of it

She believes his voice and stares up into his eyes They
connect for a moment He dresses the wound with fresh
bandages but the contact of the new cloth makes her cry

So Noah starts to hum an ancient tune A lullaby He
lifts the girl up and rocks her back and forth back and
forth And now he sings

NOAH
Sleep my child
Surrender
to the wild
Find your breath
Find your peace
Sleep my child
Surrender to the wild
Find your breath
Find your peace

The girl dozes off Noah lays her down next to Shem
Naameh places a hand on her husband’s shoulder

NAAMEH
(whisper)
How is she

NOAH
Her womanhood is gone
She shall never bear children
C

NAAMEH
But will she survive

NOAH
If any of us do

They hear a sound

Noah looks up A Watcher descends down on the wall His
six arms makes it look easy

He drops silently into the pit It is 0g Noah pushes
Naameh behind him The giant’s teeth glisten in the
moonlight

Man and Watcher stare each other down
Og reaches out a hand Noah hesitates 0g nods

Noah reaches out

CUT TO

WATCHERS’ LAND

Moving quickly towards Mt Ararat in the north Og leads
the family through the dark night

NAAMEH
Why help us

Noah translates Og considers before answering

OG
The Creator formed us on the second
day the day He made the heavens We
stood by His side and watched all
Creation flower To us everything
He made was beautiful but man was
the most beautiful of all

Og wallows in his nostalgia Noah translates to the family

OG

We watched over Adam and Eve Saw
their frailty and their love And then
we saw their fall We saw the Creator
expel them from His Garden We pitied
them One mistake one forbidden bite
and they were sent out to scrape a hard
existence from the dry soil

(beat)
Samyaza was the greatest of us then He
loved men most of all and decided we
should leave the Creator’s side and come
down to help man
ae

As Og speaks we glimpse

THE DAWN OF HUMANITY

All white winged Watchers descend through clouds They
glide to Earth

They pick up speed faster and faster Their wings start
to tear apart They ignite 0g Samyaza and all the
Watchers plummet as they burn

From the ground humans watch comets shoot out of the sky
The Watchers smash into Earth

Without wings slowly they stand in blackened craters
Their pure white color now the familiar gray

Humans arrive to stare at these “gods” Back to now in

WATCHERS’ LAND
Og leads as he tells his story

OG
We taught man all we knew Magic and
Science Knowledge of plants stars
metals and fire Of all things that
would help them live upon the land But
they surprised us

Return to

THE DAWN OF HUMANITY

Men turn knowledge into tools
The tools soon become weapons

OG
They turned our gifts to war Turned
them first against the ground water air
and beasts And then back upon us

Men attack the Watchers 0g Samyaza and others fight
back but there are too many of them

OG
We were hunted Many of us enslaved
We were forced to fight back to
survive To hide in this forsaken
land

Back in

ad WATCHERS’ LAND
Dawn approaches The outline of Mt Ararat before them

OG
We asked The Creator to take us home
But He was silent He has turned his
back on us All these years we have
lived here forsaken and alone And now
you say you have heard the Creator
Samyaza cannot believe this he is too
angry and bitter But I look at you
and I see the same awe I saw in Adam’s
eyes The Creator speaks with you I
do not know why But I believe it
And I will help you

They arrive at the far end of the Watcher’s lands on
this side too is the barrier of human skulls

OG
Perhaps the Creator will open his
heart to me again

NOAH
I do not know I hope so But I

oo will accept your help Join us

Noah walks north through the barrier of skulls He
stops Og looks over his shoulder unsure He takes a
breath and follows

Naameh sets Ham down He whines until 0g scoops him up
Ham panics for a moment but Og moves him from arm to arm
The boy loves it and starts to laugh

The family laughs as well

CUT TO

BASE OF MT ARARAT

Noah pitches the huts while Naameh cares for Ila With
one hand Og scoops out the dirt for a fire pit

Noah grabs some warm clothes Turns to his boys

NOAH
I will be back by morning

a He heads up the mountain Froma

MOUNTAIN REST POINT

Noah looks down on his camp Naameh has started a fire
She’s probably cooking

He looks off to the horizon Nothing but empty parched
sad earth He looks up the mountain behind him

Still a ways to go He continues

UP TO

OUTSIDE METHUSALEH’S CAVE
Noah reaches a modest opening in the mountain

He takes a moment to catch his breath and contemplate the
late sun

He removes his shoes and places them near the entrance of
the cave Then he heads

INSIDE

It is dark

Noah advances Soon the light from outside disappears
Until everything is pitch black Just footsteps

Up ahead a single candle flame glows

As Noah approaches it grows brighter The sides of the
cave are revealed

Noah sits down and breathes

On the far side of the flame sits his grandfather
METHUSALEH Praying

The oldest man alive he walked the earth when Adam still
lived His uncut 900 year old hair attests to this

Two cups of steaming tea sit between them Noah waits
for his grandfather to acknowledge him

A long beat

The old man slowly raises his chin Then his eyes creep
open They sparkle with youthful immortality

The old man smiles oh so very slightly
METHUSALEH
Grandson

NOAH
Grandfather

Methusaleh motions to the tea Noah drinks

METHUSALEH
What did He show you

NOAH
Water Flood

Methusaleh lets out a sad sigh

NOAH
I tried to warn them But their
leader
METHUSALEH
No need He has judged man
NOAH
Yes But us Why does he call me
METHUSALEH
I do not know
NOAH
But I saw Ararat He sent me
here
METHUSALEH
I have only this It is from my
father
NOAH
Enoch
METHUSALEH

The day he went to walk with the
Creator he gave it to me and said
one day it was to come to you

He hands Noah a cloth wrapped package Inside is a
ancient wrinkled seed

NOAH
A seed What is it for

But grandfather does not answer He closes his eyes
Slowly he lowers his chin

NOAH
Grandfather

Sas

(a

ey

But there is no answer Noah looks at the seed in his
palm

CUT TO

MOUNTAIN BASE CAMP

Noah sits at the camp’s fire He churns the red hot
coals with a stick

Og and the children sleep
Naameh holds onto Noah

NOAH
Nothing He knew nothing

NAAMEH
What are we to do

Noah doesn’t have an answer

FADE TO BLACK

IN THE DARKNESS
The sound of a drop of rain Then more

A storm Now

UNDERWATER

Noah is calm He is alone He looks around Nothing
but water

Suddenly there are animals everywhere around him
They are underwater and they are drowning

He looks up

Up above is the surface to the ocean of water he is now
beneath

He starts to swim He swims for the surface

And then he sees it

A rectangle of darkness floats on the surface It isa
ship His eyes burst open

AWAKE

He rushes

GENESIS 613
And the Creator said unto Noah “I have determined to
make an end of all flesh for the Earth is filled with

violence through man behold I will destroy them with the
Earth Make yourself an Ark”

When the words disappear we

FADE IN

MAIN HUT
Everyone sleeps Noah hears a noise He wakes

He looks around No one stirs Shem holds the young
girl’s hand asleep

The noise is coming from beyond the tent Noah rushes

OUTSIDE
He spots Og being dragged away

NOAH
Stop

A mob of Watchers turn to face Noah Samyaza spins
around

SAMYAZA
This is not your business man

NOAH
There is work to be done Help us

SAMYAZA
Help you Your kind turned our charity
into our torture You wish to wipe us
clean from this world You anger me man
and now I will show you fury

Samyaza rises up His chest surges His eyes narrow
Noah is terrified

OG
No
(hs

Og leaps upon Samyaza They wrestle The other Watchers
pull Og away Samyaza unleashes his sword He raises
it ready to kill But suddenly he stops

He hears something -- BUBBLING WATER They look over to
the sound

In the same spot where Noah planted Methusaleh’s seed
they watch water push out of the dry earth

A gentle fountain gurgling water

Noah approaches the fountain He bends down and tastes
the water

Nothing remarkable Just clean crisp water

Then the earth begins to rumble An earthquake He
backs away unsure what it is The Watchers look around
concerned The rumbling grows louder

Noah spots a plant push out of the ground thirty feet
away The plant quickly grows into a mature fully grown
tree

And now next to it another tree forms The rumbling
grows something moving underground in all directions

Naameh rushes out followed quickly by the terrified boys
Og picks them up protectively

More trees burst from the earth A spiral of growing
forest circles Noah his family and the Watchers

We rise high above this miracle and witness a hundred
acres of fresh woods emerge

The Watchers are stunned Shem takes his father’s hand

SHEM
What’s this

NOAH
A miracle son A miracle to
start us on our way My axe now
Go fetch it

Shem runs to get it
Og looks to his fellow Watchers
OG
See This man does not lie

We need to help

Unsure the Watchers turn to Samyaza The ancient giant
limps over and touches a tree

Samyaza looks up at Og There are tears in his eyes

SAMYAZA
This is the Creator’s work The
Creator is here I see that We
will help this man Noah Maybe
the Creator will forgive and take
us home

Shem hands the axe to his father

Noah walks to the first tree He runs his hand over the
bark Takes a silent moment of prayer

NOAH
Thank you

He takes a deep breath Then swings the axe It lands
with a loud THWACK

SHEM
Look

Noah follows Shem’s eyes Earth around the pool of water
formed by the new fountain cracks apart Water pushes
into the cracks forming rivulets

Noah whacks the tree again The rivulets get longer
radiating out from the burbling fountain

NAAMEH

What are they for

NOAH
I don’t know More miracles
Unless Yes

He starts to laugh and then to chop harder He whacks
again and again The rivulets shoot past the family

The Watchers start to help Og grabs a high branch and
starts to pull Samyaza does the same

We drift higher and higher over the forest

DEEPER IN THE FOREST

We can still hear Noah’s chopping With each chop the
water tendrils stretch further and further away along the
forest floor

THE EDGE OF THE FOREST

We no longer hear Noah’s chopping but we sense the rhythm
as the rivulets stretch out of the forest They reach -
out across the cracked dry soil to the ends of the earth

FADE TO BLACK

A DEAD SEA

As seasons change a single rivulet whips across a dried
up ocean bed It passes a rotting wooden ship grounded
centuries ago

The rivulet splits in two and then branches off again in
every direction They stretch out like nerve endings

FADE TO BLACK

ROCKY LANDSCAPE

Fall to winter to spring to summer all in a flash But
still the water works it’s way up a steep hill defying

gravity

FADE TO BLACK

IN THE DARKNESS

These words burn

GENESIS 619

“And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring
two of every sort into the Ark to keep them alive with
you they shall be male and female of the birds
according to their kinds and of the animals according to
their kinds of every creeping thing of the ground
according to its kind two of every sort shall come in to
you to keep them alive”

RETURN TO

A DUSTY FIELD

A skinny mangy dirty FEMALE DOVE pecks at the ground
searching helplessly for something to eat
Ao

The rivulet rushes by tossing the Dove into the air
Confused the Dove circles trying to get its bearings
It lands next to the rivulet

The Dove examines the water Pecks at it Then takes a
long drink

The bird looks towards the rivulet’s source It blinks
Then it leaps into the air and soars following the
water

FADE TO BLACK

OVER A BARREN LANDSCAPE

Nighttime the Dove continues to fly Down below two
rivulets reunite into a single one

Various animals of all shapes and sizes follow the water

A great migration The greatest migration ever

FADE TO BLACK

DESOLATE LANDSCAPE
The Dove flies on the dying world passes beneath her

FADE TO BLACK

THE EDGE OF THE FOREST
As the sun rises the Dove can just make out the forest

The Dove rises up high into the blue sky and we reveal

THE ARK

A massive wooden rectangle 450 feet long 75 feet wide
45 feet tall the Ark is 80 completed

The fountain at the center of the forest still bubbles up
from the earth but now a shallow pond has formed lapping
against the great ship’s side

A small army of Watchers work on the ship Some log
some perform carpentry others seal it with tar

Noah is in the center of it all Ten years have passed
and the foreman is starting to gray

The Dove lands at his feet He reaches out a hand

JAPHETH aged 10 now runs right at the bird The bird
flutters away

NOAH
Gentle

Noah watches the bird circle the Ark And for the first
time he sees a cloud in the otherwise clear sky

It seems to be moving towards them

CUT TO

DEEP IN THE FOREST

Moving quickly now with a YOUNG WOMAN no more than 17
full of life beauty and innocence Rushing past trees
ducking under branches until exhausted she trips

A moment later a YOUNG MAN descends upon her A
lumberjack’s shoulders carpenter’s hands poet’s eyes

She yelps as they wrestle on the forest floor but not
from terror

YOUNG WOMAN
No please no

He bites her neck She giggles He kisses her lips
She kisses back

The kisses start to roam She kisses his ears His
neck He kisses her throat The dimple above her
collarbone The space between her breasts

His hands and lips glide lower He removes her shirt
She resists But he insists He kisses her belly

A thick scar lies across it We recognize this scar
The woman is Ila the young girl Noah saved years ago
That makes the young man Shem He kisses the scar

tenderly His hands caress it and pass lower

Ila trembles and then she winces

ILA
Shem wait
‘Shem presses his luck
SHEM
(teasing)

I am waiting

Ila winces again She grabs his head and pulls him up to
her She kisses him strongly and between kisses

ILA
Please I want to I do But I
can’t You know

SHEM
It still hurts

ILA
Father says it always will

Shem lowers his hand frustrated A branch cracks They
both look Shem scurries quickly to investigate

Through the bush he spots HAM now 15 and very curious
watching them Ham sees Shem blushes and runs away

Shem frowns then turns back to his love But she is
staring up at the sky

He follows her eyes up

A stream of birds crosses the sky The stream soon turns
into a river The river a moving sea The forest
darkens as the countless wings blot out the sun

The lovers grab hands and rush towards

THE ARK

Noah hears the calls first Then he sees the BIRDS
converge from every direction He stares up at the great
circling diving mass cackling and cawing their songs

The family circles around Noah as some of the birds touch
down before him

He spots a Raven Next to it is a second Raven Male
and female

He stretches out his right hand the Raven leaps onto it
He reaches out his left hand The other Raven leaps up

He looks at both birds The birds look at him He
brings his hands together Their beaks touch He lowers
his hands and the Ravens fly off into the Ark

Noah spots another pair of birds He places out two
hands They leap up touch beaks and fly into the Ark

Noah smiles Pair by pair he starts loading the ship

NAAMEH
A miracle
(4

The boys smile with glee Ham and Japheth rush after a
pair of birds into

THE ARK

They follow the birds as they soar through the empty
ship They land and perch next to the previous pair of
birds Two more birds arrive then two more

FADE TO

OUTSIDE THE ARK

The sun has set Up on the Ark Shem oversees his
Watcher shipbuilders He wipes his sweaty brow and peers
down on his father

Noah continues to load the boat The line of birds looks
like it will never end

FADE TO

LATER AT DAWN
The morning sun wakes Naameh who sleeps by the entrance

Noah still stands before her He is barely conscious
His eyes flutter open and closed His pupils are
unfocused

The ground is covered with feathers There is only one
bird left It is our Dove It looks up at him

He reaches out his hands The Dove does not move
NOAH
(barely audible)
Come be spared
But the Dove does nothing Naameh walks to her husband
NAAMEH
It has no mate So perhaps it
cannot come

Noah looks up at the sky for the dove’s partner

NOAH
Then we wait

NAAMEH
The bird can wait You need rest

She leads him towards the boat

CUT TO

BLACK

Noah wakes up

INSIDE

The noise is deafening He exits his hut wiping sleep from
his eyes

The Ark is filled with two of every species of bird
Japheth pets a bird in his hand

NOAH
Japheth

The boy freezes Noah takes the bird away

NOAH
Listen all of you Look Here are two
Two and only two of each kind

Noah opens some herb filled jars stored nearby He mixes
the contents together

NOAH
If they survive the storm they will
breed and spread across the world But
if a single creature in our care dies
then a piece of holy Creation will be
lost forever So we must treat them
with the greatest care

Noah lights the mixture It burns Then he douses it
with water Smoke pours out He blows the smoke onto
the birds They fall into a slumber

The boys are amazed Noah hands the dish to Ham

NOAH
They will sleep This my sons will be
your job Make sure all the beasts
that enter this Ark sleep There are
only two Two of each Remember
that They will sleep and they will
be safe

Naameh follows Noah

OUTSIDE

The Dove still waits

Noah looks down at it Then up at the sky No birds
But a pocket of white fluffy clouds floats up above over
the Ark and the surrounding forest Some patches of the
dusk sky still peek through but not many

Ham comes out and stands next to his mother and father

HAM
Father

NOAH
Yes son

HAM

All the birds are twos You have
mother Shem has Ila But what
of me And Japheth Who is there
for us

Noah hesitates worried Then he picks up his son
NOAH
People will come many people will
come they will follow the beasts
And when they do we can find you
a wife
Ham smiles But Naameh screams and points

NAAMEH
The ground is moving

The ground undulates and closes in on the Ark

Noah steps forward peering into the darkness The
REPTILES of the world have arrived

Lizards snakes newts salamanders turtles and their
like approach They stretch across the open field to the
forest in the distance

Noah kneels down before them

He reaches out his hands Two by two they approach and
pass by him

Naameh watches two snakes slither by

NAAMEHR
The pests as well

NOAH
All of the Creator’s creations
Each after its kind They all
must be saved

cur TO

IN THE FOREST

Shem is a master lumberjack and with only a few chops he
fells a great tree

The three Watchers assist Shem With six arms and great
might they are even more efficient than Shem

The Watchers load the trees onto a sled and start heading
back towards the Ark

Shem hears a strange noise He looks over The Watchers
stop and look back at Shem

SHEM
Go ahead

The Watchers head off into the bush

Shem moves to another tree He notices some blood on the
ground Curious he follows the trail and finds more
blood a lot of blood

A few more feet and he finds the discarded remnants of a
dead SPIKED WARTHOG

He climbs around a bend and sees the MAMMALS arriving
from every direction rats wild dogs the great cats
gazelles antelopes rhinos oxen elephants Many of
the animals we recognize many we don’t

Tracking them and feeding off of them are hordes of
REFUGEES beyond number

Shem keeps moving to get a better vantage point when he
walks into a tribe of MEN feasting on poached animals

The men stare at Shem Shem stares at the men
They reach for their weapons He rushes into the bush

The men chase Running at full speed Shem leaps for an
overhanging branch and swings himself up into the canopy

The enemy runs by oblivious

Japheth secretly slides the tiny lizards into his satchel

OUTSIDE THE ARK

Noah loads the last two reptiles into the Ark He sighs
a moment to rest He looks at the Dove which still
waits

He lowers his head and heads into the Ark when Shem
rushes out of the forest

SHEM

Just then HORDES push out of the tree line

The people spot the Ark They point stunned and amazed
They start to approach

From atop the ship Og puts six hands to his mouth and
lets out a mighty bellow

From all directions The Watchers hear the call and
descend on the Hordes The humans see the mythical
Monsters approach and they quickly retreat in terror

LATER AT THE MOUTH OF THE ARK
Og Shem and Noah discuss options

NOAH
They will return Whether through
courage or fear Sooner or later
they will come

(to Og)
Can you hold them when they do

OG
There’s too many Eventually they
will overwhelm us

Noah looks up to the sky The grey clouds have a touch
of angry black in them now

Og stops working He senses something He looks out at
the tree line

He screams for Noah

DOWN BELOW

Noah looks up Fifty mounted men carrying white flags
approach

Their leader is AKKAD the same man Noah met at the
Point Akkad is grey and scarred by years of war

He rides his mount back and forth behind the mass of
beasts waiting to be loaded onto the Ark

AKKAD
Noah Son of Lamech Noah

Shem joins his father’s side
NOAH

How many days till you’re
finished

SHEM
Three at best

Noah looks to Og and his fellow Watchers

NOAH
come

Noah walks towards Akkad the animals parting to let him
pass Akkad spots Noah and smiles He trots towards
him When they get close Akkad dismounts He walks the
final distance to face Noah

AKKAD
Old friend

Noah sees a baby bison horn hanging from Akkad’s neck
It must be the same horn he stole a decade past

NOAH
What do you want

AKKAD
You told me once the world would be
destroyed Such a good friend I
should have believed you I didn’t
Not till we saw the great exodus of
beasts Not till the scouts followed
them to a forest that should not exist
A forest covered by rain clouds

Akkad looks at the dark sky and laughs

AKKAD
Well I believe you now You’ll be
glad to know I’ve repented Noah
Repented deeply just as you preached
And I think I deserve to be saved
Don’t you

NOAH
Then save yourself The trees are
plentiful Start building

AKKAD
I think I like your ship The
Creator will surely protect it

NOAH
The Ark is full

AKKAD
Full

Akkad laughs It’s preposterous that the immense boat
could be full Then he puts it all together

AKKAD
Beasts

NOAH
By the Creator’s command

AKKAD
Well unload them Look at my people

Akkad nods to his FLAG BEARER He raises the flag In
response thousands of flags rise out of the forest His
soldiers hidden in the woods let out a deafening cry

AKKAD
On my word these armies shall storm
the forest They shall storm your
ship We will kill your beasts and
murder your family

Noah weighs the threat He looks to Shem and the days of
work left on the Ark

NOAH
Very well We will help each other
Friend When the time comes I will
take ten men of your choosing

Shem steals an incredulous glance at his father

SHEM
Father

Noah stares Shem into silence

AKKAD
Twenty-five With women

Noah nods Shem bristles

NOAH
But you must do your part Your
people obey you now There is still
order But if you leave their
allegiance will dissolve You must
give them hope Have them build
ships When the rain comes then come
to me with your twenty-five

AKKAD

I will come with the rains Noah
With twenty-five if you keep your
word Or if you cross me I will come
with thousands

satisfied)
Until the rains then

Akkad rides off with his men

NAAMEH
Wonder what

NOAH
If a world without men would be a

NAAMEH
What do you mean

NOAH
Perhaps the Creator does not mean
us to find wives for Ham and
Japheth

NAAMEH
(alarmed)
Then there will never be anymore
children No more people

Noah looks at Naameh That’s exactly what he meant

NAAMEH
No It makes no sense Then why
would He let us survive

NOAH
To shepherd these beasts to safety
Maybe that is all And then
mankind disappears It would be a
better world

NAAMEH
But these are our children Your
sons They are good boys They
shall raise their children right
A world full of good men Surely
that’s what The Creator wants

NOAH
I don’t know I don’t know what
he asks

Noah buries his face in his hands Naameh touches his

You can’t blame them for that

Ham and Japheth will survive the
deluge but they will survive

shears away wickedness That is
justice But in his right - a canopy
It shelters us from judgement and
creates a space for grace That is
mercy Which the Creator intends for
us now - that is a mystery

NAAMEH
So why won’t Noah strive for
mercy

METHUSALEH

The visions came to Noah The
choice is his

THE FOREST
Ila on all fours collects herbs into a satchel

She hears something flapping A pure white Dove
struggles to take flight with one dislocated wing

Ila scampers over She gently picks it up

ILA
Ah There you are

With a tender knowing touch Ila palpates the shoulder
joint before popping the wing back into the socket

She opens her hands The bird flies off towards the Ark
Then she spots something special a juicy berry

She plucks it It is delicious Then out of the corner
of her eye she sees another berry impossibly bloom

Intrigued she stares at it As she eats it another one
blooms nearby

She follows the trail of blooming fruit

DEEPER IN THE FOREST

Ila follows the stream of berries She is scared and
eurious at the game time

She watches as the trail blooms up Mt Ararat towards her

But the berries lead right inside

Slowly afraid she enters the darkness

Noah hammers busily He spots Ila’s Dove fly overhead
He watches the lonely Dove TWEET It leaps up and joins
it’s mate in the air

Noah watches them circle as the dark wet clouds churn
above

He sticks out his hands The birds land in his palms
He lets them touch beaks Then they fly into the Ark

DEEP IN THE FOREST

Shem freezes A strange noise approaches getting louder
from every direction White noise everywhere He runs
towards a lookout point

He arrives in time to witness the INSECTS of the world
descend igniting the massed hordes into chaos

METHUSALEH’S CAVE

Ila hears the noise She considers turning back but the
darkness calls her

DEEP IN THE FOREST
The insects fly past Shem shooting through the forest

We rush with them through the woods into the clearing
and stop when we see Noah

OUTSIDE THE ARK

The insects hang in the air before him They cover the
ground at his feet Noah bows

The bugs take his invite and rush into

THE ARK

The insects squeeze themselves into every unoccupied nook
and cranny under the legs of the crocodiles in the ears
of the elephants between the embrace of the cockatiels

until she sees the old man

He smiles at her Nervous she starts to back away

METHUSALEH
May I

Ila doesn’t know what he’s talking about She follows
his eyes to the berries in her hand

She holds them out and he takes one He smells it first
Then he pops it in his mouth rather quickly

It sends shivers of joy through his ancient body
METHUSALEH
Mmm Spring fruit Sweet and
fresh I’d almost forgotten

She offers him another He shakes his head no

She nods Slowly he extends wrinkled fingers towards her

The ancient fingertips hover quietly over her belly over
her scar over her womb

Suddenly the candlelight in the room surges with
brightness But only for a moment Was it the wind

Ila feels something inside She looks at the old man
afraid unsure She looks back down at her belly

She gets up terrified She looks at Methusaleh one more
time and runs

Methusaleh exhales It is done

soldiers The army counters and the masses scatter

As the crowd separates a familiar face — Ham Fighting
for his balance

A gang builds a raft Someone caught for stealing wood
They beat him Almost smash into Ham Ham scurries
away A ONE-EYED WOMAN spies him Something strange
about this one she thinks

Ham catches her one good eye and ducks behind a tent to

get away It is dark He hears crying Follows the
tears and slips into a muddy

GRAVE
Corpses all around Fresh not rotting yet

In front of him is a startled 13 year-old GIRL
o

GIRL
Get away

HAM
I’m sorry I won’t hurt--

She spins and picks up a rock ready to kill

GIRL
Leave

Ham retreats His back against the back of the grave

He looks at her She wipes her nose with the back of her
hand Tucks a curl behind her ear

She is small thin dirty And lovely

HAM
I have food

The girl is tempted for a moment Ham reaches into his
satchel Removes some flat-bread and dried fruit

HAM
Here
She moves for it but halts - suspicious
GIRL

What do you want

HAM
Nothing I will go

He reaches forward and holds it out to her
Fearfully she reaches out and takes it He retreats

The girl stuffs herself She watches him the whole time
never blinking He starts to climb away

GIRL
Are you alone

HAM
Yes You

She motions to the bodies Ham swallows

GIRL
I’m Na’eltamuk

HAM
Ham

NA’ELTAMUK
You’re kind Ham

She starts to cry He walks to her and sits down
She leans into him and sobs

CUT TO

THE ROOF

Noah hammers busily The sky is dark and black to the
horizon The clouds are furious

The air is filled with moisture A slight breeze blows
Suddenly all the noise of work around him stops He
looks up The Watchers put away their tools They climb
off the roof and sit down ina circle
OG

Only your work left then the Ark

is done
Og climbs down and joins his kind facing the woods

Noah looks down Only one nail is missing One last
nail and the Ark is finished

He opens his palm The nail is in his hand
He lines it up lifts the hammer and slams it in

The blow echoes

CUT TO

DEEP IN THE FOREST
Shem rushes through the woods calling for Ham
He smashes into Ila She smiles at him

SHEM
Tla Why are you--

Tla doesn’t listen just kisses him He pushes her back

SHEM
Ham we need--

She doesn’t stop She thrusts her tongue into his mouth

Shem tries to pull away She won’t slow down She rips
at his clothes her clothes

She takes his hand and thrusts it down Down where it
hurt

SHEM
But it hurts--

Not anymore Ila tells him so with a deep kiss

Shem forgets Ham the hordes of men the approaching
storm The whole world is Ila now

And Shem knew Ila
CUT TO

HIGH OVER THE EARTH

We fall quickly Gravity sucks on us Overrun now by a
cold fat single drop of water

Rain

Rushing down towards Noah’s upturned face Smash into
his waiting palm

Splash
Then three more drops hit nearby

CUT BACK TO THE

GRAVE
Ham and Na’eltamuk finish burying her family’s bodies

Exhausted he looks at her She smiles at him He smiles
and blushes

A rain drop hits her face The wetness lingers

Ham looks up A drop hits him in the forehead Another
drop then another

Ham realizes what it means He takes Na’eltamuk’s hand

HAM
Come Quickly now

CUT TO

THE FOREST

Through a screen of greenery Shem and Ila move together

At first only the sound of their rhythmic breathing then
the fluttering of rain on leaves is everywhere

As they settle into a climactic kiss water collapses
through the canopy and soaks them to the skin

cur TO

OUTSIDE THE ARK

Puddles form under the Watcher’s bums Og and Samyaza
sit side by side Rain water pours down their faces

SAMYAZA
Creator’s tears

BACK WITH

THE HORDES

Ham pulls Na’eltamuk into the surging masses The rain
has set-off hysteria The army shoots projectiles
blindly into the maddened crowd

Ham spots Akkad through the madness

HAM
We must get to my father
They scream to be heard over the rain and crowd
NA’ ELTAMUK
No there are soldiers that way
We should head towards safety to
the mountain
HAM
There is only one safe place The
great ship Father built it
Ham catches himself He spoke too loud

NA’ ELTAMUK
The Ark

He covers her mouth But it is too late

ONE-EYED WOMAN
I was right It’s one of them

She hits the WRINKLED MAN by her side

ONE-EYED WOMAN
The son The son of Noah

Her words echo through the crowd

REFUGEE 1 REFUGEE 2
Son of Noah Noah’s son Where

REFUGEE 3 REFUGEE 1
There There he is

And so on The crowd surges towards Ham and Na’eltamuk

CUT TO

THE EDGE OF THE FOREST
Shem and Ila burst out of the woods running for the Ark
Naameh spots them through the thick sheets of rain

NAAMEH
Shem Ila

Noah rushes past her out into the rain

SHEM
Father

NOAH
Where is your brother

Shem does not know

CUT TO

THE HORDES
Mayhem reigns

Knee deep in mud and soaked to the bone Ham and
Na’eltamuk run from the crowd

But they are surrounded Hands claw for them

REFUGEE 4
Ransom them

Ham hugs Na’eltamuk The surging crowd threatens to
crush them The girl screams out in agony and fear

As the end nears Ham closes his eyes to stop the pain
But then the crowd breaks apart Ham looks up

Akkad smashes his mount through the hordes and grabs Ham

The crowd holds onto Na’eltamuk Ham fights to get to
her but Akkad rides away

HAM
No No Let me go GO BACK

The great warrior sees the boy’s tears has mercy

AKKAD
Circle about Get the girl

Akkad leads a charge back into the masses his beast and
weapons chewing a line through the crowd

NA’ELTAMUK (0S)
HAM

Ham spots Na’eltamuk

HAM
There There

Akkad zeroes in on her He reaches down and yanks her
out of the crowd and into Ham’s arms

The hordes surge against Akkad’s beast The creature
cries out and smashes onto the ground its riders thrown
into the crowd

The mass surges after Ham Akkad tries to fight back but
there’s too many His men struggle for their own lives

Ham holds Na’eltamuk tight as the hordes descend

HAM
I’m sorry

Lighting flashes blinding everyone
A beat The rain slows down Everything slows down

The hordes turn as something huge bears down and smashes
them apart It is 0g Noah riding on his shoulders

Ten Watchers back them up Noah sees Ham screams to the
Watcher Magog

NOAH
Take him home

The crowd looks up at Og and Noah towering above them

REFUGEE 5 REFUGEE 6
It’s him Great mage

REFUGEE 7 REFUGEE 5
Noah Noah

Someone kneels bowing towards Noah The rest of the
masses follow suit They cry and beg for mercy

As Magog grabs Ham the boy clutches Na’eltamuk tight
Noah distracted by the crowd does not see the girl

Magog and three Watchers rush Ham and Na’elmatuk away

Akkad yanks one of his men off a mount He leaps onto
the beast trots through the bowing crowd

AKKAD
(to Noah)
Quickly WNow’s our chance

Noah throws Akkad a hard stare then shouts down at the
masses prostrated before him

NOAH
You had your warnings You heard
the Creator’s anger You ignored
them No one will be saved Not
one of you

Noah points at Akkad
NOAH
He was warned And he did
nothing Now - it is too late

AKKAD
Scoundrel

NOAH
Now justice shall reign

Part of the crowd begs for mercy as Og and the other
Watcher’s retreat Another part turns angrily to Akkad

Akkad rears his beast onto its hind legs
AKKAD
Fools Attack me and let him get
away We have only now We can
sit here and kill each other OR
WE CAN TAKE THE ARK

CUT TO

THE FOREST

Noah holds on tight to 0g As the Watchers sprint
through the forest they hear the hordes let out a blood
thirsty WAR CRY Og speeds up The hordes are coming

ENTRANCE TO THE ARK

Naameh stands just inside the Ark She scans the tree

line waiting The rest of the family -- Shem Ila and
Japheth -- by her side

Magog appears and rushes his two passengers to the Ark

Naameh hugs Ham She notices Na’eltamuk standing next to
him The girl stares at the hold filled with animals

HAM
This is Na’eltamuk She will be
my wife
Naameh smiles widely
NAAMEH

Thank you grandfather
Naameh grabs the girl hugs her

NOAH (0S)
Away from her

Noah stands outside in the rain

He boards the Ark grabs the girl out of his wife’s arms
and tosses her out of the Ark

Ham reaches out to save her but all he gets is a piece of
shirt Na’eltamuk lands in the mud

Instantly a Watcher picks her up and carries her off
towards the forest

Ham rushes after her But Noah grabs him He lifts him
up by both arms and stares into his eyes

NOAH
She will not come on the Ark
Join her and die with her Your
choice In or out

NAAMEH
Noah no

HAM
Please father

Noah swings back - about to throw Ham outside Ham
watches the girl disappear in the woods

The Watchers lift up the Ark door ready to seal it shut

NOAH
In or out

Ham bows his head In
Noah nods to the Watchers They seal the Ark

Noah releases Ham to sob in his mother’s arms and then
climbs up and out onto

THE ROOF OF THE ARK

Noah exits a hatchway and looks down into the clearing
The Watchers stand in the thigh-deep water They are
fanned out in a great circle surrounding the Ark

Akkad bursts into the clearing He meets Noah’s gaze

Then the army rushes in And the hordes behind them
10000 souls rushing for the safety of the ship

The Watchers meet the charge a different weapon in each
of their six arms It is an epic battle of man versus
giant

The Watcher Tabul grabs two soldiers He uses them to
smash other attackers away When the soldiers
disintegrate Tabul uses his mighty fists squashing his
opponents like a man splattering mice

The hordes overwhelm the Watcher Magog They pull him to
his giant knees and blind him But he keeps swinging and
killing until a few soldiers fire arrows into his throat

Magog falls down on his back into the water dead

The air around him bends A deafening CRACKLE sounds as
a single bolt of lightning strikes Magog’s body

The bolt hangs there like a rope of light connecting
earth to heavens And inside the bolt ascending through
the light Noah can almost see The Watcher writ in flame
a huge set of wings unfolding

And then the bolt is gone And so is Magog’s body
The Watchers witness Magog’s redemption Samyaza cries
out an unearthly roar of victory The other Watchers

join in It stuns the hordes

Samyaza and the others attack with abandon knowing their
redemption is secure The masses are pushed back

CUT TO

INSIDE THE ARK

Naameh tries to comfort Ham

NAAMEH
I am so sorry
HAM
She didn’t do anything She was
good
NAAMEH
I know
HAM
(snaps)
How would you know You know
nothing
NAAMEH

If Grandfather chose her then
HAM
I chose her I found her I
picked her
Ham runs off Naameh is confused Ila watches it all

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE ARK

The tide of the battle has changed again Too many
humans too few giants

Each time a Watcher falls a lightning bolt reclaims its
soul The surviving Watchers slowly retreat keeping the
circle tight

A large gang jumps onto Samyaza He takes a few of them
with him but a man drives a stake into his heart

He looks up to the heavens and whispers

SAMYAZA
My Creator have mercy on me

Og watches the bolt of lightning escort Samyaza home

A large group of men break through the opening in the
Watcher’s ranks They reach the scaffolding still

attached to the Ark and start to climb

On the roof Noah grips his axe tight Ready to fight

Og rushes to help He scampers up the scaffolding
tossing as many humans as he can back down

ON THE ROOF OF THE ARK

Og and Noah defend the ship slicing all enemies down
They push the scaffolding back dumping climbing men back
into the pit of humanity

For a moment the deck is clear The wind is violent

The clouds as black as night The rain hurts

Noah and Og stand side by side They watch the last
Watchers fall and the masses surge forward

OG
My end is near Watchers gave man
all our gifts All but one The
gift of forgetfulness

Og hands Noah a small wooden box

NOAH
Thank you Og
OG
I thank you Noah for helping us

go home
Then the great giant leaps off the Ark into the hordes

He kills many men Until Akkad emerges from the masses
Bloody on foot limping but alive

Akkad slings a rock at Og’s head The projectile slams
home and knocks the giant to his knees

Akkad leaps onto Og’s back and thrusts a great sword into
the base of the giant’s skull Akkad looks up at Noah as
he pulls the sword out

The air bends Lightning CRACKS and connects with 0g’s
falling corpse Akkad is thrown

Noah watches 0Og’s soul drift up to heaven
The last Watcher is gone and nothing protects the Ark

SMASH TO

SPACE

The planet Earth is covered in hurricanes A half dozen
giant Katrina’s rage across the globe Immense pinwheels
ripping apart our world

We fall back towards the ground through the clouds

BACK UP ON

THE ROOF OF THE ARK

The wind picks up Noah ties himself to the thick ropes
attached to the ship

Men climb the sides of the Ark

The fountain that first appeared over the seed Noah
planted years ago starts to bubble once again Then it
begins to spray as a great force pushes forth

The earth BREAKS open Water shoots up with unimaginable
pressure thousands of feet in the air

Other cracks release other bursting geysers Hundreds of
them maybe thousands Soon it is hard to tell if rain
is falling or shooting up

Men get shredded as pressurized water rips them apart
But more hordes approach

The wind nearly lifts Noah off his feet He struggles to
hold on Planks fly off the roof of the Ark Most men
are torn from the ship but some continue to climb
Twisters of wind and twisters of water connect cloud and
ground Men drown in droves But still the hordes

descend Thousands of people rushing through chest high
water to get to the ship

Suddenly the ground water sucks away Only muddy earth
As the desperate masses rush the Ark a two hundred foot
wall of water rears up behind him

Noah’s face fills with awe

CUT TO

METHUSLAEH’S CAVE
Methusaleh sits quietly eyes shut and breaths steady
Water floods his home He doesn’t stop breathing

Bubbles rush out he takes water in and death causes him
no pain

CUT BACK TO

THE ARK

The wall of water descends on the Ark The hordes that
haven‘t made it to the ship are destroyed

Their half-built ships explode into splinters

Just as the wave is about to hit the Ark it starts to
rotate into a huge whirlpool Towering walls of water
spin around the Ark

Akkad runs a step ahead of the tsunami an axe in each
hand He reaches the Ark just as the tidal wave hits the
corner of the boat and the whole Ark starts to spin
Round and round it rises up Akkad leaps - burying both
hatchets into the side of the Ark as the ship is lifted
up with the flood waters

Up on deck a dozen men have managed to hold on They
come at Noah from all sides He uses his long rope
tether to swing and dive across the pitching deck One
by one he cuts men down or flings them into the depths

Until finally Noah stands alone The ship stops
spinning It settles on the top of a great endless sea

Horror shock and sadness on Noah’s face as he stares at

the few screaming survivors sinking amongst the thousands
of floating dead

CUT TO

STORAGE ROOM
Ham sulks in a corner

He jumps when something hits the wall THWACK the tip of
a metal blade juts through the wood

Ham backs away afraid Just outside on

THE SIDE OF THE SHIP

Akkad hangs on for dear life He chops his way into

THE ARK

Hidden behind some supplies Ham watches the injured king
collapse unconscious in a puddle His leg is mangled

After a moment Ham slips away back to

THE HEARTH

Naameh holds onto Japheth She spots Ham and reaches out

‘for him He goes to her but says nothing Nearby Shem

holds Ila
The hatch above opens Everyone looks
It is Noah

He climbs down and looks at his family Japheth stares
at the axe in his hand Noah looks at it

It is covered in blood

Noah drags himself into his

WORKSHOP

He drops the axe next to his journals and notes

He opens Og’s box There is no ease for his pain and
sadness there Just a foot long tree branch A clipping
of sorts It looks dead Noah drops it as well

He collapses against the wall Alone he hangs his head

SLOW FADE TO

BLACK

Thunderous rain Thunderous storm Cries of the dying

And these words

Genesis 711
And that day were all the fountains of the great deep

burst forth and the windows of heaven were opened And
rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights

After a moment we return to

JAPHETH’S HUT
Japheth cuts a fifth line - day five - into the wall

CUT TOs

Ila and Naameh cook They hear someone cry for help
Maybe a lot of people

Ham and Japheth run in following the noise Ham runs to

NAAMEH

But Ham is already outside Naameh looks out
Horrified she turns back to Ila

NAAMEH

Keep him away
Ila pulls Japheth into his hut Naameh climbs outside

CUT TO

STORAGE ROOM

The screams wake Akkad from a feverish nap His wound is
bound Some water and food are set nearby

He looks around suspiciously No one He reaches for
the water and devours the food

CUT TO

UP NEAR THE ROOF

Shem and Noah work to patch leaks in the roof Sloshes
of sea water douse them with every sway of the boat

A desperate cry of human misery floats in from the rain
Shem looks at his father Noah acknowledges nothing

Shem goes to investigate Noah works for a beat Then
throws his tool to the ground and follows

CUT TO

ROOF OF THE ARK
Noah moves out onto the roof of the Ark

The rain whistles down on Shem Ham and Naameh
Neu”

They stare out at mountain tops the final remnants of
land They still tower over the Ark but not by much

Surviving hordes cling to ice covered rock They scream
for help The bravest swim for the Ark but the water is
too cold too rough

SHEM
If we cut loose the ropes let
them drag some might find safety

NOAH
We cannot help them

Ham looks at his father with fury He storms back into
the ship Naameh chases after him

SHEM
They’re not soldiers Just
people
Noah lets some time pass

NOAH
It is time to eat

Shem dutifully enters Noah pulls the roof hatch closed

CUT TO

THE HEARTH
The family reclines on low cushions and rugs for dinner

But only Noah and Japheth the youngest eat Everyone
else stares at their father their plates untouched

Noah finishes He gently places his plate down

NOAH
You stare at me as one stares at a
murderer

Noah looks up at his family

NOAH
You question if this old body has
a heart You wonder how one could
be so cruel

Noah looks directly at Ham Ham turns and starts to
leave

NOAH
Listen Listen to a story Our
family’s oldest story Listen
and then you judge

Ham stops he comes back sits down and waits for Noah to
start

Noah picks up the candle and blows it out Everything is

DARK

Just the sound of the rain and waves The occasional
human cry

Then we hear Noah’s voice

NOAH
In the beginning there was
nothing Nothing but the silence
of an infinite darkness

And now we hear nothing Silence Then

NOAH
But the breath of The Creator
fluttered upon the face of the
void whispering “Let there be
light”

A pinpoint of light explodes into our eyes

NOAH
And light was And it was good
And light separated itself from
darkness and darkness from light
And this was The First Day

And in what will be a single shot the white light starts
to undulate as darkness emerges and they battle like oil
and water

NOAH
And the formless light took on
substance and shape - and so the
glittering arches of the infinite
heavens were stretched across the
sky A Second Day

The light congeals into nebulae the nebulae into
galaxies We move forward into one galaxy the Milky Way
a trillion years ago

We approach a collapsing cloud of dust spinning around
its center The center IGNITES into a sun And the
edges clump into planets

We curve towards the third one circling the spinning
molten sphere until the young sun rises over the far side
of our home

NOAH
And Earth was born Our beautiful
fragile home A great warming
light nurtured it’s day - a sign
for seasons for days and years

Now a giant asteroid smacks into the planet knocking it
onto a slanted axis Every action creates an equal and
opposite reaction so a glob of cooling matter is knocked
off of the other side forming the Moon

NOAH
And a lesser light ruled the
night And there was Evening
And Morning Another day

We circle over the Earth until we break the cloud cover
soaring lower and lower over a planet that is completely
covered with liquid molten rock

NOAH
And the waters of the Earth
gathered unto themselves waters
unto waters And in their midst
emerged dry land And it was good
- for the land was rich and
fertile

We see the molten Earth form a dry crust Smaller
meteorites crash into the crust and spit up steam and
rain The water collects into great oceans and seas We
continue to soar high above the ground

NOAH
Another day passed And the Earth
put forth tender grasses seeds
trees fruit All the green and
growing things

And we see forests blooming and dying and blooming again
as the millennia rip by in seconds

Now we shoot into a pond The so-called primordial soup
of creation In the murky water we go microscopic We
see the first proteins forming We watch them dancing
around each other banging into each other until two of
them connect -- a key and lock They fold into each
other creating the first amino acids The chains growing
longer and more complex a helix appears a double helix
the birth of DNA

And we pull back revealing a nucleus inside of a single
celled PROTOZOAN now swinming with other protozoa
hundreds of them no maybe thousands tens of thousands

We follow one eating dividing becoming something else
something more complex more cells many cells the first
multi-celled invertebrate

NOAH
And the waters brought forth
swarms of living creatures

Soon there are vertebrates fish eels all life under
the sea We follow one creature and with each frame it
morphs into a new creature a distant descendent
evolving as time shoots by at unimaginable speeds This
evolving creature swims underwater dodging other evolving
creatures Above the surface of the water we catch
glimpses of dinosaurs ruling the planet

NOAH
The great monsters of the deep
that are no more

We dive deep into the coral-rich waters and pass by a
whale-like behemoth and alien squids from the deep sea
vents Then we begin to rise scattering schools of
gleaming fish

NOAH
And the multitudes of fish that
still swim beneath the seas
Soon too the fowls let fly upon
the face of the heavens And it
was good

And we burst out of the waters to see vast flocks of
birds swinging across the skies

NOAH
And there was evening And
morning A Fifth Day

And we still follow our direct ancestor as it slowly
crawls upon land The first mammals living between land
and sea We see the dinosaurs bloom and die Birds
multiply and fill the sky

NOAH
And the Earth brought forth the
living creatures each after its
kind Every thing that creepeth
And every thing that crawleth And
every beast that makes its way
upon the Earth

And still our ancestor evolves Moving away from the
water Up through the chain of mammals And soon our
distant primate fore-father swings through the trees
above the Earth Some form of monkey still evolving

And the forest is filled with monkeys cats sloths
butterflies snakes beetles slugs ants peacocks
porcupines and other creatures beyond number A dazzling
array of species A cornucopia of life-forms

NOAH
And it was good It was all good
There was light and air soil and
water All clean and unspoiled
There were plants and fish beast
and fowl Each one after their
kind all a part of the greater
whole All had their place and
all was in balance It was
paradise A jewel in The
Creator’s palm

Beat

NOAH
And then came Man

And we see now the first MAN ADAM walks the Earth He
glows with light so bright we can barely make out his
appearance or his nudity He walks through a forest

This is

EDEN
And by his side is EVE
NOAH
And by his side Woman Father and
mother of us all

She too glows with light She leaves Adam’s side as
she’s pulled towards a strange light

Through the woods in front of her are two trees glowing
with an internal magical light

There’s the Tree of Good and Evil and the Tree of Life

Eve is drawn to THE APPLE She stares at it And once
again it hangs before us from a quivering twig

Her hand reaches up and plucks the forbidden fruit
Behind us we hear the CRUNCH

And as this single shot ends all slips into darkness

BLACK

With Noah’s voice

NOAH
They ate from the forbidden fruit
Their innocence extinguished

RETURN TO

A HAND
Holds a stone Cain kills Abel

NOAH
Brother against brother Man
against the Earth

Back to

NOAH
We murdered each other We raped

us

Noah lights a match In

His family stares at him listening to his tale

NOAH
We are the last men and women to
walk the earth Children of Adam
and Eve Inheritors of sin But
we will not pass it on Shem and
Ila shall bury me and your mother

Naameh bows her head Tears in her eyes

NOAH
Ham shall bury them

Noah’s voice cracks Ham looks away not buying it

NOAH
Then Japheth will lay his older
brother to rest You Japheth
shall be the last man

(MORE )

NOAH (CONTD)
Until in time you too will return
to the dust No more men and no
More women will ever be The
creatures of the Earth the world
itself shall be safe

Shem and Ila hold hands tightly They understand

NOAH
I wish no man harm No woman
Each death grieves my heart But
we must weigh those lives against
all creation No matter how
painful we must carry this out

Naameh reaches out to touch Noah’s arm
Japheth stares up at him with wide open eyes

Noah looks to Ham reaches out a hand Ham just stares back
NOAH
I’m sorry for her For you I
AMe es

Ham turns away leaves the room

NOAH

ILA
I’ll talk to him

As Ila leaves Naameh holds her husband tight
NAAMEH

It was a hard thing what you did

All those souls It’s done now

It’s done
And in the grip of his wife’s forgiveness and
understanding Noah’s body starts to shake Months of icy
determination melting into release

You helped me

Akkad nods He releases Ham

Akkad nods Ham gingerly nibbles at the meat It is
delicious A revelation

He grabs the meat and starts to eat

NOAH’S WORKSHOP

Waameh walks in and sees Noah sifting through bottles and
vials of herbs looking for something that might help

NAAMEH
Two weeks now she has been ill

NOAH
It doesn’t make sense

Noah absently pulls out a vial He looks at it It will
not help He starts to put it back He hesitates

NOAH
Unless

An idea But it can’t be But then again maybe

NAAMEH
What

NOAH
Couldn’t be--

Noah grabs the vial scrambles for a few other items

NAAMEH
What is it

Noah doesn’t answer Driven now he rushes out into

Ham and Akkad talk
AKKAD
Your father is a strong man I am
injured We have one advantage -

Akkad ducks behind a wall He lifts up the sharpened awl

AKKAD
One blow and it will be done

HAM
(afraid)
I do not know--
Akkad flashes with anger
AKKAD
Decide now once and for all Are
you a man If you are then you
can kill
Ham seems unsure A lizard scurries through the room

Ham chases after it into the

ANIMAL QUARTERS
He corners the lizard and grabs it He heads back

HAM
It’s my brother’s-

As he enters the

STORAGE ROOM
Akkad holds his hand over Japheth’s mouth

Ham drops the lizard The pet scurries away

HAM
Let him go

AKKAD
He will give us away

HAM
He won’t Let him go

Quiet Japheth He is a friend
Akkad lowers his hand But Japheth can tell something is wrong

JAPHETH
FATHER

Akkad covers the boys mouth Japheth bites into him

Akkad lifts Japheth over his head ready to crush him
against the wall of The Ark

Ham swings an awl into Akkad’s bad leg drawing blood
Akkad in pain drops Japheth Ham grabs his younger
brother’s hand and rushes through the

What is it
Noah doesn’t answer
SHEM
Father
NAAMEH

How could it be

NOAH
(to Ila)
Give me your finger

Ila looks to her father for an explanation None comes
She gives him her hand Noah pricks her finger Blood
bubbles onto her fingertip

He drips blood into the bowl He watches the blood drop
diffuse turning the water a pale red

Noah and Naameh stare into the bowl waiting anxiously

Noah and Shem march past the sleeping cargo into the

Shem spots a blood trail They follow it a few feet and
it stops

A drip hits the ground They both look up It’s coming
from up above towards the roof

CUT TO
ILA’S HUT
In the test bowl the pale red water slowly turns yellow

Naameh cannot believe her eyes Then she figures it out

NAAMEH
You saw grandfather

Ila grasps to understand

NAAMEH
What did he do to you

ILA
Why Nothing

NAAMEH

Daughter you are not sick

You are pregnant

ROOF OF THE ARK
The deck is covered with a sheen of black ice
Hail and sleet thunder down on the dark sea

Shem climbs out first Akkad is waiting He smashes him
in the head with a plank The young man goes down

Noah leaps onto Akkad Akkad is ready His dagger cuts
into Noah’s stomach But Noah’s force smashes both men
into the hard deck Weapons are knocked free and slip
into the sea

Noah shoots away nursing his wound

AKKAD
You lied to me You cheated me You
cheated the human race I should have
killed you a long time ago

NOAH
You were too busy leading your
people astray
AKKAD
(sarcastic)
You are a shining example of
paternal leadership
(firm)
Your own son hates you and wishes
to betray you ‘

Noah’s eyes tighten He reaches for Akkad’s bison-horn
medallion and rips it from his neck

Akkad leaps and tackles Noah The horn slips from his
hand The enemies wrestle on the icy deck

A brutal fight to the finish

At the edge of the roof Akkad breaks free He kicks
Noah in the face Noah slips off the side of the ship

But he grabs the slippery ledge
He hangs for dear life as the ice cold sea laps at his feet

Naameh dumps the yellow liquid out the side of the Ark

ILA
But it is his grandchild

NAAMEH
You’ve heard his beliefs You
know his conviction His
stubbornness

ILA

Then what will we do

NAAMEH
He must not know We have to hide
it

ILA

On this Ark How How can I hide
life inside me from father

NAAMEH
Start by hiding your tears
(then )
Your blood betrayed you So we
will give you mine
Naameh reaches for the blade Noah used to draw blood

CUT TO

THE EDGE OF THE ARK’S ROOF
Akkad smirks at Noah who clings for his life
AKKAD
Know this as you die first I will
kill your sons Then I will take
your wife your daughter I will
sire a whole new army with an
entire world at our mercy
Akkad lifts his leg poised to crush Noah’s fingers

When suddenly he stops Blood trickles out of his
mouth

He falls forward over Noah into the freezing sea

UNDERWATER
His death complete

BACK UP ON

Ham now a man stands over Noah with the weapon that
murdered Akkad It was the bison horn

Noah hangs from the edge his strength slipping
Ham just watches

HAM
She was innocent father She was
good
He drops the horn into the sea and turns away

Shem rushes up conscious now

SHEM
Ham father Help him

Ham doesn’t help He keeps going
Shem pulis Noah up

Noah catches his breath as Shem notices the blood from
his father’s side

SHEM
You’re hurt

Shem starts to apply pressure Noah pushes Shem away and
rushes through the rain back into the Ark

curt TO

ILA’S HUT

Naameh has filled the bowl with water and herbs again
She takes the blade and cuts her own finger

As she squeezes a drop of her blood into the bowl Noah
enters soaked and dripping

NOAH

Ila stands up She stares at her father A protective
hand slides across her belly

Shem enters and notices Ila’s hand

Shem comes to her

Naameh tries to change the subject
“Bice

It is true isn’t it

Ila can’t lie

ILA
It’s a miracle father A
blessing

SHEM

What is going on

NOAH
Nooooo

Noah smashes the bowl and storms out
Ila smiles through her tears at Shem

ILA
You are to be a father

Shem is deeply shocked worried But as he walks towards
Ila joy bubbles up through his concern

SHEM
It cannot be must not be The
Creator’s plan father’s
work We mustn’t we are the
last No babies
He reaches Ila touches her bursts with love

SHEM
Our baby

CUT TO

THE HEARTH

Noah wrecks the room He stomps around smashing all in
sight Then he collapses to the ground and starts to
ery At first small tears Then deep sobs

And as he cries the world shifts The rain starts to
slow At first we hear it The pounding of water on
wood we’ve heard since the flood began starts to lighten
Then we see it out the hatch The rain just disappears

CUT TO

ILA’S HUT
Shem kisses Ila’s belly Her tears slow

And then a deafening silence as 40 days of drumming rain
suddenly ceases They rush into

THE HEARTH

Everyone crowds around the hatchway staring out at the

ROOF OF THE ARK
Noah stands in the cool dry air staring at the horizon

SHEM
Father

Noah turns to look at his family His tears are gone

SHEM
The rains have stopped The
Creator smiles on our child
Won’t you bless us too

A long beat

NOAH
The rains have stopped because of
your child yes And if itisa
boy it shall receive my blessing
He will take Japheth’s place the
last man

Noah pushes past them into the Ark He pauses

NOAH
But if it is a girl a nascent
mother then it must die

SHEM
Are you mad This is my child

NOAH
Should you bear a girl - in the
moment of her birth I will cut her
down

Ila screams in horror

Noah collapses to one knee Then he crumples to the
ground Quickly everything

FADES TO BLACK

Once again we hear CRIES SHOUTS SCREAMS of death war

It bangs

NOAH

Into consciousness for a moment Then he slides back
into the throes of his own personal fever

NOAH
No Please no

Naameh tends him But even she can’t stop him from

FADING INTO BLACKNESS

And these words emerge

Genesis 717
And the waters prevailed so mightily upon the Farth that
all the high mountains under the whole heaven were
covered All in whose nostrils was the breath of life

had died Only Noah remained alive and they that were
with him in the Ark

NAAMEH
There you are Feeling better

Noah is Then he remembers Ila He sits up quickly

said I told her it was the
fever
Noah looks at his wife He is completely serious

NOAH
You know it was not

Naameh’s face falls She dared hope but she knew

planning He yanks a plank up off of the Ark

Ila just stares out All still covered with sea

Naameh offers him the food

NAAMEH

He does not take it

NAAMEH

You have not eaten in weeks

How can I
NAAMEH

You could relent

Do I Look Look out at our world
Noah points to edge of the Earth

NAAMEH
I don’t see anything

NOAH
Exactly And you won’t until Ila gives
birth The rain stopped months ago
Yet the waters remain Why Because
He must be sure the new world will be
as He intends That I will do what I
must do If you love them do not let
them go There is no land They will
die out there

Noah tosses his plate of food into the sea

NAAMEH
How can you be sure

creatures Japheth behind him

Noah climbs up until he finds the sleeping ravens He
peels the male RAVEN from its mate

It sleeps in his arms as he pets it

With a stone flint he shoots a spark onto the herbal mix
It smokes as it burns Noah blows a thin stream of smoke
into the Raven’s nostrils

Slowly the Raven wakes The Raven SQUAWKS

Noah carries it back to

THE HEARTH

His family looks at them The Raven SQUAWKS again

HAM
What do you want

NOAH

The raven Perhaps The Creator’s most
intelligent winged creature And keen
eyesight to match If there is land
out there — he will find it
Ila and Shem look at each other

Noah walks out Everyone but Ham follows him out onto

THE ROOF OF THE ARK

Noah raises the bird out on an outstretched hand He
shoots it off into the air The Raven takes flight

It circles the Ark once and then flaps off to a distant
horizon

FADE TO BLACK

Looking back at the Ark No rain No wind No waves
Air sea and sky all gray and still and flat

Rising up off the water the Raven shoots past us

He senses something looks up The Raven approaches

JAPHETH

Everyone rushes out Ila carries a huge weight and is
extremely tired

Noah walks to the edge of the roof and stretches out his
hand The Raven lands on his forearm It blinks

He examines its feet

bends to pick it up but the big black bird snaps at him

She swallows a cry of pain Terror lights her eyes

Shem is bewildered He reaches to pick it up when
another fish leaps on board

Beat

Ten more jump on board Then a whole school
He panics

Get back
He looks over the side of the boat

From the dark purple sea a shape rises towards him

He leaps for the pulley ropes just as a giant ORCA
smashes through the bow of the escape boat

A pod of whales follow close behind cresting out of the
sea everywhere reducing the raft to splinters

Shem safely hangs on a rope He scampers up into

THE HEARTH
Ila hugs him He hugs back Scared

The whales cry out as if talking to Noah Shem sees his
father watching His anger grows but

JAPHETH (0S)
The Dove The Dove

From

THE ROOF OF THE ARK
They hear Japheth scream Everyone rushes outside

The exhausted bird fights to maintain altitude It
sinks almost hits the water then fights to get air

As it gets closer a wind picks up Ila’s hair blows in
the gust The still waters of the sea are pushed into
choppy foam

The Dove is buoyed the last few yards towards the Ark
It collapses onto the deck Japheth rushes over

He picks up the bird It pants its chest heaves He
examines the feet Clean no mud Nothing there

Ila reads her young brother’s body language

impact Noah is ready He spins around blocks the
weapon twists his son’s wrist tosses him to the ground
With Shem’s pole he trips Ham and pins him down
Noah plants a knee onto the center of Shem’s chest
He stares into his son’s helpless eyes

if it is a girl it must die

Noah tosses Shem aside and disappears into his workshop

Then he spots his father Noah stands silently on the
j other side of the wall of spears
NOAH
Son Let me pass

SHEM
I will not
NOAH
I do not wish to harm you
SHEM
It is my baby
NOAH
It threatens every creature on
this boat
SHEM

It You mean your grandchild My
first born Just leave us be

Noah almost grins
And then we hear a newborn CRY

Noah gets extremely serious He shuts his eyes A
moment of reflection Then he looks at his son

NOAH
Please You cannot stop us

Shem excited by the sound of fatherhood responds by
unleashing a sword

SHEM
(unsure)
Us
But Noah has retreated into the darkness of the Ark

CUT TO

BIRTHING HUT

Naameh smiles broadly as she hands the newborn baby to
her mother Ila sobs

BACK IN THE

STORAGE ROOM
Shem watches the hallway not sure where Noah went
He nervously screams into the lean-to

SHEM
Is it a boy What is it

INSIDE THE
Ree”

BIRTHING HUT
Ila looks up at Naameh - what is it
NAAMEH
(to Ila)
I didn’t look

And Naameh peeks beneath the blanket keeping the baby
warm We do not see the sex but by the look on Naameh’s
face the news is not good

ILA
(gasps)
Oh no
Naameh tries to lie the best she can
NAAMEH

(shouting to Shem)
It’s a boy

SHEM’S FORT

Shem can barely believe his ears

SHEM
A boy A boy

NAAMEH (0S)
Yes a boy

Shem sees Noah approaching down the hall

SHEM
It is a boy Stop It is a boy

But Noah strides forward And now Shem hears the sounds
of the Ark awakening behind him

CUT TO

ANIMAL QUARTERS

We watch the creatures rise from their slumber They
stumble to their hooves their paws their flippers

Eyes open they stretch and yawn and let out their
morning cries

BACK UP IN
a“

THE STORAGE ROOM
Noah pushes forward
Ham watches from his hiding place

As Noah passes Ham rises up murderous AWL in hand The
blade rushes down towards the back of Noah’s head

This is not about stopping Noah Not about saving the
baby This is about hatred and revenge

HAM
AHHHHHH

But from the darkness of the Ark something comes

Two hulking three-horned RHINOS charge Ham One tosses
Ham into a wall He collapses out cold

The Rhinos charge on They smash apart Shem’s wall of
spears but the trap surprises them They tumble down
into the pit of spikes Their species forever extinct

Just on the tail of the rhinos is a myriad of species two
by two They storm the fortress

The BIRDS and BATS and flying INSECTS reach Shem first
He swings at them but they teem about confusing and
disorienting him

Shem’s swinging traps impale one of two giant predator
CATS The other one leaps onto Shem’s chest

Shem pulls out a new blade and stabs the cat in its
lungs He tosses the carcass aside

Noah moves forward surrounded by the swarm of creatures
attacking Shem

SHEM
IT’S A BOY A BOY STOP

Noah keeps coming Shem pulls a trigger unleashing darts
and arrows at Noah The flying creatures sacrifice
themselves Many die Noah keeps walking

Two SPOTTED WOLVES charge Shem retreats into

THE BIRTHING HUT

And he sees his beautiful child for the first time But
something is wrong Ila and Naameh are both crying
eed

ILA
Isn’t she beautiful

SHEM
She

For a moment he chokes up

As he pulls himself together and hoists another weapon
the hut is yanked apart

Two giant RIDGE-BACKED PRIMATES rip the hut to pieces
The morning glow from outside shines on Ila and the
child

The primates descend on Shem and push him to the ground

The wolves growl at and bite Shem until all he can do is
crawl up into a defensive ball in the corner

Noah stops before Ila Naameh pounds on his chest

NAAMEH
It’s a boy for mercy’s sake A BOY

Noah lowers his sobbing wife to the floor Two giant
FANGED HOGS pin her gently to the ground

And now there’s just Noah and Ila

Ila shivers in the dawn The pain of childbirth still
rattles her inner core She holds the baby tight

NOAH
Is it a girl

Ila can’t lie She tears up

ILA
Please father

NOAH
I am sorry

The snakes on board hiss in They grab her limbs and
tighten spreading her down to the ground

Shem tries to do something but he is beaten back by the
living breathing animals wandering everywhere

Ila is pinned

ILA
No No

Noah takes the child His grandchild He undresses her
It is a girl Tears in his eyes He swallows them down

NOAH
I am sorry daughter I am so
sorry

He turns his back to Ila He takes a deep breath

ILA
I beg you please I beg you--

He pulls out his dagger

ILA
Ple-- Ahhhh

Ila screams Noah lifts the blade then stops
Something is wrong Ila cries from pain not anguish

He looks back at her

NOAH
What

Naameh realizes first

NAAMEH
Another A twint A twin

Noah looks at the baby in his arm He looks at the
blade He does not know what to do The snakes let her
loose Noah moves towards Ila

ILA
Get away from me You monster
Away

She tries to back away A wall of pain hits Ila she
nearly passes out

NAAMEH
Let me help her

Noah looks at the pigs They release Naameh
She crawls to Ila

NOAH
A boy Please a grandson

NAAMEH
It‘s coming

And Ila pushes hard Shem cries

NOAH
Please Please Please
aes

Naameh pulls the baby out And she starts to sob Noah
looks at Naameh he understands

But he forces the tears down He reaches down and takes
the second newborn child He holds both babies in one
arm They wail relentlessly Their screams are
piercing

He picks them up and walks out of the room
Ila reaches for him but she is exhausted too weak to stand

CUT TO

THE ROOF OF THE ARK

Noah walks to the edge of the Ark and stares out at the
sea The clouds are dark and gently churning

NOAH
Forgive me

He collects himself and pulls out the blade The knife
hesitates and vibrates in the air

The babies scream and scream and scream

ILA (quietly and gently)
Father

He turns and sees his daughter She stands behind him
Weak but firm

NOAH
Please child Go You don’t need
to see this

Ila drags herself forward step by step

NOAH
(gently)
You cannot stop me

Tla is close now She looks at the screaming wailing
children in her father’s arms

ILA
They’re crying Don’t let them
die crying Please I can’t stop
you I won’t Just- let me hold
them Calm them for a moment
Please Let them die calm

Noah looks at Ila She is telling the truth The
children wail uncontrollably

ILA
Let them know a moment of peace

Noah nods Ila steps forward and takes the children
She holds the twins tightly

Shem and Naameh stumble onto deck and stare With the
babies in her arms Ila drops to her knees She stares
down at them rocking slowly back and forth Laughing
crying

And then Ila starts to hum

Her voice rises up from a place of comfort so deep she
doesn’t know its source And she starts to sing

ILA
Sleep my child
Surrender to the wild
Find your breath
Find your peace
Sleep my child
Surrender to the wild
Find your breath
Find your peace

Noah recognizes the song It is the same tune he sang to
his children The same tune he sang to Ila as a little
girl when her belly was bleeding and full of fear

The song calmed Ila then and it calms her daughters now
She rocks and sings The infants whimper and soon they
fall silent Calm and at peace they stare up at their
mother

Tears stream down her face Ila holds out her arms to
Noah She offers up the quiet babies to his dagger

ILA
Do it now Do it quickly

Noah looks down at his daughter kneeling before him
offering her children willing to hold them and watch
them die in her arms rather than let them suffer

She looks up at Noah with a pleading face A tear in her
eye refracts sunlight A rainbow in a drop of salty
water as it beads and falls

Noah turns and looks at the skies His eyes narrow from
the brightness The clouds have finally separated and
blue sky pokes through

He watches as a rainbow emerges out from this air

Red orange yellow green blue indigo violet stretch
down from the heavens into the shining sea

The knife drops It clangs against the floor of the Ark
Ila looks up She sees her broken father Crying
NOAH
(to himself to the Creator)
Iocan’t I can’t do it I am
sorry I am so sorry

Ila hugs the babies against her bosom Shem holds tight
onto his woman and children

Naameh reaches out for Noah but he stumbles off
And then Japheth comes running

JAPHETH
There There There she is

Everyone looks
It is the Dove He flies straight and strong
Japheth holds out his hand

The Dove lands in his palm In its beak an olive twig
green leaves white flowers

JAPHETH
Land He found it

Ila smiles at her younger brother

ILA
Yes He found it

Behind her entering

THE DARK ARK
Goes Noah He heads into the belly of the ship
His family celebrates behind him

CUT TO

NOAH’S WORKSHOP

Noah closes the door in his workshop Defeated He sits
heavily

He cries out in anguish and punches the air

Og’s box falls by itself to the floor It smashes open
and the old gnarled branch rolls to Noah’s feet

The branch has new life Fresh green leaves have
sprouted from the old grey wood

SLOW FADE TO

FORESTED MOUNTAIN

The same gnarled branch Now the root of a huge grape
vine teeming with fruit Butterflies bees and
hummingbirds buzz around it

A foot steps in front

It is Ham’s foot

Ham wears a big pack It looks like he is heading off on
a long trip

He looks around him There is a grape arbor And a wine-
press Some empty jugs

He holds a knife in his hand
CUT TOs

EDEN

Or what Eden must have been like in its first moments of
creation

The waters have retreated The Ark leans against a
mountain top decaying The sides of the Ark have been
ripped down

Animals roam freely Birds fill the sky

A new forest has taken seed The buds of an approaching
Spring burst forth boldly from young trees

A small camp around a small fire

Ila and Shem hold the young twins They are wrapped warm
from the dissipating cold Japheth is fascinated with
the girls

Naameh is busy working cooking She looks up concerned

NAAMEH
Ham

CUT TO

FORESTED MOUNTAIN

Ham looks down in the grass at his father Noah is
drunk and naked surrounded by empty jugs

He shivers wakes
He spots his middle son He reaches out for him

NOAH
Ham

Ham looks down at his father with anger and bitterness
He grips the knife in his hand

Then Noah passes out again A sad and drunken man
Ham’s grip on the knife loosens He puts it away
He drops something on Noah’s naked chest

It is the scrap of cloth from Na’elmatuk’s shirt

Ham looks around again He shoulders his pack and walks
off He isn’t coming back

CUT TO

THE SMALL CAMP
Shem and Naameh talk

NAAMEH
Better check up there

SHEM
With father It’s the last place
Ham would go

NAAMEH
Still Better look
ILA
I will go
Shem looks surprised
ILA

It’s time I went Saw him
Shem nods He understands

CUT TO
Mewar

FORESTED MOUNTAIN

Noah is awake now Sitting up His naked back to us
Ila approaches He senses her but does not look

She covers him with a blanket She pulls it around him
He looks’ at her Doesn’t know what to say

ILA
They’re looking for Ham

Noah shows her the scrap She knows what it means

NOAH
Gone
Silence for awhile
NOAH
Ila I
ILA

There is no need to say anything
I understand

NOAH
I have failed Him All this I
was too weak to save it

ILA
Is that what He tells you

NOAH
He does not speak to me anymore

Silence for a long beat as father and daughter sit side
by side

ILA
They are beautiful girls They’d
like to know their grandfather
I’d like them to

NOAH
After what I tried to do

ILA
Yes I think you have a lot to
teach them About the world
around them and how to live in it
Maybe if you give them your wisdom
they will do better with their
world then we did with ours
(Y

NOAH
Maybe

A moment for father and daughter
The sun hangs low in the sky It will be dark soon

CUT TO

THE SMALL CAMP
Ila and Noah stand looking down on the camp Naameh
Japheth and Shem play with the little twins It is an
idyllic scene
Ila starts down Noah pauses
She looks back at her old father for a long beat
She holds out her hand to him
He hesitates
Then takes it
FADE TO BLACK

And these words to end

GENESIS 9

And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them “Be
fruitful and multiply and fill the earth

And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on
every beast of the earth and every bird of the air on
all that move on the earth and all the fish in the sea

Unto your hand are they delivered”

Return to darkness and the end
