CUT TO

EXT US ARMY CAMP - NORTH CAROLINA - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

as “TAPS” plays its haunting C Major triad signalling
“lights out” and the LIGHTS wink out in the WINDOWS of
a dozen BARRACKS

INT BARRACKS - SAME
as the LIGHTS GO OUT on
MARCUS MACAULEY a handsome young man lying on the bottom bunk of one of
a dozen BUNK BEDS

He’s been reading a letter from home and now must angle
it to catch the MOONLIGHT fighting through the window
nearest his bunk

Satisfied he grins
It’s a gentle wise secret grin which seems to say Yes
to all things

He folds the letter tucks it back into its envelope and
slides it under his pillow as the final note of “TAPS”
fades away into the night

MARCUS
Homer got a job

The CREAK of the wooden slats of the upper bunkand
TOBEY GEORGE - a RED-HEADED young PRIVATE - leans over the edge of the
upper bunk looks (upside down) at Marcus and asks
TOBEY

MARCUS
No The youngest one’s Ulysses
How the heck is he gonna get a job
TOBEY
What’s he like

CUT TO

ULYSSES MACAULEY (AGE 4)

- a wide-eyed wonder of a little boy dressed in overalls
with one busted shoulder strap and leaning over to stare at

A GOPHER
peeking out from its hole

For an instant these two round-eyed creatures stare at
one another before the smallest of the two suddenly
disappears back down his hole Something is wrong

And Ulysses looks down at the ground all around him It
is tremblingwe are

EXT MACAULEY HOME - BACKYARD - DUSK

and Ulysses turns his back on the gopher-hole the old
TWO-STORY SHINGLED HOUSE the WALNUT TREE and the CHICKEN
COOP and starts to run - to squeeze through a gap in the
backyard FENCE - and to dash as fast as his short little
legs can carry him across

EXT VACANT LOT - CONTINUOUS

And Ulysses speeds across this weed-infested junky
wonderfully empty field as the CAMERA PULLS BACK and
CRANES UP to reveal
EXT ITHACA CALIFORNIA - DUSK

a small town of ROW CROPS VINEYARDS and ORCHARDS in
the heart of California’s Central Valley And in the
distance

A FREIGHT TRAIN
is coming We can hear its WHISTLE before we

CUT TO

EXT RAILROAD CROSSING - MOMENTS LATER

as Ulysses arrives breathless and just in time Here
the ground is positively shaking

Ulysses waves at the ENGINEER in the speeding
LOCOMOTIVE but the man ignores him

And as the BOXCARS and FLATCARS roar by Ulysses waves

to the STOKERthe BRAKEMANthe CARMANand to a
HOBO riding for free But none of them wave backuntil

A BLACK MAN

appears leaning over the side of a GONDOLA CAR
and singing
BLACK MAN

Weep no more my lady O weep no

more today We will sing one song

for the old Kentucky home For

the old Kentucky home far away
And Ulysses waves to him and he waves back And he

SHOUTS over the clatter and roar of the train
BLACK MAN (CONT’ D)

GOIN’ HOME BOY GOIN’ BACK WHERE
I BELONG

And long before Ulysses can make sense out of this
statement the freight train has passed Its CABOOSE is
already disappearing in the distance as Ulysses smiles

It’s a gentle wise secret smile which seems to say Yes
to all things

CUT TO
EXT MACAULEY HOME - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

as Ulysses squeezes through the gap in the fence and runs
across the backyard - trips and falls picks himself up
and moves to stand next to his mother

MRS MACAULEY a beautiful if life-worn widow She is throwing feed to
the CHICKENS in the coop as Ulysses sidles up next to her
ULYSSES

Where’s Marcus
Mrs Macauley musters a patient smile This isn’t the
first time for the following litany
MRS MACAULEY
Marcus has gone away from Ithaca
ULYSSES
Why
MRS MACAULEY
Marcus is in the Army
ULYSSES
When is he coming home
MRS MACAULEY
When the war is over
ULYSSES
Tomorrow
MRS MACAULEY
No Not tomorrow And we don’t
know when We’re waiting
ULYSSES

If we waitwill my father
come home like Marcus too

This catches Mrs Macauley off guard

MRS MACAULEY
No Ulysses Your father will not
come home the way he used to He
won’twalk down the streetand
climb the stepsand cross the
porch and come into the house the
way he used to
ULYSSES
Why
And Mrs Macauley sets aside her bag of chicken feed and

hikes up her apron and lowers herself down to look at
her little son eye to eye and on his own level

MRS MACAULEY
Because every life ends

And Mrs Macauley bound and determined to continue to tell

her son the truth until he can comprehend it states simply

MRS MACAULEY (CONT’D)
Your father’s life ended two years
ago But he is with us still
Because you and I and Marcus and
Homer and your sister Bess
remember him His goodness is with
us because it is in youand in
Marcusand in Homerand in
Bess Goodness never ends

Ulysses blinks at this informationthen

ULYSSES
Where is Homer

MRS MACAULEY

Homer is working He found himself
a job after school He will be
home after midnight when you are
in bed asleep

ULYSSES
Why is Homer working

MRS MACAULEY
He is working because Marcus is in
the Army and we must have money
to buy food and clothing and pay
rentand to give to others

ULYSSES

Who
MRS MACAULEY
The poor

ULYSSES
Who’re the poor
MRS MACAULEY
Everybody You must remember
always to give - of everything
you have And the more you give
the more you will have to give

And Ulysses blinks a couple of times then moves to
the chicken coop and starts looking for something

And Mrs Macauley lifts her bag of feed and scatters it
for the birdsand glances at the BACK PORCH where

MATTHEW MACAULEY (AGE 47)

- her dead husband in the prime of his life - stands
smiling at her

A tug on her apron pulls her attention to Ulysses
holding up a fresh CHICKEN EGG

And we CUT WIDE as Mrs Macauley accepts her son’s
solemn offeringto REVEAL that there is in fact NO
ONE standing smiling on the back porchand

THE SOUND OF SINGING
PRE-LAPS our

WIPE TO
HOMER MACAULEY (AGE 14)

on the seat of a second-hand bicycle and wearing a
POSTAL TELEGRAPH MESSENGER’S COAT which is far too big
and a MESSENGER’S CAP which is far too small and
SINGING at the top of his lungs a ridiculous operatic
song of his own invention as he races along

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK
and past a VINEYARD

Homer is the very picture of reckless youthful
exuberance and his own comic opera is practically
bursting from his chest as he powers down the dirt
roadlooks up at the dusky skyand sees

THREE AIRPLANES

flying overhead

And he promptly runs off the road and into a ditch
It’s an accident that would send a grown man to the
hospital But Homer is a boy and though momentarily
dazed considers his fall as a source of amusement rather
than a corporeal concern
He looks to his bicycle - upside down with its front
wheel still spinning - and asks it
HOMER

Are you okay
He scrambles to his feet and rights the bike and gives it
a once-over as

A DOG
barking furiously emerges from a VINEYARD ROW and makes
a vicious bee-line for him

And Homer jumps back on the bicycle and pedals away
with the dog in hot pursuit And Homer turns and barks
back at the dog and LAUGHS with sheer delight

Homer Macauley age 14 is out of school for the day
and heading for the first shift of his first job

EXT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

As the dog tires of the chase and slows to a trot Homer
puts his hand out and slaps a SIGN as he passes it
Ithaca California

East West - Home Is Best
Welcome Stranger

A CONVOY OF US ARMY TRUCKS

turns a corner and heads out of town

And Homer stops pedalling and salutes

THE SOLDIERS

as they pass byand many of them return his salute

CUT TO

A CLOCK

as it clicks to 702 It is displayed in the WINDOW of
EXTINT POSTAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE - NIGHT

as Homer jumps off his bicycle leans it against the

wall and enters the old telegraph office to see

SPANGLER - the kind-looking manager of the telegraph office -
counting the words of a telegram form which has just

been handed to him by
A NERVOUS YOUNG MAN fidgeting at the counter

SPANGLER
Fourteen words collect

The Young Man hesitatescoughs

SPANGLER (CONT’D)
Little short of money

YOUNG MAN
A littlebut my mother’11l send me
enough to get home on How long’1l
it take the telegram to get to her

SPANGLER

It’s pretty late in the East And
it’s not easy to raise money late
at night but I’1l rush it through

While Homer watches Spangler reaches into

his own

pockets pulls out a handful of COINS and a single piece

of CURRENCY which he hands to the Young Man
YOUNG MAN
What’s this
SPANGLER

It’s nothing It’s just in case
You can pay me back when your
mother sends the money

The Young Man is amazed Embarrassed

YOUNG MAN
Thanksuhmthanks

He turns and hurries past Homer and out of the office
and Homer watches as Spangler hands the telegram form to

WILLIAM GROGAN - the aged night-shift telegraph operator sporting an
old-fashioned green eye-shade cap
SPANGLER
Send it paid Willie
And Spangler drops presses a lever on the CASH REGISTER -
CHUH-CHING - and drops a couple of coins in the tray
And Grogan puts his hand around the TELEGRAPH KEY or “bug”

and rattles off the telegram letter by letter DASH DASH
DIT DASH DIT DIT DIT DITas the CAMERA SCANS the

HANDWRITTEN POSTAL TELEGRAPH FORM

MRS MARGARET STRICKMAN
1874 BIDDLE STREET
YORK PENNSYLVANIA

DEAR MA PLEASE TELEGRAPH THIRTY DOLLARS WANT TO COME HOME AM FINE
EVERYTHING OK
JOHN

Spangler leans against the inside edge of the counter
and watches Homer watching Grogan

SPANGLER

So Remind me Why do you want to
be a messenger

Homer is momentarily caught off guard then

HOMER

Because I’ll get to visit a lot of
peopleand go to a lot of places

SPANGLER
Yeah How did you sleep last
night

HOMER
Fine

SPANGLER

Did you sleep a little at
school today

HOMER
A little
SPANGLER
What subject

HOMER
Ancient history

SPANGLER
What about sports What about not
being able to take part in them
on account of having this job

HOMER
We have a physical education
period every day

SPANGLER

Is that so I used to run the 220
low hurdles when I went to Ithaca
High Valley Champion You really
want this job

HOMER
I’m going to be the best
messenger this office ever had
It is a simple statement of fact and Spangler can’t
help but smile

SPANGLER

Okay Just don’t kill yourself
Get there swiftly but don’t go
too fast Be polite to everybody
take your hat off in elevators
and - above all things - don’t
lose a telegram

HOMER
Yes Sir

SPANGLER
How old are you

HOMER
Sixteen

SPANGLER

Yeah You said that yesterday
We’re not supposed to hire a boy
unless he’s sixteen How old are
you

HOMER
Fourteen
SPANGLER
Wellsoyou’ll be sixteen in
two years What are you going to do
with the fifteen dollars a week

HOMER
Give it to my mother

SPANGLER
All right From now on you’re part
of this outfit Watch things
Listen carefully Keep your eyes
and ears open You know where
Chatterton’s Bakery is Here’s a
quarter Go get me two day-old
pies - apple and cocoanut cream

HOMER
Yes sir

And Homer catches the quarter that Spangler tosses to him

and dashes out of the office Spangler looks to Grogan

SPANGLER
What do you think of him

GROGAN
He’s a good boy

SPANGLER
I think he is Poor family No
father Brother in the Army
Mother works in the packing-house
in the summer Sister goes to Sate
College He’s a coupla years
under-age that’s all -

GROGAN
I’m a couple over-age We’1ll get
along

Spangler nods and heads for the door

SPANGLER
If you want me I’1l1 be at
Corbett’s Share the pies between
you -
but stops cold as Homer reenters breathlessly
bearing two wrapped-up PIES Spangler is stunned
SPANGLER (CONT’D)
What’s your name again
HOMER
Homer Macauley

SPANGLER
Homer Macauley you’re just the
boy this office needs You’re

probably the fastest-moving thing
in the San Joaquin Valley

Spangler claps Homer on the shoulder then exits

GROGAN
All right boy The pies

Homer places the pies on Grogan’s desktop

GROGAN (CONT’D)
Homer Macauley my name is William
Grogan I am sixty-seven years
old an old-time telegrapher - one
of the last - I am hungryand

Grogan breaks the cocoanut cream into four pieces

GROGAN (CONT’D)
from now on you and I
are friends

Grogan offers Homer a chunk of pie and bites into
own He speaks around the food

GROGAN (CONT’D)
I shall on occasion ask you to
run an errand for me In the event
of drunkenness I shall expect from
you a depth of understanding one
may not expect from men past the
age of twelve How old are you

HOMER

Fourteen But I’ve got a pretty
good understanding

GROGAN
I’1ll take your word for it Every
night I shall count on you to see
that I shall be able to perform
my duties
(Pause)

A splash of cold water in the face
if I do not respond when shaken
This is to be followed by a cup of
hot black coffee from Corbett’s

his

HOMER
Yes Sir Cold water and coffee

GROGAN

Do you think this world is going to
be a better place after the war

Homer thinks for a moment then his answer is almost
obliterated by the sudden RATTLING of the TELEGRAPH BOX
HOMER
Yes Sir
Grogan licks his finger and selects a blank POSTAL
TELEGRAPH FORM from aée pile inserts it into his
typewriter and begins to type the incoming message
GROGAN
Do you like cocoanut cream
HOMER
Yes Sir
And as Grogan types he looks at Homer - considers him

for a moment as though to size him up or to take a
mental snapshot of his youth and innocence

Then Grogan removes the telegram from the typewriter
separates the original from its carbon copy files the
carbon copyand hands the original to Homer

And while Homer dutifully folds the telegram puts it in
an envelope seals the envelope tucks it into his
capand exits

Grogan opens a desk drawer and removes a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY
and takes a long drink

WIPE TO

HOMER’ S FACE

- his eyes searching for something - as a POOR RESIDENTIAL
NEIGHBORHOOD glides by in the BACKGROUND We are

EXT G STREET - NIGHT

and Homer is coasting down the night-lit street and
checking for the right address - No 1129 He finds it He
swings his leg over the back of his bike and brakes to a
stop and leans his machine against a picket fence

EXT SANDOVAL HOUSE - SAME

On the porch Homer squares his shoulders grins to himself
and knocks on the door He waits Clears his throat

In the distance the SOUND of a TRAIN WHISTLE seems only
to make the relative silence of G Street more complete

And the door opens smoothly on its hinges to reveal
MRS SANDOVAL - a large beautiful Mexican woman standing in the
warm backlight of her home

Homer touches the brim of his cap and is about to speak -

MRS SANDOVAL
Youhave a telegram
HOMER
Yes ma’am
MRS SANDOVAL (CONT’D)
For who is it
HOMER

Mrs Rosa Sandoval 1129 G Street
He extends the telegram toward the woman but she
declines his offer
HOMER (CONT’D)
Are you Mrs Sandoval
MRS SANDOVAL

Please Come in I cannot read
English

And Homer steps just inside the door

MRS SANDOVAL

(CONT’D) Pleasehow does the
telegram read
HOMER
Ma’ am
MRS SANDOVAL

Please Open the telegram Read
to me the telegram

HOMER
Yes ma’am

And Homer opens the envelopeand we see it in stark
black and white The CAMERA SILENTLY READS

MRS ROSA SANDOVAL
1129 G STREET
ITHACA CALIFORNIA

THE SECRETARY OF WAR DESIRES ME TO EXPRESS HIS DEEP
REGRET THAT YOUR SON PVT JUAN DOMINGO SANDOVAL WAS
KILLED IN ACTION IN THE PHILIPPINES 19 MAR 42
CONFIRMING LETTER FOLLOWS

J A ULIO THE ADJUTANT GENERAL

MRS SANDOVAL
Who sends the telegram My son
Juan Domingo
Homer looks up at Mrs Sandoval Now what the hell is
he supposed to do

HOMER
No ma’am It’sfrom the
Secretary of War

MRS SANDOVAL
The Secretary of -

The word remains unsaid She studies Homer’s eyes And
Homer does the best he can

HOMER
Maybe it’s a mistake Everybody
makes a mistake Mrs Sandoval
Maybe it wasn’t your son Maybe it
was somebody else The telegram
says it was Juan Domingo but
maybe the telegram is wrong

Suddenly it is as though she cannot hear him

MRS SANDOVAL

Oh do not have fear Come
Inside Come inside I will bring
you candy

And Mrs Sandoval takes Homer by the arm and leads him

INT SANDOVAL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
to a table in the center of this small room

MRS SANDOVAL

Sit Please All boys like candy
very much I will bring you candy

And she disappears into another room and Homer scarcely
has time to register his confusion and discomfort before
she is back bearing a CANDY BOX

MRS SANDOVAL (CONT’D)
You would not bring me a bad
telegram You are a good boy -
like my Juanito when he was
little Eat this candy It is
cactus I make it for my Juanito
when he come home But you eat
Youare my boytoo

And her SOB is so sudden so profound that Homer
startles And Mrs Sandoval hugs herself - as though to
hold herself in - as though weeping were a disgrace

And Homer is off the chair and standing awkwardly - not
knowing whether to stay or go - when Mrs Sandoval grabs him
envelopes him in her arms and pulls him to her breast
inadvertently knocking Homer’s too-small hat to the floor
MRS SANDOVAL (CONT’D)
My little boy My little boy
Homer toughs it out until she releases him and

MRS SANDOVAL (CONT’D)
Comesit down Please
Herelet me look at you

Suddenly Homer feels sick to his stomach and we

CUT TO

EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

as Homer struggles to untangle the handlebars of his bike
from the picket fenceand pauses to retch his guts out
in the weeds He pulls a kerchief from his back pocket
and wipes his lips and we

CUT TO

EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Homer pedals his bike as fast as he can - so fast that
his tears streak down his cheeks at an angle

EXT POSTAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Homer brakes As he dismounts - throws his leg over the
back of his bike - he murmurs a fragment of a thought
HOMER

(A murmur)
otherwise I’m as good as
dead myself

The light of a STREET LAMP illuminates his face and he
catches his own REFLECTION in the front window of the
office He stares at himself for a moment He has stopped
crying He wipes the tears from his cheeks and enters

INT POSTAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Grogan is slumped forward - the side of his face resting
on his desk

And the telegraph box is RATTLING

Homer rushes to the old man’s sidethen gently shakes
him by the shoulders
HOMER
Mr Grogan They’re calling you
Wake up Wake up

Nothing Homer races to the ceramic WATER JAR and fills a
paper cup from its spigot and balances it back to the desk
but hesitates to follow his instructions He sets
the cup down and shakes Grogan again
HOMER (CONT’D)
MR GROGAN THERE’S A TELEGRAM
THEY’RE CALLING YOU

Nothing So Homer douses the old man right in the kisser
- empties the cup of water into Grogan’s face

And Grogan blinkssits up with a startlooks at Homer

then at the telegraph boxand click-clicks the bug
to answer the call as

GROGAN
That’s right Now quick Black
coffee Hurry
And Homer dashes out of the office and we follow him - IN
A SINGLE TAKE across

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

- where he dodges a couple of late-night automobiles -
and pushes his way into

INT CORBETT’S BAR - CONTINUOUS

- where a couple of REGULARS a few odd LOCALS and a cadre
of SOLDIERS are drinking underneath framed BOXING PHOTOS and
POSTERS advertising “YOUNG CORBETT III” and where

CORBETT (AGE 36)

AKA Raffaele “Ralph” Giordano - the former welterweight
boxing champion of the world - is the proprietor
HOMER

MR CORBETT I NEED A CUP OF
COFFEE RIGHT Now

For an instant the patrons freeze at the sight of the
14-year-old in the ill-fitting messenger uniform
demanding a cup of jothen they burst out LAUGHING
VARIOUS
Haw haw Y’hear that Get a load
o’ that The Macauley boy Didya
ever Hey Homer
But Homer stands his ground and stares intently
into Corbett’s broken-nosed face
HOMER
It’s for Mr Grogan
And Corbett grabs a cup and fills it from a pot behind the
bar while the patrons watch and Homer digs into his pocket
but Corbett waves him away as he sets the coffee on the bar
CORBETT (CONT’D)
‘ats okay No charge boy
HOMER
Thanks

Homer grips the cup with both hands and heads for the -

CORBETT
Hey Somebody get the door

And TWO PATRONS almost collide trying to get to it first

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

Homer balances the steaming cup of brew all the way into

INT POSTAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

where Grogan is click-clicking the “bug” but struggling to
stay awake He brightens as his bleary eyes focus on
Homer standing in front of him with a cup of coffee

GROGAN
That’s right boy Don’t worry

Grogan takes the cup and moves it to his lips and slurps
at the steaming hot java

GROGAN (CONT’D)
Don’t be afraid That’s exactly
right

HOMER
Is itan important telegram

GROGAN

No It is most unimportant
Business The accumulating of
money It’s a night letter You
won’t have to deliver it
tonight Most unimportant

(Pause)
But very important for me
to receive it

He takes another pull at the coffee and Homer is
amazed that anyone could drink anything so hot

And Grogan is suddenly fully awake - almost
miraculously his old self again as he proclaims

GROGAN (CONT’D)
They’ve been wanting to retire me
for years Wanting to put in
machines MultiplexesTeletypes
Machines instead of human beings

Grogan looks at Homer for an moment and confides

GROGAN (CONT’D)
I wouldn’t know what to do with
myself if I didn’t have this
job I’ve worked all my life
HOMER
Yes Sir

GROGAN
I know I can count on you to
help me Homer
Grogan licks his finger and selects a blank postal
telegraph form and slips it into the typewriter
GROGAN (CONT’D)
Youve already helped me You’ve
come to workjust in time
Grogan signals for the telegrapher at the other end to
continue and as the telegraph box commences to RATTLE and
Grogan proceeds to type the incoming message he declares
GROGAN (CONT’D)
Trying to put me out of a job I
was the fastest telegrapher in
the world Faster than Wolinsky
sending and receiving both - and
no mistakes Willie Grogan

Telegraph operators all over the
world know that name And I

Grogan pauses and smiles at Homer and corrects himself
GROGAN (CONT’D)
you and Iare still alive

The SOUND of A CLOCK CHIMING MIDNIGHT PRE-LAPS our

CUT TO

INT MACAULEY HOME - PARLOR - NIGHT

as Homer opens the front door and closes it soundlessly and
enters the parlorand is surprised to see Mrs Macauley
sitting in her rocking chair under the light of a single
lamp and knitting from a RED CROSS KNITTING BASKET

Homer just stands there for a momentwhile the
CLOCK CHIMESthen
And Homer collapses into an old overstuffed chair He

HOMER
Everything’s all right Ma I
don’t want you to sit up this
way every night Everything’s
all right

MRS MACAULEY
I know

waits a moment then

HOMER

I had to deliver a telegram to a
lady over on G Street The
telegram was from the Secretary
of War Her son is dead But she
wouldn’t believe it She made me
eat candy - made out of cactus
She hugged me and said I was her
boy And it made me feel sick
(Pause)
I never saw anybody hurt that
way before
(Pause)
When I got back to the office the
old telegraph operator was drunk

Homer looks for a reaction but Mrs Macauley is

simply listening Carefully

HOMER (CONT’D)
If he doesn’t do his work
they’11 put him on a pension I
got him sober all rightand
everything was okay
Buteverythinghas changed

And Homer Macauley is momentarily rendered helpless in

his confusion

She waits

MRS MACAULEY
Ifif it makes you feel lonely
Homer

Homer nods Yeah Lonely

MRS MACAULEY (CONT’D)
it is because nothing has
changed It is only that you are
becoming aware of the world in
which youhave been a child

And Mrs Macauley’s smile makes her candor - her unvarnished
honestysomehowbearable And Homer asserts simply

HOMER

I don’t know what’s happening - or
whybutno matter what don’t
let anything hurt you that way

Mrs Macauley smilesthen

MRS MACAULEY
What did you have for supper

HOMER

Pie Apple and cocoanut cream The
manager of the office paid for

them He’s the greatest guy I ever
met

MRS MACAULEY
I’1l1 send Bess with a supper
for you tomorrow night
HOMER
You don’t have to go to
the trouble

Homer rises He takes a deep breath and lets it go

HOMER (CONT’D)

This jobis the best thing that
ever happened to me Ma But it
sure makes school seemsilly
MRS MACAULEY

I will be here waiting for

you every night -
HOMER
No Ma -

MRS MACAULEY

- but you do not need to come in
and talk to me unless you wish to

And Homer looks down at his mother and knows that no matter
how much things have changed arguing with her is pointless
MARCUS (VO)

Dear Homer You are now the man of
the Macauley family of Ithaca

So Homer leans over and kisses her on the cheek

MARCUS (VO CONT’D)

-SO everything of mine at home
is yours - to give to Ulysses when
you no longer want them

before it starts to ring

We are

INT MACAULEY HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING

And Homer reaches under his bed and pulls out a mail-
order copy of

THE CHARLES ATLAS BODYBUILDING COURSE

and an ELASTIC STRETCHER He turns to LESSON 7
and commences with a deep breathing exercise
ULYSSES (0C)
What’s that

Sure enough Ulysses is awake wearing his nightshirt
kneeling on the edge of his bed and watching Homer’s every

move And Homer does his best to answer questions while
breathing deeplylifting his legs straight up from the
bedstretching the elastic across his chest
HOMER
Exercises
ULYSSES

ULYSSES

Ulysses dutifully get back under his covers

ULYSSES
Gonna go to school

HOMER
Yup

ULYSSES

HOMER

ULYSSES

HOMER

low hurdles when he went to Ithaca
High He was Valley Champion

ULYSSES
What’s Valley Champion
HOMER
That’s the best
ULYSSES

Ulysses hunkers down under his blanket

And Homer feeling slightly guilty for his growing
impatience with his little brother starts to get dressed
ULYSSES

Homer grins

HOMER

ULYSSES

HOMER

Once again Homer’s annoyance at Ulysses’s incessant

questions melts away

and he reassures his little brother

INT MACAULEY HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Homer enters and sits down at the BREAKFAST TABLE where

Mrs Macauley and

BESS - Homer’s older sister - are waiting for him

HOMER
Sorry I’m running late
And the three Macauleys lace their fingers together and bow
their heads for a momentthen lift them and begin to eat
- OATMEAL TOAST and fresh squeezed ORANGE JUICE
BESS
What prayer did you say
HOMER
The same one we always say
BESS
(Teasing)
I’1l bet you don’t even know
what you’re saying

Is everyone out to exasperate Homer today

But rather than rise to his sister’s bait Homer decides
to end it before it even gets started

HOMER
I do too And you know as well as
I do what it means You’re just
trying to mix me up Well don’t
worry You can I guess anybody
can mix me up right now but it
doesn’t make any difference
because I believe in what I’m
praying for Everybody does don’t
they Ma

MRS MACAULEY

Of course they do

HOMER
(To Bess)
You see Are you satisfied

And the BACK SCREEN DOOR opens and
MARY ARENA - the beautiful girl next-door - enters with a bowl
of something

Homer gets up and offers his chair
MARY

Oh no Homer Sit down You go
ahead I just had breakfast with
my father but thanks I brought
some stewed dried peaches Mrs

Macauley

MRS MACAULEY
Thank you Mary How is your
father

MARY

Fine He just won’t stop First
thing this morning - “Any letters
Any letters from Marcus yet”

BESS
We’1ll get another one soon
Bess gets up and takes her bowl to the sink

BESS (CONT’D)

Now come on Mary or we’1ll
be late to class

MARY
Ohall right

Mrs Macauley looks a question to Marcus’s sweetheart

MARY (CONT’D)

I’m getting sick and tired of
college Mrs Macauley It’s just
like high school I’d rather
justfind myself a job somewhere
MARY
So would I
MRS MACAULEY
Nonsense You’re children Your
father has a good job Mary
HOMER
And so do I -

MARY

I know But it just doesn’t seem
right to be going to school when
Marcus is in the Army and the whole
world is gouging each other’s eyes
out I wish I was man - so I could
be in the Army with Marcus

Dumbfounded by Mary’s statement Homer looks at
his motherat Maryand back again

And then Bess breaks the awkward SILENCE by taking Mary’s
arm and pulling her along toward the back screen door
BESS
C’mon Mary

»and out

The screen door SLAMS and bounces open and settles
A moment passes then

HOMER
What about that Ma

MRS MACAULEY
Its perfectly naturalfor a
couple of girlsto want to
get out and flap their wings
HOMER
No I don’t mean that I mean
Mary She -
MRS MACAULEY
Mary is a sweet unaffected
childlike girl The most childlike
girl I’ve ever known and I’m glad
Marcus is in love with her
HOMER
No It’sshe doesn’t understand
what this war

But he can’t finish his thought
He looks at his mother His mother holds his gaze and

they share an unspoken moment of candid dread for the
unspoken possibility that Marcus

HOMER (CONT’D)
I’ve got to go

And Homer gets up kisses his mother on the forehead and is
out the door And

ULYSSES

is standing behind in Homer’s empty chair - standing there
very small in his nightshirt When did he toddle in

He looks up at his mother as a small animal looks up at
a creature of its own kind which is its greatest delight
and comfort And we

as Homer - dressed for and heading for school - brakes
his bike to a sudden skidding stop lays it on its side
and runs to

A PICKET FENCE

The fence is old and rotten with no evident purpose
other than to ornament a VACANT LOT full of weeds
Starting at the base and moving up Homer measures its
height by “walking” his hand up a picket - counting the
number of tip-of-thumb to tip-of-little finger spans - and
when he stops there is still a good twelve inches left

The fence is considerably above his waist
Hmmm

He looks beyond the fence - at the weed-infested
lotthen walks ten paces away from the fence to stand
almost across the street

He takes a deep breaththen runs toward the fence as fast
as he canexecutes a picture-perfect hurdlebut catches
the top of the picket with his foot - knocking over the
rotted fence and falling face-first into the weeds and we

I don’t know how you’re going to be
able to keep our family together and
go to high school at the same time

The MORNING SUN is streaming through the windows and causing
a virtual HALO of light to form around the golden-haired

- the unspeakably beautiful yet snobbish object of
Homer’s affections - now rising up from her front-row

from their Ancient History textbook (MOS)
MARCUS (VO CONT’D)

I miss you of course and think

about you all the time I am happy

and even though I have never believed

in wars I am proud to be serving my

country which to me is Ithaca
Helen Eliot looks up and smilesat someone over
Homer’s shoulder

And Homer turns to see

HUBERT ACKLEY III

- an impossibly perfect and well-groomed boy sitting
behind Homer - who smiles back at Helen
MARCUS (VO CONT’D)

I do not recognize any enemy which

is human for no human being can

be my enemy
Homer scowls at Hubertand Hubert scowls right back
at Homer

at Homer

Hubert is decked out in his track clothes and - along
with THREE OTHER BOYS - is taking his place in the lanes
for the 220 low hurdles while Homer wearing his school
clothes watches grimly from the bleachers

MARCUS (VO CONT’D)

-he is my friend not my enemy
for he is no different from myself

And then Hubert throws a smile at Helen Eliot and it’s
more than Homer can bear

MARCUS (VO CONT’D)
I do not feel like a hero

Homer jumps to his feet and runs to the empty FIFTH LANE

MARCUS (VO CONT’D)
I do not feel patriotic either for
I have always loved my country

and assumes the starting position just as

- an overweight former athlete - lifts his PISTOL in

MARCUS (VO CONT’D)

I would rather I were not in the

Army I would rather there were no

And although Homer is wearing the wrong kind of shoes the
wrong kind of clothes has barely practiced and simply
isn’t supposed to be there
He takes the first hurdle slightly ahead of Hubert Ackley

MARCUS (VO CONT’D)
but as I am in the Army and
there is a War I have long

shakes his headand starts to run on a course that will

While Grogan busies himself filing sent telegrams Ulysses
- sitting in a chair across the desk from Spangler -
watches fascinated as the manager of the telegraph office
negotiates with someone on the telephone
SPANGLER
I promised When did I promise to
go out to dinner with your
parents Uh huhmm hmm
Spangler rolls his eyes and looks to Ulysses as though
to say “Can you believe this”
SPANGLER (CONT’D)
Okay take it easy Every time you
call me “darling” I want to - uh
huhseven o’clock sharp What do
you mean - “sharp”
And Spangler lifts a framed PHOTOGRAPH from his desktop
and turns it around so that Ulysses can see

A PHOTOGRAPH OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (30S)
Ulysses stares at the photo as

SPANGLER (CONT’D)
I see What do you mean “evening

clothes I wear day and evening both

And Spangler hangs up the receiver He looks to Grogan who
only shakes his head and turns awayand to Ulysses

(Affecting a woman’s falsetto)

“You do love me don’t you You

know you do”
But Ulysses’s expression of innocent curiosity has
not changed Spangler checks his watch as

enters limping

And Ulysses’s face splits into a silly grin

Hi Homer

HOMER
Mr Spangler I’m sorry I’m late -
Ulysses what are you doing here

SPANGLER

It’s all right Homer So
Ulysses eh That explains it
Your bother Ulysses The little
fellow just wandered in and took
a seat while I was on the phone
Fearless is what he is Anda
very good listener

Spangler watches Homer limp over to the delivery desk

SPANGLER (CONT’D)
Is everything all right
HOMER
Yes Sir

SPANGLER

Okay then A few telegrams have
piled up and a few calls Take
the calls first then deliver
the telegrams

HOMER
Yes Sir Right away I’m awfully

And the CALL BOX RINGS and starts printing out its
message on ticker tape

Spangler reads the tape

ear toward the pattern of DITS and DASHES
GROGAN
That’s Sunripe Raisin now

And Spangler jerks open the door and

a wide receiver

He’s in the middle of the SECOND BLOCK when he sees
A GIRL - a shy lonely-looking girl - tired sweet hushed
and wonderful - standing on the corner - at the

And without clowning and with no premeditation Spangler
pauses in his mad dash

And kisses her on the cheek

on his bicycle and heading for their common goal

Spangler and the Western Union Messenger lock eyesand
Spangler pours it on as the Messenger stand-up-pedals

The race is onand Spangler narrowly misses being
creamed by a car as he dashes across the street

It’s going to be close

And just as the Messenger pushes himself toward the front
of the building Spangler grabs a LIGHT POLE with one hand
and slingshots himself around and through the front door

LONG LOVE

INT KINEMA THEATER - LATER

Texas is sitting beside Mary their faces flickering in
the light reflected from the MOVIE SCREEN as the corny
hyper-dramatic NEWSREEL NARRATION fills the theater

NEWSREEL (0C)

Unprecedented in the annals of the
United States was the inauguration
of Mr Roosevelt to his third
term He took office to face the
most critical period of our
nations history

Andon Mary’s other sideHorse is debating whether or
not to put his arm around Bess

ROOSEVELT (0C)

To us there has come a time in the
midst of swift happenings to pause
for a moment and take stock — to
recall what our place in history
has been and to rediscover what we
are and what we may be

HORSE’ S TELEGRAM

HELLO MA JUST WANT TO SAY HELLO FROM ITHACA IN SUNNY
CALIFORNIA ONLY ITS RAINING HA HA GIVE MY REGARDS
TO EVERYBODY TELL JOE HE CAN HAVE MY GUN AND SHELLS

DONT FORGET TO WRITE LOVE
QUENTIN

And Bess is staring intently at the screen as

ROOSEVELT (0C)
A nation like a person has
something deeper something more
permanent something larger than
the sum of all its parts

And Fat is happily devouring a bag of POPCORN

FAT’S TELEGRAM

MY DARLING I LOVE YOU I MISS YOU I THINK OF YOU
ALWAYS KEEP WRITING KEEP STUDYING KEEP WAITING
KEEP BELIEVING DONT FORGET ME DONT EVER FORGET ME
BECAUSE I AM THE ONE WHO WILL NEVER FORGET YOU

NORMAN

And Fat looks at Bess and smiles gratefully and offers
his popcorn

But Bess is transfixed by the image on the screen
FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT

captured by the NEWSREEL FOOTAGE of his 3rd
INAUGURAL ADDRESS
ROOSEVELT
It is the spirit — the faith — of
America It is the product of
centuries It was born in the
multitudes of those who came from
many lands — some of high degree
but mostly plain people who
sought here early and late to
find freedom more freely

And we are ON BESS’S FACE as

MARCUS (VO)
It’s yours

BACK TO

INT “THE DIVE BOMBER” BAR - NORTH CAROLINA - NIGHT
Tobey is looks from the SNAPSHOT OF BESS to Marcus

MARCUS
Take it Keep it Stick it in our
helmet liner
And Marcus folds up his as-yet-unfinished letter to
Homer and without looking at his friend says simply

MARCUS (CONT’D)
But whatever you do make sure
that every breath you take from
now onwill be to keep you alive
until you get to Ithaca and meet
her In person

Marcus drains his beer and gets up He slaps a couple of
coins on the bar and leaves - leaves Tobey sitting at
the bar and staring at the snapshot

EXT “THE DIVE BOMBER” BAR - MOMENTS LATER

It is raining as Marcus steps outside

He puts on his garrison cap folds up the collar of
his olive drab jacket and walks OUT OF FRAME And we

CUT TO

INT POSTAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE - NIGHT

as Homer - soaking wet and limping - enters and checks
the delivery desk as Grogan finishes typing an incoming
telegram
GROGAN
Your sister Bess brought
your supper
HOMER
She did
Grogan nods to the BOX on his desk tucks the typed
telegram into an envelope then pulls his bottle of
whiskey from a drawer
HOMER (CONT’D)
I was going to get us two pies

Homer opens the box and looks at the contents
HOMER (CONT’D)

There’s plenty here Will you
share it with me

GROGAN
I’m not hungry

And Grogan takes a long swig

HOMER
Maybeif you start to eat a
little your appetite will improve
GROGAN
No Thanks very much You know
we’ve got raincoats
HOMER
I know But I got caught in the
rain I’ll justtake a bite of
this sandwichthen T’il
deliver the telegram
He takes a bite of his sandwich He chews for a

moment then

HOMER (CONT’D)
Whatkind of a telegram is it

Grogan just looks at him
So it’s going to be another one of those
Homer swallows then

GROGAN
Your sister was with another girl
- a very pretty girl
HOMER
That’s Mary Our neighbor She’s
Marcus’s girl My brother - in the
Army They’re going to be married
after the War
GROGAN
They were with three soldiers
who sent telegrams
Grogan registers Homer’s surprise and nods toward the
HOOK on which DISPATCHED TELEGRAMS are hung

And Homer pulls them off the hook and reads them
Then he looks to the old man

HOMER
If these men diethey don’t
just die for nothingdo they
Grogan considers the sodden young messenger and takes
a good long pull from his bottle

GROGAN
I dont know the answer to that
question my boy Im not even
sure there is an answer
(Pause)
Its a young question and Im
an old man

But Homer isn’t prepared to take “No” for an answer So
he just nods holds Grogan’s gazeand waits Finally

GROGAN (CONT’D)
Nothingis for nothing - least
of all dying I thinkjust as a
man’s conscience struggles with
the opposites in his own nature
mischief and good struggle in the
whole body of the living - in the
whole world And that’s when we
have a war But the goodendures
forever And the evil is driven
away every time

Grogan sighsand frowns He pulls a slip of PAPER
from his vest pocket

GROGAN (CONT’D)
Nobody dies for nothing They die

seeking gracewill yourun an

errand for me To the drug store
HOMER

Yes Sir

And Homer takes the slip of paper reads it nods at
Grogan and rushes - limping - out of the office

And Grogan sits alone in the telegraph office

He looks around with a strange affection for
everything mixed with a kind of loving fury

Slowly he clutches his cheststiffensand
waitsfor the attack to pass

He waits
And waits
Until Homer bursts though the door

The young man hands Grogan a SMALL BOX

GROGAN
Water

And Grogan shakes THREE PILLS out of the box and into
his hand while Homer fills a paper cup with water from
the ceramic water jar
Grogan tosses the pills into his mouth takes the cup
and drinks them down
GROGAN (CONT’D)
Thank you Thank you my boy
HOMER
Yes Sir

Homer stares at the old man for a moment then lifts the
telegram envelope from Grogan’s deskopens itwithdraws
the telegramreads itthen takes up a fresh envelope
tucks the telegram insideseals itand limps out

After a moment Grogan lifts himself out of his chairgoes
to the dooropens it

EXT POSTAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

and watches Homer pushing away on his bicycle against
the wind and the rain

Inside the office the telegraph box begins to RATTLE
but Grogan pays it no mind

The TELEPHONE RINGSbut Grogan doesn’t turn back into
the office until it has rung seven times

And as he reenters we

CUT TO

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

It’s a large house a fine house and its windows are
ablaze with light

The rain has stopped The MOON is shining and
everything isglistening

As Homer climbs off his bicycle he can hear MUSIC
coming from inside He climbs the front-porch steps and

stands listening at the front door Inside a
phonograph is playing

TINO ROSSI’S “CHANSON POUR MA BRUNE”

Homer moves his finger toward the DOORBELLthen lets
it drop

He sits down on the front-porch steps After a long
moment he gets up and presses the doorbell

A YOUNG WOMAN opens the door

And Homer turns and runs - down the front-porch steps to
his bicycle

YOUNG WOMAN
Wait What’s the matter

And Homer stops He has a job to do He climbs the steps
and approaches the Young Woman And sees

INT HOUSE - SAME
A short HALLWAY The music is so goofily cheerful

HOMER
I’m sorry I’ve got a telegram
For Mrs Claudia Beaufrere
YOUNG WOMAN
Of course you do It’s her
birthday

She turns and call out

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
MOTHER HERE’S A TELEGRAM

MRS BEAUFRERE appears in the hallway

MRS BEAUFRERE

It’s from Alan I’m sure Come in
young man You must have a piece
of my birthday cake

HOMER
No Thank you ma’am I’ve got to
go back to -

MRS BEAUFRERE
Nonsense Not until you’ve had a
piece of cake and a glass of punch

And she takes Homer gently by he arm and tugs him into

INT HOUSE - PARLOR - CONTINUOUS
A DOZEN GUESTS

are laughing chatting eating and drinking around a table
laden with CAKE and SANDWICHES and PUNCHor dancing to
the music from the phonograph

Mrs Beaufrere hands Homer a glass of punch locks eyes
with himand smiles The telegram is still unopened in
her other hand

And Homer sets the glass of punch on the table turns
and walks back into the hallway and out the front door

MRS BEAUFRERE
Whywhat

Mrs Beaufrere follows him into the hallway
MRS BEAUFRERE (CONT’D)
Please Wait

And there is something so urgent and plaintive in the
woman’s voice that Homer stops in spite of himself

He is standing in the open doorway as he turns and
watches Mrs Beaufrere open the envelopeand read its
contents as Tino Rossi hits a sustained ridiculously
high warbling NOTE (a high B-flat)

And she looks up - into Homer’s eyes
With all his might Homer tries to hold the woman’s gaze
- to withstand the misery there as from the other room

YOUNG WOMAN (0OC)
Mother

SMASHCUT TO

EXT KINEMA THEATER - NIGHT

as the doors open and the theater empties its patrons
onto the street

Bess looks to Mary then turns to Fat
BESS
Well we need to go home now
Fat looks to Texas and Horsethen
FAT
Thank you American girls

And - easily and innocently - he kisses Bess
And then he kisses Mary
The girls look at one another - this is all right isn’t it

HORSE

What about us We’re in the Army
too

And Horse steps forward and Bess and Mary allow him to kiss
them Then Texas clears his throatand follows suit

Bess smiles at the Three Soldiersthen
BESS
Come on Mary

And Bess and Mary turn away and hurry down the street

The Three Soldiers stand there - frozen in tableau for an
instant - then Horse gives Texas a shove Texas shoves Fat

TEXAS

Woooo-eeee How you talk boy Old
Senator Fat from the University of

Chicago
HORSE

You surely got the gift Fat
FAT

Wait’1l I get to Congress
TEXAS

Yippee-aye-ay Waaa-hooo
And the Three Soldiers LAUGHING punching one another
turn and head up the street as Homer pedals past them

And we FOLLOW HOMERand

CUT TO

INT POSTAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
as Homer enters and checks the delivery desk All clear

Then Homer catches Grogan watching him And Homer knows
that Grogan knows that he has just delivered the news of
the death of Mrs Beaufrere’s son

Without saying a word Homer sits in the chair across from
Grogan and a silent moment passes between them Then
rather than addressing the issue at hand Grogan asks

GROGAN
So What’s the matter with your
leg boy

HOMER

It’s nothing I guessI twisted
a ligament or something

Homer sits in the chair across the desk from Gorgan

HOMER (CONT’D)
I was running the 220 low-hurdles
The coach - Mr Byfield - never did
like me I guess And Iwell I
decided to run at the last minute
And I was in first place when he
came out and tried to stop me I
saw him coming I guess I could’ve
stopped if I’d wanted to but I
didn’t want to So I hurdled anyway
- and we both fell down

Homer pauses and stretches his leg He looks at Grogan

HOMER (CONT’D)
The other guys stopped running on
account of the interference A guy
named Hubert Ackley the Third made
‘em stop He’s a guy I never used
to like Rich family good manners
andthe girl I like likes him
Helen Eliot But Ackley stopped the
race And after Byfield and I got
up off the ground we all started
to run again fair and square But
thenI didn’t want to beat
Ackley

Homer considers the irony for a moment then

HOMER (CONT’D)
I knew something was wrong with my
legandthe truth is the only
reason I wanted to run the race in
the first place was because Mr
Spangler ran that race when he
went to Ithaca High He was Valley
Championand Iaw it’s all
confused Everything changed out
there

Homer takes a deep breath and lets it go

HOMER (CONT’D)
I guessI’1l rub some liniment
on it tonight

The old telegraph operator considers the young messenger
then

GROGAN

You’ve changed You’ve changed
since you came to work - what
three days ago

HOMER
Yeah

Homer nods And then just because it’s Mr Grogan
Homer admits it

HOMER (CONT’D)
I guess I have changedmaybe
it was time I didn’t know
anything before I got this job I
guess I was in awell a sort of
happydaydream Everybody says
I’m the smartest guy at Ithaca
High even people who don’t like
me But I’m just as backward as
anybody in a lot of things -
important things And I don’t like
the way things are I justwant
them to be better

(Pause)
How can any man ever really get it
all straight - so that it all

comes out even and makes sense
Everything’s so sad or mixed
upand wrong And now I don’t
care if Helen Eliot doesn’t
like me I wish she did but if
she doesn’t that’s okay

Homer flexes his leg again then speaks of it as if
it weren’t his own
HOMER (CONT’D)
Yeah Something’s the matter with
it
He looks up at the clock

HOMER (CONT’D)
It’s five after twelve I guess
I’1l go home Tomorrow’s Saturday

Homer rises and looks directly at Grogan

HOMER (CONT’D)
Saturdays used to be my
best days

And Homer lifts the supper box that Bess brought then

HOMER (CONT’D)

Are you sure you wouldn’t like
a sandwich now

GROGAN

Wellcome to think of it yes I
would

Homer takes a sandwich out of the box and hands it
to Grogan
GROGAN (CONT’D)
Please thank your mother for me
HOMER
Aw it’s nothing

GROGAN
No It is something Please
Thank her

And Homer manages a smile And a nod
HOMER
Yes Sir

SPANGLER (VO PRE-

You know you do”

as Spangler fresh from dinner and Corbett’s and a little
under the influence enters the office and beams at Grogan
- who is just finishing his sandwich
GROGAN
Tom
SPANGLER
Willie what would you think of
a woman who tells you like this
“You do love me don’t you You
know you do”
GROGAN
I don’t know what I’d think

Spangler sits at his own desk and rubs his face as if to
rub away his inebriation then

SPANGLER

What do you think of the
new messenger

And Grogan looks at Spangler and tells it like it is

GROGAN
He’s the best I’ve ever seen

CUT TO

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Homer is pedalling fast down a street so dark that he
must squint to see ahead of him

A SUDDEN WIND GUST

nearly topples him And then he turns to see

A POSTAL TELEGRAPH MESSENGER

pedalling his bike furiously in the same direction but

on the opposite side of the street

The Messenger looks just like Homer

And he is pulling awaymoving faster nowand Homer
pours it on but

COACH BYFIELD

is standing in Homer’s way - standing in the middle of the

street and waving his arms - and Homer swerves to avoid
him and nearly collides with the Messenger

And the Messenger looks a him It is Homer himself but
his face is utterly passive Blank Devoid of the sheer
unfettered determination that qualifies Homer Macauley

And suddenly the Messenger slams his bike into Homer’s

Homer starts to careen off the side of the road but
manages to right himselfand to pedal - standing up in
spite of the searing pain in his leg - faster than he has
ever pedalled before

HOMER
No Wait DON’T GO THERE STAY
AWAY LEAVE THEM ALONE

CUT TO

HOMER
- eyes clamped shut his face contorted in pain - shouting

HOMER
LEAVE ITHACA ALONE

- and sobbing Crying in his sleep We are

INT MACAULEY HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

And Ulysses - wearing his nightshirt - is standing in the
MOONLIGHT standing at Homer’s bedside and staring at his
brother who is crying out and sobbing in his sleep

After a moment Ulysses turnsand walks OUT OF FRAME

CUT TO

INT MACAULEY HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING

as Mrs Macauley sets a spoon and a bowl of steaming

hot oatmeal on the kitchen table

Homer enters Mrs Macauley throws a fleeting glance in
his direction before turning away to commence squeezing
oranges for his juice

And when Homer speaks there is a depth and gravity to
his tone that we haven’t heard before

HOMER
I didn’t want to sleep this late
It’s almost nine-thirty What
happened to the alarm clock

MRS MACAULEY

You’re working hard You need
rest too -

HOMER
I’m not working so hard Besides
tomorrow’s Sunday

Homer sits laces his fingers together closes his eyes and

recites his morning prayer - to himself - and Mrs Macauley

stops squeezing the juice for a moment to regard her son

She turns toward the counter just before he opens his eyes
and lifts his spoon and pauses to study the shiny utensil

HOMER (CONT’D)
Ma
But Mrs Macauley doesn’t turn around She continues
to squeeze the juice from the oranges
MRS MACAULEY
Yes Homer

And Homer confesses unburdens himself

HOMER
I didn’t talk to you last night
when I came home from work because
I couldn’t Becausewellall
of a sudden on the way home I
started to cry

Homer looks to his mother for a response but having filled

one glass with juice she simply starts on another

HOMER (CONT’D)
You know I never cried when I was
little Even Ulysses never cries
because - well what’s the use
(Pause)
But I just couldn’t help it So
I couldn’t come straight home I
just kept riding I rode across
town - past a house where some
people had been having a birthday
party andthe house was dark
(Pause)
I took those people a
telegram Earlier

Mrs Macauley pauses But rather than turning around she

begins slicing more oranges to squeeze for their juice

HOMER (CONT’ D)

AndI just rode - all around the
streets - and I reallysaw
Ithaca last night Ma

(Pause)
I know all of the people here And
I don’t want anything to happen to
them

(Pause)
I thought a fellow would never cry
when he got to be grown upbut
that’s when you start finding
out about thingsand almost
everything a man finds out is
bador sad - why is that Ma

And Mrs Macauley turns and places a glass of fresh
orange juice beside Homer’s untasted oatmeal

MRS MACAULEY
I can’t tell you Because I don’t
know No one can tell you Each
manand each womanfinds out
in hisor herown way

It’s a painful admission for this widowed mother but she

sits across from her son and tells him her dearest truth

MRS MACAULEY (CONT’D)
But I do know this That the world
waits to be made-over every
morning by each and every human
being who inhabits it

Homer stares at his mother for a momentthen

HOMER
Why did I cry on the way home
last night

Mrs Macauley measures her words carefully

MRS MACAULEY
If a manhas not wept at the
world’s painhe is only half
a man
Homer looks down at his uneaten oatmeal And Mrs Macauley
waits until he lifts his eyes to hers
MRS MACAULEY (CONT’D)
There will always be pain in the
world Homer And a good man

will seek to take the pain out
of things

But before Homer can respond Ulysses enters the room with
LIONEL (AGE 10)
- a simple boy and Ulysses’s best friend

MRS MACAULEY
Hello Lionel

LIONEL

Mrs Macauley Ulysses and me have
already been to Mr Henderson’s
apricot tree with Auggie Enoch
Shag Nickie and Alf But the
apricots aren’t ripe

MRS MACAULEY
Of course they’re not It’s only
almost April

LIONEL

Well they’re gonna play football
now and Ulysses is too small and
Ulysses and me we’re partners and
I want to ask permission to take
Ulysses to he pubalic liberry

MRS MACAULEY

Of course Would you boys like a
drink of juice before you go

Both boys nod and Mrs Macauley hands them each a glass and
they drink thirstilyhand the glasses backand are gone
Homer has tucked in to his oatmeal by now

as the screen door SLAMS and bounces open

HOMER

Was Marcus like Ulysses when he

was little

MRS MACAULEY
How do you mean

HOMER

He looks up
and settles

Interested in everything Doesn’t
say much but always gets a kick

out of everything Likes
everybody and everybody likes
him Fearless

MRS MACAULEY
Ulysses is like his father

except

HOMER
What

MRS MACAULEY
No manis fearless

Homer considers this

He listens to the SOUNDS of the neighborhood gang
playing football in the vacant lot next doorthen

HOMER

I wishI could be like Ulysses

MRS MACAULEY

He came to me last night He woke

me up and brought me to your room

HOMER
What Why
MRS MACAULEY

Because you were crying in
your sleep last night too
HOMER
I hada bad dream

Homer gets up from the table collects his bowl and

juice glass and moves to the kitchen sink

MRS MACAULEY
Homerwhat’s the matter with
your leg

HOMER
Nothing I took a little spill

He looks out through the kitchen window where

INT MACAULEY HOME - KITCHEN - SAME
Homer looks down at the sinkthe kitchen counterthen

HOMER

You know MaI guess you’re
just about the most wonderful
person anybody could ever know

And as Mrs Macauley opens her mouth to respond to her son’s
utterly unexpected expression of love and appreciation
Homer clatters his place setting into the sink and turns on
the water and starts to wash the bowl and glass
MRS MACAULEY
Homer —-

But she is interrupted by the SOUND the football game and

HOMER
There goes Auggie Another
touchdown
Homer places his bowl on the drying rack shuts off
the water and announces
HOMER (CONT’D)
No more games for me
Indeed to Mrs Macauley Homer seemssuddenlygrown up
as he dries his hands on a dish towel and turns to her
HOMER (CONT’D)
I’m going to the telegraph

office I told them I would come
down just in case they need me

And Homer starts to go -

MRS MACAULEY
Son

HOMER

Oh Mr Grogan - he’s the night
telegraph operator - he ate one
of the sandwiches you sent
yesterday with Bess and he told
me to thank you So thanks Ma
for Mr Grogan

And Homer is out the back door and gone And Mrs Macauley
remains seated at the kitchen table for a moment Then she
rises and moves to the window in time to see

EXT MACAULEY HOME - MRS MACAULEY’S POV

Homer bounces his bike a coupla times to check the air
in the tiresthen climbs aboard and pedals away

the bitter sweetness of this event begins to register

Mrs Macauley turns to look at the chair that
Homer occupied scarcely a moment agoto see
MATTHEW MACAULEY

sitting where Homer sat and studying the same spoon
that Homer studied
After a moment the long-dead Matthew Macauley looks up
and locks eyes with his wifeand smiles - a smile which
says Yes to all things
And Mrs Macauley looks at him as though it is the most
natural thing in the world that he should be sitting there
MRS MACAULEY
Yes Matthew
MATTHEW MACAULEY
Katey

MRS MACAULEY
Yes

There is something that Matthew Macauley needs to tell his
wife but it is hard to say it out loud and he hesitates

MATTHEW MACAULEY

But Mrs Macauley shakes her head She will not hear it
MRS MACAULEY
No Please Matthewno

And she turns to empty the dishes drying in the dish-rack
and to hide the tears that are welling in her eyes and we

Slowly Marcus turns to look at Tobeyand

Marcus blinks a couple of times and focuses on Tobey

The AFTERNOON SUN is slanting through a WINDOW
illuminating DUST MOTES suspended in the motionless air of
the small open foyer of this run-down little hotel

A long narrow FLIGHT OF STAIRS offers to lead him upto
a dimly lighted landing

This place is too creepytoosad for words and Homer’s
face betrays his discomfortand something like fear

But he swallows it down takes a deep breath and looks

at the address on the telegram envelope in his hand

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Homer enters the hallway from the top of the stairs
turns and stares down a row of closed DOORS

On a small table against the wall a SIGN is propped
up behind a BELL The sign reads RING

As Homer approaches it he can make out the SOUNDS of a
PHONOGRAPHA WOMAN’S VOICE LAUGHINGA MAN’S VOICE

Suddenly a door opens and
A MAN (40s)

exits one of the rooms He holds his jacket in his hand
as he turns back and says into the room

MAN
SothanksI’1ll see ya

He nods closes the door puts on his jacket and buckles
his belt as he hurries past Homer and down the stairs

Homer presses the belland the door that the Man
just closed now opens again and

Okay In a minute

And the door closesand Homer waits
And when the door opens again
A GIRL steps out into the hallway She’s very pretty but her
makeup is smudged and there’s too much of it to begin with

HOMER

GIRL
She’s out just now Can I sign for

Yes ma’am
And the Girl looks at Homer and has an idea
GIRL

Wait just a minute will ya

Homer nods and she runs back into her room

ANOTHER MAN (30s)

has made it to the top of the stairs He and Homer
exchange a glance
Then the Girl opens her door and starts to come out
but sees the Man and stops

then walks to the

An unfamiliar pungent smell makes Homer wrinkle his nose

She hands Homer an ENVELOPE then gently lifts his chin
up with her finger and looks straight into his eyes

HOMER

DOLLY HAWTHORNE

I know all the boys Western Union

HOMER
Yes ma’am

DOLLY HAWTHORNE
Here

And she hands Homer a small stack of CALLING CARDS
HOMER
What’swhat are these for

DOLLY HAWTHORNE

You visit a lot of peopleand
go to a lot of places

Dolly tries to gauge whether or not Homer understands then

DOLLY HAWTHORNE

Just leave a card wherever you go
Wherever there are traveling people
soldierssailors With this
War going on we’ve got to make
our boys happy

And Dolly Hawthorne pinches Homer on the cheek as she
sweeps past him and up the stairs

DOLLY HAWTHORNE (CONT’D)
Because they could be alive today
and dead tomorrow

A DEAD FACE
with a blank expression and a complexion like wax

AUGGIE (OC)
Nahhe can’t be

We are

EXT OWL DRUG STORE - DUSK

And a CROWD OF IDLERS and PASSERS-BY - including Auggie
Enoch Shag Nickie and Alf - have gathered in front of
the drugstore WINDOW to stare at the new display

MR MECHANO

- a man standing motionless between to EASELS A SIGN
on one of the easels proclaims

MR MECHANO
THE MACHINE MAN - HALF MACHINE HALF HUMAN
MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE
50 IF YOU CAN MAKE HIM SMILE
500 IF YOU CAN MAKE HIM LAUGH
Suddenly he moves - like a piece of machinery - and

the Crowd GASPS
Auggie - standing right up front with his bundle
of NEWSPAPERS for sale under his arm - declares
AUGGIE
It’s a machine
ENOCH
I don’t think so Auggie

SHAG
No Auggie’s right It’s a robot
I’m tellin’ ya

NICKIE
Watch Lookit him

ALF
I don’t know

And Mr Mechano is indeed robot-like as he lifts a
CARDBOARD SIGN from a PILE on a small TABLE in front of
himand places it on the other easel

Don’t drag yourself around half dead Enjoy life
Take Dr Bradford’s Tonic and feel like a new man

And then Mr Mechano lifts a pointer from the table
and proceeds to point at each word

LIONEL
It’s a man

Lionel has squeezed to the front of the crowd and
has dragged Ulysses there by the hand

And Ulysses is entranced
AUGGIE
Aw whadda you know Lionel

And Mr Mechano removes the SIGNand selects
anotherand we

TOBEY

staring out of a PORTHOLE We are

INT TROOPSHIP - NIGHT

in a CARGO-HOLD that has been converted into a BARRACKS
of three-tiered “PIPE-BERTHS” for the SOLDIERS
Tobey turns away from the porthole and navigates his
way through the berths to find Marcus writing his
letter to Homer by the light of a FLASHLIGHT
MARCUS
You feel okay
TOBEY
Yeah I’m okay

And Tobey swings himself up into his berth

He lies there for a moment accustoming himself to the

movement of the shipthen reaches into his pocket and

withdraws the snapshot of Bess while below him

Marcus concerned about his friend is staring up at Tobey’s

bunk He puts pen to paper and picks up where he left of
MARCUS (VO)

therefore this may be my last
letter to you for some time I
hope it is not the last of all My
friend here is an orphan I think
it’s strange that of all the guys
here he should become my friend
His name is Tobey George and I
have told him all about Ithaca and
our family

EXT OWL DRUG STORE - NIGHT

MARCUS (VO)
Some day I will bring him to
Ithaca

Mr Mechano lifts the sign we first saw and places it on
the easel

And Lionel has seen enough

LIONEL

Come on Ulysses Let’s go We’ve
seen him go through all the cards
three times Let’s go home It’s
dark

Lionel takes Ulysses hand but Ulysses pulls it back
so mesmerized is he by the wonder of Mr Mechano

LIONEL (CONT’D)
I’m going Ulysses
And Lionel walks away
And we PULL BACK to REVEAL that Ulysses is all alone -
the last one left

And Mr Mechano stops moving

And the STREET LIGHTS of Ithaca flicker on

And Ulysses turns to look at them And when he turns
back

Mr Mechano is looking right a him

And a swift and fierce terror seizes Ulysses and he
starts to run

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Ulysses runs He has no idea where he is or where he
is going and when he stops for a moment breathing
hard and almost cryinghe pants

ULYSSES

Homer

He looks aroundand his sense of his world is scattered by
the fear of the horror that might be catching up to him

And he starts to run again Then stops when he hears

JAPANESE ISLANDS POINT WAY FOR

And he runs around a corner to see

AUGGIE

standing on another corner a block away hawking his
papers to PASSERSBY

AUGGIE
AMERICANS STRIKE HARD IN MINDANAO
And Ulysses runs with all his might to the newsboy and
hugs him so forcefully that it almost knocks Auggie down

AUGGIE

Ulysses What’s the matter What
are you crying about

But Ulysses is incapable of speech

AUGGIE (CONT’D)

Are you scared There’s nothing to
be scared of

And Ulysses starts to hiccup through his sobs

AUGGIE (CONT’D)
C’mon We’ll go to Homer

Mrs Macauley is in the backyard by the chicken coop and
the walnut tree

She is pulling CLOTHES off the CLOTHESLINE as Homer
with Ulysses riding on the handlebars pedals across the

vacant lot lifts Ulysses to the ground and the two boys
squeeze through the gap in the fence

Ulysses runs to the chicken coop

HOMER

He got lost Ma Auggie found him
and brought him to the telegraph
office He shouldn’t have been out
so late I thinkI think
somethingscared him

Mrs Macauley sets aside the laundry and kneels down
beside her little boy
MRS MACAULEY
Ulysses

And Ulysses turns his tear-stained face to herand smiles

HOMER

Careful There’suhthere’s a
busted egg in his pocket

And Mrs Macauley wraps her arms around Ulysses and hugs
him tight

I don’t know why it has taken me so
long to write this letter Homer

On the STAGE a horse-faced dried out old battle-ax of a
WOMAN with pince-nez is addressing a roomful of wonderful
plump vague MIDDLE-AGED LADIESas Homer comes running up
the center aisle to deliver a telegram to her

MARCUS (VO CONT’D)
But I know that when the time
comes I will do what is expected
of me and maybe even more than is
expected of me
The old hag is obviously thrilled by such a dramatic
while Homer looks uncomfortably at the
audience of Middle-Aged Ladies - all smiling at him -

delivery and

she digs A QUARTER from her purse and hands it to him

MARCUS (VO CONT’D)
But I want you to know I will be
obeying no command other than the
command of my own heart

EXT OWL DRUG STORE - DUSK

Homer drops the quarter into the cup of A LEGLESS MAN

selling pencils on the sidewalk beneath the window where
Mr Mechano once scared Ulysses

Now the window is filled with SUMMERTIME DECORATIONS

MARCUS (VO CONT’ D)
I am glad that I am the Macauley

INT CLASSROOM - ITHACA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Homer is sitting with his elbow on his desk and his

chin resting on his hand as

THE SCHOOL BELL RINGS (MOS)

(We see the clapper vibrating furiously against the

metal bell)

And the CLASS rises up all of a sudden

CHEER and race out of the room

The Students

And Homer watches Hubert Ackley III walk out with Helen

Eliot

Homer rises from behind his desk

MARCUS (VO CONT’D)
You must go on being the best You
must live in the years of your
life forever You are what we are
fighting the War for Yes you My

and smiles at Miss Hicks

And the ancient teacher of Ancient History smiles
somewhat sadly back at Homer lifts an eraser and erases
from the BLACKBOARD the words

HAVE A HAPPY SUMMER

EXT MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Homer pedals down the street toward the Postal
Telegraph Office
MARCUS (VO CONT’ D)
How could I ever tell you such
things if we were together

And now it is Homer who is reading the letter

HOMER (VO)
You would jump me and wrestle with
me and call me a fool but even so
everything I have said is true

END MONTAGE

We are

INT POSTAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE - NIGHT

and Homer is sitting across the desk from Mr Grogan
and reading directly from Marcus’s letter

HOMER

“Now I will write your name
here to remind you Homer
Macauley That’s who you are”

Homer looks up at Mr Grogan And the old man takes a long
pull from his bottle of whiskey Then Homer continues

HOMER (CONT’D)
“T miss you very much I can’t
wait until I see you again When
that happens I will let you
wrestle me to the floor in the
parlor in front of Ma and Bess and
Ulysses and maybe Mary even - I’11l
let you do that because I will be
so glad to see you again God
bless you So long Your brother
Marcus”

And Homer’s hands are trembling as he fits the letter back
into its envelope He bites his lip to hold back his
tears then looks to Mr Grogan

HOMER (CONT’D)
If my brother is killed in this
stupid warI’1l spit at the
world I’ll hate it forever I
won’t be good I’1l be the worst
of them all The worst that ever
lived

And then the tears come He sniffs Once Wipes his eyes
with the back of his hand

GROGAN
No You be grateful for yourself
Homer You be thankful That’s
what your brother’s trying to
tell you boy

There is an edge to Mr Grogan’s voice that Homer
hasn’t heard before

HOMER
Mr Groganare you drunk

GROGAN

Yes I am I feel a lot better
when I’m drunk I’m telling you
something that I might not tell
you unless I were drunk

And Grogan zeros-in on Homer with alcohol-fueled
intensity and a good deal of genuine love

GROGAN (CONT’D)
Your goodnessis yours to protect
and to spread around - for meand
for everybody else in the world
Be thankful that you’re a man who
will be trusted by total strangers
They’11 know that you won’t betray
them or hurt them - that you’ll see
something in them that everyone
else has failed to see You are a
man Homer fourteen years old Who
made you such a man I don’t know
But it’s true Know that it’s
trueand be grateful for
yourself Do you understand

And Homer just looks at his old friendand slowly nods

it’s half-past midnight

across the street at

Wait here a minute will ya I’1l

Homer shakes him but there is no response

EXT MAIN STREET - DUSK

Homer runs toward Bess Mary Ulysses and Lionel

HOMER

Mr Grogan’s not feeling good

And so clear is Homer - so intentional - that Bess can
only reply
BESS
All right Homer

We are ON GROGAN’S LIFELESS FACE as SPLASH Homer throws
a paper cup of water into it

And the old man’s eyelids twitch and ever so slowly
begin to open

The telegraph box is still RATTLING a message that no one
is receiving

As Grogan’s eyes struggle to focus

HOMER

It’s me Mr GroganI didn’t
know you were working today or I
would’ve come down - like I always
doon Sundays

And Grogan tries to shake the confusion from his head

He reaches out and tap-taps the telegraph key - interrupting

the incoming message for a momentlicks his forefinger and
selects a telegram blankinserts it into the typewriter
signals for the telegrapher at the other end to continue

Homer nods
The old man’s gonna be okay

I’1l hurryand get the coffee

And as Grogan begins to type the incoming message
Homer dashes out of the office and we

Grogan is sitting stock still in his chair and
staring straight ahead
But the telegraph box is still RATTLING - the message

Homer grabs the old man by the shoulders and shakes him

HOMER (CONT’D)

to wait a minute

But Grogan is non-responsive

HOMER (CONT’D)

But Grogan just stares at the half-typed telegram still
in the typewriter

And we PUSH IN on the half-typed telegram

DEEP REGRET THAT YOUR SON MARCUS

And Mr Grogan tries to get up from his chair

But he cannot He clutches his chest - clutches at his own
heartand falls forward to rest upon the typewriter
And Homer Macauley comes walking back into the office -
a cup of hot coffee trembling in his hand
And the telegraph box STOPS its RATTLING
HOMER (CONT’D)

Mr Groganwhat’s the matter
Homer sets down the coffee cup and lifts Grogan up off the
typewriter

And Homer sees the half-typed telegram But his
expression does not change

He looks from the message to the face of the old man

HOMER (CONT’D)
Mr Grogan
AUGGIE (OC)
What’s the matter Homer What’s
wrong with the old man
Homer turns to see Auggie standing just inside the door
a bundle of unsold newspapers under his arm

HOMER
He’s dead

AUGGIE
Aw youre crazy -
HOMER
(Almost furious)
No dHe’s dead
Auggie moves in to look at Grogan - sitting up propped
against the back of his chair - his face fixed by death
And Auggie reads the half-typed telegram still in the
typewriter

AUGGIE
It’s not finished Homer Maybe
your brother is only hurtor -
HOMER
No Mr Grogan heard the rest of
the message He didn’t type it
outbut he heard it
And Homer steps away from Auggie and Mr Grogan He looks
around the telegraph office

SPANGLER (0C)
Homer

Spangler is standing in the open door

And as Homer sits in the chair across from Grogan
there are no tears in his eyes He stares straight
ahead at nothing as

AUGGIE

Mr Spangler Somethin’s happened
It’s Mr Grogan Homer says he’s
dead

Spangler moves to Grogan’s side leans overand gently
lifts the old man out of the chairand carries him to
the couch at the back of the office

And the telegraph box starts to RATTLE

SPANGLER
I’1l juststop that

Spangler moves to Grogan’s desksits in Grogan’s chair
taps out a “standby” and “postpone”
Then Spangler sees the half-typed telegram in the
typewriter He looks across the desk at Homer
Auggie utterly confused stands there in the middle of
the SILENCE Finally
AUGGIE
Whatuhwhat shouldI

But he trails off as Homer risesand removes
the unfinished telegram from the typewriter
He separates the original from its carbon copyfiles

the carbon copy in its proper placefolds the original
and slips it into an envelope

And then he takes his Postal Telegraph uniform coat from
its hookputs it ontucks the envelope in the
pocketand puts on his Postal Telegraph hat

Spangler watches all of this in silence then

SPANGLER
Auggie Telephone Dr Nelson -
1133 Tell him to come right down
AUGGIE
Okay Yes sir
SPANGLER
Then call Harry Burke the
telegraph operator Tell him to
come down too
Auggie heads for the telephone and Spangler rises and
puts his arm around Homer
SPANGLER (CONT’D)
Come on Homer

EXT DOWNTOWN ITHACA - DUSK

The sun is going down the sky is turning red the town
is darkening as in SILENCE Homer and Spangler head
past the KINEMA

Spangler’s arm is still around the shoulders of the
young man in the ill-fitting messenger’s uniform

HEY HOMER IT’S HOMER HIYA
HOMER YOU SEEN AUGGIE

ENOCH SHAG NICKIE and ALF
are careening around the corner The gang stop as Homer
greets them - acknowledges them - but keeps walking

HOMER
EnochShagNickieAlf

There is something different about Homer and all that
the gang can do is stand there and watch him move on

And Homer draws a deep breath and asks Spangler
HOMER (CONT’D)
What’s a man supposed to do
Spangler lets the question linger in the Indian summer air

HOMER (CONT’D)

I don’t know who to hate I just
don’t know What can I do about

it

(Pause)
What can I say How does a man go
on living

Homer scoffs out his frustration

HOMER (CONT’D)
I don’t know anybody to hate

As though seeking a candidate Homer looks around the
street - at the PEOPLE of Ithaca strolling downtown on a
Sunday evening

HOMER (CONT’D)
Nothinglike thishas ever
happened to me before When my
father died it was different He
had lived a good life He had
raised a good family We were sad
because he was dead but we
weren’t sore

Homer stops walking and turns to Spangler

HOMER (CONT’ D)
Now I’m sore and I haven’t got
anybody to be sore at Who’s the
enemy Do you know

Spangler looks aroundlooks down the street at

THE COURTHOUSE PARK
- the swath of green leading to the modest
COURTHOUSE

SPANGLER
It isn’t people

yet stately

Spangler holds Homer’s gaze for a moment then continues
to walk toward the Courthouse Park and Homer falls in

step with him

SPANGLER (CONT’D)
The people of the world are like

»one person If you hate people

»it’s only yourself that
you hate
(Pause)

And Homer I have to believe that
your brother - that Marcus - isn’t
really gone He’s in youin your

little brother -

HOMER
No

Homer stops dead in his tracks and challenges Spangler

man-to-man

HOMER (CONT’D)
That isn’t good enough I want to
see him I want tosmell him I
want to hear his voice hear him

laughing and have fights with him

No Everything’s different now
Something good has gone out of
everythingand this place

everything in Ithaca has changed

because my brother isn’t going
to look at anything anymore

Homer pauses

HOMER (CONT’D)
My brother is dead

And Homer spits - viciously - onto the ground

Spangler nods He looks away and his gaze comes to rest on

AN IRON STAKE

stuck in the ground We are

EXT COURTHOUSE PARK - DUSK

SPANGLER

Okay I’m not gonna to try to
comfort you Because I can’t
Buttry to rememberthat the
best part of a good man stays It
stays forever Homer

Homer looks at Spangler
SPANGLER (CONT’D)
Are you any good at horseshoes
Homer looks at the iron stake and we REVEAL through his
eyes another stake 40 feet away
HOMER
No sir Not very

SPANGLER

Neither am I You wanna pitch a
game before it’s too dark

CUT TO

THE IRON STAKE

as a HORSESHOE CLANGS into it spins and settles A
ringer And we CUT WIDE to REVEAL

EXT COURTHOUSE PARK - HORSESHOE PIT - MOMENTS LATER

It’s really too dark now for a game but Spangler pitches
another oneand the two men walk from one end of the pit
to the otherand Homer takes up the horseshoes

He swings oncetwiceand releases on the third and
the horseshoe fliestrue and straightCLANKonly to
glance off the stake and land in the dirt

But Homer is startled to see
A SOLDIER

standing there leaning against the low fence at the and
of the pit

Spangler follows Homer’s gaze squints through the twilight
at the man who Homer is now approaching

HOMER
Do I know you

But the Soldier does not reply

And we do not see his face Darkness has fallen and it
is important that this man is anonymous

He is just another soldier His name is unimportant His
face is unimportant
HOMER (CONT’D)
Would you care to pitch a

game You can take my place
It’s a little dark -

SOLDIER
No Thanks You go ahead I’11
just watch

HOMER

I don’t think I’ve seen you before
Is thisis Ithaca your town

SOLDIER
Yes And I’m here To stay

HOMER
You mean you don’t have to
go back

SOLDIER

No They’ve sent me home For

HOMER
Wellyou should go home Your
family -

SOLDIER

I will Little my little Right
nowI just can’t believe I’m
really here So I’11l walk around
some moreand then I’11 go home

The Soldier nods to Homer there in the darkness turns
and walks away - limps away - for one of his legs is stiff
as a board It might even be a prosthetic

Homer and Spangler watch the young man limp away

HOMER
I thought I knew that man

Homer looks up at Spangler

HOMER (CONT’D)
I don’t feel like pitching
any more Mr Spangler

SPANGLER
All right Homer

HOMER

What am I going to tell them
They’ re waiting for me at home
How am I going to look at them
They’1l1 know the minute they

Spangler places a comforting hand on Homer’s shoulder

And Bess begins to play “I’LL BE SEEING YOU” tentatively
at first Then she makes a mistake
BESS
Oh no

And she does
ULYSSES

He’11 be home soon

And the CAMERA starts to pull backaway from the parlor

Bess playsMary daydreamsMrs Macauley continues to
knitand Ulysses looks at the pictures on the final
page of the body-building booklet

Suddenly Ulysses frowns at something
He gets up off the floor and moves to the open front door

And Bess ends with a slow arpeggio smiles up at
Maryand notices Ulysses - standing in the open front
door and pointing at something

MRS MACAULEY

That was beautiful Bess

But Bess has joined Ulysses

BESS
Masomebody’sthere’s a man
sitting on our front-porch steps
Mrs Macauley stops knitting Her heart might have skipped
a beatbut we would never know it

She lifts her knitting and continues as though there
is nothing to be afraid of
MRS MACAULEY (CONT’D)
Go on out to him Bess and ask
him in - whoever he is

EXT MACAULEY HOME - FRONT PORCH - SAME
We are ON BESS as she steps out onto the front-porch
and asks

BESS
Won’twon’t you come in

Without getting up the Soldier turns to look up at her
And so it is that we do not see his face because it
is unimportant right now

BESS (CONT’D)
My mother would like you to come in

And we are ON BESS as quietly

And the Soldier stands - with some difficulty - and
faces Bess (faces away from us) He reaches into the
pocket of his Class A uniform and withdraws A RING
SOLDIER
Bess Your brother Marcussent
you this

Bess reaches out and takes the ring And her voice is
small when she asks
BESS
Is Marcus dead

And then she sees
HOMER
walking down the street and toward the house

And rather than hear the Soldier’s answer Bess dashes
past him down the front-porch steps and to her brother
BESS (CONT’D)
Homer He’s come from Marcus
They were friends
And we are ON HOMER as he looks up and sees the Soldier
for the second time that night but this time he says
HOMER
Tobey
And the Soldier limps down a few steps to the street - to
stand in the HALO of the STREET LAMP He is of course
TOBEY GEORGE

And Bess doesn’t know what to do So she runs up the
front-porch steps and into the house
HOMER (CONT’D)
I thought I knew you when we
talked in the park
And Homer offers Tobey his hand The soldier takes it And
Homer waits a moment before he says
HOMER (CONT’D)

The telegram came this afternoon
I have it In my pocket Here

And Homer pulls the telegram from his pocket

Homer and Tobey stare at one another fora
momentthen Homer looks up to see his mother -

MRS MACAULEY
standing on the front-porch and looking downat
THE TELEGRAM

in Homer’s hand

Homer waitsuntil his mother’s eyes meet his own
And Homer tears the telegram into pieces
And as Bess and Mary appear at the open door Homer
puts the pieces back into his pocket
Ulysses comes running down the front-porch steps and
pauses to look up at Tobey
Then the youngest Macauley takes the soldier by the hand
HOMER
C’mon Come on in
And Homer and Ulysses lead Tobey up the front-porch
steps They stop in front of Mrs Macauley
HOMER (CONT’D)
The soldier’s come home ma
And Mrs Macauley looks at her two remaining sons one
on each side of the soldier named Tobey
She wipes the tears from her eyesand smiles It is
a smile which says Yes to all things

MRS MACAULEY
Won’t you please come in And let
us show youaround the house

And Tobey and his two brothers move into the warmth
and light of home

THE END
