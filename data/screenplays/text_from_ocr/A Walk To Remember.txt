ring system

WIDEN

LANDON

Saturn Beautiful

JAMIE
Before Voyager we expected maybe a
dozen rings --

LANDON
But there are thousands of them
made of floating ice --

( )

JAMIE
Maybe debris from a moon that
broke apart

LANDON
Or building blocks for a world
that never formed

She looks at him He smiles embarrassed

LANDON
Im not smart Just a sponge

She smiles disagreeing then looks through the telescope
and changes its view

JAMIE
Sometimes I come here and just
scan the heavens

LANDON
(joking)
Looking for intelligent life
JAMIE
Looking for something -- someone

Pause He doesnt know what to say

LANDON
Do you believe youll see your
mother again

Like in a church painting I see
this giant hovering over the
ground Hes wearing a robe and
has long flowing hair and hes
pointing his finger at something
JAMIE
Do you ever wonder why things
happen the way they do

LANDON
No

( )

Pause

He sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back
pocket He holds one out to her

takes it

JAMIE
I know theres a plan for
everyone but sometimes I dont
understand what the message is --
or what the point is

LANDON
There is no point You live You
die The end

JAMIE
Maybe were not supposed to
understand but were supposed to
have faith that someone else sees
the big picture

LANDON
You have to believe to have faith

JAMIE
You dont believe in anything

LANDON
The Bible Why should I read a
bunch of dumb stories about some
ancient guy who supposedly worked
miracles

JAMIE
Interpreted by another guy like my
father

LANDON
Your father doesnt like me

JAMIE
He doesnt trust you

LANDON
Sometimes I dont even trust me

JAMIE
Im not afraid of you

Love is always patient and kind
It is never jealous Love is
never boastful or conceited It
is never rude or selfish It does
not take offense and is not
resentful Love takes no pleasure
in other peoples sins but
delights in the truth It is
always ready to excuse to trust
to hope and to endure whatever
comes’
