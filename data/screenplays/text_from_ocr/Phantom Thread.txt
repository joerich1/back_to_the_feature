I made this dress for her when I

ALMA
It’s beautiful she’s beautiful

REYNOLDS
This was for her second husband
for the wedding My father had died many
years beforeWe lived with a evil Nanny
Blackwood who because of superstition
wouldnt help me sew the dress — she believed
it would bring her bad fortune to never be a
bride not that anyone would have had her she
seemed ancient to us — I dont know how old
she was - so I sewed alone for months and
monthssweating and sewing hunched over

Hateful Nanny Blackwood never married anyway
(all the help I could have had from her)

I shaped the form of it on my Sister
my first mannequin

There are endless superstitions when making a
wedding dress Girls afraid they will never
marry if they touch it models afraid they’1l
marry only bald men if they wear the dress

CU PHOTOGRAPH The dress is beautiful

ALMA
Where is the dress now

REYNOLDS
