Maybe its a masculine thing
They say women dont care Im
sort of in the middle myself
How about you

ALEX
I beg your pardon

DARYL
You see women are in touch with
different things Thats my
opinion I know thats not a
fashionable opinion right now
but fuck it I know what I see
I see men running around dipping
their dicks into every little
thing trying to make things
happen But its women who have
the real power isnt it Women
are the source the only power
Nature Birth Re-birth Cliche
cliche Sure But true

ALEX
Why are you telling me all this

DARYL
Because youre an honest woman
And Im being honest with you I
like women I respect them If
you want me to talk to you like
youre a dumb twit I will But
whats the point You have brains
Alex More than brains You have
power And you dont even know
it do you Well most women
dont

ALEX
Were you ever married

DARYL
Good question You see Brains
The answer is no Dont believe in
it Good for the man Lousy for
the woman She suffocates She
dies Ive seen it And then the
husband runs around complaining
that hes fucking a dead person
And hes the one that killed her
Wheres your husband 114

ALEX
Dead

DARYL
Well sorry but youre one of
the lucky ones When a woman
unloads a husband -- or when a
husband unloads a woman -- however
it happens -- death desertion
divorce -- the three ds --
when it happens a woman blossoms
Blooms Like flowers Like
fruit She is ripe Talk about
power Thats the woman for me
Would you like to see my bedroom

moving through the cavernous rooms of the house They
are sparsely furnished Some are empty Some have
painters working A carpenter seems to appear from
nowhere and then disappear Daryl babbles on giving
Alex a tour of his belongings CAMERA INCLUDES every-
thing he mentions but is always MOVING producing a
DIZZY EFFECT like the effect Daryl is having on Alex
Occassionally she responds with some polite noise But
she is disconnected as if falling under a spell

DARYL

The lab is over there past
the pianos used to be a ballroom
-- nice word ballroom -- nothing
to see right now equipment crates

Over there the study have to
unpack my books some of the old
sets have to wait need an air-

modern sculpture

concocted of chicken wire flattened beer cans an old
porcelain chamber pot for her belly pieces of chrome
car bumper items of underwear stiffened with lacquer
and glue Her face is that of a plaster doll China-
blue eyes and pink-painted cheeks cut off and fixed to
a block of wood

what I think is a very big talent
on those little poppets of yours

INT BEDROOM - ALEX AND DARYL 119

coming into the room Everything is black -- walls
floor ceiling furnishings curtains carpets sheets
on the bed even a black clock with black hands and
numbers that are virtually impossible to read As Daryl
speaks Fidel enters the room He is carrying a black
silk bathrobe Unself-consciously Daryl slips out of
his clothing and into the robe -- with Fidels assis-
tance Alex stands watching all this

DARYL
The sheets are black too
Hard to find What they call
black is really navy blue These
are black And the lacquer work
only two people in New York do
this kind of work Course you
pay with your soul but hell

Fidel turns down the bed and Daryl gets into it Fidel
draws the curtains against the light and then silently
leaves the room closing the door behind him

DARYL
(continuing)
-- This is my bedroom I deserve

DARYL
No I wouldnt dream of seducing

as trivial as seduction But I
would love to fuck you

CLOSE ON ALEX 120

ALEX
I do appreciate your directness
Daryl And I will try to be
direct and honest with you too
I think no I know I am
absolutely sure that you are the
most unattractive man I have ever
met You are vulgar stupid
insensitive selfish egotistical
you have no taste a lousy sense
of humor and you smell You are
physically repulsive intellectually
retarded and morally reprehensible
In the short time that we have been
together you have demonstrated
every loathsome characteristic of
the male personality and even
discovered a few new ones You are
a creep A jerk You are not
clean And youre not even
interesting enough to make me
sick Understood

Century -- it was started by the
medical profession Thats right
They were trying to get the
childbirth business out of the
hands of the midwives Most of
the women who were burned thats
what they were Midwives

JANE
Is that true
DARYL
Trust me Its just another example

of masculine supremacy An effort
-- successful as it turned out --
to suppress the natural power of
women And make a profit off them
at the same time Using women for
their own selfish purposes Men

is white and sparse the skin is blotched hanging
heavily off her cheeks and neck the breasts are huge
and sagging Alex sees herself in the mirror But be-
fore she can react the transformation continues at a
faster rate She touches her hair and pieces of it fall
off and shed in her hands The bones in her hands knot
and protrude under the skin The skin changes color
And then real disintegration begins -- as if she were a
corpse and her body were rotting Finally she screams
But the sound is inhuman It is the sound of a corpse
screaming

is still spitting feathers when a fierce wind suddenly
blows up around him Daryl is knocked to the ground
He struggles to stand up But the wind is of hurricane
force and it literally blows him down the street

368

People scatter and run for cover as trees fall and cars
are overturned but the wind is focused on Daryl as he
stumbles trips falls and rolls -- trying desperately to
get to some shelter Blinded by the whirling dust he
gropes his way toward a building He feels his way along
the side of the building until he finds a door He opens
it and the wind blows him into

INT CHURCH - DAY 369

Daryl is as surprised as we are to see where he is A
service was in progress until the great wind blew through
the doors The congregation and the minister back toward
the walls Daryl turns to face the wind Summoning up
all his strength he fights his way to the doors and
gathering superhuman power he pushes them closed The
WIND POUNDS at the building but for the moment Daryl
has escaped it He catches his breath He is bruised
badly his clothing is torn and shredded and he is still
hurting from the pain of the pins Finally he takes

in the terrified congregation He smiles

DARYL
Sorry uh having a little
trouble having a little trouble

at home A little domestic
situation No need to be alarmed
A little female trouble thats
all Hi How are you

He laughs as he moves unsteadily up the aisle The
congregation continues to move away from him The
minister steers people toward the back of the church

DARYL
(continuing)
Women Ha Cant live with them

He doubles over suddenly gags opens his mouth and a
stream of grapes comes out of it The congregation
is amazed Daryl recovers

DARYL
(continuing)

Pay no attention Pay no
attention Cheap trick Anybody

Ungrateful little bitches arent

DARYL (CONTD)
Let me ask you -- do you think God
knew what he was doing when he
created women Huh No shit I
want to know Do you think he
knew or do you think it was another
of his little mistakes Like
earthquakes and floods Volcanos
Tidal waves Just another little
fuck-up in the divine plan Like
cancer Do you think women are
like that

He gags and spits out more feathers and grapes The WIND
ROARS outside the church Daryl is having a harder time
recovering from these fits and attacks

DARYL

(continuing)
Whats the matter You dont think
God makes mistakes Sure he does
We all make mistakes Course we
make mistakes and they call it
evil God makes mistakes and they
call it nature So what do you
think Women A mistake Or did
he do it to us on purpose Id
like to know Because if its
a mistake maybe we could do
something about it Find a cure
A vaccine Build up the immune
system Eat broccoli Geta
little exercise Maybe thats all
it would take Twenty pushups a
day and youll never be afflicted
with women again

An excruciating pain pierces his brain He grabs his
head falls to his knees While hes down the congrega-
tion moves toward the doors and opens them The wind

rushes in The people fight their way out of the church

changing shapes as if an internal force were trying to
burst through his skin
