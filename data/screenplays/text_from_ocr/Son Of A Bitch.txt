INT ESME’S CAR- AFTERNOON 1

A girl’s blue glossy nail polished finger pushes the ‘scan’
button on a police scanner

POLICE SCANNER
Er ah we’ve got a stolen truck on
Swanson and 5th plate number

Blue fingernail pushes button on scanner again

ADRIANNA (0S)

(whiny )
C’mon Twice is enough I’m super
hungry
ESME (0S)
(serious)

One more I feel like the next one
will be epic Trust me this is my
thing

ANGLE ON ESME (24 hot witty blue fingernails the whole
package) in the driver’s seat ADRIANNA (25 classic good
looks Esme’s best friend) holding a video camera in the
passenger seat The car has a smoky haze

POLICE SCANNER
Disturbance call at 1556 Henderson
Drive

ESME
OH MY GOD THAT’S AROUND THE CORNER

EXT ESME’S CAR — CONTINUOUS 2

Esme’s old Volvo peels away from the curb out of the parking
lot and around the corner The car pulls in front of a crappy
house

EXT IN FRONT OF RUN DOWN HOUSE - SAME TIME 3

Esme gets out of the car Adrianna follows Adrianna has her
video camera ready to shoot We hear SIRENS getting closer
Esme lights a cigarette and stands in front of the steps to
the front door of the house casually but really dorky
trying to be ‘casual’ She ADJUSTS her ‘casual’ stance until
she thinks she gets it just right You can hear shouting in
the house
ESME
Roll it Adrianna

A police car pulls up parks and two officers get out of the
car The older cop walks past Esme totally ignoring her The
younger cop BERNIE (27 sweet ‘good cop’) looks annoyed
Esme pulls her sunglasses down

ESME (CONT’D)
You boys got this under control

BERNIE
(flustered)
Ma’am if you keep showing up on
our calls like this

Another police car arrives

BERNIE (CONTD)
It’s just not a safe thing to
do You’re going to get yourself
into trouble

ESME
I just want to make sure you guys
have this under control I’m not
doing anything illegal You should
know that you’re the law

CUT TO
Main titles over black SON OF A BITCH

Suddenly a deranged looking SKINNY NAKED WHITE MAN bursts out
of the house screaming A BLACK MAN comes out of the house
screaming A FAT NAKED BLACK WOMAN in pursuit swinging a
cane They RUN past the police Esme and Adrianna and chase
each other around the yard Bernie yells motioning for a
laughing Esme and Adrianna to leave as he grabs the fat
woman His face gets squashed in her chest as she jumps up
and down yelling at the men Esme and Adrianna still
taping jump in Esme’s car The naked white man throws
himself into the backseat of the cop car and shuts the door
on the black man who then beats on the car door The older
police officer grabs him

INT ESME AND SETH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 4

ANGLE ON Esme’s blue glossy nail-polished fingers and they
cautiously press keys on her laptop and scroll on the mouse
pad

We see the computer screen where she is dragging black lines
onto faces and blurring genitals of a SKINNY NAKED WHITE MAN
with a video editing program
We see video uploading symbol

Esme posts the video live on her blog “PARTY GIRL”
Instantly the comments appear

Comments scroll up the computer screen
“FIRST ”

“FIRST ”

“FIRST”

“Aw Wasnt first”

““ hahaha”

“LOVE when you do these vids Party Girl”
“Party Girl RULES”

‘Marry me”

“You look fat”

Esme types FUCK YOU

SETH (0S)
Esme

ANGLE ON SETH (28 funny familiar handsome Esme’s husband)
totally stoned in his underwear laying beside Esme on the
bed with a plate full of burritos on his stomach The bedroom
is a mess

SETH (CONTD)
How do blind people know there is
braille on signs

ESME
(I don’t know)
They just do

Esme puts her computer down and takes the plate of burritos

SETH
I mean there are signs all over
the place but how do they know
there is braille on some of them
How do they know the sign is even
there

ESME
(contemplating)
Maybe they just touch stuff all the
time until something makes sense

SETH
I bet all of those braille signs
say “How did you know this was
here”
ESME
I have the smartest husband of all
time which is good because I
didn’t spend the afternoon looking
for a new job

SETH

It’s okay bills are almost paid up

and if worst comes to worst I could

sell this ass on the street all

day
Seth stands up on the bed in his underwear struttin’ his
ass not very sexy Esme pulls him back down on the bed and
kisses him

INT ESME AND SETH’S LIVING ROOM - NEXT AFTERNOON 5

Esme and Adrianna sit on the couch with Rose (25 no filter
new agey) Adrianna goes through the packages on the end of
the couch They are drinking beer and getting stoned The
living room is a mess

ADRIANNA
So people are sending you this
stuff for free and all you have to
do is talk about it on your blog

Adrianna opens a box and takes out a necklace that says
“Esme”

ESME
Yes

ADRIANNA
Jesus why does anyone even bother
going to school anymore

ESME
A necklace won’t pay our mortgage

Rose gets up from the couch and does the “Maury Povich
Babydance”

ROSE
(yelling like a black man)
I TOLD YOU DAMN I TOLD YOU GURL I
DON’T LOOK LIKE THAT BABY

Rose points to the photo of the Maury baby on the TV screen
ROSE (CONTD)
HE GOTS GREEN-EYES WHA WHA I
KNEW IT

ESME
One day I’ll be so right about
something I’1ll get to do the Maury
baby dance

ADRIANNA
(tokes on joint)
I prefer the sexy decoy episodes

ROSE
What’s that

ESME
(so into it)
Maury follows these horn dog
boyfriends who are suspected
cheaters then he unleashes a
totally hot chick on the guy

Esme takes a hit off the joint passes it to Rose She holds
the smoke in her lungs as she talks

ESME (CONTD)
This girl is the SEXY DECOY and her
job is to go in and totally hit on
this weirdo guy until he makes out
with her or feels her tits
Whatever She’s bait A plant

Adrianna changes the channel INTERVENTION is on

ADRIANNA
I always feel like I’m going to
know someone on this show

Man on Intervention is speaking with a thick southern
Carolina accent and there are English subtitles on the screen
to help decipher what he is saying

ESME
I love English speaking people who
need English subtitles to be
understood They’re my spirit
animals

Rose sits at Esme’s computer
ROSE
The naked guy video is a hit you
have over a thousand comments
That’s insane

ESME
What Crazy I loaded it last
night

ROSE

You’re so much more popular in the
computer than you are in real life

ADRIANNA
It would be so great if you made a
billion dollars online by doing
this comedy stuff and Seth could
quit his cubicle job and you could
buy us a villa to live in in
Mexico

ROSE
(casually)
I can’t go back to Mexico

ESME
(stoned thinking out
loud)
Let’s take the subway to the
Science Center and watch the Led
Zeppelin laser show

INT SCIENCE CENTER LASER DOME - LATER 6

Led Zeppelin guitar solo plays Esme Adrianna and Rose all
sit beside each other in a row of seats inside the laser
dome

ESME
THESE LASERS SUCK

INT SCIENCE CENTER LOBBY - FEW MINUTES LATER 7

WIDE ANGLE ON The three girls Adrianna Rose Esme in the
middle POV of the person Esme is talking to The girls look
very stoned

ESME
Fifteen dollars a ticket To me
fifteen dollars for a laser show
kind of sounds like a guarantee
that the lasers in the shows are
going to be some next level shit
(MORE)

ESME (CONTD)
I mean you’re pretty much assuring
the customers that “HEY take the
sphinx’s laser eyes from the
Neverending Story every light
sabre in Star Wars one through six
and every single laser from school
photo backgrounds in the 1980’s and
multiply it to the power of
infinity- that’s the quality and
quantity of lasers we’re going to
give you For fifteen dollars”

ANGLE ON Dumb looking Science Center worker Esme has been
talking to

SCIENCE CENTER WORKER
(beat monotone)

INT SCIENCE CENTER LASER DOME - FEW MINUTES LATER 8

SONG - “D’yer Maker” - by Led Zeppelin

THE LASERS ARE INSANE Esme Rose and Adrianna walk into the
dome and stop to behold the amazing laser production before
them Esme turns and faces Rose and Adrianna holding her
arms out

ESME
SEE THESE LASERS ARE IN-SANE
THESE ARE LASERS THAT ARE WORTH
FIFTEEN

Esme gets hit in the face with a laser Esme INSTANTLY
vomits Adrianna starts to film Esme puking with her iPhone
Esme grabs the back of a chair to steady herself and pukes
again She’s a puke machine People in the dome scramble
through the lasers and away from her Lasers are still going
insane This is a pukefest

EXT SCIENCE CENTER LASER DOME - LATER 9

The girls are standing on the sidewalk Esme is in between
Rose and Adrianna they are rubbing her shoulders A car
pulls up in front of them

INT MATT’S CAR - NIGHT 10

Seth sits in the passenger seat with MATT (28 nerdy
handsome Adrianna’s husband) behind the wheel Rose
Adrianna and Esme climb into the backseat Esme looks rough
Seth and Matt are laughing
SETH
(laughing)
I can’t believe you started a
barforama to D’yer Mak’er That’s
got to be the greatest goddamn
barfing song ever I wish I could
have been there

Adrianna reaches over the passenger seat with her iPhone and
plays back the video she shot of Esme puking for Seth

SETH (CONTD)
(horrified)
I take that back I take it back

ESME
(to Adrianna)
Did you email that video to me yet

ADRIANNA
Of course
(to Matt)
Oh my God can you turn off the
Slayer is’s stupid

Not taking his eyes off the road Matt reaches over puts his
hand on Adrianna’s head and pushes her back to her seat

MATT
(to Seth)
You did not hear my bride just say
Slayer is stupid she’s just
nervous because I’m about to take
her home and make her try on her
school girl uniform

SETH
(matter of fact)
Ruffle panties and knee highs

ESME

MATT
Speaking of High School dropouts

Seth turns around quickly and faces the girls in the
backseat

SETH
(SHOCKED to Rose)
Your boyfriend is ISHO THE PUSHUP
GUY

ROSE
Yeah

SETH
Holy shit that guy is amazing I
watched that guy do 300 push ups in
a row I really don’t think there
is anyone stronger

ROSE
I met him while I was busking
downtown doing my trumpet and
tapdancing thing

MATT
Do you lay on top of him while he
does push-ups Please tell me you
do that

ESME
Doesn’t anybody care that I just
threw up all over a bunch of Led
Zeppelin fans I think I have
fucking epilepsy

Seth pulls out his keychain on the chain is a tiny
flashlight He turns it to strobe and puts it in Esme’s face

SETH
I can diagnose you right here look
into the flashlight

EXT SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF ESME AND SETH’S HOUSE - NIGHT 11

‘crinkle sound’ A Sikh doctor wearing a turban walks into
the room holding Esme’s medical file

ESME
So I’m pretty sure I have epilepsy
and I’m really upset about it

SIKH DOCTOR
Well

ESME
I really hate that I have epilepsy
because I love dance clubs and
laser shows and really don’t want
to give either up Let’s order an
ECG and get this over with

SIKH DOCTOR
Esme you’re pregnant

Esme shifts her weight on the bed The paper under her makes
crinkle noises

(quietly)
Is this is like the time you told
me you thought my appendix was
swollen so you could put your
finger up my butt

SIKH DOCTOR
How far along do you think you are

ESME
I didn’t even know I was pregnant
so how would I know that

(MORE)

ESME (CONTD)
(to self)
How could this happen he pulls out

contraception

SIKH DOCTOR
Lay back please I just want to
palpate your uterus

ESME
(to herself)
You’re kidding me right This is
just like the appendix

SIKH DOCTOR
When was your last cycle

ESME
I don’t know They’re irregular

The doctor presses on her lower abdomen

SIKH DOCTOR
It feels like you are quite far
along

The doctor helps her sit back up

ESME
(visibly upset)
How far along Could I have been
one of those women who has a baby
in a toilet in McDonalds

SIKH DOCTOR
I’m just estimating but your
fundus is quite high Some people
carry deeper inside of their
abdomen than others Id say you
are roughly three or four months
pregnant

ESME
Just to be clear here pregnant-—
with-a-baby

SIKH DOCTOR
Here is some information for you
about pregnancy You’re going to
need to see your Ob-Gyn and start
your pre-natal care immediately

I don’t have an Ob-Gyn

Doctor picks up package of paper and gives it to Esme Esme
looks at the large package

He’s doing a lot better now that he
has a prosthetic hand and no one is
calling him Captain Hook He still
goes a little loco when he sees a
pirate So Esme I’m not sure but
do you have a full time job Aside
from the blog

ESME
It’s kind of hard to keep a job
when you prank people like your
employers

Pippa passes Esme a stack of papers

PIPPA
Your blog has been creating a lot
of buzz Links to your stuff by
Buzzfeed YouTube and Reddit have
upped your unique hits by 800 in
just the last two weeks alone
Having two videos go viral ina
twenty four hour period is pretty
big stuff

barf fests It’s a pretty good time
to be alive

EARL

Esme it’s time to hit the next
level Are you ready for your life
to change Your life could change
today

ESME

EARL
(calming himself)

group of pregnant couples who are on yoga mats on the floor

her chest like she is breast-feeding

ESME
(to Seth)

My favorite breast-feeding position
is called the football hold

SETH

All of the women do the hold with the doll to their breasts
Esme sarcastically lamely shoves the doll under her shirt
holding it by the feet Keltie approaches her

KELTIE (CONTD)

ESME
Oh it’s latched

Keltie pulls the doll out from under Esme’s shirt and presses
the doll’s face into Esme’s boob Keltie’s face is right

staring)
Yeaaaahhh that’s it Right there

Keltie grabs Esme’s hand and puts it on Esme’s boob and
massages her boob via Esme’s hand Esme is containing her
horror

KELTIE (CONTD)
Sometimes you gotta massage to get
the milk to let down There’s a
reason it’s called milk
ejaculation

Keltie moves on to the next couple Esme hits Seth and looks
bewildered

ESME
(whispering)
I don’t think it’s called that You
totally let her sexually assault me
again

I’m sorry you’re right This was
way more assault-y than when she
spread your thighs with her knees
A definite 8 on a scale of 10 as
far as assault goes I know I took
the seminar

ESME
Nope

ANDRA
(looking at Judd)
Oh he’s so cute I’m Andra

ESME
Esme I’m tired

TORI
Esme Andra is a single Mom so you
probably shouldn’t talk to her
about being tired

ANDRA
(to Esme)
She’s kidding You can talk to me
about that stuff It actually makes
me feel better knowing that it’s
just as hard with two parents

Tori’s baby begins to cry

flowers all over it and has pierced ears

TORI
Locklyn Grace

ESME

you wanted one Is she wearing
blush

Tori’s baby stops crying

TORI

Esme turns some music
ESME (CONTD)
Inspiration music We’re gonna do

this

Esme sings the song and dances to Judd as she gets him into a
bunch of weird positions to sit She starts to prop him with
pillows

SETH (0S)
Where is my baby Where is my baby

ESME
We’re in the bedroom

Esme turns off the music Seth comes in the room
ESME (CONTD)
Did you know that Judd is supposed
to be sitting soon or like now

SETH
He’s only four and a half months
he’1ll sit at five or six months

ESME
Well apparently some hobo woman had
a baby who could sit at four
months

SETH
So he’s just that now

ESME
I’m still worried he might have a
touch of downs because of the

Esme makes a weed ‘toke’ action with her hand
ESME (CONTD)

If I can get him to sit early then
I’ll totally stop worrying about

it
SETH
A touch of downs
ESME
Syndrome
SETH

Esme you know how sometimes you
blog stuff and get a bad reaction
because it isn’t funny That down’s
thing isn’t funny

ESME

I’m not trying to be funny I’m-
dead-seriously-worried Touch of
down’s is possible And A HOBO’S
BABY SAT AT FOUR MONTHS I can’t
live knowing that her baby was more
advanced than mine It’s like a
suicide note

SETH
First of all I can’t believe youre
in a baby competition with a HOBO’S
BABY instead of a classmate’s baby

Seth grabs a “Bumbo” out of the closet

SETH (CONTD)
And second of all this is for early
sitting Put him in this and he can
sit

ESME
(like showing a nun porn)
I’m not using that thing It’s
horrible That’s what hospitals use
for babies with spina bifida That
seat is cheating I hate it

SETH
I’m putting him in it

ESME
Don’t Don’t you dare put him in
it I don’t want to see him in it
He’1l look stupid and helpless

Esme tries to wrestle Seth for the Bumbo Seth cannot be
stopped Esme covers her eyes Seth puts Judd in the Bumbo
Judd looks pathetic

ESME (CONT’D)
I can’t even He looks like an
idiot

We see Seth in the Bumbo looking like a total gaylord

SETH
You’re right

Esme takes Seth out of the Bumbo and Seth tosses it in the
hall

SETH (CONTD)
(just to win one argument)
AND ‘Touch of down’s’ isn’t a
thing

ESME
I just made it a thing Just like I
made ‘Shit-ton’ and ‘skinny-fat’
things That’s my job

SETH
Look Judd gets plenty of core
activity and strength from that
dance class That’s why I signed
you up for it Don’t worry so much

ESME
We haven’t been going to that dance
class

SETH

Are you kidding me

ESME
Not even a little bit It was like
SO WEIRD pretending that your baby
could dance Babies are terrible
dancers Seth

SETH

I would kill to be able to go to
that dance class with Judd

(to Judd)
Right Judd We’d just do a little
breakdancing and we’d sing some
songs I could help you flirt with
the babies But only the really
cute babies

ESME
Fine you go to the class with Judd
and do all of this because clearly
I’m really bad at it

SETH
No you aren’t You just have to
accept that Judd is your boss

Esme crosses her arms

ESME
No he isn’t

SETH
He is your boss

ESME
No he isn’t

SETH
He is the boss of you He totally
is

ESME

(defeated)

Seth makes some noises to show he is waking up

ESME (CONT’D)
(to herself at Seth)
I like being a Mom better when you
guys are sleeping and that makes me
feel like such a bitch

Seth sits up half asleep Mumbling

SETH
Youre a bit of a bitch it’s okay
I love you You know I’d like to
take you to a country where I
legally own you I would do it I
would clone you too so I’d own two
wives They do that in those
countries

ESME
Cmon

Esme helps him up off the couch and they walk down the hall

together We hear Judd wake up and start crying Esme puts
her head in her hands and walks into his room

INT ESME’S MOM’S HOUSE - DAY 89

Esme follows Caroline who is carrying Judd into the TV
room There are packed bags The room is decorated very
‘Roseanne’ but more patriotic Dr Oz is on TV Caroline sits
with Judd on her lap rocking on the rocking chair

ESME
What do you mean you’re leaving

CAROLINE
Esme my lungs don’t like the air
here And all of my political
friends are in Phoenix

ESME
Mom you’re not friends with Martin
Luther King and the air is dry as
shit in Phoenix Why are you
abandoning me

Esme spaces out watching Dr Oz On TV

CAROLINE
No one is abandoning you Just
going to the condo is all
(MORE)
CAROLINE (CONTD)
Don’t worry Ill be here for
Judd’s party I love that this
Ukrainian party was a lie it’s
going to be so much fun I’m going
to sew Judd a little king costume
like King Friday’s from Mr Rogers

ESME
Don’t put any American Flags on it

CAROLINE
Why are you so ashamed of your
country Esme You’re so elitist

ESME
I love Dr Oz Even though he’s so
clinical about the body he really
seems like he’d be good in bed

CAROLINE
Do you have postpartum

Esme stops looking at Dr Oz and turns to Caroline

ESME
No

CAROLINE
You’re talking about having sex
with Dr Oz That’s got to be
postpartum

ESME
I don’t have postpartum

CAROLINE
I had postpartum and it was
terrible You’re so lucky I didn’t
shake you I’m surprised more
parents don’t shake their kids

ESME
Mom

CAROLINE
I’‘1l stay if you have postpartum I
don’t want you to drive across the
state line like Marie Osmond did
after she had her seventeenth kid
bless her heart

ESME
I don’t think she had that many
kids

CAROLINE
Do you want to see the material for
the robe I’ve made for Judd No
no I’1ll save it as a surprise Is
Judd sitting

ESME
No he still isn’t sitting

Esme goes back to looking at Dr Oz

CAROLINE
It’s probably because you brought
him everywhere in that car seat
because you were afraid to pick him
up in public You should have used
the Bumbo I bought you

ESME
It isn’t because I didn’t use the
Bumbo

CAROLINE

Gross Stop looking at Dr Oz all
lusty like that

Esme is looking at Dr Oz on the TV TIGHT SHOT on his face
which is kind of doing sensual things TIGHT SHOT on Esme
nodding as though her comment about him being good in bed has
been validated

Esme sits across from Pippa and the men

EARL
You want a water Coke Diet Coke

Smart Fizz didn’t pass FDA

tumors skin tags good thing you

Pippa rubs bandage on her neck

ESME
Water is fine Nursing a hangover

Grey Goose

The two identical business guys stand up they are smiling
they shake Esme’s hand Everyone sits down

CHRIS
We love what you do The Led
Zeppelin pukefest is still my all-
time favorite

PIPPA
(excited)
They love it

EARL
Sorry about the last minute call in
here

ESME
It’s fine

EARL

I’m sure you realize it’s about the
blog post from last night We
noticed your traffic went up which
is what we’ve been waiting for for
the last few months Hits on your
site went up 995

ESME
(being cute)
That’s not a real number

Everyone but Esme laughs uncomfortably

EARL
Anyhow wed hoped it had gone up
from a prank or funny photo but it
was because someone outed you as a
Mom

ESME
Crazy right
EARL
The kid in those photos is your
nephew right I recognized him
from the grocery store

TIM
(fake laughing)
I mean we couldn’t fire you for
being a Mom

PIPPA
Obviously

TIM
(fake laughing stops)
But it would ruin the campaign if
everyone found out America’s ‘Party
Girl’ was a liar mom

ESME
Yeah right Of course well no
worries here

CHRIS
(To Tim)
I can’t believe you thought there
was a possibility of this being
true Look at her she’s hot She’s
not a Mom Sorry Pippa

Esme and Pippa look slightly annoyed

CHRIS (CONTD)

(to Esme)
I mean you don’t look like a
Mom
EARL

Esme you did look cute in those
photos with your nephew but you
don’t have a maternal bone in your
body I saw you with him in that
sling at the grocery store and you
two were not connected at all

ESME
We weren’t

EARL
It was like you were carrying
potatoes

PIPPA
If Esme was a mom she’s be like be
like one of those girls who has a
tiny dog she just carries around in
her purse

CHRIS
If Esme was a Mom her kid would be
in foster care

TIM
Esme let’s face it if you were a
Mom you’d probably kill yourself

EARL
I wouldn’t leave her alone with my
kids

Everyone laughing Esme is really upset trying not to look
upset

There is a KNOCK at the door
A SECRETARY comes in the room

SECRETARY
Sorry Mr Wessex he says he needs
to see Esme now

Isho is behind the secretary He comes in the room holding
Judd awkwardly

Esme walks up to Isho takes Judd from him

ISHO
He made a weird sound He made a
weird sound and it sounded like an
obese black lady saying “UH HUH”

EARL
Esme Why is this guy here with
your nephew

ISHO
Sorry for barging in I was just
watching Esme’s nephew for a minute
and freaked out Like whoa this
mini guy just talked like a black
woman

TIM
Hey aren’t you the pushup guy from
the mall and downtown

ISHO
Yeah

TIM
Youre like the strongest guy who
ever lived You can do four
thousand push-ups in a row

ISHO
Four thousand only when I listen to
music otherwise I get bored by one
thousand

CHRIS
Do four thousand pushups right now
and I’1l give you 200 dollars

Isho shrugs puts in his ear buds and he starts doing push-
ups

PIPPA
Look at Esme holding that baby
Someone take another photo It’s
too funny

Everyone laughs at Esme holding Judd She looks uncomfortable
at the laughter

CHRIS
TOTAL sack of potatoes

ESME
(accidentally screams)
THIS IS MY BABY

Everyone is stunned Quiet Isho still does the push-ups with
his ear buds in music playing

ESME (CONTD)
This is my baby and I’ve been
hiding him and the pregnancy
forever so I could do this blog for
vodka money I am a terrible person
but I’m a good Mom I’ve lost so
many jobs for pranking at work

(MORE)

ESME (CONTD)
and pretending to be a Party Girl-
getting paid to be party girl for
the last 10 months- while Ive been
pregnant and sick and having my
vagina torn open by a baby then
being up all night with a baby
instead of partying is probably the
best prank I’ve ever pulled so I’m
not surprised I’m losing this job
too I’m sorry I let you down Earl
And Chris

Esme gives Chris the finger

ESME (CONTD)
THIS IS WHAT A MOM LOOKS LIKE

Esme pulls Isho’s ear buds out as he does push-ups
ESME (CONT’D)
(whispers)
Cmon let’s go You don’t want
that asshole’s money

EXT STREET OUTSIDE OFFICE BUILDING - FEW MINUTES LATER 100

TORI (CONTD)

SETH

TORI
There are warning signs like if
your spouse is being weird with
their cell phone calls and texts or
if they’re trying to get out of
things It’s important to know
what’s going on Seth especially
when your significant other has a
job that keeps them at a distance
from you

jail for murdering Tori tonight

ADRIANNA
Rise above Esme You can do it It

of the party I want to have a
nice Ukrainian baby party and then

That’s part of the Ukrainian lore

The door opens and Caroline sticks her head in she’s
covering her eyes
