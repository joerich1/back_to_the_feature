CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the WEB spanning the open mouth of a
long-dead CADAVER The body little more than a dry husk hangs
from an improvised gallows A HAND-LETTERED SIGN is nailed into
the post “REBEL”

EXT DESERT - DUSK

Rows of crude GALLOWS flank a CANYON Dangling from each
scaffold a burnt CORPSE

Silhouetted by the fiery red sky hundreds of HEADS of cattle
move past the human remains driven by a handful of wary COWBOYS

CAMERA closes on one drover EDMUNDO DANTES 19 His high
cheekbones full mouth and deep-set eyes suggest Indian blood He
stares at the corpses then spurs his horse

DANTES
reaches another COWBOY guiding a horse

Behind it tied to a travois is CALDERON the trailboss Hes
pure-blooded Mexican forty hard years etched on his leathery

face

Dantes dismounts and covers the old man trying to shield him
from the the wind CALDERON stares up at the swaying corpses

CALDERON
Rebels Never seen this many

DANTES
Don’t talk You need to rest

CALDERON
Justice the Emperor’s justice Some of
them they were very young

DANGLARS
They were nothing but thieves

The voice belongs to ETIENNE DANGLARS a wiry and bespectacled
Frenchman The paymaster of the cattle drive

- DANTES
Mexican soldiers Monsieur Danglars

He points fluttering on one cadaver a charred scrap of the
Mexican flag

DANGLARS
This country should be grateful to have
an Emperor to guide it to civilize it

Dantes mounts and moves away Danglars catches up with him The
cattle are being herded into a canyon over a narrow road

DANGLARS (cont’d)
Youre taking us through the canyon

DANTES
Yes Weather’s moving in

DANGLARS
Two days late already Dantes and you
say we should stop

DANTES
You saw the trailboss Well layover in
the caves until dawn Let him rest

He trots his horse through the herd leaving Danglars behind
THE CAVE — LATER

The cave is a natural wonder the size of two stadiums big
enough to accomodate the entire herd Outside a sandstorm rages
Inside the COWBOYS rest

Danglars is polishing his boots He looks over to a smaller
chamber where shadows are moving

CAVE CHAMBER

Firelight flickers on a SILVER CHAIN and an intricately carved
highly-polished HALF-MEDAL

CALDERON’ VOICE
A man will come

The medallion dangles from CALDERONS hand

CALDERON (contd)
If he has the matching half

Dantes kneels next to the feverish man whose shirt is soaked
with sweat His head rests on a saddle

CALDERON
you give him this

He produces the sealed ORDNANCE BOX and thrusts it into Dantes“
hands A NOISE makes Edmundo turn Danglars is there He carries
gome wet rags and a jug of water

DANGLARS
I thought that as paymaster I should bear
witness to any —

DANTES
(takes the water)
Leave us alone Now -

Danglars politely retreats but his eyes stay on the ordnance

Morales smiles at Lee and then turns to the men

MORALES
Listen up You all know how I felt about
Joaquin Calderén There wasn‘t a better
cowhand in all of Mexico God he loved

The men all listen attentively their heads uncovered as a sign
of respect Dantes and Lee stand to one side

Take a look at him

Danglars gets to his feet But Morales turns towards DANTES The
young man is amazed

DANTES

the hand and awkwardly shakes it The men burst into spontaneous
YELLS and APPLAUSE All except

Danglars who regards the young man with hatred
INT STABLE — STORAGE AREA

Danglars sorts through the tack until he finds Dantes‘ trailbag
He pulls out the ordnance box Its sealed with wax Using a

Danglars closes the ordnance box

documents The soldiers stand by his side chatting in French

Dantes notices a slight gap in some curtains in the back The gap
quickly closes

BEHIND THE CURTAIN

I want his back to me

GERARDO VILLAFUERTE — a man in his mid-thirties tall gaunt
dressed in black His rigid pale face looks like marble in
contrast with to jet-black widow-peaked hair and small darting
eyes He addresses a FRENCH OFFICER (Their dialog is in French

subtitled)

The French officer parts the curtains and gestures to the TWO
SOLDIERS They rotate Dantes’ chair

On foot Dantes leads his horse along a narrow trail at the edge

he saves himself by grabbing a protruding root Slowly
methodically he keeps moving up

Nothing but stone ruins Dantes finds a staircase and descends
into darkness

Using a small oil lamp Dantes searches the Stygian intestines of

A scene of desolation Wine barrels lie broken on the ground
Guano mounds rise up in the lamplight Waist-thick roots
penetrate from above Dantes is weary frustrated

DANTES
the hand of God

His light plays over bat-infested ceilings sending leathery
wings brushing past his face

A rope and bucket hang from a pulley overhead Why There’s no
well here He lowers the bucket THUNK It hits the floor The

stones look different here He circles the spot shifting the oil
lamp from side to side The moving shadow reveals a design

SPLASH Dantes plummets into an eerie ice-cold lake Above a

Dantes drags himself onto an embankment Suddenly he gropes with

He finds the oil lamp strikes a match As the flame grows
everything is bathed in an other-worldly gold light Shivering
he gawks at the walls They sparkle with gold tankards relics

Near the entry an old WHITE-HAIRED MAN is seated in a pathtub
and two INDIANS pour water over him

One of the Indians drapes a serape over Morales’ shoulders The
old man nods

sees a man sitting on a pew His father He rushes to him

twice until it’s wet with his blood Then his voice comes

hissing through clenched teeth

Morales obeys Dantes presses his face against the stone his
hands tightening their already white-knuckled grip

DANTES
Father Here is your son He did die In
prison of sorrow and a broken heart

Out of the cracked soil at the base of the tomb a group of black
SCORPIONS emerges Dantes takes one on his dead right hand

DANTES (contd)
But I have taken his place And I have
no tears

The scorpion STINGS Dantes Barely flinching he calmly transfers
the creature onto his other hand and crushes it

Embarrassed she ducks and loses her grip There’s a soft THUD
as she lands Behind him A MAN arrives His voice is deep
melliflous familiar

VOICE
Gentlemen my apologies for being 30
late Ive been in court all day

(to all explaining)
Were clearing the dockets of a mountain
of old cases Corruption will be
eradicated
(beat)

The courts of Monterrey will have a new
judge soon A good judge

Montecristo slowly turns to face the MAN at Mondego’s side
VILLAFUERTE visibly older but still chilling in his sober
almost clerical mien

MONTECRISTO
Forgive my ignorance sir but what
may I ask makes a good judge

VILLAFUERTE
(eyeing the stranger)
A dedication to the law of course

MONTECRISTO
The law at any cost Most commendable

But what about justice

VILLAFUERTE
Theyre one and the same

The other men murmur in approval Villafuerte turns to them
ready to resume conversation when —

MONTECRISTO
That is only your opinion

Pardon

MONTECRISTO

FERNANDO

May I introduce you to our honored guest
the Count of Montecristo

VILLAFUERTE
Gerardo Villafuerte Attorney General for
the state of Nuevo Leon

Montecristo bows lightly The guests move closer attracted by the
repartée

VILLAFUERTE
Perhaps sir you should educate us as
C to the difference between law and
7 justice

UO) Some faint chuckles from the men around them
MONTECRISTO

(beat)

When you speak of the law you mean the
law of men Where everything is relative
Man-made laws are often merely
documented lies Lies to serve the most
skillful but not the innocent Justice —
like the truth - is natural and
transcendent The law can destroy the
innocent justice cannot

something to fear

Fernando and Ana watch from the outer circle of darkness both
equally jealous

ripples through the murmuring crowd whose candle will go out
But Mercedes makes a deep curtsy Holds out her candle

(to his aides)
Let him go Let him go

He then stares straight into Montecristos eyes

VILLAFUERTE (cont d)
Is this not enough for you7

Abruptly villafuerts puts the Derringer under his own chin and
FIRES

The horror-stricken aide and the other soldiers back out of
Montecristos path as he walks away

cuT TO
EXT MORALES RANCH - DUSK

Montecristo quietly rides his horse toward the stables

Standing fifty yards away a CLOAKED FIGURE awaits him MONDEGO
a six-gun in each hand At Montecristos approach Mondego
withdraws disappearing around a corer x

Smiling Montecristo clicks his GUN HAND into place and follows
He takes out 2 cigar and lights it Spurs his horse toward

THE BULLFIGHT RING

Entering the arena Montecristo finds himself alone As he
dismounts the horse balks trying to back up Then Montecristo
sees a metallic glint

Moving in the shadows all around him a dozen gunmen
MONTECRISTO
Mondego you prefer an ambush to a
duel

Montecristo whips the horse as it leaps ahead the shooting
starts

GUNFIGHT
Montecristo marches forward the GUN HAND doing its infernal
work Muzzle flashes rhythmic mechanical relentless Men die

as he stalks Fernando who cowers pehind a water trough

Bullets begin to find Montecristo One grazes his face Another
grazes his shoulder He stumbles
LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS 119

f
two of FERNANDO‘S men WHOOP and close in for the kill

Suddenly an explosion1 SAGRARIO pops out from pehind a bull
parrier lighting a second stick of dynamite Throwing it

He then blasts the survivors with a SHOTGUN ‘He grins at
Montecristo

SAGRARIO
Couldnt let you die alone Sailor man

More gunmen appear

Montecristo empties his gun clicks in more bullets FIRES
SAGRARIO reloads and joins in

Bullets fly ripping apart walls flesh and bone

Montecristo and Sagrario walk in circles at the center of the
arena covering each other while firing in almost balletic

synchronicity

BULLFIGHT ARENA CORRIDOR

The long dark corridor is half-filled with sand Everywhere
moaning men are bleeding crawling Montecristo roams from corpse
to corpse looking for F

A man appears at the end of the corridor FERNANDO

Montecristo turns to face him Finally a duel amidst a sea of
death

FERNANDO
That machine on your hand sir -
Prove that you’re not a coward Take it
off

Montecristo considers this Decides Slides off his gold harness
almost ritually exposing his dead colorless fingers

The two men stare at each other hands at their sides A BLUR

BAM BAM They each fire Montecristo’s shirt floods with fresh
blood He lurches backwards

Then Fernando crumples over face first into a pool of his own
blood

Montecristo staggers forward With his beot he rolls the General
over

A TAT IO
LEFT HAND OP DARKNESS 120

FERNANDO -—
(fading)
Who — are you What are you

Montecristo brings his face close to his victim pressing the
muzzle of his gun against the dying man’s forehead

MONTECRISTO
(whisper)
I am the past Fernando
Fernando‘’s eyes grow large with the pain of revelation

FERNANDO
Dantes

Eyelock A full second goes by Montecristo fires
BULLFIGHTING RING

Montecristo steps out from the corridor to greet Sagrario who
reacts to the blood covering his friend

Montecristo smiles reassuringly
Suddenly A SERIES OF SHOTS blast down from a balcony

SAGRARIO is hit square in the chest and as he falls two more
shots thud into his back Hie GLASS BYE bounces out like a
marble Hes dead

Montecristo shoots at the SNIPER then takes cover inside the

BALCONY STAIRWELL

Fighting off the pain Montecristo slaps another clip into his
gun and looks up The sniper is directly above He slowly hauls
himself up the stairs

THE BALCONY

Roof gone wind whistling through A body lies shivering in the
furthermost corner half-hidden by fallen beams young Ana lying
on the floor dressed once again in a boy’s garments Montecristo
lunges toward her rips her shirt A bullet hole stains her naked

flesh

ANA
(smiling at Montecristo)
you said don’t aim don’t think
about it But I couldn’t —
LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS 121

MONTECRISTO
pon’t talk The bullet went right through
you You will live I‘ll see to it

She is losing consciousness He fumbles for the ‘vial of crimson
fluid He locates it Hanging on his chest

MONTECRISTO
Three drops Seven seconds

Mercedes appears at the top of the stairs

MERCEDES
pont touch her

Montecristo presses his hand to Ana‘s chest Finds the dying
heartbeat Th-UMP TH — It stops

MONTECRISTO
God One two three f- -
Mercedes holds Mondego’s gun in her hand She shoots Montecristo
in the back

MERCEDES (contd)
you destroyed everything

Montecristo lifts his head looks at the vial The last fluid
seeps out from the shattered glass

MONTECRISTO
Six seven

Oniy a few drops left He moves to Anas body BAM his body
shudders at the impact of another bullet He uses both hands to
steady the broken vial a drop gathers at the tip

MERCEDES
Could you not spare your daughter

The liquid slowly falls into Anas mouth A second drop swells
and falls

With his last ounce of strength Montecristo waits for the third
drop which seems to be gathering in slow motion

Finally trembling it falls in

MONTECRISTO
she will live
He lets go and slumps to the floor Each exhalation forms a small
cloud of dust

C

LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS 122

Mercedes watches amazed as color and life shudder back into ‘the
girls body

MONTECRISTO (contd)
Dont let me go alone

Mercedes takes his shattered hand in hers Growing weak
Montecristo clings to her

MONTECRISTO (cont ‘d)
This time I wont be coming back you
know that dont you

He rolls onto his back seeking some kind of release Through the
roof the first stars appear His breath comes in short gasps

MONTECRISTO (contd)
Stars My name Say my name

Montecristo looks at her tears flowing freely now

MERCEDES
Edmundo

Montecristo smiles beatifically Mercedes’ mournful face shows a
trace of the nineteen year old she once was As she gazes down

she holds the young DANTES

DANTES
Edmundo Dantes That is my name And
my name is all I have

Ana moves close to them As she touches her father kneeling
beside him Bathed in a golden halo of redemption Montecristo

dies
