INT KITCHEN - DAY

Rain A despondent WOMAN holds the receiver of a rotary
phone DIAL TONE underscores her fixed eyes

The Seattle Times lays before her A generic COMPOSITE
SKETCH OF A MAN on the front page Could be anyone Your
neighbor Your brother

The phone’s off-hook alert pulls her back to reality

She considers her daughter -- playing in the other room --
then resets the hookswitch and dials

EXTREMELY WICKED SHOCKINGLY EVIL AND VILE

EXT MAIN STREET - DAY

from a passing Camaro as we follow a YORKSHIRE TERRIER
STOCKINGED LEGS swollen from peripheral edema and a POOPER
SCOOPER under a Star Wars marquee past tourists in bell
bottoms sundresses flowers peace signs flags free-
spirited hippy culture Saturated ‘70s pastels everywhere

SUPER Aspen CO Summer 1977

TED (VO)
Dear Liz This will be my last
letter and if anyone deserves to
hear it as it was it’s you After
I clear my name which will
undoubtedly require a modicum of
legal wrangling I intend to get my
hands on whoever’s responsible for
these unconscionable crimes to
ensure they never do it again

The terrier veers off onto the lawn of the Pitkin County
Courthouse to poop As the turds drop

-a man jumps out of a second story window in the
background twisting his ankle upon landing

FREEZE FRAME ON HIS FACE
looking straight at us 31 handsome with short-cropped
wavy brown hair and clear blue eyes His ear to ear grin is
as goofy as it is charming and has undoubtedly manipulated
many along the way This is TED

TED (VO)
I admit I am in a little trouble
but it’s all going to work out If
anything goes wrong you’1ll be
reading about me in the papers

RESUMING -- the peripherally edemic woman gasps as Ted
continues straight on up to her without missing a beat

Her fright becomes flattery as he takes the pooper scooper
and scoops the poop pets her dog then flashes his million
dollar smile
TED
Lovely hair ma’am You have a
fine day now
Ted briskly limps away leaving her flushed and tongue-tied
TED (VO)
It all started the summer after my
first year of law school

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

A Volkswagen Bug sputters by dark houses in the pre-dawn
hour All the Aspen color has been replaced by shadows

SUPER Utah Two Years Earlier
INT VOLKSWAGEN BUG - CONTINUOUS

Ted’s hunched over the wheel driving the quiet dark street
His hair is longer shaggier

In his rearview he notices another car tailing him which he
can only make as a black silhouette

Ted gives it a little gas but the other car keeps pace

Suddenly the high beams flip on He squints from the
reflection in his rearview Scared now Ted punches it

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

The Volkswagen Bug accelerates The pursuing car keeps pace
Ted burns through a stop sign

Only then do we realize that the pursuing car is a cop

INT VOLKSWAGEN BUG - CONTINUOUS

Red and blue lights play over Ted’s face He curses and
steers off the road

EXT GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

Ted cuts the engine and gets out He strolls to the rear of
his car as the cop pulls in behind Ted shrugs flashes that
million dollar smile -- now becoming familiar to us

TED
(sheepishly)
I guess I’m lost

The cop is BOB HAYWARD a no-nonsense highway patrol veteran
on the tail end of his shift Smiles don’t work on him

OFFICER HAYWARD
You ran two stop signs

TED
I do apologize officer but I
couldn’t make your car with the
headlights in my eyes and well I
guess I got spooked

OFFICER HAYWARD
Can I see your license and
registration

TED
Absolutely

Ted produces his ID Hayward studies it

OFFICER HAYWARD
What are you doing all the way out
here at this time of morning

TED
I caught a late movie over at the
Redwood drive-in but I obviously
missed the interstate on my way
home These subdivisions man

Hayward plays his flashlight over Ted’s car

OFFICER HAYWARD
What’d you see

TED
The Towering Inferno
Hayward then trains the flashlight back on Ted

SMASH TO
HANDCUFFS snapped around Ted’s wrists
Hayward shuts Ted in the back of a squad car

Two other squad cars have since arrived with a cluster of
officers now swarming Ted’s car with flashlights

TED (VO)
And hence began a domino effect of
compounding lunacy
They remove a BLACK CANVAS DUFFLE BAG
INT SQUAD CAR - NIGHT
In transit Ted sits cuffed in the back behind the cage

They drive past the Redwood drive-in where we notice it’s
playing Chinatown not The Towering Inferno

INT POLICE STATION BULLPEN - NIGHT
Hayward removes items from Ted’s evidence-tagged duffle bag
TED
It’s just junk I picked up around
the house I swear
Garbage bags rope flashlight gloves
TED (VO)
But the unfortunate conclusion one
might draw from seeing such items
side by side in the back of a car
on a dark night is as
understandable as it is humorous
Ski mask crowbar hacksaw

CUT TO

“POSSESSION OF BURGLARY TOOLS” reads the arrest report

Hayward fingerprints Ted who’s shaking his head laughing at
the absurdity

TED (VO)
But what happened next was no
laughing matter
INT INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
Ted sits across from Officer Hayward They both look tired

OFFICER HAYWARD
Have you ever been to the town of
Murray

TED
Sure

OFFICER HAYWARD
What about the Fashion Place
Shopping Mall

TED
Officer I’m a law student at the
University I’ve been all over the
greater Salt Lake area so what are
you trying to make of it

Hayward writes something down

TED
Officer do I need a lawyer

Hayward continues writing offering little explanation
INT LINE UP ROOM

Ted and seven doppelgangers file into a lineup facing their
own reflections in a two-way mirror

VOICE ON INTERCOM (0S)
Gentleman number seven please step
forward and read the card

Ted hesitates then steps forward He looks at the index
card in his clutch

TED
(shakily)
“Im a police officer your car has
been broken into Would you come
to the station with me”

VOICE ON INTERCOM (0S)
Turn left

Ted turns profile and swallows hard He remains in the
forefront for what seems like eternity
INT PHOTO ROOM
Ted turns for a mug shot eyes ringed with shock

criminal assault

INT DISTRICT COURT - ARRAIGNMENT HEARING - DAY

Ted stands flanked by his lawyer (we’1ll meet him soon) and
court deputies The young JUDGE STEW HANSON presides

JUDGE HANSON
How do you plead

Ted’s face drains of color His mouth has turned to cotton

TED
Not guilty of course

JUDGE HANSON
Trial is set for the twenty third
of February You shall remain in
the custody of the Salt Lake County
Sheriffs Department Bail is set
at one hundred thousand dollars

The gavel-pound ripples through Ted
INT INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

Teds lawyer JOHN OCONNELL enters in his usual cowboy hat
and boots He’s tall bearded with overgrown black hair

TED
John what the hell is going on

JOHN O’CONNELL
You were identified in a police
lineup by a woman who claims you
attempted to abduct her

TED
That’s preposterous I have no
idea who she is

JOHN O’CONNELL
Do you remember where you were on
the night of November 8th 1974
TED
That’s nearly a year ago

JOHN O’CONNELL
An alibi would be the best first
step

TED
If I can’t remember where I was on
a random night one year ago it’s
because my memory does not improve
with time It’s safe to say what I
was not doing however I was not
having heart surgery nor was I
taking ballet lessons nor was I in
Mexico nor was I abducting a
complete stranger

(sympathetically)

My heart goes out to her because
that is a truly awful thing for
anyone to have gone through but
she’s obviously mistaking me for
someone else

JOHN O’CONNELL
I know it looks dire but there’s
no physical evidence and eye
witness testimony is precarious at
best

TED
Why is this happening

JOHN O’CONNELL
You remember anything about some
girls disappearing last year in
Seattle

TED
(searching)
Yeah as a matter of fact I
remember a police sketch in the
paper and my friends all teased me
about a resemblance No one was
serious

JOHN O’CONNELL
Someone must have been because your
name landed on a list
TED
John I have a girlfriend who has
a young daughter both of whom I
love dearly I would never hurt a
woman

JOHN O’CONNELL
There are twelve hundred names on
that list and last I checked brown
hair and blue eyes are hardly
grounds for conviction It’s an
open and shut case as far as I’m
concerned Let me do what I do
best and in the end it’1ll be
nothing more than a funny story you
tell at cocktail parties

TED
I just want to go home

JOHN O’CONNELL
How does tomorrow sound

TED
The judge set bail at a hundred
grand

JOHN O’CONNELL
An obnoxious number for a boyscout
with no prior record I knocked it
down to fifteen You’re posting

tomorrow

TED
I don’t have fifteen thousand
dollars

JOHN O’CONNELL
Your pals in the Washington State
governors office passed a hat
around Did you think the top
defense attorney in Utah works pro
bono

Ted smiles Finally good news
INT JAIL CELL - DAY
Officer Hayward unlocks Ted’s cell
TED
I guess this is goodbye Someday

Bob you and I are going to laugh
about this over a beer
OFFICER HAYWARD
You really have no idea of the shit
coming down the pike do you

Ted grins warmly and extends his hand
TED

I look forward to seeing you at the

trial Bob

POURING RAIN A DOORBELL RINGS (PRE-LAP)
INT FOYER - LIZ’S HOUSE - DAY
8 year old REBECCA opens the door revealing Ted wearing a
goofy smile in the rain holding a newspaper over his head as
a makeshift umbrella
SUPER Seattle WA

REBECCA
Ted

TED
Come here you little booger
Youre getting so big

REBECCA
I drew you a picture

She gives him a crayon drawing

LIZ (0S)
(flat)
It’s a basking shark

Ted notices LIZ -- the woman from the opening scene -- a
tired 31 with homely bland looks but the way he looks at
her she’s an angel An obvious history here

TED
It’s lovely

LIZ
Rebecca go play in your room
Mommy needs to talk to Ted alone

REBECCA
But I want to play

TED
Go on booger Then we can all go
out for hamburgers and catch up

REBECCA
Can Tracy come

TED
Of course she can Why don’t you
call her right now and tell her
well pick her up at six

Rebecca runs off leaving Ted and Liz alone

TED
I missed you so much

Suddenly she slaps him

TED
Jesus Liz What was that for

LIZ
When were you going to tell me

TED
Tell you what

She cocks her hand back again

TED
Okay wait It’s not what you
think I got pulled over for
running a stop sign next thing I
know I’m in jail I’m as
dumbfounded as you

Liz picks up the rain-soaked newspaper Ted was using as an
umbrella and shows him the front page His mug shot next to
the composite sketch we saw A minor resemblance at best

LIZ
How many stop signs did you run

TED
Why is the Seattle Times running a
story from Utah

LIZ
What’s going on Ted

TED
You don’t actually believe this
garbage do you

(MORE)
TED (CONTD)
For chrissakes Liz I don’t know
if I should be offended or rolling
on the floor laughing

LIZ
It’s in the papers

TED
That must make it true then In
seven years have I ever laid a
hand on you

LIZ
That’s not the point

TED
When we went shopping for ski racks
and that lady got her purse
snatched what did I do What did
I do Liz

LIZ
You ran him down

TED
Is that the behavior of a man
(re newspaper)
who does this

Liz breaks down crying We’1ll come to know her as an
emotionally fragile codependent woman

TED
This is precisely why I didn’t tell
you I didn’t want you to freak
out And honestly I was
embarrassed

LIZ
So it’s not true

TED
(softening)
Come here stupid

Ted pulls her into a hug

LIZ
Do you have a lawyer

TED
One of the best in Utah and he says
it’s a slam dunk case Besides I
practically am a lawyer

LIZ
You love me right

TED
Baby I’m going to marry you

A smile spreads across her face She needed to hear this

TED
Once I finish law school and move
back we’ll get a place on the
Sound with a Mercedes and a dog
just like we talked about It’s
going to be a fairy tale

(smiles)

Don’t worry This is all one big
misunderstanding I’ve got it all
under control

Ted kisses her As he strokes her head in his chest he
notices a DARK BLUE SEDAN parked across the street

EXT TRACYS HOUSE - NIGHT

The rain has let up Rebecca rides on Ted’s shoulders Liz
interlocks her arm in Ted’s They look like a family now
Liz rings the doorbell

TED
What are you going to get on your
hamburger

REBECCA
Cheese

TED
Ketchup

REBECCA
Yep

TED
Pickles

REBECCA
Yep

TED

What about snails

REBECCA
Eww

TED

I’m going to get snails
REBECCA

That’s gross
TED

How can you know if you never

tried

The front door opens slightly Tracy’s mom NORA leans out
concerned parent written all over her face

LIZ
Hi Nora
(then)
You remember Ted

Nora forces a polite close-lipped smile

TED
Is Tracy all set We’re going to
fill our tummies with cheeseburgers
and root beer floats

NORA
Tracys sick in bed She can’t go
Stomach bug

Unbeknownst to Nora Tracy has snuck up behind and is peeking
out the door just staring at Ted Nora realizes she’s
caught in a lie

NORA
Sorry Liz

Nora sends a suspect glance Ted’s way then closes the door
and locks it The three of them look baffled

EXT HAMBURGER STAND - NIGHT

They eat cheeseburgers and fries at the counter Rebecca
colors with crayons on butcher paper Ted looks glum

TED
She thinks I’m a goddamn monster
LIZ
No she doesn’t She just doesn’t
know you
TED

What does she think I’m going to
do Attack her daughter

LIZ
It doesn’t matter what she thinks

TED
It matters to me

Ted pounds the table Obviously affected

TED
(leans in)
What happened in Utah wasn’t dumb
luck Liz The police already had
my name Someone gave it to them

All the color drains from Liz’s face

TED
The traffic stop sure that was
the wrong place wrong time but
the way it escalated I think
I’m being set up

PUSH IN on Liz as she considers her words

LIZ
(delicately)
Do you have any idea who

TED
I’m sure I made a few enemies the
year I spent on the Rockefeller
campaign but that was politics
This is personal It’s awful Liz
I feel I can’t trust anyone
Thankfully I have you

Stung by guilt she turns away to hide her tears

REBECCA (0S)
Done

Ted turns his attention to Rebecca’s drawing

REBECCA
It’s a thresher shark

TED
Why is his tail so long

REBECCA
Some thresher sharks have a tail as
long as their whole body

Ted grins at her innocence He notices Liz wiping her eyes

TED
Hey everything’s going to be
alright Okay

Liz forces a smile even though she fears otherwise As Ted
comforts her he spots the same dark blue sedan in the lot

Over the din of a cocktail reception

ROSS DAVIS (PRE-LAP)
This man single-handedly got Dan
Evans re-elected Governor of
Washington

INT HOTEL BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT
A Republican fundraiser full of glad-handing and ass-kissing
ROSS DAVIS Chairman of the Washington State Republican
Party slings his arm lovingly around Ted boasting to Liz
ROSS DAVIS

Hold on to this one honey He’1l

be governor himself one day
Liz smiles demurely Social functions aren’t her forte
A tall woman in thick tinted glasses taps Ted from behind
Pretty in a boyish way her name is CAROLE ANN BOONE and she

has a noticeable spark in her eye for Ted

CAROLE ANN
Welcome home stranger

Carole Ann inches Liz out of the way to hug Ted

CAROLE ANN
You’re still handsome as ever

TED
Carole Ann My goodness

Liz nervously clears her throat

TED
Oh this is my friend Liz
(to Liz)

Carole Ann and I worked together at
DES in Olympia years ago

CAROLE ANN
Department of Emergency Services

Liz forces a tight-lipped smile pulls Ted aside

LIZ
I’m going to go

TED
But we just got here

LIZ
You know how I hate these things

TED

These people raised money for my
defense I should show a little
gratitude

LIZ
Then do I’m tired

TED
How am I supposed to get to the
library later

LIZ

I’m sure Carole Ann would be over
the moon to take you It will give
you two an opportunity to catch up

TED
Liz don’t be like that

LIZ
Like what A friend

Liz gives him a cutting look and leaves Ted returns to his
circle with that reassuring sheepish grin Carole Ann meets
his eyes with sympathy

INT CAROLE ANN’S CAR - NIGHT
Carole Ann and Ted pull up to the UW law library laughing
TED
It was so good to see you Carole
Ann
CAROLE ANN
Everything’s going to be okay you
know
She puts her hand on his leg
CAROLE ANN

And if you need anything anything
at all

Ted blushes registers the roaring sexual tension

TED
Liz is my rock
(laughs)
I mean thank you

CAROLE ANN
Just remember we’re all behind you
one hundred percent

Ted nods appreciatively and gets out She watches him go
INT UW LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT

Ted enters Behind him students turn their heads in
recognition as he passes

INT LIZS HOUSE - NIGHT
Liz cries to her friend JOANNA in hushed tones

LIZ
I completely betrayed his trust

JOANNA
You can’t be so hard on yourself
You were just being safe

LIZ
I never wanted to make that phone
call This is all my fault How
can we ever have a normal
relationship now If he ever found
out he’d leave me

JOANNA
Take a deep breath What’s the
worst that could happen
Everything’s going to be fine

Liz sniffs back tears Thinks about it But her conscience
is her Achilles heel and she tears up again

LIZ
I’m so stupid

Joanna consoles her
INT BOOKSTACKS - NIGHT

Ted scans monolithic legal tomes until a voice interrupts

UNIVERSITY OFFICIAL (0S)
Sir Would you please gather your
belongings and follow me

Ted Confused
EXT UW LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT
Ted protests as he’s escorted out

TED
I am an alumnus of this school
preparing for a very important
trial This is a violation of my
rights

UNIVERSITY OFFICIAL
Look buddy you’re making all the
girls nervous Find another
library

He shuts the door on Ted Fuming mad Ted spots the same
dark blue sedan parked across the street and marches up to
it Bangs on the window

TED
Hey Who are you I know you’re
following me

The driver scrambles to start the car and drives away

TED
Leave me alone

Ted kicks at the cloud of burnt rubber Stress wearing on
him He starts walking

INT LIZS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ted tiptoes in trying not to wake Liz He undresses and
sneaks into bed Liz stirs and curls into his chest

TED
This thing is really starting to
get to me Liz I feel boxed
(no response)
Liz

Slow heavy breathing Ted sighs stares at the ceiling
Wide awake Tormented by what he’s shouldering all by
himself

TED
(beat)
Will you marry me

Liz looks at him Awake after all They start kissing
INT BARBER SHOP - DAY

Ted and John O’Connell get pre-trial haircuts The Utah
skyline out the window Ted’s noticeably tanner

JOHN O’CONNELL
Where’d you fly in from Barbados
I thought Seattle sun was an
oxymoron

TED
Liz and I hit the slopes yesterday
We’re engaged Once we win this
thing I might just make you my
best man

JOHN O’CONNELL
This case has gotten a lot of
press Ted An impartial jury is
going to be hard to find

TED
So we move to a bigger city

JOHN O’CONNELL
Salt Lake’s as big as they come

TED
Is there another option

JOHN O’CONNELL
Waive the jury completely

TED
And place everything in the hands
of a trial judge

JOHN O’CONNELL
Hanson’s a fair-minded jurist with
a reputation for controversial
acquittals There’s nothing we can
do about a biased jury so why not
go with one juror we know to be
intelligent

TED
That’s assuming he’s as smart as
his record suggests

JOHN O’CONNELL
I went to school with him
Besides the whole case hinges on
eyewitness testimony

TED
Which you said yourself is
notoriously unreliable

JOHN O’CONNELL
But it’s the most likely thing for
a jury to convict on

The barbers brush hair off them Ted checks the mirror
considering more than just his haircut

TED
You went to school with him

JOHN O’CONNELL
The lead prosecutor too He’ll
come to court in a red tie because
he knows his case is thin and uses
power colors to boost his
confidence

TED
(thinks it over)
One condition You shave that
caveman beard for my wedding
photos

JOHN O’CONNELL
Blow me

INT ROOM 310 - SALT LAKE CITY COURTHOUSE - DAY

Judge Hanson presides over a high-ceilinged red-carpeted
courtroom Every available seat filled except the jury box

Ted’s clean shaven in a light bluegray suit white shirt
and bow tie sitting with John O’Connell He finds Liz in
the gallery Sends her a wink and a smile

Liz riddled by nerves smiles thinly She sits with Ted’s
petite mother LOUISE looking concerned as any parent would

The state prosecutor DAVID YOCOM the same young age as
O’Connell and Hanson looks like a good Mormon boy He
delivers his opening statement

DAVID YOCOM
Your Honor November 8th 1974 may
have been just another rainy night
for most of Murray Utah but it
was a life-altering tornado of
horror for one woman in particular

He’s referring to CAROL DARONCH a soft-featured 19 year
old strawberry blonde sitting behind the prosecution Shed
be stunning on any other day But today she’s reliving the
pain of the night Yocom is recounting

O’Connell leans over to Ted whispers

JOHN O’CONNELL
Red tie

DAVID YOCOM
She was shopping for a birthday
gift at the Fashion Place Shopping
Mall when she was approached by a
Man posing as a police officer He
flashed a badge and asked her to
come with him because her car had
been burglarized As the daughter
of a police officer she felt
foolish to question his authority
and so followed him to the parking
lot where he led her to what he
claimed to be an unmarked police
vehicle The moment he coerced her
inside she smelled alcohol on his
breath and knew he wasn’t a cop
When he drove in the opposite
direction of the police department
she knew she was in trouble He
suddenly slapped a handcuff around
her wrist She struggled before he
could latch the other and fell
backward out of the car He
pursued her swinging for her head
with a crowbar until she twisted
free from his grasp and fled for
her life When she arrived at the
Murray Police Department the only
remnants of her ordeal were the
handcuffs dangling from her wrist
and the psychological scars that
she bears to this day and likely
all that will follow

The courtroom has suddenly dropped a few degrees

DAVID YOCOM
The state will request this court
in its powers as both judge and
jury to find this defendant guilty
as charged of aggravated kidnap

Yocom returns to his seat O’Connell rises

JOHN O’CONNELL
If this were a stage Mr Yocom
might well have won an award for
his expert raconteurial display
But if spectacle is what the
prosecution seeks let me be the
bearer of bad news This trial is
an awful lot of smoke but not much
fire We have a young lady who has
unquestionably gone through hell
and back but it will be my
obligation to reveal just how
unreliable and by turn immature
she is in her accusations The
evidence she provided is the most
obvious forced identification of
anything I have ever seen in my
legal career And while we’re
talking about victims consider the
ruin my client’s life has become in
the months preceding this trial
from press speculation rumors
and hearsay He has been
victimized by publicity before his
voice has even been heard It isa
damn tragedy

O’Connell sends a taunting wink Yocom’s way then returns to
his seat

DAVID YOCOM
Your Honor the prosecution calls
Carol DaRonch to the witness stand

Ted whispers to O’Connell

TED
He’s coming out swinging

JOHN O’CONNELL
He knows he’s only got one bat

INT ROOM 310 - SALT LAKE CITY COURTHOUSE - LATER

Carol DaRonch is on the witness stand in the middle of
Yocom’s patient questioning
CAROL DARONCH
-at that point I clawed at his
face and was able to get away

DAVID YOCOM
As best you recall Carol is the
man who approached you present in
court today

CAROL DARONCH
Yes

DAVID YOCOM
Where is he seated

She timidly looks toward Ted

DAVID YOCOM
May the record show the
identification of the defendant

JOHN O’CONNELL
It may

JUDGE HANSON
It will

DAVID YOCOM
No further questions Your Honor

Yocom returns to his seat but not before wrapping his
knuckles over O’Connell’s table

O’Connell smirks Out for blood he approaches DaRonch
diminishing her in his tall presence

JOHN O’CONNELL
It is your testimony now that you
did scratch this man is that
right

CAROL DARONCH
Because all my fingernails were
broken

JOHN O’CONNELL
Yet in the preliminary hearing Mr
Yocom asked “Do you recall ever
scratching him with those
fingernails” And you answered
“No” Do you have an explanation
for that

CAROL DARONCH

JOHN O’CONNELL
In fact the officers on November
8th asked if you remembered if you
hurt the man in any way and you
told them no then too didn’t you

Her voice becomes increasingly fragile

CAROL DARONCH
I don’t remember

JOHN O’CONNELL
You also said he was wearing a
mustache

CAROL DARONCH
Yes

JOHN O’CONNELL
But shortly after the incident you
said that he didn’t

CAROL DARONCH
Yes

JOHN O’CONNELL
Then sometime later you decided he
did again

CAROL DARONCH
Yes

JOHN O’CONNELL
When did you make that decision

CAROL DARONCH
Right after I decided that he
didn’t have one

DaRonch’s eyes well with tears

JOHN O’CONNELL
Ms DaRonch if you cannot
accurately remember whether you did
or did not scratch your abductor
nor whether he was or was not
wearing a mustache at the time of
the incident how are we to believe
your identification of him ten
months later is not also erroneous

DAVID YOCOM
Objection Your Honor

JOHN O’CONNELL
Ill rephrase Ms DaRonch had
the police shown you any pictures
of the defendant prior to your
identification of him at the
October 2nd lineup

CAROL DARONCH
Yes

JOHN O’CONNELL
You did in fact pick his mug shot
out of a pile

CAROL DARONCH
Yes

JOHN O’CONNELL
But when asked why you chose his
picture specifically you stated
“It looks something like him but I
really couldn’t say for sure” Is
this correct

CAROL DARONCH
Yes

JOHN O’CONNELL
So tell me Ms DaRonch If you
were unsure of your identification
then ten months after the
incident what makes you so sure of
it now nearly a year and a half
later

Mascara runs down her cheeks She’s at a complete loss

JOHN O’CONNELL
No further questions

Ted looks back at Liz Gives her a thumbs up
TIME CUT
Now Ted’s on the witness stand Yocom’s questioning
DAVID YOCOM

Do you remember the night of August
16th 1975
TED
(smiles)
Isn’t that why we’re all here

A few laughs in the courtroom Not even a grin from Yocom

DAVID YOCOM
You were arrested for fleeing an
officer

JOHN O’CONNELL
Objection Your Honor

DAVID YOCOM
You were arrested for evading an
officer

JOHN O’CONNELL
Objection

TED
How about rabbited

DAVID YOCOM
Fine Why did you “rabbit” from
Officer Hayward

TED
The truth

DAVID YOCOM
Only that which you swore to tell
in whole and nothing but

TED
(matter-of-factly)
I was smoking marijuana

O’Connell nearly leaps out of his chair

JOHN O’CONNELL
Objection Your Honor I’d like to
request a five minute conference
with my cli--

TED
John it’s okay I got it
(to Yocom)

I was smoking grass and had to air
out the car I’m only grateful the
officer didn’t notice me flick it
out the window or he’d have stuck
me with littering too and then I’d
really be up a creek

Chuckles in the court O’Connell’s about to faint

DAVID YOCOM
But you didn’t mention this detail
to your arresting officer or
apparently even your own attorney

TED
I was embarrassed

DAVID YOCOM
That may be sir but at the end of
the day a lie is a lie The arrest
report also states you lied about
having just seen a drive-in movie

TED
Have you ever smoked a joint Mr
Yocom

DAVID YOCOM
I don’t see how that’s relevant

TED
It makes you paranoid I panicked
and said the first thing that came
to mind I’m not proud of it but
it is the truth

DAVID YOCOM
The defendant lied to a police

and by his own admission was

say such revelations throw the
validity of his entire testimony

Now John let’s just relax here

Do you realize you just took a dump
on our entire defense And made a
complete imbecile of me

TED
People respect honesty John

JOHN O’CONNELL
Yocom and Hansen are probably
laughing their asses off right now

TED
Did you expect me to sit there like
a stuffed shirt while the state
distorted all the facts I won’t
be railroaded

JOHN O’CONNELL
Railroaded or outshined

TED
What’s that supposed to mean

JOHN O’CONNELL
Your grandstanding took precedence
over basic strategy and now it’s
all but done you in

TED
Who used this trial as an excuse to
play big dick with old college
rivals

JOHN O’CONNELL
This isn’t about me You survived
months of character assassination
only to give yourself the headshot

A melancholy falls over the room

It’s going to turn out just fine
I know it I just do

Liz stares at the floor her conscience weighing on her

EXT TED’S BACKYARD - DUSK

Liz lies in Ted’s lap plucking a dandelion Ted stares
absently at the Utah sunset

LIZ
What about the church on the north
side of Seattle The one with the
red door by the park

She tickles his nose with the dandelion bringing him back

TED
Hm What about it

LIZ
The wedding silly We could have
the reception in the park to make
it easy on everyone

TED
Maybe it isn’t the best time for
that right now

Liz suddenly stops plucking

TED
Don’t you think we should focus on
getting through the trial first
Then I have to finish law school
and I just don’t want to rush into
anything I care too much about us
to do that You understand right

Ted watches the setting sun more pressing things on his
mind Liz rips the head of the dandelion off the stem

JUDGE HANSON
After an agonizing weekend
pondering the arguments presented
in this courtroom and by the power
vested in me as both judge and
jury I hereby find the defendant
guilty of aggravated kidnapping
beyond a reasonable doubt

Ted takes in a deep breath His mother’s sobs cut through
the room

Lizs blood runs cold Her worst fear now a reality She
did this

JUDGE HANSON
You will be remanded to the Utah
State Prison to await sentencing

TED

Your Honor my rights have been
trammeled by the very institutions
I count on for protection

(tearful)
Someday who knows when five or
ten or more years in the future
when the time comes when I’m free
I suggest you ask yourself where we
are what’s been accomplished was
the sacrifice of my life worth it
all Yes I will be a candidate
for rehabilitation But not for
what I have done for what the
system has done to me

What I want is better food in the

light in my cell that doesn’t
strain my eyes to the point of
myopic blindness so that I can
adequately prepare for a re-trial

DET MIKE FISHER
Do you think you have a shot at a
re-trial

TED
This girl who claims I kidnapped
her The police showed her my
picture not once but twice before
she picked me out of a lineup
DET MIKE FISHER
So of course you looked familiar to
her

TED
And they stand me next to seven
other slouches each a few years
older a few dozen pounds heavier
which begs the question--

DET MIKE FISHER
Was it really a fair lineup

Ted clicks and winks Exactly

really want to know is when you

The gallery is packed with even more people than the Salt
Lake City trial including reporters and photographers

Ted sits with his new public defenders the young JIM DUMAS

District attorney FRANK TUCKER presents his motion to
presiding JUDGE GEORGE H LOHR

DA FRANK TUCKER
Wed like to enter into record the
defendant’s most recent conviction
in the attempted abduction of a
young woman with a crowbar bearing
an unmistakable similarity in shape
to the skull fractures on Ms
Campbell

Ted’s public defender Chuck Leidner stands in objection

CHUCK LEIDNER
Your Honor the defense implores
the court recognize the state’s
baseless and desperate ploy to
conjoin nonexistent areas of
commonality between the two cases
Such evidence is little else than
hearsay thereby rendering it
irrelevant considering said case is
actively under appeal in the Utah
courts

JUDGE LOHR
Let the record also show the
current proceedings represent a
preliminary hearing and that all
matters including ones of hearsay
may be entered into the court’s
careful and timely account
Furthermore if the defense wishes
to motion to suppress the
particularities of the state’s
case the defense is welcome to
motion in kind at the appropriate
time via appropriate channels

As to the appellate status of the
hearsay case consider it noted

that you saw Caryn Campbell with a

didn’t do And I don’t like my
liberty taken away And I don’t
like being treated like an animal
And I don’t like people walking
around and ogling me like I’m some
sort of weirdo Because I’m not

speaking about it’s too broad and
I can’t get into it in any detail
but I’m satisfied with my blanket
statement that I’m innocent No
man is truly innocent We’ve all
transgressed in some way in our
lives and as I say I’ve been
impolite and are there things I
regret having done in my life
Nothing like the things I think
that you’re referring to

chance of dying in front of a

Sorry you came all this way

that you notify me when he contacts
you

LIZ

Is that it

DET MIKE FISHER
I wanted to give you this

as

Fisher hands her a large manila envelope

DET MIKE FISHER

It’s something we’ve long suspected
him of I thought you should see
firsthand just how serious this is

LIZ
Suspected So there isn’t even
hard proof

DET MIKE FISHER

Just look at it If you help us
you can prevent it from happening
again

Liz hesitates gives back the manila envelope

LIZ
Ted’s a good person Shame on you
for coming here

DET MIKE FISHER

Liz there are things you don’t
know that I can’t tell you right

only a matter of time before the
cards are on the table And when
they are they will rack you

Teds new public defenders PEGGY GOODE ED HARVEY and LYNNE THOMPSON sit on foldout chairs outside his
cell They look more like first year associates than criminal
attorneys Lead counsel is the “elder” MIKE MINERVA (40s)

MIKE MINERVA
Larry Simpson thinks we should
consider a plea negotiation He
thinks if we continue down the path
were on the pretrial hearings
might develop a great deal of
incriminating evidence against you
which could make it impossible to
later conclude a plea agreement
once the public is aware of it all

TED
The chief prosecutor thinks this
or you think this

MIKE MINERVA
If you enter a plea of guilty to
all pending murder charges the
state would recommend consecutive
life sentences in exchange

TED
This is a joke right

MIKE MINERVA
When you consider the evidence the
state has combined with the
pretrial publicity it seems highly
likely that the state can secure
convictions and because of the
nature of the offenses several
death sentences

TED

If you think there’s any chance in
hell I’11 plead guilty to any of
these charges you’re out of your
fucking mind

Minerva forces a close-lipped smile The defenders close
their briefcases and get up

Ted’s left alone the severity crushing down on him
INT VISITATION ROOM - NIGHT

Ted enters surprised to see his mother Louise waiting for

shackled He immediately goes to hug her

He notices his lead counsel Mike Minerva off to the side and
does the math

TED
What is this some kind of ambush

CAROLE ANN
Of course not Bunny We just
thought it best to discuss
everything together

TED
What is there to discuss

His mother’s voice cracks with heartache

LOUISE
I wouldn’t be able to live if I
lost you It would simply break my
heart and never be put back
together again

TED
(re Minerva)
Did he put you up to this

CAROLE ANN
Nobody put anyone up to anything

TED
I’m not pleading

CAROLE ANN
(to Minerva)
What does the evidence really say

TED
The evidence is all fabricated
They’re absolutely determined to
get convictions even if they know
they’1l be overturned later

Suddenly Louise slaps Ted

LOUISE
They are going to take your life
My first born My beautiful baby
A mother cannot outlive her son

TED
(horrified)
Mom Do you think I did these
things

LOUISE
All that matters now is what the
newspapers say and the newsmen have
manufactured a monster

Doom sinks into Ted Tormented faces stare back at him

CAROLE ANN
We’re all behind you Bunnykins
whatever you decide

Minerva gives Ted the plea document and a pen Ted takes
deep breath

TED
(to Minerva)
Can we make arrangements for me to
be transferred to Washington so
that I can be close to the people I
care about

ON CAROLE ANN -- subtly wounded by Ted’s request Is he
referring to Liz and Rebecca

MIKE MINERVA
There are no guarantees

a

Ted hesitates for an interminable beat Out of compassion
for his mother’s anguish he signs But he looks like he
just sold his soul

MIKE MINERVA
Now listen very carefully Ted
When we go to court the judge will
conduct a plea colloquy to insure
the voluntariness and factual basis
of the plea It is absolutely
essential that you make no
extraneous statements or
equivocation of any kind that would
hedge a future appeal This is a
firm condition of the prosecution
Do you understand

Ted nods paralyzed by doom Louise and Carole Ann hold him

We’ll get to know him better later

Your Honor my client has a matter
to present to the court

All eyes on Ted His heartbeat nearly audible Ted rises
from his chair holding the plea document He takes a sip of
water his hand shaking

TED

Your Honor

(beat then machine gun

precision)
Never in my legal career have I
encountered a man so brazen in
coercing his own client into
admitting guilt that it makes me
wonder if he has the stamina or
even basic mental acuity to roll up
his sleeves and do the work I
believe my lead counsel is not only
overwhelmed by this case but also
slave to a serious defeatist
posture In regard to the motion
filed by my attorneys I would like
to withdraw that motion

Ted tears the plea agreement in half and returns to his seat
The courtroom hangs in heavy silence

Minerva pinches the bridge of his nose sighs inwardly

MIKE MINERVA
Your Honor in light of the
personal attack on my competency
and character I fear vestiges of
resentment will prevent me from
being as zealous an advocate on my
client’s behalf as I should be and
May even result in subconscious
actions on my part that would be
damaging to him and his defense
Id like to withdraw as counsel

TED
The counselor’s first words I can
agree to

MIKE MINERVA
Fuck you

Muzzle yourselves counselors

Ted what the heck were you
thinking

We just lost the jury

ED HARVEY
Typically when you cross-examine
you want to have a strategy to your
line of questioning You impressed
needless violent imagery in their
minds

TED
And the autopsy photos didn’t For
godsakes Cowart referred to the
one as the hole-in-the-head
picture

LYNN THOMPSON
Were not saying there isn’t grisly
material in a murder trial But
the defendant dispassionately
walking us through the crime scene
is not an impression you want to
put forth

I was trying to show that the
officer left his own prints in the
rooms That he hadn’t proceeded
carefully Maybe I failed but at
least I tried I won’t sit idly by
while this machine grinds me up

don’t cross-examine the witnesses
anymore

litigated Ed

wonder if you might be shouldering

worried I might unload on you and I
don’t want to do that I have a

Your Honor there is no
justification for the treatment I
have been receiving This is a
game and I won’t be a party to it
I’m not staying in this kind of
Waterloo you understand There
comes a time when the only thing I
can do is passively resist There
comes a time when I have to say
“Whoa”

If you say “Whoa” I’m going to
have to use spurs

TED
(shaking his finger)
Since I have been in Dade County--

JUDGE COWART
Don’t shake your finger at me
young man

TED
I am strip searched after seeing my
attorney--

JUDGE COWART
Don’t shake your finger at me

Ted tilts his finger toward the defense table

JUDGE COWART
That’s fine You can shake it at
Mr Harvey

TED
He probably deserves it better than
you do I did not have any choice
in the selection of my attorneys
nor have I been asked at any time
my opinion about who should be
representing me

(MORE)
TED (CONTD)
There are problems of communication
between me and my attorneys which
have reduced my defense the
defense which is not sanctioned by
me nor one which I can say I agree
with They ignore my input
disregard my decisions and refuse
my further participation in cross-
examinations before the jury Now
this railroad train is running but
if I’m going to get off I’1ll get
off to demonstrate to this court it
is affecting me

JUDGE COWART

(aghast)
Sir I don’t know of any case I’ve
seen or experienced where an
individual has received the quality
and quantity of counsel you have
There have been five separate
counsel here representing you
It’s unheard of Who’s minding the
store for the public defender I
can’t tell you This court has
watched with a great deal of care
that before witnesses are
tendered you are questioned and
this record will show hundreds of
“just a moment pleases” where your
attorneys confer with you I’ve
never seen anything like it in the
history of any case I’ve tried in
twenty seven years at the bar

TED
I demand the reins of my own
defense

JUDGE COWART
You may have them sir but might I
also warn that any lawyer who
represents himself has a fool for a
client

TED
I’ve always taken that particular
axiom like someone who works on his
own car It all depends on how
much you want to do by yourself

Ed Harvey stands at the defense table

ED HARVEY

Your Honor this is as good a time
as any to raise the issue of my
client’s competency

(candidly)
The man’s life is at stake His
conduct has revealed the
debilitating effects of a mental
disorder by reflecting a total lack
of insight regarding the disorder
and its effects on him by
reflecting a wholly inadequate
ability to consult with lawyers
about the case

Surprisingly Danny McKeever at the prosecutions table
stands up in Ted’s defense

DANNY MCKEEVER
Your Honor the man is difficult to
work with He’s almost cunning in
the way he works against his
attorneys but he’s competent

Ted relishes in the debate Someone on his side and
complimentary at that

JUDGE COWART

I agree with Mr McKeever and
that’s the end of this matter

(to Ted)
Now this court is going to proceed
on schedule without your voluntary
interruptions As forbearing as
this court can be it can also be
that strong

TED
I’m willing to accept the
consequences of my actions Your
Honor and anything I do I’m aware
of what the court will do

JUDGE COWART
Then we’re together Bless your
heart and I just hope you stay
with us If you don’t we’1ll miss
you

their money to come see me

I heard a loud thump Then
footsteps running from the hallway
upstairs

LARRY SIMPSON
Was that normal for a Saturday night

NITA NEARY
No It scared me so I hid behind
the doorway leading into the foyer
The footsteps ran down the stairs
and suddenly a man ran right past
me and crouched at the door

LARRY SIMPSON
Did you see this man

NITA NEARY
He was wearing a navy blue Toboggan
pulled down over the top half of
his face I remember he had a
sharp nose

DR RICHARD SOUVIRON handsome 50s in a dapper vest-suit
and goatee directs a pointer over an oversized double-
panel color blowup of TEETH -- Ted’s teeth He’s the
state’s biggest gun and has a flair for the theatrical

DR SOUVIRON
(indicating on the photos)
These are laterals bicuspids

incisors

(to jury)
Each individual’s teeth have
particular characteristics that

make them unique -- alignment
irregularities chips size
sharpness

Souviron opens another double-panel DRAMATICALLY REVEALING a
color photo of a buttocks with four purple rows of bite marks

DR SOUVIRON
This is an enlarged photograph of
the victim Lisa Levy’s buttocks

The jury leans forward in their seats
DR SOUVIRON

(using the pointer)
You can see the double bite The
individual bit once then turned
sideways and bit a second time
The top teeth stayed in about the
same position but the lower teeth
biting harder left two rings

Souviron drapes a clear sheet over the bite mark photograph

that bears enlarged outlines of Ted’s teeth

DR SOUVIRON
They line up exactly

LARRY SIMPSON
Doctor based upon your analysis
and comparison of this particular
bite mark can you tell us within a
reasonable degree of dental
certainty whether or not the teeth
represented in that photograph are
those of the defendant

DR SOUVIRON
Yes sir

LARRY SIMPSON
And what is that opinion

DR SOUVIRON
They made the marks

A collective gasp erupts throughout the court

LARRY SIMPSON
No further questions

Cowart bangs the gavel to restore order as Simpson
triumphantly to his seat

He’s all yours counselor

You better take this one Ed It’s
not in my wheelhouse

ED HARVEY
You sure I can handle it

returns
TED
(heartfelt)
Ed I’m sorry

Ed Harvey sets his jaw buttons his jacket and gets up

ED HARVEY
Dr Souviron analyzing bite marks is
part art and part science isn’t it

DR SOUVIRON
I think that’s a fair statement

ED HARVEY
And that really depends upon the
experience and education of the
examiner

DR SOUVIRON
Yes

ED HARVEY
And your conclusions are really a
matter of opinion Is that
correct

DR SOUVIRON
That is correct

ED HARVEY
Youve got a given set of teeth or
models and a given area of skin a
thigh or a calf Is there any way
to test whether those teeth will
make the same marks over and over

DR SOUVIRON

(smiles)
Yes because I did an experiment
just like that I took models and
I went to the morgue and I pressed
the models into the buttocks area
on different individuals and
photographed them Yes they can
be standardized and yes they do
match

ED HARVEY
(feigning disbelief)
You said cadavers

DR SOUVIRON
I couldn’t find any live volunteers

ED HARVEY
As with any art form there must be
subjective variance

DR SOUVIRON
If there’s an area of
inconsistency out it goes But
the odds of finding an identical
set like the defendant’s -- with
the wear on the centrals the
chipped lateral incisor everything
identical -- would be astronomical

ED HARVEY
When you say “the odds” you are
speaking of some kind of
probability Is that right

DR SOUVIRON
A very high degree of probability
It becomes a practical impossibility

ED HARVEY
Is it fair to say that odontology
is a relatively new forensic
science

DR SOUVIRON
No I don’t think that’s fair at
all Historically you have a case
of Paul Revere doing identifications
You have testimony admitted to the
bar in Massachusetts in the late
1800s on identification and you can
find citations for bite mark cases
even in the legal justice system that
go back twenty five years So what’s
new

ED HARVEY

JOE ALOI
Yes They were sent to me by the
editor of the Tacoma News Tribune

TED
What was the purpose of enlarging
certain portions of the photographs
that you were attempting to obtain
in chronological order

JOE ALOI
I was concerned about this chip on
the inside tooth and if the
photographs in evidence showed this
particular tooth in good condition
at certain times and at other
times when Dr Souviron had taken
his samples from you if the tooth
was in a different condition

TED
And what do the photos reveal

LARRY SIMPSON
Objection

JUDGE COWART
Sustained

Ted bites his lip momentarily stuck Cowart coaches him
JUDGE COWART
You might ask him if he was able to
“accomplish” Try it that way and
see if I object

Ted subtly nods his thanks to Cowart

Did you accomplish what you set out
to do

various reasons was uncooperative

when did you incur the chip in your
tooth

TED
In the middle of March 1978

PEGGY GOODE
Two months after the Chi Omega
murders

I was eating dinner in my cell in
the Leon County Jail and I bit down
hard just like you bite down on a
rock or pebble and I pulled out a
white piece of tooth

Danny McKeever of the prosecution trades places with Peggy
Goode on cross-examination

records look like do you

themselves

Would you be surprised to know that
those teeth appear to be chipped
from the Utah dental records

TED
Yes I would

McKeever smiles confidently

Ted as defense attorney Peggy Goode whispers something to
him He nods and suppresses a smile He approaches the
witness Carole Ann

TED
Did you ever visit me in the
Garfield County Jail in late 1977

CAROLE ANN
Yes I did
And to the best of your memory did

TED

I have any kind of a chip in my
front tooth at that time

No you

CAROLE ANN
did not

They hold each other’s gaze for a beat before Ted returns to

his showmanship

TED

Your Honor I think you understand
what I’m getting at I’d like to
subpoena all newspapers to turn

over the

ir negatives of me because

if that chip did not occur until

March 19

78 two months after the

Chi Omega crimes and if the
state’s odontologists say that

space be

tween the two linear

abrasions could only have been made

by a too
between

th with a chip or a gap
the two central incisors

then there’s obviously something

wrong wi

th the observations made by

the state’s odontologists Our
contention all along Your Honor

is that
and twis

they have taken my teeth
ted them every which way

but loose to fit

Sir you

JUDGE COWART
May jump up and down and

hang from the chandelier but the
court will not dash for new

evidence

at your command

There are two ways for the police
to investigate a crime They can

suspect decide on the suspect and
decide to make the evidence fit the
suspect and work to make the
evidence fit only him

Now now mother We haven’t lost
a mother yet

CUT TO

During Larry Simpson’s closing remarks we PAN OVER the
victims in the gallery Kathy Kleiner Karen Chandler Nancy
Dowdy

LARRY SIMPSON
His mother can stand before you
and ask for mercy How nice it
would have been if Lisa Levy’s and
Margaret Bowman’s mothers could
have been there that morning of
January 15 1978 and asked for
mercy for them

CUT TO

Cowart reads the verdict

JUDGE COWART
It is this court’s reasoned
judgment that you be adjudicated
guilty of murder in the first
degree that the killings were
indeed atrocious and cruel in that
they were extremely wicked
shockingly evil vile and with
utter indifference to human life
and that you’ll be put to death by
a current of electricity and such
current of electricity shall
continue to pass through your body
until you are dead

Ted stands before Judge Cowart shaky tearful like a son
facing his father

TED
I’m not asking for mercy I find
it somewhat absurd to ask for mercy
for something I did not do I’m
not the one responsible for the
acts in the Chi Omega house
Although the verdict found in part
that those crimes had been
committed it erred in finding who
committed them

(MORE )

TED (CONTD)
As a consequence I cannot accept
the sentence even though one will
be imposed because it is not a
sentence of me it is a sentence of
someone else who is not standing
here today So I will be tortured
for and receive the pain for that
act but I will not share the
burden or the guilt The court is
like a hydra right now It’s been
asked to dispense no mercy as the
maniac at the Chi Omega house
dispensed no mercy and it’s asked
to render the wisdom of a god like
some incredible Greek tragedy that
portrays the three faces of man

JUDGE COWART
The court is going to sentence the
person found guilty of the offense
Your name sir was on the verdict
(softly)
Take care of yourself young man

TED
Thank you

JUDGE COWART
I say that to you sincerely Take
care of yourself It’s a tragedy
for this court to see such a total
waste of humanity that I’ve
experienced in this courtroom
Youre a bright young man Youd
have made a good lawyer and I’da
loved to have you practice in front
of me But you went another way
partner Take care of yourself I
don’t have any animosity toward
you I want you to know that

TED
Thank you

JUDGE COWART
Take care of yourself

TED
Thank you

Cowart anti-climactically taps the gavel Ted looks into the
gallery in time to see Carole Ann exiting without looking
back

As Ted’s handcuffed and led out his narration resumes

TED (VO)
The system as it stands now is
not really geared to getting at the
truth so much as it gets at
portions of the truth It gets at
approximations of the truth All
youre getting is what the
witnesses say and that’s only part
of the story

EXT LIZS HOUSE - DAY
Liz exits with an AA bible Finds a letter in her mailbox

TED (VO)
This is mine the only one I know

She opens it immediately when she sees who it’s from
INT RAIFORD PRISON - DAY

In the ultra high security of death row a TV broadcasts
Ronald Reagan’s presidential inauguration

TED (VO)
In a way this is my opening
statement
INT CELLBLOCK E - DAY

Floating down rows of impenetrable iron cells

INT WINDOWLESS CELL - TIME UNKNOWN

A heavy door shuts and locks The voiceover matches the
“Dear Liz” letter Ted’s writing

TED (VO)
And what we’ve seen here is just
the first round of a long battle
From behind we see Ted standing all alone in his cramped
cell With a piece of charcoal he draws on the wall the
great arcing silhouette of a shark
CUT TO BLACK

TED (VO)
Love ted

We think it’s over until

INT HIGH SECURITY VISITATION ROOM - DAY
A TV BROADCASTS George HW Bush’s presidential inauguration

Guards usher in Ted now 42 thinner gaunt lacking the
sturdy frame of his youth He shuffles in leg chains and
handcuffs but stops dead when he sees who’s waiting for him

---LIZ
A long beat of silence

Ted shuffles over sits across from her She looks
healthier stronger Something inside her has flourished
while something inside him has shriveled

Neither know what to say

LIZ
I spent nine years thinking what
Id say when I saw you again -- if
I saw you again -- but I couldn’t
think of a single thing except all
the cliches people say to each
other when a long time has passed

Pain behind Ted’s smile as he notices Liz’s wedding ring

LIZ
Rebecca’s taller than me now

Remnants of their connection remain after all this time

LIZ
(beat)
Ted I didn’t come to catch up I
came because I need something from
you I need to hear the truth

TED
It’s all there in the letter

LIZ
I must have read it five hundred
times

TED

It’s all true

LIZ
I know it is but it isn’t the
whole truth

(MORE)

LIZ (CONTD)
There are detectives from seven
states out there lined up with
armloads of open case files

TED
It’s never going to stop is it

LIZ
It will stop with the truth

TED
There is no truth only
controversy

LIZ
Did you do it

TED
No

LIZ
I’ve carried this horrible guilt
for so long that I’ve ruined your
life that I’m to blame for
everything and I know there’s no
rational reason for me to feel this
way but my body can’t accept it
until I hear you say it You’re
the only one who can release me

TED
Oh Liz you’ve always been
insatiable

LIZ
Ted I need this

TED
Youve obviously come here with an
agenda and I’m sorry I can’t give
you what you want

LIZ
You never got mad when I told you
what I did I always wondered if
it really was all my fault how it
was so easy for you to forgive me
Just like that

TED
Because I loved you What’s done
was done What was the use of
anger

LIZ
Did you kill those girls

TED
No

LIZ
Ted are you sick

TED
(barks )
Back off

A startling beat Ted dials it back Soft sensitive

TED
Not you Liz Anyone but you

Liz produces a manila envelope from her purse -- the one
Detective Fisher left at her house all those years ago From
it she withdraws a 9x11 photograph and lays it facedown on
the table in front of Ted

Ted hesitates then flips it over We don’t see the photo
we just SLOWLY PUSH IN on him looking down at it

LIZ
It’s from 1974 before you left for
law school We’d been dating for
five years already

Ted’s jaw protrudes his carotid artery bulges from his neck
with a pounding pulse

LIZ
Ted

Ted looks up pupils chillingly dilated to the size of dimes

LIZ
What happened to her head

An unbearably long and unsettling beat Her eyes plead with
him He looks again at the photo shakes his head confused

TED
If she was deposited in the woods
animals could have conceivably--

LIZ
Animals don’t do that

Ted’s lips tremble

TED
Don’t make me say it I’m nota
bad guy

LIZ

You need to release me

Liz places a pencil on the table Room tone louder than
thunder Finally Ted takes the pencil and writes on the
back of the photograph

Liz skids up out of her chair gasping in revolt Her eyes
fill with shock awe horror tears

Scrawled on the paper is one word

“hacksaw”

His eyes downcast his face pale with shame Ted makes no
effort to explain He is in this precise moment lost to
her

WE STAY WITH LIZ retreating from her former lover a
complete and monstrous stranger now

She beelines for the door Bangs to be let out

INT PRISON HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Liz hurries through security checkpoints tears streaming
INT WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

past a LONG LINE OF DETECTIVES -- there’s Mike Fisher --
all with intimidating loads of open case files

EXT RAIFORD PRISON - DAY

into the claustrophobic humidity where she finally lets
free a maelstrom of emotion released in an instant

It’s not sadness or even shock It’s a great burden leaving
her -- guilt -- insecurity -- self-loathing -- codependency --

Ted
And there waiting for her next to a cheap rental car

are JERRY and REBECCA (now a beautiful teenager) They
wrap their arms around Liz -- her journey complete

INT RENTAL CAR - DAY

Jerry drives them onto the deserted highway that cuts through
the vast wasteland that is Starke Florida Liz grabs
Rebecca’s hand as Raiford prison recedes in the distance
SUPER

Ted Bundy was executed on January 24 1989 Days before his
execution he confessed to 30 murders He is suspected of
many more Most of his victims have never been found

He was cremated and scattered in the Cascades one of the
resting spots of many of his victims

Liz still lives in Washington with her family She is sober

Carole Ann gave birth to a girl fathered by Ted while on
death row Their whereabouts are unknown

WE STAY ON LIZ Moving forward Starting new Strong
