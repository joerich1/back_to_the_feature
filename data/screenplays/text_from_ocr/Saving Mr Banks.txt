SAVING MR BANKS

Written by

Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith

EXT MARYBOROUGH PARK - AUSTRALIA - DAY OVER BLACK
MUSIC - string violins treat us to a familiar song opening
and then a voice - male

TRAVERS (VO)

(SINGING)
Winds in the East
Mist coming in--

FADE IN
A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky spinning
spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst
white fluffy clouds A shadow (oddly shaped like an
umbrella)
dances amongst the nimbus

TRAVERS (VO)

--Like something is brewing

about to begin--

The shadows direction becomes purposeful - taking us down
through the clouds whipping us on the wind towards a small
town in the distance

TRAVERS (VO)
--Cant put me finger on what lies

IN STORE--

Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large
bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens
There a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass she puts
the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large
park she sits in - benches made from twigs trees from

nod

of

the

flowers picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied

She wraps her arms tightly around her chest lifts her face
to the sky a half-smile threatening to break across her
concentrated face This is the young PL TRAVERS (whom we
will also know as GINTY)

TRAVERS (VO)
--But I feel whats to happen all

HAPPENED BEFORE--
Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then all

a sudden the smile breaks free as something in her mind
becomes real

INT SHAWFIELD ST - PAMELAS OFFICE - LONDON - MORNING

PL TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position
as above) arms clasped tightly around her body face to the
sky Older beautiful striking blue eyes aid her air of
stiff and steely determination

Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled Buddha
smiles from every corner framed poetry and letters adorn

walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with
men we will not come to know and everywhere china hens sit
on shelves their wings clasped to their chests brooding
Despite the multitude of objects the room is peaceful
white

Downstairs the doorbell rings

Pamela closes her eyes breathes

It rings again Pamela shakes her head tuts She stands up
smooths down her skirt with flat palms Breathes

INT SHAWFIELD ST - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING

Pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of
sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold
DIARMUID RUSSELL - bright youthful - waits to be asked
inside Pamela is not pleased to see him

DIARMUID
Mrs Travers

INT PAMELAS LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Pamela and Diarmuid sit in silence Diarmuid looks at her
she looks out of the window

DIARMUID PAMELA
Youre ready to-- Like pink clouds on sticks

DIARMUID
Excuse me

PAMELA
The cherry blossoms

(BEAT)
I was trying to think of what they--
Diarmuid looks at his watch

DIARMUID

Weve been through this--

PAMELA

DIARMUID

PAMELA

With all due respect Mr Russell I

Diarmuids shoulders visibly sag he lets out a long
frustrated breath

DIARMUID

PAMELA
Why in the world are you speaking
to me as if I am a neonate

DIARMUID
HELL--

PAMELA

DIARMUID

(HE SIGHS)
--Ive represented you for a long
time I like to think of you as a

FRIEND--
Pamela snorts

DIARMUID (CONTD)
I like to think of it believe me I
know its not reciprocated

(BEAT)
I would never suggest you do
something that would cause you
anguish but theres no more money
Pamela-- Mrs Travers Simply no
more Sales have dried up no more
royalties You refuse to write

(BEAT)
Do you understand Im frightened

Pamela looks out of the window the cherry blossom her

PAMELA
I know what hes going to do to her-
- shell be cavorting and
twinkling Careening towards a
happy ending like a kamikaze--

DIARMUID
--Weve been trying to do this deal

both your stipulations No

PAMELA
Use her to pay my bills If I
believed in a hell Id be sitting
in its waiting room--

DIARMUID

(OVER)
--script approval Hes never
granted anything like that before
I dont know what else to--
He looks around

DIARMUID (CONTD)
Where is Polly

PAMELA
I fired her
Diarmuid shakes his head sighs

PAMELA (CONTD)
Its just as well It seems I cant
afford her anymore anyway
Pamela looks to the ceiling breathes

PAMELA (CONTD)

(MOMENTARILY SOFT)
You dont know how much she means
to me

DIARMUID

PAMELA

Pamela huffs digs her heel into the rug

away
from the tree and sticks to her living room window

(TO HERSELF)

EXT BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY
With its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel

resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun
The limo glides into the forecourt

A porter opens the door to Pamelas suite and places her
belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway

PORTER
Would you like me to unpack for you

PAMELA
Unpack

PORTER

To take your items from their cases
and hang them in the wardrobe
maam

PAMELA
Young man if it is your wish to

launderette
The porter has no idea what to say he hovers at the door
disgust

lush

PAMELA (CONTD)
Yes
His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela She
closes the door on him

PAMELA (CONTD)
Odd
She turns and for the first time takes in--

PAMELA (CONTD)
Oh my
--The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned it is opulent
beyond imagine but its classy decor has been rather
diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across
every surface of the room

PAMELA (CONTD)
Oh no no no
Disney Flowers Disney champagne Disney exotic fruit
baskets Disney chocolates Disney posters cuddly Donald
Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the
BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable Imagine it Nope

BIGGER
Pamela cannot contain her horror She stares at it in

for a moment and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the
fruit basket She stops still for a second before rushing
over and picking them out She turns them over in her hands
before an enormous wave of panic washes over her

PAMELA (CONTD)
(muttering to the pears)
This wont do
She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is
greeted with dry arid heat dust dazzling sunlight--

EXT GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY

--Arid heat dazzling sunlight Travers Margaret and the
children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway From
their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling
red dust it obscures and then gradually reveals her new
home The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the

greens of Maryborough The house is ramshackle and meagre
A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few
skinny chickens strut about the porch
TRAVERS
A palace Complete with mighty

steed
GINTY
And chickens
MARGARET
OH--

Travers puts an arm around her shoulder

TRAVERS
Well build beautiful memories here
my angel
Margaret offers him a trusting smile

MARGARET
Yes
Travers takes Ginty and Biddys hands and they run towards
their new home The chickens scatter

TRAVERS
(in the distance)
--in this house you get to share a
bedroom
Margaret looks at the surrounding area theres simply
nothing but barren land and red dust for miles

EXT BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - DAY

another SPLOSH
We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony
throwing the pears one by one into the swimmer-free
swimming pool

Good riddance
She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors

(TO HERSELF)
Well first things first
She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in
a closet
She picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where
the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable takes up the
entire bed Imagine it Nope BIGGER

PAMELA (CONTD)
Good Lord
Pamela drops her bags grabs Mickey and places him on the
floor facing the wall

PAMELA (CONTD)

(TO MICKEY)
And you can stay there until you
learn the art of subtlety
Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack She takes
from it a bottle of pills which she places on her night
stand followed by another bottle and another and another
The potions keep coming as do creams and books and make-up
the bag is endless Things things and more things come
streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she

windowsills and any other available surface for her

Buddhas Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed
picture of herself She holds it up admires it takes down
an existing painting and replaces it with her own image

PAMELA (CONTD)
There
Pamela is restless she looks around the room stands in
front of a full length mirror admiring herself She turns
her face slightly to catch it at its best angle She leans
forward and explores the contours of her face surprisingly
unlined for a woman of her years She smiles full of

PAMELA (CONTD)

(SATISFIED)
Yes
(answering an imaginary

QUESTION)
Well no I dont suppose I do
mind
She laughs but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out

an ugly snort
realizes

PAMELA (CONTD)

Now really Flatterer

(then scolding herself)

Silly girl
She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a
remote control staring at it with bemusement She points it
at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the
TV bursts into life

PAMELA (CONTD)
Oh
She clicks again the TV goes off again and its on A
housewife advertises dish soap with glee as if dish soap is
the greatest thing ever invented

PAMELA (CONTD)

Soap for the brains

She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man ona
black and white screen It takes a moment before she

that staring back at her is the charming moustached kindly
face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY on The Wonderful World of
Disney Show Pamela raises an eyebrow--

PAMELA (CONTD)
Well well-- There you are

CU TV SCREEN
Walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out

WALT

pixie bell the sound is much too
high for human ears
Tinkerbell flies into shot

WALT (CONTD)
Oh there you are Tink
She covers Walt in fairy dust

WALT (CONTD)

(LAUGHING)
Hey Get that stuff off of me

(TO AUDIENCE)
You know a little sprinkling of
fairy dust can make you fly
Pamela cant help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then
just as quickly narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and
there

her

switches him off

PAMELA
Off Thats how we deal with you

EXT SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL
A tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door

her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in

The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside

bed

EXT BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING

Pamela waits under the hotel awning dressed immaculately
not a hair out of place The limo pulls up to the curb and

serenely towards the man who rushes down the corridor to
greet her

He picks up the pot again and pours the tea

PAMELA (CONTD)
And a spoonful of sugar
He stirs

PAMELA (CONTD)

He presents her with the cup

PAMELA
No

WALT
No

PAMELA
No

She takes a sip he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any
good

PAMELA (CONTD)
Not bad No Mister Disney Mary
Poppins does not sing

WALT
Oh yes she does

PAMELA
When

WALT
In your books

PAMELA

Those arent songs Theyre

recitations She is not a giddy

woman she does not jig Singing is

frivolous and wholly unnecessary

for a governess an educatress No

It would just ruin it
Walt is baffled He takes a sip of tea its disgusting he
spits it back into his cup surreptitiously then coughs
loudly Pamelas jaw drops

PAMELA (CONTD)
I wont have her turned into one of
your silly cartoons
Walt takes a sharp breath on ‘silly and then plasters the
smile back on

WALT
Tell ya what You just listen to
what my Sherman boys have come up
with and if they dont knock your
socks off then Im the King of
England
Pamela rolls her eyes
PAMELA
If youre the King of England then

The pages are worn down to tissue
dog eared and falling out I have
poured over them gripped
tormented Because I love Mary
Poppins you got to share her with

Pamela is torn between finding Disney captivating and
totally
barking

WALT (CONTD)
A course nothing happens without
your say so Absolutely Nothing

PAMELA
Quite right
She extricates her hand

WALT
Its all in the rights agreement
As approved by your agent Dermot

PAMELA

WALT

Disney hands the rights agreement and a pen to her
takes it without looking and folds it up

purposefully strides out of the room a smile across her

and re-takes her seat

Everybody waits

Pamela flicks her eyes at the tape recorder which Don duly

Don DaGradi and the Shermans are escorting Pamela along a
row

of storyboard illustrations for the film Dolly trundles
along behind carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which
Pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from

DON
We do find it helps to have a
visual Its fun
She stops in front of a sketch of the Banks house

PAMELA
No no no Goodness no

DICK
No

PAMELA
The Banks house doesnt look like
that My house is a terraced house
with a pink door white bricked
with a crack in the gable The
window frames are lead-lined and
the flower boxes grow pink
nasturtiums to go with the pink

DOOR AND--

HYSTERICAL)
Oh dear its all a big mistake
Its all wrong

Its too grand The Banks family -
theyre normal everyday sort of
people This isnt normal It isnt
everyday Theyre not aristocrats

DICK
Interesting
Don allows a tiny smile She is right Pamela lingers over a
picture of the parrot head umbrella a split second of
something like recognition on her face and then she simply
moves on

PAMELA

(TO HERSELF)
Okay
She stops again in front of a sketch of Mrs Banks wearing a
suffragette ribbon

PAMELA (CONTD)

(SIGHING)
Do I even have to say it
DON
Um-- yeah
PAMELA

Why in the world have you made Mrs
Banks a silly suffragette

BOB
I wonder if Emmeline P would agree
with that adjective--

PAMELA
Quite possibly looking back
Dick mouths ‘oh my god

DON
It does seem strange that Mrs Banks
allows her children to spend all of
their time with the nanny when she
has no job to speak of--

PAMELA
Are you calling Mrs Banks
neglectful

BOB
Yep

DON

No Of course not We just felt
that if she had a job it would go
some way to explaining--

PAMELA

Being a mother is a job A very

difficult job and one that not

everybody is up to that not

everybody should have taken on in

the first place

The boys see that Pamela is talking about something
meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief
moment until--

PAMELA (CONTD)
I will NOT have her called Cynthia
Absolutely not It feels unlucky
Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob

PAMELA (CONTD)

mouth

PAMELA (CONTD)

DON
Ahm yeah thats him--

Pamela averts her eyes for a split second embarrassed about
“creating something beautiful with Walt but quickly
recovers and eyeballs him right back

PAMELA
I took you at your word Mr Disney

has been denied There will be many
more so-- perhaps we should just
call it quits and I should hand you

Ginty and Travers sit by the river Ginty eats an enormous
ice cream and Travers sips continuously from his hip flask

TRAVERS
We share a Celtic soul you and I
This world is just an illusion
Ginty old girl As long as we hold

possible my love Find yourself a
patch of green

(HE SIGHS)
Its a chimera you know The world

whackety-whack-Belhatchett All an
illusion
He stares across the river experiencing a wave of deep
melancholy Ginty looks up at him aware of his profound
unhappiness but unable to understand its source

PAMELA (CONTD)

She hangs up the phone and continues sitting upright Wide
awake Staring into the darkness

Pamela checks through her multitude of pill bottles for
something to help her Nothing She groans as she drags
herself out of bed pacing the room counting steps

PAMELA (CONTD)
Serves me right Money money

Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse She drags it onto

bed with her and climbs back under the covers clinging onto
the stuffed toy for comfort

INT REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING

nd models of the sets all about the place And of course

etching energetically on his notepad what seems to be a
cartoon sketch of Pamela Travers

Dick throws his hands and legs in the air almost falling off
his stool

DON

Yeah we have sugar

EXT DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - MORNING
Pamela steps from the car and Walt is there to greet her

WALT
May I walk with you

PAMELA
Im sure your country doesnt have
any laws about sharing a pavement
As they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the
rehearsal room window and down onto the lot

INT REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING
Dick is playing about with a verse

BOB
Go back to the chorus

DICK and BOB
(singing it incorrectly)
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the
medicine go down

BOB
Wait WAIT She always does whats
unexpected
She goes UP the bannisters
Dick is confused

BOB (CONTD)
So go up
Dick plays a high note

BOB (CONTD)
Try B
He takes a pencil from behind his ear and marks Dicks sheet
music Dick immediately begins finding the tune on the piano

DICK and BOB
(singing down in an up

KEY)
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the
medicine go down
Don looks up from his sketching

DICK
Yes
The sound of Walts cough signals his imminent arrival

DON
Man is in the forest
Pamela and Walt enter the room

DON (CONTD)

(TO WALT)
I want you to hear this
(to the boys)

Walt takes a seat beside the piano Pamela folds her arms
across her chest defiantly

DICK
Its just a chorus--

BOB
Tell us what you think
He knows dum dum

Bob whistles what will end up being the Robins part of the
song

DON
Its ironic

PAMELA

WALT

Forget ironic its iconic
Pamela rolls her eyes

PAMELA

(SARCASTIC)
Bravo

WALT
I wont be able to stop singing
that for weeks

PAMELA

It seems enormously patronising to
me The very sort of annoying tune
you would have playing in your
themed park I daresay All giddy
and carefree encouraging children
to face the world unarmed All they
need is a spoon and some sugar and
a brain full of fluff and theyre
equipped with lifes tools
Wonderful
Dick is completely deflated

WALT
Whats your point Pam

PAMELA
MRS Travers My point is that
unlike yourself Mary Poppins is
the very enemy of sentiment and
whimsy She is truthful she
doesnt sugar coat the darkness in
the world that these children will
eventually come to know She
prepares them for it she deals in
honesty One must clean ones room
it wont magically do it itself
She waves the script in the air
PAMELA (CONTD)
This whole script is flim flam
Where is its reality Where is its
heart where is the gravitas
She opens a window and flings the script out

PAMELA (CONTD)
No weight Mister Disney See
Dick Don and Bob look out of the window as the pages
flutter

downwards and spread themselves over the Disney lot

WALT
No whimsy or sentiment says the
woman who sends a flying nanny with
a talking umbrella to save the
children

PAMELA
You think Mary Poppins is saving
the children Mr Disney
Pamela sighs shakes her head

PAMELA (CONTD)
Oh dear

EXT DISNEY STUDIOS - LATE AFTERNOON

whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket she slips

back inside - out of sight out of mind

The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets the last
deafening chorus of the birds

Travers walks up the path to their home trailing his suit
jacket over his shoulder his shirt and tie loosened His
shirtsleeves are marked with sweat His face is a study of
something close to despair

He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and
immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of
greeting

concentrating so hard on

looks around for some more Pamela takes a stick and digs a
small line through the grass then hands it to him

Margaret begins to weep

Ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother
wading into the water to grab hold of her
Ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep

seat on the very next flight let

Walter
He looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking

WALT
How about you show me how to make
one of those nice English pots of
tea

INT PAMELAS DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Pamela sits at the table as Disney carries in a tray with a
teapot a milk jug a sugar bowl and two cups These he
places on the table and proceeds to pour tea

PAMELA
Milk The milk goes in first
He attends to it

WALT
I remember

PAMELA

And whiskey Ill have whiskey in
mine

Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter

She

it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup

WALT

(SURPRISED)
Oh

(BEAT)
Oh well when in Rome
He pours a slug into his tea too

PAMELA
Youve come to change my mind To
beat me into submission

WALT
No Ive come because you misjudge
me

PAMELA
How do I misjudge you

WALT
You look at me and you see some
kind of Hollywood King Midas

(MORE)

WALT (CONTD)
You think Ive built an empire and
that I want to use your Mary
Poppins as just another brick in my
kingdom You think I see her with a
carpetbag full of greenbacks

PAMELA
And dont you

WALT
If that was all it was would I have
pursued an cranky stubborn dame
like you for twenty years Idve
have saved myself an ulcer

(BEAT)
No you expected me to disappoint
you and so you made sure I did You
see I think life disappoints you
Mrs Travers I think its done
that a lot Maybe Mary Poppins is
the only person in your life who
hasnt

PAMELA
Mary Poppins isnt real

WALT

Oh no thats not true Shes real
as can be to my daughters and to
thousands of other children--
adults too Shes been there as a
nighttime comfort to a heck of a
lot of people

PAMELA

Well Where is she when I need her
Hm I open the door to Mary Poppins
and who should be standing there
but Walt Disney

He laughs

WALT
Mrs Travers I am so sorry I hoped
this would be a magical experience
for you for all of us But I let
you down-- and in doing so Ive
broken a twenty year old promise to
my girls

(BEAT)
Ive been wracking my brains
trying to figure out why this has
been so hard for you and I--

(BEAT)
You see I have my own Mr Banks
Mine had a moustache

PAMELA
Ah Not true then that Disney
created man in his own image

WALT
But it is true that you created
yourself in someone elses yes

She doesnt answer Walt takes mouthful of laced tea and

coughs a little

WALT (CONTD)
Ever been to Kansas City Mrs
Travers Do you know Missouri at
all

PAMELA
Cant say I do and as I have no
plans to ever set foot on American
soil again Im afraid I never will

WALT
Its mighty cold there in the
winters Bitter
Walt stops talking catches himself

looks away and then

gives in His enthusiasm completely disappears and hes
suddenly as ragged and as weary as Pamela

WALT (CONTD)
(it pours out)
My dad Elias Disney he owned a
newspaper delivery route there
Thousand papers Twice daily
Morning and evening edition Elias
he was a tough businessman A save-
a-penny anywhere you can type of
fella so he wouldnt employ any
delivery boys he just used me and
my big brother Roy I was eight
then-- eight years old

(BEAT)
Like I said those winters were
harsh and old Elias didnt believe
in new shoes until the old ones
were worn right through so--

(BEAT)
Honestly Mrs Travers the snow
would be up to here--
He gestures to his knees

WALT (CONTD)
Youd push through it like wading
through molasses

(MORE)

WALT (CONTD)
And the cold and the wet would be
seeping through the shoes and the
skin would be raw and peeling from
our faces-- and sometimes Id find
myself sunk down in the snow
waking up cuz I mustve passed out
for a moment-- I dunno Then
school too cold to figure out an
equation And back into the snow so
by the time we got home itd be
just getting dark and every part
of you would sting like crazy as it
slowly came back to life in the
warmth My mother would feed us
dinner and then itd be time to go
out again for the evening edition

(BEAT)
Best be quick Walt best be quick
or poppas gonna show you the
buckle end again boy
Walt smiles at Pamela sips his tea

WALT (CONTD)
Now I dont tell you all this to
make you sad Mrs Travers I dont
I love my life - its a miracle
And I loved my daddy boy I loved
him But there isnt a day goes by
where I dont think of that little
boy in the snow and old Elias with
his fist and strap and Im just so
tired-- Im tired of remembering it
that way Arent you tired Mrs
Travers We all have our tales but
dont you want to find a way to
finish the story Let it all go and
have a life that isnt dictated by
a past

(BEAT)
ts not the children she comes to
save Its their father

WALT
You mustve loved and admired him a
lot to take his name--

PAMELA

Pamela looks at her hands theyre shaking

WALT (CONTD)
Forgiveness Its what I learned
from your books

PAMELA
I dont need to forgive my father
He was a wonderful man

WALT
No you need to forgive Helen Goff
Life is a harsh sentence to lay
down for yourself
Pamela looks down at the table top

WALT (CONTD)
Give her to me Mrs Travers Trust
me with your precious Mary Poppins
I wont disappoint you I swear
that every time a person goes into
a movie house - from Leicester to
St Louis they will see George
Banks being saved They will love
him and his kids they will weep
for his cares and wring their
hands when he loses his job And
when he flies that kite oh They
will rejoice they will sing In
every movie house all over the
world in the eyes and the hearts
of my kids and other kids and
their mothers and fathers for
generations to come George Banks
will be honoured George Banks will
be redeemed George Banks and all
he stands for will be saved
Maybe not in life but in
imagination Because thats what we
storytellers do We restore order
with imagination We instill hope
again and again and again Trust
me Mrs Travers Let me prove it to
you I give you my word

EXT GRAUMANS CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

Its spectacular Disneys biggest Hollywood opening Bulbs
flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red
carpet Ushers are dressed as English bobbies Reporters
stand on podiums in colourful suits Penguins dance their
hearts out in front of the theater Pearly Kings and Queens
play for the onlookers Crowds and crowds of fans scream
every time a bulb flashes waving their autograph books and
posters in the air Every Disney character imaginable

up and down the lines of well-wishers hugging them dancing
for them signing their booklets Hollywood Blvd is

completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest
party you could ever go to

INT LIMO - NIGHT
Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds Onlookers
press their faces against the windows trying to make out who

is inside Pamela is nervous everyone else has someone with
them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone

EXT GRAUMANS CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD -NIGHT
The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps

He rushes round to Pamelas side and helps her from the car
arm

and

her

Travers

Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her
up to shield her eyes Its too much

RALPH

(in her ear)

This is your night None of this

would be possible without you
She brings her arm down straightens her dress and breaks
into a smile making her way down the carpet to frantic
whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of Who is
that Is that anyone Pamela spots Walt Dick Van Dyke

Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead

Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and
Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment He holds out his gloved
hand she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy
train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds
of coloured balloons fly out of its roof and into the air

EXT GRAUMANS CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHT

Pamela moves through the spangling glittering perfect
toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to

INT GRAUMANS CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The auditorium is jam packed Pamela is seated in front of
Walt Disney Don the Shermans and their families are in the
same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her The lights begin
to dim The overture begins--

We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade
and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of

old melodys rings in her ears

We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain
with Pamela

She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing
humming sad happy joyous

Intercut with images from Pamelas childhood and the voices
of Bert and Jane -

Ellies parrot head umbrella--

BERT
You know begging your pardon but
the one my heart goes out to is
your father
The carousel horses at the Allora fair--

BERT (CONTD)
There he is in that cold heartless
bank day after day hemmed in by
mounds of cold heartless
money
The tuppence and rolling pears--

BERT (CONTD)
I dont like to see any living
thing caged up
Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back carrying her river
soaked mother back to the house--

JANE
Father in a cage
Ginty pressing the final bottle into her fathers hand--

BERT
They makes cages in all sizes and
shapes you know
The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--

BERT (CONTD)
Bank-shaped some of em carpets
and all

Rapt

MICHEAL
You wont ever leave us will you

JANE
Whatever would we do without you

MARY POPPINS

I shall stay until the wind

changes
And then an image from the film

George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined
London street on his way to be fired from the bank
Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction

Pamela however has tears coursing down her face Her
shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud
but people are noticing looking at her
Disney leans forward placing a hand on her shoulder She
reaches up and grips it tightly unable to speak

WALT
Its all right Mrs Travers Its

alright Mr Banks is going to be

all right I promise

Pamela nods in gratitude but cannot contain her sobs Its
all pouring from her now in one immense catharsis

PAMELA

No no Its just that-- I cant I

cant abide cartoons

We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the
film Lets Go Fly A Kite The audience around her are
smiling laughing singing along Pamela the tears silent
now still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to
mouth along with the lyrics
And in her head one final image appears

Travers gaze falls upon Ginty outside his bedroom window
sweeping Their eyes meet for a brief moment an unspoken
understanding of what is to come before his close with
tiredness

TRAVERS (VO)
Never I promise I will never lose
you

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY

The shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten-year-old Ginty
sitting in the lush grass arms wrapped tightly around her
chest face to the sky as a smile breaks free across her
face

TRAVERS (VO)

(SINGING)
Winds in the East
Mist coming in--
The shadow of an umbrella floats higher and higher--

TRAVERS
--Like something is brewing
about to begin--
And further and further--

TRAVERS (CONTD)
Cant put me finger on what lies in
Pp g

We give chase but cannot catch up--
TRAVERS (CONTD)
But I feel whats to happen all

HAPPENED BEFORE--
And the umbrella floats up up up into the atmosphere and

AWAY--
FADE OUT
