READER NOTE

One thing that will be obvious to viewers but not
to readers is that the nine principal parts in this
film are played by only three actors

1) Gary Gavin Gabriel

2) Sarah Susan Sierra

3) Margaret Melissa Mary

Itll make more sense in context Promise

A MANS HAND

unwinds a short length of green string Were extremely
close with a shallow blurry focus Its like the first
moments after a dream -- just fragments

Scissors cut the string The man wraps it around his left
wrist A loop A bracelet

We see the mans teeth the edge of his chin as he pulls the
knot tight

His fingers pull against the string Solid It wont break
easily

FADE OUT

PITCH BLACK

Theres no music No sound at all really except for some
distant birds CHIRPING

Then a SQUEAK A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage

A GARAGE DOOR LIFTS

revealing GARY BANKS in silhouette Hes 30 effortlessly
fit with movie-star good looks (Although for now hes
merely a TV star)

Like most Laurel Canyon garages this one has never held a
car Instead its the resting place for all the detritus of
bachelordom shitty Ikea furniture a drum set a styrofoam
snowman and the Harley he always meant to get running

Gary spots what he was looking for

CUT TO

EXT BACK PATIO LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR (DAWN)

Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle One of its wheels is
broken SCRAPING against the deck

WIDER we see Garys house has an incredible view of the
city He couldnt fucking care less

He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it
down the canyon

He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue mostly womens

clothes but also some stuffed animals and photos still in

their frames Theres too much to fit so he tries stomping
it down with a flip-flopped foot

He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins

drenching everything inside He sprays until the container
is WHEEZING air He shakes it making sure its really
empty

Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying And
spraying

We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of
Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN Her eyes are scratched out making

her unrecognizable

Under the grill lighter fluid is dripping in a stream
soaking into the wooden deck

Finally satisfied Gary throws the lighter fluid aside He

takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his
pocket

EXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES erupting in flames
On Garys left wrist we see a green string bracelet

MUSIC STARTS a pounding hypnotic track that will carry us
through these MAIN TITLES

In EPIC SLOW-MOTION we follow the burning match as it sails
through the air tumbling end-over-end

Just as its about to reach its target we

CUT TO

A DIGITAL METER

shoots to 100 miles per gallon Its the display of Garys
Prius We are

INT SHITTY MOTEL ROOM - DAY

phrase

PAROLE OFFICER

She drops it in the contraband

Margaret notices a long butane lighter by the
just to be sure

INT HOUSE VARIOUS - DAY
Gary paces around his new home trying to get a feel for it
He plays a few NOTES on the piano
He looks up at the painting over the staircase a cliff near
the ocean
He opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet wondering
if theres anything hidden in one of the 46 slots There
isnt
He takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the
dining room which show the same thing in three different
ways

EXT BACKYARD - SUMMER NIGHT
Gary swims laps trying to exhaust himself
He stands in the shallow end listening to the quiet

INT KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT
Wearing a fluffy white robe he looks through the delivery
menus

INT FOYER FRONT DOOR - SUMMER NIGHT

He takes a bag of food from a college-age DELIVERY GUY who
seems to recognize him Gary pays him shuts the door

As hes walking to the kitchen with the food Gary looks back
and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk
The guy is a little embarrassed but Gary is pretty used to
being stared at

INT KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT

Gary unwraps the Thai food Makes himself a plate

He watches CRIME LAB on the plasma screen while eating
dinner

GARY (0S TV DIALOGUE)
Once we get these samples back to
the Crime Lab well know who the
real killer is

INT LIBRARY TV ROOM - NIGHT

Gary scans the shelves looking for something to read There
are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his
lifetime

He settles on a paperback of Voltaires Candide
He lies back on the couch reading it

He flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more
interesting A beat

CUT TO

GARY JACKING OFF

face but we can hear the pleasured MOANS of the actresses as
they go down on each other

Nearing climax he looks for something to come on He cant
find anything

INT FOYER - NIGHT

His left hand cupped to hold the semen he pads barefoot from
the TV room to the downstairs bathroom We hear WATER
RUNNING as he washes his hands Then it shuts off

We hear a THUNK Something hard was dropped on the wood
floor

Gary hears it too
He steps out of the bathroom looks around He takes a few
silent paces back in our direction stopping just before he

reaches the two-story section of the foyer

Thats when he hears it CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the
wooden floor A JINGLE of metal

We follow Garys eyes up to the second-floor walkway We can
hear the little FOOTSTEPS toe nails CLICKING Faint
PANTING But theres no dog

BACK ON Gary increasingly unsettled Hes directly below
the walkway and cant see up into it

GARY
Is somebody there Hello

He CLAPS his hands twice Listens

Nothing

Hes about to venture a step forward when suddenly
THE PHONE RINGS

He nearly jumps out of his skin It RINGS two more times
before he ducks into the TV room to answer it

GARY (CONTD)

Hello
(relieved)
Yes Yes

He turns his back to the foyer listening to the instructions
on the phone

GARY (CONTD)
Nine leopards run through the
jungle

into the foyer

Give them a woman of indeterminate
age who solves riddles and they are
in hee-haw heaven

GARY

MARGARET

hits him on the head

where the ball came from until he hears a voice from beyond
the wall that separates the properties

WOMANS VOICE
Sorry Really sorry

(A practiced ear notices a Canadian accent)

WOMANS VOICE (CONTD)

He follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner
of the yard finding SARAH GLEASON Late 30s fresh-
scrubbed and girlish she looks more fragile than she really

How about you Any history of
arson
SARAH

Strangely enough

A long beat while she decides whether she wants to tell him
the story

SARAH (CONTD)
Okay When I was a little girl
our house caught on fire

GARY
Oh shit

MUSIC begins providing backing to her monologue

SARAH
Ill never forget the look on my
fathers face as he gathered me up
in his arms and raced through the
burning building out onto the
pavement

ON GARY feeling bad he brought this up but fascinated at
the same time

SARAH (CONTD)
I stood there shivering in my
pajamas and watched the whole world
go up in flames And when it was
all over I said to myself Is
that all there is to a fire Is
that all there is

As she starts to SING Gary realizes the story isnt hers at
all Its Peggy Lees Is That All There Is

SARAH (CONTD)
Is that all there is is that all there is
If thats all there is my friends then lets
keep dancing

She leans closer

SARAH (CONTD)
Lets break out the booze and have a ball
If thats all there is

Standing up Sarah takes Garys hands pulling him off the
couch She leads him to an open area -- more space for
dancing

EXT WILSHIRE BLVD - NIGHT

HEADLIGHTS FLARE as cars travel down Miracle Mile bringing
us to a Metro Bus stop -- a semi-enclosed bench with backlit
signage

The far side of the shelter has a one-sheet for Crime Lab

(This fall Mondays are murder) The bench side is a promo
poster for a show called Knowing (Some fates are chosen
for you)

Its here we find Gary taking a seat gingerly checking his
toes where the rat trap snapped Hes hobbled his way here
from the house which is probably a block away

Theres only a little blood but his toes really hurt

Over Garys shoulder we see a blonde 8-year old girl
(Noelle) watching him with concern She BANGS on the shelter
to get his attention Gary nearly jumps out of his skin

to Garys left leg We see that Garys left foot also

station

She points to an electronic device by the wall

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY A FEW MINUTES LATER
CLOSE ON a white plastic device mounted in the corner of the
room about ten feet up It might be a smoke detector
Gary stares up at it intently He steps forward
A little red light flicks on inside the unit After a few
seconds it turns off Its some sort of motion detector
Gary tests it again trying to move his arm slowly enough
that the light never engages

Margaret enters carrying two mugs She watches him warily
MARGARET

MARGARET
The Nines
GARY
The Nines
MARGARET

Sort of hard to start there

GARY
Try And dont tell me Im
imagining it Theyre showing up
everywhere and I want to know why

Trying to formulate the simplest truthful explanation

MARGARET
Best guess Theyre your
subconscious trying to remind you
who you are
(offering)
Coffee
He takes the mug then reconsiders Maybe its laced with
something
GARY
Why dont you drink coffee Youre
always drinking tea
Frustrated she takes his coffee back and drinks it Shed
really like to drink the whole thing to prove her point but
its just too hot
MARGARET
Happy
She gestures for him to sit down Reluctantly he does

GARY

sense of out context

Gary gets up headed for the front door

MARGARET (CONTD)
God no Please Gary dont

But hes already outside

he sits back

EXT FRONT WALKWAY - DAY

Hes walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line headed
for Sarahs house

Leaves fall lazily from the trees counter-point to the
tension

Margaret calls out from the arched windows

MARGARET
You dont know what youre doing

Shes almost at tears He stops at the edge of the chalk
line

GARY
What happens if I cross this line

The tear in her eye falls

MARGARET
I dont know But its not good

He very deliberately steps over the line We hear a thin
BEEPING from the house-arrest anklet He shoots her a look

to say is that all there is

But the BEEPING grows louder deeper It starts to come from
all sides booming a nuclear-meltdownself-destruct-sequence-

activated DRONE

Gary suddenly realizes something very very terrible is about
to happen

GARY
Oh shit

The world ignites in white-hot atomic flames

We see the blinding glare erupt behind Margaret illuminating
through her skin right to the bone

The same flash catches a leaf in mid-air sizzling through it
like an etched x-ray

As he listens to the other side we hear a distant BOOM and
then a RUSH like autumn leaves blowing down a street

Gavin reacts though none of the PASSERSBY seem to hear it
Back to the conversation

GAVIN (CONTD)

swing nearby We can hear the DIN and MUSIC and see the
occasional GUEST looking for the restrooms

SUSAN
(on phone)

She literally shat herself No I

In the background we see Gavin approaching Susan spots him
and seizes up a bit She holds up a one-sec finger to him as

she continues her conversation

GAVIN
I will break your fucking finger

SUSAN
(to phone)
Ill call you back

She hangs up They look each other in the eye daring each

other to go first

SUSAN (CONTD)

GAVIN
The rest is what reality

SUSAN

protect you

GAVIN SUSAN

Do you believe in

GAVIN
Fuck you

SUSAN

Your dialogue used to be sharper
Maybe Gatins could do a polish

He suddenly punches her one hit to the face She drops

hard

Gavin takes a step back

Tasting blood Susan gets to her knees A wry smile

SUSAN (CONTD)

Is that all there

In the background we see partygoers responding to the blow

Susan gets to her feet She
Shes not going to hit him

is

approaches Gavin hands open

SUSAN (CONTD)
Do you feel like a man Because
Ill tell you a secret

She leans in very close to his ear Theres a strange

intimacy between them

SUSAN (CONTD)

(whisper)
Youre not

She walks away CLOSE ON Gavin

EXT MANHATTAN SIDEWALK - DAY

We move with Gavin as he walks Hes trying to get away from
the camera but it keeps following him

He reaches a crosswalk He has to wait for the light
Finally he looks INTO CAMERA

GAVIN
Look I dont want to do this
anymore My shows not going to
happen so this show is over
(MORE)

GAVIN (CONTD)
Done Gone Im not going to be
your fucking puppet

OFF-SCREEN VOICE
Are you alright

Gavin looks left where an African-American woman is waiting
for the same crosswalk (We recognize her as Octavia the
streetwalker from Part One)

GAVIN
Im fine

OCTAVIA
Who were you talking to

Gavin looks back towards camera a strange expression

MUCH WIDER

We see Gavin and the woman on the corner Theres no camera
Gavin could have been talking to Hes understandably
perplexed Where did the documentary crew go

Was there ever anyone there

Our CAMERA style has changed instead of handheld and jerky
were smooth and slow

The MUSIC has completely changed underscoring a sense of
creeping dread
We HOLD for a long beat The light changes Still a little
unnerved Octavia begins to cross the street

Only then do we notice something unusual floating above her

head

A SPHERE OF BLUE LIGHT

WIDER

we see that everyone on the street has the same kind

of sphere floating a foot above their heads No one seems to
see the lights other than Gavin

Gavin looks around in uneasy fascination as if hes just
landed on an alien world

A beat

then he has an unsettling thought

He slowly looks up Above his own head he sees the same
sphere of light -- only his is bright white Pulsing
Blinding

GAVIN
Oh God

We PULL BACK RISING UP to a perspective above and behind
Gavin As we do the edges of the frame creep in revealing
ICONS and unintelligible STATISTICS changing moment by
moment

A dialog box appears in the center of the screen reading

An arrow slides back and forth between to the two options

GARY

This is all a dream

MARGARET
No

GARY
Im in a coma

MARGARET
(amused)
No

GARY
Then Im dead This is Hell or
Purgatorium or something

MARGARET
Okay a purgatorium is where Romans
vomited But no This is as real
as anything can be

GARY

(suspicious)
What does that mean

She sits forward in her chair By instinct he sits back

MARGARET
Everything is what it is But
youre not who you think you are

GARY
Okay then Who am I

With practiced calm

MARGARET
Youre a multi-dimensional being of
vast almost infinite power You
created this world on a whim and
decided to stick around to see how
it turned out You this body
youre in is just one of your
incarnations Avatars Call you
what you will

Not sure he follows

GARY
Are you saying Im God

MARGARET
Technically no If God is a ten --
a theoretical ultimate that-which-
no-greater-can-be-imagined --
youre more of a nine

GARY
So what are you

MARGARET
Humans are sevens Monkeys are
sixes

GARY

What are the eights

MARGARET
Koalas Theyre telepathic Plus
they control the weather

She didnt mean to get on that tangent

MARGARET (CONTD)
Whats important is that you
youre the big cheese El Supremo
You could destroy the world with a
single thought

(suddenly)

Dont incidentally Just file
that away But the truth is you
hold all the cards every church
every candle every sacrifice --
thats for you When people pray
theyre not praying because they
want this thing or that thing
They just dont want to be
forgotten

MARGARET (CONTD)
So you understand I would have
told you earlier but I didnt

GARY
Yeah

EXT MEADOW - DAY

In a WIDE SHOT we see a vast field bordered by green
mountains Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees while
insects CLICK and WHIRR

In the distance we spot swatches of bright colors moving our
way Its a family father GABRIEL wife MARY and
daughter NOELLE Theyre returning from a short day

hike Mary carries a small videocamera

Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path

GABRIEL
Noelle Dont get too far ahead
Noelle turns around Instead of speaking she moves her
hands in sign language (Shes mute not deaf)

MARY

No You had ice cream at lunch

Noelle begs to differ More signing
GABRIEL
(to Mary)

Apparently frozen yogurt doesnt

count
MARY

Ill make note

EXT SMALL GRAVEL ROAD - DAY
The family walks up to their car a blue Toyota Prius
Gabriel sheds his daypack trying to open the hatchback It
wont lift
Mary goes to open the passenger door Locked
MARY

GABRIEL
Shouldnt have to

He fishes the keys out of his pocket Presses the remote
entry button repeatedly
Gabriel tries to open the drivers side door Locked Even

Noelle knows somethings wrong
Gabriel pulls the small mechanical key out of the fob
Unlocks the door and climbs in Opens the door for Mary and

Noelle

GABRIEL (CONTD)
I think we left the overhead light

Noelle leans forward aware that this is something serious

MARY
How do we

GABRIEL
We call the service Thats all we
can do

MARY

Its just the little battery thats
dead right The big one is
probably fine

GABRIEL
I guess

MARY
We cant jump it from one battery
to the other Cross-over somehow

GABRIEL
Who did you marry MacGyver

He gets out of the car retrieving his cell phone Mary
follows him out Noticing that hes not dialing

MARY
Are you getting a signal

GABRIEL
No Do you

She checks her phone A long beat

MARY

Yes One bar

Theyre both relieved Finding the AAA card in his wallet
Gabriel takes the phone and dials

Its at this moment we notice the familiar green string
bracelet around Gabriels wrist

In the back seat Noelle KNOCKS on the window She signs
asking if everything is okay

MARY (CONTD)
Were okay Daddys calling people
to help us

Gabriel pulls the phone from his ear Looks at the screen
Hits redial Fuck

GABRIEL
The minute you try to place a call

MARY
Keep trying

GABRIEL
Okay Ill keep trying Mary But
it will keep happening

MARY
Well what do you want to do

GABRIEL

He tries redial

MARY
Maybe if you hold it up higher

Humoring her he holds it at arms length No good

GABRIEL

better plan Neither does

Gabriel leans down next to Noelles window
GABRIEL
Daddys going to get a truck to
help us out You take care of your
mom okay

Noelle nods

GABRIEL (CONTD)

Gabriel gives Mary a quick peck and starts running down the
road

We MOVE IN on Noelle who smiles a little

Cut TO

EXT GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

Gravel CRUNCHES under Gabriels shoes as he runs He keeps
an easy pace

In VARIOUS SHOTS we get a sense of the distance hes
travelling He passes gulches meadows and boulder fields

He finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road anda
larger

EXT PAVED ROAD - DAY CONTINUOUS
Pulling out Marys cell phone Gabriel tries to get a signal
By his reaction its still iffy
He dials but the call drops Tries again Just the same
He looks left Looks right Looks back down the dirt road
He decides to head off to the right downhill

EXT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY

We catch up to Gabriel as hes walking in the middle of the
road still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal

In the distance he spots a patch of moving color a female
hiker A moments hesitation then he YELLS out to her

GABRIEL
Excuse me Hi Hello

She stops turns

Gabriel jogs to close the distance As we approach we
reveal SIERRA 38 In the past 10 years shes made a fresh
start 12 times In this incarnation shes a wilderness-
loving Bush-hating wildly-overeducated clerk at Trader
Joes in Venice

GABRIEL (CONTD)

GABRIEL

A beat She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the
road

GABRIEL (CONTD)
Are you headed back to your car
now If you could give me a ride
to a gas station wherever

She doesnt leap to extend an invitation It takes a beat
for Gabriel to figure out why

GABRIEL (CONTD)
Oh Hey Look Im not some crazy
Ted Bundy guy Im not going to
rape you or kill you or anything

She doesnt seem reassured

GABRIEL (CONTD)
Of course thats what Ted Bundy
would say Look Im a videogame
designer
(fishing through wallet)
My wife is an editor My daughter

He offers her a family photo She looks at it but doesnt
take it

GABRIEL (CONTD)
Theyre waiting back at the car

SIERRA

Trying to temper his frustration

GABRIEL
I believe you I do But you

be up here all night

Sierra backs away

SIERRA

GABRIEL

Once she feels shes reached a good distance she turns and
keeps walking

GABRIEL
Why wont you trust me

She doesnt turn back heading down the road

Am I crazy or is it getting
hotter
SIERRA
Oh youre crazy
She hands him back the water bottle He gladly drinks

When she takes the bottle back she steps forward The
motion leaves them face-to-face She pauses for a moment
just long enough for him to turn away

He doesnt

She kisses him He doesnt really kiss back -- but he
doesnt fight it either

She puts a hand on his thigh sliding up the inside Only
when she reaches his crotch does he pull back

GABRIEL
I have a wife And a daughter
Theyre waiting for me

SIERRA
Where are they

Back at the car

Gabriel lifts the sleeping Noelle out of the car Carries
her into the house Mary shuts the door behind them

INT NOELLES ROOM - NIGHT
Taking off her shoes Gabriel tucks Noelle into bed Turns
on a nightlight for her

INT MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Gabriel brushes his teeth with an electric toothbrush while
Mary reads a magazine on the toilet

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Gabriel switches off the light He spoons Mary who kisses

his hand On both Mary and Gabriels faces we see anxiety
Things left unsaid

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT LATER
Gabriel lies awake staring at the ceiling

INT STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Gabriels bare feet walk down the carpeted stairs

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Gabriel stares at the three paintings on the wall

INT KITCHEN EXT BACK YARD - DAWN

Gabriel stands in the doorway looking out at the inky-blue
sky His eyes are red tired He hasnt slept at all

Its very quiet except for the occasional precocious BIRD
CALL

Mary enters from the living room still in her pajamas He
knows shes there Neither wants to speak

MARY
You need to go dont you
GABRIEL
No I can stay

MARY
How long Forever Every day
youd know what you were missing

He smiles a little

MARY (CONTD)
What happens If you go

GABRIEL
Worst-case scenario Spontaneous
disintegration into a fiery void
Oblivio accebit The end of
everything

MARY
Thats all

Both smile

A beat

GABRIEL
That probably wouldnt happen The
basic structure of the universe
should hold I guess Im just
worried about the human factor
You guys kill each other a lot

MARY
In fairness thats usually in your
name Plus weve gotten much more
efficient at it

GABRIEL
I like this world I like my life
here with you and Noelle

MARY
But its not real Im not really
your wife youre not really my
husband On some level its all
pretend

GABRIEL
Its not pretend Theres a reason
With that

you were there in every version
You were my sister my wife my
best friend

MARY
Thats a little creepy

GABRIEL
I wanted you close In one
version I even told you I warned
you that some day they might come
for me and

MARY
Youd have to leave How many
versions were there

GABRIEL

Ninety This is the last one
MARY

Wow
GABRIEL

Ive destroyed billions of people
with a thought Obliterated them
And youd like to think its
painless

MARY
Stop You dont have to explain or
apologize Everything that is is
because of you If thats all
thats enough

theres really nothing more to say

MARY (CONTD)
So

GABRIEL
So

MARY
Guess you dont really need to pack
anything

GABRIEL
Im good

MARY
Youre great Its been a

pleasure
GABRIEL
Likewise I love you
MARY

Love you too Ya big lug
He kisses her Its not a big passionate movie-ending
kiss but rather a fond kiss farewell At the end of it he
WHISPERS into her ear

GABRIEL
Youre my favorite

She smiles

With two fingers Gabriel BREAKS the green string bracelet
around his left wrist

And in that moment a film passes over him like the boundary
between water and air

Hes stepped out of this dimension
Mary is frozen with the same smile on her face but we notice
that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two-

dimensional images

She and everything around her has become like wallpaper
slowly curling away revealing emptiness beneath

Gabriel collapses into a single spiky sphere of light

The light moves through the kitchen creating waves that
ripple through the tissue-thin walls

Picking up speed the sphere rushes through the window
heading west

EXT LOS ANGELES - DAY

As the light flies out over Hancock Park the mansions and
skyscrapers seem unreal like models

Reaching Santa Monica we pass over the ferris wheel at the

end of the pier

We dive into the blue ocean beneath us which becomes only a
swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness

We see three lights in the distance We join them moving
with them

Further ahead more lights circling Its a loose spiral
made of stars resembling nothing so much as the number 9

As we get closer and closer we

MATCH CUT TO

A PALE EYE
opening We are
INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Hands reach up expecting to find glasses but there are
none

As we PULL OUT we reveal its not Mary Melissa or Margaret
but a fourth person -- just slightly different from any of
them Well call her M

She looks first to the spot where Gabriel was standing

Empty

MANS VOICE (0S)
Honey do we have nutmeg

M looks over at husband Ben who is busy making pancakes
reading from a recipe
We should

Coming around from behind Ben Noelle checks through the
spice drawer M watches her with cautious fascination

BEN
Cinnamon too

M catches her reflection in the toaster Notices she looks
different than she expected

NOELLE
(to Ben)
If I had a horse

Noelle turns back with the spices handing them to Ben one at
a time

NOELLE (CONTD)
I would name her Cinnamon

BEN
Really

NOELLE
And if I had another horse

BEN
Nutmeg

NOELLE
No Flash

M
Sweetie

She beckons Noelle over Tucks back the little girls hair
Keeping her voice low enough so Ben cant hear

M (CONTD)
This is going to sound really
strange butwhats my name

Noelle only gives her a half-crazy look

NOELLE
Mmmmmmmmmm-Mommy

Noelle smiles M smiles too a little embarrassed
M
Right Exactly

Noelle looks her right in the eye

NOELLE
Hes not coming back But its
gonna be okay He put the pieces
together its like
M
The best of all possible worlds

Noelle taps her nose

BEN
Honey Is it supposed to stick
like this
Sharing a look

M
We should help him

Noelle agrees They head over to assist

We MOVE ACROSS the family as they work on the pancakes
Noelle directing how big the ears on hers should be

We leave them in the middle of a messy kitchen gooey

pancakes anda good life

FADE OUT

THE END

ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

The following scene (Scene 99) is the conversation between S
and G that plays near the end of Part Three The plan is to
shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that

involves both characters -- be it in Part One Two or Three

So well be shooting this scene a lot Well then be
intercutting the best of all these moments to create one
sequence

INT EXT VARIOUS LOCATIONS
s
Its not that hard to make a
universe At first you just
checked in every once in a while
See how the Neanderthals were
doing Move some continents
around But then you got more into
it Starting playing a couple of
characters of your own Kings
Slaves Messiahs Pretty soon
you were playing 247

G
How long have I

s
Youve been gone for four thousand
years Not that time means the
same for us but

G
You came looking for me

Ss
Thats what a girl does

G
Why now

s
We couldnt just storm in on a
fiery chariot Its your universe
We had to play by your rules We
had to make you see how limited and
corrupt your little world was
Dont get me wrong this world is
nice Its cozy But do you
remember where you came from

A few beats while it comes back to him Tears start to build
in his eyes What hes picturing is unspeakably beautiful

G
It was warm And white Like

s
You cant describe it with human
words You cant think it with
human thoughts
(beat)
Thats why you have to come back
Come back with us With me
