SHOT PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD watching CUT TO
NOT LONG AFTER THAT (circa 1992) Bill and Ted excited

wide-eyed - the picture of youthful optimism Being
interviewed by KURT LODER on MTV

KURT LODER
In other music news Claiming they have
been told by “a civilization seven hundred
years in the future” that their music will
“do nothing less than save the world”

Now on MTV we see a PHOTO OF BILL AND TED age 20

KURT LODER (CONTD)
Wyld Stallyns has just put down a hundred
thousand dollars to reserve the famous
“Fabulous Forum” for a date twenty years
from now

CUT TO DISTANT HAND-HELD VIDEO FOOTAGE of the guys handing
a ceremonial 4 foot check to the “FABULOUS FORUM” BOOKING

CUT TO THE BAND VAN HALEN

SAMMY HAGAR

be a pretty big problem

EDDIE VAN HALEN
They never came up with a song

ALEX VAN HALEN
The song let’s say Not to mention the
record Or any record really

CUT TO THE BAND IRON MAIDEN

BRUCE DICKENSON
They got record deals - we know that cuz
they paid us a ton to just basically be
session guys

“NICKO” MCBRAIN
But no matter what we played it was never
good enough

BRUCE DICKINSON
Yeah - cuz like they kept saying to us
“This has to save the world”

QUICK SHOTS

JEFF BECK
“No Jeff - this has to save the world”
JIMMY PAGE
And I remember saying “Guys it’s a
song The Beatles didn’t save the world

Mozart didn’t save the world

ERIC CLAPTON
“Save the world save the world”

Clapton rolls his eyes and makes the “jerk off” motion And
we CUT TO

FOOTAGE FROM “BOGUS JOURNEY” Bill and Ted on stage with
their wives to their side and their babies on their backs--

CUT TO

TED
(same)
And Little Bill

THEIR SONS NOW (INTERVIEWED ON TV)

WILL
Okay like our dads - they were told - in
high school - that their music was gonna
save the world

THEO
I mean that’s a lot of pressure Like if
somebody came to us and told us that our
Music was gonna save the world

WILL
Well that would be pretty okay

THEO
Yeah I’d be good with that

THEIR WIVES now Title “JOANNA PRESTON AND

ELIZABETH LOGAN”

JOANNA
Look the point is they took it seriously
- they take it seriously

ELIZABETH
They really care and they work hard
It’s pretty much all they do actually

JOANNA
But they’ve found ways Certain
whatever ‘hobbies’ you know to cope

CUT TO 1994 POLISH MTV

Not great video quality

POLISH INTERVIEWER (0S)
(Polish accent)
What are you making there Ted

24 YR OLD TED
I never know I just knit till it feels
done

POLISH INTERVIEWER (0S)
It’s very dense what you’re knitting

the guys interviewed on a cheap
set Ted is KNITTING some kind of thick amorphous

shape
24 YR OLD TED
Yah I call em yarn blobs
(then)
Ask Bill what he does to relax

POLISH INTERVIEWER (0S)
What do you do to relax Bill

Ted moves his mouth - but we hear BILL’S VOICE

24 YR OLD BILL’S VOICE COMING FROM TED
I do ventriloquism dude

CUT BACK TO JOANNA AND ELIZABETH

INTERVIEWER (0S)
How do you cope

A beat The women look at each other silence Then

ELIZABETH
Let’s just say things didn’t go the way we
all expected them to go

MORE QUICK SHOTS A BRIEF TIMELINE

1995 25 YR OLD BILL AND TED (with the princesses) rush from
the studio toward SUVs CAMERAS PUSH IN - it’s like John and
Paul leaving Abbey Road with Linda and Yoko in 1968

REPORTER (0S)
Bill Ted When’s the record coming out

25 YR OLD BILL
(a McCartneyesque double-barrelled
finger-pointed thumbs up)
Almost there

25 YR OLD TED
All good things come to those who wait

1996 STILL PHOTOS OF 26 YEAR OLD BILL AND TED BEHIND THE
SCENES AT A RADIO STATION INTERVIEW BEARDED A COUPLE
QUICK PUSH-INS - still upbeat and assured

RICK DEES (0S)
-So - the record What gives How about
right here - right now - you tell us the
definitive release date

26 YEAR OLD TED (0S)
Oh Yeah Can’t do that

26 YEAR OLD BILL (0S)
Just Changing directions a little bit
But it’s all good stuff
CUT TO THE BAND ARCADE FIRE

WIN BUTLER
They lost three record deals in as many
years Cause the thing with record
deals when you get down to it you kind
of have to make a record

REGINE CHASSAGNE
I personally felt sorry for them They
were trying so hard that they were
actually driving people away

QUICK PHOTOS Bill and Ted playing increasingly obscure
instruments and wearing increasingly eccentric clothes
(capes flight suits kilts knickerbockers play
didgeridoo theramin rainsticks harp)

WIN BUTLER (VO)
Or maybe as people were drifting away it
just made them try harder it’s tough to
know

QUICK VIDEO A small venue Bill and Ted wear loin cloths and
sandals and sport long Jesus beards and blow shofars

CUT TO KANYE WEST AND JAY Z

KANYE WEST
It’s like they went from “She Loves You”
to “Revolution Number Nine” in a very
short time without ever doing any of the
songs in between Or even doing “She
Loves You” when you think about it Or
“Revolution Number Nine”

JAY Z
To be honest they kind of just did nothing
But a very lame very pretentious version of
nothing

2000 SMALL OUTDOOR FESTIVAL - HAND HELD FAN VIDEO

Bill - totally nude (except for black combat boots) - does a
lead guitar version of TAPS while he approaches the mic

30 YEAR OLD BILL
Let us now declare the epoch of the
electric guitar officially dead

We now reveal TED behind him also nude (and also in combat
boots) with a chain saw
30 YEAR OLD TED
(to his guitar)
I sacrifice thee obsolescence embodied
For eternity

Now Ted chainsaws off the neck of Bill’s guitar - which
sparks and feeds back

CUT TO THE BAND METALLICA

LARS ULRICH
I think that was that moment The
Riverside Metal Fest Okay - first of
all right off the bat - they were using a
chain saw nude I mean that tells you
something about their judgement right
there

JAMES HETFIELD
I don’t think we heard another thing from
them til Hunh I don’t even know

STILL PHOTO

MARQUEE OUTSIDE A DIVE BAR “Ponderosa Lounge - 8PM The Wild
Stallions - and half-priced Buffalo chicken wings” PUSH IN

LARS ULRICH (VO)
Are they even still making music I mean
what are they even doing now

THROUGH THE WINDOW we see a grainy image of Bill and Ted on
stage we FREEZE then PULL BACK as the image becomes a

HOLOGRAM and we begin to realize we are

INT FUTURISTIC DOME - CONTINUOUS

Where the THREE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE WORLD float in
mid-air gravely looking at the image before them

Super San Dimas California 2713

They turn to a FOURTH MAN - very severe almost puritanical
looking dressed in all black (ROLLINS)

LEADER
Their time is running out We must take
emergency measures The future of
everything hangs in the balance

On Rollins’ face a slight flash of concern - and surprise
He steps into a SLEEK SILVER METALLIC BOOTH dons his
SUNGLASSES And with a nod to the Great Ones
The booth shimmers drops through the floor
Cut to BLACK
Title up BILL AND TED FACE THE MUSIC

Then fade up on

EXT WEDDING - DAY

Bill and Ted in their mid-40’s in suits walk up to a
microphone

Behind them a banner reads “CONGRATULATIONS DEACON AND
MISSY” We are at a wedding Garden-variety middle class

Joanna and Elizabeth are there (also in their mid 40s)
Elizabeth is with WILL Joanna is with THEO (also 18)

The guys are buoyant exuberant-- utterly unflappable

TED
Good afternoon And welcome to this
joyous occasion

BILL
Ted and I have both known Missy in
different capacities for nearly 40 years

TED
She was Bill’s babysitter when we were
ten and we both invited her to the prom
when she was a senior and we were

freshman

BILL
Next she married my dad and Missy became
“Mom”

TED

After quickly divorcing Bill’s dad Missy
married my dad and became my mom

Ted’s dad POLICE CHIEF CHET LOGAN now in his mid 60’s and
still very fit raises his glass with a tight smile that only
barely masks his bitterness

BILL
And now she is marrying Ted’s younger
brother Officer Deacon Logan

We see DEACON now 40 buzz cut with MISSY now late 40’s
He raises his glass
TED
Deacon - my congratulations Missy - Bill
and I - along with Joanna and Elizabeth
and Will and Theo - welcome you back with
open arms

Elizabeth Joanna Will and Theo all raise glasses

BILL
This joyous event would seem to make
Deacon his own father-in-law and make Ted
his own uncle

TED
Not to mention making my dad his own son

In back Logan just shakes his head irked on so many levels

BILL
So with that beautiful thought in mind
for your first dance we wish to present a
sneak peek at the world premiere of our
newest sonic creation

TED
So please enjoy the first three movements
of

BILLTED

“That Which Binds Us Through Time The
Chemical Physical and Biological Nature
of Love An Exploration of the Meaning of
Meaning”

TED
Ready Bill

BILL
Ready Ted One

TED
Two

BILL
One two three four

Ted plays bagpipes Bill is engaged in a kind of wide-
mouthed Aboriginal ‘throat-singing’ While clearly a great
deal of thought (and even love) has gone into the preparation
of this piece it is at its core quite difficult to define
and in fact impossible to enjoy

Wedding guests watch with jaw-dropped befuddlement as -

Deacon and Missy step to the dance floor - aware that this is
somehow their “first dance” But it’s hard for them to
decipher how exactly they’re supposed to move to this

Joanna and Elizabeth exchange a glance As do Will and Theo
Teds dad just openly throws his hands up

CHIEF LOGAN
This is bullshit

and crosses to a power bank and literally pulls the plug on
the whole thing CUT TO

THIRTY SECONDS LATER
Ted and his dad off to the side of the stage

TED
I’m sorry you don’t get it Dad

CHIEF LOGAN
No one gets it Ted No one ever has
There’s nothing to get

TED
They will Dad seriously

CHIEF LOGAN
I don’t think so That song is the worst
one yet And that’s saying a lot I told
Deacon he should never have let you guys
play I’m sorry “play” And honestly -
on a very deep level - it is time to pull
the plug Both of you

TED
We can’t We have to pursue this until --

CHIEF LOGAN
Yeah yeah yeah I know until your “music
saves the world” Ted Enough with your
delusions

While this continues we CUT AWAY TO

THE VAN

Where Bill wheels equipment to the back door He pulls it
open and sees - his FATHER BOB PRESTON slumped in the back
having just been awakened

BILL
Hey dad

MR PRESTON
How was the wedding

BILL
It was good You shoulda come in

MR PRESTON
Weddings are hard for me Billy My
social worker says I’ve never really
recovered from your mom leaving all those
years ago Your real mom not Missy

BILL
I know That was hard

Mr Preston gives Bill a huge hug

MR PRESTON
I love you Billy

BILL
I know Dad And I love you too
(as his dad continues to hug him)
Okay Dad It’s totally fine Everything’s
good Dad Everything’s gonna be okay I
really gotta go get some more stuff

He breaks off turns And we follow him to --
TED AND LOGAN
Still in the thick of it

TED
Dad - I’m just saying if you’d done the
things me and Bill have done and seen the
things we’ve seen --

CHIEF LOGAN
No - you can keep “spinning” this however
you want Ted but I’1ll never believe it
You didn’t time travel You didn’t die
and go to hell and then come back

BILL
Chief Logan - we did -

CHIEF LOGAN
No You didn’t Bill And here’s the
reason you didn’t it’s impossible

TED
Dad - I know you’re upset because Deacon
just married --

CHIEF LOGAN
No Ted - you’re wrong It has nothing
to do with that Trust me if I’m more
disappointed in one of my sons it’s you

Logan spins to storm away Then turns back

CHIEF LOGAN (CONTD)
By the way That five thousand dollars I
loaned you I want it back

TED
You’1l get it back

CHIEF LOGAN
When Ted You’re upside down on your
mortgage You’re fifty thousand dollars
in debt Your wife is working two jobs so
you two can pursue your pathetic fantasy
Get real Ted Get real - both of you

And he’s off Ted just stands there Bill puts his hand on
Ted’s shoulder

BILL
Dude - if it’s any consolation I’m eighty-
thousand dollars in debt

TED
What are we gonna do

MANS VOICE (PRELAP)
No No no no
INT FABULOUS FORUM - DAY

Keys and coat in hand the stadium manager (FRANK) closes his
office door as Bill and Ted follow him out into the arena

FRANK
No you may not have your non-refundable
deposit back

TED
But --
FRANK
No ‘buts’ Twenty years ago you signed a

contract - put down a deposit - to rent
the Forum tomorrow night for your concert
celebrating “Two Decades of Greatness--”

BILL
Triumphance
Ted leans

FRANK
Whatever I tell you this every year--

BILL
But this year is different

TED
It’s quite different - as you will see if
youd simply listen to us

FRANK
Fine Go ahead

TED
This year given the direness of our
financial situation we’re willing to
reduce our offer from a one hundred
percent refund to an eighty percent
refund

FRANK
So wait - I’m sorry - then I’d only have
to give you eighty thousand dollars that I
contractually do not owe you rather than a
hundred thousand

BILL
Correct But between us our bottom line
is sixty thousand for which we will take
forty

TED
But no lower than twenty-five

BILL
Of which we would accept ten

to Bill

TED
Dude - I have a sneaking feeling that
we’re negotiating against ourselves

BILL
Good point Ted
(turns)
Forget everything we said We’re back at
a hundred thousand Plus interest

FRANK
Okay then I guess I should make my
counter offer nothing The point is
you bought the Forum tomorrow night - it’s
yours Do whatever you want with it -
throw a party at mid-field I don’t care
The lights’1l be on the gate’1ll be open

(MORE)

FRANK (CONTD)
By the way - just out of curiosity - how
many tickets have you guys sold

BILL
Well it’s hard to say - it could have
changed cause we haven’t checked the web
site in a while

FRANK
That’s fine Just give me the ballpark
number

TED

Okay - ballpark I’m just estimating
here but approximately zero

Frank shakes his head
FRANK
I have to tell you guys - what you have
pulled off here is very impressive ina
way You’ve promoted a concert for twenty
years and sold zero tickets

BILL
Thanks dude

FRANK
It’s not a compliment
INT ELEVATOR - DAY

Bill and Joanna ride up in silence They get off and enter

INT WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

And Joanna stops as she sees Elizabeth and Ted also in the
waiting room Elizabeth is equally surprised Ted is not

TED
How’s it goin’ dude Hey Jo

JOANNA
I’m sorry - is this the right day

BILL
Yah Totally Couples therapy

JOANNA
But

Now the other door opens and the THERAPIST sticks his head
out - a bit surprised to see TWO couples in his waiting room

INT THERAPISTS OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

Bill with Joanna and Ted with Elizabeth sit across from
the Therapist It’s a little crowded on the couch

THERAPIST
So do you understand why this situation
might seem at all strange to your wives

TED
No not at all Why

THERAPIST
Well when your wives suggested couples
therapy did you think this is what they
had in mind

BILL
Yah Definitely I mean we’re a couple
of couples right

THERAPIST

Well it usually means one couple
BILLTED

Ohhh
THERAPIST

But since you’re here - let me ask you
this Is there something you feel your
wives need to hear from you

TED
Yah Totally
(turning to Elizabeth)
We love you guys

THERAPIST
Okay that’s good But Do you
understand how that might sound strange to
your wives Bill

BILL
No We love em
THERAPIST
“We” love them
BILL
Yah we do
THERAPIST
“We do
TED

Yah we do Exactly

THERAPIST
It’s the “we” part Ted Can you say
the same thing using “I” in the sentence

TED
Ohhh Yah of course
(turns to Elizabeth)
Elizabeth I - and Bill - love you - and
Joanna

Elizabeth just stares at the floor shakes her head
BILL
Dude All due respect - I don’t think
youre getting this

TED
Go for it dude

BILL
Okay
(turns)
Joanna From the very very bottom of I -
and Ted’s - hearts I - and Ted - totally
love and worship you - and Elizabeth

Bill beams Ted nods - as if he now sees

THERAPIST
Joanna would you or Elizabeth like to
respond

Elizabeth indicates “go ahead”

JOANNA
Well Okay I know you love me Bill
However - and I can’t speak for Elizabeth
but you guys are gone over two hundred
nights a year Every time you go out on tour
to make money you come back deeper in debt

BILL
But we have to --

JOANNA
I know I know it’s a burden for you And
I know you feel as though you have to do
it yourselves But you don’t We
literally left everything behind our
families our friends

ELIZABETH
We moved 600 years in the future to be
with you To be your partners But it’s
like all you think about is the song

JOANNA
The mission

ELIZABETH
And it’s like we and the boys are not even
there

TED
So Wait What are you saying

ELIZABETH
I guess what I’m saying is If things
don’t change I don’t know how much
longer I can go on like this

Ted is stunned He looks at Bill Bill turns to Joanna

BILL
Do you feel the same way

Joanna nods

INT DODGE NEON - DRIVING

Ted and Elizabeth in tense silence Ted glances over - she
just stares straight ahead They pull up to the end of --

EXT CUL DE SAC - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Where TWO HOUSES share a driveway at the end of a quiet
middle-class street As they pull in --

A GEO METRO is already there and Bill and Joanna are getting
out - also with palpable tension between them

(What is clear to us now is they all live right next door
to each other and share a driveway - and garage)

As the women head towards the Logan house Bill and Ted join
each other

TED
Dude - things are worse than I thought I
think they’re actually thinking about
leaving us

BILL
I know it’s bad But we still got our
work to do

They look at their wives who are conferring at the front
door

TED
Okay - let’s just try and work sorta fast

BILL
Yah Totally

As they start toward the GARAGE-- suddenly we HEAR the sound
of GUITARS from within Ted exhales heavily

TED
I’ve told Will over and over

They pull the garage door open revealing

INT GARAGE - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Will and Theo are playing classic old guitars (the very ones
that Bill and Ted played at the end of “Bogus Journey”)

They immediately stop look at their fathers

WILL
How’s it goin dad

TED
Out
THEO
What
TED
This is our studio - and those are our
guitars

He and Bill pull the guitars from their sons’ hands

BILL
We have important work to do and we can’t
have you messing around in here

WILL
You wanna at least see what we’ve been
working on

Will holds a piece of paper out Ted takes it shoves it in
his pocket

TED
Later But right now we need the studio
(a beat)

Now please Will

WILL
Okay Grampa

The boys shake their heads

THEO
I told you dude It’s always the same
Let’s just go play up in my room With
our crappy guitars

Will nods and the boys head out Bill and Ted watch them go
guilty as Ted shuts the garage door and we cut to

INT GARAGEMUSIC STUDIO - NIGHT

Bill and Ted are working on a song struggling Bill is
noodling on the synthesizer - Ted is scratching out lyrics

TED
Okay I added a couple things Go again

Bill starts on the synthesizer it’s abstruse complex (not
in a good way) - like D-grade Bohemian Rhapsody

TED (CONTD)
“We try - y - y - y to carry--yy on
Ayiii-eee-ee-ee-ee a-000-00-00-00”

Ted stops Bill picks it up

BILL
“OoEEEE-eeee-YIYIYIYI”
(to Ted)
Dude - run with me I think we’re onto
something
(resuming)

“We straaa-aaaa-aaa-aaa-aainyiyi-yi-yi--

”

TED
Dude - seriously Stop I hate to say
this but we’re NOT onto anything

BILL
What are you talking about I think it’s
our best one yet

TED
Dude - if that’s true - then things are
even worse than I thought Cause this
song sucks You do know that right

BILL
I don’t agree

TED
Dude

BILL

TED
Bill - come on It’s me You don’t have
to spin me It sucks All our songs
suck What are we doing Seriously Our
wives are mad at us our sons are mad at
us we’re broke-- why are we even doing
this

BILL
We’re doing it cause we have to Ted -
we’re supposed to save all humanity

TED
Says who

BILL
Those people - from the future --

TED
What if they were wrong

BILL
How could they be wrong We saw the
future - we were there

TED
Alls I know is at this moment I feel
like for the last 20 years weve been
beating our heads against a wall and it
hurts and I wanna stop

BILL
But we can’t We promised

TED
Who’s gonna care Seriously I’m sick of
it And you know you are too

Bill just looks at Ted - for a long moment - and then he just
deflates dropping the facade

BILL
Okay Yah I’m totally sick of it But
I thought if I ever admitted it - to you
or me - we’d completely crumble

There’s a pause

TED
I can’t do this any more I just can’t

Another pause Finally Bill looks at Ted And nods
agreeing Then suddenly there’s --

A FLASH of LIGHT outside visible under the garage door

Then We HEAR a metallic WHOOSH Then FOOTSTEPS Someone
Or something is outside

Bill and Ted look at each other walk toward the garage door
and slowly open it revealing--

The futuristic BOOTH

BILLTED
Whoa

And next to the booth emerging from its shadow ROLLINS

BILL
Who are you

ROLLINS
Come with me please

BILL
Are you from the future

ROLLINS

Yes
A beat The guys look at each other again

TED
Are you mad at us

ROLLINS
We have very little time

He opens the door for them Ted leans closer to Bill

TED
I think we’re in trouble

BILL
Relax Ted They totally love us in the
future
The guys get into the sleek elegant booth Rollins closes
the door and in an instant It shimmers and DISAPPEARS
INT CIRCUITS OF TIME

Dark Misty Glimpses of light We hear a WHOOOSH and the
silver booth soars past in blur

INT BOOTH - ON BILL AND TED

Bill and Ted - stunned amazed - gape out at the circuits of
time for the first time in a long time And we cut to
INT GREAT DOME - THE YEAR 2712 - DAY

The booth appears and touches down on the floor Rollins
gets out followed by Bill and Ted Bill and Ted whisper

TED
Dude
BILL
What
TED
I think I liked Rufus better
BILL

Me too
(turns to Rollins)
What is it you do here dude

ROLLINS
I clean up messes

The guys look at each other as they hear

BOOMING VOICE
Bill and Ted Step closer please

Now they turn and see

THREE IMPOSING FIGURES-- who look at Bill and Ted with barely
restrained urgency and frustration

They are fierce unblinking It’s dark and intense Bill
and Ted look at each other swallow

Around the room is a kind of “Senate” of observers who line
the walls Bill adopts an upbeat manner

BILL
How’s it goin’ Good to be back again
Lookin’ great

LEADER
What do you have to say for yourselves

TED
Oh

They look at each other then adopt their arm-raised posture

BILL
Be excellent to each other

TED
And party on dudes

Dead silence No smiles No nods Nothing but scowls

LEADER
Where’s the song

The guys eyes widen

TED
Oh The song

BILL
Which one We’ve written so many

LEADER
The song The song that will fulfill your
destiny The one that is to be played at
the Fabulous Forum tomorrow night The
one that will save the world as we know
it

BILL
Oh yah That song We definitely have
that song Yah

The Leader makes a gesture Lights come up and suddenly all
around them are MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS of all shapes and sizes

LEADER
Then play it

TED
Like right now

LEADER
We need to hear it

TED
Um Before we do that --

BILL
Which we very much look forward to doing --

TED
And are most eminently prepared to do --

BILL
Being as it’s already written --
A pause

TED
And is very good on the level of lyrics
and melody and rhythmic aspects as well
as meter and you know thematic content
we need to

BILL
Tweak

TED
Yah Tweak

BILL
Or even better perhaps what would
expedite this entire process

TED
Would be if you played the song for us
right now

BILL
Or perhaps played it several times

TED
Or even just give us a recording So we
may be certain we have the exact rendition
of our greatest song ever written

LEADER
You don’t have it

BILL
What No Just the opposite

TED
In fact our problem is we have so many
great songs that as we put together our
set list for the concert tomorrow night --

BILL
The one we in no way bailed on years ago --

TED
And which as recently as an hour ago did
not try to get our money back from -

BILL
Right that did not happen

TED
You’re not watching us all the time are
you

Silence Then the Leader just waves his arms and THE
FLOATING GREAT FIGURES DISAPPEAR INTO DARKNESS -- as do the
instruments and instantly--

Rollins is standing right in front of the guys

ROLLINS
The window of destiny is closing You
have twenty four hours to come up with the
song

TED
But-- What if for some reason we don’t

BILL
Which would be most paradoxical because
obviously we do already have it

TED
But you know just theoretically cause
we are intrigued with all manner of
thought experiment involving you know
“the conundrum of time”

BILL
So-- What would happen

Rollins looks at them

ROLLINS
Come with me

He turns The guys look at each other then follow him as
two huge doors slide open and they all enter --

A CATHEDRAL-LIKE CHAMBER

Built solely to house

A HOLOGRAPHIC TIME-LINE

Ethereal majestic floating in mid-air Weaving and winding
from the deepest past all the way to the present - and

still moment by moment continuing to inch forward

BILLTED
Whoa

TED
What is this

ROLLINS
This is time It’s the path through which
the past connects with the present and
leads to the future

The guys move closer Now they can see that the “weave” is
actually a collection of INFINITESIMALLY SMALL BITS OF
INFORMATION

Rollins reaches out and TOUCHES a section in the way one
might touch say an iPad As he does

ROLLINS (CONTD)

an IMAGE FROM 1945 balloons out Hiroshima He removes
his finger - the image recedes He touches another spot

ROLLINS (CONTD)

-and out balloons an image of the Man standing in front of
the tank in Tiananmen Square

ROLLINS (CONTD)
Time is more fluid and more contingent
than you understand There are key
moments in the weave - turning points -
like stitches if you want to think of
them that way And when one is missing
then everything can fray

TED
Has that ever happened
ROLLINS
It’s about to happen
BILL
Meaning
ROLLINS

If you don’t have the song in 24 hours
time as we all know it will essentially
unravel Forward and backward

TED
Oh
EXT CUL DE SAC - HOUSE - NIGHT
The booth appears The guys get out still in shock

Rollins gives Ted a TIMEPIECE of some sort like a really
cool sleek WATCH

ROLLINS
Keep a close eye on this You have 24
hours When it runs out it’s over

Rollins crosses back to his booth and gets in And with a
nod at them he’s gone

BILL
Okay - bad news the whole unraveling of
time thing could be most heinous Good news
This means there is a song Otherwise they
wouldn’t be so mad at us for not having it

TED
--Yah I think that’s probably right

BILL
So now alls we gotta do is stop writing
songs that totally suck and just write
the greatest song ever written Okay

TED
--Yah I guess

Bill starts into the garage Ted remains on the curb

BILL
Ted what are you doing dude We gotta
keep going

TED
I just don’t get it I mean-- We’ve been
trying for 20 years to write the greatest
song ever written How are we gonna do it
in 24 hours

BILL
I don’t know But we gotta
(beat)
I mean Right What else are we gonna
do dude

Ted nods - distant and distracted

TED
But we do know the song’s gonna exist
right

BILL

Well yah at some point

TED
I just wish there was a way that we could
go into the future and get it from
ourselves

BILL
How would we do that

There’s a pause They look at each other sharing a slowly
dawning realization

BILL (CONTD)
Could we actually

TED
Couldn’t we

BILL
But-- didn’t Rufus say we could only do
that in an extreme emergency

TED
Bill-- if the future of all of reality as
we know it is at stake isn’t that an
extreme emergency

EXT BILL’S HOUSE - NIGHT - MOMENT LATER

The guys head towards a STORAGE SHED at the very back of the
property

At the shed they undo a series of heavy metal padlocks

The door opens a single light bulb is switched on

INT SHED - CONTINUOUS

The guys walk to the darkest most shadowy corner and start
to pull a series of covers sheets tarps etc off of what
gradually reveals itself as

THE PHONE BOOTH The old one from the earlier movies
It’s dusty rusted obviously hasn’t been used in 20 years

BILL
Okay so here’s the plan We go into the
future to when we’ve actually written the
song find ourselves and take it

TED
One question Is that stealing

BILL
Why would it be stealing if we’re getting
it from ourselves

TED
Oh yah
(eyeing the booth)
You think it still works

BILL
Only one way to find out dude

INT PHONE BOOTH - SECONDS LATER
They get in Dust off the key pad

TED
How far into the future do you think we
need to go

BILL
Depends on when we think we’re gonna write
the song

TED
I say definitely within the next year or
two

BILL
Well let’s be conservative Say five
years

TED
Sounds good
(a pause)
You wanna do the honors or should I

BILL
Go for it dude

Ted - with not a little bit of nostalgia and a good deal of
trepidation starts to hit the buttons

TED
San Dimas California Five years from
now

At first nothing happens It’s like starting a car that’s
been sitting in the garage for 20 years Then-- the lights
in the booth flicker on there is a low hummingbuzzing
sound As the antenna comes to life illuminating the dark
shed the guys look at each other

TED (CONTD)
Bill

BILL
What

TED
I have a feeling things are just about to
change in a most outstanding way

BILL
Ted I totally agree

And with an exuberant super-optimistic AIR GUITAR

TED
Let’s go save the world dude

the booth shimmers and DISAPPEARS and we cut to

INT CIRCUITS OF TIME - CONTINUOUS

Whhhoooshhhhhh The booth sails through the circuits of time -
which are sleeker faster than when last we sailed through

The guys look through the glass - thrilled moved neither
thought he’d ever be doing this again

TED
Whoa

BILL
I know

The booth veers off disappears into a circuit and we cut to

EXT HOLIDAY INN - SAN DIMAS

On the marquee “OPEN MIC NIGHT” We hear a faint version

of Huey Lewis’ “The Heart of Rockn Roll” coming from inside -
a sad version - kind of pathetic earnest and overly sincere
Super San Dimas California - five years into the future

The booth APPEARS lands in the parking lot The guys step
out look around - hear the music from within

INT HOLIDAY INN - LOBBY - A MOMENT LATER

They enter the lobby

TED
So where are the future us’s

BILL
Yah - you’d think wed be waiting for
ourselves

TED

We gotta remember to be more polite and

come out and greet ourselves next time
(notices something)

Oh no

Bill turns - follows Ted’s gaze into --

THE LOUNGE
Where ON STAGE - in front of a dozen bored businessmen - are
50 YR OLD BILL AND TED

In black vests white shirts earrings - singing “Heart of
Rock’n Roll” 50 Yr Old Bill is working a little harder to
push it across 50 Yr Old Ted just seems depressed

(And the years have not been kind to their voices Ted’s has
gotten lower - and is now a rumbly Kris Kristofferson croak
Bill’s is now a kind of high nasally Art Garfunkel whine)

50 YR OLD BILLTED
T-T-T-THEY SAY THE HEAR OF ROCK’N ROLL IS
STILL BEATIN’ AND FROM WHAT I’VE SEEN I
BELIEVE ‘EM NOW THE OLD BOY MAY BE BARELY
BREATHIN’ BUT THE HEART OF ROCK’N ROLL
(a sort of harmony)
THE HEART OF ROCK’N ROLL IS STILL BEATIN’

In the back Bill and Ted enter shocked

BILLTED
No way

They say it just loud enough that on stage 50 Yr Old Bill
hears them - and looks up Which makes 50 Yr Old Ted do the
same thing Now like deer in headlights

50 Yr Old Bill and Ted freeze If the audience were paying
attention they’d notice the two sets of Bills and Teds all
standing motionless staring at each other but no one cares
There’s an odd moment where they all stand staring Then

50 Year Old Bill and Ted turn and bolt through the back exit

Bill and Ted look at each other - and sprint across the room

EXT BACK OF HOLIDAY INN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

50 Year Old Bill and Ted scramble in their dress shoes across
the parking lot and race toward the (now quite beaten up) van
with their guitars A beat later -

BILL
Wait Bill

TED
Ted

They race to the van where 50 Yr Old Bill and Ted are
opening the doors

TED (CONT’D)
Hey - us’s Stop

Older Bill and Ted turn - busted Instantly (and lamely)
they try and cover

50 YR OLD BILL
Ohhh Hello

50 YR OLD TED
We totally forgot you guys were coming
How great to see you

BILL
What are you talking about You totally
ran away from us

50 YR OLD BILL
Oh - that’s just because in the
darkness we thought you were groupies
which we have a lot of

Bill and Ted look around the deserted back parking lot

TED
Really

50 YR OLD TED
Oh yah - absolutely

50 Year Old Ted nervously pulls a flask from his hip pocket
and takes a swig

50 YR OLD BILL
Look - dudes - we know exactly what you’re
thinking why are we playing here at open
mic night at the Holiday Inn in San Dimas
when in fact we are such huge rock stars
with lots of groupies

50 YR OLD TED
And here’s the answer Us being here is
humorously ironic

50 YR OLD BILL
Do you believe us

50 YR OLD TED
I remember not necessarily believing it when
I you was standing there listening to I me

50 YR OLD BILL
But this time you really can believe us
(pause)
Do you believe us

TED
No

BILL
Not at all

50 Year Old Ted takes another (this time bigger) gulp from
his flask As he wipes his mouth with his sleeve

50 YR OLD TED
(vaguely belligerent)
Well I feel sorry for you then

BILL
Do you have the song

50 YR OLD BILL
Bo we have the song Do we have the song

BILL
Yes Do you

TED
Ted Stop drinking for a minute and look
me in the eye Do you have the song

50 Yr Old Ted almost looks Ted in the eye at his eyebrows
between his eyes But not in the eye

TED (CONT’D)
No In the eye Look me in the eye Ted
and tell me you have the song Otherwise
were gonna leave right now Do you have
the song or do you not

(beat shakes his head sadly)
You totally don’t have the song do you

50 YR OLD TED
(finishing his entire flask)
You know what Screw you me

BILL50 YR OLD BILL
Whoa whoaEasy Ted -

50 YR OLD TED
No - not easy
(to Bill and Ted)
YOU didn’t write the song YOU’RE the
ones who’re responsible for all of this
And you know something else pretty boy
TED
Don’t call me that

50 YR OLD TED
“Don’t call me that” “Dude” You drove
the princesses away

BILL
Whoa Wait What did you say The
princesses are gone

50 YR OLD BILL
Oh don’t act so surprised They basically
told you they were gonna leave Well guess
what As soon as you got back from this
stupid failed mission - they were gone

TED
What

BILL
How

50 YR OLD TED
No idea Alls we know is they left a note
saying they took Will and Theo back to
1428 and they never came back - and now
weve been alone for five years cause you
drove our wives away

TED
Our wives have been gone for five years
and you haven’t even tried to talk to
them

50 YR OLD BILL
Oh - you did alright - you just made it
worse They had their doubts about you
which you were totally missing I might
add and then you went back to Medieval
England and confirmed every one of em

BILL
There is no way we did that

50 YR OLD TED
Yah well you’re gonna eat your words in
about 45 seconds

BILL
Not true Ted - let’s go talk to our
wives right now and set this straight

50 YR OLD TED
Fine I’m done with you two losers

Ted lunges for himself Grabs himself --

TED
Why don’t you take some responsibility
you drunk

50 YR OLD TED
Why don’t you go knit a blob

TED
Hey

50 YR OLD TED
Blob-knitter

TED
You’re rude Get your act together Ted

50 YR OLD TED
You get your act together Ted

The two Bills grab the two Teds - who are inches from
throttling each other - and pull them apart

BILL
Ted - back away - he’s not worth it

50 YEAR OLD BILL
He’s right Don’t let that punk get to
you
50 Year Old Ted backs down Bill turns Ted around
BILL
Let’s go clean up the mess those us’s

made

As Older Bill and Ted open the van doors Bill and Ted see
BILLS FATHER in back in a sleeping bag

MR PRESTON
Hi boys How was the gig

Bill stops - eyes wide Turns to his older self

BILL
You live with Dad in the van

TED
(takes Bill’s shoulder)
Walk away dude Walk away

As Bill and Ted make their way across the lot

50 YEAR OLD TED
If you don’t like it - go fix it

50 YR OLD BILL
Yah Go write the song yourself instead
of trying to steal it from us

50 YR OLD TED
Or do something-- cuz our lives suck and
it’s your fault
EXT HOLIDAY INN PARKING LOT - A MOMENT LATER

The guys approach - and get into - the booth

BILL
Those older us’s were jerks

TED
I know I can’t believe how much I hated
my me

BILL

I know But we did learn something quite
important from them We gotta go back to
England

TED
Yah What’s the point of any of this is we
don’t got our families

The phone booth starts to shimmer - the guys turn prepare
for it to drop And just as it starts to -

Bill and Ted’s eyes widen as they think they see - about 50
feet away across the parking lot

ROLLINS in his silver booth eyeing them as if studying them

But before Bill and Ted have a chance to react (or even be
sure what they’ve seen) their booth drops and we cut to

EXT MEDIEVAL CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

Joanna and Elizabeth - in 1428 attire - are at a table in the
courtyard chatting with family and friends Will and Theo -
in modern attire - are also there chatting amiably with

their grandparents the Duke and Duchess of North Umberland

WILL
--graduated in June now we’re just
working on the music

DUKE
And what kind of music is that
There’s a

THEO
It’s a blend of classic old guitar with
techno Kinda neo-bluesy but actually
without any place to plug in it’s gonna
be a little hard to keep playing

DUCHESS
“Plug in” to what

WILL
That’s a little complicated Grandma

flash in the distance and--

EXT MEDIEVAL ENGLAND - DAY

The booth

lands in a field and the guys get out look over

toward the castle and see

Joanna and Elizabeth - on horseback - riding toward them

The wives

BILL
Whatever we do let’s not give those other
us’s the satisfaction of making things
worse

TED
Don’t worry We definitely won’t

arrive and dismount

JOANNA
What are you two doing here We need some
time away

TED
Right And we totally respect that But
first how did you get here

ELIZABETH
That nice man from the future showed up
and asked if we needed anything And we
told him we would very much like to come
home for a while

JOANNA
So he brought us here

Bill and Ted exchange a glance “Why would he do that” Ted
turns to Elizabeth

TED
Okay We know you’re thinking very
seriously of leaving us

ELIZABETH
What No we’re not

BILL
Yes you are - you just don’t realize it
yet you think you’re just here for a
visit but you’re totally gonna stay

Off the women’s confused looks

TED
Full disclosure we just saw ourselves
five years in the future - and you have
every reason to leave us because the truth
is we’re going to become everything you
don’t want us to be

BILL
Were just sad pathetic losers living in
the van with my dad--

TED
Drinking too much --

BILL
And lying You cant believe what oily
liars we are

TED
And - get this we tried to tell
ourselves not to come here Like we were
somehow going to make it worse

BILL
Which is ridiculous - cause knowing what
we know we’re only making it better
right

ELIZABETH
Wait - what are you talking about In
five years you’re living in a van - with
your dad - drinking too much

The guys realize they might actually be making things worse
The women are starting to eye them differently worried now
in a way they weren’t before

TED
Exactly Which is why we’re trying to
change that by finding the song

BILL
Because if we don’t find it it’s gonna be
a lot worse than even that

TED
Yah like all of reality will completely
unravel

BILL
But don’t worry about that cuz apparently
the future is fluid

TED
Exactly You can change it if you do the
right things at the right times

BILL
Like coming here and talking to you now

ELIZABETH
I’m not entirely sure it was the right
thing to do

JOANNA
Yes maybe those future you’s were a
little bit right

ELIZABETH
Why were you drinking so much Ted

TED
I havent started yet - I can’t answer
that

ELIZABETH
Maybe we do need a little more time than
we thought

TED
What No Elizabeth I’1ll go to AA

ELIZABETH
But you don’t even drink

TED
Yet But I’m about to

JOANNA
I think we’d like you to leave now

BILL
And you don’t want to come with us

JOANNA
Are you paying any attention

TED
Fine We’re gonna go But you need to
understand We’re gonna keep going till
we succeed on our mission

BILL
Yah we’re gonna find the song We’re
gonna save the world
TED
And were gonna be together
INT BOOTH - A SECOND LATER
Bill’s at the keypad as a determined Ted closes the door
TED
Five years forward was clearly not enough
Let’s go ten this time We certainly will
have written the song by then
BILL
Dude I strongly believe we’re about to
see our lives get a whole lot better

INT BOOTH - CIRCUITS OF TIME

The booth roars past

EXT FOOTHILLS - NIGHT

With a flash the booth arrives in a very nice hilly section
of town City lights lay out The “Bel Air” of San Dimas

Super San Dimas California - 10 years in the future
Bill and Ted step out of the booth and immediately see
AN OLD FASHIONED BRITISH BUTLER
Standing calmly towel over arm
BUTLER
Masters Logan and Preston Welcome home

gentlemen

The Butler opens a gate and leads the amazed guys into

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOME IMAGINABLE

Six car garage gardens fountains huge view In the
driveway a Bentley a Range Rover a Porsche a 65 Mustang

BILL
Dude We did it Look at where we live

TED
Yah - and look at what we’re driving One
song did all this

BILL
Ted - what if it wasn’t just one song
What if after we wrote it the dam broke
and they just kept coming and coming

Subtle air guitar as the Butler ceremoniously opens the door
BUTLER
The masters of the house are on the way
down Might I offer you a spot of
champagne

He extends a tray with four flutes of champagne The guys
take two then hear casual laughter and see

COMING DOWN THE GRAND OPULENT STAIRCASE

55 YR OLD BILL AND TED wearing expensive clothes and
jewelry Whereas 55 Yr Old Bill’s clothes are loose
flowing 55 Yr Old Ted’s are tighter more form-fitting

Bill’s hair is long and flowing Ted’s is “casually unkempt”

55 YR OLD TED
Why hello younger us’s

55 YR OLD BILL
Quel plaiser a vous voir

BILL
Dude - I speak French

55 YR OLD BILL
Oui monsieur

BILL
Excellent

55 YR OLD BILL
I think you mean Excellente

55 Yr Old Bill and Ted raise their champagne flutes

55 YR OLD TED
To your futures

TED
So then I guess you have the song

55 YR OLD TED
Why would we be living like this if we
didnt

TED
And the princesses

55 YR OLD BILL
Brace yourselves Are you ready

55 YR OLD TED
Theyre back
(as Bill and Ted audibly exhale)
They’ve been back for a while And things
are better than ever

Huge loads are lifted from Bill and Ted’s shoulders

TED
Oh that’s such a relief

55 YR OLD TED
(a hand on Ted’s shoulder)
I know you feel that way Ted And it’s
all gonna be good

TED
Really

55 YR OLD TED
Really

55 YR OLD BILL
And - do you know why that happened
Because a certain chanson changed the
lives of two gentlemen named Bill and
Ted

55 YR OLD TED
But enough prologue We know the time is
slipping by on that crazy clock of yours
This way

55 Year Old Bill and Ted lead the guys past a SUNKEN LIVING
ROOM where they hear

MR PRESTON’S VOICE
Salutations boys

BILL
Dad

BILL’S FATHER sits on the sofa dressed in a pashmina caftan
He raises his own champagne flute - and a small silver tray

MR PRESTON
Caviar

55 YEAR OLD BILL
In a moment dad - we’re gonna play em the
song first

MR PRESTON
Youre in for a treat boys Enjoy

MOVING DOWN A LONG HALLWAY

Bill and Ted follow 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted down a hallway
lined with POSTERS GOLD RECORDS MAGAZINE COVERS -- all with
Bill and Ted on the cover We see “BILLBOARD NUMBER ONE
SONG 131 WEEKS IN A ROW”

BILLTED
Whoa

55 YR OLD TED
(to 55 Yr Old Bill)
Remember that

55 YR OLD BILL

Like it was yesterday And I remember me
saying --
55 YR OLD BILL (CONT’D) BILL
Whoa Ted Check out the Whoa Ted Check out the
cover of Rolling Stone dude cover of Rolling Stone dude

Bill points to a cover that says “Q CAN A SONG CHANGE THE
WORLD A TOTALLY”

55 YR OLD TED
And I remember the feeling I had when we
us’s showed you us’s into our somewhat
nice recording studio

They open a double-door and Bill and Ted follow them into --

A SPECTACULAR MUSIC STUDIO

Beyond state of the art Instruments everywhere Clearly a
lot of great music has been - and is being - made here

BILLTED
No way

55 YR OLD BILL55 YR OLD TED
Yes way Bill and Ted

TED
So it worked Our plan worked

55 YR OLD BILL
Of course it worked You guys totally took
the song - the one we’re about to play for
you - played it at the Forum - the girls
were there - and it changed everything

BILL
Wait - we’re gonna play that concert

TED
We haven’t even sold one ticket

55 YEAR OLD TED
Remember reality is fluid

BILL
But what about the guys we just saw
Those loser us’s from 5 years ago

55 YR OLD BILL
Dudes - you’ve been told this before

55 YR OLD TED
That reality will only happen if you don’t
take this song back with you Those guys
don’t need to exist Trust me Ted - it’s
amazing how fast life can change when you
do the right things

55 YR OLD BILL
But you guys gotta make it happen

TED
We will we will

55 Yr Old Bill and Ted point to two very plush seats - where
the guys sit

BILL
I must say Ted as much as I disliked
those previous us’s I like these us’s

55 YR OLD TED
Okay Enough talking Are you ready to
face the music

Bill and Ted nod as 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted put the most
spectacular pair of over-the-ear EARPHONES on them

And with a nod and a wink at the guys and at each other
they move to the soundboard and hit PLAY

CLOSE ON BILL AND TED

The moment they’ve been waiting for for twenty years is here
And - though we only hear the barest most muffled SENSE of
music from beneath the headphones - from the very first
moment we can tell that it’s not disappointing

A tear is forming in Bill’s eye Ted looks stunned - deeply
impressed but it’s more complex than that

And while this is happening we CUT AWAY TO

EXT MANSION - NIGHT - SAME

The security gate starts to slowly open as a HUGE WHITE LIMO
pulls up in the street outside the mansion Meanwhile --

INT MANSION - SAME

For reasons that are unclear to us the BUTLER sees the
headlights and suddenly snuffs his cigarette out on the
floor spins and bolts through the kitchen and out a door

INT MUSIC STUDIO - SAME

Close on the guys as the song ends Bill’s in tears Ted’s
in disbelief They slowly pull the headphones off

BILL
That is truly the most amazing song I’ve
ever heard

TED
Yah It’s great Honestly I
wouldn’t’ve thought we had it in us

55 YR OLD TED
Well you do and now it’s time to get it
out to the world

TED
I don’t even know how to thank you

55 YR OLD BILL
(re Ted’s watch)
You guys should probably get going
Bill nods shakes his older self’s hand

BILL
I’1l never forget you Bill

55 YR OLD BILL
Right back atcha Billy boy

The handshake turns into an affectionate bearhug Ted looks
at his older self

TED
Well so long I guess

55 YR OLD TED
Yah so long

They nod to each other - somehow slightly wary of each other

INT HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER

As the guys head out Bill looks over at Ted confused

BILL
Dude Why were you acting so weird with
yourself

TED

I just got a weird feeling

BILL
You always have a weird feeling when
youre with other yous

TED
I know I gotta stop being so suspicious
of myself

BILL

Yah you do cuz it’s all gonna be fine

They reach the front door and throw it open extremely
surprised to see --

EDDIE VAN HALEN

Standing there a suitcase at his side a guitar case slung
over his shoulder - his house keys out about to open the
front door

EDDIE VAN HALEN
Wyld Stallyns What the hell are you
doing in my house

BILLTED
Eddie Van Halen

BILL
This is our house dude

EDDIE VAN HALEN
What are you talking about

BILL
This is our house - or at least the house
of future us’s

EDDIE VAN HALEN
You two need to leave right now or I’m
calling the cops

BILL
No you need to leave right now Eddie Van
Halen - or we’ll call the cops

Suddenly - Ted slams the door and slides the deadbolt He
turns and starts purposefully down the hallway

TED
Oh no oh no oh no oh no

INT STUDIO - SAME

55 Yr Old Bill and Ted are undressing - as actors would after
a performance It’s now obvious why their clothes didn’t fit
well because they’re both wearing Eddie Van Halen’s clothes
and he’s bigger than Bill and smaller than Ted

Bill removes his WIG - revealing that he is almost totally
bald (except a thin strip of Friar Tuck hair at the back)

55 YR OLD BILL
I think we totally fooled those other
us’s

Ted pulls his shirt off revealing he is wearing a MALE
GIRDLE He loosens it - he’s easily 80 pounds overweight

55 YR OLD TED
I hope so I didn’t like the way I was
looking at myself

Ted downs a long long swig of Eddie Van Halen’s VODKA

IN THE HALLWAY - SAME
Ted has stopped is staring at one of the magazine covers

TED
I don’t believe it

BILL
What is it

Ted nods to the cover which when you look at it more
carefully is very obviously “photo-shopped”

INT STUDIO - SAME
55 Yr Old Bill and Ted raise their glasses in a toast
55 YR OLD TED

Now We wait for those other us’s to go
back and change everything

55 YR OLD BILL
To our lives gettin’ a whole lot better

(then)
Ted - seriously - slow down on the vodka

dude
Now the door flies open and Bill and Ted enraged storm in

TED
You guys totally lied to us

55 YR OLD BILL
What are you doing here why haven’t you
taken the song back to the Fabulous Forum

BILL
Maybe cuz it’s not our song

55 YR OLD BILL50 YEAR OLD TED
(feigning shock)
What

TED
It’s Eddie Van Halen’s song he wrote it
And this is his house

55 YR OLD TED
On what basis would you say something so
utterly ridiculous

TED
Cuz we just ran into him He’s outside
calling the cops

Older Bill turns to Older Ted frustrated and annoyed
55 YR OLD BILL

Ted I told you Eddie Van Halen came back
this week

55 YR OLD TED
I totally thought he came back next week

The two younger guys look at their older selves shocked

BILL
Youre totally bald Bill

TED
And you’re a fat drunk Ted

55 YR OLD BILL55 YR OLD TED
Heyyyyyy--
TED

What on earth were you guys even
thinking

Older Bill and Ted get up cross to their younger selves
55 YR OLD BILL

What were we thinking That we had the
perfect plan and we still do

55 YR OLD TED
(nodding)
Just cuz you two couldn’t come up with a
great song and Eddie Van Halen did doesn’t
mean we should be punished for that

TED
What That doesn’t even make sense

There is the sound of sirens outside

55 YR OLD BILL
You gotta go right now

BILL
No way it’s not our song

55 YR OLD TED
Take it now and it will be yours When
Eddie Van Halen comes up with it in 10
years he’ll be stealing it from you

BILL’S VOICE
I think it’s a great idea Ted We should
leave right now and do exactly what the wise
older us’s say - regardless of what I might
say immediately following this sentence

TED
Really

BILL
Dude No He’s ventriloquizing me

55 Yr Old Bill shrugs - “innocent”
TED
We’re not gonna do it forget it

55 YR OLD BILL
Fine I guess saving the world is just
irrelevant to you now

BILL
You’re not interested in saving the world -
all you care about is saving your own
pathetic lives

55 YR OLD BILLTED
Wrong

TED
Your blatant cynicism is both transparent
and appalling Ted

55 YR OLD TED
Fine Maybe you’ll care about this
taking the song is your only chance to get
the princesses back

TED
(as if punched in the gut)
You were lying about that

55 YR OLD TED
Of course we were lying They don’t want
to have anything to do with you Cause
they think you’re losers Which you are
Cause you make bad choices Like this

TED
I’m so disappointed in you me

55 YR OLD TED
I don’t care what you think of me Ted
Our life is hell and if you don’t go back
and change it --

TED
Oh - it’s all about you --

55 YR OLD BILL
Ted and Ted - take it easy - this plan
will work - everyone’s life will be better
if you guys just would --

There’s loud pounding on the front door

OS VOICE
It’s the police open up

55 YR OLD BILL
So what do you say - are you gonna do it

or not

BILL
No way dude You had ten years to write
the song --

TED

And we’re not gonna build a fake future on
one that’s not even ours

55 Yr Old Bill and Ted look at each other

55 YR OLD BILL
Fine

He and 55 Yr Old Ted pull out GUNS

55 YR OLD TED
Then we’ll do it We’1l take the song
and the booth and we’ll go back

55 YR OLD BILL
This is our third strike and we’re not
going back to jail I can tell you that

BILL
Dudes - seriously - you don’t have to pull
guns on us

55 YR OLD BILL
Oh yah we do Cause watch what happens if
we don’t

They lower their guns Instantly Bill and Ted try to run
away - scrambling desperately for the door - then stopping
when they hear the loud clicks of the guns

55 YR OLD BILL (CONTD)
See

BILL
I have to admit you were right

Quickly Ted grabs a guitar and swings it into older Ted -
shoving him back into older Bill

TED
You dicks
INT MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Our guys race out the studio door and unsure which way to
turn scramble down the hall and through --

THE LIVING ROOM

Where they race past Bill’s Father - who is now sitting on
his caftan on the floor (wearing his shabby filthy clothes)

MR PRESTON
(teary)
Bill - where are you going

BILL
I can’t believe you participated in this
charade

MR PRESTON
I’m sorry Bill I miss your mother and I
just wanted it all to be good again

Bill looks at his wan pathetic father

BILL
Hang in there Dad - things will get
better at some point
(trying to convince himself)
I mean They have to

And he and Ted rush down--

ANOTHER HALLWAY

But then come to a skidding halt when -- at the staircase at
the end -- they see OLDER BILL AND TED blocking their way

55 YR OLD TED
You guys can’t get away from us you know

55 YR OLD BILL
Yah cuz we totally remember everything
you’re gonna do

Bill and Ted hesitate then suddenly dive out a window

EXT EDDIE VAN HALEN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Bill and Ted roll leap up then stop when they see on the
roof the 55 Yr Old thems are aiming guns at them

55 YR OLD BILL55 YR OLD TED
Told ya

EXT FRONT OF THE HOUSE - SAME
Police cars in the driveway lights flashing A cop is
interviewing Eddie Van Halen A third car squeals into the

driveway and Deacon - ten years older now - jumps out

DEACON
Tell me this isn’t my brother and Bill

COP
Sorry Deac

Deacon sighs grabs a bullhorn and yells
DEACON
Ted Come out right now or I’1l have to
call Dad
EXT BACK OF EDDIE VAN HALEN’S HOUSE - SAME
The guys hear Deacon’s voice on the megaphone
TED
(yells)
Deacon It’s not me
55 YR OLD TED
Yes Deacon It totally IS me

FRONT OF HOUSE

Deacon and the other cops - along with Eddie Van Halen -
listen to the voices from the back yard

TED (0S)
This me talking is from ten years ago and
I don’t have anything to do with this

BILL (0S)
It’s totally true dude It’s the future
us’s that you want

55 YR OLD BILL (0S)
Shut up Bill

BILL (0S)
You shut up Bill

Deacon grabs his radio

DEACON
Dad you gotta get down here

BACK OF HOUSE
Bill looks to Ted

BILL
We gotta make a break for it

TED
Yah but how They’re us - they remember
everything we’re gonna do

BILL
That means we gotta do something we can’t
possibly remember

TED
How do we do that

Ted thinks a moment then

TED (CONTD)
Dude - check it out

Ted pulls his shirt up so his head is hidden His arms
flail

TED (0S) (CONT’D)
I totally can’t see where I am

Bill nods - does the exact same thing And now

UP ON THE ROOF
55 Yr Old Bill and Ted look at each other alarmed

55 YR OLD BILL
Oh no The head in shirt move

55 YR OLD TED
I was hoping those younger us’s wouldn’t
think of it this time

DOWN BELOW

We HEAR Bill and Ted’s voices as we see what basically looks
like two headless bodies running in circles

BILL (0S)
Dude What do we do

TED (0S)
No idea That’s the point

They spin sprinting in odd random chaotic arbitrary
directions - like pinballs - as they rush out the gate and
start spinning down the alley

Falling at times bumping into each other into walls
Tripping getting up For a moment Bill’s shirt drops

BILL
Oh no I can see
(then pulling his shirt up)
Spin me dude I can’t know where I am

Ted spins him and pushes him over and now the two of them
start ROLLING DOWN THE HILL - gaining speed
FRONT OF HOUSE

Into the swarm of police cars out front CHIEF LOGAN
screeches to a halt jumps out enraged

LOGAN
TED

DEACON
Dad I think Ted needs help He was
talking to himself like he’s two people--

LOGAN

This ends now The lies the delusions
I’m done with him I’m done with both of
them

(turns gives the signal)

Take them Now

And the cops burst the door down and race into the house

AT THE BACK OF PROPERTY - SAME
55 Yr Old Bill and Ted yell from the top of the hillside

55 YR OLD BILL
You guys are idiots This woulda worked

55 YR OLD TED
You haven’t heard the last of us We’re
gonna get you Bill and Ted

Suddenly cops come out guns drawn
LOGAN
Drop your weapons and get on the ground
NOW

55 Yr Old Bill and Ted turn to each other

55 YR OLD TED
Dude there is no way I’m going back to
jail

55 YR OLD BILL
Blaze of glory Ted

And - like Butch and Sundance - they just start rushing down
the hill turning back and firing madly as --

LOGAN
Get them NOW

Police fan out start moving keeping cover Deacon and
Logan turn and race back into Deacon’s police car as --
EXT BOTTOM OF THE HILL - NIGHT

Bill and Ted tumble to a stop against a wall and Bill and Ted
dizzily pull their shirts down

BILL
Dude - that totally worked

TED
Yah - maybe we should always not know what
were doing

BILL
We gotta try and get back to the booth

Wobbly they start up the hill hearing GUNSHOTS as--

JUST UP THE HILL

55 Yr Old Bill and Ted scramble from the cops firing as a
police chopper sweeps the area with a searchlight and --
INT DEACON’S POLICE CAR - DRIVING - SAME

Deacon screeches around a turn heading downhill

LOGAN
Down there Hurry Go

Suddenly in the wash of headlights they SEE --
Bill and Ted moving swiftly past them uphill
Deacon slams on the brakes

LOGAN (CONTD)
Turn it around

But it’s a narrow alley - it takes some maneuvering as

BILL AND TED

Race up through some bushes and weave toward --

THE PHONE BOOTH
Into which they leap and start frantically dialing

TED
Dude - where are we going

BILL
We just gotta keep going further into the
future At some point we’ll find the
song

TED
Ten more years

BILL
Yes Gol
(seeing something)
DUDE - what’s that

For a BRIEF INSTANT they think they see ROLLINS again -
leaning against his silver phone booth across the street

But suddenly they’re AWASH IN BRIGHT LIGHT - from the
HELICOPTER above them - as well as from --

DEACON’S POLICE CAR

Which roars up - spotlight fixed on them

LOGAN’S VOICE (ON SPEAKER)
TED Step out of that phone booth Ted

TED
Sorry dad I’m not the me you want
anyway

LOGANS VOICE
I don’t want to hear it Ted Come out
right now

Bill finishes dialing and the booth starts to shimmer

FROM WITHIN DEACON’S POLICE CAR

Logan squints into the bright light

LOGAN
What the hell

He grabs the spotlight from the side of the car - and turns
it on Now --

Its beam shoots forward - and connects with the shimmer of
the phone booth And in so doing the sparks from the
booth’s antenna travel along the beam of the light until

the police car itself begins to shimmer

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Deacon - what the hell is going on

DEACON
I have no idea

Then suddenly -- as the antenna on top of the police car now
sparks like the antenna on top of the booth

EXT POLICE CAR -— CONTINUOUS

The other cop cars all screech to a halt as --

Deacon’s car VANISHES RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES

COPS confused scratch their heads and we cut to

THE CIRCUITS OF TIME - SAME

The phone booth careens past followed a second later by -

DEACON’S POLICE CAR
Where Logan is apoplectic He yells into the microphone
LOGAN
PULL OVER TED PULL OVER NOW
INT PHONE BOOTH - SAME
TED
Dad You gotta go back Put it in

reverse Deacon - go back

But the police car is catching up The guys’ eyes widen as
the police car is ABOUT TO collide with them when --

SOME KIND OF BRIGHT SILVER CROSS TRAFFIC

Flares past in a blur - missing the booth but nearly
colliding with --

THE POLICE CAR

Where Deacon cranks the wheel hard -- screaming -- as --

INT CIRCUITS OF TIME - CONTINUOUS
The police car spins rapidly and

LOGAN
Godddddamnit Teeeeddddddddddd

it whirls into a 360 and shoots off to the side and--

EXT DESERT - SOMEWHERE - DAY
HOLD A BEAT on the vast arid desert until

DEACONLOGAN (0S)
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

the POLICE CAR APPEARS and WHAM It hits the ground with
a thud Beat
INT CAR - CONTINUOUS
Logan and Deacon - speechless and dazed - groggily look up
LOGAN
Where the hell are we
REVERSE ANGLE - THEIR POV

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD they see a half mile in the distance
the GREAT PYRAMID - about 23rds complete

Super Egypt - 3000 BC

Deacon and Logan just sit there in the police car taking it
in For a while Until we cut to

EXT - DENSE FOG - NIGHT

The booth lands - somewhere - some flat grey space The
guys look at each other open the door

BILL
Where are we dude

They look around in the fog hearing something guttural and
awful in the distance low grinding guitar - pounding trash
can-like percussion Death metal - at its darkest

They start toward the music As they do they become aware
of FACES - HARDENED HOLLOW-EYED MEN - in shadowy corners
staring at them as if waiting for something anticipating

As they walk MORE FACES become visible - denser now -
shoulder to shoulder Then two rows deep four and

They start to hear snippets of a song

SONG
PAIN DEATH HOPELESS
HELPLESS4- DYING BREATH
TED

I got a bad feeling about this

Behind the rows of men all watching them as they pass they
see barbed wire And guard towers and guards with guns

They’re in a PRISON With everyone focussed on one thing

Bill and Ted walking through the foggy dimly lit yard
toward

TWO FIGURES
who become more and more distinct as Bill and Ted approach

Super San Quentin 20 years in the future

CLOSER - THE FIGURES

Bill and Ted in their mid-60’s Hardened beyond what we
would ever have imagined shaved heads tattoos heavily
muscled Bill grinds a guitar Ted ‘sings’ - ferociously
growling out the final words which sound something like

65 YR OLD TED
-WELCOME WELCOME TO THE END

Then it ends 65 Yr Old Bill and Ted look up with dead eyes

TED
How’s it goin’ older incarcerated Bill
and Ted

65 YR OLD BILL
How’d you like our song And yah - it
actually is our song

BILL
It’s very you know intense Passionate
But is it the song

65 YR OLD TED
Does that matter

BILL
Well yah - if we’re gonna save the world

65 YR OLD BILL
Does that matter

65 Yr Old Bill and Ted stare-- hard The guys look at each
other concerned

BILL
So-- I think we’ll be leaving now

TED
It was really excellent seeing you guys
good luck with everyth-

65 YR OLD BILL
Youre not going anywhere blondie

BILL
“Blondie” Dude-- I’m you

65 YR OLD BILL
Like I care

The wall of prisoners has circled them and the men are
staring - waiting for what seems to have been promised them

TED
What’s going on

65 YR OLD TED
Our friends here have been waiting for ten
years for the chance to kick your asses

BILL
What

TED
No way

65 YR OLD TED
Way guy

TED
“Guy” You don’t even know my name

65 YR OLD TED
I don’t care what your name is

Prisoners pull out pipes blades-- start to close in

BILL
Seriously dudes you can’t just let us get
killed

TED

Yah - cuz if you do then you totally
wont exist

65 YR OLD BILL
It doesn’t matter

TED
That is most nihilistic

65 YR OLD BILL
It doesn’t matter

BILLTED
Stop saying that

Knives go up to Bill and Ted’s throats

65 YR OLD TED
See you in hell guy

TED
Okay Um I don’t want to be
argumentative here But I don’t think
there could be two souls of the same
person in one hell

65 YR OLD TED
Well there’s two of us here

65 YR OLD BILL
Ted - don’t --

65 YR OLD TED
“Oh I’m Ted and I’m a philosophical
monist”

TED
Well I am And I knew you knew my name

65 YR OLD BILL
Ted - do not get drawn into this argument -
we talked about this -

Suddenly we hear a crackling and see a flash of light in the
sky 65 Yr Old Bill looks at 65 Yr Old Ted with urgency

65 YR OLD BILL (CONT’D)
We gotta do this before that future guy
shows up and --

Suddenly he freezes As does 65 Yr Old Ted
And everyone else around them as
Only Bill and Ted are able to move Their eyes widen as

ROLLINS steps out of the SILVER BOOTH and walks toward the
now completely motionless scene

BILL
How’s it goin’ dude
ROLLINS
You tell me
TED
Bad
BILL
Were looking We’re trying to find the
song
ROLLINS

Well whatever you’re doing is not working

TED
Sorry dude

ROLLINS
I don’t care if you’re sorry There are a
lot of people depending on you You need
to figure this out and you need to figure
it out fast

TED
How We keep going further and further
into the future and things keep getting
worse and worse
(looking at his older self)
I don’t even recognize myself anymore

BILL
I’m starting to think maybe there is no
song
(pause)
Is there no song

ROLLINS
I don’t know You have to figure this out
yourselves

TED

We’ve like travelled through our whole
lives almost

ROLLINS
Have you

A pause The guys look at each other

TED
Well I guess not our whole lives

BILL
Are you saying we should go to the very
end

He just looks at them shrugs

TED
Like our end

A MOMENT LATER

--FLASH -- Bill and Ted in the phone booth - are seen
briefly - worried - as it drops from view revealing

Rollins standing over the frozen scene a look of grave
concern on his face as he steps into his silver booth and it
whooshes away As it goes

the prisoners return to their natural movement

65 YR OLD BILL
Dude - I told you not to have that
argument with yourself

65 YR OLD TED
I went out of my way to make sure it was
shorter

65 YR OLD BILL
It wasn’t Ted - it was the exact same
argument you had back then

65 YR OLD TED
Maybe so - but he was so wrong And I
told you to stop me

65 YR OLD BILL
I was trying I was yelling

EXT ANCIENT EGYPT - 3000 BC

2 DOZEN SLAVES HAUL STONES on a GIANT WAGON up a hill along a
NARROW PATH in the desert Slavedrivers crack whips After
a moment of this we HEAR A SIREN BLIP and

LOGAN
(amplified)
This is the San Dimas Police Please stop
what you’re doing and drop your weapon

The Rear Slavedriver looks back sees

The SAN DIMAS POLICE CAR behind it its lights on

INT POLICE CAR - SAME

Deacon and Logan just sit there looking at the line of
slaves blocking the road in front of them Until

DEACON
So You gonna say it dad or am I
LOGAN
Say what
DEACON
That Ted was right
LOGAN
Just drop it I want us out of here

NOW
(holds mic to his lips)
I said - this is the San Dimas--

DEACON
(rolling his eyes)
Dad --
LOGAN
Fine

Frustrated - Logan sets the mic down opens his car door

EXT CAR - CONTINUOUS

The Slavedriver - and the slaves - all turn and gape as
Logan emerges from the police car putting in his billy club

LOGAN
Have any of you men seen a phone booth
circa USA approximately 1989 Phone
booth

DEACON
(rolls down window)
Dad - it’s 5000 years ago - there’s no
version of that that they understand

LOGAN
(to slavedriver who is raising
his scimitar)
If you draw that weapon I will arrest you
sir

DEACON
Dad - you can’t arrest this guy This is
like three thousand BC

LOGAN
(ignoring Deacon)
Sir - this is your last chance

The guy - uncomprehending - raises his scimitar Logan
shakes his head - grabs his taser - and -

DEACON
Dad - this is a terrible idea

As the slavedriver comes at Logan with his huge blade Logan
instantly shoots him in the bare chest with his taser

The guy shakes violently and crumples to the ground where he
lays there twitching and writhing

The slaves are terrified Another GUARD comes at Logan
Logan tases him too But more and more guards are coming

DEACON (CONTD)
Great Now what are you gonna do

Logan grabs his GUN and FIRES IT INTO THE AIR

Which causes immediate and widespread panic

ON THE WAGON

The slaves scatter - the ones who were pulling the giant
boulder The ones who were securing it It starts to move
JUST BELOW IT

Deacon’s eyes widen

DEACON (CONTD)
Dad

LOGAN
I’m not quite done here -

DEACON
DAD WE HAVE TO GO

Logan turns -- sees the boulder dislodging and starting to
roll He turns quickly And he dives back into --

THE POLICE CAR

Where Deacon steps on the gas

LOGAN
GO Put it in reverse

But the tires spin in the sand and --

THE BOULDER

Gains speed and rolls off the huge wagon - all 25000 pounds
of it toward --

THE POLICE CAR

Which can’t get any traction As just as it starts to move
backwards --

-- CRUUUUUUUUNCH -- the boulder utterly crushes the car
Pause Silence

The slaves and slavedrivers all stop and look as we hold on
the huge motionless boulder in the dust and then we cut to

DARKNESS - SOMEWHERE

WE HOLD for a while As our eyes adjust we begin to sense
that we are in some kind of a deep deep cave

Gradually we begin to SEE some reflected blue and red light
from above and we HEAR an approaching SIREN as

THE POLICE CAR plummets into frame - dropping and dropping
down this seemingly bottomless hole

CAMERA DROPS WITH IT- for a while We see Deacon and Logan
sitting in the front seat -- too gobsmacked to scream

LOGAN (CONTD)
What just happened

DEACON
I think we were crushed by that giant
boulder and killed

A pause Logan looks around nodding

LOGAN
So where are we then

DEACON
My guess is we are falling to --

Suddenly there’s a loud WHOOOMPH as the car hits the ground
and bounces a moment before stopping entirely

As the dust clears around them we see red fiery light
playing off their faces as they look around and gape And we
cut to

EXT SAN DIMAS CALIFORNIA
Were outside a REST HOME as - FLASH - the shimmering phone
booth appears and lands Bill and Ted get out approach the

front door

Super San Dimas California 50 Years In the Future

INT REST HOME - A MOMENT LATER

Bill and Ted enter turn and go down a hallway toward an open
door backlit with light They cross and enter --

INT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-- Where they step in and see in two beds TWO VERY VERY
OLD MEN-- 95 YEAR OLD BILL AND TED

Ancient frail in the final moments of their lives They
look up with grateful recognition as Bill and Ted enter

TED
(gently)
How’s it goin’

95 YR OLD TED
All I can say is we’re so glad youre
finally here

95 YR OLD BILL
And so happy to be able to share the song
with you

TED
So then-- there is a song

95 YR OLD TED
As it turns out there is

BILL
When was it written

95 YR OLD BILL
A long long time ago You just didn’t
recognize it

TED
Is it good
95 YR OLD BILL
It’s amazing You can’t imagine how proud
youll feel when you play it

BILL
When do we play it

95 YR OLD BILL
Tonight

The guys look at each other amazed excited Then

TED
Is there a title

The ancient thems look at each other Then back at the

95 YR OLD BILL
It’s called

95 YR OLD TED
Face the Music

The guys take this in It’s clear it’s the truth
Exchanging a look Bill and Ted separate

BILL
(taking his older self’s hand)
Bill I just want to say thank you for
all the times you’ve been there for me

95 YR OLD BILL
I’m so sorry for the times I let you down
Bill

BILL
(voice catching)
You never did Bill you never did

At the same time on the other side of the room

TED
I feel like I never really knew you Ted

95 YR OLD TED
I know that’s my fault I never truly
opened myself up to you The truth is-- I
looked at you and saw myself

TED
I know me too

95 YR OLD TED
But now as I reach the end there’s so
much that I want to say to you

guys

We hear crying and MOVE BACK TO THE BILLS Bill is hugging
his ancient dying self whose eyes are dimming

95 YR OLD BILL
Te adoro Guillermo

BILL
I’1l never forget you Bill Ever

Bill looks over to Ted who leans close to 95 Yr Old Ted

TED
There is one more thing we need to ask
you

95 YR OLD TED
I know Elizabeth and Joanna
(a pause voice catching)
We haven’t seen them since the day they
left

TED
Oh no please don’t say that

95 YR OLD TED
But I’m afraid it’s true

TED
Does it have to be that way

95 Yr Old Ted takes Ted’s hand

95 YR OLD TED
Unless you two change it

TED
Can we

95 YR OLD TED
Of course you can None of this has to
happen

95 YR OLD BILL
Believe us When the song is played
everything will change

BILL
But how are we gonna play it We don’t
even know what it is

95 YR OLD TED
Its with you It’s with you right now

TED
Where

95 Yr Old Ted starts to point - but his hand drops He looks
at ancient Bill They both nod ever-so-slightly then look
back at their younger selves and say

95 YR OLD BILL AND TED
Catch you later Bill and Ted

And with that they die
Bill and Ted stare for a long moment Then
BILL
Dude-- In honor of our late selves I
propose that we get back to the Fabulous

Forum and immediately play our song

Ted nods Meanwhile

IN HELL - SAME

The cop car cruises along slowly demons and anguished souls
peering in crowding them making it difficult to navigate

Logan flicks the lights on top and BLIPS the siren a couple
times Then gets on the mic and says amplified

LOGAN
Please move away from the vehicle I
repeat please move away from the vehicle
immediately

No change If anything it’s getting more difficult to move

DEACON
Dad - that is lame I mean we’re in
hell

LOGAN

Now you’re telling me how to be a police
officer You gonna replace me there too

DEACON
Finally it comes out

LOGAN
Finally what comes out Deacon

DEACON
That this is about Missy

LOGAN
I’m sorry - when you say “Missy” are you
referring to your wife - or are you
referring to my ex-wife Oh - oh - I’m
sorry - they’re the same person

(MORE )

LOGAN (CONTD)
(re tortured souls)
You know what Stop the car I’m gonna
deal with this

Logan pushes the door open and steps outside

EXT CAR - CONTINUOUS

Logan stands about a head or two ABOVE the hunched-over
TORMENTED SOULS as TWO FEARSOME DEMONS approach and growl

LOGAN
I need you to move these people out of the
way please

The Demons come toward him eyes glowing

LOGAN (CONTD)
I’m telling you to freeze right there
sir Both of you
(as they keep coming)
Consider yourselves warned

Now Logan removes his BEAN BAG GUN from his belt and FIRES
THREE BEAN BAGS INTO THE FIRST DEMON’S CHEST who falls over
backward with a wail The other demon keeps coming Logan
CLUBS HIM WITH HIS BILLY CLUB - then MACES HIM As the Demon
grabs his eyes moaning Logan reflexively cuffs him

Deacon exits is now standing on the other side of the car
DEACON
Good work dad What are you gonna do
about the rest of them

Logan turns sees what Deacon’s referring to

Two HUGE DEMONS are lumbering menacingly toward them

Logan looks out then looks down at his weapons

LOGAN
Let’s get back in the car

DEACON
Good idea

They re-enter the car Suddenly STARTLED as they see

Sitting in the back seat is DEATH black-clad white-faced
Very very somber

LOGAN
Who the hell are you

DEATH
I am “Death” I knew your son and his
friend Bill We were band mates

We sense in Death a kind of longing - he misses those ever-so-
brief good moments the last (and only) ones of his life

DEATH (CONT’D)
(very straight-faced)
Man did I party hard Too hard it turned
out And the women Whoo-boy Yes I
was a player

He looks off nostalgic

LOGAN
Excuse me
(as Death turns back)
Why are you here Are you just here to
reminisce Because we actually need to
find a way out of here

DEATH
Yes I can help you I’ve still got some
‘juice’ around here This way

Death makes a gesture out the window and a slight path opens
As Deacon starts to drive

DEATH (CONTD)
So how is the band Have the guys come
up with the song yet

LOGAN
No - and they never will They’re
delusional

DEATH

Oh - you still think that

DEACON
I know That’s what I’ve been saying

LOGAN
Hey you know what-

DEATH

(raising a hand)
Excuse me Gentlemen Please I get
enough conflict down here Can we just
have some chill tunes

DEACON
You know I think that’s a good idea

Deacon turns on the CD player JACK JOHNSON’S “BETTER
TOGETHER” comes on

DEATH
Mnnn Love me my Jack Johnson

He sits back slightly moving to the beat as --

FROM A HIGH WIDE SHOT The police car cruises through hell
Jack Johnson music wafting up HOLD a moment then cut to

EXT FABULOUS FORUM - NIGHT

The MARQUEE reads “TONIGHT - WYLD STALLYNS presents ‘Two
Decades of Triumphance’” There’s a FLASH in the sky anda
moment later the booth lands and the guys jump out and rush
towards the artists’ entrance As they run

TED
I still don’t understand How are we
gonna play the greatest song ever written
when we don’t even know it

BILL
Ted you heard us we have it with us
Weve obviously been over-thinking this

We just have to let it happen

So we’re just gonna make it up as we go

BILL

Ted nods not totally convinced as the guys hurry towards -

EXT ARTISTS’ ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
The guys move quickly to Frank

FRANK
Gotta admit-- didn’t think you two’d
actually show up
(into radio)
They’re here Cut the house lights

Frank throws open a door marked “STAGE” and they push in as
in front of them the arena dims They look nervously at
each other

BILL
Our world is about to change dude

They mount the steps toward the side curtains which block--
THE STAGE
Which is lit But the guys don’t see much of it - yet

BILL (CONTD)
Ready Ted

TED
Ready Bill

And they stride past a curtain and onto

THE STAGE

Which is totally empty No mics No instruments Nothing

They stand in the glare of the bright lights on the totally
bare stage It’s too dark in the audience to see out

TED (CONTD)
Dude What’s going on

BILL
I don’t know Maybe we gotta keep going

TED
Going where

BILL
To the mics

TED
There are no mics

very very bad dream

BILL
Hello

TED (CONTD)
Um Could we have the house lights up

A beat later - a loud KA-CHUNK and the guys stare out at

Bored USHERS motionlessly man utterly empty tunnels
CONCESSION WORKERS stand idly behind their counters

ON STAGE

Bill and Ted just look around confused disoriented

TED (CONTD)
I don’t understand

DING DING DING a warning light goes off on the timepiece
TWO MINUTES LEFT Suddenly the guys feel something strange

Their feet are starting to move They gape at each other -
terrified - as

They begin sliding backwards - WHAM - into the phone booth

Which lights up automatically and quickly SHOOTS DOWN through
the pavement and is gone Revealing

ROLLINS by his booth watching He steps back inside and
WHOOSH It’s gone too

EXT FORUM - NIGHT

Above the sky starts to DARKEN ominously LIGHTNING
flashes Some cracks start to appear in the ground We PAN
TO

THE 76 STATION ACROSS FROM THE FORUM

Where a guy gets out of his car to pump gas and stops short -
totally baffled as he sees

An EQUALLY CONFUSED ROMAN SOLDIER - in toga with lst century
weaponry - just standing there under the fluorescent light
of the gas station

Both men stare at each other utterly confounded And we cut
to

waiting In silence For a long while Until finally

Deacon nods Footsteps Death approaches exiting a heavy
gold door

Well I’m afraid you don’t get to make the--

LOGAN
No No nono My son is in serious
jeopardy - and I have a job to do

He pushes past Death and through the gold door which closes
with a solid whoomph

Deacon and Death look at each other as OFFSCREEN we hear
Logan’s insistent muffled voice - and a lower booming also
muffled voice - talking over each other
Death looks at Deacon raises an eyebrow
DEATH
Wow Your old man has a very big ball

sack bro

There’s a brief beat of silence Followed by a low PHHUP-
PHHHHHUP and then

MUFFLED AUTHORITARIAN VOICE
OW-OWWWW

Which is then followed by a very heavy THUD And groaning

And then Logan storms out eyes straight ahead - jaw fixed -
holding a GILDED SKELETON KEY

DEACON
Did you just bean-bag God Dad

LOGAN
Yes I did Get in

Deacon turns - follows his father to the car
DEATH
Ill try to smooth this out Say hi to the
fellas for me And - oh - one thing Can
I keep that chill Jack Johnson CD
Deacon hands Death the CD the police car screams away then
shimmers and disappears and we cut to

INT GREAT DOME - DAY --BANG - the phone booth lands roughly followed a half beat
later by the silver booth

The guys get out - shaken - and find themselves face to face
with the THREE GREAT LEADERS who are scowling furious

LEADER
You have failed utterly

Though inside the dome we HEAR UTTER CHAOS coming from
outside thunder - the ground is quaking - screaming
people in the dome are running

LEADER (CONTD)
Why we ever put our hopes in you two
idiots is beyond me

And he and the others turn stride off There is a final
BEEEEEEP on the timepiece as it runs out The guys just
stand looking down at it-- horrified speechless

Then Rollins steps between them They look at him

BILL
What’s going to happen

Rollins indicates for them to follow

WITH THE GUYS - A MOMENT LATER

As Rollins leads them shell-shocked into the room which
houses the TIMELINE

ROLLINS
This is the new reality

He points all the way down towards antiquity

BILLTED
Whoa

The time line appears to be fraying bending upward
twisting back in on itself contorting - like a hose out of
control or a downed electrical line

The guys move closer Ted touches it Suddenly an image
pops up The BUDDHA is running in panic from --

A CAVEMAN - who catches him and CLUBS HIM on the head

TED
Whoooaaaa Dude-- the Buddha just got
clubbed by a caveman

Bill moves forward touches the timeline We see the Last
Supper -- 12 people sitting in a torch-lit tent Suddenly
two OMINOUS SHADOWS appear on the tent wall and we HEAR a
pair of loud SCREECHES as aFEARSOME CLAW suddenly tears the
tent The 12 disciples leap and run as --

Bill turns to Ted

BILL
Ted if I’m not mistaken I believe the
Last Supper was just disrupted by a pair
of velocirapters

TED
Oh no

They cross together Look at the line

TED (CONTD)
Dude It’s like everything is just
blending together

ROLLINS
It’s collapsing in on itself Starting at
the ends - and moving toward the middle

TED
It’s in 1400 now Does that mean it’s
about to hit

The guys look at each other then look toward medieval times -
the 1400’s - suddenly grasping something -

TED (CONTD)
You brought our families there

ROLLINS
That I did
TED
Why
BILL
Ted --
TED
Why would you do that
BILL

Ted - it doesn’t matter now We just
gotta get there and get em back

Ted looks at Rollins - then follows Bill as

THE GUYS RUN

Through the chaos and into the phone booth and we cut to

EXT ENGLAND 1428 - DAY

The booth appears on TOP OF A CASTLE WALL and Bill and Ted
leap out suddenly stopping and reacting in horror

TED
Dude - look

WITHIN THE CASTLE guarded by dozens and dozens of fearsome-
looking KNIGHTS in armor who are brandishing swords--

Joanna Elizabeth Will Theo - as well as the Duke and
Duchess - are bound and are being led along SCAFFOLDING
toward 6 NOOSES

The King stands nearby and shouts out over the chaos
KING

For bringing darkness into our world this
entire family must die

Bill and Ted look in the other direction below them -
OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - pounding on the gates and trying to ram
down the castle walls - are

SOLDIERS FROM EVERY ERA - Trojan warriors Incas Nazis Red
Coats - you name it - all ramming the gates Scaling the
walls pulling pins in grenades etc And more are coming
from other directions

BILL
Dude what are we gonna do There’s not
just guards and executioners in the castle
- but there’s like armies from all through
history outside the castle

TED
I know And we got like 30 seconds to
figure it out and we’d need like 30 years

BILL
But dude-- we don’t got 30 years to figure
it out
TED
(a beat)
We don’t
BILL

What What do you mean

TED
We don’t - cause we’re just starting to
think about it now But what if we start
thinking about it thirty years ago

BILL
How We’d have to start when we’re like
ten

TED
Exactly

BILL
(eyes widening)
Whoa Dude That means alls we gotta do

is--

TED
--go back and find ourselves when we’re
ten --

BILL

-- when we actually have 30 years to think
about it and get ourselves thinking
about it

(turns)
Ted - you have had many ingenious ideas
which on the surface seem
counterintuitive But this is the
counterintuitivest of them all Let’s go
dude

They jump back into the phone booth quickly dial With a
flash the booth disappears and we cut to

INT BILL’S CHILDHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT
VAN HALEN’S “RUNNIN’ WITH THE DEVIL” plays on the tape deck
as 10 year old Bill and Ted jump on the beds playing air
guitar and singing along
Super San Dimas California 1980
The door opens and 14 YEAR OLD MISSY sticks her head in
14 YEAR OLD MISSY
You guys need to brush your teeth and get
ready for bed Your folks will be home

soon Bill

10 YEAR OLD BILL
Okay Missy

She puts her Walkman headphones back on exits

10 YEAR OLD TED
Dude your babysitter is cute

10 YEAR OLD BILL
I know remember when we were in
kindergarten and she was in third and we
asked her to the pumpkin dance

They hear LOUD RAPPING on the window There outside in
shadows desperate and frenetic are adult Bill and Ted

BILL
Dudes Let us in Hurry

10 YEAR OLD TED
Wh-who are you

TED
Don’t worry We’re you it’s fine

The boys - terrified - turn and try to run out - but Bill and
Ted open the window and rush in and catch them at the door

BILL
Dudes listen to us Were you We’re
what you will become

TED
Yah - and we’re here to prevent you from
destroying time and space as we know it

BILL
Not to mention destroying your marriages
And alienating your kids

TED
Elizabeth is gonna be the love of your
life Ted and you’re gonna blow it And
Will and Theo will think you two are
completely blind idiots which you are

BILL
You will be lonely beyond description
without Joanna Bill Especially when mom
walks out on you and never comes back

TED
But Here’s the good news It doesn’t
have to happen

BILL
Yah alls you gotta do is take the next 30
years to figure out how to save your wives
and sons and in-laws from being hanged in
1428 Simple right

TED
But you gotta start now - like right now

The two boys are too stunned and scared to speak Bill and
Ted kneel down get right in their own faces

BILL
So-- ARE you gonna spend the next 30 years
figuring this out Are you Are you
The two kids looking like they’re about to cry are so
scared that they cannot even manage tiny little nods Bill
and Ted look at each other
TED
Dude they’re not getting it What do we
do

INT PHONE BOOTH - MOMENT LATER

Bill and Ted shove their beyond-terrified whimpering
trembling younger selves into the booth As Ted dials

A CAR screeches into Bill’s driveway and a woman (35 pretty
curly blonde hair) rushes towards them yelling at the top of
her lungs--

WOMAN
STOP WHAT ARE YOU DOING

Bill’s jaw drops in amazement as the booth sparks
Bill and Little Bill both press their faces to the glass

BILLLITTLE BILL
MOM

MRS PRESTON
BILL

But the shimmering booth is now dropping--

And just before it disappears Bill notices that --

IN THE SWIRLING VORTEX

Mrs Preston has slipped and tumbled in and now --

IN THE CIRCUITS OF TIME - CONTINUOUS
Bill is horrified
BILL
Oh no I always knew I was responsible

for my mom’s leaving

TED
Dude you weren’t

BILL
Ted I literally just was Mom

MRS PRESTON (0S)
(voice disappearing)
BILLLLLL1111111111

Bill and Little Bill stare in horror and we cut to

EXT ENGLAND - ON TOP OF THE CASTLE WALL The booth lands back on the parapet and Bill and Ted drag
their 10 year old selves out of it

BILL
Bill stop crying Even though Mom’s
gone I love you and I will always be
there for you

TED
Dude - you can’t promise that

BILL
Okay - I won’t be there for you But you
are gonna have to be there for us

TED
Yah You guys have to see this

Gradually the terrified 10 year olds open their eyes

TED (CONTD)
Now Is this burned on your brain

The kids stare down at the confusion royal guards on the
inside - soldiers from all of time on the outside climbing
the walls clambering to get in

Their younger selves give horrified nods

BILL
Good Now Here’s what you need to do

TED
See those people down there Those are
your beloved wives and sons - and that’s
their grandparents They’re about to be
hung by their necks till they’re dead

BILL
You don’t want that to happen Spend the
next thirty years coming up with a plan to
get us out of this

TED
And do it fast Cause we only got about
thirty seconds and we don’t have any idea
what to do

BILL
Now get going
(swatting his young self on the
ass)
Get

TED
(shoving himself roughly)
In

As they shove the kids back into the booth and speed-dial the
numbers --

BILL
Even though space-time is unravelling -
because of you - it doesn’t matter You
have to save them

TED
So don’t blow it

BILL
Don’t blow anything

TED

Do everything right always You two -
alone - are responsible for saving

everything Okay
And BOOM The booth is gone Alerting the attention of TWO
GUARDS WITH BOWS AND ARROWS who turn on the parapet and
start toward

Bill and Ted - who quickly spot--

A STAIRWELL

and hurry into it mulling what just happened as they rush
down it

TED (CONTD)
I don’t think that went particularly well

BILL
Yah I think in our desperation we came
on a bit too strong

TED
I know midway through I started to
totally remember this whole thing from
when it happened to us

BILL
I know I’d always thought that was just
some weird nightmare

TED
Yah - the worst nightmare of all time

BILL
Totally So bad that I musta completely
blocked it out

TED
But now that we’re talking about it - it’s
like in the back of my mind I’ve always
been thinking about it

BILL
I know Me too

TED
Dude Is it even possible that it worked

BILL
What do you mean

TED
Well What if we now have been thinking
about this - subconsciously - for thirty
years

BILL
I don’t know Then I guess we’d know more
about what to do

TED
Yah Like I don’t know

Ted reaches into his jacket packet and pulls out the LARGE
BLOB OF YARN

BILL
Dude you’re gonna knit

TED
I don’t think so I think I’m gonna just
do This

Ted holds the yarn blob right in front of Bill - AND
INSTANTLY - there’s a “THWOOK” - and A SPEEDING ARROW lodges
right in the blob - and not into Bill

BILLTED
Whoa

Suddenly Ted turns shifts his arm and - THWOOK-THWOOK - two
more arrows lodge into the blob From the CASTLE GUARDS
who’d just seen them on the parapet

They look at each other and now burst out a door and into --

A COURTYARD ON THE CASTLE GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

Where it’s chaos soldiers and denizens from all of time
drop down over the walls and swarm doing battle with the
royal guards Bill and Ted make their way out

BILL
Dude - you have been thinking about this
That must be why you’ve been making yarn
blobs all these years

TED
Whoa Yah I wonder what you’ve been
thinking about

BILL
I don’t know I look forward to finding
out

Suddenly they both freeze as they HEAR LOUD VOICES IN ANCIENT
CHINESE and they turns slowly to see

2 DOZEN HUNS stand before them spears raised with a LEADER
yelling in Mongolian

SUBTITLE KILL THEM BOTH
Bill and Ted’s eyes widen -

TED
Whoa

Ted yanks a knitting needle holds it “threateningly” It
does nothing The Huns come closer Suddenly --

AN OFFSCREEN VOICE YELLS LOUDLY IN ANCIENT MONGOLIAN
SUBTITLE LEAVE THEM - KEEP MOVING NOW

The Huns look at the guys for a second And then move on
pushing past

TED (CONTD)
Whoa I didn’t even see who said that

Bill looks at TED with a little smile And then with his
mouth completely closed he says

BILL’S VOICE
Me neither dude

TED
Whoa I’m not sure what’s more
impressive your ventriloquism or your
use of ancient Mongolian

BILL
Thanks And I spent that whole summer and
only learned two phrases I guess I won’t
get to use the other one
(then turning)
Hing tak ga

SUBTITLE EXCUSE ME DUDE

He steps aside as a Mongolian warrior moves past almost
hitting him Gaining confidence now they start moving
again

TED
(pointing)
Our families are just on the other side of
that wall

Indeed - there’s a LARGE CASTLE WALL just on the other side
of this courtyard

BILL
How we gonna get through all this and over
there

They see a HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE moving through the chaos

BILLTED
Camp Weekhoko - summer of 83

They two of them race to the wagon and slide under -
immediately get into “crab-walking” position (legs forward
hands behind body facing up) and - using the carriage as
“cover” - they crab-walk exceedingly fast - scuttling forward
under the carriage They are very good at it (And they
know it)

TED
Dude - that whole summer - all the
counselors were like “don’t you wanna do
anything besides crab-walk”

BILL
And we were like --

BILLTED
Nope

TED
Now we know why

And they roll out - rise Look at the wall - and then look
at TWO FELLED FLAG POLES which have just been knocked from
the walls

TED (CONTD)
Pole vault

BILL
Good idea dude

They each grab an end of one of the long flagpoles and try to
plant the pole but they both just end up running along the
pole with it sliding through their hands until they both face
plant at the other end of the wood

TED
Dude

BILL
I know I just remembered we never
learned how to pole vault

TED
Then why did we think these poles were a
good idea

The guys look at the long wooden sticks they are holding in
their hands

A MOMENT LATER
Bill and Ted are STILT-WALKING - 25 feet in the air

TED (CONTD)
I’m not sure this was such a good idea
either We’re still not high enough to
get over the wall

BILL
I know And I feel somewhat vulnerable
and exposed

Below them HORDES OF SOLDIERS are approaching their long
spindly wooden “legs”

TED
Maybe we should wave to them like Uncle
Sam

BILL
Dude - what does Uncle Sam say

BILLTED
(alternating while waving)
Good day citizens Happy Fourth of July
We are Uncle Sam We want you To stop
trying to knock us over

TED
Dude - we have to remember to not have
this misguided stilt-walking plan

Below them SOLDIERS whack the stilts The guys teeter

BILL
Well there must be some reason we did it

They hear an os SCREECH and suddenly see TWO HUGE SCALY
REPTILIAN CLAWED FEET rise up over the wall

TED
That’s why

They reach up and grab the legs Now look up and see the
UNDERBELLY of a huge scaly flying beast

Below - the shadow of a PTERODACTYL moves toward the wall as
the guys rise up

BILL
Dude - I hate to even ask this question
But how - and when - could we have learned
how to ride pterodactyls

TED
I’m not sure we did dude

BILL
Oh yah

They look at each other -- and then just fall to the ground
with a double WHUMPF as we hear heavy wings flump away
EXT CASTLE COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

They look up They are at the feet of the executioners --
just yards away from where their wives and children have

their heads on blocks

BILL TED
Joanna Theo Elizabeth Will

Their families look up as Bill and Ted rise full of
confidence

BILL
Stop executioners
TED
Unhand our families Now
JOANNA
Bill
ELIZABETH
Ted

Suddenly swords appear at their necks

BILL
Apparently 30 years was not quite enough
time
SCAFFOLDING

Bill and Ted’s heads are placed in nooses next to the others
The guys look at their wives and sons

TED
Liz Will I’m sorry We tried to save
the world - but we failed

BILL
(to Joanna and Theo)
We tried to save you - and we failed that
too

BILLTED
I love you both

The King nods - the hangmen start away from the scaffolding

TED
I must say - it’s darkly ironic that the
name of the song we supposedly wrote is
“Face the Music”

BILL
(nods)
Cuz I think that’s what we’re about to do

There’s a beat Will and Theo look at each other

WILL
Wait - dad - what did you say the song was
called

TED

Face the Music

Now the women look at each other then at Bill and Ted
grasping something

Below the King gets in position for the execution

ELIZABETH
Ted

JOANNA
Bill

BILLTED
What

The women nod to the boys who are looking at their dads

And suddenly it hits Bill and Ted like a tidal wave Their
eyes widen They look at their sons

BILL
That’s your song isn’t it

Ted wriggles a hand free manages to reach into his pocket
and pull out the now-crumpled sheet of paper that he took
from Will the night before

He unfolds it And opens it It’s sheet music Written on
the top are the words “FACE THE MUSIC”

TED
I’ve had it in my pocket the whole time

Now below the King gives a signal The executioners move
toward the lever - and begin to pull it

BILL
That future guy was right there is a
song

TED

I just kinda wish we’d figured this out a
bit sooner

They are all about to hang when suddenly from outside the
castle we hear

AN AMPLIFIED VOICE
Citizens of Medieval England this is the
San Dimas Police Come out of the castle
immediately I repeat Come out of the
castle immediately This is your last

Warning

Suddenly CANISTERS fly over the wall and pink TEAR GAS fills
the air People wheeze cough cry as--

DEACON’S POLICE CAR crashes through a gate and drives into
the castle courtyard smashing into the base of the wooden
scaffolding bringing it all toppling to the ground

Logan jumps out in a gas mask As he frees the Logans and
Prestons the Duke and Duchess

TED
Dad What are you doing here

LOGAN
I was wrong about you Ted - and I’m sorry
- and we’re all leaving Come on
(then - to the Duke and Duchess)
Chet Logan Ted’s dad

DUKE
John and this is my wife Mary Duke and
Duchess of North Umberland

This while they rush through the melee - pile into the car -
5 in front 5 in back Deacon slams it into gear - and it
accelerates shimmers and disappears

INT CIRCUITS OF TIME - A MOMENT LATER
Windblown chaotic lights swirling Deacon tries to

navigate as the car careens through - barely The Duke is in
Logan’s lap Between them the Duchess is on Theo’s lap

Bill and Ted are in the back with Joanna Elizabeth and Will

DEACON
Where are we going Ted

TED
The Fabulous Forum

Deacon cranks the wheel - the car shakes violently - as if
crossing a bridge that’s an the brink of giving out

LOGAN
This is impossible

Suddenly a SILVER STREAK OF LIGHT FLASHES PAST THEM

DEACON
What is that

The guys look forward -- it’s THE SILVER BOOTH With Rollins
inside He nods - beckons them to follow

TED
It’s help

BILL
Follow him

Deacon does And now through the shuddering circuits of
time they swoop and swerve - until finally--

EXT FABULOUS FORUM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY

The police car drops to the ground in front of the Forum -
where the ground is shaking and cracking They race out of

the car --

TED
Duck

And have to squat to avoid a pack of PIRATES who are firing
muskets at come COWBOYS

They all start moving with their families As they pass the
silver booth--

Rollins emerges - joining them He carries two large cases

BILL
Dude - thank you

TED
Do you think it’s too late

ROLLINS
Well see
(then)
My dad always said you’d figure it out
sooner or later

The guys slow

BILL
Wait

TED
Is your dad Rufus

Rollins nods And they all start through--

THE TUNNEL
Which is over-run with anachronistic madness
Logan billy clubs a Samurai Deacon tases a Sabertooth tiger

Joanna beanbags a Nazi Elizabeth pepper sprays George
Washington

GEORGE WASHINGTON
My eyes My eyes

ELIZABETH
Sorry Sorry

They make their way through fending off whatever “obstacles”
are in their way Bill and Ted turn to Rollins

TED
Okay - dude - you have to tell us now
BILL
Why did you take our families back to
1428
ROLLINS

It was obvious that there was no version
of you guys seeing what was right in front
of you until it was no longer right in
front of you

Bill and Ted look at him - and he points - indicating

THE STAGE

Where in all directions it’s utter mayhem Every century -
every epoch - crashing up against each other

The Forum is shaking - a crack is forming in its ceiling
Bill and Ted rise and walk on - joining Will and Theo

WILL
What do we do

BILL
You just play

WILL
What do we play with

Rollins opens the two cases The boys look inside it’s
Bill and Ted’s amazing guitars The boys look at their dads

THEO
Those are your guitars

TED
They’re yours now

The boys look at their moms

JOANNA
It’s a great song Theo Just go ahead
and play it

BILL
Wait You’ve heard it

ELIZABETH
Dozens of times

WILL
The thing is It’s kind of a Well it’s
a bigger sound

THEO
Yeah - it’s not really something we can
play on our own We kind of need
everybody

TED
I’m not sure I know it

WILL
It’s okay Dad Alls you gotta do is
follow along

Bill and Ted look at each other Nod Pick up two other
guitars that Rollins is handing them

BILL
I think we can do that

Joanna and Elizabeth sit at the drums and keyboard Bill and
Ted remain just outside the limelight - but there behind the
boys Who look at each other Cross to center stage

THEO
Ready Will

WILL
Ready Theo

THEO
One

WILL
Two

WILLTHEO

One two three four

And from the VERY FIRST NOTE of the VERY FIRST CHORD

ALL AROUND THE FORUM

What began as the most violent chaotic out of control
Altamont-like riot becomes the greatest Woodstock-type peace
and love festival of all time

Fights stop Soldiers put down their weapons take seats

The crack in the ceiling recedes

Fans start to fill in from aisles they take seats Others
come in through the tunnels

Other people are suddenly there as well

Logan takes a seat up front next to the Duke and Duchess and
MR PRESTON who nods - still bummed and lonely-looking
Missy is sitting with them Deacon joins them

Bill and Ted look at each other - smile - beginning to get a
feel for the music They glance at their wives who smile
back

As the song continues And Will and Theo begin to pick up
their rhythm and confidence

The arena continues to fill in more and more Now there are
2000 Now 4000

Rollins watches from the wings as

The Forum is now full -- except for a few empty seats by
Bill’s father

--until there’s a FLASH OF LIGHT and --
Dropping into one of the seats is

BILL
MOM

MRS PRESTON (at 75) who shimmers and drops plops down
right next to Mr Preston

MR PRESTON
Louise

They embrace joyfully Then suddenly there are SIX QUICK
FLASHES and with them - like a crazy slot machine suddenly
paying off

Six more Mrs Prestons - in ages varying from 35 to 70 - into
the same row

MR PRESTON (CONTD)
Louise Louise

They all converge - hugging him
Ted looks at Bill - who is thrilled

TED
You got seven moms dude

And now the music really kicks in

And the guys’ 95 year old selves couldn’t have possibly been
more correct when they said Bill and Ted would never feel
prouder in their lives

The family plays the song The crowd is cheering arms in
the air exultant thrilled singing along-- present at the
pivotal moment of history and feeling it

WIDE SHOT - THE FORUM

As the song rolls on rocking the giant stadium we cut to

THE YEARS ROLLING BY

More GRANDCHILDREN sitting at their feet And Joanna and
Elizabeth - 95 now too - at their sides Will and Theo -
now 75 - with them There are GREAT GRANDCHILDREN

even GREAT GREAT GRANDCHILDREN The lawn is full teeming
with life

And that voice we heard at the very beginning of the movie
belongs to 95 YEAR OLD BILL - who looks out with 95 YEAR OLD
TED - at the generation upon generation of family before
them

They are completing the telling of a long long story
95 YEAR OLD BILL
And as they looked back on everything
they’d done Everywhere they’d been
Everyone they’d known

95 YEAR OLD TED
There was only one word to describe it

There’s a pause The old men look at each other - then out
at their children and their children’s children

And smile And say - quietly - and with deep conviction

BILLTED
Excellent

CLOSE ON BILL AND TED

Smiling watching out over all of it with Joanna and
Elizabeth now sitting at their sides holding their hands
And then cut to

EXT PORCH - DAY

Empty The rocking chairs are motionless The house is now
silent And we

And then after the very last credit We CUT TO

EXT SAN DIMAS - 1980 - NIGHT

--FLASH The PHONE BOOTH lands in the lawn of Bill’s
childhood home And out of it step

10 year old Bill and Ted Who turn - sort of shell-shocked -
but now able to grasp the enormity of what just happened

They turn Gradually And take in the thing that just
brought them here the PHONE BOOTH

Wide-eyed they look at each other
