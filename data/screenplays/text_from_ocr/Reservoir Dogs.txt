trillion times Im listening to

NICE GUY EDDIE

Andy

MR BLONDE

NICE GUY EDDIE

MR PINK
(laughing)
I love this kid hes a madman
this guy

MR BLONDE
Do you have any idea what these
ladies make They make shit

MR WHITE
Dont give me that She dont
make enough money she can quit

laughs

NICE GUY EDDIE
I dont even know a Jew whod have
the balls to say that So lets
get this straight You never ever
tip

MR WHITE
I dont tip because society says I
gotta I tip when somebody
deserves a tip When somebody
really puts forth an effort they
deserve a little something extra
But this tipping automatically
that shits for the birds As far
as Im concerned theyre just
doin their job

MR BLUE
Our girl was nice

MR WHITE
Our girl was okay She didnt do
anything special
MR BLONDE
Whats something special take ya
in the kitchen and suck your dick

They all laugh

NICE GUY EDDIE
Id go over twelve percent for
that

MR WRITE
Look I ordered coffee Now weve
been here a long fuckin time and
shes only filled my cup three
times When I order coffee I
want it filled six times

MR BLONDE
What if shes too busy

MR WHITE
The words too busy shouldnt be
in a waitresss vocabulary

NICE GUY EDDIE
Excuse me Mr White but the last
thing you need is another cup of
coffee

They all laugh

MR WHITE
These ladies arent starvin to
death They make minimum wage
When I worked for minimum wage I
wasnt lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tipworthy

NICE GUY EDDIE
Ahh now were getting down to it
Its not just that hes a cheap
bastard--

MR ORANGE
--It is that too--

NICE GUY EDDIE
--It is that too But its also
he couldnt get a waiter job You
talk like a pissed off dishwasher
Fuck those cunts and their
Mr

White

fucking tips

MR BLONDE
So you dont care that theyre
counting on your tip to live

rubs two of his fingers together

MR WHITE
Do you know what this is Its
the worlds smallest violin
playing just for the waitresses

MR BLONDE
You dont have any idea what
youre talking about These
people bust their ass This
is a hard job

MR WHITE
Sos working at McDonalds but
you dont feel the need to tip
them Theyre servin ya food you
should tip em But no society
says tip these guys over here but
not those guys over there Thats
bullshit

MR ORANGE
They work harder than the kids at
McDonalds

MR WHITE
Oh yeah I dont see them cleaning
fryers

MR BROWN

These people are taxed on the tips
they make When you stiff â€˜em
you cost them money

MR BLONDE
Waitressing is the number one
occupation for female non-college
graduates in this country Its
the one jab basically any woman
can get and make a living on
The reason is because of tips

MR WHITE
Fuck all that
They all laugh

Everybody

MR WHITE
Hey Im very sorry that the
government taxes their tips
Thats fucked up But that aint
my fault it would appear that
waitresses are just one of the
many groups the government fucks
in the ass on a regular basis
You show me a paper says the
government shouldnt do that Ill
sign it Put it to a vote Ill
vote for it But what I wont do
is play ball And this non-
college bullshit youre telling
me I got two words for that
Learn to fuckin type Cause if
youre expecting me to help out
with the rent youre in for a big
fuckin surprise

MR ORANGE
Hes convinced me Give me my
dollar back

laughs Joes comes back to the table

JOE

rambling Wait a minute who

JOE

EXT UNCLE BOBS PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

CREDIT SEQUENCE

When the credit sequence is finished we FADE TO BLACK

Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
agony

Under the screaming we hear the sound of a car HAULING
ASS through traffic

Over the screams and the traffic noise we hear SOMEBODY

INT WAREHOUSE - DAY

The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse Then the
door swings open and Mr White carries the bloody body of
Mr Orange inside

Mr Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit

Mr White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor

MR WHITE
Just hold on buddy boy Hold on

Mr Orange lays his head back on the mattress Spent from
his outburst he quietly mutters to himself

Suddenly the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr
Pink steps inside

MR PINK
Was that a fucking set-up or what

Mr Pink sees Mr Orange on the floor shot and bloody

MR WHITE
Gun shot

(pause)
You havent thought about this

MR WHITE
I havent had a chance to think

move past it and see down a hall

INT BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY

At the end of the hall is a bathroom The bathroom door
is partially closed restricting our view Mr Pink is
obscured but Mr White is in view

MR PINK (OS)
What the fuck am I doing here I

burned buying weed I always knew

MR PINK
No real people

MR WHITE
Uh-uh just cops

MR PINK
Could you believe Mr Blonde

MR WHITE

fucking things Ive ever seen
Why the fuck would Joe hire
somebody like that

MR PINK
I dont wanna kill anybody But
if I gotta get out that door and

youre standing in my way one way

of the other youre gettin outta
my way
MR WHITE
Thats the way I look at it A
choice between doin ten years and
takin out some stupid
motherfucker aint no choice at
all But I aint no madman
either What the fuck was Joe
thinkin You cant work with a
guy like that That mother-
fuckers unstable What do you
think Do you think he panicked
or ya think hes just trigger-
happy

MR PINK
I think hes a sick fuckin maniac
Were awful goddamn lucky he
didnt tag us when
he shot up the place I came this
fucking close--

(hold up two fingers

and makes a tiny

space between them)
--to taking his ass out myself
Everybody panics When things get
tense everybody panics
Everybody I dont care what your
name is you cant help it Its
human nature But ya panic on the
inside
Ya panic in your head Ya give
yourself a couple a seconds of
panic then you get a grip and
deal with the situation What you
dont do is shoot up the place
and kill everybody

MR WHITE
What youre supposed to do is act
like a fuckin professional A
psychopath is not a professional
You cant work with a psychopath
cause ya dont know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next
I mean Jesus Christ how old do
you think that black girl was
Twenty maybe twenty-one

MR PINK
Did ya see what happened to
anybody else
MR WHITE
Me and Mr Orange jumped in the
car and Mr Brown floored it
After that I dont know what went
down

MR PINK
At that point it became every man
for himself As far as Mr Blonde
or Mr Blue are concerned I aint
got the foggiest Once
I got out I never looked back

MR WHITE
What do you think

MR PINK
What do I think I think the cops
caught them or killed em

MR WHITE
Not even a chance they punched
through You found a hole

MR PINK
Yeah and that was a fucking
miracle But if they did get
away where the fuck are they

MR WHITE
You dont think its possible one
of them got ahold of the diamonds
and pulled a--

MR PINK
Nope

MR WHITE
How can you be so sure

MR PINK
I got the diamonds

MR WHITE
Where

MR PINK
I got em all right

MR WHITE
Where Are they out in the car
MR PINK
No theyre not in the car No I
dont have them on me Ya wanna
go with me and get em Yes we
can go right now But first
listen to what Im telling you
We were fuckin set up Somebody
is in league with the cops We
got a Judas in our midst And Im
thinkin we should have our fuckin
heads examined for waiting around
here

MR WHITE
That was the plan we meet here

MR PINK
Then where is everybody I say
the plan became null and void once
we found out we got a rat in the
house We aint got the slightest
fuckin idea what happened to Mr
Blonde or Mr Blue They could
both be dead
or arrested They could be
sweatin em down at the station
house right now Yeah they dont
now the names but they can sing
about this place
mean that could be happening
right now As we speak the cops
could be in their cars drivin
here this minute

MR WHITE
I swear to god Im fuckin jinxed

MR PINK
What

MR WHITE
Two jobs back it was a four man
job we discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop

MR PINK
No shit

MR WHITE
Thank god we discovered in time
We hadda forget the whole fuckin
thing Just walked away from it

MR PINK
So whos the rat this time Mr
Blue Mr Blonde Joe Its
Joes show he set this whole
thing up Maybe he set it up to
set it up

MR WHITE
I dont buy it Me and Joe go
back a long time I can tell ya
straight up Joe definitely didnt
have anything to do with this

bullshit

MR PINK
Oh you and Joe go back a long
time I known Joe since I was a

kid But me saying Joe definitely
couldnt have done it is
ridiculous I can say I
definitely didnt do it cause I
know what I did or didnt do But
I cant definitely say that about
anybody else cause I dont
definitely know For all I know
youre the rat

MR WHITE
For all I know youre the rat

MR PINK
Now youre using your head For
all we know hes the rat

Mr Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr Orange Mr Whites
expression changes

MR WHITE
Jesus Christ

INT WAREHOUSE - DAY
They run over to Mr Orange whos unconscious The
CAMERA hovers over the action Mr Pink reaches him

first

MR PINK
Is he dead

Mr White pushes him out of the way He feels the pulse
on Mr Oranges neck

MR PINK
So is he dead or what

MR WHITE
He aint dead

MR PINK
So what is it

MR WHITE
I think hes just passed out

MR PINK

He scared the fuckin shit outta
me I thought he was dead fer
sure

Mr White stands up and walks over to a table
MR WHITE

He will be dead fer sure if we
dont get him to a hospital

MR PINK
We cant take him to a hospital

MR WHITE

Without medical attention this
man wont live through the night
That bullet in his belly is my
fault Now while that might not
mean jack shit to you it means a
helluva lot to me And Im not
gonna just sit around and watch
him die

MR PINK
Well first things first staying
heres goofy We gotta book up

MR WHITE

So what do you suggest we go toa
hotel We got a guy whos shot in
the belly he cant walk he
bleeds like a stuck pig and when
hes awake he screams in pain

MR PINK
You gotta idea spit it out
MR WHITE
Joe could help him If we can get
in touch with Joe Joe could get
him to a doctor Joe could get a
doctor to come and see him

During Mr Pinks dialog we slowly ZOOM in toa
CU of Mr White

MR PINK (OS)
Assuming we can trust Joe how we
gonna get in touch with him Hes
supposed to be here but he aint
which is making me nervous about
being here Even if Joe is
on the up and up hes probably
not gonna be that happy with us
Joe planned a robbery but hes
got a blood bath on his hands now
Dead cops dead robbers dead
civiliansJesus Christ I tend
to doubt hes gonna have a lot of
sympathy for our plight If I was
him Id try and put as much
distance between me and this mess
an humanly possible

MR WHITE
Before you got here Mr Orange
was askin me to take him to a
hospital Now I dont like
turning him over to the cops but
if we dont hes dead He begged
me to do it I told him to hold
off till Joe got here

MR PINK (OS)
Well Joe aint gettin here Were
on our own Now I dont know a
goddamn body who can help him so
if you know somebody call em

MR WHITE
I dont know anybody

MR PINK (OS)
Well I guess we drop him off at
the hospital Since he dont know
nothin about us I say its his
decision
MR WHITES POV
CU OF MR PINK

MR WHITE (OS)
Well he knows a little about me

MR PINK
You didnt tell him your name did

alley cats

As Mr White SWINGS and PUNCHES he SCREAMS

The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING
Mr White gets Mr Pink in a HEADLOCK

Mr Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun and pulls it

Mr White sees this immediately lets go of Mr Pink
and goes for his own weapon

The two men are on the floor on their knees with their
guns outstretched aiming at one another

MR WHITE

All right lets get to know one

tell one another your real name or
anything else about yourself
That includes where youre from
your wifes name where you
mightve done time about a bank
in St Petersburg you mightve
robbed You guys dont say shit
about who you are where you been
or what youve done Only thing
you guys can talk about is what
youre going to do This way the
only ones who know who the members
of the team are are Eddie and
myself And thats the way I like
it Because in the unlikely event
of one of you getting apprehended
by the cops not that I expect
that to happen - it most
definitely should not happen - it
hasnt happened you dont have
anything to deal with You dont
know any names You know my name
you know Eddies name That I

into this thing with your eyes
wide open so dont start screamin
blind man now I understand
youre nervous I wish the
warehouse had more visible
windows but it doesnt We have
to make do with the cards were
dealt

FREDDY
I didnt say I wasnt gonna do it
Im just remarking on how shitty
the situation is

HOLDAWAY
I dont mean to be harsh with ya
but Ive found tough love works
best in these situations We have
to get Joe Cabot in the company of
the thieves and in the same
vicinity as the loot
We dont care about these other
bastards Were willing to offer
them good deals to testify against
Cabot

FREDDY
Isnt this risk unorthodox

HOLDAWAY
What

FREDDY
Letting them go ahead with the
robbery

HOLDAWAY
The whole idea behind this
operation is to catch Joe Cabot
red-handed We bust these hired
hands we aint accomplished shit
Letting them go through with the
heist is a risk but Cabots jobs
are very clean We got people
surrounding the perimeter We got
a guy and a gal on the inside
posing as a couple shopping for
rings We could replace the
employees with cops but wed run
the risk of tipping em off

FREDDY
Thats out They know the faces
of who works what shift

HOLDAWAY
These guys are professionals
Were professionals Its a risk
but I think its a calculated
risk
