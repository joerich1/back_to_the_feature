1 EXT MOUNTAINS NEAR GENEVA SWITZERLAND - NIGHT

The snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full
moon A fortress-like CHATEAU is situated in a flat saddle of
forest partway up the mountain next to a frozen lake The
property is surrounded by high stone walls and the stately
grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards
with dogs

2 EXT CHATEAU - NIGHT

The driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars A formal-
dress party is in progress a private reception for a middle-
eastern dignitary Tuxedoes men escort their diamond-encrusted
ladies through the huge front doors where they doff their
overcoats and are politely scanned with hand-held metal
detectors by white gloved security staffers

The walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake forming
a kind of rampart There is an opening to a kind of waterway
or canal which connects to the private docks inside the
grounds There is a steel grating across the opening The
bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter

With the house visible BG we CRANE DOWN below the parapet wall
along which a guard is a white exposure-suit is walking down
along the dark wall to the grating TILTING DOWN to see a
glow pulsing under the ice

3 EXT BENEATH THE ICE UNDERWATER - NIGHT

Camera moving toward A FIGURE in diving gear working at the
metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch One bar has
already been cut out Two quick cuts and a second bar falls to
the muddy bottom Lit now only from the floodlights filtering
down through the ice the figure slips through the bars and
swims powerfully along the stone canal wall

Seem from below the figure is a black shadow moving against
the rippled-glass of the ice above

4 EXT CANAL AND BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

A dock extends into the frozen canal just behind a large

boathouse There is a faint chipping sound The ice breaks
quietly and the pieces are slid back A head appears ina
rubber drysuit hood The DIVER slips the regulator out of his
mouth and turns slowly scanning revealing

HARRY TASKER Our hero Harry floats with just his eyes above
the surface silent as a water snake as a guard passes on a
footpath nearby

After a few beats Harry slips out of his tanks and fins
letting them sink and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock
He moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse
Opening a WATERPROOF BAG he pulls out a walky talky

HARRY
Honey Im home

yellow snow and hurries back to the van They are parked on a

lights are visible through the trees

Faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto
nightvision scope The eerie green image lurches as he sweeps
the grounds locating the boathouse

6 EXT BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Concealed in the shadows Harry is shucking out of his drysuit
Underneath is he is wearing black tux pants suspenders

containing his 45 auto Glock-22 and the transmitter pack for
the ear-piece slung on the other He slips on a formal jacket
concealing the rig Then a final touch A little aftershave
from a tiny plastic vial

Harry adjusts his bow-tie and strides confidently out of the
shadows crossing quickly to the main house He looks
ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and
his hair slicked back He enters the main house through a back
service entrance

7 INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Harry strides through the huge kitchen like he owns the place

8 INT MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Here the party is in full swing Harry blends smoothly into
the crowd of foreign dignitaries businessman and minor mid-
east nobility They are a high-octane mixture of new oil money
and old European money and run the spectrum from stodgy
bankers to playboy arms dealers

Harry strolls amiably among the glittering woman the cigar
smoking men casually snagging a glass of champagne and a
canape from the passing waiters He nods to someone as if he
knows them Greets another is quite fluent Arabic People in
his wake look at each other like Do you know him They
shrug go on with their conversation Harry moves through the
crowd Scanning

HARRY
Theres Daddy Petrobucks

HARRYS POV - Through the crowd is sees JAMAL KHALED the host
of the party and owner of the chateau He is fat and animated
greeting guests with a flourish As Harry watches he warmly
greets a beautiful WOMAN They become absorbed in a
conversation

The woman glances up and sees Harry checking her out There is
a frank moment of returned interest Then the crowd shifts
cutting off their view of each other

connects it quickly to the modem port in the back of the
computer

HARRY

15 INT 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

TIGHT ON LIBRARY DOOR It opens a crack and a dental mirror

coast is clear Harry slips out But just as he is closing the
door a GUARD rounds the corner ten feet away Harry turns
smoothly He smiles sheepishly and moves toward the guard

HARRY
(In Arabic subtitled)
Wheres the john around here I

The guard points warily down the corridor Harry nods and
heads that way back toward the party

16 INT MAIN HALL STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Harry comes down the staircase amid the glitter of the party
He is sipping champagne and looking bored He sees two
security guys moving purposefully through the crowd toward the
stairs walkies in their hands He turns away as they pass him
and pretends to study a large fragment of bas-relief a
temple frieze depicting a war chariot drawn by four horses

He senses someone next to him and turns It is the WOMAN She
is captivatingly beautiful and her gaze is piercing

HARRY
(indicating the bas-
relief)

other guards who comes running over

GIB (VO)

crowd Harry turns smoothly away from them and takes Junos
arm

HARRY

He steers her toward the dance floor

Harry

22 INT MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Harry whirls Juno aggressively across the dancefloor She
responds deftly They are well matched She parries each of
his smooth moves with a flourish It is a contest of wills
and a surprised appraisal for each that the other is worthy
Juno is hot He bends her back at the waist then snaps her
up She twirls into the crook of his arm Their faces are
inches apart Wow The music ends and she gives him a wry
grin

JUNO
Well And I thought this was
going to be just another bunch of
boring bankers and oil
billionaires

GIB (OVER)
Harry seconds count buddy
Ditch the bitch lets go

HARRY
Unfortunately Juno I have a

Harry nods to the security men at the door as he strides
confidently through He goes down the steps to the broad
terrace above the motor court Behind Harry a GUARD lowers
his walky talky and starts after him

GUARD

Without turning Harry slips a small flat box out of his breast
pocket A REMOTE DETONATOR

HARRY

He pushes the button and--

KABOOM The second floor office windows blow out in a fiery
explosion Using the diversion Harry leaps off the terrace
before the guard can open fire

25 INT EXT VAN - NIGHT

van

GIB
Aw shit Here we go--

26 EXT CHATEAU AND GROUNDS - NIGHT

Harry sprints across the snow-covered lawn through the trees
Guards with automatic weapons run after him firing The snow
explodes around him with bullet hits

TWO DOBERMANS pelt toward Harry leaping at him in perfect
unison He waits and knocks their heads together in mid-
leap with a crack like a baseball bat The dogs drop to the
snow wobbling around like theyre drunk

As Harry sprints on ANOTHER DOBERMAN lunges out of the bushes
ahead leaping directly for his throat Harry grabs the dog
and shot-puts him up into a tree without breaking stride Dog
Fu The dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch
looking down in amazement

27 EXT PERIMETER WALL MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

Harry leaps down on the outside of the wall hitting a snow
bank and sliding downhill He sprints down the gentle slope
toward the highway

Harry looks back as TWO GUARDS ON SKIS come out of a guard
station beside the main entrance

TRACKING WITH THE SKI-GUARDS searching through the trees with
lights They have lost Harry They stop A snowbank behind

them EXPLODES as Harry leaps out He disables them both with

vicious street-fighter moves Harry looks upslope as--

A service gate opens in the perimeter wall and TEAMS OF
SECURITY MEN in white snow-suits pour out some on skis some
on SNOWMOBILES A HELICOPTER rises over the wall in a blast of
swirling snow Its xenon lights rake through the trees
casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow

ON Harry snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one
of the disabled guards He pops the boots quickly into the
bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guards FN FAL
rifles slung across his back

The helicopter swoops downhill its searchlight blazing through
the forest Snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski-patrols
zig-zagging among the trees

Harry slashes expertly downhill He cuts a distinguished
figure in his black tux Automatic weapons fire rips through
the trees from behind him Harry is going flat-out The xenon
light hits him A 762 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the
slope into white clouds around him Harry slashes turns
weaving among the trees at breakneck speed A snowmobile is
closing in outflanking him He turns toward it suddenly
Hits a mogul Uses the air to slash his skis right across the
riders face The snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the
night

28 INT EXT VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT
GIBS VAN takes an icy turn in a hairy slide

INSIDE Gib is peering upslope trying to see whats going on
All he can see are lights and gunfire

GIB
Harry whats your twenty I
need a position buddy--

Suddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from
the slope above RIGHT OVER THE VAN and lands deftly
downslope

GIB
Uh right Ill catch you on
the next bend

Behind the van pursuing guards leap across the road Only
about half can make the jump The rest crash horribly The
helicopter thunders overhead

29 EXT MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

Harry sees the chopper start an attack run He comes out into
the open going straight downhill like a rocket The chopper
gets suckered in trying to hit him getting right down
behind him and suddenly-- Harry slides to a stop in an
explosion of powder and whips up the rifle P-P-P-POW He
rakes a burst across the windshield The startled pilot
swerves and-- Suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front
of him

K-WHACK The main-rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper
drops into the snow plowing into a snowbank It slides right
to the edge of a steep ridge and stops teetering

Firing from a snowmobile one of the guards puts a burst right
across Harrys path Harrys skis are hit and he tumbles

comes out of it running down the hill like a juggernaut in
his heavy boots He has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow

Harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed
chopper which still has its engine running The ski patrol
opens fire from upslope Rounds whacking against the disabled
helicopter

Harry looks down the slope and gets an idea He jerks the
unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage rocking it

It slips over the edge He leaps inside as it topples forward
and slides down the slope

30 INT EXT HELICOPTER - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

Harry adds throttle and works the footpedals using the tail-
rotor to steer The chopper had snow-skids and Harry is
skiing the damn thing down the mountain

The copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its
skids Bullets are hitting the fuselage and everything around
it Skiers are wiping out hitting trees A snowmobile hits

a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine

GIB (OVER)
Harry Where are you

HARRY
In the helicopter

31 INT EXT VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT
Gib slides the van around a curve

GIB
(deadpan to Faisil)
Hes in the helicopter

Big is scanning above for the chopper Then upslope he sees
the burning fuselage skiing expertly among the trees

The chopper hits a jump and launches into the air-- It crashes
through trees still soaring and-- Gib looks up screaming as--
The chopper drops right toward him-- He hits the brakes and--
BLAMMO It drops onto the road ten feet in front of the
skidding van then slides over the edge and tumbles into a
rocky canyon where is BLOWS UP The fireball lights up the
night

Gib and Faisil jump out of the van They look downslope at the
burning wreckage

GIB
Harry HARRY

HARRY
What
Gib and Faisil spin to look behind them Harry is lodged in
tree-branches hanging over the road Gib hands his MP-5K
machine gun to Faisil and reaches up to Harry who grabs his
hand and pulls Harry tumbles down into the snowbank He
stands brushing snow off his tux and clomps toward the van in
his ski-boots He is completely unruffled

HARRY
Lets go We can still make our
flight

As Faisil is getting into the van behind Harry TWO GUARD TEAMS
ON SNOWMOBILES roar around the bend behind them fish-tailing
on the ice Faisil OPENS FIRE One snowmobile swerves over
the embankment The other pulls up broadside and the guards
duck behind it Gib floors it and the van roars down the
mountain Faisil is still Ramboing on full-auto

quietly down the hall He pauses at a door with lurid labels

unflawed

rushing to get ready herself We get our first good look at
Helen She is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an
outfit Her hair is wrapped in a towel To call her plain

effort into it which doesnt occur to her

HARRY

have been together a long time do

HELEN
Howd it go at the trade show

DEFENSE

They enter a high-tech office space It is a maze of glass
partitions surrounding a central floor-space of cubicles
There is a hushed quality here People do not joke They do
not hurry There are a lot of computer screens displaying
information from around the world It looks like a combination
of NASA mission control and FBI headquarters

cubicle

56 INT JUNOS OFFICES - DAY

HARRY
--corporate art consulting
company in San Francisco I have
an appointment with Ms Skinner--

Harry is extending his business card to the receptionist as
Juno breezes into the lobby from a corridor She is dressed
sharply and looks as stunning as Harry remembers

JUNO
Harry I thought I might see you
again I just didnt except you
to call so soon

Juno lingers a second or so long on the handshake

HARRY
Well whats the point of
waiting

JUNO
I agree

There is definitely unholy magnetism here She indicates for
Harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of
offices There are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in
niches on either side and beautifully restored mosaics and
tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls

JUNO
So your clients want something
for the lobby of their new
corporate headquarters

HARRY
Thats right They want
something dramatic I spoke

to a number of people who said
youre the one to see

Juno leads Harry through a door into a large warehouse area
There is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates An
overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces There are
massive columns and statues two stories high Even the entire
facade of a tomb

JUNO
So what did these people
say about me exactly

They stroll amongst the statues as coveralled workmen move
around them with tools scaffolding pneumatic equipment Most
of the workers are middle-eastern

HARRY
Lets see that you can read
ancient Sanskrit without having
to sound out the words And that
other dealers and archeologists
dont like you much

JUNO

Those wimps Its because I use
my diplomatic contacts to export
cultural treasures from countries
which tell them to take a hike

(yelling in Arabic to

two workmen)
I told you to move those crates
an hour ago Come on guys lets
get going

We realize that A WORKMAN is watching them intently from
nearby He is an intense looking MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN in his mid-
thirties
JUNO
You see a lot of these pieces
are from ancient Persia
Unfortunately ancient Persia is
twenty feet under the sand of
Iran Iraq and Syria Not the
most popular places lately So
Ive had to become an expert in
international diplomacy

Juno stops and looks at Harry Her smile indicates the
possibility of more than just business

JUNO
Well do you see anything you
like Mr Renquist

gaze She nods and they go into the private office

59 INT JUNOS OFFICE - DAY

MALIK comes in behind her and closes the door The moment they
are away from public observation his manner changes His
humble posture straightens and his eyes flash intensely as he
approaches her Without warning he SLAPS HER HARD ACROSS THE
FACE

MALIK
You stupid undisciplined bitch

Her jaw clenches but her reaction is surprisingly submissive

JUNO
Its a good thing you pay me
well

MALIK

Do you realize that there are
surveillance teams watching this
place right now Your phones are
almost certainly tapped And you
are busy laughing and flirting
like a whore with this Renquist

JUNO
No He checked out okay--

Malik slaps her again

MALIK
That is for interrupting

toward the back of the warehouse and then leaves Harry is

Only a few lights are on rendering the place somewhat Gothic
Harry strolls in the direction the workman pointed Ahead of
him is the huge facade of a royal tomb There is a flickering
light inside A shadow moves across the wall in the entryway

HARRY
Hello

He enters the stone doorway of the tomb FOLLOWING HARRY as he
steps into the inner chamber There is an oil-lamp burning on
a stone sarcophagus the only light The room appears empty

REVERSE ON HARRY Behind him a figure emerges from a shadowed
alcove It is Juno She looks ethereal in the strange light

JUNO

I love this place I love all

ruins

HARRY

Juno turns to him in the flickering half-light She moves
closer Her eyes seem to glitter

JUNO

someone who gets what she wants

She is very close to him Her eyes seem to glitter in the
light from the oil lamp She is unbelievably beautiful

Juno picks up the lamp and walks along the wall holding it up
so that the flickering shadows seem to bring the bas-relief
figures to life Stone faces shift and change stone eyes
move

JUNO
Look at this People who dies
twenty centuries ago

Juno presses her cheek against the cold stone She runs her
fingers slowly across the figures It is strange and erotic

JUNO
They breathed and loved and wept
just like us And now their
ideals their religions their
social orders are gone like
mist What did any of it matter

She crosses to Harry

JUNO
I only hope they lived well
That they got what they wanted

Harry cant answer because Mahmoud just entered the room behind
him Harry is at one of the urinals apparently taking a leak
Mahmoud goes to the mirror Starts combing his hair He
doesnt much notice the pack of Camels sitting on the counter
nearby Harry is whistling Shaking himself

HARRYS POV - In the video glasses Harry sees himself and

Mahmoud Yusif comes into the restroom seemingly ignoring
both Harry and Mahmoud as if heading for the stalls As he
passes behind Harry he reaches into his coat--

Harry spins lightning fast He knocks away the SILENCED PISTOL
aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block capturing
Yusifs arm in an arm-lock The shot goes wide shattering a

urinal

Harry slams his palm into Yusifs face like a piledriver and
spins him against the steel stalls The silenced pistol goes
skittering across the floor

Mahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband Still holding the
bear-like Yusif Harry draws his Glock so fast we can barely
see him move BLAM BLAM BLAM Three 45 slugs go through
Mahmouds chest shattering the mirror behind him He flops on
his butt slumping against the wall

Yusif who is easily Harrys size bellows and grabs his gun
arm They smash against the walls struggling for the gun
Yusif locked to Harry hurls him against the stalls They hit
a locked door which pops open banging inward

Yusif drives Harry to the floor Harrys head is between the
shoes of an OLD GUY sitting on the can who looks down
uncomprehendingly at him

if slams Harrys gun hand repeatedly against the doorframe
the stall He twists Harrys wrist brutally He even

ounds against Harrys hand with his knee The old guy winces
hats got to hurt Harry cries out in pain and the gun drops
usif reaches for it but Harry kicks it under the stalls

us

KHOOK

He punches Yusif in the face driving him back They grapple

spinning Harry drives Yusifs head into the counter Then he
elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy

floor Harry grabs Yusifs hair and pounds his face repeatedly
against the rim of a urinal In case you havent noticed this
is a messy nasty fight Survival is like that

Yusif sags into submission Harry pulls a nylon zip-strip out
of his pocket and uses it like hand-cuffs securing Yusifs
wrists

83 EXT MALL - NIGHT

Gib is running full out drawing his gun He has one finger
jammed in his ear His gut is doing the rumba as he runs

GIB
Harry Harry you copy Shit

84 INT RESTROOM - NIGHT

Harry is pulling Yusif to his feet when the door bangs open
behind him He turns thinking it is Gib Its not Malik
raises a FULL-AUTO BERETTA 92-F and opens fire Harry spins
Yusif between him and the machine pistol Yusifs beer-keg
body stops the spray of 9mm slugs form hitting Harry long
enough for him to dive into a stall

Malik hoses the room with the Beretta The metal stalls are
riddled with hits

HARRY is in the stall with the old guy whos just sitting
there The walls of the stall are pimpling with the hits on
the far side Harry reaches under the stall retrieving his
Glock

MALIK goes empty Harry hears that and pops out cranking off
rounds--—

Malik is a blur going out the door as Harrys shots shatter
tiles on the doorframe Then silence

HARRY
(to the old guy)
Sorry

MOVING WITH MALIK who backs rapidly away from the restroom
reloading

GIB (OFF)
FREEZE

Malik spins to see Gib nearby going into a firing stance
behind a light-standard The terrorist doesnt hesitate His
Beretta ROARS at 900 rounds per minute

Gib tries to hide behind the light-standard which is about
half as wide as he is Shots hit all around him shattering
window glass behind him His stomach sticks out from behind
the pole He sucks it in Now his butt is sticking out on the
other side Shots clang into the steel column and riddle
everything behind him

GIB
WRONG THIS IS NOT GOOD

Just when it looks like Gib is going to get a 9mm tummy tuck
Malik turns and sprints away through shocked pedestrians
Harry runs out of the restroom trying for a shot but there
are too many people in the line of fire and Malik knows it
HARRY
Get back to the car

Gib nods and heads the other way as Harry takes off after
Malik Malik is fast and vicious He hurls people out of the
way sending shoppers sprawling Harry is ruthless in his
pursuit They pound through the mall and out onto the street--

86 EXT STREET - NIGHT

Malik sprints straight into traffic A car screeches not
stopping in time Malik goes right over the hood Harry
leaps over the hoods of cars after him Malik sees Harry
coming after him like a juggernaut

He turns and sees a MOTORCYCLIST coming down the street
accelerating from a right-turn Malik runs at him clothes-
lining him right off the bike The terrorist picks up the
nimble little Kawasaki 250 which is still running and leaps
on He pops the clutch and takes off Harry pounds after him
like a locomotive He sees Malik turn taking the bike path
into a large PARK Harry cuts into the park on a diagonal

can get his gut out of the holster to stop him

MALIK roars through the park on the Kawasaki He looks back
amazed to see Harry charging after him on a horse They
scatter joggers and bicyclists people walking their dogs

TRACKING WITH THEM as they rocket through the park Malik
leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees
Harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling

Acres of marble and red carpet Liveries porters Guests
dressed for evening the men in suits diamonds on the women
And sudden pandemonium as Malik roars through the lobby with
Harry charging along behind him Malik guns it across the
lounge knocking over tables He gets air at the top of the
steps going up to the RESTAURANT

Harry swerves to avoid a panicking guest and finds himself
careening toward the JAZZ QUARTET at a full gallop He gathers
the animal and LEAPS (in glorious SLOW MOTION) over the
bassist who is diving for the carpet Harry and horse land
deftly and then he urges his mount right up the steps after
Malik

Malik as the doors close

96 INT SCENIC ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Harry canters the horse into the next elevator which has just
been boarded by an older couple He has to practically lie
down on the horse to fit through the door The animal barely
fits nose to tail in what turns out to be--

A GLASS ELEVATOR with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel
as it rises right to the top of the building Harry looks
through the glass at the elevator car next to him fifteen feet
away Malik is inside punching a button He glances up and
sees Harry There eyes meet for a moment just before Maliks
car ascends rapidly Maliks malevolent glare is etched on
Harrys retinas

The older couple is jammed against the side-wall by Harrys
panting snorting horse It clomps around the tight elevator
The woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall

HARRY
Can you just press the top floor
please

The man nods mutely and complies Their elevator takes off
rising after Maliks

Harry has slid off the horse to get next to the control panel
He can look up at an angle and see Malik in the car above him
His thumb hovers over the emergency stop button If Malik gets
out at any floor Harry will have a moment to react and stop
Malik can look down and see this He knows Harrys got him

He just keeps going floor after floor using the time to
think

The older woman is still just staring trying not to breathe
The horse flicks her in the face with his tail

99 INT EXT ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The rooftop has a spectacular view of the city TRACKING WITH
Malik as he comes out of the elevator rides to the far edge of
the roof and slides to a stop He looks down twenty stories

THE SECOND ELEVATOR arrives The doors part and Harry comes
out with his Glock poised and ready He sees Malik revving
his bike The terrorist brodies the bike into a fast one-
eighty and speeds back toward the edge of the roof Amazingly
he increases speed ROARING RIGHT OFF THE EDGE ARCING THE
BIKE SUICIDALLY OUT INTO SPACE

Harry rides to the edge in time to see Malik on his bike
CLEAR A 60 FOOT JUMP and SPLASH INTO THE ROOFTOP POOL of a
LOWER BUILDING next to the hotel

Harry is out of control now seeing the guy setting away He
wheels his mount and charges across the roof to get some
running space Then he turns again back toward the edge Malik
jumped from He kicks the horses flanks and yells HAAHH

The horses hoofs thunder on the roof as they go full tilt
toward the edge

But a horse is not a motorcycle It is slightly smarter It
slams its front hoofs down together stopping suddenly Harry
goes right over its head He flies forward almost going right
off the roof He slams to the edge with his legs dangling
over holding onto a piece of pipe with one hand His Glock
tumbles down into darkness

Harry sees Malik far below climb out of the pool running to
the roof door of the other building Getting away Harry
clambers up onto his own roof breathing hard

to the horse

HARRY

get away

He looks into the horses innocent brown eyes

fondly

HARRY

earlier Soft tenor sax flows around the room Helen enters
the BATHROOM and shuts the door partway She opens a cupboard
and quickly pulls out some things she hid there earlier A
bottle of champagne on ice Two glasses Some trashy
lingerie

HARRY

brush your teeth

HELEN

HARRY

I couldnt believe it I go back

Helen is hurrying to put on the unfamiliar lingerie G-string
panties and low-cut bra She holds up the garter belt turning
it backward and forward trying to figure out which way it
goes

ON HARRY yawning Lying with the ease of years of practice

HARRY

front of her panties

HELEN

Helen quickly pours two glasses of champagne Then she slinks
around the doorframe making her entrance She looks like a
living 900 number Helen stands before the bed looking down
holding the champagne glasses
ON HARRY sprawled on the bed fully clothed snoring softly
A little bit of drool is coming out the side of his mouth

HOLD ON HELEN all dressed up with no place to go She gazes
down at him her shoulders slumping

HELEN
Happy Birthday Harry

She sighs deeply and downs her champagne in one long gulp

release The promise of
adventure A hint of danger I
create that for them

HARRY

eyed He could kill Simon with one punch Hes visualizing
his wife getting porked by this guy

HARRY
But with you she gets to be hot

SIMON

They laugh together Harrys laugh is getting a bit brittle
He speeds up his knuckles white on the wheel Now for the big

seconds Then hes back to selling He scrambles out and goes
around to Harry coughing in the cloud of tire smoke

You see what I mean That
reaction would give us away ina

Its just that its been
sixteen years since anyone but
Harry did that I--

SIMON

herself not pulling away He lowers her slowly until they are
lying together on the bed

There you go Thats right

He slides his hand up her thigh The fingers stroking in
little circles slips under her skirt And--

She suddenly EXPLODES pushing on his chest forcing him up off

She sprints through the trees Harry pounding after her He
grabs her and gets her in a headlock She bites the hell out
of his arm Harry yells and lets her go just as-- Keough runs
up and matter-of-factly clips her on the head with his weapon
Standard operating procedure Which is why he cant understand

something

HARRY

What did you need

HELEN

I needed to feel alive I wanted
to do something outrageous
And I dont know it felt
good to be needed To be
trusted To be special

In verbalizing it she just feels smaller more pathetic that
she ever did She hates the unseen voices for making for try
to explain her deepest unvoiced needs

HELEN

Theres so much I wanted to do in
this life and its like I
havent done any of it And the
sands running out of the
hourglass I want to be able to
look back and say See I did
that It was wild and it was
reckless and outrageous and I

muzzle right in front of Simons eyes

SIMON

-- faint Aahhh Dont kill me

Harry is finally sickened by his grovelling He pulls Simon
away from the edge then gestures with his gun

HARRY

SIMON
No Soon as I turn youll shoot

Harry starts back to the truck Simon stays right with him
facing him terrified to turn away Like a dog following him

SIMON
Please dont You can have the
car for free--

microphone belting out a punchy cover of the old Cream classic

out to be her dad Her heart stops

DANA

221 EXT WAREHOUSE - DAY
Harry appears through the doors marching Dana by the arm He
walks her over to some industrial junk nearby overgrown with
weeds and sits her down for a talk

She is sullen still mortified from getting dragged out in
front of her friends

changes Dana Youre going to
start following some rules And
Im going to be there to see that

DANA

HARRY

doesnt He becomes very tender He pushes the hair back from
her face

HARRY

first met

She looks up at him puzzled

HARRY
You were quite young at the time
All wet and still attached to
your mom by a cord You opened
your eyes and looked right at me
And I knew then I would always
love you with all my heart

Dana stares at her father with a dawning awareness This is
not just some chump that she has to put up with This is her
father He is a part of her No matter what happens they are
in this thing together Tears start to run down her cheeks
HARRY
Somewhere along the way I got
lost honey I forgot about what

the moment purify him

sight behind the chair-arm as he manipulates the pause button

on the DAT tape deck

HELEN
Im Michelle Carlas sick She
thought you might like me so --

Harry goes SSSSHHHH Silencing her gently He silently clicks
off the PAUSE button The DAT recorder plays Charles Boyer
deep and hypnotic speaks from Harrys outline Harry
lipsynchs

HARRY (TAPE)
Let me do the talking You are
very pretty You may start by
unzipping your dress

PAUSE button She starts to yank the zipper down
HARRY (TAPE)
No no Do it slowly Very

slowly

Helen turns her back to him and draws the zipper down
languorously revealing her creamy back She is not wearing a
bra

HARRY (TAPE)
Now slip the dress down
slowly

Helen is starting to get into the ritual She lets the dress
slip off her shoulders It slides down her body to the floor
She steps out of it still in high heels

HARRY (TAPE)
Now slide the nylons off one by
one

HELEN
(puzzled)
Im not wearing any

Harry winces He starts the next line immediately

HARRY (TAPE)
Thats good Now the panties

The ritual continues as she strips slowly (this will be
tastefully done) She conceals the bugging device in her hand
as she sets her clothes on the bed near the phone Helen is
still concentrating on her mission

HARRY (TAPE)

Now turn cheri in the
moonlight Let your body flow
like water

She turns Her skin is beautiful in the silvery light

HARRY (TAPE)
Now dance for me Go on

Helen has no idea what to do but she improvises quite well
The scrutiny of the shadowed man who is fully clothed and her
raw vulnerability are a quiveringly powerful erotic
combination

HARRY (TAPE)
Let your hands be a lovers hands
on your own skin as you move
Yes thats it

TIGHT ON Harrys eyes as he studies her His game meant to
give her a dangerous fantasy is actually turning him on
mightily He is amazed to see her playing the role getting
into it This is not the Helen is thought he knew for sixteen
years

HARRY (TAPE)
Now lie on the bed and close
your eyes

She does Harry rises and goes to her bringing the tape deck

HARRY (TAPE)
Keep them closed Do not open
them

He sits on the bed next to her but without touching her He
strokes her hair lovingly Then runs his fingertips over her
eyes down her cheeks To her it feels delicate and delicious
Part of her is enjoying this a lot But Helen is torn between
wanting to flee and knowing that nothing the man has done so
far is enough to cause her to abort her mission

HELEN
I thought you only liked to
watch

Harry goes SSSHHH Its all he can do He bends over her and

brings his lips slowly down to her He touches them to hers so
slowly that she barely knows he is kissing her Then he takes

her in a passionate kiss

And she grabs the lamp on the bedside table and SMASHES IT OVER
HIS HEAD Harry flies off onto the floor groaning and
semiconscious

Helen flips on the light and grabs her clothes starting to
dress rapidly She still doesnt recognize Harry who is face
down He groans and starts to rise She kicks him in the ribs
and finishes putting her dress on She sticks the bug under
the night table and grabs her shoes Mission accomplished
motherfuckers

Harry grabs her ankle She raises one shoe to kosh him again
and sees who it is Freezeframe Total shock She cant even
form the question

HELEN
Harry--
234 INT SUITE DOOR - NIGHT

CRASH The door lock is shattered by tremendous force and
THREE MEN burst into the room We may recognize them as
workers from Junos shop They are wielding pistols and are
clearly part of Maliks terrorist brigade

Harry is still groggy and he doesnt want to start anything
with Helen there and risk her getting shot He acquiesces as
they pull him to his feet

HELEN
Hes got nothing to do with this

HARRY
(to lead TERRORIST)
Let the hooker go Shes not

HELEN
Harry be quiet Let me handle

LEAD TERRORIST

During this exchange the thugs have handcuffed Harrys hands
behind his back The leader gestures to one of the men to
bring Helen along Helen and Harry are dragged roughly out of
the room with pistol-muzzles stuck in their ribs

235 INT STAIRWELL - NIGHT

The door from the corridor bangs open and the thugs hustle
Harry and Helen down the fire-escape stairs

HELEN
That was unnecessary

A stairwell door opens and the terrorists rush Harry and Helen
through the basement labyrinth

A pistol muzzle is jammed hard behind Helens ear

They are hustled across a loading dock to a RENTAL VAN waiting
with the door open A fourth terrorist slides the van door
shut after they get in and gets in behind the wheel The van
takes off

238 EXT AIRPORT - NIGHT

The rental van pulls up to a G-3 JET warming up outside a
private hanger The van doors open and the hostages are
brought out Harry sees a long black LIMO pulling up behind
the van The driver an enormous man names AKBAR hurries to
open the passenger door A slender pair of ankles emerge
followed by the rest of Juno Skinner looking devastatingly
beautiful but now quite sinister

To Helen it is like a living James Bond film with the jet the
limo the terrorists and now an exotic femme fatale dressed
to kill approaching them

JUNO
(with a wry smile)
Hello Harry

HARRY
Juno I wish I could say its a
pleasure to see you again

Juno signals with her eyes and the terrorists march the
prisoners toward the plane

HELEN

AKBAR and the other terrorists push Helen and Harry into seats
and strap them in

HELEN

HARRY
(looking at Helen
contemptuously)
I dont know what this crazy

HELEN
Oh yeah Oh yeah Then where

Helen grabs the locket dangling on a chain around her neck
and opens it to show Juno

THE PICTURE IN THE LOCKET -- Harry and Helen together smiling

Harry roles his eyes Great Helen A FLIGHT HOSTESS walks up
carrying a tray Juno smiles graciously at Helen

JUNO
Something before take-off

The hostess whips a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR off the tray and zaps
Helen in the shoulder

HELEN
Oooowww That hurt You biii--

She slumps Juno looks at Harry

JUNO

Juno nods and the hostess zaps Harry He slides into
unconsciousness as the plane engines begin to SCREAM

240 EXT AIRPORT - NIGHT

The G-3 lifts into the night sky turning south

241 EXT PIER - NIGHT

A small FREIGHTER is tied up to a half-crumbling pier Next to
the pier is a dilapidated corrugated-metal warehouse building
two stories high There are floodlights on the dock but beyond
is black night with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms
It is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island
in the Caribbean

There is a lot of activity Three U-RENT TRUCKS are parked by
the warehouse as well as some other vehicles About thirty
men clearly CRIMSON JIHAD TERRORISTS are busy at various
activities Many of them carry AK47 assault rifles

MALIK is supervizing them as they finish unloading a tarp-
covered object about 15 feet high from the ship A rusting
gantry crane trundles it into the warehouse Malik looks up as
an AEROSPATIALE HELICOPTER thunders toward them over the black
Caribbean water

The helicopter lands and Juno steps down from the front door
The sliding door is opened and Akbar and the others pull a
groggy Harry and Helen out of the aircraft They are covered
by hoods

Malik walks up to them and pulls their hoods off Harry takes
in his surroundings and looks back into the eyes of Malik
Lethal energy flows between them

MALIK
Who is this woman

JUNO
His wife

MALIK
(seeing the
possibilities)
His wife Good Bring them

242 INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Malik leads the entourage into the warehouse where brilliant
floodlights illuminate--

THREE HUGE STONE FIGURES lined up in the middle of the space
The tarp is removes from the object they just unloaded
revealing a FOURTH STATUE The figures are cracked and
obscured by centuries but they are unmistakably warriors
mounted on horseback The legs and arms are missing on some
but the massive heads and necks remain
JUNO
Incredible arent they Warrior
figures from the Persian Empire
of Darius the First around 500
BC I call them The Four
Horsemen

She approaches the nearest figure caressing its flank A man
with a jackhammer steps up to her

JUNO
Theyre absolutely priceless

She shrugs and nods to the man with the jackhammer He blasts
right into the body of one of the Horseman destroying it
Stone fragments fall away revealing a cavity cut with great
precision inside the figure

Inside is a BRIGHT METAL CONTAINER Four terrorists pull it
out and set it on the ground It is six feet long and coffin-
like Malik steps up to it his eyes glistening A hush has
fallen over the group

MALIK
Open it

The latches are released and the lid lifted Inside is
machined metal object roughly conical about five feet long
Malik signals to Harry to step closer and look

MALIK
Do you know what this is

HARRY
Can you give me a clue It could
be a water heater for all I know

Malik grabs Helen jerking her roughly forward He whips out
a knife and inserts the point under Helens jaw forcing her
head back and drawing blood

MALIK
Do you know why you have been
brought here

HELEN
N-no
MALIK
So that this man can verify to
the world that Crimson Jihad is
now a nuclear power

HELEN
How can Harry do that Hes a
salesman for chrissakes

MALIK

If we were wrong about him
then the last thing you see will
be your blood spraying in his
face

Harry steps forward his face grim

HARRY

This is a Soviet MIRV-Six from
an SS-22N launch vehicle The
warhead contains 145 kilos of
enriched uranium with a
plutonium trigger The nominal
yield is 10 kilotons

(in Arabic subtitled)
Release her and Ill cooperate

Malik lowers the knife from her jaw He turns away from her
like she has ceased to exist and yells at the terrorists to
remove the other weapons Jackhammers tear into the stone
figures

Helen is just staring at Harry her mouth open He turns to
her not knowing what to say He shrugs sheepishly

HARRY
What can I say Ima spy

She just looks at him for a long time She moves closer
staring and staring letting it sink in Then she hauls off
and slugs him right in the jaw so hard is almost knocks him
down

HELEN
You bastard You lying son of
a bitch

Terrorists grabs her and restrain her She starts to cry
HARRY
Im sorry honey

HELEN
Dont call me honey You dont
ever get to call me honey again
You understand You pig

Juno looks at them both and laughs She offers Helen a tissue

JUNO
Here you go dear

NEARBY Akbar is going through the contents of Helens handbag
and Harrys wallet He rips open the bottom stitching and
pulls out the geo-positioning transmitter

AKBAR
Abu Look at this

Malik looks at the tracker and then smashes it to the floor
Helen looks at the crushed transmitter She stares at Harry
with dawning realization

HELEN
You bugged me

Juno cracks up at this

243 INT CITATION JET - NIGHT

The jet has become a mobile tactical-command center with Gib
Faisil and several other agents working out of portable
equipment cases Faisil looks up from a computer screen
suddenly

HARRY

The camera swings off Harry to Malik standing before the rest
of the Jihad warriors who are assembled behind the four bombs

MALIK
You have killed our women and
children bombed our cities from
afar like cowards and dare to
call us terrorists--

Over the image of Malik a LOW-BATTERY warning begins to flash

CUT TO SCENE as Malik speaks into the camera which is head by
one of his men The CAMERAMAN is sweating wondering if he
should interrupt He gulps nervously as Malik drones on

MALIK

-- But now the Oppressed have
been given a mighty sword to
strike back at their enemies
Unless the US pulls all military
forces out of the Persian Gulf
area immediately and forever
Crimson Jihad will rain fire on
one major US city each week until
these demands are met

BACK TO VIEWFINDER IMAGE BATTERY warning flashing faster

MALIK
First one weapon will be
detonated on this uninhabited
island as a demonstration of
Crimson Jihads power and our
willingness to be humanitarian
However if there demands are not--

In a burst of static the image GOES BLACK

The cameraman nervously lowers the camera ashen faced
Maliks eyes are black with murder

CAMERAMAN

MALIK
Get another one you moron

245 INT BUILDING - NIGHT

A filthy crumbling cinderblock building (near the warehouse)
A few bare light bulbs with bugs zipping around then and no
glass in the windows Harry and Helen are brought in by two
TERRORIST GUARDS Juno follows then into the bleak room
Guards shackle them to steel chairs with handcuffs

A MAN enters the room carrying a small suitcase He has skull-
like features He opens the suitcase and Harry has a good view
of the contents medical instruments needle-probes drills
Dremel tools with saw blades

JUNO

JUNO
Samir is just going to ask Harry
a few questions See were not
even sure which agency Harry
works for Now Samir is
absolutely first class but on
the other hand we have Harry
here who has managed to lie
convincingly to the woman he
loves for 15 years So it will
be interesting to see how long he
can resist

SAMIR
(holding up a syringe)
This will help

Samir injects Harry in the arm with the syringe

HARRY
You know you should swab that
with alcohol I might get an
infection

SAMIR
Ill return when this has taken
effect Then well talk

HARRY
Im looking forward to it

Samir exits

HARRY
Why are you helping these raving
psychotics

JUNO

Because theyre very well-funded
raving psychotics and Im
getting a lot of money

She kneels down in front of Harry stroking his leg

JUNO
You think I care about their
cause Or yours Not at all
See America is on top now

but so was Rome once All
civilizations crumble One
nation succeeding over another
What does it mean in the long
run The only important thing is
to live well And living
well takes money

HARRY
Youre damaged goods lady

Harrys words are beginning to be slightly slurred The drugs
are taking effect

JUNO
(indicating Helen)
Did you tell her about us Harry

HARRY
There is no us you psychotic
bitch

JUNO

Sure Say that now

Juno puts her arms around him and kisses him passionately She
breaks looking at Helen to savor the effect Helen is
trembling with rage

JUNO
Thanks for everything Harry It
was good while it lasted

Juno crosses to the guard and takes a hand-grenade off his
belt Then she goes to Helen and places it between her knees
She pushes Helens knees together to hold the spoon against the
grenade then pulls the pin

JUNO
Now just keep your knees
together and youll be fine

HELEN
Something you obviously have a
hard time doing

JUNO
Hold that thought
Juno leaves Harry looks dopily at Helen

HARRY
There was nothing I swear

Helen doesnt believe him and why should she She looks up
from staring at the grenade to see that Harrys head has
slumped forward

HELEN
What did he give you

HARRY

(groggy)
Sodium amytal maybe some other
truth agent

HELEN
It makes you tell the truth

HARRY
Yes

HELEN
Is it working yet

HARRY
Ask me a question I would
normally lie to

HELEN
Are we going to die

HARRY
Yup

HELEN
Id say its working

HARRY
Theyll either torture us to

death shoot us in the head or

leave us until the bomb goes off

HELEN
Okay okay I get it How long

HARRY

moment Then motions to one of his men
267 INT TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT

Samir lifts Harrys head and sees that he is pretty shitfaced

SAMIR
Is there anything you would like
to tell me before we start

HARRY
Yes Im going to kill you
pretty soon

SAMIR
(calmly preparing his
instruments)
I see How exactly

SAMIR
Well I thought Id break your
neck then use you as a human
shield then kill the guard with
that knife there on your table
and take his gun

Samir approaches Harry with a long steel needle probe

SAMIR
(humoring Harry)
And what makes you think you can
do all that

HARRY
Because I picked the lock on
these handcuffs

He holds them up to show Samir Then he explodes out of the
chair-- Breaks the torturers neck-- Spins him between himself
and the guard-- Who then hesitates to fire-- Giving Harry the
split second he needs to grab the knife from the table and
throw it into the guards eye killing him instantly

Helen is flat blown away Wow It only took a few seconds for
Harry to reverse the situation Her Harry He picks up the
guards 9mm pistol and staggers over to her

HARRY
Dont move

He kneels down in front of her Gently he slips his hands
between her thighs getting a grip on the grenade then sliding
his fingers slowly over the spoon to hold it securely

He stops moving suddenly She realizes with a sudden jolt of
terror that he has frozen
HELEN
What is it

HARRY
(staring transfixed)
God you have great legs

HELEN
Harry snap out of it

She sees how shitfaced he is He holds the grenade up gripped
safely so the spoon cant fly off

HARRY
Go it baby

248 EXT BUILDING - NIGHT

Harry and Helen emerge from the building creeping through the
shadows She stops him for a second Gets very close to him
whispering crouched in the shadows

HELEN

Tell me something before this
stuff wears off and you start
lying again

HARRY
What

HELEN
Do you still love me

HARRY
Yes

HELEN
As much as you used to

HARRY
No

(she deflates)
Much more

She looks into his eyes and knows he is telling the truth

HELEN
(grinning)
It wore off

At that moment they hear yelling from the cinder-block
building

HARRY
They found the bodies Come on--

249 EXT SWAMP - NIGHT

Harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of
the mangrove swamp A LIGHT HITS THEM TWO TERRORISTS
running around the corner open fire with AK47s just as Harry
and Helen reach a cluster of palm trees The trunks explode
with bullet hits as they run through the darkness

As the two terrorists move through the trees Harry lunges from
the shadows and grabs one from behind He wrests his rifle
away and swings it at the other knocking his AK down The
first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him but Harry
grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner

Then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two-
hand neck-breaker-- SNAP

Two more run around the corner of a building Harry stomps his
foot down on one of the AKs which is lying across a log It
flips into the air and he catches it in firing position

and takes them out with two well-aimed bursts Helen comes
out of the shadows staring at Harry in amazement His shirt is
ripped he is scratched and bleeding holding an assault rifle
expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal

HELEN
I married Rambo

He grabs her and kisses her passionately

crates Then swings into action-- He hurls the grenade as hard

as he can down to the other end of the building KABOOM He
uses the distraction to move forward But it goes wrong almost
right away A TERRORIST comes around a corner behind him

on a pipe and goes sprawling-- Losing the AK47 which slides
under some equipment and-- Seven terrorists run toward him
with guns raised

The burst kills two more terrorists and-- The Mac-10
cartwheels and hits further down ANOTHER BURST Another
terrorist is splattered

It spins and hits another step-- ANOTHER RANDOM BURST

trucks to get going The other terrorists return fire at Harry--

FUEL blasts out of the nozzle and-- Harry fires his AK right
across the nozzle-- The muzzle-blast ignites the av-gas and he
has a flame thrower with a 70 foot reach

Harry lit demonically by the inferno paints the whole area
setting vehicles afire and scattering the terrorists

wedding ring turned inward the diamond on the palm-side Her
face darkens with fury and she points the gun at Helens face
