The voice of an unseen old man calls out to us

CONON (V0O)

The Punic War was a time of greed
and tragedy After Carthage
united the Greek cities against
Rome the punishment for their
audacity was swift Terrible

A HUGE BOULDER SUDDENLY SMASHES THROUGH SAND AND BRICK
TOWARD US We’re inside a building that is being
decimated by CATAPULTED BOULDERS

As men in ANCIENT GARB scramble through the opening to
streets that are swarmed with soldiers we realize we are
in the middle of an urban war in

EXT CARTHAGE - CITY OF AGRIGENTUM - 261 BC

Carthaginian PEASANTS try to defend themselves against
the Roman SOLDIERS only to be massacred by the hundreds

CONON (V0O)

City after city was sacked The
fires could be seen throughout the
isle But Romes greatest triumph
was in the neighboring seas

EXT MEDITERRANEAN SEA - THE AEGATES ISLANDS - 241 BC

SOLDIERS on ROMAN SHIPS swing BRIDGES attached to their
masts onto CARTHAGINIAN SHIPS They race over bridges and
slaughter Carthaginians burning and sinking the vessels

CONON (VO)
Hamilcar Barca King of Carthage
surrendered and was forced to pay
tithes for ten years This bitter
price has made Hamilcars son
Hannibal hungry for revenge

EXT CARTHAGE CITY CASTLE - BALCONY - 225 BC - DAY

A man whose face we do not see HANNIBAL puts on a
helmet with CURLED HORNS He raises his sword and
hundreds of Carthaginians in the streets below cheer

We race PAST THE CROWD and then OVER BARREN LAND until we
reach the sea ZOOMING AROUND THE COAST we arrive ina
DESERT On the desert is a road The Road to Alexandria

A merchant drives his WAGON up that road
CONON (VO)
Here in Alexandria we are men
from many worlds and just as many
allegiances But the rising drums
of war do not resound within these
walls

EXT STREETS OF ALEXANDRIA EGYPT - 225 BC - SAME
The heavy WAGON reaches the gates of Alexandria

With a whip’s crack SOLDIERS urge bulls to shove open
tall gates The majesty of ALEXANDRIA is revealed

Entering with the wagon we drift through the
international interracial bustling metropolis of
ancient Alexandria past gilded Egyptian soldiers on
horseback arriving at the LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA

CONON (VO)
Here at the Library of
Alexandria as long as peace is
the Pharoahs law the greatest
minds in the world find sanctuary
Here we are free to unravel the
mysteries of the universe

The disembodied tour ends at the glorious courtyard of
the Library of Alexandria Hundreds of students and
Alexandrians alike are crowding the space to gaze at a
RAISED PLATFORM in the back of the courtyard

On the platform are a dozen STUDENTS of the Library
sitting on stools ERATOSTHENES (40s) a serious
teacher with a grim expression stands nearby

CONON a dignified man in his 50s stands at the front
addressing the crowd

CONON (CONTD)
And today we present to you the
work of our most gifted students
We pray that you are inspired
entertained and reminded that the
ingenuity fostered by peace is
beyond value and exceedingly rare

Conon looks back eyes an empty stool among the Students
Someone is absent He sighs

CONON (CONT’D)
A fact that perhaps some of my
students need to take a little
more seriously
INT ALEXANDRIAN BAR —- DAY

A quill sloppily writes in ink upon a WAITRESS’ AMPLE
BOSOM The writing is MATH

ARCHIMEDES a slender man in his 20s with an easy grin
shows off in a packed bar for a crowd of students and
drunks The BUXOM WAITRESS giggles as he writes

ARCHIMEDES
(drunkenly joking)
Control yourself you are ruining
the discovery of the century

BUXOM WAITRESS
But it tickles

ARCHIMEDES
(finishing)
There If you divide any circle’s
circumference by its diameter -
any - you get the same number

STUDENT
Amazing

The crowd claps and the Buxom Waitress tips wine into
Archimedes’ mouth Seals it with a kiss

EXT OUTSIDE THE BAR

A young beautiful and stately woman AMELIA is pointed
toward the bar by a STREET MERCHANT She hears BOISTEROUS
LAUGHTER spilling out Steeling herself she approaches

INT THE BAR SAME
Archimedes pours wine for himself and his friends

ARCHIMEDES
It’s just barely more than three
I’m working on it--

AMELIA (0S)
My business is not with you it is
with Heracleides

Archimedes notices Amelia trying to muscle her way
through the bar A couple ROWDY STUDENTS drunk since
noon accost her

CARTHAGE STUDENT
If it’s Greek you’re after I can
be of assistance

The Carthaginian student is shoved by a Roman Student
ROMAN STUDENT
Why would she want the refuse of
Carthage when she could have a
Roman stallion like me

AMELIA

Heracleides is all I seek He’s a
mathematician At the Library of
Alexandria

ROMAN STUDENT
The pretty lady wants some math

CARTHAGE STUDENT
All ovals are circles but not all
circles are ovals

He makes a grab for her chest She slaps him away
Archimedes slides in between her and the Students

ARCHIMEDES
(to the students)
If Hercules and Hannibal were to
get into a fight who would win

ROMAN STUDENT
Hercules

CARTHAGE STUDENT
Hannibal

The two lunge at each other and start to wrestle

BAR PATRON
(yells)
A Roman and a Carthaginian are
fighting

Students and Locals take sides CARTHAGINIANS help their
comrade ROMANS join the Roman Student A riot starts

ARCHIMEDES
You’re welcome

AMELIA
(horrified)
They’11 kill each other

ARCHIMEDES
You seek Heracleides

AMELIA
(ducks a brawler)
His Uncle has sent me to check up
on him Now that I’m here I see
why If his education is being
wasted I will halt his funding
ARCHIMEDES
Poor fellow I wouldn’t want to be
in his sandals

A CARTHAGINIAN tosses a ROMAN out the window Several
UNIFORMED SOLDIERS enter arresting the rioters

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
(to Amelia)
See No reason to worry Fighting
is illegal here Too many touchy
people these days you understand

AMELIA
And what is your name

ARCHIMEDES
Archimedes The Archimedes

A group of LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN at the bar overhear

LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN 1
Archimedes the scholar

Archimedes looks at Amelia and shrugs he gets this a
lot Amelia frowns unimpressed

LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN 2
It is an honor to meet you I am--

ARCHIMEDES
My biggest admirer Yes I’m sure

LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN 2
I intended to give you my name

ARCHIMEDES
Oh I’d only forget it This young
woman is new to the city and
trying to find someone Maybe you
can help

AMELIA
I am here to find King Hieron II’s
nephew Heracleides

LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN 1
Heracleides
(the two giggle)
Heracleides changed his name He
has become more famous since

AMELIA
(starting to realize)
Changed his name To what

BOTH LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN
Archimedes
Amelia turns around Archimedes is long gone Amelia
realizes she’s been tricked The Women LAUGH at her

AMELIA
I suspect I’m going to dislike
this assignment

EXT STREETS OF ALEXANDRIA - SAME

Archimedes moves quickly through the Alexandrian streets
He sidesteps a camel weaves through the thick crowds
and nicks a flagon of wine from a merchant’s wagon

Archimedes reaches the entrance to the Library Courtyard
and sees an impassable herd of people pushing to get
inside He looks up to the walls of the Library

Sees a PROPPED-UP WAGON nearby heavy with merchandise

Archimedes kicks off the propping leg of the wagon and it
tips forward creating a ramp to the top of the wall

EXT WALLS INSIDE THE LIBRARY - LATER

Archimedes hops over the top

EXT LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA - COURTYARD

Archimedes approaches the platform from behind He hears
crowds applauding Conon sits on a stool on the side

An eager student DEIMOS (30s) stands at the front
exhibiting a large wooden device

DEIMOS
My invention masters time itself

He inserts a mirror The SUN’S RAYS are captured by the
mirror and REFLECTED against a nearby wall in SEGMENTED
SLICES The crowd ooohs

Archimedes sneakily joins the Students on the platform
Eratosthenes notices And is not pleased

DEIMOS (CONTD)
A device that gives Man accurate
readings of the sun’s hours
(self-consciously)
That is if you reposition it
every day And if there are no
clouds in the sky And if--

ERATOSTHENES
(interrupting)
Well done Thank you Deimos
The crowd politely claps Archimedes rolls his eyes
Deimos helps his lackeys move the sundial away

ERATOSTHENES (CONTD)
Citizens of Alexandria I pray you
have enjoyed the festival of
Athena It appears we have arrived
at our final student
(beat)
I present Archimedes of Syra--

The students in the crowd ERUPT IN APPLAUSE AND CHEERS
Eratosthenes rankles at the praise CONON hides a smile

Archimedes grins wide and waves to the crowd soaking it
all in as he walks forward

ERATOSTHENES (CONTD)
I am eager for your presentation
as much as the crowd Archimedes
since I have yet to see you toil
on anything

ARCHIMEDES

(addresses the crowd)
That you could not see the
evidence of my work is not
surprising Eratosthenes

(the crowd snickers)
For I am using my near-limitless
genius to advance the field of
arithmatic

The Students and Locals cheer and whistle their support

ERATOSTHENES
As head of mathematics here at the
Library I fail to see how you can
improve upon it

The crowd reacts to this insult highly entertained

ARCHIMEDES
Allow me to illuminate

He signals to A STUDENT at a SIDE GATE The Student
grins opens the gate and directs A HERD OF COWS inside
They are black white brown spottedAnd unruly

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
If you are the expert
Eratosthenes answer me this
Among the cows the number of
white is one third plus one
quarter of the total black cattle
the number of black is one quarter
plus one fifth the total of the
spotted cattle
the number of spotted is one fifth
plus one sixth the total of the
brown cattle the number of the
brown is one sixth plus one
seventh the total of the white
cattle What is the composition of
the herd

As Archimedes rattles off the figures that would go down
in history as The Cattle Problem (only solved centuries
later by the first computer) cows create chaos

ERATOSTHENES
(purpling with rage)
Get those cows out of my library

ARCHIMEDES
How many cows would you like gone

ERATOSTHENES
-all of them

ARCHIMEDES
You cannot solve my equation
(to the crowd)
Maybe you should just count them

The Students and Alexandrians hoot and holler A LARGE
COW lumbers up on stage and moos at Eratosthenes

ERATOSTHENES
Get it away from me

CONON
You’ve made your point
Archimedes Now be done with it

ARCHIMEDES
(to the crowd)
Push the cows to the doors then

Everyone laughs and assists pushing the cows out of the
courtyard Eratosthenes gets PINNED LICKED by his cow

ERATOSTHENES
(sputtering)
Archimedes We will speak of this

Suddenly Archimedes is lifted up by his fellow students
ARCHIMEDES
I’m afraid I am currently

indisposed

The students drag him away cheering He sees Conon shake
his head at him disappointed Archimedes shrugs
EXT LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA - COURTYARD - MORNING
A PASSIONATE YOUNG MAN stands at the feet of a statue

PASSIONATE YOUNG MAN
(to the crowd)
He will avenge his father and
throw the Roman dogs out of
Carthage once and for all

Archimedes sits at a bench not listening Pours sand out
of his hand Makes a note on a scroll of PARCHMENT

PASSIONATE YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
Our day is coming Join with us
Join with Carthage Join Hann--

The Passionate Young Man is yanked from his perch by
SOLDIERS of the Alexandrian Guard

SOLDIER
You will join your friends in
jail Take him

PASSIONATE YOUNG MAN
(as he’s pulled away)
We will not stay silent Tell
Rome tell the world Hannibal
rises and he will triumph

Conon approaches Archimedes unseen

CONON
This looks to be Archimedes in
front of me but rarely have I
seen him looking so studious

ARCHIMEDES
That is very much like the voice
of Conon but that cannot be Even
he doesn’t sound that old

CONON
(smiles and sits)
You should respect the wisdom of
your elders

ARCHIMEDES
My father was “wisely” told by his
elders that he could not be an
astronomer He died a soldier And
far too young

CONON
Count the stars then Realize his
dream Your Uncle patiently
supports your education

ARCHIMEDES
My uncle has money to spare And
time And armies even

Conon takes Archimedes’ parchment from him On it are
basic schematics for a small CATAPULT and a CHAMBER POT
The trajectory of the chamber pot leads to a STICK
FIGURE The name “Eratosthenes” is written by the figure

CONON
I see you have solved the
triangulation issues to shorten
distance Your wasted talents as
ever are quite impressive

ARCHIMEDES
Thank you

CONON
But you tarnish your reputation
with ridiculous pranks

ARCHIMEDES
True I would have liked to have
shown the crowd that I am capable
of solving that word problem

CONON
Now that would have been impress-

ARCHIMEDES
But how could I have fit
50389082 cows in the courtyard

Conon is floored that Archimedes has the actual answer

CONON

Archimedes you are my most gifted
student and an invaluable addition
to the Library

(Archimedes beams)
But if I hear of any more
embarrassments like the surprise
you pulled at the festival your
Uncle shall know my displeasure

ARCHIMEDES
I do not wish to grieve you
Conon I respect you and I love
you So I will do my best to keep
you unaware of any future
wrongdoings

He jumps up and strides away confidently
CONON

What do you mean unaware
Archimedes

Archimedes is gone Conon sighs Shakes his head

EXT STREETS OF ALEXANDRIA - DAY

Amelia pushes through a boisterous market in Alexandria
She approaches a BURLY MARKET SELLER

AMELIA
Excuse me do you know where--

Suddenly she hears the LOUD ROAR OF A LARGE CROWD

EXT THE WALLS OF THE LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA - LATER
Amelia finds the CROWD thronged around an exterior wall
A young man with a GREEK MASK stands on a cart Draws a
complicated geometrical shape on the wall in paint

He finishes with a flourish and the crowd cheers

The Masked Man puts his hand to his ear Beckoning

CROWDSPERSON 1
A perfect circle

CROWDSPERSON 2
A circle within an oval

The Masked Man mimes disgust at these Too easy

ERATOSTHENES
A heptagon

The crowd turns to ERATOSTHENES He stands with crossed
arms and a sneer on his face

ERATOSTHENES (CONTD)
With only a compass and straight
edge

The crowd “ooohs” this That isn’t so easy

CROWDSPERSON 2
The Euclidian Challenge

CROWDSPERSON 3
It’s impossible

With a sweep of his arms the Masked Man quiets the
crowd He beckons to nearby students They provide him
with a STRAIGHT EDGE and a COMPASS - common equipment

The Masked Man draws while the crowd waits with baited
breath Amelia gasps as the Man finishes with a flourish

The crowd goes wild Suddenly an angry voice calls out

SOLDIER
You disgrace our Pharaohs city

The Masked Man turns to the small posse of ALEXANDRIAN
GUARD SOLDIERS as they move into the street

MASKED MAN
You dare call my work a disgrace
Do not pretend you understand it
No one here will believe you
The crowd laughs at the soldiers Amelia winces

SOLDIER
You will come with us

MASKED MAN
Don’t make me do everything for
you Catch me first

He STEALS A KISS from a PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN Then pulls
himself up to the roof and races along it to the west

SOLDIER
After him

The soldiers turn but are stopped by a LARGE SOLDIER
MARCUS MARCELLUS (30s) not a Roman to be fucked with

MARCELLUS
Wait You four chase him You
two follow me

He aims EAST The bewildered Soldiers do as he commands

EXT ALEXANDRIA ROOFTOPS - MOMENTS LATER
The Masked Man hops on a canopy and crawls into a window

Soldiers below do not see this and continue running

INT ALEXANDRIAN HOUSEHOLD - SAME

The Man removes his mask He is of course Archimedes
He peers out the window Watches the soldiers run away

He turns around sighing in relief and is nearly brained
by an ANGRY HOUSEWIFE brandishing a chamber pot

ANGRY HOUSEWIFE
Guards

ARCHIMEDES
Sssh No it’s okay I’m not-

ANGRY HOUSEWIFE
(swings again)
GUARDS

Archimedes darts back out the window as fast as he can

EXT LIBRARY WALLS - LATER

Archimedes pulls himself over the walls of the Library
landing back in the courtyard Wipes sweat from his brow

MARCELLUS (0S)
Here let us help you with that

ARCHIMEDES
Huh

Archimedes is splashed with water As he attempts to
clear his eyes soldiers swarm him and tie his arms
MARCELLUS reveals himself holding an empty pitcher

MARCELLUS
You are a student of the Library

ARCHIMEDES
A resident genius

MARCELLUS
Not from what I’ve seen Take him

ARCHIMEDES
Wait I can explain I can pay

CUT TO

EXT OPEN AIR PRISON - THAT NIGHT

The scum of Alexandria awaits sentencing in a prison
yard Archimedes tries to get a SOLDIER’s attention

ARCHIMEDES
I am far too important to be
allowed to starve
(Soldier ignores him)
I am not like theseanimals

A large brutish thug EPYCIDES(20s) turns to Archimedes

EPYCIDES
Animal Did you call me animal

ARCHIMEDES
(to Epycides )
Everyone but you
(to the soldier)

My Uncle is King Hieron II and he
will reward you handsomely for my
release

A second prisoner HIPPOCRATES (20s) thinner but meaner
looking overhears this and looks at Epycides

HIPPOCRATES
King Hieron Of Syracuse

ARCHIMEDES
(to the soldier)
Gold wine women Please

Hippocrates suddenly slaps Archimedes on the back

HIPPOCRATES
Come now friend Don’t waste your
words on him We’re the ones you
want to talk to

ARCHIMEDES
You meanor else

The two brothers laugh at Archimedes’ terror

HIPPOCRATES
The name is Hippocrates This is
my brother Epycides

EPYCIDES nods a hulkish hello

EPYCIDES
A pleasure

HIPPOCRATES
Youre a Syracusan We’re from
Carthage We Greeks used to stick
together

ARCHIMEDES
Not anymore

HIPPOCRATES
You shouldn’t let a little thing
like Rome get in the way of an old
friendship

ARCHIMEDES
And here I thought to speak
against Rome is treason

EPYCIDES
That’s not all we’1ll do against
Rome

HIPPOCRATES
What my brother means to say is
that we’re good loyal men of
Carthage Straight from Hannibals
army

ARCHIMEDES
Hannibal has an army now does he

HIPPOCRATES
And if you were Hannibal
humiliated by your father’s
surrender to Rome what would you
do with an army

ARCHIMEDES
What every army does that loses to
Rome Pay taxes

A tense beat Hippocrates laughs Epycides follows suit

HIPPOCRATES
Hannibal could use a smart fellow
like you on our side Someone who
could talk sense into your Uncle
about the dangers of a Roman
alliance

ARCHIMEDES
I am not a politician I ama
mathematician

HIPPOCRATES
War makes hyphenates of every man

ARCHIMEDES
I hear Hannibal makes whores of
every woman And slaves of every
child

Hippocrates’ smile runs away

HIPPOCRATES
We do not need to be friends But
it would be in your best interest
And in the best interest of
Syracuse your home

ARCHIMEDES
You would do best to go to
Syracuse and threaten her in
person

Epycides picks Archimedes up roughly

EPYCIDES
We are asking nicely

ARCHIMEDES
(choking)
You are asking The wrong Man

Behind Epycides Hippocrates pulls out a hidden DAGGER

HIPPOCRATES
Hannibal’s army will come for
Syracuse If you won’t deliver
this message to the King with your
tongue your blood will do the job
just as well

Epycides throws Archimedes against the wall stunning
him Archimedes barely fumbles out of the way of
Hippocrates’ dagger He is not much of a fighter

SOLDIER
What is going on over there

Criminals jump up hollering for Hippocrates to win

Archimedes can only stay a step ahead for so long He
sees Hippocrates LUNGE with his dagger-expects the worst

But suddenly Hippocrates is felled by a large SOLDIER It
is MARCELLUS He offers his hand to Archimedes

MARCELLUS
Are you hurt

Behind Marcellus Epycides raises a large rock

ARCHIMEDES
Behind you

Marcellus unsheathes A BEAUTIFUL KNIFE in a lightning-
fast movement and holds it to Epycides’ neck

MARCELLUS
Hannibal’s dogs are not welcome in
Alexandria Tell him the Roman
Marcus Marcellus says this

EPICYDES
(drops the rock)
When I get my sword that pretty
knife of yours won’t save you

AMELIA (0S)
Excuse me

The men all turn to see Amelia at the prison gate

AMELIA (CONTD)
I come with funds to release the
problematic Syracusan

EXT STREETS OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON - MOMENTS LATER

Marcellus escorts Archimedes out of the prison Amelia
pays the PRISON BOOKKEEPER She turns to Archimedes

AMELIA
What were you thinking You could
have been convicted of a serious
crime

ARCHIMEDES
Can I just say in my defense
that I don’t care

AMELIA
You will care when King Hieron
cuts off your funding

MARCELLUS
You are Syracusan royalty But
you are not trained in combat

ARCHIMEDES
Thank the gods for soldiers
Please tell me how to reward you

MARCELLUS
(thinks)
Do not pay me for this one
kindness Hire me

ARCHIMEDES
To do what

MARCELLUS
Sword training Basic defense You
can pay me then

AMELIA
Excuse me Hello I represent the
interests of Syracuse We have
invested in this man’s education

ARCHIMEDES
(triumphant)
I am too important to be beaten
senseless on a regular schedule

AMELIA
--and I believe it will be best
for Syracuse if he does undergo
training in the ways of the sword

ARCHIMEDES
What

Marcellus smirks at Archimedes
Marcellus

AMELIA
I will pay And I will supervise

MARCELLUS
(frowns )
Women are a distraction

AMELIA
We and I do include the King when
I say “we” insist

MARCELLUS
(annoyed)
Do not forget your coin purse
(to Archimedes)
Until tomorrow

strides off

AMELIA
You have changed your name to
“Archimedes” meaning “Master of
Thought”

ARCHIMEDES
Is it not accurate

AMELIA
(amused )
That remains to be seen Tomorrow

Amelia starts to walk away

ARCHIMEDES
(catching up to her)
I remember a beautiful Amelia in
Syracuse A senator’s daughter

AMELIA
Senator Sacchus

ARCHIMEDES
Perhaps we should include a
private inspection of my physical
prowess tonight So you can assure
Hieron I am in the peak of health

AMELIA
I am eager to see a demonstration
of your form and strength
(pushes him away)
During the lesson

Amelia leaves The first ever to turn him down

INT LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA - STABLES - NEXT DAY

Archimedes shovels hay into a DONKEY’s stall He has
created a makeshift fulcrum and lever to take up much of
the weight of the hay as he moves it Casually ingenius

Conon enters

CONON
I see Eratosthenes is still angry
A curious punishment stable work

Archimedes turns Conon reacts to the bruises

CONON (CONT’D)
Your face--

ARCHIMEDES
It is nothing A misunderstanding
with a couple of Carthaginians

CONON
I see If Hannibal has ambitions
for Rome he will need Syracuse on
his side His war will threaten
your home Your people

ARCHIMEDES
Soldiers stabbing each other over
parcels of land has nothing to do
with me

Conon takes the pitchfork from Archimedes’ hands

CONON
The great works of Man are often
subjugated by the great wars of
Man

ARCHIMEDES
No need for lectures my friend
We are not in your class

Archimedes feeds an apple to the donkey Indignant

CONON

Here you are with all the tools
to change the world and you wish
to do nothing Your choices are a
luxury

(exiting)
But it is time to decide what kind
of man you will become Or the
Fates will lose their patience and
decide for you

Archimedes alone pats the donkey Disquieted

EXT SOLDIER TRAINING COURTYARD - SUNSET

YOUNG MEN train to fight in a dusty courtyard Marcellus
and Amelia stand nearby Having been left waiting

MARCELLUS
Punctuality Not a Syracusan
trait I see

AMELIA
As much as tact is a soldier’s

MARCELLUS
Do not drum up an ill humor with
me woman Where is he

AMELIA
(sighs)
I’1l start with the brothels You
check the bars

They glare at each other and part ways

INT RESTAURANT IN ALEXANDRIA - NIGHT

Belly-dancers weave through crowded tables Archimedes
downs what must be his eighth drink

MARCELLUS enters and spies Archimedes

MARCELLUS
You missed your first lesson

ARCHIMEDES
I outsmarted you

MARCELLUS
Yes You hid at a restaurant next
to the Library Very clever

ARCHIMEDES
What are you doing in Alexandria
anyway Aren’t you needed in Rome

MARCELLUS
Not quite yet Until I am there
is money to be made here

ARCHIMEDES
I will pay you double if you stay
away from me

Marcellus sighs He pulls out a stretched skin and clay
figurines On the skin is drawn a cross-section of boxes
A game that is the ancestor to chess

MARCELLUS
Let us play for it

ARCHIMEDES
A game

MARCELLUS

You should outwit me easily Move
two pieces together
(demonstrates )
Three pieces together can take
away one of my pieces If you
remove all my pieces before I
remove yours I will leave If
not you will start your lesson at
dawn tomorrow

Archimedes assents They play the game

ARCHIMEDES
I wish to move four pieces not
two Then you would be cornered

MARCELLUS
Games are based on combat Combat
has rules You cannot change your
materials or the laws of physics
simply because you want to win

ARCHIMEDES
I have got another of your pieces

In one move Marcellus captures Archimedes’ FINAL PIECE
MARCELLUS
You may not have a care for your
future but I do Tomorrow At
dawn Do not disappoint me
Marcellus leaves Archimedes slumps in his chair
Two YOUNG WOMEN next to Archimedes struggle with a BOTTLE
OF WINE Archimedes takes it from them wraps the bottom

in a cloth bangs the base against the wall twice

The CORK displaced now sticks out the top He grabs it
with his teeth and pulls it out Presents the bottle

YOUNG WOMAN
You’re amazing

ARCHIMEDES
I know

The girls laugh Cheered up he laughs with them

EXT SMALL AMPHITHEATER IN ALEXANDRIA - DAWN

Archimedes is SMACKED IN THE FACE by the flat of
Marcellus’ blade He falls backward onto stone

The nearly empty round stage is faced by rows of
chiseled seats Empty except for Amelia

AMELIA
(snorts )
Be careful with your toy
Marcellus Break him and you will
owe King Hieron a hefty sum

ARCHIMEDES
I am fine

Marcellus comes at Archimedes again sending him
scampering away

MARCELLUS
Come now you must stay on the
battlefield

ARCHIMEDES

Getting close to you is a death
sentence I am better off throwing
sticks from a distance

AMELIA
You would need a large stick
ARCHIMEDES
I assure you my stick is very
large
MARCELLUS

If you want to win never give a
single foot of land to your enemy

Archimedes rushes Marcellus He fares better but
ultimately his sword is knocked away Archimedes stumbles
over a SLEEPING HOMELESS MAN on the side of the stage

AMELIA
(laughs )
Archimedes be careful or you will
hurt someone other than yourself

ARCHIMEDES
Of course this is funny to you
You will never have to raise an
unwieldy length of metal to defend
an arbitrary country line

AMELIA
Oh no

Amelia picks up the sword

MARCELLUS
Put that down before you cut
yourself

She attacks Marcellus defends retreating backward
several feet He is finally able to counter She smiles

AMELIA
My father wanted sons He raised
my sisters and I to take up the
sword instead

Amelia returns the sword to the amazed Marcellus

MARCELLUS
That wasimpressive
AMELIA
Women can be more than just “a

distraction”

A charged moment between he and Amelia Archimedes
doesn’t like it

CICERO (0S)
Pardon me

The trio turn to see a distinguished-looking Roman
CICERO (40s) hesitantly enter the amphitheater

CICERO (CONTD)
Good day citizens I am Cicero
the legendary biographer

ARCHIMEDES
You are famous for writing about
others who are genuinely famous

CICERO
(ignores him)
I was told Archimedes Inventor of
the Cattle Problem The Great
Geometer himself is nearby

ARCHIMEDES
You have found him

Cicero looks at Marcellus misunderstanding

CICERO
My gods an Adonis as well

ARCHIMEDES
Not him Me I am Archimedes
CICERO
You You smell like a drunk

ARCHIMEDES
That is also true

CICERO
I seek the wise and mighty
Archimedes And I will not be
played with by some smelly child

Archimedes narrows his eyes He points at the OLD
HOMELESS MAN who is awake muttering to himself

ARCHIMEDES
You are too shrewd for me Cicero
The real Archimedes is there

CICERO
Thatthat man But he is filthy

ARCHIMEDES
Archimedes is so obsessed with
numbers he sometimes forgets to
bathe But he is a genius Look at
that imposing gray beard

Cicero looks in awe at the Homeless Man He rushes
him Hastily pulls out papyrus and ink

CICERO
Archimedes sir speak to me of
your mathematical processes

HOMELESS MAN
(finds an apple core)
Eureka

Fascinated Cicero writes the mumbling down

MARCELLUS
Is this a joke to you Cicero’s
biographies are widely read Every
man in Rome will think Archimedes
is a babbling old fool

AMELIA
King Hieron will not be pleased

ARCHIMEDES
Well if Hieron has women like you
fighting for Syracuse surely he
has no need of me

AMELIA
I have seen nothing of you that I
nor Syracuse have need of at all

to

ARCHIMEDES
Oh no I have far more
interesting things to show you
than a few pieces of flattened
steel being waved around Come

He spins on his heel and exits the amphitheater
Intrigued Amelia and Marcellus exchange looks follow

INT LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA - OBSERVATORY - LATER

The three enter a large room Windows are covered light
comes from oil lamps around the edges of the room

Taking up most of the room is an enormous MODEL OF THE
KNOWN SOLAR SYSTEM With the sun at its center

Using one finger Archimedes lifts the cranium-sized ball
that represents EARTH Everything is connected with ropes
and pulleys so it lifts easily

ARCHIMEDES
Give me but a place to stand in
the universe and I shall move the
Earth

He grins at the other two They are astounded

AMELIA
The sun is in the center

ARCHIMEDES
Aristarchos’ idea And a good one

Amelia walks around the room marveling at the
construction Marcellus approaches Earth frowning

MARCELLUS
Seeing the world from a god’s view
makes even clearer the importance
of war Someday there will be
peace Borders will become
permanent and the size of your
country will never increase

ARCHIMEDES
I see Better to kill everyone
while you still can

MARCELLUS
I am no murderer I fight for
Rome For order and reason
Hannibal razes conquered towns to
the ground Killing everyone

ARCHIMEDES
Roman soldiers have the right to
pillage any town they defeat do
they not I fail to see a
difference

MARCELLUS
(angering)
We do not wipe them out We
embrace them They become part of

Rome
ARCHIMEDES
How lucky for them
AMELIA
(placating)

--Perhaps it is time for lunch--

MARCELLUS
You speak against Rome

ARCHIMEDES
I speak for myself

A tense beat Suddenly SCREAMS are heard outside

EXT STREETS OF ALEXANDRIA

Archimedes Marcellus and Amelia exit the observatory
into the STREET to find absolute chaos EGYPTIANS GREEKS
and ROMANS run in all directions The clashing of swords
can be heard ALEXANDRIAN GUARDS try to control a riot

AMELIA
By the gods

HIPPOCRATES the sneaky thug from the prison rides a
horse into the fray

HIPPOCRATES
Fight on free citizens of
Carthage Bring any Roman you find
to his knees

He skewers an ALEXANDRIAN GUARD from his perch
Elsewhere the larger EPYCIDES smashes a guard’s head
against a city wall He turns to the rioting crowd

EPYCIDES
For the glory of Hannibal

Dozens of CARTHAGINIAN CRIMINALS from the prison armed
with knives and crude axes cry out in response

CARTHAGININANS
For Hannibal

An ALEXANDRIAN SOLDIER spots Marcellus RUNS to him

ALEXANDRIAN SOLDIER
The Carthaginians - they’ve
started a riot Marcellus they’re
killing anyone allied with Rome

Marcellus pushes Archimedes and Amelia back to the
observatory doors

MARCELLUS
Do not let them see you

He draws his sword and charges into the fray Archimedes
darts through the doors Amelia hesitates - sees
HIPPOCRATES engage with MARCELLUS from his horse--

INT LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA - OBSERVATORY - SAME

Archimedes runs through the solar system to the doors on
the other side Opening them he sees into the Main
Courtyard of the Library CARTHAGINIANS dart through the
scholars cutting down student and professor alike

Archimedes turns to warn Amelia but she is not with him

ARCHIMEDES
Amelia

EXT STREETS OF ALEXANDRIA - SAME

Amelia rushes a TOOTHLESS CARTHAGINIAN (20s) He grins at

her thinking her easy prey She knocks him down and

takes his sword from his unconscious hand

EXT LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA - MAIN COURTYARD - SAME

Archimedes is about to go back to find her--

CONON
This is a place of peace

Archimedes turns sees CONON beating a CARTHAGINIAN with
his scrolls

CONON (CONTD)
Of higher learning

Angered the Carthaginian brings down his sword

ARCHIMEDES
CONON

CONON IS CUT DOWN Archimedes rushes forward

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
No

The Carthaginian turns on Archimedes sword slicing
Archimedes barely rolls out of the way

INT LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA - OBSERVATORY - SAME

Archimedes tears into the room Bars the door behind him
SLAMS are heard as the Carthaginian forces his way in

Quickly Archimedes unties ROPE that is wrapped around a
HINGE The CARTHAGINIAN busts into the room Lifting his
sword he runs for Archimedes

CARTHAGINIAN
You are marked for Hades

Archimedes lets go of the ROPE It unspools and the
ENORMOUS SUN in the solar system swings down fast and
hard SLAMMING the Carthaginian against the WALL

ARCHIMEDES
I will see no gods today

An idea forms in Archimedes’ brain He yanks ROPE off of

another wall and the Sun LOWERS to the ground He grabs a
few hinges and kicks open one of the shuttered windows--

EXT STREETS OF ALEXANDRIA - SAME
Hippocrates and Marcellus battle They knock each other’s
swords out of their hands but Hippocrates gets close

stealing MARCELLUS’ BEAUTIFUL KNIFE from his hip

As Hippocrates LUNGES at Marcellus with the long knife
Amelia BLOCKS the attack with her purloined sword

AMELIA
You will need this

She tosses Marcellus his sword He stands and they face
Hippocrates Ready Hippocrates backs up

HIPPOCRATES
A delay of the inevitable

He disappears into the crowd Three large CARTHAGINIANS
take his place and attack Marcellus and Amelia

UP CLOSE

Archimedes’s HAND loops a HINGE around a second-floor
balcony and ties ROPE to it

UP CLOSE

Another HINGE is looped around the bars of a gate ROPE
is pulled through quickly by fervent hands

BACK ON THE STREET

Marcellus’ arm is sliced by one of the many Carthaginian
swords He cries out in pain

AMELIA
Marcus

She is suddenly knocked out from behind Marcellus
cradles her unconscious body in his arms--

Unaware that behind him an ENORMOUS SUN LIFTS into the
air “conjured” into the sky above a MASKED MAN

MARCELLUS
(to Amelia)
I am sorry--

CARTHAGININAN 1
What man is that

CARTHAGININAN 2
That is no man

CARTHAGININAN 3
A sign from the gods

Marcellus looks up and sees Archimedes wearing the GREEK
MASK and standing on a rooftop APPARENTLY HOLDING THE
SUN above his head Apollo himself would be terrified
CLOSE ON THE SUN
Archimedes is not holding the sphere up with inhuman
strength rather it is being held aloft by the ROPE
looped around the rooftops
ARCHIMEDES
(in a booming voice)
No More Blood
ON THE GROUND
The Carthaginians waver superstitious and nervous
HIPPOCRATES
A Roman trick No god would dare

defy Hannibal

EPYCIDES
Bring him down

Enraged the Carthaginians rush toward Archimedes

CLOSE ON THE SUN

He unhooks the ROPE The SUN ACCELERATES DOWN THE ROOF
ON THE STREET
The first few Carthaginians are blown off their feet when
the SUN punches through the group The remaining thugs

scramble to escape but are mowed down

The Sun rumbles toward Marcellus He shields Amelia with
his body Slowing the Sun stops before reaching them

ON THE ROOFTOPS
Archimedes lifts his mask and smiles
CARTHAGINIAN (0S)
You will be wearing that smile

around your throat

He turns sees a Carthaginian unsheathe his sword and
dive in for a killing blow-

SHLUNK A SPEAR pierces the Carthaginian in the abdomen
thrusting him off the roof Archimedes looks down
MARCELLUS SALUTES Archimedes He returns the gesture

Into the streets of broken bodies ride the PHARAOH’S
SOLDIERS on horseback in GOLD livery

PHARAOH’S CAPTAIN
All rioting shall be seen as
treason in the eyes of the great
Pharaoh Who here desires to make
war on Egypt’s land

The Carthaginians limp and run away what few can
Hippocrates wipes and CONCEALS MARCELLUS’ KNIFE IN HIS
CLOTHES He and Epycides disappear into the crowd
EXT LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA - MAIN COURTYARD - LATER

Archimedes kneels over Conon’s body Marcellus approaches
him Amelia in his arms

ARCHIMEDES
(jumps up)

Is she--

MARCELLUS
Wounded She will recover

ARCHIMEDES
Thank you

MARCELLUS

Thank you

EXT LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA - MAIN COURTYARD - NEXT DAY

FLOWER PETALS rain down on the Library courtyard thrown
by SOBBING STUDENTS along the balcony as BODIES OF THE
DEAD are honored in a funeral ceremony

Archimedes helps carry Conon’s body through the courtyard
to the pyre His eyes hard void of his usual
playfulness A MOURNFUL CHOIR sings

AT THE PYRE

Conon’s body is laid down upon brambles and wood on the
courtyard dais Archimedes places a COIN in Conon’s
mouth A Roman ritual

ARCHIMEDES
For the Ferryman A far better use
for coin than I ever had As well
you know

MOURNERS
(chanting)
Igne natura renovatur integra

The pyre is lit by ERATOSTHENES He weeps as his
compatriots burn Archimedes and Marcellus watch

ARCHIMEDES
If not for you I would be with
them
MARCELLUS
(guilty)

There is something I must ask
forgiveness for I did not tutor
you to earn a few extra coins
Hannibal would need to control
Syracuse if he wishes to crush
Rome It is your home that will
determine the victor of his war I
pursued your trust to encourage
your loyalty to Rome and through
you the Syracusan king I did not
expect to finda friend

ARCHIMEDES
(thinks it over)
Conon would have said it is
destiny In the middle of such
terrible loss to find friendship

MARCELLUS
You will be a great man someday
Archimedes Despite yourself

ARCHIMEDES
(offers his arm)
Until we meet again

MARCELLUS
I pray it will be soon

The two embrace Marcellus walks out to the--

STREETS OF ALEXANDRIA
Running into AMELIA as she enters She carries a LETTER

AMELIA
Marcus I am much healed and I
would like to thank you --

MARCELLUS
I am called back to Rome Hannibal
makes to advance on our borders
When you return to Syracuse urge
their loyalty

AMELIA
It was my understanding that a
friendship between our countries
had already been established

MARCELLUS
Let us endeavor to keep that
friendship alive

AMELIA
One might misunderstand your tone
for a threat Marcellus

MARCELLUS
As long as Syracuse is loyal to
Rome there is nothing to fear
(he hesitates)
Goodbye

He bows awkwardly to her and strides away She watches

AT THE DAIS
Amelia approaches Archimedes He sees the LETTER

ARCHIMEDES
And what does my Uncle command

AMELIA
War is brewing Archimedes It is
time to come home

EXT SOUTH OF ALEXANDRIA - DAWN

Archimedes and Amelia ride away from the City of
Alexandria toward Syracuse Archimedes watches his
temporary home disappear One he will never see again

EXT GATES OF SYRACUSE - SOME DAYS LATER

Amelia Archimedes and their entourage approach the
mighty GATES OF SYRACUSE A great fortress the CASTLE of
Syracuse is atop a tall plateau

ARCHIMEDES
It has been too long since I’ve
had Syracusan wine

AMELIA
I am surprised you remember her at
all

ARCHIMEDES

Everything I am was begun here
Perhaps I have only been gone long
enough to bring knowledge home To
repay Syracuse for all she has
inspired in me

AMELIA
(impressed)
Nobler words than I expected

SOLDIERS open the OUTER GATES
ARCHIMEDES
That and being gone for so long
means I’1ll get a hero’s welcome
The INNER GATES swing wide open--
What must be ALL OF SYRACUSE is revealed At the sight of
Archimedes they let out an enormous CHEER Drums and

music begin in earnest Archimedes grins at Amelia

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
I see Syracuse remembers me

Amelia is speechless The crowd surges around Archimedes
and leads his horse to the front of a celebratory PARADE

AMELIA
Archimedes We must report to the
King

ARCHIMEDES

He will understand if I ama
little late

AMELIA
Archimedes

He is pulled away by the crowd Amelia smolders

EXT CITY STREETS OF SYRACUSE - LATER

The parade leads to the streets of Syracuse It is a
beautiful city by the sea that prizes arts and culture

INT SYRACUSE CASTLE - THRONE ROOM - SAME

At the top of the plateau is the CASTLE OF SYRACUSE
Looking down upon the celebration is KING HIERON II
(70s) a man who should be crippled by age but who
instead is robust and rarely sits on his throne

He is surrounded by the Syracusan SENATORS

KING HIERON II
(smiles)
He is home

The throne room door opens and Amelia is shown inside

AMELIA
King Hieron Senators Father

SENATOR SACCHUS embraces her A servant brings a glass of
wine King Hieron raises his glass to her

KING HIERON II
Well done little Amelia You have
brought back to us our crown
jewel And in one piece Do not
think I am unaware how difficult
that had to be

AMELIA
Yes well I fear you may be
disappointed by him He is
undisciplined disrespectful
insensitive to our plight and
generally nightmarish

ARCHIMEDES (0S)
The man sounds frightful

Amelia whirls to see Archimedes standing in the throne
room doorway a wreath of laurels in his hair

KING HIERON II
Nephew

ARCHIMEDES
Uncle

KING HIERON II

(embracing him)
Carthage will think twice when
they learn the greatest mind in
the known world is at last
returned to Syracuse

(raises his glass)
Toit is Archimedes now is it

SENATORS
Archimedes

ARCHIMEDES
To me

They drink Amelia shakes her head disgusted

KING HIERON II
I have a surprise for you
Something I am sure you will
appreciate

Archimedes is intrigued

INT SYRACUSE CASTLE - WAR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

With a flourish Hieron opens the double doors to his war
room Archimedes follows

KING HIERON II
Isn’t she beautiful

Archimedes’ smile melts away when he realizes Hieron is
indicating an enormous schematic of a ship

ARCHIMEDES
A boat How thrilling

KING HIERON II
(ignores his sarcasm)
Rome is too far to save us from
Carthaginian greed I have begun a
defensive plan of the most sneaky
and depraved kind Diplomacy

The Senators and Amelia have followed them in They look
to Archimedes expectantly

KING HIERON II (CONT’D)
You will make this A present for
the Pharaoh to secure an alliance
Even Hannibal would not dare
attack Syracuse if we are allied
with both Egypt and Rome

ARCHIMEDES
Rome is Hannibal’s target Not us
KING HIERON II
Without the port of Syracuse
Hannibal is cut off from Carthage
Cut off from supplies With
Syracuse under his command
Hannibal would be unstoppable

ARCHIMEDES
(beat)
Uncle this ship will not be
built

KING HIERON II
You refuse to build it

AMELIA
More likely he cannot

ARCHIMEDES
You are correct
(everyone reacts)
Mine will be twice as large And
twice as long

The Senators chatter surprised and doubtful

SENATOR SACCHUS
Young man I am familiar with your
work but a ship that big cannot
be built in the sea

ARCHIMEDES
Then it will be built on land

SENATOR SACCHUS
But it would be far too large to
get to water

ARCHIMEDES
Senator

SENATOR SACCHUS
Senator Sacchus

ARCHIMEDES
(eyes Amelia)
Ah I am familiar with your work
as well Very impressive

Sacchus and Amelia are offended

KING HIERON II
Archimedes I have always enjoyed
your puzzles But you are not a
boy And this is not a game--

ARCHIMEDES
Fear not Uncle It will be done
And it will be glorious The
Pharaoh will be grateful

KING HIERON II
Then we will have our alliance
And you will have earned your
tuition Amelia You seem to have
the magic touch with my nephew
Keep us apprised of his progress

AMELIA
(less than thrilled)
Of course your majesty

KING HIERON II
Enjoy your homecoming Archimedes
And remember the lives of every
Syracusan including your own is
in your hands

INT ARCHIMEDES APARTMENTS - SYRACUSE - NIGHT

A young page DAMIPPUS opens the door for
Archimedes and then follows him in with his things

ARCHIMEDES
My first workshop

He wanders the room Finds a toy that looks like a large
screw He twirls it watching the spiral

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
This was given to me by an artist
my father knew Simple Elegant
An expression of eternal motion

Damippus brings in and rolls out the enormous designs of
the ship Archimedes looks at the designs

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
Do you think you could start a
fire for me I need to burn those

DAMIPPUS
Sir

ARCHIMEDES
It’s impossible That ship would
be far too heavy to pull to sea

DAMIPPUS
Do you have to pull it sir

Archimedes holds back a snarky comment Thinks Does he

ARCHIMEDES
You make a fair point Damippus

Damippus grins delighted

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
But I’d still like a fire It’s
cold as death in here

Damippus nods and jumps to it Archimedes grabs a quill -
one that hasn’t been used in years Begins to work

EXT A SYRACUSAN PLAIN NEAR THE SEA - DAYS LATER

WORKERS place smoothed round trees under the SKELETON OF
A LARGE SHIP Archimedes observes nearby A WORKER looks
to him They are ready Archimedes nods the go-ahead

The workers grab ropes pull the skeleton of the ship
over the logs which roll It looks like it’s working

But the logs do not roll straight - they are separating
too far Suddenly the ship falls in between Cracking

ARCHIMEDES
Stop

Too late - the structure falls over and breaks He sighs

AMELIA
(surprising him)
It will certainly be large

ARCHIMEDES
I never lie when it comes to size

AMELIA
But are you sure it will perform

ARCHIMEDES
If I can get it to water

PRINCE HIERONYMOUS (0S)
Cousin

PRINCE HIERONYMOUS lopes up the hill to them He is
a privileged son in a rich city and knows only pleasure

ARCHIMEDES
Who is this full grown man The
Prince Hieronymous I remember was
but seven years of age

PRINCE HIERONYMOUS
For a mathematician you are lousy
at counting the passage of time
(embraces him)

Come I wish to hear all the
gossip of Alexandria

ARCHIMEDES
That would be marvelous--

AMELIA
--but he cannot He is moving too
slowly with your father’s task and
needs to dedicate himself

PRINCE HIERONYMOUS
For the ship It is kind of you
cousin to humor the old man and
his imaginary war

AMELIA
Archimedes takes it seriously He
promised to build the ship twice
the size of the original plans

PRINCE HIERONYMOUS
Can you do that

ARCHIMEDES
I have to now don’t I

Hieronymous laughs as he walks away

PRINCE HIERONYMOUS
I too must finish what I started
or rather the bottle I started

ARCHIMEDES
Before you go ruining all of my
evenings Amelia consider that
wine might be exactly what I need
to unloosen my brain

AMELIA
I have seen you lift the sun with
your fingertips Surely a ship is
no challenge

She departs Archimedes thinks over her words Grabbing a
stick - he draws the Sun from his planetarium on the
ground Traces the triangle the HINGES and ROPES formed
Draws out a larger TRIANGLE A FULCRUM That’s it

EXT AMELIA’S FRONT DOOR - DAYS LATER

Archimedes knocks insistently on a large wooden door
Senator Sacchus answers

SENATOR SACCHUS
Archimedes

ARCHIMEDES
I’m here for your daughter

SENATOR SACCHUS
I beg your pardon

Amelia guides her father out of the way

AMELIA
Shouldn’t you be working

ARCHIMEDES
How much do you weigh

INT ARCHIMEDES WORKSHOP - LATER

Archimedes’ apartments have become crowded with math
instruments scribbled notes and crumpled scrolls Amelia
notes the evidence of his work with some surprise

Archimedes places her on the seat of a very small
catapult On the other side he stacks STONES

AMELIA
This is truly your most bizarre
attempt at procrastination

As he places more stones she starts to lift

ARCHIMEDES
Good gods woman you lied

He adds one more stone She pops up quickly

AMELIA
(terrified)
Archimedes

But she is not catapulted out of her seat The stones and
she are balanced like scales He pushes on the end with
the stones and Amelia swings from side to side easily

AMELIA (CONTD)
This is incredible Is it a ride
for children

He pushes harder and she swings all the way around to
him He catches her with his arms She hovers close

ARCHIMEDES
Small children And large ships

AMELIA
I admit it I am impressed

She jumps off of the catapult seat

ARCHIMEDES
No wait

The side with the stones comes crashing down Breaking
the catapult She gives him an apologetic look

AMELIA
Sorry

ARCHIMEDES
Now you owe me lunch

EXT SYRACUSE - STREETS - DAY

Amelia lugs a heavy basket as she follows Archimedes He

is distracted searching the streets for something

AMELIA
I apologize for ruining your toy
but this punishment is cruel

ARCHIMEDES
What punishment You get to share
lunch with a genius Ah here

He directs her to a small courtyard Against one wall
an enormous painted-tile fresco of a seashell Amelia
takes it in while Archimedes unpacks their lunch

AMELIA
Whose is this

ARCHIMEDES
An artist who lived in this square
decades ago The segments
consistently get smaller by a
third every time Do you see

AMELIA
It appears infinite

ARCHIMEDES
It gave me ideas Some of my best

Amelia smiles charmed Pours the wine
AMELIA

I must admit that I misjudged you
Your construction is an impressive

advancement

ARCHIMEDES
Let us hope that is enough For
Syracuse

They clink glasses

is

AMELIA
For Syracuse

Suddenly DAMIPPUS races to them Ruining the moment A
LETTER is in his hand

DAMIPPUS
It’s from Rome

Archimedes tears it open Recognizes the writing
ARCHIMEDES
Marcellus
(reading)
Hannibal nears Rome Marcellus
leads an army to stop them

AMELIA
Let us pray he succeeds

ARCHIMEDES
And survives

Amelia takes Archimedes’ hand He feels the electricity
of their touch He squeezes her hand reassuringly

We move away from them Away from Syracuse To the sea
We move along the water hundreds of miles to ITALY
Zooming along the countryside we arrive at NOLA a small
town north of Rome

EXT PLAINS SURROUNDING NOLA - DAY

A fearsome ARMY rides a mixture of horses and ELEPHANTS
away from a burning town It is clear this conquering

militia has left nothing alive in their wake

At the center atop the largest elephant rides HANNIBAL
His face unseen covered by his helmet with curved horns

They ride toward NOLA A small town with humble gates
The Romans inside are doomed
EXT NOLA COURTYARD - DAY

Inside ROMAN SOLDIERS evacuate the PEOPLE OF NOLA out
the back of the town

ROMAN SOLDIER
(to a Nolan)
Take only what you can run with

The last Nolans are guided out and the gates are locked

AT THE FRONT GATE

Roman soldiers watch the Carthaginians march closer The
LIEUTENANT of the Romans turns to the MAN next to him

ROMAN LIEUTENANT
Our presence is unknown

The man next to him reveals himself It is MARCELLUS In
full battle gear Their captain Tense and ready

MARCELLUS
Let us hope Hannibal hates
surprises

He nods to an ARCHER The Archer lights an ARROW on fire
using a fire horn and shoots it up into the sky

AT THE BACK GATE

ROMAN SOLDIERS see the ARROW They open the gates and
pour out the back of Nola en masse

NEAR HANNIBAL

CARTHAGINIAN SOLDIERS spot the ARROW in the sky Point

INSIDE NOLA’S FRONT GATE

The small retinue at the FRONT with Marcellus pulls open
the front gates and attacks

It’s a suicide run Marcellus’ small group attacking
Hannibal’s army head-on

Surprised the CAPTAIN of the Carthage force looks to
Hannibal Hannibal NODS The Captain spurs his horse
leading an attack on the small Roman force

The Romans are insanely outnumbered but fight bravely

Marcellus JUMPS at the Carthaginian Captain on his horse
pulling him to the ground The Captain rises and engages
with Marcellus He laughs at the tiny Roman army

CARTHAGINIAN CAPTAIN
This is the best Rome has to
offer Pathetic

MARCELLUS
I hoped you would think so

The Captain pulls a SECOND SWORD and attacks Marcellus
barely defends himself Grabs a SPEAR and fights with
SWORD AND SPEAR He SKEWERS the Captain with the spear
44

MARCELLUS (CONTD)
(to his Lieutenant)
Now

The Roman Lieutenant finishes off a Carthaginian and
pulls out an ARROW LIGHTS it FIRES it into the air

NEAR NOLA

From a bird’s eye view Marcellus’ plan is clear The
bulk of his army waits on both sides of Nola hidden

Marcellus’ TROOPS see the ARROW from either side of Nola
and kick their horses racing to the battle

MARCELLUS

Smiles to see Carthaginians swivel to defend themselves
from the remainder of the Roman army Too late The Roman
troops quickly flank the Carthage soldiers

CARTHAGINIAN CAPTAIN
(spitting blood)
Bah A few extra Romans cannot
stop our elephants

ARCHERS from atop an enormous ELEPHANT pick off the Roman
Soldiers An advantage that could turn the tide

Marcellus sheathes his sword Grabs the REINS of the
Carthaginian Captain’s HORSE Swings up into the saddle
PULLS the SPEAR from the Captain’s gut

MARCELLUS
(spurs the horse)
Hah

CHARGES toward the ELEPHANT that carries the Archers

MARCELLUS (CONTD)
FOR ROME

Time slows as he SPEARS the Elephant in the shoulder
Unlike a battle horse that is trained for war the
elephant freaks the fuck out Bucks into the air - its
front feet lifting dangerously above Marcellus’ head

Twists in the air and lands turned around Runs--
--Right into Hannibal’s entire cavalry
Mass PANDEMONIUM breaks out The panicking elephant

charges at horse elephant and Carthaginian alike Ranks
are broken horses trampled and elephants scattered

MARCELLUS

Roman Soldiers CHEER at the devastation Marcellus spies
HANNIBAL barely able to control his own elephant

Hannibal looks up Appears to SEE Marcellus After a
moment of hesitation he turns his elephant around
RETREATS as fast as he can The Carthaginians follow

The Romans cheer But not Marcellus

MARCELLUS
He is getting away

ROMAN LIEUTENANT
Let him run All the way back to
Carthage

Marcellus attempts to follow on his horse But he cannot
He stops Watches the Carthaginian Army escape

The Roman Lieutenant catches up to Marcellus

ROMAN LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
Rejoice Captain We have won

MARCELLUS
We have won only time And lost
the advantage

He tosses his HELMET in aggravation

EXT ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Hannibal’s army slows their hasty retreat Hannibal
descends from his elephant shaking with rage

A Carthaginian LIEUTENANT rushes to him

CARTHAGE LIEUTENANT
General we lost half our
elephants crossing the Alps What
supplies we have left were greatly
reduced in the chaos As it
stands we cannot win--

Hannibal unsheathes a wicked sword and BEHEADS the man
He turns to his elephant Ready to take its head as well

HIPPOCRATES (0S)
Honored General

Hannibal pauses HIPPOCRATES the sinister Carthaginian
from the Alexandrian prisons steps forward EPICYDES
his hulking brother hovers behind him

HIPPOCRATES (CONTD)
With you we cannot lose All that
is needed are ships of supplies
The port city of Syracuse was once
loyal to Carthage Isolate her
from her friends and she will be
allied with us once more

Hannibal considers this Using the tip of his blade he
lifts and throws his dead Lieutenant’s sword in the air
Hippocrates catches it Grins

HIPPOCRATES (CONTD)
(bows his head)
It will be done

The sound of a MILLION JUBILANT VOICES brings us back to--

EXT SYRACUSE - PORT - DAY

Syracusans jostle each other outside the front gates of
Syracuse for a better view of the PORT

On the plains next to the sea the enormous finished
ship - THE SYRACUSIAN - sits proudly on the grass

Next to it a GIANT CATAPULT waits It is different from
a typical catapult It has what looks to be an enormous
CLAW - palm down - at its head

Near the Catapult Archimedes Amelia King Hieron
Hieronymous and Syracusan Senators wave to the crowd

AMELIA
(sotto to Archimedes)
Will it work

ARCHIMEDES
There is no other way to test it
than to try

King Hieron addresses the CROWD

KING HIERON II
Citizens of Syracuse Today our
Archimedes performs the
impossible He will bring a ship
that no amount of men or cattle
can move to water A ship that
will make Syracuse proud A ship
that will bring us peace

The crowd cheers The King turns to Archimedes
KING HIERON II (CONT’D)

Make a fool of me nephew and you
will feel my displeasure

ARCHIMEDES
Your confidence inspires Uncle

Archimedes steps forward motions to WORKERS at the ship

The Workers lower the head of the catapult over the top
of the ship The FINGERS of the claw are attached to
supports all along the deck

At the other end of the catapult’s lever Workers load
HUGE HEAVY BRICKS into a LARGE BASKET

The Workers on the ship signal Archimedes They are done
The Workers on the catapult continue to add bricks

AMELIA
Is itworking

ARCHIMEDES
Not yet

The balance of Bricks-to-Ship starts to even The basket
of bricks starts to sink With a terrifying GROAN the
ship barely LIFTS from the ground The Crowd gasps

SENATOR SACCHUS
By the gods

More Bricks and the Ship lifts completely off the plain

ARCHIMEDES
Allow me

Because of the perfectly positioned lever and the
perfectly balanced weight the ship is light as air

Pushing the basket with one hand Archimedes swings the
boat from the plains to over the sea He turns and smiles
at his audience They are shocked out of their minds

PRINCE HIERONYMOUS
Fantastic trick cousin

ARCHIMEDES
(to a worker)
Have them take bricks out of the
basket Slowly We don’t want to
break the eighth wonder of the
world do we

He grins at Amelia She cannot help but grin back

EXT THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA - NIGHT

“The Syracusian” a ship that impresses in every way
cuts through the Mediterranean waves bound for Egypt

Archimedes and Amelia are alone at the prow She
instructs him in sword combat They breathe heavily

AMELIA
Push too far forward and you’1ll be
unbalanced

ARCHIMEDES

I thought victory was all thrust
He slices at her she easily avoids and trips him

AMELIA
I assure you there is much more
to it than just your hips

She retires her sword grabs two goblets of wine
Archimedes pulls himself up Takes one from her

ARCHIMEDES
(indicates the sky)
Have you ever wondered where the
stars go when the moon is full

AMELIA
Where do they go

ARCHIMEDES
They are jealous of the moon’s
beauty when she smiles so they
leave her But her beauty can be
stolen with this

He takes out a small MIRROR and uses it to reflect the
moonlight into her eyes She laughs Pushes him away

AMELTA
I can only imagine how many women
that philosophy has worked on

ARCHIMEDES
You do not trust me

AMELIA
Syracuse is betting her future on
you already Isn’t that enough

ARCHIMEDES
And you think Hieron is mistaken
I know You have made that clear

AMELIA
No Archimedes I am proud of you

ARCHIMEDES
I could not have done it without
you You are my muse

AMELIA
(stunned)
Your muse

ARCHIMEDES
My everything

He leans in for a kiss She allows it He throws his cup
over the side She laughs does the same They embrace

EXT TEMPLE OF EFDU - PORT - DAY

The Syracusian is welcomed to this newly constructed city
with a lavish Egyptian celebration DANCING GIRLS FIRE
EATERS and other PERFORMERS lead a PARADE King Hieron
Prince Hieronymous Archimedes Amelia and their retinue
are led onto a golden parade float and plied with wine

Sexy women drape garlands of gold-encrusted leaves over
their heads Archimedes and Amelia laugh at each other

The parade winds its way toward the TEMPLE

INT TEMPLE OF EFDU - RECEIVING ROOM - LATER

Archimedes and the other Syracusans are led into an
enormous beautiful room covered in hieroglyphics SLAVES
work tirelessly The Temple is decades from finished

At the center of the impressive room sits the teenaged
PHARAOH PTOLEMY IV on a resplendent cushion His
loyal guardian ADVISOR SHEKTAT (30s) stands at his side

PHARAOH PTOLEMY IV
It is a good omen you arrive on
the day of our Festival for Horus
who we honor with this temple

KING HIERON II
You honor us mighty Pharaoh with
the generosity of your time

The Pharaoh nods to Shektat He claps his hands and
Slaves rush to help the Syracusans to cushions

PHARAOH PTOLEMY IV
Your ship is unlike any I have
ever seen Who built it

KING HIERON II
A Syracusan your eminence
Archimedes

PHARAOH PTOLEMY IV
Ar-chi-me-des Greek for Master of
Thought

ARCHIMEDES
Indeed your utmost holiness

PHARAOH PTOLEMY IV
I have little use for learning My
father started this temple as a
record for the Egyptian way of
life Our culture our wisdom it
is all being copied here

(indicates walls)

But this is ridiculous Everyone
already knows who we are

ADVISOR SHEKTAT
Perhaps your father thought it
would benefit future generation--

The Pharaoh silences Shektat with a poisonous look In a
burst of rage he kicks a SLAVE tripping him He laughs
his good mood returning Archimedes hides his disgust

PHARAOH PTOLEMY IV
It gives the Slaves work That is
something I suppose
(to Hieron)
The ship It is for me

KING HIERON II
A gift of friendship To symbolize
brotherhood between our nations

ADVISOR SHEKTAT
A greater gift has never been
seen
(hesitates)
If it pleases the Pharaoh

PHARAOH PTOLEMY IV
It pleases me

A wave of relief passes through the Syracusans

KING HIERON II
In this age when hasty generals
from Carthage wish to bring back
war friendship is very important
to Syracuse

PHARAOH PTOLEMY IV
I understand Let us drink to our
brotherhood And to peace

Glasses of wine are distributed King Hieron salutes
Archimedes with his glass Archimedes nods back Proud

KING HIERON II
To brotherhood And pea--

He is suddenly interrupted by announcement HORNS blaring

PHARAOH PTOLEMY IV
Are more Syracusans expected

ADVISOR SHEKTAT
No my liege

Striding into the room wearing armor so brightly gilded
they are blinding come HIPPOCRATES and EPYCIDES

A Carthaginian HERALD rushes ahead and plants himself

CARTHAGE HERALD
Announcing the arrival of
Hippocrates Captain of Hannibals
armies Announcing Epycides Co-
captain of Hannibal’s armies
Brother to Hippocrates

Hippocrates’ eyes flit over to Archimedes Then back

HIPPOCRATES
Holiest Pharaoh Allow Carthage to
offer her present to Horus on this
most blessed of days

TWO FILTHY MEN in chains are pushed forward

HIPPOCRATES (CONT’D)
These men wish to marry the same
woman They have brought their
suit to me for a decision

The two men are unchained and given WEAPONS The
Syracusans look worried The Pharoah - intrigued

HIPPOCRATES (CONTD)
Let it be settled

Soldiers holding the two men release them They lunge at
each other ducking and stabbing they slice at each
other until one is fatally wounded The Pharoah APPLAUDS

EPICYDES
Hold

Soldiers grab the victorious man Hippocrates takes the
winner’s sword and offers it to the Pharaoh

HIPPOCRATES
Our gift

Gingerly the Pharoah steps to the wounded man Raises
the sword and ENDS the wretch Archimedes is horrified

PHAROAH PTOLEMY IV
I am pleased Come

Hippocrates and Epycides are given wine and seated

HIPPOCRATES
(re Hieron)
I see the Pharaoh accepts slaves
of Rome in his temple You are too
charitable my liege

KING HIERON II
You insult Rome and Egypt herself
when you insult a Syracusan

HIPPOCRATES
Rome will soon be conquered As we
speak Hannibal’s army grows

(to the Pharaoh)

When Hannibal rules the Romans and
unites the Greeks he will reward
those who showed him friendship
And devastate his enemies

PHARAOH PTOLEMY IV
Your leader demonstrates much
aggression

HIPPOCRATES
It is the only way to lead Don’t
you agree

The Pharaoh smiles cruelly He agrees

INT TEMPLE HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT

Slaves lead the Syracusans to their sleeping quarters
Hieron and Amelia argue quietly at the front of the line
In the back Archimedes is suddenly joined by Shektat

ADVISOR SHEKTAT
Do not put your faith in the
Pharaoh

ARCHIMEDES
(politic)
An alliance will benefit us both
I’m sure

ADVISOR SHEKTAT
He is fickle Quick to anger As
his Advisor every sunrise I see I
expect will be my last Your room

Shektat indicates a door Walks away Archimedes looks to
Amelia but she disappears into the King’s chambers

Archimedes enters his room alone Shuts the door

INT ARCHIMEDES ROOM - MORNING

LOUD KNOCKING suddenly startles Archimedes awake

INT HIERON’S LIVING QUARTERS - LATER

Archimedes is shown into Hieron’s room Amelia is helping
the King with breakfast He has never looked so old

ARCHIMEDES
Your highness

KING HIERON II
The Pharaoh will not declare an
alliance with Syracuse

ARCHIMEDES
And that is all there is

KING HIERON II
That is all We shall return to
Syracuse To prepare our defenses
(beat)
What are your thoughts concerning
your cousin Hieronymous

ARCHIMEDES
Hehas his father’s zest for
life

KING HIERON II
I am afraid I am no longer the
conquering warrior My life has
nearly run its course

AMELIA
No your majesty

KING HIERON II
Archimedes I worry Hieronymous is
not ready for what will come He
needs you We all do I will pass
the crown to him when we return
and when I do I will nominate you
to be his Chief Advisor

ARCHIMEDES
A politician

AMELIA
It is a great honor

ARCHIMEDES
It’s a curse You imagine an
Advisor is a helpful guide but in
truth that role is a daily
struggle to coax a king through
adversity while nurturing his ego
for the right to continue living

AMELIA
Archimedes you are needed

ARCHIMEDES
I will not do it

He waits to hear his punishment King Hieron sighs

KING HIERON II
Then I will not ask again Bring
Hieronymous to me

INT TEMPLE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Archimedes exits Hieron’s room his mind racing Seconds
later Amelia exits as well rushes to him

AMELIA
Do not answer so hastily Accept
the nomination Think of the lives
you could save

ARCHIMEDES
What about my life

AMELIA
That is all that concerns you

ARCHIMEDES
Is that really such a surprise

AMELIA
You are a coward

ARCHIMEDES
And you put all the pressure on me
only because you know you are
useless

Amelia is shocked and heart-broken He storms off

INT TEMPLE COURTYARD - LATER

Prince Hieronymous Hippocrates and Epycides are engaged
in a SWORD FIGHT Archimedes sees and races toward them

ARCHIMEDES
Hieronymous

Hieronymous’ sword is knocked from his arm But rather
than look afraid Hieronymous laughs

PRINCE HIERONYMOUS
That was a good move there

HIPPOCRATES
I must teach it to you sometime

ARCHIMEDES
Hieronymous what are you doing

EPYCIDES
He’s having a bit of sport

Archimedes pulls the Prince away

ARCHIMEDES
Your father requests you And he
would not like you exchanging
words with criminals

PRINCE HIERONYMOUS

You are no fun in Egypt
(to the brothers)
Good day my Carthaginian cousins

The Prince saunters into the Temple Hippocrates and
Epycides pack up their swords and gear

HIPPOCRATES
Until next time “Cousin”

They depart Archimedes has no response

EXT TEMPLE OF EFDU - PORT - NEXT DAY

The Syracusans board a MUCH SMALLER boat for their return
trip Archimedes approaches Amelia

ARCHIMEDES
Quite a small boat in exchange for
our gift Greedy little bastard

AMELIA
(frosty )
True friendship is rare And has
not been found on this trip

She turns and leaves him He looks out over the waves

EXT SYRACUSE - DAYS LATER

The royal parade in Syracuse back to the castle is met
with crowds and cheers Hieronymous grins and waves
Archimedes however cannot find a reason to smile

INT SYRACUSE CASTLE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

The CORONATION of Prince Hieronymous is the biggest
celebration Syracuse has ever seen No expense has been
spared on lavish decorations and food

King Hieron uncharacteristically frail takes off his
CROWN and sets it on Hieronymous’ head Hieronymous NOW
KING holds up his arms triumphantly Syracusans cheer

KING HIERONYMOUS

(somewhat drunk)
Great people of Syracuse You are
the best The best in the world
And you deserve the best in your
king I will continue in my
father’s footsteps But I will not
be mired by tradition I will
always do what is best for you
even if that means throwing off
the chains of our greedy “friends”
across the seas for alliances in
Carthage that can offer us so much
more Trust in me Syracuse to
pursue what is best for all of us

Hieronymous takes a big swig of wine There is a
smattering of applause but the Syracusans are shocked by
his words Archimedes looks to Amelia She is pale

KING HIERONYMOUS (CONT’D)
Music Dancing More wine

The music shakily starts back up Amelia leaves

EXT AMELIA’S FRONT DOOR - LATER

Archimedes knocks on Amelia’s door There is no answer
He opens it and enters

INT AMELIA’S HOUSE - SAME

Servants are busy packing up clothing and food items
Amelia instructs them while she helps

AMELIA
Pack the gold cups They will make
for a fine present

ARCHIMEDES
You are leaving Syracuse

Amelia coldly registers Archimedes’ entrance

AMELIA
The senators are traveling to
Leontini Their king’s alliance
with Rome is strong If we can
convince the King of Leontini to
return and speak to Hieronymous
then perhaps our new King will
stop saying things like “Is
Hannibal really that bad”

ARCHIMEDES
You will ride with them

AMELIA
It is a way I can be less
“useless” don’t you agree

ARCHIMEDES
It will be dangerous

AMELIA
Don’t worry you’re not invited
You won’t have to risk a thing
(to a servant)
Show Archimedes to the door

ARCHIMEDES
Amelia--

AMELIA
All I care about is stopping this
war before it’s too late

The Servant indicates to Archimedes to leave He hangs
his head and complies The door is shut hard behind him

INT ARCHIMEDES’ WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Archimedes drafts designs for a large corkscrew device
(The Archimedean Screw used for irrigation to this day)

King Hieron enters the room Damippus jumps up

KING HIERON
Leave us

Damippus exits Hieron appears especially weary
ARCHIMEDES
You are in no condition to be out
of bed Why didn’t you summon me
KING HIERON
I miss this room It has been too

long What are you working on

Hieron supports himself on Archimedes’ table
Hieron’s body suddenly seizes He clutches his chest

ARCHIMEDES
The spiral design lifts water from
deep within the ground Providing
acres of irrigation

KING HIERON
Food production will increase

ARCHIMEDES
Hunger will evaporate

KING HIERON
(beat)

I know you are capable of much
Archimedes But when Hieronymous
breaks our alliance with Rome
Syracuse will have need of you in
the ways of war Any other
endeavor is a waste of time

ARCHIMEDES
It is not too late your highness
Rescind the nomination of
Hieronymous Crown Senator
Sacchus he is loyal to Rome

KING HIERON
(angrily)
Before I became king rulers who
did not inherit the throne by
blood were lucky to last a single
year It will be war either way

sinks against the table Archimedes leaps to his feet

ARCHIMEDES
Damippus

Archimedes eases Hieron to the ground Damippus enters

Damippus’

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
Get help

eyes go wide He rushes away

KING HIERON
Please --

ARCHIMEDES
Do not speak

KING HIERON
For once in your damned life
listen to me Well you know that a
Roman soldier is allowed to
pillage any conquered city

Our art culture and people will
be stolen Enslaved Destroyed As
if we never existed

(grabs Archimedes)
Do not let Rome in

ARCHIMEDES
Uncle I promise

KING HIERON
(relieved)
Your father would be proud

Exhausted Hieron crumples Lies still Archimedes kisses
his forehead Hieron is gone

Soldiers rush in and gather the body Archimedes backs
away Looks at his DESIGN OF THE SCREW Tosses it aside

of rationed venison I would not
have joined you on this trip

AMELIA
Father let me

She urges her horse closer and takes the meat and knife

SENATOR SACCHUS
Such a kind daughter You will
make a man of your choosing very
happy someday

AMELIA
(teases)
What man could possibly be more
worthy than you Father

SENATOR SACCHUS

HIPPOCRATES
Amelia Lovely to see you again
What is the reason for your visit
to Leontini If you seek the King--

EPYCIDES
You just missed him

SENATOR SACCHUS
(outraged)
What have you done

HIPPOCRATES
Us An army led by Marcus
Marcellus did this

AMELIA
You expect us to believe that

HIPPOCRATES
Don’t let the royal blood on my
hands confuse you
(takes out a knife)
See Marcellus’ knife

AMELIA
You stole that from Marcellus in
Alexandria

HIPPOCRATES

I say I found it in the King of
Leontini’s dead body

SENATOR FILLIPUS
We have caught you in the act Why
would we lie for you

CARTHAGINIAN SOLDIERS draw arrows along their bows Aim

HIPPOCRATES
Marcellus stormed Leontini and
murdered everyone in a rage when
they would not betray Hannibal

have done such a terrible thing

SENATOR FILLIPUS
(hesitates)
I hear Marcellus has done it

HIPPOCRATES
You heard

SENATOR FILLIPUS
Isaw with my own eyes

HIPPOCRATES
(feigns shock)
Not the Roman General Marcus
Marcellus

SENATOR FILLIPUS
(gritting his teeth)

waste to this city

The Senators look at each other Four of them raise their
hands in assent Amelia sputters from the ground

Soldiers pull resistant Senators off their horses
Cephales uses the tip of his sword to lift Amelia’s chin

INT SYRACUSE CASTLE - THRONE ROOM - EVENING

King Hieronymous is hosting a wine-soaked party in the
throne room Young Syracusans feast and dance Archimedes
picks at his food concerned

KING HIERONYMOUS
I would like to make a toast

The dancing abruptly ceases and all grab a cup

ARCHIMEDES
(quietly)
Another Hieronymous

KING HIERONYMOUS
To my father He was an excellent
man and king His like will never
be seen within these walls again

The Syracusans ceremoniously drink

ARCHIMEDES
(to Hieronymous )
Perhaps you have honored your
father enough for one evening

KING HIERONYMOUS
(emotional)
He would be upset with me

ARCHIMEDES
No your father loved you And he
knew you would rule this city
well And keep our alliances

KING HIERONYMOUS
You talk of Rome again

ARCHIMEDES
Do not let me speak for it A
Roman I met in Alexandria is
better equipped with the words

KING HIERONYMOUS
A politician

ARCHIMEDES
A soldier Like your father And
mine

KING HIERONYMOUS
His name

ARCHIMEDES
Marcus Marcellus

KING HIERONYMOUS
Send for Marcellus Any friend of
yours would be a welcome advisor

friendship Suddenly the doors to the throne room are
THROWN OPEN and the bedraggled Senators rush inside

What has happened

HIPPOCRATES
(appearing)
King Hieronymous I am happy to
see you though our news is grave

highness By the Roman General
Marcus Marcellus

with their own eyes

SENATORS
AyeIt’s trueI saw it

KING HIERONYMOUS
Marcellus
(to Archimedes)
The man you wanted to bring into
our home

ARCHIMEDES
They must be mistaken

HIPPOCRATES
This knife was buried in the heart
of the King A warning to all who
do not bend to Rome’s will

Hippocrates throws MARCELLUS’ KNIFE into the center of
the throne room Archimedes recognizes it

ARCHIMEDES
(mystified)
It is his knife It bears his
insignia Where is Amelia

HIPPOCRATES
She tried to talk reason into the
brute He killed her instantly

ARCHIMEDES
Amelia is dead

HIPPOCRATES
Do not blame yourself for being
fooled Archimedes He was trained
to deceive

ARCHIMEDES

HIPPOCRATES
Are you so certain his friendship
with you was not merely a
political duty

Archimedes remembers Marcellus’ own confession back in
Alexandria that this was the case He falls silent

EPYCIDES
Syracuse will be next oh wise
King You need our help

KING HIERONYMOUS
Yes of course The time for
feasting is over We hereby
nominate Hippocrates and Epyicdes
as co-heads of our city’s defense

HIPPOCRATES

regard is prudent We humbly
accept

Safely arrived in Syracuse She
is at last returned to Carthage

ROMAN CAPTAIN
It is the seal of Hannibal’s
captain Hippocrates

MARCELLUS

Syracuse has allied with Hannibal
With her seaports at his command
Hannibal will have what he needs

be our orders

ROMAN CAPTAIN
War with Syracuse From what I
hear their art will fetch a fine
price

As should you Get your family out
of here as fast as you can

DAMIPPUS
We would never survive the thieves
on the road

ARCHIMEDES
Then stay Become a Roman when
they conquer Syracuse But first
take this to my horse

He shoves one of his packed bags into Damippus’s arms

DAMIPPUS
The Roman soldiers will take
everything of value My family
will be sold as slaves

ARCHIMEDES
Blame your gods and your fate
then This is a foolish war
between a cadre of imbeciles and
has nothing to do with me

DAMIPPUS
You are the only one who can save
us

ARCHIMEDES

(this stops him)
Amelia would have agreed with you

He picks up the mirror Stares at it Decides

see if she was right

INT SYRACUSE CASTLE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

Rome’s navy at sea and hope to
stop them there

ARCHIMEDES
No Call them home All of them

KING HIERONYMOUS
Bring in all the ships

ARCHIMEDES
The castle plateau is our most
defensible position If we are to
survive we cannot give ground I
learned that from a very smart
man Besides I need the wood

He puts a hand on the map wipes model ships off the sea

EXT DOCK ON MEDITERRANEAN - MARCELLUS’ SHIP - SAME

Marcellus leads his men as they tie GIANT WARSHIPS

Marcellus’ ship sails toward Syracuse All around him

SOLDIERS prepare for war

MARCELLUS
We must attack at full speed all

ROMAN CAPTAIN
An acceptable loss sir

MARCELLUS
A pittance compared to how many
ships will remain

Behind them SCORES OF ROMAN SHIPS stretch along the seas
to the horizon Rome is taking no chances

EXT OUTSIDE SYRACUSE - DAY
WORKERS build more CATAPULTS WITH CLAWS in the fields

ARCHIMEDES (VO)

INSIDE THE PALACE AT THE WAR TABLE - NIGHT

Hieronymous pushes all the figurines off the maps with a
great cry of frustration Hippocrates Epycides a few
Carthaginian SOLDIERS and Archimedes react

KING HIERONYMOUS
This is insane There are too many
of them We cannot win this

HIPPOCRATES
Sire Archimedes has done much to
prepare us--

KING HIERONYMOUS
How gallant of him And stupid
Cousin you do not truly think we
stand a chance

ARCHIMEDES
There is no alternative

KING HIERONYMOUS
Yes there is Surrender

Epycides gives Hippocrates an angry look Hippocrates
shakes his head ‘Not now’

ARCHIMEDES
Surrender to Rome will bring the
same repercussions as defeat

KING HIERONYMOUS
It is better than certain death
Which is what all of you are
planning here not victory

ARCHIMEDES
Hieronymous you are tired--

KING HIERONYMOUS
Do not dare tell your king what he
feels Or what to do If the
Romans are open to a peaceful
resolution I will surrender
Syracuse You can thank me later

HIPPOCRATES
Your highness-

KING HIERONYMOUS
Good night

He storms out of the room

HIPPOCRATES
It is not a treaty the Romans
send but warships

ARCHIMEDES
He will think clearer after sleep
we all will

Archimedes leaves weary The brothers watch him go

EPYCIDES
The King will surrender

HIPPOCRATES

his chin toward where the King exited The soldiers bow
and draw their weapons They follow the King’s path

Secure the ships We are safe here
to attack A few more hits and
she will surrender--

ROMAN CAPTAIN
General look

Marcellus turns and sees boulders arcing through the air
ROMAN CAPTAIN (CONTD)
Impossible We are too close out

of range

MARCELLUS
Stop loading Prepare for impact

Soldiers scramble clumsily Seven boulders find their
targets and smash seven of Marcellus’ fleet to bits

MARCELLUS (CONTD)
We need to get closer
(to his ship)
Race for the wall

Sails are pulled taut Warships launch forward

ARCHIMEDES
Watches the Roman Fleet approach He nods to the Captain

SYRACUSAN CAPTAIN
UNCOVER THE MIRRORS

At the top of the towers Soldiers unveil one of the many

infamous weapons of war Archimedes created PATCHWORKED
MIRRORS LARGER THAN ELEPHANTS that focus sun rays

MARCELLUS

Holds his hand up to his eyes as he is blinded by a
mirror’s light It swivels over him causing a SUNBURN
Looking up he sees the light settle on his main sail

MARCELLUS
What is that--

ROMAN CAPTAIN
A sign from the gods

MARCELLUS
A trick Like one an old friend of
mine might try Ignore it

But it’s no trick The sunlight is focused searing The
sunlit point suddenly BURSTS INTO FLAME

SOLDIER
Fire from Apollo

Soldiers panic as the hungry fire spreads to the mast

ARCHIMEDES
Lets out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding

SYRACUSAN CAPTAIN
It’s working

ARCHIMEDES
Keep changing targets Chaos is
our only hope

Where is Hieronymous This will
return his smile

Mirrors swivel and ignite sails on ship after ship

MARCELLUS

Looks out over his fleet and sees pandemonium More and
more of his precious boats are set ablaze He is losing

MARCELLUS
Signal the retreat

ROMAN CAPTAIN
General

MARCELLUS
(shouting)
Get the surviving ships back away
from Syracuse we need to RETREAT

SNICK SNACK The men look up The mast burnt black
SNAPS Marcellus and the Captain LEAP out of the way

The mast falls SMASHES their enormous CATAPULT to ruins

Marcellus picks himself up and grabs a large RED FLAG He
races to the back of his ship and WAVES it

On other ships SAILORS grab red flags and wave them

ARCHIMEDES

Spots the red from the ramparts Closes his eyes briefly
in relief SOLDIERS cheer The Roman Fleet is retreating

MARCELLUS

Watches his fleet skulk away Throws down his flag in
frustrated rage Around him Soldiers chatter in fear

SOLDIER 1 SOLDIER 2
Syracuse is protected by Apollo’s chariot threw fire
the gods upon us I saw it

ROMAN CAPTAIN
What hope do we have while they
harness the power of the sun

MARCELLUS
We wait for the night

INT ARCHIMEDES APARTMENTS - SYRACUSE - LATER

Archimedes tears through his weapon designs books and
clothing searching for something

The Syracusan Captain bursts into the room jubilant

SYRACUSAN CAPTAIN
You have done it We have won

ARCHIMEDES
They will return After dark

SYRACUSAN CAPTAIN
At night we can only defend
against a few ships They have
hundreds What are we going to do

Archimedes finds his old scary GREEK MASK Smiles
ARCHIMEDES
Cheat
EXT OUT ON THE SEAS - DUSK
On his battered ship Marcellus studies the sky
MARCELLUS
Prepare the ladders This time we
will take no chances
ROMAN CAPTAIN
The men are unnerved sir
(Marcellus glares)
But ready
A few drops of rain splat onto the ship

MARCELLUS
Tonight it ends

The Captain lifts a YELLOW FLAG Other ships raise and
wave YELLOW FLAGS The Roman Fleet moves out
EXT SYRACUSE RAMPARTS - LATER THAT NIGHT

The seas are pitch black Invisible Archimedes inspects
a fire that Soldiers hurriedly build bigger and bigger

ARCHIMEDES
More wood

SYRACUSAN CAPTAIN
Sir these fires are a beacon to
our position

ARCHIMEDES
The Romans are mighty but they
are still men We can use that
against them when they attack

SYRACUSAN CAPTAIN
(squints)
They are already here

A spidery LIGHTNING BOLT suddenly illuminates the ENTIRE
ROMAN FLEET -- only a few hundred meters from the walls

MARCELLUS

Grins through the pounding rain

MARCELLUS
Where are your tricks now

ROMAN CAPTAIN
READY THE LADDERS

Roman Soldiers take positions around insanely long
ladders that lie across the length of the boats

MARCELLUS
LADDERS RISE

As Marcellus’ ship nears the walls the Romans lift
comrades on ladders to the top of the ramparts

Archers shoot at the Romans on top but each ladder is

quickly climbed by several more Other ships follow suit
and ladders go up all over Syracuse

ARCHIMEDES

Turns to see Syracusans cutting down Romans as they
ascend but there are just too many of them

Romans spill out on top of the Syracusan ramparts

ARCHIMEDES
LOWER THE CLAWS NOW

Catapults are lowered over the edge of the Syracusan
walls into the sea Rather than a basket on the end
each catapult is adorned with a HUGE CLAW like the one
that lifted “The Syracusian” but PALM UP

ON THE BOAT

Streaks of lightning reveal the HUGE CLAWS (known through
history as the Claws of Archimedes) splashing in the sea

ROMAN CAPTAIN
What witchcraft is this--

Suddenly MIRRORS next to the FIRES ON THE WALLS are
uncovered Soldiers SWIVEL the mirrors to reflect the
firelight onto a SOLITARY FIGURE standing in the middle
of the ramparts He wears a cloak and the GREEK MASK
MARCELLUS
(sure now)
Archimedes

The Masked Man raises his arms-—-

INSIDE THE WALLS OF SYRACUSE

Syracusan Soldiers waiting for the signal hack at ropes
that hold LARGE BOULDERS above the basket-end of the
catapults Boulders drop onto the ends of the catapults--
MARCELLUS’ SHIP

--On either side of Marcellus FOUR WARSHIPS SUDDENLY
RISE INTO THE AIR OUT OF THE SEA Underneath them
lifting them up are the clawed ends of the catapults
RUNNING ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE CATAPULT

Behind Syracusan walls a dozen soldiers are all it takes
to push the balanced catapults from side to side

ON THE SEAS

The WARSHIPS ARE TOSSED from side to side Terrified
Sailors fall from them screaming

The Masked Man GESTURES with his hands and the Claws
PIVOT SMASHING THE SHIPS INTO ROCKS

TWO SHIPS ARE SMASHED TOGETHER SPLINTERING INTO PIECES

MARCELLUS
Is frozen in shock

Lighter after destroying ships the Claws rise
dramatically into the air ROMANS lose their shit

ROMAN SOLDIER 1 ROMAN SOLDIER 2
We are bound for Hades Poseidon preserve us

Soldiers everywhere abandon ship diving into the water
and swimming away for their lives

MARCELLUS
Stop you fools

But the crashing of thunder drowns him out

ROMAN CAPTAIN
(fighting insanity)
This is no mortal man we fight

Marcellus grabs the Captain’s tunic and pulls him close

MARCELLUS
Archimedes is a clever boy playing
a game He has won the seas But
he will not win the war Get us to
land

The Captain rushes to lead the Sailors in a retreat
Marcellus throws a last angry look at Syracuse

ARCHIMEDES

Watches Marcellus’ ship turn and sail away from the
walls The other Roman Warships follow Archimedes steps
back out of the reflected light and takes off his MASK

ARCHIMEDES
Now stay away Marcus Please

HIPPOCRATES (0S)
Impressive

Archimedes turns to see Hippocrates and Epicydes

ARCHIMEDES
I trust Hieronymous is pleased

HIPPOCRATES
I am afraid while this day was a
success losses were still had

Hippocrates turns to the SOLDIERS below

HIPPOCRATES (CONT’D)
Citizens of Syracuse our brothers
and friends Our great King
Hieronymous has been killed by a
Roman assassin

The soldiers react in shock and sadness Archimedes looks
to the Syracusan Captain confused

ARCHIMEDES
Impossible How could an assassin
have breached our walls

HIPPOCRATES
Epycides and I have decided to co-
rule the city through these dark
days and lead Syracuse to victory

The soldiers cheer and vow to shed Roman blood

Archimedes angers He moves to the wall Grabs a sword
But his arm is stopped by the Captain Hippocrates and
Epicydes bask in the roar of the crowd and do not see

SYRACUSAN CAPTAIN
(sotto voce)
Hold Archimedes--

ARCHIMEDES
Do not try and stop me

SYRACUSAN CAPTAIN
At war you are brilliant But if
you fight these men with your own
hands you will lose And without
you Syracuse will fall

ARCHIMEDES
I will not fight for them

SYRACUSAN CAPTAIN
This war is not about believing in
kings It is survival

Archimedes looks at his people Thousands of them

EXT SICILIAN COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET

Tents are erected by Roman Soldiers Marcellus walks into
the LARGEST TENT High-ranking SOLDIERS follow him in

FURTHER OUT IN THE SICILIAN COUNTRYSIDE - SAME

A LONE RIDER pushes a horse to its limit racing over the
plains The horse foams The Rider is smeared with blood

INT MARCELLUS’ WAR TENT - NIGHT

Maps are spread out on a fur-lined table Goblets and
wine bottles perch on top The soldiers’ mood is tense

MARCELLUS
We did not ask for this war But
we will not fail Rome’s command
Do not succumb to superstition It
is but a man we fight not a god

ROMAN CAPTAIN
Whatever he may be we cannot keep
running blindly into his traps

MARCELLUS
No We need a trick of our own
EXT EDGE OF ROMAN WAR CAMP - SAME
The Rider races toward the camp A SENTRY notices

SENTRY
Hold or be shot

He draws his bow The horse slows to a walk The Rider
exhausted slips off the horse to the ground The Sentry

rushes up to the fallen figure

The hood falls back revealing AMELIA

AMELIA
Take me to your General

INT MARCELLUS’ WAR TENT - MOMENTS LATER
Marcellus moves pieces on the map Soldiers watch

(frustrated)
The approach is open terrain We

will be seen for miles--

Suddenly the Sentry stumbles in Amelia with him

SENTRY
Sir She asked for you

MARCELLUS
Amelia

AMELIA
Marcus

She FAINTS from blood loss and exhaustion

INT MARCELLUS’ WAR TENT - NIGHT

Amelia wakes She is lying in a bed Marcellus is
wrapping a bandage on her arm They are alone

MARCELLUS
I saw What happened

AMELIA
We were captured by Hippocrates

CUT TO

FLASHBACK - LEONTINI PRISON - NIGHT

A Senator is executed by Cephales Amelia is the last
alive trapped in a cell

CEPHALES
Just you and me like I promised

AMELIA (VO)
I had to wait for the right
moment

Cephales unlocks her cell

CEPHALES
Now be a good girl

He pushes her head over the chopping block She slips THE
JERKY KNIFE from her bodice into her hand

CEPHALES (CONTD)
For a delicate flower like you
I’1l make it quick

He raises his sword above his head Amelia lurches up
stabs him in the GROIN He SCREAMS and stumbles She
drives her HAND into his ELBOW and he drops the sword

She grabs the sword Cephales grabs her Bringing the
hilt to his nose she knocks him back Lifts the sword

AMELIA
For Syracuse And my father

She brings it down through his neck

END FLASHBACK
Amelia greedily gulps down wine Her first drink in days

AMELIA

I tried to return home but
Carthaginian scouts were
everywhere I survived in hiding
When I saw your ships I stole a
horse

(sorrowfully)
I got lucky

MARCELLUS
You were smart And brave

AMELIA
Hippocrates blamed the massacre of
Leontini on you He uses that to
control Syracuse We must tell
them the truth And end this

MARCELLUS
Tell who

AMELIA
Archimedes I know a way

MARCELLUS
Archimedes is leading Syracuse
against Rome What good is talk

AMELIA
The truth will change everything
And with him we can end this war

MARCELLUS

(amazed)
We And here I thought the only
fingers a politician ever lifted
were to pull someone else’s
strings I misjudged you

(grabs her hand)
We will speak to Archimedes and
find a solution

AMELIA
And here I thought all soldiers
saw war as the only solution I am
much surprised by you as well And
glad for it

MARCELLUS
Thank you for noticing

AMELIA
Thank you for your compassion

MARCELLUS
You’re welcome

Without thought they drift closer bridging the small
space between them to press their lips together

They break apart just as suddenly
MARCELLUS (CONTD)

Youyou are in need of wine
Food A place to sleep

AMELIA
(flushed)
Yes Thank you

MARCELLUS
And tomorrow we will--

AMELIA
No tonight It must be tonight

MARCELLUS
Tonight Of course Well I shall
ready the horses then

He stands up stiffly and strides out of the tent Amelia
lets out a long breath Exhilarated but confused

EXT THE ROAD TO SYRACUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Two riders gallop toward the walls Amelia and Marcellus

EXT OUTSIDE THE WESTERN WALL OF SYRACUSE - LATER
Amelia and Marcellus creep close but stay hidden

AMELIA
The mirror

MARCELLUS
(hands her a mirror)
How can this reach Archimedes

AMELIA
With the help of a full moon he
will come to us

She reflects the moonlight through a window above--

INT ARCHIMEDES APARTMENTS - SAME

The light darts around the ceiling of Archimedes’ room
Archimedes is awake obsessing over a map of Syracuse

ARCHIMEDES
Here we are masters of the very
war Amelia died to prevent

He takes a deep gulp of wine Notices the glinting light
on the wall Squints at it Is he dreaming

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
Amelia

The light dances then vanishes Archimedes rushes to his
window Sees a CLOAKED FIGURE below The figure WAVES
Archimedes WAVES back runs from the room

OUTSIDE THE WALL

Marcellus steps from the bushes to join Amelia

MARCELLUS
He knows it is you
AMELIA
It is a joke between us He knows
MARCELLUS
You two have becomecloser since

AMELIA

(avoids the question)
Come he will use the Southern
Gate

EXT SOUTHERN GATE OF SYRACUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Amelia and Marcellus wait hidden near the Gate
Suddenly it creaks open A SYRACUSAN SOLDIER exits

MARCELLUS
We have been betrayed--

AMELIA
No wait

The Soldier removes his helmet It is Archimedes

ARCHIMEDES
Amelia

AMELIA
(reveals herself)
I knew you would come

ARCHIMEDES
Youre alive
(embraces her)
Hippocrates told us you were
killed by--

Marcellus reveals himself Archimedes pushes Amelia
behind him Draws a sword

MARCELLUS
Come now we both know you’re
useless with that
ARCHIMEDES
What is he doing here

AMELIA
I brought him To end this

ARCHIMEDES
(reluctantly agrees)
Step inside If an archer sees us
out here it would certainly ruin
the evening for all of us

He turns leads them inside the Gate

INT SOUTHERN GATE OF SYRACUSE - SAME
Archimedes latches the GATE Marcellus whispers
MARCELLUS

Rome will never stop We have
supplies for years of siege

ARCHIMEDES
Then we will beat you on the
battlefield

MARCELLUS

Don’t be ridiculous--

AMELIA
Boys None of our actions started
this war But we are the ones who
can stop it We must work
together bring down Hippocrates
and Epycides tonight and proclaim
loyalty to Rome

MARCELLUS
No Rome will not trust any
Syracusan monarch now The city
must be conquered

ARCHIMEDES
So we remain at an impasse

MARCELLUS
Not at all Bloodshed can still be
avoided Surrender Open the gates
to admit my soldiers

ARCHIMEDES
No

MARCELLUS
AMELIA
Roman soldiers are awarded “spoils
of war” for their service even in
surrender--

ARCHIMEDES
(overlapping)
--any conquered citizen can be
enslaved any riches stolen-

NERVOUS SOLDIER (0S)
Who goes there

The trio suddenly freezes Archimedes gestures they
follow him They squeeze inside a narrow alley

INT DARK ALLEY BEHIND THE GATE - SAME
They shuffle and squeeze along following Archimedes

MARCELLUS

(whispers)
Spoils of war is what soldiers
risk their lives for It is how
Rome repays their service No one
can change that If I tried they
would turn on me But you need not
die You have clearly shown your
importance and Rome would gladly
patronize your work You would be
made very comfortable

EXT BACKYARD NEAR THE ALLEY - SAME
They exit into a small yard Crouch in the shadows

ARCHIMEDES
But Syracuse would be scattered to
the winds Her art her history
and her people destroyed

MARCELLUS
It is the way of war

ARCHIMEDES
It is not my way I am all that
Syracuse has and I will defend
her unto my death

MARCELLUS
(matter-of-fact)
I could kill you now

ARCHIMEDES
You could

They stare at each other Marcellus smiles
MARCELLUS
I suspected you would become a
great man someday Archimedes

ARCHIMEDES
I had a good tutor

FOOTSTEPS are suddenly heard nearby The trio ducks
ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
Go back the way we came I will
get rid of the guards so you can
leave safely
MARCELLUS
(to Amelia)
Are you coming with me
ARCHIMEDES
(surprised)
With you

AMELIA
I am staying

MARCELLUS
-are you sure

Archimedes can tell Marcellus wishes to say more He gets
a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach

AMELIA
This is where I belong

MARCELLUS
So be it

He disappears back into the alley Archimedes frowns

AMELIA
Archimedes I--

ARCHIMEDES
Wait here

He darts around the corner toward the Southern Gate

INT DARK ALLEY BEHIND THE GATE - MOMENTS LATER

Marcellus pushes past the bricks positioning himself at
the mouth of the alley ready to exit quickly

His hand accidentally PUSHES A BRICK OUT OF THE WALL

EXT SOUTHERN GATE OF SYRACUSE - SAME

The BRICK plops to the dirt outside the wall This is the
Gate that got a beating from the Roman warship catapult
NEAR THE GATE

The NERVOUS SOLDIER suddenly returns He heard Marcellus
He approaches the dark alley Closer closer

ARCHIMEDES
(suddenly appears)
Good evening

The Nervous Soldier pivots but brings his weapon down

SOLDIER
General I thought I heard
something

ARCHIMEDES

You did We have a Roman spy here
trying to break in
IN THE ALLEY

Marcellus stiffens Is Archimedes about to give him up

NEAR THE GATE

ARCHIMEDES
A Man was seen running away from
the Northern Gate Report there to
assist the other soldiers

SOLDIER
At once

The Soldier exits Archimedes opens the Southern Gate
Marcellus comes out of hiding Stands next to Archimedes

MARCELLUS
(re the war)
I cannot stop

ARCHIMEDES
Neither can I

Marcus offers an arm in friendship Archimedes grasps it

EXT OUTSIDE THE SOUTHERN GATE - MOMENTS LATER

Marcellus mounts his horse Takes a look at the wall
Bricks jut out all the way up SOMETHING TO REMEMBER

MARCELLUS
Hah

He kicks his horse and gallops off into the night

INT ARCHIMEDES APARTMENTS - SAME
Archimedes watches Marcellus depart from his window

AMELIA
I don’t like hiding

ARCHIMEDES
Youre dead If Hippocrates hears
you’re wandering the streets he
just might try to kill you again

AMELIA
We should assassinate the brothers
tonight

ARCHIMEDES

That would only cause civil war
There is no clear heir

AMELIA
Hieronymous

ARCHIMEDES
Dead
(beat)
Is that the only reason you wanted
to stay with me To kill them

AMELIA
Foremost in my mind is that none
of us will even survive the
‘morrow Thoughts of anything
elsecan wait

ARCHIMEDES
(sits at his table)
Fine Take the bed I have work to
do After all Marcellus will try
to kill us in the morning

AMELIA
Good night

He nods tightly She slips into his bedroom After a
moment he throws down his instruments Pours himself a
large glass of wine “Toasts” the shut bedroom door

FADE TO WHITE

EXT SYRACUSE CASTLE - THE SKY - DAY

A flaming BOULDER arcs through the bright clear sky in
slow motion a deadly yet entrancing object

It speeds up and SMASHES into the NORTHERN WALL of
Syracuse Syracusan soldiers on the wall are VAULTED into
the air or BURIED in the rubble

ARCHIMEDES dirty and sweaty runs along the wall

ARCHIMEDES
RELEASE

SOLDIERS at CATAPULTS -- pointed over the Northern Wall --

HACK at ropes Weights release the side of each catapult
over the wall FALLS dropping BOULDERS onto the field

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

The enormous BOULDERS roll downhill from the fortress
RIGHT ON TOP OF THE ATTACKING ROMAN ARMY

ROMAN SOLDIERS try to jump out of the boulders’ paths
but are MOWED DOWN Horses panic breaking up army lines

The Roman Captain rallies those the boulders missed

ROMAN CAPTAIN
To the wall Every Roman

SOLDIERS
For Rome

The Captain slows when he sees TALL THIN POLES being
raised just inside Syracuse’s walls

ROMAN CAPTAIN
What trick is this

A SILVER HOOK flashes out over the army attached to a
nearly-invisible thin rope on the pole

The HOOK sinks into a SOLDIER’s leg near the Captain

SPEARED SOLDIER
Captain

The Soldier SCREAMS as the hook RETRACTS at whip-like
speed He is YANKED up and thrown through the air

ROMAN CAPTAIN
By the gods

Several ominous WHISTLING sounds fill the air as hook
after hook launches out and snags Roman Soldiers
spearing them and lofting them several stories high

ON THE NORTHERN WALL

Archimedes orchestrates the chaos He yells to the men at
the enormous poles that launch the silvery hooks

ARCHIMEDES
Again

Soldiers rush to relaunch Archimedes scans the fields

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
Where is he

SYRACUSAN CAPTAIN
Many ships were lost Marcellus
might’ve drowned at sea

ARCHIMEDES
No He should be leading them but
I see no standard No General’s
armorSomething is wrong

OUTSIDE THE SOUTHERN WALL

Relatively quiet compared to the skirmish at the North
the Southern wall is mostly unattended

From behind nearby bushes MARCELLUS and three ROMAN
LIEUTENANTS sneakily approach the wall

MARCELLUS
The bulk of the army has done its
job admirably Syracuse does not
even look our way

ROMAN LIEUTENANT 1
But what can we do from here
General

MARCELLUS
(rubs the wall)
These bricks were loosened by our
catapult attack We climb

He sticks a KNIFE between his teeth and starts to climb
by PULLING OUT LOOSE BRICKS making handholds

The other Romans follow him Slowly they ascend

TOP OF THE SOUTHERN WALL

THREE SYRACUSAN SOLDIERS stand transfixed by the battle
to the North Behind them MARCELLUS raises himself up

Hearing Marcellus one Soldier turns but he is too slow
Marcellus spits his knife into a free hand and ends him

The others are dispatched by the Roman Lieutenants

MARCELLUS
Not too much blood on their
clothes Careful

They strip the Syracusan soldiers and don their clothing

MARCELLUS (CONTD)
(proud of disguise)
You are not the only one with
tricks Archimedes Follow me

The two Lieutenants in Syracusan outfits run after
Marcellus The remaining Roman disposes of the bodies

ON TOP OF THE NORTHERN WALL
Archimedes’ weapons are making a dent in the Roman Army

SYRACUSIAN CAPTAIN
The catapults are reloaded sir

ARCHIMEDES
Release

Boulders and Hooks again massacre dozens in seconds

HIPPOCRATES
(suddenly appearing)
My my Archimedes Who knew what
a deadly man you would become

ARCHIMEDES
The battle is not yet won

HIPPOCRATES
And a magnificent battle it is

ARCHIMEDES

(sickened)

I see now that Marcellus was
right Peace is inevitable

HIPPOCRATES
Because together we shall conquer
the world

ARCHIMEDES

Because men like me will some day
make weapons that no man can bear
witness

HIPPOCRATES
Let me know when they have given

up

Archimedes glares at Hippocrates as he descends the wall

EXT COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Hippocrates moves through Syracuse A FIGURE IN A CLOAK
AND GREEK MASK breaks out of hiding and FOLLOWS

INT SYRACUSE CASTLE - THRONE ROOM - SAME
Hippocrates strides through Sensing a noise he pauses

The CLOAKED FIGURE IN A GREEK MASK slides behind a
pillar barely concealed before Hippocrates turns around

Hippocrates’ turns his back the Cloaked Figure draws a
sword and raises it up--

Hippocrates whirls with his sword blocking the attack

HIPPOCRATES
Bad form Archimedes Shouldn’t
you wait until the war is won
before you seize the throne

He shoves the Figure back they fightevenly matched

HIPPOCRATES (CONT’D)
Either you have been taking
lessons or it is not Archimedes I
fight

He trips the Cloaked Figure As the assailant falls to
the ground the cloak slips off her head Amelia

AMELIA
It’s not stealing the throne if I
take it from a thief

HIPPOCRATES
Didn’t I kill you already

AMELIA
Only my father

She pops up and attacks Hippocrates ferociously Without
the hindrance of the hood she is besting him

HIPPOCRATES
Wait -- I have riches

AMELIA
You have nothing that will not be
taken by me Including your life

She moves to BEHEAD Hippocrates but is suddenly body
slammed by EPYCIDES She hits a pillar hard

EPYCIDES
Good night

He raises his sword to kill her--

HIPPOCRATES
Hold Archimedes is no true friend
of ours but for her life he will
pledge loyalty to Hannibal

AMELIA
I will gut you like a fish

She makes a wild stab at the brothers but Epycides a
large bear of a man grabs her and ties her up

HIPPOCRATES
If she is here it is likely she
told Archimedes about Leontini
(thinks it over)
Keep her close There is one more
thing we need to insure our
safety

Epycides nods Hippocrates hurriedly exits

Marcellus and his Lieutenants rush through the soldiers
Hedging around a catapult they run into ARCHIMEDES

(hands him a bag)
Get more arrows to the ramparts

He nods and moves away The other two follow Distracted
Archimedes rushes on none the wiser

supplies up to the ramparts A SOLDIER among them notices
the disguised MARCELLUS and his men running toward them

Just in time We need men on the--

Marcellus’ sword leaps into his hand and with the drawing
move he slices the throat of the Soldier

try to defend themselves against the Lieutenants but are
cut down One is left He attempts to get help

Panting the Captain runs to Archimedes

ARCHIMEDES
You are needed at the North--

SYRACUSIAN CAPTAIN
The gate has been opened sir The
Romans are inside

Archimedes’ face pales He rushes up the nearest stairs
to the top of the ramparts What he sees is his worst
fear The Romans are spilling in by the dozens

ARCHIMEDES
They will overwhelm us

SYRACUSIAN CAPTAIN
Ill send every man--

ARCHIMEDES
No Tell them to go home

SYRACUSIAN CAPTAIN
Home

ARCHIMEDES
To their families To protect them

tight Carthaginians rush toward the window as the
curtain unfolds It SNAPS TIGHT and YANKS the TABLE to
the window knocking the Carthaginians over

OUTSIDE

Archimedes slides down the curtain toward the ground

INSIDE

Epycides draws his sword Slices the curtain
OUTSIDE

Archimedes plummets Lands hard but is okay Looks at
the ground war in front of him RUNS RIGHT INTO IT

He dives out of the way of Roman SWORDS--
Shimmies his way in between two SOLDIERS hand-fighting--

Grabs a shield from a downed Soldier to defend himself
from a ROMAN CAVALRYMAN--

Ducks into an alley to outrun a BLOODTHIRSTY ROMAN--

Until he spies the man he seeks MARCELLUS larger than
life cutting down Syracusan Soldiers like a god

ARCHIMEDES
Marcellus

Yelling will do no good in this crowded battle He grabs
a sword and dives into the middle of the action

A ROMAN attacks him Archimedes defends But not well
enough The Roman aims to kill -- suddenly the SYRACUSAN
CAPTAIN leaps in to block the blow

ARCHIMEDES (CONT’D) SYRACUSIAN CAPTAIN
I told you to escape You should not be here

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
I need to get to Marcellus

SYRACUSIAN CAPTAIN
Don’t we all

Together the two of them fight their way to the center
where Marcellus is little more than a blur of mayhem

ARCHIMEDES
Marcellus

Marcellus turns confused The Syracusan Captain takes
the opportunity to attack

MARCELLUS
Archimedes

Archimedes launches himself in front of his Captain

ARCHIMEDES
No

SYRACUSIAN CAPTAIN
What are you doing

ARCHIMEDES
Hold I say
A Roman raises his sword to kill Archimedes

MARCELLUS
(blocks him)
Stand down

The center of the battle has suddenly become the calm eye
of the storm Soldiers on both sides do not know what to
do Their commanding officers areholding

ARCHIMEDES
Theyve got Amelia

Marcellus stares at him Makes his decision

MARCELLUS
Lead on

The two men turn and rush toward the castle

Soldiers they leave hover unsure Are they still at war

INT SYRACUSE CASTLE - THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

CARTHAGINIAN SOLDIERS carry treasures away down the
TUNNEL Hippocrates ties a BAG OF SCROLLS onto his hip

EPICYDES
Is that secure enough

AMELIA PULLS FREE of Epycides and makes a run for it

HIPPOCRATES
Better than yours
(grabs her)
We have no more need of her

anyway

He unsheathes his sword to kill her when suddenly a
KNIFE sings out of the air and through his sleeve -
pinning his arm to the wall

EPYCIDES
The Roman

They turn to see Marcellus and Archimedes at the door
Ready to do some serious murder

MARCELLUS
Drop her Or lose your head

HIPPOCRATES
Speak honestly Marcellus like a
good soldier You’re here for my
head regardless
ARCHIMEDES
Well if you hurt her he’1ll just
make it that much more painful
I’m pretty sure

MARCELLUS
True

EPYCIDES
No more talk

Epycides charges Archimedes Hippocrates pulls free of
the knife in the wall Draws his sword

Marcellus defends Archimedes drives Epycides to the
door He puts his back to Archimedes’ back

MARCELLUS
(sotto to Archimedes)
We stay together

A CARTHAGINIAN SOLDIER rushes out from the tunnel

CARTHAGINIAN SOLDIER
Captain

HIPPOCRATES
Get the others back here you
idiot Now

The Carthaginian ducks back down to grab the other thugs

Marcellus advances crossing swords with Hippocrates in
front Epycides slashes at Archimedes but Archimedes
defends and retreats - keeping his back to Marcellus’

Amelia sneakily grabs Marcellus’ knife out of the wall
and CUTS OFF HER BINDINGS

AMELIA
Marcellus A sword

Hippocrates turns surprised Marcellus pulls a second
SWORD tosses it to her She points it at Hippocrates

ARCHIMEDES
Three against two

HIPPOCRATES
Two against two really

ARCHIMEDES
I could get lucky

HIPPOCRATES
(smiles)
I may not be as clever as you
But I will be bringing the best of
you back with me

Hippocrates shows off his bag It is full of SCROLLS

ARCHIMEDES
My designs

With a loud stomping SIX Carthaginians return up the
tunnel and draw SWORDS The heroes are sandwiched

HIPPOCRATES
Your creations will win Hannibal
Rome and after that the world
(to his men)
Kindly show him our thanks

The Carthaginian Soldiers ATTACK Amelia Archimedes and
Marcellus defend themselves Hippocrates and Epycides RUN
AWAY in the confusion - OUT THE DOOR

ARCHIMEDES
Theyre running

AMELIA
Then go after them

ARCHIMEDES
What

She SKEWERS a Carthaginian and CUTS the Achilles tendon
of a second one Archimedes clumsily defends himself

AMELIA

I will handle these men myself
ARCHIMEDES

But-—
MARCELLUS

(spears one)
Shes right If Hannibal adds your
weapons to his army the world is
doomed Let her finish this We
will catch the brothers

He yanks his sword from his victim and runs for the door
Archimedes takes a last look at Amelia and then follows

Amelia squares off against the remaining three
AMELIA
(smiles)

I really needed this

They attack In a few angry moves she kills them all
INT SYRACUSE CASTLE - HALLWAYS - SAME
Marcellus spies Hippocrates disappearing up a staircase

MARCELLUS
Archimedes the ramparts

ARCHIMEDES
They’1l escape over the wall

MARCELLUS
Not if you manage to run just a
little faster

ARCHIMEDES
I’m a mathematician

Marcellus races off Archimedes pauses to gulp air

EXT SYRACUSE - RAMPARTS - MOMENTS LATER

Marcellus jumps the last stairs onto the ramparts He
sees NOTHING Sensing an attack he ducks moments before
Hippocrates’ sword slices where his neck had been

Marcellus turns to see Hippocrates and Epycides
THEY ATTACK TOGETHER Clearly a challenge for Marcellus

ARCHIMEDES
Marcellus

Archimedes pulls himself up the last few steps and leaps
into the fray He and Epycides clash swords Archimedes
is the poorer swordsman Epycides pushes him back --

MARCELLUS
(to Archimedes)
Don’t give ground

ARCHIMEDES
Have you seen the size of mine
Care to trade

Epycides pushes Archimedes against the edge of the
rampart He peeks over the side Through the CATAPULTS
the ground is HUNDREDS OF FEET below Archimedes pales

EPYCIDES
No jokes

ARCHIMEDES
No need

He feints slices at Epycides Epycides dodges slow and
his arm gets CUT Archimedes smiles Enraged Epycides
rushes him raises him up and THROWS HIM OVER THE SIDE

MARCELLUS
NO

Archimedes is gone Epycides joins his brother Marcellus
uses all his skill to fight BOTH Helpfully Epycides is
wounded Marcellus gains the advantage disarms Epycides

MARCELLUS (CONTD)
For Archimedes

He thrusts his sword through Epycides’ ribs Epycides’
eyes widen in surprise He crumples to the floor

HIPPOCRATES
Epycides
(to Marcellus)
What have you done What have you
done

Hippocrates attacks Marcellus in a furious rage
HAMMERING him Disarms Marcellus Raises his sword high

HIPPOCRATES (CONTD)
For Hannibal And my brother

Marcellus knows he’s beat But suddenly he sees MOVEMENT
BEHIND HIPPOCRATES A WOODEN ARM SWINGING AROUND

Hippocrates turns to see what Marcellus is gaping at The
ARM of a fulcrum-catapult SWIVELS through the air At the
far end ARCHIMEDES is revealed He GUIDES the arm around

Thinking fast - Marcellus GRABS THE BAG FROM HIPPOCRATES’
HIP

The CLAW SWOOPS DOWN - SKEWERS HIPPOCRATES

Like a slingshot the Claw LOFTS HIPPOCRATES over the
courtyard of Syracuse Screaming

Soldiers on the ground look up Hippocrates squeals as he
flies over Syracuse and slams into the gate Dead

His body is immediately looted

ON TOP OF THE RAMPARTS

Archimedes limps over to Marcellus and helps him up
Together they walk to the edge of the ramparts and look
down at the men Marcellus lifts his arms in victory

The ROMANS raise their swords and cheer The SYRACUSANS
hang their heads and drop their weapons
ELSEWHERE IN A COURTYARD

ROMAN SOLDIERS run through the streets taking anything
of worth Several of them TEAR THE TILES off of the
SEASHELL FRESCO that Archimedes had shown to Amelia
Destroying the fresco completely

BACK ON THE RAMPARTS

Archimedes registers the chaos His smile quickly fades

MARCELLUS
We have won
ARCHIMEDES
(bitterly)

And what is your first command

MARCELLUS
Come now Archimedes Rome
desires your happiness as much as
I do You will be given a hero’s
welcome

Archimedes looks below Romans are grabbing pouches and
belongings from Syracusans

ARCHIMEDES
I am your spoil of war

MARCELLUS
You are a celebrity Isn’t that
what you wanted And with your
machines no army will dare defy
us We can unite the known world

ARCHIMEDES
(corrects him)
Defeat
MARCELLUS

We will bring peace And with
these you will become the most
important man on the planet

He hands over Archimedes’ scrolls that Hippocrates stole
MARCELLUS (CONTD)
Pack I will send an escort We

will feast in Rome

Marcellus claps him on the back and runs down the stairs
INT ARCHIMEDES’ WORKSHOP - LATER

Archimedes enters his haven He pauses surrounded by
models of his designs for war

He takes out the scrolls from the bag Hippocrates had
tried to purloin Schematics of his mirrors the hooks
the Claws of Archimedes He fondly runs his hand over it
The work of genius His pathway to fame and greatness

HE THROWS HIS DESIGNS ON THE FIRE All of them Ina
sudden outburst of emotion he grabs all of his models
everything in sight and throws them in the fire too

He pauses when he comes across his design for THE
ARCHIMEDEAN SCREW An invention to help not harm

AMELIA (0S)
Somehow I doubt Marcellus would
approve

Archimedes whirls around He had been so consumed he had
not heard her enter He realizes she saw what he’s done

ARCHIMEDES
I can’t do it I will not be a war
puppet I will not go to Rome

He waits Will she turn him in Surprisingly she smiles

AMELIA
I am glad to hear it

ARCHIMEDES
(relieved)
Come with me

AMELIA
The senators who lied for
Hippocrates will be banished I am
all that’s left and needed for
the transition to protect our
people

ARCHIMEDES
I need you I love you

AMELIA
(wavers )
If only you could have said that
in Egypt We had choices then But
now it is too late

ARCHIMEDES
I didn’t know what I had Now I
know Give me one more chance
AMELIA
Our chances have been superseded
with fate You cannot stay And I
cannot leave
(beat)
But I will not tell Marcellus that
you have gone

ARCHIMEDES
Thank you

Awkwardly he packs THE DESIGN OF THE SCREW into a bag

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
Goodbye

AMELIA
Fare well

This is it Their final moments He suddenly grabs her up
in his arms They kiss passionately

He releases her Hesitates -- grabs a few SACKS OF WINE

ARCHIMEDES
For the journey Of course

She lets out a small laugh He smiles sadly Leaves
Amelia holds herself and wipes a tear from her cheek
EXT ARCHIMEDES APARTMENT - SAME

The OLD MAN holding the reins of the Donkey for Damippus
is suddenly surprised by TWO ROMAN SOLDIERS

ROMAN SOLDIER 1
What have we here

OLD MAN
Leave me be This is how I get my
gold

ROMAN SOLDIER 1
Gold

ROMAN SOLDIER 2
Anything precious must be turned
over to Rome grandfather didn’t
you hear We won

OLD MAN
Leave off

He shoves Roman Soldier 1 who trips and falls in a pile
of MANURE Roman Soldier 2 laughs
ROMAN SOLDIER 1
(drawing his sword)
You think that funny
He SKEWERS the Old Man Damippus arrives witnesses this

DAMIPPUS
No

He attacks the Romans but they push him back laughing

ROMAN SOLDIER 1
This one’s got a little muscle

ROMAN SOLDIER 2
Help me grab his arms A young
buck will fetch a fine price

ARCHIMEDES
Unhand him

Archimedes approaches furious Sets down his BAG
ROMAN SOLDIER 2

Whatever you’ve got in your sack
there belongs to Rome

ROMAN SOLDIER 1
Refuse and die Syracusan

Damippus stomps on his captor’s shin WRIGGLES FREE

DAMIPPUS
Sir get behind me

ARCHIMEDES
(draws his sword)
Damippus In my satchel you will
find a design Take it to Amelia
Archimedes attacks Surprised the Romans defend

DAMIPPUS
But sir--

ARCHIMEDES
Go

Damippus grabs ARCHIMEDES’ SCROLLS from the bag Runs

Roman Soldier 1 regains his confidence Slices at
Archimedes Archimedes ducks the first the second

But not the third
The Soldier’s sword CUTS ACROSS ARCHIMEDES’ CHEST

RED POURS OUT STAINING HIS SHIRT POOLS AT HIS FEET
ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
That wasunexpected

He appears to get an IDEA But then crumples to the
ground lifelessly

ROMAN SOLDIER 2
Grab the goods and get on with it
We’re missing all the fun

They take the DONKEY Leaving two bodies behind

EXT SYRACUSE CASTLE - PALACE STEPS - LATER

Amelia approaches Marcellus He is gazing down at
SOLDIERS ransacking Syracuse

AMELIA
(cooly)
And what will you do with
Syracuse General now that you
have her

MARCELLUS
In accordance with the rules of
war Soldiers of Rome will
pillage And keep what they find

AMELIA
We are yours to ravage

MARCELLUS
There is no other way

AMELIA
Because you make no other way

He does not answer Conflicted Suddenly his Captain
runs up distressed Damippus follows

ROMAN CAPTAIN
General I have bad tidings--

MARCELLUS
Not now Captain--

ROMAN CAPTAIN
Archimedes is dead sir

AMELIA
Dead

ROMAN CAPTAIN
Apparently he resisted Roman
Soldiers when they tried to take
his scrolls This servant came to
me for help
I detained him to check his story
but when I arrived I found
Archimedes dead

DAMIPPUS offers Amelia the scroll

DAMIPPUS
He wanted you to have this It was
his final wish

She opens the scroll Sees Archimedes’ Screw

AMELIA
(begins to cry)
Nono

Marcellus’ eyes go dark This is all his fault

MARCELLUS
Gather the men All of them

EXT COURTYARD IN FRONT OF THE PALACE - LATER

The Romans stand at attention facing Marcellus who
stands at the top of the Palace stairs Syracusans watch

A DEAD BODY COVERED IN A WHITE SHEET is carried
ceremoniously through the crowd and up the stairs

Amelia stands behind Marcellus Tears stain her face

MARCELLUS
Courageous soldiers of Rome For
your bravery Rome offers any
treasure of Syracuse you find
(beat)

But I will not allow it You will
not take her riches You will not
take her art And you will not
take her people

ROMANS SOLDIERS
Deny us our feeHe cannotetc

MARCELLUS

SILENCE

(they stop shocked)
The greatest treasure of Syracuse
a man that can never be matched
nor replaced has been killed His
name was Archimedes and with him
Rome would have achieved her true
potential But that man is dead

(wavers )
His light has left our universe
But his memory stays in our
hearts
Nothing more will be destroyed
for we have taken too much
already Any man who steals from
Syracuse will be put to death Do
any here wish to defy my decree

The Soldiers stand silent awestruck by his emotion

AMELIA
Then let us all spend a moment
together remembering Archimedes A
man we were privileged to live
alongside however brief that was

The whole of Syracuse and the Roman army bow their heads
in tribute Men of faith raise their voices in sorrow
The CHANT is taken up by all those in attendance

Amelia sees TEARS roll down Marcellus’ cheeks She puts
her hand in his Despite the crowd they are alone

Their fingers interlace Grip tight

The pall-bearing soldiers present the COVERED BODY to
Marcellus He raises the sheet to look at Archimedes’
face - and SEES INSTEAD THE DEAD OLD MAN

He and Amelia look to the Roman Captain Shocked

ROMAN CAPTAIN
(sorrowfully)
Exactly as Cicero described him

MARCELLUS
Cicero But --

Amelia touches his arm secretly silencing him

AMELIA
Captain we would like to see
where exactly he was killed

WALKING ALONG THE SYRACUSAN STREETS
The Roman Captain leads Marcellus and Amelia

AMELIA
(whispers)
Cicero That was the biographer
Archimedes tricked in Alexandria

MARCELLUS
Every Roman reads Cicero’s work

AMELIA
-And thinks Archimedes is an old
man
They look at each other with mounting hope

EXT ARCHIMEDES APARTMENTS - MOMENTS LATER

The Captain leads them to the road near Archimedes’ home
TWO RED STAINS soak the street

ROMAN CAPTAIN
It was here my lady

AMELIA
Why are there two pools of blood

ROMAN CAPTAIN
The second is from an assistant
According to the soldiers he put
up a fight for his master’s books

He takes his leave Amelia goes pale turns to Marcellus
AMELIA
Only Archimedes would have been
foolish enough to fight for his
MARCELLUS
There is far too much blood here

for him to have survived

AMELIA
Wait Do you smell that

He sniffs Kneels Touches the stain Smells his fingers

MARCELLUS
(smiles)
Wine

Amelia giddily smiles Then realizes the repercussions

AMELIA
If Rome finds out they will
pursue him To the ends of the
Earth

MARCELLUS
(beat)
I have already made my decree
Amelia No man shall be taken from
Syracuse against his will

She smiles wide wraps herself in his arms He holds her
He notices a TRAIL OF WINEleading toward the castle
DEEP IN A TUNNEL UNDER SYRACUSE

A CLOAKED MAN moves quickly through the underground
passage He stops His hood falls back Archimedes Pulls
a slashed dripping WINE SKIN BAG from under his tunic

ARCHIMEDES
Not how I planned to use you but
you were useful nonetheless

Tosses it Yanks another from his sack Takes a pull

ARCHIMEDES (CONTD)
Let’s see where this goes then
shall we

Packs it Moves on to the light at the end of the tunnel

FADE TO WHITE

THE FOLLOWING WORDS APPEAR OVER BLACK IN THESE GROUPS

Because of General Marcus Marcellus decree in 212 BC
the first of its kind the art and works of Syracuse were
preserved These are credited with inspiring the golden
age of Rome They can be seen today in a museum in Italy

In 48 BC the Library of Alexandria burned down in a war
between Julius Caesar and Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII Surviving
artifacts were relocated to the Library of Iraq which
was looted and burned down in 2003 AD

Much of Archimedes’ works have been lost to time and the
destruction of war What documents remain accelerated
human understanding of math and physics

Archimedes’ incredible war machines were documented by
soldiers on both sides

Rumors of his death however have never been confirmed
