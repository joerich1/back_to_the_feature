INT KITTREDGES APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAWN

JOHN FLANDERS KITTREDGE and LOUISA KITTREDGE (FLAN and
OUISA) an attractive couple in their 40s in their night
clothes are in an uncharacteristic state of shock

Some sort of horrible disaster has happened to them

THEY survey their living room which under normal
circumstances would appear to be a serene haven

But why are they-so aghast And terrified

Has the apartment been violated

The Fifth Avenue apartment red and cozy threadbare with
the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out is
filled with beautiful objects chosen with care Even though
the apartment is 19th Century in feel a lot of modern
paintings hang on the walls

No No visible disaster here

But then why FLAN and OUISAs emotional state THEY run
between the hall and the living room

OUISA
Is anything gone
OUISA opens the front closet with trepidation But nothing
leaps out SHE sees a mink is still there

FLAW
How can I look Im shaking

OUISA
My god The Kandinsky
OQUISA runs into the living room SHE can see by the
discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing

OUISA Y
Its gone Call the police

FLAN
There it is
An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a
Philadelphia Chippendale chair the painting is wild and
brilliantly colored

OUISA
Thank god
SHE picks the painting up and flips it around Its a double
sided painting The artist Kandinsky had painted in
different styles on either side of the canvas

One side of the painting is geometric and somber the other
side is all chaos and brilliant colors
OUISA replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it
belongs but the side she chooses to display is the
geometric side SHE admires it
FLAN opens the door from the hall into

THE OFFICE

A computer Calendars File cabinets Bulletin boards with
prints of paintings tacked on FLAN checks - the slide
projector is there FLAN opens and closes cabinet drawers
OUISA appears in the doorway of the office

OUISA
We couldve been killed

FLAN
Dont say that The silver Victorian inkwell
FLAN runs past OUISA down the hall back to the living room
OUISA follows HIM back into

THE LIVING ROOM

FLAN looks on an antique table crowded with framed family
photographs going way back in time and all kinds of
mementoes

OUISA
How can you think of things We could have been
murdered

FLAN
I want to know if anythings gone
HE picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver
beaver and looks at it with great objectivity
FLAN
Theres the inkwell Silver beaver Why
OUISA drained looks out the window down onto Central Park

OUISA
Slashed ---our throats slashed
Go to bed at night happy and then murdered
Would we have-woken up
OQUISA screams

But its their pug dog licking her leg
OUISA picks up the dog and pets it
FLAN remembers something and buries his face in his hands

FLAN
We have to go to the wedding

OUISA
I am in no mood to go to any wedding

FLAN
We have to

OUISA
Theyre your friends

FLAN
I beg to differ Theyre Your fr -
FLAN stops frightened suddenly listening

FLAN
Hello
OUISA runs to HIM terrified HE holds HER

OUISA (WHISPERS)
You dont call out Hello unless--
THEY walk softly to the dark hall

FLAN
I think we could tell if someone else was here
OUISA
We didnt all night
THEY look down the silent dark hall

INT THE WHITE WALL SOMEWHERE ELSE

We dont know where we are yet but its certainly not the
KITTREDGES The rain drumming outside and the distant
thunder and the soft cool jazz playing makes the air of this
room with the white wall wherever it is claustrophobic
even erotic

A YOUNG BLACK MAN whose name is PAUL comes into frame and
leans against this white wall Right off you say this

YOUNG MAN is a winner

PAUL frowns then smiles Right into the camera

PAUL

(SERIOUS)
Hello

(FLIRTATIOUS)
Hello

(QUESTIONING)
Hello

(SUSPICIOUS)
Hello

(ELATED)
Hello
Yes
Hello
SOMEONE OFF SCREEN claps
PAUL bows to the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE

EXT KITTREDGES APARTMENT BUILDING 910 FIFTH AVENUE DAY
OUISA and FLAN run out of their apartment building their
clothes hastily pulled on their faces swollen with shock
THEY run down the side street into

THE GARAGE
Their car is waiting - a Mercedes - FLAN slips the
attendant a bill FLAN gets in the drivers seat
OUISA gets in the passenger seat
FLAN (a statement of fact)
Im shaking

OUISA
Then Ill drive

FLAN
I have to hang on

T

OUISA
Lets just get there

INT THE WHITE WALL
The Sound of the rain the jazz the thunder

PAUL
Bottle of beer
Bottle of beer
Bottle of beer
AN UNSEEN YOUNG MAN OFF CAMERA speaks - elegant phrasing

VOICE
Bottle of beer

PAUL
Bottle- of beer

VOICE
Very good You owe me
PAUL takes off his shirt HEs strongly built HE throws

the shirt directly into the camera
EXT HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY DAY
FLAN is driving terrifically fast OUISA puts on a tape

MARIA CALLAS sings the death scene from La Traviata

OUISA
Be care -
A CAR veers by FLAN swerves his car

OUISA
Let me drive

FLAN (FURIOUS)
Driving calms me

OUISA
When youre in one of these moods you do not
drive well and I do not want to be killed today

FLAN
We could have been killed last night

OUISA
Stop saying that

FLAN pulls himself together HE moves over to the Slow lane

FLAN
Im driving slowly See Slowly

OUISA
I went in the room first
FLAN looks for signs

FLAN
Wheres the goddam turnoff onto the Taconic
A truck veers and almost hits them

OUISA
You didnt see what I saw
FLAN puts on brakes

FLAN
Its that fucking Maria Callas
Turn that damn thing off

FLAN snaps off the tape deck
THEY resume driving

OUISA
Its not Maria Callas Its that truck and you

FLAN
And last night
THE COUNTRYSIDE speeds by

EXT ST PETERS EPISCOPAL CHURCH LITHGOW NEW YORK DAY
LOTS OF CARS parked in front of this sweet rural wooden
chapel near Millbrook New York

THE BRIDE 20s gets out of a limo escorted by her FATHER
OUISA and FLAN run up to the BRIDE and kiss her

OUISA
Happy is the bride the sun shines on

BRIDE (ALARMED)

OUISA (BRIGHT)

FLAN
Wonderful wedding Wonderful day
THEY run into

THE CHAPEL

Thisperfect country chapel with a dozen or so rows of pews
is bedecked with flowers and lit by candles

A STRING QUARTET at the side of the little altar plays
Dvoraks American Quartet

THE USHER in morning clothes greets FLAN and OUISA and
shows them to their pew

USHER
Brides side Grooms side

FLAN
Either side I cant even remember
how we met them Why are we here
THEY walk down the aisle heads down
OUISA
Do not make a scene
THEY kneel

FLAN (WHISPER)
Now I lay me down to sleep - the most
terrifying words just think of it -

OUISA (WHISPER)
I pray the Lord my soul to keep-

FLAN (WHISPER)
The nightmare part - If I should
die before I wake -

OUISA (WHISPER)
If I should die - I pray the Lord
my soul to take -
COUPLE IN THE PEW IN FRONT turn A
MAN A WOMAN strangely not unlike FLAN and OUISA perhaps A
few years older perhaps more nautical as if theyd flown a
in from Nantucket are named SANDY and CONNIE

SANDY
Is anything wrong

OUISA
We were almost murdered

FLAN

THROATS SLASHED
THE PEOPLE in the pew in front gasp
FLAN and OUISA are serious
THE QUARTET plays The Wedding March
EVERYONE stands
THE BRIDE and her FATHER walk down the aisle
CU OUISAS FACE lost in thought
Bright vivid colors fill the screen Later we will learn
they are from a double-sided painting by Kandinsky which

HANGS IN

THE KITTREDGES LIVING ROOM
OUISA (VO)

Chaos

OUISAS face appears briefly smiling then is replaced by
dark geometric patterns The other side of the painting
It is lowered to reveal OUISA very serious

OUISA (VO)
Control
(The painting is flipped)
Chaos
(OUISA smiles Flips it again Frowns)
Control

BACK IN THE CHAPEL

OUISA still frowning at her memory realizes the wedding
ceremony is over

THE BRIDE and the GROOM run up the aisle beaming at EVERYONE
to the strains of Lohengrin

But even THEY slow down when THEY see the state FLAN and
OUISA are in

GROOM
Is everything all
FLAN snaps out of it putting on his party smile

FLAN
We always get this way at weddings
THE BRIDE and GROOM resume their run up the aisle
ts FLAN and OUISAs turn to leave the pew and go up the
aisle SHE is stricken

OUISA
do not always get this way at weddings

FLAN

Were alive

THEY walk up the aisle into the foyer of the chapel
SHE puts her head into his shoulder

OUISA
Oh it was awful awful awful awful
Then OUISA and FLAN put on their best smiles as THEY pass
through a receiving line finally shaking hands with the

WEDDING COUPLE

BRIDE

Did you say you could have been killed

OUISA (MERRY)
Yes Only hours ago

FLAN (MERRY)
But were here

OUISA
Wouldnt miss it
THE BRIDE and GROOM look after THEM

EXT THE MILLBROOK GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB DAY

A spankingly bright and solid country club in Millbrook New
York situated on the golf course grounds surrounded by lots
of tennis courts

INT MILLBROOK CLUB DAY

THE WEDDING GUESTS file into the cheery club all bright
white and a shade of cheery green that only country clubs
seem to find

MORE GUESTS than could f it into the CHAPEL are here in the
club waiting for the Bride and Groom

FLAN and OUISA hesitate before going into the ballroom

THEY stop in the small quiet dark clubby BAR
THEY sit at a small table pulling themselves together
SANDY and CONNIE (the people from the pew in front of them)
come up to THEM A WOMAN who looks like a dormouse is with
them SHE is named JULIA

SANDY
We hate to pry -
FLAN
No no Youre not prying

CONNIE
But what happened -

SANDY
This is our friend Julia

FLAN
Do we know each other

JULIA
Oh yes through

9 FLAN
Of course Havent seen them in years
FLAN shakes hands with the new acquaintance

CONNIE
Were worried for you
FLAN and OUISA look at each other

OUISA
Tell them
SANDY and CONNIE and JULIA sit down at the small table

FLAN
We were having a wonderful evening last night

OUISA
A friend we hadnt seen for many years came by
for dinner I dont think you know him -

FLAN (PORTENTOUSLY)
Geoffrey Miller From South Africa--

OUISA
Dont say it so portentously

FLAN (BRIGHT)
Geoffrey from South Africa

OUISA
Dont be ga-ga
(THEY give their orders to THE BARTENDER )
Something large

SANDY
didnt know Geoffrey was in town

JULIA
saw him at Susie Baxters

SANDY
wasnt at Susie Baxters

CONNIE
Sandy forgets he was married to Susie Baxter
THE WAITER goes

SAVOY
Thats no reason why she cant
invite me to a party
CONNIE whispers to JULIA her eyes on FLAN

fq

CONNIE
Hes an art dealer
JULIA nods now thats shes remembered
FLAN (hears it)
Private sales Purchases
OUISA leans forward Somehow the telling calms HER
THE CHUMS lean forward

OUISA
We knew Geoffrey

FLAN
through our children when Geoffrey and his
family all lived in New York

OUISA
Theyve moved back to South Africa

FLAN
He was here in New York briefly on business
and asked us to ask him for dinner

OUISA
Hes King Midas rich Literally Gold mines
THE WAITER puts down the tray of drinks

FLAN
Seventy thousand workers in just one gold mine

OUISA
But he is always short of cash because his
government wont let its people --

FLAN
Its white people --

OUISA
-- its white people take out any money So its
like taking in a War Baby

(TO WAITER)
Thank you That ones mine -
THEY switch drinks

FLAN
When he called it was like a bolt from the blue
as I had a deal coming up and was short by

OUISA

TWO MILLION
FLAN puts down his drink

FLAN
The figure is superfluous
OUISA turns to CONNIE

OUISA
I hate when he uses the word superfluous I
mean we needed two million and we hadnt seen
Geoffrey in a long time and while Geoffrey might
not have the price of a dinner he easily might
have two million dollars

FLAN
The currents last night were very churny
CUISA
we werent sucking up We like Geoffrey

FLAN
Its that awful thing of having truly
rich folk for friends

OUISA
Face it The money does get in the -

FLAN
Only if you let it The fact of the money
shouldnt get in-

OUISA
Having a rich friend is like drowning and your
friend makes life boats But the friend gets
very touchy if you say one word life boat
(THE CHUMS laugh)
Well thats two words We were afraid our
South African friend might say You only love me
for my life boats But we like Geoffrey

CONNIE
I know who he is now

JULIA
Lovely man

x

SANDY
Didnt he invite us to visit him

FLAN
It wasnt a life-threatening evening

OUISA -
Rich people can do something for you even if
youre not sure what it isyou want them to do
THEY turn at the sound of applause
THE BRIDE and GROOM have entered the Country Club and our
table in the bar looks up as THE WEDDING PARTY passes by for
a moment rushing past the Bar into the ballroom

off in the ballroom THE SMALL ORCHESTRA strikes up Just One
Of Those Things for the ten thousandth time

EVERYONE in the club is applauding and OUR TABLE applauds
too OUISA starts to rise

OUISA
Should we

CONNIE
Not on your life
CONNIE pulls OUISA back down to the table

FLAN signals another round

FLAN
Hardly a Life Boat evening -
OUISA sits enjoying this

OUISA (SING-SONG)
Portentous

FLAN
But when Geoffrey called and asked us to take
him for dinner he made a sudden pattern in
lifes little tea leaves because who wants to
go to banks
FLANS VOICE takes us back to last night

INT THE KITTREDGES LIVING ROOM NIGHT

FLAN (VO)
Geoffrey called and our tempests settled
into showers and life was manageable What
more can you want

GEOFFREY stands up into the frame an elegant impeccably
British South African more English than the English ten
years older than Ouisa and Flan
FLAN and OUISA are both dressed very stylishly and nattily
tonight But not trendy not so it shows

FLAN was definitely an athlete and he still keeps himself in
trim If HEs in the art world theres nothing arty about
him

GEOFFREY
Listen
OUISA stops doing what shes doing which is rolling out a
drink trolley with little hors doeuvres on plates
FLAN stops doing what hes doing which is checking that a
slide projector is in place on the desk along side the
silver beaver inkwell
FLAN and OUISA both tense

FLAN
Whats wrong

GEOFFREY
It always amazes me when New York is so quiet
OUISA and FLAN relax and laugh

OUISA
With the kids away we get used to a lower noise
quotient
FLAN pours a drink for GEOFFREY

FLAN
Geoffrey you have to move out of
South Africa Youll be killed
Why do you stay in South Africa

GEOFFREY
One has to stay there to educate the black
workers and well know weve been successful
when they kill us

FLAN
Planning the revolution that will destroy you

OUISA sits back on the comfy sofa amazed at the thought
OUISA
Putting your life on the line

GEOFFREY
You dont think of it like that
I wish youd come visit
OUISA takes her drink and strokes the ears of her dog

OUISA
But wed visit you and sit in your gorgeous
house planning trips into the townships
demanding to see the poorest of the poor Are
you sure theyre the worst off I mean weve
come all this way We dont want to see people
just mildly victimized by apartheid We demand
shock It doesnt seem right sitting on the
East Side talking about revolution

FLAN
Only small murky cafes for Pepe le Noko here

OUISA
No La Passionaria I will come to
South Africa and build barricades and
lean against them singing

FLAN
And the people would follow

OUISA
Follow Follow Follow Whats that song

FLAN

The way Gorbachev cheered on the striking coal
miners in the Ukraine - yes you must strike-
it is your role in history to dismantle this
system Russia and Poland - you cant believe
the developments in the world -

(HE remembers) The Fantasticks (SINGS)
Follow Follow Follow
OUISA
China
FLAN and OUISA (despair)
Oh

GEOFFREY
Oy vay China As my grandmother would say
Our role in history And we offer ourselves up

to it

FLAN
That is your role in history Not our role
OUISA ponders this thought

OUISA
A role in history To say that so easily
GEOFFREY suddenly gets up and looks through the telescope by
the window

GEOFFREYS POV
GEOFFREY flashes down nine floors into Central Park HE
frowns in puzzlement when HE sees

A STATUE OF AN ALASKAN HUSKY

baying up into the sky

FLAN and OUISA look at GEOFFREYs back and then at each
other How to keep the ball rolling

FLAN (to Geoffrey)

Do you want another drink before we--

GEOFFREY turns into the room

GEOFFREY
Wonderful view
OUISA
The phrase - striking coal miners - I see all

these very striking coal miners modelling the
fall fashions
GEOFFREY
Where should we

FLAN
Theres good Szechuan And Hunan

OUISA
The sign painter screwed up the sign Instead
of The Hunan Wok he painted The Human Wok

GEOFFREY
God The restaurants New York has become the
Florence of the Sixteenth Century Genius on
every corner

OUISA
I dont think genius has kissed the Human Wok
THEY finish off their drinks

GEOFFREY
The new Italian looked cheery
FLAN and OUISA
Good

FLAN
We made reservations
FLAN looks at the slide projector

FLAN
Geoffrey Id like to show -
FLANS sentence hangs in mid-air as GEOFFREY follows OUISA

INTO
THE HALL
OUISA burrows in the closet getting her coat and

GEOFFREYS coat out of the hall closet stuffed with tennis
rackets and skis and boots

OUISA
This restaurant - they wrap ravioli up
like salt water taffy
FLAN appears behind HER to help HER
THEY both wrestle the coats out of the closet

FLAN
Six on a plate for a few hundred dollars
And FLAN gets the coats A clatter of tennis rackets
falling GEOFFREY takes his topcoat

GEOFFREY
You have to come to South Africa so
I can pay you back Ill take you on my plane
into the Okavango Swamps -

OUISA
Did you hear - to take back to Johannesburg
out in Eastharpton

FLAN
LAST WEEKEND

OUISA
a guy goes into one of the better food stores -

FLAN
Dean and DeLuca -
FLAN helps OUISA on with her coat

OUISA
one of the Dean and DeLuca look alikes Gets a
pack of cigarettes and an ice cream bar Goes
up front Sees theres a line at the register
Slaps down two twenty dollar bills and goes out
GEOFFREY doesnt get the anecdote

FLAN
We sent it to the Times
GEOFFREY smiles politely
FLAN and OUISA press a little bit too hard

OUISA
They have the joke page of things

around New York

Iv

FLAN
They send you a bottle of champagne
THEY all laugh brightly

INT MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
THE CHUMS listen enrapt OUISA is serious

OUISA
We werent auditioning but I kept thinking Two
Million dollars Two Million dollars

FLAN
Its like when people say -Dont think about
elephants and all you can think about is
elephants elephants elephants

OUISA
Two million dollars Two million dollars

BACK IN THE KITTREDGES LIVING ROOM

OUISA and FLAN laugh brightly THE FRONT DOORBELL rings
OUISA and FLAN look at each other Who is that

OUISA goes into the hall

OUISA
What ever you do dont think about elephants

GEOFFREY
Elephants
FLAN rapidly steers GEOFFREY to a chair closes the living
room door then wheels a projector with a carousel tray into
place

FLAN
Louisa is a dada manifesto About the Cezanne -
unless were careful itll be sold and never
seen again -
FLAN switches off the rooms lights and clicks on the
projector The slide projection of a beautiful green
landscape by Cezanne fills the wall by the door

FLAN
Mid-period Landscape of a dark green forest
In the far distance you see the sunlight One
of his first uses of a pale color being forced
to carry the weight of the picture The
experiment that would pay of f in the apples A
burst of color asked to carry so much-- The
Japanese dont like anything about it except
its a Cezanne--
And suddenly the door in the wall opens up
A YOUNG BLACK MAN supported by the ELEVATOR MAN (EDDIE)
appears in the Cezanne forest holding his eyes against the
rojectors light And OUISA behind HIM
LAN clicks off the projector
UISA switches on the living room lights
HE YOUNG BLACK MAN - PAUL - is in his early twenties very
andsome very preppy His shirt front is ripped and
loodied Fresh blood EDDIE helps PAUL to the sofa

BACK IN THE KITTREDGES LIVING ROOM
PAUL (exhausted and scared)
I was mugged Out there In Central Park By

the statue of that Alaskan husky I was

standing there trying to figure out why there is
a statue of a dog who saved lives in the Yukon
in Central Park and I was standing there trying
to puzzle it out when -

OUISA

FLAN helps PAUL out of the room down the hall

OUISA

EDDIE goes

FLAN followed by OUISA supports PAUL into

THE WHITE TILED BATHROOM

PAUL sits on the side of the tub

PAUL takes off his blazer and pulls off his ripped shirt

His tie is still around his neck There is a good sized
knife slash in his side by his rib cage OUISA and FLAN

cringe FLAN opens the medicine cabinet

PAUL
I dont mind the money But in this age of
mechanical reproduction they managed to get the
only copy of my thesis

FLAN
Wheres the first aid book
OUISA runs into their bedroom
PAUL looks out the bathroom door into FLAN and OUISAS

THE MASTER BEDROOM

OUISA rummages through her book case and finds her Red
Cross manual OUISA turns and sees PAUL sitting on the edge
of the tub staring at HER

FLAN is crouched down bathing PAULS slash

OUISA mutters under her breath as she dashes down

THE HALL

OUISA

FLAN beams

MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

OUISA
And peace was restored

BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM
FLAN holds out PAULs blazer PAUL winces as HE lifts his
arms to put it on

PAUL
Your children said you were kind All the kids
were sitting around the dorm one night dishing
the- shit out of their parents But your kids
were silent and said No not our parents Not
Flan and Ouisa Not the Kittredges The
Kittredges are kind So after the muggers left
I looked up and saw these Fifth Avenue
apartments Mrs Onassis lives there I know
the Babcocks live over there The Auchinclosses
live there But you lived here I came here
OUISA so touched turns to FLAN and GEOFFREY

OUISA
Can you believe what the kids said
PAUL looks at the framed photos on wall of
0 THE HALL

PAUL
But your kids - I love them Talbot and Woody
mean the world to me

FLAN
He lets you call him Woody Nobodys

THEY come into

THE LIVING ROOM
PAUL looks around happily HE goes to the wall by the
mantlepiece and looks at a dark abstract painting

PAUL
They described this apartment in detail This
is a Kandinsky - a double One painted on
either side May I see -

OUISA lifts the painting off the wall and turns it around
Even GEOFFREY is taken by the painting

0 26

FLAN
What makes it valuable is Kandinsky painted on
either side of the canvas in two wildly
different styles One side is geometric and
somrr The other side is wild and vivid

GEOFFREY
My god

FLAN
We flip it around for variety
OUISA happily turns the painting back and forth to show off
its two sides The SCREEN is filled with the bright colors
then the dark colors

OUISA
You like You like Chaos Control
Chaos Control
SHE puts on a goofy happy face for the chaotic side and a
dopey tragic face for the geometric Yes Weve been here
before through OUISAs memory at the wedding

PAUL
Its wonderful
OUISA leans the painting against a chair the chaotic side
showing

MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
FLAN turns to JULIA

FLAN
Wassily Kandinsky Born 1866 Moscow Blue
Rider Exhibition 1914 He said It is clear
that the choice of object that is one of the
elements in the harmony of form must be decided
only by a corresponding vibration in the human
soul (very spiritual) Died 1944 France
JULIA nods Ah yes

BACK IN THE KITTREDGES LIVING ROOM
PAUL looks around the apartment so cozy warm

PAUL
Its the way they said it would be

FLAN

OUISA

joined the table

Sidney Poitiers There I dont care We have
to have truth He started out as a lawyer and

is terrified of libel Im not

INT THE WHITE WALL

PAUL leaning against the wall talks with great vivacity to

that OFF SCREEN PRESENCE who is the POV of the camera

PAUL
Sidney Poitier the future Jackie Robinson of
films was born the twenty fourth of February
1927 in Miami during a visit his parents made to
Florida - legally -to sell tomatoes they had
grown on their farm in the Bahamas He grew up
on Cat Island so poor they didnt even own
dirt he has said Neglected by his family my
father would sit on the shore and as he told
me many times conjure up the kind of worlds
that were on the other side and what Id do in
them He arrived in New York City from the
Bahamas in the winter of 1943 at age fifteen and
a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus
station across from the old Madison Square
Garden at Fiftieth and Eighth Avenue He moved
to the roof of the Brill building commonly
known as Tin Pan Alley Washed dishes at the
Turf restaurant for 411 a night He taught
0 himself to read by reading the newspaper In the
Black newspaper the theater page was opposite
the Want Ad page Among his 42 films are No Way
Out 1950 Cry the Beloved Country 1952
Blackboard Jungle 1955 The Defiant Ones 1958
Raisin in the Sun 1961 Lilies of the Field
1963 In the Heat of the Night 1967 To Sir With
Love 1967 Shoot to Kill 1988 and of course

PAUSE (THE OFF SCREEN VOICE JOINS HIM)
Guess Whos Coming To Dinner

PAUL (LAUGHS)
He won the Oscar for Lilies of the Field and
was twice named top male box-office star in
the country My father made no films from 1977
to 1987 but worked as director and author Dad
said to me once I still dont fully understand
how all that came about in the sequence it came
about
And we hear the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE applauding
PAUL bows happily
HE kicks his shoe off into the camera

BACK IN THE KITTREDGES LIVING ROOM

PAUL
Dads not in till tomorrow at the Sherry I
came down from Cambridge Thought Id stay at
some fleabag for adventure Orwell Down and
Out I really dont know New York I know Rome
and Paris and Los Angeles a lot better

PAUL

Sixteenth century Florence and theres genius on

GEOFFREY

friends with the son of Sidney Poitier barrier
breaker of the fifties and sixties

GEOFFREY

MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

OUISA
Even Geoffrey was touched

BACK IN THE KITTREDGES LIVING ROOM

PAUL
Im glad of that Dad and I went to Russia once

much his presence meant -

OUISA
Oh no Tell us stories of movie stars tying up
their children and being cruel

PAUL

PAUL

If I wanted to write a book about him I really

MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

OUISA
We movedinto the kitchen

BACK IN THE KITTREDGES KITCHEN

THE KITCHEN is large was built in the 205 when people had
big dinners at home

PAUL opens the refrigerators and freezers

PAULS actions are synchronous with the words

FLAN (VO)
We watched him cook

OUISA (VO)
We watched him cook and chop

FLAN (VO)
He sort of did wizardry

OUISA (VO)
An old jar of sun dried tomatoes--

FLAN (VO)

Left avers - tuna fish - olives - onions -

Its all dazzling and rapid FLAN opens the wine OUISA
takes dishes and silver out and hands them to GEOFFREY
EVERYONE is in a picnic spirit PAUL fills a large pot with
water from the tap

PAUL (to Geoffrey)

YOURE FROM

GEOFFREY
Johannesburg
PAUSE PAUL Studies GEOFFREY OUISA and FLAN freeze
Is it a tense moment
PAUL takes a breath PAUL puts the water on the fire eyes
never off GEOFFREY Then PAUL resumes chopping onions
briskly and dropping them into the frying pan

PAUL
My dad took me to a movie shot in South Africa
The camera moved from this vile rioting in the

streets to a villa where people picked at lunch

on a terrace the only riot the flowers and the

birds-- gorgeous plumage and petals And I

didnt understand And Dad said to me You meet

these young blacks who are having a terrible

time Theyve had a totally inadequate

education and yet in 76 - the year of the

Soweto riots - they took on a tremendous

political responsibility It just makes you

wonder at the maturity that is in them

PAUL opens a cabinet and takes out a Haitian candelabra that
obviously hasnt been used since it was brought home as a
souvenir PAUL dusts it off

PAUL
it makes you realize that the crummy childhood
theory that everything can be blamed in a
Freudian fashion on the fact that youve had a
bad upbringing just doesnt hold water May I

FLAN
Oh please
PAUL pours a brandy

GEOFFREY
What about being black in America
PAUL scoops a melange of vegetables into a glass dish and
puts it in the microwave

PAUL
My problem is Ive never felt American
I grew up in Switzerland Boarding school
Villa Rosey

OUISA
There is a boarding school in Switzerland that
takes you at age eighteen months

PAUL
Thats not me Ive never felt people liked me
for my connections Movie star kid problems
None of those
THE WATER boils HE dumps in pasta
The microwave timer goes off PAUL removes the glass dish

PAUL
But I never knew I was black in that racist way
0 till I was sixteen and came back here Very
protected White servants After the divorce we
moved to Switzerland My mother brother and Z
I dont feel American I dont even feel black
I suppose thats very lucky for me even though
Freud says theres no such thing as luck Just
what you make
PAUL takes the pasta off the boil and drains it plopping
the pasta into a brightly colored bowl
OUISA FLAN and GEOFFREY sit at the counter transfixed

OUISA
Does Freud say that
PAUL holds out three dishes heaped with food

PAUL
Heres dinner All ready

OUISA
Shall we move into the dining room
OUISA opens double doors leading into

THE DINING ROOM

This room has not been in use for a while
The overhead chandelier is very bright and harsh
A sewing machine is in the corner there
Bookkeeping items at one end of the long table
Nineteenth century Victorian mythological paintings hangon
the walls FLAN adjusts the rheostat to dim the lights in
the chandelier

OUISA

Dont look at the sewing machine

FLAN sweeps the bill things off the table onto a chair
OUISA opens the sideboard and takes out four linen place
mats and silverware and quickly sets the table

PAUL takes out matches and lights the Haitian cardeYabra
FLAN runs into the living room and returns with a vase of
flowers

HEY smile at the appearance of the sudden party in this
wonderful room

THEY sit down THEY eat Surprise Its delicious

PAUL

FLAN OUISA and GEOFFREY
Mmrmmm yes

GEOFFREY

PAUL leans back and watches them happily

OUISA

PAUL
The cook never eats

FLAN

PAUL leaves the room abruptly

FLAN OUISA and GEOFFREY look at each other
FLAN stands

bowls

PAUL

OUISA reaches for the bottle of wine

OUISA
Lets not be star fuckers

FLAN

PAUL

My father being an actor has no real identity
You say to him Pop whats new And he says

I got an interesting script today I was asked
to play a lumberjack up in the Yukon Now Ive
been trained as a Preacher but my church fell
apart My wife says we have to get mbney to get
through this winter And I sign up as part of
this team where all my beliefs are challenged
But I hold firm In spite of prejudice because

I want to get back to my wife Out of this
forestback to the church And my father is
in tears and I say Pop this i not a real
event this is some script that was sent to
you And my father says I m trying it out to
see how it fits on me But he has no life--he
has no memory--only the scripts producers send
him in the mail through his agents Thats his
past

MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
Can it be The CROWD listening to FLAN and OUISA is even
larger

OUISA
I just loved the kid so much I wanted to reach
out to him
FLAN
And then we asked him what his thesis was on

BACK IN THE KITTREDGES DINING ROOM

GEOFFREY
The one that was stolen Please

PAUL
Well
(HE takes a deep breath and leans back in

HIS CHAIR)
A substitute teacher out on Long Island was
dropped from his job for fighting with a
student A few weeks later the teacher
returned to the classroom shot the student
unsuccessfully held the class hostage and then
hot himself Successfully This fact caught my
ye last sentence Times A neighbor
escribed the teacher as a nice boy Always
eading Catcher In the Rye
he nitwit - Chapman - who shot John Lennon said
did it because he wanted to-draw the
ttention of the world to Catcher In the Rye and
he reading of that book would be his defense
nd young Hinckley the whiz kid who shot Reagan
nd his press secretary said if you want my
efense all you have to do is read catcher in
he Rye It seemed to be time to read it again

oO

too pdtoarHnAaan

FLAN
I havent read it in years
OUISA shushes FLAN

PAUL
I borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine
because I wanted to see what she had underlined
and I read this book to find out why this
touching beautiful sensitive story published
in July 1951 had turned into this manifesto of
hate

I started reading Its exactly as I
remembered Everybodys a phoney Page two My
brothers in Hollywood being a prostitute
Page three what a phony slob his father was
Page nine People never notice anything

Then on page twenty two my hair stood up
Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive
sensitive youth--wearing his red hunters cap
A deer Hunter hat Like hell it is I sort of
closed one eye like I was taking aim at it
This is a people shooting hat I shoot people
in this hat

PAUL (CONTINUES)

Hmmm I said This book is preparing people for
bigger moments in their lives than I ever
dreamed of
Then on p 89 Id rather push a guy out the
window or chop his head off with an ax than sock
him in the jaw I hate fist fightswhat
scares me most is the other guys face
finished the book Its a touching story
comic because the boy wants to do so much and
cant do anything Hates all phoniness and only
lies to others Wants everyone to like him is
only hateful and is completely self involved
n other words a pretty accurate picture of a
male adolescent
FLAN OUISA GEOFFREY are transfixed

And what alarms me about that book--not the book
so much as the aura about it--is this the book
is primarily about paralysis The boy cant
function And at the end before he can run
away and start a new life it starts to rain and
he folds Now theres nothing wrong in writing
about emotional and intellectual paralysis It
may indeed thanks to Chekhov and Samuel Beckett
be the great modern theme
The extraordinary last lines of Waiting For

Godot--Lets go Yes lets go Stage
directions They do not move

But the aura around this book of Salingers--
which perhaps should be read by everyone ut
young men---is this It mirrors like a fun

house mirror and amplifies like a distorted
speaker one of the great tragedies of our times-
--the death of the imagination

Because what else is paralysis

The CAMERA moves closer and closer in on PAUL

PAUL (CONTINUES)

The imagination has been so debased that
imagination--being imaginative-- rather than
being the lynch pin of our existence now stands
as a synonym for something outside ourselves
like Science fiction or some new use for
tangerine slices on raw pork chops---what an
imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars So
imaginative and Star Trek--so imaginative And
Lord of the Rings--all those dwarves--so

IMAGINATIVE---
he imagination has moved out of the realm of
eing our link our most personal link with our
nner lives and the world outside that world--
his world we share--what is schizophrenia but a
orrifying state where whats in here doesnt
atch up with whats out there
hy has imagination become a synonym for style
believe that the imagination is the passport
e create to take us into the real world
believe the imagination is another phrase for
hat is most uniquely Is

ZHEHSB OAH O

Jung says the greatest sin is to be unconscious
Our boy Holden says what scares me most is the
other guys face--it wouldnt be so bad if you
could both be blindfolded--most of the time the
faces we face are not the other guys but our
own faces And its the worst kind of

yellowness to be so scared of yourself you put
blindfolds on rather than deal with yourself
To face ourselves

Thats the hard thing

The imagination

Thats Gods gift to make the act of self-
examination bearable

PAUSE
FLAN GEOFFREY OUISA are very moved

THEY embrace THE CAMERA comes in very close circling
FLAN and OUISA their love their safety Then THE CAMERA
drifts back and away from them travelling out through the
window out of their cocoon to

EXT THE APARTMENT BUILDINGCENTRAL PARK NIGHT

down the face of the solid apartment building and drifts
away through the night down into Central Park and stops at
the statue of the husky barking at the moon

MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
OUISA
I dreamt of Sidney Poitier and his rise to
acclaim I dreamt that Sidney Poitier sat at
the edge of my bed and I asked him what troubled
him Sidney What troubles you Is it right
to make a movie of Cats

BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM

FLAN is asleep on his side of the bed OUISA is wide awake
staring at A MAN in dinner clothes who sits on the edge of
her bed His back is to the camera Is it SIDNEY POITIER
THE CAMERA drifts in to OUISA who is transfixed by this
apparition

SIDNEY (very comforting)

Ill tell you why I have to make a movie of

Cats I know what Cats is Louisa May call

you Louisa
(OUISA nods Yes)
I have no illusions about the merits of Cats
But the world has been too heavy with all the
right to lifers Protect the lives of the
unborn Constitutional amendments Marches

When does life begin Or the converse The end

of life The Right To Die Why is life at this

point in the 20th century so focussed on the

very beginning of life and the very end of life

What about the eighty years we have to live

between those two inexorable book ends

THE CAMERA closes on OUISA Her face seen over SIDNEYs
shoulder is all wonder

OUISA
And you can get all that into Cats
THE CAMERA drifts round with OUISAS gaze to finally see
SIDNEYS face i¢
It is PAUL

PAUL SIDNEY
Im going to try
OUISA
Thank you Thank you You shall
THE CAMERA circles off PAUL to OUISA She is asleep
CUT BACK to reveal
No one is sitting on the bed
THE CAMERA moves onto FLANs face sleeping
Slides of paintings by Matisse Picasso De Kooning Pollock
appear over his face

FLAN (VO)

his is what I dreamt I didnt dream so much
s realize this I felt so close to the
aintings I wasnt just selling like pieces

f meat I remembered why I loved paintings in
he first place - what had got me into this -
nd I thought - dreamed - remembered-

actotwcwon

INT AIRPLANE HANGAR
FLAN happily sits in the bright vast empty space at a slide
carousel projecting slides of paintings into the air

FLAN (VO)

How easy it is for a painter to lose a

painting He can paint and paint - work ona

canvas for months and one day he loses it - just

loses the structure - loses the sense of it -

you lose the painting
A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT shines on FLAN who turns to see
A TEACHER in her forties very pure and happy hanging
beautiful and brilliantly colored childrens drawings in the
air FLANS VOICE echoes in this vast space

FLAN
Why are all your students geniuses in the second
grade Look at the first grade Blotches of
green and black Look at third grade
Camouflage But the second grade --your grade
Matisses everyone Youve made my child a
Matisse Let me study with you Let me into
the second grade What is your secret

THE TEACHER
Secret I dont have any secret I just know

when to take their drawings away from them

THE TEACHER hangs pink shapes like paper versions of PAULS
button down shirt on a clothes line stretching to the end of
the hangar

THE SCREEN is filled with the color Pin

OUISA walks through

THE LIVING ROOM

and goes into

THE KITCHEN

OUISA looks at the spotlessly clean sink and counter

SHE flicks on the coffee machine and takes juice out of the
refrigerator scanning the front page

SHE sits at the counter and opens the magazine to the back
page and begins to do the cross word puzzle

MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
THE CHUMS hang on OUISAs every word

OUISA
I sat in the kitchen happily doing the cross
word puzzle in ink Everybody does it in ink I

BACK IN THE KITCHEN
OUISA fills in a word on the puzzle is it in ink Then
looks up

OUISA (VO)

OUISA puts the puzzle down and goes into

THE HALL

OUISA (VO)
The hall is eighteen feet long
OUISA walks down the hall which now seems impossibly long

THE HUSTLER turns and smiles at FLAN and OUISA -

HUSTLER

FLAN

THE HUSTLER stretches out on the sofa

HUSTLER

FLAN tips the sofa hurling the HUSTLER onto the floor
THE HUSTLER leaps at FLAN threateningly

OUISA
Stop it He might have a gun

HUSTLER (laughs)
Yeah I might have a gun I might have a knife
THE HUSTLER raises his hand threateningly

OUISA

He has a gun He has a knife

THE HUSTLER chases OUISA around the room

FLAN chases the HUSTLER THE DOG chases FLAN

PAUL dressed runs in to the living room carrying THE
HUSTLERs clothes which HE hurls down onto the sofa

PAUL

and their story

FLAN
--the details he knew--how would he know about
the painting
FLAN has taken the Kandinsky off the wall and flipped it
around to the wild side

FLAN
Although I think its a very fine Kandinsky
FLAN leans the painting against a chair and studies it

OUISA
And none of you knows this fellow He has this
wild quality--yet a real elegance and a real
concern and a real consideration
TESS looks at the floral arrangement PAUL sent
Its only slightly wilted

TESS
Well Mom you should have let
him stay You should have divorced
all your children and just let this
dreamboat stay Plus he sent you flowers

FLAN
And jam

THE KIDS
Oooooo

OUISA

I wish I knew how to get hold of his father
Just to see if there is any truth in it

OUISA sits up when SHE hears someone tapping insistently on
the window pane SHE looks around the room

PAUL appears outside on the window ledge wearing the pink
shirt OUISA gets out of bed and opens the window

PAUL
The imagination Thats our out Our
imagination teaches us our limits and then how
to grow beyond those limits The imagination
says listen to me I at your darkest voice I
am your 4am voice I am the voice that wakes
you up and says this is what Im afraid of Do
not listen to me at your peril The
imagination is the noon voice that sees clearly
and says yes this is what I want for my life
Its there to sort out your nightmare to show
you the exit from the maze of-your nightmare to
transform the nightmare into dreams that become
your bedrock If we dont listen to that voice
it dies It shrivels It vanishes
(PAUL takes out a switch blade and opens it)
The imagination is not our escape on the
contrary the imagination is the place we are
all trying to get to
PAUL lifts his shirt and stabs himself
OQUISA screams
PAUL falls over backward into space
The phone rings waking OUISA FLAN picks up the phone
OUISA sits up a little stunned She is relieved to find
things so normal

FLAN
Who in your high school part of your gang has
become homosexual or is deep into drugs

TESS
Thats like about fifteen people
TESS enjoys her echo because it makes FLAN and OUISA
uncomfortable

LARKIN
I dont want to know

TESS

that it has to be a guy This movie stars son
could have had a relationship with a girl in

FLAN and OUISA try to shush them

OUISA
It wasnt just that It was fun

TESS
You went to Cats You said it was an all time
low in a lifetime of theater going
OUISA considers

OUISA
Film is a different medium

TESS
You said Aeschylus did not invent theater to
have it end up a bunch of chorus kids wondering
which of them will go to Kitty Kat Heaven

OUISA
I dont remember saying that

FLAN
No I think that was Starlight Express -

Well maybe hell make a movie of Starlight
Express and you can all be on roller skates

WOODY saunters up to his PARENTS
HE is very cool
FLAN and OUISA smile at his sweet attitude

WOODY
I just want to get one thing straight

FLAN
Finally we hear from the peanut gallery
And WOODY screams at THEM in rage his voice echoing
mindless of the STUDENTS who freeze in the background as you
would at a traffic accident

WOODY
You gave him my pink shirt You gave a complete
stranger my pink shirt That pink shirt was a
Christmas present from you I treasured that
shirt I loved that shirt My collar size has
grown a full size from weight lifting And you
saw my arms had grown you saw my neck had
grown And you bought me that shirt for my new
body I loved that shirt The first shirt for
my new body And you gave that shirt away I
cant believe it I hate this life I hate
you

OUISA
read somewhere that everybody on this planet
is separated by only six other people Six
degrees of separation Between us and everybody
else on this planet The President of the
United States A gondolier in Venice Fill in
the names I find that A tremendously
comforting that were so close and B like
Chinese water torture that were so close
Because you have to find the right six people to
make the connection Its not just big names

Its anyone A native in a rain forest A

Tierra del Fuegan An Eskimo I am bound to
everyone on this planet by a trail of six
people Its a profound thought How Paul found
us How to find the man whose son he pretends to
be Or perhaps jand his son although I doubt it
How every person is a new door opening up into
other worlds Six degrees of separation between
me and everyone else on this planet But to

find the right six people

THE GUEST OF HONOR
Why does it mean so much to you

OUISA
He wanted to be us Everything we are in the
world this paltry thing--our life--he wanted
it He stabbed himself to get into our lives
He envied us Were not enough to be envied

FLAN
Like the papers said We have hearts

OUISA
Having a heart is not the point We were hardly
taken in We believed him -- for a few hours

He did more for us in a few hours than our
children ever did He wanted to be your
child Dont let that go He sat out in that
park and said that man is my father Hes in
trouble and we dont know how to help him

FLAN
Help him He couldve killed me And you
THE GUESTS agree

OUISA
You were attracted to him -

FLAN throws down his napkin in mock outrage Almogj mock
outrage

FLAN
Cut me out of that pathology You are
on your own —
OUISA
Attracted by youth and his talent and the
embarrassing prospect of being in the movie
version of Cats Did you put that in your Times
piece And we turn him into anecdote to dine out
on Like this As we are right now But it was
an experience I will not turn him into an
anecdote How do we fit what happened to us
into life without turning it into an anecdote
with no teeth and a punch line well mouth over
and over for years to come Tell the story
about the imposter who came into our lives---
That reminds me of the time this boy-- And
we become these human juke boxes spilling out
these anecdotes But it was an experience How
do we keep the experience

OUISA looks at FLAN clinically FLAN frowns and turns back
to his dinner partner brightly

Cezanne would leave blank spaces in his
canvasses if he couldnt account for the brush
stroke give a reason for the color

OUISA
Then I am a collage of unaccounted-for brush
strokes I an all random
