FADE IN
Stars shine through the darkness of space

Suddenly the void seems to CONTORT Space FOLDS IN ON ITSELF
as a TUNNEL OF PULSATING LIGHT appears A wormhole

A SPHERICAL CAPSULE emerges from the tunnel -- a spaceship
futuristic in design but badly damaged trailing smoke and
debris as if its been on the receiving end of an
intergalactic ass-kicking

The capsule WHIZZES PAST wiping frame to REVEAL --

Earth Dark blue seas under fleecy white clouds PUSH INTO --

INT STAR CAPSULE - NIGHT

THE PILOT is ensconced in a glass cockpit his face largely
obscured by a HEAVY MASK

DATA superimposes over the viewscreen including the date --
JUNE 4 2013 The Pilot curses under his breath

THE PILOT
All right lets find a soft spot
to set her down Initiate landing
sequence

COMPUTER VOICE
Warning Main power at nine
percent Core destabilizing Re-
entry not advised
The Pilot switches to manual navigation and THROTTLES DOWN --

EXT SPACE - NIGHT

TRACKING WITH THE CAPSULE as its drawn into the Earths
atmosphere blazing like a comet

INT STAR CAPSULE - NIGHT

SPARKS and SMOKE and SCREAMING ALARMS --

COMPUTER VOICE
Main power at seven percent Six
percent Five percent

The Pilot glances to a GROUP PHOTOGRAPH wedged onto the
console SIX ASTRONAUTS in MATCHING FLIGHTSUITS The
photograph is smeared with blood

Darkness ahead a STORM SYSTEM gathering strength over the
northeastern United States The view through the cockpit
window transitions from BLAZING FIRE to SWIRLING CLOUDS and
POCKETS of LIGHTNING

The Pilot closes his eyes straining under the jaw-rattling G-
forces He whispers under his breath an unheard prayer

Gradually turbulence fades The ship steadies A moment of
relief broken by a SCREAMING ALARM --

COMPUTER VOICE
Warning Terrain Warning Pull up

Storm clouds break to REVEAL --
The ground coming up fast Too fast The Pilot PULLS UP as
the capsule plummets for a heavily-wooded area struggling to

level off

Just before the moment of impact The Pilots eyes flick down
to the blood-stained photograph --

-- to one woman in particular -- before we CUT TO --

EXT BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

Kids playing baseball on a summer afternoon Bottom of the
ninth score tied winning run at the plate From the CHANTS
of the crowds his name must be Tommy --

TOMMY ARCHER 16 the very picture of stoic concentration He
taps dirt from his cleats meeting eyes with the PITCHER
who doesnt seem too happy to see him

IN THE STANDS we find BONNIE ARCHER late 30s cheering
louder than every other parent in attendance

BONNIE
Come on Tommy focus Youve got
this

TRACK THROUGH THE CROWDS until we find a SMALL KID weaving
through the legs of the spectators This is ADAM ARCHER --
twelve years old but easily mistaken for nine half a foot
shorter than everyone else in his class

Adam strains to peer over shoulders but hes not watching
the game His attention is fixed on SUSIE WILCOX 15 -- every
kids first crush standing alone at the fence

Adam finishes off a can of purple-flavored soda as if it were
liquid courage He tries to crush the can Cant Frustrated
he approaches

For a moment Susie doesnt even realize hes there

ADAM
Hey Susie

Susie turns -- looking too high She glances down to find
Adam (shorter than she expected) grinning up at her

SUSIE
Hey Andy right

Adam is about to correct her when -- CRACK Tommy hits a
LINE DRIVE HOMERUN deep into center field

The CROWD GOES WILD as Tommy rounds the bases -- so fast he
nearly overtakes one of the other runners Adam is still
trying to get Susies attention He indicates Tommy --

ADAM
Thats my brother

Susie snaps a look at Adam --

SUSIE
Really

Adam smiles nods Susie leans in

SUSIE
Do you think you can introduce me

The smile fades Not what he was trying to accomplish
ON THE FIELD Tommy comes into home winning the game
instantly surrounded by teammates Adam is left alone at the

fence watching as Tommy is swept away in a sea of admirers

INT BONNIES CAR - DAY

Bonnie drives sneaking sidelong glances at Adam who stares
absently out the window Trying to break the silence --

BONNIE
I talked to Coach Zimmer He says
you can try out for the team next
year if you want

ADAM
Why bother I cant run I cant
hit I cant even breathe

BONNIE
Well not with that attitude
ADAM
Besides the cut-offs fourteen
Im too young

BONNIE
Coach Z says hes willing to make
an exception He says if your genes
are half as good as Tommys --

ADAM
Theyre not half as good thats
the whole point Please dont make
me try out

BONNIE
Make you When have I ever made you
do anything

ADAM
(ticking them off)
The football team The soccer team
The marching band The wrestling
team You know this arm still
doesnt bend all the way back

BONNIE
Really

Adam demonstrates the deformity Bonnie waves it off

BONNIE
Oh youre fine

ADAM
Face it Mom Im not Tommy

Bonnie looks to Adam but hes already turned back out the
window disengaging She doesnt know what to say

EXT FARMINGTON HILLS - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

A lonely cul de sac on the edge of untamed wilderness
Thunder RUMBLES distantly a storm on the horizon

INT ARCHER RESIDENCE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

A labrador retriever named BOSCO follows faithfully underfoot
as Adam stomps upstairs He pauses in front of Tommys room --

The shelves are stacked with TROPHIES -- MVP All-State
Football tae kwon do even a science fair ribbon The
surrounding room is filled with SPACE MEMORABILIA including
a FULLY ASSEMBLED SHUTTLE MODEL Adam notices a SPACE-THEMED
COMIC BOOK lying nearby He takes it -- glances to Bosco --
ADAM
Dont tell on me okay

Off Boscos reaction just happy for the attention

INT ADAMS BEDROOM - NIGHT

A SNOWBOARDER swooshes through a half-pipe on a giant plasma
screen Adam is focused on the game working the balance
board like a pro with a style all his own until hes
interrupted by a LIGHT KNOCK on the door He turns off the
game and dives into bed where a textbook is waiting

ADAM
Come in

Bonnie enters modeling a skirt and blouse hair tied tightly
back She spins --

BONNIE
What do you think

ADAM
Is it a date or a job interview

BONNIE
Little of both I guess

ADAM
What was wrong with the last guy
BONNIE
Carl I dont know He was nice
Unambitious

(sensing Adams tone)
You think Im being too picky

ADAM
No I think its encouraging for a
woman your age

Ouch Bonnie takes a seat on the foot of the bed

BONNIE
Okay I deserved that Im not
being picky for me you know Its
all for you

ADAM
Why Im not gonna date him

BONNIE
No but Tommys grown and youre
halfway there

(MORE )
BONNIE (CONTD)
I just dont want you going the
rest of the way without some kind
of male influence in your life

ADAM
Youre close enough

BONNIE
Thanks I think

Bonnie comes to her point --

BONNIE
Listen You dont have to try out
for the team if you dont want to
I know youre not Tommy I know
things dont come so easy for you
(conspiratorial)

But you know what I think thats
what makes you stronger

ADAM
Stronger than Tommy Have you met
Tommy

BONNIE

Who knows You might surprise
yourself But if you dont try
youll never know

Bonnie turns Adams textbook right-side-up (its been upside-
down this whole time) With a smile she heads for the door

ADAM
Mom
(off her look)
You look nice
Bonnie beams

ADAM
I mean --

BONNIE
No no stop there Stop at sweet

ADAM
-- for a mom --

BONNIE
-- cant hear you already gone

She closes the door behind her
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Tommy sits watching TV ON SCREEN amateur footage of a
FLAMING OBJECT crashing out of the sky -- the star capsule

REPORTER (0C)
-- obtained this exclusive footage
of the unidentified object which
crashed somewhere over Oakland
County late last night

Bonnie passes behind Tommy in a hurry --

BONNIE
Okay Im headed out Watch your
brother okay

TOMMY
(fixed on the screen)
Did you see this That thing
crashed like five miles from here

BONNIE

Hey Are you listening
TOMMY

Yeah I got it watch the insect
BONNIE

Dont call him that
TOMMY

(yeah yeah)

Have a good date
Bonnie gives herself one last look in the mirror and then
shes gone Tommy rewinds the TiVo to watch the footage of
the crashing object one more time He shakes his head

TOMMY
Thats no meteor

EXT ARCHER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

DISTANT POV -- Bonnie gets in her car and drives off A HAND
comes into frame and pulls back a branch Someones watching

INT ARCHER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

The house is silent and dark Tommy crosses to a window Hes
about to climb down when suddenly --

ADAM (0C)
What are you doing
Tommy spins -- Adam CLICKS ON a flashlight and shines it into
Tommys eyes

TOMMY
Jesus You scared me Kill the
light Kickstand

ADAM
Dont call me that Why are you
sneaking out

TOMMY
You know Mom has the neighbors spy
on us If she comes back tell her
Im out studying with Walter

ADAM
Okay What are you really doing

From below a FAMILIAR VOICE --

SUSIE (0C)
Hey Tommy Whats taking so long

Adam glances out the window to find SUSIE WILCOX waiting
below Tommy smiles letting the implication speak for
itself

TOMMY
Studying With Walter

Adam is heartbroken but not surprised Tommy hesitates
misinterpreting his brothers expression as fear

TOMMY
Hey If youre scared to stay here
by yourself --

ADAM
Im not scared

He said that louder than intended MUFFLED LAUGHTER from
below Now Susies laughing at him Adam looks like he wants
to disappear into a black hole Tommy flashes an appeasing
smile ruffles Adams hair Adam jerks back annoyed

TOMMY
Good boy

With that Tommy VAULTS out the open window shimmies down
the drainpipe and lands with an IMPRESSIVE FLIP

PUSH IN ON ADAM watching his brother disappear with Susie
He repeats almost to himself --
ADAM
Im not

A THUNDERCLAP startles Adam BANGING his head on the
windowsill He pulls the window closed with a SLAM

EXT ARCHER RESIDENCE â€” NIGHT

The storm RAGES lightning FLASHES rain sheets down

INT ADAMS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam lies in bed with the lights on flipping through the
comic he stole from Tommys room

ON THE PAGE bold letters are splashed across an illustration
of a futuristic spaceship WELCOME TO THE FUTURE

Suddenly POWER GOES OUT Adam groans climbs out of bed

EXT ARCHER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Adam runs through the rain coat held over his head He
reaches the BREAKER BOX and is about to flip the switch when
a NOISE spins him around --

He switches on his flashlight and examines the rain-soaked
yard Nothing there False alarm

Adam is about to turn back to the breaker when the NOISE
REPEATS louder -- coming from the shed A SHADOW drifts past
the lone window No doubt about it someones in there

Panicked Adam starts to run back for the house when
something stops him He turns back to the shed A look of
STOIC DETERMINATION fills his eyes He steps forward

INT SHED - NIGHT

Adam approaches -- an OPEN LOCK hanging from the door He
pushes through --

SOUNDS of RUMMAGING nearby -- a SHADOWY FIGURE is rifling
through the contents of the shed selecting VARIOUS TOOLS and
tossing them into a pile on the floor

A floorboard CREAKS under Adams weight He ducks into hiding
as the figure TURNS to REVEAL --

Its THE PILOT from the star capsule -- recognizable only by
his eyes -- dark brown with SPECKS OF GREEN A rare anomaly

The Pilot illuminates the shed with a POWERFUL BEAM that
emanates from a device that looks like an ADVANCED IPHONE

Content that hes alone The Pilot goes back to work
selecting his tools failing to notice as a SMALL HAND picks
up a socket wrench from the pile behind him and --

CRACK The wrench makes SOLID CONTACT with the back of The
Pilots head The Pilot slowly turns to meet eyes with his
attacker --

ADAM stands there wet and trembling holding the wrench like
he knows how to use it The Pilot blinks woozy

THE PILOT
You

Adam frowns me With that The Pilots eyes ROLL BACK and he
crumples to the floor Adam drops by The Pilots side --
amazed overwhelmed -- he cant believe he just did that

ADAM
Oh my God oh my God
(then smiling)
Oh my God

Adam takes a closer look at this stranger --

Hes wearing a FLIGHTSUIT with an insignia that reads
NEXTSTAR CORP Something protrudes from an open pocket Adam
delicately reaches down and pulls out --

A familiar blood-stained photograph six astronauts in
matching jumpsuits The Pilot is in the middle his arm slung
around the shoulder of a man whose face is obscured by dried
blood Adam chips away the blood to reveal the face

Suddenly The Pilots hand SNAPS OUT clutching the
photograph Adam YELPS and brings the wrench down once more --

THUD Ouch
CUT TO BLACK
Sounds of rain fade to a gentle shower

INT SHED - NIGHT

ON THE PILOT coming to His vision focuses -- ADAM stands
opposite clutching his inhaler ready for anything

REVEAL -- The Pilot has been tied to a chair The binding job
is needlessly elaborate employing a lot of rope a lot of
tape and even a garden hose for good measure

THE PILOT
- what happened

ADAM
I knocked you out Try anything
funny and Ill do it again

The Pilot is struggling to wrap his head around that He

peers at Adam -- this weak asthmatic kid --
THE PILOT
Â« you
Adam nods and takes a hit off his inhaler -- somehow making

that seem like a badass gesture He throws down the lock that
he found hanging from the shed door It CLANKS at The Pilots
feet

ADAM
Only three people know the
combination to that lock Me my
brother and my Dad And my Dads
gone so howd you open it

As The Pilot explains we notice that hes starting to work
free of his bonds fumbling through the restraints

THE PILOT
lucky guess I take it youve
already called the cops

ADAM
I will if you dont tell me the
truth

For some reason that makes The Pilot smile

THE PILOT
The truth Sure why not The truth
is I am an astronaut

ADAM
An astronaut

THE PILOT
From the future

ADAM
The future

THE PILOT
Yes I have to repair my spaceship
and complete my mission or the
future as you know it -- as you
will know it -- will cease to
exist Any information beyond that
is strictly classified

A long pause Adam pulls out a cellphone and starts dialing

THE PILOT
What are you doing

ADAM
Im calling my mom Shes way worse
than the cops

THE PILOT
I believe you Listen

The Pilot trails off when he sees that the phone in Adams
hands isnt a normal phone -- its the iPhone-looking device

we saw The Pilot using earlier

THE PILOT
-- whered you get that

ADAM
I took it from you Its called
stealing something you obviously
know a lot about
(he cant get it to work)
What is it anyway like an iPhone

For the first time The Pilot seems genuinely scared He
desperately fumbles with his bonds trying to get free

THE PILOT
Listen kid could you point it
another way --

ADAM
-- I dont recognize these apps --

THE PILOT
-- Adam --

The Pilot FREES HIMSELF just as the device ACTIVATES
emitting a SHOCKWAVE that PROPELS Adam and The Pilot back off
their feet DEMOLISHING the roof of the shed in the process
Splinters fall like rain

The Pilot recovers He retrieves the smoking gadget from Adam
-- now and forever known as the ATHENS DEVICE Adam looks up
at this flightsuited stranger Seeing him with new eyes

ADAM
not an iPhone

The Pilot shakes his head no

ADAM
Â« astronaut
The Pilot nods his head yes

ADAM
- from the future

The Pilot nods again yes Now hes getting it

Adam pulls himself to his feet -- the gears in his head
whirling -- until only one question remains A slow smile

ADAM
Spaceship

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Adam follows The Pilot into the woods struggling to keep up
The Pilot scans the area searching for something

ADAM
This is incredible No ones gonna
believe that an astronaut crashed
in my backyard And from the
future
(a sudden thought)

- wait a minute Youre not here
to terminate anyone are you

THE PILOT
Not yet My ship crashed more than
a decade short of its target The
sooner I get out of here and get on
with my mission the better

ADAM
Whats your mission

THE PILOT
Cant tell you Classified

ADAM
Oh come on who do you think Im
gonna tell Who do you think would
believe me

THE PILOT
Doesnt matter From this point
forward the less you know about
me the better

ADAM
Why Because of the ripples

THE PILOT
(a backwards glance)
the ripples

ADAM
Yeah I mean how does it work Can
you cause a ripple in the past that
changes the future like in Back to
the Future or are you creating an
alternate reality to branch off
from this one like in Star Trek

THE PILOT
Thats uh classified

ADAM
Can you at least tell me what year
youre from

THE PILOT
Nope Classified

ADAM
Well whats the future like

THE PILOT
Its very classified

ADAM
What are we looking for out here

KONK Adam COLLIDES into SOMETHING INVISIBLE and falls flat
on his ass The Pilot is relieved --

THE PILOT
Finally I swear I can never
remember where I parked the damn
thing

The Pilot activates his Athens device -- pushes a button --

THE PILOT
You might want to stand back

Suddenly the air around Adam starts to SHIMMER --
THE STAR CAPSULE UNCLOAKS towering over him standing TWO
STORIES TALL PUSH IN on Adam taking it in overwhelmed He

smiles --

ADAM
Welcome to the future

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The Pilot has scaled the shell of the ship hes using the
tools he stole from the shed to pry open an access panel FAR

BELOW Adam calls up to The Pilot -- mid-argument --
ADAM
Come on its not like I want to
leave the galaxy just -- take me

around the moon or something
Whats the big deal

THE PILOT
First its not an amusement park
ride Second you arent trained
Third what are you nine

ADAM
Im twelve

THE PILOT
(a glance down)
Really Late bloomer

Adam flips The Pilot the bird
KA-CHUNK The Pilot finishes peeling away the panel A SOFT

BLUE GLOW shines from within Slowly reverently he reaches
in and pulls out --

THE CELIUM CORE A blue orb about the size and shape of a
softball pulsating with an unknown self-generated light

ADAM
What is that And dont say
classified

THE PILOT
I was worried it was damaged in the
crash Its celium -- an elemental

energy harvested from the deepest
regions of the Earth Its what
makes it all possible Time travel
superluminal flight all of it

ADAM
Cool
(beat)
Can I have it

The Pilot looks down at Adam youve gotta be kidding Adam
shrugs worth a shot

MOMENTS LATER The Pilot shimmies down the length of the
capsule landing with an IMPRESSIVE FLIP -- the same move we
saw Tommy employ earlier He assesses the ships damage

THE PILOT
Ill need a day maybe two to get
her off the ground All I need from
you is to keep my presence here a
secret until I finish my repairs
Do you think you can handle that

ADAM
Depends Whats in it for me

THE PILOT
For starters I wont lock you in
the ships brig until Im ready to
take off

ADAM
You wouldnt

The Pilot gives Adam his best poker face but ultimately
caves his bluff called --

THE PILOT
What do you want from me kid
Stock tips

ADAM
I told you I want to help

THE PILOT
And how do you think you can help

Adam isnt sure he wants to broach this but sees no choice --
ADAM
- I can tell you something

Something you should probably know

THE PILOT
Whats that

The Pilot notices Adam is backing away from him The Pilots
expression darkens Uh-oh He matches Adams pace forward

ADAM
Before when you were passed out

THE PILOT
Yeah

ADAM
I uh I sort of

THE PILOT
Adam What Did You Do

INT ARCHER RESTDENCE - FOYER - NIGHT

POLICE LIGHTS strobe red-and-blue in the driveway as Adam
stands alone at the door talking to TWO COPS

COP 1
A noise You heard a noise

ADAM
Yeah like a boom -- boom -- boom
I thought maybe someone broke in
but it was just the storm

COP 2
Are you here by yourself

ADAM
Thats why I got scared Youre not
gonna tell my Mom are you

As Adam speaks PULL BACK to REVEAL -- THE PILOT crouched
hiding about ten feet away Athens device in hand Bosco
immediately comes up and starts licking his face

THE PILOT
No -- no bad dog Bad Dog

ON COP 1 craning his neck to peer into the house All he
sees is Boscos tail swishing happily back and forth

COP 1
- do you mind if we step inside a
minute

Hes already letting himself in but Adam blocks his path

ADAM
Sorry Im not supposed to let
strangers into the house

COP 1
Youre not supposed to call the
cops over a thunderstorm either

COP 2
Hey cmon give the kid a break
You remember being that age dont
you

in

COP 1
Not really

COP 2
(to Adam friendly)
What are you nine

It pains him to the core but Adam nods yes Cop 2 gives
Cop 1 an imploring look and Cop 1 relents --

COP 1
All right well let this one
slide Just remember 911s only
for emergencies all right

ADAM
Yes sir

COP 2
Lock this door when were gone

The cops head off Adam starts to push the door closed when
he sees BONNIES CAR pulling up at the curb Bonnie is out in
a panic running for the house

BONNIE
Oh my God what happened ADAM

COP 1
Hes fine maam just a little
misunderstanding
Adam SLAMS the door and runs for The Pilots hiding spot --
ADAM
Hey you gotta get out of here my

moms --

-- but The Pilot is gone Shit

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The Pilot explores the house pausing in front of a SHELF of
FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS One in particular catches his eye -- Adam
and Tommy are posed with their FATHER several years earlier

The Pilot is so caught up staring at the photograph he
hardly notices as Adam comes barreling into the room --

ADAM
What are you doing My Moms home

THE PILOT
What

ADAM
Hide

Too late -- a light FLICKS ON and Bonnie comes in a
maelstrom of maternal concern

BONNIE
Adam

She pulls up short at the sight of The Pilot Frozen moment
They all just stare at each other until The Pilot flashes
a smile and extends a hand --

THE PILOT
Hey there You must be Adams Mom
Mike Denton Nice to finally meet
you

Bonnie doesnt take The Pilots hand

BONNIE
Whats going on here

THE PILOT
Huh I guess your son hasnt
mentioned me after all
(to Adam reprimanding)
I told you Adam Its nothing to
be ashamed of Needing a tutor

Adam and Bonnie register this with comically matching
expressions A tutor Suddenly TOMMY comes bursting in

TOMMY
Mom what happened to the shed --
(he stops re The Pilot)
Whos this

Adam chimes in quickly --

ADAM
Hes my uh tutor Science tutor

THE PILOT
Adam just got a little scared
being left here alone and all

Bonnie shoots Tommy a burning look Alone
THE PILOT

I dont live far so he gave me a
call and I came right over

BONNIE
Well thank you Mr -- sorry
what was your name again
The Pilot hesitates -- for a second he cant remember the
name he obviously made up -- but it comes back to him --
THE PILOT

Mike Denton

BONNIE
Out of curiosity whos paying you

Adam thinks fast --

ADAM
I am I didnt want you to know I
needed help so I saved my
allowance and paid him myself

Tommy regards Adam with suspicion The Pilot feigns surprise

THE PILOT
Youre kidding Your own allowance
(to Bonnie)
I swear I had no idea

BONNIE
Well that ends now Im more than
happy to pay How much do I owe you
for tonight

THE PILOT
No no please It was my pleasure

BONNIE
At least let me make it up to you
For the inconvenience How about
dinner tomorrow My treat

Something in Bonnies tone tells The Pilot she wont be
taking no for an answer He gives in with a smile

EXT ARCHER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Adam and Bonnie send The Pilot off from the doorway --

BONNIE
Are you sure you dont need a ride

THE PILOT
Its no problem I live close See
you tomorrow Adam Well make some
progress on that science project

Wink wink Adam catches the drift He nods speechless as
The Pilot heads off down the street Finally Adam turns to
address his mothers withering gaze --

ADAM
- Im sorry I lied

But Bonnie just pulls him into a hug

BONNIE
Im just glad youre okay
Over his mothers shoulder Adam meets eyes with Tommy --
casually chucking a ball into his open glove not bothering
to hide his mistrust THUD -- THUD -- THUD --

INT ADAMS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam lies in bed He looks up as Tommy darkens his doorway

TOMMY
Hey

ADAM
Hey

TOMMY

So You hired a tutor

ADAM
Yep

TOMMY
With your own allowance

Adam says nothing

TOMMY
Its funny cause I thought you
were saving for a wii
(he regards the console)
That one there

ADAM
I -- won that off Joe On a bet

TOMMY
Really Whatd you bet

ADAM
That youd hit two homers in your
game against Southfield You hit
three so he had to kick in the
extra controls

Tommy stares at Adam -- through him -- then nods giving up
the line of questioning for now

TOMMY
All right Next time you need help
just ask me Thats what Im here
for

Tommy heads off Once alone Adam pulls out the space comic --
An illustration of a square-jawed astronaut smiles out at

him ADVENTURES THROUGH SPACE AND TIME WITH ASTRONAUT MIKE
DENTON

Adam frowns He looks from the comic to Tommys departing
shadow his own suspicions starting to form

EXT OPEN FIELD - NIGHT

A METEOR SHOWER is in progress streaks of light racing
across the nighttime sky Strangely one of the meteors seems
to be going the WRONG DIRECTION -- getting larger closer

A BURST OF FIRE as the meteor breaches the atmosphere and
CRASHES DOWN into the field Its another star capsule

The door HISSES OPEN and a MAN EMERGES descending the ramp
He wears the same flightsuit as The Pilot but the insignia
identifies him as a higher rank This is THE CAPTAIN We
recognize him as one of the astronauts from the blood-stained
photograph His cold shark eyes survey the empty field

The Captain pulls something from his pocket It looks like an
iPhone We already know its not The device BEEPS
RHYTHMICALLY The Captain follows its signal

ACROSS THE FIELD a PARK RANGER SUV pulls up and a RANGER

climbs out -- staring up in awe at the star capsule towering
over him He spots The Captain -- runs to intercept --
RANGER

Uh excuse me Sir Parks closed

Anyway you cant leave your uh
(squints at the ship)

- what is that

Without even looking up The Captain DISCHARGES a PULSE OF
SOUND WAVES from his device (a bloomer) -- sending the Ranger
SPRAWLING BACK into an unconscious heap

The Captain resumes his search His device beeps FASTER
until he finds himself standing over a BLINKING TRANSPONDER
landed in the periphery of the field

The Captain picks up the transponder Stiffs a smile Then
CRUSHES it in his hand until it stops blinking He stalks
off muttering under his breath --

THE CAPTAIN
Lucky break kid you only get
one of those
MOMENTS LATER an OFF-SCREEN BLAST --
The Ranger jolts to his feet in time to see the star capsule
taking off rising into the sky before CAMOUFLAGING with the
starfield beyond and VANISHING COMPLETELY

The Ranger falls to his knees and faints

EXT SKY OVER MICHIGAN - NIGHT

The Captain pilots his capsule into position high over the
GLITTERING LIGHTS of the world below With the rest of the
ship camouflaged he appears to be FLOATING -- until --

THE CAPTAIN
Computer Lets begin

COMPUTER VOICE
Initiating surveillance

DATA APPEARS swirling around The Captain An ERUPTION OF
SOUND as the capsule monitors COUNTLESS TRANSMISSIONS and
CELLPHONE SIGNALS its a BLUR of NOISE but The Captain is
able to parse it effortlessly resting back as if he were
listening to classical music

THE CAPTAIN
I know youre out there

The noise builds to a CRESCENDO as we CUT TO --

EXT WOODS - DAY

The next day The Pilot works on the ship sorting through a
mess of tangled wiring Adam serves as The Pilots helper
handing off tools trying not to get underfoot

ADAM
So youre saying there are others
like you Other astronauts

THE PILOT
Not many Six in all The program
was extremely selective Even where
Im from no one knows we exist
ADAM
Why not

As he works The Pilot activates the ships MEMORY BANK and
HOLOGRAPHIC RECORDINGS of PAST VOYAGES explode all around

him Adam staggers back as STARS and NEBULAE swirl past -- a

tour of the cosmos in the middle of the Michigan wilderness

The Pilot smiles Even now it takes his breath away

THE PILOT

Since the 1960s interstellar
travel has been the governments
game Arnand Zucker changed all
that A self-made man -- an
entrepreneur -- and incidentally
one of the richest men on the
planet At least he was until he
sunk his fortune into the first
private sector space program

(beat)
It was a total accident the first
time we did it

ADAM
Did what

THE PILOT
Broke the speed of light

Suddenly the holographic view of the cosmos CONTORTS into a
We witness the rush of FASTER THAN LIGHT SPEED

WORMHOLE

THE PILOT
Celium made it all possible And
the faster we flew the further
back we went First just a few
seconds then a day then a
week then a year Nothing could
stop us The final barrier to mans
dominion over space and time had
fallen But if the government found
out what wed done they wouldve
shut us down in a heartbeat So we
kept it a secret We all agreed
the power was too great to share
with the world Turns out it was
too great for us too The program
took a turn Zucker changed

ADAM
And thats why youre here Thats
your mission Youre trying to stop
time travel from being invented

The Pilot doesnt deny it He looks up at the capsule with a
mixture of awe and contempt

THE PILOT
God willing youll grow up ina
future in which this machine never
exists

Holographic images FADE returning the woods to their
original state The Pilot goes back to work as Adam is hit
with a sudden thought --

ADAM
What about the other pilots Arent
they gonna come looking for you

A beat -- just a hint of emotion --

THE PILOT
Not all of them
(then cutting off
questions)
Hand me that torque wrench

Adam obliges As he does we WIDEN to REVEAL -- TOMMY Spying
from the cover of heavy woods No way of knowing how long
hes been there or how much he overheard

CUT TO

INT ARCHER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

That night Adam and Tommy sit opposite The Pilot and Bonnie
at the cramped dinner table Bosco is affectionately licking
The Pilots palms nuzzling against his leg

BONNIE
Thats amazing he never takes
to strangers like that

The Pilot quickly stands trying to shake off the beast

THE PILOT
Anyone need a re-fill

BONNIE
You know why not Special
occasion The glasses are in the --

But The Pilot is already pulling a glass form the appropriate
cupboard

THE PILOT
-- lucky guess

Adam frowns hes heard that exact excuse before The Pilot
returns to his seat surreptitiously kicking Bosco away but
the dogs not budging Finally Tommy makes his move --

TOMMY
So Hows your science fair project

coming

ADAM
Since when do you care

TOMMY
Since I saw it Today In the
woods

CLANK Adam drops his fork

TOMMY
I have to admit Im impressed Did
you build that all on your own

BONNIE
Build what

ADAM
Its a a uh --

THE PILOT
Its a spaceship

Adam shoots The Pilot a look What are you doing

BONNIE
A spaceship Really

THE PILOT
Just a model of course A
prototype of what I think space
travel will look like in the
future Kind of a hobby of mine
Adams been helping me out

ADAM
Yeah but I mean it doesnt fly or
anything
Adam LAUGHS as if that were ridiculous then keeps

laughing overselling it The Pilot quietly kicks him

BONNIE
(indicates Tommy)
Well you should definitely talk to

this one
(MORE )

BONNIE (CONTD)
I thought it was just a phase you
know all kids want to be
astronauts when they grow up but
were still waiting for him to grow
out of it

TOMMY
Mom â€”--

BONNIE
What Dont be shy
(to The Pilot beaming)
Hes already been accepted to
Caltech Full scholarship

TOMMY
I havent decided if Im going yet

THE PILOT
You will
(off Tommys look)
Trust me I have kind of a knack
about these things

Across the table Adam looks from The Pilot to Tommy the
resemblance is becoming harder to deny with every moment

INT KITCHEN - LATER

Bonnie washes dishes over the sink The Pilot is on drying
duty THROUGH THE DOORWAY Adam discreetly listens in

BONNIE
I want to thank you for taking an
interest in Adam He tries hard
but sometimes he just needs a
little extra push Id do it
myself but there arent always
enough hours in the day

THE PILOT
You do enough

BONNIE
-- yeah How would you know You
just met me

THE PILOT
I hear it from Adam In fact just
the other day he was telling me
how much he appreciates everything
you do

BONNIE

Adam said that Not a chance
THE PILOT

He talks about you a lot actually
BONNIE

(beat)

What else does he say
THE PILOT

He says it couldnt have been

easy for you To raise two kids all
on your own To lose your husband
so young He says he understands

BONNIE
Understands

THE PILOT
Why you push him so hard He says
he doesnt want to let you down

Bonnie is moved almost to tears but she plays it off with a
shrug forcing herself to focus on the dishes

BONNIE
That doesnt sound like Adam

ON ADAM reacting it sure doesnt The Pilot resumes drying

THE PILOT
Sometimes kids have a hard time
saying what they really mean Until
its too late

Bonnie finds herself staring at The Pilot He catches her eye
and she looks away embarrassed

BONNIE
Sorry you suddenly just seemed
so familiar to me

THE PILOT
One of those faces I guess

Bonnies hand comes down accidentally brushing against The
Pilots and it lingers Instantly The Pilot JERKS AWAY

THE PILOT
Uh you know damn look at the
time I should go

BONNIE
You sure Desserts in the oven My
world famous cobbler

THE PILOT
No yeah I forgot Im late fora
thing But thank you For dinner
And uh you know I meant
it What I said See ya

The Pilot trips over his own two feet stumbling on his way
out the door leaving Bonnie dumbstruck She turns back to
the dishes with an inward sigh --

BONNIE
World famous cobbler who are
you kidding

CLOSE ON ADAM staring after The Pilot the beginnings of
an idea starting to take hold

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

A FLASHLIGHT BEAM cuts through darkness as Adam steps through
the woods Suddenly --

KONK He finds the star capsule the same way he did before
and falls flat on his ass

MOMENTS LATER Adam feels around the shell of the invisible
ship looking for a way in Suddenly BLUE LIGHT fills the
air piercing the evening mist Adams hand is SCANNED

COMPUTER VOICE
Welcome Adam Archer

Adam frowns --

ADAM
It knows me

The capsule UNCLOAKS and the doorway OPENS Adam checks
around -- no sign of The Pilot He steps inside

INT STAR CAPSULE - NIGHT

Lights FLICKER ON revealing the central command console -- a
complicated array of levers and switches

Adam sits in the pilots chair which immediately CONTORTS to
fit his shape A JOYSTICK is thrust into his grasp like the
control mechanism for a fighter jet

ADAM
Wow
A RED BUTTON is perched on the stick It has all the tempting
appeal of any red button to a curious 12-year-old mind

so naturally Adam PUSHES IT --

The capsule ROARS TO LIFE the HUM of machinery building to a
HIGH WHINE

A SIGNAL IS TRANSMITTED and we FOLLOW IT out of the ship
into the sky through clouds until we arrive at --

EXT SKY OVER MICHIGAN - NIGHT

The Captain sits in a meditative pose amid his cocoon of
data The signal reaches his vessel His eyes SNAP OPEN

THE CAPTAIN
Got you

The capsule UNCLOAKS materializing around The Captain as he
RACES OFF zeroing in on his target

INT STAR CAPSULEEXT WOODS - NIGHT

The viewscreen comes alive with DATA and MEASUREMENTS
contour lines SCANNING and MAPPING the heavens above

Adam TOUCHES one of the stars and our view ZOOMS IN mapping
the constellation in incredible three-dimensional detail The
lights of the cosmos SPARKLE in Adams eyes until --

THE PILOT
What the hell are you doing

The Pilot drags Adam backwards out of the ship

ADAM
Hey Get off

Once clear The Pilot uses his handheld device to deactivate
the capsule He scans the skies genuinely worried

THE PILOT
I told you not to touch anything

ADAM
I was only looking for

He trails off The Pilot turns

THE PILOT
What

ADAM

-- proof

(off The Pilots look)
The first time you saw me you
recognized me And -- and you knew
my name before I told you and the
combination to the shed and Bosco
actually likes you and -- admit
it

In The Pilots eyes resignation Hes busted Adam has never
been more sure of anything He nods

ADAM
Youre Tommy

A beat then The Pilot BURSTS OUT LAUGHING

THE PILOT
Tommy You think Im Tommy

ADAM
es arent you

THE PILOT
No Adam God Im you

This sinks in Adam stares at The Pilot Shakes his head

ADAM
No way

THE PILOT
All right You broke your arm on
Brad Waldens trampoline when you
were six years old When the doctor
set your arm it left a scar

ADAM
How did you --

The Pilot rolls up his sleeve revealing a LIGHT SCAR on his
right arm -- a slightly peculiar CURVED SHAPE

Adam rolls up his own sleeve While his younger scar is
slightly more prominent its the EXACT SAME SHAPE

A surreal universe-bending moment Adam staggers back The
Pilot is about to explain further when a LOW BEEPING catches
his attention He moves to the star capsule peers inside --

The main viewscreen FLASHES a warning INCOMING FIRE
DETECTED

Before The Pilot can react a PULSE descends from above and
the capsule EXPLODES in a BALL OF FIRE throwing the Adams
back off their feet

IN THE SKY The Captains star capsule has arrived already
circling around for another shot

The Pilot recovers from the blast He takes in the WRECKAGE
of his ship devastated Suddenly Adam starts RUNNING back
in the direction of his house The Pilot gives chase

ADAM
Help Mom Tommy HELP

THE PILOT
Adam Get back here We have to
leave them out of this

ADAM
Leave ME out of this

THE PILOT
Its too late for that

The Pilot TACKLES Adam They wrestle around Adam FLAILS and
PUNCHES and KICKS and SCREAMS

THE PILOT
Youre only hurting yourself

The Captain broadcasts overhead --

THE CAPTAIN (0C)
That was your only warning Adam
Give up now and therell be no
need to involve the kid further

Adam breaks from The Pilot starts waving his arms in the
air

ADAM
We surrender We surrender

The Pilot pulls Adam hard into the woods
THE PILOT
Jesus cut it out Youre

embarrassing yourself

ADAM
But hes only after you

THE PILOT
You are me He can take out either
one of us and still get what he
wants And no offense but youre a
hell of an easier target

ADAM
So what are we gonna do

THE PILOT
Relax I have a plan

The Pilot pinches a pressure point on Adams neck -- the kid
instantly falls unconscious

IN THE CAPSULE The Captains radar detects TWO TARGETS --
one moving one not He pursues the target that isnt moving

ON THE PILOT running for all hes worth He slides down into
a CRATER landing amid the SCORCHED WRECKAGE of his star
capsule In the debris he finds what hes looking for --

The celium core Glowing and intact He takes it and RUNS --

IN THE CAPSULE The Captain flies low to the ground The
console maps the woods before him -- too thick to penetrate

He FIRES a PULSE of SOUND WAVES --
Trees BEND and SNAP clearing a path WIDEN to REVEAL --

Adam Still unconscious as the capsule bears down on his
position The Pilot is using his younger self as bait

ON THE PILOT pitching through heavy woods desperately
trying to activate his handheld device It must have been
damaged in the blast

IN THE CAPSULE The Captain closes in radar locked ready to
fire when he sees -- ADAM lying helpless before him

ON THE CAPTAIN the faintest hint of RECOGNITION

Suddenly The Pilot appears throwing himself between Adam
and the ship He MEETS EYES with The Captain through the
cockpit window as his Athens device POWERS UP UNFOLDING into
a HANDHELD WEAPON He raises the blaster --

THE PILOT AND THE CAPTAIN FIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY The blasts
COLLIDE in a SHOCK WAVE that sweeps The Pilot off his feet

IN THE CAPSULE The Captain struggles to regain control of
his ship circling around lining up another shot

ON THE PILOT recovering He searches the area and finds his
blaster -- landed in the branches of a tree high above

The Pilot RACES FORWARD and PARKOURS UP THE TREE Adam comes
to just in time to see this amazed look at me go

ON THE PILOT reaching the top He grabs for the blaster but
it FALLS FROM HIS GRASP clattering down the branches Damn

The Captain FIRES No time to think The Pilot LEAPS from the
tree using the branches the way a gymnast would use the
uneven bars The tree EXPLODES above him erupting in flames--

-- as The Pilot lands on his back blaster now in hand He
aims up at the capsule as it passes overhead -- FIRES --

A direct hit The pulse SLAMS INTO THE CAPSULE and the ship
SPINS off course slicing across treetops

ON ADAM climbing to his feet completely unaware of the
MASSIVE SHIP hurdling towards him The Pilot sees whats
happening --

THE PILOT
ADAM DOWN

Finally Adam sees the ship coming He stands there frozen
too scared to do much of anything else

From The Pilots POV the ship CRASHES and Adam is LOST in a
CLOUD OF DEBRIS

Panicked The Pilot runs for the wreckage but just as he
approaches the capsule ZAPS OFF into the sky at near the
speed of light Gone Retreated For now

Dust clears and we find ADAM lying on his back near the
crash site The Pilot crouches over him --

THE PILOT
Adam Are you all right Can you
hear me

Adam comes to His hand instinctively goes to a SHRAPNEL
WOUND on his neck and comes back bloody He gasps --

ADAM
Im bleeding Im bleeding

The Pilot inspects the cut -- nothing serious

THE PILOT
I think well live

Adam fumbles for his inhaler The Pilot frowns -- sensing
something His hand goes to his own neck where the EXACT
SAME SCAR has formed A look of realization -- figuring out
the rules -- as Adam takes a DEEP HIT off his inhaler

ADAM
Am I gonna die

The Pilot snaps to attention

THE PILOT
No youre not gonna die Youre a
soldier now and Im your
commanding officer That means you
do exactly what I say when I say
it and you live Understand

A beat Adam nods

ADAM
Yes sir

THE PILOT
Good And right now
(he thinks nods)
We need to run
The Pilot takes Adams hand and HAULS him off into the woods

EXT SUMMIT - NIGHT

The star capsule has landed on an isolated summit damaged
from the fight on its last legs The Captain deploys a
BEACON which SHOOTS UP into the sky A moment passes

Suddenly the sky above CONTORTS A WORMHOLE OPENS and
ANOTHER STAR CAPSULE APPEARS coming in for a landing beside
The Captains busted vessel The door opens --

THREE ASTRONAUTS step out wearing matching flightsuits each
of them recognizable from the blood-stained photograph

JASPER is bulky and tough LAURA is steely and focused DASH
is the youngest He greets The Captain with a smile --

DASH
Hiya Cap Little engine trouble

THE CAPTAIN
Shut up Dash

The Captain pushes past into the newly arrived capsule The
astronauts exchange nervous glances -- not the greeting they
were expecting

IN THE CAPSULE The Captain arms himself from a RACK of
FUTURISTIC GEAR We catch glimpses of devices to be employed
later -- bloomers stilt runners plasma gloves etc

LAURA
Wheres Adam

The Captains eyes say it all Jasper reads him

JASPER
-- he got away Jesus howd you
let that happen

LAURA
Take it easy Jasper Everyone
makes mistakes Hes only human

The Captain seems almost offended by that He pulls ona
THICK GLOVE laced with electric circuitry

JASPER
You should know Cap the others
are starting to talk Boss is
worried you might not be up for
this job

THE CAPTAIN
Im handling it arent I

JASPER
I dont know Are you

THE CAPTAIN
Adams on foot with a small kid in
tow he couldnt have gotten far I
just need more time

JASPER
Times the one thing we dont have
Im sure I dont have to remind you
whats at stake here

The Captains glove CRACKLES with power Jasper backs off

THE CAPTAIN
No You dont

The Captain stalks past Jasper out of the capsule

THE CAPTAIN
I have the situation under control
Ill find Adam Ill bring him in
Alive

LAURA
And if you cant

THE CAPTAIN
(beat he nods)
Then Ill handle him myself

As if to illustrate the point The Captain FIRES the glove a
BOLT ERUPTS from his palm and RIPS a TOWERING SYCAMORE to
splinters Jasper and Laura are impressed Dash intervenes --
DASH

I dont mean to be a buzzkill but

-- does anyone even know where

Adams going
Off The Captains reaction -- working it through He nods --

THE CAPTAIN
We have work to do

CUT TO

EXT ABANDONED ROAD - NIGHT

Adam and The Pilot hitchhike along a deserted road The Pilot
is using his Athens device as a compass Adam trails behind
struggling to keep up puffing on his inhaler

THE PILOT
Well keep off the main roads -- no
airports no public transportation

ADAM
Can you slow down

THE PILOT
Ill get you back to our Mom as
soon as this is over Until then
we have to stick together

ADAM
Seriously I cant breathe

THE PILOT
Yes you can

Adam goes to take another hit when he TRIPS and TUMBLES down
an embankment He looks up GASPS

ADAM
My inhaler

Its gone Adam frantically paws at the earth until he finds
himself at The Pilots feet He looks up The Pilot is
holding the inhaler Adam is relieved but The Pilot promptly
HURLS the inhaler deep into the woods

THE PILOT
There Now breathe

Adam stares at The Pilot in utter shock then starts to
HYPERVENTILATE panicking beyond reason

ADAM
I cant -- I cant Im gonna die

THE PILOT
Youre not gonna die

ADAM
I cant breathe My lungs are
collapsing Youre trying to kill
me

The Pilot grips Adams shoulders forcing eye contact

THE PILOT
Adam Look at me Look at me

Adam focuses on his older self The Pilot speaks calmly --

THE PILOT
You can breathe

The Pilot inhales deep demonstrating Adam does the same
The Pilot exhales slowly Again Adam does the same

ADAM
I can breathe

The Pilot nods Adam smiles -- breathing regularly now He
ERUPTS in ECSTATIC CELEBRATION

ADAM
I CAN BREATHE

THE PILOT
Congratulations

The Pilot resumes walking down the road Adam follows --
keeping up effortlessly now --

THE PILOT
You can breathe you can run you
can jump you can swim

(MORE)

THE PILOT (CONTD)
You can do just about anything a
normal kid can do and then some
Just stop eating peanuts Mild
allergy Very common

ADAM
Really Thats it

THE PILOT
Thats it You wouldve found out
for yourself soon enough but we
dont have that kind of time We
have a long road ahead of us

ADAM
You still havent told me where
were going

THE PILOT
Thats classified

Adam pulls up short

ADAM
- Still

The Pilot doesnt break his stride hes obviously not
joking Adam rolls his eyes and follows muttering under his
breath unbelievable

EXT ARCHER RESIDENCE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

The doorbell RINGS From inside we hear FAST-APPROACHING
FOOTSTEPS The door SWINGS OPEN -- Bonnie is a nervous wreck
surprised to find police officers crowding her doorstep --

The Captain Jasper Laura and Dash all dressed as cops
Jasper takes point --

JASPER
Good morning maam You filed a
missing persons report

BONNIE
I tried the woman on the phone
said to call back after itd been
twenty-four hours

JASPER
That would be Cheryl We apologize
for her May we come in

off Bonnies scrutinizing reaction

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

PHOTOS have been splayed across the coffee table pictures of
Adam yanked from their frames Empty frames everywhere

JASPER
- and thats the last time you
saw your son He hasnt called or
tried to make contact

Bonnie is distracted trying to get a look at The Captain
who keeps to the rear of the group back turned

BONNIE
Uh no he hasnt Ive been
trying to think of who he might be
with but Adam never really had a
lot of friends
(she trails off)
This just isnt like him

Laura displays a photo of The Pilot

LAURA
Do you recognize this man

Bonnie looks at the picture and goes TOTALLY STILL

BONNIE
Well yeah thats Adams tutor Why
do you have his picture

JASPER
This man was seen crossing state
lines earlier today with a boy
matching Adams description We
have reason to believe he may have
kidnapped your son

BONNIE
No thats -- thats impossible he
was just here I made him dinner
he was he

Tears spring to Bonnies eyes the gravity of the situation
finally sinking in She covers her face

BONNIE
Oh my God oh God how could I
be so stupid

ON THE CAPTAIN softening somewhat at the sight of Bonnie
breaking down He steps forward and lays a hand on her arm

A cautious glance from the officers -- The Captain is
clearly breaking protocol Bonnie finds herself staring at
him -- a moment of connection -- almost recognition

BONNIE
Im sorry What did you say your
name was

THE CAPTAIN
- Evans

Bonnie shakes her head it doesnt ring a bell

BONNIE
I must be losing my mind

THE CAPTAIN
No youre not Youre just under a
lot of stress Try not to worry
(a salesman smile)
Were the good guys

Bonnie looks into this strangers eyes and calms somewhat
finding something there she can trust

EXT ROAD - DAY
Adam and The Pilot are on foot cresting a hill that
overlooks a SMALL TOWN in the rural mid-west Farmland

stretches as far as the eye can see

INT CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

Adam wanders the aisles filling a basket with Red Bull and
candy bars OUTSIDE The Pilot is seen conversing with a
MEXICAN FAMILY in what we can only assume is PERFECT SPANISH

Adam lays the goods on the counter He notices a LAND LINE --
whispers to the clerk conspiratorial --

ADAM
Can I use your phone

INT ARCHER RESIDENCE - TOMMYS BEDROOM - DAY

A cell-phone VIBRATES -- picked up by Tommy --

TOMMY

of the Mexican patriarch theyre laughing like

MR RAMIREZ

Adam catches The Pilots look play along He shrugs --

ADAM

They start to leave when the clerk intervenes --

Busted Adam meets his older selfs accusing stare

INT ARCHER RESIDENCE - FOYER â€”- DAY

The Captain and his team are half out the door Bonnie
feeding them pictures as they go --

BONNIE

search --

LAURA
No maam thank you we have

TOMMY (0OC)

Tommy comes bounding into the room He pulls up short
locking eyes with The Captain for a moment forgetting
what he came in to say
BONNIE
Tommy this is Officer Evans Hes
in charge of finding your brother

The Captain extends a hand

THE CAPTAIN
Nice to meet you Son

Reluctantly Tommy shakes the mans hand Some kind of charge
between them He shakes it off comes to his senses

TOMMY
I know where Adam is

EXT CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

The Pilot stalks away from the store Adam trailing behind

THE PILOT
I said no phone calls didnt I
Come to think of it Im pretty
sure I made that very clear

ADAM
I know but -- I dont see what the
big deal is Its just Tommy

THE PILOT
Oh sure its just Tommy Except
who the hell do you think is --

He catches himself before he says too much Adam frowns

ADAM
Who do I think is what

High above a LOUD POP as the SOUND BARRIER IS BROKEN A
collective gasp from the sparse crowd of pedestrians -- heads
tilted back camera phones aimed to the sky but theres
nothing to see no trace of whatever caused the sound

Only The Pilot knows He drags Adam off towards the pickup

THE PILOT
This is why we dont make phone
calls

INT STAR CAPSULE - DAY

The console scans the crowd below automatically focusing in
on THE PILOT bartering with Mr Ramirez

THE PILOT
Lo siento Senor pero mi hijo y
tengo que pedir prestado el camion

LAURA
Target acquired

DASH
(hopeful)
Break out the stilts

THE CAPTAIN
Not yet Get us in range I want to
talk to him

JASPER
-- talk Due respect sir but I
think the time for diplomacy is
over

A beat The Captain nods sure of himself

THE CAPTAIN
I want to talk to him

EXT CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

Mr Ramirez is shocked at the WAD OF CASH The Pilot has just
piled into his hands

MR RAMIREZ
Are you sure Senor This is more
than twenty thousand dollars

THE PILOT
Yeah well its worth a lot less
where I come from
(to Adam)
Get in

MOMENTS LATER the Adams PEEL OUT of the lot leaving the
Ramirez family behind Amazed at their good fortune

EXT FREEWAY â€” DAY

The Pilot drives pushing the truck to capacity weaving
through heavy midday traffic

ADAM
Are you mad

THE PILOT
With you No Im thrilled

Suddenly The Pilots Athens device VIBRATES like a
cellphone Adam covers his ears against the noise

The sound takes on shape and texture until a VOICE emerges
from the device -- THE CAPTAIN -- as if hes sitting right
next to us INTERCUT between the pickup and the camouflaged
star capsule hovering just overhead

THE CAPTAIN
Pull over Adam No need for this
to get out of hand

THE PILOT
Is that you Cap

THE CAPTAIN
Listen We can do this the easy way
or the hard way but no matter
what Im taking you home

A beat as The Pilot considers shakes his head --
THE PILOT
Youre gonna have to catch me
first

THE CAPTAIN
(sighs)
Have it your way Kickstand

Adams head is spinning but that last part registered loud
and clear

ADAM
Â« TOMMY

The Pilot reaches out and TIGHTENS Adams seatbelt before
VEERING sharply across the meridian into the opposing lane
of traffic Cars swerve and honk

IN THE CAPSULE The Captain (who we now know is TOMMY age
46) turns to the others -- nods --

THE CAPTAIN
Take him down

JASPER
Now youre talking Break out the
stilts Dash

Dash pumps his fist yesss moves for the back of the ship

FOLLOWING THE TRUCK weaving through SCREAMING TRAFFIC as the
air above the road starts to SHIMMER The star capsule
UNCLOAKS directly overhead A hatch SLIDES OPEN --

Dash drops to the road below wearing a pair of CURVED
FIBERGLASS APPENDAGES that absorb the impact As soon as hes
clear the ship RESUMES CAMOUFLAGE and DISAPPEARS

Dash LUNGES after the pickup FASTER than the surrounding
traffic sprinting on the stilts like a gazelle

IN THE PICKUP Adam sees Dash coming

ADAM
Holy shit

THE PILOT
Stilt runners Cool huh
(regretting it now)
I helped design them

ON DASH closing the gap He pulls on a PLASMA GLOVE The
circuitry CRACKLES and SPARKS juicing up until -- BAM A
BOLT emanates from the glove RIPPING INTO THE PAVEMENT

THE PILOT
Thats enough Tommy Someones
gonna get hurt

THE CAPTAIN
Little late for that isnt it

THE PILOT
You know that wasnt me You know I
didnt kill JR

Adam glances to the blood-stained photograph SIX ASTRONAUTS
are featured -- including one woman we havent met yet

The picture is starting to comes into focus

ON DASH running alongside the pickup without even breaking a
sweat He FIRES his plasma glove --

-- just as The Pilot SLAMS on the brakes The blast MISSES
taking out the FRONT TIRES of a BIG RIG which SKIDS OUT
across the freeway

Adam CLINGS TO THE DOOR and SCREAMS as The Pilot pulls the
wheel hard over executing a perfect three hundred and sixty-
degree spin -- skirting the perimeter of the pile-up

The Pilot clears the damage area -- a CATACLYSMIC WRECK
filling his rearview He accelerates off-road through the
guardrail heading for a DISTANT CORNFIELD

Dash leaps over fishtailing cars like an Olympic runner
clearing hurdles pursuing the Adams into the field

EXT CORNFIELD - DAY

The Pilot DRIVES flattening stalks of corn that obscure his
vision The conversation continues --

THE CAPTAIN
Im sorry Adam Im just not buying
it If you didnt do anything
wrong then whyd you run

The Pilot hesitates before answering
THE PILOT
Because there wasnt anyone
left in the program I could trust

This sinks in

EXPLOSIONS blow CRATERS in the field One gets too close
IONIZED GAS SHREDS the pickups tired like MOLTEN LAVA

THE PILOT
Take the wheel

No time to explain The Pilots already climbing out of the
truck

ADAM
I DONT EVEN HAVE A LEARNERS
PERMIT

The Pilot climbs along the outside of the truck onto the
flatbed Stalks of corn WHIP OUT at him as he aims his
blaster through the field counting down Dashs time between
jumps He FIRES --

Direct hit Dash is BLOWN BACK -- alive but out of the game
ABOVE the star capsule UNCLOAKS -- long enough for JASPER to
drop out on his own pair of stilts The Pilot takes advantage
-- aims up --

THE PILOT

Sorry Tommy

He FIRES The blast SLAMS into the ship knocking it off
course IN THE COCKPIT Laura fights with the controls

LAURA
Dammit He took out our flight
systems Were going down

The Captain SLAMS his device breaking the connection

JASPER (0C)
Dont worry Cap Im on it

ON JASPER leaping through the field like Superman

THE CAPTAIN
Jasper Remember were taking him
alive Him and the boy

Jasper pretends not to hear focused on the chase AHEAD
corn stalks BEND indicating the pickups position

IN THE TRUCK The Pilot takes the wheel shoving Adam aside --

ADAM
What happened You didnt hurt
Tommy did you

The Pilot gives Adam a sideways glance youre worried about
him Before he can answer MORE PLASMA BOLTS MORE
EXPLOSIONS dangerously close The doors are BLOWN AWAY The
Pilot checks his mirror -- Jasper gains at a FULL SPRINT

THE PILOT
Sorry kid Looks like youre gonna
have to jump

ADAM
Dont call me -- wait I have to
WHAT

THE PILOT
Duck and roll Easy peasy

The Pilot KICKS Adam out of the truck OUTSIDE Adam ducks
and rolls the corn stalks softening his fall Kind of

ON THE PILOT driving coming up on the end of the field
BEHIND HIM Jasper reaches top speed and LEAPS --

-- sailing CLEAR OVER THE TRUCK --

-- and landing in The Pilots path He TURNS and FIRES --

BOOM The pickup TILTS END-OVER-END tumbling over Jaspers
head coming to a stop several feet away

Debris settles Jaspers stilts FOLD IN AUTOMATICALLY as he
calmly approaches the mangled remains of the pickup

The Pilot staggers from the wreckage dizzy but ready to
fight A SINGLE TOUCH from Jaspers glove sends him FLYING
BACK Out cold

JASPER
I wont lie Adam Ive wanted to
do that for a long time
(he aims the glove)
This is for JR

Before Jasper can fire a SHOCKWAVE intervenes dropping him
like a sack of potatoes REVEAL -- The Captain stands behind
him -- the source of the blast He looms over The Pilot
for the first time the nickname sounds almost endearing --

THE CAPTAIN
Sorry Kickstand No more running

FURTHER BACK we hear the sound of the plasma glove CHARGING
UP The Captain turns -- ADAM is now wearing Jaspers glove

ADAM
Dont call me that

Adam FIRES and The Captain goes FLYING BACK unconscious

The Pilot finally comes to -- The Captain and Jasper splayed
out before him Adam stands triumphantly over them

THE PILOT
Did did you do that

Adam shrugs I guess I did No time to celebrate though
sounds of pursuit near Adam and The Pilot RUN through the
field As they do we RISE UP to REVEAL --

A train pulling out of a train yard in the distance

INT RATL CAR â€” DAY

The Pilot helps Adam into the moving train before hauling
himself aboard He instantly COLLAPSES wounded exhausted

Adam steps close as if he means to help but grabs The
Pilots Athens device and LEAPS BACK The device UNFOLDS into
BLASTER MODE This time Adam knows how to use it

ADAM
Start talking

THE PILOT
Adam what the hell are you --

Adam FIRES blowing the train door off its hinges

THE PILOT
Jesus

ADAM
Tell me the truth Whys Tommy
trying to kill us
(beat he swallows)
Am I a murderer

THE PILOT
Adam no Of course not think
about what youre saying You know
me

ADAM
No I dont I dont know anything
about you Its all CLASSIFIED

A long beat Adam has a point The Pilot rests against the
wall of the rail car too exhausted to keep fighting

THE PILOT
You really want to know

Adam nods The Pilot manages a weary smile

THE PILOT
You asked for it

INT RAIL CAR - SUNSET

The train cuts across the horizon touring the countryside
Adam and The Pilot sit legs dangling over the edge where
the door used to be

THE PILOT
I remember when I was your age all
I wanted was to be a world champion
snowboarder like Shaun White
There was this one trail I was
obsessed with

ADAM
The Streif

The Pilot nods thats the one

ADAM
So what happened
(off look)
We dont even like to fly

THE PILOT
Things change One day about ten
years from now Tommy shows up at
your door out of the blue Hes not
alone Arnand Zucker is with him

FLASH The Pilot SHAKES HANDS with Zucker Good firm grip

THE PILOT
He says he wants Tommy to join some
sort of experimental space program
Tommys the golden boy none of
its possible without him but
he wont go without you

ADAM
And Tommy gets what Tommy wants

Adam produces the group photo He indicates the UNIDENTIFIED
WOMAN

ADAM
What about her

THE PILOT
Jimmy Ryan JR for short Zucker
recruited her from basic training
at the Air Force The first time
you set eyes on her its like

FLASH JRs face for just a blink and then shes gone

The Pilot falls silent at the memory Words fail him

ADAM
Qross

THE PILOT
Youll understand one day

ADAM
Did you ever tell her how you feel
I mean do I

A beat The Pilot shakes his head no

THE PILOT
It was never part of the plan

ADAM
figures

The Pilot takes the photograph and stares down at JR
Haunted heartbroken Re-living the memory

THE PILOT
One night she calls you up and
says she needs to tell you
something Something she cant tell
anyone else Not even Tommy

FLASH Were inside an apartment -- signs of a struggle
furniture tossed around Blood-stained photos protrude from
cracked frames The Pilot crouches over JR as she WHISPERS

THE PILOT
She found out that Zucker was going
into the past for personal gain --
expanding his empire building his
fortune She confronted him
said it was time to take the

program public

ADAM
so he killed her

FLASH JR dies in The Pilots arms He holds her close
THE PILOT
I couldnt save her

Adam catches the slip I instead of â€˜youâ€™ The Pilot forges

on --

THE PILOT
You know its only a matter of time
before they come after you So you
do what you always do

ADAM
(nods not surprised)
I run away

FLASH The Pilot takes the bloody photograph from its frame
He RUNS out the back as POLICE LIGHTS arrive at the front

THE PILOT
But you have a plan You know its
not enough to just go back and save
JR thats not what she wouldve
wanted anyway You have to end the
program You have to end it from
the beginning

ADAM
- then what happens to you

THE PILOT
I dont know Im as new at this as
you are My guess is I cease to
exist My future will be in your
hands Try not to screw it up

A beat Adam feels the weight of responsibility

ADAM
How do we stop the program

The Pilots device displays an old NEWSPAPER CLIPPING The
headline reads NOBEL LAUREATE KILLED IN FATAL CRASH Below
a picture of a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

THE PILOT
Dr Marie Gordon Zuckers partner
in the early days of the program
She was the first person to predict
the applications of celium If we
can convince her to abandon her
research we can kill Zuckers
dream in the crib before it ruins a
single life

ADAM
(on the article)
This says Marie Gordon died in a
car crash more than ten years ago

THE PILOT
July 2 2000 Thats how far back
we have to go Which is why I was
trying to repair my ship

ADAM
Your ship was destroyed

THE PILOT
Thanks I noticed

ADAM
So what are we doing now

THE PILOT
Now were finding another one

This sinks in

ADAM
Oh Well thats not too hard We
just have to invent time travel
Decades before anyone else

A long pause as the Adams take in the task before them Adam
has one last question but hes almost afraid to ask

ADAM
Do we ever ride the Streif

The Pilot wants to lie but cant Adam reads the truth in
his eyes obviously not finding the answer he was looking

for The Pilot puts a consoling hand on his shoulder as the
train rides on

CUT TO

INT STAR CAPSULE - NIGHT

The Captain mans the console studying a map of Adams
trajectory -- a ROLLING INDEX of possible destinations One
in particular catches his eye GRAND LAKE COLORADO

Suddenly a PRESENCE from behind He speaks without turning --

THE CAPTAIN
Hows the arm Jasper

REVEAL -- the astronauts are all VISIBLY INJURED from the
previous altercation Dash has a black eye Lauras face is
bruised Jasper got the worst of it his arm is in a sling

JASPER
Fine sir While were on the
subject would you care to explain
why you shot me

THE CAPTAIN
You know why Our mission hasnt
changed

JASPER
Our mission is bigger than Adam
and you know it

THE CAPTAIN
Are you here to doubt my resolve
or do you actually have something
useful to report

LAURA
Actually sir Dash had an idea A
solution we might have overlooked

Finally The Captain turns -- focused on Dash --

DASH
Well yeah I mean the cores
back online right All systems are
go so why dont we just go back
further To like before Adam
became such a problem

THE CAPTAIN
And do what exactly

Dash doesnt have the heart to say it but Jasper does

JASPER
Neutralize him sir Take him out
before he lives to a be a threat to
the program the team and
everything weve fought for

The Captain nods as if that makes perfect sense then he
LUNGES for Jasper SLAMS him hard against the cockpit wall

LAURA
Captain stop --

THE CAPTAIN
Are you out of your mind Were
here to minimize ripples and you
want to kill him

JASPER
How do you know hes not planning
to do the same thing to us

The Captain blinks he hadnt considered that He releases
Jasper Shakes his head

THE CAPTAIN
No Adam wouldnt do that

JASPER
The same way he wouldnt kill JR
Or confiscate one of the old mans
ships

LAURA
Jasper has a point After all this
we still dont even know what
Adams trying to do

THE CAPTAIN
Theres nothing he can do Not
here To affect real damage to the
program hed have to get back at
least another ten years And
without a ship

The Captain trails off as realization touches his eyes He
SPINS to the console -- still displaying a map of Grand Lake

THE CAPTAIN
Lock these coordinates and fire up
the grid for re-entry

LAURA
- Sir

THE CAPTAIN
I know where Adams going MOVE

The astronauts scramble to their stations as The Captain
fixes his stare on the map a lion closing in on his prey

EXT SPACE - NIGHT

The star capsule RACES OFF leaving a BLAZING STREAK

CUT TO

EXT COLORADO - ESTABLISHING - DAY

A truck passes a sign WELCOME TO HISTORIC GRAND LAKE
COLORADO It pulls over to let Adam and The Pilot out

EXT SHADOW MOUNTAIN JUNIOR HIGH â€”- DAY

Students swarm out the front crowding the main lawn The
Adams watch from across the street

ADAM
Is that her

A GIRL 13 is leaving school -- the only one of the crowd
not surrounded by friends and classmates She power-walks
(her regular pace) quickly outdistancing her peers This is
JR The Pilot glances down to the photograph -- still stained
with JRs blood He nods shaken

THE PILOT
Thats her Jimmy Ryan

MOMENTS LATER JR continues her power-walk home Adam and The
Pilot follow a safe distance back

ADAM
What do I have to do

THE PILOT
Talk to her You know how to talk
to girls right

ADAM
Uh no Why do you

THE PILOT
not really Just -- I dunno
Introduce yourself

ADAM
As what Her future lover

THE PILOT
Youre not -- I mean -- shes not
my -- we havent --

ADAM
Wow I really dont get better at
this do I

THE PILOT

Just give her this
The Pilot hands Adam a FOLDED NOTE

THE PILOT
You have to convince her to read it
-- and more importantly to
believe it

ADAM
Why What does it say

Adam starts to unfold the note The Pilot snatches it back

THE PILOT
Its private

ADAM
How can something be private from
yourself Technically Im the one
whos gonna write it

THE PILOT
You havent written it yet and
when you do youll understand why
you wouldnt let you read it

ADAM
That doesnt even make sense

Adam and The Pilot engage in a quick tug-of-war over the
note Suddenly a VOICE --

JR (0C)
Um excuse me Hi

The Adams turn -- JR has somehow gotten BEHIND THEM pepper
spray in hand

JR
So you guys have been following me
for like six blocks now You should
know Im a state-ranked brown belt
and my dads a cop

THE PILOT
Investment banker In jail for
securities fraud if my math is
right

JR frowns --

JR

Howd you know that Who are you
ADAM

Hes your boyfriend Or uh he

wants to be

The Pilot rolls his eyes smooth kid JR sizes up The Pilot
-- a monosyllabic judgment --

JR
Ew

EXT PARK â€” DAY

LATER JR sits alone on a park bench reading the note Adam
and The Pilot keep their distance

ADAM
Do you think shes gonna buy it

THE PILOT
I dont know You never know what
shes gonna do Thats part of her
charm

ADAM
I dont think she likes me

THE PILOT
She will And when she does youll
know what it feels like to achieve
something important

Adam has no idea what that means JR is returning with the
note she offers it back to The Pilot He studies her for a
reaction

THE PILOT
Did you read it

JR
(nods)
You should be a science fiction
writer Im not kidding no ones
ever written anything that cool for
me But you didnt think Id
actually believe it did you

THE PILOT
You have to If you dont youre
gonna die

JR
Yeah I got that part Charming
(she glances to Adam)
Who are you supposed to be His co-
pilot

ADAM
No Im him Like now Today

JR scrutinizes the pair noticing something She steps close
staring into Adams eyes He shifts uncomfortable

ADAM
What

JR
Nothing Its just strange You
both have an anomaly in your right

eye Specks of green a birth
defect Rare Kind of pretty
(then)

I still dont believe you
She turns to leave --

THE PILOT
JR wait --

JR
Dont follow me freak

The Pilot watches JR go He calls out desperate --

THE PILOT
Your mom started calling you JR
when you were five cause she
thought Jimmy sounded too much like
a boys name

JR
Nice try Everyone knows that

THE PILOT
You have a recurring dream that
youre being chased by your
neighbors dog In your underwear

JR stops in her tracks Turns to The Pilot He continues --
remembering every little detail about the woman he loved --

THE PILOT
You were scared of spiders when you
were little so you convinced your
Mom to buy you a pet tarantula and
now youre not scared anymore In
school you sometimes get questions
wrong on purpose cause you dont
want to skip another grade You try
not to raise your hand in class
but sometimes you cant help but
show everyone how smart you really
are You tell people you want to be
a doctor when you grow up but
you really want to fly

JR looks at The Pilot -- and in this moment -- she believes

From above a SONIC BOOM A STAR CAPSULE DESCENDS FROM THE
HEAVENS LANDING LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET AWAY

Adam JR and The Pilot stare in dumbstruck silence as the
capsule HISSES OPEN right in the middle of the park

JR STEPS OUT -- the woman from the photograph come to life
Shes 43 years old and stunning in her silver flightsuit

As if on cue the WIND picks up and SNATCHES the photograph
from The Pilots hands It flutters away never to be seen
again but The Pilot doesnt seem to notice or care He just
steps forward like a switch has been flipped and he finally
knows what he has to do

The Pilot SCOOPS JR into his arms and KISSES HER long and
well For a moment JR goes with it then REARS BACK and --

SLAP -- she delivers a blow so fierce it nearly spins The
Pilot around full-circle Only now do we see the ANGER in
JRs eyes

JR
You son of a bitch Do you have any
idea what you put me through

JR displays the NOTE now visibly aged She wags it in The
Pilots face --

JR
Thirty years For thirty years I
carried this stupid note I was --
(points to Young JR)
-- she She was going to have a
life of her own And you took that
from me From her from us

A beat as temperatures cool The boiling anger fades from
JRs eyes but she remains stiff arms crossed She remembers
her manners and nods to Young Adam --

JR
Hello Adam

Mouth agape all Adam can think to do is wave JR notices her
younger self staring blankly forward practically catatonic

JR
Am I all right

THE PILOT
Probably not

INT JRS HOUSE - DAY

Young JR sits on a couch wearing the exact same expression
Utter shock BEHIND HER JR takes in her childhood home --

JR
Incredible Everythings just the
way I remember it
(re her caged tarantula)
Hey Terry

ADAM
Yeah Im sure its all
fascinating but can someone please
explain to me what the hell just
happened

JR
Not much to explain I got your
note And everything happened just
the way you said When the time
came I commandeered one of
Zuckers ships and came back here --
to the coordinates you left for me

ADAM
Okay so does that mean its
over Did we win

JR
Not quite Tommys still coming
after us and Zuckers mission is
still a go

That last part caught The Pilots attention --

THE PILOT
What mission

MOMENTS LATER a BLUEPRINT is unrolled across a table -- a
schematic of a STAR CAPSULE like the others weve seen but
the measurements indicate a ship of MUCH LARGER SCALE

JR
I found this in Zuckers vault

ADAM
What is it

THE PILOT
Its a star capsule but
(studying the schematic)
is this even possible

JR
As far as I can tell it operates
by the same principles as the first
generation model Except its a lot
faster

ADAM
What does that mean

JR

It means this ship can take Zucker
back in time as far as he wants to
go -- into the ancient past And
thats not all For months hes
been stocking up on men supplies
weapons

(nods sure of it)
Hes building an army

This sinks in

THE PILOT
He doesnt just want to change the
past He wants to conquer it
(beat)
When do they launch

Surprisingly JR smiles
JR
They might have a little problem

there

INT JRS HOUSE - DAY

A HEAVY CASE is set down JR throws it open A HEAVENLY BLUE
LIGHT emanates from within Adam peers inside to find a GIANT
ORB OF CELIUM filling the entire crate

ADAM
Whoa
(he tries to lift it but
cant)
You got the mother lode

JR
Zuckers gonna need all of it to
power his machine Without this
hes stuck

THE PILOT
For now He can always harvest
more

JR
The enrichment process takes time --

THE PILOT

-- not enough Youve slowed him
down but we dont have a second to
lose

(off JRs look)
Our mission hasnt changed Make
sure your ships ready to fly
Were outta here in five minutes

JR
Im gonna need at least an hour to--

THE PILOT
-- five minutes Thats an order
Lieutenant

The Pilot turns away A look of hurt disappointment crosses
JRs face She closes the case with a SLAM

EXT BACK YARD - DAY

Adam pursues The Pilot out of the house as The Pilot lugs the
crate of celium into the yard

ADAM
What are you doing

THE PILOT
Whats it look like You wanna give
me a hand

ADAM
(ignoring that)
You brought that girl back from the
dead You said she was the girl of
our dreams and youre acting like
youre not even happy to see her

THE PILOT
You wouldnt understand

ADAM
I really wish youd stop saying
that

THE PILOT

You never had to lose her

JRs capsule UNCLOAKS right in the middle of the lawn Adam
follows The Pilot inside

ADAM
I dont believe it Youre a
youre just a youre a little

chicken-shit
The Pilot sets the crate down with a HEAVY THUD

THE PILOT
I dont think youre one to talk
In fact I know youre not

ADAM
Yeah but guess what Im twelve
Im allowed to be chicken-shit but
you youre supposed to be
better than this

THE PILOT
Better Kid Im an astronaut Ive
broken the speed of light I hosted
a kickball tournament on the moon
Ive been to Saturn Saturn What
more do you want from me

ADAM
I want you to grow a pair and tell
her --

JR

-- tell me what

JR has appeared outside the capsule The Pilot seems like
hes about to talk when Young JR calls out from the doorway--

YOUNG JR
Uh guys I think you might want to
come see this

INT JRS HOUSE - DAY

Adam The Pilot and JR gather around the TV broadcasting a
LOCAL NEWS REPORT ON SCREEN cell-phone footage of people
gathering on a street staring up at a FLAMING STREAK in the
sky Amateur footage of The Captains arrival

disturbance witnessed yesterday in
Iowa though the government

a disbelieving look Then relenting she shrugs

YOUNG JR

JR continues for the capsule Adam comes alongside

ADAM
Whatd you tell her

JR
I told her not to be so hard on
you

ADAM

Oh Thanks

INT JRS CAPSULE - NIGHT

The Pilot clears the larger rocks but SMALLER DEBRIS PELTS
THE SHIP CRACKS snake across the viewscreen

The Pilots device VIBRATES -- The Captains voice ECHOES --

THE CAPTAIN
Adam think about what youre
doing If you go back any further
I cant protect you

THE PILOT
Is that what youve been doing so
far Protecting me

THE CAPTAIN
I convinced Zucker to let me bring
you in alive but if you do this
all bets are off No telling what
the old man might do

THE PILOT
I understand the risks

JR
INCOMING

AHEAD a COLOSSAL ASTEROID the size of a skyscraper hurdles
towards them The Pilot targets a MINISCULE OPENING and
BLASTS THROUGH threading the needle A moment passes
then The Captain emerges also clearing the belt

The viewscreen now shows a CLEAR VIEW of OPEN SPACE

JR
Nows our chance If were gonna
breach it has to be now

The Pilots finger hovers over a BIG RED BUTTON The
Captains voice rings in his ears

THE CAPTAIN (0C)
It doesnt have to be like this
Just circle back we can talk this
through Please Adam

THE PILOT

A torpedo LAUNCHES FRACTURING OFF into a MULTI-HIT
PROJECTILE

The Pilot VEERS across space -- a deadly game of cat and
mouse with the fractured torpedo JR climbs in back with
Adam helping him situate his mask

JR
Okay focus Youre about to get a
crash course in faster-than-light
astronautics Speed is all about
reducing friction The ship will do
its job but you have to do yours
Clear your mind of everything all
thoughts and memories even the
sound of my voice Can you do that

Adam nods but his eyes are full of fear

The projectiles FLANK the ship coming in for the kill just
as the countdown reaches ZERO

THE PILOT
Drives online Everybody ready

ADAM JR
Ready for what Punch it

The Pilot PUSHES A LEVER --

The space ahead seems to CONTORT as the projectiles close in
from all directions They COLLIDE with a MASSIVE ZERO-GRAVITY
EXPLOSION

The Captain watches as the vacuum of space absorbs the blast
to REVEAL --

EXT WORMHOLEINT JRS CAPSULE - NIGHT

BREACHING THE LUMINAL BARRIER We shift into ADAMS POV
experiencing the teeth-rattling rush of lightspeed for the
first time He glances out the window as the starfield
COLLAPSES into a SINGLE POINT OF LIGHT the light EXPANDS
into a TUNNEL which ENVELOPS the ship as we TRANSITION TO --

A BRILLIANT FLASH OF IMAGES --

FLASH Tommy hits a LINE DRIVE HOMERUN as CROWDS CHEER and
Adam watches from the sidelines

FLASH Adam pulls away from Tommy at the window --

JR
One way to find out

THE PILOT
Sling-shot

Sling-shot

YOUNG ADAM

THE PILOT SLING-SHOTS THE CAPSULE AROUND THE MOON --

The sudden speed causes Adam to RETCH in his mask He
apologizes to JR with his eyes

The Pilot completes the sling-shot maneuver ROCKETING back
towards Earth Gravity takes hold and the capsule enters the
atmosphere It instantly catches FIRE Layers of the exterior
shell BURN UP and PEEL OFF disintegrating immediately

A LAND MASS appears through the clouds EUROPE

EXT LONDON - RIVER THAMES - DAY

Tourists fill the Parliament grounds posing in front of the
Big Ben snapping photos from Westminster Bridge In the
distance the London Eye is gleaming and freshly-built

INT JRS CAPSULE - DAY

Adams SCREAMS are overwhelmed by the DEAFENING NOISE of the
crashing ship The Pilot decelerates but the ground is
coming up fast Its gonna be close

EXT RIVER THAMES - DAY

BAM The capsule SMASHES into the Thames SKIPPING LIKE A
ROCK

A PAIR OF SAILBOATS ahead Adam BANKS HARD skirting between
the watercraft as the occupants dive over the side

ON THE BRIDGE tourists see the ship coming They RUN
SCREAMING abandoning their belongings It looks like the
capsule is on a collision course --

-- before it LOSES ALTITUDE at the last moment passing UNDER
THE ARCHES displacing HUGE AMOUNTS OF WATER which SOAKS the
pedestrians above

The capsule skids to a graceless stop across the river
surface It bobs a moment Then SINKS

INT JRS CAPSULE - DAY

Descending rapidly through the river depths JR starts to
unlatch the celium crate

THE PILOT
Leave it Theres no time Dont
worry itll survive the blast

ADAM
Blast what blast

The Pilot finishes keying in a sequence He moves for an
EMERGENCY HATCH

THE PILOT

On my count take a deep breath
Make for the surface Theyre gonna
try to arrest us so swim opposite
directions Lead them off

(a sudden thought he

looks to Adam)
Are you sure you can do this

Adam manages a weak thumbs up

ADAM
Easy peasy

The Pilot smiles finding comfort in Adams humor He grips
the hatch --

THE PILOT
One Two THREE

Everyone takes a DEEP BREATH and The Pilot OPENS THE HATCH --

Water SLAMS into the cockpit SUBMERGING our group They swim
off DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS as the capsule SINKS into oblivion

EXT RIVER THAMES - DAY

Adam pulls himself out of the river IN THE DISTANCE he sees
The Pilot and JR already surrounded by police

MOMENTS LATER Adam pushes through the crowd The Pilot and
JR are under arrest handcuffs SNAPPED on as The Pilot pleads
with the squad leader --

THE PILOT
Listen I know how this is gonna
sound but what day is it What
year

JR
Adam

JR is focused on a newsstand Every paper features the
current date JULY 2 2000

A look of SHEER PANIC crosses The Pilots face He LUNGES
against his restraints pulling free from the constable He
reaches for his Athens device --

-- but its knocked from his hands skidding across the
ground stopping at Adams feet Adam picks it up

The Pilot is overpowered SLAMMED onto a car hood His head
is held down forcing his gaze to Adam He SHOUTS --

THE PILOT
Adam Its up to you You have to
save her
(Adam doesnt understand)
Marie Shes gonna die Adam
Today

COPS start coming towards Adam when they see him holding the
fallen device

THE PILOT
GO

Adam comes to his senses and RUNS slipping off into the
crowd using his lack of size as an advantage to evade
police Mid-run he activates the device --

A newspaper article fills the screen NOBEL LAUREATE KILLED
IN FATAL CRASH FOCUS on the time of the accident 245 PM

Adam has a clear view of the Big Ben just past 230 He
inwardly groans -- figures -- then HAULS ASS Behind him --

SHOOTING STRAIGHT UP right in the middle of the Thames

CUT TO

INT LECTURE HALL - DAY

DR MARIE GORDON 50s is at the podium addressing a
sparsely-crowded auditorium As she speaks we PAN THROUGH
the crowd -- a sea of drooping eyelids and disbelieving
smirks This woman obviously isnt taken seriously

MARIE
as we know an object gains
Mass as it gains speed which
requires energy so as an object
approaches the speed of light its
mass becomes infinite -- thereby
requiring an equal amount of energy
to break the luminal barrier In
short to go beyond infinity But
what if infinity is closer than we
think What if we could break the
luminal barrier without even
breaking the speed limit on the M4
through the manipulation and
deformation of spacetime itself

Muffled laughter from a distant corner of the auditorium

Marie shrugs -- the possibilities alive only in her
imagination
MARIE
What if

EXT LONDON STREET CORNER - DAY

Adam runs to catch a DOUBLE DECKER BUS already pulling away
He barely makes it -- breathlessly addresses the DRIVER --

Adam shuts his eyes and emits a SHOCKWAVE that SHATTERS EVERY
WINDOW on the bus PASSENGERS SCREAM evacuating the bus in

DISPATCH
It should be there

The Pilot turns towards the park Eyes go wide --

THE PILOT
BRACE

THE BUS COMES OUT OF NOWHERE clipping the front of the
patrol car sending it SPINNING OUT across lanes of traffic
We can faintly hear Adam SHOUTING back as the bus VEERS OFF
towards Oxford Circus --

ADAM (0C)
Sorryyy

The cruiser is badly-damaged but operational the officer

unconscious behind the wheel The Pilot and JR climb out in
time to see the bus careen around a bend A shared glance

JR
Im driving

MOMENTS LATER the patrol car SCREECHES off in pursuit of the
bus leaving the officer splayed out across a park bench

INT MARIES CAR - DAY

The clock on the dash reads 244 One minute to go Marie is
still on the phone with Arnie --

MARIE
Well Im not saying you cant have
a party lets just not get ahead
of ourselves We should at least
verify the --

She hits a bump and spills coffee on her blouse

MARIE
Oh shoot just a second
(fumbling for a napkin)
Three PhDs and I cant even have a
cup of coffee without making a mess
of myself

INT DOUBLE DECKER BUS â€”- DAY

The bus SLAMS through a barricade riding the shoulder Adam
checks the time Exactly 245

ADAM
Gas hit the gas dont stop dont

The kid SLAMS THE GAS flooring it

EXT OXFORD AND REGENT - DAY

Maries car comes to a stop at a busy intersection WIDEN to
REVEAL the road signs -- OXFORD and REGENT

The light turns green Marie idles into the intersection
failing to notice an SUV racing through the opposing red
light at 70 mph barreling down on her too fast to stop
Suddenly --

CRASH The double decker bus comes out of nowhere blocking
the SUV and absorbing the collision in the nick of time

The crash SLAMS the bus sideways into Maries car SMASHING
it against a concrete partition

Then silence No way of knowing who survived
PUSH IN on the smoking husk of the bus The doors OPEN --

Adam staggers out He finds Maries car pancaked between
steel and concrete He climbs onto the sunroof Starts
POUNDING on the glass

ADAM
Hello Dr Gordon

No response Adam finds a loose chunk of debris and SMASHES
in the sunroof He drops into the car --

INSIDE THE CAR Marie is slumped against the wheel From
somewhere we hear the DISEMBODIED VOICE of the man she was
talking to --

VOICE
Marie are you there Marie Can
you hear me

Adam finds and hangs up the phone He focuses on Marie Its
hard to even tell if shes even breathing until her eyes
BLINK OPEN and settle on Adam

MARIE
Hello

Adam smiles overcome with relief

ADAM
Hi

MARIE
I dont mean to be rude but who
are you

ADAM

Im uh
(settling on the truth)
Â» an astronaut from the future
Marie takes that in Nods delirious

MARIE
All right

She passes out Adam collapses in the passenger seat beside
her Exhausted

EXT OXFORD AND REGENT - MOMENTS LATER

The Pilot and JR pull up in the busted patrol car Adam and
the Little Kid are hauling Marie from the wreck between them

ADAM
I did it I saved her

The Pilot takes in the MASSIVE PILE-UP

THE PILOT
Yeah good job

SIRENS approach The Pilot and JR hurry to help as we CUT TO--
NEW ANGLE -- The Captain spies on the scene from a distant
rooftop He turns to the other astronauts all waiting for

a decision He nods

THE CAPTAIN
Call it in

CUT TO

INT PICADILLY RESTAURANT - DAY

Adam and The Pilot wolf down food with bizarrely synchronous
gestures mirroring one anothers idiosyncracies Across the
table Marie can only stare

THE PILOT ADAM
What What

Marie shakes that off starts gathering up her things

MARIE
Listen I appreciate everything
youve done but what youre asking
me to believe -- that you knew the
accident was going to happen Come
on

The Pilot slides his Athens device across the table -- still
chronicling the gory details of Maries death

Maries face drops as she studies the article She shakes her
head Refusing to believe it

MARIE
- this doesnt prove anything

THE PILOT
What do you think We forged that
Then what staged the accident
ourselves

MARIE
Is that any harder to believe than
time-traveling astronauts on a
mission to to do what exactly

THE PILOT
To warn you
(he leans in)
You need to shut it down Your lab
your research All of it

MARIE
Why would I do that

THE PILOT
Because one day -- one day soon --
youre going to unlock the secret
to time travel and effectively hand
control of the universe over to one
man Arnand Zucker

A tense beat -- then Marie LAUGHS
MARIE
Arnie Please He put you up to

this didnt he

Marie stands to leave The Pilot grabs her hand

THE PILOT
Youre harnessing celium In your
lab as we speak Thats how it all
starts

MARIE
Let go of my hand

THE PILOT

Its silicon-based highly
unstable until you try testing it
at extreme temperatures at which
point it not only stabilizes but
yields an unlimited output
essentially creating energy from
nothing Tell me Im wrong

MARIE
I dont even know what celium is
Frankly it sounds made up

This Pilot blinks He wasnt prepared for that He lets go of
Maries hand

MARIE
its a good story though Race
against time save the world and
all that Very exciting And the
outfits I love the outfits

With that Marie is gone leaving our trio behind in their
matching shiny flightsuits

EXT STREET - DAY

Marie exits the restaurant As soon as shes clear we notice
that her hands are SHAKING She strides quickly off

CUT TO

EXT VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

A star capsule comes in for a landing before The Captain
standing alone in an open field The ramp descends and Jasper
emerges followed shortly behind by Laura and Dash They have
to SHOUT over the ROAR of the machine --

JASPER
Its not good The old man says
youve lost control He wants Adam
neutralized

THE CAPTAIN
Neutralized

The Captain notices the KILL TEAM emerging from smoke behind
Jasper filing down the ramp Trained soldiers armed to the
teeth faces obscured by high-tech faceplates

THE CAPTAIN
youre gonna kill him

Jasper shrugs whatd you expect The Captain looks to Laura
and Dash to confirm but they cant meet his gaze

THE CAPTAIN
I cant let you do that

JASPER
I thought you might feel that way

Jasper nods to the soldiers They APPREHEND The Captain
grabbing him by either arm

THE CAPTAIN

What the -- what are you doing
JASPER

What you shouldve already done

Sir

Restraints are clamped on Jasper steps close

JASPER
Not to worry Cap Your title will
be reinstated as soon as Adams
handled The old man wanted me to
be clear about that In the
meantime

Jasper gives a signal and the kill team moves out in perfect

formation to a series of waiting transports The Captain is

helpless to do anything but watch This is gonna get ugly
CUT TO

EXT RENT-A-CAR -â€” PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The Pilot and Adam sit alone in a (presumably) stolen car
staking out the lot of a rental agency

ADAM
What do we do now

THE PILOT
Follow the good doctor until she
leads us to something we can use
against the program

Adam nods staring vacantly out the window The Pilot notices
his distant expression

THE PILOT
Whats wrong

ADAM
Nothing
(then)
When we were coming in back on the
ship I thought I

THE PILOT
- Saw something

ADAM
Yes

THE PILOT
Like a memory

ADAM
Yes Except it was strange Like a
memory that never happened

THE PILOT
It did happen it just hasnt
happened yet We call them
flashbulb premonitions Weve all
had them Try not to worry about
it

The Pilot can see Adam isnt satisfied He leans in --

THE PILOT
Listen I know youve got
questions I would too But if I
told you everything you wanted to
know you could wind up on a
completely different course

ADAM
Different from what From you
(beat)
What if I dont want to be you

The question stings JR returns to the car cutting off the
conversation

JR
Shes on the move Purple Neon
heading north on Barton

The Pilot keys the ignition

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

Tailing a DODGE NEON into a residential neighborhood AHEAD
a HOUSE PARTY is in full swing

BLASTING MUSIC can be heard all the way down the street
Nearly a hundred people are crammed into the house many
spilling onto the lawn where a table tennis tournament looks
to be entering its third hour

JR
This cant be where shes going

But sure enough Marie leaves her car and heads straight into
the party Adam takes in the crowd

ADAM
These are the people who take over
the world

THE PILOT
Its always the nerds Wait here

The Pilot gets out Adam and JR share a glance once hes gone
- roll their eyes follow after him

INT HOUSE - NIGHT

The place is packed Marie moves through the ocean of bodies
until she finds who shes looking for -- a YOUNG MAN with his
back turned staring forward at something with great
interest She SHOUTS over the music --

MARIE
Arnie I need to talk to you

ARNAND ZUCKER hardly seems old enough to be out of college
let alone the master of the universe we know him to be

ZUCKER
Not now Marie I have to
concentrate

MARIE
Its important

ZUCKER
So is this

Zucker holds up a PING PONG BALL With the focus of a heart
surgeon he BOUNCES it across the table into a red plastic
cup Crowds ERUPT in CELEBRATION The vanquished player
groans -- lifts his cup in salute --

ZUCKER
Drink it And leave the ball in
this time Bosss orders

Finally Zucker turns to Marie His smile fades when he sees
her -- still banged up from the accident

ZUCKER
My God what happened to you

MARIE
What Oh -- this nothing I was in
a car accident

ZUCKER
You were in a car accident and
thats not what you want to talk to
me about

Off Maries reaction where to begin

ACROSS THE PARTY The Pilot enters drawing a bit of
attention to himself He spots Zucker and Marie across the
room Starts making his way over

BACK TO ZUCKER AND MARIE -- mid-story --

MARIE
--- but you should have seen them
Arnie they were genuinely serious
They actually believed --

ZUCKER
-- what That they were from the
future Come on Marie its obvious
someone was having a go at you The
important thing is youre safe
And youre at a party Try to
lighten up a bit

Zucker hands Marie a drink

MARIE
I dont want this

ZUCKER
You will When I tell you why were
celebrating

Marie looks Zucker in the eye and for a moment all
worries of time-traveling astronauts are forgotten

MARIE
You verified the results

ZUCKER
Im telling you M this stuff is
miraculous I can feel it this is
everything weve waited for
everything weve worked for Ive
already put in a bid to double our
labs supply

Over Zuckers shoulder Marie spots THE PILOT coming towards
her through throngs of partygoers

MARIE
Arnie --

ZUCKER
(talking over her)
-- and we even have a name for it
now too Jared thought it up on
the way over And here I thought he
was completely useless --

MARIE
-- Arnie thats him thats --

ZUCKER
Celium

Marie FREEZES at the word

MARIE
- what

ZUCKER
Celium Thats what were calling
it Has a ring dont you think

Marie meets eyes with The Pilot across the room She pushes
past Zucker

MARIE
Excuse me

Zucker watches after Marie as she intercepts The Pilot and
discreetly pulls him out the back door His eyes narrow
suspicious then he addresses the crowd --

ZUCKER
Whos my next victim

Volunteers CHEER pushing enthusiastically forward

EXT BACK LAWN - NIGHT

Marie confers with The Pilot and JR --
MARIE
Okay so assuming for one second I
believed you are who you say you
are whats the next step

JR
That depends Youre sure Zucker
knows about celium

MARIE
He begins field testing tomorrow
Hes already buying up mines of the
stuff

JR
It wont be long before he turns
his attention to space

MARIE
Space Outer space No no thats
impossible Arnie gets carsick

So far The Pilot has said nothing Marie notices

MARIE
What are you going to do

THE PILOT

Whatever I have to
(then)
Im sorry

MARIE
For what

worried

A SUBTLE PULSE and Marie faints into The Pilots arms A few
partygoers notice but The Pilot waves off their concerns --

THE PILOT
Shes fine Just had a bit too much
to drink

JR helps The Pilot ease Marie into a comfortable resting

position

THE PILOT
Stay with her

She knows what hes thinking

JR
Adam you cant do this

THE PILOT
Starting tomorrow the company goes
public with the results If Zucker
dies tonight the program dies with
him

JR
If we do it like this were no
better than he is

The Pilot nods he knows its the truth Something occurs to
him he looks around Uh-oh

THE PILOT
Wheres Adam

INT HOUSE - NIGHT

The beer pong tournament has become TRULY EPIC Adam sinks a
MASTERFUL SHOT Crowds ROAR hoisting Adam up in victory as
the loser -- Zucker -- is forced to drink

ZUCKER
Youre quite good at this young
man I think your size gives you an
unfair advantage

The Pilot appears fixed on Adam

THE PILOT
There you are You had me worried
sick

ZUCKER

Oh Im sure he didnt mean any
harm Is that your little one I
can tell hes got your eyes
(then on closer
inspection)
Good God man what are you wearing

Zucker pauses when he notices the logo on The Pilots suit
NEXTSTAR CORP Even drunk we can detect a flash of the cold
calculating intelligence in Zuckers eyes

ZUCKER
Ah I see You came with Marie
didnt you I heard you played
something of a practical joke on
her I can assure you I will not
be so easily fooled

THE PILOT
I believe you

ZUCKER

Although I admit I am impressed
You only couldve known what you
knew if someone with access put you
up to it One of my staff perhaps
Maybe even someone in this house

(a conspiring whisper)
Give me their names and whatever
they paid you Ill double it

THE PILOT
Is there someplace we can talk

For a moment the two lock eyes Across the table Adam
watches with the interest of a voyeur Finally Zucker
smiles ignoring whatever internal warnings may be sounding

ZUCKER
Of course Follow me

Zucker leads The Pilot off As he does The Pilot quietly
reaches into his pocket and activates his Athens device

CUT TO

EXT VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

Dash keeps watch over The Captain Hes pacing nervous The
Captains eyes follow him sensing weakness

THE CAPTAIN
Theyre gonna kill him Dash You
know Jasper he wont even give
Adam a chance to surrender

Dash stops pacing
THE CAPTAIN
I know you like him I know he was

your friend We can still save him

A beat Dash is toying with the key to The Captains
restraints He turns A decision reached

DASH
Make it look good

Dash tosses the key The Captain realizes what hes asking

MOMENTS LATER the CRACK of a PUNCH and Dash SPRAWLS OUT in
the field unconscious A transport races off

INT TRANSPORT - NIGHT

The Captain drives in a panic swerving through traffic His
Athens device is tuned to the kill teams frequency --

JASPERS VOICE
All units stand by prepare to push
in on my command

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

The kill team sweeps through shadows checking weapons
positioning charges None of the surrounding partygoers comes
close to noticing

INT HOUSE - ZUCKERS PARLOR - NIGHT

Zucker leads The Pilot into a private study A DRUNK COUPLE
excuses themselves from making out avoiding eye contact
Sorry Boss Zucker crosses to the bar

ZUCKER
You know what they say The harder
they work

He starts preparing a couple drinks Unbeknownst to them
both ADAM crouches at the door listening in

ZUCKER
So what are you exactly The
three of you Some sort of
traveling troupe

THE PILOT
Something like that

The Pilots hand remains in his pocket -- like a gunslinger
preparing to draw Zucker hands him a drink The Pilot uses
his free hand to accept it

ZUCKER
Of course I can take a joke as
well as the next fellow but you
must understand what we do here is
very sensitive

THE PILOT
And whats that exactly

ZUCKER
We punch holes in the universe
(a disarming smile)
Thats the dream anyway

THE PILOT
interesting dream

The Pilot takes a sip without breaking eye contact
ZUCKER

So go on A deals a deal Who put

you up to it
The Pilot just stares at Zucker Impossible to read
CLOSE ON ZUCKER starting to realize something is wrong here
Something in the way The Pilot is staring at him the slow-
burning intensity behind his eyes

Zucker moves to get around The Pilot A BURST OF MOVEMENT --

The Pilot DROPS his glass and PULLS his Athens device It
retracts into BLASTER MODE as the glass SHATTERS and Adam
RUNS IN --

ADAM
Dont

The Pilot freezes Finger on the trigger

THE PILOT
Get out of here Adam

ADAM
You cant do this This isnt us

THE PILOT
(convincing himself)
We dont have a choice

ADAM
We have to Were not a killer

Zucker looks between the two Adams

ZUCKER

Shut up
The Pilots grip tightens but his hands are shaking Hes

losing his nerve He cant do it

Just as he starts to lower the weapon -- BOOM AN EXPLOSION
ROCKS THE HOUSE

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

the face of the house SCREAMING PANIC as guests scramble to
evacuate

RANDOM PARTYGOER

Jasper and his team advance into the melee rifles raised
JASPER
All units advance Sweep in pairs
No one leaves until we ID the
targets

Faceplate readouts SEE THROUGH WALLS scanning and
identifying the panicked crowd as they flee past

INT ZUCKERS PARLOR - NIGHT

The Pilot picks out from under debris Zucker is gone Damn
He crouches over Adam SLAPS him awake

THE PILOT
Listen I want you to stay here
Hold for my signal then run Dont
wait for me Here --

The Pilot hands Adam his Athens device

ADAM
Whats this for
THE PILOT
Think like me Youll know what to

do
With that The Pilot SPRINTS from the room head down

He slides into the kitchen as artillery pock-marks the wall
behind him EXPLODING the contents of the fridge

Back to the counter The Pilot KICKS the stove until it JARS
LOOSE A gas line SEVERS HISSING flammable fumes

ON THE KILL TEAM sweeping through the house

SOLDIERS POV -- Pilot-shaped infrared BREAKS COVER and RUNS
On instinct the soldier raises his rifle --

JASPER
No DONT

-- and FIRES catching the gas line which SPARKS then
IGNITES in a STAGGERED CATACLYSMIC EXPLOSION that DEVASTATES
whats left of the house The Pilot dives clear of the blast

ON ADAM feeling the impact of the explosion He SPRINTS out
a side exit unnoticed in the commotion

EXT BACK YARD - NIGHT

The Pilot recovers from the blast He starts to stand when a
VOICE from behind stops him cold

THE CAPTAIN
Adam

The Pilot turns THE CAPTAIN has his blaster raised The
Pilot shows his hands

ON ADAM crouched in hiding From his vantage point he can
see The Pilots predicament He STARTS FORWARD intending to
intervene --

-- but The Pilot wordlessly signals him to stay back All the
while The Pilot keeps his gaze fixed on The Captain SOUNDS
of the kill team getting closer hang over the scene

THE CAPTAIN
No more running Adam Its over
(re the house)
Looks like you pushed one too many
of the old mans buttons when you
stole that celium

THE PILOT
You think Im just gonna tell you
where it is

THE CAPTAIN
Theres no other way out of this
Theyve cut off every escape within
fifty miles If you even try to
run theyll shoot you And JR You
want out of this you have to do
what I say

THE PILOT
Thats what Im good at right
Doing what you say Following
orders Look where it got me

THE CAPTAIN
You know none of this was my fault
You started this you can end
it

The Captain retracts his blaster Moving forward as though
approaching a wild animal

THE CAPTAIN
Just stop running Just trust me

A long beat as The Pilot decides

EXT BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

Soldiers clear the flaming wreckage JR is with them already
restrained Through the smoke a figure appears -- THE
CAPTAIN accompanied by The Pilot

THE CAPTAIN
Relax gentlemen I want it noted
he surrendered of his own accord

JR
Adam Wheres --

The Pilot subtly shakes his head dont mention the kid JR
clams up as Jasper PUSHES past her -- badly burned from the

blast and pissed

JASPER
Where is he Im gonna kill him

Jasper raises his blaster to The Pilot but The Captain steps
between them

THE CAPTAIN
Wait Jasper wait Its okay we
got him He told us where the
celium is Ive already dispatched
a retrieval team Its over

A beat Slowly Jasper calms He begrudgingly stows his
weapon but cant help but SLUG The Pilot once in the gut
doubling him over JR winces

That accomplished Jasper nods to the others Soldiers
advance The Pilot glances back in the direction Adam took
off before hes SHOVED forward

Adam hangs up He goes to put the phone away when he notices
the Athens device still in his hands

He remembers The Pilots final words to him --

He frowns notices --

A SCAR has materialized on his left arm -- a SINGLE INCISION
has turned the curve-shaped scar on his right arm into the
number 9 As this sinks in

THE CAPTAIN (0C)
Strange

The Pilot hides the scar as The Captain takes the empty seat
beside him He indicates out the window A distant view of
Earth

THE CAPTAIN
- up here everything looks the
same

The Pilot says nothing The Captain lowers his voice --

THE CAPTAIN
You gotta give the old man some
credit Just explain what happened

THE PILOT
We had a deal We said we wouldnt
try to change the past

THE CAPTAIN
Really Then whatve you been doing

The Pilot suddenly doesnt seem so sure

THE CAPTAIN
Try to think of the bigger picture
Weve got a chance to shape the
future Isnt that the dream

THE PILOT
Not my dream I never wanted any
of this
THE CAPTAIN
Then why didnt you just quit

The Pilot considers

THE PILOT
Because I couldnt remember

THE CAPTAIN
Remember what

Who I was if I wasnt the guy
trying to live up to your standard

That stings

THE CAPTAIN
Â» and now

THE PILOT
Now I remember

From the pilots chair Laura interrupts --

MARIE
To get you past the guards

With that shes gone

INT NEXTSTAR LOBBY - NIGHT

A security guard named FRANK mans the front desk listening
to ISLAND MUSIC via headphones which is why he doesnt
notice as a CRANE rumbles to life outside the facility

Frank HUMS ALONG to the music as the crane arm SWINGS AROUND
getting closer closer closer Finally --

CRASH THE CRANE SLICES THROUGH THE BUILDING Frank dives for
cover as SMOKE and DEBRIS fills the air He scrambles to his
feet failing to notice as ADAM sneaks in through the
commotion hiding behind a SCALE MODEL of an EARLY STAR
CAPSULE DESIGN that dominates the lobby

Frank fumbles for his radio --

FRANK
Disturbance on level one
requesting backup Repeat
requesting immediate backup

Frank sighs taking in the surreal sight of the crane arm
wedged through the middle of the rotunda

FRANK
Cause I sure as hell aint
cleaning this up

INT NEXTSTAR HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - NIGHT The Pilot and JR are escorted through the SAME LOBBY now
glistening and intact They pass by FRANK -- the same guard
manning the same desk now well past retirement age

AHEAD a man stands with his back turned facing a BANK OF
MONITORS that cycle through NEWS BROADCASTS from around the
world Fires in Moscow Bombings in Washington Riots in
Greece Looting in Japan Global pandemonium

THE CAPTAIN
- Sir

The man turns -- ARNAND ZUCKER now in his 60s But this
isnt the optimistic kid we met before This man is hard and
cold his genius long-since joined with madness

The crate of celium is set down before Zucker and opened --
the blue glow fills his eyes He addresses The Pilot --

ZUCKER
Im curious did you really
believe you could swim upstream
from fate I admit Ive enjoyed
watching you try But here we are
despite your best efforts right
back where we started

THE PILOT
Not exactly sir

Zucker bristles For a minute it seems like he might do The
Pilot harm but instead he just smiles Almost charming

ZUCKER
I want to show you something
(he nods to The Captain)
Its time

INT LOBBY - NIGHT Adam starts to sneak off when BROKEN GLASS CRUNCHES
underfoot Frank SPINS --

He clicks on his flashlight and steps around the star capsule
model Adam is careful to move with him keeping the model
between them as they trade positions

A tense beat Frank turns away content that hes alone Adam
breathes a sigh of relief until the model TILTS FORWARD
and SMASHES to the floor

Frank stares at Adam Adam stares at Frank Adam smiles
then RUNS Frank CHASES after him grabbing for his walkie

FRANK
Breach Security breach on level
one Hes heading for the
elevators

INT LOBBY - NIGHT Striding for the elevators Zucker leads the way --

THE CAPTAIN
Are you saying we have to leave
now Tonight

ZUCKER
My hands have been forced Your
brothers stunt has drawn some
unwanted attention to our
operations It wont be long before
the wrong people start asking the
right questions

Off the reactions of the astronauts Nervous unsure

INT LOBBY - NIGHT Adam race for the elevators Security guards move to cut him
off but Adam LAYS THEM OUT with WELL-TARGETED BLOOMERS
Guards fly like popcorn against the lobby walls

AT THE ELEVATORS Adam fumbles with the cardkey He SWIPES it
through a reader A RED LIGHT FLASHES Access denied

INT LOBBY - NIGHT A GREEN LIGHT FLASHES as Zucker SWIPES his cardkey A SECRET
ELEVATOR opens From the looks of the crew no one knew it
was there -- not even Tommy Zucker enters

ZUCKER
Going down

INT LOBBY - NIGHT Adam swipes again again again Nothing but red NEARBY
guards have regrouped and are CHARGING towards him

Finally the GREEN LIGHT FLASHES and the elevator OPENS Adam
runs inside tap-tap-tapping the DOOR CLOSE button The doors
close just as the guards POUND against them

INT ELEVATOR - NIGHT Crammed into the elevator going down Way down Zucker
whispers to The Pilot --

ZUCKER
The truth is in retrospect it
seems almost inevitable -- your

betrayal You never had any stomach
for the bigger picture

THE PILOT
Enlighten me

ZUCKER
It got to me when I was young
Crawled in behind my eyes like a
parasite and soon I couldnt see
anything else It was a vision

THE PILOT
a vision of what

ZUCKER
The future

The elevator stops Doors open to REVEAL --

INT SECTOR NINE - DOCKING STATION - NIGHT

A CAVERNOUS CHAMBER filled with SOLDIERS and ENGINEERS
clambering over the frame of a TOWERING STAR CAPSULE --

Its the machine from JRs blueprints brought to vivid awe-
inspiring life Zucker has the unmistakable glow of a
fathers pride --

ZUCKER
Just as I always imagined it would
be

The Pilot notices a sign that reads SECTOR NINE He
subconsciously covers the scar on his arm

INT SECTOR NINE - NIGHT The SAME ELEVATOR opens to reveal the SAME FACILITY but
no star capsule Not yet built Adam enters --

Behind him the elevator is CALLED UP Only a matter of time
before the guards return Adam quickly gets to work He
selects an app off the device and FIRES CRATERING the floor

INT DOCKING STATION - NIGHT A platform DESCENDS lowering the soldiers and astronauts
past the frame of the incredible ship

ZUCKER
Im calling her The Ark Capable of
withstanding speeds nearly a
thousand times greater than the
first generation model

JR notices MASSIVE ELECTRIC GENERATORS lining the walls of
the chamber She frowns --

JR
What are the generators for The
capsules dont run on electric
power

ZUCKER

Clever girl It turns out Dr
Gordon had it right all along The
key to superluminal travel isnt to
move faster than light but to
deform spacetime into faster-than-
light speeds Like a doorway into
the past and all you have to do is

step through

JR
A doorway Youre talking about a
black hole In the middle of
Europe

ON THE ASTRONAUTS frozen by this revelation Zucker is
prepared for this He nods admits --

ZUCKER
The dream is coming at a larger
cost than originally imagined And
yes the world as you know it will
likely be destroyed But from the
ashes a new world will be born A
new future of our own design
under our control

THE PILOT
You mean your control

Zucker ignores that -- focused on the others --

ZUCKER
I never could have gotten this far
without you All of you
(beat)
I hope youre with me now

The astronauts are clearly conflicted but also aware of
the HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS standing to attention nearby The
Captain is the first to step forward

THE CAPTAIN
Were with you Boss

The Pilot shoots The Captain a glare which he ignores One
by one the other astronauts step forward joining The
Captain

Zucker grins as he expected He nods to his CHIEF TECH --

ZUCKER
Fire her up

Switches are flipped and generators ROAR to life -- huge
amounts of energy cycling through this facility

EXT NEXTSTAR CAMPUS - NIGHT

MAGNETIC FIELD EMITTERS rise from underground forming a
CIRCLE They begin to ROTATE faster and faster

INT SECTOR NINE - NIGHT Adam digs in a frenzy deepening the hole The elevator is on
its way down Whatever hes doing hes running out of time

INT DOCKING STATION - NIGHT The station has turned into a hive of activity soldiers
loading GEAR and SUPPLIES onto the Ark JR whispers to The
Pilot --

JR
In case we dont get out of this I
just wanted to say thank you

THE PILOT
For what

JR
For saving my life
(off The Pilots look)
Its probably the nicest thing
anyones ever done for me

This sinks in Their hands join through restraints NEARBY
The Captain overhears the exchange
Zucker SHOUTS UP to the engineers on top of the Ark --

ZUCKER
Lock in the payload

HIGH ATOP THE ARK the celium core is locked into place The
entire ship POWERS TO LIFE the WHINE of machinery building
to a POWERFUL ROAR

EXT NEXTSTAR CAMPUS - NIGHT

The array spins FASTER a BLUR of IMPOSSIBLE MOVEMENT

The air above the campus starts to RIPPLE and BEND Weve
seen this sort of anomaly before Its a wormhole except
this one is just a few miles off the ground

Surrounding buildings start to COME APART uprooted into the
expanding vortex

INT DOCKING STATION - NIGHT The Pilot is SLAMMED against the side of the ship held down
prepared for execution JR SCREAMS --

JR
NO Tommy do something Dont let
them do this Tommy please

The Captain crosses to Zucker --

THE CAPTAIN
Sir we had a deal

ZUCKER
I agreed to let you bring your
brother in alive And there he is
perfectly alive

THE PILOT
Its okay JR just look away Look
away

Zucker leans close to The Captain --

ZUCKER
Dont forget what were doing here
Tommy Were rebooting the entire
human race We at the beginning
must be uncorrupted We must be
pure

(MORE)

ZUCKER (CONTD)
(he offers a blaster)

All of us
THE CAPTAIN
ee Sir
Zucker places the blaster in The Captains hand -- then

raises The Captains arm until his aim is fixed to the back
of The Pilots head

ZUCKER
Show me your heart is still in this
game

Zucker steps back as if hes flipped a switch and hes
waiting to see what will happen Glances pass between the
astronauts They didnt sign up for this JR struggles --

JR
No Tommy listen to me This isnt
you Tommy You cant do this

JRs voice rings in The Captains ears A long moment

then his arm LOWERS as if its been drained of
strength He looks to Zucker and shakes his head -- a single
whispered syllable --

THE CAPTAIN
No

Zucker nods his disappointment He takes back the blaster

ZUCKER
Thats the problem with soldiers
isnt it Once they stop following
orders they outlive their
usefulness

Zucker raises the blaster -- aimed at The Captain The
Captain closes his eyes accepting his fate

ZUCKER
I hope you dont mind my saying
Ive always thought of you as a
son

Zuckers finger grazes the trigger when suddenly --
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP

The noise is FAINT and DISTANT Zucker is the first to hear
it He lowers the blaster

ZUCKER
Quiet QUIET
Workers pause in their duties and the sound becomes clearer--
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP
Soldiers fan out instinctively rooting out the source of the
noise -- an oddly comical sight like a SWAT team hunting for

a cricket

INT SECTOR NINE - NIGHT Adam stops digging He enters a FAMILIAR DATE onto the Athens
device -- JUNE 4 2043 -- then buries the weapon --

INT DOCKING STATION - NIGHT Soldiers gather around a point on the floor where the noise
is loudest A soldier LEANS DOWN --

SOLDIER
What is that

ON THE PILOT surreptitiously backing away from the noise
He indicates for JR to do the same

INT SECTOR NINE - NIGHT As Adam fills the hole we PAN DOWN to the buried Athens
device A COUNTDOWN has begun a forty year countdown

INT DOCKING STATION - NIGHT MATCH PAN below the floor where the SAME DEVICE has remained
buried for the PAST FORTY YEARS The countdown finishes --

32 2 1 BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEEEEEEEEEEP --

AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE FLOOR BLOWING A GIANT CRATER
RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE CHAMBER

Machinery goes HAYWIRE the roof RETRACTS and is immediately
RIPPED AWAY by the PULL of the WORMHOLE swirling above

TOTAL PANDEMONIUM The Pilot and JR STRIKE in unison taking
out a pair of soldiers before theyre overpowered
restrained about to be shot

but the astronauts make their move

Dash grabs a rifle as Laura palm-thrusts a soldiers nose
Jasper activates his plasma glove sending soldiers shooting
across the chamber The Pilot and JR twist free

IN THE SKY ABOVE THE CAMPUS the wormhole continues to
EXPAND spreading its path of destruction

Equipment is RIPPED FROM WALLS as though uprooted by a
POWERFUL TORNADO Engineers flee in an end-of-the-world
panic abandoning their stations running for their lives

Zucker steps forward completely disconnected from the chaos
that surrounds him He stares up at the wormhole entranced
as astronauts and engineers seek refuge inside the Ark

The Pilot turns back to find Zucker standing out in the
open clutching a rail They meet eyes Unbelievably Zucker
is SMILING

ZUCKER
Ive always wanted to punch a hole
in the universe

With that he LETS GO and goes FLYING into the void It pulls
him in and hes GONE -- VANISHED into space and time

IN THE FACILITY the last of the engineers piles into the Ark
-- all except JR Shes still outside working the generator
controls struggling to stay on her feet The Pilot SHOUTS --

THE PILOT
JR GET OUT OF THERE

JR
I HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THE ARRAY IF I
CAN OVERLOAD THE GENERATORS WE
MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE

The Pilot sprints to a storage locker in the Ark starts
frantically pulling on a flightsuit The Captain approaches --

THE CAPTAIN
Adam what are you doing You cant
go out there

THE PILOT
You cant stop me

The Captain GRABS The Pilot and SLAMS him against the wall

THE CAPTAIN
Want to bet

The Pilot looks his brother in the eye -- admits --

THE PILOT
Im not as strong as you Tommy
Im not strong enough to lose her

again

A moment between them Frustration Anger And then --
finally -- understanding The Captain releases The Pilot
Hands him an OXYGEN MASK

THE CAPTAIN
Good luck Kickstand

THE PILOT
Dont call me that

ON JR gripping onto the console as her feet LEAVE THE
GROUND pulled in by the wormhole She REACHES for a SHUTDOWN
LEVER -- almost there -- almost

And just as she finally GETS IT she LOSES HER GRIP and goes
FLYING out of the facility into open space reaching out for
help that isnt there

SLOW MOTION -- everything seems to happen at once --

The Pilot allows himself to be YANKED from the Ark pulled in
by the wormhole He angles his body like a GUIDED MISSILE
reaching for JR as the void extends its maw

HANDS CLASP The Pilot goes for a chute strap but the
gravitational forces are INCREDIBLY STRONG His eyelids
flutter on the edge of consciousness

BELOW generators ERUPT unable to handle the power

The array SHUTS DOWN and the wormhole collapses in on itself
VANISHING in a VIOLENT ERUPTION OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT

The light fades Were left with the view we began with --
Stars shine through the darkness of space
The Pilot and JR enter frame -- FLOATING as though

weightless eyes closed hands clasped wind whipping at
their hair REVEAL --

Theyre free-falling from THOUSANDS OF FEET IN THE AIR
unconscious at terminal velocity

Suddenly The Pilots eyes drift open He looks to JR
falling alongside him almost dreamlike He notices the
ground coming up fast Very fast This could be the end

A BURST OF AWARENESS --

The Pilot pulls JR in and ACTIVATES HIS CHUTE It deploys
but just before we can find out if they made it we --
CUT TO BLACK

EXT NEXTSTAR CAMPUS - SUNRISE The headquarters are still in decent condition save for the
crane arm wedged through the middle of the lobby

YOUNG ZUCKER steps out of an approaching car He finds MARIE
flanked by building security She smiles when she sees him

MARIE
Hello Arnie

Zucker is staggered by the scale of the destruction

YOUNG ZUCKER
Marie what have you done

MARIE
Lets just say I made an investment
in the future of this company
Zuckers expression hardens
YOUNG ZUCKER
You dont have a future with this
company Not anymore

Marie thinks it over Smiles

MARIE
I can live with that

She gives Zucker a kiss on the cheek and heads off leaving
him baffled

EXT CAMPUS - SUNRISE

Adam stands alone half a mile from the facility studying
the fading stars Marie approaches on foot Adam shakes his
head without turning from the sky

ADAM
They should be back by now

Marie follows Adams gaze into the heavens A solemn beat

Finally a FAMILIAR SOUND -- a SONIC BOOM A HUGE SMILE fills
Adams face

EXT NEXTSTAR HEADQUARTERS - SUNRISE

Back at the facility Zucker catches a FLEETING GLIMPSE of
the star capsule coming in for a landing vanishing behind
the treeline

Zucker starts moving forward slowly at first then
breaking into a MAD SPRINT

EXT CAMPUS - SUNRISE

The capsule lands The door HISSES OPEN venting steam Adam
waits holding his breath as a FIGURE emerges from the steam

The Pilot Impossible to read the expression on his face
until he steps aside --

JRis with him Theyre holding hands alive and well
Adam dashes up the ramp and FLIES into The Pilots arms

ADAM
I knew wed make it

THE PILOT
Im glad one of us did By the way
that stunt with the Athens device
Couldntve done it better myself

The Pilot acknowledges Marie as she ascends the ramp staring
up at the ship amazed He shakes her hand Sincere

THE PILOT
Thank you If theres anything I
can do

Marie is still taking in the sight of the capsule Her dream
come to life She smiles

MARIE
I could use a ride home

EXT CAMPUS - SUNRISE

MOMENTS LATER Zucker arrives at the landing site -- winded
panting for breath He scans the area -- no sign of the star
capsule Maybe it was just his imagination

Suddenly behind him a FLAMING STREAK cuts across the sky
before FADING and DISAPPEARING as if it was never even
there at all

DISSOLVE TO

EXT ARCHER RESIDENCE - SUNSET Bonnie steps outside lugging a garbage bag She looks like
she hasnt slept in days Behind her a SHOOTING STAR falls
from the sky and lands in the woods behind her house

Bosco takes off into the woods BARKING like mad

BONNIE
Bosco Dammit dumb dog

She runs after him

EXT CLEARING - SUNSET

Adam and The Pilot emerge from the capsule Home An awkward
moment between them neither sure what to say

THE PILOT
I guess this is it

ADAM
Will I ever see you again

They both smile realizing what an odd question that is
FURTHER BACK Bonnie chases Bosco into the woods --

BONNIE
Bosco Cmere boy

BACK TO THE ADAMS -- they can hear Bosco getting closer The
Pilot turns back for the capsule but stops He cant
resist He crouches down before his younger self

THE PILOT
All right listen Dont join Joe
Kirkpatricks paintball tournament
unless you want to lose vision out
of your right eye for three months
Dont ask Leslie to prom shed say
yes but youd rather go with
Stacey Also you love asparagus
but youre about to develop a late-
term allergy to avocado so stay
away from the guacamole at Kyle
Friedmans graduation party And
one night freshman year Amy
Gilfoils gonna offer you a ride
back to your dorm I know its
tempting I know shes cute but
dont get in that car And uh

(he thinks nods)

- yeah Thats it

ADAM
Whyd you tell me all that
THE PILOT
Because those were my mistakes You
have to start making your own
Starting now

A beat Adam nods The Pilot extends a hand Adam shakes it

EXT CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER

Bonnie pushes into the clearing She pulls up short the
breath stolen from her lungs

WHAT SHE SEES Adam stands in the middle of the clearing with
his back turned Bosco happily wags his tail as if to say
look who I found

BONNIE
Adam

Adam turns Bonnie wills herself to move She stumbles
forward and THROWS her arms around her son overcome with
relief

BONNIE
Oh my God are you okay baby
Are you hurt

ADAM
Im fine Really Mom Im okay
(then)
How are you

Bonnie pulls back from the hug She finds herself caught up
staring at Adam She almost doesnt recognize him

ADAM
- what

BONNIE
Nothing I just
(she has to ask)
When did you get so grown up

AN OFF-SCREEN BLAST cuts off Adams reply Bonnie GASPS as
the star capsule RISES over the horizon

Adam takes his mothers hand -- watching the capsule go with
an expression of total serenity

Bonnie soaks in the calmness of Adams expression maybe
for the first time noticing the silver flightsuit hes
wearing She holds her son as if hes the only thing keeping
her upright

The capsule departs receding into the heavens until its
just another point of light in the star-speckled sky

An ENERGETIC MUSIC CUE kicks in as we CUT TO --

EXT SPACE - NIGHT

The star capsule RACES through the cosmos AHEAD a WORMHOLE
forms The ship PUNCHES THROUGH --

A BRILLIANT FLASH OF IMAGES

FLASH Adam at high school graduation Bonnie and Tommy wave
enthusiastically from the stands

FLASH Adam exchanges vows with JR Tommy is his best man
FLASH Adam hits the Streif swooping through a mean-looking
half-pipe working the balance board like a pro with a style

all his own

Focus on an ELDERLY MAN cheering from the crowds Pride
fills his eyes which sparkle and shine With specks of
green

FADE OUT

THE END
