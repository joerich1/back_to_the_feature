INT COLLEGE REGISTRATION -- DAY 1

At the edge of the registration hall three well-dressed young

women -- stylish black ROSE cute insipid HEATHER and
pretty VIOLET -- spot a lonely-looking new student
ROSE
Look
VIOLET
Where
ROSE
There
VIOLET

Yes I think so

Violet approaches the lithe pretty but sad-looking LILY

VIOLET (CONTD)
Hello Are you a new student

LILY
Yes

VIOLET
Good -- we thought so We’d like
to help you

LILY
Help me What do you mean

EXT QUADRANGLE -- DAY 2

The four walk across the green leafy quadrangle formed by
the university’s handsome old brick buildings

INSERT TITLE “The Quadrangle Seven Oaks University”

VIOLET
As a freshman it can be very
tough You finally get to college
it’s supposed to be so great but
generally -- it’s not University
life can be pretty bad

HEATHER
There are a lot of suicides

ROSE
Well attempted ones

LILY
I’m not actually a freshman I’m a
transfer student
VIOLET

Oh An “entering Sophomore”
LILY

Yes
VIOLET

So you were unhappy at your old
school and are looking to recover
here Well I think you will

Violet encourages her with a huge smile

A pause

HEATHER
Yes

VIOLET
Would you welcome that Would our
help and guidance be something
youd appreciate or would you
rather sink or swim on your own
Either way’s fine we’d still be
friends

HEATHER
Yes whichever youd prefer

LILY
Yes Sure

VIOLET
Great Well let’s start
immediately

She gives Lily a very quick looking over

VIOLET (CONTD)
Clothes can be critical for
confidence -- and an overall sense
of well-being

LILY
You don’t like my clothes

VIOLET
It’s not about liking or not
liking

LILY
What’s it about

VIOLET
How you look when you put them on
HEATHER
The right clothes don’t have to be
expensive

ROSE
No all you need are friends of
about the same size

A grungy pack of male students approaches inconsiderately
hogging the path obliging the girls to step aside Suddenly
Rose looks like she’s smelled something foul Violet gags

VIOLET

Phew

Rose bends over hyperventilating -- it’s a bit scary

LILY

What’s wrong
VIOLET

You didn’t notice that
LILY

No what
VIOLET

Those guys That smell That
awful acrid odor

Rose’s hyperventilating gets a little less Film full
speech in both locations

VIOLET (CONTD)
Rose has a very sensitive nose

INT GIRLS’ ROOM -- DAY 3
Rose lies in her bunk a handkerchief to her nose

VIOLET
--Have you heard of “nasal shock
syndrome” Any harsh acrid or
just “disgusting” odor sends Rose
into nasal shock--

ROSE
(very nasally)
This wasn’t true nasal shock Had
it been I’d’ve lost consciousness
entirely

LILY
(smiles)
Just from some bo
VIOLET
“Just some bo” Omigod Lily
you must have a very high threshold
for pain That’1ll serve you well
here at Seven Oaks

LILY
What do you mean

VIOLET
Seven Oaks is notorious for it’s
bo It was the last of the “Select
Seven” to go co-ed

(looks around combative

An atmosphere of male barbarism
predominates -- but we’re going to
change all that

HEATHER
Yes

Lily heads toward the door

VIOLET
Where’re you going

LILY
I’ve got to get to the housing
department -- it seems they lost my
rooming assignment

VIOLET
That’s terrible You’ve no place
to stay

Lily shakes her head her eyes watering a little

VIOLET (CONTD)
They lost your housing assignment

ROSE
How could they lose it

HEATHER
Was it just mislaid

LILY
No there were more acceptances
than they anticipated and not
enough rooms to go around

Violet exchanges quick looks with Rose and Heather

VIOLET
Why don’t you stay with us

LILY
Really
INT DORM BATHROOM-- NIGHT 4

Considerable movement in front of the mirrors as the girls
prepare for a night out

VIOLET
You mustn’t think of this in the
old fashioned sense of going to a
party to “find someone” or “not
find someone” That’s not the
dynamic we’re talking about

LILY
What dynamic are you talking about

VIOLET
I’m glad you asked that Our going
to a party of this kind is more a

form of “youth outreach”--
LILY

Of what
VIOLET

“Youth outreach” It’s not just
some moronic frat house social

function--

ROSE
Though it will be that

VIOLET
Yes of course but what we’ve got
to keep in mind is -- these guys
are very young they’re “young

people”--

Violet opens the door and goes halfway out with one parting
comment

VIOLET (CONTD)
They’re essentially immature
crying out for help and guidance

She leaves

ROSE
Though they don’t know that

HEATHER
No They don’t but we do

LILY
But aren’t they the same age as we
are
ROSE
Only numerically

Violet returns carrying a beautiful dress
VIOLET
I’m a lot fatter than you are but I
think we could pin it

LILY
Omigosh it’s beautiful

ROSE
Stunning

Lily puts the dress up to see how it looks in the mirror

TITLE CARD
Saturday Evening “Youth Outreach”

EXT UNIVERSITY WALK -- NIGHT

Possible POV shot of a wooden frat clubhouse from which party

music and crowd spills Girls could walk into POV or we

just see them heading that way

VIOLET
Take Frank my friend -- he’s not
some cool handsome “studly” macho-
type No not at all -- I can’t

stand guys like that He’s more of
a sad-sack really wouldn’t you
say

Rose and Heather nod

ROSE
Definitely

LILY
What’s a “sad-sack”

ROSE
(forcefully)
A loo-ser

LILY
(to Violet)
You like losers

VIOLET
Very much so Do you know what’s
the major problem in contemporary
social life
LILY
What

VIOLET
The tendency very widespread to
always seek someone “cooler” than
yourself -- it’s always a stretch
often a big stretch Why not find
someone who’s frankly inferior

HEATHER
Someone like Frank

VIOLET
Yes It’s more rewarding and in
fact quite reassuring

LILY
You mean someone you can really
help Not just thinking of
yourself

VIOLET

Yes That’s it Precisely But
without the goody-goody
implications -- our aspirations are
pretty basic Take a guy who hasn’t
realized his full potential or
doesn’t even have much and then
help him realize it -- or find
more There’s enough material here
for a lifetime of social work

Looking ahead they see the front verandah of the D U where a
drunken frat member walks toward its balustrade and
dramatically falls front-flipping over it and disappears
from view He then stands and walks calmly back into the
club

ON the girls Lily’s shocked expression the others’
equanimity

VIOLET (CONTD)
What’s really worrisome is that
that-—-
(she makes a face)
-- was intentional

The girls pass through the frame toward the clubhouse

INT DU CLUBHOUSE -- NIGHT 6

Entering it’s instantly clear the girls greatly outclass the
DU guys a “meatloaf crowd” that includes Violet’s FRANK
VIOLET
Frank this is Lily she’s just
come to Seven Oaks as a transfer
student Isn’t she great

FRANK
Uh

VIOLET
Lily failed or was unhappy at her
last school but we’re sure is going
to adapt beautifully here In fact
she already has

FRANK
Oh Good

A good quite recent (circa-20026) dance hit starts to play

VIOLET
Omigod -- a “golden oldie” I love
these

Violet starts the dancing they all join in

INT DU CLUBHOUSE PARTY SPACE -- NIGHT 7

The four pair off and dance enthusiastically with klutzy DU
partners -- Violet with Frank etc Later women arrivals look
on jealously Violet tries out new cool dance steps -- the
others follow suit The dancing gets better Even the DU
guys -- most sad-sacks but one THOR dumb and handsome --
rise to the occasion

INT DU CLUBHOUSE REFRESHMENT AREA -- NIGHT 8

Breaking from the dancing Violet leads them into the
refreshment area

VIOLET
Omigosh Wasn’t that great
LILY
That was really fun
FRANK
Yeah
VIOLET

I know that people can have useful
careers in many areas Government
Law Finance --

ROSE
--Education--
VIOLET
Yes even education But I’d like
to do something especially
significant in my lifetime the
sort of thing that could change the
course of human history -- such as
starting a new dance craze

LILY
Really

VIOLET
Yes Something that could improve
the lives of every person -- and

every couple

Frank looks at Violet with pride which Violet rewards with a
quick kiss before sampling the punch

VIOLET (CONTD)
My gosh that’s good What’s in it

The young bartender gets flustered with an “uh” “duh”
reaction -- he doesn’t know

VIOLET (CONTD)
No don’t tell It’s better a
mystery

INT DINING HALL -- DAY 9

At breakfast the four are in pretty good shape considering
the night before

VIOLET
I’m so proud of what you
accomplished last night You
showed those guys a really good
time without anything really bad
happening You could see their
confidence and enjoyment increase
by the minute while not letting
them turn into animals That’s
good

ROSE
Still I hate it when they puke

Violet thinks about this

VIOLET
That’s okay It’s part of growing
up -- “they’re learning their

limits”
ROSE
But are they learning It’s like a
puking festival

VIOLET
Well their aim’s improving
They’re getting more directional

HEATHER
Yuck I hate when it gets on your
clothes

VIOLET
Dar-fur

LILY
What

VIOLET

Dar-fur There are horrible
injustices in the world and we
shouldn’t obsess over the
adolescent misdemeanors of friends

LILY
The guys you know are they all
Greeks

VIOLET
What

LILY
Are all the guys you know Greeks

VIOLET
Excuse me I don’t understand

LILY
(more slowly)
Are All The Guys You Know
Greeks

Violet looks to the others

VIOLET

I don’t think we know any Greeks
ROSE

Professor Papadapoulos
LILY

“Greeks” -- frat boys

Blank looks all around

VIOLET
Oh Oh Yes Fraternities You mean
members of Greek-letter
fraternities -- American college
slang “Greeks”

LILY
Like last night
A pause
VIOLET
Actually last night we were at the
4p “yg” house “p “U uw Roman
letters not Greek Seven Oaks
doesn’t have a Greek letter
fraternity system -- it’s always
been a Roman letter system here
HEATHER
It’s very different
LILY
How
VIOLET
Well I think youll see
10 EXT BRICK BUILDING -- DAY

They approach another Georgian brick building
Heather carry a large box of donuts and “jug 0’ joe”

LILY
What house is this
VIOLET
Oh this isn’t a fraternity -- at

least not one anyone should want to
join

The sign reads “Suicide Center”

Rose and

Violet picks up the “Prevention” from the Center’s sign from

the floor

VIOLET (CONTD)

(to Lily)
You probably think we’re frivolous
empty-headed perfume-obsessed
college coeds You’re probably
right I often feel empty headed--

Violet puts the “Prevention” sign back up

VIOLET (CONTD)

But we’re also trying to make a
difference in people’s lives And
one way to do that is to stop them
from killing themselves

Violet and Lily climb the Center steps

VIOLET (CONTD)
Have you ever heard the expression
“Prevention is nine-tenths the
cure” Well in the case of
suicide it’s actually ten-tenths
the cure

LILY
Those are cliches aren’t they

INT SUICIDE CENTER -- DAY 11

While Heather and Rose set up the coffee and donuts for the
center including the sign explaining their restricted use

VIOLET
Yes they are It’s interesting
that you say that I love cliches
and hackneyed expressions of every
kind Do you know why

Lily shakes her head “no”

VIOLET (CONTD)
Because they’re largely true The
hundreds perhaps thousands of such
cliches and hackneyed expressions
our language has bequeathed to us
are in fact a treasure-trove of
human insight and understanding

LILY
Really

VIOLET

Yes Oh come sit with us During
these formative college years we
should try to learn as many
hackneyed thoughts and expressions

as possible -- furthermore I think
we will
HEATHER
(to Lily)

Speaking of suicide prevention do
you have a boyfriend Lily

Lily is a bit amazed

ROSE
Are you dating anyone

LILY
I don’t see the connection
HEATHER
You don’t

VIOLET
Boyfriends are a primary suicide
risk

HEATHER

You don’t have any particular
friend No one at all

Lily is put on the spot

LILY
No Well there’s this grad
student whom I met over the summer -
- Xavier pronounce Zav-ee-yay We
became pretty good pals

VIOLET
“Good pals” What’s that

LILY
Well he has a girlfriend whom I
met -- she’s very nice

Violet looks around to the others

VIOLET

What’s the point of that
LILY

Of what
VIOLET

Xavier with the girlfriend

LILY
What do you mean

HEATHER
“Zavier with a “Z

LILY
No I think it’s with an “XxX”

HEATHER
No I’m certain it’s a “Z
“Zavier Like “Zorro” It’s the
same sound
(does a Zorro move)
Zorro marked his name with a “Z”

LILY
It’s an “X”

HEATHER
But Zorro’s with a “Z It’s the
same

VIOLET

Okay let’s see if we can figure
this out Used at the beginning of
a name “Z and “X” have the same
pronunciation

HEATHER
But it’s Zorro- with a “Z”

VIOLET
Actually there were two “Zorros”
One spelt his name with a “Z and
made a “Z mark for Zorro the
other one spelled him name with an
“X and with his sword he’d make an
“X mark What was really unfair
was that because he marked his
name with an “X” everybody assumed
he was illiterate when actually he
was spelling correctly

A frantic seeming young male student bursts into the Center --
they all stop what they’re doing

VIOLET (CONTD)

Hello
ROSE
Can we help you
VIOLET
Of course we can No case is too
hard or challenging -- would you

like a donut

Heather springs into action

ROSE
Please sit down

HEATHER
Here have some coffee

Violet sits at the desk and takes out a form

JIMBO
Thank you

VIOLET
What’s your name

JIMBO
Jim Bose But my friends call me
Jimbo

VIOLET
Why

JIMBO
What

VIOLET
Why do your friends call you
“Jimbo”

JIMBO

I suppose it’s a contraction of
“Jim” and the first part of my last
name “Bose”

VIOLET
Yah I got that But why bother
JIMBO
What do you mean
VIOLET
Why bother “Jim” is already a
lovely name -- short simple
evocative -- shouldn’t a nickname

simplify the name that it’s
replacing Jimbo’ doesn’t simplify
anything

JIMBO
I don’t know

VIOLET
Well maybe you should ask your
friends what they had in mind
(reading from form)
Where do you live or reside

JIMBO
Doar Dorm

ROSE
Ouf

HEATHER
Omigod Yuck

JIMBO
What

VIOLET

The smell It’s notorious
JIMBO
What smell

VIOLET
Youre right it’s more like a
“stink” Unclean clothing Id say

mostly

ROSE
Vomit

HEATHER
Stale beer

ROSE

Pot cheap deodorant -- there might
be a vermin infestation

Heather and Lily place the coffee and donut next to

VIOLET
No wonder you’re depressed living
there Did you know that a good
smelling environment is crucial to
our well-being Have you thought of
moving and finding a place that
smells better--

JIMBO
(getting frantic)
Wait wait wait-- It’s not me --
I’m not depressed

VIOLET
Are you sure Because you kind of
seem on edge

JIMBO
No -- I’m fine
ROSE
That’s a terrible expression --

“fine”

(a funny voice)
“Im fine”

(normal voice)
Anyone who says they’re fine
definitely isn’t It’s kind of
conceited Something smug about
it

VIOLET

Why do you say you’re “fine”

JIMBO
I mean I’m not depressed I’m not
suicidal

him

Violet snatches the donut from his mouth

ROSE
Why are you here then Are you a
con man a confidence trickster

JIMBO
No there’s a girl on my floor Her
boyfriend dumped her She’s been
crying for days but now’s silent--

VIOLET
Omigod Why didn’t you say so

Violet jumps up

VIOLET (CONTD)
We have to go
(to the others)
Call the cops -- a suicide might be
in progress

Violet heads off

HEATHER
The campus cops

ROSE
Yes of course the campus cops
EXT WALK TO DOAR DORM -- DAY 12
They head quickly along the walk Violet still holds the
partially eaten donut carefully and sanitarily with a thin

tissue

VIOLET
Take this I’m sorry--

Violet gives Jimbo his donut back

VIOLET (CONTD)
It’s just that we get a lot of
students coming to the center
pretending to be depressed to get
the donuts

ROSE
Confidence tricksters

VIOLET
Yes it’s really bad really
cynical And we made a pledge the
donut company that we would only
give the donuts to students who
were depressed suicidal or

otherwise nutty We’re a non-profit
-- so the rules are pretty strict

Jimbo nods as he jogs his mouth full

ROSE
This man could still be a
trickster

VIOLET
We’ll soon find out I’m
surprised we haven’t had more cases
from Doar Dorm -- living in such
squalor must be terribly
destabilizing psychologically

JIMBO
It’s not so bad

VIOLET
You poor guy Tell me about
this girl

JIMBO
Her name’s “Priss” She’s very
pretty--

VIOLET
Oh yeah--
(to the other girls)
--it’s very hard for beautiful
women to experience rejection

INT DOAR DORM CORRIDOR -- DAY 13

They are outside the girl’s room Violet tests the door
handle It’s locked She shakes it

VIOLET
Priss Priss Are you okay

They listen but can hear nothing

VIOLET (CONTD)
Priss Say something

Meanwhile each reacts to the Doar Dorm odor most gasping but
Rose spraying perfume on her pashmina and trying to breath
through that

VIOLET (CONTD)
Priss Open up -- please Priss

She listens but there’s no sound from within Rose
approaches Violet looking unwell

ROSE
(in terrible shape)
Could I wait outside
VIOLET
Yes It’s best to get as far away
as possible
Rose who looks shaken nods

VIOLET (CONT’D)
Take care of yourself Rose

HEATHER
Yes take care of yourself

Rose leaves protecting her face with the pashmina

VIOLET
Priss say something Please--

Campus cops arrive

VIOLET (CONTD)
Oh thank God we’re going to have
to force this door

14 INT DORM ROOM -- DAY 14
The campus cops burst into the room -- followed by Violet and
the others PRISS bolts up from her dorm cot where shed
been lying teary-eyed head under a pillow headphones in her

ears She’s delicate-looking and very pretty

VIOLET
Priss Are you okay

Priss takes the headphones out of her ears

PRISS
What

VIOLET
Please don’t-- Please please--
Come with us
15 INT COFFEE COTTAGE -- DAY 15

Violet and Jimbo sit with Priss who nurses a hot chocolate

VIOLET
But you had contemplated suicide

PRISS
What

VIOLET

Had you resolved to kill yourself
PRISS

No Not really

She stops looks down and freezes Silently tears start
streaming down her face Violet turns to Jimbo

VIOLET
Could you excuse us

Jimbo nods and goes Violet turns back to Priss

VIOLET (CONTD)
Do you want to talk about it What
was his name

PRISS
J-josh

Priss’s voice breaks another wave of tears rolls down her
cheeks

VIOLET
If youd rather not talk about it
we don’t have to --

Priss nods but the tears don’t stop

PRISS
No it’s Okay I just I keep
thinking how he used to gaze at
me with such love in his eyes --
you know what I mean

VIOLET
No I’ve never actually seen that

PRISS
Yes just days ago he’d gaze at me -
- with his eyes so blue

She stops the tears roll some more

VIOLET
He had blue eyes

Priss nods

VIOLET (CONTD)
So does Frank -- Frank’s the guy
that I go out with Otherwise he’s
not conventionally good-looking --
which I actually prefer Would you
describe “Josh” as handsome

Priss nods too overwhelmed to talk further

VIOLET (CONT’D)
That’s a problem

Lily comes by with a cup of tea

LILY
Could I join you guys

VIOLET
Yes please Priss and I were just
talking -- in my view handsome men

are to be avoided I don’t even
consider good looks to be
flattering in aman Do you know
what I mean

LILY
Uh no

VIOLET
Cookie-cutter “good-looking guys”
with their “chiseled features”
running around full of themselves
getting everything they want never
suffering or experiencing any--

LILY
Have we suffered

VIOLET
Were not under discussion-- That’s
irrelevant beside the point
(to Priss)
Is this making you feel any better

Priss has stopped crying

PRISS
Yes I think so

VIOLET

Good I hoped it would

(checks her phone)
Okay it’s nearly four and the
Daily Complainer’s orientation
meeting is about to start I think
we should go The editor Rick
DeWolfe he’s terrible a real
jerk

16 EXT QUADRANGLE - DAY 16

The Fab Four plus Priss walk toward the “Daily Complainer”
building
LILY
Why do you think he’s such a jerk

VIOLET
Environment Genetics

LILY
I mean what’s he done that’s so
jerky

VIOLET
Oh You’ll see He’s one of those
I was talking about -- tall
probably considering himself very
smart and handsome -- and a
“journalist” -- so you can just
imagine the mind-boggling arrogance
and conceit

LILY

But Violet don’t you think
VIOLET

What
LILY

Well don’t you think that the way
you talk be considered arrogant
too

They walk in silence for a moment

LILY (CONTD)
I mean a little

VIOLET
Yes of course but what’s your
point

LILY

Wellwouldn’t that be
hypocritical criticizing Rick
DeWolfe for something you could be
criticized for yourself

Violet considers this with complete equanimity

VIOLET

No I don’t see why We’re all
flawed Must that render us mute
to the flaws of others Must we
tether ourselves from comment
because our natures are human too

(very happy)
Weve got a rebel amongst us
That’s good I think It’s good to
be challenged and criticized

LILY
I’m sorry I know your intentions
are good--

VIOLET

Youve put your finger on something
important That’s it precisely
Our intentions are good We’re
seeking to help people rescue their
lives from terrible sadness and
failure -- which is a worthy goal
don’t you think

LILY
Yes but not exactly a humble one

VIOLET
No I agree with you there you’re
right absolutely I’d like to
thank you for this chastisement

LILY
I’m sorry I didn’t mean to--

VIOLET
No I think you did and I think
it’s good It’s good to have a
friend to put one in one’s place
when that’s what one needs and now
I see that I have that kind of
friend in you I think that’s
great

17 INT DAILY COMPLAINER NEWSROOM -- DAY 17

Tall insufferable RICK DeWOLFE jumps up on a steel desk to
address the young freshman and sophomore crowd

RICK DE WOLFE

Hello people Listen up
People Quiet Quiet people
Shut up Okay thats better
Ha ha Im Rick DeWolfe editor
of the Complainer Over the next
weeks and months I’m the person
youll learn to hate most in the
world At least I hope so
(laughs)
You’re going hate me because I’m
going to work you relentlessly

oint out your stupidity and
incompetence do everything in my
power to turn you into journalists -
- albeit barely literate ones

Nervous laughter from the crowd

VIOLET
Oh brother

LILY
What

Violet just shakes her head but Rick looks and sees Violet’s
contemptuous stare A Ceausescu moment Then he recovers

RICK DE WOLFE
Any questions No

Stupid titters Violet rolls her eyes

MALE STUDENT
Uh yes -- how did the “Daily
Complainer” get its name

RICK DE WOLFE
Isn’t that pretty obvious

The student embarrassed shakes his head nervous titters
from the crowd

RICK DE WOLFE (CONT’D)
It comes out every day and it’s the
university daily-- So the Daily
Complainer Daily--

Stupid laughter from Rick and others

MALE STUDENT
No I meant--

RICK DE WOLFE
You mean why the “Complainer” The
name dates from Seven Oak’s
earliest days as a divinity school
The reference is to the Book of Job
-- Jobs “complaint” with the
world The Complainer started as a
theological journal but evolved
into the university weekly finally
going daily after World War Two I
like the name -- before justice can
be achieved a complaint must be
made That’s what we do and people
don’t like it a bit Right now that
means extirpating Seven Oak’s
elitist roman-letter clubs that are
like a cancer on the university
community--

VIOLET
Oh what nonsense

RICK DE WOLFE
What
VIOLET
Theyre not “elitist” in the least

Dead silence in the room

RICK
Of course they are

VIOLET
Have you met any of their members
The guys from the DU for example
They’re morons barely competent
for the tasks of everyday life
They have to drink something like a
quart of beer just to talk to a
woman-—

ROSE
Two quarts

VIOLET

Yet you salivate at the idea of
taking the roof off these poor
guys’ heads and throwing them
brutally into the street where who
knows what harm might come to them
And you consider yourself a
Christian

RICK
No I don’t

VIOLET
What unkindness and cruelty -- and
yet you’re proud of that This is
the darkness in human nature in
the very Heart of Man -- which the
British novelist Joseph Conrad
wrote about most eloquently

RICK
He was actually Polish

VIOLET
Omigod Pedantic too Unkind
self-righteous and pedantic -- in

short a model journalist
Rick looks around and appeals to the crowd

RICK
You should know something about
these girls -- they run the
“Suicide Center” where their
preferred therapy for seriously
depressed and suicidal people is
tap dancing I kid you not

VIOLET
Tap is a highly effective therapy
as well as a dazzlingly expressive
dance form that has been sadly
neglected for too many years

RICK
It’s moronic and barbaric You
seriously expect tap dancing to
solve these people’s problems

VIOLET
No we don’t -- we’re using the
whole range of musical dance
numbers which over many years have
proven themselves to be effective
therapies for the suicidal and
hopelessly depressed

INT GIRLS’ ROOM -- NIGHT

Violet lies on her bunk looking discouraged while the
others relax or go about their business

VIOLET

That really got me down
LILY

I thought you handled it well
VIOLET

You did Thanks No it’s all
this aggression and hostility that

gets me down -- not just his but
also my own It leaves you feeling
unclean

HEATHER

Have you thought of taking a shower
maybe you’d fee better

VIOLET
Youre probably right but there’s
something else What Lily was
saying about me being conceited and
arrogant--

LILY
I’m sorry--

VIOLET
No I think you’re right It’s
bad I feel terrible

ROSE
Youre joking--

VIOLET
No I’m serious It’s terrible how
I’ve acted I’m embarrassed
We’re all Christians -- Or I
should say “Judeo-Christians”
humility should be our watchword
the essence of being a good person
The question is how do you become
humble if you’re essentially
arrogant and evil by nature

The room falls into silence

INT SUICIDE CENTER -- DAY

A gangly oddly-dressed male student awkwardly leads sad-

seeming students

if from a 30s musical Look for music

VIOLET
Very good Freak

GANGLY STUDENT
You really think so

VIOLET
Yes Certainly

Lily takes Violet aside

“FREAK ASTAIRE” -- the gangly student -- notices them
talking

LILY
(whispering)
Is it really such a good idea to
call him “freak”

VIOLET
What

LILY
He’s already depressed constantly
calling him “freak”--

VIOLET
(whispers back)
That’s his name “Freak” -- “Freak

Astaire” that’s how he wants to be
called

FREAK
(a bit paranoid)
What’s all the whispering What
are you talking about

including Priss in a tap dance number as
VIOLET
Lily was just saying that she likes
your dancing

Freak nods Next to them DEBBIE a chorus member seems
catatonic

VIOLET (CONTD)
Are you okay

DEBBIE
(suspiciously)
What do you mean

VIOLET
I just noticed that you looked a
little sad and I was wondering if
there’s anything we could do

DEBBIE
What could you do Oh I know you
think I’m suicidal -- that I’m
going to kill myself and make you
look bad

VIOLET

No I’m worried you’ll kill
yourself and make yourself look
bad

DEBBIE

Do you have you any idea how
demoralizing it is to be constantly
questioned about whether you’re
suicidal or not

VIOLET
No

DEBBIE
Well the first few times you
might brush it aside by saying “No”
or “Not now”

(Increasingly angry)

-But after a while you begin to
wonder -- why is everyone asking me
this Is it because they want me to
be suicidal Or is it just the
unintended consequence of their
utter absurdity

Debbie turns and walks away Violet follows her
VIOLET

Excuse me what scent are you
wearing

DEBBIE
What are you talking about

VIOLET
The perfume that you’re wearing

DEBBIE
I’m not wearing any perfume

VIOLET
You see that could be the problem

INT XAVIERS HOUSE KITCHEN -- EVENING 20

The kitchen in the ground floor apartment in a private house
Lily’s grad student friend XAVIER and his girlfriend ALICE in
the midst of preparing a healthy-looking meal

LILY
I’ve become friends with this
really nice group

XAVIER
Reall

Yeah -- though they’re somewhat
perfume-obsessed

XAVIER
Oh them -- those girls The ones
who volunteer at the Suicide
Center

LILY
Yeah

XAVIER
But they’re terrible The blonde
one -- she’s notorious

LILY

What do you mean

XAVIER
Such a bitch terrible isn’t she

ALICE
(preparing the salad)
Would balsamic be okay

LILY
What

ALICE
Balsamic vinegar for the dressing

LILY
Oh yeah sure

Lily follows their movements as they prepare the meal

Xavier lifts a lid revealing three artichokes in
steam

LILY (CONT’D)
What’s that

XAVIER
What

LILY
Those

XAVIER
Artichokes

LILY

Is that what they look like

ALICE
Oh come on Lily You’ve seen an
artichoke before

Lily is embarrassed for a moment

ALICE (CONT’D)
You haven’t

LILY
They look so weird Like little
Martian space vehicles

Xavier laughs

EXT QUADRANGLE -- DAY
The girls leaving the Suicide Center with Priss

VIOLET
You know I’m not convinced that
having a “Suicide Prevention
Center” prevents any suicides

ROSE
Well the coffee’s good

LILY
If someone were really determined
to destroy themselves I don’t
think they’d stop for coffee

a cloud of

HEATHER
I suppose it depends on what it
tastes like

LILY
Where are we going

VIOLET
I thought I’d take Priss over to
the DU

LILY
Why

VIOLET
Well it might be helpful for her
to meet some of the guys

LILY
How would that be helpful They’re
morons

VIOLET

Come on Lily
LILY

No they are They’re morons
VIOLET

No Not medically I like them

Theyre in that sympathetic range
of being not good-looking and yet
not smart There’s something
likeable about that Spending time
with them you get the sense that
youre really making a difference
in their lives For somebody
suicidal like Priss that could be
a real boost

PRISS
I’m not suicidal

VIOLET
Oh Thats good Its better not
to have the identity as a suicidal
person don’t you think

Lily heads down a divergent path

LILY
Bye

VIOLET
(worried)
Where’re you going

LILY
Over to Xaviers

VIOLET
Is that a good idea

LILY
Why wouldn’t it be

VIOLET
Is his girlfriend going to be
there

LILY
Of course -- gosh you’re nosy

VIOLET
No -- no nose Just a general
foreboding

LILY
“Foreboding”

Violet reconsiders

VIOLET
You know you’re absolutely right
I was being nosy terribly so I’ve
got to watch that Please forgive
me I want to become a better
person Can one Can one change
one’s nature I don’t know But I
feel we must try

HEATHER
Yes we must improve ourselves

LILY
Bye

DAMSELS
Bye
EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET -—- DAY 22

In the golden light of the day’s end Lily approaches Xaviers
house A guy on a bike passes her

XAVIER
Lily

Xavier stops

XAVIER (CONTD)
You were coming over

Lily surprised nods Xavier gets off his bike

LILY
Yeah is Alice home
XAVIER
Alice is working
LILY
Oh she is
XAVIER
But it’s not a problem -- it’s good

you came Let’s go to the Oak Bar
Ill buy you a beer

Lily hesitates

LILY

I thought Alice would be back
XAVIER

I’ll call her She’1l join us

there

Lily hesitates further

INT THE CORNER BAR —- DAY

Xavier and Lily installed at a booth talk as the tavern
starts to fill up with local and student crowds

LILY
She’s actually quite a good person
I mean her entire identity
revolves around helping people

XAVIER
You really think that’s true For
instance what’s she have against
the Complainer That’s bizarre

LILY
Well she thinks the editor Rick
DeWolfe is completely egotistical

XAVIER
And your friend isn’t

ALICE
Hi

Xavier stands to let Alice by him into the booth

LILY
Hey

ALICE
Hi Lily

XAVIER
Hi Great You got the message

ALICE
Yeah thanks So who’s
egotistical

XAVIER
Lily’s roommate She sounds
unbearable She’s on a rampage
against the Complainer

ALICE
Really Why

LILY
She thinks the editor Rick
DeWolfe is conceited and in fact
quite mean

ALICE
Mean

LILY
Yes he wants to close Seven Oaks’
Roman-letter clubs

ALICE
That’s good isn’t it I thought
everyone was against them

LILY
No

XAVIER
Come on There’s no possible
justification for those places
Theyre exclusive and elitist

LILY

The point that Violet makes is that
they can’t be elitist they’re
morons

XAVIER
Yeah -- elitist morons

Confounded for a second Lily regroups

LILY

But you’ll grant that they’re
morons and that’s a handicap --
such people should be helped not
hounded and persecuted

XAVIER
(with a laugh)
Persecuted

LILY
Yes Losing the roof over your
head being thrown out into the
street that’s about the worst
thing that can happen to anyone

Xavier shrugs cruelly indifferent

LILY (CONTD)
Violet thinks that there could be
some risk of suicide

XAVIER
Oh because some moronic frat boy
might kill himself Seven Oaks
can’t do what’s right

LILY
It’s a factor to be taken into
consideration

ALICE
Yeah

XAVIER
No it isn’t You can’t set policy
that way

The barman arrives with a new round of drinks

XAVIER (CONT’D)
Excuse me we didn’t order these--

BARMAN
Compliments of the guy at the bar

They look to the bar where a well-dressed fairly young guy
nods to them Lily looks at him intently -- while he’s not
handsome there’s something appealing about him

INT GIRLS’ ROOM -- DAY 24
Lily paces as the girls lounge in the room

ROSE
That’s a playboy or oper-a-tor
move Oper-a-tors like that are to
be avoided

VIOLET
Why It seems very generous to me -
- sending a round of drinks over to
people he didn’t know Drinks are
expensive

ROSE
Sending drinks to two gorgeous
girls His intention was to seduce
-- and he assumed he could

HEATHER
(shocked)
Both

VIOLET
Isn’t that a bit harsh He was
probably just yearning for some
intelligent discourse

ROSE
I doubt that was the course he was
seeking

VIOLET
Was he alone
LILY
Yes
VIOLET
You see -- he was alone and

probably lonely He could see that
Alice and Lily are college
students College students are
well known for their intelligent
conversation After all they can
always talk about their courses
That was probably what attracted
him--

ROSE
Nonsense

VIOLET
Perhaps his view was even loftier --
to court Lily with a view to
matrimony We’re in the North but
occasionally a Southern gentleman
can wander into these parts

ROSE
Rubbish

VIOLET
Why not Seeing Lily across a
crowded bar filled with the usual
undergraduate slobs why wouldn’t a
thoughtful young man seek her out
Shes lovely Isn’t it incumbent
on men and women to find ways to
meet each other Buying drinks for

a person you don’t know seems to me
to be a particularly generous one

HEATHER
Yes most guys won’t even pay for
the women they do know

ROSE
What you’ve described is a playboy
or oper-a-tor move

VIOLET
I’ll grant you it’s a tactic or
perhaps even a ruse But without
some of that would our species
even survive The Lord said “Be
fruitful and multiply--”

LILY
Omigosh--

VIOLET
No this is how the world works --
“seeing someone across a room” —-
this could be a great romantic
story to tell your grandchildren

Violet imagines this

VIOLET (CONT’D)
And if you do marry and have
children then he’1ll learn how to
really squander cash Isn’t it
good to know he’s basically
generous from the start

HEATHER
Where’s Priss
25 INT BAR LOUNGE DU CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT 25

Priss sits with Frank as a DU brother THOR makes drinks

PRISS
Your eyes are so striking so blue
FRANK
Really They’re blue
PRISS
Yes The most piercing blue
FRANK
Huhn
PRISS

You must know that your eyes are
blue
FRANK
No
PRISS
(laughs)
What do you mean
FRANK
What
PRISS
You must know what color your eyes
are

Frank remains silent and impassive

PRISS (CONT’D)
Come on your eyes are very blue
you know that

FRANK
I’m not going to go around
“checking” what color my eyes
are

At the bar Thor cocks his head listening
PRISS

Yes but-- When you look ina
mirror you must see your eyes are

blue

FRANK
Oh come on

PRISS
What

FRANK

I’m not homo-phobic but I’m not
going to go looking in mirrors
checking to see what color my eyes
are I don’t think my eyes have
a color If they were so blue
looking out wouldn’t everything be
kind of blue Like have a blue
tinge or something

(looks around)
Doesn’t Just looks normal

Thor handing them drinks takes a look at Frank’s eyes

THOR
That’s blue That color

PRISS
Yes Of course

THOR
Then what color is that

He points to a leather chair that’s clearly green

PRISS
Green

THOR
Youre saying that chair’s green
but Frank’s eyes are blue

PRISS
Yes
THOR
And was color are the walls
PRISS
Also green
THOR
Huhn
PRISS
You don’t know that
THOR
No
PRISS

How is that possible

THOR
You really think knowing the colors
is so so important

PRISS
Youre in college and you don’t
know colors Doesn’t that
embarrass you

THOR
No Why should it That’s why the
‘rents are paying big bucks to send
me here -- you know to learn
stuff

Thor toasts them taking a sip from his drink
THOR (CONTD)
Thanks Well gotta go hit the
books

Thor heads off then stops

THOR (CONTD)
I don’t know about you but I don’t
think anyone should feel
embarrassed about not knowing
stuff What’s embarrassing is
pretending to know what you don’t --
or putting other people down just
because you think they don’t know
as much as you I’m happy to admit
I’m completely ignorant That’s why
I’m here and plan to really hit the
books So the next time you see
me I’1l1 know more than I do now
Ill be older but also wiser -- or
at least know more stuff For me
that’s education

Thor salutes them with his drink

THOR (CONTD)
Cheers

Thor takes a long draught before leaving Priss and Frank
watch Thor go

FRANK
Thor’s great He’s very clear about
his objectives he really wants to
learn things -- that’s why he’s
here Like you always see him with
a book and yet he’s not pretentious
in the least

INT ELSEWHERE DU HOUSE -- NIGHT 26

The lights are low Some cool music is on The camera

embrace Their kiss goes on and on

doorway shocked Violet turns and flees the others follow

nothing without you

Tears have started rolling down Violet’s face

I love him

28 INT GIRLS’ ROOM -- DAY 28
The next day they’re still talking -- Violet prostrate abed

LILY
Come on Violet Frank’s a moron
You’re well rid of him

VIOLET
Don’t say that

LILY
What Frank’s not a moron

VIOLET
You know Lily you’re a bit harsh
This obsession with “intelligence” -
- do you think it has some magical
quality transforming everything
The intelligence line is not an
immutable barrier love can cross
it You can love someone whose
mental capacity is not large I
know I have

LILY
Well there’s a mutable barrier
then

ROSE
Frank’s stupid we knew That he
was a rat jerk playboy op-er-a-tor
I hadn’t realized

VIOLET
I don’t want to turn bitter I
worry for Frank -- I care about
him
LILY
Well I’d stop
VIOLET
No I love Frank -- I always will
HEATHER

If that’s the case why not fight
for him

VIOLET
What do you mean

HEATHER
Get him back

LILY
No He’s worthless

VIOLET
Against Priss I’d never win

HEATHER
Sure you would

VIOLET
Priss who’s so pretty and sweet

ROSE
Priss is a rat A bitch A rat-
bitch

VIOLET

Don’t blame Priss She was crushed
when her blue-eyed Josh left her

(smiles a little crazily)
I should have known Of course
shed fall for Frank Josh and
Frank are both blue-eyed
heartbreakers

Lily looks at Violet as if she were completely delusional

HEATHER
I wonder if people with blue eyes
are in fact less kind than other
people Blue eyes could represent
an icy nature

LILY
Your eyes are blue

HEATHER
I know and I’m often shocked at
how cold I am I’m like an icicle
inside I don’t feel a thing

confident and constructive

LILY
Yeah -- but now she’s a wreck
But there’s no logic to the algebra
of love

CHARLIE
“The Algebra of Love”
(smiles)
That sounds like the title to some
lame book

LILY
Well it’s a title but the book’s
not lame at all

CHARLIE
Love’s “algebra” I always thought
it was more geometry

LILY
Okay the title’s not good but the
book is

CHARLIE

What’s it say
44

LILY
Well that while we’re all
perverse in our romantic
preferences there’s actually this
logic or algebra to our
perversity It has something to do
with how the species has evolved

CHARLIE
The survival of the species

LILY

Yes and whether it will continue
to do so

30 INT THE CORNER BAR -- NIGHT 30

Lily drains a martini glass and puts it down next to an empty

so mean

Violet’s post-jilt pain

ROSE
Are you sure he was mean

HEATHER
Sounds as if he was just trying to
protect you

ROSE
This Charlie Walker sounds like an
oper-a-tor a “playboy” type

LILY
He’s not like that at all he’s
actually a really nice guy

camera also observes

ROSE
I thought he was a slick
businessman

LILY
No he dresses well but he works in
strategic development

ROSE
What

LILY
“Strategic Development” -- he works
at “SDA” -- Strategic
Development Associates He’s an
associate there

What he is is a “strategic oper-a-
tor”

There is no response -- just the sound of water
LILY

The girls exchange concerned looks Violet gets out of the

shower wrapped in a towel

Violet listless in her movements is slow to reply
VIOLET

INT SUICIDE CENTER -- DAY

Debbie and Freak practice dance Jimbo quizzes Violet for the

questionnaire

DEBBIE
Shell say anything to get in the
show I suppose now she’1ll want the
donuts too--

JIMBO
You don’t have to be suicidal to
get the donuts just “severely
depressed”

DEBBIE
No “clinically depressed” -- from
a clinic

JIMBO

(to Violet)
Would you say that you’re
depressed

VIOLET
I don’t like the term “depressed” --
I prefer to say that I’m ina
tailspin

DEBBIE
Omigod A “tail spin” She can’t
even say she’s “depressed” like
everyone else -- she’s got to say
something “special” Priss was
honest she was really depressed
and she had a right to be in the
show Now every silly tail-spinner
is trying to get in

FREAK
The show’s for everyone

DEBBIE
No it isn’t Freak To be
included in the Center’s programs
you have to be “clinically
depressed” That means that you’ve
been to a clinic -- and they’ve
said that you’re depressed Have
you been to a clinic

Violet doesn’t reply

DEBBIE (CONTD)
Have you been to a clinic

Violet shakes her head “no”
DEBBIE (CONT’D)
Then you’re not “clinically
depressed”

Heather arrives with a large tray of donuts and cardboard
coffee jug as Violet leaves the building

should be back by now

Rose turns to Heather

ROSE
How did she seem when you last saw
her
HEATHER
Really sad about Frank
LILY
Still
Heather nods
HEATHER
Yeah
LILY

I’m beginning to wonder about
Violet How can someone so smart
continue mooning over a dope like
that

ROSE
From what I’ve observed in my
admittedly brief span on earth
people generally don’t jump for joy
after being dumped by the moronic
jerk in whom they’ve invested all
their hopes and dreams

LILY

But Violet’s so great how could
she go berserk over an idiot like
that

ROSE

People aren’t exactly as you
assume The Violet you know bears
little resemblance to the girl I
met Seventh Grade year--

LILY

You met Violet in Seventh Grade
ROSE

Well her name wasn’t “Violet”

then

A “wavy” memory dissolve begins as Rose thinks back

GIRL 2

INT GIRLS’ ROOM -- NIGHT

Present day

LILY
“Tweeter” Like a bird
ROSE
Yes -- not an easy name to have at
that age
LILY
Not at any age What was she like
ROSE
Timid bookish classic
scholarship student -- her parents

were writers They didn’t have a
dime Finances were the least of
her worries

LILY
What do you mean
ROSE
Well she was crazy -- I got stuck

rooming with her on the class trip
when no one else would Ouf it
was awful

HEATHER
She smelled bad

ROSE
No Obsessive cleanliness was part
of her insanity

HEATHER
But you were nice to her
ROSE
No not really -- the idea of being

nice to weird and unpopular kids
hadnt arrived then

LILY
Why was she so unpopular

ROSE
She was very strange -- constantly
setting herself odd repetitive
tasks--

LILY
Tasks

ROSE

For example on that trip she had
with her a little square suitcase
The idea came into her head she had
to move it in a precise pattern
over and over again

Images of young “Emily” attempting this as a young “Rose”
watches expression agape

ROSE (CONT’D)
If she didn’t execute this exact
movement flawlessly ten times --
shed start over from scratch

Looks from the others

ROSE (CONTD)
Another was to slide her hand
across her forehead trying not to
touch her hair or her eyebrows on
either side --

(Rose demonstrates)

-- also repeating it ten times Any
niggling thought she touched a hair
on either side she’d start over

LILY
My God that’s insane

HEATHER
Why would she do that

ROSE
Well it was a compulsion
44n

LILY
What compelled her

ROSE
She had the superstitious
conviction that if she didn’t
complete these tasks flawlessly --
her parents would die

HEATHER
Was she Catholic

ROSE
No But what made the whole thing
really sad was that her parents did

die

Suicides They come down from the
university Jump out in the road
to get hit by the blind curve--

HIGHWAY WORKER 2
Hope you’re not one of them

VIOLET
Do I look like one of them

HIGHWAY WORKER 2
I don’t know Maybe

HIGHWAY WORKER 1
Messy people suicides Think only
of themselves and their own deaths -
- not what comes after

HIGHWAY WORKER 2
They make quite a mess but don’t
stick around to clean it up

CAROLINA
So you’re not one of those
depressed students down from the
university

VIOLET
Well I don’t really like the word
“depressed” I prefer to say that
I’m in a tailspin

CAROLINA
A Tail Spin

SHARISE a young black waitress coming on duty takes an
interest

SHARISE
Does this Tail Spin involve a Man

VIOLET
Yes It does But I’m not as
crazy as I was up to yesterday
Partly that’s due to the salutary
effect of scent on the human
psyche It’s importance is I
believe almost incalculable At
the motel this morning I happened
to use this bar of soap--

Violet shows the soap in a see-through plastic zip-lock bag

VIOLET (CONTD)
It was provided me as a courtesy as
one of its guests -- that an
economical motel would provide such
good soap is quite unusual The
scent is very precise

SHARISE
Really

Sharise leans forward Violet cradles the soap in the palm
of her hand

VIOLET
Tell me if it provokes any
particular reaction in your psyche -
- a state of mind

Sharise and Carolina then the highway workers all inhale
its scent -- then look thoughtful

INTEXT MONTAGE 48

Heather runs toward her

HEATHER (CONT’D)
Youre back You’re okay

VIOLET

A campus police Mini pulls up and a cop jumps out

HEATHER
Omigosh Violet -- we were so
worried why didn’t you tell us or
at least leave a note

VIOLET
I did leave a note

CAMPUS COP
Would that be a suicide note

INT GIRLS’ ROOM -- DAY 51

Violet looks under the desk and beds finds the note and
hands it to Heather

VIOLET

leaving a note

HEATHER
But where did you go

VIOLET
I took the commuter train to
Villafranca and checked into a
cheap motel there

ROSE
The Motel 6

VIOLET
No the Motel 4 it’s even less
expensive

ROSE
The Motel 4 in Villafranca - oh my
God you really were suicidal

HEATHER
But why’d you go

VIOLET
I had to do something

LILY
You really thought you were going
to find the answer to whatever you
were looking for in Villafranca

VIOLET
I’m not sure what I expected but I
think I might have found it

HEATHER
What

Violet looks in her bag and pulls out something which she
holds cupped in her hands

LILY
Soap

Violet bends over her cupped hands and inhales deeply
VIOLET
This scent -- and this soap -- is

what gives me hope

LILY
How

VIOLET
Ill tell you

INT XAVIER’S HOUSE -- DAY 53
LILY
Hello Hello Is anyone
here
Lily walks through the house -- it seems spare as if

furnishings have been removed A rhythmic sound comes from
somewhere in the apartment Passing the washer-dryer she sees

it’s the agitated spin cycle She gets to the kitchen and

puts the bag down on the counter

XAVIER (0S)
Hello

LILY
Omigosh I couldn’t understand
where everyone was

XAVIER
Sorry I just went out to get some
things

He puts another bag of groceries on the counter

LILY
Where’s Alice

XAVIER

better to tell you in person

LILY

Really What was she jealous of
XAVIER

Oh come on
LILY

No what

XAVIER
You After a while I just couldn’t
handle it -- things became
impossible
LILY
She was jealous of me
XAVIER
Of course
INT LIVING ROOM XAVIER’S HOUSE -- EVENING 55

The coffee table has been set with two places and low
candles Lily brings in their plates as Xavier looks through
some dvds

XAVIER
Would it be okay if we watch a
film

LILY

Yes what would you like to see

XAVIER
I thought maybe Truffaut’s
“Baisers Voles” “Stolen Kisses”
Do you know it

LILY
No is it new

Xavier shakes his head

XAVIER
It’s a classic of French New Wave
cinema -- I think you’ll like it

Xavier puts the dvd on and reaches for the wine

LILY
But it’s in color

XAVIER
Yeah

Xavier pours them two glasses of wine -- Lily watches
TIGHT ON red wine pouring into a glass

XAVIER (CONT’D)
You don’t know Truffaut

LILY
No

XAVIER
Do you know Godard “A Bout
Souffle”
EXTINT LIVING ROOM XAVIERS HOUSE -- NIGHT 56

INT GIRLS’ ROOM -- DAY 57

Heather paces Lily and Rose study Violet examining the
contents of a small case

HEATHER
Why was Alice so jealous

Lily just looks thoughtful continuing studying

ROSE
What do you think -- she was
jealous because Lily’s absolutely
lovely

LILY

I don’t know -- apparently they had
a lot of problems

ROSE
Of course You wouldn’t break up a
happy couple

Violet is studying a piece of paper she’s taken from the box

HEATHER
What’s that
VIOLET
A note Frank left
HEATHER
Really Recently
VIOLET
No -- when we were together Now

that most correspondence is
electronic it’s very rare to be
left with anything written by hand

ROSE
Frank can write by hand What is
it

VIOLET
It’s not very important but -- it’s
just all I have

LILY
What’s it say

Heather taking a look reads it

HEATHER
“Out for brewskis -- back in a
gif”

LILY

What’s a “gif”

HEATHER
It’s one of those little motor
scooters isn’t it

VIOLET
I’m sure he meant to write “jiff”
with a “j” -- “back in a jiff”
LILY

But he wrote “gif”

HEATHER
Could Frank be dyslexic

ROSE
No Dyslexics are intelligent

Violet handles a little leather-covered ball from the box

HEATHER
What’s that

VIOLET
Frank’s bean-ball

HEATHER
He gave you his bean-ball

VIOLET
Not exactly This is an extra --
he thought he’d leave it here just
in case he lost his other one

LILY
How thoughtful

ROSE
That’s all Frank gave you a bean-
ball

VIOLET
Relationships aren’t about
presents

ROSE

They aren’t

LILY
Gosh Violet you’ve really got to
stop thinking about Frank

VIOLET
Why I don’t want to stop thinking
about him Recently I had a
thought that cheered me up a lot
-Life is like a long flowing
river and as a long flowing river
some debris you never expect to see
again is almost certain to
reappear floating to the
surface Frank and I may very
well be together again one day
Maybe it’ll take many years but
somewhere down the line he is
very likely to pop up again -- and
I’ll be there to catch him

INT XAVIER’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 58

Great music plays lots of candles providing flickering
illumination The camera snoops down the hallway to the
kitchen where there are a few dishes left from a dinner a
deux to the living room where Lily and Xavier smooch on the
couch their clothes undone Xavier slightly disentangles
himself enough to talk

XAVIER
There’s something I wanna
He stops
LILY
I’m ready
Xavier smiles
XAVIER
I don’t think we’ve spoken about
this--
LILY
What
XAVIER

It’s nothing bad Have you ever
been to the South of France -- for
example to the walled city of
Carcassonne

LILY
I’ve never been anywhere

XAVIER
But you’ve seen pictures of it

LILY
Uh No I don’t think so

He shows her a postcard of Carcassonne

LILY (CONTD)
It’s fascinating I’d like to visit
it

XAVIER
So you never studied the Cathars

Lily shakes her head

XAVIER (CONTD)
They were a religious movement
very idealistic located mostly in
the south of France that the
Catholic Church and the royal
authorities cruelly repressed The
“crusades” were not directed solely
against the Moslems there was also
one against the Cathars

LILY
Really Why

XAVIER
Cathar beliefs and way of life
threatened the Catholic Church and
the political authorities of that
time Catharism was branded a
heresy and brutally repressed

LILY
Omigod the Catholic Church is
like always bad

Xavier nods

XAVIER
Ideas can’t be killed as easily as
people -- especially such

enlightened ones as the Cathars
held In recent years more and more
people have returned to their
beliefs

LILY
So you’re a Cathar

XAVIER
Yes I aspire to be I’m trying to
follow the path the Cathars marked

out

LILY
That’s so impressive I can tell
you -- we didn’t have any Cathars
back home

XAVIER

I think youd be surprised

INT BATHROOM -- NIGHT 59

Lily washing her hands checking herself in the mirror

INT XAVIERS HOUSE -- NIGHT 60

Xavier goes between the bedroom and living room lighting
candles and rearranging things placing a lotion near the
bed adjusting the music Lily coming out walks into
Xavier’s arms Xavier leads her to the bed where they
continue kissing finally coming up for air

XAVIER
Cathars dissent radically from
Catholic teaching regarding
procreative sex--

LILY
I should hope so

XAVIER
In the Cathar view the highest form
of love-making avoids procreation
entirely

Lily laughs a little embarrassed

A pause

LILY
Sure -- condoms right

XAVIER
Well according to Cathar ideas
sex with condoms is just a parody
of the procreative act

LILY
What do you mean

XAVIER
The standard cliche form of
sexual intercourse is for the man
to approach the woman from
“the front” In Cathar love-making
-- which I think you’1l find very
fulfilling -- it’s from the other
side

LILY
From the other side

XAVIER
Yes

Xavier kisses her tenderly and continues in a near whisper
XAVIER (CONTD)
Ill be very careful we’ll go
slowly It’1ll be a new experience
for you but one which I think
youll find brings an inexpressible
closeness

They continue kissing

EXT XAVIERS HOUSE -- NIGHT TO DAY 61

Lily looking around shakes her head
HEATHER
Do you still see him at all

LILY
Yeah he calls from time to time

HEATHER
He does Why don’t you invite him
over and introduce us

Lily smiles

LILY
Why should I introduce you
HEATHER
Well because you know him -- and
we don’t
LILY
So
VIOLET

“So” “So” is probably the
unkindest word in the English
language I can’t bear it It
should be outlawed “So”

LILY
Youre crazy

HEATHER
Come on Lily you have Xavier
You cant keep two guys for
yourself

LILY
Guys do that all the time

ROSE
We’re not “guys” fortunately

HEATHER
It’s unconscionable for you not to
bring him around and introduce us

LILY
Charlie’s a friend He’s a nice

guy

ROSE
What do you mean

LILY
I just hate to think what would
happen if one of you got her claws
into him

ROSE

That’s outrageous We’re
perfectly nice people We’ve met a
lot of pathetic guys and nothing
very bad’s happened

cannister

soon
Rose groans
LILY

What’s that

HEATHER
A festival Seven Oaks’ Roman-letter
clubs put on

ROSE
A kind of moron jamboree

VIOLET
I wish I could say the Roman
Holidays were a celebration of the
best in classical learning
education architecture philosophy
-- with poems in the style of
Juvenal and recreations of

historic events such as Cato’s
defense at the bridge But alas
it’s --

ROSE
A moron jamboree

VIOLET
The only Roman elements will be
worship of Bacchus Beerus and
Blotto and it’s such a shame
because it could all have been so
uplifting and improving

Charlie Walker not wearing a suit enters the
spots him

Charlie stops in his tracks and turns to her

Hey What are you doing here

Charlie pauses for thought

LILY (CONT’D)
Have you the day off

CHARLIE
Uh yes
LILY
This is my friend -- Charlie --

whom I think I’ve mentioned
Charlie these are my roommates --
this is Rose this is Heather and
Violet Charlie works at Strategic
Development Associates -- he’s an
Associate there

VIOLET
You work in Strategic Development

CHARLIE
Youve heard of it

VIOLET
Of course yes My cousin Jay in
Philadelphia works in Strategic
Development

ROSE
“Stra-tegic Devel-op-ment” What
is that

cafe

Lily
CHARLIE
Well in contradistinction to short-
term or “tactical development” --
“strategic development” is planning
for the long term

HEATHER
Oh

ROSE
Something bus-i-ness related

CHARLIE
Mostly business but any kind of
organization

LILY
But only businesses pay the big
bucks

CHARLIE
Actually non-profits and
government pay well too

ROSE
I suppose that’s how they keep from
having profits -- by paying lots of
money to companies like yours

VIOLET
Excuse me -- aren’t you in
Professor Ryan’s course at the Ed
School

CHARLIE
Uh no

VIOLET
Youre not in Professor Ryan’s
“Flit Lit” course

Great to see you

Charlie heads off

Bye God Violet what was that
about

VIOLET

That guy’s definitely in Professor
Ryan’s class

LILY
That’s not possible -- he’s got a
full-time job at Strategic
Development Associates

ROSE
He never got his coffee

The girls consider this significant detail

Violet keeps looking intently in Charlie’s direction

CLOSE ON

LILY
Why would he lie about something
like that

VIOLET
He’s lying I find that very
attractive

HEATHER
What are you going to do

VIOLET

I’m going to stop cutting Professor
Ryan’s class

A GIRL’S HAND WRITING COURSE NOTES--

INT LECTURE HALL -- DAY

Violet listening intently to Prof Ryan taking notes

PROF RYAN
It can be argued that Firbank was
too little disciplined too
unserious in his unseriousness to
create works of enduring value
But as a liberating influence on
later writers such as Waugh his
importance should not be
discounted It’s not Firbank’s
work itself but the idea of his
work that so helped later writers --

as Thomas Love Peacock did in the
previous century

While Prof Ryan speaks Violet perched high in the
amphitheater looks around She catches a glimpse of someone
resembling Charlie but in drab campus wear slouched down
among friends his face not visible

EXT LECTURE HALL -- DAY 70

The Charlie-type hurries off with his friends as if oblivious
to Violet’s presence

So did you finish it

INT COFFEE COTTAGE - DAY 71

Violet and Charlie sit at a table
VIOLET
Well you were lying

CHARLIEFRED
I wasn’t lying I was making it
up

VIOLET
Why were you making it up

CHARLIE
(looks around whispers)
If you were an eighth year Ed
School student would you advertise
that

VIOLET
Eighth year impressive But your
whole life was a lie -- dressing up

in suits buying people drinks

CHARLIE
No the suits -- were real The
drinks -- real And I wasn’t just
buying drinks for “people” -- they

were for cute girls there was a
perfectly rational logical easily-
explainable agenda

VIOLET
So it was a playboy or oper-a-tor
move

CHARLIE
Of course Transparently so

VIOLET
I admire that -- drinks are
expensive But “Strategic
Development” -- that was made up
too

CHARLIE
I thought you said your cousin Jay
was working in it

VIOLET
What cousin Jay

CHARLIE
Cousin Jay in Philadelphia

VIOLET
Oh I don’t have any cousin in
Philadelphia

CHARLIE
You said your Cousin Jay in
Philadelphia was working in
Strategic Development

VIOLET
I was just saying that to be
friendly -- to make a kind of
link So your name’s Fred

insane -- and I almost dated him
HEATHER
You can say that about a lot of
guys
VIOLET

I don’t think he’s crazy

LILY

Making up an entirely fictitious
identity That’s not crazy It’s
insane psycho weird

HEATHER
Violet’s identity is made up I
don’t think she’s crazy

VIOLET
No I am

LILY
This is different It’s
pathetic All that about
“strategic development” he just
made up -- don’t tell me that’s not
weird

HEATHER
I’m sure I’ve heard of “Strategic
development” -- I think it’s
something pretty important

LILY
Omigod Violet you’re not going to
start going out with him
(watching her face)
You’re not are you

VIOLET
Well we had planned to go to the
library

LILY
Not to the stacks I hope

Violet nods

VIOLET
Yes

LILY
Omigosh do you realize how
dangerous that is

VIOLET
Dangerous
LILY
Yes The stacks -- they’re dark

Fred shows her - a book of Walter Pater’s

VIOLET (CONTD)
Have you chosen a topic for your
final paper

FRED
Uh “The Decline of Decadence”

VIOLET
You think decadence has declined

FRED
Definitely Big time Major
major decline

VIOLET
How

FRED
“How” or “in what ways”

Violet shrugs and shakes her head

VIOLET
Either

FRED
Okay take the flit movement in
literature or homosexuality It’s
gone completely downhill Right
down the tubes

He makes the sound “Whchht”

VIOLET
What do you mean

FRED
Before homosexuality was something
refined hidden sublimated
aspiring to the highest levels of
creativity and expression and often
achieving them Now it just seems
to be a lot of muscle-bound morons
running around in T-shirts

Violet looks a little shocked

FRED (CONTD)
It’s pretty disillusioning

Violet pauses in thought for a long moment

VIOLET
Are you gay

FRED
Not especially but in another era
it might of had some appeal Now
I just don’t see the point

VIOLET
I think you might be romanticizing
the past

FRED
We’ll never know The past is
gone -- so we might as well
romanticize it

VIOLET

Hunh You could be right
FRED

I wanted to ask how’s Lily

Check it out The ALA have you

heard of it We have a meeting on

So a fellow was passing these out
on the street and invited us to a
meeting on Tuesday

XAVIER
The “ALA” -- oh my God

LILY
I thought it was something related

XAVIER
Youre kidding

Lily small voice intimidated

LILY
No
XAVIER
“The ALA” “The Anal Love

Association” What do we have to
do with that

Lily looks down at the brochure again

XAVIER (CONT’D)
You haven’t understood any of what
weve talked about

LILY
Talked about

XAVIER
The ALA has nothing to do with
us Can’t you see that

Xavier sighs heavily and walks away then returns

XAVIER (CONTD)
The way we express love has
meaning it’s in the context of
something beautiful We’re
following our Creator’s teaching
aspiring to an ideal -- a beautiful
one that brings an inexpressible
closeness not just to each other
but to--

He grabs the brochure

XAVIER (CONTD)

For the ALA and those like them
the love-act is just hedonistic
pleasure-seeking of a perverted
nature -- there are words for
people like that I can’t
believe you’d think we had anything
in common with them We don’t
nothing not an iota

Lily stares back at him

EXT XAVIER’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 77

You don’t understand what
JIMBO

What is ‘non-procreative love-

making’
VIOLET

Well it could be a lot of things
JIMBO

Uh yeah -- but in this case

FRED
We don’t have to talk about this--

LILY
No I don’t mind

JIMBO
Could somebody just explain to me
what this is all about
VIOLET
Well what it is isuh--

LILY
Because Cathars don’t believe in
procreative sex they don’t have
intercourse the usual way

JIMBO
The usual way

A brief awkward pause

FRED
You don’t have to talk about this
LILY
No it’s okay Yes the normal way
from the front -- where you can
have procreation -- not from the

other side where you can’t
A light goes on in Jimbo’s head

JIMBO
The other side That’s their
religion

LILY
Not exactly but that’s the
direction their beliefs head in --
when they want to express love
that’s what they do

JIMBO
And you liked that

FRED
Come on

LILY

It got pretty uncomfortable

JIMBO
So it started out comfortable and
got uncomfortable later

FRED
Man Do we have to talk about
this

I don’t know

Of course Priss What a bitch
Oh man That whole thing --

“Tm so stressed sad depressed

sleep or something She was so
depressed she had to get everything
her own way--

(mimicking her)
Im so stressed -- frantic Man
What A Bitch

VIOLET
Priss dumped you

FRANK
No It was mutual

Frank goes silent again then remembers something
FRANK (CONT’D)
Listen I have a question do you
remember that bean ball I left in
your room

Violet nods

VIOLET
Yeah

FRANK
Do you still have it

VIOLET
Yeah

FRANK

Do you think I could get it back
I lost the other one and with
everything thats happened Id
really like to have it

VIOLET
(cheerfully)
Nothing like some bean ball after a
break up

FRANK
Yeah God you’re smart You always
get it Whatever I say you
understand Man

Violet stalks out and heads at a fast pace towards the
university Fred comes out and catches up to her

FRED
Violet what’s wrong

She won’t say anything and just keeps walking

I’m sorry Lily is lovely I can
understand why you would be
attracted to her Now she’s free
Go I understand

Roman Holidays

OMINOUS SENTENTIOUS MUSIC SUCH AS ‘THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA ’

EXT DU CLUBHOUSE GARDEN - DAY 89

Late afternoon Roman Holidays party scene at the DU --
toga towel and sheet-clad “Romans” booze it up while bad
rock blares The courtyard has been set up as a coliseum --
an inebriated semi-dressed gladiator with a rubber sword
staggers forward and spouting idiot Latin charges a Golden
Lab disguised as a lion

GLADIATOR
Aunque utque Latin Et cetera

Charging the Gladiator falls on his face before reaching the
dog who licks his face

ROSE (0S)
This is what comes from not
teaching Latin in the schools

EXT ADJACENT LAWN -- DAY 90

The girls (minus Lily) elegantly dressed in plausibly Roman
style watch Violet though still sad comments indulgently

VIOLET
Yah it’s moronic and boorish but
also kind of fun don’t you think

ROSE
No

They look back as a roar rises from the DU crowd

EXT DU CLUBHOUSE - DAY 91

A chariot race has begun predominantly razor scooters and
skate boards As the course extends outside the courtyard
the “lion” takes off

ROSE (ON and OFF)
The art and thought of the
classical age were the glory of
civilization These are nothing but

moronic fraternity high jinx -- not
improving or uplifting in the
least

There are some smash-ups as the race descends into a
spectacle of drunkenness and hopeless chaos

EXT ADJACENT LAWN -- DAY 92

Suddenly Rose looks faint and gasps placing her hand over
her face

ROSE
Oh no -- what’s that stench

Rose gags as if about to wretch From the girls’ right comes
another roar they turn to see

EXT DOAR DORM -- DAY 93

A horde of “barbarians” charges from Doar Dorm with
animalistic shouts and calls their dress and demeanor filthy
and frightening like something out of BRAVEHEART though in
college wear The barbarians rush the short distance to the
DU grounds Immediately a full melee breaks out

EXT ADJACENT LAWN -- DAY 94

VIOLET
I suppose this is what happens when
decadence rots society from within--

HEATHER
And from with out

VIOLET
And not the interesting decadence
of former times but the moronic
kind you get today
She nods toward the on-going melee
VIOLET (CONTD)
Such a society is I fear destined
to fail and be overrun
Rose hands over her nose winces from the barbarian smell

ROSE
Maybe that’s good

They watch more melee as the scene fades the fighting sounds
and wails of wounded Romans continuing over BLACK

THER

You and Viole

it’s nice you’re still very

attractive --

but are also sensible

and moralistic I don’t I have
narrow hips but also no very
strong principles

There’s a knock on the door

VIOLET

Yes

Violet goes to the door glancing through the peephole before

opening it

VIOLET (CONTD)
Oh hi

Frank strolls in

HEATHER
Hi Frank

FRANK
Hi Heather -- wow
(to Lily)
I guess you guys all heard -- the
university is closing all the Roman-
letter houses

VIOLET
I’m sorry -- it’s terrible This
year’s Roman Holidays did seem like
the end of civilization -- but even

when civilization ends people are
going to need a place to stay

FRANK
Man it’s bad It’s that bastard
from the Complainer Apparently
someone from the administration has
been reading it -- hard to believe
Bastard Listen we were wondering
if you thought it’d be okay if we
stayed at the Suicide Center until
we find somewhere else to go

Violet looks to the others

VIOLET
Okay sure -- that sounds like a
good stopgap measure

FRANK
Thank you thank you There
was uh one more thing -- you
remember that bean ball we talked
about

VIOLET
Yes

FRANK

Do you think I could pick that up
After everything thats happened I
could really use it right now

VIOLET
Yes

Violet goes to find it Frank following As she opens the
box he notices the note in his handwriting
FRANK
What’s that

VIOLET
What

FRANK
That note

VIOLET
Oh One gets so few things written
by hand anymore I guess I kept
it

FRANK
Hunh

Frank picks up the note and reads it aloud

FRANK (CONTD)
Out for brewskies - back in a Gif
hard “g What’s a “Gif” The
scooter like a Vespa right

HEATHER
That’s what I thought

FRANK
I was thinking of getting one

Frank looks to Heather with appreciation

VIOLET
You must have meant “jiff” “Back
in a jiff” and then misspelled it
or spelled it in a non-standard
way

FRANK
Oh yeah Not a good speller

Frank throws the bean ball up in the air and catches it
rather skillfully

FRANK (CONTD)
Thanks You’re great Priss was

such a bitch Damn Damn
(leaving)

Hey Heather -- Bye
(to Rose)

Bye

HEATHER and ROSE
Bye

Violet steps out in the hall with Frank who corners her

Wow Heather is really cute She’s
like really attractive Is she
uh going out with anyone

The Ed School -- “Robertson Hall”
102 EXT QUADRANGLE -- DAY 96A

Rose walks with Violet who’s obviously quite upset and
overwrought

VIOLET
I can’t bear this tension with
Lily It’s terrible to have the
group divided this way

Rose looks up and guides Violet away from the path alongside
Robertson Hall

ROSE

Better not next to Robertson
VIOLET

What
ROSE

Didnt you hear Suicidal Ed
School students have been going up
to the roof and throwing themselves

off
VIOLET
But it’s only two stories--
ROSE
Yes I know it’s terrible -- not

high enough to kill but high enough
to maim and particularly dangerous
for anyone below

They head down the central path -- a safe distance away

VIOLET
Ive got to forget about Fred

ROSE
But you really liked him

VIOLET
This whole thing of a person
meeting someone else first it’s so
arbitrary it’s terrible and cruel -

She looks to Rose for support but only gets a blank look

VIOLET (CONTD)
-- especially when that selection
by “priority” is the opposite of
how things ought to be

ROSE
I have to say I was wrong about
Fred I thought he was a playboy
or oper-a-tor type In fact he’s
just another guy rendered helpless
by the attentions of a pretty girl

They are interrupted by a commotion shouts from nearby
Robertson Hall and a young woman following a young man across
its roof

ED SCHOOL GIRL
Cary Cary No Don’t I love
you

The young man looks over the balustrade and as the girl
approaches jumps -- out of frame Close on Rose and Violet
watching the sound of a slight “thud” in the distance then
a sharp squeal of pain

ED SCHOOL GUY (0OS)
Owwwww Owwwwww

ED SCHOOL GIRL
Why did you do that Carry I love
you

Rose and Violet resume walking

ROSE
Isnt the Ed School essentially a
teachers’ college

VIOLET
Yeah

ROSE
What concerns me is if they can’t
even destroy themselves how are
they going to teach America’s

Thor

97 INT GIRLS’ ROOM -- NIGHT 97

It’s quiet the lights off Violet Rose and Heather in their
bunks

HEATHER
I’m really worried about Thor
It’s hard for us to imagine how
upsetting it is not knowing what
the colors are

ROSE
In fact it’s impossible for me to
imagine

HEATHER
When Thor sees a rainbow -- it’s

only so much gibberish to him
There was one this afternoon
omigosh he took it hard Recently
there was a parade in the cit
where the marchers carried rainbow-
colored flags and banners --- Thor
was so upset he said he’d no idea
what it meant --

ROSE
What kind of retard is he

HEATHER
See that’s the conclusion people
immediately jump to

VIOLET
Well it’s somewhat understandable

HEATHER
Not if you knew the full story

ROSE
What’s the full story

HEATHER
You know how parents love bragging
about how precocious their children
are Thor’s parents had become
precocity-addicts constantly
needing an ever-greater precocity
“fix” When he should have entered
kindergarten they instead pushed
him into First Grade “Oh Thor
skipped a grade” they could tell
their friends most of whom were
terrible precocity-addicts too

ROSE
(suddenly alarmed)
What’s this all about

HEATHER
What Thor’s parents failed to
consider was the enormously
important academic work done in
nursery school -- key being the
study of colors which in Thor’s
case were -- a complete blank Can
you imagine I don’t want to be
too critical of Thor’s parents I
suppose they just assumed that
colors are the sort of knowledge
people pick up along the way --
like for example not stepping on
sidewalk cracks

There’s an odd sound

HEATHER (CONT’D)
What’s that

VIOLET
(whispers )
I think Rose’s sleeping

A silence except for the sound of Rose’s breathing

HEATHER
Am I boring

VIOLET
No not at all When you’ve
problems yourself it’s great to
hear someone else’s truly idiotic
ones Please go on

A shocked pause

HEATHER
Wow

VIOLET
What

HEATHER

When you said that about depressed
people being mean you weren’t

joking

VIOLET
I’m sorry -- you’re right Please
go on

HEATHER

No
VIOLET
I’m sorry You know how I am
Please continue

On Heather’s face as she struggles with her resentment

HEATHER
Thor decided he absolutely had to
learn all the colors both primary
and mixed He’s been hitting the
books really hard and thought he
had finally mastered them Then in
town today he said “that traffic
light’s blue” I had to say no
it’s green He was really upset
Hed been so sure it was blue

VIOLET
The traffic lights in town are sort
of blue

HEATHER
This was a green light --“cross at

the green not in-between”

VIOLET
Yah we call them “green” but
they’re actually more bluish

HEATHER
“Bluish” but still green

VIOLET
No they can be blue I know it
sounds strange but--

HEATHER
Huhn I don’t know about that
Frankly it’s hard to believe
Anyway we continued walking and a
naval officer passed us Thor
blurted out a bit aggressively
“his uniform’s black” I had to
correct him Navy uniforms are
blue “navy blue” -- that’s why
they’re called that way Omigosh
he was upset It was as if he were
going to cry

Rose awakes a little alarmed

VIOLET
You know actually that’s true
navy uniforms are black

HEATHER
They’re navy blue That’s the
color’s name

VIOLET

No by mistake the Navy received a
huge shipment of fabric that was
black not blue So as not to
waste it they decided to sew gold
braid on and use it -- and found
that everyone assumed it was blue
navy blue when it was in fact

black
HEATHER
Still Navy uniforms are still
black
VIOLET
Yes -- I believe so

In the dark Heather gets out of bed and starts looking around
for her clothes and dressing

VIOLET (CONT’D)
What’s wrong

HEATHER
Ive got to tell Thor There’s no
telling what he might do
The door opens and someone enters from outside

HEATHER (CONT’D)
Whos that

VIOLET

Oh hi Lily

INT SUICIDE CENTER -- DAY 98

Violet Rose Heather and other volunteers pack bars of the
“wonder” soap in oval cardboard packets Behind them
displaced DU members sleeping bags lying around lounge
play with bean balls etc

HEATHER
It’s getting to look like a
homeless shelter in here

VIOLET
These guys are not really
“homeless” -- they lost their

fraternity house It’d be better
to call them “house-less”

HEATHER
Okay It’s getting to look like a
house-less shelter then

Violet turns to some of the DU refugees

Frank and another approach

VIOLET
Hey could you guys help

back in his sleeping bag depressed and dejected)

FRANK
Sure what’s up

VIOLET
We need help packing this soap
which we’ll then distribute to Doar
Dorm residents

FRANK
Cool

VIOLET
What would you say are the most
effective means to fight
depression

Frank is completely stumped His DU brothers listen in
making faces

VIOLET (CONTD)
Maybe some of your DU brothers
have an idea

The DU guys think

DU GUY
Uh beer

FRANK
No -- beer’s a downer Cocktails --
hard liquor “spirits” -- is what

really gives you a lift

VIOLET
It’s interesting what you say My
Cousin Jay’s a medical officer in

(Thor in the background climbs

Philadelphia he says alcoholism --
by which I mean chronic excessive
consumption of alcohol -- is the
primary self-administered treatment
for depression

DU GUY
Cool

VIOLET
No Ultimately it leaves you much
worse off than before

DU GUY
Oh no not me I just boot and
then feel fine

VIOLET

By “boot” do you mean “vomit”
DU GUY

Yes
VIOLET

No none of the effective anti-
suicide treatments involve
vomiting

DU guy thinks

DU GUY
Hunh a treatment for depression
that doesn’t involve vomiting

FRANK
Uh -- hygiene

VIOLET
Exactly It’s very important
That’s why we have such hope in the
wonder bar Do you know its scent

They shake their heads Violet cups in the palms of her
hands and offers it up to them They inhale deeply -- and
are (somewhat) transported

FRANK
Wow
DU GUY
It’s guu--uud
VIOLET
Transformative we think
HEATHER
This is so exciting -- it’s

really great isn’t it

On Rose’s skeptical visage as she listens

HEATHER (CONTD)
I can just see those guys opening
the packages taking out the soap
smelling it and then excitedly
going to wash themselves For them
finally to be clean free from that
horrible acrid smell how different
the world might look to them

VIOLET
Yes

Violet looking around notices Thor lying prostrate in his
sleeping bag his head buried in his arms

VIOLET (CONTD)
What’s wrong with Thor

FRANK
I don’t know -- he asked me about
the weather When I told him it
looked “very gray” he looked
around -- and seemed really upset

Thor lies with his head buried under his arm

HEATHER
I better go to him

Heather heads toward where Thor is

FRANK
Thor’s gotten so worked up over
this color business My God it’s
weird Didn’t we all learn that
stuff in kindergarten

INT GIRLS’ ROOMHALL -- NIGHT 100

Violet studies at her desk then gets up as if taking a
break As she walks there’s a distinct clack sound She’s
wearing tap shoes walking delicately so as not to make too
much noise But the “clacks” are still pretty notable She
heads down the hall toward the bathroom -- suddenly a hall
door swings open and MAD MADGE leans out

MAD MADGE
What do you think you’re doing

VIOLET
Going to the bathroom

MAD MADGE
Making a racket like that
VIOLET
I’m sorry did I disturb you

MAD MADGE
What do you think Why are you
wearing tap shoes -- are you out of
your mind

VIOLET

Yes I think that’s clear
Quite a few others stick their heads out

MAD MADGE
Oh I’m so sick of that

POSITIVE POLLY
Oh really I think it’s cute

Madge gives Polly a dirty look

MAD MADGE
Since you won’t be treating us to
one of your hilariously incompetent
tap routines why don’t you take
those things off

VIOLET
No well do the routine Rose

Violet hurries back toward the room no longer trying to
soften her clacks

VIOLET (CONT’D)
Madge wants to see the routine

MAD MADGE
No --

Rose retreats within the room to put the music on

MAD MADGE (CONT’D)
--I don’t want to see your absurd
routine -- I asked you to take
those things off

POSITIVE POLLY
Please Madge please we need a
break--

VIOLET
Just briefly please it’s helpful
to have an audience-- Rose the
music

MADGE
I’m going to report you

“Things Are Looking Up” blasts from the stereo Violet
begins her dance down the hall -- it’s joyous and amazing
Rose appears with taps on and joins in Mad Madge slams

stairs their hall mates enjoy the spectacle

INT MR BLACK’S SEMINAR - DAY 101

MR BLACK
Susanne

COED
For me it’d be Madame Curie
Simone de Beauvoir and Margaret
Sanger

MR BLACK
Good Violet

VIOLET
I would say Richard Straus
Roderick Charleston and Chubbert
Checker

MR BLACK
(pronouncing)
“Rickard” Straus the composer

VIOLET
Yes -- that was one of his posts

MR BLACK
I’m not familiar with the others --
could you tell us who they are and
what links them

VIOLET
Yes

Violet swivels slightly to include the other students
speaking slowly for their benefit

VIOLET (CONTD)
Each one of these men started an
international dance craze --
“Rickard” Straus the Waltz
Roderick Charleston the
Charleston and Chubbert Checker
better known as “Chubby” the dance
we know as the Twist
MR BLACK
(smiling)
Why do you consider starting a
dance craze so important

VIOLET

(surprised)
Dance crazes enhance and elevate
the human experience bringing
together millions of people ina
joyous celebration of our God-given
faculties and passing these
delightful modes of physical
expression down through the
generations -- though not so much
any more

A pause

MR BLACK
I thought -- well I guess I
assumed that “the Charleston” was
named after the city of Charleston
South Carolina

Violet maintains a studied and level expression

VIOLET
No Though that misconception is
quite widely held It was Roderick
Charleston Usually behind some
great creative phenomenon is a
person not a town

103 INT SUICIDE CENTER -- DAY 103

Freak and Violet practice a song and dance version of “Things

Priss pops into the room and stands by observing Debbie in
the chorus notices Priss and stops as do others

DEBBIE

PRISS
Hi Debs

FREAK
Break

Freak stalks off Priss approaches Violet hesitantly
PRISS
Violet I am so sorry You must
hate me I know what I did was
wrong -- but if things ended so
easily between you and Frank isn’t
it best that they did so Isn’t it
better to break with someone so
unreliable

VIOLET
What

PRISS
What I’m saying is I know now I
should never have gotten involved
with anyone I was still on the
rebound from Josh But
inadvertently I did something that
you must acknowledge as positive
Aren’t you much better off being
rid of a numbskull like that

DEBBIE
Priss come on -- don’t apologize
to her Of course what you did was
right

PRISS
I know it sounds crazy but if I
did help you disentangle from
Frank isn’t that for the best
Frank was unworthy of you Violet --
you must know that Let’s be
honest he’s an idiot a moron
How would it have been your whole
life attached to a dope like that

FRANK (0S)
Priss

Priss turns Frank with some DU guys behind him
with a crushed look on his face

FRANK (CONT’D)

How can you say something like
that Priss I’m not a moron
I loved you

Well that wasn’t very bright of
you was it I was clearly on the
rebound

we go over there

ROSE
I don’t think there’s any rush

HEATHER
No Id like to go as soon as
possible Doar Dorm has the
university’s highest fatality rate
as well as the worst hygiene This
could really change things

LILY
The highest suicide rate

VIOLET
No the highest fatality rate --
it’s not certain what percentage
were intentional and how many just
due to a temporary unawareness of
gravity’s laws

HEATHER

I can just see those guys getting
the little gold packages opening
them and finding the terrificall
good-smelling soap inside Despite
their habitual reticence toward
hygiene the wonderful scent and
cute packaging should prove
irresistible And once clean
they’1l start to see the world with
new eyes The change could be
dramatic Doar Dorm could soon
become -- “Dior Dorm”

ROSE
I doubt that to be perfectly
absolutely honest

VIOLET

No I love the idea -- Dior Dorm I
adore optimism even when
completely absurd perhaps
especially then

HEATHER
Great Ready Let’s go

Lily runs up to fall in by Fred just as they turn the corner
and see Outside Doar Dorm and pouring out of its doors Doar
Dorm guys and a few Doar Dorm “women” throw small oval discs
back and forth in an enormous frisbee-like free for all One
of the discs falls at Violet’s feet it’s the oval package
they used for the Wonder Bar never opened The girls look
to each other appalled Two guys jump for the same disc
bashing into each other one dropping like a stone as if
dead

LILY
I guess it wasn’t realistic to
expect Doar Dorm to turn into “Dior

said without the soap the discs
wouldn’t fly properly

he’s not a playboy or oper-a-tor
type at all He’s a loser

VIOLET
I’m the biggest loser of anyone
First semester Forget Frank
Second semester Forget Fred

Have you forgotten him
Violet eyes watering shakes her head “no”

ROSE (CONTD)
I don’t think you should give up on
him

Rose spits the toothpaste into the sink

ROSE (CONT’D)
One thought reassures me Our
stupidity must be part of God’s
Divine Plan He must have made us
stupid for a reason

otherwise preoccupied

Very good news I was just at my

showered It was pretty clear
they’d used soap -- Omigosh what a
difference It seems they’d been
throwing the packages so
energetically a soap bar fell out --
the unfamiliar ivory-like object
intrigued them One thing led to
another and -- well it was just as

psycho-pharmaceuticals talk
therapy--
FRED
But are those approaches really so
effective Despite all the
medication and therapy Ed School
students are still throwing
themselves off Robertson Hall
Violet’s ideas might seem a little
off-beat--

LILY

A little off-beat Omigod I
don’t know how much you know about
Violet but there’s some pretty
weird stuff “Violet” “Violet
Wister” is not even her real name

FRED
It isn’t

LILY
No It’s “Emily Tweeter”
Apparently when she was eleven
years old she went completely crazy
and has had several relapses since
so it’s a little worrisome to have
her counsel nearly suicidal
individuals-

FRED
I can’t believe it
LILY
What
FRED
“Emily Tweeter” -- in First Grade I

had an enormous crush on a girl
with that name

LILY
You remember that

FRED
Yeah It was pretty huge Dr
Zhivago stuff Any idea or even
mention of her filled me with
emotion Admittedly I had a very
strange perspective on the world
then I don’t think my brain was
fully formed or functioning
properly -- everything was a bit of
a dream Then a bizarre thing
happened I was torn about whether
to shout my passion from the roof
tops or keep it secret In a sort
of compromise I wrote Emily’s name
in crayon on a scrap of paper
then carefully hid it in my
bookcase where no one else could
possibly find it So my secret
was expressed but ostensibly safe
-- Id no idea of the weird and
inexplicable events that would
follow

Lily looks a little worried

LILY
What

FRED
Two years afterwards I was walking
up the street a couple of blocks
from my house when I spotted a slip
of paper lying face up on the
sidewalk near someone’s trash --
the name “Emily Tweeter” written on
it in crayon in my own child-like
handwriting

He stares into Lily’s eyes with an expression of total
bafflement and candor

FRED (CONTD)
It was completely utterly weird
How could my secret so well
hidden come to land on the
sidewalk of Henderson Drive

Lily tries to help him

LILY
Could uh--

FRED
No I’ve thought long and hard
about it -- there’s no rational
explanation This was my first
encounter with the bizarre and
inexplicable When I later learned
about the Bermuda Triangle and
other such mysterious phenomena I
knew it was probably all true as
I’d had this early brush with the
uncanny From a very young age it
became clear to me that rationalism
cannot explain life’s deepest
mysteries

LILY
And you think this girl was Violet

FRED
I have to say I didn’t recognize
her She was very young then Do
you have any idea if Violet might
have attended Willamette
Montessori

LILY
In Portland

Fred nods The barman arrives with a tray of cocktails --
much to their surprise

FRED
We didn’t order these

BARMAN
Compliments of the guy at the bar

Lily and Fred look toward the bar -- Xavier wearing a suit
nods to them

INT THE CORNER BAR -- NIGHT 111
Shortly after Xavier is with them in the booth

XAVIER
It was so brutal how it ended
between us I know I was too angry
and a bit crazy but I thought what
we had was stronger than that That
you would not just walk away after
one disagreement With all we had
been through couldn’t you have
just forgiven me

Lily says nothing for a few moments

LILY
It wasn’t just that

XAVIER
Oh you mean my Cathar beliefs

Lily nods Xavier is a little emotional

XAVIER (CONT’D)
Well I am no longer a Cathar

LILY
How’s that possible

XAVIER
It’s been very difficult

FRED
Youve entirely dropped your
adherence to the Cathar faith

XAVIER
Yes I have
FRED
Good Normally I’d be reluctant to
comment on anyone’s religion

XAVIER
What

FRED
I’m sorry I guess I’m a bit of a
bigot -- I could never take

seriously a religion that worships
on Tuesdays All the major
religions require worship on the
weekend -- Friday Saturday or
Sunday I find it really laudatory
that people should sacrifice their
weekend time to Worship God

He checks his watch
XAVIER

Having sabbath on Tuesday always
seemed very bizarre to me It is

not right
FRED
Wed better get to the Lone Star--
LILY
Why are you so concerned about
that
FRED

It’s not as if international dance
crazes start every day

EXT TOWN STREET -- NIGH
Fred Lily and Xavier hurry down the sidewalk -- semi-
Jogging

FRED

We better hurry
They pick up the pace Lily seems a little less keen on
getting to their destination --
EXT LONE STAR -- NIGHT

The three approach the Lone Star just as Rose Heather
Violet and Jimbo come out looking downcast

FRED
What’s wrong
VIOLET
Another fiasco

114 INT GIRLS ROOM -- NIGHT 114
All four are in bed in the dark

VIOLET
Sometimes our struggle reminds me
of the Myth of Sisyphus

HEATHER
Who

VIOLET
The myth about the guy who pushes
an enormous rock up a hill only to
have it keep rolling back down
again

HEATHER
Oh yeah What a knucklehead The
important thing to remember is that
he was mythical -- he never really
existed

LILY
Violet did you spend any part of
your education at a school called
Willamette Montessori

VIOLET
In Oregon Why
115 INT COFFEE COTTAGE -- DAY 115

Thor Jimbo and the girls huddled inside on a drab day they
glance at Fred who speaks on his phone on the Coffee

Cottage’s porch -- a drizzle falls outside
THOR
Would you say that today is “very
gray”

Jimbo looks around

JIMBO
Id say so Maybe “blue-gray”

Thor looks around trying to factor this in Fred finishes
the call and comes in

FRED
I’m sorry her name wasn’t “Emily
Tweeter” but “Lucy Wurlitzer” I

know they’re not very similar I’m
beginning to realize that the human
memory is not the foolproof
instrument we sometimes imagine
What’s worse it seems everyone knew
all about my obsession including
my parents and siblings --
precisely those from whom I most
wanted it kept

ROSE
So from your earliest years you
were already a playboy or oper-a-
tor type

FRED
Yes I suppose that’s why secrecy
seemed so desirable

LILY
Violet can I talk to you

Lily having silently followed all this stands and nods to
Violet who gets up too As they walk to the coffee counter
Lily whispers to her confidentially

LILY (CONT’D)
What’s the plural of doufus

VIOLET
Doufi

LILY
Not doufuses

VIOLET
You can say either “doufi”
respects the Latin root and so is
preferred “Doufuses” is also
correct although a bit inelegant

LILY
You’ve thought a lot about this
VIOLET
Yes I’ve had to
LILY
Hmmm
VIOLET
What What is it
LILY
I like Fred -- he’s a nice guy and
I can see why you like him Any

mass of people such as you might
find in a large university or high
school divides into many different
groups Normally there’s a “cool
crowd” and then variously less
cool crowds When I first met you
and Rose I thought you were the
“cool crowd” -- and in many ways
you are I find your perfume and
fashion sense excellent

VIOLET
Thank you

LILY
Butthere’s a reason I think
why you are so strongly attracted
to doufi And it’s not an
accident How different groups
divide up

While Lily speaks Violet notices something
HEATHER (0S)

Thor No
EXT COFFEE COTTAGE -- DAY 116
They turn in time to see Thor run into the street followed by
Heather The sun is out and its rays bouncing off the dark
clouds still hanging in the sky create an exquisite lighting
effect Everyone follows them into the street In the
distance a rainbow has formed -- this is what panicked
Heather Thor runs hell for leather toward the beautiful
arc Heather after him

HEATHER
Thor No Stop Please stop

TIGHT ON Thor’s face as he runs torn with emotion
VIOLET
He’s headed for Robertson Hall
EXT ROBERTSON HALL -- DAY 117

Thor disappears inside

INT ROBERTSON HALL -- DAY 118

Thor runs up the stairs Heather behind

EXT ROBERTSON ROOF -- DAY 119

Thor runs toward the balustrade Heather comes up from the
stairs almost too winded to call
119A

At the balustrade Thor stops for a moment and gazes at the
rainbow in its terrifying splendor He points first to the
topmost band of color then each succeeding one

THOR
Red Orange Yellow Green
Blue Indigo Violet
Hallelujah Lord God thank you

Heather reaches him and they embrace gazing at the rainbow
together Thor’s face wet with tears of joy

THOR (CONTD)
Education We can learn the
subjects we set out to master no
matter how hard or impossible they
may seem Thank you Thank you --
I wasn’t sure I was going to make
it

Together they look to the rainbow horizon Thor studies and
nods his head again toward it proud of his new competence

THOR (CONTD)
Magenta Pink Mauve

EXT SEVEN OAKS -- DAY 119A
Rose and Violet thoughtful study together on benches

VIOLET
I miss my nice American friend

ROSE
No you’re mistaken

VIOLET
Oh come on you go to London for
four weeks--

ROSE
Six

VIOLET
It’s very dangerous parents
letting their children travel
They see them off at the airport
and don’t know what they’1l be
getting back

Rose reflects on this
ROSE

I don’t know what you’re referring
to

VIOLET
You’re not from London

ROSE
I’m from London I was there and
now I’m here I’m “from” London

VIOLET
I just miss my nice American
friend

ROSE
Nice
(caricatures a nasal
American accent)
“Nice Nice Fine ‘Fine’”
(reverts to type
Those are not adjectives I like to

use God gave us abilities -- he
requires that we use them “Good
Better Best” “Excelsior
Higher” Only excellence can

glorify the Lord Vulgarity is in
essence blasphemous

TITLE CARD
In the Matter of the Doufi

EXT QUADRANGLE -- DAY

Lily and Violet come down a path both in frilly “Damsels”

costumes

LILY
I’m sorry what I was saying before -
- of course you’re not
irretrievably linked to the doufi
or even that such distinctions are
valid--

VIOLET
No don’t apologize -- I probably
do have a “doufi” orientation But
behind “coolness” isn’t there a
certain repressing squashing down
or at lack of cultivation of one’s
humanity

LILY
Oh so you think cool people have
less humanity

VIOLET
No of course not I don’t think
cool people are entirely inhuman --
just enough to be cool
LILY
In our society there’s all this
propaganda in favor of uniqueness
eccentricity etc but does the
world really want or need more of
such traits Aren’t such people
usually terrible pains in the neck
What the world needs to work
properly is a large mass of normal

people -- I’d like to be one of
those -- sorry
VIOLET

But you will still do the part

LILY
Yeah Of course

TITLE CARD
Dress Rehearsal

INT SUICIDE CENTER -- DAY 121

In the long dance mirror first Lily then Violet appear in
their extravagant costumes for the musical

LILY
Omigod we look ridiculous

Violet looks at their reflection serene

VIOLET
Yes I think that’s good

They disappear from frame Cut to Freak cueing the music on
the Suicide Center stereo system The first notes of the
“Damsels” overture begin

VIOLET (CONTD)
So do you know every number from
every Fred Astaire movie

FRED
No there were two in our school
musical I know those

VIOLET
But did performing those two
numbers help you overcome
adolescent feelings of
discouragement and despair

FRED
Absolutely

VIOLET
(calls)
Freak

Freak responds to her signal pressing “play” on the stereo
boombox The song starts -- Fred begins the quiet lyric

FRED
If I should suddenly start to sing
Or stand on my head or anything
Dont think that Ive lost my
senses
Its just that my happiness finally
commences

Fred takes Violet’s hand and leads her out of the building

FRED (CONTD)
The long long ages of dull despair
Are turning into thin air
And it seems that suddenly Ive
Become the happiest guy alive--

EXT QUADRANGLE -- DAY 122

Fred and Violet emerge from the drab building into the more
glorious world of a Seven Oaks version movie musical --
Violet joins him in song

VIOLET and FRED
Things are looking up
Ive been looking the landscape
over
And its covered with 4 leaf clover
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

Bitter was my cu

But no more will I be the mourner
For Ive certainly turned the
corner

Oh things are looking up Since love
looked up at me

Others from the cast move in behind them with some pairing
off -- Lily with Xavier Thor with Heather Frank and Freak
with Rose Jimbo with Priss

ENSEMBLE
See the sunbeams
Every one beams
Just because of you
Loves in session
And my depression
Is unmistakably through

They pass Doar Dorm now a paradise of decorous Dior-ness

DOAR DORM CHORUS
Things are looking up
Its a great little world we live
in
Oh were happy as pups
Since love looked up at us

The song continues then as the music fades an “iris” fade
out of the image -- then partially re-opens

CLOSE UP of a smiling Violet -- lighting location and
costume are dark and atmospheric The music to a future hit
dance song starts

VIOLET
(a big smile)
Hey everybody Let’s--

INT THE LONE STARDANCE LOCALE -- NIGHT 123

The music goes full blast the iris opens fully Violet is in
a dance locale perhaps the Lone Star with better lighting

VIOLET
do the -- “Sam-bo-la”

To the dance hit’s irresistible beat Violet does the
“Sambola” -- soon joined by the others except Rose -- the
camera moves among the dancers a la “American Bandstand”
Rose sits watching critically Jimbo goes to her

JIMBO
You’re not dancing

Rose shakes her head

ROSE
Looks to me like just another
Devil Dance I’m waiting for a

dance of truth and beauty and
righteousness A dance that
glorifies not the body but the
Lord

JIMBO
Wow You might have a long wait

Credits roll Subsequently Freak’s partner tires -- he
invites Rose to dance she drops her resistance and joins in
with great skill
