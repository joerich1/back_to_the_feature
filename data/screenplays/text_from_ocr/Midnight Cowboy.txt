on his immediate fellow travelers -- an OLD LADY in front of

stretches himself across both seats and turns on his radio
finds only static and snaps it off Further depressed he
examines his reflection in the bus window squeezes a black
head and runs the comb through his hair picks a piece of
tobacco off his tooth and lights a cigarette watching the
flame die in reflection forgetting to discard the burnt-out
match as he stares out at a vast lonely prairie a solitary

relieved as she takes out a gold lame purse and
it upside down

empty

Joe tries to laugh but it sticks in his throat as Cass speaks
-- an impassioned whisper -- still holding Joes chin

she throws herself on the bed Joe stands
bewildered by the vastness of her grief
JOE
Hey Hey Cass Did you think I
meant that Christ would I be
asking you for money with a wad
like that riding on my hip

Joe waves his wallet at her but she only cries louder He
hands her a kleenex She clutches it to her face wailing
Joe leans over the bed whispering in her ear

JOE (CONTD)
Hey You are a gorgeous-looking
piece Cass Guy gets horny just
looking at you Its a fact How
much you need for that taxi Ten
Twenty There you go

Joe tucks a twenty-dollar bill into her bosom tilts his

Stetson and starts out Cass blows her nose looking after
him OS chorus sings From this valley they say you are
going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile

EXT LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY

From a high angle Joe walks away from the apartment house
chorus continuing OS they say you are taking the
sunshine that brightened our pathway a while

INT EVERETTS BAR - DAY

Joe sits at the bar staring morosely at his image in the
mirror already quite drunk oblivious to the assorted types
hiding from daylight in the barn-like saloon waiting for
night to fall

RATSOS VOICE
Excuse me Im just admiring that
colossal shirt

RATSO studies Joe across the corner of the bar -- a sickly
child-size old man of twenty-one -- hopefully nursing an
empty beer glass contemplating the money on the bar in front
of Joe

RATSO
That is one hell of a shirt I bet
you paid a pretty price for it am
I right
JOE
Oh it aint cheap I mean yeah
Id say this was an all right
shirt Dont like to uh you know

back

Ratso spits as JACKIE leans on the bar next to Joe -- a
feminine young person heavily made-up hair teased wearing
earrings and a lace-trimmed blouse over shocking pink levis

JACKIE
Got a cigarette cowboy

RATSO
(a stage whisper)
More goddam faggots in this town

Reaching for a cigarette Joe glances at Jackie startled as
Jackie twitches his pink levis angrily and turns away

JOE

Shee-it

(shakes his head)
Kee-rist you really know the
ropes Wish to hell I bumped into
you before Im Joe Buck from Texas

RATSO
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx Dont

JOE
(slaps bar)
Same all around For my friend

The TV screen over the bar features a mating game program as
Jackie cruises down to join a tall farm boy with plucked
eyebrows The TV HOST points to three young men visible only
from the shoulders up from whom a pretty DATE GIRL in
blindfold must choose an escort

TV HOST
and for the losers who dont
get the girl well give as
consolation prices -- a six month
supply of underarm deodorant

In a booth now -- the TV screen in the background continuing
the game -- Joe is refilling Ratsos beer glass as he speaks
loud over the laughter of the TV audience

JOE

with color TV and more goddam
diamonds than an archbishop and she

JACKIE

(to Ratso)

Good night sweets

TV HOST

The TV host pulls aside the screen which has concealed the
lower half of the three young men Number Two her chosen
mate is a dwarf sitting on a high stool The girls
spontaneous dismay starts everyone laughing hysterically
including the dwarf
EXT SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

Joe has difficulty keening up with Ratso who swings himself
along with surprising agility his half skipping little gate
favoring one game leg

RATSO
Look with these chicks that want

to Times Square to pick out the
merchandise They need a middleman

Joe hesitates as Ratso darts into traffic against a red
light yelling unheard obscenities at a cab driver who blasts
his horn Joe runs recklessly forward as Ratso slams the taxi
fender with his fist pretending to be hit falling into
Joes arms The taxi stops halting traffic Ratso recovers
strolls casually in front of the cab biting his thumb at the
driver

RATSO (CONTD)
It is a crime a stud like you
passing out double sawbucks to a
chick like that With proper
management you should be taking
home fifty a hundred bucks a day
More if you wanta moonlight

EXT SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR

Atthe corner of Central Park South Ratso points toward a
young man with diamond cuff-links sitting with a blue-haired
matron who puffs on a small cigar Ratso waves jauntily at
the young man raising his thumb and forefinger in a circle
leaving the young man baffled as Ratso hurries Joe on

RATSO
Him I placed with ODaniel just two
weeks ago And look Not much of a
stud either what I hear

EXT CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - COCKTAIL HOUR

Ratso automatically checks the coin return boxes of the phone

leaving Joe alone repeating Cherry Neverlin as he starts
along the corridor looking for 901

Joe finds 901 at a dark end of the corridor knocks
confidently hearing a few bars of his love theme as he
stuffs a fresh stick of gum in his mouth Then the door is
thrown open by ODANIEL -- for an instant appearing to wear a
diamond-studded skull-cap the naked overhead light bulb
bright after the dark corridor halating in Joes eyes like
the earlier dollar sign

ODANIEL

electric cord He shoves it into a wall socket switches off
the overhead light and suddenly a hollow tinted plastic
Jesus glows on the dresser OS a revivalist congregation
sings And now we notice with Joe placards and flags horns

across the table up his mothers arm and around her face
With a polite nod Joe opens the crackers and squirts one
with ketchup Joe upsets his chair as a great gob of ketchup
spills onto his pants

but threatening clashing warning as

from a high angle across the street Joe joins the other
midnight cowboys offering himself to all comers His figure
is momentarily obliterated by traffic then

spasmodically choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the
butt and drops it in his coffee cup

Coughing eyes tearing Ratso empties his pockets on the

two pawn tickets He raises his eyes somehow ashamed Joe
kicks the toe of Ratsos loafer

Ratso fills a saucepan from the tub-sink sets it on a Sterno
stove Joe sits himself on the mattress-bed pretending to
test it weeks of exhaustion and tension overwhelming him
suddenly his only immediate problem being the effort to
restrain a large comfortable yawn

JOE

Joe stretches himself yawning his eyelids drooping heavily
The sounds of the city recede Joes love theme plays softly
on a distant radio Joes eyes close momentarily in spite of
him elf

EXT VEGETABLE MARKET - DAY

Ratso wears a threadbare raincoat of faded black several
sizes too large as he shops with housewives at a sidewalk
vegetable stand -- elbowing his way through the ladies
testing fruit picking up vegetables and putting them back --
till the GREENGROCER spots him

GREENGROCER
You Out Out I told you I calla
cops

The other shoppers deliberately turn their backs avoiding
involvement As the Greengrocer grabs Ratso Joe ambles into
the scene wearing his dangerous little smile

JOE
Hey looka here that aint nice
picking on a cripple

Joe intervenes just long enough for Ratso to escape then
ambles on leaving the Greengrocer in frustrated fury Camera
holds on a tray of coconuts

INT X FLAT - DAY

Joe lies on his cot watching Ratso struggle to penetrate the
fibrous husk of a coconut experimenting with a variety of
rusty tools in an old cigar box

RATSO
The two basic items necessary to
sustain life are sunshine and
coconut milk Thats a known fact
If I can find the goddam hole the
milk squirts out
JOE
This is an okay setup you got here
but Id say you aint just exactly

RATSO

Joe takes his time rising to hold the coconut while Ratso
tries to poke a hole with a bent ice-pick

RATSO (CONTD)
In Florida they come smooth ready
to eat
Down there your only problem is
diet-wise you gotta lift an arm to
wipe warm milk off your chin
Tough hey

JOE
I think finding yous the smartest
thing I ever did for both of us
You just the crooked kinda sneaky
little sidewinder I need to get me
hustling in this town Hey

Joe jerks his hand away just in time to avoid the ice-pick
The coconut bounces on the floor Ratso picks it up holds
it while Joe tries to crack it swinging his boot like a
hammer

RATSO
Miami Beach is the only place for a
real hustler Florida has more rich
chicks per square yard than any
resort spot in the world They lie
out in their pagodas and pergolas
waiting to grab the first jockstrap
that passes

stable down there now

leg sucking his thumb
RATSO

raises the X window

wrapped in a blanket -- angle widening to show Ratso

spotting Joes jacket slacks and shirt with cleaning fluid --
his eyes on a very pregnant Italian lady As she starts to
load a coin cleaning machine Ratso intervenes solicitously
speaking in Italian

RATSO

turns to seat herself beside Joe

rear of the shop Joe sets it on his head and examines
himself in a mirror as the owner hands Ratso the bill

RATSO (CONTD)
Wheres mine The black homburg I
brought it in the same time

The owner glances at the slip puzzled returns to the rear
of the shop to search for the nonexistent homburg Ratso
quickly drags Joe away from the mirror and out of the shop

INT SUBWAY ARCADE - NIGHT

The rhythmic duet of boots and loafers follows Joe and Ratso
- checking coin boxes and telephone booths -- till they reach
a shoeshine stand locked for the night They loiter till a
young couple has disappeared then Joe kicks loose the
padlock on the equipment drawer mounts one of the chairs and
Ratso goes to work on his boots with furious expertise
flourishing double brushes snapping the rag like a jazz
drummer

JOE
Hey youre good I bet you could
pick up a living at this if you
tried

RATSO
And end up a hunchback like my old
man You think Im crippled You
shoulda caught him the end of a
day

Ratso demonstrates a chimpanzee walk Joe laughs Ratso turns
back in panic as another man takes a chair next to Joe Ratso
is about to retuse when a cop takes the third chair swinging
his handcuffs around to the front tapping his shoe with his
night stick Ratso quickly drops a rag over the broken
padlock cursing under his breath as he starts working on all
three customers at the same time

RATSOS VOICE
You think its funny

INT X FLAT - DAY

Joe is seated in a straight-back chair near the X window a
towel tucked around his neck as Ratso trims his hair almost
as expert a barber as shoeshine boy

RATSO
Stupid bastard coughed his lungs
out breathing that resin all day
They buried him with gloves on
Even the fag undertaker couldnt
get his nails clean

As if by conditioned reflex Ratso chokes on the cigarette in
his mouth coughing painfully He crushes it out opens the
window to spit shivering then slam it and turns back to
remove the towel from Joes neck

JOE
Kee-rist you pretty damn clever
for a skimpy little gimp

RATSO
You like it Take a look

JOE
Dont rush me How I do it see I
get myself primed like I was
turning on the charm for some
pretty little blonde lady then
kinda mosey away slow and easy and
- swing around -- and there you
are you handsome devil
Joe performs his ritual as he speaks but more relaxed
faintly laughing at himself with Ratso The wall mirror has
been added since we last saw the flat along with a legless
overstuffed chair with burnt-out cushions a tasselled table
cover pinups calendar girls and several new Florida tourist
posters Ratso moves to Joes side arranging the
neckerchief nodding

RATSO
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- youre
okay youre okay

JOE
What Im gonna do Im gonna make a
cowboy outta you kid How about

Joe slaps his hat on Ratsos head tilts it hooks Ratsos
thumbs in his jeans and shoves a cigarette into the corner of
Ratsos mouth Ratso laughs till he chokes -- for one
instant self-consciously mimicking Joe -- then removes the
hat and reaches for his threadbare black raincoat

JOE (CONTD)
Okay you got yourself one
handsome sweet-smelling cowboy
strut your stuff

EXT CONVERTED TOWN HOUSE - DAY

Joe and Ratso peer down through a basement bay window into
the office of THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN ESCORT SERVICE --

discreet companionship and personal guided tours in any

a memo and hands it to an immaculate young ESCORT who slips
the memo into his topcoat pocket as he comes from the office
and hails a cab Ratso darts forward limping exaggeratedly
holding the door lifting the memo as he brushes off the
Escorts topcoat The young man waves him away with out a
tip Ratso slams the door and bites his thumb after the cab

A weary Santa Claus in a rented beard and over-large

In the background as Ratso speaks HANSEL and GRETEL
MACALBERTSON enter the lunch counter inspecting the

dressed as twins both blond and pretty

MacAlbertsons in the mirror standing behind him studying
him Gretel nods Hansel hands Joe a large black card
smiling vaguely then moves on

RATSO (CONTD)
What was that all about

Joe studies the black card frowning at first suddenly
smiling turning as if to call after the MacAlbertsons but
they are disappearing around the corner Joe hands the card
to Ratso

shakes his head wonderingly turning to study himself in the
mirror

EXT LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

Snow swirls in the aureole of a street light as Joe and Ratso
run heads lowered turning into

INT LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

a drab entrance hall dimly lit -- signs identifying
various commercial tenants -- a pink-on-black placard reading
MACALBERTSON TWO FLIGHTS UP Joe has started up before he
notices Ratso leaning on the bannister at the foot of the
stairs struggling to catch his breath His face and hair are
wet with perspiration his lips lavender-blue

In swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in
Ratsos eyes so intense that Joe shares it unable to speak
or offer reassurance

JOE
Better dry your hair some You
sweating all over the goddam place

Joe pulls out his shirttail grabs Ratso by the neck and rubs
his head dry

JOE (CONTD)
You got a comb

RATSO
Dont need a comb

JOE
Few dozen cooties wont kill me
dont guess

Joe hands Ratso his own comb Ratso swipes at his tangled
hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb He hands the
comb back tugs at his hair with his fingers pats it in
place then looks back into Joes eyes

RATSO
Okay I look okay
In a moment of silence distant sounds can be heard -- a
siren the grinding teeth of a garbage truck the twang of an
electric guitar upstairs at the party -- then Ratso makes a
quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs pulling
himself on the bannister

INT MACALBERTSONS LOFT - NIGHT

A bank of lights blinds Joe and Ratso as they enter --
electronic rock blasts their ears -- a bearded cameraman on a
step-ladder photographs them as they stand confused -- facing
a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up showing the
murder of a hippie known as Groovy -- in-huge black letters
LOVE WAS GROOVY -- GROOVY IS DEAD Joe shouts over the
amplified music

JOE
Better get a hold of someone and
tell them Im here

Ratso points to his ear -- he cant hear -- following Joe
across the room The huge loft is crowded with a random
selection gathered to serve as dress extras in an
underground film The party is the scene The MacAlbertsons
merely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen with
cameras strategically placed to record the happening

Hansel with tape recorder Gretel with hand-held camera
drifting through the crowd -- catching words and images in a
detached whimsical fashion Gretel turns her camera on Joe
and Ratso as they approach

JOE (CONTD)
Well I made it This here is Ratso
Rizzo and I

RATSO
Rico Rico Rizzo

Gretel smiles without recognition Hansel gestures vaguely

HANSEL
Do you need anything I mean
theres beer and so forth Whatever
your thing is

The twins move away together pausing to confer with the
operator of a tripod camera -- focused on an emaciated flower
girl with long hair and dirty feet stretched ina
sarcophagus clutching a dead daffodil her eyes glazed
Scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head -- LOVE

RATSO
If you want the word on that
brother and sister act Ill give
you the word That Hansels a fag
and Gretels got the hots for
herself So who cares right Load
up on the salami

Ratso heads for the refreshment table Joe starts after him
but pauses intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a
light show is in progress -- surreal images of naked bodies
projected against abstract currents of color and strobe
light

a bored fat lady in a muu-muu squatted like a Buddha at
a low table rolling joints for the guests
She lights a joint and offers it to Joe as he wanders in to
watch the show Joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what
it is

JOE
Shee-it this is one helluva party

glancing around at the others imitating their techniques
-- the quick inhaler who follows with sharp gulps of air -
the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale -- the stylist
who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils
-- Joe puffing himself slightly dizzy starting to laugh at
the silent flick effect of the strobe light -- the action
around him slowing almost imperceptibly overcranked -- a
veil of smoke hanging over the fat womans face transforming
her into a laughing witch -- a similar veil around Joes
head relaxing the self-conscious tension of his face
spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand
grinning at

a serious young technician handling the light show
scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh

Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back
to the crowded loft fascinated to see

a crew with cameras and lights on the balcony at one end
of the loft photographing the scene below

a dark-haired lady by the name of SHIRLEY -- chic in the
style of a gangsters moll -- drinking beer from the bottle
predatory eyes searching the crowd

Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the
buffet table glancing nervously over his shoulder unaware
of Gretel and her hand-held camera photographing Ratso as he
steals turning away casually disinterested

Joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black
girl -- the lights swinging around them -- faces swimming

Shirley in fleeting close-up gone in an instant
reappearing

INT MACALBERTSON BATHROOM - NIGHT

her face in the mirror smiling in a dark provocative way
-- Joe standing at the bathroom door forgetting to be
embarrassed as Shirley turns away from the mirror
unhurriedly running her fingers through her hair boldly
meeting Joes eyes

SHIRLEY

JOE
Yeah oh yeah

SHIRLEY
Whatll we do Leave now or what
Your place or mine Oh God the
second I looked at you I knew Did

Joe grins watching Shirleys lips move unable to keep her
in sync startled to hear Ratsos voice

RATSOS VOICE
Shes hooked

INT MACALBERTSONS LOFT - NIGHT

Joe realizes he is back at the party Ratso whispering
hoarsely

RATSO
Id say she was good for ten
bucks but Ill ask for twenty
But Joe is watching with terrible fascination as Hansel and
Gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus

SHIRLEYS VOICE
Did you know We were going to make
it

Joe glances down to see himself flanked by Ratso and Shirley

RATSO
You really want to do business

SHIRLEY
Whos he Oh God Dont tell me you
two are a couple --

The flower girl hypnotically dazed accepts a broom dipped
in black paint and smears a huge X across LOVE Joe laughs

HANSELS VOICE
Why are you laughing Joe

Hansel holds a microphone toward Joe who shrugs grinning at
Ratso and Shirley Gretels camera moves down Joes body

HANSEL
Are you for real Joe

JOE
Well I aint a freal cowboy but
Im one hell of a stud

Shirley glances at Ratso who nods whispering in her ear

RATSO
A very expensive stud And I happen
to be his manager

The scene -- from Joes viewpoint -- becomes increasingly
confusing and fragmented dialogue and image moving in and
out of focus cameras and lights surrounding him keeping the
center of attention in his own blown mind

Shirleys eyes unnaturally bright inspecting his body
lingering on his thighs moistening her lips

SHIRLEY
Its too much -- to come face to
face with a walking talking sex
fantasy -- to buy a mans -- God

the tall black girl dancing in stroble light starting to
remove her clothes -- Gretel following her with a camera

SHIRLEYS VOICE
I cant wait to tell my man Monday
I should be taking notes Look at
my arm

Shirleys talon-like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh
on her tanned arm

RATSOS VOICE
I gotta sit down I feel crummy

Ratso stretched out on a Victorian love seat -- the flower
girl walking unsteadily passing out dead daffodils placing
one in Ratsos hand Gretel photographing his reaction

SHIRLEYS VOICE
Eat it -- a man in your line of
work has to keep his strength up

Shirley bringing Joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate
watching him bite into it

SHIRLEY
Its fantastic now I know
everything you do has sexual
implications
If I you know bought it -- could I
take pictures of you naked Thats
part of it isnt it kinky kinda
things

the tall black girl and a few others are trying to
promote an orgy A scrofulous old wino dances spastically
working his toothless gums preparing to expose himself to
two girls dancing together

HANSELS VOICE
We want you Joe Youve been

chosen
five youths stand beside the sarcophagus -- two sailors
two cycle freaks a weight-lifter -- waiting to be

pallbearers Joe joins them All lights and cameras are
turned on the slow funeral procession carrying the flower
girl out of the loft to the tune of Moonlight and Roses
Strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene

SHIRLEYS VOICE
I had a thing for him Before I
knew Why should knowing make it
more of a thing

Shirley talks to Gretel as she photographs the funeral

SHIRLEY
Naturally Ill have to ask myself
why a cowboy And why a cowboy
whore But not tonight

INT MACALBERTSON LANDING - NIGHT
Shirley is pulling her coat out of the pile on the bannister

SHIRLEY
Incidentally how much is this
going to cost me anyway

Joe turns to Ratso whose attention is fixed on the coats

JOE
Tell her Ratso

RATSO
Twenty bucks

SHIRLEY
Sold Lets go

RATSO
and taxi fare for me

SHIRLEY
Get lost

RATSO
I agree And for that service I

She takes a dollar from her purse and hands it to Ratso
takes Joes arm and starts down the stairs Ratso lingers
starting quickly through the coats frisking them for loose
change
INT LOFT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT
At the foot of the stairs Shirley kisses Joe violently

SHIRLEY
Your names Joe Which is fabulous
Joe could be anyone Kiss me Joe
move over Joe go away Joe Its
just perfect

They glance up as Ratso appears Swinging down too rapidly on
the bannister He misses a step and falls -- a clowns fall
unable to stop but apparently not hurting himself Shirley
and Joe are laughing when Ratso lands at the foot of the
stairs

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
He fell Hey fella you fell Is
he all right

RATSO
(rises mimics)
Is he all right

JOE
Well if youre awright why you

fanning herself Joe rolls down the window

EXT VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT
Joe leans out of the taxi window waving his Stetson
bellowing at the snow

JOE
Whoopee ti yi yo

EXT LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

Ratso makes his way slowly from the building to the curb
whistling between his teeth sharply hailing a cab The cab
slows to a stop Then the driver sees Ratso shifts into gear
and drives on Ratso bites his thumb after the cab rests for
a moment on the lamp post then starts painfully inching his
way along the deserted street

INT SHIRLEYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joe lies on his back staring fixedly at a fragile mobile
hanging from the ceiling stirring listlessly

SHIRLEYS VOICE
That happens Dont worry about
it

Shirley leans on one elbow looking at Joe sympathetically
fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh Still
avoiding Shirleys eyes Joe finds a cigarette on the side
table searches for matches

JOE
Well thats something never
happened to me before you can bet
your bottom dollar Uh wheres the
matches maam

SHIRLEY
Top drawer Maybe if you didnt
call me maam things would work
out better

Joe finds the matches lights up and lies back staring at
the mobile as he smokes still not looking at Shirley

JOE
First goddam time it ever quit on
me Fact

The repressed laugh finally breaks through Shirley stifles
it quickly as Joe sits up looking at her
JOE (CONTD)
You think Im lying

SHIRLEY
(controls herself)
No Of course not Just something
struck me funny

Close on Joe -- watching Shirley closely reacting

SHIRLEYS VOICE

I just put myself in your shoes I
had this image of a bugler without
a horn a policeman without a
stick etcetera etcetera and I

(giggles)
I think Id better shut up Im
making it worse

Shirley composes her face reaching out to touch Joe But
that doesnt help either He reacts sharply

SHIRLEY
Maybe we should take a little nap
see what happens

JOE
I aint sleepy

SHIRLEY
I know Scribbage

Extreme close-up of Joe -- frowning puzzled

JOE
Shee-it

camera pulling back to show Joe concentrating on a game
spread out on the sheet consisting of nine dice lettered on
all sides the object being to build as many words as
possible Scrabble fashion while a sand timer counts the
seconds Shirley watches Joes efforts to think with
sympathetic amusement The only word Joe has composed so far
is MAN

SHIRLEY
Thats pretty Freudian Joe
JOE

What Its a perfectly good word
aint it How much time I got

(glances up)
Goddam sand thing drive you crazy
Kee-rist Spelling never was a very
strong point with me Even in
school

SHIRLEY
If you didnt talk so much maybe
you could think more

JOE
Talking helps Dont talk you get
muddled in your head Hey Now you
just look at this here

Joe spells out MONY down from the M in MAN

SHIRLEY
Theres an E in MONEY If thats
your word

JOE
M-O-N-Y -- Im right Thats just
exactly how they spell it up there
on that big building bet you could
see it from here M-O-N-Y

SHIRLEY
(stifles giggle)
Okay Never argue with a man

JOE
Y -- what in hell starts with Y

Shirley slyly trails the tips of her fingernails across Joes
chest as she leans over to study the game breathing softly
into his ear as she speaks

SHIRLEY
It can end in Y day pay lay --
hey pay lay

One predatory hand rests on his knee -- as if by accident -
disarranging the sheet talon nails lightly brushing his
thigh
JOE
Cut it out Thats cheating
teasing me so I cant think
Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna
beat you

SHIRLEY
You gonna beat me Joe

JOE
Beat your butt you dont lemme
think

SHIRLEY
Gay ends in Y Fey You like that --
gay fey -- is that your problem

JOE

I show you what problem --

But the end of his sentence is swallowed by Shirley taking
his kiss in her open mouth crushed by its impact an animal
noise snarling deep in her throat -- the agonized alley cat
wail of pleasure -- Joes problem is solved Joes love theme
swells triumphant At the same time Shirley half-rises
trying to force Joes head down her own on top The issue is
joined Shirley has named the game Her objective is to force
Joe onto his back Joes objective is to retain his
initiative Camera ignores the classic action on the central
front concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical
maneuvers

Joes elbows pinning her shoulders

her eyes bright accepting the challenge

his tight smile revealing clenched teeth

her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm

Joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly

Shirley laughing triumphantly

his hand closing on her wrist

her talon-nails clawing the air

her toes walking up his calf
her legs suddenly locking around his knees

her free hand grabbing his hair

her shoulder rising as she forces his head back
her lips pressing down on his

his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh

her eyes popping teeth clamping his ear lobe
his hand catching her ankle

her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams
her foot appearing upside down beside her face
her talon-nails furrowing flesh drawing blood
his head rearing back roaring

both rolling to the floor out of view

her feet suddenly flying up into view

her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket
her other hand wildly exploring Joes back

her ankles locking spasmodically

her eyes and mouth wide gaping

the blanket suddenly ripping free flying into the air as
her arm flings itself around Joe

the bedclothes spilling down around them muffling her
ascending shrieks

JOES VOICE
Whoopee ti yi yo

INT SHIRLEYS BEDROOM —- MORNING
Shirley has difficulty reverting to her nine-to-five role as

a Madison Avenue career girl Half-dressed for work she is
talking on the telephone her eyes on the open door to the
bathroom through which Joes voice continues singing

the money in Joes hand

INT MENS STORE - DAY

INT X FLAT - DAY

Ratso huddled in the overstuffed chair -- wearing the
stolen sheepskin coat -- wrapped in blankets his teeth
chattering in spite of the sweat on his forehead Joe stops
abruptly his mood shattered by Ratsos alarming condition
They simply stare at each other for a moment then Joe turns
away to see soup heating on the Sterno stove Joe tosses one
of his paper bags onto Ratsos lap

JOE
See what you think of that crap
Ill pour your soup Got some of
that junk you like to swill too
Mentholatum Aspirin All that shee

Ratso opens the paper bag trying to control his shivering
pulling out the socks and a suit of long underwear He sees
Joe watching him for a reaction The best Ratso can do is a
slight shake of his head

JOE (CONTD)
They wrong

RATSO
No But while you was buying the
underwear I could have lifted the
socks

JOE
You couldnt lift fly specks from a
sugar bowl Can you hold this

Joe hands Ratso the soup Ratso seems steadied by the warmth
in his hands He nods sipping the soup

RATSO

answered by a womans voice

between both of his own like an old friend

Townys face appears huge at Joes shoulder

TOWNY
This is my first night in town and
Ill consider it a ghastly omen
clouding my entire ten days if you

Townys mouth continues speaking at an incredible rate but
his words are drowned out momentarily by the grinder of a
sanitation truck chewing up a discarded Christmas tree with
tinsel clinging to it Towny is still talking when theyve
passed the truck

TOWNY (CONTD)

The room has little to recommend it except its size and large
French window through which -- ignored by Joe -- the Mutual
tower flashes MONY Towny waves Joe toward the couch quickly
slipping several physical culture magazines from the coffee
table onto a shelf beneath

TOWNY

The coffee table is littered with empty cartons of Chinese

food soaked through with brown sauce Joe finds the last egg

TOWNY
Sometimes it seems to me time

this war there was this handsome
young man with quite black hair and
he was supposed to die But he
didnt Isnt that amusing

JOE
What

Townys dialogue moves out of sync Townys eyes seem to look
into camera -- from Joes viewpoint -- but slightly past it
The quality of the scene grows increasingly disjointed as Joe
glances around the room looking for something to steal
losing personal contact with Towny viewing him as an object
to be used for a specific purpose

TOWNY
Enough about me Im through
talking for the evening Now I want
to hear about conditions in the
West The romance of the West holds
a tremendous power over me Mother

INT TOWNYS BATHROOM - NIGHT

searches with increasing desperation for something of value
An old electric razor is too bulky for Joes pocket probably
worthless anyhow Townys array of medicines merely recalls
Joes purpose

Christopher medal from his sack and hands it to Joe His eyes
are looking past Joe his speech out of sync

Oh Yes Of course I should have
thought You shouldnt have to ask
That was thoughtless of me Yes
Wait here

Towny hurries across the room to the bedside table Beside
the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman
wearing a hearing-aid
Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet
from the drawer lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back
and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost
knocking the lamp off the table in his fright Pressed
against the table protecting but calling attention to his
wallet Towny holds out the bill

TOWNY (CONTD)
Here Dont even thank me

JOE
(takes the bill)
I gotta have moren ten I gotta
have fifty-seven dollars

TOWNY
I simply dont have it Joe

JOE
Get outta my way

TOWNY
Youre wasting your time Theres
nothing in there

Towny clutches the table staring at Joe shaking his head
like a bad little boy Joe backhands him angrily Trying to
duck the blow Towny stumbles and slips to the floor but
grabs the table in his arms watching Joe out of the corner
of his eyes whimpering Joe grabs his hair turning his face

up

JOE
Let go Let go of the table

Joe slaps him but Towny clings more fiercely to the table as
Joe tries to jerk it free Joe strikes him with his fist

TOWNY
I deserved that I know I did

But he clutches the table wildly His mothers picture falls
unnoticed Joe stands in panic sickened unable to fulfill
the role Towny has assigned him

TOWNY (CONTD)
I brought this on myself Im
bleeding my nose is bleeding
isnt it
Townys eyes shine teeth clenched in a crazy smile blood
trickling from his nose Suddenly Joe jerks the lamp free of
its socket

JOE
You wanna gimme fifty-seven dollars
or you wanna busted skull

Towny simply stares at the lamp

JOE (CONTD)
Please let go of that table

Joe threatens swings the lamp down but stops short of
hitting Towny Towny shrieks -- eyes rolling back as he falls
limp -- loosing his grip on the table leaning on the bed
laughing and crying hysterically Joe has to step over him to
reach the wallet in the drawer He takes all the money --
probably twice what he needs -- desperate to get out of the
room

provoking Joe to glance back Towny is reaching for the
telephone his eyes on Joe with wild brightness holding his
hand on the receiver Joe knocks the phone from his hand
hits Towny in the mouth jerks the cord from the wall as
Towny falls -- gagging -- finally dislodging his dentures on
the carpet Joe stands sick and confused holding the useless
phone in two hands

EXT SMALL TOWN STREET - DAY

The bus is parked in the distance Joe comes from a clothing
store bare-headed wearing plain slacks and sport-shirt He
carries the boots Stetson and cowboy suit in one hand a

something rare and remarkable for Joe -- a simple human
contact without fear or threat a pleasant everyday
happening

INT GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe and Ratso have moved to the seat farthest back wider
than the others Joe blocks the view of the other passengers
as he helps Ratso into a new pair of corduroy pants and a
Florida shirt In the middle of the operation Ratso dozes
off Joe shakes his head scowling annoyed but continues
lifting Ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist
Ratso awakens as Joe zips the fly

RATSO
Hey what the hell you doing

They both smile It isnt funny enough to laugh at Joe

Palm trees are streaking past the window The sun is glaring
hot A group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the
bus as it passes

INT GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Ratsos eyes squint in a dazed half-sleep Joe leans across
to pull down the shade He hesitates a moment watching

past his reflection a group of young men on their way to
work carrying lunch pails dressed exactly as Joe is now
dressed

then Joe lowers the blind and seats himself Ratso nods
slightly his voice practically inaudible

RATSO

Surreptitiously Joe takes out a cigarette turns his face
away from Ratso and lights it hiding it cupped in his hand
as he smokes

JOE (CONTD)
Yeah guess thats what Im gonna
do

They ride for a moment in semi-darkness Joe smoking looking
at the other people on the bus brighter without the shades
down Joe turns checking the blanket around Ratso noticing
that Ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff awkward
position Joe leans over to straighten Ratsos head blocking
our view for a moment Then Joe leans back frowning
thoughtful We still do not see Ratsos face Joe rises
slowly starting forward in the bus

passing an older couple a schoolgirl two ladies with
straw hats a young man trying to read pausing when he
reaches

the DRIVER staring out at the Sunshine Parkway with the
Driver leaning over so he wont have to speak too loudly
