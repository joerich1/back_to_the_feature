A TITLE CARD SAYS THE BERTOLINI
i EVENING PENSION ROOM WITH A VIEW THROUGH WINDOW

The view is across the Arno towards the church of San
Miniato with the foothills of the Appenines beyond A
few tiny figures - men horses and carriages - can be
glimpsed and a few lights It is peaceful and still
except for the turbulent river itself swollen with
spring rains and melting snow from the mountains It
churns and crashes against the bridges and quays a
wild torrent contained within the stone constraints of
one of historys greatest cities Florence

An OLD MAN inhabitant of the pension room enters the
frame and stands looking out of the window

After a few moments a YOUNG MAN also enters and goes
to stand at the window As he does so the OLD MAN
transfers his look and now searches the face of the
YOUNGER MAN briefly These two are MR EMERSON and
his son GEORGE

A dinner gong sounds The OLD MAN turns at once and
disappears leaving the YOUNG MAN by himself He
continues to look down at the river

2 EVENING INTERIOR PENSION ROOM WITH NO VIEW

cU LUCY - she is opening a window shutter to look out
there is an expression of eager anticipation on her
pretty young face

We watch this expression abruptly change to one of dis-
appointment she also utters an exclamation of
disappointment at what she sees

POV LUCY - the window she has opened looks out on nothing
more exciting than a dark dreary courtyard with some
washing slung across it

fhe dinner gong is sounding

She is joined at the window by CHARLOTTE an English
spinster In contrast to LUCYs expression of keen
disappointment CHARLOTTE looks only grimly disapproving

CHARLOTTE
This is not what we were led
to expect

LUCY
I thought we were going to see
the Arno

CHARLOTTE
The Signora distinctly wrote
south rooms with a view close
together instead of which she
has given us north rooms a
long way apart Come dear or
we shall miss our dinner on top
of everything else

They turn from the window to go out -

CHARLOTTE
She had no business to do it
no business at all

EVENING PENSION CORRIDOR AND STAIRS

These too are disappointing - they might as well be in
any over-furnished under-ventilated somewhat down-at-
heel Victorian English boarding house

CHARLOTTE is sniffing the air She proceeds with
caution leading the way as if someone might jump out
of a dark corner and carry LUCY off

A buxom smiling Italian peasant GIRL passes them on
the stairs with her chambermaid paraphernalia She
says Buona Sera

LUCY returns her greeting and looks after her with
pleasure - but CHARLOTTE continues her dignified descent

CHARLOTTE
Any nook does for me but it does
seem hard that you shouldnt have
a view

LUCY
(with a touch of irritation) No
of course you must have a view
too

They have reached the dining room and enter it
DAY INTERIOR PENSION DINING ROOM

As in any stuffy English boarding house it has heavy
furniture portraits of Queen Victoria and Lord Tennyson
an apidistra and plush curtains heavy and sombre with
dust and the smell of gravy The guests seated at the
long table include MISS LAVISH the MISS ALANS MR
EMERSON GEORGE EMERSON and four or five other GUESTS
equally unmistakably English tourists taking their
evening meal The women outnumber the men three to one

The table is laid with an almost white tablecloth huge
silverplate cruets and bottles of water alternating with
bottles of red wine

The GUESTS are sawing away at their tough pieces of meat
with determination but also with true English boarding
house refinement Their acknowledgment of LUCY and
CHARLOTTE is equally genteel their eyes remain frozen
and the inclination of the head by way of welcome is
barely perceptible

LUCY and CHARLOTTE accept this cold and silent formality
as the correct behaviour toward two strangers who have
not yet proved themselves Silently and humbly they
slip into the two empty chairs

These are opposite MR EMERSON and GEORGE - who are
markedly different from the other guests Their recep-
tion of the newcomers is also different

MR EMERSON an elderly plump gentleman with childlike
eyes has his mouth full and so can only wave his fork
cheerily in their direction

They pretend not to see this

GEORGE doesnt look up from his plate at all but frowns
down at it in terrible concentration He is not eating
his food but arranging it on his plate as if it were some
mathematical problem he was struggling to solve

The awful silence which has greeted the new arrivals is
broken by MISS LAVISH - a middleaged bohemian blue-
stocking - continuing to expound the theme they have
interrupted

MISS LAVISH
It is only by going off the track
that you get to know the country
See the little towns - Gubbio
Pienza Cortono San Gimignano
Montriano (these names are
pronounced with an elaborate
Anglo-Italian flourish)

MR EMERSON is trying to attract the attention of a LADY
further down the table who is filling her glass from a
little bottle of her own

MR EMERSON
Miss Pole I say there - Miss
Pole
LADY
(looking at him with displeasure)
Yes Mr Emerson

MR EMERSON
I say whats that youre taking
Its not lemonade is it

LADY
It is lemonade Mr Emerson

MR EMERSON
(unaware of her disdain moved
only by genuine concern for her)
Put it away Miss Pole right
away Lemonade is nothing but
acidity - very bad for the stomach

A gasp from MISS CATHERINE ALAN an elderly spinster -
followed by a giggle that has to be stifled in her napkin

She is rebuked in a whisper by her sister TERESA an
even more elderly spinster

MISS CATHERINE
But he said - he said - the word
S Teresa

MISS TERESA
Its nothing to laugh at
Catherine On the contrary

MISS LAVISH
(continuing after the regrettable
interruption) We must get away
from that awful tourist idea that
Italy is only a museum of
antiquities and art

LADY
Have you seen Monteriano When
you visit the market there you
are far from the idea of a museum
«unless you want to call those
quaint stalls a living museum

ANOTHER LADY
A museum of types

LUCY and CHARLOTTE knowing they have not yet passed the
requisite test to enter into the general conversation
confine themselves to talking to each other in low voices

CHARLOTTE
I shall tell the Signora that
the first South room view avail-
able shall be given to you Lucy

LUCY
Why not to you Charlotte

CHARLOTTE
I insist on itThis meat has
surely been boiled for soup

MISS LAVISH
e«eMonteriano is not only quaint
but there one meets the Italians
unspoiled in all their simplicity
and charm

NIGHT PENSION SCULLERY

We get a glimpse of the urispoiled ITALIANS in all their
Simplicity and charm The plates come back from the
dining room with their unchewable bits of meat and other
refuse Some of this is flung straight to the dogs
underfoot who grab it while the dirty plates are tossed
into a sink full of grey greasy water There is much
banging and loud laughter the COOK swigs his wine and
pinches one of the SERVING GIRLS a LITTLE BOY cries as
he ladles prunes into glass dishes which are taken

away to the guests

NIGHT PENSION DINING ROOM

Unspoilt Monteriano is still the topic of conversation
as LUCY and CHARLOTTE continue to discuss the Signoras
perfidy

MISS CATHERINE
Isnt Monteriano where we saw the
violets Teresa An entire carpet
of them it was delightful I
find the violet the most delightful
of flowers dont you Miss Lavish

MISS LAVISH
I prefer something wilder bolder
- the reckless rose the tempestuous
tulip

CHARLOTTE
Your mother would never forgive me
if I took the view
LUCY
Mother would want you to have it

CHARLOTTE
On no account the view from
the Arno is yours

The two tired and out of sorts are working each other
up By now they both sound distinctly peevish

LUCY
I dont know why we are arguing
because we dont have it We
have no view

MR EMERSON
(leaning across the table toward
them) I have a view I have a
view

CHARLOTTE is startled Her glance passes over EMERSON
quickly but she doesnt really look at him His forward-
ness strikes her as uncouth and ill-bred

MR EMERSON
So does George - my son George
here

LUCY who is about to speak is repressed by CHARLOTTE
GEORGE continues to frown at the diagram he has arranged
on his plate

MR EMERSON
We both have rooms with views

CHARLOTTE
(looking over his head muttering
vaguely) Delightful - a view -
how very delightful

MR EMERSON
What I mean is that you can have
our rooms and well have yours
Well change

The other GUESTS fall silent Some appear shocked all
sympathize with the newcomers as MR EMERSON expands on
his offer

MR EMERSON
Why shouldnt you have them
Why shouldnt they have them
George Hm They want rooms
with views so they can have
ours Its very simple

LUCY gives a start of pleasure and gratitude CHARLOTTE
restrains her

CHARLOTTE
Thank you You are most kind
It is entirely out of the question

A murmur of approval from the rest of the table evidently
these newcomers as against the EMERSONS have the right
attitude and breeding

MR EMERSON
(getting red and excited) Its
the simplest thing on earth
isnt it George George They
want views we dont want them
Ergo they should have them

The whole table is attentive they are impressed by
CHARLOTTEs brilliantly correct handling of this
impossible situation and this impossible old man

CHARLOTTE
Thank you very much indeed We
could not impose on your kindness

MR EMERSON
(both fists planted on the table
in challenge) Why Theres no
kindness Only common sense

LUCY
You see we wouldnt like to -

CHARLOTTE
Eat your dinner dear

MR EMERSON
(thumping his fists like a naughty
child) Women like looking at a
view men dont George persuade
them

GEORGE
(without looking up) Its obvious
they should have the rooms Theres
nothing else to say

LUCY regards him with covert curiosity He looks
brooding perplexed - but also very handsome in a
rugged manly way
MR EMERSON
(attacking CHARLOTTE almost
violently) Why shouldnt you
change We can clear out in
half an hour 15 minutes

Its ridiculous - these niceties
they contravene common sense
every kind of sense

CHARLOTTE places her knife and fork together neatly on
her empty plate She has the air of a martyr - but one
firm and strong in resolve

MR EMERSON is now talking to the table at large waving
his arms about -

MR EMERSON
I dont care for what I see
outside

CHARLOTTE looks around her as much as to say Are you
all like this And the two MISSES ALAN who are sitting
further up the table with shawls hanging over the backs
of their chairs look back clearly indicating We are
not we are genteel

CHARLOTTE
(regarding the pudding plate
placed in front of her) No
thank you

She is pressing LUCYs foot under the table

MR EMERSON
(thumping his heart) Here is
where the birds sing here is
where the sky is blue

CHARLOTTE
(whispering) Lets go Lucy

She gets up with resolution

Her exit is very different from her entrance She is
acknowledged by the OTHERS with murmurs of warmth and
friendliness CHARLOTTE has proved herself

LUCY has to follow her But as she goes she turns once
and makes a hasty bow - a shamefaced acknowledgment - to
the EMERSONS

Only GEORGE sees it and he replies by raising his
eyebrows and smiling in a strange quizzical way

LUCY confused blushing not knowing what to make of
this smile hurries after CHARLOTTE

NIGHT INTERIOR PASSAGE BETWEEN DINING AND
DRAWING ROOMS

Once outside here the stately and victorious CHARLOTTE
collapses

CHARLOTTE
What an impossible pezson

LUCY
He meant to be kind - I dont
understand you -

CHARLOTTE
Please leave it to me I know
how to deal with such people

LUCY
Charlotte you dealed rudely
You dealed wrongly

CHARLOTTE does not acknowledge that she has dealt wrongly
and says grimly

CHARLOTTE
This pension is a failure Tomorrow
well make a change

Her tone of nanny-knows-best goads LUCY to further anger
and in this heated state they enter the drawing room

NIGHT INTERIOR PENSION DRAWING ROOM

This room with its tightly stuffed round tomato-red
chairs and armchairs does its best to reproduce the
solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding house

MR BEEBEE an English clergyman with a bald head and red
whiskers is seated there with an English newspaper which
he lowers at the tempestuous entrance of the TWO LADIES

At the sight of him their anger with each other turns
into a sort of hysterical relief

They exclaim they rush up to him they appear to be
surrounding him -

LUCY
Why its Mr Beebee Oh how
perfectly lovely Oh Charlotte
we must stop now however bad
the rooms are

CHARLOTTE
(with more restraint) How do you
do Mr Beebee

He has risen in amazement The TWO WOMEN start explaining
simultaneously

LUCY
Dont you remember us -

CHARLOTTE
Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch
We met at Tunbridge Wells when you
came to help our vicar -

LUCY
- That very cold Easter

LUCY is in a state of what might be called spiritual
starvation As Forster says she would have been glad
to see the waiter if CHARLOTTE had permitted it She
rushes on

LUCY
Just fancy how small the world
is Ive heard from Mother that
you are to be our vicar -

CHARLOTTE
Miss Honeychurch will be one of
your parishioners -

Lucy
At Summer Street -

Slowly MR BEEBEE gets all this straightened out He
welcomes them pleasantly

MR BEEBEE
Quite right - I move into the
rectory at Summer Street in
June

LUCY
Our house is called Windy Corner
- oh I am so glad to see you

CHARLOTTE exhausted by strong emotion sinks into one
of the tomato chairs

The two MISS ALANS enter and go up to CHARLOTTE
MISS CATHERINE

We did feel so sorry for you
in the dining room
MISS TERESA
Mr Emerson is so tactless

LUCY
But he meant to be kind (to
MR BEEBEE) This old gentleman
- and his son - kindly offered
us their rooms with a view For
ours which have no view

MR BEEBEE
(judiciously weighing the situation)
I see

TERESA

It was most indelicate

CATHERINE
But things that are indelicate -
can sometimes be beautiful

LUCY
Oh yes Yes

CHARLOTTE
I am the chaperone of my young
cousin Lucy and it would be a
serious thing if I put her under
an obligation to people of whom
we know nothing

MR BEEBEE is thoughtful for a few moments

MR BEEBEE
I dont think much harm would
have come of accepting

LUCY
There Charlotte (or she only
looks this meaning)

CHARLOTTE
(pursing her mouth to MR BEEBEE)
So you think I ought to have
accepted their offer You think
I have been narrow-minded

MR BEEBEE
(who is used to pursed-mouth
females) Not at all I never
suggested that

He catches LUCYs imploring look -

MR BEEBEE
«e-Ll£ you will allow me I would
be happy to be your intermediary
with Mr Emerson

Everyone looks at CHARLOTTE who remains silent and tight-
lipped

MR BEEBEE
(gently) I think he would not
take advantage of your acceptance
nor expect any gratitude He has
rooms he does not value and he
thinks you would value them

LUCY
Charlotte please

CHARLOTTE

My own wishes dearest Lucy are
unimportant in comparison with
yours I am only here through
your kindness If you want me

to turn these gentlemen out of
their rooms I will do it Would
you then Mr Beebee kindly tell
Mr Emerson we accept his offer

MR BEEBEE bows and departs with the message looking
irritated

LUCY
He is nice Just what I remember
He seems to see good in everyone
No one would take him for a

clergyman
9 NIGHT INTERIOR ROOM WITH VIEW
GEORGE is throwing his things together moving out of the
room
10 NIGHT INTERIOR ROOM WITHOUT VIEW

PORTER is shouldering baggage under CHARLOTTEs
supervision

CHARLOTTE
(to LUCY as they follow PORTER)
Remember Lucy I alone am implicated
in this

They go out into the passage

ll NIGHT INTERIOR UPSTAIRS PASSAGE

GEORGE with his baggage is coming from one side PORTER
with baggage and CHARLOTTE and LUCY following from the
other

A collision is imminent

CHARLOTTE
I do not wish the acceptance to
come from you (hissing so
that GEORGE who is now upon
them might not hear) Grant me
that at all events

There is now an impasse in the corridor and CHARLOTTE
talks her way around it

CHARLOTTE
to GEORGE) I would like to
thank your father personally for
his kindness to us

GEORGE
(skillfully maneuvering his way)
You cant Hes in his bath

CHARLOTTE gasps -

But GEORGE does not notice He has managed to get past
them and is on his way to his new room

LUCY following CHARLOTTE and PORTER is trying hard to
look serious

12 NIGHT INTERIOR ROOM WITH VIEW (CHARLOTTES)

LUCY is by the window breathing in the night air while
CHARLOTTE is arranging her things

CHARLOTTE
-Naturally of course I would
have given the larger room to you
but I happen to know that it was
the young mans -

As LUCY does not follow this reasoning -

CHARLOTTE
In my small way I am a woman of
the world and I know where things
lead to

Arranging her toilet accessories on the washstand she
is stopped short by the sight of a sheet of paper pinned
up over it It is scrawled with an enormous note of
interrogation

CHARLOTTE
What ever does it mean

LUCY comes and looks at it with her There is an
imperious knock on the door At LUCYs Come in
GEORGE enters He strides to the washstand He tears
down the sheet of paper Murmuring an awkward apology
he leaves with it The TWO WOMEN stare after him

MORNING LUCYS PENSION BEDROOM

LUCY is awake in her bed looking about her pleasant
room which Forster describes thus a bright bare
room with a floor of red tiles which look clean though
they are not with a painted ceiling whereon pink
griffins and blue amorini-sport in a forest of yellow
violins and bassoons LUCY takes this in (an
equivalent room will have to be found or decorated)
and then jumps out of bed

She goes to the window and with some difficulty gets the
shutters open squeezing her fingers in the process
When they open the room fills with sunlight and LUCY
looks at her VIEW She sees below as much of the
following as can be managed

Over the river men were at work with
spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore

and on the river was a boatAn electric

tram came rushing underneath the window

its platforms were overflowing with Italians
Children tried to hang on behindThen
soldiers appeared - goodlooking undersized
men - wearing each a knapsack covered with
mangy fur and a greatcoat which had been

cut for some larger soldier Beside them
walked officers looking foolish and fierce
and before them went little boys turning
somersaults in time with the band The tram-
car became entangled in their ranks and moved
on painfully like a caterpillar in a swarm

of ants One of the little boys fell down
and some white bullocks came out of an
archway

LUCYs enjoyment of this Saul Steinberg scene is cut short
by a tap on the door It is CHARLOTTE who comes in and
admonishes her on leaving her door unlocked and on her

leaning out of the window in her nightgown CHARLOTTE
tells her that if they dont hurry up the better part
of the day will be lost

14 DAY PENSION DINING ROOM

Most people have finished their breakfasts except for
MISS LAVISH who sits over her coffee with LUCY and
CHARLOTTE who are arguing CHARLOTTE wants to go out
but LUCY makes excuses in order to shake her off shes
feeling a wee bit tired shed like to settle in she
thinks shell play the piano etc CHARLOTTE offers to
stay in with her LUCY says that would never do Yes
yes No no etc When shes ready shell go out alone
CHARLOTTE cant allow this she must accompany LUCY
everywhere More Yes yes No no certainly not

MISS LAVISH
Being English Miss Honeychurch
will be perfectly safe Italians
understand A dear friend £ mine
Contessa Baroncelli has two
daughters and when she cannot
send a maid to school with them
she lets them go in sailor-hats
instead Everyone takes them for
English you see especially if
their hair is strained tightly
behind

15 DAY EXTERIOR FLORENCE BACK STREETS

MISS LAVISH very bohemian in a blue military cloak
swinging behind her is conducting CHARLOTTE through

the back streets of Florence These streets are intricate
and dirty and as they penetrate deeper into them MISS
LAVISH expresses herself more and more enchanted

MISS LAVISH
A smell a true Florentine smell
Inhale my dear deeper Every
city let me tell you has its
own smell

In another dirty alley

MISS LAVISH
How I love these little back
alleys Look at that adorable
wine-cart How the driver
stares at us dear simple soul

CHARLOTTE is evidently less entranced From time to time
she is forced to bring her handkerchief to her nose and

tread rather delicately around something indelicate on
the road As they make their way and pause from time
to time for MISS LAVISH to drink in local sensations we
hear the following snatches of conversation

MISS LAVISH
«»One has always to be open
wide open I think Miss Lucy is

CHARLOTTE
(nervously) Lucy - open To
what Miss Lavish

MISS LAVISH
To physical sensation

CHARLOTTE
Oh (a very ambiguous exclamation
- laden with both shock and
excitement)

MISS LAVISH
I will let you into a secret
Miss Bartlett I have my eye
on your cousin Miss Lucy
Honeychurch

CHARLOTTE
(thrilled yet apprehensive)
«For a character in your novel
Miss Lavish

MISS LAVISH
The Young English Girl transfigured
by Italy And why should she not
be transfigured It happened to
the Goths

In another part of the city

MISS LAVISH

I do declare were lost - no
Miss Bartlett I will not have
you look into your Baedeker
Two lone females in an unknown
townnow thats what I cali
an adventure We will simply
drift

They press on - CHARLOTTE somewhat drooping but MISS
LAVISH undaunted

Then as their destination rises up before them suddenly -

MISS LAVISH
Santa Maria del Fiore Buon
giorno Buon giorno Thou Holy
Maiden of the Dark Ages I salute
thee

Two BRITISH TOURISTS can be seen approaching the
Cathedral -

MISS LAVISH
Stop a minute Let those two
people go on or I shall have
to speak to themOh the
Britisher abroadIts very
naughty of me but I would set
an examination paper at Dover
and turn back every tourist who
couldnt pass it

Faced with the Cathedral CHARLOTTE surreptitiously
tries to look into her Baedeker again -

But MISS LAVISH shuts it and takes it away from her
with a skittish firmness to which CHARLOTTE delightedly
submits

Arm in arm with an air aimost of recklessness MISS
LAVISHs cloak swinging they scale the steps of the
Cathedral two British Ladies abroad

16 DAY INTERIOR PENSION PASSAGE AND STAIRS
Two more British Ladies abroad exhausted from a
mornings sightseeing the MISS ALANS have retreated
back to the pension and are wearily ascending the
stairs
Sounds of piano music from the drawing room Beethovens
Sonata in C minor Opus 111 played very well
The MISS ALANS open the door of their room -

17 DAY INTERIOR PENSION ROOM

They see the room brimming with violets - And MR EMERSON
filling more vases - And GEORGE wreathing the washstand -
The MISS ALANS advance bewildered -

MR EMERSON
Well - you said you like violets

GEORGE
So we brought you violets

MR EMERSON is so delighted with what he has done - and
indeed the violets are so beautiful - that the MISS

ALANS cannot help being delighted too They giggle like
two schoolgirls and encouraged by MR EMERSON they even
fix some flowers into their hair -

Sound of piano -

DAY INTERIOR PENSION DRAWING ROOM

LUCY is at the little draped piano playing Beethoven

She plays with verve and authority and seems intoxicated
by the music and her own playing of it

MR BEEBEE is listening to her with growing astonishment
When she has finished and he has applauded -

MR BEEBEE
May I say something - rather
daring

LUCY

Oh Mr Beebee you sound like
Miss Lavish Dont say you are
writing a novel too

MR BEEBEE
If I were you should be my heroine
and I would write If Miss
Honeychurch ever takes to live as
she plays it will be very exciting
- both for us and for her

LUCY doesnt know what he means As she moves over to
the window -

LUCY
Mother doesnt like me playing
Beethoven She says Im always
peevish afterward

And she does look - if not peevish then at least
restless looking out of the window

MR BEEBEE
Naturally One would be stirred
up Thats what music is for
Wont you play some more

LUCY
e-L think Ill go out (turning
from the window)

MR BEEBEE
What - alone Would that be
wise Miss Honeychurch

LUCY
Oh Mr Beebee to be wise one
might have stayed at home in
Summer Street -

Already half out of the door -

Lucy
I wont go far I promise

She has gone before he can say anything
DAY INTERIOR PENSION PASSAGE

LUCY has walked out so impetuously that she doesnt see
and nearly collides with MISS CATHERINE ALAN

Her apologies are as excited as her movement of exit -
But she doesnt stop

MISS CATHERINE astonished looks after her - then
enters the drawing room

DAY INTERIOR PENSION DRAWING ROOM

She sidles in characteristically made self-conscious
by the proximity of a lone man

MISS CATHERINE
Whatever is the matter with dear
Miss Lucy

MR BEEBEE
(watching LUCY from the window)
«eel put it down to too much
Beethoven

MISS CATHERINE joins him by the window

MR BEEBEE
(glancing down at her) You have
flowers in your hair Miss
Catherine like a pagan goddess

She picks them out smiling as she does so They both
watch LUCY

(If it is not possible because of the location to have
them looking out of a window then let them watch her

through the drawing room door as she makes her escape

via an entrance hall or courtyard)

TITLE CARD IN SANTA CROCE WITH NO BAEDEKER

DAY EXTERIOR STREETS OF FLORENCE

Contrary to what MISS LAVISH told her about English girls
in Italy she is very much noticed and appreciated MEN
look at her with admiration one or two try to speak to
her She either doesnt notice or pretends not to and
if she acts primly shes too pretty and youthful for
that to be a drawback in fact it seems almost a virtue

She might linger over the Andrea della Robbia Infants of
the Foundling Hospital in the Piazza dell Annunziata

DAY INTERIOR SANTA CROCE

LUCY wanders around in the barnlike interior shivering
with cold She has no Baedeker so does not know which
paintings and monuments to admire She walks about
somewhat disdainfully unwilling to be enthusiastic over
monuments of uncertain authorship or date But then she
gets interested in the place and the scene PRIESTS
BEGGARS GUIDES TOURISTS

She tries to puzzle out the Italian notices - one that
forbids people to introduce dogs into the church another
not to spit on the floor to cover the head or to uncover
it not to talk loudly to remember that the place is a
House of Worship etc

She watches other TOURISTS - the diligent foreigners
consulting their guidebooks looking from page to statue
and back again almost like spectators at a tennis match

She watches the ITALIANS at worship and particularly
some SMALL CHILDREN who seem to have got worship mixed
up with playing backwards and forwards over the recumbent
forms of some stone bishops

One CHILD falls
LUCY starts forward to pick him up MR EMERSON appears
bent on the same mission Between them they try - in
vain - to comfort the howling CHILD
MR EMERSON

Hateful bishop Hard in life

hard in death
The CHILD screams frantically

An Italian WOMAN takes charge and the CHILD is soon
running around again happily
She walks

She looks

MR EMERSON
(to WOMAN) You are a clever
woman Youve done more than
all the relics in the world

WOMAN
Niente
away
LUCY
Im not sure she understands
English
MR EMERSON

She understands everythingAre
you doing the church Why dont
you join us

around is he alone - or is the son with him

She sees GZORGE he is intently looking up at the
vaulted roof and doesnt see her

LUCY
(stiffly and taking refuge in
her dignity) Thank you very much
but I could not think of that I
really came to help with the child
and to thank you for so kindly
giving us your rooms last night
I hope that you have not been put
to any great inconvenience

MR EMERSON
(gently) My dear I think that you
are repeating what you have heard
older people say You are pretending
to be touchy but you are not really
Stop being so tiresome and tell me
instead what part of the church you
want to see To take you to it will
be a real pleasure

It is impossible for LUCY to take offense at this old
mans “impertinence and she stands hesitating He has
a nosegay of violets tucked into his lapel

LUCY
I am not touchy I hope I want
to see the Giottos - if only I
knew which they were

MR EMERSON
Come with me

LUCY follows MR EMERSON into the Peruzzi Chapel There
is a party of TOURISTS in the chapel led by MR EAGER
a clergyman

MR EMERSON greets him cordially then explains to LUCY
that it is Mr Eager the resident English chaplain in
Florence

MR EAGER
(lecturing to the TOURISTS)
Observe how Giotto in these
frescoes - now unhappily ruined
by restoration - is untroubled
by the snares of anatomy and
perspective

MR EMERSON
(pointing to the fresco of the
Ascension of St John) Yes look
at that fat man in blue He must
weigh as much as I do and he is
shooting into the sky like an air
balloon

MR EAGER resolutely ignores him and goes on instructing
his flock of TOURISTS who shift uneasily as does LUCY

MR EAGER
Remember the facts about this
church of Santa Croce how it was
built by faith in the full fervor
of mediaevalism -

MR EMERSON
Built by faith indeed That
simply means the workmen werent
paid properly

MR EAGER
(frigidly) Pardon me The chapel
is somewhat small for two parties
We will incommode you no longer

He leads his flock away
MR EMERSON
Stop Theres plenty of room
for us all Stop

The TOURISTS disappear without a word MR EMERSON looks
after them - but forgets about them as his eyes fall on -

GEORGE standing alone in gloomy abstraction At this
moment he is not an unattractive figure by any means

and in the shadows his face appears tender LUCY watches
him with feelings of interest for a few seconds and in
turn is observed by MR EMERSON

MR EMERSON
Look at my poor boy

LUCY looks away and blushes and doesnt want to listen
to what MR EMERSON is saying and yet does

MR EMERSON
Hes very unhappy

LUCY
But why should he be

MR EMERSON
Well may you askWhat more is
one to give him And think how
he has been brought up - free
from all the superstition that
leads men to hate one another in
the name of God

At this blasphemy LUCY tries to leave -

LUCY
(murmuring) I must go - my
cousin will be anxious -

MR EMERSON actually catches hold of her to prevent her

MR EMERSON
I dont require you to fall in
love with my boy but try and
understand him My poor young
lady I think youre muddled
too - youve let other people
muddle you

LUCY is impressed by the possible truth of this and she
now looks toward GEORGE with greater sympathy

LUCY
Is that whats happened to him
Has he let other people -

MR EMERSON
No in his case hes done it himself
- with all this brooding on the
things of the Universe I dont
believe in this world sorrow Do
you

LUCY
(unable to express herself yet
with conviction) No Ohno I
dont Mr Emerson Not at all

MR EMERSON
Well there you are Then make
my boy realise that by the side
of the everlasting Why there is
a yesi And a Yes and a Yes

This inflated oratory brings LUCY back to earth She
adopts a tone of solid suburban common sense

LUCY

Has your son no particular hobby
I generally forget my worries at

the piano and collecting stamps

did no end of good to Freddy my

brotherYou must excuse me Mr
Emerson my cousin will be most

anxious if I dont get back this

instant

MR EMERSONs face saddens He touches her gently with
his hand

MR EMERSON
Poor girl Poor girl

LUCY
(flaring up) Poor girl On the
contrary - I think myself a very
fortunate girl Im thoroughly
happy and having a splendid time
(in a tone of dismissal) Goodbye
Thank you both so much for all
your kindness

She hurries away not looking right or left and certainly
not at GEORGE

23 DAY EXTERIOR OUTSIDE SANTA CROCE
LUCY is hurrying away from the church - She enters a shop
24 DAY INTERIOR POSTCARD SHOP
LUCY buys postcards These are Giorgiones Tempesta
Fra Angelicos Coronation Giottos Ascension of St John
some Della Robbia babies some Guido Reni Madonnas She

considers Botticellis Birth of Venus for a long time
includes it then at the last moment decides against it

and puts it back in the rack She gets her change
muddled - almost forgets her packet - then goes out

DUSK EXTERIOR IN THE PIAZZA SIGNORIA

Now she is no longer in a hurry but lingers as if she
were waiting for someone or something to happen to her
She fixes her eyes on the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio
It arises out of the surrounding dusk like a pillar of
gold throbbing in the tranquil sky Absorbed in this
vision she doesnt notice what is going on around her

Two MEN very near her have started bickering by the
Loggia She only vaguely hears their cries of Cinque
lire Cinque lire They spar at each other -

One MAN is hit lightly on the chest He frowns he bends
toward LUCY as if he had an important message for her

He opens his lips to deliver it and a stream of blood
comes out and trickles down his unshaven chin

A CROWD rises up around them LUCY sees GEORGE looking
at her from out of this CROWD There are shouts and
cries The wounded MAN is lifted up and carried to the
fountain The MURDERER cries out and kisses him But
LUCY looking at GEORGE sees him grow dimGEORGE
pushing his way through the CROWD catches LUCY as she
falls He carries her in his arms to the steps of the
Uffizi Arcade He lowers her gently he supports her in
his arms he looks into her face

The hubbub around the fountain comes to them as if froma
great distance They seem to have moved into a world of
greater silence sitting there they appear like the
other statues in the arcade to be more than human - a
statue not merely of two lovers but of Eternal Lovers

LUCY opens her eyes She looks back into his face She
sits up He rises and dusts his knees

LUCY
Oh what have I done

GEORGE
You fainted

LUCY
I - I am very sorry

GEORGE
How are you now

LUCY
Perfectly well - absolutely well

GEORGE
Then lets come home Theres
no point in our stopping

He holds out his hand to help her up She pretends not to
see it

The cries from the fountain continue as a background to
this conversation

LUCY
How very kind you have been I
might have hurt myself falling
But now I am well I can go
alone thank you

He remains silent and his hand remains extended

LUCY
Oh my photographs

GEORGE
What photographs

LUCY
I bought some photographs at
Alinaris I must have dropped
them out there in the square
Would you be so very kind -
thank you so very much -

He nods brusquely then turns to go As soon as his back
is turned LUCY gets up with the cunning of a
maniac and steals down the arcade toward the Arno

GEORGE
Miss Honeychurch

She stops her hand on her heart

GEORGE
Sit still you arent fit to
go home alone

LUCY
Yes I am thank you so very much

GEORGE
No you arent

LUCY
But I had rather -

GEORGE
Then I dont fetch your photo-
graphs

A pause He tells her commandingly

GEORGE
Sit down The man is dead

Bewildered she obeys him

GEORGE
And dont move till I come back

LUCY sits on the steps

She sees the black-hooded FIGURES of the Fraternity of
the Misericordia passing like figures in a dream The
hubbub around the fountain also seems heard as if ina
dream

LUCY doesnt know what is happening or what has happened
She buries her face in her hands

GEORGE finds the packet of photographs lying on the pave-
ment The envelope is covered with blood He hesitates
looks in LUCYs direction then wipes the blood off with
his handkerchief and goes back to her with the cards

When GEORGE returns LUCY pulls herself together She
becomes brisk English suburban again She rises
without assistance and walks without assistance toward
the Arno

DUSK EXTERIOR EMBANKMENT

LUCY is babbling on rather breathlessly while GEORGE
strides beside her in his usual impenetrable silence

LUCY
--italians are so very odd
arent they So excitable Only
yesterday I heard about another
murder - I dont know the details
but a poor little boy was involved
And yet they seem so kind and
lovable Its too extraordinary
that they should at the same time
be so violent - Mr Emerson

He turns toward her frowning as if she has disturbed
him in some abstract quest

LUCY
I want to ask you something
before we go in

She stops and leans her elbows on the parapet of the
embankment by the Ponte alle Grazie He does the same
In their identity of position they again suggest
something abstract more than human - an embodiment

of Eternal Companionship

LUCY
(moving her elbows) I was never
so much ashamed of myself in my
life I cannot think what came
over me

GEORGE
Perfectly natural I nearly
fainted myself

LUCY
Well I owe you a thousand
apologies

GEORGE accepts them in silence

LUCY
«And - this is what I wanted
to ask you - you know how silly
people are gossiping - (with a
nervous laugh) ladies especially
I am afraid - you understand
what I mean

GEORGE
Im afraid I dont

LUCY
(with a sigh that such indelicate
explanation should be necessary)
I mean would you not mention it
to anyone - my foolish behaviour

He throws something into the river with an abrupt
movement

LUCY
What was thatWhat did you
throw in

GEORGE

(crossly) Things I didnt want

LUCY
Mr EmersonWhere are the
photographsI believe it was
my photographs you threw away

GEORGE
(suddenly bewildered turning
toward her like an anxious boy)
I didnt know what to do with
themThey were covered with
blood There now Ive told you

They both stand again as before side by side with their
elbows on the parapet They look down into the river
which has swirled away her bloodied photographs After
a long silence -

GEORGE
(speaking slowly out of deep
thought) Something tremendous
has happened It isnt exactly
that a man has died - but some-
thing else too

LUCY looks into his face as he tries to express himself
Who knows in what direction his thoughts will go next
She attempts to stop him before he can say more

LUCY
Well thank you again How
quickly these accidents do
happen and then one returns
to the old life

GEORGE
I dont

She looks at him anxiously

GEORGE
Something has happened to me
I dont know And perhaps to
you

She is silent she doesnt disclaim it nor does she move
away but continues to stand beside him her elbows like
his on the parapet contemplating the River Arno whose
roar is suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears

On a common impulse without passing a word or look

they turn away

DAY EXTERIOR PIAZZA SIGNORIA

CHARLOTTE and LUCY are on their way back to the pension
from the bank CHARLOTTE with the complacency of fate

leads them into the Piazza Signoria LUCY hangs back
but CHARLOTTE keeps on oblivious

The exact site of the murder is occupied by MISS LAVISH
She has the morning newspaper in her hand She hails
them briskly

MISS LAVISH
Aha Miss Honeychurch Im in
luck Now you are to tell me
absolutely everything that you
saw from the beginning

LUCY pokes at the ground with her parasol

MISS LAVISH
But perhaps you would rather not

LUCY
Im sorry If you could manage
without it

The elder LADIES exchange approving glances it is suitable
that a girl should feel deeply

MISS LAVISH
Its I who am sorry We literary
hacks are shameless creatures

She marches cheerfully to the fountain and back counting
steps

MISS LAVISH
Ive been in the Piazza since
eight oclock collecting material
The two men quarrelled over a five
lira note (in the throes of
creation and making a dramatic
announcement) For the five lira
note Im going to substitute a
young lady It will raise the tone
of the tragedy

LUCY looks uncomfortable

CHARLOTTE
What is the plot

MISS LAVISH
(grandly) Love murder abduction
revenge Andate via Sono occupato

A VENDOR of panoramic photographs has approached holding
out his wares with a courteous smile

While MISS LAVISH is engaged with the VENDOR LUCY takes
Ne the opportunity to say to CHARLOTTE in a quick aside
LUCY

Charlotte Heres an idea
What if we popped off to Rome
tomorrow - straight

CHARLOTTE
Oh you droll person

MISS LAVISH
I confess that in Italy my
sympathies are not with my own
countrymen Let me give you
fair warning I intend to be
unmerciful to the British tourist

CHARLOTTE
You wicked woman Im sure you
are thinking of the Emersons

MISS LAVISH continues her pacing shadowed by the VENDOR

’ LUCY
Do lets go Im sick of Florence

CHARLOTTE

Your mother would have a fine
bone to pick with me if we left
D Florence without a single visit
to the Pitti Palace (affec-
tionately pressing her hand) It
was yesterdays shock - we must
put it right out of our minds

MISS LAVISH
(returning with the VENDOR) I
repeat and I insist a tragedy
such as yesterdays is not the
less tragic because it happened
in humble life Andante presto
Presto

She strikes at the proffered view with her rolled-up
newspaper and it tears The VENDOR puts up a wail
Under cover of this

LUCY
I just want to be with you - all
the time Promise not to leave
me Promise

CHARLOTTE
There There Your dull old
Charlottes here

MISS LAVISH
Ignore him

She strides out and the VENDOR hurries after her holding
up his damaged view an end in each hand OTHERS look

in their direction as the air rings with his threats and
lamentations He appeals to LUCY From a distance we
see him being paid off and moilified

Charlotte Bartlett and Miss Lucy Honeychurch
Drive out in Carriages to See a View
Italians Drive them

28 DAY EXTERIOR ROAD THROUGH TUSCAN LANDSCAPE

Two carriages are driving upward to Fiesole through a
glorious landscape of flowering hills and valleys In
the carriage in front are MR EAGER (the English
chaplain we already met) and MR EMERSON LUCY and MISS

’ LAVISH Their Italian COACHMAN is young and handsome
and in a sprightly mood

In the following carriage MR BEEBEE GEORGE
CHARLOTTE

A beautiful Italian GIRL - Persephone personified the
reigning goddess of the Tuscan spring - is standing
waiting at a curve of the upward winding road She is
shielding her eyes against the sun as she looks toward
the ascending carriages When the first carriage
reaches her she nimbly climbs up beside the COACHMAN
and they go careering on The COACHMAN slips the left
rein over her head enabling him to drive with his arm
around her waist MR EAGER taps the COAHCMAN on the
back when he notices this

COACHMAN
(turning around with an ingra-
tiating smile) She is my sister

MR EAGER
«Im not sure we ought to allow
this it is the thin end of the
wedge

The LADIES intercede on their behalf

They drive on The two GENTLEMEN have their backs to
the horses MR EAGER is expounding MR EMERSON is
falling asleep Facing them MISS LAVISH is listening
to MR EAGER and LUCY elegantly dressed in white is
watching the COACHMAN shamelessly making love to his
GIRL

MR EAGER
So Miss Honeychurch you are
travelling As a student of
art

LUCY
Oh dear me no - oh no

MISS LAVISH
Perhaps as a student of human
nature like myself

LUCY
Im here as a tourist

MR EAGER

Are you indeed If you will

not think me rude we residents
sometimes pity you poor tourists
not a little - handed about like
a parcel of goods from Venice to
Florence from Florence to Rome
quite unconscious of anything
that is outside Baedeker - their
one anxiety to get “done or
through and go on somewhere
else

MISS LAVISH
(over the preceding) I abhor
Baedeker If it were left to me
every copy would be flung into
the Arno -

MR EAGER
- towns rivers palaces all
mixed up in one inextricable
whirl - Over there please
observe Miss Honeychurch the
villa of my dear friend Lady
Helen Laverstock who is at
present busy over Fra Angelico
- a definitive study -

MISS LAVISH fixes her pincenez with eager interest but
LUCY has difficulty tearing her eyes away from the two
LOVERS on the drivers seat who are enjoying themselves
and the ride tremendously

MR EAGER
On the right - no just there -
Mr Henry Burrage lives An
American of the best type - so
rare - Doubtless you know his
monographs in the series of
Mediaeval Byways Piano
Piano (waving his hand
elegantly over his head with-
out turning around)

COACHMAN
Va bene signore va bene va
bene

He whips the horses up again The dozing MR EMERSON
is flung against MR EAGER who makes a long-suffering
face

In the second carriage MR BEEBEE is trapped with a
silent GEORGE and a prim CHARLOTTE doing her best to
keep her hat in place as the second COACHMAN urges his
horses to keep up with the others

MR BEEBEE
Do you know who that is leading
us Phaeton himself I recog-
nized him at once Phaeton in
Tuscany driving a cab

CHARLOTTE
(less enthusiastic) Oh yes
Quite (trying to engage GEORGE
in conversation) Your father I
believe Mr Emerson is a

journalist
GEORGE
Used to be
CHARLOTTE
And you yourself if I might -
GEORGE
On the railways
CHARLOTTE
I see
MR BEEBEE

(hastily covering up) Phaeton
in all his classical purity
untouched alike by the Age of
Faith and the Age of Doubt
ee

We see PHAETON and PERSEPHONE the wind blowing their
hair a young God and Goddess

In the first carriage MR EAGER is still talking though
somewhat incommoded by MR EMERSON asleep lurching
against him

MR EAGER
You know the American girl in
Punch who says Say Poppa
what did we see at Rome And
the father replies Why guess
Rome was the place where we saw
the yaller dog Theres
travelling for you Ha hal
Ah What Stop At once

For turning around in an inauspicious moment he has
caught the COACHMAN kissing his GIRL

In his fluent but execrable Italian MR EAGER orders
the GIRL to be taken down from the carriage

COACHMAN and GIRL plead and protest
MR EMERSON has woken up and asks what has happened

LUCY leans forward and tells him in a whisper He looks
pleased The second carriage draws up behind them and
MR BEEBEE leans out to ask what has happened

MR EAGER
Please - I know how to deal with
these people (deaf to the pleas
of the lovers he insists that
the girl must descend)

MISS LAVISH
I daresay I shall receive scant
support but I would let them be
I have always flown in the face
of convention all my life

MR EAGER
(over the above) We must not
submit He is treating us as
if we were a party of Cooks
tourists

This silences MISS LAVISH

MR EMERSON
Leave them alone Do we find
happiness so often that we should
turn it off the box when it
happens to sit there

He pats them on the back to signify his approval

COACHMAN
(to LUCY) Signorina

PERSEPHONE
Signorina

She points at the other carriage LUCY looks and sees
GEORGE there For a moment the two GIRLS look at each
other

But MR EAGER is adamant and the GIRL gets down from the
box

They drive on - the COACHMAN now very surly and jolting
them as hard as he can PERSEPHONE is left by the
roadside

DAY EXTERIOR VARYING ASPECTS OF MOUNTAIN
SCENERY BETWEEN FIESOLE AND THE CASTELLO DI VINCIGLIATA

The carriages have arrived the OCCUPANTS descend From
their eminence they see a hollow like a great amphi-
theatre full of terraced steps and misty olives They
climb up into the hills splitting off into different
groups -

MR BEEBEE directs the COACHMAN where to place the
picnic hamper

He is joined by MR EAGER

MR EMERSON tries to have a conversation in halting
Italian with the disgruntled COACHMAN

GEORGE is openly waiting for LUCY to join him

But she hurries away from his uncompromising figure to
follow CHARLOTTE and MISS LAVISH -

These two are walking close together engrossed in a
whispered conversation which sometimes breaks into
stifled laughter They are talking about GEORGE
EMERSONs unfortunate occupation we only catch some
of their words

MISS LAVISH
(gasping) The railway Oh I
shall die Of course it was the
railway He is the image of a
porter - on - on the South-
Eastern

CHARLOTTE
(plucking at her) Eleanor be
quiet Theyll hear - the
Emersons

MISS LAVISH
(more giggling) I cant stop
Let me go my wicked way A
porter -

CHARLOTTE
Eleanor

LUCY who has been walking close enough behind them to
hear all this speaks up with spirit

LUCY
Im sure its all right The
Emersons wont hear and they
wouldnt mind if they did

MISS LAVISH is not pleased by this

MISS LAVISH
(rather crossly) Miss Honey-
church listening Pouf Wouf
You naughty girl Go away

CHARLOTTE
Oh Lucy Im sure Mr Eager
wants to explain the landscape
to you -

LUCY
(stubbornly) I cant find him
now and I dont want to either

They have to resign themselves to her presence
DAY EXTERIOR ON THE ROAD

GEROGE has remained by the carriages He draws a large
question mark in the dirt with a stick Then he wipes
it out and instead draws the letters Y E S

Abruptly he plunges down the bank away from the others
and cheerful and athletic makes his way to an
eminence overlooking the Val DArno and distant
Florence He tries out the echo

At first he gives an Ooooh sound but then replaces
it with these words which now ring over the hillside

GEORGE
(shouting) Liberty - Truth -
Beauty - Love

DAY EXTERIOR LITTLE VALLEY

The words resound among the tea-cups of the two
CLERGYMEN and MR EMERSON around the hamper

MR BEEBEE
Is that your son Could it
be the silent dour George

MR EMERSON
Hes saying his creed

MR EAGER
One more lump if I might
trouble you Mr Beebee thank
you
GEORGES VOICE Beauty

MR EMERSON
He is declaring the eternal Yes

MR EAGER
And a spoon if there is one

GEORGES VOICE Love
DAY EXTERIOR BEAUTIFUL SPOT 2

GEORGES VOICE (or its echo) also reaches the three
LADIES

Only LUCY is attentive to it
MISS LAVISH is busy spreading two mackintosh squares
CHARLOTTE
From Weybridge you say How
very odd
MISS LAVISH
Weybridge Surrey - on her very
first visit to Italy
GEORGES VOICE Love

LUCY
Whats that

CHARLOTTE
Oh the gentlemen are doubltess
having a game - why dont you
go and find them

LUCY
Because I want to stop here
with you

MISS LAVISH
(lowering herself onto a
mackintosh square) Observe my
foresight I never venture out
without my mackintosh squares
for at any time one may have to
sit on damp ground or cold marble

CHARLOTTE
Lucy - take the other one the
ground will do for me

LUCY protests - in vain CHARLOTTE sits on the ground

CHARLOTTE
Really I have not had rheumatism
for years and if I do feel it
coming on I shall stand up
And she never went back to Weybridge

MISS LAVISH
Her friend had to return alone
while she remained in Monteriano

CHARLOTTE
And she really -

MISS LAVISH nods but cannot say more because of LUCYs
presence

CHARLOTTE
(clearing her throat) Now dont
be alarmed this isnt a cold
Its the tiniest cough and I
have had it three days Its
nothing to do with sitting here

at all

LUCY
Oh very well I shail join Mr
Eager

CHARLOTTE

Do dear he will be pleased
(hardly waiting for her to be
out of earshot) And she really
married this Italian

MISS LAVISH
In the church at Monteriano A
youth ten years younger than
herself

DAY EXTERIOR BY THE ROAD

LUCY in search of the others addresses herself to the
COACHMEN who are sprawling in the carriages smoking
cigars

LUCY
Dove

The first COACHMAN nods at her radiantly

LUCY
(struggling with her Italian)
Dove buoni uomini

He knows perfectly He is ready and able to conduct her
He adjusts his hat encourages his moustache and with
the graciousness of a host invites her to follow him

She does so for the first time really enjoying the
landscape

DAY EXTERIOR BEAUTIFUL SPOT 2

CHARLOTTE and MISS LAVISH on their mackintosh squares
They are now in a pensive mood

MISS LAVISH
«eel have a theory that there is
something in the Italian landscape
which inclines even the most stolid
nature to romance

CHARLOTTE
(regarding landscape) It reminds
me somewhat of the country around
Shropshire where I once spent a
holiday at the home of my friend
Miss Apesbury

MISS LAVISH
And - I divine it - Charlotte you
had an adventure there Vain to
deny it

CHARLOTTE is blushing confused happy under MISS
LAVISHs teasing

DAY EXTERIOR ON THE WAY TO EMINENCE

COACHMAN stops to pick some violets and presents them
to LUCY She takes them with real pleasure They walk
on The view is forming LUCY sees the river the
golden plain other hills

COACHMAN
Eccolo

LUCY gives a cry - the ground has given way and she falls
on to a little terrace covered with violets from end to
end It is like a sea of violets foaming down the
hillside

Standing on the brink of this sea like a swimmer about
to dive is GEORGE

GEORGE contemplates LUCY - who appears to have fallen out
of heaven into this sea of violets which beats against
her dress in blue waves

The COACHMAN watches them from behind the bushes a
violet between his teeth

GEORGE steps forward quickly and kisses LUCY (on the
cheek)

CHARLOTTES VOICE calling “Lucy Lucy

They look up and see her standing brown against the view
Then CHARLOTTE spies the COACHMAN in the bushes He
stares at all three maybe laughing unabashedly

DAY EXTERIOR DESCENDING FROM FIESOLE

The clouds are massing over the landscape in a
threatening way There is distant thunder The wind
has come up

CHARLOTTE holding on to LUCY asks MISS LAVISH to go in
the other carriage and pointedly asks MR EAGER to get
in with them When he has done so and before GEORGE
can take his place CHARLOTTE tells the COACHMAN 1
(PHAETON) to start out LUCY cries out and stands up
as the carriage moves until she is pulled down to
safety

The OCCUPANTS of the other carriage begin to rearrange
themselves to make room for GEORGE Instead of getting
in he waves them on good-naturedly The second
carriage goes

GEORGE
(shouting after it to his father)
Ill walk

MR EMERSON protests points to the threatening sky
but GEORGE sturdily strides off

The carriages rattle off MR EMERSON continuing to
shout to GEORGE to induce him to ride with them

But GEORGE cheerfully waves them on

DAY EXTERIOR ON THE ROAD

“The storm is gathering GEORGE seems to enjoy it -

eagerly looking up as though inviting the elements to
break

When the rain begins to pour down he takes off his hat
and raises his face to the rain and lets it soak into
him

DAY EXTERIOR FIESOLE ROAD

In the carriage CHARLOTTE and LUCY are huddled together
under an inadequate parasol Their hands are inter-
twined LUCY now appears to be clinging to CHARLOTTE
for protection

Rain and darkness have come on together There is a
flash of lightning and LUCY screams MR EAGER addresses
her professionaly

MR EAGER
Courage Miss Honeychurch courage
and faith Do you suppose that
all this immense electrical display
is simply called into existence
to extinguish you or me

LUCY
No - of course -

MR EAGER
Even from the scientific standpoint
the chances against our being
struck are enormous The steel
picnic knives the only articles
which might attract the current
are in the other carriage And
in any case

There is an explosion on the road The storm has struck
the overhead wire of the tramline and one of the great

supports falls moments before the carriages arrive at
the spot They stop

Everyone descends from the carriages and embrace each
other joyfully It has been a miraculous preservation
The COACHMEN shout in wonder and cross themselves

Very excited MR EMERSON insists they must return to
pick up GEORGE

MR EMERSON
The boy may lose his way He
may be killed

MR BEEBEE and MR EAGER attempt to calm him

MR EAGER
(gently) We must have faith

There is a great crash of thunder

MR EMERSON
(appealing to MISS LAVISH) But
he may be killed

MR EAGER
(sotto voce to MR BEEBEE as
he is helping the other LADIES
back into the carriage) Typical
behaviour In the presence of
reality that kind of person
invariably breaks down

MR BEEBEE
The old gentleman is anxious
for his son

They lead him to the other carriage and put him into it

LUCY CHARLOTTE and their COACHMAN are again huddled in
their carriage

CHARLOTTE
(pointing to COACHMAN whispering)
He saw - but you may leave him to
me

She taps his back He turns around She fumbles in her
purse - then proffers him a franc

CHARLOTTE
(finger on lip) Silenzio

He turns back pocketing the franc

CHARLOTTE
Dont cry dearest

LUCY
»eIl have been worse than you
knowOnce by the river - the
day of the murder -

CHARLOTTE
Yes What Speak dear

LUCY
«Oh but he isnt killed - he
wouldnt be killed would he
Charlotte

CHARLOTTE
I trust not One would always
pray against that

MR EAGER gets back in He gives them a sharp look as
if he suspects something

The carriages ride on LUCYs tears mingling with the
rain

NIGHT INTERIOR PENSION PASSAGE AND STAIRS

CHARLOTTE is arguing with the cockney SIGNORA who is
demanding a whole weeks rent

CHARLOTTE is firm in offering half a weeks rent - Then
walks sedately up the stairs not turning around or
quickening her step in spite of the SIGNORAs protests
pursuing her

NIGHT INTERIOR THE ROOM WITH A VIEW

Half-packed suitcases and a trunk stand open The rain
is pouring down outside One candle burns on a chest of
drawers casting monstrous and fantastic shadows on the
bolted door as CHARLOTTE brushes LUCYs hair making
her hand with the brush appear like the threatening
appendage of some giant insect raising and lowering
Out of the sound of the rain and the brushing we finally
hear CHARLOTTE speak

CHARLOTTE
So what is to be done

No answer The brushing continues

CHARLOTTE
What is to be done You alone
can decide

A tram roars by in the dark LUCY looks sad and finally
says

LUCY
It has been raining for nearly
four hours

CHARLOTTE ignores this and continues brushing with
determination She doesnt do it well and frequently
pulls LUCYs hair But LUCY is in her power

CHARLOTTE

How do you propose to silence him
LUCY

The driver
CHARLOTTE

My dear girl no Mr George
Emerson I dont wish to judge
him uncharitably - but I know
he will talk

Lucy
He will not He never talks
One is fortunate to get as much
as a yes or a no out of hin

CHARLOTTE
Unfortunately I have met the
type before (looking at
CHARLOTTE its hard to believe
this and LUCY doesnt) They
seldom keep their exploits to
themselves

LUCY
(wincing from the word not the
tugs) Exploits

CHARLOTTE looks grim with superior knowledge
LUCY
(getting up suddenly and going
to the window) Very well Ill
speak to him

CHARLOTTE utters a cry of alarm at this

LUCY
(peering out of the window) He
should have been here at least
an hour ago even if he did walk
all the way

CHARLOTTE
Come away from the window dear
you will be seen from the road

LUCY
«eThe moment he comes I shall
face him

CHARLOTTE

You will do no such thing My
poor dear you are so young
you have always lived among
such nice people This
afternoon for example if I
had not arrived what would
have happened

LUCY
(very gravely) I cant think

She turns her back - to hide what expression on her face
CHARLOTTE looks at her back then persists

CHARLOTTE
Answer me Lucia What would
have happened if I had not
appeared

LUCY
(wheeling round to her now
frankly laughing) I told you
I cant think You did appear

CHARLOTTE
0 for your brother If only
Freddy were here he is young
but I know that his sisters
insult would rouse in him a very
lion (kneeling humbly by LUCYs
suitcase painfully packing in
silence for a while) I have
vexed you at every turn

LUCY makes an exclamation

CHARLOTTE
Yes yes - it is so Im too
old for you and too dull only
(MORE)

CHARLOTTE
fit to pack and unpack your
thingsIt will be a push to
catch the morning train but
we must try

LUCY
(dully) When does the train to
Rome go
CHARLOTTE
At eight
CHARLOTTE gets up
CHARLOTTE

I have failed in my duty to
your mother She will never
forgive me and rightly

With this uncompromising statement she resumes her
packing But all her busyness moving around the room
cannot hide the fact that she is alert to what LUCY is
going to answer LUCY answers nothing She has resumed
her watch by the window

CHARLOTTE
Your mother has been so generous
to me I shall never face her
again after this disaster

LUCY feels compelled to turn her attention again from
the window to CHARLOTTE

CHARLOTTE
I am here for your sake - by
your mothers generosity - yet
I have neglected you Your
mother will see this as clearly
as I do when you tell her Do
come away from the window

She struggles with the strap of LUCYs suitcase

LUCY realising that a new point has been made goes
over to her

CHARLOTTE
She will certainly blame me when
she hears of it (tightening
strap) Certainly and deservedly

LUCY
Why need mother hear of it

CHARLOTTE
But you tell her everything
(pause) Dont you

LUCY
I suppose I do generally

CHARLOTTE
There is such beautiful confi-
dence between you - one would
not want to break it And as
I have said I am to blame

LUCY
I wouldnt wish Mother to think
sO

CHARLOTTE
She will think soIf you tell
her

A pause Then LUCY says - unwillingly but with
resolution

LUCY
I will never speak of it either
to Mother or to anyone I
promise I will not

CHARLOTTE has successfully ended her struggle with the
Strap She gets up with satisfaction She pecks LUCY
on both cheeks

CHARLOTTE
Better get to bed dear We
have to make an early start
She goes As she is closing the door preposterously
she points at the bolt (or key) and by gesture tells
LUCY to lock it Then she shuts the door We hear her
footsteps in the corridor But LUCY doesnt move

She sits on the side of her bed Youthful joy has
drained out of her face

The doorbell rings LUCY starts
NIGHT INTERIOR ROOM WITH A VIEW - CHARLOTTES

CHARLOTTE stops her packing - she is lining the bottom
of a trunk with books - and goes to the window

NIGHT INTERIOR ROOM WITH A VIEW - LUCYS

So does LUCY in her room But she first blows out her
candle

NIGHT EXTERIOR PENSION
GEORGE who is standing outside the door looks up
But since LUCY is in the dark it is only CHARLOTTE
he sees at the window
A MAID SERVANT opens the door to him

He is very wet but radiant He greets the SERVANT with
such warmth that she smiles broadly back to him

NIGHT INTERIOR ROOM WITH A VIEW - LUCYS
LUCY hears him coming up the stairs

After a moments hesitation she strides to the door and
opens it boldly

NIGHT INTERIOR UPSTAIRS PASSAGE
GEORGE sees LUCY appearing at the door

But at the same moment the adjoining door opens and
CHARLOTTE appears

Now LUCY closes her door (The effect of the two figures
alternately appearing and disappearing is like that of
the two figures in a clock)
CHARLOTTE

I wish one word with you in the

drawing room Mr Emerson please
She leads the way to the drawing room He follows her
NIGHT INTERIOR ROOM WITH A VIEW - LUCYS

LUCY is getting undressed in a great hurry breathing
heavily with strong and angry feelings

She hears footsteps and then CHARLOTTEs voice Good
night Mr Emerson

LUCY listens to GEORGEs footsteps recede Then there
is absolute silence

In an access of fury LUCY flings her hairbrush against
the wall

CHARLOTTES VOICE
Lucy

LUCY climbs into bed and pulls the covers over her head

NIGHT INTERIOR ROOM WITH A VIEW - CHARLOTTES
CHARLOTTE taps on the wall

CHARLOTTE
Go to bed at once dear You
need all the rest you can get

CHARLOTTE begins her own night preparations She takes
off her rings and ranges them on the pincushion she
blows into her gloves And when she removes her dress
we see her money belt or money pouch an ungainly
utilitarian object from which she extracts a wad of
bills to count She unpins her hair when it is loose
she looks at her face in the mirror Her loosened hair
does not make her look younger on the contrary for it
is thinning and there are some grey strands in it which
she picks out in the mirror

But after a moment she stops doing that and instead
covers her face with her hands She sits there - very
still rigid and alone The rain goes on falling

TITLE CARD THE BETROTHAL

DAY EXTERIOR WINDY CORNER IN ITS SURREY

SETTING

Windy Corner - the Honeychurch house It is built on

a range of hills overlooking the Weald It stands not on
the summit of the ridge but a few hundred feet down the
southern slope There are ravines surrounding it filled
with ferns and pine trees

The situation of the house is exquisite - the house very
much less so This is no Stately Home or architecturally
interesting Manor that would be illustrated in Country
Life It is a rather ugly commodious late Victorian
house - spacious enough for the Honeychurch family and
servants but not imposing to connoisseurs of country
houses or English country life Yet it is so obviously
a family house built to satisfy comfort and personal
taste and not someone elses architectural pretensions
that it does not mar its beautiful setting but enhances
completes humanises it

Having viewed the house from a distance we draw near -
into the Garden which is very ordinary with trees
flower beds a terrace a rustic seat but is trans-
figured by the magnificent view stretching beyond it

Two figures are seated on the garden seat LUCY and
CECIL They are in the classic pose of knight preferring

his suit and maiden hiding her blushes - indeed they
might be posing for a painting entitled The Proposal

DAY

INTERIOR HONEYCHURCH DRAWING ROOM

From the garden we enter the drawing room of the house
here there are two other figures -

One of these MRS HONEYCHURCH is surreptitiously

peeping out between the drawn curtains at the COUPLE

in the garden

The other - FREDDY HONEYCHURCH - is
somewhat ostentatiously minding his own business

that

is he is studying a human bone which he has propped on
the piano and an accompanying text in a medical text-

book

MRS HONEYCHURCH
I think things are coming to a
head

FREDDY
I dont see you ought to go
peeping like that

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Peeping like what Cant I look
out of my own window (coming
over to glance at his book)
Still page 322

FREDDY snorts and turns over two pages

MRS HONEYCHURCH
You know Cecil actually asked
my permission I was so amused
Hes always gone in for unconven-
tionality and parents nowhere
and so forth But when it comes
to the point he cant get on
without me

FREDDY
Nor meHe asked me for my
permission also

MRS HONEYCHURCH
You

FREDDY nods

MRS HONEYCHURCH
How very odd - whatever did you
say

FREDDY
I said No - There Fly into
a stew I cant help it Its
the way he put it - didnt I
think it was a splendid thing
for Lucy if he married her and
wasnt I off my head with joy
So I said no I wasnt

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Ridiculous child You think
youre so holy and truthful but
really its only abominable
conceit -

FREDDY
Look out

For the curtains have parted and CECIL has entered

CECIL
(declaiming dramatically) I
promessi sposi

They fail to understand him They stare at him Now
that we see him close-up CECIL still looks like a knight
- not a romantic one but one stretched out on a tomb or
guarding the portals of a French cathedral He is tall
and refined thin Gothic fastidious sexless

CECIL
(translating for their benefit)
She has accepted me

MRS HONEYCHURCH
(after a short silence - over-
effusively) I am so glad Dear
Cecil what joy Welcome as one
of the family

CECIL
(shifting his eyes to the ceiling)
Thank you

FREDDY puts down his bone and proffers a hand stained
yellow by chemicals CECIL gingerly accepts it

But there is LUCY calling from the garden
MRS HONEYCHURCH and FREDDY run out to her - CECIL

watches them - amused perhaps rather touched by their
demonstrativeness He lights a cigarette

The MAID appears at the door to announce MR BEEBEE who
is in the room before she has finished

MR BEEBEE
Ah Mr Vyse Ive come for tea
Do you suppose I shall get it

CECIL
Food is the one thing one does
get here - dont sit in that
chair young Honeychurch has
left a bone in it

MR BEEBEE
Pfui Freddy really is terrible
- a most unpromising youth So
unlike his sister

CECIL L
(eager to talk about his fiancee)
You think his sister is promising

MR BEEBEE
(sitting down glad to expatiate)
«eel have a pet theory about Miss
Honeychurch

CECIL looks encouragingly at MR BEEBEE in expectation
of hearing the theory

MR BEEBEE
Does it seem reasonable to you
that she should play so wonder-
fully - play Beethoven with such
passion - and yet live so quietly
«eI suspect that the day will
come when music and life will
mingle and then she will be
wonderful in both

CECIL
(simply and sincerely) Well Mr
Beebee - I trust that day is at
hand she has just promised to
marry me

MR BEEBEE does not take this news in at once - and
when he does he expresses not the joy Cecil has
anticipated but looks disappointed put out

There is an awkward silence
CECIL

(dryly) Im sorry if Ive given
you a shock

Sl

MR BEEBEE
(pulling himself together) Im
sorry I must apologise I had
no idea you were intimate with
her Mr Vyse you ought to have
stopped me -

The others have spotted MR BEEBEE from the garden
They call to him asking What do you think of our
news

MR BEEBEE is glad to resolve the awkward moment - he
puts his arms around CECIL now smiling and leads him
out

DAY EXTERIOR HONEYCHURCH GARDEN

MR BEEBEE
(calling) Congratulations
Blessings Your vicars
benediction

In one hand he has FREDDYs bone which he throws to him
FREDDY catches it

MR BEEBEE
(as he goes out to them) I want
them all their lives to be
supremely good and supremely
happy as husband and wife as
father and mother And now I
want my tea

Everyone is now happy and smiling in the garden which is
like a green magic carpet hovering in the air above the
tremulous world of the Weald stretching beyond it

TITLE CARD LUCY AS A WORK OF ART

DAY INTERIOR MRS BUTTERWORTH DRAWING ROOM

A decorous tea party in a Summer Street drawing room
The social level is at the point where country merges
into suburban society

CECIL and LUCY are the centre piece of the occasion
which is in honour of their engagement

MRS HONEYCHURCH is of course present The other faces
are new to us These include SIR HARRY OTWAY the local
squire All beam approval on the YOUNG COUPLE

Some (partly) background conversation from SIR HARRY

SIR HARRY
There was some difference of
Opinion with the builder whose
idea of a Corinthian column was
not exactly classical

Interjections from other GUESTS - eg

1 You can hardly expect that sort
of person to have any conception
of the orders of architecture

2 It would be comic if it werent
so tragic (etc)

SIR HARRY
I hinted that a column should
be structural as well as
decorative and he informed me
that they had all been ordered
and were all in a different
style - one with dragons another
in the Ionian style - a third
introducing his wifes initials
Most unfortunate but what could
I do

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Sir Harry I think you should
just pull the whole thing down

SIR HARRY
That might be desirable but alas
is hardly practical

Simultaneously with the description of the columns a
clumsy young PARLOUR MAID is bringing in tea things -
The hostess MRS BUTTERWORTH keeps an anxious eye on
her

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Isnt that our Marys niece Maggie

MRS BUTTERWORTH
She has been helping out the past
two days - I hope she will turn
out more - (to MAID) No there
not here - (from the unsatis-
factory MAID she looks at CECIL
and whispers) I do congratulate
you Mrs Honeychurch a most
distinguished and agreeable young
man

But CECIL balancing plate and cup looks more distin-
guished than agreeable he is not enjoying the
occasion

SIR HARRY
What I fear most is that the
villa will attract the wrong
type of tenant It is too
large for the peasant class
and too small for anyone the
least like ourselves

CECIL
It might be a paradise for a
bank-clerk

SIR HARRY
(excitedly) Exactly That is
exactly what I fear Mr Vyse
It will attract the wrong
type of people The train
service has improved - a fatal
improvement to my mind

Other GUESTS murmur Quite and Rather unfortunate to
indicate their understanding of the problem

LUCY
Sir Harry - how would you like
spinsters

SIR HARRY
Most certainly - if they are
gent lewomen

LUCY

Oh indeed they are though at
present homeless I heard from
them last week - Miss Teresa
and Miss Catherine Alan - I met
them in Italy -

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Sir Harry beware of these gentle-
women they are certain to have
canaries they spit the seed out
through the bars of the cages and
then the mice come Beware of
women altogether and only let to
aman - provided of course he is
clean

LUCY
Mother you would be the first to
love the Miss Alans

MRS HONEYCHURCH
I dont know if I would love
anyone from that pension of
yours Wasnt there a lady
novelist too - and a free-
thinking father and his son

Just then the clumsy MAID upsets tea over LUCYs new
figured silk -

There is general consternation advice - offers of
help - Finally MRS HONEYCHURCH takes LUCY away to wipe
her dress -

CECIL looks after them rather wildly wishing he could
follow

MRS BUTTERWORTH
Let me see Mr Vyse - I forget
what is your profession

CECIL
I have no profession

Polite murmurs

CECIL
My attitude - quite an indefensible
one - is that so long as I am no
trouble to anyone I have a right
to do as I like It is I dare say
an example of my decadence

Some clearing of throats some more polite murmurs

SIR HARRY
(in an attempt to save the day)
You are very fortunate The
possession of leisure is a wonderful
opportunity

DAY INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM

MRS HONEYCHURCH on her knees is energetically swabbing
LUCYs dress

LUCY
Thats enough Mother Please
its all right (more high-
pitched) Leave it Mother

MRS HONEYCHURCH sits back on her heels and looks up at
LUCY as if asking what is the matter

LUCY
«Why did you say all that about
the Miss Alans Theyre charming
and kind and you will like them

MRS HONEYCHURCH
If you do Im sure I shall And
also of course the lady novelist
and the freethinking father -
very well dear Ill be serious
Write to the Miss Alans offer
them Sir Harrys villa -

LUCY
(interrupting her with what is
really on her mind) You do approve
of Cecil dont you Mother I
mean you like him

MRS HONEYCHURCH
(getting up) I told you dear
everyone that you like that you
love

LUCY still looks dubious its not as affirmative an
answer as shed hoped for

53 DAY INTERIOR MRS BUTTERWORTH DRAWING ROOM

CECIL is still holding forth to an increasingly
embarrassed company It is as if he is carried away
on wings of his own boredom and arrogance and cant
stop himself

CECIL
«eeLlm shockingly stupid over
local affairs It is very remiss
of me - but I only go into the
country to see my friends and
enjoy the scenery Italy and
London are the places where I
feel I truly belong -

To his relief to everyones relief - LUCY and MRS
HONEYCHURCH return -

CECIL
(jumping up) Mrs Honeychurch
what if Lucy and I walk home and
leave you

No one thinks this rude but everyone smiles with
pleasure at the impatience of a lover (Young people

young people)

MRS HONEYCHURCH
By all means leave me to my tea
and gossip and these delicious
scones

The older people seem as relieved to get rid of the
young as these are to leave

LUCY goes through the form of thanking and good-bying -
CECIL hardly has the patience

DAY EXTERIOR SUMMER STREET

Summer Street is a pretty little village arranged around

a meadow There are attractive cottages a few older
substantial houses from the eighteenth century and MR
BEEBEEs church which looks new and expensively simple
But the charming scene is marred by two ugly little
villas speculator built raw and out of place These
little houses have names on them - one is called Albert
and the other is Cissie The first is inhabited and
has lace curtains in its front windows and a well-tended
handkerchief-size lawn The second is empty ahd has
three “To-Let signs in front of it

As soon as they are outside -

CECIL
How perfectly appalling
disastrous

LUCY
Im so sorry

CECIL
Its so disgusting the way an
engagement is regarded as public
property

LUCY
One has to go through it I
suppose They wont notice us
so very much next time

But she has nothing more to offer on the subject They
walk along and come to the church the rectory and Sir
Harrys villa

MR BEEBEE is seen leaning over the gate of the rectory
smoking a peaceful pipe

CECIL
Theres your philosophising
parson

LUCY
Dont you like Mr Beebee either

He begins to protest -

But instead of listening to him LUCY approaches MR
BEEBEE

LUCY
Oh Mr Beebee Ive had such a
wonderful idea Im going to
write to our Miss Alans - Miss
Teresa and Miss Catherine - and
ask them to take Sir Harrys
villa

CECIL
(looking at villa) Is that it

MR BEEBEE
Rather horrible isnt it
But Im sure the Miss Alans have
read their Ruskin and will like it

CECIL
In my opinion Sir Harry deserves
a tenant as vulgar as his villa

LUCY
Oh Cecil Really hes very
nice

CECIL

I cant help it It would be
wrong not to loathe that man
Gentlewomen Ugh

LucY is in a hurry to draw CECIL away

LUCY
(to MR BEEBEE) I11 write to
them and if you would also send
a word -

MR BEEBEE hardly has time to agree before they are out
of earshot

LUCY
Goodness how cross you are

CECIL
It was that miserable tea-party
And all those dreadful people
And not being alone with you

They have now reached the woods surrounding the village
LUCY stops by a diverging footpath

LUCY
Which way shall we goPerhaps
the road is more sensible as we
are got up smart

Its true They are A pause

CECIL
»»eDo you know Lucy that since
we were engaged you have never
once been with me in the fields
or the wood

LUCY
Havent I The wood then

She leads the way into the wood
DAY EXTERIOR woop

LUCY loves being here so much that she forgets she is
not alone She makes her way sprightly as a wood numph
while CECIL has difficulty keeping up with her

When she has disappeared from his sight he calls to her
While waiting for her he sits on a tree-stump thereby
making it look like a drawing room chair

When she comes back for him -

CECIL
«I have a strange feeling that
you feel more at home with me in
a roomNever in the real country
like this

LUCY

Oh Cecil whatever do you mean
You talk as if I was a poetess
sort of person (looking at
him perched there she suddenly
bursts out laughing) How funny
Do you know that youre right
When I think of you its always
in a room

Laughing she walks on swift and sure He straggles
behind her not looking pleased She has come toa
little clearing among the pines There is a shallow
pool

She stands looking at it with pleasure It takes him
some time to catch up with her When he joins her -

LUCY
This is the Sacred Lake

CECIL
Its more a puddle than a lake

LUCY
Yes but after heavy rains it
fills up and becomes quite large
and beautifulFreddy loves to
bathe here Hes very fond of
the Sacred Lake

CEIL
And you

LUCY
(dreamily) I bathed here too
till I was found out Then
there was a row

He looks at her smiling dreamily by the pools edge
Forster wrote that she reminded him of some brilliant
flower that has no leaves of its own but blooms abruptly
out of a world of green

CECIL
«--Lucy

LUCY
Yes I suppose we ought to be
going

But instead he moves up closer to her

CECIL
Lucy I want to ask something of
you that I have never asked before

LUCY
(looking up at him frankly and
kindly) What Cecil (a pause)
Yes

CECIL
(visibly overcoming his embar-
rassment and looking around to
see if theyre observed) Up to
now I have never kissed you

LUCY
(stammering in embarrassment not
at the request but at his
clumsiness) No - you havent

CECIL
May I now

LUCY
Of course you may Cecil You
might before I cant run at
you you know

She gives a businesslike lift to her veil and dutifully
raises her face

After some hesitation he brings his own down to it - But
at the crucial moment his gold pincenez becomes dislodged
and is flattened between them

It is a very unsatisfactory moment for both of them
They walk away from the Sacred Lake in embarrassed
silence It is she who finally speaks

LUCY
You know Mother is right
Those people Charlotte and I
met at the pension -

CECIL
What people at what pension

LUCY
The Pension Bertolini in Florence
They were - all of them - rather
extraordinary

CECIL
(stiffly) I dont follow the
sequence of your thoughts

LUCY
They have no sequence They
never do

DAY EXTERIOR ROAD
Now they have reached the road again - and appear once

again a decorous Engaged Couple got up smart and walking
home from a tea party

DAY EXTERIOR TENNIS LAWN AT WINDY CORNER

A rowdy rumbustious game of Bumble-puppy is in progress
consisting of striking tennis balls high into the air so
that they fall over the net and bounce very hard It is
being played by LUCY and MINNIE MR BEEBEEs 13-year-old
niece with FREDDY acting alternately as referee and
co-player

Two stout middle-aged figures - MR BEEBEE and MRS
HONEYCHURCH - sit watching placidly Sometimes a ball
bounces among them even hits them MRS HONEYCHURCH
protests but in vain She is also keeping score and
commenting on the game absent-mindedly

MRS HONEYCHURCH
I hate that game - it turns
perfectly nice children into
savages Here Minnie
(tossing ball to her)

MR BEEBEE

Its good of you to let Minnie
come and be a savage at Windy
Corner life in the rectory is
too staid for my niece Im
trying to get Lucys attention
for this letter - from the Miss
Alans -

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Those tiresome Miss Alans I
hate their if-ing and but-ing -

MR BEEBEE
But they really are coming now
Miss Teresa enquired how often
the butcher called and my reply
must have impressed her favourably
- Lucy (waving letter) They
really are coming

MR BEEBEE and MRS HONEYCHURCH cry out in protest - but
the PLAYERS are getting all entangied now grabbing balls
and falling over each other
— While they are lying tangled up in the grass MR BEEBEE

who doesnt even know the name of
the other people

FREDDY
Yes I do Ive got it Emerson

LUCY
(quietly) What a weathercock Sir
Harry is I wish Id never bothered
over it at all

Then she turns and lies on her back and looks up at the
cloudless sky

MR BEEBEE notices LUCYs change of mood

She hears the voices of the others as from a long way
away

MRS HONEYCHURCH
EmersonI trust they are the
right sort of person Yes Freddy
there is a right sort and a wrong

sort and its affectation to pretend
there isnt

FREDDY
Well these must be the right sort
because theyre friends of Cecils

LUCY
(sitting up on the grass with a
jolt) Cecil
Appealing

She goes

FREDDY
(with elaborate irony) So you
and the other county families will
be able to call in perfect safety

LUCY
Cecil

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Lucy dont screech Its a new
bad habit youre getting into

Lucy
(getting up from the grass)
Emersons a common enough name

MRS BEEBEE
(trying to help her regain her
composure) Yes we had some
Emersons at Florence do you
remember Oh Mrs Honeychurch
the oddest people these Emersons
The queerest people - for our part
we liked them didnt we -

to LUCY who is on her way to the house

FREDDY
(catching hold of LUCYs ankles)
SO really dee-sire-rebel Ahem
Honeychurch I have just telegraphed
to them

LUCY
(gravely) Dont be silly Freddy
You always overdo it when you play

slowly and alone toward the house She might

still hear MR BEEBEES VOICE telling MRS HONEYCHURCH
about the Emersons describing the roomful of violets

CECIL is leaning out of the smoking-room window Hes
in great spirits

But LUCY

CECIL
Dont move Stay right there
Yes a LeonardoDid you know
you were a Leonardo Smiling at
things beyond our ken

refuses to be a Leonardo and goes on walking

toward him

LUCY
— Cecil whats this about Sir
Harrys tenants

CECIL
(very pleased with himself) Yes

‘ I even I have found him tenants
for his Cissie Villa Dont be
angry Youll forgive me when you
hear it all Ive won a great
victory for the Comic Muse Dont
be angry

She is now by the window He takes her hands Again -
spuriously - they look like traditional lovers in
traditional romantic pose

LUCY
Oh Cecil - after all that trouble
I took over the Miss Alans Well
of course Id rather have nice
friends of yours so I suppose I
must forgive you

CECIL
(laughing heartily) Friends of
mine Lucy the whole joke is to

come Theyre absolute strangers
whom I happened to meet in the
National Gallery

LUCY
(nervously) What an odd place to
meet people

CECIL
In the Umbrian Room Absolute
strangers They were admiring
Luca Signorelli -- of course quite
stupidly However we got talking
They amused me not a little They
had been to Italy - a father an a
son - the oddest couple -

Horror and consternation are growing in LUCY She drops
his hands and steps back from him as he proceeds
hilariously

We see a Silent Flashback contained within a circular
frame at the side of the master scene

FLASHBACK DAY NATIONAL GALLERY LONDON

CECIL GEORGE EMERSON and MR EMERSON are seated
together on a round velvet seat in one of the Italian
rooms at the National Gallery

They are having a conversation which we do not hear
but which CECIL in Voice Over is describing

CECIL
«eeIn the course of conversation
they said they wanted a country
cottage and did I know of one -
a simple burrow they could call
their own where they could smell
the earth -

We see MR EMERSON beseeching CECIL with his hands joined
as in prayer

CECIL
- As a matter of fact I said I
do Not exactly a cottage more
a villa with some rather original
architectural features It is in
Surrey a place called Summer
Street

In the Flashback MR EMERSON shouts Summer Street I
have dreamed of Summer Street

CECIL
- I thought What a chance of
scoring off Sir Harry I took
their address - it was great sport

We see this Flashback ends

LUCY goes into the house abruptly but not into the
smoking room

66 DAY INTERIOR PASSAGE AND STAIRS

CECIL has come to the smoking room door and sees LUCY
ascend the stairs

CECIL
»eIt will teach that snob Sir
Harry a lessonNo Lucy the
classes ought to mix There ought
to be intermarriage - all sorts of
things I believe in democracy

LUCY
(snapping)
No you dontYou dont know
what the word means

CECIL is amazed

LUCY
It isnt fair Cecil Ive
probably met them before -

CECIL
Perfectly fair if it punishes
a snob -

LUCY
(cutting his attempt to justify
himself short) Cecil I blame you
- I blame you very much indeed
You had no business to undo my
work about the Miss Alans and
make me look ridiculous You
call it scoring off Sir Harry
but do you realize that its all
at my expense I consider it
most disloyal of you

She leaves him

CECIL
(looking after her with raised
eyebrows) Temper Lucy Temper

please

But LUCY goes up the stairs - into her bedroom - closes
the door

67 DAY EXTERIOR CISSIE VILLA NOW THE EMERSONS

A beautiful sunny day MR BEEBEE with FREDDY behind
him unlatches the gate of Cissie Villa and goes up to
the open front door Behind the two men Summer Street
can be seen and some automobiles passing with people in
dusters out for a drive on a glorious day

MR BEEBEE
Hallo

GEORGE is carrying a large framed photograph of Rafaels
School of Athens up the stairs

GEORGE
Hallo

MR BEEBEE
Ive brought someone to see you

GEORGES VOICE
Ill be down in a minute

The front hall is blocked by a wardrobe and other
belongings The sitting room is full of books in boxes
and in piles stacked up

FREDDY
(whispering) Are these people
great readers

MR BEEBEE
I fancy they know how to read -
a rare accomplishment What
have they got Byron Exactly
A Shropshire Lad Never heard
of it The Way of All Flesh
Never heard of it Hullo Dear
George reads German Um - um -
Schopenhauer Nietzsche and so
we go on

Someone has painted on the wardrobe in an amateur hand
Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes
FREDDY points this out to MR BEEBEE

MR BEEBEE
I like that Im certain thats
the old mans doing What on
earth are those people doing
upstairs Emerson - we think
well come another time

GEORGE now comes clattering down the stairs He pushes
them silently and unceremoniously into the sitting room

MR BEEBEE
Let me introduce Mr Honeychurch
a neighbor

FREDDY
(to GEORGE) How dye do Come
and have a bathe

GEORGE
(impassive as usual) Oh all right

MR BEEBEE
(much amused) Thats the best
conversational opening Ive
ever heard How dye do
Come and have a bathe

MR EMERSON comes down the stairs

MR BEEBEE
Let me introduce Mr Honeychurch
whose sister you will remember at
Florence

MR EMERSON

How do you do Very glad to see
you Very glad to hear that
your sister is going to marry

I am sure she will be happy We
know Mr Vyse too Hes been
most kind - yes go and bathe
George The change will do you
good Then come back for tea
(calling out after them) Bring
back some milk cakes honey

FREDDY
Do you really want this bathe

GEORGE
Yes - Ive said yes already

MR BEEBEE leads them out of the house MR EMERSON
dispenses smiles and waves shouts Yours is glorious
country Honeychurch

DAY EXTERIOR PINE WOODS

The two young MEN are silent but MR BEEBEE chatters
away

MR BEEBEE
When I was a young man I always
meant to write a History of
Coincidence

No response

MR BEEBEE
Though as a matter of fact
coincidences are much rarer
than we suppose

Nothing from either

MR BEEBEE
For example it isnt pure
coincidentality that youre
here now when one comes to
reflect

More silent walking MR BEEBEE is about to give up when
GEORGE finally speaks

GEORGE
I have reflected Its Fate
Everything is Fate

MR BEEBEE
You have not reflected at all
Emerson Let me give youa
useful tip attribute nothing
to Fate Now Ill cross-examine
you Where did you first meet
Mr Vyse who is going to marry
Miss Honeychurch

GEORGE
National Gallery

MR BEEBEE
Looking at Italian art There
you are and yet you talk of
coincidence and Fate You
naturally seek out things
Italian and so do we and our
friends This narrows the
field immeasurably

GEORGE
Its Fate that I am here but
call it Italy if it makes you
happy

FREDDY
Here we are

MR BEEBEE
(mopping his brow) Oh good

69 DAY EXTERIOR THE SACRED LAKE - A SMALL POND
IN A WOODS
They make their way down a slippery bank of pine needles
to the little pond that lies in a sort of lap of green
Because of the rains the water has flooded the
surrounding grass making it look like an emerald path

They go up to the edge of the pond and look at it a
moment

FREDDY
(starting to strip) I wish it
was bigger

MR BEEBEE
Its distinctly successful as
ponds go No apologies are
necessary for the pond

GEORGE sits down where the bank is dry and starts to
“-unlace his boots

MR BEEBEE continues his chatter as the others strip

MR BEEBEE
Whats the name of this aromatic
plant
No answer
MR BEEBEE

I love willow-herb in seed -
these abrupt changes of vege-
tation water plants heather
bracken hurts pines - very
charming

FREDDY prances in

FREDDY
Mr Beebee arent you bathing

GEORGE is stripping without much enthusiasm revealing a
fine compact physique

When he is naked he stands on the bank of the pool in a
Michelangelesque pose weight on one foot hand care-
lessly on hip chin down

GEORGE
Is it worth it

FREDDY
(puffing up and down) Waters
wonderful Waters simply ripping
Do hurry up Emerson Come along
Mr Beebee

MR BEEBEE laughingly disclaiming any intention of
joining them nevertheless begins to divest himself
of his clerical clothes

As GEORGE stands hesitating the bank breaks away and -
much to FREDDYs delight - he is plunged in

GEORGE
(reappearing sputtering at the
sun) Waters not bad

FREDDY
Waters wonderful Mr Beebee
do

MR BEEBEE looks around cautiously as if expecting
parishioners to appear from behind the bushes

MR BEEBEE
I may as well wash too why not

The remainder of his clothes are flung off very fast
There are now three neat little piles of clothes
MR BEEBEE approaches the pool FREDDY pulls him in

All three rotate in the pool breast-high like the nymphs
in Goetterdaemmerung

FREDDY
Its like swimming in a salad
Ugh Ive swallowed a frog

MR BEEBEE
(laughing at him) Hee-hee
Freddys swallowed a pollywog

FREDDY splashes him MR BEEBEE playfully splashes him
back

After splashing each other they turn and splash GEORGE -
timidly as if unsure of his reaction

After a moments delay GEORGEs reaction is stupendous

He smiles flings himself at them splashes them ducks
them kicks them muddies them and drives them out of
the pond

FREDDY
Race you round it

They race around the pond in the sunshine GEORGE takes
a shortcut and goes through the pond Then MR BEEBEE
consents to race They rush into the water to cool off
then out to play football

FREDDY snatches up GEORGEs bundle and places it beside
an imaginary goalpost

FREDDY
Atry A try

GEORGE
(scattering FREDDYs bundle
with a kick) Soccer rules

FREDDY
Goal

GEORGE
Goal

FREDDY
Pass

MR BEEBEE

Take care my watch
Clothes are flying in all directions

MR BEEBEE
(crying in unheeded protest)
Take care my hat No thats
enough Freddy Dress now
No I say

The two young MEN are deliriously running around FREDDY
with a clerical waistcoat under his arm GEORGE with a
wide-awake hat on his dripping hair

MR BEEBEE
Thatll do Hil Steady on I
see people coming you fellows

He is still disregarded They continue to yell and
scrimmage

MR BEEBEE
Hi Ladies

His warning is too late - the LADIES are upon them before
they can hide

It is MRS HONEYCHURCH and LUCY escorted by CECIL
FREDDY dropping the waistcoat at their feet dives for
shelter into some bracken

MR BEEBEE dives back into the pond

GEORGE after whooping into their faces disappears
down a path still clad only in MR BEEBEEs hat

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Gracious alive Who ever were
those unfortunate people Oh
dears look away And poor Mr
Beebee too

CECIL
Come this way immediately

LUCY has swiftly placed her parasol between herself and
the immodest sight

CECIL
(masterfully) This way Mrs
Honeychurch this way

But that way FREDDY is hidden and as they approach his
head and naked shoulders emerge

FREDDY
Look out Youre treading on
me

MRS HONEYCHURCH
So its you dear Why not have
a comfortable bath at home with
hot and cold laid on -

FREDDY
Look here Mother -

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Youre in no position to argue
Freddy Come Lucy

As they turn to go -

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Oh look no dont look - oh
poor Mr Beebee

For they have caught MR BEEBEE in the act of crawling
out of the pond He hastily crawls back again and swims
there unhappily surrounded by floating garments of an
intimate nature

GEORGE now clad in a pair of ill-fitting trousers
steps boldly in front of them from behind a bush

FREDDY
Emerson you beast youve got my
bags on

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Hush dears Be sure you dry
yourselves thoroughly first
All these colds -

LUCY
(simultaneously) Oh Mother
do come away For goodness
sake do come

GEORGE
Hallo

This is shouted with such bold self-confidence that they
are stopped in their tracks

GEORGE
Hallo Miss Honeychurch Hallo

MRS HONEYCHURCH
(urgently whispering) Bow Lucy
better bow Who ever is it I
shall bow

She does so
LUCY - immaculately dressed in white holding a parasol -

also bows she is stiff tight-lipped vacant-eyed So
is CECIL

‘But GEORGE hardly dressed at all barefoot barechested

is as utterly at ease as if he owned the wood the lake
the sky and everything else the eye can see He is
radiant

TITLE CARD HOW MISS BARTLETTS BOILER WAS SO TIRESOME
DAY INTERIOR DRAWING ROOM

FREDDY is tinkling at the piano playing Chopsticks
with two fingers

CECIL looks pained at the noise he is making

LUCY hardly hears it but aware of CECILs displeasure
comes out with an occasional Must you Freddy or Do
stop it

MRS HONEYCHURCH reading a letter shakes her head over
it and gives an occasional Poor Charlotte Oh poor
poor Charlotte

LUCY
(To CECIL) This is the standard
reaction to any letter from our
cousin Charlotte -
LUCY AND FREDDY
(in unison) Poor poor Charlotte

MRS HONEYCHURCH
How unkind you areBut it really
is serious her boiler is to be
had out and her bath cistern
cleaned and all kinds of terrible
to-doingI think it would be
very nice if we asked her to stay
- and give her a nice holiday
while the plumbers at Tunbridge
Wells finish

CECIL lays his hands over his eyes

A pause -
piano

LUCY
Mother no Were squeezed to
death as it is with Freddys
friend coming and Minnie Beebee -

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Minnie can sleep with you

LUCY
I wont have her

CECIL
Most decidedly you wont

LUCY
Freddy must you

with only FREDDY playing chopsticks on the

MRS HONEYCHURCH
(folding away letter) The truth
is dear you dont like Charlotte

LUCY
She gets on my nerves and the
one time Cecil met her she drove
him quite frantic So please
Mother dont worry us this last
summer but spoil us by not
asking her to come

CECIL
Hear hear We vote no Miss
Bartlett

MRS HONEYCHURCH
This isnt very kind of you two
You have each other and poor
Charlotte has only the water
turned off and plumbers

CECIL
Again Poor Charlotte

FREDDY suddenly launches into a comic song

FREDDY
Strike the concertinas
melancholy string

Blow the spirit-stirring harp
like anything”

It isnt very comic but it overrides the dispute MRS
HONEYCHURCH enjoys it and so would LUCY - If it werent
for CECIL who gets up and ostentatiously strolls out

FREDDY
Let the pianos martial blast
Rouse the echoes of the past

CECIL can be seen standing aesthetically under a tree
in the garden looking like one of those Elizabethan
miniatures of a very refined youth enjoying a highly
stylised Nature

FREDDY
“They played then a sonata - let
me see

Medulla oblongata - key of G

LUCY joins CECIL outside - So that when FREDDY looks
round at his audience only MRS HONEYCHURCH is left

FREDDY
Whats the matter Isnt it
good

MRS HONEYCHURCH
(abstracted) Its lovely dear

FREDDY
Then they began to sing
That extremely lovely thing

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Since Cecil came back from London
nothing and no one appears to
please him Whenever I speak he
winces - I see him Lucy its
useless to contradict me No
doubt I am neither artistic nor
literary nor intellectual but I
cannot help the drawing room
furniture

LUCY
(much embarrassed) Cecil
doesnt mean to be uncivil - he
once explained - it is ugly
things that upset him - he is
not uncivil to people

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Is it a thing or a person when
Freddy sings

Lucy
(faltering) You cant expect a
really musical person to enjoy
comic songs as we do

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Why must he sneer and spoil

LUCY stops still by the landing window She is
depressed FREDDY comes bounding up the stairs
FREDDY

the Emersons up for tennis
LUCY
Oh I wouldnt do that Freddy
- I really wouldnt -
FREDDY
(clutching her elbows and dancing
up and down the passage with her)
Theyre topping people - theyre
ripping - the Emersons are
spiffing -
LUCY is very irritated with him - so is CECIL coming up
to change - so is the MAID carrying up hot water cans
MRS HONEYCHURCH
(appearing in her doorway) What
a noise youre making
She sees the expression on LUCYs face
MRS HONEYCHURCH
Let Lucy go Freddy
FREDDY also now looks into LUCYs face - and lets her
go at once There is a great unspoken understanding
between these three Honeychurches
MRS HONEYCHURCH stands aside inviting LUCY into her
bedroom again

BRAVELY
74 DAY EXTERIOR LANDSCAPE PASSING SEEN THROUGH

TRAIN WINDOW

The country around Summer Street looking lush and
beautiful

But its not even noticed by CHARLOTTE in the second-
class carriage She is in an agony of suspense She
looks at her ticket stub at a timetable in her bag at
the other PASSENGERS whom she would like to ask for
advice - and begins to raising her gloved hand but
then falters they arent the right sort to ask being
two TRAVELLING MEN and she a lone femaleShe with-
draws her hand rummages again with the timetable etc
stands up opens the window but just then the train
enters a tunnel and smoke and cinders blow into the
carriage The TRAVELLING MEN cough CHARLOTTE cant

the wrong station Trust

Charlotte
76 DAY EXTERIOR RAILWAY STATION

CHARLOTTE is peering around anxiously and making anxious
enquiries A PORTER explains to her that this is not the
South-Eastern station at Dorking but the London and
Brighton station -

CHARLOTTE
(very flustered) I thought it was
DorkingHow very vexingI
suppose I had better take a cab -
and you had better take my -

In her flurried state she doesnt see where she is

going - And bumps into a man wheeling a bicycle out

of the station - Her apologies give way to astonish-
ment when she discovers this man to be GEORGE

CHARLOTTE
Mr Emerson

He greets her in his own inimitably impassive way

CHARLOTTE
«Were you on the train I had
no idea -

GEORGE
My father lives here I come
weekends

Considering this both sufficient explanation and conver
sation he gets on his bicycle and rides off CHARLOTTE
gets into the cab pays the PORTER is driven off

77 DAY EXTERIOR IN A CARRIAGE
CHARLOTTE is now deeply disturbed She is too much
in her thoughts to notice the beautiful scenery through

which she is being driven What makes it worse for her
is that every time her carriage rounds a corner she sees -

GEORGE on his bicycle

DAY EXTERIOR SUMMER STREET

Unlike Charlotte GEORGE is enjoying the scenery very
much He has his hands in his pockets like a trick
cyclist and is whistling happily

Passing an overhanging branch he rises in the saddle
to pluck at it

MRS HONEYCHURCH FREDDY MR FFLOYD (Freddys friend)
CECIL and MINNIE BEEBEE are at tea

up the party -

FREDDY has returned

CHARLOTTE
How much was it Freddy I

FREDDY
If youd really rather - five
shillings and I gave a bob to

Another contretemps CHARLOTTE has no change only a
sovereign FREDDY and MR FFLOYD dig out half-crowns

CHARLOTTE
--We all have our little foibles
and mine is the prompt settling of
accountsBut who am I to give
the sovereign to

FREDDY and MR FFLOYD offer to toss for the sovereign

CHARLOTTE
Please - please - I know Ima
sad spoil-sport but it would
make me wretched I should
practically be robbing the one
who lost

MRS HONEYCHURCH turns her eyes up to heaven

CECIL
(amusing himseif) Freddy owes me
15 shillings So it will work
out all right if you give the
pound to me

CHARLOTTE
(bewildered but handing it over)
Most kind of you Mr Vyse

MINNIE
(protesting) Why is Mr Vyse
taking the quid

MR FFLOYD and FREDDY try to stifle her with cake

MINNIE
What about Mr Ffloyds ten
shillings

She shrieks as FREDDY pokes her

LUCY
(getting up with decision) Cecil
give me that sovereign No give
it to me Ill get Mary to change
it and well start from the
beginning

She starts off across the lawn

CHARLOTTE
(following her wailing) Lucy -
Lucy - what a nuisance I am

As soon as they are out of earshot -

CHARLOTTE
(quite briskly) Have you told him
about him yet

LUCY
No I havent

She goes into the house CHARLOTTE following
DAY INTERIOR PASSAGE

CHARLOTTE goes into the drawing room LUCY calls down
the basement stairs to the MAID asking for change -
MAID comes up with it

LUCY lingers over this not wanting to join CHARLOTTE
till she has sufficiently collected herself and has
made up her mind what to say When she has done so
she goes into the drawing room

DAY INTERIOR DRAWING ROOM

CHARLOTTE is gazing at an Italian picture hung up there
(it is the same one with which we saw GEORGE struggling
on the stair Rafaels “School of Athens)

LUCY
No I havent told Cecil or
anyone I promised you I
shouldnt Here is your money
- all shillings except two
half-crowns Would you count
it You can settle your debt
nicely now

CHARLOTTE
(murmuring looking at Italian
picture) How dreadful - how more
than dreadful if Mr Vyse should
come to hear of it from some
other source

LUCY
There is no other source

CHARLOTTE
He would have told his father

LUCY
He would not He would not
have told anyone

CHARLOTTE
How do you know

LUCY
Because I know Shall we go
out Theyll smash all the
china if we dont

Through the windows she can see FREDDY and MR FFLOYD
scalping MINNIE with tea spoons Minnies screams can
also be heard

CHARLOTTE
Dear one moment - we may not
have this chance for a chat
again Have you spoken to him
yet

LUCY
-t have seen him

CHARLOTTE
What happened

LUCY
(taking up a position too firm
and common-sensical to be con-
vincing) You simply must stop
thinking that he admires me or
any nonsense of that sort He
doesnt not one straw

Linking her arm into CHARLOTTEs she draws her outside
As they go -

LUCY
Suppose we dont talk about this
silly Italian business any more
We want you to have a nice restful
visit at Windy Corner with no

worriting
84 DAY EXTERIOR GARDEN

LUCY leaves CHARLOTTE and runs to the rescue of MINNIE
CHARLOTTE follows soberly her dark-clad figure
expressing foreboding

85 DAY EXTERIOR GARDEN OF WINDY CORNER

Sunday morning Another perfect day The scene begins
with a travelling shot towards a book which lies on
the gravel path It has a red cover and from its size
might be a novel

As the camera is moving towards this book which lies
open and face down as if forgotten we hear female
voices coming from the house making church-going
preparations

VOICES
The men say they wont go

Well I dont blame them
Minnie says need she go
Tell her no nonsense
Mary Hook me behind

Dearest Lucia may I trespass
upon you for a pin

The camera has moved to a close-up of the book Its

title is Under a Loggia

LUCY wearing a vivid pink dress comes out of the
drawing room window and looks at the view She does
not look happy In fact she is frowning looking as
if she is holding back tears

VOICE OF MRS HONEYCHURCH
Lucy Lucy Whats that book

LUCY looks up at her mother standing in an upstairs
window

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Whos been taking a book out of
the shelf and leaving it to spoil

LUCY
Its only a library book that
Cecils been reading

MRS HONEYCHURCH
But pick it up and dont stand
idling there like a flamingo
Have you a sixpence for Minnie
and a shilling for yourself

86 DAY EXTERIOR FRONT STEPS OF WINDY CORNER

The LADIES pop out one at a time all dressed up for
church MRS HONEYCHURCH has worked herself into a Sunday
fluster She counts out money

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Its a special collection - I
forget what for - I do beg no
vulgar clinking in the plate
with halfpennies See that
Minnie has a nice bright sixpence
Where is the child Here comes
the horse - (etc)

The carriage pulls up and LUCY and MRS HONEYCHURCH go
towards it

CHARLOTTE appears smartly dressed

CHARLOTTE
Dear Marian Im so very sorry -
but I have no small change -
Could you -

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Yes easily Jump in Gracious
me how smart you look What a
lovely frock

MINNIE runs down the steps and climbs in and the carriage
pulls away with spirit

CECIL appears at the door and calls out Goodbye Be
good The tone is sneering LUCY bites her lip

87 DAY EXTERIOR TENNIS LAWN - WINDY CORNER

FREDDY and GEORGE are playing against LUCY and MR FFLOYD
——

The game is very active LUCY who has changed her dress
is entirely different from the morning She is having
fun she seems free relaxed unimpeded carefree in a
mood we have not seen before

GEORGE is very determined to win - He makes LUCY run up
and down - she does her best but keeps missing balls

This delights him no end and crowing with triumph he
shouts out the score

If there is an impediment to the general fun it is
CECIL who is odd man out He makes a nuisance of
himself and tries to draw attention away from the others
This he does by walking up and down LUCYs side of the
court reading aloud from the forgotten red book The
book is so bad he is obliged to read it to the others
(I say listen to this Lucy - three split infinitives
etc)

GEORGE wins the set But he has knocked so many balls
into the bushes that FREDDY and MR FFLOYD have to dive
in search of them

CECIL
Theres a murder scene too -
do listen

LUCY
What fun Cecil Read away

She seats herself near him GEORGE jumps over the net
CECIL
(getting ready to read) The
scene is laid in Florence -

GEORGE sits down at LUCYs feet

CECIL
Sunset - the sunset of Italy
GEORGE
(Looking up at LUCY) Do you mind
losing
LUCY

(merrily) Yes Of course I do
I dont see youre such a splendid
player though The light was

behind you and it was in my eyes

GEORGE
I never said I was

CECIL
(reading louder not liking any
interruption) Under Orcagnas
Loggia - the Loggia deLanzi as
we sometimes call it now -

LUCY
Whats the title

CECIL
(reading from spine) Under the
Loggia by Eleanor Lavish

LUCY
(bursting into laughter) Eleanor
Lavish Oh my goodness Mr
Emerson you remember Miss Lavish

GEORGE
Of course I do

LUCY
No wonder the novels bad But
I suppose one ought to read it as
ones met her

His dark head is very near her lap She stares down at
it We feel her impulse could be to suddenly stroke it

CECIL
Theres an absurd account of a
view which I will spare you -

LUCY
No do read itHow do you like
our view Mr Emerson

GEORGE
My father says theres only one
perfect view -

He looks up into her face - She waits interested

GEORGE
- the view of the sky straight
over our heads and that all
these views on earth are bungled
copies of it

CECIL
(shutting the book with a snap)
I expect your father has been
reading Dante

He gets up ready to stalk off

LUCY
MN »-eCecil do read the description
of the view

CECIL
Not while Mr Emerson is here
to entertain us

LUCY
No - read away Nothings funnier
than to hear silly things read out
loud If Mr Emerson thinks were
frivolous he can go help look for
tennis balls

CECIL is pleased with this reply and sits down again

mollified

LUCY

Mr Emerson go and find tennis

balls
GEORGE

Must I
Lucy

Ne No of course not

CECIL

(yawning handing the book to
LUCY) Its in Chapter 2 - just
find me Chapter 2

LUCY leafs through the book to find the chapter She
reads something which freezes her Her eyes are
stretched wide

CECIL
Here give it to me

LUCY
(holding the book away from him)
Oh its too silly - who would
want to read such rubbish -

CECIL reaches over and takes the book from her and reads

CECIL
Afar off the towers of Florence
while the bank on which she sat
was carpeted with violets All
unobserved he stole up behind
her - Isnt it immortal - there
came from his lips no wordy
protestations such as formal
lovers use

He looks up from the book to have her share his smile -
Afraid of what he might see in her eyes she turns them
from him -

And looks straight into GEORGEs unblinkingly raised
to hers -

CECIL
No eloquence was his nor did
he suffer from the lack of it
He simply enfolded her in his
manly arms - This isnt the
passage theres another much
funnier further on (searching
for it)

Lucy
(in a steady voice) Should we
go in to tea
She rises and leads the way
CECIL
By all means tea rather than
Eleanor Lavish
He follows her
GEORGE follows them both They enter the shrubbery

CECIL
Oh I forgot the book -

LUCY
Never mind -

CECIL
Its your mothers library book
and she will fuss
He goes back to get it
GEORGE blunders against her in the narrow path

LUCY
No -

But he kisses her (on the lips)
And she stands still for him

CECILS VOICE can be heard approaching - I must read
you the bit about the murder - a crime passionel -

LUCY walks on

CECIL rejoins them
GEORGE lets them walk ahead

CECIL
(his voice receding) What is
it about Italy that makes lady
novelists reach such summits
of absurdity

GEORGE trailing behind plucks a flower rather roughly
but he holds and smells it tenderly

TITLE CARD LYING TO GEORGE
DAY INTERIOR PASSAGE AND STAIRS

As CECIL and LUCY enter the house - CHARLOTTE is coming
down the stairs

LUCY
Charlotte -

CHARLOTTE sees that something has happened

LUCY
(to CECIL) Go and start tea
Ill be with you in a moment

She watches CECIL go into the drawing room and help
himself from the tea table Then she goes into the
Opposite room

DAY INTERIOR SMOKING ROOM

CHARLOTTE immediately follows looking apprehensive As
soon as the door is shut -

LUCY
Do you know anything about Miss
Lavishs novel

CHARLOTTE looks bewildered and then a little shifty

LUCY
There is a scene in it The
hero and heroine make love Do
you know about that

CHARLOTTE
Dear -

LUCY
Do you know about it please
They are on a hillside and
Florence is in the distance

CHARLOTTE opens and then closes her mouth

LUCY
There are violets I cannot
believe it is a coincidence
Charlotte Charlotte how could
you have told her

CHARLOTTE
Oh Lucy dearest girl - she
hasnt put that in her book

LUCY nods CHARLOTTE sinks on to a chair

CHARLOTTE
Then never - never - never more
shall Eleanor Lavish be friend
of mine

LUCY
So you did tell

CHARLOTTE hides her face shaking her head making no
attempt to defend herself

LUCY
Cecil read it to me - and - that
man took the opportunity to
insult me again behind Cecils
back

CHARLOTTE moans

LUCY
Why did you tell her What
Made you

But now LUCY sees GEORGE approaching ambling slowly
toward the house across the lawn

As she watches him - CHARLOTTE moaning - the hard
expression goes from LUCYs face and she looks like

a girl watching her lover from the window And GEORGE
- handsome and manly - does look like a lover But then
her expression hardens again

Lucy
I see now why you wanted me to
tell Cecil and what you meant
by some other source You
knew that you had told Miss
Lavish and that she was not
reliable

CHARLOTTE wincing joins LUCY by the window and takes
her hand

CHARLOTTE
Even if you forgive me I shall
never forgive myself not to my
dying day

LUCY
(watching GEORGE not listening
to CHARLOTTE) Go and cail him

CHARLOTTE
Call Mr Vyse

LUCY
No - no The other one

CHARLOTTE tries to protest but LUCY turning from the
window says in a cold voice

LUCY
This time I11 deal with him
myself

CHARLOTTE dare not disobey her She goes out LUCY
seats herself very straight-backed in a very straight
chair

She clenches her hands she can be seen steeling her-
self CHARLOTTE returns with GEORGE still holding his
tennis racket

LUCY
Charlotte please stay

CHARLOTTE looking frightened shuts the door and stands
against it as if barring their exit We see them from
CHARLOTTE POV

LUCY
(rising from her seat) Mr
Emerson go out of this house
and never come into it again as
long as I live hereI hate a
row (pointing to the door)
Go please

GEORGE
But I cant -

LUCY
Go please I do not want to
call in Mr Vyse

GEORGE
You dont mean you are going to
Marry that man

LUCY
(taken by surprise then
recovering she hasnt expected
him to take that line) You are
merely ridiculous

While they continue talking CHARLOTTE can see CECIL
appearing on the terrace with his tea cup

CECIL carefully puts down the cup seats himself dusts
his knees picks up his cup stirs it sips it precise
and prissy looking

GEORGE
»-eOh I would have held back
i£ your Cecil had been a different
person But hes the sort who
cant know anyone intimately -
least of all a woman He doesnt
know what a woman is He wants
you for a possession - he wants
to see you as a painting - or an
ivory box - something exquisite
to own and display He doesnt
want you to be real and think and
live

CHARLOTTE turns away from the sight of CECIL - CHARLOTTE
POV - LUCY and GEORGE standing close together
Dissolve -

DAY EXTERIOR TUSCAN LANDSCAPE

CHARLOTTE sees again - LUCY and GEORGE kissing among
the violets - but enhanced more than what took place
more romantic more passionate Dissolve -

DAY INTERIOR SMOKING ROOM

LUCY and GEORGE standing close together GEORGE is as
usual unable to express himself and stammers with strong
feeling afraid of not making himself clear he tends to
repeat the same idea several times over in his own
simple straightforward language

GEORGE
But I love you - in a better way
than he does Yes - really ina
better way I want you to have
your own thoughts even when I hold
you in my arms

And for a moment it looks as if he is going to take her
in his arms - But this time he controls himself and turns

instead to CHARLOTTE

GEORGE
You wouldnt stop us this second
time if you understood

And in fact CHARLOTTE does not stop them - she lowers
her eyes away from GEORGEs penetrating gaze and says
nothing So that he feels entitled to appeal again
directly to LUCY

GEORGE
Its our last chance

He gazes at her with great intensity Like CHARLOTTE
she cannot meet this gaze half turns from him there is

something hesitant in her attitude which makes him press
on

GEORGE
You mustnt say no - you mustnt
ever say no to whats right and
good Dont you understand how
lucky people are when theyve
found whats right for them
Its ablessing dont you see

She has remained in her hesitant attitude but now she
faces him - faces him falsely with a hard laugh that
isnt hers at all

LUCY
And the fact that I love Cecil
and shall be his wife shortly
I suppose thats a detail of no
importance

And he does brush it aside as though it were

GEORGE
This tremendous thing has
happened and what it means - let
me explain - it means nothing
must hinder us not ever again
Never again Thats what it means
You have to understand that

LUCY
I have no idea what youre talking
about

GEORGE

(half turning to CHARLOTTE with
great emphasis almost shouting)
Everyone has to understand

CHARLOTTE starts forward as though to say something but
LUCY silences her with a gesture

LUCY
And you must leave It was
wrong of me - very wrong - to
stand here listening to you

She turns away from him in dismissal and as she does
so he catches her hand in desperation and she doesnt
snatch it away at once but leaves it lingering in his
long enough for him to say -

GEORGE
But you havent been listening
If you had you would know

Now she does snatch it away

LUCY
How dare you You will leave
at once Now - No not another
word - no no -

And much shaken in spite of herself she puts her hands
over her ears -

Lucy
I will not listen to one more
word

CHARLOTTE
Lucy -

LUCY

(flashing out at CHARLOTTE)
Havent you done enough Dont
interfere again

GEORGE tries to meet LUCYs eyes again - but she is
resolutely turned away from him He stands there for
a moment defeated then goes toward the door where
CHARLOTTE is still standing CHARLOTTE doesnt move
making no secret of the fact that she doesnt want
him to leave

GEORGE
Its useless Let me go Miss
Bartlett

Still CHARLOTTE does not move

LUCY
Let Mr Emerson go Charlotte

CHARLOTTE moves aside reluctantly

It is CHARLOTTE who goes to the window to watch GEORGE
stride away

LUCY to hide her feelings has busied herself with
some tidying around the room

CHARLOTTE
I shall never forgive myself
(but never forgive herself for
what)

LUCY
You always say that Charlotte
but you always do forgive your-
self quite readily

She goes out briskly

CHARLOTTE watches GEORGE go up the drive and begin to
climb the slope behind the house

It is CHARLOTTE now who has tears in her eyes
DUSK EXTERIOR GARDEN

LUCY still walking briskly passes CECIL who is again
reading Miss Lavishs book on the terrace He wants to
read her another comic passage but she walks past him

LUCY goes through the garden to the place in the
shrubbery where GEORGE kissed her But now everything
is different - the brightness has died out of the air
afternoon is drawing into evening and the lengthening
shadows are creeping over the house

Only FREDDY and MR FFLOYD are still calling out in
jolly voices as they bounce balls around on the court -
One ball comes bouncing into the shrubbery where LUCY
catches it

FREDDY comes to retrieve it

FREDDY
Hallo Lucy Theres still light
enough for another set if you
twoll hurry

LUCY
Mr Emerson has had to go

FREDDY
What a nuisance

He calls to CECIL sitting on the terrace

FREDDY
I say Cecil do play theres a
good chap Just this once -
its Ffloyds last day

CECIL
My dear Freddy as you well
remarked this morning Theres
are some chaps who are no good
for anything but books I
plead guilty to being such a
chap

FREDDY bangs the ball across the net in disappointment
Pleased with his repartee pleased with himself CECIL
continues to amuse himself over his book

We see him from the POV of LUCY

He adjusts his pincenez he smiles he swings one
elegant foot

We see the scales fall from LUCYs eyes as it were She
turns away from him decisively turns her back on him

as if to shut him out and the life theyd planned
together

TITLE CARD LYING TO CECIL
NIGHT INTERIOR SMOKING ROOM

All through this scene where LUCY breaks off her engage-
ment she is shown to be irritated and sometimes angry
with CECIL - irritated and angered by herself of course
as much as with him - while he is always shown as gentle
rational calm - if bewildered by what shes saying It
is his finest hour in the film he gets to redeem himself
somewhat Forster wrote of CECIL here For all his
culture Cecil was an ascetic at heart and nothing in
his love became him like the leaving of it

CU CECIL taking off his pincenez looking bewildered

CECIL
(incredulously) Because I
wouldnt play tennis with Freddy

LUCY is on her knees by the sideboard putting away some
whiskey bottles She doesnt turn to him as he speaks

CECIL
--I never do play tennis I
never could

LUCY
we Oh forget the tennis It was
just the last straw Im sorry
Cecil I cant marry you and
you will thank me for saying so
one day We are too different

She speaks irritably and all her fussing around the side-
board is irritable

But CECIL is stammering with true feeling

CECIL
But I loved you and I did
think you loved me

LUCY
(rising) I did not I thought
I did at first Im sorry
And as for your loving me - no
you dont Cecil not really

She pauses He stands looking at her speechless for
once Then an inspiration strikes her

LUCY
You dont Its only as some-
thing else - as something you
can own - a painting a Leonardo
I dont want to be a Leonardo
I want to be myself Oh dont
lets go on now I shall only
say things that will make me
unhappy afterwards

CECIL
You dont love me evidently
I dare say youre right not to
But it would hurt a little less
if I knew why -

LUCY
Because - youre the sort who
cant know anyone intimately
least of all a woman

A horrified look comes into his eyes
LUCY
I dont mean exactly that but
you will go on asking questions -

He doesnt defend himself Instead he looks at her as
she struggles to express herself

LUCY
You wrap yourself up in art and
books and music and you want to
wrap me up Thats why Im
breaking off my engagement

There is a pause Then CECIL says with emotion

CECIL
Its true
LUCY
(feeling ashamed) True on the

whole

Another pause CECIL speaks gently with growing
admiration Now that hes losing her each moment
she seems more desirable

CECIL
--Youre so different tonight
Like a different person - speaking
with a new voice

LUCY
(her irritation bursting into
uncontrollable anger) If you
think Im in love with someone
else youre very much mistaken

CECIL
Of course I dont -

LUCY
(cutting across his protestation)
If a girl breaks off her engage-
ment everyone always thinks Oh
she has someone else - she hopes
to get someone else Its
disgusting brutal

CECIL
No Lucy no I beg your pardon
You must excuse me if I say stupid
things but my brain has gone to
pieces

After a silence ashamed of her outburst impressed by
his dignity

LUCY
I really think wed better go to
bed if you dont mind

CECIL
«--Let me light your candle
shall I

He does so carefully and gently and gives it to her
His voice is breaking as he speaks again

CECIL
I must actually thank you for what
youve done - for your courage in
doing it I do admire you for it
Will you shake hands

LUCY
Of course I will Cecil

They solemnly shake hands and then go out into the hall

LUCY
Goodnight Cecil Im sorry
about it Thank you very much
for taking it so well

94 NIGHT INTERIOR PASSAGE AND STAIRS

CECIL watches LUCY go upstairs the shadows from the
banisters passing over her face like the beat of wings

95 NIGHT EXTERIOR GARDEN

CECIL looks at Windy Corner as if he were saying goodbye
He wanders about He sees a figure glimmering in the dark
on the bench where he once proposed to LUCY He
approaches -

CECIL
(surprised) Miss Bartlett

He sits next to her

CECIL
Arent you going to bed

CHARLOTTE
No I like sitting here I come
here quite often after everyones
asleepPerhaps that surprises
you

CECIL supports his head between his hands

CECIL
Lucy has broken off our engagement

CHARLOTTE says nothing

CECIL
e--If there were areason —- it
might be easier even if there
were someone else -

CHARLOTTE
I hope you dont think that

CECIL
Of course I dont Of course
not she didnt have to accuse
me of that

A silence

CECIL
Perhaps she is right and I
cant love her as she should
beloved that I cant be
with anyone that way

CHARLOTTE is looking up at the house which is quite dark
except for Lucys window LUCYs shadow can be seen
moving against it

A silence Perhaps they get up and walk about before he
starts up again

CECIL
Perhaps Im one of those whos
meant to live alone Some of
us areI think perhaps you are
too Miss Bartlett

CHARLOTTE
(after a pause) I dare say it
seems so now but it wasnt always
Not at all always Certainly not
when I was Lucys ageLook
shes blown out her candie

For the light in Lucys window is extinguished and
everything is dark

MISS CATHERINE ALAN is writing a letter to MR BEEBEE
sitting at a little writing table in a Spartan room We

hear the words of the letter aloud As she is writing
she gets up to put a sixpence in the gas fire and it
makes a clink in the gloom Traffic sounds of the city
come in from outside

MISS ALAN (VO)
Since Florence did my sister
so much good we do not see why
we should not try Athens this
winter

She goes to put the coin in and returns

MISS ALAN (VO)
«»-Of course Athens is a plunge
and the doctor has ordered her
special digestive bread but
after all we can take that with
us and it is only getting first
into a steamer and then into a

DAY EXTERIOR ROAD OVER THE HILL TO WINDY
CORNER

MR BEEBEE is bicycling along through a blustery after-
noon The sky is dark with clouds the wind blows
trees groan and the first autumn leaves fly away

He is smiling to himself We hear MISS ALANs letter

MISS ALAN (VO)
Dear Mr Beebee is there an
English Church I do not expect
we shall go any further than
Athens but if you know of a
really comfortable pension at
Constantinople we would be so
grateful

He sees CECIL and FREDDY coming towards him up the road
on foot Some way behind the carriage with a trunk and
other luggage in it is making its way up slowly They
meet and shake hands

MR BEEBEE
So youre off for a minute
Mr Vyse

CECIL
Yes

FREDDY looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable

MR BEEBEE
I was coming to show Miss Honey-
church this delightful letter
from those friends of hers the
Miss Alans

He quotes from it

MR BEEBEE
Isnt it wonderful Isnt it
Romance

CECIL

(civilly) Im sure Lucy will
be amused

FREDDY
Have you any matches Im sorry
to interrupt

CECIL
(in a more kindly tone than
usual) I have

He hands him his silver match box

MR BEEBEE
Youve never met these Miss Alans
have you Mr Vyse

CECIL
Never

MR BEEBEE
Then you dont see the wonder of
their Greek visit I havent
been to Greece myself and dont
mean to go Its altogether too
big for our little lot Dont
you think so - All right Freddy
Im not going to be clever - give
me those matches when youre done
with them I was saying if our
poor little Cockney lives must
have a background let it be
Italian

He lights a cigarette Durin¢e the above the carriage
makes it to the top and the two young MEN climb in

CECIL
Youre quite right Greece is
not for our little lot Goodbye

1il

The carriage moves off but stops after a dozen yards
FREDDY comes running back to ask for CECILs match box

FREDDY
Cecils hard hit Lucy wont
marry him

MR BEEBEE
But when -
FREDDY
Late last night I must go
MR BEEBEE
Perhaps they wont want me down
there
FREDDY

No - go on Goodbye

He runs after the carriage and MR BEEBEE gets on his
bicycle smiling with satisfaction at the good news
slapping the saddle of the bike approvingly

looking cross is tying them up CHARLOTTE inappro-
priately dressed for the task offers unwanted assistance
MINNIE and the gardeners CHILD each hold the end of a
long piece of twine

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Not the scissors thank you
Charlotte when both my hands
are full already How do you

MINNIE
Everyone is so horrid today Uncle

you like to join us Miss Bartlett

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Yes Charlotte I don’t want you

CHARLOTTE
Thank you but you have no one
to help you Even my poor
services are better than nothing

MINNIE looks pleased that CHARLOTTE isnt going to tea

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Oh look out

For CHARLOTTE in lunging at a falling plant has stepped
on it MRS HONEYCHURCH looks ready to explode

From inside LUCY can be heard playing Mozart

MR BEEBEE
Its terrible this havoc among
the flowersAh Mozart today -
less exciting than Beethoven
perhaps but also less unsettling

He walks toward the drawing room with his letter
DAY INTERIOR DRAWING ROOM

When MR BEEBEE comes in LUCY is still tinkering at
Mozart but stops quite soon

MR BEEBEE
(talking fast) Here is this
most delightful letter from the
Miss Alans who are making plans
for a thrilling trip to Greece -
I must read you this - (reading)
I do not think we shall go
any further than Athens but if
you know of a really comfortable
pension at Constantinople
Constantinople Isnt it
delightful They will end by
going round the world

LUCY -
(echoing in a dull voice)
Delightful
He puts down the letter
A pause
MR BEEBEE

(after clearing his throat) Miss
Honeychurch your brother told me

LUCY
(with a trace of annoyance) Oh
did he
MR BEEBEE

I neednt say that it will go
no further

LUCY
(striking a note on the piano
for each name) Mother - Charlotte
- Cecil - Freddy - you (and
then striking a sixth note)

MR BEEBEE
If youll let me say so Im
certain you have done the right
thing

LUCY
(in a high artificial voice)
Oh do tell me more about the
Miss Alans How perfectly
splendid of them to go abroad

MR BEEBEE
I want them to start from Venice
and go in a cargo steamer down
the Illyrian coast

LUCY looks suddenly alert

Lucy
Oh I long to join themDid
Freddy say whether he was driving
straight back

MR BEEBEE
No he didnt
LUCY
Because I hope he wont go

gossiping

He puts the letter away expecting her to go on about
her broken engagement But she says instead

Lucy
How perfectly splendid of them
to go abroad I wish theyd
take me

He sees to his surprise that she is serious

iol

MR BEEBEE
Would your mother spare you again
so soon Youve scarcely been
back three months

LUCY
She must spare me I simply
must go away I have to

She runs her hands hysterically through her hair

LUCY
Dont you see that I have to
go away
CHARLOTTE comes in
LUCY

«-eCharlotte isnt it too romantic
The Miss Alans are going to
Constantinople

MR BEEBEE
So far only to Athens -

LUCY
I have always longed to go to
Constantinople Athens I mean

MINNIE BEEBEE comes in to claim MR BEEBEE

MR BEEBEE
In lieu of Constantinople could
Minnie and I not lure you to tea

CHARLOTTE completely bewildered
starts protesting) Dont you see

where (striking her knees with
clenched fists) I must get away

(MORE)
LUCY
ever so farBefore its known
(impatiently as CHARLOTTE looks
puzzled) that Ive broken off my

ideas

CHARLOTTE
You mean Mr Emerson might think
it was on his account

LUCY
How slow you are Charlotte
How slow

CHARLOTTE
Of course there must be no gossip
in Summer Street But to go all
the way to Greece -

LUCY
(interrupting) © You saw him your-
self that day you heard him If
he gets to know of this goodness
knows what will happen

There is a pause They look at each other

But she doesnt look at CHARLOTTE

goes on -

CHARLOTTE
(hesitating) Lucy are you
completely sure -

LUCY
unhesitating) Yes What are
you thinking of -

CHARLOTTE

(swallowing) - completely sure that

you want to go to Greece

LUCY
Well - of course - of course -
of course

LUCY
I would have thought you would
want to help me - that you would
be the first to go to Mother and
say Lucy must go to Greece at
once - that you would want to do
this for me -

She turns away and

CHARLOTTE
Of course I want to do every-
thing that is right for you can
you doubt that for one moment
Everything that is good for you

FREDDY comes in
LUCY
Im telling you what is right
and good for me - oh please

CHARLOTTE presses LUCYs hand and goes out

LUCY sits at the piano again

FREDDY
Whys she look like that

MR BEEBEE
It could be that Or because

MINNIE
Is that whats happened Has
Lucy got disengaged

MR BEEBEE
Attend to what Im saying dis-
engaged in the sense of not being
an active participant of being
merely a spectator

MINNIE
Because if shes got disengaged
from Mr Vyse then its not so

full please Minnie

DUSK INTERIOR DRAWING ROOM

LUCY is playing and singing FREDDY is still sitting on
the floor leaning against her

(singing)
Stop thine ear against the singer
From the red gold keep thy finger

FREDDY
The tune’s right enough but the
words are rotten Why throw up
the sponge

LUCY
How stupidly you talk

FREDDY
«e-Tell you what I could do run
up to London and see Cecil If
you like I could

LUCY
Sit quiet and listen (singing)
Vacant heart and hand and eye
Easy live and quiet die

DUSK EXTERIOR GARDEN

MRS HONEYCHURCH is still struggling with her dahlias -
getting more and more cross every minute with them and
with the Garden BOY

At this inauspicious moment CHARLOTTE her skirt blowing
in the wind comes to make her announcement What she
says and what MRS HONEYCHURCH replies is lost in the
windstorm so the scene is a kind of pantomime of
gesticulating more seen than heard

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Look at my scarlet pompoms isnt
it a tragedy

CHARLOTTE
Lucy hae a plan -

MRS HONEYCHURCH
(not hearing because of the wind)
And Im perfectly certain that the
orange cactus will go before I can
get to it

CHARLOTTE
(shouting) Miss Alans are going
abroad Theyre going to Greece

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Good luck to them

CHARLOTTE
(bravely shouting) Lucy would
like to join them as far as Athens

MRS HONEYCHURCH sits down there and then in the flower
bed and stares up into CHARLOTTEs face

CHARLOTTE
(less bravely) And on to
Delphi if the roads are safe

At that moment the orange cactus falls

DUSK EXTERIOR WINDY CORNER IN ITS SETTING

MR BEEBEE and MINNIE are descending the hill toward
Windy Corner

LUCYS VOICE can be heard singing

Stop thine ear against the singer
From the red gold keep thy finger

As they draw near the house they can see LUCY through
the glass doors

FREDDY has his head against her as she sits at the
piano and an unlit pipe between his teeth

LUCY
(singing)
Vacant heart and hand and eye
Easy live and quiet die

The song sounds even more mournful than the autumn gale
but not so the piano accompaniment which appears to be
soaring on wings of its own

DAY INTERIOR THE EMERSON HOUSE

As in the earlier scene when we saw them move in there

was a cheerful air of unpacking now there is a depressed
air of packing up giving up departing

GEORGE could be struggling on the stairs with the big
picture by Raphael carrying it down as we saw him take

it up before He might then turn to packing books into
Oxes

MR EMERSON
Take all those but leave me Thoreau
till I leave I need him by me now

GEORGE drags a filled box away to stack with other boxes
As he does so speaking in a dull matter-of-fact tone

GEORGE
Its an ugly house We never did
like the house

MR EMERSON
Whats a house Its what you
put in it - the light you fill
it with thats what makes a
house (looking out at the rain)
Why is rain even worse in the
country

POV MR EMERSON water dripping from the trees like
tears soaking into the grass falling onto water
falling on the tombstones in the churchyard (whatever one
sees from his window - in any case it should look like
the world is dissolving in tears)

MR EMERSON
(turning from the window) And
when we first came the sun was
shining all the time Yes every
day was bright

GEORGE
(painfully straightening up from
carrying a heavy load) You cant
expect the summer to last forever

He is very gloomy he looks like a hero in defeat His
FATHER comes over to him and puts his hand on GEORGEs
shoulder This hand trembles Obviously he would like
to do more - embrace his SON comfort him - but there is
something granite about GEORGE that does not encourage
the soft gestures of comfort

Watched by MR EMERSON GEORGE stoically continues to
pack

GEORGE
I mustnt miss the train The
movers can do the rest - no not
you I dont want you straining
your back I wont be coming
next weekend Theres no point
Ill come to take you back to
town the week after

MR EMERSON accompanies GEORGE to the door and stands
there watching while GEORGE gets on his cycle

DAY EXTERIOR COUNTRY ROADS

GEORGE cycling to the station - but very differently
from the way we saw him travel the same road in an
earlier scene Then it was all downhill and he rode as
a conquering hero now he is pedalling painfully uphill
hunched against the wind and the rain

DAY INTERIOR BLOOMSBURY HOTEL LOUNGE
LONDON

The MISS ALANS are entertaining LUCY and MRS HONEYCHURCH
to tea There are other elderly LADIES sitting around
doing the same LUCY and MRS HONEYCHURCH are the
liveliest looking elements in the scene which is other-
wise hushed genteel and in terms of any life or gaiety
virtually moribund

CATHERINE ALAN
»-Paper soap is a great help
towards freshening up ones face
on a trainBut of course you
know all about these things and
you have Mr Vyse to help you

MRS HONEYCHURCH begins to drum nervously on her card
case

CATHERINE ALAN
We think it so good of Mr Vyse
to spare you But perhaps he will
come out and join you later

TERESA ALAN
(the more acute and less kindly
of the two sisters) Or does his
work keep him in London

CATHERINE ALAN
We shall meet him when he sees
you off I do so long to

MRS HONEYCHURCH
(cutting her off) No one will
see Lucy off She doesnt like
it

TERESA ALAN
Really How funny I should
have thought that in this case -

MRS HONEYCHURCH rises decisively

CATHERINE ALAN
Oh Mrs Honeychurch you arent
going Its such a pleasure to
have met you

MISS TERESA and MISS CATHERINE chatter away as they see
their visitors off - We shall write to you very often
and send pretty cards from every place We know how
anxious you will be to hear naturally of course both
you and Mr Vyse

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Yes and were seen through which
is most unpleasant

DAY INTERIOR BLOOMSBURY HOTEL LOUNGE

The two OLD LADIES return to their table

MISS CATHERINE
(peering into the teapot) Is
there a drop left Oh quite a
bit left They were in such a
hurry they hardly had time to
enjoy their tea (she pours
it also examines the sandwiches)
Do you think these are curling
just the tiniest bit (but she
takes one and eats it) Do you
know Teresa I could not help
thinking that our dear Lucy did
not look -

MISS TERESA
I wish you would learn to finish
your sentences Catherine you
are getting worse and worse

MISS CATHERINE
(indicating she cannot speak
because of having her mouth full
but when that difficulty is
overcome she continues) - no
did not look like a bride-to-be

MISS TERESA
Oh And pray how should a
bride-to-be look according to
your great wisdom and experience
in these matters

MISS CATHERINE
I cant say exactly how only
that she lacked something Yes
- well - if you must know
Teresa radiance (and in
pronouncing it she loads that
word and glows with it)

MISS TERESA
(after regarding her speculatively)
Do you know what I think I think
you need cooling off Perhaps we
should be going to a colder climate
- to Russia not to Greece

MISS CATHERINE
(playfully shuddering) Brrrrr

MISS TERESA is hard put to it to continue to look severe

DAY EXTERIOR LONDON STREET

ili

Still in drizzle and continuing their earlier conver-
sation MRS HONEYCHURCH sounds very annoyed and so
does LUCY

MRS HONEYCHURCH
I shall never understand this
hole and corner work Youve got
rid of Cecil - well and good and
Im thankful - but why not announce
it

LUCY
I promised not to till I left
England Its only for a few days

MRS HONEYCHURCH
But why at all

They have reached a bookstore near the British Museum
and turn in

112 DAY INTERIOR LONDON BOOKSHOP

They go over to the guidebook section - as LUCY stretches
up for the Baedeker for Greece

MRS HONEYCHURCH
I still dont understand it
Why Why Greece Why go rushing
off to the ends of the earth

LUCY pretends to be engrossed in Baedeker

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Im beginning to think that youre
tired of your home - of Windy
Corner -

LUCY
(irritable and petulant) Oh
Mother what rubbish you talk

MRS HONEYCHURCH
- and tired of Freddy and me

A silence during which LUCY takes down another book

Lucy
Of course Im not tired of Windy
Corner

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Then why not say so at once instead
of considering for half an hour
first

LUCY
(leafing through book) 0f
course I want to live at home
But as were talking about it
I may as well say that in the
future I shall want to come up
to London more I might even
share a flat for a little with
some other girl You see I come
into my money next year

Tears come into MRS HONEYCHURCHs eyes

Seeing her MOTHERs look LUCY screws up her mouth and
ee backtracks

LUCY —
Perhaps I spoke hastily

MRS HONEYCHURCH
(flashing out) Oh goodness
How you do remind me of Charlotte
Bartlett

LUCY
Charlotte

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Charlotte to the T

She purses up her mouth the way LUCY did just now and
the way CHARLOTTE does often LUCY turns her face away
as one offended

MRS HONEYCHURCH
There Charlotte again

LUCY
(through clenched teeth and
a leaving her mother to go up to

the cashier) I dont know what
you mean Charlotte and I are
not in the least alike

MRS HONEYCHURCH
(following LUCY) No you used
not to be

MRS HONEYCHURCH stands looking at her daughter counting
out change She does resemble CHARLOTTE pinched
anxious and prematurely spinsterish

MRS HONEYCHURCH relents as she watches LUCY anxiety
and concern softening her expression

113 DAY INTERIOR RAILWAY CARRIAGE

The train rushes through a sodden landscape Neither
LUCY nor MRS HONEYCHURCH speak The train whistles
forlornly and the rain-streaked glass rattles and shakes -

LUCY makes a show of reading the Baedeker guide shes
just bought

el She stops at a photograph of the Charioteer of Delphi
struck by the statues grave youthful masculine
confidence

114 DAY EXTERIOR EMERSON VILLA

CHARLOTTE passing sees Emerson furniture being carried
out She walks over to MR BEEBEEs house

115 DAY INTERIOR MR BEEBEES HOUSE - PASSAGE

CHARLOTTE
Oh Mr Beebee what is happening
to your neighbours

MR BEEBEE
Alas they are moving out Old
Mr Emersons rheumatism has come
on and George says it is too far
out of town -

Through the open library door CHARLOTTE sees MR EMERSON
sitting by the fire

CHARLOTTE

Might I trespass on your kindness
Mr Beebee and wait here for Mrs
Honeychurch to fetch me in the
carriage

MR BEEBEE
Most certainly with pleasure -
do join Mr Emerson who has taken
refuge in there from the movers
Only you must excuse me - (the
organ can be heard from the church)
- as you can hear they have got
going there -

He goes out She goes into the library
116 DAY INTERIOR MR BEEBEES LIBRARY

MR EMERSON is sitting by the fire He looks wan and
weak but smiles at CHARLOTTE with a childlike sweetness

CHARLOTTE
Im very sorry to hear Mr
Emerson that the house has
brought on your rheumatism

MR EMERSON
Its not the rheumatism its my
boyGeorge is so sorry I
cannot blame him - and yet I
wish he had told me first
CHARLOTTE
(a pause) He never told you
- not what happened in Italy

MR EMERSON
Not one word

CHARLOTTE
almost to herself) Yes thats
what Lucy thought

MR EMERSON
I was only told last Sunday -

CHARLOTTE
What were you told

MR EMERSON
That he loves her

CHARLOTTE flinches blushes turns away

MR EMERSON
(regarding her keenly) Wont
you sit down

CHARLOTTE
I think I hear the carriage -
it would be most discourteous
to keep my cousin waiting

MR EMERSON
No there isnt any carriage
Sit down my dear

CHARLOTTE hesitates then sits - or rather perches
uncomfortably

CHARLOTTE
(biting her lip rigidly) There
appears to have been a series of
unfortunate misunderstandings

MR EMERSON
Worse than that Miss Bartlett
Everyones been lying except
George And now heres Miss
Honeychurch marrying Mr Vyse
in January - (he trails off as
CHARLOTTE shakes her head)

CHARLOTTE
Miss Honeychurch - Lucy - is
taking a tour of Greece with
(MORE)

CHARLOTTE
our friends the Misses Alan
you may remember them from the
Pension Bertolini Miss Teresa
and her younger sister Miss
Catherine - (or however far she
gets before he has taken it in
and interrupts her)

MR EMERSON
(almost shouting) She is not
getting married

CHARLOTTE
Miss Honeychurch has broken off
her engagement It was all done
with great tact and discretion
naturally and for the time being
we would prefer it to be kept
quiet -

MR EMERSON
interrupting again) Oh theres
a time for keeping quiet Miss
Bartlett and theres a time for
speaking out No you dont hear
any carriage - but why dont you
sit back - lean back - make your-
self more comfortable - here take
this - (he puts a cushion behind
her) - there thats better

You look much better

And CHARLOTTE now with a cushion at her back does look
better more relaxed less rigid

DUSK EXTERIOR LANE IN SURREY

LUCY and MRS HONEYCHURCH are seated in the Honeychurch
carriage POWELL is driving them The rain has stopped

Showers of water fall from the overhanging trees and
rattle on the hood of the carriage The carriage-lamp
passes its searchlight over mud and fallen leaves

They are coming in to Summer Street It is oppressive
inside the carriage

LUCY
Cant we have the hood down

MRS HONEYCHURCH
(with sudden tenderness) Very well
old lady Stop the horse

The horse stops LUCY and POWELL wrestle with the hood
and get it down When it is down LUCY sees Cissie
Villa exactly opposite with the movers carrying out
furniture

LUCY
Is that house to let again
Powell

POWELL
Yes miss

LUCY

Have they gone

POWELL
Sir Harrys looking for new
tenants I heard

LUCY sinks back The cottage recedes into the distance
The horses hooves strike the road

LUCY is in a kind of despair and sits numbly thinking
about her recent actions

MRS HONEYCHURCH
What a pity about the Emersons
Freddy will be so sorry and indeed
sO am ILucy go and get
Charlotte from Mr Beebees and
do hurry both of you because Mary
has her fishpie inSuch an
agreeable family What a pity

LUCY gets down from the carriage

She goes up to MR BEEBEEs house and rings the bell
TITLE CARD LYING TO MR EMERSON

DUSK INTERIOR MR BEEBEES LIBRARY

LUCY opening the door sees MR EMERSON and CHARLOTTE

sitting as before by the fire Before she can say
anything

CHARLOTTE
Lucy Mr Emerson says it is all
his fault

MR EMERSON

Because I told him to trust to
love I told him George love
and do what you will Its what
I taught him and so you see it is
all my fault

CHARLOTTE uses this speech to make her get-away - that
is during it she gets up and tries to slip out of the
door

LUCY
Where are you going

CHARLOTTE
Your dear mother has most thought-
fully come to fetch me in her
carriage and I have not been
brought up to keep anyone waiting
least of all a kind hostess

When LUCY tries to go out with her she pushes her back
into the room and shuts the door on her

119 DUSK EXTERIOR CARRIAGE
MRS HONEYCHURCH is very irritated
When she sees CHARLOTTE emerging -

MRS HONEYCHURCH
Now where is Lucy No you get
in Charlotte If Marys fish-pie
is spoiled she will mope from now
till next Friday -

CHARLOTTE gets in seating herself humbly with her back
to the horse

When MRS HONEYCHURCH protests -
CHARLOTTE
This will do very well for me -
I must not inconvenience you -
When MRS HONEYCHURCH insists -
CHARLOTTE
I shall make myself as tiny as
a mouse
And she does so to MRS HONEYCHURCHs exasperation
120 DUSK INTERIOR MR BEEBEES LIBRARY

MR EMERSON and LUCY All through this scene we hear
the sound of the litany

LUCY
Mr Emerson I have no wish to
discuss your son or even to hear
(MORE)

LUCY
his name mentioned He has mis-
behaved from the first (facing
MR EMERSON) Why he has behaved
abominably Do you know what he
did

MR EMERSON
(gently) Not “abominably He
only tried when he should not have
tried

LUCY
No of course Abominable is
much too strong a word Im
sorry I used it about your son
I must leave you - Mother and
Charlotte are waiting -

MR EMERSON
And now hes gone under

A pause
MR EMERSON
(striking his palms together in
silence his head falling on
his chest) Gone under

Another pause She looks frightened

LUCY
in a shaky voice) Is your
son i111

MR EMERSON

No George is never ill but he
«eegoes under Gives up and -
(makes a sinking gesture) It
was the same in Florence after
you left Horrible Then we
take the house here and he goes
bathing with your brother and
became better You saw him
bathing

LUCY
Im sorry but its no good
discussing this affair

MR EMERSON
George is coming to take me up
to London He cant bear to be
here and I must be where he is
(MORE)

MR EMERSON
He says the thought of seeing
you and of hearing about you -

LUCY
(in a kindly tone of voice for
the firsttime) Oh Mr Emerson
dont leave - at least not on my
account Im going to Greece
Dont leave your comfortable house
You mustnt Ive been bother
enough to everybody by now -

MR EMERSON
Why are you going to Greece
(when LUCY has no answer) My
dear Im worried about you It
seems to me - (he says this
dreamily posing a hypothesis
almost to himself) - that you
are in a muddle It seems to
me - (continuing his hypothesis)
- that the reason you are going
to Greece - the reason you have
broken your engagement - (yes
Miss Bartlett told me) - is
that you love George

Lucy
(gasping) Oh Oh how like a
man - I mean to suppose that a
woman is always thinking about a
man

MR EMERSON
But you are

She sinks down on a chair completely bewildered all her
thoughts and feelings turned upside down

MR EMERSON
You see my dear you can ignore
love you can muddle it you can
do whatever you like - but you can
never pull it out of youLook
all the lights gone out of your
pretty face - just like its gone
out of GeorgeI cannot bear it
And now Ive made you cry Dear
girl forgive me

LUCY
(in a panic) But I have to go to
Greece now - the tickets bought
and everything - its impossible

MR EMERSON
Theres only one thing impossible
and thats to love and to part

VOICE of MRS HONEYCHURCH calling for LUCY
LUCY gets up glad of an excuse to run away
But MR EMERSON gets up too -

MR EMERSON
(pressing home on her) You love
George You love the boy body
and soul as he loves you

LUCY
as she lowers her veil tears
pouring down her face) But of
course I do What did you all
think

She hurries out with him close behind her MRS HONEY-

CHURCHs voice calling

LUCY
Oh please not Mr Emerson -
Mothers calling - I must go -
they trust me -

MR EMERSON
But why should they when you have
deceived everyone including your-
self

MRS HONEYCHURCH is still calling but LUCY does not call
back She has stopped still waiting for MR EMERSON to

say more
DUSK EXTERIOR CARRIAGE

MRS HONEYCHURCH
«if Lucy has so much to say to
Mr Beebee then let her walk home
Go on Powell

The carriage starts with MRS HONEYCHURCH grumbling to

CHARLOTTE

MRS HONEYCHURCH
On no account am I going to have
Mary moping I dont know what
has got into Lucy she was never
so inconsiderate But now one
week Italy next week Greece -

CHARLOTTE
The plan for Greece may be
cancelled

MRS HONEYCHURCH
What Now When everything is
turned topsy-turvy -

CHARLOTTE is constantly craning back out of the carriage -
She sees LUCY running behind them -

CHARLOTTE
(in great excitement) Oh stop
Lucy has something to tell us
Do stop

She gets up in the carriage - she looks drunk with her
hat and veil slipped over her eyes - she is in danger of
falling out so that MRS HONEYCHURCH has to hold her by
clasping her around the knees

122 NIGHT INTERIOR ‘CHARLOTTES BEDROOM IN
TUNBRIDGE WELLS

CHARLOTTE now entirely back in character is putting
herself to bed

Encased in flannel night-gown and cotton night-cap she
slips her hand under the neatly turned-down blankets to
make sure of her hot water bottle

She gets into bed From her bedside table she takes an
envelope with foreign stamps and draws out a letter
which appears to have been already read more than once -

Lucy (V0)
Dear Cousin Charlotte You will be
glad to hear that the Pension
Bertolini is entirely its own dear
self Even the guests appear to
be just another set of Miss Alans
- Miss Lavish - Mr Beebee - and
indeed Charlotte and Lucy -

123 DAY INTERIOR PENSION DINING ROOM
It is exactly as beforeand - yes the GUESTS do seem to
be yet another set of English spinsters and clergymen
except for LUCY and GEORGE who are sitting there

The bottles of wine and water still alternate down the
table -

The GUESTS are still cutting meat with English boarding
house refinement -

126

Two NEWCOMERS enter a young GIRL and her CHAPERON
They are received with the stiff good breeding appropriate
to newcomers who have not yet proved themselves

Their seats are opposite LUCY and GEORGE They whisper
to each other - the CHAPERON trying to dampen the ardour
of the GIRL

But finally the GIRL breaks out turning to GEORGE and
LUCY

GIRL
But we were promised rooms with
a view -

CHAPERON
Hush dear we mustnt -

GIRL
Its so unfair (appealing to
GEORGE and LUCY) Dont you agree
that on ones first visit to Italy
one must have a room with a view

GEORGE
We have a room with a view (but
he doesnt offer to give it up)

NIGHT INTERIOR CHARLOTTES BEDROOM

CHARLOTTE puts away the letter She blows out her candle
She sleeps She dreams

NIGHT INTERIOR ROOM WITH A VIEW IN CHARLOTTES
DREAM

GEORGE and LUCY are standing by the open window kissing
- Dissolve -

NIGHT INTERIOR ROOM WITH A VIEW

GEORGE and LUCY really are kissing by the open window
standing against the same view she saw on her first night
the lights dancing in the Arno the cypresses of San
Miniato and the foothills of the Appenines black against
the rising moon

There is a hiss like a serpents from underneath the
window

GEORGE and LUCY draw apart and look out

A COACHMAN is eagerly offering them his carriage for
tomorrow

COACHMAN
Signorino domano faremo un
giro -

LUCY

(leaning forward) lLascia prego
lascia Siamo sposati

COACHMAN
Scusi tanto signora

He whips up his horse and drives off singing GEORGE
shuts the window shutters And they continue to kiss
with increasing ardour breaking not only out of

Charlottes dream but - passion mounting - out of the

19th century and - with passion unconfined - into the
20th
