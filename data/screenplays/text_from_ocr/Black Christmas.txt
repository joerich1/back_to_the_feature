EXT HOUSE - NIGHT - Falling snow drifts upon the Mansard rooftop of a large
isolated and decrepit New England colonial Paned
windows in the gables are cracked and broken Worn stone
steps lead to a rotting open porch An equally ragged 48
Chevy Aerosedan sits in the driveway

Behind the house lies a void of evergreen and leafless
birch Far down the road lies a lone neighborhood house
There are only two houses on this street

Here Christmas lights are strung but many of the fat
bulbs are burned out The building appears like a
haunted house on Christmas Eve The windows are dark
except for a pale blue light in the living room

INT HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE - A TREE ORNAMENT

A reflection of a bassinet and an eerie blue light wraps
around a silver and gold glass bulb celebrating Babys
First Christmas - 1970

hunched at the foot of a second hand bassinet hooded by
worn blankets A gooseneck office lamp shining a
purplish light arcs over the crib

Across the lid of a well worn lighter Khe Sanh 67-68
On the base PVT LENZ FRANK is above a Marine Corp
Chesty Bulldog and an inscription Not afraid just
lonely

THE FATHER

Lifts his eyes lined with dark circles and reaches out
to peel back the edge of a blanket checking inside the
bassinet

CAMERA PUSHES PAST the FATHER to the bassinet MOVING
INTO the opening of the blankets to REVEAL the eyes of a
newborn

Although not demonic or supernatural the eyes are
unsettling inhuman Yellowed with a chronic jaundice
the eyes are much too focused and intense for a newborn

BILLYS MOTHER

slumps in the corner of the couch back to father and
son as if imagining herself as far from them as
possible An empty bottle of Tanqueray sits on the coffee
table She turns toward her husband and child looking at
them blank
She stands drunk and moves toward the Evergleam pink
aluminum Christmas tree The mother reaches out

to pose the question which both understand is
unanswerable

They must have been in the house since he
escaped

Well never know Kelli How could we
ever know now

Kelli averts her eyes Leigh considers shrugs

LEIGH (CONTD)
I think maybe they were doing the

This Christmas they came back home
looking to find their family But you
dont need to find them for the same
reason you cant escape them
