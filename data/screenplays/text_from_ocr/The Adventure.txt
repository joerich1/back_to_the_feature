It is the afternoon of a summers day Anna a twenty-five-year-old brunette
comes out from the entrance of a stately building and walks along a pathway
that leads up to a dirt road She is in a great hurry and becomes a little
annoyed and surprised at seeing her father a meticulously dressed and
elderly gentleman standing near the curb busily talking to his chauffeur in
front of a black British car

ANNA
So there you are Ive been upstairs looking
all over for you

There is a moment of silence during which Annas father deliberately ignores
her presence She stares at him intently trying to determine his mood and
wondering how she is going to tell him what she has to say before she leaves
Finally he turns around and faces her

FATHER
Oh I thought you were already on the high
seas

Anna is barely able to control her temper but realizing that the discussion
is about to take the usual sarcastic turn she immediately checks herself

ANNA
No not yet Dad

Her father fixes her with a long ironic look Conscious of his daughters
haste he is apparently trying his best to detain her

FATHER
Isnt it fashionable any more to put on a
sailors cap with the name of the yacht

ANNA
No Dad it isnt

There is another moment of silence Meanwhile a car has pulled up on the
other side of the road It is Claudia a twenty-four-year-old blonde and a
friend of Annas Both she and the driver get out of the car and remain
discreetly in the background waiting for the conversation to end Annas
father resumes speaking after a cursory nod to Claudia who in turn
responds with a polite but half-hearted smile

FATHER
And how long will you be away
ANNA
Four or five days

FATHER
(resignedly)
Oh very well Ill just spend the weekend
alone by myself and take a little rest I
should be used to it by now

Anna glares at him furiously but still manages to restrain herself

ANNA
Used to what

FATHER
To the fact of my retirement not only as a
diplomat but also as a father

ANNA
(protestingly and with a
deep sense of compassion)
But how could you say such a thing

FATHER
Because its true After thirty years -- not
having ever spoken the truth to anyone I
should at least allow myself to do so with my
own daughter

ANNA
And have you any other truths to tell me

FATHER
You already know what they are

ANNA
You mean Sandro dont you Well I beg of
you please spare me that Goodbye Dad

She kisses him on the cheek but the father remains unmoved It is obvious
that he still has something else he wants to say to her In fact after
gazing upon his daughter with a certain amount of pity he finally does say
it

FATHER

That type will never marry you my child

Anna has a difficult time restraining herself but manages somehow to keep
calm as she answers

ANNA
Up until now Dad Ive been the one who hasnt
wanted to marry him

FATHER
Its the same thing Goodbye dear
He now returns the kiss his daughter had given him a short while ago Then
without once turning around he heads slowly towards the entrance of the
house as Claudia comes into the foreground

Anna still very tense and upset over the scene with her father gets into
the car Claudia follows after her as the driver puts her suitcase into the
trunk

CLAUDIA
Have you been waiting long Youll have to
excuse me

Anna doesnt answer She merely pats Claudias hand The car takes off as
Annas maid standing to one side of the road waves a warm goodbye Claudia
responds by waving back but Anna doesnt even look around Instead she
turns to the driver and says

ANNA
Please hurry Alvaro Were late

The car speeds ahead along the dusty road across a verdant strip of land
until it reaches the archway of a stone-wall fence around which it turns and
disappears It is seen again emerging from behind a cement wall and continues
racing swiftly onward over a road that runs between two high walls There is
no sign of traffic Only silence It is an ancient road and a very elegant
one Claudia looks at it admiringly Anna continues to remain wrapped up
within herself The car now makes another turn heading into a small narrow
road flanked on each side by gardens of patrician villas Suddenly it
emerges on a drab modern street amid the kind of traffic typical of any
modern town

Finally the car enters the street where Sandro lives and pulls up in front of
a small but very fashionable palazzo Anna and Claudia get out And as the
driver starts to remove the suitcases from the trunk Claudia turns to Anna
and says

CLAUDIA
Ill wait for you here

Anna starts to walk across the street and is about to enter a building
Surprised Claudia calls out to her

CLAUDIA
But where are you going

ANNA
Im thirsty

CLAUDIA
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour
and whom I hadnt seen for a month

All of a sudden Anna stops She is pensive almost sullen

ANNA
You know I could just as well go without
seeing him today

CLAUDIA
What After giving us such a run around

Claudia stops smiles and jokingly tries to laugh it off

CLAUDIA
I see so its farewell to the yachtand
farewell to the cruise

Anna pays no heed to Claudias teasing comments but follows her own original
line of thought

ANNA

You know its terrible to be far away from one
another Really its difficult to keep an
affair going when one is here and the other is
somewhere else But at the same timeits
comforting Because it gives you a chance to
consider what you want and how you want it
but when hes right there before you all the
time well hes right there

(Then with a sense

of exasperation)
Oh lets go back

Claudia notices Sandro leaning out of the window from his apartment on the
first floor of the building He is looking at them attentively He is a young
man of thirty-five His shirt is unbuttoned and the tie around his neck is
unknotted Realizing that he has been spotted he smiles and waves a cheerful
hello

SANDRO
Ill be right down

As if seized by a sudden powerful impulse Anna heads straight towards the of
the building Claudia looks at her with astonishment and watches her
disappear into the doorway Then she looks up again at the window But Sandro
is no longer there

kk

Sandros apartment is extremely small Although it contains many books it
has the atmosphere of a place that is very seldom lived in Sandro has just
finished knotting his tie He closes his suitcase and heads toward the door
He turns back however to pick up a towel fallen from the bed He takes the
towel into the bathroom Then he goes to the door again opens it and sees
Anna She appears a little anxious Without giving Sandro a chance to say a
word she enters the apartment closing the door behind her Sandro puts down
his suitcase and is about to embrace her but Anna steps aside and begins
staring at him with an intense look upon her face Taking him all in with her
eyes she examines his suit his hands his legs his shoes Then her gaze
moves back up to his face which she proceeds to scrutinize Sandro is unable
to understand her behavior so he shrugs and jokingly exclaims

SANDRO
Would you like to see my profile

He snaps himself into profile then turns slowly in the manner of a store
window mannequin Anna continues to stare at him This time she peers
directly into his eyes Sandro is no longer amused

SANDRO
Well what is it

Finally Anna puts an end to her staring and taking Sandro by the hand she
leads him around the room She stops in front of a mirror and looks at
herself The expression on her face becomes taut determined She starts
unbuttoning her dress as she continues looking at herself in the mirror
Sandro comes up close to her shoulders caresses her hair and whispers
softly into her ear

SANDRO
But your friend is waiting downstairs

ANNA
Shell wait

Anna turns around and presses herself up against him with such a violent
passion that Sandro is somewhat dismayed But only for an instant Soon they
are feverishly kissing each other and it is almost with a sense of sheer
animal pleasure that Sandro abandons himself

kk

Meanwhile left alone Claudia is pacing back and forth outside in front of
the building She is bored and obviously tired of waiting Then as she is
about to cross over to the other side of the street she sees Sandro and Anna
coming out of the doorway The expression on Annas face hasnt changed --
she appears sad and gloomy But Claudia doesnt take note of it she is too
busy fuming over Annas lack of consideration eager to let them both
understand that she is sick and tired of waiting around

As Sandro opens the window of the car which is pointed towards Milan he
says to Claudia

SANDRO
I have a feeling that youre not used to being
alone

CLAUDIA

(glancing first at Sandro
and then at Anna)
That seems to apply to you also

Meanwhile the driver has taken Annas suitcase out of the black car and puts
it into Sandros Claudia picks up her own suitcase and is about to do the
same but Sandro intervenes and takes it from her

SANDRO
Dont be so humble
CLAUDIA

How should I be arrogant
SANDRO
But of course arrogant haughty Hasnt

Anna ever told you

While this exchange was going on Anna has already climbed into Sandros car
Sandro follows and takes his place at the wheel Claudia gets in alongside
him The car takes off at high speed

kk

Heading south along a state highway Sandros car is traveling at high speed
over a straight open road It is twilight and as the evening shadows begin to
fall the surrounding countryside is bathed in an aura of mystery

Inside the car Anna Claudia and Sandro sit in complete silence Anna is
deeply absorbed in her own thoughts Claudia is looking out of the window
enthralled by the dark beauty of the landscape Another car draws up
alongside of Sandros and is about to pass him But Sandro steps on the
accelerator and pulls ahead with a tremendous burst of speed The other car
lags behind and then turns off at a crossroad However Sandro makes no
attempt to slow down In fact spurred on by what has now become a definitely
hostile atmosphere he drives even faster

As Sandro suddenly switches on the headlights the violent glare that
polarizes the roadside cuts off Claudias view She turns to Sandro with a
look of disappointment

CLAUDIA
It was lovelier before

To please her Sandro turns the headlights off and once again the countryside
is covered by a veil of thick but romantic shadows

SANDRO
Like this

Now Claudia again peers out at the landscape -- but only for an instant
Sandro abruptly turns the headlights on again revealing a sharp curve in the
road up ahead only about a hundred yards away He quickly shifts into lower
gear and the car swerves slightly The sudden shift from fourth to third
gear causes the motor to emit a sound that resembles a cry The car races
swiftly towards the curve getting closer and closer But at such high speed
it appears impossible the car will be able to make the turn Further up
ahead where the curve fades there is a stone wall that runs along the side
of the road At this point even Anna is attentive her eyes wide open Both
she and Claudia are petrified and terror-stricken as the curve and the wall
loom closer and closer Fifty yards forty ten All of a sudden the
headlights illuminate a large gap in the wall about three or four yards away
just on the other side of a small ditch that separates the road from the wall
itself There seems to be no other choice With a frightening leap -- and
going well over fifty miles an hour -- the car barely makes it over the ditch
and right through the opening in the wall The car comes to a sudden halt
but skids along on the muddy ground of an empty lot until it finally stops
near the door of a small farmhouse in front of an old man He is seated on a
bench and has been observing the entire scene without budging an inch

There is a brief pause -- silence Then Sandro comes out of the car followed
by Claudia and Anna Claudia is visibly shaken She leans up against the
building for support as though in search of something solid and dependable
She is also unnerved by the feeling that she is responsible for what has just
happened

CLAUDIA
Its all my fault

But instead of reproaching her Sandro turns to the old man and excuses
himself for having broken into his property Imperturbably the old man looks
up at him and says

OLD MAN
And who do you think made that hole over there

Even before he has a chance to be surprised at the old mans remark Sandro
becomes aware that Anna is laughing It is not the hysterical laugh that
normally might be expected after such a close call It is instead a pure and
simple laugh almost a happy one and leaves both Sandro and Claudia plainly
baffled

CLAUDIA
Theres nothing much to laugh at

SANDRO
And thats what I say too We could have all
been killed

Anna looks at them as she continues to laugh

ANNA
Im sorry but I cant help laughing

kk

On a calm sea amid the Aeolian Isles just off the coast of Sicily a motor
yacht is moving quietly and smoothly over the water It is heading directly
towards a small island that appears like a huge rock jutting up from the sea
sharply silhouetted against the sky about a hundred yards away A few sea
gulls are lazily wheeling around up above

Aboard the yacht a sailor is at the helm peacefully smoking his pipe while
another peers out over the water as he munches on a sandwich It is almost
noon

Raimondo a deeply bronzed young man in his thirties is lying outstretched
in the sun on top of the cabin Towards the prow lying flat on her stomach
upon a small rubber mat is Claudia Her arms are dangling over the side of
the boat catching the cool fine spray of water splashing gently against the
prow Corrado comes out of the cabin He sits down on a bench near the stern
after placing a cushion under himself so as not to soil his suit which is
white and of an elegance that is slightly out of style Corrado has a
sensitive face with a look that is both sharp and intelligent In age he is
closer to his fifties than his forties Following directly behind him is
Giulia one of those impossible women who are so terribly sweet and coy and
yet so demanding of attention The pose she strikes as she looks out over the
water and the saccharine tone of voice in which she speaks are precisely
characteristic of her nature

GIULIA
Its as smooth and slick as oil

CORRADO
I detest comparisons made with oil

Anna also appears on deck looks around and noticing Claudia goes over and
lies down beside her Claudia rolls over on her back to embrace all that
wonderful sun but her outstretched arm comes in contact with Anna who smiles
and joins her in a friendly embrace

CLAUDIA
Did you sleep well

ANNA
Yes fairly well But I went to bed last night
planning to do some thinking about a number of
things instead I fell asleep

CLAUDIA
I didnt know one could sleep so well ona
yacht It lulls you

Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by Sandros voice shouting
Hello He comes up to them and gives Anna a warm hug then nods hello to
Claudia He is in a jaunty mood Stretching himself out on the deck he opens
a picture magazine he had brought with him and starts to read But Anna
places her hand over the page he is looking at and says to him

ANNA
It would be better for you to get some sun

Sandro closes the magazine and throws it overboard The pages come apart in
the water Some of them are quickly swept under by the waves while others
float and slowly drift away white specks upon which a few sea gulls converge
emitting their guttural cries

As Sandro stretches himself out in the sun Anna looks upon him with
tenderness She is about to embrace him but stops midway and then finally
changes her mind Instead she proceeds to stare at him with a profoundly
troubled expression Then momentarily dismissing her anxiety she cuddles up
close to him in an effort to provoke his affection Sandro responds but only
with a fleeting kiss Seeing them together like this Claudia gets up and
moves away to the far side of the prow Sandro and Anna remain as they are
until they are suddenly enveloped by a dark shadow Sandro opens his eyes and
sits up Anna does the same The rocky island is now quite close almost
directly upon them It is larger than it previously appeared and casts a
long dark shadow over the yacht The water beneath the overhanging cliffs is
extremely clear and almost motionless Sandro rises to his feet and shouts
out to everybody aboard
SANDRO
Shall we go for a swim

CLAUDIA
Oh no please not here It looks too
dangerous

The yacht proceeds to encircle the island Up ahead another island comes
into view It is smaller brighter and less foreboding Corrado gets up and
comes over to the prow to join Sandro Anna and Claudia He is immediately
followed by Giulia who peers intently at the landscape

GIULIA
At one time the Aeolian isles were all
volcanoes

CORRADO

You must know your third grade geography book
inside out

Giulia looks at him resentfully and abashed Claudia points to an island
which they have just passed

CLAUDIA
What is that one over there called

CORRADO
That must be Basiluzzo

CLAUDIA
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo
basiluzzo

Corrado then points to an even smaller island which they are now approaching

CORRADO
Now that one is Lisca Bianca

Anna who had been absorbed all the while in contemplating the landscape
though still preoccupied with certain personal thoughts of her own suddenly
unfastens her thin dress Stripping down to her bathing suit she turns to
the group and exclaims with a note of exasperation

ANNA
Oh my goodness All that yapping just fora
little swim

She then goes to the edge of the boat which has slowed down somewhat and
before Sandro has a chance to call out to her she dives into the water

SANDRO
Anna

Once in the water Anna starts swimming towards the island The sailor at the
helm slows the boat even more so as to keep it within Annas range Raimondo
meanwhile has gotten his skin-diving equipment ready around his waist he is
tightening a belt to which a long knife is attached The yacht continues to
slow down Sandro now dives into the water and starts swimming towards Anna
Claudia and Giulia are removing their clothes and they too get ready to go
into the water But Claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in
motion so she turns to the sailor and shouts

CLAUDIA
Stop stop the boat

The motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt A sailor places a
ladder over the side of the boat Claudia goes down the ladder easing
herself into the water She moves away from the side of the yacht by swimming
backwards Giulia follows her down the ladder but stops on the last rung

GIULIA
Hows the water

Sandro looks up and pointing to the rocks at the highest part of the island
answers her

SANDRO
Lets see you dive from the top of those rocks
Giulia That would be really sensational Come
on Giulia your life is much too
circumscribed

GIULIA
What has everybody got against me this morning

From inside the cabin a feminine voice is heard shouting

PATRIZIA
Raimondo

Solicitously Raimondo goes over to the door of the cabin from which
Patrizia emerges wrapped in a filmy nightgown She is a woman of great
elegance somewhere in her thirties

PATRIZIA
Why have we stopped

RAIMONDO
(kissing her hand)
Lady Patrizia

Then holding her by the hand Raimondo leads her towards the prow where
Corrado greets her and likewise kisses her hand

CORRADO
Arent you going in for a swim Patrizia

PATRIZIA
What makes you think I would even dream of such
a thing Raimondo why dont you go in for a
dip

She turns around to look at Raimondo and becomes somewhat startled to see him
all rigged out in his diving equipment complete with mask spear-gun etc

PATRIZIA
Raimondo Do you enjoy fishing underwater

RAIMONDO
I detest it But after all what can you do
Its the latestand I try my best to adapt
myself

He dives in As soon as he hits the water he starts shivering and exclaims

RAIMONDO
Who ever said that man was originally a
creature of the sea

Then lowering the mask over his face he begins to submerge On deck
Patrizia peers out over the sea and covering her eyes to shade them from the
sun remarks

PATRIZIA
I have never understood the islands With all
that water around them poor things

kk

Out on the water Sandro and Anna are almost at a standstill keeping
themselves afloat with only the slightest movement of their arms Sandro is
laughing and joking as though all this purely physical enjoyment of sun and
water has freed him of all other cares Anna tries to emulate him but is not
entirely successful Every now and then her face becomes clouded with that
same worried expression

ANNA
When do you have to go back

SANDRO
I dont know It depends on Ettore Hes
now in the process of negotiating for a
contract here in Sicily

ANNA
Then how come youre not with him

SANDRO
What a question Because I want to be with
you naturally I hope he doesnt close the
deal so hell leave me alone at least for a few
days Isnt this water wonderful

He is lying on his back in the water with his eyes closed his face to the
sun cradled in the gentle movement of the waves Anna looks at him then
after a moment of silence she says

ANNA
Id like to find a place where I can get some
peace and rest maybe around here somewhere
Id like to try

SANDRO
What could be more restful than this
(He opens his eyes and
is upright in the water)
Excuse me what is it that you want to try

Instead of answering him Anna starts swimming rapidly out to sea Sandro
tries to hold her back but because she swims much faster he gives up and
finds himself alongside of Giulia

GIULIA
(referring to Anna)
Where is she going

SANDRO
Ask her

Giulia is not much of a swimmer she bobs up and down in the water doing a
crawl and it seems she is always on the verge of going under Still she
manages to stay afloat enjoying herself like a little child Slightly off to
one side Raimondo is exploring the depths with his spear-gun in hand ready
to shoot He seems to be chasing a fish that is apparently trying to elude
him But the water is so clear that it would be difficult even for a fish to
hide In fact only a moment later Raimondo takes aim with his spear-gun
pulls the trigger and the little harpoon shoots out Then with a great
splash he swims off in hasty pursuit of the fish A rubber raft piloted by
one of the crew and bearing Corrado ashore comes passing through the
swimming area The sailor is carrying on a conversation with Corrado

SAILOR
Ive always worked on pleasure boats even
though its more tiring

CORRADO
Why

SAILOR
Because the owners never seem to have any fixed
hours For example last night we kept right on
sailing We didnt even have a chance to get
some sleep Still I like it better

The raft passes alongside of Sandro and Corrado calls out to him

CORRADO
Im going ashore to take a look around the
island There are some ruins up there

SANDRO
There too

CORRADO
Well were still in Italy you know
e raft continues on its way towards shore A little distance away Claudia
s floating on her back basking in the sun with her eyes closed -- almost
otionless Her arms are outstretched and only the very slightest movement of
er fingers in the water is sufficient to keep her afloat Suddenly her hand
omes in contact with something viscous which seems to be a fish that has
ot up to the surface of the water At first Claudia merely withdraws her
and without bothering to see what it is but since it persists in following
er she opens her eyes and notices something moving right next to her
rightened she lets out a tiny yelp At that very moment directly behind

e fish Raimondos rubber fins appear above the water and she realizes

at it is Raimondo himself He removes his mask and breaks out into a hearty
augh as Claudia playfully splashes some water into his face

Poadtmyppoaprsesg

Observing them from a few yards away is Anna Having returned from her swim
out in the open sea she was about to join Claudia But Claudia involved now
in chasing after Raimondo doesnt notice her

Meanwhile Raimondo outdistancing Claudia finds himself alongside of
Sandro

SANDRO
What kind of a fish is that

RAIMONDO
Its a cernia

SANDRO
My God its enormous

Claudia having given up trying to catch Raimondo swims up alongside of
Giulia who is busy observing Corrado disembark on a little strip of beach
that stands out distinctly white against the dark rocks Claudia is in a
playful mood She dives underwater grabs hold of Giulias leg comes up and
then dives under once again Giulia caught up in the spirit of all this
playfulness drops her concern with Corrado and joins in with the fun and
merriment

Suddenly there is a loud shriek then Annas voice is heard screaming

ANNA
A shark A shark

They all turn around to look at her Anna is swimming furiously towards the
boat Then immediately the booming voice of the sailor aboard the yacht
sounds out

SAILOR
Dont move lady Stay where you are
Stop Everybody keep still

But Sandro ignores the warning and starts swimming out towards Anna like a
demon Raimondo who was about to climb aboard the yacht grasps his
spear-gun firmly in his hand hurls himself back into the water and also
starts to swim in Annas direction Claudia is stricken with fear and holds
on tight to Giulia Anna has stopped swimming and is cautiously looking
around to see if anything comes up out of the water Then she looks up and
seeing Sandro and Raimondo approaching she shouts
ANNA
Stay away

They both stop Then Raimondo hurriedly dons his mask and disappears under
water while Sandro again starts swimming out towards Anna Sandro comes up
alongside her

SANDRO
Anna

But Anna doesnt say a word Instead they both swim silently back to the
yacht where Claudia and Giulia are already climbing aboard Patrizia comes
out of the cabin to see what is happening

They all lean over the side of the boat looking down into the water
expecting the shark at any moment to come into view But the water remains
unruffled the seaweed below is clearly visible waving like so many fans
Even the rocks at the bottom can be seen with all sorts of small-gilled fish
darting about A mysterious fascinating world and yet because of what
happened one that arouses fear Everyone aboard is silent Until Anna and
Sandro followed by Raimondo finally arrive and climb aboard Sandro
immediately takes Anna to her cabin and the others follow making various
comments

CLAUDIA
(to Anna)
But how did you become aware of it Did it
touch you

Anna doesnt answer but continues on ahead amid the overlapping remarks

GIULIA
I would have died

PATRIZIA
» and how ugly they are with all those teeth

CORRADO
(shouting from the shore)
What happened

GIULIA
(shouting from the prow)
Theres a shark in the area Dont move from
where you are

CORRADO
Whos moving

kk

Inside the cabin which is partitioned into separate rooms the general
layout is neat and orderly with a number of prints decorating the walls
Sandro and Anna followed by Claudia enter from the outside deck and cross
over into Annas room It is extremely small with two cots on one side anda
long curtain that partially conceals a bureau from which several dresses are
seen hanging

Anna is soaking wet in her bathing suit and her hair is all knotted into
clusters that hang down over her face Without bothering to dry herself she
crouches down on the cot and assisted by Claudia wraps a blanket around her
body Sandro and Claudia look at her with great concern A member of the crew
enters carrying a tray on which there is a half-filled glass of liquor which
Sandro takes and offers to Anna

SANDRO
Here drink some cognac

Anna positively refuses it and the sailor leaves as Sandro sets the glass
down on a shelf Looking up at both Sandro and Claudia Anna appears pleased
with their solicitude

ANNA
Its nothing really Lets go back Its
all over now

A pause and then an instant later she begins shivering under the blanket

ANNA
Only Id like to change Im a little cold

Leaving Anna and Claudia alone on their own Sandro turns and goes outside
the cabin where the others are still congregated busy chattering Among the
remarks exchanged one that is distinctly heard is Patrizias

PATRIZIA
But where did the shark go to

As soon as Sandro closes the door to the cabin Anna is suddenly and
completely changed She gets up from the cot goes over to the curtain and
draws it aside revealing an array of feminine attire Wondering which dress
to choose she finally selects two and tosses them on the cot

ANNA
Which one shall I wear

CLAUDIA
(picking up one of the two dresses)
This one is gorgeous

ANNA
Then why dont you try it on

As Anna begins to dry herself with a large bath towel Claudia slips on the
dress and looks at herself in the mirror with a coquettish expression on her
face

ANNA
It looks better on you than it does on me
You keep it

Anna is removing her bathing suit as she continues talking to Claudia with a
tone and manner that reveal a sense of excitement mixed with one of
amusement

ANNA
You know that thing about the shark was alla
joke

Claudia looks at her as though dumbfounded as though she had never known her
before She is obviously piqued and angry but more with herself than with
Anna

CLAUDIA
Theres the difference between you and me you
know how to put over certain things and I
dont Sometimes I envy you

Anna is all dressed and ready She opens the door and steps outside as
Claudia follows behind

kk

Out on the deck Sandro Patrizia Raimondo and Giulia are looking over the
side of the boat watching the sailor as he approaches the yacht with a
rubberized raft Giulia with her usual air of affectation looks down at
the water splashing up against the raft and asks the sailor

GIULIA
But arent you afraid

SAILOR
Matam sharks never attack anybody Anyway the
raft is dark and they wouldnt be able to see
it

PATRIZIA
So it is true that theyre blind

Anna appears at the door of the cabin and Sandro rushes over to meet her a
little surprised to find her looking so cheerful as though the incident that
had just taken place were completely forgotten

SANDRO
How are you

ANNA
Fine Cant you see so yourself

Anna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little
stairway leading down to the water

ANNA

I have an urge to put my feet on some land
Arent you coming

As she starts to go down the steps Sandro quickly comes over to her
SANDRO
Anna Maybe it would be better to wait a
while

ANNA
Wait for what

PATRIZIA
Well with a shark running loose around the
place I for one wont get aboard that raft
Theyll have to catch it first I want to see
it right here before my feet dead or alive

CLAUDIA
Better dead

But Anna has already stepped aboard the raft and Sandro follows her Giulia
has her eyes fixed on the beach where Corrado in his white suit is waiting
for them Her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark so
she looks down at the sailor and asks

GIULIA
Will the three of us fit

SAILOR
Sure sure Theres plenty of room

Patrizia instead turns around and heads back to the cabin And Raimondo
follows her shortly after Giulia descends into the raft and as it moves
away from the boat with a slight pitch she lets out a few hysterical
shrieks

Anna laughs and then shouts out to Claudia

ANNA
Claudia arent you coming

CLAUDIA
Im certainly not going to swim across

ANNA
Well send the raft back to you

GIULIA
And bring some cushions when you come and a
towel

Claudia nods assent and remains there looking over the side and watching the
water splash against the boat Suddenly she looks up at the sky and realizes
that the sun has disappeared Actually it is hidden behind a cloud and over
on the horizon a group of other clouds have accumulated

The sailor left aboard the yacht is now signaling the other sailor on the
raft who having deposited Sandro Anna and Giulia on the beach is returning
to pick up Claudia He sounds the depths with his oar and then shouts up

SAILOR
Okay Come ahead come ahead
The sailor aboard the yacht goes over to Claudia and says

SAILOR
Im taking the boat right up to the shore and
well let you get off from the gangplank as
soon as we get there

Then he disappears inside and soon the yacht starts moving towards the shore
Claudia peers out over the landscape the islands are sharply silhouetted
against the sea and sky the volcano on Stromboli smokes feebly and in the
distance a ship passes by Claudia is plainly enchanted by the view Then she
collects her thoughts and slowly heads towards the cabin

kk

Patrizia seated at a small table inside the cabin is busy working on a
complicated jigsaw puzzle which once completed is supposed to represent a
typically classical scene One by one she selects the various pieces of
cardboard and inserts them in their rightful places Simultaneously she is
munching on some crackers spread with jam and a piece of cold fruit Beside
her is Raimondo He is staring at Patrizia with such an intense expression
that she becomes thoroughly annoyed and says to him as she continues working
at her puzzle

PATRIZIA
What do you want Raimondo Do you want me A
few years ago maybe but now And then

at this hour of the day

Coming down the steps that lead into the cabin Claudia overhears the end of
the conversation and decides to withdraw But Patrizia sees her and calls
her back

PATRIZIA
Come Claudia do come in Theres no
romance going on here

Claudia enters Raimondo continues to stare at Patrizia particularly at her
legs Patrizia becomes aware that Raimondo is staring at her and with a
condescending gesture she lifts her skirt a little higher to make him see
better

PATRIZIA
There have you seen enough now Are you
satisfied

Raimondo nods yes Claudia is amused by their behavior but also a little
surprised

Patrizia calmly resumes her game and Raimondo again begins to stare at her
This time at her breasts And again Patrizia becomes conscious of the fact
that he is staring at her She assumes a bored attitude and looks up at the
ceiling in a gesture of quiet forbearance Raimondo reaches out with his hand
and gently caresses Patrizias breast Claudia looks on in amazement
Raimondo withdraws his hand
PATRIZIA
(regretfully)
Now tell the truth arent you a bit
disappointed But I already told you

RAIMONDO

If womens breasts were colored yours would be
blue

Patrizia laughs at Raimondos remark and looks at him sympathetically Then
she turns to Claudia

PATRIZIA
Tell me Claudia what do you think of Raimondo

CLAUDIA
I would say hes pretty depraved

PATRIZIA
Oh no quite the contrary Hes really just a
child

RAIMONDO
Patrizia dont start in again I would

rather be called depraved Unless you happen to
love children

PATRIZIA
You know I dont love anybody

RAIMONDO
(angrily)
I know dammit I know
(turning to Claudia)
And just think -- if there ever was a woman so
right so perfectly cut out for all kinds of
dissipations degradations infidelities

of of of debaucheries its her Well
anyway shes faithful Faithful out of
laziness of unwillingness

Raimondo has such a disgruntled look on his face that Patrizia laughs

PATRIZIA
He amuses me I dont know of anything more
amusing Outside of this jigsaw puzzle Dont
you find it so Claudia

CLAUDIA
One would have to be in love with somebody to
know that

PATRIZIA

Have you ever been in love

CLAUDIA
Not really Its suffocating in here Shall
we go out

Claudia leaves the cabin and goes up to the deck Patrizia returns to her
game and Raimondo continues to stare at her

kk

Along a narrow strip of beach on the island of Lisca Bianca Sandro Anna
Corrado and Giulia are waiting for Claudia to come ashore There are some
patches of vegetation growing here and there but by and large the island is
one huge rock with rugged cliffs which descend perpendicularly to the water
Jutting promontories give the place a sense of raw primitive beauty Seeing
Anna and Sandro climbing a short distance up along the rocks to find a
comfortable place where they can lie down and stretch themselves Corrado
remarks

CORRADO
If any of you get into your bathing suits
again you can be sure we wont be seeing one
another for the rest of the year I just cant
stand seeing anybody in the city after having
seen them naked on the beach

The yacht finally has arrived and the gangplank is laid out between the boat
and the shore Claudia descends and as she wades ashore she stops bends over
to dip her hand in the water and with a tone of voice resembling that of a
mother speaking to its newborn child she pretends she is speaking with
someone or something in the water

CLAUDIA
Oh how sweet What a dear little darling

They all turn around to look at her wondering to whom or what she is
referring

GIULIA
Who are you talking to

CLAUDIA
To the shark

They all break out into a laugh and Claudia continues her comic bit as she
playfully pretends to lose her balance on the slippery pebbles along the
shore Corrado looks at her somewhat surprised as though up until now he had
never seen her comport herself with such a lively sense of humor and wit

CORRADO
Say Claudia wouldnt you like to climb up
with me and take a look over there

CLAUDIA
At what

CORRADO
At the ruins Theyre very ancient you know
Out of the entire group Claudia is perhaps the only one who really has the
desire to explore to see and to generally take advantage of whatever the
cruise has to offer

CLAUDIA
That sounds like a good idea But why dont we
all go together

Though Claudias suggestion is heard by all none of them make a move
Relaxing so comfortably in the sun as they are it seems the last thing they
would want to do is to climb up the rocky slopes So Claudia starts to go up
on her own following Corrado who is already under way But Giulia
immediately comes up to him and squeezing his arm to emphasize her plea
whispers to him

GIULIA
Please I beg of you stay here

Giulias plea is expressed with such a pitiful sense of humility that Claudia
is immediately taken aback although she does not fully understand its
motive

CORRADO
(noticing Claudias hesitancy)
Well
CLAUDIA
Well what
CORRADO

Have you decided

CLAUDIA
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea

Disappointed and rather irritated Corrado turns back while Claudia looks
around for a place on the rocks where she can comfortably set herself down
Giulia in turn approaches Corrado

GIULIA
Why didnt you ask me to go with you

CORRADO
Do you know why Because if you saw those ruins
Im sure you would have said they were very
very beautiful You always say how beautiful
to everything -- whether its the sea or a
baby or a cat You have such a sensitive
little heart that it throbs for anything

CORRADO
(ironically)
But Corrado If something is beautiful why

shouldnt one say so

GIULIA
(referring to Corrado)
He never misses a chance to humiliate me to
let me know that he doesnt care about me any
more

CORRADO
Giulia that remark is not worthy of our twelve
years of honest concubinage I repeat once and
for all and publicly that I admire you Does
that please you

CLAUDIA
(under her breath to
Anna and Sandro)
Twelve years But why havent they married

SANDRO
(with a faint smile)
And why havent they left each other

CLAUDIA
Im beginning to have my doubts It couldnt be
that theyre in love

SANDRO
Could be Theyre the kind of people who are
capable of anything

Sandro suddenly grabs Anna around the waist and pulls her to him His action
is so unexpected that even Anna is astonished But Giulias voice is heard
again

GIULIA
(to Corrado)
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak
to you thats all

SANDRO
(placatingly)
Giulia dont you understand that the more
involved you become with people the more
difficult it is to speak with them

GIULIA
You men are all so dreadful

SANDRO
I know we are But as the years go by we
become even worse Isnt that so Corrado

CORRADO
I hope so

Breaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group a
seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht
Claudia runs to the basket picks up a peach and quickly bites into it
CLAUDIA
How wonderful

CORRADO
Thats Patrizias way of letting us know shes
with us

Claudia takes another peach from the basket and gives it to Corrado

CLAUDIA
I think youre very sweet Corrado

CORRADO
More so than the shark

CLAUDIA
Theres no comparison

CORRADO
Then why dont we go up and see the ruins

kk

Anna and Sandro have left the group and are ensconced further up among the
rocks on a grassy slope overlooking the beach

ANNA
Sandro A month is too long a time I have
become used to being without you

SANDRO
Youll get over it soon Its the usual anxiety

ANNA
A little more so this time

SANDRO
So it will just take you a little longer to
get over it

ANNA
(angrily)
But I think we should talk about it Or are you
fully convinced that we too wont understand
each other

SANDRO
There will be plenty of time to talk about it
later Well get married soon That way
well have more time

ANNA
In this case getting married means nothing
Arent we already the same as being married
And Corrado and Giulia -- arent they already
the same as being married
SANDRO
But why rattle your brains by arguing and
talking Believe me Anna words never help
at all They only serve to confuse I love you
Anna Isnt I that enough

ANNA
No Its not enough I told you before that I
would like to get away for a while and be alone

SANDRO
But you just said that a month was too

ANNA
(interrupting)

I mean to stay away longer -- two months a
year three years Yes I know it sounds
absurd And I feel awful The very idea of
losing you makes me want to die And yet
I I just dont have the same feeling for you
any more

SANDRO
And what about yesterday at my house

didnt you have any feeling for me even then

ANNA
(angrily)
There you go Must you always spoil
everything

She turns and walks away in a rage Sandro breathes a deep sigh

the scene had exhausted him

turned skyward his eyes shut tight

kk

as though

then stretches himself on the ground his face

The sky over the island of Lisca Bianca is completely filled with clouds It
is early afternoon the atmosphere has darkened and occasional sounds of
thunder are heard in the distance

Sandro is asleep with his arms folded under his head Further below Claudia
Corrado and Giulia are also taking a nap Gradually however with the sound

of thunder

Corrado rises and looks around lazily

they become aroused

GIULIA
Looks like the weather is changing

CORRADO
Please Giulia must you always emphasize the
obvious I can see for myself that the weather
is changing

listening to what appears to be the

sound of a motor boat and which seems to be coming from the other side of the
island Claudia spotting a sailor approaching also rises

SAILOR
Well have to get going

Claudia turns around looks up and sees Sandro asleep by himself

CLAUDIA
And wheres Anna
(then turning to the sailor)
Isnt she on the yacht

SAILOR
I dont know you see we were taking a
little nap

kk

Out on the yacht Patrizia is completing her puzzle Only a few pieces are
missing but the area to be filled in is a very difficult one Raimondo who
has grown impatient over Patrizias long and tedious concentration exclaims

RAIMONDO
Youve made some mistake there with the
bushes thats why you cant finish it
PATRIZIA
Take it easy Raimondo Why are you getting so

impatient
Claudias voice is heard calling out from the shore

CLAUDIA
Patrizia

Patrizia raises her eyes and gives a quick casual glance at the porthole
Raimondo immediately takes the hint that she would like him to get up and see
what Claudia wants So he goes out to the deck where he sees Claudia calling
from the shore

CLAUDIA
Is Anna there

RAIMONDO
I dont think so

He goes over to the cabin and looking through the portholes calls out
Annas name But there is no answer so he returns to the side of the boat
and shouts back

RAIMONDO
Shes not here
kk

Meanwhile on the beach Sandro is also looking for Anna disturbed and
amazed that she is not in sight

SANDRO
(angrily to himself)
This is the kind of behavior that drives me
crazy

Down at the shore Giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go
aboard the yacht but anxious about Annas whereabouts she changes her mind
and turns back Claudia also deeply concerned decides to remain and look
around for herself She turns and starts climbing up towards the rock in an
opposite direction than that taken by Sandro who has now reached the top

The search is fruitless there seems to be no trace of Anna But Sandro
continues to explore the area stopping every now and then to call out Annas
name Then looking down over the slope he notices Claudia Giulia and
Corrado coming towards him

SANDRO
Did you find her

None of them answer but it is clear from the worried expressions on their
faces that they too have found no trace of Anna Still they continue the
search each going off in different directions Claudia walking over land
covered with large white rocks and clumps of dry brush spots something
moving behind one of the bushes Anxiously she starts to walk up closer
Suddenly the branches begin to move and a stray lamb emerges Surprised but
also somewhat relaxed she turns around and calls out to Corrado who is
following her only a short distance away

CLAUDIA
Its a lamb

Corrado looks at her without answering then stops and notices further up
ahead a jumbled pile of rocks which he feels might very well be the ruins he
had previously intended to explore He is about to head towards them but
suddenly realizes that Giulia is following directly behind him He quickly
changes his direction in an effort to avoid her

Sandro comes upon a small stone hut that leans up against a high section of
rock As he starts to approach it another stray lamb appears as if from
nowhere and runs off frightened by Sandros approach He tries to open the
door to the hut but finds it locked As he looks around the area uncertain
as to his next move he sees Claudia and Corrado coming towards him

CLAUDIA
Find anything

SANDRO
No

CORRADO

Perhaps shes taking a swim somewhere

Though no less concerned over Annas disappearance than any of the others
Corrado attempts to lighten the tension by feigning a calm and sensible
attitude Taking note of the stone hut before him he observes it carefully
and remarks

CORRADO
Its really a fact -- theres nothing new under
the sun Now look here Look at this
structure a kind of natural shelter Sandro

thats how you should design your houses

SANDRO
Me I no longer have any interest in
building And then where can you find

boulders of rock like this in Milan

Claudia comes up close to the hut and tries to peer through the tiny window
but inside it is so dark that nothing can be seen Suddenly she finds a
small piece of bread on the ledge of the window She picks it up and starts
examining it Then realizing the bread is still fairly fresh exclaims

CLAUDIA
Somebody must live here

CORRADO
(after examining the bread himself)
But Anna wouldnt be staying with the kind of
people who live here

The discussion is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of one of the sailors
who has come up from the shore

SAILOR
We had better get started The storm may
break any minute now

CLAUDIA
(angrily)
What do you mean What about Anna

SANDRO
(to the seaman)
Tell Lady Patrizia that we cant leave now In
fact well have to make a tour around the
island

SAILOR
Wouldnt it be better if you told that to the
Lady yourself I cant assume the
responsibility for keeping the boat here
Theres no place to tie it up And then
you know its got a flat bottom and if the
sea gets a little too rough

SANDRO
(angrily)
That doesnt make any difference If we have to
stay well stay
kk

Aboard the yacht which is circling the island Sandro Patrizia Raimondo
and one of the sailors are peering out over the side scrutinizing the banks
and rocky slopes in hope of finding some trace of Anna The jagged cliffs
appear enormously tall and ominous harboring tiny grottoes in which someone
could easily hide

PATRIZIA
Perhaps she wasnt feeling well Maybe a
cramp or something

SANDRO
Anna is an excellent swimmer Even with a
cramp she would have managed to reach shore

somehow

PATRIZIA
But you have to consider all possibilities
Sandro

Incensed by her remark which he considers to be absurd Sandro moves away
from Patrizia and goes towards the stern of the boat where he notices Corrado
signaling to them from a remote section of the beach

CORRADO
(calling out)
There are some footprints around here

But he stops in the middle of the statement and throws up his arms to
indicate that the discovery is really of little significance So he proceeds
to climb back up along the pathway from which he descended and the yacht
continues on its way

SANDRO
(calling from the stern excitedly)
Patrizia

Both Patrizia and Raimondo come rushing over to the stern and look towards
where Sandro is pointing at something dark and obscure afloat on the water up
ahead

RAIMONDO
(to the sailor)
MarioSteer the boat that way

The yacht heads in the direction of the black object in the water but as
they come up close they realize it is nothing more than some wooden piece of
furniture The turn has taken the boat slightly away from Lisca Bianca and
they now find themselves closer to the little island of Basiluzzo

SAILOR
Shall I turn back

SANDRO
No Now that were here lets have a look
around Basiluzzo

(then turning to Patrizia)
When we were swimming she swam out in that
direction

SAILOR
It wont be easy to find a place to go ashore

kk

The first shadows of evening begin to fall over the island of Lisca Bianca
The sky is now even gloomier streaked with flashes of lightning Rumbling
sounds of thunder are heard in the distance The entire group is once again
reunited on the beach and the impending storm has heightened their fears and
anxiety They are cold restless and exhausted but profoundly moved and
shaken by the reality of Annas strange disappearance

SANDRO
Lets try to be practical about this The best
thing to do is for all of you to go to the
closest island that has a police station or
something and report the disappearance Ill
remain here because well I dont know
but it seems to me that something may turn up
Anyway I just dont feel like leaving

CORRADO
Then lets get started Its senseless to
waste any more time

PATRIZIA
(to the sailor)
How long will it take to go there and come
back

SAILOR
If theres a police station at Panarea it
should take us a couple of hours But if we
have to go to Lipari it will take much longer
Then it also depends on how rough the sea is

Giulia is about to get on her way but she stops and turns around to look for
Corrado who notices her looking at him

CORRADO
Ill stay here also

GIULIA
(alarmed)
But why What if it starts to rain

CORRADO
If it rains Ill buy myself an umbrella

Claudia who has remained to one side wrapped up in her own thoughts
doesnt make a move to leave Sandro and Corrado look at her in surprise

CORRADO
(to Claudia understandingly)
Claudia I know how you feel but there are
already two of us staying

SANDRO
Ill go even further and say that her presence
here -- I dont want to sound offensive -- could

be a great hindrance

Ignoring Sandros remark Claudia turns and determinedly heads towards the
interior of the island Meanwhile Patrizia and Giulia have gone aboard the
yacht

GIULIA
(calling to Corrado
from the boat)
Do you want some blankets and something
to eat

Corrado makes an irritated gesture signifying no then together with Sandro
starts climbing up the rocky slope towards the stone hut As they meet up
with Claudia midway the first drops of rain start to fall and it is clear
that the storm is on the verge of breaking The three of them reach the door
of the hut and Corrado tries to pull it open but the lock resists Then
Sandro comes to his aid and placing their shoulders up against the wooden
door they finally manage to force it open

kk

Inside the hut it is pitch black Sandro strikes a match and finds a kerosene
lamp on a nearby table He lights it and the room is suddenly illuminated
revealing a miserable interior with a few broken chairs several empty boxes
a shovel and a few other utensils Over to one side is a small pile of straw
suggesting a makeshift bed

CLAUDIA
As far as Im concerned I think shes alive
Why even this morning that business about
the shark it wasnt at all true

SANDRO

And why do you tell us this only now

CLAUDIA
I I dont know I didnt think it was
worthwhile She was laughing over it
CORRADO

Really Still it remains to be seen why she
invented a shark What was her purpose in that

CLAUDIA
(indicating Sandro)
Maybe youd better ask him
CORRADO
(to Sandro)

What were you and Anna arguing about
Excuse me for being so indiscreet but this is

serious

SANDRO
Nothing but the usual argument The only
thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that

she said she had a need to be alone

CLAUDIA
And how do you explain that

Ignoring the question Sandro begins pacing

back and forth across the room

The silence is broken only by the sound of the rain outside which is now
coming down harder and harder Suddenly footsteps are heard approaching the
hut Sandro Claudia and Corrado quickly turn around and face the door their
faces clearly revealing the expectation that it might be Anna Finally the

door begins to open and an old man appears

SANDRO

carrying a sack in his hand

Are you the owner of this place

OLD MAN

No The owners are in Australia

SANDRO
But where did you come from

OLD MAN
From Panarea Why

CORRADO

Ah then it was you I heard a boat leaving

here at two oclock today

OLD MAN
(scratching his head)

It must have been around four or five

CORRADO
In the afternoon

OLD MAN

No in the morning Why Whats happened
SANDRO

Nothing nothing at all
CLAUDIA

But why dont you tell him

(then turning to the old man)
A girl who was with us has disappeared

OLD MAN
What do you mean disappeared Was she
drowned

CLAUDIA
No she didnt drown She just disappeared
and nobody knows where

SANDRO
And I suppose its my fault Why dont you
tell him that too Thats what you believe
isnt it

CLAUDIA

Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts
you would have been better off trying to
understand what Anna was thinking

OLD MAN

Have you searched in back of the house to see
if she might have fallen off that cliff Last
month thats what happened to one of my
sheep I looked all over for it all day long
and it wasnt until late at night that I heard
it bleating It had been there the whole
day and was almost dead

Claudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark calling
out desperately

CLAUDIA
Anna Anna

But her cries are lost in the sound of the storm Drenched by the rain her
shoes full of mud her dress soaked she stops as Corrado who had followed
after her grabs hold of her arm and leads her back to the hut

CORRADO
Come Claudiacome back inside

kk

It is early morning inside the hut and the flame of the kerosene lamp has
dwindled down to a tiny flickering light Claudia awakens with a bewildered
look upon her face wondering where she is and how she comes to be there She
notices Corrado dozing on an empty box in a corner of the room then
realizing that Sandro and the old man are no longer there she gets up and
goes out the door

Outside everything is covered by a thick haze which is gradually beginning
to lift Sandro who is standing a short distance away from the hut hears

Claudia approaching and turns around to greet her

SANDRO
Are you feeling better

CLAUDIA
(nodding yes)
Im sorry about last night Please forgive me

SANDRO
Youre very fond of Anna arent you

CLAUDIA
Yes very much so

SANDRO
Has she ever spoken to you about me

CLAUDIA
Occasionally but always with affection

SANDRO
And yet she seemed to feel that our love for
her -- mine yours even her fathers ina
certain sense -- werent enough for her or
didnt mean much to her

CLAUDIA
I know I keep asking myself what I could have
done to prevent all this from happening

There is a pause then suddenly they both hear the sound of a motor growing
louder and louder They look out over the shore but the haze is so heavy that
it is impossible for them to determine the source Then seeing the old man
coming up the path Sandro impulsively runs towards him and seizes him by the
collar

SANDRO
Whose boat is that

OLD MAN
(astonished)

What boat

SANDRO
Just a moment ago didnt you hear the sound
of a motor

OLD MAN
At this time of the year there are so many
boats

SANDRO

And how come youre up so early

OLD MAN
Early Is four in the morning early for you

Sandro is visibly deflated by the old mans casualness and he decides to
abandon his questioning He turns away from him and looks up to see Claudia
walking slowly towards the top of the cliffs directly behind the hut where
the night before the old man had said Anna might have fallen She looks down
over the side and quickly withdraws almost in fear of being sucked down into
the swirling waters below She turns away and starts walking towards the
interior part of the island In the rocky hollows around her she notices
small accumulations of yesterdays rain and scooping up some of the water
from one of these rocks she rinses her face As she gets up again Sandro is
there standing directly before her Claudia is almost startled They
continue to gaze at one another in silence Then Claudia abruptly turns away
and heads towards a higher point of land A moment later Sandro joins her
again and once more they find themselves staring into each others eyes
almost embarrassed by their own behavior yet unable to control it

The wailing siren of a police boat resounds through the air like a shrill
lament Only then do Sandro and Claudia detach themselves from their trance-
like state from the sudden compulsion of being drawn towards each other
Through the haze they notice a landing taking place down at the shore
Realizing it is their friends returning with the police they both start
descending the slope to greet them

Stepping ashore are Patrizia Giulia and Raimondo followed by a Marshal of
the carabinieri and two police agents As Sandro and Claudia come rushing
down over the rocks Claudia suddenly stops and lags behind so as not to
arrive on the beach simultaneously with Sandro

Meanwhile Corrado has already gone down to the shore and as he goes out to
meet them Patrizia Giulia and Raimondo anxiously look to him as though
expecting some good news But Corrado remains silent then throws out his
arms in a gesture of despair

GIULIA
How did you spend the night In that hut
And what did you have to eat

CORRADO
What do you think

GIULIA
We too you know It was disastrous First at
Panarea where there werent any boats then
at Lipari where everybody was asleep And

the phone call to Rome

PATRIZIA
We had to notify her father

CORRADO
Yes that was a very good idea

PATRIZIA
Hell be here sometime today
(then turning to Sandro who
has just arrived on the scene)
I also phoned my house in Milan but Ettore
had already left

MARSHAL
(to Sandro)
Anything new develop
SANDRO
Unfortunately no

MARSHAL
Very well First of all Ill have them search
the waters around the island I brought two
frogmen with me Meanwhile well take a look
up around here

SANDRO
Look Marshal with those deep crevasses
youll need some rope and ladders

MARSHAL
Dont worry weve got everything

SANDRO
Another thing theres an old man who lives
here on the island

MARSHAL
(interrupting)
I know I know One thing at a time

The Marshal starts climbing up towards the interior of the island with
Sandro following behind As Claudia sees them coming in her direction she
moves away to a lower section of the island to avoid coming in contact with
Sandro Peering over a precipice she sees the frogmen below and watches
them slide into the clear water like two enormous fish

Sandro and the Marshal have arrived on the edge of the same precipice where
two men are lowering a rope ladder into the depths Moving up further to
watch the operations Sandro becomes aware of Claudia standing alone just a
short distance away He heads towards her but she tries to avoid looking at
him Sandro however is unable to take his eyes from her and continues
walking in her direction But seeing Patrizia and Raimondo approaching he
suddenly stops A small stone accidentally loosened from the ground rolls
along the path and comes to a halt directly in front of Claudia almost like
a message She picks it up looks at it then throws it away Sandro moves
away and heads back to the edge of the precipice

Patrizia and Raimondo join Claudia Raimondo who is carrying a box of
crackers in his hand offers them to both Claudia and Patrizia

PATRIZIA
No who wants crackers Why dont you go and
have some coffee made instead

Meanwhile Sandro has arrived at the edge of the precipice where he finds
Giulia and Corrado They are looking down at one of the carabinieri who is
dangling from a long rope over the side of the rock exploring the crevasses
where a body might have fallen from the precipice above The Marshal leans
over to see if anything has been discovered

CARABINIERE
(calling up to the Marshal)
Nothing here
The Marshal turns around in disgust and looks at Corrado who is frankly sick
and tired of the whole operation

CORRADO
Dont look at me like that Marshal I had
nothing to do with it

PATRIZIA
(referring to the frogmen below)
Lets hope they dont find her If they do

they would find her dead

All of a sudden Claudia breaks out into tears Patrizia doesnt say a word
She just lets Claudia cry knowing it will do her good Sandro comes over and
as soon as Claudia sees him there she stops crying and avoids looking up at
him

SANDRO
Listen Patrizia The Marshal says theres a
current that passes by here and ends up at
another island I dont know which He
wants to send one of his men over to have a
look One never knows Do you mind if I ask
Raimondo to go with him

PATRIZIA
I dont see why I should mind

CLAUDIA
(to Sandro)
I think that you might go and have a look
yourself

SANDRO
Yes maybe that is better

He turns and starts heading down towards the beach

PATRIZIA
(to Claudia)
What amazes me is Sandro He seems so calm

CLAUDIA
(rising)
Calm He doesnt seem so to me He was
awake all night

One of the frogmen emerges with an ancient vase in his hand evidently found
in the depths below Raimondo who has just arrived with a thermos of hot
coffee puts it down and goes over to the frogman to fetch the vase

RAIMONDO
(to the frogman)
What is it

FROGMAN
An ancient vase Theres a buried city under
here Its full of this stuff

Raimondo takes the vase and shows it to Patrizia and Claudia It is an
extremely beautiful amphora in terra cotta with a figured design around it
Patrizia and Claudia momentarily drop their thoughts to examine it Then
Corrado who had observed the scene comes over followed immediately by
Giulia

PATRIZIA
(ironically)
Come on Corrado tell us what century it
belongs to

Corrado smiles then comes closer to examine it Claudia also kneels down to
look at it A moment later she feels a presence at her side and even without
turning around she knows it is Sandro Taking advantage of the discovery that
was made he purposely has returned to join the group in order to be near
Claudia They both now feel between them the warmth of that contact and for
a brief moment succumb once again to that sudden sense of wonderment which
they already had experienced at dawn

GIULIA
Corrado why dont you ask them to give it to
us as a gift

CORRADO
Really So that you can stuff it with your
geraniums

PATRIZIA

(to Sandro)
But arent you supposed to be on your way

Claudia stricken with dismay immediately detaches herself from Sandro who
replies with a certain sense of embarrassment

SANDRO
Yes Im going Im going now

kk

A patrol boat is anchored off the cliff of a small island where the current
running through the surrounding waters comes to an end Sandro is leaning
against the wall of a dilapidated building which is constructed right on
that part of the rock where the sea close by discharges all kinds of refuse
Four or five islanders are busy scouring through the accumulated rubbish
They are taciturn poorly dressed people who every now and then come to blows
over the possession of some article washed ashore by the waves Sandro is
watching them feeling distraught and melancholy One of the carabinieri who
had accompanied him is walking up and down beside an elderly gentleman who is
obviously one of the local gentry

SANDRO
(to the carabiniere)
Its already two hours What are we going to
do

CARABINIERE
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for
the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca

ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
And sometimes even twenty-four depending on
the wind

CARABINIERE
If the girl disappeared yesterday afternoon
well have to wait at least until three or four
oclock

Sandro looks at them without commenting then turns and walks away towards
the center of the village The houses and shops around the square are very
plain and shabby Sandro spots a barber shop and fingering his day-old
beard enters for a shave

Shortly thereafter a clamor of voices is heard outside and Sandro comes
dashing out of the shop Seeing the islanders fighting and arguing about
something drawn up from the sea he runs over to find out what it is As he
arrives on the scene two policemen step out of the confusion dragging a
large crate which they carry over to the door of a nearby shack amid the
protests of the islanders who are still arguing and shouting among
themselves

VOICES

It belongs to me We found it
GENTLEMAN

Back Stand back

The two policemen set the crate down and lift the lid It is full of
cigarettes

CARABINIERE
(to the islanders)
You see It contains cigarettes Well have to
confiscate it

The islanders react violently shouting out all sorts of epithets But the
policemen manage to restrain them and soon the commotion is quieted down

CARABINIERE
(to Sandro)
These people are contemptible They have no
sense of dignity at all

SANDRO
(referring to the crate)
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca

CARABINIERE
It couldnt have come from anywhere else At
least somewhere from that vicinity But I
really cant understand it Contraband
cigarettes on that island Its the first time
that ever happened

SANDRO
Look Id like to get back to Lisca Bianca
CARABINIERE
But how could weat a time like this when we
just well lets at least first have a look

around the other islands Could be that
something might turn up there

SANDRO
(impatiently)
But even here we were supposed to find who
knows what And all we bring back with us is
a crate of cigarettes

CARABINIERE
(shrugging his shoulders
As you wish

kk

At Lisca Bianca a helicopter is hovering above the island and preparing to
land Waiting for it to descend are Claudia the old man the Marshal and
Annas father just arrived from the mainland

MARSHAL
(to the old man)
Is it also true that you saw no boat around
here at Lisca between yesterday and this
morning

OLD MAN
How many times do I have to tell you Marshal
that I was at Panarea

MARSHAL
I believe you I believe you But Im also
certain that youre hiding something from me I
can see it written all over your face And
you know that I have never liked your face And
if you want to know something that gentleman
over there

(indicating Annas father)

-whos a very important person doesnt
like it either So just keep that in mind
Tll talk to you later

The Marshal moves away from the old man and goes over towards Annas father
who is watching the helicopter come down

ANNAS FATHER
I presume by this method that youll be able to
uncover some new clue either a handkerchief or
an article of clothing In other words
something which your men have not been able to
find as yet

MARSHAL
Without any doubt sir If anything belonging
to the girl who has run away is still here on
this island

ANNAS FATHER
(resentfully)
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not
a fugitive

MARSHAL
Im sorry sir I didnt mean to put it that
way But you must understand sir that I

ANNAS FATHER
I understand very well Only I dont want any
rash assumptions to be made

One of the carabinieri appears with Annas valise which he sets down on the
ground

MARSHAL
Heres her valise sir

The helicopter is now a few feet above the ground and everyone steps aside
to allow it room to land The rush of wind from the propeller sends up a
cloud of dust and finally the helicopter touches down The propeller stops
the door opens and out comes two large bloodhounds accompanied by a police
attendant He immediately says something to the dogs in German which suddenly
creates an atmosphere of resentment among the group assembled there

Annas father goes to his daughters valise bends down but doesnt dare to
touch it

CLAUDIA
Do you want me to open it

ANNAS FATHER
Yes please

Claudia opens the valise and starts pulling out several dresses a few
intimate garments and several other items of clothing As she continues
rummaging she suddenly comes upon two books Fitzgeralds Tender Is The
Night and a copy of the Bible which she hands to Annas father who in turn
examines them with great care and deliberation

ANNAS FATHER
This looks to me like a good sign Dont you
think so As far as Im concerned anyone who
reads the Bible could not have committed an act
of impropriety Why as a matter of fact I
remember when I was in China many years ago I
happened to be involved in a similar situation
concerning an English woman the wife of
Ambassador Shafford a good friend of mine
There too we found a Bible And I said at
the time that whatever had happened that clue
alone had definitely ruled out the possibility
of suicide Why it was logical I said
that whoever reads the Bible believes in God
and therefore

(then turning to Claudia in an

almost supplicating tone of voice)
No You dont believe it Well as a matter of
fact I was right The woman was found two
days later It was a case of amnesia

MARSHAL
Sir if you have no objections may we start
the search

Annas father turns around to look at the bloodhounds who are already
sniffing the air for a scent and anxious to get on with the hunt Then he
throws a quick glance at his daughters valise once more and with an air of
disgust and irritation walks off in a huff followed by Claudia

ATTENDANT
(to the Marshal)
Get everybody out of the way

MARSHAL
Okay Ill send them down to that part of the
beach over there

After they all have left the area the attendant leads the two bloodhounds
over to Annas valise instructs them to pick up the scent then takes them
up to the very top of the island where he subsequently unties them from his
leash and sets them off

Claudia and Annas father arrive on the beach where Patrizia Giulia
Corrado Raimondo and one of the sailors are seated on a pile of rocks

As the dogs begin running in different directions over the island trying to
track down the scent from Annas valise the entire group remains silent
awaiting the outcome of the search Suddenly the bloodhounds come racing
down the slope heading directly towards the beach where they are gathered
apparently hot on the trail of some familiar scent To everybodys amazement
the dogs stop in front of Claudia jumping excitedly and barking at her as
though they had found their prey Claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified
with fear She turns around and sees the others all staring at her But she
cannot understand why they are looking at her that way nor why the dogs have
stopped right in front of her Then as if struck by a sudden flash of
memory she touches her dress and cries out

CLAUDIA
Its because of this The dress Its
because of this dress Anna gave it to me
yesterday right after the swim
Completely relieved Claudia smiles and bends over to pet the dogs as the
attendant comes up to them and ties the leash back on to their necks Then he
leads them away and heads once again up the slope towards the top of the
island Annas father seems almost disillusioned by the negative results of
the search Corrado also feels dissatisfied and addressing himself to the
Marshal says

CORRADO
And what are we going to do now

MARSHAL
Well try again

PATRIZIA
But is it really necessary Those two
beasts How absurd

Meanwhile the patrol boat has returned and is pulling ashore Giulia is the
first one to notice its arrival and she calls out to the others that Sandro
is back Then she goes over to where Annas father is standing

GIULIA
Sandros here

ANNAS FATHER
(coldly)
I dont know him

GIULIA
It seems to me that at a moment like this

ANNAS FATHER
I dont want to know him

By this time Sandro has come ashore followed by the carabiniere and
immediately goes up to Claudia

SANDRO
Claudia listen Claudia

But Claudia hardly looks at him and seeing Corrado approaching she moves
away from Sandro

CORRADO
(to Sandro)
I didnt think youd be back so early

CARABINIERE
(interrupting)
We didnt check the other islands so

CORRADO
And why didnt you go there

CARABINIERE
(referring to Sandro)
He wanted to come back

The sailors have unloaded the crate of cigarettes from the patrol boat and
the Marshal is getting all the details from the carabiniere

MARSHAL
Up until now those smugglers were operating
only around the Palermo area This will be a
nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo
Call up headquarters Bring them up to date and
have them give you instructions on what to do
with this crate

CORRADO
So the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might
have also been that of these smugglers Could it
be possible then that Anna

MARSHAL
(evading Corrados question
and pursuing his own thoughts
I wonder where they could have unloaded the

stuff Maybe right here at Lisca
CORRADO
I was saying it might even be possible that

Anna had left with them

MARSHAL
But for what reason would she have wanted to go
away

CORRADO
Listen Marshal As for there being reasons
for going away anyone of us might have three
thousand of them So you can assume that she
had them What I want to know is it possible
that the smugglers might have taken her aboard

MARSHAL
I think its possible

A SAILOR
(calling from the patrol boat)
Marshal Headquarters is calling They have

an important message

MARSHAL
What is it about

SAILOR
Theyve stopped a suspicious-looking boat a
few miles from here yesterday afternoon The

crew has been taken to Milazzo for questioning

The Marshal takes off for the patrol boat and Corrado goes over to Annas
father
CORRADO
Did you hear that What do you plan on doing

ANNAS FATHER
(resignedly)
We are in the hands of God

SANDRO

Thats trueBut in the meantime as far as
Im concerned its absolutely necessary to go
to Milazzo

(directly to Annas father)
I know that you have no desire to meet me and
I shall take pains not to impose myself upon
you But besides you I am the closest person
to your daughter

ANNAS FATHER
However that may be at this moment my daughter
has more need of her father than of you

SANDRO
Pardon me for being so frank but there are
certain things that a father -- especially a

father like you --cannot understand So dont
be stubborn Im coming with you

As soon as he finishes saying this Sandro turns around and looks at Claudia
as though he had just now realized that she was there listening to him
Claudia goes to the gangplank and boards the yacht disappearing into the
cabin Having followed her with his gaze Sandro then turns to Patrizia

SANDRO
Patrizia what are you going to do

PATRIZIA
What do you want us to do I dont know
myself But well do something
SANDRO

Ill go and get my valise

Sandro goes aboard the yacht and enters the cabin On the way to his room he
meets Claudia who has just changed clothes and is about to return ashore
They stare at each other for a moment without saying anything But the
intensity in Claudias look mixed with fear and desire is so overpowering
that Sandro takes her in his arms and kisses her Claudia immediately
releases herself from his embrace but for the moment it lasted the kiss was
full and passionate Then she turns and goes out on deck Sandro remains
there momentarily stunned then picks up his valise and returns ashore

As Claudia followed by Sandro steps back on the beach she is met by
Patrizia

PATRIZIA
Weve decided to go to Montaldos place In
fact Ettore should already be there

SANDRO
(intervening)
Good Then Ill meet you there

He says this primarily for Claudias sake hoping to catch her eye But she
keeps her head bowed low and doesnt look up After a moment of hesitation
Sandro turns away and heads towards the small motorboat in which Annas
father arrived from the mainland And without saying another word he climbs
aboard Patrizia places her arm around Claudias waist and together they
start walking towards the yacht But upon reaching the foot of the gangplank
Claudia stops

CLAUDIA
Im going with the patrol boat to make a tour
around the islands

PATRIZIA
To do what

CLAUDIA
I just cant leave without first searching
those islands one by one

PATRIZIA
But arent you tired I can just about manage
to stand on my feet
(then turning around to look
for Raimondo she calls out)
Raimondo

RAIMONDO
Here I am Patrizia Im always here

PATRIZIA
Claudia isnt coming with us Will you please
take care of her luggage Thanks

Raimondo goes aboard the yacht and returns with Claudias valise He consigns
it to one of the carabinieri who in turn takes it aboard the patrol boat
Claudia follows him aboard The Marshal comes out of the radio room steps
ashore then joins Sandro and Annas father on the motorboat while Patrizia
Giulia Corrado and Raimondo go aboard the yacht

kk

In the seaport town of Milazzo on the Sicilian mainland Sandro and Annas
father are seated in an office at police headquarters The sailors picked up
on a charge of carrying contraband are being questioned by the police
Lieutenant

SAILOR
No sir Lieutenant we werent even able to
drop anchor once the sea was too rough
The Lieutenant motions for the sailor to come up to the desk then points
a sheet of paper in front of him

LIEUTENANT
Okay Just sign here
(turning to a guard
standing at the door)
Have the next one come in Hes the last
isnt he

Another sailor enters and timidly approaches the Lieutenants desk He is
rather young and his face is completely bronzed by the sun

LIEUTENANT
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home
Is that right

YOUNG SAILOR
Yes sir My sister is sick and my
father too

LIEUTENANT
So thats why youve turned to smuggling eh
You need the money Now I can help you I can
see that you get some assistance from the
government But first theres a little
formality weve got to take care of Just a
few questions and then we can all go to
lunch Your friend tells me you dropped
anchor three times

The sailor starts as though taken by surprise then quickly answers

YOUNG SAILOR
Yes Sir Three times

LIEUTENANT

(to Sandro and Annas father)
Now were getting somewhere Theyre beginning
to contradict each other

(then facing the sailor again)
Now look here your friend just swore to me
that you werent able to do any fishing at all
because the sea was too rough And what about
the other boat

YOUNG SAILOR
What other boat

LIEUTENANT
Now look my men saw it and they also saw you
men throwing those crates overboard What have
you got to say about that

YOUNG SAILOR
(stuttering)
Io I wasnt feeling well I I was
sleeping I dont know anything I
Im all mixed up and

Sandro is unable to control himself any longer He gets up walks over to the
sailor and yells in his face

SANDRO
But what are you saying What are you
saying

The Lieutenant motions to Sandro to be quiet then calmly rises from his desk
and continues

LIEUTENANT
Now look here Im ready to forget the whole
thing the cigarettes the contraband --
everything If you would only tell me you or
your friends whether the girl was aboard
your boat and how far she went

They all remain silent The Lieutenant motions to the guard who then leads
the sailors out of the office

LIEUTENANT

(to Annas father)
Just as I thought Even if you caught them in
the act theyd deny it They always deny
everything And then in this case if they
were to admit having had the girl aboard it
would mean theyd be admitting to the charge
of carrying contraband Oh its easy to say
talk But if they did talk the following
morning youd find them cold dead in front of
their doorstep

ANNAS FATHER
I think it would be worth my while to take a
run over to Palermo The Chief of Police there
is a very good friend of mine and Im sure
hell do whatever he can I feel were wasting
our time here Excuse me Lieutenant I hope
we see each other again under better
circumstances And thanks for everything

Bidding goodbye to the Lieutenant Annas father leaves without looking at
Sandro A moment later Sandro folds the newspaper he was reading tucks it
under his arm and starts heading towards the door

LIEUTENANT
At any rate well continue investigating I
know that headquarters has sent out an alarm to
all areas

SANDRO
(showing the newspaper
to the Lieutenant)
Tell me Lieutenant do you happen to know this
FZ who wrote this article here

The Lieutenant takes a look at the paper which carries a two-column story
headed DISAPPEARANCE OF A ROMAN TOURIST AT LISCA BIANCA

LIEUTENANT
Thats Francesco Zuria Hes the news
correspondent

SANDRO

Where can we locate him Dont you think that
by offering a reward to anyone who can give us
some information

LIEUTENANT
Zuria is in Messina You might try him Shall
we phone him

From the opposite end of the corridor through which Sandro and the Lieutenant
are walking appears the Sergeant who was in charge of the patrol boat on
which Claudia toured the islands in search of Anna After saluting his
superior the Sergeant says

SERGEANT
Have you any instructions for me Lieutenant
May I return to Lipari

LIEUTENANT
Yes With whom did you leave the crate of
cigarettes

SERGEANT
I left it at the warehouse

The Sergeant again salutes his superior then continues on his way along the
corridor Sandro abruptly turns around and follows after him

SANDRO
Pardon me Sergeant but when did you get back

SERGEANT
About two hours ago

SANDRO
And the young lady who was with you

SERGEANT
I dont know She said she had to catch a

train

Sandro remains a while absorbed in his thoughts then hurriedly leaves the
building and heads towards the station

kk
On her way to the waiting room of the station Claudia purchases a newspaper
then goes over to an empty bench and sits down Turning to the local news
section she suddenly comes upon the article announcing Annas disappearance

A moment later Sandro appears at the door Claudia looks up at him but
doesnt say a word He walks over and sits down beside her

SANDRO

Where are you going To Montaldos
CLAUDIA

Yes
SANDRO

Then Ill go with you
There is a moment of silence then Claudia shows him the newspaper article
CLAUDIA

Have you read it Theyre asking for anyone
with information to get in touch with them

SANDRO
Yes I had also thought of going there to talk
with them

CLAUDIA

Yes you should go

SANDRO
But then when will we see each other

Claudia looks at him imploringly intent on making him understand without
having to tell him outright that it is not a question of their seeing each
other Sandro of course does realize and suddenly springs to his feet and
nervously begins pacing back and forth across the waiting room Claudia in
turn also rises and goes over to him

CLAUDIA
I know its difficult But if you go on like
this it will become even more difficult

The bell announcing the trains arrival is sounded Sandro turns around and
faces Claudia almost with a sense of helpless despair

CLAUDIA
Please dont look so solemn And dont wait
for the train to come in

But Sandro doesnt move And again Claudia insists imploring him not to
stay although she realizes full well that this may mean a final goodbye

CLAUDIA
Please please leave I dont want to look out
of the window and wave to you with a
handkerchief
Sandro still doesnt move and is about to say something but Claudia looks
at him so pleadingly and with such a determined expression that he finally
succumbs and starts walking towards the exit behind the train tracks

The train has just pulled into the station The platform is completely empty
and Claudia is the only one to board the train She climbs up the steps and
the door is closed behind her A second later she appears at the window
looks out briefly then disappears into her compartment The station master
raises the signal for the engine to start a short whistle is heard and soon
the train gets under way

Sandro dashes out across the tracks swings open one of the doors and boards
the train as it picks up speed and pulls away from the station

Claudia is seated in a corner near the window looking out She appears
completely relaxed and totally drained of energy fatigued after so much
tension After a few seconds she turns around and is abruptly startled to
see Sandro standing nearby in the corridor He comes over to her compartment
and takes a seat directly opposite to hers Claudia is absolutely furious

CLAUDIA
Go ahead now say something I want to know
just what it is we have to say to each other

Sandro remains silent waiting for Claudia to settle down and calm herself
But she continues to reproach him

CLAUDIA
Sandro I dont want you to come with me I
dont want to see you How can I make it

clear to youWhy did you come

SANDRO
I dont know why I just couldnt help it

CLAUDIA
But sooner or later weve got to end this
relationship And its better to do it right

now

SANDRO
I have no desire to sacrifice myself Its
idiotic to sacrifice oneself Why For

whom If Anna were here I might understand your
scruples But shes not

CLAUDIA
(deeply wounded)
Oh Sandro
SANDRO

Im sorry I didnt want to sound cynical But
isnt it better to look things squarely in the
eye

CLAUDIA
For me they are exactly as they were when we
met three days ago -- just three days ago
dont you realize And you and Anna No I
guess they arent like that any more My God
is it possible to forget in such a short time
for things to change so quickly

SANDRO
It takes even less

CLAUDIA
But its so sad So terribly sad Im not used
to it Im not ready for it You know I

have never been so upset in my life Sandro
why dont you help me

SANDRO

I think the only way to help ourselves Claudia

is for us to be together

CLAUDIA
No Im sure it wont Move over there Lets
make believe nothing happened And when we get
to the next station get off

SANDRO
And what about you

CLAUDIA
Me I I Please leave me alone

Suddenly she stands up and goes into the corridor The car is
-- one half is first class the other second Claudia stops in
second-class compartment from which the sound of two voices is
that of a woman -- sweet very delicate and very feminine the

of an old type
front of a

heard One is
other is that

of a man with a Sicilian accent Sandro joins Claudia Standing there

together they hear the conversation

WOMANS VOICE
I work there but Im really a stranger

MANS VOICE
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you
and she has often spoken to me about you

WOMANS VOICE
And who is she Does she work in Catania

MANS VOICE
Yes she takes care of the garden

WOMANS VOICE
Then its impossible for her to know me In the
villa where Im at we have a male gardener

MANS VOICE
So Thats logical You see both being
gardeners they spoke about you to one another
WOMANS VOICE
And what did they say about me

MANS VOICE
They told me that you were a very nice girl
that you always mind your business In other
words things of that sort

There is a moment of silence Then the sound of music is heard coming from
the compartment Claudia and Sandro look at one another with a smile on their
faces Then Claudia leans over to peek into the compartment The woman is
young she has thick wavy brown hair He is one of those typical seducers
from the provinces with black hair There is a tiny radio between them
Sandro also takes a peek into the compartment Then they withdraw as the two
resume their conversation

WOMANS VOICE
We have a radio like this too

MANS VOICE
No not like this one

WOMANS VOICE
And why wouldnt we have one like this

MANS VOICE
Because this is a Chinese radio

Another pause Sandro takes hold of Claudias hand and presses it She
doesnt resist but allows him to do it

WOMANS VOICE
Certainly a radio this small is very practical
Its especially useful for I dont know
for traveling

MANS VOICE
But for you what comes first music or love

Claudia presses up close to Sandro amused and at the same time obviously
moved

WOMANS VOICE
Music of course To get a sweetheart one has
to look around but to get a radio all you
have to do is buy one

MANS VOICE

Ah no For me love comes first Im a man
and I know whats what first love and then
music

Claudia laughs but she is still very upset All of a sudden she starts and
looks out the little window The train is coming into a station and is
beginning to slow down Claudia grabs Sandro by the sleeve and pulls him
through the corridor Sandro tries to resist
SANDRO
Claudia listen to me

CLAUDIA
No Sandro please I ask you as a favor

She continues to drag him through the corridor until they finally reach the
platform Then she opens the door They are both highly emotional Claudia is
almost hysterical

CLAUDIA
Promise that you wont try to look for me
you shouldnt try to look for me any more

SANDRO
But why Claudia Why

Sandro tries to grab her in his arms but Claudia pushes him away almost
with a sense of violence as though she were afraid she might change her mind
once in his arms In the meantime the train has come to a stop in the
station Sandro pauses to look at Claudia once more

SANDRO
Even if you chase me away I Claudia lets
not wait any longer After it will be too
late Come with me

Claudia is visibly battling with herself Then in one last moment of
decision she pushes Sandro towards the door and goes back into the car

Once on the ground Sandro walks back and forth along the platform to see if
he can find Claudia hoping she might look out the window to wave goodbye
But she doesnt appear The train starts to move as Sandro desperately tries
to catch a glimpse of Claudia But she is not to be seen Sandro starts
running along the platform but the train is now going too fast He stops --
angry disappointed and upset

kk

At the entrance-way of a luxurious villa Claudia who has just arrived is
greeted by the Princess She is an elderly woman rather ordinary in
appearance but very aristocratic in taste and manner

PRINCESS
Did you have a good trip It is such a
magnificent day I am very happy that Sicily is
able to give you so warm a welcome And you do
deserve it Youre such a lovely blonde Come
my dear

Claudia smiles and follows the Princess into the garden

PRINCESS
And where are you from
CLAUDIA
From Rome

PRINCESS
Oh how nice So youre from Rome And would
you happen to know of some intelligent
clergyman in Rome who might be willing to come
here and stay with us We have our own private
little chapel It is a masterpiece with
seventeenth-century frescoes and the
remains of all our dead ancestors a wonderful
collection He would find it very convenient
there and could say his own masses Then he
would have to spend a little time with my
husband who never sees anyone to keep him
occupied

CLAUDIA
An intelligent clergyman Princess But I
think the intelligent clergymen of today have
so many other things to do

PRINCESS
Well perhaps one with a little physical
handicap One who is slightly lame for
example

In the meantime they have arrived at a shady alcove where seated in various
wicker lounge chairs are Patrizia Giulia and a young man dressed in simple
casual clothes The first one to notice Claudia and to greet her with warm
cordiality is Giulia

GIULIA
Well finally We were beginning to get worried
about you too

Claudia plunks herself down in one of the lounge chairs next to Patrizia The
young man rises and bows slightly

PATRIZIA
But where did you finally end up

CLAUDIA
It was futile We went all over

There is a moment of silence the thought of Anna returns to weigh on the
group Claudia pours herself an orange drink from a pitcher on the table
beside her

CLAUDIA
(referring to Anna)
But why does she do these things
(she takes a sip from
her glass then rises)
I cant stand it any more

She takes a few steps looks around at the villa and at the other end of the
alcove sees Corrado and Ettore saying goodbye to a pair of elderly gentlemen

GIULIA
(to Corrado and Ettore)
But how can you carry on a discussion in this
heat

CORRADO
When one approaches fifty my dear he is
affected only by the cold

ETTORE
(noticing Claudia)
And who is this

PATRIZIA
This is Claudia Annas friend
(to Claudia)
Youve never met my husband have you

Ettore immediately recalls Claudias name from a previous conversation that
was apparently held before she arrived

ETTORE
By the way have you phoned him

CORRADO
You mean Sandro I told you already Hes not
in At least hes not at the hotel

ETTORE
Now look what has to go and happen At a time
when Ill be needing him How can we discuss
things when we lack dates and figures

PATRIZIA
But didnt he say he was coming here

Now with all this talk about Sandro the sense of relaxation Claudia had
felt upon her arrival has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes
more and more noticeable

ETTORE
Well what are you all waiting for Send a car
out to get him He cant be more than a couple
of hundred miles away

GIULIA
To me the fact that hasnt shown up is a good
sign Do you want to bet that hes found Anna

ETTORE
Maybe But do you know that forty thousand
persons a year disappear in Italy without
leaving a single trace behind them Forty
thousand Almost as much as the entire
population of San Siro Raimondo will you go
and see if you can locate Sandro

RAIMONDO
Okay

A gong announcing lunch resounds throughout the garden

PATRIZIA
First let the poor thing have something to eat

ETTORE
It wouldnt really do you any harm to skip a
meal

PRINCESS
Ive never met this Sandro What kind of a
person is he He couldnt have done her in
himself by any chance

ETTORE
(breaking out into a loud laugh)
Sandro Oh sure I can see Sandro calling

Anna over to him and saying Listen Anna I
intend to get rid of you but since its so
painful and complicated and besides I
dont happen to have a gun on me why dont
you do me a favor and get rid of yourself on
your own

There is a moment of complete dead silence during which the same disturbing
thought flashes across the minds of all those who are present like a sudden
revelation

GIULIA
My God how could we joke over something like
that We should be ashamed of ourselves

PRINCESS
(rising)
Come on lets go

They all get up except Claudia She is left so completely shaken by the
conversation by the thought that it seems she no longer has the strength to
move Giulia after giving Corrado a defiant look turns and smiles at the
young man who had stopped to wait for her

GIULIA
(to Claudia referring
to the young man)
Goffredo is the Princess nephew Hes
eighteen years old the lucky boy And what do
you know -- he paints

GOFFREDO
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand All you
need is to buy some oils and start painting
Even Rembrandt did the same
Giulia laughs with a strange sense of excitement then takes Goffredo by the
arm and leaves Claudia remains alone She watches the group heading towards
the house Giulia holding tight to Goffredo Ettore to Patrizia Their
voices are heard somewhat unclear

ETTORE
But where is the Prince Is he well

PRINCESS
The last time I saw him the day before
yesterday it seemed he was well

ETTORE
Princess why dont you sell this villa I
would turn it into a lovely psychiatric clinic

PRINCESS
Its a little like that already

Finally even Claudia starts moving slowly behind the others but she is
still very much upset

kk

A crowd of people that keeps growing and growing from one moment to the next
is gathered in one of the main streets of Messina in front of a mens store
with its shutters half-shut The local police are unable to control the flow
of traffic which has been blocked as a result of the crowd The cars are
packed close to one another raising a great din with their horns The throng
is composed chiefly of young men pushing and climbing over each other to get
near the shop to see inside Sandro tries to make his way through the crowd
in an attempt to get up close himself but the confusion is so great that he
finds the going very difficult Remarks and comments are heard above the
noise

FIRST YOUNG MAN
Who is it Sophia Loren

SECOND YOUNG MAN
Oh no Its some model from Turin with a
low-cut dress

OTHER VOICES
Its Queen Saroya I saw her So who
could it be

THIRD YOUNG MAN
Theyve torn her dress Shes almost nude
She ran into the shop to hide herself

A police siren is heard from afar then before long it fills the air and
dominates every other sound An Alfa Romeo pulls up followed by a police
wagon full of policemen Both vehicles maneuver their way through the crowd
like snakes through a jungle and stop right in front of the shop Sandro
takes advantage of the opening created by the two cars and thus finds himself
a few steps away from the door Bending over in order to see through the
small space left open by the half-drawn shutters he notices several
newspapermen and photographers

SANDRO
(to one of the newspapermen)
Which one of you is Zuria

NEWSPAPERMAN
Hes inside

Meanwhile the policemen have come out of the wagon and arrive at the door of
the shop with the Chief of Police leading the way One of them raises the
shutter and the crowd which has backed away slightly at the insistence of
the police begins pressing forward threateningly Soon pandemonium breaks
loose In the confusion Sandro manages to get inside the store along with
the policemen and two photographers The shutter is again lowered just a few
inches behind him

Standing in the middle of the shop is a most charming and provocative young
brunette with tight-fitting pants and a blouse that is open almost from the
neck to the waist She is wearing nothing under her blouse so that with
every movement of her body one cannot help catching a glimpse of her naked
breasts As the policemen come forward she receives them with a smile
Sandro asks one of the journalists standing nearby if he can tell him which
one of them is Zuria The journalist points to a man who is only a few steps
away -- a man not very old but who has a ravaged face and whose hair is
almost completely white

SANDRO
Zuria

ZURIA
Yes Until proven otherwise

SANDRO
I would like to ask you something

ZURIA
Wait a moment Cant you see Im busy

Everybody is gathered around the Chief of Police and the girl The store
clerks are looking at her admiringly The manager most upset is explaining
the situation to the Chief of Police

MANAGER
I phoned you Chief because in view of the
situation I thought it best

The girl interrupts him She has a very self-satisfied look on her face

GIRL
I came down here to buy a foulard Suddenly
I realized that little by little directly
behind me I was being followed by so many
men and more and more of them kept coming
CHIEF OF POLICE
Well I should think so Dressed like that

GIRL
But I have always gone around like this
everywhere in the world Nothing like this has
ever happened to me before

Zuria turns to Sandro and clears his throat Outside the crowd becomes very
noisy

ZURIA
(to the girl)
How old are you

GIRL
Nineteen My name is Gloria Perkins Im
married and a writer by profession I write in
a trance almost always in contact with people
who are dead Tolstoi for example or
Shakespeare But the movies also interest me

Zuria nods to Sandro as if to say now watch this

ZURIA
How do you find the men of Messina Are you
shocked by their warm display of friendliness

GIRL
No why should I be shocked Were in Italy
not Finland

ZURIA
And how were you received in Palermo

The girl turns around and looks down at Zuria with contempt but she manages
to remain calm

GIRL
In Palermo I was with my husband Now Im
going to Capri to write an article for the
Tourist Office

Zuria clears his throat again and whispers to Sandro

ZURIA
She did exactly the same thing in Palermo

CHIEF OF POLICE
(to the girl)
If you want to go back to your hotel were
ready to escort you

GIRL
Oh yes thank you

Photographer snaps a flash photo The girl immediately strikes a pose Other
flashes follow The clerks ask for her autograph One of the policemen raises
the shutter the girl comes forward smiling and is greeted with a certain
kind of roar from the crowd The group leaves the shop Sandro and Zuria also
come out The girl ushered out by the policemen climbs into the Alfa Romeo
The guard holds the crowd back There are more camera flashes More smiles
from the pretty stranger Finally the car pulls out followed by the police
wagon Sandro and Zuria watch the car disappear through the crowd which
starts to disperse The din however is still enormous due to the
unsnarling of the traffic jam

ZURIA
Do you like her

Sandro shrugs his shoulders somewhat surprised by the journalists question

ZURIA
She costs a hundred thousand lire

SANDRO
Youre kidding

ZURIA

No Im not Why do you think she does all
this Its one of the many ways she can put
herself on display When you bait the trap the
mouse will snap To tell you the truth if it
wasnt for the fact that one hundred thousand
lire represents my whole months salary well
But you had something you wanted to ask me

Sandro is still looking at the journalist with a sense of incredulity almost
as if he felt Zurias conversation was something out of this world But he is
brought back to reality by Zurias last remark which is made as the
journalist starts walking at a very hurried pace

SANDRO
I read one of your articles regarding the
disappearance of a girl Im that girls fianc

ZURIA
Oh Im sorry I have to rush but Ive got to
write a story about this thing that just
happened Tell me exactly how it all turned
out
SANDRO
(impatiently)

Now listen if I had any information I
wouldnt have come here to ask you But I see
that you too lack any information

The journalist casts a sidewards glance at Sandro He is a bitter and
sarcastic man one who is completely absorbed with his own little problems
and his own daily routine But for this very reason he is quite capable of
taking any kind of insult either big or small

ZURIA
As a matter of fact Ive already had several
phone calls on that article One said they had
seen the missing girl in an automobile
somewhere in Rome Another one said they saw
her on the pier talking with some strange
sailors Could be she secretly left the
island by boat

SANDRO
Is that possible

ZURIA
Who knows Another one has it that she
entered a store in Troina This information
comes from the storekeeper himself who stated
that such and such a girl had bought I dont
know what in his store at Troina

SANDRO
Is that far from here

ZURIA
About fifty miles or so If you want Ill give
you the name of the storekeeper

SANDRO
Yes of course But you should also print
that in your paper But right away tomorrow
morning Its the local Palermo paper isnt
it I mean its widely read

ZURIA
Yes but why do you think our readers would be
interested in such news now Even if I sent it
the editors wouldnt print it

SANDRO
You really must do me this one favor

ZURIA
Pardon me but why must I do you a favor

SANDRO
Then lets call it a business proposition
Something to round out your salary

The journalist clears his throat without answering Then he grabs Sandro by
the arm and takes him back to the other side of the street where a few
people left over from the crowd are still discussing the incident that just
took place as they gradually drift away from the scene The traffic is now
back to normal

kk

At the Princess villa Claudia is in her room applying some fresh make-up
in front of a small dressing table Although she appears thoroughly engrossed
in all the minute details of her make-up nevertheless she seems
considerably interested in any sound that comes through her window

The rumble of a motor is heard Claudia runs to the window and looks out into
the garden A dark car pulls up in front of the service entrance A uniformed
chauffeur gets out of the car and enters the house carrying a package under
his arm There is an obvious look of disappointment on Claudias face She is
about to return to the dressing table when she notices there in the garden
Giulia heading towards the house accompanied by the young Prince Goffredo
Claudia is profoundly shocked by Giulias behavior as she laughs jokes
bends over to pick up some flowers and skips along unashamedly

In the meantime Patrizia has entered the room with two wigs one of which
she is wearing and the other in her hand She also has on a cocktail dress
but one that is more elaborate than Claudias Patrizia immediately goes up
to the mirror of the dressing table and while she finishes arranging the wig
on her head says to her friend

PATRIZIA
Are you ready Im not Thats all we needed --
a cocktail party The vitality some people
have irritates me
(indicating the wig on her head)
How does it look

Claudia who has meanwhile tried on the other wig and is looking at herself
in the mirror turns around to Patrizia

CLAUDIA
(ironically)
Its divine
PATRIZIA

You say that just to flatter me

CLAUDIA
Do you consider that a compliment

PATRIZIA
No

The two of them burst out laughing and together they leave the room Then
after a few steps through the corridor they separate with a friendly gesture
towards each other Patrizia goes into her room while Claudia prepares to
descend the wide stairway Coming up the same stairway are Giulia and the
young Prince Goffredo There is something of an embarrassing moment between
them Then Giulia aware of Claudias presence detaches herself from
Goffredo and as they reach the top of the stairs she comes over to Claudia
and takes her by the wrist in order to confide with her more intimately

GIULIA
He wants to show me his paintings He wont
let go of me anymore Poor thing he must
have a crush on me

She laughs with an obvious sense of amusement but she is also tickled by her
own vanity Claudia looks at her without knowing what to say to her
GIULIA
(even more excited)
Please you come too

CLAUDIA
But for what reason should I come there

GIULIA
Please do come Dont leave me alone with
him Hes capable of I dont know Have

you noticed his eyes

Claudia resigns herself to escorting Giulia to the floor up above The very
top of the stairway leads to an attic where Goffredo is leaning over the
railing looking down

GOFFREDO
Giulia

GIULIA
Here I am

Seeing the two of them arriving together the young Prince feels
disappointed But he knows he has to cover his intentions with a show of good
manners When the two women reach the top of the stairs he bows to Claudia
in a most respectful fashion Then he leads them down a low and narrow
corridor to a door they pass through

The attic is bright and spacious with slanted roof and two huge windows It
is filled with paintings easels canvases brushes and oils As soon as
Giulia enters the studio she moves away from Claudia and attaches herself to
the young Prince who is setting up one of his paintings on an easel beside
one of the windows Claudia looks around the room with a sense of
indifference Going over to the window she looks out and sees a vast
panorama of the countryside

Giulia looks at the painting with a certain amount of surprise It is a
picture of a nude woman a shapely figure slightly plump in the manner of
Renoir

GIULIA
Claudia come and see Its a nude

Claudia is looking through the paintings that lean up against the wall face
backwards She turns one around a nude woman A second another nude woman
A third the same

CLAUDIA
Theyre all nudes if Im not mistaken

GIULIA
(to Goffredo)
But why all nudes

GOFFREDO
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a
woman

GIULIA
And where do you find the models

GOFFREDO
Oh there are as many as one wants

GIULIA
(turning to Claudia)
I thought the model was something obsolete
nowadays Didnt you Claudia

Claudia goes back to look out the window a group of flying birds swoops down
to land directly under the roof The birds settle themselves in a little nest
directly in front of the window Claudia bends over to get a better look and
is actually able to see the little nest as she hears behind her the exchange
of remarks between Giulia and the young Prince

GOFFREDO
Its strange how anxious women are to display
themselves Its almost a natural inclination

GIULIA
But how could they pose like that I couldnt

GOFFREDO
(with a grave youthful sensuality)
Why dont you try

GIULIA
Me Goffredo youre mad
(turning to Claudia)
Hes mad
CLAUDIA
Not really

Claudia moves away from the window and continues to look at Giulia and
Goffredo with a deep sense of amazement Giulia is euphoric kittenish and
trembling with excitement Goffredo is firm resolute and serious

GIULIA
Dont you ever paint men

GOFFREDO
Answer me why dont you try posing Ill paint
you a beautiful portrait

GIULIA
But why me Ask Claudia shes much more
beautiful than me

GOFFREDO
(insistent)
But I want to paint you You appeal to me more
GIULIA
(timidly)
I appeal to you more

Giulia glances over at Claudia who is still preoccupied looking out of the
window then screws up her courage and boldly advances towards Goffredo
making her intentions clearly understood Goffredo immediately responds to
her invitation and draws himself close up against her There is a moment of
hesitation then a kiss -- awkward but passionately violent Giulia on her
part is completely shameless Claudia turns around exactly at that moment
when the two of them are caught up in a feverish embrace She looks at them
completely dumbfounded then takes a few steps forward as though she doesnt
believe her own eyes

CLAUDIA
(almost unconsciously)
Giulia

Giulia quickly turns around her face is flushed with excitement but also
with an expression that seems somewhat triumphant Before anybody has a
chance to say anything she heads towards the door swings it open and stands
firmly on the threshold obviously intent on telling Claudia to leave In
fact Claudia doesnt wait to be told but immediately walks out into the
hallway

GIULIA
And tell Corrado too that Im here if he
wants me You can also tell him that my tiny
little heart is beating like mad and that at
this moment its the only thing that interests
me Is that clear

CLAUDIA
It couldnt be any clearer

Giulia takes a few steps backward into the room and seeing Claudia still
there looking at her strangely exclaims

GIULIA
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace

CLAUDIA
I think all you have to do Giulia is to close
the door

And with a violent bang that leaves Claudia startled Giulia slams the door
shut Claudia remains standing there for a moment still very much amazed
But she is aroused from her stupor by the sound of a car pulling into the
courtyard Then she rapidly starts descending the stairs

Claudia has reached the hallway leading out to the garden and is anxiously
waiting there looking at the car that has just arrived But she is not able
to distinguish exactly who it is and her view is also blocked by Ettore and
Corrado who have just come out of the house and are now standing in front of
the car So she walks out to the garden and joins the group A certain look
of disappointment spreads over her face as she sees only Raimondo come out of
the car Evidently Sandro has not been located
RAIMONDO

Hes not at the hotel and he probably wasnt
even in Milazzo The room clerk said he rented
a car

Claudia moves away from the group as though she has heard enough She goes
over to lean against an enormous vase standing there on the side Her hands
are trembling In back of her she hears the sounds of the others voices but
cannot distinguish what they are saying Then Patrizia arrives and calls out
Claudias name But she has to repeat it a second time before Claudia
realizes she is being called

PATRIZIA
Claudia Lets go

Claudia turns around but doesnt move Another car pulls up driven by the
same chauffeur who had evidently picked her up the other day and in which
the Princess is already seated

CLAUDIA
Im not coming

PATRIZIA
But then why did you bother changing

Patrizia remains puzzled for a moment as though searching for a motive behind
Claudias sudden decision then discreetly turns away without insisting and
goes over to the car In the meantime Giulia and Goffredo have come out
through the hallway and head towards one of the two cars Corrado looks at
them with a cold and critical stare then with a deliberate intent to prick
Giulias feelings he says

CORRADO
Giulia is like Oscar Wilde give her the
superfluous and she will do without the
essential

Ettore breaks out into a laugh as he helps Patrizia into the car

ETTORE
Thats him hed die if he didnt have somebody
to quote He comes up with quotations like that
even at a board of directors meeting

Claudia watches them getting into the car She is beside herself completely
wrapped up in her own thoughts

kk

In the rear of a general store on the outskirts of a small Sicilian town a
woman is seated at the window She is very young thin and irascible Up
front her husband is speaking with Sandro and as she listens attentively to
what he is saying a sarcastic smile spreads over her face

HUSBAND
Be patient I cant remember everything

SANDRO
(indicating the newspaper article)
But it even says what she bought a bar of soap
So theres no point in making believe you cant
remember

After waiting a few seconds to give her husband a chance to explain himself
the wife jumps up from where she is sitting comes over to Sandro and yanks
the paper from his hands Then she starts reading the article in a jerky
manner typical of one who is not too literate

WIFE
A young female stranger whose description
corresponds with that of the missing girl came
into my store

She suddenly stops reading and turns toward Sandro

WIFE
She came and then she left With him But this
one wont admit it
(turning upon her husband furiously)
You think I wasnt aware of it

The husband a young man tries to keep calm and carry on the conversation in
a logical persuasive manner

HUSBAND
But if I was carrying on with the girl why
would I want to give any of this information to
the newspaper

WIFE
Thats what Id like to know myself

HUSBAND
Fine that makes two of us who want to know In
fact three with him

He indicates Sandro Then seeing a fat luscious female customer enter the
store he turns to her and continues

HUSBAND
Ah Lady Amalia would you be interested in
knowing why I told the newspapers about a
certain girl who came here the other day and
then disappeared

The woman anxious to learn about any new bit of gossip becomes immediately
interested

LADY AMALIA
Disappeared Who is she Where When

HUSBAND
And that makes four Anybody else

Sandro a little sick and tired of the whole matter and wanting to put an
end to what has by now become farcical intervenes

SANDRO
You have to be precise Did this girl enter
your store or didnt she

WIFE
(shouting)
Yes

SANDRO
(ignoring her)
Was she blonde or brunette

HUSBAND
(calmly)
Brunette

WIFE
(contradicting him)
Blonde

SANDRO
How was she dressed

HUSBAND
I dont quite remember Seems to me she wore a
black dress

WIFE
(intervening sarcastically)
He doesnt look at dresses he looks at whats
under them

The husband turns around and looks at his wife menacingly

SANDRO
Pardon me but has anyone else been here asking
about this girl

HUSBAND
No I dont think so

SANDRO
Thanks

kk

Sandro leaves the store He walks a few steps along the pavement then sits
down at a small outside table of a nearby caf He looks out over the square
a small Sicilian town quiet and still in the hot afternoon sun Every now
and then he glances up at the country road that winds around the town as
though he were waiting for someone
A few moments later in fact a car comes into view and slows down as it
reaches the square The driver looks out for a place in which to park Sandro
rises to his feet The car comes to a stop a few steps away from him The
driver rushes out of the car to open the door for the person inside it is
Claudia Sandro immediately goes over to meet her looking at her somewhat
amazed Not only does he see her more elegantly dressed than he has ever seen
her before wearing a smartly tailored polka-dot suit but also as an
entirely new person as someone whose beauty he has discovered for the first
time For a moment they continue staring at each other without even
bothering to say hello

CLAUDIA
Any news
SANDRO
Yes but its all so conflicting However

there is some slight indication

Claudia drops her gaze relieved by even that slight note of hope Then she
looks up at him again as though inspired by another sudden thought
something which must have lingered in her mind from one of the Princess
humorous quips Then the owner of the general store appears on the scene
After having dealt his nagging wife a crushing verbal blow he turns to
Sandro but not without first glancing at Claudia for whom it soon becomes
evident he has really come out on the street

HUSBAND
Listen In the paper they forgot to say that
as soon as the girl left here she took the bus
to Noto The bus leaves from the square over
there I saw her clearly I came to the door
to see her off She was a beautiful girl
Lovely pair of legs

While speaking he continues to keep an eye on Claudia with the look of one
who thinks his gaze is loaded with irresistible masculinity All of a sudden
he pulls out a package of Nazionali cigarettes from his pocket and offers one
to Claudia She looks at him dumbfounded then automatically declines with a
shake of her head In turn he lights up a cigarette inhaling the smoke
voluptuously Meanwhile his wife has come upon the scene and looks at him
suspiciously Then with a sad wistful voice she turns to Claudia

WIFE
Youre from Rome arent you I knew right away
because Im from Viterbo He was a soldier

there and so
(indicating her husband and
then quickly continuing)

I dont like it very much here

HUSBAND
(interrupting)
Then why dont you go back

His wife turns and looks at him hatefully exactly in the same manner he had
looked at her
CLAUDIA
How long have you been married

WIFE
Three months

Claudia and Sandro look at each other There is a moment of embarrassment
then Sandro breaks the silence

SANDRO
Well Thanks for the information

They exchange goodbyes then Claudia and Sandro move away from the store and
head towards Claudias car Suddenly Sandro takes Claudia by the hand

SANDRO
Its better if we present a happy picture no

Claudia is about to withdraw her hand but she is taken aback by Sandros
phrase which also fills her with a warm and tender feeling after the squalid
situation with the young storekeeper and his wife Now Sandro opens the door
of the car looks at Claudia as if to ask her consent for what he is about to
do and since Claudia says nothing but just stands there trying to figure out
which one of the feelings struggling within her will win he removes
Claudias valise and closes the door

SANDRO
(to the driver)
Tell the Signora Patrizia that we are
continuing the searchand that the Signorina
Claudia will manage to survive somehow

The driver bows slightly then he climbs into the car and departs Sandro and
Claudia remain there watching the car disappear out of view Now Sandro
turns to look at Claudia and smiles at her Claudia is visibly upset She
doesnt smile back but merely turns away and heads towards Sandros car

kk

Claudia is intent on looking at Sandro who is doing the driving The car is
traveling on a country road but Claudia shows no interest in the landscape
She continues to stare at Sandro as if she wants to know his most secret
thoughts Suddenly feeling himself being stared at Sandro turns towards
Claudia She quickly drops her gaze Then Sandro turns his eyes back to the
road and Claudia looks up at him again

From a bend in the road up ahead preceded by the loud and penetrating blast
of a horn the bus mentioned earlier by the storekeeper appears Sandro
barely manages to stop the car in time off to one side of the road He gets
out and places himself in the middle of the road where he starts signaling
for the bus to stop With a loud screech of its brakes the bus comes to a
stop almost directly in front of him The bus driver opens the window and
leans out

DRIVER
Did your car break down

SANDRO
No I only want some information

Meanwhile the drivers assistant gets down from the bus and the passengers
lean out of the windows Claudia has also gotten out of the car and appears

on the scene

SANDRO
Were searching for a girl of about
twenty-five Seems she boarded this bus two
days ago in the afternoon You should
remember her because she was a stranger around
here

The driver gets down from the bus and comes over to Sandro scratching his
head

DRIVER
She was a little nervous dark-haired with
a kerchief around her head

He turns to his assistant for verification who in turn searches his memory
and then adds

ASSISTANT
Two days ago wasnt there that midwife on
the bus too Sure thats right and she was
talking to some young woman

SANDRO
Can you tell me where she got off

ASSISTANT
All I can tell you is that the midwife is from
X

SANDRO

Okay thanks

Sandro turns and goes back to his car while the others climb back on the bus
which begins to leave Claudia and Sandro remain standing near the car
watching the bus disappear Then Claudia turns and looks out over the fields
She sees a dry riverbed filled with stones that sparkle in the sun beside it
a high rocky bank Sandro stands next to her and she becomes vividly aware of
his presence As she glances at him he turns around then she quickly starts
up a conversation as though she were anxious not to have any romantic mood
develop between them

CLAUDIA
My God Lets hope it was her

Then still feeling Sandros eyes fixed upon her she turns and starts
heading towards the car Sandro catches up with her and takes her hand
Before they climb into the car they look at each other intensely A moment
later the car takes off at full speed
kk

In a courtyard of the midwifes house Sandro and Claudia are questioning a

middle-aged woman

MIDWIFE

I only exchanged a few casual words with her
as one would ordinarily do on a public bus

SANDRO
And do you remember where she got off

MIDWIFE

Wellprobably at the last stop which is Noto

CLAUDIA
After that you didnt see her anymore

The woman pauses for a few seconds and looks at Claudia as though she had
detected some hidden motive behind the question And when she resumes

speaking what she has to say is in sharp contrast to the way she says it
They are words of protest but spoken condescendingly almost sweetly yet

leaving no doubt as to their meaning

MIDWIFE

What are you trying to insinuate young lady

Why should I have seen her again I dont do
anything thats illegitimate

CLAUDIA
Oh no What are you saying Im not
insinuating anything

MIDWIFE
And furthermore my dear young lady because
you really are a dear you know if the story

of that girl is merely a pretext let us say
to get in touch with her then I feel it is my
duty to warn her These things are very very

dangerous especially in a neighborhood like

this where people occupy themselves more with

other peoples affairs than their own

Seeing Claudia being put into an uncomfortable position Sandro

who had been

following the midwifes discussion with a cagey attitude intervenes

SANDRO

Then you should also be able to tell me where a

young girl might stay in Noto are there any
hotels or rooming houses

MIDWIFE
Theres the Trinacria Hotel or the Regina
near the municipal building As for rooming
houses I dont know
SANDRO

Thank you

MIDWIFE
Dont mention it Pleased to be of service
any time

Claudia starts moving hurriedly out of the courtyard followed by Sandro

kk

Sandros car is speeding across a harsh sun-baked landscape bypassing long
lines of peasants returning from the fields the women seated on donkeys the
men on foot The more fortunate among them have horse drawn carts

Claudia is looking at the surrounding countryside and spies an iron bridge
that is all rusty and obviously no longer in use

CLAUDIA
Look at that bridge Who knows why they even
bothered to make it

The car continues onward passing an abandoned factory then a railroad
station also abandoned its tracks covered by weeds the ticket office
haphazardly boarded up with old wooden planks

CLAUDIA
Look at that a factory a station and
look at those tracks all full of weeds But

why

Sandro shrugs his shoulders and continues driving without saying a word Up
ahead a small town comes into view with monotonous rows of newly constructed
homes lined up along the side of the road The car enters the town and stops
Sandro gets out and goes over to a fountain nearby but the fountain is dry
Somewhat surprised he begins to look around And only then do Sandro and
Claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one that
the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut
There is no sign of life anywhere except for the weeds growing between the
cracks in the walls invading and suffocating everything in sight

Claudia gets out of the car joins Sandro and together they start walking
along the streets The sun beats furiously down upon the crumbling houses
upon the church upon the useless monument in the square on which a
dedication is inscribed To The Agricultural Worker

Sandro looks around in absolute silence Claudia is also silent somewhat
dismayed Instinctively she presses up close to Sandro who leads her to a
shady spot where the ground is overgrown with weeds

Sandro and Claudia are lying next to each other on the grass Sandro appears
calm but is actually looking at Claudia as though he were about to embrace
her with his eyes Then he takes her hand Claudia offers no resistance in
fact she entwines her fingers around his almost with a sense of
desperation Sandro tries to kiss her She makes a feeble attempt to resist
looks around and sees the deserted town the barren fields the crumbling
sun-baked walls She turns and looks at Sandro again and now it is she who
kisses him When they break apart they stretch themselves out upon the
grass

Sandro kisses her violently again and again and again

kk

The early twilight shadows are beginning to fall The sky is still clear but
the sun is fading There is a deep silence and the air is absolutely still
In a certain sense Sandros car standing there in the middle of the
deserted street is the only thing alive in that desolate town

Huddled close to each other Claudia and Sandro are asleep on the grass
Lazily Claudia awakens and then Sandro also opens his eyes They are both
somewhat disheveled

CLAUDIA
(faintly audible)
Its late We should be going

Little by little she leaves behind the drowsiness of her deep and peaceful
sleep purring languorously in a typically feminine fashion Sandro smiles
and gently embraces her A moment later Claudia releases herself from
Sandros arms sits up and realizes that the countryside and the town itself
are as black and motionless as death A cold shiver runs down her back and
she quickly comes to her feet

CLAUDIA
Lets get out of here fast This is not a
town its a cemetery

SANDRO
Who knows why they all left

Claudia starts to move but her legs are still numb from her sound sleep and
she hobbles along comically laughing at the same time Sandro also gets up
and finds that his legs are cramped Hobbling and laughing himself he
follows Claudia towards the car But the car baked by the sun is like an
oven They both make boisterous and playful exclamations then another
embrace another kiss Finally they climb into the car and drive off with a
loud roar that echoes up and down the abandoned town

kk

Sandro and Claudia arrive in the town of Noto and pull up on the opposite
side of the street from the Trinacria Hotel As they climb out of the car
Claudia turns to Sandro

CLAUDIA
Sandro maybe its best that you go in alone

SANDRO
Are you joking
CLAUDIA
Dont think that I want to save myself from any
embarrassment from the awkwardness of meeting
Anna Its not that its that you can say
certain things easier if youre alone Please
Sandro do try to understand me It would
look like I was trying to influence you to
force you to control you and that makes me
feel uncomfortable

Sandro agrees by a nod of his head and indicates that he understands very

well Nevertheless he doesnt move Several agonizing moments go by in which
they both remain silent and still looking at the hotel across the way Then
tossing away his cigarette Sandro finally walks off and goes into the hotel

Left alone Claudia strolls along for a few steps She sees a letter box up
against a building and deposits a postcard she had been carrying with her
She remains there for a moment watching a parade of ants crawling along the
wall ending up who knows where They come and go scurrying up and down in
vast numbers incredibly busy Then Claudia turns away and starts pacing back
and forth stopping from time to time behind townspeople who mill about in
the streets she pays them no heed Several young men pass by and turn around
to look at her They are obviously the towns dandies Circling around her
they exchange suggestive comments to one another Even among the women
Claudia arouses a certain curiosity But she remains totally unaware of it
such is the intensity with which she concentrates her gaze upon the hotel
entrance Suddenly the sound of a shutter being lowered directly behind her
causes her to start and turn around It is a shop being closed Other shops
further down the street are also closing for the day The people in the
streets begin thinning out and it is not long before Claudia is left entirely
by herself In that total solitude the doorway of the hotel emerges like the
mouth of some dark and fearful cavern so much so that Claudia is unable to
keep her eyes fixed upon that spot She turns her head away but her
attention is immediately drawn back again From the darkness of the hotels
hallway she spies Sandro coming out Claudia doesnt wait to see if he is
alone or not for she has only one thought in mind not to let herself be
seen But she doesnt know what to do since there is practically no one else
in the streets and all the shops are closed Then she notices a tobacco shop
still open and she quickly dashes into it She goes up to the counter as she
opens her purse and starts looking for some change

CLAUDIA
Some cigarettes please Do you have any
Nazionali with filters

Her hands tremble as she searches for the money Finally she pays the
storekeeper and immediately lights up a cigarette Suddenly she wheels
about having heard Sandro enter He is alone Throwing away his cigarette
he comes up to her all nervous and excited and they both step out into the
street

As soon as she is outside Claudia leans up against the wall as if she has no
strength left She lets her cigarette fall to the ground and shuts her eyes

SANDRO
What is it Claudia
CLAUDIA

Oh Sandro Im so ashamed of myself so
ashamedI tried to hide myselfI feel so
small I hate myself

SANDRO

Does it please you to say such things

CLAUDIA
Oh no It doesnt please me at all

SANDRO
Then why do you say them

CLAUDIA
Because what Im doing is so ugly Because
if you told me right now Claudia I love
you I would believe you

Sandro is about to say the phrase somewhat jokingly in the hope that it
might calm her but also with a certain amount of seriousness But as soon as
he opens his mouth to say Claudia she places her hand over his lips

CLAUDIA
No Because then Id force you to swear it
Id force you to tell me an infinite amount of
things and that wouldnt be right it
couldnt be right It would be absurd

Sandro tries to calm her with an embrace
SANDRO

Good Its better if it were absurd That would
mean nothing much can be done about it

CLAUDIA
But just think -- the very same things you had
said to her who knows how many times maybe

even just before we left while I was waiting
outside your place

SANDRO
So even if I did say them I was sincere with
her as I am now with you

Moved by Sandros remark Claudia lifts her head and looks deeply into his
eyes The statement reveals him as being someone quite different from the
person she had imagined him to be and at the same time it opens up for her
a new way of looking at things Shaking his head and with much tenderness
he says

SANDRO
I have never seen a woman like you who needs
to see everything so clearly

At the sound of a mans voice coming from behind him Sandro turns and sees a
gentleman with two large packages under his arms pointing to a bell-cord
dangling on the side of a door nearby

MAN
Excuse me but would you mind pulling that cord
for me

Sandro pulls the bell-cord and the sound of a bell is heard inside

MAN
Thank you

The door opens and the gentleman quickly steps inside Sandro looks up at the
building

SANDRO
At one time all these houses were convents

He takes Claudia by the arm and pulls her away towards the square then looks
attentively around the area Bathed in the soft twilight the buildings and
the churches bordering the square reveal themselves in all their beauty
Sandro and Claudia climb up the steps of a church building and from there
gaze at the scene Gradually he allows himself to be overcome with
enthusiasm

SANDRO
Look What a fantastic scene What movement
what disorder They were very much concerned
with scenographic effects an extraordinary
sense of liberty

There is a moment of silence during which he continues to look at the scene
before him Then giving voice to a sincere thought he exclaims

SANDRO
Really Ive got to stop this business with
Ettore I would like to go back and start

working on my own projects again You know I
had many ideas

CLAUDIA
And why did you drop them

SANDRO
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate
for the construction of a school It took me
only a day and a half to finish it and I got
paid six million lire Ever since then Ive
been doing estimates for other peoples
designs

Claudia looks at him as if she were about to render judgment and Sandro
becomes aware of it

SANDRO
Why are you looking at me like that

CLAUDIA
Im sure youd be able to design some very
lovely things

SANDRO
I dont know about that And then whos
interested in beautiful things nowadays

The last words are spoken with a deep sense of sadness Sandro avoiding
Claudias glance He laughs to himself and for a while remains silent He
takes another look up at the dark outlines of the buildings then turns to
Claudia

SANDRO
Claudia lets get married

CLAUDIA
(astonished)
What Get married

SANDRO
Yes Well get married You and I What do you
say

CLAUDIA
What do I say What can I say No At least
not yet I dont know I cant even think of
it at a time like this Oh but why did

you have to ask me

SANDRO
You look at me as though I had said something
foolish
CLAUDIA
And are you sure you want to marry me Are you
really surethat you want to marry me
SANDRO

Thats why I asked you

CLAUDIA
So Oh how I wish that everything were so
much simpler that people could just come

together by the color of their hair or the size
of their shoes What size shoe do you wear
Size 9 Thats a very lovely size But Im
sorry I wear size 8

Sandro smiles and playfully ruffles Claudias hair She also smiles then
slowly they both head towards the hotel

kk

It is morning inside the Hotel Trinacria Claudia has just had breakfast in
her room and is almost finished dressing It is a rather large room set out
with old pieces of furniture The place is in a state of disarray and the
door leading into Sandros room is wide open Because of the general
disorder Claudia is unable to find her stockings But instead of being
angered by this she appears quite jovial and laughs gaily As she continues
to look for her stockings Sandro appears in the doorway

SANDRO
Are you ready

Claudia comes up to Sandro and gazes upon him with a look of adoration
CLAUDIA

(ironically)
But why am I so infatuated with you

SANDRO
(smiling)
Hurry up now or itll begin to get hot
outside
CLAUDIA
Yes yes yes yes Right away

She starts looking hurriedly around the room again but is still unable to
locate her stockings Suddenly up from the street comes the sound of music
It is a popular tune wild and rhythmic emanating from a publicity truck as
part of some local advertising stunt Claudia is overtaken by the music and
cannot resist the temptation to do a little dance for Sandro Little by
little she starts swaying back and forth to the music Then kicking off her
shoes she begins to dance around the room in her bare feet Sandro looks at
her amused but also somewhat impatient

SANDRO
(leaving)
Okay I understand See you later

Claudia rushes up to the door and feigning an exaggerated attitude of
despair says

CLAUDIA
And you leave me here all alone in this
hotel room

SANDRO

As soon as youre ready you can come down and
catch up with me Ill be waiting for you right
outside on the square

Claudia is in a playful mood and she is anxious to demonstrate her
exuberance

CLAUDIA
(teasingly)
Very well But you must first tell me that when
you go out without me its like going out
without one of your legs Go ahead have a look
around the town all by yourself but youll
have to hobble along on only one leg And you
must also tell me that you are filled with a
great desire to embrace my shadow on the
walls Then you must tell me

(suddenly her tone of voice

changes and she becomes

quite serious)
You must tell me that you love me

Sandro replies with the same good-natured tolerance with which he had been
watching Claudia as she danced her coquettish dance

SANDRO
But you know it already Why must I tell you

CLAUDIA
So you wonder why

Without waiting for him to answer she goes back towards the center of the
room and once again starts looking around for her stockings Sandro begins to
leave

SANDRO
Then Ill see you later

CLAUDIA
Okay In a few minutes

Sandro goes out the door Claudia finally locates her stockings and proceeds
to finish dressing

kk

Sandro comes out of the hotel and crosses over to the sunny square He starts
strolling down along a street which leads to a baroque church that opens up
to a wide flight of stone steps Beyond these steps is a small dead-end
street that runs up against the fatade of a large and magnificent old
building A few feet away from the fatade seated on a bench in the shade is
an old coachman whose horse is standing beside him with its head deep in a
sack of hay

Sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old
building which is closed He rings the bell but there is no answer Then he
notices a time schedule posted on the door indicating visiting hours After
glancing at it he walks over to the seated coachman

SANDRO
Its closed Isnt there any custodian or
caretaker inside

COACHMAN
(apathetically)
Nobody there
SANDRO

But it says its open from 930 to 1030 and
its ten oclock now Thats a fine way to
greet tourists

COACHMAN
Tourists Last year a few Frenchmen came here
and they all walked around in their bathing
suits So they were made to understand that it
was better if they didnt come at all

Sandro shakes his head and is about to say something but he sees the door
opening and a man appears Sandro goes over to him

SANDRO
Are you the custodian

CUSTODIAN
Yes come right in

Sandro enters and finds himself inside a large courtyard of noteworthy
architectural design though somewhat in a state of decay The custodian goes
on his way and Sandro walks further into the courtyard where two young men
are studying the architecture On hearing Sandros footsteps they turn
around for a moment then resume their observation They are in fact young
architectural students busily engaged in taking notes and copying certain
architectural details They do this with an extraordinary interest almost
with a sense of religious zeal Sandro continues to stroll through the
courtyard His footsteps are the only sounds to be heard disturbing the
otherwise absolute silence The two young students exchange words between
each other but they speak in faint whispers almost as though they were
inside a church

Sandro gazes up at the arcades the columns the windows He is obviously
filled with a painful sense of regret resentful and bitter He turns to look
at the two young students who are deep in their studies and ignore his
presence But he is unable to ignore them they plainly annoy him In a
certain sense they humiliate him He turns away and heads towards the exit
walking on the tip of his toes so as not to make any noise Then he goes out
quietly closing the door behind him

kk

In the hotel lobby a maid is cleaning and dusting and at the same time
singing little snatches from a popular romantic tune The hotel manager who
is busy writing something in the register behind the desk looks up and says

HOTEL MANAGER
Go ahead keep right on singing

Disappointed the maid immediately stops singing and the manager resumes
writing But she quickly looks up again as she hears footsteps coming down

the stairs It is Claudia

HOTEL MANAGER

(to Claudia)
Excuse me for interfering but Ive heard about
that girl Here in this place one gets to

know about everything That girl youre
looking for Why dont you try asking at the
youth hostel in Pergusa Almost all the young
girls traveling through here end up there

Claudia is immediately interested to hear this bit of news and is about to
ask for additional information But she is suddenly distracted by Sandro who
enters the lobby at that very moment

CLAUDIA
I was just coming out to meet you How come
youre back so soon

Sandro doesnt answer but merely shrugs his shoulders Then he takes Claudia
by the arm and gently leads her towards the stairway He has a worried
expression on his face and remains absolutely silent as he starts climbing
the stairs As they walk through the corridor Claudia looks at him
anxiously wondering what is wrong

CLAUDIA
Sandro Whats the matter

SANDRO
Nothing

He opens the door to his room and ushers Claudia in As soon as he enters he
takes off his jacket and throws it on a chair Then he walks over to the
window and closes the shutters Then without saying a word he turns to
Claudia grabs her in his arms and squeezes her Claudia smiles and
playfully yells Ouch Then he goes to kiss her but Claudia tries to resist
but doesnt succeed This little struggle stimulates Sandro and is enough to
make him forget all reserve He drags Claudia on to the bed and forces her to
lie down

CLAUDIA
No Sandro Please

SANDRO
Why

CLAUDIA

No reason why

But Sandro hugs her and kisses her again This time Claudia lets herself be
kissed

CLAUDIA
Whats the matter with you

Sandro only responds by kissing her again Then Claudia yields Sandro is
angry and excited as though he wanted to take his resentment out on Claudia

CLAUDIA
Sandro wait a moment just one moment You
seem like an entirely different person

SANDRO
And arent you pleased That way youll have
a new kind of adventure
Wounded Claudia pushes him away with all her might and exclaims

CLAUDIA
What are you saying

SANDRO
I was only joking really Cant I make a
joke And now youve got to tell me why you
dont want to

CLAUDIA
Oh Sandro I want everything you do But

She stops short then turns aside and reaches out to touch his jacket on the
chair looking into the pockets not with curiosity but with a sense of love
Sandro grabs her by the shoulders and forces her to turn around

SANDRO
But what

Claudia remains silent then gets up from the bed and in a subdued tone of
voice says

CLAUDIA
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that
place nearby

SANDRO
Yes she started to but I didnt feel like
staying to listen to what she had to say If we
had to listen to everybody

CLAUDIA
No Sandro We should go Besides we
havent been in touch with anybody Not even
with Annas father We should have at least
sent a wire or telephoned lets be fair he
must be feeling awfully lonely

SANDRO
I dont doubt it But at a time like this were
the least suitable persons to be with him And
as far as telephoning him Who knows where he
is

There is a moment of silence then Claudia starts heading towards the door
CLAUDIA

Come lets go Pack your things and Ill get
mine ready too

kk
It is evening Sandros car is pulling into the town of Taormina on its way
to the San Domenico It comes to a small square and passes by a group of men
and women seated on the steps of an ancient ruin They are dressed in evening
clothes and are laughing and giggling The car turns into the street of the
San Domenico and stops in front of the hotel A porter immediately comes out
and opens the door Claudia and Sandro get out and head towards the small
courtyard that leads into the foyer

The lobby is full of activity and alive with people dressed in formal attire
Claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees the surroundings the
people etc Sandro approaches the reception desk as Claudia walks slightly
ahead anxious to see what is going on The sound of music is heard coming
from one of the halls at the other end of the lobby There is obviously a
party underway further on through a glass partition couples are seen
dancing Suddenly Claudia stops Directly up ahead she notices Patrizia As
soon as she see Claudia Patrizia comes to greet her smiling

PATRIZIA
Well Im looking for somebody else and who do
I find but you

Claudia smiles and they both kiss each other on the cheek

CLAUDIA
How are you

Instead of answering Patrizia takes Claudia by the hand and leads her over
to a bench along the side of the wall and sits down Claudia remains
standing somewhat annoyed by the crowd of people around her

CLAUDIA
Shouldnt we try to find a quieter place

PATRIZIA
Quieter Oh yes of course

Patrizia rises and leads Claudia out to a terrace that overlooks the entire
bay which is dotted with lights Claudia takes in the view but her attention
is still focused on Patrizia She waits from one moment to the next to have
questions thrown at her but Patrizia remains silent So Claudia turns around
and looks at her as though to say Come on say what you have to say and
lets get it over with But Patrizia smiles at her sweetly and only murmurs

PATRIZIA
You look so wonderfully tanned

Claudia feels relieved and presses Patrizias hand almost with a sense of
renewed friendship Sandro appears from behind the glass partition and comes
out on the terrace to greet Patrizia

PATRIZIA
And heres Sandro
(he kisses her hand)
Why dont you two go upstairs and change

SANDRO
Yes we will
They leave the terrace and go through one of the halls towards the corridor
that leads to the rooms Claudia walks ahead with Patrizia and Sandro
following slightly behind The hall is still packed with people

PATRIZIA
Did you manage to find good rooms

SANDRO
They didnt seem too good

PATRIZIA
You should have told Ettore He always manages
to get what he wants

SANDRO
Ettore must be fed up with me by now

PATRIZIA
Oh no not at all And then you know very well
that hell forgive you anything just as long
as you admit to him that youre a worse driver
than he is

Claudia looks at Sandro assured by Patrizias reply She remains thoughtful
for a moment then asks Patrizia

CLAUDIA
How do you manage to put up with all this
confusion You always said people bore you

PATRIZIA
You shouldnt always take me seriously
Actually Im used to it by now First my
mother and now my husband both of them are
like dynamos

SANDRO
Your mother

PATRIZIA
Yes even I had a mother She was part
Austrian but she was still my mother My
childhood was like a tennis match they
bounced me back and forth here and there

CLAUDIA
My childhood instead was a very sensible one

PATRIZIA
What do you mean by sensible

CLAUDIA
It means being without money

Patrizia and Sandro burst out laughing and Sandro reaches out and ruffles
Claudias hair They have arrived in front of a room that is situated on the
ground floor and are greeted by a hotel clerk who is waiting for them with
keys in hand The door is already open and Claudia is about to enter

PATRIZIA
See you soon then

Sandro nods yes and Claudia waves so long as Patrizia takes her leave
Claudia enters the room behind the clerk and Sandro follows Claudia stops
in the middle of the room as the clerk goes through his various duties with
professional exactitude he turns on the lights draws the window curtains
checks to see if there are enough hangers in the wardrobe then finally opens
the door to the adjoining room into which he disappears All his movements
seem completely automatic

SANDRO
(commenting under his breath)
You see Just like a robot

Then Sandro enters the adjoining room where the clerk has in the meantime
turned on all the lamps and performed all the other little duties Sandro
starts to undo his tie Claudia remains standing in the middle of the room
listening to all of Sandros movements in the other room A knock is heard at
the door of Sandros room and Sandro is heard saying

SANDRO
Come in

A few seconds later the porter also enters Claudias room with her baggage
She opens the valise and starts taking out her nightgown and other
necessities Her gestures are slow and imprecise because fatigue has overcome
her Several moments pass and Sandro appears at the door in his pajamas

CLAUDIA
Sandro listen Try not to get yourself too

involved tomorrow

SANDRO
Arent you going to change

CLAUDIA
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore

Sandro shrugs his shoulders without apparently giving much thought to
Claudias statement He goes into the bathroom saying

SANDRO
Sure thats what I said

The sound of the shower running is heard

SANDRO
Wow its ice cold

Claudia goes up to the door adjoining the two rooms and stops at the doorway
of the bathroom that is situated between the two rooms

CLAUDIA
Sandro Im not coming down

SANDRO
Why

CLAUDIA
Im too sleepy

SANDRO

Sleep is something one must learn to overcome
I learned how to do it when I was a child I
never slept And I had friends who even slept
less than I did The one who went to bed first
paid a penalty And we really didnt do
anything After seeing a movie wed go to a
cafe and discuss things for a while then
wed sit down on a bench somewhere listen to
some drunkard watch them putting up posters
or manifestoesor look at the sheep passing
by or go for a stroll around the market
place Or else wed go and wake up some girl
in the neighborhood by standing in front of her
window and calling out her name

Claudia has been listening to Sandro with her head leaning against the door
jamb her eyes closed As soon as Sandro stops she goes back to her bed and
starts undressing Sandro comes out of the bathroom wearing a bathrobe and
going over to Claudia says in an affectionate tone

SANDRO
Youre that sleepy eh What time do expect to
get up tomorrow

CLAUDIA
Late very late

Claudia disappears into her bathroom and Sandro returns to his room After a
while his voice is heard

SANDRO
Did you know that when I was a boy I wanted to
be a diplomat Can you imagine that Me a
diplomat Its strange but I never thought Id
be rich I saw myself living in a rooming house
full of geniuses

Claudia has slipped into her nightgown and returned to her room Sandro is
heard clearing his throat and then continuing

SANDRO
Instead I have two apartments one in Rome and
one in Milan As far as genius goes its a
habit Ive never formed What do you think of
that

Sandro reappears at the doorway already half dressed Claudia slides into
bed and stretches herself out under the covers
CLAUDIA
I look at things differently But maybe its
best we talk about it some other time Do you
mind turning off that light over there

Sandro turns out the lamp on the table while Claudia closes the main switch
The room is enveloped in darkness Sandro approaches the bed and bends over
Claudia to kiss her

SANDRO
Good night my love

CLAUDIA
Good night Tell me that you love me

SANDRO
I love you

CLAUDIA
Tell me once more

SANDRO
I dont love you

CLAUDIA
(smiling)
I deserve it

Sandro goes towards the door then turns and smiles

SANDRO
Thats not true I love you

He returns to his room closing the door behind him He seems somewhat
meditative as though the little discourse he has just delivered has in some
way touched him deeply He also seems a little sad Then he puts on his tie
and jacket lights up a cigarette and goes to the door

kk

Sandro comes out of his room and walks along through the corridors heading
towards the reception halls down at the other end Other persons are walking
up and down the corridor in both directions

Sandros attention is attracted by the figure of a woman who is coming his
way at a rather quick pace She is wrapped in a tight-fitting evening dress
that emphasizes the various harmonious parts of her body Sandro looks at
her He seems to recognize her but isnt quite sure who it is The girl
passes alongside of him and apparently she too has the same impression for
she gives him a look that lasts much longer than it normally would between
two complete strangers She stops in front of a door but before entering
she casts another glance at Sandro who suddenly recalls that she is the same
woman who had almost provoked a riot in the streets of Messina and who was
forced to take refuge in a mens shop There is a moment of hesitation then
the girl opens the door and disappears into the room Sandro continues on
ahead until he reaches the bar which is still very crowded

Evening clothes of all kinds Shiny silks Jewels dangling from wrists necks
and ears that are either white or bronzed by the sun Shoes of silver or
lustrous black Headdresses of many women -- high cropped or short and
bobbed Men with hair well groomed but also frequently mussed A vast
tumultuous wave of people all wealthy and respectable talking laughing and
carrying on as though the whole wide world was right there and everybody in
it was like them

Snatches of witticisms Faces of passing people Hands reaching out for
glasses The expressions on the face of the barman smiling and indifferent
The sad sullen face of the cloakroom attendant The dumbfounded look on the
face of a thirteen-year-old elevator boy

Sandro feels very much at home in this milieu One thinks so little forgets
so easily And things are so conveniently ignored beginning with ones own
self Sandro moves through the crowd here and there Standing next to the
orchestra is a girl in black pants singing strange songs in a soft
suggestive voice

Sandro encounters Ettore As soon as he sees Sandro Ettore comes over and
places an arm around his shoulder almost in the form of an embrace

ETTORE
Well finally Come Ill introduce you to my
friends

SANDRO
I want to take a look around first Ill join
you later

ETTORE

Say I hope its understood that starting
tomorrow morning Ill need to have you around
If you dont give me some figures to work with
how can I proceed

Sandro agrees with a nod of his head But he is thoughtful and somewhat
saddened As Ettore returns to his friends with whom he had been speaking and
laughing Sandro looks at him almost with a sense of rage

Then he goes back to the bar and orders something to drink He is not aware
that the girl from Messina is just a few yards away and is watching him She
is extremely tanned extremely voluptuous and extremely beautiful

Sandro moves away from the bar with the glass in his hand He passes in front
of a semi-dark room and takes a peek inside a television set is turned on
but nobody is watching it Sandro is restless He comes to a terrace and
stops to look down at the illuminated docks below The headlights of cars
passing by fan out across the road that runs along the shore of the sea With
an angry gesture Sandro finishes his drink gulping the whiskey down in one
fast swallow He squeezes the empty glass in his hand as though he had wanted
to crush it
kk

The early rays of dawn are faintly seen coming through a window at the far

end of the corridor

CLAUDIA
Patrizia Patrizia Wheres Ettore

PATRIZIA
I imagine he must be inside sleeping

CLAUDIA
Would you please see if Sandro is with him

Hes not in his room Im sorry to disturb you

Patrizia gets up out of bed and goes into the adjoining room

She returns to

PATRIZIA
Ettore

ETTORE
What is it

PATRIZIA

Nothing nothing at all I was just looking
for Sandro

ETTORE
And you expect to find him in here Go and ask
Claudia

PATRIZIA
Yes yes of course

her room

CLAUDIA
Patrizia Im afraid

PATRIZIA
More or less we are all afraid Especially at
night

CLAUDIA
Im afraid that Anna has come back I feel
shes back and that theyre together

PATRIZIA
But whats gotten into you We would have
known Sandro must be out in the garden
somewhere taking a breath of fresh air or

watching the break of dawn It would be a lovely

surprise indeed if he turned out to be the
sentimental type

Claudia sinks down into a chair weak and exhausted

Claudia comes rushing out of her room and runs over to
Patrizias door She knocks then without waiting for a response

she enters
PATRIZIA
Now listen For Gods sake try not to let
yourself become obsessed with that idea Go to
your room and get back into bed

CLAUDIA
Just several days ago the thought of Anna
being dead would have made me sick And now I
dont even cry Im afraid she might be alive
Everything is becoming so damned simple and
easy even to deprive ones self of pain and

suffering

PATRIZIA
You should never wish to get melodramatic over
anything

CLAUDIA
Yes youre right Im sick and tired of being
like that

Claudia gets up and leaves the room She continues walking down along the
corridor checking here and there But the hotel is deserted There are still
a few lights on in the reception hall but not enough to illuminate the
place adequately Finally she reaches the main hall and stops The only
signs of last nights party is a certain disorder in the placement of the
armchairs and ashtrays filled with cigarette butts Even the main hall seems
completely deserted But all of a sudden Claudia becomes aware of something
moving on a sofa at the far end of the room She takes a few steps walking
silently over the thick carpet so as to get a better look There seems to be
a slight movement among what appears to be a jumbled pile of male and female
clothes partly hidden from view by the back of the sofa Claudia goes up
still closer because she is not able to see clearly what or who it is Only
that she has the impression of having seen that suit before A mans suit
She is now able to distinguish what it is a couple embracing and kissing

Claudia approaches still closer She is now just a few steps away Little by
little as she advances her face takes on such a painful look of
astonishment that she appears almost petrified She hesitates and bumps up
against a little table that makes a small noise The couple on the sofa come
out of their embrace and look up The man is Sandro the woman is the girl
from Messina Sandro looks at Claudia as though he were filled with terror
The girl instead seems quite amused Claudia remains for a moment staring
at them as if she cant believe her own eyes and is incapable of making any
move Then she abruptly turns away and starts running She runs through the
main hall the reception room the courtyard and out into the street

There is not a soul to be seen No sound The day is breaking clear and
serene

Claudia comes over to a bench with its paint all peeling off but she doesnt
sit down Transfixed and with her eyes almost wide open she stares out at
the sea and at the waves which are also a mystery unto themselves

Footsteps are heard approaching from behind but Claudia doesnt even bother
to turn It seems that nothing could distract her from that painful state of
shock which is written all over her face A young laborer in overalls

carrying a small bundle under his arm passes by glancing at her with a look
of curiosity He walks a few paces ahead then turns around to look at her
again as though she were some kind of strange creature

The sound of footsteps dies down in the distance and everything is silent
once more There is only the gentle lapping of the waves as they roll up
against the shore Claudia is completely oblivious to the scene Several
birds swoop down emitting their small cries A sudden but almost
imperceptible sea breeze ripples Claudias hair

Other footsteps are heard approaching slow heavy Claudia is still not
stirred from her thoughtful trance-like state The footsteps come to a halt
directly behind her It is Sandro He appears thoroughly crestfallen He
doesnt even have enough courage to look at Claudia His face is worn and
disfigured like that of a tired old man And he lets himself fall limp onto
the bench They both remain completely motionless without looking at each
other And detached Claudia standing Sandro seated Behind them the
skeleton of cement Further off the sea

Gradually Claudia turns her head towards Sandro Her eyes are filled with
tears She looks down upon him as though he were something that greatly
pained her She moves up closer to the bench Sandro doesnt budge an inch
Claudia reaches out to him with her hand then slowly gently and with an
overwhelming sense of desperation she caresses his hair
