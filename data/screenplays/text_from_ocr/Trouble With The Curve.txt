The sound of PEEING Its not steady Sudden bursts hitting
the water Followed by periods of long silence Then a few
drops Then GUS VOICE

GUS VOICE
I could paint the goddamn house
before you decide to cooperate

INT GUS APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING
GUS LOBEL stands over his toilet Hes late 60s and has

seen and heard 1t all -- and then some Looks down to the
source of his trouble

GUS
Just takin your sweet-ass time arent
ya another body part gettin

temperamental Wish I could leave you
here and come back when youre
through You holdin some sort of
grudge 1s that it Think its my
fault you havent seen much action
since the Carter Administration Its
not as easy as you think it is

INT LIVING ROOM - MORNING

The apartment is drab Built in the early seventies No
charm Aside from a new big-screen TV the rest of the
furniture is old and wouldnt bring much in a yard sale

Essentially awake Gus comes from the bathroom On his way to
the kitchen when he CRACKS his knee on the coffee table
Grabs it in pain

GUS
Ahh
(to the table)
You son of a bitch Stay the hell out
of my way

Pulls the coffee table across the room out of harms way We
see that the table isnt alone Joining other exiled pieces
that have collided with Gus

He continues to the kitchen Stacks and stacks of newspapers
are piled everywhere Not full papers Just the sports
pages Everything from weeklys to high school journals

Theres a small formica table and not much else One chair
rests at the table Not expecting company
He opens the refrigerator A jar of instant coffee some
beer a half-smoked cigar and a single slice of pizza greet
him The pizza sits on the cold rack not covered or wrapped
Reaches for it

GUS (CONTD)
Breakfast of goddamn champions

Stands at the refrigerator eating

He goes to a cupboard and pulls a bottle of Vodka Pours some
into a small bowl

He sticks his hand in his mouth pulls out an upper bridge-
plate Sets the teeth in the bowl Takes a tooth brush and
scrubs

Satisfied he puts the teeth back in his mouth Takes a hit
off the bottle Gargles swallows

EXT BASEBALL FIELD - ATLANTA - DAY

Two college teams play ball under the warm Georgia sun
Clusters of spectators are speckled through the stands

A few old-timers SMITTY MAX and LUCIOUS sit with Gus
behind home plate Lucious is black Theyre casual and
relaxed like theyve seen this a thousand times They have
Theyre scouts

SMITTY
Jack Benny Jack Paar Carson they
were funny

LUCIOUS
Carson wasnt funny Never made me
laugh

Lucious winks at Gus

SMITTY
Johnny Carson was the funniest guy on
television

GUS

It was the writers Smitty They were
funny Johnny wasnt funny

LUCIOUS
Tell you who wouldve been a better
host Arsenio
Gus
Now he was funny

SMITTY
You think that Arsenio Hall 1s funnier
than Johnny Carson

LUCIOUS
No comparison

Lucious pumps his arm does annoying Arsenio impression

LUCIOUS (CONTD)
Woof Woof Woof’

Gus and Max join in

GUS MAX
‘Woof Woof Woof

Smitty watches his three old friends woofing
amused

LUCIOUS
(laughs)
Gets me every time Arsenio 1s a
comic genius

GUS
Id have to agree with you on that
one

SMITTY

I know what youre doing Youre
trying to piss me off Its not gonna
to work Not this time

Lucious Max and Gus roar

Hes not

Gus puffs on his three day old cigar Looks out at what he

came for The pitcher

Pitch after pitch sails into the catchers mitt

From Gus

POV the ball begins to get blurry Not quite in focus Gus

rubs his eyes It doesnt help He gets up

GUS
Well happy fishing boys

SMITTY
Where you going Gus Dont you wanna
see what hes got
INT SCHWARTZ ROSENBLOOM AND WATSON -

GUS

each have a folder on her studying various papers and

documents

In unison

SCHWARTZ

Im sure you know theres too many
lawyers and not enough jobs

walters and waitresses in this town

MICKEY
Thats why I was top of my class every
year I dont ever want to know what
kind of dressing you want on your
salad

She recovers
They share a polite laugh then back to the papers

ROSENBLOOM
If we were to make you an offer when
could you start

MICKEY
Yesterday

ROSENBLOOM

WATSON
The adjustment from law school to the
life of a working lawyer is quite

transition Mr Watson I traveled a
lot as a kid Im used to change

SCHWARTZ

off her face or adjust the collar on her blouse he cares for
her softly wiping dust and dirt off the stone

A glass of beer is next to the grave Gus drinks from the

bottle and eats a pastrami sandwich Its lunch with his
wife A ritual hes shared with her every month since she

EXT TURNER FIELD - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Home of the Braves

INT TURNER FIELD - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

VINCE FREEMAN 45 heads a meeting Vince 1s the General
Manager of the Braves On one side of him sits PETE KLEIN
50 Director of Scouting Petes sturdy no-frills

Across the table is PHILLIP SNYDER Associate Director of
rd Scouting Armani clad Razor sharp 35

In their own ways Pete and Phillip represent baseballs past
and present

Phillips fangers fly across a laptop inputting and receiving
information

PHILLIP
Tremendous absolutely fucking
tremendous Jones playing up in
Waterloo went three-for-four again

PETE
Wasnt he just arrested on assault
charges

PHILLIP

Whats a couple of assaults when
youre hitting 350 Based on his
current average the computer tells me
hes ready to move to Double A

PETE
You and that computer

PHILLIP
Current Pete Gotta be current
These new programs are a vital tool in
evaluating todays talent

Vince looks at Phillip impressed

VINCE
What about the kid in Chattanooga

PHILLIP
Struggling Gus Lobel signed him

PETE
Hell be fine Gus could spot talent
from an airplane

PHILLIP
I dont know I was going over roster
reports from the last four years
Lobel only signed three kids

PETE
So This isnt a grocery store
Cant just go 1n and get what you
want Maybe there hasnt been a lot
out there Maybe his territorys
thin

territory
VINCE

Mr Turner will be here for the
combine I dont want any surprises

PETE
Wait a minute Were sending one of
the best scouts the organization has
ever had Youre talking about the
guy who signed Henry Aaron for Gods
sake Gus is a legend

PHILLIP
Pete with all due respect thats old
news You think anyone really cares
who signed Hank Aaron The games
changed Its so much bigger now
Its global Theres millions of
marketing dollars to be considered
We need a staff that can relate to
these kids on all levels Who can
talk-the-talk We all hate to face
it but he might be ready for pasture

VINCE
Think hell retire

PHILLIP
We carry the option on his contract
Hes got six months left

PETE
For Christ sakes Gus Lobel can do the
job If he proves me wrong Ill take
full responsibility but until then
lets worry about the players not
when Gus retires

EXT GUS APARTMENT GARAGE - EARLY EVENING

Gus is having trouble backing his time-worn 65 Mustang
convertible out of the garage Hes dangerously close to the
side wall

GUS
Son of a bitch did a bunch of goddamn
midgets design this garage
Frustrated He punches it SCREECH The car squeezes
through Taking a chunk of door jam with it
INT MUSTANG - EARLY EVENING

game

GUS
Gotta eat dont you They got food
there Close your eyes Pretend
youre in Paris

Like hes wearing blinders He drives Mickey Burns

EXT BASEBALL FIELD - MACON GEORGIA - NIGHT

Definitely the minor leagues Local advertising signs plaster
the beat-up outfield wall

A DRUNK CLOWN leads the crowd through a pathetic version of
the wave

At bat is TOMMY CLARK 18 The pitcher winds and throws
Tommy swings and misses

Gus
Come on Tommy

Tommy looks up to the stands and sees Gus and Mickey Digs
into the batters box The pitcher looks in for the sign
winds and fires

Tommy takes a big swing Connecting with nothing but air
Game over

GUS (CONTD)
A nice fat fastball and he missed it
Christ when I scouted him he could
hit that like it was T-ball

The crowd moans as the players walk off the field The clown
makes a futile attempt at one final wave but tumbles over in
the process

Flops on his back Lets out a whale-like BELCH and passes
out People step over him Nothing out of the ordinary
EXT LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

A handful of friends and groupies greet players emerging from
the locker room Gus and Mickey wait for Tommy He walks
over

TOMMY

How long before they release me
GUS

Youre in a slump No big deal
TOMMY

Im in a coma
GUS

Listen to me I signed you because
you can hit Ive never seen a
quicker bat than yours A quick bat
is whats gonna to get you called up

TOMMY
I dont know what my problem is Just
not concentrating like I should

MICKEY

MICKEY (contd)
» Youll have to excuse Mr Social
Graces

GUS

MICKEY

TOMMY

MICKEY
Traveled much

He stammers a bit Uncomfortable

TOMMY

MICKEY

TOMMY

Yeah Theyd drive down but
moneys kind of taght

Mickey looks at Gus He strikes a match to his cigar

GUS
You just worry about baseball Tommy
Ill take care of getting your parents
down to see you

TOMMY
(excited)
Really That would be great

Gus affectionately puts his arm around Tommy Mickey pretends
not to notice The three of them walk down the tunnel out of
the stadium

INT GUS APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

In T-shirt and boxers Gus sits at his table enjoying one of
his true pleasures -- coffee the sports page and a cigar

He makes a half-hearted attempt to tip his ashes into an
ashtray But misses every time

Gus uses a large magnifying glass to read Through the glass
we see a headline BO GENTRY DOES IT AGAIN With a pen he
circles it

A knock on the door

PETE (0S)
Gus you home

GUS
Its nine oclock in the morning
Where the hell else am I gonna to be

Gus slips the magnifying glass under the paper Pete lets
himself in

PETE
Guess that means I can come in
GUS
You hungry Breakfast1ll be here any
minute
PETE
Busy
GUS

Just doin’ my homework

Gus motions Pete to a stack of papers

GUS (CONTD)
Have a seat

Pete glances at the headline hes about to sit on Stares at
all the papers All the hours and hours and hours Gus puts
into his work Shakes his head in wonder

PETE
Gus did you ever think in a million
years that computers would be a part
of the game

GUS
People using computers dont know a
goddamn thing about this game

PETE
Did you know that we can access from a
data base all the high school and
college rosters in a designated
region That a computer can down-load
stats of any player anywhere Isnt
that something You wouldnt have to
waste your time with all these papers

GUS
Not wasting my time I enjoy it

PETE
Therere special programs that can
calculate a players stats and based
on the competition hes faced tell
you whether or not hes ready for the
next level Can you amagine that

GUS
What else can computers tell you
When you should scratch your balls

PETE
I dont like it either but theyre
becoming a part of our business
Christ even I got one

GUS
No computer can tell me if a kid can
play If he has good instincts if he
ean hit the cut-off man if he can hit
behind the runner Aint no computer
anywhere gonna tell you that

Pete stares at his old friend Knows he right

PETE
So whatd you think about Bo Gentry
If we do get a shot at him the front
office would love to show him off at
the combine

GUS
Lets see if he can play before we
worry about the dog and pony show

PETE
Spotlights really on this kid Gus

DOORBELL RINGS Gus crosses to the living room Pete with
him He opens to DANNY the delivery guy

DANNY
Morning Mr Lobel Canadian bacon
extra anchovies and chili peppers

Danny lifts the pizza lid to show Gus
GUS
A goddamn work of art Whoever said
breakfast is the most important meal
was a genius Danny

DANNY
And heres your newspapers

Places a bundle on the porch

Gus opens his wallet Things get blurry He cant
distinguish the bills Hands Danny some money

GUS
Keep it

Danny passes him the pizza Starts to walk away Looks at
the money Stops

DANNY
Mr Lobel did you mean to give me
fifty

Embarrassed Gus tries to cover

GUS
Hell no Just testing you Danny-boy

Danny hands him back the money

GUS (CONTD)
Youre a good kid Take an extra five
for yourself

He does

Danny leaves Pete looks at Gus They walk back through the
living room

Pete sees the furniture pushed to one side Making an extra
wide path to the kitchen

PETE
Is this some sort of new style Im not
up on

GUS

Rearranging Havent had a chance to
put things back

They go into the kitchen Gus notices Pete staring at him

GUS (CONTD)
What the hell you lookin at
PETE
Gus are you alright
GUS
Fine
PETE

We go back a long time If something
were wrong youd tell me wouldnt you

GUS
Sure

PETE
Because if for any reason youre not
up to it we could send someone from
Charlotte It might be easier on you

GUS
I dont need easier

Pete treads lightly

PETE
Gus have you thought about what you
might do when your contracts up

GUS
Sign another one For more money

PETE
Ever think about retiring

GUS
For what This is what I do

Gus looks at Pete Direct

GUS (CONTD)
Whats this about

Pete searches for the right words

PETE
Gus theres just a lot of pressure
right now Phillip has Vinces ear
Pumping him full of ideas Telling
him we need new blood Young new
blood

Gus smiles Trying to shrug off the terror that shoots
through ham

GUS
Oh he doesnt have a lick of sense
Theyll figure that out soon enough

PETE
Theyre worried about Tommy Clark in
Chattanooga

GUS

Theres no need to worry hes gonna
hit Boy just needs to see his momma
Im puttin in the paperwork to send
for his folks

Pete sighs This isnt your typical baseball request

PETE
Gus you know this game better than
most And Ill always go to bat for
you I just want to make sure youre
up for it

Gus eats his pizza Casual

GUS
Sure youre not hungry

Pete looks at him Knows this conversation has gone as far as
atll go

PETE
No Im not hungry
(beat)
Hows Mickey
GUS

Interviewed at Schwartz Rosenbloom
and Watson The best firm 1n Atlanta
Thinks she has a good shot

PETE
Well tell her I said hey

Pete walks out Gus watches him leave He stops eating

Just sits there Still Then POUNDS the table

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

A 65 Cadillac Convertible is parked on the side of the road
In a nearby field a group of young kids are playing baseball

Johnny sits on the hood watching

KID 1
I get to be Cal Ripken

KID 2
So Cal Ripkens bald

KID 1
Who are you gonna be

KID 2
The Big Unit’

Big Unit throws to Cal Ripken who fouls it off

Johnny talks into a small hand held tape recorder announcing
the game

JOHNNY
The Big Unit winds and delivers He
comes with a nasty slider that Ripken
just barely gets a piece of Cals
been in a slump of late going one for
his last nineteen

Johnny stops the recorder Thinks for a moment Turns the
recorder back on

JOHNNY (CONTD)

a nasty slider that Ripken just
barely gets a piece of Cals in such
a bad slump he couldnt hit the beach
with a beach ball

Johnny likes that better nods his approval Big Unit throws
another pitch that Cal hits into the outfield

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Here comes the 0-1 Ripken hits a shot
to center

The ball goes between the outfielders legs Johnny jumps off
the car calling the play

JOHNNY (CONTD)
The outfielder cant make the play
The ball goes under his glove and is
rolling all the way to the wall

Cal (the little kid) is flying around the bases heading for
home

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Rapken is rounding third hes
going to try to come all the way home
Here comes the throw safe Hes
safe He beat the tag The Orioles
win the game

Johnny clicks off his recorder Looks to see all the kids
staring at him like hes some kind of crazy man

Dark The only light coming from the big-screen ESPN 1s on
but theres no sound

Gus stands in the shadows Contemplating a wall filled with
photos Pictures of Gus with famous ballplayers From Mays
to Mantle Drysdale to Koufax

Pictures of Mickey run a very close second Grade school
through college One picture stands out A very young Gus
with a woman They hold a newborn

He shifts from picture to picture gazing at his past
Finally moves away Wanders through the apartment Feeling
its emptiness

An old man who suddenly feels alone Goes to the
refrigerator Reaches for the security of a beer can

T ) He sits in his Barcolounger sipping his Bud Ever so softly
he starts to sing A song from the past a song he enjoyed
Gus
(quietly)

Rollin’ in my sweet babys arms

mill train gets back gonna roll in
my sweet babys arms

STEVE
Why do they bury lawyers under twenty
feet of dirt Because deep down

Mickey doesnt find them all that funny Laughing
halfheartedly at best
STEVE (CONTD)
Whats the difference between a dead
dog in the road and a dead lawyer in

the road Theres skid marks in front
of the dog

A roar Mickey forces a smile Steve looks at her

STEVE (CONTD)

He got it off the end of the bat

GUS
The Sisters of the Blind could hit it
out with those goddamn aluminum bats
Sweet spots as big as a mules ass

percent of the kids signed ever get

Gus
Listen loud and clear to what Im
tellin’ you A lot of young scouts

him because they think hell learn

next to impossible to fix Its a
rhythm thats created at birth like

something of myself In addition to

powers I can be an asset creatively
Im giving the marketing department my
slogan free of charge How huge is
that ‘Im giving you a headache’
could be bigger than ‘Just Do It’

Gus looks at Bo Would really like to slap him

GUS
Mr Gentry Ive been in baseball over
fifty years Ive seen a lot of
Players Youre son has among
other things talent And if he
accepts a scholarship to play in
college he can further develop his
game and get a good education free of
charge But at this point I think
its a mistake to forgo college and
sign a minor league contract I cant
speak for the other teams but the
Braves wont be drafting him
