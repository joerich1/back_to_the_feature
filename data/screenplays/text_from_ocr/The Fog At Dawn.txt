strenuous effort underwater

FADE IN

EXT UNDERWATER - DAY

MARIO 12 skeletal in figure is struggling through cycles
of bubbles

Suddenly two successive MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS can be heard in
the surface

A strong undercurrent SWOOSHES It sweeps the boy violently
as the water runs RED WITH BLOOD

The FLAPPING of a flag mixes with DISTANT ARTILLERY
EXPLOSIONS and AIR RAID SIRENS

FADE IN

EXT THE DOCK - DAY
The HINOMARU the Japanese Imperial flag stands on the
deck of one of the destroyers The half torn symbol shakes

violently amidst the strong HOWLING wind

The air is smoggy and the water murky
Smoke is billowing and fire is burning from every direction
in the buildings in the ships and in the wharf

On the harbor are tightly tucked cruisers and destroyers
along with commercial ships and fishing trolleys

On the dock men of the Japanese Imperial Navy scurry to
perform their duties on and off the ships

INT INSIDE A MILITARY TRUCK - MORNING

(meaning soldier) and ken (meaning law) in red It is

the official seal of the Kempeitai the dreaded Japanese
military police

yellow stripes It is known as Rikugun Shosa a rank as
Major in the Imperial Army

KAITO HARADA 35 a bony and lanky officer wears his Socho

uniform with pride He sits emotionless on the front seat

His face catching occasional light as the truck moves along

EXT THE DOCK - DAY

MOVING A ROARING JAPANESE ARMY TRUCK approaches it spews
dust from it’s tracks It heads towards a platoon of

soldiers who are loading supplies on a patrol craft

The engine blows smoke as it stops in front of them
From the platoon a Japanese DISPATCH OFFICER greets Harada
on the side of the vehicle

Note This dialog is in Japanese with subtitles

DISPATCHER
(saluting)
Major Harada

HARADA
(looking at the craft)
Is that our boat

DISPATCHER

I’m sorry Sir but you can’t board
here You have to go south and take
another one in Lucena

Harada reacts curiously as the DISTANT ROARS of artillery
and it’s impact can be heard and felt

DISPATCHER

Corregidor is under attack and
American ships are blocking the
bay

HARADA
Where is Colonel lyashi

DISPATCHER

He and his men have been ordered to
abandon ship and make a defensive
stand in Intramuros

HARADA
Those are not General Yamashita’s
order

DISPATCHER
It was an order from General
lwaguchi Sir

Harada pauses to think

HARADA

It’s true then we are in
disarrayOkay what are our
instructions

The dispatcher takes out a handwritten message by Colonel
lyashi and hands it over to Harada Urgently he reads it

DISPATCHER

(while Harada is reading)

There’s a platoon waiting to send
you off in the harbor Sir You
must also travel quickthe area
is swarming with guerrillas Take
the Avenida on the 8th it’s the
only road that we have full control
of You will get your instructions
once in Lucena

and puts the paper aside

Harada sticks his head out of the front seat and looks up

HARADA’S POV The air is tainted with smoke

DISPATCHER (OS)
You have to go Sir

The hesitant Harada slowly taps the roof of the truck

signaling the driver to go The truck speeds away

EXT STREETS - DAY

MOVING along the dilapidated remains of an Allied bombing
the truck negotiates it’s way through a chaotic avenue in
Manila

Japanese soldiers on foot are escorting the truck through

the crowd while civilian evacuees litter the streets The

truck HONKS its way through them The soldiers are SHOUTING
orders as they FIRE SHOTS in the air to clear the crowd
CLOSE Amidst the chaos Harada looks on

HARADA’S POV From inside the front seat of the truck

1 A Japanese officer brandishing a pistol SHOUTS at an
elderly couple who cannot get out of the way fast enough

2 A woman is crying on her knees with a dead child in her
arms

3 Shops being looted by both the soldiers and the
civilians

WIDE Carelessly the TRUCK accelerates through the scene

EXT CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY

WIDE A line of refugees fleeing the city congest the road
as the truck finds it’s way out of the capital

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The Japanese truck passes through several treacherous

roads-muddy rough rocky and narrow

EXT THE LUCENA DOCK - DAY
Finally the truck finds it’s way along rows of coconut
trees where the beach can be seen behind it

The makeshift dock is at the end of the road guarded by
platoon of Japanese soldiers

QUICK CUTS Sandbags with machine guns soldiers patrolling
a skinny dog scrounging for something to eat an armed

military vehicle a water buffalo with a cart load of

supplies and a hut serving as a shelter and a communication
center

At the end of the dock is the patrol craft INOUE

The truck approaches and is greeted by a few soldiers

TAKESHI ITO sits on one of the rocks by the shore A 50-ish
doctor in glasses with a short stout structure

The truck pulls in a few meters behind him A cloud of dust

He glances back to see

Harada jumping out of the front seat while his troops
dismount from the back

Note This dialog is in Japanese with subtitles

HARADA
Hurry up Double time Double time

Fifteen soldiers find their spots to form a line in a hurry

SERGEANT YOSHIDA the young commanding officer comes out
from the hut and greets Harada with a bow

YOSHIDA
Staff Sergeant Yoshida at you’re

HARADA
Are you in charge here

YOSHIDA
Yes Sir

HARADA

YOSHIDA

HARADA
Wea civilian thought this is
purely a military mission

KAZUKI

Yes Sir am going with you and we
have to take Dr Ito That was the
order from above and have to make
sure that you do it

Yoshida looks at Doctor Ito He is staring at the sea

Harada feels intimidated

HARADA

trying to threaten me soldier

YOSHIDA
No Sir I’m just carrying orders

HARADA
Where are the papers

YOSHIDA

There are none Sir just know
that those are my orders It should

sandbag is directly aimed at him

HARADA
Very well who is he again

YOSHIDA
Doctor Takeshi Ito You are
responsible for his welfare

HARADA
Do not give me orders again

soldier

YOSHIDA
Sorry Sir but it has to be done
Note Dialog resumes in English unless noted
Harada looks at Yoshida for a moment then moves along his

soldier’s line He walks slowly with a samurai on the left
waist and a pistol on the right

Soldiers stand at attention Their dirty uniforms and rugged
faces show weariness and neglect

MOMENTS LATER

The soldiers move quickly as they load up the Inoue
Yoshida supervises them

Doctor Ito walks pass Harada and gives him a stare Harada
stares back at Ito’s expressionless face A face riddled

with questions and mysteries His blank stare suggests
something unnatural something cold

Harada is the last one to climb on board the craft With the
help of shirtless sailors the INOUE is ready for the sea

Amidst the tranquil scenery the patrol boat’s engine ROARS
The INOUE slowly glides out of the harbor and discreetly
makes it’s way along the coastal route as the Hinomaru

flag is lowered

CLOSE Harada stands at the end of the boat Trickling with
sweat his face is showing signs of concern

FADE OUTFADE IN
EXT OFF THE COAST - DAWN

WIDE Heavy fog settles on the beach Only the top of the
towering coconut trees can be seen a perfect cover for the
discreet INOUE to land

The craft moves slowly towards the shore With engine off
she glides with ease in the calm water

Harada is in the front deck he surveys the area with his
binoculars Yoshida is beside him

HARADA’S POV On the shore flashes of a signal light can be
seen Clearly a coded message to the INOUE

Harada lowers his binoculars

Note This dialog is in Japanese with subtitles

HARADA
The fogvery unusual It’s more
inland than on the sea

YOSHIDA

The natives think that it’s the
ghost of thousandstrying to find
a place to settle

POV FROM THE INOUE The signal light from the shore
continues to flash

HARADA
Theyre right on schedule Prepare

to land

Yoshida acknowledges
SUDDENLY from a distance a BUZZING SOUND of an aircraft
can be heard

Harada looks up First to the sea then inland The BUZZING
gets LOUDER and LOUDER obviously the plane is flying low

Harada points inland

HARADA
There

VROOM the plane flies over the Inoue It is a US Navy
Grumman Avenger

Harada’s head turns his sights follow the plane as it
passes with a strong gust of wind

HARADA
Anti-aircraft He’s coming back
Get Ito somewhere safe

Note Dialog resumes in English unless noted

Yoshida begins CALLING OUT orders as his men scurry along
the deck Anti-aircraft guns at the ready

SILENCE engulfs the air The sailors wait

The BUZZING of the aircraft can be heard again this time
from an undetermined position

Suddenly at 2 o’clock high the diving AVENGER opens fire
with a LOUD BURST of 127 mm machine gun
INT THE PLANE - DAWN

LT HENRY BURROWS 29 a sturdy US Navy pilot is flying
the plane with his two crewmen in the back His thumb
pressing the machine gun trigger

HENRY’S POV A hail of tracer bullets from both his plane
and the anti-aircraft guns of the Japanese can be seen in
patterns The Inoue is getting closer and closer until

a thick FOG hovers between the plane and the boat

The Avenger shifts from machine gun to 20mm cannons BOOM
BOOM BOOM

Its now just a matter of who can hit first over the dense
cloak of the fog

The Inoue responds Black smoke packets from anti-aircraft
fire surrounds the plane

CLOSE ON Henry as sweat trickles down his aviator goggles
Suddenly a succession of CRASHING SOUNDS hit the plane It
rocks and shakes intensively

HENRY
Fuck Fuck Weve been hit boys
I’m losing grip

He turns around to see

HENRY’S POVsmoke from the back cockpit Bullet holes
litter the panels and the lifeless bodies of his crew are
covered in blood

The Avenger tries to pull up but shimmies out of control

The Inoue continues firing until it blows off the right

wing of the plane A trail of smoke comes out as the Avenger
swirls inland and back to the sea where it crashes
EXT THE DECK OF THE INOUE - DAWN

Harada delegates his men as they scamper all over the place
The dead all torn up by the big guns of the Avenger litter
the deck Blood and oil mixes

Mario stops in the middle of the dense tropical flora

MARIO
Wait

Paolo who is trailing from behind almost stumbles

A moment of silence both are edgy

MARIO

tree His parachute entangled with the branches 30 feet

above ground

Henry is leery Anticipating danger he aims his 45 pistol
to where the boys are

With a big cut on his forehead and a bruise on his cheek he
slowly wipes the mixture of sweat blood and oil off his
face Branches CREAK as he moves

Mario’s face turns from fear to exuberance

Okay here we go
Henry breaks off a branch and bites it between his teeth He
grabs the parachute straps above him and with his left
hand quickly cuts it with the knife

A RUSTLING noise follows as he falls feet first on the
makeshift cushion

Henry GRUNTS in pain Trying to prevent himself from
screaming he bites the branch even harder He lays down on
the cushion for awhile Breathing profusely he spits the

shifts his focus from area to area while taking long pauses
to ensure that he covers everything

houses As she moves closer the image becomes apparent

A CORPSE lies in front of her with BUZZING flies circling
around it

DOLORES’ POV The darkest stage of twilight is approaching

DOLORES
Okay let’s secure an area and rest
for a few hours

SANTI
The church looks like a fort

The church is made of stone and concrete from the bottom
midway to the top the rest is structured with hardwood It
is fairly small and can approximately house 100 people

It has a heavy hardwood door measuring nine feet tall and
four small windows on each side It’s roof is made of
corrugated galvanized sheets

INT MANSION LOBBY - DAY
The interior is not as appealing as the outside It is dusty
and shows signs of neglect Walls with painting marks look

like ghosts in the massive space

A sofa set from the 20’s a long hardwood dining table and a
winding stairway contributed to the dullness

A sign of pillaging or evacuation perhaps

Yoshida guides Harada and Ito

They proceed with TAPPING boots on hardwood floor

INT INSIDE TAKAHASHI’S OFFICE - DAY

A quick knock on the door then Yoshida opens it He holds
it for Harada and Ito to enter before closing it behind him

Lieutenant Colonel TAKAHASHI 62 a staunch individual who
is frail due to the pressures of war is seating and writing

a letter on his desk He looks smart in his Imperial uniform
and his stern posture and rigid looks exemplifies pride and
discipline
He looks up at his guests and takes a sip from a glass of
whiskey

Harada Yoshida and Ito greet him with a bow and a salute

31

TAKAHASHI
Have a seat and stay at ease

The visitors sit on the couch while Yoshida stands behind
them A side table full of drinks in the midst of statues of
Catholic saints catches attention

Takahashi takes another sip from his glass

TAKAHASHI
Help yourselves with Filipino rum

A moment of silence Harada is waiting for his superior to
lead the conversation Takahashi looks at him and grins

TAKAHASHI

Major Haradahmmm I’ve fought
tooth and nail to have you here
some against very powerful and
influential people People who
wanted you elsewhere from hunting
down wireless radios to
assassinating important people
(MORE)

32

TAKAHASHI (contd)
There is quite a demand for you out
there

Subtle reaction from Harada

TAKAHASHI

(reclining back in his chair)

This wont be long now Luzon is
falling we lost ManilaMacArthur
has made his way up the
gutterwith his army and minions
of pesky Filipinos
Takahashi looks at Harada as if trying to extract his
opinion on the subject matter Harada is careful

HARADA

We can still hold the Visayas and
Mindanao Sir Up north we can go
to sea and block them south of
Okinawa

TAKAHASHI

Ha With what Major On the north
with the mighty Yamato and an
amateur squadron of tokkotai (note
tokkotai is a kamikaze unit)
bombers and on the south with a
ragtag malnourished army Right
nowit’s just a matter of pure
survival The most primeval
instinct of humansor any animal
for that matter

Takahashi smirks a bit

TAKAHASHI
You do have a family Major We
checked on that

Harada nods

TAKAHASHI

Imagine thisif you and your
family are having a picnica nice
relaxing day by the river when
unexpectedly a grenade explodes a
few feet away

Harada feels like Takahashi is baiting him He waitsand

waitsnot deciding to crack by uttering the next
conversation piece

33

TAKAHASHI

Your instinct is to duck

firstsplit seconds ahead of
thinking about saving your family
You think of surviving first

Harada holds himself to speak almost swallowing his tongue

TAKAHASHI

Nowafter that instinct has been
purgedis where we define our
attitudes and values To be a
savior or a coward a hero or a
traitor

ITO

The Major has a point We (circles
his hand around the room) have
withstood the blast and have
survived Our moral obligation is
to defend Japan bring it back to
it’s feet

TAKAHASHI
(at Harada)
Which leads us to you being here

HARADA
Why am I called here Sir

Takahashi relaxes a bit

TAKAHASHI
You started your heroism this
morning

HARADA
We lost five men It was a close
callif not for the
TAKAHASHI

the fog Things like that happen
everydaywherever you are and
whatever you do There is always
something unpredictable that would
alter everything you expected

HARADA

It settles mostly on the ground
Its unusually denseyet
harmless

34

TAKAHASHI

Its been like that every morning

for three days now What a sight to
behold But maybe we should talk
about the weather some other time
We have some business to attend to
right now (looks at Ito) Doctor

Ito reclines on the sofa He looks at Harada and takes off
his round glasses He wipes them clean while taking deep
winks to refresh his eyes

ITO
(puts his glasses back on)
Unit 731 Majorthat’s our ace

Ito and Takahashi wait for Harada’s reaction There is none
ITO

am part of Doctor Kitano’s team

under General Ishii’s Togo Unit

have you heard of it Major

HARADA
Partly

ITO

We have to be ahead of the
Americans and the Russians on this
matter

HARADA
Biological warfare

Takahashi reaches for the photograph of his family standing
on his desk He looks at it for awhile

TAKAHASHI

More than that Major A chance for
Japan to finally emerge over all
these adversities

HARADA
By unleashing germ warfare It did
not work in World War

TAKAHASHI

said more than that Major Ito
is from the Neuro-Science
department of 731 He is a
geneticist neurologist and an
anatomist (At Ito) Make it simple
Doctor

35

ITO

My pleasure Colonel (turns to
Harada) At 731 one of our projects
is how to enhance the Imperial
Army Not in equipments or weapons
but more onlet’s saybody

spirit and mind This would set our
army above any other in the world
Harada shows a sign of eagerness by changing positions on
his seat

ITO
Through science we believe we have
achieved it

HARADA
Is that why we’re hereMy
soldiers

ITO
No not your soldiers they are
just escorting you on the boat
trip

TAKAHASHI

We already have a company of 85
soldiers on the move as of nowin
the southern part of the island

They are the first to be launched

on this pilot project codename
Operation Baku We have received
reliable reports that the Americans
are going to land in that area

ITO

You see Major this is the
experimental stage of the

operation The recipient company is
composed of the best fighters that
we have Baku was applied to them
four days ago in Manila before they
were dropped off where they are
now The results should be
promising

HARADA
Should be

TAKAHASHI
We don’t have much time in this
war Major We want to implement
this operation fullyto more
soldiers

36

HARADA
How did you implement it

TAKAHASHI

Major you have to remember the
importance of this mission Even
am not allowed to know that

SILENCE

TAKAHASHI
You will accompany Ito on a
mission

HARADA
Whats my objective

TAKAHASHI
Ito’s objective Major Yours is to
make sure he succeeds

ITO

only monitored the soldiers for
36 hours in Manila then they were
dispatched need more time to
study themmentally and
physically Their behaviors and how
they react to various situations
You see in those 36 hours there
are a lot of unanswered questions
that is vital for the success of

this project

HARADA
And what are those questions

ITO

The long term effect of Baku on
the individuals Will it wane
maintain or become stronger And
the duration of it’s effectiveness

TAKAHASHI

(looking at Ito)

Ito will study the progress of The
Baku company We havent heard
from them in the last two days
They are should we say lost in
the jungle

Harada thinks for a moment

37

HARADA

Baku(hesitates to think) the
devourer of nightmares Like the
being in Japanese folklore

ITO

(smiling wryly)

A perfect name for the mission I’m
sure when you were a kid you called
out the Baku to take your
nightmares away

HARADA
Did they engage yet

TAKAHASHI
We don’t know
HARADA
Sono radio contact

Takahashi reclines with no response A brief silence

HARADA
Sir

TAKAHASHI

You are to go to the area with Ito
and a hojin(note a hojin is a
Japanese migrant) She will be your
navigator You will go as

civilians Ito as your friend and

the hojin as your wife You will
bring nothing except a compass
Find the soldiers so the doctor can
monitor them They are under the
command of Lieutenant Daisuke Sato
he knows you

Harada falls silent and ponders for a moment

HARADA

(thinking)

SatoSato Yes remember him
we were in training school
togetherin Keijo and Formosa

TAKAHASHI

The area is crawling with guerrilla
activities It is wise to abandon
your military self and become a
civilian for this mission In the
meantime the rest of your men will

38

TAKAHASHI (contd)
help fortify the city We need all
the help we can get here
HARADA
Of courseSir

TAKAHASHI

Very well that’s why we chose you
Because of your resiliency track
record and good command of English
The Empire depends on you This may
turn the tides of war in our favor

ITO
We only need a few days Major
Four days of utmost secrecy

HARADA
need more details Sir

TAKAHASHI

You will be briefed downstairs by
and travel by foot immediately The
guerrillas have started punitive
raids inside the city and out Be
discreet and smart No forms of
communication will be used When
Ito is satisfied with his findings

you will lead him to a specified
area where somebody will be waiting
to pick you up You have four days

HARADA
Yes Sir

TAKAHASHI

If you don’t to show up in four
days we will consider this mission
a failureand you know what to
do

HARADA
Yes Sir

TAKAHASHI
We have a room for you to rest for
a few hours That will be all you

With machete in one hand and a Thompson on the other he

He turns around to see

With precise timing Emilio swings his machete hitting the
incoming attacker in the chest The DRAGGING SOUND of sharp
iron against ribcage mixes with a GROWL of pain

defiant look stares back at him Without hesitation he
swings the machete at his enemy’s neck The head falls as he

fires a SHORT BURST from his Carbine to finish the jerking
body off

Harada approaches Dolores and William

HARADA

He needs a smokeand he’s
talking
William reaches for his chest pocket and pulls out a pack of
MacArthur cigarettes that says SHALL RETURN He takes a
couple and hands it to Harada

LATER

Ito takes a long drag from the cigarette His wound in the

knee is now bandaged with a TOURNIQUET on the upper leg He
says something to Harada which the former carefully

translates in English

HARADA

In 1939 He was one of the head
researchers at the vivisection
department of Unit 731in
northern Manchuria A research
facility that experiments on
biological and germ warfare

Ito continues his story to Harada who in turn translates it

HARADA

One of usin the vivisection
group felt merciful to one of the
logs that’s what we call our
subjects because the facility is
covered upas a lumber yard We
operate the logs without
anesthesia because it would affect
the growth of certain bacterias
But a doctor injected it to
oneout of mercy He was severely
punished for that

Ito breaths in between drags

From Harada we shift to Ito directly talking

Note This dialog in Japanese with subtitles

65

ITO

It turns out to be a redemption for
that man because the bacteria
thrive oneven with a foreign
substance polluting it With a few
improvisation we have come up with
a germ that rather kill people in
big magnitude tend to fortify

their systems So we applied it to
our troops instead Thus what you
see outside

force With a CRACKING sound it turns 360 degrees His head
hangs from his body held together only by the skin and a
few tissues

slices midway through the assailants forehead He lifts it

and swings again this time on the neck The head spins

away far from where the body falls

Note Dialog resumes in English unless noted

Michiko is completely in a state of shock Her blank stare
and pale face shows signs of resignation

The priest GRUNTS He struggles In a few seconds the water
reaches his neck He is gasping for air while trying to help
the reactionless Michiko stay afloat
Through currents Father Mauricio loses balance as the
turbulent water slowly sweeps them away

MARIO
Padre

DOLORES
(low voice)

No

HARADA
Michiko

Harada SCREAMS He runs straight into the middle of the

river in a futile attempt driven by blind emotions

EXT FLOWING RIVER - DAY

MOVING Traveling at breakneck speed the priest’s head hits

a rock Blood spurts from it Michiko’s face is down in the

water The two float away and disappear with the current

EXT BY THE RIVER - DAY

Harada bows his head as water splashes on his body

Mario who is beside Harada looks at him poignantly

GROWLING GRUNTING and WAILING SOUNDS echo in the
background

William cocks his rifle and looks at Henry and Dolores

WILLIAM
You twogo with the boyI’ll
hold them off

DOLORES
NoI’m staying

HENRY
Fuck it

WILLIAM
Awright

William strides towards the bank then

in a quick flash THUD an ATTACKER lunges at him with
ferocious strength from a spot hidden by humongous rocks

The enemy delivers a strong blow from his fist that
William’s head spins with agitated force He drops like a

log in the stony water

109

Dolores spins her sub-machine gun while firing a BURST The
attacker falls down with multiple hits on the head

Henry slowly walks towards William and picks up his rifle

The light fog sets deeply around them A deceitful moment of
calm no movement nor sound

Harada heads back to the river bank

Slowly the RUSTLE of feet running can be heard again
Sensing an unknown danger looming Harada stops dead in the
river With water on waist level he turns his head and

looks at Mario pistol and sword firmly in both hands

The wait is eternal and no one utters a word They observe
and hope
Henry turns towards where the SOUND is His jaw drops as the
RUSHING SOUND becomes LOUDER

HENRY’S POV ENEMIES are moving Quickly they advance in
scattered positions

HENRY
(whispering to himself)

Oh my God

In a chaotic and savage charge the current wave of
ATTACKERS are relentless

Retreating into the water Dolores and Henry fire at the
them DISSONANT GUNSHOTS

Dolores is picking her shots every bullet matters now
ThenCLICK CLICK CLICK an empty magazine

Henry continues firing until he too runs out of ammo

Dolores takes her last two grenades and hands one to Henry

DOLORES
Stay with me on this okay

He nods at her
Henry and Dolores have nowhere to go With their back

against each other they pull the pins of their
grenadeshands tight on the safety lever

110

HENRY
Whenever youre ready
She nods at him as the ENEMIES rush in increasing numbers

Dolores and Henry are overwhelmed

Henry glances at Dolores for the last time

HENRY’S POV Her face is determined and focused her eyes
watery and beautiful her body vulnerable and fragile

The helpless Dolores looks back at Harada and Mario and with
her last breath she shouts

DOLORES
Get down

Mario looks on horrified

MARIO
(to himself)
Noplease

Tears trickle down Mario’s cheeks

More bodies pile up on them as they slowly release the
grenade in their hands

DOLORES
(shouting louder)
NOW

Harada PUSHES Mario underwater

UNDERWATER (NOTE Same as opening scene) Mario struggles
then two successive MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS can be heard in the
surface Instantly a strong undercurrent sweeps through the

water Mario’s body sways violently from the impact as the

river runs red with blood

A few seconds later he sticks his head out of the water
Spitting water he coughs hard and catches his breath

Slowly blood oozes down his ears

Then a LOUD BUZZING SOUND engulfs the air
Amidst flesh and blood in the water Mario looks around
clueless He shakes his head and clears his ears

MARIO’S POV Blurrythen slowly clearing up he sees
Harada with a bloody shrapnel wound in the shoulder

He is clenching the SWORD with one hand while

111

the other is gripping the pistol and covering his right
ear He grunts in pain as blood trickles down his ears

The LOUD BUZZING SOUND drowns his screams

Suddenly up ahead an ENEMY appears

In anticipation the deaf Harada moves closer to Mario

With only his sight to guide him Harada looks at Mario as
his lips utter

HARADA
(muted)
Go

Mario sees Harada silent scream but he only hears the
BUZZING SOUND Quickly he turns and looks around

MARIO’S POV Big rocks line along the river bank as the
rushing current slams through He shifts his attention to
the middle of the river where a small OPENING free of
rocks is the only way he can swim through

Mario walks with extreme caution towards the middle of the
river One mistake and he can be carried away on a collision
course with the dangerous rocks He stops nervously as the
pressure mounts He looks behind him where
POVthe enemy is rushing at Harada The Japanese officer
flinches as the attacker draws near Quickly he fires the
pistolCLICK CLICKThe gun jams

He throws it away and waits for the charging enemy

With no choice he thrusts his sword at the body then
swings it high to decapitate the assailant All done in one
continuous textbook sequence

More ENEMIES begin to surround him as he staggers in the
river The torrential water slows them down but they

continue with fierce determination

HARADA fights on

With no other option the apprehensive Mario jumps
prematurely into the OPENING

FADE TO BLACK

BUZZING SOUND

EXT FLOWING RIVER RAPIDS - DAY

Fighting to stay afloat and avoiding the dangerous rocks
Mario swims with the current

MARIO’S POV Up and down the violent water

Under water SOUND swathed by muffles sight BLURRED by
murkiness

The sequence continues in a routine as the current carries
him away in a rolling motion

FADE OUTFADE IN

EXT THE RIVER BANK CALM WATERS - DAY

WIDE The sun’s rays sparkles in the calm river The steady
flow of water slowly gushes like a garden stream

The exhausted Mario reaches shallow waters He stands up and
slowly walks to the sandy shore

Dragging his feet and limping he gasps for air as if on
life support system Energy drained from him he bows his

head and collapses on the ground

FADE OUTFADE IN

EXT THE RIVER BANK FARTHER INLAND - DAY
BUZZING SOUND

MARIO’S POV Flashesthe SUN is directly on top of him
Slowly a blurry FIGURE appears and covers the blinding
rays It’s silhouette spins in a whirlwind

A hand grabs Mario’s arm and forces him to stand up

Clearing his eyes Mario looks up to see

MARIO’S POV COMMANDER EDGAR a staunch balding guerrilla
in his late thirties

He hands Mario a canteen of water Mario drinksbottoms
up

Behind Commander Edgar are a band of guerrillas and a throng
of villagers They converge around Mario

spectators CHATTER away

Commander Edgar embraces the exhausted boy

anticipating the landing of the US NAVAL SHIPS on the
horizon

EXT IN A JUNGLE CLEARING - LATE AFTERNOON

The ruthless SUN emits a potent heat The trees rarely sway
from the tranquil windless day The SOUNDS of animals and
wild birds ECHOES in the jungle

The badly wounded Harada is sitting in a seiza position
He faces east where the rising sun a symbol of the Empire
is about to set

From his shirt pocket he pulls out the crumpled and fading
PHOTOGRAH that was given by Father Mauricio

He takes off his shirt and spreads it in front of him
Carefully he lays the photograph on top of it Then he
pulls the Nambu pistol from behind his pants and puts it on
top of the picture

Harada looks at the image of

HARADA’S POVMiho and Seiji Ohayashi a picture almost
destroyed yet beautiful to look at

HARADA
(in Japanese)
Forgive me

He squeezes a damp bandana and wipes his face his stomach
and his shoulder wound with it He GRUNTS a bit
Harada catches his breath and savors the tranquility the
freedom and the honour

He reaches for the SAMURAI beside him and places the tip of
the sword on his left abdomen

A blinding GLINT OF LIGHT reflects quickly
BLADE RESTS ON SKIN
With a smooth thrust he buries the sharp katana into his

body and quickly pulls it right BLOOD slowly flows

114

He GRUNTS for a moment and with all his strength he takes

the bandana and wipes the sword clean RED on WHITE

Catching his last breath he rests the sword along with the
picture and the gun and wraps it with his shirt

Without a sound the disemboweled Harada bows his head and
the hara-kiri ritual is complete He is LIFELESS

SUDDENLY his left foot loses it’s balance

Dizzy he holds on to the railing

Yoshida emerges from behind to help him

YOSHIDA

The groggy Harada nods as Yoshida drags him away

From the door of the office Ito and Takahashi appear

INT OUTSIDE TAKAHASHI’S OFFICE - DAY

Ito is sitting by the sedated Harada as he puts the
injection into his doctor’s bag He sighs

On the other end of the bed Takahashi is looking out the

Takahashi turns around

TAKAHASHI

best candidate for it
