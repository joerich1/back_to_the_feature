FADE IN
INSIDE THE IMAGINATION OF A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY

(A childs imagination is a most powerful force It can transform
kitchen spoon into a spaceshipor a wallpaper design into a
story of adventure and daring)

SURREAL IMAGES float across screen as we attempt to glimpse into
this mysterious world of a childs imaginings

A fairytale city of spires and cathedrals painted in multi-
colored strips accompained by fanciful music denoting a sense

of another world where reality is a question of perspective
Winged beings of various colors fade into screen as they
populate the sky overhead Colorful doll-like townspeople spin
and dance in a town square Horses join the winged beings as they
leap over buildings in play The Sun rises and opens it eyes
shedding orange light and warmth The images have the feel of
cartoonist Windsor McCay and his Little Nemo in Slumberland

INTERCUT

The face of a five year old boy JACK SAWYER as he conjures up
these images There is almost a trance like quality about his
expression He is completely enveloped in this world oblivious
to his “real” surroundings which have not yet been revealed
THE DISTANT VOICE OF HIS MOTHER LILY is heard 0OS

LILY (0S)
JAAACCKK JaaaccckJaaacceckkkkyyyyy

Jack lies on his bed facnig the wallpaper - A COLLECTION OF
FAIRYTALE IMAGES repeated in patterns The image is of a fairy
tale town of castles with a bright shining sun —

Jack hops off his bed yelling

JACK

Instead he plops on the floor and starts immediately playing
with a REMOTE CONTROLLED BRITISH TAXI CAB He drives the cab
out of his toy infested room and exits

INT SAWYER HOME LOS ANGELES - DAY

cU of TOY CAB as he races through the house dodging furniture
jumping carpets while Jack hums a little adventure movie theme

Suddenly THE CAB CRASHES INTO THE TABLE LEG OF A DELICATE
ROSEWOOD TABLE jolting the base and causing the VASE on top of
it to wobble We hear the remote drop to the floor as JACKS
TWO SMALL HANDS come into frame to steady the vase as we hear

LILY (0S)
JACKWhat are you doin
JACK
(boyishly innocent)

Nothing

Picking up the remote he turns drives the cab away from the
table He heads back down a corridor to his room On the way
he passes by A DOOR Jack stops at the door staring up at it
with respect and curiosity

It is the door to HIS FATHERS STUDY his fathers private room

door slowly swings open revealing

AN EMPTY STUDY of books and papers and fatherly things
His mother warns 0S

LILY (0S)

fathers study you hear ne

- JACK
OK

He shuts the door and runs down the corridor lined with pictures
and plants He makes a right into his room and disappears 0S

CAMERA REMAINS ON EMPTY CORRIDOR with THE DOOR TO THE STUDY in

HelloSUSIE Hey When are

OhDid you just feel a tremor

(VOICE FADES as dialogue continues 0S)

Jacks little head mischieviously re-appears popping back

out of his doorway and peering down the corridor Continuing
her phone conversation 0S his mother is now occupied so the
coast temporarily is clear He carries his taxi cab and
remote controls and crosses straight to his fathers office
He reverently reaches for the door knob of the study

CU THE DOORKNOB -

Jack slowly turns the knob the door slowly opens

But Jack is most surprised by what he sees

POV -

INT STUDY

HIS FATHER IS NOW SITTING AT HIS DESK WRITING IN A BOOK
WITH A GOLD PEN He turns to his son and smiles warnly

though his expression tells us he is also burdened with
deep concerns

Jack is a little mixed-up He was sure the room was empty

FATHER
(smiles)
Come here you

Jack forgets the strangeness of his fathers sudden appearance
and rushes to his dads open arms His father hugs as if for the
last time He speaks gently lovingly

FATHER
What are you up to huh
- JACK
Nothing
FATHER

Nothing Can I play too

(Jack nods)
Let me finish this and Ill be
right with you 0K

Jack nods as his father releases him He watches his dad turn
back to the desk and pick up THE BEAUTIFUL GOLD PEN and begins
to write in a SMALL BLACK BOOK

Jacks eye then wanders to the other wonders of this warm and
inviting room filled with books and mementos The walls are soft
earthy colors - okre pumpkin and soft browns A big leather
couch sits against the wall opposite the door Bookshelves line
the walls with a desk and chair sitting snugly beneath then

He looks way up to the top of the bookshelves where giant

books with big words he doesnt understand lay on their sides
Titles like THE TEACHINGS OF THE SECRET SCHOOLS ARCANE LAWS FOR
THE AGES EINSTEINS THEORY OF RELATIVITY THE PHYSICS OF MAGIC
Jack moves to a PHOTOGRAPH tacked on the wall

ANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH -

The most beautiful beach you can imagine Not only does every-
thing look pristine and unspoiled by civilization - the colors
in the photo are almost surreal The sky is bright bright
bluethe water is a shimmering rich indigothe sand almost
sparkling beneath an orange red perfectly round sun

The photo looks HOLOGRAPHIC He is captivated by it

ANGLE ON FATHER -

His father continues to write when suddenly he notices that
THE WATER IN A GLASS on his desk is starting to QUIVER He feels
the desk itself starting to VIBRATE ever so slightly

He turns on Jack abruptly
FATHER

JACK
tf -
Startled Jack turns - dropping his taxi cab and remote
FATHER
Go to your room II have to finish this 0K
JACK
(feeling the shaking)
It is an earthquake
FATHER
- No just a tremor I thinkGo on
Jack moves to the door His father eyes him - with a loving yet
troubled gaze then speaks to his own surprise
FATHER
Jack
(Jack turns at the door)
Dont be afraid
The father utters this line with a deeper meaning than Jack
understands So he nods and exits closing the door behind hin
CUT TO
Cc EXT STUDY - DAY SAME TIME

Jack exits and closes the door He begins to walk back to his
room when he realizes he forgot his toy cab in the study He
turns around and walks back to the door But as he reaches for
the knob he stops He stops because he hears

THE WHISPERING OF TWO VOICES FROM INSIDE THE STUDY

A chill runs down his back He is curious but also
apprehensive THE WHISPERS ARE ANGRY in tone We pick
up only hints

WHISPER ONE
Im sick of you telling me what to do

WHISPER TWO (FATHER)
PleaseNot here

WHISPER ONE
Where is it I have a right to know too
Jack decides to go in He reaches for the knob but stops when

CcU ON KNOB as it begins to shake as if from another tremor
Then it stops Jacks hand turns the knob and pushes open the
door It swings wide to reveal that

THE ROOM Is EMPTY AGAIN No dad No whispering voices

Jack enters in wonder and confusion His nervousness causes his
breathing to turn shallow He pulls out an INHALER (BRONCODIALTOR
used for asthma) and takes two breaths Looking around the room
he notices on the floor A CANDY WRAPPER for a MINT CALLED

FRESH BREATH He is sure it wasnt there before He picks it up

LILY (0S)
JACK COME IN HERE AND HAVE LUNCH
Jack jumps He rushes out of the room and closes the door behind
him CAMERA REMAINS on the TOY TAXI CAB which Jack
has yet again left behind

INT KITCHEN LATER THAT DAY

Jack is playing with his tuna fish sandwich eating on a stool at
the kitchen counter In the BG through glass doors we can see
the LEGS AND TORSO OF LILY who lies in the yard sunbathing A
radio plays the song evocative of the period THE PHONE RINGS
Jack slides off his stool and picks up

JACK
Hello

AN UPSET UNCLE TOMMY speaks from the other end hiding the pain
in his voice

Camera is on Jack as he panics watching his mother get upset

JACK

She starts crying as she drops the phone and runs 0S Jack gets
off the stool and listens but Tommy is gone He hangs it up

He walks off towards his mother but decides not to follow
Instead he enters his fathers study and looks around

Cur TO

INT MANHATTAN APARTMENT - TWILIGHT ee

Jack walks through a long foyer On the walls are MOVIE POSTERS
OF B-HORROR MOVIES from the 70s starring LILY CAVANAUGH

He enters the living room to find her downing the last of the
scotch as she slips on her coat He senses she is in a bad mood
LILY
Help me with this will ya
(Jack eases her coat onto her)
Did we pack the photo albums of
your dads family

JACK
Those are in storage in LA
when we packed up the Encino house
(adolescent annoyance)
Our entire lives are in storage

LILY
- Yeah well when you turn eighteen
you can put me in storage
Along with the rest of the junk

Lilys sarcastic self-deprecating talk hurts Jack He looks to
the posters that had given Lily the image of being a beautiful
sexy siren being either tormented hunted or coveted by some
evil Only one seems to stand out as different from the others a
love story called QUEEN FOR A DAY Now Lily seems not only
older but beaten Her skin is pallid her body skin and bones
She picks up her bag from a hall table along with A BOTTLE OF
PRESCRIPTION PILLS which she tosses in her bag Jack follows

THE PHONE RINGS which stops them both Jack moves to answer

but Lily stops hin

LILY
Let the machine pick up

There is a trace of anxiety in her voice which Jack notices
The machine turns on An OLDER MANS VOICE (MORGAN SLOAT)
leaves a message

MORGAN (0S)
Lily its Morgan Where the hell are you
You cant run forever kid

We recognize it as the SAME VOICE we heard as the SECOND ANGRY
WHISPER when Jack was little and listening at the study door

«-eIm not going away that easy
And if you think I am you got
some bigger problems than you real-
By this point Lily has crossed to the machine and turned it off

JACK
Now hes going to know you were here
LILY
I dont care Lets go

They exit

tell Jack is disturbed by this

JACK

Lily hides her uneasiness at this statement

LILY
I called Susie and told her where wed be

JACK
What am I going do about school

LILY
RelaxChrist Youre taking a little
sabbatical No big dealI called
your teacher She gave you
that book report to do

She indicates the ON THE ROAD on his lap Jack grimaces

JACK
I hate it I dont understand it
All they do is drive all over
the place and get drunk at parties

CU LILY as she says half sarcastically half seriously

LILy
Not such a bad idea a
Jack hates this side of his mother He turns away and leans
against the window and tries to sleep In the window
HE SEES HIS MOTHERS REFLECTION floating eeriely along the
darkening highway He is clearly upset and worried about her
EXT ARCADIA BEACH - DAWN

The ride has taken all night The car drives through a deserted
beach town Grey and lifeless its a ghosttown after the summer
Beyond the town they drive past the ARCADIA FUNWORLD

A broken neon sign flashes ARCDIA UNWORLD

CUT TO
EXT ALHAMBRA INNS AND GARDENS - MORNING
A place that looks like its “at the end of the world

CUT TO
INT DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

A giant dining hall with over a hundred tables Jack and Lily
however are the only people here Theirs is the only table set
All the other tables are covered or have chairs stacked on then

LILY
I wonder why no one else comes to dinner

JACK
(sarcastic)
Maybe because they dont
serve intravenous entrees on the menu

Lily gives him a dirty look as A CURT WAITER approaches then
He speaks his dialogue with deadpan irony

WAITER
Can I get you anything from the bar

LILY
Id like a martini Straight up Very dry

JACK

The waiter doesnt get it Lily tells the waiter

LILY

She starts coughing from her cigarette Jack is disturbed by
this He hands her a glass of water She puts out her cigarette

JACK

LILY
(nods)
Just a tickle

Jacks face tells us he knows its more Lily looks at her watch
She pulls out her medication and takes one with the water

Jack eyes the prescription Lily sees this Before he can ask
another question Lily knows she must tell him something

so she tells him a story as she lights up another cigarette

LILY

Long time agoIt was the dead of winter
The year I got the nomination for
QUEEN FOR A DAY He was so excited

studio put us up in some four star
place do the whole nine yards
I knew I wouldt win butthere was no
telling your father He did have a point -
I mean it was the first time I
wasnt being chased with a buzz saw The
Academy loves it when you do something
different They think its talent
(Jack loves listening to her)

But it wasnt really I was just
playing a girl in loveAnd
it so happened at the time I was
SO I convinced him to take me away
and we would watch the awards on TV
He found this place It was so
empty we kept moving to bigger rooms
in the middle of the night When I lost
I remember he said to me Lil we couldnt
be any luckier than we are right now I
couldnt love you any more than I do right now

(stops almost crying then smiles)
And thenwellnine months later

LILY
Pain in the ass

Beat Lily puffs on her cigarettethen asks softly

LILY

steed weathervane projected on the ground through the moonlight
As the wind spins the steed its image alternately appears

chair with a newspaper on his lap Jack hesitatesthen asks

JACK
Excuse meExcuse me
The 01a Man is startled and stares at Jack in a confused state
JACK
Sorry but I heard you

The Old Man stares at him in complete bewilderment Jack sighs

JACK
Forget it Its 0KSorry

Jack walks away Camera follows him as he heads out of the lounge
until a VOICE 0S stops him

OLD MAN (0S)
Cancer

Jack stops He turns The Old Man is looking at him from around
the big chair

OLD MAN

Jack turns white Everyone seems to be looking at him He is
practically in shock He runs out of the hotel

cur TO
EXT ALHAMBRA INNS BEACH - DAY
A grey day The beach is deserted Jack RUNS as if he were
being chased Soon he slows down out of breath feeling lost

Along the shore are empty cans papers and various bits
of trash The water looks brown and dirty-

JACK
Forget it Its not true Its not true

He pulls out his INHALER and begins taking serveral hits

He sits on the shore and pulls out his copy of “ON THE ROAD
He starts to read The book blocks our view of his face But
the book lowers as Jack loses interest and stares out into the
oceanHe breaks down and starts to cry After a beat or two
he raises his head for a moment down the beach to see

The eerie figure of a MAN standing very still far down the
beach It stands like a shadow backlit by the hazy sun
The same shadowman from the night before

Jack looks curiously then with a slow recognition

JACK
(mutters confused)
Uncle Tommy

He rises and begins to walk saying a little louder

JACK
Uncle Tomny

He begins to run dropping ON THE ROAD which is swallowed up
by the waves

Camera tracks alongside him as he runs down the beach

and right into the arms of UNCLE TOMMY who picks him up and
hugs him tight as if for dear life He is worn out and
unshaven He looks as if hes been in the same clothes for days
He also looks scared

UNCLE TOMMY
(Lovingly)
Oh Jackie

JACK
Where have you been Nobody knows-

UNCLE TOMMY
I know I know kiddo

JACK
We should go tell Mom

UNCLE TOMMY
OK0knot right now though

Are you cold

JACK
(nods)
I ran out without my jacket

UNCLE TOMMY
Lets go inside somewhere

They head for the Arcadia Funworld beach entrance Tommy looks
around furtively to make sure no one can see then

cuT TO
INT ARCADIA FUNWORLD The Funhouse DAY

A skeletal abandoned barn-like structure with windows that
run along the beach side and the Main Street side Empty spaces
which once held video games and pinball machines surround

Tommy and Jack In the center is an old fashioned CAROUSEL
Tommy heads straight for the Main Street side and looxs

out the windows He seems anxious worried

UNCLE TOMMY
When did you get here

JACK
Last night What-

UNCLE TOMMY
Does Morgan know youre here

JACK
No He called before we left but
Mom didnt talk to him

TOMMY
How is your Mom

Suddenly Jacks face grows dark and serious Tommy turns when
Jack doesnt respond sees his face and knows what this means

- TOMMY
I guess she told you huh

JACK
(child-like baiting)
Told me what

Tommy kneels down before and speaks very straightforwardly
refusing to coddle Jack

TOMMY
Jack I know this is hardbut

TOMMY
if you want to ask me a question
then you ask me Dont play games
Youre not a little kid anymore

Jack feely slightly reprimanded straightens up and decides to
meet the challenge

JACK
Does my Mom have cancer

TOMMY
(pause then plainly)
- Yes

This stings Jack But he raises his courage to ask

JACK
Is she dying

Pause Tommy knows he has to do this but he doesn’t want to

TOMMY
Yes

Jack face goes white His worst nightmare is coming true
Tommy grabs him by the shoulders

UNCLE TOMMY
Im sorry kid
But you gotta be strong now
Ive got alot to tell you And we dont
have ‘much time Youve got to leave
this place Right away

JACK
(upset holding back tears)
Good hate it here

UNCLE TOMMY
No you have to go because its dangerous
hereAnd because youre needed
somewhere elseAnd because
You can save your Mon

JACK L-
(dumbfounded)
What

At that moment Tommys sees out of the Main Street window
A BLACK VAN turning slowly cruising down the deserted street
Clearly scared Tommy quickly pulls Jack out of view

S 23

-
He puts his hand over Jacks mouth pressing both of them
or against the wall until the BLACK VAN stops in front of the
Funworld Jack reads on the side of the van the words WILD
CHILD are spray painted in big block letters

UNCLE TOMMY
God Phil forgive me I lead them right to hin

Tommy pulls Jack roughly to the center of the carousel They
squat down low so as not to be seen He peers in between the
horses and sees

The Van slowly driving away
Tommy breathes a momentary sigh of relief Jack is scared now

JACK
Whos in the van Why are they fol-

TOMMY
Listen Youve got to listen
There isnt enough time Theres
too much to tellI111 try to
get to everything butyou just

Jack nods apprehensively A simple man Tommy tries to explain
TOMMY
(frustrated TALKS FAST)

Arent many like him He always

-And he was right There is more

And it felt like a real place

Jack shakes his head He doesnt understand

doors of the Funworld begin to shake The WILD CHILD VA
PARKED IN FRONT Someone with great strength is trying

TOMMY
Hurry Put some on your finger
and then rub it on this spot
right between your eyes above your nose
(Jack tries to object but)
DO ITTheres no time

He hands the vial to Jack just as
THE BARN DOORS begin to break apart

Tommy quickly moves to the CAROUSEL CONTROL PANEL and
THE CAROUSELCausing the horses to move quickly aro
for additional protection Meanwhile Jack dabs his fi
hesitating to rub it on

TOMMY
Go ahead

Jack rubs the liquid into his forehead as the carouse

POV JACK

The carousel horses spin around the Funworld Arcade

the barn doors as they break open more and moreth
as if one half of the arcade were wiped away the bar
gone and replaced by AN OPEN FIELD with LIVE HORSES

carousel continues its revolution THE REST OF THE ARCADE
DISAPPEARS AS WELL until all Jack can see is AN OPEN FIELD
AND HORSES

WIDE ANGLE TERRITORIES

Jack sits in the middle of a circle of HORSES GALLOPING in
a perfect circle like trained circus animalsHe cant believe
his eyes He scans the scene beyond the horses

It is the beach from his fathers holographic photo Jack
is amazed His Uncle is suddenly behind

- JACK
My God

AND YET IT IS THE SAME BEACH WHERE THE ALHAMBRA INNS AND
HIS MOTHER STILL AREBut its not the same

The colors are extraordinaryly vivid He turns to where the
Alhambra Inns normally stands and finds there is nothing there
but miles of tall sea grass blowing gently in the wind He takes
deep breaths and feels lighter clearer He looks at the horizen
line where the indigo ocean meets a sky the color of faded
deminthe horizon-line shows a faint but unmistakable curve
The water is not brown but a clear clean blue The Funhouse is
gone but instead there stands the tall TENTED PAVILLION Lae
l
yw

Even their clothes have changed - a one piece worksuit made 7o
of some kind of canvas material with cloth shoes in a drab
tan color Most of the people are wearing this uniform

JACK
Holy shitWhat happened Where are we

TOMMY
We flipped over They call this
place the Territories

JACK
But what

TOMMY
(speaking softly but urgently)
Sshhh Just follow me

Tommy and Jack cut through the horses beyond the circle and
down to the beachThey start walking passing by various
kinds of carnival performers practising their crafts

Jack looking at the sights in awe is gently down to the beach
They take a step or two then Jack staggers breathing heavily

JACK
I feel a little dizzy

TOMMY
OKsit downIll get you some water

Jack sits in the sand - his head reeling Tommy exits 0S

Jack searches for his inhaler and pulls out a BAMBOO REED

He doesnt know what to do with it He panics for a moment
afraid he wont be able to catch his breathBut suddenly

he realizes that HE CAN BREATH QUITE EASILY HERE He takes a
deep breath He takes another to make sure he isnt being fooled
He looks for Uncle Tommy

Out on the shore he sees TOMMY CUPPING SOME WATER IN HIS HANDS
as it washes back into the ocean He brings it back to Jack
Jack flinches but Tommy explains

TOMMY
Its 0Kits fresh water

JACK
A fresh water ocean

TOMMY
Wellits salt water when it
comes inbut after it gives the
salt to the beach it goes back fresh
Thats why you have to catch it on
its way backHere

Jack hesitantly sips the water and to his amazement it is fresh

TOMMY
All shore villages are about the salt
See those huts

Jack looks up the beach to several huts with big BOILING POTS
and TUBES over fire that look like pre-Industrial Revolution
machinery SKilled workers labor about the machinery

TOMMY
The water gives the salt to
the sand and the people take
the salt out of the sandThen
they trade it

JACK

Buthowhow does the water give
the salt

TOMMY
See those guys in the long robes

Jack looks in the other direction and sees

A line of SEVERAL OLD MEN in long robes sitting on the beach
facing the ocean and talking under their breaths in unison

TOMMY
Theyre kind of like priests They talk to
the ocean all day asking it for salt
andwellthe ocean gives it

Jack looks at-Tommy like hes nuts Tommy shrugs

TOMMY

Have you ever seen a sky so blue
There are no cars here Jack no factories
Youre either a farmer or a salt worker
or an ironsmith

(respectfully)
Skill Jack Everyone has a skill
theyre proud of First time your father
took me I thought I was in heaven
He told me its been here for centuries

(he sits frustrated)
I wish he were here now He could explain
Im not a philosopher or scientist The
easiest way I guess is to say that -
the world we knowit just isnt the only one
Except our minds think it is
These other worlds are going on right at
the same time only we cant see them
unless we work at it with
our imaginations which comes from some
Place elsesome place I dont know
more of Gods world Your dad said imagination
wasnt just something kids played with
that imagination was more even powerful
than any science or any machine because
everything that was ever created - started
out an idea in somebodys imagination
And because everything has imagination -
even the water That thing back home
about the Earth being alive and all
Well they get that idea from the Territories
Looks like magic to us But these people
believe in the magiclikelike
we believe in physics back home

Jack listens with astonishment

TOMMY
Your Dad said this wasnt even the only
« other worldThere are more
And all these different
worlds are all connected somehow
So that sometimes what you do
in one worldcan affect the other
Your Dad was trying help them make
things right here soso that
things would be right in our world
(gravely)
Already there are parts of the
Territories that are ruinedbad
- water air you cant breathsick
animals and people - all from our world
Ever since your Dad and Uncle Morgan
first came here

JACK
Dad

TOMMY
It wasnt his fault But it happened
anywayGreed and ambition can flip
over just as easy as you and I did

VOICE (0S)
What are you two doing here

Tommy and Jack are taken by surprise Jack especially is shocked
to see that the Voice is coming from an OFFICIAL looking person
in A WHITE UNIFORM WITH A CREST ONE SERPENT enwtined around a
POLE PIERCING THROUGH A CIRCLEBut what is more shocking

is that Jack knows this man HE I8 THE NAZI HOTEL

Jack is completely confused The Official stares at him
Clearly he does not recognize him Jack stares back

JACK

Tommy smacks him so hard he knocks him to the ground
TOMMY «

Excuse me most sincerely I beg your pardon
Tommy drags Jack off beating him The Official watches them
with a keen eye as they walk off

TOMMY
If I hear one more word out of

with you with no food and water

Tommy walks Jack to the Main Road to a safe distance away

TOMMY
Are you all right

JACK
Yeah for getting a severe beating

TOMMY
Thats one of Morgans men
Believe me if he knew who you were he

JACK

JACK

JACK

TOMMY
Not everybody has them just some
because there are alot less people

TOMMY

A PROCESSION of people in the same drab one piece uniforms
files across the pavillion with a band musical accompaninment

TOMMY
Theyre all here to pay their
respects to the MaiaCome on
Tommy and Jack join the line that leads inside the pavillion
CUT TO
INT PAVILLION - DAY
A multi-colored tented structure

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN lying on a Riise) surrounded by guards

as village people walk by one by sprie to pay their respects

Her face is blocked by the people but we can tell that she is
lying with a blanket over her The people walk by and bow their
heads reverently Jack stands behind Tommy - his eye view
blocked by the heights of the adults in front of him He is
three people from the woman when suddenly

The Maia has a coughing fit and we realize that she is sick
When she starts coughing Jack stops The coughing strikes him
as familiar He watches as the next person moves on revealing
the Maias face Jack is overwhelmed by what he sees

THE MAIA IS HIS MOTHER

Jack almost faints but Tommy catches him and moves him along
But as they walk away CAMERA STAYS ON THE MAIA who catches

a glimpse of Jack as he exits Her face registers both

elation and fearShe starts murmuring

MAIA
JasonJasonJason

Her upset attracts the attention of the Guards who look about
them suspiciously But a lady in waiting calms down the Maia

with a tonic and the guards brush it off as a delirious fit
- cuT TO

EXT PAVILLION - DAY

Tommy moves Jack along briskly But Jack is deeply affected

JACK
What did you call her

TOMMY
The MaiaIt means Queen of
- MagicBut her name is Laura
She is worshipped above everyone
elseAnd shes dying
She has no idea whats been going
on in her own land because Morgan
is the only one allowed to speak with
her Hes been running things
behind her back lying to her

Jack is begining to understand

JACK
Uncle Morgans been after my mom to
sign some papers that give him the
real estate company he and my dad-

TOMMY

NONow listen to meno matter
what dont let your mother sign Sho
anything Remember what I said
about doing something in one world
affecting the other

(Jack nods)
over here Laura gave the land
to the peoplesee Laura IS the land
Theyre connected by some kind of
magic they believeand the people
believe that theyre here to care
for the land because thats how
they honor herIts like their religion
But no one person or family
owns anythingits collective
andsince its collective
no one person has the authority to
take resources out - resources like
silver copper gold - even
uraniumSee most of the Territory
people are farmersThey dont know
to do with gold or uranium They think it has

cg
pak
(

TOMMY
something to do with the lands magic
« and to take it is somehow dangerous
But in our worldThere is a use for it
AndMorgan been stealing land and forcing
the people here to mine for him ever since
(walking)
He leaves the shore villages alone
because the people understand the value of
the salt But the further inland you get
things are differentMorgans men
run everything - Thats why
Morgan arranges for Laura to visit only
- shore villages where everything
looks like its still intact
The further West - its a nightmare
Priests like those are either killed
or put in prison And anbody who
follows their faith and refuses to
hurt the landgets worse

Tommy looks around and sees TWO GUARDS exiting the pavillion
whispering to each other and searching for someone

TOMMY
We better flip back now

Tommy and Jack hide beneath a railing

OUR WORLD
EXT PARKING LOT ALHAMBRA INNS - DAY

Tommy and Jack are croutched between two parked cars in the lot
adjacent to the hotel - far from the beach

JACK
How did we get so far from the beach

TOMMY
The Territories are smaller You walk
a mile here you can cover five times
that over there So you may want
to do most of your travelling in the-

JACK
(frustrated)
Wait a minute What am I doing exactly
And what does this have to do with Mom

Tommy stops and gives him the last piece of information

co - TOMMY
Because Laura is your mothers
Twinner - if you can save her
you can save your MomAnd the one
thing that can save Laura - is the Talisman

JACK
Talisman What is it - medicine

TOMMY

No No one really knows what it is
Some think its just a fairy tale
But others in the Territories
believe in it like people here believe
in a Messiah comingThey believe

(prayerfully)
that a child Prince will come forth
a child born of flesh and of magic
that he will go from one ocean

to the otherfrom one Alhambra to another
And that he will find this Talisman
and with it create a new destiny for all S

(Jack is thoroughly confused)
Here your father wanted me to give you this
He said in the Territories it
- would make everything clear to you

TOMMY PULLS OUT A BLACK BOOK - the one Jacks Father was writing
in the dad he died Jack takes the book reverently and
immediately reminded of something - It is the same BLACK BOOK his
FATHER WAS WRITING IN the day he diedJack opens the cover ALL
THE PAGES ARE BLANK BUT ON THE INSIDE COVER A NOTE HAS BEEN
WRITTEN TO HIM BY HIS FATHER

a

PHIL (V0)
When I was a child I spake as a
child I understood as a child
I thought as a child but when I
became a man I put away childish
thingsDont be afraid I love you Dad

Jack begins to cry

JACK o
I dont understand any of this
I dont know what the hell youre
talking about This is nuts Im
supposed to cross an entire country
and find some lucky charm no one
has ever seen Im no child prince

TOMMY
I didnt tell you the entire truth
before You did have a Twinner

JACK
Well where is he

TOMMY
He was the son of the Maia and the King
He was killed As an infant He
was suffocated

Jacks head reels He reaches for his asthma inhaler
TOMMY

They killed him because they thought
they could prevent the prohecy from
happening They thought if they
killed the King and your father
that you would never know who you
are and what youre supposed to do
But they didnt know youre father
took me there That he prepared me
Your dad knew what you were going to
be up against I think he even knew he was
going to die And when I heard about your
mom I knew the time was here

JACK
Butwhat about MomShell never
let me go

JACK

Then dont tell her Because
you have to go Jack If you dont
she has no chance

(Jack freezes up)
I know it doesnt make any sense
right now but it will I promise
Justbelieve it for now
You can save her JackYou can
save them both

and puts it in her pocket Jack decides to write her a noteHe
pulls out some hotel stationary and a pen His mother coughs
in her sleep Jack rises and moves to her bedside He thinks
of the Maia in the Territories He wishes her illness would
just go away and he wouldnt have to go himself He pulls a
blanket from her feet up to her neck He looks at her with
such love he almost cries The PHONE RINGS JACK PICKS UP

CUT TO

SO

EXT TERRITORIES ROAD - DAY

He takes in the beauty of the Territories passing rolling hills
of farmland Meadows with animals grazing The houses he passes
are simple wood huts with thatched roofs or stone houses with
wooden roofs The Territories is not a Fairyland or a place of
science fiction It is a purer land - agriculturally based no
electricity where people go to bed when the sun does

-—- er - -

Looking ahead Jack sees a TALL TOWER standing isolated in a
field Around the tower he sees SEVERAL BIRDS FLYING The
sight makes him smile for some reason and he continues walking
towards it

POV

DOLLY FOWARD as the tower and the birds get closer we begin
we begin to make out something odd about these birds

BACK TO JACK
He too notices something odd His interest quickens his pace

as he keeps his eye on the tower and the birds Suddenly he
stops and he sees what his eyes cannot believe

yo

-——Ss ee we -

POV

A MAN step out onto a tiny ledge high up on the tower
Quite unexpectedly the MAN JUMPS and PLUMMETS TO THE EARTH

Jack gasps in horror until just as unexpectedly
THE MAN ARCHES HIS BODY AND BEGINS TO FLY

Jack stands in awe He realizes then that what he thought were
birds were not at all - THE TOWER IS SURROUNDED BY FLYING MEN
soaring gracefully around its peak diving and turning in
perfect unison He cant believe his eyes He is overcome

by the beauty-of the scene He sinks down to the grass and
watches in reverence

He pulls out the BLACK NOTEBOOK of his fathers and notices
another change The BLACK BOOK in the Territories has a title
It is called THE BOOK OF GOOD PARMING He opens the book

He turns a page entitled PROVERBS the first page reading

JACK
MAKE FRIENDS WITH WHATEVER IS HAPPENING
AT THIS MOMENT

As he reads this A GIANT SHADOW LOOMS OVER HIM AND THE PAGE
blocking out the sun Jack looks up and is so startled by what
he sees he drops the book and pushes himself away

WOLF (0S)
You stranger here right WOLF
WOLF can tellI can tell
right here and now HAHAH

Jack tries to make out this towering figure who starts laughing

WOLF standing over six feet tall with huge bulging muscles
busting through a pair of bib overalls that looked too small
His huge bare feet are covered with pufts of hair as are

his giant hands Long black hair hung shaggy down his back to
his shoulderblades He has a big friendly face and wide
expressive eyes and a bellowing voice

WOLF
You a stranger here right

(Jack nods Wolf laughs)
HaHAWolf right I can smell it
Smell not so bad but different

I can smell it on youWOLF
(extending his hand)
Shakin hands right here and now

Jack gingerly extends his hands and Wolf begins to shake it
so hard Jacks entire body bounces
WOLF

JACK

JackNice to meet ya

WOLF
Nice to meet you too God pound it
(suddenly distracted 0S)
- HEYHEYGET BACK THERE

Jack is jolted again by Wolf voice and strength He watches Wolf
sprint over to a herd of sheep or rather COW-SHEEP the
Territories half breed equivalent He watches as Wolf uses his
great strength to grab an errant cow-sheep and pick

him up to carry him on his backHe smiles at Jack as he works

WOLF
Got to watch them all the time
(proudly)
Thats my jobProtect the herd WOLF

Jack takes this as an exit opportunity

JACK
Well then I11 just be getting going
I dont want to interrupt your uh

WOLF
OH NO NO

Wolf runs back to Jack as such a powerful speed Jack almost
starts run away but then thinks better of it

WOLF
Are you heading for market -

JACK
(strikes his interest)
Theres a market near here

WOLF
Sure You come with Wolf I take you
Wolf hungry Need some meatI can smell

Fearing himself as lunch Jack tries to resist

JACK
Well maybe not Ill just

But Wolf has already grabbed Jacks hand playfully and is
pulling him toward the herd Jack follows like a limp rag doll

JACK

EXT MARKETPLACE - DAY

Walking past the pavillion Jack moves amidst a huge crowd in

AN OPEN MARKET teaming with activity Roasted meats hang from
every stall traders sell beautifully woven baskets and blankets
leather dealers sell sacks and shoes in every sizeChildren
run in and out of the stalls playing as their parents do attend
to business

Meanwhile WOLF is in the fields behind the stalls talking with
a merchant about his herd

Inside the mainflow of the market Jack decides to lose himself
to get away from Wolf He crosses to the man selling blankets

JACK
Id like a blanket please
Something in cotton though
wool irritates my skin

The BLANKET MAN stares at him suspiciously Then

MAN
You got money
(Jack nods)
Let me see

Jack reaches into his pocket and much to his surprise pulls
out A BUNCH OF JOINTED STICKS instead of dollar bills

JACK
I2 dont what happenedI had a whole

But the man isnt listening Hes pulling down a blanket and
handing it to Jack Jack is thoroughly confused

MAN

(expecting payment)
Well

-- we

Jack is frozen not knowing what to do The man impatiently
reaches over and breaks one stack of sticks in half pocketing
the pieces

MAN
Thank you
JACK
(stunned this worked)
Thank you

He walks off with his blanket staring at his bunch of sticks

He stops by a-STALL SELLING MAPS and stares intently on a
MAP OF THE TERRITORIES - which looks like a shrunken scale of
the US He studies it carefully and is about to buy one when

SEVERAL PALE MILKY WHITE FACED MEN ON WHITE HORSES IN WHITE
SUITS WITH WHITE SNAKE CANES attached to their belts

thunder into the marketplace On their uniforms are the

SNAKE CREST There is clearly a LEADER flanked by FOUR YOUTHS
Young boys who resemble NAZI HITLER YOUTHS

Jack is frightened He ducks so as not to be seen but watches
the action through the stall

One of the NAZI YOUTHS almost runs over a MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
with his horse The woman falls to ground and a BOOK falls out
of her bag The Uniformed Youth sees this and calls

UNINFORMED YOUTH
OSMOND

Osmond is the leader who responds by signalling the others to
halt as they form a circle around the WOMAN There is an
immediate danger in the air

Osmond dismounts his horse and picks up the book - THE BOOK OF
GOOD FARMING His manner is mean sadistic Fascistic

OSMOND
What is this woman

The woman is speechless pale with fear
OSMOND
Dont you know this book of Magic
is forbidden Expressly forbidden
by Morgan of Orris himself
on Morgans name Jack expresses confusion and interest
The Book of Good Farming peeks out of his back pocket He pushes —

it deep inside his pants

WOMAN
Please Dear Osmond
On my life On the lives
of my children I meant no harmI
I was merely carrying it for a friend
whom I scolded severely for even-

OSMOND
ENOUGH

(She stopsHe speaks to the crowd)
How many more of you are keeping
this book ANSWER ME

(No one answers)

Ill have you know Morgan is on his
way this very moment It would please
him I know to retrieve as many of
these crimminal texts as possible

He eyes his men The people of the market eye each other -
knowing all too well what is coming

OSMOND
Would anyone care to come forward
and offer the name or names of
anyone whom to their knowledge
posseses this book Mmnm

The people look frightened and on the brink of turning each other
inThen OSMOND mounts his horse and raises his cane

The cane transforms into a JAGGED SWORD of brillant steel and
before anyone can blink HE PLUNGES THE SWORD INTO THE WOMAN
People scream out Jack is sick with fear and disgust

OSMOND
SEARCH THE MARKETPLACE

At once all the other uniformed men begin to tear apart the
marketplace in search of other copies of the book People are
trampled and beaten as the men relish the opportunity to destroy

Jack sees a FOREST which begins at the end of the markplace
He runs behind the stalls toward it

As Osmond oversees the destruction HE NOTICES THE FIGURE OF JACK
moving behind each stall He rides his horse 0S

EXT END OF MARKETPLACEBEGINING OF FOREST DAY

Jack has almost safely reached the forest when OSMOND APPEARS
in front of him rearing his horse JACK FALLS TO THE GROUND
When HE LOOKSUP TO OSMOND OSMOND SEEMS TO RECOGNIZE HIM

OSMOND
Who are you What is your name

Jack tries to speak but is too frightened Suddenly Osmond
also looks frightened as he says

OSMOND
Jason

The fear turns to FURY as he reaches for his SWORD Jack
acting on pure instinct GRABS A HANDFUL OF DIRT AND THROWS
IT IN THE HORSES EYES THE HORSE REARS UP SHAKING HIS HEAD
AND TOSSING ITS BODY -

JACK TAKES THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RUN INTO THE FOREST

He stops by a group of trees to catch his breath

Ahead of him he sees a STONE BRIDGE connected to the road
Safely shielded by the trees he begins to run for the bridge

A RUMBLING LIKE THUNDER begins slowly eerily - as if from

a great distance but increasing in volume with each second
Suddenly THE LIGHT OF THE DAY BEGINS TO DIM A darkness begins
to fall over the forest as the rumbling gets louder and louder
Jack is petrified The rumbling is almost upon him - It is
deafening in its intensity Jack covers his ears and kneels
beside a tree searching through his pocket for the VIAL

He looks up to discover the source of this nightmarish roar

IN SLO-MO - through Jacks POV - Camera angles on a BEAUTIFUL
BLACK DILIGENCE moving through the forest on the main road
heading for the bridge As it comes closer we and Jack can

see that the man driving the diligence is none other than
MORGAN OF ORRIS Although the face is the same as Uncle Morgan
the similarity ends there This Morgan is sleek and muscular
with long black hair that flies in the wind a sculpted

face and jaw and eyes like black pearls He wears a

revealing black one piece with a black cape Upon his diligence

is a giant insignia of THE SNAKE ON THE POLE THROUGH THE CIRCLE
As he drives by Morgan smells something in the air It is
Jack We see this awareness cross his face like a veil

HE- SLOWS DOWN THE HORSES on top of the bridge He looks out
into the woods Suddenly he bellows

MORGAN
JASON

So startled is Jack that he drops the vial and liquid begins to
pour out He quickkly retrieves it and applies some to his
finger

MORGAN
JASSSSOOOOOONNNNNNN

Jack quickly raises his finger-tip of liquid to his
temple closes his eyesAND FLIPS BACK TO OUR WORLD

EXT OUR WORLD THE OATLEY TUNNEL - TWILIGHT

Jack opens his eyes He is in the middle of a read facing
a DARK TUNNEL

SUDDENLY TWO LIGHTS COME BEAMING DOWN ON HIM
A BLACK LIMOSINE STRETCH shoots out of the tunnel bearing down
on him Jack jumps into the shoulder of the highway rolling
into the trees

CuT TO
INT LIMOSINE - NIGHT
Camera pans to backseat carrying UNCLE MORGAN SLOAT He
turns his head to look out the window as if some feeling
suddenly struck him But seeing nothing he turns his attention
back inside He sits fiddling with something in his hand

IT IS A LITTLE TIN KEY on the end of a key chain that he keeps
turning over in his hand

A suspicious FEMALE INNKEEPER asks

JACK

She hands him a take-out menu from an all night pizzeria
Jack feels like an idiot

Jack is distracted by A FAMILY leaving the motel They consist

of a mother a father a ten year old girl and a BOY around

and going over a map of the Unites States He compares it with
a self-drawn map of the Territories By tracing one over the

impressed with the distance

He opens his fathers BLACK NOTEBOOK and leafs through the pages
AS HE FLIPS FROM THE BACK END WE SEE THAT ALL THE PAGES ARE
BLANKHe finally reaches a page that is half-filled and reads

Knowing the Prince was near
The Prince hidden by the Maia

the innkeeper as a GARBAGE DUMP Jack careens

down the slippery leaves and branches until he falls into

a heap of garbage that the innkeeper threw out It stinks
Disgusted Jack flings the garbage off of hin

He looks up from his ditch to the ridge and sees the illumination
of several flashlight beams He crawls carefully back up the

hill to take a look at what is going on

EXT ROADSIDE IN FRONT OF OATLEY INN - NIGHT
Jack peers over the hill concealed by trees and debris to see

The Police are searching with lights exchanging information as
the Innkeeper stands by the front door in her housecoat
Everything appears pretty normal until a BLACK VAN drives up to
the Inn and is approached by police The van has WILD CHILD
written on the side The Police go up to the window of the van
The window rolls down and they talk to the driver

Jack keeps taking hits on the inhaler as he watches

The Innkeeper brings out some of Jacks belongings that were

authority to inspect

At this point Jack DROPS HIS INHALER down the hill It falls

EXT FOREST NEAR A STREAM - MORNING

Exhausted Jack had fallen asleep in the forest spending the
night beneath-a giant tree - using the maps as a blanket and
the Book of Good Farming as a pillow He is asleep on the

bank of a clear clean stream that runs parallel to the forest

A COW-SHEEP begins licking Jacks faceJack smiles himself
awake but loses his smile once he is face to face with it

WOLF (0S)
GODS NAILS GET AWAY FROM HIM
GOT NO SENSE GET AWAY FROM HIM
FORE I BITE YOUR GOD POUNDING EARS OFF

Jack is jolted upright by the sound of that familar roar

It is WOLFcrossing the stream to Jack with a big smile on
his big face On the other bank his herd of cow-sheep are
drinking daintily Behind them is a wide open field

Wolf towers above Jack blocking out the sun

WOLF
Stranger aintcha - we met before
God Pound itWOLFGood old

He grabs Jacks hand and shakes it like he was pumping a slot
machine Jacks entire body shakes along with it

WOLF

He picks Jack up like a bag of groceries Jack protests
JACK

then resurfaces panting for air

WOLF

Jack tries to catch his breath and finds that he can
JACK
(sarcastic)
Yes thank you
Wolf picks up the cow-sheep and walks him across the strean
WOLF
I got to bring this one back
They not strong enough to swim

bad smell and I come back OK

He swims the animal back on his shoulder passes Jack who is
not too excited about being joined for a bath

JACK

He looks around him Its absolutely beautiful - the yellow of
the open field the blue of the sky the fresh breeze through
the forest trees

JACK

Jack walks with Wolf as the latter cares for his herd as he

mr y

looks through THE BOOK OF GOOD FARMING

- JACK
Do you know about the Talisman Wolf

WOLF
Oh sure yes everybody who believes
in the Maia believe in the Talisman

JACK READS FROM THE BOOK

JACK
It was during the Great Initiaion
- that the Prince child was visited in a dream
by the spirit of his father
(Jack stops)
And the King gave the FILIUS REGIS
(aside)
Whatever that means
(reads)
three words which would guide him to
the Talisman And with this the Prince
knew where he might find the mighty
and divine power
(stops reading)
Yeah well I dont know What three words
(flips through)
Says “After twenty days in the Sunlight of
the Blasted Lands the Prince went
forth unto Alhambra and found
what indeed he had been in search of
And a new destiny he wrote
(stops reading)
Whats the Blasted Lands

WOLF

Oh no You dont wanna do that No sir

Men forcing people to take rocks
out of ground

JACK returns to the book flippin pages and skimming

JACK
Doesnt say what it is or where he finds it
Damn This thing reads like one of my
book reports - alot of information

WOLF

Jack stops as if the wind were knocked out of him Wolfs
expression changes from that of childish curiosity to sorrow

- WOLF

JACK
NOwait a minuteHow do you

WOLF
I can smell him on you He
talked about you all the time

WOLF
Your smell changed when I asked
about him He came with the other one
The one from Orris I was just

The other one stole some of us
Brought them over to your world
Thats a bad thing for a wolf
He gets bad mind Does bad things
Your father didnt know WOLF

He shook his head slowly His expression is that of a
child remembering a nightmare

WOLF Le
Bad He made himself a place
in this world my father said
Mostly he was in his Twinner
but he was from your world
We knew he was bad but who listens
to Wolfs Your father knew he was bad

WOLF

but not how bad

(then proudly)
He gave me these overalls he did
Oshkosh-by-gosh I wear‘em all the timeHe

HEY YOUGOD POUND ITGET BACK THERE

)

He runs after an errant cow-sheep Jack tries to absorb
all the new information He runs after Wolf who coaxes the
cow-sheep back to the fold

JACK
Are these yours

WOLF
HAhahahaNoThey HER cattle

JACK
Her You mean theyou mean Laura

WOLF
(nods)
Yes May she never never die

Co He awkwardly bends forward touching his right hand to his head
A Jack refrains from laughing

WOLF

and under all the skies above But

(PROUDLY)
job Me and mine have been
looking after them since begining
of it allSays so in Book of Good
Farming
(Jack reads for the passage)
I cant readBut I
know thats what it says WOLF

Wolf guides the herd back to the water for another drink
Jack sits down by the stream and flips through pages until

JACK
Here it isAnd the Wolf
shall protect the lamb
It shall protect the herd
until the Time of the Changes

JACK
During the Time of the Changes
it must flee to protect the herd
For be it known that any Wolf
who eats of the herd must be put
to death Whats The Time of Changes

WOLF

(Ushering the animals to the water)
Thats when the Moon fills up and
gets round We changeback into
our animal selves and go out to
eat for three daysWe dont
go near the herd though when we change
WOLF No sir When have places to go
when the moon is filled up So does

big moon

JACK
(cautiously asks)

Jack suddenly feels strange about his new friend

JACK
Butif you dont eat the herd

WOLF

This worries Jack Wolf says no more on the subject Jack
doesnt ask

WOLF
I wish I could read from the Good
BookMaybe you teach me huh
Jack nods as he inches away a bit He decides to remind him

JACK
ImIm glad you liked my Dad

WOLF
I did I did WOLF WOLF

Wolf stops His expression is strange - suddenly anxious

- JACK
Whats wrong Wol-

WOLF
Ssshhhh

Then Jack hears what Wolfs sensitive ears heard first

The cattle looked around and began to move away from the source
of the sound in a rough uneasy clot It sounded like a

RADIO SOUND EFFECT - someone ripping 4 bedsheet down the middle
very slowly Only the volume kept going up and up until

Jack thought he was going crazy

Wolf leaps to the herd who are begining to stumble and fall
into the stream and get mired in reeds and muddy-marsh One
cow-sheep has already tipped over and his baa-baaing for help
as it slowly drowns

WOLF
MY HERD

JACK
WOLF

Jack screams but Wolf cant hear him as he sees with amazement
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO THE AIR A PATCH OF IT ABOUT THREE
FEET OFF THE GROUND WAS RIPPLING AND BLISTERING SEEMING TO
TWIST AND PULL AT ITSELF - pulling the air like an open wound
SOMETHING SOMEONE IS COMING THROUGH FROM THE OTHER SIDE

Jack begins to run down the hill to Wolf

WOLF is down on his knees in the stream struggling to lift

the panicked animals out The first one floats limped and
mangled lazily down river

WOLF
GET UP GET UP GOD POUND YOU WOLF

Jack joins him in the strean

JACK ok
Wolf something comingWeve gotta-

WOLF
MY HERD JACKMY HERD

A CLAP OF THUNDER SHAKES THE EARTH This causes the rest of the

herd to back up into the water Wolf rages as he tries to prevent
them from going in - pulling at their necks pushing at their
bottoms Jacksees he must help Wolf to get him to come along

AND ALL THE WHILE THE RIPPING SOUND GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER

Jack falls face foward into the muddy stream as he tries to
lift one of the sheep The animal breaks loose from him and
throws him off-balance again when he hears A VOICE BELLOWING
OVER THE RIPPING SOUND It is the voice of MORGAN SLOAT

MORGAN
JACK -JAAAACK

Another THUNDER CLAP Jack looks to the rippling air and
begins TO SEE THROUGH ITas if through ripply badly made
glassHe can actually see through to the other side - to
HIS WORLD He sees Morgans limosine parked behind a gas
station He sees Morgan himself walking toward the ripping
seam of air

Jack shudders - both in fear and fascination as

MORGAN STEPS THROUGH THE HOLE BETWEEN THE TWO UNIVERSES

His face swimming and rippling as if made of limp plastic
He is clutching something around his neck - a small slivery
object As he steps through he undergoes a TRANSFORMATION
FROM MORGAN SLOAT TO MORGAN OF ORRIS - the droopy jowls
thin the thinning hair grows long the face gets taunt and
muscular the needy self-deluded eyes burn with pure
concentrated power and evil the cold weather parka changing
into the black cloak and hood

And the small slivery object turns into a LONG ROD TIPPED
WITH FIREA LIGHTENING ROD

JACK
Oh my God

MORGAN
JITAAAAAASSSOOOONNNNNN

Jack stumbles back into the water He sees Wolfs head going
under both hands waving as the herd trample over him

Jack begins to search his clothes for the BOTTLE OF TRAVELLING
LIQUID e

Morgan points the rod and BLUE FIRE shoots out over Jacks
shoulder sizzling the material of his clothes It strikes
one of the cow-sheep dead
WOLF
noooooo

Jack tries to keep Wolfs head above water Wolfs eyes are
glazed and water is streaming from his ears and nose His
lips are turning blue

MORGAN FIRES AGAIN

This time hitting a TREE ON THE BANK The tree falls directly
above Jack and Wolf in the water - but Jack manages to pull
Wolf under water and swim away from the trunk before it hit
They bob up to the surface in the midst of some weeds hidden
from the top of the hill which slopes down from the

meadow to the stream

Morgan can no-longer see them from his vantage point and
gallops towards the stream

Jack is trying to pull out his VIAL with one hand as he
holds on to WOLF with the other

WOLF
MY HERD THEYRE DYING

JACK
Hold on WolfJust hold on to me

Morgan stands at the top of the slope

MORGAN
JASON

Jack and Wolf look up to the towering BLACK FIGURE
At the same time that Jacks hand FINDS THE VIAL

MORGAN

ILL TEACH YOU TO GET IN MY WAY

YOU LITTLE BASTARD
MORGAN points his rod to the stream and SETS IT ON FIRE
The herd scream in fear and painWOLF SCREAMS FOR THEM
Morgan touches the ground with his red and sets the HILL
LEADING DOWN THE STREAM ON FIRE
Jack and Wolf are caught between two fires moving in on then
Jack tips the VIAL and manages to coat his finger But Wolf -
continuing to break free to save his herd - KNOCKS THE VIAL OF
REMAINING FLUID OUT OF JACKS HANDS AND INTO THE RIVER OF FIRE

JACK
noooco

But its too late The fire is moving in Jack grabs hold of
Wolfs neck with all his might and TOUCHES HIS FINGER TO
HIS FOREHEAD

Morgan sees this and is even more enraged HE SCREAMS and
points the rod at the spot where the two are flipping and
INCINERATES IT INSTANTLY

A TWO TRUCK HEAD-ON COLLISION

Morgans magic in the Territories resulted in a car crash in
ours The trucks burn beneath an OVERPASS UPON WHICH A TRAIN
RUNS ON A RAILWAY The train is heading for the overpass

that leads to a BRIDGE OVER A MUDDY STREAM beside the highway
Jack decides to head for the train

JACK
Come on Hurry

He grabs the screaming Wolf pulls him to his feet and runs
across the jammed highway to the other sideand hurry up
to the overpass to catch the on-coming train

EXT RAILWAY ON OVERPASS DAY

Jack pulls Wolf towards the tracks But Wolf out of his
element is terrified - he pulls back to resist

JACK

The train begins passing by Jack makes a move for it but
Wolfs pulls at his hand

WOLF

Suddenly this great big creature is pleading for Jacks
protection Jack acts sternly
- JACK
WELL THEN COME ON OR I WILL
LEAVE YOU

ONCE AGAIN THEY BEGIN TO HEAR THE RIPPING SOUND AS MORGAN
TRIES TO RE-ENTER OUR WORLD

Wolf looks at Jack then at the train then back at Jack
Suddenly HE PICKS JACK UP THROWS HIM OVER HIS SHOULDER AND
RUNS FOR THE TRAIN LIKE A LINEBACKERJack yells

JACK
GRAB ONTO IT

WOLF RUNS ALONGSIDE THE TRAIN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO GRAB
He finds a NARROW STEEL PIPE that leads to the roof and

SEIZES IT flinging his body and Jacks onto the side of the
trainThen with incredible strength He hoists Jack above
his head with his free hand allowing Jack to clasp on and the
two climb up the pipe to the roof of the train

CUT TO
EXT TOP OF TRAIN - DAY

Jack and Wolf are wet and cold as the train speeds along

But Wolf is shivering more from fear Jack notices that Wolf
has changed a bit in our world He is still wearing the bib-
overalls but instead of a homespun canvas shirt underneath
he wears a blue chambray On his feet which once were bare
are sneakers with no socks And on his face a pair of ROUND
STEEL RIMMED SPECTACLES - the kind John Lennon used to wear

JACK
Wolfdo you have trouble seeing
in the Territories
WOLF
I didnt know I did I see better
with these glass eyes
He looks around at the FACTORY LINED HORIZON He says sadly

WOLF
Better than I want to

He lowers his head Jack feels badly for getting him involved
He moves over to Wolf and puts his arm around hin

JACK
Its 0K Wolf

Wolf lowers his head to Jacks shoulder

WOLF
When can we go back Jack

JACK
Do you know how to flip Wolf

Then I dont know

EXT INTERSTATE - DAY
Jack and Wolf are hitchhiking although Wolf seems not to like
the idea They stand beside the sign WELCOME TO INDIANA
Cars and fourwheeler trucks pass them by as the day moves on
LATER THAT DAY

Finally AN OLD FORD TRUCK slows down and Jack runs
to the passenger door Wolf follows reluctantly behind

A MAN with a sickly ashen expression is behind the wheel
Jacks face registers something not right about the MAN but
he smiles in spite of it

MAN
How far you going

JACK
Far as you can take us

Man looks them over a moment Wolf stares at the Man intently

MAN
Hop in

JACK
Thanks

Jack gets in first But Wolf remains still

JACK
Come on Wolfget in

Wolf slowly shakes his head as his eye stare at the floor

JACK
Wolf Get in or Im leaving you here

Wolf looks up at him with such a hurt expression Jack feels
awful He changes his tone

Cc

Wolf shakes his head Finally the Man says angrily

Jack steps out
Wolf angrily

WOLF

He was dying

WOLF

Its the worst smell When people

the Black Disease It eats you up
bit by bit from the inside

JACK
(considering this he adds)
We call it cancer

Jack remembering his mom starts to get sad and hopeless

WOLF
I dont know if I can hitch Ill

but inside

Jack starts walking away from Wolf in a daze - like part of
him is surrendering to the futility of it all Wolf worries

WOLF
Dont leave me JackPlease
You wont leave me here will you-

JACK
IM NOT LEAVING YOU SO JUST
SHUT-UP ABOUT THAT

Wolf is startled by Jacks frustrated anger

WOLF
Im sorry Im not good God Pound me

He pats Wolf on the side Wolf is so happy he picks Jack up
and swings him onto his back

WOLF
JACK LIKES WOLF I KNOW

JACK
WOLF Relax

WOLF

Come on We go far
I can run far with you on my back

He picks Jack up and adjusts him on his backJack looks

down at WOLFS HANDS as they adjust Jacks legs around his neck

NONEHe looks up to the sky and sees the sun begin to set
CUT TO

EXT WIDE OPEN FIELD - NIGHT

The two have camped in the ruins of a burned out house with a
field on one side and a copse of woods on the other

CUT TO
INT BURNED OUT HOUSE - NIGHT
Jack sits on what once was a kitchen floor trying to get warn
He is shivering and coughing He is sick He looks worried as
he glances up to the moon which is growing fuller

A WOLFS HOWL is HEARD and Jack freezes with fright
He hears a creak in the other roon

“)

JACK
Wolf is that you
No answer He slowly moves toward the room dreading what he
might find He stands in the broken doorway and calls

JACK
Wolf Are you

A GROWLING IS HEARD in the dark of the roomJack is paralyzed
He hears the source of the growling coming toward him

JACK FINDS THE STRENGTH TO TURN AND RUNBACK THROUGH THE
KITCHEN AND RIGHT INTO -

WOLF whose face has a rough unshaven look as hair
begins to grow there

WOLF
Jack

JACK
AAAAHHHH

Jack falls back to the floor and crawls backwards At the same
time A PRAIRIE DOG bursts from the dark room Wolf and Jack

see it Wolf picks up a big stick from a broken chair and hurdles
it at the dog

WOLF
GET OUT HERE YOUGO WAY OUT

The dog is frightened by the roar and the stick and leaps through
a window frame without any glass and runs away

Jack is shaking - from fear as well as from sickness
WOLF
Im sorry I shouldnt have taken
so long

He bends down and picks up a bunch of plants and roots

JACK
Whats all that

WOLF
Medicine

JACK

Medicine What you do mean

WOLF
Youre sick Going to get worse
- if you dont take medicineWe
need clean waterTheres a well
out behind a farm right across the field
Ill go sneak over and you-

JACK
NO Ill go

Jack finds a beer and exits

CcuUT TO

INT BURNED OUT HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Wolf has started a fire and is mixing the roots of the plants
in the beercan of water over the fire Jack sits with a half
charred blanket hating the smell

JACK
That stuff stinks

WOLF
So do you

JACK

Im not drinking that

WOLF
You have to or you smell worse

JACK
Wolf this isnt the Terrirtories
Remember This is the Country of
Bad Smells (HE SNEEZES)youve propably
got ragweed and poison oak and

WOLF
Theyre good things Not very strong
God pound them but not everything
bad hereThere are good smells
too - like the medicine plants
Even though theyre weak I bet they
were stronger once I bet this was a
good place onceClean and full of
power

JACK
Wolf The hairs come back on your palms
Even your face all of a sudden looks unshaven
And that howling I heard Was that

Interrupting Wolf demeanor changes to a graver tone

- WOLF
The time is coming I went running
with the moon when I looked for
the medicine It was beautiful
(He faces glows)
But well have tohave to
find some placeYou have to lock
me up someplace Lock me up good If I get
out I hurt anything I can run down
and catch hold of So you lock me
up three days maybe four until
- moon lets go of me

Jack listens with great focus

JACK
Wellwell look in the next town for
a hardware store to buy a lock or something

WOLF
Everything be all right
(picking up can)
You just drink your medicine
Thats all you have to do now

He hands Jack the can Jack takes it suspiciously
JACK
You know if this kills me youll
be all alone
An expression of terrible distress comes over Wolf
WOLF
I dont want to hurt you Jack
I never want to hurt you

Jack knows this in his heart but he fears changes are coming
He drinks the liquid quickly

JACK
Ugh

Suddenly the room starts to spin and HE FEELS HIMSELF SLIPPING
INTO ANOTHER WORLDThe world begins to waver just like it
does before a flip

JACK
WOLF TAKE MY HAND

‘

Wolf grabs his hand but just at that moment the world grew solid
around him The wavering stopped
WOLF a
Jack what is it so a

JACK
Nothing II feel a little better though

EXT WOODSHED - DAY
A abandonded woodshed in a dirty little gully It is surrounded
by trash and bald tires Jack approaches the shed carrying a
paper bag
JACK

WolfWolf Im back

He looks inside the woodshed then walks around the shed

JACK
Wolf are you here

But Wolf is nowhere to be seen

JACK
Shit

He looks up to the sky and sees THE SUN IS STARTING TO SET

He looks at his watch It is almost six oclock on October 30
Jack gets worried He starts moving toward a ditch that borders
the field He then he looks towards the woods that lie on the
perimeter of the field

ay

POV
The woods across the field look still Tall trees Big rocks

Jack doesnt know what to do Then suddenly looking out towards
the woods HE SEES

ONE OF THE BIG ROCKS starts to move Jack realizes IT WAS NOT A
ROCKIT WAS WOLF SITTING VERY STILL IN A HUNCHED POSITION
HE stands up and begins walking towards Jack

Jack stands stock still as he notices that

WOLF HAS CHANGED EVEN MORE His hair has become thick longer
more luxuriant His beard is full His entire body seems wider
and more powerful And as he gets closer to Jack the later

can see that his eyes are ablaze as if filled with liquid fire

Wolf stops on the opposite side of the ditch His voice has
lost its child like quality It is deep and resonant

WOLF
Soon now Jack

JACK
I thought for a second you ran away

WOLF
Was sitting Remembering Thinking

Everytime he talks Jack can see how large his TEETH have become

JACK
II got the lockWhat
were you thinking about

Wolf stares at Jack his whole face eyes teeth everything
blazing - like a man on LSD with an altered consciousness

WOLF
Youre the herd now Jack

He walks round the ditch to Jack who backs up cautiously
Wolf is exultant
WOLF
You have good smells in this world Jack
Good smells WOOLF

JACK

You never said anything good about
it before

WOLF
Before was before and now is now

JACK
I hope none of those good smells

He leads Wolf around the shed as he speaks fervently

JACK

They arrive at the door of the shed Jack pulls out the PADLOCK
and the KEY

And close it then turn the key

Wolf staring at the sky just nods

JACK

WOLF

He points to a spot about a foot away from the door inside the
shed Jack sits Wolf walks out a foot outside the door and

sits Then without even looking at Jac
HAND (which is now a PAW) to Jack Jack
Wolf squeeze it and Jack almost screams
face lifted up towards the sky

JACK
Are we going to stay like

WOLF
Until its time

THE SUN is becoming a faint line of light

Jack is getting more frightened by the seco
an almost meditative calm

THE NIGHT SKY appears faintly lit by the sei ug si
SUDDENLY Wolf speaks as if in a trance never look

WOLF

JACK

He tries to pull his hand away but WOlf resists J
harder and finally Wolf releases him - but with a é¢

JACK
Remember Keep the herd safe

Wolfs eyes glare for a moment He speaks as if on

WOLF
The herd goes in the barn and lock

injure his herd

Jack backs up into the middle of the darkened shed
and reaches for the door

JACK
Put the lock on the door

WOLF

ON THE GOD POUNDED DOOR SEE

HE SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT WITH A BANG THROWING JACK AND THE SHED
INTO COMPLETE DARKNESS Jack moves to the door and says

JACK

WOLF (0S)
Ged pounding key right here and now

We hear the click of the clock and the rattling of the key in
the cylinder A second later THE KEY IS BOUNCED UNDER THE DOOR
INTO THE SHED Jack breathes a sigh of relief As he bends down
for the key he can see beneath the door

WOLFS FEET COMPLETELY COVERED IN HAIR
He rises quickly He leans at the door and whispers

JACK

WOLFS FIST BANGS ON THE DOOR

WOLF (0S)

JACK
«-On that second day of the changes

He flips through the pages back to the small passage his Father
wrote on the first page of the book

BANG BANG BANG as Wolf strikes the door incessantly
tremendous force Jack fear collapses his legs and his
to the floor and scurries over to the far end against 1
opposite the door He watches as -

THE DOORS ARE BEING PUSHED AGAINST THEIR HINGES with ev
hit of Wolfs body

Jack is panicked he picks up a broken WOOD BEAM to def
himself then realizes thats ridiculous He then rushes

door and props the wood beam against wedging the other end
into the dirtHe backs away to his place on the far side
tripping overhis feet and fallilng to the dirt floor When
he hands touchs the soft dirt HE GETS AN IDEAHe begins to
dig and claw at the dirt to make a hole under the wall and
squeeze out

Wolf keeps GROWLING and POUNDING at the door but the wood beam
is proving strong

Jack digs frantically the hole widening He digs right to
the bottom of the wall and then begins clearing the dirt
away from itHe picks up a stick and breaks up the dirt
then cups it with his hands and tosses it away

The wood beam begins to crack in the middle Wolf is growling
now with tremendous ferocity

Jack has made a clearing beneath the wall He enters his hole
headfirst and begins to clear dig away at the earth as he crawls
under and out

SUDDENLY THE BEAM BREAKS IN HALFAND THE BANGING STOPS

Jack freezes There is nothing protecting the door now
He digs at his hole as fast as his hands can move clearing
the dirt behind himDigging and digging until

WOLFS PAW BREAKS THROUGH JACKS HOLE AND GRABS HOLD OF JACKS
THROATJACK cant breath He grabs hold of the paw and tries
to pry it open Meanwhile WOLFS OTHER PAW IS QUICKLY DIGGING
around the arm that holds Jack to make the hole big enough to
pull him outJACK BEATS AT THE PAW ON HIS THROAT UNTIL
FINALLY HE MANAGES TO GET HIS TEETH ON IT AND BITES DOWN HARD

WOLF SCREAMS IN PAIN and for a split second relaxes his grip
Jack seizes the moment and PULLS HIS HEAD OUT OF THE HOLE BACK
INSIDE THE SHED He kicks and pushes all the dirt back into the
hole as he races against Wolfs tremendous strength and digging
further into the shed

Jack rises and runs to the front door trying to bang it open
He looks back and SEES

WOLFS FULL ARM UP TO HIS SHOULDER IS NOW THROUGH THE
SECOND ARM COMES THROUGH and BOTH PAWS grab into thé wall
as if Wolf were on his back and trying to slide his way under

JACK STARTS DIGGING AGAIN THIS TIME UNDER THE DOOR which has

a much wider space to begin with between the ground and the door
WOLF ‘S GROWLING SEEMS TO BE GETTING CLOSER AND LOUDER

Jack digs and digs and digs until
A BEAM OF LIGHT ENTERS THROUGH THE HOLE as he breaks through
to the other side IT IS THE SUN But Jack pays no attention
he keeps digging until he notices that WOLFS GROWLING AS
STOPPED The silence is even more frightening He slowly
turns his head expecting to see Wolf standing menacingly
above him and sees

AN EMPTY SHED The two arms of Wolf that has broken through
are gone Suddenly the shed is filled with THIN STREAMS OF
SUNLIGHT as THE DAWN BREAKS THROUGH

He listens for Wolf but hears nothing Then very gently

- gack WOLF (0S)

out the remaining dollar and change He then Lifts his shirt
and pulls out the BLACK BOOK which Singer grabs immediately

Jack and Wolfwalk down a long corridor in the midst of the other

through two big doors into a massive dining hall with rows of
tables and benches Morning light streams in through tall
Victorian windows Wolf immediately smells food and his lead

by his nose to a place closest the kitchen Jack follows

GARDENER
Let us have a dozen confessions

is food for our souls And what
is the best nourishment for our souls

BOYS
DISCIPLINE ORDER OBEDIENCE

GARDENER
Amen Who would like to start
Several hands shoot up Jack is impressed by how eager the boys
are to confess Gardener was hoping Jack would raise his hand
but knew better He calls on a gawky pimply teenager who stands

GARDENER
Roy Owderfelt

ROY
I stole ten bucks from my mommas
purse last year I took it and
played it on the video games
It was the money momma put aside
for the gas bill Because of that
they turned off our heat And

to the hospital with pneumonia
because I stole that money

GARDENER

CUT TO
INT THE CELLAR CHAPEL - NIGHT
A TV STUDIO with velvet trimmed pews To the left of the stage is
a glassed-in techinical sound booth manned by Casey On the stage
is a GIANT GOLD CROSS which serves as a backdrop
The boys file in and take their seats Gardener enters adorned

like a humble prophet He wears a simple smock and no shoes
He takes his place at the podium and looks out at his flock

He spots Jack and Wolf at once He stares at them dead-eyed
until CASEY GIVES HIM THE SIGNAL AND HE IMMEDIATELY BECOMES
ANIMATED in front of the cameras

GARDENER
Fret not thyself because of evildoers
Neither be thou envious against the
workers of inequity For they shall
be cut down like the grass and wither
as the green herbFor evildoers
shall be cut off but those that wait
upon the Lord they shall inherit
the Territories

Jack listens with growing apprehension

GARDENER
Do you understand what this lovely
song Pslam 37 means boys
(Clearly they dont)
(suddenly shockingly)
IT MEANS DONT SWEAT IT
Now you know what that means dont you

BOY
YEAH
GARDENER
‘o OH YEAH DONT SWEAT IT NEGATIVE

PERSPIRATION It says you dont
have to WORRY about evildoers
You dont have to WORRY about
the workers of sin and inequity
This Pslam says if you WALK with
the Lord and TALK with the Lord
EVERYTHINGG GONNA BE SO COOL
Do you understand that boys

BOYS
YEAH AMEN

GARDENER
Naw you dont have to fear that
kid who wants to show you the
dirty picture books You dont
have to fear that boy who says
just one toke on just one joint
wont hurt you and youll be a sissy
if you dont take it Oh NO CAUSE
WHEN YOU GOT THE LORD YOU GONNA
WALK WITH THE LORD AM I RIGHT

BOYS

YEAH
GARDENER
I CANT HEAR YOU AM I RIGHT
BOYS
YEEEAHHHH
GARDENER

But be on the look out Because

we have enemies Oh yes theyre
out there We have our enemies
Twice the State of Kansas has tried
to shut me down They cant stand
to think of me down here at the
Sunlight Home teaching my boys to
love Jesus and love their country
It makesem mad but you wanna know
something boys We dont just makeem
madWE MAKEEM SCAARRED

BOYS
YEAH AMEN

GARDENER
Letem send down their spies to plant
garbage under our kitchen counters
and cockroaches in our flour Letem
start their vile rumors that my boys
are beaten ARE YOU BEATEN

BOYS
NO

GARDENER
They sent down some smart news reporters
from some them radical humanists to do
a hatchet job on the Sunlight Home
But we outsmartedem didnt we boys They
idnt find one boy chained or in
confined in a strait jacket or
with his head shaved like they heard
in town from some of them School Board
Jackals Most they could find was
some boys who said they got spanked
and THEY DID GET SPANKED’- Id testify
to that myself before the Throne of
the Almighty with a lie detector on each
arm because the Book says if you SPARE
the ROD you gonna SPOIL the CHILD and
if you believe that you gimme a hallelujah

BOYS
HALLELUJAH

GARDENER

They found HAPPY boys They found
HEALTHY boys The Lord PROTECTS
those that love him and the Lord is
not gonna let a bunch of dope smoking
radical humanists who tattletaled to
those so-called news people tear
us down I heard the lies on that
Tv show and I knew who ‘spread‘em cause
when youve fed a boy and held him

- in your arms when he cries for his
momma at night I guess then you
you know his voice even when they try
and cover his face with some fancy
tech-no-logical de-vice

(staring at Jack)

Those boys are gone now May God
Forgive them Because I cannot
For I am just a man And I will protect
this flock I set those evildoers
out - into the Territories where
they shall not be fed - but
may in fact be eaten up by trees
that walk like beasts in the night
through the Blasted Lands

Jack and Wolf know that this fancy imagery isnt just imagery

GARDENER
Let us pray

GARDENER bows his head and BEGINS TO PRAY IN LATIN Within this
prayer HE UTTERS THE PHRASE FILIUS REGIS meaning ROYAL SON

Upon hearing the phrase JACK PERKS UP He remembers it from
the passage in the Book of Good Farming Recalling the three
words were a language he didnt understand Until now

He mumurs to himself

JACK
Latin Its Latin

He sees a phone and is tempted to call his mother but thinks
twice He turns to leave when he gets an idea He searches the
bookcases for a LATINENGLISH DICTIONARY He searches quickly
and with great trepidation He finger skims the larger books
until it hits upon a LARGE GREEN FOLIO EDITION OF A LATIN
ENGLISH DICTIONARY He attempts to pull the book out when HIS
EYE CATCHES SOMETHING ON THE SHELF ABOVE THE BOOK THAT CAUSES
HIM TO FREEZE IN TERROR

EXT THE BLASTED LANDS - NIGHT -
Jack and Wolf are horrified by what they see
THE SKY LOOKS LIKES ITS ON FIRE THE EARTH IS POTTED AND

ALL DUG UP LIKE A NUCLEUR BOMB HAD STRUCK EVERYTHING IS BLACK
AND CHARRED NO TREES NOTHING GREEN NO HILLS OR MOUNTAINS

IT LOOKS LIKE A SCENE FROM DANTES INFERNO

WOLF
The Blasted Lands

Wolf holds on to Jacks hand and forces him to lay low on the
ground so as not to be seen From the ground they watch

THE ENTIRE LAND IS BEING MINED HUGE CRATERS OF EARTH HAVE BEEN
DUG UP AND WORKERS CRAWL OUT CARRYING GLOWING ROCKS OF
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL THEY PUT THEM IN BARRELS WHICH ARE THEN
MOVED BY A SECOND TEAM OF WORKERS TO A OMINOUS LOOKING FACTORY
OF BLACK SMOKE AND TALL TOWERS (IT IS THE SCENE OUT OF JACKS
NIGHTMARES) -

Jack and Wolf are in tears as they watch

THE WORKERS Some are Territories people Some are Priests Some
are BOYS FROM THE SUNLIGHT SCHOOL as we can tell from their
blackened white turtlenecks with the name tags But what is
most horrific about them is that due to the radioactive

nature of the material THEY ARE ALL DEFORMED in some way

Huge blisters miamed arms and hands burnt off hair and skin
It is a nightmare of egological diaster It is hell on earth

The workers are ordered about by GUARDS that look like TWO-LEGGED
BEASTSJack looks to one of them and recognizes him as

HECTOR BASTS TWINNER - same expression same eyes same build
He is sure Singer and Casey are around as well

JACK
We have to go back WolfWe cant
stay here either

GARDENER

No noon the contrary a young

valuable soldier if he could be directed
away from energies that confuse and
leads him astrayOr perhaps it would
be easier to eliminate the energies

Youve been to the Other Side that
I hear so much That place Mr Sloat
speaks of with such admiration

GARDENER
(Jack is about to speak)

“ No need to deny it My loudspeakers

When I was young I spake as a
childI understood as a child
I thought as a child but when I
became a man I put away childish
things

He looks up and realizes He begins to search for a particular
box He moves frantically from one to the next - shoving aside
china books picture frames bed linenuntil he comes upon
a box marked JACKS THINGS He pulls the box down to the floor

He opens the box and the first thing he finds is THE LITTLE
REMOTE CONTROL TAXI he knew as a child He puts it aside and
takes out some other artifacts from his childhood - toy train
rubber ball an Etcha-Sketch old notebooks baseball cards

He stops He sees a SMALL NARROW ITEM WRAPPED UP IN PAPER

He picks it up On the side is scribbled in a childs handwriting
DADDYS PEN Jack unwraps the paper to reveal THE BEAUTIFUL GOLD
PEN HIS FATHER WAS WRITING WITH THE DAY HE DIED

As Jack holds the pen he senses something He remembers the
passage he read with Wolf from the Book of Good Farming

JACK (V0)
-After twenty days in the Blasted
Lands the Prince went forth unto
Alhambra and found what indeed he
had been in search of And a new
destiny HE WROTE

now has been recording his history as hes experienced it He
now reads the only words on the page

And the Prince took the Talisman
AN WFOTE cc ccccresccccccccecee”

Nothing more is there Carefully Jack lifts the pen and touches
it to the page Beads of sweat gather on his forehead The
overwhelming pressure of having the power to write what fate
will occur
