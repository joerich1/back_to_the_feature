INT DAISY’S HOUSE BATHROOM DAY 1938

A young woman in a white nightgown Daisy stands in front of
the mirror over the sink tooth brush stuck in her mouth she
has stopped brushing and looks at her reflection

DAISY VO
Back then this is years ago I
couldnt afford secrets I just had
chores

With toothbrush in mouth she moves her hair around trying it
one way then another
INT DAISY’S HOUSE AUNT’S BEDROOM DAY

Daisy dressed on her knees helps her elderly Aunt pull her
stockings up over her thick legs

DAISY VO
As a child growing up we had been
rich And then -- well we weren’t

EXT DAISY’S HOUSE PORCH DAY

Daisy comes out onto the porch followed by two Scottie dogs
the screen door slams shut behind her The dogs start barking
at the noise she ignores them

DAISY VO
And like most people during the
Depression I now lived each day as
it came no longer expecting
anything

She carries an empty milk bottle with her foot -- she’s done
this so many times before - she flips open the top lid of a
white wooden box on the porch She takes out full milk
bottle from the box replacing it with the empty one

INT DAISY’S HOUSE KITCHEN DAY

Daisy stirs a pot of hot cereal on the stove as she stares
at the coffee percolating in the little glass bubble on the
top of the coffee pot

DAISY VO
Waiting -- for nothing

The Aunt at the table turns a page of a tired-looking well-
thumbed and old magazine
INT DAISY’S HOUSE HALLWAY DAY

The telephone in the hallway begins to ring and two Scottie
dogs suddenly start barking

DAISY VO
And then

The Aunt looks at Daisy wondering who that could be

INT DAISY’S HOUSE HALLWAY DAY
Daisy answers the telephone

DAISY
(into the phone)
Hello Yes What
(to the yapping dogs)
Sh-sh Be quiet
(into the phone)
Sinus

INT DAISY’S HOUSE KITCHEN DAY

Daisy takes the pot off the stove and begins to serve them
her mind far away The dogs are yapping

DAISY
(to the dogs)
Sh-sh
AUNT

(seeing her face)
Did someone die

DAISY
No No one died

INT DAISY’S BEDROOM DAY

DAISY rifles through clothes on hangers in her closet she
takes out a dress on a hanger holds it up looks it over

DAISY VO

Mother called that day Maybe not
even the tenth
INT DAISY’S HOUSE STAIRCASE LIVING ROOM DAY
Daisy descends the stairs

She peeks around the corner and smiles nervously at her
Aunt sitting in the living room

DAISY
I won’t be long

As Daisy disappears the Aunt struggles to get herself up and
out of her chair

EXT DAISY’S HOUSE PORCH DAY

A large car is parked in front of the house an Aide stands
by the passenger door and doffs his hat to Daisy

EXT DAISY’S HOUSE CAR DAY

Once in Daisy turns back toward the house sees her Aunt
peeking out around the lace curtain in the window

The Aunt nervously ‘waves’ Daisy smiles nervously and gives
a very faint wave back

DAISY VO
But I was around

The car begins to drive off

INT CAR DAY
The car drives down a long tree-lined driveway

Daisy sits in the backseat her hands nicely folded on her
lap She stares straight ahead

DAISY VO
His Mother said he needed someone
to take his mind off his work Why
she thought I could do that I had
no idea

DAISY
(after a nervous sigh to
the driver)
Were fifth -- or sixth cousins
Depends on how you count
DRIVERAIDE
I suppose he’s related to half of
everybody up here
(looks at her through the
mirror reaches into his
pocket)
Cigarette

DAISY
No No I don’t Thanks

Aide puts his cigarettes away She looks out the window

DAISY VO
I figured I’d spend the afternoon
there and after having thoroughly
bored him to death go quietly back
to my quiet life

EXT DRIVEWAY CONTINUOUS

The car pulls up in front of a mansion Springwood Other
cars and a few military vehicles are parked along the drive
A few cars drive off others are arriving - this seems to be
a busy place

INT HALLWAY DAY

AN AIDE leads Daisy down the hallway which is full of people
working sitting at make-shift desks speaking in hushed and
important-sounding voices Others are typing Aide 3 is
speaking on the telephone in French Daisy has to step over the
phone cables that run across the floor No one pays any
attention to her

DAISY VO
But that’s not what happened

A door opens down the hall and a man comes out with a piece
of paper and practically runs down the hall Daisy has to
get out of his way The Aide leads her by the arm now

AIDE
Hes not been feeling well Sinuses

Daisy nods she knows this
AIDE

Seems to happen every time the
second he comes home
They reach an imposing door and the

opens the door

AIDE
Mr President

Aide knocks waits then

The Aide guides Daisy into the study DAISY is hesitant

INT

STUDY DAY

FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT sits behind his desk turned away lost in
deep even profound thought DAISY enters and the door is closed
behind her All the bustle of the hallway is gone All we can

hear is the tic of the clock on the mantelpiece

She stands self-conscious

He continues to concentrate The warm glow of the desk isolates

him

Lost in some other world he takes off his
his eyes a lonely sigh

rare peek into the toll his office takes

She nervously waits for him to notice her Then

Franklin swivels his chair around and sees her
doesn’t recognize her

FRANKLIN
Daisy What a rare treat I hope my
mother didnt force this on you

DAISY
She said everyone else was away

FRANKLIN
Did she She shouldn’t have said
that How nice to see you How long
has it been

DAISY
Oh years The Dows’ wedding sir
In Rhinebeck

FRANKLIN
Oh were you there

DAISY
Where would you like me to sit

FRANKLIN
There’s tea I think there’s
still tea Will you

glasses rubs

-- unaware that anyone is watching this

she coughs

at first he
She goes and pours tea for herself

Franklin opens a desk drawer takes out a flask Before he
can pour he touches his forehead closes his eyes reaches
for his handkerchief and blows his nose -- painfully Daisy
watches all of this with interest He then pours liquor into
his tea

FRANKLIN
I can do this because my mothers not
here

He laughs

She doesn’t believe in sinus
medicine

He looks at her then decides not to offer and puts the
flask back in the drawer

FRANKLIN
(sips his tea)
That’s better Do you collect stamps
Daisy

DAISY
I - dont

He reaches across his desk and picks up a large stamp album
and a magnifying glass

FRANKLIN
Come and look at these

She politely goes to the desk looks for a chair finds one
and brings it to in front of the desk where Franklin
magnifying glass in hand has begun looking over his stamps

He hands her the magnifying glass

Daisy ‘studies’ the stamps through the magnifying glass --
there are stamps of rich colors and exotic and distant places
and peoples

She turns the page -- and the stamps on this page are of
people of today --General Franco Josef Stalin Haile
Selassie of Ethiopia Mussolini of Italy and so forth

DAISY
I suppose you’ve met pretty much
everyone of these

She looks closely at a stamp of Hitler through the magnifying
glass
FRANKLIN
Not every one Not yet
DAISY
Theyre -- fascinating

The door opens and a secretary MISSY enters without
knocking She carries a file On seeing Daisy

MISSY
Excuse me I should have knocked

She sets a paper in front of him As he signs Missy briefly
looks over Daisy who is pretending to look at the stamps

FRANKLIN
As he skims the letter
to Missy incredulous)
I actually wrote this
Missy just waits then to

Daisy)
My cross Daisy is that I am too
nice

To Missy)
But -- we need the Senator’s vote

Don’t we Why can’t politicians
just be honest

He smiles at Daisy then
as he signs explaining
Daisy to Missy)

My cousin

Missy ‘smiles’ at her and Daisy smiles back

As she continues to study the stamps she hears the door
close and Missy leave Then she notices Franklin looking at
her She turns to a page of the album Franklin leans over
and looks

FRANKLIN
Those are from Africa

She slowly turns the pages

They say thats the highest
waterfall in the world

She turns another page and stops--

Daisy looks at the stamps then looks at him smiles She
turns the page and looks at a stamp
DAISY
(seriously and proper)
I understand Africa can get very
hot

She looks at him She makes him smile

FRANKLIN
Very hot Daisy

When sees him smiling she likes this -- she’s doing what
she’s supposed to be doing She turns the page

Franklin once again presses his fingers to his forehead --
relieving the sinuses

She watches him concerned

DAISY
Would you like me to go

FRANKLIN
No Please I wouldn’t

Franklin sips his spiked tea lights a cigarette -- both of
which make him feel better for a moment and so he turns his
attention back to enjoying watching Daisy look at the stamp
album

DAISY
(pointing out a stamp)
This one’s pretty I’d like to go
there

FRANKLIN
Where is that

DAISY
Well To be honest I’d like to go
almost anywhere

This makes him laugh
DAISY VO

The President spent a lot of time
that spring in Hyde Park-on-Hudson

EXT DRIVEWAY FRONT OF HOUSE DAY
President Roosevelts motorcade is arriving A flurry of

excitement as aides hurry out of their cars before they have
even stopped and rush to go and set up
DAISY VO
In Europe there would certainly be
another war one we would be
dragged into whether we liked it
or not

Franklin smiles in the passenger seat of a limousine as his
Mother and servants come out to greet him

DAISY VO
Here at home he said everyone was
just shouting at each other

Daisy stands under a tree at a distance watching all the
excitement of his arrival

DAISY VO
So the President spent an awful lot
of time that spring in Hyde Park On
Hudson He said -- I helped him
forget --

Daisy waves to Franklin

DAISY VO
-- ‘the weight of world’

INT STUDY DAY

A microphone is being set up on Franklins desk by
technicians as he looks over a speech Franklin’s Mother
straightens her son’s tie smooths his hair fusses with his
collar -- still taking care of her boy

FRANKLIN
(a joke to the
technicians)
Will someone please tell her --
it’s radio

The technicians laugh Mother keeps fussing

DAISY VO
His Mother said he’d run the whole
country from here if he could

A crowd has formed in the open doorway to listen to his
speech

DAISY VO
But he couldn’t Not with how
things were -- so many people out
of work

AIDE
Quiet please

FRANKLIN
I think that means you Mother

INT KITCHEN DAY
A radio is on in the kitchen

FRANKLIN’S VOICE
(on the radio)
But I know many of you have lost
your jobs or have seen your friends
or members of your families lose
their jobs

In the kitchen five or six servants stand paying rapt
attention to the radio broadcast

DAISY’S VO
Everyone scared No one knowing
what was going to happen

INT HALLWAY DAY

We move out of the kitchen and through the living room where
military men sit listening to a large radio

FRANKLIN’S VOICE
(on the radio)
and I do not propose that the
Government shall pretend not to see
these things

INT LIVING ROOM STUDY DAY

We move down the hallway and Franklin’s voice on the radio
gets fainter and fainter until we reach a group of staff and
servants in the study’s doorway and through these craning
necks and bobbing heads we see Franklin giving the chat into
the microphone

FRANKLIN
But I conceive the first duty of
government is to protect the
economic welfare of all the people
in all sections and in all
groups

DAISY VO
And everyone looking to him

Daisy sits in a corner arm chair magnifying glass in hand
looking at stamps while listening to Franklin make his
broadcast

EXT LAWN DAY

In front of the house the President sits in a chair on the
steps as a local German-American brass band (lederhosen
etc) under a banner (Hyde Park German-American Friendship
Society”) plays for him

DAISY VO
And even here he couldn’t get
completely away They all wanted
something from him The local labor
union the Hyde Park Chamber of
Commerce the German-American
Friendship Band

He catches sight of Daisy in the crowd of servants and staff
watching the band from the driveway

DAISY VO
And all he wanted -- was to relax

He smiles and winks at her

INT FRANKLIN’S CAR DAY

Franklin drives He pushes a button on a small contraption
and a lit cigarette appears as if by magic

Daisy is with him in the passenger seat

DAISY VO
That spring I learned to smoke

Daisy takes the lit cigarette out of the contraption starts
to hand it to Franklin but impulsively takes a puff first
herself then smiling she gives the cigarette to him

EXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY

Another day They drive down a country road through a wood
where trees are being lumbered Following behind them is a
State Trooper car

DAISY VO
Each time he came home he’d
telephone and ask Daisy where
would you like to go today And I
would always answer -- ‘anywhere’

EXT HILLY ROAD DAY

Another day The car climbs the hill with the police car
right behind

DAISY VO

DAISY VO

He’d had the car built so it could
be driven with just the hands

A Police Car follows Franklin’s car

DAISY VO

INT FRANKLIN’S CAR DAY

Franklin drives the car up a very bumpy road Franklin has
his left arm out the window and with his left hand he is
gesturing behind him -- waving the police escort away Daisy
doesn’t see this

Daisy turns and looks back where she sees the police car
pulling off the road and turning around

She turns back to Franklin as he drives

DAISY
Where’s the police car going

EXT BUMPY PATH DAY

Franklin maneuvers the car up a steep dirt road in the woods
The car shakes from the bumps

FRANKLIN
Oh they dont follow all the time
Sometimes they have to go and catch
a crook or something I suppose
He laughs Daisy laughs

The car continues up through the woods and comes to a slow
stop on the hillside overlooking the valley

INT FRANKLIN’S CAR DAY

Franklin turns off the engine For a moment there is only the
sound of the birds and the wind

DAISY
What a lovely spot Weve not been
here before

FRANKLIN
No Ive been saving this

DAISY
What a beautiful view

As she looks off he leans over and turns on the car radio

DAISY
I like this song

As the song plays Franklin smiles one of his big smiles at
Daisy then dispenses a lit cigarette from the little

machine He puffs The cigarette smoke curls out of the car
as they listen

Daisy is lost in the song in the view in the swirling smoke

she hums along with the song Then she notices that Franklin is
looking at her he takes her hand in his He her puts her hand
on his thigh And leaves it there

Daisy looks down at her hand on Franklin’s thigh She looks at
him looking out the window smoking

He takes her hand and puts it on his groin

She hesitates then begins to unbutton his trousers checking to
see if he objects or if this is what he wants

He just looks off smoking Then without looking he helps by
unbuckling his belt

From the perspective of the backseat it soon becomes clear that
she is rubbing him masturbating him

He closes his eyes bites his lip as he looks off into the
woods

And after a moment of this it is clear that he comes Pause

Daisy doesn’t know what to do She looks at him he begins to
button up his trousers buckle his belt

She looks away into the woods not sure whether to be
embarrassed or not

Franklin finishes buttoning and tries to hand her his pocket
handkerchief She doesn’t notice at first her mind racing

He touches her knee which startles her she sees the offered
handkerchief and takes it

DAISY
I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m--

FRANKLIN
I’m the one who should
apologize

With his handkerchief she begins to wipe her dress and her
hands

FRANKLIN
Should we go back

Daisy nods as she wipes

DAISY VO
I knew even without him saying
anything that we were now -- not
just fifth cousins -- but very good

friends

He turns off the car radio and a telephone rings

INT DAISY’S HOUSE HALLWAY KITCHEN DAY

Daisy is on the telephone giggling like a schoolgirl
unconsciously playing her hair smiling transfixed by the phone
conversation

DAISY
(into the phone)
As soon as I can get away

She hangs up and as she fixes her hair she goes into the
kitchen

The moment she enters the kitchen she stops preening Here

Daisy in Franklin’s study pulls out a drawer of the desk
fumbles through some papers and takes out a small bottle of
aspirin

DAISY VO
By now everyone was used to me I

Franklin’s Mother with Tommy QUALTERS a copy of Scribners
magazine in her hand Around them staff are cleaning and
moving furniture flowers etc

MOTHER

QUALTERS

MOTHER

(reading from the

Magazine as she moves

toward the Hallway with

Daisy and Qualters)
If one could choose from all
possible British personalities the
two who might make the best impression
upon Americans -- King George and
Queen Elizabeth would not even make
the short list

(She looks up outraged)
How dare they talk about Royalty
like this

The Hallway is packed and buzzing with tides of servants and
tradesmen carrying flowers and various packages Everyone
seems busy and in a hurry

DAISY VO
No King of England had ever visited
America before But now he was
coming -- to Hyde Park on Hudson

We move off following Maid 2 who hurries towards the Kitchen
clutching a large vase taking us into the ‘backstage’ area
of the house which is also teeming with activity Maid 2
almost collides with Maid 1 who is rushing towards the Dining
Room We follow Maid 1 who nervously approaches Mother who
by now has reached the Dining Room

MAID 1
Mrs Roosevelt we appear not to have
enough plates

MOTHER

DAISY VO
Franklin warned us today stay out
of Mother’s way

MAID 1

miscounted

MOTHER

Mother’s English Butler now hurries in

BUTLER
Mrs Astor has called again

MOTHER

Mrs Astor Shell have plates Well

(Mother starts to head off

towards the Kitchen)
On second thought -- we’1ll ask her
cook Mrs Astor is so rich she
doesn’t know what she has

The Butler hesitates -- this is all too much for him -- then
he straightens his coat and we follow him as he heads off
into the Hallway where two black servants Nelson and
Thomas have entered from outside carrying their bags and
dressed in their travel clothes

The Butler stops and stares at them

THOMAS
(to the Butler)
Good morning

The Butler looks them up and down

NELSON
Could you tell us which way’s the
kitchen

The Butler ignores their question and heads off at speed
towards the Kitchen to protest their presence

We follow the Butler into the Kitchen where there is a
chaotic scene of preparation for that evening’s dinner
Dishes being prepared vegetables cut pots boiling with
cooks and cooks’ helpers working at double-speed

Mother is inspecting a vast and ornate dessert A female cook
stands next to her waiting for the verdict

MOTHER
Good Good But is ‘good’ the best
we can do They are royalty

Maid 1 is holding the kitchen telephone With her hand over
the receiver she calls to Mother

MAID 1
We can borrow the plates ma’am

MOTHER
Thank God for rich neighbors

Maid 2 appears out of breath

MOTHER
(to Maid 2)
What is it

MAID 2
Their rooms are ready ma’am

MOTHER
(she heads off to check on
their rooms) )
The poor dears are going to be
exhausted

Daisy stands at the sink she takes a water glass off of a
shelf and turns on the tap

COOK
(wiping the perspiration
from her brow to a
Scullery Maid)
‘Poor dears’

MAID 2
Exhausted my arse

BUTLER
Id watch what I said if I were
you

The Butler follows Mother out of the Kitchen
Maid 2 sticks her tongue out at the departed Butler

The Cook then clears her throat and gestures to Maid 2 that
Daisy is standing right there

Maid 2 then turns to Daisy and smiles Daisy filling the
glass at the sink ‘smiles’ back and then leaves via the back
door towards the Lawn

DAISY VO
The only quiet place left to work
was outside

EXT LAWN DAY
Daisy water glass and pill bottle in hand heads across the

lawn toward Franklin and Missy who sit together at a healthy

times to test it out

awful beating in DC

Laughter from the group as they get set to head off

pushed back Started something like
ten fist fights

MISSY
Poor Hick

ELEANOR
When she finally got back to her

‘God damn the King and Queen”

All laughing hard

light bulb on overhead as he continues to work on papers An
Aide stands with him

Missy is still reading the magazine

MISSY
(reads from article)
A large part of the country still
believes that Edward Duke of
Windsor is the rightful owner of
the British throne --

ELEANOR
“Thrones’ ‘Kings and Dukes’ It
all sounds like the Middle Ages

There is a knock on the door They women look at each other --
is it Mrs Roosevelt looking for them

FRANKLIN
(without looking up)
Is it my mother

MISSY
See who it is Daisy

Daisy goes and peeks through the crack

unobtrusively look through a bag on the car floor

to see what food has been packed for him

husband in the backseat Elizabeth is just finishing reading
the Scribners magazine article

odd cheese The bread has funny
little seeds I’m still picking
them out

He takes another bite of potato salad and then mouth full
and chewing he turns and looks out the window and smiles
with mouth closed as he waves to the crowds

The cheering and the bell tolling continues

BERTIE

DAISY
I thought the brother gave up being
king so he could marry the woman he
loved

Franklin looks up to take a peek at this conversation

ELEANOR
Daisy have you ever met a man who
would do that

Franklin goes back to his work

ELEANOR CONT’D
(continues to Missy)
Hick says she thinks the brother
might be positioning himself to be
the savior of the monarchy once
England has been defeated and the
fascists have taken over

FRANKLIN
He’s young Eleanor

This gets the women’s attention

(as he works)
So is she They’re both young

INT LIVING ROOM HALLWAY DINING ROOM EVENING
Mother stands ringing a little bell -- for dinner The
guests start to pair off All watch as the King goes right

up to Mother with his arm out

BERTIE
Mrs R-r-r-r-r-ro-ro

MOTHER
(taking his arm)
Id love to your majesty

And they lead the procession into the dining room where the
table is beautifully set for approximately twenty Servants
stand Mother is beaming Right behind is Franklin who moves
painfully on his braces and sticks Elizabeth is pretending
to hold onto his arm On his other arm is Qualters
unobtrusively letting Franklin hold on

FRANKLIN
(to Elizabeth a joke)
We could have sold tickets to this
dinner and made ourselves a pile
of money

She doesn’t know what to make of this he winks at her as
they continue toward the dining room

EXT FRONT OF HOUSE EVENING
Up in the sky is a gorgeous full moon

Even the chauffeurs outside are divided by class tonight in
one group the permanent employees of the wealthy and in
another five or six drivers hired for this night These
drivers talk and smoke among themselves under a tree by the
driveway The cars are parked along the drive

One of them notices the moon and taps another on the
shoulder The conversation stops as they look at the moon

FIRST DRIVER
(he’s Irish-American)
You think it’s full

SECOND DRIVER
I think it’s got another day

FIRST DRIVER
I think it’s full Let’s see what
Daisy thinks
For the first time we see Daisy sitting on the front steps of
the house Behind her the house is lit up From the open
porch a small military band is heard playing You For Me

She too is looking up at the moon

The FIRST DRIVER leaves the group and goes up to her

FIRST DRIVER
Daisy

She is startled having been lost in her thoughts

DAISY
Oh hello Dick

FIRST DRIVER
You think it’s full tonight

DAISY
What Oh -- yes That moon
certainly is full

FIRST DRIVER
(shouts back)
She says I’m right

DAISY
(suddenly worried)
Oh I didn’t know you-- I could be
wrong I don’t know for--

FIRST DRIVER
Do you need a ride home

DAISY
Me No No thank you I have my
car I just Such an important

night

She stands up notices the other drivers from this group
looking at her

FIRST DRIVER
Is it I don’t know What’s one
king more or less He still has to
put his pants on one leg at a time

2ND DRIVER
(calls)
Did you curtsey for the Queen
Daisy

DAISY
(calls back)
I certainly did Tommy And I think
I did it right
(smiles )
I didn’t fall down

They laugh The other group of official Chauffeurs ignore
them

THIRD DRIVER
How come you’re not inside there
Daisy

DAISY
Me Oh I don’t belong in there I’m
glad to see you working Frank

THIRD DRIVER
It’s just for the one night

DAISY
Well it’s something

A MAID comes from around the house with food for the drivers
The official chauffeurs ignore this

The others line up to eat Daisy watches this from a
distance

FIRST DRIVER
(to Maid joking)
Can I take some home for my dog

FOURTH DRIVER
He doesn’t have a dog

Laughter at their situation As Daisy wanders off into the
dark

MAID 2
(to one of the younger
chauffeurs )
Touch me there again you’ll be
wearing it and not eating it

Laughter

EXT FRONTSIDE OF HOUSE EVENING

We follow Daisy as she turns the corner of the house to the
porch where the military band is finishing playing a song
under strings of festive lights

A Maid with a tray of snacks has come out and waits

BAND LEADER
Fifteen minutes gentlemen

And the band members stand and circle the Maid with the tray
of food

INT DINING ROOM EVENING

Franklin sits next to the Queen he taps a spoon against his
glass to get the table’s attention

FRANKLIN
(whispers to the Queen)
Youll forgive me for not getting
up
(raises his glass to the
Table)
To His Majesty the King

Suddenly all the guests stand -- chairs pushed back Only
Franklin and the Royals remain seated The Guests all raise
glasses and repeat

GUESTS
To His Majesty the King

Everyone drinks
As the guests begin to sit Franklin has an afterthought

FRANKLIN
(toasts )
And to Her Majesty the Queen

The guests hesitate some stand again immediately some
hesitate and look among themselves -- what to do they all
finally stand

CAMERON
(to Eleanor next to him
as he stands)
Actually normally we wouldn’t
toast the Queen

And they drink Some repeating “To Her Majesty the Queen”
Some just saying to “The Queen” Some saying nothing or just
‘Welcome”

During this confusion the Queen taken aback by this
afterthought and what actually is being toasted drinks as
well

Her drinking to her own toast gets the attention of Mrs
Astor one of the guests She turns to her neighbor

MRS ASTOR
(under her breath)
She drank to herself

EXT LAWN EVENING

Daisy still stands at a short distance from the house
looking back The house is lit up and looking magnificent
romantic festive The band again is playing on the porch
She stands lost in her thoughts She smokes a cigarette

MISSYS VOICE
Shoot

Daisy turns there is Missy leaning over looking at her
shoes she has stepped in something

MISSY
(wiping her shoes)
Those damn horses And these are
my best shoes

Daisy approaches her looks down at her black and white
shoes

DAISY
It’s not the horses’ fault--

MISSY
(trying to clean her shoe)
I know I know You like them I’ve
been looking for you

DAISY
Do you need a handkerchief

MISSY
Come here

Daisy comes to Missy who puts her hand on Daisy’s shoulder to
keep her balance as she cleans the horse shit off her shoes

The band music continues from the porch

MISSY

We saw you out here--
DAISY

We
MISSY

Franklin’s asked me to tell you
that you could go home
(MORE )

MISSY (contd)
He thinks he’s going to be occupied
with the King all evening now

Daisy turns back toward the house try to hide her
disappointment

DAISY
Of course he is

INT HALLWAY DINING ROOM EVENING

The soup course is about to be served A waiter holds a
stopwatch at his side A Maid whispers

MAID 2
What are you doing with that

WAITER
(under his breath)
Weve been told the Queen is served
exactly 30 seconds after the King

The King is served his soup and the Waiter starts the
stopwatch ticking

Suddenly we hear an enormous crash

A serving tray with a pile of plates has collapsed startling
everyone

MOTHER
What happened

MAID 1
(holding the King’s soup)
I dont know No one touched it

BERTIE
I su-su-suppose an angel just passed -
a ve-ve-ry clumsy one

He smiles at his joke Franklin leads the laughter and gives
Bertie a big nodding smile The King is very pleased with
himself Mother is embarrassed but trying not to show it

Franklin looks to Eleanor who smiles and then nods her head
she has appreciated the King’s sense of humor and grace

ELEANOR
(to Cameron about the
King’s joke) )
That was very good

Maids 1 and 2 have quickly started to clean up

MAID 2
(to the other explaining
the crash)
It’s the full moon

The Maid 1 nods

MRS ASTOR
(to a neighbor)
I hope those werent mine
(to Cameron another
neighbor explaining)
She didnt have enough plates

EXT LAWN EVENING

Missy and Daisy sit on a bench under a tree the house aglow in
front of them and the music Both look at the moon Both smoke

DAISY
She doesn’t leave him alone She
doesn’t let him relax

MISSY
Is that what he tells you
DAISY
What
MISSY
Does he talk about her with you
Daisy
DAISY

With me Why would he talk about
his wife with me

MISSY
I don’t know how he stands it

Missy has finished her cigarette and tosses it on the ground
and stands

DAISY
Stands what

MISSY
Eleanors always off to places
Meetings How he must miss it

Daisy tosses her cigarette down and stands

DAISY
Miss what

Missy starts to head back to the house Daisy right behind
her

MISSY
Having a happy married life
together

DAISY
I don’t think that is the
President’s fault --

MISSY
I wasn’t saying-- I think it pains
him more than we can know -- not

having a wife to care for him

As they head toward the brightly lit house we hear only
their voices

DAISY VOICE
This morning she didn’t even know
about his sinuses

MISSY VOICE
Didn’t she

DAISY VOICE
She said she didn’t It’s sort of
like they’ve become just --
friends Just good friends

MISSY VOICE
She is a busy woman

DAISY VOICE
She’s his wife

INT DINING ROOM EVENING

the choice of tea or a highball

FRANKLIN
“My mother treats me in the exactly
same way Mr President But I
too prefer a cocktail Who

soaking it in

INT STUDY NIGHT

Bertie pushes Franklin in Franklin gestures that he should
close the door
FRANKLIN
Night cap Mothers gone to bed

Still sitting in his wheelchair he begins to make
drinks

I was worried for herif one
more thing went wrong

Smiles hands Bertie a drink

(about the drink) )
They worry about me My Mother and
Eleanor Both their fathers were
nasty drunks Cheers

BERTIE
Cheers

They drink Bertie is looking around the room

FRANKLIN
Do you collect stamps

BERTIE
I did I have I understand you are
a serious stamp collector Perhaps
you would show me some of your
stamps

FRANKLIN
You can’t be interested

BERTIE
But I am --

FRANKLIN
Don’t -- protest Thank you for the
thought though

Toasts him

When I was a young man -- before my
marriage of course -- I found that
showing one’s stamps was a very
helpful way to get a young woman’s
attention

BERTIE
Was it

FRANKLIN
They have to sit close to you
Share the magnifying glass

them

He ‘winks’ at Bertie And smiles

But I suppose if your father’s the
king Who needs stamps

Bertie sips his drink

The Queen is certainly a lovely
woman

Bertie looks up at him

BERTIE
As is the first lady

FRANKLIN

She’s a --

(choosing his words

carefully)
strong -- person

(smiles )
Some days you feel like you don’t
even want to get out of bed -- but

then these women they won’t let
you do that will they

He looks at Bertie who sips his drink and says

BERTIE
No

FRANKLIN
What do you do -- to be alone

Bertie looks confused

(explaining)
I have my stamps You need to
give them

(gestures to those outside

-- wherever )
a reason not to bother you You can
figure things out in the quiet of
your own head I open up my stamp
books and that tells everyone not
to bother me

Bertie nods

You were wonderful tonight young
man

Bertie is taken aback by this

BERTIE
What do you mean

FRANKLIN
Just what I said You were
graceful You were confident
Youre going to be a very fine
king Im sure of it

BERTIE
I dont know what to say

FRANKLIN
Your father would be very proud

BERTIE
(‘smiling’)
I’m not so certain about that

Franklin sips his drink looking right into Bertie’s eyes

FRANKLIN
If I were your father Id be
proud

They sip their drinks Bertie looks around thinking about
what to say

FRANKLIN CONT’D
I know -- some men have an entire
home as their castle I only get a
study
(then)
But then you must have many many
castles

He smiles Bertie looks at him

BERTIE
The Queen -- she’s She worries
so much It’s been hard for her

FRANKLIN
(a fact)
Women worry

BERTIE
I just stop listening to her
sometimes Forget I said that

FRANKLIN
Forgotten

Bertie takes a folded up piece of paper out of his inside

jacket pocket and looks at it

BERTIE
(explaining)
I’ve been asked to say things

He looks up and begins
BERTIE

Such a war as we now co-co-
contemplate -- The carnage look

at S-S-S-Spain Ch-children -- b-b-

bombed Tha-tha-that’s what we can
expect It will b-b-be horrific
Beyond anything m-m-man has seen

Bertie takes a sip then looks up at Franklin
BERTIE

(he tries again)
And yet we know some of your

countrymen wi-wi-wi-sh my country i-

i-i-i-ill And w-w-want us to
fail And want me to fail wi-th-th-
th you

(he looks away)
This god damn st-st-stutter

He looks back into his drink

FRANKLIN
What stutter

Bertie is surprised by this looks closely at Franklin

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
This god damn polio

They look closely at each other

BERTIE (CONTD)

Sometimes I think -- they des-
deserve better than me My --
‘subjects’ I’m sorry I don’t know
why-why I’m saying this to you I’m
s-s-supposed to be trying to
convince you to help us

FRANKLIN
Let me confess something now to
you

Bertie looks at him

then

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
As you have been so -- honest with
me No one -- ever mentions to me
that I can’t move my legs It’s
never referred to

Bertie is very intrigued by this

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
Not by anyone I used to think it
was because they were embarrassed
about it

Franklin starts to stand up out of his wheelchair Bertie
stands to help Franklin waves him off As he heads to his
desk moving slowly on his braces holding on to the backs of
chairs

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
But now I think it’s because that’s
not what they want to see

He sits at his desk takes a cigarette (his reason for coming
to the desk) offers one to Bertie as he talks

FRANKLIN (CONTD)

Of course we

(gestures he and Bertie)
think they

(gestures everyone out

there)
see everything that we are All our
flaws Or transgressions Or
failures But that is not what
they’re looking to find when they
look to us And God help us if that
ever changes

They look at each other

Think of the disappointment when
they find out what we really are
(smiles )

Sometimes it might make one feel an
imposter

He is lighting Bertie’s cigarette now so their faces are
close This last comment strikes home for Bertie

BERTIE
(unable to look up as he
speaks)
They didn’t want me as their King

FRANKLIN
I didn’t know they voted for that
in England

Bertie smiles Franklin relaxes behind his desk

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
Pretending at times to be someone
we know we aren’t Young man
that’s what I’ve learned it takes
to be a President And I’m going to
hazard a guess that it takes the
same damn thing to be a king

He smiles that big smile smoking his cigarette

FRANKLIN
I’m thinking -- another drink

INT LIVING ROOM HALLWAY NIGHT

The living room is empty laughter is heard coming from the
Study

Missy enters from the hallway on her way to the study
having obviously been called

She stops when she sees Bertie come out of the study
smiling to himself

He quietly closes the door behind him he appears to be a
somewhat changed man at least for the moment -- a new spring
in his step a satisfied smile

At first he doesn’t notice Missy

BERTIE
(after nearly bumping into
her)
Pardon me

MISSY
Sir
(corrects herself)
I mean Your Highness
(corrects herself again)
Your Majesty

She curtseys He smiles at her and she watches him head up
the steps two at a time

INT ELIZABETH’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Bertie goes through the bathroom and gently pushes the door
open to Elizabeths bedroom

Elizabeth asleep in bed Bertie stands for a moment then

Bertie goes and looks out the window and again there is the
full moon

BERTIE

smiling)
He said that the Indians -- they were
Eleanors ideas One of my-my-my

furious about it Franklins just
trying to keep it short

ELIZABETH

He talks about his wife like that to

BERTIE

(then)
I asked him -- without mentioning
you -- about these hot dogs

(MORE)

BERTIE (contd)
(she stares at him)
He said he doesnt get the fuss
Theyre just a good thing to eat at a
picnic Theres no meaning Nothing

ELIZABETH
You didnt say I was concerned

BERTIE
No

ELIZABETH
Im not sure I believe you--

BERTIE

ELIZABETH

Three different women tonight asked me

American queen If wed ever ‘allow

BERTIE
That was rude

ELIZABETH
Do you have a cigarette I have
smoked all of mine

BERTIE

He gives her a cigarette
Thank you A light
He lights her cigarette

ELIZABETH
I never wanted this life

BERTIE

ELIZABETH

He nods

She smokes

BERTIE
If theres a war -- and we know there
will be -- he believes America could

be persuaded to help

ELIZABETH
Did you see some of the people here
tonight Hear their names Theyre
from Germany Italy

BERTIE
Their ancestors--

ELIZABETH
Theyre Irish Theyre Jews They hate
us Bertie They want to see us fall
on our face They want to laugh at
us

She starts to cry

BERTIE
I think youre wrong I th-th- think
we just need to be a little more
confident

He gets up off the bed and heads back to his bedroom
Elizabeth is amazed stunned by this new attitude she has
never heard him talk like this before

BERTIE

Goodnight Im not sure I can even
sleep

(turns back to her)
Finally he patted me on the knee and
said young ma-ma-man its time for
you to go to bed Like a father I
suppose Hes very happy that I am
king

(Then one more thing)
When he retires hes going to write
detective stories I told him I love
detective stories

She just looked at him
He’s built a cottage He told me I

could come and stay anytime I
love detective stories

He closes the bathroom door behind him

INT PINK BEDROOM EXT FRONT OF HOUSE NIGHT

Bertie in his pajamas now sits in a chair in the corner and
smokes in the dark He gets up and goes to look at the War of
1812 anti-British prints on the wall which are lit only by
the moonlight one more time He strikes a match to take a
closer look

When noises outside distract him and he shakes out the match
He goes to the window pulls back the curtain and looks down
below

From his perspective we see an idling car -- having just
been brought from the garage A uniformed officer waits

Qualters and then Missy come out of the house

QUALTERS
(to Missy)
Do you want to drive

Without answering she goes around to the driver’s seat
Qualters is telling the officer something Bertie watches
this officer then hurry off Qualters gets in and drives
Missy off

Bertie watches the car go down the long drive he looks up at
the moon He is about to leave the window when a second car
is driven up by the Officer this car is Franklin’s

Suddenly the light in the room is turned on startling
Bertie

ELIZABETH
I thought you were asleep

BERTIE
(whispering)
Then why did you turn the light on

Outside a car is driving off Bertie looks out the window

ELIZABETH
Who’s that

BERTIE
It’s Franklin

Bertie goes to the wall switch and turns the light off

ELIZABETH
Can we call home I want to speak
with Lilibet

BERTIE
What Its--

Looks at the clock

ELIZABETH
Its morning there Shes up We know

They hear another car pull up outside They look at each
other then both go to the window pull back the curtains
and peek out

THREE WOMEN sit in an idling covertible as Eleanor hurries
from the house and gets into the back seat there is muffled
laughtergiggling from the women The King and Queen watch as
they drive off

ELIZABETH

INT DAISY’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Daisy in a white nightgown lies in her bed her bedsheets
twisted unable to sleep staring off toward the window and
the full moon She is restless tries to lie on a different
side then reaches and turns on a little bedside lamp and
picks up a book to read

DAISY VO
No one could sleep that night

She impetuously jumps out of bed grabs a sweater from a hook
on the back of her bedroom door and goes out quietly
closing the door behind her

We see for the first time on the back of the door visible
only when closed is a framed official portrait of President
Roosevelt -- the kind they hang in post offices

EXT DAISY’S HOUSE PORCH NIGHT

Daisy swings gently in the porch swing pushing with her bare
feet smoking staring out into the night The full moon
looking down upon her

Suddenly she gets up quickly stubbing out her cigarette in
the ashtray She rushes inside then quickly stops and grabs
the screen door to keep it from slamming shut and making
noise

EXT DAISY’S HOUSE INT DAISY’S CAR NIGHT

IN HER CAR dressed now she sits in the dark only the
reflection of the moon on the hood of the car she sighs a
big sigh and releases the brake and the car rolls a little
Only when it has rolled a comfortable distance from the house
does she turn on the engine and then the headlights And she
heads off the moon in front of her it’s as if she is being
pulled by the moon

EXT PINK BEDROOM NIGHT

Elizabeth sits on the bed waiting Bertie comes in from the
hallway in his robe

BERTIE
Theyre putting us through

Phone in the room rings Elizabeth answers it

ELIZABETH
(into phone)
Yes Yes put her on
(short pause then)

differences

Tell her -- its night Its dark

She rung off

INT DAISY’S CAR EXT THE ROAD NEAR TOP COTTAGE NIGHT

Daisy drives along the main road she pulls the car onto a
patch of grass on the side of the road and cuts the engine
She gets out and starts to head into the woods

EXT WOODS NIGHT

Daisy climbs lit only by the moon She seems to be in no
rush to get anywhere -- rather enjoying the night the
magical moonlight the mystery of the woods the cries of
owls the barking and howling of distant dogs

DAISY VO
If ever I missed him there was a
place he’d built for me to come
and be alone and miss him

EXT TOP COTTAGE NIGHT

She reaches the top her destination -- and there is Top
Cottage dark and bathed by the moon

EXTINT TOP COTTAGE NIGHT

Daisy sits on the porch where she has sat so often before
with Franklin and where she now sits looking off at the
distant hills She lights a cigarette and baths in the beauty
of the evening

Behind her the house is dark lit only as is everything
else by the moon

Suddenly through the glass door we see a shadowy naked
female figure scurry then stop seem to pick up something --
and for a instant we see her lit then the lighter is closed
and all we see is the glow of her cigarette Daisy stares
off utterly oblivious to all of this

All of a sudden a flashlight shines in Daisy’s face
startling her and making her jump up

MAN’S VOICE
What the hell are you doing here

Daisy trying to calm herself from the shock shades her eyes
and sees

DAISY
Tommy What the hell are you doing
here

QUALTERS
You shouldn’t be up here now

DAISY
Why Why not

Daisy still covers her eyes
DAISY
Can you get that out of my face

please

He lowers the flashlight and she sees lit now by the

flashlight a pair of shoes on the ground -- women’s black
and white shoes -- Missy’s
QUALTERS
You really shouldn’t be up here

through the bushes She slips and falls struggles and
hurries to get up and throws herself down the hill Anything

branches to steady herself until she pushes herself out of a

Missy takes a trick and smiles at her partner

DAISY VO
And of her ‘dark days And suicide
attempts

She takes another trick and the Girls are having a very good
time beating the Boys who show no expression -- they don’t
like losing

INT STUDY DAY 1942

Papers and files are being packed up by Aides and Missy who
is on her knees in the middle of the room sorting things

DAISY VO
When Missy fell terribly ill He
paid for everything

Daisy sits alone in a corner pretending to read a book but
every now and then looking at Missy

DAISY VO
He even changed his will -- giving
her half -- should she outlive him
But to the surprise of nearly
everyone -- he did not visit her
once in the hospital I asked him
why

Franklin wheels himself into the study in his chair and
heads for his desk His mind on other things Daisy just
watches him

DAISY VO
Its a terrible fault of mine he
said I find it too painful to be
around illness

INT LIVING ROOMSTUDY DAY 1942

Everything is being packed up phone lines rolled up
furniture returned to its proper places Daisy watches from
the doorway

She turns and heads through the room trying to stay out of
the way of the moving

As she reaches the study the door opens and Mother comes
out looking suspicious Daisy smiles politely at Mother and
goes in

FRANKLIN
(whispers )
Close the door Daisy

She closes the door And Franklin suddenly lifts a hat up off
his desk and there under it -- is a drink

Others in the room bring out the drinks they’d hidden from

Mother -- from a plant a bookcase under their jacket All
laugh -- a wonderful camaraderie
FRANKLIN

Someone pour Daisy a drink

Missy pours a glass and gives it to her The two share a look
-- a shared understanding And the others the men go back to
packing up the study Daisy looks around smiling -- she will
miss this

DAISY VO
I grew close not only to Missy but
to all of Franklin’s boys

(MORE)

DAISY VO (contd)
They seemed to accept me no
questions asked And no more
promised were made so none could be
broken

EXT ENTRYWAY OF HOUSE DRIVEWAY DAY 1942

The caravan of official cars are lined up for the exodus back
to Washington

Daisy stands at a distance and watches Franklin be carried to
his car

DAISY VO
Though he found he could now visit
home -- Hyde Park -- less and less

There were elections Then the war
Always so many things

A line of photographers patiently waits until he is in and
then -- he turns to them an Aide nods to the photographers
Franklin smiles and the flashbulbs pop like fourth of July

They continue to pop -- and the newsreel cameras buzz -- as
caravan heads off down the drive A few townspeople stand in
clusters and wave

Daisy slowly heads off across the field alone watching the
caravan snake its way down the long tree-lined driveway to
the road

DAISY VO
He always seemed confident that Id
be here waiting

She watches the cars

DAISY VO
And oh how I resented that

As the caravan reaches the road and turns Daisy suddenly
begins to runs toward it faster and faster and she starts
to wave as she runs

She continues to run and wave until the cars the caravan
and Franklin are out of sight And stops and stares off
toward where he has disappeared

CAPTIONS FDR eventually kept his promise and by 1942 Britain
and the United States were fighting shoulder to shoulder

When Daisy died in her hundredth year a box of letters and
diaries was found under her bed

Her special relationship with the President was finally no
longer just their secret
