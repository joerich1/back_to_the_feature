Cal goes to answer Jacob holds up a finger Cal stops
himself Once hes settled Jacob continues

JACOB
As I said Ive been watching you

without hesitation that you are
the sorriest man Ive ever seen in
my life -- dont interrupt Cal
its the truth and you need to
hear it Youre sitting there
with your Supercut haircut
getting drunk on watered down
vodka-cranberries like a fourteen-
year-old girl wearing a 41R
jacket when you should be wearing
a 40L -- I dont know if I want to
help you or euthanize you
-- stop drinking out of the
goddamn straw Cal

Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw

JACOB

You asked me for advice before
Cal so Im going to help you I
dont know why Maybe Im just

bored Maybe all my friends have
abandoned me for wives and
children and labradoodle puppies
who cares why Why doesnt
matter The point is youve got
a good face and a good head of
hair and Im bored as hell and
need a project So if you want
Im going to help you rediscover
your manhood Do you remember
when it was that you lost it

Cal shakes no

( )

18 18

JACOB
Doesnt matter well find it
And when we do when Im through
with you that wife of yours is
going to rue the day she decided
to give up on you too early
Thats my offer What do you say

Cal stares at him blankly A long beat of silence Cal
goes for a drink almost uses the straw then catches
himself He puts down the drink Looks up

CAL
Yeah okay

long driveway runs parallel to the yard A medium-sized
U-HAUL is parked in the driveway

Cal EXITS the back door carrying a BOX He loads it
into the U-haul and takes a last look back at

HIS BACKYARD

A weathered playground sits off to the side You can
tell it hasnt been used in quite some time Baseball
equipment lays all over the site of many father-son
catches An oft-used barbecue next to the house

You can tell a lot about this family from seeing this
backyard You like this family a lot from seeing this

She gathers herself Cal steps forward Instinct tells
him to comfort his wife but he cant anymore and he stops
himself She realizes this Theres something harsh and
complicated about the reality of it all

Tracy looks at the U-HAUL wipes her eyes and tries to
lighten things

CAL
The sprinklers turn off behind

TRACY

And I got really upset with an
umpire at Mollys t-ball game last

like the person I promised I
wouldnt turn into you know

CAL
If it rains a lot you need to
shut off the automatic setting

TRACY
And we havent been us not fora

KATE
Asshole as in someone who tells
a woman that hell call and never

Robbies grade on his oral book
REPORT --

KATE
Asshole as in someone who uses
“honesty to get a woman into bed
with him but is actually full of
shit like the rest of them

CAL
Because usually hes a very strong
public speaker --

KATE
Asshole as in someone who
allows a woman to go down on him

MANY ROWS BACK --
Sits Cal sandwiched between RANDOM SPECTATORS Cal is
now shaven and well-dressed but he looks miserable

His eyes brighten for a moment as he notices

AN EMPTY SEAT between Tracy and Hannah He leans
forward are they saving it for him But just then
Jacob arrives Kisses Hannah and takes Cals seat
Cal looks nauseous

ON STAGE

We WATCH the ceremony for a moment The PRINCIPAL labors
through her introduction

VOICE (VO)

first student speaker our very
own English teacher Kate Thompson

Cals former conquest steps onto stage

had the pleasure of teaching
Ladies and gentlemen Robbie
Weaver

Robbie takes the stage to APPLAUSE This is not the same
kid weve come to love Theres something different in
his face Hes been broken He spots JESSICA

ROBBIE
(a bit monotone)
Thank you Mrs Thompson
Welcome Class of 2011
(A BEAT)
I wasnt really sure what I wanted
to talk about today Mrs

Thompson said it might be good to
talk about growing up and getting
older and stuff So I guess Ill
talk about that

Cal watches concerned Wheres his son

ROBBIE
I grew up a lot this year I
think I used to think that
growing up meant really growing
Like getting taller and bigger
But now I think that growing up
just makes you smaller Your
dreams get smaller and what you
want gets smaller
(beat then)
I grew an inch and a half this
year but I feel a lot smaller

Cal sits forward getting increasingly concerned

ROBBIE
I was in love And I know that
makes parents laugh because Im
only thirteen but whatever I was

ROBBIE (CONTD)
I believed that there was one true
love for everyone and if you
fought for that person your one
true love would always work out
But thats not how it works It
sounded good when I was younger
but its just not how it works
Theres no such thing as one true
love for everyo--

CAL (0S)
Stop

Robbie turns Cal is STANDING in the middle of the
crowd Everyone turns to look at him

ROBBIE
Dad

CAL
Hi
(awkward to crowd)
Hi everyone

Silence No one knows what to do Cal is suddenly
really uncomfortable

CAL
May I have a word with my son
Itll just take a second

Cal tries to extricate himself from his row He steps
over people squeezes by people almost trips

Finally clear he gathers himself and tries to keep his
dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family

Robbie comes to the front of the stage bends down

ROBBIE
(HEATED WHISPER)
What are you doing

CAL
I dont know What are you doing

Robbies eyes well up with tears

ROBBIE

Cal turns toward the crowd announces

103 103
CAL

My sons graduation speech sucks

GASPS from the crowd

ON CAL

Now standing alone front and center in front of an
entire eighth grade graduation ceremony
He looks behind him at the panel of TEACHERS MRS
THOMPSON discreetly gives Cal the finger

CAL
In fairness I dont know where he
was going but I think we can all
agree it was heading in a pretty
depressing direction And I
basically wrote it for him I
mean I didnt literally write it
but I sure as hell influenced it
and the kids already a spitting
image of his mother and Ill be
damned if this is what hes going
to get from me

People squirm uncomfortable This is a train wreck

CAL
My son -- not him my actual son --
he believes in grand romantic
gestures He believes that people
have soulmates And we always
want to tell our thirteen-year-
olds that theyre wrong that ‘one
day youll understand young man
But maybe it should be the other
way around

He looks at Tracy out in the crowd

CAL
I met my soulmate when I was
fifteen years old Our first
date we went for ice cream
After my dad started teasing me
about my ‘first date’ the way dads
do And I told him ‘stop making
a big deal Dad Im going to go
on lots of dates with plenty of
girls That was the first time I
ever lied to my father
(THEN)
(MORE)

103 103
CAL (CONTD)
I met my soulmate when I was
fifteen years old And I have
loved her with everything I have
for every minute of every day
ever since she let me buy her that
first mint chip ice cream I have
loved her through the birth of our
three perfect children and I have
loved her even as Ive hated her --
only married couples can truly
understand that one And I dont
know what will wind up happening
with us -- I dont Robbie Im
sorry I cant give you that -- but
I promise you this I will never
stop trying When you find “the
one you never give up trying
and I love you my amazing boy
for reminding me of that

Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts Cal kisses
his son on the head then motions towards the microphone

Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces

ROBBIE
still love you Jessica Ive
loved you since the first time you
changed my sisters diaper Ive
loved you since

The crowd reacts (LAUGHS CHEERS etc) as Robbie
continues Cal stands back and smiles His boy is back
