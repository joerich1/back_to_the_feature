ALIENS DON’T SURF
FADE IN
THE WORLD - FROM SPACE

Orbiting lazily CAMERA MOVES IN Green-blue Full of
life Swirling weather patterns But the land masses are
unfamiliar It’s not our world Thank God

ANGLE - PLANET

An odd disturbance on the planet’s surface A pin point of
darkness Weather swirls and shifts around it The spot
grows like a cancer The verdant planet’s surface
blackens The more it covers the faster it grows An
exponential expansion It races over the curve of the
horizon Consuming a planet Whatever it is it leaves
no trace of life energy behind Just a dead desiccated
world But not ours Not yet

CAMERA MOVES past the dead planet into space To the
magnificent binary star supporting this solar system

THE STAR FLICKERS

Like a lightbulb sucking a weak current Something is
mysteriously draining the massive fusion reactions Jhe

A silvery shadow flashes PAST CAMERA Heading out to empty
space In the fading light it looks like A human
silhouette on a long flat board Surfing cCan’t get a
good look Too small Too fast A sweeping cut-back and
whatever it is it’s gone in a flash Flying through space
at an impossible speed --

Then An immense silhouette ominously obscures our view
MUSIC CUE GALACTUS’ THEME

FADE TO BLACK
CAMERA RUSHES THROUGH SPACE (MUSIC UP)
Past nebulae stars planets the diverse universe Past
an earth-built satellite heading in the other direction
The Pioneer spacecraft Familiar planets --
CAMERA loops around Jupiter at breakneck speed Ricochets
off the rings of Saturn We know where we are Ahead our
new destination Earth

A VAST ALIEN LANDSCAPE

A textured furrowed surface Pink white The feeling
that it’s strangely alive A gleaming silver blade filis
the screen and cleaves the landscape It’s a fingernail
being clipped --

INT OFFICE - DAY

RAY RAMSEY is the man clipping it He’s bored Behind a
desk his cluttered office in chaos Mismatched file
cabinets dog-eared reference books The frosted glass
reads backwards SETI Search for Extra-Terrestrial
Intelligence Research Division United States Department
of Defense

RAY
What makes you think these were
aliens

Ray looks at the wall clock The second hand sweeps toward
three-thirty in slow-motion MR and MRS QUINCY sit
across from hin

MRS QUINCY
They examined us

Ray stands up and walks around his desk as he continues to
talk --

RAY
Well Mrs Quincy when we
examined you we found no
physical evidence of any kind

Ray adjusts a telescope pointed out the window --

MR QUINCY
They knew you would That’s
whey they didn’t leave a trace
Their science is much more
advanced
(whispers)
They don’t want us to know

Ray squints through the telescope
RAY’S POV - THROUGH THE TELESCOPE

A building a block away An art school Ray pans past
students in a life drawing studio class until he gets to -
the model A beautiful woman her back to CAMERA partially
hidden by a support column her face obscured by a tangle
of hair She brushes her hair She’s beautiful Totally
unself-conscious --
ON RAY
Breathless He steps away a bit startled

MRS QUINCY
It was awful

MR QUINCY
They examined us sampled our
bodily fluids

Ray turns back to the Quincys Pauses a moment as if
remembering why they’re in his office

RAY
Who did

MR QUINCY
The aliens

It should be clear by now Mrand Mrs Quincy are nuts
And Ray has heard it all before

MRS QUINCY
Do you want to hear about the
examination

Ray takes another look through the telescope then sighs
and turns back to the Quincys --

RAY
Did you get a description
MRS QUINCY
We were totally nude
RAY
Of then
MR QUINCY
(rehearsed)

They were unlike anything our human
eyes had ever beheld Completely
alien in appearance yet somehow
strangely beautiful

Ray smacks the telescope in frustration He reaches into
an overstuffed drawer and takes out a dog-eared stack of
photos He shows the first Mrs Quincy’s face lights
with recognition --

RAY
Something like this

MRS QUINCY
Yes Not as vicious
THE DRAWING - it’s the creature from the movie “‘Alien’’

RAY
A nice alien Like this

The next picture is ET --

Ray puts the

MR QUINCY
Yeah That’s it There were a
bunch of them I11 never forget
it as long as I live These are
secret government photos aren’t
they

pictures down and nods seriously

RAY
No They’re Hollywood movie
photos You apparently saw an
““ET’ from the 1982 Steven
Spielberg film Good flick

MRS QUINCY
(off-balance)
These were uh green

RAY
We get a lot of those About
three feet tall

MR QUINCY
You think we’re making this up

RAY
Mr Quincy it doesn’t matter what IT
think I’ve taken thousands of
these reports of UFOs and extra-
terrestrial encounters But I’ve
yet to find a single piece of hard
evidence a photograph in focus a
chemical compound not found on
earth But it never happens Do
you know why Because they aren’t
real We’d like them to be but
they’re not We’re all alone
There’s no such thing as aliens

Ray takes the report to the overstuffed file cabinet and

tosses it in without looking

RAY
But I have your report You’ve
done your civic duty Have a
nice day

Ray shows them to the door

It will never be seen again

MR QUINCY
You don’t have any faith

RAY
Faith is nice I need proof
Photos An anti-gravity device
would be swell Maybe the
disintegrating ray from that
Daffy Duck cartoon

Ray waves bye-bye as he stands in the middle of the
reception area surrounded by more crackpots with more
stories

RAY
Dottie how much longer until
my government pension

DOTTIE speaks without removing the cigarette typing the
whole time

DOTTIE
Nineteen years five months
six days
(checks the clock)
And two hours

The sound of the fax machine gets Ray’s attention There’s
a linguini of paper lying on the floor and more printing

RAY
I thought we were going to
change that number

DOTTIE
We did

RAY
He got the new one Already

Ray fumbles with the huge pile of paper tears it from the
machine

RAY
Who is this guy

ON THE FAXES

Comparative astronomical star charts 3-D technical
representations Very impressive Except for the last
bold-font page fe it
COMING EARTH IS DOMED

RAY
I assume he means “doomed’’

tosses the pile of fax paper in the trash He looks up

She lowers her sleep mask Calvin sighs opens his window

He climbs down off his seat and squeezes carefully past
this mother Calvin walks down the aisle toward the
cockpit He stops a STEWARDESS

CALVIN
I have to speak to the pilot
It’s urgent

STEWARDESS
Why don’t you tell me and I’1l
tell him okay

Tables are rocked A sculpted bust (briefly seen it’s Ben
Grimm) falls and shatters The Surfer’s unconscious body
lies still amid broken glass and wood

A dog startles awake from its bed and leaps up barking
WATCHER wears a seeing-eye harness

ALICIA (0S)
What is it

ALICIA MASTERS turns from where she works on a sculpture
Her unseeing eyes stare into the darkness as she listens
It’s the woman we saw modelling at the art school She’s
beautiful and blind

She moves forward glass crunches --

ALICIA
Watcher what happened

Watcher whimpers noses around the motionless body of the
Surfer --

Alicia stumbles over a displaced piece of furniture Her
hand catches on a piece of broken glass and she cuts
herself --

ALICIA
Oh

As she steadies herself to stand up her other hand brushes
something --

THE SURFER Lying inches from her --
Alicia recoils when her fingers brush his body

ALICIA
Who is that Who’s there

No answer Slowly her fingers return to the body
Playing over him efficiently and gently like a piano
virtuoso exploring taking inventory - “‘Seeing’’

An oddly sensual moment as Alicia “looks around’’ Her
hands move to his face the smooth features

THE SURFER’s eyes open
P0V - SURFER’S VISION

Alicias face bending down to his But not just the wild
colors and wavelengths Something’s changed With the
Surfer’s massive expenditure of energy Alicia’s features
are visible in the spectrum light we’re familiar with
Light and dark and fleshtones overlaid with the energy
traces and corresponding colors The image is humanized

ALICIA
Are you alive

The Surfer turns to the dog Watcher panting away in
fuschia and chartreuse A visible mist billowing from his
mouth

BACK TO SCENE

The Surfer doesn’t answer doesn’t move But he watches
this strange new creature minister to him --

She stands goes to the sink fills a basin and brings a
washcloth --

Alicia puts the washcloth on the Surfer’s forehead He
sits up with a start Alicia jumps back

The Surfer relaxes takes the washcloth Looks at it
Smells it Let’s Alicia return it to his forehead --

ALICIA
What happened Are you
alright Here can you

Alicia helps the Surfer to the couch He’s heavy but
weakly helps her --

ALICIA
I’m sorry

Alicia turns on the lights

ALICIA
Since I don’t need them I
forget Better

Alicia waits for an answer There is none

ALICIA
Like I said I’m blind So
you’re going to have to do more
than nod or shake your head
okay

No response
ALICIA

What if you’re deaf Then
we’re in real trouble

She touches his forehead and there is a faint glow of
cos nic energy at her touch

ALTCIA
You‘re hurt aren’t you no
weak

She stops as if listening An answer --

blood rom where she cut herself

The Su fer touches the cut watches her wince with pain

ALICIA
Here you go

The Surfer raises his hand over the food The air
shimmers a cosmic ow and --

The food dissolves The molecules convert into pure energy
that flows back into the Surfer (Just like the core
sample he took at in the clearing)

The process gives off heat Alicia shields herself
Watcher barks

ALICIA
What did you just do

The Surfer turns and looks at her She feels for the tray
ef food It’s gone --

ALICIA (CONT’D)
What happened to the food the
tray Who what are you

In front of the Surfer on a table is a bowl of fruit

The Surfer raises his hands to it and converts it to energy
too

Watcher stands close by BARKING The Surfer reaches a
hand out toward the dog In position to convert him to
energy

Alicia pulls the dog away --

ALICIA
No Watcher Be nice

She hugs and pets the dog The Surfer watches She
reaches out takes the Surfer’s hand and places it on the
dog --

ALICIA

The Surfer follows Alicia’s movement Gets nothing from
the experience emotionally but understands Watcher pants
happily --

Before she can get there the door explodes off its hinges
SOLDIERS double-time inside Some in radiation suits
others conventional armed

Like storm-troopers they fan out around Alicia knocking
her over not realizing she’s blind --

SOLDIER
Fan out

Watcher runs out barking furiously A soldier reacts by
leveling a gun at the dog --

MAJ POWELL
Whoa son just a dog

Maj Powell helps Alicia off the ground
MAJ POWELL
I’m sorry Ma’am but we have a
situation here
Powell looks up notices the broken glass and damage -

MAJ POWELL
What caused that Where is it

e TECHS takes readings with
radiation monitors homing in on the table where the food
was

We’re within safe levels but

Powell turns back to Alicia as SOLDIERS loudly turn the
place upside down --

ALICIA
Hey What are you doing
Stop it You can’t do this

MAJ POWELL

Why would you try to hide it

Alicia feels the decorations on Powell’s uniform

ALICIA

Alicia smiles She knew that Powell turns to his men --

ALICIA
I’m not hiding anything I
don’t know anything But this

hurt You seem to want to hurt
him some more

MAJ POWELL
We’re concerned for public
safety

ALICIA
He seemed harmless confused

MAJ POWELL
We have what’s left of two

harmless

Yeah technically But that’s

public relations position

MAJ POWELL
We had an incident last night
A ‘contact’

Ray looks supremely skeptical --

RAY
With what

Powell takes a breath and turns around --

MAJ POWELL
Our air defense system tracked
a foreign object entering
earth’s atmosphere over North
America at an extremely high
rate of speed

RAY
An asteroid

MAJ POWELL
The object was observed making
several abrupt shifts in direction
RAY

Possibly a satellite in orbital

decay

MAJ POWELL

When the object failed to
respond to hailing frequencies
five of our most sophisticated
jets were engaged They were
easily out-maneuvered three
were downed by this object

Ray leans forward with interest --

MAJ POWELL

Our radars detected sub-orbital
speeds in excess of mach 20

The ramifications hit

Ray

RAY

What kind of object

We think

What did

Powell sets his jaw

MAJ POWELL
it was an alien

RAY
the craft look like

He can’t believe these words are

coming out of his mouth --

MAJ POWELL

There was no craft It looked
to my men like a silver man
standing on a flying surfboard

Powell watches Ray carefully for a reaction Ray lets
an uncontrolled laugh --

MAJ POWELL

We don’t think it’s funny

No I I’ve seen you I

work in the Federal building

You don’t mind them looking at
you

Did it bother you If you
haven‘t noticed I’m blind
The idea of people seeing
things doesn’t offend me

to think is an alien

tell me about it

really look like bodies

RAY
Okay fine I’1l play along
Can you tell me anything else

Surfer looks back to Alicia --

ALICIA
Go with them Please

Alicia’s eyes well up A tear rolls down her cheek -

The surfer notices this He touches it inspects it He
seems puzzled He touches his own face and finds nothing

ALICIA
Go with then

SURFER

The Surfer shoulders his board and steps forward The
solciers ready the shackles -

The Surfer approaches Powell Powell grips his gun
tigrtly

The Surfer looks at the gun He’s seen guns before

ALICIA
Put the gun away He knows what it
is It’s threatening
(then )
Do you want him to come with
you or not

Powell relents The Surfer submits to the restraints

ALICIA
You better not hurt him you

I’m retired remember

MAJ POWELL
I’m still recommending you for
a commendation

Who cares Ray is glances back at Alicia whose eyes seem
to be following the Surfer though that’s impossible

transport helicopter ---

Ray goes to her

RAY
Are you alright

Alicia reaches out touches him gently to fix the distance
Then slugs him hard Ray falls

ALICIA
You’re a jerk Why did you
call them He just wants to
understand

RAY
I didn’t know I called before
we talked to hin

ALICIA
- Exactly

RAY
But you told him to go along

ALICIA
Because if I didn’t those
soldiers would have been hurt
Or worse They’re just kids
doing a job I did it to save
t

RAY

You did the right thing This
is serious stuff Alicia The
government should handle it

ALICIA
And what about this Galactus

RAY
What about it We don’t even
know what it is

ALICIA
Don’t you think we should find
out

RAY

I’m sure they’ll
ALICIA
They’1l what Sit down and talk to

As TECHNICIANS and SCIENTISTS use heavily-reinforced cables
to strap him into a high-tech examining table He submits

INT LABORATORY

Armed SOLDIERS stand by as the room is cleared It’s an
insulated and armored radiation chamber

The Surfer is alone surrounded by ominous-looking high-
tech equipment

THE OBSERVATION ROOM

Scientists and Technicians join support personnel and Maj
Powell who chews on an unlit stogie

Equipment HUMS and WHIRRS and a nuclear-powered laser drops
into place facing the Surfer

THE SURFER looks on curiously

THE LASER powers up and a crimson beam makes contact with
the Surfer’s arm He looks down curiously but without
reaction

ANOTHER LAB ROOM

The Surfer’s board rests on a table as a team of SCIENTISTS
and ENGINEERS attempt an analysis --

RAY

Yes Ray Ramsey SETI research
I’m calling to check on the
alien

(beat)
What do you mean that’s
Classified I’m a level 7
something Well how do I
find a secure line Hello

Ray hangs up turns to Alicia --

RAY
They’ve locked down security
Look the Surfer will be okay
He’s a revolutionary discovery
They’11 probably trot him out
at a press conference he’ll
be on Nightline
ALICIA
Really

Ray turns on a small TV and scans the channels Nothing
No news

RAY
Theyll take care of him They
have to

Alicia throws her coffee mug across the room It breaks

RAY
Well you’ve had enough coffee

ALICIA
Dammnit Ray This is all
wrong He was trying to tell
us something

RAY
Look this has been emotional
for all of us Yes we
encountered an actual alien
being for God’s sake But it’s
not like it’s the end of the
world

ALICIA
You’re sure about that What
if it is ay Would we even
know it

RAY
It’s one alien he’s rides a
surfboard for crying out loud

ALICIA
What if it’s a sign Or a test
We have no idea I’ve got a bad
feeling about this Galactus

RAY
What is that women’s intuition

ALICIA
It’s human intuition Get some

RAY

You know I deal with people
like you every day People
come into this office “I saw
a UFO They abducted me’’
You’re sounding like this one
guy this loony tune who’s been
faxing in ‘end of the world’

messages

Tis gets Alicia’s attention --

ALICIA
What kind of messages

Fay digs in the trash can and comes up with the latest pile
cf doomsday faxes

RAY
Star charts technical
graphs then this stuff
““The world is domed’’ We
think he means doomed “Beware
the cosmic rays’’

RAY
It looks abandoned Well we
know there’s a phone line from
the fax trace

Ray steps back kicks into a row of converted garbage cans
(Home-made high-energy Dobsonian Cherenkov radiation
detectors) He yells out --

RAY
Hey Anybody home

A scraggly-haired head pops out of an upper window --

You’re lost Place has been
closed for years Go home
RAY
We want to ask you a few
questions

Ray This is Alicia Wait
your name’s familiar

MILO

I used to publish in the
journals So did you Dr
Ramsey Boring conventional
catalog-related topics but
usually well-reasoned I guess
we both moved on to bigger and
better things

(then )
I take care of this place since
lack of funding shut it down No

free to explore

and Milo opens a fridge Ray and Alicia decline Milo pops
one He’s nervous keeps sneaking glances at Alicia but
never for too long

MILO
Good stuff You know a great
idea Double jolt cola Like
double espresso Twice the
sugar and twice the caffeine

RAY
Why not just drink two

MILO
Urination is a problem I’m
thinking about modifying one of
those fisherman’s pals They
hold about a pint but if I
could attach

RAY
(interrupting)
Got it
© Milo winks at Ray like they understand each other
ALICIA

We wanted to ask about those
‘ faxes you sent
MILO
I would’ve preferred you E-
mailed me I don’t do face 2
face anymore

RAY
Well we’re here

Milo ponders this sneaks a side-long glance at Alicia
leans in toward Ray

MILO
She’s very pretty

As if figuring Ray’s interest --

ALICIA
She’s blind not deaf

Milo laughs nervously

“ MILO
I’m sorry See I’m really no
good around people So you
read my reports

RAY
Pretend I didn’t

MILO
Okay I’11 cut through the
cybercrud and keep it simple

Milo rummages pulls out charts He’s passionate about
this stuff and more than a little manic --

MILO
Visual aids

Milo holds up a ‘before’ and ‘after’ star chart Before
A red marker circles a point of light After A red
marker circles the same place but it’s dark

MILO
You see this Tau Ceti in the
Magellan cluster One day it’s
there the next gone I
noticed this eighteen months
ago That got me started

Milo holds up another --

MILO
This is or was M31 an entire
solar system revolving around a
binary star All trace of it
gone in twenty four hours

MILO

(continuing)
Here’s a list of stars and
celestial objects that have
been ““lost’’ in the last year
alone Completely vanished from
the night sky Now when I say
the last year these distant
planets and stars could have
been destroyed a hundred years
ago but if the light from the
phenomenon hasn’t reached us
yet we have no way to see it
Follow me

RAY
Then it could be hundreds of
years before this would ever
have anything to do with earth

MILO
Ha You’d think that wouldn’t
you I did too at first But
that’s wrong

Milo spins to his computer and his hands dance over the
keyboard Despite his appearance he’s quite graceful in
his element --

MILO
I grepped the data for a
pattern

Milo swivels the computer screen to face CAMERA and Ray -
ON THE COMPUTER

Destroyed stars and planets graphically “imploded’’ in
sequence leaving a distinctive icon in their place The
remaining background stars are erased as the entire model
is three-dimensionally rotated into an “overhead’’ view --

In the corner of the screen is the milky way --

MILO
Were here

Next a dotted line traces the path of destruction in our
general direction --

MILO
The distance between these two
former stars is a couple of
light years But the time I
observed between their
extinctions was less than a
’ month Impossible right
Milo’s up to

RAY
It would have to be able to
move faster than the speed of
light

evangelist fervor --

MILO
Yes Whatever we’re talking
about here let’s call it
ALICIA
(interrupting)
Galactus
MILO

Um okay Sure Why not
This ““Galactus’’ is able to
navigate through space and
time at speeds greater than
the speed of light

RAY
But that’s impossible

Milo stares in awe at his computer model --

MILO

Sure Every scientist on earth
knows it is

(taps the computer screen)
But apparently He doesn’t
Maybe He bends time makes use
of black holes or wormholes I
don’t know how but He does it

Milo pauses to let that sink in then continues --

MILO
So even though the light from the
systems that have been destroyed
might not reach us for years this
Galactus - as you call it - could
reach us a lot sooner Because He
ais heading this way

RAY
You say “he’’

MILO
He she whatever I don’t think
God’s gender is really an issue

RAY
God

re

Ray stands

MILO
Well A god Maybe not the God
or your god I’m not a religious
man maybe you are But what else
do you call something with this
kind of power Mankind always
assumes just and benevolent Gods
Well what if one day He shows up
and he’s neither What if he
just doesn’t give a shit

RAY
This is absurd
(sotto to Alicia)
He’s nuts

MILO
Of course it’s absurd You’re

‘being forced to confront the

arbitrariness of human existence
how can it not be

RAY
We’re talking about one little
alien visitor

MILO
What alien

Milo looks back and forth between Ray and Alicia

RAY
It’s classified

ALICIA
(interrupting)
Two days ago the Army had a
run-in with what a visitor

Milo is wide-eyed Ray looks irritated Alicia doesn’t

care

MILO
Jiminy Crickets The timing
works What did it look like

RAY
(under his breath)
A Silver Surfer A guy ona
surfboard Little taller than
me Good-looking

MILO

Wow It’s never what you
expect is it

(putting it together)
And you think these two
obviously intelligent
extraterrestrial phenomenon
are somehow related

Ray doesn’t

MILO
I would love to see this Silver
Surfer

ALICIA

Ray can arrange it Let’s go

RAY
What -

Milo gets suddenly reserved --

MILO
Thanks no I can’t

ALICIA
Why what’s wrong

MILO
I don’t get out much I’m not
a people person You go

RAY
Agoraphobic

MILO
So I bet you’ve got issues

RAY
Come on Alicia

ALICIA
We need him Ray He can explain
this thing We have to find the
Maj Powell and try to talk to the
Surfer If we can understand hin
maybe we can figure this out
stop whatever it is before it’s
too late

RAY
And save the world

Alicia shrugs

ALICIA
Why not Someone’s got to

Ray smacks his forehead

MILO
Feeling kind of small and
insignificant huh Ray

ALICIA
Something’s going on Ray
We’re in the middle of it
Destiny picked us Get your
coat Milo

Milo edges closer to his computer --

MILO
I really can’t

ALICIA
You want to meet the alien

MILO
Of course but People and
places make me nervous

ALICIA
The end of the world makes me
nervous Milo we need you

Ray shakes his head disbelievingly Alicia takes Milo by
the shoulders --

problems of three little people
don’t amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world He needs

As it gets in front of the apartment complex a gun barrel
is thrust out the window --

The buyer scrambles back into the complex --

The Surfer turns at the sound of fear in the voices --

The gun opens fire spraying bullets down the street after
the fleeing gang-bangers --

Kicking up dirt chipping stucco --

Missing the gang-bangers --

But not the kids playing A small black child is knocked off
his big wheel by a bullet --

Another bullet hits the Surfer in the leg where he stands up
the street but it’s only an annoyance --

Tires SQUEAL and the car guns it out of there --

examining a scrape on his arm Another kid a girl stands
there holding her doll and CRYING loudly --

grass --

to the kid with the scrape --

The Surfer watches the scene --

The woman is in a state of shock Another woman from the
apartment joins her on the street --

As the woman holds her dying child and wails the stranger
in the overcoat is suddenly standing beside her --

She looks up her eyes pleading --

MOM
They shot my baby Why’d they
shoot my baby

She responds to the Surfer as if he’s a figure of
authority a cop a doctor Ignoring the silver alien
face She’s desperate --

MOM
Save him save my baby

But she knows it’s hopeless She holds the child tightly

to her chest trying to protect him from a world that’s
already taken him --

(quietly)
Please

The Surfer bends down and gently unwraps the woman’s
protective grasp --

He inspects the fatal wound --
And lays his hand over it --

The soft glow of the Surfers power cosmic bathes the child
and the skin around the wound knits and heals to his touch

The mother watches in silence afraid to interrupt the
moment --

The Surfer stands up as the child weakly opens his eyes and
sees his mother --

CHILD
Mama what happened

With every passing second the child gains strength It’s
almost too much for the poor woman Tears stream down her
face as she hugs her child --
MOM

A miracle sweetie just a

miracle
She looks up at the Surfer but says nothing --
THE SURFER reaches down and touches the tears on her face

The Surfer rounds a corner as The neighborhood gathers
around the mother and her child

Then the Rolex and the pinkie ring

THE SURFER AND ALICIA

As she gets closer the Surfer’s board lowers to the
ground

SURFER

There is much do not

His voice is lyrical musical almost every word chosen
carefully like a poem --

Milo takes out a microcassette recorder out of his bag an
keys it holding it out to capture the words --

The Surfer is now articulate dignified

ALICIA
We are sorry for the men who
attacked you

SURFER
You did not want them harmed understand did
not hurt them I will not hurt anymore

RAY
Well they want to hurt you

SURFER
It will not matter
(lowers his head)

lam sorry for what have caused

For what he will cause The Surfer lowers his head He’s
struggling with something new Emotion

RAY
Which is what What have you
caused

SURFER

without number but have never saan one such as
your earth This planet could be 9 paradise

The Surfer pauses searching for the right words --

SURFER
But there is co much suffering hatred crualty
salfichness

The Surfer seems pained by his own words He does not
share our semiotic remove Words as symbols divorced from
action For him words are real they are feelings and
actions --

ALICIA
Not everyone is like that
There is also good in the
world Trust compassion
generosity love

The Surfer turns away he can not meet her gaze --

SURFER
Yes hava saan that too But f it ic within your
power to choosa why do so many choose wtong”

The Surfer opens his mouth to speak then stops Alicia
understands --

ALICIA
Explain the color blue to me
Ray Describe a sunset to
someone who can’t see

RAY
Can it be stopped

SURFER
Galactus cannot be stopped He must feed

MILO
Feed So we’re going to be

cosmic luncheonette

Ray turns to the Surfer pleading --

SURFER
Not you Your world

RAY
But we’ll die too

Sorry You invited him
You’re not sorry You probably

The Surfer sets his jaw against the truth
nothing

RAY

in it but here you are And
now you tell us we’re going to
be destroyed Now We’re ona

He says

SURFER
Do not look for meaning where there is none

exte 5s his hand --

A tcugh question She touches the tear holds the silver
drorlet on her finger and struggles for an answer

ALICIA
It’s an emotion Happiness
sadness loss memory It’s
very human

Wavers As if some brainwashed sense of duty were breaking
down There is a deep and real pain here --

The Surfer struggles with it and finally meets Alicia’s
gaze --

The Surfer turns to Ray --

A pause as the Surfer remembers his unspoken tragedy --

BOOM AN EXPLOSION ROCKS THE SURFER WHERE HE STANDS -

Then another And another BOOM BOOM BOOM The
accumulative affect keeping the Surfer off-balance
Preventing him from recovering --

Ray Alicia and Milo are thrown to the ground --

They shield themselves from the heat and concussion and
look up But it’s not Galactus --

it’s the army These first explosions are mortar shells

ALICIA
What No

Before she can move a trio of soldiers grab her under
battlefield conditions and carry her off --

Ray and Milo too --

MILO
Hey

Alicia Ray and Milo are hustled to a safe distance and the
attack escalates --

ANGLE - MAJ POWELL
In command leading the assault
MAJ POWELL

We’re ready for this alien
freak this time

ALICIA
No

RAY
You don’t understand

On Powell’s command rocket launchers drown them out
Phosphor trails converge from a semi-circular perimeter
whistling in --

THE SURFER struggles to his feet Gestures to his board --
THE BOARD like a living thing moves toward him --

zz-BOOM zz-BOOM zz-BOOM The Surfer is staggered
again Driven back Separated from his board --

A trio of HELICOPTERS whip low across the tree line When
they hit the clearing they begin firing rockets --

ce ——
Chip-shotting it across the landscape --

THE SURFER grasps for his board as it’s blasted farther and
farther away from him --

MAJ POWELL
Keep him away from that board

That’s the plan --

Ground troops march from the brush from all directions
converging on the Surfer --

They open fire with automatic rifles all the while
advancing driving him back away from his board --

While another division secures the board --
The air is smoky with discharge --

The Surfer is hit with hundreds upon hundreds of rounds
An impossible number of shells Like a pincushion each
round makes a silvery impact and a spreading ripple --

The ripples overlap in visual echoes across his body and
the cumulative effect becomes too much for his energy-
absorbing abilities to assimilate --

POV - SURFER’S VISION

The assembled military through his eyes Through the
painful loss of energy the scene becomes increasingly
familiar te us The colors of the Surfer’s energy-sensing
perception dim and his cosmic power fades with the
onslaught --

BACK TO SCENE

While the Surfer is distracted the army throws an
Adamantium mesh net over the downed board Chains are
wrapped over this and winches pull the assemblage tight
Soldiers anchor the chains to anything handy jeeps tanks
trees --

ON ALICIA RAY AND MILO

They can’t believe their senses Alicia holds her ears
against the din and screams soundlessly --

ALICIA
(inaudible)
NOOOO

Ray’s mouth moves without words shouting at the soldiers
nearby but no one can hear --

A break in the fire A relative silence --
° RAY
(to Alicia)
He’s not fighting back

ALICIA
He won’t anymore

THE SURFER
He rises barely So weak So fragile --

A final barrage hits him His silver skin is no longer so
shiny There is a dull ashen lifeless cast to it now and

THE SURFER’S BODY

He lies in the grass smoking tendrils curling up into the
sky --

THE SOLDIERS
Disbelieving they break out into applause --
POWELL allows himself a satisfied smile --
Ray turns to Powell and through clenched teeth --
RAY
Excuse me Sgt Bilko but
instead of trying to ill
everything that moves why

don’t you try listening for a
change
94

Powell’s head whips around viciously to ream Ray for
pissing on his moment of glory but before a word can be
spoken --

THE MOTHER OF ALL INTERRUPTIONS A shadow blots out the
sun --

What happens next is mind-boggling --

It’s like something between a spaceship and a living

‘planet The size of a small city And it’s sinking out of
the now-darkened sky like an angry eclipse --

GALACTUS’ °SHIP’’

The complexity of design suggests something much larger
than its considerable size It is planet-shaped But a
planet as computer architecture Specifically designed and
detailed down to the atomic level This detail appears
visible one moment and is gone the next

(See the work of Moebius and Geoff Darrow for
a jumping-off point in design)

Let’s say it now congratulations to our special effects
crew

THE SCENE IS IN A PURGATORY-LIKE TWILIGHT
A panic races through the ranks of the soldiers

MAJ POWELL
What in heaven’s name is that

MILO
(proudly knowing an answer)
Galactus
Ray holds Alicia --
RAY

The Surfer’s down
Alicia knows it Tears stream down her face
GALACTUS’ SHIP

Hovers there Then A thread-thin light of pitch-darkness
from the underbelly of the mammoth craft --

Vaguely violet in aspect the dark side of the Surfer’s
power cosmic --

The fine beam impacts with the top of the highest peak
There is no immediate effect The radiant beam just
shines a point of darkness like Satan’s flashlight The
point of impact is some distance away --

BACK TO SCENE

Ray turns to Maj Powell --

RAY
The Surfer was our only hope
against it

MAJ POWELL

What is that

RAY
If this is a good news-bad news
joke that’s the bad news

ALICIA
We didn’t even try to
understand

MAJ POWELL
We’ll take of it the same way

RAY
The sucker bet of a lifetime
and I can’t reach my bookie

Powell turns to his troops --

MAJ POWELL
I want that thing brought down
now

Even at face value it looks like a ridiculous attempt But
just watch --

AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT --

ROCKET LAUNCHERS are wheeled around and elevated They
fire --

THE MISSILES disappear into the spreading greyness Jt is
Spreading That needle of blackness is now about 50 feet
across Wait for the explosions They don’t come The
missiles don’t detonate Nothing returns from the stygian
blackness No light Nothing It is all-consuming

MAJ POWELL radios in air support -

HELICOPTERS and faster HARRIER JETS let loose with rockets
But it’s like throwing rocks into the Grand Canyon to fill
it up --

THE ROCKETS vanish into the conical violet-black
circumference --

A HELICOPTER buzzes too close to the dark light The
expanding cone clips a corner of the chopper --

The helicopter’s path suddenly changes as it wobbles like a
wounded bird and plummets out of the sky and crashes into

THE HELICOPTER

Where the beam bisected it in a circular pattern it has

- A withered empty husk Reduced
to a fraction of its mass All energy consumed from it
It is now pure waste Degraded to the dead carbon
building blocks of matter --

The circle cuts across the cockpit The PILOT leaps from
the craft SCREAMING with a pain never known before on this
earth --

He dies horribly before
the eyes of everyone there His desiccated arm and leg
crumbles with each movement His insides spill out through
the emptiness in his side Enough of this he falls

Milo buries his face in his hands --

RAY
Ugh

Powell is slack-jawed --

MAJ POWELL
What is it

MILO
Proof that Einstein knew his
stuff

THE CIRCLE OF DARK LIGHT continues to widen consuming more
and more on the ground beneath it --

And now out of the forest and trees race j i j
panic More than you would have thought still lived in
the hills around the city Birds rodents raccoons deer
a mountain lion Some have dark wounds from contact with
the energy-conversion SHRIEKING AND SCREAMING they race
across the clearing past the dumbstruck humans --

Though still far away the soldiers back away from the hill
in terror --

A young soldier turns to Powell looking for answers for
reassurance the fear cracking his voice --

SOLDIER
What do we do sir

Powell has no answer for the youth The kid backs up from
the névancing curtain of darkness
c

MAJ POWELL
Hold your ground

The conviction is gone from his voice

ALICIA RAY AND MILO watch --

THE CIRCLE OF ENERGY-CONVERTING DARKNESS encircles the
entire mountain top now and the edge of it creeps down the
hillside toward the clearing --

It’s moving faster now a geometric expansion --

The shriveled post-conversion dead matter is visible at
the edges of the darkness The remains of trees rocks
birds squirrels shrunken and lifeless --

RAY AND ALICIA hold their ground as the darkness advances
towards them Milo backs up slowly

ANGLE - ALICIA
She tears herself from Ray and runs Ray follows

RAY
Alicia

ALICIA
He needs help

Toward the Surfer Somehow she dodges soldiers and
equipment steps over roots as if she can see where she’s
going --

THE SURFER lays there unmoving --

RAY
What can we

Alicia reaches down to touch the Surfer’s face --

ANGLE - THE TOUCH

Contact Her hand on the Surfer A spark of light in that
touch Somehow that human contact heals the same way it
happened when they first met It should remind us of the
child whose life the Surfer

The Surfer’s hand rises to take hers --

Ray watches as --

The Surfer opens his eyes and gets to his feet --

SURFER
There is hope

THE SURFER gestures --

His board shackled and bound surges free slices through
the Adamantium netting like butter tipping the tanks and
jeeps that anchor the chains --

The board arcs through the air toward him --

THE SURFER seems rejuvenated when he holds it He rises
over the field the frightened soldiers toward the wall of
darkness advancing down the mountain His board lowers hin
to the ground at the edge of the energy conversion field

He stands facing the purple-black curtain Raises his
hand palm open and plunges it into the energy field

ON THE SURFER

As he grimaces in soul-destroying pain Weve never seen
him like this He’s a being of pure cosmic energy and
this field consumes energy The field engulfs his hand and
arm and stops

The field retreats back just beyond his fingertips The
Surfer stands in agony swirls of crimson-black smoke
evaporating lazily from where his arm had been immersed in
the field

The mammoth impenetrable wall of darkness distends bulging
outwards in an area that dwarfs the scene of onlooking
humans The distending outline reaches up the sphere a
quarter mile high as it takes on a vaguely human forn

A HUGE FIGURE steps from the darkness like a splitting
amoebae Human in shape God-like in proportion A
silhouette whose detail is incomprehensible directly
visible only in bas-relief contrast with the surroundings
Like a faint star we must look away to see A 3-D hologram
you need to stare at until your brain stops trying to
understand it and only then can you see it The shimmering
complexity of detail within is infinite and immense This
isGALACTUS

Within the silhouette chaos theory reigns The complexity
of detail constructed like a pattern of Mandelbrot
fractals infinitely repeated and regressed mathematical
variations It is disturbing to observe impossible to
comprehend Imagine a living black hole in human forn

Galactus steps away from the penumbra of blackness
Though seemingly composed of a complexity like billions of

organic circuit boards there is a face to Galactus He
turns toward the Surfer
The Surfer rides his board high in the air to face his
master Like a fly to a man the immensities of scale of
are amazing

MILO
This is big

Maj Powell sends his man at the giant form Bullets
mortars missiles vanish like pebbles in the ocean
Galactus just ignores then

RAY
(to Maj Powell)
Try talking trash about his
mother

Maj Powell glares at Ray --

MAJ POWELL
You think this is funny

RAY
Am I laughing yYou’re sending
your men to be killed Major It
doesn’t even know we’re here

MAJ POWELL
(desperate)
What do you suggest

No answer
The Surfer faces Galactus From Galactus comes a booming
pattern of sharp sounds CLICKS SNAPS CRACKS and TICKS
There’s a mathematical urgency to them like an irregular
metronome
MILO
I think it’s it’s speaking
RAY
Anybody here speak giant purple
alien
No But Milo listens intently

MILO
Of course

RAY
You’re kidding

Milo races for the army communications truck Ray runs
after hin

RAY
What You understand this

Milo talks as he moves fast

MILO
Not a click But I’ve got a
hunch

Maj Powell defers snaps orders to his communications
officers

MAJ POWELL
- Give him what he needs

INT MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

Milo flips open up his laptop computer works the keyboard
Ray rubs Milo’s shoulders --

MILO
It makes perfect sense

RAY
You can do it You’re the
man Who’s the man Youre
the man

Milo smiles He js the man

MILO
It’s math He’s talking in
math It’d have to be the
universal language

RAY
Come again

MILO
One plus one equals two
everywhere On earth out
there The physical universe
operates by pure mathematics
This Galactus communicates
through mathematical-based
language I can figure this
out

Milo pulls a Walkman out of his backpack and starts
connecting wires

I just need to record the

signal

Milo’s plugged the Walkman into the army’s bank of
equipment and --

ANGLE - THE MASSIVE MILITARY SPEAKER ARRAY

INT MOBILE COMMAND POST - COMMUNICATIONS BAY

The clicks and sounds come loud and clear through the
command post’s monitor speakers --

MILO
I’m just flipping the system so
I can use the speakers outside
as microphones to pick up the
sounds and run them back
through a standard decryption
algorithm

Connected Milo punches some keys The encryption program
comes up and starts running the sounds through a series of
procedures --

MILO

Let’s see If this thing’s as
universal as he thinks he is
his language should be self-
referential could we be
lucky enough that it contains
its own primer This might
take a whi

The computer settles on a protocol Milo’s almost
disappointed --

MILO
Oh wow Complexity ultimately
equals simplicity Look at
that It’s just a basic binary
code Any twelve year old
hacker could have decoded this

Milo and Ray read aloud from THE COMPUTER SCREEN
A series of mathematical formulas scroll across the screen

RAY
That’s a translation

MILO
Forget the grammar We’re
dealing with concepts

RAY
I get the picture

MILO
(unhappily)
It’s pretty clear He’s about
to consume our planet Like
the others By converting it
to pure energy

ALICIA
The Surfer is trying to talk to
him

MILO

It looks that way
The clicks and sounds get harsher angrier
ON SCREEN Must feed Energy
Galactus turns away back to his conversion field

The Surfer glows brightly a bolt of energy lances out
strikes Galactus in the back of the head Like a gnat

Galactus does not turn even around He raises his hands
and the conversion field resumes its advance

Galactus walks toward the energy field Though he towers
over the landscape like a Montana sunset the ground does
not shake when he walks He is energy as much as he is
mass The trees look like tall grass beside his leg

RAY
Soup’s on huh

MILO
Apparently

RAY

Can you get this thing to
translate the other way

MILO
What

RAY
So we can talk to him

A novel idea --

MILO
Maybe

RAY
Do it

Ray grabs the microphone Milo frantically re-programs
punches buttons --

RAY
(into the microphone)
Wait Listen

Ray’s voice booms across the countryside If Galactus has
any awareness of their tiny efforts he gives no sign of
it The Surfer glances their way though

IN THE COMMAND POST Milo continues to work furiously --

MAJ POWELL
Hurry

MILO
I’m trying

Ray’s voice suddenly switches over to binary clicks and
POPS still echoing over the landscape

RAY
Listen Don’t Please We’re
not food We’re people You
can’t eat us

MILO
Tell him why Ray

At a sudden loss Ray turns from the microphone to the
people around him --
RAY
Wait Why Why can’t he

They’re all dumbfounded too Except for Alicia --

ALICIA
Because because we’re
alive we think we feel
RAY

I don’t think he gives a

ANGLE - MILO’S WALKMAN

EXT MOUNTAIN CLEARING
US Army troops and equipment listen to the incongruous --

ETHEL MERMAN
I had a dream a dream about
you baby it’s gonna come
true baby they think that
were through

INSIDE THE MOBILE COMMAND POST

Milo scrambles to figure out what he did wrong --

MILO
Oops
RAY
Is that Ethel Merman
MILO
In Gypsy She was great
(embarrassed)

I like show tunes
ON THE SURFER AND GALACTUS

Ethel Merman still singing Galactus still walking toward
the energy field Suddenly slows mid-step --

ETHEL MERMAN
But baby you’ll be swell
you’ll be great gonna have
the whole world on a plate
starting here starting now

The Surfer looks down at the army command post --
Ray races to the door watches --

Galactus stops And turns Slowly To the source of the
sound Seems to cock slightly Is he listening

The energy field stops expanding
ETHEL MERMAN
Honey everything’s coming up
roses

Milo figures out the problem and presses the stop button on
the Walkman

Ray has noticed the effect on Galactus when the MUSIC
STOPS

RAY
Milo wait

MILO
What

RAY

He likes Merman

MILO
He likes it

© Alicia goes to Ray --

ALICIA
It’s music

RAY
It’s not mathematical

MILO
Of course It defies order
It’s illogical
(beat)
So what do we do Start
singing

Ray rushes to Milo’s set-up digs through his back-pack -

RAY
No What else you got

A soldier can’t help offering --

SOLDIER
I’ve got some Snoop
RAY
No I think it’s got to be
music
and The soldier is offended but everyone defers to the trio

Ray digs through Milo’s bag pulls out a tape --

RAY
Gershwin

He pops it into the Walkman The magical strains of
““Rhapsody in Blue’’ fills the clearing

Slowly monumentally Galactus turns full around to face
the music --

RAY

The Surfer descends to Alicia and Ray race --

GALACTUS stands motionless Really listening The energy
field remains unchanging

The Surfer gestures to his board Mounts and flies toward

the unmoving giant Up to his shoulder like Jiminy
Cricket

We can’t hear what they’re
saying unless I switch

RAY
No don’t touch it

They all just watch An eerie tableau The MUSIC playing
The soldiers waiting in futile readiness The alien giant
and his tiny herald Waiting

The music ends

Galactus seems to sigh draws himself up He turns toward
the Surfer offering finally to pay attention to him

The unintelligible binary mathematical dialogue resumes

between them filtering faintly back across the hillside to
Ray Alicia and Milo --

With startling suddenness Galactus waves his hand --
AND THEN SUDDENLY
SURPRISINGLY --
THE ENERGY FIELD DISSOLVES --
The blackness lifts Just evaporates
ON OUR HEROES
Wanting to breathe a sigh of relief but waiting --
Galactus walks gently back up the hill toward his ships

UP IN THE SKY the Surfer cuts and banks gracefully away
over the blackened landscape --

And settles down in front of Alicia and Ray On blackened
dead- ground while they are on the green still-growing
grass Maj Powers and his men keep their distance

Alicia breaks the silence --

ALICIA

universa he hes not axpariencad It It is unique It

RAY

RAY

years before couldn’t it

SURFER

Ray breaks out in a huge grin slaps the Surfer on the back

without thinking about it

RAY

Alicia turns to Ray and puts a hand to his mouth

RAY

humble Ray Ramsey the man

who saved the world
THEN A SHADOW LIFTS
GALACTUS’ SHIP withdraws into the skies --
Normal cloud patterns reassert themselves --
POWELL AND THE SOLDIERS
Return cautiously With salvation from larger
attention is re-directed The Surfer is again
ef scrutiny
THE SURFER turns to Alicia and Ray --

SURFER

Alicia reaches for the Surfer and kisses hin

The Surfer steps away --
SURFER

In the BG an army transport HELICOPTER bearing the
Presidential seal lands in the clearing Maj Powell runs
to it to meet the PRESIDENT and his staff They stride
authoritatively across the field toward the Surfer Alicia
Ray and Milo - TOWARD CAMERA AS --

SURFER
(gestures )

To me my board

The Surfer gestures and his board returns to him with a
theatrical flourish He mounts

IN THE BG Maj Powell nervously quickens his pace
ushering the President along --

THE SURFER SOARS --

MAJ POWELL
Hey wait a minute there

MUSIC UP The Surfer revels in his freedom takes one lap
around the clearing above everyone --

MAJ POWELL
You Surfer Come back here

Maj Powell is impotent and furious The President watches
in wonder

The Surfer arcs skyward towards the stars --
And is gone
Alicia takes Ray’s hand
Maj Powell catches up to then
MAJ POWELL
Whoa whoa The President’s
here
RAY
We’ve had a big day Major
Maybe another time

MAJ POWELL
What You can’t just

Ray gives him a look It’s just not that important at the
moment

RAY
Are we in trouble for saving
the world

Maj Powell bites his lip Looks back at the President who
nods Powell turns around and walks back to the clearing

RAY
So what kind of food do you

Milo catches up --
MILO

RAY

Then Ray looks at Alicia and softens puts an arm around
Milo’s shoulder

RAY
Were going to get some dinner
and figure out the best way to
sell this story to TV

Alicia gives Ray a stern look He‘s chastened

I’m kidding
On the three of them walking into the sunset
FADE
THE SILVER SURFER - IN SPACE

Soaring free on cosmic winds The earth curves below He
allows himself -—- a suile

INSERT GALACTUS

Seeing all Knowing all (almost) His energy flares with
anger From his ‘eyes’ twin violet beams of light lance
out --

EXT SPACE EARTH

‘From the receding silhouette of Galactus’ ship the two
crimson-purple beams race through space toward their mark --

THE SURFER is cut down in mid-flight as the cogmic rays
like twin daggers slice into him --

Blinding intense pain doubles him over throws him
effortlessly from his board The impact glows with
Galactus’ signature cosmic energy --
THE SURFER plummets lifeless earthward
The life-filled planet rises up fast --

curt
EXT CORN FIELD - SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA - DAY

A little boy races through the stalks It‘s CALVIN the
boy we saw on the airplane on p 10

VOICE (0S)
You cant hide you I11 find
you

Calvin runs frightened by something His arms pump
furiously --

Suddenly he stops short His jaw drops His eyes wide
He stares in wonder --

Lying at the bottom of a shallow crater the unmoving form
of the Silver Surfer

Looking back over his shoulder for an instant Calvin
scrambles down the crater for a closer look

VOICE Where are you

Calvin is in awe inches from the Surfer’s motionless body
Curiously tentatively gently his small hand reaches -

And touches the Surfer At the touch there is — small
glow pf cosmic energy and --

THE SURFER OPENS HIS EYES
FADE OUT

THE END
