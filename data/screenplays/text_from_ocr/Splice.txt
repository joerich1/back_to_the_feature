BLACKNESS

A MUFFLED HEARTBEAT Faster than normal and quickening
A SLIVER OF BLINDING LIGHT cuts through the darkness
revealing the constricting walls of a fleshy liquid-filled

chamber The walls close in squeezing us towards the light

Our heartbeat becomes LOUDER and FASTER The walls spasm
again with an oddly mechanical THROB

THRRRUMP - THRRRUMP — THRRRUMP

We are experiencing the POV of an infants birth The LIGHT
expands until we are engulfed in WHITENESS With a WET
FLUSHING SOUND we are abruptly spit from the womb

As our vision adjusts the WHITE LIGHT DIMINISHES until we
can make out colors and shapes and

INT BIRTHING CHAMBER -- DAY

MAINTAIN POV The faces of TWO MASKED DOCTORS lean in serious
and intent Behind them are SEVERAL ASSISTANTS One records
the event with a digital cam-corder

OUR HEARTBEAT bangs rapidly The male doctor CLIVE NICOLI
speaks

CLIVE
Vitals

The female doctor ELSA KAST glances at a bank of monitors

ELSA
Stable

CLIVE
Severing support

Clive deftly cuts the umbilical cord with a scalpel OUR
HEARTBEAT slows Subsiding The room grows dim

ASSISTANT
Dropping Dropping fast

A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE sounds from the panel Clive jerks his
head to the monitors annoyed Elsas eyes flit above her
mask to the vital signs to us back to Clive

ELSA
Do it

Clive leans in slapping with a rubber-gloved hand
CLIVE
Cmon spark
(desperate)

BREATHE DAMN IT

A SUDDEN CHOKING SOUND GURGLING And a GASPING FOR AIR
The HIGH-PITCHED WHINE turns silent We are SUCKING IN our
first breaths Our vision BRIGHTENS again

The Doctors relax Clive shakes his head delighted He
presses a stethoscope BENEATH OUR LINE OF VISION

CLIVE (CONTD)
Respiration stable

Elsa gathers us up in a white towel

ELSA
No obvious physical discrepancies

As she swings us around the lab towards a dome-covered
incubator we see that we have been birthed not from a mother
but from the latex mouth of an ARTIFICIAL BIRTHING MACHINE

CLIVE
(excited)
Hes perfect Hes just fucking
perfect

Elsa places us gently into A CRIB-LIKE bubble They pull
off their masks revealing beaming youthful faces

ELSA
(as a compliment to
Clive)
Of course He was brilliantly
conceived
CLIVE
(as a compliment to
Elsa)

And fabulously executed

He leans over and gives her a congratulatory kiss

INT NOVAPHORM LABS - CORRIDOR -- DAY

The lab is naked functional and illuminated under stultifying
florescent light This is the gritty reality of contemporary
genetic engineering

Clive and Elsa sans medical smocks wheel the pod-like
incubator down the corridor We get our first good look at
them

Clive early thirties is tall with spiky hair and a hunched
wiry grace Hes the kind of high school nerd who managed
to morph into college cool without ever realizing he was
once a nerd

Elsa about the same age sports a tangled brunette mane
accented by a single streak of white hair Shes a
firecracker brimming with happy self-assurance that comes
from a lifetime of being the smartest girl in the room

As they reach the end of the corridor Clive betrays a hint
of concern

CLIVE
Maybe we should wait

ELSA
They need to imprint

INT CONTAINMENT CHAMBER -- DAY

The door opens and Clive and Elsa roll in the incubator The
room is small and sterile

Clive crosses to a cage on the floor and releases a BIZARRELY
UNIDENTIFIABLE CREATURE She has the stance of a small
primate though her face is almost pig-like A long lizard
tail extends from the base of her spine Her skin is pale

a collection of bizarre orifices decorate her back

Despite her predominantly monstrous appearance there is
something sweet almost Buddha-like about her countenance

Elsa captures the moment with a SMALL CAMCORDER
CLIVE
Cmon Ginger Come meet your little
brother
GINGER crawls tentatively to the threshold of her cage
Clive breaks the seal on the dome and gathers up the NEWBORN

HYBRID This is our first view of FRED a smaller version
of Ginger Eyes blinking and bewildered

INT OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY

Clive and Elsas team observe this historic event from behind
a one-way mirror They watch enraptured as

INT CONTAINMENT CHAMBER -- DAY
Clive places Fred gently down on the floor near Ginger and

steps back Ginger cranes her neck sniffing the air
watching Fred with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation
ELSA
Its okay Ginger Hes family

GINGER ABRUPTLY JOLTS FORWARD lunging at the newborn with a
BLOOD-CURDLING SCREECH

Elsa GASPS Clive lurches to rescue

But Ginger does nothing Merely sniffs at the newborn
nudging it with her nose Fred emits a PURRING GURGLE

INT OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY

The team release a collective sigh of relief
INT CONTAINMENT CHAMBER -- DAY

Clive relaxes watches with fascination as

Excited Ginger lets out a SHORT SQUAWK then continues her
gentle smelling inspection A probing tongue cleans the
area around Freds eyes Elsa crouches in for a close-up
catching her breath

ELSA
See Love at first sight

INT HYPERSPACE LOUNGE -- NIGHT
An ultra-hip club

Clive hands THE BARTENDER some bills and departs from the
bar with an enormous tray of multi-colored shooters As he
pushes through the crowd we recognize several of his
colleagues from the lab each helping themselves to a shot
lightening his load

Among them is DEXTER forties Clives right hand man and
older less-impressive brother He nonetheless exudes
unadulterated fraternal pride giving Clive a crushing hug
which nearly sends the tray flying

DEXTER
You did it Maestro

CLIVE
(sweetly)
We did it And stop calling me
that Im your brother for fucks
sake

DEXTER
Ill only stop saying it when you
stop being brilliant Maestro

Dexter releases him and Clive continues through the group
distributing shots and getting congratulatory slaps on the
back He finally arrives at the corner booth where Elsa is
deep in discussion with MELINDA FINCH a smartly dressed
reporter from WIRED magazine FLASH A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps
photos while they talk

He watches admiring from a short distance away preferring
Elsa to take the spotlight

MELINDA
Your critics say by combining such
disparate animals youre violating
the natural order of things

ELSA
There was a time when it was
considered unnatural to perform
surgery

MELINDA
Still its quite a leap to go from
mending bodies to redesigning them
Do you really think the worlds ready
for Ginger and Fred

ELSA
Why not Chimeras have been with us
for thousands of years Since the
earliest myths I see them as
signposts for the future For our

evolution
MELINDA

That sounds almost spiritual
ELSA

You could say its our religion

She casts a glance at Clive who watches admiring from the
shadows

FLASH

INT HYPERSPACE CLUB - MENS ROOM -- NIGHT

Clive and Elsa burst into a cubicle hands and lips all over
each other They look as though theyre on the verge of
having sex right there

CLIVE
Fuck youre hot in an interview

ELSA
You think

While Clive nibbles at her ear Elsa brandishes a liquid
dropper

ELSA (CONTD)
Ready to bust loose

Clive pulls back eyes the dropper warily

CLIVE
(hesitant)
That more of your home brew

ELSA
Afraid

CLIVE
After last time Very

ELSA
I decreased the c-AMP formations
Itll be a smooth ride Promise

She squeezes a few pearls of liquid onto her tongue looks
at him daring The temptation is too great Clive plants
his mouth over hers sharing in the dose

CLIVE
Things are going to get weird now
arent they

Elsa nods enthusiastically

INT HYPERSPACE LOUNGE -- LATER

The drug has kicked in The night explodes with NOISE and
COLORS as the dance floor surges Clive and Elsa weave
through the crowd At every step co-workers friends and
acquaintances shake their hands pat their backs kiss cheeks
showering them with nonstop affirmation

Elsa pulls Clive onto the dance floor They bounce in time
with the wave of other bodies but somehow see only each other
This is a portrait of two people deeply in love

Clive leans in for another kiss but his attention is drawn
to a BALD MAN on the edge of the dance floor conspicuously
immobile among the gyrating mob

BALD MAN
Clive Elsa

Elsa smiles expecting some kind of fan banter Still
smiling the Bald Man fumbles with something under his coat

And pulls out a short-muzzled shot gun

BALD MAN (CONTD)
(calm)
Stop playing God

He calmly BLASTS A SHOT into Clives chest Clive flies
backwards collapsing onto the dance floor Elsa SCREAMS

The music stops A chilling HUSH descends on the room

The bald man drops his gun and makes for the exit but hes
immediately tackled by BOUNCERS and Clive and Elsas team
Dexter looks to Elsa frozen over Clives bloodied body

He fumbles with his cell pounding 911 into the keypad

Elsa stares at Clive uncomprehending her world suddenly
turned upside down She leans down to touch him when

Clives eyes snap open

Elsa lets out a YELP falls to her knees as Clive struggles
up on one elbow

CLIVE
Hey babe Guess what

He holds up one hand dabs his tongue with a bloody finger

CLIVE (CONTD)
God plays paintball

Elsas face explodes with joy and relief She tackles him
in a crushing embrace

FLASH Melinda and her photographer are there taking photos
of the whole unbelievable scene

INT CLIVE AND ELSAS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

The modest apartment is overflowing with electronics DVDs

comic books movie posters toys and other expensive pop
junk This is what happens when geeks get an income

Clive and Elsa tumble in snapping on the lights still riding

the combined high of alcohol drugs and adrenaline Clives
shirt sports an explosion of red paint across the chest

ELSA
What I dont understand is why he
didnt want to shoot me I mean of
course a Right-Wing nutbar like that
is incapable of believing a woman
could be the head of an important
scientific breakthrough but still
CLIVE
Youre jealous
ELSA
No Im not
CLIVE
You are You have ‘assassination
envy
ELSA
Shut up

They stumble towards
THE BEDROOM
Where Elsa drunkenly pulls at Clives bloody shirt buttons

ELSA (CONTD)
Lets get this thing off of you

CLIVE
(wincing)
Careful

She pulls back the fabric revealing a broad red welt across
his left-side pectoral Or possibly its the stain of red
paint on his skin She leans in and kisses his chest

CLIVE (CONTD)
You know its interesting For that
moment when I thought I was shot
all the cliches were true Time
seemed to slow down I think I even
saw a heavenly light

ELSA
(between kisses)
Endorphins horomone secretions to
the central nervous system
Increases awareness and reaction
time in moments of crisis part of
the survival mechanism

Clive is becoming aroused perhaps as much from Elsas
clinical banter as her touch

CLIVE
I wonder if that applies to all
species not just ones with higher

brain functions

He deftly unsnaps Elsas bra and lifts it shirt and all
over her head
ELSA
Probably not Visual perceptions
contained within the occipital lobe

Clive drops Elsa onto the bed and starts peeling off her
jeans

CLIVE
Some subspecies of salamander have
something that approximates an
occipital lobe

Stripped to her panties she pulls Clive down onto the bed
with her

ELSA
Enough

She plants her lips over his effectively shutting him up
then reaches for the drawer of the bed table

CLIVE
Hey wait a sec

Elsa pulls out a string of condoms

ELSA
What
CLIVE
Why dont we forget it Just this
once
ELSA
I dont think so
CLIVE
Whats the worst that could happen
ELSA
Youre a genetic engineer figure it
out
CLIVE

Would that be the end of the world

ELSA
Were on a mission remember Its
not a good time

CLIVE
Theres never going to be a good
time

ELSA

How about after we crack male
pregnancy

CLIVE
And ruin this perfect figure

ELSA
Hypocrite

Clive laughs relenting Then for a moment grows serious

CLIVE
You know what I was really thinking
of when I was shot That Id never
see you again

Elsa contemplates this Its unimaginable

ELSA
Dont even say that Id never let
it happen

Elsa leans over to turn the light off The room snaps into
DARKNESS The sound of a TEARING CONDOM PACKAGE

EXT NOVAPHORM - DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

We stare up at the downtown headquarters of Novaphorm Bio-
Research Inc Its a TOWERING STEEL MONUMENT to corporate
anonymity

BARLOW (0S)
I wish you guys would fill me in on
this presentation

INT NOVAPHORM - DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - CORRIDOR -- DAY

Clive and Elsa are led hastily down a long pristine corridor
by their project manager WILLIAM BARLOW fifties A natural-
born bureaucrat Barlow can barely suppress his feckless
panic

BARLOW
I mean not that I dont have absolute
faith but as your project manager
I like to think that I can be a
sounding-board

CLIVE
Relax Its just another dog and
pony show

ELSA
Hey we could splice a dog and a

pony

CLIVE
Then it could do the presentation
for us

Barlow offers a hollow chuckle

ELSA
Itll be mind-blowing Bill Trust
us

BARLOW
As mind-blowing as last months party

CLIVE
Something like that

BARLOW
Now that was a joke
(to Elsa)
He is joking right
(to Clive)
I had to do a lot of damage control
after that incident

ELSA
It was just a party

Elsa pops NERD candies into her mouth crunching them loudly

BARLOW
A party that Wired was invited to

Barlow shakes a copy of the new issue of Wired magazine
turns to an earmarked page featuring a photo of Clive and
Elsa -- blood-splattered on the dance floor

BARLOW (CONTD)
If God didnt want us to explore
his domain whyd he give us the
map

ELSA
Bumper-sticker wisdom

Elsa bites down loudly on a Nerd Barlow grimaces as though
she were biting down on his nerves

BARLOW
Im just asking Please Youve
got Joan Klein and the entire
management team of this division
upstairs Be sensitive to their
concerns You know the hand
that feeds and all that

Clive gives Barlow a reassuring pat on his shoulder

CLIVE
Were gonna feed the hand until its
blue in the face Theyll love it

They step into a waiting elevator Barlow looks not the least
bit assured

INT NOVAPHORM CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

A large conference room located in the stratosphere of
Novaphorm headquarters A gathering of EXECUTIVES

Barlow stands off to the side eyeing the Novaphorm team
nervously In particular he monitors the reaction of JOAN
KLEIN Novaphorms new Chief of Operations In her 50s
Joan is a well-starched bundle of cold candor

CLIVE
The H-40 chimeras exceeded all
expectations in their ability to
produce medicinal proteins for
livestock

A power point presentation flashes images of Ginger and Fred
graphs stats etc in the background

ELSA
And now with the birth of Fred we
have a proven technique for braid-
pairing which can be applied to the
most sophisticated of organisms
Namely

The color drains from Barlows face He looks to Elsa
pleading with his eyes She catches this look and continues
with gleeful abandon

ELSA (CONTD)
Human beings

The screen behind transitions from Ginger and Fred to an
image of Da Vincis VITRUVIAN MAN A murmur among the
assembled

CLIVE
By incorporating human DNA into the
hybrid template we might have the
key to curing any number of human
diseases

ELSA
Parkinsons Liver damage Epilepsy
And the grailCancer cure

A terrible moment of suspended silence as Clive and Elsa
wait for the reaction
Joan clears her throat All eyes snap to her

JOAN

Extraordinary Simply extraordinary

(to the assembled)
I dont think I exaggerate when I
say that Clive and Elsa represent
the future Not just for this
corporation but for the entire field
of bio-engineering

Clive and Elsa share an excited hopeful glance

JOAN (CONTD)
(to Clive and Elsa)
And that is why it is time to move
on to Phase 2

ELSA
Phase 2

JOAN
Yes The product stage We need to
isolate the gene in Ginger and Fred
which produces your magic protein
CD-356 Were shutting down the
splicing facilities Retooling your
labs for intensive chemical analysis

For the first time Clive and Elsa look caught off-guard

CLIVE
Shutting down

ELSA
But what about our proposal

JOAN
Very impressive But it sounds like
a longterm goal That is not what
Novaphorm needs at this time

ELSA
Proceeding to human splicing was
always part of our plan Its what
we signed on for

BARLOW

Elsa we all know that cant happen
right now Moral outrage will have
politicians and regulators tearing
us to pieces

(beat)
Christ you mixed a few animals and
it practically got you shot

CLIVE
But youre lobbying for an exploratory
license Right

Barlows silence gives Clive his answer

CLIVE (CONTD)
You promised When we signed our
contracts You said

BARLOW
What I said was I would do everything
I possibly could
(beat)
This is not the time Theres nothing
to be done on that front right now

Elsas face tightens Joan leans forward in her seat

JOAN
Look Wed love to cure all those
things Of course we would Nothing
would make us prouder as a company
As human beings

(beat)
You put a viable livestock product
on the shelves Then we can talk
about a twenty year plan to save the
world

(beat)

Right now we need to start Phase 2
And youre the only ones who can do
it

Clive and Elsa stare despondently at the room of stony faces

INT NOVAPHORM HEADQUARTERS - UNDERGROUND PARKING -- DAY

Elsa and Clive are pissed their shoes CLATTERING LOUDLY
through Novaphorms underground parking facility

CLIVE
We could quit Go to Hamilton-
Splinter

ELSA

Novaphorm owns our patents Wed
lose everything

Elsa ducks into a bright red GTO their car slamming the
door loudly

INT CLIVE AND ELSAS CAR -- DAY

Clive turns the key in the ignition Eight cylinders jump
to life Elsa stares through the windshield at the cement

wall before them seeing through it beyond their limits

CLIVE
So What

ELSA
I am not spending the next five years
pulling pap smears from swine

Elsa turns to Clive her eyes burning with ambition her
mouth betraying a trace of smile

Theres a moment Elsas determination pulverizes any
reluctance Clive might possess Not a word is spoken but
we can see it in their faces They are going to do this
thing

Abruptly Clive throws the car into reverse and they SCREECH
out of the lot

EXT INDUSTRIAL PARK -- DAY

Clive and Elsas muscle car blazes through an anonymous set
of buildings Passes quickly through a security gate parks
in a private spot

INT SECURITY ENTRANCE LAB -- DAY

Clive and Elsa approach the desk of YUJI a dreadlocked
Japanese security guard reading a Hentai (porn) comic book

YUJI
Dr C and E wassup

Elsa leans over his desk hits the door release button
buzzing them through

YUJI (CONTD)
Yo thats my whole job description

ELSA
Sorry In a hurry

then follows Clive down the hall to
INT GRUNT ROOM -- DAY

Home to a motley horde of BIO-SPECIALISTS and TECHIES many
glimpsed at the party now prisoner to cramped work stations

The staff greet Clive and Elsa like geek royalty as they
hustle through the room dodging an obstacle course of
biohazard garbage containers pipette bins and bacteria
shakers as they head for

INT SPLICING LAB -- DAY

An empty sterile room is suddenly filled with pounding funky
hip-hop hyper-beat trance fusion music

Clive slides into view on a wheeled chair Powers up a wall
of hard-drives They sound like jet engines winding up

At a nearby table with her back to him Elsa prepares tiny
vials with liquid samples

CLIVE
Whats the donor profile

ELSA
Healthy female Clean medical and
heredity The usual

Clive his mind still in the microscope is barely listening

CLIVE
Dime a dozen

ELSA
One in a million

INT MOLECULAR SPACE -- CONTINUOUS

The MUSIC continues under A MICROSCOPIC VIEW of Clive and Elsas
DNA splicing experiment

We watch free-falling clusters of proteins and spiraling
double-helixes that constitute DNA molecules

CLIVE (0S)
Its not working They wont fuse

We see breaks forming between the base pairs that link the
coils but as other open pairs slide into place interfering
helixes bounce into the mix preventing successful coupling

ELSA (0S)
What enzyme are you using

CLIVE (0S)
Its not the breakage Theyre
breaking fine

ELSA (0S)
So

Identically colored helixes through random bouncing chaos
actively resist bonding with other multicolored molecules
Instead they merge again with their own kind

CLIVE (0S)
They keep coupling with themselves

23 INT SPLICING LAB -- MORNING

Early morning light pours through the window Clive raises
a bloodshot eye from the microscope

CLIVE

Its like they refuse
ELSA

Thats crazy Well make them
CLIVE

What makes you so sure we can
ELSA

Because Wired doesnt interview

losers
Clive takes a deep gulp of black coffee
CLIVE
Sometimes I forget those basic

scientific principals

Clive fills a syringe with yet another enzyme hunkering
back into the work

DISSOLVE TO

Its night again Clive studies the microscopes video-tap
with a look of anticipation that quickly turns to disgust

CLIVE (CONTD)
Its fucked

He drops back in his chair defeated

CLIVE (CONTD)
Maybe Bills right Maybe its not
the right time

This fires up Elsa

ELSA
Thats why its the right time

She paces the room The techno music hammering into her
brain

ELSA (CONTD)
This retarded fascist uber-musik is
the problem Its got us thinking
in circles

She rips out the CD leafs briskly through the collection
Finds just the right thing Hits play

The room warms up under the gentle strains of FRANK SINATRA
crooning COLE PORTERS UNDER MY SKIN

Clive looks up at Elsa Something about the music is making
her brain switch gears

CLIVE
Youre right Weve been dancing to
the wrong beat
Elsa lights up seeing the glow of inspiration in his eyes
DISSOLVE TO

Morning again Elsa hands Clive a dropper of fluid

ELSA
Try this

Clive squeezes a few drops into the solution under the
microscope

CLIVE
Its not work-- Wait Its
happening

His head springs from the eyepiece

ELSA
Why now

Elsas dancing on her toes

CLIVE
We blocked the uricil
ELSA
So the feed is cut
CLIVE
Theres confusion
ELSA
(understanding)

We blew the whistle

CLIVE
Reintroduce Restart the music

Elsa introduces two new fluids to the mix They take quick
turns looking into the eyepiece

ELSA
(excited)
Theyre changing partners

CLIVE
Everyone dances with everyone

ELSA
(joyous)
Youre Bob fucking Fosse

She slings her arms around Clive spraying him with kisses

INT NUCLEAR TRANSFER ROOM -- DAY

A very tired-looking Clive plugs in the last piece of the
massive jigsaw puzzle of adenine thymine guanine and
cytosine

Elsa kisses the displayed graphic on the screen

The screen flashes H-50 GENOME COMPLETE

INT COLD ROOM -- DAY

Elsa and Clive wheel a Dewar tank a storage box for genetic
material into a walk-in freezer

CLIVE
All right Bio-technologys most
startling breakthrough in decades
on ice

Clive and Elsa share a grim anti-climactic sigh Then Elsa
gives him a mischievous look She does a U-turn and wheels
the tank out of the room

CLIVE (CONTD)
El where are you going

INT CORRIDOR LAB -- DAY

Elsa wheels the Dewar tank down the hall Clive races to
keep up

CLIVE
Yo white-stripe Quit screwing
around

She runs like a mischievous school girl into
INT BIRTHING ROOM -- DAY

Elsa enters shuts and locks the door Clive bangs on it
from the other side

CLIVE

(through door)
What are you doing Hello E1

(MORE)

CLIVE (CONTD)
(no response)
This is whats known in couple therapy
as ‘emotional high-jacking

Elsa removes the lid of the canister Mist swirls around
the opening like a prop in a magic show

CLIVE (CONTD)
(through door)
Youre being a bad responder to my
‘inquisition statement’

Using a pair of tongs she removes a plastic cartridge
containing the spliced genetic material

CLIVE (CONTD)
(through door becoming
serious)
El human clonings illegal

ELSA
This wont be human Not entirely

She snaps the cartridge into a servo-guided injection needle
A monitor flickers to life displaying an enlarged image of
a human egg Its nucleus is hollowed out

INT CORRIDOR -- DAY
Clive fumbles through his pockets

CLIVE
Seriously Stop it

He finds a swipe card
INT BIRTHING ROOM -- DAY

The door unlocks Clive enters and quickly shuts it behind
him He gets between her and the controls

CLIVE
We could go to jail

ELSA
Relax We wont take it to term
We just need to find out if we can
generate a sustainable organism
Then we destroy it Nobody will
ever know

CLIVE
Whats the point if we cant publish

ELSA
To be sure we really did it To
know for sure
(beat)
Are you telling me you dont need to
know

Clive shifts on his feet Shes hitting all the right
buttons Still he remains in the grip of reason

CLIVE
Its not that simple
(beat)
There are moral considerations

Elsa raises her eyebrows She glances at the glowing red
button

ELSA
Millions of people are suffering and
dying with no hope We might be
sitting on the key to save them
What are the moral considerations of
that

Clive swallows hard Her reasoning has trumped his He
follows her gaze to the crimson lit plastic His mouth
tightens

ELSA (CONTD)
I know you want to

Clives hand reaches out
CLICK
Hes hit the button

Instantly the needle is inserted into the egg and the genetic
material is injected into the empty nucleus

Conception

CLIVE
Fuck

ELSA
Exactly

An extruding platform carries the petri dish into the inutero
gestation chamber

A view of the egg appears ON SCREEN

ELSA (CONTD)
Its not too late to abort

Clive watches enraptured as the petri dish dissolves in the
murky fluid environment cells replicating at an unnaturally
high rate gene markers radiating like twinkling stars

The process is almost mystical

CLIVE
No Not yet

He puts a reassuring arm around her

CLIVE (CONTD)
I want to know

INT GESTATION CHAMBER -- DAY

In TIME LAPSE we see the cells replicate exponentially
growing in numbers from a few hundred to thousands millions
and then billions Blood veins flesh and bone stitch
together

INT MAIN LAB -- DAY

Clive walks past a shelf of large specimen jars Like a
disturbing carnival exhibition they are an inventory of
past splicing attempts Each appears to represent a
successive wrung up the evolutionary ladder And each is
labelled with the names of famous celebrity couples Brad
and Angelina Sonny and Cher Ashton and Demi Bogart
and Bacall

-Ending at two cages Ginger and Fred

We see that Fred has grown almost to Gingers size They bob
and coo as Clive checks the readings on clipboards hooked to
the bars Dexter hovers nearby

DEXTER
Hey Maestro everything okay

CLIVE
Yeah great You

DEXTER

Sure I guess Whaddya gonna do
Orders is orders Well nail that
gene

(beat)
But uh I cant help but notice
you and Elsa have been busy with
something

Clive looks up from his chart A tense beat he smiles

CLIVE
Building you an Elsa all for yourself

DEXTER
Nice Ill be sure not to tell the
wife

CLIVE

Our secret

Clive gives Dexter a conspiratorial wink and moves on to
inspecting the rest of the lab

INT BIRTHING CHAMBER -- DAY

Elsa orbits the gestation chamber recording stats

She calls up an ultrasound feed The murky image of a shape
that in no way approximates a normal fetus appears It pulses

rhythmically in its liquid environment THROB-THROB THROB-
THROB THROB-THROB THROB THROB TH

It STOPS

Elsas brow creases with worry She chews nervously on her
pen

ELSA
Come on

THROB THROB-THROB THROB-THROB THROB-THROB the pulse
resumes

Elsa sighs with relief She turns to a calendar and marks
off a square DAY 26

INT OPEN HOUSE -- DAY

A well-appointed REAL ESTATE AGENT walks Clive and Elsa
through a very chic and very expensive loft-style apartment

REAL ESTATE AGENT
Its a fusion of art nouveau and
sixties futurism Six figures but
the owner will negotiate

LATER

Clive and Elsa confer in one corner while the Real Estate
Agent waits to the side

ELSA
I fucking love it

CLIVE
Yeah Its cool

ELSA
You dont sound so enthusiastic Is
it too expensive

CLIVE
No
ELSA
Then what
CLIVE
Its just I dont want to have

to move again any time soon

ELSA
Why would we have to move again

CLIVE
It might not be big enough

ELSA
Its twice the size of our apartment
Theres more than enough room for
all our stuff

CLIVE
Yeah but But you know For down
the road

Elsa can see that Clive is hedging around her questions

ELSA
Youre talking about a kid arent
you

CLIVE

Is that so unreasonable

ELSA
Uh yeah Cause Im the one who has
to have it Jeeze Whats wrong
with you Guys arent even supposed
to want kids

CLIVE
Thats not true And I dont see
whats wrong with it

ELSA
This is whats wrong I like this
place I dont want to bend my life
to suit a third party that doesnt
even exist yet I want control over
my life You know how important
that is for me

Clive is about to respond when his Blackberry begins to chime

ELSA (CONTD)

What
CLIVE
(looking at the
Blackberry )
Its an alarm From the lab
Somethings wrong With the gestation
cell

OFF Elsas concerned look

EXT CITY STREET -- NIGHT

Clive and Elsas GTO races to their lab

INT CAR -- TRAVELING -- NIGHT

Clive drives like a madman Elsa riding shotgun

ELSA
(worried)
Do you think someone found it

CLIVE
You mean shut it down
(to reassure her but
not believing it)
Nah probably a power surge or a
glitch Im sure everythings fine

Nevertheless Clive floors it

EXT LAB -- NIGHT

Clive and Elsa reach the entrance but the door is locked
The security desk is empty theres no Yuji just a sign

that reads Gone for Ramen

YUJI (0OS)
Yo Dr C and E

Through the glass door Yuji can be seen shambling down the
hall with Rastafarian cool and a steaming cup of noodles

ELSA
Open the fucking door please

INT BIRTHING ROOM LAB -- NIGHT
The door opens and Clive and Elsa rush in At the end of
the room the artificial womb is belching and groaning fluid

freely gushing from its chrome hull

Clive glances at the monitor PREPARING BREACH OF FETAL
MEMBRANE

ELSA
Somethings wrong

FLOOSH The machine spews more fluid Louder GROANING

CLIVE
Its trying to come out

ELSA
Its too soon Way too soon

Clive and Elsa quickly throw on medical gowns masks and
gloves The machine contracts again a wave of fluid flushes
out Nothing else Elsa checks the ultrasound

ELSA (CONTD)
Its grown Its too big

The machine emits a METALLIC CREAK

CLIVE
The pressure will kill it

Elsa hits a button on the side of the machine The PULSING
GROAN winds down to a soft hum The flushing of fluid
subsides and the machines orifice dilates Elsa wedges her
arm inside Clive watches apprehensive

ELSA
Come on come on
(up to her elbow)
Slippery I cant

Elsa finally seems to get a grip when her arm is abruptly
yanked deeper into the machine Her chin bangs against the
hull She lets out a startled yelp

CLIVE
What is it

Tears well in Elsas terrified eyes

ELSA
Its Biting

CLIVE
Hold on

Clive snaps into action He fumbles with a series of hand-
bolts along the hull With the last clasp unlocked hes
able to open the entire chassis releasing a torrent of
viscous fluid and revealing

A DARK BLOB OF FLESH with a long serpentine tail wrapped
around Elsas wrist

Responding to the sudden light the FLESHY BULK releases
Elsas hand and rolls to the floor with a wet SLAP

It spasms and writhes on the spot like a horrid featureless
abortion The stinger-tipped tail whips about frantically

Clive rips the dome off the incubator and drops it over the
creature effectively trapping it

Meanwhile Elsas hand is SWELLING inside the torn rubber
glove She pulls it away to reveal horrible lacerations
where she has been stung repeatedly

CLIVE (CONTD)
Hold still

But Elsa is losing control of her motor functions Her mouth
contorts strangely her eyes roll She falls to her knees
then onto her back convulsing on the hard tile floor

CLIVE (CONTD)
Elsa

Clive ties the rubber glove around her arm cutting
circulation then rushes to a FIRST-AID CABINET With
surprisingly steady hands he jams an epi-pen between his
teeth then fills a huge syringe from a bottle of clear fluid

Clive drops to his knees at Elsas side By now she is
completely immobile eyes rolled back in her head barely
perceptible shaking in one leg Shes stopped breathing

Though his hands and movements are steady Clives face is
awash with terror He jabs the epi-pen into her shoulder

CLIVE (CONTD)
Hang in there Ive got you

Clive feels for a spot between two ribs takes a deep breath
then plunges the large syringe into her chest He watches
desperately as nothing happens

Then abruptly Elsas lungs burst to life She is GASPING
for breath Her irises roll back where they belong She
grabs his arm chest heaving

ELSA
What Whatwas that

Clive looks to the creature trapped under the incubator lid

CLIVE
A mistake

INT OBSERVATION ROOM -- NIGHT
Elsa arm in a sling watches as Clive wheels the incubator
containing the creature into the containment chamber and
seals the door shut
Elsa stands unsteady Clive approaches holds her close
INT CLIVE AND ELSAS APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- DAWN
The pale light of dawn creeps into the room Elsa is sound

asleep while Clive tosses and turns Finally Clive shakes
Elsas leg startling her awake

CLIVE

Do you think its in pain
ELSA

Huh What
CLIVE

Do you think its in pain

ELSA
Why would it be in pain

CLIVE
Because its not formed right

ELSA
That doesnt mean its in pain

CLIVE
Yeah It probably does

Clive stares at the ceiling Elsa isnt sure how to respond

ELSA
Alright Maybe

CLIVE
Im going to kill it

Elsa is more fully awake She props herself up on an elbow

ELSA
Theres still a lot we can learn
(beat)
Find out how close we came To
something sustainable

Clive whips back the sheets sitting up Hes clearly upset

ELSA (CONTD)
Its okay Clive its all right

CLIVE
Its not all right Its wrong

INT OBSERVATION ROOM -- MORNING

The Hybrid is trapped inside the incubator which in turn is
sealed within the containment chamber Clive and Elsa stand
by the door They have taken the added precaution of wearing
full-body hermetic suits with helmets

IN THE CONTAINMENT ROOM

The door opens and Clive and Elsa enter The Hybrid lies
utterly still in its glass prison

ELSA
Is it dead

Clive reaches a hand into one of the thick rubber gloves
built into the side of the pod

ELSA (CONTD)
Careful

-And gently prods the carcass Nothing Dead as dirt

ELSA (CONTD)
Well its not in pain now

CLIVE
Ill bag it

Clive passes through to the OBSERVATION ROOM the door
shutting behind him

Elsa opens the lid of the incubator for a closer look at the
creature Shes puzzled to find the locking clasp coated in
a sticky secretion and rattling loosely off the lid With
her gloved hands she rolls the Hybrid over There is a
gaping hole in its underbelly Its just a hollow
exoskeleton

ELSA
(to herself)
Empty

The realization dawns on her that whatever shed this skin
might still be alive And broken out of the pod

Something skitters noiselessly across the floor behind her

ELSA (CONTD)
Clive

OBSERVATION ROOM

Out of earshot Clive pulls a haz-mat bag from a drawer
CONTAINMENT CHAMBER
Now seriously afraid Elsa looks around the room The limited
view afforded by her helmet forces her to clock her entire
body The room appears empty

She slowly turns

RIGHT INTO THE FACE OF THE CREATURE hanging suspended upside-
down from the molding in the ceiling

Elsa SCREAMS and jumps back

The creature drops from its perch landing awkwardly on the
ground It rights itself on unsteady feet

Elsa reacts getting her first good look at the thing

The Hybrid has morphed into A SMALL BALD FEMALE CHILD A
profoundly malformed child Its eyes are set on the sides

of its head Arms are absent Legs are triple-jointed ending
with prehensile feet The LONG TAIL with a BARBED TIP is

the only feature it has retained from its previous
incarnation

The overall package seems incomplete even the skin has not
fully formed leaving an IRREGULAR LESION vertically bisecting
it from head to crotch

The creature hisses and whips its venomous tail

ELSA (CONTD)
CLIVE

OBSERVATION ROOM

Clive turns to the window From his angle he can only see
the abject terror in Elsas face

CLIVE
Whats the matter

ELSA
Its alive

Clive cranes his neck sees the creature finally between
Elsa and the door her only way out

CLIVE
Jesus

He is about to enter but Elsa warns

ELSA (0S)
Dont Itll get out

CONTAINMENT CHAMBER

The creature becomes increasingly agitated by Elsas presence
She shuffles a careful step sideways

And the Hybrid bolts at her Elsa reflexively covers herself
OBSERVATION ROOM

Clive watches helpless as the Hybrid tears clumsily over
Elsas body literally bouncing off the window before
scurrying into a corner of the room

CLIVE
Get out Im going to gas it

CONTAINMENT CHAMBER

Elsa gathers herself She has a clear path to the door now
She sees the Hybrid cowering in the corner senses its fear

ELSA
Wait Dont kill it

CLIVE
(over the intercom)
Elsa get out Im hitting the gas
In THREE

Elsa brings herself down to the Hybrids level The Hybrid
opens its child-like mouth revealing a toothless gummy maw
and releases a HORRIFIC SCREECH

CLIVE (CONTD)
(over the intercom)
TWO

Elsa is clearly disturbed by the force of this outburst

The Screech HOLDS ITS NOTE for a long moment before changing
in timbre slowly fading into a MOURNFUL WAIL - like the cry
of a bawling baby

ELSA
(near whisper)
Its okay I wont hurt you
CLIVE
(over intercom)
ONE

ELSA
Clive I said DONT

Elsa rips off her helmet

OBSERVATION ROOM

Clive cant believe it His hand is on a valve ready to
terminate the creature He leans into the intercom

CLIVE
Elsa Put on your helmet damn it

CONTAINMENT CHAMBER

An extraordinary thing happens At the sight of Elsas exposed
face the Hybrid calms Its as if the creature recognizes
something familiar in her

ELSA
Its imprinting

CLIVE
(over intercom)
Its dangerous Get out

Elsa is too caught up in the magic of this moment

ELSA
(to Hybrid)
Im not going to hurt you

Elsa waddlewalks closer to the creature It cocks its head
to one side in nervous flitting bird-like movements But
it no longer seems as frightened

ELSA (CONTD)
Youre really something arent you

Elsa removes the glove from her unharmed hand and gingerly
extends it for the Hybrid

The creature gives it a few cautionary sniffs Elsas scent
seems to meet its approval It blinks sideways with
nictitating eyelids and takes a cautious hop forward

Elsa smiles

ELSA (CONTD)
Thats it

Suddenly the creatures face curls into a snarl It hisses
and its tail flails out defensively Elsa reacts waddling
backwards confused until she realizes the creature is
actually reacting to

CLIVE
-Behind her helmeted and wielding a metal prod like a
weapon He grabs her and forcibly pulls her from the room

quickly shutting and locking the door behind them

The creature stares after them frightened and confused

INT OBSERVATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Clive is furious
CLIVE
Are you crazy Are you trying to

get yourself killed

ELSA
I had the situation under control

CLIVE
Youre forgetting why we came here

ELSA
We cant do that now Look at it

Clive cant believe what hes hearing

CLIVE
So what

Elsa virtually hip-checks him away from the panel and gets
her hands on a series of valves

ELSA
Lets just knock it out -- Find out
what weve got

Elsa turns on a combination of gas valves

INT CONTAINMENT CHAMBER -- MORNING

Vents open in the walls A HISS The creature sniffs the
air cowers from the encroaching gas

INT OBSERVATION ROOM -- MORNING

Clive observes Elsa watching coolly as the creature flutters
around the room like a butterfly in a jar until it finally
succumbs to the fumes

INT MRI CHAMBER -- LATER

The Hybrid breathes with a deep sharp wheezing as it lies
in forced slumber in a cylinder-shaped MRI MACHINE

A LOUD HUM AND FLASHING LIGHTS as the machine scans her
anatomy

INT ANALYSIS LAB -- CONTINUOUS

Images from the MRI play out on a computer screen

The Hybrid now lies strapped to a table while Elsa prods at
its tail Clive cant suppress his amazement

CLIVE
This is unbelievable I dont know
what half of this is

ELSA
Must have been some rogue elements
Junk genes pushing through

Elsa presses a gloved-thumb beneath its tip and a SHARP SPIKE
protrudes from a hood of skin It drips with a sticky goo
that Elsa smears onto a slide

ELSA (CONTD)
Some kind of self-defense mechanism

CLIVE
Or attack venom

ELSA
None of her animal components have
predatory characteristics

CLIVE
Well theres the human element

Elsa gives him a wry smirk Clive shifts his attention to
the computer output from the MRI A series of cross-section
X-rays flicker on the screen

CLIVE (CONTD)
What are these dark splotches

Elsa looks up from examining blood samples On the screen
Clive points out two jet-black masses in the chest cavity

ELSA
Lungs

CLIVE
No
(indicating lighter
patches )
These are the lungs

ELSA
Tumors

CLIVE
Guess well find out in the autopsy

Elsa stares at the Hybrid not at all happy about the idea
of killing it

CLIVE (CONTD)
Elsa this was never supposed to go
this far It wasnt even supposed
to go full term

ELSA
But it did

CLIVE
We were just going to prove we could
do it That was all

ELSA
So what are you saying Are you
really going to kill it

Clive glances over to the sleeping hybrid eerily human-like

ELSA (CONTD)
You think you can do that

Clives mouth tightens without comment

Elsa pulls him over to the table where her microscope sits
She points to the video tap a microscopic view of rapidly
dividing cells

ELSA (CONTD)
See that It must have developed
the Ambysotma growth gene

CLIVE
Its aging fast
ELSA
Days within a matter of minutes

(beat)
This thing is going to die soon
anyway Well be able to observe
its entire life cycle in compressed
time

(beat)
Well never have an opportunity like
this again

Clive bites his lip Shes playing him perfectly He glances
at the Hybrid

CLIVE
So its dying

ELSA
Shes dying All by herself

Clive looks apprehensive but staring at the creature he
cant quite suppress a powerful fascination

INT MAIN LAB -- DAY

New equipment is being installed for the breakdown and
analysis of chemicals disturbing the work of several of the
LAB STAFF

Dexter swabs samples of Gingers dorsal excretions while
Clive pulls a blood sample The little creature shakes under
the needle

DEXTER
Estrogen levels been low these days
CLIVE
What do you mean these days How
long
DEXTER
Its in the logs Every test every
stat

Dexter hands Clive a thick file

CLIVE
Sorry I Ima little worn out

He leafs absently through stats

DEXTER
I um guess that thing that
experiment youve got going on
Still not ready to talk about it

Clive closes the file and regards his brothers aching
curiosity

CLIVE
I can tell you its big Pretty
big And we need your help

Dexter quickly perks up at the pleasing prospect of
involvement

DEXTER
Sure anything

Clive puts his hand on Dexters shoulder squeezing it
inclusively

CLIVE
This experiment its really
important that it doesnt get

disturbed
(MORE )

CLIVE (CONTD)
We need you to make sure that
nobody I mean nobody gets inside
the containment room

DEXTER
Sure Absolutely Nobody gets in
(hopefully)
Not even
(pointing to himself)

Clive smiles and shakes his head Dexter shrugs off his
disappointment with a grin

CLIVE
Sorry Nobody
INT CONTAINMENT CHAMBER -- DAY

The Hybrid is NOW THE SIZE OF A TODDLER and harnessed by a
three-foot lead to the leg of a floor-bolted workbench

A plastic container has been taped on as a protective cover
for her tail stinger She scratches at it with some
irritation

Clive eyes the tail nervously as he attempts to feed her a
bowl of wet green mush with a turkey-baster

Elsa watches talking into a hand-held voice recorder

ELSA
(into recorder)
Weve got H-50 on a diet of
chlorophyll roughage bean curd
and enriched starch

As quickly as Clive tries to jam the baster into the Hybrids
mouth she either turns her head or spits the food out

ELSA (CONTD)
(into recorder)
She seems resistant to feeding though
her rapid growth should generate a
proportionate appetite

Clive tries to squeeze a little more goo into the Hybrids
stubborn mouth He receives a green blob to the forehead
for his efforts

CLIVE
Were going to have to do this with
a drip feed

ELSA
Shell just rip it out

The Hybrid sniffs the air sensing something Suddenly a
leg lashes out at Elsa with a SHOCKINGLY FAST KICK

Both she and Clive recoil Then they see it The Hybrids
tiny hand-like foot has snatched the box of Nerds from Elsas
lab coat She is gobbling the candy like a starved animal

Elsa watches amazed an idea forming
INT CONTAINMENT CHAMBER -- SOON AFTER

Elsa crumbles several nerds between two spoons then mixes
them into the Hybrids mush

She holds the spoon up to the Hybrids mouth This time
nostrils flair and she happily wolfs the food down

Clive now commandeers the voice recorder

CLIVE
(into recorder)
Tracking her feeding habits weve
determined that the H-50 craves high-
sucrose foodstuffs

Elsa wipes a little goo from the side of the Hybrids mouth
A long tongue darts out precisely cleaning Elsas finger
She gives Elsa what might be considered a smile Elsa smiles
back and continues the feeding

INT NOVAPHORM HEADQUARTERS - BARLOWS OFFICE -- DAY

Clive sits with Barlow in his downtown office Three small
armchairs have been jammed into a corner of the room near
his desk One is empty Clive looks a little ruffled by
stress and bad sleep

BARLOW
Wheres Elsa

CLIVE
At the lab Holding things together

BARLOW
She isnt too happy about the new
directive is she

CLIVE
It was a bit of a shock

BARLOW
I understand

Barlow leans in close as though the walls might be listening

BARLOW (CONTD)
Truth is if we dont start projecting
profits big profits soon
Novaphorms in serious trouble

Clive looks genuinely startled Barlow grabs Clives hand
like a terminal patient imploring his doctor for a cure

BARLOW (CONTD)
Phase 2 is not an option Its all
weve got Youll impress that on
her Clive wont you

CLIVE
Were on side Bill Trust me

Barlow relieved abruptly changes tone to one of chummy
encouragement

BARLOW
Look at it this way Were sparing
you a lot of grief The worlds not
ready to mess with the human animal
(beat)
You know Kwan over at Geneteck

CLIVE
Tim Kwan

BARLOW
(nods )
He stepped over the line Right
into a ten year prison term

Clive takes this in

BARLOW (CONTD)
Genius is punished when its ahead
of the times
(beat)
All through history

--And swallows hard
50 INT CONTAINMENT CHAMBER -- DAY
The Hybrid is a little larger than when we last saw her
Elsa gives her a routine physical examination while speaking

into her voice recorder

Clive sits quietly in the corner flipping through the log
books on Fred and Ginger trying to get up to date

ELSA
(into recorder)
H-50s physiological anomalies
continue to emerge Swelling in the
Latissimus Dorsi and Teris Major and
Minor muscles

Elsa notices pronounced bruising and swelling from the rib
cage along to the back Her expression betrays sympathy but
her voice remains clinical

ELSA (CONTD)
(into recorder)
Its possible that aspects of her
anatomy may be ill-suited to emerging
mutations

Elsa winces at the painfully tender look of the flesh When
she prods the bruises the Hybrid writhes from her touch

ELSA (CONTD)
(into recorder)
The overall structure could become
unstable leading to malignancies
and

Elsa cant finish the sentence

ELSA (CONTD)
Its too soon to make any assumptions

She clicks off her voice recorder and gathers her papers
ELSA (CONTD)
(to Clive)
Youll be alright then
Clive looks up from his work
CLIVE
El you havent taken a break in
days

Elsa kisses Clive on the cheek

ELSA
Call if theres a problem

and heads for the door The Hybrid looks alarmed She
hops after Elsa jerks short when she reaches the end of her
lead Then cries out her alien tones settling into the all
too familiar timber of a human baby

Elsa regards her doing her best to maintain cool composure

ELSA (CONTD)
Ill be back tomorrow

Conflicted she turns to go A SICK TEARING SOUND and a
SCREAM

Clive jumps up as Elsa spins around in time to see

The Hybrids back spasms muscles twist flesh stretches
grotesquely as if something inside were trying to break out

RIIIIP A slender girlish arm erupts from her side Bleeding
and dripping with shreds of skin it lashes out and grips
Elsas leg with two bony fingers and an opposing thumb

CLIVE
Holy fuck

Elsa instinctively yanks her leg but the Hybrid holds on
tight

The creature CRIES OUT LOUDER possibly as much from emotional
heartache as physical pain And another lanky arm bursts
out of the other side of her bruised fleshy back

Clive takes out their cam-corder capturing the whole
incredible event on video

Elsa stares down at the Hybrid freaked-out by the bloody
appendages desperately clawing her pant leg

CLIVE (CONTD)
El careful

But Elsa surrenders to the irresistible need to comfort She
bends into the gooey embrace drawing the hybrid close The
creatures cries trail off into hiccuping breaths of relief

Clives brow furrows from behind the viewfinder reacting to
this blatantly emotional display

INT MUSCLE CAR - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
Elsa gets behind the wheel and inserts her key into the
ignition But she hesitates before turning it staring back

at the entrance to the lab

She bites a nail nervously Then quickly composes herself
and starts the car mumbling reassurances to herself

ELSA
Shell be alright Its fine Shell
be fine

Elsa swings out of the parking space

INT BIRTHING CHAMBER -- NIGHT

The Hybrid is WAILING at the top of her lungs She is
apparently NOT fine

The torn skin on her back has been carefully bandaged with
gauze and tape but she seems emotionally stricken by Elsas
absence

Clive tries to approach imploring her to calm down

CLIVE
Hey its okay Shell be back

The Hybrid continues to wail at full volume

Clive steps forward The Hybrid quickly skitters towards

the corner as far as her rope will let her Her tail flails
back and forth menacingly its plastic bottle clattering on
the floor

CLIVE (CONTD)
Take it easy Cmon Im here

She cranks up her crying another notch

CLIVE (CONTD)
Think of all the new things we can
do now
(smiling)
We can arm wrestle

The Hybrids cry sputters and stalls a moment Clive looks
relieved - hes getting through But she is just filling
her lungs for another even louder EMOTIONAL BLAST

Hands on his ears Clive cant take it He staggers out of
the room

INT NOVAPHORM LABS - LUNCH ROOM -- EVENING

Clive inserts coins into a vending machine relieved to be
momentarily away from the cacophony His coffee comes down
the chute and as he reaches to retrieve it he hears

THE HYBRIDS WAILING faint and distant but unmistakable
Clive shakes his head thinking hes hearing things until
his eyes land on the air duct next to the fridge Her voice

is coming up through the ventilation system

Panicking he scans the room There are a few LAB TECHNICIANS
snacking at the far end who havent yet heard

The Hybrids voice seems to be getting louder still Thinking
quickly Clive fumbles with a radio on top of the fridge

He turns it on to a talk show The creatures voice still
cuts through

Clive spins the dial until he tunes into a LOUD HEAVY METAL
STATION - mid-guitar solo He cranks the volume Her voice
is finally drowned out

He looks back to the Technicians One LONG-HAIRED TECHIE
holds up his fore-finger and pinky (devils horns) as a sign
of appreciation to Clive

Clive forces a smile and returns the gesture
INT CLIVE AND ELSAS APARTMENT - HALL -- NIGHT
Elsa digs musty boxes out of a hallway closet

She pulls out the one she was looking for Its labeled
Private Ellys Stuff in childish scrawl

She opens it with a mixture of excitement and dread Inside
are an assortment of childs toys a ratty STUFFED DOG a
MINIATURE BICYCLE a WOODEN HORSE One toy in particular
draws her attention a BARBIE DOLL circa 1980 Memories
flood

Something else catches her eye She digs in deeper finds a
dog-eared photo Its a picture of a five year old Elsa and
her Mother standing by the family farm - a stern woman with
an arm protectively wrapped around her daughter her long
dark hair sports Elsas single streak of white

Elsa regards it for a long moment But rather than triggering
fond memories the photo only seems to inspire melancholy

INT CONTAINMENT CHAMBER -- DAY

A NEW DAY Elsa checks the bandages at the extraction points
where the Hybrids arms erupted from her back

The creature seems beguiled by these new aspects of her body
She waves and flexes them with delighted bird-like CHORTLES
She reaches out tentatively stroking Elsas curls

ELSA
You like that You like hair
(suddenly remembering)
Oh hey I found some things for
you

Elsa pulls out her box of toys and sets it down between the
Hybrids legs

ELSA (CONTD)
See anything else you like

44

The Hybrid pushes around awkwardly in the box intrigued by
the shapes but is instantly drawn to the Barbie doll She
has some trouble gripping with her new hands so Elsa helps
her wrapping her own hand around the Hybrids fingers
Together they hold Barbie in the air between them

ELSA (CONTD)
(in a breathy Barbie
voice)
Hi there Im Barbie I like cute
guys fast cars and funny little
creatures like you

Elsa slowly lets go of the Hybrids hand pleased to see her
grip the doll on her own

ELSA (CONTD)
She was my secret friend I wasnt
allowed to have her so I had to
keep her hidden
(beat)
Just like you

The Hybrid turns it around clumsily studying it from all
angles She strokes the hair completely entranced

ELSA (CONTD)
Thats right She has hair too

Elsa watches wistfully Theres something a little sad about
this bald creature so fascinated by hair The Hybrids head
begins to bob with fatigue eyes drooping She leans her
forehead on Elsas shoulder

ELSA (CONTD)
Youre tired Thats all right
Well play later

The hybrid nuzzles deeper into Elsas shoulder At first a
little nervous Elsa gathers the creature into her lap and
cradles her The Hybrid instantly begins to relax And
Elsa finds herself rocking her and humming softly If we
listen closely the we might recognize the melody as Under
My Skin

The creatures eyelids droop her neck relaxes Within
moments she is breathing deeply -- asleep

EXT OBSERVATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Unseen by Elsa Clive watches through the one-way mirror

her HUMMING broadcast over the intercom He is clearly
troubled by this tableau

INT NOVAPHORM LABS - CORRIDOR -- DAY

In a private corner Elsa wolfs down NERDS and talks rapidly
riding a sugar-fueled high Clive listens His face betrays

concern

ELSA
I think its a form of
hypometamorphosis Her tissue
liquefies and reforms Thats why
we cant track it with MRI or x-rays
At this point theres no telling
what she might become And its not
just her body Her intelligence is
developing fast She figures things
out

CLIVE
We have to be careful not to project
too much onto her

ELSA
Shes not just a collection of
instincts She thinks

CLIVE
Of course she thinks Dogs think
But

A TECHIE passes They nod greetings pausing their

conversation until hes out of earshot

CLIVE (CONTD)
(quiet)
--But dogs arent capable of complex
associative reasoning

ELSA
Youre wrong She just needs time

Clive watches Elsa carefully measuring her up

CLIVE
You know what we need
ELSA
What
CLIVE

We need to act our age

INT HYPERSPACE -- NIGHT

Clive and Elsa share a booth at the same club where Clive
was shot The air prickles with its usual high-energy
throb Elsa sips from a glass of wine looking restless

Clive taps the BREAKNECK BEAT with his fingernails on the
table grooving to the psychedelic mayhem

CLIVE
Hey come on Lets dance

ELSA
No Thanks I dont feel like it

Clive barrels past his disappointment He reaches into his
pocket and produces Elsas dropper-vial of liquid excitement

CLIVE
I know what you need A little drop
of fun

Elsa shakes her head without apology Clives smile falls

ELSA
Im having fun But you go ahead
Go for it

Clives determination is losing steam He pockets the vial

CLIVE
No Im okay Im fine
(unconvincing)
This is fun

The noise of the club floods into their vacuum of
conversation Eventually Elsa gathers up her purse and
shuffles out of the booth

CLIVE (CONTD)
You all right

ELSA
I want to go I want to go back
(beat)
She shouldnt be left alone

INT OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY

Elsa has let the Hybrid out of containment She is now about
the size of a FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD with fully developed
spindly arms There are a few emerging stands of hair which
only emphasize her baldness

Sitting cross-legged on the floor Elsa watches with delight
as the Hybrid successfully places A SPOON onto a piece of
paper with a drawn outline of a spoon

ELSA
Thats right Spoon
(beat)
Now Dog Do the dog

The Hybrid quickly picks up the tiny STUFFED DOG and places
it onto a sheet of paper with a crudely drawn dog

Elsa claps her hands delighted

ELSA (CONTD)
Thats it Dog Its getting too
easy for you isnt it

The Hybrid cocks her head expectantly Elsa spills several
Nerds into the creatures hand which she quickly scarfs

ELSA (CONTD)
You could do this all day

Elsa scuffles over to the table and pulls down a large box

ELSA (CONTD)
Lets try something different

She pulls a Deluxe-Edition Scrabble game from its box and
places the board between them Its the kind with a lazy-
Susan base and raised ridges to line up the letters

Elsa spills the bag of letters onto the floor and quickly
rummages for the tiles she wants She arranges the letters
P-E-N onto the board then pivots it so the word appears
upright to the Hybrid

She holds up a PEN then points to the letters

ELSA (CONTD)
P-E-N That says PEN PEN

She puts down the pen and points to the word

ELSA (CONTD)
Whats that Show me Show me the
pen

The Hybrid just stares at her blankly Elsa arranges the
letters of her own name E-L-S-A

ELSA (CONTD)
Thats ELSA Me
(tapping her chest)
Im Elsa Elsa

The Hybrids face is a blank slate of incomprehension Elsa
points back to the first word and holds up the ballpoint

ELSA (CONTD)
PEN This is a PEN
(tapping her chest)
ELSA Im Elsa Pen Elsa

Elsa searches the Hybrids face desperate to detect the
slightest sign of association Nothing

Elsa notices the Hybrids gaze is fixated on the box of Nerds
in her breast pocket She spills a couple into her palm --
incentive The Hybrids eyes dart her mouth opens slightly

Holding the Nerds hostage in her palm Elsa points again at
the word PEN

ELSA (CONTD)
Whats that PEN
(beat)
Wheres the pen

Still nothing Not a glimmer Elsa pops the Nerds into her
own mouth with a sigh then tips the board spilling the
letters to the floor She sees palpable disappointment in
the Hybrids eyes -- reacting to the lost reward

Elsa gets another idea She rifles through the tiles
plucking up five letters to spell the word N-E-R-D-S

She rotates the board then holds up the box of candy where
the same letters are clearly marked on the label NERDS

The Hybrids eyes flit quickly from the Nerds to the Scrabble
board then back to the Nerds Elsa smiles Somethings
starting to click

ELSA (CONTD)
Nerds Cmon You know what Nerds
are

The Hybrid reaches out a spindly hand to touch the tiles
her eyes skipping to the actual package of candy

ELSA (CONTD)
Thats right Theyre the same
NERDS

The Hybrid abruptly pops the letter S into her mouth chews
and quickly swallows it Elsa gasps The Hybrid makes a
sour expression as though shed been tricked

Elsas momentary dismay is replaced by a triumphant grin

ELSA (CONTD)
You did it You made a connection
Good girl

Elsa spills some real Nerds onto the game board and the Hybrid
quickly gobbles them up The door opens behind Elsa She
spins quickly to greet Clive The Hybrid cowers at his
arrival

ELSA (CONTD)
She did it

CLIVE
Whats going on

ELSA
She can associate

CLIVE
(annoyed)
What is she doing in this room You
cant let her out

ELSA
Whats the problem

CLIVE
Specimens need to be contained

ELSA
Dont call her that

CLIVE
What are we supposed to call her

Elsa quickly scans the room looking for a name On the
Scrabble board are the remaining four (un-eaten) tiles
spelling NERD Of course they are upside-down to Elsa

ELSA
DREN Her name is Dren

DREN the Hybrid scuttles into the corner Clive is suddenly
furious

CLIVE
Youre talking like Youre treating
her like shes a
(catching himself)
A pet

ELSA
Im compiling a developmental profile
She needs more stimulation than that
room

CLIVE
Well were screwed now Theyre
renovating this entire wing
Tomorrow So what the hell are we
going to do about that

Drens eyes narrow at his raised voice Elsa now angry
herself yanks an equipment cart from the side of the room

ELSA
Alright so well move her Well
put her in the storage room
downstairs Nobody goes down there

CLIVE
What are we doing Why are we taking
all these risks

Elsa yanks equipment from the lower shelves of the cart

ELSA
When the hell did you get so fucking
scared of everything

Something triggers in Clive He takes three furious steps
into Elsas face Yelling now Loudly

CLIVE
WHEN THE FUCK DID YOU STOP BEING A
SCIENTIST

Dren flings herself across the room and lands squarely on
Clive He falls backwards hitting the floor hard Drens
tail waves wildly flinging off the protective cover

The poison spike withdraws from its fleshy sheath poised to
sting

ELSA
NO STOP

Dren freezes then turns her head to Elsa

ELSA (CONTD)
(cool in command)
Go to your place

Dren eyes Clive once more before obediently skulking back
into her corner Clive sits up breathing heavily still a
little afraid

ELSA (CONTD)
Its okay She wont hurt you

She helps Clive up

ELSA (CONTD)
I know we have a situation But we
just have to deal with it

CLIVE
(struggling to contain
himself )
A situation She could have killed
me

Clive and Dren eye each other warily Elsa loads a cardboard
box into the lower portion of the cart

ELSA
Dont be melodramatic Lets just
solve this

CLIVE
Jesus fucking Christ

INT CORRIDOR -- DAY

Elsa and Clive wheel the cart with equipment on top A box
labelled Sequence Driver rests beneath The top shifts
Drens eyes peer out Elsa pushes her gently back down

ELSA
Stay inside Dren

Clive nervously glances around the corner Coast is clear

CLIVE
She okay

ELSA
Scared Its all right

They truck the cart around the corner and manage to get to
the freight elevator undetected Elsa hits the down button
The elevator rises up from the basement at a snails pace

Finally the doors open revealing Dexter who looks
startled to see them

DEXTER
Wow I dont think Ive seen the
two of you together in weeks

ELSA
Hey Dex

Dexters eyes land on the EEG machine on top of the cart
with a variety of other devices

DEXTER
Where are you going with that

CLIVE
Storage Its not working We need
to order a new

DEXTER
(confused)
What do you mean not working I had
it hooked up to Fred yesterday

Clive isnt sure what to say Dexter searches their faces

DEXTER (CONTD)
Whats going on

THE CLACKING OF MENS SHOES Clive looks over his shoulder
and sees Barlow striding down the hall

CLIVE
Shit

Elsa flicks hair from her face trying to play it cool
Clive swallows hard

BARLOW
Ive been looking for you two
everywhere

CLIVE
Whazup

Barlow glances at the cart of equipment

BARLOW
Whats all this

CLIVE
Just some junk were trashing

Barlow is suddenly curious He fingers the EEG machine on
the top of the cart

BARLOW
Pretty state-of-the-art junk What
else are you

To Clive and Elsas horror Barlow quickly bends down to the
bottom of the cart and opens the box containing Dren Barlow
tips the box to reveal that the its empty - Dren is gone
Clive scans the hallway Nothing

They catch each others eye bewildered Elsa bucks up

ELSA
What can we do for you Bill

Barlow quickly loses interest in the equipment

BARLOW
Listen Great news Were going to
present Fred and Ginger at the annual
shareholders meeting

Clive and Elsa are completely distracted scanning for some
sign of missing Dren

ELSA
Shareholders

BARLOW
We impress them with the H-40s
Novaphorm stock will go through the
roof

CLIVE
I dunno Bill were pretty busy

The elevator doors slide closed Elsa quickly slaps the

down button again they slide back open She enters the
elevator half expecting to find Dren in there The elevators
empty She remains inside holding the door with her hand

BARLOW
I thought youd be excited Dont
you wanna show them off

Clive is anxious to get rid of Barlow

CLIVE
Yeah I guess

He looks nervously to Elsa who is staring oddly at Dexter

BARLOW
Alright then Lets meet Ive got
to prepare a budget

Something drips on Barlows shoulder He doesnt notice

Clive follows Elsas eyes to Dexter His mortified gaze is
fixated on the ceiling where Dren is wedged like a tree
toad in the corner above Barlow Her tail swings back and
forth ready to pounce Clive stifles his shock

Barlow takes one last look at the EEG machine

BARLOW (CONTD)
You sure we cant fix it Sometimes
you guys act like theres money coming
out of

Suddenly Dexter speaks up a hair too loudly

DEXTER
Its fried Totally fucked We
need a new one Right away

Barlows eyebrows raise at Dexters outburst Over his
shoulder Elsa peels Dren off the wall and swings her into
the elevator

Dexter takes Barlow by the arm and gently guides him away
from the elevator

DEXTER (CONTD)
Listen Bill Ive got some
requisition forms on my desk If
you can push the purchase through

Dexter hazards a glimpse back at Clive who tosses back a
quick look of appreciation and then shoves the cart into
the elevator Barlow calls after them as the doors close

BARLOW
Call me

Barlow feels the wetness on his shoulder Brings his fingers
to his nose sniffs them sensing something is up but unable
to pin down exactly what it is

INT DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR -- DAY

Elsa and Clive roll the cart quickly up to the door of the
storage room

ELSA
God I hate that guy

CLIVE
Why because he plays by the rules

ELSA
Because he loves them

Elsa quickly keys open the door and pushes the cart inside
INT STORAGE ROOM -- DAY

The inside of the storage room is lined with shelves
cluttered with old boxes obsolete equipment and forgotten
cleaning products At the far end theres plumbing and a
huge industrial sink

Stepping inside propels a cloud of dust into the air

CLIVE
(furious )
You know sticking to a few fucking
rules isnt always such a bad idea

Elsa draws Dren from below the cart and into her arms looking
a little queasy Clive steps back wary

ELSA
Nobodys going to care about a few
rules After they see what weve
made

CLIVE
See what weve made Nobody can see
what weve made

ELSA
Once they see Ginger and Fred dont
you think the worlds going to want
to know whats next

She holds Drens face next to her own as though this were
all she needed to make her case to the world

ELSA (CONTD)
Do you think they can look at this
face And see anything less than
a miracle

Clives jaw hangs open stunned at Elsas naivete

And as if on cue Dren pukes on Elsas shoulder then buries
her head miserably in Elsas chest

ELSA (CONTD)
Oh oh no Oh Sweetie youre
sick

Clive shakes his head astounded The whole thing is getting
to be too much Elsa puts her wrist to Drens forehead

ELSA (CONTD)
Clive shes really hot

CLIVE
Ive got to talk to Dexter

He leaves disgusted Elsa hardly notices

INT NOVAPHORM LABS - LUNCH ROOM -- DAY

Clive sits with Dexter by the window The silence between
them is so intense the hum of the Coke machine sounds like
a plane landing

Finally Clive cant take it any longer

CLIVE
Go ahead Say what youre thinking

DEXTER
What Im thinking What were you
thinking

CLIVE

It was kind of an accident

DEXTER
(incredulous)
That kind of an accident takes a
hundred million years Unless
somebody very smart does it on
purpose

CLIVE
Look I know its crazy
(beat)
But I need your support on this I
need your help

Dexter looks at Clive with a mixture of reluctant loyalty
and profound disappointment

DEXTER
Ive got a wife and three kids
What happens to them if I go to
prison For what you two have done

Clive squirms in his chair

DEXTER (CONTD)
Did you ever think about that
(beat)
Did you think at all Or did you
just do what she wanted

CLIVE
(face reddening)
It wasnt like that

DEXTER
You could have stopped it At any
time you could have said no to her

Clive cant quite muster a retort

DEXTER (CONTD)
Try it some time

With that Dexter bustles out of the room leaving his brother
to quietly simmer alone

INT STORAGE ROOM -- NIGHT

Its night now Clive has accomplished a lot with the room
piling all the unwanted boxes to one side He finishes
mopping the floor while Elsa dotes over sick Dren She pulls
a thermometer from Drens mouth and studies it

ELSA
One hundred and five This is
serious
CLIVE
How do we know with her

ELSA
(frantic)
I know We have to do something

CLIVE
What What are we supposed to do

Dren lets out a TRILLING GROAN that ends with a choke and
more vomit Elsa rushes over to wipe her mouth

ELSA
We have to take her somewhere

CLIVE
Thats crazy

ELSA
(almost crying)
THEN DO SOMETHING

Clive stares down at Dren who is quickly fading He scans
the storage room desperately

CLIVE
Were bio-chemists We can handle
this

ELSA

How Fuck HOW

Clive turns to the industrial sink and runs the faucet

CLIVE

What do you do with high fever
ELSA

Cold bath
CLIVE

All right Lets do it
MOMENTS LATER
The sink is almost full
Drens condition is considerably worse Her nose is
completely clogged throat swollen she can hardly breathe

Clive turns off the faucet

ELSA
Hurry

With her legs folded under her Clive and Elsa manage to
squeeze Dren into the sink sideways

She squirms slightly at the shock of cold water but hasnt
the strength to resist

ELSA (CONTD)
Its okay honey Its okay

Drens breathing is getting even more shallow Elsa tries
to hold her head up to facilitate the flow of oxygen Its
no good

ELSA (CONTD)
She cant breath Her passages are
closing Do something

CLIVE
What What

ELSA
I DONT KNOW

Drens thrashes in the water as she fights for air

CLIVE
Tracheotomy

ELSA
With what

CLIVE
In the lab

ELSA

Theres no time

Clive gives Elsa a lost defeated look like this was
inevitable He shakes his head Frustration rising
Suddenly he grabs Dren by the head and pushes her face under
water Elsa SCREAMS

ELSA (CONTD)
Clive Stop it

She pulls at his arms Smashes at his shoulder Dren with
the little strength she has left squirms for her life

CLIVE
GET OFF ME Enough

ELSA
Youre killing her Let her go
(shrieking)
STOP IT

She continues to fight and claw at Clive He hangs on
elbowing her away He leans into the sink determined
Elsa watches like we watch our own nightmares

BUBBLES break to the surface First softly Then building
Bubbles in rhythmic regularity Elsas face lights up
astounded Its Dren Breathing Underwater

Clives ferocity breaks into relief and astonishment He
laughs Elsa stares down holding her hair awe-struck

ELSA (CONTD)
Shes breathing

DREN has by-passed her clogged mouth and nose and is breathing
through gills which have emerged under her jaw-line Clive
relaxes his arms Dren has ceased struggling He simply
holds her gently under the surface

LATER

Dren is out of the sink looking very much revived as Elsa
pats her down with a towel

CLIVE
Now we know what those blobs are
Amphibious lungs

ELSA
You saved her My God
(ecstatic)
How did you know

Clive responds with an awkward shrug

ELSA (CONTD)
You did know right

Theres a moment Just the slightest instant of hesitation

CLIVE
Yeah Of course

Elsa relaxes her doubt easily evaporating Then Clive faces
her deadly serious

CLIVE (CONTD)
We cant fuck around anymore We
have to clean this place up Make
it safe

Elsa smiles and nods relieved to finally have him on-side
INT STORAGE ROOM - VIDEO MONTAGE

We watch a montage of video footage of Dren taking us through
her rapid physical development from the body of a SEVEN YEAR-
OLD GIRL to that of an adolescent

The storage room has now taken on the character of a family
living room

Dren is dressed for the first time in a HOSPITAL GOWN Little
girls barrettes stuck to her tufts of hair humanize her
just enough to really emphasize her strangeness

ELSA (0S)
In the first three months since her
birth Dren the worlds first human-
animal chimera has far outstripped
our expectations

Clive enters the FRAME with a cake At first Dren shrinks
from the three flickering birthday candles But with Clives
instruction she quickly learns to blow them out She flashes
a gap-toothed smile

ELSA (0S) (CONTD)
While genetically she follows the
same template as our H-40 hybrids
the added human element appears to
be taking a dominant role

Dren now looks to be perhaps ELEVEN and increasingly girl-
like Hair is beginning to thicken The seam-like scar
down her face and body is less prominent

Elsa conducts Dren who sways and whistles in odd tones along
to a Big Band rendition of Under My Skin while THE VIDEO
CAMERA MOVES AROUND HER BODY Clive lifts her arms for a
closer view There is a strange muscle system running under
them and joining to the skin of her back

CLIVE (0S)
The muscular structures extending
from the trapezius to the deltoideus
and ending at the brachialis are
unusual their function unclear

Finally we see what looks like a FULL-GROWN TEENAGE GIRL in
an old-fashioned bathtub Her body is beginning to look more
like that of a young woman in puberty Hips curved A trace
of breasts noticeable Her eyes have migrated closer to the
front of her head Though still alien-looking her features
have become quite sculpted and lovely

CLIVE (0S) (CONTD)
We do know she has developed a
secondary amphibian respiratory
system and becomes ill if out of
water too long

Elsa instructs as Dren arranges scrabble tiles which float
on the surface of the water to spell simple words Nerds
continue to be an incentive

ELSA (0S)
Intelligence and communication skills
continue to improve Still her
mind remains her greatest mystery

Dren sinks below the surface disappearing from the CAMERAS
VIEW

END MONTAGE
INT STORAGE ROOM -- NIGHT

Clive puts down the camcorder as Elsa dims the light near
Dren who is tucking under the covers post-bath

Elsa begins to step away when Dren bolts upright her arms
reaching out clearly agitated

ELSA
Whats wrong What is it honey

Dren quickly shuffles through her collection of scrabble
tiles on the night table She begins to arrange letters
K - I - S Elsa nearly melts

ELSA (CONTD)
Oh Im sorry Dren I forgot

She leans over and gives Dren a kiss on each cheek and one
on the forehead The Hybrids tension instantly vaporizes
In another instant shes asleep her face at peace

Elsa draws a curtain suspended from the ceiling and turns to
Clive with a whisper

ELSA (CONTD)
Shes had a big day

Together they collapse onto the cushions of an old couch

Elsa looks exhausted With her skirt well up above her knees
Clive finds himself admiring her legs

CLIVE
Its been a long time

His hand rides up her leg

ELSA
Oh God I didnt even notice
(beat)
Is that what happens

CLIVE
To couples when they

ELSA
When they work too hard

That wasnt quite what Clive meant but he nods anyway

CLIVE
Cmere

ELSA
What here

CLIVE

Just get over here

He pulls Elsa into his lap and kisses her neck Elsa slings
her legs over Clive lifting her skirt straddling him while
they kiss deeply mouths open They start to grind and groan

Elsa fumbles under her skirt and we hear the sounds of CLIVES
ZIPPER and TEARING PANTYHOSE Surprised but excited Clive
disengages from their kiss to whisper in her ear

CLIVE (CONTD)
Hey we dont have any

Elsa just grabs his hand and mashes it into her breasts
They are already fucking

ELSA
Whats the worst that could happen

Clive is about to put a stop to their passion when something
catches his eye A shimmer He pushes Elsas hair out of
his face

He sees her Dren Peering through the curtains Her
excited breathing gives her away Oblivious Elsa continues
to ride him her arousal building

The moment is surreal Clive continues to watch Dren
watching He says nothing Sexual momentum builds
Strangeness

JOAN (VO)
Here is a couple each so unlike
anything weve seen before

Clives face contorts into orgasm -- a release of raw physical
pleasure
EXT CONVENTION CENTER -- NIGHT

Clive is GRINNING WIDELY his eyes alight with the excitement
of the evening

He and Elsa formally dressed hold hands walking
ceremoniously up the stairs to a large CONVENTION CENTER -
site of the annual Novaphorm shareholders meeting

A large banner sports Novaphorms logo and the slogan
DESIGNING A BETTER TODAY

JOAN (VO)
-They are drawn together by the
simple fact that there is nobody
else quite like them

On either side of the stairs reporters photographers and
video crews jostle for position elbow-to-elbow with
protesters from all walks of life - religious and secular

As the protesters scream their epitaphs and warnings shake
their signs and bump up against a HEAVY SECURITY PRESENCE
Clive and Elsa seem not to notice This is their proudest
night Arm-in-arm they stride into sciences brightest
spotlight

INT CONVENTION CENTER - AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT

Joan stands at a podium addressing an auditorium packed to
the rafters with investors We realize now that her speech
is not about Elsa and Clive after all but about Ginger
and Fred who are on stage in clear plexi-glass cages

JOAN
That they are completely unique in
this world is more than an act of
fate More than just luck It is
by design

As Joans presentation continues the cages slowly roll
towards each other from opposing ends of the stage

JOAN (CONTD)
Now let me present to you the minds

behind the design splice-masters
extraordinaire Clive Nicoli and
Elsa Kast

With a LOUD FANFARE Clive and Elsa take to the stage
Clearly excited caught up in the energy of the moment they
wave to the cheering crowd Joan steps aside so they can
huddle over the podium microphone

CLIVE
Theres been a lot of talk tonight
about advancements in multi-species
morphogens Weve talked about our
new protein-based compounds Disease-
fighting agents for livestock

Behind him a slide-show rifles through the development of
Ginger and Fred at the microscopic level Barlow and Dexter
watch from the wings nervous and proud The Lab Techies are
fanned out behind them

In the audience front row sit Melinda and THE PHOTOGRAPHER
from Wired magazine

Ginger and Freds cages continue to roll towards center-stage
Elsa leans into the mic

ELSA

And thats all very exciting for
everyone at Novaphorm

(beat)
But lets be honest Whats exciting
for you people here tonight is seeing
these two creatures Alive In the
flesh

PERFECTLY ON CUE the cages align The walls separating
them sink away Ginger and Fred are free to mingle ina
single double-sized cage

As each steps forward a little disoriented by the bright
lights there is a COMMUNAL GASP from the audience

ELSA (CONTD)
They are state of the art designer
organisms

Ginger and Fred approach each other sniffing and aroused
like they have a hundred times before Their mutual
excitement is so focused they become oblivious to their
surroundings

ELSA (CONTD)
Mans newest and best friend

The audience getting their first clear view of the Hybrids
in motion are awed and silent A video projector splashes
live close-ups on the wall behind them

ELSA (CONTD)
-Here to point the way to a
better

The Hybrids approach includes the usual PURRING RUMBLE
Then an agitated raising of hackles Gingers mouth opens
a string of drool dropping to the floor

ELSA (CONTD)
-Today

Ginger GROWLS Clive suddenly looks worried He glances to
Elsa who shakes her head confused just as

GINGER LEAPS ON FRED The two of them fly into a vicious
fight Joan staggers back from the cage Barlow runs on-
stage from the wings

The Hybrids are locked in a SNARLING SCREECHING battle to
the death THEY TEAR AT EACH OTHER WITH TEETH AND CLAWS
LIKE RABID DOGS Blood and bits of flesh splatter the glass

Dexter and several lab techs rush to help but are powerless
to stop the carnage The savage fight continues until the
hybrids are hidden from view behind bloody glass

A breathless moment of quiet

THE SOUNDS RESUME full force as the cages buckle and then
shatter The frenzied and mangled forms of Ginger and Fred
tumble out They roll across the stage then fall off into
the audience

SCREAMS and PANDEMONIUM Melinda and The Photographer leap
to their feet just in time to catch a splash of blood across
their faces and the camera lens

Within moments Ginger then Fred collapse into puddles of
blood and torn flesh

Clive Elsa Dexter and Barlow all stand speechless before
the mound of gore that was their scientific triumph The
entire spectacle is projected in grotesque detail on a twenty
foot screen behind them

Joan stares hypnotically at the video enlargement of Gingers
oozing innards

INT NOVAPHORM HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

There is a deathly silence in the room as Joan Barlow Clive
and Elsa face-off around an oversized conference table

What is clear is that the Hybrid has hit the fan Elsas
white blouse is spattered with blood Joan has made a point
of removing her shoes Clives dress pants are stained from
the cuffs to the knees

Eventually Barlow feels compelled to pipe up

BARLOW
I think we have to agree that this
is a setback in terms of

JOAN
Its a fucking disaster

ELSA
Theyve never exhibited aggression
in the past

JOAN
Well they did tonight Why

Clive and Elsa exchange glances each hoping the other will
do the explaining

JOAN (CONTD)
(furious )
What HAPPENED

CLIVE
Well we havent had much time to
examine the remains but It seems
that Ginger has somehow undergone
certain um

ELSA

Hormonal changes

JOAN
Hormonal changes

ELSA
She turned into a male

Joan and Barlow looks stunned
BARLOW

Just like that Changed sex How
could this happen

CLIVE
(swallowing hard)
We really dont know But clearly
two males caged together and

stressed

Joan carefully reads Clive and Elsa as though they might be
putting her on

JOAN
So your first surviving living hybrid
changes sex
(beat)
And you didnt notice How is that
possible

No answer Clive and Elsa look rightly chastised
ELSA
We can recreate them Theres no
reason not to start over
Joan slams the desk furious
JOAN

No more monsters
(MORE )
JOAN (CONTD)
(beat)
We dont have time for that We
need the gene that produces CD-356
And we need it immediately

CLIVE
How are we supposed derive protein
generations from dead specimens

JOAN
Surely youre farther along than
that

ELSA

Synthesizing the protein hasnt been
as easy as wed hoped

JOAN
(angry)
Then youre not allocating your
resources effectively

Barlow clears his throat

BARLOW
We still have a lot of material to
work with
(to Joan)
I can put the Chem-tel team on it

Clive and Elsa look to Barlow betrayed At their lowest
moment hes clearly seizing the day

ELSA
(outraged)
This is our project We can handle
it
JOAN

Apparently you cannot

BARLOW
Let me do this We can still make
the deadline

JOAN
(to Barlow)
Done Whatever you need Im making
you hands-on in charge of this
(to Clive and Elsa)
I want that protein synthesized in
two weeks Do you understand

Clive and Elsa respond with mute compliance

INT MAIN LAB -- DAY

The gestation cell is being dismantled and carried out of
the birthing room in pieces Barlow leads a SMALL ARMY OF
INVADING SCIENTISTS in gutting the lab They work with
aggressive efficiency and little regard for Clive and Elsas
staff who are left cowering on the sidelines

INT STORAGE ROOM -- DAY

Clive Elsa and Dexter confer in the storage room Clive
nervously paces back and forth while Elsa sits in the corner
with Dren keeping her calm in the presence of this newcomer

Dexter cant help staring at Drens strangeness

DEXTER
You have to get it out of here

CLIVE
And take her where

DEXTER
Anywhere Barlows taking over every
inch of this place Hell find it

CLIVE
What are we gonna do We need
someplace away from everything
DEXTER

(genuinely confused)
What am I not getting here Whatd
you expect when you made it

(beat)
Didnt you have a plan

Clive suddenly turns on his brother

CLIVE
We wouldnt be in this mess if youd
been paying enough attention to
observe a fucking gender change

DEXTER
(incredulous)
Where were you Maestro I was
playing catch up with of all the
work you werent doing

Tempers are really rising Elsa suddenly speaks up ina
barely audible voice

ELSA
I know a place

CLIVE
What

Elsa looks up dredging the words from a place of dread

ELSA
(numb)
I know a place we can take her

INT LOADING DOCK -- NIGHT

Clive and Elsa stand on the platform of the loading dock as
Dexter slowly backs a VAN towards them leaning out the driver-
side window We can see from beyond the garage door that

its late night outside

Elsa holds a protective arm around Dren Clive steadies the
rolling cart loaded with equipment and supplies at the
edge of the platform

CLIVE
All these years youve owned this
farm And you never mentioned it

Elsa looks troubled and remote

ELSA
You knew I grew up on a farm

CLIVE
I didnt know you still had it

ELSA
Its not my farm It was hers

CLIVE
But shes dead

ELSA
Sos the farm

INTEXT VAN -- TRAVELING -- NIGHT
Clive and Elsa drive past the city limits In the back
seen between their bucket seats is Dren peering out

nervously from under a blanket

ELSA
I swore Id never go back

Clive glances over at Elsa slowly putting the pieces
together

CLIVE
So it wasnt all Norman Rockwell

ELSA
My mother had problems After my
father died I became her everything

CLIVE
Sounds like a lot of mothers

ELSA
One time I made her a birthday card
I forgot to write I love you
For that she locked me in my room
for a week Without food or water

Clive glances over horrified seeing Elsa in a new light
Her quirks suddenly taking on new significance

CLIVE
(sympathetic)
I cant believe you never told me
this before

ELSA
I just wanted to forget about it

Dren presses herself against the side of Elsas car seat
Elsa rubs Drens hand where it grips the upholstery

ELSA (CONTD)
When I finally left she refused to
touch my room She said Id come
back one day
(beat)
I guess she was right

EXT ABANDONED FARM -- NIGHT

A clapboard farmhouse rests some twenty yards from stables
and a Quonset hut of corrugated iron -- A PASTEURIZATION
BARN They are isolated and ominous against the night sky

The van backs up to the Barn casting it in the amber glow of
tail lights Clive gets out and unlocks a large sliding
door Its mouth gapes open the interior too dark to see
inside

Elsa comes around to the rear of the van and opens the back

Dren cowers within Elsa holds out her arms but Dren scuttles
deeper inside

ELSA
Its okay honey Nothing to be
afraid of

Elsa climbs into the van and takes Dren by the hand

ELSA (CONTD)
Come on This is your new home

Elsa is able to lead Dren by the wrist despite her frightened
resistance She drops to the ground and pulls Dren out
hands under her armpits

Drens eyes widen with surprise at the moist cushy sensation
of grass and earth

Clive and Elsa each take a firm grip on Drens arms and walk
her towards the barn

Drens behavior begins to change Her eyes squint to pluck
a million sights from the moonlit night trees grass stars
She arches her back so that her nostrils can sort through a
dazzling array of smells Her ears tune into exotic sounds
Curiosity and excitement rapidly eclipse her fear

Suddenly Dren wrenches herself from Clive and Elsas
clutches Spinning out of their grip she takes off into

the night

ELSA (CONTD)
Dren

Within moments she has disappeared across the field and
into the abutting forest

Clive and Elsa just stare after her shocked at the force of
her escape

EXT FOREST -- NIGHT

Cries of Dren fill the night air as Clive and Elsa wade
through undergrowth and thick brush with flashlights

CLIVE
This is the disaster everyone warns
about A new species set loose in
the world

ELSA
Dont panic She wont leave us

CLIVE
She just did

ELSA
She wont go far Well find her

They hear a RUSTLING up ahead Elsa gestures for Clive to
hush as she pushes through to a small clearing

And there is Dren clearly recognizable from behind lit by
hazy moonlight Her hunched body is shuddering perhaps
crying Elsa aims the flashlight at her

ELSA (CONTD)
Dren Dren honey

Dren spins her whole body around She hasnt been crying --
shes been eating The carcass of a dead raccoon is torn
open in her hands Her mouth and chin are covered in blood

Elsa gasps Drens eyes are alight her crimson mouth crooked
into a satisfied grin A look-what-I-found childish
innocence

ELSA (CONTD)
Oh Dren

INT PASTEURIZATION BARN -- NIGHT

Elsa locks the door from the inside and loops the key chain
over her head like a necklace She turns to Dren who is
hyper panting and flitting her attention around her new
surroundings

ELSA
Dren listen to me You must never
never run off like that again

Dren locks eyes with Elsa her panting suddenly stopping

ELSA (CONTD)
That was bad You understand Bad
Dren

Dren reacts to Elsas harsh tone Her brow furrows lip
curls into a hurt expression Elsa notices Clive watching
her a little surprised at her severity

Elsa draws Dren close to her holds her tight

ELSA (CONTD)
Im sorry honey Im not mad at
you I was just worried

CLIVE
(trying to lighten
the mood)
Well it aint the Taj Mahal but
this place is going to clean up great

Clive climbs up a small step ladder and pulls out a garden
hose from a large stainless steel tank filled with water

The tank formerly for pasteurizing milk is a perfect vessel
for Drens water time

In fact the sterile requirements of milk processing are
surprisingly close to those of a laboratory

CLIVE (CONTD)
You like it Dren

Dren seems less enthusiastic Elsa wets a cloth with the
hose and gently washes the dried raccoon blood off from her
mouth But Dren resists

ELSA
Honey please

Dren tears away from Elsa

ELSA (CONTD)
Dren

She skitters across the floor and up Clives step ladder
almost knocking him down She propels herself bloody hospital
gown and all into the half-filled tank of water She curls
up in a submerged sulk The little hair she has floats like
sea-grass

Clive steps down from the ladder and pulls Elsa close

ELSA (CONTD)
Why is she acting like this

CLIVE
Shes just upset Everythings new
Give her time Shell be fine

EXT BARN -- NIGHT

Clive and Elsa tip-toe away from Dren sleeping soundly under
a blanket on an inflated mattress

They carefully shut the door locking Dren inside the Barn
EXT FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

It has the dark foreboding quality of any building that
hasnt been entered in years They reach the front porch
Holding a FLASHLIGHT with one hand Clive unlocks the door
with the other Elsa braces herself

CLIVE
You okay

Elsa bucks up and steps forward

ELSA
Yeah Of course Its just a house

She shoves open the door with a LOUD CREAK - like a mothers
scream

INT FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
Clive snaps on the lights though many light bulbs are dead

The place is cobwebbed and dusty but otherwise surprisingly
tidy and spare

Theres a potbellied stove in the middle of the common room
an open kitchen and a series of bedroom doors along the back

INT FARMHOUSE -- ELSAS CHILDHOOD BEDROOM -- NIGHT
The door to Elsas old bedroom swings open Clive peers in
at a room devoid of any furnishings or decor A single twin
mattress sits alone in the middle of the floor
Elsa hides a shudder
CLIVE
I thought you said your mother kept
your room exactly like it was

Elsas mouth tightens as she turns away

ELSA
She did

EXT FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

A view of the farm seen from a distance van barn farmhouse
The single light in the house turns off

INT SECURITY ENTRANCE LAB -- MORNING

Clive approaches the security entrance Dreadlocked-Yuji

has been replaced by an anonymous spit-polished SECURITY
GUARD

INT LAB -- MORNING

Clive enters the remodeled lab walking down a long line of
identical evenly spaced work cubicles As he passes the
faces of his co-workers stare out mournfully from their boxes
Like prisoners of war observing their conquered leader in
chains

With a sigh Clive settles into his own cubical Just another
employee

The first thing he sees is Barlows head over the partition

BARLOW
Wheres Elsa

CLIVE
Not feeling well

BARLOW
Shes not in

CLIVE
Shes sick

Barlows lips tighten

BARLOW
Youve got to be fucking kidding me

CLIVE
People get sick It happens

BARLOW
You know a lot of people would just
suck it in Rise to the occasion
(beat)
You guys are not some special case
Not any more

Barlow storms off Clive is left to stare at the carpet-like
containment of his workstation

EXT ABANDONED DAIRY FARM - GRAVEYARD -- DAY

A small family graveyard behind the farmhouse Elsa stands
over a HEADSTONE engraved with HENDRIKA KAST 1948 - 1996

We can read nothing in her face Not hate nor love remorse
nor resentment She just stares at the grave as if to verify
beyond any doubt that the woman remains dead

INT PASTEURIZATION BARN -- DAY

The interior has been enhanced with furniture from the
farmhouse as well as some makeshift lab equipment Left
alone Dren roams the perimeter clutching her Barbie Her
head cocks towards the rafters letting out an oddly
beautiful but MOURNFUL SONG

Dren stops by a VANITY MIRROR set up at a small table She
strokes the dolls hair Runs a finger along its neck and
pulls off the dress

She compares it to her own reflection Her thin patchy
hair The strange protrusions along her back and arms The
alien-looking legs and undeveloped chest The deep vertical
seam down her face and body

The contrast to Barbie enrages her She SMASHES THE DOLL
INTO THE MIRROR Shards TINKLE away

Dren lines up the Barbie so that its face and body are
bisected by a long vertical crack Barbie still looks
impossibly beautiful Dren throws the doll across the room
Then kicks a chair into the base of the water tank

A MEWING SOUND from behind the tank
Curious Dren creeps around and discovers a mottled small

cat has somehow managed to sneak into the barn It MEOWS at
her looking lost hungry and afraid

Dren cocks her head then with frightening speed snatches it
up We are instantly reminded of the raccoons fate But
Dren does not attack Instead she strokes the animal with
one hand fascinated by the texture of its fur

Dren carries it with her to a workbench at the furthest corner
of the barn She pulls aside a plastic sheet and hides
herself and the cat in the vacant storage space beneath

INSIDE DRENS SPACE

She curls up petting the cat with a kind of tender gratitude
Something uglier than her

EXT FARM -- NIGHT

Two vehicles pull up in front of the farmhouse Clive slides
down from the drivers side of the van Elsa issues from
their vintage hotrod

Together they unload boxes of equipment and supplies from
the back of the van

INT BARN -- EVENING

Elsa Clive and Dren sit at a small folding table Elsa has
trouble getting Dren to eat Impatiently she pushes a bowl
of green muck towards Dren Dren shoves it back

ELSA
Honey please Not today Eat your
dinner

Elsa scoops a spoonful of gruel to Drens mouth but she
turns her head Clive looks up from some notes

CLIVE
She doesnt like it Maybe shed
prefer meat

ELSA
(snapping)
She doesnt eat meat

CLIVE
Is raccoon considered a vegetable

ELSA
That was just an accident
(to Dren)
Cmon honey Eat your food you
know youre hungry

Dren refuses

ELSA (CONTD)
What is it Whats the matter

Dren snatches the bag of scrabble tiles from the bench beside
her She frantically sifts through the letters tossing the
ones she needs onto the table randomly a T then a D and
an I

Having identified the letters she wants Dren quickly arranges
them into a word T-E-D-I-O-U-S

ELSA (CONTD)
TEDIOUS
(to Clive)
She spelled TEDIOUS

CLIVE
(skeptical)
Where would she get a word like that

ELSA
Shes telling us shes bored
(to Dren)
Why are you bored honey Do you
want to play a game or something

Frustrated without bothering to seek out more tiles she
rearranges the letters to spell a new word O-U-T-S-I-D-E
Elsa stares down at the anagram with amazement

ELSA (CONTD)
Oh Dren
(sadly apologetic)
No I know But you cant go outside
Im sorry You just cant

In a sudden fit of anger Dren shoves herself backwards
knocking over the table food letters everything

ELSA (CONTD)
Dren Come back here

Dren tears across the room

ELSA (CONTD)
Come back here right now

Elsa rushes over grabs Dren by the neck and arm

ELSA (CONTD)
I said COME HERE

Physically Dren is now Elsas equal but the Hybrid succumbs
as Elsa pulls her back to the table Clive rights the
furniture and Elsa shoves Dren back into her chair

CLIVE
Elsa cool it

Elsa spins on him

ELSA
You saw what she did

Clive takes Elsa by the shoulders trying to calm her down

CLIVE
All right Its over

Elsa is suddenly wracked with guilt and hurt

ELSA
I just Shes getting so hard to
control

CLIVE

But shes okay now

Clive glances over Elsas shoulder and finds that Dren has
in fact left her seat He hears a noise overhead He and
Elsa look up and are startled to see Dren clamoring up a
network of pipes leading to the ceiling

ELSA
Dren Stop that

Dren swings along pipes and support beams and deliberately
kicks out panes of glass from the skylight SMASH Shards
rain down Clive and Elsa stumble back to avoid them

Dren catapults herself through the skylight and disappears
onto the roof

CLIVE
Shit

They run for the door
EXT PASTEURIZATION BARN -- EVENING

Clive scrambles up a slender ladder along the back of the
arched building Elsa follows a few rungs behind

EXT PASTEURIZATION BARN - ROOF -- EVENING

The roof has a narrow path along the center of its arch
One wrong step and its a slippery slide down to a thirty-
foot drop

Clive and Elsa climb breathlessly up to see Dren at the far
side of the skylight back arched eyes wide once again
bedazzled by the breadth of open space

Elsa and Clive slowly shuffle across the roof towards her

ELSA
Dren Sweetie Come inside okay

Dren snaps her attention to the approaching couple She
takes a corresponding number of backward steps

ELSA (CONTD)
Be careful honey We just want you
to stay with us Where youre safe

They ease past the broken windows of the skylight Dren
continues to back away determined not to be contained

CLIVE
Cmon Dren Were not angry

Dren is getting dangerously close to the far end of the roof
Elsa looks terrified

ELSA
DREN COME HERE THIS INSTANT

Her raised voice startles Dren back another step Her feet
pivot on the edge of the roof Her torso swings back and
forth desperate to regain her balance

ELSA (CONTD)
No

Dren overcompensates and is about to fall backwards when

A cascade of feathers bursts through the skin under her arms
Magnificent wings with shimmering translucent plumage

The wings instinctively flap lifting her body just enough
to regain her balance She releases a triumphant SHRIEK and
lets the wings relax and settle at her sides Shreds of
dry leathery skin flake away in the breeze

With the emergence of the wings the lumpen misshapen mass
of her back has transformed itself Her body is now lean
streamlined elegant and complete

Clive and Elsa observe her speechlessly Their ugly duckling
has become a swan

Dren unfurls her wings proudly turns to face the forest
with its world of sensation and mystery She crouches as
though prepared to launch into flight

CLIVE
Dren stop

Dren pauses looks back over her shoulder

CLIVE (CONTD)
Please dont

Dren keeps her eyes trained on Clive Something in his
pleading tone is having an effect He takes a few cautious
steps forward Elsa watches too frightened to interfere

CLIVE (CONTD)
Dren Dont go We need you
(gauging her reaction)
We love you Dren

Clive holds out his hand Dren feels the pull of freedom
But the pull of Clive is stronger Her wings abruptly
retract She plunges forward into his arms All at once
she is shaking and scared A terrified child

Clive holds her tight stroking her back Elsa allows herself
to breathe relieved And just a tad jealous

INT PASTEURIZATION BARN -- NIGHT

The skylight has been boarded shut The last bit of natural
light is cut off

Two sizable steaks are dropped onto an electric grill They
explode with a LOUD SIZZLE Clive is cooking Elsa is
examining the latest miracle of Drens physiology

CLIVE
(to Dren)
Smells pretty good huh

Dren watches hungrily from her chair

ELSA
You shouldnt be rewarding her for
escaping

CLIVE
Im rewarding her for coming back
(to Dren)
Good girl

Dren seems to preen at his encouraging tone Clive cant
resist a quick glance down her newly feminized body the
slender trace of an hour-glass figure

CLIVE (CONTD)
Youre not a little girl anymore
Are you
(to Elsa)
Do you think shell ever fly

ELSA
Dont be ridiculous shed need chest
muscles like a quarterback

(MORE )

ELSA (CONTD)
(indicating the wings)
I think theyre more decorative
than anything else

Elsa regards Dren wistfully Like shes lost her baby girl
to this new species of young woman

INT FARMHOUSE KITCHEN -- MORNING

Next morning Elsa types notes into her laptop While eating
cereal Clive studies one of Drens new feathers utterly
fascinated

He rubs the feather in one direction against the cereal box
Its translucent hair-like threads gently give way

CLIVE
Its incredibly delicate

Elsa stops typing and takes the feather and runs it the other
way slicing through the box like a razor

ELSA
And dangerous
(beat)
You have to stop contradicting me in
front of Dren

CLIVE
What

ELSA
If I say one thing you cant always
be saying no its okay or she
doesnt like that

CLIVE
I dont do that Do I do that

ELSA
Just dont make me the bitch okay
(back to her work)
Im not the bad guy

CLIVE
Alright Im sorry

Clive gets up dumping his bowl into the kitchen sink

CLIVE (CONTD)
We should get going

Elsa doesnt move

ELSA
Go ahead

CLIVE
Elsa we talked about this You
have to show your face We have to
keep up appearances

ELSA
Im not wasting my time on Barlows
lost cause
(beat)
Im staying here with Dren

Clive scoops up his duffel bag and heads for the door
CLIVE
Great I guess that just leaves me
to handle the real world
He slams the door pissed

EXT FARMHOUSE -- DAY

Clive marches to his car slows as he passes the barn From
inside he can hear Drens beautiful birdsong

Clive presses close to the wall of the barn peering through
the cracks in the clapboard exterior

CLIVES POV Barely visible through the slats Dren sits
perched elegantly on an overhanging beam She looks like a
statue the only thing betraying life are the exquisitely
alien tones that tumble from her puckered lips

Clive cant bring himself to take his eyes off her until
unexpectedly and with shocking speed she stares right back
at him

Instinctively he presses himself flat against the wall
Like hes been caught doing something terribly wrong He
hustles over to his car and tears down the dusty drive
INT BIRTHING CHAMBER -- DAY

Dexter works with glum fortitude at his work station Clive

is seated next to him In his hand is Drens feather Dexter

wont even look at it

CLIVE
Its incredible Dex The way shes
changing She shes like this
impossible symphony of biological
processes that just keeps--

DEXTER
(interrupting)

Stop it Will you listen to yourself
(MORE )
DEXTER (CONTD)
(beat)
Shes a mistake A mistake were
all going to regret For a very
long time

CLIVE
Shes a living being

DEXTER
Who was never meant to exist We
could lose everything Everything

CLIVE
You dont know that Maybe this is
what were supposed to be doing
Maybe its a natural part of
evolution Did you ever think of
that

Dexter gives his brother a hard long look
DEXTER

You know you can still get out of
this Its not too late

CLIVE
What are you talking about
DEXTER
Turn her in
CLIVE
Are you fucking nuts
DEXTER
If you come clean They might cut

you some slack You made a mistake
You got caught up in Elsas craziness
I know she coerced you into it

CLIVE
Whoa whoa Wait a second Thats
not true And even if it was why
would anyone believe it

DEXTER
Because thats what Id tell them

Clive stares at his brother in stunned disbelief Then

CLIVE
Youre jealous Youre jealous
because weve done something
unbelievable

DEXTER
Shh Jesus Lower your voice

CLIVE
-Because one of us got to be a
genius And it wasnt you

Dexter just blinks speechless in the face of Clives bizarre
emotional assault

DEXTER
(hushed)
Im just trying to help you

CLIVE
(between his teeth)
Dexter I havent needed your help
since we were twelve

Clive storms from the room Heads turn Barlow notes his
exit

INT PASTEURIZATION BARN -- DAY

Elsa enters the barn and gently approaches Dren holding up
a hair-brush as though it were a new toy Dren looks at it
curious but remains distant and cool

ELSA
Guess what were going to do

Elsa gently brushes Drens hair which has recently grown
quite long and full Dren watches herself in the cracked
mirror fascinated but reluctant to exhibit pleasure

ELSA (CONTD)
See how pretty youve become Look
how long it is now
(beat)
Youre going to have to learn how to
be a grownup

Elsa puts down the brush and opens the small drawer in the
table to retrieve an elastic band She notices several
mottled sheets of paper under a stack of blank sheets as
though deliberately stashed away

ELSA (CONTD)
What are these

Dren goes rigid Elsa pulls out a series of slightly crumpled
drawings made with colored pencils They are crude
rudimentary attempts at a face but as she flips through

them they exhibit a clear progression of ability

ELSA (CONTD)
Did you do these These are
wonderful

As she gets towards the bottom of the stack and the sketches
become increasingly complex it is obvious that all of them
are of Clive

ELSA (CONTD)
(hiding disappointment )
Theyre really good Dren Are there
any of me

Dren remains frozen her eyes locked on her own reflection
If her odd hybrid features could express embarrassment this
might be it

Elsas hand scrambles into the drawer pulling out some fresh
paper and a handful of colored pencils

ELSA (CONTD)
Show me Show me how you draw

Elsa tilts one of the mirrors so that Dren can get a good
look at her face

ELSA (CONTD)
Will you do one of me
(beat)
Please

Dren unfreezes and abruptly grabs up all the pictures of
Clive She bolts with them to her hiding place

Elsa sighs then strides sternly across the room

ELSA (CONTD)
Its just the two of us young lady
Youre going to have to learn whos
boss

Elsa pulls aside the plastic sheet and discovers Dren crouched
inside cradling the cat in her arms stroking it obsessively

ELSA (CONTD)
Dren Whats that Where did you
get that

Dren shimmies deeper into her hiding spot

ELSA (CONTD)
Give it to me

Elsas hand snatches out and grabs the cat by the scruff of
the neck yanking it away Dren YELPS

ELSA (CONTD)
Im sorry Dren We cant keep it
(beat)
We cant take a chance It could
make you sick
Dren is horrified She reaches out for her beloved cat but
Elsa coldly stands up and steps back suddenly the stern
matron
ELSA (CONTD)
You cant always have what you want
Thats a part of growing up too

Elsa heads for the door Drens knees curl up under her
arms Her eyes squint with rage

INT FARMHOUSE - COMMON ROOM -- DAY

Elsa enters the farmhouse with the cat places it on the
floor It MEOWS needily She goes to the fridge pours some
milk into a saucer and lays it next to the cat who hungrily
laps it up

Elsa sees a portrait of her mother on the wall Her face
stern and joyless the trademark swatch of white hair trailing
down her left cheek

Something like regret plays across Elsas face

EXT FARM -- EVENING

Clives car pulls up the drive

INT FARMHOUSE -- EVENING

Clive comes into the darkened farmhouse

CLIVE
El

No sign of her He explores deeper into the house

INT FARMHOUSE - ELSAS OLD BEDROOM -- EVENING

The door opens a crack Clive pokes his head inside Elsa
is fast asleep curled up child-like on the tiny mattress

Clive gently pulls a blanket over her then quietly leaves
the room shutting the door behind him

INT PASTEURIZATION BARN -- NIGHT

Clive enters the barn He hears a rustle and sees Dren curled
by her private space

Clive walks over and kneels next to her Dren stares at the
floor her jaw is set and angry

CLIVE
Whats the matter girl

Dren melts into sorrow the way a child responds to pity
She launches herself into Clives sympathetic arms
shuddering

CLIVE (CONTD)
Bad day

Clive pulls her gently to her feet

CLIVE (CONTD)
Lets lighten things up around here

Clive moves to another part of the room slides a CD into a
boom-box on the counter Its the rendition of Under My
Skin that Dren likes

The music perks her up She sways in time with it chortling
and whistling

Clive does a comical two-step that brings a hint of a smile
to Drens face Emulating him she sways from foot to foot
in time with the music

CLIVE (CONTD)
Atta-girl I knew we got the dance
gene in there

Clive comes up to her positions Drens arms on his shoulders
putting one hand above her hip the other gently on her back
He leads her in a clumsy rocking slow dance slightly
ridiculous at first -- like the ill-matched couples in an
elementary school gymnasium

CLIVE (CONTD)
Follow my lead

They slowly find a measure of synch despite their differing
anatomy Clives lead sets an elegant rhythm

CLIVE (CONTD)
Ill show you how the pros do it

Clive throws a couple of variations into the foot work
Dren now in the groove follows perfectly They become
graceful and lightfooted

CLIVE (CONTD)
My first girlfriend made me take
dance lessons
(beat)
Dont tell Elsa

As though triggered by the hint of conspiracy Dren tightens
her grip on Clive drawing him in close The move is subtle
adjusting her balance but they now dance body-to-body

Drens eyes close her head rolls back getting lost in the
music and the intimacy Despite himself Clive is becoming
aroused He notes the sensuous length of her neck the arch
of her back her hair

He freezes Drops his arms Drens eyes open bewildered
Wondering what shes done wrong

Clive gently brushes back Drens hair where he finds a SINGLE
SHOCK OF WHITE

CLIVE (CONTD)
(under his breath)
Elsa

Dren is annoyed that Elsas name should interrupt the dance
Clive steps back from her shaken

CLIVE (CONTD)
Okay Thats enough
(beat)
Thats enough dancing Dren

Clive walks over to the boom box and smacks the STOP button
then strides off towards the door

CLIVE (CONTD)
Good night

He makes a hasty exit leaving Dren slumped in the middle of
the barn like a jilted date

INT FARMHOUSE - COMMON ROOM -- MORNING
Elsa emerges from her childhood bedroom rubbing her eyes
Clive is already dressed for work sipping coffee at the
table looking angry
ELSA
I thought I was taking a quick nap
I must have I slept like a rock

CLIVE
Its your DNA

ELSA
What

CLIVE
In Dren

Elsa doesnt have a response theres no denying it

CLIVE (CONTD)

You put yourself into the experiment

(furious grasping
for the right words)

How could What were you I
mean was this ever about the science

ELSA

Of course it was It still is

CLIVE

If you really believe that then youre
even more fucked up than I thought

ELSA

Whats that supposed to mean

CLIVE

Im sick of it Im tired of being

your crutch Im tired of your

secrets And your lies

ELSA

I didnt lie I didnt say whos

DNA did I

CLIVE
Yeah you were very careful

What

was it Healthy female Clean

heredity

ELSA
Exactly Why not me

Clive bolts out of his chair heading for the door

CLIVE

Maybe you should take another glance

at your family history

Clive makes a slamming exit leaving Elsa alone with his

parting jab

INT FARMHOUSE - COMMON ROOM -- DAY

Elsa sits depressed at the table her face tight with
frustration and anger She feels like complete wreckage

Dren is mad at her Clives mad at her

work Everythings falling apart

She hasnt been to

Something brushes past her leg and she looks down Its the

cat rubbing affectionately against her

Elsas face suddenly

softens She picks put the cat and strokes it relieved

that someone anyone isnt hating her

INT PASTEURIZATION BARN -- DAY

Elsa enters the barn locking the door behind her with the
key she wears around her neck She carries a cardboard box
under one arm

ELSA
Dren cmere honey I have something
for you

Dren emerges from her private hiding space cautious but
curious Elsa sits cross-legged on the floor patting a
spot in front of her for Dren to sit Dren sullenly complies

ELSA (CONTD)
Cant you smile for me

Dren lifts her head expressionless eyes on Elsa eager to
demonstrate that she doesnt merit a smile

ELSA (CONTD)
You know I love you dont you

Elsa gives her a warm loving smile Dren maintains her
cold stare not giving an inch Elsa gives her words extra
emphasis determined that Dren understand

ELSA (CONTD)
Youre a part of me And Ima part

of you Im inside you
(beat)

Ill always be here for you Always

Elsa opens the box and presents the cat Drens face grows
instantly alert She glances at Elsa slightly mistrusting

ELSA (CONTD)
There you go You can keep her
Why not Its nice to have a pet

Elsa gently places the cat on the floor It approaches Dren
rubbing against her leg

Dren cocks her head

Her tail suddenly lashes out -- its deadly stinger jabbing
the cat in the skull It drops dead instantly

ELSA (CONTD)
(horrified)
My God Oh my God Dren

Dren finally gives her the smile she wanted Elsa lashes
out slapping her hard across the face

Elsa brings both hands up to her own mouth shocked at what
Dren has provoked

In the same instant Dren lunges forward pouncing on her
knocking her down A clawed foot grabs the key from around
Elsas neck and rips it off The spiked tail hovers close
to her face

Theres a moment between them where it seems that Dren might
actually sting her Elsas eyes register real fear The
power balance has tipped

Then Dren pushes Elsa backwards sending her sprawling across
the floor and makes a break for the front door She awkwardly
works the key into the lock CLICK It opens

With a SQUAWK Dren pulls off the lock and opens the door
Inviting sunlight washes over her as

WHAP Something has struck the back of Drens head She
drops

Elsa stands panting over her a rusted milk can in her hands
103 INT BARN -- LATER

Dren wakes to find her arms legs and tail secured to an
examination table

Elsa stands over her a scalpel in hand her face utterly
devoid of emotion She speaks in a detached clinical manner
into a tape recorder

ELSA
(into tape recorder)
Physically H-50 has evolved well
However recent violent behavior
suggest dangerous psychological
developments

She brings the knife up to Drens scalp Dren CRIES OUT
fights against her restraints For a moment we might think
that Elsa is about to perform brain surgery

ELSA (CONTD)
Erratic behavior may be caused by a
disproportionate species
identification Cosmetically human
affectations should be eliminated
wherever possible

Elsa clicks off the recorder and takes a handful of Drens
hair She painfully hacks it off with the scalpel In this
way Elsa shears Drens beautiful mane until she is left
with a patchy shorn mess Dren MEWS in anguish at this
humiliation

Then with growing terror Dren watches as Elsa moves to the
opposite end of the table where a small tray of surgical
instruments waits Elsa CLICKS the recorder back on

ELSA (CONTD)
Due to her unstable condition it
has become necessary to remove her
zootoxin glands and stinger

Elsa snaps off the recorder sets it down by the tray She
hazards a glance at Dren Her creation watches her wide-
eyed with terror

Elsa brakes the gaze pulls up a surgical mask and jabs a
hypodermic needle into Drens tail With frigid disregard
she selects a slender bone-saw from the tray and begins her
work

Dren lets out a SAVAGELY SHRILL SCREAM
104 EXT ABANDONED DAIRY FARM -- EVENING

Clive drives up to the barn He thinks he hears a HIGH-PITCHED
SCREAM under the SOUND OF THE RADIO He snaps off the music
but theres nothing

105 INT PASTEURIZATION BARN -- EVENING

Clive lets himself in and is confronted with the horrific
aftermath of an improvised surgery Dren is strapped semi-
conscious to the table Elsa is bandaging the stump of her
tail Long locks of hair litter the floor near a puddle of
congealing blood

Dren cranes her neck and cries out to Clive her fingers
flexing and clawing under the straps

CLIVE
What the fuck are you doing

ELSA
What I had to

Clive sees an eight-inch segment of tail laying in the sink

CLIVE
Jesus Christ Elsa

Clive rushes to the table to unstrap Dren but Elsa grabs
his wrist

ELSA
Shes become unstable She killed a
cat She almost killed me

CLIVE
And so you cut off her hair

Elsa doesnt respond She simply takes the chunk of Drens
tail in her rubber-gloved hand and places it carefully in a
small picnic cooler filled with ice cubes

ELSA
Are you any closer to finding the
protein

CLIVE
What does that have to do with
anything

ELSA

You havent because youre working
with tissue thats been dead too
long

Clive catches her meaning

CLIVE
We dont know that she has it

ELSA
Of course she does She has
everything Ginger and Fred had And
more

Elsa moves for the door

CLIVE
Where are you going

ELSA
Im going to solve this thing Im
going to put things right

She makes her exit Within moments Clive can hear the engine
of their car start

He rushes over to Dren unties her

CLIVE
Dren

Dren looks to him with wounded frightened eyes as if he
were an accomplice in her torture She weakly retreats to
the corner

Clive takes in the shambles of this private hell the
deteriorating condition of the barn At his feet is the
carcass of the dead cat

106 EXT FAMILY PLOT -- TWILIGHT

Clive shovels dirt out of a hole about the size of a large
shoe box A few feet away is the tombstone of Elsas mother

He gently lowers a small package wrapped in paper towel into
the hole A breeze blows aside the paper and we see that
its the cat

107 INT MAIN LAB -- NIGHT
Dark and empty but for a light on at a single work station

Elsa is working hard through the night The cooler is at
her feet A pot of coffee smolders near the microscope

Theres a desperate urgency to her work but an unstoppable
determination in her eyes Shes going to do it

108 INT FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Clive is agitated pacing the floor of the bedroom with a
tumbler of ice-cubes in one hand He fumbles on the dresser
with a bottle of scotch He pours himself a healthy hit of
liquor tosses it down his throat

His laptop is open On-screen is a webcam feed from the
barn several cameras trained on various angles encompassing
the room No sign of Dren

All at once her face pops up Clive catches this Comes
close Then as if sensing his presence she abruptly
disappears

He flips through several windows picking her up again from
another angle She climbs the step ladder removes her
hospital gown and slides into her water tank

He calls up an underwater camera Dren sensuously rolls her
naked body against the wall of the pool the water acting
like a healing salve for her damaged tail He cant get over
how lithe and womanly she has become

Instinctively he reaches out and runs his fingers along her
image As he does this Drens own hand reaches out and
impossibly brushes past the camera mirroring his gesture

Clive jumps back jolted from his trance He slams the laptop
shut He grabs the bottle of scotch and slides to the floor
pouring a large gulp down his throat

109 INT MAIN LAB -- MORNING

Elsa gathers her things into her knapsack in higher spirits
than weve seen in a while

As she moves to the door it swings open She lets out a
startled gasp Its Barlow

ELSA
Bill youre early

BARLOW
Let me get this straight
(MORE )

BARLOW (CONTD)
You stay home because youre sick
But now I find you sneaking around
when no ones here

ELSA
Making up for lost time

BARLOW
Its too late for that They wont
extend the deadline Its over
Youve screwed us all
(beat)
While youre here you might as well
clear out Clives desk

ELSA
I dont think so

Barlow explodes

BARLOW
No one cares about what you think
anymore Youre an embarrassment to
this company Its going to take
years to--

ELSA
The proteins been synthesized

Barlow is rendered speechless She pushes past him and heads
for the door

ELSA (CONTD)
(on the way out)
Its in the fridge When some real
scientists get here have them take
a look

INT FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM -- MORNING
A beam of sunlight smacks Clive across the eyes He hauls
himself upright with a pained groan Whisky and guilt are

twin swords slicing his brain

CLIVE
Elsa EL

INT FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Clive trudges though the common room still a little drunk
and clearly in pain

CLIVE
Elsa

He shuffles out the front door

INT PASTEURIZATION BARN -- MOMENTS LATER
Clive finds the barn empty Elsa is not there nor is Dren

CLIVE
Elsa Dren

He zeroes-in on Drens special hiding place but shes not
there

He bounds up the step ladder only to find the murky water
Dren-less Hes beginning to panic rushing around the tank
As he turns WHAM Dren is on him

Shes planted him with a full-on open-mouthed kiss Clive
pulls himself out of it perhaps a little reluctantly

CLIVE (CONTD)
Dren you cant what are you doing

Dren stares at him hungrily Her parted lips have a fullness
hed never noticed Her eyes shine with unabashed pure
lust The knowledge that some part of her is Elsa somehow
heightens the moment

When her mouth finds its way back to his he plunges in with
abandon Her hospital gown falls off one shoulder Dren
wraps her legs around Clives torso driving her breasts up
to his face her wings unfurl flapping excitedly

Clive presses her up against the water tank They writhe to
the floor gown riding up over her waist Clive quickly
fumbles open his pants tears open his shirt

His mouth is all over her marble-white torso Drens tail
rides up between his legs exploring She arches her back
allowing entry Clives body surrenders to the moment

In the growing excitement the bandage on Drens tail begins
to tear off The stump has already healed over -- And the

severed stinger has grown back protruding from the new sheath
of skin and dripping with fresh venom

It curls around Clive a hairs breadth from his naked skin
But Clive is oblivious building to climax

A STARTLED GASP pulls him out of it
Clive and Dren freeze as one Clive quickly turns and sees
Elsa paralyzed near the door Her mouth hangs open in an

expression of shocked repulsion Clive scuttles off Dren
clumsily reassembling his pants

ELSA
(hysterical)
Get away Stay away from me
CLIVE
Elsa Im sorry I dont

Clive stands midway between Elsa and Dren His lips mumble
looking for the right words They dont exist

He turns from Elsas disbelieving grimace to Drens horrified
face as she sits there half-naked abandoned in mid-coitus
Their looks are IDENTICAL Mother and daughter The
resemblance hammers Clives brain

Elsa finally unfreezes She backs toward the door gets a
hand on the doorknob and tears out of there Clive takes
off after her clutching his open shirt slamming the door
behind him

Dren is left on the floor by the tank her face still wearing
Elsas horror

EXT DAIRY FARM -- MORNING

Elsa is already in her car backing around to make a forward
exit Clive pounds on the drivers-side window

CLIVE
Elsa dont go Talk to me

Clive watches helplessly as Elsa burns away with SCREECHING
TIRES He grips his hair Looks to the pasteurization barn
then at the dusty trail of the receding vehicle
CLIVE (CONTD)
(softly)
Fuck

Clive quickly locks the barn then clamors into the van and
drives off after her

INT CLIVE AND ELSAS APARTMENT -- EVENING

Clive enters the apartment Sees a stack of mail has
collected on the floor Theres a light on in the kitchen

INT CLIVE AND ELSAS APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- EVENING

Clive finds Elsa at the kitchen table staring into space
He approaches sheepish not sure what to expect

CLIVE
El
ELSA
(low)
Dont

CLIVE
I guess Im sorry isnt worth much

Elsa explodes

ELSA
IM SORRY Im sorry means nothing
It doesnt take ANYTHING away

CLIVE
It just happened I barely knew

ELSA
I dont even know who you are anymore
Youve become something sick
(beat)
Forget about what it means to me
There are some things you just DO
NOT DO

Clive lets her rage wash over him But something
catches in his mind It takes a moment for words

Finally

Now Clive

CLIVE
(quietly)
We changed the rules

ELSA
Youre not talking your way out of
this

CLIVE
We crossed a line After that
things got confused

ELSA
Confused about what

CLIVE
Right and wrong

ELSA
I dont think youre in a position
to talk to me about right and wrong

is finding his anger

CLIVE
Oh And you are Why did you want
to make her in the first place For
the betterment of mankind

(MORE )

she said
to emerge

CLIVE (CONTD)
(no response)
You didnt want an normal child
because you were afraid of losing
control But an experiment thats
something else

ELSA
I love her

CLIVE
So do I But we fucked up El
Jesus Christ We chained her up
Locked her away from the world
Sawed off her fucking tail

Elsa holds her head in her hands Regret is beginning eclipse
rage

ELSA
I cut off her tail
(beat)
It seemed like a good idea at the
time

CLIVE
Fuck Everything seemed like a good
idea

Clive glances around the apartment taking in their old life
Their wide-screen tv surround-sound stereo games gadgets
luxuries Their wall of books and toys

CLIVE (CONTD)
I just wish things could go back to
the way they were

Elsa raises her head wiping tears from her eyes Shes
bucking up Shes getting her head straight

ELSA
I synthesized the protein

CLIVE
(stunned)
What

ELSA
The CD-356 level in her bloods ten
times higher than what Ginger and
Fred ever had Shes boiling over
with it

CLIVE
Then we could save things Put
our lives back together

ELSA
We could start to Except for

CLIVE
Except For Her

Clive just stares at Elsa An unspoken understanding Elsa
whispers

ELSA
We cant do that

Clives silence says everything

ELSA (CONTD)
We cant We have a responsibility

CLIVE
The experiment is over Our
responsibility is to end it

Elsa begins to concede to his chilling logic

ELSA
--How

CLIVE
The most humane way possible

EXT ABANDONED FARM -- DAY

Clive and Elsa have returned They slam the doors to the
van and head towards the barn without a word Clive has a
large hypodermic needle in his hand already uncapped
INT PASTEURIZATION BARN -- DAY

The RATTLE of the lock The SQUEAK of the door opening
Clive and Elsa enter the barn and quickly bolt the door behind
them

Elsa calls out careful not to let even a hint of emotion
enter her voice

ELSA
Dren Come out Dren

There is no sign of her The room is quiet Too quiet

Clive goes to her hiding place Nothing They scan the
rafters

Elsa climbs up the step ladder to peer into the tank The
water is murky a slight film on the surface She brushes
the water with her hand Elsa leans in closer

Drens face bobs to the surface Elsa jumps back nearly
losing her balance but Dren is completely inert Eyes stare
sightlessly at her

ELSA (CONTD)
(suddenly panicked)
Clive Help me

Clive joins her by the rim sees Elsa struggling under Drens
dead weight isnt sure what to do

ELSA (CONTD)
Come on

Clive drops the needle Together with difficulty they
manage to hoist Dren out of the water and lower her to the
floor She feels Drens forehead

ELSA (CONTD)
Fever

Dren convulses Her head shaking body buckling Elsa drops
to her knees checking Drens vital signs puts her head to
the creatures chest

ELSA (CONTD)
Faint Barely there

Elsa takes Dren under the arms Clive goes around to the
feet Together they move Dren away from the tank

They gently set Dren down on a cot Elsa fills the sink
with water

ELSA (CONTD)
Open the door

CLIVE
What

ELSA
Get some fresh air in here

Elsa comes back to Dren wiping her brow with a cool damp
cloth

Clive opens the doors to the barn Fresh air and daylight
wash over Dren pulling her back into consciousness Her
eyes drift to the opening A gateway to trees sky a whole
universe that she was never allowed to experience

Elsa sees this feels the regret of a failed parent One
that could never allow her child to prosper in the world

Slowly Drens eyes grow weary She drifts back into
unconsciousness

CLIVE
What do we do

Elsa shakes her head No answers

INT BARN -- NIGHT
The light has grown dim Clive is asleep in an old arm chair

The sound of SOBBING wakes him He opens his eyes sees
Elsa from behind hunched crying

Dren lies on the cot deathly still

He reaches for Elsa Then draws his hand back knowing his
touch can only make things worse

EXT FAMILY PLOT -- NIGHT

Clive climbs out of a freshly dug shallow grave in the family
plot next to where the cat had been buried Elsas mother
nearby

A single lantern lights their farewell

Elsa gently drops the Barbie doll into the grave Drens
body is already down there wrapped in Elsas old blanket

CLIVE
Do you uh want to say anything

Elsa shakes her head

There are no more tears no more words Just the dreadful
weight of remorse

Clive shovels earth into the grave

EXT BARN -- NIGHT

A bonfire crackles in a garbage can near the entrance to the
barn Clive throws clothes molted feathers garbage any
remaining evidence of Dren into the flames

INT BARN -- NIGHT

The barn is nearly cleaned out the vat drained equipment
boxed and prepped for moving

Elsa sweeps the last of the garbage off the floor She jams
the broom into Drens old hiding place and draws back a pile
of papers She is suddenly stuck with emotion

These are drawings that Dren had made of Elsa Not one not
two but many sketches All of them hidden away

All of them speaking of a secret love that a daughter had
for a mother

Tears well in Elsas eyes Clive steps into the barn with a
wheeled dolly

CLIVE
Almost done

Elsa swallows her emotion speaks without turning to him

ELSA
Almost

Clive nods Feels her anguish But can say nothing more
He hoists a box onto the cart and wheels it to the door

Stops sets it down as he hears THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING
VEHICLE

122 EXT BARN -- NIGHT
Clive and Elsa come out of the barn as a SEDAN roars up the
drive The door flies open and Dexter steps out His
expression is a combination of stern resolve and guilt
DEXTER
Im sorry I had to Its the only
way

The passenger-side door opens and out steps Barlow furious

BARLOW
Alright Lets see it

ELSA
What the fuck Bill
(beat then to Dexter)
What did you tell him

Dexter glares at her long buried resentment rising to the
surface

DEXTER
I didnt have to tell him much

BARLOW

Do you think Im stupid Those
samples you gave me had human DNA
content

(beat)
They didnt come from Ginger and
Fred They came from something else
Something thats still alive

Clive and Elsa cant deny it Hes got them dead to rights

BARLOW (CONTD)
(seething)
And to think you did it under my
watch
(beat)
Now Let me see this thing It
doesnt belong to you

CLIVE
It doesnt belong to anyone

BARLOW
You made it at a Novaphorm lab
Its company property And I want
to see it Right now
Clive and Elsa share a look

BARLOW (CONTD)
Where is it

They say nothing

BARLOW (CONTD)
Fine

Barlow pulls out his cell phone starts to dial

BARLOW (CONTD)
Im calling in a forensic team

ELSA
Shes already dead

Barlow hangs up the phone

Dexter reacts to this news relieved but perhaps a little
saddened also

ELSA (CONTD)
Its over Bill

Elsa pushes past Barlow and heads towards the van He trails
after Elsa Clive follows numbly

BARLOW
I dont believe you

Elsa picks up a shovel off the ground Tosses it to Barlow

ELSA
See for yourself

Barlow catches the shovel looks at it with distaste

ELSA (CONTD)
Shes buried behind the house

BARLOW
And how do I know theres only one

CLIVE
One was enough

SHHHRK

A violent backwash of air Barlows face is frozen in an
odd state of consternation until

-his head slides off his neck And drops on the lawn
The rest of his body crumbles after it

Elsa SCREAMS stumbles backwards Clive reacts stunned
as

Something lands on the ground between them Something big
DREN

Covered in grave dirt

Resurrected Transformed

MALE

The difference in physiology is unmistakable The eyes are
now set in the front of the skull defining him as a predator
The arms more developed hips narrowed pectorals pure
rippling muscle And the wings are massive one still coated
with a streak of Barlow blood

The only detail that clearly marks this as the Dren that we
once knew is the blazing shock of white hair on the left
side of his head

Male-Dren turns to Elsa takes a threatening step forward

CLIVE (CONTD)
El run

But shes frozen to the spot transfixed by this macabre
transformation Dren takes another menacing step forward

Clive leaps between them Male-Dren instantly attacks
effortlessly flinging Clive into the burning trash can
spilling its contents and setting the ground alight

Dexter lunges to retrieve the shovel He picks it up and
swings In a blur of movement Male-Dren deftly dodges it
and with one sweep of his wings leaps off Clive dragging
Dexter into the darkness

Elsa rushes over to Clive bloodied but not badly injured
and pulls him to his feet They watch helpless as sounds of
violence fill the air

CLIVE (CONTD)
Dexter

No response

CLIVE (CONTD)
Dexter

A deadening calm descends Nothing but the CRACKLING FIRE
Flames lap at the barn door

Elsa tries to pull Clive away

ELSA
Come on

Clive shakes her off

CLIVE
DEXTER

Elsa abandons him bolts for the van
123 INT VAN -- NIGHT

Elsa jumps into the drivers seat hands shaking she pats
her pockets searching for the keys

Clive wrenches open the drivers-side door

CLIVE
We cant leave
ELSA
Wheres the keys
CLIVE
I am not leaving my brother
ELSA
Hes gone
CLIVE

No hes--

WHAM SOMETHING DROPS FROM THE SKY AND LANDS ON THE
WINDSHIELD

Dexter Savagely mauled and very dead

Elsa cries out Clive stares mute
From above THE SOUND OF POWERFUL FLAPPING WINGS

Elsa swallows her horror leaps out of the van and grabs
Clive

ELSA
COME ON

Hes in shock She half-pushes half-drags him in the
direction of the farmhouse

INT FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

Elsa and Clive burst inside freaking out Elsa locks the
door behind them

INT FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Elsa and Clive stumble into the kitchen She wets a rag in
the sink and dabs his wounds

ELSA
You okay

CLIVE
What happened

Elsa is struck with a realization
ELSA
Ginger The same thing that happened
to Ginger

CRASH Something heavy has landed on the roof SCRATCHING
CLAWING FOOTSTEPS track over their heads

Elsa draws a butcher knife from the kitchen counter

CRASH Glass shatters in one of the closed rooms

Elsa stands frozen staring at the door to her old bedroom
From beyond the door she hears a LOUD ROAR and the TINKLING
OF GLASS Shes drawn to it despite herself

Clive sniffs the air Elsa thrusts open the door

CLIVE
Dont

WHOOSH Flames belch from the room in an explosive backdraft
Elsa is propelled to the floor She watches mesmerized as
a chunk of barn lays burning on the mattress Apparently
Male-Dren thrust it through the window The entire room in
flames Hes smoking them out

Clive grabs Elsa wrenching her from the sight

CLIVE (CONTD)
Come on

Clive drags Elsa to the door He grabs a flashlight from
the counter Together they stumble out into the night

EXT FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

They burst out of the house Clive clutching the flashlight
Elsa the butcher knife She yanks on his arm

ELSA
(terrified)
Clive
He turns sees
Male-Dren perched on the roof silhouetted by flames
They are frozen by the sight
Slowly with frightening grace Male-Dren rises flexes his
wings towering to his full eight-foot-height His face
shows no evidence of compassion Old Drens capacity for
human emotion has been replaced by pure animal impulse
He SCREECHES A DEAFENING SCREAM then crouches to pounce
Clive and Elsa bolt for the forest
EXT FOREST -- NIGHT

Clive and Elsa stumble over rough terrain Branches whip
their face and arms Thick bushes tear at their legs

Above FLAPPING WINGS followed by the RUSTLE OF BRANCHES
FLAP RUSTLE FLAP RUSTLE Its getting closer

It sounds like Male-Dren is flinging himself from tree to
tree tracking them from above And then nothing Silence
They resume their run

EXT BOG -- NIGHT

They stumble into a waist-deep SWAMPY BOG Elsa scrambles
out onto a rocky embankment Clive struggles through the
sucking mud gets stuck

ELSA
Come on

CLIVE
I cant

Cursing Elsa tries to pull him up on a rock but they slip
knocking the flashlight into the water Clive watches
helplessly as it sinks the beam illuminating its descent

ELSA
No

Grabbing a stick she lies on her belly and prods the muddy
bottom

CLIVE
Let it go

ELSA
We need it

Clive inches ahead of her laying himself prone on ground

CLIVE
Ill get it

Clive grasps the stick and prods deeper for the flashlight

The stick dances around the light finally managing to hook
around the handle

CLIVE (CONTD)
Got it

He pulls the light up illuminating the ghostly face of Male-
Dren who swims amphibian-like under the surface

Elsa screams jumps back Male-Dren grabs the stick and
yanks Clive into the water

ELSA
Clive

Elsa can make out the dim figure of Clive as he is pulled
under Air bubbles to the surface She watches helplessly
as the water churns and the light quickly fades to darkness
And then all becomes still

Elsa bends over the embankment trying to penetrate the murky
liquid

Suddenly Clives face buoys into view

ELSA (CONTD)
Clive

She grabs him by the shirt drags him onto the rock He is
still breathing

And then she sees

Male-Dren rising up water draining from his raptor form
wings spread above ready to pounce

Elsa is immobilized not wanting to leave Clive Male-Dren
stares at her with piercing eyes Its Elsa that he wants
He leaps forward in a blur of motion

She turns bolts through a narrow opening between dense trees

EXT FOREST -- NIGHT
Elsa runs blindly
Ahead is an outcropping of rock She squeezes inside

Something lands on the rock above debris showers over the
opening A HOLLOW CRY

Elsa stifles her breath stares helplessly waiting
Then more FLAPPING WINGS and quiet

As carefully as she can Elsa worms her way out and takes
off

EXT FIELD -- NIGHT

Elsa breaks through the tree-line and tumbles into a sea of
waist-high wheat She weaves through it directionless
panicked

Again the sound of flapping wings overhead

She throws herself to the ground lies under the cover of
wheat choking back her breath

SILENCE

She waits Finally rises cautiously pokes her head above
the horizon of amber her knuckles white around the handle
of the butcher knife

BEHIND HER two enormous multicolored wings silently spread
outward as the form of Male-Dren rises into view

Elsa whirls around The wings envelope her whipping the
knife from her hand flinging it into the wheat field

ELSA
(screeching)
What do you want WHAT DO YOU WANT

Male-Drens mouth opens contorts lips struggling as he
SPEAKS the words are distorted guttural distinctly inhuman
but unmistakable

MALE-DREN
Inside You

EXT SWAMPY BOG -- NIGHT
Clive stirs regaining consciousness At the sound of ELSAS

SCREAM he launches himself into a run for the edge of the
forest

EXT FIELD -- NIGHT

Clive enters the field breathless and in pain Nothing is
visible beyond the rolling horizon of wheat He is about to
turn back when he sees something sticking out of the soil

THE BUTCHER KNIFE He picks it up
Then he hears it STRANGE PURRING and SCRAPING SOUNDS

He pushes into a small clearing of trampled wheat in time to
see Male-Dren on top of Elsa her arms pinned over her head
his pelvis thrusting

Clive is frozen by the sight

He overcomes his paralysis his face hardening He raises
the knife

Elsa sees this is pulled back into awareness looks up
into the face that hangs over hers Male-Dren stiffening in
the grip of sexual ecstasy as he releases inside her

Clive lunges forward driving the knife into the Hybrids
shoulder Male-Dren lets out a HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK He
launches himself up with the force of his wings spinning to
face Clive

Clive swings the knife downward again cleaving into a wing
MORE SCREAMING but this time Male-Dren attacks His wings

swipe and flutter at Clive blowing him backwards with their
wind-force

Clive lands hard The creature pounces on top of him In
that moment it would seem that Clive is done for Then a
rock bounces off Male-Drens head with a brutal CRUNCH

Male-Dren staggers back clearly stunned He turns to face
Elsa a bloody rock in her hands

Weeping Elsa hesitates Theres a moment when she cant
quite do it Cant quite murder

Male-Drens BARBED TAIL flashes out and plunges deep into
Clives chest piercing his heart Clive stiffens chokes
then falls away Instantly dead

Male-Dren arches to the sky lets out a final VICTORIOUS
SCREAM He wrenches the knife out of his chest with a horrid
sucking sound

He turns to Elsa just in time to catch another blow to the
head Male-Dren drops backwards blood gushing from the
impact point

Elsa hoists the rock and hulks over the felled Hybrid

Male-Drens face changes The menacing animal violence fades
away The eyes go soft almost pleading The mouth trembles
taking on recognizably human facets of fear hurt even
betrayal

And she lets the rock drop crushing his skull into a
SICKENING PULP Male-Drens body spasms once or twice before
resting

Elsa falls to her knees numb and drained Tears roll down
her cheeks at the sight of Clives body and the crumpled
mess that was once Dren

She lets herself cry a convulsing weeping while in the
distance the farm burns to the ground

FADE OUT

FADE IN

133 INT NOVAPHORM HEADQUARTERS - JOANS OFFICE -- DAY

Elsa sits at the end of a large desk Her hair is cropped
short the streak of white once an emblem of her uniqueness
has been dyed to match the rest We can assume that a fair
amount of time has passed since her ordeal

At the other side of the desk is Joan Her usual scolding
demeanor is replaced by a generous warmth -- anxious to make
Elsa feel comfortable

JOAN

Your Dren turned out to be a cauldron
of the most unimaginable chemical
mysteries Aside from the intense
concentration of CD-356 in her system
she was riddled with a variety of
completely unique compounds

(pleased)
Well be filing patents for years

Elsa remains mute feeling a little awkward

JOAN (CONTD)
Naturally were extremely excited
that youre willing to take us to
the next stage
(beat)
Especially in light of the um
personal risk

Joan pushes a sheet of paper across the desk for Elsa to
examine

JOAN (CONTD)
We think the figure weve come up
with is very generous

Next she slides a phonebook-sized contract across the desk

JOAN (CONTD)
You can never speak of this To
anyone Ever

Elsa thumbs through the pages Joan walks around the desk
a pen her hand She hesitates before handing it to Elsa

JOAN (CONTD)
Nobody would blame you if you didnt
do this You could just put an end
to it and walk away

Elsa takes the pen from Joans hand and signs with a single
determined stroke

Elsa stands and we see now that her stomach is protruding
noticeably She is QUITE PREGNANT

ELSA
This is what I want

Joan nods impressed by Elsas courage She pulls Elsa close
rocking her with reassurance stroking her hair Gradually
Elsas resistance melts She gives herself to Joans motherly
embrace

THE END
