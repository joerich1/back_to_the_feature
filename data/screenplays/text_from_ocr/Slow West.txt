SILAS SELLECK (VO)
Once upon a time 1870 to be exact
a sixteen year old kid travelled
from the cold shoulder of Scotland
to the baking heart of America to
find his love His name was Jay -
her name was Rose

FADE IN

EXT - COLORADO FOREST - NIGHT 2

Our hero JAY CAVENDISH lies on a blanket a colt six-shooter
gun in his hand and looks up to a sky full of stars

He begins his nightly recital naming each constellation
JAY
Pegasus The Great Bear The

Dragon Andromeda

JAY is sixteen skinny dark hair and dark eyes handsome in
an other-worldly way

He is about to sleep fully clothed and what fine clothes
they are - an exquisitely tailored three piece suit and fine
leather boots

JAY lifts his gun up and points to the night sky and pretends
to shoot

He makes a soft sound on each ‘pretend shot’ and a star
appears and forms Orion

JAY (CONTD)
Orion’s Belt

JAY lowers his gun and smiles as he remembers the love of his
life ROSE ROSS

CUT TO

EXT - SCOTLAND - DREAM FLASHBACK - WINDY BEACH - DAY 3

ROSE ROSS beautiful dressed in peasant clothes sits on top
of JAY smiles

CUT TO
EXT - COLORADO FOREST - NIGHT 4

JAY stows away his gun tucks his wallet into his inside
pocket rolls onto his side shuts his eyes and falls asleep

CUT TO

EXT - COLORADO FOREST - DAWN 5

Next day first light dawn chorus JAY rolls up his blanket
and grabs his duffle bag

TITLE - SLOW WEST

JAY sits on his horse His horse is laden with many bags
cases blankets boxes

JAY pulls out a small wooden box and lifts lid to reveal a
compass

JAY rides off in the direction - WEST

He rides awkwardly though the trees holding the compass
aloft

EXT - EDGE OF FOREST PRAIRIE - DAY 6
JAY rides out of the forest into an open grass prairie

The sun now beats down

Strange structures appear Dotted across the prairie bodies
wrapped in cloth lie on stilts facing the sky

A Native burial ground a happy hunting ground
The stilts are adorned with feathers and beads

JAY weaves through the structures and past a group of native
women sitting preparing dead bodies of men wrapped in cloth

JAY rides past The women ignore him

EXT - FOREST - DAY 7
Into the forest

A line of native women and children pass JAY

The final native carrying a baby looks at JAY as he passes

JAY rides on bringing his compass out again and continuing
West
JAY has another flashing memory of ROSE and their time
together in Scotland

CUT TO

EXT - SCOTLAND - HILLSIDE - DREAM FLASHBACK 8

A strong wind blowing a heathery landscape and beyond a
rough sea

Rose stands on top of a small rock formation and lifts her
arms causing her shawl to flap in the wind

JAY sits next to her

ROSE turns and smiles at JAY then leaps from the small rock
and runs down the hill

CUT TO

EXT - FOREST - DAY 9
JAY rides into a cloud of dense smoke

The forest air becomes ‘foggy’ until JAY is but a faint
silhouette

He and his pony begin to cough
JAY covers his mouth with cloth
The air is thick with ash

Black jagged shapes- burnt stumps of trees emerge from the
grey
Now only shades of grey
SILAS SELLECK (V0O)

I was drifting west when I picked

up his trail - deep in Colorado

Territory - A jack-rabbit in a den

of wolves fortunate to be alive

(The voice over is an older man than JAY with an Irish
accent - Later we will meet the man who owns this voice)

JAY now walking his horse has covered his mouth with a
handkerchief

JAY is covered head to toe in gray ash and so is his horse
JAY enters a clearing

Remains of tee-pee frames and tree stumps smoulder black and
smoke
This was a Native camp freshly razed to the ground
JAY leads his horse through the remains

No bodies The dead removed

Another forest clearing

A distant gun shot startles JAY and his horse

JAY stops

Another gun shot

Then another

JAY walks slowly from his horse

More gunshots

Branches snap under foot from yonder the sound of someone
running towards JAY

A muscular young NATIVE MAN sprints from the brush and skids
to a halt in front of JAY

Bare chested coated in blood

Standing proud and waiting as if preparing to die by JAYS
hand

JAY ash-grey
The young MAN blood-red
For a moment they study each other’s strangeness

Another gunshot and the NATIVE MAN looks around then bolts
past JAY

More rustling and twig snapping as THREE MEN dressed as Union
soldiers emerge

TWO BOYS in dirty old Yankee uniforms and an OLDER MAN in an
officer’s outfit

Guns are quickly raised to point at JAY

OFFICER
Arms abroad boy

JAY raises his arms up

YOUNG SOLDIER 2
Red skinned or white

The coat of ash covering JAY the source of confusion
JAY
Sir I am British Scottish

The officer barks orders to his two protegés

OFFICER
Catch the savage

The two YOUNG SOLDIERS run off into the woods
JAY and the OFFICER stare at each other for a BEAT
Two muffled gunshots then silence
The OFFICER smiles thinking the NATIVE has been killed
JAY
I am Jay Cavendish Son of Lady
Cavendish

OFFICER lowers his rifle and walks towards JAY

OFFICER
We’re all Sons of Bitches

Seemingly from thin air a figure appears behind the OFFICER
and cocks his gun by the OFFICER’S ear while taking the
OFFICER’s gun in one smooth action

This is SILAS SELLECK

Mid thirties lean fit

SILAS is dirt ingrained only his eyes are clean

SILAS looks WILD yet

His movements are skillful economic fast his posture
confident capable and in control to the point of blasé

Succinct in words and action

OFFICER (CONTD)
A grave play boy

JAY draws his gun and points it at SILAS

JAY
Sir Lower your pistol

SILAS sighs then slowly circles round continuing to hold his
gun to the OFFICER’S head and moves towards JAY

JAY (CONTD)
Hey

SILAS moves up to JAY continuing to point the gun at the
OFFICER and snatches JAY’S gun from him

SILAS points JAYS gun at the OFFICER and pulls the trigger
but the gun is empty and clicks

The officer smiles at this but quick as a flash SILAS
raises his own gun up and shoots the officer between the eyes

Dead before he hits the ground

Without taking his eyes off the officer SILAS throws JAYS
gun him

SILAS
Clean it Oil it

JAY fumbles the catch
SILAS walks over to the officer and crouches down

Pulls out a large knife and cuts a pouch from the officers
belt

JAY looks on

JAY
What do you want

SILAS checks the contents of the pouch and stuffs it into his
belt

JAY (CONTD)
He was an Officer

SILAS looks through the man’s pockets and finds a tin

SILAS
Wearin’ a dress don’t make her a
lady

SILAS pockets the tin

SILAS (CONTD)
They ain’t soldiers Least no more
Indian slayers

SILAS moves round and removes the OFFICER’s boots and
addresses JAY without looking up

SILAS (CONT’D)
Keep headin’ West solo youll be
dead by dawn How you made it this
far is a miracle

JAY
I take care of myself
SILAS
Sure kid You need chaperonin’ and
I’m a chaperone
SILAS gets up and walks towards JAY

JAY takes a step back still holding his gun

SILAS walks past JAY and towards JAY’s horse

JAY
Safer to travel with a killer

SILAS
That’s right

SILAS checks out JAY’s laden horse Too many bags and cases
for a small pony to carry

SILAS begins to cut the bags free

SILAS (CONT’D)
First lets save your pony’s life

SILAS cuts a case free and it drops to the ground
SILAS (CONTD)
I counted a dozen of them bastards
attack them Indians back there
Minus three that leaves too many
JAY’s turns and looks into the woods in all directions
SILAS now down on his knees rakes through JAY’s case
Tosses out a kettle throws a useless box over his shoulder
Tosses boots and a shirt
Finds a book looks at the cover and holds it up to JAY
JAY reads the title
JAY
‘Ho for the West A traveller and
Emigrants Hand-book
SILAS keeps looking at JAY
JAY (CONTD)
To Canada and the North West States
of America’

SILAS keeps staring

JAY (CONTD)
-By Edward Hepple Hall

SILAS throws the book over his shoulder

SILAS
Well ho for the West

SILAS casts the whole case aside gets up and walks towards
JAY

SILAS (CONTD)

Dollars Fifty now fifty when we

split
JAY turns his back to SILAS and fumbles in his wallet
Turns back around and hands SILAS fifty dollars

JAY

Until we reach a forest called

Silverghost
SILAS snatches the cash counts it and walks off

SILAS
Lets drift

JAY runs around and picks up his ‘Ho for the West’ book
grabs the reins of his pony and follows SILAS

CUT TO

EXT - FOREST - DAY 10

JAY rides behind SILAS through the forest brushing the
remaining ash from his hair and suit

JAY trots up level with SILAS

JAY
What’s your name

SILAS snaps

SILAS
Drop back single file

JAY drops back behind SILAS
SILAS leads JAY follows staying single file as instructed

JAY (SHOUTS)
Why you headin’ West

SILAS does not respond

JAY (CONTD)
You care not why I’m headed West

No response

JAY (CONTD)
There was an accident - My girl and
her father fled from Scotland
settled out West It was all my
fault

SILAS (TO HIMSELF)
Take a hint kid

JAY
We love each other

SILAS (TO HIMSELF)
Sure you do kid

They ride on in silence

Close up of JAY sound of waves breaking - Another memory of
Rose

EXT - SCOTTISH SAND DUNES - FLASHBACK - DAY 11
Moody grey sky

Large waves crash onto a sandy beach the beach becomes sand
dunes

JAY stands at the top of a large dune
ROSE standing at the bottom shouts up to JAY
ROSE
JAY A thousand ways to die choose
one

JAY strikes a thinking pose

JAY
Bow and arrow

She pulls a pretend arrow from a pretend quiver and pretend
fires it at JAY

JAY pretends to be shot in the heart and falls dramatically

He rolls down the dune to ROSE’s feet and lays still face
up eyes shut tongue out

ROSE jumps on top of JAY and smiles (This is the moment we
saw in JAY’s first memory at the beginning of the film)

JAYS eyes are shut ROSE places her hand on JAY’S chest and
leans in her ear to his chest continuing the charade by
checking if JAY is breathing

JAY places his hands on Rose’s hands

ROSE smiles but pulls away breaking the moment pushes
JAYs head to the side

ROSE
Silly boy

ROSE jumps up
Runs up the dune shouting

ROSE (CONT’D)
My turn

JAY looks up to the sky

EXT - LIGHT FOREST - DAY 12
JAY rides behind SILAS
Low light long shadows

Distant echo of a pretty acapella song emanates from the
trees ahead

JAY head slumped the music stirs him from his daydream
Three AFRICAN MEN clothed in dusty ragged Union soldier

suits sit in a circle one in a makeshift wooden wheel
chair one on crutches wounds from the Civil War

They sing a beautiful Congolese song (They’re Congolese)
SILAS rides straight past JAY stops to listen
SILAS stops grumps spits and turns

SILAS wolf whistles JAY ignores

SILAS shakes his head turns and trots off

The band smile singing for the pleasure of singing The song
ends and the man on crutches looks up at JAY

SINGER (IN FRENCH)
Did you enjoy our music

JAY answers in French
JAY (IN FRENCH)

Yes I enjoyed the song very much

SINGER (IN FRENCH)
It’s a song about love

JAY (IN FRENCH)
Love is universal like death
JAY nods to the band who start playing again and rides
after SILAS
EXT - DRY LAKE DEAD TREE FLOWERS - DAY 13
The Sun bakes the land JAY and SILAS keep heading WEST
SILAS SELLECK (V0O)
The kid was a wonder He saw things
differently To him we were ina
land of hope and good will The way
I saw it kick over any rock and
most likely a desperado would crawl
out and knife you right in the

heart if there was a dollar in it

CUT TO

EXT - RIDGE OVERLOOKING DRIED RIVER BED - DAY 14
A rag-tag posse of seven men and a woman all on horseback
form a row and watch a distant SILAS and JAY cross the river

black hair and beard

A Dylan-esque musician ‘THE MINSTREL’ with a feather in his
hat and a banjo strapped to his back

half smile

bullet shells with fresh gunpowder

JAY
Same stars Same moon

SILAS ignores him
JAY (CONTD)
One day we’ll be wandering ‘round

JAY brings his gun out and stays still for a BEAT

SILAS emerges from the shadows

SILAS picks up Jay’s rabbit bones and throws them into the
fire

SILAS (CONTD)
This is the last time I’m gonna
clean up your shit

SILAS sits back up against the tree places his rifle on his
lap and covers himself with a blanket

and quietly un-cocks his gun

bridge

Mid day sun beating down the familiar red-tailed hawk
screech

SILAS and JAY walk their horses up through a yellowish rocky
canyon

The canyon narrows forming a pass a couple of yards wide

A buffalo has got trapped in the narrow gap and died there

It has been picked clean of meat down to its gleaming white

bones
The skeleton blocks the route WEST
JAY and SILAS approach
JAY
Must have been winter when Rose
passed through here
They begin to pull the heavy bones from between the rock

JAY lifts up the skull

SILAS
What’s she like

JAY perks up
JAY
She’s a beauty And She does not
waste words They tumble out wit
following wisdom

SILAS
You haven’t bedded her have you

SILAS laughs

JAY shakes his head

SILAS gestures to the buffalo rib cage

board fixed to the wall

SILAS turns to make sure JAY is out of sight then checks all
the notices

Amongst a number of wanted posters of grim faced outlaws a
wanted poster for ROSE ROSS and JOHN ROSS

Beneath a drawing of JOHN and ROSE a crude likeness reads -
JOHN ROSS and his daughter ROSE ROSS - ‘WANTED FOR MURDER -
REWARD 2000 DEAD OR ALIVE’

SILAS rips the poster from the board

SILAS SELLECK (VO)
Everyone knew about the bounty
except Jay He was leading me right
to it

The trading post door swings open and a man exits SILAS
turns his head

This is VICTOR THE HAWK - He is wearing a priest’s get-up
white dog collar black suit black hat perfectly groomed
Everything about this man is long sharp and clean

VICTOR carries a long black case about the length of a large
rifle and probably containing a large rifle

For a brief moment he stops and looks at SILAS A beat of
recognition between both men SILAS looks down at the case
VICTOR knows he knows A bounty hunter can smell another
bounty hunter

VICTOR tips his hat walks off mounts horse rides off

SILAS SELLECK (VO)
There were few of us left men
beyond the law

This is dreadful news
A race extinct their culture
banished their places re-named
only then will they be viewed with
selective nostalgia mythologised
and romanticised in the safe guise
of art And literature

Werner holds up the journal on ‘literature’
WERNER (CONTD)

This is a new world for us also
for them

Sun setting light fading
WERNER gets up walks towards his wagon

WERNER (CONT’D)
You must be hungry

He roots around the back of the wagon He has all sorts in
there about four saddles many bags much junk

He finds some bread and brings it to JAY

JAY
‘Til now my sole company’s been a
brute

WERNER

Sorry to hear this

JAY
I escaped

WERNER hands JAY bread sits back down
JAY takes a bite of bread

JAY (CONTD)
Thank you

CUT TO

EXT - WERNER CAMP - NIGHT 33
Camp surrounded by blackness

JAY and WERNER lit by the fire the back of WERNER’s wagon
lit by a lamp

JAY
I killed a woman yesterday

WERNER
Part and parcel

WERNER warms his hands by the flames
JAY
You care not to share your company

with a murderer

WERNER
Id be a lonely man if I did

WERNER shakes his head

WERNER (CONT ’D)
I am no Judge nor Father

WERNER now looks devilish in the light of the flames
WERNER (CONTD)
In a short time this will be a
long time ago
Distant wolves howl

WERNER picks up his rifle and stands up

WERNER (CONT’D)
Camp here Blanket

JAY nods

JAY
Thank you

WERNER returns to the back of the wagon and pulls out a
blanket brings it to JAY

WERNER
I shall dream up some advice and in
the morning dish it up with fresh

eggs
JAY
What’s your name
WERNER
Werner
JAY
I’m Jay Good night and thank you
Werner

WERNER nods turns climbs into the back of his wagon and
shuts the doors

JAY alone under the vast starry sky

EXT - PLAINS - DAWN 34
When JAY wakes up in the morning he is more than alone again

WERNER has gone and taken JAY’S horse all JAY’s
possessions clothes everything

JAY sits up in his all-in-one long Johns and looks around
Stands up

Looks down a chicken egg sits on a note

Picks up the egg the note flaps along the ground

JAY runs after it grabs the note and reads

NOTE- “West” and a arrow

JAY looks at the arrow west and turns round with the paper in
his hand before realising the joke of having an arrow west
drawn

JAY throws the note to the wind angry and amused in equal
measure

Drapes the blanket over his shoulder

Tries to peal the shell from the egg

Picks up a small stone to chip the egg shell and the egg
breaks but it is raw not boiled and drips to the ground
EXT - PLAINS - MORNING 35
JAY wanders across the vast windy plain

CUT TO

EXT - PLAINS - DAY 36
JAYs now staggering hungry tired
He spots a few mushrooms sprouting from the dust

He throws himself to the ground dramatically like he hasn’t
eaten for a week

Sniffs the mushrooms

The wind blowing hard has prevented JAY from hearing a horse
approach from behind him

The shadow of the man on the horse slides over JAY

JAY turns round to see SILAS and he has JAYS horse in tow
possessions intact

SILAS (0S)
You can eat those

SILAS nods at the mushrooms
SILAS (CONT’D)
Eat enough of them you can fly to
Rose

JAY looks at his horse and looks at SILAS

JAY
You kill Werner

SILAS takes time to shape his answer

SILAS
No No reason
JAY goes to his horse and brings out his wallet from his suit
Pulls out the rest of his money and holds it out to SILAS
JAY
This is all the money I have Get
me there in one piece

SILAS takes the money

SILAS
Sure kid

SILAS hands JAY a biscuit

SILAS (CONTD)
Have a biscuit

JAY munches it fast

CUT TO

EXT - PLAIN - DAY 37
SILAS and JAY ride across the plain towards a forest

CUT TO

EXT - FOREST - DAY 38

SILAS and JAY have stopped and are looking at something in
the woods

JAY
Thats a shame

SILAS
Is it

We see what they are looking at

A tree has been chopped down and fallen on top of the feller
completely squishing him

His arms stick out as if a cartoon his flesh long gone his
clothes disintegrating his skeleton hand still grasps the
axe

JAY
No No its not

Both men smile at each other

Nothing like someone elses misfortune to bond a friendship
JAY (CONTD)
Charles Darwin talks of ‘evolution
by natural selection’

SILAS
For our sake lets hope hes wrong

CUT TO

EXT - WOODS - DAY 39
The men ride on SILAS is riding in front of JAY
JAY is singing
JAY
My lord is hunting he has gone
hounds and hawks with him are none
beyond Silverghost lies his game

Rose Ross is her name

SILAS puts on his jacket for no reason other than to bring
out the ROSE and JOHN ROSS Wanted poster

SILAS checks that JAY is not looking (JAY is not)

SILAS looks at the drawing of ROSE flips it over and looks
at the 2000 flips it back to ROSE then pockets it

EXT - CAMP BY RIVER IN FOREST - DAY TO EVENING 40
A pretty clearing in the forest dappled light through trees
a gentle trickling stream a campfire crackling logs laid
out for sitting a kettle boiling

JAY sits on a log

SILAS approaches him while sharpening a large hunting knife

SILAS walks behind JAY holding the knife up

SILAS
The knifes got to be as sharp as a
razor

JAYs face has been lathered up with soap the irony is JAY
is still too young for even the hint of stubble

SILAS (CONT’D)
You hold the knife flush against
the skin

SILAS holds the knife flush against JAYs throat

SILAS (CONTD)
And its a scraping motion against
the grain not a slicing motion

SILAS scrapes the knife up the side of JAYS face and wipes
the soap on a cloth over his shoulder

SILAS (CONT’D)
Like so We gotta make you
presentable for her

JAY smiles at this

JAY
I know why you need my help

SILAS pauses

SILAS
Oh yeah

JAY
Yeah - You’re lonely You’re a
lonely man

The truth throws SILAS for a beat

SILAS
Sure kid

JAY
Sure kid Lets drift The silent
lonely drifter

SILAS continues to shave JAY

JAY (CONTD)
Youre a lonely lonely man

SILAS
No need to concern over me

SILAS places the blade on JAY
JAY flinches

SILAS (CONTD)
Hold still

JAY
All I’m saying is Theres more to
life than just surviving

SILAS
Yeah - theres dyin’ Survival
aint jus’ how to skin a jack-
rabbit

(MORE)

SILAS (CONTD)
Its knowing when to bluster and
when to hush When to take a
beatin’ and when to strike

JAY
Wheres your folks

SILAS
Fathers in the ground in Ireland
Mothers in the ground in Canada

JAY
So what keeps you from joining
them
SILAS snaps
SILAS

I dunno kid quit askin’ me shit
JAY smiles

SILAS (CONT’D)
I was fine ‘til you showed up

JAY
I showed up You showed up

SILAS
Yeah well maybe I’m tired of
showin’ up

A distant noise like tinkling of glasses

SILAS stops shaving JAY half finished and looks to the
trees brings out his gun and cocks it

SILAS (CONT’D)
You’re done

SILAS slowly walks across camp towards the noise gun pointed

A man wanders into view - PAYNE - we remember him as the
leader of the posse watching JAY and SILAS ride days back

We especially remember because PAYNE wears an enormous fur
coat

PAYNE is a generation older than SILAS and a generation
wilder

PAYNE chomps on a cigar (bigger than SILAS’s cigar) carries
a couple of glasses in one hand (source of the clinking) and
a bottle of absinthe in the other

PAYNE pauses for dramatic effect unbothered by Silas and his
gun

PAYNE holds his hands out wide as he does a balletic turn
walking into the middle of the camp
Another dramatic pause removes cigar

PAYNE
May I enter

SILAS
Its a free country

PAYNE
Try telling the natives that

PAYNE playful SILAS wary JAY entertained
PAYNE (CONT’D)
I propose a trade A mug of coffee
for the finest imported absinthe
and a cigar of unrivaled quality

JAY
We drink tea

PAYNE ignores JAY

PAYNE pulls out a couple of cigars from his belt hands one
to SILAS and one to JAY

PAYNE
One for you young man

PAYNE SILAS JAY all move to the logs by the fie and sit in
a triangle

PAYNE pours three glasses of absinthe as he checks SILAS out

PAYNE (CONTD)
Still not a mark on you

JAY confused

JAY
You know him

SILAS smiles

SILAS
Fuck yourself Payne

PAYNE smiles
PAYNE
I’ve tried Believe me I have

tried

PAYNE takes a swig of the tea JAY has poured him

PAYNE (CONTD)
Oh Thats damn fine coffee

JAY
Its tea

PAYNE passes an absinthe to SILAS and to JAY stands and
toasts

PAYNE
To bad times in the green hour

SILAS downs JAY sips
PAYNE (CONTD)
Down it boy its liquid joy
PAYNE casually to JAY

PAYNE (CONT’D)
So you headed West

SILAS interrupts quick before JAY can answer

SILAS
North

They are all lying to each other and they all know it

PAYNE
Yeah I’m headed South The
chill I can’t stand it - Makes my
joints ache

PAYNE moves his finger like hes pulling an invisible trigger
and makes a threatening squeaky sound moving in close to
JAY and re-fills his glass

PAYNE (CONTD)
So why north kid Someone special
You’re sweetheart maybe

Now SILAS moves in close and gives JAY the ‘don’t answer’
stare

PAYNE breaks the tension
PAYNE (CONTD)
Hey I’m teasing I’m teasing You
must be born on a Sunday eh You
born on a Sunday

JAY just shakes his head

PAYNE (CONT’D)
You born on a Sunday

JAY
I don’t know
SILAS now very alert to PAYNEs line of questioning
PAYNE
So its fortunate that you’re
headed North because West its

bad big trouble big storm coming

SILAS decides to cut this quick

SILAS
Easy Payne Hes just a kid
PAYNE
No hes not Hes an outlaw just

like us
This saddens SILAS but pleases JAY
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Any-hoo Lets drink To friends
old And new

They all down another absinthe but SILAS and JAY have drunk
way more than PAYNE

PAYNE made sure of that

CUT TO

EXT - CAMP BY RIVER - NIGHT 41
An empty bottle of Absinthe on its side - lit by the moon
PAYNE sits on a log watching SILAS and JAY

SILAS is showing JAY how to draw and cock his gun quickly
and SILAS half-cut is still pretty handy

SILAS shows JAY how to spin his gun round his finger

SILAS
Spin it

JAY tries to copy but drops the gun
The nozzle lands and sticks in the dirt

SILAS (CONT’D)
Thats pretty good

A swaying JAY leans down and picks up the gun the nozzle now
packed with mud

SILAS (CONTD)
Get that dirt out of it Clean it

JAY tries to clean it with his cuff then looks directly down
the barrel of the gun

JAY stumbles over to a tree and taps the gun against the
trunk

The gun goes of with a loud bang and JAY drops it and falls
over

This amuses SILAS greatly and he celebrates by firing his own
gun into the air

PAYNE is sitting back against a tree his face in shadow
watching JAY and SILAS unravel

PAYNE shakes his head

The plan to get SILAS and JAY drunk and talking is failing
now they are too drunk

JAY
I need to piss

SILAS flaps his gun in the direction of the forest (same path
as PAYNE came from top of scene)

SILAS
Away from camp

JAY wanders into the dark

PAYNE waits a beat until JAY has gone

Stares at SILAS

PAYNE

Easy see how you two crossed paths
Ones a falling angel the others
a rising devil

PAYNE walks towards SILAS

SILAS staggers towards PAYNE

SILAS
I’m no angel

As SILAS tries to step over a log catches his foot and falls
hard to the ground with a thump

PAYNE
True

PAYNE helps SILAS to his feet

The men embrace
SILAS using PAYNE to balance PAYNE holding SILAS close

PAYNE (CONTD)
You think thats a smart play -
teaming up with him - quicker than
trackin’ him - simpler

SILAS
Ain’t no play about it

PAYNE
Yeah I guess if you knew where
Rose and daddy was you’d be done
babysittin’
SILAS stays quiet
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Never was a bean-spiller was ya
Not sober nor liquored up never
was
SILAS stays quiet the men still holding each other close
PAYNE (CONT’D)
What you gonna do with two thousand
dollars
PAYNE places both hands on SILAS’ shoulders

PAYNE (CONT’D)
Come back to us

SILAS loses patience pulls out his gun cocks it and pushes
the nozzle into PAYNEs belly

SILAS
I’m not like you Payne

PAYNE gets it takes a step back and another and another
and keeps walking backwards into the darkness

CUT TO

EXT - NIGHT - FOREST 42

JAY is deep in the forest taking a piss lit by the light of
the moon

Turns and heads through the trees seeing the flames from a
camp fire

JAY
Silas

EXT - FOREST - ANOTHER CAMP - NIGHT 43

He trips and stumbles into the camp then freezes and looks
about

A group of ten folk sit round the fire JAY recognises none
of them

(We recognise this posse They are PAYNEs posse from the
ridge)

They all look up at JAY
THE KID SKELLY PEYOTE JOE THE MINSTREL TATTOO MAN
MARIMACHO with the TWO SWEDISH KIDS from the trading post

THE KID stands up knife in hand itching to leap on JAY and
cut him up

JAY
What have ye done with SILAS and
PAYNE

Sitting next to THE KID SKELLY oldest of the gang and 2nd
in charge after PAYNE

Nudges THE KID
SKELLY
Back down kid Payne needs him

THE KID reluctantly obeys and sits back down in a huff

JAY confused not realising hes wandered the wrong way and
entered the wrong camp

JAY
What have you done with the river

PEYOTE JOE bulging crazy eyes from way too much Peyote
answers JAY with an ominous tone

PEYOTE JOE
They took it

JAY sits down in the circle of folk between TATTOO MAN and
PEYOTE JOE

The SWEDISH GIRL watches him recognising him from the
trading post

JAY doesnt recognise her

JAY turns to PEYOTE JOE

JAY
Who took it

PEYOTE JOE
Didn’t see their faces

MARIMACHO sees the SWEDISH GIRL stare at JAY

MARIMACHO
Kid

The SWEDISH GIRL breaks her stare and obeys MARIMACHO
crawling under a blanket with her brother

MARIMACHO tucks them in

SKELLY sitting next to THE KID on the opposite side of the
fire to JAY continues a conversation

SKELLY
All I’m sayin’ is in my day we
tried to keep out o’ the papers
You youngsters tryin’ to get in em
makes no sense

THE KID
And all I’m sayin’ Skell is I
want folks to respec’ me Whats

SKELLY spits a gob of chewed tobacco into the fire and looks
around at his audience and clears his throat

SKELLY
I partnered with a youngling once
upon a time by the name of Bill
Allson Dying to be famous
actually killing to be famous
Come to me one time and he said

EXT - WILD WEST STREET - BRIGHT HOT DAY 44

A stereotypical Wild West street a younger SKELLY (teeth in

BILL ALLSON is cut from the same cloth as THE KID new
generation cowboy good-looking cocky swagger fame-seeking

The men walk and talk

(SKELLY is still telling the story but the characters mouth
the words)

BILL ALLSON (SKELLYS VO)
“I killed thirty men and countless
savages and I still ain’t got me
no wanted poster”

SKELLY (SARCASTIC)
Wheres the justice in that I says

Its a one horse town and it looks deserted dream-like

The men approach a makeshift wooden shack operating as the
town saloon

SKELLY (V0O)
So I’m thinking the only way to
stop this kid croakin’ more
innocents is to draw up a poster
Let him find it

A hand draws a wanted poster - BILL ALLISON WANTED 500
DEAD OR ALIVE its a crude poster badly drawn

45 EXT - WILD WEST STREET - DAY 45

SKELLY hammers up the wanted poster on the outside wall of
the saloon

SKELLY (VO)
The next morning I put the poster
outside the waterin’ hole he was
drownin’ in Wasn’t long afore he

sees the poster - “BILL ALLSON 500
DOLLARS DEAD OR ALIVE” He yells me
over

BILL ALLSON looking at the poster

falls to his knees and dies

Bullshit

MARIMACHO smiles

MARIMACHO
Thats a good ‘un Skelly
Most agree with mumbles
JAY rouses out of the story and the silence sobers him up
He looks around the camp now alarmed
JAY
Theres been an appalling
misunderstanding I’m at the wrong
camp
JAY scrambles to his feet

JAY (CONTD)
Good night - good riddance

JAY runs off into the darkness
A gentle strum of a banjo and THE MINSTREL begins to sing

THE KID now standing again drops his knife into the dirt in
anger

(To the tune of One man went to mow)

THE MINSTREL
The good Lord brings the rain
To wash away our troubles
The devil adds the lightning
To show us hes still near
So the good Lord sends some thunder
To warn us of the devil
But devils gonna blow us all
away

EXT - CAMP IN FOREST BY RIVER - NIGHT 53

JAY stares at SILAS excitement becomes anger

JAY
Fighting talk

JAY tries to hit SILAS but SILAS just smothers JAYs actions
as he tries to calm him

SILAS
Shhh

JAY calms sobbing
SILAS lays him down on his blanket like a baby

JAY cries

JAY

Youre always shushing me
SILAS

Cos you’re always running your

mouth off
A loud crack of thunder
JAYS gun on the ground

Ants are marching into the barrel as the first drops of rain
hit the ground

Massive thunder crack and a flash of lightning

JAY out cold we enter his absinthe fueled dreams

INT - PIONEER HOUSE - EVENING 54
A basic wooden room walls painted white a table and chair
Nothing else looks like a stage set

The only light source is a candle on the table

Rose sits on a chair at the table reading a book by the
candle light

Two windows on the wall behind ROSE but instead of glass
paper semi-transparent oiled paper

Slowly and theatrically lights fade up from outside glowing
through paper windows

JAY is slumped against the opposite wall Rose does not see
him JAY is the sole audience to this strange ‘play’

He smiles as he sees ROSE

A distant crack of thunder and SILAS enters the room from a
door on the right smiles at Rose

JAY stops smiling looks confused then upset

SILAS sits at the table with ROSE and starts to read a
newspaper

ROSE gets up and approaches JAY (POV CAMERA) leans in and
picks up a baby

The baby is crying
ROSE sits back down and rocks the baby

ROSE
Jay-bird why so sad

SILAS smiles
Suddenly rain and thunder sound
From somewhere (reality not dream) we hear JAY shouting

JAY
Silas

The lights dim on the dream scene

CUT TO

EXT - DAWN - CAMP BY RIVER 55
SILAS wakes up - (note - the audience is led to believe this
was JAYs dream it begins as JAYS dream as we cut back to
reality with SILAS waking we may presume this is also SILAS
dream)

SILAS wakes up

JAY shouting

Dawn throws light on an unexpected and chaotic state of
affairs

Thunder crashes lightning is flashes heavy rain falls in
sheets

The river has burst its banks and the camp has become the
river

The water is up to SILAS’ waist as he sits upright against a
tree

Food clothing blankets equipment all float around them
and down the river

SILAS leaps up
JAY looks for his gun

JAY
Silas I can’t find my gun

SILAS looks down at his now empty holster then runs to the
side of the tree where he left his rifle now just an empty
case

SILAS
Son of a Bitch

PAYNE has stolen all their weapons
They splash around grabbing their gear
Each lightening flare reveals a fresh tableau of chaos

JAYS book ‘Ho for the West’ slowly revolves as it floats off
down the river

CUT TO

EXT - VAST PLAIN - MORNING 56

A vast plain

In the distance a forest beyond the forest a mountain range
on the mountain a storm distant cracking of thunder faint
flashes of lightning

This is the storm SILAS and JAY are in and it looks about a
days ride from the middle of the plain

The plain on the other hand is backing hot clear blue
skies

A house sits in the middle of the plain freshly built
bright yellow pine oiled paper not glass on the window

JOHN ROSS stands on the porch of the house he has just built

JOHN looks at the distant storm and shakes his head - he
needs the storm to be here to water his crops

He turns to watch a figure walk slowly towards him across the
plain

This is KOTORI a young handsome Native American dressed in
settler’ shirt and trousers

KOTORI carries two large jack rabbits has a rifle over his
shoulder holds up the rabbits

JOHN nods and smiles

JOHN ROSS
Come in Kotori
CUT TO
INT - PIONEER HOME - DAY 57

The Ross house is simply constructed whitewashed wood
walls paper windows we may recognise the room from JAYs
dream during the flood

Now it is furnished - simple furniture mad from pine- a
dresser a table chairs a bed

The dresser has plates apples bottles of milk glasses

There is also a milk churn other objects of use for daily
life far from any store

There is a rifle on two nails above the door a single bed in
the far corner (Johns) a door leading to a tiny room where
Rose sleeps - and in the back a small larder full of food and
utensils and a back door

ROSE is now dressed in trousers and shirt more practical
making her look more grown up her platted hair makes her
more ‘American’

ROSE ROSS picks up a butter mould and carries it across the
room

She pauses mid stride as she hears KOTORI approach - she is
very alert

KOTORI enters ROSE smiles

ROSE
Kotori

She takes the jackrabbits from him and hangs them up on a
nail in the back larder

JOHN enters and sits down at the table with KOTORI
ROSE pours her father a cup of coffee

JOHN ROSS (SARCASTIC)
Turned out nice again

ROSE turns

KOTORI
Coffee

ROSE turns back and pours Kotori a coffee
ROSE
You always ask for coffee and you

always spit it out

ROSE slowly lifts the top of the butter mould but the butter
has not set and sinks out in a yellow splodge onto the table

ROSE (CONT’D)
For Gods sake

JOHN ROSS
Language Rose

ROSE scrapes up the butter

JOHN ROSS (CONT’D)
An improvement stayed on the table

They exchange smiles

CUT TO

EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY 58
Meanwhile
SILAS and JAY are out of the woods and on a grass meadow

Their drenched worldly goods are spread out on the grass

SILAS sits on his saddle and pours water from his boot

JAY wrings out his suit jacket

SILAS tries to spit his dry mouth producing a dribble down
his chin

SILAS
Only thing drys my mouth

SILAS places a soggy cigar in his mouth

JAY
My head is killing me

SILAS looks at JAY a testing intense look

SILAS
You remember nothing from last
night

JAY

I remember Payne Then rain
SILAS unravels a knotted rope

JAY looks at all the wet gear looks at SILAS looks at the
rope

JAY (CONTD)
Give me that rope

SILAS throws the rope to JAY

CUT TO

SILAS and JAY are riding across the meadow with a rope tied
like a washing line stretched between the two horses

To keep the rope taught they ride about fifteen feet apart

All their wet gear is tied to the rope enabling them to dry
while they ride

Both men ride in their long-johns
It is both practical and ridiculous
SILAS smiles at JAY

SILAS
Not bad kid

First compliment and JAY acts cool but smiles to himself
They ride into the sunset but this is not the end

CUT TO

EXT - RIDGE - DAY 59

PAYNE and his gang appear on the lip of the ridge and stop
looking down the hill

They are about 500 yards behind JAY and SILAS who have
dismounted and are at the bottom of the hill

SILAS SELLECK (V0O)
I must have been Jays age when I
joined Paynes gang

PAYNE’s gang watch as SILAS and JAY stop at the edge of a
forest at the bottom of the hill

SILAS SELLECK (VO)
Those were prosperous times in our
trade When I split I was lucky to
do so with my life

This forest is Silverghost the forest JAY paid SILAS to get
him too so they must be close to ROSE now

In fact on the far side of the forest is a plain and on the
plain sits a house and in that house ROSE JOHN and KOTORI

SILAS turns and looks back up the hill his fears confirmed
when he sees PAYNE and his posse at the top of the hill

JAY turns to see the posse

JAY
What do they want

SILAS
They’re bounty hunters You know
what that means

JAY
They hunt bounty

SILAS rummages in his saddlebag and pulls out the wanted
poster

SILAS
They hunt Rose Daddy Blood Money

SILAS passes JAY the poster now sodden from the flood and
breaking apart

JAY takes a long hard look at the drawing of ROSE and at the
words DEAD or ALIVE

JAY
Wanted Dead or

SILAS
Dead or dead kid

JAY takes a BEAT to process

JAY
And I’m leading them to her

JAY passes the poster back to SILAS

JAY (CONTD)
We’ll lead them South

SILAS shakes his head

SILAS
There will be others

JAY
Others

SILAS

Two thousand dollars entices a
certain breed of undesirable

JAY takes a good hard look at SILAS

JAY
And just what breed are you

SILAS thinks about striking JAY but changes his mind
He mounts his horse looking into the forest

Silverghost is a silver birch forest white trees and green
leaves make it look inviting

SILAS
Local tribes call this forest ‘the
place of spirit trees’ trappers
call it ‘Silverghost’ - Legend has
it folks go in they don’t come
out

JAY climbs on his pony
SILAS (CONTD)
Least we may shed the superstitious

from PAYNES company

PAYNE and his company still stand in a row at the top of the
hill

SILAS and JAY their horses still tied together with the
washing line ride into the forest

EXT - TOP OF THE HILL - DAY 60

VICTOR (V0O)

Sorry to bother you looking for a

JOHN opens the door to VICTOR
VICTOR removes his hat it is the very same man SILAS saw
outside the trading post Hawklike features black suit

This is the sharp shooting bounty hunter VICTOR THE HAWK

VICTOR
James Parker

JOHN takes a second to think
JOHN
No Parkers here minister won’t you

JOHN opens the door wide revealing to VICTOR’S POV ROSE
standing pointing the rifle at him

VICTOR
Sir I thank you but decline
VICTOR nods behind JOHN
JOHN turns to see ROSE pointing the gun at VICTOR
JOHN lunges at ROSE and grabs the gun

JOHN ROSS
Rose

JOHN ROSS places the gun back up on the nails above the door

JOHN ROSS (CONTD)
I’m sorry minister

VICTOR smiles

VICTOR
The Good Lord has me on an errand -
Bless you and your lovely wife

JOHN ROSS
My daughter

VICTOR
Ah Good day sir

VICTOR places his hat back on his head turns and walks off

JOHN ROSS walks onto the porch ROSE follows they both stand
staring at VICTOR as he rides off

JOHN ROSS
Heavens above Rose Scotland is far
far away Nobody knows where we
are Nobody knows who we are

ROSE
He knows I’m your daughter I’m
called Rose And he knows we’re
here

JOHN ROSS
He was sent by providence The Lord
sensed my wavering faith Rain is
coming

JOHN ROSS turns and walks into the house leaving ROSE on the
porch to watch VICTOR ride into the distance

She knows trouble is coming
ROSE turns into the house and shuts the door

CUT TO

EXT - SILVER BIRCH FOREST - DAY 62

JAY and SILAS wind through the silver birch trees of
Silverghost

The forest

is oddly quiet lacking of bird song or the chirp

of crickets

JAY and SILAS are still in their long johns and have
forgotten about the washing line - their clothes now dragging
along the ground

JAY
Thou shall not be afraid of any
terror of night nor for the arrow
that flyeth by day For the
pestilence that waketh in Darkness
nor for the sickness that
destroyeth in the noon day (Psalm
of David)

SILAS responds

SILAS
“Oer all there hung the shadow of
fear a sense of mystery the spirit
daunted and said as plain as a
whisper in the ear this place is
haunted (page 200 Ambrose Bearce)

JAY is taken aback by SILAS sudden poetic knowledge

CUT TO

EXT - CLEARING IN THE SILVER BIRCH FOREST - DAY 63

SILAS now

back in dry trousers picks up his shirt from the

washing line rope and shakes the leaves from it We see the

rope still
JAY thinks
He wanders

A superbly
the string

ties the two horses together
he sees something move in the trees
into the middle of the clearing

camouflaged figure in between the trees pulls back
of a bow

JAY sees the movement but not the figure

JAY
Silas The trees are moving

SILAS turns to look but sees nothing

SILAS
It’s called a hangover kid You’1l
get used to it

The figure a NATIVE AMERICAN is painted to look like a
silver birch tree

His bow is drawn and his arrow points at JAY

His tribe must be the reason why ‘men come in to Silverghost
don’t come out’

The arrow is released with a whizz
JAY instinctively raises his hands to cover his face

The arrow shoots right through the palm of JAY’s hand and
stops an inch before his forehead

JAY holds up his hand with the arrow stuck clean through it
First disbelief then panic then pain
SILAS wanders over

Behind SILAS and JAY TWO MORE NATIVES dart from the trees
and leap on their horses and gallop past SILAS and JAY

SILAS and JAY can only watch

The washing line rope is still tied between the horses and
drags along the ground

The NATIVES pass each side of a tree the rope snaps tight
around the base of the trunk bringing the horses to an
abrupt stop and trowing the natives into the air

One lands with a roll and runs off in disbelief the other
smacks into a tree and lands with a thud and is knocked out
cold

SILAS and JAY can’t quite believe what they’ve seen saved by
the rope

The NATIVE who fired the arrow at JAY cannot believe it
either not seeing the rope and thinking magic involved he
drops his bow and arrow and runs off into the forest

JAY grabs SILAS the arrow in the hand still a slight issue
SILAS smiles

SILAS (CONTD)
Nice catch

SILAS snaps the head off the arrow and pulls the remaining
arrow out

JAY yelps in pain
SILAS pats JAY on the back

SILAS (CONT’D)
Well fix you up on the way

CUT TO

EXT - WHEATFIELD IN FRONT OF PIONEER HOUSE - DAY 64

In front of the Ross house is a small golden wheatfield
about a hundred meters square

In the middle stands a ragged scarecrow

At the back of the wheatfield crouched low facing the house
is VICTOR THE HAWK

He opens the long case (SILAS noted at the trading post) and
in it a long rifle snug in red velvet and a neat row of
bullets

This rifle has a sight attached for distance shooting

VICTOR gently lifts the rifle up and looks across the field

About fifty yards to the left of the house JOHN ROSS is
building a fence

Two posts are up and JOHN ROSS is nailing up a cross spar
VICTOR places a bullet in the chamber of the rifle

JOHN ROSS lifts the long piece of wood up and hammers in a
nail fixing the spar a post

The sun is beating down hard

VICTOR gages the distance between himself and JOHN ROSS while
adjusting the sights and aiming

JOHN ROSS sweating removes his hat and stares up at the sun

VICTOR is about to pull the trigger until a sound of the
house door opening stops him

ROSE and KOTORI appear and run about fifty yards to the right
of the house (JOHN ROSS is to the left) There is a washing

line with sheets flapping in the breeze and a pony tied to a
post

KOTORI helps ROSE up onto the pony

VICTOR looks at ROSE looks at JOHN ROSS looks at ROSE

CUT TO

EXT - SILVER BIRCH FOREST - DAY 65
SILAS and JAY wind through the silver birch

JAYs hand is now wrapped in a dirty bloody rag

They ride out of the forest and onto a plain and stop

JAY jumps down from his pony and walks out onto the plain

In the distance a house a washing line a wheatfield too
far to see people but it is the Ross house and ROSE is
riding and JOHN ROSS is mending the fence and VICTOR is
crouched at the back of the field but from JAY’s view it

looks peaceful and beautiful

JAY
I’ve made it

SILAS is behind JAY still on his horse

SILAS
Are you sure that’s them

JAY ignores SILAS and lets out a relieved sigh

JAY
Exactly what I imagined

As JAY looks towards the house SILAS dismounts unhooks the
rope from the saddle and walks towards JAY

SILAS has made a small loop in the end of the rope and he
loops it over JAYS hand pulls the loop tight and grabs JAY
by the scruff of his neck

JAY (CONTD)
Hey

SILAS drags JAY backwards JAY struggling falls to the
ground and is dragged along the ground on his back

JAY (CONTD)
Silas Silas SILAS what are you
doing Stop no Silas

SILAS hauls JAY up against the nearest silver birch tree on
the edge of the plain moves behind JAY and passes the rope
around the trunk and ties his hands together

JAY is sitting his back up against the trunk wriggling and
spitting with rage

SILAS behind JAY pulls out his large hunting knife

JAY sees the knife stops wriggling places his head against
the tree shuts his eyes

JAY thinks Silas is about to slit his throat

JAY (CONTD)
Do it quick

SILAS looks at JAY incredulously

SILAS
I aint going to kill you

SILAS cuts the long end of the rope beyond the knot

SILAS (CONTD)
I’m keeping you alive We don’t
have a gun between us

SILAS walks around and sits in front of JAY rubs the tree
above JAYS head and the white powder of the silver birch
rubs off onto SILAS’S hand

SILAS grabs the back of JAYS head

SILAS (CONTD)
Hold still

SILAS rubs the white powder over JAY’s face

JAY
What is this

SILAS
Stops the sun burning you up

JAY rages

JAY
Ill protect Rose or die trying

SILAS turns and walks to his horse

SILAS
That’s what I’m afraid of
JAY (YELLS)
Lay a finger on her and I’11 kill

you

SILAS ignores JAY grabs the reins of JAY’S horse climbs
onto his horse

JAY throws himself into a rage
JAY wriggles dribbles

Begins to rub the rope up and down the back of the tree

SILAS gallops off with both horses across the plain in the
direction of the Ross house

CUT TO

EXT - BACK OF WHEATFIELD - DAY (VICTOR) 66
ROSE and KOTORI walk slowly back to the house

VICTOR keeps them in the sights of his rifle his finger on
the trigger

-But first his view is blocked by the washing line then by
the scarecrow then ROSE and KOTORI enter the house and shut
the door

VICTOR lowers his rifle

VICTOR looks back towards JOHN ROSS and lifts his rifle and
has JOHN ROSS in his sights again

JOHN ROSS picks up a couple of nails from a little wooden
box places one nail between his teeth and begins to hammer
the other one into the fence

VICTOR steadies himself holds his breath and his rifle
stills

A nail is hammered into wood
Sweat drips from the rim of JOHN ROSS’s hat

As the hammer strikes the head of the nail VICTOR pulls the
trigger a loud bang echoes across the plain

JOHN ROSS’S hammer falls to the ground

INT - PIONEER HOUSE - DAY - (ROSE) 67
Inside the house ROSE hears the bang

She stops what she’s doing and listens the echo of the
gunshot still audible

EXT - TREE ON EDGE OF PLAIN - DAY - (JAY) 68

JAY frantically rubbing also hears the shot and freezes

EXT - EDGE OF WHEATFIELD - DAY - (VICTOR) 69

VICTOR lowers his gun and in the distance JOHN ROSS falls
to the ground

EXT - MIDDLE OF PLAIN - DAY - (SILAS)

SILAS gallops fast towards the house JAY’s horse galloping

EXT - EDGE OF WHEAT FIELD - DAY - (VICTOR)

VICTOR now standing puts his jacket on brushes himself
down looking towards the house

CUT TO

EXT - TREE EDGE OF PLAIN - DAY - (JAY)

As JAY rubs the rope against the tree we hear voices from
behind him in the forest

A general mumble of stories being told jokes exchanged
horse trots twig snaps

JAY freezes and shuts his eyes

He is well hidden low down his shirt the colour of the
silver birch his face white with the dust from the bark

PAYNES posse slowly ride past JAY and out onto the plain no

one notices the boy tied to the tree

Chit-chatting away the last to pass JAY is the MINSTREL - he

whistles and strums a sad lament on his banjo

The posse are heading straight for the house

JAYS breathing quickens matters going from bad to
devastating

Once out of earshot JAY begins rubbing the rope with added
ferocity

CUT TO

EXT - WHEATFIELD - DAY - (VICTOR) 76

VICTOR walks through the wheatfield past the scarecrow
towards the ROSS house

-Until he notices SILAS galloping into view from the right
of the house

VICTOR ducks down into the wheat
SILAS rides to the back of the house

CUT TO

EXT - TREE EDGE OF PLAIN - DAY - (JAY) 77
JAY rubs about half of the rope frayed

PAYNE and his posse are half way between JAY and the ROSS
house

EXT - PORCH OF ROSS HOUSE - DAY - (SILAS) 78
SILAS runs around the building and onto the porch

SILAS
John Ross Rose Ross

SILAS bangs on the wall and the door

SILAS (CONTD)
You need to leave this house
There are men coming here to kill
you

To the left of the door a paper window - oiled and
translucent

Fingers rip a hole in the paper and ROSE’s eye appears
peeping at SILAS

SILAS is struck by ROSE’s beauty - even just the small
glimpse of an eye

SILAS (CONT’D)
Rose

Another burst in the paper window below the eye hole and a
gun barrel seductively slides out

SILAS holds his hands up and takes a step back and another

SILAS (CONTD)
Easy I’m a friend

ROSE’s eye moves she was looking at SILAS now her gaze
shifts to something behind and to the left of SILAS

The barrel of the gun also shifts round away from SILAS
SILAS turns to see what ROSE now looks and aims at

It is VICTOR in the field And he is aiming his rifle at
SILAS

VICTOR shoots
SILAS is hit on the shoulder and falls to the ground

ROSE’s eye disappears from the hole on the paper window

SILAS struggles to his feet and scrambles round the left hand
side of the house and falls

VICTOR quickly reloads

SILAS slumps against the wall of the house
VICTOR can still see SILAS’ legs sticking out
VICTOR shoots SILAS in the leg

SILAS gasps and shuffles along the wall so he is completely
out of sight

VICTOR again reloads

The scarecrow about twenty feet behind VICTOR is made of a
cross of wood with a ragged coat and a large hat

VICTOR aims his rifle waiting for SILAS to reappear
The scarecrow lifts its head and lowers its arms
It is PAYNE now wearing the hat of the scarecrow

PAYNE casually walks towards VICTOR and shoots him in the
back

VICTOR falls down dead

PAYNE takes aim high

He aims at the Native American weather vane that sits on top
of the house
PAYNE shoots the vane pings and spins
Settles WEST

PAYNE is happy about this and turns to shout an order to his
posse

PAYNE
Kill that house

The posse pop up from all around him like whack-a-mole
Shooting up the house

JAY stops rubbing and listens to the distant gun shots
starts to rub again faster than ever

CUT TO

INT - PIONEER HOUSE - DAY 80
ROSE is crouched below the paper window holding her pistol
Gun shots explode from outside

ROSE lifts herself up and looks out of the hole in the paper
she made with the gun barrel

Through the hole we see the posse pop up and down as they
fire at the house

KOTORI runs to ROSE and hauls her down from the window just
as a bullet explodes on the window frame inches from where
ROSE was

Dust and splinters rain down on ROSE and KOTORI

The inside of the house is being peppered by bullets

Bullets pepper the back wall A lamp is smashed off the wall

EXT - WHEAT FIELD - DAY 81
PAYNE stands still while his men pop up and down around him

PAYNE takes his hat of his head and holds it against his
chest in honor of the house near dead

INT - INSIDE PIONEER HOUSE - DAY 82
Bullets whizz through the paper windows

Plates are smashed from the dresser

EXT - SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY 83

SILAS inspects his shoulder wound then his leg wound

BULLETS whizz by him hitting the wall by his head but SILAS
does not flinch

In fact he smiles

INT - PIONEER HOUSE - DAY 84
More objects smash

A glass bottle of water

A porcelain statue

A jug of milk

A book (Pilgrims Progress)

An apple on a shelf

EXT - TREE ON EDGE OF PLAIN - DAY 85

A few strands left then a snap as JAY breaks the rope and
frees himself

He jumps up and runs towards the house

EXT - SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY 86
SILAS places a cigar in his mouth and digs into his pocket

He pulls out his last match which is used and dead

This upsets SILAS more than the whizzing bullets and bleeding
wounds

INT - PIONEER HOUSE - DAY 87

KOTORI moves to the door and brings down JOHN ROSS’s rifle
then bolts the door

ROSE sits under the window holding her pistol

Above ROSE a shadow of a large knife rests against the oiled
paper

An eye appears at the hole - the eye of the CHINESE MAN -
TATTOO MAN

The eye looks around the room ROSE out of sight below him

TATTOO MAN walks along the porch to the door and tries the
handle

Then passes along the porch to the other window
ROSE moves into the middle of the room
She aims at TATTOO MAN’S silhouette and fires

TATTOO’S bloody head bursts through the paper and slides
down leaving a bloody snail trail

ROSE runs back to below the window and ducks down

EXT - MIDDLE OF PLAIN - DAY 88

JAY runs fast towards the house

EXT - SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY 89

POSSE member - THE KID - slinks around the corner where SILAS
slumps but does not see SILAS

THE KID loads his gun

Bullets from the shooters in the field spray the walls around
him
THE KID
I’1l1 show em how to do the job
right - yes sir no sir three bags
full of Shhh

THE KID finally notices SILAS slumped unarmed unlit cigar
hanging out of his mouth

THE KID lifts his gun
SILAS resigned to death

A bullet whizzes from the field meant for the house but hits
the KID in the back

THE KID slides down the wall and rests next to SILAS

Lets out his last breath

INT - PIONEER HOUSE - DAY 90

The silhouette of PEYOTE JOE passes the far window on the
opposite side of the house

KOTORI spots him

He’s heading for the back door

KOTORI moves towards the back door

The door opens and KOTORI fires blasting PEYOTE JOE dead

JOE lies on the porch but immediate rigor mortis has frozen
his hand to the handle of the door

KOTORI can’t shut the door with JOE attached to the handle
ROSE joins KOTORI and the pull the door

As the door closes JOE is dragged along the back porch until
his trousers snag on a nail

ROSE and KOTORI heave the door shut and JOE’S trousers are
pulled down

ROSE and KOTORI run back to their positions below the windows
at the front of the house

EXT - SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY 91
SILAS roots through the pockets of THE KID and finds a box of
matches

EXT - MIDDLE OF PLAIN - DAY 92
JAY running slower due to exhaustion gunfire getting louder
as he nears the house

INT - PIONEER HOUSE - DAY 93
The gunfire suddenly stops

KOTORI looks out of the window at the field

The field looks completely peaceful and empty (the remaining
men are lying low)

It is a strange moment of quiet mid battle
ROSE sobs

KOTORI looks at ROSE then moves to her props his rifle next
to her and walks towards the back door

ROSE turns

ROSE
Kotori

ROSE thinks KOTORI is abandoning her and slumps back down
below the window

SILAS is slumped behind the wall to ROSE’s left

SILAS starts to sing and ROSE hears through the wall
SILAS (SINGS)
I shall be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease

ROSE listens half scared half relieved SILAS is still alive

EXT - SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY 94
SILAS strikes a match and lights his cigar
SILAS

INT - PIONEER HOUSE - DAY 95

The moment of calm ends as the remainder of PAYNE’s posse
begin to shoot again

ROSE takes a second to compose herself then empties the dead
cartridges from her gun and reloads fresh bullets
EXT - RIGHT SIDE OF THE HOUSE - DAY 96

The reason the men have stared firing again is because they
are firing at JAY who has reached the house

JAY runs past the washing line dodging the flying bullets
runs round the back of the house past dead PEYOTE JOE and
in the back door

INT - PIONEER HOUSE - DAY 97

ROSE finishes loading her gun sees a figure (JAY) run into
the room and instinctively fires hitting JAY in the heart

JAY sees that his love ROSE has just mistakenly shot him
reels back against the back wall and slumps down

ROSE does not recognise JAY the last person she would expect
to run through the door and JAY’s face white with powder
from the birch tree

ROSE has presumed he is another of PAYNE’S men

ROSE lifts herself up to look out of the window and starts
firing the pistol towards the field eyes shut knowing she
is unlikely to hit any of the shooters anyway

She fires the remaining round but keeps going and the empty
chambers click click click

Behind her on the far wall slumps JAY a bleeding hole by his
heart

Blood drips out of his mouth
JAY tries to call out to ROSE but he cannot talk

ROSE slumps back down below the window but does not turn
around

JAY looks over to her
KOTORI returns to the room

KOTORI now shirtless has brought arrows strips of cloth
paraffin

He sits next to ROSE and hands her the rifle
ROSE places her hand on his

ROSE
Until civilisation arrives

KOTORI leans in and kisses ROSE on the cheek
JAY looks gutted

There is a shelf above JAY and on that shelf a jar - large
letters - SALT

A bullet hits the jar and salt pours down right into JAY’s
wound

JAY winces in pain

KOTORI picks up his arrows and bow and walks out of the front
door

ROSE cocks the rifle looks out of the window and aims

EXT - FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY 98
KOTORI has wrapped cloth around the tips of the arrows He
dips them in paraffin and lights them aims and fires them in
the air

The flaming arrow arcs and lands in the dry wheat

The wheat quickly burns and the fire spreads rapidly

ROSE keeps aiming out the window waiting

In seconds the whole field has lit up and the remainder of
PAYNES posse have no choice but to run out

From the smoke and flames runs THE MINSTREL gun in one hand
banjo in the other

ROSE fires shooting him dead

MARIMACHO appears ROSE fires and shoots her dead

SKELLY stands up flames all around him ROSE fires shooting
him dead

INT - PIONEER HOUSE - DAY 99

ROSE turns throws the rifle down and picks up her pistol
moves up and looks out of the window sees KOTORI lying dead

ROSE
Kotori

ROSE slumps back down below the window this time facing JAY

The smoke from the burning field clears giving ROSE a clear
view of JAY

She looks directly at JAY for the first time
JAY tries to speak

JAY (WHISPER)
Rose

ROSE sees JAY

ROSE
Jay

JAY sheds a single tear

ROSE still with pistol in her hand crosses the room towards
JAY on her hands and knees

JAY smiles at ROSE and places his hand on hers

ROSE begins to softly cry

ROSE (CONT’D)
Jay

ROSE holds JAY’s hand and tries to smile through the grief

ROSE (CONTD)
Silly boy

JAY tries to talk but cannot

Light has been streaming through the front door but it turns
to shadow darkening the whole room

ROSE turns to look
PAYNE stands at the door

ROSE realises that PAYNE cannot see her gun from his line of
sight

ROSE slowly cocks the gun as PAYNE talks

PAYNE
Turn around Rose

ROSE turns the gun around and places it in JAY’s hand

PAYNE (CONT’D)
It’s over

ROSE leans in to kiss JAY on the cheek giving JAY a clear
view of PAYNE

PAYNE lifts his gun to ROSE
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Doesn’t hurt

Before PAYNE can pull the trigger JAY fires and PAYNE falls
to his knees

PAYNE falls forward onto his hands and rolls onto his back
dead

JAY shuts his eyes and lets out his last gentle breath and
dies

ROSE sobs and lowers her head

EXT - SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY 100

SILAS struggles to his feet

SILAS hobbles in through the front door and sees JAY lying

SILAS slumps down on his knees next to ROSE

They both look at JAY and not at each other

SILAS removes his hat

SILAS (CONTD)
He loved you with all his heart

ROSE
His heart was in the wrong place

SILAS
His spirit was true

JAY dead we hold him for a beat
PAYNE dead and we hold on him for a beat
