A buzzing busy theatre So busy that some PEOPLE stand in
the aisles DAVID dressed smartly walks onto a stage to
applause He goes to a reading desk carrying a book On the
spine is “The Personal History of David Copperfield”
obscured by DAVID’s hands

He’s nervous never done this before Takes a quick deep
breath for confidence Puts the book on the desk Opens it
The words on the page look fuzzy

DAVID
Whether I turn out to be the hero
of my own story

The words on the page look clearer now

DAVID (CONTD)
(more confident)
-or whether that station will be
held by anybody else

On the backcloth the outline of some buildings on the
horizon THE ROOKERY and a CHURCH

Camera attached to the clock’s pendulum as it moves back and

INT ROOKERY - FRONT ROOM - EVENING 17

To begin my life

A yelp of pain from CLARA DAVID’s mother who is bent over

DAVID (CONTD)
with the beginning of my life

BETSEY framed in the window approaching fast Not stopping
she presses her nose to it with a BUMP Everyone jumps
BETSEY with flat white nose slowly looks about Sees CLARA

BETSEY TROTWOOD
(muffled by the window)
Mrs David Copperfield I think
(glass steamed via breath)
Miss Trotwood You’ve heard of her

CLARA
Yes I’ve had that pleasure
PEGGOTTY opens the door BETSEY steps sideways from the
steamed window into the door frame

BETSEY TROTWOOD
Well now you see her

Flustered CLARA makes a meaningless half-bow half-curtsey
and sits down BETSEY enters hangs up her bonnet Lopsided
Straightens it Does it again As she speaks she shifts
various hats coats and umbrellas into a more symmetrical
position Notices name-plate by the door THE ROOKERY

BETSEY TROTWOOD (CONTD)
In the name of Heaven why Rookery

CLARA
When my husband bought the house
he liked to think there were rooks
about it

BETSEY glances about her as if the rooks might lie in wait

BETSEY TROTWOOD
And are there

CLARA
(contraction)
« « -NOOO00C0000

BETSEY TROTWOOD
(constantly moving things)
My brother all over Calls a house
a rookery and takes the rooks on
trust A better name would be
“Gullible Manor”

BETSEY sits down PEGGOTTYs had enough She steps between
BETSEY and CLARA

PEGGOTTY
(to CLARA eye-balling
BETSEY )
Will this person be stopping
Maam

CLARA
Now Peggotty

BETSEY TROTWOOD
(incredulously)
Peggotty You mean to say a human
being has gone into a church and
got herself named Peggotty

Moves a china ornament - a fisherman - a fraction of an inch
BETSEY TROTWOOD (CONTD)
Did your mother sneeze your name
when you were being christened

PEGGOTTY
It’s a normal name And do you not
think ‘Trotwood’ is a big glass
house to be chucking stones from

PEGGOTTY moves the ornament a fraction of an inch back

CLARA
(in pain)
Aaargh

PEGGOTTY hurries to CLARA BETSEY moves the fisherman again

BETSEY TROTWOOD
Aha The girl Here comes the girl

PEGGOTTY gets CLARA to her feet

CLARA
Or it could be
(mid-contraction very
low guttural)
«a bDOOOOCOOCOOOY

PEGGOTTY and BETSEY taken aback by this noise

BETSEY TROTWOOD (contd)
It’s certain to be a girl And I
beg you to call her Betsey Trotwood
Copperfield and have me as her
godmother

(gets up points at
CLARA’s bump)

There must be no mistakes in life
with this Betsey Trotwood There
must be no trifling with her
affections poor dear

CLARA yelps BETSEY takes a good look at her face moving
CLARA’s hair away from her eyes

BETSEY TROTWOOD (CONTD)
Why bless my soul you’re so young

PEGGOTTY can’t support CLARA alone

PEGGOTTY

INT ROOKERY - FOOT OF STAIRS - NIGHT 18

A beat of BETSEY’s POV ears stuffed the panic in silence as
people run up and down the stairs fetching water She
fiddles with her BROACH The clock approaching midnight HAM
has gone

DAVID
(hidden away in a corner)
-I record that I was born on a
Friday at twelve o’clock at night

PEGGOTTY runs down signalling to BETSEY BETSEY uncorks her
ears We hear mayhem shouts and a BABY The clock chiming
midnight in perfect rhythm to the BABY DAVID’s cries

BETSEY TROTWOOD
(getting up)
How is she

She starts walking towards PEGGOTTY who legs it back
upstairs as DR CHILLIP flushed comes down

DR CHILLIP
As comfortable as we can expect a
young mother to be

BETSEY TROTWOOD
No - she How is she The baby

DR CHILLIP
It’s a boy ma’am I’m happy to
congratulate-

BETSEY TROTWOOD
(walking towards CHILLIP)
Why congratulate Is the boy the
first of twins with his sister
being born as we speak

DR CHILLIP
Er

DR CHILLIP shakes his head BETSEY grabs her bonnet and looks
like she may hit DR CHILLIP hard with it Thinks better of it
off PEGGOTTY’s look exits still with one long piece of
cotton dangling from her ear PEGGOTTY reappears and almost
in one move rearranges the coats etc as they were

Sounds of the BABY DAVID gurgling Screen fills with light
Gradually indistinct shapes appear Over these we can on
occasion vaguely see DAVID and BABY DAVID’s hands and the
edge of a crib

Suddenly CLARA’s face comes in close blowing a raspberry
PEGGOTTY
Look at you Baby Davy Face like a

peach I’m very fond of peaches

She playfully leans in as if to eat him We briefly see
DAVID

DAVID
I remember Peggotty’s rough
fingers like a pocket nutmeg-
grater
CU of PEGGOTTY’s huge coarse fingers

tall hens

A strange hedge FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAVID fighting it with an
oversized toy sword

INTEXT ROOKERY - LANDINGCHURCHYARD - DAY 22

DAVID inside at the window From his POV we see the church
and distant gravestones Trees seem to bend over it like
giants As he speaks FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAVID joins him

DAVID (0S)

another in the wind like giants
whispering secrets

PEGGOTTY
What a remarkable vegetable

FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAVID
(laughing)

world of gammon and spinnage it is

Stood by the window DAVID looks to CLARA who sits now with
YOUNG DAVID and PEGGOTTY

YOUNG DAVID
(to CLARA)
A world of gammon and spinnage

CLARA writes it down YOUNG DAVID copies her

INT ROOKERY - PANTRY - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 24

The figure of MURDSTONE approaches PEGGOTTY picks up a
basket of washing

PEGGOTTY
The gentleman is here ma’am with
the black hair and particular
manner who walked home with you
from church last Sunday

MURDSTONE comes through the doorway a big towering figure
carrying a RIDING CROP CLARA immediately delighted

MURDSTONE
(re a plant by the door
pulling a bit off)
Now is this your famous geranium
(spotting DAVID)
Ah and you must be the man of the
house

YOUNG DAVID
I am a boy sir

YOUNG DAVID holds on to CLARA with his right hand

MURDSTONE
Dear boy Come Shake hands

MURDSTONE has thick black hair in his ears His hand with
signet ring looms huge YOUNG DAVID goes to shake it but
with his left hand

MURDSTONE (CONTD)
(loud mocking)
That’s the wrong hand boy

YOUNG DAVID sticks with his left hand Extends it even
further

MURDSTONE (CONTD)
(drops his hand with a
look to CLARA)
Maybe your way will catch on
Youre a brave fellow

YOUNG DAVID stares at MURDSTONE’s hand CLARA gives PEGGOTTY
a conspiratorial nod PEGGOTTY understands She still holds

the washing basket Putting it down we now see it’s a CRAN

full of HERRING She takes YOUNG DAVID’s hand

PEGGOTTY

YOUNG DAVID

(wriggling never still)

If the world is really as round as

In an armchair in the corner knitting sits MRS GUMMIDGE

MRS GUMMIDGE

(to PEGGOTTY re MRS G)

PEGGOTTY
(quietly)
That’s Mrs Gummidge Her husband
was drownded too

PEGGOTTY hands MRS GUMMIDGE fish and potatoes

YOUNG DAVID and EMILY leave the boathouse together

Later EMILY skimming stones across the water’s surface
expertly YOUNG DAVID impressed excited nervous

YOUNG DAVID
I like the seaside very much

EMILY
The sea is cruel and brutish I’ve
seen it tear a boat as big as our
house all to pieces

She skims a stone YOUNG DAVID more awkward carries on

YOUNG DAVID
I hope it wasn’t the boat that your
father was drownded in

EMILY
‘Drowned’ Uncle says ‘drownded’
and he’s wrong It’s a silly
Yarmouth way of speaking The word
is drowned

YOUNG DAVID
(gabbling now)
I never saw my father He’s
normal dead My mother and I and
Peggotty are by ourselves But in
the happiest state imaginable

Tries to skim a stone He’s rubbish ends up accidentally
flinging it behind him instead of out to sea

He attempts to skim again Terrible - it hits the shingle

Seems a fair life to work on a
boat or in the harbour

EMILY
Your hands get red raw and you
can’t ever - ever - escape the
smell

YOUNG DAVID
(distracted by the boats)
Your hands have nice skin

Then suddenly

EMILY
Look Look at this Davy

EMILY is already climbing up a mast near to the top If she
falls she’ll be crushed between boats

discovers the hole the bones were
dug from is full of gold watches
and money

YOUNG DAVID

CU on smiling YOUNG DAVID smiling PEGGOTTY smiling DANIEL
PEGGOTTY smiling EMILY smiling HAM Then MRS GUMMIDGE

MRS GUMMIDGE
Let me die as a favour to myself

Suddenly A SHADOW looming and then RUMBLING from the roof
of the boathouse It begins to shake Looking up we see the
wood splintering the boathouse beginning to tear and split
Everyone watches debris falling on them DAYLIGHT shines
through the hole

Close on YOUNG DAVID The roof now seems to be made partly of
paper Some MASSIVE FINGERS come in through the hole The
characters now appear to be frozen in happy party-mode as
life-sized drawings but in their clothes Some bits of paper
fall around them

The boathouse is made entirely of paper The full HAND (with
SIGNET RING) of MURDSTONE coming through the roof The life-
size paper people now appear to have been drawn by a child

MURDSTONE (0S)
Hello what have you got there

From YOUNG DAVID’s POV MURDSTONE reaches down and picks up
the drawing YOUNG DAVID on the floor with his toys and
books has been drawing boathouses On other pieces of paper
he’s written words and phrases he heard in Yarmouth

MURDSTONE
A house made from a boat Draw a
boat or draw a house none of this
nonsense

CLARA behind MURDSTONE weaker sheepish

PEGGOTTY
(to CLARA)
Mrs Copperfield - is it all Is

Youve got a Pa David A new one

Astonished and upset YOUNG DAVID glances round for him

YOUNG DAVID
A new Pa

MURDSTONE
Your mother and I are now married

PEGGOTTY
I meant to tell you sooner Davy

YOUNG DAVID glances out the window to the churchyard - his
expression changes as a moment later the CHURCH and his
FATHER’S GRAVESTONE are next to the window as if looking in

PEGGOTTY goes towards YOUNG DAVID MURDSTONE blocks

MURDSTONE
(sotto to PEGGOTTY)
You addressed my wife by a surname
that is not hers She is now Mrs
Murdstone Will you remember that

PEGGOTTY gives a curtsey of loathing as we hear the front
door and they head downstairs MISS JANE MURDSTONE
Murdstone’s sister has arrived PEGGOTTY helps a COACHMAN
with the luggage black boxes with the initials JM on the
lids in brass nails JANE pays out of a hard steel purse that
clicks loudly

MURDSTONE (CONTD)

PEGGOTTY hushes YOUNG DAVID before he speaks out

MISS MURDSTONE
A fair choice I regret I missed
the wedding and the chance to meet
you at the peak of your beauty

CLARA curtseys waits for MURDSTONE to introduce Davy who
watches her from the foot of the stairs He does not CLARA
pushes DAVID forward

MISS MURDSTONE (CONTD)

PEGGOTTY

CLARA gets them from her purse Gives them to MISS MURDSTONE
who moves off PEGGOTTY aghast follows CLARA embraces
YOUNG DAVID

CLARA

YOUNG DAVID
Why are you whispering and saying

She puts her hand in his and leads him into the parlour
their hands behind YOUNG DAVID’s back so as not to be seen

37 INT ROOKERY - PARLOUR - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 37

up her bag drops the keys on the floor

MISS MURDSTONE
It’s clear my status in this house

MURDSTONE
Jane Murdstone be silent

YOUNG DAVID picks the keys up MURDSTONE snatches them off
him without even looking down Gives them to JANE She puts
the keys away and her bag down

INT ROOKERY - FOOT OF STAIRS PANTRY - DAY 38

A rainy morning YOUNG DAVID and PEGGOTTY watch MISS
MURDSTONE through the open door Dressed in a black velvet
gown she’s still opening and slamming cupboards

PEGGOTTY
She looks like she’s made of wax

YOUNG DAVID
Or Dutch cheese

Muffled laughter from them

PEGGOTTY
Is she searching for somewhere
secret to sleep so she can jump
out and terrify us

YOUNG DAVID
I reckon she doesnt sleep She
just hangs Like a bat

He impersonates Miss Murdstone as a bat ‘wings folded
teeth biting lower lip PEGGOTTY stifles a laugh

YOUNG DAVID (CONTD)

“I presume it is named”

on the page some on the floor YOUNG DAVID can’t speak
Looks at MURDSTONE who has a stray letter on his face

83 INTEXT BETSEY TROTWOOD’S HOUSE - PARLOUR - DAY (CONTINUOTBS)

BETSEY leads DAVID in through the French doors The house is
bright fresh

BETSEY TROTWOOD
Stand there yes

DAVID
(staggering)
I’m sorry Everything is
circular I’m going to drop

BETSEY TROTWOOD
He’s about to collapse Janet Mind
the settee it’s Viennese No -
there there go there

JANET throws a rug on the sofa where DAVID looks like he’11l
fall but now unconscious he falls into a very smart
armchair to BETSEY’s distress

HARD CUT TO

DAVID briefly fainted From DAVID’S POV BETSEY now has some
bottles and pours the contents into DAVID’s mouth

DAVID
What are you doing

BETSEY TROTWOOD
Medicine Reviving you

DAVID
This is salad dressing

BETSEY TROTWOOD
Ah I thought it was Armagnac No
spectacles on

DAVID
Do you have a lettuce somewhere
doused in medicine

MR DICK shouts from the stairs

MR DICK (0S)
Head entirely removed We’re sure

He appears at the door

BETSEY TROTWOOD
(signalling - ‘Not now’)
Let’s leave Charles’s head to one

side for now

MR DICK
Pick it up later Understood
(to DAVID smiling)
How do you do

BETSEY and MR DICK begin talking over DAVID’s head

BETSEY TROTWOOD
(signals for MR DICK to
look at her)
Now Mr Dick don’t be a fool
because nobody can be more
discerning than you when you
choose

MR DICK is immediately serious and solemn

BETSEY TROTWOOD (CONTD)
(a lacy shawl round DAVID)
You have heard me mention my
brother David Copperfield

BETSEY takes DICK aside JANET back in now She picks up a
plate of cakes

MR DICK
(doesn’t remember at all)
Yes just now Oh you mean you
mentioned it before this moment Of
course you did I remember it well
I’m hungry

DAVID
(focusing on cakes)
Cakes Those are cakes

JANET beside DAVID with the plate at his head height Grabs
a cake and gives it to MR DICK DAVID looks on eagerly

BETSEY TROTWOOD
Well this is his son who’s run
away What shall we do with him

DAVID looks hungrily at the plate of cakes Almost takes one

DAVID
One thing you could do is

MR DICK
If I were you - I should wash him

BETSEY TROTWOOD
(relieved to have an
answer)
Janet Heat the bath
(she’s right behind her)
Oh you’re there

DAVID about to take a cake as JANET moves off She leaves the
cakes on a small table

DAVID
The thing is I haven’t eaten
since

BETSEY TROTWOOD
(to DAVID)
Mr Dick cracks it every time
(glancing out the window
hands DICK the salad
dressing)
More donkeys Good Lord there must
be fifty Janet

DICK takes a seat inspecting the salad dressing as BETSEY
runs out with JANET through a side door Through the French
doors we see played out in silence BETSEY arrive with a
broom and swing it at the riders DAVID and DICK each eating
a big slice of cake watch A TALL TEENAGE BOY leads a
donkey

DAVID
Is my aunt really going to

MR DICK
Visit violence upon the boy Yes

BETSEY
(faint through the
window)
I’ve warned you Don’t say you
weren’t warned

From their POV we see BETSEY grab the TALL TEENAGE BOY with
one hand and slam his head against a signpost which reads
“NO DONKEYS” He runs off she turns strolls back towards
the house MR DICK laughs

MR DICK
Remarkable woman Very kind

He turns to DAVID but he’s now sound asleep on the sofa

CUT TO

INT BETSEY TROTWOOD’S HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY 84

Morning DAVID dressing in Mr Dick’s clothes in front of a
long mirror Tentatively he acts out some characters

DAVID
(as MR DICK)
“Head taken off We’re sure”
(as BETSEY)
“Donkeys I’ve got a fork”
(as Tungey)
“Donkeysgot a fork ”

Delighted he gets confident The mirror seems to contain the
actual character not DAVID The face of MICAWBER appears

DAVIDMICAWBER
You’re stealing an honest man’s
chicken

His sole possession - the St Paul’s box - sits on the window
ledge

INT BETSEY TROTWOOD’S HOUSE - LANDING - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 85

Through a doorway MR DICK - dressed almost identically - is
writing with a long pen his head almost laid upon the paper

DAVID
Good morning Mr Dick
MR DICK
Ah young man Can you form a

queue
David unsure of how to do this on his own

MR DICK (CONTD)
The capital letter Q I’m trying
different forms

INT BETSEY TROTWOOD’S HOUSE - MR DICK’S ROOM - DAY 86
(CONTINUOUS )

A cluttered room Piles of paper pens inkpots pen-knives
paperweights The bed at a mad angle A small model of the
room made from scavenged items or straw and string Donkeys
made of straw One side (with the models) is quite neat the
other a chaos of papers A big kite prominent in the corner
MR DICK writes trying different formations of a capital ‘Q’

MR DICK
I like this a cigar in an ashtray

DAVID
Or a kite with a string

MR DICK
(distracted)
“The executioner’s blade is cold
and sharp”

DAVID
I’m sorry

MR DICK
(normal points at kite)
Your aunt me that kite to get me
out the house while she drinks
coffee and is quiet

DAVID
Are you writing stories Mr Dick
About King Charles the First

MR DICK
(alarmed amazed)
Why What makes you say that

DAVID
(gesturing to papers)
There seems to be the occasional
reference to him on

We see MR DICK’s papers are full of drawings of Charles his
signature CHARLES R chopped heads complicated doodles
There are piles of these scraps of paper looming over MR
DICK close to falling over

MR DICK

(reassured)
Oh yes King Charles He does creep
in You see I’m trying to draft a
petition calling for improved
housing conditions for the
labouring poor I work hard at it
but the thoughts in King Charles’
head keep intruding

DAVID
I understand
(a beat)
Sorry no I don’t King Charles’s
head

MR DICK nods Points to his own nodding head

MR DICK
I believe owing to a disagreement
they cut off Charles’s head

DAVID
In 1649 That’s well documented

MR DICK

Well for some reason I don’t fully
understand they removed all the
troubling thoughts from his head
and put them instead into mine

(becoming more agitated)
Look at this

(shows DAVID)
-I write them down It’s most
disruptive

(to himself)
“IT mount the scaffold wearing two
shirts so shivers aren’t mistaken
for fear”

MR DICK looks away upset then into the mirror Seems to
correct himself DAVID sees on a table a vase of flowers
with the heads cut off and arranged around the bottom

MR DICK (CONTD)
I know it must all sound peculiar
DAVID
By no means Something similar
happens to me

MR DICK
(excited suspicious)
Really Who do you get Not
Charles

DAVID
No no But I find when I’ve been
in the company of some person of
strong character their voice
becomes lodged in my head I
often wonder whether I’m

DAVID (CONTD) MR DICK

Different in some way Out of your mind

DAVID jumps up runs out the room A beat then he’s back
with his St Paul’s box Opens it Full of scraps of paper

DAVID (CONTD)
I too write down the thoughts I
have and the things I observe

MR DICK reads some of DAVID’s writing

MR DICK
“Miss Murdstone’s sleepless eyes
like two red suns” Very good “The
bottles are propelled by iron
pistons that nod up and down like
melancholy mad elephants”

DAVID
What d’you think

MR DICK

Oh just right And excellent
calligraphy Your ‘L’ here looks
like the handle of a butter-churn
and the ‘K’ like a folding chair

The dinner gong is banged downstairs

JANET (0S)
Breakfast Breakfast

MR DICK
Thatll be breakfast
(he starts to turn away
from DAVID troubled)
“At my final breakfast I hear the
mob gather to witness my death”

DAVID
(excited)
We’ll banish that mob Mr Dick

87 INT BETSEY TROTWOOD’S HOUSE - PARLOUR - DAY 87

BETSEY at breakfast eating boiled eggs Severing the top of
one DAVID runs down

DAVID
Aunt - Mr Dick Is he at all

BETSEY TROTWOOD
Did he mention Charles the First

DAVID
A little Actually quite a lot

BETSEY TROTWOOD
That’s his allegorical way of
expressing it He connects his
illness with great disturbance and
agitation But his mind is sharp as
a surgeon’s lancet make no
mistake

DAVID has a sudden thought

DAVID
I think I may be able to help him

BETSEY TROTWOOD
Then go back up Trotwood Janet
can soft-boil an egg in a flash

DAVID goes to exit comes back

DAVID

BETSEY TROTWOOD

call you Trotwood If I’m to
financially support my nephew I
want to like his name

DAVID comes back in MR DICK is writing like a demon piling
up scraps of paper He’s upset and agitated

DAVID
(excited)
Mr Dick The troubling thoughts
from King Charles’s head - they
weigh you down

MR DICK
(looking at the pile)
(to himself)
“As I die I go from a corruptible
to an incorruptible crown”
(holds up his pen)
I throw them in there-
(nods to overflowing
wastepaper basket)
But they pile up and oppress me

DAVID
(trying to copy Betsey’s
gesture to snap Mr Dick
out of it)
But we can release them Mr Dick
We can cast them to the wind

in the air with it

MR DICK
The sky is absorbing the troubling
words And

DAVID
The higher the words go

MR DICK
The more clear my mind becomes Oh
the clarity

MR DICK changes seem to become less tense less twitchy
warmer more naturally conversational

MR DICK (CONTD)
It’s like I’m reading for the bar
again just before it all and I
shared a staircase with Tommy
Traddles who had a comic head of
hair and was such a terrific fellow
- “un camarade tres formidable” as
the French say There’s a thing -
Id completely forgotten I can
speak French This is a remarkable
day

DAVID
It’s a delight to see you so
liberated

MR DICK
What will you do

DAVID
About what

MR DICK
Your thoughts What will you do
with them

DAVID
Oh I like my thoughts

MR DICK
But the voices They are real

DAVID
Yes It’s as if my head were a room
with many visitors They come and
go likea breath

MR DICK
We’re going to be the best of
friends
(looking up the kite is
falling)

Oh dear Oh dear
(to himself reverting to
old Mr Dick)
“IT can hear them build the scaffold
and hone the axe’s blade”

DAVID
Let’s run faster to keep it in the
air Look it’s rising

They run faster

MR DICK
Up it goes again Three hundred
hurrahs plus half a dozen imperial
woo-hoos My mind is clear

being led over the green by a BOY

DAVID (0S)
Donkeys

DAVID comes out clanging the pan with the ladle A wild
gesture to scare them off Slightly undignified

DAVID (CONTD)
Shoo I’11 tan your hide and put
you in a stew I’m a huge maniac

He clangs not noticing a white-haired man and his daughter
MR WICKFIELD and AGNES have appeared

DAVID pauses clanging turns sees them is deeply
embarrassed Drops the ladle A beat

DAVID (CONTD)
We suffer from a plague of donkeys
You may think I am exaggerating
which perhaps I am

AGNES smiles

WICKFIELD
Very ferocious shoo-ing You must
be Trotwood I’m Wickfield I act
for your aunt in matters of
finance My daughter Agnes

DAVID goes for a handshake with WICKFIELD but turns it into
a bow to AGNES quite low

AGNES
A bow I am so rarely bowed to

DAVID
I hope I’ve started a new fashion
Unless you deem it inappropriate

AGNES
Not at all Trotwood I shall demand
it at our every meeting from now
on as if I am an Empress Or mad

BETSEY comes out

BETSEY TROTWOOD
Ah Mr Wickfield Please come
in

WICKFIELD
That was quite the journey Is it
too early for sherry

A little early

WICKFIELD
Port then It’s seven in the
evening in Singapore I imagine

But scarcely dawn in
Newfoundland

rushes past WICKFIELD picks up a bottle of sherry and hands
it to JANET without WICKFIELD seeing JANET subtly sticks it
in a drinks cabinet on wheels shaped like an antique globe
Closes it WICKFIELD stands restless

BETSEY TROTWOOD
(sitting down)
Mr Wickfield owns the freehold of a
very good educational establishment
in Canterbury

She nods to JANET to start wheeling the Globe off

WICKFIELD
It’s snapping at the heels of the
better known establishments

DAVID
I have a thirst for education that
sadly has never been quenched

AGNES
Really You give the impression of
having a very well watered
intellect

There’s a CLINK from the Globe AGNES subtly gestures to
JANET to stop

WICKFIELD
All this talk of thirst is making
me thirsty

The clinking attracts WICKFIELD’s attention BETSEY stands
up to block him

BETSEY TROTWOOD
How is business Mr Wickfield

WICKFIELD skirts around her JANET is forced to move aside

WICKFIELD
(too quick)
All is well
(a beat of reflection)
There are of course challenges -
reduced tariffs the retreat from
mercantilism
(MORE)

WICKFIELD (CONTD)
(he’s by the globe now)
Here and in Europe the Americas
(pokes the globe hoping
to open it)
Africa I could go on

‘All is well’ would have sufficed

MR DICK appears at the door

Good afternoon I’m Mr Dick I am
very partial to gingerbread

AGNES
As am I Mr Dick I adore the fiery
taste Delighted to meet you

MR DICK

“Delighted”

He doesn’t notice

AGNES

MR DICK
It remains- does it not - attached

on the floor cutting up bits of manuscript handing them to
MR DICK DICK pasting by dipping paper into a SAUCER full of
glue and turning to slap it onto the kite Occasionally
pausing to write down a thought

DAVID
He believes that when Charles the
First was executed the King’s
troubles flew from his head to nest
in Mr Dick’s own

AGNES
Is that why you fly them on your
kite Mr Dick to rid yourself of

them

MR DICK
Precisely

AGNES
Well it is the obvious course of
action

MR DICK
Trotwood suggested it He is a
marvel

Watches MR DICK swivel from notes to kite
AGNES
Mr Dick you look like youre
playing the kettle-drums

DAVID laughs

DAVID
He does of course
(to AGNES )

You should write that down

AGNES
Yes ready for the next time I see
someone pasting things at speed to

Oh - I like you

AGNES
What a happy coincidence because I
like you too

full of waistcoats and shirts the clock face removed stood

was a shaving kit A smart jacket hangs on a tailor’s dummy

This book’s quite long Why don’t I
tell you a story of mine Perhaps
one about a kindly nurse and her
charge

PEGGOTTY and YOUNG DAVID appear

DAVID (CONTD)
-who slept in an upturned boat

STEERFORTH
No I don’t care for whimsy Sorry

PEGGOTTY and YOUNG DAVID slope off

STEERFORTH (CONTD)
Do you have a scary story

DAVID
I have one aboutan evil
schoolmaster

STEERFORTH
Yes What does he look like

A hideous one-eyed version of MURDSTONE emerges from
STEERFORTH’s tailor’s dummy wearing a similar jacket

DAVID
He has but one eye when the popular
prejudice runs in favour of two

MURDSTONE has an eye patch STEERFORTH laughs

DAVID (CONTD)
His hair
(he thinks)
e-he has none at all

MURDSTONE now completely bald This is DAVID controlling him

STEERFORTH
What’s the man’s name

DAVID
It’s Murd-i-stone Oh he is cruel
He viciously beats any boy who
doesn’t know his lesson

STEERFORTH
The monster Is there vengeance Is
he himself thrashed and battered

DAVID
He has an equally cruel sister

STEERFORTH
Ah you see he’s got a sister

DAVID
She hangs a hard steel bag on her
arm by a heavy chain and is a cold
and metallic lady

A metal pillar or a water pipe with valve becomes JANE
MURDSTONE holding her metallic bag She looks a complete
mess

DAVID (CONTD)
She takes no care of her appearance
or hygiene and she punches her
brother to goad him on to further
savagery

JANE MURDSTONE punches the bald MURDSTONE in the side of his
head He whimpers

MISS MURDSTONE
Be a man

MURDISTONE
Jane

STEERFORTH hears something outside

STEERFORTH
Heep’s up Into bed

DAVID jumps back into bed just before URIAH HEEP silently
opens the door and looks in The MURDSTONES have gone URIAH
creeps around counts the boys and then begins opening the
odd drawer and trunk peering in

URIAH
Good Fine All fine

Then he exits A beat MR MICAWBER appears in the shadows

DAVID
Shall I tell you the tale of the
insolvent but ever-hopeful

STEERFORTH
No No more stories Daisy Sorry
but I need to sleep

STEERFORTH turns over in bed as MICAWBER scratches his head
and wanders off

INT BOTTLING WAREHOUSE - DAY 104

DAVID and STEERFORTH stand in the factory watching the
earlier scene of bottle-smashing but fictionalised and more
stylized now by DAVID Thick shards of light break across the
room MURDSTONE JANE MURDSTONE CREAKLE and TUNGAY are all
present but it’s YOUNG DAVID who holds a bottle

YOUNG DAVID
I shall smash it

MISS MURDSTONE
Then I shall smash you

MURDSTONE
Jane

TUNGAY

CREAKLE
(quietly)
Be quiet

TUNGAY
QUIET

MURDSTONE

TUNGAY
Tungay Me
CREAKLE

Be quiet

TUNGAY
QUIET

YOUNG DAVID smashes the bottle

MISS MURDSTONE

Right

MURDSTONE
Enough

TUNGAY
ENOUGH

MURDSTONE approaches YOUNG DAVID YOUNG DAVID punches
MURDSTONE in the jaw and he falls into a cart full of
bottles taking JANE with him They both scream The cart
starts to move towards the huge rickety-looking structure of
bottles Instead of crashing into the structure the cart
curves away tips over and bottles fall in two directions
One bottle hits a strut which props up the huge structure
The strut falls and the huge structure collapses
immediately A terrible hilarious CRASH

STEERFORTH
And you make these tales of the
factory boy up out of thin air

DAVID
Invented yes

The MURDSTONES and a horrified TUNGAY and CREAKLE watch as
YOUNG DAVID escapes

SEAMLESS
TRANSITION TO

EXT CANTERBURY STREETS - DAY 105

DAVID and STEERFORTH walk through shelves of bottles and step
out into the middle of the street Rows of bottles can be
seen in the foreground on a MARKET STALL

STEERFORTH
I could see the boy like he was
actually there Daisy You truly
are the Eighth Wonder
DAVID
Thank you

STEERFORTH
You seem to know all the details
about the factory - was your father
in manufacturing

DAVID
My stepfather

STEERFORTH
(suspects something)
You have a stepfather but were
brought up by an aunt

DAVID
(changes subject
pointing)
Who is that Steerforth

A young lady MISS LARKINS is climbing into a carriage

STEERFORTH
Ah - that’s the eldest Miss
Larkins Pretty isn’t she

DAVID
She is a blaze of beauty

STEERFORTH
She’s engaged to an army captain

DAVID
Only because she has yet to meet
me

They laugh then

BUTCHERS BOY (0S)
Look out Couple of Mrs Strongs
prize poodles have got loose

Across the road behind a MEAT STALL is a BUTCHERS BOY
DAVID’s age hair greased flat Looks like a boxer

BUTCHERS BOY (CONTD)
Oi Ladies Come here I’11l beat
you with one hand tied behind me

DAVID is aware that MISS LARKINS is clocking this

DAVID
(shouts to BUTCHERS BOY)
You want to fight do you Then sir -
name your time

STEERFORTH
Don’t fight him Promise me you
won’t fight him

106 EXT BUTCHER’S SHOP YARD - DAY 106

DAVID ready to fight Surrounded by meat detritus off-cuts
bits of hooves blood in metal buckets and PEOPLE

STEERFORTH
You can box I take it Daisy

DAVID
After a fashion certainly

REFEREE BOY
Gentlemen No eyeball-gouging
noactually everything else is
allowed Get setfight

The crowd roars DAVID starts dancing around loosening up
raises his fists toBANG BUTCHERS BOY has run and
smashed a fist into his face DAVID flailing

STEERFORTH
Hook feint uppercut

DAVID turns hazy and staggering towards STEERFORTH

DAVID
What

Wallop The BUTCHERS BOY slams in for a sudden crunching
punch that knocks DAVID out Brief blackness DAVID comes to
He’s fallen into a pile of straw and meat off-cuts He’s just
missed a SHEEP’S HEAD STEERFORTH anxious to avoid the
filth helps him up by offering him his cane Pulling himself
up DAVID nearly knocks over a sloshing bucket of blood

STEERFORTH
You did in some ways very well
Daisy But a gentleman shouldn’t be
beaten by a Butcher’s Boy
Presumably we must buy steak for
your eye from the self-same fellow

DAVID covered in mud and some animal blood looks through
the arch into the street MISS LARKINS is walking by with a
FRIEND She pauses looks at him horrified

STEERFORTH (CONTD)
Let’s get you to Wickfield’s house

EXT WICKFIELD’S HOUSE - DAY 107

Establisher of Mr Wickfield’s townhouse STEERFORTH brings
DAVID inside

STEERFORTH
Come on I’m afraid you’ve been
butchered dear Daisy

INT WICKFIELD’S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - DAY 108

A SMALL BOY with a bandaged head walks past STEERFORTH DAVID
on a sofa URIAH perched on the arm tends to DAVID’s black
eye with a piece of steak his cut lip with hot water and
iodine

URIAH
There’s a degree of animal blood
from the meat-
(to STEERFORTH)
-as well as Master Copperfield’s
own essence

STEERFORTH
Try not to die or anything boring
like that Daisy

DAVID
Ill try my be-

URIAH places a big piece of cotton on DAVID’s lip STEERFORTH
exits

URIAH
What a confident gentleman he is
(dabbing the cut lip)
Mother has taught me the medical
rudiments She’s the laundress
here Washes your bedsheets

DAVID
Always very clean Relatively

URIAH
Oh She will burst with gratitude
that you’ve acknowledged her
spontaneously Master Copperfield
(getting closer to DAVID)
Miss Wickfield she’s - she’s
verydo you not think

DAVID
(taking the meat off)
Very What Tall Pleasant Good
at backgammon

URIAH gives DAVID a look Then AGNES enters URIAH exits

AGNES
My dear Trotwood they told me you
were here Oh dear look at you
(then)
But I imagine the other fellow must
be dreadfully injured

DAVID
Oh yes - close to death Measured
for his coffin

She sits beside DAVID on the sofa and begins tending to his
injuries

AGNES
How were Uriah’s ministrations

DAVID
Hes like a human cold in the head
He gets so close

AGNES
Yes It’s as if he lives up your
nose and is keen to get home

They laugh

AGNES (CONTD)
Did he mention his mother

DAVID
His mother Oh Agnes I burst
with gratitude that you should ask
me such a question spontaneously

They laugh harder

AGNES
So is this Steerforth’s doing
getting you into fights

DAVID
No He tried to stop me Doesn’t
think a gentleman should be seen
fighting a butcher’s boy

AGNES
A gentleman

DAVID
Yes Steerforth thinks of me as a
gentleman

AGNES
You are
(pause)
So I’m assuming you haven’t told
him
Special

DAVID
No I fear he mightThis is the
first time someone like that has
regarded me as an equal Except
you Agnes And I think of you
as

AGNES DAVID (CONTD)
A sister

DAVID (CONTD)
A special sister

Micro reaction from AGNES Suddenly URIAH has appeared
between them behind the sofa AGNES gets up putting space
between herself and URIAH

URIAH
Might I be bold enough to ask you
to come to tea With me and mother

DAVID
What a shame I fear I have a prior
engagement on that date

URIAH
On which date I don’t believe I
mentioned a date

AGNES
(holding in laughter)
I don’t believe you did

URIAH
I understand It’s not my place to
invite the likes of you to tea

DAVID stands

DAVID
No no I wouldI would be glad
to come Mr Heep

URIAH

Uriah please Oh Mother will go
off like a rocket Like a rocket
On the 14th perhaps at four

(laying a hand on AGNES’

shoulder)

And if Miss Wickfield would
care

AGNES
Sadly
(teasing DAVID)
On the 14th at fourI have a
prior engagement

DAVID
Of course I am meant to join you
in that engagement am I not Agnes

AGNES
I don’t believe so no

DAVID
Good then I can definitely come to
teaUriah

URIAH
Oh I am so proud to be noticed by
you I’m in ecstasy

URIAH does another very low bow

URIAH (CONTD)
I will arrange things with mother

AGNES visibly relaxes as URIAH heads for the door She begins
to move back towards the sofa

URIAH (CONTD)
(re steak)
Are you done with that Its a
tolerably nice bit of rump
(to AGNES)
No offence meant Im sure

DAVID nods URIAH takes the steak bows low exits

109 INT MRS STRONG’S SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY 109

DAVID now much more confident Lounging around with
STEERFORTH on a bench All the BOYS chatting relaxed

STEERFORTH
Tell me more about the impecunious
debtor hiding behind carcasses
(impression of DAVID)
Theres something on the way

DAVID
(as MICAWBER)
“Something will turn up”

STEERFORTH
Thats it

As if by magic MICAWBERs voice is heard

MICAWBER (0S)
An excellent precept young man

A beaming MICAWBER comes through the door He’s wearing a

second-hand suit too big for him a waistcoat made of the

distinctive curtains and a pair of pince-nez YOUNG DAVID
walks to his side smiling A story is coming alive again
Then MRS STRONG and URIAH HEEP come in behind him

MRS STRONG
We have a new master joining us
Professor Micawber MA Cantab

YOUNG DAVID disappears Nod from MICAWBER to an amazed DAVID
who has his head down avoiding eye contact

MR MICAWBER
(fiddles with glasses)
Good morning boys Be seated

STEERFORTH
(whispering to David)
Oh dear Lord this place really
must be short of money

MRS STRONG
You lived with the Professor when
you were in London I believe Mr
Copperfield

DAVID
The Professor yes Briefly and at
the same time lengthily

URIAH
Very nice Very genteel

URIAH exits Followed by MRS STRONG

MR MICAWBER
Now Which particular dish from the
great feast of knowledge will it be
our mutual privilege to partake in
at this current juncture

The boys look at him blankly

MR MICAWBER (contd) (CONTD)
In short what lesson is it now

The BLACKBOARD behind him contains mathematical sums and
equations (but there’s enough room for MICAWBER to write)

STEERFORTH
(enjoying this)
It’s Latin grammar now sir

A look from DAVID no it isn’t

MR MICAWBER
(oh dear)
Ah Latin Good Conjugations
Active indicatives Amo amas
amat Aquarium aquarius gymnasium
and omnibus Etcetera

STEERFORTH
And how does that ode continue

MR MICAWBER

In much the same vein before
reaching its apposite end Or
Terminus To use the Latin word

(hastily)
But we linger too long in the
ancient world Let us diversify
Mathematics

MICAWBER turns to the blackboard finds a space on which to
write picks up some chalk

MR MICAWBER (CONTD)
Behold the most important
numerical lesson a man can learn
Annual income twenty pounds

He chalks ‘£20’ on the board

MR MICAWBER (CONTD)
--annual expenditure nineteen
nineteen and six

He chalks ‘£1919s6d ’

MR MICAWBER (CONTD)
--result

MARKHAM
Sixpence

MR MICAWBER
No smarty-pantaloons Result
happiness

STEERFORTH begins grinning widely The others follow suit
DAVID torn between his two friends

MR MICAWBER (CONTD)
But conversely annual income
twenty pounds

(chalks ‘£20)
--annual expenditure twenty pounds
nought and six

(chalks ‘200s6d ’)
»result - misery Or at least
until something turns up

STEERFORTH turns wide-eyed and smiling to DAVID

STEERFORTH
(mouths points)
It’s him

DAVID
(mouths )
Don’t say anything

MR MICAWBER
Please copy that in your best hand

The boys get to work Silence Close on DAVID We hear the
wheeze of a concertina being taken out of a bag DAVID’s eyes
widen with horror Then terrible music Everyone looks up
MICAWBER is playing Nods to DAVID - “Great isn’t it”

MR MICAWBER (CONTD)
(over the music)
There is a belief among a good many
medical men that music may help in
the absorption of knowledge

MICAWBER plays on Sniggers begin then laughing

STEERFORTH
Enough I’m tempted to burst my ear
drums with a pair of pencils

MR MICAWBER
I beg your pardon sir

DAVID
Steerforth meant that possibly the
instrument might have developed a
leak or

STEERFORTH
Not at all I meant he is a dismal
musician

MR MICAWBER
Be quiet please Mr Steelforge Who
are you to insult a gentleman

STEERFORTH
(heads to MICAWBER looks
around the room)
Where is he this gentleman I see
only an impudent beggar Put that
damned contraption down

He tries to grab the concertina MICAWBER holds on to it
Tiny squeaks as each refuses to let go DAVID gets up -
unsure of whom to help Funny but then STEERFORTH grabs the
concertina and throws it violently across the room MRS
STRONG enters with URIAH

MRS STRONG
I heard some manner of mad wheezing
Professor Is there a squirrel
trapped in the pipes again

STEERFORTH
He’s no professor Ask him about
debtors’ prison Ask him about the
scores of I0Us in Copperfield’s
trunk

STEERFORTH looks to URIAH The smallest of nods from URIAH

DAVID
‘Scores’ is an exaggeration A few
Five or sixten at most

STEERFORTH
He’s extorted money for years and
has followed Daisy here to continue
his efforts

MICAWBER
Mr Steepgorge is correct in that I
did to my shame reside within
prison walls after pecuniary

MRS STRONG

Even we draw the line at employing
former convicts

(realises)
and indeed much higher than
that is where we actually draw the
line We’ll part if you please Mr
Heep show him out

URIAH leads out MICAWBER DAVID goes to object but MICAWBER
places a hand on his shoulder

MICAWBER
It’s no matter my friend

MICAWBER picks his concertina up stuffs it unlocked in his
bag so it emits a small muffled tuneless sigh as he walks

EXT CANTERBURY STREET - NEXT MORNING 110

DAVID runs through the streets People boarding the coach
luggage stowed DAVID sees the MICAWBERS A pregnant MRS
MICAWBER - wearing a cape made from a curtain the curtain
tie with tassels around her neck - sees him gives him a hug

MRS MICAWBER
No sooner are we reunited than we
must part again Like the Bible
story I’m sure there has to be a
Bible story where that happens

DAVID
(to MR MICAWBER)
Were you aware I studied at Mrs
Strong’s before you came here

MR MICAWBER
Not as I recall I had perhaps a
dim awareness of the more recent
chapters in your odyssey but

DAVID
But your being here as a professor
in the same building as me

MR MICAWBER
Pure kismet and happenstance “As
flies to wanton boys are we to the
gods” to quote our ultimate poet

COACH DRIVER
All aboard who’s going aboard

MRS MICAWBER boards with the CHILDREN MR MICAWBER puts a
hand on DAVID’s shoulder It’s fatherly

MR MICAWBER
I do wonder I have found the
funds to pay for my family’s
travel but my own fare is lacking

Behind MICAWBER is a chalked sign ‘Canterbury to London £1’

MR MICAWBER (CONTD)
Might I possibly trouble you

DAVID
»no trouble

MR MICAWBER
for the exact sum

DAVID
-of course

DAVID takes out a pound note

MR MICAWBER
--of four pounds ten and
thruppence

MICAWBER clocks the £1 sign and makes a too-late attempt to
cover it He aborts the mission half way through putting his
hand up A weary beat from DAVID who hands over the money

DAVID
Safe travels

A beat of recognition they both know what just happened
Then MICAWBER is back to his old self

MICAWBER
(climbing onto the coach
it pulls away)
We are quadrilaterally concluded
In short square

MRS MICAWBER
(pleased)
Geometry Goodbye young sir Until
we meet again

As the coach disappears DAVID sees URIAH across the street
Traffic keeps passing so they have to wait to speak

URIAH
I imagine you have forgotten

DAVID
Tea No I

Traffic

URIAH
Why on earth should you remember
people of our station We have a
nerve to expect it

DAVID
I haven’t forgotten

Traffic Then when the traffic clears URIAH is gone DAVID
depressed angry Rips up MICAWBER’s IOU Turns to see the
BUTCHER’S BOY and his ASSISTANT delivering meat from a
handcart further down the street DAVID fired up goes over
Pulls back his arm to thump the BUTCHERS BOY but
immediately gets a shoulder of lamb in the face

meat
INT THE HEEPS’ HOUSE - DAY 112

URIAH and his MOTHER in their sparsely furnished but neat
and clean house sat on a large round table covered in tea
things including a bottle of milk A pile of law books The
odd ornament DAVID has a red mark on one side of his face

DAVID
A leg of lamb I believe

MRS HEEP
(checking the mark)
No That looks more like a half
shoulder Or a big bit of brisket
(offering cake)
Cake It’s quite heavy

URIAH
I like a heavy cake I like to know
I’ve had a cake

MRS HEEP
He can’t abide a light sponge

DAVID

I see

(takes a piece struggles

to cut into it)
Well this looks very

(eats - Jesus)
---good Lord That’s wonderfully
dense

MRS HEEP moves her chair closer to DAVID A moment later so
does URIAH DAVID uncomfortable Looks around

DAVID (CONTD)
I see you’re studying Mr Heep

URIAH
Uriah if you can bear to Yes
improving my legal knowledge I am
hopeful that Mr Wickfield might be
willing to take me on as an
apprentice at law

DAVID
Perhaps you’ll become a partner

URIAH
Do you mock me

DAVID
You seem to search for mockery
That was meant sincerely Uriah

URIAH

(overexcited)
Uriah Did you hear that He
called me Uriah

MRS HEEP
I did

URIAH
Spontaneously

MRS HEEP
And him a gentleman

URIAH
It’s like the blowing of old
breezes to hear you say Uriah
It thrills me to the very stomach

DAVID
(checking the clock)
I’m happy for you

URIAH
Time is a concern Are you worried
humbleness is an infectious

disease
DAVID
No no I just can’t stay too
long
MRS HEEP
You can if I bar the door
URIAH
We could keep him as our little
pet
DAVID

I beg your pardon
URIAH realises hes gone too far

URIAH
Sorry it’s a joke Forgive me
I’ve been attempting to learn
Gentlemen’s Humour from a book

MRS HEEP
He has What do you think of Mr
Wickfield

Both HEEPS shift chairs in exact unison closer to DAVID

DAVID
He isa good man I feel

URIAH
He takes wine with an enviable
degree of enjoyment don’t he

DAVID
Ive seen him take wine but

URIAH
Youve seen him That’s good to
know interesting to know - that
youve witnessed the deed

DAVID
‘Witnessed the deed’

URIAH and MRS HEEP nudge closer This time they move the
place settings they left behind with previous shifts

URIAH
Your associate the Professor He’s
a sort isn’t he

DAVID
Is he

MRS HEEP
Lodging with a beggar is that a
London particular

DAVID
Mr Micawber isn’t a

(off a look from URIAH)
More tea

MRS HEEP exits to the kitchen with the teapot URIAH nudges
even closer A beat

URIAH
I had an interesting talk with
Micawber as I was showing him out

DAVID
Did you

URIAH
Fascinating your time in London
(calling clinking milk)
Mother Bring another bottle of
milk through This bottle is almost
empty and another bottle is needed

DAVID
You seem very vexed by this bottle

URIAH
Your friend Steerforth is damning
of the humbler classes A veritable
factory of damnation How would you
like to help me secure a position
with Mr Wickfield

DAVID
(gets close)
I know you told Steerforth about
Micawber’s I0Us I’ve a mind to
throw this cake at you and break a
rib

URIAH
Youre very fond of violence
aren’t you

DAVID gets up to leave MRS HEEP comes in with a tray of tea
milk huge fruitcake

MRS HEEP
More heavy cake
URIAH
Ahh Lovely
MRS HEEP
(to DAVID)

You must take some home with you

EXT STREET OUTSIDE THE HEEP’S HOUSE - DUSK 113

DAVID leaves the Heep house with a large slice of cake He’s
angry Throws the cake into a metal bucket with a massive
clang He strides back towards school with some
determination

EXT MRS STRONG’S SCHOOL - SIDE OF BUILDING - DUSK 114
A little later The mark on DAVID’s face has gone down

DAVID storms up to STEERFORTH Some hand-carts taking boys’
luggage away LITTIMER Steerforth’s Butler carries out some
of his bags through a side door

DAVID
Steerforth Micawber’s harmless He
cared for my well-being for years

STEERFORTH
The rogue was exploiting your
charitable nature You should be
thanking me Daisy

DAVID
My name is David Not Daisy not
Trot my name is David Copperfield

STEERFORTH
Then why not go by it What else
are you hiding David

DAVID
Well I can’t hide anything when
youve got your spindly little spy
Heep searching my possessions

STEERFORTH
My instinct is to protect you
because you can’t protect yourself

DAVID
Yes I can

STEERFORTH
A malnourished apprentice knocked
you out cold

DAVID goes to hit STEERFORTH BOYS watch from the windows

STEERFORTH (CONTD)
What was that It was like you were
reaching for a Chelsea bun

DAVID strikes STEERFORTH again who instinctively hits DAVID
back on the bottom with his cane DAVID yelps

DAVID
And that was like an ageing dowager
poking a fire

STEERFORTH
What does that even mean You’re
just a bag of words

DAVID
What is it What’s in you that
makes you like this

STEERFORTH
I don’t know
(drops arms to his sides)
Go on Hit me I deserve to be hit

DAVID
I don’t want to hit you
STEERFORTH
Hit me In the face
DAVID
No
STEERFORTH

I’m sorry I’m forever doing this -
I make a dear friendship and then I
tread it into the dirt

DAVID
No We’re still dear friends We
always shall be

They sit on a trunkbench

STEERFORTH
Forgive me if I went too far with
the Pretend Professor Truly It’s
upset you and I’m sorry

DAVID
Thank you

STEERFORTH
I’m fretting And angry Mother is
due and I always get this odd
feeling whichI don’t know

from damp logs

umbrella over MRS STEERFORTH to shield her from drips She
glares at the interior as she goes

They pass holes in the walls There are BOYS behind sections
of the wall holding it up and covering holes with similarly
coloured material These are removed a moment after MRS
STEERFORTH passes - we catch a glimpse of a LITTLE BOY’s head
through a hole before it disappears

As they turn the corner we return to a normal frame rate
MRS STRONG
We intend when further funds

clear to improve the building

MRS STEERFORTH
How By demolishing it

Haha Very droll Mrs Steerforth

for their carriages through a gap in the hedge WICKFIELD is
with AGNES who looks different new dress and hairstyle

MRS STRONG

so our intake of new boys for the

head past towards the bar

STEERFORTH
This is a very poor play I wanted

MARKHAM
Or a horse

STEERFORTH
(to AGNES)
Hello sis

They go into the bar

AGNES
You were saying

barely the energy to

out from the bar and leave the theatre

DAVID
(to AGNES but looking at
his departing friends)
Be very careful of the Heep and his
cake-mother

AGNES
They’re becoming a fixture Don’t

need to go to bed Good night

She heads back into the box The HEEPS and WICKFIELD are
returning too - WICKFIELD draining a glass of wine MRS HEEP
replacing it immediately with a full one

of the bed)
Ever tried to pluck a pear before
it was ripe They all ripen in the
end They only want attending to

DAVID tries to grab URIAH misses

DAVID
You’re not worthy of that woman
(slightly incoherent)
I hold Agnes so far above you and
your aspirations as that moon
herself

URIAH
I have as good a right to her as
any other man Better I pulled
myself up with no help from you
doing whatever it iswhat is it
youre being trained to become

DAVID
A proctor

URIAH
Indeed Now I’m hardly whatever
one of them is but I deserve her
I will go to any ends for her

DAVID

You may go to the devil

He falls on to the bed passes out URIAH puts the cushion on
his seat rests

URIAH
Don’t say that I know you’1ll be
sorry afterwards

loaded with possessions protestingcrying DEBTORS
dismissive BAILIFFS

gesture indicates But if we’re

Well the day before yesterday she
said “Dick I am ruined” And I
said “Oh indeed” And then we
travelled here and had bottled
porter and sandwiches

DAVID
(frustrated with MR DICK)
That’s not a lot of light Do you
understand what ruin means

MR DICK smiles and nods Then stops smiling shakes his head

DAVID (CONTD)
It means distress and want And
starvation

DAVID immediately regrets what he said MR DICK starts taking
pieces of buttered toast and putting them in his pockets

MR DICK
Oh dear What can we do Trotwood
(to himself)
“By what earthly power do you
condemn me By what authority”

DAVID
Well get your kite in the air Mr
Dick and banish any sad thoughts
to the skies Agreed Now let’s
try to keep a cheerful countenance

MR DICK
Agreed Cheerful

putting some sugar cubes in his breast pocket

INT WICKFIELD and HEEP OFFICES - DAY 148

DAVID is opposite MR WICKFIELD who sits behind his desk A
subdued AGNES enters the room carrying a tray covered with a
cloth which she sets down

WICKFIELD
We will ensure this cannot happen
again Although that’s problematic
given I’ve no idea how it happened
in the first place - I’d never
authorise such a reckless document

DAVID
(gently)
And yetthis is your signature

AGNES
You did all you could Currently we
all have to do the dutiful thing

DAVID
What does that mean Do you feel
some personal duty towards Uriah

No answer from AGNES

WICKFIELD
I can offer you a crumb of comfort
Trotwood In fact more than a
crumb an entire batch loaf - we’ll
approve a loan to tide you over

DAVID
Thank you And I promise repayment
will occur just as soon as

URIAH
‘Something turns up’

URIAH has entered holding a square object wrapped in cloth
and a DISTINCTIVE BRIEFCASE which he then locks in a bureau

URIAH (CONTD)
(locking the bureau)
With respect Mr Wickfield a more
sober judgement is required when
considering a loan of this nature

WICKFIELD
I am sober

URIAH
MastMister Copperfield a loan
is out of the question Apologies

WICKFIELD
(getting up)
Mr Heep we should discuss this

DAVID
Do you have authority here Uriah

URIAH
(sits in WICKFIELD’s seat)
I do And it’s Mr Heep As in
‘Wickfield and Heep’ I’m a partner

He reveals a new PLAQUE from beneath the cloth ‘WICKFIELD and
HEEP’ ‘HEEP’ is a font-size bigger

URIAH (CONTD)
Agnes Could you

AGNES uncovers the tray which has a decanter of sherry and
some glasses WICKFIELD feigns enthusiasm

WICKFIELD
We are drinking to the firm hand of
Mr Heep grasping - or co-grasping -
the tiller

URIAH
All of us man and woman can
benefit from having a partner do
you not agree Agnes

AGNES
In times of trouble we must all
dothat which we must do

AGNES starts to pour MRS HEEP enters with a tray of cakes
MRS HEEP
Small heavy cakes to go with the
sherry Like tasty billiard balls

MR WICKFIELD goes to take a sherry A look from URIAH to
AGNES and she takes it off him Takes a sherry to DAVID

URIAH and MRS HEEP drink and celebrate marveling at the new
sign MR WICKFIELD remains in his seat away from the desk
DAVID whispers to AGNES

DAVID
(re URIAH and MRS HEEP)
Those two are weeds I’ve seen
their like before Unchecked
they’1l overrun and choke all life
and joy from this place They must
be stopped

AGNES
I fear the time for that has
passed Now we must all make what
shift we can

URIAH proposes a toast

URIAH
To partnerships

He crosses to AGNES gets very close MRS HEEP gives DAVID
her mini cakes

A beat

MRS HEEP
I’ve given you two cakes I know
how you love my cake

DAVID
Cake

URIAH
I’m far too humble to say I’ve
saved this firm but

AGNES
Uriah has been very good for our
business

WICKFIELD
He has been diversifying into
smaller rental properties

URIAH
-in parts of London that aren’t
necessarily first choice

DAVID
And this is to be my only choice

URIAH
There is a category of persons who
famously cannot be choosers

URIAH (0S)
And you with her

Quickly packing before they lose their belongings to the

circumstances

URIAH
Of course

DAVID
At least we won’t get lost in here

BETSEY TROTWOOD
There isn’t room enough to swing a
cat

MR DICK
Good I don’t want to swing a cat

BETSEY gives DICK a little smile

URIAH
You can’t fly your kite in here

MR DICK
I don’t fly it indoors anyway It
can’t fly in a house No breeze

URIAH
I bow to your expertise

DAVID
He can’t fly his kite but he could
swat an irritant

URIAH
Well enjoy your lodgings If any
problems arise I suggest you tend
to them yourselves

He exits MR DICK tries to stretch but can’t

BETSEY TROTWOOD
We’ll make do Ale for me now It’s

I wish to make a contribution

MR DICK puts out a handkerchief dumps it into BETSEY’s lap
Some coins buttons bits of string marbles and sweets spill
out BETSEY is moved DAVID still pacing

MR DICK (CONTD)

No I’m not

MR DICK
I mean more particularly you’re
not

DAVID
King Charles the First

to get a good run with my kite

At a road junction MR DICK goes to carry straight on

DAVID
Ah - can’t go that way Mr Dick The
gentleman who makes my waistcoats
is up there and I haven’t been able
to fully clear my debt with him

malnourished

doorway further down the street by some fruit boxes

MR MICAWBER pulls himself up slightly now lounging like a
Roman

DAVID
Do you live on the streets now

MR MICAWBER
We do currently exist primarily al
fresco with all the advantages
that entails

MR DICK gets down beside MICAWBER lounging next to him

DAVID notices that the HOMELESS MAN whom we saw take DAVID’s
bag is now lying in the doorway along from MICAWBER He is
covered in a filthy quilt made of DAVID’s fancy waistcoats

MR MICAWBER
David Might you help me

DAVID
(crouches down)
What assistance do you need

MR MICAWBER
I popped my concertina with the
Floral Street pawnbroker I’d like
it back but he knows me and he’1l

BETSEY TROTWOOD
We were sadly not able to express a
preference

She grabs some KIDS DAVID looks around at his cramped flat
He’s pained by the chaos he sees and what has happened to
his life BETSEY and MR DICK clock his distress

MR DICK
You really should write a story

cracking tale

There was no adventure at the pawn

Outside we hear BETSEY MR DICK but mostly the MICAWBERS We
stay on DAVID looking into a mirror The room is dark behind
his reflection DAVID trying out facial expressions mouths
words eyes sparkling He becomes MRS STEERFORTH

DAVID
This tea will not be removed from
the table until he returns

MRS STEERFORTH herself now appears beside a tea table
covered in cobwebs wearing a cobwebbed dress The room now
matches the colour of her home She says the words
simultaneously

MRS STEERFORTH
This tea will not be removed from
the table until he returns

With her now is YOUNG DAVID scared MRS STEERFORTH touches
her heart

DAVID MRS STEERFORTH (CONTD)
What do I touch What do I touch

set but dirtier and more ragged and begging for food

YOUNG DAVID
I’m desperate with hunger I want
more sir Please sir

Then STEERFORTH appears in another area looking slightly
different

STEERFORTH
I wish to God I had been guided to
a far far better fate

Then a light on Murdstone in yet another area

MURDSTONE
What I want is Facts No

As good a promissory note as any
issued from Threadneedle Street

A knock on the door A head comes round It’s the real

WICKFIELD and MR DICK enter

WICKFIELD
This doesn’t feel like a party

URIAH
Should I make us a bowl of punch
We need a lemon - Miss Trotwood

BETSEY TROTWOOD
If I had a lemon Heep I’d squirt
the juice in your eyes You’ve
embezzled funds from this firm

URIAH
Slander Who else wishes to defame
me

MICAWBER enters with PEGGOTTY

MR MICAWBER
I do I put it to you that - for
your own pecuniary aggrandisement -
you falsified documents to mystify
an individual whom I will designate
in code as ‘Mr W’

URIAH
Wickfield

MR MICAWBER
-Maybe

AGNES
There’s no need for the code Mr
Micawber

URIAH
Prove it You can’t

AGNES
To prove it we would need access to
certain documents

DAVID
But Agnes - wherever might we find
such documents

AGNES
I believe they used to be in that
bureau

DAVID
Used to be

URIAH gets up and rushes to a bureau in the corner unlocks
it looks for his briefcase Roots around panicky Nothing

URIAH
(trying to appear calm)
All youve proved is that you’re
thieves You stole those documents

DAVID
Stole Can Mr Wickfield’s daughter
not tidy up her father’s papers

URIAH
They were in a locked drawer

AGNES
I’m a very enthusiastic tidier

PEGGOTTY

clue)
Swans

MR DICK

I was studying these last night

(pause as if that was it)
Oh yes When Mr Wickfield signs his
name the ‘W’ looks like a swan
But when Mr Heep mimics the
signature his ‘W’ is more like a
church bell Or an upturned hip
bath

A cheer from the room The attention off him URIAH moves to
AGNES gradually making his way towards the door

DAVID
Well done Mr Dick

BETSEY TROTWOOD
Mr Dick cracks it again

WICKFIELD

calamity Heep A thousand curses

charity on you And you Miss T

BETSEY slaps URIAH Then URIAH slaps BETSEY Then BETSEY
slaps URIAH Then URIAH goes to slap BETSEY again but DAVID
floors him with a punch

PEGGOTTY
Now stove his head in with a cake

MRS HEEP goes to tend to URIAH

dentist on Monday to have a tooth

him and STEERFORTH flinches scared of HAM STEERFORTH mouths
something inaudible maybe ‘I’m sorry’ HAM tries to tether
his rope to STEERFORTH just as a huge wave swallows them

DAVID on stage completes his story

DAVID
And now I have nothing left to
tell unless indeed I were to
confess that this narrative is far
more than mere fiction - it is my
written memory The people within
it are as real as earth and my
truest hope is that I might grow
half as strong and wise in the
telling of their lives as they
have grown in the living of them

He closes the book and bows to applause

A bright sunny day in the garden DAVID is introducing his
new SIX-MONTH-OLD SON to the TODDLER GIRL we saw at the
theatre Shapes and colours like in the opening scene They
form into a crowd of people eating and drinking - including
AGNES WICKFIELD the MICAWBERS BETSEY and MR DICK (with his
kite from earlier) and others we don’t know played by as
many of the cast who can make it

A SMALL BOY hangs a sign on the back of MR DICK It’s DAVID’s
old ‘He Bites’ sign amended to read ‘He Kites’

MR DICK
Kite as a verb Splendid

We drift past PEGGOTTY and DANIEL PEGGOTTY eating snacks

Congratulations on the book

Odd to think my words bought this
house
WICKFIELD

A fine depiction of that villain
Heep I think we both played a
pretty clever game to catch that
fellow Canny minds you and I

DAVID
Well done us

WICKFIELD beams a confident smile DAVID hands the BABY to
PEGGOTTY - now wearing BETSEY’s BROACH - who stands with
DANIEL PEGGOTTY

MRS MICAWBER
You also saved myself Wilkins and
our angels from the streets

DAVID
Your presence in my writing has
repaid me many times over

MR MICAWBER
Luckily I’m at present between paid
jobs so that has allowed us the
freedom to travel down to your
beautiful home The coach fare

MRS MICAWBER
Well we barely considered the
cost

MR MICAWBER
Indeed Barely considered it

DAVID gives a bank note to MICAWBER who goes to write
IOU DAVID shakes his head no need He heads into the
