Is it wonderful
LEMARCHAND
Wonderful

GENEVIEVE
(smiling)
Are you brilliant

LEMARCHAND
(returning the smile)
The finest toymaker in France

They both laugh affectionately Beneath their words and their
smiles though is an undercurrent of what Anxiety
Uncertainty Perhaps they both sense Phillip is involved in
something that he doesn’t quite understand

GENEVIEVE
What does it do

Proudly Lemarchand manipulates the Box through various
positions until at a certain point the mechanisms within
seem to take over and it moves itself into the final swastika-
like configuration familiar from the previous films

and remains sitting on Lemarchand’s hand No chains no
hooks no blue lights no screams of pain or pleasure

The interested smile on Genevieve’s face falters

GENEVIEVE
Oh (beat) It doesn’t actually do anything then

LEMARCHAND
(stung into cold defensiveness)
It all but defies the laws of physical geometry It’s my
masterpiece You simply couldn’t understand

GENEVIEVE
I meant no offense Phillip I’m sure it’s terribly intricate
It’s just dull I prefer your acrobats and lovers

Laughing disarmingly she crosses to the shelves and activates
some of the older automata The monkey musician begins to saw

at his fiddle Harlequin kisses Columbine who hides her blush
behind a fan The Clown swings over and around his trapeze

Lemarchand far from placated is standing and fastening a
cloak around himself

LEMARCHAND
I was working to a commission To very specific requests The
Duke has what he wanted

Genevieve registers the cloak as Lemarchand heads for the
door
GENEVIEVE
It’s midnight Where are you going

LEMARCHAND
The Chateau Du Reve to deliver the box

GENEVIEVE
Now Why

LEMARCHAND
Because my work might be appreciated there And it is the
appointed hour

Opening the door Box in hand he sweeps from the room

Genevieve watches the door close behind him

GENEVIEVE
The appointed hour -— Midnight Aristocrats (cont)
EXT THE CHATEAU DU REVE MIDNIGHT

A magnificent mansion stands in its own grounds Below its
lawns is a front gate A SHADOWY FIGURE hovers at the gate - a
beggar or derelict of some kind The camera moves to show

Lemarchand at the impressive front door of the Chateau

GENEVIEVE

(off)
(cont) Such strange people

The door is opened by JACQUES a 19 year-old servant-cum-
apprentice to the Chateau’s owner - who stands behind him the
powdered and periwigged DUC DE L’ISLE
De L’Isle’s age is hard to determine beneath the layers of
white powder that cover his face but the red and rheumy eyes
and spidery limbs suggest he is at least in his late 50’
From somewhere in the house a clock tolls midnight

DE’ L’ ISLE

Lemarchand steps over the threshold

INT CHATEAU DU REVE HALLWAY NIGHT (CONT )

into the hall - candle-lit its outer reaches lost in
shadow There’s an impression of decay beneath the finery a
bright light would probably show peeling paint and cobwebs
De L’Isle’s eyes glitter as he looks at the Box in
Lemarchand’s hand Beckoning he leads him across the hall
toward a room

DE L’ ISLE
Come Someone is eager to meet you

Lemarchand follows his manner nervous He is a middle-class
artisan in the house of an aristocrat

Jacques closes the door and looks at Lemarchand and De L’Isle

as they walk away There is a look in his eyes covetous
ambitious and secretive
INT CHATEAU DU REVE GAME ROOM NIGHT (CONT )

A room lit by many candles providing a rich atmosphere of
contrasting orange light and flickering black shadows

EIGHT CARDPLAYERS - male four finely-attired the other four
in military uniform - sit at a large table A game in progress
halts as the players look up as De L’Isle and lLemarchand
enter

DE L’ ISLE
A moment gentlemen forgive me Madame

A stunningly beautiful woman emerging from the shadows at the
room’s end moves to De L’Isle and Lemarchand

This is the PRINCESS ANGELIQUE Dark mysterious exquisite

DE L’ ISLE
Phillip Lemarchand - The Princess Angelique

Angelique extends her hand Lemarchand - visibly struck by her
beauty - bends to kiss it As he straightens he finds himself
the subject of a penetrating stare and a ravishing smile

ANGELIQUE
Your fame precedes you toymaker

DE L’ ISLE
The Princess is your true patron Lemarchand The Box was her
conception your employment her idea

Lemarchand places the Box in the hands of Angelique

LEMARCHAND
Though the box is unworthy of your beauty Princess I pray
its amusements be worthy of your attention

ANGELIQUE
I thank you sir And I pray your workmanship is as elegant as
your tongue
Phillip glows in the warmth of her smile and her words His
face falls however as she instantly turns to De L’Isle

ANGELIQUE
(flatly unsmiling)
Pay him

She turns without another word and moves back into the room
leaving De L’Isle amused at Phillip’s obvious disappointment

DE L’ ISLE
Never mistake your superior’s politeness for affection
toymaker And never forget your place

The sound of a firmly closing door bridge the CUT TO

EXT THE CHATEAU DU REVE NIGHT

Lemarchand walks away from the closed front door his brush
with the rich and powerful abruptly over The path takes him
past the lit windows of the game room He looks in

INT CHATEAU DE REVE GAME ROOM NIGHT (CONT )

Jacques fills glasses at a drinks-table His secretive eyes
constantly scour the room — observing recording learning

At the card-table with Angelique De L’Isle claps his hands
for attention and the Players look up at them We get a
clearer look at the Players now and some sense of their
personalities

CORBUSIER - the natural leader Rakishly good-looking
Sardonic smile Cruel eyes D’Artagnan with a bad attitude

DELVAUX - De L’Isle’s age but fat ruddy and libidinous

L’ESCARGOT - thin pinched and cold Efficient and amoral In
his next incarnation an accountant at Auschwitz

DE CONDUITE - a dandy An effeminate heterosexual Knows a lot
about ladies’ fashions Probably collects snuff-boxes

L’HIVER PRINTEMPS L’AUTOMME and L’ETE - young army officers
earning the ways of the world from these decadent companions

DE L’ ISLE
Gentlemen A new game

Angelique holds the Box up to their collective gaze and hands
it to D L’Isle who passes it on to Corbusier A secret look
passes between Angelique and De L’Isle - his full of
expectation hers full of promise

EXT THE CHATEAU DU REVE NIGHT (CONT

Through the window Lemarchand sees Corbusier take the Box
The card-player’s mouth moves as if making some comment and we
see laughter from his fellows It is clear that though
Lemarchand can see the action in the room he can’t hear
anything

INT CHATEAU DU REVE GAME ROOM NIGHT (CONT )

De L’Isle smiles at whatever witticism Corbusier made
DE L’ ISLE
Come sir We are all players here Do we laugh at challenges

or except them

Corbusier weighs the Box in his hand

CORBUSIER
And what would be the challenge here De L’Isle To name this
frippery How about “The Arabian Dice” - for it is as

filligreed as a Moorish temple and as simple as a child’s toy

Amidst the laughter of his fellow players he rolls it on to
the table in contemptuous parody of throwing a dice

Angelique snatches it up Her icy voice stills the laughter

ANGELIQUE
It already has a name sir The Lament Configuration And as
to being simple - It’s complexity I wager is beyond your
skill
CORBUSIER

(looking her up and down)
A pretty name Madame Are the stakes you would offer as
attractive

The others giggle at the lascivious implication in his words

Angelique silences them with a freezing glance and then -
playing them perfectly - allows a coy smile to blossom on her
face She holds the Box up again

ANGELIQUE
The Box looks solid Gentlemen but in skilful hands may be
unlocked and maneuvered Pass it among yourselves For every
successful stripping of its secrets I shall respond in
kind

To appreciative murmurs from the players Angelique raises the
Box to her lips and kisses it

ANGELIQUE
Now it is complete Will you play Sir

She proffers it to Corbusier who takes it eagerly and begins
to manipulate it searching for its secrets
The eyes of the players are fixed on his efforts - so they
miss the secret smile that passes between Angelique and De
L’Isle And all of them are blind to the rapt attention of
Jacques

CORBUSIER
Ah There you are

The Box clicks to a different position Looking up he passes
the Box carelessly to Delvaux his expectant eyes on
Angelique

Nodding in acknowledgement Angelique undoes some catches and
removes her dress It’s 1784 so there are still several
layers of undergarments to go Nevertheless her action draws
smiles from the players and sends Delvaux eagerly to work

EXT THE CHATEAU DU REVE NIGHT (CONT )

Lemarchand’s jaw drops as he sees Angelique disrobe
(INTERCUT to Lemarchand at various points through the “game”)

INT CHATEAU DU REVE GAME ROOM NIGHT (CONT )

Delvaux works as his fellows watch quoffing drinks or taking
snuff L’Escargot is next but it’s De Conduite who calls out

DE CONDUITE
Time sir time Pass it on

L’Escargot reaches for the Box but Delvaux snatches it away

DELVAUX
No I’ve nearly There

The Box moves to another setting All eyes turn lustfully to
Angelique to obligingly removes the first of her petticoats

DE L’ ISLE
Play on Play on

L’Escargot takes up the Box and begins
MONTAGE —

- The Box moving from hand to hand from position to
position

- Angelique removing succesive layers of clothing
- Increasingly-flushed and excited faces

- A secret excitement growing in De L’Isle’s eyes
- Jacques watching as excited as his master
- Lemarchand’s face beyond the glass fascinated and shocked

Finally the Box comes back to the hands of Corbusier He
looks at Angelique - now clad only in a corset and bloomers

CORBUSIER
It occurs to me Madame that should there be more secrets on
the table than on the floor we will need fresh inducement for
our endeavours

ANGELIQUE
Oh there are always more secrets sir Always more surprises
Now - will you talk or will you play
Viciously Corbusier twists at the Box seeking one more
configuration and finds it The Box flies from his hands to

the centre of the table - and begins to move itself

CORBUSIER
What

The players all stare in fascination at the moving Box

ANGELIQUE
As I say Always more secrets But a wager is a wager

She begins to loose the catches of her corset

De L’Isle moves to stand with Jacque

NTERCUT the Box’s movements with the loosening of the corset
The Box clicks into a penultimate position and BLUE LIGHT
glows bright from within it and through the seams at its
sides

Lemarchand is shocked The Box has secrets its maker didn’t

suspect Before he can see more the drapes suddenly FALL SHUT
against the window - as if something knows he’s watching

The players don’t notice breath held their eyes are on
Angelique as she opens her corset to reveal herself

Her torso transforms -— suddenly it is covered in a score of
SCREAMING MOUTHS and DEMONIC EYES that stare balefully out
into the room Her FLESH RIPPLES in constant motion as if full
of impossible life

Instantly the room is full of the AMPLIFIED SOUND OF DEMONIC
WHISPERS and bathed in BLUE LIGHT Angelique’s skin takes a
blue tone and her eyes turn completely BLACK The movements on
her chest culminate in a GAPING WOUND that opens there
Amid CRIES OF HORROR AND FEAR from the cardplayers the Box
clicks into its final position streaming BLUE LIGHT

and the room explodes into hellish and unnatural life

- The entire room TREMBLES as if caught in a quake

- Unearthly WINDS explode up from the floor sending the candle
flames shooting upwards in powerful RED FIRE casting

NIGHTMARE SHADOWS on the walls

- Hellish RESTRAINTS shoot from the chairs twisting around
the players’ limbs trapping them in place

- Overhead a LARGE WROUGHT-IRON CANDLEABRA hanging from the
ceiling moves into a new shape its eight rococo arms

straightening out into viciously SHARP AND POWERFUL LANCES

The players look up in horror at what has become a killing
machine overhead

and the CANDLEABRA falls from the ceiling each of its
eight arms heading unerringly for the body of a card-player

CLOSE on the back and base of a chair as a SPIKE smashes
through it followed by a gush of BLOOD as we SMASH-CUT TO

EXT THE CHATEAU DU REVE NIGHT (CONT )

Lemarchand is some feet back from the curtained window his
face a mask of horror at the TERRIBLE SOUNDS from within the
room and the NIGHTMARE SHADOWS playing on the heavy drapes

Now suddenly and explosively the large window SHATTERS
OUTWARD in a massive explosion of light and sound

Terrified Lemarchand turns and flees down the garden with the
panic-fuelled speed of a man who fears hell is at his heels

From the gate he turns into the street and passes the Shadowy
Figure we glimpsed earlier We now see it’s A DERELICT with a
handcart loaded with junk and curios The Derelict grabs him

DERELICT
Delicacies sir Spices of the orient Wonders from beyond the
sea

Lemarchand shakes himself free and runs shouting back

LEMARCHAND
No more wonders An end to wonders

The Derelict looks back at the Chateau blue light pulsing
from the windows And then the light goes out

INT CHATEAU DU REVE GAME ROOM NIGHT (CONT )

CLOSE on the Box as it clicks back into its normal position

WIDEN to reveal the room The Players’ chairs are vacant one
or two fallen over as the only testimony to what took place

Jacques is looking at De L’Isle his face vilely excited

DE L’ ISLE
Are you not apprenticed to a great magician Jacque

JACQUE
There is indeed great magic sir

But Jacques’s looking at Angelique as he says it

De L’Isle picks up a chair and rights it He smiles at
Angelique also back to normal and holding the Box

DE L’ ISLE
A fine game Princess

ANGELIQUE
The first of many Sir I found a rare talent in Lemarchand

De L’Isle’s face becomes cold and imperious

DE L’ ISLE
Go to my room Madam and wait for me

Oddly Angelique nods turns and leaves
DE L’ ISLE
(to Jacques)
He who summons the magic commands the magic A lesson
Jacques

Jacques nods in understanding

INT THE SORBONNE ANATOMY CLASS PARIS MORNING

CLOSE ON a human arm as a scalpel slices it and a pair of
hands peel the flesh back revealing the musculature beneath

WIDEN TO REVEAL a big room its floor sawdust-covered and
blood-soaked and full of tables on each of which are SHEET-
COVERED CORPSES

At one table sleeves rolled up and working hard at his
dissection is AUGUSTE DE MARAIS a 30 year old professor of
science and philosophy He has no’ students with him but only
his friend Lemarchand Auguste is smiling broadly having jus
heard Lemarchand’s story

(Auguste continues his efficient preparation of the corpse
throughout their conversation)
AUGUSTE
A pity Mme De Beaumont is dead these four years You could
have sold her your story and given her another success to
match her “Beauty and the beast”

LEMARCHAND
It is no story Auguste I saw what I saw heard what I heard
The Box opens the doors of Hell

AUGUSTE
This is the eighteenth century not the dark ages The world
is ruled by Reason We’ve even got rid of God And if there is
no Heaven then it follows reasonably that there is no Hell

LEMARCHAND
I was at its very window last night

Auguste looks at his friend hears the conviction in his
voice

AUGUSTE
Very well Suppose for the sake of argument that what you fear
happened happened A Box that opens the doors of Hell must be
able to close them

LEMARCHAND
Scant comfort Auguste The Box belongs to people with little
interest in closing such doors

AUGUSTE
Then the solution lies - literally - in your hands You
designed a machine that you fear can bring forth demons

LEMARC HAND
Yes

AUGUSTE
Then design a machine that can destroy them

As Auguste bends down to the difficult (and two-handed) task
of pulling the corpse’s rib-cage open Lemarchand stares at
his friend his eyes suddenly excited

CUT TO

INT LEMARCHAND’S WORKROOM AFTERNOON

The workbench is littered with papers filled with designs and
drawings They reveal a progression from the design of the
lament Configuration towards something else

Lemarchand works feverishly on a design which completes the
process The six faces of the Box are drawn at the edges of
the paper Lines from points on the faces meet in the centre
of the paper to form a shape From the Box itself has come its
own opposite The new shape while arising from the Box is
anti-thetical to it a cat’s-cradle of interconnecting and
curving lines rather than a solid and angular mass

Lemarchand runs his fingers over the shape in the centre of
the paper his eyes burning with the beginning of
understanding

GENEVIEVE
(off)
Phillip A visitor

Lemarchand looks up from his desk to the door Genevieve is
there and beside her Angelique - at the sight of whom
Lemarchand barely manages to conceal his gasp

LEMARC HAND
Princess

ANGELIQUE
Toymaker

A beat Angelique looks meaningfully to her side indicating
Genevieve’s presence

LEMARCHAND
Thank you Genevieve

More eye-language as Genevieve leaves - hers showing anger at
being asked to leave his trying to imply apology

Angelique watches the door close - and as Lemarchand gathers
up and turns over his drawings to keep them from her eyes she
quietly and secretly turns the key in the door to lock it

ANGELIQUE
Forgive this unannounced visit

LEMARCHAND
An honour A pleasure A A

Lemarchand is fumbling He’s afraid What does this visit
mean Though it’s daytime and Angelique is both polite and
beautiful his memory of last night is strong Angelique moves
further in an amused smile on her lips

ANGELIQUE
Do I make you nervous How delightful

LEMARCHAND
You took me by surprise I was working

ANGELIQUE
And what work you do Phillip May I call you Phillip (he
nods) And you must call me Angelique (a beat) Say it
(cont)
She’s moved very close to him now She’s almost whispering

ANGELIQUE
(cont) I want to watch your mouth make the shape of my name

The light in the room seems to have DIMMED to have coalesced
around them leaving the rest of the room LOST IN SHADOW This
isn’t flirtation This isn’t seduction This is hypnosis

Lemarchand is almost dizzy his fear forgotten

LEMARCHAND
Angelique

Her eyes fix on his lips as he says it She’s managed to make
just the saying of a name an intimate almost erotic act

ANGELIQUE
Good Now we’re friends I much prefer to do business with
friends

LEMARCHAND
Business Were you dissatisfied with the piece I made

ANGELIQUE
I was delighted Transformed I want more Phillip And so do
my masters (off his look) Men and women of power Ready to

reward genius Gold Fame The smiles of fair women

LEMARCHAND
I have a wife

ANGELIQUE
Oh Is that who that was Well Whatever My point is this I
can offer you a world which will appreciate a man of your
skills

LEMARCHAND
The Duke is rich I know but his influence is not so great

ANGELIQUE
De L’Isle (laughs) Forget him An initial contact that’s
all When I say “Power” I mean real power And when I say
“Reward” I mean real rewards

LEMARCHAND
Great rewards are usually accompanied by great risks

ANGELIQUE
Your caution is justified You will hear strange stories and
see strange sights But you are not in danger You are my
friend

She raises her hand to stroke delicately at his face
ANGELIQUE
Friends can share things Phillip Secret things Things even
wives needn’t know

Their eyes lock He leans forward as if to claim a kiss

GENEVIEVE
(off)
Phillip Phillip

CLOSE on the other side of the locked door - and Genevieve
playing with the handle concerned

Inside the mood changes instantly Angelique moves back
briskly into the room - which is suddenly brightly-lit again
everything back to normal - and heads for the door

Lemarchand head still spinning calls after her

LEMARCHAND
Angelique

She turns at the door smiling her hand on the key

ANGELIQUE
Yes

LEMARC HAND
Yes

ANGELIQUE
We shall make great things and see great wonders you and I
(a beat) Tonight The Chateau A masked ball Come Meet your
patrons Claim your future

She unlocks the door and opens it revealing Genevieve For a
beat the two women star at each other There’s a whole
conversation in their eyes And one of it’s polite

Angelique exits leaving Genevieve staring at her husband

EXT LEMARCHAND’S COTTAGE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER)

As Angelique walks from the front door she passes another
figure heading to it It is Auguste who as the ettiquette of
the times demand bows

Angelique acknowledges the bow but both stare at each other
curiously as if recognising in the other some kind of enmity
and as Auguste walks on to Lemarchand’s front door we CLOSE
IN on Angelique’s eyes drilling into his back full of a dark
and threatening promise

INT LEMARCHAND’S WORKROOM AFTERNOON

Lemarchand is gathering up his new sketches ripping them up
and trashing them Auguste’s voice stops him before he reaches
the finished design

AUGUSTE
What are you doing

LEMARCHAND
Coming to my senses You were right Fairy tales Tricks of
the light

AUGUSTE
Never enter politics Phillip Your skill at lying is
particularly poor

Auguste seats himself He notices a BLACK FEATHER on the
floor looks briefly puzzled and then looks at his friend

AUGUSTE
You had a visitor

LEMARCHAND
The Princess Angelique

AUGUSTE
Yes I rather thought it must have been (beat) Since we
spoke I have heard many whispers in town of the disappearance
of eight gamblers

LEMARCHAND
And this is evidence of what The Hell you don’t believe in

AUGUSTE
I’m an atheist not an idiot Evil is real whether it wears
horns and shakes a trident or flutters its eyelashes and
turns the heads of poor craftsmen

LEMARCHAND
Not poor for long Tonight I go to the Chateau To meet
patrons and win fame

AUGUSTE

Good (off Phillip’s surprised look) The good man must know
his enemy Must look it in the face and understand it

Auguste stands up and heads for the door
AUGUSTE
I shall meet you there tonight And tomorrow we shall both

meet the day with new evidence and new understanding

He leaves Lemarchand watches him and then looks to his work-
bench staring at the cat’s-cradle design

EXT WOODS NEAR PARIS LATE AFTERNOON

Auguste walks through a deserted wood The sunlight has a
strange quality - pregnant with darkness ready for twilight

A large BLACK BIRD flies and lands on a high branch It seems
to be staring at August

Auguste turns into a clearing and suddenly there is a WHOOSH
of sound and a FLURRY of movement

Auguste starts back with a gasp The movement resolves into AN
ACROBAT tumbling through the air in a cartwheel dive and
landing upright grinning madly a foot in front of Auguste

LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE draw Auguste’s eyes forward

Stretched between two trees is a painted-sheet backdrop
Before it a TROUPE OF CLOWNS the traditional figures of 18‘
century Commedia Dell’Arte HARELQUIN COLUMBINE PIERROT
PULCINELLA and THE SURGEON with four ACROBATS Their
costumes are even more exaggerated and bizarre than normal and
they all have strange half-smiles as if they posess a secret
knowledge Or are close to the borders of sanity

The Surgeon - a comically grotesque short man with tiny
glittering eyes and an absurdly full beard - walks forward

SURGEON
As the day is long sir an excellent surprise And most
welcome (he bows to Auguste) You have stumbled sir upon
Europe’s finest comedians

AUGUSTE
Comedians Here

On the branch the Black Bird observes the action

SURGEON
So it appears sir yes And should we be elsewhere

AUGUSTE
I have no idea I however should be I have a class to
teach

SURGEON
We too have an appointment sir But regrettably have eaten
our map (belches) Perhaps you could help Are you a local
man sir

The day is growing darker And there’s something increasingly
unsettling about the silent unwavering smiles of the Clowns

AUGUSTE
(nods)

I am Auguste de Marais Philosopher

SURGEON
Philosophy A fine trade and never to be confused with the
training of frogs which is — I speak from experience - a much
overrated profession

AUGUSTE
With respect I have no time to discuss the relative virtues
of men’s careers To where do you wish to be directed

SURGEON
To the Chateau Du Reve sir We are to perform at a great
masked ball

AUGUSTE
You are but a mile away Clear the wood and you shall see it

SURGEON
(speaking with gratitude)
Your kindness must be rewarded sir Players Prepare

The Clowns draw two TRUMPETS and a BASS DRUM from a sack

AUGUSTE
I thank you But you must excuse me

SURGEON
And leave you unsatisfied sir An unsatisfied audience is the
saddest thing in the world save a one-legged fish in a barrel
of pork

AUGUSTE
I assure you There is no need

SURGEON
But I insist

Suddenly from his coat the Surgeon produces two gleaming
BUTCHER’S KNIVES which he holds upright one in each hand

The Acrobat near Auguste does a back-flip and ends up behind
the startled Philosopher blocking his path

SURGEON
A brief diversion in your busy day sir An entertainment
entitled YOUR LAST SIGHT ON EARTH and guaranteed to please
(to troupe) Music

Pierrot and Pulcinella blow trumpets An Acrobat pounds the
drum The music is piercing and discordant

Another Acrobat somersaults swiftly to Auguste and held tight
by an Acrobat on each side he is carried to the backdrop

where Harlequin and Columbine are in a pantomime argument
Harlequin with angry looks and pointing fingers is accusing
Columbine with fervent eyes and imploring hands is denying
The acrobats bring Auguste on “stage” Columbine GASPS
Harlequin gestures at him accusingly

Columbine blushing prettily can deny no longer Staring at
Auguste her hands flutter over her heart and an exaggeratedly
dreamy look fills her face Yes this is her secret lover

AUGUSTE
Enough Let me go

Shocked Columbine and Harlequin put their fingers to their
lips One of the acrobats stuffs a small red ball in August’s
mouth to keep him quiet

The Black Bird keeps watching as the show continues

Harlequin confers silently with the Surgeon now on stage The
Surgeon sympathetic offers one of his knives Harlequin
looks at the knife at Auguste shakes his head The Surgeon
produces a duelling pistol from his pocket Harlequin shakes
his head The Surgeon tries again and produces a lobster and
some cheese Harlequin gives him a look The Surgeon has a
bright idea He points to the sheet backdrop Harlequin nods
excitedly and gestures to the two acrobats holding Auguste

The Acrobats lift Auguste up into the air his stifled CRIES
OF DENIAL coming from behind the ball-gag

A drum-roll and a flourish of a-tonal trumpets
Harlequin and the Surgeon each grasp a side of the sheet
The Acrobats swing Auguste through the air once twice
The backdrop sheet is whipped away

revealing a HUGE MAW OF HELL Denying physical reality it
stretches back into a dark infinity like an impossible tunnel
opened between dimensions Circular ribbed and pulsing it
resembles a GIANT OESOPHAGOUS The mouthentrance is a blur of
terrifying activity - hundreds of long sharp objects rotate
wildly like the blades of some VAST ORGANIC THRESHING MACHINE
The Black Bird beats its wings and flies from the branch

Auguste is hurled directly at the maw muffled SCREAMS OF
HORROR coming from his mouth limbs twitching in protest

The Troupe LAUGH and APPLAUD as we SMASH-CUT TO BLACK

EXT LEMARCHAND’S COTTAGE NIGHT

The BLACKNESS resolves into a NIGHT SKY above the cottage

INT LEMARCHAND’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Lemarchand eyes open is lying with his arm around Genevieve
who is asleep A beat and he takes his arm away slips
quietly from the bed and begins dressing in the semi-
darkness

He hasn’t got far before Genevieve sits up in bed

LEMARCHAND
I didn’t want to wake you I

GENEVIEVE
(interrupting)
You’ re as automatic as one of your toys She turns your key
and you perform

LEMARCHAND
You’ re being ridiculous You refuse to see what this could
mean for us

GENEVIEVE
I know what she means for us

LEMARCHAND
You’d have me turn my back on fortune because of some petty
female jealousy

GENEVIEVE
It isn’t that It isn’t just that It’s that place Those
people

LEMARCHAND
“Those people” are going to give me

GENEVIEVE
A son Because that’s what I’m going to give you Phillip A
son

A beat He stares at her anger replaced by incredulous
happiness He clambers on the bed to fling his arms round his
wife who is somewhere between laughter and tears at the
strength of his reaction

LEMARCHAND
This is wonderful Are you sure (off her happy nod) All the
more reason I must go

He kisses her forehead and leaves the bed again

GENEVIEVE
No You belong here With me With us

LEMARCHAND
We belong together But not here My son will be born ina
palace Built by the fortune I go to claim tonight
He flings the bedroom door open and is gone Genevieve stares
at the closed door distraught

GENEVIEVE
No No

INT CHATEAU DU REVE BALLROOM NIGHT

Lemarchand enters the Ballroom a space of smoke and laughter
and the chink of wine-glasses MUSICIANS play Jacques serves
drinks There are sixteen guests eight men eight women All
are elaborately MASKED but the eight men seem familiar - they
are the GAMBLERS

Lemarchand startled by the grotesque masks and drunken
laughter moves through the ballroom looking for Angelique

He sees movement through a connecting door and walks
through

a small table is the Box a few candles burning around it A
circular rug sits in the centre of the floor

Angelique’s there holding a thin wand connected to a bird-
mask in front of her face Her mask and costume are black and
featured reminding us of the bird that watched Auguste die

Lemarchand bows courteously She places her hand on his arm
and moves in very close to him

ANGELIQUE
I knew you’d come You’re a brave man Phillip

LEMARCHAND
Not so brave It would be a foolish man who ignored the
promise of success

ANGELIQUE
Then the world is full of fools

LEMARCHAND
Or empty of promise

ANGELIQUE
No The promise is everywhere Success is limited only by
desire The wise man sees that The brave man acts on it

LEMARCHAND
Then so far I may have been wise But not yet brave

Angelique tilts her beautiful head and pulls aside the mask

ANGELIQUE
Be brave

She’s irresistible Their mouths meet in a deep slow kiss

Suddenly THREE GUESTS in a drunken gavotte spill in from the
ballroom nearly colliding into them One of them spies
Angelique’s face We recognise the voice behind the mask

CORBUSIER
Ah Our Lady of the Labyrinth

Swept into formation she’s spun out of the room Lemarchand
dizzy from the kiss is startled by a VOICE from the shadows

DE L’ ISLE
(off)
What did she taste of toymaker

De L’Isle walks forward turning up the wick on an oil-lamp he
carries to show himself more clearly Unlike his guests he is
unmasked - though his face is twisted in suppressed rage

LEMARCHAND
My apologies you excellency I thought we were alone

DE L’ ISLE
Tasted sweet didn’t she Vanilla To hide the stench of
death Come here

Waving the oil-lamp he beckons Lemarchand to the middle of
the room He angles the light down toward the floor

and yanks away the circular rug revealing a large painted
pattern on the wooden slates - a five-pointed star within a
circle A Pentagram

DE L’ ISLE
That’s what your Box is designed to replace That and a few
words of Old Latin Such outmoded medieval methods

LEMARCHAND
Methods of what

DE L’ ISLE
(sneers)
You really don’t know what you’ve gotten yourself into do
you (a beat) Methods of summoning creatures from Hell
He lifts the light to their faces - his amused Lemarchand’s
appalled

H

T LEMARCHAND’S WORKROOM NIGHT

The camera roams moving to the workbench - where we see again
the cat’s-cradle design - and round to reveal Genevieve As
she scan’s the room looking at Phillip’s designs and
sketches she is putting on a cloak Her face is set ina
determined mask She’s going to fetch her husband back

INT CHATEAU DU REVE ANTE-ROOM NIGHT

The lamp is on the floor De L’Isle has picked up the Box and
is bouncing it in his hand as he walks towards Lemarchand who
backs away both describing a circle around the Pentagram

DE L’ ISLE
I introduced her to your skill Little did I know that your
science was to replace my magic

LEMARCHAND
You misunderstand The Princess has offered me more work
that’s all

DE L’ ISLE
There’d be no end of work toymaker no end of work They’re
full of ideas Always have been But they needed a human
genius to make their ideas manifest How they must have longed
for History to deliver them one such as you

Face creased with anger he hurls the Box at Lemarchand’s
face Lemarchand blocks it catches it and looks up to see
that De L’Isle has drawn a long and lethal dagger from his
belt

DE L’ ISLE
But I’m not ready to retire (gestures to the Pentagram)
That’s where I summoned her That’s where I’11 send her
back Once I’ve killed you

He lunges viciously Lemarchand throws himself back avoiding
the knife but losing his footing and falling to the floor

De L’Isle move sin towering menacingly above Lemarchand
and is suddenly seized from behind by Angelique whose

face is contorted in cold fury She grasps the knife hand and
SNAPS HIS WRIST easily

De L’Isle cries out in pain and cringes visibly backing away
as Angelique advances on him

ANGELIQUE
A true magician never forgets the rules A summoned demon is
yours to command forever - unless you stand in hell’s way
Hell needs this man And I no longer need you

She grasps De L’Isle by the throat and hoists him impossibly
high with one hand

and effortlessly flings him more than thirty feet to SMASH
through a glass window at the far end of the room

Almost as an afterthought she clicks her fingers

and magically the huge curtains gathered up to each side
of the window unfurl and close over the shattered glass

Lemarchand rises to his feet as she moves toward him

ANGELIQUE

Dancing with another Do you toy with my jealousy Phillip
(laughs)

Lemarchand isn’t laughing He backs away from her and into

the painted pattern of the Pentagram

Angelique freezes on the edge of the pattern It’s clear she
can’t - or won’t - enter She smiles beguilingly and holds her
arms out to Lemarchand

ANGELIQUE
I confess sir your kiss has confirmed the promise of your
eyes I burn for you my love Come to me

LEMARCHAND
(flat and final)
I think not Madame

Instantly the siren-side of Angelique disappears She drops
her arms and her smile and is all business

ANGELIQUE
Well To commerce You have a talent I have a fortune State
your terms

LEMARCHAND
I think not Madame

Angelique’s face clouds with cold fury

ANGELIQUE
Think again Sir

Lemarchand’s silence is eloquent
ANGELIQUE

Neither pleasure nor fortune persuades you Then we must try
something else
She clicks her fingers as she did before

Instantly the closed curtains fly open with a flourish like
the curtains of a theatre

and they don’t give on to a shattered window but to an
IMPOSSIBLY LONG CORRIDOR disappearing into a dark distance
And from it into the room comes the Troupe of Clowns Two
Acrobats blow discordant trumpets and two more beat bass
drums

Lemarchand stares in shock and fear as the Clowns produce
their knives and smile their maniac smiles

Suddenly one of the Acrobats frees his Bass Drum and rolls it
swiftly at Lemarchand It hits his feet falls to its side

and reveals that it’s made of HUMAN SKIN - and in the
middle still hideously recognisable are the STRETCHED AND
TORTURED FEATURES OF AUGUSTE

Lemarchand staggers back - and out of the Pentagram
Angelique steps in front of him her face creased in a
sadistic grin as the Clowns spread out into the room behind
her

Lemarchand’s eyes dart everywhere - judging distances

ANGELIQUE
And what do you think now sir

LEMARCHAND
I thank God my poor dead friend guided my hand to better work
this morning

ANGELIQUE
What do you mean

As he answers Angelique’s face clouds in fury and suspicion
LEMARCHAND
I mean that everything made may be unmade That everything

open may be closed

And suddenly he makes his break running madly for the door to
the Ballroom before any of the Clowns can reach him

But to the sound of Angelique’s demonic LAUGHTER the door
opens from the far side and the eight masked gamblers rush in

Lemarchand stops and stares at the gamblers

as they rip the masks from their faces revealing the
GROTESQUE PALLOR and HIDEOUS SCARS of their dead faces
ANGELIQUE
As promised gentlemen A new game

The faces of the ZOMBIE GAMBLERS break into cruel and hungry
grins as they advance toward Lemarchand

EXT THE CHATEAU DU REVE NIGHT

Genevieve moving through the gardens in the moonlit darkness
is pressing her way through a thicket

We are CLOSE on her face on her hands on her foot

as a HAND suddenly shoots from the undergrowth and grabs
her ankle

Genevieve SCREAMS and jerks herself free running furiously up
the path towards the front door

Behind her dragging himself from the undergrowth we see De
L’ Isle badly cut and bruised

At the front door Genevieve pounds on it and gets no
response Trying the handle she finds it’s unlocked and lets

herself in

INT CHATEAU DU REVE HALLWAY NIGHT (CONT )

Genevieve pauses in the unlit hallway unsure of where to go
She sees a faint light coming from a room in the distance

INT CHATEAU DU REVE ANTE-ROOM NIGHT

Genevieve creeps into the room still lit by the oil-lamp and
apparently empty except for a bundle of rags on the floor
which suddenly murmurs her name

TORTURED VOICE
Genevieve

With a cry Genevieve moves nearer to the shape on the floor
It is Lemarchand horribly wounded and very close to death

GENEVIEVE
No No Phillip

Genevieve falls to her knees cradling her poor husband’s head
in her arms Panic crosses what’s left of Lemarchand’s face
He presses the Box into her hands

LEMARCHAND
Genevieve Get out Save yourself Save the child

ANGELIQUE
(off)
Child

Suddenly Angelique and the Gamblers are in the room Delvaux
and Corbusier grab Genevieve and drag her to her feet

Despair crosses Lemarchand’s face and he finally dies

GENEVIEVE
Phillip (sobs)

Angelique moves to Genevieve sadistic triumph on her face

GENEVIEVE
What kind of monster are you

ANGELIQUE
The careful kind Phillip Lemarchand can have no child His
bloodline must die with him lest his genius be reborn and
turned against us

GENEVIEVE
No You can’t

ANGELIQUE
Believe me I can

Fingers bent into claws she moves toward Genevieve
Suddenly De L’Isle hurtles into frame seizing Angelique

With the advantage of surprise and momentum he propels both
himself and the Princess into the Pentagram where before any
of the Gamblers can react he shouts out a Latin revocation

DE L’ ISLE
Exeunt Omnia Malefica

All the Gamblers devolve instantly into HUMAN-SHAPED TOWERS OF
WORMS each a mass of pink and brown writhing shapes which
drop to the floor where their wrigglings are overtaken by a
collective transformation into LUMPS OF PRIMAL OOZE

which in turn become PILES OF DRY DUST which seized by
supernatural wind are swept away into nothingness

Simultaneously Angelique SCREAMS and EXPANDS her body
MORPHING impossibly into a huge mass of DEMONIC EYES and
SCREAMING DEMONIC MOUTHS - an even more nightmarish version of
the revelation she gave the gamblers the previous night

There is a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT
And suddenly Genevieve is completely alone in the room

Still holding her husband’s Box and completely freaked out by
all she has seen she turns and flees
EXT CHATEAU DE REVE NIGHT

As Genevieve turns into the street she is startled by the
Derelict He goes into his usual rap

DERELICT
Wonders Madam Spices of the orient Perfumes from far
Cathay

Genevieve looks at him She looks at the Box in her hand She
looks at the Chateau and its memories of evil She hands the

Box to the startled and delighted Derelict and leaves

INT CHATEAU DU REVE ANTE-ROOM IGHT

SERIES OF CLOSE-UPS A hand lights many candles The Pentagram
is sprinkled with salt An ancient-looking book is opened to a
page of Latin manuscript

Latin words are intoned monosyllabically
And there is a burst of light

and Angelique is back within the Pentagram She looks
startled glancing round the room confused

Jacques the apprentice is standing outside the pentagram It
is he who has staged the ritual

JACQUES
Welcome Princess

ANGELIQUE
You You summoned me

JACQUES
And he who summons the magic commands the magic You belong
to me Forever

Angelique’s face falls Have her great ambitions come to this
JACQUES
And I will never make De L’Isle’s mistake Princess Count on

that

He begins to laugh as he draws her from the Pentagram and
strokes her face in proprietory lust

EXT THE ATLANTIC OCEAI DAY

A large wood-built sailing ship heads west

Super-imposed THE CLIPPER “LIBERTE” EN ROUTE TO NEW YORK
INT “LIBERTE” SMALL CABIN DAY

The very pregnant Genevieve sit sin her tiny cabin She is
reading intently in a small leather-bound volume On the cover
are the words Le Journal de Phillip Lemarchand We see the
concentration on her face and the scrawled and detailed
handwriting that fills the volume’s pages

The room contains suitcases trunks one of Lemarchand’s
creations (perhaps the monkey-musician) and a large
document stretched out on the cabin’s tiny table

It’s the cat’s-cradle design We TRACK IN to an EXTREME CLOSE

UP closer and closer until the BLACKNESS of a single ink line
FILLS THE SCREEN

INT BLACKNESSDREAM-SPACE

and suddenly the BLACKNESS is replaced by a RAPID MONTAGE
OF IMAGES

At first the images are familiar - it’s like a fast-forward
through the story we’ve just seen The Box Nightmare Clowns
Zombie Gamblers Angelique’s face etc Then others are added
to the mix -

- a half-glimpsed CENOBITE BEAST terrifying but shadowed

- a GRANDMOTHER (vaguely familiar - like Genevieve at 75)
looking down as if speaking to a child’s POV

GRANDMOTHER
You’ re the one Johnny You’re the one they’ve been waiting
for
- Elevator doors clanging together and a VOID behind them
The images flick back and forth faster and faster achieving
a nightmare crescendo until suddenly the BLACKNESS is back
and we hear a MALE VOICE SCREAMING

INT MERCHANT’S APARTMENT BEDROOM NIGHT

and we TRACK OUT of the SCREAMING MOUTH of JOHN MERCHANT

It’s 4 am and John blinks his nightmare away as his wife
BOBBI clicks on a bedside light to reveal a modern-day
apartment bedroom

BOBBI
Honey You okay Another dream

JOHN
Yeah Another dream Or the same one
Bobbi is an attractive mid-20’s woman John is very
familiar looking In fact apart from the 20 century haircut
he’s a dead ringer for Phillip Lemarchand

Suddenly the sound of more screams Not John this time

JOHN
Oh shit I woke Jack Again

Bobbi’s already out of bed John gets up and follows her
through to

INT MERCHANT’S APARTMENT JACK’S ROOM (CONT )

the bedroom of JACK their seven-year-old who woken and
disturbed by his father’s screams is sitting on his bed

Bobbi and John rush over to him Bobbi comforting him with an
embrace while John looks apologetically distressed

BOBB
There there sweetie It’s okay

JOH
I’m sorry partner Don’t be scared Just Daddy having bad
dreams again

BOBB
And dreams can’t hurt you darling

JOH
They can’t hurt anybody

Bobbi has got Jack back beneath the covers He’s already
sleepy again but he looks up at his father

JACK
Not even you daddy

JOHN
No No not even me

Jack’s eyes close as Bobbi strokes his brow He seems
comforted by his father’s assurance but as Bobbi and John
find each other’s worried eyes we see that they are less sure
than their words imply

EXT CHATEAU DU REVE DAY

The Chateau looks identical to when we last saw it - except
that it now stands in 20th Century surroundings

DISSOLVE TO

INT CHATEAU DU REVE ANTE-ROOM DAY

The ante-room is now decorated as a modern-day living room
Jacques and Angelique are there Angelique unchanged by the
centuries is as beautiful as ever

Jacques too looks the same but there is a terrible corrupt
decadence in his eyes He is sitting at a table messily
finishing a greasy meal Angelique watches in disgust

ANGELIQUE
Do you know what I loathe about you most

JACQUES
(between mouthfuls)
“Do you know what I loathe about you most master”

ANGELIQUE
Master It’s your lack of ambition Have you sought power
Influence Fame No You

Jacques has a last swallow belches and interrupts

JACQUES
Shut up

Angelique falls silent

JACQUES
Do the dishes

Angelique waves a hand The grease-stained plates and cups are
suddenly sparkling-clean and neatly stacked on the table

JACQUES
(putting a cigarette in his mouth)
Light me

Another wave The cigarette tip glows magically into life
Jacques takes a deep satisfying drag and looks at her

JACQUES

Goo Now get down on your hands and knees and ask me to hurt
you And ask nicely

Angelique’s enraged eyes don’t stop her body from doing as
it’s told Jacques smiles cruelly as he crosses toward her

INT MERCHANT’S APARTMENT DAY

Bobbi and John sit at the breakfast table Bobbi throws a
glance to check Jack is sufficiently engrossed in his toys
over at the far end of the room and then turns to John

BOBBI
You look terrible

JOHN
(smiling)
Love you too

BOBB
I’m worried You should see someone

JOH
You know I’ve had them all my life

BOBB
As often As bad (John shakes his head) It’s your goddam
grandmother

JOH
She was a wonderful woman

BOBB
She was a weird woman All those stories How important your
family is How important you are She put stuff in your mind
John

JOHN
Not all of it There’s stuff there that feels like
memories Impossible memories And they don’t just haunt my
dreams They haunt my work Everything I’ve done

He trails off as if it’s impossible to explain

BOBB
I don’t want you haunted I don’t want you hurt

JOH
It’s not that It’s stress This Award Banquet tonight I hate
shit like that

BOBB
(smiling proudly)
Then you shouldn’t be so good

JOH
I’m not I’m not even sure I deserve the award

BOBB
Right That’s why of all the buildings in the country yours
was voted the best
Bobbi picks up a magazine from the table and throws it to him
JOHN
Hey I didn’t say I wasn’t better than everyone else I just
said I could be better I could’ve made it perfect

CLOSE on John as he picks up the magazine and we CUT TO

INT CHATARU DU REVE ANTE-ROOM DAY

CLOSE on a magazine cover with a photo of John in the
lobby of a building We saw the lobby at the end of Hellraiser
III The massive murals that cover the walls are all based on
the Lament Configuration Cover-copy over the photo reads La
Nouvelle Décor Americain John Merchant et su Chef de
1’Oeuvre

PULL BACK to reveal Angelique holding the magazine She is
staring stunned at John and the lobby Her fingers trace
over the cover

ANGELIQUE
(to herself)
At last A purpose A reason

Her reverie is interrupted by the sound of Jacques’ entrance
She lays the magazine down and looks across at him

ANGELIQUE
I’m restless And you’re bored Why don’t we take a trip

JACQUES
We took a trip India

ANGELIQUE
That was in 1949 I think we should see America

JACQUES
Screw America All they want to talk about is how they won the
war for us

ANGELIQUE
Then I would like your permission to go by myself

JACQUES
No

ANGELIQUE
Short and to the point Is that your final word

JACQUES
Yes

ANGELIQUE
Good

There’s something in how she said that that gets Jacques’
attention He looks at her searchingly

ANGELIQUE
You remember De L’Isles’s mistake The one you said you’d
never make

A smile is blooming on Angelique’s face Jacques’ jaw drops
His eyes flick nervously from side to side
ANGELIQUE
You seem tense In need of relaxation Why not ask me to do
something vile and degrading That usually works

Jacques’ fear grows

JACQUES
Angelique I please
ANGELIQUE
You’re blubbering like a little boy Master (pause) Act your
age

And he does With a snap of her fingers Jacques suddenly
BEGINS TO AGE - a second for every year he has lived Within
moments he is a wrinkled toothless rheumy-eyed old man

JACQUES
No No please It hurts

ANGELIQUE
A summoned demon is yours to command forever Unless you stand
in Hell’s way Hell’s game is afoot in America I’d send you a
post-card but

The process continues Jacques is impossibly ancient - 150
years old 180 200

JACQUES
Aaargh

ANGELIQUE
you won’t be around to read it

For a second the 230-year old Jacques stands staring in
horror at Angelique and then finally collapses crumbling to

the floor like a long-dead corpse

EXT THE BUILDING NIGHT

An office-building framed against the sky A line of Limos
deposits smartly-dressed people beside the forecourt

From OFF the sound of APPLAUSE

TIME-DISSOLVE
INT THE BUILDING LOBBY NIGHT

The lobby - dominated by its magnificent Box-like murals - is
set up for the awards banquet Many dining tables fill the
centre of the space before a raiser platform on which stands a
lectern with a microphone and a computer console

The invited guests are finishing coffee and are applauding as
John approaches the lectern
John looks around at the sea of faces He’s nervous Not a
public man He clears his throat and leans to the mike

JOHN
Erm well thanks

Nervous laugh from John Supportive laughs from the audience

JOHN

I’ve always thought the applause of your peers is the best
kind of applause so I’m particularly touched by your response

and by the award I think that Well when I What I’m

trying to say Ah if I’d been any good with words I

would’ve written books I make things And you’re sitting in
the middle of something I made So I’11 let it do my talking
if that’s okay

John turns to the console on the lectern and keys something
in

Members of the audience look puzzled They glance at each
other They glance at John They glance at the walls of the
lobby A sense of embarassment is growing

replaced by a sense of awe Cued by a very quiet engine-
like noise the audience turns to look at the back wall
Framed high in the centre of an otherwise blank wall is a
large square-shaped Box-like design - which begins to move By
some clever trick of engineering the design within changes
constantly It’s almost like they’re looking at an animated
film image except the design is physically moving

Gasps and cries of delight burst from the audience and a huge
wave of appreciative applause fills the lobby

JOHN
See the building was ready for occupancy before this was
finished

John’s voice fills the hall but people aren’t listening to
him They’re lost in the splendour of his creation

JOHN
I felt kind of fraudulent taking this award because
because

John is blinking losing his train of thought Something’s the
matter We see the lobby from his POV —

- It’s too dazzling too impressive Lights bouncing off the
moving panel glitter and reflect off the metallic surfaces of
the other murals They refract and reflect in an almost
blinding coruscation of light The sounds in the room take on
an ARTIFICIAL ECHO laughter and applause reverberating like
in a bad acid-trip
John stumbles for his words bemused and bedazzled
JOHN

See it’s still not finished not perfect there was
I

John blinking and twitching glances round the room through
his distorted perspective He’s trying to find something to
anchor on something to stop the confusion of sight and sound

ANGLE ON Bobbi and Jack in the audience Bobbi’s looking
concerned at the podium It’s clear John can’t see her

BOBBI
(to Jack)
C’mon honey

She helps Jack to his feet and begins to lead him away

JACK
Aren’t wee waiting for daddy

BOBBI
We’re getting the car sweetheart Daddy wants to leave

ANGLE ON John still confused and disoriented He puts a hand
to his forehead to shield his eyes What’s happening to him

Suddenly his eyes lock on a face in the crowd - a face that
unlike every other in the room is staring directly at him

It’s Angelique

John stares at this beguiling smiling woman in confusion Who
is she Where does he know her from

Angelique’s mysterious knowing stare doesn’t falter Finally
John looks away to mumble into the mike

JOHN
Er so thanks Thanks

He steps off the platform head spinning and walks rapidly
away toward the exit door

EXT THE BUILDING NIGHT

John staggers out onto the deserted forecourt and moves to the
edge of the sidewalk turning his head up to the night to gulp
in some air and get himself steady

Angelique exits through the revolving doors She’s many yards
behind John and unseen by him She spots John and face set in

threatening determination heads rapidly towards him

Suddenly a uniformed VALET-PARKER steps right in her path
VALET
Ma’am -— Do you have your

Angelique’s concentration is broken for a second She stares
angrily at the Valet and pushes him aside

VALET
Hey

Angelique looks back to where John was

only to see him disappearing into the back of a Limo
Snarling in frustration Angelique watches the Limo pull away
TIME-DISSOLVE

INT THE BUILDING LOBBY NIGHT

It’s later The lobby is all but deserted UNIFORMED HELP
stack tables and chairs Three or four STRAGGLING GUESTS hover
near the door ready to leave

One guest SHARPE a 40 year old man glances round the lobby
A figure in the shadows at the far end catches his eye

It’s Angelique She fixes Sharpe’s gaze with a look at once
challenging and inviting

Sharpe looks to right and left Nobody is paying any attention
to either him or this beautiful stranger With a small maybe-
I-just-got-lucky smile he makes his way across the lobby

CROSS-FADE TO

INT SERVICE STAIRWELL NIGHT

Angelique leads Sharpe down a dimly-lit stairwell towards the
basements of the building

SHARPE
At least tell me your name

ANGELIQUE
Do we really need to know each other’s names

SHARPE
A mystery woman eh

ANGELIQUE
Aren’t you excited by mystery

SHARPE
Oh yeah You bet
They’ve reached a door at the bottom of the stairwell Sharpe
reaches for Angelique She pulls away gesturing at the door

ANGELIQUE
In here

SHARPE
(opening the door)

You seem pretty familiar with this place

They walk through the door

INT THE BUILDING BASEMENT - CONT

into the basement of the building

ANGELIQUE
No I’m just following my instincts

SHARPE
Me too

Angelique doesn’t mean quite what he thinks she’s glancing

round like a hound on the scent Unerringly she heads for a
large bare concrete pillar at the corner of the basement She
lays her hand on it barely-concealed excitement on her face

ANGELIQUE
Do you like games

SHARPE
(can’t believe his luck)

You’re a dream

ANGELIQUE
Almost Close your eyes Trust me

Sharpe closes his eyes Angelique presses her hand against the
pillar and PUSHES THROUGH THE SOLID CONCRETE the stone
crumbling into grey dust around her probing hand

ANGLE ON SHARPE eyes still closed

SHARPE
Can I look now

ANGELIQUE
You can look now

Sharpe opens his eyes

Angelique is holding her hand out to him Resting in her palm
is the Box

ANGELIQUE
Time to play another game

INT MERCHANT’S APARTMENT BEDROOM NIGHT

John lies asleep with Bobbi who is propped up looking at him
with a concerned expression

John’s faces twitches slightly and his eyes move in REM
Camera TRACKS into his face and DISSOLVES TO

INT LIVING ROOM MID-1960’S (JOHN’ SDREAM-MEMORY )

A seven-year old boy (JOHN) sits on the floor sketching and
cartooning on myriad pieces of paper

Leaving a group of OTHER ADULTS the Grandmother from the
earlier dream walks over to him She looks at his drawings and
GASPS They are all childish and untutored renditions of Box
designs and Cat’s-Cradle designs

CLOSE on Grandma’s face as from a child’s POV

GRANDMOTHER
You’re the one Johnny The one they’ve been waiting for

Suddenly interrupting the dream like a startling and
subconscious editing device there is a DAZZLING BURTH OF
LIGHT like the dizzying lights of the lobby

When we return it is clearly another time The room is
sombre The CHILD’S POV CAMERA moves through many black-clad
adults to reach

a coffin laid out in the living room as in the European
tradition of family wakes John’s grandmother dead is in it

The POV peers into the coffin at her

7 YEAR OLD JOHN
(off)
Grandma You said you’d tell me You said you’d explain

Again the DAZZLING LIGHTS jolts us - and we SMASH-CUT TO

INT MERCHANT’S APARTMENT BEDROOM NIGHT

John’s eyes jerk open in panic Before he can scream or cry
out Bobbi is there - stroking his brow kissing his face
holding him

BOBBI
Honey I’m here I’m here It’s okay

JOHN
(half-whispered)
Is it
He moves into Bobbi’s safe and comforting embrace but his
words seem to echo in the room

INT THE BUILDING BASEMENT NIGHT

Sharpe is sitting cross-legged on the floor working the Box
with intense concentration

Angelique is behind him rubbing his shoulders in
encouragement

ANGELIQUE
I have such sights to show you Mysteries Wonders

The Box suddenly flies from Sharpe’s hands and he watches in
surprise as it completes its movements

SHARPE
Now

ANGELIQUE
Now

Angelique straightens up and stands back

WHOOOSH The chains fly from the Box and rip into Sharpe’s
flesh as he SCREAMS in agony

The basement is suddenly flooded in supernatural blue light
and a space opens ahead of them a shadowed space seeming to
give onto vast regions beyond

Emerging from the shadows comes PINHEAD the Black Pope of
HELLRAISER I II and III back-lit stately but terrifying

And he’s not alone SOMETHING prowls in the shadows behind
Pinhead pacing back and forth like a caged predator
Something big vicious and hungry We can’t see it clearly
yet (and won’t for another few scenes) but its barely glimpsed
presence is horrifying enough

SHARPE
No No What’s happening

Sharpe wounded and bleeding staggers to his feet the chains
from the Box ripping clear of his flesh Does this mean he’s
going to get away

No Another chain flies from the shadows beyond anchors
itself viciously into Sharpe’s neck yanks him off his feet
and pulls him rapidly into the shadows

His SCREAM mingles with the ROARS of the thing in the
shadows
and then both are cut off abruptly as the space is re-
sealed leaving Pinhead alone with Angelique

For a beat they regard each other Angelique looks both
surprised and disappointed at the sight of Pinhead

ANGELIQUE
Things seem to have changed I was expecting my Clowns

PINHEAD
Hell is more ordered since your time Princess And much less
amusing

His tone carries a hint of disapproval at this figure from
Hell’s past It’s already clear that these two aren’t going to
like each other

ANGELIQUE
I’m in favour of efficiency Demon But I can’t abide
dullness

Pinhead looks around the pretty dull basement space

PINHEAD
Then why are we here

ANGELIQUE
Come with me

CUT TO

INT THE BUILDING LOBBY NIGHT

Angelique and Pinhead are in the deserted lobby Pinhead looks
at the Box-like murals and then focusses on the back wall with
its moving panel

PINHEAD
The Box did this

ANGELIQUE
A man did this - but the Box called him Called to his blood

Pinhead is hardly listening lost in the movements of the
panels as if waiting for something

ANGELIQUE
His ancestor made the Box And would have unmade all of us I
killed him

The panel moves into a new pattern Pinhead stares excited
ANGELIQUE

but failed to kill his offspring Now I fear his genius is
reborn
as for a brief moment BLUE LIGHT crackles over the panel
- and then disappears as the pattern moves on

Pinhead looks at Angelique contemptuously

PINHEAD
You’ve been away too long Princess Fear is for humans

ANGELIQUE
Merchant must die before he proves you wrong

PINHEAD
He’1l die But not yet Imagine that panel frozen in the
position of a moment ago This isn’t a room - it’s a holocaust
waiting to wake itself

Angelique looks round the lobby

ANGELIQUE
A Lament Configuration On this scale

PINHEAD
A vast and permanent gateway to the fields of human flesh

How entirely appropriate

EXT MERCHANT’S DESIGN STUDIO DAY

An old warehouse district yuppified into a design area One of
the buildings house John’s design studio
DISSOLVE TO

INT MERCHANT’S STUDIO DAY (CONT )

A big open-plan loft-space with partitioned offices the
biggest of which is John’s own

Framed drawings designs and photographs cover the walls
showing buildings and spaces John has worked on in the past as
well as projects in development

A thematic motif runs through every piece of work In one way
or another and to a greater or lesser extent each design
shows an influence from either the Lament Configuration or
from Lemarchand’s cat’-cradle design for the Box’ opposite
It’s as if John’s gene-pool were speaking through his
unconscious

Framed on a wall in John’s office is Lemarchand’s design
itself the original document brought to America by Genevieve
John is standing with his back to his door as AN ASSISTANT
shows in a visitor and leaves

JOHN
(turning)
Take a seat I’l1ll be

He stops stunned as he finds himself looking at Angelique
She holds his gaze For a beat it’s almost as if he’s ina
trance-like state His voice is small and confused

JOHN
I I know you

Angelique crosses to him and holds out her hand He shakes it
blinking himself back into something approaching normality

ANGELIQUE
You’ve no idea what a pleasure it is to meet you Again

JOHN
You were there Last night

Angelique walks around the office looking at the designs

ANGELIQUE
Oh yes This is all very good You’re the one we’ve been
waiting for

John reacts to this echo of the phrase we’ve heard his
Grandmother say in dreams

JOHN
Who are you

ANGELIQUE
A friend I hope A client I’m sure

John stares at her as she reaches the framed cat’ s-cradle
design For an all-but-subliminal FLASH she looks different -
her hair and makeup more like her 18 Century self

Angelique takes a quick breath at the sight of the design as
if there’s something disturbing or dangerous about it

ANGELIQUE
This is yours

JOHN
No It’s been in the family for centuries I’m working on
something based on it I

ANGELIQUE
May I see it
JOHN
Nobody’s seen it

ANGELIQUE
Then let me be the first It’1ll be our secret

John - under the same kind of hypnotic sway his ancestor once
was with this women - clicks on the computer on his desk and a
3-D SIMULATION comes onto the monitor

It looks like an art-installation in a gallery space The six
faces of the Box are set at various angles

JOHN
Something I wanted to do with mirrors and lasers

Angelique stares fascinated at the screen

John stares fascinated at Angelique Again a FLASH or a
BLURRING of this reality and the past Very brief

On the screen BEAMS OF LIGHT suddenly burst from the six
faces echoing the lines drawn from the faces in the original
design The beams meet merge and reflect in the centre of the
simulated space coalescing into a beautiful LIGHT-SCULPTURE -
which is a luminous 3-D echo of the cat’s cradle

The beams from the six faces blink off leaving the
luminescent cat’s cradle hovering in the middle of the
simulated room

Angelique stares at it fascinated and horrified

JOHN
See in theory it’s possible Perpetual light Trapped light
feeding off its own reflections

He clicks the monitor off

JOHN
But I could never make it work I’d get a few seconds then
it’d blink out

Angelique visibly relieved at the disappearance of the image
walks away from the desk into the room

ANGELIQUE
Sometimes a few seconds are more than enough toymaker

JOHN
What did you call me Who are you

ANGELIQUE
You think you don’t remember But your blood knows Let it
remind you
And suddenly the image in front of John TRANSFORMS Angelique
remains precisely where she is but she is dressed in the style
of the 18 century and the room around her is not John’s
office but the ante-chamber of the Chateau Du Reve

John blinks and the image dissolves back to the present
JOHN
(almost unconsciously)

Angelique

Angelique gives a delighted laugh She smiles beguilingly

ANGELIQUE
You know me from dreams John Merchant John Lemarchand We
have a history together We have a destiny together

Angelique’s manner is as hypnotically seductive as it was with
Phillip centuries before the room’s lights fading around her
John has to fight a spinning head to answer

JOHN
I don’t believe in destiny

ANGELIQUE
You think your work on the building was an accident It called
to you John

She crosses the room to him her beautiful eyes never leaving
his face She strokes his cheek

ANGELIQUE
We have great work to do I shall be in touch

She turns and leaves John staring after her incredulous and
fascinated

EXT THE BUILDING EVENING

The building framed against a twilight sky

INT THE BUILDING TOP-FLOOR CORRIDOR EVENING

An elevator door at the far end opens and VALERIE DYSON a
uniformed Security Officer exits and walks up the corridor
She’s about 40 and is speaking into a cell-phone

VALERIE
I know honey Homework’s always sucked And I am helping
See you do the work and get the grades And I walk round
empty buildings and get the money And between us we send
you to college You get it It’s teamwork

To the CRACKLE of a replying child on the cell-phone Valerie
reaches a door to an office suite
VALERIE
Yeah Yeah Yeah Listen honey I’ve gotta check on
something I’1l see you later okay I love you

She holsters the cell-phone and goes in

INT THE BUILDING OFFICE-SUITE EVENING (CONT )

Valerie looks around the large room puzzled It’s strangely-
lit - a single pool of light near the front dissolving into
shadows beyond She exhales - and her breath is visible in the
unnaturally chilly air A single table is in the room On it
is the Box

VALERIE
Hello

From the shadows Angelique emerges into the little light
Valerie is instantly alert and on-guard

VALERIE
Ma’am - the building is closed And this office is vacant

ANGELIQUE
Not any more

VALERIE
You’ve rented it

ANGELIQUE
Arrangements have been made

VALERIE
Well I’ve heard nothing about it I’1l have to

ANGELIQUE
(interrupting)
You’1l have to leave My colleague and I are in conference

Colleague Valerie looks deeper into the room
In the far shadows we suddenly sense another brooding
presence And sounds come faintly - disturbing sounds like

the rattling of chains

Valerie looks back at Angelique at the secret amusement on
her face The atmosphere is increasingly uncomfortable

ANGELIQUE
Perhaps we can deal with this tomorrow

Valerie pauses then nods her head nervously Screw this
She’s got a kid to get through school She doesn’t need any

trouble She backs out of the room

INT HOTEL CORRIDOR EVENING (CONT )

closing the door in front of her She turns and heads down
to the elevator Halfway something makes her look back

She GASPS The area by the office-suite door is suddenly dark
as if blackness is bleeding from the room into the corridor
And then she hears the sound of the door opening

and she’s rushing to the elevator and hitting the button

The elevator doors open and she runs in only then turning to
look back

She SCREAMS The BEAST that prowled in the shadows behind
Pinhead earlier is in the corridor by the office door Semi-
human but four-legged it’s like something the scientists at
Cenobite Central made as a joke from what was left of a man
and what was left of a dog after a particularly nasty car
crash

Valerie jabs frantically at the first-floor button

For a frozen second the Beast - whose eyes are only black pits
and who locates its prey by smell and sound - “stares” down
the corridor at her Then it launches itself Its speed is
terrifying Braying like a hyena its hurtles impossibly
forward defying all laws of gravity running up and down the
walls across the ceiling over the floor

VALERIE
NO NOOOO

At the very last second - just as the bestial face is inches
from the open door its teeth CHATTERING together at
incredible speed (showing a distinct family resemblance to
Pinhead’s old ally The Chatterer though at a horribly
devolved level) - the elevator door slams shut

INT HOTEL ELEVATOR EVENING (CONT )

To the SOUND of the Beast scrabbling against the outer door
the elevator cabin begins to move downward

VALERIE
Oh thank God Thank God

She looks at the floor display above the door The electronic
numerals show the passing floors 7 6 5 4 3 2

Her panicked breathing finally slowing she moves toward the
door as her floor approaches

but the elevator does not stop And the numbers keep
descending 1 0 -1 -2 -3

Her fingers stab repeatedly at the first floor button
VALERIE
Shit C’mon C’mon

The numbers keep descending -4 -5 -6
Her finger reaches forward again

and suddenly the elevator’s speed increases horribly
Valerie is thrown from her feet as the cabin rockets downward

The quiet hum of the lift machinery becomes A SCREECHING HOWL
and the LCD display is a scarlet BLUR of impossible numbers as
the cabin speeds down down down And Valerie scrabbles
at the walls trying impossibly to clamber up them to avoid
the inevitable crash

And then the cabin stops Stops suddenly and jarringly but
without the explosive bone-crushing finality we expected

The howl of the machinery’s over LCD a burn-out And Valerie
is in the centre of the cabin frozen in shock Is it over

Unfortunately not The door starts to GLOW RED-HOT as if
unbelievable furnaces burn somewhere just beyond its fragile
protection

Simultaneously HIDEOUS SOUNDS begin to drift in from outside
- nightmarish sounds of indescribable agony and unspeakable
joy growing in intensity and volume by the second

I think we know where Valerie has landed don’t we

The door PINGS as if to signal its arrival and its imminent
opening Which isn’t something she’s keen to see

VALERIE
Oh God No No

She presses her hands on it in a terrified attempt to stop it

VALERIE
AAAAAHHH

She staggers back SCREAMING in agony and staring at her palms
-— which are HORRIBLY BLISTERED

There’s nothing she can do - except to stare in horror at the
door and wait for it to open

and the floor of the cabin gives way Splitting along the
centre it opens wide in less then a second and she drops

helplessly out of sight into the terrible BLACK VOID below

INT BLACK VOID
ANGLE UPWARDSVALERIE’S POV - Blackness all around and the
sense of dizzyingly fast descent Up above - and fast receding
- is the single square of light which is the elevator cabin
seen through its open floor

VALERIE
smaller and smaller grows this last precious glimpse of
light until suddenly even it is cut off as the floor SLAMS

back into place and all is darkness and terror

INT THE BUILDING OFFICE SUITE EVENING

Angelique and Pinhead stand in the shadows Somewhere beyond
them we hear the impatient prowling of the Beast

PINHEAD
Where is Merchant

ANGELIQUE
All but in my grasp

Pinhead sneers in dismissive impatience

PINHEAD
I’d have what was left of his mouth begging to work for us by
now

ANGELIQUE
Your Hell has forgotten not only chaos and laughter but the
slow delight of temptation

PINHEAD
I’ve harvested more souls than you could dream of and their
suffering is with me always That is a slow delight

Angelique turns angrily and heads for the door Pinhead speaks
back to her

PINHEAD
Your methods are outmoded Angelique Hell is mine Adjust
or

Angelique turns back in the open door and interrupts

ANGELIQUE
I will have Merchant

She exits

INT THE BUILDING TOP-FLOOR CORRIDOR (CONT )

and slams the door behind her She walks away

ANGELIQUE
(to herself)
And I will have Hell My Hell

INT THE BUILDING OFFICE-SUITE EVENING

Pinhead looks at the closed door amused He steps further
forward into the room and stands concentrating

Slowly supernaturally the space around him changes in
nature The light alters the shadows shift The room feels
like A CHAMBER OF HELL a place whose shadows seem to give on
to unseen vistas from where terrible SOUNDS emanate

The Beast prowls the perimeters of the room Other CENOBITES
are halfOglimpsed in the blue shadows

Like a general adressing his troops or the Pope bringing his
Cardinals up to speed Pinhead addresses them

PINHEAD

I grow impatient with the Princess Human acquiescence is
obtained as easily by terror as by temptation

INT THE BUILDING LOBBY EVENING

Angelique walks through the deserted lobby She pauses in the
centre and looks up at the back wall’s moving panel

Then her eyes flick from corner to corner of the room from
face to face of the huge Box-like murals and back to the

centre of the room as if judging angles judging distances

We see her mind work She’s seeing something here something
that Pinhead knows nothing about

INT MERCHANT’S APARTMENT BEDROOM NIGHT

free-floating against a dream-like one-coloured background

sexually aggressive his hands twisted tight in her hair

Angelique’s voice ECHOES over and over

- The camera PANS from the lovers to find an 18™ century
AUTOMATON (like those Lemarchand made) A beautiful woman who
courtseys and bows her head As she lifts it again the face
is suddenly TERRIFYING and DEMONIC

A jarring startling RINGING SOUND

INT MERCHANT’S APARTMENT BEDROOM DAWN

The ringing is the bedside phone

John blinks awake in shock and grabs at the phone as Bobbi
peers at him from sleepy eyes

BOBBI
What time is it Who the hell is that

JOHN
(into phone)
Hello

ANGELIQUE
(on phone)
Good morning toymaker

John spins half-out of bed to sit on the side pressing the
phone tight to his ear

Bobbi left back on her side of the bed and excluded from the
call stares at John’s back troubled

We can now only hear John’s half of the conversation which
gives nothing away

JOHN

(ad-lib)
Yeah Uh-huh OK etc

John replaces the phone and turns back to Bobbi’s curious
eyes

JOHN
A client He’s Japanese No sense of time Business business
He reaches over and strokes Bobbi’s brow

JOHN
Go back to sleep It’s early

Each lies on their side away from each other And each keeps
their eyes open - Bobbi’s worried John’s guilty troubled

nearby and turns It’s Angelique They smile in greeting

I don’t know why I’m here

ANGELIQUE
Yes you do

Her eyes lock on his Her gaze is challenging and inviting

John stares at her lost in her beauty her sexuality her
blatant availability

ANGELIQUE

John reacts to this echo from his erotic dream She smiles

ANGELIQUE

JOHN

She takes his arm and leads him further into the gallery

INT MERCHANT’S APARTMENT DAY

Bobbi supporting an over-filled laundry basket is at the
apartment door talking to Jack who is on the floor working on
a model kit with profound seriousness

BOBBI

Shh mom I’m concentrating

Bobbi grins and maneuvers herself out of the apartment

INT LAUNDRY CORRIDOR DAY

A NEON LIGHT FLICKERS on the ceiling Another’s dead There’s
an opressive silence as Bobbi walks towards the laundry-room

A SHARP NOISE She spins round The detergent on top of the
clothes topples She grabs it There’s nothing behind her

But an atmosphere of foreboding remains as she reaches the
Laundry room She casts another glance down the corridor as

she goes in Nothing just the flicker and the silence

INT LAUNDRY ROOM DAY (CONT )

The Laundry-room —- a bank of washing machine a table couple
of plastic chairs and a bank of dryers - is empty But as
Bobbi goes through the routine - opening two washers loading
them counting her quarters sprinkling the powder - the
creepy atmosphere that we felt in the corridor continues

Suddenly - THWAP THWAP THWAP - a terrible beating sound
fills the air Bobbie jumps and cries out What is it

Through the window we see a PIGEON The sound is merely its
wings beating against the glass It flies off

Bobbi sighs and continues But the edgy atmosphere remains We
feel as if there’s a presence on the edges of our senses
something watching and waiting Something malign

Perhaps it’s the shadows in the room Do they move at the
corner of our vision The feeling persists A sense of
imminence Something is going to happen Something bad

Bobbi hits the start button and straightens up She glances
round the room again Nothing She’s being silly And then she
glances upwards as if thinking Suddenly she’s certain

and hurtles up the one flight to their apartment floor

SOUNDS SWELL on the soundtrack —- a BANGING like an angry fist
on an apartment wall and a MUFFLED VOICE raised in anger

And something else A LOW HELLISH RUMBLING on the very edge of
perception —- like a distant echo of unimaginable machines
indescribably vast and inexpressibly malicious

Bobbi heaves open the door to their corridor runs out

Pulsing SHAFTS OF BLUE LIGHT are visible beneath and behind

heads for the other room

Only to stop as Jack walks out into the doorway Bobbi doesn’t
take time to notice the strange stunned look on his face

BOBBI

JACK
I can’t mommy He won’t let me

One of Jack’s arms is stretched out back into the room and as
Bobbi moves forward and the angle changes we see why

Pinhead is holding the boy’s hand
Bobbi SCREAMS as the demon smiles cruelly at her

BOBBI
Get your hands off him

endless hungers he could learn

Bobbi rushes forward Pinhead jabs a forbidding finger

INT ART GALLERY DAY

Angelique and John walk into a partitioned space in the
gallery It houses some large video-installation and apart
from the light from the bank of monitors is dark

There is a single viewing bench Nobody is in there
Angelique pauses and looks up at John She’s waiting
JOHN
(trying to stay rational)
I’ve dreamed of you Not just last night For years But

But when I wake up it’s Bobbi who’s there Bobbi

Angelique says nothing does nothing She’s still waiting
John blinks as if fighting a powerful spell With each blink
a FLASH IMAGE - The Box The Cat’s-Cradle Grandma Bobbi

But it’s no good The spell is too strong He leans down
And they kiss Their arms wrap around each other slowly and
they press their bodies together in a passionate embrace

Still kissing they sink onto the bench Their hands roam each
other’s bodies John lowers his head kissing her neck and
shoulders She puts her hands to the back of his head pushing
him lower He kisses her breast wildly Encouraged by her
moans he slips his hand beneath her skirt

Angelique’s head is thrown back in pleasure It’s clear that
this is not just Hellish seduction She’s getting off on it
too Her eyes half-close her mouth half-opens

and something else begins to happen Her guard down her
blood inflamed her passion pulsing she begins unknowingly to
slip her mask of humanity It’s subtle at first a strange de-
focused effect that blurs her features as her face begins to
twitch in more than passion

Carried away by John’s intimate caresses she is moving into a
pre-orgasmic state her breathing heavy and animal-like John
raises his head his hand still lost between her legs

and GASPS in shock as he looks at her face
Angelique’s eyes are SOLID MASSES IF GLISTENING BLACKNESS

JOHN
My God

He leaps to his feet in shock and fear backing away

Angelique ecstasy turned to frustration and rage throws back
her head and roars Her mouth is FANGED and DEMONIC

Realising what she looks like Angelique waves an arm at the
bank of monitors and they BLOW OUT en masse plunging the room
into shadowed darkness

John turns and runs fleeing the partitioned space as
Angelique’s transformation climaxes in the darkness giving us

a shadowed sense of her terrible appearance

John flees through the rest of the gallery - stared at
strangely by the other CUSTOMERS

Bobbi and Jack crouch on the floor of the office their
breaths visible in the supernaturally cold air Bobbi hugs
Jack protectively in the pool of light while in the
threatening shadows beyond we hear the padding and the
prowling of the half-seen circling Beast which guards them

The Box still sits on the table Jack points at it

JACK
Look Mommy Like Daddy’s drawings

Bobbi stares at the Box Jack’s right She reaches out and
picks it up

In the background the Beast raises its blind head What’s
happening

Bobbi runs her hand over the Box like so many before her and
like so many before her her fingers almost instinctively find
the appropriate movements Her thumb strokes the central
circle-motif and there is the TINIEST FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT

and the Beast steps menacingly forward SNARLING

down a nightmarish gauntlet a creepy cold shadowed walkway
in which chains and hooks hang and rattle The floor is wet
and mildewed the doors warped and slimy At the far end
beckoning BLUE LIGHT pulses from the door of the office-suite

Horrible LOW SOUNDS fill the air like the laboured breathing
of some vast asthmatic creature as John begins to make his
way cautious way down

As his feet pass a door BLOOD oozes in rich quantities from
beneath it

A TERRIBLE CACKLING LAUGH From nowhere From everywhere

A chain shivers and twists spinning to reveal a BABY’S LIVER
skewered on a hook

CLOSE on John’s feet - as a SLITHERING BLACK EEL writhes over
them to disappear into the shadows

In a web on a wall A PREGNANT SPIDER bursts into labour and
SCORES OF TINY SPIDERS spill from her body rushing
everywhere
John moves resolutely on despite all these scares drawing
nearer to the office-suite and the near-blinding BLUE LIGHT

He reaches the door

shadows also He smiles at John

and dreams A whole imagined future where you love him and
watch him grow

will not die here for a thousand years his dearest wish will
be that he had

snatches up the Box

just as the Beast comes smashing through the door to land
on the table and rush down its length toward her

Still terrifying still powerful it waits hesitant

and the Beast baring its teeth in a blood-curdling HOWL
leaps forward hurtling through the air in attack-mode

over to the elevator

A look of dread comes over him as he sees the elevator door
banging constantly against the side of its doorjamb as if it

John runs to it and it suddenly flies open with a
terrifyingly LOUD NOISE

John jumps in shock but moves further and looks in
and down There is no cabin there just a dizzying drop

into blackness Incredibly distant but disturbing SOUNDS
echo up the shaft Sounds of flame machinery and agony

He hears a sound behind him and turns - to see Jack

and Angelique back in human form her hands resting on
Jack’s young shoulders Her eyes are no longer seductive as

they stare at John but cold and angry Then she looks down at

John looks rapidly from her to the walls to the corners to
the reflective points on the surfaces and then keys an entry
into the console His finger hovers over the “enter” key He
looks at her Why should he do what she wants She raises a
hand toward Jack’s neck in threat

ANGELIQUE
Do it

John hits the key

LIGHT-BEAMS shoot out from points in the wall faces jetting
in toward the centre of the lobby
A sudden wave of suspicion washes over Pinhead’s face
The BEAMS meet EXPLODING into a DAZZLING CORUSCATION

Angelique stepping well back to near the lectern and away
from what’s happening grins in double-cross victory

Pinhead ROARS in anger and fear Suddenly he tips his head
way back - and a CHAIN flies from out of his mouth jetting up
straight toward the ceiling

The hooked chain anchors itself into the ceiling - and PINHEAD
flies upward along it at incredible speed like a spider
sucking itself back up a web-strand

ANGELIQUE
NOOOO

Pinhead fastened supernaturally to the ceiling like a
humanoid insect looks down

as the LIGHT-SCULPTURE from John’s simulation of
Lemarchand’s cat’s-cradle bursts into being far below him

Pinhead snarling in angry revenge shoots his head in various
directions as if summoning supernatural aid

and a MULTITUDE OF CHAINS suddenly fly from low angles and
wrap themselves around Angelique pirouetting rapidly up her
body to cocoon her

Simultaneously as in the simulation the original beams go
off and the light-sculpture is left free-floating

Jack - almost literally squeezed from Angelique’s grasp as the
chains fly upwards - is sent tumbling towards his father who
grabs him protectively as

Angelique is suddenly yanked off her feet and pilled
inexorably toward the centre of the room and the luminescent
cat’ s-cradle

From Pinhead’s POV Angelique disappears beneath the light

ANGELIQUE
It burns It burns

John hugs Jack tightly to him
JOHN
(to himself)

A few seconds is the best I ever got

And as if on cue the cat’s-cradle winks out of existence
From this angle we see that Angelique hadn’t quite reached it
and is lying still on the floor wrapped in the chains

Pinhead lowers himself rapidly down and stalks toward John As
he passes Angelique she raises her head and laughs
hysterically as if driven made by her proximity to
destruction

PINHEAD
(to John)
You’re as dangerous as she said you were No more games

Pinhead flicks his head toward little Jack - and a hooked
chain comes flying at the boy

John launches himself forward shoving Jack aside

JOHN
Run Jack Run

and taking his place as the chain snaps viciously through
the air

and slams right through John’s throat killing him
instantly

Jack is running across the lobby

ANGELIQUE
The bloodline Kill it

Pinhead swings round getting Jack in his eye-line

and Jack is suddenly grasped by an arm and pulled tight to
a cradling body

It’s Bobbi - and she’s got the Box in her hand Straightening
up and shielding Jack she holds the Box forward moving it

BOBBI
Go play with your dog you bastard

The Box flies from her hand spinning and turning through its
positions and hits the floor

PINHEAD
No

The Box clicks into place

and Pinhead and Angelique are SUCKED into it screaming
their frustrated rage

Bobbi pulls Jack tight to her and crouches down
as the whole lobby begins to SHAKE and SHUDDER EXPLOSIONS
of LIGHT and SOUND fill the frame as Hell reclaims everything
of its own The Box is still open - and it’s pulling the walls
and murals into itself

Suddenly - with a final explosive WHITE-OUT - all is silent
and still and Bobbi and Jack are alone in the denuded and
devastated lobby with the closed Box

and CLOSER until Jack’s eye fills the frame and we fall into
the BLACKNESS of his pupil in ECU

INT PAUL’S CABINHOLDING PEN ANNEXE MINOS

We’re in a room decorated in 18 century style and full of 18™
century objects - including one of Lemarchand’s automata

As the camera explores the room A TV broadcast plays in the
BACKGROUND showing news footage of a MASSIVE FIRE

TV ANNOUNCER (VO)

Fires burn unchecked in the forests of Luna One tonight
roaring wildly beneath the great meta-glass canopies of the
Pan-Pacific colony Economic cutbacks that did away with the

Suits-for-Settlers program are now being blamed for the
colony’s inability to simply turn off the air and thus douse

the fire Angry voices are being raised in Tokyo -
particularly because Colonists could be transported to the
Minos space station if that trillion-dollar facility was not a
year behind schedule and according to unconfirmed sources
not only out of radio-contact but also out of its geo-
stationary orbit (etc etc)

At this point the TV clicks off and the camera finds DR PAUL
MERCHANT sitting in a Rocco-style chair

Paul is identical to Phillip and John except for a mole on his
cheek and his hair-colour His face is haunted and obsessive
The single-minded genius of his ancestors has reached a
neurotic fruition in him

Behind him we see on a wall the 2204 ad equivalent of a cork-
board - a screen on which IMAGES replay in rotational display
The images are all familiar to us and all connected with the
bloodline’s history The Box the Cat’s-cradle design family
portraits (photos of John oils of Phillip etc) sketches of
demons (Pinhead and Angelique) The Building etc etc

Paul is addressing an unseen listener

PAUL

important It’s unclear what effect on the space-time
continuum such a surge of metaphysical energy will have

He hits a key on his console and the first Paul BLINKS OUT of

Paul stands and crosses the room and we CHANGE ANGLRE to
see

that the other end of the room is very different The
first part we saw was Paul’s living quarters This part looks
like a control booth or a mixing bay On a desk are three 23°
century MONITORS and a pair of latex gloves each fingertip
connected by micro-filaments to a console beneath one of the
monitors

Below the desk and the monitors is a STAIRCASE leading down to
a separate structure - a large and massively solid HOLDING

mechanism

the walls massively thick and very tall It is some kind of
holding pen for something very dangerous Currently it’s
empty except for a shadowed figure cross-legged in a corner

There’s something familiar about this image It’s a posture we
recognise It reminds us of Elliot Spenser in HELLBOUND

It is a simple SERVO-ROBOT - a steel skeleton with fully
articulated limbs Its hands are close together in front of

its chest And it’s holding the Lament Configuration

Watching both the 3-D graphic and the image from within the

holding anything but the movements of his hands look familiar

The skeletal steel hands of the robot begin to move With
remote-controlled precision its metal fingers play over the
Box finding its secrets discovering its hidden alignments
moving it closer and closer towards its final configuration

and the Box jumps from the robot’s grip to land on the
floor in front of it where it makes its own final adjustment

A beat of silence and stillness

laser-blasted look to them There are grooves in the walls of

All of them look round at the laser-hewn space

CARDUCCI
How the hell do they do this

CHAMBERLAIN
It’s pretty straightforward Tractor-beams capture a suitably-
small asteroid and then Meta-Lasers form the structures from
the rock itself It’s actually cheaper than building from
scratch

Cheaper until some crazy SOB takes it on an unscheduled trip

react it slams into Parker - SLICING HIS FACE OFF

and Angelique suddenly pulls them both backwards She
slips from his arms but keeps tight hold of one of his hands
and steps back through the mirror emerging on the other side
as her Cenobite self

hold of his hand he too can pass magically through as if the

mirror were liquid

Unfortunately she lets go
And Carducci is suddenly SCREAMING IN AGONY The mirror is

presses her body back into shadow while leaning her head just
enough to see through the cross-hatched metal of the grill
ROSCOE’ S POV DOWN THROUGH GRILL Nothing Nothing Nothing
and then Pinhead walks into view

Roscoe holds her breath

Pinhead keeps walking Not looking up He’s nearly past the
grill And then he stops

Pinhead’s head tilts up a little as if sensing something
and the he moves on out of view
Roscoe breathes gain
ROSCOE
(mouthing it)
Alright
She waits a second to be sure and turns in the air-duct

to see the Chatter-Beast twenty yards from her

ROSCOE
Oh fuck

She doesn’t even have time to bring her rifle round in the
cramped space The Beast comes rushing along the duct In two
seconds it’s there its awful mouth opening wide

CUT TO

INT LOCK-UP MINOS

Corinne is over with Edwards Paul is still in the cell

EDWARDS
Give me a break

CORINNE
I’m completely serious He has to be let out He’s the only
chance we have I’ve seen them

Edwards stares at her The seriousness of her tone almost
holds his disbelief at bay Then rationalism reasserts itself

EDWARDS
Let him out I should put you in there with him People might
be dying out there

CORINNE
That wouldn’t have happened if the government had left him
alone

EDWARDS
Well excuse me Obviously it’s our fault
Corinne sighs Enough argument

CORINNE
We’re letting him out

EDWARDS
We’re not doing anything I’m the administrator andl

Corinne half-turns as if she can’t listen anymore - and then
swings back and DECKS Edwards with a powerful right hook

CORINNE
Former administrator I’m your successor

She moves to the desk and hits some buttons The barred door
of Paul’s cell flies open Paul rushes over to her as Edwards
rises groggily to his feet
PAUL
I don’t know how far things have gone You’1ll have to help me
(looks to Edwards) Both of you
TIME-CUT TO

INT CORRIDOR MINOS

Paul Corinne and Edwards run along a corridor They reach a
three-way crossroads and stop

PAUL
You both know what to do You both know where to go

EDWARDS
This is insane

PAUL
Yes it is Accept that if you want to come trough this You
seem to be a man of reason Don’t be

Shaking his head Edwards nevertheless takes off down one of
the corridors Paul turns to Corinne

PAUL
You’ve been brave Stay brave Stay alive

Corinne looks as if she wants to say something She just nods
and turns to go

PAUL
Corinne

CORINNE
Yes

PAUL
My My life was planned from the moment I was born From
before I was born I had no time for anything but the destiny
I was given (cont)

He pauses looks deep in her eyes

PAUL
(cont) I wish my life could’ve been different

A beat They reach out and touch each other’s hand briefly
And then they’re away down different corridors

INT LOW-LEVEL CORRIDOR MINOS

The Cenobites Pinhead leading move along in implacable
rhythym while the Dog-Beast scurries and slides weaving
around and about the others

As the monsters pass the space behind them DARKENS as if they
are dragging endless night in their wake

INT FLIGHT-DECK MINOS

Paul rushes in to the flight-deck and runs over to the master
console His expert fingers fly over various keys and buttons
Monitors show the exterior images of the satellites - three of
which still flash the LOCKED signal He looks at the others
anxiously

INT CORRIDOR CROSSROADS MINOS

A set of double-doors is smashed open from the other side and
Pinhead stalks into an area where two corridors meet His
monstrous troop flows in behind him As before BLACKNESS
follows them all light vanishing as they pass

ANGELIQUE
If Merchant is finally playing again the stakes must be high

PINHEAD
His gamble is trusting other players

Pinhead looks down as the Chatter-Beast He points an
imperious arm down one of the corridors

PINHEAD
Fetch

The Beast takes off at incredible speed Angelique and the
Siamese-Twin go after it Pinhead goes the other way

INT FLIGHT-DECK MINOS

Paul holds a slim black object in his hand Some kind of
remote-control He points it at various console-switches and
it glows red as if reading information from each one
He looks overhead Two angle-poises point down to where he’s
standing behind the console He hits a button and they both
shine a combining light on him

He looks back at the monitors All the satellites are not yet
locked He looks into the room as if awaiting the inevitable

arrival of his enemy

INT HOLDING PEN ANNEXE MINOS

Edwards walks into the annexe He stares in shock at the
blasted reinforced-door and the bloodstains and bones that are
all that remains of Rimmer and walks through

INT HOLDING PEN MINOS

into the Pen Suppressing a shudder at the CORPSE of
Parker he scans the area

and sees the Box He picks it up turns to leave
and sees Angelique in the blasted doorway

EDWARDS
Oh no

Angelique walks into the Pen - and the Siamese-Twin follows
Edwards looks from them down to the Box in his hand

EDWARDS
He he told me what to do

Angelique’s face creases in contemplation as she looks at the
man She thinks she’s got his number

ANGELIQUE
Please Go ahead If you think it will do any good

Edwards runs his fingers listlessly over the Box He presses
at it a few times as if looking for hidden buttons Nothing

His arms drop hopelessly and he starts to sob

EDWARDS
It’s a box It’s just a box

He lifts it and flings it half-heartedly at Angelique
Her hand rises and catches it expertly

ANGELIQUE
Thank God for men of reason (to the Siamese-Twin) Finish it

She turns and walks away not even watching as Edwards falls
to his knees sobbing in fear
The Siamese-Twin towers over him and SPLITS

TWIN 1TWIN 2
I cannot bear to be apart from my brother

CUT TO

INT FLIGHT-DECK MINOS

The only sounds in the flight-deck are the hum of the
mechanisms and the sound of Paul’s tense breathing

And then there’s another sound
The sound of demonic feet approaching

Paul looks up from the console Angelique has entered holding
the Box Their eyes lock each recognising and acknowledging
their bizarre history

ANGELIQUE
Building bigger toys than ever

PAUL
The Minos is no toy It’s

ANGELIQUE
I know what it is Don’t use it I saw your room The past
means as much to you as it means to me We can reclaim it
Together

Paul looks at her For a second the same magic that worked on
John works on him and he has a FLASH-IMAGE of her human self
in 18 century costume Beautiful Alluring

He blinks it away His face sets grimly

PAUL
Not this time Princess

Disappointed rage crosses her face Before she can answer
they are no longer alone Pinhead and the Siamese-Twin have
entered

The DARKNESS comes with Pinhead and then changes into BLUE
LIGHT diffusing in from various angles as if the doors to Hell
are open Simultaneously HOWLING WINDS begin to roar through
the room necessitating raised voices

Pinhead looks at Paul standing behind the console in the light
from the two overhead angle-poises

PINHEAD
How the centuries pass I’ve thought often down those long
days of the pleasures we have prepared for you
PAUL
Pleasures

PINHEAD
In a manner of speaking Your ancestors have been there before
you The Labyrinth still rings with the echoes of their agony
- Lullabyes for the Children of the Worm

Paul looks at the monitors Two more satellites are showing
the LOCKED signal

CUT TO

INT SATELLITE-CONTOL MINOS

Corinne feverishly types in co-ordinates and watches the
monitors click one by one into the LOCKED position

Finally the words ALL SATELLITES ALIGNED show on the master-
monitor

Corinne sits back and lets out a long slow sigh
CORINNE
Alright girl You passed the science exam Now let’s see how
you do at track

She exits the room

INT CORRIDOR MINOS (CONT )

and out into a corridor And starts running Fast

INT FLIGHT-DECK MINOS

Paul’s eyes register the ALL SATELLITES ALIGNED signal He
shows no relief or excitement Good poker player

PAUL
It’s over now It ends with me

PINHEAD
I think not Your bloodline may end but the game goes on
forever Four hundred years your family has played A long
time No The blink of a suppurating eye to He Who Dwells In
The Deep

PAUL
The game may go on forever but you won’t be there to play it

ANGELIQUE
Fly us back to your world toymaker No end of games there

PAUL
I’m afraid I can’t do that
ANGELIQUE
Want to play here Well you won’t be playing with this

She holds out the Box Pinhead smiles Paul doesn’t

PINHEAD
Good The woman

ANGELIQUE
A gift to our chattering friend You know how fond he is of

female meat

INT CORRIDOR MINOS

Corinne reaches a T-junction She turns left into

INT LONG CORRIDOR MINOS (CONT )

the longest corridor we’ve seen yet It stretches at least
a hundred yards on either side of the T-junction

Just before renewing her run Corinne looks down the other
stretch A hundred yards of emptiness

But not for long Appearing suddenly at the far end comes the
Dog-Beast careering towards her down the corridor

CORINNE
Oh my God

Corinne wastes a precious second staring at it her jaw open
in horrified shock Then she turns and runs for her life

And the Dog-beast runs for it too
It’s nightmare-fast seeming to gain thirty yards for every
ten that Corinne covers Within a few seconds of the chase

stating it’s almost halved the distance between them

Not wanting to - and hardly able to afford to - Corinne
nevertheless can’t resist looking back over her shoulder

She registers how as the creature passes the walls behind it
become a nightmare of darkness and despair

CORINNE
(to herself)
Run Run

And she does Panting sweating heart pounding she runs

The demon pursues her vigorously and tirelessly gaining yard
by yard as it speeds furiously down the corridor
Gasping with exertion Corrinne stares desperately ahead of
her at the door she’s heading to It seems closer

CORRINNE
Come on Come on

She redoubles her effort
and suddenly she trips cartwheeling to the floor

As if sensing her sudden weakness the monster behind her
HOWLS in infernal delight and streaks forward even faster

Corrinne scrambles to her feet runs on and suddenly she’s
there She bursts through the door

INT ENTRY BAYESCAPE VEHICLE PAD MINOS (CONT )

and tumbles into the entry bay

Immediately ahead of her a small single-person egg-shaped
ESCAPE POD sits on a pad beyond the open station-side door of
an airlock

Corinne rushes to the pod slams her hand on the release catch
of the door ad clambers in

INSIDE POD -

It ain’t built for luxury There’s a contoured body panel into
which Corinne stands a control panel in front of her a round
window and that’s it On the control panel is a sticker marked
AIRLOCK REMOTE and beneath it two toggle switches one marked

INTERNAL which is clicked to the OPEN position and one marked

EXTERNAL which is clicked to CLOSED

Corinne flicks the INTERNAL to CLOSED

IN THE ENTRY BAY —-

The airlock behind the pod begins to close

But simultaneously the doors to the bay burst open and the
Dog-Beast leaps into the room

INSIDE POD -

Corinne looks at the slowly-closing airlock door and at the
far from slow Monster rushing toward her

CORINNE
No No

The door’s not going to close in time She’s fucked She
groans and then thinks of something
She slams forward the switch that says BRAKE and then hits the
one that says IGNITION

IN THE ENTRY BAY -
A massive THRUST OF JET-PROPELLED FLAME slams out of the back
of the stationary pod blasting the Beast back across the

room

The jet-flame is cut in time to allow the airlock door to
close without being melted

IN THE AIRLOCK -
The outer airlock door slides open
The ignition starts again

EXT MINOS DEEP SPACE (CONT )

A beat of stillness

and then the egg-shaped Pod comes spinning wildly toward
camera Corinne is safe

NT FLIGHT-DECK MINOS

Paul isn’t CLOSE on his face stiff with tension

PULL BACK to reveal why —

The viciously-barbed tips of several of Hell’s Hooked Chains
are hovering inches from his face and body taut and swaying
like steel King Cobras waiting to strike

A cruel smile illuminates Pinhead’s face as he stares at Paul
Paul looks at another monitor providing entry-bay date The

words POD-LAUNCH are flashing He signs in relief - and then
looks up at Pinhead and Angelique

PAUL
It didn’t get her She’s free She’s safe

PINHEAD
Let’s see how much of a comfort that is to you when the

maggots are eating your eyes From the inside

Paul’s eyes suddenly become fixed and cold Like gunfighters
in a spaghetti western Paul and Pinhead stare at each other

PAUL
Let’s play

His fingers dive at the buttons
but Pinhead’s so much faster - and the hooked chains jet
forward viciously to pierce Paul’s body and face

and Paul just WINKS OUT of existence disappearing down to
a white dot like a turned-off TV Or a cancelled hologram

ANGELIQUE
What

Paul steps out from another part of the room entirely He has
the remote-control in his hand

PAUL
Hologram All done with mirrors Like this

His finger hits a button on the remote and we CUT TO

EXT MINOS DEEP SPACE

The Minos floats against the star-studded blackness
Suddenly VAST BEAMS OF LIGHT burst from all six satellites

Like Lemarchand’s design like John’s miniature version the
beams meet and EXPLODE into a HUGE CORUSCATING CAT’S CRADLE
completely encircling the Minos dwarving even that vast
structure in an awesome and dazzling light-show

INT FLIGHT-DECK MINOS

Pinhead Angelique and the Siamese-twin all stagger as if
suddenly weakened dreadfully The Box falls to the ground from
Angelique’s slackened grasp

PINHEAD
NOOOO

He raises his hands as if to summon chains or other tools
and nothing happens

EXT MINOS DEEP SPACE

The show gets even bigger As if reality can’t cope with the
massive Cat’s-Cradle a HUGE STORM IN SPACE erupts around the
Minos a maelstrom of roiling gases and impossible lightning

The Cat’s-Cradle of light suddenly sends out a LIGHT BEAM into
the space behind it The Beam smashes into a mass of bubbling
gaseous matter WHITES-OUT briefly

and is replaced by an area of intense blackness a corona
og gaseous matter swirling about its edges defining its
position
The nebulous swirl seems to be disappearing constantly into
the unrelieved blackness of the centre It is as if the Cat’s-
Cradle has sundered reality has created an astronomical
anomaly A place where matter disappears

INT FLIGHT-DECK MINOS

Pinhead looks over at Paul horror-struck

PINHEAD
What have you done What is it

PAUL
Endgame demon

Angelique screams

EXT DEEP SPACE

The Minos suddenly judders within the Cat’s-cradle and begins
to hurtle toward its furthest point - the swirling black

reality-warp

INT FLIGHT DECK MINOS

Pinhead ROARS at Paul - and from his open mouth a CHAIN flies
toward Paul

and hooks into his chest Paul grunts in pain But then
grasps the chain yanks it and pulls Pinhead toward him

The two enemies grasp each others arms wrestling and
fighting somehow keeping their balance in the wildly-
careering deck when Angelique and the Siamese-Twin are knocked
helpless to the floor Pinhead and Paul scream to be heard in
the cacophony

PINHEAD
In Hell I’1l teach every one of your nerve-endings to scream
separately

PAUL
You still don’t get it It’s over Finally irrevocably over

EXT DEEP SPACE

The Minos is now careering toward the reality-warp at an
incredibly increased speed

And suddenly within the Cat’s-Cradle and almost within the
irresistible blackness the Minos begins to break apart

unable to withstand the terrible pressures

INT FLIGHT DECK MINOS

A SMASH-CUT to Paul and Pinhead as all around them the deck
disintegrates A frozen second for Paul’s last line

PAUL
Welcome to Oblivion

EXT DEEP SPACE

and the just as it disappears into the gaping maw of the
warp Minos comes apart completely in a massive explosion

THROUGH THE WARPPSYCHEDELIC SPACE (BLUE SCREEN)

The MONTAGE BACKGROUND is a whirling insanity of images
spiralling patterns the birth of planets exploding
supernovae volcanic eruptions the works

Asteroid DEBRIS spins wildly in the foreground piece after
piece being whirled away until finally we see the Box left
alone above the background - the perspectives of which all
sell the idea that it is constantly falling even though its
image size remains constant

Slowly the camera TRACKS IN on the Box until the black circle
that dominates one of its faces FILLS THE SCREEN

And then without quite realising when it changed we realise
we are tracking OUT not in

moving through an EXTREME CLOSE UP of the Box and
continuing on out

INT LEMARCHAND’S WORKROOM NEARLY MIDNIGHT

and we see the Box is resting on the hand of Phillip
Lemarchand in his workshop in 18 century France

The door opens and Genevieve enters in her nightdress

GENEVIEVE
Is it done

LEMARCHAND
Done
