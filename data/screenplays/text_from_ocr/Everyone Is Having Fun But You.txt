INT VENDING MACHINE FACTORY - DAY

The spanning factory floor is filled with vending machines of
various shapes sizes and states of assembly Most are empty
though a few are filled with candy and frozen burritos A few
workers are moving machines around applying decals and putting
on the finishing touches

PHIN SAGE 36 wearing a black-on-white suit brandishes a
smile As he speaks toward the camera He is leading a tour of
the factory Enthusiasm fills his words He is very proud

PHIN
This is where the vending machines go
through final assembly They are
getting dressed up to be sent out into
the world

The camera pulls back to reveal that Phin is talking to an
apathetic class of THIRD GRADERS and their teacher MRS
SULLIVAN

PHIN (CONTD)
Some go to offices some to waiting
rooms and some even go to schools
just like you guys You see these
machines are like my children I send
them out into the world and they bring
back money

MIKEY 8 raises his hand

MIKEY
Mr Sage

PHIN
Just call me Phin

Mikey shakes his head “no” Phin gives him a puzzled look

MIKEY
Moms and dads make the money not the
kids

PHIN

That’s not always true Take welfare
families for example More kids means
more welfare money

Mrs Sullivan flashes Phin a disapproving glare SHELLY 8 and
three-quarters chimes in
SHELLY
Like Travis

We see TRAVIS smiling wearing two different shoes

MRS SULLIVAN
No Shelly Travis’s dad is on
unemployment That’s completely
different

Another student JASON hyperactive 8 raises his hand but
doesn’t wait to be called on before blurting out

JASON
Hey Mr Sage where’s all the candy

PHIN
We don’t actually fill them with candy
until they are setup at a location
These ones are just filled with tasty
snacks for the factory employees

All of the children make disappointed grunts and groans
Shelly’s eye light up She points

SHELLY
Look An Oompa Loompa

Phin turns to see a factory worker HENRY short with a bad tan
and a lot of tattoos Phin suddenly rubs the bridge of his nose
as if he has been struck with a sharp pain in his head He
continues on

PHIN
No That’s just Henry Please be
nice he’s going through a divorce

A stressed-out looking WENDLE 7 spurts out

WENDLE
Is it because his kids are bad

PHIN
What No no

SHELLY
Why did you invent vending machines

PHIN
Well I didn’t actually invent vending
machines but I did revolutionize them
with this refrigerated model

Phin looks over to see Jason on his knees reaching up the mouth
of the vending machine trying to grab a frozen burrito from the
bottom row
PHIN (CONT’D)
Hey Stop that

Jason frowns and slowly pulls his hand out of the machine

PHIN (CONTD)
How would you like it if someone put
their hand up you and took your
burritos

Jason starts to tear up

MRS SULLIVAN
Mr Sage

JASON
(to Mrs Sullivan)
You said this field-trip would be fun

Phin blinks hard a few times trying to focus Something is off

PHIN
Sorry I’m sorry kids My head just
really started killing me It’s okay
He wouldn’t have been able to reach
the burritos anyway

MIKEY
I bet I could Mr Sage

Phin rubs his left eye

PHIN
Sorry but the machines are designed
so you can’t just reach in and grab
things

Ignoring Phin Mikey pulls out a pencil and runs to the machine
He drops to his knees and starts digging around in the machine’s
opening with the pencil

JASON
Hey That’s not fair I get another
try

PHIN

Whoa hey This isn’t a competition

Jason dives back down at the machine’s opening squeezing next
to Mikey shoving both of his tiny arms up toward the burritos
Things are getting out of control with both boys digging around
in the machine The kids are having a blast but Phin starts to
panic

Phin heads toward the kids at the machine but he starts
staggering and slurring his speech
PHIN (CONTD)
No pencils That’s cheating
pencils are for standardized
tests

MRS SULLIVAN
Mr Sage
Phin’s words start to trail off as he reaches the machine Jason
and Mikey yank their arms out and take cover behind Mrs
Sullivan as Phin collapses against the window of the machine
sliding down it to the floor

MRS SULLIVAN (CONT’D)
Mr Sage Are you okay

Mrs Sullivan kneels to help him as some of the kids scream

As his eyes start to close Phin can see Mikey back with his
pencil in the vending machine Phin tries to reach for him but
he is too weak He closes his eyes slipping into

unconsciousness

TITLE EVERYONE IS HAVING FUN BUT YOU

The titles appear over a series of 80’s era photos depicting two
YOUNG BOYS in various competitions - races climbing wrestling
measuring how tall they are comparing captured fish hunting
Easter eggs etc

OVER BLACK

Electricity can be heard humming followed by a loud pop It
sounds like a giant camera flash is charging then firing

FADE IN

Phin opens his eyes to see a wall of baby blue He looks down to
see that he is wearing a paper gown and his feet are hanging
out of an MRI tube Phin closes his eyes

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EVENING

Phin is sitting in front of DR ECHOLLS A lighted wall behind
Dr Echolls is covered with CT scans of Phin’s brain
Dr Echolls is talking to Phin but we can’t hear anything Dr
Echolls keeps pointing to a small dark area on one of the scans
as he talks Phin is simply nodding along

FADE OUT

INT PHIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The door unlocks and Phin enters leaving his keys in the door

Phin’s apartment is expensive but cold It is filled with
minimalist designer furniture and has an amazing view A few
vending machines and some trophies shaped like snack foods are
the only items that give it life

Phin makes a bee-line for the

INT PHIN’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Phin stares in the mirror He feels the right side of his head
looking for a lump of any sort Matting his hair down Phin
tries to compare the left and right sides of his head

Phin grabs an electric razor and shaves off a patch of hair just
above and behind his right ear He examines the area applying

pressure to it Nothing He tries to brush his remaining hair

over the patch

INT PHIN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Phin walks past two vending machines that contain snacks and
candy to arrive at one filled with miniature bottles of alcohol
Phin grabs two quarters out of a bowl filled with change sitting
near the machines He buys himself a small bottle of vodka

Phin takes the bottle and plops down on his couch He quickly
downs the vodka and reaches for the phone Phin dials some
numbers from memory and puts his ear to the phone

PHIN

(faking happiness)
Hey Sarah’s voicemail this is Phin
Sage I know it’s been a while and we
really only went on those couple of
non-date dates but I just got some
news and I was hoping I could talk
You know it’s not that big of a deal
I hope all’s well

Phin hangs up the phone He dials a new number
PHIN (CONTD)

something important

Phin hangs up the phone and cradles his head in his hands

Phin gets up and goes back to the alcohol vending machine He
puts a few quarters in and pushes the buttons The vending
machine goes through the actions but the alcohol gets stuck on
the coil and doesn’t drop

Phin picks up a gumball machine that is next to the vending
machine and slams it through the glass showering gum and glass
everywhere He pulls out the bottle that he tried to buy
INT PHIN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Phin is sitting on the couch amongst a dozen empty mini-bottles
He reaches up and feels his shaved patch of scalp then picks up
the phone and dials We can vaguely hear a voice talking loudly
on the other end of the phone

PHIN

Terry stops talking)

Phin hangs up the phone His eyes turn red and well with tears
as he curls up and lays down on the couch

FADE OUT

EXT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Sitting solitary on a large plot of land is a weathered yet
oddly bright baby-blue two-story house with white trim a white
porch and an un-maintained yard The house has clearly seen
quite a few years though it is still in respectable shape It
feels like the east-coast Though the Atlantic cannot be seen
it can’t be too far

A taxi pulls up and Phin steps out He surveys his childhood
home and cracks a genuine smile for the first time As he walks
to the house he looks at his old basketball hoop above the
garage He runs his hand over the bushes lining the walkway to
the front door

INT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Phin slowly opens the front door dragging his expensive-looking
suitcase inside

PHIN
Hello Dad

Not seeing anyone Phin heads into the living room

The house is very open with the kitchen attached to the living
room

Knickknacks fill the space giving the impression that the owner
had a great deal of money in the early 80’s but has not since
been able to afford updating A drink cart leather couch
techno-futuristic lamps and clock an Apple II etc Amongst all
of this are a few sheep collectibles Glass sheep porcelain
sheep a sheep pin cushion and a sheep pillow on the couch

HANK SAGE 60 is sitting in an old recliner wearing a smoking
jacket smoking a Sherlock Holmes-esque pipe Though past his
prime it is clear that Hank was handsome in his day He still
has all of his hair though it is silver He resembles Phin

HANK
Phineas Don’t you know how to knock

Hank doesn’t stand He just puffs his pipe

Before Phin can answer TERRY SAGE 34 comes down from
upstairs Terry doesn’t quite look like he fits with the other
two Though younger than Phin he is a few pounds heavier a
few inches shorter and a few hairs shy on top He hugs Phin

TERRY
Hey Phin

PHIN
Hey Ter

TERRY

Did you bring me anything

Phin hesitates He then reaches into a pocket on his suitcase
He pulls out a blue and white striped scarf He tosses it to
Terry Terry smiles and starts wrapping it around his neck

TERRY (CONT’D)
Thanks

PHIN
I brought something for you too Dad

HANK
You didn’t answer my question

PHIN
Why would I have to knock

HANK
Why wouldn’t you Who knows what you
could have walked in on me doing in
the privacy of my own home

Phin thinks about it for a second but forces himself to stop
PHIN
Sorry Dad It’s good to see you
How’ve you been

HANK
What are you doing here

PHIN
Oh a cab just dropped me off

TERRY
A cab I thought you’d take a limo

PHIN
It was just from the airport--

HANK
You really should have called ahead

PHIN
I told Terry last night that I was
coming

TERRY
(to Hank)
And I told you

HANK
Well I figured you weren’t serious

Phin’s smile has faded but he is forcing himself not to get
angry

PHIN
Well then surprise I guess

Phin moves in to give Hank a hug At that very moment instead
of standing up Hank leans back in his recliner to pull another
pipe out of an end-table drawer Phin pulls back from the
failed hug

Hank holds the pipe offering it to Terry Terry reaches for
the pipe but Hank pulls it back

HANK
What about your smoking jacket

TERRY
It smells like smoke

HANK
That’s what it’s for It absorbs the
smoke

Hank takes a puff and looks to Phin asking as if he already
knows the answer
HANK (CONT’D)
You don’t smoke do you

PHIN
No

HANK
Of course not

There is an awkward standoff-ish silence Terry looking
uncomfortable breaks it

TERRY
So Phin you seeing anyone

PHIN
No not at the moment

HANK
Really Prospects

PHIN
Not really

HANK
You know Terry proposed once

TERRY
Twice actually Dad

HANK
We don’t count the second one

Terry shamefully nods

HANK (CONTD)
Same girl Still Terry’s putting
himself out there You have to place
bets if you want to beat the house

PHIN
I’m not trying to beat anything

Hank stands up to examine Phin

HANK
Get yourself out of the snack
business That will only get you
girthy women and future diabetics And
maybe if you’d just fix yourself up a
bit

Hank looks Phin up and down He notices the missing patch
hair on Phin’s head

of
HANK (CONT’D)
What on earth happened to your hair

Phin pauses for a second as he prepares to answer

TERRY
Fantastic Sam’s

HANK
Can’t you afford more than an eight
dollar haircut

TERRY
They aren’t as fantastic as
advertised

PHIN

No it wasn’t Sam’s Dad Terry I
need to tell-

HANK
Phineas let me stop you for a moment
I think we are old enough where you
don’t have to call me dad anymore

PHIN
What

HANK
You can just call me by my name

PHIN
You want me to call you Hank

HANK
Actually you can call me by my last
name Sage

PHIN
That is our last name

HANK
Well it was mine first

PHIN
I am not going to call you Sage

HANK
Don’t be so stubborn You were lucky
I lived my whole life with a bland
name I gave you a unique name
Phineas

PHIN
You just let Terry call you Dad

HANK
Terry knows my pain Your mother
named him

TERRY
I can call you Sage

HANK
No it’s not necessary
(to Phin)
So you had something you wanted to
tell us

PHIN
No it’s not important anymore

HANK
Then it looks like you wasted your
money on a plane ticket and a cab
ride

TERRY
Good thing you didn’t take a limo

Phin sighs and marches to the door leaving his bag behind

TERRY (CONTD)
Where are you going

PHIN
Ill be back later

EXT RURAL ROAD - DAY

Phin slowly walks down the side of the road toward a small town
in the distance He watches a car drive by and suddenly

PHIN (VO)

Dad can I have some money for dance
tickets tomorrow

INT BUICK - FLASHBACK - DAY

Phin 15 sits in the back seat while Hank drives Terry 13
is riding shotgun

TERRY
Yeah me too

Hank hands each of them a couple dollars

TERRY (CONTD)
This is only enough for one ticket

PHIN
What if we want to bring dates

Hank snatches the money from Phin’s hand and gives it to Terry
Terry is momentarily pleased

HANK
Go buy two tickets and bring them back
to me Bring me pictures of your
dates tomorrow and the one with the
cutest girl gets both tickets

PHIN
But Dad

HANK
This is how the world works boys

EXT SMALL TOWN - PRESENT - DAY

Phin is walking into main street of a small town

INT DINER - DAY

Phin enters the diner and takes a seat at the bar BETH the
waitress walks up and smiles She is 35 with short blonde hair
and is attractive despite the fact that she looks a bit tired

PHIN
Do you have any green tea
(reading her name tag)
Beth
She smiles and shakes her head

PHIN (CONT’D)
Caramel mocha

BETH
Sorry I can pour some Ovaltine ina
cup of coffee if you want

Phin thinks for a second

PHIN
Yeah okay

As Beth walks away to get the Ovaltine a PATRON is heard

PATRON
Sugar please

BETH
Aren’t you sweet enough already

PATRON
(very seriously)
It’s not for me It’s for the cereal

This comment catches Phin’s ear He looks over at the patron

BETH
I know Simon I’m just here’s that
sugar

PATRON
Thank you

Recognition sweeps Phin’s face

PHIN
Literal

The patron looks at Phin He is SIMON “LITERAL” WALKER 36
neatly kept hair and clothes He looks confused

PHIN (CONTD)
Literal it’s Phin

LITERAL
Phineas Q Sage

PHIN
Yeah

LITERAL
Wow I haven’t seen you in 8 years 5
months

PHIN
Um alright

LITERAL
How have you been

PHIN
Oh you know

LITERAL
No I don’t

PHIN

(chuckling)
It’s had its ups and downs Lately
more downs

LITERAL
Why

PHIN
I’m sure you remember that my dad and
brother can be real dicks

LITERAL
I remember they were pirates one
Halloween

Phin has no response He ignores the comment

PHIN
I flew into town because I had
something to tell them and they
wouldn’t let me get a word out
(beat)
You know what the first thing my dad
did when I came back

LITERAL
Said hi

PHIN
He started comparing me to Terry just
like when we were kids You’d think
he’d be over all this competitive

shit
LITERAL
Who won
PHIN
I don’t know Terry But that’s not
the point
LITERAL

What’s the point
Phin thinks about the question

PHIN
I I don’t know

Beth drops off the Ovaltine-coffee with a smile Phin watches
her walk away

PHIN (CONT’D)
Is that Beth Andrews

LITERAL
Yes

PHIN
Damn I thought she got the hell out
of dodge

LITERAL
I believe she actually drives a Ford

Phin gives literal a blank look

EXT SAGE HOUSE - EVENING

Literal pulls up outside the Sage House as Phin sits in the
passenger seat reading a pamphlet

PHIN
Youve got Asperger’s syndrome

LITERAL
That’s what they tell me

PHIN
We always thought you were just very
serious

LITERAL
I am

Phin smiles hops out of the car and waves to Literal

INT SAGE HOUSE - EVENING

Phin silently walks into the house He looks into the dining
room and see the empty table Suddenly

INT SAGE HOUSE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

Phin 12 sits at the dinner table with Hank 36 and Terry 10
They are finishing eating dinner but there are only two
cupcakes left for dessert

While the boys are still finishing their dinner Hank eats his
last bite then takes one of the cupcakes and shoves it in his
mouth

The two boys notice that there is only one cupcake left and
begin frantically finishing their meals Phin finishes first
and reaches for the cupcake Terry notices and stops eating
even though his plate isn’t clear He also grabs for the
cupcake

HANK
(mouth full of cupcake)
Wait

PHIN
But Terry didn’t finish

TERRY
We can split it

Hank takes a swig of milk

HANK
No there are no splits in life
Well have to think of a fair way to
settle this
(thinking)
Are you boys too full for a butter-
knife fight

They nod

HANK (CONTD)
Hmm Terry list your friends

TERRY
John Rick Ned Paul uhh Andy
Jessica

HANK
Six Phin

PHIN
Matt Paul-

TERRY
I already called him

PHIN
He’s my friend too

HANK
Keep focused

PHIN
Ken Ike Ralph Tommy and Literal
That’s seven

Phin grabs for the cupcake Hank slaps his hand away

HANK
Literal The retarded kid He doesn’t
count

PHIN
He’s not retarded he’s just really
serious

HANK

Still he’s actually more of a
negative point I think that boy is
actually stopping you from getting
more friends So that’s five to six

Terry snatches the cupcake and shoves it in his mouth

INT SAGE HOUSE - PRESENT - NIGHT

RETURN TO

Hank notices Phin from the couch before he turns back to

watching TV

pipe

HANK
I knew youd be back

PHIN
I told you I would

HANK
Well I would have known anyway

PHIN
Where’s Terry Did he go home

HANK
Home He lives here

PHIN
What happened to his house

HANK
Bank took it

PHIN
Then where is he

HANK

Playing with his dog down the street
When he moved in I told him he’d have
to have it put to sleep because he
couldn’t bring it with him Instead
he just hid it in an abandoned barn
about a mile down He doesn’t know
that I know

(beat)
So what did you want to tell us

PHIN
We should wait for Terry

HANK
He could be gone for a while

Phin takes a seat next to Hank

He is watching Hollywood Squares smoking his

PHIN
Fine but can you pay attention to me
for a second

HANK
I am paying attention

PHIN
No you’re not

HANK
Huh

PHIN
See

HANK

Okay I’m paying attention now
Hank turns from the TV to look at Phin
PHIN
Dad I was at work yesterday and I got
dizzy and had a black out
Hank’s eyes have strayed back to the TV
PHIN (CONTD)
Dad pay attention I passed out Hit
the floor
HANK
And now you’re back on your feet Cut
to the chase
PHIN

I didn’t come all this way to tell you
I fell down

Hank is beginning to feel the seriousness of this conversation
He tries to mask his concern

Suddenly Terry bursts in the front door out of breath his
black shirt covered in dog fur

TERRY
Hey guys

Hank clears his throat

HANK
Terry

Hank seems relieved by Terry showing up to break the tension

HANK (CONT’D)
Where have you been

TERRY
Oh just out for a jog

HANK
That’s it

TERRY
That’s all

Hank looks down to see a bulge in Terry’s pocket

HANK
What’s that

Terry pulls out a chewed-up tennis ball

TERRY
Oh found it outside Thought I’d
pick it up in case someone lost it
You guys watching the squares

HANK
Circle just picked Whoopi for the win

Terry sits down on the other side of Phin Phin is now in the
middle of the two men watching TV Phin is frustrated

PHIN
Terry Dad

TERRY
Hold on

Phin can’t take it anymore He blurts it out
PHIN
I’ve got a brain tumor I’m going to
die
Terry snaps his gaze over to Phin He is shocked

TERRY
What

PHIN
Diagnosed yesterday

Hank is still watching the TV though he’s looking more toward
the ground than at the actual screen He can’t bring himself to
look at Phin There is a long pause

TERRY
Are they going to fix you

PHIN
They can’t
(turning to Hank)
Do you have anything to say Dad

HANK
Youre being dramatic Always were

PHIN
Did you not just hear what I told
Terry It’s inoperable I’ve got a
few weeks tops

HANK

You’re not going to die You’ve got
enough money to buy whatever it is you
need to get it fixed Not like these
poor people

(nodding to the TV)
When your next meal is riding on Louie
Andersons ability to answer a
question about the renaissance then
you can start to worry

PHIN
I should have expected this

TERRY
Sage you should probably turn the TV
off

HANK

For this hypochondriac

Terry starting to tear up takes the remote and turns off the
TV

PHIN
I’m dying Dad I wish I could throw
money at it but it won’t help
anything You know as well as I do
that sometimes people just can’t be
fixed

That remark seems to sting Hank a bit
HANK
So then what are you going to do

with your money

PHIN
My money Aren’t you even sad
HANK
Iam It’s just a bad week I mean
I was already sad from when Princess
Diana died

PHIN
That wasn’t this week

HANK
It was the anniversary and they kept
playing that candle song You just
can’t expect me to be sad for an
entire week I just need some time
I can be sad next week or so

TERRY
He has been pretty sad this week

PHIN
Don’t defend him
(to Hank)
You want to know what I am doing with
my money I’m dying and you’re
looking for a hand-out

Hank points to the remote control

HANK
Could you hand me that

PHIN
No And you’re not getting any of my
money

HANK

So what are you going to do with it
Give it to orphans or cripples or
something

TERRY
Or crippled orphans

PHIN
Yeah I think I will What do you
think of that Dad

HANK
Terry hand me the remote

Terry does and Hank starts flipping channels

PHIN
Is that it No money no conversation

Hank doesn’t respond

PHIN (CONTD)
I’ve always had to compete with Terry
or the TV for your attention I have
to compete with a dead princess for
your grief Now you want to know what
I’m doing with my money You want me
to just hand it over to you

Phin outraged jumps up and reaches for something to throw
It’s a stack of paper napkins on an end-table He attempts to
throw them across the room Instead of flying they softly
float to the ground not going any farther than a few pathetic
feet further frustrating Phin

Hank smirks still staring at the TV Phin takes a deep breath
slightly defeated

Phin now has Hank’s attention

HANK
You’re right Phineas We should
compete for the money Me versus
Terry

PHIN
What Are you even listening to me

HANK
Yes Life is a competition and death
should be too It will be like when
you boys were kids

TERRY
Except me versus Sage

PHIN
Stop calling him that I just told
you you’re not getting the money

HANK
Fuck the orphans We’re family
Phineas Everything you have is

because of me I paid for your
education and all of those expensive
hyper-color shirts you used to buy as
a kid I supported you for 16 anda
half years

PHIN
And I repaid you by paying off your
mortgage All I wanted was a few
minutes of attention or something I
don’t even know what I was expecting

TERRY
You don’t have to do this We could
just split the money

HANK
How would that teach you boys
anything

TERRY

I’m fine with 70 30

HANK
80 20

Terry considers

HANK (CONTD)
Fine then let the games begin

PHIN
This is absurd

Terry looks back and forth between Phin and Hank not knowing
what to do Hank narrows his eyes at Terry Terry’s expression
quickly changes to a competitive scowl

TERRY
When do we start

HANK
We just did I’m in the lead for
coming up with the idea

TERRY
Damn

PHIN
You guys do whatever you want You
are both fucking insane

Hank watches as Phin leaves the room and heads up the stairs

PHIN (CONTD)
I’m staying in my old room

HANK
(to Terry)
I get credit for that
PHIN (0S)
No
HANK

I kept it clean

INT SAGE HOUSE - PHIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Phin looks around his room It’s filthy littered with artifacts
of childhood still mostly intact from when he occupied it A
dresser a few pictures ceramic art projects An old-school
arcade hockey game table with plastic players clear dome and
digital scoreboard straddles the bed The layer of dust shows
that it hasn’t been used in a while

Phin pokes through some boxes stored in the room Legos
Christmas lights a gumball machine a large 80’s style
camcorder A SPIDER

Phin jumps back then kicks the box smashing the spider As he
kicks the box it jingles with glass hitting glass

Phin looks in the box to see a nativity set He pulls out a
small sheep figurine

HANK (VO)
Phineas I’ve already told you
You’re too big to be the baby Jesus

EXT TOWN PARK - EVENING - FLASHBACK

It is snowy outside and Hank is dressed in robes and a fake
beard He is Joseph in a nativity scene He is holding bundled
up baby Terry Terry is the baby Jesus Phineas 4 sits ina
sheep costume arms curled They are surrounded by life-sized
cardboard biblical figures and farm animals

HANK
Terry is the perfect size
(frowning at Phin)
and still without sin

PHIN
Why can’t I be a wise-man

HANK
I think you answered that question
when you didn’t know what myrrh was

PHIN
I’m cold Can I have my jacket

HANK
Sheep don’t wear jackets They also
stand on all fours

Phin leans over and stands on his hands and knees

HANK (CONT’D)
Don’t look so sad We’re having fun

Hank smiles and winks at an attractive woman walking past

RETURN TO

INT SAGE HOUSE - PHIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Phin sits on the exposed foot of the bed and holds his head as
if he has a splitting headache He nods to himself pops a few
aspirin then crawls under the hockey table to lay on the bed
Only Phin’s feet are sticking out

Phin’s cell phone rings startling him He jumps a bit and
bangs his head on the underside of the hockey table

Phin wriggles out from under the table and answers his phone

PHIN

INT BETH’S CAR - NIGHT

Beth is driving a beat up 80’s Ford Mustang It was the hottest
thing on the road in the 80’s Phin is in the back seat

The front passenger seat has no cushion just springs It’s too
damaged for him to use

PHIN
Just take a left up there So how
long have you lived around here

Beth chuckles looking at Phin in her rear-view mirror

BETH
You know damn well who I am

PHIN
Why do you say that

BETH
Cause everyone in school knew who I
was Phin Sage

Phin smiles caught off guard

PHIN
You know who I am

Beth smiles

BETH
You were going to ask me to a dance

PHIN
Did you steal my diary or something

BETH
It’s a small town Your brother told
Jenny McCoy that your dad wouldn’t
give you money for tickets because he
didn’t think I was pretty enough

Phin is now thoroughly embarrassed

PHIN
Yeah I’m I’m really sorry about
that

BETH

It’s alright Gave me an eating
disorder for a few years though

PHIN
Seriously

BETH

No

(beat)
Well actually kinda It’s okay

Beth pulls up to

EXT SAGE HOUSE - NIGHT

Thanks for the ride and sorry

BETH
Youre not like them are you

PHIN
I try my best but I have my weak
moments

Phin gets out and heads toward the house as Beth drives away

INT SAGE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Phin is going into his room when Terry sticks his head out into
the hallway

TERRY
Pst

Phin walks over to Terry

PHIN
What

TERRY
Where’d you go

PHIN
To get some food What does it
matter

TERRY

Did you bring me anything

Phin reaches in his pocket and pulls out a few after-dinner
mints He gives them to Terry Terry immediately starts
unwrapping and eating them

PHIN
Good night

TERRY
Wait Don’t be too hard on Dad Do
you remember back when Princess Diana
really died

PHIN
Yeah Dad called me Still I’m his
son She was just some public figure

TERRY
He called you because everyone got so
wrapped up that no one remembered that
it was the same day that mom died

Phin pauses for a second

PHIN
I was barely old enough to remember
mom let alone the day she died

TERRY
still

PHIN
It was like the apocalypse when you
had that melanoma scare

TERRY
That was a false alarm

PHIN
Exactly

Phin walks away from Terry

TERRY
Phin

Phin stops and looks back

TERRY (CONTD)
I’m sorry you’re dying I really am
(whispering)
I cried while you were gone

PHIN
Thanks

Terry nods and Phin goes into his room

FADE OUT

INT SAGE HOUSE - PHIN’S ROOM - DAY

Something takes up Phin’s entire field of vision It is like the
inside of the MRI machine but it is making different sounds
Clicking noises mixed with some shuffling It is the bottom of
the hockey table

Phin pulls his head out from under the hockey table to see that
Hank and Terry are playing it Phin rubs the sleep from his
eyes

PHIN
What time is it

TERRY
Six

PHIN
Why are you playing hockey over my
bed

Hank smashes the controls into the game with a loud crack

HANK
Round one of the competition Excuse
us for the intrusion on your life but
I thought this could be something fun
we could do as a family The teams
and the ref The movies and Ebert

TERRY
The wheel and fortune

Phin flashes Terry a puzzled look

HANK
No (to Phin) but you get the idea
PHIN
I don’t want any part of your stupid
competition
Phin starts to get up
HANK

No stay there We need a ref

PHIN
The players are plastic

HANK
Just for a minute Time’s almost out

Hank shoots the puck near the goal but it doesn’t go in Hank
lifts his end of the table tilting the puck in Terry’s goal
just as the buzzer goes off

HANK (CONTD)
A hat-trick I win

PHIN
You can’t tilt the table

TERRY
You can’t

HANK
You don’t know our rules And You
didn’t want any part of this

PHIN
Then why did you make me ref

HANK
(to Terry)
Youd have lost anyway

Hank stretches his arms triumphantly

HANK (CONT’D)
Chalk one up for me

PHIN
Who is keeping score

TERRY
He is

PHIN
So I assume he’s winning

Terry looks to Hank Hank looks guilty

HANK
It’s not my fault I’m just really
good
(to Terry)

I’1l race you down stairs

Terry nods and starts to run for the door as Hank reaches for a
ceramic dinosaur on one of Phin’s shelves It looks as though
it was an art project from the 3rd grade

Hank proceeds to slam the dinosaur at Terry’s feet shattering
it covering the floor with sharp ceramic shards Hank bursts
out the door toward the stairs

Terry frantically tries to dance through the shards wincing as
he steps on a few on his way out the door

INT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Phin is in the kitchen at the stove cooking up some scrambled
eggs and some Eggo waffles cook in the toaster Hank and Terry
sit waiting at the table

HANK
I think we should play another round
of hockey later

TERRY
You always win

HANK
Then some practice will do you good

PHIN
Dad I want you to stop It’s
ridiculous

Hank acts as if he couldn’t even hear Phin

PHIN (CONTD)
Dad I’m talking to you

Still no response

PHIN (CONT’D)
Hank

Nothing Phin sighs
PHIN (CONTD)
(sighing)

I’m not going to call you Sage

Hank glares at Phin Phin drops a plate full of Eggos and eggs
on the table

HANK
Glad to see you are trying to earn
your keep Did you make some for
yourself

PHIN
No

Phin exits the kitchen

TERRY
Do you want to play hockey for fun

HANK
It’s not fun when you keep losing

Hank takes a big bite of Eggo

INT DINER - DAY

Phin takes a seat at the bar Beth is working at the counter
She catches Phin staring at her He tries to glance away but
she’s already on her way over She’s holding a cup of coffee

BETH
You must really like Ovaltine and

coffee

PHIN
Or really hate it back home You
know one or the other

BETH

Or both

Beth gives a little extra smile with that comment Phin pauses
for a moment building up some courage

PHIN
I was thinking if you aren’t busy
after your shift I’m going on a field-
trip with Literal tonight--

BETH

Field trip

PHIN
Yeah I don’t know being back
in town sort of reminded me of a few
things I never really got to do I
don’t have much else to do and Id
love to hear what you’ve been up to

since high school

BETH

Went away to college my dad got sick
I came back here to take care of him
I became a waitress here because it
fit my hours while I crammed in some
community college when I could My
dad passed and I got the house Now
you’re all caught up

PHIN
Maybe we could talk about what lies

ahead

Beth gives a sad laugh
some other patrons

Beth walks off to pour some coffee for

Phin stunned takes a sip of his coffee Beth walks back

BETH
It’s not really as bad as it sounds
Not all the time anyway

PHIN
Still you definitely need a field

trip

Beth smiles

EXT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Phin is driving up to the house in Hank’s car

Hank and Terry are standing outside of the house in matching
track suits complete with sweatbands Hank is in green and
Terry is in blue They are both stretching

Phin parks the car and hops out

HANK
You stole my car

PHIN
Borrowed

Phin walks over to the two men looking them up and down

TERRY
(pleading eyes)
Please If you don’t Sage will

Terry stares at Phin until he caves

PHIN
Fine

HANK
The object is to not smile laugh or
wince No talking no touching
Blinking is allowed but only for a
normal amount of time
PHIN
Okay What are the other two events

HANK
Privileged information Let’s get
this show on the road

Hank and Terry wiggle their faces a bit then face each other

nose to nose

PHIN
Alright 1 2 3

Hank immediately spits in Terry’s face Terry yells and

recoils

HANK
I win

PHIN
You said no touching

HANK
I didn’t touch him

PHIN
Terry wins by default

HANK
That’s not fair Terry you know I
obeyed the rules

TERRY
(unsure of what to say)
I guess it wasn’t specifically
outlined but the implications

PHIN
Terry you won Don’t back down

HANK
Hey you said you didn’t want any part
of this competition I win

Hank throws Phin a shit-eating grin Phin isn’t amused

PHIN
Terry won

Dropping his grin Hank glares at Terry while sliding two

fingers across his own throat

PHIN (CONTD)
Dad

HANK
What

CUT TO
CLOSE UP OPERATION BOARD GAME
The operating tool is removing the charlie horse from the knee
It clicks against the side-wall but the buzzer doesn’t buzz
INT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Sitting on the living room floor Terry holds the operating tool
as Hank and Phin watch Terry pulls his hand back

TERRY
I hit the side

HANK
Then that’s game

PHIN
The buzzer didn’t go off

HANK
You heard him he hit it

PHIN
Why’d you tell him It didn’t buzz

TERRY
To be fair
PHIN
Do you really think he would have been
“fair”
HANK
Yes
PHIN

I asked Terry
Terry glances at Hank

TERRY
Probably

A grin sweeps Hank’s face Phin huffs in frustration

HANK
Youre taking this too seriously
Phineas Everyone is having fun but
you

PHIN
How is Terry having fun You spit in
his face

TERRY

Most of it just went in my mouth

PHIN
That doesn’t matter

HANK
The next event is basketball

PHIN
No youre not picking this one

HANK
You said you came home to remember
your childhood

PHIN
No I didn’t

Hank continues talking right over Phin

HANK
-and I used to let you kids play
basketball all the time

PHIN
You let Terry play basketball You
made me try to run around with my
ankles tied together

HANK
You were taller and faster You
needed to be handicapped

PHIN
We were kids playing a game

HANK
The game of life Terry--

Hank motions as if throwing a fade away shot then points his
fingers at his own eyes then to Terry signaling that he’s got
his eyes set on him Hank then leaves

Terry can see that Phin is frustrated behind measure Terry
walks up next to him

TERRY
(sympathetically)
He’s just wants us to have some fun
You know he’s always been like this
Phin

Phin too angry to respond nods at Terry then leaves

INT SAGE HOUSE - HANK’S BEDROOM - DAY

The only items on the walls are a few scattered ribbons and
trophies for track archery golf shot-put On the dresser
there is a framed photo of a beautiful woman It’s Hank’s wife
She is 6 months pregnant and standing with a toddler Hank
isn’t in the photo On the walls are a few similar photos
None with Hank

Hank is starting to take his sweatbands off when a loud THUMP is
heard It sounds like a body falling Hank finishes slowly
hanging up his sweatbands and strolls into

INT SAGE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Hank is still walking at a regular pace toward Phin’s room

INT SAGE HOUSE - PHIN’S ROOM - DAY

Hank bursts through the door pretending as if he had ran He
sees Phin using the bed to lift himself off the ground

HANK
What the hell happened

PHIN
Just lost my balance Got a little
dizzy that’s all I’m going to
borrow your car

HANK
Like hell you are You can’t even
walk straight That car is a classic

PHIN
Well I already have the keys so if
you want to stop me you’re going to
have to call the police

Phin walks right past Hank Hank doesn’t try to stop him
HANK

I’m taking credit for every mile on
that odometer

PHIN
You broke the odometer trying to roll
it back

HANK

Well shit

INT SAND MUSEUM - DAY

Phin Literal and Beth walk through a small museum decorated
with display cases filled with sand Above the cases are
pictures of various beaches deserts and shorelines Children
and teachers move from exhibit to exhibit

Literal looks fascinated Beth looks confused and Phin looks
disappointed Literal bounces from exhibit to exhibit getting
farther away

PHIN
Not quite as magical as I had
imagined

BETH

You never came here for school

PHIN
My dad wouldn’t sign the field-trip
consent form Told me I could get
some horrible disease from the sands
of Asia

BETH
(nodding seriously)
One kid did

PHIN
Really
BETH
No
Phin smiles
PHIN

He let my brother go a year later
Said Terry was more resilient I know
this place is boring but I needed to
see it

BETH
I understand Things always seem
better when you miss out on them

Phin looks at some of the sand One of the bigger cases is
open He reaches in and runs his fingers through the sand

BETH (CONTD)

So what has kept you so busy all
these years that you couldn’t come
back and visit the museum

PHIN
Are you prepared to be impressed
Beth nods excitedly

PHIN (CONTD)
Vending machines Designing creating
stocking selling The works

BETH
So you sell giant candy dispensing
robots

PHIN

I guess that’s one way to look at it

BETH
So with the fast paced life of
vending what brings you back to town

Phin pauses for a minute looking around the room
PHIN

Would it be too awkward if I just
didn’t answer that

BETH
Yeah
PHIN
Well you know I’m just trying

not to forget the family completely

BETH
I didn’t think you were very close
from the way you were talking about
them

PHIN
We’re not That’s why I had to get
out of the house When I got back they
started this insane competition thing

BETH
On a team

PHIN
Against each other

BETH
For your love

PHIN
What No

Phin chuckles at the thought

BETH
Then what are they competing for

PHIN
Uhhh A vending machine I made the
mistake of mentioning that I had an
extra one laying around and they
decided it should be theirs

Beth nods patronizingly

BETH
Well don’t let them push you around
Besides I could use a vending
machine Maybe you should just give

it to me

PHIN
Where’s the fun in just giving it
away

Beth smiles Phin thinks about what he’s just said

Literal walks back up to Phin and Beth He is rubbing his eye

LITERAL
I’ve got sand in my eye I’m ready to
leave

PHIN

Do you need a ride home

Literal shakes his head and walks out of the museum Phin
shrugs and goes back to looking at sand

PHIN (CONT’D)
Well then Is there anywhere else to
eat in this town other than your work

BETH
Not really

PHIN
Then what do you eat

INT BETH’S HOUSE - NIGHT
It is clear that Beth is living in her father’s old house It is
decorated for a much older person but there are colorful flairs

of youth contrasting most of the dated and worn decor

Beth and Phin are eating microwave dinners Phin takes a bite of
chicken nugget and smiles

PHIN
Mhmmm Real chicken is so overrated

Beth nods

PHIN (CONTD)
So when do I get more than just the
Beth Cliff Notes

Beth pauses for a second

BETH
What do you want to know

PHIN
I don’t know so where where is
Mr Beth
BETH
New York
PHIN
Oh
BETH

Well Ex-Mr Beth Beth was engaged
but Mr Beth said he didn’t want to
wait around for Beth’s dad to die

PHIN
Oh Sorry

BETH
It was a long time ago Besides
things are going really well with
Terry now

PHIN
What

Beth laughs and grabs the brownie on her tray and takes a bite

PHIN (CONTD)
(sarcastically)
Oh ha-ha

BETH
I bet you wish you didn’t eat your
dessert first now

Beth eats her last bite of brownie
PHIN
I used it to cleanse my pallet I
have no regrets Besides I found a
fortune cookie in your kitchen

Phin indeed pulls out a fortune cookie

BETH
Hey

Phin cracks it open puts the cookie in his mouth and hold the
paper in front of him As he reads he looks distressed

BETH (CONTD)
What’s it say

PHIN
“Help I’m trapped in some Chinese
guy’s basement”

BETH
No it doesn’t

PHIN
And my lucky number is 72

BETH
Now I know you’re lying No one’s
lucky number is 72

Beth dives at Phin trying to grab the fortune out of his hands
As Phin pulls away Beth falls on top of him They laugh as she
struggles to wrestle the paper from his grip Beth manages to
take the fortune

As Beth retreats to the other end of the couch with the fortune
Phin pounces on her Before Phin can grab the fortune back
Beth shoves it in her mouth and smiles at Phin Phin pauses

PHIN
I thought you wanted to read it

Beth’s smile fades away She spits out the fortune

BETH
I thought you’d kiss me

PHIN
Oh

Phin nods then awkwardly moves in for a kiss Beth watches
curiously as Phin closes his eyes too soon and tries to maneuver
his lips toward hers She smiles and meets him halfway

They start to kiss slowly at first but it becomes more
passionate As things start to heat up Beth runs one of her
hands through Phin’s hair As her hand passes over the patch
that Phin had shaved off Phin pulls away

Beth thinks he pulled away to start taking clothes off She
quickly starts tugging at his shirt but he isn’t lifting his
arms

BETH
What’s wrong
EXT

PHIN
I just don’t usually move this fast
Maybe we could just take it a little
slower

BETH
Youre blowing through town and you
want to take things slow

PHIN
You know I’m leaving and you want to
“take things” at all

BETH
Then why’d you even ask me to the sand
museum

PHIN

Because you know I’m not really
sure I should go Can you give me a
ride back to my house

BETH
You drove here

PHIN
I know I’m just feeling a little
light headed

BETH
Yeah sure

PHIN
Sorry

SAGE HOUSE - NIGHT

The lights are still on inside the house as Beth pulls up to

drop

Phin

Phin off
pushes up the broken front seat and leans forward

PHIN
Thanks for the ride and dinner

Terry peers out the living room window unnoticed

Beth
Phin
Beth

Phin

smiles and moves in to give Phin a quick kiss on the cheek
awkwardly tries to kiss back with a bit too much emphasis
smiles

BETH
I can do the slow thing

nods and gets out of the car

INT SAGE HOUSE - NIGHT

Phin walks into the house Before he can even close the door he
hears Hank from the living room

HANK
Did you fuck Terry’s girlfriend in my
car

Phin comes around the corner to see Hank sitting on the couch
still in his track suit

PHIN
Terrys girlfriend

HANK
The waitress Is my car at her house
while you try to air out the smell of
sex

PHIN
No And Terry isn’t dating Beth

HANK
Well he had dibs on her before you
strolled back into town

PHIN
I’m going to bed

HANK
She doesn’t want a dead guy and
Terry’s gonna be alive for a while
probably

Phin starts to walk up the stairs

HANK (CONTD)
And where is my car

PHIN
(snidely)
Don’t worry Dad We can get it
tomorrow We’ll make a game of it

INT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Holding a notebook Phin descends the stairs after just waking
up He can hear chatter coming from inside the kitchen

Phin enters the kitchen to see Hank and Terry sitting at the
table Terry looks slightly depressed

PHIN
How long have you been up

TERRY
Sage just got up I’ve been up for
about an hour

PHIN
(nodding approvingly)
An hour earlier

Phin opens up his notebook and takes a few quick notes

HANK
What the hell was that

PHIN
Nothing I just thought I’d help keep
track of things

HANK
It’s okay I’ve got it handled

Phin shrugs then writes something down in his notebook Hank
glares

HANK (CONTD)
Fine Whatever It’s nice that you’re
finally acting like part of the
family And I’m still winning Mark

that down
PHIN
Don’t worry I’ve made notes
(patronizingly)

Would you like some eggs

HANK
Yeah fine

Phin goes to the stove and starts making some scrambled eggs

HANK (CONT’D)
So when are you going to get my car

Phin shrugs and smiles He puts a piece of toast on both Terry
and Hank’s plates Terry picks up his toast and starts eating
it

PHIN
You don’t want your toast

HANK
No I don’t want my toast

Terry has just finished his toast

TERRY
Can I have it

Terry grabs the toast off of Hank’s plate

PHIN
Good

Phin opens up his notebook and makes a few marks

HANK
Wait I want the toast

Hank tries to snatch it back from Terry but Terry recoils
Phin pulls Hank back into his chair

PHIN
Let’s just have some eggs

Phin grabs the frying pan and puts an equal amount of eggs on
each plate Both Terry and Hank slowly start eating as Phin
starts cooking some more eggs

As Terry and Hank lock eyes they both begin to eat faster and
faster until they are shovelling the eggs into their mouths

PHIN (CONT’D)
How about some coffee

Phin pours each of the men cups of black coffee straight from
the stove

Hank finishes the eggs first and pours the coffee into his
mouth He immediately spits out a mixture of steam eggs and
coffee

HANK
Ahhhhh Fuck

PHIN
Are you okay

HANK
Do I sound okay I burned my damn
mouth on that shit

PHIN
That’s not good

Phin opens up his notebook and takes down a few notes

HANK
Hey I finished first

PHIN
Not from what I see

Phin looks at the table to see coffee and eggs everywhere
Terry is slowly drinking his coffee

PHIN (CONTD)
And would you look at that My shoe
is untied

Hank immediately drops to his knees and ties Phin’s shoe

PHIN (CONT’D)
Thanks

HANK
Mark it down

PHIN
You think tying my shoe is a contest
Come on Literal is picking you up
out front I’ve got something planned
for picking up the car

EXT SAGE HOUSE - DAY
Literal is sitting in his car with Terry in the back and Hank

riding up front Phin is outside the car leaning in Hank’s
window

PHIN
Literal do you remember everything I
told you

LITERAL

Not everything I don’t remember a
lot of what you said in the 80s

PHIN
How about what I told you to do with
Hank and Terry this morning

LITERAL

Phin nods Hank looks really confused

PHIN
Literal is going to drop you both half
a mile from where Dad’s car is parked
The keys are in the glove box This
is a race home

HANK
And what are you going to be doing
while we are riding the short bus
around town

PHIN
Preparing for later Have fun

LITERAL
I’m not sure I will

PHIN
You don’t have to

LITERAL
Okay

PHIN

Literal instantly starts driving away neglecting that Phin
still has his head in the window The door frame hits Phin in
the head as Literal drives off

INT LITERAL’S CAR - DAY

Hank is staring directly at Literal as he drives the car

HANK
Do you know where my car is

LITERAL
Yes

HANK
Then let’s go

Literal looks confused

HANK (CONTD)
Take me to the car

LITERAL
That’s not what I was told to do

HANK
What if I called the cops and told
them you were assisting a car thief

LITERAL
They would ask your name and location

q

TERRY
It’s part of the game Sage

HANK
Terry you’re helping me find that
car then I am taking it This isn’t
a game

TERRY
So we’ll go back together call it a
tie

HANK
No You’re walking home just in case
it’s still a game

EXT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Phin is sitting on the front porch when Hank’s car comes flying
up in a cloud of smoke Phin jumps to his feet The car is
headed at him like a bat out of hell Terry is driving

Suddenly the car’s tires lock and it skids to a stop right in
front of the house Terry bails out of the car falls in the
dirt stumbles to his feet and scrambles to Phin

TERRY
Is he here

PHIN
No You won

Terry smiles then keeps running right past Phin and into the
house The door can be heard locking

Through the cloud of dust still left by Terry Literal drives
up He is alone in the car

LITERAL
Hey Phin

PHIN
Where’s my dad

LITERAL
In my trunk

PHIN
What Is he okay

LITERAL
No He’s very angry

Phin walks over to the trunk listening carefully He can’t
hear anything at first Phin knocks on the trunk

HANK (0S)
Open this fucking trunk or I am going
to punch you in the back of the neck
Is that literal enough for you I
will give you scoliosis

Phin pops the trunk open Hank squints in the light but as
soon as he recognizes Phin he tumbles out of the trunk and into
the dirt

HANK (CONT’D)
I’m here I won

Terry sticks his head out from an open window on the second
floor of the house

TERRY
No you didn’t

HANK
You fucking cheater

Hank runs at the door of the house but it’s locked

PHIN
What happened

PHIN
Well it looks like Terry won that
part of the contest then

HANK

Phin ignores Hank’s plea
PHIN

Literal did either of them say or do
anything that seemed cruel or rude

Literal thinks for a second

QUICK FLASHES

INT LITERAL’S CAR - FLASHBACK - DAY

Quick cuts of Literal’s car when Hank Terry and Literal are
all still in it

HANK
(Literal V0)
Turn on the radio Retard

Flash

HANK (CONTD)
(Literal V0O)
Can’t you drive faster fucker

Flash
HANK (CONT’D)
(Literal V0O)

Hank grabs the steering wheel and yanks it to the side

TERRY
(Literal V0)
Ahhhhhhhh
Flash
HANK
(Literal V0)
I don’t like your haircut
Flash

HANK (CONTD)
(Literal V0O)
Can I have some gum

RETURN TO

EXT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

PHIN
Asking for gum isn’t mean Literal

LITERAL
It’s my gum

Phin looks over at Hank Hank blows a bubble Phin takes out
his notebook and takes some notes

HANK
I don’t need your money as bad as you
think

PHIN

Fine I’1ll just give it to Terry
then He’1ll probably let you live
with him

Hank glares up at a grinning Terry then back to Phin Hank
looks disgusted by the thought of living under Terry’s rule
Phin smiles

PHIN (CONT’D)
Literal you can go home Thanks for
the help

Literal doesn’t say anything He just gets in his car and
drives away

PHIN (CONT’D)
Terry unlock the door

TERRY
No

A dirt clod hits Terry on the side of the head Terry looks
down to see Hank dusting off his hands

TERRY (CONTD)
Phin

Phin looks at Hank disapprovingly at first He then takes out
his notebook

PHIN
Nice shot

As Terry brushes the dirt from his hair a car horn blares
Phin turns to see Beth driving toward him Phin looks a bit
panicked as he runs toward her car attempting to make her stop
as far from his family as possible She slows to a stop

BETH
Hey was that Simon

PHIN
Yeah

BETH
Did he take you to get your car

PHIN
Uh sort of Why are you here

BETH
I saw someone driving your car away
from my house like a bat out of hell
I thought I’d come by and make sure it
found its way home

Phin nods and points to the car
PHIN
And as you can see it did Sorry you

had to drive out here just for that

Phin glances back at Hank and Terry as they stare at Beth Beth
waves They both wave back

PHIN (CONT’D)
You wanna get some lunch or something

BETH
I’ve got work in an hour

PHIN
That’s plenty of time Just wait here
while I go grab my wallet
Beth nods Phin walks very briskly toward the front door

PHIN (CONT’D)
Terry unlock the door

Terry doesn’t move

PHIN (CONTD)
Now Terry

Terry sinks back inside the window to go unlock the door

As Phin waits at the door Hank starts to walk out to Beth’s
car Just as Phin is about to go stop Hank the door unlocks
Phin hesitates for a moment then shoves Terry out of the way as
he runs into the house

INT SAGE HOUSE - PHIN’S ROOM - DAY

Phin checks the night-stand in his room No wallet He shuffles
through the unmade bed in his room No wallet He looks under

the bed No wallet

Phin runs out of his room and down the hall into

INT SAGE HOUSE - HANK’S BEDROOM - DAY

As Phin enters the room he pauses for a minute noticing the
pictures of his mother He suddenly notices a wallet sitting on
Sage’s dresser Phin opens it to see his ID This is Phin’s
wallet Phin checks the wallet Everything seems to be in order
except there is no cash

PHIN
Dammit

Phin looks out the window to see that Hank is talking to Beth
while Terry is standing at an awkward distance away from the
car just close enough to observe but not close enough to
interact Phin can’t see Beth’s expression from this angle

EXT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Phin bursts out the front door He locks eyes with Beth She’s
still smiling A load is taken off Phin’s shoulders as he
briskly jogs over to her car Hank is mid-sentence

HANK
it’s just better hygienically We
learned that by the time Terry came
around Phineas’s was such a bitch to

clean

PHIN
What is your problem

Phin is already scratching in his notebook by the time Hank
realizes he’s there

HANK
Why are you doing that

PHIN
Because you are telling girls about my

foreskin again

HANK
I was talking about diapers Cloth
versus disposable

Phin stops Embarrassment sweeps his face as he looks at Beth

BETH
He was telling me about your foreskin

Hank snaps at Beth for ratting him out

HANK
That information was for your benefit

Phin starts writing in the notebook again

PHIN
-And for lying

HANK
(to Beth)
You want the truth There is a man
about a hundred feet away over there
A circumcised man He is not ashamed
of his family and he loves you

TERRY

(quietly)
He’d like to get to know her better

before committing to the word ‘love’

Hank ignores Terry

HANK

-And he wont be dead in a month
BETH

What
HANK

You want proof Terry tell her your
cholesterol level

TERRY

HANK
Really Well it’s a little high but
that’s still only in the low-to-
moderate risk range

Beth isn’t paying attention to Hank and Terry anymore

BETH
Why did he say Terry wont be dead

PHIN
He’s just playing the odds

HANK
And don’t think you’re getting
Phineas’s money

Hank then realizes Beth and Phin aren’t even paying attention to
him They are staring at each other

BETH
Don’t fucking joke around What did
he mean

HANK

You didn’t tell her

PHIN
Dad

Beth stares at Phin waiting for an explanation

BETH
What does that mean

PHIN
I was going to tell you Really

BETH
Tell me what
(beat)
What

PHIN
They say I’m not doing so hot these
days

BETH
How so

Phin’s awkward frown behind a forced smile tells her he isn’t
joking Beth looks increasingly worried

PHIN
I’ve got this thing in my head a
growth

Beth starts tearing up

BETH
Like cancer

PHIN
Yeah something like that

BETH
So So what does that mean You’re
going to have to do chemo

PHIN
It’s it’s past that

BETH
So are you going

Phin reaches up and wipes his nose It’s bleeding Phin looks
at the blood on his hand

PHIN
(re the bloody nose)
It’s just dry out
(beat)
Get out of the car for a second

Phin looks back at Hank and Terry watching

PHIN (CONT’D)
Actually let’s go somewhere

Beth chokes out her words

BETH
Not right now

Beth drives off in a cloud of dust Phin stands across from
Hank dirt caking in the blood under his nose

HANK
You really should have told her

Phin sniffs some of the blood back into his nose He is
starting to tear up He is clearly quite hurt by this Without
saying anything He starts to head back to the house

TERRY
You can talk to her

HANK
Phineas I’m sorry

Phin turns around puzzled
PHIN
Youve never said ‘sorry’ to me
before Ever
A beat as Hank tries to recall a counter-example but can’t
HANK
I’m sorry you became unreasonably
attached to that girl in such a short
amount of time
Phin sighs
PHIN
(under his breath)
So close
Phin walks into the house but leaves the front door ajar
HANK

Phineas just forget her She’s not
that pretty sober anyway

INT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Phin sits on the couch He is holding a throw-pillow shaped
like a sheep to his nose One side is covered in blood Hank
and Terry creep through the doorway

Terry runs into the kitchen to grab a towel

HANK
That was your mother’s

PHIN
She wouldn’t have cared

HANK
You barely knew her

Phin glares at Hank
Terry tries to give the towel to Phin Phin shakes his head

HANK (CONT’D)
Take the towel

PHIN
I want to use the sheep

HANK
Why

PHIN
Because I do

Hank pauses then grabs for the sheep Phin jumps to his feet
to grab it back but Hank pulls it away

PHIN (CONTD)
You know you say these things you
aren’t even in any of the pictures
with her in your room

HANK
Who did you think took those

Phin is silent for a moment

TERRY
Sears

Phin finally just grabs the towel from Terry

HANK

(to Terry)
Thank you

PHIN

Fine Here’s your chance Dad I am
going to give you one shot at this
If you tell me why you’ve favored
Terry all these years why youve
treated me like this I’1ll just give
you each half of the money End of
the competition

Hank just stares at Phin Terry watches intently

PHIN (CONT’D)
Just tell me Tell the three of us

HANK
(slowly)
I want all of the money

PHIN
Fuck it Fine You get everything
Ill buy the answer from you Just
tell me

Hank stands silent staring at Phin’s bloody nose

PHIN (CONTD)
Then just admit it Admit that you
favored him That’s all You don’t
even need to tell me why Maybe you
don’t know why

Hank looks over at Terry then back to Phin

HANK
I could lie and you wouldn’t know

Phin recoils his fist still holding the bloody nose towel
ready to punch Hank He stops himself from punching Hank

In his frustration he hurls the bloody rag against the wall
leaving a blood spot

PHIN
The games go on

Phin turns around and walks into the kitchen Hank and Terry
both stand where they were

PHIN (0S) (CONT’D)
I wouldn’t want to be the last one
through this doorway

Terry slowly starts walking for the door then Hank cautiously
follows As Terry reaches the door he stops He lets Hank go
in before him

In the kitchen Phin places two pots of water on the stove then
takes out his notebook

PHIN (CONTD)
How many steps would you say you took
to get in here

HANK
I don’t know

PHIN
Well you might want to keep an eye on
that from now on

TERRY
Is it better to take more or less

PHIN
Let’s just think of it like golf

Terry stares blankly obviously not knowing how golf is scored

PHIN (CONT’D)
Less

Terry nods

Phin sticks his finger in each pot to feel the water He then
nods at the pots while looking at Hank and Terry

Hank and Terry roll up their sleeves and place their hands into
the pots of water as they heat up Both men clench their teeth

CUT TO

Terry yanks his hand out with a primal yell Hank pulls his out
immediately after He elbows the toaster and it falls off the
counter hitting the ground

-- Terry trying to descend multiple steps at a time with the
TV He looks very unstable

INT SAGE HOUSE - NIGHT
Phin is looking through the kitchen cabinets for a snack

PHIN
Terry hurry it up with that TV It’s
almost time for Wheel You don’t want
me to mark you down

Something catches his eye on the counter It is a mortgage bill
on the counter He picks it up and starts to examine it
Suddenly there is a loud crash

Phin drops the bill and runs out of the kitchen Phin gasps as
he finds Terry laying at the bottom of the stairs Cut and
bruised Terry lays in broken TV rubble Phin drops down to help
Terry up

PHIN (CONT’D)
Are you okay

Terry is taking big gasping breaths

TERRY
Yeah I think so

PHIN
Youre breathing oddly

TERRY
(in one quick breath)
I’m trying to take as few breaths as

possible

PHIN
Just breath normally You’re not on
the clock

Terrys breathing returns to normal Terry looks at the broken
TV all around him

TERRY
Am I going to get marked down for
dropping the TV

PHIN
No Of course not I’m really sorry
It’s my fault

TERRY
I want you to be fair Mark me down
for falling

PHIN
Terry the competition doesn’t matter

TERRY
Yes it does

With a few cringes of pain Terry lifts himself to his feet and
limps out the front door taking elongated strides all the way

Phin starts to clean up the TV rubble

INT LITERAL’S CAR - NIGHT
Literal is driving Phin down a dark road

PHIN
It’s just up on the left

Phin points at an abandoned-looking barn but Literal drives
right past it

PHIN (CONTD)
Didn’t you see it

LITERAL
Yes it was very old

PHIN
Just let me out here

Literal pulls over

PHIN (CONTD)
Wait until I get back

Phin hops out of the car

EXT RUN-DOWN BARN - NIGHT

The barn is empty and worn but solidly standing There is a
small light coming from inside Phin walks up to the front door

INT RUN-DOWN BARN - NIGHT

The door creaks as Phin enters The place is clean and humbly
maintained There is a light coming from the end of the hall
The light goes off Some shuffling is heard Phin heads down the
hall

PHIN
Terry

There is a loud rattling noise and the light comes back on

Phin rounds the corner Terry is standing with a flashlight in
his hand At his feet is a dead black lab with a tennis ball in
its mouth

TERRY
Phin I was just out here walking and
I I found this dead dog It was

just dead when I got here I’ve never
seen it before in my life

Phin looks around to see a bed and bowls with food and water

PHIN
So I guess we better bury it then

TERRY
No I think we should just leave it
here The raccoons and stuff can eat
it We shouldn’t upset nature’s
balance

Terry starts walking toward the door guiding Phin along with
him Suddenly the dog gets up and starts to follow

Terry thinking quickly fakes being scared and starts to run
from the dog Phin stays put and starts petting the dog

TERRY (CONTD)
Phin come on That thing could be
rabid

PHIN
I know about the dog Terry

Terry gives up the act and walks back to the dog

TERRY
Could you not tell Sage

PHIN
He’s the one that told me about it

TERRY
Oh Could you still not tell him I
don’t want him to know I know he
knows I like the dynamic we have
going as-is

PHIN
Yeah sure
(petting the dog)
What’s its name

TERRY
Terri

PHIN
You named him after yourself

TERRY
She Terri with an ‘I’ I thought
the name would make Sage not want to
put her to sleep

Phin chuckles at the fact that Terry thought that plan would
actually work

The flashlight goes out Terry pumps the flashlight up and down
in the air and it turns back on Phin looks puzzled

TERRY (CONTD)
No batteries I just shake it
(beat)
So did I lose more points for walking
out

PHIN
No-- Terry it was my fault you fell
down the stairs I’ve pushed this
thing too far You’re going to win

TERRY
(ecstatic)
Yeah I have that many more points
than Sage I thought he was putting
up a pretty good fight--

PHIN
No You don’t have any points Terry

TERRY
Then how am I winning

PHIN
There are no points There isn’t even
a contest You don’t have to try so
hard I just want to get back at dad

Terry looks heart-broken

TERRY
No You can’t do that

PHIN
Don’t you stand up for Dad Ter He
made up this whole stupid thing to
hold it over me and embarrass you

TERRY
I want to keep playing I want to
win

PHIN
Terry

Terri the dog looks at Phin

TERRY
I need to beat him Beat him fair
You need to keep judging the
competition

PHIN
I can’t give him my money He doesn’t
deserve that chance After everything
he put me through when we were kids

TERRY
Yeah he always made you lose but I
never felt like I won He always
helped me whether I wanted it or not

The flashlight goes out Terry’s emotion gets the best of him

TERRY (CONT’D)
Fuck

Terry throws the flashlight against the wall It shakes on
PHIN

I haven’t actually been keeping track
I just hold the notebook to scare Dad

TERRY
Just start with me dropping the TV
You can’t just let me win
Phin is reluctant

PHIN
Then he’s in the lead

Terry nods just before the flashlight goes off

TERRY
Can you help me find the light

In the dark the men can be heard shuffling around One of them
accidentally kicks the dog It yips

TERRY (CONTD)
Bad Terri

PHIN
I’1l see you back home

Phin can be heard walking out

INT DINER - NIGHT

Phin slowly wanders up to the bar He sits down and looks for
Beth She comes out of the kitchen holding plates not as
cheery as usual

She glances over at Phin making eye contact just long enough so
that there is no doubt that she saw him She looks away and
keeps walking delivering the food to customers

Phin buries his forehead in his palm resting his elbow on the
counter Out of the corner of his eye he notices a glass of
orange juice He lifts his head to see Beth

BETH
I’m sorry I just left I kinda
panicked Familiar territory ya
know

PHIN
I should have told you I just didn’t
want you to look at me like I was
expired milk
Phin cracks a smile Beth softens up

BETH
I’1l get you some egg-whites

Beth walks toward the kitchen Phin grabs his orange juice

PHIN
No Ovaltine-mocha and pie

BETH
This is better for you

Phin looks as though he is about to argue but lets it go

PHIN
So I’m thinking of hitting up the
water tower tonight

BETH
Are you gonna get drunk and skinny
dip

PHIN

That’s what they did So everyone
used to go drunken night swimming and
I’m the one dying young

BETH
Not funny

PHIN
I never got to go because my dad
wouldn’t let me

BETH
You weren’t supposed to ask permission
to go to the water tower Youd say
you were going to the library

PHIN
Oh You feel like doing some reading
tonight

BETH

We should get towels
Beth half smiles and goes into the kitchen

Phin looks out the diner window to see Literal waiting by the
car for him He gives Literal the ‘thumbs up’ Literal looks up
into the sky After seeing nothing Literal looks back to Phin
and shrugs Phin waves Literal away Literal nods and gets in
his car and drives off

INT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Phin bolts through the doorway as Hank calls out from living
room

HANK (0S)
You could have killed your brother

Phin walks into the living room now carrying two towels to see
Hank sitting with Terry in front of the living room TV smoking
his pipe

PHIN
Well I didn’t and I apologized

TERRY
Yeah I’m fine

HANK
And you made him break the upstairs
TV

PHIN

It looks like you’re getting along
okay without it

HANK
What if it had been a plasma TV Did
you think about that
PHIN
Then he probably wouldn’t have dropped
it
Hank has no retort Terry shrugs Phin is heading for the door

HANK
Where are you going

PHIN
Out With Beth

HANK
Take your brother with you

PHIN
What

HANK
Take Terry with you He’s bored

PHIN
But Dad

HANK
You won’t even notice him

Terry looks up at Phin with puppy-dog eyes

EXT WATER TOWER - NIGHT

Beth’s car comes tearing up a dirt road kicking dust
everywhere all the windows down stereo blaring Bryan Adams -
Summer of ‘69

EXT WATER TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

Phin Beth and Terry are all sitting on a wooden walkway around
the tower with their legs dangling off the edge The tower is
covered with the graffiti from a lifetime of teenage abuse

Phin is sitting between Beth and Terry as they all drink beer
(Natty Light) smoke cigarettes and look out over the reservoir
With them they have a couple electric lanterns a can of spray
paint and a boom-box now playing Bryan Adams - Heaven

PHIN
So this is what everyone did

BETH
It’s more exciting when you’re too
young to be smoking and drinking

Phin nods

TERRY
There were people making out and
skinny dipping and stuff too

Terry stares at Phin and Beth like that was their cue to start
making out or ripping off their clothes There is an awkward
silence before Terry goes back to his beer

PHIN
Do we have another tape

TERRY
Bryan Adams was all I could find

Phin nods determined to have an awesome time anyway

PHIN
Whatever I’m gonna paint something
What do people usually paint

BETH
(shrugging)
Go Sailors Suck balls Ben hearts
Jackie You know the go-to’s

TERRY
You should draw something Something
bad-ass

Phin thinks about it for a second staring at the tower

Phin starts to paint something Beth and Terry both stare at
it puzzled

TERRY (CONT’D)
Is that supposed to be you

PHIN
Yeah It’s me singing into a
microphone I’m rocking out
TERRY
(reserved)
Oh
Phin scoffs then looks to Beth

PHIN
Is it that bad

BETH
It looks like you are holding a penis
to your face

Sure enough it does

PHIN
What No

Terrys silence shows he agrees

Phin grabs another beer and sighs He walks up to the tower and
paints something below the picture

PHIN (CONT’D)
There Better

Phin has painted “phin (heart)s rock” all lowercase

PHIN (CONT’D)
See I heart rock

BETH
Yeah I guess it makes more sense now

TERRY
Now people will know that’s supposed
to be you

Phin knows Terry is right He glares at him

PHIN
Let’s go swimming

BETH
Wait skinny dipping

Phin looks over at Terry

PHIN
Underwear

Beth seems hesitant Phin pleas with his eyes

BETH
Alright But we need to shotgun a
beer first

Phin grabs a beer takes off his shoes then climbs down the
water tower ladder Beth follows but Terry stays sitting

PHIN
Terry

TERRY
I can’t

PHIN

Don’t be chicken

TERRY
No I can’t I don’t have a suit

PHIN
We’re going in our underwear

TERRY
I know I’m I’m going commando

PHIN
What Why

Beth is trying to hold in her laughter

TERRY
I just always have

PHIN
Really

Terry nods
PHIN (CONTD)
But that that’s not socially
acceptable

Terry shrugs Nothing he can do about it now

BETH
Phin

Phin turns to see that Beth is already in her underwear
smiling Phin is frozen as his eyes go wide She is stunning

PHIN
Alright Terry you watch the stuff

Phin starts clumsily ripping off his clothes as he chases Beth
toward the water both pounding their beers

She hesitates at the edge of the water as Phin runs past her
throwing his can and jumping in She follows It’s freezing

BETH
Fuck

Phin swims a bit then treads water as he waits for Beth

BETH (CONT’D)
Not too far

PHIN
Come on I can almost touch

Beth swims out They can’t see Terry and the tower anymore

BETH
Phin Sage are you trying to get me
alone

PHIN

Of course not I thought I might

Phin rolls his eyes back as if being coy Beth smiles It
appears that Phin is trying to make a move but he doesn’t say
anything Beth’s smile fades Something doesn’t look right

Phin suddenly slips underwater

BETH
Phin
(silence)
Phin

Beth dives underwater for a moment but comes back up without
Phin

Beth sees Terry running into the water throwing his clothes off
behind him He swims out as fast as he can

BETH (CONTD)
Terry I can’t find him

Terry dives underwater He’s down there for a while

Suddenly Terry burst through the surface but it appears to be
just Terry Terry then pulls up his arms pulling Phin above
the surface

Terry and Beth kick their way back to the shore dragging Phin
with them As Terry climbs out we can see he is bare-ass naked

As they pull Phin onto the shore he starts coughing out water
Terry lays Phin out on his back facing the sky then falls face-
down next to Phin exhausted

Beth leans over Phin wiping the water off of his face Phin
opens his eyes and looks up at her

BETH (CONTD)
Phin Oh my God Are you okay

PHIN
(coughing)
Yeah I’m good What happened

BETH
Terry saved you

PHIN
Oh God is he naked

Beth doesn’t say anything but her silence tells Phin everything
he needs to know He rolls over to face Terry

PHIN (CONT’D)
Thanks Ter

TERRY
No prob I think I got sand in my
butt

Terry looks back up at the tower

TERRY (CONTD)
From here it looks like it says Phin
hearts cock

The lower-case “r” does indeed look like a “c”

But Phin ignores Terry as he notices Beth walking back to her
pile of clothes Phin sits up

PHIN
Beth you okay

BETH
(meekly)
Yeah I’m fine Just cold

Phin walks over to her

PHIN
I’m okay really Actually it was
kinda fun

BETH
Yeah well you scared the hell out of
me I wouldn’t call that fun

PHIN
Yeah I guess not But at least you
got to see Terry naked
Beth smiles
PHIN (CONT’D)
I’m gonna go fix what I wrote on the
tower

BETH
Can we just go

PHIN
But it says I love cock

Phin smiles at Beth She looks up at the tower and can’t help
but smile

BETH
I think it’s funny

PHIN
Alright

Beth wraps her arm around Phin’s waist
PHIN (CONTD)
Can I make it up to you tomorrow
INT BETH’S CAR - NIGHT
It is the next night and Phin is in the backseat as Beth drives

PHIN
Turn left up there

BETH
Where are we going
EXT HIGHSCHOOL - NIGHT

Phin leads Beth across the dark campus past lockers and
classrooms

BETH
Why are we at the high school

PHIN
Remember how I said I was trying to
make up for a few things I missed out
on

Phin pushes open the door to the cafeteria

INT HIGHSCHOOL CAFETERIA - NIGHT

The Cafeteria is dark except for a glowing disco ball hanging in
the middle of the room making the tables and walls sparkle
Beth is shocked

Draped over a chair is a tacky blue tuxedo jacket Phin slips
it on before clipping on a bow-tie that he pulls from his
pocket

Phin also has a matching blue corsage that he places on Beth’s
wrist

PHIN
We both missed the dance because of my
Dad

BETH

I didn’t miss any dances

PHIN
Oh

BETH
But they did kinda suck How did you
do all of this

PHIN
My friend AJ

Phin waves Beth sees a small man dressed in coveralls walk over
from the corner of the cafeteria This is AJ 70 She reaches
out her hand to shake

AJ
AJ I’m the janitor

BETH
Beth I’m the date for the dance
What does AJ stand for

AJ
Alcoholic Jay

Beth laughs AJ doesn’t Beth’s laugh fades awkwardly

BETH
Oh Well thank you for setting this
all up

AJ nods and walks back over to his corner He presses play on a
boom-box “Hold Me Now” by the Thompson Twins plays Phin
grabs Beth by the hand and starts to dance with her They can
see AJ drinking from a bottle of whiskey He has two more
bottles sitting near by Beth looks at the whiskey then at
Phin

PHIN
I gave him a few bucks to set this up
He bought the booze himself

BETH
Does he need to stare at us

PHIN
That was part of the deal Just
ignore him

BETH
Are you sure you’re okay to be
dancing

PHIN

I’1l survive

Phin pulls Beth in closer She closes her eyes as they dance
around in circles

AJ
(under his breath)
Cop a feel

EXT HIGHSCHOOL - NIGHT

As they leave the dance Phin puts his coat around Beth’s
shoulders He also very deliberately leaves his arm around
her

BETH
Smooth operator

As Phin smiles at Beth he hears a clinking sound He looks
over to see one kid trying to reach up into a vending machine
and take candy off the bottom row as another kid shakes the
machine

Phin immediately pulls his arm off of Beth and runs over to
them He starts waving his hands and making odd “shoo”ing
noises with his mouth as if chasing away dogs

The kids run off

BETH (CONT’D)
Easy They’re kids not dogs

PHIN
They were trying to steal from that
vending machine

BETH
It was just a candy bar

PHIN
What if they’d had a coat hanger
Imagine what they would have taken
then

BETH
Is that what the pro’s use

PHIN
Yes

Beth laughs Phin realizes that he is being a bit crazy

PHIN (CONT’D)
I probably shouldn’t call the police

Beth walks up and puts her arms around Phin’s waist
BETH
You don’t want to be a narc on the
night of the dance

Phin smiles They walk away from the vending machines

BETH (CONT’D)
That was very “old man” of you

PHIN
I know
INT BETH’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Beth leads Phin through the door Beth takes off her coat and
throws it on the couch Phin sits down next to the coat as Beth

walks into the kitchen

BETH (0S)
Phin

PHIN
Yeah

Phin starts to get up

BETH (0S)
No Stay there

PHIN
What

BETH (0S)

It’s easier not to look at you

Phin looks over to see if she is watching him She isn’t

BETH (0S) (CONT’D)
I need to know what’s going to happen
to you

PHIN
I’m going to die

BETH (0S)
No Before that What’s going to
happen

PHIN
Oh
(long beat)
They say I could start having
seizures blackouts vision
problems headaches other things

BETH (0S)
The bloody nose

PHIN
My blood pressure is up Can’t tell
if it’s the tumor or just the stress
of it all

BETH
Which symptoms have you had already

Phin pauses for a moment not answering the question

PHIN
Well my vision is fine
(jokingly)
You’re still a cute blonde right

Beth laughs She slowly emerges from the kitchen and sits next
to Phin

BETH
What about you Like the way you act

PHIN
There’s a chance I could get brain
damage as the tumor grows Anything
from a slight personality change to
barely being able to work the door at
Wal-Mart

Phin’s answer clearly worries Beth
BETH
So this is why you took me to the sand

museum and the do-over dance

Phin shrugs

PHIN
And the water tower Things I wanted
to do Exciting huh

BETH
That’s it Not exactly dreaming big

PHIN
Well I did kinda want to build a
giant vending machine You know
really big The Voltron of vending
(Phin chuckles)
What would you do

BETH
I don’t know

Phin mimics handing Beth a phone

PHIN
Come on Make-a-Wish Foundation is on
the line If you don’t answer
they’re gonna call lupus girl

BETH
Can I wish to be cured

PHIN
That’d be nice wouldn’t it

BETH
Sorry I was just joking

PHIN
So am I Now tell me

BETH
Youll think it’s stupid

PHIN
Maybe Just tell me

BETH
I want to go to the San Diego Zoo I
want to see the baby pandas

PHIN
You don’t have to be dying to do that
You could fly out this weekend

BETH
You could I have to work and I
don’t exactly have the frequent flyer
miles

PHIN
Let me get you a ticket

Beth suddenly stops joking around
BETH
Phin Don’t do this I need to get
some sleep I have the morning shift
tomorrow
Phin nods Beth stands up
BETH (CONTD)
Where were you when I could have
actually used a ticket out of this
place

PHIN
Selling snacks and waiting

BETH
Waiting for what

Phin shrugs Beth smiles

BETH (CONT’D)
You can take my bed if you want

PHIN
I’m fine on the couch

Beth nods and walks down the hall to her room

PHIN (CONTD)
Don’t wait until you’re dying

Beth can be heard sighing

INT BETH’S HOUSE - DAY

Beth wakes up on the couch in Phin’s arms They are both
dressed just as they were last night She sees the sun seeping
in through the blinds

She shakes Phin trying to wake him up

BETH
Phin Phin

Phin doesn’t wake up She gets louder and shakes a bit harder

BETH (CONTD)
Phin

Her eyes swell as she starts to panic

BETH (CONTD)
PHIN

Phin slowly wakes up yawning and stretching

PHIN
Huh

Beth stands up quickly wipes her nose and tries to hide how
worried she had become in that moment

BETH
We need to get up I’ve got work

PHIN
Call in sick

BETH
(irritated)
No I can’t

Beth gets up and heads into her bedroom

PHIN
You’re not going to get an award for
perfect attendance

BETH (0S)
But it does affect my paycheck

PHIN
Ill pay you to stay here

Beth comes out of her room Tears stream down her cheeks

BETH
Can you please leave

PHIN
What’s the matter

BETH
Could you just go

PHIN
What happened

BETH

I don’t even have time or money to go
to the damn zoo and you think I’m
going to stay here and watch you die
all day

PHIN
I’m not dying today

BETH
Then when are you dying Next week
Next month

PHIN
Beth

BETH
I don’t want to see you anymore

PHIN
Just wait a minute

Beth does her best to subdue her emotions

BETH
Please Phineas

PHIN
Don’t call me that

BETH
You can’t do this to me Just leave
now

Phin slams the door on his way out Beth’s legs give out as she
falls on the couch face in hands

EXT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Phin is walking down the long dirty path toward the house Under
his nose is residue of a poor attempt to clean a bloody nose

INT SAGE HOUSE - DAY

Phin slouches through the doorway as Hank calls out from living
room

HANK (0S)
Your brother said he saved you

Phin walks into the living room to see Hank sitting in front of
the living room TV smoking his pipe

PHIN
Yeah he did

HANK
He doesn’t get credit for that because
I wasn’t even there I didn’t get a
fair shot at saving you

PHIN
I didn’t even think about that

Hank pauses for a beat as he tries to chose his words

HANK
Phineas Terry can’t get that money
He needs to have the chance to make it
on his own If he has all of that
given to him he’1ll never have to do
anything for himself You deserved
it he doesn’t

PHIN
And maybe if he had the money he
could move out and leave you here by
yourself Then again I didn’t have
any money when I left did I

HANK
Fine I’11 tell you why I favor
Terry

Phin stares at Hank furrowing his brow waiting to see what Hank
has come up with

HANK (CONT’D)

When you were born your head was so
large that your mother had to have a C-
section They cut her stomach open

and pulled you out

Hank pauses for a moment lowering his head

HANK (CONT’D)

Her stomach was never the same I
guess some part of me never forgave
you for mangling that gorgeous body
It was as flat as a runway before you

PHIN
Terry was the C-section

Hank thinks for a second

HANK
Hmm You still gave her stretch marks
like you wouldn’t believe

Phin forces a laugh masking his anger and sadness

PHIN
I don’t know what I was expecting
You didn’t even pay off the mortgage
with the money I gave you I found
the bill

HANK
I bought this house for your mother
I’m going to pay it off

PHIN
Then what did you do with the cashiers
check

HANK

In a drawer somewhere

Phin storms off into the kitchen Hank sighs and goes back to
watching the TV

Suddenly there is a large crash in the kitchen

Hank sits up and looks back into the kitchen to see Phin on the
ground There is a bit of blood on the edge of the counter
where he hit his head while falling The phone is off the hook

INT SAGE HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Hank is sitting on the kitchen floor holding up Phin’s head
Hank’s eyes are misty and Phin hasn’t woken up yet

Two EMTs in their early 20’s rush in with a stretcher They
load Phin onto it One EMT turns to Hank

EMT
You can ride in the ambulance

Hank looks down at Phin

HANK
Is he going be okay

EMT
I don’t know

HANK
I’1l follow in my car

EXT STREETS —- DAY

An ambulance sirens blaring races down the street Hank’s car
following

INT EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

Phin is rushed through the halls on the gurney

INT HOSPITAL - MRI ROOM - DAY

Phin is laying in the machine as it hums away scanning his
head

INT HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY

Hank is sitting in the waiting room reading Highlights magazine
A male NURSE in blue scrubs enters the waiting room

NURSE
Hank Sage

Hank stands up The nurse motions for Hank to come over to him
The nurse appears very somber

HANK
Yes

NURSE
Mr Sage your son wanted me to
tell you he’s going to take a cab
home

Hank looks taken aback at first but then smiles

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

A DOCTOR 60 wearing a white coat sits across from Phin A
scan of Phin’s brain is on a computer screen It is a very
similar situation to when Phin initially learned of the tumor

Phin is very pale and has bags under his eyes

DOCTOR
Your intracranial pressure is
extremely high

PHIN
And

DOCTOR
I’ve spoken with your physician I’m
sorry Mr Sage but we both agree
you don’t have much time left Wed
like you to stay at the hospital so we
can monitor you

Phin silently nods then slowly looks around the room taking it
all in He stands up shakes the doctor’s hand then leaves

EXT SAGE HOUSE - EVENING

The cab pulls up to the front of the house with Phin inside

INT SAGE HOUSE - DAY
Phin walks in the door with his bag looking to see if Terry or

Hank are in the living room They aren’t there Phin ascends
the stairs to his room

INT SAGE HOUSE - PHIN’S ROOM - DAY

Phin looking worse than ever enters to find Hank in his room
rummaging though his stuff

Hank is startled and defensive expecting a fight

HANK
I was cleaning

PHIN
Yeah

Phin doesn’t seem to have the energy to fight

HANK
What did the doctors say

PHIN
(sarcastically)
I’m cured
HANK

That’s not funny Phineas Did they
run anymore tests

PHIN
Yeah

HANK
And

PHIN

Theyll get back to me in a few days

Phin starts to take his coat off He looks exhausted He takes
out his wallet and sets it on the hockey game along with his
watch

HANK
So how is our contest going You
haven’t had your notebook out in a
while

PHIN
I’m keeping track in my head now

HANK
Do you think that’s the most reliable
place to store information at the

moment

PHIN
Ill write it down later Where’s
Terry

Hank nods toward the window Phin peers out to see Terry
training He is jogging in place while tossing a medicine ball
in the air He seems to have fully recovered from his fall

PHIN (CONTD)
Where did he get that medicine ball

Hank shrugs
Phin climbs under the hockey table and lays in bed

PHIN (CONTD)
Wake me up in an hour

HANK
It’s the middle of the day

PHIN
And I need some sleep

HANK
You just said you felt fine

PHIN
(perplexed)
No I didn’t Actually I feel like
dying right now so can you just leave
me alone for one hour

Hank opens his mouth to respond but comes up empty Phin’s
comment has landed heavy with him Phin closes his eyes and
rubs his eyelids as Hank leaves

Through the window in Phin’s room we see Hank storm out to
Terry take his medicine ball and try to throw it in anger It
doesn’t go very far Hank marches back into the house as Terry
stands looking confused

Phin sighs in pain off camera

Hank can be heard ascending the stairs

Phin’s door creaks open Hank walks over to a wall clock pulls
it off of the wall then sets the time forward an hour

Hank peers under the table to see Phin asleep He slams the
bedroom door

HANK
Hour’s up

Phin jolts up and hits his head on the hockey table

PHIN
Fuck What

HANK
You wanted me to wake you up in an
hour I just want to get this over
with

PHIN
I need a few more minutes then

HANK
You said an hour

PHIN
I know what I said

HANK
This isn’t a rest home

PHIN
This isn’t even a home

HANK
Well you could use some exercise

Hank shoves the hockey table away from the bed uncovering Phin
Phin slowly sits up and rises out of bed as Hank is already
walking out the door and

INT SAGE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

down the stairs first Phin follows gripping the banister
as he descends Hank watches from the bottom of the stairs

offering no help

Before Phin reaches the bottom Hank is already headed out back

EXT BACKYARD - DAY
Hank and Terry stand waiting as Phin slowly exits the back door

Phin sighs rubbing his temples His head clearly aches

TERRY
How you feeling

PHIN
Fantastic

Terry nods

TERRY
So what’s next

Before Phin can answer Hank chimes in

HANK
Were chopping down those trees

Hank points off across an empty field There are a few trees
about a quarter of a mile away

PHIN
No We’re not going out there

Hank ignores Phin and asks Terry

HANK
Saw or axe

PHIN
This isn’t your contest anymore

Hank ignores Phin and points over to the side of the house
There is a saw and an axe leaning against the house

Terry looks over at the tools then over at Phin Phin is
shaking his head Terry looks over to see Hank producing a very
similar glare but nodding Phin and Hank look very odd nodding
and shaking together at Terry

Terry thinks for a beat

TERRY
Axe

HANK
Good choice

Hank hands the axe to Terry and he picks up the saw for himself
He starts walking toward the trees Terry starts to walk but
notices Phin isn’t following

TERRY
(to Phin)
Come on I think I can win this one

Phin sees that Terry is genuinely excited

PHIN
Fine give me a hand

Terry starts to walk back to help Phin

HANK
No

Both Terry and Phin look to Hank

HANK (CONTD)
Don’t help him

PHIN
What

HANK
He doesn’t need your help He can do
this

Terry looks back at Phin evaluating the situation

After a beat of Terry not helping Phin starts to walk He is
walking a bit crooked and almost loses his balance Terry runs
to catch him but

HANK (CONT’D)
No Do not help him He’s not as bad
as he seems

Terry stops

PHIN
Then how bad am I Dad

Beat
HANK
I’ve seen people a lot worse off than

you We get the Discovery Channel

Phin looks furious He tries to walk toward Hank but he is
still having trouble

PHIN
Give me a hand

Terry walks to help him

HANK
I said do not help him

Terry considers for a moment then stops Phin glares at Terry
then back at Hank

Phin stops and takes a deep breath

PHIN
Dad You’re in the lead

Hank and Terry are both stunned Phin turns to Terry
PHIN (CONTD)
As horrible of a person he is it’s

worse that you can’t stand up to him

Phin turns and stumbles toward the house Terry runs over to try
and help him

HANK PHIN
Don’t help him Do not help me

Terry stops Hank takes a deep breath

PHIN (CONTD)
I’m fine

Phin braces himself against the house and takes a deep breath

INT SAGE HOUSE - NIGHT

Hank sits in the kitchen with Terry Hank is drinking coffee
They don’t say anything for a moment Then

TERRY
Is that decaf

Hank stands up and walks out and sits in the living room Hank
sets down his coffee and pours himself a glass of scotch He
takes out his pipe and lights it
He calls back to Terry still in the kitchen
HANK
Terry that dog you had what was its
name

Terry is suddenly alert

TERRY
Oh I I don’t remember

Hank takes a drink
HANK
Oh Do you think I was wrong to want

to put it to sleep

TERRY
Yes

HANK
What if it had actually been dying
Would I still have been wrong

Terry now stops to consider the situation

TERRY
Dying of what

HANK
I don’t know doggy plague

TERRY
How bad is it

HANK
It’s plague It can barely piss on
the things it used to like to piss on

Terry thinks for a second

TERRY
I guess I’d want her put to sleep
then I wouldn’t want to catch the
plague from her

HANK
(frustrated)
No You can’t catch dog plague
We’re just talking about the dog
Would you put it out of its misery

A look of horror sweeps Terrys face

TERRY
Is there something you’re trying to
say to me

HANK
(defensive)
No Of course not

TERRY
Sage

HANK
It’s nothing I don’t know I was
just asking

Terry slowly gets up from his chair We can hear him shuffling
through drawers Terry emerges in the hallway holding a tennis
ball and shaking his flashlight He looks very distressed

TERRY
I I’m just going I’m gonna take a
quick walk
Terry runs out the door

Hank takes another drink turns on the TV and sits for a moment
We can’t see what’s on TV
TV and walks into the kitchen and unplugs the toaster

Hank gets up without turning off the

INT SAGE HOUSE - PHIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Phin is laying under the hockey table back over his bed once

again Hank enters

Phin

HANK

PHIN

I don’t want to talk to you

HANK

You put the table back

PHIN

Got used to it

Ah

(beat)

HANK

Youre getting worse

PHIN
(sarcastically)
Really
HANK

Did you mean what you said today

PHIN

That you’re in the lead

HANK

No not that

Then what

PHIN

HANK

Never mind

(beat)
You want some food
downstairs and eat

PHIN
Not right now

You should go

HANK
I’m not bringing you food up here
Youll make a mess

PHIN
Probably

Hank obviously didn’t get the reaction he was hoping for

HANK
Terry wouldn’t make a mess He’s very
clean

PHIN

It’s next to godliness
HANK
I can’t believe you’re giving up
Phineas
Phin slides out from under the table
PHIN
This isn’t giving up This is being
beaten Sometimes we just lose
Hank thinks about this It hits him hard

Phin sits up

HANK
Where are you going

PHIN
You’re right I should get something
to eat while I can actually see
straight for a moment

Hank looks panicked for a second He blocks the door as Phin
stands up

HANK
No I’11 get you something

Phin looks confused

PHIN
No

Phin pushes past Hank out into

INT SAGE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

HANK
Phineas just wait

Hank steps into the hallway and grabs Phin by the shoulder just
before he gets to the stairs

PHIN
What are you doing

HANK
Nothing

Phin looks down at the stairs to see there is a piece of wire
tied at shin level across the top step It is a trip wire

Phin is baffled

PHIN
Is that wire

HANK
Oh yeah Watch out for that

Phin looks further down the stairs to see something very odd at
the bottom The floor is covered with baking trays filled with
water A plugged in toaster rests carefully balanced on the
edges of the pans in the very center

Phin is stunned

HANK (CONT’D)
Son

PHIN
(oddly calm)
Were you going to kill me

HANK
No of course not

PHIN
I was going to trip over this wire
fall down the stairs and land in that
toaster bath

HANK
I think Terry just left that stuff
down there I guess he’s not as clean
as I thought

PHIN
You knew you were winning and figured
why not end the game while you were
ahead It’s classic Dad

HANK
That’s ridiculous Phineas

PHIN
These are your last words to me You
could at least tell me the truth

Hank pauses for a long time contemplating whether he should
tell the truth or not

HANK
I couldn’t see you like this I
didn’t want you to see yourself like
this

Phin looks around the walls There are clean patches on the
walls where frames have recently been removed

PHIN
Is that where all the mirrors went

Hank nods

PHIN (CONTD)
Why didn’t you just shoot me then
Why all of this

HANK
I thought it would be exciting A hell
of a way to go

Phin just stares Hank gets very serious
HANK (CONTD)
It had to look like an accident for
the police

Phin can barely speak as he tears up Hank is also fighting
tears

PHIN
For everything you’ve done
Everything you’ve put me through

Phin can’t finish He walks over to the top of the stairs He
places his shin against the trip wire

HANK
Phineas stop

Phin pushes forward against the wire preparing to tumble down
the stairs The wire snaps

HANK (CONT’D)
Thank God

Hank walks over to grab Phin

PHIN
Stay there

Phin walks down the stairs to the water and toaster Phin
supports himself on the bannister the whole way down He
carefully steps into the water

HANK
Phineas You can’t--
(thinking)

You need to change your notes Terry
should be in the lead now

PHIN
I want you to have the money You
really deserve it Dad Besides you
know what they say about money

HANK
They who

PHIN
‘They’ they Never mind

Phin kicks the toaster into the water
Phin starts shaking violently
Hank shields his face and yells

Phin slowly stops shaking as he realizes he isn’t actually
electrocuted

Hank looks up at Phin
HANK
Phineas But you were being
electrocuted

Phin shrugs

PHIN
The toaster is broken

Hank nods with realization
HANK
I forgot about that
(beat)
But I must have known subconsciously

Phin doesn’t say anything He turns to head out the door

being

As

he turns he sees the TV in the living room is on Home Alone is

on TV He looks around at Hank’s trap

PHIN
You’re unbelievable
(beat)
I’m not coming back

Phin opens the door His shoulder hits the frame as he leaves
Just as Phin slams the door behind him Hank yells

HANK (CONT’D)
I was wrong I

It isn’t clear if Phin heard or not
Terry can be heard coming in the back door

Okay

Both Terri and Literal sit down

Phin is puzzled but shrugs it off
PHIN
Literal I need to tell you something

I’m going to die

PHIN
Really How

LITERAL
I thought it was pretty obvious

Literal looks Phin up and down
LITERAL (CONTD)

I don’t know

LITERAL
Does it hurt now

PHIN
Yeah a little

LITERAL
You should probably do something about
it

PHIN
My dad tried to

LITERAL
That was nice of him

This hits Phin hard He forces out a strained laugh through
knot in his throat

Literal puts his arm around Phin He puts his fingers up to
Phin’s neck to check his pulse

PHIN
I guess
(beat)
You want to sleep here tonight

LITERAL
It’s cold

PHIN
You can have the dog

Literal talks to the dog
LITERAL
You’re mine now I’m going to name
you Water
PHIN
No I meant you could sleep with the

dog to keep you warm

LITERAL
Oh Okay

PHIN
And that’s a bad name

LITERAL
Not really

Phin reaches over and turns off the TV He lies against the
wall as Literal and Terri try to share Terri’s dog bed

There is a long pause after everyone is settled down

PHIN
He tried to kill me My dad

LITERAL
Did it work

PHIN
LITERAL
Did he want it to
Phin thinks about it for a second

PHIN
I don’t think so

LITERAL
Hmm I wonder why he did it then

Literal closes his eyes to go off to sleep Phin lies awake

-- Phin and Literal sit in front of an almost-empty bowl of
melted ice-cream both looking incredibly ill

EXT ICE CREAM PARLOR - DAY

Phin and Literal sit on the curb outside both looking
dissatisfied and sick

PHIN
Is there anything else to do

Literal shakes his head He looks too sick to talk

PHIN (CONTD)
I hate this place

Literal pukes in the gutter

Phin stands up and walks down the street toward a liquor store

EXT TOWN STREET - DAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Phin is stumbling down the street with Literal Literal smacks
his lips as if his mouth tastes bad Phin now has the neck of
a bottle of scotch sticking out of a brown paper grocery bag
He takes a long drink

As they walk they reach the side of Beth’s diner Phin leans
flat against the diner as if being sneaky

PHIN
(loudly whispering)
Do you think Beth is working today

LITERAL
Yes

Phin peeks around the corner and into the diner window He sees
Beth taking orders His eyes start to well up

Phin blinks hard then pulls back from the window and looks down
the street He spots Beth’s car at the end of the block He
takes a swig

Phin makes his way to Beth’s car He picks up a small piece of
rock from the ground and starts to scratch the side of her car
The scratch doesn’t stand out much on the already weathered car

Literal stares unaffected sucking on a mint

PHIN
My dad keyed my first car

Phin sighs

PHIN (CONT’D)
Said it was to keep me modest

Phin sighs He can’t believe what he’s just done

Phin starts to scratch the car again This time he is scrawling
“SORRY” next to the scratch As Phin starts into the second
“R” he puts more weight on his hand supporting him against the
car He starts to blink hard His teeth clench

Phin falls to the curb leaving a long trail scratch down the
side of the car for the second “R”

Literal drops down to lift up Phin’s head

LITERAL
Do you need to go to the hospital

PHIN
I need to go home

Literal helps Phin to his feet While supporting Phin on his
shoulder Literal picks up the rock and finishes Phin’s scrawl
on the car Literal finishes it so it reads “SORRY”
PHIN (CONTD)
No no exclamation point I meant it
more with an ellipsis
Literal licks his thumb and tries to rub off the punctuation

PHIN (CONT’D)
It doesn’t matter

Phin lifts himself off Literal’s shoulder to stand on his own
PHIN (CONTD)

I need to get some things first
INT WALMART - DAY
Phin is at the counter ringing up a few things A clean blue
and white striped button down shirt a jacket and some black
pants hair bleach and some concealer makeup
INT LITERAL’S CAR - EVENING

Phin is already in his new clothes In the vanity mirror he is
applying the makeup under his eyes covering the bags

PHIN
Literal please don’t contradict
anything I say today

Literal nods

INT SAGE HOUSE - EVENING

Phin looking clean and healthy in his new clothes enters the
house through the front door Literal follows Terry is in the
kitchen trying to fix the toaster with a fork He turns around
to see Phin Terry is surprised

TERRY
Phin I thought you were gone

PHIN
Where’s Dad

TERRY
He’s been locked up in his room since
you left He said you got mad said
neither of us was winning anything
broke the toaster and left to go die
at sea

PHIN
Something like that
(beat)
I need to tell you both something

HANK (0S)
Phineas

Hank descends the stairs and walks into the kitchen

HANK (CONT’D)
Are you here to tell Terry what I did

PHIN
No I need to talk to you both

HANK
Then let’s have it We both deserve
it

PHIN

I spent the night in a hospital last
night A new doctor ran some tests

Phin takes a deep breath and forces a smile

PHIN (CONTD)

I’m not dying They were wrong I
just have a rare calcium buildup near
my brain It looks like a tumor but
it’s easily treatable with medication
I’ve already started taking it

Terry and Hank are both stunned Literal looks as if he is about
to contradict what Phin has just said but he stops Phin looks
over at Literal
LITERAL
I agree

Phin looks a little puzzled Literal smiles and nods at Phin

HANK

Are you sure Maybe you should get a

second opinion

PHIN

I’m fine Dad This once can you

just be happy for me
Hank smiles He nods
Terry stands up and gives Phin a hug

TERRY
That’s great news

HANK
Is the treatment expensive

PHIN
Yeah it’s expensive

HANK

Good I knew you could buy your way

out of this

Hank reaches out his hand to shake Phin’s
moment then shakes Hank’s hand

TERRY

Phin hesitates for a

Do you guys want to go play a round of

hockey to celebrate

HANK

No not now I’ve gotta run out for a

second

PHIN
Where do you have to go

HANK
Just out for a minute

PHIN
Can’t it wait

HANK

What does it matter You’ve got all

the time in the world now

PHIN
Dad

HANK
I’1l be right back

Hank rushes out the front door

PHIN
Can you believe him

LITERAL
Yes

Literal smiles and nods at Phin
TERRY
He probably went to get some champagne
or something so we can celebrate
Let’s go play some hockey

PHIN
What’s with you and the hockey

Terry shrugs Phin smiles and nods

PHIN (CONTD)
Yeah I guess it’s been a while

INT SAGE HOUSE - PHIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Literal is watching as Terry and Phin try to maneuver the little
plastic athletes around the table Phin misses the puck a lot
Phin supports himself on the table with his free hand

TERRY
So how long are you going to stay
around now that you’re better

PHIN
Not too long

Terry is a little hurt by Phin’s answer

TERRY
But you’ll come back more often

PHIN
Well see
Terry scores
LITERAL
Gooooaaaal
TERRY

Triple-deke Every time

Phin shrugs it off and drops the puck back at center ice

TERRY (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I didn’t help you yesterday

PHIN
I know

TERRY
Good
(beat)
This is fun

PHIN
Yeah it is

The front door is heard creaking open then slamming shut
The bedroom door opens and Hank enters smiling

HANK
Who’s winning

PHIN
We’re not keeping score

Hank looks at the electronic score-board Terry is winning 5-0

HANK
What’s he doing

TERRY
Ref
LITERAL
(pointing to a plastic
player)
Icing

Hank nods patronizingly

HANK
Boys can I talk to Phin alone for a
second

Terry and Literal both walk out of the room and into the
hallway From outside Phin hears

LITERAL (0S)
Hi Beth

Phin’s expression goes blank

HANK
I’m sorry I tried to kill you Son I
really did have second thoughts
(MORE )

HANK (CONTD)
Now I know that the second thoughts
are usually the right thoughts

PHIN
What did you tell her

HANK
Well I was gonna let you tell her
yourself but she wouldn’t come over

PHIN
She knows

HANK
She couldn’t be happier

Phin looks devastated

HANK (CONT’D)
What’s the matter

PHIN
Nothing It’s just this was a nice
thing to do Dad
He pats Phin on the shoulder and walks out Phin slowly follows
him into

INT SAGE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Phin enters the hallway to see Beth waiting for him She is
smiling through tears

BETH
Phin

PHIN
(quietly)
It’s good to see you Beth

She slowly walks over and wraps her arms around him

PHIN (CONT’D)
Let’s go for a walk

Beth lets go Her smiles fades a bit as she nods

EXT RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

Phin has his arm around Beth as they walk slowly Phin is both
supporting himself and being romantic Phin shakes Terry’s
flashlight with his free hand

PHIN
I’m still a bit wobbly

BETH
How long until youre better

PHIN
They didn’t say

BETH
Soon though

PHIN
Yeah

Phin stumbles suddenly Beth hooks her arm through his

BETH
So you’1ll head home then

PHIN
Yeah I guess so

BETH
Yeah

PHIN
I’1l come back and visit

BETH
Sure

Beth looks a bit sad

They arrive at Terry’s barn

INT RUN-DOWN BARN - NIGHT
Everything is dark except for Phin’s flashlight

BETH
Where are we

Phin’s flashlight goes dim In the dark we can hear Terri the
dog running toward them Beth screams and grabs onto Phin

PHIN
It’s okay

Beth cautiously calms down

BETH
Can you turn the light on

PHIN
You weren’t supposed to see this until
after I was gone

BETH
What

Phin shakes the flashlight and it turns on Terri is standing
in front of them except she looks different She has been
bleached white over most of her body She now has the markings
of a small panda bear

BETH (CONTD)
Oh She’s a little panda

Beth kneels down to pet her Terri runs over and starts licking
Beth

PHIN
Turns out real pandas are hard to get

Beth is still playing with Terri barely listening to what Phin
is saying She gives the dog a tight hug

BETH
I can’t believe you got me a dog and
made it look like a panda I love it
PHIN
You can’t keep the dog It’s my
brothers but

BETH
Oh It’s still sweet of you

Beth walks over to Phin and they sit down against a wall

PHIN
Beth

Beth looks up at Phin

PHIN (CONTD)

Beth I’m sorry again
BETH
What
PHIN
You weren’t supposed to be a part of
this
BETH

Part of what

Phin can’t answer She can see something is very wrong

BETH (CONTD)
Phin

Phin swallows deeply and forces himself to be strong

PHIN
I’m still dying Beth Soon

Beth is shocked

BETH
Yyou said you were going to visit

PHIN
I won’t be visiting I’m sorry

BETH
The doctors said--

Beth stops herself

PHIN
I’m not better I lied to my dad and
my brother I needed to be there at
home without everything hanging over
my head

Beth starts crying Phin tries to hold her She allows him for
a second but then pushes him away

BETH
You can’t do this to people

PHIN
You were never supposed to find out

Beth shouts through tears

BETH
But I did

PHIN
I’m so sorry

Beth pounds Phin in the chest with her fist He stumbles back
and slides down the wall

Beth slowly sits down on the ground next to Phin
BETH
I’m sorry I just can’t watch you

die I can’t

PHIN
You don’t have to

They sit huddled together in the dark The flashlight goes off
The darkness is broken with the door to the barn opening and
Beth’s silhouette seen leaving Phin is still sitting

INT SAGE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Phin slowly opens the front door and comes inside His new
shirt is dirty and his eyes look tired

Hank Terry and Literal are all waiting for him in the living
room Phin avoids eye contact

HANK
Phineas are you okay

PHIN
Yeah just got caught up in some dust
winds

TERRY

Where’s Beth

PHIN
She had to go back to work

Phin wipes his eye Hank notices the makeup under his eye smear
onto Phin’s sleeve but he doesn’t say anything

PHIN (CONTD)
Can I stay here tonight

LITERAL
Yes

Hank flashes Literal a confused glance but turns back to Phin
and nods

HANK
Yeah of course just don’t make a
mess

Hank eyes Phin hoping for a reaction but Phin just nods

PHIN
Good night guys

TERRY
See you tomorrow

Phin gives Terry a weak but genuine smile then heads upstairs

INT SAGE HOUSE - PHIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Phin is playing with the old camcorder Hank opens the door
Startled a bit Phin sets the camcorder down

HANK
Can I come in

PHIN
Sure

Hank fiddles with a few items sitting around A pen a stapler
As Phin stares waiting Hank sets them down

HANK
I just wanted to say I’m happy you’re
going to make it Phineas

PHIN
Is that all

HANK
Yeah

Phin nods and Hank reaches for the door knob

HANK (CONTD)
And even if you weren’t going to make
it I’d still be proud of you You
gave it a good fight

Hank lets go of the doorknob and gives Phin a hug At first Hank
awkwardly only puts one arm around Phin patting his back Hank
then puts the other around Phin no longer patting

PHIN
Thanks

HANK
You know I wasn’t ready to be a

father when I had you I was just a
kid

Hank is having a hard time speaking He lets go of Phin

Hank looks apologetic but doesn’t say anything He just shrugs

PHIN
Yeah

HANK
Good night

PHIN

Good night

INT SAGE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Hank closes Phin’s door and stands outside for a moment
From inside the room Hank faintly hears
PHIN (0S)

Hi everyone Well I guess its more

of a goodbye
Hank doesn’t listen He rubs his face and walks away from the
door

INT SAGE HOUSE - NIGHT

Hank is sitting on his recliner in the living room with a glass
of scotch The glow of the TV lights the room

Suddenly the front door creaks open Hank glances over to see
Beth walk in Her cheeks are covered in tears She doesn’t say
anything She just closes the door and walks upstairs
Hank goes back to watching TV

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT SAGE HOUSE - PHIN’S ROOM - DAY

Hank walks into the room The room is now clean and organized
Phin is still under the hockey table

Hank pulls the table back to reveal Phin laying peacefully
underneath Beth is holding him crying They are still in
their clothes from the day before

Hank sees a VHS tape on the dresser with the word “WILL” hand-
written on it

FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXT GRAVEYARD - DAY

Literal Terry Hank Beth an elderly PRIEST and a dozen or so
others including AJ all dressed in black stand around a
coffin being laid into the ground Terry is wearing his blue
and white scarf Hank is holding a picture of Phin’s mother

The hole in the ground is much wider than the coffin

PRIEST
The mourners shall be comforted The
hungry shall be filled The merciful
shall obtain mercy The pure of

heart shall see God And the meek
shall inherit the earth

AJ takes out a flask takes a drink then pours some on the
ground

The coffin is lowered Hank looks to the priest

HANK

Is that from the bible
PRIEST

Yes
HANK

Of course

Hank lowers his head for another moment then nods to cue the
lowering of the hockey table into the grave over the coffin

INT RECEPTION HALL - DAY

The people from the funeral mingle with drinks in their hands
The room is lined with vending machines filled with appetizers
There are buckets of quarters next to each machine

INT RECEPTION HALL - EVENING

Everyone has left except for Literal Terry Beth and Hank
(still holding the picture of Phin’s mother) They all stand
holding drinks A LAWYER 45 dressed in a black suit wheels a
TV into the room He pulls out a cassette and puts it into the
slot of a VCR sitting below the TV

LAWYER
This is Phineas Q Sage’s last living
will Are we ready

Hank nods The lawyer pushes the tape completely into the slot
It begins to play

On the TV is Phin sitting in his room The camera doesn’t cut
away from the TV

PHIN
Hi everyone Well I guess it’s
more of a goodbye

(MORE )

PHIN (CONTD)
By now you all probably hate me for
what I’ve done but in all fairness
most of you have done some horrible
things too Dad remember when you
broke Terry’s arm teaching him how to
arm wrestle And Terry I know you
still feel bad about drowning that
family of moles You meant well Now
those things don’t matter anymore and
I hope that someday this wont matter
either I didn’t want to die with you
all feeling sorry for me I just
wanted one good day

Phin looks away from the camera for a second before starting
back up

PHIN (CONTD)
I guess it’s on to the contest I am
splitting the money 90-10 Terry
you get 90 but you don’t have full
access to it until 15 years from now
I’m sorry Terry I just can’t give you
everything so easily You need to
make your own way You would never
have to do that if I laid it all out
for you The time constraint will be
broken if this brain tumor thing
happens to run in the family Knock
on wood

Phin knocks on the hockey table It isn’t wood

PHIN (CONTD)
I am going to start you on the right
path though The barn you go to is
now yours I am not giving it to you
either You earned it According to
state law you’ve been squatting there
long enough so that it is now legally
yours I’ve filed the paperwork and
had it setup for electricity and
plumbing

Phin pauses for a moment composing himself

PHIN (CONTD)
Dad you get 10 It’s more than
enough for you to get by but you
didn’t win the competition Even
though you lost I’m proud of you
You gave it a good fight

Phin takes in a deep breath and releases it

PHIN (CONTD)
Literal I want you to have all of my
literal stuff Any non-liquid assets
go to you My clothes my cars my
apartment If it meant enough to me to
keep it around it’s now yours
Finally I’ve purchased the diner in
Terry’s name and I’m having it
converted to an entirely automated
restaurant Like a giant vending
machine but it needs you to manage
it Terry And if Beth shows up to
the funeral could you tell her that
while this is putting her out of a
job it wasn’t meant to be cruel
Think of it more as a gentle shove in
a new direction There is a position
waiting for her at my company She’1l
have to move to Los Angeles but it’s
there if she wants it Also tell her
she should teach kids how to take the
candy off of the bottom row It’s
just candy

(long beat)

If she doesn’t show up for the
funeral please don’t tell me the
next time you see me I guess that’s
it

Phin has a quick flash of a headache and gets distracted for a
moment forgetting to turn off the camcorder Phin starts
cleaning up his room

As we here the shuffling of Phin on tape we see shots of the
town

- The Sage home glowing in the sun

- The water tower still painted to look like “phin hearts
cock”

- Terry’s barn being fitted with lights
- The charred remains of atlas holding the golf ball
- Beth’s diner outside Workers are going in and out

- Inside of the diner machines are being fitted with conveyer
belts running back to the kitchen from each of the tables

We finally cut back to the reception hall to see everyone still
staring straight forward at the video watery-eyed Terry is
trying to force a smile Beth is trying her best to hold back
the tears Literal is staring blankly and Hank is sitting cross-
legged on the ground with the picture in his lap

The video is still running It’s just Phin cleaning up his
room

Literal turns to Beth
LITERAL
Will you come visit me at my new
apartment
Beth is too choked up to talk She hugs Literal

Terry sits down next to Hank

HANK
Do you know why I always favored you

TERRY
Because you were competing with Phin
through me

HANK
Oh I guess that makes sense

Hank looks at the picture

HANK (CONTD)
Your mother loved him more than

anything

TERRY
Sage--

HANK
Dad

TERRY

Dad I need to tell you something
Terri is still alive

HANK
I know you are son

TERRY
No my dog Terri

HANK
I knew that too

TERRY
I don’t want you to put her to sleep

HANK
I wont

Terry puts his arm around Hank

Phin notices the camera is still recording He looks back into
the camera again Everyone watches

PHIN
Also I have one last request I’d
like to be cremated
There is a knock on Phin’s door
Phin looks back then turns the camera off The TV goes black

Everyone keeps staring at the TV in awkward silence

HANK
It’s okay We’1l burn an effigy

FADE OUT

THE END
