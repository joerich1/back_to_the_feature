1 A dusty deserted street - saloon livery stable sunset
Only there is something unsettling about it all The colors
are too muted and the angles not quite in perspective Pulling
slowly back eventually reveals the edges of a narrow wooden
picture frame

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Drifting away from the painting and slowly across a room
Across Venetian blinds open letting in moonlight across
intricate handmade wooden models dime novels and comic books
across the arm of a metronome gently slapping back and forth
and settling finally on a small hand writing slowly and
deliberately over and over in synchronization it seems to
the rhythm of the metronome the word LEONARD

2 INT DINING ROOM - MORNING - 1930

The pendulum of a clock An adult hand placing a bowl of
cereal on a table Leonard ten or eleven waits a moment for
the adult to leave grasps his spoon and manipulates it from
bowl to mouth in time with the soft regular rhythm of the
clock

3 EXT STREET - NEW YORK - MORNING - 1930 3
Schoolbooks slung over their shoulders Leonard and another boy

his age a classmate move along a street

All around them are visual rhythms - lines in the sidewalk

the even placement of trees the sunlight breaking through the
branches above them - and somewhere unseen the rhythmic

pounding of an elevator train

As they climb a fence a pocket watch Leonards falls to the
ground

4 INT CLASSROOM - DAY - 1930

An adult hand chalking the words of a poem on a blackboard
Children at desks dutifully transcribing the lesson

All but one Leonard Whose hands are trembling slightly and
whose paper is blank There is a noticeable lack of rhythms

A cold silence The broken watch rests on his desk

The boy from the train glancing at Leonard begins gently
tapping the end of his pen against his desk Leonard guided
by the cadence of his friends tapping begins to write

(o The teachers hand at the blackboard hesitates Distracted by

the rhythmic noise he traces it to the offender and silences
him with a loo
’

ithout the rhythm and without apparently inner natural
hythms to replace it Leonards hand begins dragging the pen
cross the paper forming vague scrawl each word less defined
han the last until they begin melding together into what
esembles nothing so much as a childs rendering of ocean
aves

he teacher resumes chalking on the board The boy from the
rain begins tapping his pen again and guided again by the
hythm Leonard is able to give definition to the ocean
aves to form recognizable lettersand words

he teacher hesitates again and glares at the boy making the
irritating noise The boy stops tapping and Leonards writing
again becomes formless

Sen tHebKtoHS

5 INT CLASSROOM- LATER - DAY - 1930
The finished poem on the blackboard The sounds of children at
play on the schoolyard The teacher alone in the classroom

fe) at his desk grading the penmanship lesson
He circles offending errors on the last page of the last
composition book He scribbles a grade opposite the students
name in a grade book He notices the absence of a grade in
Leonards column

Leonards desk The teacher locates the missing composition
book buried under textbooks He takes it back to his own desk
opens it and stares curiously at the last lesson the poem or
rather Leonards illegible representation of it

He considers earlier lessons in the book He begins to see in
the script a pattern of deterioration He reaches the last
entry again and stares at the few recognizable words drowning
In the waves

6 INT LEONARDS BEDROOM - DAY - 1930 - WINTER
The painting on the wall The intricate wooden models and dime
novels The Venetian blinds closed shutting out sunlight
Voices barely audible from somewhere else in the house
BOYS VOICE
When can I see him
WOMANS VOICE
When hes well
REV121589 (GREEN) Pg3
6CONT BOYS VOICE 6CONT

When will he be well

After a moment --
WOMANS VOICE

I dont know
-- and the sound of a door closing
A small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds
revealing the snow-patched street below Leonards friend
crossing it glances back then disappears around a corner
And the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down
extinguishing the single ray of light

FADE TO BLACK

Tight on the face of a man (SAYER) late thirties glasses

7 INT ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY
He seems uncomfortable Perhaps its the suit Or the place
Or the situation Or the hard straight-backed chair hes in
When he does finally speak its with great sincerity --
SAYER
When you say people you mean
living people
Behind an old oak desk the hospitals Director glances over
to its Chief of Medicine Dr Kaufman with a look that seems
to wonder As opposed to what
DIRECTOR
Living people yes Patients

REV121589 (GREEN) Pg4

7CONT 7
Theres some mistake And Sayers chair begins to feel more
uncomfortable He tries to clear up the confusion -

SAYER
Im here for the research

position in your neurology

lab
DIRECTOR
Neurology lab
He doesnt laugh at Sayer just at the thought of it
DIRECTOR
We have an x-ray room
Sayer tries to share the Directors amusement with a good-
natured smile but doesnt really understand it Kaufman seems
to have less time for this and in plain English unadorned -
KAUFMAN
- The-position-ds-Staff-“Neurologist
Sayer looks like a man whos just learned that everything he
knows about the world is wrong £

The Director refers to stapled sheets of paper in his hands
Sayers resume
DIRECTOR

about that anything with patients

The Director isnt sure he heard right
DIRECTOR
Sorry

SAYER

I was on it for five years

I was the only one who really

believed in it The rest of them

said it couldnt be done t

KAUFMAN
It cant
SAYER
Well I know that now I proved
it
The director offers a slow tentative nod before consulting the
resume again
DIRECTOR
Maybe before At Saint Thomas
(Sayer is already
shaking his head no)
All research Earth -
SAYER
Pigs brains they-re quite
similar to human brains
DIRECTOR
(hopefully)
Are they
SAYER
Oh yes three years
As the Director retreats back to the resume hoping against
hope of finding in it something germane Sayer glances away to
a window He wishes he were outside it He has no business
being here He should leave
SAYER
Excuse me I made a mistake coming
here Clearly youre looking for
someone with more of a clinical
background
He stands up to leave Kaufman stands to see him out But

director keeps searching the resume

Ive taken enough of your time
You must have a hundred applicants
more suitable
KAUFMAN
Thanks anyway
DIRECTOR
Back in medical school
Kaufman shoots the Director a look that says No were not
that desperate
DIRECTOR
I mean you couldnt have
graduated without some clinical
experience
Sayer hesitates And eventually manages sort of a shrug and a
nod v

DIRECTOR
Well there we are doctor
Kaufman cant believe it but is sent back a look that says
We have no choice The Director gets up out of his chair and
smiling broadly extends his hand to Sayer Which unsettles
Sayer Which in turn unsettles the Director

DIRECTOR
(not far from Vv
begging)
You do want the job dont you

Sayer isnt so sure He thinks about it long and hard

A woman in a wheelchair uttering high-pitched screams (FEMALE
PATIENT 2 ) Sayer in a lab coat trying to calm her

REV121589 (GREEN) Pg7

10CONT SAYER 10
Theyre just pencils pens
He tries to prove it to her by removing one of them from the
pocket of his white coat Screaming louder at the sight of it
she tries to protect her face with her hands like a boxer being
beaten senseless

11 INT DAYROOM (B) - DAY 11
A man in his sixties confronts Sayer with an announcement in a
loud commanding voice -

12 INT DAYROOM (C) - DAY 12
Stepping around a wheelchair Sayer finds in it an elderly
woman nicely dressed her hair done-up a ribbon in it
Glancing at the chart in his hand -
SAYER
Mrs Cohen
MRS COHEN
He-s here
She smiles glances around Sayer hesitates uncertain who she
means

SAYER
Im here
(pause)
To examine you
MRS COHEN

Oh no I m leaving today My
sons coming to take me home

(6 Confused Sayer tries to find a discharge form among the papers
on the clipboard Unsuccessful he excuses himself from her
and crosses the room to a nurse

SAYER
Excuse me Mrs Cohens son
Hes coming today
NURSE 1
I wouldnt bet on it he hasnt
for twenty years
The nurse turns away Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs Cohen
trying to find the words to tell her He doesnt have to his
discomfort does it Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the
ribbon from her hair
13 OMITTED
14 INT EXAMINATION ROOMOFFICE- LATER - DAY
Silence Institutional beige walls Glass cabinets locked
containing medical instruments A metal examination table with
leather straps
Sayer alone at one of three old desks in the large room still
unsettled from the experience with Mrs Cohen Eventually he
gets up crosses to a window and tries to open it
Its jammed shut painted shut perhaps but finally gives way
sliding up He lets the air from outside wash over his face as
he stares out absently at children on an elementary school
playground beyond a debris-strewn field
MISS COSTELLO OS
(a matter of fact)
It gets easier
Sayer turns to the voice to Miss Costello the hospitals head
nurse a veteran of this place a woman who has seen it all
Shes standing in the doorway
MISS COSTELLO
You dont think it will but it
does
A moment and she A urns and leaves

14a EXT TENEMENT (LUCYS) - ESTABLISH - DAY

15 INT TENEMENT - NEW YORK- DAY

The needle of a Victrola clawing at the endless music-less
inner bands of a 78

Cold eggs and toast and prescription medicine on a kitchenette
table A puddle of coffee on the floor Ceramic shards a
broken cup
An old woman on her knees eyes closed arms tangled in an
aluminum walker limp and stiff at once somehow like the limbs
of a discarded marionette Beyond her beyond a threshold a
shuttered living room Furniture from another era and the
clutter of a lifetime
A shadowy figure in a wicker wheelchair near the Victrola
Another old woman with spindly limbs profoundly afflicted and
preposterously still The back of her head is flat and bald
the result of lying supine upon it for much of several decades
On her passive face rest round wire-rim glasses Insane or
retarded and unaware of the dead woman she mumbles just
barely audibly a melody
SAYERS VOICE
Can you hear me

16 INT EXAMINATION ROOMOFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY
Distant music of childrens laughter Perhaps real emanating
from outside perhaps imagined remembered playing in a remote
region of the womans damaged mind Arrested of all movement
she stares transfixed at the blades of a fan
SAYERS VOICE
Do you know where you are
(nothing back)
Do you remember being brought
here
(nothing back)

Do you know what has happened
If she does she gives no indication No word or gesture No
change of expression on her mask of a face She is elsewhere
(or nowhere) cut adrift by her illness living in a private
world (or hell)

SAYERS VOICE

Can you hear me
Sayer wearing a white lab coat tries to read her eyes
Behind thick lenses uncleaned for weeks or months the eyes
are inscrutable

REV 12589 (BLUE)

16CONT

Sayer reaches to her face and carefully pulls the glasses from
it He cleans them with a flap of his lab coat -- they are

loose bent out of shape-- and gently slides the temples back
over her ears
He turns away from her and types at a manual Underwood The
form in the machine at the top reads -- BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL
ADMISSIONS CONSULTATION REQUEST NEUROLOGY Sayer types in
a lower section headed -- FINDINGS DIAGNOSIS
He turns back in his chair to find the woman doubled-over in
her wheelchair one arm very close to the floor the hand
clutching the glasses She is not moving but she has moved
That or she is dead
Sayer rights her takes the glasses from her hand and slips
them back onto her face He studies her for a moment and for
that moment remains as still as entranced as her
He takes the glasses from her face again and sets them on the
floor He waits She doesnt retrieve them He picks them up
and holds them out to her She doesnt move to take them He
lets go of them and she lunges forward catching them the
instant before they hit the floor Sayer just stares
SAYER«S VOICE
Her name is Lucy Fishman

16B INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EXAMINATION ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
Dr Kaufman the hospitals Chief of Medicine notices a number

Pg-

16B
of patients lined up in their wheelchairs as he passes them on
his way into Sayers examination room -
SAYERS VOICE
She was found by neighbors with

her sister several days after the
sister had died

17 INT EXAMINATION ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

The same room as before The same woman All that has changed
is the light Its late afternoon
SAYER (CONTD)

According to the neighbors

shes never set foot outside her

apartment has no other living

relatives and has always been the

way she is now - without any

comprehension or response

Kaufman tries to feign interest He glances to the others

Sayer has summoned to the room -- two other doctors Tyler and
Sullivan and Miss Costello
SAYER
And yet

Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at
her Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it
And stays there stiff still
Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufmans face is that
of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card
tricks Dismissing the phenomenon ---
DR KAUFMAN
A reflex
SAYER
If she batted it away I might call
that a reflex She doesnt bat it
away she catches it
DR KAUFMAN
- Its still a reflex
ol Lomo
SAYER
Im sorry if you were right Id
agree with you
Kaufman understandably takes some offense at the comment
Sayer however is unaware that he has caused any
SAYER
Its as if having lost all
will of her own on which to act
she borrows the will of the ball
Awkward silence Eventually--
DR TYLER
The will of the ball

Sayer nods Kaufman and the other doctors concur with glances
that the theory and theorist are absurd
DR SULLIVAN
Excuse me
Sullivan has better things to do and leaves the room So does
Tyler Kaufman and Miss Costello remain

DR KAUFMAN

(hopefully)
Youre trying to make a good
impression Thats it isnt it
Youre still settling in
Sayer isnt sure if he should agree or not He does
neither
DR KAUFMAN
Miss Costello youll see that Dr
Savers patients waiting out there
are rescheduled for tomorrow
MISS COSTELLO
Yes sir
DR KAUFMAN
Good night
Sayer watches Kaufman leave So does Miss Costello Lucy
looking less like a woman than a Diane Arbus photograph of
one

() Its unclear whether he knows what shes referring to

MISS COSTELLO
And that Ill look after things
for you until youve settled in
Good night doctor
She leaves He stares blankly out after her then at his
dashboard To it eventually quietly --
SAYER
Thank you
He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away
toward her car To the reflection --
SAYER
Thank you very much

at him

Sayer nods in agreement though he is not altogether as certain
of tne claim They are in a ward crowded with many patients
who are mad obviously and irretrievably so
SAYER
What did the voice say
SIDNEY
Mr Titch get your coat and hat
go up to the roof and jump off
SAYER
Did you recognize it as belonging
to a person Or was it just a
voice
Sidney considers Sayer suspiciously then smiles slyly

SIDNEY
You dont deny it was you

SAYER

Sayer is taken aback As is Sidney One of them and Sidney
believes he knows which is lying or crazy
SAYER
I do deny it It wasnt me
It wasnt real

Sidney suddenly completely disoriented withdraws

Sidney turns to a patient an elderly woman in a wheelchair

soup into her mouth careful not to spill any that Sayer
notices her

26 INT LEONARDS DAYROOM - LATER - DAY

Another dayroom crowded with patients one of which stands
before a table absolutely motionless on thin bird-like legs
It is Lucy the one who caughtthe tennis ball The movement
of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness
Sayer considers her from all angles as one considers an
abstract art piece that baff les but in trigues Unlike
the
others shes on her feet A nd unlike the others she
seems
to Sayer to have been headed somewhere before turning
to stone
again
- »
He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain
across the room And that its the table like a barrier that
has arrested her progress He moves the table
In what appears to be slow motion she takes a tiny step And
another And another before encountering and being blocked
by an empty wheelchair She stops
Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her
path She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the
fountain before mysteriously stopping again
Sayer studies the puzzle there are no longer any barriers
in her way but shes not moving Defeated he goes to the
fountain himself fills a paper cup and takes it to her
Across the room a man in a wheelchair another ghost
(LEONARD) stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive
At Sayer

He tries to follow the trajectory of anothers gaze It leads

only to blank space
He considers another who appears deeply involved in some
minute and curious activity with his twisted hands a kind of
tearing shredding motion

he unwilling to fail

He isnt really asking her to answer which is fine with her

since she doubts equally both hypotheses
SAYER
Could he be saying I cant draw

Points her in the direction of the drinking fountain

She begins to move To step slowly over each tile She
reaches the bridge and hesitates

Then crosses it

burying his emotions behind a professional mask instead and
watches as Lucy delivered to the other side free now lets
the regularity of the pattern guide her toward the fountain

She nears it She is almost there

Then she is there But

doesnt drink Doesnt stop She continues past it

To a window the window bevond the drinking fountain which
Sayer hadnt noticed before had no reason to notice had no
need to notice with a broken pane allowing a view to the

outside

She stares out at the traffic below in hopes no doubt of

figuring out where she is

shift from her to Miss Costello

and then to Leonard in whose

mask of a face Sayer thinks he sees a faint glimmer

In a far corner of the darkened ward in a pool of lamp light
two silhouetted figures Sayer and Leonard Sleeping patients
all around them
Sayer carefully awkwardly places his hand on Leonards
After a moment the contact brings the useless appendage to
life As it slowly turns over and grasps the doctors hand a
glimmer of life seems to appear in Leonards eyes as well
Sayer unfamiliar it seems with the feeling the contact
produces in him nonetheless places his other hand on Leonards
other Soon it too turns and holds onto Sayers
The doctor draws both of Leonards hands toward him and sets
them down on the pointer of an Ouija Board
SAYER
Ill begin moving the pointer
toward the L For Leonard
Once I feel you beginning to move
it Ill stop and youll take
over Do you understand

Leonard of course cannot say whether he does or not The
look on his face is thoughtful The look on Sayers hopeful
and foolish

SAYER
Im beginning
The pointer begins to slowly move past stars and moons
Judging from Sayers expression he begins to feel Leonards
movement of it and presumably stops his own
SAYER
Yes good
The pointer moves across the letters but passes the L
without stopping It stops on the R
SAYER
No No I didnt make myself
clear My fault I
The pointer begins moving again interrupting Sayer It
passes the L again reaches the I and stops

SAYER

No No I
REV 101389
But the pointer is moving again It stops on the L
SAYER

Yes Yes Thats what I meant
L Good Now the E
It begins moving again But not to the E To the nK where
it hesitates briefly before moving again

himself)

wandering around the crowded room with a glass of wine He
approaches its hub of activity the neurochemist surrounded by
several impressed colleagues but cant manage to get close
enough to speak with him

76 INT MENS ROOM AUDITORIUM - LATER - AFTERNOON

The neurochemist walks in and crosses to the urinals A moment
later he hears the door opening and footsteps and then
nothing until --

SAYER OS
Do you think its possible that
simple Parkinsonian tremor taken
to its furthest extreme could

appear as no tremor at all
When no one answers the chemist glances over his shoulder
Sayer is there quite alone looking at him
NEUROCHEMIST
Are you speaking to me
Sayer is And really wants to know the answer The chemist
zips up and moves to the sinks to wash his hands
SAYER
If jail the compulsions in the
Parkinsons patient were somehow

accelerated -
(demonstrating what
he means)
- the hands the shaking the
tics the head bobbing the
quickening speech -
(hes become a mass »
of tics and
accelerated speech)
- might they not cave in on
themselves and in effect turn
the person into stone
He comes to a abrupt stop his eyes transfixed like a post-
encephalitics staring The chemist slowly dries his hands
with a paper towel
NEUROCHEMIST
Dr Sayer yes

Im a chemist doctor I leave it
to you guys to do the damage

journals and newspapers which Sayer gave him to read - and

People with ordinary Parkinsons
Disease sometimes complain that
theyve lost their grace
(he picks up a cup
with a shaking hand)
They have to think about the
things we just do
(with great trouble
he sets it down)
It has to do with a chemical in
the midbrain or rather the lack
of it called dopamine L-Dopa
replenishes this dopamine making
it possible for these patients
to move more naturally

Tight on Sayer framed in a doorway as still and silent and
entranced as a post-encephalitic

His perspective of the dayroom -- deserted except for a figure
a patient Leonard hunched over the table

As Sayer crosses toward him Leonards head slowly rises

Sayer sits opposite him and they consider each other in silence
for several moments

Leonard struggles to speak to form words They come out in a
halting cadence flat without inflection and are only barely
recognizable as words

significant that is Sayer gestures at the piece of paper

Sayer shrugs disappears into the kitchen a moment before
peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now a small

framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn
expression posed in front of a curtain the boat obviously a
photography studio prop

glances back in around the door frame at Leonard who has moved
over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are
neatly arranged

SAYER
Each has a specific purpose

Dickensian as I remember it - when
I happened to come across the
periodic table of elements
(smiles at the
thought)
I memorized it Which I admit was
a rather precocious thing fora
seven year old to do And I
remember feeling not so much a
sense of accomplishment as
comfort The halogens were what
they were The alkali metals were
what they were Each element had
its place and nothing could

change that They were secure no

Leonard nods perhaps more out of politeness than

understanding Sayer nods too feeling perhaps a little

exposed

LEONARD

Youre not married
It seems to Sayer a non sequitor

SAYER

available motion in the neck
no voluntary movement in the

Isolated circumstances -- the

mention of his name notes of

particular pieces of music the

touch of another human being --

managed on occasion to briefly

summon him but these awakenings

were rare and transient lasting

only a moment or two
Sayer glances to Miss Costello She nods Good thats
better

SAYER

The rest of the time he remained

in a profoundly eventless place

deprived of all sense of history

and happening and self --

encysted cocooned enveloped in

this metaphorical if not

physiological equivalent of sleep

or death
Tight on the screen on Leonard as he was Looking more like
a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one
SAYER

This was his condition when first

seen by me in a remote bay of this

hospital And the quality of his

life for the last 30 years

They move along a silent corridor that seems to stretch out
forever -- the doctor the two nurses -- carrying themselves
professionally with sobriety and restraint But as they near
the ward as theyre joined by others other nurses orderlies
their steps and hearts quicken They break into a trot

122 INT LEONARDS WARD - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

They appear at the threshold Sayer Miss Costello the night
nurse the others and peer into the darkened room

In the quiet in the shadows in the moonlight filtering in
through the windows the post-encephalitics are emerging from
their cocoons rising from the dead like Lazarus from the
earth reborn

Moving slowly past the beds A figure rediscovering the
feeling of her skin another the sound of his breath another
the beating of her heart

A figure still asleep wakes And for the first time in
nearly half a century sees herself in the world

Tight on Sayer on the look of awe on his face as he stares at
the scene going on in the darkened ward His glance finds
Leonard who is sitting up in his bed smiling

been away for quite some time
Tight on Sayer- alone in the darkened room watching the

Light moves across the screen Someone has entered Miss
Costello She exchanges a long glance with Sayer before they
both look back to the screen

Silence except for the sound of the projector Then -
SAYERS VOICE (FILM)
When did you realize it wasnt
Leonard thinks back trying to recall the exact moment he
realized he was aliven Finally --
LEONARD (FILM)
When I spoke and you understood
me
One tear snakes down Savers cheek The film cuts to silent
footage of Leonard soon after his awakening combing his hair
and delighting in the fact that he cjan comb it
Quietly without looking at Miss Costello --
SAYER
You told him I was a kind man
(long pause)
Its kind to give life only to
take it away
There is self-loathing in his voice On the screen Leonards
trying to operate an electric shaver that seems alive
MISS COSTELLO
Its given and taken away from
all of us
On screen Leonard buttons buttons on his shirt and glances up
smiling proud Tight on sayer in the dark room the projector
light flickering behind him More to himself --
SAYER
Why doesnt that comfort me

MISS COSTELLO
(quietly)
Because you are kind
(pause)
And because hes your friend
On screen Leonard is beckoning to someone unseen No one
appears but he keeps beckoning Finally Sayer embarrassed and
camera shy appears Though there is no sound it is clear he
asks What Leonard turns the doctor so that he is facing
the camera and points Sayer again asks What There
Leonard says Where Sayer demands Finally Sayer
looks directly curiously into the camera

basement apartment fumbling with keys

A Christmas tree too large for the doorway of an another
apartment across the street being tugged at by someone inside
unseen

make him look insane He passes a shop window with very simple
ornamentation as the proprietor inside switches out the lights
