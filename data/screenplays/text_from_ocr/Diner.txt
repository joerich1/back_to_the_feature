MUSIC Then we read

BALTIMORE

FADE OUT
FADE IN
INT DANCE HALL BASEMENT - NIGHT

FENWICK walks along the dimly lit basement Heavy wiatei
coats hang from hooks on the wall In the bg there

is constant traffic of pecple coming and going from the
rest rooms From above we hear the MUFFLED SOtJV OF THE

ROCK AND ROLL BAND

Fenwick is in his early 20s and dressed in the JOE
COLLEGE style of the late fifties Sports jacket button-
down shirt chino pants and Bass weejuns We sense

that he is a little lost in himself confused He looks

out one of the windows that views the parking lot Then
without any outward anger he punches his fist through a
window pane Seconds later he breaks another window with
his fist

Fenwick picking up the music beat from above struts to

the sound as he approaches another bank of windows He
calmly breaks another window pane with his fist

A GUY coming out of the bathroom in the bg sees Fenwicks
actions and then heads up the steps

CUT TO
INT DANCE HALL - NIGHT

The crowd is gathered around the bandstand listening to
the local group the SH K RS playing their popular hit
HOT NUTS The song is played toward the end of the even-
ing because of its risque Lyrics

BAND LEADER
Hot nuts hot nuts get from
the peanut man

BAND LEADER (CONT D)

Hot nuts hot nuts get em any -
way you can

As the crowd swings the verse back to the Band Leader
The Guy who spotted Fenwick breaking windows approaches
BOOGIE Boogie is something of a Dandy flashiar

in dress than others in his crowd Although he isnt
particularly good looking there is something about his
attitude that is very appealing to girls Boogie

aster hearing the Guy heads downstairs
