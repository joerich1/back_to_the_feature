stares bewildered by the bizarre movement beneath
Stace’s shirt near her spine

EMMA (0S) (CONTD)

But we hear the horror in her voice as she sets the
camera down and LIFTS STACE’S BLOUSE

EMMA (CONTD)
Oh God

Something CLAWS ITS WAY OUT OF STACE’S BACK Blood-slick
and somehow aware INKY BLACK TENTACLES EMERGE and wrap
around Stace’s waist The HEAD OF A BULBOUS JELLYFISH-

awkward angle The PESTE’S TENTACLES HAVE MULTIPLIED
THICKENED Partially obscuring the host’s face and body
Forming strange HUMPS all over his wasted form

recognizable as human His spine is impossibly twisted
Bent Broken The parasite covers every square inch of
skin A TENTACLE has penetrated the Host’s mouth
pulling it wide giving him a gruesome toothy LEER

Nono please

She tries to PRY THE TENTACLES OFF but they merely
squirm and return Inextricably linked to her

She GAGS into the toilet Pukes

Then she tries to remove the tentacles again This time
she wraps her hands around them and begins to PULL
SAVAGELY Straining hard SCREAMING IN PAIN CRYING
BODY TWISTING IN AGONY This shit hurts

Barely even aware of it she KICKS THE CAMERA into the
bedroom where it continues to record

And yet the Peste remains Undeterred As much a part
of her as it ever was Exhausted and beaten Stace gives
up The tentacles return to comfortably wrap around her
waist

Stace begins to weep then Wretched Miserable Awful
Unable to stand - her legs are too weak - she scrabbles
towards the door Breath hitching

looks like Michael might embrace her but--

at an I Love Lucy marathon on mute She looks awful
Listless Wasting away Of no use to anyone Smoking

QUARANTINE DAY 38 A rainy miserable mess outside

Michael drives along leaning forward Focused hard on
the road The radio BLARES but it’s mostly STATIC

Emma swivels the camera around RECORDING OUT THE
WINDOW Very few civilian cars on the road Most are
either abandoned or looted The storefronts are dark
Deserted Ransacked They pull up to a--

CHECKPOINT

A string of orange TRAFFIC CONES across the road A few
MILITARY GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR patrol the area One
waves Michael to a stop and approaches the car

Michael rolls his window down

GUARD 1
Where do you think you’re going

MICHAEL

supplies I thought we were gonna
be okay but--

Emma notices something strange in front of her Hard to
see through the driving rain She switches on the
windshield wipers and a WOMAN (40s) materializes Slowly
approaching the checkpoint Barefoot Red housedress
Arms outstretched Distraught

action Assault rifles aimed and ready

your hands in the air

Michael hastily obeys Outside the woman raises her
hands but continues to approach The redness on her
dress BEGINS TO RUN Not a red housedress at all Just
COVERED IN BLOOD

WOMAN

it but I couldn’t It made me
I couldn’t stop it

GUARD 1

How far out is Stace

EMMA
Two weeks since it popped out

ORELIA
And you can control her

Michael clears away everyone’s plates Can’t answer her
on that one Still too painful

MICHAEL
(to Orelia)
There’s a sleeper in the study
Youre welcome to it

He points to Emma’s candy bar

MICHAEL (CONTD)
You’re not eating that

Chocolate’s harder to find these
days than gas and water

EMMA
It’s for Stace

Wordlessly Michael exits A moment

ORELIA
How’s he doing kiddo

A long moment
EMMA
I think we’ve been through the
worst of it

ORELIA

live in the Cole houseWell her

EMMA (CONTD)
Afterward I started having all
these weird dreams about someone
picking my nose while I was
sleeping I found out later that
it was Stace She was coming into
my room every night sticking her
finger under my nose to make sure
I was still breathing That’s my
sister That’s Stace

MICHAEL (0S)

EMMA

She turns the camera to the window and whistles as she
exits

THROUGH THE BLINDS WE SEE -- THE CDC VEHICLE Michael
waits anxiously by driver’s side door Stace
presumably is in the back cab Emma hurries outside and
hops into the passenger seat

A moment later Michael pulls out On her bike Orelia
follows after And they all disappear around the corner
