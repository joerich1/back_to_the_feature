THE FOG

FADE IN
ON AN OLD STONE LIGHTHOUSE

Standing sentry on a rocky bluff high above the POUNDING
SURF

And as we GET CLOSER we see A MAN STANDING IN THE WINDOW
staring out at the vast sea with troubled eyes

INT THE LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

Inside the small glass-enclosed room the MAN sets a pen and
ink on a writing table He opens a leather-bound book the
cover of which reads

JOURNAL OF PATRICK MALONE
He inks the pen and begins to write

MALONE (V0)
April 21st 1905 The die is
cast

ON A STRETCH OF WHITE SAND BEACH - NIGHT

TWELVE MEN stand in a line Some hold kerosene lamps All
are dressed in black like their mood

MALONE (VO)
A vote has been taken and our
decision made I have volunteered
to carry-out the deed much to the
dismay of my Erica and the
children

MALONE moves down the line of men The last of them hands
him an official-looking PARCHMENT rolled and tied with a
ribbon Without ceremony MALONE turns and walks towards

THE OCEAN - NIGHT
Where two OARSMEN shove a longboat into the surf MALONE
gets in and we’ll notice some cargo lashed-down under a
tarp
MALONE (V0O)

My mind races with the thought of

what I must now do Of what must

be done
And as they put out to sea MALONE looks back to find

ELEVEN MEN standing on the beach Silent Watching
ON MALONE

STEADY ROWING is the only SOUND we hear MALONE sits rapt in
thought when something up ahead catches his eye The
OARSMEN stop rowing and we

REVERSE ANGLE to reveal an advancing FOG BANK not 50 feet
ahead The OARSMEN look to MALONE

MALONE
Afraid of a little fog are we

He nods at them to press on They pick up the rhythm again
disappearing into the swirling mist

INT A SHIP’S HOLD - NIGHT

MOVING through the belly of a clipper ship a labyrinth of
light and shadow lit by hanging lanterns swaying from the
rafters

There are PEOPLE in here scurrying about performing what
wed guess are their assigned duties They are oddly dressed
in cloak and shroud and we cannot see their faces

A MAN dressed like the others descends the creaky stairs
into the hold His name is BLAKE and we can tell by the
‘deference paid him he is their leader

He walks amongst them with his lantern offering a gentle pat
on the back or a quiet nod

INT CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

BLAKE enters the room A WOMAN sits at a dressing table
facing away from us brushing her long dark hair We notice
her HAIRBRUSH -- made of pure gold engraved with INTRICATE
PATTERNS

On hearing BLAKE enter she pulls her shroud up over her head
and turns We see her only in profile and from this angle
she is unmistakably beautiful

BLAKE walks over to her She looks up at him uneasy
Reassuringly he reaches out to touch her face

BLAKE
Dont worry This is a new
beginning For all of us

When he pulls his hand away there is milky-white MAGGOT
wriggling on his fingertip This doesn’t seem to bother him
in the least as he flicks the thing away
Then he leans in to kiss her and his lantern lights the half
of her face we couldn’t quite see

-covered in pus-filled boils and sagging gangrenous
tissue But her eyes are alive and filled with love for this
man

They kiss

EXT OPEN WATER - NIGHT

Its as if we’ve been swallowed whole by a thick and
undulating fog creeping in on us from every side Again we
PICK UP the ROWING SOUND

-which seems to be coming at us then we could swear it’s
moving away We’re becoming more and more disoriented now
Up is down and down is up and soon the SOUND seems to wrap
around us like the fog itself when

THE BOW OF THE LONGBOAT

PIERCES the mist There’s a DULL THUD as the LONGBOAT bangs
into something not yet seen The OARSMEN stow their oars as
MALONE raises his lantern and WE SEE WHAT THEYVE HIT

THE BATTERED HULL OF THE CLIPPER SHIP

Light spills from tiny portholes belowdecks illuminating the
name painted on her bow

ELIZABETH DANE

MALONE draws a pistol The OARSMEN look surprised MALONE
reaches out RAPPING on the Dane’s hull with the butt

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
INT CAPTAINS QUARTERS - NIGHT
CLOSE ON a pair of embracing hands WIDEN to reveal they
belong to BLAKE and the WOMAN He gets up to leave but she
doesnt want to let go
BLAKE

It’s going to be fine I promise

you with all my heart
EXT THE LONGBOAT - NIGHT
MALONE sits in the LONGBOAT pistol stowed bobbing alongside

the DANE when A CLOAKED SHAPE leans out over the gunwale --
BLAKE
BLAKE
Williams

MALONE
(looking away)
Yes

BLAKE disappears momentarily A leather SATCHEL comes flying
over the rail practically hits MALONE in the head

MALONE takes out the PARCHMENT we saw earlier places it in
the satchel flings it back up on deck

MALONE
Leave the gold on deck and get your
people down below I‘11 not
subject myself to your wretched

A rope-ladder is dropped over the side The OARSMEN rise

MALONE
Wait

MALONE takes out a knife slashes open the tarp revealing
the cargo three large cans marked KEROSENE The shocked
OARSMEN look to MALONE -- nobody said anything about this

EXT ELIZABETH DANE’S DECK NIGHT

First one up MALONE lifts his lantern The deck appears
empty save for a rusted metal CHEST MALONE goes over and
flips open the lid to find it brimming with GOLD COINS

He dips into it letting the cold wealth run through his
fingers startled when HE HEARS SOMETHING

MALONE holds up his lantern sees BLAKE’s cloaked shape
standing at the bow

BLAKE
You’re not Williams

MALONE
No But I represent his interests
His and the rest of the town
fathers

MALONES hand slips behind his back producing the PISTOL
MALONE

We want the rest of your gold
Blake All of it
BLAKE
’ The deal we made was more than
fair Take whats there and go

MALONE nods to the OARSMEN who crack open the KEROSENE begin
dousing the Dane’s wooden deck

BLAKE
In God’s name what kind of people
are you

MALONE lights a wooden match with his thumbnail holds it
over the deck -- something for BLAKE to think about

BLAKE
Alright I’11 need to go below

MALONE
(blows out the match)
Go on But if you try anything
the ship burns

MALONE turns the pistol on his own men

MALONE
Go with him
OARSMAN 1
Please Dont make us go down

there With them

MALONE
Down there
(cocks the pistol)
Or up here

INT BELOWDECKS - DANE - NIGHT

We descend into the ship’s hold crowded with BLAKES people
The OARSMEN follow BLAKE covering their noses at the
unbearable stench

EXT ELIZABETH DANE’S DECK - LATER - NIGHT

MALONE stands waiting impatiently at the hatchway One of

the OARSMEN starts to come up the ladder MALONE puts his
boot on the man’s shoulder

MALONE
Gold first Then you

A heavy CHEST is thrust upwards MALONE grabs it by the
handle
The OARSMAN starts back up the ladder when MALONE kicks him
in the teeth sending him tumbling back down

MALONE kicks over a full can of KEROSENE which goes spilling
into the hold BLAKE looks out from the shadow of his cloak
EYES dark and malevolent fixing MALONE with a cursed stare

MALONE recoils at this dropping his lantern into the hold
We hear a WHUMPH as the kerosene ignites And then we hear
the SCREAMS as MALONE slams the hatch shut He shoots the
bolt across and BASHES THE HASP rendering it useless
sealing them in

Forever

In a hurry now MALONE slides the first chest to the edge of
the deck but it’s heavy and he’1l never get it down the rope
ladder by himself In a greedy panic he spots the Dane’s
lifeboat suspended by ropes at deck level

THE LIFEBOAT - A MINUTE LATER

MALONE has loaded both chests into the lifeboat SMOKE
billows up through the planks of the Dane’s deck People are
SCREAMING down below POUNDING for a way out

MALONE gets into the lifeboat takes his knife and SLASHES
the ropes holding him aloft

But one of the ropes SNAGS in a pulley dropping the bow
sharply The weight of the chests sends them SMASHING
‘through the first two bench seats threatening to crash right
through the bow and into the water

MALONE LUNGES FOR THEM as the lids POP OPEN sending hundreds
of gold coins to the bottom of the sea when

The hung rope FREES ITSELF The life boat falls smacking
down into the water Relieved MALONE turns his back on the
smoldering ship picking gold coins off the floor of the
lifeboat when

A HAND SMASHES THROUGH ONE OF THE PORTHOLES burnt flesh
dripping from the bone locking MALONE in a death grip

Out of his wits MALONE struggles to break free HACKING at
the hideous hand bashing at it with an oar as the SCREAMS
from inside the DANE build into an unholy frenzy

With a last bone-crunching WHACK the hand withers and
MALONE is free He rows away from the doomed ship using all
his strength gliding past a barnacle-encrusted BUOY
And WE HOLD ON THE BUOY bobbing in the ocean as a hundred
years of time and tide pass before our eyes

A SLEEK WHITE CHARTER BOAT powers past the BUOY splashing it
with a glassy sheet of water

NICK CASTLE 20 is on the FLYBRIDGE at the helm of this 42-
foot luxo SPORT-FISHING BOAT His hair is blown back by the
wind emphasizing his raw good looks His SWEATSHIRT tells

us who he’s working for ANTONIO BAY SPORT-FISHING CHARTERS

WORKING THE REAR OF THE BOAT is BRETT SPOONER 20 Nick’s
best friend and fellow employee Simple honest made of
good stuff SPOONERS got a mop of surfer’s hair and hasn’t
yet lost all his baby fat

SPOONER uses a mean-looking BONING KNIFE to splay open a
yellowfin while TWO SUNBURNED FISHERMEN drink beer after a
day on the water SPOONER offers up a slice of raw tuna

SPOONER
Sushi

The FISHERMEN decline so SPOONER happily sucks it down and
as the boat breezes by us well notice the name painted her
stern

SEAGRASS
EXT ANTONIO BAY - HARBOR - SUNSET

As the SEAGRASS glides-in under the harbor lights NICK
begins STRIPPING down to his boxers

EXT THE SEAGRASS - MARINA - DUSK
NICK expertly parks the boat in its slip He shuts down the
engines grabs his clothes and slides down the ladder onto
the deck where the FISHERMEN are gathering their gear
NICK
(in a hurry)

Thanks for your business guys

See you next year Hustle it up

SPOONER pulls two big fish from the FREEZER in the hold

SPOONER
Dude Nice underpants

INT CHARTER BOAT - LATER - DUSK

SPOONER enters the cabin looking for NICK
SPOONER
Yo Nick

NICK In here

INT THE HEAD - DUSK

NICK stands shirtless lean and muscled hair wet from a
shower He buttons his jeans straps on his watch checks
the time - he’s way late

SPOONER dances into the doorway stands beside NICK in the
mirror He pulls his shirt up over his considerable belly

SPOONER
Look -- twins

NICK

SPOONER starts tracing little circles around his nipples

NICK

Testicle on rye
NICK

SPOONER

SPOONER picks up NICK’S brush starts brushing his own mop
It’s hopeless

SPOONER

NICK

Stevie

NICK stops turns puts his hands on SPOONER’S shoulders

NICK
Spooner That was a one-time
thing And I regret it
(checks his watch again)
I am so late

EXT ANTONIO BAY - MAIN STREET - DUSK

NICK drives down MAIN STREET of the quaint little coastal
town past Jimmy’s Chowder Shack and the Rainy Ale Tavern

He passes the Tasty-Freeze and Tisdale’s Hardware and then
we notice the BLEACHERS erected on either side of the street
and the BANNERS proclaiming Antonio Bays 100th birthday
celebration

NEW ANGLE

As a low-hanging ground fog rounds a corner and begins
spreading towards us It flows over sidewalks and into the
streets

INT NICKS PICKUP TRUCK - DUSK

NICK drives the road out of town a can of Bud between his
legs about to take a swig when he notices

A SHERIFF’S PICKUP TRUCK parked on a berm beside the road
The door is open and we can see the SHERIFF walking up to

A BIG FOR SALE sign planted in the ground WORDING on the
sign 50 acres prime development site artists rendering
of some cookie-cutter condos phone number etc

NICK slows watching as the SHERIFF hammers something onto
the sign He yells out the window

NICK
What‘re you doin to that sign

ON THE SHERIFF

He looks over and smirks The brass bar opposite his badge
reads MALONE In his 40’s he was handsome once but TOM
MALONE now has the look of a man who has lost his edge

He takes a step towards NICK’S truck and we can see the
plaque he just nailed on SOLD

SHERIFF
What’re you doin way out here
Hotrod

NICK

Just goin for a ride Somebody
finally buy that land or what

SHERIFF
Don’t you worry about it Let’s
just say I wont be Sheriff of this
dump much longer

NICK eyes him trying to put it together
li

SHERIFF
‘What the hell’re you lookin at
(then)
I don’t smell beer in that truck
do I
NICK

No sir Not unless it’s Root Beer

TOM MALONE
Thats good Now you go on and
enjoy your ride And be sure and
obey those little white signs with
the numbers in ‘em

NICK
Yes sir
(under his breath)
Prick

NICK smiles and drives off
CUT TO
INT NICKS PICKUP TRUCK - LATER

NICK swigs his beer now scenery whipping by outside the
window He shifts the truck into high gear

NICK’S POV - NIGHT

The headlights illuminate the winding road cutting through a
dense green forest Pockets of MIST swirl and drift across
the road

From the RADIO in the dash we HEAR a sensual female voice

STEVIE (V0O)

It’s nine-thirty on a beautiful
Friday night in Antonio Bay I’m
Stevie Wayne and I’m gonna go a
little ‘old school’ on you tonight
Here’s a track from Ramones etc
on KAB 945 and streaming over
the web at kabtunescom KAB --
your alternative to the modern
music establishment

NICK
(smiling)
the voice that launched a
thousand ships

MUSIC comes over the radio NICK reaches down to turn up the
volume and when he glances up

NICKS POV - ENTERING A POCKET OF MIST
It’s a white-out WHEN SUDDENLY
A GIRL APPEARS IN THE MIST

NICK SWERVES and hits the brakes watching her in the
headlights as he passes by Shes hitch-hiking a suitcase
at her feet And she’s hot

He checks his watch again looks back at the GIRL as if torn
And now she’s eyeing him too

NICK
Shit

He puts on the brakes makes a‘u-turn and goes back for her
He pulls over rolls down his window

NICK
Hi

GIRL
Hi yourself

NICK
Don’t you know hitch-hiking is
dangerous

The GIRL just shrugs

NICK
You want a ride

GIRL
But you’re headed in the wrong
direction

NICK
(with a big smile)
Not anymore

The GIRL picks up her suitcase sashays around the front of
the truck and opens the door She is barely 20 beautiful
and strong -- a dream of a girl-next-door

GIRL
You’ re not a freak or anything
Are you

NICK
Yeah Actually I am

GIRL
(smiling)
Good

She gets in and closes the door She looks straight ahead
but they aren’t going anywhere

She finally turns to NICK who looks at her with gleaming
almost mesmeric eyes She starts to say something when he
reaches out tracing the line of her jaw her lips

Suddenly she’s all over him and he just rolls with it Soon
they are reaching inside each other’s clothes popping
buttons sliding down in the seat

5 GIRL
God I missed you
(stops kissing him)
And Nick

NICK
Yes Elizabeth

ELIZABETH
Next time don’t be late

They go at it again quickly disappearing from view

CAMERA SLOWLY BOOMS UP from the truck RISING through the
trees to reveal the STARS the craggy COASTLINE anda
familiar-looking LIGHTHOUSE out on the point

Its BEACON strakes the horizon fingering the darkness
‘moving on as we HEAR

STEVIE (0S)
It’s a little after 10 o’clock and
Im Stevie Wayne your very own
beacon in-the-night

CAMERA races at the LIGHTHOUSE with lightning speed BLINDED
for an instant by the LIGHT on top as it whooshes by again
and now were

INSIDE that same small glass-enclosed room at the top of the
old stone lighthouse -- now the broadcast booth of KAB

CLOSE ON STEVIE WAYNE -- 20’s funkily sensual a young Joan
Jett type Her hair is up and she wears a cut-up Ramones T-
shirt She uses her bare foot to adjust the mike

STEVIE
Im high tonight in the KAB
lighthouse on Spivey Point
and I’m being paid the big bucks to
remind everybody this Sunday marks
Antonio Bay’s 100th anniversary
Dammit

PULL BACK to find STEVIE sitting at her console one foot on
the board painting her toe nails with deep purple polish
She grabs a kleenex to dab a smudge

STEVIE
you can say that on the radio
nowadays Anyway by now you know

the drill The big shin-dig is
planned for Sunday with a surprise
performance by a local band you
won’t wanna miss So go she said
and if you don’t have a date you
can always take me along to keep
you company

She flips a switch and another SONG begins to play
Instantly the phones LIGHT UP STEVIE looks flatly at the
flashing lights

STEVIE
I don’t mean literally you morons

EXT MERRY MARKET - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

The lights on the MERRY-MARKET SIGN go out A HAND turns a
CLOSED SIGN in the window The GROUND FOG hovers outside the
door

INT MERRY MARKET - ANTONIO BAY - NIGHT

A BAG BOY picks up his broom cranks the volume on his radio
as the song Stevie just cued plays in the bg He goes to
straighten a display of canned goods when something makes

him stop

He looks around the store eying the creepy old curios
dangling from the ceiling hanging on walls etc --

Shaking it off he starts to sweep when the lights inside
the soda cases begin to flicker and buzz

BOTTLES start CLINKING together on the shelves The whole
place starts to RATTLE AND HUM now as stuff falls and breaks
in the aisles

BAG BOY
Shit It’s the big one

He drops his broom and races for the exit when he sees

THE AUTOMATIC DOORS slamming open and shut all on their own
fast and erratic -- lethal even --- and when he turns he
sees something that freezes him in his tracks

MICROWAVE POPCORN starts to POP Still in the packages
Right on the shelf

EXT ANTONIO BAY SAVINGS AND LOAN - NIGHT

The screen on the ATM begins BUZZING with a weird sepia-tone
FLUX It looks like there’s an IMAGE trying to form
somewhere in there but then we hear the KA-CHUNK of the cash
dispenser as TWENTIES begin spitting from the machine

An OLD LADY passes by her eyeglasses on a decorative chain
around her neck At first she just keeps walking but when
she realizes no one is watching she goes back scooping the
bills into her purse

EXT SERVICE STATION - NIGHT

Closed Dark The AIR HOSE DING-DING’s But there’s nobody
there

One of the gas NOZZLES falls off the pump begins discharging
GASOLINE which slowly spreads across the parking lot

EXT PET WORLD - NIGHT

Through the window we gee DOGS GOING NUTS in their cages
barking at the moon spinning chasing their tails

EXT REAL ESTATE OFFICE - NIGHT

There’s a cheery SIGN out front with a digital TIMETEMP
display The thing is going haywire -- 34 o’clock 299
degrees etc And for the briefest moment we could swear it
spells cut a word DANE

EXT BEACH NIGHT

A burned-out BEACHCOMBER in a tattered navy pea coat shuffles
up the beach In one hand is a METAL DETECTOR which he
waves over the sand In the other is a FLASK

He takes a drink and we notice his thrashed sea captain’s cap
and a headset that attaches to the metal detector He grunts
as the booze goes down looks up with bloodshot eyes

EXT A ROCKY COVE - NIGHT

MUSIC PLAYS OVER a dozen young PARTIERS hanging out around a
blazing BONFIRE guzzling beer making out passing a doob
etc

NICK and ELIZABETH are here along with their friends SEAN
REED and EMILY MOSS NICK puts his arm around ELIZABETH
pulls her close

NICK
Hey You happy
ELIZABETH
Mmmm-hmmm
NICK

ELIZABETH

Bon a petit
NICK gets an evil smile She kisses him deeply Young love

The SONG we’ve been listening to ENDS and we hear STEVIE’s
VOICE over the airwaves

STEVIE (0S)
It’s almost midnight on KAB Im

Elizabeth Williams Antonio Bays

A new song PLAYS The friends raise their beers ad libbing

Bay

ELIZABETH smiles a sad little smile suddenly looks away

ELIZABETH
Did you hear that

EMILY

ELIZABETH

I dunno I thought I Nevermind

Something sweeps behind ELIZABETH in a blur but neither she
nor EMILY sees it

ELIZABETH shrugs if off POPS open her beer when

SOMETHING COMES HURTLING out of the darkness landing SMACK IN
EMILY’S LAP -- viscera and mandibles and shell -- like that
skittering ALIEN on the guy’s face in the movie

EMILY and ELIZABETH JUMP UP SCREAMING until they realize
it’s just a DEAD SPINY LOBSTER upside-down in the sand

NICK and SEAN run up laughing high-fiving each other

ELIZABETH
Hardy-har children

EMILY
Thats so not cool

SEAN

Suddenly A PALE WHITE FACE appears in the darkness behind
them seems to hover there

FACE

NICK
Jesus Machen What the hell do

MACHEN looks around sizing up the partiers with lusty eyes

MACHEN

SEAN

Hey Machen I got yer beer

SEAN fakes like he’s gonna throw the can when ELIZABETH
takes it hands-it politely to MACHEN

MACHEN

You’ re welcome

MACHEN guzzles some beer which runs down his chin while NICK
eyeballs the taped-together metal detector

NICK
You been up and down the beach with
that thing every day since I can
remember What the hell’re you
looking for

MACHEN reaches into his pocket pulis out a gleaming GOLD
COIN exactly like the ones we saw in the opening

MACHEN
More of these

ELIZABETH
What is it

MACHEN
You sure you wanna know

NICK
What Are we gonna get a curse or
something Oooococohhhh
They all laugh but not MACHEN
MACHEN
It’s the coin of greed The coin
of lust The coin of doom
The PARTIERS look at each other

SEAN
Youre freaky-deaky old man

MACHEN checks his watch
MACHEN
Five minutes till midnight
Not much time left
MACHEN turns towards the fire staring into it
MACHEN
In five minutes it’11 be the
twenty-first of April

SEAN
So

MACHEN puts the coin on his tongue the takes a swig of beer
SWALLOWS IT

MACHEN
They’11 get nothin’ from me

Now MACHEN just stares transe-like into the crackling fire

There is a hushed silence as the PARTIERS just stare at the
BEACHCOMBER Only the HISS of the flames and then

THE SOUND OF AN ENGINE blasts open the silence as

SPOONER DRIVES THE SEAGRASS RIGHT UP ONTO THE BEACH

He jumps off onto the sand obviously drunk He’s got a
camcorder in his hand taping two BEAUTIFUL BLONDES in
sweatshirts and bikini bottoms

And as they come off the boat we realize one of the girls a

INT NICK’S PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT

of the engine

ELIZABETH
Youre not still blaming me
NICK

didn’t want to leavewas you

SUDDENLY THE TRUCK’S WINDOWS EXPLODE SHATTERING INTO A
MILLION PIECES

ELIZABETH ducks SCREAMING as glass FLIES everywhere NICK
drops down to protect her and the truck swerves to the side
of the road banging to a stop against the curb

NEW ANGLE BELOW THE DASH

On NICK and ELIZABETH hunkered down in the cab as the dust
settles

NICK

NICK
What the hell was that

And when they SIT UP
THERES A FIGURE LOOMING IN THE WINDOW They both JUMP

Nothing but STATIC SEAN taps GENERATOR’S fuel gage -- ia
tank left At least they’ve got that

ON DECK

SPOONER is mixing cocktails when the STATIC begins blocking
out the signal from KAB

He goes over to mess with the stereo when something OFF
CAMERA grabs his attention He puts the camcorder down (it
is still running) goes over to the rail
A PULSING GLOW of bone-colored light reflected on his face
SPOONER

I think there’s a friggin’ fog bank

out there
INT STEERING HOUSE

SEAN turns glances out the window The unearthly light
PULSATES on his FACE

SEAN
What the hell is that

EXT THE FOG - NIGHT

An eerie WHITE WALL is almost upon them lit from within by
some strange phosphorescent light Soon it blots out the
entire horizon Glowing Throbbing Swirling

EXT SEAGRASS - NIGHT

SPOONER backs away from the rail as THE FOG begins drifting
into frame flowing and shifting enveloping the SEAGRASS

We begin to HEAR A HOLLOW RUSHING SOUND like BREATHING
ragged and phlegmy SPOONER looks around disoriented

SEAN (0S)
Spooner Whats out there

EXT REAR OF THE BOAT - GENERATOR HOLD - NIGHT

The FOG drifts along the rear of the boat with a strange
fluidity almost WITH PURPOSE

As it reaches the GENERATOR HOLD it SWEEPS DOWN curling
into the cracks and seams around the hold as if it knows
precisely where it wants to go

INT STEERING HOUSE

SPOONER and the girls come racing into the steering house
SLAMMING the door behind them

INT GENERATOR HOLD

The FOG drifts down and is INHALED BY THE CARBURETOR The
generator begins to CLANK and SMOKE and finally BREAKS DOWN

SPOONER grabs a FLASHLIGHT races out of the steering house
leaving SEAN and the girls inside

EXT SEAGRASS

SPOONER can barely see two feet in front of him as THE FOG
continues to PULSE The RUSHING sound grows louder with each
passing moment He clicks on the flashlight swings the beam
down at

POV - GENERATOR HOLD

BLACK SMOKE pours from the hold

SPOONER leans down to get a better view when he hears a
CREAKING NOISE beside the boat He swings the flashlight

around points it into the fog

SPOONER
Hello Is somebody out there

POV - INTO THE FOG
As the flashlight FINDS SOMETHING -- a thick rusted CHAIN

rising out of the water He follows it up to its source and
we finally see it

THE CHARRED ROTTING HULL OF A CLIPPER SHIP

SPOONER
SEAN You gotta see this

INT STEERING HOUSE

SEAN hurries out of the wheelhouse past the two girls shuts

and opens it
EXT THE SEAGRASS - NIGHT

SPOONER and SEAN stand listening to a SOUND coming from the

SPOONER
What is that

And now FOOTSTEPS coming towards them closer closer
SPOONER shines the flashlight in that direction BUT THERES
NOTHING THERE

SEAN
We gotta get the hell outta here
Spooner

Suddenly HYSTERICAL CRIES peal from the steering house
Theres a horrible THUDDING sound as if bodies are being
heaved and broken then

DEAD SILENCE ©

SEAN and SPOONER are freaked out of their minds They stand
there in the quiet frozen by fear when

A BODY COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE STEERING HOUSE WINDOW hits
the deck with a wet smack SPOONER shines the light down -- -
it’s one of the GIRLS -- wig askew her body bent and twisted

in ways it was never meant to go

SPOONER turns to face SEAN the flashlight wavering in his
hand when suddenly

SEAN’S body JOLTS His head snaps back arms and legs
spraddled as if pinioned by some invisible overwhelming
force

and the following happens fast THE FOG formless at
first quickly compacts itself into something too grotesque
to be human but capable of very human movements

IT TAKES UP THE BONING KNIFE inching it closer and closer to
SEAN’S EYES

SEAN
HELP ME SPOONER 1

ON SPOONER NOW eyes wide in horror as we HEAR two obscene
PUNCTURE SOUNDS

SPOONER backs up stumbling He catches himself and when he
turns

The FOG is there inches from his face He tells himself
this can’t be real

THE FOG seizes hold of SPOONER’S neck its “fingers” pressing
the flesh on either side of his vertebrae It rears back
now like a cobra about to strike when

SPOONER opens his mouth in a scream that never comes as THE
FOG suddenly DIVES DOWN HIS THROAT And off the HORRIBLE
SOUND of CARTILAGE and TISSUE being forced beyond their
limits we

AN OLD STONE CHURCH - NIGHT

Dark stone and bleeding mortar Built to last A SPIRE juts
skyward in a tapered pike housing the church’s CLOCKTOWER
At its peak is a LARGE CROSS

The FACE AND HANDS OF THE CLOCK are black and without luster
tarnished by a century’s exposure to the elements They tell
us it is now HALF-PAST MIDNIGHT and as we HEAR the’ SOUND of
an approaching vehicle CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to

A CEMETERY

Next door to the church HEADLIGHTS splash over GRAVESTONES
a few of which are simple slabs but most are more elaborate
as was the fashion at the turn of the century

NICKS truck passes the cemetery pulls to a stop in front of
the church

recedes we can see SOMETHING SHINY wedged between the
rocks

A FRESH-FACED LITTLE BOY

Comes bounding up the beach This is the boy we saw in the
PHOTO He plays a game with the tide trying to stay dry
sending the sandpipers scurrying when SOMETHING CATCHES HIS
EYE

He walks over bends down to see something GOLD glinting in
the sunlight half-buried in the sand

‘Another wave crashes down The BOY reaches for the thing
and when the water recedes HE GRABS IT

He holds it up wiping away the sand and slime when we
realize it’s THE GOLD HAIRBRUSH from the opening caked with
crud its bristles eaten away by the sea

accident Now get off the boat

Alright alright I heard you the

lying where SPOONER left it He makes sure MALONE’S not
looking then

He shoves the CAMCORDER under his shirt and goes
CUT TO
THE LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

Tall and majestic in the afternoon sun EMBLAZONED on the
side is KAB 945 STEVIE pulls up in her convertible
gathers her stuff and gets out

INT THE LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

STEVIE enters through the door at the base of the lighthouse
moving past some work closets storage cabinets etc She
ascends the three-story SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads to

BROADCAST BOOTH - DAY

STEVIE comes in and dumps her stuff (including the BRUSH) on
a console by the wall singing a little ditty of her own

STEVIE
I don’t wanna work today so
everybody go away Cause Stevie
wants to shop and play

She hits some buttons and flips some switches and the
stations electronics start to WHIRR

STEVIE
let some other poor sap do my
broadcast today

STEVIE pops the PROMOS disk into the CD tray She takes an
apple from her bag starts slicing it into pieces with a
knife In the bg we HEAR the ANNOUNCER TAG another dumb
BIRTHDAY jingle

CHORUS
Hap-py Birthday from your friends
at Pet-World Hap-py Birthday
Antonio-o Bay

STEVIE shakes her head -- pathetic She sits down in her
chair slips off her shoes and rolls across the room to her
computer

She fires it up glancing at the meters and dials on the
wall when we notice A RED GLOW RISING ON THE SIDE OF HER
FACE She feels it now and slowly she turns

ANGLE ON THE GOLD BRUSH

GLOWING RED HOT on the console The years of sea-grit BURN
AWAY WISPS OF SMOKE APPEAR NOW as THE CONSOLE UNDERNEATH
THE BRUSH BEGINS TO MELT

STEVIE stares at it in disbelief when IN HER EYES we see a
BRIGHT RED FLASH SHE SCREAMS

THE BRUSH

Has ignited ONE OF ANDY’S CRAYON DRAWINGS tacked to the wall
above the console In an instant another one catches and
now THE WALL IS ON FIRE

WITH STEVIE

As she races down the spiral staircase The throws open one
of the storage closets pulls out a FIRE EXTINGUISHER

CUT TO
THE SCREEN BECOMES A WHITE-OUT FROM WHICH EMERGES

STEVIE firing a blast of CO9 As the dust settles THE

FIRST THING WE NOTICE is THE HOLE IN THE CONSOLE TOP -- a
perfect outline of the BRUSH which has melted completely
through

But underneath THE BRUSH HAS VANISHED and we WIDEN to see

The fire has SCORCHED THE PLASTER where the art once hung

REVEALING A WEIRD PATTERN on the lighthouse wall Maybe a

window or a trap door was here once but it has long since
- been BRICKED-IN

STEVIE reaches up brushing away blistered plaster when

ONE OF THE BRICKS comes loose in its mortar She pokes at it
curiously SURPRISED WHEN IT GIVES WAY and we can HEAR it
fall into the hollow of the wall

She drops the fire extinguisher and stands there staring at
the open hole She leans in peering into the void but it’s
PITCH DARK in there and she can’t see a thing

She jimmies a few more bricks loose drops them on the floor
With more light now she sticks her head in

STEVIE’S POV INSIDE THE WALL

SHE SEES SOMETHING wedged between the studs but the light
doesnt quite hit it Whatever it is it appears to be
wrapped or wound in something

POV - INSIDE THE HOLE - A MINUTE LATER

STEVIE’S ARM REACHES INfingers feeling around blindly
straining for the thing but she can’t quite reach it when

SOMETHING LASHES AROUND HER WRIST
ON STEVIE’S TERRIFIED FACE

As she tries to pull her arm from the hole THE LIGHTS and
ELECTRONICS in the room begin to flicker and buzz and
whatever has her PULLS HER INTO THE WALL with force enough
to send the rest of the bricks cascading down around her

SHE FALLS SHRIEKING in horror at what’s now attached to her
hand

CLOSE ON HER HAND - AN OLD BOOK IS TETHERED TO IT BY A
LIVING SNARL OF LONG BLACK HATR LACED WITH SAND AND SLIME
AND UNDULATING SEAWEED

She goes for a pair of SCISSORS on the desk HACKING AT THE
SLIMY MASS YELLOW OOZE spurts from the SEAWEED TENDRILS as
whatever it is FINALLY LETS GO and the book falls to the
floor

She checks her wrist where the thing had hold of her -- red
puffy rising welts

She looks down at the book only now it’s just a dusty old
leatherbound book No sign of anything strange

She tilts her head to make out the gold-embossed words on the
books cover

STEVIE hangs up She looks over at the HOLE IN THE WALL
then at the JOURNAL utterly chillingly confused Then she
makes a decision

She takes off her sweatshirt throws it over the book then
kicks at it to be sure it’s “dead”

Satisfied she brings a wastebasket over and in one quick
motion scoops up the book and dumps it in keeping her
distance
She goes to her computer types something in The DISPLAY
READS PRE-RECORDED TRACKS - 6000 She hits ENTER and the
Meter starts ticking down She checks her watch picks up
the WASTEBASKET and goes

STICKING OUT BETWEEN THE PAGES

Hesitant she picks it up pulling out TWO OLD CREASED
PHOTOGRAPHS

THE FIRST is a panorama-type taken from a hillside vantage
point Its A FLEDGLING TOWN with a few ramshackle
buildings a muddy dirt road a couple of mules and a
handful of people At the bottom in white lettering it
reads ANTONIO BAY - 1905

THE SECOND PHOTO is of our TWELVE MEN assembled on the

eyes when behind her WE SEE SEAN SIT UP ON THE STEEL TABLE

CLOSE ON HIS PURPLED FEET - as they hit the linoleum moving
stiffly across the floor

Hearing this ELIZABETH stops Slowly she TURNS

MRS KOBRITZ stands in the kitchen She strikes a match

lights a few CANDLES when she hears a strange GURGLING
coming from the sink

She picks up one of the candles leans down to get a better
look

HER POV - THE SINK

The drain is backing up The garbage disposal begins
coughing up dark scummy water

MRS KOBRITZ
Shit

She gets a plunger from under the sink and goes to work as
the PIPES begin to rattle and groan

She leans down again inspecting but the drain is still
clogged Some greasy bubbles rise ominously to the surface

Reluctantly she pushes up her sleeve and sticks her hand in
up to the elbow grimacing feeling around for a long beat

Finally there comes a look on her face as if she’s found the
problem when

Her arm is tugged by something unseen There’s a puzzled
look on her face and then

KERSPLASH Her arm is jerked violently down the drain
SUBMERSING HER FACE in the DARK WATER BUBBLES ROIL as the
old woman screams and struggles beneath the surface as she
is JERKED DOWN AGAIN HARDER AND HARDER when

SUDDENLY the THRASHING STOPS

We’re behind her now as she stands up gasping for breath
hair dripping unctuous water on her bright pant-suit

HER POV - as she pulls her arm from the water

TO FIND IT COVERED IN PUS-FILLED BOILS AND SAGGING
GANGRENOUS TISSUE

She TURNS TO FACE US NOW A STEAMING MONSTROSITY OF GREEN
ROTTING FLESH AND YELLOW OOZING PUS

to the bone Her rotting lips curl away as her false teeth
drop from her mouth and hit the floor

STEVIE tries to start the car one last time Hopeless
Outside the weird strobing of the lighthouse beacon
continues BUT WHAT SHE DOESNT SEE are tiny wisps of THE
FOG SEEPING-IN THROUGH THE VENTS IN THE DASH

Before she can react tendrils of the stuff surge in moving
past her shoulders LOCKING THE DOORS

THE FOG jerks the seatbelt out of its reel PINNING STEVIE TO
HER SEAT BY THE THROAT

HER SEAT SLIDES BACK - her feet can no longer touch the
brakes

The GEARSHIFT POPS INTO NEUTRAL and the CAR BEGINS TO ROLL
(towards the cliff above the ocean which we can’t see but we
know is there)

With one hand clutching at the belt around her neck STEVIE
grabs the parking brake with the other THE FOG fights her

for it rasping at her fingers turning them bloody until

she finally must let go

The car keeps rolling building momentum now as STEVIE SEES
A BUTTON ON THE DASH

DEFROSTER

She hits it full blast Her hair BLOWS BACK THE FOG makes
a weird almost child-like SOUND as the warm air from the
defrosters hits

THE FOG seems to diminish somehow and in that instant she
pulls the seatbelt from around her neck

touches his face almost caressing it

It draws him in examining him now like a piece of meat ina
butcher shop Finally the two of them are face to face
almost as if it is searching for something in TOM MALONE’S
eyes

MALONE IS SUDDENLY YANKED HEAD-FIRST INTO THE BELLY OF THE
FOG with unimaginable force His body flops around in mad
convulsions as

THE FRONT DOORS OF THE CHURCH FLY OPEN

THE FOG EXPLODES OUT THE DOORS DRAGS MALONE WITH IT KICKING
AND SCREAMING

EXT THE CHURCH - NIGHT

NICK and ELIZABETH run outside joined by ANDY and FATHER
MALONE The Fog has completely lifted from around the
church save for that which now drags TOM off through the
trees

‘

ELIZABETH
Cmon Weve got to see
NICK
What
ELIZABETH

It’s not over
INT LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

STEVIE opens the circuit-breaker panel in the wall pulls the
one labelled ‘BEACON’

The “show” outside the windows goes dark

CLOSE ON - THE ACCESS WINDOW

It’s OPEN

THE DOOR TO THE STAIRS SLAMS SHUT - the only way out
FREAKED STEVIE goes over tries the knob when
THE LIGHTS GO OUT

SUDDENLY STEVIE LETS OUT A YELP She lifts up her arm sees
a SLASH across it

SHE SQUIRMS as if being contained by forces unseen
something PULLING HER HAIR NOW arching her head back as

CAMERA FOLLOWS A KNIFE

As it appears from the darkness below her waistline the
glimmering point tracing a line across her flat stomach up
and around the curves of her breasts

It slows as it reaches her slender neck pressing against her
throat in the shape of a smile before working its way up her
cheek the glinting point rising slowly before her right eye
A TEAR runs down her face

The lock on the door CLICKS DOOR SWINGS SLOWLY OPEN and
whatever it is LEADS STEVIE OUT

EXT THE WOODS - NIGHT

WE’RE OVERHEAD MOVING THROUGH THE TREETOPS LOOKING DOWN ON
TOM MALONE as he’s ripped through the woods by THE FOG
scraping over rocks and stumps whipsawing madly as if being
drawn by a team of wild horses

EXT LIGHTHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

STEVIE steps out onto the railing kicking and clawing for
dear life THE VOICES RISE AGAIN THE FACES ARE CLOSE
ENOUGH TO TOUCH SWIRLING IN THE MIST She clings to the
rail desperate for a handhold fighting for her life

But the thing with the knife SLAMS HER BACK AGAINST THE
LIGHTHOUSE WALL THE KNIFE BLADE jammed against her cheek
pushing her face towards the sea FORCING HER TO LOOK

‘AND OUT THERE IN THE MIST ANCHORED IN THE WATERS OFF SPIVEY
POINT IS A SMALL CLIPPER SHIP

THE ELIZABETH DANE
EXT A CLEARING - NIGHT

MALONE’S battered body emerges from the woods finally
DROPPED in the middle of a clearing

MALONE looks up and as THE FOG releases him it begins to
CHANGE FORM slowly evolving into the image of someone we
recognize

BLAKE - THE MAN WHO WAS WRONGED 100 YEARS AGO

Behind him a WALL OF FOG rolls out of the forest WITHIN IT
APPEAR ALL THE GHOSTS OF THE ELIZABETH DANE

and as WE WIDEN we see THE FOR SALE SIGN planted in the
dirt and IT’S THEN WE REALIZE THE LEPERS HAVE RETURNED TO
THEIR LAND

EXT LIGHTHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

STEVIE FIGHTS WITH EVERYTHING SHE HAS LEFT AS THE THING WITH
THE KNIFE FORCES HER UP ONTO THE RAILING NOW TEETERING SHE
LOOKS DOWN

HER POV - JAGGED ROCKS BELOW OCEAN CRASHING

EXT THE CLEARING - NIGHT

Battered and bruised MALONE rises toa his hands and knees
NEW ANGLE

As NICK ELIZABETH ANDY and FATHER MALONE reach the edge of
the clearing

THEIR POV -
“103

BLAKE’S GHOST stands over TOM MALONE who tries to crawl
away as

THE GROUND BENEATH HIM SUDDENLY LIQUIFIES HE’S SINKING INTO
IT LIKE WET CEMENT THAT CLINGS TO HIS ARMS AND LEGS IN GLOBS
AND HE’S UP TO HIS CHEST NOW AND THE MORE HE STRUGGLES THE

DEEPER HE SINKS

HE LETS OUT AN UNEARTHLY SCREAM AND NOW WE CAN ONLY SEE HIS
EYES AND THEN

HE IS GONE

BLAKE pulls back his CLOAK revealing his ghostly leprous
face and now ANOTHER GHOST APPEARS It too pulls its
cloak back and we realize this is HIS WIFE

He reaches out to her and she to him HE PULLS HER CLOSE AND
THEY KISS

and as they do THEIR LEPROUS SKIN IS HEALED
And for a fleeting moment we see them in their true forms

-AND THEN THEY JUST DISSOLVE ABSORBED LIKE SO MUCH RAIN
WATER IN THE THIRSTY EARTH

THEIR SOULS FINALLY AT REST

EXT LIGHTHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

THE KNIFE AT STEVIE’S THROAT FALLS AWAY dropping into the
ocean far below She falls back onto the railing and gathers
herself

The night is clear The thing with the knife is gone There
is complete silence

FADE TO BLACK
And over black WE HEAR
STEVIE (V0)
I don’t think any of us can really
say what happened last night
’ FADE UP
INT LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

STEVIE is at her console with the microphone ANDY plays
close by

STEVIE
Maybe the fog was trying to send us
a message Or maybe it was leading
us somewhere

EXT ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - DAY

ELIZABETH locks the front door She picks up her suitcase
comes down the sidewalk

STEVIE (VO)

but if this has been anything
more than a nightmare and if all
of us don’t wake up snug and warm
in our beds

INT NICKS PICKUP TRUCK - DAY
She gets in takes NICKS hand as they drive away
STEVIE (V0O)
look into the darkness across
the water Look for the fog

INT CHURCH - DAY
FATHER MALONE grasps a slab from the stone wall of the
church He pulls it away revealing a hollow space behind
He lays the JOURNAL inside then SLIDES the big slab back
into place starts cementing it with MORTAR

STEVIE (V0O)
It could come again

THE END
