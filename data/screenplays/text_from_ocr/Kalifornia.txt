SHOOTING DRAFT

EXT - NIGHT

Its raining like hell Flashes of lightning reveal

momentary

glimpses of a decayed urbanindustrial landscape Far
below

us a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in
the

drowning earth We descend toward the rock Sporadic
flashes

of lightning distort our perspective of the stone It
looks

strangely beautiful like a diamond stuck in the dark
mud

Closer Closer

Suddenly STRONG MALE HANDS cut across the frame and
wrench

it free from its muddy grave Even closer And we
discover

that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming
with

every kind of slithering repulsive insect FLASH

Lightning obliterates the frame

( FLASHES OF LIGHT from lightning car headlights

photographic strobe units and flashlights are used
throughout

the following sequences as recurring transitional
devices)

As she closes the car door the man notices that her

stained with blood In her other hand she clings

Several people laugh amazed that Carrie knows Brian so

CLAUDIA

The rooms crowded with people Theres a lot of noise
shop talk banter Clipped conversations overlap as
find Brian with his friend Eric They are in the midst
making a blender of margaritas
BRIAN

Im talking about the mind and

culpability of a serial killer

Someone who has no ability to

distinguish between right and wrong

should not be imprisoned let alone

executed

Eric dumps in a handful of ice cubes as Brian pours in
booze

ERIC
Oh here we go again Lets just lay
it all at the altar of misfiring
synapses amok biochemicals and
horrendous childhoods

BRIAN
Look its a fact most of these
people suffer from a severe chemical
brain imbalance

(beat)
That enough Tequila

fq

ERIC
Probably not

Brian pours in the rest of the bottle

BRIAN
(to Eric)
The answer is research and treatment
under hospital supervised conditions
not the electric chair

Eric looks for triple sec in the cupboards PETER
overhears

them on his way to the refrigerator

PETER
Yeah until its your mothers head
they find in the refrigerator

He pulls open the refrigerator door and grabs two
beers

Carrie steps up behind Brian

BRIAN
Executing the killer wouldnt bring
my mother back

CARRIE
Thank god

Brian turns to see Carrie now behind him She wraps her
arms

around his neck

BRIAN

(sarcastic to Carrie)
Ha ha
ERIC
Yeah but itd sure make you feel
better wouldnt it

BRIAN
No it wouldnt make me feel better

Peter finds triple sec in the refrigerator

PETER
Looking for this

Eric takes the triple sec from Peter and pours some in
the
blender He turns it on It whines

CARRIE
(to Brian)
If I have to listen to one more
tweed talk about his dissertation

ERIC
(to Brian)
Label it anyway you want the bottom
line is these people are evil plain
and simple

Brian finds her slumped down on the couch He sits
down

Brian and Carrie start to gather their stuff Carrie

recorded everything

fact that this place repels her
Brian presses a button on the audio cassette player
The

we
slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a
woman
being tortured and pleading for her life

Carrie fires off a series of shots from different
angles
Brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened
Screams

from the audio tape bounce off the walls

BRIAN

(speaks into his small

hand held tape

recorder)
His mother had him working in here
before he was eight years old
killing animals with a sledgehammer
that was bigger than he was
Brian and Carrie walk through the remains of a doorway

into
another room
BRIAN
When she was pissed at him shed
beat the shit out of him and lock
him in here overnight
The pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a
steady
whimpering
BRIAN
(continuing)
Eventually the boy wakes up one
morning picks up that sledgehammer
and starts hurting back

Carrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior
Then
she stops turns and walks out of the room Shes had
enough

Brian follows after her

BRIAN
Theres more

Carrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear

BRIAN
Look I know youre pissed off
