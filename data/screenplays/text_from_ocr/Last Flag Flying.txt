suspended from the ceiling On the show a nervous couple try
to explain to a sarcastic cop what they are doing in the
projects if not buying drugs Sals only customer OTOOLE
an old functioning alcoholic is watching At some point Doc
enters pausing near the door OToole gives him a cursory
glance Doc hangs his garment bag on a hook on the stanchion
and takes a stool He puts his AWOL bag on another stool and

They space out the coffins The escorts stand at attention
Our three move toward the Marine The COLONEL steps forward
He is ramrod straight around 40 used to being feared He
addresses Sal in a lower voice suitable to the occasion

COLONEL
Mister Shepherd

Sal nods to Doc who stands dumbly his eyes on the flag-
covered box that contains his son The Colonel extends his
hand Doc shakes it

COLONEL (CONTD)
Mr Shepherd Im Colonel Willits
The President of the United States
has asked me to express his deep
regret that your son was killed in
action

( )

Sal cant help himself and rolls his eyes

DOC
Thank you

COLONEL WILLITS
He died a hero in the service of
his country He was an inspiration
to his fellow Marines

WASHINGTON the escort stands at stony attention He is a
young black man also a lance corporal Something is wrong
with his ear lobe It is covered with tiny bumps and looks
like it is rotting away He is 20 and though taught to kill
he gives off a sense of basic goodness

DOC
Can I see him

COLONEL WILLITS
Sir that would be ill-advised
Trust me on this You do not want
to see him like that

DOC
I dont know I think I have to

COLONEL WILLITS
Sir Lance Corporal Shepherd was
hit in the back of head I can

assure you he felt no pain but
the exit wound in such a case is
devastating to the face

DOC

They were behind him They shot him
from behind

MUELLER
Take the Colonels advice Doc
Best to remember him as he was

Doc thinks about it looks to Sal

SAL
Id have to see him but thats me
The thing is you dont have to
listen to no colonels no more
Those days are gone

The Colonel seems to recoil his jaw tightens Washington
sees it and twitches

( )

DOC
Im gonna see my son

COLONEL WILLITS
What you see you will not be able
to un-see

Doc
I understand but I have to

COLONEL WILLITS
As you wish Lance Corporal
Washington escort these two
gentlemen to the coffee mess

Washington leads them away At the table they turn and watch
Doc Washington holds his attention stance

SAL
Listen up why dont you stand at
ease youre givin me a stiff
neck

WASHINGTON
(relaxing)
Man never heard anyone talk to the
Colonel like that

SAL
Colonels dont scare me kid Never

WASHINGTON

Sal slides up his sleeve and reveals his tattoo

WASHINGTON (CONTD)
I thought so

SAL
I got more time in the chow line

WASHINGTON
(to Mueller)

MUELLER

Semper Fi do or die How do you

( )

SAL
Hey kid The fucks wrong your

WASHINGTON

You get bit by a teeny sand fly
They say itll go away In a year

SAL
Thats one ugly ear

MUELLER
This is a big mistake

They look at Doc who braces himself then buckles at the
knees when the coffin lid is lifted Sal takes a step toward
him but Mueller gently stops him with the crook of his cane

MUELLER (CONTD)
Nothing you can do now Or do you
just want to out-tough a colonel

SAL

MUELLER

( )

MUELLER

WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON

Washington hesitates

SAL (CONTD)

WASHINGTON

(MORE )

( )

WASHINGTON (CONTD)
Me and Shepherd and three other
dudes were all day humping school
supplies Tablets pencils some
new books It was our last run
pissed-off mode sand down our
throats and up our asses One guy
said he wished he was in the
fuckin Navy We started dissin
swabbies calling them chickens of
the sea shit like that Then Shep
says my Old man was a swabby a
medical corpsman wound up with the
Marines in Nam I asked him how
long he put in and Shepherd says
about five years but a couple of
them in the brig Anyway we was
always stoppin at this little
store we called Abduls Haji Mart
for Haji Cokes It was my turn to
make the run but Shep said hed do
it So he gets out and were
bullshitting Then this raghead
comes up behind him shouts out Ala
Akbar or whatever you know God is
great and then he puts a cap in
Sheps head

This sinks in

SAL
What happened next

WASHINGTON
Shit man we went off Lit ‘em all
up - that raghead Abdul and damn
near the whole fuckin hood

Sal and Mueller just take this in

WASHINGTON (CONTD)
We carried Larry back to the Hummer
and went home Fuck a whole bunch
of school supplies

SAL
Hes supposed to get a Bronze Star
behind this

WASHINGTON
Oh hell get the Star The more
Stars the better right
They look over at Doc as the Colonel lowers the coffin lid

Doc still braces himself against it

( )

MUELLER

We cant tell him about this
SAL

We cant
MUELLER

Let him have his Bronze Star his
burial at Arlington with honors
Let him have his hero Lord knows
hes had little enough in his life

SAL

You mean let him have the lie
MUELLER

Yes Whats more important
SAL

I dont know but its never the

lie

Sal walks toward the coffin toward Doc and the Colonel
Mueller trails behind slowed by his cane Washington takes
Muellers arm and they move a little faster that way As they
get closer they can overhear the Colonel

COLONEL WILLITS
Im sorry sir but there is always
a sound reason for my
recommendations

Doc is trembling unable to speak Sal puts a hand on his
shoulder Doc goes into his arms Sal holds him awkwardly
These men are not used to hugs He pats his back

Doc
Sal he dont have a face
anymore

All Sal can offer is the universal spine stiffener Gods
blessing and curse combined

SAL
Gotta be a man

Doc nods into his shoulder and stands back running a
handkerchief over his face Sal takes a moment to stare down
the Colonel

SAL (CONTD)

Howd this boy wind up dead
mister

( )

MUELLER
Sal

COLONEL WILLITS
I beg your pardon

SAL
Simple question Howd it happen

COLONEL WILLITS
The Lance Corporal acquitted
himself with dignity and honor and
he died a hero

SAL
Yeah well theyre all heroes
aint they

COLONEL WILLITS
That they are sir

SAL
All heroes for sure But how did
it happen that he was shot in the
back of his head like a fuckin
dog

Doc looks at the uneasy Colonel through teary eyes

COLONEL WILLITS
He was a brave Marine a credit to
the corps and he served his
country well

SAL
So did we all - all of us here And
we still have to when we get the
chance

DOC
Whats going on Sal

SAL

COLONEL WILLITS
With all due respect thats none
of your business

SAL
With all due respect Doc here

Washington hesitates glances at the Colonel staring at him
but then reluctantly answers

WASHINGTON
I was there sir

The Colonel doesnt like how this is going at all but its
too late

COLONEL WILLITS
Very well Lance Corporal
Washington tell him what happened

Washington takes a deep breath

LATER - Sal is at the coffee table Mueller approaches from5
the hangar door Doc is leaning back against the coffin
considering what to do The Colonel and Washington stand on

either side of him

MUELLER

Sal sees the Colonel once again approaching Doc so he wanders
over to him

SAL (CONT’D)
Yo Doc

Doc looks up

SAL (CONTD)

Doc stands up straight looks the Colonel in the eye

DOC

COLONEL WILLITS
He qualifies and he deserves that
honor

Doc digs out his wallet rifles through it and produces a
photo of his son He holds it out in front of the Colonels
face

DOC

Here this is what his face looked
like He was a good-looking boy

(shows the photo to the

others )
See The high school girls were all
over him He was a good-looking
boy Im taking Larry home

COLONEL WILLITS
I assure you that is a bad decision
and you will come to regret it

Doc tries to push the cart Sal hands his cup to Mueller and
joins him They push together

COLONEL WILLITS (CONTD)
Hold on The Marines will transport
the body at no cost to you
anywhere you choose

They keep on pushing

( )

COLONEL WILLITS (CONTD)
Gentlemen I cannot release the
Lance Corporals body except to a
licensed mortician

Mueller steps up

MUELLER
Or to a clergyman isnt that the
case

The Colonel hesitates as Mueller hands him Sals cup and
begins to put on his clerical collar

COLONEL WILLITS
Correct

MUELLER
So I guess that would be me

Using his cane Mueller walks behind Doc and Sal as they push
the coffin Washington stands next to the Colonel impressed

EXT HANGAR PARKING LOT - MORNING 26

Sal and Doc push the cart Mueller trailing behind They come
to a stop not before dinging the car

DOC

They stand silently awkwardly for a moment What now

MUELLER

COLONEL WILLITS (CONTD)
I hope given further time for
reflection that you can see that

foreign and hostile land doing the
decent thing He deserves to lie
beneath the sacred soil of
Arlington He would want that I
urge you to choose that for him

home and bury him in New Hampshire
