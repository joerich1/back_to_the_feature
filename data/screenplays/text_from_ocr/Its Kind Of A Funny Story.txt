Craig

Craig looks behind him to find his mother (LYNN early 40s)
father (GEORGE mid 40s) and little sister (ALYSSA 8) all
standing by his bike

LYNN
What were you planning to do with your
bike honey

CRAIG
I don’t care about my bike I’m
killing myself

GEORGE
But we spent a lot of money on that
bike Sport We only ask that you take
care of it

ALYSSA
Think of me Craig I might want that
bike when I grow up
CRAIG
I’m sorry I just didn’t think--

LYNN
That’s right honey you weren’t
thinking of us when you decided to do
this were you

GEORGE
Pretty selfish I’d say Have you
thought about how this might affect
your sister

ALYSSA
I’1l be traumatized for life

Craig stares at his family for a beat

CRAIG
I’m sorry I--

A CAR HORN BLARES and Craig flinches blinded by the oncoming
headlights He loses his footing on the thin metal plank
He SLIPS AND FALLS as his family watches in horror

CRAIG’S POV hurling down toward the water below At the
moment before impact the frame FREEZES a few feet above the
water-—
CRAIG (VO)
This is the moment where I usually wake
up in a sweaty panic
ANGLE ON CRAIG’S anguished face frozen in time
CRAIG (VO)
But for some reason this time was
different--

The POV frame resumes action and Craig plunges into the
water

TITLE “IT’S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY”

EXT ARGENON HOSPITAL - DAWN

Craig locks his bike to a rack in front of an illuminated
emergency room sign He turns towards the hospital

Overhead the sky is illuminated by a pre-dawn glow

SUPER “SUNDAY DAY 1”
INT EMERGENCY ROOM

Craig wanders into the bright fluorescent-lit room
approaches the NURSE at the registration desk

CRAIG
Hi I want to kill myself

Unphased the nurse hands him a clipboard

NURSE
Fill this out please

INT EMERGENCY ROOM WAITING AREA - NOT MUCH LATER

Craig waits near an ear-infected KID when his attention
shifts to the sliding doors A man dressed in blue doctor’s
scrubs saunters in with a cup of coffee takes a seat
(unusually close) next to Craig He is BOBBY (late 30s semi-
balding)

Craig does his best to ignore him until

BOBBY
Hey

Craig turns to him Upon closer inspection he appears a bit
too disheveled to be a doctor or nurse He looks at Craig
with an unhinged intensity

BOBBY
You gotta cigarette

CRAIG
Uh no Sorry

BOBBY
What’s wrong with you

CRAIG
I just don’t smoke

BOBBY
No I mean why are you in the ER at
five o’clock on a Sunday morning

CRAIG
(hesitant )
Well um there’s been a lot going on
in my head lately

BOBBY
Go on
CRAIG
Okay well um I don’t really know
how to describe it Like there’s a
girl

BOBBY

BOBBY
--Why would you want to spend your
summer in school

Craig stares at Bobby for a beat
BOBBY
You should be at Coney Island bird
dogging chicks on the beach

CRAIG
Are you a doctor

BOBBY
What do you think

CRAIG
You don’t really seem like a doctor

BOBBY
Ever heard of Doogie Howser

Craig stares at Bobby trying to make sense of the question
BOBBY
(standing up)
I hope they fix whatever’s wrong with
you

CRAIG
Thanks

Bobby stalks off disappears around a corner
INT ER DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER

DR ISAIAH MAHMOUD an ER resident (Indian early 30s)
takes Craig’s blood pressure

DR MAHMOUD
How long have you been feeling
suicidal

CRAIG
I don’t know I’ve been depressed
for about a year now Thought about it
a few times but never like this
Never so real

DR MAHMOUD
Did anything specific happen today that
might have triggered these feelings

Slight PUSH IN on Craig

CRAIG (VO)
Sometimes I wish I had an easy answer
for why I’m depressed My father beat
me Or I was sexually abused But
none of that stuff has ever happened to
me It was just a normal Saturday

INT AARON’S BEDROOM - EARLIER THAT DAY

Craig and his friends lounge around the room listening to
Aaron’s record collection There is AARON (not particularly
good-looking but supremely self-confident) his girlfriend
NIA (an ultra-hip tightly-clad cutie) RONNY (a 1990s hip-
hop throwback) and SCUGGS (jew-fro)

Ronny coughs exhaling smoke and passes a joint to Aaron
who cuddles next to Nia on the bed Everyone talks
animatedly except for Craig who stares at Nia longingly

RONNY
He practically had to strip search me
to find it Its like dude youre a
security guard at a rock concert Why
are you taking your job so seriously

NIA
He probably just wanted some free weed

AARON
How much did they get
RONNY
An eighth But it was worth it APW
was the bomb

AARON
It was pretty jokes But oh-eight was
off the hook

CRAIG
I need to go

AARON
What-- you’re leaving I didn’t even
play Saucerful of Secrets yet

CRAIG
Yeah I just

SCUGGS
Don’t bug Craig He’s in the Craig
zone

RONNY

They all laugh Craig forces a chuckle
EXT BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Craig rides his bike over the bridge stops to answer his
phone

INT AARON’S BEDROOM - DAY
Nia playfully pushes Aaron off her

NIA
Hey Craig I forgot to ask you to

parents call or whatever

CRAIG
Oh You’re staying over Aarons

NIA

LYNN

(with Dr Mahmoud’s voice)
Craig Anything you can think of that

INT ARGENON HOSPITAL - ER DOCTOR’S OFFICE - PRESENT
Dr Mahmoud waits for an answer

CRAIG
Um no Nothing unusual

DR MAHMOUD

CRAIG
Zoloft But I stopped

DR MAHMOUD
Did your doctor take you off the
medication

CRAIG
No I just stopped on my own

DR MAHMOUD
Oh you shouldn’t do that

CRAIG
Yeah I know
DR MAHMOUD
Do your parents know where you are

Craig shakes his head

DR MAHMOUD
Well Craig you don’t seem to be in
immediate danger to yourself so I
think we should call your parents tell
them what happened and refer you to
one of our out-patient services

CRAIG
But I need help now The hotline said
youd help me

DR MAHMOUD
I understand you’re upset but the
people we admit to the hospital are
very sick

CRAIG
I am too Can’t you like give me
something

DR MAHMOUD
Not without parental consent Look
this is serious business Craig We
very rarely take in patients your age
I think it would be best if we tried to
handle this without--

CRAIG
Okay maybe Im not explaining right
how serious See my school is really--
and not just my school-- its like I
throw up sometimes because everything
feels like its building up And
everyone else seems like theyre
totally handling everything-- like my
friends right Aaron and Nia--
They’re both so But not me I like
sweat all the time Im sweating now
arent I

Craig wipes his forehead catches his breath

CRAIG
You know what I mean

Dr Mahmoud doesn’t move
CRAIG
I’m scared okay I can’t go back out
there I don’t know what I might
do something I just need some help
Please I need you to help me

Dr Mahmoud stares at Craig concerned He thinks it over
INSERT Dr Mahmoud signs the admittance form

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

We follow NURSE SMITTY a thin bearded hippy-looking dude in
blue jeans as he leads Craig off the elevator Craig
notices a sign on the wall reading ADULT PSYCHIATRIC with an
arrow pointing to the right

Smitty leads Craig towards a set of heavy double doors
labeled THREE NORTH Smitty flashes his ID and the Three
North SECURITY GUARD buzzes them inside

After they pass through the threshold the doors shut and
the lock echoes through the corridors

ON CRAIG peering over his shoulder at the prison-like metal
doors

INT THREE NORTH REGISTRATION OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

A cute West-Indian Nurse MONICA sips coffee behind the
desk Nurse Smitty shuffles papers nearby

MONICA
Welcome to Three North Craig Let’s
go over some rules First rule of
Three North we do NOT talk about
Three North

This grabs Craig’s attention Smitty cracks up

MONICA
Just kidding

SMITTY

Craig forces a smile

CRAIG
What exactly is Three North

MONICA
Our adult psychiatric floor
CRAIG
Oh but I’m only sixteen

MONICA
Our teen floor is undergoing
renovations so all teens are here with
the adults

CRAIG
Oh

MONICA
And you’1ll be expected to act like one
while you’re with us

Craig nods

MONICA
So starting tomorrow you’ll be
following the schedule and
participating in the group activities

She hands Craig a sheet of paper

MONICA
Our floor has a point system whereby
patients get privileges for
participating in activities and meals
and lose privileges for non-
participation andor acting out

INSERT A schedule outlining the hour-by-hour itinerary for
the week Includes things like BREAKFAST VITALS THERAPY
(GP 1) ARTS and CRAFTS BINGO LUNCH

family and they can bring over a
change of clothes toothbrush that

CRAIG
Um well I don’t think I’1l be here

Monica and Smitty exchange knowing glances

MONICA
You’ll have to discuss that with Doctor

knife Keys
Craig hands her his keys

MONICA
Good We’1ll need your cell phone and
belt too And your shoe laces

Craig hands over his phone and watches as Monica seals it
inside a plastic bag with his keys and shoelaces

INT THREE NORTH - EAST CORRIDOR

Smitty leads Craig (minus shoelaces) down the hall They
pass several other PATIENTS including a TWEAKED-OUT MAN
wearing an oversized Backstreet Boys t-shirt He makes a
ZAPPING noise in Craig’s direction

Smitty spots a woman in a professional skirt suit
approaching She is DR EDEN MINERVA (late 40s) the staff
psychiatrist

SMITTY
Hey Dr Minerva

DR MINERVA

Gilner

DR MINERVA

Smitty and Craig continue down the hall where a patient
JIMMY smiles to Craig He has one tooth

JIMMY

SMITTY
Good morning Jimmy
Craig nervously steps past Jimmy

CRAIG
What was that about
SMITTY
Jimmy’s schizophrenic
CRAIG

like me
SMITTY

We have all kinds of patients here
(calling OS)
Bobby my man

Camera TRACKS IN on BOBBY-- the same guy who sat next to
Craig in the ER As he glides down the hall in SLOW-MO
Craig gets a better look at him No longer wearing doctors’

scrubs Bobby sports a well-worn grey wool sweater
set eyes and rough edges betray a hard-lived past

SMITTY
How ‘bout a tour for our new friend
Craig here

BOBBY
Sure thing babe

SMITTY

up your room See you guys ina jiff

Smitty splits and Craig follows Bobby

BOBBY
What’s a jiff

CRAIG
A jiff

BOBBY

This guy Smitty is always like “Do
this in a jiff that in a jiff”

CRAIG
I think it just means like a short
period of time

Bobby doesn’t seem to care about Craig’s answer

CRAIG
So is this like a mental ward
BOBBY
Not a ward a hospital

They turn a corner out of sight
INT DINING ROOMREC ROOM

or so PATIENTS are scattered about

BOBBY
We spend a lot of time in here Right

situation rec room area is over there
They got a record player but
everything’s scratched

Craig notices a ping-pong table by the windows

BOBBY
Folks play table tennis sometimes Did
they tell you about the points

CRAIG
For ping-pong

BOBBY
Some people call it ping-pong but I
think that trivializes the sport

Craig nods

BOBBY
But I’m talking about the other points
You need’m for privileges like hanging
in the rec room trips to the gift
shop shit like that

Craig makes eye contact with a white-bearded guy ROGER who
appears to stare straight through Craig into another
dimension

BOBBY
Hey man if you’re really interested
you can join them

CRAIG
Join them Uh no I’m cool thanks

BOBBY
Cool Craig Copy that Let’s move
INT HALLWAY- OUTSIDE THE SHOWER ROOM
Bobby points out a sliding latch on the door

BOBBY
Okay this is the shower It doesn’t
have a lock see So when you’re

Bobby slides the latch back and forth alternately revealing
VACANT and OCCUPIED

CRAIG

BOBBY
Sure babe but nobody else does so

scrubbin’ your nuts

Craig cracks a smile follows Bobby down the hall
INT NORTH CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

BOBBY
This is where you call people-- if you
got people Or they can call you too

Bobby gestures to the TV room behind a glass window

BOBBY
TV room is here

INT TV ROOM

Craig notices a teenage girl wearing an Iggy Pop t-
shirt seated at a table in the corner She is NOELLE She
glances up from her notebook revealing several scars from
cuts on her face Craig stares at her for a beat too long

NOELLE
(alarmed)
Oh my God Are you okay
Craig quickly checks himself but can’t find anything wrong
He looks back to Noelle who shoots him a subtle grin and
gets back to her notebook

Bobby cracks up leads Craig away

INT NORTH CORRIDOR

CRAIG

BOBBY
Noelle One of the teens Did they
tell you about the renovations

CRAIG

Bobby shoots Craig a crooked smile

CRAIG
So what do you do here exactly

BOBBY
Same thing you do

CRAIG
Youre a patient What were you doing
in the emergency room this morning

BOBBY
The ER has the best coffee

CRAIG
They just let you out

Bobby smiles puts his finger to his lips makes a shushing
sound
CRAIG

Bobby hesitates and Craig senses the inappropriateness of
the question

CRAIG
Uh Sorry

Bobby stares at Craig sizes him up
BOBBY
Bet your room’s ready Let’s find
Smitty
INT THREE NORTH PATIENT’S ROOM - DAY

The light flicks on to reveal a man burrowed under bed covers
in the corner

SMITTY
Muqtada it’s almost lunch Wake up

MUQTADA a gray-bearded Egyptian man doesn’t move

CRAIG
Hey

No response
SMITTY
(quietly to Craig)
Don’t take it personal He doesn’t
talk much and he’s never left the
room Okay guys lunch in five

Smitty exits and Craig sits at the edge of his bed

CRAIG
What do they have for lunch

Muqtada grumbles something incomprehensible

CRAIG
I’m sorry
Mugtada takes the blanket and puts it over his head Craig
surveys the room This isn’t quite what he had in mind when
he asked for help

After an uncomfortable beat he goes to the door
MUQTADA
Please turn out light

Craig obliges leaves the room
INT THREE NORTH - EAST CORRIDOR

Craig accosts Dr Minerva who is now doing rounds with a
staff of INTERNS

CRAIG
Dr Minerva Look I’m uh
(faking casual)
I’m feeling much better now I was
feeling bad this morning but I think
I’m okay now So um you know Id
like to go home If that’s cool

Dr Minerva leafs through papers on her clipboard finds
Craig’s form

DR MINERVA
It says here you’re suicidal and asked
to be admitted

CRAIG
I thought you guys would be able to do
something quick Like give me some
medication to make me feel better I
didn’t think I’d be committed I
really don’t think I belong here

DR MINERVA
A lot of patients feel that way at
first Just give it a little time

CRAIG
How little

DR MINERVA
Five days

CRAIG
Five days

DR MINERVA
Definitely not more than thirty We’1ll
have an evaluation to see if you’re
ready to leave Thursday

CRAIG
But I can’t be here until Thursday
I‘1l miss school My friends will find
out where I am
DR MINERVA
It’s nothing to be ashamed of Craig
Depression is a medical illness If
you were diabetic would you be
embarrassed by that

CRAIG
Well can I at least talk to my mom
about this before--

DR MINERVA
Of course Craig I just spoke with
her myself and she’s very anxious to
see you

Dr Minerva nods and smiles to someone behind Craig then
drifts away

LYNN (0S)
Craig

Craig turns to find his mom running at him followed by George
and Alyssa She nearly tackles him with a hug and we FREEZE-

CRAIG (VO)
Don’t blame my parents for how messed
up I am Okay so my dad works too
much

ANGLE ON George frozen in time messaging on his Blackberry

CRAIG (VO)
And my mom’s a little out of touch

ANGLE ON Lynn her face oddly contorted as she hugs Craig

CRAIG (VO)
And my sister’s some kind of child
genius

ANGLE ON Alyssa staring straight ahead without emotion

CRAIG (VO)
But it’s not like I was never hugged as
a child or anything In fact they’ve
been pretty supportive through all
this They’re always on the lookout
for new ways to fix me

The following sequence presents the various ways they’ve
tried to fix him in the past Craig maintains the same
deadpan expression throughout

time but we had no idea you were

CRAIG
You are

LYNN

This is the bravest thing you’ve ever
done You made the right decision
coming here

CRAIG
Oh really Because I was kind of
having second thoughts

LYNN
We talked to the doctor and they need
to keep you here for a few days For
observation I think it’s a good idea

CRAIG
But I don’t think you understand Some
of the people here are seriously messed
up Like I don’t think my roommate’s
left the room in weeks
GEORGE
What did you expect It is a mental
ward

LYNN
George

CRAIG
It’s not a ward It’s a hospital

LYNN
It’s just five days honey

CRAIG
They told me AT LEAST five

LYNN
Well we thought it was best to leave
it up to the doctor’s discretion I
mean weve tried but These people
are professionals They know how to
help you in ways well that maybe we
can’t

Craig watches Lynn as she takes a deep breath trying hard to
hold herself together

LYNN
It seems like a nice place Right
George

GEORGE

Yeah when can I join

ALYSSA
Me too Can I stay too

LYNN
We can visit honey

CRAIG
They took my cell phone so some people
might try to call the house Please

Lynn nods hands Craig a small duffel bag

LYNN
Here are some clothes and toiletries
Let us know if you need anything else

GEORGE
And I brought this in case you have

need it anymore

DR MINERVA

something in the file

breakfast burrito Johnny

JOHNNY
It was between Bobby and Humble Ask
them

I was just interested in hearing it
from an impartial observer

JOHNNY
Well if you want my opinion I think
Bobby’s been on edge because of his

your feelings private but you should

homeless if you don’t accept me

Craig stares at Bobby not sure where to go from here

CRAIG
Okay good I think you’re ready

BOBBY
Really I didn’t sound too desperate
CRAIG
No it was very sincere But maybe
you could try to focus on the positive
things you would get from the
experience rather than you know

BOBBY
The negative

CRAIG
Exactly Like what do you think you
can bring to the home Something
special only you can offer

Bobby thinks hard
CRAIG

It can be anything Maybe you have a
great attitude

BOBBY
(shakes his head)

No
CRAIG

You always clean up after yourself
BOBBY

Not really
CRAIG

You know what I think maybe sometimes
in these situations it’s okay to bend
the truth a little

BOBBY
I wouldn’t want to raise anyone’s
expectations and then disappoint them

CRAIG
That’s it You’re pragmatic Right
there That’s what you tell them

BOBBY
(smiles )
Yeah

awed by his mastery of women when

Noelle approaches Craig plays it cool as she takes a
seat next to him

NOELLE

NOELLE
Good I thought I mighta scared you

out of her bunched up sleeve Seeing this Noelle subtly
pulls her sleeves over her palms

CRAIG
I checked myself in I guess Kinda by
accident The suicide hotline said to
come Why are you here so long

NOELLE
They think I might cut myself again
Why’d you call the suicide hotline

CRAIG
I guess because I didn’t actually want
to kill myself even though I kind of
did Does that make sense

Noelle nods

NOELLE
So why did you kind of want to kill
yourself

CRAIG
Depression stress Have you ever

heard of the Franklin Gates University--

observes nearby Johnny lingers just outside the room

WOMAN
What’s the matter with you

BOBBY
Please lower your voice

WOMAN
How can you let your child see you like
this What kind of father are you

Bobby stares at his daughter across the table She can’t
look him in the eyes
WOMAN
I swear it’d be better for her if you
were dead But you can’t even get that
right

Smitty hurries into the room with Solomon following after

Excuse me Miss you’re going to have
to leave now

but Bobby puts on another smile

the borrowed shirt on his head like a turban He looks
totally dejected

Craig watches as Bobby tumbles onto the couch and SCREAMS
into a pillow at full volume He thrashes around on the
couch like a child having a temper tantrum

makes eye contact with Craig Hold as Bobby’s breathing
steadies Nobody moves

something like “Lord grant me the

can’t and the wisdom to know the
difference”
CRAIG
So

INT TV ROOM - DAY

Craig draws a series of brain maps while his Gates
application remains untouched at the edge of the table He
appears focused at peace

After a few moments Craig hears a familiar voice

NIA (0S)
Hey Craig

Craig’s attention jerks to the door where Nia strolls in
His mood suddenly shifts from peaceful to anxious He self-
consciously covers his art

CRAIG

Hey this is a surprise
NIA

Aaron and I broke up
CRAIG

Oh I’m sorry

Nia sits down next to him She’s wearing a little beige
camouflage skirt and Craig is suddenly hypnotized by her
thighs which we slowly ZOOM IN on

NIA

Craig shifts uncomfortably in his seat trying to conceal his
boner

CRAIG
Oh yeah Um sorry

expression

CRAIG (VO)
Okay so I know I should be thinking
about Noelle and how I’m supposed to be
meeting her in twenty minutes

ECUs ON various parts of Nia’s face eyes ears lips

CRAIG (VO)
But when you’ve got a really gorgeous
girl in front of you and you’ve been
obsessing over her for two years and
she’s biting her lip and talking low-
and you’re hard- what are you gonna do

Back to Craig as the frame resumes action

seems to be gone He places his artwork on the nightstand
covers it with the blank Gates application

NIA

CRAIG
What Oh

But before he can respond Nia advances toward him A brief
pause They look each other over and then go at it like
teenagers falling back onto Muqtada’s bed Nia straddles
over Craig

As they kiss Craig reaches up Nia’s shirt She moans
Craig awkwardly moves his hand from one breast to the other

NIA
Me and Aaron never did anything like

how upset she looks

CRAIG

Nia continues down the hall as Noelle crumples her sketch
flings it at Craig then takes off in the opposite direction

CRAIG
Thanks for coming

No response

CRAIG
So I just wanted to say I’m really

girlfriend I’ve been obsessed with
her forever--

Noelle stares at him waiting for what’s next Craig thinks
it over

After a confused beat Noelle turns to go but Craig grabs
her arm

hot And I do want to say the right
thing but only because I really like
you I like that you don’t hide your
problems like everyone else That you
wear them right there on your face
And I feel like I don’t have to hide
mine when I’m with you

Noelle manages a subtle smile Encouraged Craig continues
CRAIG
I’ve been thinking a lot and I
realized you know that well if
you’re not busy being born then you’re
busy dying and I think we could both
benefit from being born again Not

After a beat a commotion erupts from the opposite end of the
hall as Bobby streaks naked through the corridor howling
like a mad man The nurses leave their station to help
contain him

snatches a pair of scrubs They run off sneaking through
the emergency exit

Bobby notices Craig and Noelle escape then stops running
He smiles as the nurses lead him away

DR MINERVA
How are you feeling

CRAIG
I was having kind of a bad day I
missed dinner and breakfast

DR MINERVA
Why

CRAIG
I think I was probably just feeling
scared about leaving
DR MINERVA
What scares you about leaving

CRAIG
There are a lot more things to stress
about on the outside

DR MINERVA
Are you still having suicidal thoughts

Craig shakes his head no

CRAIG
It’s like there are so many people
not just in this hospital but in the
whole world ya know who are
struggling so hard to live And it
seems like self-indulgent for me not
to appreciate what I have

DR MINERVA

Like what

CRAIG
Well there’s my family my home
and my friends This girl You know
Noelle

Dr Minerva raises her eyebrows

DR MINERVA
Noelle She’s the spunky one

Craig blushes slightly Did she just call his girlfriend
“spunky”

CRAIG
Oh and this

Craig reaches into his pocket unfolds one of his brain maps
CRAIG
I always thought art was just bourgeois
decadence but

He hands the drawing to Dr Minerva who looks it over

DR MINERVA
It’s really wonderful Craig

CRAIG
Thanks I did about twenty of them
It’s something I really enjoy
DR MINERVA
What do you enjoy about it

multiple choice section and a personal
essay explaining why we should let you
go

Craig stares at Dr Minerva in shock

DR MINERVA
What Doctors can’t make jokes too

Craig exhales in relief

DR MINERVA
You can leave first thing in the
morning

CRAIG

help but you really stress me out
sometimes And that’s part of the
reason I’m here

George takes this in After a beat
