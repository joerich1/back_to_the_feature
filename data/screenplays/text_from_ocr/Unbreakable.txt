They watch her
with quiet smiles

A fourth SALESWOMAN arrives ushering in the man with the shopping

He feels a stare He looks up to find a girl six or seven years old
peering at
him from over the seat in front of him She just gazes at him blankly

He gives her a small forced smile She doesnt react David returns
his head to
the window

His eyes begin to shut with the lulling movement of the train

He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger

He looks out the window The scenery blurs as it flies by Beat

realize the
train is picking up speed

The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified

FADE TO BLACK
EXT FAIR - DAY
LEGEND 1969

A hazy afternoon A fair has come into town They have set up in the
vast parking
lot of the local high school

A line of women has formed in front of the portable bathrooms

The striking African American woman we saw giving birth is now
standing in line
She is older and somehow more beautiful

She stands with a skinny almost ethereal looking African American

boy The boy

wears a metal brace on his leg THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ELIJAH holds two
oversized

stuffed animals in his arms He looks back over his shoulder as THE
SOUND OF

VOICES YELLING IN EXCITEMENT FILL THE AIR His eyes dance over the

many colorful

rides in the parking lot

The door opens to one of the portable bathrooms A woman steps out
Elijahs mother touches his head and enters the three foot square
plastic
bathroom She turns back and gives him a look

MOTHER
Well play the water pistol
game next

Elijah nods Yes happily

The mother closes the cubicle door Elijah is left alone amongst the
line of

women They stare at him blankly Their eyes moves over his leg brace
Elijah

doesnt like it He moves away from the line

A CRESCENDO OF CHEERS RISES IN THE AIR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE FAIR
Elijah follows

the voices He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of
people CLICK

CLICK CLICK His metal brace sounds as he walks

For a moment he sees nothing but bodies all around him
He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile

A man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves
them in

Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile The
Hurricane

He watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like
seat They pull
the metal bars down in front of them

The man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile

Elijah stares up at the multi-colored sign Beat He moves quickly
Ducks under
the turnstile and climbs onto the platform

Elijah finds and empty circular seat He slips inside the gray metal
compartment
and sits He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him

He looks around at all the excited faces His eyes fill with
excitement too

His small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the
compartment His
expression changes
Elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms He presses them to
check their

softness He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the
seat Hes

wedged in between them Feels good

He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him
Elijah
looks a little anxious Beat

He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar It goes around
twice before
he ties the arms together He checks its softness

Elijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in He
smiles an
eight year old smile of pride

AND THEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHERS VOICE

He searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people He
hears her
calling

MOTHER
Elijah

She moves in his direction by chance She finds herself at the
entrance to The

Hurricane ride She looks up at the sign above the turnstile Her
worried eyes

immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular
compartments

Her eyes meet Elijahs He waves Her face goes very still
A HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up
Elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running

ELIJAH
I wont get hurt momma Im
safe

HIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF
MACHINERY

The platform spins He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and
white striped
man Shes pointing at Elijah
The platform turns Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped
mans
angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him

And then the ride speeds up

The gray circular seats start to spin on their own The teenagers
CHEER

Elijahs eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face

Suddenly the ride changes directions The cup-like seats get jerked
Everyone
grabs the metal bars to hold on

Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right It
cushions him

and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other
stuffed

animal

Elijahs expression becomes tense as his compartment spins His hands
slide over
the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels

Elijah looks around a sudden panic enters his eyes

THE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE
STRIPED MEN

THE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes
directions
suddenly

Elijahs hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of
the

compartment His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact WE
HEAR

SOMETHING CRACK

TEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS
OWN

The ride spins its passengers Elijahs small face looks up at the
swirling
clouds in a mixture of agony and terror

The ride changes directions
Elijah is thrust forward He hits the rusted metal bar square against

his chest
WE HEAR MORE CRACKS
The world spins Giggles and yells fill the air Elijah slumps down
onto the
floor of the compartment

And then finally the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a
gradual
stop

THE TEENAGERS MOAN

Elijah is facing directly up at the sky The clouds now move slowly
over him

WE HEAR COMMOTION AGITATED VOICES HIS MOTHERS DESPERATE VOICE

MOTHER (os)
His bones Hes not
well

HER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM

MOTHER (oSs)
Elijah baby

Then her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in She
begins to
scream

Elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment One arm is clutching his
chest The

other is curved horrifically like an

Jerry nods to himself Looks like hes going to say something Instead
he lunges

forward and smashes a HEADBUTT to the man who spoke to him

David tackles Jerry hard and fast He drives him into the ground

Blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who took the
headbutt

The other fathers start yelling and pushing each other The remaining
security
guard calls on his walkie for assistance

David keeps Jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head lock that
holds the
mans enraged face hard into the wet surface of the field

Davids eyes are not on Jerry They gaze out onto the field where
twenty two

elementary school boys have stopped playing and are standing frozen
helmets off

rain washing over their faces They watch in horror as their parents
attack each
other on the sidelines

INT BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
WE EMERGE in a cramped sparse bedroom
LEGEND 1974

A thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling He
watches a
small black and white television in the corner of the room

WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS Elijahs mother walks into the room She looks
around for a
moment and then moves to the television Turns it off

The room GOES SILENT

ELIJAHS MOTHER
No more sitting in this
room Ive let it go on long
enough

ELIJAH
Im not going out anymore
Im not getting hurt again
This was the last time I
told you

ELIJAHS MOTHER
You cant do anything about
that You might fall between
that chair and this
television If thats what
God has planned for you
thats whats going to
happen You cant hide from
it in your room

Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen

ELIJAH
They call me Mr Glass at
school Cause I break like
glass

Elijahs face is tense Unyielding Beat
Elijahs mother says the next words in almost a whisper

ELIJAHS MOTHER
You make this decision
now to be afraid
(beat)
And youll never turn back
your whole life Youll
always be afraid

Elijahs eyes move from the television to his mother He sees the
emotion in her
face Neither says anything for a while Beat

ELIJAHS MOTHER
I got a present for you

ELIJAH
Why

ELIJAHS MOTHER
Forget why Do you want it
or not

Elijah thinks it over He nods Yes

ELIJAHS MOTHER
Well go get it then

ELIJAH
Where is it

ELIJAHS MOTHER
On a bench across the
street

Elijah looks at his mother with disbelief

ELIJAHS MOTHER
You calling me a liar

She points to the window Beat Elijah gets up and moves to the only
window in
the room
The view from his room looks out over a narrow street On the other
side of the

street is a public playground A handful of children are playing on
it

There are three benches to one side of the swings On one of them is a
THIN
PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper with a bow on it

Elijah looks to his mom who has joined him at the window

ELIJAH
Someones gonna take it

Beat

ELIJAHS MOTHER
Then you better get out
there soon

CUT TO
EXT PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON

Elijah walks across the playground Hes very wary of the other
children running
about him

He walks towards the bench with the present on it Takes a seat Puts
the package
on his lap Its flat The edges of the bend down over his thin legs

He undoes the white bow He peels off the clear tape holding the brown

paper
together He unfolds the paper Beat

Elijah stares down at the single comic book in his lap
He feels the shadow of his mother She takes a seat next to him

ELIJAHS MOTHER
I bought a whole bunch
Theyll be one of these
waiting for you every time
you want to come out here

Beat
ELIJAHS MOTHER

They said this one has a
surprise ending
Elijah looks to his mother His intelligent piercing eyes take her in
fora
moment

He looks back down at his lap He opens the first page
DISSOLVE TO
INT STORE - DAY

The same intelligent piercing eyes twenty-five years older Elijah
has grown
into a handsome regal looking man He leans on a walking stick

Hes looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall Two
figures are

depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle One figure
is

extremely muscular with a mask The other is half human half animal

MAN
This is from Fritz
Champions own library This
is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the
stands in 1968

Elijah glances at the BUSINESS MAN standing next to him and then back
to the
sketch

ELIJAH

Its a classic depiction of
good versus evil Notice the
square jaw of Slayer -
common in most comic book
heroes And the slightly
disproportionate size of
Jaguaros body to his head
This again is common but
only in villains The
thing to notice about this
piece The thing that
makes it very very
special is its realistic
depiction of its figures
When the characters
eventually made it into the
magazine they were
exaggerated as always
happens

(beat)

This is vintage
The business man rubs his face Gazes at the sketch Beat

BUSINESS MAN
Wrap it up

ELIJAH
Youve made a considerably
wise decision

Elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type
of art

gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from
comic books

BUSINESS MAN
My kids gonna go berserk

Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops
He turns

ELIJAH
Once again please

BUSINESS MAN
My son Jeb Its a gift for
him

ELIJAH
How old is Jeb

BUSINESS MAN
Four

ELIJAH
No

Elijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly

ELIJAH
No no no no no You
need to go now

BUSINESS MAN
What did I say

ELIJAH
Do you see any Telletubbies
around here Do you see

a slender plastic tag
clipped to my shirt with my
Elijahs eyes

Elijah points

The business man stares at the sketch with large eyes

Beat

name printed on it Do
you see a little Asian child
with a blank expression
sitting outside ina
mechanical helicopter that
shakes when you put a
quarter in it No
Well thats what you see at
a toy store Any you must
think this is a toy store
cause youre in here
shopping for an infant named
Jeb One of us has made a
gross error and wasted the
other persons valuable
time

pierce through the shaken man

ELIJAH
This is an art gallery my
friend This is piece of
art

at the sketch

ELIJAH
This is one of seventeen
original drawings by Fritz
Champion remaining in the
world Its value will
triple every year This
piece is to be treasured To
be cherished To be
coveted by every single one
of your banker friends that
think theyre better than
you

BUSINESS MAN
What if I kept it

ELIJAH
Im listening

BUSINESS MAN
Ill keep it in my office
room

Beat
ELIJAH
What about Jeb

BUSINESS MAN
I have a lock on the door

Elijah just stares

ELIJAH
Will it be near a window

BUSINESSMAN
No direct sunlight will fall
on it

Elijah eyes the man for many seconds Beat

ELIJAH
Come back in three days
Ill think about it

Elijah starts to the back He passes the front door as two customers
walk in
Elijah talks over his shoulder to them

ELIJAH
Were by appointment only

MAN
I received a card from your
store

ELIJAH
Congratulations you have a
mailbox The sale isnt
for two weeks

MAN
This one was under the
windshield of my car

Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time David Dunne
stands with
Jeremy

Elijah just stands staring for the longest time Beat He walks closer
to them
When Elijah speaks his voice has a whispery quality to it

ELIJAH
Youve never been sick
DAVID
I dont know for sure
(beat)
I dont think so

David and Elijah quietly look at each other Beat

ELIJAH
Well if this aint a riddle
worthy of the Riddler

Cut TO

EXT LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

Three chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay
window of the
store The words Limited Edition are etched in the window

David Jeremy and Elijah are seated watching the people stroll by
Elijahs cane
is on his lap

Jeremy sips a drink in a paper cup

ELIJAH

So lets get some of the
usual questions out of the
way Why am I using a cane
Raise your hand if you were
thinking that

Jeremy raises his hand

ELIJAH

I fractured my leg Its the
fifth time Ive done that
particular bone It didnt
really heal well this time

ELIJAH
Raise your hand is youre
wondering who the hell
breaks the same bone five
times

Jeremy and David raise their hands
ELIJAH

I have something called
Osteogenesis Imperfecta

Elijah stares

Beat

Its a genetic disorder I
dont make this particular
type of protein very well
and it makes my bones very
low in density very easy to
break Ive had fifty-four
breaks in my life I have
the tamest version of the
disorder Type one

(beat)
There are type two type
three and type four Type
fours dont make it very
long

(beat)
That ends our lecture on the
medical anomaly known as
Elijah Price

at his two rapt listeners

ELIJAH
How certain are you that you
havent been sick in your
life

DAVID
Seventy-five percent

ELIJAH
Seventy-five percent Thats
not nearly good enough for
me Im extremely skeptical

DAVID
Skeptical about what

ELIJAH
Your answer to my question
Its one thing to have never
been injured in your life
but to state that youve
never taken ill well thats
a whole new level

JEREMY
Dads been injured

ELIJAH
Whats he talking about
DAVID
In college A car accident

ELIJAH
Was it serious

David nods

JEREMY
He couldnt play football
anymore

Beat Elijah looks shaken

ELIJAH
I assumed because of the
train

DAVID
You assumed wrong

Elijah closes his eyes When his eyes open the life force in them has
diminished Beat

ELIJAH
Its over
(beat)
You can go now

Elijah uses his cane to get up and walk back through the doors of the
store

INT LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON
David and Jeremy enter the store Elijah leans on a walking stick

before one of
the framed sketches He gazes at it quietly

DAVID
I think you skipped a couple
steps
Elijah turns
DAVID

You forgot the Now Im
going to tell you what the
hell is going on step See
usually that comes before
the Its over Step And
it always always comes
before the You can go
Step

(beat)
What is over

ELIJAH
The life of an idea that has
lived too long in my head

David stares at Elijah impatiently

ELIJAH
There are probably only four
or five individuals in the
world who can claim more
knowledge of comics than
myself Ive spent a third
of my life in a hospital bed
with nothing else to do but
read I have studied the
form intimately I have seen
the patterns in them The
references to social and
cultural events and the
atmosphere that surrounded
them Ive come to believe
that comics are our last
link to the ancient way of
passing on history

ELIJAH
The Egyptians drew pictures
on walls about battles and
events Countries all around
the world still pass on
nowledge through pictorial

fq

forms
(beat)
believe that comics just
at their core now have a

truth They are depicting
what someone somewhere felt
or experienced Then of
course that core got chewed
up in the commercial machine
and gets jazzed up made
titillating - cartooned for
the sale rack

Elijah gazes at David

ELIJAH
Beat

Elijah points

This city has had its share
of disasters Well
publicized ones It was
around the time of that
plane crash when it first
entered my head And there
it stayed as I waited and
watched the news over the
years

(beat)
And then one day I see a
news report on a train
accident and its sole
survivor who was
miraculously unharmed

(soft)
And just like that an idea
blossoms into the flower of
possible reality

DAVID
What was your idea Elijah

ELIJAH (soft)
If there is someone like me
in the world and Im at one
end of the spectrum
Couldnt there be someone
the opposite of me at the
other end

(beat)

A person who cant be hurt
like the rest of us A kind
of person they were talking
about in those stories

at the framed comic sketches

ELIJAH (soft)
A person they believed was
put here to protect the rest
of us Guard us

JEREMY
You thought my dad was a
real-

DAVID
Jeremy dont take another
sip of that drink
Jeremy looks down at the paper cup in his hands

DAVID
Throw it in the trashcan
near the door and wait for
me outside Do it now
please

David waits for Jeremy to exit the store Beat

DAVID
At the church You were
following me werent you

ELIJAH
Technically no I gambled
that you would attend the
church service I just
waited for you

David glares at Elijah

DAVID
Whats this about This is
obviously some scam Is this
where you tell me one of
those pictures is like an
investment

ELIJAH
Youve misunderstood

DAVID
I see guys like you all the
time in my work You find
someone you think is
emotionally vulnerable and
you tell them a fantastic
story utterly convincing
and somewhere in there you
slip it in I just need
your credit card numberI
just need a small down
payment

David shakes his head He smiles out of frustration Beat

DAVID
Did you know that this
morning was the first
morning I can remember that
I didnt open my eyes and
feel that sadness Do you
know what Im talking about
That little bit of sadness
(beat)
I thought the person that
wrote that note had an
answer for me For why I
survived that train For why
my life feels so out of
balance
(beat)
But I guess thats what you
were counting on

Elijah stares carefully at David Beat David glances over to the
entrance
Jeremy watched through the window concerned

DAVID
Im going to leave now
(beat)
Good luck with your sale

Elijah watches David walk towards the front door

ELIJAH
What type of job do you have
David

David opens the door He looks back at Elijah

ELIJAH

What type of job would that
be

window as

Jeremy takes Davids hand as they cross the street

Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze

Cut TO
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
ALL LIGHTS ARE OUT EXCEPT THE SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP ON DAVIDS SIDE

David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his
hands

Jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over Davids legs
David doesnt blink as he gazes at the headline silently
TRAIN CRASH DEATH TOLL CONFIRMED AT 131 DEAD 1 SURVIVOR

Beat David slides out from under his sons legs Jeremy stirs but
doesnt wake
up

David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room He opens a
closet door

A NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as David yanks a chain David steps
inside the

narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB
DOESNT

FALL ON JEREMY

Theres just enough room to stand and look around David reaches up
and pulls a

small travel bag out of the way David stretches as he feels on the
top shelf

His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt He unwraps
it Its a
handgun

He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it
to the
highest shelf

He stretches even more Reaches farther back WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE
ON THE
SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD

He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings He opens the folder to
reveal a

young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air
victoriously The

word Champion is written over his head David flips through the top
clippings

- all are images and stories of David and football
He turns the pile over Goes to the last clipping This piece of paper

is folded
over three times unlike the others He opens it

Its a newspaper headline It reads

CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED

David puts the new headline next to the old one They look like a

set Even the
font is similar

David stares at the old headline Stares hard at the photo of the bent

and

heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway

The bulb
seems to flicker David is utterly still

SOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR David gets startled

He puts back the clippings Stuffing the new one inside with them He

replaces it
back to the top shelf and leaves the closet

ANOTHER SOFT SET OF KNOCKS as David moves across the bedroom

Megan stands in the darkened hall Beat

DAVID (whisper)

Megan nods Beat

MEGAN (whisper)

DAVID (whisper)
Oh

MEGAN (whisper)
Let me just ask you
something okay And you can
be totally honest Im
prepared for any answer It
wont affect me

David nods yes

MEGAN (whisper)

He opens

problems The answer wont
affect me

Beat David stares at his wife

MEGAN (whisper)
It wont affect me either
way

Beat David doesnt say anything He just nods No

Megans face starts to tremble She starts crying Tears roll over her
very

affected face She tries to wipe them away but theres too many
Beat

MEGAN (soft)

-My decision is Id

(beat)
Its a big deal you walked
away from that train Its

okay

watches her
disappear into the shadows

The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles
paraphernalia A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David
reads as he

tilts his head sideways We sleep with quarterbacks is written in

wearing an eagles uniform

The WALKIE TALKIE on Davids hip bursts to life He pulls it off his
hip an

ELIJAH
Weve already begun

David looks around

DAVID
One more time What is it
Beat

ELIJAH
Why is it do you think
that of all the professions
in the world you chose
protection

DAVID
Are you for real

ELIJAH
You could have poured coffee
in Starbucks you could have
learned to install track
lighting in office
buildings you could have
told people their horoscopes

on the internet You could
have been one of ten
thousand things but in

the end you chose to
protect people You made

that decision and I find
that very very interesting
(beat)

Now all I need is your
credit card number

Beat Elijah smiles

ELIJAH
That last part was a joke

David fights it But he smiles anyway Beat

DAVID
I got this job because my
college coach called the guy
who manages the stadium
Theres no hidden meaning to
it

Davids walkie makes NOIES on his hip

David and Elijah move along the line towards the turnstiles

DAVID
It gets heaviest ten minutes
before kickoff

David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket David looks backs at
him and
continues walking

David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles

DAVID
Why dont we pat down

David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd Elijah
moves next to
him

DAVID
Just give me a minute

ELIJAH
Is there a problem

DAVID
That guy in green Sometimes
people carry weapons in
here Then they drink too
much Theyre team isnt
doing so well bad things
happen We do random pat
downs of the crowd to
discourage people from
carrying
(beat)
If hes carrying hell step
out of line

Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move
through
the turnstiles
The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line His face is
blank as he

watches the pat down ahead of him Hes twenty people from the
turnsstile

David eyes him Fifteen people away Ten

The man coughs and steps out of the line Elijah watches the green
army jacket

melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away
from the

stadium

CUT TO
INT STADIUM TUNNEL - AFTERNOON

AN UNLIT arched concrete passageway The SUNLIGHT from the stadium
streams in
causing long shadows

Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself

THE THUNDEROUS CHEERS OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND FANS IN THE STADIUM ECHOES
FROM THE
FIELD INTO THE TUNNEL

David enters the tunnel and joins Elijah He hands him a ticket

DAVID
I got you a seat in the
seven hundred level
(points straight up)
Its nose-bleed territory
but at least you wont get
spit on

ELIJAH
How did you know that man
you bumped was carrying a
weapon

DAVID
Probably the army jacket
Those guys carry hunting
knives and stuff for show

ELIJAH
You thought he was carrying
a knife
Beat

DAVID
I thought he was carrying
something

ELIJAH

But not a knife

DAVID
I got this picture of a
silver handled gun tucked in
his pants
(beat)
Like on tv

Elijah stares at David THE STADIUM CHEERS BOUNCE OFF THE GRAY WALLS

ELIJAH
You have good instincts when
it comes to things like
that

DAVID
Like what

ELIJAH
Telling when people have
done something wrong

Beat
DAVID
Yes
ELIJAH
Have you ever tried to
develop it
DAVID
I dont know what youre
asking
ELIJAH
Youre skill
Beat
DAVID

Listen I got to be on the
sidelines during the game
You can get to your seat by
David exhales

taking the stairwell at-

ELIJAH
Characters in comic books
are often attributed special
powers X-ray vision things
of that sort

slowly as he stares at Elijah

DAVID
Okay I dont want to play
this game anymore

ELIJAH
Its an exaggeration of the
truth Maybe its based on
something as simple as
instinct Like being able to
touch someone and tell
whether theyve done
something wrong Or the
level of what theyve done
wrong

DAVID
The guy might not have been
carrying anything

ELIJAH
Or he might have been
carrying a silver handled
gun tucked in his pants

Davids WALKIE ERUPTS WITH NOISE

Beat

DAVID
I have to go now

ELIJAH
One last question

DAVID
Quick

ELIJAH
The car accident you were
in Was there anyone else
involved
The two men stand very still in the tunnel

DAVID
Yes My wife Megan She was
in the car with me

David turns and starts down the hall David talks back over his
shoulder

DAVID
Have a good life Elijah and
try to buy your tickets at
an authorized sales
location

Elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jogs down the
darkness of
the tunnel

CUT TO
INT CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

We are inside a customized car The dashboard is covered in some sort
of thin

foam padding The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding
Every

corner and hard surface has been safe guarded Elijah sits behind the
wheel of

his car in the parking lot of the stadium He sits as thoughts crash
at his head

Beat

He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car He looks into
the rearview
mirror and sees the man in the GREEN ARMY JACKET pass behind his car
Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars
heading out
of the parking lot
Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine

CUT TO
EXT PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

Elijahs walking stick makes RHYTHMIC CLICKS on the concrete parking
lot

The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every
step
Elijah starts breathing harder He pushes himself to move faster He
avoids the

hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he
quickens his

pace through the lot

He gains on the army jacket

ELIJAH(calls out)
Hold up for a second

The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that
marks the

end of the parking lot He looks back at Elijah for a beat Doesnt
like what he

sees He disappears into the subway entrance

Elijah quickens into a jog now He hasnt done this in a while and
its painful
He makes it with great strain to the subway
He looks into the entrance
A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor The tail of the
army jacket
is glimpsed before it disappears
Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing
ELIJAH(calls out)

I just want to ask you

something
Elijahs VOICE ECHOES down the stairs No response
Elijah starts his descent

THE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS

Elijah has to move fast He takes the steps with less and less
hesitation Hes
moving with great agility and then his foot catches on a step

His hand slips away from the railing
He falls down the remaining part of the stairs The FIRST SICKENING
CRACK is

heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall

The SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON
THE METAL
STAIRS

He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the
subway

landing His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE
ROAR OF

THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN

His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside
down The

green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression
pushing

through the turnstile

The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out is the tail of the
mans coat

riding up as he move through the turnstile The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN
peeks out

from the belt of his pants

Three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers One side
of the room

has benches and massage tables The far end of the room has work out
equipment

About twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the
spacious room lost
in their own pre-game rituals

David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage
table and

removes his dress shirt His body is covered in old bruises He lays
down

wincing a bit from the pain A trainer begins to massage him

David just stares at the battered athlete His gaze moves across the
room Beat

David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards
it

He moves through the room of players and trainers He moves to the one
area of
the large room not occupied by anyone

David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press Racks and
racks of
free weights sit behind the press

on either
side Six in all

standing

Some of the

players have headphones on Some are staring into space A couple are
on cell

phones

No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black
plate off

the weight rack

The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND

A matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side

And then David adds another He matches it on the other side

THE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat

No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench

Davids hands take hold of the shiny bar

He closes his eyes

Davids arms become tense He pushes against the weight It doesnt
move

His face turns deep red He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he
keeps

training His face and arms are shaking He keeps staring
focusing

And then without any fanfare the bar lifts off the arm rest

The weight hovers over David He lowers it to his chest for a second
time His
arms arent shaking anymore He pushes the weights back up

He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest It touches down with
the
smallest of CLINKS

wasnt that call it would
be a call telling me he blew
out his knee or suffered his
third concussion Ive seen
way too much of it in my

job I can barely take it
when my clients are in pain

I dont hate the game I
admire the amount of skill
it involved and like

I couldnt give him my heart

happen to him And it always
does with that game

would understand

something

Elijah wheels over to one of the framed sketches on the wall Its a

drawing of a muscular figure shielding himself from a blow about to be
delivered
A huge ominous shadow is covering him as if something unspeakable and
evil is
just out of frame

ELIJAH

Look at this I just noticed

Were you really injured in
that car accident in
college

David looks unsteady all of the sudden

ELIJAH

Because I think you faked
it I think you took the
opportunity to end your
career - no questions asked

(beat)
And I think you did it of
all things for a women

(beat)
Not only do you have the
physical traits of a hero
down somewhere in there you
have the moral code of one
too You were ready to
sacrifice everything for

drawing
whats right Where can you
find that these days

(beat)
Only thing you didnt realize
is that you were giving up
a part of yourself when you
gave up football The
physical part And you need
that part desperately to
feel balance again

You can have it back now

in his back when I bumped
him Most guns have a black

fifty-fifty shot at the

Thats not what I witnessed
David

DAVID
Stop messing with my life
Elijah My son almost shot
me last night He wanted to
prove you were right

bones broke and your mind
just broke with it

removes the

full trash bag within it He replaces it with a fresh one He throws
the full

trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it

frozen with a plate of half-eaten now moldy eggs at one setting and
two bowls of
colorful cereal in another The cereal has dissolved in the old milk
Two
cockroaches are crawling in the bowl

David gets
closer he shields his face from the strong smell He pulls the door
open

quietly

flashback lays partly in the shadow partly in the light His crumpled
tie lies

folded over itself on his still chest

CUT TO
INT FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
A BOXING MATCH BLARES ON THE TELEVISION Empty beer bottles and coke
cans sit in

a pyramid on the coffee table

David steps into the unoccupied room His movements are slow and
tense

THUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM David
looks up and

follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM

David moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE
TELEVISION

CUT TO
INT GIRLS ROOM - NIGHT
Three closed doors converge on a landing David opens the closest one
Its a young girls room Posters of boy bands are on her wall
Clothes are

everywhere The room is empty

A NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE
BEDROOM

Cut TO

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT
A slightly overweight girl probably fourteen years old is tied by her
wrists

with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom She sits
with her arms

pointed upward over her head He knees tucked up to her chest

Next to her is her younger brother A skinny boy maybe twelve Hes
tied and
seated in the same way

Their heads are leaned back against their arms Theyre completely
listless Eyes

half mast They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark
hooded

figure of David Dunne steps in His long dark slowing rain poncho
still dripping

water He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards
them

They dont react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and
unties them

Theyre arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning
over them

They boy blinks once slowly

David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood

DAVID
You need to leave now

CUT TO
INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

An exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a
clothes

hanger long ago The tv across the bed has framed family photos
displayed on

top of it

Davids shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom
on the
other side of the bedroom

A woman is tied to the bathroom door handle She sits on the tiled
floor slumped

against the door Her eyes stare blankly at the ground She has
considerable

bruises on her face and arms

David stands before her
DAVID (soft)
Where is he

The woman doesnt answer but a SOUND COMES FROM THE SCREEN DOOR
nearby The
curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside

David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain It leads to a
small balcony
An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it

David steps onto the balcony and looks down

The rain still pours down unmercifully It comes down on a black tarp
that covers
a pool in the backyard

David turns to go back inside
A BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM

The collision is sudden and explosive The huge man drives his
shoulder into

Davids chest and takes him off his feet Davids body flips over the
railing

The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories
directly
towards the black tarp

CUT TO
EXT POOL - NIGHT

David lands on his stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP onto the nylon black
tarp

Theres a thin layer of rain water on the tarps surface David is
laying on his
cheek Half his face is covered in water

Beat Davids exposed eye looks around in a daze The surface of the
tarp gets
pounded by the rain

David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp His hands sink
into the water

as his pressure pushes the tarp down

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START
David stops pushing His vision catches the corner of the swimming
pool as the
tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place

The tarp sags David becomes utterly still THE SOUND CONTINUES
ANYWAY

One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all
around the
edge of the pool

And then without warning the tarp caves in It folds around David as
he and the
tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER

CUT TO
EXT UNDER WATER - NIGHT

Davids body is tangled in the pool cover His legs and arms thrash
against the
constricting black tarp Hes drowning

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE PIERCE THE DARKNESS UNDER WATER THE
BLURRED

IMAGE OF A DISTANT FIGURE HIGH ABOVE ON A BALCONY FLICKERS AND
DISAPPEARS

The last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in
place
around the edge of the pool

The rain keeps falling

The tarp moves like its alive underwater It shifts and wraps David
tighter with
every movement

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT AGAIN TWO SMALL FIGURES NOW STAND IN A BLURRED
SILHOUETTE NEAR

THE EDGE OF THE POOL FLASHES OF SOMETHING SHINY THEYRE HOLDING A
ROD OR

POLE ITS SHAKY NEBULOUS IMAGE WAIVERS IN THE AIR ABOVE THE
SURFACE

Davids only free hand reaches for the light It catches the silver
pole

The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the
edge of the

pool Davids head and shoulders emerge from the darkness He takes
hold of the
pools edge

Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the
grasp of
the tarp He hauls himself onto the ground

He sits hunched over in a dark mass his head down under his hood The
rain
poncho covering him like a blanket Beat

He rises to his feet The water rushes off of him His breathing is
slowing
calming

He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house He turns and
looks to the
two small figures standing near the edge of the pool

The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain Theyre
holding an

aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool They stare up
at the

hooded figure

No one says anything
CUT TO
INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to
the door

handle of the bathroom His back is to us Hes drinking from a beer
bottle as he

looks down at her

He doesnt notice the third presence come into the room He doesnt
hear him move
closer Right behind him

The man in orange takes another sip of his beer not realizing an arm
is reaching
over him He doesnt get to swallow the sip in his mouth

David Dunnes powerful arm wraps around the mans thick neck Davids
hands clamp
together like and iron vise He squeezes

The mans beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get
crushed
David yanks back hard pulls the man off balance The mans legs push
back

violently sending both of them backwards across the room They come
to a hard

stop as Davids back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL

The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against
the wall
Davids arm remains locked around his throat

The man becomes frantic His face turning dark red He clutches at
Davids arm

He spins taking David with him into another wall The IMPACT IS
TREMENDOUS The

room shakes David holds on His face bent low and hidden under his
hood

And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back It lands hard
right in

Davids side David groans The huge man delivers another one Savage
desperate

blows WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVIDS BODY And David
never lets go

The elbows slow and then stop The legs of the man in orange start to
buckle

David pulls him back onto his heels He turns him in a half circle
All of his

tremendous weight is hanging from Davids arm now David LETS OUT A
YELL AS HE

APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH The mans legs stop kicking

David keeps turning him The mans body goes completely limp Davids
just

dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle
over the

carpet now

David slowly comes to a stop He stands there with his arm wrapped
around the
mans neckThe mans limbs dangle down to the ground Beat

Davids hands let go of each other His arm slips out from under the
mans jaw

The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll The only
SOUND IN THE

ROOM IS DAVIDS HEAVY BREATHING Beat

He moves to the woman slumped against the door He starts to untie the
phone
cords that bind her wrists to the handle He whispers to her
DAVID (soft)
Its over now
(beat)
Your children are fine
Theyre getting help

He unties her wrists Her arms stay above her head where they were

DAVID (soft)
Im going to go now

He stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him She sits
unnaturally

still against the door with her arms above her head The mascara that
has run

down her face and dried has tracks where countless tears have rolled
down

David moves his hand near her mouth and nose He checks for the
feeling of breath
against his hand Beat

He rises up Removes his hood David Dunne stands silently in the
master bedroom

of someones house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped
position

against her bathroom door

Megan stirs in her sleep She shifts her head on the pillow
Then her body RISES INTO THE AIR
She starts to wake as she floats across the room She opens her eyes
and sees
David close by Hes carrying her in her arms He moves up the stairs
with her
No words are spoken
CUT TO

INT THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT

They enter their bedroom David lays her down gently on her side of
the bed

She watches as he walks out of sight He lays down right behind her

He covers her with his arm His hand is shaking Beat He speaks
softly

DAVID (soft)
I had a bad dream

David tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes
Megan lays stunned in her husbands arms Beat

MEGAN (soft)
Its over now

She closes her eyes too as the tears start coming

DISSOLVE TO
EXT STREET - DAY
Downtown Philadelphia

People move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts
David Dunne is
among them

He crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition The front doors
of the
store are open

A banner over the door reads Annual Sale

CUT TO
INT LIMITED EDITION - DAY
The compact store is crowded with customers

David spots Elijah with a group of people before a framed painting of
a comic
hero

David moves to a less crowded area of the store and waits He turns
and looks at
a framed sketch

Beat An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins
David

WOMAN
See the villains eyes
Theyre larger than the
other characters They
insinuate a slightly skewed
perspective of how they see
the world Just off normal

David stares at the drawing

DAVID
He doesnt look very
threatening

WOMAN

Thats what I said to my
son He said theres always
two kinds The soldier
villain who fights the hero
with his hands and then
theres the real threat The
brilliant and evil arch
enemy who fights the hero
with his mind

David turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American
woman in her
sixties who stands next to him

DAVID
Are you Elijahs mother

The woman turns and looks at David for the first time

ELIJAHS MOTHER

ELIJAHS MOTHER

They both watch Elijah from across the room

ELIJAHS MOTHER

David watches as Elijahs mother walks across the store and waits for
Elijah to
finish talking

David turns back to the framed sketch He looks at it with his hands
in his
pockets Beat

Davids stare turns into a gaze His gaze turns into stillness

THE SKETCH is of a withered man with large tense eyes He sits in the
shadows

Hes seated in some type of machine There are lots of buttons and
levers on the

machine The machine has wheels

David turns from the sketch He looks across the room to Elijah seated
in his

wheelchair Elijahs large eyes stay focused on the customers as he
finishes

negotiating

David turns back to the sketch He looks at it with growing confusion
The more

you look at drawing the more the machine the man is seated in looks
like a

wheelchair

David looks back across the store Elijah and his mother are talking

Elijah has
spotted David

Beat Elijah starts across the crowded store towards David He wheels
up to him

ELIJAH
Did you see this

Elijah has a newspaper on his lap He holds it up

Theres a drawing on the front page Its a hooded figure shielding
two huddled

children behind him

ELIJAH (soft)
It has begun
David stares quietly at the sketch of himself

ELIJAH

Elijah looks down at the newspaper

David hesitates and then reaches forward
He reaches past the paper And TOUCHES ELIJAHS ARM
