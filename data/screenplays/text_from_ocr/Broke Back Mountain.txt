EXT HIGHWAY NIGHT NEAR DAWN) 1963 1

and cattle truck running empty tops a ridge on a lonely
western highway

To the east the first faint flush of light

Across the plain perhaps yet some twenty miles away a
sprinkle of lights like fallen stars on the vast dark plain

The truck roars on
INT TRUCK CAB NIGHT CONTINUOUS 2

It is lighter now but the light is high and the plain still
mainly dark the lights of Signal Wyoming vivid closer now
perhaps five miles ahead

Patsy Clines WALKIN AFTER MIDNIGHT on the radio The
TRUCKER inscrutable barrels on Cabin is hazy with
cigarette smoke

In profile WE SEE the passenger take an old mashed-up
Stetson off the dashboard

This is ENNIS DEL MAR not yet twenty but nonetheless
compelling not light or frivolous in disposition appearance
or manner uncommonly quick reflexes--a high-school drop-out
country boy with no prospects brought up to hard work and
privation rough-mannered rough-spoken inured to the stoic
life Has outgrown his faded denim cowboy shirt his wrists
stick well out of the sleeves the buttons gap

ENNIS
(straightens the creases of the
hat sets it on his head)
Thats Signal aint it
TRUCKER
no conversationalist)
Was the last time I come this way
ENNIS looks straight ahead at he lights
EXT MAIN STREET SIGNAL WYOMING DAY (LATER) 3
Lighter still

The truck stops with a screech of air brakes in front of a
service station just opening for the day An OLD MAN is
rolling a tractor tire as big as he is into the garage

ENNIS steps out of the truck no suitcase just a grocery
sack stuffed with his only other shirt and pair of Levis

(CORTINUED
tad

The truck moves again almost before he hits the ground
spraying him with dust

Tall raw-boned lanky possessed of a muscular supple body
made for the horse and for fighting--he stretches looks at
the OLD MAN who looks back at him sourly One of ENNISS
boot heels is worn has to adjust for the turn of the heel as
he walks

No one in sight on the streets of Signal

After a moment carrying his sack ENNIS walks over to the
OLD MAN who is balancing the tractor tire against a pillar

ENNIS
‘Scuse me Mightin you tell me where
the Farm and Ranch Employment Office is
at

OLD MAN
(not as sour as he looks
points)
In that there trailer house Three
blocks down Youll see it

ENNIS nods tips his hat starts off

OLD MAN
Dont let that goddamn Joe Aguirre send
you up to Brokeback without no thirty-
ought Theres coyotes and coyotes up
there theyll eat your damn sheep and
your damn jackass too With a thirty-
ought you might hold your own

ENNIS surprised by this torrent of words clears his throat

ENNIS
Sir

The OLD MAN kicks at the tractor tire a time or two as if
irritated it exists Looks at ENNIS

OLD MAN

Where was you raised bud
ENNIS

Uh Sage
OLD MAN

Why that aint hardly in Wyoming thats
nearly to Utah You aint a damn Mormon
are you 3

ENNIS
No sir I just never heard a no place
called Brokeback

The OLD MAN points to a long barren mountain to the north
its upper reaches miles away reaching well above the tree
line

OLD MAN
Dont you let that damn Joe Aguirre send
you up there with no twenty-two Coyotes
dont mind a twenty-two Make sure he
gives you a thirty-ought

Too much talk for ENNIS who nods his thanks
Looks up at the mountain as he walks off
EXT SIGNAL WYOMING TRAILER DAY 4

The sun is full up though it is still early A gentle
breeze whistles

ENNIS sits on the steps of a dingy trailer house a crooked
sign above the door says FARM AND RANCH EMPLOYMENT AGENCY
Smokes waits Sees an old green pickup with a bad muffler
approaching and ENNIS becomes aware that the muffler is not
the pickups only problem It coughs sputters rattles from
Several junctures as it pulls into the gravel parking lot of
the AGENCY and dies

The driver sits a moment in the drivers seat then gets out
and slams the door of the pickup in disgust looks at it much
as the OLD MAN had looked at the tractor tire

This is JACK TWIST like ENNIS a rough country boy with
little education but somewhat different in appearance and
attitude a little less stoic a little more of a dreamer
More welcoming appealing with a quick laugh Nineteen not
as tall as ENNIS more compact and muscular thick dark
hair worn jeans bullrider’s belt buckle faded shirt
stubbly beard straw cowboy hat boots worn to the quick

Doesnt notice ENNIS-the steps of the trailer house are

still in shade But when he does he stiffens a little--

looks at him--looks away

Then the two ignore one another completely

EXT SIGNAL WYOMING TRAILER DAY (LATER) 5

Eight am The wind has picked up considerably

nes

JACK attempts to shave using his rearview mirror a 25-cent
razor and water in a paper cup Painful work but keeps at
it scraping away at his stubble Pickup radio plays Johnny
Cashs “I WALK THE LINE”

An old white Buick stationwagon races along a street
congested with pickups pulling horse trailers The
stationwagon whips into the parking lot throwing dust over
JACK who hastily concludes his shaving operation The
gstationwagon stops about two feet from the steps of the
trailer office as ENNIS jumps up to get out of the way

The driver JOE AGUIRRE middle-aged stocky no fool hair
the color of cigarette ash and parted down the middle foam
dice hanging from the rearview gets out Then reaches back
in for an oversize container of coffee

JOE glares at ENNIS then JACK as he heads for the trailer
office door

Neither boy moves

JOE goes inside Door slams ENNIS sticks his big raw hands
in his pockets JACK considers checking under his hood

JOE AGUIRRE
(sticks his head out the door)
If you pair a deuces are lookin for
work I suggest you get your asses in
here pronto

ENNIS picks up his grocery sack of clothes Looks over at
JACK Heads inside

JACK follows The door forcefully slams behind them

INT TRAILER OFFICE DAY CONTINUOUS

Dusty choky little trailer office Venetian blinds hang
askew the one desk littered with papers the Bakelite
ashtray filled with butts only one chair for guests A pair
of binoculars hangs from a nail in the wall behind AGUIRRES
desk

Neither ENNIS nor JACK sits ENNIS smokes

In the background a small old black-and-white TV plays a
news story about then-President Kennedy

JOE AGUIRRE in his swivel chair gives them his point of
view

JOE stubs his cigarette in the over-full ashtray grabs a
cheap round watch on a braided cord from a box on a high
shelf winds it sets it while JACK and ENNIS look on
Tosses it to ENNIS as if hes not worth the reach

JOE AGUIRRE

postcard

It is clear ENNIS enjoys the ride the silence of the high
country Whistles

Rounds a bend--Cigar Butt balks spooks rears up startles
a small black bear in the middle of the trail who also
scared promptly runs off into the woods

ENNIS is thrown lands hard rolls on the rocky ground

Cigar Butt races off the trail pulling the two mules along
with him through the trees and the undergrowth tearing the
supply packs scattering food everywhere A bag of flour
breaks creating a white cloud

ENNIS sits up His temple is cut and bleeding profusely
blocd runs down his cheek

ENNIS gets up stiff and angry following the trail of food--
the broken bag of flour a carton of smashed eggs--to find
his horse and mules

Like vast clouds of steam from thermal springs in winter he
years of things unsaid and now unsayableadmissionrs
declarations shames guilts fears--rise around them

ENNIS stands as if heartshot face gray and deep-lined
Fights a silent battle grimaces his eyes screwing snut

knees

JACK is frightened thinks maybe its a heart attackor
else the overflow of an incendiary rage

JACK

tarts towards him but ENNIS jerks away JACK moves towards

nis feet
And then they hug one ancther a fierce desperate embrace--
managing to torque things almost to where they had been for
what theyve just said is no news nothing ended nothing
begun nothing resolved
EXT MOUNTAINS TRAILHEAD MORNING 133

ENNIS ENNISS breath comes slow and quiet then he starts
to gently rock back and forth a little lit by the warm fire
tossing ruddy chunks of light the shadow of their bodies a
single column against a rock ENNIS hums quietly

Kothing mars this moment for JACK even though he knows that
ENNIS does not embrace him face to face because he does not
want to see or feel that it is JACK he holds--because for
now they are wrapped in a closeness that satisfies some
shared and sexless hunger that is not really sleep but
something else drowsy and tranced--until ENNIS dredgirg up a
rusty phrase from the childhood time before his mother died
says

ENNIS
Time to hit the hay cowboy I got to go
(pause)
Come on now youre sleepin on your feet
like a horse

Gives JACK a little shake a gentle push and JACK stumbles
ever so slightly in the direction of nis tent Stops

Hears ENNISS spurs jingle as he mounts his horse

stone and ENNIS rides away JACK watching him go

INT TWIST HOMESTEAD HOUSE TOP OF STAIRS JACKS ROCH 152

DAY CONTINUOUS

WE SEE ENNIS at the top of a steep set of narrow stairs
entering JACKS room tiny and hot afternoon sun pouring
through the west window hitting the narrow boys bed against
the wall

WE CAN HEAR JACKS MOTHER downstairs running water filling
the kettle setting it back on the stove then hear the
husbands ard wifes meffled conversation

A window leoks down on the dirt road stretching scuththe
only road out of this Godforsaken place

A well-used desk and a wooden chair stand against the other
wall A small 22 hangs in a wooden rack over the bed

An ancient photograph of a handsome dark-haired movie star
Maximilian Schell is taped to the wall beside the bed
curled and yellowed

ENNIS ses the closet walks over to it

A shallow cavity with a wooden rod braced across it a faded
cretonne curtain on a string half-open closing the closet
off from the rest of the room In the closet hangs two pairs
of jeans crease-ironed and folded neatly over wire hangers
On the flocr a pair of worn packer boots

ENNIS looks inside te the right and WE SEE that the cioset
makes a tiny jog into the wall--a little hiding place--and
there stiff with long suspension from a nail hangs a shirt

ENNIS lifts it off the nail it’s JACK‘S old shirt from

Brokeback days dried blood on the sleeve ENNISS own blood
from their last day together on Brokeback when they were

wrestling and ENNIS slipped and JACK accidentally kneed him
in the nose

The shirt seems heavy Then ENNIS sees that there is another
shirt inside it the sleeves carefully worked down inside
JACKS shirt sleeves it is ENNISS own denim shirt lost
hed thought long ago up on Brokeback Mountain his dirty
shirt the pocket ripped buttons missing stolen by JACK arc
hidden here inside JACKS own shirt the pair like two skins
one inside the other two in one

ENNIS presses his face into the fabric and breathes in slowly
through his mouth hoping for the faintest smoke and mountain
sage anc salty sweet stink cf JACK

But there is no real scent only the memory of it which WE
SEE t0o--an image of the mountain superimposed-the
imagined power of Brokeback Mountain of which nothing is
left but what he now holds in his trembling hands
