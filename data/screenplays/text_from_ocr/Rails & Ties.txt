RAILS and TIES by Micky Levy

FADE IN

A distant whistle then softly CHCHCH A train
approaching Over the black screen in white letters

Life is like a train
Life like a train travels up hills and down valleys
Life like a train sometimes gets off track
The train like life keeps its own schedule
The train like life has a final destination
Life is like a train
Only the train departs and returns
But life oh life it never comes back
Unknown
The train sounds fade as-—-

emerges out of the orchard running his clothes covered in
leaves and dirt He chases the train and reaches for the
handrail on the side of one car sprinting with all his
might He grabs the rail and swings onto the ladder at the
back of the car

He clings to the narrow iron ladder panting and laughing
high on endorphins and youth The train as if rebelling
against his intrusion moves faster But the boy climbs and
slowly lets go of the ladder crawling onto the roof of the
freight car He lies on the warm steel raises one palm up
and up and spreads his fingers wide feeling the wind rush
through them

News and camera CREWS swarm in the peripherals recording the
irritated confused PASSENGERS who wait in long lines to
board the blue busses of California Amtrak

Yellow tape isolates the accident scene from the media The
car or the mangled piece of metal that is left of it is
still attached to the train’s grill like a deformed giant
bug DETECTIVES work around it retrieving evidence

Tom and Otis step out of one car each holding a plastic cup
with a urine sample Otis avoids looking at the mangled
Lincoln as he and Tom hand their samples to a POLICE OFFICER

TOM
Let me know if Im pregnant

The Police Officer smiles awkwardly and takes the samples
NB and OFFICIALS from the Federal Railroad Administration
mill nearby under the hot sun Tom joins them Otis stays a
few feet away

TOM
It’s a suicide No doubt about it
We followed the book The feed
recorder will tell you

NB

complicated situation

TOM
There are fifty train suicides
every year in LA alone It’s not
complicated It’s routine

Not with a woman and a young boy
involved

Some asshole puts himself in front
of a train and it’s my fault

everyone knows who Susan Smith is

who dived under my train in Oxnard

A sign reads
WELCOME TO SIMI VALLEY
Clean and lit almost homey PASSENGERS on waiting-area

benches eat read and talk Nearby Davey clutching his
train scans the fair chart One entry on it informs

“SIMI VALLEY TO LOS ANGELES 1000 ONE WAY 2000 ROUND
TRIP”

It might as well be a million His gaze wanders aimlessly
around the station when he spots his answer SHARON a
pierced tattooed teenage girl sleeping against a duffel bag
on one bench She sticks out like a stain on a Sunday suit

He moseys over and plumps down next to her or more exactly
next to her army-style boots He furtively glances over

The girl is sound asleep A wallet sticks out from her back
pocket attached to her jeans with a silver chain He inches
his way toward her wallet He checks the terrain No one
notices No one cares He gently yanks the chain pulls out
the wallet and opens it

SMACK Sharon hits his hand very awake

SHARON
Way too slow That’s your problem

Alarmed he tries to hightail it when the girl grabs his
shirt planting him firmly on the bench

DAVEY
I was only gonna borrow it

SHARON
(glib)
Sure you were gonna give it back
Think the cops will buy your story

DAVEY
Please don’t call them
(taking out the quarter
from his pocket)
Take it That’s all I have

She glances at the quarter in his hand unimpressed and lets
him go She pulis out a cigarette He’s too scared to move

SHARON
Want one

DAVEY
You can’t smoke here

SHARON
Look whos talking Tony Soprano
of Simi Valley

She lights the cigarette and finds a bag of Twinkies in her
backpack She puts it on the bench between them He slowly

reaches for it She notices the deep cut in his right hand

SHARON
What happened to your hand

He takes a Twinkie nearly swallowing it whole

DAVEY
If you give me ten dollars I’1l
send them back when I get to Los
Angeles

SHARON
What are you going there for
(he shrugs)
Come on It’s a secret Level
with me You a runaway
(he nods)
Mother or father

DAVEY
Foster home

SHARON
(grinning)
No shit Join the frickin’ club

She rises tosses the cigarette on the floor and squashes it
with her boot She traverses the short distance to the ticket
window Davey watches her while eating the other Twinkie

Sharon returns to the bench holding a ticket She hands it
to him He takes it speechless

SHARON
You welcome It’s good karma
(beat)
Well The last train leaves in
five minutes

DAVEY
I’1l pay you back

SHARON
Tell you what Send it to my
sister She’s in a foster home too
She takes out a pen from her bag

SHARON
Give me that ticket

He does -- reluctantly She scribbles an address on it and
gives it back much to Davey’s relief

SHARON
Good luck

moves behind him He freezes then quickly turns Every
tree and bush is ominous and sinister

Alonely bird lands on a branch nearby It watches him He
stares back

DAVEY

AHHH

It doesn’t move He bends picks up a small rock from the
ground and throws it at the bird

He misses by an inch but the stubborn thing won’t budge or
even flutter A shiver runs down his spine He looks
around

DAVEY
(whispering)
Mom

The bird flies away He shakes his head dismissive and
continues up the incline He settles on one spot and
carefully sits unraveling the pink pillowcase wrapped around

his hand He flinches The cloth has stuck to a deep open
wound it now removes pieces of his skin as it comes undone

Davey gets to the end of the ladder He looks down at the
tangle of wires and steel connecting his car to the next one
He steps off the ladder and onto the roof careful not to put
too much pressure on his injured right hand

Slowly he straightens himself and takes a few steps Its
scary From his vantage point he can see the gigantic station
building and more trains Docked trains resting like beached
whales on their track

He continues to walk Faster and faster He stumbles loses
his balance and almost slips off of the car Determined he
straightens up and looks ahead He runs He gets to the end
of the car - jumps

He just makes it landing hard on the adjacent car’s roof
his body slamming against the cold hard metal Victorious
he rises and looks up at the dark sky
