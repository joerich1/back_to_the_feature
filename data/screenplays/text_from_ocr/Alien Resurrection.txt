Alien Resurrection

EXT DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK

We sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars Finally she comes
into view

the USS AURIGA A massive research vessel that sits majestically
just beyond Plutos orbit

We TRACK ALONG the side of the ship and

INT AURIGA

along the silent empty corridors coming at last to a door with two
guards standing rigid in front of it Full armour powerful
shockrifles expressions empty and cold

INT MEDLAB

Along a row of screens where we see the first signs of life readouts
lights data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens

As we move ALONG them a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame
then anotherleading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a

Cryogenic tube not big enough for a human

Still TRACKING around it we glimpse inside some vague fetal mass
encased in a clear aspic-like gel

Tubes and cables a attached to the mass running out of the machine

As we still CIRCLE the shape begins to be more coherent till we can
see what might even be a face

Eyes shut tight Sleeping Dreaming
ANGLE WHEAT

A birds eyes view of a field the soft golden waves filling the screen
Sharp contrast to what we have seen before

There is a woman wandering through the field Beside her a girl seven
or eight in dingey sundress Both have black tousled hair

GIRLS VOICE

My mom always said there were no monsters -- no real ones -- but there
are

The girl stops looks around her The wheat comes all the up to her
chest and nothing else is visible as far as she see

She looks back at the woman but the woman is already more than fifty
yards away
The girls expression becomes perplexed

She slaps a bug on the back of her neck Pulls it off and is HUGE
wriggling fleshily in her hand Her expression becomes even more
distraught but she cannot muster forth a shout

The sound of insects-fills the air Another bug lands on her another
She looks down in growing horror and sees

Blood At her feet rising filling the field rising above the wheat
a sea of blood now dark thick

The girl tries again to scream raises her arms She is completely
covered in insects a skittering black shroud of them and when she
finally does SCREAM they flood into her mouth

CUT TO

INT LAB

Instruments show a jolt in heart rate blood pressure

Scientists note it down look over at the thing in aspic

We can tell that time has passed because it is much bigger nearly the
size of a man and in a new case

The camera moves in on the cardiograph then moves down to show a
second one Tracking a smaller much faster heartbeat

CUT TO

INT HALLLWAY

Tiny dark and we are moving through it at impossible speed turning
into another without slowing up into an air vent still moving moving
until we reach a chamber some place where all we can see is a mass of

dark moving inhuman fle it welcomes us in envelops us

ANGLE RIPLEY Lying somewhere maybe the dark-chamber -- in the dream
it keeps shifting

She opens her eyes but they are dark whiteless

She reaches for her chest and begins scratching Hard
Tearing at it as blood wells up spilling over her sides
CUT TO

INT OPERATING CHAMBER

And the cause of this dream becomes apparant

ANGLE RIPLEYS CHEST
being cut open with a lasersaw

We see her body still has a layer of the aspic-slime clinging to it
And her skin is unnaturally blue But as we PAN from her chest to her
face her identity is unmistakable

Around her are several men in operating masks Cutting her GEDIMAN a
young and enthusiastic scientist One man seemingly in charge stands
a bit off watching This by tag on his coat is DR WREN

WREN

Careful ready with the amnio

Gediman finishes cutting Another man steps in with a clamp Sets it
Pulls apart the chest

GEDIMAN

There she is

He says it like hes found a lost kitten He reaches in an pulls out a
sleeping fetal but nearly ready to burst ALIEN Others work at
severing umbilical threads that tie it to Ripleys chest

GEDIMAN

Here we go

He holds it up and others step in with the amnio a sort of incubator
filled with amniotic fluid

The alien SCREAMS its tiny mouth full with teeth and wriggles out of
his grasp

WREN

Watch it

Everybody panics -- but before the thing can get completely away from
him Gediman grabs it and sticks it in the amnio Someone shuts the
top rapidly

Everybody looks at each other for a moment

GEDIMAN

Well

WREN

The host

A surgeon looks at Ripleys readings

SURGEON
Doing fine

Gediman looks at Wren hopefully Wren nods
WREN

Sew her back up

Gediman and the surgeon get to work as the others carefully remove the
alien

GEDIMAN

Well that went as well as could be expected--

Ripleys hand LASHES OUT GRABS the surgeons forearm He yells in
pain as her fingers dig into him the others scramble knocking things
over and we HEAR HIS BONE CRACKING

SMASH CUT TO

INT RIPLEYS CELL

Sudden stillness

Ripley crouches in the middle of a small dark chamber Shes wide
eyed staring straight ahead in a state of near catatonia Hair tangled

and wild But at least shes not so blue as before

The only light on her comes from directly above from a thick pane of
glass in the center of the ceiling

ANGLE ABOVE THE CELL

A guard stands on the floor above looking into the cell through the
square of glass in the floor directly above Ripley

(We see other panes of glass lining the floor indicating more cells
below)

ANGLE RIPLEY

She is still for a long while Then she lifts her hands looking at
them

Touches her face her skin

She fingers her tunic pulls down the neck There is a scar running
along her chest

She fingers it thoughtfully -

She looks at her forearm Tattooed near the crook of her elbow is the
number 8

She looks up her face unreadable
CUT TO

INT LAB

Ripley is sitting on a table as Gediman draws blood from her
He deposits it in a test beaker studies her eyes

Wren enters looking at a chart

WREN

Hows our number Eight today

GEDIMAN

Appears to be in good health

WREN

(noticing his tone)

How good

GEDIMAN

Extraordinary As in completely off our projected charts
(shows him some photos) Look at the scar tissue See the recession
WREN

This is from --

GEDIMAN

Yesterday

WREN

This is good This is very good

GEDIMAN

Id like to run some tests strength coordination Were not
looking at a normal cloning arc

WREN

Approved

Wren goes up to Ripley studies her face with satisfaction
WREN

Well it looks like youre going to make us all very proud
She grabs his throat with dazzling speed applying deadly pressure as
she brings his face to hers Her eyes are burn but lost

RIPLEY

Why

GEDIMAN

Oh my God

He is as wide eyed as WREN and he isnt having his windpipe crushed

After a moment the shock wears off and he slams his hand into the
alarm

Klaxons red light fire up

A guard rushes in levels his weapon at Ripley After a moment of
staring him down she opens her hand Wren falls to his knees gasping

The guard FIRES his rifle at her -- a powerful electrical charge lashes
out and sends her flying back into the corner

WREN

No No Im all right

The guards keep their weapons -- burners these shockrifles are
called -- leveled at Ripley She has recovered from the shock quickly
sits crumpled in the corner looking at nothing in particular

RIPLEY (wearily)

Why

CUT TO

INT OBSERVATION ROOM

Wren and Gediman watch through a one way mirror as a scientist tests
Ripley

With them is General PEREZ the man in charge this boat Ramrod
straight and about as gruff as you would expect he stares at Ripley
suspiciously

ANGLE RIPLEY

The scientist is holding up cards with pictures on them house dog
boat

Ripley gives answers we cant hear through the glass looking pissed
off and bored

WREN
Its unprecedented

GEDIMAN

Totally Shes operating at a completely adult capacity
PEREZ

And her memories

WREN

There are gaps And theres some degree of cognitive dissonance
GEDIMAN

Shes freaked

Wren shoots Gediman a stern look at his unscientific parlance
WREN

It has some connective difficulties A kind of low level emotional
autism

Certain reactions

Perez looks at Ripley through the glass then exits into the hall
TO

INT HALL - CONTINUOUS

The two scientists follow pace him as he strides down towards a second
observation room

GEDIMAN

But the thing is we cant terminate her It

PEREZ

You havent told me what you think has caused this

Cloned genes dont contain memory cells not even when theyre brought
to adult term Im right

GEDIMAN

Theres been cases
PEREZ

Not like this

WREN
Well we dont have nearly enough data but in some cases there is a
collective memory passed down generationally At a genetic level Like
instinct only more complex structurally

PEREZ

In some cases Youre talking about the alien

WREN

Yes

PEREZ

You promised me there wasnt going to be any crossing

WREN

Its not like the other ones

Perez punches code puts his hand on the scanner and the second
observation room door opens

He steps in the other two right behind him
CUT TO
INT OBSERVATION ROOM TWO

Darker than the first one and with two of the heavily armoured guards
by the door

Apart from-that identical Perez turns to the others
PEREZ

But there is some genetic mix

WREN

Yes

PEREZ

Will there be further mutation

GEDIMAN

Mutation isnt exactly I dont think so
WREN

Thats one of the things we need to study
PEREZ

All right You can keep it But secure under obsorvation and for
Gods sake keep it away from here I dont want any more surprises
And as he speaks the ALIEN RISES RIGHT BEHIND HIM -- its big the
ridges on its head indicating a young queen -- it hisses and LUNGES at
the back of his head

The reinforced plastic window between them which we couldnt see
stops it

As it hits a thin laser grid buzzes to life sparks crackling on the
aliens face

Its bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off
Perez turns to look at it with the others

PEREZ

It took a hell of a lot to get us here

GEDIMAN

No shit

Wren shoots him another look

PEREZ

How soon before this ones ovulating

WREN

Days

PEREZ

Is that normal

WREN

No way of knowing for sure but Id say its accelerated
(After a moment) Were going to need the supplies

PEREZ

Theyre coming Soon

CUT TO

INT MESS HALL

Ripley sits across from Gediman He is eating at a good pace - Ripley
however has stopped She is staring at her fork her brows furrowed
Turns it over in her hand in her mind

GEDIMAN
Fork

The memory comes and she shakes her head wearily

RIPLEY (softly)

Fuck

GEDIMAN (pretending to correct her)

Fork

Ever so slightly she smiles The smile fades
RIPLEY

How did you

GEDIMAN

and after a moment

How did we get you Blood samples from Fiori 16 On ice

Do you remember that place
RIPLEY

Does it grow

GEDIMAN

Does it Yeah Rapidly

Its a queen

GEDIMAN

How did you know that
RIPLEY

Itll breed Youll die Everyone in the
for the word then spits it out) Company

GEDIMAN
Company
WREN (0S)

Weyland Yutani

fucking

Will die

He has entered behind her comes up to the table

WREN

(searches
Our Ripleys former employers Terran Growth conglom had some defense
contracts under the military Before your time Gediman -- they went
under decades ago bought out by Walmart Fortunes of war

(to Ripley)

Youll find things have changed a good deal since your time

RIPLEY

1 doubt that

WREN

Were not flying blind here you know This is United Systems
military not some greedy corporation The potential benefits of this

race go way beyond urban pacification

New alloys new vaccines theres nothing like this in any world
weve seen

You should be very proud
She laughs bitterly
RIPLEY

Oh I am

WREN

And the animal itself is wonderous Theyll be invaluable once weve
harnessed them

RIPLEY
Its a cancer You cant teach it tricks

This stops Wren and he retreats silently Ripley repeats word to
herself thinking

RIPLEY

Them

CUT TO

INT HALL CONTINUOUS

As Wren is leaving the mess he is accosted by an ensign
ENSIGN

Doctor General Perez is asking for you Weve been hailed

CuT TO
EXT DEEP SPACE

We see the Auriga far in the distance Suddenly A SHIP ROARS INTO FRAME
heading for it

A small vessel it is every bit dirty and jerry-rigged as the Auriga is
pristine

To accentuate the difference the sudden roar of its engines is
accompanied by

HEAVY THRASHING ROCK MUSIC

CUT TO

INT COCKPIT CONTINUOUS

The music is coming from nearby Piloting the ship toward the Auriga
is HILLARD a roughskinned woman in her forties along with RANE a
slight and quiet fellow

Behind them stands ELGYN the leader of the group

Has the kind of authority that doesnt need to flaunt itself

Maybe fifty by the silver in his hair He speaks into the vidcom
ELGYN

(good naturedly)

My authorization code is fuck you son Now open the goddamn bay or
General Perez is gonna do a Wichita stomp on your virgin ass

He switches off

RANE

Wichita stomp

ELGYN

I guarantee that boys Never seen the inside of a woman
(to Hillard)

Bring us in on three-oh descent ride the parallel
HILLARD

Darlin its done

ELGYN

Dont cut thrust till six hundred meters Give em a little fright
He puts his hand on her shoulder runs it up along her cheek as he
exits

Theyre more than friends

He moves through a hallway sticks his head in a cubicle

ELGYN

Christie St Just Rise and shine Were docking

He proceeds into

INT CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

Its the largest space in this boat two stories high Taking up most
of the space are two HARVESTERS big rusty hovering threshers roughly

the size of winnebagos

As Elgyn enters we CRANE UP to reveal ANNALEE-CALL working atop one of
them

Shes young tough -- at home with this motley bunch despite her youth
and prettiness

ELGYN

Call CALL

The music is louder here -- its blasting from a box in the corner
Elgyn switches it off

ELGYN

Call

CALL

What

ELGYN

Were docking Are the cargo trucks secured
CALL

I checked em an hour ago

ELGYN

I dont want em so much as rattled Any leakage I take it out of your
hide

CALL

Trust me boss
ELGYN (laughs)

Not my style

He leans down looks under the thresher Lying on a gurneylike steel
dolly working under the machine is VRIESS chie mechanic Late
forties in pretty good shape considering hes got no legs

ELGYN

Hows it looking

VRIESS Its never gonna be pretty but shell fly The other ones a
total fucking write-off

ELGYN

Youll make it good

VRIESS

Dont be so sure

(calls out) Call Adjust the generator plugs

ELGYN (straightening up)

They just gotta run Vriess They dont gotta run far

He exits

CUT TO INT HALL CONTINTJOUS

CHRISTIE is up and mostly dressed He is black very large and has
distinctly military bearing He speaks with quiet dont-fuck-with-me
authority

CHRISTIE

Whats our status

ELGYN

Were coming in Time to enjoy a little of the generals hospitality
ST JUST

Oh great Army food

ST JUST (San-Jhoost) is slim Asian -- and the epitome of cool
Moves quickly and silently a sly grin playing about lips He is
strapping a contraption to his forearm It resembles a deringer
holder but a very complex one

ELGYN We could use a rest till the heats off and Vriess can get
those harvesters on their feet

Thisll keep us for a couple of days

friendly
CHRISTIE

We expecting any trouble

assuming the natives are

ELGYN
From Perez I doubt it Still lets be ever vigilant
CUT TO INT CARGO BAY CONTNIUOUS

ANGLE VRIESS working intently the

thresher inches above his head
VRIESS

Im patched in

Call

ANGLE THE CONTROLS

extremely nasty blades of the

Check the sequence timer

A hand reaches in toward the ON switch

ANGLE VRIESS

VRIESS

Call

The thresher GRINDS TO LIFE -- a hundred blades and claws spinning at

Vriesss head

Vriess wheels out from under the machine in a second flat

VRIESS
Goddamnit

The second hes out he hits a lever
transforming it-into a wheelchair

VRIESS Johner You son of a whore
JOHNER jumps down from the machine
ugly with ugly scars crisscrossing

and the back of the dolly flies up

laughing Hes thickset mean and

his ugly bald head

Thought Id give you a little haircut there

VRIESS
You fuck

Call who has been over on the other side of the thresher ably climbs
up on it and switches it off

JOHNER

You should see your face Vriess you must have soiled yourself
VRIESS One of these days Im gonna kill you My hand to God
JOHNER

Well you already gave him your feet

CALL (jumping down)

Youre a limp fucking scrotum you know that

JOHNER

Either of you want a piece of me Im less than busy

VRIESS

Any time

CALL

Vriess Forget it Hes been sucking down too much homebrew
JOHNER

Dont push me little Annalee You hang with us a while youll learn
Im not the man with whom to fuck

He exits full of annoying bravado
VRIESS
That inbred cocksucker

He feels his forehead comes up with a bit of blood Realizes how
close it was

Call looks up at the thresher
CALL

1 hate machines

VRIESS

Well now we know it works

CUT TO EXT AURIGA DOCKING BAY
As it opens to admit the proportionally tiny ship The bay on the
bottom of the Auriga

- the doors are actually OVER the ship which rises into the airlock

INT AIR LOCK

The outer doors close under the ship Pressurized air shoot into the
airlock for a few seconds and then the inner door opens the ship
rising into the bay

INT BAY

The ship moves slowly along the huge dock to land gently at far end
The top of the ship is nearly level with a grated platform that runs
the length of the bay

ree soldiers in full armour stand rigid on the platform The hatch
top the ship slowly opens One by one the crew files out Seeing them
masse we get a clearer view of what separates them from this
nvironment Theyre not wearing uniforms Theyre an eclectic
iercely indivualist group their look varied -- spots of bright color
owing through militarian space gear Johners bright tuorquise
owling shirt Elgys and St Justs floorlength leather dusters Even
riesss chair stands out as he wheels down the platform

c7THUnhhowH

What they have in common is the toughness the wary eyes leathery
skin The cool readiness to kill These guys are smugglers A long
while ago youd have called them pirates

All eight of them emerge one by one looking around them They file
past the silent uniformed soldiers The last one suddenly puts a hand
on Johners jacket stops him

There is a bulge under it A green sensor light on the back of the
soldiers glove turns red when he touches the bulge

SOLDIER

No projectile weaponry is allowed on board the vessel sir

Johner opens his jacket shows what hes packing a large thermos
JOHNER

Moonshine My own Much more dangerous

SOLDIER

Sorry sir

ELGYN (to Perez)

What do you think were going to hijack the vessel All eight of us

No I think one of your asshole crew is going to get drunk and put a
bullet through the hull we are in space Elgyn
He enters from the antechamber motions for the crew to follow him
Vriess comes abreast of the soldier

VRIESS

Wanna check the chair

The soldier makes no response simply falls in behind Call the last of
them

CuT TO INT ANTECHAMBER

The long neck that connects the bay to the body of the ship The group
proceeds down it the crew looking about them at the sterile grandeur

ST JUST

This place is really clean

JOHNER (to a guard)

Hey You got any whores on this vessel
(the guard remains stonefaced)

Any loose women with bad eyesight

PEREZ

I think youll find our accomodations somewhat spartan Although the
cook sets a good-table

JOHNER That aint what Im hungry for

VRIESS (to Call)

Whats the matter

She is looking around her somewhat tensely

CALL

I dont like army

HILLARD

Yeah join the fucking club

CUT TO ANGLE MONEY

A stack of bills dropped down on a desk then another Theyre green
and identifiably money But theyre square about the size of cocktail
napkins The face on them is unfamiliar Thousand dollar bills

WIDER ANGLE INT PEREZIS CHAMBERS LATER
A good sized suite decorated in a sparse military fashion Perez is
behind his desk the money sitting between him and Elgyn

PEREZ

This wasnt easy to come by

ELGYN

Neither was our cargo Youre not pleading poverty are you
PEREZ

Were well funded I mean the bills Theres not many that still deal
in coin

ELGYN

Just the ones that dont like their every transaction recorded The
fringe element

I guess that would include you though wouldnt it
PEREZ
Drink
ELGYN

Constantly Im guessing whatever youve got going here wasnt exactly
approved by congress

Perez pours two whiskeys
PEREZ (changing the subject)
So where do you go from here
ELGYN

Out by the Handle Weve got a couple of harvesters we can unload em
on one of the collectives if Vriess and Call get ‘em working

PEREZ
Call Whered you find her
ELGYN

She is severely fuckable isnt she - And the very devil with a socket
wrench

I think Vriess somewhat pines

He takes a stack of bill smells it He likes the smell-
ELGYN

She is curious about this little transaction You can hardly blame
her Awfully cloak and dagger

Perez hands a drink to ELGYN

PEREZ

This is an army operation

ELGYN

Most army research labs dont have to operate outside regulated space
And they dont call for the kind of cargo we brought

PEREZ

Do you want something Elgyn

ELGYN

Just bed and board couple of days worth If were not imposing
PEREZ

Not at all Keep out of the restricted areas dont start any fights
and mi casa is yours too

Elgyn drinks to that

PEREZ

I trust of course that you can mind your own business
ELGYN (smiles)

Im famous for it

They drink

CUT TO INT HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA

The cargo is rolled down the corridor armed guards flank it It is
wheeled into

INT A CHAMBER

Where Wren and a few others are waiting Gediman looks a little
nervous not sure this is a good idea

The cargo is locked into place on the floor and and a guard works the
electric lock

It springs open and the guard slides off a side panel
They are stacked one on the other five of them in all cryotubes
People sleeping inside

One by one the tubes are hauled to one side of the room as the second
unit is wheeled in

By the end there are ten people sleeping side by side in their tubes in
the dark chamber

The scientists meanwhile retire to INT AN ADJOINING CHAMBER with a
long glass window looking at the chamber

The last of the guards leaves the chamber and we see the door lock
behind them

Wren starts pushing buttons

The glass tops of the cryotubes slide open We see temperature and
lifesign gauges begin to change

There is a thick whirring as a part of the ceiling above the tubes
lowers lowers and rotates slowly

Stuck to the other side of it are ten alien eggs The ceiling rotates
just enough so that they are aimed at the heads of the sleepers

For a moment nothing happens

One of the sleepers eyes flutter slightly Opens All ten eggs open
simultaneously

CUT TO INT CONFERENCE HALL

A huge room used for assemblies and events It has a chain basketball
net set up at one end crude court lines taped to the floor Ripley
stands beneath the net with a ball dribbling absently

At the other end are set up tables and folding chairs The crew of the
Betty sans Elgyn are filing in to eat here Johner spies Ripley
smiles

JOHNER

Ooh

Johner comes up to Ripley Her expression makes it clear how much she
enjoys having him in her face

JOHNER

How about a little one on one
She keeps dribbling says nothing
JOHNER

What do you say
RIPLEY

Get away from me

JOHNER

Why should I

RIPLEY

Because pain hurts

He falters a moment at her quiet threat then

JOHNER Are you gonna hurt me then 1 think I might enjoy that
He smiles his ugly smile She smiles back

She hits him solidly in the chest -- and he flies back ten feet
landing badly on a group of chairs

His mates fly into action Christie grabs a standing ashtray Hillard
jumps Ripley from behind She throws her off with e -- chucks the
basketball at her hard enough to pop the air out of it

Christie swings at her and SMASHES her right in the face

She arcs back and right back up at Christies throat before he has
a chance to react squeezing batting away the ashtray just a trickle

of blood coming down her nose --

Johner cames at her again and she leaps on him throws him to the
ground snarling

SHES GONNA RIP HIS THROAT OUT WITH HER TEETH
WREN
Ripley

Ripley looks up and four guards are pointing burners at her Wren and
Gediman behind them

Call standing to one side with Vriess reacts visibly to the name
Everybody is slowly backing off St Just stands with his hands behind
his back as if concealing something

Call watches in rapt silence
WREN

Dont lets have a scene

Ripley lets go of Johner stands

RIPLEY
He smells

WREN

I imagine he does
JOHNER (barely breathing)
What the fuck are you

She looks down on him - in both senses of the phrase - Look around at
everyone staring at her

She wipes the bit of blood from under her nose flicks it away Exits
WREN (to Gediman amused)

Social skills less than a hundred percent

ANGLE RIPLEYS BLOOD

The few drops she flicked away sizzle on the floor -- not eating
through but melting a small patch

TO INT LABS - LATER

A large metal box is being wheeled next to an observation pen Soldiers
surround it weapons at the ready Not one of them at ease

Wren and Gediman watch intently
WREN

Whats the status on the Queen
GEDIMAN

We still havent detected the origin of the reproductive anomalies But
the egg laying stage appears to be over

WREN

Did we do something wrong

GEDIMAN

I dont know I think we covered everything But these redundancies

A soldier lifts a panel in the pen and then doors to the cage come open
automatically

Everyone waits

A fullgrown alien suddenly bolts into the pen The soldier shut it as
quickly as humanly possible
WREN
Father check security status observation pen six

Father the voice of the ship replies after a moment in a dulcet
comforting tone

FATHER

Pen six secure security systems functional at 100

WREN

Good Now the others

cut TO INT SLEEP CHAMBERS - NIGHT

We see VARIOUS ANGLES of people at night

Rane in a chamber on the Auriga

Hillard and Elgyn in a slightly more lush one

Perez in his quarters

VRIESS rolling about the Aurigals engine room looking it over
Christie St Just Call and Johner all playing poker in the mess hall
CUT TO INT OBSERVATION ROOM - RIGHT

A sleep cycle is indicated here by the low lighting and the near
emptiness of the room

Gediman alone is in here writing observations down in a notebook as he
watches the pen

Inside are three aliens Two of them seem to be hibernating curled up
in the corner but the third faces the glass tilting its head and
hissing at it

Gediman sits right up close to it his face just inches away from the
beasts It draws back its lips opens its mouth The metallic tongue
issues slowly forth dripping with slime

GEDIMAN (softly fascinated)

Is that a distended externus lingua or are you just happy to see
me

The creature hisses retracts the tongue Gediman scribbles few notes

Something moves in the dark behind him Before he can notice a hand
closes on his shoulder

Its Ripley She steps forward eyes locked on the cage Gediman seems
only mildly surprised
GEDIMAN

How did you get in here

RIPLEY

Beautiful arent they

GEDIMAN

Yes Yes they are Ive been monitoring their interaction

He points at a audiograph by the wall blips and waves interrupting the
vibrating line indicating sound

He notices that her hand is still on her shoulder

GEDIMAN

They communicate Through ultrasonic soundwaves Sort of like bats
RIPLEY

I know

She looks at him

RIPLEY

I can hear them

GEDIMAN (smiling)

Amazing

She runs her hand through the back of his hair gently urging him up
off his chair

GEDIMAN

Ripley

RIPLEY

Shhhhh

She pulls him close kisses him Lightly at first then deeply -
holding his head with both hands He responds with surprising warmth
the kiss drawing out pulling slowly apart

She looks at him smiles

An alien tongue SHOOTS out of her mouth burying itself in his face

SMASH CUT TO INT RIPLEYS CHAMBER
As she suddenly awakes eyes wide breathing hard

She has been sleeping we see in the same position she was before
squatting in the middle of the room She looks about her recovering
from the nightmare Her breathing slows With a somewhat fatalistic
look she settles back to sleep

CUT TO INTERIOR MESS HALL - NIGHT

Christie Call St Just and Johner are still at their all night poker
game stacks of bills peanuts and liquor scattered the table

They are in a tense hand the pot impressively high
JOHNER

Im in

CHRISTIE

All right

ST JUST

Raise you two hundred

JOHNER

Oh fuck you

CALL

Thats it Im out Im fucked

She throws down her cards takes a swig of Johners patented moonshine
It tastes horrible

CHRISTIE

That takes me down too Johner
JOHNER

Uh Uh fuck it I fold

(to St Just)

What do-you got

St Just calmly shuffles his cards back into the deck
ST JUST

Youll always wonder

JOHNER
You asshole

CHRISTIE

CALL

Deal me out Its not my night

She tries to stand up takes a spill over her chair The others laugh
CALL

Jesus Johner what do you put in that shit battery acid
JOHNER

Just for coloring

ST JUST (producing a small vial

I got something thatll take the edge off that

CALL Thanks Ill walk it off

She stumbles out of the room Johner shuffles the deck

JOHNER

Bitches should not play with the boys they will get cleaned out
(dealing)

Eight card throwback fuck your sister and the sevens are wild
cut TO INT HALL

As soon as she is out of sight Call straightens up completely sober
She looks around her and takes off toward the restricted areas

She comes to the door and making sure no one is around star punching
in code on the keypad

CUT TO INT CELLBLOCK - MOMENTS LATER
As Call pads silently down it looking for one cell
TO INT RIPLEYS CELL - CONTINUOUS

The cell door opens silently Call hesitates a moment then slips in
shutting the door behind her

Ripley is sleeping still in the squatting position in the middle of
the room

Call approaches
She stares down at Ripley a moment A shadow passes as a guard walks
above them

Call tenses till he is gone Looks back down at Ripley -- still
sleeping

Call extends her hand flexes her wrist The meanest lookin stilletto
youve ever seen extends from out her sleeve it gotta be a foot long
and sharp enough to shave with

She lifts back her arm the better to punch it through Ripleys heart
Ripley shifts slightly Call stops

ANGLE RIPLEYS CHEST

Her shirt is open enough to show a good portion of the scar Call
hesitates staring realization flooding her face

RIPLEY

Well

Call starts moving back a pace
RIPLEY

You gonna kill me or what

CALL

Theres no point is there

A flick of her wrist and the stilletto whips back up her sleeve
Ripley sits up

CALL

Its already out of you Christ Is it here Is it on board

RIPLEY (smiling)

You mean my baby CALL

I dont understand If theyve got it why are they keeping you alive
RIPLEY

Curious Im the latest thing

CALL

She raises her arm the stilletto gliding out again
CALL

I can make it stop The pain this nightmare Thats all I can
offer you

Ripley holds her palm up presses it against the point of the blade
RIPLEY

What makes you think I would let you do that

Ripley pushes her hand out - the blade goes RIGHT THROUGH HER PALM She
keeps pushing her hand out slowly a good five inches of the blade
sticking out the back of her hand before she stops Call stares at
her

CALL

What are you

RIPLEY

Ripley Ellen Lieutenant first class number 36706

CALL

Ellen Ripley died two hundred years ago

Ripley pulls her hand back suddenly grimacing at the pain

RIPLEY

What do you know about it

CALL

Ive read Morse -- Ive read all the banned histories She gave her
life to protect us from the beast Youre not her

RIPLEY

If Im not her What am I

CALL

Youre a thing A construct They grew you in a fucking lab
RIPLEY

But only God can make a tree

CALL

And now theyve brought the beast out of you

RIPLEY (smiling)
Not all the way out

CALL

What

RIPLEY

Its in my head Behind my eyes I can hear it moving The beast

The smile is gone some real vulnerability showing through Call
softens trying a different tack

CALL

Help me If theres anything human in you at all help me stop them
before this thing gets loose

RIPLEY
Its already loose

Calls expression changes Those words terrify her but shes not sure
if Ripley means what she thinks

Ripley raises her hand at Calls head -- Call flinches but Ripley stops
a few inches away

Then touches her forehead gently almost sensually

RIPLEY

Once the thought the hope for it grows here it has found
its way

It will come because man will bring it Bring it forth

CALL

You want that

RIPLEY

Ive come to terms with the fact of it Its inevitable

CALL

Not so long as theres breath-in me

Ripley LASHES OUT and GRABS CALLS THROAT Call swings wit the blade
but Ripley has her arm pinned before she can connect Ripley squeezes
the girls neck

Ripley looks at the girl with a world of sadness

RIPLEY
I can make it stop

Calls eyes are pleading terrified Ripley finally lets go and she
drops to the ground gasping for air RIPLEY

Go Theyre coming for you

As soon as she can move Call scrambles up and heads out

CUT TO INT HALL - CONTINUOUS

Call comes out and before she can move a RIFLE BUT hits her the head
She goes down but not out as two guards grab her Wren is with them
and three more

WREN

I think youre gonna find that this was ill advised

(to the men) Where are her friends

GUARD

Mess hall most of them

WREN

Sound the alarm I want them rounded up Now

TO INT MESS HALL - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE THE CARD TABLE

Being kicked over

Elgyn Hillard and Rane are pushed into the room sleepy and confused
Christie St Just and Johner are all being herded in by soldiers
Call is thrown into the group as well

ELGYN

What the fuck is going on here

CHRISTIE

Looks like a doublecross boss

WREN

Wheres the other one With the chair

JOHNER (to a soldier)

Get your fucking hands off me
ELGYN

Do you mind telling me what the fuck youre up to
WREN

Shut up

(to a guard) Get the general Wake him up

ELGYN

Look if theres a problem tell me what it is We can work this out
there is no need to get emotional

St Just is silent standing in the same position he was when Ripley
attacked Johner

Hands behind his back

ANGLE BEHIND ST JUSTS BACK

As Elgyn speaks two gunsslip out of his sleeves and fill his hands
CALL

They got nothing to do with this Wren

ELGYN (to Call)

To do with what

WREN I dont give a fuck Its way too late for that Youre all
looking at a firing squad

You hear me
ELGYN
I do St Just

With lighting precision St Just raises his hands and blows of the
guards away

He takes out a third to his left without even looking that way

One guard gets off a shot with his burner frying Rane before Hillards
elbow knocks his teeth well into his throat

Christie tackles the next as Johner presses a latch on the bottom of
his thermos -- the top half flies off revealing handle of a gun
inside He grabs it and another guard runs Johner doesnt have time
to pull the gun-out of the the so he SHOOTS right through it sending
the guard flying

CuT TO INT ALIEN OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS
Alarms flashing red lights Gediman looking in a video monitor
GEDIMAN
What the fuck You three Go Sector two

All but one of the guards rush out to investigate Gediman works the
surveilliance screen trying to see whats happening

CUT TO INT MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS

When the smoke clears There are two guards still standing They point
their weapons inneffectually St Just a has gun to wrens head and a
gun on the guards who are also covered by Johner

ELGYN

Nice and easy boys

Call starts to take off

CALL

Im gonna finish this

Elgyn grabs her by the hair roughly pulls her back

ELGYN

Youre going nowhere Annalee

CUT TO INT OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE IN THE PEN

The three aliens have picked up the energy are stalking back and forth
like tigers in the dim light of their pen

ANGLE THEIR POV

We see Gediman and the guard their backs to us The aliens-stop
pacing One of them to the right looks at the one on the left
Something passes between them They look back at the humans At each
other

They SET ON the middle alien TEARING IT APART It lets out piercing
insectile SHRIEKS as they tear it limb from limb

Gediman spins in terror the guard bringing up his weapon Gediman hits
the lights inside the pen and as they blink to shocking brightness we

see

The remains of the third alien on the ground as a giant pool its blood
EATS A HOLE IN THE FLOOR

GEDIMAN
Oh God

He bolts for the failsafe but its too late as the blood eats all the
way through - the two aliens DIVE through the hole just as Gediman
hits the button -- freezing gas fills the chamber but theres nothing
to freeze

GEDIMAN

No no no

He hits another sequence and the door slides open He rushes in
kneels by the hole and looks down

ANGLE HIS POV

Their blood has already eaten through two levels
GEDIMAN

Christ They could be anywhere

He looks up at the guard -- and an alien FLIES UP at him through the
hole

It was hanging on the ceiling below and it pulls him through before he
can breathe a decent scream

The guard just stares shaking

CUT TO INT MESS HALL

The mexican standoff is getting even more heated

CHRISTIE

Who gives a shit We have to get out of here

ELGYN

If Calls got something going here I want to know what it is
WREN

You brought her here

Two more guards rush in Johner shoves his gun in Wrens mouth
JOHNER

Drop them Im not fucking with you

CHRISTIE (indicating the dead soldiers)

Boss we got bodies here It doesnt matter what Calls up to were
all fucked now
CALL

I have to stop him If I dont well all die

WREN (pulls his mouth away)

Elgyn tell me what you know If shes alone in this
HILLARD

In what

Johner puts his gun to Calls temple now

JOHNER

Does anyone want me to make this simple

Far away a SCREAM Everyone stops Wren turns slowly in the direction
it came from

WREN

No

cut TO INT HALLWAY BY LABS

A technican RUNS screaming just as an alien LEAPS on him from behind
The CAMERA RUSHES AWAY frenzied as the scene to pick up a guard in
the next hall firing wildly at the ceiling as an alien dissappears up
an airvent There are three bodies lying dead before us

ANGLE IN THE PENS

We see that the aliens have been freed Smoke dead bodies the
plexiglass partition to one 1 cage is cracked and open

CuT TO INT RIPLEYS CELL - CONTINUOUS

Ripley sits in the dark the noise of Chaos just beginning filter in
And she just cant help herself

She is LAUGHING

He is mostly dressed still shaking off sleep He stands at the
command console bringing up visual Everything on the screens is
smoke and noise

PEREZ

stiffens at the sight of it
He punches up a different sector The labs and here is a badly wounded
lieutenant

PEREZ

LIEUTENANT

Containment is impossible sir I think they swept the barracks
PEREZ (to himself)

A military strike Christ Jesus

After a beat he starts punching in the emergency override codes

CuT TO INT BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

Its worst here -- the aliens have taken out a dozen men in their
sleep and everyone awake is screaming One soldier runs for the
weapons cabinet -- an alien hits him from behind and SMASHES him into

it falling in a tumble of guns

Over the chaos the emergency lighting comes on floor light like an
airplanes indicating the nearest exit Fathers voice is
excruciatingly calm

FATHER

Emergency Initiate evacuation procedures immediately All hands This
is not a drill

One soldier gets a bead on an alien with his burner - fries italong
with two of his friends

Theyre out of commission but the alien is hurt only momentarily It
bounds forward takes out his face

FATHER

Emergency Initiate evacuation procedures
CUT TO

INT HALLWAY BY ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The noise is too far above to be heard down here but Fathers droning
voice and the emergency lighting are on

Vriess wheels slowly into the hall concerned He spins slowly
checking out his surroundings

ANGLE DOWN THE HALL

There is nothing Just the floor lights pulsing in succession towards
the exit

Vriess follows their lead wheeling out

CuT TO INT NEXT HALL - CONTINUOUS

Nothing here either But Vriesss fur is up -- he moves slowly
carefully

And was that a noise He looks around up at the ceiling

A drop of alien blood is eating through right above him It drips down
-- and he rolls out of the way just in time back up as the blood plops
to the floor eating casually through

cut TO INT LIFEBOAT BAY ONE - CONTINUOUS

Men are rushing into one of the lifeboats They sit facing each other
in the tiny vessel and strap themselves in Pere is here hurrying
the soldiers in pushing back the few who try to crowd in after

PEREZ

Bay three Go

The late soldiers make for the next boat as Perez seals the hatch He
hits the eject button and steps back

CUT TO EXT THE AURIGA - CONTINUOUS

As the lifeboat FIRES out of the side of the giant craft

CUT TO INT BAY THREE - CONTINUOUS

Men crowd into this one too -- its nearly full and an alien suddenly
LEAPS into it starts feeding on the men strapped down - they are
screaming

Perez runs in as a soldier outside the lifeboat fires his burner
hitting the alien the men the controls -- a shower of sparks as the
alien-turns about to spring on the soldier as he rolls in a grenade
The doors shut and and a soldier hits the eject button

TO EXT AURIGA - CONTINUOUS

The second lifeboat comes shooting out and moments later EXPLODES

CuT TO INT MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS

The noise of the explosion - and of a few inside as well - is all
around the group

Fathers voice still urges evacuaticion
WREN

NO
(to Call)

What have you done

CALL

Nothing Not a goddanm thing You thought you could control it
ELGYN

All right We make for the Betty Can he walk

He is pointing at Rane who nods standing

HILLARD Bettys all the way across the ship Who knows whats in
between

CALL (indicating Wren)

He does

One of the soldiers steps forward DiStephano
DISTEPHANO (to Wren)

Sir we have to go

(to Elgyn) Let him go No quarrel

ELGYN

You can have him when were off Not before

They start out dragging Wren along Guns still on Call and the
soldiers

What about Vriess

JOHNER

Fuck Vriess

cuT TO INT FALL - CONTINUOUS

Vries enters looking around He is getting seriously wigged

The lights on the floor still pulse Urging him forward He obeys
Something stirs in the rafters Coiled about the pipes

Vriess stops still a good thirty feet from the beast Strains to see
It starts MOVING climbing at him upside down on the pipes FAST

Vriess starts wheeling himself back away but SLOWLY agonizingly slowly
compared to the beast
He turns the corner spins around

The hall is fifty feet long At the far end a few soldiers running
through

SERGEANT

Seal off that sector

A soldier runs to obey working the door controls
VRIESS

No

The soldier sees him but the fear on the boys face telegraphs his-—
decision

Vreiess starts pumping toward the door Hes strong picking up speed
but the alien rounds the corner and bolts after him

Vriess cant even look back as the thing gains on him The door begins
to come down the soldier finishing the sequence and running off

Vriess rolls face set -- the alien a few feet behind reaching for him

An EXPLOSION far away ROCKS THE SHIP -- the hall tilted momentarily
Vriess gets a boost as he rockets downhill the beast still on him
the door closing too low for him to clear He gets there and SLAMS a
lever his chair FLATTENS out to a dolly position his head just
CLEARS the closing door as the alien SLAMS into it Vriess spinning out
and flying off the chair it tilts landing in a heap next to him

Lying still on the ground he listens as the beast slams against the
door a few more times then fades off

VRIESS
Fuck everything

He reaches up for the chair and from the back of it he pulls out a
shotgun

CUT TO INT LIFEBOAT BAY 5 - CONTINUOUS

Perez is trying to maintain order He is failing Grabs a corporal
PEREZ

Muster a squad to search for survivors

CORPORAL

Fuck no Fuck no Fuck you

Perez slams him to the ground with his fist
An ALIEN LEAPS OUT at him from the ceiling The soldiers scatter Perez
just leaping out of the way --

PEREZ
Shoot it Fry it
A couple of men fire their burners to little effect

One soldier runs up to the action His head is bloodied his expression
vengefully grim

The soldier whips out a pistol privateissue he takes a bead on the
thing --

PEREZ
NO

And the soldier FIRES -- pumps three bullets into the beast sends it
flying back toward the window

Perez is riveted by the sight of ANGLE DROPS OF BLOOD

big ones hitting the window Everything seems to move slowly now - the
alien struggling as the soldier pumps two more bullets into it the
other soldiers Perez -- the monster falls and the BLOOD EATS THROUGH
THE WINDOW

PEREZ

Get out Everyone Now

Soldiers are beginning to get it The window CRACKS begins to SHAKE
as the blood is almost through it

Even the soldier who shot the alien has stopped his face frozen in
horror at what hes about to accomplish

Perez shoves him herds the rest out looking back --

PEREZ

Clear the sector

at the window the blood is almost through --

Men are pouring out of the hall -- some move down a side hall and SLAM
the door shut behind them but most are making for the main exit
anyway

FATHER

Warning Potential hullbreach Clear sector

The blood eats a hole in the window -- the nearest soldier is sucked
back against the window -- he SCREAMS as he is sucked through a hole
no bigger than his fist

Still men are falling over each other Perez herding them out

A huge CRACKING sound and Perez shuts his eyes

The window explodes outward the air blowing everything int space
Debris vehicles men all tangled and dead as they blown out into the
black

ANGLE THE SECTOR DOORS

SLAM shut instantly one cutting right through a soldier halfway out
ANGLE AIR VENTS

Gates slam down here as well

ANGLE ELECTRICAL DUCTS

Foam SHOOTS into them hardening instantly sealing the breached
sector

FATHER
Breach contained Sector five nonfunctional
CUT TO INT HALL - CONTINUOUS

As the crew moves quickly through They come to a shut door red
lights along it indicating its locked

ELGYN (to DiStephano)

Open it

DISTEPHMO

I cant

Johner puts his gun to the soldiers head

WREN

He cant The sectors closed The hulls been breached
ELGYN

Okay which way

WREN

Well have to go through the holding cells Here
ELGYN

All right
They turn left entering
INT CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

that leads to the holding cells The room is big a railing at one end
looking over another chamber two flights down

A shut door separates the chamber from the cells

ELGYN

Can you get that one open

It comes from the rafters dropping down on Elgyn in a heartbeat He
barely has time to scream before it shoots its tongue through the back

of his skull

Hillard has time She SCREAMS as her lovers brains come out his
mouth

The beast leaps at the group scattering them like bowling pins as it
claws into one of the guards Everybody else is scrambling for cover

St Just tries to escape by running past the beast - its tail lashes
out tangling his feet and tripping him up his head smashing against a

pipe

Another guard hits it with the burner -- it shrieks and lands on him
Johner shoots at it but is far too panicked to hit it

Call has backed to the far wall -- she desperately works the controls
to open the door

It starts to rise

CALL

Christie Hillard Come on

The door rises fully Ripley stands behind it
Call starts back not sure what the woman will do
Ripley surveys the scene

The Alien burrowing its head into the belly of the guard stops
Looks up

Everyone watches as the two creatures sense each other ThE alien
hisses rears back

Ripley looks away contemplative We see a gamut of emotions cross her
face but her posture passive sacrificial She does not move

Everyone watches too afraid to breathe
The alien LUNGES at her leaping across the room in two bounds Its on
her -- and she SPINS GPABBING IT and HURLS IT AWAY

It lands in a tangle but is up again in a microsecond jumps at her
knocks her back into the room on her its claws digging into her skin

piston tongue at her face inches away

She locks an arm around its slick long head and pulls back we hear its
tendons strain snap

CALL (to a guard)
Shoot it Shoot them both

She grabs his gun and BURNS them both Two less-than-human SCREAMS
fill the room as they briefly disentangle thrown apart

The beast recovers first dodging the next blast and going for Ripley
again

Ripley on her back reaches behind her grabs a table leg and with
inhuman strength brings the table down on the monsters head

She dives at it as it comes out from under
Call shoots as Ripley hits the alien theyre both fried as Ripleys

momentum sends them over a railing and they FALL TWENTY FEET -- the
Alien lands with a spine snapping crunch

Ripley only slightly better

A few crew members rush to look over the railing Christie starts down
the spiral staircase to that level

JOHNER

Where are you going

The creature rolls back onto Ripley grabbing her with its dying
strength Her face is rigid with pain and anger as she holds it off
its jaws open dripping shaking

The tongue SHOOTS OUT and Ripley GRABS IT HOLDS IT

A scream wells up in her throat A totally animal killshriek that she
SCREAMS victorious as she RIPS THE ALIENS TONGUE OUT OF ITS FACE

She stands bellows another warrior cry The crew has gathered near
They watch her awed wary Ripley walks slowly up to them -- up to
Call Ripley looks a tad pissed

Call tenses maybe wishing she hadnt shot Ripley as well
Ripley takes Calls hand puts the tongue in it walks on

Call looks at the dripping souvenier The pincers at the end still
twitching
CHRISTIE

What the FUCK is going on here

RANE

What was that thing Are there more of that thing

JOHNER (to Call)

Make a hell of a necklace

ANGLE HILLARD

on the upper level kneeling by Elgyns body No tears but terribly
quiet

What do we do

CHRISTIE

RANE

RIPLEY

So who do I have to fuck to get off this boat

CHRISTIE

You bought your ticket when you killed that thing welcome aboard
CALL

Are you fucking crazy She doesnt care if we

CHRISTIE (fiercely)

You got no authority here Call- Now secure it

Its the first time Christie has raised his voice and it has the
desired effect

After a silent moment Call starts again softly
CALL

Christie shes not human Wren cloned her because she was carrying an
alien in her

She could turn --

JOHNER

Nobody cares about your opinion you bitch you fucking mole --
CALL

Shell turn on us Just like that

CHRISTIE

I dont give a syphallitic fuck whether you people can get along or
not If weve got a wish to live then we work together and that
includes bug-lady

CALL

You cant trust her

CHRISTIE

I dont trust anyone CUT TO INT CHAMBERCELLBLOCK - A BIT LATER
The group is still in the adjoining chamber but looking here into the
cellblock where

Ripley had been DiStephano and St Just come first guns ready
looking about them

They are followed by Christie and Wren
WREN

Theres a console in the guards station We can punch up a diagnostic
of the ship and plan a route To your ship

CHRISTIE

That likes me fine

He signals for the others to follow everyone moving cautiously
ANGLE HILLARD

Gently lays her coat over Elgyns face Johner looks down a moment
JOHNER

Via con Dios man

Hillard stands Call puts ahand on her shoulder but Hillard moves away
a distrustful look on her face

Ripley bringing up the rear watches the whole group with a sort of
fascinated detatchment

Call looks back at her Ripley smiles coldly

ANGLE IN THE CELLBLOCK

The group makes their way slowly quietly They approach a bank of
elevators but Wren points down an adjoining doorway They are about

to go there when the elevator door lights up indicating arrival

The group backs up spreads out Those who can find cover take it guns
drawn

The elevator doors open It is too dark inside to see

Suddenly sparks fly from the broken overhead in the elevator anda
figure appears in the light

Everyone jolts about to fire before they realize it is

VRIESS

Who sits in his chair a shotgun in each hand eyes wide twitchier
than they
JOHNER

Oh fuck

CALL

VRIESS (mock casual)

VRIESS

your oxidation systems

JOHNER

Docs got a bug up his ass cause Calls a mole and he thinks were a
conspiracy

VRIESS (looking at Call)

Shes a what

JOHNER

A mole A fucking spy

Vriess looks hit harder by that information than anyone
CHRISTIE

We gota mission here people Lets keep moving

They do

CUT TO INT GUARDS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE THE CONSOLE

A hologram of the ship appears above the screen It looks a solid as

the ship itself except that parts of it occasional break themselves
down to show interiors
The group looks it over Parts of the ship are simply not there the
sections around those holes red Wren points them out

WREN

Weve had hull breach by the lifeboats here on level five and down --
Jesus right by the engine room Were very lucky

ST JUST (sarcastically)

Lucky we

CHRISTIE

What about the Betty Our ship

WREN

The dock seems to be intact

CHRISTIE

Then we head for it

JOHNER

Can we track those fucking things
WREN

No

JOHNER

We could get to the Betty and they could be all over it
RANE

Are you toting a better fucking idea
WREN

All of the activity seemsto have been in the aft-sector by the
barracks

Theres no reason to suppose theyd move
RIPLEY

They wont

Everybody looks at her

RIPLEY

Theyre breeding Theyve got new bodies to work on Theyll stay
close If they send anybody out itll be here Where the meat is
CALL

The meat Jesus

ST JUST

Theyre breeding How long does that take

RIPLEY

Hours

WREN

Or less The process has accelerated something to do with the cloned
cells

CHRISTIE

Faster we get from here to there the better

ST JUST

With all the devils of hell in between

JOHNER

Well if we want to make decent time I say we ditch the cripple
(to Vriess)

No offense

VRIESS (giving him the finger)

None taken

HILLARD

Nobodys left behind Johner Not even you

Her voice is quiet mourning still thick in it Nobody backtalks her
CHRISTIE

So whats our route

WREN

Im trying to figure it we can cut through the labs but were blocked
on both sides here

Im not sure

DISTEPHMO
Sir There is the lift
WREN
Show me

DiStephano works the console and the hologram splits the route hes
indicating revealed

DISTEPHMO

The lifts They run straight from the top of the ship down to
engineering No stops but if we can get in the shaft theres a
maintenece access tunnel here

(points to the center of the shaft)

that runs above level one deck Take us right to the dock
CHRISTIE

Sounds reasonable

DISTEPHANO

I dont have the code for the access tunnel door

WREN

I can override

DISTEPHMO

(indicating the route)

Then we head through the labs then down to the kitchen To the bottom
of the shaft

Up through the tunnel and onto the ship Home free
ANGLE VRIESS

Is unloading additional ammo from inside his chair He toss one of his
shotguns to Hillard

VRIESS
They never check the chair

He pulls out a grenade launcher Its so compact its almost cute
cradled one handed like an uzi

VRIESS

Call
She looks around and he tosses it to her The gesture is not
acconmpanied by any show of warmth

VRIESS

Try not to shoot your foot off

WREN

You people should know --

ST JUST

WREN

No The aliens they bleed molecular acid
CHRISTIE

Thats right I saw that

VRIESS

So did I

JOHNER

We cant shoot them Fuck that Im shooting them
WREN

This is a big vessel and for the most part we should be okay But if
we get anywhere near the outer hull and start strafing them

He indicates the hologram the sections of the ship missing Everyone

CHISTIE

RIPLEY

CALL Shes right

She moves to the head of the line and they start

CuT TO INT LABS - LATER

As they progress Everyone with a gun has it at the ready

a few yards in front

She stops sniffs Listens

RIPLEY

Johner moves up next to her

JOHNER

Youve come up against these things before
RIPLEY

Yes

JOHNER

So what did you do

RIPLEY

I died

He lags behind a bit thrown

JOHNER

That wasnt really what I wanted to hear

DiStephano points to a door

DISTEPFANO

This way

And Ripley leads them in

CUT TO INT LAB - CONTINUOUS

As Ripley enters we can see that this lab has been trashed Ripley
surveys the wreckage calmly keeps moving As the others file in their
horrified expressions lend contrast to her lack of one

Among the debris are three bodies chests exploded outward

JOHNER

Fuck me

CHRISTIE

Lets keep moving

The door to the next chamber is ajar Christie and Vriess in then St
Just then Ripley

INT NEXT CHAMBER

Something LEAPS at Ripley from out of the shadows -- a metal bar SLAMS
into her side throwing her off balance

St Just and Christie spin weapons up and almost shoot the figure
cowering in the corner

Everyone else rushes in as he swings the bar before him eyes wild with
terror

PURVIS
Get away from me

CHRISTIE
Drop the rod man Do it
PURVIS
Get away

But the energy is out of him The rod falls with a hollow clatter He
looks weakly from face to face

PURVIS

St Just looks at his name stitched in his coveralls
ST JUST

CALL (to Wren torn)

ST JUST

WREN

I couldnt do it here The labs torn apart

ST JUST (quietly)

I could do him Painless back of the head Might be the best way
CALL

Theres gotta be another way If we freeze him --

PURVIS

They all look at him a bit sheepishly

WREN

A parasite A foreign element that

Ripley steps in front of the doctor

RIPLEY

Theres a monster in your stomach They (indicating the smugglers)
hijacked your cryotube and sold you to him (indicatingWren) and he put
an alien in you In a few hours it will punch its way through your

chest and youll die Any questions

Purvis is wide-eyed stunned After a moment he stammers
PURVIS

Who are you

RIPLEY

She starts heading out of the chamber Call turns to the others
CALL

He comes with us We can freeze him on the Betty and get the doctor to
remove it later

WREN

CHRISTIE (to Purvis herding him along)

Come with us You might even live Get twitchy on me and you will be
shot

They move out

CUT-TO INT HALL - LATER

still in the same general area still looking around every corner
Its been too quiet too long and the group senses that and They move
into

INT OBSERVATION ROOM TWO - CONTINUOUS

Its in bad shape so we might not recognize it as the chamber the
queen was in

WREN
Shes gone
ST JUST

WREN

The Queen
JOHNER
Good

He is loooking into the roomthe queen was kept in A residue of slime
is all thats left here

Beyond the queens chamber is another observation room Wren indicates
that they have to go through

Suddenly a burner blast FIRES at them just missing them as they duck
They hear more blasts not aimed at them and screams

SOLDIER (0S)

Pull back Pull back

OTHER SOLDIER (0S)

Its on me

Ripley looks up and can just see two aliens making short work of a
group of soldiers

Call instantly moves to attack and Ripley grabs her holds tight
CALL

Weve got to help them

RIPLEY

Cant

CALL

You bitch let go of me

She does and Call rises

The noise is gone What she can see of the soldiers-is parts

She is shaking at the vision when an alien RISES in front on the
soldiers Call ducks back down terrified

Christie hisses at her
CHRISTIE
You want to get yourself killed then you run solo

ST JUST

CHRISTIE

Wren goes over to the failsafe button The others look out at the
aliens

CHRISTIE

Ripley grabs her Looks at the others
RIPLEY

Come on Do you want to live or not

(to Call) It wont hurt long

CALL (terrified)

Noo

of protest

RIPLEY (to Wren)

Now

Wren hits the button just as three aliens are bounding across the cage
-- theyre almost to the posse people screaming scrambling when the

freezing gas hits turning the beasts to statues

The forth one sees this and flees but St Just stands and put four
bullets in it from forty yards It slumps over

Everyone is silent stunned Breathing hard

VRIESS (realizes)

Fear

Ripley nods

VRIESS

Thats how they knew it was a trap They couldnt smell the fear
RIPLEY (looking at Call)

So I gave them some

JOHNER (gleefully)

Son of a bitch

He pops up and FIRES at the frozen aliens - - they EXPLODE into
fragments

CUT TO EXT AURIGA
Gildihg through space passing Jupiters moons with dazzling speed
cut TO INT HALL LATER

Ripley and Call are on point Ripley looks down the hall Call is
staring at her and

Ripley can feel the girls eyes on her back
RIPLEY (without looking around)

Did you think I was going to feed you to them
CALL

I think you still might

Ripley smiles She may be right

RIPLEY
I want to live

CALL

And you dont care about anything else

RIPLEY

No

CALL (bitterly)

I guess youre more human than I thought

RIPLEY

Why did you come here

CALL

To kill you remember (after a beat) Because somebody has to
RIPLEY

well its not me I did my time Now I just want to
She stops dead staring at a door

CLONING STORAGE FACILITY is written on it Stencilled beneath that is
“numbers 1-7°

Ripley stares Tries the door which opens

DISTEPHMO

Thats not the way

CHRISTIE

Ripley we got no time for sightseeing

Ripley is looking down at her arm at the 8 tattooed on it
She looks at Call Looks back at wren

WREN

Ripley dont

She enters

cut TO INT CLONING STORAGE FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

She stands a moment staring before proceeding through it Call

stands in the doorway others crowding behind her Every face registers
the horror of what they are seeing but none more so than Ripleys
Numbers one through seven The first failed efforts to clone Ripley
They are lined up like museum exhibits -- or side show freaks

Here is the fetal Ripley the fetal alien visible through its
translucent chest

In a jar

Here is a prematurely old diseased Ripley withered blue skin cling to
Collapsed bones

Here is an attempt to separate the alien and grow it without the host -
- boneless bubbling tissue weak and useless mouth rigored in midmew

Each one more horrifying than the last and the last the worst of all
Ripley approaches and stares at number seven

A complete mixture of alien and human DNA

A tortured disgusting hybrid half Ripley half nightmare

Hooked up wires and machines it lies on the tilted-table its head
nearly level with

Ripleys as she finally approaches it
When it opens its eyes they are hers
it tuns its head ever so slightly to look at her Recognises her

Ripley cannot even speak She begins to shake slightly looking at
number seven

NUMBER SEVEN
Kill us

Ripleys eyes go saucered as it speaks speaks out of nothing resembling
a mouth

Ripley staggers back a step shaking now This is too much to bear
CALL
Ripley

Ripley turns slowly still in a fever dream

Call cocks the grenade launcher with a loud CRACK Her eyes meet
Ripleys

Call tosses it to Ripley as the crew steps back and even a catches it
Ripley FIRES a grenade chugging to the end of room and BURSTING in
fire and noise she FIRES another tissue and steel exploding into

flame she turns to number seven hand shakes momentarilyAnd she
FIRES the poor creature dissolving in a cloud of flame

Freezing gas jets fill the room extinguishing potential spread but
the heart of the firestorm continues to rage in the chamber

She backs out the crew waiting for her outside

The launcher falls loudly to the ground Ripley turns to Wren her
face rigid with pain

Wren backs up a step looking around him for protection that the others
have no thought of providing

CALL

Ripley Dont do it

Ripley stops weariness suffusing her expression

RIPLEY

Dont do what

The tension pases Wren breathes a little sigh of relief

Call PUNCHES him across the jaw his head whipping around as collapses
to the ground

Call starts down the hall not even looking at him
CALL
Dont do that

Feeling his jaw Wren actually smiles at the absurdity of all this
Its kind of winning

Christie helps him up

CHRISTIE

Had it coming Doc

Johner looks in at the burning lab

JOHNER

Whats the big deal Fucking waste of ammo

ST JUST

Lets move before anything comes to check out the noise
JOHNER

Chicks man
DISTEPHANO

We go down from here

CHRISTIE (to Vriess)

We got to lose the chair Vriess
VRIESS

I know

CHRISTIE

Kawlang maneuver all right
Vriess is pulling a coil of cords from the chair
VRIESS

Just like old times

CUT TO INT ROOM - LATER

A hatch opens Ripley drops down surveys the scene Quiet dark
empty

Ripley comes up Call behind her Ripley sniffs listens Closes her
eyes After a beat she starts further in and Call motions for others to
follow

Slowly they make their way down the corridor Ripley Cal Hillard
guns drawn

Bringing up the rear is Christie toting a shotgun He turn slowly
alert and we see that Vriess is strapped to his back facing the other
way also with a shotgun

CALL (to Ripley)

That lab 1 cant imagine how that must feel

RIPLEY

No You cant

Ripley looks down The floor here is covered with a foot or so of dark
water

Ripley steps into it moves up a few paces The others gingerly follow
Vriess is facing the back He looks up

VRIESS

The cooling tanks They must have blown during the trouble
ANGLE THE COOLING TANKS

We see the round underbelly of two huge tanks There are gaping
twisted holes in them

JOHNER

The nasties couldnt have done it could they
HILLARD

What for

WREN

Down here He is at the front with Ripley and-Call where the water is
waste deep

He looks down at a stairwell just the top of the railing visible above
the murky water

RIPLEY
Theres no other way
WREN

Were at the bottom of the ship Some of the worst damage is down
here

Most of the sections are sealed off
RIPLEY

Youre sure

WREN

Theres the noncoms entrance back there but its flooded too and
its a longer run

CALL

Hes right Were gonna have to do it this way

WREN

Its just through the kitchen then up maybe seventy feet
RIPLEY

I dont like it

ST JUST

Whats to like
CHRISTIE (to vriess)

You ready to get wet partner
VRIESS

Oh yeah

HILLARD

You sure about the distance
WREN

Yes

CALL

No locked doors

WREN

Its an open hall Just keep left when you hit the bottom of the
staircase

JOHNER
This sucks
ANGLE DI STEPHANO

He flips caps over the barrel of the gun slides a panel over the
digital readout

The burner is ready to go watertight

DISTEPHMO (to St Just)

You should secureyour weapons

St Just holds up his two guns

ST JUST

These are disposables They can take it

DISTEPHANO

Disposables I heard about those How many rounds

ST JUST

Twenty Split points give you a good hole even at the smaller caliber

DISTEPHANO
Cool
ST JUST

Theyre big with hitters Cause you throw em away after the job
Nobody likes throwing away a weapon theyre attached to You know

He smiles at Di Stephano who looks a little uneasy about the turn the
conversation has taken

He joins the others who are getting ready to dive
CALL

Do I have to tell everyone to take a deep breath
A couple of the guys smile

VRIESS

Christie do me a favor When we hit the surface on the other side
no backstroke Okay

CHRISTIE (laughing)
Youll be forever blowing bubbles On three

He counts down the two suck in enormous breaths -- and dive right
behind Call and Ripley

One by one the entire crew slips down into the black water
CUT TO INT STAIRWELLKITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Its all underwater Visiblity is poor The crew move swiftly and
gracefully down the stairs and into the kitchen

In here its a tad labyrinthian and the size of the room it darker
Wren heads straight for the other end

They swim Safety is a good fifty feet away

They are tense concentrated Swimming past dark spaces Anything
could be hiding here

Johner looks about him very nervous Dark spaces He looks behind
Three aliens are right behind him

Panic blows half the air out of his mouth as he swings around and FIRES
at them tags one as the other two swim off into shadows with horrible

ease

Ripley all the way to the stairs sees She hurries the others past
her

They swim frantically for safety Hillard Wren Christie and Vriess
Rane is coming along and alien hands grab at him from the darkness
pull him into it

Hillard FIRES in that direction Johner bringing up the rear still
firing at the third one wounding it but not scoring killshot

Call is swimming up ther staircase the growing light above indicating
the surface

She is almost to it when she is IN THE WEB

A net of translucent alien goo it is spread just six inche below the
surface

Call struggles the goo sticking to her shes running out of air -- as
Wren and Christie enconter the same thing -- they all try to tear
through it but they are getting weaker

Ripley looks back as the last of the crew is passing her aliens close
behind

She looks up to see the situation ab and quickly makes for the surface
-- but an alien GRABS her foot holding her down Now SHE is running
out of air KICKS at it it lets go

The others are fighting Call pops her stilletto and cuts through but
its tough she still cant get her head up --

--Di Stephano off to the side is drowning Takes in a huge mouthful
of water and begins thrashing

Ripley swims past everyone and grabs the hole Call cut pulls it apart
with a mighty heave she glides up through --

CLOSE UP RIPLEYS FACE

Just BREAKS the surface she takes in a huge GASP of air FACEHUGGER
CLAMPS DOWN ON HER

Ripley goes back under pulling at the thing as others break the
surface

Wren comes up and a hugger LEAPS right at him but Call nails it in
four shots

Christie and Vriess break surface and both begin FIRING back to back
in a circular sweep

They decimate a number of eggs

ANGLE UNDERWATER

Ripley pulls the face hugger with all her might -- it comes off its
fingers singeing the sides of her face leaving marks like warpaint

Worse its probing fleshy member pulls last of her throat thrashing
horribly
In utmost disgust Ripley PULLS it APART and the three aliens are
COMING RIGHT AT HER

ABOVE - THE SURFACE

Most of the crew has gotten up out of the water Christie holding a
facehugger inches from his face others screaming taking a bead on it

CHRISTIE

Get it Kill it

CALL

The blood1ll burn you Throw it

He does and Johner nails it in midflight

Hillard and Johner pull Di Stephano out of the water but he is not
breathing

ANGLE UNDER THE SURFACE

Ripley is grabbed by an alien -- and St Just comes up behind her and
shoots it

They swim up and away from the spreading lethal bloodpool
ANGLE ABOVE THE SURFACE

They come up out of the water and an alien rises right behind them
Everyone who can shoots it It falls back into the water

CHRISTIE

A trap They set a goddamn ambush
JOHNER

Give me that

He pulls the burner off Di Stephanos body even as Call is giving him
mouth to mouth

Johner flips the gun open and FIRES at the water the whole thing
SMOKING and sizzling with the electrical charge we hear an alien wail
bubble from below the surface

JOHNER (grinning feverishly)

Okay Everybody out of the pool

VRIESS

Lets get the fuck
Di Stephano sputters back to life Ripley picks him up with one hand
HILLARD (to Wren)

Which way

WREN

Up here

He takes off the others following

WREN

Up through the lift shaft

He stops at a pair of sliding doors starts working the panel Ripley
come up to the doors and pulls them apart with a grunt

ST JUST

Company

Hes refering to the noise and shadow of approaching aliens
She herds them into the shaft

cut TO INT LIFTSHAFT - CONTINUOUS

It goes down about four stories and up seemingly forever Enough room
for or three

elevators one of which is two stories below
WREN
UP

He starts climbing Its not that hard -- there are ladders in each
shaft section

Call comes up behind him Ripley and others pair off on other ladders

They climb fast theyre three stories up before the aliens begin
POUNDING on the metal door it buckles under their might

JOHNER
Move
WREN
Not far

Still POUNDING -- one alien gets its head in looks up hisses pulls
it out
ANGLE LIFT

Wren comes to a cralwspace ledge He climbs on Set back a few feet
from the shaft is a small maintenance access door works the keypad
beside it as Call climbs up behind him

The aliens SMASH through the door one of them SAILING across the shaft
to grab a pipe on the other side Instantly four of them are swarming
up the walls moving much faster on pipes and ridges than the humans
on ladders

On one of the aliens a facehugger crawls constantly moving about on
the adult aliens head like a frightened spider

CALL

Hurry

WREN

Its jammed Shit Gun

She hands him her gun and without hesitation he SHOOTS HER THROUGH THE
CHEST

She flies back and DOWN THE SHAFT lands HARD on an elevator six
stories below

Eyes wide and empty
VRIESS
NOoO

He fires up at Wren but Wren has punched in the code and slipped
through the opening door

Ripley LEAPS through the air and grabs the ledge hauling herself up
just in time to see the door shut The lock lights turn red

She SLAMS against the door but to no avail
The aliens are getting closer St Just the closest to the bottom

suddenly lets go of the ladder His knees hooked over a rung he
drops hangs up side down his guns filling his hands

He blows several holes in the nearest alien

Ripley is furious maybe surprised just how so Suddenly an alien
RISES OVER THE LEDGE its not three feet away from her and she
SCREAMS HURLS herself at it and they both go

FLYING OFF into-space they hit the wall on the other side they fall
RIPLEY GRABS a pole it practically tears her arm out of her socket but

she holds on the alien isnt so lucky it plummets unable to find
puchase We see it fall past the unmoving body of Call
ANGTE CALLS FACE
As the facehugger CLAMPS onto it Pauses Pushes off a bit two digits
probing Calls nostrils Sensing no breath the thing scurries away to

find a better host

Another alien is fast approching Christie and Vriess Vriess
frantically tries to reload

VRIESS

Its on us

Christie turns aims -- Vriess grabs the ladder as Christie FIRES but
the alien is too close it grabs Christie spurting blood all over him

He SCREAMS lets go of the ladder

Vriess takes the weight of both as Christie fires again the alien
flying off and down the shaft

HILLARD

We gotta go

The last alien suddenly starts scurrying back down after his brothers
RIPLEY

Were locked in

JOHNER

Fuck

PURVIS

How far to the next door

DISTEPHANO

All the way

RIPLEY

Then we climb

They start moving as fast as they can
VRIESSS (to Christie)

You just hang on man Ill get us there

He starts climbing up impressively fast considering the burden hanging
from his back

JOHNER (to Ripley)
Are they going for reinforcements
RIPLEY

Fucked if I know

They climb

And climb the minutes stretching out still no door Ripley easily
ahead of the rest

Finally

RIPLEY

I think I see the door
PURVIS (exhausted)
Great

Vriess is having increasing trouble Hillard notices him lagging
behind and why

HILLARD
Vriess Jesus

Vriess is moving very quickly considering But the effort is becoming
too much

VRIESS

Were coming

Johner scrambles down next to Vriess

he checks the pulse in Christies neck

Vriess man hes dead

Refusing to hear it Vriess struggles to climb further
VRIESS

Well get him to medlab just a little while

Johner looks over at Hillard Without saying a word she pull out a
good-sized hunting knife flicks it open

She slices through the cord holding them together and Christies body
falls free

Vriess shuts his eyes feeling it ANGLE DOWN THE SHAFT

There is silence as Christies body drops down the black abyss
Until from up the shaft next to where he fell we see two ALIENS
COMING UP

PURVIS

Fuck Company

Hillard looks up the shaft

HILLARD

How much further

JOHNER

Too fucking far Lets GO

They start to climb but the aliens are making much better time

A loud CLACKING sounds from the bottom of the shaft A few of them
look down

ANGLE DOWN THE SHAFT

The aliens are still coming but suddenly the lift passes them heading
up at high speed

JOHNER

They can work the elevators Is there anything fucking else we should
know about them

Hes addressing this at Ripley but shes as puzzled as the rest of
them

The lift comes up to them stops suddenly as emergency brake is
flipped

They wait guns ready Out of the hatch pops Call not especially dead
CALL

Get on

A moment of stunned silence then they all jump on top of the lift
Call drops back down inside

An alien comes up level with the lift prepares to jump St Just
shoots the shit out of it

HILLARD
Where are the others

CuT TO INT LIFT - CONTINUOUS
Call flips the brake off and the lift shoots up She is holding her
jacket closed around her chest wound but it doesnt seem to bother
her particularly much

ANGLE ON TOP

Everybody holds on as the lift flies up the shaft

ANGLE INSIDE

Call waits for the signal to stop and an alien PUNCHES THROUGH the
bottom of the lift Call yells as it gets its head and an arm through
clawing for her

ANGLE ON THE BOTTOM

We see the other half of the alien clinging to the lift

ANGLE ON TOP

Ripley sees the door approaching

RIPLEY

stop

ANGLE INSIDE

Call hits the emergency button and the lift stops halfway in front of
the door -

- giving both Ripley and Call access Bu the alien is still grabbing
for her --

Ripley pries open the doors again the crew pouring out into the hall
Ripley follows jumps down and opens the lift doors

The alien hisses at Ripley as she pulls Call out -- the -alien grabs
Calls ankle but

Ripley wrenches her free

They roll out but the alien is still fighting Pulling itself inside
the lift

Ripley grabs Hillardls shotgun Levels it at the cables holding the
lift FIRES

The lift PLUMMIETS the alien still halfway in

It shoots down the shaft -- picking up the second alien on its way
down neither beast able to get its bearing and get out of the way as--

The lift SMASHES into the bottom of the shaft crushing both the Aliens
to jelly
ANGLE UPPER DOOR
Johner triumphantly sticks his head in the shaft

JOHNER

Eat that fucknec

They all breathe hard exhausted before they can muster for the next
stretch

Call stands with her back to them
VRIESS

Baby am I glad to see you I thought dickbag took you out for sure
Are you hurt

CALL

Im fine

DISTEPHANO

You got body armour on
CALL

Yeah Come on

Ripley isnt buying
RIPLEY

You were Gunshot I saw
CALL

Ripley spins her around Call stares at Ripley sullenly a small
trickle of milky white fluid comes from her nostril Ripley looks down

ANGLE CALLS CHEST

Wren has indeed made a messy hole here but where blood and bone should
be there is a tangle of synthorganic wiring To state the obvious

A robot

JOHNER

Calls a goddam sythetic
HILLARD

Son of a bitch Little Annalees just full of surprises
RIPLEY (quietly)

I should have known

ST JUST

RIPLEY

No I mean all that crap about being human - theres no one so
zealous as a Born Again

VRIESS (to Call)

Youre an LM7 arent you Is that it
CALL

Her voice shocks her more than anyone her vocal track slip affected by
the wounds

The voice is a shade slow and echoes strangely
VRIESS

Call

CALL (bitterly)

Yes

ST JUST

LM7 Shit That explains a lot

YRIESS (to Ripley)

industy

PURVIS (getting anxious)

Vriess tries to touch Calls wound

VRIESS

Call pulls away

JOHNER

RIPLEY

That convinces Call She pulls up her sleeve and begins pushes a
part of her forearm

just below the crook of her elbow It has a spring release catch and
a small panel rises

up with two computer ports on it She takes the cable from Ripley and
plugs it in

It looks almost like shes mainlining heroin
She cocks her head

CALL

The Garden runs nearly half a mile straight across and then down on a
terraced slope

Everywhere are different kinds of plants trees vegetable plants
exotic and experimental hybrids

Access paths crisscross the beds

Its huge the single biggest space on the ship Yet the low ceiling
laticed with grow-lamps now dim in nightcycle and prodigeous
undergrowth make it labyrinthian almost claustrophobic

From where the crew is they can barely see where it slopes down
JOHNER

Whats this fucking deal

DISTEPHMO

This supplies most of the food for the unit

VRIESS (holding a lucious ripe pear)

You guys got something against spam

DISTEPHMO

And theres some lab work here too Hybridization

RIPLEY

At the other end

DISTEPHMO

Runs down to the by the waste tanks We can get to the dock from
there You okay

Ripley is holding her head She shuts her eyes
CALL

What is it

Ripley shakes it off

RIPLEY

Nothing Im okay

She looks out at the jungle they have to cross
CALL

We should get moving
ST JUST
Hey Check it out

He has come upon a small loading truck a sort of platform jeep
Vriess checks it out takes a huge bite of his pear

VRIESS

Beats walking

He hauls himself up-into it Everybody piles onto the back flatbed just
a foot or so off the ground and just big enough to hold everyone but
Vriess Call and Ripley who pushes into the drivers seat

VRIESS

Quickly and quietly people

Ripley stares unconprehendingly at the controls for a momen till Call
flips on the ignition

RIPLEY
Thank you

The jeep pulls out Its electric so it emits just a low hum as she
takes it at a good clip toward the other side

The access paths are just a bit wider than the jeep itself plants
rising tall all around them

Ripley concentrates on driving

The pass through as section of wheat then of corn As they come to
another section

The crews expressions change to one of pleased disbelief
You gotta be fucking me St Just Is this real

ST JUST

So this is what heaven looks like

We see they have driven into a healthy section of CANNABIS plants
growing ten feet high

The car screeches to a halt Ripleys at a crossroads of sorts
RIPLEY
Which way

HILLARD (looking at the plants)
I always wondered where the military got its funding

An alien SHOOTS out of the brush and lands on Hillard everyone SCREAMS
-- Ripley SLAMS her foot on the pedal

The jeep PEELS OUT as more emerge from the brush

HILLARD

Get it off MeeeaaaaAAGGHRE

It bores into her head before St Just can blow it away Its head
exploding in fragments of bone and sizzling blood as it falls away from

the jeep Hillards body still clutched in arms

Another leaps out at them but the jeep is going a good clip and it
misses

The crew peppering it with bullets

They lookabout them guns ready

ANGLE IN THE BRUSH

Something runs parallel to them in the plants

ANGLE ABOVE

Two more run on top of the grow-lamps pacing them as well

One DROPS DOWN -- Ripley SWERVES out of the way driving in the plants
They are varied exotic -- and there are aliens behind half of them

The crew BLASTS away all around them Ripley drives a drunkards path
through the brush avoiding trees that dot the scape

An alien DROPS onto the hood another grabs the side -- Vries takes out
the first blowing it off but the second grabs Johner he goes flying

over the sidedropping his gun

St Just is too preoccupied with his own problems on the othe to see
that Johner is being

dragged the alien still clutching onto him

Shots bang out ripping into the alien which lets go Johner looks up
to see Purvis holding Johners gun

Johner drags himself back on

One jumps down onto St Just tears a good chunk out of his midsection
before he dusts it

Another alien jumps on the hood just as the jeep SAILS over first ledge
of the terraced slope comes-down hard enough knock it off SAILS over
the next -- the crew can barely hang on as the jeep crashes down slope
after slope

Ripley swerves back onto the road the jeep sliding over onto the steps
beside it rocking violently as they shoot down the remainder of slope
the aliens close on their heels

Still blasting away at the beasts the crew is able to put little
distance between them as they come to the end of the garden Here it
divides into three sections all open halls with access for the jeep
RIPLEY

Which way

DISTEPRMO (looking over)

Left Left

She swerves left the jeep-bouncing into the hall

INT HALL CONTINUOUS

Where windows running along either side look out onto black space

Ripley drives as far as she can till a staircase -- going -- fills her
vision too steep

a halt

Skittering insectile motion at one end heralds the aliens as two of

Scuttling through a small maze the aliens come out into

INT WASTE TANK 5 - CONTINUOUS

A vast dark chamber entirely encrusted with alien goo air vent opens
about three quarters of the way up the chamber The aliens pour out and
imediately scuttle UP carrying Ripley to the top of the chamber

They circle her and begin secreting resin spinning a web around her

The resin comes out of ther backs in spits and globs

It isnt pleasant and Ripley struggles feebly as they begin to cocoon
her

CALL

PURVIS

Ive been saying that all day we need your help
A moment more and she heads out with him

CUT TO WASTE TANK 5 - CONTINUOTJS
The aliens have finished webbing Ripley and climb away

When it is done she finds herself basically hung from the ceiling her
legs encased and glued with glistening strands to the roof She hangs
therefore at an angle looking down on the chamber

And so it is with her as she swims to full consciousness we get our
first real look at where we are

There are no less than ten people strung up exactly as Ripley is
encircling the chamber and all looking some forty feet down at

The Queen Lying on her back at the bottom of the-chamber belly
swollen and distended

She is herself partially cocooned strapped down to the at the edge of
a black pool of blood and ichor Her head moves slowly back and forth
in delierium of pain

There are a four or five aliens tending her spinning goo around her
vomiting blood onto her belly They might be serving her or
imprisoning her Both in fact

There is one thing missing from this tableau
RIPLEY (softly)

No eggs

GEDIMAN (OS)

Multiple reproductive systems

Ripley turns slowly to see the person next to her Its Gediman
looking wane and haggard

He may be speaking to her but he stares straight ahead his eyes
glowing with near insanity

GEDIMAN
Complete asexual reproductive cycle self-impregnating we found six
different sets of ovaries in her Egg laying is the first cycle
immature Redundancies redundancies

Now he looks at her regret and glee at what has happened battling for
his expression

GEDIMAN
No theyve just been draining me
She looks down to see

As blood from various wounds seeps slowly past his toes dripping into
the pool

A keening SHRIEK comes out of the queen as her limbs begin thrashing

The aliens around her back off slightly

The bulge in her belly starts moving

Ripley is frantically trying to pull at her bonds Its just beginning

does as well from effort or sympathy it is hard to tell as

THE QUEENS BELLY POPS OPEN Blood shoots everywhere burning into the
walls

And all the screaming stops The movement stops Even Ripley stops
Silence

Something emerges from the wound

An alien to be sure but nothing weve seen so far its forelegs arch
out of its back like spiders legs its back legs set on enormous
haunches thick and powerful

Its head is long eyeless like the others but along its white expanse
red veins coming out of the skin and running like thick black hairs to
the back

It has retracted pincers at the side of head that come out when its
tongue does

Its much bigger the the others nearly the size of the queen herself
And its bone white

GEDIMAN

Beautiful beautiful butterfly

He is crying with revelatory joy Ripley is not Grimacing the sight
and smell of the new beast she begins pulling again at her bonds

One of the soldiers at the other end of the room from Ripley wakes
up

Dangling uselessly at his side is a rifle -- the real deal not a
burner

SOLDIER
No God

He SCREAMS in uncomprehending horror The newborn stops tilting its
head

It LEAPS up to the ceiling in a second quick and effortless as a
monstrous flea

Leaps again and lands on the screaming soldier gripping his sides with
its four forelegs as he screams lustily

pincers SWING out and pin either side of his head His eyes go wide
as

Its tongue SHOOTS into his throat Stays there and we watch it drain

Purvis is a man possessed He grabs Wrens gunhand and SMAS it against
an instrument panel bone cracking audibly as wren drops the gun

Purvis jerks Blood blooms in his chest
Everybody stops mesmerized wren drops to his knees going for the
gun and Purvis grabs him from behind pulls him so that the back of

Wrens head is against his chest

Purvis jerks again It takes Wren a moment to understand whats

bonds with a terrible effort -- the newborn LEAPS at her and she PULLS
FREE with a scream PLUNGING the thirty feet to the pool as the alien
flies over her missing landing on the far wall instead

Ripley disappears beneath the surface of the water

The newborn turns its head trying to locate its lost prey other
aliens scutter closer to the pool

Ripley stands up out of the pool covered in blood HOISTING THE

Killshriek rising from her throat as she FIRES taking out a host of
aliens in a single sweep just tagging the newborn as it leaps out of
the way Aliens jump at her trying to kill and trying to protect the
newborns but she blows them out of the air

It feels pretty good

A few shots go wild and punch big holes in the side of the tank

Light streams in through them Ripley sees -- and continues firing in

Huge loping She jumpsdown off the ship
And runs
Through the blur of trees she moves with the grace and speed of an

animal leaping from boulders racing through the powdered brush this
is Ripley at peak speed and it is something to see
She starts going up the way getting steeper and rockier til she
reaches a cliff face and looks out on

A CITY

Sprawling huge a million tiny lights cutting through the darknes its
just before the horizon

The newborn RISES in front of Ripley STRIKES her before she has a
chance to aim her weapon

Its tentacle cuts deeply into her sends her flying

The beast is on her in a second its enormous jaws missing her head by
an inch as she rolls grabs the grenade launcher FIRE

off another shot it SLAMS a foot down RIGHT ON HER she SCREAMS the
launcher rolls free the beast coming in for the kill and over the
ridge FLIES THE HARVESTER Call at the controls aiming right for the

It rears up to see it just as the girl RAMS it into the creatures head
it knocks it on its ass the harvester shaking but not quite spinning
out as Call comes around for another shot

Ripley scrambles to safety as the Newborn prepares for the oncoming
harvester it whips its tentacles at it but Call swerves at the last
second -- The monster spins with it screaming sees Ripley and slashes
at her KNOCKS HER OFF THE CLIFF --

The newborn spins and she SLAMS into it it goes flying screaming in
pain the harvester bouncing off it flipping over CRASHING against
the trees and landing tilted upside down Call unconscious between it
and the ground

The newborn shudders rises makes for the harvester -- it clearly
pissed

Ripley pulls herself over the ridge sees the situation rushes toward
them

Call awakens to see the monster approaching the machine Terrified
but determined she reaches for a lever

RIPLEY

No Over here

Calling out to distract it she runs waving her arms

Tears run through her voice as she strains for the lever The beast is
torn and for a moment doesnt move

Ripley looks over to where Call is and understanding blooms on her
face

She looks around and spots

Halfway between her and the newborn

For a moment neither of them moves Then Ripley RUNS the newborn
comes at her with equal speed like theyre playing chicken Ripley
DIVES at the ground rolls comes up holdin the grenade launcher and

she FIPES

The newborn is hit up close and dead center this time and it rears
back screaming -

- Ripley FIRES and FIRES driving it back toward the upended harvester

The alien rears up to its full height and Ripley pullsthe trigger
There is a hollow click

Furious Ripley stares a moment at the beast A SSCREAM wells up in
her throat and she

THROWS herself at it leaping impossibly high smashing into it and
sending both of them tumbling onto the Harvester

Call pulls the lever

In an instant the machine roars to life a thousand blades grinding to
top speed pulverizing the beast consuming it sucking it down as
layer upon layer of alien flesh is chopped into messes

And it SHRIEKS a noise unheard before as it thrashes frantically
Ripley tries to pull herself off it before the blades get too close --
but the beast grabs her holds her The blades ever closer as she
struggles with it

ANGLE CALL

Still trapped below she sees the aliens blood seeping through the
machine all around her

She squirms trying to get away but shes stuck A stream of blood
lands on her shoulder eating it away Another on her leg and panic
blooms bright in her

CALL

RIPLEY

Galvanized by the cry Ripley TEARS herself out of the beasts dying
grasp flips backwards off the Harvester as it begins to smoke and
spark blood eating through the controls

Call writhes blood everywhere now She is lost in primal terror

Ripley wriggles her way under and regardless of the streams of blood
splattering her wrenchs Call free She drags her out

A section of the harvester explodes raining fire and debris or the
dying alien

Call lies on the ground Ripley behind her arms wrapped tight around
her

Covered in blood and grime the two watch the alien go up in flames
breathing hard holding each other as if their lives depended on it
still

DISSOLVE TO- ANGLE THE NEWBORNS SKULL

Burning hollowed out by the licks of flame that caress it Collapsing
gently on itself

WIDE ANGLE

EXT SAME - LATER

The four of them sit by the huge camp-fire watching the flames
Vriess tosses Christie a bottle of whiskey

JOHNER

The bitch takes her time in burning
VRIESS
Well it looks like shes finally giving it up
JOHNER

Troopers should be finding our ship any time now 1 dont much love the
idea of being around when they do

Ripley gets up looks out over the cliffs edge at the lights the city
Christie offers the bottle to Call She takes it and drinks

VRIESS (to Call)

I guess you wont want to be answering any official Questions either
CALL

I guess not

She is grateful for the suggestion that they are in it together
VRIESS

Well were on Earth for Chrissake Plenty of places to get lost here
CALL

So Ive heard

After a moment she gets up as well goes over to Ripley She hands
her the bottle

Ripley looks at it

CALL

Its a drink You drink it

RIPLEY (smiling) I remember She drinks
CALL

So what do you think

RIPLEY

Think

CALL

What should we do now

RIPLEY
I dont know
She looks out in the distance
RIPLEY Im a stranger here myself

The two of them stand side by side staring out at the unfamiliar
horizon as the newborn dwindles in the dancing flame

THE END
