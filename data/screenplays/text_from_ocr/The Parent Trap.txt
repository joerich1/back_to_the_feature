THE PARENT TRAP
FADE IN

EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD - SOUTHERN MAINE - DAY

A caravan of THREE CAMP BUSES with the name CAMP WALDEN FOR GIRLS
emblazoned on their sides climb a tree-lined road The Buses turn down a narrow lane and
pass through a freshly painted wooden gate as the CAMERA RISES giving us a sweeping
view of beautiful CAMP WALDEN A magnificent lake sparkles in the distance with red
canoes lined up on its shores over this quiet serenity we HEAR the Bus HORNS
HONKING to announce the first day of camp has officially begun

EXT MAIN LODGE - CAMP WALDEN

Girls Girls Girls Tall ones short ones and everything in between Some carry pillows
others carry stuffed animals all wear backpacks There are more pony-tails swinging at
this moment than you can imagine Teenage Counselors try to control the pandemonium
without much luck The only men in sight the Bus Drivers toss duffel bags out of the
buses and into a large pile

MARVA KULP the owner of the Camp late sixties four and a half feet tall wearing khaki
shorts talks through a BULLHORN Next to her stands her daughter and first lieutenant
MARVA JR just under six feet tanned and humorless She also holds a BULL-HORN

MARVA SR
(into bull-horn)
Good morning ladies and welcome to Camp Walden Im Marva your Camp Director and
this is my daughter and right hand man Marva Jr Girls please find your duffels as quickly

Marva Jr lifts her BULL-HORN and starts barking out bunk assignments right into her
Mothers ear Marva Sr covers her ears in pain

MARVA JR
Berg Kate Iroquois bunk seven Berg Lily Chickasaw bunk five
(we HEAR a SCREAM of joy) Burnham Daisy Kickapoos bunk three

A MOUNTAIN OF DUFFEL BAGS sits on the quad as one eleven year-old Hallie Parker
pops up from behind the huge pile

Hallie
(to herself)

okay found my duffel now the question is how do I get it out

Hallie wears overalls a baseball cap that says Girls Rule sunglasses and a sweat-shirt tied
around her waist Her ears are pierced her hair is short she wears bright red high tops and
metallic blue nail polish

Hallie
(finding her duffel bag strap)
Okay I can do it

Hallie pulls on the strap with all her might her face turning bright red

Hallie
Okay no I cant

A skinny kid with a long neck ZOE steps in carrying her duffel bag on her shoulder and
chewing gum

ZOE
You must be new

Hallie
How can you tell

ZOE
You didnt know to grab your duffel before the apes tossed it into the heap I would say
you need some serious help

Hallie
Thanks its the big blue one

ZOE

(helps Hallie pull on the
strap)

Cool hat

Hallie
Thanks it was a going away gift from my Dad

As Zoe and Hallie pull on the strap together the Bus Drivers
toss another half-dozen new duffels onto the pile Hallie and

Zoe shoot the Bus Drivers a look Just then NICOLE a strapping ten year-old in a tie-dye
T-shirt beads and a bandana around her head arrives and easily pulls her duffel from the
center of the pile

Hallie
Now thats my kind of woman

ZOE

(cups hands around her mouth)
Hey Tie-Dye girl

Nicole turns around

Hallie
Would you mind giving me a hand My duffells the red one way in there

Nicole nods and drops her duffel It LANDS right on Zoes foot

Hallie

ZOE
(grabbing her foot)
That would be negative

Nicole yanks Hallies duffel out of the pile and drops it on Zoes other foot
ZOE

The Girls slap hands and head off toward their bunk
Hallie

(Nicole and Zoe shake their
heads)

No Thats a shame So tell me how much cash did you guys bring with you this summer

As the Girls walk off CAMERA BOOMS UP to a LIMOUSINE pulling up in front of the
MAIN LODGE Heads turn as the Driver in a dark suit and cap hops out and opens the
limousines back door Out steps a PROPER BRITISH BUTLER perfect posture elegant
grey suit extremely proper demeanor His name is MARTIN and he speaks with a stuffy
ENGLISH ACCENT

Martin leans into the back-seat and takes the hand of an elegantly dressed eleven year-old
Annie James Annie wears a powder blue suit and carries a purse and a small vanity

case Her hair is perfectly neat shoulder length and worn with a powder blue head

band As Annie turns to Martin we see her face and we realize SHE LOOKS ECACTLY
LIKE Hallie Parker Same hair color same eyes same nose same mouth same height
same weight Identical in every way

MARTIN
Well here we are - Camp Walden For
Girls

(looks around with disdain)
We travelled six thousand miles for this
Annie looks around She also speaks with a BRITISH ACCENT
Annie
Its rather picturesque wouldnt you
say

MARTIN

I dont know if thats precisely the term
I would use
Annie smiles as the Limo Driver lines up four pieces of matching luggage by Martins side
MARTIN

MARTIN
Oh and heres a little something from your
Grandfather a brand new deck of cards
Maybe youll find someone on this continent
who can actually whip your tush at poker

Annie
I doubt it but thanks And thanks for
bringing me Martin

Martin is suddenly overwhelmed with emotion He looks away about to burst into tears
quickly grabs Annie hugs her tightly then just as quickly - regains his dignity

MARTIN
And remember if you change your mind and want me to pick you up at the end of camp
Im only a phone-call away

Annie
Ill be fine See you in eight weeks
Marty ol’ pal

MARTIN
Eight weeks it is Queen of my Heart

Annie puts out her hand Martin places his hand over hers and they proceed to do an
extravagantly worked out SECRET HANDSHAKE - with all kinds of moves in it including
a butt bump a wave under the chin and a shimmy to-and-fro When its over Martin
resumes his proper Butler demeanor and gets into the Limo As the Limo pulls away we

INT DINING HALL - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

A hundred and fifty Girls all in camp uniforms have arrived for dinner Two lines of Girls
approach a central buffet table

IN ONE LINE we find Hallie IN THE OTHER LINE headed right toward her is
Annie Both Annie and Hallie are busy talking to their friends and dont notice each other

As Annie reaches the front of the line and approaches the buffet table Hallie does the
same For a split second they stand directly next to each other Just as they are about to
see each other Marva Sr steps between them with a plate full of food

MARVA SR
Excuse me girls Ive just got to have

INT SHOWER HOUSE - LATER THAT EVENING

Hallie ENTERS a shower stall and begins washing her hair She wears a small GOLD
LOCKET around her neck A beat later Annie ENTERS the stall next to her and turns on
the water She wears the IDENTICAL LOCKET The Girls can not see each other over
the partition Hallie drops her soap and it slides into Annies stall Annie reaches over the
partition and hands the soap back to Hallie

Annie
Here you go
Hallie
Got it Thanks

As their FINGERS TOUCH they both STAND FROZEN for a moment a current of
some sort running between them They each TURN AND LOOK AT THEIR TOUCHING
HAMS Then they both let go Hallie lifts her locket sucks on it Annie does -the exact
same thing as she turns off the water

EXT CAMP - THE FOLLOWING DAY

A FENCING MATCH Two Girls each wearing nylon jackets and wire-mesh masks are in
the middle of a duel The First Girl is whipping the Seconds butt knocking her sword out
of her hand and pinning her against the wall The other Campers applaud and cheer

Both Girls take off their masks and we see Hallie is the victor

MARVA JR

Touche Excellent girls

(raises Hallies arm)

The winner and still undefeated champ Hallie Parker

Hallie takes a bow and moves off with her-friends Annie
Crosby and Jackie pass by in time to

MARVA JR
Do we have any challengers

Annie
(pulling on a mask)
Sure Ill take a whack at it

She snaps on a vest flips the sword into the air and catches it then nods to Marva Jr

MARVA JR
(blows her whistle)
En garde

Hallie still in her mask turns to see Annie in her mask and vest Annie SALUTES briskly
with her sword Hallie hesitates then does the same They stand on guard looking like

bookends Marva Jr blows the whistle again and

THE DUEL BEGINS
Hallie lunges Annie parries then attacks Hallie tries to knock the sword out of Annies
hand but Annie deflects the blade whirls around and lunges Point for Annie

Hallie gets the jump on Annie and comes in low Point
Hallie lunges but Annie catches her sword and sweeps it in a full circle pulling them
together mask-to-mask They break

Hallie charges but Annie side-steps and Hallie runs past her Hallie stops and whips around
to find Annie lunging toward her Hallie steps back loses her balance and falls butt-first
into a WATER TROUGH landing with a huge splash The Campers explode with
laughter

Annie reaches out to help Hallie but Hallie grabs Annies hand and yanks her into the
trough The Campers crack-up as the two Girls sit soaking side-by-side They climb out
together and angrily pull off their masks Annie tosses her long hair as Hallie shakes her
short hair dry

MARVA JR
Looks like we got ourselves a new camp champ Miss Annie James Letsshake hands

Neither girl turns around

MARVA JR

her handAnnie reaches for it

CLOSE ANGLE - THEIR HANDS

as they touch something electric again passes between them

Annie AND Hallie

look down at their hands then up at each other not knowing what to say Just then their
friends join them and they immediately slip their hands into their pockets - at the same
time Their friends stop in their tracks and look from Annie to Hallie - stunned at the
resemblance The lunch bell RINGS and everyone else on the lawn runs toward the Mess
Hall
Hallie

NICOLE
(stops looking up at the roof
of their bunk)

FIGURES run silently toward Annies bunk

INT ANNIES BUNK - NIGHT

CAMERA PANS past a sleeping Jackie Crosby and Annie The door squeaks open and
Hallie steps inside She signals the coast is clear and Nicole and Zoe tip-toe in carrying
strange

unidentifiable objects They all quickly go to work and we SEE A jar of HONEY is
opened and poured into a pair of Addidas A can of SHAVING CREAM is squirted onto a
pillow-case

A ball of TWINE is wound around a bedpost then zigzagged across the room

An industrial-size can of CHOCOLATE M UP is emptied into a bucket
WESSON OIL is poured all over the floor

CUT TO

MORNING - A SLEEPY SEVEN YEAR-OLD WITH A BUGLE
plays reveille badly

INT ANNIES BLINK - FOLLOWING MORNING

The bunk looks like one giant spider web Mazes of string everywhere The sound of
EMILLE reverberates through the room as the Girls get out of bed slide in the Wesson Oil
get stuck in the honey trip over the string lots of yelling and screaming Annie stands
dripping in shaving cream

Annie

Shes without a doubt the lowest most awful creature that ever walked the planet
EXT ANNIES BUNK - SAME TIME

She starts to OPEN the door not realizing shes PULLING on a string attached to a
BUCKET thats about to tip right over her head Hallies eyes shoot up to the bucket then
back to Marva Sr

No really let go of that door Iinsist Shes highly contagious

Annie

CHOCOLATE Marva Jr SCREAMS slipping in the syrup and tumbling down the
stairs Marva Sr turns to Hallie slowly wiping the syrup from her eyes OVER we
HEAR

MARVA SR (V0)

INT MARVAIS TENT - MOMENTS LATER

Annie and Hallie stand side-by-side as Marva Sr paces in front of them holding a towel
still wiping off chocolate Marva Jr stands at her side also spotted in chocolate
MARVA SR
-- That little stunt was the most revolting display of hooliganism ever to take place on these
hollowed grounds

MARVA JR
A-men

MARVA SR
And worst of all coming from two sisters who should be setting an example for the entire

Annie

were not sisters maam

Marva Sr turns looks at them

Hallie

-- Weve never even seen each other

MARVA JR
(sotto)

MARVA JR
(under her breath)
Uh-oh

The Girls both bite their lockets nervously awaiting their fate as MUSIC BEGINS

EXT CAMP GROUNDS - A LITTLE LATER (MUSIC OVER)

The Two Marvas lead Annie and Hallie away from their bunks and up a long winding

hill Hallie balances her duffel bag -on her shoulder as Annie struggles her full of
luggage The rest of the Girls and we mean the ENTIRE CAMP marches in a line behind
them

INT ISOLATION BUNK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The Two Marvas catch their breath as they lead Annie and Hallie into a bunk with just two
cots and two trunks

The Marvas exit leaving Annie and Hallie alone and worse with each other Annie lifts
her suitcases onto the bed and neatly starts unpacking her things Hallie on the other hand
flips

open her trunk unzips her duffel and shakes her things out like shes emptying a bag of
potato chips into a bowl

A SIGN

that reads Isolation Table - Do Not Disturb CAMERA TILTS DOWN to see Annie and
Hallie eating at a table in the MESS KUL directly under the sign They are separate from
the other Campers and eat without speaking Annie eats a well balanced meal while she
reads a book as Hallie munches on a cheeseburger and plays Game Boy They never look
at each other

misunderstanding Anyway Mom can be unbelievably stubborn when she wants to be

INT HALLIES ROOM

Sunny warmly furnished with lots of books CDs Horse Show ribbons and toys The

French doors are wide open and a gentle breeze billows the curtains

Annie-
Who’s the blonde
CHESSY
Hal its none of my business how your father makes a fool out of himself you
understand Hes a big boy he can do what he wants

Annie
Right So who is she

CHESSY

Her names Meredith Blake Shes a publicist from San Francisco Your father hired her at
the beginning of the summer to do some publicity for the vineyard and if you ask me shes
done a better job selling herself than the grapes

Annie
Whaddya mean

CHESSY

Look you and I )mow your Dads no suave debonair Bachelor of the Month-type so I
wonder what a young hot thing like her sees in a guy who walks around with his shirt-tail
hanging out and his cereal bowl full of chili Then I realized theres a million reasons why
that girls giggling and theyre all sitting in the Napa Valley Community Bank

Annie
You mean you dont think she even really likes Dad

CHESSY

-- What do Iknow But Ill tell you one thing This one could give Sharon Stone femme
fatal lessons Shes got your father eating out of the palm of her hand They ride together
they swim together theyre out to dinner every night Not to mention she treats yours truly
like the shlepper help of all time which has really endeared her to me as you can imagine
you go down and meet her and see for yourself Dont let me influence you

INT LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Annie bounds down the stairs wearing sunglasses and a faded
Parker Vineyards T-shirt over a bathing suit- She looks
Around sees lots of PHOTOGRAPHS of Nick and Hallie when
Hallie was a baby

Annie
(admiring a photo)
We were such a cute baby
Shes distracted when she HEARS Merediths LAUGH Annie lowers her sunglasses
peering over them at Meredith lounging by the pool ogling Nick

EXT POOL

Annie joins Nick and Meredith under an umbrella The vineyards and mountains cascade
down from the pool creating an incredible vista

Annie

Nick pauses

MEREDITH (jumping in)
Youre home-coming of course

Nick and Meredith exchange a quick look which is not lost on Annie Nick heads toward
the house as Annie sits by the pool dunking her feet in the water A cell-phone RINGS
Meredith flips it open

MERIDITH

Hello Yes Reverend Mosby Uh-huh Ill certainly ask him but I doubt if hell be

(snaps phone shut)

So How was camp Hal Was it fabulous

Annie
Yes I loved it actually My Dads going out of the country When

MERIDITH

No no I just had to say that to get him out of something

(changing the subject)

You know I never heard a man talk about his daughter the way Nicky talks about you You
two are obviously incredibly close

Annie
Were closer than close Were all each other has

Annie does a huge cannonball into the pool SPLASHING water all over Meredith Pissed
but controlling it Meredith walks to the edge of the pool picks up a towel and pats herself
dry as Annie POPS to the surface

Annie
Sorry did I get you wet Mer
MEREDITH (trying to be sweet) just a little Hal

(then)

Hey guess what Your Dad took me riding the other day and he let me ride your horse I
hope thats okay with you

Annie

Oh sure Sprouts used to strange women riding her Not that youre strange or anything-
Actually compared to the others you seem relatively normal

(she floats on her back)

MEREDITH

(curiosity getting the best of
her walks to Annie)
Others What others

Annie
What others Puh-leeze
(laughs hysterically sees
Merediths concern)

You want the 411

MEREDITH
The 411

Annie
The ‘information’ the lowdown on the other women Cant say that I blame you Id want
to know if I was number twentyeight I mean number twenty-nine in a mans life

MERIDITH
Im number twenty-nine

Annie

Well yes but I didnt start counting ‘til I was about four God knows how many there were
before then its always the same routine horseback riding through the vineyards long
romantic dinners with his special reserve label wine moonlight swims

(Meredith nods intrigued)

But I always say its none of my business if a man his age wants to make a fool out of
himself Although maybe hes changed and youre the real thing Mer

Just then Nick arrives with a bottle of Champagne
NICK
okay here we go A bottle of my special reserve label You girls find something to talk
about while I was gone

Annie smiles and dives under the water just like a little angel

NICK
Does that mean yes

MERIDIITH

Annie
Basically

MEREDITH

You know I remember what it was like to be eleven I had my first beau at eleven Its
a wonderful age Youre starting to feel like a woman and believe it or not soon Youll
understand what its like to be in love

Annie
Me I dont think so I dont even have my twelve year-old molars yet

MEREDITH
Well take it from someone who got their molars very early in life being in love is a
fantastic mystery that takes a man and woman on a magical journey to a place
Annie
-- I dont mean to be jerky when youre trying to be all mushy and everything but I think I
know what mystery my Dad sees in you

MEREDITH
You do

Annie
Youre young and beautiful and sexy and hey the guys only human But if you ask me
marriage is supposed to be based on something more than just sex right

ITH
Boy your father underestimates you

Annie
But you wont will you Meredith
They study each other carefully

MEREDITH

So what if Im young and beautiful Thats not a crime you know And for your
information I adore your father Hes exactly-the kind of man I always planned on
marrying This is the real deal honey and nothing you do is going to come between

as The reality is angel you are no longer the only girl in Nick Parkers life Get over it

Annie
If this is the real deal then my Dads money has nothing do with you wanting to marry
him right

76

MEREDITH
I hope youre not suggesting Im marrying your father for his money

Annie

All I know is Ive seen Cinderella a few zillion times and Id rather not end up scrubbing
the floors and befriending all the birds in the neighborhood while youre having breakfast in
bed if you get my drift

MEREDITH
You are unbelievably out of line young lady
(rising)
Now you listen and listen good Im marrying your father in two weeks whether you like it
or not So I suggest you do not tangle with me anymore Youre in way over your-head is
that clear

wearing back-pack and baseball caps Theyre followed by Meredith puffing and
perspiring dabbing sunscreen on her nose as she tries to keep her balance Nick brings up
the rear Meredith plops down on a rock trying to catch her breath

MEREDITH

LIZARD She SCREAMS tossing the Evian bottle in the air losing her balance and
SLIPPING off the rock

ground Meredith sneaks up behind them and OVERHEARS

Annie

together Meredith stoops picks up two sticks CLACKS them together and follows

A CRACKLING CAMP FIRE THAT NIGHT

who sits on a rock wrapped in a blanket swatting at mosquitos and rubbing lotion on her
arm

NICK
We always live off the trail up here its part of the experience

MEREDITH
(swatting away)
Whats the other part being eaten to death by mosquitos

Youd think they actually liked this stuff

NICK
What is that youre using (looks at the bottle puts some on his hand)
Youre going to attract every mosquito on the mountain This is sugar and water Where’d

Meredith looks to the Girls who busy themselves eating

MEREDITH
