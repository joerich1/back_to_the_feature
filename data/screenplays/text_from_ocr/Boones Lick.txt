EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI PLAINS AND FOREST DAY SPRING 1
1866

TWO HORSEMEN trot along through country that is mainly

forested though with frequent patches ef plain

SETH CECIL forty-ish wears a mashed up union cavalryman’s
cap carries a sharpshooter’s rifle in an oil cloth sheath
Keeps an eye on the ground tracks in a hasty kind of way
With him is his appealing sixteen-year-old nephew SHAY
(short for SHERMAN) CECIL His old felt hat has a hole in
it he carries an ancient single-shot rifle

SETH draws rein Sniffs the air Puts his horse into a
gallop

SHAY follows

EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI FOREST DAY A MINUTE LATER 2

SETH draws rein once again as does SHAY Gestures to his
nephew to keep quiet

Cautious they creep through the trees

Stop just short of a clearing while they are still hidden by
the forest

EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI MILLER CAMP DAY CONTINUOUS 3 3
WE and THEY SEE a poor camp a few shacks filthy skinny
people mill about barefoot kids shapeless women a general
air of extreme squalor

WE SEE A MULE tethered to a bush

On a long clothesline many strips of meat smoke over several
low fires

A tall gaunt man sits on a stump sharpening a long knife
This is RONNIE MILLER
EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI MILLER CAMP DAY CONTINUOUS 4
SETH and SHAY ride into the MILLER CAMP and the kids wild
as quail huddle around their mothers all of whom look to be
only skin and bones
But the tall gaunt RONNIE MILLER expresses no surprise

SETH CECIL

(looks around)
Mornin’ Ronnie

RONNIE MILLER
laconic--doesn’t look up)
Nothing dulls a knife quicker than

cutting up a tough mule

SETH CECIL
(cool--glances at the
clothesline)
I suspect that was our mule Henry
Clay that youve been whittling
onhe was elderly I admit but
no tougher I‘d say than your
average quadruped

RONNIE MILLER turns looks at the clothesline Looks back at
SETH

RONNIE MILLER
That wasnt your mule Seth

SETH CECIL
Yes that’s our mule Ronnie or
whats left of him

RONNIE MILLER
I said it wasn’t your mule That
old boy keeled over late yesterday
out of the blue

SETH CECIL
(sigh)

I suppose the point is moot but
that is our Little Nicky tethered
to that bush If he hadn‘t kicked
the pen down last night we

- wouldn’t be interrupting your meal

Suddenly WE HEAR a shriek

WE SEE HACKSAW MILLER RONNIE’S younger brother over by the
tethered mule Holds his bloody hand

HACKSAW MILLER
Dern he’s near bit my hand off

SETH rides over to Little Nickydismounts Takes his rifle
from the sheath holds it like a club WE SEE SETH has a
pronounced limp a stiff left leg and yet he moves steadily
and rather smoothly Little Nicky curls his lip but doesnt
bite as SETH approaches

SETH CECIL
(untying the mule
It’s unwise to approach Little
Nicky unless youre carrying a
stout club

HACKSAW sucks at his bitten hand

HACKSAW MILLER
(bitter)
I told you we should have
slaughtered ‘em both

SETH CECIL
Hacksaws right it ain’t wise to
keep stolen mules around

RONNIE MILLER sees that his lie is pointless

RONNIE MILLER
We did mean to eat both mules
Sethas you can see weve got
hungry mouths to feed

SETH CECIL
Though I despise a biting mule I
need to take Little Nicky home
There’s been none too many vittles
at our house either since the
War

SETH mounts They ride off watched by the MILLER brothers
and the silent women and children

5 EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI MISSOURI RIVER RIVER TRAIL 5
AFTERNOON LATER

Clouds float above the broad brown Missouri River WE SEB a
flatboat in the distance SETH and SHAY ride along the
shore below a bluff where WE CAN SEE a cabin with smoke
coming out of the chimney The mule LITTLE NICKY follows
behind SHAY who holds a lead rope

In the other direction perhaps a half mile a few buildings
along the riverbank this is the hamlet of BOONES LICK

SETH CECIL
I despise cloudy weather
(glances up at the cabin)
Women get cranky when it’s cloudy

SHAY CECIL
Ma don’t need clouds to be cranky

SETH CECIL
Your ma’s particular Shay I
admit and lack of healthful
sunshine don’t help It‘s best to
walk small around Mary Margaret
Just walk a little smaller on
cloudy days

Just then WE HEAR a rifle shot from the bluff above them

SETH looks startledmaneuvers his horse up the narrow
trail as SHAY follows

EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI RIVER TRAIL AFTERNOON 6
CONTINUOUS

on the bluff WE SEE a slim girl--this is NEVA SHAY‘S
sister just a year older than SHAY—-race down the trail
toward them she is barefoot fairly flies

Doesn’t slow until she reaches SETH and SHAY who rein up
dismount

EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI RIVER AFTERNOON CONTINUOUS 7

SETH CECIL
Easy honey easy--

NEVA is so out of breath she gulps air not able to speak

SHAY CECIL
She’s outrun her own voice

SETH CECIL
(pats her on the back)
What is it Neva Nobody shot your
Ma did they

NEVA CECIL
It was Ma that shot She killed a
horse

SETH CECIL
(obviously relieved)
The world can spare a horse but
none of us can spare your mother

NEVA CECIL
It was the Sheriffs horse Ma shot

SETH CECIL
She shot Baldy Stone’s horse Now
that’s irregular Where was Baldy —
at the time

NEVA CECIL
Sitting on it

EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI RIVER AFTERNOON CONTINUOUS 8

NEVA having caught her breath starts toward the not-very
distant town of BOONE’S LICK which WE CAN GLIMPSE down the
riverbank ’

SHAY CECIL
Where you going

NEVA CECIL
(without apology)
To see Bill Hickok-

SETH CECIL
I admire your steady thinking
honey Bill could be a big help if
he was in the mood to be but this

cloudy weather might have put him

off

NEVA CECIL
You’re the only one who minds
clouds

NEVA trots on down the path

SETH CECIL
There‘s no shortage of hardheaded
females in the Cecil family If
you hit one of them in the head
vith a rock it would break the
rock

SHAY CECIL
Neva‘s sweet on Mr Hickok She
means to marry him

SETH CECIL
(laughs )
I doubt there’s enough mules in
Missouri to drag Bill Hickok to an
altar if he was the groom

SETH and SHAY mount start up the path NEVA has just headed
down

EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI cEcrr HAULING YARD AFTERNOON 9

The CECIL enterprise consists of a few empty rail pens a
shed and a sizeable cabin Off to one side ig SETH’s
outdoor camp SETH sleeps outside the main cabin in this
little setup

As SETH and SHAY arrive WE SEE a short round bald man
sitting glumly on the rump of a large dead horse fans
himself with his hat This is SHERIFF BALDY STONE

SHERIFF BALDY STONE
(fans himself whis hat)
Well Sethshe shot my horse and
here I sit And to think I once
courted Mary Margaret before she
Married your brother Dick

- SETH CECIL
I suspect she still has a sweet
spot for you Baldy

SHERIFF BALDY STONE
A sweet spot I don’t think so

SETH CECIL
It would explain why she shot the
horse and not you

SHAY laughs as his mother MARY MARGARET CECIL steps out the
door of the cabin with her youngest child BABY MARCY
(around a year old) in her arms

MARY MARGARET is in her late thirties direct a little
xawboned but very appealing she is lively and on occasion
flirtatious while remaining quite formidable

BALDY stands up

MARY MARGARET immediately walks over to SETH and casually
hands him BABY MARCY who coos in delight

SETH CECIL
Now Mary Margaret you oughtn‘t to
have burdened me with this infant
Baldy’s out of sorts and there
might be gunplay

SHERIFF BALDY STONE
(shakes his head)
No sir no gun lay There’s been
violence enough for one day

MARY MARGARET walks over and looks at the dead horse
thoughtfully Touches its rump

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(faraway look in her eye)
Why it is a horse What a
surprise

SHERIFF BALDY STONE
Of course it’s a horse thoroughly
dead You shot it out from under
me before I could tell you why I’m
here

SHAY CECIL
(puzzled)
Ma anybody can see its a horse
What did you think it was

MARY MARGARET CECIL
An elk I thought no more mush
were going to be eating elk

SHAY looks distressed whats wrong with his mother

MARY MARGARET CECIL

(still with the faraway

look)
Maybe I was too hungry to see
straight I just saw all that
meat

(pause-—her voice takes on

a flirtatious tone)
Weve got buttermilk to spare
Eddie if you’d like some Since I
shot your horse it’s the least I
ean offer

It works BALDY charmed follows MARY MARGARET into the
house SETH carrying BABY MARCY and SHAY follow too

INT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURT CECIL CABIN AFTERNOON 10
CONTINUOUS

A plain but roomy cabin with a sleeping loft A big
fireplace is filled with cooking pots A simple table and
chairs A crock of buttermilk sits on the table

GRANDPA HUBERT CRACKENTHORPE an old skinny perpetuall
complaining nag watches resentfully as MARY MARGARET ladies
the Sheriff a dipperful of buttermilk

GRANDPA CRACKENTHORPE
I‘m the oldest if anyone gets
buttermilk it ought to be me

MARY MARGARET CECIL

Wait your turn Daddy
(to Baldy)

I‘m hungry and my family’s hungry
When you rode up all I could see
was steaksbig sizzling elk
steaks

(MORE)

MARY MARGARET CECIL (contd)
(pause)
Shay’s a good worker Eddie Maybe
he can help you out at the jail
somehow to make up for your loss

SHERIFF BALDY STONE
Maybe The reason I come up here
in the first place was to try and
recruit Seth and the boy for a
little posse work

SETH CECIL
If theres cash money involved
consider us recruited -

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Wait a minute Seth Don’t be
pledging my son for a posse until
we know the reason

SHERIFF BALDY STONE
Jake Miller and his gang‘s the
reason Ronnie Miller and Hacksaw
are tolerable but Jake and his
bunch are ravin’ killers and
thieves The War’s been over
Nearly a year and a half but Jake
and his crew are robbing and
murdering worse than ever I need
to get up a posse and finish them

(pause)

A id posse

SETH CECIL

My nephew and I just visited the
Millers Jake and his ugly bunch
wasn’t home else I‘d have killed
him then and there and saved the
county the expense

(pause
We might hire on if the money‘s
right

MARY MARGARET looks doubtful

SETH CECIL
Mary you just admitted you’re so
hungry you mistook a horse for an
elk Were being offered cash
money to help Baldy round up a few
common hooligans

SETH tries to hand MARY MARGARET the baby but she thwarts
the move--picks up a huge knife sharpens it on a large
whirring whetstone

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(tense)
Shoo I can’t be holding the baby
while I’m sharpening knives We
need to butcher that horse

SETH and MARY glare at one another which unnerves both
GRANDPA and BALDY STONE A tense silence follows too tense
for GRANDPA who seizes a huge pistol and makes for the door

GRANDPA CRACKENTHORPE
There‘s a panther lurking
aronndT mean to get it before it
gets me

He leaves
BALDY follows GRANDPA stops at the door

SHERIFF BALDY STONE
Thanks for the buttermilk Mary

She hardly notices The whir of the grindstone fills the
room BALDY goes

SHAY looks at SETH who nods that SHAY should follow the
SHERIFF out the door SHAY obeys

SETH CECIL

That knife’s sharp enough to slice
a brick Would you just stop for a
minute

She stops They lock eyes

SETH CECIL
Shays nearly aman Mary He
needs to get a little experience
out in the world And were nearly
flat broke

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I dont know that I trust Baldy
Stone and a posse with my one and
only boy

SETH CECIL
Not Baldy Stone Maryme It’s
me youd be trusting him with
Den‘t you think Shay needs to grow
up a little

MARY MARGARET considers silent

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(finally)
Go find out how much cash money’s
involved

EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI CECIL HAULING YARD AFTERNOON 11
CONTINUOUS

SETH with BABY MARCY walks over to SETH’S little camp where
SHAY and BALDY wait SETH puts MARCY on a saddle which sits
on the ground

SHERIFF BALDY STONE
Didn’t you get enough of sleeping
outside with the military Seth

SETH CECIL
I cannot tolerate the confinements
of a roof Fetid air is sure to
accumulate under a roof Whats
the pay for this posse work youre
planning

SKERIFF BALDY STONE
Twenty-five dollars for you and
maybe ten for young Shay Id be
tempted to offer Bill Hickok fifty
if he’d come

SETH CECIL
(stiffens)

Are you saying it’s twenty-five
dollars to me and fifty to Bill
Hickok even though in the War I
was the sharpshooter and Bill just
a common spy I cannot accept such
shabby terms

SHERIFF BALDY STONE
I might even up the pay if youd
recruit Hickok for meseeing as
you’re old friends

SHAY CECIL
What about me Uncle Seth

SETH CECIL
I’m working on it Shay Im
working on it So it’s fifty
apiece for me and Billy and ten
for this gangly youth Is that
firm Baldy
il

That’s a hundred and ten dollars
Seth We could build a new jail
for less than that

SETH CECIL
You could but it wouldnt have the
t

Millers in it

SHERIFF BALDY STONE
All right then When will you ask
Hickok

SETH CECIL
After Supper I suppose once we ‘ve
butchered your horse

MARY MARGARET appears at the door sharpened knife in hand
just in time to hear SETHS remark about the dead horse

MARY MARGARET CECIL

(firm)
I thought it was an elk

(looks around)
Where’s Neva TI gent her to fetch
the two of you and now she ain’t
here when I need her

BALDY senses a confrontation grabs his saddie and skedaddles
towards BOONE’S LICK

Looks exchanged between SETH and SHAY

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Shay where is she

SETH CECIL
She trotted on into Boones Lick
She’s probably ietpping rope with
one of her little riendsor else
rolling a hoop around the streets

MARY MARGARET CECIL

(snapping her fingers)
Go get her Shay

(to Seth)
You may not have noticed since
youre not one to notice much but
Neva‘s left the tope-skipping stage
behind

GRANDPA wanders back still carries his pistol

SETH CECIL
I’1l straggle along and chaperone
if it’1l ease your mind MaryI
need to see Billy Hickok anyway

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(frowns
Bill Hickok Then that explains
where my lovesick daughter is

Her tone of voice causes GRANDPA CRACKENTHORPE to turn right
around and go back where he just came from

GRANDPA CRACKENTHORPE
Evening’s the best time for hunting
panthers

Hurries off

SETH CECIL
If she should happen to be with
Bill Hickok then she’s as safe as
if she was in jail Billisa
perfect gentleman where young
ladies are concerned

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Shay didnt I tell you to go
to Seth)
And don‘t you stay gone all night
either Seth

SETH rolls his eyes at this despotism but says nothing

SETH and SHAY leave

12 EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI BOONE’S LICK EVENING 12
SETH and SHAY stroll along the trail just outside of BOONE’S
LICK
SHAY CECIL
That was a horse It wasnt an
elk
SETH CECIL

It did seem to have the appearance
of a horse

SHAY CECIL
Besides a sheriff wouldnt ride an

elk

SETH CECIL
It would be unlikely yes Females
make their own kind of sense Shay
as you’ll one day discover

Suddenly NEVA trots up the road from town

SHAY CECIL
Neva where you been You got me
in trouble with Ma

NEVA CECIL
(doesn’t pause) -
None of your business you oaf

as she disappears up the trail

SETH CECIL
Besides being hardheaded the women
in this family are closemouthed
The only way to figure out what
they’re up to is to catch ‘em at

it
13 INT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI BOONE’S LICK RUSTY NAIL SALOONS
NIGHT
SETH and SHAY push through the doors and enter a hard-bitten

Missouri River saloon filled with wharf rats and pugnacious
boatmen some of whom have already passed out under the
tables Snore like saws

Alone at the back table facing the door elegant in a
fringed buckskin jacket sits WILD BILL HICKOK idly shuffles
a deck of cards Lays out a game of solitaire

Ignoring the general debris SETH and SHAY walk back to
HICKOK’S table

WILD BILL HICKOK
(stands
Why hello Seth Who’s your
sturdy sidekick

SETH CECIL
This is my nephew Sherman To save
time we call him Shay

WILD BILL HICKOK
(gestures)
Take a seat You just missed your
fetching niece Miss Geneva
(MORE)

WILD BILL HICKOK (contd)
She looked hungry so I fed her a
beefsteak and she ate it so quick
I fed her another That young lady
can eat

A none-too-friendly bartender appears sets two glasses on
the table

SETH CECIL
You can just leave the bottle sir
That way you won‘t have to traipse
back and forth across the floor
stirring the dust

The floor is filthy with cigar butts and a good pile of mud
just inside the door where some of the muleskinners have
scraped off their boots

BARTENDER
Theres not a speck of dust on this
floor What do you think I do all
day and all night Sweep this
floor that’s what I do

SETH CECIL
Just leave the bottle There’s no
need for a dispute

BARTENDER
(sets down the bottle
then to Hickok)
What does he think I do all day and
all night

Walks off

SETH CECIL
(pours two drinks)
That fellow is overworked A dead
skunk would not be noticed on this
floor

Slides the second drink to HICKOK

WILD BILL HICKOK
to Shay
Don’t you drink young man

SHAY CECIL
(looks at Uncle Seth)
I wouldif I was allowed

SETH CECIL
He’s not drinking on my watch His
Mas in a scalping mood as it is
(MORE)

SETH CECIL (contd)
Besides he’s got to ride with me
and Sheriff Stone on a posse in the
morning A hangover would not be
welcome

(drinks)

The Sheriff was hoping I could coax
you into joining us

WILD BILL HICKOK
Who’s the target

SETH CECIL
Jake Miller’s gang of murderous
riffraff

WILD BILL HICKOK
Im interested That damn Little
Billy Perkins runs with them and
he has done me several bad turns

SETH CECIL
Little Billy has few morals-—few to
none It would be doing a favor to
humanity to dispose of Little
Billy

WILD BILL HICKOK
I’m in the mood to do the
favorif the pay is decent

SETH CECIL
Fifty dollars apiece for you and
me and a pittance for young
Sherman here

WILD BILL HICKOK
(whistles)
Fifty times two makes a hundred if
my arithmetic is sound

WILD BILL relaxed and in a good mood surveys the saloon
The men in the front of the saloon don’t seem relaxed at all
Several glare in the direction of SETH and WILD BILL who

ignore them

WILD BILL HICKOK
It’s time I scared up a card game
I‘ll contribute my services if the
town’s got the money Im
available anytime but Priday

SETH CECIL
Whats wrong with Friday

WILD BILL HICKOK
(shuffling cards)
I don’t work Fridays

gunfighters have their
superstitions

SETH CECIL

saloon Someone sits on the landing smoking a thin cigar

SETH looks uneasy

SETH CECIL
(to Shay)

r She starts to hand it up to SHAY
SETH CECIL

No sidearms for Shay Sidearms are
only reliable in the hands of
experts and sometimes not then

WILD BILL HICKOK
Shooting a pistol is just a matter
of pointing straight But the fact
is very few people can point
straight -

MARY MARGARET CECIL
If anything happens to my boy I‘11
show all three of you somebody who
can point straight

WILD BILL HICKOK

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I didn‘t mean right this minute
Finish squeezing the clothes
Besides your Auntie is not exactly
an early riser

NEVA CECIL
What an oaf

SHAY glares at her

NEVA CECIL
A better question is why Pa don’t
hardly come to see us Grandpa
Hubert says you were mean to Pa
He says you run him off which is
why we don’t hardly get to see him

SHAY CECIL
Grandpas cracked Neva you know
that

MARY MARGARET CECIL

You’re even mean to Uncle Seth I
dont know why he ain’t left too

MARY MARGARET stops scrubbing faces her daughter

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Seems like you think Im mean to
everybody

NEVA CECIL
You ain’t mean to Shay He’s your
pet

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Maybe thats because Shay’s
dependable You go sneaking off
when I need you just so you can
flirt with a slick ladies’ man like
Bill Hickok

NEVA whirls on her mother nostrils flaring

NEVA CECIL
Hes a perfect gentleman

She stalks off

SHAY CECIL

Do you think I’m mean to your Uncle
Seth

SHAY considers

SHAY CECIL

SETH CECIL
Hard to say One reason Dicks a

way to look for you anyway
There’s a bunch of bushwhacking
Jayhawkers on their way to arrest
me over that McCandless business
that happened during the War

WILD BILL HICKOK (contd)
Leaving before they arrive would
appear to be the sensible thing

MARY MARGARET CECIL
You can come if you’re ready to
leave I aint waiting

waterfront

EXT NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI BOONE’S LICK DAY CONTINUOUS 55

At the riverfront Down the channel a ways WE SEE a still-
smoking hulk of a steamboat

WE ALSO SEE an INDIAN with a canoe idly untangles a fishing
line No other vessels on the river He wears buckskin
leggings and a thin shirt An old hat sits atop his head

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Neva go ask that Indian gentleman
if he’s seen our boat

SETH CECIL
How could he see something we can’t
see

NEVA dismounts and hurries down to the riverbank Speaks
with the INDIAN They both come walking back to the wagon

WILD BILL HICKOK
Why I know that Indian He’s from
upin Wyoming and a mighty useful
fellow He led me across some thin
ice once during the War
Otherwise the Rebs would have hung
me for sure

NEVA and the INDIAN arrive

WILD BILL HICKOK

Hello Charlie Folks this is
Charlie Seven Days of the Lehmi

Shoshoni
MARY MARGARET CECIL
(direct)
Mr Seven Days have you seen any

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
(polite rather formal)
I was explaining to the young lady
that the boat she was expecting
burned up last night

He turns and points

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Damn the luck

SETH CECIL
Watch your language I guess that
means well have to go home and
unpack

MARY MARGARET ignores him

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
There is a steamboat tied up at
Glasgow which isn’t far

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Sir if youre going our way maybe
you’d be kind enough to guide us

SETH CECIL
Now Mary that’s unnecessary I
can find Glasgow easy enough

- MARY MARGARET CECIL
I wasnt talking about Glasgow
Mr Hickok says this gentlemans
from wyoming and Wyoming‘s where
my husband is supposed to be I
was hoping he’d guide us to where
Dick is

SETH CECIL
What do you think I am if not a
guide

MARY MARGARET CECIL
My brother-in-law

SETH CECIL
But we just met this fellow he may
have plans of his own

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
I am traveling to South Pass I
could guide you that far But L

might need it up the river
Sometimes the big boats get stuck

NEVA sees an opportunity for an adventure

no better man for the job than
Charlie

SETH CECIL
(disgusted)
Why not just ask the President

riding up the Missouri River with a
passel of lunatics

SETH hands MARCY to ROSIE Gets down from the wagon seat
fakes his horse from SHAY

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Where do you think youre going

SETH CECIL
If I ain’t trusted to drive the
team there‘s no reason for me to
bounce along in such a rude
conveyance I might as well lope
along with Billy and hire that
boat if there is a boat

WILD BILL HICKOK
(cordial)
You’1 make it by sundown if you
don’t stop to picnic

SETH and BILL ride off

GRANDPA CRACKENTHORPE

MARY MARGARET CECIL (contd)

I needed to make a change so we’re
going to Wyoming One thing

permanent is that I love you

Besides it’s time you saw a bit of
the world Wyoming might be a fine
place

ROSIE MCGEE
You‘ve outgrown Boone’s Lick
anyway Sherman If you get much
more polished Ive no doubt some
forward young lady will be trying
to marry you

SHAY beet red smiles

SHAY CECIL
(surprised)
Why he heard you There he goes

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
My people believe it was a great
turtle who brought human beings out
of the earth into the land of grass
and sky

SHAY CECIL
Our preacher says the Lord made the

world in six days and then rested
on the seventh

CHARLIE considers this information

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS

sense

ella

MARY MARGARET CECIL
For all your skittering around

make a good ma I got nothing
against Mr Hickok but I don’t
really see him as the fatherly

ROSIE MCGEE

But Sis I didn’t really know till
I was gone how hard it was gonna
be Its been all I could do these
past few years just getting from

MARY MARGARET CECIL

about that

(MORE )

MARY MARGARET CECIL (contd)

fifty feet It’s different on

Places

CHARLIE points at a patch of water just upstream

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
See that ripple

SHAY CECIL
I see it

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
That‘s made by a tree branch
There’s a dead tree in the channel

WE SEE in the distance some herons feeding on a sandbar

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
Those heron are in the middle of
the river but their feet are
barely wet That means a sandbar
If we go that way we will be
stuck

SETH stands at the rail a somber look on his face
Nearby NEVA and JOEL the young boatman fish

raining

SETH CECIL
Pshaw Rain don’t matter toa
fish It’s always wet where the
fish live

JOEL
(indignant)
Go to hell this ain’t your boat

SETH walks away Joins MARY MARGARET

SETH CECIL
(nods at Joel)
That hoot owl has few manners
Neva better watcn him

MARY MARGARET CECIL
A man your age whos never been
married should refrain from
mouthing off about things he don’t
understand

SETH CECIL
(annoyed)
And what don‘t I understand

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Women for one thing And women
for another Besides being surly
is no way to start a trip

SETH CECIL
I get surly when Im worried and
right now I’m plenty worried

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Don‘t worry about Joel and Neva
Im keeping my eye on them

SETH CECIL
Its not that It’s Rat Town

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Why would they call a place Rat
Town

SETH CECIL
Because there used to be plentiful
muskrats along that stretch of the
river The Osage did a brisk
business in muskrat pelts for a
while That’s all over with Now
it’s a haven for renegade Rebs who
won’t stop fightin’ the War
Horsethieves mostly

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Can’t we stay out in the middle of
the river Or else slip by at
night

SETH CECIL
Even Charlie might not be able to
find the channel at night And the
boatmen wont like it

MARY MARGARET CECIL

(softens)
Seth
He looks at her

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I‘m sorry I picked on you for being
surly

ROSIE MCGEE

SETH wanders over

MARY MARGARET CECIL
What kind of town is Council
Bluffs

SETH CECIL
Hilly

MARY MARGARET CECIL
That ain’t what I meant You do
irritate me sometimes

ROSIE MCGER
She means is there a bad sheriff
whos likely to beat me up

SETH CECIL
I don’t keep up with Towa
constabularies

A commotion breaks out

JOEL
No I can’t live without you

JOEL the fiery boatman has gone wild he begins to butt
his head against the aide of the boiler

NEVA CECIL
Joel says he’ll kill himself if r
won’t be his girl

SETH CECIL
Here now son youll crack our
‘boiler
® SETH and BILL pull him away but the moment they turn him

loove he races right off the boat into the Missouri River

JOEL
(yelling as he runs)
Then I’11 drown myself

NEVA CECIL
Ma he‘s drowning himself and he
was just getting to be my friend

SETH CECIL
Calm down honey I doubt he’s got
the determination to drown himself
in water this shallow

JOEL
(from out in the water
somewhere )
Twill I wili rm nearly drowned
already

NEVA CECIL
(at the edge of the boat)
You are not Youre standing on a
sandbar Come back here

WILD BILL HICKOK

“SETH CECIL
(taken by surprise)
Wellnow Ii

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(interrupts him)
What’d I tell you Rose He hasn’t
got a love fit in him

SEYH looks startled he is aware that he has been judged to
be wanting somehow but doesn’t know what to do about it

SETH CECIL
(mutters)
How would you know what kind of
fits Im 1 kely to have

MARY MARGARET just looks at him

EXT MISSOURI RIVER BOAT DAY 86
It is a beautiful day on the river EVERYONE is on deck
Ahead not far is the thriving community of Omaha Nebraska

Amongst the beauty however they spot another burned-out
hulk of a large flatboat

ALL STARE as they pass by

EXT MISSOURI RIVER OMAHA NEBRASKA BOAT DAY LATER 87

The boat is heading for the bustling docks of Omaha many
vessels of all sizes

SETH paying little attention to the bustle meticulously
cleans his rifle MARY MARGARET watches with annoyance his
blithe way of ignoring an important landing

MARY MARGARET CECIL
All right Seth You know where
Dick is or if you don’t know
exactly you can get us in the
neighborhood Wyomings west of
Omaha ain‘’t it

SETH CECIL
Well yesgenerally speaking
Wyoming’s westerly from here

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I wasn’t speaking generally I was
asking if Omaha is the place to get
off and start looking for my
husband

When they hear the tone in her voice EVERYONE moves back

from the two of them

MARY MARGARET CECIL
You better not play me false Seth

SETH CECIL
And what’s that supposed to mean

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I don’t know what it means I just
get the feeling that you don’t
really want me to find Dick and I
need to know where he is Ive
already lost my own father because
of this Just don’t you play me
alse

SETH slips his rifle back in its sheath Looks her in the

eye

CECIL

Maryyou surely don’t think I’d
endanger you and the children by
leading you on some kind of wild
goose chase do you Let’s get
this wagon off the boat Shay get
the horses and mules

(tries to appear casual)
Its a fine time of year to be
traveling on the Platte Tf we
travel steady I believe we can make
the new forts before Christmas

EXT OMAHA NEBRASKA DOCKS DAY MINUTES LATER

Minutes later they have unloaded the CECIL wagon and

livestock

MARY MARGARET SHAY and NEVA are all around ROSIE
CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS ignores the scene
SETH and WILD BILL look embarrassed

ROSIE MCGEE
I should have come home sooner
Mary

MARY MARGARET CECIL
No sense fretting about it now
Rose we all had our struggles
during that War tT can’t blame you
anymore for leaving We knew you
was always too lively for Boone’s
Lick

ROSIE MCGEE
Yesbut so were you

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Maybe so sistermaybe so But
once I started spilling out babies
I couldnt seem to stop

The sisters both laugh softly

ROSIE

The only thing I knew back then was
I didn‘t want to be in a little
backwoods town all my life

(looks fondly at her

niece)
-you might be another Cecil gal
whos too lively for country life
honey

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(wiping tears)
I wish you would Shange your mind
and go with us Youd be welcome
too Mr Hickok

WILD BILL HICKOK
Thanks but I doubt wed flourish
Too far between cardgames

SETH CECIL
(formal)
Good luck in Towa Bill 1
understand it’s tame Maybe youll
get that Little Billy Perkins yet

WILD BILL HICKOK
I hope so The gall of the man is
hard to tolerate

ROSIE hugs NEVA then SHAY
MARY MARGARET and ROSIE hug the longest

At the last moment NEVA suddenly has a little fit She
walks directly up to HICKOK stands facing him fighting back
tears

NEVA CECIL
(insistent)
I don’t want you to leave I want
to go with you and Auntie

WILD BILL startled and uncomfortable with this display of
female emotion looks around for help

WILD BILL HICKOK
Now Miss GenevaI appreciate the
sentimentbut I doubt your folks
can spare you
ROSIE puts her arm around her niece
ROSIE MCGEE
Bills right honey Maybe you and
me and Billy will meet up down the
roadwhen youre a little older
(pause)
Besides your Ma‘s gonna need you
And your Pas gonna want to see
what a fine girl he haa
NEVA begins to cry

JOEL comes up and stands beside her

EXT OMAHA NEBRASKA DOCKS DAY CONTINUOUS 89
Finally the boat pulls away

WILD BILL and ROSIE stand in the rear wave

MARY MARGARET SHAY NEVA and SETH all watch and wave

NEVA and MARY MARGARET cry

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS watches too

SHAY CECIL
Omaha’s a big town

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
Yes I’m going to sell my canoe
and buy a horse

INT OMAHA NEBRASKA GENERAL STORE DAY 90
The CECILS buy supplies
SETH and SHAY test hatchets
MARY MARGARET and a still-mopey NEVA try on bonnets
MARY MARGARET CECIL
I hear the sun’s bright out west

We may need bonnets

Wandering around SETH comes upon a case containing ladies
gloves and a fine lace shaw ’

Sneaks a look over at MARY MARGARET

Indicates to the saleswoman he wants to see the shawl
She hands it to him

He takes it and drapes it over MARY MARGARETS shoulders

MARY MARGARET CECIL
What are you doing Seth
(she looks down at
herself)
Lace You want to buy me lace when
were going into the wilderness aA

suit of armor would be more useful
NEVA CECIL
Ma it’s so pretty on you
SETH CECIL
There’1l be balls and such at the
forts
(pause)

Remember Mary how you used to
shine at balla

MARY MARGARET remembers softening to him after he says it

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(looks in a mirror)
I was just a girl then Seth It’s
been such a while since I wae a
girl

SETH CECIL

It don’t mean you can’t still
shine

(to the saleswoman)
Well take this ma’am

The SALESWOMAN smiles takes it away to wrap it

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(not very convincing)
You shouldn‘t be wasting your money
on fripperies like that

But she can’t suppress a flush of pleasure

91 EXT OMAHA NEBRASKA BLACKSMITH’S SHOP DAY 91
MARY MARGARET is at the blacksmith’s shop

The BLACKSMITH--an independent Yankee who refuses to be
hurried-is hard at work on the CECIL wagon but ia not
working fast enough to suit MARY MARGARET

MARY MARGARET CECIL
What‘s the delay sir We need to
r) be on the move

BLACKSMITH
I‘ll fix what I can fix as fast as
I can fix it

A tall irascible-looking officer rides up his horse
limping this is COLONEL FETTERMAN He dismounts Slaps
his quirt against his leg the picture of impatience
Doesn’t see MARY MARGARET in the shadow behind the wagon

COLONEL FETTERMAN
Shoe my horse sir immediately
Ive a patrol to ride

BLACKSMITH
(nails in his mouth)
Just let me finish this little bit
of work on the ladys wagon
Colonel

COLONEL FETTERMAN
Damn the wagon and damn the lady
I cannot pursue wild savages on a
lame horse Youre to shoe my
horse now

The BLACKSMITH tries to signal the COLONEL that MARY MARGARET
is right there but it’s too late

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(steps into view)
You can damn me till youre hoarse
Colonel but I was here first and I
insist on prompt service

COLONEL FETTERMAN
(his face dark)
You‘ve no business interfering with
the needs of the army whoever you
are

The BLACKSMITH has gone on with his efforts to fit a rim on
the CECIL wagon wheel

COLONEL FETTERMAN
Damn you man if you won’t take
orders Ill have’ you jailed

SETH come wandering up

SETH CECIL

Say Colonel Fetterman

(winks at Mary)
--I’m anxious to know your opinion
of Sioux horsemanship There‘s
some military men out here in the
windies who claim they’re the best
light cavalry in the world Is
that your opinion

COLONEL FETTERMAN

Whoever said that is a goddamn

fool A bunch of naked savages on
- horseback don’t amount to a

cavalry

(snorts)

I could take eighty men and whip

the whole Sioux Nation And I hope

I get the chance

MARY MARGARET CECIL
And I hope you don’t sir

COLONEL FETTERMANS face turns nearly purple

SETH CECIL
Mary

COLONEL FETTERMAN
You goddamn settlers are a bigger
nuisance to the United States Army
than the Sioux or all the rest of
the tribes put together

(MORE)

COLONEL FETTERMAN (cont‘d)
If I had my way Id stop ever dam
one of you at the Mississippi River
and send you back to Kentucky or
wherever you came from

MARY MARGARET walks right up to him she looks like she
might slap him but she merely stares him down

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(to the blacksmith)
Keep after that wheel blacksmith
She walks away grabbing SETH by the arm as she goes

FETTERMAN just stands there black with rage

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN DAY 92

SETH MARY MARGARET NEVA and SHAY are just pulling out of
town MARY MARGARET still drives the wagon

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS is catching up with them
He rides a small horse His feet almost touch the ground

SETH is amused by the sight of CHARLIE’S feet nearly dragging
the ground on the little sorrel

SETH CECIL
(on his own horse)
My God Charlie that horse aint
big enough to fart

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Seth watch your language

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN DAY 93

Frosty weather WE SEE a vast vast distance ahead the
Great Plains

MARY MARGARET cleans up from breakfast NEVA helps
SETH is rooting around in the wagon

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I havent seen a tree in a week I
never expected to be in a place
where I wouldnt see a tree in a
week

NEVA CECIL
It’s spooking me Ma

SETH CECIL
There are trees farther west
Plenty of them

SHAY CECIL
How much farther west

SETH CECIL
Fort Laramie Theres forests
aplenty from then on

MARY MARGARET CECIL
You think Dick will be there

SETH CECIL
Dicks restless as a flea If he
ain’t there somebody will be able
to tell us where he is

SETH pulls out a few sacks he bought in OMAHA Gives one to
SHAY and one to NEVA

SHAY CECIL

What ‘re we supposed to do with
these
i SETH CECIL

Gather turds

NEVA CECIL

look warm MARCY sleeps

The chips the children have gathered burn brightly

SETH CECIL
(looking up at the night

The stars are brighter in Nebraska
Some of those stars look big as
rocks

SHAY CECIL
I never thought I’d be burning
turds to stay warm

SETH CECIL

WE HEAR dogs howling in the distance

The horses prick their ears

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
(picks up a rifle)
Horses and dogs

MARY MARGARET CECIL
What is it

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS

Pawnee

SETH CECIL
I wondered when theyd be paying us
a visit

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(indignant)
Cant they see it’s bedtime I
just got this baby to sleep

The mules are greatly upset They are snorting and straining
at their ropes CHARLIE gets up to calm them down

SETH CECIL
Indians don’t worry much about the
time Time is all of a piece to
them They don’t clock it like we
do ¢

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Youd think anybody could see it’s
bedtime

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
We need to guard our goods

SETH CECIL
Pawnee ain’t hostile but a quick
Pawnee could steal the socks off a
preacher

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN NIGHT CONTINUOUS 95

Then about twelve mounted PAWNEES emerge from the night MEN
and WOMEN dogs a travois They come right into camp

The leader NOSE TURNS DOWN is a tall skinny man He wears
an old black hat and a string of yellow bear teeth around his
neck

The rest crowd around look in the wagon inspect everything
One comes up to SHAY and feels the buttons on his coat

Another takes a comb from NEVA‘S hair--examines it--gives it
back to her

NOSE TURNS DOWN
(In Pawnee he asks for the gift of
a mule)

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
The old one wants a mule

MARY MARGARET CECIL
He won’t get a mule but he‘ll get
2 Piece of my mind it he wakes this
ry

NOSE TURNS DOWN asks again

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
He still wants a mule

SETH CECIL
We can‘t spare a mule Give him
two plugs of tobacco and a ‘decent
hatchet
The leader chatters
CHARLIE responds

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
They want bullets

SETH CECIL
Then give them some coffee

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Who told you to start giving away
my coffee

SETH CECIL
Mary it‘s the custom Neva get
some coffee but go light on it
Your mother’s a regular Comanche
without her coffee

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN NIGHT A FEW MINUTES LATER 96
Tobacco hatchets coffee and some beads are handed over

The PAWNEES mount and begin to trot away into the night
Soon all that can be heard is the crunch of horse hooves on
the frozen night grass

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Now we can get some sleep

SETH CECIL
No you and Marcy can get some
sleep The rest of us have to
stand watch and a close watch
too

NEVA CECIL
But the Indians left

SHAY CECIL
You can hear them they‘re heading
for the river

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
It’s once the Pawnee leave that you
must be most watchful

CHARLIE heads for the mules

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN DEEP NIGHT 97

The six mules and two horses are hitched to the wagon ina
line

WE SEE SHAY NEVA and CHARLIE standing between two mules
WE HEAR coyotes in the distance

SHAY CECIL

NEVA gives him a black look

SHAY CECIL
I wish Id stayed in Missouri

NEVA CECIL
You’re safer here with us

SHAY CECIL
I wont be when the Indians come
and cut off my ears

NEVA CECIL
Why would they want your dirty old
ears

SHAY jabs her she slaps his arms
SETH anything but jolly comes over

SETH CECIL
(grave)
If you know what’s good for you
youll stop cutting up and pa’
attention We ain’t out of this

SHAY CECIL
Yes sir
98 EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN VERY EARLY MORNING 98

SHAY and NEVA thaw by the fire MARY MARGARET drinks coffee
rummages through some of their things in the wagon

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Why they stole my cowbell

SETH CECIL
(holding Marcy)
If all we lost was a cowbell we
got off light We don’t have a cow
anyway

Hands the baby to MARY

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I suppose the worst of the trip is
over then

SETH CECIL
(bends to pick up his

saddle
Now that‘s a wild statement
(MORE )

SETH CECIL (contd)
annoyed

The Pawnees didnt kill us but the
worst of the trip ain‘t even
started Mary We got to stay
vigilant

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Theres no need to yell I’m not
deaf

As he starts towards his horse with the saddle his stiff leg”
gives way

He falls heavily

SETH CECIL
Dern this chilly weather My leg
seizes up when it’s cold

MARY MARGARET CECIL
sets down her coffee)
Come on now
(she stoops down to help

him up)
We’‘ll walk it awake

SETH CECIL
(still annoyed)
No I can do it

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(relentless)
You cant do everything Seth
whether you like it or not

MARY goes to him He reluctantly puts his arm around her
shoulders They hobble around in the snow until he regains a
little control over his leg

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN DAY 99

WE SEE a little MONTAGE of their travels across the plains
as WE HEAR

WE SEE a tiny band of INDIANS searching the CECIL wagon and
touching MARY MARGARET’S hair turning and looking at NEVA’S
face

Then WE SEE the little band riding off

MARY MARGARET appears very annoyed

SETH CECIL
Why wouldnt they ride right in
There are no doors out here on the
baldies Mary Did you expect them
to knock

MARY MARGARET CECIL
No but I didnt expect them to be
so familiar either

SETH CECIL
(sharp)
‘It’s their country Were the
intruders not them

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(surprised at his tone)
I don’t want their country I just
want to pase through

SETH CECIL
We are passing through Us and a
lot more like us

WE SEE a few men walking carrying no more than a rifle a
spade and a blanket or two

WE SEE in a long shot a wagon train behind the CECIL party

WE SEE a few single wagons like the CECILS filled to
overflowing with goods and children

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN DAY 100

SETH MARY MARGARET CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS SHAY NEVA and BABY
MARCY are in rough country dips dry creeks rocks shallow
gullies and arroyos

As MARY MARGARET is urging the team across a little gully
suddenly the rear wagon wheel pops off and goes rolling down
the guliy
MARY MARGARET CECIL
Now where does that wheel think
it‘e going

The wagon drops so low that BABY MARCY slides out the back
right onto a small cactus She begins to wail

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS dismounts and grabs her up

His horse goes wandering down to graze at a tiny growth of
bunchgrass on the side of the gully

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Dern the luck Marey looks like a
pincushion
(yells)
Shay go fetch that wheel back

SHAY starts down the shallow arroyo behind CHARLIE’S little
sorrel

He is brought up short when what appears to be a large
boulder turns abruptly into a huge annoyed grizzly bear

The bear roarsswats the little horse as if it were a fly

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN DAY CONTINUOUS 101
SETH has his rifle in his hand quickly fires

The bear stopssits down

SETH rapidly reloads

Then the bear stands Roars even louder

SETH shoots

The bear stops paws at itself then falls dead

Everyone freezes even the baby forgets to cry-

A beat or two

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(impatient)

What‘s everybody lolling around
for My baby’s full of cactus
that wheel’s probably still
rolling and youre all standing
around looking at a dead bear
Shay go get that wheel

SETH CECIL
Wait a minute now It won’t do to
take chancoeo with a grizzly It
might still have some fight in it

MARY MARGARET CECIL
The bear’s dead I can see that
much from here

SETH approaches it cautiously
SBAY CECIL

(still in shock)
It kilt Charlie’s horse

SETH CECIL
It could have been worse It could
have laid waste to the mules

MARY MARGARET CECIL

Why make up notions about things

that didn’t happen You shot the

bear That’s one reason youre

along on this trip So you can

shoot things that need to be shot

to Neva)

Neva go get that wheel
NEVA ever fearless goes down and rolls the wheel back up
the gully

SETH CECIL
(annoyed)
I wish I was as practical as you
are Mary

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Well you ain’t And that’s that

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN MORNING 102
It is very cold
MARY MARGARET is patiently massaging SETH’S stiff leg

MARY MARGARET CECIL
How much farther to a house I’ve
about forgotten what a house looks
like

SETH CECIL
You could call Fort Laramie a
house of sorts Well be there in
a day or two But I doubt youll
approve of it either Life at
Fort Laramie is disorderly
There’s no shortage of cowards
drunkards and whores

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS who hae been afoot since his horse was
killed is looking off into the distance

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Don’t you talk of harlots around
the children

SETH puts up his hand to shush her which annoys MARY
MARGARET

SETH CECIL
Were about to have visitors

WE SEE tiny moving dots on the horizon

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
It’s the Bad Faces I see that
paint horse Red Cloud rides

SHAY CECIL
The Bad Faces
SETH CECIL
Yes Shay
(impressed)

That would be the Sioux

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN DAY CONTINUOUS 103

The SIOUX put on a brilliant display of horsemanship racing
at top speed and yelling as they come

NEVA CECIL
They’re charging

SETH though is relaxed

SETH CECIL
No honey they’re just showing
eff Look at ‘em fly Youre
looking at the finest light cavalry
in the world

WE SEE the SIOUX PARTY soaring over a gully like birds one
after the other their horses kicking up dust on the other
side

SETH CECIL
I’ve heard the Comanches can
outride the Sioux but I don’t trust
the report The Sioux ain’t been
cowed yet you see They still
think they have the right to run
their horses Look at them come

Then when they are no more than fifteen or twenty wagon
lengths from our little party they stop A few of the
horses are so caught up in the run that they paw the air
anxious to keep going

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN DAY CONTINUOUS 104

WE SEE a lone SIOUX on a paint horse bringing up the rear in
a Blow easy lope

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
Red Cloud is behind

NEVA CECIL
Who is Red Cloud

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
He’s their leader He’s even met
the President of the United States
(pause)
He likes to talk

SETH CECIL
So I’ve heard

RED CLOUD eases to the front of the crowd

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN DAY CONTINUOUS 105
Then RED CLOUD begins to talk

He has a narrow face and carries a repeater rifle He is in
full eagle feather and bear claw regalia very formal

He gives an oration in Sioux
ALL LISTEN
The oration continues

SHAY CECIL
(whispers to Seth)
I wish I could understand him

SETH CECIL
You’11 nearly have time to learn
the language before he shuts up
That old man could bore a rock

And continues

Eyes glaze over including those of the young warriors
whove heard more than enough from this old bore One or two
fall asleep on their horses ONE YOUNG WARRIOR falls so sound
asleep he slips off his horse onto the ground embarrassing
himself

And then it is over

The SIOUX WARRIORS come pouring into the CECIL CAMP crowding
around the wagon just as the Pawnees had

SETH gives them tobacco and plenty of coffee too “MARY
MARGARET doesnt say a word about it

SETH gives RED CLOUD a nice hunting knife

EXT NEBRASKA PLAIN DAY LATER
The SIOUX PARTY mounts

They leave

NEVA CECIL
Why do they call them Bad Faces

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I‘d like to know that too They
were the best looking Indians I’ve
seen
(pause)
Except for Charlie

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
It’s the name of Red Cloud’s band

SETH CECIL
(looking grim)
I hope Dick’s at Fort Laramie
That would be the lucky thing

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Well that cost us nearly half a
day What was that old man going
on about

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
He said the army should not have
built those three forts along the
Bozeman Trail He says there will
be a war unless the whites leave

SETH CECIL
Its foolishfoolish

SHAY CECIL
If it’s so foolish why are they
putting them up

SETH CECIL
Theres been a gold strike in
Montana which means miners will be
hurrying up the Bozeman Trail
Only it ain’t their trail Youve
heard of the Holy Land in the
Bible

NEVA CECIL
It’s where Cain slew Abel

108

SETH CECIL
That‘s right honey The army’s
built these new forts in the Sioux
Holy Land What Red Cloud said was
that the Sioux won’t stand for
itor the Cheyenne either

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
A white man with gold fever will
always try to go by the quickest
way even when the quickest way
means going through the Sioux

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(worried)
I suppose that’s where well find
Dick then Trust Dick Cecil to
find the most dangerous place in
the world and stay there

EXT WYOMING PLAIN DAY LONG SHOT 107

vast beautiful lonesome prairie the mountains towering
behind them

SETH is on his horse

FORT LARAMIE is in sight A stockade and gun towers in the
corners

There are a good many INDIANS camped outside the gates

Between the CECIL PARTY and the fort is a wide creek and
it’s in flood ‘

SETH CECIL
We could all sleep warm and dry in
Fort Laramie tonight if this creek
wasn’t up

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(sigh)
What now Seth

SETH CECIL
We do the thing you hate most
wait

MARY MARGARET CECIL
When will it go down Charlie

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
Tomorrow Unless it rains more

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(relentless)
I can’t wait that long ‘This is
not deep water

SETH CECIL
It ain‘t how deep it is it’s how
fast it’s flowing Mary

SHAY CECIL
Ma I see a washtuband a bucket

NEVA CECIL
(points)
There’s a rolling pin

WE SEE various household goods floating down a washtub
washboard rolling pin clothes pans a pitchfork

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Why this creeks a regular store

SETH is about at the end of his patience rope with her

SETH CECIL
The reason for the store is that
some fool with a wagon tried to
cross and now everything they own
is floating downstreamlike our
stuff will be if you don’t cease
and desist

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I can’t say that I care for your
tone today Seth

She immediately pops the mules and puts the wagon in the
water

SETH CECIL
Let’s go theres no stopping her

SHAY CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS and SETH follow
MARY MARGARET struggles up the far bank

They struggle through the waters getting soaking wet but

ALL eventually make it safely ashore

He doesn’t answer

EXT WYOMING PLAIN OUTSIDE FORT LARAMIE DAY

The CECIL PARTY approaches FORT LARAMIE

WE SEE many INDIANS camped willy-nilly outside the

fires Dogs run around loose

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I thought forts were for soldiers

SETH CECIL
The Indians are outside drunk
The soldiers are inside drunker

MARY MARGARET CECIL
If Dick Cecil is here hell soon
be wishing he was drunk

CHARLIE wanders over to an INDIAN tending four or five

WE SEE rows of barracks along the inside of the stockade

A large burly soldier comes slowly over to have a look at

the newcomers carbine in hand

SETH CECIL
Hello Ned Have you come to
arrest us

Hearing his name seems to startle the large soldier

NED
(sways a bit)
Seth Cecil is that you

Then he notices MARY MARGARET and NEVA in the wagon Stops
and takes off his cap which he promptly drops in the mud

When he opens his mouth to speak all that comes out is a big
rumbling belch
NED
Pardon me ma‘am I believe I’ve
et too much

When he reaches down to pick up his cap he falls flat on his
face in the mud Doesnt move

SETH CECIL
Dead drunk I fear

He dismounts

inquire about Dick

has presents for the children Seeing him about to go is
almost as hard on them as watching AUNT ROSIE sail off in
Omaha

NEVA CECIL

teach us Indian songs when you
leave

CHARLIE SEVEN DAYS
You have many young fellows here to
teach you songs after I go

EXT FORT LARAMIE WYOMING PARADE GROUND DAY LATER 117
SHAY comes out of the cabin barracks looking around The
sun is shining brightly reflecting off the snow He has to
shade his eyes to see

He sees SETH over by the BLACKSMITH where one of the horses
is being re-shod

He sees NEVA talking to CAPTAIN MOLESWORTH who has taken
quite a shine to her as had most of the other young
officers It is clear they like one another

Be sees MARY MARGARET over in a corner of the stockade
standing and visiting with a YOUNG INDIAN WOMAN who has set
up a lodge of skins built against the poles there MARCY
toddles around with a little girl maybe a few months older
than she is

When MARY MARGARET spots SHAY she waves him over

EXT FORT LARAMIE WYOMING CORNER OF STOCKADE DAY 118
CONTINUOUS

When SHAY walks up the TWO LITTLE GIRLS are staring at one
another solemnly Now and then one of them stoops and feels
the snow

The INDIAN WOMAN is friendly about MARY MARGARET’S age-
smiles

MARY MARGARET stoops looks at the little girls closely

SHAY CECIL
Theyre just the right age to be
playmates

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I think they’re a little more than
Laymates Shay Take a closer
ook

SHAY puzzled stoops Looks closely at the girls

MARY MARGARET CECIL
See the dimple in their chins
That’s Dicks dimple--the same as
Marcy and you and Neva ‘These
little girls are half sisters like
me and your Aunt Rosie

(pause)

This is your father’s other family
that Ive come all this way to find
out about

Then TWO INDIAN BOYS close to SHAY’S age come out from inside
the little skin lodge Both have dimples in their chins
too

MARY MARGARET CECIL
It’‘s no small familyand it ain’t
recent

MARY MARGARET stands Shakes her headshe’s angry then
she bursts into tears As she is about to walk past SHAY
she stops grabs him and shakes him in her hurt

MARY MARGARET CECIL
If you ever marry don’t treat your
wife like your father treats wives-—
giving them children then going
off and leaving them to fend for
themselves If you ever do that
and I hear about it I’‘1l come and
give you the shaking of your life
even if I’m ninety years old

She lets him go Hurries away leaving SHAY to ponder what
just happened

INT FORT LARAMIE WYOMING CABIN NIGHT 120

The INDIAN BOYS are gone SHAY and NEVA are up in the
sleeping loft

UNCLE SETH and MARY MARGARET are sitting near the fireplace
SETH has a jug of whiskey He whittles between swigs

Suddenly MARY MARGARET grabs the whiskey bottle takes a
long swig

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Its a bitter sore spot with me
Seth that you knew about Dick’s
Indian family all these years and
didn’t tell me

SETH CECIL
I’m a rattler not a tattler It
is not my place to go ‘blabbing
about something thats none of my
business

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Does that mean I’m none of your
business

The CHILDREN sit up listen intently
SETH doesn’t respond

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I guess that means you think it’s
right for a man to have two wives
-Is that your view

SETH CECIL
(uncomfortable)
Well it‘s the custom out here in
the baldies

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Oh I see Like handing out
tobacco and coffee when Indians
come to visit I suppose you think
handing out a woman is no
different

SETH CECIL
I said nothing of the sort though
in patriarch times a man was
allowed several wives I believe
It’s in the Bible

MARY MARGARET CECIL
What if I don’t want to go by the
Bible

SHAY CECIL
(startled blurts)
Ma everybodys supposed to go by
the Bible

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Don’t preach to your mother Shay
(looks at Seth)
I trusted you Seth I trusted you
to look after me and my children
I never trusted Dick for much of
anything

NEVA CECIL
(offended)
Mal

SETH CECIL
There goes that fool Fetterman
Guess he thinks theres going to be
trouble up north in the forts too

MARY MARGARET CECIL
There sure is and I intend to make
some of it myself

The entire troop passes at a gallop Not a single soldier
waves or looks their way

EXT WYOMING PLAIN CAMP MORNING 124

SETH CECIL
This leg was just fine before the
War If it weren’t for that dam

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Seth you can complain all the way
back to Adam and it wont make you
oung again Think you can walk on

She helps him up as BABY MARCY comes waddling up to the fire
carrying an arrow

SETH CECIL
(takes it from her)
Indians arent careless with
arrows it takes too long to make
one
(to Marcy)
Whered you get it honey

MARCY who has developed a stubborn streak doesn’t answer

SETH CECIL
Have we got anything to bribe her
with

An arrow like a signpost sticks in the ground next to them

SETH CECIL
This is getting repetitious

Jumps down pulls up the arrow

SETH CECIL

SHAY CECIL
If they’re watching us would you
know it

better eyes than old Kit Carson

NEVA and SHAY excited lope off ahead

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Well if it‘s the fort I hope
Dick’s handy so I can settle my
business with him

SETH CECIL
You realize Dick Cecil does not
like to be criticized by women or
by anybody else

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Too bad for him I didn’t come all
this way to kiss his feet
(look)
Are you getting ready to take his
side against me

lll

SETH CECIL
Well you’ve been mad at Dick
before this and got over it I
speculate that it’s just the Indian
family of his you don’t like

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(sighs)
In some ways you have less sense
than anybody I know

SETH CECIL
Thats a wild opinion if 1 ever
heard one

MARY MARGARET looks at him Checks to make sure the children
are not watching then suddenly she grabs SETHgives him a
long hard passionate Kise He’s too startled to return the
kiss of course and his eyes betray a riot of emotion——
shock delight caution confusion

When MARY finally breaks the kiss SETH looks punch-drunk
MARY MARGARET CECIL
I‘ve wanted to do that for a long
long time Sethand now that
were out here where we could be
Massacred any minute I thought I
better not pass up the chance
SETH is taking this in

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Arent you going to say anything

SETH CECIL

Spots his son and daughter racing toward them on Indian
a

The YounG INDIAN WOMAN seeg the change in him immediately
goes scurrying like a doe through the gates of the fort

DICK can hardly believe his eyes as his two children arrive

NEVA Jumps down from her horse He gives her a hug SHAY

MARY MARGARET and sEery pe2t up in the wagon sEeriy has
recovered Mostly from the surprise kiss “though he looks a

MARY MARGARET is Perfectly cool

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Why can’t you see Dick It’s
your family Your family
that is realize youve acquired
a few others

DICK CECIL
(shifts to Seth)
odd i

t i
Seid you could bring this bunch out
ere You oughtn’t to have allowed ‘

SETH CECIL
I didnt allow it It happened
despite me ‘ve argued against it
mile after mile al the way from

But here wa are
(Pause

It’s my Opinion that Shooting Mary

would have been the only way to

Stop her and I wasnt up to

shooting her

MARY MARGARET CECIL
That’s right He would have had to
shoot me to stop me and he wasn’t
up to shooting me Would you have
been up to shooting me Dick

DICK looks at SETH again but this time he doesn’t sound so
fierce

DICK CECIL
There must be some way to stop a
woman rather than let her drag a
wagon and a bunch of kids all this
way You could have hog-tied her
and left her in the cellar

NEVA CECIL
We dont have a cellar Pa

DICK seems confused

MARY MARGARET gets down from the wagon seat and marches over
to DICK looking him up and down from a short distance away

SETH looks nervous

SETH CECIL
The children and I better go on
into the fort and see if we can
scare up some fodder for the
livestock

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Seth shut up Don’t talk and
don‘t move This will just take a
minute

SETH CECIL
A minute After traveling all
these months

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Some things take months And other
things just take a minute

MARY MARGARET approaches DICK who watches her warily

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Youre not making me feel welcome
Dick--although I am your wife Am
I welcome

DICK CECIL
Did I ask you to come No So
youre not welcome

(MORE )

DICK CECIL (contd)
I expect you knew that before you
left home you independent hussy

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I did know it but I wanted to hear
it from you straight

DICK CECIL
Why

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Because I’m not the sort of woman
to quit aman through the mails I
can only quit a man face to face
and right here and now Im quitting
you

NEVA and SHAY are riveted MARCY awakens from her nap and
raises a wail

DICK CECIL
Good Lord you even brought the
baby

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Yes that’s Marcy--the child youve
never seen You understand me

Annoyed as he is this is not what DICK expected
DICK CECIL

We’re quits Quits for good Now

That is clearly the wrong thing to say because MARY MARGARET
colors up and gives him a roundhouse punch right in the
jawhe staggers back a few steps holding his face
SETH winces
SHAY winces
The WOODCHOPPERS all wince
ALL hold their jaws

MARY MARGARET CECIL

Not hasty Dick tardy ‘Tardy by

SETH CECIL
Did you really come all this way
just to tell Dick you were quitting
him If that was all you had to
tell him you could have sent me
with the news

MARY MARGARET CECIL
(exasperated)
No Seth I didnt send you
because I’m keeping you Or would
you rather just live out here and
run wild like your brother

SETH CECIL
(at once)
Not me I‘m so used to you now I
wouldn’t know what to do without
you

MARY MARGARET CECIL
That‘s right you wouldn’t

SETH CECIL
I would like to go visit with Dick

find out if the business is
prospering or if I’m a pauper

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Go Sherman and Geneva can help me
feed the stock

SETH goes

EXT WYOMING PLAIN LODGEPOLE RIDGE LONG SHOT CONTINUOUS A4

Slowly from the ridge between the woodcutters’ camp and the
fort WE SEE a troop of about eighty cavalry appear their

banner flying COLONEL FETTERMAN leads the troops still in
his white gloves

EXT WYOMING PLAIN CENTER OF VALLEY INDIANS CONTINUOUS445

The FIVE INDIANS now joined by the TWENTY who were circling
the wagons take fright when they see the cavalry-—they light
out across the valley for the nearest trees

Only the LONE INDIAN with the sorefooted horse seems
unconcerned He hops onto his horse watching the soldiers
for a moment before trotting off

EXT WYOMING PLAIN WOODCHOPPING CAMP WAGON DAY 146
CONTINUOUS

SETH however is far from unconcerned He stands up in the
wagon and begins to wave his arms as if to tell the cavalry
to turn back

SETH CECIL

Hell these young bucks are just
the decoys

SAM

Its the oldest trickthe
wounded bird

EXT WYOMING PLAIN LODGEPOLE RIDGE CAVALRY CONTINUOUS 147

FETTERMAN having spotted the INDIANS heading for the woods
raises his sabre

The bugler blows the charge

The cavalry races down the ridge and into the valley hoping
to cut off the INDIANS before they reach the woods

They make it deep into the valley but they arent catching
the INDIANS who are on fine quick horses

EXT WYOMING PLAIN WOODCHOPPING CAMP POV DAY CONTINUOUS 48

NEVA and SHAY scramble up into the wagon

NEVA CECIL
(shocked
Pa youre hit

She kneels down next to him
Just then THEY and WE SEE HEAR a loud rustling

SAM
Oh Lord

The woods on evey side boil with movement So much snow
kicked into the air that it looks like some kind of
avalanche at first Then a dramatic sight as all are
transfixed

WE SEE almost a thousand INDIANS close around the cavalrymen
The few cavalrymen who try to retreat are quickly cut down

SHAY CECIL
Uncle Seth whatll we do

SETH CECIL
They don’t want us Shaythey
want Fetterman

There are so many arrows in the air that they make a cloud

Arrows and lances skewer men on the run while others are
hacked down with hatchets

Pockets with FIVE OR SIX CAVALRYMEN each are surrounded by
INDIANS the CAVALRYMEN fight for their lives and lose
Fall

EXT WYOMING PLAIN WOODCHOPPING CAMP UNDER THE WAGON DAYW9
FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

The WOODCUTTERS meanwhile are frozen by the spectacle
Even SAM the experienced frontiersman is amazed

SETH CECIL
We better go while they’re busy
The killing frenzy’s on them they
might not be able to stop
(to the woodcutters)
Come on boys whip up Now’s our
chance if weve got a chance

The WOODCUTTERS come unfrozen load up and WE WATCH in a
LONG WIDE SHOT their wild race for the fort which is to the
ridge the cavalry has just come over

EXT WYOMING PLAIN CENTER OF VALLEY MASSACRE CONTINUOUS50
WE SEE COLONEL FETTERMAN surrounded

The Sioux close in on him

He takes out his pistol Pires shoots one Indian

Then turns the pistol shoots himself in the head

Just as SETH (driving the wagon) DICK SAM SHAY NEVA and
the others in the wood wagons reach the crest of LODGEPOLE

RIDGE they meet MARY MARGARET in her wagon The rest of

the WOODCUTTERS sweep past them to the fort

SETH CECIL

EXT WYOMING PLAIN CENTER OF VALLEY MASSACRE CONTINUOUS52

SETH is right below them across the valley WE SEE the
INDIANS going around picking up rifles and pistols pulling

cartridge belts off soldiers picking up arrows and hatchets
and collecting their own dead

But then in only a minute or two every single INDIAN is

gone melting back into the woods they had just come racing
out of

EXT WYOMING PLAIN LODGEPOLE RIDGE DAY CONTINUOUS 153

SAM
There may be some wounded It
would be unusual for every last man
to be killed stone dead in a
fracas like this

MARY MARGARET CECIL

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Go pick up the wounded If we
wait some of them might die

SHAY CECIL vo
-My name is Sherman Cecilbut

(pause)
el Was a mere boy during the
Civil War Id stories of

the hundreds and thousands that
died at Gettysburg Vicksburg and
the other great battles But I saw
these eighty dead men in the full
glory of their lives racing down
on their foes like cavalrymen are
supposed to--and now they were all
dead I felt like I was seeing all
the dead of all the wars spread
out over that plainand I was no
longer a boy

WE SEE COLONEL FETTERMAN’S BODY leaning against one of the
rocks Eyes wide Dead of suicide

SETH CECIL
Fetterman done for himself He got
off easy

MARY MARGARET CECIL
And he cost eighty mothers their
sons

SAM
(shakes his head)
I have never seen that many Indians
in one force

DICK CECIL
That many Indians could take the
fortlow on ammunition as we are
(MORE )

DIcK CECIL (contd)
A victory like this will surely
pump them up

SETH CECIL
We better bunk in the fort tonight

Colonel won’t be there to throw
Mary out

They all take one last look

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Id hate to have eighty deaths on
my conscience

SHAY CECIL V0
-When it began to get dark we all
loaded our gunsand we waited
(pause)
Ma and Pa and Uncle Seth stood
together waiting for the Indians
to come But what came instead was
the moonthe biggest brightest
moon any of us had ever seen in our
lives floated up into the sky that
night and lit the plain like a
giant golden lamp

WE SEE a YOUNG OFFICER look at an almanacshows NEVA what
he finds

SHAY CECIL V0O

--Young Lieutenant Wiley who had
taken such a shine to Neva looked
in his almanac and found the
reason the moon was closer to the
earth that night than it had been
for one hundred and fifty years--
and closer than it would be until
1999 when even Baby Marcy would be
lucky to have a grandchild still
alive

(pause)
None of us who saw that big power
moon would ever forget it
157

EXT FORT PHIL KEARNY WYOMING NIGHT CLOSE TO MORNING 157
LATER

The great moon is still up still huge though its moved to
the other side of the sky

MARY MARGARET SETH and DICK all stand with rifles in their
hands DICKS arm in a sling

DICK CECIL
I have never been no hand to wait

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Don’t I know it

SETH CECIL
If the Sioux and Cheyenne are
coming I wish theyd come

MARY MARGARET CECIL
They won’t come

DICK CECIL
- (mild)
When did you come to know so much
about Indians

MARY MARGARET CECIL
They wont come They gave Colonel
Fetterman his comeuppanceand I
expect that satisfied them

MARY MARGARET shivers SETH stomps his feet once or twice
tries to warm himself

SETH CECIL
I wish wed brought in more of the
dead Now we‘ll have to wait for a
thaw

MARY MARGARET looks at the huge moon

MARY MARGARET CECIL
It’s ail right Seth There’s this
fine moon to shine on them They’re
like my boys--gone to their peace

Below NEVA unworried is dancing wildly to an old man‘s
fiddle and harmonica

Several soldiers watch Then join in

DICK looks down upon his lively daughter

DICK CECIL
She dances like you Mary Like
you danced when you were young and
frisky

SETH CECIL
You better watch it Dick The
fact is Mary’s still young and
frisky

WE SEE THE THREE FIGURES SETH DICK and MARY MARGARET

whose radiance lights the whole prairie

SHAY CECIL Vo
-Neva fought Ma to a standstill
and stayed in the west with Pa In
neo time she mastered the Sioux
language and was ever in demand as
an interpreter At the big peace
conference in 19868 when the Army
had to finally knuckle under to
Chief Red Cloud and agree to close
those three forts they had
foolishly built in Wyoming Neva
translated for General Sherman

WE SEE NEVA in a photograph between RED CLOUD and GENERAL
SHERMAN at a big peace pow wow

SHAY CECIL V0
--Then before you could blink
Red Cloud stole Neva from General
Sherman and took her to New York
City

WE SEE NEVA at Cooper Union as Red Cloud delivers his
stately oration

SHAY CECIL VQ
»-And next thing we knew Buffalo
Bill stole her from Red Cloud and
hired her to keep Sitting Bull
happy between acts at the Wild West
Show

WE SEE NEVA playing ping-pong with SITTING BULL in full
regalia at BUFFALO BILL CODYS WILD WEST SHOW

SHAY CECIL V0O
-To her credit Neva devoted a
lot of her time to Pa’s Indian
wives and children

WE SEE a group photo of DICK with his three wives and
seventeen children

SHAY CECIL V0O
--But that ended pronto after Pa
bought a sawmill up in Oregon and
happened to be in the wrong place
at the wrong time A big saw blade
snapped just at the wrong moment
and took Pa‘s head clean off

WE SEE DICK at the sawmill just before he’s killed

SHAY CECIL V0
--A maiden aunt in Ohio left Uncle
Seth a big patch of oily swamp

WE SEE MARY MARGARET and SETH inspecting this dismal
swampSETH cussing because he has stepped in an oil puddle
and ruined his shoes

SHAY CECIL V0O
-Uncle Seth was for selling the
) oily mess but Ma fought him like a
tigress She thought there was a
future in oil and she was right

WE MARY MARGARET and SETH standing in a thicket of DERRICKS

SHAY CECIL V0O
When Uncle Seth got rich he and
Ma bought themselves a big mansion
on Lindell Boulevard in st Louis
They argued their way through fifty
years and were never parted except
at night when Uncle Seth insisted
on sleeping outdoors He never
tired of looking up and seeing the
stars

WE SEE SETH in the backyard stargazing
SHAY CECIL VO
«--Ma put up with it for a few
years and then she got enough of
putting up with it
WE SEE MARY MARGARET outside at night pummeling SETH hard

UNCLE SETH finally fights her off

SETH CECIL
What the hell did I do now

MARY MARGARET CECIL
The main reason to put up with a
man is so you’1 have someone to
scratch youx back in the middle of
the night if your back happens to
be itchy which the man can’t do if
he’s bunking outside

They Look at one another

SETH sees it’s not exactly back-scratching shes talking
about He gets up collects his pallet

SETH CECIL
An itchy back is a damned
aggravation You should have spoke
up sooner

Together they go inside

mMarry-

ROPER ANOTHER INDIAN A COWBOY

SHAY CECIL VO
oe Being a famous interpreter
didnt keep Neva from outrunning Pa
in the marrying race Every year
or so the stationmaster in St
Louis would get ahold of Ma and
inform her that another toddler had
arrived with a note from Neva
pinned to its shirt

WE SEE MARY MARGARET and SETH with these toddlers at the
station BEN LITTLE BAT JOSIE ARMSTRONG WILLY TICKNOR

SHAY CECIL VO

lilting soprano voice

SHAY CECIL V0 (contd)
Ma sent her to Burope to train it
thoroughly which she did and the
next thing we knew she was a famous
opera singer

WE SEE MARY MARGARET and SETH in an opulent box at the St
Louis opera listening to MARCY belt out Verdi

SETH CECIL
(at a break in the
singing)

Reminds me too much of a Cheyenne
scalping party

MARY MARGARET CECIL
Shut up and clap when youre told
to clap

SHAY CECIL V0o
--On our way back from Wyoming
coming across Kansas with Ma
pregnant and fussy and Uncle Seth
doing the driving I happened to
spot an old tattered law book that
had dropped out of some settiler’s
wagon

WE SEE SHAY find the law book

SHAY CECIL V0
---I read that battered old book
the rest of the way home I guess
you could say I got seduced by the
law Then and there I determined
to be a lawyer maybe even a judge
which pleased Ma but didn’t please
Uncle Seth

SETH CECIL
Does a chicken have loyalty Does
a lawyer If Shay makes a judge
the next thing you know he’ll find
against us in court

MARY MARGARET CECIL
I wish the day would come when you
agree with me about something
Seth Just once

WE SEE SETH and MARY MARGARET in rocking chairs on their big
porch on Lindellargquingnow and then holding hands

WE SEE SHAY now in Judges robes resignedly watching a wild
melee in his courtroom a family dispute having gotten out of
hand people punching and biting one another

SHAY CECIL VQ
You don’t have to be on the
bench long to realize that family
cases are the hardest to settle
Give me robbers and killers any
day It’s deuced hard to know
where a family story starts and no
cinch to figure out where one
stops either

AND NOW WE BEGIN a brief reprise of scenes he is talking
aboutFirst MARY MARGARET looking at the dead horse

SHAY CECIL VQ
Look at our story the Cecils
did our story begin the day Ma shot
Baldy Stone’s horse because she
thought it was an elk Did Ma
always prefer Uncle Seth to Pa

WE SEE them by the fire in Fort Laramie

SHAY CECIL VO
««Did Pa wander the West for
years hoping his brother would
relieve him of his outspoken
wife

WE SEE DICK with his axe and his PREGNANT INDIAN WIFE

SHAY CECIL V0O
--Did Uncle Seth mean from the
first to steal his brother’s wife
Did they all know what they were
doing or half know or just
blunder on

WE SEE SETH dancing with MARY MARGARET on the riverboat

SHAY CECIL V0O
---Ive pondered these matters for
many years but I confess I still
cant phrase it out tidily like we
try to do in the courts of law

WE GO BACK TO FORT PHIL KEARNY to the parapets and to the
big golden moon

SHAY CECIL V0
«I guess what life finally taught
me is that not all questions have
answers Now and then I dream
we’re back at Fort Phil Kearny in
the time when we were all together
And Neva was dancing for the
soldiers

WE SEE NEVA dancing

SHAY CECIL V0O
---And Ma and Pa and Uncle Seth
stood there together with their
rifles waiting for the Indians
that never camethey had just
melted back into their holy

hills

WE SEE the THREE STLHOUETTES
SHAY CECIL VO

«--I remember them all as they were
that last night standing on the
parapets while that great power
moon lit up all the prairie and the
woods as clear as daylighta moon
like a white sun that shone so
brightly that shone upon the
living and the dead

Then FADE TO BLACK
