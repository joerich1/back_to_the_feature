persistence Never stop Never
take NO for an answer You hear no

yourself Even more than you
desire you must believe “I am

people in their homes awake watching the news on TV He
jerks his trash can upright It tilts still messed up froma
year ago when he kicked it and the wheel came off

HIS FAMILY hurry from their dark house silently pile into a
car SOFT-SHUT doors

Frank sees Dan freezes But only for a moment Frank quickly
slides into his car pulls out of the driveway LIGHTS OFF

haven’t seen him in a while

EMMY (CONTD)
Itll be light in a couple hours I
should sleep

DAN
Id like to join you

EMMY
Dan we’re both exhausted
THE TOMORROW WAR 13

DAN
I don’t think it’s good for her to
wonder why her parents don’t sleep
in the same room

EMMY DAN (CONTD)
What’s not good for her is We don’t fight every day
watching her parents fight
every day

EMMY DAN (CONTD)
What’s not good for her is You can’t put all this on me
having a remote father whose
never around

EMMY
I’m not I make plenty of mistakes
But I make an effort And she will
learn what is normal from ME and
YOU She’ll model our family when
she wants one of her own

DAN
Model Her life is a cake walk
compared to what I grew up in My
Dad gave up on me and left

EMMY
Do you think you’re actually here

Emmy looks at him Looks into his eyes

EMMY (CONTD)
There’s this tiny light in your
eyes that let’s me know when you’re
here And when you’re not And
you’re not here

She grabs his hands

EMMY (CONT’D)
But we ARE HERE -- and we need you
Your daughter needs you We have to
make our little corner of the world

The entire world’s collapsing
around us and you want to debate
with me about making it better for
our daughter

DAN
I didn’t say I wouldn’t--

EMMY
But you didn’t say you would

to answer she cuts him off--

EMMY (CONTD)
You take me for granted I’m going
through something too And you’re
making me handle it alone And the
crazy thing is if all this wasn’t
happening Id probably let it go
Like I always do me’

at her husband

EMMY (CONTD)
But you and I both know what’s
happening between us started before
there was ever a draft or a future
war So I’m going to stop acting
like me asking you for help in this
family is you doing me a favor

Cleaning them Pocketing them

You’re so full of shit There’s no

DAN
You can sell those things for a

as a necklace

DORIAN

(looks at it)
This one ain’t for sale It’s a
claw That’s rarer than spikes I
got it on my first jump St
Petersburg Russia Near ground

I was boxed in with a gut-shot Real-
Time Russian He’d been there when
the first spike was killed in ‘48
carved this off

(he touches his necklace)
The spikes were five minutes from
reaching us I was a minute from
jumping back We traded his idea--

(tugs at the claw)
-- this claw for saving him from
being drug to a spike nest and
eaten alive

You got him out

Muri dries the plate under a stream of INERT GAS places it
on a mat Dan has just sterilized He hands her an eppendorf
tube containing the Matrix Solution --

It’s painstaking and close Muri places one tiny droplet of
the Matrix Solution into the small circle Dan follows with a
droplet of the Analyte Solution Then using a pipet Dan
mixes the solution in the circle --

We zip through Catching snippets of them - focused
determined Each loving the work Each feeling the pressure
but still noting the ease - the pleasure - of working
together They LOAD PLATE after PLATE with droplets

How

DAN
Is it possible the Whitespikes
landed before 2048 They searched
all over Northern Russia where they
were first sighted and never found
any sign of impact They can’t have
landed there right They must’ve
landed somewhere else Is there any
part of the world remote enough
that they could go undetected for a
couple years

CHARLIE

They found plastic at the bottom of
the Mariana Trench There aren’t
many untouched places left on
Earth but it’s theoretically
possible The Whitespikes do nest
underground Maybe they hibernated
Mated Built up their numbers
before attacking

DAN
If there are so few places they
could hide undetected it shouldn’t
be too hard to monitor those for
anything crashing into them right

Dorian is not happy to see them

DORIAN
Did you miss me

Dorian finishes his drink reaches over the bar to grab a
bottle Dan notices there’s no bartender

DAN
Guess there’s no one to stop you

Dorian refills his glass

DORIAN
Stop me There’s no stopping
anything

Dorian nods to a TV playing news footage of riots

DAN
We could end all of this But I
need your claw

DORIAN
It’s over We broke the world

Dorian drops the bottle back behind the bar Dan studies him
for a beat Watches Dorian drinking

DORIAN (CONTD)
The future’s here to make us pay
for our sins No sense fighting it
It comes for us all

Dorian spits on the floor in disgust A beat as Charlie and
Dan exchange a look - the reality slowly dawning on them

DAN
Youre sick arent you

CHARLIE
Yeah and not just like in the
head Like sick sick

Dorian hesitates then

DORIAN

It was eating me up Army guy said
they weren’t allowed to say cause
but break a few fingers in the
parking lot and pancreatic cancer
pops out

DAN
I’m sorry
(beat)
For the Army guy

Dorian can’t help but laugh a little Eases the tension

DORIAN
Here I was a dead man with
nothing Here I’m supposed to die
But in the future I got nothing to
lose I live while everyone around
me dies I’m larger than life I’m
a T-Rex A hero A god There’s
gotta be a reason for that

DAN
And what do you think that is

DORIAN
(smiling)
Maybe it’s because I’m pretty

Charlie laughs Dorian shoots him a look and he turns it into
a cough

CHARLIE
Could really be a number of
different reasons
(nervous )
Lotta scenarios at play here

DAN
I think it’s because you’re
supposed to help us You said you’d
rather die in the war than live a
slow death back home

Dorian throws back a shot - studying Dan
CHARLIE
I can’t imagine the drinking is

helping the cancer situation

Dorian shoots him a death stare Charlie backs down
THE TOMORROW WAR Green Revisions 111519 123

DAN
They said you only had six months
That was almost a year ago You
should know more than anyone the
future isn’t written in stone

Dorian looks at Dan starting to believe him

DAN (CONT’D)
Youve already changed yours Help
me change the rest of ours

DORIAN
Saving people is your game
Forester - not mine

DAN
I’m not trying to save everyone
I’m just trying to save my
daughter But if I’ve gotta save
the whole world to save her - then
I’m sure as hell going to do it
What if I told you this was the
reason you keep surviving That
this was the moment you’ve been
waiting for your whole goddamn
life What would you say to that

would have to be from The

MARTIN
The Changbai volcano on the border
of China and Korea erupted in 946
AD with the force of over a
thousand nuclear bombs It blew ash
over half the world Today you can
still find that ash buried in ice

experiments in The Academy of

found volcanic ash at a depth of

JAMES

DAN

JAMES
My hands are shaking because it’s
freezing

DAN

I can’t watch you and kill it at
the same time

JAMES
Great I’11 kill it You watch
The only thing you have to watch is
me killing it

DAN
You can barely stand

That’s what adrenaline’s for Come

DAN
Dad Stop I know what I’m doing

Dan runs off Jumps on a snowmobile Peels out James watches
him go Then looks over at ANOTHER SNOWMOBILE NEARBY

Dan gets off the snowmobile Shielding his face from the icy
wind and snow he follows the Whitespike tracks But
suddenly the tracks stop Dan swivels gun up searching for
the Whitespike when --

JAMES (0OS)
HEY ASSHOLE OVER HERE YOU SKULL
FACED OCTOPUS-LOOKING ALIEN-DICK
COLD BEER and OLD MAN I got cold
beer and Tough Old Man Who wants

Dan turns sees JAMES in the distance waving his arms

JAMES (CONTD)
Over here Come and get some
THE TOMORROW WAR Green Revisions 111519 147

DAN
What is he doing

ELSEWHERE ON THE GLACIER A mound of snow shifts The Female
Whitespike emerges from it She was hiding She runs off

Dan hears the galloping Whitespike He looks over sees it’s
running towards James Dan pulls up his gun

SCOPE POV Just as the crosshairs center on the Whitespike
the snowy wind completely obscures her Dan can’t see her
Shit He runs for his snowmobile jumps on and peels out
after her

The Whitespike runs across the glacier gallops over a ridge

WHITESPIKE POV James with his back to her

The Whitespike attacks James As she rips him apart we
see it was a SNOWMAN The Whitespike pauses confused

BAM BAM She’s shot TWICE in the head She turns to see --

JAMES lying on a ridge nearby shooting The Whitespike
charges at him He keeps firing but she’s getting closer

VROOOOOOM DAN APPEARS ON A SNOWMOBILE

He’s heading straight for the Whitespike gaining speed
Faster and faster and just as he hits a small ledge and goes
airborne Dan jumps and rolls off the snowmobile and sends it
CRASHING into the Whitespike

The Whitespike gets back up Dan and James advance on her
firing dodging spikes Dan’s shooting more conservatively

DAN (CONT’D)
Save your bullets

JAMES
I’m making an opening Strafe
right I’1l strafe left

James peels off from Dan going around the side of the
Whitespike drawing her attention She turns towards James
and Dan gets a GOOD SHOT in her abdomen Dan looks at his
Dad This can work They start alternating fire dodging and
rolling to their next positions taking aim firing moving
never stopping Throwing the alien off its game Getting in
their shots in fast One shot particular close to the
alien’s vitals

The Whitespike shrieks and quickly disappears backwards into
the blowing snow
THE TOMORROW WAR Green Revisions 111519 148

Dan and James train their guns on where they last saw her
These men are hunters They know She’s still around They go
back-to-back as they move along hunting her as she hunts
them They lost her

Behind them the Whitespike JUMPS OUT OF THE SNOW

The Whitespike swings at Dan He blocks with the machine gun
The gun is ripped in half Quickly Dan switches to the pistol
until he runs out of ammo The Whitespike wraps its tentacle

around Dan’s leg and throws him back James gets a few shots

in on the Whitespike The Whitespike uppercuts James sending

him flying back

The Whitespike shoots spikes PFT PFT One hits Dan in the
THIGH He falls back The Whitespike picks Dan up in the air
Dan takes the spike out of his THIGH and sticks it in the
Whitespike’s mouth the spike comes out through the
Whitespike’s left orbital destroying its left eye

James comes running in with the pick axe and JAMS it into the
Whitespike’s right eye blinding it completely

Dan uses his feet to push off the Whitespike falling
backwards and separating them Blinded the Whitespike flails
wildly moving toward Dan James runs in The Whitespike is
about to lunge at Dan when James stabs her tail with his
pick

JAMES (CONTD)
Youve got her right where you want
her Do it

Dan pulls out THE TOXIN But the Whitespike grazes him and
the Toxin goes flying The toxin lands on the ground Dan
tries to grab it but the Whitespike is moving around it
threatening to crush the toxin A near miss then Dan rolls
and grabs it He stabs it into the Whitespike’s arm

Then-- CRACK She CLOCKS him sending him barreling
backwards

The Whitespike watches the toxin SIZZLE and BUBBLE down her
arm She start grasping at her throat her head her face
She’s dying in a glorious hideous fashion But then She
finds the spike in her mouth Grips it And with a gut-
wrenching scream pulls the spike out through her head and out
of her mouth Then she opens her jaw wide and BITES OFF HER
OWN ARM BEFORE THE POISON CAN SPREAD ANY FURTHER Her dead
arm falls to the ground - still bubbling

Dan and James are besides themselves Out of breath Out of
ammo Out of toxin Out of time
THE TOMORROW WAR Green Revisions 111519 149

DAN
(deadpan)
Well Shit

The Whitespike hears Dan She moves through the snow on four
legs mouth open teeth dripping She’s heading right at him

Dan backs up Suddenly he realizes he’s on the edge of the
cliff Shit he’s got nowhere to go Every move he makes
attracts her to him He tries to remain still But she keeps
coming We see the CLAW NECKLACE coming out of his shirt

James several feet away sees Dan on the edge of the cliff
The Whitespike feet away He’s got to do something

JAMES
(loud enough for Dan to
hear and attract the
alien)
Dan I never got to meet your kid

The Whitespike CLOCKS the sound and turns to James He takes
out a knife and cuts his own hand Holds it up The alien
sniffs The blood It draws her to him and away from Dan

JAMES (CONTD)
But if she’s anything like you said
she is well

James moves closer and closer towards THE CLIFF

JAMES (CONT’D)
--Il’m sure she takes after you

Dan sees that James is about to sacrifice himself Dan
struggles to get to his feet

DAN
Dad no

James looks at Dan

JAMES
Tell Muri something for me

His face changes The anger fades -- it’s just remorse

JAMES (CONTD)
Her dad deserves a second chance
too

James stands at the edge of the cliff He looks towards the
Whitespike running towards him Ready for it to take him
over the edge
THE TOMORROW WAR Green Revisions 111519 150

JAMES (CONTD)
I’m sorry For everything

DAN

Dan holding THE CLAW runs up from behind the Whitespike and
jumps on its back He jams the claw into its cervical
vertebrae at the top of its neckbase of its skull The
Whitespike STOPS SHRIEKS IN PAIN Dan flies off

The Whitespike clumsily stumbles forward losing control of
its movements Dan using the claw in rapid strikes like a
master samurai cuts its throat its belly all the way down
its body

DAN (CONTD)
Die

She looks at him wheezing barely alive It roars one last
roar And Dan kicks it off the cliff

She falls in pieces to her death IT’S OVER

Dan collapses in the snow exhausted James sits next to him
also exhausted

JAMES
Did you tell it to die

DAN
Yeah

JAMES
It worked

They are in too much pain to laugh or do anything but lie
buried in the snow exhausted

JAMES (CONTD)
Why didn’t you tell it sooner

WE PULL WAY BACK See a limping Charlie moving to join them

DAN
So you said you were sorry about
“everything”

JAMES
Yeah

DAN
Would you care to elaborate Can
you name some specifics
