EXT IDYLLIC AMERICAN LANDSCAPE

A red sky and rolling farmland cradled by dark wooded
foothills and rocky cliffs

A young grubby 14-year-old TREVOR OWENS runs happily
t

throug e pastures sneaking around the trees and popping
out with a toy gun

TREVOR
With nowhere left to run he knew
hed have to fight for his life
He sneaks around from tree to tree

TREVOR (CONTD)
Look out I know you out there

A dash to another tree his toy gun held tight

TREVOR (CONTD)
Here I COME

He lea out from behind the tree and fires his toy gun
to)

s
ata playmate who isnt there Hes playing all alone on
the hill

TREVOR (CONTD)
Yea Gotcha Yer dead punk

He stops firing as a cold wind rustles the leaves at his
eet

Trevor looks far across the valley then back to his own

lonely desolate home A forgotten farmhouse and grey-
weathered barn slouched alone on the ragged landscape

FREAKS OF THE HEARTLAND
DISSOLVE TO
EXT OWENS FARM - DUSK

Trevor finally makes it home As he walks past the barn he
casts it a curious glance

INT OWENS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Trevor pulls back the dusty screen door to find his Paw
HENRY OWENS hovering over his worn-out recliner
fiddling with the reception on an absurdly small rabbit-eared
television Hes an eccentric country grump set in his ways

PAW
Youre late

TREVOR
Lost track a time I guess

PAW
Lose more than that it happens again

TREVOR
Yessir
PAW
(to the television)
Youre as bad as this numbnuts

INT OWENS HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

A dingy kitchen tableau Trevors wearing an apron pulling
two tv dinners from a chest freezer full of them

CUT TO
INT OWENS HOUSE DINING ROOM
Dinner that night is a quiet affair Trevor picks at his

Salisbury steak TV dinner while his Paw yells at the TV in
the other room

PAW
Aw Would you look at this
moneygrubber

Paw takes a long gulp from his tincan beer

Trevor turns to see what hes barking about on the TV a
Peoples Court type show A fat female plaintiff screaming

TREVOR
You think shes guilty Paw

PAW
Sure as rain Shes hidin something

TREVOR
Mmm I dunno

Hes interrupted by a MUFFLED PHONE RINGING

They both freeze It keeps RINGING faintly through the
dusty home

PAW
You been messing with the phone again

TREVOR
No sir I aint even touched it

PAW
-Aw what the christ
Paw creeps up the stairs as Trevor listens intently
FOOTSTEPS across the SQUEAKING FLOOR

Trevor crosses the room and flips through the tvs few
fuzzy channels looking for something to watch

We hear the UNLOCKING of Paws room as the PHONE RINGING
warbles louder

PAW (0S) (CONTD)
Whos this How you get this number --
Hmph Well That might be alright
so long as yer serious Right then

Trevor picks at his peas and carrots curiously as the
FOOTSTEPS of Paw come down the CREAKY staircase
Henry Owens shuffles back into the room

TREVOR
Um who was that Paw

Paw switches the tv back to the courtroom show

PAW
Just some business

TREVOR
Dont nobody ever call us

PAW
Some folk might be coming out tomorrow
or the next day So you know the
drill

TREVOR
Yea I know act normal

Paw cracks the slightest grin as he sips swill from his beer

PAW
You still remember what normal is
right

TREVOR
Sure

PAW
At least that makes one of us

TREVOR
Can I be excused

PAW
Gimme a beer will ya

Trevor clears his TV dinner and grabs his Paw a cold one
He hands off the beer and stomps towards his room

PAW (CONTD)
You still got chores

TREVOR
Naw I done ‘em all

Paw cracks his beer turns his chair away from Trevor

PAW
Then go feed yer brother

TREVOR
I know Ill take care of him

Trevor heads off out back
PAW
And mind the lip while yer at it

(back at the tv)
Degenerate bums
IN THE HALLWAY --
Trevor grabs the key off the hook
EXT OWENS HOUSE - BACK PORCH

Trevor grabs a few cans of corned beef from the rickety
shelves

PAW (0S)
And dont give him too much this
time

Trevor sneers and grabs a few more to spite him Piling the
cans in an old bucket

He heads out into the darkness the rusty screen door slamming
behind him

EXT BARN - NIGHT

Trevor walks the dark path towards the creepy forgotten
barn An owl HOOTS Wind blows forgotten leaves

As Trevor gets closer the massive barn door bounces RATTLING
against the heavy chains and padlock that keep it locked
shut Is that the wind or something inside there

Trevor fumbles with the key its so dark out here but we
can see SOMETHING MOVING IN SHADOW under the door

Trevor finally gets the heavy padlock open
INT BARN - NIGHT

The heavy doors are pushed open by Trevor Inside the dusty
barn is only full of moonlight and eerie noise

Trevor creeps in slowly Tiptoes past the cobwebbed plows
and tackle

He finally reaches the middle of the spooky creaky barn
where he finds the one hanging bulb

He flicks it on and the barn is dripped in orange light and
stark dangling shadow

BEHIND HIM a movement in the darkness What is it A
terrifying ENORMOUS SHAPE RISES BEHIND TREVOR It
approaches LOOMS OVER HIM ITS RIGHT BEHIND HIM

We whip around to meet

A massive misshapen freak that stands at a hunched seven
feet tall He looks like he could tear a man in half

TREVOR
(casually)
Boy you need a bath critter I could
smell you outside

In a flash this monsters massive deformed skull eases into
THE SWEETEST SMILE YOUVE EVER SEEN His eyes shine as he
runs to his beloved brother
This is WILL OWENS Trevors seven-year old brother He
speaks in a slow deep gravely voice

WILL
Trevvooor

Will jumps like a happy harmless puppy His monstrous arms
slash out and nab the canned meat from his hands in the blink
of an eye

TREVOR
Hey Quit grabbing ya darn
elephant

Will trots back to his small corner of the barn

Theres a dingy baseball cap some weathered encyclopedias
A stained prairie quilt

WILL
--Thank you Treevoor

Will tears the cans open WITH HIS BARE HANDS smashing the
meat paste into his misshapen jaw

TREVOR
Alright whatever Help yourself

Trevor walks out but Wills MASSIVE arm reaches over and
grabs his overalls yanking him back

TREVOR (CONTD)
Ow leggo Jeez critter

But Will doesnt know his own strength and BANGS TREVORS
KNEES into the stall as he drags him back

TREVOR (CONTD)
ACHHH Watch what yer doin God

WILL
Thank you Treev-ooor

TREVOR
Yea yea Better out here than with
Paw Just try and get some of
that slop into your mouth while yer

-Paw

Will chomps through his canned meat messily while Trevor
picks up the old encyclopedias scattered about

TREVOR
You want I should read you a lesson

WILL
Oh yessss Trevvoorr red a red
firetruck
TREVOR
Firetruck Naw dummy we aint even

WILL

Will slinks over like a giddy ch child his fingers grody with
meatpaste and looking for a hug

TREVOR
Ew back off train wreck Thats
gross

But Will just LAUGHS LIKE A MULE chasing his brother around
the room

Trevor climbs over stalls and leaps through the air each
time his mighty brother is there to grab him just in time

Trevor knows this and happit makes DEATH-DEFYING LEAPS
always trusting that his brothers massive arms will be there
to catch him

TREVOR (CONTD)
Stop it Hahaha Get your
boogernails off me

WILL
Trevvvoorr he he he

Trevor breaks loose laughing and dashes out of Wills grasp
leaping OUTSIDE

Will chases him until SNAP Hes jerked back by the LARGE
CHAINS attached to his wrists

Trevors smile disappears sad to see these chains that must
keep the family secret trapped in inside the barn Its an
awkward moment between the boys

He stands in the deepening night looking back at his brother
stopped just short of the doorway and fresh air

TREVOR
I better go I oo be back later
little brother Tonight me and
you goin out

Will lowers his head and shuffles back into the darkness of
the barn pulling the chain-light off behind him

DISSOLVE TO

INT OWENS HOUSE HALLWAY - LATE THAT NIGHT

Trevor throws his coat over his pjs and sneaks past his
FATHER WHO IS SNORING IN FRONT OF THE TV

Trevor freezes in his tracks when he notices an OLD REVOLVER

dangling from his dads hand an empty bottle of booze from
the other

Trevors not sure what his dad had in mind but he quietly
grabs the gun and tucks it in his overalls just in case

SERIES OF SHOTS

The guns stuffed in a hallway closet

The keys quietly lifted off its hook

The unlocking of Wills neck collar

EXT OWENS BARN - NIGHT

We see THE SMALL SHADOW OF A BOY creep cross the yard

followed by THE HUGE SILHOUETTE OF WILL sneaking out of the
barn and into the fields

Will tries to hide behind some bushes but at his size its
a little funny

Trevor pushes him on

(hushed from a distance)
Dont just stand there move it you
freak

EXT FIELD - NIGHT

Will is striding freely through the night fields These are
the highlights of his life

Trevor sprints up playfully alongside him toy gun in hand

TREVOR
Freeze buddy Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh Pchw
pchw Kapchew

Will just keeps running past him

TREVOR (CONTD)
Heyy slow down Will Yer not playing

Will stops and lets Trevor catch up

TREVOR (CONTD)
Damn yer fast Alright freeze
Down on the ground Hands behind
your head scumwad

But Will just grabs his toy gun and lifts it from his hands
TREVOR (CONTD)

No dummy Here youre gonna break
my gun
Will just looks down at his brother dumbly

TREVOR (CONTD)
Alright then youll never take
me alive pig

Trevor dashes off playing the fugitive now
WILL LAUGHS in glee bounding in pursuit

But no matter where Trevor runs Wills incredible size and
strength catch up to him at every turn

TREVOR (CONTD)
Hey no cheatin Hey Leggo

Trevor collapses to the ground exhausted

TREVOR (CONTD)
Geesh little brother you sure have
gotten fast Yer growing like a
weed

They stare out at the dark night sky There is A FAINT HAZE
OF LIGHT MARKING A TOWN far beyond the ridge

TREVOR (CONTD)
Now what I NEED to be doing instead
of sneaking out here with you is
sneaking down into town there Go
meet me some girls

WILL

TREVOR

Naw she aint down there

Trevor chews on a stalk of grass remembering

WILL
Well meet a niiice girl

TREVOR
WE Oh man I dont know about no
double-date Here bend down you
got some crap in your hair

Trevor picks some grass and twigs from his brothers hair
finding A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER

TREVOR (CONTD)
Whoa check it out buddy Four-
leaf clover

He holds it up against the moonlight showing it to Will
who holds it delicately but confused

Trevor plucks a regular clover to show him

TREVOR (CONTD)
See that ones different

WILL

TREVOR
Heh yeah guess so You gonna be
my good luck charm critter

Trevor CHUCKLES as Will studies the precious clover

TREVOR (CONTD)
Ahh cmon I got to get you back

gone

Will drags his feet PICKING THROUGH THE CLOVERS ON THE
GROUND looking for another four-leaf one

WILL
Are there more like meee
TREVOR
Brother there aint nothing quite

like you
We fly up from the long field to show the entire valley the

small farm houses and the QUIET EERIE STREETLIGHTS OF THAT
SMALL VALLEY TOWN in the distance

DISSOLVE TO
EXT GRISTLEWOOD MAIN STREET - MORNING
We float among this quiet small town
- Picket fences rose bushes

- A dogs tied up outside the TOWN DINER as a waitress brings
him out some bacon scraps

- THE CHURCHS STEEPLE BELL RINGS OUT

- A shopkeeper opens up the HARDWARE STORE unfurling his
American flag

A DELIVERY TRUCK is parked out front dropping off fertilizer

In the back of the store the TRUCK DRIVER ( 30s ) is stacking
bags of fertilizer The dust is flying everywhere and hes
got his shirt pulled up over his nose

As he stops to wipe his brow we hear a HACKING SNEEZING
COUGH from somewhere in the room The driver looks around

TRUCK DRIVER
Hello Somebody back there

He moves towards the sound it came from BEHIND THE BACK

WALL As he looks closer he notices a bunch of boards nailed
across a doorway One of them is loose he pulls it back

and peers into the darkness

After a tense moment a DEEP GUTTURAL BREATH He backs away
nervously

TRUCK DRIVER (CONTD)
What the hell

SUDDENLY A HAND IS LAID ON HIS SHOULDER

The truck driver spins around in fear to meet the tall
imposing figure of a GRIM COUNTRY SHERIFF

SHERIFF WILLIAM TUCKER (40s) a humorless man with a chiseled
face offers the truck driver a bitter stare

SHERIFF
Looking for something

TRUCK DRIVER
Uh no sir just just finishing
up

SHERIFF
Well dont let me keep you

OUTSIDE --

The truck driver takes his cue and hurries out to close up
his truck anxious to leave The Sheriff hovers at the door

Meanwhile a younger man stumbles out of the hardware store
with an armful of tools and lumber this is BOBBY RABEL (20s)

SHERIFF (CONTD)
Whats all the commotion

RABEL
Ahhh Betsys got me all kinds of
busy If we get that house wont
be a free minute without a hammer in
my hand

SHERIFF
Whose house you buying

RABEL

going to talk to him about it
tomorrow

The Sheriffs eyes go sharp at the mention of the name

0 SHERIFF
wens

The truck driver STARTS HIS ENGINE and nervously sneaks a
glance at the Sheriff whos still got his wicked scowl locked
on this outsider

SHERIFF (CONTD)
(lost in thought)

I havent seen Henry Owens in a long

time Tell you what Ill give ya

a ride out there

RABEL
Uh okay

SHERIFF
Itll be nice to check up on him

From the steely look in his eyes we can tell this visit
will be anything but nice

INT BARN —- DAY

Will is poking through the encyclopedias The DOOR CREAKS
and a shaft of light shines on him Its Paw

PAW
Hey

Will says nothing

PAW (CONTD)
Had a extra piece a pie here
thought you might

He sets it down in the middle of the barn then goes back to
the door

Will nudges at it cautiously his CHAINS RATTLING

PAW (CONTD)
Sorry its gotta be this way

Paw shuts and chains the door leaving Will in darkness
EXT OWENS FARM - LATER

Trevor is hanging from a fence dangling by his knees Upside-
down he sees the delivery truck driving up to the gate

TRUCK DRIVER
Hey you know where the Owens place
is

TREVOR
Youre looking at it here lemme
hop in its a hike back to the house

Trevor jumps in the truck
INT TRUCK CAB - CONTINUOUS

Trevor looks around the cab Theres some sexy ladies hanging
from the rear-view

Rolling across the dash is a little LIGHT-UP TRINKET-TOY
Trevor cant resist and presses the button It lights up
and TINGLES A LITTLE TUNE

TRUCK DRIVER
You like that My girl gave it to

TREVOR

TRUCK DRIVER

TREVOR

EXT OWENS FARM - DAY
The truck driver flings open the back roller door

TRUCK DRIVER

TREVOR

Paw appears from the house
PAW
Just drop it there Well move it
ourselves

They keep unloading the big pallet of feed bags while Paw
just stands watch

EXT OWENS FARM - LATER

The truck driver pulls the cargo door shut HE TOSSES THE
LIGHT-UP TOY-TRINKET TO TREVOR WITH A NOD

Trevor quickly hides the toy in his overalls

As the truck pulls off Trevor watches him go sadly then
stoops to pick up the feed bags Paw is just standing there

TREVOR
You gonna help or what

PAW
Whats the matter Cant handle it

Paw wanders off Trevor angrily throws the feed on his back
INT OWENS HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Another lonely microwave dinner at the Owens home Paws

draining beercans especially fast tonight ON THE TV A
GAMESHOW CONTESTANT IS WINNING A DREAM VACATION

TREVOR

INT OWENS HOUSE TREVORS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Trevor is flopped across his bed leafing through a worn-out
Sears catalog

PAW (CONT VO)
-- cause were all of us trapped out
here boy All of us

As the words echo through his mind he looks at a picturesque
IMAGE OF TWO BROTHERS on a colorful plastic playset Mom
and Dad look on lovingly behind them

We get a look around his room which is filled with country
knickknacks his dads POW-MIA flag arrowheads a shelf
full of antlers

He pulls the FOUR-LEAF CLOVER from his pocket and carefully
flattens it in-between the pages

A RAP AT THE DOOR and Trevor quickly tosses the catalog under
his bed

Paw sticks his head in looking to make amends for his
outburst at dinner

PAW (CONTD)

Hey sport
TREVOR
Hey
PAW
You uh sure you dont wanna watch

tv Cops is coming on

TREVOR
Naw Im tired

PAW
Yer gonna miss the hot pursuits

Trevor rolls over

TREVOR
Naw

PAW
Suit yerself

Paw hangs at the door for an awkward moment before finally
leaving

Trevor getsup and looks out from his bedroom window towards
the barn below

THERE IN THE UPPER HAYLOFT he can barely make out his poor

little brother playing with the BLINKING GREEN LIGHT-UP TOY-
TRINKET

DISSOLVE TO
INT BARN - MORNING

Trevor has a bandanna over his face Hes shoveling Wills
poop out the side door

TREVOR
Cant you even AIM for the hay

Will looks out at his brother sheepishly shielding his eyes
from the shafts of daylight creeping in the open door

WILL
Not feel well

TREVOR
Yea I should say so

Will is playing with the light-up toy

TREVOR (CONTD)
You know I cant get you no more
batteries once that thing runs out
dont ya

But Will just keeps on pressing the button gleefully until
his head perks up noticing something

WILL
Trevor

The sound of a CAR APPROACHING on the gravel road

Trevor dashes over to peer out the slats Will follows
anxiously

OUTSIDE -- Its a police prowler The Sheriff and Bobby
Rabel

Wills smooshing his fingers through the slats for a better
view

WILL (CONTD)
What is it

TREVOR
Shut up Theyre here early Go
hide back there Throw some hay
over yerself or something

From the barn we see Paw climb down the porch

Trevor silently pulls the door shut as he catches Paw giving
a quick glance to the barn

OUTSIDE --
The three men stand stock-still around the porch The Sheriff

stands rigid a smiling son-of-a-bitch as conniving as he
is cruel The baby faced Bobby Rabel louches next to him

PAW
Sheriff
SHERIFF
Owens Farm looks ‘bout how Id

PAW

PAW
I wasnt expecting a police escort

SHERIFF

RABEL

SHERIFF
Bobby and his young wife are expecting

PAW

family there kid

Paw and the Sheriff are locked in steely gazes Rabel is
clueless

RABEL
Hey I know the house is in bad shape
but you wouldn t have to do nothing

Paw goes to take a dip of chaw notices his bag is almost
empty

PAW
How much you thinking

Meanwhile the Sheriff surveys the horizon a cruel but
discerning eye Hes looking for something Henry Owens
and Bob Rabel continue their negotiations OFF—SCREEN

RABEL (0S)
Well its a small lot mind you
And its gonna need a ton of work

The Sheriff peers past the rickety porch examines a slop
trough buzzing with flies

IN THE BARN --
Trevor looks on nervously
PAW (0S)
Long as I dont have to go into town
for the papers
RABEL (0S)
Yes well Ill mail you the papers
but I couldnt find your address
anywhere
-- the Sheriff continues his gaze towards THE BARN now --

PAW (0S)
Thats cuz I aint got one

The Sheriff sees it a SLOW ZOOM ON THE BARNS HEAVY LOCK
INT BARN - CONTINUOUS

Trevor sees the Sheriff approaching He ducks away from th
door

TREVOR
Oh crap

Trevor runs to hide Will who is rustling around the barn
nervously

TREVOR (CONTD)
Will you gots to hide Quick-like

WILL
Treevvooor whats happening

Wills getting spooked knocking stuff over
TREVOR
No just just dont move a muscle
No matter what happens

We can hear the MUFFLED ARGUMENT of the approaching Sheriff
and Paw

Suddenly the door is ripped open by the Sheriff
Paw pushes past him but theres nothing to see The barn
is empty now Trevor and Will are nowhere to be seen

AW
I told you there’ s nothing there
Youre not even sheriff out here
(MORE )

e

PAW (CONTD)
The county line ends at my drive
and Im DAMN sure about that

The Sheriff draws his gun and steps carefully Sniffs the
air He turns the corner towards the stall

SUDDENLY TREVOR POPS OUT

The Sheriff aims his pistol in a flash only easing his
trigger-finger when he sees who it is

PAW (CONTD)
Christ Sheriff You damn near blew
my sons head off

TREVOR
Sorry Paw I I was just gettin
ready to start my chores

The Sheriff holsters his gun

SHERIFF
You Trevor right

TREVOR
Yessir

SHERIFF

Trevor looks to his dad nervously

PAW
What the hell difference does that
make

TREVOR

PAW

Cmon now Bill I got work to do
Why dont you take little Bobby Rabel
here home so he can get his papers
in order

RABEL
Yea Sheriff if you dont mind I
gots to go pick up Betsy

But the Sheriffs not giving up He sniffs the air and
steps deeper into the stalls

He steps on something under the hay that gives out a METAL
CLINK Everyone freezes

The Sheriff reaches down and finds a HEAVY RUSTY CHAIN hidden
under the hay

The Sheriff follows the metal links back to where it is bolted
fast to the wall A wicked glare to Paw who holds his poker
face as Trevor squirms under the tension

The Sheriff follows the chain back through the hay around
the corner when he sees it

WILL RISES FROM HIS HIDING PLACE a towering and bewildering
monster

SHERIFF
-Jesus H Christ
TREVOR
Will
PAW

Dammit Trevor

The Sheriff steps back in horror as Trevor runs to keep Will
in the corner

PAW (CONTD)
Now Sheriff dont get all half-cocked

RABEL
Jesus look at the size of that
thing
SHERIFF
Dammit Owens Has anyone ever seen
this
PAW

SHERIFF
You TOLD me youd dealt with this
thing when it was born

PAW
This is a family matter alright
And Im handling it my way

SHERIFF
And what if he gets loose What if
somebody finds him Then it comes
down on all of us You might not
give a shit about that anymore

PAW
You and your town are gonna have to
answer for things someday You know

SHERIFF
Nor you lied to me Owens Lied
right to my damn face while your
e was dying in the next room
You told me this thing was dead now

The Sheriff UNHOLSTERS ONE OF HIS PISTOLS and hands it to
Rabel who takes it uneasily

SHERIFF (CONTD)
Gimme a hand Rabel

RABEL
I dunno about this

PAW
HOLD ON You cant just do that

TREVOR
But he aint done nothing Hes no
more dangerous than you or me

SHERIFF
Speak for yourself

HE SHOVES TREVOR TO THE GROUND COCKING HIS GUN DEFINITIVELY

WILL SNAPS TO ATTENTION His eyes dont look so friendly
all of a sudden His chains goes TAUT

PAW
Dont you touch my boy You aint
gonna hurt either of them

SHERIFF
Thats the thing you never could
understand Owens That thing
there hes no kin to you --

The Sheriff draws a bead on Will who looks back with
sorrowful questioning eyes

SHERIFF (CONTD)
-- They aint no part of any of us

Trevor cowers protectively in front of his kid brother

Paw breaks in knocking the Sheriffs gun out of the way as
it FIRES WIDE EXPLODING IN A BEAM NEXT TO WILLS HEAD

THE GUNSHOT SENDS EVERYONE OVER THE EDGE Wills freaking
out Trevors trying to calm him down Rabel doesnt know
WHAT to do

Paw and the Sheriff are fumbling for the gun Theres a
brief struggle their eyes locked with years of pent-up
rivalry

PAW
Dammit you aint got the right

The men wrestle with the gun until the worst happens

POWWWWWW THE SHOT REVERBERATES THROUGH THE HOLLOW BARN
Henry Owens falls to the ground his blood quickly pooling

A moment of pure shock by EVERYONE there Even the Sheriff
cant quite believe what he just did Trevors stunned
Rabels speechless

-e-but not Will HES FURIOUS

His already-tense FISTS CLAMP DOWN hard as his now FIERY

EYES turn on the Sheriff WILL IS SEETHING WITH FURIOUS
RAGE Its the moment the Sheriff was afraid of This isnt
the sweet little brother weve known Wills become a
TERRIFYING BEAST

As Will stomps closer the Sheriff is rightly terrified He
stumbles back and in a fluster shoves Rabel towards the
freak

Rabel doesnt know what else to do he feebly raises his gun
at him

Will ROARS AND GRABS BOBBY RABEL BY THE GUN LIFTING HIS
ENTIRE BODY off the ground

WILL
RAAAAAARRRGH

He SWINGS RABEL AGAINST A BEAM POST like a RAG DOLL SMASHING
HIS SPINE

TREVOR
Will NO STOP DONT DO
IT

WILL SMASHES RABELS BODY TO THE GROUND before LUNGING FOR
THE SHERIFF who is trembling off a few errant pistol shots

Will leaps for the Sheriff but with a YANK hes HELD BACK
BY HIS CHAINS He struggles against them as the Sheriff
hastily reloads

Wills eyes are RED HIS MUSCLES BULGING WITH REVENGE FOR
THE ONLY FATHER HE EVER KNEW

The chains around Wills wrists are shaking ONE OF THE
LINKS IS BENDING

The Sheriffs still fumbling with his bullets

SHERIFF
Oh Christ

Will finally BREAKS THE CHAINS and SMASHES INTO THE SHERIFF

The Sheriffs body FLIES 50 FEET THROUGH THE AIR BREAKING
THROUGH THE BARN DOOR AND OUT INTO THE YARD

Trevors dashing around trying to calm down his brother who
is carelessly dragging around Rabels dead body

TREVOR
Will Stop it JUST STOP IT

Wills calming down but hes still uneasy and confused He
picks at his fathers limp hand Why isnt he moving

WILL
Paww

He keeps coming to Trevor but even with his broken chains
Will wont step into the light Scared to leave the barn

WILL (CONTD)
Trevor help Paw Trevvooor

TREVOR
Jesus Will

Trevor paces in shock But whatever happens now he knows
he has to help his brother He grabs Wills hand and pulls
him outside

TREVOR (CONTD)
Cmon you cant help him now

OUTSIDE --

The Sheriffs body is still on the ground where it landed
Hes not moving Trevor grimaces

TREVOR (CONTD)
Oh Jesus Cmon hurry up

They hurry across the yard Will is blinded by the sun

WILL
Briiight

Trevor pushes him on
INT OWENS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

They rush inside

TREVOR
Just just stay put for a second
I I gotta think

He runs upstairs
INSIDE PAWS BEDROOM --

The door rattles with a few kicks from Trevor and then bursts
open splintering the padlock

He grabs some cash from his dads dresser Picks up the
phone and looks OUT THE WINDOW --

IN THE DRIVEWAY THE SHERIFFS BODY IS GONE His squad car
door is hanging open

TREVOR (CONTD)
Shit whered he go

DOWNSTAIRS --

Will is shuffling around the house he never knew His eyes
curious at every little detail seeing the world for the
first time

WE HEAR A SCREENDOOR CREAK someones in the house now but
Will is oblivious to the impending threat

MORE FOOTSTEPS from the other room

The SOUND OF CLOSETS BEING OPENED Someones searching the
house but Wills still lost in his exploration of the room

The massive child finally settles on an old PHOTO OF THEIR
MOTHER hanging in the hallway We can tell that Will knows
who this is

As we move around him we suddenly see THE SHERIFF creeping
in behind him shotgun trembling in his hands

Will doesnt know hes there or if he does he doesnt care

The Sheriff looks over this freak with disgust He gets
ready to shoot when suddenly a CLICK from behind

ITS TREVOR HOLDING HIS DADS OLD REVOLVER ON THE SHERIFF

thinking

TREVOR (CONTD)
Oh no Will you cant jump it

THE OVERSIZED CHILD RUNS AND LEAPS WITH A HUGE STRIDE OVER
THE DEEP RAVINE AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT this massive figure
flying through the air Trevor slung over his shoulder

The Sheriff runs up drops his aim and then his jaw gazing
down at the large un-crossable gap

ON THE OTHER SIDE Will finally lands with THUD and the
massive boy carrying his brother disappears into the craggy
trees

TREVOR (CONTD)
Holy shit buddy you made it

The Sheriff throws the mic back into the cab pops the trunk
and pulls out an old gas can

It sloshes in rhythm as he carries it up to the farmhouse
face set with a grim determination

EXT WOODS - DAY

Will and Trevor are running through the forest along the
base of the foothills

The iron cuffs are still on Wills wrists and a couple links
still hang from them jingling as he runs

The sight is a punch to Trevors gut A black and thick column
of smoke rising behind them

WILL

EXT MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET

Trevor just shakes his head a little amazed He takes his
brothers hand and leads him deeper into the hills

EXT OWENS FARM - DUSK

Down on the farm a few of Sheriff Tuckers trusted good
ole boys from town arrive in a pick-up truck

The Sheriffs deputy LEE CARVER jumps out from behind
the wheel and runs up to the OWENS BARN WHICH IS COMPLETELY
ABLAZE

The Sheriff doesnt greet them but just stares into the
flames coldly

LEE CARVER

Sheriff what the hell happened here
SHERIFF

Rest of yall check out the woods

A glob of tobacco spit hits the ground

MR UNDERHILL climbs out of the passengers seat
gnawing on a plug of tobacco as he loads A HIGH-POWERED
HUNTING RIFLE

TWO HUNTING ATVS are rolled off the back of pickups

GUNS COCKED ENGINES REVVED

EXT RAVINE - NIGHT

MOTLEY HUNTING DOGS BARK wildly as an old man leads them to
the ravine edge that Will jumped over He shoves a tattered
piece of Wills blanket under their noses and they all barrel
down the embankment

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The HIGH-POWERED HEADLIGHTS of the ATVS pour across the trees
bouncing over the landscape

Underhill motions for the other hunters to fan out as the
HUNTING DOGS lead them on howling into the dark

AHEAD --

Trevor and Will race on through the jagged and claustrophobic
woods

BEHIND THEM --

The hunting dogs SNARL AND SNAP bounding after the boys in
a frenzy

EXT ROCKY CLIFF - NIGHT
Will and Trevor ascend the rocky path leading to the crest

They scramble over one of the large rocks but the dogs are
right on them

With a VICIOUS GROWL one of them LEAPS AT TREVOR biting
his pant leg and pulling him down

As Trevor tries to kick the dog off he keeps thrashing
TREVORS ABOUT TO GET PULLED DOWN THE ROCKY CLIFF

TREVOR
Just keep going

But suddenly Trevor and the dog are hoisted up Wills got

them both He pries the hound off his brother and hurls it
down the embankment where it lands with a YELP

More dogs leap at Will His massive arms swat off a few of
them

A couple dogs get past him SINKING THEIR TEETH INTO HIM
Will WAILS in Rage’ but his cry turns into a ROAR as he grabs
them with his huge hands hurling them all off The dogs
retreat whimpering into the woods with the tails between
their legs

Will breathes heavily from the fight his arms and regs still

bleeding Trevor looks at his brother with a newfound
respect

TREVOR (CONTD)
Will you saved me

WILL
Trevor saved ME first

VOICES in the distance The hunters are still coming
EXT WOODS - NIGHT
IN THE DISTANCE a few stark lightning bolts hit the horizon

The hunters prowl for our heroes as a late summer rain blows
in One of them stops finding a GIANT FOOTPRINT in the mud

HUNTER
Cmon this way Keep yer guns dry

As they move on we crane up a tree where TREVOR AND WILL
ARE CROUCHED AMONG THE BRANCHES

Trevor jerks his thumb in an upward motion Will nods and
together they climb to a higher nook where they settle in

As RAIN spreads Trevor and Will can hear the SOUNDS OF THE
POSSE fading through the trees

Wills child-like eyes dart to the HOWLING OF THE DOGS

WILL
Trevvoorr are we going home now
TREVOR
Naw critter We wont be going

TREVOR

Well have to keep moving

I aint gonna let them get a hold of

Trevor gazes out helplessly on the edge of panic and the
verge of tears This misshapen brother is all hes got left
now
A MUSICAL WHIZZING SOUND causes him to look back at his kid

brother Will has pulled his light-up toy from his dirty
pants pocket and is whirling it with an innocent toothy grin

Trevor snatches it from him worried about the sound

WILL
Am I in trooubble

Trevor rubs his eyes and leans on his brothers shoulder

TREVOR
You and me both buddy

They huddle close in the branches just the two of them
against the uneasy black night

when he comes upon A CHARRED HAND

LEE CARVER

LEAFY GREENS consuming the decayed ruins

Trevor peeks inside cautiously A cavernous space with
rooms and tunnels below the catwalks and machinery

Will helps him as Trevor climbs onto the roof
ON THE ROOF --
Trevor walks around assessing the place

A WRENNNCHHHHING SOUND and Trevor turns to see Will PEELING
BACK THE METAL ROOF WITH HIS INCREDIBLE STRENGTH

As Will climbs onto the roof to join his brother he shields
his unaccustomed eyes to the sunlight

EXT GAS STATION EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

An eerily quiet town street A dogs nosing around a fire
ant hill

Trevor shuffles in with his head down and his nerves high
Its a small little town gest a few intersecting streets
with a handful of shops and homes A RUSTY OLD WATER TOWER
and simple CHURCH STEEPLE rise above it all

A RUN-DOWN GAS STATION is the first thing he comes across
The BANGING OF METAL carries on the wind

Inside the garage an old man DOC GRAMPS is HAMMERING
AWAY on some twisted piece of engine

Trevor slinks going unnoticed as he eyeballs the scene

A SUDDEN ROAR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STATION Trevor spins
to see MILLER RHODES a fusion of redneck and rockabilly
astride a piece of shit dirtbike

Hes done gassing up and stuffs a five dollar bill in the
pumps handle

Miller Rhodes peels out in a trail of dust The old man
scurries out after him seeing the cash

DOC GRAMPS
That was more than five dollahs you
sonoffa bitch

Trevor keeps watching when suddenly VICIOUS BARKING right
behind him

He spins around to see several big HUNTING DOGS leaping
against a puny chain-link pen Trevor stumbles back Doc
Gramps sees Trevor at the last moment

DOC GRAMPS (CONTD)
What are ya doing to my dogs kid

Trevor ducks behind a nearby PARKED BIG RIG sneaking along
behind it

He keeps off the main road walking around peoples back
yards skirting behind the scattered shops and buildings
Eventually he comes upon

EXT TOWN - MAIN STREET

Gristlewoods main street and town square a dreary but tidy
little place

Trevor keeps tucked behind the shaded corner of a house
trying not to draw attention and watching main street to
see how bad this town really is

A few townsfolk go about their day The only sound is a
rusty weather vane squeaking in the breeze

Two old hags GOSSIP IN HUSHED TONES along the storefronts

CHIP a blonde-haired kid with dirty clothes wanders
past them and into a drugstore

A pickup truck cuts down the street heading out of town in
a hurry

As its dust settles Trevors eyes fall on a younger kid
SILAS with coke-bottle glasses and a quiet demeanor

He is sitting down in the road facing the sidewalk messing
with something in the storm drain

As Trevor looks closer he sees THE KIDS HANDS ARE COVERED
IN BLOOD He pulls out a large hunting knife and starts
hacking something up on the sidewalk

OLD LADY 1
Silas dont cut that there its
gonna stain

Silas gives her a blank stare then holds up A GASPING LIVE
FISH ITS HEAD HACKED HALF-OFF

The old biddy waves him off with a tisk as Trevor continues
on uneasily

INT OVERGROWN FACTORY - DAY

Meanwhile we find Will pondering a small lizard as it
scurries along the rusted girders

Will crouches and follows the lizard like a scent hound

He moves deeper into the factory past a peculiar pile of
dusty artificial flowers

His feet CRUNCH something small bones and rodent skulls are
littered between the silk petals

Will doesnt give any of that much thought though After
all the lizard is much more interesting

BUT THEN A CLANK something rattles some loose metal in
the shadows

A WHOOOSH of movement behind him Will turns around slowly
as the lizard escapes through a crack in the brickwork

Trevor that you
Another CLANG and A BLUR OF MOVEMENT

WILL (CONTD)
Treeevoor

Through a caved-in office wall Will sees a deer and its
fawn grazing off the tender new foliage that grows on the
factory floor

WILL (CONTD)
Ohhh prettyyy

He watches them peacefully for a moment then the doe sniffs
the air anxiously

SUDDENLY A DARK MONSTROSITY LEAPS onto the fawn taking it
down in a BLOODY VIOLENT MESS

Will ducks back from the hole scared out of his wits
WILL (CONTD)
(whimpering)
Nooooo

Will creeps away listening nervously to the TERRIFYING CHOMPS
of this creature eating

He hides behind the wall before mustering some courage and
risking another peek

A HIDEOUS FACE FLASHES IN FRONT OF HIM part boy and part
animal WEARING THE TORN RAGS OF AN OLD SHIRT

IT SNARLS AT WILL ALL BLOODY FUR AND JAGGED TEETH

WILL (CONTD)
AHHHHHHH

WILL YELPS IN FEAR and the creature dashes back into the
dark maintenance tunnels of the factory

Will looks around in a panic then BOLTS for the front door
looking for his brother

Outside a wind rustles the leaves a front blows in across
the valley as we cut back to

EXT TOWN - LATER

Trevor wanders through an older and quieter part of town as
the same wind rustles the trees

Tucked away on an overgrown lot he sees something that stops
him dead in his tracks we reveal

The name OWENS PAINTED ON A ROTTING MAILBOX Behind

which sits a decrepit boarded-up house Now only a remnant
of the family that was

INT ABANDONED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Trevors almost reverent as he slips in through a broken
window wiggling inside and remembering the house he
left so long ago

Not much is left but dust and empty decay

As he creeps down a hallway we MATCH CUT TO

FLASHBACK --

THE SAME HALLWAY SEVEN YEARS AGO as seen through a red
DREAM-LIKE HAZE of memory

A WOMAN is CRYING SCREAMING his mother

A vision of Paw in the dark hallway his hands are covered
with blood

A knocking and a silhouette at the front door its the
Sheriff Paw argues with him in the hallway leaving Trevor
to inch closer to mothers room

A glimpse through the door reveals mother lying there eyes
open not moving Shes dead

At the door the Sheriff and Paw are fiercely arguing Its
not until Paw holds up his bloodied hands that the sheriff
nods solemnly and moves on to the next house

Paw runs into the bedroom and grabs the bundle of bloody
clothes shoving it into Trevors arms

PAW
Hide him

Trevor looks down and meets the GROTESQUE WRIGGLING FORM OF
A NEWBORN WILL He takes his tiny brother in his arms when
a GUNSHOT rings out

Trevor turns to the bedroom window Next door ANOTHER
MUZZLEFLASH behind the neighbors curtains Trevor jumps
scared and confused

Behind him Paw rips open a closet and pulls out a suitcase

in a hurry He yanks some clothes off the hanger a lacy
dress remains swinging alone in the closet

BACK IN PRESENT DAY --

WE DISSOLVE TO THE SAME CLOSET with Trevor standing in front
of it

The same dress is now faded and moth-eaten He reaches out
and touches the lace sewn onto the arms of the dress

TREVOR
This musta been moms

He leans forward as if to sniff it when

From outside A CAR DOOR IS SLAMMED

Trevor scrambles to peer through yellowed old curtains
PARKED OUTSIDE --

ITS THE SHERIFF He proceeds to slowly climb the porch
steps and push open the front door

SHERIFF
Helloooo

He takes a look around scanning the rooms on the chance
that perhaps Trevor has come here

But THE DUSTY ROOM IS EMPTY Trevors nowhere to be seen
Sheriff Tuckers right hand never strays too far from his

holster The stairs CREAK as he ascends them to check out
the bedrooms

UNDER HIS BOOTS we see Trevor hidden crouching in a small
cubby under the stairs holding his breath

A CRACK and one of the stairs gives out Trevor is frozen

light pours in through the broken stair The Sheriffs foot
is caught in it

SHERIFF (CONTD)
Arrh to hell with this

He pulls his boot out of the stairs and returns to the front
door A moment later we hear the DOOR SLAM and his car
speed away

Trevor lets out a sigh of relief then looks down and sees
something amongst the debris

Jesse just takes a long sip from his soda using a twizzler
as his straw

JESSE

A CRASH in the other aisle She steps out from behind the
counter and stands at the endcap watching Trevor

He stumbles through assessing his armful of Fritos candy
bars and bandages He hurries to the end aisle almost
bumping into her dropping some stuff

MAGGIE (CONTD)
In an awful hurry with those spicy
hot pork rinds arent you

Trevor looks up surprised and smitten at first sight

TREVOR
Huh Oh well you know

He awkwardly turns and pretends to be interested in dishwasher
detergent

MAGGIE
Do I know you

TREVOR

Chip bounces the ball against the window again Jesse jumps
up and runs outside after his pal

But as Jesse runs out he bumps into GARRETT TUCKER a
handsome dark-haired boy who brushes him off with a laid-
back haughtiness

GARRETT
Watch it

JESSE
Hey Chip you ever seen what a nuclear
bomb does to an ant

Outside the two kids chase each other down the street
Garrett just swaggers up to the counter

GARRETT
Anybody work ‘round here

Maggie pops around the aisle and greets him with a half-forced
smi

MAGGIE
Look who it is

Garrett steps up and tries to greet her a little too
affectionately She nimbly dodges his grope and darts behind
the counter

MAGGIE (CONTD

coffee this morning

GARRETT
Old mans gone piss-aped Been gone

Trevor hands her the crumpled bill They lock eyes and she
gives him his change along with a small wry smile

MAGGIE (CONTD)

TREVOR
Err better save them

Garrett hovers next to them fishing a pickled egg out of a
jar

GARRETT

He reaches into Trevors bag and cracks off a coke from his
six pack taking a long sip

MAGGIE
Garrett You are paying for that

GARRETT
Naw its from my new buddy here
Senor Shitstain

He sneers like the spoiled kid he is before digging into his
pickled egg Maggie shoots Trevor an apologetic look as she
swats at Garrett

MAGGIE
Just go grab another
(to Garrett)
I am gonna sock you one Stop being
such an ass

As Trevor goes for another six-pack he watches Maggie lecture
the jerk She certainly has spunk

OUTSIDE THE STORE WINDOW --

A CAR HORN catches everyones attention The SHERIFFS CAR
PULLS UP honking at Chip and Jesse who are playing in the
street

OH SHIT Trevor ducks behind the aisle out of sight

GARRETT
Hey Dad hold up

Garrett runs out to yell something to his dad Trevor leans
from behind the rack to get a look

OUTSIDE Sheriff Tucker mutters something to his son that we

He gets the drift and hurries into the back giving her a
quick and gracious wave

IN THE BACK HALLWAY --

Trevor creeps down the dark hallway looking for the way
out He comes to a thick heavy door to the storeroom Its
cracked open

Trevor slowly pushes his way in

hurries down the street and BUMPS INTO SILAS whos now

carrying a whole bucket of fish heads Silas just gives him
a funny look and continues on

Trevor keeps going but turns back to watch the kid unlock a
THICK CHAIN ON A CELLAR DOOR He tosses the bucket of slop
down into the darkness then locks it back up tightly
Trevors fed his brother enough to know whats going on here

Garrett bursts out of the back door Trevor disappears around
the corner just in time

Garrett looks around Just sees Silas

GARRETT
You see anybody else out here

Silas just shrugs with a vacant look

EXT TOWN BACKYARD - DAY

Trevor cuts through a backyard Sheets are drying on a
clothesline and he stays behind them crouching against the
side of the house

He hides tensely as Garrett runs past him searching the
back yards He waits until the coast is clear listening
carefully

But instead of Garrett he hears a RASPY BREATHING CLOSE
BEHIND HIM He turns and pulls back the billowing sheets

Through the loose slats of a boarded up window THE BLOODSHOT

slowly then bursts into a run heading back to the hills

They pull out TWO BULKY TWIN FREAKS They may just be kids
but those two are STRONG

Trevor cant believe his eyes when he sees what the farmers
are doing THEYRE HOOKING THE FREAKS INTO A PLOW The
men push them on tilling dead soil UNDER THE COVER OF NIGHT

Suddenly HEADLIGHTS TREVOR DIVES INTO THE TALL FIELDS
just as a PICK-UP TRUCK creeps by

Its the SHERIFFS POSSE piled in the back cruising the
back roads for any sign of Trevor or Will They skid to a
stop right next to where Trevors hiding in the tall fields

Lee Carver jumps out and runs over to the plow boys

Will tears into the food curiously tearing it in pieces and
mashing it in his mouth

out of the hole Will tore in the ceiling

Miller ROARS OFF on his motorcycle

Nobodys laughing now The Sheriff takes a last angry drag
on his cigarette and stomps it out

EXT WOODS - DAY

Trevor is making his way back slowly carrying the bag of
food while he munches on a candy bar

A THICK FOG rolls through the forest silently

A RUSH beside Trevor and he freezes in his tracks Trevor
pockets his candy bar and continues on walking a little
aster now

A SNARL from the leaves at his feet and Trevor catches a
FLASH OF DARK MOVEMENT

Trevor dashes on ahead as we catch FURTIVE GLIMPSES OF THE
FERAL FREAK that is slowly circling him

INT OVERGROWN FACTORY - DAY
Trevor rushes inside glancing back at the woods

TREVOR
Will Its me

Trevor looks around the shaded stained factory No sign of
Will

TREVOR (CONTD)
Will You here WILL

Some sheetmetal CREAKS as something leaps through a hole in
the wall a dark monstrous blur disappearing into the jumble
of machinery

Trevors spinning around now hes really scared

a TREVOR (CONTD)
Will

Hes answered by a STRANGE CHITTERING GROWL hardly human
and like no animal youve ever heard Its creeping around
Trevors shaking in his boots

Suddenly WHOOOSHH the feral beast leaps right past him
Trevor SCREAMS drops his stuff AND RUNS FOR IT

He sprints across the factory floor the FERAL FURRY MONSTER
LEAPING ACROSS THE CATWALKS RIGHT BEHIND HIM

Trevor spots an old production line trough with rollers down
the whole way HE LEAPS ON IT SLIDING DOWN TO THE LOWER
LEVELS OF THE FACTORY

He tumbles out at the end and hides breathing heavy as the
monster scampers down a nearby elevator shaft

We can hear the SNARLING creature sniffing around the dark
corridors Trevor inches along just hoping this thing
doesnt find him

Trevor notices a DARK RED BLOOD STAIN splattered on the
walls DRAGGED ACROSS THE FLOOR

He GULPS and inches on following this trail of gore He
finally comes upon it THE MUTILATED REMAINS OF A DEER

He covers his mouth in disgust and backs through another
door

INT OVERGROWN FACTORY BASEMENT

Trevor backs into the deepest levels of this creepy place
Large ROOTS have burst through the walls and boilers

Trevor inches along finally noticing a little corner

He leans closer scattered about are old newspa er birth
notices Weird simple drawings etched on the wal Childish
mementos hoarded in the corner A dingy stained Cabbage

Patch Doll Trevor looks around this disturbing lair

When he finally turns and COMES FACE TO FACE WITH THE FERAL
BEAST

Trevor RUNS FOR IT the WILD CREATURE right behind him
Its getting closer The feral freak LEAPS at Trevor and
WHAMM

THE MONSTROUS FORM OF THE FERAL FREAK POUNCES on him pinning
him to the floor DIRTY FUR FLYING AND HIS CLAWS BARED

TREVOR
AHHH GET OFF ME

Suddenly the creature is GRABBED BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK
AND PULLED OFF

TREVOR
Jesus Will What are you doing
What in what in the hell is that

WILL

(to the feral freak)
Now STOP This is my brother Trevor

Will sets the feral freak down He becomes much more calm
like a curious skittish animal

But this isnt an animal at all just a strange freak like
Will who looks more like a badger than a boy A boy we will
soon get to know as HANK (7

Trevor looks over the creatures threadbare clothes uneasily

TREVOR
Yea Im you re friend Dont

Trevor digs the candy bar out of his pocket and breaks off a
piece for him holding it out for him to sniff

TREVOR (CONTD)
Can he talk

WILL
He doesnt talk out loud He was
left out here

Hank leaps and nabs the rest of the candy bar from Trevors
hand then disappears into the vents under the factory

TREVOR
What the hell how many of these
kids ARE there

Trevor peers down the darkened grate seeing nothing in
the pitch blackness

WILL
Can we take him with us in the car

The guys follow him with their flashlights as GARRETT KEEPS
FIRING at the strange looking creature as it disappears out

Garrett jumps onto his ATV and is hot on Hanks tail Tate
hops on the back with Robby and they follow behind

EXT WOODS - MOVING

As the ATV headlights dance across the twisted foliage
Garrett can catch glimpses of Hank dashing through the
underbrush

He FIRES HIS PISTOL but Hank is zipping safely between the
dense trees

Garrett guns his ATV cutting through overgrown paths as
Hank zips around from tree to tree

WITH TREVOR AND WILL --

Will is bounding through the woods with remarkable speed
Trevor perched on his shoulder

TREVOR
Now whatever happens dont get too

BACK WITH THE ATVS --

Hank springs through the undergrowth and the ATVs plow on
after him

Garrett pulls alongside Hank and FIRES HIS PISTOL
Hank disappears with a YELP

He s still cruising along He looks back grinning to his
oys

GARRETT
I I think I got it

Then FROM ABOVE HANK LEAPS OUT WITH A SCREECH He drops
onto the back of Garretts fast-moving ATV

He swerves and bounces the machine throwing Hank off but
the feral child takes a VICIOUS SLASH across Garretts
handsome face

GARRETT (CONTD)

He skids to a stop The other boys pull up beside him

TATE

yet another direction

HUGE TREE

TREVOR (CONTD)

starts to uproot from the ground

WITH THE ATVS --

Garrett is focused on the path ahead tearing between the
trees

GARRETT

TATE

THE HUGE TREE TOPPLES INTO THEIR PATH

In the lead GARRETT SKIDS INTO A CRASH FLYING OVER THE
HANDLEBARS and busting up his front lights

ROBBY

Garrett picks himself up off the ground in a fury He whips
out his pistol ready to make someone pay

TATE
Damn did you see that Thing just
came down on its own

Garrett mops the blood off his face with his sleeve

GARRETT
Bullshit keep your eyes up

TATE
Man yer dads ATV got messed up

As Garrett stomps through the gully we see TREVOR AND WILL
crouched behind a big rotten stump

ROBBY (0S)

see a thing

A FLICK OF MOVEMENT someones sitting in the darkness across
the street

The eerie green indiglo of an outdoorsmans watch faintly
ILLUMINATES HIS STERN FACE ITS MR UNDERHILL

TREVOR

Hank pauses for a moment as Garrett walks outside and joins
Underhill

all the new sights in town

TREVOR (CONTD)

Trevor leads them on through some back streets

EXT CLAGUE GENERAL STORE - NIGHT

Trevor Maggie and the two freaks creep down the alley to
the general stores backdoor

Maggie digs through her pocket for the keys and unlocks the
door while Trevor keeps a look-out

Behind them A LOUD CRASH they all turn to see Hank has
overtured a trash can and is poking through it He looks up
at them innocently with coffee grounds all over his whiskers

A LIGHT IS SWITCHED ON IN THE CLAGUE HOUSE behind the store

BO CLAGUE (0S)

Maggie peeks around the corner to see her dad coming their
way

MAGGIE

TREVOR

overhear her father

BO CLAGUE (0S)

Trevors dumbstruck grin fades as he watches her go then
herds Will and Hank into the store

WEIRD HOMEMADE SECRET DOOR

Beneath it A GRIMY STONE STAIRCASE that leads to a dusty
BASEMENT

WILL
Down here
TREVOR
(a ‘no-shit look)

Ya think

Trevor grabs a nearby flashlight and steps cautiously down
into the creepy passage

INT CLAGUES SECRET BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

This is a weird old basement passage with slimy stones and
obscured nooks that could be hiding anything

Trevor spots a set of RUSTY OLD SHACKLES and shudders

They finally turn the corner and come into a larger room
The slowly move the spotlight around until the stark light
falls on the pale sickly back of ROY CLAGUE

Trevor slowly inches up to the cowering shivering freak

He reaches out his trembling hand slowly slowly and
touches Roys shoulder

ROY SPINS AROUND IN A FLASH and unleashes a horrible SCREECH
leaping across the basement cowering away

TREVOR
Shh Hold on We aint here to
hurt you
Roy runs around in fear until Will approaches him gently

WILL
Frieend

Roy slowly looks up shielding his eyes from the bright
flashlight

ROY

Will steps up and grabs the sideboard RIPPING IT OFF
REVEALING A DARK CRAWLSPACE UNDERNEATH Hank sniffs
furiously

TREVOR
No Will STOP Theres nothing under
there

Trevor leans down when A LONG ARM GROPES OUT FROM BETWEEN
THE BOARDS They all jump back in fright

The freak arm flails around madly eventually TEARING OPEN
THE BOARDS AND BURSTING THROUGH THEM IN A FRENZY The freak
cant get far though as a thick chain pulls taut at his
ankle and he struggles against it like a mad dog

The owner of this house Mr Wallace comes out with a
flashlight and a rifle

WALLACE
What the hell

TREVOR
Go go go

Wallace FIRES OFF A SHOT scaring his own freak back under
the house

As Wallace reloads Trevor grabs Roy and pushes Will around
the corner They run through gardens and duck between sheds

Theyre almost cornered when --

A STATION WAGON SKIDS up between them and Wallace The fast-
moving wagon FISHTAILS AROUND

LOUDLY Hank leaps off scared Miller runs over to shoo
him away

- Maggie rests her head on Trevors shoulder a blanket around
them both

- Will is turning the pages of his new encyclopedia volume
pointing out some of the pictures to Hank who in turn nibbles
at his fur every now and then

into the airstream to escape the cold night

- Maggie looks around for Roy who is over at their mothers
grave Hes been using a blackened stick to draw flowers on
her headstone She is surprised and touched at what her
brother is capable of

- Inside the cramped airstream the kids are all asleep on
top of each other Miller and Hank are passed out snuggling
in a beanbag chair watching a cabinet style tv

Trevor looks at them free like this He smiles but
somethings weighing heavily on his mind as he stares out
across the valley

its a moment of rest before the storm that Trevor knows
theyll never be able to avoid no matter how far they run

LARGE STACK OF WOODEN PALLETS and trash

He quickly scrambles up the wobbling stack

He leaps for the roof of the store the jumble of wood
toppling out from under his feet

Trevor dangles on the lip of the hardware store but pulls
himself over

He crouches down as he peers over the side looking for the
Sheriff

BELOW HIM IN THE ALLEY --

The Sheriff emerges right behind him seething He looks
around wildly

freak Im gonna save him for last
When out of the night we hear an ENGINE ROAR

The Sheriff turns just in time to see MILLER RHODES RACING
IN ON HIS DIRTBIKE HANK RIDING ON THE BACK

THE SHARP-CLAWED FREAK LEAPS FROM THE MOVING BIKE knocking
the Sheriff off Trevor and tearing into him with full claws

Miller rides straight for Lee Carver Lee doesnt know what
to do He moves the gun from Will to Miller

Miller doesnt slow down a second he just POPS A WHEELIE
AND PLOWS HIS ENTIRE BIKE INTO LEE CARVERS FACE

He flies over the handlebars landing with a roll leaving
Lee Carver smashed on the ground

Miller scrambles to his feet and runs off around the corner

MILLER RHODES
Trevor Get the hell outta here

With only a moment to spare the Sheriff throws Hank off
pulls his pistol and FIRES A SINGLE SHOT

HANK UNDERHILL COLLAPSES AND DIES

TREVOR
No You bastard

Trevor and Will look on they cant believe Hanks dead

Wills eyes go dark His muscles tense His fists clench
in rage

TREVOR (CONTD)
Will we cant help him now
Will WILL

WILL GOES ABSOLUTELY BALLISTIC

The bloodied Sheriff stumbles to his feet firing a couple
bullets into Wills shoulders BUT IT DOESN T EVEN PHASE THE
ENORMOUS FREAK

Will smashes a utility pole with the back of his fists as if
it were nothing

WILL
RAAAAAAARRRH

The utility pole falls over and CRACKLING POWER CABLES DANCE
ABOUT IN THE STREET

The Sheriff flees terrified He ducks around the corner
and arrives at his police prowler keys shaking as he unlocks
the door

He gets in and starts it when suddenly A SMASH THROUGH
THE REAR WINDOW Will MERCILESSLY POUNDS THE POLICE PROWLER

The Sheriff covers his head as Wills massive arms crush the
car around him

He barely manages to crawl out the passengers side But he
aint getting away that easy

WILL PICKS UP ONE SIDE OF THE CAR AND JUST TOSSES IT end
over end flying through the air at the Sheriff

The Sheriff hugs the ground as the car flies overhead --

-- soaring across the lot and TAKING OUT ONE OF THE LEGS OF
THE OLD RUSTY WATER TOWER

Will ROARS as he carelessly brings his fist down on a postal
box squishing it whole Trevor catches up to him

TREVOR
Willll Stooopp

Will paces like an animal HUFFING and PUFFING
TREVOR (CONTD
Just just cool down buddy
Cmon cmon Will Come with me

Will and Trevor bolt as the Sheriff cowers and THE WATER
TOWER SWAYS WITH A LOUD CREAK

We cut around town as everyone sees the water tower falter
They all watch helplessly

THE RUSTED WATER TOWER SLOWLY FALLS AND BUCKLES LANDING
WITH AN ENORMOUS CRASH

EXT MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
We catch up with Underhill and Bo running down the street
BO CLAGUE
Lord what the hell is going on in
this town

UNDERHILL
Over here

Hes come upon Lee Carver whos coughing up blood on the
street

LEE CARVER
They got me But Sheriff nailed one

of “em Shot the ugly sonnofa bitch
point blank

Carver points over to the dead body of Hank Underhill which
still lies where the Sheriff shot him

Underhill looks silently and somberly over his dead son
EXT GAS STATION EDGE OF TOWN - NIGHT

Miller runs up to Maggie carrying a case of booze under one
arm and a portable tv under the other

MAGGIE

MILLER RHODES

Then she sees it Trevor and Will limping up to the gas
station She runs up and throws her arms around Trevor

MAGGIE (CONTD)

A GUNSHOT ECHOES DOWN MAINSTREET They turn to see THE
SHERIFFS LURCHING TOWARDS THEM holding his wounds

He gives the Sheriff the tiniest of winks

MILLER RHODES (CONTD)

BLAM The shot happens before we realize it Millers

body slowly ripples back from the impact

The Sheriff holds his smoking pistol calmly He just blew
Rhodes away like it was nothing

TREVOR

Lee Carver and Underhill run around the corner followed by
Bo Clague and a few more men from town

She and the rest of the towns normal kids gather around

More townsfolk are making their way out on the street to see
this sight Garrett breaks away from the group and runs up

GARRETT

SHERIFF

He draws a bead on Trevor

SHERIFF (CONTD)

BLAMMM Trevor winces but hes fine

The Sheriffs face goes slack and his body falls to the
ground DEAD

Behind him ITS UNDERHILL still aiming his rifle at the
Sheriff

UNDERHILL
Shouldnt be pointing no gun at a
buncha kids
Garrett looks on stunned

GARRETT
Dad no

Doc Gramps takes him by the shoulder and leads him off

The rest of the townsfolk file out of the church to see this
tragic scene

So they stand there hushed

A line of silent eyes between parents and children These
simple farm folk and their long-abused freaks

Bo Glague approaches Maggie and tries to take her hand She
pulls back She wont budge

MAGGIE
Things have gotta be different from
now on dad
Bo lowers his head in agreement

WILL
Different like meee

Trevor reaches out and takes his brothers hand

Andso each adult walks slowly cautiously up to their
children both normal and freak

Mr Underhill meanwhile leaves the scene

He picks up the body of his dead son Hank and carries him
off into the quiet night

DISSOLVE TO
EXT OWENS NEW HOUSE - DAY
The old abandoned Owens house in town is seeing a new life
Maggie and Roy are repainting the OWENS name on the mailbox

The long-limbed girl grabs a piece of lumber and scurries up
the outside of the building

She hands it off to Will who is straddling the roof He
holds the lumber in place while Trevor hammers it in

As they finish with that board Will wipes his brow and
stretches out proud and tall after years of slouching

He looks up at the glorious sun beating down on them all

WILL
Bright

TREVOR
Yea buddy Get used to it

The two brothers exchange hard-won smiles

THE END
