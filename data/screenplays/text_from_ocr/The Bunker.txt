“THE BUNKER”

PROLOGUE
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM - JUNE 1944

An unfinished section of tunnel carved through bare earth
braced with pit-props and shored with timber Rubble and
wood and construction equipment are scattered around

Dim work-lights are strung along the roof but barely
illuminate the scene An emergency generator CLATTERS away
somewhere in the bg

At the junction of a dark side-tunnel two Organisation Todt
guards -- a SERGEANT and a CORPORAL -- are working furiously
HAMMERING huge lengths of timber across the mouth of the side-
tunnel gradually sealing it off

Their noses and mouths are masked against the dust by grimy
cotton scarves but their unease is plain to see

As they continue working an OT PRIVATE emerges from the
gloom of the main tunnel jogging towards them He slows to
a halt as he joins his two comrades and begins to quickly
fill them in

PRIVATE
That’s the last of them Everybody
else is out

The Sergeant glances around at the Private but doesn’t stop
working

SERGEANT
Put a face mask on you idiot

But the young Private seems impatient and cavalier He
ignores the comment and simply wipes the sweat from his neck
gesturing curiously at the side-tunnel

PRIVATE
Look when do we find out the big
secret Whats the panic Whatre
we supposed to be afraid of

The other two exchange a glance

CORPORAL
Never you mind Just give us a
hand to finish up Quick

The Private joins in reluctantly and they hoist another
thick plank into place holding it in position while the
Corporal HAMMERS a nail through one end

A CREAK -- and dust begins to spill from the roof The
Corporal carries on regardless NAILING the other end

But the Private is still inquisitive
PRIVATE
Nobody out there’s got a clue
what’s going on Why’re we doing
this
SERGEANT
Because weve been ordered to
Isnt that enough for you

Another plank is lifted into place and the barricade is
nearing completion

then the distant CLATTER of the generator falters

The lights dim -- then brighten again as the generator
returns to its previous steady rhythm

The two NCOs FREEZE -- holding their breath -- looking at
each other with speechless expectation

The generator SPLUTTERS again -- terminally this time
They let go of the plank and it CRASHES to the floor

Scrabbling for their torches starting to panic The Private
watching bemused as the other two CURSE under their breath

The Generator NOISE is now on a rapid downward curve slowing
and dying The lights are going with it

» and a solid shocking blackness drops on them with sudden
SILENCE

Their torches are on but the beams are feeble struggling to
penetrate the darkness The Sergeant cant help himself

SERGEANT (contd)
Oh Christ

His voice ECHOES away into the darkness
PRIVATE
The generator’s just out of petrol

Whats so --

CORPORAL
Shhh

A pause

then from the side-tunnel comes a new noise A faint
SCUFFLING sound

They automatically shine their torches at the barricade
their fear tangible now -- affecting even the young Private
whose cocky expression of disdain is rapidly dropping from
his face The Sergeant’s voice is tight

SERGEANT
Its happening Just like they
said

PRIVATE

What is it Is someone in there

But the other two are already backing away along the tunnel
in horrified disbelief

The Private begins to follow after them his nervousness
growing by the second the SCUFFLING getting LOUDER

PRIVATE (contd)
For Gods sake what is it Whats
in there
But the other two turn and RUN
- LOUDER STILL
And as his composure finally crumbles and he RUNS after them
the Private looks BACK over his shoulder one last time -- his
face now betraying an expression of sheer terror
CUT TO BLACK
FRONT TITLES
FADE IN
EXT FOREST - GERMAN BORDER DECEMBER 1944 - DAY

Densely packed pine trees in all directions Snowflakes
flutter down silently from a steel-grey sky

A German Army supply lorry crawls along a dirt road which
winds through the forest engine racing and wheels spinning
as it slithers through the river of mud churned up by a
hundred tanks and vehicles long gone

Accompanying it are a score of infantry breath pluming in
the frosty air Some trudge alongside the lorry offering a
shoulder occasionally to straighten it as it fishtails
through the slush The remainder follow twenty yards behind

Each is sagging under the weight of helmet equipment and
sodden greatcoat

Their uniforms mark them as regular army -- but their coats
carry the black and silver cuff-bands of an ‘elite’ division

ENGELS heading up the group of stragglers reaches into his
bread-bag and pulls out a half-eaten bar of chocolate He
pops a piece into his mouth and chomps it wearily

Following in his wake are EBERT SCHENKE KREUZMANN BAUMANN
HEYDRICH unit medic FRANKE and CO LT KRUPP We’1ll get
to know each of them soon enough Two or three others make
up the numbers -- but our group of eight are the main players
for now

ENGELS
They’1l be heading on to Brussels
without us at this rate

Ebert moving with a lithe cat-like alertness despite his
tiredness throws Engels an idle sideways glance

EBERT
What’s your hurry

SCHENKE
(a snort butting in)
Well it’s not to win any medals
that’s for sure

Engels ignores Schenke’s comment and responds to Ebert’s
question

ENGELS
What’s the hurry Have a guess

EBERT
(bored)
The women

ENGELS
God no They’re like French women
- coarse hair and wide-pored skin
Next guess

Heydrich -- older than the rest a veteran -- chips in

HEYDRICH
Surely not the booze

ENGELS
(shaking head)
Nah Cat’s piss all of it
(to them all)
Any more

Engels looks around -- but nobody else is interested except
Kreuzmann who is looking to him eagerly for the answer
Engels glances around once more then sighs in defeat
ENGELS (cont‘d)
Only two good things ever came out
of Belgium one’s the road to
Germany and the other

Engels snaps off a chunk of chocolate and tosses it back to
Kreuzmann with a wink and a warm smile Kreuzmann quickly
tears off the remaining wrapper with nervy fingers

KREUZMANN
Chocolate

Engels cocks his head appreciatively

ENGELS
Got it You can say what you like
but they make damned good --

A bullet SMACKS into Engels’ throat blowing a chunk out of
his neck as it exits The distant RIFLE SHOT follows a
second behind

Almost simultaneously a demolition charge EXPLODES under the
lorry ahead taking the legs off the accompanying troops

The front end of the vehicle HEAVES into the air and CRASHES
back down in a smoking ruin

The group SCATTER as a hail of SNIPER FIRE rains down

Heydrich catches a bullet in the leg and he and Ebert head
forward and left off the road Baumann takes a gully several
yard back also to the left Schenke Kreuzmann Krupp and
Franke dive right The rest take cover as best they can

Engels paralysed drops to his knees in the mud Hands at
his throat stemming the stream of blood Jaw working to
speak but only producing GURGLES He’s HIT again in the
shoulder but still remains upright

KREUZMANN
(a scream)
Get him out of there
But all attention is focussed forward as the rest of the unit
swing into action in unison settling behind cover to return
FIRE with well-practised precision With bullets SPITTING
down all around it’s all they can do to stay put

- while their legless dying comrades SCREAM in the bg

HEYDRICH and EBERT

snuggle into cover across the road Heydrich dragging his
injured leg painfully

Shock and confusion showing on their pale faces
EBERT
How bad’s the leg

Heydrich simply shakes his head more concerned about Engels
who’s still propped up on his knees in the kill-zone

HEYDRICH
We need to give Engels some
covering fire - see if someone can
get to him

EBERT
Angle’s wrong from here Sniper-
fire’s coming from up left

somewhere
HEYDRICH
What about retreating to that gully
back there
Someone BURSTS through the bushes suddenly behind them -- and

their guns are half turned in response before they realise
it’s Baumann

BAUMANN
We’ve got to move They’re coming
up from behind

Ebert looks around alert

EBERT
I don’t see any --
BAUMANN
I tell you they’re coming It’s a
trap
Heydrich and Ebert cast a concerned glance over at their
stricken comrade -- then Ebert makes a hasty decision
EBERT

Alright Let’s find cover forward

They jump to it and move forward through the trees rifles
pointed in readiness Heydrich limping along as best he can

But they’ve barely gone ten yards before a MACHINE GUN open
up from somewhere front right bullets CHOPPING into the tree
trunks all around them -- forcing them back

EBERT (contd)
Shit

Baumann and Ebert run for cover -- but Heydrich trips

As bullets KICK into the snow around him Heydrich SHOUTS for
help involuntarily
ENGELS

Slumped in the kill-zone Engels is on automatic pilot
Despite his appalling injuries his free hand struggles to
open the flap on his holster to get to his P38

He just manages it when two more bullets CHOP into him
smashing into arm and abdomen

He slumps back on his haunches with a gurgled MOAN -- but
miraculously still stays upright

KREUZMANN SCHENKE KRUPP AND FRANKE

huddle deeper behind cover as a sustained FUSILLADE of shots
rains down upon them suddenly

SCHENKE
Christ

Kreuzmann is making no attempt to return fire simply staring
impotently at Engels who has somehow summoned the strength
to shuffle around towards them vainly trying to inch his way
to cover

Franke meanwhile -- his helmet bearing the red cross of a
field medic -- averts his eyes so as not to look upon the man
he cannot help

Lieutenant Krupp is looking around for options

KRUPP
We’re dead if we stay here
(a shout)

Heydrich Baumann
No reply

SCHENKE
Where are they

The sniper fire abates momentarily But then something
small ovoid and black sails gracefully out of the trees
towards them SPLASHING heavily into the mud beside Engels

SCHENKE (contd)
(a shout)
Grenade

Schenke Krupp and Franke hit the dirt -- but Kreuzmann is
frozen in horror his eyes locked with those of Engels

The grenade EXPLODES with a sharp shattering blast taking
Engels with it
And Kreuzmann is caught in the shockwave

CUT TO
EXT FOREST - ELSEWHERE —- DUSK
Silence
A forest clearing It’s later Darker Dusk is falling
with the snow A few brief moments of perfect stillness in
the picture-postcard scene far away from the action
Not even the distant thud of gunfire any longer
Then Ebert Heydrich and Baumann stumble through the trees
Ebert scans the forest ahead with exhausted eyes his rifle
held ready at his side -- his free arm supporting the
accident-prone Heydrich Heydrich’s leg by now is soaked
with crusted blood His face is creased with pain but still

he keeps watch left and right pistol in hand

Baumann brings up the rear He’s edgy scanning the trees
behind them with rifle aimed

A few more steps and Ebert pauses to catch his breath He
whispers just loud enough for Baumann to hear

EBERT
Wait a minute

Baumann crouches and waits still covering the rear
Untangling himself from Heydrich Ebert creeps forward and
takes up position beside a tree several yards away studying
the forest ahead through field-glasses

After a moment he lowers the binoculars triumphantly

EBERT (contd)

Bunker
CUT TO
EXT ANTI-TANK BUNKER ‘FRIEDA’ —- DUSK
CLOSE -- as the steel-shutter of a narrow observation loop-

hole SLIDES open suddenly A glint of eyes in the darkness
beyond

Three metres to the left in a second loophole sunk into the
camouflaged concrete face of the bunker the twin barrels of
a combined anti-tank cannonmachine gun swivel into action
taking aim

There is the heavy metallic CLICK-CLACK of a gun being
cocked A muffled voice SHOUTS from inside
MIRUS (0S)
Stay where you are

- and Ebert’s distant voice replies from off-screen

EBERT (0S)
Don’t shoot Comrade

WIDER -- down a shallow snow-covered slope on a frozen dirt-
road which dog-legs through rows of concrete tank-traps the
three approaching soldiers stop dead in their tracks

Ebert waves his rifle wearily a dirty white handkerchief
tied to the barrel He calls again cautious

EBERT (contd)
We’re coming in Alright

No reply from the bunker

Ebert sets off again anyway half-dragging Heydrich up the
slope Baumann follows a few paces to the rear still
watching the trees behind them

The barrels of the guns follow them from the bunker as they
approach

SIDE AND REAR OF BUNKER

The huge bunker is sunk into the tree-covered hillside The
three soldiers make their way up the slope and along the side
wall stumbling occasionally in the snow or on the hidden
ropes of the camouflage netting

At the rear a deep trench leads to the entrance this is
overlooked by another loophole in the wall of the Entrance
Defence Room As they struggle down the crude steps into the
trench the steel shutter of this loophole GRATES open to
watch them

Ebert arrives first at the heavy steel door and kicks it

EBERT (contd)
Open up dammit

For a moment the three of them wait in silence and stillness
Ebert looking up at the lettering moulded into the concrete
above the door It reads ‘FRIEDA’

Sound of bolts SLAMMING back and the door swings open

Ebert stands aside to let Heydrich hobble through first

CUT TO

INT BUNKER - ENTRANCE PASSAGE —- DUSK

Heydrich is barely inside before he is PUSHED roughly against
the wall a pistol at his throat

HEYDRICH
Hey What the

And everybody FREEZES

Heydrich is staring back into the face of another German
soldier -- a reserve Volksgrenadier This is MIRUS an old
man with crazy eyes and a crazy demeanour An old livid
wound is visible on his forehead -- and he looks ill

MIRUS
(to Heydrich)
Who are you

He rips open Heydrich’s collar checking his dog-tag

MIRUS (contd)
Let me hear you speak

HEYDRICH
Heydrich 13th Panzergrenadiers

EBERT
Let him go old man

MIRUS
(to Baumann )
You Say something Why are you
here

BAUMANN
We were ambushed Now take it
easy

MIRUS
Ambushed

HEYDRICH
It’s a bit late to be asking
questions Private Put the gun
down

Mirus blinks his eyes slowly losing their crazy gleam

HEYDRICH (contd)
The gun

Mirus finally backs off Everybody BREATHES again Heydrich
rubs his throat cursing silently

As if his mind has suddenly changed gear Mirus looks at the
other three soldiers as if seeing them for the first time
He stokes his old head wound unconsciously

MIRUS
I’m sorry

The others look at him warily unsettled by his radical
change in temperament

MIRUS (cont’d)
We were warned you see About
enemy infiltration units
EBERT
If you weren’t sure about us you
should never have opened the door
Ebert SLAMS and bolts the door behind them
(They’re in a short T-shaped passage To their right a
small flight of steps leads down to another steel door to
the left the Gas Lock which leads deeper into the bunker)

Mirus shuffles sheepishly for a second embarrassed at his
behaviour then gestures for them to follow

MIRUS
This way

Mirus leads them through the

GAS LOCK

MIRUS (contd)
What happened to you again

then turns right through the gas-proof doors into the

MAIN CORRIDOR

EBERT
Ambush Americans

Doors in each wall of the corridor lead to the Generator Room
and the Crew Room Straight ahead is the door to the Gun
Room Peering around it curiously is a 2nd Volksgrenadier
This is NEUMANN young almost a boy Mirus snaps at him

MIRUS
Keep watching the front

Neumann disappears out of sight as Mirus leads the others
right again into the --

CREW ROOM

Bunks Lockers Pin-ups Military mottoes painted on the
walls Small stove Emergency Escape A Christmas tree --
with an ironic cardboard SWASTIKA on top instead of an
angel

The three newcomers slump down onto the bunks near the stove
A bit of warmth and comfort The relief spreads across their
faces -- but this only accentuates their pain and exhaustion

Heydrich stretches out his injured leg

HEYDRICH
Ahhh Shit

Meanwhile Mirus hovers nervously occasionally coughing

MIRUS
How far away did all this happen
The ambush

EBERT
Three four kilometres

MIRUS
But the front-line is supposed to
be thirty-odd kilometres away

HEYDRICH
That’s what we thought

One by one they light up cigarettes

EBERT
God knows what the Yanks were doing
there Probably don’t even know
themselves

Baumann is studying Mirus’s reaction

BAUMANN
They might be coming this way

Mirus turns pale He looks at the other two for
confirmation

MIRUS
Will they

EBERT
Maybe They were behind us for a
while back there All they have
to do is follow our tracks in the
snow

BAUMANN
(to Mirus)
How many men do you have

Mirus nervously strokes the wound on his forehead

MIRUS
Just one

The three newcomers stiffen alert The relaxation drains
from their faces to be replaced once more by tension

HEYDRICH
You mean that kid

MIRUS
Everybody else was sent forward
They even took our supplies

EBERT
Christ

HEYDRICH
Is it like this all along the line
now Just Reserves

MIRUS
I don’t know I think so
(defensive)
There’s not supposed to be any
fighting here

BAUMANN
Someone forgot to tell the Yanks

EBERT
(to Mirus)
Youd better get onto Area Command

Mirus turns to leave fretting Ebert calls after him

EBERT (contd)
What was it you said before about
infiltration units

MIRUS
Americans in German uniform
Sometimes they --

EBERT
We know what they are What about
them

MIRUS

We were just told to be on the
lookout for them

EBERT
Well don’t shoot at anyone until
you know who it is There may be
others coming from our unit

Mirus nods and exits Ebert snorts derisively

EBERT (contd)
I don’t believe it Kids and sick
crazy old men left in charge

HEYDRICH
That’s what it’s come to alright

A moment of brooding silence Heydrich gets out his first-
aid kit and sees to his leg

Ebert gets up and smells the coffee pot on the stove
Ersatz He pulls a sour face but pours a mug-full anyway
passes it around Baumann continues where they’d left off

BAUMANN
So if the Yanks attack again
it’1l be up to us

EBERT
They won’t necessarily come after
us They might have other
priorities

But he doesn’t sound as if he quite believes it And it’s
clear from their faces that nor do Heydrich and Baumann

Ebert stares for a moment into his coffee mug -- then raises
it in a tired ironic toast

EBERT (contd)
Well Happy Christmas

Sudden SHOUT from the Gun Room

MIRUS (0S)
Someone’s coming

CUT TO
EBERT’S POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS
A small group of German soldiers flit cautiously between the
trees at the bottom of the slope overlooked by the bunker
Three maybe four of them
EBERT (0S)

Ours alright Whats left of
them

BAUMANN (0S)
Can I see

CUT TO

INT GUN ROOM - DUSK

Ebert is peering out through the loophole He passes the
binoculars to Baumann then turns to Neumann at the gun

EBERT
Whats your name

NEUMANN
Neumann sir

Ebert looks around (The room is dim -- lights out because
the loophole cover is open) 47 cm cannonmachine gun ammo
boxes door to the Ammunition Room not much else

In the bg Mirus is on the wall-mounted field-telephone AD-
LIBBING terse monosyllabic comments and replies

Heydrich is leaning expectantly in the doorway
Ebert turns back to Neumann and indicates the huge gun

EBERT
Are you alright with this

Neumann nods with a hint of defiance

NEUMANN
I used to be on a Flak unit

Ebert is quiet for a moment looking sadly at this over-
confident kid who should be back at home with his family

He gestures at Mirus and continues

EBERT
Did he explain to you whats going
on Whats his name

NEUMANN
Mirus Yes sir

EBERT
Alright Keep the gun trained on
the trees Just in case

Neumann nods

EBERT (contd)
This isnt like shooting at planes
If you have to fire use short
bursts

Another dismissive slightly annoyed nod and Neumann puts
his eye back to the gunsight

Mirus hangs up the phone Hes even more agitated now
MIRUS
They just said to let them know of
any developments Thats all
EBERT
(ironic)
Great
Sound of indistinct SHOUTING from outside
BAUMANN
Theyre out of the trees Coming
in
BAUMANNS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS
The four soldiers are now dodging between the concrete tank-
traps waving towards the bunker One of them is being
helped along by the others
BAUMANN (0S) (contd)
Krupp Schenke Franke Cant see

who theyre dragging Is it
Kreuzmann

BACK TO SCENE

EBERT
Call out to them

Baumann opens his mouth to shout through the loophole
GUNFIRE bursts from the distant trees
Baumann and Ebert instinctively duck grabbing their rifles

BAUMANN
Shit

Mirus scrambles back to the gun Pushes Neumann out of the
way Takes over

Baumann works the bolt on his rifle
Aims through the loophole
FIRES towards the trees

CUT TO

EXT BUNKER - DUSK

Panic

The four newcomers are yelling incoherently as they scramble
up the icy slope under fire from an unseen enemy

SHOTS are coming from the trees KICKING into the snow
around them PRANGING off the concrete tank-traps Theyre
in the open -- sitting ducks

Franke is dragging the injured Kreuzmann Krupp is pushing
them along with one hand and FIRING blindly towards the trees
with the other Schenke brings up the rear laying down a
covering fire as he backs up the slope

On their faces is the fear of God

Schenke is HIT He shouts involuntarily and stumbles but a
second later he is up again still firing

A bullet CLANGS against the side of Frankes helmet
He shouts a string of incoherent CURSES
All this happens in the space of six seconds
CUT TO
INT BUNKER - GUN ROOM - DUSK
Baumann squeezes off another SHOT Ebert SHOUTS at Mirus

EBERT
What the hell are you waiting for

MIRUS
I cant see the enemy

EBERT
Just fire

The machine gun EXPLODES into action The NOISE within the
confined concrete space is incredible

Baumann FIRES again finishing his clip
Pulls away from the loophole
Ebert takes his place instantly firing

Neumann breaks open a new ammo belt for the gun
Heydrich finishes loading shells into a rifle magazine
Tosses it to Baumann

EBERT (contd)
Theyre coming around the side

Baumann SLAMS the clip into his rifle

BAUMANN
I’m alright here Go

Ebert pulls away from the loophole and Baumann smoothly takes
his place FIRING immediately

Heydrich catches on straight away

Follows Ebert out of the room

MAIN CORRIDOR AND GAS LOCK

Ebert races for the rear Heydrich hobbles behind him

HEYDRICH
Ill get the door

They pile into the Gas Lock Ebert branches off right
Heydrich goes left around the dog-leg to the main door
ENTRANCE DEFENCE ROOM

A small bare cramped room Loophole in the outer wall

Ebert is at the loophole in an instant Checks outside
SHOUTS through to Heydrich

EBERT
Clear

ENTRANCE PASSAGE

Heydrich pulls open the door just in time for the new
arrivals to SPILL inside almost falling over each other

He SLAMS the door shut behind them
They collapse against the wall and sink to the floor For a
few moments they say nothing catching their breath and

gradually realising theyre still alive

Franke leans back with his eyes closed pale and trembling
and hugging his steel helmet to his chest

Lieutenant Krupp wipes his face with a handkerchief -- and
looks uneasily around the cramped space pulling open his
collar

The MUFFLED SHOOTING continues in the bg

Heydrich takes a look at Kreuzmann who is semi-conscious and
obviously in the worst condition

HEYDRICH
What happened to the others

Schenke struggles back to his feet painfully

SCHENKE
Take a wild guess

KRUPP
(to Heydrich)
Who else is here

HEYDRICH
Ebert and Baumann

Schenke starts to CHUCKLE ironically but it emerges as a
breathless cough He looks at his wounded side -- then
suddenly KICKS the wall in a violent cathartic release of
tension

CUT TO
INT GUN ROOM - DUSK

The machine gun is still BOOMING The air is thick with
cordite smoke Baumann is trying to shout over the noise

The gun stops momentarily

BAUMANN
-- enough Hold fire

Another short BURST and the gun stops again
Empty shells RATTLE down the collection tube

Sudden complete silence

Mirus is glued rigid to the gunsight of the machine gun
Baumann cautiously peeks through the loophole

BAUMANN (contd)
That might hold them for a while

Krupp enters and takes in the scene He throws a glance at
Baumann then addresses Mirus

KRUPP
Are you in charge here

Mirus and Neumann straighten to attention

MIRUS
Yes sir

Krupp heads immediately for the loophole and Baumann steps
aside to give him access He turns for the door but Krupp
calls him back

KRUPP
Baumann

Baumann stops where he is and waits patiently whilst Krupp
studies the scene outside

KRUPP (contd)
(to Mirus)
Youve been on to Area Command

MIRUS
Yes sir

KRUPP
That covering fire was bloody late
Who was on the gun

Mirus hesitates momentarily -- coughing

MIRUS
I was sir

Krupp turns away from the loophole and looks Mirus up and
down taking in his Volksgrenadier uniform and noticing for
the first time how sick he appears

KRUPP
Jesus You look worse than us

Mirus says nothing waiting for his telling-off Neumann
too is expectant -- but Krupp leaves it hanging in the air

KRUPP (contd)
What other covering fire is there
apart from this

MIRUS
Theres a machine gun nest across
the pass sir -- But nobody to man

it
Krupp nods to himself
KRUPP
Alright I11 talk to Area Command
again In the meantime if

anything moves out there shoot
Instantly

Mirus SNAPS his heels relieved

MIRUS
Yes sir

He turns back to the gunsight -- whilst Neumanns face
betrays a momentary disappointment and irritation that Mirus
is off the hook

Meanwhile Krupp half-turns to Baumann

KRUPP
How long ago did you get here

BAUMANN
Just a few minutes before you did

A pregnant pause

BAUMANN (contd)
We looked for you

Krupp turns away again without reply

He looks around the smoky room and suddenly seems short of
breath Face close to the loophole for air he tugs at his
collar claustrophobicaly and barks an order

KRUPP
Someone turn on the vents

CUT TO
INT CREW ROOM —- DUSK

Kreuzmann is helped onto one of the bunks by Franke and
Schenke Heydrich following behind with his kit Having let
go of Kreuzmann Schenke slumps onto the next bunk looking
down again at his bleeding side He’s still steamed

SCHENKE
Bastards Behind us all the
shitting way Dont they know when
to quit

FRANKE
Let me see it

Franke tries to look at his wound but Schenke shrugs him off
angrily gesturing at Kreuzmann

SCHENKE
Just get on with pampering him

Heydrich is still settling Kreuzmann

HEYDRICH
(calmly)
He’s hurt Schenke And he lost
his friend back there

Schenke isn’t impressed but drops the subject Franke takes
over the tending of Kreuzmann and Heydrich hobbles over to a
bunk at the other side of the room

Schenke eases himself back against the wall taking deep
breaths to calm himself and control the pain -- an Iron Cross
2nd class glinting visibly on his tunic

Then he rests momentarily eying Heydrich

SCHENKE
How many do you think out there

HEYDRICH
Who knows Enough anyway

SCHENKE
I reckon two or three snipers and a
machine gun each side of the road
Plus maybe a couple on demolition

HEYDRICH
(shaking head)
More than that

SCHENKE
If we hadn’t split up we couldve
fought it out

HEYDRICH
(impatient)
And got ourselves killed

SCHENKE
It was ten or twelve men at most

HEYDRICH
Yes and God knows how many more
coming up from behind

SCHENKE
(surprised)
What do you mean You saw others

HEYDRICH
I didn’t see them no but --

SCHENKE
Then who says

Heydrich shakes his head dismissively annoyed that he’d
allowed himself to be drawn into an argument

HEYDRICH
(weary )
Don’t start Schenke

Schenke glances over at Franke momentarily intrigued -- then
leans forward eagerly

SCHENKE
We pulled back without bumping into
anyone else How do you think we
got out of there
(a pause)
(MORE )

So Who rechmxkHhecraw ll these
other Yanks

Heydrich remains silent -- and Schenke suddenly becomes aware
that Baumann is standing in the doorway listening

Baumann and Schenke glare at each other for a moment -- then
Schenke SNIGGERS shaking his head contemptuously

Baumann stands his ground defiantly

BAUMANN
Krupp wants you up front

Schenke takes a small container from his pocket shakes a
pill into his hand and tosses it into his mouth

Then he gets to his feet and strolls to the door -- pausing
just long enough to glare once more into Baumann’s eyes --
pointedly and childishly polishing his Iron Cross with his
cuff -- as if to emphasis that Baumann doesn’t have one

And with that Schenke exits

HEYDRICH
(after a moment)
Little bastard

Baumann changes the subject

BAUMANN
We’re going to siege conditions
Krupp wants you to organise a rota
three-hour shifts

Heydrich nods gets up and departs without further comment
The shocked and injured Kreuzmann meanwhile who has remained

semi-conscious throughout is slowly coming to his senses
Still groggy he struggles to focus on Franke and Baumann

KREUZMANN
(after a moment)
Did Engels make it
FRANKE
(gently)
No
He’s momentarily confused -- then anguish creases his face

as if the memories of what had happened suddenly flood back

FRANKE (cont’d)
It’s alright We’re safe now

Baumann watches as tears drip silently from Kreuzmann’s eyes
Uncomfortable he too departs

Left alone with Kreuzmann Franke struggles to find words of
comfort

FRANKE (cont’d)
I couldn’t have got to him
Kreuzmann I’m sorry

KREUZMANN

Nobody tried to help him Not even
me

Franke doesn’t know what else to say Instead he slumps
back and blows out a weary sigh

Kreuzmann composes himself slightly after a few moments

KREUZMANN (cont’d)
Where is this place

FRANKE

(a shrug)
Just an anti-tank bunker

Kreuzmann shivers momentarily suddenly chilled He glances
around the room as if sensing something

KREUZMANN
It’s not safe here

But Franke is no longer listening he’s studying the fresh
bullet-dent on the side of his steel helmet introspectively
as if dwelling on the close-shave
So Kreuzmann turns his attention again to his surroundings --
his gaze finally settling on the square steel hatch leading
to the bunker’s Emergency Escape shaft

CUT TO
INT GUN ROOM - NIGHT

Darkness except for the faint diffused moonlight filtering
in through the loophole at which Schenke is keeping watch

Mirus and Neumann are manning the cannon while Baumann
Ebert and Heydrich wait expectantly just inside the doorway

Krupp meanwhile is on the field telephone

KRUPP
- but the situation’s approaching
critical -- No we don’t know that
for sure -- Yes -- Yes alright

He puts down the receiver exasperated and turns to the
group

KRUPP (contd)
All units are up at the front No
reinforcements available We’re to
hold until relieved

EBERT
Hold with what

KRUPP
I doubt they’1ll attack the bunker
They don’t know we’re low on ammo
and this time they don’t have the
element of surprise

EBERT
They don’t need it if there’s an
armoured column heading straight
for us

Krupp glares at him flustered and annoyed There are
clearly still tensions between the two surviving halves of
the group

KRUPP
And where’s this armoured column
coming from

EBERT
The same place they did We dont
know whats going on at the front
line

KRUPP
Command think it’s either an
infiltration unit or an isolated
pocket of resistance

SCHENKE
And what do you think about that
Baumann

Baumann ignores the mocking tone of Schenke’s voice

BAUMANN
I think there’s a lot more out
there than we realise

SCHENKE
Well that’s your story anyway

HEYDRICH
Leave it Schenke You don’t know
what you’re talking abou --

BAUMANN
Don’t make excuses for me Not to
him

There’s a second of icy tension -- then Ebert picks up where
the conversation left off

EBERT
Either way they must’ve spotted
weve no covering fire across the
pass And now that it’s dark
there’s nothing to stop them
surrounding the bunker

SCHENKE
So what They wont get in --
unless one of you plans on opening
the door for them

HEYDRICH
(to Krupp)
Ebert’s right And despite having
Superman here on our side
(a gesture at Schenke)
- without ammo we cant stop
them

KRUPP
And I say they wont attack

EBERT
Why Because its Christmas Eve

Krupp opens his mouth to argue but Heydrich interrupts

HEYDRICH
Lieutenant you saw the way they
came after us They’re not just
doing their job - theyre trying to
be heroes

He holds out his sleeve indicating the black silver-
lettered divisional insignia which they all wear

HEYDRICH (contd)
And if they do get in they won’t
be taking any prisoners

There is a moment of reflective silence which temporarily
humbles the group Finally Ebert again raises his original
point

EBERT
So With the bunker surrounded
what options do we have when the
ammo runs out

Neumann glances at Mirus expecting him to say something but
the old man is keeping quiet He then looks at Schenke and
summons up the courage to speak himself

NEUMANN
Theres always the tunnels

Everybody looks at him

CUT TO
INT ENTRANCE PASSAGE and ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT
Ebert DRAGS open the bolts of a steel door

Schenke Heydrich Krupp Neumann and Mirus are crowded
behind him on the short flight of steps running down from
the entrance passage which we glimpsed earlier

Ebert shoves the door open eagerly and shines his torch into
the narrow Access Tunnel beyond about ten metres long
concrete walls another steel door at the other end

NEUMANN
There Through that other door

EBERT
And whats in there

Neumann shrugs and glances at Mirus who answers reluctantly

MIRUS
Only rats

HEYDRICH
Jesus dont tell Kreuzmann

EBERT
(to Mirus)
I meant what are they for

MIRUS
Munitions storage I think But
they were never finished

EBERT
Why

MIRUS
(a shrug)
I don’t know Too many cave-ins
maybe Theyre not safe

EBERT
But youve been in

Mirus is curiously uncomfortable

MIRUS
Not very far

NEUMANN
They must go right under the woods
Theres a main entrance at the
other side of the hill Ive seen
it from the outside

SCHENKE
Were they ever used Could there
still be ammunition stored in
there

MIRUS
I havent been in that far I told
you it’s not safe

EBERT
Why dont we take a look

Ebert starts in his curiosity clearly aroused -- but Krupp
calls him back impatiently

KRUPP
No

SCHENKE
But if there’s the possibility of --

KRUPP

(interrupting)
We were told to stay put Unless
something happens well do as
were ordered

(to Mirus and Schenke)
And youre both still on watch in
case you’d forgotten

Krupp shoos Mirus and Schenke back towards the Gun Room and
follows after them calling out to Ebert as he goes

KRUPP (contd)
And make sure that door’s closed

Ebert waits until Krupp has gone then whispers to Heydrich

EBERT
I could just have a quick look

HEYDRICH
You heard the Lieutenant

EBERT
Yeah I heard him He’s getting

jumpy

HEYDRICH
Well it’s not every day two-thirds
of the unit gets wiped out in one
go
(a pause)
And look at the group he’s been
left with

Ebert ignores the comment with a shrug pulling closed the
Access Tunnel door

CUT TO
INT ENTRANCE DEFENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Baumann is on watch alone Hes cold bored and exhausted
He glances out through the loophole momentarily

BAUMANNS POV

The bunker entrance is visible in the diffuse moonlight
All is quiet As Ebert had done earlier he focusses for a
moment on the name moulded above the steel door

BACK TO SCENE

Moving aside from the loophole he fishes in his tunic for a
cigarette Lights it with a wind-proof lighter

He then takes out his wallet Folded inside is a dog-eared
PHOTOGRAPH which he holds in the glow from the lighter It
shows a young woman cradling a cat in her arms

He studies the photo thinking and the tough face of the
soldier softens for a second

Franke enters and catches sight of the photo before Baumann
SNAPS the lighter shut

FRANKE
The watch has changed Go get
something to eat

Baumann takes another pull on his cigarette Hes about to
stub it out and leave -- but Franke appears as if he wants to
talk so Baumann offers the butt to him Franke accepts it
awkwardly

FRANKE (contd)
Thanks
(a pause)
So what about the old man eh
Jesus He’s sick he shouldnt be
here in his state

BAUMANN
None of us should be here

Franke gets to the point

FRANKE
Listen Schenke was out of line
earlier Always trying to prove

something
Baumann says nothing

FRANKE (contd)
You heard what slipped out the
other week About how he applied
to join the SS - and they wouldnt
have him

Baumann nods a thin smile on his lips

BAUMANN
I heard

FRANKE
Hes keyed-up on benzedrine half
the time Getting too fond of it
Hell get us all killed one day

Franke takes a long deep nervous pull on the cigarette

FRANKE (contd)
I tell you I was scared shitless
back there Weve ridden our luck
too long and its due to run out
(he pauses)
Half a chance and I wouldve done
the same as you

BAUMANN
What do you mean

FRANKE
Got out of there while I could
Every man for himself

He takes another pull and offers the cigarette back to

Baumann But Baumann just looks at him curiously -- face

blank -- and turns away

Franke frowns confused -- knowing he said the wrong thing
CUT TO

INT CREW ROOM —- NIGHT

Krupp Schenke and Mirus are sitting around the stove
heating soup

As they do so they AD-LIB war anecdotes the warmth and
coziness -- and in Miruss case a bottle of spirits --
having eased the tension slightly

Neumann sits nearby listening with boyish fascination
Kreuzmann is huddled on a corner bunk asleep

MIRUS

- but he wouldnt listen So of
course when he pulled the trigger
it blew right back in his face
Took his eye out and half his
cheek with it

(grim chuckle)
Served him right I say

SCHENKE
Christ

Ebert meanwhile slings on his rifle and takes a last gulp
of his soup before heading for the door to go on watch
Schenke spies this and calls after him

SCHENKE (contd)
Come on Ebert Tell us a quick
war story before you go

EBERT
You’re the hero Schenke Not me

He departs crossing with Baumann in the doorway Schenke
watches as Baumann silently finds an empty bunk

SCHENKE
(to no one in particular)
And not much point asking him is
there

Baumann ignores him He takes his mug from his kit-bag
fills it with soup and settles back on his bunk to drink it

Mirus meanwhile is offering around the booze once more
Coughing he pours a shot for himself and Krupp and holds
the bottle out for Schenke

MIRUS
Go on have one Look upon it as
medicine

SCHENKE

I told you I dont drink
(changing subject)

So whats your story anyway

How’d you get the head wound

MIRUS
Got that on the front line in
seventeen Shell fragment
(MORE )

Some of it MrResi(cbnindhere -- but
it doesnt bother me much

Schenke pulls a covert knowing face at Krupp

Suppressing a smile Krupp turns to Neumann who has been
listening quietly in the bg enthralled

KRUPP
You dont say much do you Come
on its your turn

Neumann shuffles uncomfortable and unsure what to say

KRUPP (contd)
Alright never mind the war
stories How about something funny
that happened to you at school

Krupp laughs Schenke and Mirus join in Neumann blushes
furiously embarrassed

SCHENKE
Ah leave him Hes alright
Dont worry kid

Schenke taps his Iron Cross

SCHENKE (contd)
Theres plenty of time to win one
of these This wars not over yet
believe me

Neumann looks at Schenke grateful for the comment Baumann
watching the brief exchange notices the look of reverence in
Neumanns face

However the atmosphere of anecdotal jollity has stalled --
and Krupps attention has been shifted back to the present by
Schenkes comment Hes thoughtful for a moment

KRUPP
So what else do you know about
those tunnels old man Could we
get out that way in an emergency
or not

Mirus is evasive

MIRUS
Maybe Im not really sure

KRUPP
You know more than youre letting
on dont you Whatre you hiding

Mirus shrugs dismissively

MIRUS
Nothing

But Krupp is still waiting so Mirus finally continues

MIRUS (cont’d)
All I know is theres a whole maze
of tunnels and storage chambers
Maybe there’s a way through - maybe
not

SCHENKE
So what happened Why did they
abandon the site

MIRUS
I think there was some kind of
revolt by the slave-workers The
OT closed the site temporarily
and never came back Probably the
local folk-tales didnt help
matters

KRUPP
What do you mean

MIRUS
People around here have unpleasant
stories about these woods Ask the
kid Hell tell you

KRUPP
Youre not talking about ghost
stories

Krupp glances around the room incredulous Mirus says
nothing

KRUPP (contd)
Youre trying to tell me they
stopped construction on a military
installation because of a few ghost
stories

Krupp and Schenke snigger -- but Mirus is serious his mind
seemingly elsewhere

MIRUS
You can laugh here But in there --
in the dark -- its easy to believe

all sorts of things
Krupp and Schenke’s derisory laughter wakes Kreuzmann who
emerges from his sleep disorientated He groggily turns over
on his bunk and sits upright

Schenke turns his attention back to Mirus sneering
34

SCHENKE
So just what are these folk-tales
Mirus thinks for a second -- then decides
MIRUS
Alright I’11 tell you
He shuffles settling for his story -- taking their sceptical
reaction as a challenge -- and getting that crazy gleam in

his eyes once again He begins

MIRUS (contd)
You have to remember these woods
are ancient Older than Germany
People have talked about them for
centuries They used to burn
witches here because the place was
supposed to be evil But it was
during the Black Death that the
tales really started

Everybody is listening intently Kreuzmann looks around
puzzled and wondering what hes missed

MIRUS (cont’d)
The disease was sweeping across the
continent The village near here
was isolated and they thought they
could escape the infection But
there was no escape The Plague
finally took hold and started to
spread through the village like
wild-fire and once infected
friends suddenly became enemies

Mirus pauses theatrically enjoying the reactions of the
others as theyre drawn in to the story Kreuzmann is
particularly unsettled

MIRUS (cont’d)
Then at the height of the Plague
a stranger arrived in the village
Some say he was a priest If he
was then he was a priest of the
unholy Before long he began to
turn the villagers against each
other It didnt take much He
offered to rid the village of the
Plague once and for all And
people believed him

Kreuzmann is now white as a ghost

MIRUS (cont’d)
One dreadful night he roused the
villagers into a frenzy

(MORE )

He led a mottRdsiatonirayp the sick

and infected people out of the
village burning their houses one
by one They were pursued into
these woods hunted down like dogs
and when they were finally
surrounded they were slaughtered
mercilessly Then their poisoned
bodies were buried in the ground

Kreuzmann has listened to enough Pale and trembling he
shakily gets to his feet and leaves the room

The spell is broken Everybody shuffles uncomfortably
Mirus looks around His crazy expression has gone again

MIRUS (contd)
Whats the matter

Schenke glares after Kreuzmann

SCHENKE
Dont worry about it old man hes
got no stomach thats all Been
like that for a while

Baumann looks at Schenke silently -- and Schenke returns
his gaze with defiant contempt

CUT TO
INT GAS LOCK - NIGHT

Kreuzmann is leaning over the drain beneath the water tap in
the corner Head down breathing deeply as if about to be
sick The door of the Gun Room is ajar and Ebert peers
around it to see what’s going on

EBERT
You alright

Kreuzmann is still groggy and disorientated He turns on the
tap and takes a few sips of water from his hand Then he
takes a few unsteady steps along the corridor clearly
uncomfortable with the surroundings

KREUZMANN
What’s happening Are they still
out there

EBERT
All the way around probably

And this unsettles Kreuzmann even more

KREUZMANN
You mean we’re surrounded

Ebert realises his mistake

EBERT
Chances are they won’t try
anything

KREUZMANN

But they could get in If they
really wanted to We all know

that

EBERT
There’s probably not enough of them
to try

Kreuzmann ignores him nervously fingering his cuff insignia

KREUZMANN
And you know what they do to elite
division troops As far as they’re
concerned we’re no better than SS

EBERT
Take it easy

Kreuzmann however won’t be consoled

KREUZMANN
There’s something about this place
Something not right Almost as if
we were meant to

He trails off cryptically then looks at EBERT again

KREUZMANN (cont’d)
You haven’t figured it out yet
have you

EBERT
What

KREUZMANN
With Engels and the others dead
it’s just us again Just the seven
of us

Ebert does seem to know what he’s talking about -- but he
changes the subject awkwardly

FRANKE
Better get some more rest while you
can You’re probably still
concussed

But Kreuzmann is now staring with moist emotional eyes at
the motto carefully hand painted over the Gun Room door It
reads ‘GOTT MIT UNS’

KREUZMANN
‘God With Us’
(then to Ebert)
But he’s not anymore is he We’re
on our own

And Ebert doesn’t have an answer Kreuzmann turns away
silently and heads back towards the Crew Room

CUT TO
INT CREW ROOM
Kreuzmann re-enters the room as discretely as he can
The others are in the process of settling down to get some
sleep Baumann is already huddled on his bunk facing the
wall Schenke meanwhile props himself up on his pillow
flicking through an army magazine
And Kreuzmann waits for a moment by the door -- just
watching the others pensively as if seeing them for what

they are for the very first time

CUT TO

EXT BUNKER - NIGHT

A wind is beginning to gust through the trees driving the
falling snow before it

CUT TO
INT BUNKER - GUN ROOM - NIGHT
Ebert is crouched with his back to the cannon idly blowing
cigarette smoke into his hands and rubbing them together to
keep warm
Heydrich is leaning close to the loophole his eyelids heavy
He breaths in sharply and rubs his face trying to stay
awake
Hearing something he cocks his head to one side listening
HEYDRICH
(a whisper)
Come here

Ebert reluctantly gets to his feet

EBERT
What is it

HEYDRICH
Listen

They lean closer to the loophole

From the trees carried on the wind the faint tune of a
distant harmonica the beautiful hymn SILENT NIGHT

They listen Heydrich peering outside

HEYDRICH (contd)
I love the snow

For a fleeting moment hes MOVED -- then he swallows push-
ing back emotions which are welling up from God knows where

Ebert looks at his wristwatch struggling to see it in the
shaft of dull diffuse moonlight

EBERT
Midnight It’s Christmas

CUT TO
INT CREW ROOM - NIGHT
All is still and quiet All are asleep Even the
hyperactive Schenke slouched casually on his bunk with his

magazine is nodding-off involuntarily

Kreuzmanns sleep however is troubled He shuffles in his

bunk unsettled -- as if having a nightmare

CUT TO
EXT FOREST - NIGHT
A distorted and surreal sequence -- typical of a dream

Flaming torches dozens of them are dancing like fire-flies
between the dark distant trees accompanied by aggressive
but incoherent SHOUTS

Suddenly a group of figures BURST into the foreground also

carrying wooden torches and clearly in pursuit of something

Their dress and appearance is strange -- like people from the
middle-ages

They carry spears clubs and bows

They YELL excitedly shouting encouragement to unseen
comrades -- as if theyve just spotted something -- and speed
up their pursuit

They split up quickly and rush to surround something bearing
down upon it with weapons raised then halting in satisfied
anticipation when they have it cornered

Silhouetted in the flickering fire-light -- huddled ina
frightened defensive group -- their quarry is revealed

A small group of men -- wearing the incongruous but
distinctive uniforms of German soldiers

CUT TO
INT BUNKER - CREW ROOM - NIGHT
Kreuzmann awakes with a START
Sweating profusely taking a second or two to remember where
he is Then calming down slightly he looks around to see

if anyone noticed his abrupt awakening

All is just as it was before -- except that Mirus’ bunk is
now empty

CUT TO
INT ENTRANCE PASSAGE - NIGHT
Mirus is up to something

He creeps down the short flight of steps to the Access Tunnel
door torch in hand -- and gently works open the steel bolts

Easing the door open he pauses momentarily to ensure he
hasnt been heard -- then quietly heads into the tunnel
beyond half-closing the door behind him

But he’s being observed through the crack in the Gas lock
door which is not properly closed

Mirus having moved out of sight Kreuzmann silently opens the
Gas Lock door He too listens for a moment to ensure
Franke hasn’t heard anything through the heavy steel door of
the Entrance Defence room
Then satisfied he follows after Mirus furtively

CUT TO
INT ACCESS TUNNEL
FOLLOWING KREUZMANN -- as he creeps along the short dark
length of the tunnel chasing the faint wavering glow from
Miruss torch which is visible through the second steel door

ajar at the end of the passage

He stops a yard from the door torch in hand but not switched
on

He seems to have a fleeting moment of indecision

Then an indistinct WHISPER draws his attention back towards
Mirus Kreuzmann eases closer to the door and peers around

KREUZMANNS POV

Mirus is standing about ten yards away his back to
Kreuzmann He’s silhouetted against the dim glow from his
own torch which is just sufficient to hint at the
surroundings a tall wide concrete-lined tunnel which
intersects the Access Tunnel at right angles

Now Mirus whispers again louder as if calling to someone

MIRUS
Martin Im here Come talk to
me
He listens for a moment -- then continues forward into the

darkness

BACK TO SCENE

Despite his nervousness and confusion Kreuzmann seems to
come to a sudden mental decision Using a pen-knife he
quickly begins digging and cutting at the stitching of the
black cuff-bands on his coat

Finally ripping them loose he tosses them aside Then
picking at the torn threads which remain in his sleeves he
slips through the door and silently goes after Mirus

CUT TO
INT BUNKER - CREW ROOM - NIGHT
Ebert shakes Baumann awake as gently and quietly as he can
Baumann turns over in his bunk and looks at Ebert groggily
and Ebert quickly holds a finger to his mouth
EBERT
(a whisper)
Shhh Don’t wake Krupp

But it’s too late

KRUPP
What’s the matter Ebert

Krupp sits up in his bunk blinking himself awake Ebert
glances sheepishly at Baumann before answering

EBERT
I’m not sure I can’t find
Mirus Or Kreuzmann

Krupp glances at his wrist-watch

KRUPP
Whos on watch

EBERT
Me Heydrich and Franke But its
time for the shift-change

KRUPP
What do you mean you cant find
them

Again Ebert is reluctant to drop his comrade in it

EBERT
It looks like theyre in the
tunnels

Krupp stands up a look of confused incredulity on his face

He moves around the bunks shaking the others awake his
sleep-befuddled mind still trying to think it through

KRUPP
(to Schenke and Neumann)
Up -- Get up

Schenke and Neumann roll out of their bunks

KRUPP (contd)
Relieve Heydrich in the Gun Room

Schenke rubs his face He doesnt look as if he slept above
half an hour and he automatically reaches for the container
of benzedrine pills in his pocket

SCHENKE
Whats going on

KRUPP
Do it now please

Neumann jumps to it Schenke gets up and follows glancing
sideways at Krupp as he departs

After a moment Krupp turns back to Ebert picking up the
thread of the conversation

KRUPP (contd)
Theyre deserting

EBERT
We dont know that

KRUPP
What else do you think theyre
doing in there Exploring
They’re looking for a way out

BAUMANN
If theyd wanted to get out they
couldve gone through the door

KRUPP
If I remember you were the one who
suggested the bunker might be
surrounded The tunnels seem a
pretty obvious way out to me

(to Ebert)
Whatever the reasons I want them
back
EBERT
I’1l go
KRUPP

Alright Take Heydrich

BAUMANN
Heydrich’s injured I1l go

Baumann stands up strapping on his pistol belt

BAUMANN (contd)
Unless of course you dont trust
me to come back

Krupp returns Baumanns defiant gaze

KRUPP
Just dont be too long

CUT TO

INT TUNNEL SYSTEM —- NIGHT

Baumann and Ebert step from the Access Tunnel into the wider
tunnel where Kreuzmann went after Mirus and they shine their
torches in different directions checking the place out

This place is creepy Bare concrete walls curved roof with
lighting fixtures flat concrete floor with narrow-gauge rail-
track running off into the pitch-blackness in either
direction side-tunnels branching off at intervals

EBERT
God the airs foul Nice bit of
work though Looks safe enough to
me

BAUMANN
Probably not all like this

Their voices echo away in an eerily disembodied fashion

EBERT
Ill go this way

BAUMANN
Were not sticking together

EBERT
Why You scared of the dark now

Hes wearing a teasing half-smile -- which Baumann returns
BAUMANN
Alright Well cover more ground
at least
EBERT

I doubt well find them I found
these in the Access Tunnel before
I woke you

Hes keeping his voice low just in case Pulls out the pair
of black cuff-bands crudely torn from Kreuzmann’s uniform

EBERT (contd)
Kreuzmann mustve dropped them If
Krupp knew about this hed send
Schenke after him -- or inform the
Field Police Or both

Ebert looks Baumann in the eye -- awaiting his response to
that last statement He’s putting his trust in him

BAUMANN
He wont hear about it from me

EBERT
Well if they did find a way out
they’1l be long gone So why don’t
we take the opportunity to look
around -- just in case we ever need
a way out

BAUMANN
Fine with me

They split up
BAUMANN (contd)
Ill follow this cable duct See

if I can find a generator

EBERT
See you back here

Ebert waves a laconic hand in reply as he departs

Baumann meanwhile heads in the opposite direction his
torch-beam following the power-cables running along the top
of the wall

Hes only gone a few paces when his torch-beam begins to
weaken and flicker He gives the torch a shake and the beam
brightens again

He looks around to call to his comrade

BAUMANN
Ebert

But theres suddenly no sign of him and Baumanns voice
merely echoes away into the solid darkness

Hes alone

CUT TO

INT BUNKER - GUN ROOM - NIGHT

Krupp is interrogating Neumann The kid is nervous and
keeps looking to Schenke for support

But Schenke -- keeping watch at the loophole -- is leaving
things to Krupp for the moment

NEUMANN
» I tell you I dont know

KRUPP
Why is it nobody knows anything
around here
(a sigh)
The old mans always wandering off
into the tunnels but you dont
know why

NEUMANN
Hes never gone for very long
An hour or so just to be by
himself He sometimes gets
confused

Krupp snorts in mock surprise

KRUPP
Surely not

NEUMANN
But it’s not just his head wound
Or the fact that he’s getting sick
He lost his son earlier this year

Schenke glances at Neumann for a second -- then turns his
attention back outside He speaks quietly

SCHENKE
Weve all lost someone

KRUPP
(continuing to Neumann)
Either way we can assume he’s
showing Kreuzmann a way out

NEUMANN
(shaking head)
Id doubt that Sir
KRUPP
Why
NEUMANN

Im not sure Mirus would let anyone
go with him Hes always told me
to stay away from the tunnels He
treats them as if they belong to
him

SCHENKE
Is that why he was trying to
frighten us with ghost stories To
try to keep us out

NEUMANN
Maybe

He looks to Schenke again now -- anxious to please
NEUMANN (cont’d)

He sometimes acts as if as if

theres something in there he

doesnt want anyone to know about
Krupp and Schenke exchange a glance

CUT TO

INT TUNNEL SYSTEM - GENERATOR ROOM

Baumann shoves open the heavy steel door and steps inside
shining his torch around

Hes in a longish room with concrete partitions separating
the heavy utility equipment -- diesel generator oil burner
air-filtration system all dusty and slightly cobwebbed

He checks the fuel-gauge on the generator pulls a face and
advances further into the room

Shakes a couple of jerry-cans -- but theyre empty

A table near the main electrical junction-box has been left
with an assortment of clutter piled high Baumann unrolls a
large diagram and studies it Some kind of plan

A NOISE from somewhere -- unidentifiable Baumann tenses

BAUMANN
Ebert

He heads back towards the door folding the diagram

SIDE-TUNNEL OUTSIDE GENERATOR ROOM

Baumann inches through the Generator Room door securing the
diagram inside his tunic and shining his torch in either
direction along the narrow side-tunnel

Nothing
He steps out and begins to head along the tunnel

His torch beam flickers again He pauses and bangs it
against the wall The beam steadies momentarily

- then goes out

BAUMANN (contd)
Shit
(louder now)
Ebert Are you there

TUNNEL SYSTEM - ELSEWHERE

Ebert pauses -- as if he heard something behind him -- then
shakes his head and continues forward

He studies the walls and roof curiously as he moves from a
concrete-lined tunnel-section into an unfinished section

He squeezes past a huge metal rubbish wagon piled with
rubble but abandoned on the track More clutter is scattered
around Tools timber sacks of concrete-mix

MOVEMENT at the extreme limits of his torch-light -- far
along the tunnel -- just a glimpse as something disappears
around a corner A figure

EBERT
Kreuzmann Mirus

He heads towards the movement -- stumbling along the rubble-
strewn floor Side-tunnels branch off at intervals and he
checks each one quickly as he advances

He CALLS again -- but his ECHO fragments incoherently as it
bounces away through the complex of tunnels

Now another noise -- a faint SCURRYING sound

He moves towards it more cautious beginning to have second
thoughts about being here He stops and listens the noise
is gradually getting louder

All of a sudden he doesnt like it

Turns back the way he came

Trying not to rush

but gradually speeding up nevertheless

Turns to look behind as the noise gets even louder

Then back the way hes heading

WHAM -- as a figure RUSHES out of nowhere SMASHING into him
and SLAMMING his head violently back against the wall

He bounces forward and goes down like a ton of bricks
The mysterious figure STUMBLES off blindly into the darkness

Ebert weakly lifts his battered head -- his consciousness
draining away

His torch is lying on its side nearby -- shining along the
rough floor -- and illuminating a thousand tiny pairs of eyes
which are SCUTTLING towards him

And as he finally begins to black-out
As he manages one final broken panic-stricken YELL
A hundred filthy scurrying RATS swarm over him

CUT TO

INT TUNNEL SYSTEM - SIDE-TUNNEL OUTSIDE GENERATOR ROOM

A circle of torch-light HITS Baumann in the face and he puts
up a hand to shield his eyes

KRUPP (0S)
(urgent whisper )
What the hell is going on

Krupp shifts the light away from Baumanns face as he steps
forward from out of the darkness Heydrich is with him
alert and with rifle ready

Baumann is pale and trying hard to disguise his relief at
being found

BAUMANN
Torch failed

KRUPP
Who yelled

BAUMANN
How should I know I havent been
able to bloody move

Krupp snatches Baumanns torch Bangs it against the wall
Flicks the switch It comes ON Baumann isnt impressed

BAUMANN (contd)
I tell you it wasnt working

KRUPP
Wheres Ebert

Baumann is struggling to remain patient He pulls the
diagram from his tunic and tosses it at Krupp

BAUMANN
Take a look This place is huge
I dont know where Ebert is or any
of them for that matter

HEYDRICH
More to the point -- what happened
to make somebody yell out

Krupp is behaving as if he thinks it was Baumann

KRUPP
Any ideas about that Corporal

BAUMANN
Yes Americans

Krupp is wrong-footed He hadnt even considered it

KRUPP
In here

HEYDRICH
That makes sense They couldve
got in from the other side of the
hill

KRUPP
(annoyed to both of them)
How many bloody Yanks do you think
there are around here

HEYDRICH
(interrupting)
Shhh

Heydrich is suddenly alert Puts a hand over his torch to
smother the light He whispers

HEYDRICH (contd)
You hear that

The other two catch on instantly -- argument forgotten -- the
professional soldier taking over as they pull weapons and
fall into combat readiness flattening against the wall

KRUPP
Which direction

HEYDRICH
Hard to tell in here

The NOISE comes again Feet on concrete Someones coming

All their torches are off They check both directions along
the tunnel

- a GLOW to the left illuminating the rectangular end of
their tunnel

They swing their guns towards it crouching
Waiting

Silent

Torchlight BURSTS around the corner
Heydrich SHOUTS

HEYDRICH (contd)
HALT

MIRUS
(startled)
Whos there

HEYDRICH
Mirus

The three soldiers flash on their torches Sure enough its
Mirus scared half out of his wits by the surprise They all
drop their guns blowing out their breath in relief

Krupp looks at Baumann with disdain

KRUPP
Theres your Americans

Mirus joins them irritation taking over now
MIRUS

You shouldnt be in here What’re
you doing in here

KRUPP
I should be asking that question
Private Whats going on Wheres
Kreuzmann

MIRUS
I dont know what youre talking
about I was on my way back to the
bunker Why have you been
following around after me

KRUPP
We werent
A pregnant pause
RIFLE SHOT distant then the muffled BOOMING of the

machine-gun A split second of realisation

HEYDRICH
The bunker

- then they all RUN LIKE HELL

CUT TO
INT ACCESS TUNNEL
Baumann and Krupp pile inside and RUN along the tunnel the
BOOMING of the guns getting louder all the time Mirus and

Heydrich are slower trailing several yards behind

HEYDRICH
Stay here Watch the tunnels

Mirus remains in the Access Tunnel whilst Heydrich follows
Baumann and Krupp up the steps into the bunker

CUT TO
INT BUNKER - GUN ROOM - NIGHT
The guns are POUNDING again the air choked with smoke
Neumann swings the big gun from side to side as he FIRES an
expression of excitement on his face Schenke is at the
observation loophole BLASTING off rounds as fast as he can

work the rifle bolt

Krupp bursts in rushes to help at the gun Baumann and
then Heydrich go to the loophole to back up Schenke

Schenke finishes his clip Steps aside to reload
Baumann fills his position Ready to fire

-- but he doesnt

He tries to shout over the NOISE of the gun A nudge from
Krupp and Neumann stops FIRING

BAUMANN
Theres nothing out there

Schenke pushes him aside roughly

SCHENKE
Whats the matter with you

But Schenke freezes in sudden confusion as he looks again
outside

SCHENKES POV

The wind-blown hillside stretches out below still and
empty No movement apart from the driving snow

BACK TO SCENE

Muffled FIRING continues from the Entrance Defence Room --
but from nowhere else

Krupp elbows Schenke aside to look outside for himself

KRUPP
What were you shooting at

Schenke and Neumann remain silent incredulous whilst
Heydrich heads for the door

CUT TO
INT ENTRANCE DEFENCE ROOM
Franke is sweating freely -- FIRING through the loophole ina
steady mechanical rhythm -- almost as if in a trance

Heydrich puts his hand on Frankes shoulder and he STARTS
violently shaking himself back to reality Lowers his
rifle

He looks around at Heydrich frightened and confused
FRANKE
Jesus they were everywhere
Trying to get in I thought for a
minute

HEYDRICH
Easy Theyve gone now

CUT TO

INT GUN ROOM - NIGHT

Krupp KICKS an empty ammo box against the wall

KRUPP
Used up Shooting at shadows
Whats the matter with everybody

SCHENKE
They were out there

KRUPP
Then why didnt you hit anything
Look outside Where are the
bodies

The others remain silent as Heydrich wanders back in Krupp
stands there fuming for a few moments before picking up where
he left off

KRUPP (contd)
Id expect it from a trigger-happy
school kid but you Schenke You
should lay off the pills - theyre
making you see things

HEYDRICH
Franke saw something too They
cant all be imagining it

Schenke looks at his unexpected ally curiously

BAUMANN
Theyre playing tricks on us hit
and run tactics psychological
warfare

KRUPP
Keep out of it Baumann

Krupp turns back to Schenke exasperated

KRUPP (contd)
What do we have left

SCHENKE
Half a belt for the machine-gun
Whatever rifle rounds and grenades
each of us have

NEUMANN
Theres a few shells for the
cannon

KRUPP

Against troops What good is
that you idiot

Making a decision he moves purposefully to the field
telephone Picks up the receiver and winds the generator

handle Listens

Winds the handle again

Listens

Hes suddenly no longer quite so angry His voice is shaky

KRUPP (contd)
The lines dead

CUT TO

INT CREW ROOM —- NIGHT

Baumann spreads the diagram he found across the table and
Heydrich leans over to study it

BAUMANN
Its a site wiring diagram Not
quite a map but almost as good
Look at the size of the place

HEYDRICH
Quite a prize for an advancing
army If they could seize it
intact

BAUMANN
Tell it to Krupp He cant bloody
admit he might be wrong

On cue Krupp and Schenke arrive still locked in an
irritable discussion -- Schenke firmly pushing for action

SCHENKE
- It wont be an overhead
telephone line itll be a ground
cable And if it’s routed back
through the tunnels the
implications obvious

Krupp is more subdued now suddenly less sure of himself

KRUPP
Alright suppose the Americans are
in the tunnels

SCHENKE
I say we secure the entire complex
not just the bunker if theyre in
there we push them out

HEYDRICH
With what Schenke

SCHENKE

With our bare bloody hands if
necessary

Heydrich ignores Schenkes challenging glare Schenke
continues trying to persuade Krupp

SCHENKE (contd)

If they were in there in force
theyd have stormed the bunker by

now

Its got to be a manageable

number

Krupp is thinking about it all

KRUPP

So you think Kreuzmann and Ebert
are dead

SCHENKE

Deserted or dead Either way we
can forget them

BAUMANN

Youre all heart Schenke

Schenke reacts suddenly and viciously

SCHENKE

Shut your mouth you bloody coward
You had your chance to find them
From what I hear you preferred to
hide away in the dark and do
nothing

Heydrich straightens up shocked at the open accusation and
poised to come between Schenke and Baumann

- but Baumann takes it without a flinch He glances
briefly at Krupp then glares into Schenkes eyes

BAUMANN

If it’s a scrap you’re looking for

youll have to do better than that
(calmly)

Get it into your head once and for

all Schenke I’m not fighting the

same war as you

SCHENKE
(a snort)
Isn’t that the truth

Schenke sneers at Baumanns refusal to escalate the

confrontation
back to Krupp

Grinning triumphantly he turns his attention
still pressing his case

SCHENKE (contd)
We cant let them have the tunnels

Krupp agonises for several excruciating moments
then reluctantly nods his acceptance
KRUPP
Alright But if we run into too
much opposition we fall back to
here My orders only cover this

bunker

But Schenke isnt listening -- he excitedly moves to the
diagram spread out on the table smirking at Baumann

SCHENKE
This should be interesting

CUT TO
SERIES OF SHOTS
as they prepare for combat

Electrical tape stuck across the lenses of the torches
leaving only a slit for the beam

Remaining ammo shared out equally
Equipment strapped on
Guns loaded
Bayonets fixed
Knives and stick-grenades tucked into boots
Schenke surreptitiously pops another benzedrine pill
Sequence culminates with

CUT TO
INT ENTRANCE PASSAGE - NIGHT
- Schenke hastily securing a stick-grenade to the inside
handle of the main entrance a web of wire looping back and
forth between the door-bolts and the ring-pull fuse

Neumann watches as Schenke finishes the deadly booby-trap

NEUMANN
Is that to keep them out or us in

SCHENKE
(with a grin)
You catch on quick

Neumann licks his lips nervously

NEUMANN
Let me come with you into the
tunnels

Schenke shakes his head slinging his rifle over his
shoulder

SCHENKE
No Youre more use here You did
alright back there on the gun

Neumann starts to protest but Heydrich Baumann and Krupp
appear through the Gas Lock ready to go

Franke follows looking at Neumann and gesturing back towards
the Entrance Defence Room

FRANKE
Its all yours kid

SCHENKE
(to Neumann )
And keep an eye on the old man

With that Schenke spins on his heel and leads the others
down the steps and into the Access Tunnel

CUT TO
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM

The Access Tunnel door swings open Schenke checks around
the corner cautiously before they emerge

Schenke has paired himself off with Krupp whos now even
more subdued for some reason

When they speak its in hushed tones

SCHENKE
Well go straight for the main
entrance you three sweep the long
way around
(with mock deference)
If thats alright with you
Corporal

BAUMANN
(weary )
Give it a rest Schenke

Baumann turns away without further comment and the two
halves of the group cautiously set off in opposite
directions

BAUMANN HEYDRICH and FRANKE

Franke glances back to make sure Schenke and Krupp are out of
earshot

FRANKE
I sometimes wonder whos really
running this unit

HEYDRICH
(to Baumann )
Why do you let that little bastard
keep riling you

BAUMANN
What do you want me to do

HEYDRICH
You could start by telling him what
happened back at the ambush He
thinks you chickened out

BAUMANN
I know what he thinks And he can
believe what he wants to believe

Heydrich shakes his head

HEYDRICH
Sometimes I think you enjoy being
hated
Franke is intrigued
FRANKE

What did happen

HEYDRICH
We were under fire and he came back
to pull me clear after I fell
Risked his neck So if Schenke
asks tell him

BAUMANN
Shhh

Baumann gestures for him to be quiet using the excuse that
theyre approaching the first corner Franke looks at
Baumann their earlier misunderstanding clearly on his mind

FRANKE
(to Baumann )
So what you said about all
those extra troops
HEYDRICH
If he said he saw them Franke he

saw them
(MORE )

And for al HEYjoRTemcdiheydyre in

here now waiting for us
Baumann pauses by the corner Flattening against the wall
he carefully peers around into the darkness then checks with
his torch before nodding the all-clear
They then look back momentarily along the dark length of the
tunnel theyve just covered
THEIR POV
In the black distance the pin-pricks of light from Schenke
and Krupps torches wink out as they turn an invisible
bend
BACK TO SCENE

The three of them are now on their own Baumann consults his
hastily copied map

BAUMANN
From now on well have to be
careful
The leg alright
HEYDRICH

For the moment But let me set the
pace will you I can’t go too
fast

BAUMANN
After you

They set off again into the next length of tunnel

Heydrich slightly ahead on one side Baumann and Franke on
the other side

All of them hug the wall gun in one hand torch in the other
-- the masked beams of the torches allowing only sufficient
light to see where theyre treading -- held away from their
bodies in case someone takes a pot-shot at the light

Theyre alert to the slightest sound the faintest trace of
torch-light ahead

Ready if necessary to fight
CUT TO
INT BUNKER - ENTRANCE DEFENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Neumann is concerned

The wind is now blowing fiercely outside blasting flecks of
snow through the narrow loophole at which hes positioned
Hes doing his best to keep watch but his eyes are watering
against the powerful freezing draft

Mirus enters the room behind him and Neumann becomes even
more agitated

NEUMANN
Why arent you watching the front

But Mirus no longer seems to care He appears worn out and
is now coughing badly

MIRUS
Whats the point We cant see
anything out there

NEUMANN
Mirus they left us in charge at
this end We have a
responsibility

MIRUS
(angry)
Look theyre the ones who brought
all this down on top of us We
were doing fine until they turned
up

His sudden anger precipitates another coughing fit He leans
back against the wall to recover

MIRUS (cont’d)

If the Americans attack let the
others deal with it Ive done
enough Dammit I did my bit
twenty-five years ago

Neumann suddenly starts to panic the responsibility for
everything suddenly dumped on his shoulders He thinks fast
trying to reason with the old man

NEUMANN
Look you cant just give up now
We have to do what we can and at
least warn the others of an attack

MIRUS
The danger isnt even out there
Its in those tunnels

NEUMANN
What are you talking about

Mirus looks at Neumann defiantly

MIRUS
Martin told me

Neumann cant hide his exasperation

NEUMANN
Your sons dead Mirus He died at
Normandy You told me so yourself

MIRUS
Dont look at me like that I tell
you he talks to me

NEUMANN
Youre confused again dont you
see Martin is dead

MIRUS
They just think Im a crazy old
man You all do But theres
something about those tunnels In
there Martin comes back to me

Neumann is just listening now -- something about Miruss
conviction which unsettles him

MIRUS (contd)
Why do you think Ive been going in
there for the past three weeks I
go to see him The tunnels are
like a doorway for the dead to
come back

Neumann can’t quite believe what he’s hearing -- but Mirus
continues

MIRUS (contd)
Martin told me to be careful never
to let anyone else in Tonight I
found out why Tonight when he
came back others came back with
him

CUT TO
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM

Schenke and Krupp are proceeding in the same cautious fashion
as the other three

Schenke leads the way like a prowling panther visibly
itching for a scrap and checking every side-tunnel and
chamber with alert anticipation

Krupp however is increasingly unnerved looking around
anxiously at the confined space and trying hard not to betray
a clear case of claustrophobia which is growing as they
progress deeper into the tunnels

They enter an unfinished section of tunnel water dripping
from the roof

After a few yards Krupp pauses to study the map leaning back
against the shored wall as he again loosens his collar

A CREAK -- and a stream of earth spills from the roof
SCHENKE
Christ
They freeze coiled -- until the stream abates

SCHENKE (contd)
Dont touch a thing This place is
a death-trap

And this hasnt done anything for Krupps nerves A deep
breath and off they go again

Along
Through into another fully finished section

Whitewashed walls now A steel doorway ahead and to the
right with stencilled lettering overhead MUN-R

They take up position either side of the door Schenke
reaches for the handle

He pushes the door open and follows it inside quickly
shining his torch around
MUNITIONS STORAGE ROOM

Krupp is right behind him -- and he stops in amazement his
anxiety momentarily forgotten at the sight before him

A fully stocked ammunition store abandoned and forgotten

Row upon row of wooden racks stacked with cannon shells and

boxes of assorted calibres More boxes -- grenades and
rifle and machine gun rounds -- piled in the corners Enough
ammo to defend a bunker for six months -- gathering dust

Schenke begins to chuckle like an excited child

SCHENKE (contd)
I don’t believe it

He’s like a kid in a sweet store he doesnt know where to
start

Finally he crouches over a box of rifle ammo and begins to
prise it open with his bayonet

SCHENKE (contd)
Come on help me Now we can fight
back properly Now theres no
excuse

But Krupp doesn’t quite seem to share his enthusiasm

HEYDRICH BAUMANN and FRANKE

arrive at a junction of several tunnels They carefully
check each direction

BAUMANN
We need to go left here but the
other tunnels to the right will
still have to be checked out

Heydrich massages his thigh gingerly wincing in pain

HEYDRICH
Started bleeding again

BAUMANN

Look you stay here Well check

the other tunnels quickly then we

can move on

Heydrich thinks about it for a second but shakes his head

HEYDRICH

Thats stupid We should all

stick --

Faint NOISE from up ahead and theyre instantly alert hands
covering their torches

Baumann silently dodges across the intersection and begins to
creep forward hugging the wall crouching with rifle pointed
towards the sound

Heydrich and Franke fall in at the other side of the tunnel
SCUTTLING NOISE again

Baumann SNAPS on his torch rifle pointed -- and a pair of
rats SKITTER off into the blackness SQUEAKING

The soldiers blow out their cheeks in relief uncoiling

SUDDENLY -- A human shape BURSTS from a side-tunnel ahead and
CHARGES away around a corner -- German uniform -- torch
waving wildly in its hand

BAUMANN
(startled)
Christ
HEYDRICH

Get him Were behind you
Baumann races after the fleeing figure

Heydrich and Franke follow a few yards behind covering
Baumanns back

Baumann reaches the corner

Quick look -- just in time to see the figure dodging around
the next corner

Baumann runs the length of the tunnel The other two still
behind

Reaches the next junction

Another unfinished tunnel Several yards to the left a side-

tunnel branches off -- a broken wooden barricade across the
mouth -- recognisable as the same location we saw during the
prologue

Broken as if something had smashed it aside from within

And from inside the brief shifting GLOW of a torch -- which
then goes out

Baumann gestures to Heydrich that the fleeing figure is in
the side-tunnel and whispers urgently

BAUMANN

That barricade is there for a

reason It could lead to a way out
Heydrich nods encouragement
Baumann dodges quickly to the far side of the partly-
barricaded tunnel mouth Heydrich takes position on the near
side Franke hangs back covering them both
They wait -- listening

Nothing

Baumann points his torch into the side-tunnel keeping his
head out of the way and flicks on the beam

Nothing happens No shots aimed at the torch

So he peeks around the corner to have a look

BAUMANNS POV

Crudely shored claustrophobic tunnel which runs for
several yards before curving off into the blackness A
huge amount of clutter and junk and wooden beams casting
large black pools of shadow But no sign of anyone

BACK TO SCENE

Baumann straightens up

Makes a decision
Nods to Heydrich

Sweeps quickly around into the tunnel mouth

CONTINUOUS SCREAM as someone CHARGES out of the blackness
SMASHING into Baumann and bulldozing him back out of the side-
tunnel and into the far wall KNOCKING the wind out of him

Baumanns torch clatters to the floor and the subsequent
STRUGGLE becomes a crazy pattern of shifting black shapes in
the weak yellow glow The blind hand-to-hand combat which
follows is rapid and deadly

Heydrich leaps to Baumanns assistance
BAUMANN (contd)
(at Heydrich)
Wait Its Kreuzmann

Heydrich hesitates at the revelation

- but the demented Kreuzmann seems not to hear turns and
CLUBS Heydrich mercilessly with a length of timber

Heydrich goes down -- out cold

Franke leaps on Kreuzmanns back grabbing the arm which
holds the club

Baumann goes for the legs but Kreuzmann is ready spinning
around and KICKING out viciously

- then PUSHING backwards violently so Franke is SLAMMED
against the wall and shaken loose

Baumann is into the fray again instantly BARGING into
Kreuzmann and knocking him to the ground jumping on top of
him and SHOUTING

BAUMANN (contd)
Kreuzmann Its us

He still doesn’t hear He SCRAMBLES free and runs for it

FRANKE
Whats the matter with him

Baumann grabs his torch and RACES after him Franke right
behind

They run him to ground within seconds GRABBING him from
either side and PINNING him against the wall as he YELLS
incoherently

FRANKE (cont’d)
Jesus Kreuzmann get a hold on
yourself

BAUMANN
Kreuzmann Listen to me

Kreuzmann screws his eyes shut panting furiously When he
opens them again hes calmed down slightly his struggles
easing

BAUMANN (contd)
Its us Youre alright now

Recognition slowly seeps into Kreuzmanns eyes
-» and he suddenly breaks down sobbing
Franke looks at Baumann

FRANKE
Something scared the living hell
out of him and it wasnt us

SCHENKE and KRUPP

have left the Munitions Room and are creeping cautiously
along a tunnel wall Schenke is now armed to the teeth --
pockets and belt bulging with ammo and grenades -- and his
desire for a confrontation has increased exponentially

SCHENKE
-- I tell you I heard something

KRUPP
If the others had run into trouble
there wouldve been shooting

SCHENKE
I wouldnt count on it knowing
that lot They were probably
yelling surrender

Schenke continues quickly to the next corner listens for a
second to the silence then peers around with the torch

To the right a wide main tunnel runs off into blackness To
the left the same tunnel runs up a shallow slope to the huge
steel doors of the main tunnel entrance

SCHENKE (cont’d)
Cover me

Hes gone even before Krupp can get into position

In a running crouch Schenke dashes up the ramp to the steel
doors and shines his torch over them

The huge bolts are padlocked and rusted into place A
smaller man-size doorway set into one side of the big door
is locked and sealed A mesh of fine cobwebs cover the lock

He pushes against the doors with all his weight They dont
shift a millimetre

Puts his ear to the doors and listens

Just audible above the gusting wind the faint sound of
footsteps CRUMPING through snow Then incoherent whispers

Schenke pulls away and dashes back to Krupp perplexed

SCHENKE (contd)
The doors are sealed Nobody got
in this way But there’s
definitely someone out there

Krupp wipes his face relieved

KRUPP
As long as theyre not in here

He shines his torch around the higher arched roof of the
main tunnel clearly more comfortable with the extra space
and relaxing slightly But Schenke remains alert

SCHENKE
There must be another way in we
dont know about -- a vent escape

shaft something

Schenke moves off along the main tunnel without waiting for a
reply Krupp falls in behind reluctantly as Schenke
continues his rapid left-right check of the side-tunnels and
chambers branching off either side

KRUPP
What about the others We should
wait here where we agreed

SCHENKE
We dont even know if they’re
still coming

Krupp is losing his patience
KRUPP

I still havent seen anything to

suggest anybodys in here apart

from ourselves
But Schenke is not listening -- frozen suddenly and peering
around the corner of an unfinished side-tunnel He glances
around at Krupp gesturing with his head for Krupp to take a
look at his discovery

Krupp moves curiously to the corner and Schenke illuminates
with his torch beam --

EBERTS BODY

Spread-eagled horribly on the floor Only just
recognisable Covered in rats -- and half-eaten

BACK TO SCENE

as Krupp turns away covering his mouth and retching Schenke
almost appears pleased

SCHENKE
Satisfied

Schenke heads into the side-tunnel kicking at the rats as
they SKITTER away into the blackness

Then he kneels beside Ebert’s body Reaching out to look at
the wound at the side of his head

SCHENKE (contd)
Looks like somebody --

A sudden SPASM and Ebert’s body CONVULSES
Schenke and Krupp JUMP cursing
SCHENKE (contd)
Christ
(a pause then)
Just a muscle spasm He’s dead

BAUMANN S GROUP

Kreuzmann is slumped against the tunnel wall frozen rigid
with fear -- his entire body trembling

Baumann crouches over him trying his best to sooth his
nerves But Kreuzmanns in no shape to hold a conversation
he keeps drifting off into a world of his own ranting

KREUZMANN
-- got confused Lost Mirus
Then the others started following
me Whispering to me

BAUMANN
Its alright I was left here in
the dark I know what its like
the pitch blackness the distorted
sounds I was frightened too

KREUZMANN
They’re in here They’ve come back
for us

Meanwhile Franke has been tending to the unconscious
Heydrich where he fell several yards away He gestures now
at Baumann and Baumann leaves Kreuzmann momentarily to join
him
FRANKE
Heydrichs had a bad blow Give me
a hand will you

Baumann supports Heydrichs head while Franke gets to work
with a field dressing -- glancing at Kreuzmann anxiously

BAUMANN
(gesturing at Kreuzmann)
Hes finally cracked I dont
think he even knows where he is
FRANKE
Could be delayed shell-shock
Maybe he clobbered Ebert the same
way he did Heydrich

They both glance over at him

KREUZMANN
is listening to their distant incoherent WHISPERS
but is staring beyond his present location
elsewhere

CUT TO
EXT WASTELAND - DAY

Another place another time

A desolate stretch of bombed-out railway marshalling yard
dotted with rubble and ruined sheds and disused rolling
stock

A small agitated crowd of German soldiers

Confusion

Kreuzmann terrified is being FROGMARCHED towards the other
soldiers by two black-uniformed SS GUARDS

Somewhere in the bg someone is WHISPERING a prayer
CUT TO
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM
Heydrich MOANS delirious
FRANKE
It’s no good We need to get him
back to the bunker
(gesturing at Kreuzmann)
Both of them
Baumann looks dubious
BAUMANN
Easier said than done Lets see

if Kreuzmann can walk himself back

They leave Heydrich momentarily heading the short distance
back along the tunnel to where Kreuzmann is still crouched

Taking one arm each they lift him to his feet Kreuzmann
isnt too sure about it looking blankly from one to the
other Then they try to walk him back towards where Heydrich
is slumped -- back towards the barricaded side-tunnel

CUT TO
EXT WASTELAND - DAY

As Kreuzmann experiences another flashback Still being frog-
marched by the SS guards

CUT TO
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM

Kreuzmann resists pushing backwards with his feet Baumann
and Franke try to force him and he starts becoming upset

KREUZMANN
No

FRANKE
Easy Were going to get Heydrich
then were going back to the
bunker You can rest there

They try again taking Kreuzmanns weight and pulling him
forward His eyes focus on the side-tunnel ahead

KREUZMANN
No

He suddenly goes MAD
BREAKS from their grasp violently
Turns and RUNS

FRANKE
God not again

Baumann and Franke try to catch him but hes too fast
Disappears around a corner

BAUMANN
Let him go We cant leave
Heydrich

FRANKE

Hes scared out of his mind Maybe
something did happen down here

BAUMANN
Maybe we’d better check that tunnel
while we’re here That seemed to
be what was spooking him

They check Heydrich again quickly then turn their attention
to the barricaded side-tunnel

They step through the broken barricade cautiously
Advance along the tunnel

Checking each black pool of shadow cast by the clutter all
around

A SQUEAKING NOISE now becoming apparent as they follow the
curve around to the left

Franke shines his torch down suddenly upon a carpet of rats
ahead

FRANKE
If theres rats in here theres
got to be something else

Then their torches begin to flicker simultaneously

They freeze worried Shaking their torches to get them
working properly -- but they continue to flicker
intermittently

Baumann and Franke exchange a glance then gingerly press on
being careful not to startle the rats which retreat slowly
from the advancing light

The walls here are bare not even shored with wood -- carved
out of the earth and left abandoned even before being
strengthened

» and suddenly Franke CRIES OUT involuntarily as his torch
illuminates a wall ahead

Baumann too shifts his torch beam up from the floor -- and
reacts similarly recoiling in dread

BAUMANN
God Almighty

HUMAN CORPSES -- dozens of them Ancient half-rotted and
half-mummified Suspended from floor to ceiling in the bare
earth of the excavated crumbling wall

And wherever they can reach the army of rats are feeding off
the desiccated remains

Baumann retches and backs away hugging the tunnel wall

BAUMANN (contd)
Miruss story The Plague victims

Franke covers his mouth -- a hideous realisation dawning on
his face

FRANKE
Oh Christ thats it Mirus

BAUMANN
What

FRANKE
That could be whats wrong with
Mirus Don’t you see hes got the
Plague

They shudder in horror simultaneously and involuntarily
Baumann pulls out his handkerchief and covers his nose and
mouth defensively

FRANKE (CONT’D) (contd)
Thats no good You get it from
flea bites Rat fleas

BAUMANN
Thats it fuck this place Were
getting out
But before they can even move something begins to happen

As if triggered by their own voices a faint WHISPERING
begins to emanate from all around them

Multiple VOICES overlapping

Unclear at first -- but as it becomes louder odd phrases
stand out

It is a WHISPERED PRAYER -- but far from comforting in this
context -- quite the opposite Coming from nowhere -- and
everywhere -- with no explanation

Baumann and Franke -- both terrified -- dont need to say

another word

They turn and RUN instinctively -- back around to where
Heydrich is lying

DRAG him to his feet

» and get the hell OUT of there

SCHENKE and KRUPP
are also at the receiving end of the GHOSTLY WHISPERINGS

Theyre quickly backing away up the tunnel towards the main
entrance guns aimed and ready -- backing away from the
WHISPERING sounds emanating from the darkness

Krupp is now really edgy -- and beginning to hyperventilate
Schenke is frustrated at not being able to spot a visible
enemy

SCHENKE
Theyre playing games with us Now
do you believe me

Krupp most certainly does

And as they near the main entrance another disturbance makes
them SPIN around even MORE alarmed

» a sudden RATTLING of the huge steel doors as if someone
is trying to get in

SCHENKE (contd)
Theyre everywhere Back to the
ammo dump

A flat-out RUN back to the Munitions Room the ghostly VOICES
following behind them

Schenke turns to stand and fight
But Krupp keeps going back towards the bunker

SCHENKE (contd)
Whatre you doing

KRUPP
Were pulling back I told you
before

SCHENKE

That was before we found the ammo
We cant leave it for them

KRUPP
Its too late dammit We cant
hold them off Come on

Krupp continues back into the dangerous unfinished section
they passed through on the way Schenke is still arguing as
he chases after him

SCHENKE
Weve got a responsibility here
Lets stand and fight

But Krupp shakes his head no longer even trying to hide his
fear Schenke stops determined to go no further

SCHENKE (contd)
Then I1l do it alone

KRUPP
Youll do as youre bloody told
for once Now come on

Schenke ignores him and turns back towards the Munitions
Room

-- and suddenly the WHISPERINGS are SHATTERINGLY LOUD --
seeming to press down upon them

And even Schenke COWERS involuntarily before it

FOLLOWING KREUZMANN

as he races blindly through the tunnels BOUNCING off the
walls and around the corners Enveloped by the
overpowering WHISPERS and out of his mind once again with
fear

Uncontrollably YELLING

Around another corner
-- and theres a light ahead

Straight towards it at full pelt still WAILING crazily

KRUPP and SCHENKE

turn in panic to face this new menace as it races towards
them from out of the darkness -- a loud YELL getting LOUDER

-- louder now than even the other NOISES
Krupp crouches with his gun aimed

KRUPP (contd)
Who goes there Stop -- Stop

But it keeps coming

Closer
LOUDER

Krupp OPENS FIRE

Schenke joins in

FIRING repeatedly towards the approaching figure
KREUZMANN

is stopped dead in his tracks

Jerking like a puppet as bullets RIP into him
Still being riddled even as he goes down

SCHENKE and KRUPP

continue FIRING unaware caught up in the frenzy of the
moment

But the POUNDING SHOCKWAVE of the gunfire is too much for the
fragile roof A roof-beam shifts earth begins to pour down

Schenke SHOUTS and scrambles backwards

- but Krupp is too slow A loud CRACK -- and the entire
roof CRASHES down on top of him

BAUMANN FRANKE and HEYDRICH

have stopped where they are listening to the dying ECHOES of
the distant gunfire

And then the sudden oppressive SILENCE

Baumann and Franke peer around frightened and unsure But
slowly getting a grip on themselves again now the terrifying
ghostly sounds have abated

FRANKE
This is insane This cant be
happening

BAUMANN
Maybe the old man was right about
this place

Heydrich meanwhile -- still supported between them -- is
drifting in and out of consciousness

HEYDRICH
(confused)
What is it Are they attacking

BAUMANN
We dont know what the hell is
going on

FRANKE

(to Baumann )
What do we do

Baumann looks at Heydrich his mind racing as he weighs up
fear against duty friendship against responsibility

BAUMANN
God knows One thing at a time

They hoist Heydrich upright again and with a fearful glance
behind push on as quickly as they can

SCHENKE

is frozen against the wall panting with the adrenalin rush
and staring at the nearby cave-in as the clouds of dust

begin to clear

Krupps feet are sticking out from underneath the huge pile
of rubble -- twitching violently and accompanied by an almost
inaudible smothered SCREAMING

Schenke does nothing

Remains coldly immobile until the screaming dies and the feet
lay still -- if anything annoyed that the faint noise might
have attracted attention

He continues listening to the silence for a few moments

Satisfied he lowers himself into a combat-crouch

Glides forward to the wall of rubble which almost -- but not
quite -- blocks off the width of the tunnel

Listens again -- then shines his torch through towards the
bullet-riddled shape lying motionless fifteen yards away

Silently climbs through the jagged gap and creeps forward
Reaches the body rolls it over and studies the face
Kreuzmann

For a moment Schenke is curiously unmoved by the irony of
the situation

Then he laughs

A silent panting laugh as he covers his mouth and sits back

on his haunches Laughing until tears begin to drip from his

eyes -- and its no longer clear if hes laughing or crying
CUT TO

INT BUNKER - ENTRANCE PASSAGE - NIGHT

Neumann has made his mind up He marches through towards the
Access Tunnel torch in hand Mirus trotting along behind

MIRUS
Dont be a fool Whatever the
shooting was its over You cant

help them
Neumann pauses at the bottom of the steps and glances at
Mirus with a curious expression -- a mixture of fear and
distaste

Then he heads quickly into the Access Tunnel

CUT TO
INT ACCESS TUNNEL
Again Mirus follows along behind
MIRUS

What are you trying to do impress

them Why dont you ever listen to

me you little idiot -- Neumann
But Neumann breaks into a trot -- not wanting to listen --

and vanishes around the corner into the tunnel complex
Without his torch Mirus cant follow

Hes suddenly alone

MIRUS (contd)
Alright then Get yourself
killed For what

After a moment he turns back towards the bunker But some-
thing makes him hesitate -- draws his attention back towards
the blackness of the tunnels He leans forward peering

Is that a shape in the darkness

MIRUS (contd)
Martin

His face twitches into a half-smile
- and he begins to hold a conversation with someone unseen

MIRUS (cont’d)
Martin whats happening I did as
you said I kept away
(a pause as he listens)
I couldnt stop the others they
wouldnt listen to me Tell me
whats going on

He listens again -- and the smile drops from his face

MIRUS (contd)

Oh my God
He begins slowly retreating to the bunker -- still listening
to Martins silent instructions -- his unease growing

MIRUS (cont’d)
Oh God -- Yes -- Yes alright
Im going
He reaches the door and hesitates just for a moment

- only to hear the faint sound of multiple FOOTSTEPS
approaching from the tunnels

CUT TO
INT BUNKER - ENTRANCE PASSAGE — NIGHT

Mirus jumps through the doorway and SLAMS the heavy steel
door closed behind him locking the bolts

He races quickly up the stairs turns for the door -- and
realises the booby-trap grenade is still wired to the handle

Someone begins HAMMERING on the Access Tunnel door

Without further hesitation Mirus runs for the --

CREW ROOM

and straight for the Emergency Escape Pulls the steel
hatch open

CUT TO
INT ACCESS TUNNEL
Baumann BANGS again on the door to the bunker
BAUMANN
Mirus Neumann For Gods sake
its us

He turns an expression of ghastly exasperation at Franke and
Heydrich behind him

BAUMANN (contd)
I dont believe it

CUT TO
INT BUNKER - EMERGENCY ESCAPE CHUTE - NIGHT
Mirus drags himself through the short crawl-way and into the
narrow concrete chute which leads straight up to the roof of

the bunker four metres above

As he starts climbing the iron ladder the wind HOWLS
overhead

CUT TO
EXT BUNKER - ON THE ROOF - NIGHT
Mirus pushes aside the snow-covered camouflage-netting which
covers the top of the chute Cautiously pokes his head above

the surface squinting to see in the driving snowstorm

Holding a white handkerchief of surrender in his hand he
begins to haul himself clear of the chute

Something MOVES behind him
A figure approaching quickly and silently
Mirus doesnt see until its TOO LATE and hes
CUT TO
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM
Grabbed from behind -- a knife at his throat

Neumanns eyes are wide with fear as his assailant hesitates
then whispers quickly in his ear

SCHENKE
Shhh

Schenke eases his grip around Neumanns mouth but leaves the
vicious-looking commando knife prodding into his windpipe

SCHENKE (CONTD) (contd)
What the hell are you doing in
here Were you looking to get out

NEUMANN
No I heard the shooting Came to
help

SCHENKE
What about keeping lookout you
idiot

NEUMANN

Theres a snowstorm blowing
outside We couldnt see a thing
Couldnt hear a thing

Schenke is still dubious

NEUMANN (contd)
Mirus is still keeping watch -- but
I thought Id be more help in here

Schenke lets go and Neumann looks around at him for the
first time Schenke’s face is taut with tension -- his eyes
containing the first faint gleam of insanity

Schenke quickly checks in both directions -- listening
intently to the silence -- then whispers urgently
SCHENKE

Are you really ready to help To
do whatevers required

NEUMANN
Yes

SCHENKE
Ready to take on the
responsibilities of wearing that
uniform

Despite his obvious fear Neumann replies defiantly

NEUMANN
Yes

SCHENKE
Then do as I say Without
question You understand

Neumann nods and Schenke quickly continues

SCHENKE (contd)
Theyre in here The Yanks There
cant be many -- but theyre
playing tricks Trying to confuse
us Pick us off one by one

Neumann nods again as Schenke hands him a couple of clips for
his rifle

SCHENKE (contd)
The Lieutenants dead the others
cant be trusted so its up to us
We give the enemy nothing

CUT TO
INT ACCESS TUNNEL

Heydrich is slowly coming around taking a sip from Baumanns
water flask

Theyre hunched nervously beside the sealed door to the
bunker Franke keeping watch towards the tunnels Baumann
wiping Heydrichs brow with a wet handkerchief

BAUMANN
God knows what was happening
Franke had an idea -- that we’ve
been hit with some kind of nerve-
gas

HEYDRICH
Jesus

FRANKE

Making us hallucinate Its the
only thing that makes sense

BAUMANN
It would explain a lot

But theres an edge in Baumanns voice as if hes not really
convinced Franke however is sure

FRANKE
It explains everything

Heydrich sits up a little straighter squinting painfully as
his befuddled mind struggles with the situation

HEYDRICH
And the others

BAUMANN
Who knows The shooting stopped
pretty quickly then nothing

Heydrich gestures at the bunker door

HEYDRICH
So what now

BAUMANN
Theyre not answering I think
they heard us coming and assumed we
were Yanks Maybe theyre just
scared and keeping quiet -- or
maybe they’ve already surrendered

HEYDRICH
In which case there could be
platoon of Americans at the other
side of this door listening to
us

BAUMANN
- or heading right for us through
the tunnels

Franke wipes his mouth nervously

FRANKE
Both knowing our luck -- The
problem is if we are lapsing into
hallucinations we cant be sure of
anything we see or hear --
Anything

CUT TO
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM - MUNITIONS STORAGE ROOM

Neumann is carefully piling cannon shells onto a bed of wood
and sack-cloth constructed against the base of a fully-laden
shell-rack Schenke trots over carrying a couple of broken-
open shell cases

SCHENKE
Wait a minute

He pours some of the cordite from the shell cases over
Neumanns bonfire-type construction then slowly backs away
towards the door leaving a cordite trail along the concrete
floor

SCHENKE (contd)
Alright More wood and sacking on
top Quickly

NEUMANN
What happens to us when this lot
goes up

SCHENKE
Dont worry We wont be around
here

Weve got other things to take care of
Schenke smiles with secret amusement

But as if on cue to wipe the smile away the ghostly noises
begin again -- very faint at first -- this time a distant
unearthly MUTTERING and SOBBING

Neumann crouches horrified -- hearing the sounds for the
first time -- growing pale as the full reality of the
situation dawns upon him

Schenke flattens himself beside the doorway listening Hes
perfectly calm as he speaks

SCHENKE (contd)
Theyre coming again

CUT TO
INT ACCESS TUNNEL

Franke and Baumann scuttle to the end of the tunnel peering
around into the blackness as the MUTTERING draws nearer

FRANKE
Dear God what now

Heydrich joins them like Neumann he too is hearing this for
the first time He cant quite believe it

HEYDRICH
Listen to it It has to be the
Americans trying to panic us

FRANKE
(to Heydrich)
So what do we do

HEYDRICH
Blow that door if we can Now

FRANKE
But itll give away our position

BAUMANN
(to Heydrich)
Im with you Lets try it

Baumann pulls a stick grenade from his boot

Gets a nod of readiness from the other two

Unscrews the cap
Pulls the loop of string to pop the fuse

Tosses the grenade the length of the Access Tunnel dropping
it smack at the base of the Bunker door

All three pile out into the main tunnel taking cover either
side of the Access Tunnel mouth

Three seconds four five
BLANG and the sharp deafening BLAST reverberates away
throughout the tunnels -- and even here the lined concrete
walls and ceiling seem to creak under the strain
CUT TO
INT MUNITIONS STORAGE ROOM
Schenke and Neumann listen to the dying ECHOES of the blast
SCHENKE
That was the booby-trap They’re
coming in from both ends now
(pointedly to Neumann)
Are you ready
Neumann nods pale and trembling
Schenke takes out his benzedrine pills shakes one into
Neumanns hand and tips the remainder -- five or six -- into
his own mouth
Neumann pulls out a small hip-flask and offers it Schenke
And this time Schenke takes it Washes down his pills with

a belt of booze Neumann does the same

Then Schenke crouches with his wind-proof lighter -- touching
off the trail of cordite on the floor

As it FIZZES quickly towards the make-shift bonfire Schenke
takes a final deep breath hoisting his rifle

SCHENKE (contd)
This is it If it moves shoot

He leads the way out into the tunnels
CUT TO
INT ACCESS TUNNEL
Baumanns torch bores a path through the thick cloud of smoke

and dust as he quickly feels his way coughing and choking
along the Access Tunnel

He emerges from the fog to find the bunker door dented -- but
intact

His face is a picture of despair He kicks at the door
impotently as Heydrich arrives behind him

BAUMANN
Shit -- If anything its jammed
in tighter

Heydrich joins in kicking at the door as best he can with
his good leg -- but its useless

HEYDRICH
You bastards Open up

He gives up slumping against the wall as a wave of dizziness
overwhelms him momentarily Baumann stops too

BAUMANN
Alright Alternative plan Can
you run

HEYDRICH

Not much choice is there

They reluctantly turn away and scurry back to where Franke is
guarding the doorway into the tunnels

The ghostly noises are still apparent -- and even closer now

FRANKE
Dammit that cant to be real

HEYDRICH
(to Baumann )
So what is this alternative plan

BAUMANN
Find Schenke and Krupp Find the
main entrance Take your pick

The three glance at each other -- but none can think of
anything better

CUT TO
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM

as they dodge out of the Access Tunnel doorway and advance in
a well-rehearsed manoeuvre -- Franke setting the pace at
point Baumann and Heydrich guarding their rear

HEYDRICH
This is some fucking Christmas
alright

And following them slowly all the way the ghostly

MUTTERINGS of the unseen pursuer
MUNITIONS STORAGE ROOM

The dry sack-cloth bed of the bonfire BURSTS into flames as
the FIZZING fuse-trail hits it

The flames build quickly through the tangled lattice of wood
licking at the brass cases of the piled cannon shells
BAUMANN FRANKE and HEYDRICH

Franke gestures for the others to follow as he advances
around a corner

Baumann and Heydrich trail after him still watching the
rear

FLASHES from the darkness ahead -- followed immediately by
POUNDING GUNFIRE

Bullets CHOP into the walls -- into the floor
They scramble backwards in panic returning FIRE

Take cover around a corner still FIRING blindly back towards

the unseen sniper -- until their guns CLICK on empty
BAUMANN
Im out
HEYDRICH
Me too

Franke fishes one final five-round magazine from his pocket
Pushes it into his rifle with a trembling hand

FRANKE
Last chance then

He FIRES once around the corner then they RUN for it along
the side-tunnel in which they’d taken refuge
SCHENKE and NEUMANN

Schenke in the shelter of a recessed doorway lowers his
smoking gun and quickly changes magazines -- listening

Neumann meanwhile is shaking like a leaf -- for this is his
first ever taste of running combat Schenke hisses at him

SCHENKE
Theyre getting away Come on

Neumann follows along blindly as Schenke breaks cover

BAUMANN FRANKE and HEYDRICH

They CLATTER along the side-tunnel -- stealth now sacrificed
for speed Franke is pulling ahead but Baumann dragging
along Heydrich is unable to keep up

Franke SKIDS to a halt at a junction of cross-tunnels and
checks in each direction

A moment of dreadful realisation

Far along the tunnels high-lighted as just the vaguest of
flitting ambiguous shapes -- figures seem to be dodging from
cover to cover -- in every direction And the uncanny voices
continue menacingly

As Baumann and Heydrich arrive behind him Franke pulls back
his face ashen and fearful

FRANKE
Christ theyre everywhere We
dont have a chance

Baumann takes Franke’s place peering around the corner

BAUMANN
Where are they I cant see

But Franke turns to face the direction they’ve just come
FOOTSTEPS are now rapidly approaching along their tunnel

- and Franke is moving to meet them

FRANKE
This is it We’ve nothing left to
fight with

HEYDRICH

Franke wait

FRANKE
Lets try to reason with them
They cant kill us its Christmas
day

Baumanns not convinced he pulls Heydrich around the corner
away from the approaching FOOTSTEPS looking around wildly
for other signs of threat -- his bayonet ready

Franke continues forward tossing his rifle aside and raising
his hands

FRANKE (cont’d)
Enough We surrender Dont
shoot

Torchlight BURSTS from the blackness ahead
Franke stops pinned like a moth in the glare

FRANKE (cont’‘d)
We give up Do you hear

SCHENKE
I hear

Franke is startled by the familiar voice He drops his
hands

FRANKE
Schenke Thank God Quick
theyre all over the place

Baumann and Heydrich too are relieved They quickly step
back around the corner shielding their eyes against the
glare from Schenke’s torch

The dialogue exchange is rapid

HEYDRICH
Did you find the way out Where is
it
Schenke moves the light away from their eyes -- allowing them
to see the pistol hes pointing at them -- and the rifle
which Neumann also has trained on them
SCHENKE
Nobodys getting out Not them

Or us

Baumann can tell instantly from Schenkes expression that
somethings not right

BAUMANN
Whered you get all the ammo
Schenke Whats going on Whos in
the bunker

SCHENKE
Whats going on is this Krupps
dead So are Ebert and Kreuzmann
And lacking a suitable replacement
Ive assumed command

HEYDRICH
Jesus What happened

SCHENKE
You three werent at the
rendezvous thats what happened

BAUMANN
Now wait a minute

SCHENKE
Never where you should be Baumann
But this is the last time
(to Neumann )
Take a look kid this is the
reason were losing the war

FRANKE
For Christs sake Schenke theyre
just around the corner Do
something

But Schenke merely straightens his arm aiming even more
deliberately at Frankes face

SCHENKE
(continuing to Neumann)
The reason weve been pulling back
for the last six months Cowards
who wont bloody fight

The tension is suddenly electric Neumann too now sees the
way things are heading and begins to shuffle nervously
Franke pleads with Schenke

FRANKE
Weve had nothing to fight with
Just show us the way out will you

SCHENKE
Dont worry about the Americans
Ive taken care of that But first
things first -- Time to weed out
the traitors

Baumann doesnt wait for Schenke to continue He looks
straight into Neumanns eyes and addresses him

BAUMANN
Dont listen to him Cant you
see Hes half out of his mind

SCHENKE
Time to prove yourself kid They
dont deserve to wear that uniform
Prove that you do

Neumann looks at Schenke

NEUMANN
What

SCHENKE
Do I have to spell it out

Neumann looks at the others wide-eyed -- his rifle still
pointed at them

NEUMANN
But

BAUMANN
(to Neumann )
Dont listen to him

SCHENKE
Theyre traitors and cowards You
know the law Shoot them

NEUMANN
I cant I cant just

But Schenke suddenly GRABS Neumanns hair with his free hand
and SHAKES his head violently

SCHENKE
Damn you Thats an order Do it

Neumann is trembling as he aims his rifle at Baumann and
SCREWS his eyes shut -- tensing himself for the shot

Baumann waits for it

A terrific BLAST -- RIPPING through the complex as the
distant Munitions Room finally inevitably GOES UP

The walls SHAKE

Schenke off balance lets go of Neumann and OPENS FIRE on
the others himself

Franke is HIT in the arm as he instinctively CHARGES Schenke
CRASHING into him and knocking him off his feet

Baumann KNOCKS Neumanns rifle aside and SLAPS him hard
across the face furious Continues SLAPPING him back and
forth

Another deep BLAST shakes the tunnels

Schenke is on his back on the floor scrabbling for his torch
and gun Baumann shouts to the others

BAUMANN
This way Run

Franke and Heydrich help each other Baumann grabs Neumann
by the scruff of the neck and DRAGS him away

FRANKE
Not that way The soldiers

BAUMANN
I know what Im doing Come on

And he leads them straight forward without hesitation across
the junction and along the next tunnel

SCHENKE

climbs to his feet watching as the others escape into the
darkness And he begins to emit incongruously a growling
MOAN of frustration

» as the distant explosions continue almost drowning out
the ghostly mutterings

a deep extended WAILING MOAN -- which slowly builds in
pitch and fervour into a long furious BELLOW of insane
rage

BAUMANN FRANKE HEYDRICH and NEUMANN

are suddenly running through a NIGHTMARE

Schenkes distant WAIL echoes around them and seems to
initiate an answering GHOSTLY CHORUS of horrific SHOUTS and
SCREAMS of anguish Souls literally in torment

The group is on the verge of going to pieces in fear and
confusion They scramble recklessly along covering their
ears against the SCREAMING and POUNDING EXPLOSIONS which
threaten to deafen them But then

BAUMANN (contd)
There In there

And the four fugitives race towards a doorway in the tunnel
wall ahead

- and PILE inside

GENERATOR ROOM
Baumann bolts the steel door behind them

But theres still no escape -- the blood-chilling NOISES are
in here with them -- even louder if anything

They back away and huddle together in a corner covering
their ears and screwing their eyes shut -- quite literally
FROZEN with fear -- nowhere else to run

It seemingly cant get any worse when

The CACOPHONY of noises begins to fade and one particular
voice takes precedence -- a voice WHISPERING a PRAYER

Baumann opens his eyes wide with an expression of horrified
recognition

BAUMANN (contd)
Oh Jesus It is them

The whispering overlaps into
CUT TO
EXT WASTELAND - DAY

» Baumanns fragmented visual recollections of a horrific
event

The same railway marshalling yard we saw before but this
time from Baumanns perspective

He and other members of the unit -- Heydrich Franke Ebert
Kreuzmann and Schenke -- are being marched towards an
isolated bombed-out area by Krupp and the two black-
uniformed SS guards

Ahead an SS CAPTAIN waits beside a pit which is being dug by

a large group of prisoners -- themselves uniformed GERMAN
SOLDIERS possibly deserters stripped of helmets and
equipment -- who are working at the gunpoint of a third Ss
GUARD

Some are working with spades others are forced to scratch at
the earth with bare hands -- trying not to look at the
approaching soldiers as if to deny their existence

One prisoner is already kneeling muttering the loud but
whispered PRAYER which continues relentlessly

Now the prisoners become agitated as Krupps men arrive ina
broken line beside the pit A couple of the prisoners break
down suddenly moaning muttering and sobbing

As Baumann stares down into the trench with appalled
anticipation the faces etching themselves into his memory
one prisoner in particular catches his gaze and stares back
with an expression of silent pleading

Kreuzmann has begun trembling violently He turns away in
mounting fear and tries to walk back the way theyve come
but the SS guards laughing trot after him spin him around
and frog-march him back towards the others

The SS Captain now seems in a hurry to get it over with He
passes an order to Krupp gesturing at the prisoners -- his
intention unmistakable

And at this defining moment of truth each soldier reacts in
his own way

Krupp turns to his men and reluctantly relays the order
Schenke raises his rifle at the cowering prisoners

Kreuzmann in terrified trembling submission follows
suit

The others are frozen with indecision

The SS Captain SHOUTS the order again increasingly angry
Franke finally reluctantly raises his rifle

Ebert and Heydrich remain frozen

Only Baumann actively revolts

He turns on the others knocking their rifles aside and
pushing them back from the pit

Arguing with Krupp and the SS captain

Heydrich now trying to hold him back for his own good
And during the utter confusion several of the prisoners take
their last chance They try to scramble out of the pit
Three or four even make it out A couple run for it One
rushes at the SS Captain hands outstretched

The SS Captain SHOUTS a warning

Krupp shoots the would-be assailant

Schenke turns and OPENS FIRE on the rest of the prisoners
mercilessly Ebert Franke and Kreuzmann fire almost as a
reflex drawn in by the sudden panic

The prisoners are cut down under the hail of bullets

Baumann still being restrained by Heydrich watches in
HORROR

The GUNFIRE ceases
But several bodies still twitch and moan from the pit

The soldiers stare down at what theyve done

Schenke coolly changes his rifle magazine just in case
Kreuzmann weeping drops to his knees
The others try vainly to cover up their revulsion
And meanwhile the three SS men begin to amuse themselves by
pushing the heaps of excavated earth back into pit with their

feet

As the earth spills down onto the pile of bodies the ones
still alive begin to SCREAM

CUT TO
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM - GENERATOR ROOM

the same SCREAMS which Baumann Franke Heydrich and
Neumann are hearing now

Baumann looks at the others -- and with the exception of
Neumann each returns the same expression of horrified
recognition

Neumanns expression is simply one of frozen terror

The screams diminish again to a series of quietly muttering
voices -- the very essence of which is frighteningly
threatening

Franke is almost losing it

FRANKE
Kreuzmann was right Theyve come
back Theyre making all this
happen Turning us against each
other

TUNNEL SYSTEM - SCHENKE

As SHUFFLING feet seem to approach from the blackness
Schenke turns to confront whoever it is

He appears perfectly -- almost unreasonably -- calm as he
addresses the unseen newcomers

SCHENKE
Im not afraid of you Ive gota
cross to protect me

He holds out his Iron Cross -- and begins to LAUGH

GENERATOR ROOM

An INHUMAN POUNDING begins on the steel door

HEYDRICH
Is it Schenke It must be Schenke

BAUMANN
Whoever it is they know were in
here

Baumann is looking around in controlled panic
Spies something

BAUMANN (CONT’D) (contd)
Give me a hand

A metal grille is set into the concrete floor next to the air
filtration unit Baumann takes out his bayonet and begins to
prise the grille free Franke catches on and kneels to help

him with trembling hands

Yet another huge explosion SHAKES the fabric of the tunnel
system and cracks begin to appear in the walls

The POUNDING on the door continues as if a huge hammer were
being swung against it

FRANKE
Quickly

They wrench the grille free and Baumann briefly leans into
the dark horizontal shaft shining his torch either way

BAUMANN
Alright In

Another BANG and the door shakes on its hinges Franke gets
into the shaft like a shot

FRANKE
Which way

BAUMANN
Either Just go
(to Neumann )
You next

NEUMANN
We cant just leave Schenke behind

BAUMANN
You still think hes such a hero
Because he wears that medal Then
stay with him

Neumann makes a hasty decision Clambers into the shaft
followed by Heydrich

Another HUGE BANG and the door rattles dangerously Baumann
ducks into the shaft after them

CUT TO
INT VENTILATION SHAFT
A tight fit Solid concrete No going back

Franke struggles ahead as fast as he can The others crawl
along head to foot behind him already regretting it

The POUNDING continues behind them
FRANKE
I cant see how far it goes What
if its a dead-end
HEYDRICH
It has to come out somewhere Just

keep going

A final BANG from back in the Generator Room and the muffled
CRASH of the door giving way

BAUMANN
Theyre through the door

Everybody shifts up yet another gear scrabbling along as
fast as is possible on elbows and knees Franke is beginning
to panic His torch reveals a blank wall dead-ahead a turn

FRANKE
Oh God

A bit closer Not a turn -- its a

FRANKE (contd)
Dead end Its a dead end

A string of frightened AD-LIB CURSES

BAUMANN
It cant be Keep going
Franke scrambles the last few yards -- hoping against hope
FRANKE
Oh God
BAUMANN

Up Look up

Franke shines his torch upwards An iron grille

The others pile up behind Franke as he tries to push the
grille open

No go

And now somethings coming slowly up the shaft behind
Baumann

BAUMANN (contd)
Theyre coming Get OUT

Franke and Neumann brace their shoulders against the overhead
grille and PUSH

It wont budge

Again
- PUSH
CUT TO
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM
The grille BURSTS open
Franke and Neumann are out in a flash
Heydrich next -- dragged out
Then Baumann
Half-way out when
- his legs are GRABBED from behind
Is it Schenke
He YELLS and KICKS himself free
As the blasts continue -- tearing the tunnels apart behind

them -- they run for their lives

And theyre not the only ones The colony of rats driven
mad by the explosions is running in all directions
scratching and tearing at anything in their path Their
numbers increasing as the soldiers continue their reckless
flight

CURSING and PLEADING with God for help as they go

They try to go one way -- but the roof is already coming
down
Another direction -- but a virtual river of crazed rats is

pouring towards them

They cant go back -- only one way remains

Forward into the unfinished section where they encountered
Kreuzmann -- and back to the barricaded side-tunnel

They freeze in panic
Knowing its a dead-end

Baumanns mind is racing Searching for a way out

Meanwhile the walls are crumbling
Rats are scampering wildly all around them
Jumping at their legs and gnawing at their boots

Its a living-hell

And just for good measure Schenkes insane shouting begins
to echo towards them

SCHENKE (0S)
Theres no way out Baumann And
were coming

For some reason everybody looks instinctively to Baumann

And his expression shows hes suddenly thinking again -- a
ray of hope on his face as he digs into his tunic pockets

BAUMANN
What do we have Turn it all out

Everybody begins scrabbling through their pockets and
pouches grasping at any last straw Pulling things out
Penknives bandages compasses signal flares

Baumann GRABS the flares from Franke and pulls the folding
entrenching spade from his belt No time to even explain

BAUMANN (cont’d)
Come on

And he rushes into the barricaded side-tunnel Heydrich and
Neumann who dont know whats in there follow him in -- but
Franke takes a few steps and stops Wont go any nearer

BAUMANN HEYDRICH and NEUMANN

rush into the chamber of horrors Baumann had seen before
This time its worse The tremors from the distant explosions
are shaking the earth loose from the walls -- revealing even

more bodies -- their mummified limbs moving as if alive

Heydrich and Neumann have a moment to react with predictable
shock and fear -- then their torches flicker and die

A moment of blackness accompanied by fearful SHOUTS

A FLARE shoots out bounces off the ceiling and into a
corner CRACKLING as it illuminates the chamber with blue
flickering light

Baumann doesnt wait another second Begins dragging sacks
of concrete mix against the wall containing the corpses
piling them up yelling as he does so

BAUMANN (cont’d)
Help me They cant be buried very
deep We cant be far beneath the
surface

Heydrich catches on straight away Unfolds his entrenching
spade clambers on top of Baumanns makeshift platform and
begins DIGGING into the roof corpses inches away from his
face in the wall Earth begins to shower down

Neumann manages to gather himself sufficiently to take over
from Baumann dragging more sacks over to build the platform
higher

And Baumann joins Heydrich HACKING furiously up into the
roof

FRANKE

is hovering indecisively just inside the broken barricade

Schenkes voice calls again out again closer

SCHENKE (0S)
Neumann Where are you Franke

Franke looks one way then the other -- trapped between two
equally unappealing options Hes hyperventilating Trying
to keep himself together

BASHES himself on his forehead with the palm of his hand
» and turns decisively to confront Schenke his bayonet
gripped tightly in his fist as he rushes back out through the
barricade

BAUMANN HEYDRICH and NEUMANN

Only now does Baumann notice Franke isnt with them

BAUMANN
Wheres Franke

He jumps down tossing his spade to Neumann and retreats
back along the side-tunnel whilst Neumann takes over digging

Baumann’s torch is still not working but he proceeds as far
back into the gloom as he can calling out

BAUMANN (contd)
Franke -- Franke

There is the SOUND of a violent scuffle from the darkness
Then a single SHOT

And Schenkes voice calling over the continuing RUMBLE of
detonations

SCHENKE (0S)
Franke died like a dog Baumann
And youre next
A sudden ANGER surges through Baumann
BAUMANN
Im ready for you Schenke Come
and get me
HEYDRICH and NEUMANN
have dug a yard upwards into the already shifting
crumbling roof A huge clump of earth falls away suddenly
and the HEAD OF A CORPSE swings down dangling
Neumann SCREECHES Heydrich is shaken but instantly
continues digging to one side

BAUMANN

is stumbling forward bayonet in hand towards the
approaching glow from Schenkes torch

Suddenly Schenke is there -- framed in the mouth of the side-
tunnel And in the blackness behind him -- only hinted at by
the glow of his torch -- is a suggestion of several ghostly
figures

Their muttering ghostly VOICES still unintelligible but
they seem almost to be offering evil encouragement to the
crazed instrument of their vengeance -- Schenke

Baumann is shaken to the core by the sight but holds his
ground trying to convince himself hes seeing things

BAUMANN (contd)
Put the gun down Schenke Ill
fight you Thats what you wanted
SCHENKE
Wrong All I want is to see you
dead
Schenke raises his pistol laughing

- But Baumann aims quickly and FIRES OFF a signal flare

It flashes like a ROCKET across the distance between them
SLAMMING into Schenkes chest -- and engulfing him in FLAMES

Schenke SCREAMS and staggers backwards out of sight arms
flailing -- and once again his screams seem to trigger the
HOWLING FURY of the ghostly presence

Baumann gets out of there as fast as he can -- back to where

HEYDRICH and NEUMANN

are digging upwards like maniacs Four feet into the roof
Urged on the by renewed cacophony of terrifying voices

The flare theyre using for illumination is fizzling out
-- and in the strobe-like flickering of the light the faces
of the mummified plague victims seem to come alive -- just
for a subliminal split-second at a time -- hinting at the
haunting faces of the soldiers shot in the pit

Baumann FIRES the third and last flare into the corner

Then jumps up to help Heydrich and Neumann tearing at the
roof with his bare hands

But somethings coming at them again DRAGGING itself towards
them from the darkness

Baumann takes the spade back from Neumann Kneels on
Heydrichs shoulder Pushes himself higher Digging

- Six feet upwards Hacking through roots now Earth
pouring down around him

An inhuman GROWL from Schenke as he STAGGERS into the circle
of flickering light horribly burned and smouldering

Neumann CRIES OUT
Baumann BURSTS through the roof Earth and grass and snow
spill down as the storm above WHISTLES through the tiny

opening

- and Schenke CHARGES

Baumann drops down from Heydrichs shoulder as Schenke
bulldozes into them slashing indiscriminately with a knife
and now totally insane

Baumann GRAPPLES with Schenke yelling to the others

BAUMANN
Out Get OUT

Neumann doesnt argue Scrambles up through the tiny
opening boosted by Heydrich

Schenke TOSSES Baumann aside like a doll and goes for
Heydrich STABBING at him with one hand whilst PULLING at
Neumanns legs with the other

Baumann DRAGS Schenke away Pushes Neumann upwards so he can
crawl out Tries to help the bleeding Heydrich back onto his
feet

then all hell breaks loose

The wall seems to SHIFT behind them and mummified corpses
SPILL OUT around them limbs everywhere -- which seem to
suddenly GRAB at Baumann and Heydrich Holding them against
the wall They struggle in HORROR

Schenke is coming for them again

The last flare is fizzling out
The light spluttering and dying

And behind Schenke seemingly closing in to watch the kill
is the line of ghostly figures -- fleeting glimpses of faces
and uniforms strongly suggestive of the prisoner soldiers
massacred in the pit

Schenke attacks again and a grisly three-way wrestling
match begins amidst the tangle of clawing mummified arms

Baumann is STABBED once in the shoulder Fights back
furiously partially breaking free from the grasping arms
and trying to twist the knife out of Schenkes grip

Heydrich goes for Schenke’s throat

But Schenke pulls himself from Baumanns grip -- and PLUNGES
the knife into Heydrichs chest

With a final supreme dying effort Heydrich grabs Schenkes
wrists in an iron grip -- and holds the knife into his own
chest trapping it

HEYDRICH
(to Baumann last breath)
Get OUT

Baumann hesitates for a split second -- looking into
Heydrichs dying eyes Schenke is struggling to pull the
knife free in order to turn on Baumann RAGING incoherently
Then in one swift motion Baumann grabs the last grenade
lodged in the top of Schenkes jackboot and CLAWS his way up
towards the opening above

The rotting arms seeming to PULL at his clothing
Trying to drag him back

Neumann is calling from above

NEUMANN
Grab my hand

Behind Baumann Schenke finally DRAGS the knife free from
Heydrich -- who falls over dead

Then Schenke LUNGES after Baumann
Pulling at his legs
Raising the knife to strike

Baumann grabs Neumanns hand
HAULS himself up through the tangle of tree-roots

CUT TO
EXT FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
With the freezing storm ROARING around them Neumann pulls
Baumann half-way out from the tight crumbling hole in the

ground

Baumann slumps to one side still KICKING at Schenkes
grasping hands STAMPING him back down

He rips the cap from the grenade
Pops the fuse

Drops it down the hole
CUT TO
INT TUNNEL SYSTEM

The grenade drops at Schenkes feet He KICKS it away and
tries one more time to SCRAMBLE up through the hole

But he’s tangled in the gruesome web of grasping arms And
now the ghostly figures too CROWD around pressing down on
him

The grenade EXPLODES

CUT TO

EXT FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

Baumann and Neumann are already running for it as a huge area
of snow-covered ground behind them SHUDDERS upwards from the
subterranean blast then SINKS back with a dull THUD

The storm continues to blow piling fresh snow on top of the
cracked uneven depression Slowly covering it up

CUT TO
EXT FOREST - ELSEWHERE - DAWNS EARLY LIGHT

The snow-storm has abated to be replaced by a slow silent
shower of snowflakes

Baumann and Neumann are huddled together in a shelter carved
from a snow-drift at the base of a tree still trembling from
the horrors of the night as much as from the cold

Baumann sighs wearily puffing on a cigarette as he
approaches the end of a quietly spoken story

BAUMANN
-- some of them were still alive
when the pit was filled in -- Then

we were sent back to the barracks
as if nothing had happened All
part of the days work

He sits quietly for a few moments thinking

BAUMANN (cont’d)
We told ourselves they were
Americans enemy infiltrators
But they were probably deserters
from our own ranks Better for us
that we never knew -- But in the
end whats the difference

Neumann sits silently letting the story sink in Whilst he
does so Baumann reaches deep inside his tunic Pulls out a
small flat black box

Neumann watches as he opens it up Inside is an Iron Cross
lst Class

Neumann looks up at Baumann He opens his mouth to ask
something -- but realises he already knows the answer

BAUMANN (cont’d)
Some people couldnt understand why
I stopped wearing it

Baumann closes the box PUSHES it deep down into the snow
and covers it over

BAUMANN (cont’d)
But there wont be much glory for
the wearers of those Nor any
mothers proud of their sons for
wearing this uniform If youve
any sense youll save your courage
for when this wars over -- Thats
when youll really need it

Baumann struggles to his feet with finality forcing his
exhausted aching body upright

BAUMANN (contd)
Its light enough now

He trudges quietly forward towards a snow-covered ridge then
carefully and silently crawls up to look over the top

Neumann quietly approaches behind as Baumann peers through
his field glasses

BAUMANNS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS

The frozen dirt-road and the bunker are visible through the
trees in the distance At the rear of the bunker several
green-uniformed American soldiers are milling around

The unmistakable grey-uniformed figure of Mirus is with
them An armed guard stands next to him as he tries to
converse with an American officer Hes clearly nervous
sick and confused -- but at least alive

BACK TO SCENE

Baumann pulls back from the lip of the ridge and turns to
Neumann

BAUMANN (contd)
Have you got a handkerchief

Neumann shakes his head
Baumann pulls out his own and gives it to him
BAUMANN (cont’d)
Here wave it Dont try to hide
Just walk straight down Youll be
alright
NEUMANN
But aren’t you coming After

everything you said

Baumann shakes his head

BAUMANN
I cant get out of it that easily
I have to stick it out to the end
now But for you its Christmas
Youve been given another chance --
Now get going

Baumanns voice is suddenly harsh and Neumann reluctantly
does as hes told

But after a few steps he pauses

NEUMANN
Mirus told me he told me this
was a place where the dead come

back

(a pause)
But we didnt really see anything
did we It was nerve gas made us
see things hear things drove
Schenke mad

Baumann doesnt answer and after a moment Neumann turns away
again and heads off through the trees down towards the
bunker

Baumann watches Neumann go -- then turns and trudges off in
the opposite direction

CUT TO
EXT FOREST CLEARING — DAWN

The depression in the ground is covered over completely now
All thats visible is a smooth white concave sheet of virgin
snow

CUT TO
INT UNDERGROUND

Blackness A muffled GROANING as if someone has suddenly
woken Then a shuffling panic

A CLICK -- and a cigarette lighter flickers into life

» illuminating the tiny pocket of dusty air into which
Schenke is crushed under tons of rubble Only his head and
one arm are free in the narrowest of cramped confined
spaces Burned battered and torn but incredibly still
ticking -- for the moment And unfortunately for him a
vestige of sanity and comprehension seems to have returned

It takes him a second to fully recognise his predicament

Buried alive

And as if that’s not enough
» as the horrifying realisation slowly sinks in
- he begins to hear a SCRATCHING sound As if something
beginning to CLAW its way through the rubble towards him
Getting closer
Rats

Or something else

Schenke STRUGGLES furiously but can barely move an inch
Panic setting in Can’t breathe

The cigarette lighter beginning to sputter and die
The scratching getting LOUDER and CLOSER
- until the tiny flame dies and blackness closes in

Then Schenke SCREAMS

is
