That’s why I bagged your sister The sex
isn’t what it used to be but--

from the ladies if we go ethnic

CHARLIE
Interesting

PETE
I give you “The Wheel of Ethnicity”

Pete pulls the sheet away revealing a crudely handmade
roulette-style SPINNING WHEEL broken up into sections
labeled by ethnicity

CHARLIE
How long did that take you to make

PETE
I was up all night Are you ready to spin
the wheel

CHARLIE

What does it do exactly

PETE
You spin the wheel Whatever ethnicity it
lands on you get that kid We play-act
We role play What does it mean to have a
Hispanic kid What does it mean to have a
Samoan kid This way we’re ready

CHARLIE
You think we’ll get a Samoan

PETE
I don’t know Only the wheel knows

CHARLIE
You know we could play-act whatever that
means without a wheel For example I
could just say Hispanic

PETE
I was up all night

CHARLIE
Okay I’1ll spin

Charlie gets up and inspects the wheel
CHARLIE
What is “Indeterminate Asian”

PETE
It’s Asian but you don’t know which
kind And you can’t ask It’s racist to
ask See you needed the wheel The
wheel’s already paying dividends

Charlie spins the wheel More oval than round it only
sort of spins

PETE
(clapping)
Come on Guatemalan
It lands on “merman”

LAURIE
Do they qualify

CASEWORKER

You want me to risk my pension for these
two clowns

LAURIE
There’s something about them They really
want this Have you seen the bedroom they
set up

She rifles through the file and pulls out a PHOTO
LAURIE
It’s adorable And they scored really
high on mouth-to-mouth

If it doesn’t work out I’1l1 take the

you come back in a couple of hours

CHARLIE
We’re expecting our son

Pete starts to close the door

LAURIE
I know I’m with child services

CHARLIE
What happened to that other lady

LAURIE

That other lady wasn’t entirely sold on
you but there are over 80000 foster
care children in the state of California
still in need of a home and I’m sorry
but I don’t think the program should be
limited to antiquated notions of what a
conventional family should look like

PETE
Look at you--you’re all worked up It’s
very sexy

LAURIE
You must be Peter

PETE
Please my father’s name is Peter Call
me Pete

CHARLIE

Your father’s name is Frank

PETE
Forgive me Laurie but you just don’t
expect a social worker to be so
ravishing

LAURIE
Thank you

PETE
I mean when I picture a social worker I
see an uglier larger woman who never
found a husband but needs an outlet for
her love Like that other lady

CHARLIE
I thought that other lady liked me She
sent begonias for my garden

PETE
(to Charlie)
I finally got a chance to get back there
by the way It is lovely
