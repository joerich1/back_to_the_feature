FROM BLACK VOICES EMERGE--

We hear the actual recorded emergency calls made by World
Trade Center office workers to police and fire departments
after the planes struck on 911 just before the buildings
collapsed

TITLE OVER SEPTEMBER 11 2001

We listen to fragments from a number of these
callsstarting

with pleas for help building to a panic ending with the

callers grim acceptance that help will not arrive that the

situation is hopeless that they are about to die

CUT TO
TITLE OVER TWO YEARS LATER

INT BLACK SITE - INTERROGATION ROOM

DANIEL
I own you Ammar You belong to me
Look at me
This is DANIEL STANTON the CIAs man in Islamabad - a big
American late 30s with a long anarchical beard snaking
down to his tattooed neck He looks like a paramilitary
hipster a punk rocker with a Glock

DANIEL (CONTD)

(explaining the rules)

If you dont look at me when I talk

to you I hurt you If you step off

this mat I hurt you If you lie to

me Im gonna hurt you Now Look

at me

His prisoner AMMAR stands on a decaying gym mat
surrounded

by four GUARDS whose faces are covered in ski masks
Ammar looks down Instantly the guards rush Ammar punching
and kicking

DANIEL (CONTD)
Look at me Ammar
Notably one of the GUARDS wearing a ski mask does not take
part in the beating

EXT BLACK SITE - LATER

Daniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation
room into the light of day They remove their masks and we
see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties
She has a pale milky innocence and bright blue eyes thin
and somewhat frail looking yet possessing a steely core
that we will come to realize is off-the-charts This is
MAYA a CIA targeter and subject-matter expert on her first
overseas assignment

DANIEL
(to the guard)
Are we gonna board up these windows
or what

(TO MAYA)
Just off the plane from Washington
youre rocking your best suit for
your first interrogation and then
you get this guy Its not always
this intense

MAYA
Im fine
Shes not

DANIEL
Just so you know its going to take
awhile He has to learn how helpless
he is Lets get a coffee

MAYA
No we should go back in
makes

water

Something about the strange intensity of her expression

Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation
room

DANIEL
You know theres no shame if you
wanna watch from the monitor
She shakes her head

DANIEL (CONTD)
Alright
At the door Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya

DANIEL (CONTD)
You might want to put this on

MAYA
Youre not wearing one Is he ever
getting out

DANIEL
Never

Cut TO

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

SUPERIMPOSE CIA BLACK SITE - UNDISCLOSED LOCATION

Ammar bruised from the beating is restrained with ropes
Maya stands a few feet behind Daniel attentive wary of
what is to come This is her first interrogation and she is
on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room She
looks around at the sound-proofed walls the puddles of

on the floor

DANIEL
Right now this is about you coming
to terms with your situation Its
you and me bro I want you to
understand that I know you that
Ive been studying you for a very
long time I could have had you
killed Karachi But I let you live
so you and I could talk

AMMAR

(RESISTANT)
You beat me when my hands are tied
I wont talk to you

DANIEL
Life isnt always fair my friend
Did you really think that when we
got you Id be a nice fucking guy

AMMAR
Youre a mid-level guy Youre a
garbage man in a corporation Why
should I respect you

DANIEL
And youre a money man A paperboy
Daniel paces around Ammar anger rising

DANIEL (CONTD)
A disgrace to humanity

(MORE )

DANIEL (CONTD)
You and your uncle murdered three
thousand innocent people I have
your name on a five-thousand dollar
transfer via Western Union to a 911
hijacker
He leans into Ammars ear Uncomfortably close

DANIEL (CONTD)
And you got popped with 150 kilograms
of high explosives in your house
AND THEN YOU DARE QUESTION ME
And then Daniel smiles laughs Mercurial

DANIEL (CONTD)
Im just fucking with you
Beat He laughs again

DANIEL (CONTD)
I dont want to talk about 911
What I want to focus on is the Saudi
group
Daniel shows him a photo

DANIEL (CONTD)
That there is Hazem al-Kashmiri
And I know this dude is up to some
serious shit and what I want from
you is his Saudi email

(PAUSE)
Feel free to jump in

(PAUSE)
Ammar bro I know that you know
this dude just give me his
emailand I will give you a blanket
I will give you a blanket and some
solid food
No response from Ammar Daniel starts putting on his gloves

DANIEL (CONTD)
I know that you know him

AMMAR
I told you before I wont talk to
you

DANIEL

Have it your way

(MORE )
pushes

DANIEL (CONTD)
(to the masks)
Lets go
It all happens in a flash in one swift motion Daniel

Ammar to the floor the guards pin his limbs and Daniel
smothers Ammars face with a towel
Ammar thrashes Daniel considers his next move

DANIEL (CONTD)

(TO MAYA)
Grab the bucket
Maya follows Daniels gesture to the corner of the room
where theres an ICE CHEST filled with WATER and a PLASTIC

PITCHER

DANIEL (CONTD)
Put some water in it
She dips the pitcher in the water hands shaking

DANIEL (CONTD)
Cmon lets go
The stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings
the bucket back to Daniel
Daniel starts pouring the water on Ammars face which is
now covered by a towel Ammar thrashes with rising panic

DANIEL (CONTD)
Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef
you guys met in Tunisia back in the
70s

AMMAR
(gasping for breath)
I dont know you asshole

Maya shakes her head no
MAYA

Thats not credible
AMMAR
(SCREAMING)

Why are you doing this to me

DANIEL
Youre a terrorist thats why Im
doing it to you
AMMAR
Fuck you
Daniel pours water over the towel so it hits Ammars nose

DANIEL
I want emails of the rest of the
Saudi group Give me emails of the
rest of the Saudi group Give me
one email and I will stop this
Ammar doesnt speak He cant

DANIEL (CONTD)
Whos in the Saudi group and whats
the target Where was the last time
you saw bin Laden WHERE WAS THE

LAST TIME YOU SAW BIN LADEN

Daniel throws the pitcher rips the rag off Ammars mouth
and water spurts out - Ammar nearly drowned He gasps for
air

DANIEL (CONTD)
This is what defeat looks like bro
Your jihad is over
Daniel stands

DANIEL (CONTD)
Get him up
The guards bring Ammar to his feet
Daniel shifting his persona yet again touches Ammars face
and speaks to him with the comforting tenor of a therapist

DANIEL (CONTD)
Try to understand the concept here
I have time you dont I have other
things to do you dont

Its cool that youre strong I
respect it I do But in the end
everybody breaks bro Its biology

Washington assesses that Abu Faraj

is officially our new number three -

JESSICA moves to a wall chart of AQ leadership and
repositions

Abu Farajs mugshot to number three in the line two down

from Usama bin Laden Meanwhile in the background the

riffs continue -

DANIEL
- Best man for it

JACK (0OS)
London station is already asking if
we think hes in contact with anyone
in the UK

JEREMY
Like were just keeping it from them
Jessica sits back down and gets down to business

JESSICA
The Jordanians are being really
helpful with Ammars transit papers
Jessica passes Daniel a file

DANIEL
Any imminent threats in here

JESSICA
They want the Consulate the Marriott
its low security And theyve got
Majid Kahn talking about gas stations
in the US

DANIEL
And thats a conversation

Jessica shrugs At this point she believes that it is
merely

a conversation - not a fully realized plot

JESSICA
Honestly There are six hundred
questions in there Id concentrate
on Heathrow The Saudis Does it
matter what Faraj thinks about
Heathrow How much latitude does he
get to pick targets

DANIEL
I think hell give up the Saudis
But Heathrow is gonna be tough
Anyway Anything from last night

Jd

Quetta base thinks they have a bead

on the Arabs that escaped and theyre
going to meet with the ISI this
afternoon hopefully to set up a

raid down there

DANIEL
Great

JEREMY
And Lahore reporting ISI down there
was painfully slow last night Again
Im beginning to think its not
incompetence

DANIEL
I agree I spoke to the Chief about
that Anything on bin Laden

JESSICA
(reading from a cable)
A farmer on the Afghan border near
Tora Bora reports a diamond shaped
pattern in the hills tall male in
the center of the diamond flanked
by four guards Its consistent
with UBLs movements

JEREMY
Thats supposed to be his royal guard

MAYA
Thats pre-911 behavior
Jessica doesnt appreciate the challenge

JESSICA
(CHILLY)

We dont have reason to believe hes
changed security tactics

MAYA
We invaded Afghanistan Thats a
reason

And so the rivalry begins

Jd

Hey boss I got a guy for five
thousand bucks he can set up a taxi
stand and snoop around a bit

DANIEL
No dont need him the diamond
sighting is bullshit See if the
Paks will send someone to talk to

it today And thank them

Theyre radicals

At first we dont recognize the woman with heavy makeup
walking down the narrow corridor and then we realize its
Maya in disguise

She enters a vast cavernous hold accompanied by a middle
aged Afghan man thick shouldered with years of hard
experience in his kind somewhat sad eyes

This fatherly man is HAKIM a former political prisoner in
Afghanistan and one of the CIAs most important assets

In the galley a PRISONER is chained to a table Hakim

him The Photograph The prisoner speaks in Arabic
HAKIM

(TRANSLATING)
He says he looks like Abu Ahmed

MAYA
Who did he work for
Hakim translates Then the prisoner speaks

HAKIM

(TRANSLATING)
It was mostly with Abu Faraj - they
were always together

MAYA
What did he do for Faraj

HAKIM

(TRANSLATING)
He carried messages from Faraj to
bin Laden and from bin Laden back to
Fara
Maya leans into Hakim -

MAYA
We need to ask him something to see
if hes telling the truth We dont
know if he really knew Faraj

Twenty detainees recognize that photo
of Abu Ahmed They say hes part of

hanging out in Afghanistan pre-911

(BEAT)
A lot of them say that after 911
he went to work for KSM

(BEAT)
When KSM got captured he went to
work for Abu Faraj primarily as a
courier from Faraj to bin Laden

BRADLEY
Well thats good You still-

MAYA
Yeah we dont know if Abu is on the
outside of the network - part of a
series of cutouts and dead drops -
or if he has a direct connection to
bin Laden Does bin Laden invite
him into the living room and hand
him a letter directly Or is Abu
just the last guy in a long line of
couriers so thats why everybody
knows him

BRADLEY
Thats not all you dont know You
dont have his true name and you
dont have a clue of where he is

MAYA
We know that hes important The
fact that everybodys heard of Abu
Ahmed but nobody will tell me where
he is suggests that

BRADLEY
Maybe Detainees could withhold his
location for any number of reasons
Perhaps they dont know perhaps
this Abu is just a cover story and
hes really a fucking unicorn The
withholding doesnt reveal what you
want it to - does it

MAYA

about sending a guy with a bucket to

would be too diluted

They dont make telephone calls from

who slides a big folder across his

We did a Red Team on your analysis

According to them this behavior
could belong to someone other than
Al Qaeda

to his Special Assistant
desk to George
DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
They did give a forty percent chance
that the unidentified third man is a
senior Al Qaeda operative But they
also said theres a thirty-five
percent chance hes a Saudi drug

DEALER
(reading from the

BINDER)
A fifteen percent chance that hes a
Kuwaiti arms smuggler a ten percent
chance that hes one of the relatives
of the brothers

SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR
Basically we agree with you the
house screams security it screams
someone who wants privacy it even
screams bad guy but it does not
scream bin Laden

You get the point

If you cant prove its bin Laden
at least prove its not somebody
else like a drug dealer

there you guys brought photographs

You

GEORGE
know youre right I agree with

everything you just said What I
meant was a man in your position

how

do you evaluate the risk of not

doing something the risk of
potentially letting bin Laden slip

several White House guys a General and a squadron of Navy
SEALs including PATRICK JUSTIN JARED SABER TWO SOAR
PILOTS and some members of the Af-Pak department George
Daniel Hakim and of course Maya The doors grind open to
reveal TWO STEALTH BLACKHAWKS

GENERAL
I actually tried to kill this program
a couple of times Theyve gone
through an initial round of testing
and they have excellent radar defeat -
we just havent tested them with
people in them yet
The General continues his briefing

GENERAL (CONTD)
Youll notice these stealth panels
similar to what we use on the B2 -
(pointing to the rotors)

- The rotors have been muffled with
decibel killers - its slower than a
Blackhawk and lacks the offense

But it can hide

JUSTIN
Excuse me Can I ask a question
What do we need this for in Libya
Gaddafis anti-air is virtually non-
existent
Maya looks over not sure what to say

GEORGE
Gentlemen can I have your attention
My name is George I run the Af-Pak
division at CTC and Im primary on
this for the agency This is a title

GEORGE (CONTD)
Some of us have worked together
before This is a good one Maya
do you want to brief them
Maya looks at the SEALs Folds her arms This isnt going
to be easy

MAYA
There are two narratives about the
location of Osama bin Laden
This registers on the SEALs

MAYA (CONTD)
The one that youre most familiar
with is that UBL is hiding in a cave
in the Tribal Areas that hes
surrounded by a large contingent of
loyal fighters
Beat

fq

MAYA (CONTD)
But that narrative is pre- 911
understanding of UBL
The second narrative is that hes
living in a city - living in a city
with multiple points of egress and
entries and with access to
communications so that he can keep
in touch with the organization You
cant run a global network of inter-
connected cells from a cave

Beat

MAYA (CONTD)
Weve located an individual we believe
based on detainee reporting is bin
Ladens courier Hes living ina
house in Abbottabod Pakistan And
we assess that one of the other
occupants of the house is UBL

JUSTIN
Excuse me You got an intel source
on the ground

MAYA
No

JUSTIN
No Okay so how do you know its
bin Laden Weve been on this op
before you know

MAYA
Bin Laden uses a courier to interact
with the outside world By locating
the courier weve located bin Laden

PATRICK
Thats really the intel Thats it

MAYA
Quite frankly I didnt even want to
use you guys with your dip and your
velcro and all your gear bullshit
I wanted to drop a bomb but people
didnt believe in this lead enough
to drop a bomb so theyre using you
guys as canaries on the theory that
if bin Laden isnt there you can
sneak away and no one will be the
wiser

(BEAT)
But bin Laden is there - and youre
going to kill him for me

of our own past experiences I

fronted that and I can tell you the
case for that was much stronger than
this case

CIA DIRECTOR
Yes or no

DEPUTY DIRECTOR
We dont deal in certainty we deal
in probability Id say theres a
sixty percent probability hes there
The CIA Director points to Wolf

WOLF
I concur Sixty percent

GEORGE
Im at eighty percent Their OPSEC
is what convinces me

CIA DIRECTOR
You guys ever agree on anything

DANIEL
Well I agree with sixty were basing
this mostly on detainee reporting
and I spent a bunch of time in those
rooms - who knows
Maya shoots Daniel a look What a traitor

DANIEL (CONTD)
d say its a soft sixty sir Im
virtually certain theres some high
value target there Im just not
