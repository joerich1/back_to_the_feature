MIRAGE ENTERPRISES
MACRO SHOT LIKE AN ABSTRACT PAINTING

Only one area in focus ft is an actors character box
We SLOWLY PAN to see a monocle different pairs of
eyeglasses rubber appliances various Makeups a
collection of dental applications an assortment of
brushes A hand comes into frame and removes a small
Bottle WE FOLLOW to see it is spirit gum The other
hand enters frame and uncaps the bottle FoLLow one
hand as it applies the spirit gum to a cheek We see
only a portion of the cheek Now the hands apply spirit
gum to a mer scar Again we FOLLOW the hands as they
Place the scar upon the actors cheek The ritual
continues as we watch a moustache being applied The
hands then search out the dental appliances and pick
one We study the movement as the appliance is inserted
into the actors mouth Throughout the above we HEAR
someone mumbling but we cannot make out the words
Suddenly we HEAR

you either I cant even send
you up for a commercial You
Played a tomato for 30 seconds
and they went a half day over

She knew she had to speak out
whenever she saw injustice and
inhumanity Do you understand
that Dr Brewster

VAN HORN
I never laid a hand on her
IT swear
April is weeping
DOROTHY

She was shunned by the other
nurses out of fear for their
own positions

(losing her thread

a moment)
Maybe it was the disease

(getting it again)
She became a pariah to the
dectors who found her
straightforwardness too
threatening But she was
deeply loved by her brother

Dorothy steps out of her high heels

DOROTHY
The brother who watched her
pay for her honesty by losing
first her job and then her life

She tears off her false eyelashes

DOROTHY
The brother who swore he would
make it up to her --
(in Michaels voice)
but on her terms -- as a
woman - and just as proud to
be a woman as she ever was
