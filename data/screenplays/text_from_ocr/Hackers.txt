SEATTLE 1988
EXT FRONT YARD DAY

Slow motion Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of
unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class
residential neighborhood Yuppie neighbours look on in
shock confused Two of the troops carry a battering ram
to the front door of a white two-storey house A leashed
Rottweiler snarls and barks In position their comrades
point M-16s into first-floor windows ready to be
ambushed Pan into a window in the kitchen An
attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast

Now in regular motion the battering ram breaks open the
front door The woman startled drops her spatula

INT MURPHY RESIDENCE DAY

WOMAN
(screams)
Oough Ahhh

SECRET SERVICE AGENT
(to others)
Upstairs

Troops pour into the house

WOMAN
Whats going on Whats the matter
Who are you

The troops and one or two trenchcoated agents continue
entering the house and heading upstairs still with rifles
ready

WOMAN
Hey

Upstairs crowded in the narrow hallway the troops
descend on a bedroom

WOMAN
(off camera)
Dade Dade

AGENT
Knock it down

The battering ram knocks down a bedroom door

INT COURTROOM

The prosecutor a woman of about forty gives her closing
argument blandly Shed rather be somewhere else

PROSECUTOR
The defendant Dade Murphy who calls
himself Zero Cool has repeatedly
committed criminal acts of a malicious
nature This defendant possesses a
superior intelligence which he uses to a
destructive and antisocial end His
computer virus crashed one thousand five
hundred and seven computer systems
including Wall Street trading systems
single handedly causing a seven point drop
in the New York Stock Market

As she speaks the camera pans across the court panning
down and stopping on the defendant eleven year old Dade

Murphy

Fast forward to the sentencing

JUDGE
Dade Murphy I hereby fine your family
forty-five thousand dollars

The court gasps Dades father winces

JUDGE
and sentence you to probation under
which you are forbidden to own or operate
a computer or touch tone telephone until
the day of your eighteenth birthday

Now Dade winces in fact we almost expect him to cry

Opening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family
and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and
photographers in slow motion and driving away
SEVEN YEARS LATER

Aboard a jetliner Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the
window wearing headphones Exterior view from the
aircraft of approaching New York City The view becomes a
direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city
which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips
and digital signals on a stylised computer board The
title logo

INT DADES ROOM

and at night working on his new computer His mother
calls him

Dade goes to work on OTV He closes his eyes and a flurry
of half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by
He opens his eyes His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and
then wipes to another screen Automated Record Playback
System There is a graphic representation of the
stations automatic videotape changer Dade turns on his
TV set and turns to OTV It is running a Rush-Limbaugh
type TV show

COMMENTATOR

(on TV)
so-called American Indians Latinos and
Blacks come from a genetically mediocre
stock

DADE
Yak yak yak Get a job

Dade presses a key on his keyboard The Video Changer
diagram lights up in red At the station a robotic arm
selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of
tapes The America First tape slides out of the VTR and
is replaced by an episode of The Outer Limits as Dade
watches drinks Coke and smiles full of himself

TV
You are about to experience the awe and
mystery which reaches from the inner mind
to The Outer Limits

DADE
Yesssss

Suddenly the ARPS screen is replaced by an ominous
message

DADE

He starts to type ZERO

DADE
No wait

Dade types

CRASH OVERRIDE

Dades screen dissolves into
ACID BURN

DADE

Then the screen changes again
ACID BURN

SEZ LEAVE B 4

The Outer Limits suddenly flashes off

DADE
Yeah okay Acid Burn thats enough

Dade starts hacking Apparently so does Acid Burn The
tape changer machines at OTV are swamped sometimes
fighting over the same tape The program on TV keeps
changing
The message comes up on Dades computer screen

I WILL
SWAT U LIKE
THE FLY U R

More dueling tape changers more half second video clips
Another message

I WILL
SNAP YOUR BACK
LIKE A TOOTHPICK

As the duel continues Dade types back a taunt of his own

MESS WITH THE BEST

One last from Acid Burn

YOU ARE
TERMINATED

Then his own computer confirms for him that the connection
is terminated

DADE
Shit on me

Next morning Mrs Murphy is unpacking Dade emerges
from his room in a housecoat He makes a beeline (dodging
moving boxes) for the fridge

MRS MURPHY

INT OFFICE
Dade is filling out a form

GIRL

Dade stares at her stunned The girl has a decidedly
unconventional appearance yet is a first-rate beauty

GIRL

Dade notices her lips and in his imagination launches
into a flurry of half-second video clips and art bites
all involving lips and kissing

his palm furious Above thunder roars and it begins
raining

INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR

through his mind it is a screaming woman being strangled
in an old movie He walks past Kate who giggles

Plague hits a button on a remote control and the virus -
a long haired male model - appears on a large screen in
psychedelic colors The virus speaks in a hammy Italian
accent

VIRUS
Unless five million dollars are transferred to
the following numbered account in seven days
I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson

fleet
BOARD MEMBER
Is that
PLAGUE
(interrupting)

That is the virus Leonardo da Vinci The
problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and
we dont know which ones are infected

DUKE ELLINGSON
Well then put the ships ballasts under
manual control

PLAGUE
Theres no such thing anymore Duke These
ships are totally computerized They rely on
satellite navigation which links them to our
network and the virus wherever they are in
the world

MARGO
So what are we supposed to do
PLAGUE
Well luckily you have a gifted and talented
security officer I traced the hackers call
The secret service picked him up this morning
Ill just search his files for the original
virus code and then I can eliminate it

Whats this one eat
DADE
It nibbles You see this

Dade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display

DADE
This is every financial transaction Ellingson
conducts yeah From million dollar deals to
the ten bucks some guy pays for gas

KATE
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction

DADE
And no ones caught it because the money isnt
really gone Its just data being shifted
around

KATE
Right And when the worms ready it zips out
with the money and erases its tracks

DADE
Joey got cut off before he got to that part
Check it out By this point its already
running at what twice the speed as when it
started

KATE
Right and at this rate it ends its run in

NIKON
Two days

DADE
And judging by this segment alone its
already eaten about

CEREAL
218 million bucks man

Nikon whistles

KATE
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the
fall And thats Phreak and thats Joey and
thats us Weve got to get the rest of the
file so we can find out where the money is
going before the worm disappears so we can
find out WHO created it

DADE
I know I know who wrote it
