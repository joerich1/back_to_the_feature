BLACK SCREEN
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION

The year is 1815

The French revolution is a distant

memory Napoleon has been defeated

France is ruled by a King again
EXT TOULON PORT - DAY Al
RISE UP out of the iron-grey surface of the ocean seething
in the wind towards the shore Winter rain slices the air
Ahead the port of Toulon home of the French navy A forest

of tall masted warships

The great ships heave at anchor the wind whipping their
rigging

Through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships
under construction and warships being refitted

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION
Toulon
Home port of the French navy

1 EXT TOULON DOCK - DAY

Storm-lashed sea and driving rain A great wave rises up
and hammers down As it recedes we see the figures of men
heaving on great ropes the sea water streaming down over

their faces The harsh storm light catches glints of metal
these men are CONVICTS chained by manacles heads shaved

wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched
onto them

Now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being
hauled ashore - a storm-damaged man-of-war its masts
broken rising and falling on the surge

As yet another great wave rolls over the convicts we
follow the straining ropes down into the base of the

slipway and find the convict JEAN VALJEAN up to his waist
in water chained by two sets of manacles as the rain and

spray and wind scream round him A great brute of a man
seems to feel nothing

The convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the
rope -

CONVICTS
Ha - Ha -

CONVICT 3
Ha - Ha -
Look down look down
Dont look them in the eye

CONVICTS
Look down look down
Youre here until you die

CONVICT 4
No God above
And Hell alone below

CONVICTS
Look down look down
Theres twenty years to go

The camera RISES UP to find JAVERT the officer in charge
of the convict workforce looking on his face rain-lashed
and expressionless He stands above the men on the top of
the dock as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the
steep steps of the dock wall

Behind Javert through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of
half-built ships their ribbed frames like great skeletons in
the mist

FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is
almost completed labouring in the crashing spray

CONVICT 2
ve done no wrong
Sweet Jesus hear my prayer

CONVICTS
Look down look down
Sweet Jesus doesnt care

CONVICT 5
know shell wait
know that shell be true -

CONVICTS
Look down look down
Theyve all forgotten you

CONVICT 1
When I get free
You wont see me
Here for dust

CONVICTS
Look down look down
Dont lookem in the eye

CONVICT 3
How long O Lord
Before you let me die

CONVICTS

Look down look down

Youll always be a slave

Look down look down

Youre standing in your grave

With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the
damaged ship onto the slipway

CRACK The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust
of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean
Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent
command Valjean stares back for a beat defying him Then he
drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the
great mast in his hands held over his head His head breaks
water with his bitter gaze still on Javert as he throws the
mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength

Javert nods to the guards and they begin to form the
chained men into lines to return to their prison The storm
is passing now blown by the driving wind

Javert approaches Jean Valjean

JAVERT
Now Prisoner 24601
Your time is up
And your paroles begun
You know what that means

VALJEAN
Yes It means Im free

JAVERT
No It means you get
Your yellow ticket-of-leave

He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper

JAVERT
This badge of shame
Youll show it everywhere
It warns youre a dangerous man

VALJEAN
I stole a loaf of bread
My sisters child was close to
death
And we were starving

JAVERT
You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of
the law

VALJEAN
I know the meaning of those
nineteen years
A slave of the law

JAVERT
Five years for what you did
The rest because you tried to
run
Yes 24601

VALJEAN
My name is Jean Valjean

JAVERT
And Im Javert
Do not forget my name
Do not forget me -
24601

He strides away to command the lines of convicts as theyre
marched away Valjean walks away hardly able to take in
that he is free at last

The convicts sing as he goes

CONVICTS
Look down look down
Youll always be a slave
Look down look down
Youre standing in your grave

EXT ROAD OUT OF TOULON - DAWN

Valjean makes his way up a rising track a worn knapsack on
his back He comes to a stop at the top of the hill and
there before him lit by the rising sun spreads a wide
vista of fields and towns and villages stretching into the
distance with the snow capped Alps beyond Behind and
below him lies Toulon at the seas edge As we hear the
musical theme (Freedom is Mine) we see for the first
time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope

VALJEAN
Freedom at last -
How strange the taste

Never forget the years - the waste
Nor forgive them for what theyve
done

They are the guilty - Everyone
The day begins

6A

VALJEAN (contd)
And now lets see
What this new world
Will do for me

SCENE OMITTED

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Valjean strides down the long rising road pulling his thin
coat close round him against the cold winter wind

He passes a long line of labourers working He approaches
the OVERSEER

VALJEAN
Monsieur can I help A days work

The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap

OVERSEER
Take your hat off

Valjean takes his hat off revealing his shaved and scarred
head

OVERSEER
Passport

The overseer scans the yellow paper and hands it back

OVERSEER
No work here

SCENE OMITTED

EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD - END OF DAY

Valjean slogs on up the rising track into the mountains
Snow on the ground here and darkness falling

He looks up and sees ahead a village built on a rock cliff
its lights twinkling the snowy mountains rising behind
The tower of its handsome church rises up like a promise of
refuge This is Digne

EXT DIGNE - DUSK 6A

TA

Valjean enters Digne As he drinks from the fountain he sees
a guard standing outside the Mairie

INT MAIRIE DIGNE - DUSK 6B

Valjean stands waiting The officer fastidiously writes down
the name of Valjean in his huge ledger and the name of the
town in his passport The officer signs and stamps the
passport

OFFICER
Valjean

The officer hands back the passport Valjean leaves

EXT DIGNE - DUSK 6c

Valjean walks down the high street spies the warm glow of an
inn and enters

INT COUNTRY INN DIGNE - DUSK 7

Valjean sits in the corner his hat low over his head He
eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast
meal by a roaring fire place The innkeeper serves him a
beer As he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to
reveal his wrist calloused and scarred by manacles The
innkeeper eyes him warily He discusses Valjean with two
other men then asks for his paper Sees the phrase
Extremely Dangerous

VALJEANS POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeepers
hands up to the innkeepers face A blank stare a shrug of
refusal

INNKEEPER
My inn is full

EXT DIGNE - NIGHT 7A
Valjean moves off wearily through the village As he passes
down the narrow street faces peer at him from doorways

but the doors close when he goes by A shadowy figure

follows him Word has spread that hes a ‘dangerous man

Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage he comes to a
8A

8B

stop Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his
heart a father at a table by lamplight his young wife
before him his children on either side Nothing special
and yet everything hes never had

EXT PRISON DIGNE - NIGHT 8

He stops at the local jail An iron chain attached to a bell
hangs from the prison door He rings A grate slides open

VALJEAN
Jailer Would you let me stay here
for tonight

JAILER
This is a prison not an inn Get
yourself arrested Then we will
open up for you

The grate slides shut As Jean Valjean walks away some
children who have been following begin throwing stones at
him He threatens them with his stick and they scatter

EXT DIGNE - NIGHT 8A
He sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret
Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some

straw He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an
enormous mastiff It is a dog kennel

EXT DIGNE - NIGHT 8B
Snow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road hungry
weary moving slowly his trousers ripped and bloody from

where the dog has bitten him

At the end of a road the snow-covered church beside it a
dark churchyard

EXT CHURCH YARD DIGNE - NIGHT 9
Snow-covered gravestones in moonlight Exhausted Valjean
collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the

shelter of a doorway

A lantern glows in the dark The lantern approaches

throwing shadows Its little circle of light comes to rest
on the crumpled figure of Valjean

He stirs and opens his eyes

VALJEANS POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness
Beyond it the half-seen features of a kind old man The
BISHOP

BISHOP
Come in sir for you are weary
And the night is cold out here
Though our lives are very humble
What we have we have to share

Bewildered fearful suspicious Valjean gets up and goes
with the Bishop into the house by the church

INT BISHOPS HOUSE - NIGHT 10

A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine with
silver cutlery Two silver candlesticks light the room
illuminating walls painted with religious scenes The Bishop
ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room The bishops
sister Madame Baptistine stands Valjean hesitates

BISHOP

There is wine here to revive you
There is bread to make you
s
T

trong

heres a bed to rest till
morning -
Rest from pain and rest from
wrong

BISHOP
Sit my brother

The Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire

BISHOP
Madame set one more place
(to Valjean)
Please sit

The Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair
Valjean sits and the Housekeeper lays food before him

Famished Valjean eats like an animal The Bishop says a
short grace

BISHOP
May the Lord bless the food we eat
today Bless our dear sister and
our honoured guest
(To Valjean)
Please eat Where are you
travelling to my brother

VALJEAN
Pontarlier

BISHOP

VALJEAN

No The destination is compulsory
That is where the Law sends me I
have no home

BISHOP
Then let this be your home for
as long as you need it

fq

INT BEDROOM BISHOPS HOUSE - NIGHT 11

The Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are
also painted with religious imagery Across the passage
Valjean sees the open door to the Bishops own bedroom
There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away ina
cupboard

He turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen
waiting for him He hasnt slept in such a bed ever in his
life But the Bishop is smiling offering it to him

BISHOP
Sleep well Tomorrow morning
before you leave you will have a
cup of milk from our cows nice
and hot

The Bishop turns away to go to sleep
VALJEAN
You let me sleep here next to you

How do you know Im not a murderer

Valjean laughs a strange laugh

BISHOP
God will take care of that

LATER THAT NIGHT -
Valjean lies on the bed fully dressed deeply asleep
Outside a dog barks

Valjeans eyes snap open The first thing he sees by the
light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down
on him from the painted ceiling In panic fearing
judgement he sits bolt upright Then he looks round and
remembers He gets out of bed and opens the door

There across the narrow passage the door stands open to

the Bishops bedroom In the moonlight he sees the Bishop
lying asleep Above his bed the cupboard where the silver
is kept

Valjean moves silently into the Bishops room holding a
metal miners spike which he pulls from his bag The floor
boards creak He looks down at the old man holding his
breath but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep
He reaches up to the cupboard It is unlocked The cupboard
door opens with a sharp cracking sound The Bishop
disturbed in his sleep moves a little At once Valjean is
over him like a wild animal spike raised to strike should
he wake The Bishop sleeps on The moon comes out and
lights up his beautific smiling face Valjean is thrown
He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully there is
the silver

Carefully he picks it out fearful of every clink One last
look at the sleeping old man and he makes a run for the
door

EXT CHURCHYARD - NIGHT 12

Valjean rushes out of the back door of the house He
crosses the graveyard scrambles over a back wall and hes
gone

INT BISHOPS HOUSE - DAY 13

The Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments
when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean
before him Valjean hangs his head unable to meet the
Bishops eyes

CONSTABLE
Monsignor we caught the thief
red-handed He has the nerve to
say you gave him all this

He upends Valjeans kitbag and the silver tumbles out
The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean

BISHOP
That is right

Amazed Valjean looks up

BISHOP
But my friend you left so early
You forgot I gave these also
Would you leave the best behind

The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks

BISHOP
(to policemen)
Messieurs release him
For this man has spoken true
I commend you for your duty
Now Gods blessing go with you

Silenced by the Bishops gentle tones the policemen turn
and leave

Valjean utterly bewildered takes the silver candlesticks

BISHOP
But remember this my brother -
See in this some higher plan
You must use this precious silver
To become an honest man
By the witness of the martyrs

BISHOP (contd)
By the passion and the blood
God has raised you out of
darkness -
I have bought your soul for God

14 INT CHURCH DIGNE - DAY
Valjean kneels in the church
He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it
He turns towards the altar and the crucifix above it

VALJEAN
What have I done
Sweet Jesus what have I done
Become a thief in the night
Become a dog on the run
And have I fallen so far
And is the hour so late
That nothing remains but the cry
of my hate
The cries in the dark that nobody
hears
Here where I stand at the turning
of the years

If theres another way to go

I missed it twenty long years
ago

My life was a war that could
never be won

They gave me a number and
murdered Valjean

When they chained me and left me
for dead

Just for stealing a mouthful of
bread

Yet why did I allow this man

To touch my soul and teach me
love

He treated me like any other

He gave me his trust

He called me brother

My life he claims for God
above

Can such things be

For I had come to hate the world -
This world that always hated me

Take an eye for an eye

Turn your heart into stone

This is all I have lived for

This is all I have known

One word from him and Id be back

Beneath the lash upon the rack

Instead he offers me my freedom

VALJEAN (contd)
I feel my shame inside me like a
knife
He told me that I have a soul
How does he know
What spirit comes to move my
life
Is there another way to go

Slowly he examines the yellow passport and raises it high
as if to the altar

VALJEAN
I am reaching but I fall
And the night is closing in
As I stare into the void -
To the whirlpool of my sin

Valjean stands and turns walking fast to the door of the
church

VALJEAN
Ill escape now from that world -
From the world of Jean Valjean
Jean Valjean is nothing now

EXT CHURCH DIGNE - DAY 15

Valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and
reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory Below lies
the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley
below

VALJEAN
Another story must begin

He rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces
out over the valley The scraps flutter in the wind

FOLLOW the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind
then fall away into the void below One scrap of paper
dances upwards in the sunlight We follow this and
accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne
far below towards the sun gloriously breaking through the
heavens with the alps beyond The camera then starts to
tumble back down through mist and cloud below - through
time and space - down to discover -

16A

EXT ROAD TO MONTREUIL - DAY 16

The camera hurtling towards three horses riding down a long
muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of
Montreuil-sur-Mer Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out
to the sea We see ships sitting in low tide on the mud of
the estuary along the dockside of the town and red brick
factory buildings

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION
Eight years later
Montreuil-sur-Mer 1823

The camera closes in to ground level to reveal the
horseriders

Javert flanked by two policemen

EXT GATES TO MONTREUIL - DAY 16A

As the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered
around the gates - destitute and sick people clammering to
get in

BEGGARS CHORUS
At the end of the day youre
another day older
And thats all you can say for
the life of the poor
Its a struggle Its a war
And theres nothing that anyones
giving
One more day standing about -
What is it for
One day less to be living

Javert sees the destitution of the people Expressionless
as ever

BEGGARS CHORUS
At the end of the day youre
another day colder
And the shirt on your back
doesnt keep out the chill
And the righteous hurry past
They dont hear the little ones
crying

19A
19A

And the plague is coming on fast
Ready to kill -
One day nearer to dying

TRACK PAST a plague victim wrapped in a shroud being thrown
onto a cart

The police enter the harbour

EXT HARBOUR - MONTREUIL - DAY 17

The beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for
the police

BEGGARS CHORUS
At the end of the day theres
another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is
waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm thatll break any
second
Theres a hunger in the land
Theres a reckoning still to be
reckoned
And theres gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day

Javert looks round at the factory buildings the boats in
the harbour the poor clamouring behind him and rides on

SCENE OMITTED

EXT FACTORY YARD MONTREUIL - DAY

Heavy carts wait to be loaded with wooden crates of goods
Workmen carry the crates out of the factory as the FOREMAN
strides in through the doors gesturing to a cart driver
FAUCHELEVENT whos taking a quick rest on a crate

INT FACTORY MONTREUIL - MENS SECTION - DAY

The foreman passes men packing boxes on tables and loading
boxes onto crates He passes through a door under a first
floor office

20-22 INT FACTORY MONTREUIL - WOMENS SECTION - DAY 20-22

The long work space is full of tables at which
conservatively dressed women are working making jewelry
out of shellac a black resin which looks like jet An
impressive sight obviously a very successful business A
wooden staircase climbs one wall to a glass-windowed
business office The figure of a man within

FOREMAN
(flirtatiously to women)
At the end of the day you get
nothing for nothing
Sitting flat on your bum doesnt
buy any bread

FACTORY WOMAN 4
There are children back at home -

FACTORY WOMAN 2

And the children have got to be
fed

FACTORY WOMAN 7
And youre lucky to be in a job -

The Foreman has stopped beside FANTINE a pretty young woman
As he leans over to whisper in her ear Fantine surprised
pricks her finger with her needle

FOREMAN
(quietly to Fantine)
And in a bed

FACTORY WOMAN 8
(to Fantine as a warning)
And were counting our blessings

The Foreman continues his rounds encouraging the women to
speed up their work

FOREMAN
At the end of the day just be glad
to be working
For a master who cares for the
lives of the poor
FACTORY WOMAN 7
Hes a riddle

FACTORY WOMAN 4
Hes no fool

FACTORY WOMAN 6
Hes the answer to anyones prayer

FACTORY WOMAN 8
And he paid for the brand new
school

FACTORY WOMAN 4
Its no wonder they made him the
mayor

FACTORY WOMEN
Bless the man who leads the way
At the end of the day

They get on with their tasks all glancing up at the boss in
the office above

The Foreman returns to Fantine trying to help her

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
Have you seen how the foreman is
fuming today
With his terrible breath and his

wandering hands

FACTORY WOMAN 3
Its because little Fantine wont
give him his way

FACTORY WOMAN 5
Take a look at his trousers
youll see where he stands

FACTORY WOMAN 2
And the boss he never knows
That the foreman is always on
heat

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
If Fantine doesnt look out
Watch how she goes
Shell be out on the street
The Foreman rings a bell announcing the end of the work day

The women start to take off their overalls and pack up their
tools for the day

FACTORY WOMENFOREMAN
At the end of the day its another
day over
With enough in your pocket to last
for a week
Pay the landlord pay the shop
Keep on working as long as youre
able
Keep on working till you drop
Or its back to the crumbs off the
table
Well youve got to pay your way
At the end of the day

The women queue up to be paid by the Foreman at the door

Fantine has taken out a letter The main factory woman
snatches the letter away from Fantine

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
And what have we here little
innocent sister

The letter is passed surreptitiously down the line of women
workers

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
Come on Fantine lets have all
the news
(reading)
“Dear Fantine you must send us
more money
Your child needs a doctor
Theres no time to lose

FANTINE
Give that letter to me
It is none of your business
With a husband at home
And a bit on the side
Is there anyone here
Who can swear before God
She has nothing to fear
She has nothing to hide
The main factory woman starts to take Fantines letter over
to the Foreman

Fantine tries to get the letter back The women scuffle

The owner enters the factory floor We see him only from
behind a well-dressed prosperous man

VALJEAN
What is this fighting all about
Will someone tear these two
apart
This is a factory not a circus

As he sings the CAMERA MOVES ROUND to discover him Clean-
shaven well-fed transformed its Valjean

VALJEAN
Now come on ladies settle down
I run a business of repute

Suddenly Valjean sees Javert appear on the first floor
balcony of his office His world drops away

VALJEAN
(to the foreman)
Deal with this Foreman
Be as patient as you can

He walks back to the stairs up to his office
On the factory floor -

FOREMAN
Now someone say how this began

The factory women all turn on Fantine

FANTINEFACTORY WOMAN 5
At the end of the day shes the
one who began it

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
Theres a kid that shes hiding
in some little town

FACTORY WOMAN 5

Theres a man she has to pay

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
You can guess how she picks up
the extra -

You can bet shes earning her

keep

Sleeping around

And the boss wouldnt like it

FANTINE
Yes its true theres a child
And the child is my daughter
And her father abandoned us
Leaving us flat
Now she lives with an innkeeper
man and his wife
And I pay for the child
Whats the matter with that

Fantine continues to defend herself to the Foreman as the
women sing -

FACTORY WOMEN
At the end of the day shell be
nothing but trouble
And theres trouble for all when
theres trouble for one
While were earning our daily
bread
Shes the one with her hands in
the butter -
You must send the slut away
Or were all going to end in the
gutter
And its us wholl have to pay
At the end of the day

The Foreman pulls Fantine away

FOREMAN
I might have known the bitch
could bite
I might have known the cat had
claws
I might have guessed your little
secret

Ah yes the virtuous Fantine
Who keeps herself so pure and
clean -

Youd be the cause I had no
doubt

Of any trouble hereabout

You play a virgin in the light
But need no urging in the night

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
Shes been laughing at you

While shes having her men

FACTORY WOMEN
Shell be nothing but trouble
again and again

FACTORY WOMAN 5
You must sack her today

FACTORY WOMEN
Sack the girl today

FOREMAN
Right my girl On your way

Below Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office
above with a pitiful cry

FANTINE
Msieur Mayor help me I have a
child

Valjean hears the cry but he has other concerns He turns
round to face Javert

Javert stares at him

On the factory floor below the Foreman hustles Fantine
out as she struggles against him

INT FACTORY OFFICE - DAY
Javert bows

JAVERT
introduce myself
nspector of Police
ve come to take the watch
m here to keep the peace
Please know me as Javert

m here at your command
With honour due to each
With justice in our hands
No mans beyond our reach
Let all beware

VALJEAN
Welcome sir
Come guard our laws
Im sure were here
In common cause

Javert turns to look through the high window onto the mens
factory floor below The last men are leaving for the day

JAVERT
Youve done the city proud
Youve raised their banner high

JAVERT (contd)
You manufacture gems
That anyone can buy
Your people thrive

Valjean shows some demonstration samples of their work
VALJEAN
The dignity of toil

To stay alive

Javert is puzzled Hes sure he recognises Valjean but
from where

JAVERT
It seems to me
We may have met
Valjean throws him a sharp glance
VALJEAN
Your face is not a face

I would forget

A CRASH from outside in the yard - shouts -

EXT TRACK LEADING TO FACTORY MONTREUIL - DAY

Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and
down the muddy track beyond to discover -

A heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver -
Fauchelevent the worker seen before taking a rest ona
crate

The cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart
off the crushed man but its too heavy and the ground is

too soft Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in

the mud

Valjean Javert and Javerts assistant all hurry to help
but they cant get a proper purchase in the spongy ground
All the time the cart is sinking further pushing
Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him
Then Valjean sees a way At one end the wheels of the cart
have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here He throws
himself under the cart at this higher end and braces
himself to lift it from beneath

VALJEAN
Get back It may fall

FOREMAN
No Monsieur le Mayor

CROWD
Itll kill you as well

Javert stands back and looks on As he looks we see a
memory stirring in him

JAVERTS POV - Valjeans posture beneath the cart is
exactly the same as the convict beneath the fallen mast
The same crouching power The same almost-suicidal
determination

Valjean sees Javert looking at him and knows exactly what
hes thinking For a moment he hesitates Then he hears
Fauchelevents choking scream as the mud gags his mouth
Valjean strains every muscle and slowly one end of the
cart begins to rise As soon as it clears the crushed and
gasping man the others pull him clear

Valjean lets the cart down again and climbs out As he
brushes himself down he finds Javert staring at him

JAVERT
Can this be true
I dont believe what I see
A man your age
To be as strong as you are
A memory stirs
You make me think of a man
From years ago
A man who broke his parole
He disappeared

He shakes his head realising how absurd his suspicions

are

JAVERT
Forgive me sir
I would not dare -

VALJEAN
Say what you must
Dont leave it there

Valjean holds Javerts gaze challenging him to say more
Javert is not yet confident enough to continue

Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent

VALJEAN
Let me help you up

Fauchelevent groans as he rises

FAUCHELEVENT
Monsieur le Mayor you come from
God
You are a saint

VALJEAN
No more cart driving for you

Javert stares He cant rid himself of his suspicion

JAVERT
Monsieur le Mayor

He draws himself up and gives a bow As he walks away he
discusses something with his assistant

EXT HARBOUR MONTREUIL - NIGHT 25

Fantine makes her way to the harbour wall Beggars shelter in
the tunnels under the red brick buildings

EXT RED LIGHT DISTRICT MONTREUIL - NIGHT 26

Fantine makes her way down wet slimy steps This leads to an
alleyway that runs down to the harbour and three ships lying
on the mud at low tide At the far end the largest is the
rotting hulk of a vast old warship A single whore sits ina
doorway

FANTINE
Excuse me is this where the
Pawnbrokers is

WHORE 1
(pointing)
Its just there

FANTINE
Thank you

Drunken sailors spill out into the alleyway below The
first sailor is trying to find the whorehouse

SAILOR 1
I smell women
Smellem in the air
Think Ill drop my anchor
In that harbour over there

They spot Fantine mistaking her for a whore Fantine presses
on down the steps trying to ignore the sailors

SAILOR 2
Lovely ladies
Love ‘em till your broke
Seven months at sea can make you
Hungry for a poke

The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows
of warehouse doorways

SAILOR 3
Even stokers need a little stoke

A man with no legs reacting to the sailors cranks up an
organ-grinder and from doorways and overhead windows
harbour whores appear and tout for business

A man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear
fragments of his sales pitch

WHORES TOOTH MAN

During the above chorus Fantine sells a locket containing a
cutting of Cosettes hair to the pawnbroker

PAWNBROKER
Hello sweetheart Ill give you
four francs

FANTINE
Its worth at least ten

The pawnbroker goes back in his shop and Fantine watches the
whores

FANTINE
Alright five

The pawnbroker takes the locket in exchange for the money

An old woman leers at Fantine from the shadows beckoning
She approaches Fantine reaching out to stroke her hair

HAIR CRONE

FANTINE

HAIR CRONE

FANTINE

Cosette

The hair crone leads Fantine down to her shop at the base of
the stairs

Fantine is sat on a low stool She bows her head before the
hair crone who at once whips out a razor blade and cuts
off her hair at the roots

26A EXT RED LIGHT DISTRICT MONTREUIL - END OF DAY 26A

Fantine walks down the steps with short hair mocked by the
voices of the whores on either side

A PIMP and the HEAD WHORE watch her progress as the organ-
grinder grinds out the music

Whores sing from the warehouse doorways from on top of the
spars of the ships writhing around figureheads and from the
rotting ship

The few men in the street choose their whores and disappear
by the end of the chorus

WHORES TOOTH MAN

Fantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore

TOOTH MAN HEAD WHORE

Fantine heads to the tooth man

TOOTH MAN

The clear advantage of youth

HEAD WHORE

TOOTH MAN

She grabs Fantines cheeks and forces open her mouth to
inspect her teeth

TOOTH MAN
I do it fast

The pimp pushes her down

FANTINE
Youll pay me first
What I am due

TOOTH MAN

She opens her mouth and the pincers go in as everyone
gathers round to watch Fantine screams as the first tooth
is removed
26B EXT RED LIGHT DISTRICT MONTREUIL - NIGHT 26B

Fantine looks up a trickle of blood in one corner of her
mouth The whores cluster round her hands reaching out to
draw her in to their world On the rotting warship more

The whores perform for the benefit of Fantine on the orders
of the head whore as the head whore leads her towards the
hulk

WHORES

Harbour rats and alley cats
And every kind of scum

The pimp leads the captain down the middle of the whores to
Fantine who wears a filthy white dress The pimp joins the
captain and Fantines hands as the head whore officiates -
like a twisted wedding ceremony

WHORES
Lovely ladies
Going for a song

Fantine puts on a show of courage as she leads the captain

into the ships hulk which is a brothel

girl who cant refuse

27 INT ROTTING SHIPS HULK MONTREUIL - NIGHT

Fantine pale and frail her bodice loosened leads the
captain down to the damp dregs of the ship

We see the rotting straw mattress within as they enter

then Fantine lays down

FANTINE
Easy money lying on a bed
Just as well they never see
The hate thats in your head
Dont they know theyre making love
To one already dead

INT ROTTING SHIPS HULK MONTREUIL - NIGHT 28

CLOSE ON a mans hand leaving money We hear him exit MOVE
TO FIND Fantine lying alone on the mattress

She pulls

herself into a sitting position against the head

of the mattress She draws her legs up and wraps her arms

round her

nees huddling against the misery of the world

FANTINE

-

iPS

ip Po

dreamed a dream in time gone
by
When hope was high

And life worth living

dreamed that love would never
die

dreamed that God would be
forgiving

FANTINE (contd)

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and
wasted

There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder

As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side

He filled my days with endless
wonder

He took my childhood in his
stride

But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dream hell come to
me

That we will live the years
together

But there are dreams that cannot
be

And there are storms we cannot
weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell Im
living -

So different now from what it
seemed

Now life has killed the dream I
dreamed

As she ends her song her next customer is waiting The head
whore beyond

EXT RED LIGHT DISTRICT MONTREUIL - NIGHT 29

Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside
shivering waiting for trade She looks pale and sickly
but still attempts an alluring smile

She moves past the anchored ships beneath the bowsprits
trying pathetically to attract custom Then she comes to a
stop staring She has seen and recognised Valjean some
way off Hes out in the harbour district He is talking to
a beggar Before he moves on he hands over some money

As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy a well-
dressed young man BAMATABOIS comes up to her He arrives
with two friends and a valet

BAMATABOIS
Heres something new I think
Ill give it a try
Come closer you I like to see
what I buy

The usual price

For just one slice of your pie

FANTINE
I dont want you No No
Msieur Let me go

BAMATABOIS
Is this a trick I wont pay
more

FANTINE

No not at all

BAMATABOIS
Youve got some nerve you little
slut
Youve got some gall
Its the same with a tart as it is
with a grocer
The customer sees what he gets in
advance
Its not for the whore to say yes
sir or no sir
Its not for the harlot to pick and
to choose or to lead me a dance

He pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down
her cleavage Fantine reacts with fury They fall over in the
snow and Bamatabois laughs

FANTINE
Tll kill you you bastard
Try any of that
Even a whore who has gone to the
bad
Wont be had by a rat

Fantine scratches Bamatabois across the face Bamatabois
touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers His
friends drag Fantine against the harbour wall

BAMATABOIS

(furious but aroused)
By Christ youll pay for what
youve done
This rat will make you bleed
youll see
I guarantee Ill make you suffer
For this disturbance of the peace
For this insult to life and
property

Bamatabois suddenly sees that police have arrived

FANTINE
I beg you dont report me sir
Ill do whatever you may want

BAMATABOIS
Make your excuse to the police

Bamatabois friend drags Fantine towards the police Its

Javert

JAVERT
Who saw what and why and where
Let him give a full description
Let him answer to Javert

Let one speak who saw it all
Who laid hands on this good man

BAMATABOIS
Javert would you believe it

You can see shes left her mark

He shows the blood Javert turns to Fantine

JAVERT
She will answer for her actions
When you make a full report
You may rest assured Msieur
That she will answer to the
court

Tell me quickly whats the story

Fantine is almost fainting with fear still racked with

occasional spasms of coughing Unseen by her

Valjean is

approaching from behind Javerts assistants pick Fantine
up Javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he

approaches Fantine

FANTINE
Theres a child who sorely needs

JAVERT

tears

Javert indicates to the two policemen to

Valjean steps out of the shadows

VALJEAN
A moment of your time Javert
I do believe this womans tale

JAVERT
Monsieur le Mayor

VALJEAN
Youve done your duty Let her

JAVERT
Monsieur le Mayor

Javert looks on containing his anger as
out a hand to Fantine To Fantine its as if hes come to
her in a dream -

FANTINE
Can this be

VALJEAN
Where will she end -
This child without a friend

VALJEAN
Ive seen your face before
Show me some way to help you

Valjean reaches

looking into her face
How have you come to grief
In such a place as this

FANTINE
Msieur dont mock me now I
pray

pride
You let your foreman send me
away

Yes you were there
And turned aside
I never did no wrong

VALJEAN

FANTINE

VALJEAN

FANTINE
If theres a God above -

VALJEAN
Had I only known then

FANTINE

VALJEAN

Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms
Javert is quietly coldly furious

JAVERT

FANTINE

VALJEAN

FANTINE

JAVERT
Monsieur le Mayor

VALJEAN

after them

EXT POLICE STATION MONTREUIL - DAY 30

VALJEAN
dont understand
What is this crime Javert

JAVERT
I mistook you for a convict

I have made a false report
Now I learn theyve caught the
culprit -

Hes about to face the court

Valjean conceals his shock

JAVERT
And of course the thief denies
it
Youd expect that from a con
But he couldnt run for ever
No not even Jean Valjean

VALJEAN
You say this man denies it all
And gives no sign of
understanding or repentance
You say this man is going to
trial

And that hes sure to be returned

to serve his sentence

JAVERT
He will pay and so must I
Press charges against me sir

VALJEAN
You have only done your duty
Its a minor sin at most
All of us have been mistaken

Youll return sir to your post

JAVERT
Must I do as you say

VALJEAN
Its your duty to obey

Javert is about to protest again but Valjean raises one

commanding hand to indicate his decision is made

gives an abrupt bow and departs

Javert

Left alone Valjean paces his office deeply disturbed

VALJEAN
They think that man is me -
Without a second glance
This stranger they have found -
This man could be my chance

Why should I save his hide
Why should I right this wrong
When I have come so far

And struggled for so long

If I speak I am condemned
If I stay silent I am damned

He goes out onto the balcony that looks down on the empty
factory

VALJEAN
I am the master of hundreds of
workers -
They all look to me
Can I abandon them
How would they live
If I am not free

If I speak they are condemned
If I stay silent I am damned

Valjean hesitates outside the courtroom and in the lobby of

Valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the
courtroom

Fantine lies in bed delirious She is dressed in pure
white Her eyes are closed

FANTINE
Cosette its turned so cold
Cosette its past your bedtime
Youve played the day away
And soon it will be night

Fantines eyes open and she sees Cosette playing in the
room She looks healthy and is dressed prettily

Come to me Cosette the light is
fading

FANTINE (contd)
Dont you see the evening star
appearing
Come to me and rest against my
shoulder
How fast the minutes fly away and
every minute colder

Valjean enters and sees at once that Fantine is close to
the end He drops to his knees by her bed

VALJEAN
Dear Fantine Cosette will be
here soon
Dear Fantine she will be by your
side

FANTINE
(trying to get out of bed)
Come Cosette the night has grown
so cold

VALJEAN
(putting her back in bed)
Be at peace Be at peace ever
more

FANTINE
My Cosette -

VALJEAN
- shall live in my protection

FANTINE
Take her now

She pushes into his hand a scrap of paper on which shes
written her wishes

VALJEAN
Your child will want for nothing

FANTINE
Good msieur you come from God
in heaven

VALJEAN
And none shall ever harm Cosette
as long as I am living

Fantine has stopped looking towards the window All her
fading strength is now directed towards Valjean She tries
to reach up to him

FANTINE
Take my hand

The night grows ever colder

VALJEAN
Then I will keep you warm

He wraps her in his arms

FANTINE
Take my child
I give her to your keeping

VALJEAN
Take shelter from the storm

FANTINE
For Gods sake please stay till
I am sleeping
And tell Cosette I love her
And Ill see her when I wake

Fantine starts to spasm She sees something over Valjeans
shoulder Valjean doesnt realise Her eyes go glassy as
she passes away Valjean then hears the unforgettable voice
of Javert behind him

JAVERT
Valjean at last
We see each other plain
“Msieur le Mayor
Youll wear a different chain

Valjean stands to face Javert

VALJEAN
Before you say another word
Javert
Before you chain me up like a
slave again
Listen to me There is something
must do

This woman leaves behind a
suffering child

There is none but me who can

intercede -

n mercys name three days are
all I need

Then Ill return I pledge my
word

Then Ill return
Javert draws his sword and aims it at Valjean

JAVERT
You must think me mad
Ive hunted you across the years
Men like you can never change -
A man such as you

Valjean breaks a section of timber beam from the roof

The men start to circle each other
They sing at the same time duelling in song

VALJEAN
Believe of me what you will
There is a duty that Im sworn to
do
You know nothing of my life -
All I did was steal some bread
You know nothing of the world -
You would sooner see me dead
But not before I see this justice
done

JAVERT
Men like me can never change
Men like you can never change
No 24601
My duty is to the law
You have no rights
Come with me 24601

The two men fight

VALJEAN
I am warning you Javert
Im a stronger man by far
There is power in me yet
My race is not yet run

JAVERT
Now the wheel has turned around -
Jean Valjean is nothing now
Dare you talk to me of crime
And the price you had to pay
Every man is born in sin
Every man must choose his way

Javert disarms Valjean and drives him backwards towards an
attic door

You know nothing of Javert

I was born inside a jail

I was born with scum like you
I am from the gutter too

Valjean is pushed through the doors out onto a wooden
loading platform beneath a hoist Below the walls of the
factory lead straight down to the black sea at high tide
Javert is triumphant

Valjean glances down and pushes back dropping into the
darkness of the ocean

Javert goes to jump after him and cannot bring himself to do
it

Javert stares into the black sea - there is no sign of
Valjean

34A EXT HARBOUR MONTREUIL - NIGHT

Javert and various police search the harbourside with
lanterns

Valjean dripping wet watches from a tunnel under a factory
as Fantines body wrapped in a shroud is dumped on a cart

They sing to themselves continuing their duet without
knowing

VALJEAN
And this I swear to you tonight -

JAVERT

There is no place for you to

hide

VALJEAN
Your child will live within my
care -

JAVERT

Wherever you may hide away -

EXT MONTFERMEIL - DUSK

The village street is bright with booths set up for a Frost
Fair Families and visitors are out buying baubles or
laughing at the antics of travelling players Small girls
cluster round a stall that displays prettily-dressed dolls
Amongst them is a prettily-dressed girl of 8 or 9 years
EPONINE

Across the road from this stall stands a shabby inn A

sign lashed to an old cart swinging in the wind reveals the
inn to be “The Sergeant of Waterloo The inn is still
closed despite the small crowd at the fair

MOVE IN on the frosted window of the inn through which we
see a little girl COSETTE gazing out at the display of
dolls

INT INN MONTFERMEIL - END OF DAY 36

Cosette is in the process of sweeping the floor Shes come
to a stop gazing out of the window mesmerized by the
sight of the most beautiful doll in the display and
jealous that Eponine can see it and touch it up close

COSETTE
There is a castle on a cloud
I like to go there in my sleep
Arent any floors for me to
sweep
Not in my castle on a cloud

Cosette gets out from a hiding place in the wall a knotted
grimy rag - this is her doll the knot is the dolls head

There is a lady all in white
Holds me and sings a lullaby
Shes nice to see and shes soft to
touch

(holding doll to her ear

and whispering)

She says Cosette I love you
very much

I know a place where no ones
lost

I know a place where no one
cries

Crying at all is not allowed
Not in my castle on a cloud

Madame Thenardier comes bustling down the stairs in a bad
mood She glowers at little Cosette and changes the closed
sign from closed to open

MADAME THENARDIER
Now look whos here
The little madam herself
Pretending once again
Shes been so awfully good
Better not let me catch you
slacking
Better not catch my eye
Ten rotten francs your mother
sends me -
What is that going to buy
Now take that pail
My little Mademoiselle
And go and draw some water from
the well
We should never have taken you in
In the first place -
How stupid the things that we do
Like mother like daughter the
scum of the street

Cosette goes to put the broom away

Eponine comes in from outside

MADAME THENARDIER
Eponine come my dear
Eponine let me see you

You look very well in that little
blue hat

Theres some little girls who
know how to behave

And they know what to wear

And Im saying thank heaven for
that

Madame Thenardier sees that Cosette far from going is
hiding behind the far wall We see Cosettes frightened
eyes peering out from a tiny gap in this wall

MADAME THENARDIER
Still there Cosette
Your tears will do you no good
I told you to fetch some water
from the well in the wood

COSETTE
(singing through the gap)
Please do not send me out alone
Not in the darkness on my own

Madame Thenardier imitates Cosette as she sings

MADAME THENARDIER
(singing through the gap)
Enough of that or Ill forget to
be nice
You heard me ask for something
And I never ask twice

The innkeepers gang posing as customers who have been
loitering outside come in explaining to a fifth man who is a
newer recruit a story from Monsieur Thenardiers past Madame
Thenardier goes outside to open up the rather pathetic frost
fair stall on the porch of the inn

CUSTOMER 1
Mine host Thenardier
He was there so they say
At the field of Waterloo

We suddenly hear the voice of the landlord Thenardier He
has been there all the time asleep on a bench He wakes
from his drunken slumbers and roars out

Madame Thenardier to pick his wallet from a back pocket as
he stands up Monsieur Thenardier takes his coat which
allows the couple to see the customer transfer a pocket
watch from coat to jacket pocket

THENARDIER
As for the rest -

All of them crooks
Rooking the guests
And cooking the books
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me

A gent of good intent
Whos content to be -

He pours a strong drink for the new customer -

Ready with a handshake

Thenardier has thieved the pocket watch using his handshake
as a distraction He passes this off to Madame Thenardier

EXT WOOD BY THE INN - NIGHT

Cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood and
is now heading back Through the dark trees ahead we glimpse
the cheerful lights of the Frost Fair and the distant inn
She goes slowly because the buckets are heavy She hums to
herself to keep her spirits up a wordless verse of “Castle
on a Cloud

After a few steps she pauses to rest the weight of the
buckets

Strong arms reach for the buckets and lift them out of her
hands She looks up amazed Theres Valjean

VALJEAN

She gazes up at him Hardly knowing why

Hush now do not be afraid of me
Dont cry Show me where you live

VALJEAN (contd)
Tell me my child what is your
name

COSETTE

VALJEAN
Cosette

Valjean enters with Cosette Madame Thenardier hurries
over Madame and Monsieur Thenardier try to thieve from
Valjean using the same tricks established earlier but he
evades every attempt Eponine watches silently froma

corner

VALJEAN
I found her wandering in the wood
This little child I found her
trembling in the shadows
And I am here to help Cosette
And I will settle any debt you
may think proper
I will pay what I must pay
To take Cosette away

This is a duty I must heed
There is a promise I have made
For I was blind to one in need
I did not see what stood before
me

Now your mother is with God

Her suffering is over

And I speak here with her voice
And I stand here in her place
and from this day and ever more

MADAME THENARDIER
Let me take your coat msieur

VALJEAN
Cosette shall have a father now

Thenardier turns to his wife

THENARD IER
What to do What to say
Shall you carry our treasure
away
What a gem What a pearl
Beyond rubies is our little girl
How can we speak of debt
Lets not haggle for darling
Colette

MADAME THENARDIER
Cosette

THENARD IER
Cosette -
Dear Fantine - gone to rest -
Have we done for her child what
is best
Shared our bread - shared each
bone -
Treated her like shes one of our
own
Like our own msieur

VALJEAN
Your feelings do you credit sir
And I will ease the parting blow
Let us not talk of bargains and

bones and greed
He gives Thenardier money

VALJEAN
Now may I say we are agreed

MADAME THENARDIER
That would quite fit the bill
If she hadnt so often been ill
Little dear cost us dear
Medicines are expensive msieur
Not that we begrudged a sou -
Its no more than we Christians
must do

Valjean gives more money

THENARDIERS
One thing more One small doubt
There are treacherous people
about
No offence Please reflect
Your intentions may not be
correct

Valjean hands over more money

VALJEAN
No more Heres your price
Fifteen hundred for your
sacrifice
Come Cosette say goodbye
Lets seek out some friendlier
sky
Thank you both for Cosette -

forget

He leads Cosette to the door

The cab sets off down the road

INT INN MONTFERMEIL - NIGHT 45

Madame Thenardier takes the bunch of notes from her
husbands hand and inspects them

THENARD IER
Not bad

MADAME THENARDIER

Through the open door Thenardier sees a man on horseback
rattling up to the inn

MADAME THENARDIER
Theres a copper at the door
What the devil have you done

Javert strides into the inn

JAVERT
Wheres the child Cosette

MADAME THENARDIER
Shes gone with a gent
Didnt tell us where they went
Didnt leave his home address

JAVERT
Did you catch the fellows name

Both Thenardiers shake their heads

Javert stares once contemptuously round the seedy inn
and departs without a further word Thenardier goes to the
doorway to watch him leave

MADAME THENARDIER
Youre a bloody fool
Look at what we got

THENARDIER
Should have struck the iron
Struck it while its hot

THENARDIERMADAME THENARDIER

Next time round well be here
And were gonna get the lot

EXT OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS - NIGHT

Valjeans cab moving fast passes down the road into the

city

IN CAB - Valjean has one arm round Cosette to protect her
from the jolting of the cab He gazes at her as she slips

into a fitful sleep

VALJEAN
Suddenly I see
Suddenly it starts
When two anxious hearts
Beat as one
Yesterday I was alone
Today you walk beside me
Something still unclear
Something not yet here
Has begun
Suddenly the world
Seems a different place
Somehow full of grace

VALJEAN (contd)
And delight

How was I to know

That so much love

Was held inside me
Something fresh and young
Something still unsung
Fills the night

How was I to know at last

That happiness can come so fast
Trusting me the way you do

Im so afraid of failing you
Just a child who cannot know
That danger follows where I go
There are shadows everywhere

And memories I cannot share

Nevermore alone

Nevermore apart

You have warmed my heart

Like the sun

You have brought the gift of life
And love so long denied me

Suddenly I see

What I could not see

Something suddenly

Has begun
He brushes the hair from her face and satisfies himself
that shes comfortable Then he puts his head out of the
window At the gate into Paris soldiers are checking
documents of occupants of carriages
Valjean slips out of the carriage with Cosette and makes
his way along the wall away from the gate

The narrow street turns and opens out onto the river
Valjean stops There on the other side of the river in the
light of a lamp stands Javert

47 SCENE OMITTED 47

48 EXT MAZE OF OLD STREETS - NIGHT 48

Now Valjean and Cosette are running - down narrow alleys
into small dark courtyards not knowing which way to turn
Whenever Valjean thinks theyve thrown their pursuer there

he is not far behind And hes no longer alone With him
are a detachment of soldiers

Javert and his team never seem to run But hes always
there

EXT DEAD END - NIGHT 49

Valjean and Cosette turn into a street that is walled in by
high windowless houses They follow it round a corner to
find - a dead end A high wall before them Theyre
trapped

Valjean looks round No way out Then he sees a nearby lamp
bracket Hanging from it is the rope that is used to lower
the oil lamp for lighting He tears off the rope and ties
one end round Cosette beneath her armpits Then holding
the other end he scales the wall using the corner to
brace himself as he rises Once on the top he hauls
Cosette up by the rope Only then does he turn to look down
onto the other side

A cloister A building in the middle windows glowing
Grave stones black against the white snow The sound of
womens voices singing a psalm

NUNS
Te lucis ante terminum
Rerum Creator poscimus
Ut pro tua clementia
Sis praesul et custodia

Valjean lowers Cosette down into the garden and drops down
after her

Javert and his men enter the dead end to find them gone

INT CONVENT CLOISTER - NIGHT 50

Valjean crouched low with Cosette in his arms holding her
still and quiet until Javert is gone

Then he straightens up and looks round He takes in the
sound of singing

NUNS
Procul recedant somnia
Et noctium phantasmata

NUNS (contd)
Hostemque nostrum comprime
Ne polluantur corpora

He goes closer to the windows of the building Through the
blurry glass he can make out a chapel and a line of nuns
singing

Valjean continues and sees a man filling in a new grave
The man starts as he sees Valjean

FAUCHELEVENT
Whos that

Valjean jumps takes Cosette protectively into his arms
Turns to answer

FAUCHELEVENT
Why its Monsieur Mayor

Its Fauchelevent now a gardener still limping from his
injury

VALJEAN
Who are you

FAUCHELEVENT
Dont you remember The cart fell
on me

VALJEAN

Monsieur Fauchelevent

FAUCHELEVENT
You saved my life You got me
this job as a gardener

Valjean gazes at him and remembers

VALJEAN
Now you can do the same for me
We need a place of sanctuary
This child and I we need to
disappear

FAUCHELEVENT
In this place of Holy Orders
You are brought to Gods domain
May the sisters grant you shelter
May their prayers ease your pain
Valjean and Cosette follow him to the convent

VALJEAN
Well give thanks for what is
granted
What the sisters may ordain
Here we pray for new beginnings -
Here our lives can start again

Valjean looks to the heavens The camera soars into the air
and heads east as dawn breaks over Paris We rush low over

Paris as the sun comes up towards the Place de la Bastille

EXT PLACE DE LA BASTILLE PARIS - DAY
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION
Nine years later

The dawn light glows on a massive ELEPHANT The monument
made of wood and plaster now ruined and crumbling stands
on a plinth on one side of the wide open square On the far
side the remains of the great fortress that was the
Bastille In the middle scaffolding surrounds a half-built
triumphal column which is being erected to celebrate the
new regime

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION
Paris 1832

The streets that run from the square lead in one direction
to the Paris of power and wealth in the other direction
into the slums

The camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant

A head pops out of one of the elephants many holes -
GAVROCHE a street urchin He gives a shrill whistle At
once a dozen more street urchins show themselves from
every crack in the monuments skin Agile as a monkey
Gavroche drops to the ground followed by his band

EXT PARIS BOULEVARD - DAY
FOLLOW GAVROCHE in as he races down a grand boulevard

dodging the crowds of strolling bourgeoisie and beggars
weaving in and out of the lines of carriages attempting to

make their way in either direction These are the
conveyances of the rich fine gilded coaches with matched
horses and footmen on the back Virtually at a standstill
they lend Gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to
coach a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite

As he goes the poor on the pavements sing to the stony-
faced rich in their golden high-sprung glory -

BEGGARS CHORUS
Look down and see the beggars at
your feet
Look down and show some mercy if
you can
Look down and see the sweepings
of the street

BEGGARS CHORUS (contd)
Look down look down
Upon your fellow man

The fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert
their eyes or raise the blinds of their carriage windows
to shut out the sight of the losers of their world

Gavroche bounding over their heads evading the swipes of
liveried footmen lands on the running board of one
particularly grand carriage and begstaunts the RICH
OCCUPANT

GAVROCHE
“Ow do you do My names
Gavroche
These are my people heres my
patch
Not much to look at - nothing
posh
Nothing that youd call up to
scratch
This is my school my high
society

Here in the slums of St Michel
We live on crumbs of humble piety
Tough on the teeth - but what the
hell

Think youre poor Think youre
free

Follow me Follow me

BEGGARS CHORUS
Look down and show some mercy if
you can

Look down look down upon your
fellow man

STILL RUNNING WITH Gavroche as he hops onto the back of
another very grand carriage the traffic now moving at

last

hitching a ride on the back - one or two of his gang

hop on back of carriage with him the others run panting
after to hear his political lecture

GAVROCHE
There was a time we killed the
ing
We tried to change the world too
fast

Now we have got another King

He is no better than the last
This is the land that fought for
liberty -

Now when we fight we fight for
bread

Here is the thing about equality -
Everyones equal when theyre

dead
Take your place

GAVROCHE (contd)
Take your chance
Vive la France Vive la France

The carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a
crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of
sickness The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch
what is going on The street is padded with straw Many eyes
gaze up at the draped windows People cross themselves A
priest is seen hurrying into the house accompanied by two
altar boys

Gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd
The crowd is made up of citizens of Paris student

impassioned speech with fellow student MARIUS The occupant
of the stopped carriage is MONSIEUR GILLENORMAND Marius
Grandfather He is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson
engaged in such an activity

In the crowd a young street girl EPONINE has her eyes fixed
longingly on the handsome Marius

ENJOLRAS
Where are the leaders of the

Marius looks towards Lamarques house behind him

ENJOLRAS

Marius turns to see his Grandfather staring him down
furious

behaving

like a child

Gillenormand spies a gun poking out of his jacket

Gillenormand turns to get back in his carriage

INT GORBEAU TENEMENT

Through a crack in

hunting rifle from

a door we see Marius sitting on a tatty
mattress in a tiny hovel of a room He is taking out a

under the mattress wrapped in a rag His
eye is caught by the ring on his finger

CLOSE ON a signet ring a family crest

Marius stares at the ring then takes it off his finger

We reveal EPONINE staring at him through the door

EPONINE

Hey there Monsieur whats new
with you

Havent seen much of you of late

Planning

Plotting

no doubt to change the

to overthrow the state

Still living here in this old sewer
Might as well doss down in a ditch
You still pretending to be poor
Everyone knows your Grandpas rich

Marius rushes down

the stairs of the slum

Eponine following

We see glimpses of misery off the stairwell

MARIUS

How did you

I like the way you talk Monsieur

I like t

EPONINE

MARIUS

Eponine comes to a stop looking wistfully after Marius

EPONINE
Little he knows -
Little he sees

EXT RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - END OF DAY 55

Marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau
Tenement by a passing carriage Once it passes Marius sees
two people in the street outside One is an old gentleman
Valjean The other is a beautiful young girl Cosette The
two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from
evening church service

Marius cant take his eyes off Cosette Hes never seen
anyone so lovely in his life We hear the instrumental
foreshadowing of “A Heart Full of Love

As if drawn by Mariuss gaze Cosette looks up and meets
his eyes She too is amazed hes looking at her as if he
already knows her A second carriage breaks their held
gaze

Marius continues on down the street and when he looks back
at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again

Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her guarding her
jealously from this distant boys gaze

We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the
Thenardiers heavily disguised are waiting for Valjeans
approach with their gang of crooks Babet Brujon
Clacquesous Montparnasse

THENARD IER
Everyone here you know your
place -
Brujon Babet Clacquesous -
You Montparnasse watch for the
law -
With Eponine - take care
(Montparnasse hurries over
to the doorway where
Eponine was watching
Marius)
You turn on the tears
(to Madame Thenardier who
is holding a baby)
No mistakes my dears

Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth
of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sat on the
ground holding the crying infant Cosette is a few steps
behind still entranced by the sight of Marius

THENARD IER
Please Msieur come this way
Heres a child that aint eaten
today
Save a life spare a sou
God rewards all the good that you
do

As Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier she
recognizes him

MADAME THENARDIER
Wait a bit Know that face
(to Monsieur Thenardier)
Aint the world a remarkable
place

THENARD IER
Men like me dont forget -
Youre the bastard who borrowed
Cosette

VALJEAN
What is this Are you mad
No Monsieur you dont know what
you say

Thenardier pulls off his disguise Valjean recognises him

THENARD IER
You know me I know you
And youll pay what Im due

He signals to his gang A door opens in the alleyway
revealing the huge Brujon The gang move in on Valjean
menacingly

EPONINE
(shouts from up the
street)
Its the police Disappear
Run for it Its Javert
The gang spill out into the street to find themselves
confronted by Javert now with his men Marius watches as
does Gavroche drawn by the rumpus

JAVERT
Another brawl in the square
Another stink in the air
Was there a witness to this
Well let him speak to Javert

He sees man with his arm protectively round a girl but does
not recognize Valjean as Valjean has averted his face

JAVERT
Monsieur these streets are not
safe
But let these vermin beware
Well see that justice is done

He turns back on the Thenardier gang in the passage

JAVERT
Look upon this fine collection
Crawled from underneath a stone
This swarm of worms and maggots
Could have picked you to the
bone
I know this man over here
I know his name and his trade
And on your witness msieur
Ill see him suitably paid

He turns back to find Valjean and Cosette gone

JAVERT
But wheres the gentlemen gone
And why on earth did he run

THENARD IER
You will have a job to find him
Hes not all he seems to be -
And that girl he trails behind
him
Shes the child he stole from me

Marius equally baffled goes off in search of them

JAVERT
Could it be hes that old
jailbird

That the tide now washes in
Heard my name and started
running

All the omens point to him

Thenardier listening hears this all with great interest
So Valjean is a crook like him

JAVERT
And the girl who stood beside
him
When I turned they both had gone
Could he be the man Ive hunted
Could it be hes Jean Valjean

THENARD IER
In the absence of a victim
Dear Inspector may I go
And remember when youve nicked
him
It was me what told you so

JAVERT
(to himself)
Let the old man keep on running
I will run him off his feet
(to the crowd)
Everyone about your business

(to Gavroche)
Clear this garbage off the
street

Gavroche is sitting on a horse trough and falls back into it
when Javert surprises him

He is furious He sings to Javerts departing back and to
Marius who is close by

GAVROCHE
That inspector thinks hes
something
But its me who runs this town
And my theatre never closes
And the curtains never down
Trust Gavroche Have no fear
You can always find me here

EPONINE
Cosette Now I remember
Cosette How can it be

We were children together
Look whats become of me

She turns back to find Marius gazing down the street

MARIUS
Eponine Who was that girl

EPONINE
That bourgeois two-a-penny thing

MARIUS
Eponine find her for me

EPONINE
What will you give me

MARIUS
Anything

EPONINE
Got you all excited now
But God knows what you see in
her
Arent you all delighted now
No I dont want your money sir

MARIUS
Eponine do this for me
Discover where she lives
But careful how you go -
Dont let your father know
Eponine Im lost until shes
found
EPONINE
You see I told you so
Theres lots of things I know

looking out of a door leading onto the roof As he sings
he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the
HQ a monumental stone eagle He looks down at the lights
reflected in the river below Then up at the great city
Javert too has a God and this is his prayer

JAVERT
There out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Running from God
Fallen from grace -
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face -
Till we come face to face

He knows his way in the dark
Mine is the way of the Lord
Those who follow the path of the
righteous

Shall have their reward

And if they fall

The flame

The sword

Stars in your multitudes
Scarce to be counted

Filling the darkness

With order and light -

You are the sentinels

Silent and sure

Keeping watch in the night -

You know your place in the sky
You hold your course

JAVERT (contd)
And your aim
And each in your season
Returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall
As Lucifer fell
You fall
In flame

And so it must be and so it is

written

On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter

And those who fall

Must pay the price

Lord let me find him

That I may see him

Safe behind bars

will never rest till then
This I swear

This I swear by the stars

They burst into laughter But Enjolras isnt smiling

ENJOLRAS
It is time for us all

Do we fight for the right

Have you asked yourselves
Whats the price you might pay

For rich young boys to play

Are changing day by day -

Red - the blood of angry men
Black - the dark of ages past
Red - a world about to dawn
Black - the night that ends at
last

MARIUS

Had you seen her today

You might know how it feels

To be struck to the bone

By a moment of breathless delight

Had you been there today

You might also have known

How the world may be changed
In just one burst of light

And what was right seems wrong
And what was wrong seems right

GRANTAIRE

I feel my soul on fire

GAVROCHE
General Lamarque is dead
Enjolras turns to his companions

ENJOLRAS
Lamarque is dead
Lamarque His death is the hour

of fate

The peoples man

His death is the sign we await
On his funeral day they will
honour his name

With the light of rebellion
ablaze in their eyes

From their candles of grief we
will kindle our flame

On the tomb of Lamarque shall our
barricades rise

The time is here

ENJOLRAS (contd)
Let us welcome it gladly with
courage and cheer

STUDENT
Let us take to the street with no
doubt in our hearts

COURFEYRAC
But a jubilant shout

LESGLES

As the students sing Eponine enters wanting to talk to

Marius Marius sees her

65 INT VALJEANS HOUSE RUE PLUMET - NIGHT

Cosette is pacing in her bedroom Its a pretty room the
best room in this small summer house Her shutters are

open giving a view of a wild unkempt garden

She looks at

herself in a mirror aware of her looks perhaps for the

first time

COSETTE
How strange -

This feeling that my lifes begun
at last

This change -

Can people really fall in love so
fast

Whats the matter with you
Cosette

Have you been too much on your
own

So many things unclear -

So many things unknown

In my life

There are so many questions and
answers

That somehow seem wrong

In my life

There are times when I catch in
the silence

The sigh of a faraway song

And it sings

Of a world that I long to see -
Out of reach

Just a whisper away

Waiting for me

Does he know Im alive
Do I know if hes real

COSETTE (contd)
Does he see what I see
Does he feel what I feel

In my life

Im no longer alone -

Now the love in my life

Is so near

Find me now Find me here

Valjean knocks and opens her door He closes her shutters

VALJEAN
Dear Cosette
Youre such a lonely child
How pensive how sad you seem to
me
Believe me were it within my
power
Id fill each passing hour
How quiet it must be I can see
With only me for company

COSETTE
heres so little I know
hat Im longing to know
f the man that you were
na time long ago
heres so little you say
f the life you have known
hy you keep to yourself
hy were always alone
o dark So dark and deep
he secrets that you keep
In my life
Please forgive what I say
You are loving and gentle and
good
But papa dear papa
In your eyes I am still like that
child
Who was lost in a wood

HHS sSoHHOHSH

VALJEAN
No more words -
No more words
Its a time that is dead
There are words
That are better unheard
Better unsaid

COSETTE
In my life
Im no longer a child and I yearn
For the truth that you know

Of the years Years ago

Valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom A simple wooden
shack at the back of the summerhouse Valjean himself lives
with spartan simplicity - he has given the best room to
Cosette

Cosette follows Valjean sits on his bed his back to
Cosette

VALJEAN
You will learn
Truth is given by God
To us all in our time
In our turn
66 EXT RUE PLUMET - NIGHT

Marius rushes down the street Eponine following At the
far end is the walled garden behind which lies Valjeans
house

MARIUS
In my life

angels
The light of the sun
And my life seems to stop
As if something is over

Gods
And heaven is near
And I soar through a world that
is new

Valjean comes to the door

VALJEAN
Cosette Cosette
Cosette turns and runs in to the house
Valjean walks down the overgrown garden path to the gate

Marius moves quickly away instinctively nervous of
discovery and hides behind the wall

Valjean peers into the shadows He senses that perhaps
Cosette has been talking to someone He looks pensive

Valjean returns inside

Cosette has dropped a keepsake through the gate Marius picks
it up

Marius makes his way back down the street filled with
thoughts of his love Completely forgetting Eponine is there

Shadows move up the street from the other direction Its
Thenardier and his gang They gather at the wrought-iron
gate

MONTPARNASSE
This is his lair
Ive seen the old fox around

BABET
He keeps himself to himself
Hes staying close to the ground

Its time we settled the debt
This1ll cost him dear

BRUJON

Brujon starts working on the gate lock He finds Eponine
lurking in the shadows

Take care young miss
Youve got a lot to say

BRUJON
Shes going soft

CLACQUESOUS

They huddle round the garden gate which is now broken

regret it for a year

He goes to the gate and opens it

Eponine screams

to the window

EXT RUE PLUMET - NIGHT

Thenardier and his gang shrink into the shadows as
Eponines scream ends at last

THENARDIER

He turns on Eponine and slaps her hard across the face

THENARDIER
You wait my girl

Youll scream all right

His men have levered up a grating and now Thenardier and
the gang disappear down into the sewers

INT VALJEANS HOUSE - RUE PLUMET PARIS - NIGHT

Valjean comes running into Cosettes room Valjean takes
her in his arms

VALJEAN
My God Cosette
I heard a cry in the dark
I heard the shout of angry voices
in the street

COSETTE

Three men I saw beyond the
wall
Three men in shadow moving fast

VALJEAN
This is a warning to us all
These are the shadows of the
past

He moves away to his own bedroom

VALJEAN
Must be Javert

Cosette hurries down the garden to the gate and goes to
put the folded letter in the grill where her and Marius
hands entwined Then she sees Eponine Eponine steps

forward She thrusts her letter into her hand

COSETTE
Please give this to Marius He
must know where to find me

She runs back inside

EXT RUE PLUMETBRIDGERUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - NIGHT

Eponine crumples up the letter
She walks sadly away down the street
Rain is just starting to fall

EPONINE
And now Im all alone again -
Nowhere to turn no one to go to
Without a home without a friend

EPONINE (contd)
Without a face to say hello to
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head

On my own

Pretending hes beside me

All alone

I walk with him till morning
Without him

I feel his arms around me

And when I lose my way I close my
eyes

And he has found me

She crosses a bridge over the river

EPONINE
In the rain
The pavement shines like silver
All the lights
Are misty in the river
In the darkness the trees are
full of starlight
And all I see is him and me
forever and forever

And I know its only in my mind -
That Im talking to myself and
not to him

And although I know that he is
blind

Still I say theres a way for us

I love him

But when the night is over

He is gone - the rivers just a
river

Without him the world around me
changes -

The trees are bare and everywhere
The streets are full of
strangers

I love him

But every day Im learning

All my life Ive only been
pretending

Without me his world will go on
turning

A world thats full of happiness
That I have never know

I love him
I love him
I love him
But only on my own

Her solitary journey has brought her to the Gorbeau slum
She goes inside

Marius sets off at a run towards the Rue Plumet

staring in shock

Eponine has followed him and watches him in silence

We pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at
the first floor window with the students beyond them to see
that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the
street and have all joined in the final chorus

85 EXT PARIS STREETS - DAY

All is still Then comes the soft beating of draped drums
The tramp of feet

All down the streets waiting the silent faces of the
poor Among them we see Enjolras Marius and the radical

students

Police and national guardsmen control the growing crowds

Now into view come the leaders of a great FUNERAL
PROCESSION An entire battalion of infantry marching with
weapons reversed A column of black-suited dignitaries
carrying branches of laurel A division of Cavalry rides in
front behind a section of military drummers who drum a
military tatoo

INTO FRAME comes a team of black horses stepping slowly
black plumes nodding drawing behind them a gun carriage
draped in the tricolour flag On the carriage stands a
COFFIN

Softly in time with the drums the watching people begin
to sing

CROWD
Do you hear the people sing
Singing the song of angry men
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again

The police and guardsmen look round to see who is singing
so subversively but they cant be sure where its coming
from The singing grows stronger

CROWD
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes

The dignitaries become aware of the singing and glance
uneasily from side to side

CROWD
Will you join in our crusade
Who will be strong and stand with
me
Beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see

As the coffin on its carriage draws level with the students
Enjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses drawing
the carriage and waves the red flag stopping the horses and
the procession

ENJOLRAS
Then join in the fight
That will give you the right
To be free

The students break the ranks of the crowd and surround the
coffin carriage

STUDENTS CROWD
Do you hear the people sing
Singing the song of angry men
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes

Enjolras Marius and Courfeyrac and other students climb
onto the top of the carriage as the horses and led by
Combeferre

As the pro

Somewhere beyond the barricade

It is the future that we bring
When tomorrow comes

The students and crowd come face to face with the calvary On
one side muskets of the infantry poke through the broken
down fence surrounding the elephant Other infantry have
taken up position in a cafe opposite upending tables to
provide cover

There is a tense prolonged silence Then suddenly one
nervous SOLDIER lets off a round It hits a middle aged
kindly looking WOMAN CITIZEN in the crowd around the coffin
carriage The crowd is furious Students charge the soldier
grab his musket and knock him down with the hilt of the gun

More shots ring out The cavalry charges The funeral
explodes into a riot The people of Paris turn on the
dragoons the National Guards the police More squadrons
of dragoons charge into the crowd sabres unsheathed Women
run screaming in terror

Some students fire weapons into the air some into the

officer off his horse and Marius jumps on the horse

The students break away and race off through the cafe into
a side street where citizens begin to erect a barricade A
cavalry rider gives chase and is shot by one of the
students and falls through the window of an upended
carriage The students with Marius on horseback race to
the slums

EXT RUE DE LA CHANVRERIEINT CAFE MUSAIN - DAY

FOLLOW the students as they burst into their home street
They have been joined by a motley collection of citizens
including burghers and an old eccentric man FATHER MABEUF
who works as hard as anyone They raid a fencing shop and a
gun shop for weapons they force wives to give up their
husbands muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution
on their front doors they encourage homeowners to
contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to
help overcome any reluctance Soon the street is raining
tables chairs mattresses sofas They smash streetlamps
They set to work to build their barricade Students
commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the
barricades heart Three students arrive in the street

hauling an uprooted tree

They pull up paving stones rip boards timbers and front
doors from house and shop-fronts pull down buttresses and
raid the Cafe Musain systematically stripping it of every
item of furniture despite the lamentations and
protestations of Madame Hucheloup and her barmaid

As the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor
of the cafe the rifles and ammunition theyve gathered to
prepare to defend their chosen ground A student stands on
a stone post distributing weapons They line the first and
second floor front rooms with paving stones to create
protected shooting positions The inside of the barricade
is built neatly with steps up made from paving stones The
outside is a crazy knarled mess

ENJOLRAS
Here upon these stones
We will build our barricade
In the heart of the city
We claim as our own
Each man to his duty
And dont be afraid

A man in workers clothing is helping build the growing
barricade He wears the insignia of the rebels and keeps
his head down

ENJOLRAS
Wait
I will need a report
On the strength of the foe

The man whos just arrived looks up Its Javert

JAVERT
I can find out the truth
I know their ways
Fought their wars
Served my time
In the days
Of my youth

He slips away through the barricade which is still rising

EXT BARRICADE - DUSK 87

The barricade is now complete an impressive wall up to
twelve feet high with one heavily guarded section that can
be wheeled open to allow access Two smaller barricades
protect the left and right side of the cafe Enjolras
climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his
little army Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame
Hucheloups furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing
armchair - and adds it to the barricade As the men sing
she steals it back defiantly

ENJOLRAS
Red the blood of angry men

ALL
Black the dark of ages past
Red a world about to dawn
Black the night that ends at
last

EXT BARRICADE - NIGHT 87A

It is night The students have been waiting for hours

A single flaming torch atop the barricade caged in by cobbles
underlights a fluttering red flag

There is no sign yet of any opposition

A boy climbs down from sentry duty on the barricade Marius
realizes its Eponine She sits down with her back to him

MARIUS
Hey little boy whats this I see
God Eponine the things you do

EPONINE
I know this is no place for me
Still I would rather be with you

MARIUS
Get out before the trouble
starts
Get out “Ponine you might get
shot

EPONINE

Ive got you worried now I have
That shows you like me quite a
lot

MARIUS
Get Out

Joly sentry on the main barricade sees a figure approach

JOLY
Hes back

Javert still in his disguise as a rebel is let back
through the guarded ‘gate into the barricaded street

JAVERT
Listen my friends
have done as I said
have been to their lines
have counted each man
will tell what I can
Better be warned
They have armies to spare
And our danger is real -
We will need all our cunning
To bring them to heel

ENJOLRAS

Have faith

f you know what their movements
are

Well spoil their game

There are ways that a people can
fight -

We shall overcome their power

JAVERT
I have overheard their plans
There will be no attack tonight
They intend to starve you out
Before they start a proper fight -
Concentrate their force
Hit us when its light -

GAVROCHE
Liar

They all look up Theres Gavroche on the top of the
barricade

GAVROCHE
Good evening dear Inspector
Lovely evening my dear
I know this man my friends
His names Inspector Javert
So dont believe a word he says
Cause none of its true
This only goes to show
What little people can do

Guns swing round to aim at Javert He stares back in
defiance

Gavroche comes dancing down the barricade to Courfeyracs

delighted embrace

COURFEYRAC
Bravo little Gavroche
Youre the top of the class

Gavroche grabs Grantaires red cap and puts it on his own
head mimicking the students

PROUVAIRE
So what are we going to do
With this snake in the grass

Enjolras faces Javert

ENJOLRAS
Tie this man and take him
To the tavern in there
The people will decide your fate
Inspector Javert
JAVERT
Shoot me now or shoot me later -
Every schoolboy to his sport
Death to each and every traitor
I renounce your peoples court

ENJOLRAS
Take this man Bring him through
There is work we have to do

Javert is led into the cafe As they pass through the front
door only one student is holding Javert Seizing his
opportunity Javert breaks free and the students have to
subdue him by force Javert is on his knees and is being tied
to the staircase

ENJOLRAS
When are they coming

Silence

Suddenly out of the darkness the students and citizens at
the barricade here an ominous distant sound The sound of
marching feet hundreds of men marching in unison First
soft then building louder and louder closer and closer
Boots on cobbles The sound comes right into the end of the
street

Enjolras and all the students man the main barricade
Silence

They peer over the barricade In the pitch blackness all
they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers These
are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection

from the torch

A voice shouts out from the darkness

ARMY OFFICER
Whos there

At the same time we hear the clatter of guns being levelled

ENJOLRAS
French Revolution

ARMY OFFICER
Fire
A flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as
though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut

A dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade The red flag
falls the pole sliced through Bullets richochet off the
cornices of the houses bore into the barricade and wound
several men

ENJOLRAS
(as students return fire)
Comrades do not fire back Do not
waste powder

In the darkness the clang of ramrods in muskets - the troop
reloading weapons

Enjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up
when the old man Father Mabeuf who has seen many
insurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the
top of the barricade

ARMY OFFICER

Vive la France

ARMY OFFICER
Fire

A second volley

Father Mabeuf falls down dead While everyone is reacting to
the dead old man and the wounded the men are distracted from
noticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of
darkness to creep down the street

All at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins Shouts and the
rattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over
the barricade The students run for their guns and return
fire They are taken by surprise All could be lost in the
first instant Some soldiers make it up to the top of the
barricade where theyre driven back by the fierce
resistance of the defenders Eponine sees one soldier
aiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of
Marius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe

They are being overrun Panic ensues The gun battle is
fierce Marius in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost
unless they do something He drags a barrel of gunpowder to
the top of the barricade grabs the torch and with a face of

deadly resolve he tips the torch towards the barrel

MARIUS
Clear out or Ill blow up the
barricade

Everyone freezes

ARMY OFFICER
Blow it up then and take yourself
with it

MARIUS
And myself with it

Marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg
But already the soldiers have cleared out
Marius comes down from the barricade

FEUILLY
(to Marius)
Thank you

LESGLES
What were you thinking

As everyone surrounds Marius in amazement he spots Eponine
lying propped against the barricade

MARIUS
Eponine What have you done

He kneels by her side Eponine is dying

EPONINE
Here Its from Cosette
I kept it from you

With a struggle she pulls the letter out of her pocket and
pushes it into his hand

EPONINE
Dont be too hard on me

Marius is shocked to find blood pouring from her wound
MARIUS

Eponine youre hurt
You need some help
Rain begins to fall

EPONINE
Dont you fret Msieur Marius -
I dont feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now
Youre here - thats all I need
to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers
grow

MARIUS

But you will live Eponine - Dear
God above

If I could close your wounds with
words of love -

EPONINE
Just hold me now and let it be
Shelter me Comfort me

MARIUS
You will live a hundred years
£ I could show you how
wont desert you now

EPONINE
The rain cant hurt me now
This rain will wash away whats
past
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
ll sleep in your embrace at
last

Marius tries to comfort Eponine in his arms

MARIUS
Hush-a-bye dear Eponine
You wont feel any pain
A little fall of rain

EPONINE

I dont feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now

MARIUS
I will stay with you
Till you are sleeping

EPONINE
Thats all I need to know
And you will keep me safe

EPONINE (contd)
And you will keep me close
And rain

Grow

Eponine dies in Mariuss arms
Marius looks up at the others his eyes full of tears

ENJOLRAS
They were the first to fall
The first to fall upon this
barricade

MARIUS
Her name was Eponine
Her life was cold and dark yet
she was unafraid

COMBEFERRE
We fight here in her name

PROUVAIRE
She will not die in vain

LESGLES
She will not be betrayed

They pick up Eponines body and carry her into the tavern

COURFEYRAC
(to Gavroche)
Are you alright

GAVROCHE
That was my sister

EXT BARRICADE - NIGHT 88

Marius reads the letter Eponine has given him He takes out
pencil and paper and writes a note Looking round he sees
Gavroche

MARIUS
Gavroche Do you know the Rue de
1Homme Armé

GAVROCHE
Course I do

MARIUS
Will you take this for me

He holds out his note

INT INN RUE DE LHOMME ARMEE PARIS - NIGHT 89

The LANDLADY climbs the stairs followed by Gavroche The
landlady indicates the door and Gavroche knocks boldly
The door opens a crack to reveal a cautious Valjean

GAVROCHE
Letter for Cosette

VALJEAN
Ill take it

Gavroche holds out the letter with one hand not quite
giving it the other hand open for a tip

Valjean gives him a coin which he pockets as he hands over
the letter

GAVROCHE
Something for you something for
me Who needs charity

INT VALJEANS ROOM LODGING HOUSE - NIGHT 90
ON VALJEAN - As he reads the note
VALJEAN
“Dearest Cosette you have

entered my soul
And soon you will be gone

Can it be only a day since we met
And the world was reborn

f I should fall in the battle to
come

Let this be my goodbye

Now that I know you love me as
well

t is harder to die

pray that God will bring me
home

To be with you

Pray for your Marius

He prays for you

He looks up deeply distressed He cant bear the thought
of losing Cosette

VALJEAN
They havent got a chance these
boys
They almost certainly will die
Shell be alone
And she will need me all the more
And we will go on as before
When he is gone
I dare not think like this
I must find this boy

EXT PARIS STREETS - NIGHT 91
Valjean walks the streets not caring where he goes
struggling with his tormented thoughts He sees a barricade

being dismantled And bodies

Suddenly he knows what hes going to do He sees a dead
soldier He takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on

He continues on his way in the dark

Looking up he sees that hes been walking all the time
towards the very barricade where Marius waits

Now looking like a soldier he passes unchallenged through
their lines and into the shadows

As he passes he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the
rooftops

EXT BARRICADE - NIGHT 92
Glimpses through the barricade of a lone figure approaching
from the far end of the narrow street

The figure comes into lamp light Its Valjean in the
soldiers jacket The student sentries level their guns
Gavroche jumps up

VALJEAN
Dont shoot

JOLY
Here comes a man in uniform
What brings you to this place

VALJEAN
I come here as a volunteer

JOLY
Approach and show your face

PROUVAIRE
You wear an army uniform

VALJEAN
Thats why they let me through

The student sentries open the slot in the barricade to let
Valjean enter

JOLY
Youve got some years behind you
sir

VALJEAN

Theres much that I can do

JOLY
You see that prisoner over there

He points to Javert in a dark corner his hands tied

GRANTAIRE
A volunteer like you

COMBEFERRE
A spy who calls himself Javert

GRANTAIRE
Hes going to get it too
Javert looks up and meets Valjeans eyes A steady shared
look

GAVROCHE
Dont shoot I know him Hes no
soldier

Suddenly Valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the
roofs to gain an angle of attack on them They are aiming at
Enjolras Swiftly Valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them
sending them scattering Quickly other students join in and
the snipers are driven back

There is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a
brief fire fight ensues

The snipers have disappeared
Enjolras turns to Valjean

ENJOLRAS
For your presence of mind
For the deed you have done
will thank you Msieur
When our battle is won

MARIUS
Thank you Msieur

fq

VALJEAN
Give me no thanks Msieur
Theres something you can do

ENJOLRAS
f it is in my power

VALJEAN
Give me the spy Javert
Let me take care of him

Javert hears this with grim satisfaction

JAVERT
The law is inside out
The world is upside down

ENJOLRAS
Do what you have to do -
The man belongs to you
He turns to his little army

ENJOLRAS
The enemy may be regrouping
Hold yourselves in readiness
Come my friends back to your
positions
The dawn is breaking fast

Valjean takes Javert out the back of the Cafe Musain He
carries a knife

VALJEAN
We meet again

JAVERT
Youve hungered for this all your
life
Take your revenge
How right you should kill with a
knife

Valjean uses the knife to cut Javert free
VALJEAN

You talk too much
Your life is safe in my hands

JAVERT
Dont understand

VALJEAN
Get out of here

JAVERT
Valjean take care
Im warning you

VALJEAN
Clear out of here

JAVERT
Once a thief forever a thief
What you want you always steal
You would trade your life for
mine
Yes Valjean you want a deal
Shoot me now for all I care -
If you let me go beware
Youll still answer to Javert

VALJEAN
You are wrong and always have
been wrong
Im a man no worse than any man
You are free and there are no
conditions -
No bargains or petitions
Theres nothing that I blame you

for

Youve done your duty nothing
more

No doubt our paths will cross
again

He raises his gun and points it at Javert

VALJEAN
Go

As Javert goes he raises the gun barrel and fires a single
shot into the air

ENJOLRAS
Courfeyrac you take the watch -
They may attack before its
light
Everybody keep the faith
For certain as our banner flies
We are not alone -
The people too must rise

Marius is manically working to raise the height of one of the
smaller barricades

ENJOLRAS
Marius rest

Grantaire drunkenly starts singing a drinking song and it is
taken up more seriously by Feuilly Bottles are passed round

GRANTAIRE
Drink with me to days gone by

FEUILLY
Sing with me the songs we knew

PROUVAIRE
Heres to pretty girls
Who went to our heads
JOLY
Heres to witty girls
Who went to our beds

STUDENTS
Heres to them -
(Marius sings to
Valjean)
And heres to you

GRANTAIRE
Drink with me to days gone by
Can it be you fear to die
Will the world remember you when
you fall
Can it be your death
Means nothing at all
Is your life just one more lie

Grantaire glares at Enjolras and enters the cafe

ALL
Drink with me
To days gone by
To the life
That used to be
At the shrine of friendship
Never say die
Let the wine of friendship
Never run dry
Heres to you
And heres to me

Valjean is moving through the cafe when he hears Marius
through a window He moves to the window Marius sits beneath
it

MARIUS
Do I care if I should die
Now she goes across the sea
Life without Cosette
Means nothing at all
Please dont weep Cosette
Should Marius fall
Will you weep Cosette
For me

Valjean listens to Mariuss song and hes moved

EXT BARRICADE INT CAFE MUSAIN - NIGHT 93

Look-outs keep watch at either end of the barricaded
street Many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping

Valjean paces unable to sleep inside the cafe Dead
bodies are lined up on the ground floor He comes to a
stop and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window

VALJEAN
God on high
Hear my prayer

VALJEAN (contd)
In my need
You have always been there
He is young
Hes afraid
Let him rest
Heaven blessed
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home
Hes like the son I might have
nown
£ God had granted me a son
The summers die
One by one
How soon they fly
On and on
And I am old
And will be gone
Bring him peace
Bring him joy
He is young
He is only a boy
You can take
You can give
Let him be
Let him live
If I die let me die
Let him live
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home

Valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping Marius

CRANE UP AND UP - Seeing the little world of the barricaded
street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets

round them packed with soldiers in their thousands so many
that we know the little band can never win

CRANE UP AND UP until the barricade and the army that
entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the
centre of the bright lights of Paris

EXT PARIS - DAWN 94

The sun still below the rooftops Every house is tightly
shuttered

INT CAFE MUSAIN - DAWN 95

Grantaire is fast asleep in the upstairs room dead drunk

EXT BARRICADE - DAWN 96

Enjolras re-enters the barricade through the secret gate
He has been on a reconnaissance He looks at the street No
one is stirring but for a single shutter which opens a
crack - a face peeps - and it closes again Below him the
students are up and getting ready

ENJOLRAS
The people have not stirred

COURFEYRAC
Yet we will not abandon those
Who still live in fear

ENJOLRAS
The people have not heard
Yet we will not abandon those who
cannot hear
Let us not waste lives
Let all who wish to
Go from here

There is silence Uncertainty Yet no one moves to go

GAVROCHE
(from top of barricade)
Do you hear the people sing

GAVROCHE COURFEYRAC
Singing the song of angry men
STUDENTS CITIZENS
(joining)

It is the music of the people
Who will not be slaves again
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes

Under this

FEUILLY
Enjolras Ammunitions short

MARIUS
I will go into the streets
There are bodies all around
Ammunition to be had
Lots of bullets to be found

ENJOLRAS
I cant let you go

VALJEAN
Let me go
Hes no more than a boy
I am old
I have nothing to fear

Gavroche is already climbing the barricade under cover of
the smoke

GAVROCHE
I volunteer

COURFEYRAC
Come back Gavroche Dont you
dare

JOLY

Someone pull him down right now

GAVROCHE
Look at me Im almost there

GAVROCHE
Little people know
When little people fight
We may look easy pickings
But weve got some bite

So never kick a dog

When hes just a pup -

Well fight like twenty armies
And we wont give up

The rays of the rising sun break through lighting up
Gavroche

GAVROCHE
So youd better run for cover
When the pup grows -

Crack A musket shot Gavroche falls face down onto the
barricade

COURFEYRAC
No-o

He runs up the barricade seizes Gavroches body in his
arms convulsed with grief and brings it back through the
gate in the barricade

At the other end of the street Javert has appeared He sees
this gate And talks to the Army Officer

As the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed
drawing field artillery into position The Army Officer is
lining up the big guns carefully

ARMY OFFICER
You at the barricades listen to
this
The people of Paris sleep in
their beds
You have no chance
No chance at all
Why throw your lives away

Enjolras gazes on his pitifully small group

ENJOLRAS
Let us die facing our foes
Make them bleed while we can

COMBEFERRE
Makeem pay through the nose

COURFEYRAC
Makeem pay for every man
ENJOLRAS
Let others rise to take our place
Until the earth is free

The sun now appears above the rooftops of the city
And the big guns fire - BOOM BOOM BOOM

The bombardment hits the barricade rocking it In its wake
a massive barrage of musket fire

The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst
right through in the first hit

Bullets fly and every few moments another cannon ball
smashes into the piled debris Javert is glimpsed among the
attackers

Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the
barricades firing at the attackers handing their rifles
down to others to be re-loaded firing again

Valjean moves among them tending to the wounded lifting
down the dead regardless of his own safety

Marius takes a bullet and crumples and falls Valjean runs
towards him -

CRASH The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade
and now the soldiers are storming through The hard core of
student fighters retreat firing as they go into the Café
Musain

97 INT CAFE MUSAIN - DAY 97

Students and soldiers fight in the café on the stairs up
the stairs to the upper room Students driving back the
pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase smashing it
to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them -
students fall their bodies caught on the jagged remnants
of the stairs Grantaire is still unconscious from drink

98 EXT BARRICADE - DAY 98

Valjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the
onrush of the soldiers -

INT CAFE MUSAIN - DAY

The students’ ammunition has run out theyre hurling
sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to
clamber up shooting as they come and one by one the
students are falling

EXT STREET OUTSIDE CAFE MUSAIN - DAY
Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage A soldier

challenges him One violent blow from Valjean sends the
soldier flying -

INT CAFE MUSAIN - DAY

The soldiers break through at last to the upper room to find

theres only Enjolras still alive He stands by the window
knowing he will die now proud and unafraid Seeing him the
soldiers hesitate The sudden silence wakes Grantaire from
his drunken slumber

GRANTAIRE
Long live the republic

He sees Enjolras with the muskets raised against him

Grantaire goes and joins him Enjolras smiles and raises his

now-ragged red flag

The rifles blaze Grantaire drops back to the ground
Enjolras falls back -

EXT BARRICADE - DAY

Enjolras falling backwards out of the window until he
hangs upside down the red flag still in his hands
streaming like blood down the wall

PULL BACK to see the street littered with corpses and the
remains of the barricade and soldiers scouring the rubble
for any last pockets of resistance

BACK AND BACK to come to a stop looking at the wide scene

INTO FRAME walks Javert grimly surveying the victory of
law over rebellion

EXT BACK ALLEY - DAY

Valjean carries Marius down a long narrow alley that runs
between the backs of tall houses The alley turns a corner -
and there ahead is a dead end Behind him the stamp of
soldiers boots Ahead no way out

Then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the
ground A storm drain

ON THE SOLDIERS - As they come round the corner into the
end of the alley They look round Its empty

SOLDIER
Nothing here

The soldiers depart A moment of silence

Then into the alleys end steps Javert Not so easily
fooled He walks all the way to the end and looks round
He sees the drain at his feet He sees the signs that the
grating has been lifted

He stoops and tries to lift it Its far too heavy for
him

He straightens up and looks round calculating Where does
the drain lead

104 INT PARIS SEWERS - DAY 104

Valjean is pulling Marius after him down a tight sloping
pipe where dark water races Suddenly they start to slide
then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel Faint
light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls The
skitter of rats Sodden forms floating by dead bodies

Valjean carries Marius down the tunnel moving as fast as
he can losing strength all the time He reaches an
intersection where four sewers meet Light falls through
distant gratings One of the four sewers is dry Here he
lets his burden down and himself sinks to the slimy ground
to rest He lets his eyes close

A voice echoes in the shadows

THENARD IER
Heres a hint of gold
Stuck into a tooth -
Pardon me msieur
You wont be needing it no more
Shouldnt be too hard to sell

A figure coming closer A sewer thief robbing corpses No
sign of life in either Valjean or Marius

THENARD IER
Well someones got to cleanem
up my friends
Before the little harvest
Disappears into the mud
Someones got to collect their
odds and ends
When the gutters run with blood

Now we see the thief is Thenardier He finds a ring on
Mariuss finger and pulls it off

THENARD IER
Heres a tasty ring
Pretty little thing
Hearts no longer going
And hes lived his little time
But his watch is ticking yet

Its a world where the dog eats
the dog

Where they kill for the bones in
the street

And God in his heaven

He dont interfere

Cos hes dead as the stiff at my
feet

raise my eyes to see the
heavens

And only the moon looks down
The harvest moon shines down

Valjean wakes rears up seizes Thenardier by the arm
slams him against the sewer wall

VALJEAN
How do I get out of here

THENARD IER
There That way

Valjean drops him picks Marius up once more and sets off

Thenardier stares after them grinning Hes sent then the
wrong way
LATER - Valjean in the sewers Marius on his back and
theyre sinking ever deeper into the slimy water

As he feels himself sink Valjean holds Marius up in his
arms and forges on chest deep lifting the younger man
above his head Still he sinks until his face is half-
submerged and hes gagging in the filth He stumbles and
suddenly hes sunk beneath the surface and Marius is
dropping -

Then up he bursts again face black with slime eyes
burning with his refusal to be beaten

LATER - Valjean staggers down the endless sewers Marius on
his back But all the time he can hear closer now the
rushing sound of the river

Round a bend and at last - moonlight ahead

He drags himself on through the shallow running water
towards the moonlight

He reaches the exit at last Before him the river

EXT RIVER EMBANKMENT PARIS - NIGHT

Valjean crusted with slime heaves Marius out of the sewer
onto the embankment that runs beside the river

He looks up There staring at him is Javert

Valjean rises slowly Heaves Marius up onto his back once
more The strain of the night is showing Hes a man near
the end of his strength

VALJEAN

ts you Javert

knew you wouldnt wait too
long
The faithful servant at his post
once more
This mans done no wrong
And he needs his familys care

JAVERT
warned you I would not give in
wont be swayed

VALJEAN
Another hour yet
And then Im yours
And all our debts are paid

JAVERT
The man of mercy comes again
And talks of justice

VALJEAN
Come time is running short -
Look down Javert
Hes standing in his grave

He starts to move past Javert
Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjeans head

JAVERT
One more step and you die

Valjean meets his eyes That old battle of will against
will

VALJEAN
Then I die

He starts walking past Javert Javerts hand trembles as it
holds the pistol

Valjean keeps walking Javert wills himself to shoot but
he just cant do it Frustrated enraged with himself he
lowers the gun

JAVERT
Take him Valjean
Before I change my mind

I will be waiting
24601

He turns away trembling now all up and down his body He
stares into the river Valjean is gone now Hes alone

JAVERT
Who is this man
What sort of devil is he
To have caught me in a trap
And choose to let me go free
It was his hour at last
To put a seal on my fate
Wipe out the past

And wash me clean off the slate
All it would take

Was a flick of his knife
Vengeance was his

And he gave me back my life

He begins to move away along the embankment up steps
towards a bridge Hes unaware of everything except the

turmoil in his brain

JAVERT
Damned if I live in the debt of a
thief
Damned if I yield at the end of
the chase

JAVERT (contd)
am the law and the law is not

mocked

ll spit his pity right back in
his face
There is nothing on earth that we
share

t is either Valjean or Javert
How can I allow this man

To hold dominion over me

This desperate man that I have
hunted

He gave me my life He gave me
freedom

fq

I should have perished by his
hand

It was his right

It was my right to die as well
Instead I live But live in
hell

He moves up from the embankment onto the bridge

Here he

stands looking down at the dark water of the night river
The Seine forms a whirlpool here where violent currents

swirl round the piles of the bridge

JAVERT
And my thoughts fly apart
Can this man be believed
Shall his sins be forgiven
Shall his crimes be reprieved
And must I now begin to doubt
ho never doubted all those
ears

y heart is stone and still it
rembles

he world I have known is lost in
hadow

s he from heaven or from hell
nd does he know

hat granting me my life today
his man has killed me even so

HHPHHHIA RY S

He climbs up onto the parapet reaching his arms up to the
night sky

JAVERT
I am reaching but I fall
And the stars are black and cold
As I stare into the void
Of a world that cannot hold

Ill escape now from that world
From the world of Jean Valjean
This is nowhere I can turn
There is no way to go on

He reaches higher turning his body twisting as if he
wants some angel from on high to save him - and so
turning he falls into the river The swirling eddies close
over him And hes lost

EXT STREET OUTSIDE CAFE MUSAIN - DAY

Soldiers are dismantling the last of the barricade Women
move about the street seeking their dead loved ones among
the bodies that still litter the barricade These are both
the middle-class mothers of the students - Enjolrass
mother Grantaires sister - and the working women of the
slums for whom they died united now in their grief

WOMAN 1
Did you see them
Going off to fight

WOMAN 2
Children of the barricade
Who didnt last the night
WOMAN 3
Did you see them
Lying where they died
Someone used to cradle them
And kiss them when they cried

WOMAN 4
Did you see them lying side by
side

WOMAN 5

Who will wake them

WOMAN 6
No one ever will

WOMAN 2
No one ever told them that
A summer day can kill

WOMAN 7
They were schoolboys
Never held a gun
Fighting for a new world that
Would rise up like the sun

WOMAN 3
Wheres that new world
Now the fightings done

The women move off to go about their days business

107 INT MARIUSS FAMILY HOUSE PARIS - DAY

CLOSE ON MARIUS - Hes waking from the nightmare finding
himself in a fine bed with clean linen He looks round a
handsome room

GILLENORMAND
Marius Youve come back to us

Marius recognises the old man anxiously watching him his
grandfather Monsieur GILLENORMAND

MARIUS
Grandfather

He struggles to rise but he lacks the strength His
grandfathers face shows only love and concern
GILLENORMAND
Rest Marius No more harsh words
between us I just thank God
youre alive

Timidly the old man comes closer to the bed Tears form in
Mariuss eyes Encouraged the old man takes Mariuss hand
in his

GILLENORMAND
Youve come home To all of us

The distant voices of the mourning women -

WOMEN (0S)
Round and round
And back where you began

108 INT CAFE MUSAIN - DAY

Marius makes his way slowly up the stairs to the upper
room Hes still weak from his wounds He enters the room
where his friends died and looks round He sinks into a
chair

MARIUS
Theres a grief that cant be
spoken
Theres a pain goes on and on
Empty chairs at empty tables
Now my friends are dead and gone

He sees the bloodstain on the wall beneath the window sill
The blood of Enjolras

MARIUS
Here they talked of revolution
Here it was they lit the flame
Here they sang about tomorrow

MARIUS (contd)
And tomorrow never came

From the table in the corner

They could see a world reborn
And they rose with voices ringing
And I can hear them now
The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
On the lonely barricade at dawn

He looks out of the window at whats left of the barricade
He seems to see again the brave doomed defence the smoke
and the gunfire the young men falling

MARIUS
h my friends my friends
orgive me
hat I live and you are gone
heres a grief that cant be
poken
heres a pain goes on and on

Hu aHano

Phantom faces at the window
Phantom shadows on the floor
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will meet no
more

h my friends my friends dont
sk me

hat your sacrifice was for
mpty chairs at empty tables
here my friends will sing no
more

SHso 0

Slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway
There stands Cosette waiting for him

109 INT MARIUSS FAMILY HOUSE PARIS - DAY 109

Cosette holds Marius supporting him as he enters the
house

COSETTE
Every day
You walk with stronger step
You walk with longer step
The worst is over

MARIUS
Every day
I wonder every day
Who it was brought me here
From the barricade

Cosette leads him into the room where Valjean and
Gillenormand wait

COSETTE
Dont think about it Marius
With all the years ahead of us
I will never go away
And we will be together
Every day
Every day
Well remember that night
And the vow that we made

As Valjean and Gillenormand look on Marius and Cosette
sing their love to each other

COSETTE
A heart full of love
A night full of you
The words are old
But always true

VALJEAN
She was never mine to keep
She is youthful she is free

Not a dream after all

110 INT PARLOUR MARIUSS FAMILY HOUSE - DAY 110

Marius stands before Valjean alone in this more private
room

MARIUS
Msieur this is a day
I never can forget
Is gratitude enough
For giving me Cosette
Your home shall be with us
And not a day shall pass
But we will prove our love
To you whom we shall call
A father to us both
A father to us all

VALJEAN
Not another word my son
Theres something now that must
be done

Hes prepared himself to make this confession but its
still hard

VALJEAN
There lived a man whose name was
Jean Valjean
He stole some bread to save his
sisters son
For nineteen winters served his
time
In sweat he washed away his
crime

Marius hears this with shock

VALJEAN
Years ago
He broke parole and lived a life
apart
How could he tell Cosette and
break her heart
Its for Cosette this must be
faced
If he is caught she is
disgraced
The time has come to journey on
And from this day he must be
gone

Who am I

Who am I

MARIUS
Youre Jean Valjean

Marius cant conceal that hes disturbed by this
revelation

MARIUS
Monsieur you cannot leave
Whatever I tell my beloved
Cosette
She will never believe me

VALJEAN
Make her believe
have gone on a journey
A long way away
Tell her my heart was too full
for farewells -
t is better this way
Promise me Monsieur Cosette
will never know

MARIUS
give my word

VALJEAN
What I have spoken why I must
go

MARIUS
For the sake of Cosette it must
be so

EXT MARIUSS FAMILY HOUSE PARIS - DAY

A waiting cab Valjean comes out of the modest lodging
house and gets in The cab rattles away down the street

IN THE CAB - Valjean sits gazing far away at nothing Then
his weary eyes close
112 INT MARIUSS FAMILY HOUSE PARIS - DAY

Cosette gazes at Marius bewildered by what she has just
learned
COSETTE
Wheres he gone without a word
That wouldnt be his way to go
MARIUS
All he asked for me to say
Hes on a journey far away
Dear Cosette he loves you so
Perhaps he will return some day
Cosette comes into Mariuss arms tears in her eyes
COSETTE
He cant leave us now

Without him giving me away

Marius and Cosette newly married are walking towards
Marius house through an aisle created by wedding guests
Carriages line the street
WEDDING GUESTS

With peace and love
113 SCENE OMITTED

114 INT MARIUSS FAMILY HOUSE PARIS - DAY

Waltz music plays as Marius and Cosette lead the dancing at
the wedding reception
As the dance proceeds two extraordinary figures enter and
start helping themselves to the drink and the food They
are Thenardier and his wife dressed up for high society

MAJORDOMO
The Baron and Baroness du Thenard

They look round as the dance continues highly satisfied with
themselves and see Marius

Thenardier makes a mock-formal bow

THENARD IER
I forget where we met
Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge
Where the Duke did that Puke
Down the Duchesss decolletage

MARIUS
No Baron du Thenard
The circles I move in are humbler
by far
Go away Thenardier
Do you think I dont know who you
are

MADAME THENARDIER
Hes not fooled
Told you so
Show MSieur what youve come here
to show
Tell the boy what you know
LES MISERABLES BLUE REVISIONS 2052012 119A

THENARDIER
Pity to disturb you at a feast
like this
But 500 francs surely wouldnt
come amiss

MARIUS
In Gods name say what you have
to say

MADAME THENARDIER
(to Thenardier)
He speaks
(to Marius)
You pay
THENARDIER
What I saw clear as light
Jean Valjean in the sewers that
night
Had this corpse on his back
Some boy hed killed in a viscious
attack
I was there never fear
Even found me this fine souvenir

He shows off his ring Marius stares in astonishment

MARIUS
I know this This was mine
This is surely some heavenly sign

Thenardier steals the ring back

THENARDIER
And theres more Mark this well -
It was the night that the
barricades fell

MARIUS
Then its true Then Im right
Jean Valjean was my saviour that
night

Thenardier looks past Marius to where Cosette stands among
their friends He lowers his voice

THENARDIER
Jean Valjean - the old con
You pay up and Ill say where hes
gone

He takes out money and reluctantly presses it into
Thenardiers hands Madame Thenardier takes the money before
Thenardier has safely pocketed it

LES MISERABLES BLUE REVISIONS 2052012 120

MARIUS
Not so loud Heres for you
God forgive us the things that we
do

MADAME THENARDIER
Hows about some extra
On a day so glad
Our little orphan girl
She hasnt done so bad
Raised in a convent
Cash to spare —-
We want our share

Marius hands over yet more money to Madame Thenardier

THENARDIER
Quite the little nun aint she

CRACK Thenardier sinks to the ground felled by a powerful
blow from an angered Marius The band stops playing

MARIUS
Where is he

THENARDIER
(cowardly voice)
The convent

Marius rushes to Cosette and we see him telling her where
Valjean is They hurry away

Thenardier clambers to his feet helped by his wife He
gestures to the band to continue They stand by the tiered
wedding cake As Thenardier recovers his composure Madame
Thenardier steals one then two pillars from the cake so it
collapses on the floor She then pushes it under the table
with her foot

LES MISERABLES BLUE REVISIONS 2052012 121

THENARDIER
Aint it a laugh
Aint it a treat
Hob-nobbin here
Among the elite
Here comes a prince
There goes a Jew
This ones a queer
But what can you do
(pulling Madame Thenardier
onto the dance floor)
Paris at my feet
Paris in the dust
And heres me breaking bread
With the upper crust -

As he pivots Madame Thenardier stolen silver drops out from
Madame Thenardiers dress The music stops dead in the
clatter The Thenardiers look up as if implying that the
silver dropped from the ceiling The dance continues
Monsieur Gillenormand motions to the Majordomo to remove
these unwanted guests

THENARDIER
Beggar at the feast
Master of the dance
Life is easy pickings
If you grab your chance

MADAME THENARDIER
Everywhere you go
Law-abiding folk
Doing what is decent

THENARDIER
But theyre mostly broke

MADAME THENARDIER
Singing to the Lord on Sundays

THENARDIER
Praying for the gifts hell send -

THENARDIERMADAME THENARDIER
But were the ones who take it -
Were the ones who make it in the
end

The Thenardiers are carried off singing as they go

THENARDIER
Watch the buggers dance

MADAME THENARDIER
Watchem till they drop

And you stand on top

Cosette and Marius rush round the cloisters and enter the
chapel in the middle of the cloisters

116B INT CONVENT CHAPEL - NIGHT 116B

The sound of the door opening Valjean looks round Its
Cosette entering followed by Marius

VALJEAN
Cosette

Tears form in his eyes Cosette goes to him kneels before
him takes him in her arms

COSETTE
Papa papa I do not understand -
Are you all right Why did you go

away

VALJEAN
Cosette my child Am I forgiven
now

Thank God thank God Ive lived
to see this day
Marius comes to him

MARIUS
Its you who must forgive a
thoughtless fool
Its you who must forgive a
thankless man
Its thanks to you that I am
living
And again I lay down my life at
your feet
Cosette your father is a saint
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home to you

VALJEAN
Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

COSETTE
You will live papa
Youre going to live
Its too soon
Too soon to say goodbye

VALJEAN
Yes Cosette forbid me now to
die
Ill obey
I will try

He holds out a letter for her

VALJEAN
On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well
When I at last am sleeping
Its the story
Of one who turned from hating
A man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping

Cosette takes the letter and kisses it
COSETTE
I know it papa

Valjean turns back face shining towards the table where
the candles burn in the silver candlesticks There he sees
three ghosts waiting for him The ghost of the Bishop The
ghost of Fantine And beyond her watching Marius with
love the ghost of Eponine

Fantine comes towards him reaching out her hands

VALJEAN
Im ready now Fantine

FANTINE
Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last at last behind you
Lord in heaven
Look down on him in mercy -

VALJEAN
Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory

Cosette embraces Valjean weeping

Valjean reaches up his hands and lets the ghost of Fantine
take them

FANTINEEPONINE
Take my hand
Ill lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting

VALJEAN FANTINEEPONINEBISHOP
And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God

Led by Fantine Valjean walks out of the Chapel towards the
cloister

What remains is Cosette her head cradled in the lap of the
man who has just died
The walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles
The Bishop of Digne waits in front of the candles Now
Valjeans strong and young again Before they reach the
wall of candles all three are gone

As they disappear we CRANE UP high over the cloister high
over the walls of the Convent and we see the Paris streets
outside Fires are burning and debris is scattered in the
streets Dawn is breaking

From far away the sound of an approaching crowd -

117 EXT PLACE DE LA BASTILLE - DAY 117

THE CAMERA MOVES over the cobbles as the light of the
rising sun reveals the devastation left by a bitter street
battle Past the remains of a barricade

The distant sound of an approaching march
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION

Sixteen years later
Paris 1848

From far off the swelling sounds of the approaching march
become the words of a song

MARCHERS
Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light
For the wretched of the earth

MARCHERS (contd)
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise

As THE CAMERA RISES we see were in the Place de la
Bastille The triumphal column has long been completed but
the great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become
incorporated into an immense barricade - three stories
high seven hundred feet long Down all the streets that
converge on the square we now see the multiple victory
marches approaching They cheer and beat drums as they
climb up to the top of the barricade
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTIONS

The people of Paris have risen in
their tens of thousands

The King has fled A new Republic
is born

There in the forefront of one column march Marius and
Cosette

MARCHERS
They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
They will walk behind the plough-
share
They will put away the sword
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their
reward

As the marchers come nearer we begin to realise how many
there are thousand upon thousand And there marching among
them we see ghosts from the past - Enjolras and the
students who died - and Fantine - and Eponine -

And out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost the
grinning face of Gavroche He climbs out to dance on the
elephant as the crowd fill the square

MARCHERS
Will you join in our crusade
Who will be strong and stand with
me
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see

As the marchers converge there watching them are
Thenardier and his wife Thenardier gives the marchers a
wave of greeting Survivors to the last

MARCHERS
Do you hear the people sing
Say do you hear the distant
drums

MARCHERS (contd)
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes
Now among the marchers we see the ghost of Valjean
with the rest atop the barricade

flags

MARCHERS
Will you join in our crusade
Who will be strong and stand with
me
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see
Do you hear the people sing
Say do you hear the distant
drums
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
