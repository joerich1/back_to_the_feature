She picks up her suitcase Steps out the door quickly

Before Marion shuts the door she glances back -- And sees
YOUNG TOM slumped at the table

She walks to the mini cab Hands over her bag And climbs
inside The car drives off

streets lined with bungalows

through the house

DOWN THE CORRIDOR -- Sunlight from the spare bedroom makes a
rectangle of light on the floor and opposite wall

Tom walks toward it

driven out of Peacehaven

Patrick in his chair Taking in what he can see of the sea
view from the sun-blasted window

A shadow falls over his knees He looks up SEES TOM

Who stands awkwardly in the doorway Eyes meet Tom waits
there Feeling awkward ashamed Frightened

But Patrick offers a crooked smile

WHITE SHOOTING 4-6-21 p102
Tom enters Sits on the bed Hand resting on his knee
Patrick reaches for Toms hand Holds it in a grip stronger
than Tom expects
INT MINI CABCOASTAL ROAD - DAY - 1999 155
Marion rides in the back

The grey sky has broken Sunlight cuts through the window

INTEXT MINI CABCOASTAL ROAD - CONTINUOUS - 1999 156

Finally the car leaves the town behind offering a clear view
of landscape and sea

The mini cab winds along bluffs toward the train station
The sun warms Marions face and gives her courage
