trying
to force his team to pull the vehicle up the bank is
too
occupied to recognize the women at once Having made
just
enough room for the surrey he turns and looks at the
women
GRAHAM
All right --
(then surprised)
What are you girls doin way out
here
Mary looks ahead at the narrow road and the canyon to
her

MARY
Until you came along we were going
to Sonora

GRAHAM
What do you know about that Did you
sell your place

MARY

GRAHAM
They were murdered I found the bodies

GRAHAM
Why back to Aspen where you came

MARY
Aspen doesnt want us Mr Graham
They threw us out

GRAHAM

They shouldnt have done that

MARY
We tried to point that out But there
were some pretty nosey citizens who
wouldnt listen to reason They said
Aspen had outgrown us Its all right
to play poker in your own home but
not in a saloon

GRAHAM
(sadly)
I knew something would happen when
they started puttin up fences and
passin laws

Mary unwraps the reins from the whipstock

bellows and watching his brother a freckled kid of
trying to roll a cigarette Steve has progressed to the

difficult step that of licking and sealing the paper

cylinder in his mouth and Steve lights it for him The

third of the cigarette burns with one quick flare

STEVE
How does she draw
