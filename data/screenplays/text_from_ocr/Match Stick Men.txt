ROY
Here use my pen

As the Husbands eyes glaze over the small print the DOG
SCRATCHES at the door again

HUSBAND
Let him out will ya Carolyn

The Housewife slides open a glass door for the dog then
returns to her seat -- without closing it behind her
Roys focus fixes on it And every voice drifts into
the distance

ROY
All we need is the name of your
bank your account number and your

fixated on the small wilderness outside -- and recognizes

the cause of his infirmity the open door

FRANK
Do you mind if I close this

They dont Frank rises and closes the glass door Roy
snaps out of it Sound within the room returns to normal

INT DR KLEINS OFFICE - DAY 37

Roy at the far end of a small couch stares at a pair of
Florsheims crossed atop an ottoman They belong to DR
KLEIN who scans Roys form

helps my back

ROY
Go ahead

DR KLEIN
(re his form)
Youre something of a clean slate

to say

Klein smiles Roy doesnt

ROY
Yes I was getting them
illegally

DR KLEIN

ROY

So I wouldnt have to talk to
someone like you Do you know
what they were

DR KLEIN

DR KLEIN
You certainly get to the point

ROY
And you skirt it Can you get me
the pills or not

DR KLEIN
Yes

ROY
Then lets get that prescription
pad out

DR KLEIN

Roy usually I dont prescribe
medicine unless Ive had a little
chat with the patient first If
youre inclined against that
then-- as you say -- this session
will be quite brief

Roy stares the doctor down Klein never blinks

DR KLEIN
It says here youre an antiques
dealer How long you been in that
line

Nothing from Roy The face-off continues

DR KLEIN
Would you like to tell me whats
been bothering you

And continues Then abruptly Roy quits

ROY
I get tired a lot but I cant
sleep Certain things distract
me make me feel sick to my
stomach

DR KLEIN
What kinds of things

ROY
When people leave doors open or
windows I dont like being
outdoors They call that
agoraphobia right

DR KLEIN
Incorrectly but yes Anything

‘cause shed been down that path
before

(a breath to cool

his temper)
Doc I spent last Tuesday on my
living room sofa Watching my
carpet Watching fibers on my
carpet And the whole time I was
watching my carpet I was worrying
that I might vomit and the whole
time I was worrying I might vomit
I was thinking I’m a grown man
I should know whats going on in
my head And the more I thought
about it the more I realized I
should just blow my brains out and
end it all but the more I wanted
to blow my brains out the more I
thought about what that would do
to my goddamn carpet

(beat)
And that was a good day Doc So
gimme some pills and let me get on
with my life

Roy watches her scratch away with all her might

ROY

Just the right
(beat)

Okay Most important thing you
have to understand about this game
is ninety percent of it is
variable No matter how good your
plan is you almost always get
thrown a curveball So you have
to be flexible prepared to roll
with anything The one thing you
can control though is who your
mark is Thats your ten percent

EXT ROYS HOME - DAY 190

Roy pulls his Caprice up the driveway and gets out
Groceries in hand he heads to the front door unlocks
it enters

Turning to look inside the house THROUGH the front
windows for the first time open and unencumbered by
shades Roy walks into the living room A new carpet
replaces the old He pays it no mind He leafs through
mail calls out a name then turns as --

-- Kathy enters from the kitchen wiping her hands clean
on a dishrag She smiles and Roy smiles too explaining
what he got at the market and opening his market bag wide
for her to see She rubs his head nice job then
kisses him and he kisses back --

-- and when they break she whispers sweetly in his ear
and he smiles even more He looks down to lay his palm
gently on her belly They go into dinner

FADE OUT
