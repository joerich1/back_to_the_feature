INT AMHERST COLLEGE ENGLISH CLASSROOM - MORNING

An eclectic group of freshman English students sit around a
large conference table chatting LAUREN POWELL 18 prim
proper and wide-eyed notices KATIE STEELE 18 wearing a see-
through top with a black bra Lauren leans over

LAUREN

(whispering)
I can see your bra through your
shirt

(off Katie’s nod)
It’s just that you don’t want
people to think you’re a slut on
the first day of school

KATIE
Oh Hey do you mind if people
think you’re a frosty bitch

PROFESSOR RAINEY attractive and 35 walks to the head of the
table wearing a smart sweater vest

PROFESSOR RAINEY
This is freshman English We write
we read we talk We should get to
know each other

Lauren starts taking notes JESSE LAWSON 18 a gay bear
type hurries inside and sits between Katie and Lauren

LAUREN
(whispers as she writes)
Know each other

PROFESSOR RAINEY
I’m Tate Rainey and I’m from
Jacksonville Florida One of the
hardest things I’ve overcome is
that although my penis is straight
my ass is gay

The class shoots to attention A few laughs trickle out

JESSE
(quietly to Katie)
Score
(notices Lauren’s
horrified look)
Kidding I like your headband
They smile at each other Professor Rainey continues

PROFESSOR RAINEY
See The ice is broken And I’m
kidding I’m not gay at all But in
college we can say whatever we
want Now something I really did
overcome is writer’s block after my
divorce Not exciting kinda sad
but true Who’s next

Lauren shoots her hand into the air and stands up

LAUREN

I’ll go My name is Lauren Powell
and I’m from Stamford Connecticut
And it was so hard for me to
overcome my craving for ice cream
sundaes My dad made me one every
night until high school when I had
to stop cause I watched my weight

There are mostly eye-rolls but it’s so sweet a few people
smile The biggest eye roll comes from Katie who pipes up

KATIE
Ill go next

Lauren awkwardly sits Katie remains seated

KATIE (CONTD)
My name is Katie Steele and I’m
from Baltimore Maryland Something
I had to overcome is a misdemeanor
I got for flashing at a high school
football game

JESSE
You can get arrested for flashing

KATIE
You do when it’s your vag And I’m
18 now so it’s not on my record
anymore I’ve overcome

The class explodes with laughter Over Jesse the two girls
stare each other down as another student starts talking
INT FRATERNITY HOUSE - EVENING

Lauren wearing an Amherst shirt wanders through the

crowded smokey room carrying an empty diet Coke can She
taps a DUDE on his shoulder
LAUREN
Excuse me do you know where the
recycling is

The DUDE ignores Lauren She taps another person on the
shoulder When she turns around it’s Katie who double fists
beers and wears an outrageous and very revealing outfit

LAUREN (CONTD)
(earnestly)
Oh hi Hey I hope you’re keeping
your skirt on at this party

KATIE
I’m just hoping they’1ll have ice
cream later

LAUREN
(ignoring the insult)
Do you know if there’s any
recycling around

KATIE
Recycling This is a party earth
girl

She grabs Lauren’s can and throws it on the floor

KATIE (CONT’D)
(tousles Lauren’s hair)
Now you go have the time of your
life

Lauren gives Katie a judging look while Katie hurls herself
onto the keg to do a kegstand

INTEXT LAUREN’S CAR - A LITTLE LATER THAT NIGHT

Lauren drives away from the now broken-up party She sees
Katie doing the electric slide on the sidewalk stumbling in
her giant wedges - her revealing outfit almost revealing too
much She’s wasted and has a party of her own Lauren watches
Katie and debates picking her up The good person in her wins
and she rolls down her window

LAUREN
Hey

KATIE
Lauren Powell Fan of the ice cream
sundae
LAUREN
Yes that’s me Do you maybe need a
ride

Katie shrugs and then hurls herself into Lauren’s car and
immediately starts playing with the radio

KATIE
Ugh I hate Dave Matthews What
station is this

LAUREN
It’s acd actually But this is a
live cd Have you ever seen Dave
live Or were you busy showing off
your girl parts

Katie is almost impressed by the insult

KATIE
Oh man I just realized I haven’t
peed in like four beers
(sees a big gulp cup)
Is this yours

LAUREN
Sorry I think it’s empty

KATIE
Perfect

Katie jiggles off her underwear and tosses them on the dash
She starts to maneuver herself over the cup

LAUREN
What are you doing

KATIE
I told you I had to pee

LAUREN
Stop You can’t do that This is my
new car

KATIE

Oh come on I do this all the time

The sounds of Katie’s pee can be heard hitting the cup
LAUREN (CONTD)
Ohmygod ohmygod I can’t believe

Katie finishes up and holds the cup up triumphantly

KATIE
Finished See no spills at all

Lauren sighs

LAUREN
Fine Okay

Katie starts to put the lid back on the cup

KATIE
I told you I do this all the--

SPLASH Lauren hits a bump and pee goes everywhere SILENCE

Lauren pulls the car over to the side of the road The area
couldnt be scarier and is populated by SHADY LOOKING DUDES
SMALL CHILDREN selling drugs and a PROSTITUTE getting
spanked right there on the sidewalk

LAUREN
Get out

KATIE
Here

LAUREN

(firmer)

Get out

KATIE

LAUREN
(re the spanked
prostitute)

Oh I think youll fit right in with

Katie collects her shoes and what’s left of the pee-filled cup
and teeters out of the car Lauren speeds off and then veers
back in reverse She tosses Katie’s panties at her head

LAUREN (CONTD)
I HATE YOU
KATIE
Fine I HATE you too And you should
just chill out Urine is sterile

Lauren speeds off leaving Katie in Scarytown Unfortunately
for her Katie’s revealing outfit makes her fit right in

THE SPANKER
(to Katie)

INT BROOKLYN APARTMENT- DAY

Katie stands in the middle of an empty living room with the
BUILDING MANAGER She shrugs

KATIE
It’snot bad I came in a taxi
today but how far is the train

BUILDING MANAGER
10 blocks to the J-M-Z train And
then you just switch to the L train
or the F train after 6 stops and it
gets you right into the city

KATIE
Huh How long does it take exactly

BUILDING MANAGER
An hour But there’s lots of people
that commute from here or take
bikes to the train

Katie peers out the window as a DELINQUENT cuts off a bike
lock and steals a bike peddling away at the speed of light

broker EILEEN a mid-40’s Jewish-mom type smiles broadly

house)
And I just live right there

JESSE (CONT’D)
Hey you

KATIE

INT BEDROOM 2 IN THE AMAZING APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
Lauren looks dreamily at the large closet in the bedroom

JESSE

I don’t want to live with a
stranger Wait are you thinking
about it

The girls look at each other with hatred until Lauren
remembers her manners

Jesse chokes back a laugh then nods

LAUREN

them)

Cute frames with nothing inside

small table by the large windows

KATIE
You just described Monica and
Rachel’s apartment

LAUREN
I love brunch

KATIE

JESSE

apartment for someone fresh out of
college This is for someone who’s
got their shit together Someone
who’s making their life happen
This place is for the two of you
Now on the count of three I want
you to both open your eyes and
forgive each other for your silly
pasts and get ready to step into
the future of your incredible
apartment One Two Three

The girls open their eyes

LAUREN

out into a world full of murderers
rapists and drug dealers

LAUREN
When it’s hot outside my parents
say that the car still smells like
pee

KATIE
I was almost arrested that night
for being a prostitute

LAUREN
You peed in my car

KATIE

They angrily part ways As they head for the door they
overhear JACK the real estate broker talking to MARIA
another interested person

Both Katie and Lauren’s eyes grow wide They rush over

LAUREN
But I’ve worked as your assistant

EXT TIMES SQUARE - A BIT LATER

Lauren wearing a proper shirt and her pajama pants fights
her way through times square while drowning her sorrows in an
extra large bag of chocolate covered popcorn Some of it’s on
her face

Meanwhile only a few feet away is Katie Her power blazer is
now wrapped around her waist She hands a YOUNG MAN a flier

KATIE
Hey you like comedy
(off the man’s confused
look)
English
(more confusion)
No Great

She hands him the flier and then pushes her way through the
crowd She doesn’t know it’s her but she taps Lauren on the
shoulder

KATIE (CONTD)
Hey pajamas you like comedy

Lauren turns around and sees that it’s Katie Both of them
are shocked

KATIE (CONT’D)
Oh It’s you

Lauren grabs the flier

LAUREN
Is this your job

KATIE

No Yes It’s a grass roots campaign
You can’t ask anyone to do anything
you wouldn’t do yourself

(judge-y )

I see

LAUREN

Katie registers the pajamas and the fact that it’s mid-day

KATIE

What’s with the popcorn and

pajamas

LAUREN

Thisis part of a major book deal
I’m brokering Yeah

KATIE
You’re such a liar

LAUREN
Youre not doing anything
ground-breaking in
advertising

The girls stare each other down Lauren breaks first

LAUREN (CONTD)

Fine Morty retired I lost my job

Katie almost feels bad but then takes advantage

KATIE

And this is how Miss productive
fills her time

LAUREN

Yeah clearly I should take notes
from you on how to have a
successful career

KATIE

If you’ll excuse me I have some
important work to get done

LAUREN

Why not save your breath and just
wear a sandwich board

KATIE

Unemployed

They both turn and huff off in opposite directions

KATIE (CONT’D)
You better be able to pay your rent
next month

LAUREN
Madison Avenue is that way

INT KATIE AND LAUREN’S APARTMENT - LAUREN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Lauren still in her pajamas is splayed across her bed with a
pile of gossip rags She listens to her iPod but then
casually pulls it out of her ears and stands up She shoots
to attention when she hears

KATIE (0S)
(sexually)
Mmmm Oh yeah That’s it

Lauren’s eyes go wide

KATIE (0S) (CONT’D)

her purse and heads for the door

INT FANCY LOUNGE- NIGHT

Lauren stares at Jesse who sits across from her He takes a
big sip of his way too girly drink and sets it down

LAUREN
Youre not going to say anything

JESSE
Am I surprised she talks dirty when
she’s getting some action No not
really

LAUREN
How can you even like her She’s
disgusting and rude and socially
inept She can’t even be fake nice

JESSE
Is it possible that you’re upset
about getting fired and how your
dream of taking over Morty’s
clients has been crushed And maybe
Katie isn’t the problem

LAUREN

No That is not possible I am fully
qualified to work somewhere else and
I will This is a minor setback But
that girl ooooh I loathe her She
lies about everything She doesn’t
work in advertising She Hands
Out Fliers And you didn’t tell me

JESSE
Please don’t put me in the middle
She’s great at handing out those
fliers she’s talkative and
outgoing Give her that at least

LAUREN
I am not giving that girl anything
I just hope I don’t have to meet
whoever she’s sleeping with when he
comes out of our bathroom and has
inevitably peed on our floor
fondled my toothbrush and left
small curly hairs by the sink I’m
sure he’s disgusting

JESSE
Youre the one wearing pajama pants
in a bar

INT LAUREN’S BEDROOM- A LITTLE LATER

KATIE

fine but just a little warning
would be appreciated

KATIE
NO ONE WAS HERE

LAUREN
Whatever Could you clean some of
your moldy mushu pork out of our
fridge

KATIE
Why To make room for your veggie
dogs and soy milk What sort of a
person pickles their own beets

LAUREN
The type that values nutrition has
a real job and a basic sense of
cleanliness

KATIE

(slams her bowl of cereal

into the sink)
Real job As I recall you’re
REALLY UNEMPLOYED Hey you know I

briefcase and slams the door shut

INT KATIE AND LAUREN’S APARTMENT KITCHEN - EVENING

Lauren pushes Katie’s moldy food around in the fridge She
starts taking anything edible out and piles it on the
counter Once there’s a pile of very random foods on the
counter she digs in She takes a bite of a peach a spoonful
of peanut butter a pickle

LAUREN
Mmmm You’re a good little peach
Bet you wouldn’t mind a little of
this

Lauren tops her peach with some peanut butter and takes a big
bite She sighs with pleasure Just then Katie’s voice is
heard from inside her bedroom

Rip off those pants I can’t wait
to get inside there

LAUREN

Ohmygod
KATIE (0S)

through the door and hear the slight noise of mattress
springs getting a workout

LAUREN (CONTD)
Ugh grooossss I can’t do this

She turns to walk away

KATIE
You got me soooo wet THAT’S WHAT
I’M TALKING ABOUT

Lauren storms back to the door and POUNDS it with her fist
Unexpectedly it flies open It reveals Katie all alone in
the room fully clothed jumping up and down on her bed with
the phone to her ear

Lauren is stunned Katie’s face goes white
KATIE (INTO THE PHONE) (CONTD)
(quickly)
Uh just cum on my face Gotta go

Katie looks at Lauren wondering what she’s going to say
Lauren is silent

KATIE (CONT’D)

INT KATIE AND LAUREN’S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

her from the pedicurists chair

Listen I’ve been doing-- Oh I know what you’ve been
doing
KATIE LAUREN
If you would only let-- You are so disgust--
KATIE LAUREN
It’s not even a big-- How could you even--

The phone rings from inside Katie’s room

LAUREN
Well are you gonna get it Miss
Cleo

KATIE

Miss Cleo is a phone psychic

I enact phone fantasies
(Lauren is silent)

Fine Do you want the story

LAUREN
Sure Story me away

KATIE

Ok When I first got to New York I
had no money I didn’t have a grand
plan like I’m sure you did OK

(Lauren nods)
I saw an ad for a dirty hotline and
had a little phone interview and I
got the job I’m creative and am
really good at knowing what guys
want to hear so I was great at it
I did it for a while and then
stopped when my grandma died and I
got her place with rent control
But then we moved in here I needed
to make more money for my half of
the rent so I got back into it

(sincerely)
It’s the only thing I’ve been good
at since college Obviously I
don’t really have a fancy
advertising job

Lauren takes a deep breath

LAUREN
So how does it work How do you
get the calls

KATIE
It’s easy I just call tell them
when I’m “on” and they forward the
calls I get 2 bucks a minute
which adds up to be just enough to
cover my half of the rent

LAUREN
200 a minute How much are these
guys paying

KATIE
I think 699 I know how can they
afford it right It’s a decent
living for me though Except that I
always go over on my cell minutes

Lauren’s logical side takes over

LAUREN
Ok first off get a landline Are
you retarded

(MORE)

LAUREN (CONTD)
And listen I think you should know
if you’re really good at it you’re
wasting your time getting only 2
bucks a minute You’re the one
doing all the work and this stupid
company is making 3 times as much
as you for doing nothing It’s
actually offensive how short-
sighted you are Get your own
hotline

KATIE
Ok rude I’ve thought of that But
I just don’t know how to even begin

LAUREN
Whatever You’re just lazy Call
the phone company Tell your
clients Done
(off Katie’s enlightened
look)
Sohow do you know what to say

KATIE
Uhm I just say what I normally say
during sex I know every button on
a man and just when to push When
to cradle his-

Lauren puts a hand up to get Katie to stop talking

LAUREN
Maybe I don’t really want to know

KATIE
You must know some dirty words Did
you talk during sex with Charlie

LAUREN
Um I would tell him he’s sexy

KATIE
I need a cold shower after that one

The phone rings again from Katie’s bedroom

KATIE (CONTD)
Just so you know I’m going to keep
doing this I have a gift And if I
don’t I can’t pay my half of the
rent But I’1ll try to keep it down

Katie slips in her room and shuts the door Lauren shakes her
head and then laughs to herself

INT KATIE AND LAUREN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Lauren sits on the couch reading the Random House website
Katie breezes through the front door holding a large shopping
bag and heads to her room

KATIE

Lauren rolls her eyes Katie strolls back into the living
room holding a pink telephone

KATIE (CONTD)
Yes he did And look what I bought

Lauren barely looks up

LAUREN
Great

Katie sits down and stares at Lauren reading

LAUREN (CONTD)

KATIE

stuff Help me and Ill pay a
hundred bucks of your rent until

LAUREN

habit If it helps you pay the
rent fine Keep it quiet keep it

about it

Lauren starts to build speed as she answers Rachel tries to
keep up

LAUREN
Uhm she’s a listener I mean she
works on the phone But god she’s
not a telemarketer or anything I
hate those people I guess she’s
pretty good at it She says she’s
creative but I don’t really know
I mean who knows what she says to
those people Or how she can even
sleep with herself at night At
least she can pay her half of the
rent I meant right And I can’t
imagine what they say to her But
let me tell you she can be loud I
guess you’d have to be though To
say that kind of stuff I’m so
better than that This is way more
my speed I’m perfect for this
place right I could never do
phone sex

As soon as the words are out Lauren realizes what she’s
said

LAUREN (CONTD)

Oh god I didn’t mean to say that
I’m just really nervous Please

stops in front of some vibrators She picks up one that says
“MY FIRST VIBRATOR Perfect for beginners virgins and

tournaments

KATIE

(sarcastic)
Weird that you’d have to call up a
phone sex line just to meet a girl

She smiles He loves it

SEAN
So maybe the ladies werent as
turned on by it as I would have
hopedListen I know it’s weird
that I called a phone sex line
This only makes me more of a loser
but my high school girlfriend went
to BU and I went to USC-- we had a
lot of phone calls and you know
After we broke up it was just what
I was used to So I do it here and
there when I’m lonely And then
there was you And your line feels
safe Cause some of that shit out
there is nuts

She winks and rolls a ball She gets 20 points

SEAN (CONT’D)
Let me show you how it’s done

He walks over behind her and grabs her hand that has a ball
in it He helps her throw it She gets 50 They cheer

Then for your first time just be
in love And after that just have
fun And I was neverin love Or
no one was in love with me I don’t
know I created this whole fake slut
thing cause I was embarrassed and
it got so out of control And now
men just expect it and I clam up
andI’m scared now That I won’t
be good at it

LAUREN
But what about Dripping hole
clenches

KATIE

Lauren takes a deep breath She sits down next to Katie

LAUREN

shocked

Katie whimpers

LAUREN (CONTD)
Oh Katie Okay you know what
Tina Fey lost her virginity at like

at sex

(MORE)

LAUREN (CONTD)
Trust me if your body can keep up
with your mouth you’ll be mind-
blowing And being in love when you
do it That’1ll only make it better
If Sean is a great guy he’1ll wait
and it will be so much better than
having your first time with just
anyone It will have been worth the
wait I’m soproud of you

KATIE
Did your mom say that to you when
you told her you were a virgin

LAUREN
My mom doesn’t even think girls
should say the word vagina

KATIE
I’m such a loser

LAUREN
Listen You didn’t see yourself
as a virgin at 28 But I didn’t see
myself as a phone sex operator

KATIE
It isn’t exactly your dream

LAUREN
Exactly But I kinda like it And
what I’m saying iswhere we are
now

KATIE

and eating cream puffs

JESSE
It’s so good to see all these
friendly Amherst Lit faces I can’t
wait to tell them I’m working on my
novel Has anyone seen that guy
Gary He’s got to be gay by now

KATIE
I think your brilliant story about
a young man in clown college who
truly finds himself after having a
homo-erotic relationship with an
acrobat will be misunderstood by
this crowd

JESSE
Youre right It’s too layered

Lauren looks distracted She waves to AUDREYa late-20’s
fellow Amherst grad from across the room Audrey comes over

LAUREN
Shit She’s coming over She
probably thinks I work at Penguin
by now and can help her network

KATIE
Well she’s in for a real fucking
surprise am I right

Katie does a motion where she mimes talking on the phone
while sucking a penis Lauren laughs and relaxes

LAUREN
Yeah you’re right I’m very
successful I’m going to be honest
and justrock her world

JESSE
This oughtta be good

Audrey squeals and throws her arms around Lauren

AUDREY
Lauren Powell I haven’t seen you

hands a little too intimately

LAUREN
What are you up to these days

AUDREY

last week with Augusten Burrows

Audrey continues to hold Lauren’s hands in hers while she
talks now waving both their arms up and down

LAUREN
I’ve actually left publishing for

Oh I see That’s sad

Audreys judgement makes Lauren lose a little confidence

KATIE
Audrey is it I’m Katie Steele Do

Lauren takes a deep breath setting the cake on the table
Adele peeks at it-- the cake has two phones humping one

This must be so overwhelming

Lauren nods and gulps from her champagne glass

SCOTT
Wait I’d like to make a toast To
my wonderful daughter who five
years after Amherst has finally
blossomed into the young woman she
always wanted to be

Adele raises her glass to Lauren Katie taps their glasses a

We were just talking about Katie’s
career path actually She’s
thinking of changing careers

ADELE
That’s wonderful Lauren gives
great advice What are you
considering

LAUREN
Actually it’s complicated--

KATIE

I thought you’d never ask Ive
actually been doing something with
Lauren this summer that I just love
and has made us both so happy

(to Lauren)
It was “the best summer of your
life” was it not

Lauren tries to talk but Katie stops her

KATIE (CONTD)
Oh I’1l tell them I tell it
better

Lauren’s eyes go wide pleading for mercy Katie just steam
rolls ahead Lauren tries to stop her but can’t

KATIE (CONTD)
She’s so modest What a head for
business on this one You see I
used to work for this crappy phone
sex line Don’t worry I was a
virgin not some sexual deviant--
But it entailed pretty flaccid
profits if you know what I mean
Then Lauren helped me launch my
very own phone sex hotline Well
it’s ours now isn’t it Business
is booming Our very first TV
commercial airs tonight on Channel
47 It’s tasteful I promise And
things really couldn’t be better

SCOTT
Are you serious

ADELE
Lauren

Lauren breaths heavy She’s panicked

LAUREN
I can explain
(to Katie)
First I think you should go

KATIE
(sweetly)
But I’m not finished with my cordon
bleu Best Friend

LAUREN
(pissed)
I should have never moved in with
you You irrational lunatic You’ve
ruined everything

Katie stands up angrily While taking her purse off its hook
on the table she snags the table cloth and some of the
glasses spill It’s a whole scene

KATIE
I’m a lunatic Great It’s been a
pleasure Thanks for lunch
(to Lauren)
THIS IS WHY I’M NOT FRIENDS WITH

Katie storms off and leaves Lauren alone with her parents

EXT SARABETH’S RESTAURANT- CONTINUOS

Katie walks past the front of the restaurant Lauren can’t
see her but Katie looks longingly at her Lauren’s head is
hung and her hands are over her face Katie wipes away a
quick tear and resumes her angry strut down the street

INT SARABETH’S RESTAURANT- CONTINUOS
Lauren pulls her hands from her face and takes a deep breath

LAUREN
You know what guys I’mnot
apologizing for this Not this one
I haven’t made a wrong move since I
stopped sleeping in a crib

Scott opens his mouth as if to speak

LAUREN (CONTD)
(putting her hand up)

Hear me out I’ve done everything
exactly right not just for you
but for me I thought that was who
I was Butthis is who I am I
did just have the best summer of my
life It was fun My ideas made
this business better and that means
more to me than all the A’s I got
in school When I worked for Morty
I was bored Mom

(MORE )

LAUREN (CONTD)

I kept thinking it would get more
fun or more challenging if it were
Random House but the truth is I
don’t want to sit next to a stack
of bad manuscripts all day If I’ve
learned anything from all this
it’s that I have no idea what the
hell I want But for right now I
want to run a phonesex line with my
best friend Who I think is really
hurt right now because I snuck to a
job interview behind her back and
lied to her And don’t say anything
mean about Katie Dad She’s so
earnest and funny and alive and--

ADELE
I thought she was fun

SCOTT
(scratches his chin)
This is just a shock Lauren I’m
not sure what to say You don’t
want the job at Random House if
they offer it to you

LAUREN

They offered it to me this morning
I turned them down I wanted to
tell you not like this but
This is the right thing for now

I’m happy

ADELE
That’s all we care about right
Scott

(Scott kinda nods)
So you’re more of a business
manager you’re not actually a
phone sex operator are you

The CREEPY WAITER drops the check on the table He nods
knowingly at Lauren who blushes her answer

INT KATIE AND LAUREN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

KATIE

Oh I’m going to flip out Why

LAUREN
Oh man Ok I just felt like I had
to go to the interview it was
Random House It’s been my dream to
work there but then--

KATIE
But then what You decided you
could sow your royal oats with me
for a summer and then go back to
your perfect little life when the
opportunity knocked

LAUREN
No Come on you’re acting crazy

KATIE

with you You with your perfect
little sheets and your pink
toothbrush and your sitcom parents
on the phone at the same time

LAUREN

KATIE

KATIE

Lauren tries to hold it in but it rises to the surface

LAUREN
Fine Your whole life’s a mess
Always has been You’re such a
fake You lie about your fake job
You lied about your experience
Always pushing your sex and your
confidence - what a lie You’re
messy you’re dirty and you’re a
lost soul who has lost her mind
That is if you ever had one

KATIE

I’ve lost my mind Please Youre
the one who lives in candy land
where everything is perfect Look
at you up there on your pedestal
looking down on me You’ve always
thought you were better than me and
everyone You think you can teach
me about sex Without me youd be
stuck in the missionary position
forever

LAUREN
Well at least I don’t do everything
in my power to be different

KATIE
Well at least I don’t do everything
in my power to be boring and the
same as everyone

LAUREN
You wish you were a whore

KATIE
You’re such a judgemental bitch

They are both seething mad

LAUREN
You know what I don’t have to take
this You’re insane Just take your
stripper pole and shove that inside
you

Katie is shocked by that one She walks over to the stripper
pole and dislodges it She starts swinging it around and
walking toward Lauren like a mad woman

KATIE
Oh you mean this stripper pole

She swings it toward Lauren’s head Lauren screams and grabs
a large dildo that happens to be on the coffee table on a
stack of napkins like a paper weight She swings it at Katie

KATIE (CONTD)

WHOOSH The pole whizzes by Lauren’s head

LAUREN

KATIE

that thing Liar

LAUREN

stupid enough to run up her cell
phone bill for 2 a minute

Katie stops in her tracks Lauren stops too- mid-dildo swing

KATIE
You know since you think I’m so
stupid I don’t even know why

Lauren looks at Katie They’re both hurt but with all that’s
been said it’s too late now

LAUREN

thought I was better than you But

thing I am

Lauren sets the dildo down and marches to the door She opens
it and stands in the doorway
