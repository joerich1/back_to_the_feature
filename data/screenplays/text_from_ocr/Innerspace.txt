First Draft

A STRANGE LANDSCAPE

Like the surface of some alien planet CELESTIAL FORMS spin
in the distance DROP DOWN over a topography of rolling hills

ALVIN 5 - THE POD

A titanium alloy sphere the strongest form to withstand
great pressures A streamlined mantle houses propellers
batteries articulated arms - one containing a carbon-dioxide
laser Maneuvering thrusters protrude next to antennae

WEIRD SUBMARINE FORMS

glow in artificial light We float over undulating undersea
hills Tendrils of beautiful growths wave in the currents

AL (VO)
one small schlep for mankind

INT - ALVIN 5

THE MAN INSIDE is Al Viola 35 ex-Marine ex-astronaut
He holds a doctorate in Medieval Languages from the Sorbonne
He is worldly highly trained Right now hes elated as well

AL
but it means money in
the bank to me

A VOICE cuts in - The Mission Control Officer - COLIN

COLIN - VO
Could you to stop counting
your profits long enough for
a systems check

AL
This is a small breakthrough

Ive a right to make a statement

A LAB SOMEWHERE

Technicians cluster around VIDEO SCREENS showing
feeds from LVINS MULTIPLE CAMERAS One shot from the housing
faces forward Another is of Al at the controls Exotic equipment
surrounds him A CLOCK is prominent It reads ELAPSED
MISSION TIME - 1 hour 14 minutes A third camera fixed to
a long extension arm articulates 360 and shoots back to
show the POD

COLIN
What a pain in theWhere did we
get this prima donna (into mike)

Then do try to keep it dignified
Puns are a sign of oxygen
deprivation of the brain Now give
us bank three if you would

AL
Alright alright Air filtration
88 battery load 76

Reception is perfect Al reports full success He reads off
instrument readings rapidly His voice is clipped

and precisea test pilot Behind him packed into every corner
of the tiny cockpit are computers and scientific instruments

THE LAB TECHNICIANS are taut organized and highly
disciplined There is a sense of purpose of very important business

THE SUBMERSIBLE swoops through valleys lined with
stranger growths The craft is perfectly balanced responsive
to the pilots lightest touch

END TITLES
SILICON VALLEY - DAWN

A peaceful setting flowers on low rolling hills a high-tech
building complex - UNITED SYNERGISTIC TECHNOLOGIES

TWO MEN ON A HILL OVERLOOKING UST

They are fooling with something It goes off A rocket flares out in the
direction of the building The rocketeer guides the flight of
the Remotely Piloted Vehicle on a video monitor

ABOVE THE BUILDING retro jets slow the craft A small braking
chute blooms It settles braking jets fire briefly as it lands
softly on the rooftop air duct

THE ROCKETEER hits a button blue flame shoots out
the underside of the vehicle It burns a tiny pinpoint through
the duct

INT UNITED SYNERGISTIC TECHNOLOGIES - A HIGH-TECH LAB

THE SAME ONE SAME TIME - A TECH turns from the video
monitors and looks through a window into the main experimental
areaA maze of equipment Some bizarre tension-filled procedure
is going on Techs in the control room smoke like fiends Others
in the clean-room are enclosed head to foot in sterile coveralls

Air temp just went up

ENG 2
Were drawing lots of power
INT UST FRONT OFFICE
Salesmen job seekers crowd the busy

lobby One applicant Joe Doakes 30 has a air of
desperation His tie is too tight His hair wont behave

Hes

nicked himself shaving The surveillance cameras make him nervous

He checks his watch impatiently rises and crosses to the

Remember me

She barely looks upa 40 watt smile

Im sorry Were running behind
So many applicantsso few jobs
If youll just have a seat

The landing craft withdraws its torch

deploys a nozzle-arm PSSSSCCCHHHT A colorless gas is emitted

- A hallucinogen debilitating but not fatalnot even

unpleasant t makes people highly suggestible pliable complacent

INT LAB AND CONTROL ROOM-

Slowly almost imperceptibly
the hubbub and chatter die off People stand and sit
as before but slowly slow downCigarettes slow halfway to the
mouthCoffee cups stop in mid-sip In the lab procedures justslow
A man at a control board looks down as if suddenly its
all Greekthe lights and buttons suddenly foreign to him Others
seem bemused daydreamingThey smile at each other and
try to think of something to say Some of them giggle

EXT THE VALLEY

A CHOPPER glides through the pass

and settles on the UST landing pad Five figures exit the chopper
all dressed alike dark coveralls and boots motorcycle

helmets with reflectored visorsA PRECISION ATTACK

THE INTRUDERS - walk to the access door They are

armed disciplined well drilled Movement is unhurried

but efficient They carry submachine guns A GUARD eyes them placidly
Their LEADER speaks through a radio directly into the UST

intercom He is assured and calm The GUARD is bemused drugged
LEADER

Hello
GUARD

Hello
LEADER

Wed like to come in

The guard is lethargic The gas has sapped his will

One part of his brain cannot accept what he is about to do He
giggles softly at the thought of it even as he is compelled to
obey

GUARD
(giggling)
Youd liketo come in

LEADER
Open the door please

GUARD
(still giggling)
Open the door Certainly

The door pops open They enter and pass the bemused
guard

LEADER
Thank you

GUARD
My pleasure

INT LAB AREA

Everyone is smilingstoned The

LEADER speaks to them like children not to be funny but because
low-key orders are the most efficient They are completely
suggestible

LEADER
Hello

TECH
Hello

LEADER

Weve come for the PEM114
Where is it

TECH 2
Right there

LEADER
Thank you

The INTRUDERS step up to the lab equipment Another
techsteps forwardHe is struggling against the effects of
the drug

TECH 3
Wait

LEADER
Why

TECH 3

You cant take that

LEADER
Why not

TECH 3
The experiment The danger

THE VOICE is soothing calming hypnotic but the
submachine guns are always in position

LEADER
Its alright

TECH 3
It is

LEADER
It will be fine

TECH 3
Just one The back up

LEADER
Could I have it please

TECH 3

I cant get it out It would take

LEADER
Thats alright

TECH 3
Tear it apart

LEADER
Yes

TECH 3

AhhhOkay

You have another

hours

Just tear it apart

He tears into a complex web of electronic circuitry

ripping wires and circuit boards apart With a POP

go out

The lights dip

the circuits

the OVERHEAD VIDEO SCREENS go out

as the TECH comes up with the MAIN CIRCUIT BOARD

THE SHRIEK of an ALARM SIREN
open
Doakes Joe stands in shock
door shut behind him
stares at him
at them Dustin Hoffman on drugs
hes no threat

LEADER
What do you want

JOE

Drink of water

A beat then the LEADER relaxes

LEADER
Go get a drink

This has the force of suggestion
walks through and out of the room

relaxes his grip on the gun

Suddenly a door swings

The LEADERS gun swings on the figure in the doorwayJoe
looks at the gun
The ALARM CUTS OUT Everyone in the room
he stands there rumpled and bemused blinking

swings the

the LEADER sees
The LEADER snaps out

Finally

(stoned innocent)

He waves Joe away

Joe turns and
-looking for a drink The LEADER

motions to INTRUDER 2 to continue

INTRUDER 2

TECH 2
Yes thats it

LEADER
Give it to me

He does Another tech offers the Leader the spare
He holds the tiny circuit board in his palm removes one chip

LEADER
This the only spare

TECH 2
Yes

LEADER
The other working

TECH 2
Perfectly

The Leader has something in his hand a CLICK a

WHOOSH A butane lighter melts the circuit board to microscopic
slag The Tech looks at his scorched hand the destroyed
silicon bead is voice is still slightly amused

TECH 2
Ow

LEADER
Itl be alright

TECH 2
It will

LEADER
It doesnt hurt

TECH 2

No

The Leader pauses for a moment amused by their sheep-like
acquiescence His next suggestion is droll

LEADER
It tickles

The tech looks at his smoking hand in dismaythen

incredibly finds something amusing in his second degree burn

He starts to laughit ticklesThe other techs look confused
then its contagious They start to laugh too

INTRUDER 5 steps into the room full of laughing
idiots He moves to the LEADER They speak quickly and both

leave

INT HIGH TECH EXPERIMENT AREA
The LEADER is surprised

LEADER
Whats this

INT 5
Theyre further along
than we thought

CU - an empty beaker on a pad surrounded by exotic
equipment

INT 5
-Looks almost ready to go

A WALKIE-TALKIE SQUAWKS

WT (VO)
response to door alarm

LEADER
Time to go (looks at the
beaker) It doesnt matter
We have the PEM

They turn and exit the room As they do the LEADER

notices Joe aimlessly examining the wall of equipment nearby

Joe is really stonedHes fooling with a control panel flicking
switches on and off He notices the INTRUDERS Caught he tries

to make the best of it He smooths his hair spins and comes

to a half-assed kind of attention As he turns he knocks some wildly
expensive piece of equipment to the floor Joe grimaces and
straightens his tie making it much worse The LEADER comes close
to him stares at him thoughtfully Joe blinks back trying to
clear his head in case speaking is requiredThe leader looks at
the smashed equipment Joe looks at it guiltily The Radio SQUAWKS

The Leader decides Abruptly he kicks the equipment

out of his way It smashes against the back wall Joe wincesthe
Leader turns and stalks out of the room Joe holds his attention
position for a moment like a good scout then seems

to find himself lost and alone in a room full of strange
equipment

MAIN ROOM

OTHER INTRUDERS finish taking apart the equipment
The LEADER addresses the crowd a James Mason-ish
air about him

LEADER
We must be off Goodbye

TECHS
GoodbyeGoodbye

They all wish them goodbyesmiles and laughter
all around The one who struggled steps forward
He struggles again

TECH 3
Whoareyou

INTRUDER 5 just laughs but the LEADER turns back to TECH 3

LEADER
Im your mother

CLOSE UP - TECH 3

Stunned and confusedHe shakes his head and blinks rapidly
He rubs his eyes

TECH 3S POV

Before his eyes the IMAGE OF THE LEADER shrinks down
and transforms itself into that of a grey haired old lady

TECH 3 - cant believe it

TECH 3
Momwhat are you doing here

LEADER
Leaving now go to sleep
»-all of you

Some of them do The INTRUDERS step back through

the door The TECHS look at each other blankly Then they look

at the ceiling the wallstheir shoes anything In the video
monitoring section others watch the INTRUDERS leave on SCREENSTheir
faces register nothing The LEADER pausesA final

command

LEADER
Give me the surveillance
camera videotapes

The video tech does

INT LAB - HOURS LATER

He indicates glass wall through which they can see the
bystanders including Joe being questioned one at a time
Joe looks a little queasy He burpsan uneasy stomach

COLIN
Well have to let them go

FINNEGAN
Surveilliance on them all

COLIN looks uncomfortable at the thought Tech 2 steps through a
door and catches his eye He excuses himself as the FINNEGAN
turns back to study his suspects in the window

INT LAB - TECH 2 is panicked He speaks quietly intensely
TECH 2
The PEM Its gone
They must have it

COLIN
How did they know No one knew

TECH 2
Whoever has it can leapfrog
generations of technology
We gotta get it back

TECH 3
Screw the PEMWhat about Al

TECH 2
Poor bastard

AL - IN THE POD

fighting for his life The pod is slammed and buffeted Al
struggles with the controls as the POD tumbles

AL
Come in controlDo you read me
Come indamn

He flips frantically through the controls

AL
This wasnt in the plan

Then it dawns on him he may be in big trouble

THE POD - A different LANDTurbulent convulsive alive THE

POD seems to drop through an enormous tunnellike a marble ina
sewer It churns in a mass of liquid Semi-solid forms SLAM
against the housing and rush on They are enormous forms
balls discs rodschainsThey swirl in the ebb then drop
away before usWE TUMBLE GLANCE OFF A WALL SPIN TO SEE A NEW
WAVE DESCEND UPON US AND Al sets his thrusters at full
forward for maximum manoueverability in the flow and powers
through the vortexesHis voice is tight with effort concern

AL
Where in theYEAOOOW

THE BOTTOM DROPS AWAY An abyss opens up before him

THE POD - plunges through the hole and FALLSFALLSFALLS
INTO a smoking churning cavern It hits the surface of something
plunges through into the darker depthsof a ROARING GROANING
BUBBLING INFERNO

INSIDE - AL has browned out from the impact He now comes
arounddazed He is once more in darknessThe dark masses
block his floodlights throwing weird shadowsHe switches over
to infrared imaging

Infrared imaging displays THE ENVIRNMENT on his cockpit glass in
a HEADS-UP-DISPLAY

Alright guys the jokes
gone far enough

A WIRE-FRAME REPRESENTATION OF THE BODY

guides Al as he powers the POD ahead The capillary branches
into larger and larger vesselsThe pressure and speed builds
with every branchAl has to fly like crazy to avoid collision
with solid particles On the monitors he watchs the sonar
computer imaging to guide his navigation

EXT POD

He enters a main artery The walls bulge with each

pump of the heartthen up ahead the heart he tries to back
down reverse his thrust but its no good He is being sucked in
Nowhere to turnno way to escapeHe decides and THRUSTS FULL
FORWARD into the heart

WHOOSH He is pulled into a VENTRICAL spunTHE WORLD BLURRS
as he is expelled in a surge of blood and pushed up the artery
Spinning wildly he fights for control swings into a vein

THE TUNNEL gets smaller He checks his navigation aidsIt
branchesAl cuts into the --- artery and up the neck into the
base of the headbefore hima barriera membrane appears
INSIDE - INT THE POD

AL pulls up in an eddy and aims the laser at the membrane
It slices a neat hole through it The FLOW bursts through
the breach and carries the POD with it

OTHER SIDE OF THE MEMBRANE - Al swings the pod aroundHe is in
anotherregionwhere the water is still He swings the laser
around again and spot welds the tear in the membranebefore he
can complete the joba treelike thing is swept into the hole by
the flood Other debris collect behind it until the hole is
sealed shutSlowly the current dies

Al has just slipped through the BLOODBRAIN barrier and has taken up
residence in the left VENTRICLE - A FLUID FILLED CAVITY in the brain

INSIDE - INT THE POD

It pulls into the bloodstream

Is whisked at HIGH SPEED through the arteries
The trip is not farHe pulls into an area

of great activity A BATTLEFIELD

THE WOUND - White blood cells and antibodies rush past Invading
viral agents are hunted down and destroyed

MICROSCOPIC BITS OF MATTER - dirt carried into the wound - now
relatively ENORMOUS - Loom over him as he powers through a
FANTASTIC INNERSPACE of organic and inorganic matter

MASSIVE MOUNTAINOUS BOULDER - scene of a RAGING BATTLE between
invading viruses and antibodies It writhes with the ebb and flow
of the battle as Al comes in closer

INSIDE - INT THE POD

AL takes videos of the virus He records

the structure of the rock He hits the rock with his laser and

does a spectrum analysis He analyses on the computers

Antibodies are trapping the last of the
viruses as they try to make a getawaySuddenly one of the
Antibodies slowsturnsswings back at the POD
INT AL
He drops everything and turns to escape

INSIDE - EXT THE POD

Al tries to outrundodging getting
other particles between himself and his huntersBut its no
good Theres no escape Other killers bunch to cut the POD off
Al swirls away swings round a bit of matter There it is

GIANT ANTIBODY - COMING RIGHT FOR HIM A rushing soundlike
being run down by the Queen Mary This is it

He closes his eyes and braces Nothing happens He looks

It has rushed past Ignoring him it hits a mass of toxins and
shatters them It breaks apart small components attach to the
germs and kill them

AL
Under the threshold Im too
small to do damageto the body
or theyll get to me later

He looks up looming over him like a vast tentis SOMETHING
NEAR THE SKIN SURFACE

Diffused light sparkles off of blue veins and red capillaries

A sparkling field of motion

The THING is a deep GREEN with purple highlightsIt once was alive
and maybe still isTendrils of waving streamers trail out
behind itAs antibodies attach to itSlowly it changes dies
becomes absorbed It seems familiar to him
