EXT ARCTIC OCEAN - DAY

Stars in the black of space PAN DOWN to sapphire blue sky the
brighter stars still shining through Its Arctic midnight the
weak sun tiny on the distant horizon We SKIM along the water
in and around looming glacial cliffs--

The top of an iceberg pushes through the waters surface
Carved into the ice is a single mammoth word

GODZILLA

We continue past along the ocean and discover
An old fishing boat the RAINBOW WARRIOR holds position
outside a small natural harbor All lights extinguished

INT LLEWELLYN HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The window is wide open The curtains dont move A fan labors
pointlessly aimed toward the bed--which is empty Suddenly
the mattress JUMPS bumped from beneath There is a giggle

KEITH (0S)
I thought we got on the floor to
cool off

JILL (0OS)
Oh gee Im sorry Ill stop

KEITH (0S)
Just an observation No
complaint Please continue
The phone RINGS shrilly

KEITH (0S)

KEITH LLEWELLYN pulls himself out from under the bed to answer

the phone He is mid-thirties with a charming smile

KEITH

JILL LLEWELLYN has emerged from beneath the bed A woman of
high intelligence and strong passions Keith extends the phone

KEITH

Dr Llewellyn How soon Yes I

She hangs up the phone Looks at Keith dismayed

JILL

KEITH
I hate cold weather

Jill pulls him to her Smiles at him
JILL
Could be our last chance to be

warm for a while

He smiles back at her leans in to kiss her--

A
EXT LLEWELLYN HOME - NIGHT

At an upstairs window TINA LLEWELLYN looks out 15 years old
bright and aching to test boundaries She peers at the
helicopter

A CUTE PILOT guides the copter to the ground

Across the street a NEIGHBOR and his SON emerge from their
house to investigate the noise Prop wash blows loose a pink
plastic lawn flamingo The Neighbor grabs for it

The rotors wind down The Cute Pilot goes over a checklist He
looks up--and his eyes go wide

CUTE PILOT
Oh man

Tina is coming toward the copter wearing T-shirt tights and
an underage smile

CUTE PILOT
(extends his wrists to
co-pilot)
Just slap the cuffs on me now and
be done with it

Tina reaches the cockpit The Cute Pilot looks down at his
clipboard very aware that looking anywhere else could result in
a morals charge

TINA

CUTE PILOT
Good evening miss Kinda late
for you to be up isnt it

TINA
Im old enough

Across the street the neighbor clutches his flamingo

NEIGHBOR
I dont care how high-up they
areEver since they moved in

its one disruption after another

SON
(staring at Tina)
I dont mind

Jill and Keith exit the house carrying parkas and small
duffels Jill sees Tina--and hurries to her The Cute Pilot
still studies his clipboard

JILL
Tinathis is hardly an
appropriate fashion statement

Keith drapes his parka around Tinas shoulders

TINA
That depends on what Im trying to
say

The Cute Pilot chuckles--and then meets Keiths glare
Refocuses on his clipboard Jill herds Tina toward the house
into the shelter of the porch and the doorway Keith follows

TINA
God unruffle mom Its no big
deal--

JILL

I dont want any problems while
were gone Itll only be a few
days tops

TINA
I could go stay with Aunt Julia

KEITH
Aunt Julias rarely home long We
dont want you to be by yourself--

Tina lets out a loud snort of a laugh

KEITH
--in New York In Manhattan
Here youre safe
(spreads his arms a
knowing understatement)
Nothing unusual ever happens here

She smiles at the sight of him the helicopter behind him on the
lawn gearing up to take off

KEITH
Really--youll be okay
TINA
Tll be fine dad Go on

KEITH
Okay Wellbye

He kisses her forehead Takes his parka heads out toward the
helicopter Pauses to call to the Neighbor

KEITH
Will you keep an eye on things for
us Mr Torkleson

The Neighbors son answers immediately almost gratefully

SON
Yes

NEIGHBOR
(scowls at his son)
Yesno problem

Jill regards Tina who looks away sullenly Jill smiles
ruefully

JILL
Use some of the money in the bread
box to buy a bathrobe huh

TINA
Whatever mom

Jill looks at her A perfunctory kiss--neither is comfortable
with it--and then Jill heads for the helicopter

The helicopter lifts Jill sees Tina standing in the shadows of
the porch She looks very small and alone

EXT ARCTIC OUTPOST - DAY

An C-130 transport with ski treads lands on a makeshift
airstrip Temporary shelters have been set up The Rainbow
Warrior is now mostly submerged

Jill and Keith emerge from the plane make final adjustments to
their biohazard suits heavy-duty coveralls with full hood and

visor hood slung back Keith has a thin file folder

A young captain TUCKER peachfuzz mustache failing to make him
look older meets them He also wears a biohazard suit

TUCKER
(greets each)
Dr Llewellyn Dr Llewellyn
Im Tucker

Tucker takes Keiths arm snaps something onto the sleeve

TUCKER
Radiation badge If it goes red
consider yourself cured of cancer

KEITH
And dead of course

JILL
(as Tucker snaps a badge
on her)
But a healthy kind of dead

KEITH
(points with the file)
What the hell have you found here
anyway

Tucker leads them toward the fissure Ahead
wheel large storage drums out of the fissure
seats a lid Jill stops him peers inside

JILL
This is peculiar soup

TUCKER
Early analysis is pretty weird
It has a marked resemblance to
amniotic fluid We think

JILL
Amniotic fluid

KEITH
Like in a womb

TUCKER
Uh-huhwell not really
therere some complex compounds
and a heavy barbiturate presence
We think

bio-suited workers
One worker re-
Jill scowls her mind suddenly very far away as she contemplates
this information

TUCKER
I know one of you Doctors
Llewellyn is a bio-chemist

Despite being addressed Jill does not answer Keith steps in

KEITH
That would be the pretty one

TUCKER
We have a lab set up if youd like
to

But Jill is already moving off with the worker wheeling the
barrel

KEITH
I think shed like to Hey Jill

She turns He hands her the file Leans to kiss her cheek but
shes already reading the folder as she walks away

Keith glances at Tucker shrugs Tucker smiles Pulls on his
hood seals it Keith does too Tucker gestures to follow
slips into the fissure--

INT WOMB CAVERN - DAY

Keith and Tucker clamber down ladders anchored to the glacier
deep into the fissure into

A huge cavern carved out of ice and earth lit by a string of
bare lights that stretch away in both directions

The wall opposite the fissure is imposing and strange made up
of crevices and finely textured stone markedly different from
the ice wall and ceiling

A bio-suited workcrew pumps the red-black fluid into storage
drums Tucker leads Keith slogging through shin-deep fluid

TUCKER
The entire cavern was filled with
this stuff--

Suddenly there is a LOW RUMBLE--a small TREMOR Ice sifts down
from above Lights flicker Keith glances at Tucker

TUCKER
An avalanche somewhere Or the
sea floor shifting The blast
that opened this up was some
pretty mean shake-and-bake

Something beyond Tucker has drawn Keiths attention apparently
it is a smaller cavern Inside are weirdly regular rows of
stalagmite and stalactites Keith moves inside examining them
Tucker stands outside

KEITH
This is the strangest stalactite
formation Ive ever seen

TUCKER
Those arent stalactites

Keith gives him a puzzled look starts to really examine the
cavern--

TUCKER
(enjoys the revelation)
Theyre teeth

Keiths eyes widen--he suddenly sees whats been in front of him
all along hes inside a giant mouth He scrambles out to
beside Tucker

KEITH
My Godmy God

He takes in the mouth Touches the strangely-textured wall

KEITH
And this isnt stoneis it
Its petrified or something--but
this is skin
(he turns to Tucker)
Its skin

TUCKER
Its skin We think But it
might as well be stone for all
the good weve done trying to get
a tissue samplewe broke three
diamond drill bits on it--

Keith clambers up over the open mouth caught up in the moment

KEITH
This is incrediblethe
preservation is extraordinary
Mammoths and the like found frozen
show much more decay Even the

Alps ice man--

He stops Stares down the length of the body
The string of lights is more than a football field in length

And then the earth shakes again as the beasts head moves--—
Claws tear out of the earth--

One whole section of wall undulates--and we become aware that
the monsters tail is wrapped around the entire cavern--

Sections of the ladder tear loose Climbers plunge to earth--
The mouth closes then opens again FIRE fills the cavern--

And there is a DISTINCTIVE ROAR sharp and terrifying unlike
anything anyone has ever heard--

INT ARCTIC OUTPOST - DAY

Jill peers into a microscope--and suddenly the building shakes
She braces for it to pass It doesnt It gets worse

The door slams open A Radio Man scrambles to a radio near
Jill Fluorescent lights flicker strobing the room

JILL
Whats going on--

The whole room tips upending cabinets and shelves Jill is
pinned beneath a table

RADIO MAN
Mayday Mayday This is Arctic
Outpost--

A beam collapses slamming into him silencing him The room is
still shaking Jill tries to push the cabinet off of her but
it is too heavy She looks toward the window and GASPS--

Despite her obscured view of the window in the half-collapsed
wall she sees

The two rows of huge gleaming jagged teeth moving past and
past and past for much longer than one would expect

JILL
My god

And then the building is jarred again and the ceiling
COLLAPSES and the flickering lights flicker off

EXT TAKI ISLANDS - NIGHT

FADE UP TITLE
TAKI ISLANDS NORTHEAST OF JAPAN

Heavy winds and rain a HURRICANE A small fishing village
battens down for the storm Waves lash across the docks

One villager JUNJI looks out from his house Moored boats
bang against the docks Villagers hurry to cover past the fish
stacked on the wharf

One boats lines have come loose it is in danger of getting
swamped JUNJI gasps it is his boat

JUNJIS WIFE appears in the doorway behind him drawn by his
gasp She sees the boat Junji starts to leave the house--

His wife stops him with a hand on his shoulder

JUNJIS WIFE
(in Japanese)
Dont go out there--youll drown

JUNJI
(in Japanese)
Without my boat I have no life

He stares at her adamant She nods resigned--but gestures for
him to wait Disappears into the house Reappears with a
bright yellow slicker She helps Junji into it He gives her

a kiss then ducks into the storm She watches him go

LIGHTNING scrabbles across the dark heavy clouds Junji hurries

to his boat Struggles to make the line fast

From out in the ocean the village looks very small very
fragile And then something rises out of the waves blocking
the village Huge with jagged dorsal fins Godzilla

On the docks a SOUND rises above the storm the DISTINCTIVE
ROAR Junji looks up--

There is a FLASH OF LIGHTNING Between Junji and the lightning
the huge shape continues to rise--

Junji stares up in horror and shock One huge taloned foot
crashes down nearly on the small dock And then the monster
takes another step--

A dark shadow falls across Junji--

His wife watches frozen with terror--

Junji falls back against the piling The huge foot looms
directly over him He can see up up up the height of the
body the two arms the serpentine neck

JUNJI
(in Japanese)
It cannot be
(a certainty)
Gojira

The foot descends--past him miraculously sparing him

Other villagers see whats coming Some run some freeze some
pray Some race for the refuge of trees behind the village
The beast looms One four-clawed hand reaches down--

--toward the villagers Toward Junji

--Godzilla scoops up the entirety of the days catch and

tosses it into his gaping mouth past enormous sharp teeth

His head turns toward the village He moves the earth shaking
beneath his tread Junjis wife stares up as he nears--

Junji screams from the docks--
JUNJI
(in Japanese)

Run Run

--but she cant hear Godzillas foot comes down--
--crushing the house

Junjits eyes go hollow He stares now a mad witness
Godzillas tail drags across the village causing more
destruction More villagers are buried beneath the wreckage
But Godzilla pays them no heed

He reaches for the windswept forest behind the village scoops a
huge furrow in the ground uprooting an entire copse of trees
He raises it to his mouth--and two villagers who were hiding
shake loose plummet to the ground Godzilla gulps down the
trees

He moves back toward the ocean--then pauses Cranes his head
back looking up into the sky searching for something--

The clouds blow apart briefly revealing the night sky empty
save for twinkling stars The clouds close Lightning crackles--

GODZILLA ROARS and BREATHES FIRE A warning A challenge
And then he goes to all fours and dives into the sea his huge
bulk moving past Junji impossibly fast Godzillas 150-foot

tail sweeps around creating a huge wave--

The wave CRASHES across the island hurling ships over docks and
smashing through houses--—

Junji clings to a piling for his life The water sweeps by--
somehow Junji holds on He stares out at the sea--

Where the monster sinks down disappearing into the violent
storm-tossed ocean

AARON VAUGHT Tall graceful eyes watchful behind wire-rimmed

glasses He looks like a ski instructor who chucked it all to
become a librarian

MARTY KENOSHITA enthusiastic bordering on intense He lugs a
large trial case

Aaron steps up on the hood of the car then to the roof giving
him a view across the top of the wall--

Beyond the barbed wire is not the expected prison Instead
there are manicured tea gardens small cottages A koi pond
beneath lovely waterfalls All that betrays the illusion of a
luxury hotel is the wall surrounding the grounds on three
sides The bluff is the fourth barrier

Marty scrambles up next to Aaron
MARTY
There he is
(points)
Staring at the ocean

Across the grounds a figure sits

AARON
Maybe he is crazy like they say

MARTY
Yeah and maybe not If you
wanted to hide someone keep them
quiet this would be a good place--
AARON
Marty no paranoia tonight

swings over A beat Marty heaves his case over follows

EXT MORI OGAI CARE INSTITUTE - GROUNDS - EVENING
Marty and Aaron near the seated figure--

It is Junji--looking much older than can be accounted for by the

time passed He seems unaware of their presence eyes staring
out to sea

AARON

No response Aaron nods to Marty Marty translates what Aaron
says into Japanese nearly simultaneously

AARON
Youre a hard man to find Junji
Weve been talking to survivors of
the Taki Island Deluge for almost
a year

Still no response Marty adds something more in Japanese With
his eyes Aaron inquires what

MARTY
I said they all tell the same
story the worst hurricane in
fifty years virtually washed away
one of the chain

Aaron nods steps closer to Junji Marty still translates

AARON
But there are also stories of a
man who saw a giant dragon A
dragon that breathed fire and made
tidal waves

He waits Nothing He sighs--
--and then Junji speaks Marty translates to English

JUNJIMARTY
A storm killed my wife And I am
a crazy man that no one believes

AARON

(Marty translating)
Every culture has myths about
dragons The Midgard Serpent
Quetzacoatl The dragon that
sleeps at the heart of the
world

(beat)
Only I dont think theyre just
stories

MARTY
(in Japanese)
He even wrote a book about it

Before Aaron can stop him Marty pulls out an oversized
paperback hands it to Junji

Aarons photo is on the back cover Junji looks from it to
Aaron Aaron a little sheepish strikes the same pose smiles
the same smile Junji turns the book over His eyes widen--

THE WAKING DRAGON by Aaron Vaught The cover is an old wood
print of a dragon it vaguely resembles Godzilla Junji
hurriedly opens the book to a photo an Aztec hieroglyph of
Quetzacoatl again Godzilla-like

Junji flips through the book becoming more excited with each
photograph each reproduced drawing He pauses--

CLOSE ON an Assyrian carving of a dragon and a gryphon wrapped
around each other locked in combat

AARON
(Marty translating)

I believe in dragons Junji
Junji looks up at him--then stands suddenly and hurries off
carrying Aarons book Aaron and Marty follow

they knew--

He reaches into a space beneath the floor digs out sheaves of
paper They spill toward Aaron a flood of paper--

--drawings of Godzilla Hundreds Aaron and Marty sift through
them moving carefully to not step on them Junji speaks
excitedly Marty listens translate for Aaron

MARTY
He says he dreams of it
Remembers stories from his
grandfather About the people

Junji holds up a drawing Painted on it are the three Japanese
Katakana characters for Godzilla

JUNJI

Marty whips out a PDA writes down the name

AARON
Have we ever indexed that name

MARTY
No--wait yesIn 1928 Atkinson

He cuts himself off A particular drawing has caught his eye
He kneels beside it staring Aaron joins him

It is a painting A gryphon curled into a fetal position in
a mound beneath the earth Godzilla breathing fire on it

Aaron nods picks it up--
Suddenly two uniformed POLICEMAN burst into the cottage They
move toward Aaron and Marty who back away Aaron folds the

paper slips it into his pocket

Junji panicked crawls picking up his drawings holding them
to his chest

The glass building sits inside a larger structure which contains
a huge WATER-FILLED TANK stretching off into the distance the

size of a small lake Pike sees them looking at it explains

fly past circling the cavern

crawling over each other emitting an occasional squeak and
flutter

In the water the Alien Probe ROTATES as if targeting the bats
Suddenly the Probe ERUPTS--silvery cables EXPLODE out from the
probe in all directions

A bat is ensnared in by a cable The bat struggles wings
flailing SCREECHING There is the sound of SEARING FLESH--

Across the cavern another bat is taken Then another
SCREECHING and FLAPPING the bats fly panicked One bat heads
toward light at the ceiling soaring toward freedom--

It is SNARED by a cable More bats are taken and more

So Vaughtwhere are we now

Aaron considers Suddenly we CUT TO

is watching them

accidentallymaybe prematurely

We were supposed to find this
first

Marty gives up--he wants to see He pulls up his hood briefly
to wipe the visor--

Suddenly shockingly we SHOOT DOWN TOWARD MARTY--
CLOSE TOWARD HIS NECK UNDER THE HOOD TOWARD HIS EYE--
INTO A MICROCOSMIC LANDSCAPE

We are the POV of whatever was watching them When Marty
lifted his hood it attacked We--and it--move through this
bizarre truly alien world

Hair follicles--Martys eyelash--loom above big as trees
Ahead is the colorful beautiful cornea--

MOVE IN CLOSER STILL into the realm of the electron microscope
The cornea is a landscape of individual cells--

--and now we see the thing as it moves ahead into frame It
is an ALIEN OBJECT microscopic in size of course but in this
world looming large as a jetliner--

It is spiral shaped shiny--

It could be an organism or a machine--

The alien object suddenly DIVES DOWN twisting burrowing
through the microfilement of a cell INTO MARTYS EYE past the
retina plunges into the optic nerve--

BACK TO SCENE
as Marty lowers the flap of his hood The foray into the
microcosmic world has lasted just a few seconds Marty drops to

one knee blinking

The calf BLEATS again

In the brush nearby we become aware of a MOUNTAIN LION
crouched stalking forward--nine feet and three hundred pounds
of muscle It is focused on--

The calf Unaware it lets out another BLEAT
The Mountain Lion tenses ready to spring--

Suddenly a DARK SHAPE sweeps down attacks the Lion one of the

prey fighting for its life--

The Vulture flaps its wings trying to lift off--a Probe-bat
streaks by and the Vulture is gone--

Another Probe-bat dives toward the Mountain Lion razored teeth
bared in its muzzle--

The Lion screams leaps brings the Probe-bat down But two
more attack claws slashing the flank of the big cat--

More bats and the Lion is overcome Several Probe-bats latch
onto it lift it into the air They MERGE with it talons of

to the horizon--

Shouts from the boat crews as they realize what it is--

--FISH MILLIONS OF THEM all swimming towards the southeast
churning through the water turning it a glittering silver An
ichthyic stampede

The boats have nets in the water as the living wave hits--

UNDERWATER all sizes all varieties of fish SLAM into the nets
Predator and prey small and large they are pressed tight by
more fish coming from behind The net tears in places some
fish burst through--

Above the nets go taught filling quickly The boats are
buffeted They jerk around yanked along by the momentum of the
onslaught of fish tipping to netside

CAPTAIN
Haul men She dont got no pull
with the good Lord after all

The crews WHOOPING and HOLLERING haul the nets up spilling
tides of fish--tuna yellowtail snapper some dolphins--across
the decks More fish leap aboard of their own volition trying
desperately to outrace something

Nets still in the water pull the boats along the filament
screamingly taut--

Larrys net rips open the boat rocking back On the Curly the
winch creaks groans--SNAPS OFF takes a crewman over the side--

He SCREAMS as racing bodies slam into him the torrent of fish
overwhelming him carrying him under and away--

--and then just as quickly as it began
the onslaught is over The fish are past disappearing to
the southeast The waters empty going from silver to blue

The Moes crew pulls in a last netfull of fish The Larrys
nets hang limp The decks of all three boats are piled high
with flopping squirming fish

And then the Crewman spots something to the northwest the
direction the fish came from--

Something else is coming at them moving fast just beneath the
surface The water is humped cresting over the huge shape--

Godzilla doing forty knots

capsizing the Moe immediately slamming the Larry and Curly
together almost comically Crewmen go overboard as planks give
way and sea water fountains up through the deck

The two ranch hands--John and Stu last seen in the rain of

frogs--sit in a pew in the back They look out of place but
both listen raptly as the Reverend continues Unconsciously
Stu shakes a cigarette out of a pack puts it in his mouth--

taut as the Collie digs his legs trying to get away

been DARKENED by a shadow The shadow MOVES shrinking
resolving for just a moment into the shape of a FLYING BAT--

Fleer and Aaron in the water adjust their diving equipment

Fleer watches Aaron measuring him

FLEER
So Done much diving

AARON
Some At Club Med once--

FLEER
Well this is nothing like that
In cave diving youre going into
absolute pitch dark Therere
weird currents and sharp rocks--

Aaron nods Fleer clips safety line flashlight slate and
pencil onto his belt

FLEER
Just try not to panic You dont
want to be like the kid who sucked
his mouthpiece into his throat
trying to get the last cubic
centimeter of air--

They back their way into the water

AARON
If cave-diving is so dangerous
why do you do it

Fleer sets his dive watch fits his mask

FLEER
Better than the ocean There you
got eels squid jellyfish
(he shudders)
Too much weird shit

He sinks down backwards into the water Aaron follows--

EXT LAKE APOPKA - UNDERWATER - DAY

Fleer and Aaron swim through flickering shafts of sunlight
Discharged air bubbles glitter swirl toward the surface

The CAVE OPENING looms ahead They follow their flashlight
beams into darkness Fleer in the lead spots something--

Ahead the cave narrows to a tight bottleneck Fleer pulls out
packet of red dye breaks it The bright-colored dye moves
steadily away from the opening indicating a current

Fleer gives Aaron a thumbs up sign He ties his safety line
to a rock outcroppingthen removes his tank Aaron looks at
him incredulously

Still breathing through the regulator Fleer shoves his tank
through the bottleneck He then squirms through after it--

Aaron cant believe it Slowly he removes his own tank Pushes

it through ahead of him following Fleer

INT CAVE SYSTEM - UNDERWATER - DAY
POV AARON through his dive mask the narrow angle
increasing the sense of claustrophobia We hear his BREATHING

slow and steady as he moves past limestone walls

The walls give way Aaron and Fleer emerge into open water

Fleer glances up Sees the surface above Grins motions to
Aaron Swims upward--

--suddenly shockingly coming straight at him BRIGHT in the
light of his flashlight is the MOUNTAIN LION

Fleer freaks out Flails his arms legs trying to get away--

The Mountain Lion APPROACHES fangs bared in a perpetual
snarlthen floats serenely past suspended in the water moved
by the current

It spins caught in an eddy We see its pretty well torn up
A paw and some of its torso are still connected to the head but
most of the body is gone

Fleer recovers Calms himself Aaron taps him on the shoulder
Fleer holds up his hand--hes okay He scribbles on his slate
holds it up to Aaron It says RATE DOUBLED

INT CAVE SYSTEM - BAT CAVERN - DAY

Aaron breaks the surface of the underground lake Fleer is
already climbing out of the water He yanks off his mask

FLEER
God damn what was that doing
there I dont need that shit in
my life

He squirms out of his tank Aaron climbs out of the water

FLEER
(still pissed off)
And whats that smell

Aaron examines the limestone cavern Most is obscured by
darkness In one corner a waterfall splashes down Aaron
spots something moves toward it--

AARON
Over here

It is the mutilated remains of a cow Aaron crouches next to
it Fleer stares--now hes seen it all

FLEER
A cow

AARON
Odd--theres not just physical
damage Looks like chemical
deterioration as well

A sudden disorienting shift to--

POV LOOKING DOWN at Aaron and Fleer from out of a crevice
Watching them--

FLEER
Something mustve dragged it in
here The mountain lion

The thing above them SHIFTSthen leaps forward swooping down
toward them--

AARON
Maybe whatever got the mountain
lion--

Fleer jumps SWOOPING past are several small dark shapes--
bats Just normal-sized bats providing a false scare Fleer
waves at them cursing shooing them away

Aaron ignores the bats glances around the chamber
Spots something Frowns

AARON
My God

FLEER
What

He looks toward where Aaron is looking Thirty feet away is
what seems to be a unique rock formation--a GIANT CLAW as big
as a house

Aaron climbs a boulder to get a better view reaches the top
Fleer follows Beyond them we see the claw is part of a huge
forearm which is part of a massive HUNCHED ANIMAL SHAPE
filling the cavern--

THE GRYPHON

Huge Magnificent Horrible

A nightmare waiting to be born

Leathery blood-red wings like a bat The body of a mountain
lion It resembles the mythical Gryphon as in Junjis

drawings

This is what the huge bat-probe creatures created by merging
none are left to be seen Aaron and Fleer are ants before it

AARON
(awed)
the Behemoth

Aaron takes an emergency flare from Fleers belt lights it
BRIGHT LIGHT fills the cavern chasing the shadows--

Smoke drifts up from the flare High above the Gryphons nose
twitches It scowls eyes still closed--

Aaron holds the flare high They turn slightly as they look up
taking the creature in Behind them they do not see as the
giant claw CLUTCHES

FLEER
Its not alive--nothing that big
could be alive
(beat)
It goes all the way to the ceiling--

AARON
Thats not a ceiling Those are
wings

The turn back toward the huge claw--as it CLUTCHES again--

FLEER
Shit Its alive--

Fleer grabs the flare from Aaron drops it STOMPS on it It
still burns Cursing he STOMPS some more extinguishing it--

Too late The giant monster shiftsMOVES Walls of the
cavern split huge chunks of rocks fall--

Aaron and Fleer scramble back toward the lake grab up their
gear The Gryphon lets out a bone-jarring SCREAM--

Fleer looks over his shoulder sees inside its mouth--
FLEER
Oh God Its got snakes Snakes

for a tongue--

And it does Many snakes a hydra-headed thing squirming where

the tongue should be Its eyes glow yellow in the darkness
reflecting light like a cats eyes

Fleer and Aaron leap into the pool--

INT CAVE SYSTEM - UNDERWATER - DAY

Aaron and Fleer plunge in A SNAKE HEAD darts into the water

snapping blindly Aaron twists away avoids getting bitten in
half The Snake-head withdraws--

Fleer finds the safety line They pull themselves along We

hear the SOUND of BREATHING loud and fast through their

regulators--—

They reach the bottleneck Muffled ROARS of the Gryphon can be
heard Fleer and Aaron snake out of their tanks--

In the cave one of the Gryphons claws SLAMS down into the
underground lake

Water SURGES Fleer slams into the rock wall loses hold of his
regulator He swims into the bottleneck--
Aaron takes a last breath from his regulator Lets go of his
equipment Follows Fleer through the narrow opening--

They swim for the daylight--

Suddenly the earth TREMBLES--then SHAKES Beyond a rise
concessive force blasts dirt and boulders into the sky

The nightmare has been born

It blinks in the sun Screams its ear-splitting SCREAM--

They do not notice as flat lines on their monitor are
interrupted with tiny spikes--

SURVEYOR

Yeah you did Look

They look at cup--just as it leaps completely off the table
They look at each other puzzled

A beat then the entire table overturns in a blast of wind
The two look toward Godzillas jaws--

EXT TRAVELLER UTAH - GAS STATION - DAY
A balding TOURIST his family in a station wagon does that

funny little dance you do trying to get the gas hose untangled
He succeeds only in making it more twisted
In his struggles he does not notice the surrealistic sight

behind him in the distance coming over a rise in the road is
THE GRYPHON down on all fours stalking toward town slinking
along like a cat

In the station wagon a TOURIST KID notices the creature His
eyes widen He hurriedly searches for something inside a

bagrummages desperately finally pulls out--

--a video camera He switches it on aims it at the Gryphon--

Just as the Gryphon POUNCES onto a roadside bait shop SMASHING
it The Tourist turns sees the creature Drops the gas hose
dives into the station wagon The Gryphon SCREAMS--

scream The Sheriff exits the cafe stops staring past her a
look of horror on his face She turns slowly to see--

station wagon fleeing before it A panel truck going the other
way slams on its breaks The Gryphon paws at it--the truck is
hit with such force it stands up spins on one corner of the
chassis

The Sheriff rushes past the Waitress

In the truck--hurry

But the Waitress doesnt move

At the other end of town the Gryphon glances around spots
something--

The above-ground gas storage tank near the gas station Next to
it is a large propane tank

The Gryphon crouches ENERGY BEAMS SHOOT OUT and the tanks
EXPLODE--

But the Waitress chooses to run down the center of the street
The Sheriff dives into the cab--

The Gryphon beats its wings FANNING the fire A WAVE OF
FLAMING GASOLINE rolls across Traveller--

The Waitress is engulfed in flames She continues to run a few
steps burning then falls to the ground

Satisfied the Gryphon takes to the air leaving the ruins of

Jill steps out of the building People flee past her as she
stands staring at Godzilla

Tanks on the periphery of the airfield FIRE at Godzilla with
little effect Godzilla turns scanning the horizon He stops
seems to look directly at Jill Is he aware of her or staring
in her direction simply by chance We dont know

They gaze at each other sixteen years of history between them--
and then they embrace again holding on to each other

JILL
Now weve just got to find a way
off this damn island

TINA
(laughs)
»just like Gilligan

Jill smiles--and the deep THWUP-THWUP of a HELICOPTER
reverberates through the building Jill looks up--

EXT MANHATTAN - DAY

A helicopter swoops and banks trying to keep up with the
Gryphon The Gryphon soars over the buildings chasing
Godzilla who scurries along the streets sometimes on all
fours a mouse chased by a hawk

EXT WORLD TRADE TOWERS - DAY

The Gryphon spots Godzilla between the Twin Towers Scowls
realizes it is Godzillas reflection in the north tower The
Gryphon banks around swoops down toward the image--

--then turns lashes out at the Godzilla near the south tower
smashing it--

Except thats a reflection too During the Gryphons bank

turn Godzilla moved to the other side Godzilla springs at the
Gryphon teeth and claws tearing into its wings

The Gryphon throws itself backwards smashing Godzilla against
the Tower They flail violently crushing and destroy the
Towers base

EXT GOVERNORS ISLAND - DAY
In the distance dust rises from the World Trade Center One of

the towers leans over dangerously The monitors show helicopter
views of the battle Benedek Fleer and Pike are ashen

BENEDEK
Can even Godzilla beat that thing

FLEER
Dont be defeatist

AARON
(to himself)

Why isnt he using his fire

He stares at the monitors trying to figure it out

EXT MANHATTAN - SKY - DAY

The Gryphon pulls itself into the air Godzilla makes a leaping
snap for its legs--catches them hauls the Gryphon down

The Gryphon reverses its momentum suddenly sending both
monsters hard into the dangerously leaning tower
EXT MANHATTAN - DAY

ON JILL AND TINA They look up as--
The TOWER COLLAPSES--

The ground shakes beneath their feet Loose masonry crashes
down around them--

EXT GOVERNORS ISLAND - DAY

The observers are aghast--a dust cloud rises from the city the
skyline now absent one-half of the World Trade Center

And then the Gryphon appears flying shakily still aloft
It fires another bolt--

BENEDEK
Itsurvived that

AARON
The restraining device

BENEDEK
What

AARON
Weve got to get it off him Its
keeping Godzilla from using his

fire Hell its probably--

He cuts off An image on a monitor catches his eye
ON SCREEN Godzilla slumped against a building Not moving

BENEDEK
My God

AARON
Its probably killing him

PIKE
Thats a good thing Vaught We
want these things dead remember
And if one kills off the other
thats one less we have to kill

AARON

You dont get it do you Weve
got nothing to fear from Godzilla--

PIKE
Youre insane Look at what its
caused--

Aaron turns away dismissively Deals only with Benedek
AARON
Admiral weve got to get that
thing off him

Benedek looks down at Godzillas image on the monitor Reaches
a decision Looks at Aaron

BENEDEK
How

Pike starts to object--but Benedek cuts him off

BENEDEK

ON PIKES APACHE it spins out of control The Gryphons huge
paw swipes across the cockpit--and the cockpit pilot and gunner
are gone The Apache hits a roof crashes off into the street
below

Gryphon refocuses on Godzilla Screams as it dives for him--
Fleer and Aaron whirl--

See the Gryphon dropping straight for them claws extended for
the kill--

--It SLAMS into the tops of the surrounding buildings The
street is too narrow for its wingspan It SCREAMS in
frustration Then spots

A WIDE INTERSECTION The Gryphon lands Tries to move down the
street toward Godzilla Again its wingspan is too wide

The Gryphon paces back and forth snarls Its eyes narrow--an
idea occurs It folds back its wings Now it can fit between
the buildings It crosses the fissure stalks toward Godzilla
ON JILL AND TINA who are between the Gryphon and Godzilla
Jill looks up at Aaron and Fleer who are totally exposed

JILL
Uh-oh

She looks around the street Heads for an abandoned fuel
tanker Its locked She SMASHES the window with a trash can

TINA
Momyoure getting a real jones

for vandalism

JILL

Jill climbs into the cabroots around in the back Finds some
road flares Then looks at the ignition Checks behind the
visor No keys

JILL
Damn

From outside comes an eager snarl

ON AARON who hears it looks up--the Gryphon is uncomfortably
close Fleer looks up too--then returns to setting a timer

FLEER
Ignore it Just do the job

Aaron resumes reeling in the line still attached to his harness--
but keeps a wary eye peeled

AARON
(under his breath)
»-until you cant do the job
ON JILL who grabs Tinas arm hauls her into the truck

JILL
You can hot wire it right

Tinas surprised--then nods She scrambles beneath the
dashboard Strips out the wires quickly

JILL

Tina glances up at her smiles makes an adjustment The engine
grinds then starts

JILL
Can you drive it

TINA
I can find first gear

JILL
Good enoughget it rolling
toward that thing then jump

Tina nods Jill gives her a quick hug a kiss then climbs out
of the cab up on top of the truck

Tina puts it in gear--grinds em a little Starts forward

ON GODZILLA Fleer pulls another timer out of the bag

FLEER
Shit
AARON

FLEER

One of ems bustedcrap

I can only set it for thirty
seconds

Aaron looks at the street The Gryphon is nearing picking its
way across broken chunks of pavement crushing cars

AARON
Thirty seconds can be a
lifetimeDo it

Aaron ties his line off on the restraining device Fleer hooks
up the explosives

ON JILL as she scrambles back to the top hatch on the tanks
opens it Lights the flares

The truck is heading for the Gryphon The Gryphon stops
cocks its head What is this

JILL
(a mantra)

Get out Tina get out Tina get
out Tina

And then Tina jumps clear rolls She sits up stares after--

--the Tanker Jill perched on top flares blazing Heading
straight for the Gryphon picking up speed--

TINA
Get out mom get out mom get
out mom

Jill waits--waits a little longer--then drops the flares into
the tanks and JUMPS--

She lands in a pile of full garbage bags Tina runs to her--
--the truck roars toward the Gryphon And then--

The Gryphon sidesteps The truck passes between its legs It
looks down under itself following the trucks passage

TINA
Shit It missed

The truck crashes into the fissure behind the Gryphon The
Gryphon looks up--locks its stare on Jill and Tina

TINA
Oh shit

The Gryphon paces forward--
--Jill grabs Tina dodges the swipe of a huge paw pulls her
into an abandoned storefront

The Gryphons head looms huge in the shattered front window It
reaches a paw in toward Jill and Tina claws nearly reaching
them backed into a narrow recess--

Suddenly behind the Gryphon the TRUCK EXPLODES--—
--and IGNITES the GAS MAIN Another EXPLOSION The pavement
roils like a WAVE A MOVING WALL OF FLAME EXPLODES from the

street catching the Gryphon as it springs

Jill and Tina run for safety as the ground shakes dodging
falling debris

TINA
Goddammit mom you couldve let
me in on your plan

JILL
Stop cursing

ON GODZILLA Fleer and Aaron grab for handholds

FLEER
What the hell--

In the street the Gryphon is trapped in a wall of flames
panicked screaming trying desperately to spread its wings

It finally twists free demolishing buildings on either side of
the street its final SCREAM so ear-piercingly loud that windows
shatter

The Gryphon still afire climbs into the sky a falling star in
reverse

AARON
Thats going to make our
explosions look puny
FLEER
Its not the sizeits how you
use it
He sets the final charge in place Looks up at Aaron
Aaron nods rope in his hands poised to leap off the device
Fleer pushes the buttons on both charges then swings out onto
Aarons back They step off into space repelling down to a
terrace one hundred feet below
The timer counts down 21 20 19

JILL AND TINA watch as the two figures drop down the rope

The timer hits 13 12 11

Aarons harness hits frayed line tangles freezes Twenty feet
to go He cant free the line

FLEER

AARON
Frozen--I cant get it--

FLEER
Hit the release

The timer ticks off 7 6 5

Aaron yanks the release--he and Fleer drop from the rope--
THE CHARGES EXPLODE--

Aaron and Fleer hit the terrace hard--

THE RESTRAINING DEVICE BLOWS FREE--

Line begins pooling beside Aaron--his eyes widen Looks up--
The restraining device tank FALLS DIRECTLY TOWARDS THEM-—

They scramble for safety--Fleer grabs Aarons collar hauls him
out of the way just as the device CRASHES to the terrace

They lie there breathing hard--
And then the building shakes And there is a ROAR
Godzilla is awake He uses the building to haul himself up

Aaron and Fleer get the hell out of there They race down
stairs as the building collapses around them

ON JILL AND TINA as they run for the building

TINA
Did they get out

Godzilla towers above them He ROARS again And above him the
Gryphon SCREAMS Godzilla looks up

The Gryphon dives toward earth Patches of its skin are
blackened still smoking It fires a BOLT at Godzilla--

--who staggers but does not fall And then--
--Godzilla BREATHES FIRE hits the Gryphon head on--

The Gryphon screams again this time in pain and veers off
toward the East River

Godzilla ROARS again and pounds away giving chase

TINA
There they are

Aaron and Fleer emerge from the demolished building supporting
each other exhausted

But the tremors of Godzillas exit dislodge a large already
precarious sign its bulk swings down toward the two men--

They dive flat The sign barely misses them crashes to the
ground They lie there unmoving Jill and Tina reach them

JILL
Aaron--are you all right Aaron

TINA
(to Fleer)
Are you okay mister

AARON

EXT MANHATTAN - STREET - DAY

Aaron Jill Fleer and Tina run The street is plunged into
DARKNESS by the shadow of the Gryphon then back to light once
it passes Jill pulls up short--

Pike is standing right there holding the machine gun Beyond
him is the gaping entrance to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel

JILL
Pike--you bastard--

PIKE
(levels the rifle)
Please Doctor Calm down

From the river comes a scream a roar the sounds of battle--

--and them the Gryphon SMASHES down on its back intolerably
close to the group the IMPACT knocking them off their feet
The Gryphon twists to its feet--

Pike frightened sprays it with MACHINE GUN FIRE peppering the
Gryphon It reacts to the gnat-like irritation spots Pike and

the others--

TINA
The tunnel

The Gryphon lashes out at them They scramble for the tunnel--

INT TUNNEL - DAY

The group runs into the tunnel the Gryphon after them a cat
after mice It tries to reach in after them but its arm is too
large Pike bringing up the rear empties the M16 at it The
Gryphon SNARLS Opens its mouth--

Its TONGUE OF SNAKES lashes out two of them catching Pike
around the waist and leg

PIKE
Help me

Aaron catches for his arm but Pike is yanked away He is
dragged out of the tunnel into the Gryphons mouth The
Gryphon bites down--

Jill Aaron Tina and Fleer are shocked Fleer spots a large
tunnel utility truck Gestures leads them to it

EXT MANHATTAN - STREET - DAY

The Gryphon throws back its head SWALLOWING PIKE The Gryphon
shuts its eyes--twitches involuntarily From the distance comes

Godzillas ROAR

The Gryphon looks up at it Glances around the area Its eyes
fall on

THE RESTRAINING DEVICE TANK lying in the street Amniotic
fluid leaks slowly from several cracks

The Gryphon scowls narrows its eyes as though trying to

remember something--

It does It seems to smile And then--

--THE GRYPHON ROLLS ITS HEAD CRACKING ITS NECK--Pikes tic
exactly

The Gryphon pounces on the tank It glances toward the East
River Clutching the tank in its front paws the Gryphon takes
to the skies--

INT TUNNEL - DAY

The utility truck races through the tunnel ramming through
abandoned cars Fleer at the wheel hits the brakes The
truck slues to a stop The entire width of the tunnel is
blocked by a semi and trailer halfway through an aborted U-
turn

JILL
I guess we walk

They climb out hurry past the semi On the wall is a sign
Brooklyn Battery Tunnel - MIDPOINT

EXT EAST RIVER - DAY

Over the bay the Gryphon spots Godzilla Heads for him
skimming above the water

Godzilla sees the Gryphon coming Cocks his head to one side
The Gryphon holds the tank in its paws closing on Godzilla

Godzilla steps back wary almost looking for a place to retreat
to The Brooklyn Bridge is behind him He glances back at the
Gryphon--

The Gryphon squeezes the tank in anticipation Metal howls with
strain Amniotic fluid seeps out of the tank--

Godzilla sinks down into the water seemingly afraid Just his
head visible above the water line--

Suddenly Godzilla BREATHES FIRE--not at the Gryphon but ACROSS
THE WATER creating a curtain of steam An instant fog bank

The Gryphon is blinded but cant pull up--
Godzilla dives--
The Gryphon screams banks suddenly flying blind--

And then THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE looms up out of the fog The
Gryphon HITS THE BRIDGE FULL SPEED Tangles in the cabling

Drops the tank--

Godzilla erupts from the water smashes into the Gryphon--

The Gryphon tears one arm free from the cables Reaches for

the tank--

With an almost casual flip of his tail Godzilla sends the tank
flying out of the river into Manhattan The Gryphon SCREAMS in
frustration

The Gryphon twists and Godzilla becomes tangled with some
cables The Gryphon snaps its wings open--a bio-electric bolt
scrabbles across them--

The cables are electrified Godzilla is ELECTROCUTED The

Gryphon tears free slams into the reeling Godzilla Godzilla
stumbles backward--

INT TUNNEL - DAY

The tunnel SHAKES Roof tiles come loose clatter down

Another BOOM and cracks appear Water begins to seep through

AARON
I guess we run

They start running

EXT EAST RIVER - DAY

Godzilla has a deathlock on the Gryphon The Gryphon flaps
furiously straining with all its might Both monsters are
lifted out of the water--

Godzilla twists around and BITES the Gryphons WING tears a
chunk out of it--

The monsters crash back into the water--

INT TUNNEL - DAY

Jill Aaron Fleer and Tina look back over their shoulders--—

In the distance about a half-mile away the roof of the tunnel

CAVES IN--

Godzillas foot appears crushing down from the ceiling--
Hundreds of thousands of gallons of water pour in past Godzillas
leg gushing down from above Tons of water filling the

tunnel sweeping toward the foursome--

Jill spots an abandoned car--a red Subaru Its door open

JILL
In there

The ROAR of the approaching water is DEAFENING They have only
seconds They scramble for the car--

picking up speed--

Aaron behind the wheel Jill beside him Fleer and Tina in the
back They slam the doors shut--

AARON

They pull the shoulder belts across Fleer frantically searches
for his latch--its buried in the seat He digs it out The
belt tongue goes in with a soft click--

Just as the wall of water SLAMS INTO THE CAR--

INT TUNNEL - DAY

The Subaru is tossed like toy
It rolls Twists Is swept along caroms off a police car--

All are shoved along by the immense force of the water It
washes over the cars covering them filling the tunnel--

INT SUBARU - DAY

The foursome are thrown violently the seat-belts barely holding
them in place The vehicle is completely submerged Some water

seeps in but the passenger compartment for the most part holds--

Tina screams as a MANS FACE is driven hard against the side
window then washed away

FLEER
Uh-oh

The BUMPER of a bottled-water TRUCK is visible growing larger
in the windshield Theyre hurtling toward it--

INT TUNNEL - UNDERWATER - DAY

The angle of the two vehicles causes the Subaru to be shunted to
one side smashing in tight between the truck and the wall of
the tunnel A violent sudden STOP as the hood CRUMPLES

INT SUBARU - DAY

The foursome breath hard as they recover Aaron straightens
behind the wheel--and grimaces in pain unnoticed by the others

There comes the loud CREAK of metal under stress A small rear
window CRACKS with gunshot suddenness Water seeps through the
cracks

FLEER
Weve got to equalize the pressure
or its going to crush us
Everyone-- crack your window a
little bit

They do so Water pours in

FLEER
Now we can open the doors to get
out--

AARON

One problem
Jill looks over at him Gasps The steering wheel and
dashboard have been torqued pinning him She leans across

tries to wrench the wheel up

JILL
Dammit Can you wiggle out

AARON
Nonot yet

The water in the car is waist level now--and rising Fleer
leans across the seat Together he and Jill try to pull the
wheel up Nothing

TINA
Can you get the seat lever

Aaron reaches down finds it--pulls it A loud CLUNK Fleer
tries to pull the seat back No go

FLEER
(straining)
It feels like its just about to
give--

Water is at their shoulders now

AARON
Get out of here All of you

JILL
Dont be stupid

AARON
You either Get out

He tilts his head back to breath A final deep breath and he
is submerged The car is filled

UNDERWATER Aaron indicates get out Jill and Fleer holding
their breath keep trying to free him He pushes them away
Tina looks on frightened She reaches for the door latch
pushes the door open--

It hits the tunnel wall--and stops She goes wide-eyed Pushes
it a couple times No go

Jill and Fleer exchange a glance They try their doors They
are wedged shut by the bottled-water truck

Tina rolls her window all the way down--but the tunnel wall
prevents her from wriggling out The truck presents the same
obstacle on the other side

Jill Fleer and Aaron exchange a dismayed glance

EXT EAST RIVER - DAY

Godzilla holds the Gryphon beneath the water The Gryphon bucks
furiously Levers its rear legs into Godzillas belly and

pushes claws ripping flesh shoving Godzilla back

The Gryphon surfaces gasping for breath It SLASHES its wing
tips across Godzillas eyes and takes off Godzilla hits it
with a BLAST OF FIRE as it moves away--

INT SUBARU - UNDERWATER - DAY

Aaron gets an idea He reaches down and pulls the rear hatch
release It pops open The last air in the car evacuates ina
large bubble He indicates GO

Fleer shoves Tina out Hesitates Aaron gestures angrily
Fleer goes Sadly Jill takes Aarons hand A moment between
them Jill looks away--

Through the windshield is the water bottle truck There are
capped filled bottles Bubbles pour out of uncapped empty
bottles still in their racks But several racks are empty

Jill pushes away from Aaron out of the car

INT TUNNEL - UNDERWATER - DAY

Fleer and Tina swim above the Subaru The tunnel is illumined
by a weird combination of emergency lamps and headlights
stabbing through the water Jill swims up to them looking up
past them--

The ceiling is dark unknowable
A leap of faith then She gestures follow me to Fleer and
Tina and swims upward--

INT SUBARU - UNDERWATER - DAY

Aaron is not moving conserving his breath Only his eyes belay
his panic They dart from side to side Tears well up He
clenches his jaw His eyes roll back as his air runs out His
mouth opens a few last bubbles escaping--

Suddenly Jill is there swimming up to him--
--and KISSING HIM Air bubbles rise up from their lips Aaron
is shocked--realizes she has transferred air to him

Fleer is behind him then Jill braces her feet on the dashboard
and pulls up at the wheel while Fleer strains against the seat
Aaron twists--

--and comes free The three swim out of the car

INT TUNNEL - UNDERWATER - DAY

Aaron follows Jill and Fleer toward the ceiling of the tunnel
Tina waits for them buoyed up against the tiles by the three

large water bottles she is holding onto They are capped and
empty--except of course for air At the base of one theyve
made a pinhole which Tina covers with her thumb

Aaron grins Brilliant Jill takes the pinholed bottle from
Tina--air bubbles stream up as they transfer it

Jill puts her mouth to the pinhole takes a breath in
demonstration Holds the bottle out to Aaron Their faces
close together he draws a deep breath holding her gaze An
intense moment between them

Tina watching them frowns puzzled Whats going on there

Then Jill smiles at him Tilts her head toward the exit Aaron
smiles back nods

INT TUNNEL - UNDERWATER - DAY

Each with a water bottle the foursome half-swim half-walk
upside down on the ceiling making their way toward the light at
the tunnel mouth

EXT EAST RIVER - DAY

Blood from Godzillas wounds stains the water Godzilla ignores
it He stands not moving staring into the sky scanning it--
much as he did in the Taki Islands Then he stiffens--hes
spotted something a small dot in the distance

EXT MANHATTAN - SKY - DAY

The Gryphon too is wounded Literally licking its wounds It
flies slowly circling Manhattan far below It circles faster
becoming more agitated--

It SCREAMS--and sweeps its wings back It begins a power dive
straight toward Godzilla

EXT EAST RIVER - DAY

Godzilla makes a slight sound at the back of his throat--he
knows the Gryphon is coming But he doesnt move He waits

The Gryphon hurtles toward earth claws bared its speed peeling
its lips back in a viscous snarl--
Godzilla waits--
The Gryphon is nearly on Godzilla screaming toward him--

GODZILLA LEAPS FORWARD SUDDENLY EXPOSING THE THREE ROWS OF
JAGGED DORSAL FINS ALONG HIS BACK--

The Gryphon is RIPPED OPEN from stem to stern Both monsters
crash down into the river A huge impact wave races in both
directions down the East River flooding streets on either shore--

EXT TUNNEL MOUTH - DAY

Aaron emerges from the watery depths of the tunnel into
sunlight Jill Tina and Fleer right behind him A number of
military vehicles helicopters and personnel in the area

The foursome suck in air and hug in celebration--but then Aaron
freezes The others turn to see what hes staring at

EXT EAST RIVER - DAY

Godzilla shakily finds his footing He tackles the Gryphon who
struggles wildly a wounded and vicious animal It tries to get
airborne Godzilla grabs the Gryphons tail hauls it down

Godzilla levers his fingers into the Gryphons rib cage and
PULLS ITS BODY APART with a vicious CRACK--

Godzilla slams the Gryphon back into the river
He strikes like a snake teeth glinting jaws slamming shut
beneath the water--

GODZILLA TEARS THE HEAD OFF THE GRYPHON holds it up
Stares at it Its eyes are closed Its not moving--
And then the EYES SNAP OPEN--

--and the body ERUPTS from the water clawing blindly at
Godzilla even as it tries to repair itself Godzilla BREATHES
A STREAM OF FIRE into the body--

Like being microwaved the body ignites from the inside-out--
--and EXPLODES

Hanging from Godzillas hand the head snarls and bites
Godzilla gives it an almost-exasperated look--
--and SPIKES the head on jagged remains of one of the towers of
Brooklyn Bridge

The head stops snapping Weird blue eyes stare starkly
Godzilla leans close to it Stares back

It is dead Godzilla ROARS

Injured bleeding from dozens of wounds but triumphant
Godzilla begins pushing through the water back to open sea

EXT TUNNEL MOUTH - DAY

Aaron realizes hes been holding his breath Exhales in relief

TINA

JILL
I think so I hope so

Fleer stares out at the battleground The river red with blood
and ichor The head staked atop the bridge

FLEER
I dont care how much you pay
meI am not gonna help clean
this up

Suddenly from the sky comes a SCREAM--

EXT SKY - DAY

It is the SCREAM of fighter jets streaking toward them

EXT TUNNEL MOUTH - DAY

FLEER
Thats an attack formation

The jets FIRE Missiles streak toward Godzilla--
IMPACT Godzilla ROARS in pain
The jets streak past banking to come around for another pass

FLEER
(yelling at the fighter)

Hey Knock it off

AARON

JILL

She looks around--and spots
A familiar Huey Helicopter

JILL
You

The Huey Pilot turns--and is startled to see her

HUEY PILOT
Christ I thought I was rid of
you

JILL

We need your helicopter

HUEY PILOT
(laughs)
Forget it I told you--I dont
have clearance--

JILL
Im giving you the clearance--

HUEY PILOT
Screw you Bring me up on
charges I dont care No way Im
leaving the ground

There is the sound of a gun cocking--
Behind Jill Tina has leveled her pistol at the pilot

TINA
You really ought to listen to my
mom
The Huey Pilot stares agog Smiling Fleer slips the pilots
sidearm from its holster

EXT GOVERNORS ISLAND - DAY

BENEDEK

Tell Red Wing One to target its
wounds specifically--and not let
up I want saturation fire

INT FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY

The FIGHTER PILOT has Godzilla in his sites Godzilla looks up
wounded and tired showing a lot of the white of his eyes Hes
prepared to die

FIGHTER PILOT

strafing run--What the--

THE HUEY COPTER has risen up suddenly between the fighters and
Godzilla

EXT SKY - DAY

The fighters veer aside jetwash buffeting the rescue copter

EXT GOVERNORS ISLAND - DAY
Benedek has seen the action through binoculars

BENEDEK

Benedek stares at the speaker

BENEDEK

INT HUEY - DAY
The Huey Pilot at the controls nervously aware of Tina holding

the gun Tina not really paying attention lets the barrel of
her gun droop Fleer lifts it back on line with a finger

Jill is on the radio Aaron beside her

JILL
Benedek--call off the fighters

INTERCUT WITH BENEDEK

BENEDEK
Dont be insane Jill Godzilla

JILL
We cant kill Godzilla

BENEDEK
I say we can Red Wing target
the creature If the helicopter
doesnt move splash it

JILL
Benedek think We couldnt have
stopped the Gryphon without
Godzilla We know it came from
space--how many more are there

Benedek starts to say something--pauses

INT FIGHTER - DAY

The jets computer targeting system locks on to the Huey
Godzilla beyond it

FIGHTER PILOT

(into radio)
We have a lock on the target

EXT GOVERNORS ISLAND - DAY
Benedek is torn
JILL
(filtered)
(repeats it)
How many more

Its a tough call for Benedek--but he reaches for the mic

BENEDEK
Red Wing One--break off attack

EXT MANHATTAN - DAY

The jets sweep past the copter then past Godzilla Godzilla
watches them go by then turns for the sea--

And COLLAPSES suddenly just deadweight He slowly sinks out of
sight unmoving The water is stained pinkish by his blood

INT HUEY - DAY

TINA
Is itis he dead

AARON
Idont know

FLEER
Goddammit We were too late

Jill stares sadly down at the ocean She lowers her head

JILL
(a whisper)

(looks at Aaron)
I guess Im out of a job

AARON
You and me both

TINA
Hes still out there mom

JILL
(wanting to believe it)
Yeshes still out there

A pause

AARON
So what do we do

Jills response is simple she puts an arm around Tina draws
her close A momentthen she puts out a hand to Aaronwho

takes it

Together they look out at the calm water

And then Fleer spots something

FLEER
(admiration)
I knew he was a tough bastard
(points)
Look

IN THE OCEAN disturbing the surface is a V-shaped wake caused
by Godzillas passage beneath the water The wake becomes
longer as he picks up speed and heads out toward open sea

CAMERA DROPS TO BELOW THE WATER into the murky depths Silence
Godzilla isnt therebut then we hear the characteristic
BOOMING of Godzillas heart

And as the screen FADES TO BLACK we hear one last thing
GODZILLAS DISTINCTIVE ROAR

THE END
