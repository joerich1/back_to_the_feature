This is a line of hard men branded by prison shorn hair
broken nose eyes with a cold ferocity And their aggression
has a nihilistic edge their spirits never surrender

AMONG THE HARD MEN ARE

HARRY PETE PIERPONT 6 foot 1 with eerie blue eyes

Brilliant violent he hates all authority

CHARLES MAKLEY ( 44) squat with an anvil jaw facial scars

and as calm as Pierpont is volatile

HOMER VAN METER tall an incorrigible clown and an

unemotional killer He has continued to ridicule guards even

when it cost him months in the hole

INT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - J EDGAR HOOVER - DAY

MCKELLAR
(to Hoover)
Why do we need this

HOOVER

Because of the new breed of mobile

outlaws who flee jurisdiction by crossing

state lines over highways and against

whom this government must wage a war on

crime

J EDGAR HOOVER is a physically short man but has a dynamic
presence He is a dapper patrician who believes in elites

is completely free from self-doubt He is youthful and 33
years old

SUYDAM and TOLSON sit next to him

MCKELLAR ii¢Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Sub-
Committee-Hes an avuncular man of 62

MCKELLAR

And so in the middle of a Great
Depression youre looking for a budget
increase to build up your Department But
by my tally your Department of
Investigation spends more taxpayers
dollars catching crooks than what the
crooks you catch stole in the first
place

HOOVER

Thats ridiculous The Bureaus
apprehended kidnappers bank robbers who
have stolen up to

personally conducted a criminal

investigation in the field in your life

Others in the room stare at Hoover McKellar leans-back

MCKELLAR (CONT A° D )

(CONTINUING)
I think you are a front I think your
prowess as a lawman is a myth created
from a hoopla of headlines by Mr Suydam
your publicist there You are trying to
make a federal police force with you set
up as its Czar That is runnin wild in
my estimation

HOOVER
Crime is what runs wild in this country
Mr Chairman And

MCKELLAR

And if the country required an expanded
Bureau I question you are the person
most fit to run it while

HOOVER

His diction was amazing - better in many instances than

of his interviewers -- his poise no less so There Was no
hint of hardness about him no evidence save in the alert
presence of armed policemen that he had spent his formative
years in a penitentiary He had none of the sneer of-the
criminal Looking at him for the first timehelates as
the most amazing specimen of his kind ever seen outside of
