poorly-focused

lab coat puts on latex gloves A DOG sits on the counter-top

FEMALE NARRATOR (0S)
What you are about to see may

INT THE VANGUARD NEWSPAPER - EDITORIAL ROOM - MORNING

The editorial room of a tabloid Five bored REPORTERS look in
the general direction of a TV in the corner Editor-in-chief
BRADLEY CHERKIN 60 with impressive amounts of white hair on
his face and head holds the remote control

CHERKIN
(stern)
Jesus Nemser will you watch the
thing first
One of the reporters is PAUL NEMSER referred to as Nemser by
his friends colleagues family and (eventually if he ever
has them) his children He still has a boyish handsomeness
but his paunch and bald spot indicate that he’s on the wrong
side of 40 and very much on the wrong side of 30

NEMSER
(shrugs)
I’m just saying Ill do it

A meek reporter TIM raises his hand

TIM
I’m also happy to take this one
CHERKIN
Oh youre “happy” to write this
article
(barks )
I don’t even know your name
TIM
It’s--
CHERKIN

I don’t want to know your name I
just want you to know that I don’t
know it

Tim looks shamed Cherkin presses play

ON THE TV SCREEN the female narrator LYDIA SHERIDAN late
20s appears in front of a black background She’s beautiful
and severe

LYDIA
Huntingdon Lab is a for-profit
animal-testing company which
conducts tests on thousands of
animals every year from rats to
primates I spent six months
undercover at Huntingdon with this
hidden camera sewn into my lab
coat

Lydia holds out a tiny camera between her thumb and
forefinger

LYDIA (CONTD)
I saw scenes of unimaginable
cruelty The scientists mocked the
animals They abused them They
played with them when they weren’t
in the mood for playing

(MORE )
LYDIA (CONTD)
It brings to mind what Paul
McCartney once said “If
slaughterhouses had glass walls
everyone would be a vegetarian” We
should listen to him because Macca
was the best Beatle Much better
than John

Nemser tilts his head amused

LYDIA (CONTD)
What follows is uncensored footage
of this shocking brutality If you
have young children now is the
time for them to leave the room
If you have animals now is the
time to cherish them

Shaky grainy footage A FEMALE SCIENTIST hands on hips
stares down at a mouse in a cage

FEMALE SCIENTIST
Youre just a mouse I’m a person
Youre tiny

A male scientist injects a needle into a rat The camera
zooms in menacingly on a scientific paper beside the
scientist The title reads “TOWARDS A CURE FOR CHILDHOOD
LEUKEMIA” The camera quickly pans away from the document

Another SCIENTIST stands with a small cup of juice

LYDIA (0S)
(muffled)
What are you doing with that juice

SCIENTIST
I’m giving it to the monkey

LYDIA (0S)
(muffled)
Are you sure it’s his favorite kind
of juice

SCIENTIST
No I’m not sure

He walks away Lydia angles the hidden camera on her lab coat
at her face

Nemser and smiles

MUSIC CUE “All The Young Punks” by The Clash

INT MCDONALD’S - DAY

GEORGIE 16 acned and greasy sits alone eating fries He’s
eaten a lot of fries in his young life Georgie stares at the
wall bored

He throws some of the fries at the wall He enjoys this and
throws some more

RAJIV 16 Indian and timid comes over and sits next to him
throwing his backpack on the ground

RAJIV
Throwing fries

GEORGIE
Yeah

Rajiv tries throwing some fries at the wall He shrugs

RAJIV
It’s been two weeks Not coming
back are you

GEORGIE
Maybe next term I dunno What was
I learning in school that I can’t
learn right here

They stare at the french fries and half-eaten hamburger in
front of Georgie

RAJIV
You should come back man

GEORGIE
I’m an autodidact Rajiv Do you
know what that means It means I
teach myself Do you know how I
know that word I taught it to
myself

Rajiv shrugs again He stands up
RAJIV

GEORGIE
We could do stuff

RAJIV
Can’t Gotta work

GEORGIE
(a little desperate)
Whatever you wanna do--

RAJIV
(firm)
I can’t I have homework

INT THE VANGUARD - NEWSROOM - DAY

Nemser is on the phone at his desk annoyed He’s holding a
notepad and pen and his legs are propped on the desk

NEMSER
Ms Yawson Ms Yawson Miiissss
Yawwwwsonnnnn

He looks at CECILE a chubby 40some reporter whose desk faces
his and flaps his hand to indicate “she’s going on and on
and on” Cecile looks disgusted

NEMSER (CONT’D)
Ms Yawson I know this is a hard
time for you I know exactly how
you feel

He listens

NEMSER (CONT’D)
(stammers lying)
Yes I’ve had a spouse murdered
It’s very difficult

Cecile throws him another look

NEMSER (CONT’D)
And I certainly don’t want to
interrupt the grieving process
Grieving is like making a cake You
take your time you have patience
and at the end of it you finally
have closure Or a cake
(beat listens)
I just need one quote that’s all
(MORE )
NEMSER (CONTD)
How you feel how this has affected
you -- something

He listens

NEMSER (CONTD)
Hmm Can you give me a little more
pizzazz “Sad” is such a mundane
word How about“distraught”

He nods and writes on his notepad

NEMSER (CONT’D)

Good great Let me just read this
back to you

(reads his notepad)
‘Im distraught’ shrieked
hysterical widow Eliza Yawson
‘I will personally track down his
killers and I will take vengeance
upon them’

(looks up)
That last part’s mine Adds a bit
of zest

Beat

NEMSER (CONT’D)
Ms Yawson

He shrugs and hangs up the phone He takes a little flask out
of his desk and takes a nip

CECILE
Youre a horrible man You have no
empathy The only thing you’re good
at is cutting people down and
making them feel bad about
themselves

Nemser thinks
NEMSER
(stammers )
Youre a horrible man
CECILE

Huh Maybe there’s nothing you’re
good at

EXT STREETS - AFTERNOON

MUSIC CUE “The World Is Full of Crashing Bores” by Morrissey

Georgie walks alone down working-class streets kicking an
empty bottle He passes a graffiti-covered wall and stops to
read some of the messages “Fuck Bush” “End the war”
“Abortion is murder”

Georgie digs in his backpack and takes out a black marker He
finds a blank space on the wall and writes

“STRONG OPINIONS SUCK”
He’s working on the final “K” when he hears

MAX (0S)
Look -- Georgie Porgie thinks he’s
a rebel

The music sputters to a STOP and Georgie grits his teeth and
turns around MAX and TRAVIS two fierce-looking bullies
stare at him with dead eyes Travis comes up and pins Georgie
against the wall with his index finger

TRAVIS
Georgie Porgie thinks he’s God
doesn’t he Thinks he can do
whatever he wants Skip school
write on city property But there
are rules Georgie Porgie Rules we
all have to follow

MAX
Do you read the Bible

GEORGIE
I started it but I don’t like that
main guy Moses He’s a downer
(mocking)
“Oh no my people are enslaved in
the land of Egypt It’s like suck
it up Moses

Max slams him against the wall again Georgie winces Max
puts his face an inch from Georgie’s

MAX
You need some rules in your life
Georgie Porgie You know the 10
Commandments don’t you

Georgie struggles but can’t escape
TRAVIS

Like “Honor Thy Mother And Thy
Father”
MAX
But you don’t have a father so for
you I guess it’s just “Honor Thy
Mother And”

TRAVIS
“Honor Thy Mother And” And what
That’s an incomplete commandment
Georgie manages to squirm free and runs off
MAX
(calling)

Go run home to mommy and

They high-five

TRAVIS

Nice We totally wounded his soul
MAX

That’1l teach him not to have a

dead dad

INT THE VANGUARD - NEWSROOM - EVENING

The newsroom is empty except for Nemser and dark except for
his desk lamp

He slumps in his chair sipping from a flask reading a
FRAMED NEWSPAPER

It’s an issue of The Vanguard from March 25 1965

The banner headline reads “Freedom March Arrives In
Montgomery”

Sub-headline reads “Activists Demand Protection Of Voting
Rights”

There’s a photograph of Martin Luther King Jr leading
marchers

CLOSE ON The byline The author of the article is LAWRENCE
NEMSER Paul’s father

CHERKIN (0S)
Come get a drink Paul

Nemser looks up Cherkin is just leaving his office a coat
slung over his arm

CHERKIN (CONT’D)
Everyone’s at Barney’s
Nemser nods

NEMSER
I’1l meet up

Cherkin leaves

Nemser puts the framed newspaper back on the wall

INT GEORGIE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - EVENING

A dirty cramped bedroom with a sloping ceiling There are
scattered soda cans bowls of week-old pasta and other
paraphernalia of teenage life

An old boombox pumps “Remote Control” by The Clash-- very
loud

Georgie lies on his bed looking at a framed photograph
CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPH

It’s a black and white photograph of WILLIAM SHELDON Georgie’s
father He’s in his twenties passionate and fiery wearing
AVIATOR SUNGLASSES He stands on a car addressing a crowd of
young protestors jabbing his fist in the air

Georgie’s mom JANIE yells faintly in the background

JANIE (0S)
Georgie

Georgie scrambles to put the photograph in a drawer

He takes out an old laptop opens it and puts it on his
stomach He starts typing

Janie continues yelling as she approaches his room Georgie
doesn’t react

JANIE (0S) (CONTD)
Georgie

The door swings open violently and Janie stands there wiry
and veiny wearing a conservative black pantsuit smoking a
cigarette

JANIE (CONTD)
Georgie I can barely hear
anything Turn that goddamn music

up

Georgie smiles and turns up the volume Janie sings along for
a few seconds miming into an imaginary microphone She knows
every word

She comes over and sits on his bed turns down the volume
and rubs Georgie’s hair Georgie keeps typing as they talk

JANIE (CONTD)
Go to school today

GEORGIE
No

JANIE
Good Fuck the state

GEORGIE
You go to work

JANIE
(nods )
And I did an extra shift for Dottie
so she could see her kid’s ballet
recital

GEORGIE
Yeah fuck the state The Mans
always trying to keep Dottie from
those ballet recitals

Janie laughs and stands up

JANIE
(sincere)
Go to school now and then Georgie

GEORGIE
Mom

JANIE
I know Listen I know and I agree
with you and I think you’re better
than that place and I think you
could teach there if you wanted
to But let’s keep up appearances
shall we

Georgie raises an eyebrow but says nothing

Janie gestures towards the laptop

JANIE (CONTD)
What are you making

GEORGIE
It’s an application that let’s
people transfer porn faster

JANIE
I thought you already made that

GEORGIE
This one’s faster Not by much but
every little bit helps

JANIE
What happened to that great history
website you made With all that
Roman Empire stuff

GEORGIE
It’s still there But I took down
most of the Roman Empire stuff and
replaced it with porn

Beat
GEORGIE (CONTD)
I wouldn’t really call it a history
website anymore
Janie smirks -- a little sadly -- and walks to the door

JANIE
Glad to see you’re not letting your
talents go to waste

Georgie turns up the music and Janie leaves the room closing
the door behind her

INT BAR - NIGHT

The staff of The Vanguard enjoys a night out at a local bar
Everyone seems to be chatty and buzzed -- except for Nemser
who is silent and drunk and sitting alone at the bar His
bicycle helmet is on the counter next to his drink

Savrin comes up behind Nemser and slaps him on the back
hard

SAVRIN
(caustic)
How’s it going buddy

Nemser swivels in his chair and stairs at Savrin

NEMSER
(drunk)
How old are you You’re nothing
old You could be my son I could
build model rockets with you and I
could take you to the park and we
could have a great time with the
rockets That’s how old you are

SAVRIN

Is that right Well then pops
you’ll never guess what I did
today Spent the whole day with
that animal rights protestor She’s
gorgeous isn’t she And they’re
having a giant protest tomorrow
and I’m gonna cover it and Cherkin
already promised me the front page

NEMSER
(outraged)
He what
SAVRIN

Your little boy’s all grown up

Nemser staggers to his feet and pushes past Savrin He’s
looking for Cherkin but he has to go by Cecile first

CECILE
(flat)
Breaking news Nemser’s drunk
again

NEMSER
You-- you are just-- middle-aged

He pushes by her He spots Cherkin not even tipsy holding a
glass of unsipped scotch and speaking to a small group of
OLDER EDITORS

Nemser grabs him around the shoulders

NEMSER (CONT’D)
I gotta talk to you

CHERKIN
Oh Jesus Nemser Alright Someone
hold my glass for a minute

The editors hold out their hands to take the glass but Nemser
swoops in and grabs it

NEMSER
I’1l hold it

He finishes off the scotch in one gulp

NEMSER (CONTD)
Actually one of you needs to hold
this

He shoves the empty glass into an editor’s hand and drags
Cherkin by the arm to

EXT BAR - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
The sidewalk

NEMSER
Fifteen years I’ve been at this
fucking rag I’m married to this
paper Brad It’s my wife And
youre taking her away from me and
I don’t know why

CHERKIN
I’m not taking anything from you

NEMSER
Yes you are Last week the
veterans march I wanted it and
you gave it to Savrin Today this
animal rights thing I wanted it
You gave it to Savrin And you’re
putting it front page This paper
is my wife Brad When you give
Savrin a front page story it’s
like you’re letting him write on my
wife’s face

CHERKIN
Those are inspirational stories
Uplifting shit That’s never been
your thing You’re a hatchet man
You write dark angry sarcastic
stuff and it’s wonderful Readers
love it

NEMSER
(faintly)
I can do inspirational

CHERKIN
Come on Nemser Savrin’s young
He’s naive He still thinks a
journalist can change the world
same as your father It’s silly
But if a kid beats cancer or a dog
saves his owner he’s my guy Give
him 300 words and he’1ll make your
heart swell But if it looks like a
famous actress is fatter than
usual That’s all you You’re my
man on that

Nemser looks unconsoled Cherkin puts his hand on Nemser’s
shoulder

CHERKIN (CONT’D)
You can make people angry and you
can make them horny Often at the
same time That’s a special gift
and most men who have it are in
jail

Beat

NEMSER
(quietly)
I turn 45 next month My dad was 45
when he won his Pulitzer--

CHERKIN
(laughing)
--Ah That’s what this is You
Freudian fuck Listen to me Your
father was a fine journalist And
he gave you the best gift a father
can give a son

NEMSER
A Jeep He never gave me a Je--

CHERKIN
--His death Nemser He’s dead Has
been for several years So put on
some sunscreen and crawl out from
his fat fucking shadow

Cherkin walks inside leaving Nemser swaying on the sidewalk

INT NEMSER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A small dark disheveled studio

There’s a mattress on the ground No sheets
A key jiggles in the lock

The door swings open and Nemser staggers in absolutely
smashed humming “I Am The Walrus” He flips on the light

He flops onto the mattress After a few moments he lifts his
head up and sees on the windowsill a RED SCRUNCHIE and a
GOLD MEDALLION

INT NEMSER’S APARTMENT - LATER

Nemser sits on his mattress still drunk playing with the
scrunchie and medallion as though they’re two action figures

NEMSER

(female voice)
I love you Paul’s Dad’s Pulitzer
Prize for Journalism

(deep male voice)
I love you Paul’s ex-girlfriend’s
scrunchie that she left here when
she walked out on him without even
saying goodbye

He pushes the scrunchie and the medal together as though
they’re making out Then he takes them apart

NEMSER (CONT’D)
male voice)
You know who sucks

Paul

Yeah He’s a disappointment
female voice)
As a son or as a person
male voice)
Both
female voice)
I never actually loved him Don’t
tell Paul
male voice)
At least he was good at sex
though right
female voice)

Nope

Nemser chucks the scrunchie and medallion against the wall
He covers his face with his hand

After a few moments Nemser staggers to his feet He
retrieves the scrunchie and medallion and carefully places
them back on the windowsill

INT HUMAN MOUTH

CLOSE ON French fries entering the mouth The mouth chews on
the fries The teeth tear open a ketchup packet The ketchup
is squirted into the mouth

INT MCDONALD’S - DAY

Georgie eats fries at McDonald’s Bored He’s reading John
Locke’s “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding”

GEORGIE
(mutters )
No John God hath not furnished
man with such faculties Idiot

He tears out a page in the book crumples it up and throws
it against the wall There are already many crumpled pieces
of paper on the ground Some fries suddenly bounce off the
wall and land on top of them

We hear RETCHING

EXT MCDONALDS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

A WOMAN waits outside of an occupied bathroom There is more
retching and then a splash Someone’s vomiting More
retching another splash This goes on for a while

Suddenly the door swings open and Nemser walks out wiping
his mouth with the back of his hand He’s wearing the same
clothing as last night and looks like shit

Nemser looks at the woman in line then looks inside the
bathroom he’s just walked out of

NEMSER
It was the guy before me

He walks to the front entrance and is about to open the door
when he spots Georgie tearing another page out of his book
Nemser strides over and snatches the book

GEORGIE
What the fuck

Nemser peers at him and then at the front cover

NEMSER
This guy practically invented
political philosophy He gave us
our rights What have you ever
done

GEORGIE
Your mom

NEMSER
My mom Yes I see how you did
that Very clever You’re a clever
guy Guess that means you’re clever
enough to rip pages out of John
Locke

GEORGIE
Guess it does

Nemser glares at him for a beat
NEMSER
I did your mom How about that I
did your mom

He flings the book back towards Georgie and walks out

Georgie shakes his head (as in what a weirdo”) and goes
back to reading

Just then a CROWD begins chanting in the distance
CROWD (0S)
A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy A

rat is a pig is a dog is a boy

Intrigued Georgie wanders out of the McDonald’s and into

INT SHOPPING MALL - CONTINUOUS

He walks out of the mall

EXT SHOPPING MALL - CONTINUOUS

The mall faces a large field On the other side of the field
is the Huntingdon Lab Thousands of protestors have packed
into the field facing a stage set up next to the lab

The protestors chant and wave placards reading “Meat is
Murder” “Fur is Murder” “Vivisection is Murder” etc

EXT HUNTINGDON LAB - CONTINUOUS
The crowd continues the same chant in the background

By the stage Savrin chats with Lydia and CHE an extremely
tall and extremely thin man wearing a ski-mask Lydia’s
preparing to go on A group of POLICEMEN guard the stage

SAVRIN
And you know -- off the record -- I
really admire what you’re doing
All of us at The Vanguard do

LYDIA
Thanks Mark

CHE
Thanks man

SAVRIN
(to Lydia flirtatious)
And if there’s anyway I can help
out—-

LYDIA
Youre already helping out just by
covering us It’s so important We
have to be press sluts in this
business

SAVRIN
But I mean -- if there’s something
more direct I’d love to get my
hands dirty

Che and Lydia glance at each other Che lowers his voice
conspiratorially

CHE
Let me ask you a question How much
do you like animals

SAVRIN
A lot

Che leans over to Lydia
CHE

(whispers )
That’s a really good answer

LYDIA
(to Savrin)
Also who’s your favorite Beatle

Before he can answer Savrin spots Nemser swimming through
the crowd towards them A look of fury crosses Savrin’s face
but he quickly contains himself

SAVRIN
Hey Nemser Come meet the
wonderful folks responsible for all
this

He walks over to Nemser to lead him over

SAVRIN (CONTD)
(whispers )
What the fuck are you doing here

NEMSER

(whispers )
Little freelancing I’m writing my
own inspirational article Gonna
inspire the shit out of people
(normal voice)
Lydia Hey Hi Great to meet you
finally I saw you in that video
You were wonderful

LYDIA
Thank you but it -- it wasn’t
really about me

NEMSER
Oh and the animals They were just
terrific of course You could
really feel their pain

LYDIA
(perturbed)
Yes

Savrin barely controls his anger

SAVRIN
(introducing)

This is--
NEMSER

--Paul Nemser I work with Mark
here on The Vanguard Isn’t Mark
just a fantastic journalist Did
you read his wonderful piece about
that pedophile last year

(MORE )

NEMSER (CONTD)
So moving Just unbelievable how
Mark was able to understand that
guy I wouldn’t have any idea how
to get into the mindset of a
sociopathic pedophile but Mark
just did it so easily Seamlessly
really

SAVRIN
Youve probably heard of Paul’s
father Lawrence Nemser What a
courageous journalist -- he won a
Pulitzer for his coverage of the
civil rights marches out of Selma
No Pulitzers yet for Paul but only
because there’s no category for
articles which include the phrase
“Ms Lohan later vomited on the
bathroom floor” But I’m sure his
dad would be very proud of him if
he were still here That’s how kind
his dad was

NEMSER
Mark has one ball
SAVRIN
That’s just not true
LYDIA
Your name is Paul
NEMSER
Yeah
LYDIA

That’s the best male name ever
That’s the number one male name

NEMSER
Um Thank you

LYDIA
You’re welcome Paul Paul
McCartney’s first name is Paul

NEMSER
Yes

Nemser extends his arm to Che

NEMSER (CONTD)
(to Che)
We haven’t met yet Paul

CHE
Che Nice to meet you man

NEMSER
I love the ski mask

CHE
(modest)
Oh this This is just something
simple I threw on

NEMSER
Can I ask why

CHE
Oh I was helping--

LYDIA
--We don’t discuss internal
operations Suffice it to say Che
was assisting in the liberation of
animals and his identity was
compromised

NEMSER
(bemused)
Liberation

LYDIA
(cold)
We’re an abolitionist movement

NEMSER
Uhhuh

Nemser takes out a notepad Seeing this Savrin angrily takes
out his as well

LYDIA
(cold)
I’m not going to call you Paul
anymore You are now “Mr Nemser”

NEMSER
That’s fine Listen I was looking
at some of these signs

He gestures to the crowd
NEMSER (CONTD)

It seems like a lot of things are
murder Meat--

LYDIA
Meat is murder of course
NEMSER
Vivisection is murder
LYDIA
Yes
NEMSER
Fur
LYDIA
Definitely
NEMSER
(joking)
I guess killing a person is murder
too
LYDIA
(serious)

Sometimes

An ASSISTANT comes up to them and points at her watch

ASSISTANT
(to Lydia)
Time
LYDIA
OK

(to Nemser )
I have to get up there It was very
nice--

NEMSER
--One more thing This chant A rat
is a pig is a dog is a boy I think
some people might argue that a rat
is not a boy

Lydia starts heading up the stairs by the side of the stage
LYDIA
Great question That’s actually
something I address in my speech

Savrin glares at Nemser jealous

Lydia reaches the stage and takes the mic She loudly joins
in the chant

LYDIA (CONTD)
(with crowd)
A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy A
rat is a pig is a dog is a boy
(quiets the crowd)
Thank you Thank you

The crowd hushes

LYDIA (CONTD)
I want to start with a question I
hear a lot Some people wonder how
is a rat like a boy They look
different They have different DNA
They have very different
intellectual capabilities To these
people I reply

(angry)
Shame Shame Shame

She looks directly at Nemser and wags her finger The crowd
joins in the chant

LYDIA (CONTD)
(along with crowd)
Shame Shame Shame

Savrin ecstatic looks at Nemser and wags his finger too

SAVRIN
(along with crowd)
Shame Shame Shame

Nemser looks bemused once again

EXT HUNTINGDON LAB - LATER

Lydia is still speaking Savrin is enraptured following her
every word furiously taking notes Nemser looks like he
can’t believe what he’s hearing

LYDIA
And Jonas Salk used those results
to develop a polio vaccine that has
saved millions of lives And so to
Jonas Salk we say Shame
(crowd and Savrin join in)
Shame Shame Shame Shame

She silences the crowd

LYDIA (CONTD)

And to the rhesus monkeys he tested
on we say Sorry about that
rhesus monkeys

(everyone joins in but

it’s disjointed)
Sorry about that rhesus monkeys
Sorry about that rhesus monkeys

CLOSE ON Nemser baffled Everyone’s chanting except him

CLOSE ON Georgie baffled He’s standing in the back of the
crowd Everyone’s chanting except him

EXT HUNTINGDON LAB - LATER

LYDIA
Is it worth it to kill a single dog
if by doing so we can develop a
drug that saves 100 children That
is a very tough philosophical
question I don’t have the answer
to it But I know someone who
might

She crouches by the side of the stage and Che hands her an
ADORABLE PUPPY She goes back to the mic and holds up the

PUPPY -

LYDIA (CONTD)
This puppy

The crowd swoons Lydia hands the puppy back to Che

LYDIA (CONTD)
A new day has dawned for Huntingdon
Lab There is a genocide happening
in this building and the Animal
Liberation Front will not rest
until it is stopped That’s what
Paul McCartney would want We will
maintain a constant vigil here
until this place of torture and
murder is shuttered for good--

Lydia continues speaking but we only hear it in the
background Nemser shakes his head

NEMSER
(to himself)
She’s a demagogue

SAVRIN
(sotto)
No she’s passionate but you
probably don’t even know what that
means
(enamored)
Plus she’s beautiful

Nemser glances at Savrin who’s staring at Lydia with puppy-
dog eyes

NEMSER
(sotto)
Well you can have her I don’t
sleep with demagogues

SAVRIN
(sotto)
That doesn’t even scratch the
surface of who you don’t sleep
with

There’s a hubbub near the back of the crowd Everyone turns
to watch and Lydia stops speaking mid-sentence

Georgie has stripped to the waist and written “PRO-TEST”
across his chest He’s holding up a sign on which he’s
scrawled “PRO ANIMAL TESTING” And he’s standing on a picnic
table chanting

GEORGIE
(chanting)
Meat is delicious Fur is fine
What does vivisection mean Meat is
delicious Fur is fine What does
vivisection mean

The protestors near him approach the table and shout back
angrily Lydia nods to the policemen standing near the stage

LYDIA
(off-mic)
Security
(on-mic )
A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy

The crowd cheers The policemen run towards Georgie Georgie
points towards Lydia

GEORGIE
(chanting)
A terrorist is a terrorist is a
terrorist is kinda hot but she’s a
terrorist

Nemser laughs The policeman surround the picnic table and
take Georgie off it He’s struggling

Nemser gestures to Lydia

NEMSER
(to Savrin)
You can have this story I just
found a better one

He sprints off towards Georgie who’s now surrounded by a
ring of policemen They’re simultaneously trying to drag him
towards a squad car and fight off the protestors lunging at
him

NEMSER (CONTD)
(shouting)
Hey what’s your name

Georgie is thrown into a squad car and the car peels away

NEMSER (CONTD)
Fuck

Nemser watches crestfallen as his story is driven away
Lydia begins speaking again but it’s in the background and
unintelligible

Suddenly out of the corner of his eye Nemser spots
something on the picnic table He runs over It’s the torn-up
John Locke book He flips to the inside cover

CLOSE ON inside cover “Georgie Sheldon” is scrawled in the
upper corner

Nemser smiles and pockets the book

EXT GEORGIE’S HOUSE - EVENING

Nemser bikes through a working-class neighborhood squinting
at the street numbers He screeches to a stop in front of
Georgie’s small one-floor house

He locks his bike to a street sign double-checks the address
on a slip of paper and walks up to the door

He knocks The door opens and Georgie stares at him He’s
eating a bowl of Ramen

NEMSER
You probably don’t remember me but
—

GEORGIE
(calling)
Mom This guy claims he did you

NEMSER
What No

Janie in a staid ladysuit strolls over from the kitchen

JANIE
(to Nemser )
Ill take your word for it I’ve
led quite the life

NEMSER
No No it was a joke

JANIE
(casual)
OK then I guess we didn’t I mean
I defer to you You’re the
authority on this

Georgie’s still eating Ramen

GEORGIE
(mouth full)
My mom’s had many sexual partners

NEMSER
So I gathered
(awkward beat)
You know and that’s fine I’ve had
many myself

GEORGIE
I don’t think you mean “many” in
the sense that I mean “many”

Janie nods

NEMSER
(awkward)
I see It occurs to me that I’ve
learned a lot about you very
quickly Ms Sheldon

JANIE
(very fast)
Lycroft actually Janie Sheldon
was Georgie’s father This was in
the early 90s We were living ina
boarding house doing a lot of H
engaging in a lot of risky sex
(MORE)

JANIE (CONTD)
Have you seen Trainspotting It was
kind of like Trainspotting but
more dramatic Lots of partners
sometimes for money sometimes for
drugs sometimes for neither not a
lot of protection When Georgie
was nine his dad died of an
overdose That helped me kick
drugs but then I got ovarian
cancer at 32 which is nearly
unheard of But I kicked the cancer
-- though it’s left a few lingering
issues gynecologically-speaking --
then I kicked the drugs and here
we are

Incredibly awkward beat
NEMSER
(slow awkward)
I see Thank you for sharing so
much You shared a lot of
information Thank you
Beat
NEMSER (CONT’D)
Would you like to know who I am and
why I’m in your house

INT GEORGIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

A cramped cluttered kitchen Janie Georgie and Nemser sip
tea at the table

GEORGIE
JANIE
No No article

Nemser is taken aback

NEMSER
Don’t you want recognition for what
you did

JANIE

What he did He took off his shirt
and wrote on his belly with a magic
marker

NEMSER
(grasping)
And don’t you want recognition for
it
GEORGIE

Listen Nemser--

NEMSER
--Oh please call me whatever the
fuck you want Don’t be restrained
by societal conventions

GEORGIE
Mister Nemser--

JANIE
Don’t talk to my son like that And
I’ve raised him to question
societal conventions thank you
very much Georgie let’s show him
our pockets

GEORGIE
Mom

JANIE
(stern)
Let’s show him our pockets

Georgie reluctantly raises his shirt a few inches and shows
Nemser his pockets Janie does the same All of their pockets
have been sewn up

JANIE (CONTD)
Sewed ‘em up

NEMSER
Bravo
JANIE
Do you want to know why
GEORGIE
Mom
JANIE

(to Georgie)
No I’m removing his blinders This
is the greatest day of his life
(to Nemser )
Pockets Mr Nemser are for
storing the instruments of
capitalist exploitation

GEORGIE
(apologetic)
Moms a Marxist

NEMSER
How do you hold things while you’re
walking

JANIE
Things Society and it’s love
affair with things

NEMSER
What if you have a pack of gum

JANIE
Oh well for gum I added this

She reveals a little pocket she’s sewn on to the side of her
pants

NEMSER
A pocket

JANIE
(angry but wry)
It’s a gum pouch Mr Nemser You
know I can’t save you from the
system if you are the system

She walks out

NEMSER
What does she do
GEORGIE
She’s an administrative assistant
at Pepsi
NEMSER
(disbelief)
And she’s a Marxist
GEORGIE
Uh huh
NEMSER

--Who works at one of the largest
multinational corporations in the
world

GEORGIE
Yeah

NEMSER
(announcer-style)
Coming soon The proletariat takes
on the bourgeoisie Brought to you
by Pepsi

GEORGIE
(defensive)
She had to feed us After my dad--

NEMSER
(commercial-style)
Tired after a long day of
overthrowing your capitalist
overlords and securing the means of
production Reach for a refreshing
Mountain Dew

GEORGIE
Hey fuck you She was a radical
(pointing to a photo on
the wall)
Seattle ‘99 WTO protest She
spent three days in jail

The photo shows Janie dressed in black leather with a black
bandana covering her face

GEORGIE (CONTD)
When my dad died she had to take
care of me She’s not hypocritical
She’s just a mom

Nemser looks at his feet repentantly

GEORGIE (CONTD)
Activism is selfish

NEMSER
Well I dunno if it’s--

GEORGIE
(suddenly emotional)
Yes it is It’s extremely fucking
selfish Activism is all about the
fucking activist

Georgie trembles and tries to regain his cool

Nemser is taken aback by the outburst He clears his throat
and changes the subject
NEMSER
Listen Georgie I think you did
something very brave today This
animal testing thing is an
important issue and we desperately
need a voice on the other side of
it That’s why I want to write this
article

GEORGIE
Not because you’re a tabloid
reporter and you’‘re looking for a
good polemical article

NEMSER

(caught stammers)
Of course not That’s very cynical

(changes the topic)
And what are you 16 You deserve
to get beaten up for knowing a word
like “polemical” When I was 16 I
got beaten up for knowing the word
“perpendicular” And everyone knows
that word

GEORGIE
Maybe that’s not why you were
beaten up

NEMSER
(indignant)
Of course it is Otherwise I was
extremely popular

Georgie sighs

GEORGIE
Mr Nemser--

NEMSER
Just “Nemser” is fine

GEORGIE
I didn’t do anything brave today I
wasn’t starting any movement I
just thought that woman was
annoying--

NEMSER
--A demagogue

GEORGIE
Yeah I didn’t like how she made
her case But maybe she’s right
(MORE )

GEORGIE (CONTD)

My mom thinks so She thinks that
place should be shut down I don’t
know the first thing about animal
rights or animal testing or
anything I actually think fur is
wrong I don’t even think meat’s
delicious Beef is pretty good but
chicken is boring as shit

Nemser deflates
GEORGIE (CONTD)
It wasn’t a big deal I was bored
I had a magic marker and I like
writing things on my stomach I
mean look

He pulls up his shirt On his stomach in the same black
marker it reads “Ramen Rulez”

GEORGIE (CONT’D)
Now are you gonna write a story
about how much I like Ramen
EXT STREETS - NIGHT

MUSIC CUE “At The Zoo” by Simon and Garfunkel

Nemser bikes through the dark A headlight on the handlebars
provides a narrow swathe of light

He looks to his left and sees a dog on a leash peeing on a
building

He looks to his right and sees a dog-walker picking up his
dog’s crap with a plastic baggie

Now that he’s noticing it Nemser looks around and sees
dozens of people walking behind their dogs and picking up
their crap in little baggies It’s a national pastime

EXT THE VANGUARD - NIGHT

Nemser locks up his bike and trudges into the building

INT THE VANGUARD - NEWSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nemser walks to his desk He passes Cecile at her desk She
looks up at him positively overjoyed Grinning ear to ear

NEMSER
Are you having a stroke

She shakes her head Nemser sits down at his desk Cecile
keeps watching him still smiling broadly

NEMSER (CONT’D)
Huh Well it can’t be good news
about your husband or children
because that would require a
husband or children I give up
What do you have in your life that
you could possibly be happy about

CECILE
(squealing happily)
Cherkin’s furious that you went off
on your own assignment I think he
might fire you

She claps her hands together happily

CECILE (CONTD)
Oh joyous day

NEMSER
(to himself scared)
Fuck

He frantically punches his keyboard to wake up his computer
and then takes a very long swig from his flask

NEMSER (CONTD)
(to himself)
Sorry Georgie

He flexes his fingers and starts typing

NEMSER (CONT’D)
(mumbles to himself as he
types)
“RK local high-school dropout
launched a fiery counter-protest at
Huntingdon Lab today charging the
Animal Liberation Front with fear-
mongering and demagoguery”

INT THE VANGUARD - NEWSROOM - LATER
Nemser in a sweat punches a button on his keyboard and the

article begins printing He grabs the page from the printer
and sprints towards Cherkin’s office but he immediately--

Bumps into Cherkin

CHERKIN

I need to speak to you
NEMSER

You want uplifting Here’s

uplifting

He holds out the page Cherkin takes it without breaking eye
contact with Nemser

INT CHERKIN’S OFFICE - LATER

Cherkin sits at his desk reading silently Nemser nervous
and drunk sits across from him

Cherkin reads the last line out loud

CHERKIN

(reading)
“Sheldon could not be reached for
comment but then again neither
could Helen Keller Some heroes
don’t need to comment”

(looks up)
This is really moving Paul
Really

Nemser breathes a sigh of relief

CHERKIN (CONTD)
If I were a woman or a weak man
Id be crying right now But I
havent cried since my wife died
(beat)
And that was just ‘cause I had
something in my eye

NEMSER
Brad I’ve seen you cry dozens of
times You cried at my dad’s
funeral

CHERKIN
Not louder than you
(mocking)
“I’m gonna miss you dad I love
you”
(back to normal)
That was embarrassing

NEMSER
That was not embarrassing

CHERKIN
Well everyone could hear you

NEMSER
It was a eulogy

CHERKIN
(moving on)
Listen I’m gonna put this on the

Cherkin stands at Nemser’s desk jubilant He’s holding a
huge sack of letters Cherkin drops it on the desk

This is the most hate mail we’ve
received since you wrote that piece
about racial inequality

INSERT Front page of The Vanguard It’s grid of headshots of
people of different races The headline reads “What’s the
best race Answer on page 5”

CHERKIN (CONTD)
It’s just fantastic Try to get
some quotes from the kid next time

In the background Savrin sits at his desk watching and
seething with jealousy

NEMSER
You know I think he might be
finished with his counter-protest
I think it was a one-shot deal

CHERKIN
No Unacceptable People are eating
this kid up They hate him We need
more

NEMSER
But if he doesn’t want--
CHERKIN
Then convince him Wring another
article out of this Your dad knew
how to do that I’m sure you can

EXT HUNTINGDON LAB - DAY

Animal rights activists continue to protest outside
Huntingdon Lab The crowd is smaller than the first day but

still substantial -- in the hundreds Tents are set up to one
side -- it’s clear they’re in it for the long haul
PROTESTORS

Meat is murder Fur is murder
Vivisection’s murder

On the opposite side of the field nearer the mall a very
small group of COUNTER-PROTESTORS stand together chanting
Mainly old fusty academic-looking types They’re chanting
Georgie’s chant

COUNTER-PROTESTORS
Meat is delicious Fur is fine
What does vivisection mean

Savrin walks by them glaring at them as he does so He sees
Lydia speaking to a couple Animal Liberation Front leaders
off to the side of the main group of protestors

Lydia sees him coming and walks over

SAVRIN

LYDIA
This is a closed-door meeting
Mark No press

Savrin looks a little hurt

SAVRIN
I’m not coming as press I’m coming
as an animal-lover

She checks her watch

LYDIA
(a little annoyed)
What is it You know your friend
Nemser didn’t do us any favors

She gestures to the small counter-protest

SAVRIN
That’s what I came to talk about
He’s not my friend And he’s gonna
write more articles I think you
should send him a message

INT THE VANGUARD - NEWSROOM - DAY

Nemser sits on the edge of his desk sipping coffee We see
Janie tearing through the office behind him

Janie grabs Nemser by the neck and shoves him against the
wall The coffee mug shatters on the floor

Cecile casually takes out a Polaroid camera and takes a
picture She opens a drawer and puts the photo in it

CLOSE ON The drawer There are dozens of photos of various
people holding Nemser against the same wall and choking him
He’s angered a lot of people in his career

Janie puts her face close to Nemser’s He’s struggling to
escape but can’t

JANIE
(hissing)
How dare you You lied to my son
you put him in danger and for
what I’ve already lost a husband
God help you if--

NEMSER
--Animal rights is a sensitive
issue Just like civil rights
Georgie and I knew it’d be
dangerous to get involved

She slams him against the wall again and pins him tighter

JANIE

(near hysterical)
Get involved Look around you You
havent gotten involved A
journalist trying to get involved
in a movement is like a guy with a
rubber trying to get me pregnant
it can’t happen And the one time
it does happen it got an abortion
Youre protected Nemser You’re
press Georgie isn’t And you put
him in danger just to get some--
some fiction in the paper

NEMSER
On the front page

JANIE
(quiet shocked)
You don’t care about anyone You
have no empathy

NEMSER
I’ve heard that before yeah

CECILE
(polite helpful)
You might want to try slapping his
face really hard

Janie slaps Nemser

NEMSER
I’m sorry

CECILE
(polite helpful)
And again

Janie slaps him again

NEMSER
(sincere)
I’m really sorry I am

He struggles again but he still can’t escape her grasp

Oh Then this is embarrassing

A pimply-faced INTERN runs up to them

Mr Nemser there are some guys
outside attacking your bike I just
called the police

loosens her grasp and Nemser runs over to the window
comes over to look too

are two bikes on a bike rack Three men in ski-masks
around one of them smashing it with baseball bats

NEMSER
Jesus

JANIE
Wait that’s my bike

NEMSER
Oh thank god

Just then one of the three men takes a photograph out of his
pocket looks at it and then points at the other bike The
men move to the other bike and start smashing it

NEMSER (CONT’D)
Damn it

He watches in agony as they totally demolish his bike The
men begin to walk away

JANIE
You know I think mine’s still
rideable

Just then one of the three men sticks his thumb back in the
direction of Janie’s bike The other two shrug (as in “why
not”) They go back and begin smashing her bike again

JANIE (CONT’D)
Damn

NEMSER
Wait look The police are coming

Two mounted police officers gallop over at top speed They
pull up next to the masked men and raise their nightsticks
threateningly

The masked men begin petting the horses hugging them
feeding them sugar cubes they happen to keep in their
pockets and generally loving them

The policemen look at each other shrug and lower their
nightsticks

Nemser and Janie look at each other
Janie looks back at her bike
CLOSE ON Janie’s bike Utterly demolished

(realizes)

I left Georgie alone with these
people

INT TAXI CAB - MOMENTS LATER

Nemser holds Janie’s hand trying to reassure her She’s
barely keeping it together He’s also on edge taking sips
from his flask

NEMSER
(firm)
He’11 be fine He’s resourceful

JANIE
He’s just a kid

NEMSER

He reads John Locke On purpose He
develops complicated computer
programs He is not just a kid
He’s more like-- a strange little
man

Janie looks at him wild-eyed

NEMSER (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I’m not good at
comforting people I’m better at
being comforted It’s just ever
since my wife died

Janie puts her hand on his arm

JANIE
Oh I’m so sorry Your wife died

NEMSER
No no Never married You see I’m
just better at being comforted

Janie cracks a brief smile which was Nemser’s intent He
puts his hand on her hand on his arm trying to calm her

NEMSER (CONTD)
I was close though once Lillian
She was an advertising executive
for Office Depot She really got
inside my head

JANIE
Not a pretty place to be

NEMSER
No It should have police tape
around it She always knew what I
was thinking

(MORE )

NEMSER (CONTD)

She could predict what I was about
to say and yell at me before I said
it It was a very efficient
relationship And I loved her Very
much Like whenever I saw her if
I had a tail it would’ve wagged

(then)
Why am I telling you this It’s not
the time

JANIE
(gently with a smile)
No Please continue It’s really
nice to hear about something bad
that happened to you

Nemser smirks

NEMSER

It’s not too interesting Same old
story She could tell I wasn’t
gonna propose -- too scared to pull
the trigger too much I wanted to
get done first You know I just
wanted a little recognition of my
work Maybe not a Pulitzer Prize
but maybe a George Polk Award or a
Nieman Fellowhip or a Sidney
Hillman or a Loeb or a National
Press-——

(stops himself)
Just some sign from someone that I
was doing something right So while
I waited for that she left me A
few years ago now But at least
when she left she forgot one of her
scrunchies in my apartment so I

(off Janie’s weirded-out

look)
threw it out immediately No reason
to keep that around for years

EXT GEORGIE’S HOUSE - LATER

The cab pulls up in front of the house As Nemser pays Janie
staggers out of the car

Nemser hangs up Janie screams and runs to hug Georgie She
grabs him by the shoulders and shakes him relieved but
angry

JANIE

Hi Ms Lycroft How are you

She’s trembling hysterically She has tears and mucus running
down her face She decides she’s not sure how to answer
Rajiv’s question

She turns back to Georgie

JANIE
I told you not to go anywhere
Georgie

GEORGIE

I know I locked the doors I put
on the chains I’m not stupid mom
There was absolutely no way I was
gonna leave this house for
anything No way

(beat)
But then Rajiv asked if I wanted to
hang out so I was like “yeah
whatever”

NEMSER
(to himself)
Huh Maybe he is just a kid

Georgie notices Nemser for the first time

GEORGIE
(icy)
What are you doing here

JANIE
He came to make sure you were
alright

GEORGIE
(dripping with sarcasm)
Well I’m sorry to break it to you
but I’m fine I’d probably make a
better story if I were dead right

NEMSER
It’s not like that Georgie We’re
a weekly You still have plenty of
time to die

He smiles trying to win Georgie over But his joke is met
with silence and his smile fades

Georgie turns back to Janie

GEORGIE
Anyway I only left after the
protestors had already gone They
all left at once

JANIE
Well they must have come back
while you were gone The kitchen
windows smashed

GEORGIE
Oh yeah sorry about that We were
playing window baseball

I meant it and I was trying to sell
papers And I was drunk And I use
the phrase “Gestapo tactics” in
almost every article I write

INSERT A newspaper clipping Headline reads “7-Eleven Opens
On Derby Ave” Sub-headline reads “No Gestapo Tactics Used”

GEORGIE
Good enough Get in

Georgie climbs into the backseat Rajiv gestures to the
passenger seat

Nemser hesitates

NEMSER
I sit in front

RAJIV
I only have my learner’s permit An
adult needs to sit in front

NEMSER
More people die in the passenger
seat than any other seat It’s
called the “Death Seat”

GEORGIE
Rajiv is a terrible driver These
are all death seats

Nemser nods and gets in the car The car staggers off down
the street

INT ALF MEETING ROOM - LATER

A dark windowless room Lydia presides at the head of a long
narrow table The rest of the seats are taken by various ALF
leaders including Che (who is already ski-masked) Savrin
sits in the seat to Lydia’s right

Lydia’s tosses ski masks around the table as she talks As
people catch them they put them on
LYDIA
Let’s be quick and stick together
And what’s the most important
thing

ALL
(in semi-unison)
Have fun out there

LYDIA
(shaking her head “no”
Don’t get caught And if you do get
caught what do you do Bryson
what do you do

BRYSON a very fat activist pipes up

BRYSON
Try to kill myself
LYDIA
Right The rest of you what do you

do

ALL EXCEPT BRYSON
(in unison)
Try to run away

Lydia nods

LYDIA
And if you can’t escape call a
lawyer But do not mention the
Animal Liberation Front You’re on
your own at that point

She’s handed out all the ski-masks except two hers and
Savrin’s She turns to Savrin

LYDIA (CONT’D)
You sure you’re ready

Savrin snatches a mask from her

SAVRIN
Does a bear shit in the woods

LYDIA
(very serious)
Actually many bears are losing
their traditional woodland shitting-
grounds

Awkward beat Savrin aggressively pulls on the ski-mask

SAVRIN
Well I’m ready

Lydia pulls on her mask last

EXT HUNTINGDON LAB - NIGHT

Nemser and Georgie stand on the sidewalk as Rajiv’s car
screeches away They’re at the back of the lab The chanting
and ruckus going on at the front of the lab is just audible
in the background

Nemser nods at Georgie and they walk quietly towards the
building

Suddenly a few animal rights PROTESTORS walk by and see
Nemser and Georgie skulking around in the dark The
protestors look at them suspiciously

Nemser thinks fast He starts marching

NEMSER
(chanting)
Everything is wrong Don’t do
anything

Georgie joins in marching behind him

NEMSER AND GEORGIE
(chanting)
Everything is wrong Don’t do
anything

One of the protestors turns to the others

PROTESTOR 1
It’s just some of those anti-
everything protestors

PROTESTOR 2
Those guys are fanatical But they
do such good work

The protestors continue on and turn the corner Nemser and
Georgie stop chanting and breathe a sigh of relief

They reach a chain-link fence surrounding the lab The gate’s
locked There’s barbed-wire along the top of the fence

Nemser looks discouraged but Georgie casually takes off his
jacket and swings it over the barbed wire covering it

GEORGIE
Go ahead
NEMSER
(impressed)

Where’d you learn that

Georgie shrugs

GEORGIE

My dad showed me when I was a kid
The last thing he ever said to me
just before he went to Oregon was

(imitating his father)
“Georgie if it doesn’t have barbed
wire around it it’s not worth
breaking into”

NEMSER
(suspicious)
What do you mean before he went to
Oregon

Beat

GEORGIE
(stammers )
Before he died I mean It’s a
saying Like
(for example)
“Oh no I have all this cancer I
think I’m going to Oregon”

Georgie quickly climbs over Nemser watches him a touch
bewildered and then climbs over himself

They creep up to a back door of the lab

Nemser knocks Almost immediately a MAN inside barks in
reply

MAN (0S)
Disperse I’m telephoning the
police

NEMSER

We’re not protestors Ima
journalist with The Vanguard Paul
Nemser I’m here with Georgie
Sheldon

They see an eye go the peep-hole

MAN (0S)
The Georgie Sheldon

Nemser and Georgie look at each other surprised Nemser
nudges Georgie

GEORGIE
Uh yeah the Georgie Sheldon

The door swings open The man is PETER BERGSTROM the elderly
and dignified head scientist whose photo Lydia had held up at
the rally His portrait would look right at home next to

Isaac Newtons

Bergstrom ushers them inside and quickly closes the door

INT HUNTINGDON LAB - CONTINUOUS

It’s a cluttered well-worn laboratory -- the lab from the
hidden camera footage

There are mice rats rabbits pigs dogs and primates all
in spacious cages There are also microscopes and plenty of
high-tech machines -- the kind of complicated machines that
no one knows what they’re called or what they do but which
seem appropriate for a lab

Several SCIENTISTS run around frantically packing things
into boxes

Bergstrom beholds Georgie and then hugs him tightly

BERGSTROM
Thank you Thank you thank you

Georgie glances at Nemser who shrugs

GEORGIE
I didn’t do anything

BERGSTROM

(to Georgie)
Yes you have Your movement We
all read about it It’s small
perhaps but it means the world to
us if even a few people understand
what we’re doing That we’re not
sheer evil

(chokes up)
Thank you for your courage

(to Nemser )
And you’re Paul Nemser
Nemser nods proudly Bergstrom shakes his hand

BERGSTROM (CONTD)
Thank you Thank you so much If
not for your article I never would
have known about that new 7-Eleven
on Derby They have impressively
large sodas Thank you for your
courage

NEMSER
(embarrassed)
I also-- I wrote the article about
Georgie

BERGSTROM
Ah Wonderful

Bergstrom sweeps his hand across the scene

BERGSTROM (CONTD)
Well here it is Our
“concentration camp” as they call
it It’s just a normal lab as you
can see Or rather it was just a
normal lab

GEORGIE
What do you mean “was”

BERGSTROM

Did you not see the rally today
They threatened us Can you believe
it Such violent tactics

(nostalgic)
Whatever happened to the days when
people protested by committing
suicide Like that monk who set
himself on fire during the Vietnam
War What a wonderful way to
protest

NEMSER
You’re closing the lab

BERGSTROM
We must

GEORGIE
(crestfallen)
You’re giving in to them

INT HUNTINGDON LAB - LATER

Bergstrom takes Georgie and Nemser on a tour through the lab
Everywhere they go scientists and ASSISTANTS are packing
things into boxes preparing to leave

BERGSTROM

(walking and talking)
Here we were developing a drug to
treat Alzheimer’sThis was a rat
experiment for a novel Parkinson’s
treatmentThis was a
comprehensive monkey trial of a new
multiple sclerosis vaccine

He opens a cage and a MONKEY grabs hold of him

BERGSTROM (CONTD)
And this little fellow is named Mr
Gibbs He’s been with us for nearly
a decade and he’s one of our
favorite pals around here He and I
have become very very close

(to the monkey)

Say hi Mr Gibbs

An ASSISTANT looks up from his desk a few feet away

ASSISTANT
Mr Gibbs died during an experiment
yesterday That’s Boris

Bergstrom doesn’t bat an eye

BERGSTROM
Say hi Boris

ASSISTANT
Wait Boris died this morning
That’s Specimen 947XK

BERGSTROM
Say hi Specimen 947XK You know
weve just met but I think you and
I have become very very close

Bergstrom puts the monkey back in its cage

GEORGIE
(a little angry)
How many animals have you killed
here

BERGSTROM
We don’t like to use the term
“killed” That word makes it sound
like it’s somehow intentional or
purposeful

A passing RESEARCHER comes up to Bergstrom and shows him some
data on a clipboard

RESEARCHER 1
We finished the Parkinson’s trial
About one-third of the rats were
oopsy-daisied

BERGSTROM
(glancing at the data)
Good Wrap it up

The researcher moves on
Nemser puts his hand on Georgie’s shoulder

NEMSER
We knew this stuff happened
Georgie

Georgie shrugs Nemser’s hand off his shoulder
Bergstrom begins begin walking again

BERGSTROM
It’s a sacrifice we have to make if
we want to develop these drugs You
know even Lydia said -- the one
reasonable thing she said is that
it’s a difficult philosophical
question whether or not it’s worth
it

They walk into

INT HUNTINGDON LAB - BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

ALICE KIM and PANOS PETRAKOS -- whose pictures Lydia held up
at the rally -- stand and sip coffee There’s a little card
table and a refrigerator

BERGSTROM
I happen to think it is worth it
She doesn’t But it’s open for
debate
(then)
(MORE )

BERGSTROM (CONTD)
By the way this is Alice and
Panos They were my lead
researchers

Everyone shakes hands except Georgie who’s still trying to
work this out

GEORGIE
I mean if it’s open for debate--

BERGSTROM
(suddenly indignant)
But I respect their beliefs They
don’t respect mine They’re
bullies Georgie Have you ever
tried reasoning with a bully
EXT STREETS - FLASHBACK

Georgie lies on the sidewalk Travis bully extraordinaire
sits on his chest

A handful of STUDENTS watch and snicker

GEORGIE
I can’t breathe

Travis gets up

TRAVIS

Georgie coughs and starts sitting up

GEORGIE
Yes thank y--

Travis sits back down on his chest

TRAVIS

GEORGIE
(sighs)
Yes

INT HUNTINGDON LAB - BREAK ROOM - PRESENT

GEORGIE
I understand

NEMSER
You know what If you got them to
debate you’d destroy them Make it
a public thing Georgie could raise
a ruckus get people to turn out--

GEORGIE
(smarmy )
--You’d get a great article out of
it

NEMSER
But that’s what we need Press
It’s all about massaging the
message and getting it on the front
page That’s how public opinion
works Take the Titanic That was
really really sad right Not at
first

INSERT Front page of old-timey newspaper Big photo of the
Titanic sinking with the headline “COOL”

NEMSER (CONT’D)
Then the survivors got a publicist
worked the press a bit and now we
mourn it as a national tragedy We
gotta take hold of this thing Work
the press ourselves You should
challenge them to a debate or
something

Bergstrom shakes his head

BERGSTROM
We mustn’t We’re not capable
communicators Alice for example
constantly makes terrible science
jokes that only she seems to get

ALICE

(jokey)
That hypothesis is not falsifiable

Alice laughs uproariously Everyone else is silent

He puts his hands to his temple closes his eyes and rocks
intensely back and forth

BERGSTROM (CONT’D)
Oh no Oh no Oh no Oh no

Panos gestures (like “I got it”) and leaves the room As
soon as he does so Bergstrom instantly returns to normal

BERGSTROM (CONT’D)
That’s the concern

NEMSER
Leave the communicating to us I
communicate for a living And
Georgie here--
Nemser lifts up Georgie’s t-shirt

NEMSER (CONTD)
We can write stuff on his stomach

BERGSTROM
But they wish to harm us

Nemser gestures across Georgie’s stomach

NEMSER
Like “Dr Bergstrom”

BERGSTROM
It’s not so simple--

NEMSER
“Rocks”

BERGSTROM

(suddenly excited)
Yes Yes Then everyone will know

There’s a loud BANG

SHOUTING and SCREAMING

Everyone rushes into

INT HUNTINDGON LAB - HALLWAY

Nearly a dozen ALF ACTIVISTS in ski masks wearing backpacks
have broken down a door and invaded the lab

All the researchers cower together against the wall Nemser
Georgie and Bergstrom are huddled in the back of the group

The activists stand facing the researchers

They open their backpacks Some of them take out BIG CANVAS
BAGS Others take out LARGE GUNS

RESEARCHER 2
Oh my god they have bags

Assorted shrieking

RESEARCHER 3
Take anything you want just don’t
hurt us

RESEARCHER 2
Kill everyone except me

Che holding a pistol and Lydia step forward

LYDIA
Shut up

Lydia takes out a small boombox puts it on the floor and
presses play It plays “Blackbird” by The Beatles

LYDIA (CONTD)
(to activists)
Alright go liberate them

The activists holding bags scatter They open cages and lift
the animals into their sacks

Others pick up computers and smash them on the ground All to
the gentle strumming of “Blackbird”

The gun-toting activists keep their weapons trained on the
researchers

CHE
Where’s the head of this gulag
Peter Bergstrom

Bergstrom huddled in back with Nemser and Georgie sighs and
hangs his head

Beat

(whispers to Nemser)
Please Paul I want you to do
something for me

towards Lydia and Che

(continuing)
Two sedate using isoflurane
Three hug the rat very lovingly
Four decapitate the rat using--

LYDIA
--Shut up

BERGSTROM
(thoughtfully)
You know I just realized the
hugging steps are probably
unnecessary

LYDIA

(angry)
I had to do what I had to do
Bergstrom Every moment I was in
your little den here I wanted to
tear off my own skin I felt so
disgusting But you gotta break a
few eggs Even Paul McCartney had
to wear leather when he was young
so he could become a rich and
famous rock star and then use that
influence to help the animal rights
movement And even though he wore
leather no one can claim that he’s
anything less than a perfect human
being

(to Che)
Alright Do it

CHE
On your knees

Bergstrom slowly drops to his knees

GEORGIE
(whispers )
We have to do something

NEMSER
(whispers )
Don’t get involved

Georgie throws him a look and then quickly squeezes through
the crowd

GEORGIE
(shouting at Che)
You’re gonna hurt an old man
(MORE )

GEORGIE (CONTD)
Why don’t you pick on someone your
own size

Everyone including Che immediately turns to look at an
EXTREMELY TALL AND EXTREMELY THIN RESEARCHER who is exactly
as tall and thin as Che They look like identical twins

The tall thin researcher frantically waves his arms to
indicate “no”

GEORGIE (CONTD)
Not him

LYDIA
(noticing)
Wait a second You’re little
Georgie Sheldon aren’t you

She turns to the other activists

LYDIA (CONTD)
It’s the little boy who started
that great big movement

They snicker

GEORGIE

It’s that woman with awesome
breasts who started that terrorist
group

(then)
That just slipped out But
actually now that I mention it
it’s really a shame that someone so
evil and heartless has such great
breasts while a smart kind
dedicated woman like Dr Kim

He trails off realizing he should stop Everyone looks at
Alice Kim who is FLAT-CHESTED She looks embarrassed

LYDIA
Quite the orator aren’t you

GEORGIE
Look why are you terrorizing these
people Do you even understand what
they’re trying to do They’re
trying to help people What if you
had Parkinson’s You’d want help
It’s a horrible disease to shake
uncontrollably like that

(MORE )
GEORGIE (CONTD)

And the few times you actually want
to shake you don’t get credit
“Oh that’s just the Parkinson’s”

(gestures to the

researchers)
You make these people out to be
monsters but they’re not They’re
just normal people

RESEARCHER 1
Some of us are autistic

GEORGIE
OK yeah but they’re all human
They all experience human emotions
just like everyone else

RESEARCHER 3
I unfortunately do not experience
human emotions

Georgie sighs and then steels himself

GEORGIE
(firm)
Just leave the animals and go

Lydia approaches Georgie menacingly

BERGSTROM
(whispers to Georgie)
Don’t do this son You have your
whole life ahead of you

GEORGIE
No
(gestures to researchers)
Either all of us walk out of here
or none of us do

RESEARCHER 2
Yeah Or just one of us does

Researcher 2 gestures to himself and mouths “Me Me”

Isn’t he just the most adorable
thing you’ve ever seen

She pinches Georgie’s cheek

LYDIA (CONTD)
(baby voice)
Aren’t you Georgie Porgie

CHE
(baby voice)
Does Georgie Porgie want to play
Ghandi Does Georgie Porgie have a
dream

In back of the huddle of researchers Nemser writes furiously
on his notepad

GEORGIE (0S)
Nemser I can’t breathe Help me
Nemser

The crowd parts around Nemser but he’s too busy writing to
notice

Georgie is lying on the ground Lydia is sitting on his
chest exactly as Travis once did

The other activists snicker

Georgie can now see Nemser taking notes but Nemser doesn’t
realize it

NEMSER
(to himself as he writes)
“Help me Nemser Help me Nemser”
Mr Sheldon cried bravely But
there was no help to be found

He looks up from his pad to see Georgie staring at him sadly
Lydia grabs Georgie’s arms and uses them to hit himself
LYDIA
Why are you hitting yourself Why
are you hitting yourself
CHE
(squealing with delight)

It’s because he’s so dumb

The activists laugh at Georgie Even some of the scientists
join in

Nemser gulps hard takes a swig from his flask and staggers
towards them

NEMSER
Hey Stop

Lydia doesn’t stop

NEMSER (CONTD)
Let him go

She still ignores him

NEMSER (CONT’D)
UhLennon was better than
McCartney

Everything SCREECHES to a halt Lydia looks at Nemser murder
in her eyes She remains seated on Georgie

That is the stupidest thing I have
ever heard What did John Lennon
ever do for animal rights

NEMSER
Well he was killed before it
became--

LYDIA

Nothing is what And his lyrics
were crap “Imagine all the people
living for today” What does that
even mean

NEMSER
It’s no worse than “Ob-La-Di Ob-La-
Da”
LYDIA
(frantic)
I’m gonna kill him I’m gonna shoot
his head

Lydia raises her gun Nemser puts his hands in front of his
face

NEMSER
No I’m just as a journalist
Remember me I’m just doing a
story That’s all Not helping
these people Let me actually -- uh
-- double-check a quote with you

He flips open his notepad

NEMSER (CONTD)
(pretend reading)
“Why are you hitting yourself Why
are you hitting yourself”

Lydia lowers her gun

LYDIA
That’s correct And here’s another
quote for you “Georgie Porgie
fights like a dainty little
schoolgirl”

Everyone laughs Nemser scribbles nervously

NEMSER

(as he writes)
“Daintylittleschoolgirl” Got

(shaking his head)
Ive heard that before Paul From
you

(then)
I hear in Boca there are chairs so
sturdy that you can sit in them for
hours just gazing into space
trying to remember your wife’s
name

Bergstrom picks up his briefcases and shuffles off

BERGSTROM (CONT’D)
Take care Paul

Nemser wanders over to the lab
He shakes the locked gate
He notices a SIGN

“NOTICE OF DEMOLITION THIS BUILDING IS SCHEDULED TO BE
DEMOLISHED ON MAY 5”

Nemser is taken aback He checks his watch

May 2

Nemser looks at Bergstrom in the distance sadly walking
away

INT THE VANGUARD - NEWSROOM - LATE AT NIGHT

Nemser’s alone in the newsroom A light is still on in
Cherkin’s office

CLOSE ON Nemser’s computer screen He’s on Googlecom
He begins typing in the search box William Sheld--

CHERKIN (0S)
What are you doing

Nemser looks up Cherkin is walking toward him coming around
to his side of his desk to check out what Nemser’s working

on

Nemser frantically deletes what he’s typed in the search box
and in its place types “Asian butts”

NEMSER
Oh just browsing for porn

Cherkin nods
CHERKIN
Keep up the good work You might
want to try searching the word
“breasts” That often turns out
very well for me

NEMSER
Will do Brad

Cherkin nods puts on his coat and leaves the newsroom
Nemser erases “Asian butts” and types in “William Sheldon AND
Oregon” He presses “search”

INT HIGH SCHOOL - MATH CLASSROOM - DAY

A different packed classroom Georgie and Rajiv sit at
adjacent tables in the pack

Travis and Max the bullies sit in the front row

The math teacher MR BOYD sits on the edge of his desk
He’s one of those unfortunate teachers who still wants to be
hip and popular

There’s an equation written on the chalkboard

DDX TAN (X) DDX SIN(X)COS(X)

A sea of blank faces

BOYD

(trying to be hip)
Come on dudes and dames we can
figure this out Look most
teachers wanna make math all
abstract and boring But I’m not
most teachers

(gestures to the board)
This problem is about your everyday
lives partying and chilling out

Georgie rolls his eyes

GEORGIE
(sarcastic)
It is
BOYD

Well maybe not your life nerd
Mr Boyd high-fives Travis and Max
BOYD (CONTD)
Look dudes let’s imagine “ddx”
is beer “sine” is pot and
“cosine” is sex

Travis raises his hand excitedly

TRAVIS
The answer is secant squared of x

BOYD
Bravo bro

Mr Boyd high-fives Travis again
Georgie gathers his stuff
GEORGIE
(whispers to Rajiv)

I can’t do this

He grabs his stuff and walks out of the classroom Travis and
Max murmur to each other

He walks into

INT HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY
Nemser stands outside the classroom waiting for him

They stare at each other

NEMSER
They’re gonna demolish the lab

GEORGIE
(icy quiet)
So

NEMSER
Bergstrom’s moving to a retirement
community

GEORGIE
And

NEMSER
And I thought we could try to do
something about it

GEORGIE
(blows up)
Do something about it We were
doing something about it Why do
you think we went to the fucking
lab To write an article

NEMSER
To prepare to do something about
it

GEORGIE

Your whole life is preparing
Nemser Always preparing never
doing My dad had a saying about
people like you--

NEMSER
--You’re giving me advice from a
junkie

GEORGIE
(angry) a
He wasn’t just a junkie He was a
really smart guy

NEMSER
I’m sorry You’re right I’m sorry
What was his saying

GEORGIE
“You can’t just put the heroin in
the needle You gotta put the
needle in the arm”

NEMSER
Uh huh You know Georgie
sometimes it’s not so easy

GEORGIE
Well he had a saying “Can’t put
it in the arm Put it in the neck”

Georgie turns and starts walking away Nemser runs up puts
an arm on his shoulder and spins him around

NEMSER
Georgie They had guns What did
you want me to do

GEORGIE
I wanted you to kick or punch or
yell or run I don’t know I
wanted you to do something

Georgie walks away

Nemser pulls a sheet of paper out of his pocket and holds it
towards Georgie

NEMSER
What is this

Georgie annoyed turns back to look
He stares at the paper but says nothing His eyes glisten

CLOSE ON The paper It’s a printout of a newspaper article
The headline reads “Activist Chains Himself To Douglas Fir”
There’s a photo of William Sheldon (wearing his aviator
sunglasses) chained to a tree

Nemser begins to read the article

NEMSER (CONT’D)

(reading)
William Sheldon a longtime social
and environmental activist
traveled to Oregon on Saturday to
protect a Douglas Fir from a
scheduled logging operation
Sheldon pledged to remain chained
to the tree for as long as it takes
to save it

Nemser looks up and shakes the page

NEMSER (CONTD)
This is from 2001
GEORGIE
(murmurs )
It can take forever to save
something

Nemser scans down to the middle of the article

NEMSER
(reading)
“Were all part of the same earthly
organism” Sheldon said “I have as

much of an obligation to this fir
tree as I do to my own son A son
is a tree is a bush is a wife”

GEORGIE

(explodes )
Are you just trying to hurt me I
know all this What’s my mom
supposed to tell people “Oh my
husband -- the father of my son --
abandoned us to go save some tree
somewhere” Do you know how
shameful that is So we made up
some respectable lie -- he died of
a drug overdose And he did do a
lot of drugs Everything about him
was selfish

NEMSER
(gently)
Look I know what it’s like to have
a selfish father My dad won the
Pulitzer Prize

Beat

GEORGIE
And then he abandoned you

NEMSER
No he loved us very much He used
the prize money to buy me toys

Georgie looks at him bug-eyed

NEMSER (CONTD)
But do you have any idea how
miserable it is to live with that
over your head To be the son of
someone who really helped people
and made a difference

Georgie shakes his head in disbelief and walks away

GEORGIE
You have a strange definition of
selfishness
NEMSER
(shouting after him)
Well so do you
Nemser deflated watches him go He walks away in the other
direction
EXT HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

Nemser walks out the front door

As he shuffles down the sidewalk in front of the school he
happens to glance at one of the first floor windows

INSIDE in the hallway Travis and Max have pressed Georgie
against the lockers and are mocking him as usual

From Nemser’s perspective we ZOOM IN on Georgie

Georgie is totally defeated He doesn’t struggle He doesn’t
kick punch yell or run He doesn’t do anything

Nemser watches He looks angry

Lydia goes over to the dog and rubs his tummy

LYDIA (CONTD)

INT SAFE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Lydia and Mark walk out of the bedroom

The small house is completely packed with the animals taken
from Huntingdon Lab Cats dogs rats rabbits and monkeys
roam free It looks and smells like a Zoo

A few activists hang out playing cards and keeping an eye on
the animals

LYDIA
(beams )
Can you believe they kept these
majestic animals locked up

ACTIVIST

(without looking up from

his cards)
One of the monkeys took a shit and
threw it at another monkey and
then that monkey took a shit and
threw it back at the first monkey
and then all the monkeys starting
throwing their shit at each other
and eating the shit

Lydia puts her arm around Savrin’s waist and gazes at the
animals

LYDIA
Freedom is a wonderful thing

Savrin seems unconvinced So do the other activists

EXT HUNTINGDON LAB - NIGHT

Nemser removes some chains from his duffel bag and walks a
few steps to the lab’s front gate

He HANDCUFFS himself arms out Jesus-like to the gate

He stands upright triumphant

EXT HUNTINGDON LAB - NIGHT
Nemser slumps against his chains bored

He looks down and notices his flask in his pocket He can’t
get to it

He sees a BUM pushing a shopping cart along the sidewalk

NEMSER
Hey I got a business opportunity
for you

BUM
(calling)
You got cans

NEMSER
I got a dollar for you

BUM

BUM
Money first

NEMSER
My wallet’s in the other pocket

The bum fishes out Nemser’s wallet He opens it There’s a
single 100 dollar bill

NEMSER (CONT’D)
So just go ahead and take that and
put in 99 dollars change

The bum looks at him He pockets the 100 and begins walking
away

NEMSER (CONT’D)
Hey Hey

The bum comes back takes Nemser’s flask and walks away
again

NEMSER (CONT’D)
Hey Well now I see why you’re
homeless you’re not nice Nice

“Tt all started back when
(back to normal)
It’s a little weird but I’ve
gotten used to it I’ve actually

NEMSER
You’ve known me for 30 seconds

lifetimes It starts to add up

An OUTDOORSY-GUY a Nalgene water bottle hanging off a
carabiner on his belt comes up to them holding a tent bag

EXT HUNTINGDON LAB - EVENING

The crowd in the field has continued to grow It’s a motley
crew of hippies teens camping enthusiasts etc They’re all
having a good time

Nemser stands alone at the gate He’s dirty and unkempt but
determined

A figure comes up to him out of the darkness

It’s Janie but she looks utterly different she’s shed her
corporate black pantsuit and put on her old activist garb

She’s wearing black leather and a black bandana covers her

mouth

She pulls her bandana down around her neck

NEMSER
Janie

JANIE
I brought you something

She holds up a bowl and spoon

NEMSER
Whiskey in a bowl
(very moved)
Thank you so much Janie

JANIE
It’s soup

NEMSER
(disappointed)
Oh Thank you

Nemser opens his mouth and Janie begins ladling the soup into
it tenderly

NEMSER (CONT’D)
re her clothes)
Looking good

JANIE
laughs)
I haven’t worn this stuff in years

NEMSER
smiles mouth full)
Still fits

JANIE
(re his chains)
So I guess Georgie told you about
his dad

NEMSER
I did some research

Janie nods A dramatic beat

NEMSER (CONT’D)
(gently)
Look-- there’s no accounting for
priorities Everyone has a
different list

JANIE
(anger bubbles up)

No Not when you have a wife and
kid If you have a wife and kid it
goes one kid two wife Then
three four five six can be whatever
the hell you want -- trees whales
the goddamn manatees -- go nuts
But one and two

She trails off upset Nemser ponders briefly and then nods

NEMSER
You’re right You’re right

Another beat Nemser smiles

NEMSER (CONT’D)
If it’s any consolation he’s been
chained to a tree for seven years

Janie laughs and then suddenly -- to Nemser’s surprise --
hugs him He strains against his chains to reciprocate the
hug but can’t He settles for gently tapping the back of her
leg with one of his heels

NEMSER (CONTD)
On the other hand I hear the
Pacific Northwest is beautiful this
time of year

Janie laughs into his chest

JANIE
Shut up

Nemser spots Georgie emerging from the protestors He’s
wearing AVIATOR SUNGLASSES like his dad

NEMSER
(whispers to Janie)
It’s Georgie

Janie releases her grasp and turns around She beams She
didn’t expect him to come

GEORGIE
Hi

Nemser smiles

NEMSER
Thanks for coming

GEORGIE
Yeah

They stare at each other awkwardly for a beat

To diffuse the tension Georgie awkwardly high-fives one
Nemser’s chained-up hands

Bergstrom approaches the trio

NEMSER
Dr Bergstrom I thought you were
going to Florida

BERGSTROM
I was but when I saw you on the
news I turned to my wife and said
“What’s your name wife” And she
said “It’s Clara” And I said
“Clara I need to go speak to him”

He sighs

BERGSTROM (CONTD)
It’s too expensive to replace the
animals Paul And without them we
have no choice but to proceed with
the demolition tomorrow

GEORGIE
Well then we’ve got tonight

BERGSTROM
(breaks into off-key song)
Who needs tomorrow Weve got
tonight babe Why dont you stay

of
NEMSER
You can remember Bob Seger lyrics
but you can’t remember your wife’s
name

BERGSTROM
I am not proud of it

Janie claps once loud to get their attention

JANIE
Focus So if we get the animals
back tonight that’s enough You
keep the lab

Bergstrom shakes his head

BERGSTROM
Dayenu It would be enough But
there’s no way They bring the
animals to a safe house and guard
them heavily

GEORGIE
Alright hold on

Georgie climbs into the gate and address the crowd

GEORGIE (CONT’D)
Hello Everyone listen up

The crowd HUSHES

GEORGIE (CONTD)
We’ve just learned that the
demolition will go forward as
planned tomorrow unless--

The crowd begins murmuring and shouting

Why is he so boring What does this
have to with protesting Fewer
words more swear words

Georgie comes over to Nemser Nemser whispers in his
Georgie nods and climbs back onto the gate

ear

GEORGIE
Who here wants to fucking protest
The crowd screams in affirmation
Janie beams at him She leans in towards Nemser
JANIE
(whispers proudly)
He looks like his dad

He does in fact He’s a spitting image of his father from
the black and white photograph

The protestors mill around happily Two of them high-five

PROTESTOR 1
That’s how you fucking protest

PROTESTOR 2
We made a difference Shit yeah

Georgie Nemser and Janie look proud but worried Bergstrom
stands with them

GEORGIE
Is it enough

BERGSTROM
I don’t know These are not our
typical test animals The dogs in
sweaters -- we’d almost certainly
have to remove their sweaters

He takes Georgie’s hand and Nemser’s chained-up hand

BERGSTROM (CONTD)
But thank you for trying

A truck screeches up to them Several ski-masked activists
jump out

GEORGIE
Oh god

Che runs around to the back of the truck and opens the door
All the “liberated” animals pour out of it

Bryson walks up to Nemser

BRYSON

Here Take ‘em I love animals but
they’re disgusting And they’re not
even embarrassed about it They’1l
shit on the ground and then they’11
look right at you like

(tough guy accent)
“Yeah what of it”

BERGSTROM
Thank you sir

Che calls from the background

CHE
Let’s get out of here

Bryson signals “one second”

BRYSON

(conspiratorial)
I don’t like what you do but you
just can’t reason with a woman who
values a dog more than a person
It’s fine for her to feed all our
pizza to the dogs but eat just a
tiny bit of dog food because you’re
a little curious and she’s all

(imitating)
“Bryson that’s gross”

(back to normal)
She’s a lunatic

He runs back to the truck jumps in and the truck peels
away

NEMSER
There they are

Bergstrom and Georgie follow Nemser’s gaze across the field

A line of bulldozers has arrived They hum towards the lab
each manned by a CONSTRUCTION WORKER

The first bulldozer in the line stops 30 feet from Nemser

CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Uh sir I think you accidentally
chained yourself to the thing we
need to demolish

A car speeds onto the field and screeches to a halt near
Nemser Lydia and Savrin gets out She looks crazed He looks
embarrassed

NEMSER
(to himself shocked)
Savrin

LYDIA
(shouting)
OK go Knock it down Let’s go

Bergstrom steps into the middle of the fray

BERGSTROM
(triumphant)
Wait We have our animals We can
keep the lab

The crowd cheers
The construction worker shrugs
Lydia jumps on her car and addresses the crowd

LYDIA

Listen I know you’re angry That’s
why you’re here There’s no better
feeling in the world than being
part of an angry mob But you have
to ask yourself who are you angry
at Are you angry at people who
torture and kill innocent animals

The crowd screams as one

CROWD
YEAH

Georgie jumps up on the gate and addresses the crowd

GEORGIE
Or are you angry at terrorists who
bully and scare us into doing
whatever they want

CROWD
YEAH

Lydia and Georgie glare at each other
Then Lydia smiles She has a trump card

LYDIA
Or

She opens up her jacket and pulls out a TINY ADORABLE PUPPY
that she’d kept hidden there

She holds up the puppy
LYDIA (CONTD)
-do you agree with this puppy
who doesn’t like being tortured and
tested on

The crowd screams louder than ever

CROWD
YEAH I agree with the puppy

LYDIA
The puppy wants you to knock down
the gate

CROWD
OK

The crowd advances on Nemser menacingly

The construction worker starts up the bulldozer and begins
driving towards Nemser

GEORGIE
Wait

The mob stops and turns to look at him He swallows hard

GEORGIE (CONTD)
My father had a saying don’t bite
the hand that feeds you drugs But
that’s exactly what you’re doing
Dr Bergstrom is trying to help
you He wants to help you live
longer lives free from pain and
disease

The crowd murmurs

GEORGIE (CONT’D)
You know there are many kinds of
activism

(MORE )

GEORGIE (CONT’D)

If you’re trying to save a rat or a
tree you can count me out But
some things are worth saving
because they mean something to
people you care about

(points to Lydia)
She’s not into saving anything --
she’s all about destruction and
she’1ll bully you and scare you
until she gets her way But you
dont have to listen to her You
can think for yourselves

The crowd shrugs They’re confused
Lydia holds up the puppy again

LYDIA
The puppy says destroy the lab

The crowd screams in agreement and begins advancing on Nemser
again

Georgie looks panicked
Janie yells to him

JANIE
Georgie

She points to a TINY ADORABLE KITTEN sitting amidst the
animals

JANIE (CONTD)
Use the kitten

Georgie jumps off the gate scoops up the kitten and jumps
back on the gate

The angry mob and the bulldozer are now just feet from
Nemser

GEORGIE
This kitten says save the lab

Beat The crowd is silent
Tense
Then

A CROWDMEMBER
That kitten is cuter than that

puppy

The mob screams in agreement Nemser breathes a sigh of
relief
Lydia looks horrified

The crowd goes over to the first construction worker pulls
him out of the bulldozer and begins beating him up

NEMSER
(calls to Georgie)
Thanks for doing something

Georgie smiles at him

JANIE
Look out

Nemser and Georgie turn to look

Lydia has climbed into the bulldozer and is driving it
directly at Nemser a maniacal look on her face

Georgie thinks fast He TOSSES the kitten in front of the
bulldozer

IN SLOW-MOTION the kitten flies through the air
The kitten lands between the bulldozer and Nemser
CLOSE ON The kitten’s adorable face

KITTEN
Meow

Lydia screams and pulls the emergency break The bulldozer
screeches to a halt just inches from the kitten

Lydia jumps out of the bulldozer falls to her knees and
showers the kitten with kisses and tears

COP CARS sirens wailing pull onto the grass and surround
Lydia

specialty put a bag of ramen on
the table and tell us to cook it

GEORGIE
Great

TRAVIS (0S)
Georgie Porgie

MAX (0S)
Hey there Georgie Porgie

Georgie and Nemser sigh and turn around

TRAVIS
Hmm So is it “Honor Thy Mother
and That Dude”

NEMSER
(sotto to Georgie)
Enough’s enough

Nemser approaches Travis threateningly

NEMSER (CONT’D)
Listen I understand that you wanna
get your kicks in now because it’s
gonna be tough for you to kick ass
with your left hand while pumping
gas with your right hand But if
you ever -- ever talk down to
Georgie again I’m gonna stick
(gestures to Max)
(MORE )

NEMSER (CONT’D)
his head up
(gestures to Travis)
your ass And maybe that sounds
pleasant to you but look at the
size of his head It will not be
pleasant

Beat Travis and Max look at each other

EXT STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

Nemser and Georgie are lying on the street side-by-side
Travis is sitting on Nemser’s chest and Max is sitting on
Georgie’s chest

Nemser turns his head to look at Georgie

NEMSER
It’s nice to do this together

GEORGIE
I can’t breathe

NEMSER
Me neither

FADE OUT
