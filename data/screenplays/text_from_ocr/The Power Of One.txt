THE POWER OF ONE

What if the power of one becomes the
power of many and the power of many
becomes the power of one

FADE IN

1 EXT SOUTH AFRICAN FARM - DAY A white car sits in the yard of the farmhouse On the
door a decal CAPETOWN SANITORIUM Two men dressed
in the white uniforms of the sanitorium exit the farm-
house one gently guiding a rather frail troubled
woman toward the car the other totes her suitcase

The VO of a young man narrates

YOUNG MAN (VO)
There comes a time in everyones
life when they discover that the
only person you can truly depend
on is yourself That the only
real power anyone has to get
anything done is the power of one
With any luck you can make it
through a lot of years before you
ever have to face the reality of
that fact
(beat)
It was a luxury I never had I
discovered it the year my mother
had her nervous breakdown

One attendant holds the rear door of the car open for

the woman Before entering

toward the farmhouse

HER POV

A young BOY looking one part scared
one part lost stares back at her

she turns one last time

one part sad
his hand held by a

and

large amiable black woman with tears rolling down her
round cheeks

YOUNG MAN (VO)
I was all of six

BACK TO SCENE

The woman enters the car

The car drives off down the

road The Boy watches it disappear behind a plume of
swirling dust

The dust the Boy has been watching reverses itself

YOUNG MAN (V0O)
My father died before I was born
and even though I was raised by
my Zulu nanny with my mother
depending on her health in
nominal attendance it was
decided with her departure that
I too would depart
(beat)
for boarding school

An unseen vehicle comes up the road

YOUNG MAN (V0O)
But before I could be sent out
into the world one very serious
matter had to be dealt with

(beat)

I was a chronic bedwetter Since
my nanny was the one responsible
for my well-being she did what
any responsible Zulu mother would
do She called on the greatest
medicine man of her tribe --
Inkosi Inkosikazi
Out of the dust a large black Buick ROADMASTER ROARS up
the road and into the yard scattering chickens and
geese stopping in front of the wide-eyed six-year-old
and his tremulous nanny A huge Zulu jumps out of the
front passenger seat and opens the rear door A moment
passes and then two splayed cracked feet descend from
the car and settle into the dust INKOSI INKOSIKAZI
100 years old small black wizened hair and beard
whiter than cotton a leopard skin draped over his
shoulders a beaded fly switch in one hand a trussed
chicken in the other exits the car

cut To

EXT YARD - NIGHT 4

A fire burns bright in the black African night The Boy
sits holding the chicken close by the fire while Inkosi
Inkosikazi shuffles around him drawing a circle in the
dust with a stick

YOUNG MAN (V0O)

Legend had it that Inkosi

Inkosikazi was the last son of

the great Zulu king Dingaan

who fought both the Boers and

the British to a standstill

nearly 100 years before and the

night Inkosi Inkosikazi was

conceived stars fell from the

sky until the sun rose
The circle complete the old man sits down opposite the
Boy From a leather pouch he produces several bones He
throws the bones on the ground and studies them for a
moment He begins to wave the fly switch back and forth
in front of the Boys eyes chanting low softly The
Boys eyes grow heavy his lids droop

DREAM - EXT WATERFALL

The Boy and the old man are standing above a great
waterfall In the swirling pool far below are ten
stepping stones linking one bank to the other

YOUNG MAN (V0O)
The medicine man instructed me to
jump off the falls and climb along
the ten stepping stones counting
as I went until I reached dry
land

The Boy jumps cascading down the falls and into the pond
below He clambers up the first rock It is slippery

He falls off and climbs back on buffeted by the spraying
water He makes his way stone by stone toward the other

side

YOUNG MAN (VO)

Even though it was only a dream

I felt as if my struggle to reach

dry land was terrifyingly real

The water was like ice bone-

chilling cold and as I made my

way from one stone to the next I

could feel my strength desert me
The progress from one step to the next gets progressively
harder as the Boy keeps slipping into the swirling water
coughing and sputtering

YOUNG MAN (VO)
I was three rocks in when I ran
out of gas I couldnt pull myself
any further No matter how hard I

tried the current tried harder
I felt myself going under for the
last time

The Boys grip slips off the rock He starts to go
under

EXT FARMYARD - DAWN

The fire has gone out The Boy is still sitting in the
circle the chicken still in his lap His eyes snap
open The first thing he sees is Inkosi Inkosikazi
sitting across from him with a big smile

CUT TO
EXT YARD - DAY

Inkosi Inkosikazi enters the Buick The Boy and his
smiling nanny watch They Boy still holds the chicken

YOUNG MAN (V0O)
Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit
of the great Zulu warriors lived
in me He told me that whenever
trouble arose I should return to
the waterfall and keep stepping
across the rocks until the trouble
passed He said three rocks were
enough to conquer my problem with
the night water that I was very
brave He said I was a man for
all Africa bound to her by my
spirit bound by my dreams

(beat)
And he let me keep the chicken

The Boy and his nanny watch the car go off in a cloud of
dust
CUT TO

8 EXT VELDT - DAY

The Boy sits on a train looking out the window at the
veldt and the wildlife moving across in the distance

A sack on his lap moves The chickens head pops out
The Boy gives him some kernels of corn and scratches
behind his scraggly comb

YOUNG MAN (V0O)
Although I was bound by spirit

and dream to Africa I was bound
by heritage and language to the
birthplace of my grandparents --
England -- a country I had never
seen but one that was to cause
me eminently more problems than
bedwetting ever did

CUT TO

9 EXT ROAD TO SCHOOL
A motorcar driving along the road to the school

YOUNG MAN (VO)
The school I was sent to was
attended and staffed entirely by
Afrikaaners the oldest of the two
white tribes of Africa

CUT TO

INT SCHOOL

The six-year-old walks timorously through the halls
filled with bigger boys -- brash noisy hostile They
only speak the Taal -- Afrikaans Over and over they
jostle or verbally deride the six-year-old knocking his
books down so that when he bends to pick them up he is
kicked in the butt Or pulling his shirt out from under
his jacket and making it hard to move
YOUNG MAN (VO)

I spoke only English The hated

tongue The language of the enemy

who had usurped power and stolen

the country through political

chicanery and military brutality

A mob of boys led by a big bully JAAPIE BOTHA runs

the six-year-old through the bathroom and into the
showers fully clothed He tries to run out Jaapie

Botha grabs him and throws him back in holding him with
one ham-fisted hand under the shower head and turning the
shower on with the other The six-year-old stands
miserable as the stinging water pelts him

YOUNG MAN (V0O)
During the Boer War of 1896
26000 Boer women and children
were herded into detainment camps
by the British where they died
like flies from dysentery

malaria and black water fever

And it seemed I was destined to

shoulder the responsibility for

each and every one of those

deaths
The six-year-old in his first soccer game receives the
ball He tries to move upfield but he is kicked and
pushed the ball taken from him He gets up gamely to
follow the chase only to be flattened blindsided by
Jaapie Botha

YOUNG MAN (V0O)
And no one made this more evident
to me than Jaapie Botha a wheat
farmers son from the Transvaal

CUT TO

INT DORMITORY 11

The six-year-old asleep his chicken perched alertly
atop the bed

YOUNG MAN (VO)
The only time I was at peace was
when I slept Inkosi Inkosikazis
chicken proved to be like his
previous owner a salvation

CUT TO

EXT REAR OF DORMITORY - DAY 12

The Boy builds a small shelter for the CHICKEN who
CLUCKS and forages contentedly

YOUNG MAN (VO)
During the day he would live
outside the dorm happily scarfing
down bugs and grubs secure in a
little house I built for him

CUT TO
INT DORM - NIGHT 13
YOUNG MAN (VO)
And at night he would hop through
the window and perching over my
bed squawking if any intruders
came near

Several boys sneak up in the dark The CHICKEN begins
to CHATTER The six-year-old wakes a shoe in hand
ready to throw The shadows scatter The Boy gives the
chicken a few grains of corn and an affectionate scratch
behind the ear and goes back to sleep
YOUNG MAN (VO)
He was my best and only friend
CUT TO
INT SCHOOL 14

Boys and faculty running through the halls excitedly
showing newspapers with pictures of Hitler and
Chamberlain on the front Posters and slogans with
swastikas are slapped up on walls Some boys mimic
heiling to each other

YOUNG MAN (V0O)

Im sure in time a status quo
would have been achieved between
me and my schoolmates were it not
for the cataclysmic events
occurring in that faraway place
none of us had ever seen

(beat)
Two montjhs after I arrived at
the school World War II broke out
in Europe Hitler had vowed to
crush the British Empire The
Boers sharpened their swords in
anticipation

The six-year-old comes back to his bed in the dorm to

find a swastika carved into it
CUT TO

INT DORMITORY - NIGHT 15

The six-year-old sleeps fitfully There is a MUFFLED
SQUAWK He wakes A blanket is thrown over his head

CUT TO

INT DARKENED BASEMENT ROOM 16

The Boy is dumped on the floor the blanket removed His
eyes open in horror The room is lit by torches

Shadows dance fearfully off two dozen boys with swastika
armbands and leather pistol rigs without pistols strapped
to their sides In front of him on a platform Jaapie
Botha stands his shirtsleeves rolled to the shoulder

as another student painfully tattoo-scars his arm with
a swastika using a knife and blue dye Seeing the six-
year-old Jaapie turns his attention to him and
addresses him in Afrikaans

JAAPIE
God has sent Hitler to deliver us
from the English bastards who stole
our country and killed our people
Heil Hitler

The other boys chorus in

ALL
Heil Hitler

JAAPIE
We will swear a blood oath When
Hitler comes well rise up and
kill the Verdomde Rooineks

ALL
A blood oath A blood oath
Jaapie bends down and grabs the six-year-old by the
shirt front yanking him up

JAAPIE
With your blood

Jaapie slaps the Boy across the mouth three times
Blood flows from his mouth and nose Jaapie dips his

finger in the blood and smears it across his new tattoo

He holds up his bloodied fingers

JAAPIE
We swear allegiance to Adolf
Hitler Heil Hitler

ALL
We swear allegiance to Adolf
Hitler Heil Hitler

JAAPIE

Death to all Englishmen in South
Africa Heil Hitler

The chorus repeats

JAAPIE
God bless the fatherland Heil
Hitler

The voices come back to him stronger

Heil Hitler
Jaapie grabs the six-year-old again

JAAPIE
See what we have in store for
you when Hitler comes Rooinek
Hoy

He gives a command The boys at the far end of the
room part The six-year-olds eyes open in terror

17 HIS POV

20 feet away Inkosi Inkosikazis chicken his chicken
is hung from a rafter upside down haplessly flapping
against his bonds

18 BACK TO SCENE

BOY
No

But before he gets two steps towards the chicken he is
gang-tackled and held Jaapie picks up a sling and a
rock

JAAPIE
For crimes committed against the
whole Boer people I Jaapie
Botha the judge and Uberfuhrer
sentence you and your Rooinek
kaffir chicken to death Heil
Hiter

Heil Hitler

Jaapie starts to swing the sling around and around
six-year-old struggles to get free

ALL
Heil Hitler Heil Hitler
The SLING WHISTLES through the air faster and faster

BOY
No
Jaapie releases the stone It flies true catching
the SQUAWKING struggling CHICKEN flush in the chest
The flapping stops as blood soaks through feathers

Jaapie flings his hand forward victorious
JAAPIE
Heil Hitler
ALL

Heil Hitler

The Boy takes the opportunity to break loose He rushes
Jaapie whose arm is outstretched putting him off
balance The Boy catches him low driving his head into
Jaapies exposed stomach Jaapie falls back and gets

The
the knife used for his tattooing right in his ass
Jaapie Botha bellows like an enraged bull as he grabs
futiley for the embedded blade His cohorts laugh
thinking it tremendously funny until Jaapie removes

the knife and turns with it dripping his own blood his
eyes murderous The laughter dies Jaapies breath

comes hard

JAAPIE
Hang him up

A few boys protest

BOYS
Jaapie No

But Botha is murderous intent on revenge

JAAPIE
Hang him

He waves the bloody knife in the air Three boys grab
the six-year-old and drag him to where the chicken is
hanging Two more boys throw a rope over the same
rafter Others bind the struggling boy trussing his
hands to his sides

JAAPIE
You will pay for the deaths of
our grandfathers and grandmothers
our aunts and uncles All
Rooineks will pay and you will be
first Pull

The boys who tied the rope now yank it over the rafter
The six-year-old is hoisted up until he is eye-level with
the chicken

JAAPIE
In the name of Adolf Hitler and
the fatherland I sentence you to
die Verdomde Rooinek

BOYS
Kill him Kill him Kill him

Jaapie swings the sling overhead faster and faster

Morrie and PK draw a deep breath Together they push
open the double doors Together they stride into a
floodlit fully-packed sports arena and head down the
fan-lined aisle to the raised boxing ring in the center
Schoolboys in their respective school blazers Afrikaan
and English yell whistle and clap PK and Morrie

Now the English schoolboys cheer for their man but PK
does not respond He barely moves He raises an arm in
bare acknowledgment His attention stays focused across
the ring on his shadowboxing opponent PK watches Jannie
dance closely when a low CHANTING begins from outside the
stadium -- African tribal mystical harmonies of black
voices building until the white voices inside the stadium
are stunned to silence The song carries beautifully in
the night For the first time PKs focus is broken but
not like the others in the audience
as to whats happening He has heard this before This
is familiar

This is for him A distant knowi
like a man who has heard the voi
name

Over and over one phrase is ind

Jannies big overhand rights almost nail PK until he

willing to take three punches to land one absorbs PKs
point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout
punches When he has had enough punishment he lunges
into a clinch

PK pushes off as Jannie hammers at his kidneys Backing

An ample house PAN ACROSS a gallery of oil paintings
depicting great moments in Boer history -- the Great Trek

an endless progression of oxcarts heading north the
Battle of Blood River against the Zulu armies the hang-

children herded into a detention camp as their farms burn
in the background Boer kommandos sniping at a British
column on the veldt

PAN FROM the pictures TO photographs sepia-toned his-

pictures Marais points to a photo of a young Boer turn
of the century posed stiffly with a rifle in the slouched
hat of a Boer kommando

Unfortunately

MARAIS
Jan Piet Marais My uncle At
22 he led a kommando for three
years before your people caught
him and hung him

PK
My people
MARAIS
The English
PK

I consider myself an African sir

MARAIS
As do I As do the Zulu the
Xhosa the Pongo the Ndebele
Were all Africans But all from
separate tribes ay

PK

MARAIS

Why do you say that

PK

Because its the whole tribal
idea that creates our problems
here in South Africa

MARAIS

The problems of South Africa my

do not come from tribalism

They come from counter-tribalism
From people insisting that natural
laws which have been in place and
operating since Gods creation
should be tampered with Does

the gazelle sleep with the lion
Does the rhino graze with the
mouse The separation of things

is not coincidental Do you think
a Zulu wants to see his culture
his sense of identity replaced by
someone elses anymore than I do

PK
No sir But I dont think he
wants being a Zulu to mean he is
denied the same rights as
everyone else has

MARAIS
Which is why civilization is
defined by the ability to live
under the rule of law Laws
define rights

PK
But do they define justice
MARAIS
Ah Justice The banner behind
which the English marched as they
gobbled up a quarter of the world
Justice my boy is only relative
to whos in charge

PK
And how long they stay in charge
is only relative to how well they
dispense that justice
(beat)
with all due respect

Marais fixes PK with a stare PKs eyes meet his evenly
unwavering Maria enters

MARIA
Papa would you like coffee in the
library or the parlor

MARAIS
(pleasant)
The library mein leib

Maria smiles at PK and exits He leads PK towards the
library

MARAIS
I cant figure out if youre
brave or foolish

PK
Why is that sir

MARAIS
You come here to ask for permission
to see my daughter Correct

PK
Yes sir

MARAIS
And knowing who I am what I stand
for do you think this sort of
discussion is going to put that
request in a favorable light

PK
I thought a man of your intellectual
reputation wouldnt want his
daughter seeing someone who didnt
think

MARAIS
Let me give you some advice then
Youre right I admire a keen
mind But intellectual reputation
or not I am first a Marais a
member of the Volk

MARAIS (CONTD)
And if youre trying to impress a
member of the Volk with your
intellect dont do it espousing
liberal ideas picked up in an
English private school

PK
These ideas I picked up somewhere
else

Marais opens the library door

On the rock a seven-year-old PK sits looking somewhat

sadly over the landscape A long shadow covers him

The CLICK of a CAMERA is heard PK turns shielding his
eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun toa
tall white-haired figure shirtless in hiking boots
and kneesocks holding a box camera

DOC (FIGURE)
Ja Perfect You will excuse me
please

DOC speaking in German-accented English moves off from
the suns glare down to PKs level On his back is a
knapsack with a cactus sticking out of it

boc
This I do not normally without
permission do ja But to catch
the expression After all it is
the expression that is important
Ja Without the expression the
human being is just a lump of meat
You have some problems I think
I am Professor Karl von Vollensteen

Doc clicks his heels together and bows his head slightly

PK
Im PK
He holds out his hand Doc takes it
boc

Such a young person with such an

old expression I think we can
be friends Ja

Eighteen-year-old PK narrates

PK (VO)
That was how I met Doc as he
insisted I call him A chance
meeting between a directionless
seven-year-old boy and an old
German professor out collecting
cacti on the African bush veldt
(pause)
So began my education

Doc and PK walk the veldt across craggy mountain trails

down dry river beds through the jungle always collecting

cacti and aloe samples Doc always talking always
explaining

PK (VO)
Doc believed the brain had two
functions and that the South
African public school system
unfortunately dealt with only one

boc
The brain PK has two functions
It is the best reference library
ever which is a good thing to
have Ja But also from it comes
original thought In school you
will get all filled up with the
facts Here your brain will learn
where to look how to look how
to think And then you will have
for yourself all the brains that
have ever been

Doc and PK sit high up PK watches the endless animal
migration below while Doc points things out across the

landscape

Doc knew everything He had a love

of learning But his real passion

was centered around two things --

music and cacti

Every specimen Doc found would be
carefully photographed and
catalogued

CUT TO

SUNSET

Doc an PK walk through the cactus garden
boc

If God would choose a plant to
represent Him I think He would
choose of all plants the cactus
This one plant has all the
blessings He tried but failed to
give man It is true Look
The cactus is humble but not
submissive It grows where no
other plant will grow The sun
bakes its back the wind rips it
from cliffs or drowns it in the
dry desert sand Not a complaint
In good times or bad it will
still flower It protects itself
from danger

Doc touches a cactus needle

boc
But it harms no other plant It

has patience and solitude and
modesty In Mexico there is a
cactus that blooms once ina
hundred years and then only at
night That is saintliness of
the highest order I think Ja
From cactus comes medicine to
heal the wounds of men and little
buttons if you eat one you can
touch the face of God or stare
into the mouth of hell It is

the plant of patience solitude
love and madness Modesty
beauty Toughness and gentleness
Of all the plants I think it is
closest to God Ja

PK (VO)
Doc was a hard man to disagree
with So when he decided I must
spend as much time with him to
remedy the flaw in my educational
environment I didnt argue

Everything fits PK Nothing is
unexplained Nature is one big
chain reaction Everything
depends on everything else From
the smallest to the biggest
Always in life an idea starts
small like a tree

Doc shows PK a small tree with an even smaller vine
attached to it
boc
his tree can grow so high it can
touch the face of the sky But
this little vine can choke it and
eep it small Most people are
like these vines Afraid of new
ideas Afraid to let things grow

Doc rips the vine away from the tree

stares and some undertoned hissing and booing from Her

Barberton were sent there to work
at the government prison just
outside town Germany had
covertly supported the Boers in
their two unsuccessful wars
against British rule supplying
food and medical supplies as well
as ample stocks of ammunition

PK (VO) (CONTD)
Germany was an old friend a
trusted friend And in a country
where a handshake is a friendship
and a friendship a bond for life

tensions in Barberton heated up
Suspicion was afoot Spies were
everywhere

They get on line for the Ferris wheel

MARIA

You could have picked a more
agreeable topic

PK

And made much less of an
impression Talk to someone

about their passion Even if they
disagree theyll remember you

It was really the most logical
strategy if you think about it

Do you spend hours thinking
about how to deal with me too

their leaves and branches making
one great green umbrella over all

The wheel stops again at its highest point

I see the sun growing weaker
giving off less light I see the
big trees dying because they
cannot live without a lot of
light I see the little trees
take over the forest because they
learn to adapt

MORRIE
Okay Whats going on

MORRIE

Well why dont you tell me what

PK
Theres an African myth about an
outsider who comes one day and
unites all the tribes into one
against their oppressors They
call it the myth of Onoshobishobi
Ingelosi -- the tadpole angel
That chanting at the school
championships

MORRIE
For you
PK
I havent heard it in years

to disrobe

MORRIE
And how did this honor fall on
your broad back

PK
I told you about bringing tobacco
to the prisoners at Barberton
Well after that was going for a
while I learned that even though
they could send and receive
letters they never did They
couldnt read or write

MORRIE
So you did it for them

PK
Right
MORRIE
And after that
PK

A clothing program for their
families and a food program
One thing sort of led to another

MORRIE
I can see where angel would be
an appropriate title
(beat)
But it was uh this Geel Piet
who was really behind all of it

wasnt it

PK
He was very good at pointing
things out

PK
But its not true that Ima

Who knows what is true and what is
not The legend of Onoshobishobi
Ingelosi is very powerful among
the people They see you box the
Boer and always you win They
have heard the stories from
Barberton The people live with
little hope They must see if the
spirit of the boy still lives in
the man

PK
And if I lose If the spirit of
the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi does
not exist in me anymore then what
will they live with

NGUNI
Less hope But still they must

see It is our way

the result of some carelessness on

he lived in he became an expert in
the art of camouflage a master of
the invisible In this he strove

EXT SOCCER FIELD 104

The doors open to an entire soccer field jammed with
humanity A boxing ring is raised in the center The
only lights in the area directly over it With the
twelve witnesses in the lead the party makes its way
through a path in the crowd An OLD WOMAN with a fly
switch not unlike Inkosikazis speaks from the ring
As PK passes the whispers start

WHISPERS
Onoshobishobi

The Woman in the ring begins to chant The crowd picks

it up

CROWD
Onoshobishopi Ingelosi
Shobi shobi Ingelosi
PK looks back at Maria who is a bit unnerved as are
Morrie and Solly He looks across at Mandoma whose face
is a mask looking straight ahead betraying nothing The
two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners
The Old Woman shuffles over and peers into PKs face

She mutters something inaudible then turns to the crowd

OLD WOMAN
Onoshobishobi Ingelosi

The crowd picks up the chant She waves and the crowd
goes silent Somewhere in the darkness a single voice
begins to sing Nkosi Sikelel I Afrika -- the African
national anthem

The crowd picks it up PK looks down to the front row
where Nguni sits courteously attending to Maria in a seat
of honor among the twelve men in suits

The African national anthem finishes The BELL RINGS
three times The Old Woman is led from the ring An
Indian Referee in all white enters the ring and waves
the two fighters forward

Of course I know about glycerine

Why you dont use it Its only
a little pill under the tongue

Tongues were not made to put
little pills under When I have
to start with that I become
something else

Well until you become something
else the little pills would make
this easier on your heart

A CLAP of THUNDER cuts into their conversation Thick
roiling rain clouds appear suddenly

turn into something else

Lightning splits the sky Rain begins to fall pelting

to the rear of the cave where there is a small opening
He shines the light into it

as somethings supper
Doc stops crawling So does PK A DRIPPING can be
heard

waiting for us

slightly larger tunnel the same size as the first one

Whats that smell

All of a sudden there is a RUSTLING noise

him to the floor and covering him with his body Not

flying through

The bats didnt come from a
shoebox Mr Know-It-All

you off to that fancy-shmancy
school was not such a good idea

PK
It was your idea Youre the
one who pushed for me to go
DOC
Ja But who knew they do such a
good job of boxing up part of

your brain
PK
Which part is that

200 feet wide by 100 feet high filled with stalactites

Wunderbar

The whole chamber glistens with an eerie phosphorescence
Toward one end of the crystallized room eight stalagmites
grown up from the floor cement to form a huge crystal

slab some ten feet off the floor A buttress of stalg-

mites drip off it forming a natural if uneven stairway

How many hundreds of thousands of
years to make this masterpiece
Everything outside can change

A policeman swings at PK who ducks and buries a hook
into the mans ribs followed by another to his jaw
The man goes down

he explodes screaming like a madman

He leaps at Bretyn and bangs one punch after another
into the startled man Bretyns face is broken over and
over against PKs fists Still PK keeps pounding blow

looks over as four huge men enter drillers men whose
faces and bodies are as hard and massive as the rock

One of the men pauses at the door and grabs his head as
an enormous jolt of pain runs through it He shakes it
off and follows his friends to a table

roar He grabs his head and staggers backwards a mad
look comes into his eyes

His three huge frineds rush to grab him He throws
them off as if they were ants

He rips a table out of its bolting to the concrete
floor and flings it across the room

not apply It is a society only

PK comes down a side street A half a dozen men at
cards hard-faced desperadoes see him pass eyeing him
closely PK averts his eyes From behind his back

comes the sound of LIPS PUCKERING loudly indecently
PK swallows hard The sound of a CHARGE turns him to
the six men bolting from their card game after him
whooping with lascivious intent PK takes off

The chase takes PK and his pursuers flying through the
streets of the camp past one identical cement hut after
another People watch disinterested No one raises

a hand to help

PK comes racing around the corner to three of the men

blocking the street in front of him He whirls The
others catch up behind yelling and hooting The two
lines advance

PK gets ready When the first man is close enough he
hits him hard breaking his jaw He swings at another
catching him flush in the face But then the rest are
upon him Even though PK fights like hell he is
overwhelmed The blows come from everywhere beating

him to the ground His arms and legs are firmly grabbed
by four men He is banged hard face down onto a concrete
table The fifth man pulls down his pants and the sixth
begins to undo his own fly All the men scream obsceni-
ties anticipating the rape

PK struggles like hell to no avail As he is about to
be violated a roaring giant of a man tears into the
pack like a bear shredding dogs He scatters the men
knocking some unconscious sending the rest to flight
He stands over PK a looming block of granite with a
wild black beard and coal-black eyes His intent only
becomes clear as to whether he is claiming a prize or
helping a friend when he offers PK his hand lifting PK
effortlessly

He examines PKs bruised face with some concern and
then smiles

PK

You know Rasputin I had them

right where I wanted them

for
Rasputin claps PK on the back and addresses him in
Russian to which PK responds with a smile The two men
walk off together

blocked up and the ore wont
flow

PK scales the sheer rock wall of the funnel his shirt
packed with explosives

PK (VO)
The only way to unblock it is to
set a charge to blow inward And
the only way to do that is to set
the charge in mud which means
climbing up to the mouth of the
stope and coming face-to-face
with the devil

PK reaches the hangup He works at taking a prepared
parcel of gelignite sticks and jamming them carefully
into a crevice As he does the hangup creaks deeply
shifting ominous A few rocks fall PK freezes
holding his breath

A large rock is expelled from the hangup and comes
bouncing down the sides to the funnel just missing PK
crashing through the bars below

PK freezes Elijah holds his breath The crew in the
safty tunnel quakes

Nothing happens

rope dangling from the bomb and inserts a fuse He nods
to Elijah Elijah lights a cheesa stick He hands the
glowing stick to PK PK waves towards the tunnel One

cushioning the steel doors below

powder-mad Botha

Mens faces begin to appear at the iron-meshed windows
People start to bang at the door

PK realizing there is no talking to Botha now does
his best to stay out of the charging giants way

Botha charges him PK sidesteps and hits him with a

left hook The punch has no effect Botha swings out
wildly PK easily dances away Botha picks up

another table and heaves it at PK PK jumps to avoid

it but trips on an overturned stool He goes down

The miners outside crowding three deep yell and shout
People start to make bets

Botha charges PK as PK scrambles up Botha swings The
blow glances off PKs shoulder and sends him flying
spinning over a table Botha leaps at PK driving him
into the wall PK grimaces sagging Botha picks him
up and starts to squeeze him to death in his massive
arms PK his hands free starts to pound on Bothas
ears with his palms Botha screams as the powder head-
ache accelerates through the top of his skull He
drops PK PK rolls away and swings a stool at Bothas
midsection Botha is driven back PK goes to swing

the stool again Botha catches it as if it were made
of balsa He rips it out of PKs hand and flings it
back at him charging behind it

PK goes topping end over end Botha gets a hand on him
and lifts him from behind He flings PK over the bar
PK hits the floor stunned Botha pulls at the bar
trying to get at PK

He rocks the bar and rocks the bar as PK is trying to
regain his bearings Finally with one tremendous rip
the bar comes away from its bolting Botha pulls it
aside

PK rises just as Botha moves in PK hits him three
solid shots to the stomach but Botha hardly feels
them He grabs PK and starts to squeeze him again

wasnt fleeing That one day
I would return Inkosi
Inkosikasi was right I was a
man for all Africa Bound to
her by my spirit Bound by my
dreams And Africa had taught
me the lesson I would take out
into the world and one day bring
back Great changes can come from
the power of many But only when
the many join together and create
what is invincible The Power of
One

ZOOM OUT as PK continues walking out of the camp and
