Woody and Slinky drop

SIDE DRIVEWAY

-and land Through SHEETS OF RAIN they spot RC on the
other side The toy car tries to reach them but only slips
farther down the drain towards the street’s RUSHING RIVER
Woody crosses the driveway stretching Slinky as far as he
cancomes up short Has to separate from Slinky and hold
his paw to extend his reach Not enoughRC slips further
when -- Woody suddenly can grab hold of RC

-He looks back to BO AT THE WINDOW A CHAIN OF “BARREL FULL
OF MONKEYS” now extends from her staff to Slink’s tail Phew

--a CAR pulls into the driveway

Headlights LIGHT UP WOODY The three toys go still and are
SHOT BACK to the house Slam against the siding

Unawares a MAN (VISTOR FATHER) jumps out of the car and
rushes to the front door

ON MOLLY’S WINDOW

The toys drag Slinky back up Pull RC inside first Bo smiles
down at Woody as he climbs They did it -- Suddenly Bo turns
back inside

SLAM THE WINDOW SHUTS ON SLINKY

OUTSIDE

Woody clambers up PEEKS INSIDE to see

--Mom grab Bo Peep

VISITOR FATHER
Oh its beautiful

ANDY’S MOM
--I’m so glad to see this old lamp
go to a good home Weve had it
since Molly was a baby

To Woody’s shock Mom places Bo her sheep and lamp into a
CARDBOARD BOX

VISITOR FATHER
Molly are you sure it’s alright

MOLLY
Yeah I don’t want it anymore

Woody watches helpless as Mom hands off the box to the
Visitor Father They head back downstairs

INSIDE

The toys jump up Throw open the window Pull up Slinky Dog
andnobody else

BUZZ
Where’s Woody

OUTSIDE
The Visitor Father walks to the trunk of his car Sets the
box down to search his pockets Jogs back to the house and
knocks Mom answers
VISITOR FATHER

here
In that unattended moment BO’S BOX IS SUDDENLY DRAGGED
UNDER THE CAR

LIGHTNING FLASHES to reveal Woody opening the box Bo is
comforting her sheep in the darkness

BO
WwooDY--

WOODY
Quick We’1ll sneak in the hedges
before he’s back--

BO

BO
It’s time for the next kid

The two toys check the front door as they HEAR THE VISITOR
FATHER SAY HIS GOODBYES -- Time is running out Bo looks back
to Woody Hesitant
BO

You knowkids lose their toys

every day Sometimes they get left

in the yardor put in the wrong

box

Woody looks from Bo to the box The sheep back up to make
room He understands

WOODY
And that boxgets taken away

A small hopeful nod from Bo Woody places his hands on the
edge of the box --

ANDY (0OS)
Mom where’s Woody

Woody is drawn to the sound of Andy’s voice The boy is now
searching the yard

ANDY’S MOM
Andy Come inside

ANDY
I can’t find Woody

Bo watches WOODY’S HANDS slip away from the box His eyes
then meet hers He can’t do it

Bo gives a pained smile of understanding

She straightens Woody’s hat one last time Gently touches his
face

WIDE ON THE CAR
The Visitor Father exits the house

VISITOR FATHER
Well good night

»as the box scoots back out from under the car

ANDYS MOM
Goodbye Drive safe

LIGHTS SHRINK and disappear in the driving rainthen go

lifeless as

ANDY
There you are

-Andy picks him up

ANDY

ANDYS MOM

Andy runs to the warm light of the open front door

WE RISE UP IN THE AIR The rain clears The sky goes from
dark to light until we seeWHITE CLOUDS IN A BLUE SKY that
recall Andy’s wallpaper

this toy - is crucial to Bonnie
getting adjusted to kindergarten

DOLLY
Woody aren’t you being a little
dramatic about all this

WOODY
I know this is new to everybody

Forky

and starts walking

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Woody walks down the dark empty road

WOODY
Forky where are you

Woody stops Hears a STRUGGLE in the grass Finds Forky stuck
with his prongs embedded in the dirt
EXT HIGHWAY - LATER

Woody is now dragging Forky by his pipe cleaner hand

FORKY

WOODY

FORKY

Why do I have to be a toy

WOODY
Because you have Bonnie’s name
written on the bottom of your
sticks

FORKY
Why do I have Bonnies name written
on the bottom of my sticks

WOODY

time Right

FORKY

night

FORKY
The big white fluffy thing

WOODY

No not her pillow - you

(considers)
Alright Forky You have to
understand how lucky you are right
now You’re Bonnie’s toy You are
going to help create happy memories
that will last for the rest of her
life

Woody stops to see if this is getting through to him Nope
Forky’s been distracted by the existence of his own hand

FORKY
Huh What

Woody is furious Turns away to calm himself

WOODY
Okay doing it for BonnieDoing

Bonnie

(turns back to Forky)

Okay like it or not you are a

TOWN OF GRAND BASIN

FORKY (CONTD)

WOODY
Whoa whoa Forky slow down Forky

Woody runs to catch up

EXT GRAND BASIN - MAIN STREET - DAWN

A quaint turn-of-the-century roadside town Made up of a few
streets Only one of everything A banner over the street
advertises “CARNIVAL DAYS” The entire town still asleep
Nothing moves except

TWO SMALL TOYS
Woody and Forky skirt cautiously along the empty street

trying to stay hidden Woody spies the illuminated “RV PARK”
SIGN poking above the one-story buildings one street over

WOODY
Forky look Bonnie’s right over
there

FORKY
Hurry

Forky starts running towards the RV park Woody is right
behind him -- then stops short POINTS OF LIGHT dot the
ground at his feet He looks up at a STOREFRONT WINDOW to
see

BO PEEP’S LAMP

Like out of a dream it GLOWS on display amongst ANTIQUES
What the Woody walks towards it like a mirage

Forky realizes Woody isn’t with him Returns

FORKY
Woody

WOODY
Bo

Woody gets a good look at the lamp Yep it’s hers Glances
back at the RV park sign Makes a decisionand heads for
the STORE’S FRONT DOOR

FORKY
Woody Aren’t we - aren’t we going
to Bonnie
Woody peers into the dark store Assesses the locked door
WOODY

Clutching Forky Woody climbs through the FRONT DOOR MAIL
SLOT The name of the store reads SECOND CHANCE ANTIQUES

INT ANTIQUE STORE - CONTINUOUS

The two toys stand in the midst of an OVERWHELMING COLLECTION
OF ANTIQUES To them it’s a small city the mis-matched
cabinetry are like skyscrapers the aisles avenues but it’s
chaotic - a virtual maze It feels more like a spooky museum

VARIOUS SHOTS of Woody and Forky wandering the store Every
time Woody calls out Forky mimics him

WOODY
Bo

FORKY
Bo

Nothing The store is dead Forky starts to play with the
word “Bo” Bored

FORKY
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo - Can we go back
to Bonnie now I dont see your
friend

Woody can’t hide his disappointment

©2019 DISNEYPIXAR
WOODY
Yeah okay she’s not in here
Come on let’s go

The sound of SQUEAKY WHEELS It’s coming towards them
Woody pulls Forky behind some FLOOR-LEVEL KNICK-KNACKS They
watch as AROUND THE CORNER appears

--A BABY DOLL CARRIAGE

And it’s being walked by a VENTRILOQUIST DUMMY No emotions
Just a slow mindless stroll

FORKY
Is that Bo

-- The dummy stops Its head snaps unnaturally far over its
shoulder and STARES STRAIGHT AT THEM

Caught Woody steps out All casual

WOODY
Uh Hey Howdy hey there Sorry
to bother you um but--

VOICE (0S)

WOODY

back Pulls the string

GABBY GABBY VOICEBOX
(distorted)
“IM GABBY GABBY AND I LOVE YOU”

FORKY
Wow you need to fix that

GABBY GABBY

rounds the corner -- sees Harmony in the aisle GOES LIMP and
PULLS HIS STRING

Gabby raises her hand to halt the dummies Alone she moves
closer to Woody as she pleads her case

GABBY GABBY (CONTD)
I can only imagine what it must
have been like for you All that
time you spent with Andyriding a
bike with him for the first time
comforting him when he skinned his
knee proudly watching him grow up
and then you got a second chance
with Bonnie giving her comfort
when she’s scared at school
helping her when she needs it most
You’ve been there through all their
ups and downsPlease Be honest
with me - was it as wonderful as it
sounds

Woody takes this in His eyes can’t deny it

WOODY
--It was

Gabby smiles sadly
GABBY GABBY
All I want is a chance for just one
of those moments I’d give anything
to be loved the way you have
