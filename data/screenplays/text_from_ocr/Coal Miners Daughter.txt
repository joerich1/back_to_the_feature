Doo watches helpless from the wings She stops talking
stares blankly out at the audience which is absolutely
silent as if the hall were empty Finally two band members
gently lead her to the wings She looks at Doo as if he
were a stranger then collapses He catches her picks her
up in his arms Confusion all around Get a doctor
Bring her this way etc Doo starts down the corridor
faster and faster until he is almost running His eyes

are filled with tears
