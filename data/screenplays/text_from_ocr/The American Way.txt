INT OAKLEY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY YOUNG BILL OAKLEY 12 stands in a kitchen corner Completely
motionless eyes down Only sound a DRIPPING FAUCET

YOUNG BILL’S POV His MOTHER’s manicured hand twitches by his
feet Nails soaked in a puddle of blood

A MAN’S HAND enters FRAME pats Young Bill’s cheek He
flinches Keeps staring at the floor The owner of the hand
walks away We hear a back door OPEN and footsteps RETREAT

Young Bill releases his held-in breath Gasps Shakes like
a leaf Starts to cry still terrified Looks up sees

The back door at the rear of the kitchen wide open
Footprints are visible in the dirt outside extending towards
woods in the distance

ANOTHER DOOR OPENS 0S Young Bill looks over and sees

The FRONT DOOR of the house YOUNG JOHN OAKLEY 10 enters
with his bike The tire catches on an overturned coat rack
Young John looks down Sees the body of his half-sister
BETSY 4 buried beneath the coat rack Her dress singed
from a muzzle blast

The bike CLATTERS to the floor Young John stunned looks
up to see what is only now revealed to us

The HALLWAY leading from the front door to the kitchen
Betsy at John’s feet Their FATHER sprawled halfway down
the hall back-of-head bullet wound His blood spattered on
a framed family photo on the wall -- Young John Young Bill
Mother Father Betsy all smiling On the kitchen floor
Mother’s body her hand twitching at Young Bill’s feet

Young John finally makes eye contact with Young Bill Stares
at him An odd accusatory expression Not frightened like
Young Bill Angry As if Young Bill’s at fault for this
Young Bill doesn’t respond

Young John turns Walks out the door like a kid who’s been
sent to stand in the corner for punishment

Young Bill pauses a moment then follows

EXT OAKLEY HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Young Bill steps onto the front porch of what is now revealed
to be a large two-story turn-of-the-century upstate New York
home Peaceful green circled by forest He sees
Young John sitting on a swing the lone piece of decoration
on the vast lawn Arms wrapped around himself in a bear hug
rocking back and forth SINGING A SONG to himself

Young Bill watches His eyes unreadable SUPER IN “1918”

CLOSE ON YOUNG JOHN’S FACE Rocking back and forth SINGING -
and we abruptly

MATCH CUT TO

ELLIOT OAKLEY 7 SINGING in a CHURCH CHOIR

BACK TO BILL Still watching Eyes still unreadable Face
twenty years older Young no longer SUPER IN “1938”

Elliott looks into the crowded church pews Spots Bill and
his mother MARIE early 30s Bill nods -- good job
Elliott smiles

A man in a rumpled suit CARROLL 30s squeezes his way into
the pew behind Bill Nudges Bill’s shoulder whispers They
start talking intently Marie watches them disapproving

The choir finishes Bill doesn’t notice Marie elbows him
He APPLAUDS along with the other PARISHIONERS

EXT CHURCH - DAY A healthy crowd files out of the church somewhere in 1930s
Manhattan Bill Marie and Elliott make their way to the
sidewalk where Carroll waits by a radio-patrol car Bill
turns to Marie leans in for a kiss She turns her head
offering her cheek

Bill sighs ruffles Elliott’s hair then hurries into the
back seat of the car with Carroll

INT RADIO-PATROL CAR - CONTINUOUS

CARROLL
Marie didn’t look happy

BILL
Kidding You had your back turned
she was naked doing cartwheels

He taps the driver’s seat -- the car takes off Bill looks
out the window at STRIKING FACTORY WORKERS along the street
Waving UNITED FACTORY WORKER signs decorated with Socialist
and Communist slogans
PEARCY (VO)
The FBI does not consider the mob a
true menace we are told

INT FEDERAL OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

CU -- A BandW murder photo its victim with a bullet in the
head The photo is flipped to another one -- this victim
with an axe to the back Another -- acid-washed to a crisp

PEARCY (0S)
Good old J Edgar Hoover is more
concerned with real threats

The FEDERAL AGENT glancing through the photos YAWNS A
mirror image of the ten or fifteen other AGENTS in the room
all perusing similar photos Including Bill and Carroll

PEARCY (0S) (CONTD)
Subversivesbunny rabbits

Snickers Up front PEARCY 50s short wire-rim glasses
taps a chalkboard with a sawed-off pool cue (more “manly”
than a ruler) In a rat-a-tat voice bigger than his body

PEARCY (CONTD)
But we know better gents We damn
well know better

INT PRISON - ADMITTANCE DESK - DAY

Bill and Carroll sign their names in a ledger then empty
their pockets handing badges and guns to a DESK GUARD

PEARCY (VO)

And personally Id say

(in a fey lisp)
-Mith-tah Hoov-ah needs to change
out of his fucking skirt

(more chuckles)
Every death you see is “officially”
unsolved and every one we know
is the work of the same group

INT FEDERAL OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Pearcy draws his cue along a line-up of photographs taped to

the chalkboard Mug shots and photos of GANGSTERS All
fairly dapper All hard as nails
PEARCY
The Combination Spawn of Lepke
Buchalter Murder Incorporated

INT PRISON - CELLBLOCK HALLWAY - DAY

Bill and Carroll walk down a long dank hallway lined with
cells Bill scans the faces of the PRISONERS pressed against
their bars His eyes betray no sympathy

PEARCY (VO)
Every reason Lady Liberty shoulda
kept her legs crossed Herbie
Eckstein Dead-Eye Tannenbaum
Pittsburgh Phil Strauss so on and
such Killers in our own backyard
on call for any hit nationwide
They have better health benefits
than us Because make no mistake
gentlemen this is a union
(grumbling round the room)
Gossip spilled back to our Nyall
bank job informant It seems Bad
Guy Central is raising its sights

INT FEDERAL OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Pearcy moves his cue to another larger photo

PEARCY
Gordon Gance I believe you know

CARROLL
Why do they want to kill a senator

PEARCY
Why is irrelevant What is
relevant is the who the where the
when none of which we know

RANDOM AGENT
Can’t our informant find out the
particulars

PEARCY
He ran into a setback See the
snap with the creative use of hedge
trimmers

The Random Agent finds the photo in question WHISTLES
PEARCY (CONTD)
No one knows their inner workings
It’s clandestine like the Girl
Scouts and almost as mean

Laughter all around

INT PRISON - VISITORS ROOM - DAY

Cleared of everybody but Bill sitting at a bare metal table
matchbox and cigarette in hand He looks at Carroll
standing in the hallway outside smoking Looks down Sees
the matchsticks he keeps nervously removing from the
matchbox All snapped in two and sprinkled on the table

PEARCY (VO)
If a senator dies Hoover’s career
may die with him So to prevent
our glorious leader from looking
like his priorities are up his ass
along with anything else we’ll
refrain from speculating on

INT FEDERAL OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Laughter from the agents Not from Bill

PEARCY
--we need to keep these fuckers
from pulling off any front-page
exploits Questions

RANDOM AGENT
We need a guy on the inside

PEARCY
Fred Glad you made it Question
whose retard cousin you fuck to get
your G-man badge

(Random Agent shrinks)

These are hard-ass Jews kiddies
They don’t break bread with law-
abiding citizens of any stripe

ANOTHER AGENT
Can’t we warn Gance

PEARCY
His rep is based on not fearing the
mob He won’t hide or accept
protection meaning we have to save
the day alone Boo-hoo
CARROLL
So how do we get in Considering
we can’t get in

PEARCY
We’ve found a weak link Which is
irony of ironies the toughest link
in the fucking chain

Pearcy pulls down the photo of Gance revealing a new photo
A chisel-cheeked fiery-eyed man 50s

Bill slowly rises in his seat as he stares at the image

PEARCY (CONTD)
Charlie Cohen The tippy-top
erupting fucking peak of Vesuvius

INT PRISON - VISITORS ROOM - DAY

Bill straightens his back as a door is opened behind him A
PRISONER in cuffs is led to the chair opposite him and seated
by a GUARD His head down We don’t see his face

PEARCY (VO)
Suspect in thirty-seven murders
probably involved in sixty more
arrested for none No biographical
data on record but he’s the only
member with no family Solitude
equals vulnerability

INT FEDERAL OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
PEARCY
We need someone to get close find
out what he knows
As Pearcy continues talking Bill stares at Cohen’s photo
with an unblinking focus CLOSE ON HIS FACESOUND FADES TO
A LOW MUFFLE REPLACED BY YOUNG JOHN’S SINGINGand we
MATCH CUT TO
YOUNG BILL’S FACE Staring at his mother’s body Glancing
at the EYES of the man standing above him Trying not to
tremble as the man PATS HIS CHEEKwhich suddenly shifts
BACK TO

Carroll FLICKING Bill’s cheek Bill snaps to as Pearcy raps
his pool cue on the floor with a CRACK
PEARCY (CONTD)

This op is as deep as deep gets
Hoover won’t approve anti-mob
action for reasons known only to
him I say again We Know Better
Thus he will not know this op
exists unless we succeed But
rest assured if we preempt him
from public embarrassment it
should scare him into letting us
pursue gangsters for a change
instead of wasting our time on
Commies And I for one would
like to see that happen I want a
shot at the real enemy

(nods murmurs of assent)
Nail them to the wall gents
Hoover will be grateful as will I

RANDOM AGENT
How grateful

PEARCY
An immediate promotion for one
And a corner office

ANOTHER AGENT
A private office

PEARCY
You want a miracle call Santa
Claus or his brother the Pope

doubly doubt he hands us our case
if he gets himself or Cohen killed

let you calm your anger
JOHN
What do you know about being angry

COHEN

What do you know about being a Jew

Carroll reaches into his coat removes the photo John gave
Bill Lays it on the body where John can see it

CARROLL
If you didn’t kill him they would
have killed you He didn’t want
you to have to make that choice
So he put a gun to his head and
chose for himself

John closes his eyes He looks as if he’s going to explode
Carroll takes out Bill’s gun tosses it in the trunk

head with his own gun then you

the corner of the tower where Cohen stands RETURNING FIRE

A bullet glances off the railing above John’s head He
ducks slips on the ice-crusted escape Falls Catches the
escape with his free hand just in time -- his gun slides away
on the escape

Cohen empties his gun FIRING at John who twists and turns
trying to dodge One shot GRAZES his loose arm He grits
his teeth but doesn’t let go

Cohen’s gun CLICKS He curses looks for an escape route
He sees a parked car directly below --

John dangles in mid-air Sucks in breath pulls himself up
Moves to the edge of the fire escape scooping up his pistol
on the way then stops not about to jump to the adjacent
landing Cohen looks down John takes aim --

John rounds the corner into the crowded festival Looks back
and forth -- Cohen is nowhere to be seen Pushes his way
through the crowd which is surging en masse to the next
street over where the sounds of a PARADE can be heard

As he passes a darkened taxi garage he looks in Spots a
glimmer of movement between the cabs Looks back and forth
considers a moment then moves down

THE GARAGE RAMP

Entering darkness he raises his gun

A FLASH of motion John spins to find a trash can flying
toward him He raises his arms The can knocks him down
Cohen charges from his hiding spot out into the snow
John gets to his feet runs up the ramp to

THE BLOCK

Catches a glimpse of Cohen moving through the crowd toward
the parade He gives chase finding himself confronted with

A PACKED LOWER EAST SIDE PARADE

Americana-themed in honor of Armistice Day Marching band
leading the crowd Various IMMIGRANTS sporting flags
buttons etc Bystanders in both directions separated from
the marchers by police barricades Cohen nowhere to be seen

John pushes his way through the bystanders searching Then
he sees what appears to be Cohen moving through the parade
He ducks under the barricade and enters the moving throng
The band’s drums RAT-A-TATTING ahead of him

He slips past marchers in the direction of Cohen who is no
longer visible Faster and faster he moves No sign of his
quarrythen

A BLADE darts out from somewhere near John SLASHES his
grazed arm He gasps clutches his arm turns -- the blade’s
owner is nowhere to be seen The push of people forces him
to keep moving

Then another SLASH at his shoulder He tries not to scream
turns in another direction No Cohen just jolly paraders

Another SLASH -- this time on his chest Then another and
another He turns back and forth raising his arms trying
to block the blade that’s dicing him from all sideshis
shirt soaks with bloodSLASH SLASH SLASH --

Suddenly he has a realization He pulls out his pistol
raises it in the air FIRES The BANG is just loud enough to
top the crowd’s noise Nearby paraders FREAK scramble to
get away from him He stands motionless as the throng around
him parts

All except for COHEN who stands right behind John His ever-
present knife in his hand like a reaper’s scythe

SOUND FADES TO NOTHING AS
John turns Sees Cohen lifting his knife

Then he sees something just beyond Cohen Something that
causes his face to go fathomlessly blank

BILL Standing a few feet behind Cohen Staring at him
Cohen sees the look on John’s face Turns Sees Bill
Recognizes him Also recognizes the sawed-off in Bill’s hand
as he raises it to Cohen’s chest

Cohen smiles just slightly BEAT

blown practically into John’s arms

HOOVER

Have you ever read your personnel
file You should Sit

(Bill sits)
The level of thoroughness we use
can be disturbing even to myself
I’m afraid to look at mine It
deprives one of the ability to
forget Tell me about your mother

BILL
Tell me about something first

HOOVER
And what might that be

BILL
Operation Zero Red

Hoover looks up Small hooded eyes

HOOVER
Classified above your clearance
level I’m afraid

BILL
You authorized the killing of
American citizens --

HOOVER
I turned common hoods into silent
soldiers preserving democracy
which is what I was put here to do
Tell me about your mother
BILL
You’re a murderer A traitor anda
disgrace to your post --

HOOVER
And a realist Like all do-
gooders you seem to find reality
distasteful May I suggest you try
a career in the floral industry

Bill nearly leaps from his seat Hoover sighs

HOOVER (CONTD)
Our job is to dismantle threats
foreign to this country Now if I
owed you my reasons I’d explain
that crime isn’t foreign to this
country it is an integral part of
it one we can fight to stalemate
like a bad cold or one we can put
to use to vaccinate against more
troubling illnesses But I don’t
feel I owe you anything So accept
that I will continue acting as I
feel necessary Agreed

Bill stares at him stunned Finally

BILL

No No you won’t

(pause)
As you said the level of
thoroughness in your files can be
disturbing I imagine the public
would be even more disturbed than a
worldly man like yourself

Hoover smiles a bit maybe impressed maybe not

HOOVER
You have the Zero Red files
(beat)
Hmm Well played Fortunately I
have other stories to entertain me
So mothers Shall we proceed

Bill is silent Hoover nods looks down at Bill’s file

--What are you --

HOOVER

(interrupting)
Soon married to Jack Oakley who
ushered her through immigration

number of Limerick Jews were jailed
after anti-pogrom riots fighting
back Good for them The most
violent got ten years Upon
release in 1918 they emigrated as
well Did Kaitlin ever talk of
your real father

didn’t know existed are left
alive He is not seen again

And all these years later you
persist in some vendetta against
poor Charlie Cohen Hard for us to
track immigrants when they go by
their middle names Not very
sporting of them

(pause)
John blames you for your family’s
massacre Imagine how he’d feel if
he knew you’d finished the job

Bill slowly bites his knuckle Melting down

HOOVER (CONT’D)
I could have you dead within the
hour Or you can do as I ask and
try to restore your life Your
choice

Bill looks at Hoover In shock barely composed

BILL
--Whatdo you propose

HOOVER
Drop this Return my files
Forget you ever heard of the FBI
Repeat the word “compromise” over
and over and over

BEAT A moment of cruel choice Bill doesn’t move But his
choice is clear Hoover nods

HOOVER (CONT’D)
The marshals will escort you home
Well have to put you in protective
custody of course The mob holds
grudges even against those who
rise from the dead Now if you’1ll
excuse me I have work to do

Bill is speechless Hoover waits for him to leave He
slowly rises walks to the door On his way out
