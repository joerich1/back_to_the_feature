Battlestar Galactaca

FADE IN

ON A STARFIELD

A myriad glowing jewels of lightand a stillness that is both friend
and enemy

Suddenly a full-throated burst of a single chord played by a symphony
orchestra as we see superimposed over the starfield the words
GALACTICA

Saga of a Star World

Then as the lettering drifts off into space the chord begins to
diminish until it is only sustained by the ethereal high pitched
strains of a muted string section and a voice speaks to us against
the ever present stars

ADAMAS VOICE

Thousands of years ago colonies were established throughout the
universe by a mother race from the far reaches of spaceThis race
of people was known as humanoidhuman beingsAn unsubjugatable
resourceful people who loved freedom adventure even conflict
Now in the seventh millennium of time a solemn and dramatic event
is taking placeA peace envoy representing the twelve known
colonies of man moves through space in hopes of bringing to a close
a thousand year war tat has seen the humans embattled by an alliance
of beingsbent on their destructionThe mission of the colonial
fleet would bring the star world a new beginningor

witnessed by manthe universea giant starfield in all its
majestyIn the center of the room is a long table at which the
center of attention is a bearded man whose face glows with the
warmth and wisdom of the ages He raises a silver chalice and the
twelve gentlemen around him clad in Roman-like toga and tunic tops
over tighter fitting pants and boots come to rapt attention

OLD MAN

GentlemenI know you are all anxious to return to your ships before
our rendezvous with the Cylons but I think it appropriate to toast
the most significant event in the history of manId like to raise
my chalice to you

We study the study dignified faces of twelve men flanking the old
mansix to a sidetheir features betraying substantive
differencesThey are red black yellow whiteindeed every
variation

PRESIDENT

Not merely the quorum of the twelve representing the twelve colonies
of man but my friendsand the greatest leaders ever assembledAs
we approach the seventh millennium of time the human race will at
last know peaceThanks to you

As the are about to salute each with his own chalice another voice
is heard

BALTAR

Inappropriate

Faces swing Baltars waystartled by his impudence

BALTAR

I say we lift our cups to he who has for the first time brought the
dissident races of mankind together to speak as one before the
AllianceTo President Adar and to peace

Even the humble attempt at quelling the voices cannot deny these men
their measure of gratitudethe cups are raised and the Old Man
joins in

PRESIDENT

To peaceat long last

POINT OF VIEW FROM A COLONIAL FIGHTER PLANE COCKPIT

clouds

SKYLERS VOICE

What is it

ZAC
pulling back on the throttle slowingHe puts the vehicle on the
scanner and punches up a combination

ZAC

Tell ya in a flash

ON ZACS SCANNER

On one side of the screen we see the Cylon space vehicle On the
other side of the screen we see a series of airship profile
silhouettes racing by Finally an image stops It is a match A
great deal of printing appears below the silhouettes in an
unfamiliar text

ZAC

Warbook says a Cylon tanker Scanner reads it empty

SKYLER

Whats an empty tanker doing out here

ZAC

And wheres the other ship

SKYLER

Screened off by this one Wonder what theyre hiding

ZAC

I dont know but its awfully close to that storm

SKYLER

We came to look

ZAC

Be careful Skyler I have a funny feeling about this

SKYLER

Youre not old enough to have funny feelings Besides while were
stuck out on patrol Starbucks pulled a couple of those Geminis
into a card game I want to get back before he cleans them out

INSIDE A PILOTS READY ROOM

A Spartan standby area for fighter pilots Camera moves past a young
man in flight clothes sleepinganother readingand as we come to
the end of the room a group stand behind one side of a circular card
table forming a gallery for a handsome young man called Starbuck
who eyes his round playing cards with wily skill

STARBUCK

(with feigned ease)

Just to keep the game instructive and because youre new to it Ill
only wager

Starbuck pushes half of his square cubits of gold in front of him
The two men look then whisper A confident smile passes amongst the
gallery

GEMON

Despite the humbleness of this handfor the honor of our home
colony Gemini we must challenge you

The young man pushes forth a measure of golden cubits equal to the
pot The gallery tenses

GEMON

And for the glory of our colony another equal measure

Gemon pushes out another pile in effect doubling the stakes The
gallery holds its collective breath Starbuck feigns continued ease
STARBUCK

Well in the name of our home planet Caprica and for her
everlasting glory Ill measure your increase and double it
The gallery gulps as Starbuck pushes in his remaining cubits and
turns to them

STARBUCK

(sotto voice)

Come on come on guys up with the rest of it

BOOMER

Could we speak with you for a moment In private

(To the Geminis)

Only be a flash fellas

Boomer a trim-looking black man Jolly a hefty hunk of a guy and
Greenbean a stringbean of a flyer next to him face the now-standing
Starbuck and speak to him through clenched teeth and heated whispers
BOOMER

Are you crazy

STARBUCK

(sotto voice)

Werent you listening This is for the glory of Caprica Doesnt that
mean anything to you

The gallery stares at Starbuck blankly

STARBUCK

Look have I ever steered you guys wrong

The gallery continues to stare blankly

STARBUCK

(sotto voice)

All rightlook at it this way Well double our money Theyre
trying to buy the pot

JOLLY

(sotto voice)

You told us these Geminis didnt understand the game

BOOMER

(sotto)

They caught on fast Now come on or we lose everything weve got in
that game

Reluctantly the gallery comes up with an additional measure of gold
cubits Starbuck pushes them out onto the table and turns his cards
over

BOOMER

Beat that

allery stare at the cards stricken as the Gemon rakes in the golden
ubits

PRESIDENT

I see the party isnt a huge success with all my children

ADAMA

Its what awaits us out there that troubles me

PRESIDENT

Surely you dont cling to your suspicions about the Cylons They
asked for this armistice They want peace

ADAMA

Forgive me Mr President but they hate humans with every fiber of
their existence We love freedom We love independence To feel to
question To rebel against oppression Its an alien way of existing
they will never accept

PRESIDENT

But they have Through Baltar they have sued for peace

ADAMA

swings a sober look back to the President

Yes Of course youre right

jumble

SKYLER

I cant read anything inside Shes jamming us

ZAC

(alarmed)

Thatll put you smack in the storm If its asteroids itll rip us
apart

SKYLER

Not us kid You stay put I dont want it said that I taught my kid
brother bad habits on his first patrol

IN A READY ROOM - CLOSE ON A CARD HAND

Starbuck sits down at the card table a small grin appearing on his
face He pushes a large stack of cubits out into the center of the
table

STARBUCK

Ok guys one hand Sudden death

The gentlemen from Gemini consider the odds and push an equal amount
of cubits to the center of the table

GEMON

Sudden death

Starbuck flashes a fiendish child-like grin and begins to deal the
cards

ON THE FLIGHT BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA

ADAMA

Our patrol is under attack Mr President Were not sure by whom
The President appears on a monitor Baltar is beside him

ADAMA

As a precautionary measure Id like to launch intercept fighters
Baltar leans into the President whispering to him The President
nods

PRESIDENT

Quite right Baltar Commander as a precautionary measure I insist
upon restraint If this turns out to be an encounter with some outlaw
traffic we could jeopardize the entire cause of peace by displaying
fighters when we are so close to our rendezvous

ADAMA

Mister President two of my aircraft are under armed attack
PRESIDENT

By forces unknown You are not to launch until the situation is more
clear

ADAMA

Sir may I at least urge you to bring the fleet to a state of alert
PRESIDENT

I will consider it Thank you Commander

The screen goes black

TIGH

Hell consider it Has he lost his mind

ADAMA

Colonel

The Colonel looks quickly around at the hushed bridge quite
embarrassed at his own outburst

TIGH

Im sorry Commander its just thatwell

ADAMA

Yes Colonel What is it

TIGH

The patrol is under the command of Captain Skyler

ADAMA

Well if I cant have confidence in my eldest son who can I depend
on

ON ZAC

He is looking across the sky

ZAC

Skylerbetter look at your scanner

SKYLER

looks

THE SCANNER

shows a solid wave of targets coming from somewhere in the distance
SKYLER

But a thousand-to-one is hardly fair

ZAC

What does it mean Skyler

SKYLER

It means there isnt going to be any peace There may not be anything
if we dont warn the fleet

ZAC

You go Skyler Im short two engines I wont be able to keep up
with you

SKYLER

I cant leave you Zac

ZAC

You have toand Ill be all right If I put my foot in that turbo
Ill make it back ahead of them Now go on Youve got to warn the
fleet

A sober mood descends across Skylers face

SKYLER

You can fly with me any time kid Good luck

Skyler punches the buttons and the roar of the turbo thruster
responds

ZAC

Come on baby give me all you can

He pushes the stick forward and moves off at a much slower speed
ON THE FLIGHT BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA

TIGH

Still nothing from the fighters sir Their transmission is being
deliberately jammed If we dont launch

ADAMA

We cannot launch when it has been expressly forbidden

(on everyones tense look

This might however be an appropriate time to order a test of our
battle stations drill

But all hands charge for the doors grabbing helmets and flight kits
ON THE CATAPULT DECK

A vacuum tube races along the ceiling of a long narrow chamber in
which countless fighter ships sit side by side in powerful launching
cribs As the vehicle within the overhead vacuum tube progresses down
the flight line pilots emerge from chutes leading from the overhead
tube then race on foot for their individual fighter craft Ground
teams are already on hand preparing the lethal-looking planes for
immediate launch

STARBUCK

emerges from his drop and runs to the cockpit of his plane A member
of the ground crew looks up from where he is hurriedly preparing the

ON THE PRESIDENT ON THE BRIDGE OF THE ATLANTIA

PRESIDENT

Yes Commander

ADAMA

Mister President a wall of unidentified craft are closing towards
the fleet

Baltar leans towards the President

BALTAR

Possibly a Cylon welcoming committee

ADAMA

May I suggest that at the very least we launch a welcoming committee
of our own

BALTAR

Mister President there remain many hostile feelings amongst our
Warriors The likelihood of an unfortunate incident with all those
pilots in the sky at once

PRESIDENT

A good point Baltar Did you hear that Commander

Adama is beside himself

ADAMA

No Mister President I cant possibly have heard correctly Did
Count Baltar suggest we allow our forces to sit here totally
defenseless

PRESIDENT

Commander we are on a peace mission The first peace man has known
in a thousand years

ON ZAC

Explosions charge the sky around him He takes another hit He
pales

A lone ship is coming under attack from the main force approaching

firing at our patrol

PRESIDENT

Firing at our patrol How do you explain that Baltar

ON THE LANDING DECK OF THE GALACTICA

Skyler is climbing hurriedly out of his ship
ATHENA

moves to him on the dead run

ATHENA

Skyler thank heavens youre all right

She tried to crush into his arms He is sympathetic but stoic and
in a hurry to report

SKYLER

Ive got to go back for Zac Its an ambush They jammed our
communicators You tell Commander Adama there were no base ships
Hell understand what Im saying

ATHENA

Skyler

SKYLER

Athena just listen and tell Adama that its more than just an attack
The Cylon base ships are missing That means theyre up to something
diabolical Now Ive got to go back for Zac

As he turns to charge away

ATHENA

You dont have to go back

Skyler spins around His tone is positive but his expression is
uncertain

SKYLER

You mean hes all right One of the other ships picked him up

Tears begin to roll down Athenas cheek

ATHENA

No

Skyler sucks in his breath and stares at Athena emotionlessly then
turns away as she cries

SKYLER

I guess I can give my report to Adama himself

He turns to move off

ATHENA

Your report Is that all you can say Zacs dead

Skyler looks back

SKYLER

Well probably all be dead soon

Skyler steels himself against the pain turns and exits up the metal
staircase

ON THE LANDING DECK

On Skyler as he enters the bridge of the Galactica Adama is quick to
move to him and embrace him Skyler tenses up

ADAMA

You didnt have any choice

yler pulls away

KYLER

ere were no base ships only attack craft Maybe a thousand
overing over Cimtar

e Colonel moves up

IGH

thousand You must be mistaken Captain Fighters couldnt function
is far from Cylon without base ships They dont carry enough fuel
e Captain looks off thoughtfully

KYLER

e picked up an empty tanker on our scanner Its my guess the Cylons
sed it to refuel for the attack after flying to that point from
erever their base ships are

e Commander ponders that as the Colonel shakes his head skeptically

HE SENHA PHA THXNYM

TIGH

Why operate that far from base ships when it isnt necessary They
would have been well out of our range at the old moon

A grim revelations descends across Adamas face

ADAMA

Unless it was more important that the base ships be someplace else
Get me the President

We read an ominous foreboding look in Commander Adamas eyes

ON THE CYLON BASE SHIPS

Three large circular aircraft hover in the sky above the planet
Caprica

IN THE LARGE CIRCULAR CHAMBER

lighted by very subdued indirect sources A door opens on a side and
two large armored men move in wearing Cylon scanning helmets They

fires raging all around The President looks on horrified as Adama
comes on a monitor

ADAMA

Mister President I request permission to leave the fleet Ive
reason to suspect our home planets may face imminent attack

The President takes these words like a death blow He suddenly leans
against a bridge wall

PRESIDENT

No Pray youre mistaken How could I have been so completely wrong
Ive led the entire human race to ruin

ADAMA

You didnt lead us to this disaster Mister President But we were
led

PRESIDENT

Baltar No Commander I dont believe it I wont

With that an explosion rips the command bridge open engulfing it in
flame

ON ADAMA

as the monitor reflects the inferno then goes blank

ADAMA

Mister President Mister President
All eyes swing from the monitor to the starfield where the flagship
can be seen cruising a thousand yards away its bridge aflame its
flight deck alive with fires Suddenly the entire ship bursts apart
disintegrating into a thousand torches hurdling through space For an
instant there is stunned silence on the bridge of the Galactica
then as other Cylon ships roar by firing at the Galactica Colonel
Tigh moves up

TIGH

Our long-range scanners have picked up Cylon base ships here here
and here putting them well within range of the planets Virgon
Sagitara and

Commander Adama Athena and Colonel Tigh look on as technicians plot
the course of the Galactica and enemy base ships on a large
translucent starfield map

ADAMA

Yes Caprica

The impact hits Athena

ADAMA

Helm bring us around Were withdrawing Colonel flank speed for
home

ATHENA

Father what are you doing

SKYLER

You cant leave our Warriors

ADAMA

(reluctantly)

We have to leave them to defend the fleet Those with enough fuel
left will catch up

ATHENA

And what about the others

TIGH

At the very least let us transmit our intentions Give them a chance
to conserve what fuel they can

ADAMA

No If we have any advantage left its surprise

a handsome young woman speaks to a camera from a garden spot just in
front of an all-glass building set within a shopping mall

LYRA

Just ordinary people going to and from work behaving not as if this
were the most significant day in all history but rather as they would
on any other day So far details of the armistice meetings going on
at this very moment on the Star Kobol are not coming in as hoped for
because of an unusual electrical storm blocking out all interstellar
communication However as soon as available you will see the first
pictures of what has been described as the most significant event
A loud explosion from far away thumps through in the background
People all around Orin suddenly turn and look pointing staring
some beginning to shout

LYRA
Excuse me something happened Perhaps some of you heard itan
explosion of some kind People are staring off in that direction

Lets see if we can

Lyra begins to move out across the garden camera going with her
getting jostled by a growing crowd

CAMERA POINT OF VIEW

there is another

Oh my Goda tremendous explosiontwo of them Are we getting
it on camera People are beginning to run in all directions

BRIDGE OFFICER

Commander the long-range scanners are picking up wave after wave of
small ships heading towards all of the inner planets

Everyone on the bridge stares helplessly

BACK IN THE MALL
on the surface of Caprice Lyra reacts to a fighter swinging low over
the city firing in her direction She looks all around for cover is
bumped and pushed as people scramble in all directions

LYRA
Its hopeless People are dying all around me I see a small
childrunning for hisLook out
Lyra suddenly throws down her microphonethe camera being hand-held
by an engineer swings around on her as she streaks towards a small
boy running with his dog from the path of a streaking attack fighter
Lyra dives pushing the child out of the path of the laser blast which
continues on up the street devastating her camera crew A second wave
of fighters screams by completing the destruction sending columns
and pillars of concrete crashing all around

ON THE RUBBLE

as Lyra attempts to dig her way out rising up with immediate concern
for the small form concealed beneath her

LYRA

Dont try to move

The small boy pokes his head up crying Lyra comforts him pulling
him to her

LYRA

Everythings going to be all right

BOXEY

Muffit Wheres Muffit

LYRA

Who

BOXEY

My daggit My daggit Where is he

LYRA

Your daggit Oh Im sure hes fine

Lyra swings her head around looking Suddenly her eyes fix on
something os

LYRAS POINT OF VIEW

A pillar lies broken amidst other fallen building material and
protruding from beneath the debris a small dog lying motionless not
breathing

ON LYRA AND BOXEY

Lyra turns Boxey around screening him from seeing the animal

LYRA

I think I saw him run this way Lets go look

BOXEY

I want Muffit Is he all right

Lyra holds the boy close to her

LYRA

Surehes all righteverything is all righteverything is going
to be just fine

She rocks the young lad in her arms pondering the hollow lie that
leaves her lips as she looks around the city which was proud and
stately only minutes ago

BACK ON THE GALACTICA BRIDGE As the high level satellite pictures
display the fire and aftermath of total and utter destruction of a
planet Commander Adama turns from the monitor in defeat Athena
appears almost comatose in a dream state

ATHENA

First Zac now this They trusted us to protect them

Adama attempts to draw her to him She pulls away

ATHENA

How could you have let it happen

As she runs from the bridge Adama looks to Skyler He returns a
stoic emotionless gaze

SKYLER

You had no choice

The two men momentarily share a common emotion void of any
satisfaction

ON ADAMA AND SKYLER

Suddenly both men are spared further agony by the excited intrusion
of a voice

BRIDGE OFFICER

Cylon base ships on long-range scannerlaunching to all outer
planets

All eyes swing to the scanners as pictures burst forth on all
screens each one displaying fighters sweeping in on bombing runs
TIGH

No hope Commander

The Commander sinks with each devastating image from the colonies and
turns to communications a hint of desperation in his voice

ADAMA

What about Sagitarias Perhaps theres still time to save

BRIDGE OFFICER

Sorry Commanderthe planet is in flames

The Commander pales seems almost on the verge of collapse

ADAMA

Prepare my shuttle craft

The Colonel looks at the Commander startled

TIGH

Shuttle craft

ADAMA

Im going down to the surface of Caprica

TIGH

Commander thats out of the question If the Cylon scanners should
pick you up

ADAMA

You proceed to rendezvous with the survivors of the fleet

SKYLER

Ill take you Father in my fighter Youre the last surviving member
of the Council If we run into a Cylon attack ship at least youll
have a chance

TIGH

As the man whod have to fill your shoes I insist on that Commander

ADAMA

Very well Make preparationsand should I not return

The Commander and Colonel extend hands clasping each others wrists
as they shake hands

SKYLER

You will

ON THE GALACTICA

as a single fighter roars from its launching crib and off across the
starfield On its departure the Galactica banks and heads off to
pursue its mission

ON THE GALACTICA BRIDGE

STARBUCKS VOICE

(over intercom)

Red leader onein troublein trouble

Colonel Tigh responds

TIGH

Surviving fighter ships rendezvousing Commander

ATHENA

We read you Red leader How can we assist you

ON STARBUCK IN HIS SHIP

Sparks are flying all over the cockpit as a piece of instrument panel
dangles from its mooring Starbuck struggles to keep the wires apart
and halt the dangerous electrical shorting while at the same time
maintaining his flight attitude He looks out the window

POINT OF VIEW - HIS PORTSIDE WING

The short stubby extension that sweeps out after blast-off and
maintains this attitude through landing is sweeping out and then back
into the aircraft intermittently

STARBUCK

Battle damage Power control circuits shot away Give me a systems
analyst on the line

ON ATHENA

ATHENA

I am on the line Starbuck Whats your condition

STARBUCK

This is no time from trainees Athena Im in real trouble

ATHENA

You will be if you keep talking like that Whats your fuel
STARBUCK

Dry

ATHENA

All rightrun the check with me Alpha circuit close and
alternating to left servo circuit

Starbuck reaches into the sparking circuit board dangling from beneath
his instrument panel He closes off a circuit switch

STARBUCK

Alpha circuit closed and alternating to left servo circuit No
response My throttles are still full open

ATHENA

Omega C circuit closed and alternating to Servo support circuit
STARBUCK

Alternating to Servo support circuit

Starbuck is perspiring now The throttle does not respond

STARBUCK

Does not respond

ATHENA

too is now beginning to perspire

TIGH

Bring him in full throttle Theres no choice

STARBUCK

I heard him Get everyone out of the way Im coming in hotready
or not

BRIDGE OFFICER

Youre cleared to land

STARBUCK

Roger I hope you guys arent counting off for neatness

BACK ON THE BRIDGE

BRIDGE OFFICER

Hell be coming in like a missile

TIGH

Clear the flight deck for an emergency landing

ON STARBUCK IN HIS SHIP

He starts sweating profusely

POINT OF VIEW -STARBUCKS

The rapidly approaching flight deck racing up closer closer

ON ATHENA

as she charges out of the elevator in time to see a plane coming in
Suddenly she is held back

DECK HAND

Stay backHe could lose it

ON THE SHIP

as it careens down the flight deck turning sideways and crabbing
towards the superstructure

ATHENA

breaks from the deck hands grip and charges off as we hear a long
screech followed by a resounding crash from os

ON STARBUCKS SHIP

impaled on the side of a wall as steam and smoke flood the area
Across the hangar beyond the ship small emergency vehicles race out
of pockets in the walls and towards the ship

ATHENA

is first to reach the ship as Starbuck flips back the canopy and
jumps down the side of the ship Athena reaches him throwing her arms
him

ATHENA

Starbuck are you all right

STARBUCK

For a guy who just had a whole fleet shot out from under him Im
fine

The support team comes pulling up

STARBUCK

Give her a good wash fellas

Starbuck streaks towards the elevators

ATHENA

Its been horrible

STARBUCK

Yeah You should have seen how we spent our day We managed to single-
handedly keep the Cylons off your necks while you took off on a little
cruise

They reach steps and begin to climb

ATHENA

Starbuck dont you know whats happened

STARBUCK

Sure I know what happened You should see this baby from the air

around
when she slips off across the sky Beautiful sight unless she
happens to be your base ship

ATHENA

The colonies are gone Starbuckall of them

STARBUCK

What are you talking about Gonewhatd they do pack up and sneak
away like the Galactica

ON THE BRIDGE

as Starbuck storms into the chamber where the mood is subdued and his
entrance goes unnoticed

BRIDGE OFFICER

ips are coming in on both decks sir

e Colonel leaves the map area

IGH

ats the count

RIDGE OFFICER

ixty-seven fighters in all sir Twenty-five of our own

IGH

ow many battlestars

ere is a pregnant pause

RIDGE OFFICER

BRIDGE OFFICER

Were the only surviving battlestar

TIGH

My God Make the pilots from the other ships as welcome as you
can

STARBUCK

Little late for that Colonel

All eyes swing to Starbuck moving in with Athena a few steps behind
him

STARBUCK

It was a toss-up whether those guys would land or send in a belly full
of torpedoes Unfortunately no one had any left

TIGH

Whats the meaning of this insubordination

ATHENA

He doesnt know what happened Colonel I dont think any of them
know

Suddenly two more pilots are on the flight bridge

STARBUCK

Know what That the old man turned and ran leaving a dozen of our
ships to run out of fuel

Boomer and Jolly come to a stop beside Starbuck

TIGH

Put the transmissions we monitored back on the scanners for our young
patriots

STARBUCK

If this is going to be a lecture on military protocol

SUDDENLY THE SCANNERS COME TO LIFE

Four at a time each displaying the attack bombing the confusion the
devastation of the colonies

SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON THE PILOTS FACES

as they are sobered and horrified by what they see

CLOSE ON SKYLER

aa a WHrHHDSEHHYN

as he stands on a hill His fighter ship a silent sentinel to his
back The glow of a myriad fires dance on his ashen face

POINT OF VIEW

The flames from thousands of buildings burn far off in the distance
SKYLER

turns as he hears what sounds like a mob approaching in the distance
ON A DOZEN TORCHES FAR OFF DOWN THE HILL

heading in the direction of the aircraftvoices shouting excitedly
desperately

SKYLER

turns and heads off taking camera towards a family dwelling Once a
handsome structure laid out in half circles now carved down the
middle by some unseen evil One half of the dwelling is charred
remnants

INSIDE THE DWELLING ON ADAMA
He is illuminated across the darkened room by a rectangular candle
with twelve wicks He stands by a wall covered with photographs of
himself his two sons and a daughter We recognize Athena Skyler and
a second son Zac A handsome woman is also pictured with the family
and alone in several beautiful portraits taking her from a girl of
seventeen to fifty years Tears well up in Adamas eyes as he takes

e oldest photo of his wife in hand

m sorry Ila I was never there when it mattered Never

e tears begin to stream down his cheeks as the memories of a
ousand lost moments and lost opportunities race through his mind
uddenly he turns to see Skyler standing across the room

AMA

didnt hear you come in I was just gathering a few remembrances
ou want this likeness of you and Zac

yler snaps back his mood hardening against the hurt

KYLER

lw)

ook there are crowds coming They probably saw our ship land
dama stiffens

ll be a few more minutes

yler turns to leave then seems to soften turning back

KYLER

laybe she wasnt here Maybe

e Commander looks at Skyler with finality

AMA

e was here

yler nods and slowly withdraws

OUTSIDE THE DWELLING - THE CITIZENS WITH TORCHES

have approached to within fifty yards of the sleek fighter ship Their
voices are pitched and angular as they stride down the gentle incline
towards Skyler who moves out to meet them warily gauging their
hostile cries
SANDELL

Where are they Wherere the rest of your fancy fliers
LOBE
Where were you lad when they were killing everyone in sight What
were you doing boy
As they close the gap to within a few feet of Skyler and seem bent on
taking him apart a womans voice calls out

nn HEnONWNWH PPA z DHNOKHPHYAHH RPS

LYRA

Wait

For a moment there is hesitation The mob parts as Lyra steps
forward holding a small boy by the hand

LYRA

Let him talk

She continues on out until she is face-to-face with Skyler

LYRA

Before they do what they will with you Id like to know where you
were Where were all of you We waitedwe watched and prayedbut
you never came

Skyler looks down at the small innocent face looking up from beside
Lyra a child with dirt and confusion in his innocent eyes

SKYLER

Most of us are dead

The crowd breaks into an undertone of awe

SKYLER

The fleet is all but destroyed

The crowd breaks into cries of despair and anguish

LYRA

But you are herewhere did you come from

SKYLER

The battlestar Galactica

LYRA

Survived

SKYLER

Yes

LYRA

And what of the President and the Council of the Twelveand the
other colonies Surely we can fight back We have the will and at
long last after hundreds of years we are unitedall twelve
colonies They cannot possibly defeat our combined strength

A voice from offstage commands their attention

ADAMA

We became as one too late

The group is stunned to find so imperious a figure as one of the
Council of the Twelve amongst them

LYRA

Commander Adama

LYRA

Miss Lyra

ADAMA

Then its true We are defeateddoomed

Skyler and the Commander exchange looks The little boy Boxey stares
up at Skyler admiringly

BOXEY

Can I ride in your ship Mister

Skyler bends down and picks him up Skyler looks at the lad then at
Adama pointedly

SKYLER

Fighter ships are no place for boys

LYRA

Theyre going to have to be if our people are going to survive
Adama turns and walks off to the edge of the bluff overlooking the
burning cities beyond Lyra moves up behind him beside Skyler who
is carrying the young child

LYRA

We are going to fight backwe cant simply give up

The Commander seems deep in thought as he looks out over the ruins
Then he turns and looks past Lyra and Skylerpast the boy

ADAMA

Yes we are going to fight back

A cry of bravado goes up from the torch-bearing mobcries of
satisfaction of frustration of vented anger

ADAMA

But not herenot nownot in the coloniesnot even in this star
system Let the word go forth to every man woman and child who has
survived this infamy Tell them to set sail at once in every assorted
vehicle that will carry them

SKYLER

There isnt time to arrange provision Father The Cylons will be
sending landing parties to eradicate the survivors If we could send
in our remaining fighters

ADAMA

No There are too many of them and too few of us There is a time to
fight and a time to withdrawto fight another day

SKYLER
But there is no way to board the entire population on the Galactica
And we have no troop carriers nothing that can make light speed
ADAMA
Well use what we do have Every inner-galactic passenger liner
freighter taxieven inner colony busesair taxisanything
that will carry our people into the stars

LYRA
And when they have gathered in the stars

ADAMA

We will lead themand protect themuntil they are strong again
The group facing the Commander turn exchanging curious looks Either
they are in the presence of a madman or a savior

In all two hundred and twenty ships representing every colony color

ON A CYLON BASE SHIP
hovering over Caprica
TWO CYLON WARSHIPS
approach the Cylon mother ship
INSIDE THE INNER CHAMBER
a side door opens and two Cylon warriors cross towards the center
pedestal with a human between them He is Baltar One of the two
sentries beside Baltar speaks

SENTRY

At your command

LEADER

Welcome Baltar You have done well

Baltar looks as if he is about to attack the Leaderobviously an
unwise move

BALTAR

I have done wellWhat have you done What of our bargain My colony
was to be spared

LEADER

The bargain was altered

BALTAR

How can you change one side of a bargain

LEADER

But there is no other side You have missed the entire point of the
war

Baltars resolve his anger is replaced by a creeping concern that

he has erred in his evaluation of the man before him

BALTAR

I dont know what you mean

LEADER

I mean there could be no dominion over the species so long as man
remained a power within the Universe It was man or the Alliance
There could be no compromise

BALTAR

But you have what you wantthe threat no longer existsI delivered
my end of the bargain My dominion was to be spared

LEADER

There can be only one dominionone power one authoritythere
must be no exceptions

BALTAR

But I have no ambitions against you

LEADER

Could you think me so foolish as to trust a man who would see his own
race destroyed

BALTAR

Not destroyed subjugatedunder me

LEADER

There can be no survivors So long as one human remains alive the
Alliance is threatened

BALTAR

Surely you dont mean me
LEADER

We thank you for your help Baltar Your time is at an end

The Leader nods and the two ominous sentries on either side of Baltar
lift him from the floor one on each arm and begin to take him away
BALTAR

Noyou cantyou still need me

ON THE LEADER

LEADER

Send the flight leader in

ON THE DOOR

A sentry enters and stands aside as the flight leader enters He moves
directly to the center of the room

FLIGHT LEADER

At your command

LEADER

Report on the final assault on the human colonies

FLIGHT LEADER

The ships all report similar circumstances The initial attack was so
effective there were no survivors

LEADER

(incredulously)

No survivors On any of the twelve colonies

FLIGHT LEADER

That is correct Imperious Leader

Slowly push into the Imperious Leaders knowing gaze

ON THE RAG TAG FLEET

Countless ships of every description scattered across the sky behind
the lone survivor of the Colonial Fleet We slowly push into the

lead vehicle and see its name

GALACTICA

IN A LARGE COUNCIL CHAMBER

Commander Adama stands before a large seated gathering the starfield
to his back

ADAMA

Long long agowhether thousand or millions of year is
unimportantour recorded history tells us that we descended from a
mother civilization a race that set out into the universe to
establish colonies Those of us here now represent every known
surviving colony save one A sister world far out in the universe
only remembered to us through ancient writings It is my intention to
seek out that remaining colony that last outpost of humanity in the
universe A civilization like our own to ask their help in
rebuildingand perhaps to warn them of an evil Alliance and their
intention to eradicate all mankind
LIEUTENANT STARBUCK

rises to his feet All around him are other fighter pilots

ADAMA

Lieutenant Starbuck you have a question

STARBUCK

Yes sir If were talking about the same colony I remember reading
about it in ancient mythology I dont think anybody even knows where
it is and if our own ship is any indication we barely have enough
fuel to get out of this galaxy

Starbuck sits as a surge of agreement sweeps through the room

ADAMA

A very good point It will be our plan to find a fuel source and
extended provisions before we leave the star system

Colonel Tigh rises to his feet

TIGH

Commander I feel I speak for the vast majority when I say this is
hardly a fleet of sturdy well-equipped soldiers up to battling the
universe Most of these people barely got away with their lives
Theyre emotionally and physically unprepared for the kind of journey
you propose

The crowd seems to agree as Skyler is now on his feet as well
SKYLER

And less than a third of the ships were escorting can make light
speed It could take us generations to find this colony

ADAMA

And well find it because we have no choice If we stay in this star
system the Alliance will find us Well travel only as fast as our
slowest ship Well be only as strong as our weakest brother We are
the only surviving battlestar but the combined pilots that survived
ours and the other ships are the best in all the universe They are
up to the task of protecting each and every one of you

LYRA

rises to her feet We recognize her as the newswoman from Caprica
LYRA

Commander Adamaforgive the void in my education but star
mythology was never my best subject This thirteenth colony

this other worldwhere is it What is it called

Adama takes a long pause as he scans the audience then turns to the
starfield and gazes at it like a man searching the horizon for a
glimpse of a sail beyond a sea

ADAMA

I cannot tell you that I know precisely where it isbut it lies
beyond this star system in a galaxy like our own As for the planets
name

Adama looks back to the expectant throng

ADAMA

It is called Earth

A long beat as excitement builds through the congregation

END OF HOUR ONE

HOUR TWO

FADE IN

ON THE GALACTICA

maneuvering ahead of the rag tag fleet

IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM

Adama stands before a translucent starmap addressing a council of
elders

ADAMA

Our course while indirect and arduous has successfully brought us
to the outermost reaches of the star system without encountering
Cylon patrols If we can hold out for another eight or nine centons
we can reach the planet Carillon

Adama turns and moves back to face the main body

ADAMA

There hopefully we can find fuel water and prepare fresh stores
of food

ON ANTON

ANTON

Hopefully My dear Commander there is not one amongst us who is not
grateful beyond words for your vision and resourcefulness in saving
us all from certain death Are we now to throw it all away
Anton rises

ANTON

As of this moment we face a crisis no less lethal than the Cylon war
machine I would rather see my loved ones extinguished in the micron
flash of a Cylon cannon than drift in fuelless vehicles while
starvation dehydration and suffocation agonize us one by one

ADAMA

Anton it was hardly possible to adequately prepare ourselves for the
journey weve had to undertake We had to leave We had no choice
Anton moves to the map

ANTON

But we have a choice now We can stop here on Borallus We know that
everything we need is herefood water fuel

There are waves of approval throughout the room

ADAMA

And undoubtedly a Cylon task force

A murmur races through the room

ADAMA

It is the most logical place for us to stop Precisely why I believe
it would be fatal to do so

ANTON

Possibly fatal Is it not surely fatal to continue towards Carillon
Colonel Tigh rises

TIGH

Commanderthe situation has reached crisis levels Rations have
already been cut by two-thirds How much more can we conserve

ADAMA

As much as we have to to reach Carillon It is our only hope

ANTON

The Cylons will be looking even unto those far reaches

ADAMA

There is a path here through the Nova of Madagon Not patrolled and
a savings of some two centons in reaching Carillon

A gasp is heard throughout the council as Adama points to a course
through the starfield

ANTON

Commander while I may not be a military expert even I know that the
Cylons avoid patrolling that area by mining it to make passage
impossible

ADAMA

Not impossible We will do it We have no other choice

ON THE BODY OF ELDERS

Their faces are grim

ON A CYLON BASE SHIP

hanging ominously in the sky

INSIDE THE INNER CHAMBER

two Cylon Centurians enter with Baltar between them Baltar is a
different man than the one who strode arrogantly before the Imperious
one

ON THE IMPERIOUS LEADER

CENTURIAN

By your command

LEADER

The people of Cylon wish to offer you an opportunity to serve Baltar
Baltar searches for deception in the Leaders words but he is too
resigned to death to challenge the unexpected words

BALTAR
To serve

LEADER

It appears that a small band of refugee humans eluded the Alliance
Baltar seems to stand a little taller

BALTAR
I tried to forewarn you

The Centurians hurl Baltar to the flood and hold staffs against the
back of his head
LEADER

I offer you life and you question my judgment Dangerous
BALTAR
raises his head slightly

BALTAR

Kill me

The Imperious Leader stares at Baltar The Centurians waiting for a
sign to kill him

LEADER

Let him rise

The Centurians remove their staffs Baltar climbs to his feet
LEADER

I sense a bargain

BALTAR

We bargained before and it left me a dead man This time I will have
my reward before I serve you

LEADER

The entire Alliance serves me Why do I need you

BALTAR

Why do you spare me Because you fear man You do not understand him
When your forces had taken and put the entire nation of Tucana into
slavery man was there to break the chains When you chose to dominate
the people of Gaelon man was there to make the Galics strong to help
them seek their own destiny The Cylon is content to serve Man is
born to lead But I can succeed where you have failed

LEADER

What is your bargain

BALTAR

When I find the survivors of the coloniesthey are mine

LEADER

And how to you propose to protect this bargain

BALTAR

There are those who will follow meaway from your influenceaway

from your interests

LEADER

All the stars interest me

BALTAR

You can have no reign on tyranny There is room for all
LEADER

You appear as a man but you think like a Cylon
BALTAR

The better to serve you while serving myself
LEADER

You will need Centurians

BALTAR

Two will be adequate

LEADER

Baltar looks from the Centurian on his left to the Centurian on his
right

BALTAR

These two

LEADER

Your arrogance will destroy you

BALTAR

I would rather die by my own hand than yours

LEADER

So be itthey are yours

Baltar smiles nods and turns

BALTAR

Come along boys

As Baltar moves off the Centurians stand stoically awaiting
instructions from the Imperious Leader

LEADER

Go with himServe me

CENTURIAN

By your order

They turn and move off as we close into a very troubled Imperious
Leader

ON THE RAG TAG FLEET

sailing through the sky at a slow pace

ON AN ANTIQUATED VEHICLE

pushing in to establish the lettering on its side

COLONIAL MOVERS

WE MOVE ANYWHERE

INSIDE AN ENGINE AREA

Skyler crawls out from an access area beneath some mechanical gear
is hands and face soiled as his Captain markings on his shoulders are
the only indications of military rank He turns to a tool kit to put
away some instruments taking us to an older man

JENSING

I understand two other ships have already broken down

SKYLER

And twenty-two have run out of fuel

Skyler closes his tool his and riseslooking grim

JENSING

Its serious

Skyler looks at the man whose face bears the emotional scars of too
many recent disasters

SKYLER

Until we stop for materials or find minerals to make our own I just
cant repair itand youll never be able to keep up with the fleet
like it is

JENSING

But what will we do

SKYLER

Well have to transfer everyone off of this ship to one of the others
How many people on board

A beautiful young lady enters

LYRA

Twenty-nine

Skyler turns and smiles

SKYLER

Well a celebrity I would have thought you could have pulled a little
space on one of the plush passenger liners

LYRA
I have no interest in pulling space This ship was assigned to me
JENSING

Shes being charitable We asked her if shed come with us to see if
she could help us with the little boy

SKYLER

Little boy

LYRA

You remember the child found in the bombing The Jensings lived in the
same module as Boxeys parents who were killed in the first wave
JENSING

He doesnt sleep and he doesnt eateven emergency rations In fact
Lyra is the only one hell even talk to

LYRA

Thats about all I can get him to do He lost a little daggit which
apparently meant everything to him I thought you might help

SKYLER

If he wont eat for you I dont know what I can do

LYRA

He seemed to spark a little when you picked him up on Caprica I got
the feeling you were good with children

SKYLER

(introspectively)

I grew up with a kid brother

IN A NARROW COMPANIONWAY

off of which countless cubicles have been formed as living quarters in
the hold of this cargo vessel Skyler looks into the faces and lives
of the refugees occupying the rooms which are open partially open
and in a few cases entirely curtained off with makeshift draperies
They arrive at a room which is draped shut There is only a night
light on inside Skyler looks at Lyra She gestures inside Skyler
reaches into his back pocket and withdraws his military cap with its
scrambled eggs and insignia of the Colonial Warriors He enters
INSIDE A TINY CUBICLE

Spartan in its furnishings the night light illuminates the face of a
young boy who lies staring at the ceilingwide awake

SKYLER

Excuse meI hope Im not interrupting anything

Boxeys eyes widen

SKYLER

Im in charge of finding young men to try out as future fighter
pilots Your name is Boxey correct

BOXEY

Uh-huh

Skyler nods and moves to the bed and crouches beside it

SKYLER

Good Ive been looking all over for you You should have made contact
with the Commander You know were very short on pilots

BOXEY

Im too little to be a pilot

SKYLER

Oh sure right now but how long do you think it takes to become a
full Colonial Warrior

BOXEY

I dont know

SKYLER

You have to start when youre very small or you wont get these until
you have gray hair
Boxey lifts his head to see what Skyler is pointing to on his
shoulders The young lads eyes show their first glimmer of interest
as they see Captains emblems

SKYLER

You like them

Then as quickly as the interest appeared it vanishes and the youth
withdraws to his pillow

BOXEY

I want Muffit

SKYLER

Well I dont know There isnt much room for a daggit in a fighter
plane

BOXEY

Hes gone He ran away

SKYLER

Well maybe we can find one of Muffits friends

OXEY

ere are no daggitsI asked

yler steals a helpless look at Lyra who looks back both
ppreciatively and sympathetically

KYLER

Ill tell you what

er removes an emblem from his shoulder and places it on Boxeys
ight clothes

KYLER

Colonial Warrior First Level you are entitled to the first daggit
at comes along

yler rises and starts out of the room then hesitates at the door
KYLER

t only on the condition that you get your rest eat all of your
rimaries and stop chasing girls Good night Officer

yler salutes and exits with Lyra Behind them Boxey steals a peek
t the emblem on his pajamas He clutches it in his hand and stares
t the darkened ceiling as we move to see the far off look which
indows the confused world of a six year old boy

N THE CORRIDOR

yler waits as Lyra moves up to him

yler steps away

SKYLER

LYRA

e livery ship Three large circular compartments connected by long
arrow metal corridors Skyler walks with Starbuck down a corridor
TARBUCK

dont think I can help you Skyler Other than fixing the landing
ervos on this livery machine the only thing I know about livestock
ich includes daggits is that theyve run out of food to feed them
et me show you

ey have entered one of the large circular pods taking us to a ring
f animals all facing into a central feeding device The animals are
n pairs each pair representing a different species Starbuck leads
yler to one of the stalls where we find two unicorns one lying on
its side

SKYLER

How long has he been like that

STARBUCK

He collapsed last night just after I was brought on board You know
unicorns are very monogamous His ladys in foal They think hes
been letting her have his share of the food ration If we could have
stopped at Borallus

Skyler storms away

SKYLER

We couldnt stop The Cylons would have been therewaiting
STARBUCK

Well when these animals are gone theyre gone Well just have to

NQrREOHHFEZEHYHNSD A

accept the fact that generations will grow up without ever having
seen a unicorn or a tagonor a

SKYLER

There wouldnt have been any generations of anything if wed stopped
I would have made the same decision as my father

Starbuck moves after Skyler

STARBUCK

Okayokayits just rough to have to watch them slip away one at
a time

SKYLER

Ill tell you whats roughWeve got a little boy in the same
condition Are you sure no one brought any daggits along someplace in
this whole fleet

STARBUCK

No Were both out of luckI already checked

SKYLER

Both out of luck You checked for daggits Why

STARBUCK

Daggit racing

SKYLER

What

STARBUCK

Whats one of the most awful things that can happen to people ona
long voyage

SKYLER

They die

STARBUCK

Not that awful Im talking about things to do for excitement
Skylers interest plunges into disgust

SKYLER

Fifty million Cylons chasing us all over the starsour ships are
falling aparttheres nothing to eatand youre worried about
excitement
STARBUCK

Well when you put it like thatAnyway I got the idea before it
began to look like we werent going to make it at all

SKYLER
Were going to make itthe animals too
STARBUCK
Tell him
Starbuck and Skyler have arrived at a droid whose front is open
exposing its workings There are tools in front of the machine
suggesting that Starbuck has been working on it

STARBUCK
Hows it going this morning Zeus

A slightly effete but benevolent voice responds

ZEUS

Not well All species receiving inadequate food supplements to
survive the voyage to the planet Carillon

STARBUCK

Youre wrong Zeus Commander Adama has just decided to take a chance
through the Nova of Madagon Thatll cut two centons off of the
journey

ZEUS

The Nova of Madegon is mined by the Alliance The percentile risk of
successfully traversing the strait makes it statistically impossible
STARBUCK

Is that right
ZEUS

Yes thats right
STARBUCK

Thank you

ZEUS

Thank you
STARBUCK

Thank you

ZEUS

Thank you
Starbuck shakes his head
STARBUCK

Idiot

ZEUS

I beg your pardon

Now its Skylers turn to react His face lights up He too has seen
the light

SKYLER

Starbuckthats the answerYouve saved a life

STARBUCK

What

SKYLER

Never mindThanksI owe you one

Skyler turns and hustles out Starbuck looks after him

STARBUCK

Malnutritionits getting to everyone All right Zeus now we have
to reprogram some of your circuits for landing on a planet Do you
understand

ZEUS

Why did you call me an idiot

STARBUCK

Oh for crying out loud
ON A STARFIELD

so bright it defies the unprotected eye to scan it

ON TWO PILOTS IN THE BRIEFING ROOM

Starbuck and Skyler viewing a monitor

ADAMA

The Nova of Madegon is not a Nova at all but a starfield so bright
your cockpits will be sealed to prevent blindness You will navigate
by scanner and sweep everything out of your path with turbolasers
Any questions

STARBUCK

Yes sir Would this be an appropriate time for me to take my sick
leave

A small nervous laugh Adama smiles the longest and seems to take his
time answering the quip

ADAMA

It would but request denied I didnt arrive at you two to lead us
through without a great deal of anguish If it will do any good let
me assure you that should you failno one will survive Therefore
you have the advantage of controlling your own fate The rest of us
must sit in anticipation of your skill

Skyler rises

SKYLER

Or lack thereof

IN AN OUTER CORRIDOR

Adama exits a room and is accosted by Athena Adama does not stop
ATHENA

FatherI cant believe youre doing this Why couldnt you have
listened to the others We should have stopped at Borallus We
wouldnt have to be taking this awful chance with their lives
Adama stops and looks at Athena

ADAMA

Whose lives

ATHENA

Starbucks and Skylers

A knowing look crosses Adamas face

ADAMA

You place Lieutenant Starbucks name ahead of your brothers
Curious

She turns away

ADAMA

And here Im supposed to be all-knowing

ATHENA

I didnt know myself until I heard he was going Its all so
hopelessIf they survive this if any of us surviveWhat next
How long before we find Earth

ADAMA

Perhaps never

ATHENA

Thats what I was thinking Father We could grow old waiting I
mean we may never have the chanceto

ADAMA

To get married and have children and a home

ATHENA

Yes

ADAMA

Well I think its premature for you to be worrying about old age I
on the other hand ought to give a great deal of thought to this
voyageIf it should go on and on

ATHENA

But you have to lead them Youre all thats left

ADAMA

No youre leftand Skyler and Lieutenant Starbuck and Colonel Tigh
andwell so many more good people Thats why the journey is worth

any sacrifice There are so many people worth saving and beginning
again

Athena hugs her father

ATHENA

Im sorry if I spoke out of turn beforeIve never faced death
before

ADAMA

You faced senseless killing as you should have with horror Thats
the difference between humans and the Alliance We dont waste life
we only risk it when there is no other choiceas in this case where
the very survival of the human race may ride on three young men
ON SKYLER

in his cockpit

SKYLER

Ready

ON STARBUCK

in his cockpit

STARBUCK

Im not readyBut lets get it over with anyway

ADAMA ON THE BRIDGE

ADAMA

Launch

ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE GALACTICAS LAUNCHING TUBES

as two ships blast into space

ON THE BRIDGE

TIGH

Nova starfield ahead sir

Adama says a silent prayer

ON TWO COLONIAL FIGHTERS

sweeping through space and approaching a bright field of light
INSIDE SKYLERS COCKPIT

SKYLER

I may not be able to see anything but its sure getting hot You
picking up the field on your scanner

STARBUCK

STARBUCK

Negativemy scanners burning up

SKYLERS VOICE

I was afraid of that Its too bright for the scanner

STARBUCK

And a little too late to turn back Id say What do we do
SKYLERS VOICE

Only one thing I can think ofhold positions and blast away
STARBUCK

What if we miss a mine

SKYLERS VOICE

One of us will be the first to know it Lets go

ON THE COLONIAL FIGHTERS

as the two sleek ships angle through the brightly-lighted starfield
firing everything they have

ON THE MINEFIELD
as mine after mine detonates

ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA

a tense crew watches the scanners Suddenly a cheer goes up

TIGH

Its working Commander Theyre clearing a path a hundred maxims
wide

ATHENA

Now thats precision flying Starbuck really knows what hes doing
ON STARBUCK

STARBUCK

Are we hitting anything I cant see a blessed thing

SKYLER

Be hanged if I knowbut its cooling offI believe we made it
STARBUCK

Yaaaahooooooo

ON A PLANET

suspended in space

ADAMAS VOICE

The planet Carillon

IN THE ASSEMBLY ROOM

from which the Planet Carillon is clearly visible through the window
to space

ADAMA

Landing operations will begin at once

Adama turns to address the gathering of military officers

ADAMA

Our mineral scanners have located what we believe is the approximate
site of the old mining expedition Captain Skyler will lead a military
sortie to the surface

SKYLER

Will any civilian personnel be allowed to land

ADAMA

Only those responsible for the farming operation We will make
exceptions only for extreme cases medical or otherwise

IN A CORRIDOR ABOARD THE MOVING VAN

Lyra moves along with Skyler

LYRA

Still wont eatdoesnt sleep Commander Adama even granted
permission for him to go down onto Carillon and help care for the
livestock It would do him a world of good

SKYLER

I think I have something thatll interest him

IN A MAINTENANCE LABORATORY

in which we find a row of droids staring at us WIDEN to see Doctor
Wilker leaving a bench at which a scope is connected to a droid and
sending out pulses which make a hand function up and down The os
sound of a door opening automatically brings the Doctor around
SKYLER LYRA AND BOXEY

enter Doctor Wilker leaves his bench and walks up to greet them
WILKER

Ah Captain Skyler Right on time Weve been expecting you Is this
the young officer whos been put in charge of the new project
Skyler swings a look down to Boxey who is now half-hiding behind him
SKYLER

Well I havent had time to fully discuss the project with him Its
our hope that hell accept

Boxey pulls on Skylers leg Skyler looks down
BOXEY

(whispered)

I want to go back to my cubicle

SKYLER

Boxey this is a military order We have to at least hear the Doctor
out Tell us more about the project Doctor

WILKER

Well as you know we will soon be landing on various alien planets
Its important that we be safe Ordinarily wed have trained daggits
to stand watch at night when our Warriors are asleep in their
encampments but we dont have any daggits So we had to see what
we could come up with Well call the first one Muffit Two

Boxey looks up at Skyler

BOXEY

Whatd he say

SKYLER

I didnt really get it all Doctor Maybe youd better show us
WILKER

Right Oh Lanzer

A young man moves from the back of the lab holding something in his
arms It is large and friendly-looking It has curly hair implanted
all over it and as Lanzer puts it down on the ground it begins to
bark in a high-pitched friendly tone and move towards Boxey When it
gets there it stops Its tongue comes out it begins to pant and
its tail wags frantically from where it protrudes through a hole at
the back of the droids silver skin

WILKER

Naturally the first one will have to be looked after very carefully
Boxey stares at the small droid incredulously

BOXEY

Thats not Muffit Its not even a real daggit

WILKER

No but it can learn to be like a real one Its very smart If you
would help us hell be even smarter

Boxey continues to stare at the daggit The daggit in turn continues
to pant

BOXEY

Stop that

The daggit stops panting and cocks its head quizzically

BOXEY

begins to show the hint of a smile He turns and takes a step away
from the small droid The droid stares Boxey moves a few more feet
then moves off down the corridor The daggit rises and follows after
him

DOCTOR WILKER

turns to Lyra and Skyler

WILKER

(sotto)

We used the image of Boxey you gave us to train the droid to respond
to him

ON BOXEY

as he stops at the end of the corridor and turns to look at the
daggit He opens his arms The small droid moves forward sits up on
his hind legs and puts his paws on Boxeys small chest Boxey turns
his cheek against the small companion and smiles back up the corridor
at Lyra and Skyler and the Doctor It is love at first sight

ON SKYLER LYRA AND WILKER
SKYLER

Thats one I owe you Doc

He smiles

WILKER

Any time

As he leaves Lyra turns to Skyler with a warmth she hasnt felt
since before the holocaustwhen the world turned dark

LYRA

Thats one I owe you Skyler

SKYLER

Any time

ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON

Pushing in as we see colonial fighters streaking close over its
surface

STARBUCK

Surface cleared to land

ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA

ADAMA

Proceed to land the livery ships

ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON

as he livery ships soar by on their way to the surface

INSIDE THE CYLON BASE SHIP IN THE INNER CHAMBER

on the Imperious Leader

LEADER

It has been seven centons and not one word of the humans What have
you to say Baltar

Baltar stands before the Leader confident and illusive

BALTAR

Their doom is imminent

LEADER

You know where they are

BALTAR

I know where they will be

Baltar smiles confidently and turns to leave

LEADER

I have not dismissed you

Baltar stopslooks back

BALTAR

You want themThen I must go

LEADER

You know that when you have found them you will yet have to deal
with me for your arrogance

BALTAR

Yesbut this time I will be prepared

As Baltar turns and exits we push in on the Imperious Leader his
hatred for Baltar growing with every centon

ON STARBUCK BOOMER SKYLER AND JOLLY

standing on the surface of Carillon their fighter ships in the
background It is not day it is not night An odd illumination from
two moons gives the planet a midnight sun effect

BOOMER

I wonder what its like in the daytime

SKYLER

This is the daytime

STARBUCK

Lovely I cant imagine why it isnt overpopulated

SKYLER
My scanner reads life forms beyond that hill Either its some high-
energy-yielding substance or they left some kind of caretaker
operation behind when they abandoned this place Starbuck and Boomer
you take the shuttle and check it out Jolly you go to work on the
livery detail with your squadron Ill use mine to start checking out
is area for signs of the old mine Everybody sync your chronometers
want a check in every four millicentons on the security frequency
nderstood

veryone nods and pressed their wrist chronometers which emit random
ut-of-sync tones at odd intervals at first then come into sync so
at in effect we hear a pattern of steady rhythmic pulses

KYLER
ets go
e men all turn and head off in varying directions As they do we
an and move into one of many formations in the area that look like
e edge of a crater or giant ant hill or
REVERSE ANGLE

To Starbuck and Boomer moving off we are looking down the sights of
a strange-looking weapon Suddenly a hand moves in and pushes the
barrel down

CLOSE ON TWO SMALL CREATURES
They are insect-like approximately five feet tall large bulbous
eyes and four arms Seetol turns and nods taking camera to a third
creature who also carries a weapon with two hands and turns to work

a machine device with a third and fourth hand A faint whine can be
heard and the three creatures slowly begin to submerge down into the
crater

ON A SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAY

the pod appears in a cell-like opening The three creatures step off
One remains at the elevator-like structure the other two move off
down the passage which is alive with a pulsating golden light coming
from the cell-like panels

ON ANOTHER CELL-LIKE OPENING

As the two creatures move up a passageway towards it They arrive and
we pan with them taking camera to an immense chamber deep beneath the
earth

THE MINE

is a giant beehive-like structure with countless levels and
honeycomb-like compartments We ca see workers busily poking at walls
and withdrawing ore which is in turn placed in small vehicles which
other workers are maneuvering throughout the multicorridored structure
INSIDE A CHOSEN CHAMBER

Very plush A creature sits on a cushioned floor surrounded by slaves
serving all manners of personal needs from playing a sitar anda
bees hum pruning or manicuring two of the chosen creatures limbs
and providing some kind of smoking device for occasional puffs
SEETOL

enters

SEETOL

They have come

The voice is that of a girlsoft and pleasant The next voice is
that of the Queen of the hivedeeper just as soft but infinitely
more refined

LOTAY

Dont disturb them It will only stir them up Theyll be perfectly
harmless unless angered or frightened

Seetol nods bows and withdraws as Lotay draws on the strange pipe

foreground

ON SKYLER

as he points out a meadow area bordered on all sides by short rocky
hills Jensing looks on with several other farmer

SKYLER

Well use nitrogen injection in that area It looks level enough that
we wont have to bring down soil movers

e ranchers nod and move off as Boomer and Jolly come running up
OLLY

aptain we arent alone on this planet Youd better come right away
yler gives Jolly a worried look and follows after him

GREENBEAN

ith his sidearm in hand his shaking hand extended in front of him
ith the weight and fate of his people dispersed on his nervous face
yler and Jolly charge up

REENBEAN

o doubt about it Captain Someones here besides up Look at that
yler swings his look over to some rocks He sees nothing at first
en looks down and sees a snarling face It is Muffit Two

KYLER

ll right Ensign Ill handle it Put up your weapon

yler moves forward as Greenbean and Jolly watch warily

KYLER

ome on Muffyhere boy

e robot dog prances out from behind the rocks his tail wagging
yler bends down and pats the droid on the head

KYLER

e droid takes off towards the livery ships

KYLER

ts obvious you guys havent boned up in your manual on dealing with
atives on friendly planets

yler turns and moves off leaving Greenbean and Jolly in confusion
OMEPLACE ELSE ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON

over the rocky crest of a hill and looks down His face suddenly
reflects an awesome find

STARBUCK

Boomer

ON BOOMER

climbing up to the crest over jagged rocks

BOOMER

Yeahyeahwhat is it now

STARBUCK

(stunned)

You arent going to believe this Boomer

Boomer nears the top

BOOMER

Feeling is believing

STARBUCK

(dazzled)

No I mean really

Boomer reaches the crest and looks His mouth falls open

I dont believe it

POINT OF VIEW - PARADEESE de FESTIVE

Far down a steep rocky incline within the walls of a canyon a
carnival of color and lights and spherical glass set amidst greenery
and pools of water in a narrow valley of cliffs People and creatures
come and go amidst laughter and song

BOOMER AND STARBUCK

exchange blank stares

BOOMER

What is it

Starbuck shakes his head dumbfounded

STARBUCK

I dont know

Starbuck rises up drawing his sidearm and carefully starts down the
steep incline

ACROSS A CLEARING AMIDST THE POOLS OF WATER AND GARDENS

creatures and people move up and down the paths laughing gaily
Beyond them Starbuck and Boomer appear still completely disoriented
STARBUCK

It sure is prettyand it sure sounds friendly

A scream from os They wheel around

A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN

is staring at Starbuck and Boomer

WOMAN

Dont shoot What do you want

Starbuck embarrassingly looks at the weapon in his hand and quickly
puts it away smiling

STARBUCK

I mean no harm Youre from Taura
WOMAN

Yes Im a Taurus Howd you know that
STARBUCK

The dialectWhat is thisWhat are you doing here

WOMAN

What am I doing here What are you doing here Why are Colonial
Warriors sneaking around a resort with their weapons drawn Everything
is perfectly legal

Starbuck and Boomer exchange looks

WOMAN

Isnt it

STARBUCK

Would you mind telling us how you got here

WOMAN

On the bus

Another exchange of looks between Starbuck and Boomer

BOOMER

Mustve been sniffing plant vapors

STARBUCK

Would you tell us about this bus

WOMAN

It was all handled through my travel agent This place is fabulous
I just cant believe they can give you all this for so little
money

(she hurriedly starts to open her purse)

Look I won over a thousand cubits

Her purse burgeons with gold

STARBUCK

You won those cubitshere
WOMAN

In there sureLook they said it was all legal so if it isnt
youd better take on the whole star system because everyone is doing
it Look Im late Talk about meeting people they werent kidding
Were going on a moonlight cruise Two moons How can you go wrong
She giggles and hurries off Boomer looks after her

BOOMER

I dont get it How cut off can they be She didnt act like shed
even heard about the war

STARBUCK

Theres something even more peculiar Why havent we heard about this
place

BOOMER

I suppose you know every gambling den in our star system

Starbuck slowly turns to look at Boomer Boomer nods

BOOMER
Youre right If theres a game going on you know about it
Starbuck turns and starts moving towards the lavish sphere
STARBUCK
But this isnt back room cards This is the biggest splash Ive seen
outside of Orion

Starbuck stops in his tracks and looks at Boomer as if seeing a light
flashing
STARBUCK
Which colony did the mining exploration on this planet

The light begins to glow for Boomer

BOOMER

Orion

STARBUCK

Count Baltars private little empire It was his engineers that
reported back to the Colonies that mining on this planet was
financially unfeasible

BOOMER

So he sets up a gambling resort Why Why put something like this
together and keep it a secret

STARBUCK

To avoid paying Colonial taxeshis share of the war

BOOMER

Yeah but if you dont tell anyone about a place like this you dont
do any business

STARBUCK

Does this place look empty

BOOMER

It just doesnt make any sense

STARBUCK

Itll make sense when we ask the right questions

INSIDE THE GIANT SPHERE

a circus of gambling games attractive females humanoid and extra-
terrestrial A lovely feline-looking cocktail waitress moves up to
Starbuck just inside the entrance She is dressed very modestly
revealing little but the shape of four handsome breasts and a furry
tail which removes a soiled glass from a chrome railing as she
extends a tray to Starbuck

STARBUCK

Nothank you

She moves off as Boomer moves up his eyes on the waitress

STARBUCK

Did you see that tail

BOOMER

Sure did

A scream goes up from a gaming table nearby Starbuck and Boomer take
a look As they do a cry of joy goes up a few feet awayand another
further across the room

STARBUCK
The odds must be incredible here People are winning a fortune
BOOMER
And they are obviously well fed Lets get a hold of whoevers in
charge and see about getting some food back to the fleet
STARBUCK
Hold itslow downThe last thing these people may want to find is
a Battlestar sitting on their front door

BOOMER
Then you think this set-up is illegal

STARBUCK

It wasnt exactly listed in the Colonial Concordance of places to
gothings to do

Boomer starts looking around a little more nervously

BOOMER

Then they may not be too happy to see us either

STARBUCK

Ive never been in a crooked gambling den that didnt depend on
military pay vouchers to keep their doors open

Suddenly a pit boss is on them

PIT BOSS

Welcome gentlemen Is that an emblem of the Colonial Fleet that I
see

STARBUCK

Yesit is

PIT BOSS

I didnt realize they were in the area

STARBUCK

As a matter of fact were kind of here on our own

PIT BOSS

Little out of the way arent you

BOOMER

Secret mission

STARBUCK

He likes to be dramatic Just a reconnaissance flightsee that the
armistice is being observed

The ensuing moment seems like an eternity to Boomer and Starbuck Does
the pit boss seem to be grinning at their naive lie or is he being
genuinely hospitable

PIT BOSS

How worthyand how fortunate to have you with us Consider
yourselves guests of the establishment Food and drink are on the
house

The pit boss smiles once again and moves off

BOOMER

Well how do you feel now sport We have the run of the place while
our people are starving to death and itll be at least two centons
before we can raise crops

STARBUCK

What did you expect me to do ask the guy for twenty thousand quantums
of food for a couple of straggler pilots on a reconnaissance flight

BOOMER

Maybe we could kinda confide in him

STARBUCK

Boomer until we know who these people are just keep in mind itll
only take one informer to have the whole Cylon war machine on its way
BOOMER

So what do we do Weve got to get fuel and food back to the ships
STARBUCK

First thing we do is check in with the fleet and tell em what weve
found Meanwhile Ill try to find out whos behind this place How
many cubits do you have with you

BOOMER

Cubits There are people back in our fleet half-starved and youre
going to gamble

STARBUCK

Boomer this time its in the line of duty Weve got to start asking
some questions but carefully very carefully Now gocheck in
BOOMER

All right but youd better make this lastthats all there is
Boomer drops three cubits into Starbucks hand

ON A HI-LO TABLE

Three people are seated at what might be a space-age blackjack game
Starbuck heads for an open chair beside a woman who but for a few
pounds might be extremely attractive The other two at the table are
male both approaching obesity

STARBUCK
This chair taken

The girl eyes Starbuck appraisingly She likes what she sees

LORNA

Well The fleets inSit down

(She checks his shoulders for an insignia looks impressed)
Lieutenantyouve come to a lucky table

STARBUCK

That right

ON THE GAME

Hi-Lo or 711 as it is known throughout the star system is a game
played with cards or electronic extensions of cards between any number
of players and a dealer

The object of the game is to draw a hand as close as possible to
either 7 or 11 It is the players choice a judgment the player makes
after viewing his first card or up card

ON THE SHUTTLE CRAFT

standing ominously still where Boomer and Starbuck left it ona

ON A ROCK FORMATION

as Ovion faces begin to rise from concealment and move towards the
ship

IN FRONT OF THE PARADEESE de FESTIVE

Boomer ambles to a position of seclusion near some lush landscaping
He withdraws a pocket communicator and talks into it in hushed tones
BOOMER

Land probe to Galacticaland probe to Galactica Come in
There is no response
BOOMER

Boomer taps the small hand device and holds it up to his ear He can
hear static but no signal
BOOMER

POINT OF VIEW

Boxey moving along with Muffit Two behind him Suddenly Muffit Two
stops and looks towards camera and growls

THE OVION CREATURES

lower back beneath the ground

BOXEY

moves off towards Skyler Muffit continues to start at the mound

ON BOXEY

as he moves up to Skyler who is scanning the area with an electronic
probe

BOXEY

How soon before things begin to grow

SKYLER

Morning By the end of the day tomorrow well have a whole crop of
fresh food instead of comrations Wont that taste better

BOXEY

Id rather go home Whyd we have to leave Whyd those people want
to hurt us

SKYLER

Oh because there are and have always been living beings who cannot
accept anything they dont understandanything different

BOXEY

What do you mean different

SKYLER

Just about anything at allthe shape of your eyes the number of
limbs the color of the outer layer of your skineven thoughts and
ideas They just arent equipped to deal with difference

BOXEY

You mean theyre stupid
SKYLER

I guess by our standards How can it be anything but stupid to kill
what you dont understand
BOXEY

Why dont we kill them back
SKYLER

Then wed be changing what we areto be like them Its better for
us to go someplace else

BOXEY

What if they come after us

SKYLER

We might have to defend ourselves

BOXEY

You mean kill them

SKYLER

Possibly

BOXEY

Then wed be like them

SKYLER

Boxey youre beginning to see how complicated life is We dont
believe in war but the opposite of war isnt necessarily peace What
we want is freedomthe right to be left alone but theres always
the chance someone will come along and spoil everything

BOXEY

So you kill them

SKYLER

Noyou try to establish penalties Something that makes spoiling
someone elses way of life unrewarding

BOXEY

You kill them

SKYLER

Boxey you have a way of reducing everything to very simple terms I
dont knowmaybe youre rightin the end were talking about life
and death Life is precious No one has the right to tamper with
anothers without the risk of forfeiting their own I think maybe
were getting a little deep for a boy your age

BOXEY

Why You can die at any age cant you

SKYLER

Yes Boxey you canWheres Muffit

BOXEY

Right here

Boxey turns to look Muffit is not to be seen Then from beyond the
mound we hear barking

BOXEY

There he is

SKYLER

Better get him If he wanders off he could fall into an old mining
probe and wed never find him And be carefulstay in plain view of
the livery ships

BOXEY

I will

As Boxey turns and moves off Greenbean hurries up

ON GREENBEAN

GREENBEAN

Captain I think weve got problems
SKYLER

Youve found another droid
GREENBEAN

Nowe lost Jolly

Skyler gives Greenbean an impatient look

SKYLER

How could anybody lose Lieutenant Jollytheres so much of him he
almost qualifies as a planet Lets check it out

Skyler moves off with Greenbean

ON BOXEY

walking along amidst the mounds scanning in all directions
BOXEY

MuffyMuffyDarn you daggitWhere are you

Suddenly a hand appears on Boxeys shoulder He spins around He
starts to scream

ON AN OVION

As one hand reaches out to cove Boxeys mouth while two more hold his
arms to his side

INSIDE THE OVION CHAMBERS

Boxey is being led down a corridor by two Ovion creatures He is both
dismayed and frightened by the strange new world he has entered
Suddenly he hears barking He takes off on a dead run

BOXEY

Muffy

AN OVION SOLDIER

raises his weapon The other stops him from using it They start after
Boxey

ON THE ENTRANCE TO THE CHOSEN CHAMBER

Boxey charges up and through the legs of the Ovion guard as she
attempts to stop him The guard begins to pursue him

INSIDE THE CHOSEN CHAMBER

Boxey charges in sees Muffy standing beside Jolly barking at the
Chosen Leader Her name is Lotay As the Ovion guard is about to grab
Boxey Lotay raises a hand

LOTAY

Leave him

Boxey crouches beside Muffy holding him close Muffy licks his face

Lotay scans the odd assemblage before her -- an obese flyer a small
child and a peculiar-looking droid
LOTAY

A curious group

(after a thought a pleasant smile)

But they will do nicely Take them to a cell and prepare for the
others as quickly as possible

Jolly edges over grimly putting an arm around Boxey

IN THE PARADEESE de FESTIVE CASINO

AT STARBUCKS TABLE

another cheer goes up as Starbuck rakes in more cubits

STARBUCK

Let em ride again

STARBUCK

What gave me away

LORNA

Your tenacityI mean you get what you want and youre aloofAll
you people from Caprica are alike

(she giggles)

And also your insignia says your unit is from Caprica

STARBUCK

Howd you find out about this place

LORNA

A girlfriend at the office told me about three of her roomates coming
here They had such a good time they stayed overwrote us to come
It was too good a deal to pass up

STARBUCK

Whats a good deal
LORNA

Five cubits round trip all meals included for one centon I dont
know how they do it The food is so good Ive gained ten pounds and
my girlfriendif she doesnt stop eating theyll never get her
back off the planet

Starbuck looks around at the capacity crowd

STARBUCK
I guess they make it up on the gambling
LORNA
Except that Im ahead fifty cubits

Starbuck watches as the dealer punches up a cardA cheer from the
tableLorna giggles

LORNA

You win again

Boomer returns with a serious look on his face

BOOMER

(sotto)

Wed better talk

Starbuck reads Boomers expressionrises

STARBUCK

Thanks for the company

LORNA

(invitingly)

Any timehurry back

Boomer and Starbuck cross the casino into a lounge area from which
music is pulsating

STARBUCK

Where are we going Im finding out all sorts of things like the fact
that these people are completely cut off rom ews of the outside world
BOOMER

Im not surprised Be careful what you say were being watched

As Starbuck starts to look around

STARBUCK

Who by

Boomer slaps a hand on Sarbucks back and grins broadly for effect
BOOMER

RightLets have a drink and listen to some musicloud music

IN THE LOUNGE

A trio of female Tucanas are performing in what can best be described
as a spaced-out Supremes style of music Tucanas are unusual beings
in that while they are not totally unattractive in a feline sort of
way they do have two mouths which in a woman can be devastating
unless they happen to be singers

STARBUCK AND BOOMER

sit into a table combination for two and Starbuck is immediately taken
by the group

BOOMER

They cant try to read our lips in here

STARBUCK

The place is full of lips Look are you sure you arent imagining
things This place is all right

Starbuck places a cubit in a slot on a small pedestal in the middle of
the table A cup drops down and amber begins to stream into it He
then places a large stack of cubits in front of him to Boomers
amazement

BOOMER

Whered you get all those

STARBUCK

Hi-lo One thing this place isnt is crooked Would you listen to
those girls Theyre great

BOOMER

Forget the girls Talk to me What else did you pick up at that table
Starbuck continues to stare at the girls

STARBUCK

Like what

BOOMER

Like why they might need to watch us

STARBUCK

Who

He follows Boomers gaze

TWO OVIONS

standing by a dapery partition are looking towards Boomer and
Starbuck One turns and moves off

STARBUCK AND BOOMER

BOOMER

Ovions

STARBUCK

Who

BOOMER

Ovions Theyre all over the place My section got a briefing on them
from Intelligence

STARBUCK

Where do they come from

BOOMER

No one seems to kow much about them They just started showing up ona
few outposts mostly as migratory workers

STARBUCK

Looks like theyre well-equipped for that

BOOMER

Its their politics that are in doubt

STARBUCK

I dont see how thats too important any more

BOOMER

Why not

STARBUCK

How can we worry about subversion when we dont have a planet left
to subvert Hey would you listen to those girls Theyre incredible
ON THE GROUP

The middle lady belts out a song in a fashion not dissimilar to Bette
Midler The two ladies flanking her belt out oos and ‘ahs
singing four-part harmony with both mouths cranking out decibles of
music while the lead singer only seems to be using one of her two
orifices The upper mouth is definitely doing all the work but
effectivelyvery effectively

STARBUCK

is mesmerized

STARBUCK

We could make a fortune if we could put those girls on the star
circuit I mean big money Boomer

BOOMER

I dont believe you Every creature in the universe is out to
exterminate us and you want to hire a vocal group

STARBUCK

Have a little vision will ya The war cant last forever Someday
itll be over and whatll we beantiquated burned out fighter
pilots

THE GIRLS

go for their big finish The two outside ladies hitting a sustaining
chord only missing one element We somehow feel its forthcoming

THE MIDDLE LADY

soars for a high note with her upper mouth and just as we reach the
final few beats in the melodious piece we see the lower mouth silent
for the entire song open We know its comingand it doesa low
resounding bass note on the final beat of the song that breaks the
glass in Starbucks hand The room breaks into tumultuous applause
STARBUCK
is flabbergasted He rises
STARBUCK
I gotta’ talk to them
Boomer pulls him back down
BOOMER
You arent going to talk to anybody Were here on a mission
STARBUCK
And Im doing everything I can to find out whats going on What did
the Commander tell you to do

BOOMER

I couldnt reach the fleet

STARBUCK

Why not

BOOMER

Were in some kind of communication void Probably the canyon walls
STARBUCK

Well hike up to the shuttle and call in

(rising with some consternation)

Im telling you were sitting on top of a gold mine with these girls
and all you can see is danger behind every rock

BOOMER

Its a Tylium mine were suppose to find and wherere you

going

STARBUCK

It doesnt matter where Im going Youre going up to the shuttle to
heck in And the sooner you do the sooner well be getting food and
suppliess back to our ships Im telling you these are nice people
You can tell Commander Adama I said so

As Starbuck moves off towards the casino Boomer shakes his head
worriedly then moves off

OUTSIDE THE CASINO

Boomer exits and starts away Suddenly he finds he isnt alone
Moving to one side of him through the shrubbery is an Ovion To the
other side another Ovion He stops looks back Guarding the door
behind him another Ovion Boomer suddenly runs towards the rocks a
laser blast streaks out Boomer dives for cover His hand reaches down
to his belt He pushes an armature As the Ovions slowly move up to
him and level their weapons on him

BOOMER

Easy fellasnice bugs

ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA

Skyler appears on a monitor

SKYLER

First Sergeant Jollythen the boy and his droid

Adama greets the news with every possible defense

ADAMA

The surface is covered with mining probes They may have both fallen
in some similar crevice

ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON

Skyler speaks into a scanner

SKYLER

Two disappearances possibubut now our patrol beyond the ridge is
centons overdue and weve just picked up the Flight Sergeants
emergency beacon

ADAMA

nods concedint the weight of evidence

ADAMA

All right Captain Skyler Dispatch an immediate rescue mission beyond
the ridge

SKYLER

Id like to command it myself

ADAMA

No youve vital where you are

SKYLER

Commander Starbuck and Boomer are the best we have If theyre in
trouble

ADAMA

Very well Report in as soon as possible Galacica out

Adama signs off and turns to Tigh

ADAMA

I dont like the feel of it I think its time for an on-site
inspection Prepare my shuttle and a squad of your best Warriors
TIGH

Right away

TWO COLONIAL WARRIORS

streak over the edge of the mountain and across the sky

IN SKYLERS SHIP

He is scanning the groundsearching

SKYLER

Well follow the vector heading of the life signs Lieutenant Starbuck
was checking out

Skyler galnces over to the next ship

ON JOLLY

as he nods his understanding

ON SKYLER

SKYLER

Lets go down on the deck

ON SKYLERS SHIP

as he peels off and rakes down closer to the surface followed
immediately by the other ships in flights of three

AT THE LIVERY SHIPS

A cluster of Colonial Warriors are lined up in military formation
ADAMA

Well divide into teams of two and criss-cross the area from the point
Flight Sergeant Jolly disappeared We dont have much time so cover

your quadrants as quickly as possible All right disperse
Suddenly a womans frantic voice calls out

LYRA

Commander

The men step out of formation to depart Lyra rushes up to Adama
LYRA
Commander the boyBoxeyI just heard hes missing May I join
the search Ive grown very attached to that little waif

ADAMA

This isnt easy terrain

LYRA

Ive been to places in the star system that make this look like a
stellar lounge

ADAMA

Id be honored to have you aboard

She returns Adamas ingratiating smile

ON SKYLER IN HIS FIGHTING SHIP

as he soars along at tree-top level scanning the ground

SKYLER

I dont know where Starbucks shuttle is but its sure not on these
coordinates

GREEBEAN

He mustve decided to

Suddenly Greenbeans mouth flies open

GREENBEAN

Captain

SKYLER

already aware ofwhat Greenbean sees

SKYLER

I see it

GREENBEAN

What is it

SKYLER

I havent got the slightest idea but thats where Boomers distress
signal is coming from

GREENBEAN

What do we do about it

SKLER

Find a place to land and have a look

THE TWO FIGHTERS

peel off in search of a landing spot

ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON

Colonial Warrior criss-cross a segment of land which appears as a
slightly angled plane of black volcanic rock

ON TWO WARRIORS

as they move past camera we pan back to see the ground open up to
reveal to Ovion warriors moving up out of the ground

IN ANOTHER AREA

Greenbean and another Warrior move past camera Once again they are
no more than a few feet away when two more Ovions appear behind them
ON ADAMA

He stops with Lyra at his side to allow her to catch her breath A
cold wind chills them

LYRA

Getting very cold

ADAMA

We wont be able to continue the search much longer The
temperatures dropping too fast

Lyra looks off to one side

LYRA

Thats odd We seem to be the only ones on the summit

ADAMA

Mustve been moving a little faster than everyone else Ill admit Im
worried
Lyra turns and moves back past a rock formation on this high plateau
LYRA

Commander youd better have a look

Adama turns and moves back around the rock formation

POINT OF VIEW

A long sweeping vista of black volcanic rock anglingdown to a small
meadow where the livery ships stand ominously alone and still

ADAMA

turns back to Lyra

LYRA

Theyre all gonewere alone

ADAMA

quickly drwas his weapon

ADAMA

Its impossible

LYRA

Commander Im frightened Whats going on

ADAMA

I dont know but lets

Adama half turshis look freezes Lyra turns and screams

ON TWO OVIONS

their weapons extended towards the two humans

ON SKYLER AND GREENBEAN

as they approach the burned-out remains of two Viper War ships Both
men have their weapons drawn as they move up cautiously

GREENBEAN

If Boomer and Starbuck were in those birds sir

Skylerlooks down at his communicator It continues to flash
SKYLER

It would have been destroyed their distress beacon NoBoomers
signal is still loud and clear
GREENBEAN

What do we do

SKYLER

You stand guard on the ships We cant afford to lose two more Im
going to follow Boomers beacon It seems to be coming from down
there Whatever it is

Skyler moves with Boomer to look down on the Casino de Festive
INSIDE THE OVION CHAMBERS

Adama and Lyra are being escorted by guards As they reach the main
chamber Adama and Lyra look around in amazement

LYRA

What is it

MOVING POIINT OF VIEW

The large main chamber where countless Ovion workers mine Tylium
around the clock

ADAMA

It may be the largest underground Tylium mine in the star system
LYRA

To run our ships

ADAMA

(ominously)

To run somebodys ships

They arrive at the Chosen Chamber The guards stand aside Adama and
Lyra enter

INSIDE THE CHOSEN CHAMBER

Lotay looks up from her perch

LOTAY

You are Commander Adama

ON ADAMA AND LYRA

ADAMA

I am

LOTAY

Welcome to Carillon You are impressed

ADAMA

Outraged is more like it Where are my men and the boy

As easy smile crosses Lotays face

LOTAY

Would you care to join them

ADAMA

You bet I wouldand if anythings happened to any one of them
youll answer to the Colonies

The Chosen Leader smiles non-committally and rises We find that she
is taller than the worker Ovions She leads the way as the Ovion guard
move in behind Adama and Lyra

IN A CORRIDOR

LYRA

(sotto)

Did that smile mean she knows the Colonies dont exist

ADAMA

(sotto)

I dont know

They arrive at another entry The Leader stands aside

LOTAY

Enter

Adama and Lyra exchange wary looks and pass through the door
INSIDE THE GUEST CHAMBER

Adama and Lyra stop in their tracks and stare incredulously

POINT OF VIEW -- THE CHAMBER

alive with music and entertainmentfour-armed jugglers dancing
Ovionsand a banquet befitting kings with succulent victuals of
every dimension proportion and manner

JOLLY

JOLLY

Commander

Everyone turns to look Boxey jumps down from the knee of an Ovion
workers and runs to Lyra Jolly moves hurriedly food in handa
drumstick and an odd-looking piece of fruit

JOLLY

Its like nothing we could have dreamed of Theyve got plenty of
everything we need and they want to share it

LYRA

Sounds like paradise

Adama gazes around the room warilya troubled look on his face
ADAMA

Yes it does

LOTAY

We are a communal order from birth We all workWe all share
There is no competition no jealousy no conflictonly peace and
order

ADAMA

Perpetual happiness

LOTAY

Happiness is the goal of an immature order All pursue it Few have
it None can sustain it The Ovion is content It is better
Adama and Lyra exchange cautious looks

LYRA

It seems to work for you

LOTAY

For millenniums it has been so Now join us Be our guestsbe
well fed well entertained Be content

The Ovion Leader smiles that strange bewildering look that suggests
a private meaning Adama cant help feeling its more than a benign
suggestion

IN THE CASINO ON TWO OVION SECURITY GUARDS

watching Starbuck and looking anything but benign

ON STARBUCK AT THE HI-LO TABLE

A cheer arises from the gallery which by this time is substantial
They watch with vicarious fear as Starbuck presses his entire
accumulations of cubits out on the wagering table

ON LORNA

LORNA

Whatre you going to do with all that money

STARBUCK

Let it all ride

A small cheer from Lorna and the two obese gentlemen As we pan off to
the main door as a figure enters

SKYLER

looks around incredulously He hears a resounding cheerlooks
POINT OF VIEW

A narrow aperture through the gallery reveals the image of a Colonial
Warrior as the center of attention

THE DEALER

seems to be looking for help He is perspiring

DEALER

I will have to see if they will remove the limit

The dealer signals os as Skyler moves up and stares in utter
disbelief at the pile of golden cubits in front of a cigar-smoking
Starbuck

SKYLER

Lieutenant do you mind telling me what youre doing

Starbuck turns somewhat startled and embarrassed

STARBUCK

WinningI mean

e struggles to his feet rising awkwardly from his stool

ir

KYLER

at is this place Whats going on here

tarbuck turns to Lorna

TARBUCK

excuse me dearWatch my cubits

tarbuck hustles Skyler a few feet away to talk conspiratorially as
few yards away the pit boss gestures in pantomime to the dealer
TARBUCK

Siras near as we can figure this is a resort These people
re here from all over the star system

KYLER

at doesnt make any sense This place is a desolate rock
STARBUCK

Maybebut everyones having a great time

SKYLER

HnAMONMNQGNHNANNA
Not everyone

STARBUCK

Everyone that Ive seen

SKYLER

How long since you talked to Boomer
STARBUCK
Boomer
SKYLER
Somebody blew up his shipyours too
STARBUCK
Blew up our ships Boomer went there to use the long-range
communicator If someone did something to Boomer

SKYLER
He never reached the ship His distress beacon is still working

thats what bothers me

STARBUCK

It cant be working I didnt pick it up

SKYLER

Im not picking it up now eitherbut my flyover pointed right to
where youre standing

STARBUCK

CaptainBoomer isnt herehe left

SKYLER

If he isnt in this building hes under it

Skyler and Boomer exchange ominous looks as the pit boss moves up

PIT BOSS

Sir as a special courtesy to our Colonial Warrior guests the limit
has been removed

Starbuck looks at Skyler questioningly as a cheer of anticipation
rises from the gallery Skyler nods

SKYLER

Go ahead Lucky Break the bank Id like to see what happens when
you try to walk out of here with their money

Starbuck pales

STARBUCK

Lookmaybe weve learned all we can here

SKYLER

Nonoyou go right ahead Ill just look around for a bit
STARBUCK

Id feel better if you were watching my flank

SKYLER

You were doing fine before I got here Good luck

Skyler moves off leaving Starbuck alone as Lorna moves to him and
takes his arm and pulls him to the table

LORNA

Come on sport Youre going to bring the house down

STARBUCK

Thats whats worrying me

MOVING THROUGH THE CASINO WITH SKYLER

as he edges past more games of chance as cheers rise from each table
Finally Skyler reaches a bank of elevators He notices a large group
of rather obese people being escorted by Ovions into an elevator
Skyler moves up to join the group An Ovions hand bars the way

OVION

You have a voucher

SKYLER

I just wanted to browse Where does this go
OVION

It is the chamber of the Living End You must have a voucher

SKYLER

I hope its a reducing salon Looks like some of these boys have been
having too good a time Can I look around

OVION

When you have a voucher It comes at the end of your two week stay
The people have all entered the elevator car and the Ovion who has
been speaking with Skyler now steps back into the car himself

SKYLER

Two week stayLook I dont plan on sticking

The door whisks closed in Skylers face and whisks downward out of
sight He finishes the statement to himselfself and turns to
head back through more cheering guests taking curious and troubled
note of what he is seeing Suddenly he turns and heads towards the
front doors at an easy gait As he closes to them he is aware that
Ovion Guards are following his progress

AT THE FRONT DOORS

Skyler pauses as he is about to start outside Quickly he looks back
into the room

POINT OF VIEW

One of the Ovions who has been tracking him has a transceiver in his
hand and is talking into it Finding himself caught by Skylers gaze
he lowers the transceiver

SKYLER
swings his look back out the door

POINT OF VIEW TO THE VEGETATION OUTSIDE

Two shadows ducking back behind some shrubbery
SKYLER
turns and moves back across the casino towards Starbuck
AT STARBUCKS TABLE
a cheer from the gallery as Starbucks winnings mount The game now
watched closely by a pit boss and several guards who begin to press
in more closely Skyler eyes them behind Starbuck warily Lorna leans
in pawing Starbuck admiringly

LORNA

You are the luckiest man Ive ever

Suddenly she stops in mid-sentence her jaw hanging open as she sees
Skyler slowly raising his sidearm from its holster to bring it
directly to bear on the dealers chest A gasp from the crowd
STARBUCK

What are you doing

SKYLER

Im going to see if I can put a hole through him

The dealers eyes flare wide with alarm In an instant the head
security guard is at Starbucks side

HEAD SECURITY GUARD

Siryoull have to

As he starts to draw his weapon he finds Starbucks sidearm quickly
in his side Starbuck quickly moves an arm around the Ovions head
turning him towards the other security guards moving up transforming
him into a shield

STARBUCK

Lets keep our hands out where we can see em fellas All of them
Now you mind telling me what were doing sir

THE APPROACHING SECURITY GUARDS

stop in place and refrain from any movement towards their weapons

SKYLER

unflinchinghis weapon leveled at the dealer

HEAD SECURITY GUARD

If I may askwhat seems to be your complaint

SKYLER

This man is cheating my friend

STARBUCK

What

An incredulous remble moves through the gallery Skyler is beginning
to lose their support Obviously hes a military psychopath

HEAD SECURITY GUARD

But he is winning

SKYLER

No He appears to be winning The dealer is cheating

STARBUCK

Ah look SkylerCaptainIm pretty good you know

HEAD SECURITY GUARD

Sir if you doubt his good fortune I suggest he pick up his cubits
and leave

STARBUCK

Sounds like a real good idea Skyler Why dont we just be on our
way

SKYLER

Not until somebody explains why he was letting him win

HEAD SECURITY GUARD

Nothing could be more absurd

STARBUCK

Does sound a bit odd Look maybe these fellasd be willing to help
us get to our ship if we just give back the winnings and forget the
whole thing

SKYLER

They dont mind winners Starbuck There isnt a loser in the house
They see to that

HEAD SECURITY GUARD

A human weaknessmomentous judgements on miniscule perspectives
As the people begin to grumble at Skylers destroying heir party
OBESE MAN 1

Look fella why dont you tell your friend to go back to his ship
and sleep it off huh

LORNA

Right You have something against people having a litle funwinning
a little money

STARBUCK

Captain come on Youre going to have everyone at our throats
SKYLER

Just ask yourselves have you seen a loser here Doesnt that strike
all of you as odd

OBESE MAN 2

What is it boy You worried about the taxes on our winnings That
why youre here boy You a tax collector

OBESE MAN 1

You come to close this place down fella

The room is turning angry Skyler raises his weapon

SKYLER

He was letting you win

LORNA

Why
SKYLER

Maybe to keep you here or content I dont know

OBESE MAN 1

Put your weapon away son or Im going to take it away from you

e man moves off his chair towards Skyler

TARBUCK

aptain with all due respect

yler realizes the contrantations quickly going to get out of hand
e starts to back away his weapon in front of him

BESE MAN 1

laybe you can explain what youre doing here boy You come for a
acation or for trouble

e people continue to move towards Starbuck and Skyler the security
uards amongst them waiting for an opportuity Starbuck and Skyler
ind themselves with the front doors cut off from them by the guards
KYLER

eres trouble all right The war with the Alliance is over We
ost

BESE MAN 2

ost You poor fool Youve been on patrol too long Theres been an
rmistice Didnt you hear

e crowd begins to laugh at Skyler

BESE MAN 1

e laugh turns to jeers The noise becomes deafening Skyler edges
owards the elevator

TARBUCK

KYLER

tarbuck

TARBUCK

e minute we do the Ovionsll start shooting

KYLER

e old duck and roll

STARBUCK

Right

Starbuck quickly scans the area He looks up

POINT OF VIEW

an ornate chandelier high in the ceiling in front of the elevators
STARBUCK

shifts the barrel of his sidearm upward and in one deft movement
sends a laser blast streaming from the ceiling and turns and ducks
for an open elevator with Skyler right behind him

ON THE CEILING

as the ornate chandelier is blasted out of its moorings and starts
for the floor

THE CROWD

starts forward then jumps back as the fixture crashes in front of
the doorway sending a pillar of debris and electrical shorting
END OF HOUR TWO

HOUR THREE

FADE IN

ON ELEVATOR DOORS IN A SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE

They open emitting a covey of Ovions who run from the car and stand
looking off down two intersecting corridors which range off into

HNDHNNHNHNHNHHNAHATAOHMHFOHHMMNQOHS ZBODTNANH

complete blackness The Ovions raise their sidearms and fire
resounding laser blasts off into the black abyss Quickly aother team
of Ovions move up in two land vehicles Two Ovions climb on one
vehicle two more on the other and the machines whine off in opposite
directions

Momentarily all is still We pan back to the elevator car and find
two pairs of legs descending from the top of the car

SKYLER AND STARBUCK

drop to the floor and ease cautiously out into the passageway
STARBUCK

On reconsideringI believe there may be something to your suspicions
about this place Lets move One of these tunnels must lead out of
here

SKYLER

They also lead to those fellas who were firing full charges at what
they hoped was us That isnt nice Starbuck

STARBUCK

I dont see how we have any choice unless youre suggesting we go
back the way we came in You wouldnt suggest that would you

OS a whine can be heard Both men turn and look

STARBUCK

Im not real crazy about the sound of that

SKYLER

Im not either

POINT OF VIEW

an eerie light approaching from down the dark passageway

SKYLER AND STARBUCK

reach in unisonturn and scamper for the elevator carraise their
hands over their heads jump and pull themselves up out of sight
Panning back we find a tram pullung up to a stop beside the elevator
From the front of the tram three Ovions exit and move into the
elevator car

FROM UP ABOVE THE CAR

we find Skyler and Starbuck watching helplessly as the Ovions
conversing in high-pitched chatter The car stops They exit and move
into the Casino leaving Starbuck and Skyler trapped

STARBUCK

This isnt turning out to be as much fun as Id hoped Now what
SKYLER

Now we wait

STARBUCK

What for

SKYLER

For someone to take us back down

STARBUCK

Im not too crazy about that idea either At least up here there are
people we could talk to

SKYLER

These people are no better off than we are You saw that shuttle down
there I figure it just came back from taking a load of these people
someplace

STARBUCK

Where

SKYLER

Thats a good question Ive got a hunch the answer is the reason for
this places existence

ON THE GALACTICA
hovering amongst the fleet above the planet Carillon A space shuttle
approaches from the rear

ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA

Colonel Tigh receives a courier reads the information and looks up
troubled

TIGH

Im leaving the bridge Ill be with Commander Adama if Im needed
ON COMMANDER ADAMA IN HIS QUARTERS

He sits at a desk dictating into a device

ADAMA

The Ovion people have extended to the survivors of the colonies every
measure of goodness and support we might have hoped for It is now
possible to foresee the entire fleet able to resume our voage within
a centon

CLOSE ON AN AUTOMATIC WRITING DEVICE

A small tube-like extension which focuses a small measure of light
on a roll of paper As the light moves by lettering is placed
silently and nearly on the paper There is a knock at the door
ADAMA

Come in

Colonel Tigh enters Adama glances at him

ADAMA

Nothing can be that bad Weve found supplies adequate to carry our
people far out of this star system We couldnt have fallen on
better fortune

TIGH

No sir In fact things are too good

Adama gives Tigh a curious look

ADAMA

Too good

TIGH

Most of our people are still on comrations As tasty as Id like to
say they are they just dont measure up to thestories coming back
from the surface of Carillon Theres a lot of talk going around
ADAMA

What kind of talk

TIGH

That youre exceedig your authority by keeping people in the ships
instead of allowing them some time on the planet

Adama rises in a state of shock

ADAMA

Exceeding my authority This is a voyage of survival We could be
under attack at any time The crews on Carillon are down there

to work not party

TIGH

Sir all of our people have been through a debilitating shock Im
sure some of them are getting a little of it our of their systems
ADAMA

Just what is it youre telling me I dispatched two of our elite
squadrons to harvest food and obtain fuel for our survival Now whats
going on down there

Tigh says nothing but his expression sends the Commander toward the
door

ADAMA

Prepare my shuttle

ON THE FLIGHT DECK

Adama exits an elevator and heads towards his shuttle As he does he
sees a group of twelve men disembarking a second craft They form a
grim barrier as he moves up to them sensing an uneasy confrontation
ADAMA

AntonSethand Seppy So good to see you all

ANTON

You appear to be leaving

Adama will need more than a smile He knows this is not going to go
well

ADAMA

I have to go down to the surface of Carillon
ANTON

(caustically)

Of course We understand

ADAMA

Im not sure that you do

ANTON

Adama we want to discuss an orderly
rotation of all our people down to Carillon

ADAMA

I dont think thats wise

SETH

The Quorum does

ANTON

Adama we took the liberty of holding a council to elect new
leadership

ADAMA

I see And what was the outcome

SETH

Each of us here has been elected to represent out respective colonies
We are the new Quorum of the Twelve

ADAMA

And have we a new President

ANTON

Why of course Adama You

The men applaud and backslap Adama with nervous affection

ADAMA

Thank you It will be my pleasure to serve you However I cannot
permit

LOBE

Adama you have run a ship as big as a sun center Some of our people
are cramped up in cubicles no bigger than a cubit

ANTON

And it may be a long time between stops

LOBE

Its only fair our people share in the fruits of Carillon

ADAMA

Anton surely you understand that we are still at war An Alliance
has dedicated itself to our extinction You must recognize a need for
extraordinary measures I cannot allow our people down on Carillon
before inspecting the conditions and its possible risks

ANTON

Of course We all understand that so why dont we accompany you and
see for ourselves shall we

Enthusiastically they all start for the shuttle ship as Adamas
expression turns grim

IN A DARK TUNNEL

Ovions approach on a surface craft and enter the elevator pod
STARBUCK

We could have been far away from here by now

SKYLER

Theyve got scanners and vehicles They didnt expect us to stay
around

STARBUCK

Because they were under the impression we were intelligent beings
No offense

SKYLER

As always Ill involve your youth to save your aresford This is the
last place theyll be looking for us

Starbuck gestures to a long tram-like vehicle parked in the tunnel
STARBUCK

Why not take that vehicle

SKYLER

Because it looks like it moves slowly and makes a lot of noise
STARBUCK

Id still feel better than sitting here waiting for what
SKYLER

For that vehicle to move

STARBUCK

Where

SKYLER

Where I think we want to go

STARBUCK

Skyler sirwould you mind sharing a few pieces of the magic puzzle
I mean Ive seen

SKYLER

Well I think I know how someone can run a casino that gives away
money

STARBUCK

What is it

SKYLER

Im not sure you want to hear it

STARBUCK

Try me

SKYLER

Suppose theres a very rich mine on this planet

STARBUCK

Yeah

SKYLER

I mean its rich if you have somebody to mine it

STARBUCK

Which they dont

SKYLER

What if they do What if those Ovions are bringing in people from all
over the star system to visit this wonderful casino resort where you
cant lose except in the end

STARBUCK

Ahhh Skyler thats ugly

SKYLER

Yes it isif they wind up as slave labor down in a Tylium mine
STARBUCK

Thats a long shot Some of those people were so fat they couldnt
touch their shoes let alone mine Tylium Thats hard work

SKYLER

Doesnt take long to work off weight in a Tylium mine

STARBUCK
You know something
SKYLER
What
STARBUCK
I felt better about those Ovions when I didnt understand them
SKYLER
The next load of people they move out in that thing probably in the
morningwere going to climb on and find out if Im right
STARBUCK
Uhuhon the chance that you are right whichever way that thing
goes I go the other way
SKYLER
I could order you to go with me
STARBUCK
Are you ordering me
SKYLER
No Its liable to be a one-way trip
STARBUCK
Right
SKYLER
Helping to save humanity is going to have to be a personal decision
Starbuck Goodnight
Skyler tucks his head down on top of the elevator and closes his eyes
Starbuck watches him for a long beat then looks off with a totally
disgusted look on his face
STARBUCK
Ahhhhhh Feljurcreb
IN THE OVION BANQUET ROOMS
continued merriment laughter food and drink Only Boxey is moving
about looking worried
BOXEY
MuffyMuffy
He cant seem to find the droid He wanders towards the door where an
Ovion guard stands watch The guard is talking to a second guard in
the corridor He doesnt notice Boxey move off down the corridor
ON THE LARGE MINE
The cavernous room from which the mining operation can be observed
LOTAY

the largest Tylium mine in all the star system
Panning off we find the Quorum of the Twelve being guided on a tour
ANTON
Its a testimony to communal order
LOTAY
Thank you
IN THE OVION LEADERS PRIVATE CHAMBER
They enter to find a large feast prepared for them on floor mats and
pillows in the center of the room On one side gentle music is
emitted from two stringed instruments in contrast to the rousing
melodies indigenous to the more public dining area
ANTON
This is too much to expect
LOTAY
We have plenty As many of your people who desire it are invited to
be our guests
Anton turns to Adama
ANTON

Can you in good conscience deny our people such an invitation

ADAMA

Well perhaps a very carefully organized small rotation

SETH

But I thought time was our greatest consideration The more we bring
here at once the sooner we can be on our way

Adama turns to the Leader

ADAMA

May I ask how our request for Tylium is being received

LOTAY

We have already prepared the first shipment for you have we not
ADAMA

Yes we boarded it However I understand there is to be a delay in
obtaining any more

LOTAY

Unfortunately we were not prepared for your request Only two
centons ago we dispatched almost all that was on hand What we gave
you this day was what we were able to mine yesterday We are
industrious Commander but we are also small

Lotay smiles ingratiatingly

ANTON

I think we press our luck Commander Let us not be rude in the face
of such hospitality

LOTAY

Please begin Be our guests Be well fed well entertained Be
content

As the Ovion leader is about to step away Adama brings her to a stop
ADAMA

You arent joining us

LOTAY

(a vague smile crosses her face)

NoI am afraid not

She simlply moves off On her exit

ANTON

Well I dont think there can be any doubt as to our decision It
will take time to obtain the Tylium We will give every person an
opportunity to share in our bounty down here on Carillon

IN A CORRIDOR

Lotay moves briskly along escorted by four Ovion guards They reach
a chamber Lotay stops looks up and down the corridor and enters
alone
ON THE BACK OF AN EMPERORS CHAIR

Lotay moves forward until she has come to a point just in front of
the chair She bows her head

LOTAY

By your command
ON THE THRONE
Baltar sits draped across the chair a smug smile on his face On
either side of him are the two Cylon Centurians

BALTAR
I see youre entertaining these days

LOTAY

The Colonials have only allowed a few of their Warriors to land
BALTAR

I knew your hospitality would be impossible to refuse After all the
experience youve had dining with humans

Baltar cannon resist laughing at his private joke

BALTAR

And what of Commander Adama

LOTAY

A brief visit He is with the fleet now
BALTAR

I want him here When he is in our grasp

we have won

TIGH

But we cant shuttle everyone to the surface of Carillonthe fuel

and the pilots

ATHENA

(adding her voice)

Therell be no one left to stand alert
COMMANDER ADAMA

paces away from Athena and Tigh He looks out the vast window to space
with the ships of the fleet scattered across the sky above Carillon
ADAMA

Have we heard from Captain Skyler yet

TIGH

No sir Hes been out of contact a full centon

ADAMA

Does something feel very wrong to you Colonel of am I just
hopelessly paranoid

TIGH

I once read a book on tactical survival in an alien world It saida
little paranoia was good for you

Adama nods heading out

ADAMA

Im familiar with that book I wrote it Prepare my shuttle Im
returning to the surface

TIGH

Commander about your book

ADAMA

Yes Ive prepared a set of orders to cover that contingency In
them you will find my instructions for what to do to save the
Galactica and her fold should the unhappy need arise

Adama withdraws an envelope from his tunic and passes it to Tigh who
examines it carefully

TIGH

You cant be serious

ADAMA

Deadly serious

The two men exchange grim looks born of years of service together in
the face of a ruthless enemy

ON TOP OF THE ELEVATOR WITHIN THE CASINO CORRIDOR

Starbuck lies facing up into the darkness his eyes open

STARBUCK

Skyler

SKYLER

Mmmm

STARBUCK

You awake

SKYLER

Yeah

STARBUCK

You hear something

SKYLER

No

STARBUCK

Sounded like a door opening above

SKYLER

Must be almost morning by now Could be another one of their health
tours

STARBUCK

You really intend to see where they go

SKYLER

Uh-huh

STARBUCK

Just like your father

Skyler seems to care about the conversation for the first time His
eyes shift over to the form sharing the claustrophobic space beside
him

STARBUCK

No offense meant I guess I have a reputation for taking things kind
of loose and easy Doesnt mean I dont appreciate it whem someone
sticks his neck out for me You I mean

SKYLER

(embarrassed)

I thought we were talking about my father

STARBUCK

I wasin a wayI meanwe wouldnt have survived if he hadnt
done what he didand what you didwhat you had to do That took
a lot of courage too

SKYLER

This isnt courage Starbuck its reflex You know youre a complete
Warrior when you find you can leave your own brother behind to die
STARBUCK

To save how many more brothers You cant feel responsible

SKYLER

Starbuck youre a naive young boy Let me tell you what I feel
whats really bothering me Its how long its taking me to feel
anything at all Only now two centons after hes gone do I begin
to acheto start to hurtto want to cry Thats how programmed
Ive become So which one of us is the lesser living creature The
one thats gone on or the one who is left behind and feels nothing
Starbuck finds hes opened up a floodgate he isnt equipped to handle
STARBUCK

I dont know
SKYLER

Now you sound like a leader I dont know either

Suddenly the elevator begins to move downwards Both men freeze with
cautious anxiety as the car stops

POINT OF VIEW

The shuttle vehicle begins loading passengers in front of the
elevator They are all large almost obeses creatures some human
some not but all in a condition to necessitate waddling aboard the
bus

STARBUCK

(sotto)

Maybe its going home time

SKYLER

Uh-uh Im willing to bet its the great big payoff to the free trip
to Carillon Oh I forgot You wont be around to see who wins
STARBUCK

Well now if you want to make a wager out of itI mean a real
mans wager

Starbuck looks at Skyler with growing significance

SKYLER

It could be the most important bet youve made Starbuck It could
save a lot of people or it could cost you big

Starbuck looks at Skyler with affection

STARBUCK

It wont be the first time I rode everything I had on a long shot
SKYLER

Thanks

ON THE TOUR TRAM

as it moves out

ON STARBUCK AND SKYLER
as they drop off he top of the elevator onto the tram
INSIDE THE OVION CHAMBERS
The largest chamber A tour is in progress festive in mood Seetol
the Ovion guard pointing out the wonderful ways of their world
Amongst the gallery Lyra and Athena
SEETOL
star systems largest Tylium mine with a per annum capacity equal
to the needs of the entire galaxy
ATHENA
(sotto)
I wonder why it is then thay theyve only managed to ship us one
token load
LYRA
Ive noticed another curious thing
(louder)
May I ask a question
The group stops and turns to Lyra as Seetol displays a public
relations smile
SEETOL
You are our guests Of course
LYRA
I am fasciated by the order of your society and I cannot help but be
impressed by your industryyour complete dedicationI mean one
gets the feeling that these people work until they simply drop
SEETOL
We know no other way
LYRA
Well what of family institutions I somehow sense that something is
missing
SEETOL
We are very complete
LYRA
What about males
SEETOL
Males
LYRA
Well I dont mean to pry but this is a female culture Surely there
must be males someplace Perhaps you keep them at home where they
belong
A laugh from a group dominated by males
SEETOL
We dont keep them at all
LYRA
I beg your pardon
SEETOL
You are correct Males have their place until they have served their
purpose and then they have no place in our society
As the implications become clearer Lyra is torn between lividity and
a gulp
LYRA
Well there certainly are value systems in your order worth looking
into
Another small nervous laugh and Seetol leads the group on Lyra and
Athena quickly lean their heads together as they move on
ATHENA
She didnt mean what it sounded like
LYRA

Remind me not to ask any more questions until were out of here
Suddenly there is a commotion coming towards the tour group

FOUR OVION GUARDS

are running up the corridon in pursuit What they are pursuing is not
clear at first as the countless Ovion workers begin chattering their
high-pitched network of communications which drowns out an equally
high-pitched series of cries Suddenly it is clear

ANOTHER ANGLE

to reveal a small barking droid racing along the corridor
desperately trying to avoid its pursuers

LYRA

is the first to recognize the situation

LYRA

Muffy

Muffy quickly stops in its trackslooksruns to Lyra and begins a
frantic barking

LYRA

Muffyits me Now what are you doing Stop that

The Ovion guards rush up and begin to reach for Muffy but he quickly
takes asylum between Lyras legs and the wall

LYRA

Its all righthes just a droidIll take care of him

The Ovion begins to push Lyra out of the way

LYRA

Now stop that I told you to leave him alone What are you doing
Seetol quickly moves up and communicates to the lead guard in high-
pitched chatterig Seetol turns a frozen smile to Lyra

SEETOL

You will have to allow them to take the droid

LYRA

I will not He belongs to a little boy

The significance of this strike her She turns to Seetol

LYRA

The little boyhave they seen him

SEETOL

No

LYRA

How do you know You havent asked them

(She turns to the guard)

A small childhes always with the droid Did you see him

The guard turns quickly to Seetolsays nothing

SEETOL

They did see a child It might be better if you went with them
rather than delay the tour

ATHENA

Ill go with her

SEETOL

If you wish The rest of the group must follow me

Seetol leads them off As they depart a sense of emptiness befalls
Athena and Lyra

LYRA

Maybe you should stay with them I dont like the feel of this
ATHENA

At least Im a trained Warrior

LYRA

A little outnumbered dont you think
ATHENA

Well were only goig to look for a small child Lets not let our
imaginations run wild

LYRA

Exactly Well gentlemen after you

The Ovion guards gesture for them to lead off in another direction
exchanging quick personal looks They start to lead Muffy running
along beside them

ON THE TOUR TRAM

racing along its course

ON ITS ROOF

Starbuck and Skyler hanging on

SKYLER

You all right

STARBUCK

Beat walking backmaybe
SKYLER

One things bothering me
STARBUCK

Now you tell me What is it
SKYLER

You notice those people getting on this thing
STARBUCK

How could I help it They must average three hundred pounds

SKYLER

Something that girl said Theyre all putting on inordinate weight
If youre importing people for slave labor why bother letting them
get fat Its a waste of food

STARBUCK

And why let em win money Its a waste of time

A heave look crosses Starbucks face

SKYLER

Starbuck

STARBUCK

Yeah

SKYLER

Skip itits too ugly

On Starbucks worried face as the vehicle rolls off through the canyon
towards its curious destination

AN OVION CORRIDOR

Athena and Lyra are being escorted up to a cell block They begin to
hear the eerie dsiquieting moaning

ATHENA

Whats that awful sound

LYRA

I wouldnt ask if I were you

Suddenly Lyra turns and stops dead in her tracks startled beyond
belief Athena screams

POINT OF VIEW

The cell containing a crush of living beings packed together Muffy
beings to bark The Ovions shove the two ladies ahead and past the
cell window as we hear a small voice barely discernable

BOXEY

Muffy

They have reached another cell Boxey stands at the window The room
is obviously identical to the one adjacent to it save for Boxey An
aperture in the wall beside the window is opened Muffy charges in
and jumps up on Boxey

SEETOL

Inside

LYRA

LookI have no intention

She does not finish the sentence She is hurled into the aperture and
catapulted into the glass room through some kind of vacuum device in
the aperture Athena begins to scream It is lost in a hiss of steam
as she is pushed into the aperture

SEETOL

nods for the Ovion guards to close the aperture As the nearest guard
is about to do so Muffy turns his head looks and streaks through
the opening out of the cell between the legs of the guard and up
the corridor

SEETOL

(a high-pitched frantic demand)

The guards streak up the corridor in pursuit of Muffy

IN ANOTHER OVION CHAMBER

the tram has come to a stop inside a large dark area A row of Ovion
guards well-armed and moving in a most businesslike fashion move up
to form a rank just ooutside of the tram A device is attached to the
door of the tram opening it with a hiss The first of several hefty
passengers step out into the room gazing around in wonder and some
consternation

SEETOL

Please move quickly

Seetol gestures towards a moving ramp which disappears into a cell-
like entrance

OBESE MAN 1

Look fella up til now this has been a pretty nice trip but that
bus was as hot as anything Ive ever been in

SEETOL

Please move along

OBESE MAN 2

No now you just hold on We dont intend

Suddenly two Ovion guards shove the two men onto the ramp sending
them flying unceremoniously into a heap Behind them the other Ovions
pick up the signal and abandon all decorum and pretense shoving the
next people along with the barrels of their weapons The women
immediately begin to scream as they find themselves hurled into the
loading mechanism which carries the frightened scrambling visitors
through the wall towards the unknown
ON THE TOP OF THE TRAM
Skyler and Starbuck stare in amazement at the spectacle

LOSER ON THE GUARDS

uckling in high-pitched frequencies over the way the living cargo

is being unloaded To their backs Starbuck and Skyler slide off of
the roof down the side of the tram and slip stealthily vack into
the darkened recesses of the chamber

ON MUFFY

racing through the corridor with Ovio guards chasing him

ON THE MAIN MINING CHAMBER

as Starbuck and Skyler step out of the shadows of a tributary corridor
and gaze around the immense digging in amazement

STARBUCK

Its huge

SKYLER

And this is just one level You notice something else

STARBUCK

Ovions are doing the mining

SKYLER

Right

STARBUCK

Which means

SKYLER

Its awful Starbuck That casino is a feedlot

Starbuck contemplates what Skyler is saying

STARBUCK

Come on

SKYLER

Theyre a race of cannibals Theyre drawing in creatures from all
over the star system fattening them up with indulgences then
STARBUCK

I thought Id run into just about everything Now what do we do
Weve got to tell the fleet about this place

SKYLER

(onimously)

They know about it Look

ACROSS THE MINE

a group of tourists from the fleet are being escorted
GUIDE

largest Tylium mine in the star system

STARBUCK

What are they doing here

SKYLER

Whatever it is it look voluntary Come on

Skyler steps out ito the light of the corridor and starts towards the
tour

STARBUCK

Where are you going now Theyre going to see

Seetol and two Ovion guards round the corner almost colliding with
Skyler and Starbuck The guards raise their weapons

SKYLER

Excuse uswe just got separated from our group

Skyler gracefully oushes the muzzle of the closest guards weapon out
of the way as he points after the tour just about to move out of the
main room

STARBUCK

(to Seetol)

Wed better hurry along or theres no telling where well end up
Skyler and Starbuck nerve their way past the Ovions who stare after
them not quite sure what to make of the situation As Skyler and
Starbuck rapidly approach the distant tour their story beings to make
visibile sense and Seetol turns from the tour and continues on her
way with the guards on either side of her

ON THE TOUR

As Skyler and Starbuck catch up stealing a look back over their
shoulders As the tour moves into an elevator

JENSING

Whered you boys come from Youve missed most of the tour

STARBUCK

Weve seen quite a lot actually

IN THE ELEVATOR

JENSING

Youre lucky you didnt miss the next stop Were guests of honor at
a banquet

Skyler and Starbuck exchange knowing looks

INSIDE THE EMPERORS ROOM

Lotay kneels before Baltar who is flanked by the two Centurians
LOTAY

A mere token force remains in the fleet of ships above Carillon and
Commander Adama is now our guest

BALTAR

Where

LOTAY

Where he will not be disturbed

BALTAR

Excellent Lotay As to the Warriors until weve disarmed them I
want as many of them relegated to a single chamber as possible

A Centurian steps forward

CENTURIAN

By your command Baltar It is time to call in the Cylon war machine
Baltar thinks about it

BALTAR

Yes you are rightbut only on my terms
CENTURIAN

And what are your terms

BALTAR

An arangement I have worked out very carefully

ON A CYLON HOME BASE

somewhere in deep space

INSIDE THE IMPERIOUS LEADERS INNER CHAMBER

a Centurian enters the large oom and crosses to the throne
CENTURIAN

By your command

IMPERIOUS LEADER

Speak

CENTURIAN

Baltar sends a demand for the Base Star stationed at Quasar 47 for
immediate assault on the Human Fleet

IMPERIOUS LEADER

I will send him ten Base Stars

CENTURIAN

He will accept only one

IMPERIOUS LEADER

Indeedand what is this bargain that I must accept
IN THE BANQUET ROOM

The tour arrives with Starbuck and Skyler Music and a general air of
decadence dissipation the order of the day

STARBUCK
Would you look at thistheyre having a party

Skyler moves to Anton who appears to be slightly drunk He laughs
robustly a golden goblet in one hand a large fowl leg in the other
SKYLER
Count Antonwhats happened Why are all these people here Carillon
was supposed to be a work stop

ANTON
Ah Commander Adamas elite corps Of course you boys wanted all this
to yourselves Well Im afraid this is a democracy

SKYLER
Its going to be a debacle if you dont get these people out of here
An Ovion servant seems to be taking an inordinate amount of time
refilling the wine glasses around Anton Skyler turns from him
placing an arm around Aton to lead him off

ANTON

Lieutenant in case you hadnt heard you are draping yourself all
over a member of the Quorum of the Twelve

SKYLER

Unless you want the shortest term in history wed better talk

ANTON

I dont like your tone

STARBUCK

You arent going to like what were going to tell you either

Anton studies Starbucks deliberate and penetrating gaze He cannot
dismiss this most celebrated young Warrior

ANTON

Lieutenant Starbuck Ive never been particularly fond of your bravado
escapades This had better be important

They move off together In their wake the Ovion servant moves quickly
off to speak to a guard at the door The guard immediately departs

IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM

ANTON

Now thenwhats this all about

SKYLER

Starbuck and I just returned from a patrol What weve seen convinces
us that the Ovions will never allow a single human to leave here
alive

ANTON

Youre not serious What possible motive could they have for wanting
us all dead I suppose youre going to tell me theyre part of the
Cylon Alliance

SKYLER

Worse

ON SKYLER AND STARBUCK FROM ACROSS THE ROOM

As Skylers lips blurt out the rest of the story we can see Anton
pale as the details are revealed

IN THE EMPERORS ROOM

Seetol confronts Baltar

BALTAR

Who are these two Warriors who are causing the disturbance Describe
them to me

ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA

BRIDGE OFFICER

The livery ships have returned to the fleet sir and weve all but
completed boarding the food stores

TIGH

Very good What about Tylium

BRIDGE OFFICER

Nothing The Ovions are definitely stalling us on that

TIGH

Its as if they wanted to keep us here as long as possible Did you
see Commander Adama

BRIDGE OFFICER

No sir I didnt realize hed gone down to the surface

TIGH

Thats odd

VOICE

Sir long-range scanners are picking up a large number of ships
entering our vectors

TIGH

How long will it take them to reach our coordinates

VOICE

Theyre traveling very fastno more than a milliton

TIGH

Recall all personnel from the surface Connect me with Commander
Adama

IN AN OVION CORRIDOR

Skyler moves hurriedly along with a large party from the banquet As
they appraoch another chamber another group exits with Starbuck and
from across the corridor a thrid group exits The entire cluster
moves increasingly faster up the corridor

SKYLER

Dont panic people Starbuck hold them back Theyre going to get
hurt

But there is no containing them as they begin to hurry towards the
elevators pushing and shoving

ANTON

Please please ladies and gentlemen If we just keep together and
dont push

But Anton is pushed down submerged into a gaggle of humanity
crushing towards the elevator

SKYLER

to Starbuck caught up in the traffic

SKYLER

Its no use Starbuck Let em go Lets round up all our pilots
CLOSE ON LOTAY IN THE EMPERORS ROOM

LOTAY

We have monitored the Colonial frequencies The Warriors are being

Tigh pounds his fist in frustration
TIGH

Tigh looks troubled

IN THE OVION CHAMBERS

people run in all directions Screaming as laser shots blast the
walls all around them

ON STARBUCK

of the large room

STARBUCK

A fighter pilot runs up beside Starbuck

PILOT 2

Starbuck I found most of the guys from Red Squadron

STARBUCK

Well where are they

PILOT 2

Sealed in a chamber and theyve cut off the power to the doors
Suddenly a single cell high up in a corridor comes to life
revealing an image of Baltar The image is repeated in countless
cells down the corridor and the voice seems to reverberate from
throughout the entire complex

BALTAR

People of the Coloniesthrow down your weapons
BALTAR

in his Emperors room addressing a scanner

BALTAR

I offer you salvation Surrender or perish Your Commander has made
his choice

Adama strains against the shackles that imprison him

ADAMA

Baltaryou dare to liveto walk amongst men

BALTAR

My dear Adama provincial to the end I offer your people life You
have but a few microns to decide Even I couldnt call off the Cylon

destroyers -- once they reach your people huddled in those helpless
miserable ships
ADAMA

What trahery have you in store for your race this time

BALTAR

My dear man treachery is a matter of perspective It is the Cylons
who wish us dead not I

ADAMA

How long have you been supporting their war machine by selling them
Tylium

BALTAR

If not from me then some other source They would not be denied
ADAMA

Are you so much a fool that you believe you can trust them

BALTAR

I am prepared to continue to offer them Tylium from the planet
Carillon in return for your lives If they reject my offer I will
destroy the planet Not difficult considering its largely composed
of the most combustable material known to man

ADAMA

You expect me to accept slavery for our people

BALTAR

You are not alone amongst my prisoners Your daughter

Baltar looks off as Athena and Boxey are escorted by two Cylon
guards Athena runs from them into his arms

ATHENA

Father

Adamas hopes sink in response to the omnipoent threat

BALTAR

You must make the choice Lifeor death for her and the boyand
for your people You havent much time If you have ot chosen to live
by the time the Cylons reach you I will let you die All of you
ON THE CYLON WARRIORS

as they streak ever closer

ON STARBUCK AND SKYLER

at one end of the tunnel barriers leading out countless Colonials
men and women surrounding the pair pressing to escape

STARBUCK

Stay back

Starbuck raises his sidearm directing it towards the door

SKYLER

Back everyone

Starbuck fires Sheets of fire streak for the door erupting in
explosive direct hits Skyler runs forward and tries the door to no
avail It remains impenetrable

SKYLER

Its no good

Cries of anguish and dispair engulf the desperate humans as they
realize they are hopelessly trapped

ON ADAMA

ADAMA

All rightwell surrender

ATHENA

Fatherno

Adama directs a lethal tone at Athena

ADAMA

We have no choice

(he turns to Baltar)

What do you want me to do

BALTAR

Communicate with your fleet to send the remaining Warriors to the
surface

ADAMA

Very well

ATHENA

No FatherI cant let you do it

ADAMA

Athena your mothers life and Zacsand how many millions more
already crush me with their unholy weight I cannot accept
responsibilitiy for one more soul

(back to Baltar)

I will do as you ask

ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Adamas image appears on the scanner

ADAMA

Dispatch the last of our Warriors to the surface Colonel

Tigh looks at Adama in dismay

TIGH

But Commander that will leave us without any defenses whatsoever
ADAMA

Colonel it is only for a matter of microns We will rotate Blue and
Green Squadrons back upon their arrival

TIGH

But I really

ADAMA

Colonel that is an order Adama out

ON ADAMA IN THE CYLON CHAMBER

Athena cannout believe her ears She breaks into tears

BALTAR

breaks into a smile

ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA

Tigh paces uneasily away from the Bridge Officer who looks after him
with anxious anticipation Tigh opens an envelope and reads its
contents

BRIDGE OFFICER

At least the men will appreciate a chance to get in on the party
down there

TIGH

There inst going to be any party Ensign Tell the squadrons to
prepare for full battle attack

BRIDGE OFFICER

But the Commander

TIGH

Was merely giving me the code operative for these sealed orders

He passes them to the Bridge Officer who reads them and pales
BRIDGE OFFICER

He cant mean it

TIGH

He means it Were to attack his position with everything we have
