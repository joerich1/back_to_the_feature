Graysmith picks it up Begins reading aloud the horror
growing on his face with every sentence

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

GRAYSMITH

I like killing people because it

is so much fun It is more fun
than killing wild game in the
forest because man is the most

dangerous animal of all to kill

Something gives me the most

thrilling experience it is even
better than getting your rocks off
with a girl The best part of it

is that when I die I will be

reborn in paradise and they - They

I have killed will become my
slaves I will not give you my

name because you will try to slow

down or stop my collecting of
slaves for the afterlife

Silence Graysmith shaken

AVERY

Methinks our friend is a tad bit
fuckered in the head I heard he

even sent Vallejo a code key to

help Impatient prick isnt he

Graysmith doesnt respond Looking guilty
AVERY (CONTD)

Howd you know he was going to
send another code

GRAYSMITH
I guessed

AVERY
You guessed

GRAYSMITH

The first code was too easy

AVERY
This can no longer be ignored -
what is this youre drinking

GRAYSMITH
You wouldnt make fun of my drink
if you tried it

Avery breaking He takes the drink Takes a sip and
CUT TO

GRAYSMITH AND AVERY - Later Now both have huge blue
drinks Both buzzed now the new code in front of them He
removes a vial of coke from his coat Taps some into a dish
Rolling the tip of an unlit cigarette in it

GRAYSMITH (CONTD)
Who actually cracked the code
A married couple who like puzzles
So what does that say about
Zodiac

AVERY
Hes no expert

GRAYSMITH
Right The first one was just a
substitution code like the kind we
all did as Boy Scouts A is 1 B
is 2 and so on-

AVERY
We werent all Boy Scouts

Graysmith pulls a rumpled copy of the FIRST CIPHER from his
pocket and spreads it out on the table

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 66
105 GRAYSMITH
It looks hard but you just have to
know where to start-

AVERY
You actually carry that around
with you

GRAYSMITH
Why
AVERY
(smiling)
No reason
GRAYSMITH

What is the most common double
consonant in the English language

AVERY
Consonant

GRAYSMITH
The double L And whats the one
word we know Zodiac will use in
here

AVERY
Kill

GRAYSMITH
Exactly so the Hardens start
looking for double symbols which
they find here here and here -
each with the same two symbols
preceding them Now theyve got a
repeating four letter word ending
with two symbols they assume stand
for L-

AVERY
(getting into it)
And since they think the whole
word is Kill-

GRAYSMITH
That gives them the symbols for
K and I And theyre on their
way

AVERY

So how does someone go from A is 1
and B is 2 to this

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 67 105

GRAYSMITH
The same way I did He goes to
the library

Graysmith opens his briefcase and pulls out a STACK of
LIBRARY BOOKS Holds up the first one

GRAYSMITH (CONTD)
The Codebreakers In the
preface the author presents a
simple substitution alphabet 8
of the 26 symbols he suggests were
in the first Zodiac cipher

AVERY
What about other symbols The
medieval looking ones

GRAYSMITH
I thought they looked medieval
too Then I found a cipher used
during the Middle Ages in here
(pulls a second book)
Guess what the cipher was called
The Zodiac Alphabet

A beat Avery takes the book Looks at the page The
Zodiac Alphabet sits there many symbols identical to the
First Code Avery lights the cigarette Taking Graysmith

out of this

business for everyone but you

I dont know Dont you have
experts for that stuff

for someone to have written with

him straight if he thought Leigh
was capable of killing people-

the police that he would shoot
the tires off a school bus and
shoot the kiddies as they came

Okay Guys

Armstrong opens his notes

ARMSTRONG
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen
current residence Sunset Trailer
Court Santa Rosa California
Physical description - Allen is
similar in height weight and
build to a man seen at Lake
Berryessa the day of the
stabbings

SANTA ROSA DA
I understand he doesnt look much
like the San Francisco composite

ARMSTRONG
True his height and weight are
sketchy but lumbering Caucasian
with crewcut is right on-

TOSCHI
(breaking in)
We never had much confidence in
the composite from the kids - even
the patrolman who saw Zodiac said
he didnt look much like that
sketch

ARMSTRONG
Military bootprints - Allen was a
Navy man and wears size 10 12 the
same size found at Berryessa-

SANTA ROSA DA (0S)
What about guns

ARMSTRONG
Cheney says Allen owns several
firearms Well list them all in
the warrant

SANTA ROSA DA (0S)
And the ciphers

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

ARMSTRONG
Could be code training in the
Navy and people have seen Allen
with ciphers in the past

SANTA ROSA DA (0S)
Really who

TOSCHI
His sister in law and a guy named
Phil Tucker who he worked with at
a public pool

ARMSTRONG
Tucker also told us he had a
conversation with Allen about how
to attach a flashlight to the
barrel of a gun

CAPTAIN LEE
John thats two sources on the
ciphers and two on the flashlight

SANTA ROSA DA (0S)
What about his threats on
children

CAPTAIN LEE
Suspect worked at elementary
schools and was fired for
molestation in MarchApril 68 -
could give him motive

ARMSTRONG
At the very least its home turf
hed have knowledge of bus routes
which both threats centered
around

SANTA ROSA DA (0S)
What about the bomb

ARMSTRONG
Allen works as a chemist which
means he knows the compounds
needed to create explosives

CAPTAIN LEE
Take him through the geography

Darlene-

and printing Most of us do We
choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each

change over the years but the

unaltered Do you understand

mention both San Francisco

REPORTER
Maupin a respected author best
known for his Tales of the City
stories has gone on the record
saying he believes Toschi wrote
the letter to drum up publicity
for himself And the theory is
gaining strength Sources wishing
to remain anonymous within the
Hall of Justice say that Toschi
has always had a weak spot where
publicity was concerned

207 INT TOSCHI KITCHEN -- NIGHT

TOSCHIS WIFE on the phone with Graysmith Speaking in
hushed tones so her husband doesnt overhear INTERCUT

TOSCHIS WIFE
Maupin used David as a character
in his column David got a kick
out of it so he wrote a couple
anonymous letters asking for the
character to be brought back It
was like writing fan mail to
himself thats all But David
didnt write that letter

GRAYSMITH

I know he didnt Im sure this
will all blow over-

Blow over

She looks into the next room where Toschi sits Staring out
the window DEVASTATED

TOSCHIS WIFE (CONTD)
They kicked him out of Homicide
They made him give his handwriting
like some criminal-

GRAYSMITH
May I talk to him

TOSCHIS WIFE
No

GRAYSMITH
Then could you ask if he ever
investigated a man named Rick
Marshall

TOSCHIS WIFE
That is all you can think about

GRAYSMITH
I-

TOSCHIS WIFE

Cut off as TOSCHI takes the phone from her and HANGS IT UP

Graysmith with Narlow

NARLOW
Of course he doesnt want to talk
his careers over and your paper
did it I got half a mind to kick
you out of here myself-

GRAYSMITH
Does the name Rick Marshall mean
anything to you

This stops Narlow cold He goes and shuts his office door
Turns back to Graysmith intrigued

NARLOW
What are you after

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 158

GRAYSMITH
What have you got

NARLOW
Hypothetically You just named my
favorite suspect in the whole
case Couple years ago I was
trying to get his prints Handed
him a photo to look at He takes
it is about to hand it back when
he stops and says My goodness I
got fingerprints all over this
Then he wipes them off

GRAYSMITH
Why wasnt he ever tested for
handwriting

NARLOW

Because they finally did get his
prints and cleared him against the
one in Stines cab

GRAYSMITH
(deflating)
So its not him

NARLOW
Maybe yes maybe no

GRAYSMITH
What do you mean

NARLOW
Zodiac left gloves behind If you
have the foresight to wear gloves
while committing a murder how the
hell do you leave a fingerprint

GRAYSMITH
But it was in blood They found
it at the scene-

NARLOW
All it takes is one curious
civilian or cop to reach out and
touch something and boom - false
print Take a look at the crime
scene photos the cab wasnt that
secure

GRAYSMITH
That print was used to disqualify
thousands of suspects

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 159
208 NARLOW
Which is why we also used
handwriting

GRAYSMITH

But not with Marshall

NARLOW
SFPD had a handwritten sign from
the window of his house Looked
nothing like the Z letters so they
moved on

GRAYSMITH
What if he didnt write the sign

NARLOW
My thoughts exactly Marshall was a
Navy man received code training
He used to work as a projectionist
at a silent film theater-

Graysmith looks up

GRAYSMITH
How much do you want to bet one of
the films he projected was The
Most Dangerous Game

Silence Narlow stares at him

GRAYSMITH (CONTD)
How can I get a copy of Rick
Marshalls handwriting

NARLOW
Only three ways One get a
warrant which you cant - Two
get him to volunteer it which he
won t—

GRAYSMITH
And three

GRAYSMITH (CONTD)
Mulanax said he was your favorite
suspect That you spent two years
on him That nobody else came

TOSCHI
No because it was Sherwoods
case He was the head of
Questioned Documents If it went
to trial all the defense would
have to do is call Sherwood to the
stand - and there was no way to
get Allen into court in the first
place because there was no
evidence

GRAYSMITH
But you have him seen with
ciphers the military bootprints
the same size shoes and gloves
The Most Dangerous Game the
Zodiac watch-

TOSCHI
Robert-—

GRAYSMITH
-the background with school kids
the misspellings of Christmas
the bloody knives in the car the
connections to the murder scenes-

TOSCHI
Its all circumstantial Stines
shirt his wallet his keys - we
should have found one of those
things in that trailer We
didnt

He sighs running his hand through his hair Graysmith and
he begins digging through the folders

GRAYSMITH
Hang on a second

TOSCHI

GRAYSMITH

GRAYSMITH
You interviewed him at the
refinery Wednesday August 4th
(pause)
Hes cleaning out his trailer and
moving it to a different county 48
hours after you interviewed him

at him

GRAYSMITH (CONTD)
You have to look at this stuff
side by side

TOSCHI
What do you mean

GRAYSMITH
Allen and the Zodiac Their
timelines When was the first
murder in Vallejo

TOSCHI
Christmas of 68

GRAYSMITH
Eight months after Allens fired
for molesting children and his
family discovers he was a
pedophile When did the letters
begin

TOSCHI
July of 69

GRAYSMITH
After the second murder and they
continue until you interview
Allen Did any letters after that
contain swatches of Stines shirt

TOSCHI

GRAYSMITH
Because he dumped it He got
scared Because you went to see
him at work Whens the next time
Zodiac wrote

TOSCHI
Not until January of 1974

233F
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 187
233F 233F

GRAYSMITH
Which means hes silent for three
years after you talk to him But
by 74 he feels safe again
Everyones moved off Allen as a
suspect So Zodiac writes three
new letters - January May and

July in 74

TOSCHI
But then the letters stopped
again

GRAYSMITH

What happened to Allen

TOSCHI
He was arrested January of 75
They sent him to Atascadero We
didnt get a single letter while
he was in there

GRAYSMITH
And when is he released

TOSCHI
August of 77

GRAYSMITH

He gets out writes you and then
We get our first new Zodiac letter
in four years

(pause)
What do you think

Toschi leans forward

TOSCHI
Ive got one question

Graysmith looks at him expectantly

TOSCHI (CONTD)
Zodiac had to have known Darlene
Ferrin right

GRAYSMITH
Because of the phone calls on the
night of her murder thats right

TOSCHI
And because of this report we
know Darlene knew a man named
Lee

233F

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

GRAYSMITH
Yes

TOSCHI
All coincidence aside how can you
be sure that Leigh Allen is the
Lee in the report Vallejos a
small town but its not that
small How do you know theyre
connected

Silence Graysmith stares at him

A long beat

GRAYSMITH
This is a case thats covered both
Northern and Southern California
with suspects and victims spread
out across hundreds of miles

TOSCHI
Yes

GRAYSMITH

Allen lived in his mothers
basement on Fresno Street
Darlene worked as a waitress at
the Vallejo House of Pancakes

(pause)
Leigh Allen lived less than fifty
yards away

TOSCHI
Christ

GRAYSMITH
Do you think its him

TOSCHI
The prints and handwriting-

GRAYSMITH
Im not asking the cop Im asking
my friend - do you think its him

TOSCHI
Yes
(pause)
But we could never prove it

Just because you cant prove
something doesnt mean its not
true

Toschi looks at him Nods

TOSCHI

Toschi puts some money on the table Rises Heads for the

Graysmith enters the store Looking for someone A HEAVY
BALD CLERK stocking We see him only from behind

GRAYSMITH
Excuse me

The clerk turns and flashes a smile His nameplate reads
LEE He wears a ZODIAC WATCH on his wrist

They stand three feet apart Graysmith stares at him
Looking him in the eye Allens smile fades Realizing
why Graysmiths there He frowns His face transforms And
we see how terrifying this man really could be They hold
each others gaze for what seems like forever

And Allen finally looks away Graysmith blinks Once
Getting what he came here for Knowing for sure Graysmith
turns and walks out of the store

CUT TO
A BLACK SCREEN 242
Silence The following words appear
In 1991 Arthur Leigh Allens basement was searched by the
Vallejo Police Department In it were found bomb diagrams
explosive devices 7 handguns 4 rifles and codebooks
In order to secure the warrant Don Cheney the man who first
implicated Allen as the Zodiac was given a polygraph test
He passed with flying colors

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 194
242

Following Mike Mageaus identification of Allen as the Zodiac
Police were scheduled to meet on August 27 1992 to discuss
arresting him for the murders

Allen suffered a fatal heart attack one day before this
meeting took place No arrest was ever made

These words fade Replaced by

Inspector David Toschi retired from the San Francisco Police
Department in 1989 He was completely cleared of all charges
that he wrote the 1978 Zodiac letter

Politically destroyed by the allegation however he never
rose above the rank of Inspector

These words fade Replaced by

In 2001 DNA tests were run on several of the Zodiac
envelopes The San Francisco lab claimed DNA found under the
stamps did not match Arthur Leigh Allens

Some believe these tests exonerated Arthur Leigh Allen
Others believe Zodiac would not have licked his own stamps
since saliva typing tests were already common in 1969

In 2004 the San Francisco Police Department officially
deactivated the Zodiac investigation The Zodiac cases in
Vallejo Napa and Solano County remain open to this day
These words fade Replaced by

Today Robert Graysmith lives in San Francisco and enjoys a
healthy relationship with his children Many people believe

he was wrong in his conclusions on the Zodiac case

The anonymous phone calls he was receiving abruptly ceased in
1992 Not a single one has occurred since Allens death
