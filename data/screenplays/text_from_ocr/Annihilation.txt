ANNIHILATION

Alex Garland V10
OPEN ON -

EXT OUTER SPACE

- blackness and stars

In the stars a lump of rock and ice moving through space
leaving a trail of dust and ice crystals

Locked deep inside the ice blue-green iridescence
Rotate around the METEOR to reveal -
- the MOON

Float past the bone-white orb over the Sea Of Tranquility
to reveal -

- Earth Blue-green jewel

Race towards the planet

Start to blaze as we hit the atmosphere
Lighting up like phosphorus

curt TO -

EXT OUTER ATMOSPHERE - NIGHT

- the METEOR burning in the outer atmosphere of Earth
The integrity of the rock and ice suddenly gives way
The body fragments

curt TO -

EXT LOWER ATMOSPHERE - NIGHT

- the meteor fragments separating drifting away
Most pieces burn away to nothing

Until there is only one

Racing down towards the OCEAN

On which we find a COAST LINE

And then a LIGHTHOUSE
EXT LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

The meteor has almost burned to nothing before it impacts

What was a vast lump of extraterrestrial rock is now barely

an ember

A SPARK

Then it hits the ground by the LIGHTHOUSE
Grilling into the earth like a bullet hole
CuT TO -

- an alien form

A creature from another world

It has tendrils It shimmers with iridescent colour It has

immense fractal complexity in its shape

And it’s moving Gently like a sea anemone in a swell

Beats pass
Then we hear a woman’s voice

WOMAN (0S)
This is a cell

As we watch the alien creature starts to divide

WOMAN (0S) (CONT’D)
Like all cells it derived from an
existing cell

The creature is now half-way through the division
into a mirror of itself

WOMAN (0S) (CONT’D)
By extension all cells were
ultimately derived from one cell
A single organism alone on planet
Earth perhaps alone in the
universe about four billion years
ago

The creature completes its division

separating

Immediately its two halves start the same process again

WOMAN (0S) (CONTD)
One became two Two became four
Then eight Sixteen Thirty two
(MORE)
WOMAN (0S) (CONT’D)
The rhythm of the dividing pair
which becomes the structure of
every microbe blade of grass sea
creature land creature and human
The structure of everything that
lives -

INT JOHNS HOPKINS MEDICAL SCHOOLSEMINAR ROOM - DAY

- LENA KERANS

Thirty years old Recently completed her doctorate now
teaching a seminar class of first-year MEDICAL STUDENTS

LENA
- and everything that dies

Beat

LENA (CONTD)
As students of medicine as the
doctors of tomorrow that’s where
you come in

She gestures to the screen behind her - which shows the
electron microscope images that we have been watching

LENA (CONTD)
The cell you’ve been looking at is
from a tumour Female patient
early thirties taken from her
cervix Over the course of the
coming term

LENA pauses

A couple of the MED STUDENTS look up from their note-taking
aware of the silence -

- and see that their tutor has been momentarily distracted
Her head is turned to the window -

- where outside above the tree tops a FULL MOON hangs in
the blue sky

The image of the MOON in daylight is gently surreal
Arresting because the sky is so cloudless and clear

Almost absently LENA’S hand goes to her neck and her
fingers lightly touch a SILVER LOCKET that hangs from a
slender chain

As the silence extends the STUDENTS exchange a glance

Then LENA’S focus returns Becomes aware she has zoned out

LENA (CONT’D)
-- Excuse me

She picks up the thread

LENA (CONTD)
Over the course of the coming term
we will be closely examining these
cancer cells in vitro and
observing autophagic activity

EXT JOHNS HOPKINS MEDICAL SCHOOLCAMPUS - DAY

LENA walks across the campus
A man in his forties jogs up to her
DANIEL MAITLAND

DANIEL
Lena

LENA
Dan

LENA doesn’t break stride so he falls in beside her
DANIEL

I keep looking for you at lunch
but you never seem to be around

LENA
I’ve been catching up on some
writing

DANIEL
All work and no play It’s not
healthy

LENA keeps walking

DANIEL (CONT’D)
I wanted to ask Do you have plans
Saturday

LENA
- Saturday

DANIEL
Sarah and I have a few people
coming over A garden party while
the weather holds

LENA gives the neutral frown of someone prepping a polite
excuse
LENA
You mean this Saturday
DANIEL
Yes
LENA
Actually I do have something
planned
DANIEL

Are you sure I think it’ll be a
lot of fun We’ve asked Amir and
Jenny and -

LENA
(cuts in)
Thanks Dan I appreciate it But
I was going to paint our bedroom
LENA corrects herself immediately

LENA (CONTD)
The bedroom

DANIEL looks at LENA
DANIEL
It’s been a year Lena Youre
allowed to come to a barbecue

DANIEL reaches out

Catches LENA’S arm

Stops her
DANIEL (CONTD)
It’s not a betrayal Not an insult
to his memory
Beat

LENA
I’m going to paint the bedroom

DANIEL gives way Removes his hand

DANIEL
Home improvements

LENA smiles perfunctorily

LENA
Yes
EXT SUBURB - DAY

Bright flat sunlight pushes through tree tops
A broad road Detached houses Green lawns

Two children on push-bikes glide down the sidewalk

INT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A quiet house
Stillness in the rooms

Photographs in the BEDROOM show a couple LENA with a man
in his early thirties KANE

KANE is a soldier Images show him in uniform with
comrades in a baked landscape of rock and dust

He smiles easily at the camera Full of life in these frozen
snapshots

One of the images shows a wedding LENA in white The
couple embracing

Another shows the couple in Verona Perhaps the honeymoon

INT HOUSELIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

LENA sits on the sofa

Legs curled beneath her

In one hand she holds her SILVER LOCKET
It’s open Inside is a PHOTO of KANE
She gazes at it

We can feel LENA’S effort to modulate her breathing
Inhaling and exhaling through parted lips

Less controlled tears spill down her face Down her cheeks
and neck Into the corner of her mouth

TITLE

ANNIHILATION

Then into the quiet and stillness MUSIC intrudes
curt TO -

INT HOUSEGARAGE - DAY

- the garage Full of dust and boxes and junk

LENA pulls stuff from shelves On a mission Searching for
a particular half-collapsed cardboard box

Inside tins of paint and a roller

curt TO -

INT HOUSEBEDROOM - DAY

- the speakers from which the MUSIC is playing

- the framed photographs of LENA and KANE which are now off
the walls and stacked on the landing

- a PLASTIC SHEET as it rises up billows then settles over
the DOUBLE BED

- a flathead screwdriver pushes under the rim of a tub of
paint and pops the lid

LENA runs a primed roller over the wall Leaving a fat white
stripe over the old colour Flecking her shirt and face with
paint Smearing it off her forehead with the back of her
hand

Repainting the room is an act of moving on

She is energised Focused

So focused -

- that she doesn’t see the figure that appears in the doorway
of the bedroom

KANE

He seems different to the photos In uniform but bloodless
in his complexion Older in his gaze

He watches LENA painting

Oddly blank Not announcing his presence -

- until she turns needing to reload the roller -
- and sees him

First she jolts at the sight of the figure

Second she recognises him
LENA
(whispers)
Oh God
The roller slips from her hand
Lands with a wet slap on the floor

She walks towards KANE

Puts a hand on his cheek in the way she might touch a clear
window to see if it holds a pane of glass

Then she grabs his face with both palms Kissing him as she
talks

LENA (CONTD)
Oh God oh God - I thought you were
gone - gone forever - forever
She’s crying laughing
He isn’t
CuT TO -

- the two of them falling down to the paint-flecked plastic
sheet over the double bed

LENA on top pulling off her shirt pulling at KANE’S belt
and trousers

They start making love

But her passion remains completely unmatched by him He is
glazed and distant No more than compliant

Until finally -

- she has to acknowledge it

She breaks off

Hurt confused Looking down at him
LENA (CONTD)

Kane

INT HOUSEKITCHEN - NIGHT

KANE sits at the table
In front of him is a glass of water
He stares at the clear liquid but doesn’t drink it

LENA stands by the counter

Confusion has transformed now into frustration and anger

LENA
You must be able to tell me
something Vanished off the face
of the Earth for twelve months I
deserve a better explanation
than no explanation

KANE doesn’t answer

LENA (CONTD)

No one knew anything about your
unit I contacted everyone
Everyone I could The other wives
and partners knew as little as me

Beat

LENA (CONTD)
Was it covert

KANE
-- Maybe

LENA
What does that mean ‘maybe’

KANE
Okay yes Covert I think so

LENA
Pakistan again

KANE
No

LENA
Yemen

KANE

I can’t tell you

LENA
So it is classified

KANE
I mean I can’t tell you I don’t
know where it was Or

He trails off
LENA frowns

LENA
You’re telling me you don’t know
where you’ve been How can that
even be possible Was it hot
(MORE )

LENA (CONTD)
Was there snow Did the people
speak Swahili or Portuguese or
Pashto
KANE says nothing

LENA processes for a beat Fighting back the strangeness of
the conversation Trying to assert reason

LENA (CONTD)
How long have you been back

KANE
I don’t know

LENA
Well - how did you get back Which
base did they fly you to

KANE
I don’t know

LENA
What about the rest of your unit
Did they return with you

For the first time we see something tangible in KANE A
helplessness A dimly understood fear

KANE
I don’t know

Silence

As LENA suddenly understands her husband is profoundly
damaged His body has returned to her but not his mind

She takes a seat opposite him at the table
Then takes his hand He doesn’t resist

LENA
Kane

He looks at her

LENA (CONTD)
How did you get home

KANE
I

He breaks off a moment

KANE (CONTD)
I was outside

LENA
Outside the house

KANE
No Outside the bedroom Just
upstairs on the landing The door

was open and I saw you
Beat
KANE (CONTD)
I remembered you I remembered
your face
Silence

Then KANE detaches his hand from LENA’S

He reaches for the glass of water

Takes a single sip

Then puts the glass back down

REVEAL —

- in the water a strand of blood hangs Suspended
It can only be from inside KANE’S mouth

KANE looks up at LENA

KANE (CONTD)
I don’t think I’m very well

curt TO -

INT AMBULANCE - NIGHT

- the interior of an AMBULANCE driving fast through the
night streets SIREN howling

KANE - strapped to a stretcher in the back rolled-back eyes
half-raised - vomits blood

A PARAMEDIC tries to support him with one arm while speaking
urgently into a radio

PARAMEDIC
Male thirty one hemorrhage in
seizure Wife reports confused
state Possible concussion but no
sign of head wound

Kneeling by KANE LENA wipes at the blood on his face Tries
to hold his lolling head

LENA
Baby baby stay with me -

PARAMEDIC
Prepare emergency team for ETA in
six mikes -

Suddenly -

- the PARAMEDIC is interrupted by a second SIREN joining the
first Then a THIRD and FOURTH

Blue lights start pulsing through the windows

Above the sirens the PARAMEDIC shouts to the AMBULANCE
DRIVER

PARAMEDIC (CONTD)
Did you call for a police escort

AMBULANCE DRIVER
They aren’t police

PARAMEDIC
What the Hell

The PARAMEDIC looks out of the window
As he does so -

- the interior of the ambulance is flooded with BLINDING
WHITE LIGHT and a ROAR OF ENGINE NOISE

From LENA’S bleached face disorientated by the horror and
sensory overload CUT TO -

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

- the street outside the ambulance where the reason for the
noise and light is explained

The AMBULANCE is flanked by three black SUVs and above it a
HELICOPTER

No more than four metres off the ground
Shining a spotlight straight down at the front windscreen

curt TO -

INT AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

- the AMBULANCE DRIVER -

AMBULANCE DRIVER
Jesus Christ

- dazzled slamming his foot on the brakes -

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

- sending the vehicle into a skid -

INT AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

- which slams LENA and the PARAMEDIC hard against the wall of
the vehicle

The semi-conscious KANE is held fast by the stretcher straps

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

- the AMBULANCE skids to a stop
The SUVs expertly slide to halt around it

Then immediately disgorge UNIFORMED ARMED MEN Black gear
stubby semi-automatic machine guns SPEC OPS

The SPEC OPS soldiers pull open the rear doors of the
ambulance

Drag out LENA and the PARAMEDIC

In the FOREGROUND the HELICOPTER lands in the road
Obscuring our vision and deafening us

Through the obliterating rotor blade wash we can hear LENA
LENA
(screaming)
What are you doing Let him go
Let him go
CuT TO -
- LENA fighting as two of the SPEC OPS try to hold her
- the PARAMEDIC and DRIVER being dragged out of view
- KANE pulled on his stretcher from the AMBULANCE

- something jammed into LENA’S neck A one-hit disposable
syringe

The tranquiliser drops to the floor as the fight bleeds out
of LENA Then consciousness

Sound and light fade as the sedative takes over

BLACK SCREEN

CAPTION

PART ONE - THE SOUTHERN REACH

curt TO -

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYINTERVIEW ROOM

- a view of door Set into a concrete wall in an otherwise
featureless and windowless room

Silence except the sound of breathing

REVEAL LENA

She is sat on a chair on one side of a table She wears the
same clothes we last saw her in But time has passed
Several hours at least The blood of her husband is now
dried black stiffened on the material of her short and
trousers rusted and flaking on her hands

She is trembling

Beats pass

Then the door UNLOCKS startling LENA

REVEALING a woman in her late-forties

This is DR VENTRESS

Glasses Suit Smiling

She’s holding a small plastic bottle of mineral water

DR VENTRESS
Hello

DR VENTRESS enters the room and closes the door - which locks
behind her

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
You probably feel dreadful
Queasy A nasty metal taste in the
mouth Headache
LENA looks at her

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
Would you like some water

The doctor holds out the plastic bottle
LENA hesitates

Then with slightly uncertain fingers takes it
Opens it

Has a sip

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
That’s better isn’t it

LENA returns the woman’s gaze

LENA
Who are you

DR VENTRESS
I’m a psychologist

LENA
What does that mean

DR VENTRESS
That I study people’s emotional
states

LENA

I know what a fucking psychologist
is I’m asking why am I talking
to one

DR VENTRESS
Because I’m in charge of the
facility you’re in

LENA
- I’m in a psychiatric hospital

DR VENTRESS

LENA
Then what Where am I And
where’s my husband

DR VENTRESS ignores the questions She takes the chair
opposite LENA and sits down

DR VENTRESS
You’re a biologist

LENA
So what

DR VENTRESS
You completed a doctorate at Johns
Hopkins

(MORE )

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
Your research area is the
genetically programmed life-cycle
of the cell Is it fascinating

LENA leans forwards Enunciates

LENA
Where is my husband

DR VENTRESS
Yes Let’s talk about him
Sergeant Kane When did he arrive

home

LENA
That depends how long I’ve been
here

DR VENTRESS says nothing

LENA (CONTD)
I think it was yesterday

DR VENTRESS
Had he contacted you at any point
over the last few months

LENA

No He left on - whatever he was

doing Whatever spec-ops mission
That was the last I heard until he
reappeared

DR VENTRESS
He didn’t tell you what he was
doing Or where he was going

LENA
He never did I never asked

DR VENTRESS
But you made regular requests for
information about him to his unit
co until six months ago Then you
stopped Why was that

LENA
Because we had an agreement
Between us Six months of radio
silence meant I was to assume he
was dead And move on

DR VENTRESS gives a sympathetic nod

DR VENTRESS
It’s not easy to move on
Silence

LENA
I didn’t

LENA sits back in her chair

LENA (CONTD)

You know what I think I just
figured you out Youre CIA

And Kane was on some kind of
operation for you And you believe
he told me something before he got
sick

LENA fixes the woman opposite with an even gaze

A pause

LENA (CONTD)

So let’s cut the shit I’m done
answering questions It’s your
turn

DR VENTRESS
I’m not CIA but I used to be And
your husband is in the same
building as you And I should tell
you he’s extremely ill

LENA catches her breath But stays composed

Beat

LENA
I1l in what way

DR VENTRESS
We don’t actually know He doesn’t
test positive for any known
condition - but objectively his
body is hemorrhaging and his organs
are failing

LENA
He’s dying

DR VENTRESS
Yes

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
We have him on life-support in an
induced cold-coma His metabolism
is slowed nearly to a stop It
gives a degree of time

LENA
He must have been exposed to
something

DR VENTRESS adds nothing

LENA (CONTD)
Radiation A virus of some sort

LENA leans forwards

LENA (CONTD)

For Christ’s sake - I might
actually be able to help him You
have to tell me where has he been
and what was he doing

DR VENTRESS
I can’t talk about that You
understand

LENA
Clearly I dont

DR VENTRESS
You understand that I’m not going
to talk about it

The doctor stands

The door unbolts in anticipation of her exit

As it swings open it reveals a SPEC OPS SOLDIER standing
guard in the corridor outside

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
Ill be back later

LENA
You still haven’t told me anything
about what’s going on or what I’m
doing here
DR VENTRESS has reached the door

DR VENTRESS
Well speak again

LENA stands
LENA
At least let me change out of these
clothes

DR VENTRESS pauses

LENA holds up her hands

LENA (CONTD)
I’m covered in my husbands blood

curt TO -

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYSHOWER

- LENA under a shower stream washing the blood from her
body From her hair Fingernails

REVEAL the shower space Another windowless room Tiled
walls and floors A military feel or prison Rows of un-
partitioned shower-heads

An ORANGE JUMPSUIT is folded on a changing bench A pair of
white sneakers are beneath it

At the door of the shower room an armed SPEC-OPS SOLDIER
stands guard

His back is to the room to protect LENA’S modesty

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYCORRIDOR

LENA walks down a corridor back towards the interview room
Wearing the jumpsuit and sneakers

The SPEC OPS soldier walks slightly behind
LENA glances back at him
SEES SOMETHING

On his belt a clip containing two of the one-hit SYRINGE
VIALS that were used to sedate her

LENA
Do you know my husband Sergeant
Kane
The SPEC OPS SOLDIER doesn’t react
LENA (CONTD)
Just wondering if you’ve served
together You are the 427th
right
The SPEC OPS SOLDIER stops by the door to the interview room
SPEC OPS SOLDIER

Just here please ma’am

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYINTERVIEW ROOM

LENA stops in the door frame

LENA
I just want to know what’s happened
to him

SPEC OPS SOLDIER
Enter the room ma’am

But rather than take a step back she takes a step forwards
towards the soldier

Her eyes brim

LENA
Please

SPEC OPS SOLDIER
Ma’am

A tear spills

Her hand touches the soldier’s chest in the way she touched
KANES chest

LENA
If you know anything at all can’t
you just -
It’s a ploy
There is a SUDDEN fluid motion

With her other hand LENA has unclipped one of the
TRANQUILISERS

In a FLASH it’s up and jammed into the soldier’s neck

SPEC OPS SOLDIER
Ah Bitch - you -

His hand claws at the vial Knocks it out

All too late He exhales Folds Falling forwards into the
room

As he hits the concrete CUT TO -

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYCORRIDOR

- LENA bolting the interview room door closed

She looks left Right

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYCORRIDOR

LENA walk-runs through the facility Silent on the linoleum
floor in her white sneakers

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYELEVATOR LOBBY

LENA enters an elevator lobby

She goes straight to the control panel and hits the call
button

Nothing happens

Beside the panel is a glass plate with the outline of a
hand The elevator requires a palm-print biometric pass

LENA
- Shit

AT THAT MOMENT startling LENA the elevator CHIMES
The car has just arrived on this floor

As the doors start to open CUT TO -

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYELEVATOR

- inside the elevator where DR VENTRESS is arguing with a
SPEC OPS CAPTAIN

DR VENTRESS
While the facility remains under my
command the way I structure the
team is my business Captain

They exit the elevator into the lobby -

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYELEVATOR LOBBY

- without noticing LENA pressed to the wall just out of
their line of sight

SPEC OPS CAPTAIN
In forty eight hours it won’t be
under your command It’1l be under
Pentagon control where it should
be

DR VENTRESS
So take it up with Washington By
the time you’ve found anyone with
the authority to stop me we’ll be
gone

As they walk away LENA slips inside the elevator just as
the doors start closing

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYELEVATOR

Inside the elevator LENA hurriedly scans the different floor
options

It’s LENA’S first geographical indication of where she is
There are four levels in the building One below ground and
three above

B is SECURITY

is LOBBY

1 is RESEARCH

2 is LIVING
By the digital readout she is on B

LENA
‘Southern Reach’ What the Hell

LENA hesitates over the panel for a moment

Then hits the LOBBY button

Nothing happens

She hits it again

Nothing

Sees - beside the control panel another BIOMETRIC READER

LENA (CONTD)
Oh shit

She touches the biometric pad
An error code sounds

LENA (CONTD)
Come on please No no no

A terrible sense that she has managed to escape from a small
locked room into an even smaller one

Then SUDDENLY -

- the elevator starts moving

On the digital panel the numbers start moving upwards
Past the lobby - to level 1 Where it stops

The doors OPEN revealing a man in a white lab coat A

SCIENTIST of some sort His head is dropped reading through
a sheaf of forms which he is filling out

LENA stands back straight against the wall terrified to
meet his gaze

But he hardly seems to notice her Just touches the
biometric pad and presses the button for Level 2

The doors close The elevator starts moving again
Then still without raising his head the SCIENTIST speaks

SCIENTIST
Man the bureaucracy of this place

LENA knows a response is needed Doesn’t want to give the
man an excuse to look up

LENA
Tell me about it

SCIENTIST
Need to fill out an application
just to have a nervous breakdown
This feels like it can be met with silence
Then a beat later the doors chime

And open -

- REVEALING a large room thronged with people and a buzz of
conversation

SCIENTIST (CONTD)
After you

LENA has no choice but to walk out

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYMESS HALL - DAY

LENA has entered into the MESS HALL of the facility

It is packed with SOLDIERS SCIENTISTS and ADMINISTRATIVE
STAFF

They sit at tables chatting Carry trays with food and
drinks

On the far side of the room there is a floor to ceiling
glass wall through which for the first time in the facility
we see DAYLIGHT

Bright burnished gold

In the middle of the wall is an open double door leading to
the outside

She realises at once she has to make it across the room to
that door To the exterior the sunlight It’s the only
exit apart from the elevator from which she has just come

But among the uniforms and lab coats and suits there is only
one person wearing an orange jumpsuit

LENA
She takes a breath And simply starts walking
Not hurried not slow Not drawing attention to herself

And for a moment it seems as if it might work The people
around simply don’t notice her

Then -

- someone looks at her

A WOMAN sat at a table

She frowns

Taps the arm of the person beside her
LENA starts walking quicker

WOMAN
- Hey

LENA ignores her Walks faster for the door and the
sunlight

WOMAN (CONTD)
HEY

LENA breaks into a run

One of the SOLDIERS ahead turns Sees Tries to block her
path

LENA jumps onto one of the long refectory tables Runs down
the length scattering food and drinks

Someone tries to catch her leg
She jumps over them
Is nearly at the double doors

Two SCIENTISTS try to block her and she has no choice but to
go straight through them knocking them flying

And then -

- she is through the doors and out

EXT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYVIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

LENA makes only five or six steps into the sunlight

Then -

- slows

And stops

Arrested by the view in front of her

REVEAL that LENA is standing on a VIEWING PLATFORM
Essentially a massive balcony which projects from the MESS
HALL three stories above the ground

And the facility from which she has escaped turns out to a
kind of gatehouse structure - like a medieval castle dragged
into a brutalist Twenty First Century

Either side of the facility a concrete wall extends
Massive buttressed punctuated with watch towers It looks
designed to contain or defend against something mythic in

scale

This would be a stunning sight in its own right - but it’s
the view from the platform that stopped LENA in her tracks

It shows a landscape behind which the sun sets

A stretch of bare ground for a few hundred yards beyond the
concrete wall leading to a dense forest

And in front of - or permeating - the forest there is a
shimmer

Similar to a heat haze - it gives a glassy liquid quality to
everything seen through its prism

But unlike a heat haze - and like a prism - it splits light
So through the shimmer -

- the sun distorts into a deliquescing orange orb fringed
with chromatic aberrations of blue and green

- the colours on the clouds split into a full rainbow
spectrum spread across the sky like psychedelic Northern
Lights

- the trees in the forest distort gently as if pushed by a
gentle wind that eases the trunks into movement as if they
were as light as leaves

SPEC OPS SOLDIER (0S)
GET ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW

REVEAL behind LENA an arc of three SPEC OPS SOLDIERS all
pointing their guns at the back of her head

But before the moment can unravel DR VENTRESS appears
pushing past the soldiers brushing down their gun barrels as

if warding away a wasp

DR VENTRESS
Is there really any need for that

SPEC OPS SOLDIER
Sir she -

DR VENTRESS
(cuts in)
Shut up and step away Give us
space

The soldiers do as ordered

Throughout LENA hasn’t turned from the fauvist view

The doctor steps beside her

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
It’s obvious what your husband saw
in you Impressive to have
escaped To this point at least

LENA talks as if through a dream

LENA
Where am I

DR VENTRESS

Northern Florida Thirty miles
from the coast It was the
Blackwater State Park but we now
call it the Southern Reach

LENA
Why is a National Park sealed
behind a fifty metre high concrete
wall

DR VENTRESS
Well quite That is the question

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYCOMMAND CENTER - DAY

The COMMAND CENTER of the Southern Reach Facility

A large room with one wall given over to a floor-to ceiling
window which faces the landscape and the Shimmer

In the middle of the room is a large digital map It shows
the coast of Northern Florida the boundary wall of the
Southern reach facility and - in illuminated blue - the
border of the Shimmer

On the adjacent wall there is a collection of images

Some show a tall white LIGHTHOUSE - with archive
architectural plans of the building The rest are a sequence
of TEAM PHOTOS Small groups of men and women with backpacks
and hiking gear Some with weapons and uniforms

LENA walks to the digital map table
DR VENTRESS standing by the window starts to talk

DR VENTRESS
It started when a park guide
reported an event to the local
police A lighthouse on the coast
was surrounded by what he called a
‘shimmer’ A friend of his had
entered to find out what was going
on - and never returned

Beat

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
That was thirteen years ago We
evacuated the area and concocted a
cover story - an accident on a
cargo ship carrying nuclear waste
Then we set up a covert body to
investigate the phenomena And
three hundred billion dollars
later we know nothing more than
was contained in that first brief
police report

Behind the doctor the landscape undulates and refracts

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
Something goes in and it doesn’t
come back And I’m not just
talking about people Drones
robots animals birds radio
waves radar particle streams
It’s a black hole Nothing gets
out

Beat

LENA
You have no idea what it is

DR VENTRESS
We have many An extra terrestrial
event a multi-dimensional event
(MORE )

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
a religious event The ideas are
endless What we lack are facts

DR VENTRESS has joined LENA at the map She indicates the
border of the shimmer Concentric circles - like tree rings -
dated by year

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
Area ‘X’ The only thing we can
say for certain is that it’s
getting bigger Initially it
enclosed the lighthouse and an area
of about fifty square metres It
now covers an area the size of
Chicago

LENA looks the dated bands Sees the expanding gap between
the most recent circles

LENA
The expansion rate is increasing

DR VENTRESS
Exponentially In five years the
Shimmer will encompass the Southern
United States and most of Mexico

LENA
- And in ten years

DR VENTRESS
The planet

LENA looks back at DR VENTRESS

LENA
Does the planet get to hear about
this

DR VENTRESS
Does it matter

DR VENTRESS traces her finger over the glowing blue Shimmer
bands on the map

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
It makes me think of cancer The
invasion The spread If the
cancer is terminal is it better to
know

LENA
Id want to know

DR VENTRESS
Yes but is it better to know

LENA walks to the TEAM PHOTOS

Starts scanning the faces
DR VENTRESS watches Then indicates with her hand

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
He’s over there

LENA sees KANE
In a group of spec ops soldiers Similar to the images at
home - her husband is smiling looking straight at the
camera an Armalite rifle held loosely in his hands
DR VENTRESS (CONTD)

Twenty three expeditions A

hundred and thirteen men and women

And only he came back
Beat

LENA
Will you let me see him

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYMEDICAL CENTRE - DAY

KANE lies on a bed Surrounded by the tubes lines and the
machinery of life support

His skin is almost the colour of ivory
His heartbeat monitor shows four beats per minute
LENA stands beside him She exhales and steam wreathes her

DR VENTRESS watches from behind an observation window The
edges of the glass are frosted with ice crystals

LENA reaches for KANE’S hand

Holds it
A tear slips out of her eye

And freezes on her cheek

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYMEDICAL CENTRE - DAY

LENA joins the DR VENTRESS on her side of the observation
window

LENA
How long can you keep him alive
like this
A beat

DR VENTRESS
If he could stay here maybe
months But I’m afraid there’s a
complication The Shimmer will
soon extend to where we’re standing
right now The facility is
preparing to relocate -

LENA
- and he won’t survive the move

DR VENTRESS
«e- No

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
I don’t think either of us will as
it happens

LENA
What do you mean

DR VENTRESS
Southern Reach has failed in its
objectives and I’m about to be
relieved of command Before that
happens I’ve authorised a final
mission into Area X And this
time I’m going to lead it

DR VENTRESS pauses

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
I’m like you Lena The cancer may
be terminal but I need to know I
need to see what happened in the
lighthouse with my own eyes

LENA processes

Then speaks

LENA
When do you leave

DR VENTRESS
Tomorrow morning

LENA
How many in the team

DR VENTRESS
Four

LENA looks evenly at the doctor

LENA
Five

Beat

DR VENTRESS
Lena -

LENA
(cuts in)
He’s my husband He’s dying

DR VENTRESS
And you’1l go in there and find a
cure I think the chances are
slim

LENA
The chances are zero if I don’t
even try I owe it to him

DR VENTRESS
(echoes )
You owe it

LENA
Yes

Beat

DR VENTRESS
Well in any case it’s not simply
a question of your motivation
There are processes to observe
Evaluations and -

LENA
(cuts in)
While the facility remains under
your command the way you structure
the team is your business

DR VENTRESS knows she has been quoted from her exchange with
the SPEC OPS CAPTAIN but isn’t quite sure how it could have
happened

She smiles faintly

DR VENTRESS
-- Good point

Beat

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
I have to admit a biologist would
be an ideal addition to the
expedition’s skill-set And the
team is short-handed

(MORE)

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
Given the track record it hasn’t
been easy to find volunteers

LENA waits letting the doctor talk herself round

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
If you were to join us I don’t
think it would be wise to explain
your connection to the previous
mission It might not be
helpful To the group dynamic

LENA turns to the glass

Looks back at the near motionless body of her husband

LENA
Whatever it takes

curt TO -

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYFIRING RANGE - DAY

- a FIRING RANGE in which a woman is firing an automatic
rifle straight at us

Her name is ANYA THORENSEN She’s a handsome woman in her
mid-thirties Close-cropped hair wearing a white vest that
shows muscled arms Obviously lifts weights

She has a very distinctive TATTOO encircling her forearm
depicting an ouroboros - a snake eating its tail

curt TO -

- a TARGET with BULLET HOLES appearing Loosely grouped
but finding their mark

CuT TO -

- the woman firing in the next alley

This is CASS SHEPPARD She’s in her mid-forties Glasses
pony-tail efficiently tied back Could be a mother at school
gates if not for the automatic rifle

CuT TO -

- a similar spread of BULLET HOLES appearing on a target

CuT TO -

- the next alley where we find JOSIE RADEK

RADEK is in her mid-twenties but feels younger She has the

sheltered quality that people have when they’ve passed
straight from school to college to doctorate

She’s having trouble with her weapon She looks frightened
by the recoil leaning her face away from the stock and
convulsively screwing her eyes as the gun starts firing
CuT TO -

- a near random spray of rounds that hit in various places
but not the target

CuT TO -

— LENA

Stepping up to the fourth alley in the firing range
Lifting a rifle Squeezing the trigger

She keeps the gun steady fires in neat three round bursts
and the stock pushed tight up against her cheek bone

curt TO -

- a neat grouping of rounds appearing in the middle of the
target

CUT TO -
- DR VENTRESS Observing
She shifts her gaze to THORENSEN SHEPPARD and RADEK -

- who are clearly surprised to find this new person in the
fourth firing alley

LENA empties the last rounds in her clip

The final volley of gunshots leave a ringing echo in the
concrete chamber

Broken by DR VENTRESS

DR VENTRESS
Team

The women remove their ear defenders

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
Id like to introduce Lena Kerans
a biologist we have sequestered
from Johns Hopkins to join us on
the mission to the lighthouse Ms
Kerans meet Anya Thorensen a
medic Cass Sheppard a geologist
And Josie Radek a physicist

Beat

Then LENA lifts a hand

LENA
ee Hi

EXT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITY - NIGHT

The facility is picked out in the moonlight

A row of FLOODLIGHTS along the perimeter wall illuminate the
wasteground and the tree line

Stars vibrate through the Shimmer

EXT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYVIEWING PLATFORM - NIGHT

LENA stands on the viewing platform leaning against the
guard rail

She’s holding the SILVER LOCKET containing KANE’S PHOTO in
her hand Gazing at it

A few metres away RADEK and SHEPPARD sit at a table

SHEPPARD is studying one of her maps and RADEK is making
notes in a small pad

THORENSEN appears beside LENA
She’s holding a pair of binoculars

LENA gazing at the locket her head many miles away doesn’t
notice

THORENSEN
Hey

LENA looks up snapped back to focus -

- and closes the locket with a soft snap before THORENSEN
can see the image inside

LENA
-- Oh hey

THORENSEN
Wasn’t meaning to pry

LENA
No - it’s just -

THORENSEN holds up a hand
THORENSEN
It’s cool No need to explain I

just saw you over here and

THORENSEN shrugs
THORENSEN (CONTD)
I don’t know I was thinking
we should bond or something
Considering we’re travel buddies

LENA
You bet

LENA slips the necklace back over her head

LENA (CONTD)
Have you been at the facility a
long time

THORENSEN
Nearly a year now I was a
paramedic in Chicago Tried to
join MSF thinking I’d work out in
Asia or something But my
application got flagged by some
computer system and Southern Reach
got in touch That chime with how
they got to you

LENA
Yeah Similar story

LENA nods towards the Shimmer

LENA (CONTD)
Do you ever get used to the view

THORENSEN laughs

Beat

THORENSEN
It’s weird The Shimmer is the
strangest thing I’ve ever seen
Like - what’s the Grand Canyon to
this But at the same time you do
kind of get used to it You have
to accept it because it’s there

LENA
I have a question
THORENSEN
Shoot
LENA

Why’s our team all women

THORENSEN
Affirmative action It’s an
important part of the struggle that
women get equal opportunity to go
on suicide missions

THORENSEN holds up her fist

THORENSEN (CONTD)
Yes sister

LENA bumps it
THORENSEN smiles

THORENSEN (CONT’D)
It’s also because they think a team
of women might have a better chance
of survival than a team that
includes men

LENA
I don’t follow

THORENSEN
There’s two theories about what
goes wrong inside Area X One
something in there kills them
Two they kill each other Theory
one favours a male team all big
and butch armed to the teeth
Theory two favours a female team
Less propensity to violence And
so far the male teams have been
shit out of luck

LENA looks at THORENSEN Sees this is for real

LENA
They really think the previous
expeditions might have killed each
other

THORENSEN
It’s a little more than they just
‘think’ it You know there’s a guy
who made it back The only one
They’ve got him in an induced coma
in the med center

LENA
- I did hear that

THORENSEN
So technically he wasn’t the first
to walk out of Area X He was the
second

LENA frowns

LENA
The second

THORENSEN hands LENA her binoculars then gestures out across
the deforested area towards the tree line

THORENSEN
Check your ten o’clock about
twenty metres from the tree line

LENA raises the binoculars and looks where THORENSEN has
indicated

Sees a bundle of rags and white bone At this distance the
bleached dome of skull is the only thing that allow us to
understand it was a human

THORENSEN (CONTD)
See the bones

LENA
oe Yes

THORENSEN
He’s been laid there about six
months now Too far away to
positively ID but from his
uniform they know he was on the
previous mission

FLASHBACK TO -

EXT THE SHIMMERTREELINE - DAY

- LONG LENS on the trees
A MAN walks out Unarmed Wearing the SPEC OPS uniform
Through the mirage distortion he seems to have a long beard
THORENSEN (0S)
ae strolled out the forest one

Even at this distance the MAN seems slightly dazed Or
uncertain

THORENSEN (0S) (CONTD)
Didn’t seem in a hurry Stood a
while Started walking

The MAN takes a few steps in the direction of the distant
wall

THORENSEN (0S) (CONT’D)
Then -

Rapid puffs of red from the MAN’S head and chest Noiseless

THORENSEN (0S) (CONTD)
- pop

Followed by the delayed crack of the rifle retorts

curt TO -

EXT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYVIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

- LENA lowering the binoculars

LENA
No one saw who did it

THORENSEN shakes her head

THORENSEN
No But we all got our ideas

LENA looks at THORENSEN Waiting
THORENSEN (CONT’D)
Well - it’s got to have been the
guy that got out right The one
they’re keeping in the freeze box

Beat

THORENSEN (CONTD)
Lieutenant Kane

On LENA processing this

CUT FROM the night view -

EXT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYGATES - DAWN

- to the dazzling low morning sun

Then the concrete flank of the Southern Reach building as
the MASSIVE METAL GATES of the facility unlock

And swing open

Revealing the five women of the team

Each carrying their backpacks and automatic rifles

Ahead of them is the dusty scrubland of the deforested area
A few beats

Then DR VENTRESS starts walking

Behind the gates swing shut

EXT DEFORESTED AREA - DAWN

The team walk in single file

DR VENTRESS leads

Then THORENSEN then SHEPPARD then RADEK then LENA

They walk right past the BODY that THORENSEN pointed out

As they pass it LENA pauses

Sees the skull The way patches of hair and dried skin still
cling to the underside of the skull where it has been

shielded from the wind and sun

Sees the missing section of bone above the left eye socket
blown out by a bullet

Sees the curve of ribs visible where the material of the
uniform has started to disintegrate

Ahead DR VENTRESS has reached the treeline

DR VENTRESS stops before entering the forest Then turns to
look back at LENA

They lock eyes through the shimmering air
CUT TO BLACK

CAPTION

PART 2 - AREA X

curt TO -

EXT THE SKY - DAY

- the FULL MOON hanging in a clear blue daylight sky

The same image that distracted LENA as she taught her medical
students

curt TO -

EXT HOUSEGARDEN - DAY

- the garden of LENA’S house where LENA and KANE are
sunbathing on the lawn LENA in a bikini KANE in shorts

Around them are the remains of an impromptu picnic
They lie side by side looking up at the sky

LENA
I love seeing the moon in daytime
It’s like God made a mistake
leaving the hall lights on

KANE
Mmm - not sure about that God
doesn’t make mistakes

LENA
Oh really

KANE
Yeah It’s kind of key to the
whole being-a-God thing

LENA
I observe his mistakes every day

KANE
You know he’s listening right

LENA
If you take a cell and prevent the
incremental shortening of
telomeres you circumvent the
Hayflick division limit and prevent
the cell from entering senescence

KANE
Woah So weird you say that I
was about to make the exact same
point

LENA
Would you like me to explain what
it means

KANE
I would Because I find it
arousing when you patronise me

LENA
It means the cell doesn’t grow old
and die It becomes immortal

KANE
Don’t stop

LENA
We see the process of growing old
as somehow natural Whereas in
fact it’s fault in our genes We
inherited it but we don’t need it
or want it

(MORE)

LENA (CONTD)
And without the fault I would be
able to stay looking like this -

She illustrates the point by indicating herself

LENA (CONTD)
- forever

KANE glances at her bikini-clad form Then back at the sky

KANE
Okay Mistakes were made

Beats pass

LENA
SO are you going to tell me
where you’re heading this time

KANE
Nope
Beat
LENA
I know there’s something strange
about the mission
KANE
- Why
LENA
Because the silence around it is
even more deafening than usual
Beat
LENA (CONTD)
I don’t even get a clue
KANE sighs

KANE
Okay You get one clue We’1l be
under the same hemisphere So if
you step outside and look up
youll know we’re seeing the same
moon in the sky Day or night

LENA looks sideways at KANE

LENA
Holy shit

KANE
- What

LENA
Are you kidding me Is that what
you think I do when you’re away

KANE hesitates

KANE
I’m just saying -

LENA
- You think I come out into the
garden pining looking up at the
sky

LENA puts her hand on her chest Mimics herself
LENA (CONTD)
To think my darling Kane is looking
at this self-same Moon Oh my
distant celestial friend -
KANE laughs Shoves her sideways
LENA keeps going

LENA (CONTD)
- please care for my beloved

KANE grabs her Tries to stop her talking

LENA (CONTD)
- my brave soldier

KANE
Jesus - you know what you are
Youre disrespectful not just to
the men and women of the armed
forces -

LENA yelps as he starts tickling her

KANE (CONTD)
- but the also the President

LENA
(between gasps)
You forgot the flag

KANE
I was getting to the flag

LENA can no longer talk because he’s tickling her too hard

She becomes helpless with laughter as they rolling on the
grass

Eventually catching her breath back

LENA
Oh my hero

KANE
Screw you

LENA
Okay

They start kissing
With passion

CuT TO -

- the FULL MOON

Suspended in the blue Crater patterns only faintly visible
in daylight

Then -

- the MOON SHIMMERS

And then like a cell under a microscope -
- the MOON starts to DIVIDE

curt TO -

INT TENT - DAY

- LENA waking with a jolt

Wearing a T-shirt and underwear

Looking around Surrounded by BRIGHT ORANGE

Taking a moment to understand she is inside a tent

EXT FOREST CLEARINGCAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS

LENA unzips the front flap of her tent and climbs out -

- to discover a campsite Five small tents circled around a
burned out fire

The campsite is positioned in a grassy clearing deep inside
a forest The surrounding trees are Oak and Cyprus

Looking up the sun and clouds are seen through the familiar
mirage-like distortion - as if the Shimmer is like a dome
structure which we are now inside

Just in front of LENA THORENSEN and SHEPPARD sit surrounded
by packets of food
A little distance away RADEK is looking at a piece of
electronic equipment

DR VENTRESS is nowhere to be seen
LENA looks stunned

LENA
- What the Hell

THORENSEN and SHEPPARD look round

THORENSEN
Good You’re finally awake

LENA
Uh

LENA takes a moment
LENA (CONTD)

Sorry you’re going to have to give
me a moment I’ma little

thrown
SHEPPARD
Join the club
THORENSEN
You don’t remember setting up camp
right
LENA

- I don’t remember anything
after we reached the tree line

SHEPPARD
None of us do But check your
boots and pants They’ll be wet
and covered in mud And weve been
doing an inventory of the food
From the depletion in our stocks
weve been out here for at least
forty eight hours

LENA shakes her head

LENA
That’s not possible

RADEK walks over looking nervous

RADEK
Guys - you want to know what’s
weird

THORENSEN

I want to know what isn’t weird

RADEK pulls her short-wave radio from her belt
burst

It plays STATIC

RADEK
I’ve been checking all my radio and
electronic equipment None of it
is working properly Like I can
switch on the sat-phone and the
GPS and they boot up fine - but
there’s no signal Even though
weve probably got twenty
satellites above us right now -
nothing And check this out

Gives ita

RADEK holds up a magnetic COMPASS The needle is spinning

slowly

RADEK (CONTD)
It’s like we’re in the middle of
the most massive electromagnetic
interference

There is excitement in RADEK’S voice And a note of panic

RADEK (CONTD)
So we’ve got no compass no comms
no coordinates and no landmarks
We don’t know where we are or what
direction we should be heading

SHEPPARD
Radek - be cool We know we’re in
the state park So if we go South
we hit the ocean Once there we
can follow the shoreline until we
hit the perimeter wall

RADEK
But how do we know what’s South

SHEPPARD stands Pulls up her sleeve Shows her wrist

watch

SHEPPARD
Take your watch Point the hour
hand at the sun Split the
difference between the hour hand
and twelve

As she’s talking she’s doing

Having orientated the watch to the sun she points into the

forest

SHEPPARD (CONTD)
South

THORENSEN raises her eyebrows

THORENSEN
Get you Sheppard

SHEPPARD
Yeah Get me

DR VENTRESS
Very impressive

LENA looks around
DR VENTRESS is right behind her

She shows no sense of concern about the situation She seems
almost serene

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
And honestly Radek - we weren’t
really expecting the equipment to
work were we After thirteen
years of expeditions and thirteen
years of radio silence

She gestures at the tents
DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
Let’s pack up and get moving It’s

already gone ten o’clock We don’t
want to lose any more of the day

EXT SWAMP - DAY

The five women are walking in knee-deep water
It’s hot Heavy backpacks Heavy weapons Hard going
It’s also impossible to gauge the depth of the swamp

THORENSEN suddenly steps into a hole Sinks into the black
water up to her waist

THORENSEN
God damn it

LENA offers THORENSEN a hand Hauls her out
THORENSEN (CONTD)
Now I know why we all got amnesia
Why would you want to remember this
shit-hole
THORENSEN marches ahead soaked pissed off

LENA looks around

Sees the Cyprus trees with their fanned-out roots Spanish
moss on the branches dappled sunlight through the high
canopy All reflected in the glassy water

LENA turns to RADEK

LENA
Id like to remember it

RADEK
Sure It’s beautiful

They start walking again

LENA
So you’re a scientist too A
physicist right

RADEK
Astrophysicist Specifically the
life-cycle of stars

LENA
And what is the life-cycle of
stars
RADEK
Long
LENA laughs
LENA
I do the life-cycle of cells
Short
RADEK shrugs
RADEK

Still a cycle
UP AHEAD -
- SHEPPARD has seen something
A structure through the trees
SHEPPARD calls back to the others
SHEPPARD

Over here

EXT SWAMPFISHING HUT - DAY

On the bank of the swamp is the half-collapsed frame of a
wooden hut and a short jetty

The hut is smothered on one side by a dense carpet of
brightly coloured FLOWERS They cover the ground and push up
the side of the building like a snow drift

The five women approach it
THORENSEN
Think this place might show up on
the maps

SHEPPARD
Doubt it

SHEPPARD peers inside the door frame

The roof has partially fallen in Sunlight illuminates the
interior

There’s a bench and a table Some hooks on the walls

Everything metal is long corroded Everything wooden is
black and damp and patched with moss

SHEPPARD (CONTD)
I think it’s just a fishing hut

BACK OUTSIDE -

- LENA crouches by the brightly coloured flowers growing on
the side of the structure

Like a sprawling bouquet they are very varied Some large
Some small Some a vivid blue Some red Others are creamy
white with scatterings of orange-fringed crimson on the
broad petals

LENA
These are extremely strange
flowers
DR VENTRESS
Why

LENA
To look at them you wouldn’t say
they’re the same species

LENA pulls back an area of flowers to show the plant system
beneath

LENA (CONTD)
But they’re all growing from the
same branch structure So not just
the same species The same plant

RADEK
They’re like snowflakes Each one
is different I’ve never seen
anything like it

LENA
It seems stuck in a continuous
mutation Some kind of
morphogenesis error

DR VENTRESS
You mean it’s a pathology

LENA
It’s very pretty but you’d sure as
Hell call it a pathology if you saw
it in a human
LENA picks a white and crimson petal and holds it
DR VENTRESS
Amazing pattern Like a Rorschach
test
LENA offers it to her

LENA
So what do you see in there

RADEK has found something else

RADEK
Hey check this out

In the undergrowth behind the hut there are the hulls of two
upturned flat-bottomed fibreglass boats

She crouches down and get a hand under the lip of the hull
Lifts the fibreglass boat easily
RADEK (CONTD)

We could use these Be much

quicker way of getting across the

swamp
REVEAL —
- something that RADEK hasn’t seen

In the black swamp water behind RADEK there is the half-
submerged head of a huge ALLIGATOR

Its armoured skin is BLACK Obsidian Reflective

And it has strange eyes Red pupils that bleed into yellow
like diffusing saffron

Oblivious RADEK turns back to LENA and DR VENTRESS

RADEK (CONTD)
Shall we see if they still float

The NEXT MOMENT -

- the ALLIGATOR LUNGES at RADEK

Thrusting out of the water Massive jaws pulling open We
can see amidst the water spray and flash of movement this
creature is at least two times the size of a normal gator in

bulk as well as length

LENA
Radek

RADEK reacts -

- and sees the gaping MOUTH and TEETH as they lunge towards
her

She turns away -

- just as the creature’s jaws SNAP

Closing on her BACKPACK

RADEK’S screams are abruptly knocked out of her -

- as the ALLIGATOR viciously snaps its head to the side
tossing the young woman like a ragdoll

RADEK remains held fast by the shoulder straps on her bag
Then -

- the ALLIGATOR pulls back into the water and both the
creature and RADEK are gone

A moment of stunned silence
Then LENA is running for the water

LENA (CONTD)
RADEK

DR VENTRESS
Lena Stop

LENA doesn’t listen

Runs into the swamp up to her knees gun raised sweeping the
black mirrored surface

LENA
RADEK

THORENSEN and SHEPPARD appear from the hut

THORENSEN
What the Hell happened

LENA
A gator took her We’ve got to -

AT THAT MOMENT -

- RADEK bursts out of the water only a couple of metres from
LENA

Her backpack is gone She’s gasping for breath

RADEK
Help HELP ME

LENA grabs her
Starts dragging her out of the swamp

RADEK (CONTD)
It’s got my bag

LENA
Fuck the bag

Just as they reach the bank -

THORENSEN
Shit

- as the water erupts behind them as the GATOR appears and
lunges again

LENA shoves RADEK hard to the side and pulls her rifle to
her shoulder -

- and opens fire

She empties an ENTIRE clip into the GATOR Rounds slam into
torso punching through the reptile armour

But incredibly the creature isn’t killed

It simply redirects its attention from RADEK to LENA
LENA desperately tries to jam in a new clip -

- as the GATOR propels itself in her direction

Just as the creature is about to reach her -

- the CLIP is driven home and LENA cocks her gun and opens
fire again -

- emptying this magazine at point blank range directly down
the GATOR’S THROAT

The muzzle flash illuminates the interior Bullets slam into
the flesh

This time LENA is joined by SHEPPARD THORENSEN and DR
VENTRESS

In five seconds four women empty four magazines Riddling
the creature’s head and torso

After the last shot is fired the ALLIGATOR remains supported
on its legs jaws open frozen for a moment half out of the
water

Then the legs buckle

And the jaws shut

It’s dead

CUT TO BLACK

INT GATOR - DAY

IN DARKNESS we hear RADEK’S voice
Muffled
SHEPPARD (0S)
Be careful There might be a
reflex
THORENSEN (0S)
I think its reflex days are behind
it
SUDDEN DAYLIGHT -

- as we see the jaws being prized back open from the POV of
the gullet

We are inside the wet cave of the GATOR’S mouth looking out
over a slab of tongue and jagged stalagmitestalactite
teeth

LENA is peering in

Behind her we can see RADEK and DR VENTRESS

The jaw is being held open by SHEPPARD and THORENSEN

LENA
- Woah

LENA sticks her head even further inside
LENA (CONTD)
It’s the exactly same as the
flowers

We see what LENA sees

Behind the row of teeth there is a second row
folded backward slightly

And behind the second row there is third these

LENA (CONTD)
Look at the teeth Concentric
rows Something here is making big
waves in the gene pool

SHEPPARD
Sharks have teeth like that

DR VENTRESS
Could it be a cross-breed

LENA
You can’t cross-breed different
species They have different
genes
THORENSEN
(strained)
Hey - that’s all cool But can you
get your head the fuck out so we
can let this go It’s getting kind
of heavy
A final beat on LENA’S puzzled expression
Then LENA nods

LENA
Sure

LENA retracts her head
The jaw shuts with a wet thump
Back to BLACK

curt TO -

EXT SWAMP - DAY

- a tree in the swamp

Internal

almost flat

The trunk is clustered with fat mounds of moss flourishing

like petri-dish cultures
They have bright colours Not just greens but intense

and purples and rust colours
They look like disease

curt TO -

EXT SWAMP - DAY

- the flat-bottomed boats gliding over black water
Swampland floating by Serene

reds

The first boat holds DR VENTRESS RADEK and THORENSEN with

THORENSEN paddling

The second boat holds SHEPPARD and LENA

While SHEPPARD paddles LENA is preoccupied by a mark on her

forearm

It looks like a faint bruise

LENA pushes at it with her thumb Vaguely puzzled about

where she picked it up

SHEPPARD
You hurt Kerans

LENA
Just a bruise Guess I picked it
up with that gator

SHEPPARD
Likely

Beat

SHEPPARD (CONTD)
So where did you learn to shoot

LENA looks round Prepares to gets her internal story

straight

LENA
My husband was military We used
to go hunting together in
Pennsylvania Deer

SHEPPARD
Was military

LENA
Yeah

SHEPPARD

He quit

LENA
«e- No

LENA hesitates Doesn’t want to lie to SHEPPARD - but does

LENA (CONTD)
KIA

It’s almost the truth

SHEPPARD
I’m sorry to hear that

Beat

SHEPPARD (CONTD)
But I guess there had to be
something

LENA
What do you mean

SHEPPARD
Signing up for something like this -
it’s not something you do if your
life is in perfect harmony

SHEPPARD nods towards the other boat

SHEPPARD (CONTD)
We’re all damaged goods here
Thorensen is teetotal therefore an

sleeves because she doesn’t want
you to see the pale scars on her
forearms

LENA
Ventress

SHEPPARD
She’s like an office building ina
financial district All steel and
glass and height But what for

Beat

LENA
You

SHEPPARD pauses
SHEPPARD
I lost someone Like you But a

daughter Leukemia

Silence

LENA
Thorensen called this a suicide
mission

SHEPPARD
I doubt it’s as shrink-wrapped as
that

LENA

But on some level

SHEPPARD
You tell me Kerans When you
volunteered did you have high
expectations of making it back

LENA
I wasn’t thinking in those terms

LENA looks at SHEPPARD evenly
LENA (CONTD)
But now you mention it yes I’m
going to be making it back
SHEPPARD smiles

SHEPPARD
Babe I’m sticking with you

They lapse back into silence

Behind them SHEPPARD’S oar strokes leave a gentle
disturbance on the water

curt TO -

EXT SWAMP - DAY

- THORENSEN in the lead boat
Eyes narrowing

THORENSEN
We got something here

REVEAL —-
- the two boats gliding towards a shoreline

Behind which there is a cluster of low concrete buildings

EXT ABANDONED BASE - DAY

The five women walk into the collection of buildings

They have a distinctively military feel Prefab huts breeze
block walls chain-link fences guard huts by the gate

Nature has been busy reclaiming the area Tall grasses push
through cracks in the tarmac The concrete is stained with
rain and dark algae

And as with the trees in the swamp brightly-coloured mosses
bloom on the buildings

DR VENTRESS notices LENA’S gaze going to them

DR VENTRESS
More mutations

LENA
I saw many on the trees They’re
everywhere

DR VENTRESS
They look malignant don’t you
think Like tumours

LENA doesn’t answer
DR VENTRESS addresses the group
DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
At least now we know where we are
This was the previous Southern
Reach headquarters before the
Shimmer swallowed it

SHEPPARD pulls her map out Scans

SHEPPARD
Yes I’ve got it Right here

RADEK exhales

RADEK
Awesome We’re not lost any more

THORENSEN looks around

THORENSEN
And it’s nice timing A pretty
good place for us to stay the
night

DR VENTRESS
Agreed

She points to a low building up ahead
DR VENTRESS (CONTD)

That used to be the barracks
We’1l billet in there

INT ABANDONED BASEBARRACKS - DAY

The door to the barracks dormitory opens and the five women
enter

Light pushes through the grimy windows and the foliage that
has grown up outside

It illuminates rows of beds with bare mattresses
THORENSEN pulls off her bag and drops it on the nearest one

THORENSEN
I’ve slept in worse

SHEPPARD
Not sure I have

LENA takes a couple of steps further into the room She’s
seen something a couple of beds further into the barracks

There’s something lying on the ground
When she gets closer -
- she sees it’s someone’s BACKPACK

And she recognises what kind of someone Khaki Military
Spec ops

Beat
Then LENA turns to the others

LENA
Uh - guys Come and look at this

The others join her

RADEK
Whoa Someone else is here

LENA

Was here It’s covered in dust
THORENSEN

You think one of the other

missions

DR VENTRESS
Certainly could be No reason to
assume they weren’t able to reach
as far as us

SHEPPARD
Why would they leave their gear
here

THORENSEN
Guess they left in a hurry
LENA opens the bag Starts pulling stuff out
Produces a washbag
A scrunched-up rain poncho
Then -
- a VIDEO CAMERA

SHEPPARD
-- Hello

LENA glances back at the others

THORENSEN
What are you waiting for Do it

LENA pops open the flip screen
Presses the play button
And the camera is stone dead

LENA
Figures

RADEK
No problem Just take out the
memory card and we’ll stick it in
my camera

curt TO -

INT ABANDONED BASEBARRACKS - DAY

- the five women standing around RADEK’S camera waiting for
her to switch it on

RADEK clips shut the card hatch and powers the camera up

RADEK
There we go

curt TO -

INT SCREEN - CONTINUOUS

- extreme CLOSE UP on the tiny SCREEN of RADEK’S camera

The video starts

At first abstract Something dark and unfocused
accompanied by the kind of noise you hear when someone
accidentally dials their phone from their pocket
Then the image and noise suddenly resolve
And we find we are looking at KANE
And he’s looking at us
KANE
I don’t know how long we’ve been

here

curt TO -

INT ABANDONED BASEBARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

— LENA
Freezing at the sight of her husband
She shoots a glance at DR VENTRESS
DR VENTRESS doesn’t look back
KANE (0S)
It must at least be weeks But it

could also be months or years

CUT BACK TO -

INT SCREEN - CONTINUOUS

— KANE

We see he is sitting on steps in sunlight Somewhere in the
abandoned base

Red eyes unshaven Wired As if he hasn’t slept in days

He’s looking just past the lens - addressing not the camera
but the CAMERAMAN

KANE
We’ve lost track Of time and
everything else

Beat
KANE (CONTD)
Sometimes I think I must be
dreaming But I know I can’t be
Because I never wake up

Beat
KANE (CONTD)
If anything it’s the other life
that feels most like a dream The
wife The home They don’t seem
to -
KANE breaks off Glances over his shoulder

KANE (CONTD)
You hear that

CAMERAMAN
I heard it

A beat later there is a distant crackle of automatic
gunfire

KANE looks back at the CAMERAMAN

KANE
They’re coming back

KANE stands abruptly Out of frame

KANE (CONTD)
Get to positions

The video jerks sideways as the CAMERAMAN moves
Then CUTS STRAIGHT TO -
- an INTENSE night-time FIRE-FIGHT

KANE and two others soldier - PEYTON and SHELLY - are
crouched behind a LOW WALL somewhere in the compound

They take turns to fire over the top of the wall Faces
by muzzle flashes

KANE (CONTD)
Reloading

PEYTON takes over from KANE
Firing at something in the darkness
PEYTON turns to the CAMERAMAN and shouts
PEYTON
You seeing that You getting it on

film You got to get it

curt TO -

INT ABANDONED BASEBARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

- DR VENTRESS

lit

DR VENTRESS
Freeze it there

RADEK hits pause
REVEAL the image on the screen

The picture is blurred smeared by the fast left-right pan of
the CAMERAMAN But it seems to depict a SHIRTLESS MAN
running at the lens no more than five or six metres away
burned-out by a blasting strobe of MUZZLE FLASH

There’s something strange about the MAN’S form

His neck is twisted pushing his head sideways into an
unnatural position It feels wrong Broken

Where his jaw should be there is a cavity as if his mouth
has swallowed the lower part of his face

It’s unclear - his jaw may have been shot off His neck may
actually be broken

But his arms also have a strange broken quality It’s
subtle but the break point of the elbow is slightly higher
than it should be The upper arm too short the forearm too
long The deformation is oddly animal-like

And again as with the neck and jaw ambiguous Are we
seeing what is there or a distortion caused by the lighting
and the smeared freeze-frame
BURNED OVER THIS IMAGE is a bright red streak It is the RED
DOT LASER SIGHT of KANE’S gun carved across the frame like
the tail-light of a car burned onto a retina
The aim is about to settle on the MAN’S torso
SILENCE as the five women absorb what they are seeing
Broken by THORENSEN

THORENSEN

- Whoa What the Hell happened
to that guy

SHEPPARD
Has his jaw been shot off

THORENSEN
I don’t know Injuries do freaky
stuff to people but

The sentence trails

DR VENTRESS
Press play again

curt TO -

INT SCREEN - CONTINUOUS

- the film restarting

A split second later KANE is firing Bullets hit the RED
DOT And the DEFORMED MAN drops

The video CUTS again

This time to the violent sway-motion of the CAMERAMAN
running

The video CUTS again

Now the CAMERAMAN is crouched beside KANE who is by the
corner of a building who is hunched over as incoming rounds
hit the concrete

The firing is sustained -

- then stops

Immediately KANE swings out and RETURNS FIRE

From somewhere nearby over the noise of the firing we hear
screaming

Then PEYTON shouting

PEYTON (0S)
Cease fire Cease fire

The video CUTS again
This time the CAMERAMAN is following SHELLEY
Now we’re in an interior

Which we recognise as the video aperture corrects for the
light -

- as the BARRACKS

curt TO -

INT ABANDONED BASEBARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

- RADEK wide-eyed - realising

RADEK
Oh shit - shit - that’s here
They’re walking right down this
room
DR VENTRESS
Radek be quiet

CUT BACK TO -

INT SCREEN - CONTINUOUS

- SHELLEY and the CAMERAMAN walking the length of the
barracks

Then into the SHOWER ROOM at the far end
There they find KANE and PEYTON

Standing beside another man His name is MAYER And
handcuffed to one of the water pipes

KANE and PEYTON are arguing Raised voices
KANE
What the Hell do you want me do
Peyton Actually cut him open and
take a look

PEYTON
We got to Kane

MAYER starts pleading

MAYER
No - no you don’t You don’t have
to

PEYTON
We got to

MAYER

Kane please

KANE
You mean I’ve got to

MAYER
Jesus - Jesus Christ - Kane

KANE
God damn it

KANE reaches to his belt
Pulls a long fixed-blade knife

KANE (CONT’D)
I’m sorry

MAYER starts screaming

he’s

MAYER
Jesus - I swear to God - theres
nothing wrong with me Theres
nothing wrong
KANE’S head snaps around to the CAMERAMAN

KANE
You aren’t filming this

MAYER
(screams )
KANE DONT -

The image dies

curt TO -

INT ABANDONED BASEBARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

- the five women
Looking at the black screen

LENA is in a place beyond horror - mind assailed not able to
process what has just happened

SHEPPARD breaks the spell by leaning forward and switching
the screen off

RADEK
»- Oh God

THORENSEN
You know them right

For a moment LENA thinks THORENSEN is talking to her
Then sees THORENSEN is directing the question at DR VENTRESS
THORENSEN (CONTD)
It’s the team that went in the year

before us The spec ops guys

DR VENTRESS

Yes

SHEPPARD
Including the one tied to the
chair

DR VENTRESS
His name was Mayer

Beat

Then THORENSEN starts walking

In the same direction we saw SHELLEY walk Down the length
of the BARRACKS to the showers
After a few moments the others go after her -
- except LENA
Halfway down the barracks DR VENTRESS stops
Looks back at LENA
A beat between them

Then LENA follows

INT ABANDONED BASEBARRACKSSHOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

LENA enters

To find RADEK SHEPPARD THORENSEN and DR VENTRESS

In front of them is MAYER’S body Still cuffed to the chair
Desiccated skeletal

His ribs have been broken open at the sternum and are
splayed open like a book Like inverted wings

And his skull is sitting on the ground Laid in front of his
feet

Silence
RADEK
--- I don’t want to stay here
tonight

No one says anything

RADEK (CONTD)
I dont want to stay here tonight

DR VENTRESS
I don’t think we have a choice
It’s late in the day for us to move

on

RADEK
Please -

SHEPPARD
Hey

SHEPPARD puts a hand on RADEK’S face Gently redirecting the
younger woman’s gaze away from the corpse

SHEPPARD (CONTD)
We won’t have to stay in the
barracks We can choose another
building And we’ll figure out a
guard rota

LENA looks down at MAYER’S open rib cage The skull and
dislocated jaw

THORENSEN
Right

curt TO -

EXT HOUSEBEDROOM - NIGHT

- LENA’S face

Asleep In darkness

Then LIGHT flooding on to her closed eyes
Stirring her

IN THE FOREGROUND -

- a glass of ORANGE JUICE is laid down On to a bedside
table

LENA blinks herself awake
- to see her bedroom

And KANE drawing the curtains
Then turning to her

KANE
Freshly squeezed

LENA
That’s a surprise

KANE
I’m full of surprises

He sits on the bed next to her
KANE (CONTD)
But not all of them good I’m

leaving a day early

LENA
You mean today

KANE
I mean now

Beat

LENA
- Shit

LENA props herself up
LENA (CONTD)
I had a whole day planned We were
going to go to Sam and Mary’s for
lunch and then drive out to -
KANE
(cuts in)
- I’m sorry We can’t

LENA reaches out with her hand Takes his

LENA
Well can we at least -

He pulls his hand back

LENA (CONTD)
‘Now’ means ‘right now’

KANE
Yeah

A beat

LENA picks up on something in KANE A detachment A subtle
coldness

LENA
What is it

KANE doesn’t answer for a moment
Then he looks at her

KANE
I love you Lena

LENA frowns

LENA
-- I love you too

On KANE
Gazing back at her flatly
Giving nothing back Unreachable

curt TO -

INT ABANDONED BASEREC ROOM - NIGHT

- LENA’S eyes flicking open

Echoing the image of her waking that we just saw But this
time when she rubs the sleep out of her eyes she’s in the
Shimmer

REVEAL what was once the REC ROOM of the abandoned base
There’s a dart board on the wall and a pool table with mould-
covered baize and a pinball machine with broken glass

She’s got a sheen of sweat on her face Wipes it off

Looks around

On the floor she sees THORENSEN asleep on her unrolled
bedding

Beside THORENSEN is RADEK also asleep
Beside RADEK is SHEPPARD

Awake

SHEPPARD winks

LENA
Hey

The two women whisper quietly to each other

SHEPPARD
How you doing babe

LENA
Fine

LENA nods at RADEK

LENA (CONTD)
Good she’s getting some rest

SHEPPARD
Yeah - with the help of a little
sedative

LENA

How about you Get any sleep
SHEPPARD shakes her head
SHEPPARD
Id need a horse-trang to knock me
out I’m at least as freaked as
Radek Just hiding it better

Beat

LENA

I’1l go check on Dr Ventress
SHEPPARD

You got it

EXT ABANDONED BASEREC ROOM HUT - NIGHT

LENA exits the REC ROOM hut

The hut is on the edge of the abandoned facility The
starlight doesn’t illuminate much but we can just about make
out the chain-link perimeter fence and beyond it the black
shape of the forest

DR VENTRESS is sitting at a picnic table just outside the
door studying a map by torchlight

DR VENTRESS
What are you doing up Kerans
You’re not due to relieve me until
three AM

LENA
I’m done sleeping for the night

DR VENTRESS
In that case you might as well
take a look at this

DR VENTRESS taps way-point positions on the map

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
Here’s us Here’s where I think we
camped last night And here’s the
lighthouse Judging by the
distance we covered today we won’t
reach it tomorrow But look South
West from here -

DR VENTRESS indicates a new position
DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
- Ville Perdu A tiny community
evacuated ten years ago I think
we should aim there for tomorrow
night Then pick up the road to
the coast
LENA says nothing
DR VENTRESS notices the non-response
She looks up at LENA from the map and the torchlight

A beat between them
Then LENA speaks

LENA
The previous expeditions Were
they selected in the same way as
this one From volunteers

DR VENTRESS
Yes They were

LENA
Even the soldiers

DR VENTRESS
-- No one was ordered to go

LENA meets the doctor’s gaze

LENA
Then I have to ask why did my
husband volunteer for a suicide
mission

DR VENTRESS pauses

Beat

LENA reacts

DR VENTRESS
Why would I have an answer to that
question

LENA
Because you ran the programme You
must have assessed him And he
must have told you

DR VENTRESS
So you’re asking me as a
psychologist

LENA
Yes

DR VENTRESS
Then as a psychologist I think
youre confusing suicide with self-
destruction and they’re very
different Almost none of us
commit suicide whereas almost all
of us self-destruct Somehow In
some part of our lives We drink
or take drugs or destabilise the
happy job -

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
- or happy marriage

Uncertain whether this was targeted at her
DR VENTRESS continues
DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
But these aren’t decisions
They’re impulses And in fact as
a biologist you’re better placed
to explain them than me

LENA
What do you mean

DR VENTRESS
Isn’t the self-destruction coded
into us Imprinted into each cell
Silence

DR VENTRESS shrugs

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
So

The word hangs

And LENA is spared having to find a reply -

- by a strange noise from somewhere in the darkness
A POPPING

A TEARING

Not organic Metallic Surprisingly loud

The heads of the women flick round to the source of the
noise

LENA
- What was that

DR VENTRESS
I don’t know

LENA unslings her rifles and raises it switching on the
night-vision scope

CuT TO -
- the green-white view
Scanning the tree line through the fence

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
You see anything

LENA
No just -

LENA breaks off

LENA (CONT’D)
Yes

Through the scope there is something
A large hole in the perimeter fence
The chain-link twisted pulled open
CuT TO -

- SHEPPARD emerges from the REC ROOM HUT into the
holding her weapon and a flashlight

SHEPPARD
What’s going on I heard a noise

LENA
Something’s just come through the
fence
DR VENTRESS
What do you mean through the
fence
LENA dips the gun

LENA
It’s ripped open like a zipper

SHEPPARD
But what could do that

LENA
I don’t know Something big

ANOTHER NOISE

And this is organic It’s a thump of movement
Then a panting breath A snort

And it feels very close

The three women freeze

A beat

Then SHEPPARD lifts her FLASHLIGHT

Points it straight in front of her

And illuminates a huge creature

- less than two metres away

moonlight

It looks something like a BLACK BEAR But like the GATOR
it’s twice the size it should be
And it’s stranger than the GATOR It seems to be enmeshed
with plant matter Stems and leaves are growing out of its
fur Its fur hangs like the Spanish moss on the swamp oak
branches Long thorns push outwards bristling over the

crown of its skull along its snout down its arms

And it’s up on its hind legs Standing like a man towering
over SHEPPARD and LENA Blotting out the stars

Then it opens its jaws And it looks as if some of the plant
matter is actually growing from inside the BEAR’S mouth

It is a terrifying and transfixing sight

SHEPPARD
shit

The next moment - with shocking speed - the BEAR lunges
downwards -

- at SHEPPARD

There is a glimpse of her being pulled to the side and
almost COMPRESSED Like a glimpse of someone being hit by a
car

Then the FLASHLIGHT winks out

And SHEPPARD is gone

Sucked into a rush of movement and blackness

LENA who has hardly had time to draw breath now reacts

LENA
Sheppard

No answer

LENA clamps the night scope to her eye scanning desperately
SEES something massive in the darkness moving fast back
towards the fence A glimpse of SHEPPARD dragged like a rag
doll

Then it’s gone The creature and SHEPPARD have vanished

LENA (CONTD)
SHEPPARD

THORENSEN appears holding her gun

THORENSEN
What’s going on Where is she

LENA
She’s gone She was right here
next to me - and something took
her It was like a bear or -
Sudden screaming
High desperate And sustained

It’s SHEPPARD But she’s nowhere close It’s from the
trees

THORENSEN
Oh Christ

LENA THORENSEN and DR VENTRESS start running toward the
sound

They reach the break in the fence

But the forest beyond is immeasurably massive and dark and
the screams are from deep inside

LENA calls out -

LENA
SHEPPARD

SHEPPARDS shrieking continues
Then -

- abruptly stops

EXT THE SHIMMER - DAY

Daybreak through the SHIMMER

EXT ABANDONED BASEREC ROOM - DAY

RADEK is sat on the ground Shaking uncontrollably

DR VENTRESS sits on a chair on the far side of the room
observing RADEK with a neutral expression

LENA and THORENSEN are standing
RADEK
We have to go back We have to go

back now

THORENSEN
She’s right

DR VENTRESS
Right in what sense
THORENSEN
We’ve been attacked twice we’ve
lost one of the team and we have
documentary evidence that the
previous team were also under
attack - not just by mutated
creatures but each other How
more ‘right’ could she be

DR VENTRESS
We haven’t reached the lighthouse
We still don’t understand the cause
or nature of the Shimmer

THORENSEN
But we have data observations
photographs samples -

DR VENTRESS
- all of which make the phenomenon
less explicable not more

THORENSEN
That’s beside the point Our
mission parameters are to get into
Area X find something out and
live to tell the story

DR VENTRESS
Mission parameters

DR VENTRESS stands

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
I’m not sure I have any mission
parameters

THORENSEN shoots a glance at LENA

THORENSEN
- What the Hell

DR VENTRESS
I plan to get to the lighthouse
But I’m not going to pretend it’s
for a mission It’s because I want
to know what’s inside

DR VENTRESS walks to the door
DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
I’1l do it alone if need be You
simply decide whether you’re coming
with me or not

DR VENTRESS exits

Leaving LENA THORENSEN and RADEK alone
Silence

THORENSEN
- She’s crazy

Then THORENSEN turns to LENA

THORENSEN (CONT’D)
Thanks for the back-up Kerans

LENA
- I didn’t know there were sides

THORENSEN
There are sides

LENA hesitates

LENA
Okay Then I agree with you We
should be heading back

THORENSEN looks relieved

Beat

THORENSEN
Right Good The three of us can -

LENA
(interrupts)
Just a minute

THORENSEN already doesn’t like this

LENA (CONTD)
We head back yes But I don’t
think we do it by retracing the
route we took here It took us
approximately four days to reach
this point right But the coast
is only two days away And as
Sheppard pointed out once we hit
the shore we can follow it until
we hit the perimeter wall It’s
impossible to get lost and it will
be easier terrain than making our
way back through the swamps

THORENSEN
Youre saying we get out by going
deeper in

LENA
- If you like yes

THORENSEN
If I ‘like’ No Kerans I don’t
fucking ‘like’

THORENSEN doesn’t disguise her suspicion

THORENSEN (CONTD)
This isn’t just a way of talking us
round so we keep heading for the
lighthouse

LENA
It has nothing to do with the
lighthouse I believe the coast is
the best route out That’s all
Silence

THORENSEN glances at RADEK

The younger woman has closed her eyes Just trying to block
it all out

THORENSEN

(under her breath)
Shit

EXT ABANDONED BASEREC ROOM HUT - DAY

LENA exits the hut Wearing her backpack Carrying her gun

DR VENTRESS stands in the spot where SHEPPARD was attacked
gazing towards the broken fence

LENA approaches

LENA
We’re coming with you

DR VENTRESS glances back at LENA

DR VENTRESS
I knew you would be But I’m glad
about the others Better we stick
together

DR VENTRESS shoulders her backpack

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
Incidentally Lena I just wanted
to say on top of whatever else is
going here you shouldn’t worry

LENA
- Worry about what

DR VENTRESS
Your secret It’s safe with me

LENA pauses
LENA
‘My secret’ You’re talking about
my husband
LENA lowers her voice
LENA (CONTD)
Is that not our secret In that
you were the one who instructed me
to keep it
DR VENTRESS shrugs
DR VENTRESS
By all means If that way of
seeing it is helpful to you
THORENSEN and RADEK appear at the door to the REC ROOM HUT
DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
(calls)

Are we good to go

THORENSEN makes no reply

EXT SWAMP - DAY

The four-person team walk in single file

DR VENTRESS on point Then RADEK Then THORENSEN Then
LENA

As they walk LENA becomes aware that THORENSEN is talking to
herself

Low muttering Unintelligible It sounds like some kind of
internal private argument unwittingly externalised

LENA watches

LENA
Hey Thorensen

THORENSEN’S gaze flicks round
There’s a flash of something in her eyes

Something like anger Something like a lack of recognition
As if whatever she’s seeing at that moment it isn’t LENA

Then it’s gone

THORENSEN
What

LENA
You okay

THORENSEN turns away

THORENSEN
I’m fine Leave me alone

CuT TO -

-— DR VENTRESS

Suddenly stopping

She’s seen something just ahead

Then RADEK sees it too Puts a hand over her mouth
As LENA reaches them REVEAL -

- crushed undergrowth forming a trail into the trees

And along it unmistakable splashes and smears of blood on
the leaves

RADEK
Sheppard

DR VENTRESS
Very likely

LENA
She might still be alive

DR VENTRESS
I think it’s unlikely

LENA
I think we need to know

Beat

DR VENTRESS
I’m not risking the entire mission

LENA
Fine

LENA cocks her rifle

THORENSEN
I’1l come with you Kerans

LENA glances at THORENSEN

Again sees something in her eyes A slight sheen or glaze
Something not quite right
LENA
I’1ll go alone Quicker quieter

EXT SWAMP - DAY

LENA heads through the swamp

Gun raised Following the blood trail

From somewhere nearby she hears a noise

Perhaps the BEAR Perhaps something else

She freezes

Looks into the trees

There is movement in the foliage Something could be out

there - a creature or person Or equally it could be a
trick of the light and shadows

LENA watches Waits
Sees something

But it’s not the BEAR
It’s a DEER

Or a deer-like creature

Elongated legs Branch and leaf structures flowing out of
its back

Then - skittish - it’s gone

Sweat runs down LENA’S face She blinks it out of her eyes

Silence returns

LENA heads on

EXT SWAMPCLEARING - DAY

Dense foliage

In it we find LENA

Crawling forwards on her belly
She’s seen something up ahead

REVEAL —

- the end of the blood trail in a clearing

In the middle of the clearing sunlit is SHEPPARD Lying on
her back facing upwards Clothes soaked with blood

LENA watches
Waits

No sound except wind in trees

INT SWAMPCLEARING - DAY

LENA cautiously approaches SHEPPARDS body gun raised
continually scanning the tree line

As she reach her colleague -

— REVEAL SHEPPARD

Her midriff is torn Either bitten or clawed Through the
dark congealed blood and ripped material we glimpse the blue-
white coil of intestine

But her face is intact

There are flecks of blood on her cheek

And her eyes are open

Then -

- something very strange happens

Her LEFT EYE - and her left eye only - makes a sudden
jittering movement Like a quiver

LENA jumps

LENA
Jesus

Then SHEPPARDS slightly parted lips move As if just
starting to form a word

LENA (CONTD)
Sheppard

CUT BACK to SHEPPARDS face -

- as SHEPPARDS mouth is pushed more fully open which
reveals that INSIDE her mouth there is a creature

The size of small snake The texture and colour of worm

SHEPPARDS cheeks undulate gently with the movement

And the LEFT EYE suddenly starts to sink into the socket as
if being consumed

curt TO -

EXT SWAMP - DAY

- LENA returning to where DR VENTRESS THORENSEN and RADEK
are waiting

RADEK
Did you find her

LENA
She’s dead

The finality in LENA’S voice dissuades follow-up questions

Wordlessly RADEK THORENSEN and DR VENTRESS shoulder their
backpacks

EXT SWAMP - DAY

Distant from the small group
They are far figures moving through the green
Flitting in and out of view

Then merged totally Gone

EXT THE SUN - SUNDOWN

The light of the setting sun refracting into a rainbow

EXT OUTSIDE VILLE PERDU - SUNDOWN

The four women stand on a dirt road

Ahead is a small town A backwater place The twenty or so
buildings are largely wooden and single-storey

Plant-life has been busy reclaiming the structures

The moss tumour-growths are even more extreme here Some of
the buildings are half-swallowed by the red and green
clusters

DR VENTRESS
This is where we camp tonight The
ocean is another two hours hike
from here We pick a house
Secure the windows and doors And
we don’t venture out until sun-up

EXT VILLE PERDU - SUNDOWN

The women enter the town
Not talking
Scanning Alert

Weapons unslung and hands resting with the finger above the
trigger guard

LENA is distracted by the sight of one of the houses - from
which a tree has appeared to grow from the inside Branches
push out through the windows and roof shingles

RADEK
Kerans

The quiet urgency in RADEK’S voice makes everyone look round
RADEK is frozen to the spot

LENA follows her gaze -

- and jolts

Twenty or so metres ahead in the dark space between two of
the buildings there is what appears to be the silhouette of
a MAN

Motionless Arms at his side Facing them

Only after registering the shape of the MAN does it become
clear that there is something odd about him

He’s slightly misshapen His arms and torso are too thin
His legs are too thick

A beat
No one has moved
LENA takes a step towards the MAN Raises a hand

LENA
Hello

The silhouette of the MAN doesn’t react at all
LENA takes another step -
- and the shift in perspective reveals another figure

This one is behind the man behind the building Not in
shadow but caught in the light from the dropping sun

It looks like a CHILD

Also motionless also misshapen

But now in the light the oddness of the shape makes more
sense

The CHILD is not flesh and blood but plant A twisting root
system form calves and feet leading up to knotted branches
and densely packed leaves

Like a topiary

EXT VILLE PERDUSTATUE GARDEN - SUNDOWN

LENA followed by the others walks through the space between
the buildings past the shape of the MAN -

- into something that is like a statue garden

In the space between the back of the houses and the tree-line
of the forest there are twenty or so plant figures

Some of them have grown into reasonable facsimiles of a man
or woman or a child

Others are incomplete The legs and half the torso An
outstretched arm becoming a tangle of twigs and leaves
beyond the bicep

Others have exploded far beyond the basic outline of a human
expanding out into tree structures

THORENSEN
What are these things Were they
made by the people who lived here
DR VENTRESS
Impossible The area has been
empty for years

THORENSEN
Or made by one previous teams

LENA examines a CHILD PLANT

LENA
They haven’t been cut this way

LENA plucks a LEAF from the CHILD FIGURE

LENA (CONTD)
They’ve grown this way

THORENSEN
What are you talking about That
makes no sense

RADEK speaks quietly
RADEK
I think it does

RADEK has sat on the grass between two of the figures

RADEK (CONTD)
In fact it makes total sense

All turn to RADEK

RADEK (CONTD)
I’d thought the radio waves were
blocked by the Shimmer and that’s
why no one inside could communicate
with base or GPS

RADEK glances upwards
RADEK (CONTD)
But I look up I see the sun And
the sky The light waves aren’t
blocked

Bright rainbow colours fringe the clouds above

RADEK (CONTD)
They’re refracted

RADEK reaches for her short-wave radio hooked on her belt

and switches it on

RADEK (CONTD)
And it’s the same with the radios
The signals aren’t gone

Through the STATIC FUZZ there are sounds Pulses
distorted tones that rise and fall

RADEK (CONTD)
- They’re split Scrambled

RADEK switches the radio off
Shifts her gaze to LENA

RADEK (CONTD)
The leaf in your hand You know
what you’d find if you sequenced
it Hox Pax 6

DR VENTRESS
Hox What are you talking about

LENA
They’re the genes that define body
structure But in animals Not
plants

Soft

RADEK
The plants have arms The arms are
attached to shoulders The legs
are attached to hips

LENA is trying to collect her thoughts mind racing

LENA
No - they’re just simulacra Like
a stick insect or chameleon What
youre saying is simply not
possible

RADEK
None of this is possible Lena
But it’s what’s happening The
Shimmer is a prism It refracts
everything Light waves fields
DNA

RADEK hesitates

RADEK (CONTD)
All DNA

THORENSEN interrupts overwhelmed by confusion and
frustration

THORENSEN
Stop Just - stop talking science
Speak English What do you mean
‘All DNA’

LENA
You know what she means Thorensen
She means our DNA

LENA lets the leaf drop
LENA (CONTD)
Whatever’s happening to everything

else will also be happening to us

In the low sun everything upright is silhouette fringed
with gold

On the ground the long shadows of the women and the plant

statues are fringed with chromatic aberration and are
indistinguishable from each other

INT VILLE PERDUHOUSE - NIGHT

The women are inside the FRONT ROOM of one of the abandoned
houses

The KITCHEN is off the front room

The kitchen and living room windows have been barricaded and
LENA and THORENSEN are positioning a heavy dresser to jam the
front door

Once it’s in place LENA turns to the others
LENA

You all get some sleep I’m
keeping first watch

EXT THE MOON - NIGHT

The moon in the sky through the Shimmer

INT VILLE PERDUHOUSEFRONT ROOM - NIGHT

LENA sits at the dining table The room is lit by her
upended flashlight She’s removed the top exposing the
bulb like a candle

She’s watching the other three

Laid out on their bedding Their soft breathing
Satisfying herself that they’re all asleep

Then she quietly opens her backpack

Removes a small case Inside is the equipment we saw her
select from the Southern Reach laboratory

A field microscope A scalpel

She removes a blade from a sealed foil packet
Clips a blade into the scalpel

Then she rolls up her left shirt sleeve

It reveals her forearm -

- and the unexplained BRUISE she first noticed while talking
to SHEPPARD as they paddled through the swamp

The mark is now darker And larger Roughly circular with
a slight indication of a pattern It’s as the bruise were
painted with ink on wet paper and the marks have blurred
into something too abstract to understand

LENA gazes at the strange oddly malign shape

Then pushes the scalpel into it Drawing blood from the dark
marks

A beat

The sight of the crimson bead has hypnotised her

curt TO -

INT VILLE PERDUHOUSE - NIGHT

- LENA leaning over her microscope
CuT TO -

- extreme CLOSE UP on blood cells The biconcave shape are
clearly visible

The MAGNIFICATION increases We see inside the translucent
cell structure

Where something is shimmering

curt TO -

- LENA leaning away from the microscope

Blank-faced

Then she stands walks past the apparently sleeping figures

of RADEK THORENSEN and DR VENTRESS

INT VILLE PERDUHOUSEKITCHEN - NIGHT

LENA enters the KITCHEN

Goes directly to the sink

And - quietly with a minimum of fuss - throws up
When she has finished she turns around -

- and sees RADEK Standing at the kitchen door Looking at
her

RADEK
Well

LENA
Your thesis is correct

RADEK
What did you see

LENA
It’s in me

RADEK
It’ll be in all of us
LENA
I imagine so

RADEK exhales
Beat

RADEK
Do you think you can get any sleep

LENA doesn’t answer

RADEK (CONTD)
You should try

curt TO -

EXT SKY - DAY
- CLOSE UP on the MOON in daylight

curt TO -

INT JOHNS HOPKINS MEDICAL SCHOOLSEMINAR ROOM - DAY

- LENA talking to her students

LENA
So we can describe cancer as a
genetic mutation that causes
unregulated cell growth But
genetic mutation is also the reason
we exist We wouldn’t have evolved
from the single-cell organism from
which we’re all derived

LENA pauses
LENA (CONTD)
I think it’s partly why cancer
frightens us It doesn’t just hurt
us and kill us It changes us

curt TO -

EXT VILLE PERDUSTATUE GARDEN - NIGHT

- the moonlit human shapes in the statue garden
Not quite motionless Moving gently in wind

curt TO -

INT HOUSEBEDROOM - NIGHT

- LENA’S face moonlit
Seen over a man’s shoulder
In bed Having sex

curt TO -

INT HOUSEBEDROOM - NIGHT

— LENA

Now sitting at her bedroom window Gazing out at the night
sky over the suburban street

REVEAL the man on the bed behind her
It isn’t KANE

It’s her work colleague DANIEL
Beats pass

Then LENA speaks

LENA
This was a mistake

DANIEL
Okay

He pauses

DANIEL (CONTD)
- But it’s a mistake we keep
making It’s not exactly the first
time I’ve been in your bed or you
in mine Whenever he goes away we
find ourselves right here

LENA
It’s still a mistake

DANIEL half-laughs

DANIEL
You want to have this conversation
again

Silence

DANIEL (CONTD)
Fine Let’s have it again You
spend more time away from your
husband than with him

(MORE )

DANIEL (CONT’D)
You can’t talk to him about your
work and he won’t talk to you
about his And there is a clear
physical and intellectual
connection between us Have I
covered the bases

LENA
You didn’t mention your wife

DANIEL
I love my wife as I always make
plain She’s blameless in this

DANIEL sits up in bed

DANIEL (CONTD)
Come on Lena What’s really going
on here
LENA doesn’t answer She’s zoned him out
DANIEL (CONTD)
Is it because you haven’t heard
from him You think
DANIEL hesitates
DANIEL (CONTD)
- You think something may have
happened to him
Beat
DANIEL (CONTD)
Or you think he knows That’s it
isn’t it You think somehow he’s
found out about our affair
The note of anxiety in DANIEL’S voice pulls LENA out of her
glaze He’s clearly more worried by the idea that KANE knows
about their affair than KANE being KIA

DANIEL (CONT’D)
-- Has he found out

LENA glances back at DANIEL
Watches him for a moment
Flat Dead

LENA
You should go

DANIEL frowns

DANIEL
Look Lena I -

LENA
Dan

DANIEL cuts himself off
LENA (CONTD)
I’m not interested in talking to
you or anything you have to say
Just get dressed and get out will
you
A beat
Then DANIEL stands
Starts to put on his clothes
DANIEL
You know it’s not me you hate

It’s yourself

LENA
No Dan It’s you too

LENA turns away back to the window
CLOSE ON LENA’S FACE
LENA (CONTD)

This is never going to happen

again
She shuts her eyes
Behind her out of sight we hear DANIEL leave
Then -

- we hear THORENSEN’S voice

THORENSEN (0S)
You lying bitch

The voice intrudes in the way an alarm clock intrudes on a
dream The sudden awareness that the alarm is real and the
dream is not

curt TO -

INT VILLE PERDUHOUSEFRONT ROOM - NIGHT

- LENA opening her eyes

Sees THORENSEN and RADEK

DR VENTRESS is nowhere to be seen
RADEK looks terrified

And THORENSEN is leaning over LENA Eyes wide lips curled
back over teeth

Holding her automatic rifle Pointed at LENA’S head
LENA startles - waking fast Sitting upright

LENA
What’s going on

THORENSEN
You don’t get to ask that question
You get to answer it
RADEK tosses something
It lands on LENA’S lap
LENA looks down -

- and sees KANE’S face looking at her out of her open SILVER
LOCKET

LENA’S blood freezes
She looks up -

- just in time to see THORENSEN spin her rifle around and
smashes the stock down Knocking LENA out cold

CUT TO BLACK

Then CUT TO -

INT VILLE PERDUHOUSEFRONT ROOM - NIGHT

- the view-finder POV of a CAMERA as it POWERS UP

The camera is being handheld by RADEK and is filming LENA
and DR VENTRESS -

- who are both tied to kitchen chairs Wrists bound behind
their backs Ankles tied to the chair legs

Blood has run down LENA’S face from a cut inside her hair-
line

DR VENTRESS is bruised under the eye

THORENSEN stands in front of them holding her gun

DR VENTRESS
Thorensen -
THORENSEN’S gun swings immediately to DR VENTRESS

THORENSEN
(cuts in)
Shut up

The gun swings back to LENA

THORENSEN (CONTD)
Keep talking Kerans

CUT OUT from RADEK’S camera POV The rest of the scene
intercuts the camera footage with normal photography

LENA
But Thorensen I’m telling you -
that’s all there is to it He’s my
husband He was on the previous
mission He went in came out and
was sick and I needed to
understand what had happened to
him I thought maybe if I knew
what had damaged him I could -

THORENSEN
(cuts in)
Bullshit You think I don’t know
this whole thing’s a set-up You
two - you’ve been working together
You tricked us You lied to us
You led us here

THORENSEN’S gun swings back DR VENTRESS

THORENSEN (CONTD)
Tell me I’m wrong

DR VENTRESS
You’re wrong But you’re also not
interested hearing in the truth

DR VENTRESS looks at THORENSEN Hard Unfazed

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
Or not able

THORENSEN
What do you mean by that

DR VENTRESS
Isnt it obvious

DR VENTRESS looks to the VIDEO CAMERA - to RADEK

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
Tell me Radek If the Shimmer is
refracting us physically couldnt
it refract us psychologically too
Our perception Our minds

THORENSEN
Wow You’re a real piece of work
Ventress

DR VENTRESS
Does Thorensen’s behaviour seem
rational to you at this moment
Does it seem sane

THORENSEN
See what she’s trying to do Radek
See how she’s trying to twist this

DR VENTRESS turns back to THORENSEN

DR VENTRESS
You really can’t see that what’s
happening in this room is exactly
what happened on the previous
missions

RADEK
Thorensen - it is possible What
she’s saying

THORENSEN
Jesus Christ Don’t listen to her

RADEK
But it is possible Think about
what’s happening in this place
The things we’re seeing We could
all be locked in some kind of
rolling hallucination -
AT THAT MOMENT —
- RADEK is interrupted by the sound of SCREAMING

It’s a woman Coming from somewhere outside

And weve heard it before It’s the sound SHEPPARD made as
she was being killed in the forest

The screams fade out
A beat of stunned silence in the room
Broken by THORENSEN

THORENSEN
Sheppard

LENA
-- It can’t be Sheppard

THORENSEN
That was her

LENA
I saw her body

Another sudden burst of screaming

This time it sounds much closer and within it we can hear
words

SHEPPARD (0S)
Help me - oh God please - please
help me -

It cuts out again

DR VENTRESS
Kerans

LENA
She was dead I saw her body

THORENSEN
You’re telling me that’s not
Sheppard

LENA

It can’t be real
THORENSEN
So it’s a ‘hallucination’ That
were all sharing
BANG
All jump

Something has knocked against the barricaded FRONT DOOR of
the house

All heads turn to the sound of the noise
RADEK
(hyperventilating)
What was that

SHEPPARD (0S)
Please - please -

SHEPPARDS voice is right outside the door

Something scratches against the wood

THORENSEN
(calls)
Sheppard
SHEPPARD (0S)
Please Thorensen is that you Oh
God Im hurt Im hurt -

THORENSEN
Fuck

THORENSEN starts for the door

DR VENTRESS
Thorensen no

LENA struggles against her bindings

LENA
Radek - untie me

SHEPPARD (0S)
Im bleeding -

THORENSEN
It’s her I’ve got to let her in

RADEK is frozen staring at the door -

- as THORENSEN starts pushing back the dresser that
barricades it

THORENSEN (CONTD)
Sheppard - hold on -

SHEPPARD (0OS)
Hurry -

DR VENTRESS
NO

LENA
(yells)
Radek Untie me Now
RADEK finally reacts Moves to LENA pulling her KNIFE -
- but too late

THORENSEN has pulled the dresser back and pulled the door
open

It reveals the huge plant-enmeshed BEAR-CREATURE that killed
her

Lit now in the light from the room

- is the huge shape of the plant-enmeshed BLACK BEAR

Eyes reflecting light from the room as bright yellow discs
Long thorns cresting over its head and shoulders
Oddly elongated claws like a long hooks of a sloth

THORENSEN
Sheppard

The BEAR lifts a paw And makes a simple motion - an upwards
swipe across THORENSEN’S midriff

THORENSEN bends forward And something wet and heavy
splashes out of her stomach onto the floor

Then she drops to her knees then pitches forwards

at the feet of the BEAR

The BEAR turns to look at RADEK

And opens its jaws as if to howl

But instead it emits SHEPPARD’S high desperate scream
OVER THE SCREAM -

LENA
GET ME OUT

- RADEK’S knife slices through the rope tying LENA’S hands -
- just as the BEAR-CREATURE forces its way into the room
Charging RADEK LENA and DR VENTRESS

The women are knocked violently aside

LENA’S CHAIR breaks as she lands -

- allowing LENA to kick out of the ropes that tie her ankles
She crawls across the floor -

- as the BEAR turns to RADEK -

- and spears RADEK through the CHEST with a hooked claw
Lifting RADEK into the air her feet leaving the ground
RADEK is impaled but alive Hyperventilating Legs
bicycling in the air Hands trying pull herself off the
claw

LENA scrambles across the floor

Reaching for THORENSEN’S weapon which lies beside her body

Grabbing it

Turning -

- as the BEAR turns still holding RADEK suspended
And LENA OPENS FIRE with the AUTOMATIC RIFLE

Emptying the entire clip into the BEAR’S freakishly deformed
head

For a moment it remains upright

Then it topples like a felled tree

CUT TO THORENSEN -

- on the floor expelling a final gurgling breath as she

dies

EXT VILLE PERDU - SUNRISE

First light over the town

EXT VILLE PERDUHOUSEPORCH - SUNRISE

RADEK sits on the porch of the house slumped on a rotting
wicker chair

Her chest is bandaged - but the bandage is soaked through
with blood Her skin looks like white wax

Her eyes open
She sees LENA sitting beside her
LENA holds a water bottle to RADEK’S lips

RADEK
Thank you

RADEK’S voice is weak
She drinks a little

RADEK (CONT’D)
Dr Ventress

LENA
Gone about half an hour ago The
coast isn’t far so I’m sure she’1l
make it The only real purpose of
this expedition was to give her a
chance to reach the lighthouse
Find out what’s inside after all
these years
LENA pauses

LENA (CONTD)
I don’t much like her But I’m
glad she’1ll get what she wanted

A beat
Then RADEK glances at LENA

RADEK
Why didn’t you leave me here

LENA says nothing

RADEK (CONTD)
I can’t survive these injuries
You know that

No answer

RADEK (CONTD)
You plan going to stay with me
Until I die

LENA
Yes

RADEK nods
Then pauses

RADEK
It was strange hearing Sheppards
voice last night I suspect that
as she was dying part of her mind
became part of the creature that
was killing her

Beat
RADEK (CONTD)
It’s a terrible thought To die
frightened and in pain and have
that as the only part of you which
survives Trapped in the mind of
an animal
Beat
RADEK (CONTD)
I wonder if I’ll be trapped in you
Silence

RADEK (CONTD)
There’s morphine in the medical
kits

LENA
Radek -
RADEK
Give me whatever’s left Shut my
mind down Then shoot me
LENA
Radek please Don’t ask me to do
this
Silence

RADEKS gaze remains fixed on LENA’S face

Eventually LENA has to meet it

EXT VILLE PERDUSTATUE GARDEN - DAY

Sunlight in the statue garden
A few beats of quiet
Then the sound of a single gunshot

The retort slaps off the sides of the houses then vanishes
into the forest

A few beats later LENA appears

Face drained of colour and emotion
She stares at the foliate people

CuT TO -

- the statue garden

LENA has set all the figures on fire
She’s watching them burn

And she’s howling with rage and grief For RADEK SHEPPARD
THORENSEN and KANE

Setting fire to the forest feels like revenge
From orange flames wrapped around human forms -

- CUT TO BLACK

CAPTION

PART 3 - THE LIGHTHOUSE

curt TO -

EXT BEACH - DAY

A long hook of beach where the swamp gives way to the sea

Massively empty Miles of undulating dunes and the great
flat ocean

Along the beach strange shapes rise

Visually similar to the tumour-like growths on the plants and
buildings

but these are made of sand Like massive termite mounds
as much as thirty foot high morphed into spires and oddly
organic abstractions

Only one other landmark can be seen

A couple of miles distant seen through a blue haze of air
and sea spray

The LIGHTHOUSE

Slender tall And white - where one can still see of the
original construction behind the brightly coloured moss

Leading that direction a snaking line of footprints are
clearly visible in the damp sand

The trail left by DR VENTRESS
curt TO -

LENA

Standing on the pale sands
Wind pulls at her hair

She looks down at her arm

where the BRUISE has now resolved into something
immediately recognisable

The dark circle and blurred indication of patterns have
become a TATTOO

Exactly the same distinctive image that THORENSEN wore
The ouroboros

She touches it with her thumb as half-expecting it might
wipe away

And when she pulls her thumb away -

- something moves in her flesh

Not just a flex Much more fundamental

A bone shifting and contracting

Or a muscle worming its way to a new position

LENA closes her eyes

EXT THE OCEAN - DAY

From the ocean a single figure walks along the shore
Between the abstract SAND STRUCTURES

In the foreground the back of a huge whale-like creature
breaks the surface

then slides back beneath the waves

EXT BEACHLIGHTHOUSE - DAY

LENA stands on the beach

The LIGHTHOUSE is still a few hundred metres away

The area here is littered with bones and scraps of clothing
The scene of a massacre many years ago

Blown and blasted by the wind sand sun and salt

The bones look like ivory A bright red backpack has been
bleached pink The body beneath it has almost been
completely submerged into the dune

LENA reaches down and picks up the top half of a skull

The back of the skull morphs into the star-shape of a
vertebrae as it had been fused with its own backbone

LENA drops it back on the sand

Then continues towards the tall white lighthouse building

EXT LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

From the top of the lighthouse we watch LENA approach

Below at its base its door hangs open swinging in the sea
breeze knocking gently against its frame

INT LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

LENA enters the base of the lighthouse

Light filters down from the window thirty metres above
It illuminates a round room with some specific features

A wooden staircase winds up the circular wall to the top of
the structure

Abandoned on the floor there is some MILITARY GEAR A
BACKPACK surrounded by cannister-shaped GRENADES and a
RIFLE

Opposite where LENA enters there is a TUNNEL in the floor
about two metres in diameter At its entrance the wooden
boards have been pulled up and laid out as a kind of ramp
structure leading downwards

INSIDE the tunnel something glows The soft blue-green light
of phosphorescence

Finally in the middle of the room there is a VIDEO CAMERA on
a tripod The camera faces a long black scorch mark rising
up the curved wall from a blackened heap on the ground The
nature of the heap is unclear It’s charred and fused beyond
all recognition

LENA takes this all in

Her gaze finally settling on the CAMERA

curt TO -

EXT SWAMP - DAY

- the PLAYBACK ON THE CAMERA
Which opens TIGHT on SHELLEY screaming

SHELLY
GET AWAY GET AWAY FROM ME

It’s a blurred shaking image

PEYTON is trying to hold SHELLEY who is bare-chested and
struggling violently

KANE is holding a rifle on them both
All the soldiers are unkempt Unwashed Bearded

KANE
Let him go for Christs sake

PEYTON releases SHELLEY
SHELLEY breaks away Running for a tree-line
KANE opens fire

curt TO -

EXT SWAMP - DAY

- SHELLEY lying in the grass filmed by the CAMERAMAN
KANE and PEYTON stand either side
We can see that SHELLY has been shot in the chest

He’s not dead yet He’s making a wheezing sound as his
punctured lungs collapse

Now that the camera is focused and steady we can also see
that SHELLEY has some extremely strange deformations

On his neck there is a split or opening Effectively a
large tracheotomy shaped as a sideways mouth running from
the concave skin above his collar bone to under his chin
Inside the mouth where there might be a tongue there is
something fat and white and red It looks like a skinned
SNAKE Air bubbles through the blood around it and the
SNAKE is writhing slowly

There are more deformations on SHELLEYS arms Each one is
split just below the elbow into two

Each split has secondary protrusions finger-like at
irregular intervals

PEYTON looks haunted Jaw locked into a rictus

PEYTON
Oh God Shelley

KANE cuts PEYTON off -
- by lifting his gun and firing a quick burst into SHELLEY
In SHELLEY’S throat the skinned SNAKE judders and contorts

Then stops moving

KANE pulls at PEYTON’S shoulder

KANE
Come on

curt TO -

EXT BEACH - DAY

- the BEACH

KANE and PEYTON are standing on the sand facing the ocean
They appear to be waiting for something

After a few seconds it appears

First a disturbance in the water - as if caused by a quake
on the seabed a hundred metres from the shore

KANE jabs a finger

KANE
There It’s coming again

Then an area of water is rising as if forming a hill

Then the surface of the water breaks -

- and a DOLPHIN launches itself into the air

The DOLPHIN is the size of a BLUE WHALE

The vast creature holds for a moment suspended in mid-air
before gravity takes hold Pulls it down with an almighty
crash

KANE turns to the CAMERAMAN Wired Wide-eyed

KANE (CONTD)
Unreal

curt TO -

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

GREEN and WHITE NIGHT VISION
PEYTON is firing his machine gun at the night sky

Bright tracer rounds arc into the stars dipping slightly
then burning out

KANE
What the Hell are you doing

PEYTON

Killing it
KANE

You’re just shooting at stars
PEYTON

Where the fuck you think it came

from
He fires off another full clip
KANE
Quit wasting rounds You’re losing
it Peyton
PEYTON laughs Slams in a fresh magazine
PEYTON
(to himself)
Losing it Oh man
Turns to face KANE and the CAMERAMAN
PEYTON (CONTD)
Have you two taken a look in the
mirror recently Or even a look at
each other Cause you really
fucking should
PEYTON flips to his rifle’s underslung GRENADE LAUNCHER

PEYTON (CONTD)
Eat it you son of a bitch

A hollow thump - as the grenade is fired

Then an explosion high in the air like a firework
momentarily lighting up the sand and water

Then a moment of quiet
Waves lapping on the shore

KANE
Think you got it

PEYTON makes a sobbing sound

curt TO -

EXT BEACHLIGHTHOUSE

- the CAMERAMAN recording the area of bones in the dunes
near the lighthouse

curt TO -

EXT BEACHLIGHTHOUSE - DAY

- KANE and PEYTON

They’re a little distance away from the camera where the
dunes get flattened by the tides

PEYTON seems to be having some kind of seizure

He’s on all fours head dipped with his spine buckling as if
he’s retching

KANE isn’t helping

He just holds his rifle Watching

Then PEYTON lifts his head -

- revealing there is something wrong with the shape of his
skull At this distance it’s hard to tell what Some kind
of deformation that has elongated his face

Some words are exchanged between them

A beat

Then KANE shoots PEYTON

curt TO -

EXT BEACH - DAY

— KANE

He’s a long way distant from the camera Standing waist-deep
in the ocean

After a few moments KANE starts pounding the water with his
fists Screaming and yelling

The rage is miniaturised by the scale of the landscape
Voice almost lost against the surf

Then he stops
And looks back towards the CAMERAMAN
Stares

curt TO -

EXT LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

- KANE walking towards the lighthouse

Through the towering SAND STRUCTURES

curt TO -

INT LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

- KANE entering the lighthouse
He slips off his BACKPACK
Lays down his RIFLE

curt TO -

INT LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

- GREEN and WHITE NIGHT VISION

The camera position is locked-off on a tripod in the middle
of the room

It faces KANE

KANE is sat on the floor cross-legged with his back to the
curved wall

Holding something in his hands

KANE
I thought I was a man

KANE pauses
KANE (CONTD)
I had a life People called me
Kane But now I’m not sure

Beat

KANE (CONTD)
If I wasn’t Kane what was I

KANE looks at the CAMERAMAN

KANE (CONT’D)
Was I you Were you me

The CAMERAMAN doesn’t answer
KANE (CONTD)
My flesh moves like liquid My
mind is cut loose
Beat
Then KANE looks straight down the lens

His pupils glow like a cat’s eye in the infra-red light

KANE (CONTD)
I can’t bear it
He opens his palm
He’s holding one of the cannister-shaped GRENADES
He glances up at the CAMERAMAN
KANE (CONTD)
Ever see a phosphorous grenade go
off Shield your eyes They’re
kind of bright
KANE hesitates
KANE (CONTD)
And if you ever get back find

CAMERAMAN
I will

KANE pulls the pin on the grenade
There is a soft quick ticking like wristwatch by your ear
KANE gazes directly at the camera Unafraid

KANE
Five four three two -

THE NEXT MOMENT -
- the grenade detonates

A blinding white flame as if KANE is suddenly holding the
sun in his lap A high pressure rush of noise

Initially we can scarcely see KANE’S shape through the glow
Then it dims slightly starting to burn itself out

We see his blackened shape bend Fall forwards onto the sun
A couple of moments pass

The flare continues to die down

Then -

- the CAMERAMAN walks forward Stepping into frame

It’s our first ever view of him

His back is to us

He gazes at the hunched charcoal figure as it continues to
blaze with the fierce white light

Then he turns his head And in the etched light of the
phosphorous we see his face

It’s KANE
ON THIS -
- the image FREEZES

curt TO -

INT LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

— LENA

Staring at the small screen on the camera which remains
frozen on KANE’S face

LENA
(whispers)
No
Her eyes flick to the blackened heap under the scorch marks

Now able to make sense of the shape

LENA (CONT’D)
No no no

She is interrupted by a sound

A distorted scream Echoed and distant as if having passed
through passages and chambers

Female
DR VENTRESS

It’s coming from the torn up floorboards The TUNNEL that
leads down into bedrock

LENA looks to where the floorboards have been pulled up

To the tunnel entrance and the soft blue-green light

LENA controls her fear

Knuckles white around the grip of her rifle

INT UNDER THE LIGHTHOUSETUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

LENA makes her way down the tunnel gun raised

The walls continue the curve of the lighthouse above and the
floor is sloping downwards -
- which means the passage is corkscrewing into the ground
It is unclear how the rock has been cleared The walls
ceiling and floor are made of smooth black rock like

obsidian

The rock is rippled as if worn smooth by an ancient stream
or lava flow

It is seamed with PHOSPHORESCENCE - illuminating everything
in the way that sea creatures light their way in the depths

And the walls seem to be moving
Or gently undulating

The surface of the walls are covered in CILIA Tiny anemone
arms waving caught in the flow of slow-moving water

The flow movement is down Deeper into the tunnel As if

what lies inside is feeding on what lies outside and being
channeled along a vein and capillary structure

INT UNDER THE LIGHTHOUSETUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

As if from LENA’S POV -
- we continue

And as we circle downwards the ripples on the smooth black
rock walls become more pronounced

Then stop being random undulations

» and become FORMS

Organic Embedded into the rock like fossils

First there are fractal PLANT shapes Leaf branch fern
Then in the flora there are ANIMALS The patterned armour
of an alligator or its teeth of the fat swirl of tail The
snout and claw of a bear The curls of snakes The feather
imprints of birds wings

And then - we start to see HUMANS

A torso An arm A face trying to push out from between
the other forms Or finger tips stretched out as if trying

to grab or be grabbed

The tunnel has become a tableau A boiling sea of people and
creatures - melded and frozen in black marble

Animal into plant Plant into human Human into animal
And then -
- movement

Treacle slow but unambiguous No longer frozen No longer
fossils

The walls are alive
Or the things inside them are not dead
And at the moment of that realisation -

- the tunnel suddenly stops and opens out into a CHAMBER

INT UNDER THE LIGHTHOUSECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

The chamber is roughly semi-spherical Three quarters of a
sphere with the bottom levelled out into a floor

The sculpted forms of humans and animals continue across the
floor but as they rise up the walls they taper into curved
points

Either side of these points the walls are glassy smooth
The arrangement is similar to petals as if we are on the
inside of flower before it has unfurled The interior of a
vast lotus bulb

The very center of the chamber is particularly bright -
because it is to here that the phosphorescent veins and
channels all lead

And standing on this brightest point -

- is DR VENTRESS

The doctor is internally lit Cilia cover her skin like
undulating fur She shimmers gently

LENA hesitates in the entrance

She looks around

Up at the petal structure

Down at the energy feed beneath DR VENTRESS

Then back to the glowing figure of the doctor

LENA takes a step inside the chamber

LENA
-- Doctor Ventress

DR VENTRESS turns to LENA

She has the same expression as KANE when he appeared back
home

Alzheimer’s-like In her eyes there is confusion But
through the confusion a vibrating sense of fear

LENA (CONTD)
Dr Ventress - what’s happened to
you
DR VENTRESS hesitates As if half-remembering
DR VENTRESS
I had to know what it was What
was waiting I had to know

Beat

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
And now it’s inside me I can feel

it
LENA
It’s inside you
DR VENTRESS
Yes

LENA
What is inside you

DR VENTRESS

Something old The very oldest
thing From so far away From
stars Of stars

LENA
- Something alien

DR VENTRESS
Yes Alien

DR VENTRESS looks down at her glowing hands

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
It’s not like me It’s not like me
at all I don’t know what it
wants I don’t know what it wants
from me

The cilia on her palms move like wind over a wheat field

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
I think it doesn’t want anything
It doesn’t care It doesn’t feel
anything

As she talks something disturbing begins to happen to DR
VENTRESS

Splits complex fissures start rippling across her skin
if her form is becoming unbalanced

She can feel it The panic is rising in her voice

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D)
It’s more than death Nothing of
what we are will remain It’s
going to annihilate us That’s
what it is That’s what’s waiting
It’s annihilation

DR VENTRESS looks back at LENA desperately Panic now
surging

DR VENTRESS (CONTD)
Annihilation

Then DR VENTRESS can’t speak any more

She has started undergoing an extraordinary physical
transformation

As

It is a shape-shift of a kind that our mind cannot entirely

make sense of - like a computer animation of a four
dimensional shape casting a three dimensional shadow A

vector cube that unfolds and refolds from within itself its

interior indefinably becoming its exterior

IN THIS CASE - it is the doctor’s skin that is unfolding
refolding

Her face splits open like a starfish
From out of the starfish multiple circles of radiating
objects emerge Gold orbs each with unique radiating

Mandelbrot-like ferns

The rainbow ferns radiate ever-increasing size and
complexity

The concentric circles are endless

The sense of expansion becomes vast

Until the mesh of immense structural detail becomes -
- the mesh of undulating CILIA on skin

But DR VENTRESS is gone

Where she stood there is a shape

The ALIEN

and

A BEING

An uncoalescing fracturing form Made of light and ice
liquid Endless refractions

Glimpsed within these deliquescing shapes a creature from
the world of electron microscope images

Surrounded by radiating impressions of infinitely smaller
versions of itself

LENA and the BEING gaze at each other for a few hypnotic
seconds

Then the BEING starts UNFOLDING again Expanding collapsing
in on itself

And this time during the TRANSFORMATION -

- we see fleeting glimpses of other bodies and faces
SHEPPARD and THORENSEN PEYTON and MAYER Unknown team
members from the previous expeditions

For a moment it is RADEK who stands in front of LENA
Then DR VENTRESS again

Then the RADIATING SHAPES have filled the chamber

They surround LENA

Then LENA herself is starting to unfold Unravel like
fabric

LENA
No -

Through this -
- she lifts her gun
Like a dream -

- which shatters the moment she squeezes the trigger and
FIRES

BULLETS slam into the BEING
The rounds have an amazing effect

Where they hit the body a hole expands like a bullet into
ballistic gelatine - but does not contract

Where they penetrate the body they leave bright trails of
emerald light like sunlight through dust motes

For a moment the BEING is poised in this state
Hugely misshapen

Speared with brilliant green
Then it EXPANDS

TRANSFORMS

And RESOLVES -

- into a HUMANOID FIGURE

Sexless Featureless Having the arms legs head
of a human - man or woman But nothing else

No eyes or mouth or nose or muscle form
LENA is transfixed by the sight
The FIGURE turns to LENA

And we see its smooth facial area Internally lit

and torso

Cilia

covering the skin like undulating fur shimmering gently

A beat between the woman and the humanoid
LENA’S weapon is out

She has no more clips

She starts to run

The HUMANOID observes her run

Then it starts to follow her

The first step is slow

The second faster

The third is as fluid and powerful as LENA

It starts sprinting

INT UNDER THE LIGHTHOUSETUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

LENA sprints back up the tunnel

Stumbling over the shifting melded animalhuman shapes

Crashing to the ground
Scrambling back up
CuT TO -

- the HUMANOID In pursuit

And we see something strange happen
Where LENA fell and tripped -
- the HUMANOID does exactly the same thing

Falling in the same place In the same way A simulacrum of
LENA’S action

CuT TO -
- LENA reaching the TUNNEL exit

Climbing back up into the base of the lighthouse

INT LIGHTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

LENA scrambles across the room -
- towards the door to the LIGHTHOUSE
But she doesn’t make it

The HUMANOID simply appears in front of her before she
reaches the door

It is unclear how it got there

A frozen beat

Then LENA STRIKES the HUMANOID with all her strength

And moment later in a mirror of her actions -

- the HUMANOID STRIKES HER BACK - but with incredible power
LENA is sent flying backwards across the room

She collides with the CAMERA and TRIPOD

All skid across the room to the wall

But it has provided LENA with a weapon As the HUMANOID
reapproaches her she picks up the TRIPOD and swings it like
a club smashing the camera against the HUMANOID’S head

And again the HUMANOID mirrors the actions Using its arm
like a club

For a second time LENA is sent hurtling back across the room
by the force of the impact

But this time towards KANE’S BACKPACK

She collides with it and the PHOSPHOROUS GRENADES beside it

And as she gets to her feet the HUMANOID is again on her
Standing directly in front of her Featureless eyeless but
somehow watching

Utterly infinitely more powerful than she is

For the first time we see something beaten in LENA
Something broken

LENA
Please -

She expects a killing blow

And flinches -

- and the HUMANOID does the same
LENA sees

She immediately realises what we already know The HUMANOID
is mimicking her

She is fighting herself

We can see her thinking can this be true

The killing blow still hasn’t come

LENA lifts a hand

Fingers trembling with adrenaline and fear

And the HUMANOID’S opposite hand also rises

She pauses

The HUMANOID’S hand pauses

LENA’S hand starts moving again Until -

- she touches its cheek

An exact mirror of the gesture where she touched KANES face
at the start of the film when he appeared at their bedroom
at home

A beat

Then the HUMANOID raises its hand

LENA holds motionless suspended except for tight breathing
and trickling beads of sweat as the softly glowing hand
lifts to her face

Then -

- lightly touches her cheek also
And as it does so -

- the HUMANOID starts another FOLDING TRANSFORMATION
Rippling folding collapsing

And this time resolving itself as KANE

LENA gasps

For a moment the two face each other

Then LENA opens her mouth to speak

LENA (CONT’D)
- Kane

Beat

KANE
Kane

Another beat

REVEAL - at LENA’S feet - the PHOSPHOROUS GRENADES
CLOSE on LENA Processing Controlling herself
Then - slowly -

- she reaches down

Opposite her in a slightly delayed mirror action -

- KANE does the same

LENA’S hand closes around one of the metal cannisters

KANE does the same

KANE rises
A final beat
LENA watching KANES face
LENA
(whispers)
I’m sorry
Then LENA pulls the pin

KANE mirrors

Soft ticking from the cannisters

LENA rises again Never taking her eyes off KANE’S face

Seconds passing
LENA (CONTD)
(breathes )

Five four three two -
Then -
LENA drops the grenade -
- and throws herself sideways
KANE’S head turns sees -
- but he’s too late to fully react
LENA’S PHOSPHOROUS GRENADE DETONATES

And a moment later so does KANE’S

The interior of the lighthouse is suddenly illuminated by
stark white light

The route to the exit is blocked by the blaze

LENA scrambles for the STAIRS that spiral up to the top of
the LIGHTHOUSE

Climbs upwards

Beneath her is LIGHT and SMOKE

In the brightness we can glimpse the SHADOW SHAPE of the
HUMANOIDKANE - shape-shifting in silhouette

INT LIGHTHOUSETOP - DAY

LENA has reaches the top - a semi-circular balcony around the
old housing for the lamp

Below her is a fifty foot drop to the burning interior of the
lighthouse

The whole wooden structure of the building is starting to
burn

She kicks out a window

The jump to the ground looks lethal The lighthouse is
ringed with a concrete platform The only hope might be the
sloping sand dunes just beyond the ring of concrete which
could take the deadly impact out of the fall

But the fire behind doesn’t give her a choice Within a
minute her options will only be to jump or burn

LENA takes a step back to give herself the chance to run at
the window and propel herself through with enough force to
reach the dunes

But as the steps back she JOLTS

And TURNS

The HUMANOID is directly behind her

It’s burned Horribly damaged Locked into jittering
transformations none of which can quite resolve

Shadows of humans and creatures and alien forms flicker
across it All in expressions of agony

It is a TRULY NIGHTMARISH SIGHT

Reflexively LENA screams

In its broken mirror state the HUMANOID also screams
A maw appearing where a mouth might be

Then as if with a final effort it makes a FINAL
TRANSFORMATION -

- and resolves into LENA

A literal mirror image Down to the finest detail
Their stances mirror each other

They are dressed identically

They are smeared with blood identically

And we have literally no way of telling who is who
A frozen beat

Then one LENA lunges at the other

Strikes

Impacts

And one LENA topples backwards over the edge of the balcony -
- falling down into the phosphorous blaze

The other watches

TIGHT ON HER FACE

As she watches herself fall

Blank

Held
Face illuminated by the bleaching light
There is no clear indication as to which LENA lived and

which LENA died

EXT LIGHTHOUSE - SUNDOWN

WIDE on the burning LIGHTHOUSE

Long flames curl from the top window into a plume of dark
smoke

The sun is setting and is clustered with the psychedelic
colour refractions we always see through the Shimmer

Except that something is clearly happening

The movements and vibrations of the Shimmer are settling
And the colours are becoming less intense

Then all along the beach the SAND STRUCTURES start
collapsing First one then three then seven Then all
together

Wind collects them as they fall

And as they fall they REVEAL a figure walking across the
sand towards us

LENA

curt TO -

EXT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYVIEWING PLATFORM - SUNDOWN

- the viewing platform of the Southern Reach Facility where
people are exiting from the MESS HALL

Excitedly gathering to look at the view over the scrubland to
the tree-line

where the SHIMMER is now clearly melting away

And the refractions are reverting to the blues reds and
oranges of a normal beautiful sunset

PULL BACK
Wide

Then CUT TO -
EXT THE NIGHT SKY - NIGHT

- a STAR-FIELD in a night sky

Dense constellations The Milky Way
Drift down

Past the MOON

To the SOUTHERN REACH FACILITY

And a lone woman walking out of the tree line across

scrubland towards it
LENA

LENA (0S)
I want to see my husband

curt TO -

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYMEDICAL WARD - NIGHT

- a medical ward

the

LENA is walking down it with a DOCTOR alongside and two

SPEC OPS SOLDIERS following

DOCTOR
It was miraculous It happened the
same night that the Shimmer
disappeared His blood pressure
stabilised and his pulse rate
started to rise By the next
morning he was not only awake He
was lucid Coherent

They have reached a door in the ward

Through the glass panel LENA can see KANE inside

Sitting at a chair Gazing out of the window

DOCTOR (CONT’D)
There’s no trace of abnormality
anywhere in his system

LENA
Id like to see him alone

INT SOUTHERN REACH FACILITYWARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

LENA enters

Closes the door behind her

KANE looks round and they lock eyes
Neither speak

After a moment LENA goes to the WINDOW
Looks out at the NIGHT SKY

LENA
Are you Kane

Silence
Then KANE gives a slight shake of the head

KANE
I don’t know

Beat

KANE (CONT’D)
Are you Lena

LENA hesitates

Then turns to face him

BEHIND HER -

- we can see through the window to the night sky
And in that sky we see a SHOOTING STAR

Then another

Then another

curt TO -

INT LOWER ATMOSPHERE - NIGHT

- the shooting stars as FALLING METEORS

As we saw in the opening images of the film A hunk of rock
burning as it falls through Earth’s atmosphere

And as the nearest meteor splits apart we see in its core
Something shimmering

CUT TO BLACK
