FADE IN ON
EXT DAY A BUILDING ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN

A big sign identifies this old brick building as the home
of The Underground -- a weekly newspaper in the
Village Voice mode only scuzzier We see a big poster
outside showing the cover of this weeks edition A big
headline reads How to be a Crack Whore written over a
photo of a crack den in which we glimpse things better
left unseen Beneath the headline is written A special
report by Amy Klein

CUT TO
INT DAY THE ELEVATOR

Its one of those too-small elevators that you find in
older buildings There are several PASSENGERS on board
Among them is the aforementioned AMY KLEIN a woman in
her mid-twenties Shes all in black from her black
sneakers and black stockings up to her rimless black sun
glasses and jet black hair The only thing about her
that isnt black is a complexion so translucently pale
that it bespeaks only the most rare and grudging
familiarity with daylight She has a paper coffee cup
and a cigarette in the same hand and she alternates sips
of coffee with puffs of her cigarette with a practiced
proficiency She ignores the unhappy looks of her fellow
passengers She clearly has practice at this as well

CUT TO
INT DAY THE OFFICES OF THE UNDERGROUND

Little office cubbies scattered around a converted loft
space Mostly younger hip-East-Village-type EMPLOYEES
with a smattering of non-hip-East-Village types They

sit at desks typing at computers conferring at tables --
going about the business of turning out another issue

The entrance door which leads directly to the elevator
opens and Amy comes out leaving a cloud of smoke and
several disgruntled passengers behind her CYNTHIA the
girl at the reception desk sees her

CYNTHIA
Hey Amy

AMY
Morning

CYNTHIA

Morning It a 430 in the afternoon

AMY
Mmm

She keeps on walking into the work area Shes about to
sit down at her desk when an ASSISTANT calls to her

ASSISTANT
Amy

Amy looks The Assistant gives a broad gesture over her
shoulder pointing toward the Editors office across the
work space Amy comes back up nodding and heads across
the way toward the office The Assistant picks up the
phone

ASSISTANT
(on phone)
Mr Firenzi Amys here Right

CUT TO
INT DAY BUD FIRENZIS OFFICE

BUD FIRENZI the Editor-in-Chief is a man in his early
forties sporting a pony tail which like a moustache on
a sixteen-year-old only serves to emphasize his true
age Hes fiddling around with some sort of TVVCR set
up and is looking away from the door as it opens and Amy
enters behind him

BUD
(without turning)
Ah I detect that unique and ubiquitous
combination of female sweat and
patchouli oil that signals the arrival
of

He turns toward a dour Amy

BUD
-the delightful Amy Klein
AMY
Eat me Bud
BUD

He opens the door and leans out

BUD
Lar Larry Can you come on over

Amy meanwhile spots an open container of Chinese food
on Buds desk She inspects it then picks something out
of it with a pair of chop sticks

AMY
So what Are we being sued again

BUD
Hmm Oh no

Please feel free to have some of that

AMY

He heads back over to the VCR Amy ditches the Chinese
food and picks up her coffee again She sits lights
another cigarette

BUD

finds the button presses it

The two exchange a glance Larry waves the floor to Bud

sixties were You see ‘em in the
park sometimes

BUD

AMY
No Bud Ive never heard of

LARRY

Show her the tape

Bud goes to the VCR and hits the play button Amy finishes
her coffee and lights a new cigarette with the still-
glowing butt of her last one She leans forward

ON THE TAPE

The image flickers into view Its handheld low-rez
clearly been shot in some dingy apartment somewhere
decorated in a mattresses on the floorbeer spray on the
walls type decor There are around half a dozen PEOPLE
there in their twenties and younger They drift in and
out of frame in and out of focus

We hear a womans voice -- clearly the person who is
operating the camera as the camera moves about the room
This is MARLA CHEN

MARLA
(off screen)
Okay okay Here we go Theres
Marybeth

The camera hesitates for a fleeting moment on MARYBETH a
girl with bright dye-red hair (on the side of her head
that isnt shaved) Marybeth looks with no particular
expression and goes away

The camera turns toward a smudged mirror an the wall and
we get a look at Marla a twenty-ish Asian girl

MARLA
Heres Marla Chen official Deader
Archivist Hello me

The camera turns toward a door as it opens and SHEILA a
young round-faced girl with dark hair comes out looking
a bit nervous

MARLA
(off screen)
And heres the star of the show
Sheila

She gives a little smile The camera swings over toward
a mattress on the floor Some of the people are tugging
a plastic sheet over it

One of them and The one who clearly appears to be in
authority is a rather average-looking serious man with
glasses WINTER Another is a round-faced young man
also looking a bit pale and nervous CARL

MARLA
And heres our deader bed -- this is
the scene of the crime Crime to be

The image moves in on Carl

MARLA
Heres our new Revivalist How you
feeling Carl

CARL
Hmm Okay Stare Okay

The camera moves in on Winter

MARLA
And here is the fearless leader of
the Deaders

Winter glances up then dismisses the camera altogether
He looks off screen then raises his hand The room
Quiets We hear various voices

VOICES
Shh Quiet Were starting

Winter looks toward Carl clearly waiting for a response

CARL
Its ready

We dont know exactly what he means but it seems to be
the right answer Winter looks up and the camera swings
toward Sheila She hesitates A girl next to her starts
to prompt her

GIRL
Say

SHEILA
(cuts her off)
Okay Okay
(reciting)
My skin isnt real My eyes arent
real My muscles arent real My
bones my heart my veins and nerves
and flesh and meat arent real
(MORE )

SHEILA (CONTD)
What I see what I hear what I taste
what I touch what I remember what I
think what I feel arent real

WINTER
(off screen)
Go on

SHEILA
Im not real

The camera swings back to Winter who gestures for her to
come forward then swings back to see her coming

The various people in the room gather around as she comes
to the mattress The camera moves this way and that
Trying to get the best angle to cover the action People
spread towels on the mattress over the plastic as
Sheila unbuttons her long shirt and tugs it off Shes
naked underneath She sits down on the towels then lays
back flat on the mattress

Winter looks to Carl He fumbles around in a bag and
Comes up with a big handgun -- maybe a 45

SHEILA
Im not real

The camera moves in closer as Carl takes the gun and slips
it into Sheilas hand

SHEILA
I m not Im not real

She slides the gun over and puts it to the side of her
head

AMY

--Sits forward in her seat not quite believing what
shes seeing

AMY
Holy shit Bud

BUD
Just keep watching

ON THE TAPE

Sheila is breathing fast now but we cant be sure if
its terror or passion or some combination of both
She continues to lie on the mattress the barrel of the
gun pressed against the side of her head

SHEILA
Im not real Im not

Carl reaches out hesitant and cocks the gun in her
hand Meanwhile we see other bands reaching in
Pressing a folded up towel-against the opposite side of
her head Other hands come in and press a doubled-over
pillow against the towel

SHEILA
Im not real Im not Im not
She closes her eyes grits her teeth
Her back arches

AMY

Drops her cigarette as it burns down to her fingers She
stands

ON THE TAPE
Sheila holds her breath and pulls the trigger
Theres a huge CONCUSSION as the bullet tears straight
through her head We can see it splatter out the other
side tearing through the towel and the folded over
Pillow which catch a great blast of bone and brain
We hear some screams in the room
AMY
Jumps back
AMY
Fuck
(to Bud)

Have you called the police on this

BUD
Just watch

AMY
I want to know if youve called the
pol

BUD
I said Just watch

LARRY
I tell you its bullshit

AMY
Oh man dont tell me that was some
fucking special effect

LARRY
You tell us

Larry sitting cross-legged in a chair points back to
the screen Amy turns

ON THE TAPE

The camera is now pointing at Carl who is tugging off
his own clothes

AMY
(voice over)
Oh man this is fucking sick

BUD
(voice over)
Thats saying a lot for you

Carl now stripped down hesitates looks at Winter
Winter reaches over and kisses him on the lips Carl
Looking scared turns down toward Sheila who is lying
as dead as dead can be on the mattress Blood has run
from the ghastly wound down both sides of the plastic
and towels on-the side of the bed catch the mess

Carl reaches down and plucks the gun from Sheilas
Lifeless hand and then very gingerly lies down on
top of her

The camera moves forward and down as Marla presumably
elbows hex way through for a better vantage point The
camera moves in close as Carl stretches out along

Sheilas body He places his lips on hers kissing her --
or maybe something else It seems almost as if hes
breathing into her His body moves as his lungs expand
and expel and he seems to be struggling toward some non-
sexual climax

AMY

watches both repelled and fascinated

ON THE TAPE

Carl continues his odd ritual finally taking a great

final breath as if hes reached the point of exhaustion
and expels it Nothing happens

WINTER
(off screen)
Again
Finding what ever remaining reserves he has Carl draws
in another breath -- he seems to be in agony as he does
it -- presses his lips to Sheilas dead ones and
Exhales The breath seems to go on forever -- longer

than it should

And then when it seems as if he cant breathe out
Another teaspoon of air Sheilas body abruptly twitches
beneath him

AMY

watches not quite believing it -- not knowing what to
make of it

ON THE TAPE

Sheilas body twitches again -- and then she sucks in a
ragged breath Her previously open and lifeless eyes
move Her head raises up

Carl exhausted looks down at her smiling Theres
nervous laughter sounds of relief from around the room
Carl slides off of her Sheila looks this way and that
presumably at The others looking down at her

A hand reaches down and she takes it The camera follows
as Carl pulls her unsteadily up to standing All this
despite the fact that there is still an exceedingly large
and obvious hole in Her head the size of a dime on
one side the size of a half-dollar on the other

The others move in touching her congratulating her
Shes still a bit shaky uncertain Then she lifts one
of her hands to the side of her head -- the side with the
big exit wound She touches it gingerly confirming that
it is really there

Then she slowly slides her fingers IN They penetrate

her skull unobstructed to the second knuckle Sheila
takes her fingers from this ghastly wound and stares at
them bloody Yet shes alive Fine She looks up at

the others then smiles widely The others move in giving
her hugs pecks on the cheek

SHEILA
(as if actually
realizing it)
I m fine

She touches the wound again

SHEILA
I feel great

She starts laughing

SHEILA
Oh man Oh man

The image cuts off goes to snow There is a moment of
silence Amy turns to Bud

AMY
What the fuck
BUD
Thats what I said
AMY
Have you have you found any of
these
BUD

We havent done anything I told
you we just looked at it today By
some chance are you interested in
pursuing this

Amy hesitates shaking her head not sure what its all
about

LARRY
Its a waste of time

BUD
Yeah Larry here doesnt find any of
this at all intriguing

LARRY
Oh I was intrigued Because I cant
figure it out how they did it But I
know one thing Shit like this is
only intriguing so long as its a
mystery So let em run it on Unsolved
Mysteries or something because all
bullshit aside Amy Amy we all
know deep down inside what the
solution to the mystery La The
solution is -- they faked it This
is just some kind of bullshit shot-
on-tape gore movie

(MORE )

LARRY (CONTD)
And since thats all it can be thats
all youre going find Let “em
let em use it in some bullshit TV
special They can run it after Alien
Autopsy Part III

BUD
Look Ame Maybe this is just what
Larry says but it sure smells
Different to me Im not saying that
weve just witnessed a bona fide
miracle The fact is I dont know
what the hell its about I dont
know who these people are but Id
like to know If my dear colleague
here is right and its bullshit youll
know pretty fast If its not

Amy though is only half listening lost in her own
thoughts She turns to the two men

AMY
How could she

She lifts her fingers to the side of her head duplicating
the action of Sheila slipping her fingers inside the wound

LARRY
Amy you know what my father said
once

BUD

That all writers were queers

LARRY
No that was a different time This
time we were driving down the block
and there was this fortune-telling
place you know this gypsy fortune
telling place in a store front And
he said You know if I could tell
the future I sure as shit wouldnt be
living in any frigging store front
Amy if somebody could do that for
real theyd wouldnt be hanging out
in some rundown basement Theyd own
the fucking earth

AMY
But how could she

She once again duplicates the gesture of putting her
fingers into the aide of her head

LARRY
Amy its a magic
from the kind of
stage Just nos
German faggots
(no reaction)
Amy

AMY
(to Bud)

Amy hesitates

CUT TO
DE TENEMENT

She pulls an envelope out of
t the tape came in

She checks the name on the envelope -- MARLA CHEN -- then
checks the buzzers She Presses one waits No answer

As she presses the button again a thin young MAN comes
up the stairs behind her and unlocks the door Still
receiving no answer to her ringing she casually follows
him in

INT DAY THE SECOND FLOOR

We see the Young Man coming up the stairs with Amy

Behind him They both reach the second floor and head
down it As they start down the hallway appropriately
ignoring one another Amy winces and crinkles her nose

AMY
God it smells like something died in
here

The Young Man sensing the need for a response looks
back as he goes to his door

YOUNG MAN
Ive been complaining to the super
about it for a week

Amy meanwhile has found the appropriate door She knocks
at it

YOUNG MAN
It must be a dead mouse in the walls
or something

AMY
Something bigger than a dead mouse

As she says it her eyes suddenly come to rest on the
door in front of her She stops in mid-knock

YOUNG MAN
This place I should move back to
Connecticut

AMY

Dont let me stop y
Theres a bang as the Young Man enters his apartment

AMY
Dont let me stop you

She hesitates staring at the door then leans forward
and sniffs The results are inconclusive Then she lays
herself flat down on the floor presses her nose up
against the bottom of the door and sniffs

She jumps back scrambles up to her feet goes to the
stairs She almost slips as she rounds the corner
heading down

CUT TO
INT DAY THE SECOND FLOOR

A short time later A big black guy THE SUPER is at
the door He too is sniffing but not down on his knees

SUPER
I see what youre saying I see
Thing is thing is I dont have
a key

AMY

Then break it

SUPER
No who did you say you

AMY
Im Marla s sister Amy Look

SUPER
Youre Marla s sister You aint t

AMY
Shes my half sister Same Mom
Different Dads Hey

SUPER
Okay okay I see what youre saying
Can I just you want I should just
kick the door in you want me to get
my tools

AMY
Um just kick it I guess

SUPER
Okay

The Super steps back and slams his foot against the door
It gives slightly Another couple kicks and the door
pops open

SUPER
Oh man

He and Amy recoil clutching their faces from the smell
The Super heads down the hallway retching

Amy stands facing away from the door willing herself to
stand where she is She inhales -- drawing in the smell
to acclimate herself -- and almost vomits She steadies
herself drawing in breaths through her nose tentative
at first and finally in larger breaths until she can
tolerate it

She looks back toward the Super who is staring at her
from the far end of the hall looking vaguely embarassed

SUPER
Im sorry

Amy looks at him then turns and pushes her way through
the broken door

CUT TO
INT DAY MARLAS APARTMENT

Amy steps in and stops struggling to keep herself from
retching

She hesitates then reaches up and takes off her
sunglasses and slips them into a pocket This is the
first time we see her eyes as they scan this dim
prosaic place of death

This is an average east village one bedroom apartment
relatively bare -- some furniture rescued from the
garbage some books some magazines some nondescript art
posters on the wall No sign in the living room of
anything dead No sound except the sinister buzzing of
flies Amy steps cautiously in

She looks toward one side sees a closet with a double
sliding door She slides open one side sees nothing

that shouldnt be there -- a ragged winter jacket a green
plastic rain coat a hangar festooned with scarfs some
other garments still obscured beneath cleaning bag
plastic

She hesitates then calmly slides the other side open
More of the same

She turns in the other direction Theres a little
kitchen Nothing dead there She starts forward then
turns back --staring at the refrigerator She goes
quickly over and tugs it open Its empty Not so much
as a ketchup bottle Curious she opens the freezer
The same Empty

She heads into the living room and down a narrow corridor
leading to the bedroom

She rounds a turn and finds herself looking down the
hallway toward the open-door to the bathroom some fifteen
feet away

Marla is there

The door to the bathroom is open and the toilet on the
far wall faces the door Marla dressed only in bra

and panties is sitting on the closed lid of the john
leaning forward in what seems at first to be an
impossible angle Her hands hang forward almost touching
the floor Her head is cocked back staring up Her

skin is gray swollen

Amy takes a few steps forward for a better look As she
approaches she sees the reason for the odd position of
the body

A long bootlace has been tied around Marlas neck and
tied to the wall pipe on the toilet The flesh of her
neck has swollen out almost burying the bootlace She
has hanged herself in this ghastly way

Amy takes another step forward As she does theres a
sudden loud buzzing as the flies that crawl on Marla
abruptly rise up alarmed (or whatever it is flies are)
at her approach But they soon return to the corpse
crawling about the face around the edges of the glazed
eyes around the margins of the open mouth rimmed with
dry foam -- around the outthrust tongue

Amy steels herself -- and then walks closer She looks
into the bathroom On the corner of the sink theres a
thick manilla envelope with something bulky inside --
something that looks just like a cassette tape Theres
a name written on it and the marker is right next to it

She takes another step forward trying to read the name
and then hears something -- a sound of movement coming
from the living room behind her She turns and hurries
back the way she came

She rounds the corner every nerve awake
Its the Super standing half inside the door a
handkerchief over his nose and mouth still unwilling to

come in

SUPER
What What

AMY
Shes dead

SUPER
Dead
AMY
She I think she hanged herself
In the bathroom
SUPER
And shes just been there that

smell God Im sorry I should
have come up before

AMY
What Look Go call the police all
right Just go call the police and
wait for them Okay Can you do
that

SUPER

Ill go do that

(still on a different

track)
Im a religious man Its just I
should have done something I guess
But you never know whats going on in
somebodys head At least I should
have come up when people started
complaining about the smell I
shouldnt have just left her there
all these days

AMY
Its okay

SUPER
Its terrible that she should just be
there like that All these days
Im so sorry

AMY
Its okay Go on and call the police
and and wait for them down stairs
SUPER

Ill go Ima religious man I
really am

He turns stricken and departs Amy moves fast to
door closes it (as much as it will close) and then
back to the apartment Then she rushes back to the
bathroom

Again as she approaches theres the great buzz as
flies rise from the body

the
turns

the

Amy steps into the bathroom and then reaches for the
tape She has to come horribly close to the body to do
it She grabs it and pulls back looks at the name on
it It reads Winter

Without further ado Amy stuffs it into her bag Then
she turns and hurries into the adjoining bedroom

IN THE BEDROOM

Amy starts to search -- fast thorough -- shes done
this sort of thing before She finds a journal opens
it no writing She tosses it aside Pulls open a

drawer She tugs out what looks like a bladeless knife
handle She presses a stud A stiletto blade snicks
out She tosses it back in the drawer tugs some other
stuff into view

Some bills some shoelaces loose change An address
book She grabs it up shoves it into her bag She goes
drawer to drawer looking for anything that might mean
something Socks ragged underwear cheap jewelry tee
shirts and short skirts and jeans

Amy stops surveying the territory Where to look next
Then deciding she goes to the bed

She reaches under it sliding her hand around tugs out a
dust-encrusted skirt Feels around some more hesitates
pulls something else out She brings it out into view
Its a dessicated mouse She grimaces and tosses it back
under the bed in disgust

She stops then slides her hand between the mattress and
the box spring She feels around then stops finding
something She pulls out a little red paper folder --
the kind that photographs come from She opens it

It appears to be a photographic record of another
Deader party We see some of the same participants --
only we also see Marla herself in some of the pictures
Shes smiling clowning Amy flips the next photograph

It shows a stool -- just that the featured object of the
photograph It is draped in plastic ready -- like a
photo of the altar before the wedding And then Amy turns
a photograph and it shows somebody holding something out
in front of Marla A length of rope with a noose on one
end Marla is on the other side framed by it -- a kind
of joke photo

She has a kind of sickly smile on her face Amys eyes
narrow She holds the picture closer

The red-haired girl Marybeth is visible in the shadows
in the back of the photograp ph -- or is she Because the
closer Amy looks e more it seems as if the girl is
somehow literally half-melted into the wall with only
her face and a part of a shoulder emerging from it Am
holds the picture closer -- its hard to tell The gir
is lost in shadows and the closer she looks the more
reality merges with the grains of the photo

Then theres another noise Nothing loud or drastic but
it brings Amy up short A tiny scratching sound followed
by a different sound a sound weve heard before The
sound of-the flies abruptly rising from Marla s corpse --
as if something has disturbed them

Amy turns toward the door that leads to the hall and the
unseen bathroom She sits silent waiting

Then the sound of the flies rising comes again -- and
again more distinct -- something scratching She keeps
her position still listening Nothing Just the slow
steady untroubled buzzing

She stands

And again theres the tiny scratching and the rush of
sound as if something has disturbed the flies She
jumps drops the photos They scatter on the floor

She hesitates an instant then moves cautiously toward
the door which stands at right angles to the bathroom
As she moves around she can look in through the bathroom
door but Marlas hanging body still isnt in view

She advances until she can glimpse the edge of one of
Marlas hanging outthrust hands the tip of one finger
just touching the floor Marlas long fingernails are
painted green Then as she watches the finger twitches
the long green-painted nail scratching on the tile floor
The flies rise and fill the air

Amy gasps and rushes forward
THE BATHROOM

She comes around the edge of the bathroom door Perhaps
instinctively she has interpreted the movement as a sign
of life but whatever she may have thought she comes up
cold as she takes a step toward the corpse -- and Marla’s
head turns toward her

It is still tied to the pipe by the shoelace The shoelace
is still buried in her throat The flies buzz up again
The glazed eyes turn in their sockets toward her

Amy stands half-leaned over toward the body literally
paralyzed Marlas lips move the swollen tongue as well
as if shes struggling to speak A ghastly wet sound
comes out

Amys mouth is open too and she is hyperventilating in
terror Abruptly she looks -down -- One of Marlas hands
has reached up and is grabbing at the edge of her skirt
tugging on it

Amy lets out some kind of cross between a shriek and a
squeak and swats the dead hand away As she does she
literally falls backward onto the floor But her
paralysis is broken She rolls over and in a half-
crawl half-scramble gets herself back up to her feet

THE LIVING ROOM

She tears down the hall through the living room and out
the door

CUT TO
INT DAY THE HALL AND STAIRWAY

Amy comes flying down the hall at top speed She reaches
the top of the stairs and starts down and as she does
her feet slip

She slides down five or six steps then over-balances
throwing out her hands to keep her chin from hitting the
polished stone steps She keeps sliding down finally
over-balancing again flipping over and landing on her
back on the landing half-way between the floors

AMY
Oh fuck fuck

She rolls up against the wall wrapping her arms around
her legs in pain

AMY
Oh Christ

The Super appears at the bottom of the stairs

SUPER
Are you okay I called the police
Did you fall Look just stay where
you are

Clearly the thought of staying where she is doesnt do
it for Amy She gets up and hurries down the remaining
stairs clearly limping in pain

SUPER
Are you okay
AMY
Im fine Im fine Im fine Ill
be back in just a minute Im okay

She heads for the door fumbles impatiently then almost
frantically with the latch until it opens and she rushes
out

CUT TO
EXT DAY THE SIDEWALK

She comes down the stairs and almost collapses against a
mail box gasping struggling to regain both her breath
and her composure People are on the streets walking
by studiously ignoring her

A siren part of the background noise of the street
starts growing louder She turns and looks up the block
in time to see a police car turning down the street She
feels frantically for her shoulder bag -- its still
there then turns and limps off down the block

CUT TO
INT NIGHT AMYS APARTMENT

Cluttered full of books and mess It might almost be a
guys apartment Right now the lights are off and Amy is
sitting on the floor in front of her couch now dressed
in only panties and a bra -- an image unpleasantly
reminiscent of Marla -- especially with the spotting of
bruises and roughly bandaged scrapes on her pale skin

She has a dripping ice pack in one hand which she
applies to this bruise and that -- and a bottle of gin in
the other She doesnt look happy She takes a drink
then looks toward a TV and VCR in front of her

Theres a tape half-inserted into the VCR We can see
the empty envelope with Winter written on it lying on
the floor

The tape is within reach of Amys bare foot and she

lifts a toe toward it hesitant She puts her toe against
the tape-hanging on the edge of decision Finally she
shoves it forward with her toe

It slides into the machine She grabs up the remote and
turns on the set

The IMAGE appears

Its Marla looking very pale -- unnaturally pale Shes
wearing big wing-tipped sunglasses Amy watches

ON THE TAPE

Marla speaks looking into the camera

MARLA
Im sorry I just cant hold it
together I just keep forgetting

and then I start slipping and the
more I slip the harder it is to make

it work Im just I sent a copy
of Sheilas change to a newspaper I
thought if if other people saw it

and started believing that would
help maybe even help all of us

But it didnt make any difference I
dont know what to do now I dont
want to end up like Bobby And Im
starting to feel pain too I just
keep forgetting Im slipping
back My eyes hurt The light really
hurts

She takes off her glasses Her eyes look glazed over --
dead eyes

MARLA
And theyve gone like this Like
Bobby I dont know how to get back

I just dont want it any more I

just want to end it Im sorry I
cant believe enough I just dont
want to be here any more I cant
I

She moves forward and shuts off the camera It goes black
for a few seconds and then changes to snow

Amy sits staring at the snow her face empty A phone
rings somewhere It shakes Amy out of her fugue

She leans over and drags a lap top toward her The phone
apparently is plugged into it -- one of those headphone
type things She drags it up off the floor slips it on
answers it

AMY
Yeah

(on the phone)

AMY

She hangs up She waits a moment hesitates -- then tugs
the laptop closer She types something in

We see a White Pages Directory flash on the screen Amy
types in the name of Marla Chen She comes to an M Chen --
checks the address It matches

She highlights the number then puts the pointer at the
dial indicator She waits as if for a sign from above
but none comes Then she hits the button The phone
rings One twice three four then theres a click

A mans voice sounds on the other end Maybe familiar
We cant really be sure

VOICE
Hello

AMY
Um hi is Marla there

Theres a long pause

VOICE
Who is this

AMY
Um this is her sister Amy

VOICE
Hold on

Theres a clunk as if the phones been put down then
some sounds of motion Amy waits Then the phone is
picked up again But theres no hello

AMY
Hello Hello

Then a sound comes over the line -- a hoarse gurgling
sound - a ghastly wet sound - the same sound Amy heard
coming from the throat of the hanged Marla

Amy gasps yanks the headset from her head She punches
frantically at the key board disconnecting the line
then shoves the whole thing away from her She sits
breathing fast for a second then she gets up moving
fast

CUT TO
INTNIGHT A SUBWAY STATION

Lit with cold flourescent light -- this is one of the
stations that hasnt been renovated in many a year Amy
now dressed with her sunglasses in place slides her
card through the slot and shoves through the turnstyle
She descends the long non-working escalator -- the only
one on it at this time of night

She reaches the subway platform It is virtually empty

Amy has come down stairs that land her just about in the
middle She looks one way -- far down the platform a
lone FIGURE in a shiny green plastic raincoat lies
slumped over on one of the few benches Amy looks the
other way -- a couple middle-aged SLACK GUYS in uniform
maybe heading for some night shift somewhere stand not
moving hands thrust in pockets

She starts moving slowly along the platform staring down
looking for something She stops

Theres a tiny symbol painted near the edge of the
platform -- the stencil of a red flower She takes up a
position at the spot She waits

A moment later a bit of a breeze starts moving her hair
A few seconds later a train comes roaring into the
station Amy watches the car pass her one by one as
the train slows The train is virtually empty One car
after the next rolls by as the train slows

Amy waits

Finally as the train moves slowly to a stop a car
different from the others comes in This one for some
odd reason seems to have newspaper covering all the
windows -- taped up from the inside

One of the doors of the covered car comes to a stop
directly in front of the spot where Amy is standing --

the spot marked by the stenciled rose Theres a pause
then the doors slide open -- just one the one set in

front of Amy The others stay closed The interior of
the car is dark -- the lights apparently are not working

A tall BLACK MAN in a conductors uniform is standing
there He gestures toward the adjoining car with a nod
of his head

BLACK MAN
Next car

AMY
Is Joey on this ride

BLACK MAN
Come on in

She enters The doors slide closed The train pulls
out

CUT TO
INT NIGHT IN THE SUBWAY CAR

The interior of the car has been transformed into some
odd-ball cross between a very small nightclub and an opium
den Anyway there are PERFORMERS at the far side who
start playing as the train pulls out

As the train passes out of the station and the lights
dim we can see the lights from joints and crack pipes --
or at any rate something being smoked in some kind of
pipe glinting in the darkness

Various hands reach up and tug down the newspapers and
the tunnel lights come in providing a flickering
constantly changing illumination

In the uncertain light Amy can see the various
CELEBRANTS hanging out --- some on the seats some on the
floor some dressed some partially undressed some
engaging in desultory drug use others in desultory sex
acts -- mostly teenagers and twenty-nothings

Amy looks around -- not taking her dark glasses off and
not particularly effected by the oddness of the scene
The Black Man in the Conductors uniform touches her arm

BLACK MAN
Down that way

He gestures toward the opposite side of the car from the
place where the Performers are playing She threads her
way through the tangle of people In the flickering
lights she catches glimpses of pale human flesh pierced
faces pierced nipples -- pierced things that we cant
even be sure what they are

Expressions flash by in the flickering light some dull
others laughing She pretty much ignores it all as she
makes her way toward the rear of the car

There illuminated in flashes JOEY a thin ill-shaved

guy in his mid-twenties is sprawled on a seat One of

his lower eyelids has a ring in it It flicks up every
time He blinks

A young GIRL is kneeling on the subway floor in front of
him obscuring his lower quarters apparently giving him
a blow job

Joey looks up and spots Amy He points an accusing finger
at her but his mood is good-natured Throughout the
course of the following conversation the girl continues
her activities ignored by both Joey and Amy

JOEY
Bah Amy fucking Klein Bah And I
quote Joey Gambo master of this
moveable MTA fuck and drug feast sits
on his G-train throne like a terminal
King Midas squatting on a solid gold
toilet seat Thats the thanks I
get I let you into my life I open
my heart to you And you make me feel
soiled

AMY
You are soiled Joey I only owe
anybody the truth ugly though it may
be

JOEY
Uh huh You know I hold a grudge Amy
Klein Thats part of what makes me
what I am And Im holding one against
you You disdained me in public and
one day I will make you suffer -- so
long as it doesnt require any effort

AMY
Yeah okay Understood

Joey casually gestures to the girl between his legs

JOEY
Can I interest you in some oral sex

AMY

JOEY
Oh her I dont go for that sort of
thing Its not me Its the whole

AMY
I know I know The whole hair in

thinking of closing this thing down

AMY

JOEY
My life rolls on The thrill is gone
Im thinking of becoming an urban
survivalist You know I have that
shaman-guru thing going Maybe have a
harem or something Five or six wives
Twenty or thirty kids Lots of high
powered fire arms

(MORE )

JOEY (CONTD)
Only instead of doing it out in shit

JOEY

Amy comes in close to him

AMY

I need to ask you about something
JOEY

-dick Go ahead

AMY
A girl named Marla Chen Another
girl named Marybeth with red hair
and half her head shaved Another
girl named Sheila A guy named Carl
A guy with glasses named Winter

Joeys eyes narrow Something has clearly clicked He
laughs slightly starts shaking his head

JOEY
Ho oh man You mixed up with those
mother fuckers now You know what
theyre about

AMY
You know about them

JOEY
I know maybe this much

He holds up his thumb and index finger around a tenth of
an inch apart

JOEY

If it was up to me Id know this
much

He squeezes thumb and index finger together He stares
at her laughs again

AMY
Im trying to find them

JOEY
Oh jeez Moral quandary time here
What should he do what should he do
If he tells her -- the relatively
cute and still eminently fuckable Amy
Klein is thrown into the pit of
oblivion -- or anyway is potentially
fucked up for life A waste If he
refrains from telling her she may
yet be saved And yet theres
that grudge Angel and devil on the
shoulder hmm Angel devil angel
devil Oh fuck it Entropys
destroying everything anyway Why
shouldnt I do my part

AMY
Tell me what you know Joey About
the Deaders

JOEY
You answer me first What do you
think they do

AMY
I think they bring the dead

JOEY
Hold on hold on Im coming

He puts a hand lightly on the girls head between his
legs If this is orgasm its a very controlled one
Basically it looks like hes waiting for a sneeze that
never comes Then apparently its done

JOEY
Okay Im done Bye bye

The girl gets up and Joey tucks himself away

GIRL
You taste funny

JOEY
I am funny

The girl yawns and wanders off into the confusion of
people

JOEY
(to Amy)
Go on

AMY
I think they bring the dead back to
life

He holds up the thumb and forefinger again a tenth of an
inch apart

JOEY
Thats not even that much Is that
what you think That these are like
a bunch of Doctor Frankensteins
That like theyre zombies and doing
that voodoo shit or something Casting
spells and shit Its all about minds
and believing and whats real and
whats not You get deep enough into
that shit -- I dont know what it is --
but you never come back I know people
who went in Sometimes you see them
but its like -- theyre not there
Not really And Im not talking not
there mental Im not really there
mental Im talking not there
physical You understand

AMY
No

JOEY
I dont either When somebody turns
into a fucking ghost And Im not
kidding For all I know they could
be listening now Right now Im not
fucking around Sometimes I walk
down the street at night I start
wondering who the fuck is real and who
isnt

AMY
Who are they Where can I find them

JOEY
I dont know who this Winter guy is
I think he started it But I dont
know where he came from Theres a
place they hang out some of them --

Joey hesitates Theres something in him that clearly
doesnt want to tell

AMY
Joey
JOEY
Angel devil angel devil Fuck
AMY
Joey I know its dangerous I dont

JOEY

Yeah you see thats the problem
Youve got that fucked up
self-destructive thing going

AMY

JOEY
Angel devil angel devil
AMY
Joey Ive already seen things Im

already into it

JOEY

This is making me unhappy

(pause)
Avenue B and third street On the
northeast corner two doors down
theres a stairway going down into a
closed up building Its always
locked and theyre not always there
I don t know where they are when
theyre not And once you get mixed
up with them -- its like that story
with the fucking tar baby -- chances
are you never get loose and if you
do you never get clean

The Conductor shouts from somewhere

BLACK MAN
Coming in

Hands promptly reach up covering the windows with
newspaper The Black Man goes to the door

The band finishes its set as the light from the station
shines through the newspapers Joey looking drab in the
steady uneven light stares at Amy

JOEY
I cant take responsibility for you

AMY
Im not asking you to

JOEY
Amy Klein listen to Uncle Joey Im
doing a change of heart thing here --
dont do it Dont go any deeper
Forget about it Move away Change
your name Become somebody different

AMY
Come on I cant do that
JOEY
Okay Okay Then in that case I

dont want you to come back here any
more That way I can imagine that
you did change your mind You
understand

The one door hisses open Amy stares at Joey for a second
turns and departs back into the flourescent lit station

CUT TO
INT NIGHT THE SUBWAY PLATFORM

Amy stands on the platform as the door hisses shut The
train pulls away She checks her watch then moves to

the other side of the platform She looks down the tunnel
The light from an approaching train is beginning to reflect
off the curved wall of the tunnel

She looks away -- and then freezes
Something clicks

She turns back in the direction she just looked She
tugs off her sunglasses Far down the platform theres
a bench with a lone occupant - - a slumped over figure
dressed in a shiny green raincoat She turns toward it
staring In the distance no details of face or form are
visible -- just the lumpy figure in the shiny green
raincoat She takes a step toward it As she does we

CUT TO

A FLASHBACK

The same figure sitting on the bench in the previous
station

CUT TO
INT NIGHT THE TRAIN STATION

Amy keeps moving toward the figure The sound of the
approaching train grows louder

CUT TO
A FLASHBACK
Amy tugging open the closet in Marlas apartment -- the
green raincoat is there

CUT TO

INT NIGHT THE TRAIN STATION

Amy is closer now but still cannot make out any detail
in the slumped over figure She approaches as does
the train There is no sign of movement

She comes around closer to the edge of the platform to
get a more direct view of the green-coated form As she
does she sees that one hand is draped off the front edge
of the bench hanging limp The hand is gray

Amy takes a step forward

We see that the fingernails are painted green Then a
fly buzzes out from inside the sleeve of the rain coat
The fingers begin to curl

Amy gasps takes a step back -- and her heel lands on the
edge of the subway platform She struggles for balance

Abruptly a mans voice comes from somewhere

VOICE
Amy Klein

Amy stumbles forward goes down to her knees and turns
Around twenty feet behind her standing on the edge of
the platform with his back toward the drop is Winter
wearing a black trenchcoat cinched at the waist

He Looks down the tunnel Amy does as well The train
is coming into the station She turns back toward Winter

He stares at her with no particular expression then

spreads his arms as if about to dive looking like some
kind of sinister black bird --

And as the train comes flying in he calmly falls
backward directly into its path

Amy screams
In an instant shes up running alongside the braking
train The doors open but virtually nobody comes out
The front of the train is still far ahead
AMY
Hey You hit someone Someone fell

in front of the train Hey Hey

The doors hiss and start to close Finally Amy reaches

the front window of the train She hammers on it It
opens and a middle-aged WOMANS face leans out -- the
DRIVER
AMY
Somebody fell somebody fell in
front of the train
DRIVER
What
AMY

Didnt you see him

DRIVER
Where Where is he Whered he fall

AMY
Back there way back

She looks back in the direction from which shes come
The bench is now empty

DRIVER
Aw shit Aw shit
Amy though is now looking this way and that -- at the

confused faces of people peeking out through the doors of
the train There is no sign of a green plastic raincoat

CUT TO
EXT NIGHT THE STATION

Some time later The train is still there doors open
There are TRANSIT COPS on the station disgruntled
passengers hanging out on the platform TRACK WORKERS
are poking around underneath it

Amy is leaning against one of the metal pillars her
sunglasses back in place staring at the empty bench --
at the place where the mysterious figure was sitting
Shes looking grim

Behind her a Track Worker approaches the DRIVER whos
standing with a pair of Transit Cops Hes shaking his
head shrugging The Driver curses heads back toward
the first car One of the COPS approaches Amy

COP
Miss um Klein

AMY
Yeah

COP

Well the guys have looked

AMY
And theres nothing there

COP
You dont seem terribly surprised

AMY
Hmm

Theres a sudden hiss Amy turns as the train doors
close

COP
I mean you dont seem terribly
surprised that there isnt somebody
under the train

AMY
I dont know what to say I saw him

COP
Yeah Thats the thing Can you
tell me again just what it is that
you saw

AMY
Um I was standing on the platform

The train starts to move out of the station Amy looks
toward it

The train is moving on one of the center tracks so that
you can look through the windows of the cars and see
through them to the platform on the far side

AMY
--and um I saw this man standing
on the edge of the platform facing
away from it

But now Amy is seeing something -- through the windows of
the moving train On the platform on the far side there
are a pair of figures standing -- one dressed in a green
plastic rain coat -- the other in a black trenchcoat
Amy jumps looks more closely

COP
Did he say anyth

AMY
Its them

In an instant Amy is tearing down the platform heading
for the stairs that connect to the platform on the other
side

COP
Hey

Amy is watching staring through the moving train
windows The figures are still there Winter is staring
at her -- the face of the other figure is hidden beneath
the hood of the rain jacket

COP
Hey stop Marty Marty

In the next instant the Cop is giving chase and another
Cop clearly the Marty called by the first Cop
further down the station is rushing in to head Amy off

AMY
Its them Over there over there

In the next instant Marty tackles Amy and she goes down

on her face Her little black sunglasses go flying off

Even with the rather large Cop on top of her shes still
struggling

AMY
God damn it get off of me Get the
fuck off of me Get

She keeps struggling as the first Cop and the others on
the station converge on her She looks toward the far
platform

The two figures are still there visible through the
windows of the departing train Then the last car of
the train passes leaving an unencumbered view of the far
side

The platform is empty No sign of Winter No sign of
anybody in a green plastic raincoat

Amy stop struggling as the Cops tug her arms back
handcuffing her She hardly notices but keep staring at
the empty platform across the tracks She glances up at
the Cops

AMY
Where the Hell are my sunglasses

A panting Marty looks down at her

MARTY
Its fucking night you bint

CUT TO
INT DAY A POLICE STATION

Simultaneously dingy and glary its full of COPS and
UNHAPPY PEOPLE Amy sits slouched in a chair off against
a wall somewhere looking particularly pale -- but she

has managed to find her sunglasses She puffs aimlessly
on a cigarette She looks about without much interest --
a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN crying at a desk a young BLACK KID
holding a bloody rag to a cut on his neck -- WHORES
JUNKIES VICTIMS -- the usual users of Police Services
waiting to be processed through

A WOMAN COP passes in front of her

WOMAN COP
You cant smoke in here

Amy looks up at her as if tempted to answer back but
instead she takes the cigarette from her mouth and drops
it on the floor The Woman Cop moves off Amy watches
her as she departs

A shadow falls on Amy She hears a voice

BUD
(off screen)
Is this where the keep the cheaper
whores

Amy glances up at him without expression He looks down
at her

BUD
Christ youre lucky to have a boss
like me Once again I have saved your
small but relatively shapely behind

AMY
What were they going to charge me
with anyway

BUD
Charge you They were thinking of
shipping you to Bellevue -- you know
for observation But I managed to
convince them that you were merely
irresponsible You got your stuff

AMY
Yeah

BUD
Come on

Slowly feeling her bruises Amy gets up

CUT TO
INT DAY BUDS CAR
They drive in silence for a minute

AMY
Whyd you give me this story

BUD
Who else would have taken it Either
theyre going to think like Larry or
theyre going to be too afraid of it
But Amy Klein Tell me Amy Tell
me its real

AMY
Its real -- or Im crazy Ive not
sure which

- BUD
Well either way its a good story

AMY
Ive got leads Ill know in the end

BUD

You know Ame for the average person
hunger for knowledge is like hunger
for food We want to know just enough
to take the edge off our appetite
Then were satisfied and we stop

But you youre like a glutton

You cant help over-eating

AMY
I dont see you complaining

BUD

But you see thats the point Thats
why I need you Because all that
stuff I dont eat I still want

So I send you in to do the eating for
me and so I get to experience it
like by proxy but without actually
suffering and mental indigestion

AMY
Thats for me

BUD
Nobodys forcing anything down your
throat Correct

AMY
No

BUD

You see Ame you never grew up with
all this Catholic god and guilt stuff
It doesnt mean anything to you I
worry about god and heaven and hell
Not during the day you understand
but around three in the morning it
keeps me up I want to know whats
coming Whats up in heaven and down
in hell or even if theres nothing
Its useful when youre making plans

He turns the car toward the curb puts on the brake

BUD
So go find out And then well tell
the world
AMY

You know Bud theres something
vaguely demonic about you

BUD
Yeah so they say But did you know
the word demon comes from the Greek
word for knowledge As in
demonstrate

AMY
No I didnt know that

BUD
Fucking modern education

The car rolls to a stop

BUD
Door to door service Not too many
editors do this shit Now Amy go lie
down in your coffin until the hours of
daylight have passed as is your wont -
- then go get me my story

AMY
You know Larry called me last night
He was worried about me

BUD
Hes a sweet guy He wants to save
people Me I just take em as they
come And use them as they pass by

Amy gets out of the car heads up the steps She turns
watches as Buds car moves away then she hurries back
down the steps to the sidewalk below

CUT TO
EXT DAY AVENUE B AND THIRD STREET
A ragged run-down place looking bleak and ugly in the
bright light of day We see the street sign identifying

the place -- Avenue B and 3rd Street Amy is there
looking more than a little ragged and run-down herself

She crosses the street heading east on the uptown side
She passes one side door -- and then comes to a building
thats been sealed up -- doors and windows cemented shut

with cinderblocks

Beyond a narrow railing is a stairway pressed up

sideways against the building running down to a basement
entrance Amy looks down the stairway to its narrow
bottom Clearly a couple years worth of passers-by
having been using the space as a convenient garbage can --
the stairs and the bottom are littered with trash A
filthy mattress lies at the very bottom

Amy heads down
EXT DAY THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS

At the bottom of the stairs theres a wooden door A
holes been punched through it and a heavy padlocked
chain has been threaded through it and through a heavy
hasp thats been bolted to the door frame Some official
government notice of some kind has been tacked to the
door -- long rendered unreadable by the effects of time

Amy inspects the padlock Its heavy and uncompromising
She tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the
chain -- but thats only a few inches Amy peers into
the darkness beyond but cant see a thing

She stares at the door -- an insolubly solid puzzle She
looks down at the mattress that shes standing on steps
to the side and shoves it up revealing the concrete
floor beneath

There are scratch marks on the ground like a wide fan
marking the path that the door sweeps when it opens
outward And the marks are recent
Then as if the light breaks she reaches out grabs the
hasp and pulls The bolts holding the hasp to the wall
are loose They slide out with it She tugs the whole
thing free and pulls the door open
There is a narrow corridor beyond all in gloom
Amy enters

CUT TO
INT DAY THE CORRIDOR

Amy steps in her way illuminated only by the indefinite
light that leaks in from the street

She slips off her sunglasses and moves down the corridor
Theres an archway presumably leading into the rest of
the basement on one side but its blocked by a great
heap of rubble -- the detritus of some renovation that
was never finished

Amy ponders the chances of getting through it and
decides to check out the rest of the hallway It doesnt
take long

There is only a single door left -- at the far end of the
hallway It hangs half-open but we cannot see whats
inside She approaches it reaches out and pushes the
door open Its a bathroom

INT DAY THE BATHROOM

This is one of those nasty little makeshift places built
into an available corner -- basically a toilet and a sink
so close that theres hardly room to move A mop and
some other supplies long forgotten long decayed are
propped up in a corner

Amy steps in looks down the toilet Nothing left but
some nasty stains -- the water long dried up Her face
brushes against something hanging in the air She pulls
back Its a pull string hanging from a naked light bulb

She tugs on it Nothing No power here

She stands in the dark claustrophobic place puzzled

She looks back down the hall It seems as if shes come
to another dead end Then she stares at the bathroom
door Open now it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall --
the only place she hasnt looked

Amy steps back virtually straddling the toilet and pushes
the door closed As she does of course what little

light there is vanishes completely If theres something
behind the door she cant see it or anything else

Abruptly theres a sharp click as she lights her lighter
and the wavery light illuminates the tiny bathroom -- and
the previously unseen space behind the door

The walls do not meet there There is a narrow gap
leading to a passage apparently between the walls
perhaps ten inches wide

Hesitating only a moment Amy turns sideways and slides
herself into the claustrophobic slot

She holds the lighter up ahead of her but its dim
flickery light does not reach to the end of the passage
She moves forward cautiously -- the floor is littered
with dried chunks of plaster rotting insulation --
seventy-five years of stuff crumbled from the insides of
the walls

She reaches a vertical pipe up against one side of the
wall - - only a few inches thick but it reduces the
available room to under eight inches She hesitates
Meanwhile the lighter in her hand is getting hot She
lets it click off In some dim half-light we can see her
slipping a handkerchief carefully around it for
insulation

She flicks the flint The lighter lights

And abruptly around a million roaches which had returned
from their hiding places in the absence of the light go
skittering every which way

Amy lets out a squeak as the roaches vanish in an instant

AMY
Christ

She looks at the pipe again and then starts to squeeze
past it Its a tight fit She has to squirm to get
through

AMY
-Headquarters of the fucking Kate
Moss cult

She pops free and comes out the other side She holds up
the lighter Still the light cannot reach to the end of
the passage Steeling herself she moves on But as she
does the space seems to get progressively narrower and
narrower

From ten inches to nine to eight until both sides of
her body are scraping against the walls She holds the
Lighter out The wall continues to narrow

At the end of her outstretched arm the walls are only
around five inches apart

AMY
Shit

Clearly shes reached the end of the line Annoyed she
starts to back out -- then realizes that the light on the
far side of her body renders the area into which shes
now moving essentially black as midnight

She brings the hand holding the lighter close in to her
body but she cant bring her hands together in front of
her -- the space is too narrow Finally she reaches her
hand up over her head passing the lighter from one hand
to the other directly over her head

As she does the lighter almost slips She grabs for it
but it goes out Again she is lost in virtual darkness

She strikes the flint The light returns -- now
illuminating the other side of her body -- the way from
which shes come Once again the roaches go skittering
away

She starts moving -- but something is seriously wrong
The way back isnt widening Its narrowing She moves
forward tries to squeeze through She cant move any
further

She holds up the lighter The walls on this side now
also continue to narrow The space revealed by the light
is barely as wide as her fist and there is only darkness
beyond

AMY
What the fuck

Amy stands simply unable to comprehend this She looks
back could she have somehow gotten turned around
Confused about the direction

She starts back the way she came but now she can barely
move a few feet before the wall becomes too narrow to
pass She pushes trying to shove through the narrow

gap But she cannot move

She tries pulling back but now she cant move that way
either in some impossible fashion the walls have literally
closed in until she is now literally pinned between them

Gasping Amy pushes against the wall shes facing

AMY
What the hell is this Christ

Of course the wall doesnt budge Its solid as a wall
Amy starts struggling panic growing on her trying to
climb to crouch to tug free in some direction but she
is absolutely pinned

She is struggling to breathe against the pressing walls

AMY
Stop this Stop this fucking thing

Shes flailing her arms now frantic The light goes out
and once again shes plunged into virtual darkness One
of her hands flies back and hits the wall behind her

It clunks hollow as if shes hit a hollow-core door
Breathing fast she strikes it again hearing the hollow
sound

She reaches back with her empty hand feeling at the
wall her hand reaches something like the sharply
defined edge of a sliding door She tugs at it it
doesnt move

Gasping she slides her hand across the expanse of smooth
wood until her fingers brush against a metal slot
She slides her fingers into it and pulls awkwardly

It slides over into the wall and she jams herself over
and swings around now facing into a great empty space

She stands in silence breathing fast She cant see a
thing After a moment with a trembling hand she lifts
the lighter and flicks it

The light comes on

She is standing in a familiar room -- the room on the
video tape the room where Sheila blew her brains out

And its not empty

In fact its full of PEOPLE -- the same people who we saw
in the tape They have been sitting in the dark and the
light from the lighter now illuminates them shines in
their eyes

They are all staring at Amy
Clearly they have been staring at her in the dark She

gasps but holds her ground Nobody says anything or
approaches She looks to one side

Carl is there much as he was in the video tape -- or is
he Theres something about his face that isnt quite
right Amy stares

He blinks And then it is clear His eyes are too large
Not hugely but perhaps twenty-five percent larger than
they were -- and certainly larger than they should be

She turns the other way A girl in the corner who was
apparently looking away is now turning back toward her
As she does it is clear that something strange is
happening It almost seems as if Amy is witnessing the
very tail end of some tranformation back to human that
the girls face WAS something else something stretched
out and doughy But as the girl turns full around her
features seem to knit together and we recognize her as
Marybeth

She stares at Amy

Amy is about to speak and then suddenly realizes that
theres somebody behind her Its a big BLACK KID around
nineteen He puts a hand on her shoulder Amy gasps

but it isnt a threatening gesture

BLACK KID
Go on and see Winter Hes through
there

Amy tries to speak but her throat is too dry She nods
to the Black Kid and heads for the door he pointed to

The others move away as she passes but keep close
distinctly inside her personal space She finds herself
coming close to a rather cute BLONDE GIRL At any rate
shed be cute if her smile wasnt duplicated by a bloodless
slash that bisects her throat like a hideous toothless
second mouth She walks on past and goes to the door

She hesitates about to knock then changes her mind and
simply opens the door

INT DAY WINTERS ROOM

This is a small dark space light coming mostly froma
rather conventional-looking standing lamp Winter is
there sitting in a padded chair in front of a coffee
table reading a book Amy steps inside Winter doesnt
react to her presence Abruptly the door closes behind
her She hesitates and walks forward

AMY
Winter

He glances up at her but doesnt speak Amy pauses
unsure then moves forward and takes a seat opposite him

AMY
Thats one hell of a way in Makes
me thing that you dont

WINTER

(cutting her off)
People come in here the way they want
If it was hard that was the way you
wanted it A little mystery A little
danger A little magical rite of
passage thrown in Thats what you
expected Thats what you found

Amy leans forward

AMY

I know about you Winter
WINTER

Do you
AMY

I want to join you

WINTER

Really So Amy Klein wants to join us
Should we be honored Or do you think
you can just go along with us fora
little ride and then get off when it
suits you like with your friends on
the train Youre not going to find it
so easy to get off of this train

AMY

So I shouldnt get on
WINTER

Youre already on it
AMY

Tell me Is it real
WINTER

No
AMY

All of this the tape what happened
in Marlas apartment what you did
falling in front of the train All
tricks Hypnosis

WINTER
No Not tricks Not hypnosis Just
not real

AMY
I dont understand

WINTER
I cant help you Im not what you
think Not a guru Not a shaman
Not the fearless leader I only
know one thing and that thing I
cant teach you

AMY
Who can

WINTER
Listen to me Amy Klein None of
what Im going to tell you is real
But it may help you if you imagine
that it is

AMY
Okay

WINTER
There are things that are true in the
light of day There are other things
that are no less true that live in
the shadows When you shine a light
on them they disappear They stop
being true Thats because it is the
uncertainty of the dark that makes
them possible If the dark is deep
enough anything might be happening
in it Anything at all

AMY
Why did Marla commit suicide

WINTER
Marla cant commit suicide All she
can do is stop believing that shes
alive And she cant even do that
The more she doubts the the deader
she becomes But she cant really
die because shes not really alive
Shes not really anything at all

Not real

AMY
not real Like what Sheila

said on the tape That she wasnt

real

WINTER

Thats right

What the

AMY
hell does that mean

WINTER

Thats the thing that I cant teach

you

AMY

Thats bull What I saw in that
apartment was real What I smelled

was real

Real like this table

Real like like this hand

She raps on the table Winter leans forward and grabs

her by the wrist

Amy hisses -- the grip is hard

WINTER

Please dont raise your voice to me
I dont like being yelled at

AMY

Im sorry

Winter still holding Amys hand by the wrist reaches
forward with his other hand and uncurls Amys fingers

WINTER

You say this is real

He begins to move
the various parts

his fingers over her hand enumerating

WINTER

Epidermis The dorsal faschia Palmal

fashia

Heres the adductor pollicis

The Opponens Pollicis Median nerve
runs here Ulnar nerve through here

Proximal

palmar vessels Vincula longa

and breva Transverse carpal ligament
across here

The process is taking on an oddly seductive quality

WINTER
The median nerve underneath it The
bones First Distal Falange here

Second middle Falange Third Proximal
Falange Down here the fourth
metacarpal Down here the carpal
bones And do you think that all
those parts are what makes a hand
Ill show you what makes a hand
here

He begins to move his fingers through the spaces in between
her fingers

WINTER

These spaces That what makes a hand
You get it by taking things away You
Amy Klein are the infinitesimal speck
thats left when we take subtract the
infinet possibilities that the space
you occupy might might have held

(refering to her hand)
This thing here isnt a presence Its
an absence Its a place where things
are missing In all essential qualities
it is less than nothing In all
essential qualities you are less than
nothing Not solid not here not real

Amy tries to disengage her hand but he isnt letting go

AMY
And what about you

WINTER
Not real Not me not this hand not
this table The world has decided
that tables are to be a certain thing
and because it has they are But
if the dark is deep enough the hand
the table the flesh they can all
come free

She tries to pull even harder but he holds her with no
effort at all

WINTER
Listen to me Amy Klein Youre on the
train whether you want to be or not
And I cant be your guide Youve
chosen your guide -- the one who first
took you into the night

(MORE )

WINTER (CONTD)
Shes the only one who can show you the
way who can show you what you have to
do But thats a problem as I said
Because shes no longer sure herself
and she may already be beyond saving

And if shes lost youre lost
AMY

Like Bobby
WINTER

Thats right Like Bobby whom you
know nothing about and like a lot of
others Nobody ever said enlightenment
was easy Theyre still around but
its hard to find them because even
they cant decide where they or even
what they are Maybe thats how youll
end up hanging forever by a bootlace
in a toilet wanting to be dead but
not quite able to pull it off

AMY
Let go of my hand

He doesnt move She yanks again hard but he still
wont release her Finally she hauls off and slaps him
across the face This also doesnt seem to phase him

WINTER
Dont think for a second Amy Klein
that you are not in danger You are
in more danger than you ever imagined
possible To be beaten or tortured
or raped or killed You think this
table is solid

Be slaps her hand down on the table She winces

She doesnt answer

again

WINTER
Do you

WINTER
Do you

AMY
Yes

WINTER

Are you afraid Amy Klein

He slaps her hand down on the table

AMY
Yes
WINTER
Good because fear is the place we go
to learn

He lifts her hand up and folds it so that her index and
middle finger are sticking straight out and the other
fingers are folded back in a fist He casually turns her
hand so that the two fingers are pointed down at the
table

WINTER
Close your eyes

AMY
Why

WINTER

Close your eyes

Amy hesitates then closes them Winter begins to move
her hand down

WINTER
Im moving your hand down Youre
going to feel something wet There
Do you feel it

We dont see what Amys hand is touching but we hear a
kind of wet sticky sound

AMY
Yes

WINTER
What does it feel like

AMY
I dont know Like a mouth It
feels like something sucking on my
fingers

WINTER

Open your eyes

Amy opens her eyes Winter takes his hand away revealing
the table beneath Amy gasps in horror The face of a
baby has somehow grown out of the table and its tiny
mouth is now sucking on her fingers She pulls away
trying to get her fingers free

AMY
Christ

Winter abruptly leans forward and shoves the table over
Amy falls to the floor and the table lands on its side

As it does it start to undergo a bizarre transformation
The legs of the table start curling around becoming soft
whitish pink Tiny fingers blossom from one set of table
legs tiny baby feet from the other The whole thing is
shrinking changing shape And the babys face is changing
too literally growing older Amy cries out as she
finds her fingers clenched between baby teeth She shoves
her hand against the face trying to pull free to drag
herself away The table continues its weird
transformation shrinking thickening The arms and legs
grow closer to their natural thickness The whole thing
is also clearly aging at a marked rate The face now
has a crown of black hair and appears to be around twelve
years old

AMY
Make her let go of me

WINTER
Learn a lesson Amy Klein There are
no games played here

AMY
I believe you

WINTER
Not yet

Amy stares at the weird twisting object in front of her
The arms and legs are approaching human form the lower
side of the table thickening into a womans hips the
bare legs swelling out from them The V of pubic hair
blossoms out and breasts form as the body of the table
collapses into the form of a womans torso lying
lengthwise on the floor an its side Finally the
transformation is complete and Amy finds her fingers
clamped tight in the mouth of Sheila -- the girl whom she
saw die and be reborn on the tape Sheila stark naked
and clearly in some feral state abruptly springs up and
throws herself on top of Amy -- still clenching her fingers
in her teeth

WINTER
Close your eyes Amy Klein

AMY
Get her off of me
(to Sheila)
Get off of me

WINTER
Close your eyes

AMY
Get the fuck off

Amy gasps as Sheila bites down hard Finally Amy takes
a deep breath and then thrusts her thumb into one of
Sheilas eyes It slides right in -- but not into flesh
and eye Instead it seems to sink into the stuff the
girls face as if the face were made of clay

WINTER
You cant hurt her Shes one of us

Abruptly Winter springs forward literally leaping tiger-
like across the intervening distance Lie comes slamming
down on top of the two and as he comes down for an
instant it seems as if hes landing not on his hands but
on the front limbs of a white tiger his face drawn back
cat-like In an instant he leans forward and all traces
of the beast vanish

WINTER
Close your eyes

But Amy is in the midst of a full-fledged panic and isnt
about to do anything Winter turns looking back toward
the light stand by his chair He swipes his hand back
behind him as if to knock the thing over even though
its a good ten feet away from him

It doesnt fall over Rather the upper portion of the
lamp quite simply vanishes as if literally erased by the
sweep of his hand

The room plunges into almost complete darkness Winter
reaches back and tears Sheila off flinging her away

With a cat-like squeal she literally goes flying off
into the darkness -- dwindling into a dark cluttered
distance despite the wall that should have stopped her
Winter turns toward Amy whos still struggling

WINTER
Close your eyes

AMY
No no

Winter reaches down and clamps his hand across her eyes
then picks her up and flings her

CUT TO
SOMEPLACE ELSE INT NIGHT

Abruptly she hits a vertical plain of safety glass It
bursts into a thousand tiny fragments and she goes
crashing back through it

Her head hits hard against a tile wall and she goes sliding
down in the dark her hand scrambling for something to
hold onto

Her reaching hand grabs some metal handle She pulls
and abruptly water begins to cascade down onto her face

She turns herself sideways and rolls over gasping Shes
in a bathtub in fact shes just been thrown through

the safety-glass door She scrambles over the bottom

edge of the sliding glass door scraping herself across
the tiny pegs of glass that still line the border of the
frame

She pulls herself up her hand feeling for a light
switch Finally she finds it flips the switch

Shes in a bathroom -- in fact shes in her bathroom
slumped over against the sink Soaking wet scratched
shaking gasping she stares at herself in the mirror

Theres a tiny square of glass stuck into her shoulder
She tugs it loose It clinks as she drops it into the
sink

AMY
Its not real its not real

She lifts her hand to wipe the wet hair from her face

then pauses She stares at her fingers No sign of a

bite mark Drained she turns toward the bathtub She

reaches through the shattered door and turns off the shower
CUT TO

INT NIGHT AMYS APARTMENT

Shes scrunched down in her chair the little telephone
headset on her head Shes punching in a number

She hits dial We can hear the phone ringing on the
other side for a long time Finally somebody answers
We hear a WOMANs voice sleep-blurry

WOMAN
(off screen)
Yeah hello

AMY
Is Larry there

WOMAN
(off screen)
Hmm Oh hold on

Theres a sound of motion some voices the words of which
we cannot understand Then a clunk as the receiver on

the other end is picked up again Larrys voice blurry
with sleep comes on the line

LARRY
(off screen)
Yeah hello

AMY
Larry

LARRY
(off screen)

AMY

AMY

LARRY
(off screen)

Amy feels something reaches a hand up to the pocket of
her jacket She reaches inside

AMY
No

She tugs out her sun glasses Theyve been shattered

AMY
Im just a little fucked in the
head Im going to get some sleep

LARRY
(off screen)
Yeah okay Thats a good idea
Ill see you tomorrow

AMY
Yeah Maybe not tomorrow

LARRY
(off screen)

Amys attention is focused on the broken sunglasses
Suddenly she remembers That shes on the phone

AMY
Hey Larry did you know that the
word demon comes from the Greek
word for knowledge

LARRY
(off screen)
Um yeah Yeah I guess I did know
that

AMY
Well I wish somebody had fucking
told me about it

LARRY
(off screen)
Right Look Amy just take it slow
Okay

AMY
Right Right Okay Bye

She hangs up then tosses the remnants of the broken
sunglasses into a wastebasket She tugs the headset off

CUT TO

NIGHT AMYS APARTMENT

The room is dark drained of all color the way things
appear when we see in them in almost total darkness
Amys lying in bed -- actually just a mattress on the
floor -- on her stomach The sheet has crumpled off of
her Shes dressed only in her panties

Her pale naked skin is visible in the dim monochromatic
light marked with scratches and bruises

We are MOVING toward her seeing her as if from the POV
of someone approaching her coming down toward the pale
vulnerable expanse of her naked back

We come in CLOSE on Amys head and shoulders Abruptly
a fly buzzes down brushes her face She doesnt wake

Abruptly theres the sound of a wettish thud and Amy
seems to bounce a little Her eyes open but she isnt
alarmed Still lying on her back she flicks her eyes
this way and that but seeing nothing she closes them
again

A few seconds later we see some black liquid trickle
across her shoulder coming from the unseen center of her
back It follows a course down her backbone then swerves
and finds a path along the inner edge of one of her
shoulder blades finally trickling down her neck It
continues to flow staining the pillow by her face

She stirs slightly clearly feeling the trickle She
puts her hand to her shoulder smearing the black liquid

Still half-asleep she tries to brush it off but it
continues to flow Finally her eyes open She sits up
painfully and looks at her hands -- stained with this

sticky black stuff She stares at it not quite awake
enough to figure it out

She reaches over her shoulder pulls her hand back stained
with the black stuff She looks down at her pillow also
stained Confused she rises painfully awkward and

heads toward the bathroom We can see that her feet leave
blackish wet footprints across the floor as she moves
toward the bathroom

She moves in stares in the mirror -- sees the side of
her face and her shoulder smeared with black She fumbles
for the light flips it on

In the sudden shocking glare of returning light COLOR
abruptly re-enters the world

And the black of the liquid thats stained Amys face and
hands that track the floor of the white-tiled bathroom
that smear the wall where she flipped on the light switch
turns instantly to its true color --

The color of blood

Amy gasps at the sight -- she looks like shes just
crawled out of a slaughterhouse She reaches behind her
feeling her back trying to find the source of the blood
that seems to be pouring out of her dripping to the
floor pouring down the small of her back staining the
back of her panties a vivid ghastly red

In a sudden impulse she turns on the water in the sink
full blast washes away the blood from her hands
scooping handfuls onto her face and the front of her
body The water drips to the floor commingling with the
blood turning it a nasty pink

She reaches behind her back feeling again -- her hand
comes back as vividly red as before Again she washes
them She stops dead seeing something in the mirror

Something is glinting between her breasts She touches
her finger to it It looks like a tiny bit of gleaming
metal poking out from inside of her almost like a tiny
steel splinter It appears to have just barely broken
through the skin from inside -- barely a drop of blood

She stands staring down at it breathing fast What the
hell is it

Then slowly almost against her will she turns her back
to the mirror and looks over her shoulder She sees --
and we see for the first time -- the center of her back
where her questing hands couldnt reach

There is a knife there literally thrust through the
middle of her back The gleaming splinter between her
breasts is the tip of the knife that has literally
transfixed her -- and clearly transfixed the center of
her chest -- her heart

She strains her hands back trying to reach this impossible
thing but her grasping fingers cant touch it She turns
back toward the mirror staring into her own eyes

AMY
Its not real its not real

She clenches her eyes opens them Her fingers feel
desperately for the metal tip between her breasts Its
still there

AMY
Wake up wake-up wake up

She starts slapping her hands against the side of her
face -- not gently hard slaps But she isnt waking

up She grabs her hair pulls hard Nothing Shes still
there The knife is still stuck impossibly in her back

She sits on the closed seat of the toilet not knowing
what to do She reaches again for the knife but she
cant touch it She buries her face in her bloody hands

AMY
Im dreaming Im fucking dreaming
Im fucking dreaming

She stands turns this way and that not knowing what to
do She looks around her bathroom searching for
something She tugs open the medicine cabinet searches
beneath the sink tugging the various stuff out Whatever
it is that shes looking for she cant find it

She goes tearing out of the bathroom scrambles across
the dim landscape of her apartment into the narrow
kitchen

She yanks open the silverware drawer and starts digging
through it Not finding what she wants she goes to
another drawer full of junk with various unused serving
pieces mined in

Finally she comes up with what shes searching for -- a
foot-long skewer -- a two-tined metal thing -- the kind
of thing that might be used for holding a turkey while
being carved

She races back to the bathroom turns toward the mirror
and reaches back with the skewer Clearly we understand
now what she wanted the skewer for -- to lever the knife
out of the middle of her back

Using the reverse-image in the mirror as a guide she
reaches down the skewer drifting this way and that as
she tries to get it into position She slips the two
tines over the narrow handle of the knife tugs back
The skewer slides loose The knife stays where it is
Amy gasps and again struggles trembling hand to catch
the knife handle on the tines of the skewer She finally
slips it back into position

She twists the skewer hoping that torque will hold it in
place on the slick handle With a groan she pulls back
and the knife begins to move

We can see the tiny silver tip between her breasts vanish
from view drawn back inside her body Slowly making a
wet sticky sound the long thin knife begins to slide
out

With an couple inches of the blade now exposed she slides
the skewer down locks it against the blade behind the
handle -- a better lever With a gasp she heaves out
and the knife goes flying It bounces on the floor
splattering blood With shaking hands Amy bends over

and picks it up She stands staring at it Its some
kind of nasty stiletto Amy stands staring at it

A FLASHBACK

Amy searching Marlas drawers tugging one open -- pressing
the stud on a stiletto On this stiletto

INT NIGHT AMYS APARTMENT

She looks down toward the floor She is literally standing
in a pool of her own blood She gasps turns back toward
the mirror

Blood is pouring from the wound Gasping almost crying
Amy stumbles back into the main room With shaky hands
she moves to open the lid on her lap top then realizes
that shes still holding the stiletto in her hand She
drops it on the table tugs the headset over her head
Her bloody fingers press in the numbers -- 9-1-1

She waits standing in the middle of her dark apartment
shaking bloody She can hear the phone ring and ring

Finally theres a click as the line picks up But theres
no voice on the other end

AMY
Hello hello Hello Is there anyb

Then she stops dead There is somebody there and making
a sound weve heard before The nasty gurgling that Amy
heard when she tried calling Marlas place

She stands listening trembling And then suddenly
the sound of the gurgling changes

Suddenly it no longer is distorted by the phone line
It seems to be close -- real

Amy turns slowly around -- toward the open door of her
bathroom

She looks Only now it isnt her bathroom on the far
side of the door Its Marlas bathroom And Marla is
there hanging as before but not quite as before
because her eyes are staring at Amy Her lips move and
the ghastly noise comes out

Then Marla raises her hand toward Amy and gestures -- a
gesture for her to come In a sudden impulse Amy lifts
her laptop and flings it toward the image in the
bathroom It arcs through the air and abruptly strikes
something hard

The vision of Marla abruptly shatters and vanishes Amys
bathroom abruptly reappears The lap top has hit the
mirror in the open medicine cabinet door smashing it

The cabinet door flies back to the wall and rebounds
floating back into view

We see Amy reflected in the shards as she approaches
She stares into the shattered mirror and realizes
suddenly that more than her image is being reflected
Some of the bits of glass are reflecting another form --
Marlas

AMY
What do you want What the hell do
you want

And then in the shards she can see the image of Marlas
dead swollen fingers -- gesturing Gesturing for her to
come

Amy stands frozen for a minute her blood dripping on
the floor her breath coming in ragged gasps Then she
turns and moves

A MOMENT LATER
We see her rolling a towel up into a tight cylinder

Hands trembling she lays it across a wide strip of duct
tape that shes unwound from a roll and laid down on the
table sticky side up She presses the towel down so
that it sticks then picks up the tape with towel
attached She slides the towel down the center of her
back until it covers the wound and then tugs the tape
tight across her chest compressing the towel against the
wound She takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around
the towel and herself a couple more times finally biting
through the tape and tossing the roll away

She yanks yesterdays clothes up discards the skirt in
favor of a pair of black jeans She tugs them up over
her bloody legs pulls a black shirt on over her top
thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy shoes and
finally tugs on a black leather jacket She goes to the
mirror turns trying to see how her profile looks with
the towel stuffed in her back -- but in the shattered
glass she cant really tell

She turns about to leave then realizes that her hands
are red with her own blood She hurries to the sink
rinses them off and rinses the blood off of her face and
neck then grabs her bag and heads for the door

Once again she stops She goes back grabs the stiletto
presses the stud and lets the blade Slide back down and
stuffs it into the pocket of her jacket She heads out
the door

CUT TO
INT NIGHT THE TRAIN

Amy is huddled in a corner seat looking miserable
scared and slightly guilty She looks down the length
of the subway car

There are a few scattered riders -- a group of BLACK KIDS
at the far end of the train a uniformed GUARD either on
his way to work or on his way home A post-punk COUPLE
looking dull and heroin-pale None of them look at her

Amy hugs herself across the chest looking as if shes
about to cry Finally she looks up as the train pulls
into a station

The doors open and an OLD MAN comes through the door as
Amy rises from her seat and heads out The Old Man looks
toward the seat recently vacated by Amy

OLD MAN
Hey

Amy turns and looks back The seat and the floor beneath
it is stained with blood Amy hesitates for only a second
then turns and hurries out through the subway door just
before it closes

CUT TO
EXT NIGHT THE STREET

Amy is leaving bloody footprints as she walks but there
is nobody on the street now to notice

EXT NIGHT THE FRONT OF MARLAS BUILDING

Amy climbs the stairs checks the buzzers Theres
Marlas name It hasnt been removed She lifts her
finger to press the button Before she touches it a
prolonged buzz sounds She turns toward the door and
shoves it open

CUT TO
INT NIGHT THE HALLWAY OF MARLAS APARTMENT

We see Amy moving up the stairs turning the corner and
heading down toward Marlas apartment The lock on the
door is still broken Yellow police tape has been taped
across it She tears the tape away shoves the door open
and enters

MARLA S APARTMENT

She comes in closing the door behind her and flips on
the light switch It doesnt go on Power is dead She
moves in to the apartment Lights from the city beyond
the window provides some marginal illumination It is
essentially the same as she saw it the first time --
except that the windows are now open and standing fans
have been placed there now no longer spinning --
presumably to remove the smell

Amy then turns and heads down the corridor She turns
the corner The corridor is completely dark If there
is something in the bathroom at the far end it isnt
visible Amy moves fast down the corridor to the
bathroom

It is empty The cord is still there tied to the pipe
but its been cut

Then in the silence theres a noise -- a brief sound of
movement Amy turns toward the bedroom She steps in

INT NIGHT THE BEDROOM

The bed is there visible in the indefinite light empty
But something is different The quilted bedcover is
missing Amys eyes move left and right No sign of
motion

Then slowly she moves to the other side of the bed -- to
the three-foot space between the bed and the far wall

The quilted bedcover is piled up in the far corner between
the bed and the wall

But something isnt quite right It looks a bit too full
somehow Amy stares at it then slips the stiletto out
of her pocket

She presses the stud The blade snicks out

Then slowly the bedcover begins to move Something

tugs it downward from within and it slips down revealing
Marlas eyes peeking child-like over the top Shes
still apparently wearing the green plastic rain coat

If anything the effects of decay seem to have advances
There are ulcerations around her eyes Her skin is
turning dark

AMY
What the fuck did you do to me

She brandishes the blade

AMY
What

Marla lowers the bedcover revealing her face and neck
Ulcerations are also growing around her mouth The cord
is still tied around her neck She reaches a hand out
from under the cover scratches at it We can see from
the marks on her throat that shes been trying to get it
loose without success She reaches a hand out toward
Amy Amy hesitates then moves forward Marla lifts her
head revealing her throat The cord is virtually buried
there

AMY
No no no bend your head down

Marla bends her head down Amy reaches out and brushes
her hair out of the way revealing the cut-loose end of
the cord She tugs it up and slides the edge of the knife
between the knot and Marlas swollen neck As she works
it in some nasty fluid begins to seep out of the sodden
flesh She recoils at the smell

Finally Amy flicks the blade to the side cutting through
the cord Marla draws in a great ragged gasp But the
cord still sticks and Amy must draw it slowly back out
of the flesh of Marla s neck She tosses the cord away

MARLA
(mumbling)
Im sorry

AMY
What

Marla looks up at her

MARLA
I said Im sorry

AMY
Youre sorry
(almost laughing)
What the fuck is that Im bleeding
all over fucking lower Manhattan It
was you wasnt it It was you who
did this

MARLA
Its the way its supposed to work
The one who initiates you is the one
who has to be your guide

AMY
This is the initiation Stabbing
somebody in the back

MARLA
No please help me up

She reaches out a swollen hand Amy hesitates then
reaches out and grabs it tugging Marla up out of the
corner She doesnt quite make it all the way up but
slumps instead across the bed

MARLA
Thats the way its supposed to work
First the guide does it -- to make it
easier for you to believe Then you
do it to yourself Im sorry Im
the wrong person to be explaining
this I just thought if I could

help you maybe I could help myself

AMY
Help me You stabbed me Im
bleeding Im bleeding to death

Marla pulls herself up Amy for a moment goes to help
her then decides against it She steps back as Marla
turns and sits herself on the bed

MAMA
Dont think that way That gets you
into trouble Witness witness me

AMY
Theres a hole in my back My feet
make squishy sounds when I walk because
my shoes are full of blood

MARLA
That doesnt matter
AMY
What the fuck do you mean it doesnt
matter
MARLA
Could you get me a glass of water
AMY
Listen Let me make this clear I

AM BLEEDING TO DEATH

MARLA
Could you get me a glass of water

Amy hesitates then rushes out goes into the bathroom
Marla sits relatively placid while Amy fills a glass
and comes back Marla takes it lifts it to her lips
slowly drinks She lowers the glass to the bed lets it
tip over onto its side

MARLA
We shouldnt stay here
AMY
I cant leave like this Im trailing

blood wherever I go Somebodys going
to see Somebodys going to stop us

Us how can you go anywhere
MARLA

Where were going that doesnt matter
AMY

Where
MARLA

You have to tell me You know the
way Now Go on We cant stay
here forever This isnt a stable
situation

AMY
Its not stable

MARLA
Weve got to go This place is too
solid We cant hold on to it Ive
been drifting in and out all night
Im only here now because you want me
to be Please

AMY
But I dont know

MARLA
Help me and Ill help you But weve
got to go

Abruptly theres a sound like something cracking Amy
turns toward the window Outside she can see the night
lights of the city -- but something strange has happened
Theres a crack in the window but NOT in the glass

It appears as if the world outside in fact has cracked
and through the crack the same city is visible but a
city bright as noon A brilliant sliver of daylight is
pouring through the crack and it cuts across the bed
like a knife

Marla jumps up and pulls away from the light

AMY
What is it

MARLA
Were losing it

She scrambles toward the bedroom door pressing herself
up against the wall Theres another sound of cracking
and then more coming from the other room

Marla makes no move Amy finally gets up and hurries
past her

INT THE LIVING ROOM

Amy comes around the corner and then freezes The same
weird sight presents itself The night world outside the
windows appears to be shattering letting in splinters of
a daylit version of the city beyond

But something even stranger appears to be happening
because as the shafts of light cut diagonally across the
dark room they appear to be illuminating sharp slices of
HUMAN FIGURES that are simply NOT THERE in the adjoining
shadows Another crack appears and another shaft of
light cuts across the room

The shard of light flickers through the spinning blades
of the fan -- but the Night fan -- clearly visible
surrounding it -- isnt spinning It is only the

daylight version that appears to be in motion

As the cracks grow the floating shards of figures begin
to assemble into something recognizable Theres the
FIGURE of a POLICEMAN -- or at any rate we can glimpse
a slice of his uniform afloat in the air another slice
a bit lower shows his hands holding a notebook writing
something in it Near him we see slices of a second
figure hovering in the shafts of light -- a black man

We begin to hear dull echoes of voices and we recognize
one of them -- the black man in fact is the Super who
let Amy in

Another crack in the world beyond the window cuts a thin
shaft across his face We hear his words dully

SUPER
(muted )
Im a religious man you know

We see the disconnected sections of the Policeman turn
his gesturing hand drifting in and out of View as it
moves in and out of the light that defines the borders of
its visible existence His voice too comes out muted
and incomplete

POLICEMAN
(muted )
Look did tually see a bod

Amy continues to stare mesmerized by this strange
phenomenon She doesnt notice as Marla comes up
tentatively up behind her She stands a few feet behind
Amy who fails to notice her

Finally she reaches out a finger and taps her shoulder
Amy jumps turns

MARLA
We have to go we have to go
AMY

Whats happening

MARLA
Our thing only sticks in the shadows
In the dark You dont understand that
yet and I cant hold onto it
its a my situation

AMY
What happens if we stay

MARLA
In their world in the daylight a
knife in the heart is fatal If you
stay if you get sucked up in that
world then youll have to live by
their rules The rules that make you
dead

Amy turns on her angrily
AMY

Then why are you so anxious to leave --
if what you want is to be dead

MARLA
Because theres no version of me that
makes sense in their world any more I

cant fit back in What do you think I
was trying to do Please Weve got
to go

Behind them the cracks in the night are growing
filling the room with pools of painfully bright radiance

Amy looks down toward the floor She can see her own
bloody footprints in the shadows there As she looks
another crack spills a bright slash of daylight across
the floor -- and in the light of day her bloody
footprints are simply not there

Another crack of light cuts across the floor cutting one
of the footprints neatly in half -- visible in the
shadow gone in the light

AMY
Go how Whats outside the door
Day or night Where do we go

MARLA
You have to decide

Amy looks around the apartment as if deciding what to
do

AMY
(pause)
Its the bathroom isnt it

Marla doesnt answer Amy turns and heads out of the
bedroom She looks back toward Marla

AMY
Come on

They turn and hurry toward the bathroom
INT NIGHT THE BATHROOM

The two enter the dark space Amy backs away as Marla
enters coming unpleasantly close to her She hesitates
then closes the door Behind it set into the wail there
is a narrow archway -- leading to a flight of scuffed
black steps leading down into gloom

AMY
Where does this lead

MARLA
I dont know Ive never seen it
before

AMY
Go on youre the guide You go on
first

Marla starts toward the arch Abruptly a crack forms
in the narrow bathroom window sending a shard of light
cutting across the archway -- -- only in the daylit
strip the archway and the open space beyond literally
arent there

What the strip of day light illuminates is simply a narrow
strip of white-tiled bathroom wall perhaps six inches
wide Marla pulls away retreating from the light

AMY
Hurry up hurry up Go underneath
it

Marla advances cautiously then literally ducks underneath
the strip of reality and starts down the stairs Amy
hesitates reaching a hand out toward the illuminated
strip But as soon as her hand passes into the range of
the light her fingers change turning grey the nails
black -- the hand of somebody dead

Gasping she pulls her hand back then she too starts
to duck underneath the illuminated strip Another crack
and the strip widens -- now almost a foot of the archway
has become solid wall Gasping Amy ducks low beneath
the light and the solid wall it illuminates and heads
down the stairwell

CUT TO

INT NIGHT THE STAIRWELL

These are steep and narrow made of some dull scuffed
black stone The walls are unfinished the flip side of
a lathe and plaster wall Marla is waiting some distance
down the stairs

Amy descends toward her There is another crack from
above She turns to look back the way she came

From the night side the odd phenomenon is reversed
In the areas unlit from the bathroom side the bathroom
is clearly visible

But the areas lit from the far side appear to be physical
gaps opening onto a literal continuation of the stairs
running up into darkness As Amy watches the cracks
seem to compound

Slash by slash the bathroom vanishes from view revealing
more and more of the alternate reality -- the night
reality consisting of a stairway impossibly long reaching
impossibly high

Finally with a dull boom the final sliver of the bathroom
vanishes from view Now only the endless stairway remains

AMY
What

MARLA
Its all daylight now on the other
side Wow That was close I was
worried

AMY
Worried

MARLA
Come on Lets see where this thing
leads to

Marla starts down the stairs Amy follows

AMY
You really dont know

Marla turns back looks down toward Amys feet trailing
blood Vaguely embarassed Marla looks away talking to
Amy as she precedes her down the stairs

MARLA
See you see thats the problem
Im supposed to help you Like
like Carl helped Sheila Like Marybeth
helped me But I dont know if I
can You see thats my trouble

AMY
No I dont see I dont see one
fucking thing

MARLA
Okay Analogy Its like a tightrope
walker youre walking along on

this rope and everythings fine and
then ail of a sudden its like your
realize -- fuck Im walking on a
fucking rope a hundred feet up in the
air And thats when you fall I
was in the room with the other deaders
for my initiation I put my head
through a noose and I jumped ten feet
down and broke my neck and crushed
my throat And they cut me down and
my friend Marybeth breathed into me
and I was alive She was my guide
And my revivalist Shes so great
you know And everybody was happy
and like congratulating me

AMY
Then what happened

Marla pauses on the stairs Amy stands behind her
looking down at her not knowing quite what to do Then
suddenly Marla seems to fold up She slides down and
lies curled up against the wall sobbing Amy doesnt
know quite what to do

Finally awkwardly she slides down and sits as next to

Marla as she can given that the stairs arent wide enough
for them to sit two abreast She reaches out a tentative

hand and touches her on the shoulder

Clearly Amy isnt used to doing this sort of thing even
for alive person never mind a dead one

AMY
Come on come on dont you know
dont be doing that
(pause)
Marla Marla what happened to

you

Marla looks up her face wet with yellowish tears

MARLA
For awhile everything was fine
But
(struggles to control
herself)
But I cant I cant make myself stop

thinking that Im dead And Im stuck
So long as Im thinking I say to myself
I cant be dead You know I think
therefore I am But its like I think
therefore I am -- fucked Because I
cant stop thinking that I should be
dead I tried to kill myself a second
time Didnt work How could it How
could it Already dead So what Im
supposed to say is in terms of the
bleeding it cant kill you unless
youre sure that it has to

AMY

Oh come on what the fuck does that
mean How the hell am I supposed to

do th

MARLA
Like I said Wrong person to ask
Right Just just think of it this

way
Marla turns and stares up at Amy

MARLA
Youre sitting here talking to a
rotting corpse An hour ago I stabbed
you in the heart but you feel no
pain and youre still walking around
Isnt that a bit unusual Dont you
find it difficult to reconcile this
state of affairs with your previous
view of reality Why arent you dead
Why arent I

AMY
I dont know I just dont know

MARLA
Because when its dark enough theres
no such thing No difference between
dead and alive Corpses can talk people
can be stabbed in the heart and not
die
(MORE )

MARLA (CONTD)
You can turn into anything Make
anything be anything Where you can
blow your brains out and still be
just fine In the daylight that cant
be But in the night world in this
world it can You see its easy to
say but its not easy to do As as
witness me

AMY
Why am I bleeding like this

MARLA
Dont you understand

AMY
Stop asking me that

Marla turns and starts down the stairs Amy follows

MARLA
Fine Youre bleeding because you want
to be Youre the one whos in charge
Youve been in charge ever since you
saw me in the bathroom Everything
thats happened to you is the way
you wanted it to be We all find our
own way Sometimes it gets you
through Sometimes its a dead end
Pardon the expression This is the way
youve picked

AMY
I didnt choose you to stab me in the
back

MARLA
Yes you did Heres the final
ultimate deal It isnt enough for
somebody else to stick a knife into
you Thats just a passive thing it
still lets you have doubts You
have to come to the point where you

can do it to yourself -- thats the
test Thats the acceptance Fora
second I was there like I had no

doubts for that second But they
came back

AMY
You have to know how to stop this
bleeding

MARLA
Oh God Bleeding bleeding bleeding
(pause)
If you say so maybe I do

AMY
Well then stop it

MARLA
Hey

Marla hesitates gestures downward Theyve come to the
bottom of the stairs A narrow door swinging door with a
circular window in it lets in a shaft of artificial
light

The sounds from the other side are oddly familiar -- the
clank of pots and pans clinking glasses the echoes of
VOICES

It sounds like the kitchen of a restaurant

AMY
What should we do There are people
there

MARLA

Dont worry about that Thats not
daylight Were still in the night
world Nothing can hurt you here
except yourself As um as evidence
me Lets go look

Marla moves down the stairs with Amy trailing hesitantly
behind her

AMY
There are people

Marla looks back toward her questioning

AMY
Im all bloody I dont want them to
see me

Marla stares at her for a second and then frustrated
gestures to herself clearly shes a much more frightful
sight Then without a word Marla goes to the bottom of
the steps and starts through the door

Amy moves toward her

AMY
Fear is where you go to learn
MARLA
Its where you go and sometimes

its where you stay

She doesnt wait for Amy but pushes through As the
door flaps back and forth the sound grows loud and soft
loud and soft Amy suddenly aware of her aloneness
hurries after her She shoves through the swinging door

CUT TO
INT NIGHT THE KITCHEN

Amy pushes through the door and stops staring at the
place not knowing quite what to make of it Through the
steamy air Amy can see what looks on the surface like
the kitchen of a Chinese Restaurant

Rows of metal counters great steaming pots

CHEFS and WAITERS move about carrying trays of orders
carrying food to be prepared Others are cooking at great
blazing ovens stirring who-knows-what in big woks with
the splashes senting out great whooshes of fire

Amy looks left and right trying to find Marla Finally
she spots her moving down a narrow corridor squeezing
past Waiters and Chefs

Shes almost out of sight

Amy moved forward at once almost colliding with a gaunt
WAITER burdened with a tray covered with little covered
metal dish As they bump one of the silver covers on
one of the silver serving dishes jiggles splattering
some red down the side of the dish

Amy glances toward the Waiter who glances at her with
glazed dead eyes

As the Waiter moves on Amy turns and looks back down the
aisle Marla is out of sight She pushes forward urgent
circling around the various figures leaving bloody
footprints on the floor behind her

AMY
Ma Marla Marla

But theres no answer She reaches an intersection where
two aisle cross she looks this way and that

The aisles seem to literally reach to the horizon or at
least as far as she Can see before they vanish into
steam

Abruptly something wet drips down onto her arm It is
something thick like reddish oil She looks up

Above her strung in rows like so many Peking Ducks are
dead cats hanging from strings their skins shaved
red-orange with whatever theyve been cooked in

Theres a loud bang Amy turns

On the far side of the Counter she sees a row of CHINESE
CHEFS all grossly overweight They are wielding cleavers
chopping something on the tables in front of them We
dont see what but their faces have a kind of fiendish
glee as they chop and chop red and black splashing up
onto their white aprons

As Amy stares at them more closely she can see that these
Chefs are distinctly wrong -- some of them with visible
but bloodless wounds others with glazed eyes one with a
head that appears to be rather the wrong shape for a living
persons head

Amy backs away moving down one of the aisles She
turns and sees Marla in the distance
AMY
Marla

She starts after her Abruptly a mouse goes flitting
across the floor Amy jumps back Then another one comes
running across She looks up One of the CHEFS is tending
one of those huge aluminum soup kettles

He lifts the metal lid

The kettle is literally full of mice roiling like a kind
of ghastly living liquid As he stirs the living mass
the occasional escapee jumps out and goes flitting across
the floor

She backs away knocking some pots and pans off a shelf
then turns and hurries in Marlas direction

But once again her guide has vanished She moves to the
next intersection staring this way and that No sign of
Marla -- and the ghastly kitchen still seems to go on
forever

She glances back the way she came

Coming down the crowded corridor following her bloody
trail is a scrawny BUSBOY pushing a broom wiping up
her bloody footsteps coming her way He looks up at her
and smiles -- the inside of his mouth altogether too red
to be natural

Be smiles with his bloody mouth nodding and keeps on
coming mopping up her bloody footsteps as he comes

Amy turns and starts to run no longer caring Panting
she shoves past a WAITER knocking him over and going
down with him The platters go flying along with their
contents

One of the dishes spills its contents in front of her
It is the face of a woman -- not a head but just the
face as if pealed neatly off the skull surrounding by
Chinese vegetables now spilled this way and that by the
fall

The womans hair is also apparently in place bright
dye-red hair trailing down one side The face is
Marybeths But taking the place of each eye finishing
off the hideous dish -- a decorative carrot curl

Amy has used up what terror she has She breaks down and
starts crying

AMY
Please please I dont want to
be here I dont want to be here

She hears the sound of a mop being dunked in water She
looks back The Busboy with his mop is still coming
still grinning

Amy turns glances underneath one of the metal tables
She can look through to the far side to the parallel
aisle She sees Marlas high-heeled boots clearly
nothing that anybody else in this place is wearing

AMY
Marla Marla

She scrambles up and starts down the aisle She reaches
a cross-aisle and turns heading back up the aisle where
shes seen Marla

But this aisle apparently doesnt go on forever In
fact it ends in a culvert where a big floor-to-ceiling
freezer stands And as the scene comes into view Amy
sees a cluster of the grotesque CHEFS shoving Marla into
the freezer

She is struggling her hands reaching

AMY
Marla

MARLA
Help Amy

But Marla cant stand against the Men They shove her
in start to close the door Her pale swollen hand reaches
out They push it in get the freezer door closed

Then they turn toward Amy She turns

The Busboy with the mop and bucket is coming washing up

her bloody footprints smiling as he comes Behind him

others are coming the demonic waiters and Chefs hemming
her in

Amy spots a carving knife on one of the preparation
tables She grabs it holds it out toward one of the
grossly fat CHEFS as he approaches The Chef stares at
her with glazed eyes then reaches forward and tugs up
his apron and undershirt pulling them up over the great
expanse of his belly and chest baring them

There seem to be no fewer than a dozen knives thrust in --
the handles have been broken off leaving merely the naked
metal edges almost flush to the skin to mark where
theyve been plunged in

Amy stands holding the weapon now clearly a useless
thing Slowly inch by inch she lets her hand fall
until the knife tumbles out She looks down and sees the
mop coming toward her She looks up into the face of
the blood-mouthed Busboy He smiles

Now hands are reaching for her She tries to shove them
away but in a moment shes overwhelmed lifted up

The Busboy stands leaning on his mop the same smile on
his face watching as the crowd carries Amy off down the
aisle crying making wordless panicked sounds
struggling squirming in their grip

The Busboy looks down Theres a trail of blood drops
He dips his mop in the bucket and follows cleaning up as
he goes

CUT TO

THE HEAT LOCKER

At any rate its someplace where carcasses of various
kinds are suspended from the ceiling by books Amy is
there now also hanging upside down in the near-dark her
hands bound behind her back her ankles tied together

The bindings between her ankles are strung onto the nasty
metal hook that holds her a couple feet up off the
ground

She looks to one side Near her hanging from another
hook is something that literally looks like a white
leopard But now though alive its barely moving its
white fur stained red

Further on other things some animal some human others
unrecognizable are hanging from the various hooks

Theres a clank and the metal door opens The great bulk
of one of the Fat Chefs blocks the door

He comes waddling in carrying a metal basin He goes
over to Amy

AMY
What do you want what

The Chef slides the basin beneath her head He takes a
small knife from his belt

AMY
Wait wait

But the Chef pays no more attention to her words than he
would to the squawking of a goose He takes her by the
hair turns her head to the side and calmly draws the
knife diagonally across the side of her neck opening up
the arteries

Amy screams as the blood begins to come out running down
her neck into her hair spilling into the bowl

AMY
No no please no I dont want to
be here I dont want to be here

But the Fat Chef pays her no mind He comes back up to
standing with a grunt turns and inspects the hanging
body of the leopard Apparently finding it satisfactory
he reaches up and unhooks it Draping the barely alive
thing across his huge back he heads out the door

Amy struggling weakly hears the door close with a metallic
bang

CUT TO
INT THE MEAT LOCKER

Some time later We can hear a slow irregular drip We
MOVE through the nightmarish place of death until we find
its source -- the basin beneath Amys head

As we watch a final drop of blood lands in it and the
ripples come to stillness Above Amy is there still
hanging still alive but hardly aware of her
surroundings

Theres a sound of movement a metallic clanking like a
padlock being locked and them a shadow falls across Amy
She moves her head slightly

Its Marla She bends down low so that her face is close
to Amys We dont know how much time has passed or where
shes been but the effects of decay seem even more
pronounced The eye lids on one of her eyes doesnt seem
to be working any more and the eye on that side sags
unpleasantly

MARLA
Okay Okay I think were making
progress

AMY
Wh-what

MARLA

You wanted the bleeding to stop
Its stopped I mean its kind of a
weird way to do it

AMY
No no no no oh Christ Oh
fucking Christ I dont want to be
here

MARLA
Me either This is some fucked up
place I mean really

AMY

I just want to go home I just want
to go home please

MARLA
Dont think that Personally I think
that was a big mistake trying to keep
my apartment

AMY
What

MARLA
It was like I wanted to be part of
this big black mystery this crazy
night nirvana thing -- but I didnt
want to give up my apartment I
thought I could keep a foot in the
daylight you know what I mean Im
speaking metaphorically But I dont
think that really works You cant
be a thing of the night and like
pay rent and stuff I think that
contributed to like my major
confusion and this whole situation

Amy meanwhile has started to cry though at first its a
bit hard to tell whether shes sobbing or laughing Marla
just sits a bit uncomfortable She fidgits feeling at
the corner of her sagging eye

MARLA
Come on its I dont know Its
okay

AMY
Tell me Tell me is it a dream

Am I dreaming

MARLA
Its the wrong question

AMY
Is it real Is all this real

MARLA
Wrong question

AMY
Am I crazy Is that it

MARLA
No no no Wrong question Major
wrong question

AMY
Why Is that it Is that it

-MARLA
Dont go there Amy Thats a dead
end You cant get where you need to
go going there

AMY
Going where Going where

MARLA
Look theres no dreaming theres no
waking no crazy no sane Nothing

like that
AMY
Thats it Ive got to be Ive
got to be losing my mind
MARLA
No its not your mind you want to

lose

Theres the sound of motion like approaching footsteps

MARLA
Listen we should go

AMY
Go

Now we see the latch on the door being tried --
also see a padlock holding the door closed

MARLA
I padlocked the door Now we need to
go You need to find the way out

Now theres thumping at the door as whatever it
other side tries to knock it down

MARLA
Amy
AMY
Crazy its crazy I dont have any
blood in me he cut my throat
MARLA

That doesnt matter Im not kid

AMY
He cut my throat You stabbed me
This is not real

and we

is on the

MARLA
Stop saying that

Theres a sound like the awkward ringing of a bell as
something metal shatters

Amy turns toward the door
One of the hinges has shattered and the latch itself
through which the padlock has been threaded is half-pulled

from the door frame

Theres another bang The metal freezer door moves
falling slightly out of the frame

AMY
I dont believe it I dont believe
it

MARLA

Amy youve got to stop thinking that

Now we see distorted hands reaching around the borders of
the door Fat swollen fingers thin withered ones the
black-nailed hands of children which scrabble at the
padlock trying to tug it free

AMY
Youre not here Youre not real
MARLA
Please stop saying that Please
AMY
I know it I know it This cant be
real None of this I dont believe

in it

The heavy door starts to squeak and pop hideously as the
force of weight on the other side begins to bend it in
the middle

Now whole arms are sliding through grabbing at the door
Marla turns to look then looks back toward Amy

MARLA
Please Amy please dont do this
Please dont leave me here

AMY

Go away go away Im not going anywhere with you All
of you go away Get away

Abruptly the door heaves forward and we see whats on
the other side The hands and arms are not connected to
separate beings but are stitched together into some
impossible Hydra-like thing arms threaded together into
a single mass like so many snakes The air fills with a
horrible wet tearing sound as it moves forward

AMY
No Get out Get out Get awa

CUT TO
INT DAY A BED

In an instant the noise and fury are gone Amys eyes
abruptly pop open

Shes lying on a white pillow with white sheets tucked
up over her She turns her eyes to one side Theres a
hospital curtain the kind on a railing pulled closed
around her She looks down

Shes lying in a hospital bed An IV needle is in her
arm The sound of other voices speaking quietly nearby --
apparently shes in a ward of some kind

She looks in the other direction Larry is there ina
chair watching her

LARRY
Good morning

She doesnt answer

LARRY
How are you

Abruptly Amys hand springs up to her throat feeling
for a wound Nothing She puts her hand to her chest

Abruptly the curtain tugs aside a bit and Bud enters
carrying two coffees

BUD
Hey what are you doing Checking to

AMY
Yes

BUD
Ooo-kay

He hands a cup to Larry

BUD

on her wrists She stares at them

LARRY

He reaches into his pocket and comes out with her sun
glasses He puts them on the table by her bed Larry
smiles turns and follows after Bud

The Orderly moves in closer

ORDERLY
Im going to sit you up

He puts down the railing on one side of the bed helps
her sit up and swing her legs out over the side of the
bed He puts one of those disposable thermometer things
in her mouth takes her pulse

AMY
What day is today

ORDERLY
Hmm Thursday

Be takes the thermometer writes some stuff down on the
chart

AMY
Means nothing to me

ORDERLY
Doctor Magid1ll be here in a minute

AMY
Thanks

The Orderly puts the chart on the bed and heads out Amy
sits for a moment turns looks out a nearby window
through which a bright if rather seedy day-lit view of
the city is visible

Something flickers by in her field of view She glances
down toward the lowered railing A fly is there It
meanders along the rail Amy reaches out and waves her
hand near it to shoo it away

But it doesnt go

She waves her hand again The fly ignores her She brings
her hand closer The fly abruptly buzzes off the railing
and lands on the back of her hand Amy stares at it for

an instant then brings her other hand down on top of the
fly with a slap

Or is it a slap

The sound seems somehow louder than it should and
strangely familiar A kind of crack -- like the cracks
that let the light of day into Marlas apartments

Amy freezes at the familiar sound Then hesitantly she
takes her hand away Theres no fly on the back of her
hand She turns the other hand around No fly in the
palm No sign of it

AMY
No please please

Then theres another crack She jumps turns toward the
table by the side of the bed

Nothing particularly sinister about it -- but something
different Theres a strip of shadow across it passing
close to her folded sunglasses

She reaches her hand cautiously out toward the shadow
Abruptly theres another crack and another shadow
abruptly falls across her sunglasses

Now it becomes clear that this isnt merely a shadow but
the bizarre inverse of the effect she witnessed before

Where the new sliver of shadow crosses her sunglasses
they appear shattered In the light -- intact in the
shadow broken

It is the night world leaking in

Hanging in the bright air in fact Amy can see the
shafts of darkness like shafts of light coming from
the direction of the window

She turns toward the window

She can see the splinters of darkness the reverse of
what she saw before revealing slivers of a night world
beyond the window utterly different from the daylit
world that now dominates

She rises moves toward the window then stops realizes
that shes still attached to the IV She reaches out
tears the bandage away and then with a hiss extracts
the needle

Theres another crack and another wider fissure cuts
across the window She moves forward breathing fast
making sure to avoid the shafts of darkness

She comes close to the wall with the window It is part
of a long open passage lined with windows like the one
shes standing before spaced at intervals along its
length facing the curtained beds A lone ELDERLY WOMAN
in a hospital gown is standing some distance down her
back to the wall some figure lost in her own world

There is another crack and another fissure in the
outside world opens up sending a shaft of darkness into
the room Now she hears other more distant cracks and
pops and when she looks down the hall she realizes that
the night is leaking in down its entire length

A distant sound like the sound of a subway train comes
to her ears She moves forward leaning to the side and
glances up through one of the wider gaps

OUT THE WINDOW

Through the dark gap in reality she can see an urban
landscape completely unlike the one visible in the daylit
world

An Elevated Train is roaring by above her making a nasty
clatter as it strikes some loose spot and sends out a
lightning-bright electric spark at regular intervals as
it passes

In the windows she can glimpse inhuman shapes but they
roar by too fast and are seen too distantly to make them
out with any certainty What she can be sure of is that
the sparks from the passing train are casting their light
upward -- revealing the shadowed areas above the El and
the low brick buildings that crowd it

And above them both impossibly -- there is a roof made
of girders and stained rotting concrete not merely
covering the train but somehow encompassing the entire
visible night world

She gasps Abruptly a voice sounds behind her

MAGID
Miss Klein Miss Klein

Amy turns abruptly DR MAGID a young Indian Doctor is
standing by the bed The bands of growing darkness are
cutting across him In the light of day he is simply a
familiar figure dressed in a white Doctors coat

But in the shadowed areas we glimpse things more
sinister Where it falls across his clothing we see a
coat stained with blood and filth Where it falls across
the side of his face we can glimpse flesh pale and
festering

AMY
Please please help me Its coming
again Its coming

MAGID
What is coming

AMY
The night please dont let it
take me I want to stay here

Theres another crack Amy lets out a shriek and jumps
aside

Now the new sliver of night falls more widely on the
Doctors face revealing more of the nightmarish dead
version -- an ear all but gone hair matted with black
stuff

AMY
Oh God dont let me go

Then the Doctor takes a step -- and comes almost completely
out of the shadow areas that he clearly does not see

He speaks in a calming confident voice the kind of
calculatedly gentle voice that comes from long experience
with the insane

MAGID
Miss Klein nothing is going to take
you away Please come back to bed
Come Take my hand I promise we
will not hurt you

He holds out his hand coming no closer Amy hesitates
then moves away ducking underneath one of the shafts of
darkness She reaches her hand out in little halting
jerks Magid remains calm impassive

MAGID
Im just going to give you an
examination and then well talk
All right

AMY
Yes

MAGID
Come just sit down here

She reaches out her hand touches his hesitant then
takes it He tightens his grip Then suddenly theres
a loud crack and a vertical fissure of darkness opens up
in the window behind them The shaft of darkness cuts
between them falling on their hands

Only now in the darkness from the night world the hand
that holds her is a ghastly wet thing -- and her hand in
the darkness is pale bruised splattered with blood

The hand starts to pull her only now Amy is pulling
away She looks up into the calm face of Dr Magid He
speaks but now his voice comes out distorted She cannot
understand the words

Instead the sound of the Elevated Train is coming again
louder She turns looks toward the window

The night world is gaining dominance -- and down the hall
the windows are a patchwork of day and night Another
train comes rumbling by outside Amy looks

THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE TRAIN

We see the faces of things dead things not human at all
Amy feels a sudden tug She looks back A band of
darkness abruptly cuts across the lower part of Magids
face The bland gentle face is suddenly replaced within
the night-lit world with a chinless gaping mouth lined
with tiny baby-shark teeth It speaks but this voice
though wet and whispery we now hear clearly

THE SHARK MOUTH
Help me Amy Klein Help me

AMY
Help help you

She tries harder to pull away but her bare feet slip on
the floor The Shark Mouth gapes as if trying to swallow
air And impossibly above it somehow connected to it
in some weird way is the face of Magid now starting to
look a bit alarmed

THE SHARK MOUTH

You know Marla Ima friend of
hers

AMY
What

Amy looks down The hand is pulling her harder She
struggles to break free but the grip of the wet nasty
hand is unbreakable

THE SHARK MOUTH
Maybe she mentioned me

AMY
No No

Finally Amy hauls back and punches back-handed at the
twin faces

Her hand hits something -- but it is not the Shark Face
that vanishes Rather the impact of her fist literally
seems to knock Magid out of view and in a single ripping
instant the day-lit world has vanished as if torn away
by her action

Now the corridor is all darkness except for strange
lights behind the curtains and the shadows of strange
things moving in the lights cast up on the curtains

But Amy has more immediate concerns With Magid torn
away the full features of the SHARK THING are now visible

It seems to have no rigidly fixed shape Rather its
face and form almost like liquid flow back and forth
sometimes more like a shark sometimes more like a
scrawny twenty-year old sometimes other things perhaps
the shadows of other living things bristle out on his
face or beneath his clothing and vanish

Amy now has also reverted to her night form -- back
in the same ragged black garments she wore before
bruised her hair clotted with blood the horrid knife
cut in her throat She gasps as the Shark Thing hauls
her close

SHARK THING
Are you sure she didnt talk about
me Im Bobby

AMY
Bobby you the one who got lost

SHARK THING
Lost Is that what happened Is it

AMY
She was afraid shed end up like you
Lost Thats thats what she said

SHARK THING
Where is she

AMY
I dont know

SHARK THING
Right Right So SHES lost Im
not lost Im right here with the
others
(leans close)
And with you

Abruptly he slides a ghastly arm around her shoulder and
turns her

SHARK THING
And if if you can save her why not

me Be my guide find your way
out and Ill follow
AMY

I dont even know where I am

The Shark Thing begins to laugh a weird wet laugh He
thrusts his face into hers

SHARK THING
I dont even know THAT I am Its
one great fucking mystery only its
got no last page It just keeps
getting more and more fucking
mysterious until you cant even
remember where one things leaves off
and another begins

He leans in close to her And then suddenly its as if
the two literally begin to melt together Amy screams
and it echoes unnaturally loud down the long corridor
She twists wildly and literally tears loose from the
Shark Thing tumbling to the ground her clothing torn
around the shoulder back and side her skin exposed
weirdly raw

She grabs a wheeled IV holder and flings it toward the
Shark Thing As it hits she turns stumbles and starts
running down the corridor The IV pole has buried itself
in the Shark Things shoulder as if in clay He tears
it lose and throws it to the ground

SHARK THING
She knows the way out She knows the
way Follow her

As Amy runs suddenly the curtains start to tear open
behind her next to her in front of her and THINGS come
loping out Some rotted like Marla some much worse
little more than skeletons

Other THINGS incomplete like human beings melted like
plastic or in pieces cut apart and glued back together
And still others like the Shark Thing weird half-
finished amalgams of Human and Other

AMY
I dont know I dont know anything

The Shark Thing comes loping after her

BOBBY
Liar Liar Wheres Marla She
should be here with us

Amy stops finding herself face to face with a broken-
necked Horror dives to the floor and scampers under it

Other things paw at her some with rotting fingers
others with animal paws or wet tendrils She dives to
the side clambering over the beds tearing the curtains
aside as the awakened things come after her Abruptly
she finds that one of the curtains is literally clinging
to her wrapping itself around her Gasping she grabs
it and tears The thing whatever it is is alive and
as it tears we see tissue tear wetly blood weave out it
screams as she flings it away

But the mob is clearly crowding her threatening to
overwhelm her They press her forward until she comes to
the far wall

AMY
Get away I dont know where Marla is
I cant help you Leave me alone Get
away

She comes to a narrow door she grabs for the knob tries
to pull it open against the press of people Suddenly
she spots the Shark Thing trying to make its way through
the undead press Abruptly she points at him

AMY
He knows Bobby knows Follow him
He knows

Abruptly eyes turn toward the Shark Thing It is only a
brief confusion some ignoring her words others pressing
back toward Bobby but it gives Amy the moment she needs

She hauls the door open and throws herself in pulling it
shut behind her

INT THE CLOSET

Her fingers find the little latch and she turns it locking
the door -- but as she turns she realizes that this is

the deadest of dead ends -- a closet barely three feet

deep and three feet wide and those three feet are
cluttered with mops and detergent and god-knows-what

She presses her hands against the door and her back
meets the back of the closet -- not even enough room for
her to hold her arms out straight in front of her

She can hear the sounds of the Things on the other side
scratching hammering She watches the door move as they
pull at the door knob trying to get in

Abruptly theres a sudden loud roar and something huge
and white like a white tiger comes literally out of
nowhere shoving her against the side of the closet with
its huge paws on her shoulders Or was it a tiger

In an instant the paws are hands and the ferocious
white furred face is replaced by a familiar one Its
Winter He leans in close -- what else can he do in this
narrow space

WINTER
I hate repeating myself Amy Klein
Youre more trouble than youre worth

AMY
I I

WINTER
Dont say anything Whatever you say
its wrong Dont ask any questions
Dont look for any answers Theres a
kind of fire that you cant steal and
carry back to the world All you can
do is let yourself be consumed by it
Burnt up so that theres no you left
Only the fire Now listen to me
Theres a Way that Ive made Youre
on it Make no mistake It is no more
real than I am or that you are I
made it to bring people to me that are
congenial to my sensibilities Nothing
more Those that are come through
Those that cant get through or who
cant hold on -- end up here Forever
But now youve created a problem for
me Ive made the Way and I cant
break it without disrupting
everything Ive made for myself But
the Way requires that the initiates
like you have a Guide But as you
may have noticed youve misplaced
your Guide

AMY
Where is sh

Winter shoves Amy hard against the wall

WINTER
I said Dont ask any questions
Now here is what Im going to do to
remedy this situation If shes lost
she cant guide you she cant witness
your initiation and she cant revive
you So you must find her You find
her by wanting to I have decided that
you two are now one Ive said it
That makes it so You find her wake
her up When you initiate yourself
she will witness it and she will
believe and be reborn and then SHE
will revive YOU If you cant do what
you need to do then the both of you
can stay here forever Thats all
Thats all Im willing to do Anything
more will wreck my whole night world
and youre not worth it One final
thing To get where youre going you
have to leave everything behind
Everything

AMY
I know Even myself

WINTER
(pause)
Maybe youll be decent company after
all There are advantages to
nothingness Amy Klein But its not
for everybody

Winter takes a step back -- strange considering that
theres no room to do it -- and folds into the wall Amy
is alone There is silence now The door is still She
looks at it then turns toward it unlocks in and shoves
it open The Ward is gone Now there is a flight of
wide marble steps leading down into darkness

INT THE STEPS

She comes out of the closet and stands on the upper
landing Then she calmly begins to undress tossing aside
her bloody clothing She tears through the duct tape

that holds the now-useless towel to the wound-in her back
It comes away sticky She drops it steps out of her
panties black with dried blood

She stands naked her body covered with bruises and
stained with blood

Then she starts down the stairs her bare feet making
echoing slaps on the cold marble She comes to the
bottom There are double swinging doors there with
circular windows in them -- unpleasantly like the door
that opened onto the nightmare Chinese kitchen She moves
forward and pushes through

INT NIGHT THE MORGUE

Thats what this place is apparently The room is spare
and metallic Rows of drawers stand against a far wall
There are no bodies out Everything is neatly tucked
away

She crosses to one of the drawers There is no
hesitation She grabs it and pulls it out Theres a
great buzzing of flies as Marla still in her green
plastic raincoat and underwear comes sliding out But
now she looks dead Really dead -- and really dead for
awhile The flies have laid their eggs and the eggs
have made maggots and the maggots are doing their work
on her face and on the exposed parts of her body

Her eyes are open but sunken the orbs all gray Amy
leans down close to her She speaks in a quiet voice

AMY
Marla its Amy Wake up

Marla doesnt stir Amy bends down even closer

AMY
Marla Wake up Youre not dead and
you cant stay here Marla Wake up

Now Amys lips are almost touching Marlas dead ones
Then they do touch Amy brushes her lips against Marlas
then kisses her lightly

AMY
Marla I need you Wake up

Amy hesitates an instant waiting then kisses her more
deeply

AMY
Wake up

Then with a wet sticky sound Marlas eyes turn They
see Amy Her lips move

AMY
You know me Youre my guide Tell
me what to say Tell me what to do
Come with me Ive come to learn
and Im not afraid any more

Marlas lips begin to move as she struggles to speak
The words begin to come out little more than breath

MARLA
M-m-my skin

AMY
My skin

MARLA
--isnt real

AMY
--isnt real

MARLA
My eyes arent real

AMY

My eyes arent real

MARLA
My muscles

Now Amy begins to speak over her sometimes coming in a
bit late synchronizing the litany

AMY
My muscles

MARLA AND AMY
arent real My bones my heart
heart my veins and nerves and flesh
and meat arent real

MARLA
What I see what I hear what I taste
what I touch what I remember what I
think what I feel

AMY
What I see and hear and taste and
touch What I remember what I think
what I feel arent real

MARLA
Arent real

But now Marlas final words this time following Amys
come in a much stronger voice Amy looks down at her

She seems to have shifted into an odd state Her prior
intact self is there but the deader version flickers
across her skin like sparks no longer dominant but
still there She sits up Amy stares at her

AMY
Im not real

Abruptly the room is now no longer empty There are
familiar figures there Carl Marybeth Sheila And
Winter standing in the background

WINTER
Go on

AMY
Im not real

Marla slides off of the sliding table Hands help Amy
climb up She lies down

AMY
Im not real

Sheila comes up to Marla and places the 45 -- the big
gun in Marlas hand Marla turns and places it in Amys

AMY
Im not real

She places the gun to her head Marla leans over and
kisses her

MARLA
Youll be back

Amy stares at her smiles
We MOVE IN in an instant as her finger tugs the trigger
No hesitation But there is no sound of an explosion
Instead we --

CUT TO
INT NIGHT STATIC
Instead of the sound of a gunshot we suddenly find

ourselves lost in some bright flickering space filled
with the sound of static

Abruptly the static vanishes the flickering space
congeals and we realize that we are watching a
television screen

And as we PULL RACE we realize that we are seeing the
original footage showing the death of Sheila Its Buds
office late at night Hes there in the dark watching
the tape

He weighs the remote control loosely in his hand The
door opens and Larry comes in He watches Bud for a
moment Bud for his part doesnt even seem to notice
that hes there

LARRY
I was just over at the 14th Precinct
You know I know Tommy McKay hes a
detective over there

BUD

LARRY

BUD

LARRY

month

BUD
So you think they met with foul play

LARRY

ou Marla was a traitor for sending

dead They were taken somewhere and
killed Theres no other explanation

BUD
Too bad It would have made a hell of
a story Still would if I could find
somebody else crazy enough to do it

LARRY
Yeah Well Im quitting

Bud keeps watching the tape He doesnt answer

LARRY

BUD

What do you want me to do Give you
an argument So youre quitting

Good bye

LARRY

(pause)
You ought to stop watching that thing
man Its getting to be a bad habit

BUD

Your concern for my welfare is greatly
appreciated as always Larry See
you around

Larry turns and walks out the door As he closes it Bud

hears a voice

AMY

Hey there Bud

Bud jumps turns

Amy is sitting on the couch dressed

as she was when we first saw her and wearing her black

sunglasses

BUD

Jesus fucking Christ Amy How the
hell did you get in here And where
the fuck have you been You know some
people have been looking for you

AMY

Dont worry Bud

BUD

Who said I was

AMY

Why are you watching the tape Bud

Hmm

BUD

AMY

Why are you watching the tape What
do you think youre going to see

BUD
Shit I I dont know What the
hells the matter with you

But Amy doesnt speak She just watches him from behind
the opaque disks of her sunglasses

BUD
I sent you out to find out what the
fuck I was seeing

AMY
Dont be afraid Bud

BUD
Im not afraid Its just a fucking
piece of video tape Fine you dont
want to look fine

He grabs for the remote control It goes flying off the
little table and lands on the floor in between the two
They both bend over reach down for it As they do Amys
sunglasses fall onto the floor Bud hesitates then picks
up the remote Amy remains in her bent over position

AMY

I meant dont be afraid of me
BUD

What
AMY

Dont be afraid Im not real

BUD
What do you

Bud looks up And Amy starts to raise her head

BUD
What

Bud looks and freezes his eyes wide
AMY
I said Bud dont be afraid Im

not real

And as she utters the final words she turns her head up
We see what Bud has already seen

The eyes revealed by the falling of the sunglasses are
simply not there at all They are simply holes
stretching into the empty blackness of Amy skull

AMY
Im not real

FADE OUT
THE END
