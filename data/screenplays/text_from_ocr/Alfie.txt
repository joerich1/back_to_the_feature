ALFIE’S VOICS
You’re quite lucky you know

INT STUDIO APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

CAMERA EXPLORES the room Modest messy and male dust the
basics No photos of family or friends Only telltale signs
of a single untidy man living alone An ad torn from 4
magazine picturing a classic Morgan sports car is taped to
the refrigerator with Nant It scrawled in black marker

A stack of books - French For Fun Dress Fer Success For
Less - A Guide To New York’s Designer Discount Warehouses

A ¢lock on the night-stand tells us it’s half past two

ALFIBE‘S VOICE
-- I rarely allow anyone into my
flat

TRACK IN ON — ALFIE

Sleeping with a wry smile on his face A beat then One
eye POPS OPEN and Alfie GLANCES CONSPIRATORIALLY at CAMERA

This ig gomething he will do throughout our story speak in
intimate asidas to the audience as though he’s talking to a
friend Other characters within the scene will be oblivious

ALFIE

(to CAMERA)
I know humble digs not exactly
what youd call a ‘panty peeler’

He pulls himself out of bed wearing only striped silk pajama
bottoms drops to the floor

ALFIE (contd)
Know what I mean

With that he begins a quick series of crunches

Alfie is an Englishman in his early thirties with tousied
good-looks and a healthy doseof cockiness He Lives in
perpetual motion and has the youthful air of a guy whos
managed to escape the normal adult resoonsibilities and
emotions
ALFIE (CONTD)
(to CAMERA while doing
crunches)
-- but it works for me To be
honest I rarely spend a night in
my own bed anyway

Another five or six crunches

ALFIE CONTD)
There we go Ten crunches is all I
need Try not to hate me for it

Alfie continues talking TC CAMERA as he hoos up and gathers a
handzul of vitamins from various bottles and pours some
water

ALFIE (CONT’D
Now with women generally speaking
if a guy’s a good provider and a
nice chap six-pack abs aren’t
really a deal-breaker In fact if
he’s in the right tax bracket a
bloke can be bald wear a truss
have seizures - and still get
shagged

Alfie swallows a mouthful of vitamins with water then grabs
a pack of Dunhills

ALFIE (CONTD)

(confidentially)
On the flip-side even though the
politically-correct bloke sitting
nex to you will deny it - for us
men when it comes to women it’s
all about the FBB - face boobs
bottom I mean sure we’d like a
cool gig tossed in for good
measure like say
multi-millionaire hotel chain
heiress But above all else -—
‘jooks rule’

He lichts his cigarette and gives CAMERA a sly shrug

ALFI£ (CONTD)
Just being honest

INT TINY BATHROOM

Alfie turns on the shower cigarette dangling from his lips
unties his drawstrings looks up remembering THE CAMERA
ALFIE (contd)
Give us a bit of privacy now
(a beat)
No really turn away

He SHOCS US AWAY then slips out of his pajama bottoms and
into the shower pulling the shower doar closed behind him

ALFIE (CONTD)
All right you can look back Hang
an Ill be quick

Through OPAQUE GLASS we watch Alfie lathering up

ALFIE (CONTD
(shouting over the shower
I know you’re expecting the opening
credits now but well save you the
thrill of knowing the Key Grip’s
name ‘til the end of the flick

He peeks his SOAPY HEAD out looks about fifteen

ALFIE CONTD
So while I lather up why don’t
you settle in with the popcorn you
overpaid for and we can begin

Alfie ducks back into the shower and begins singing a
garbled almost unrecognizable version of I Gotta Be Me

A CLOSET DOOR SLIDES OPEN

ALFIE (03
It’s been said that clothes speak
the international language

REVEALING Alfie’s small but fastidiously organized and
supremely fashionable WARDROBE Alfie sorts threugh the
cheices while glancing over his shoulder AT CAMERA

ALFIE (CONTD)
And I admit I am a bit of a fashion
whore But I believe to he
satorically-correct a man requires
only a few well-chosen basics

7 SERIES OF RAPID-FIRE CUTS

Alfie posing as if for a GO layout wearing a quick
succession cf STYLISH WARDROBE COMBCS He models these
outfits in a slightly rumpled hair tousled sort of way
giving the impression of never trying too hard
BACK TO SCENE
He selects a pin-striped suit from the closet

ALFIE

Unfortunately today tm off to
work so we’ve got to tone it down a
bit

(holds up suit)
Gueci - End of Sunmex Sale Very
understated

(takes out a very pink

shirt)
But I can easily spice it up When
you ooze masculinity as some of us
do you have no reason to fear
pink

He holds up the shirt and suit together

ALFIE (CONTD)
Smashing

A little smile as he picks up a bottle of Acqua Di Gio
cologne

ALFIE (CONTD)
Now most men overdo it in the
cologne department Americans
practically spray it on with a crop
duster
dabs his wrists
My rule Nothing ahove the neck

Alfie then splashes a bit on his fingers and drops his HAND
RELOW FRAME

ALFIE (CONTD)
Though I do believe in a quick
aplash on the old Eiffel Tower
(winks)
Never know where the day might
take you

INT APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - MINUTES LATER

Rlfie dressed smartly ir his suit and a carefully chosen
tie adiusts his cuff-links and starts to exit snaps his
fingers remembering something

ALFIE
Almost forgot--
He crosses to the dresser and tears a page off a WORD FOR THE
DAY CALENDAR

ALFIE (contd)
New word for the day

attract attention to one’s self”

He Looks in the mirror

He crosses te her and leans in with a husky whisper

ALFIE (CONTD)

As Mrs Schnitman melts Alfie LOOKS UP to CAMERA

ALFIE (CONTD)
All right she’s a tub of lard buz
the ship’s already sailed 30 why
not let her feel gcod about
herself Know what I mean

He starts out turns back to Mrs Schnitman

ALFIE (CONTD)
Oh Lu don’t feel you have to but
the key’s under the mat if you’ re
up for a bit of your fabulous dust-
busting

The look on her face tells us she can’t wait to grab that
Dirt Devil

And with that MUSIC BEGINS Sting singing Englishman In New
York

EXT SOHO STREET - DAY (MUSIC OVER)

Alfie expertly weaves through the gridiock on his mint-
condition vintage VESPA all the while SPEAKING to CAMERA
Alfie smiles at every SEXY WOMAN he passes Most smile back

ALFIE
I migrated to the States a few
years back ‘cause I had a mate who
knew a bloke who crossed the pond

years wound up owning the joint
A STUNNER gives him the once-over

ALFIE (cont’d

But more importantly I always

Alfie pulls into the RED ZONE in front of an OUTDOOR CAFR -
where a curvy Hispanic METER MAID is writing up a ticket
ALFIE (CONTD)
- how could I ever choose to
settle down with just one

The Meter Maid looks up at Alfie then at the RED ZONE then
gives him a scolding look Alfie approaches all charm

ALFIE (CONTD)
Desperately need a spot of tea

METER MAID

ALFIE

Alfie offers Lindy his patent killer smile pats her butt and
cruises toward a cafe table Lindy watches him for a moment
slaps a ticket on someone’s car He’s made her day
ALFIE - SEATED AT THE CAFE (MUSIC CONTINUES)

He sips a cup of tea while observing a parade of scurrying
suits and shoppers laden with designer store bags
ALFIE (contd)

(ta CAMERA

LOUDER Alfie gives a LCOK to CAMERA

ALFIE

softly to CAMERA
I think this just might be my
favorite position I know it was
President Kennedys He was such a
great leader Of course JFK used
the old ‘bad back’ excuse but if
you ask me the Prez knew it gave
you maximum pleasure with minimum
exertion

Dorie reaches a climax during above and now collapses into
Alfie’s arms

DORIE
Mmmm What is it about the hack
of a limo

Alfie kisses her neck while CONTINUING to CAMERA

ALFIE
She’s right you know If you
haven’t tried it limo-style I give
it my highest recommendation Of
coursé you usually don’t get the
full undress--

Dorie buries her head in his neck

ALFIE (CONTD)
to CAMERA

A light rain falls on Alfie standing under a street lamp
smoking and looking up at his apartment window

ALFIE
Remember how Little Alfie finally
got what he wanted for Christmas

Alfie looxs around A TRANSFORMATION has taken place The
apartment is spotlessly clean and organized The only chore
left undone is the half-painted Indigo blue wall

Soft soul music plays on the stereo Candles illuminating a
romantic table set for two have burned low Nikki dozes on
the sofa Alfie sighs TURNS to CAMERA

ALFIE (CONTD)
-- Be careful what you wish for

He crosses to the sofa and gently shakes Nikki She doesn’t
budge He shakes her again and she wakes with a start
Looks at him for a beat lixe she doesn’t recognize him then
smiles sleepily

ALFIE CONTD

NIKKI
So Alfie Ive been thinking

potatoes I know I’ve been a
handful lately but I think that

displaced and not totally trusting--

Her VOICE DIALS down as she CONTINUES TALKING Alfie STEPS
to CAMERA

ALFIE
Can you believe she picks tonight
to act sane again This is gonna
be tricky

MORE

ALFIE (contd)
When they’re this vulnerable
youve got to watch your step
You dont want ‘em swallowing a
handful of pills and leaving a note
addressed to you Very tricky

He STEPS ASIDE and Nikkis VOICE is DIAIRn UP again

NIKKI
-- but I’m as blown away as you are
that something real seems to be
happening between us and--
(stops to herself
Okay Nik get a grip don’t bury

revealing the roast)
So Come Sil A feast awaits

ALFIE

She moves to him puts her hands on his shoulders and smiles

NIKKI
What’s up Alfie

ALFIE
Nothing its just I don’t know

feeling a bit---
Nikki steps back realizing something’s off She’s suddenly
wary a little scared

NIKKI
What Cold Distant Remote

ALFIE
Lock Nikki this is a complete
drag but everything happened so
quickly and I don’t know I’m
not the best at this sort of
thing

NIKKI
(knowing exactly what he
means
What sort of thing

ALFIE
-- I don’t know exactly how to say
it

NIKKT
Sure you da Alfie You’ve had
plenty of experience dumping girls
A look passes between them

Nikki crosses the room pulls her suitcase from the closet
She sets it on a chair opens it and iooks at Alfie

NIKKI (CONTD)
Don’t worry I’m already gone

EXT STREET - HIGH SHOT - NIGHT

Pouring rain Nikki wearing a raincoat but without an
umbrella holds her suitcases while trying to hail a cab

CAMERA EASES BACK to see we are OVER ALFIE’S SHOULDER as he
looks out his window Nikki waves down a Taxi and struggles
with her suitcases finally climbing in and slamming the
door

As the Taxi disappears in the rain
ALFIE’S VOICE
(sounding raspy now
Strange but even when you know it
has to end
DISSOLVE TO
EXT ALFIE’S APARTMENT BUILDING -— A FEW WEEKS LATER

Pouring rain OVER we HEAR Alfie in a raspy voice

ALFIE’S RASPY VOICE
-- when it finally dees you always
get that inevitable twinge--

INT ALFIE’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

Rain streaks the windows Nikkis gone and the apartment is
once again modest messy and male Nikki’s presence echoed
by the half-painted INDIGO BLUE wall

CAMERA DISCOVERS Alfie sitting on the edge of the sofa
shining his shoes with a corner of his comforter a blanket
draped over his shoulders He has a cold and looks the worse
for wear He glances up AT CAMERA

ALFIE

raspy)
have I done the right thing

He blows his nose into a handkerchief pulls himself up
crosses to the KITCHEN AREA where a can of tomato soup is
boiling over the top of a sauce pan

ALFIE (CONTD)
I admit I do miss the
companionship

He turns off the burner and pours the soup into a coffee muc
takes a sip

ALFIE CONTD)
-- and Nikki was a show-stopper

He moves to his closet where he removes a sport coat from its
plastic cover and slips it on

ALFIE CONTD
But as my ugly Aunt Gladys used to
say ‘Looks ain’t everything’ I
used to think that wags a load of
bollix but lately I’ve come to
believe the old bat may have had
something

He culls on his raincoat gives himself a final m‘rror-check
and heads for the door As he’s about to exit he TURNS BACK
to CAMERA

ALFIE (CONTD)
One thing I do know You can’t
really take away a girl’s dreams if
you don’t have new ones to replace
them with

Somewhere a CHURCH BELL is ringing
CUT TO
B CHURCH SPIRE
The BELLS RINGING CAMERA TILTS DOWN to the entrance as
THE CHURCH DOORS

are flung open and JULIE and TERRY bounce out with MAX and
the Teddy Bear Terry gave him for his birthday They 211
hold hands in a row like a family foursome

Julie grasps a wedding bouquet and looks radiant All three
are dressed to the nines laughing and seemingly bursting
with happiness A small Group of Friends and Family follow
milling on the church steps with hugs and kisses while a
PHOTOGRAPHER grabs shots During

ALFIE’S VOICE
Jules had left a phone message It
wasn’t an invitation so much as a
notification

Alfie watches from the safety of a nearby alcove TURNS to
CAMERA

ALFIE
But my curiosity got tne best of
me

Julie takes Terrys lapels and pulls him to her kissing him
Everyone cheers

ALFIE (CONTD)
I wish it hadn‘t

The Well-wishers clap and cheer them on to hold Lhe kiss

ALFIE CONTD)
You know it’s funny but Jules used
to say she couldn’t live without
me

Alfie shrugs Such is life He steps from the cover of the
alcove and catches little Max’s eye gives him a wave

Max just stands there hugging his Teddy either no longer
remembering Alfie or no longer trusting him

Alfie slips back out of sight as the Newlyweds break and
Terry picks Max up Max throws his arms around lerry’s neck
the way he used to do with Alfie

Alfie watches “The New Family” posing for pictures in front
of the church

ALFIE’S VOICE
I had the sudden realization that
I‘d probably never see Jules and
Max again

Alfie hidden in the shadows of the alcove LOOKS zo CAMERA

ALFIE
This was followed by a very
unpleasant feeling in the vicinity
of my heart

He glances back for one final look then walks away

CAMERA TRACKS Alfie walking along the river He passes a
YOUNG COUPLE leaning against the rail laughing and then
seriously making-out

ALFIE (CONTD)
(to CAMERA
The thing about feelings is they
have this quiet way of creeping up
on you when you least expect it

CAMERA DRIFTS CLOSER to Alfie as he wanders along the
bridge

ALFIE (CONTD)
Like with Liz Who would’ve
thought out of all the birds I’ve
known it would be her the cne
who in most ways gave me the
least would end up hurting me
the most

(pause)
My life’s my own

NOW ALFIE WALKS TOWARD CAMERA

He stops stares out at the darkness for a time then LOOKS
DIRECTLY at CAMERA

ALFIE

But I don’t have my peace of mind
And if you don’t have that
youve got nothing really

(pause)
So what’s the answer That’s what
I keep asking myself

(a beat)
What’s it all about You know what
I mean

Alfie turns and looks off A little MUTT trots toward him
Alfie smiles bends to pet him the Deg licks Alfie’s fase

WOMAN’ S VOICE
Ohmygod thanks He’s always
running away

Alfie looks up and sees a lovely BREATHLESS YOUNG WOMAN
holding a leash and smiling down at him Maybe it’s her
siightly embarrassed manner or the way her nose crinkles
when she smiles or maybe it’s the way the scarf is tied
European-style around her neck Or maybe it’s just tine

Alfie rises holding the dog

ALFIE
What’s
(checks quickly and
discreetly)
-- nis name

YOUNG WOMAN
Mugsy

ALFIE
(looks at dog)
Hello Mugsy
looks at the Girl
I’m Alfie

THE RIVER’S EDGE - HIGH SHOT
Alfie and the Breathless Girl talk for a few moments then

Alfie sets the little Mutt down and they all walk along the
river’s edge together

And the song begins

What’s it all about Alfie
is it just for the moment we live

What’s it all about when you sort
it out Alfie

Are wé meant to take more than we
give

Or are we meant to love

Alfie

FADE OUT
