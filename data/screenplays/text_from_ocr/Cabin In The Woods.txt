nerdy but they have a sweet rapport

HADLEY

Hoisting files and in Sitterson’s case a small white
cooler -- the kind that might carry organs -- they exit
into

Dana ia in shirt and undies packing for a trip and
bopping softly to the music which now comea from her
little atereo She does thet singing-along thing where

through her sketches -- which arent bad - til she gete

MARTY
People in this town drive in a very
counterintuitive manner and that’s what
I have to say

cURT
Do you want to spend the weekend in jail
‘cause wed all like to check out my
cousins country home and not get boned
in the ass by a huge skinhead ‘

JULES
Marty honey that’a not okay

MARTY
Statistical fact cops will never pull
over 4 man with a huge bong in his car
Why They fear this man They know he
sees farther than they and he will bind
them with ancient logics

(staring at Julea’s hair)

Have you gone grey

CURT
You’re not bringing that thing in the
rambler

MARTY

A giant bong in your father’a van

He pours the water out Removes the bow stiches it in a
little holdar inside the tube and telescopes the entire
thing down pulla a lid off the bottom and pops it on the
top making it look exactly like a can of Fresca

MARTY (CONTD)
What are you stonad

As Holden raises bis eyebrows and Jules rolls her eyea
Marty hops in calling out

MARTY (CONT’D)
(from inaide van)
Dana You fetching minx Do you have

It reaches the roof and pana over as wa find a group of
six men in Clean Room Suits eatanding silently After a
beat one speaks into hia earpiece

CLEAN MAN

eatairwell

CLEAN MAN(CONTD)
Go for clean-up Go go go

INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

A thick metal door (not vault-sized but impressive)
wheezes open a military guard standing behind it His
name is Alex TRUMAN and his exact military affiliation
is unclear He is upright exacting and pretty new at
all thia

TRUMAN 3
Identification pleace

REVERSE on Sitterson and Hatley as they pull off their
badges aud ewipe them over Truman’s handheld reader He
confirms

TRUMAN (CONT’D)
Mister Sitterson Mister Hadley thank
you Please come in

The control room has two levels On the lower level are
a couple of tables with built-in monitors and phones

The upper level behind is a wonderland of screens
switches and dials with two rolling chairs for Sitterson
and Hadley to move about in On the far wall over the
lower space are three big screens aleso off The place
resembles a movie mixing stage or a tiny Houston
Control

Hadley and Sitterson make their way up talking with
Truman

HADLEY
What’s your name

TRUMAN
Alex Truman sir

HADLEY
Well this ient the army Truman so you
can drop the “sir” But Sittereon does
like to be called “ma‘am”

SITTERSON
(liding the cooler under a
counter)
Or “Honey Toes”

HADLEY
He will also answer to “Honey Toes Are
you clear on what’s gonna be happening
here

TRUMAN
Ive been prepped extenaively

HADLEY
And did they tell you that being prepped
is not the same as being prepared

TRUMAN
They told me I‘ll hold my post Mister
Hadley I°1l1 see it through

HADLEY

wall that audibly powers up the control room
to hia chair and starts flipping switches there as well

He crosses

JULES
I hope this is the right road ‘cause

CURT

JULES

Doeen’‘t even show on the GPS Its
unworthy of global positioning

DANA
It must feel horrible

MARTY

Markers no traffic cameras go
somewhere for one goddamn weekend where
they can’t globally position my ass
This ia the whole isaue
JULES
(heard this before)
Ie sociaty crumbling Marty

MARTY
Society is binding Its filling in the
cracks with concrete No cracks to slip

We‘re all too chickenshit to let it

JULES

EXTINT GAS STATION

It ie as decrepit and abandoned looking as it can be An
old pump squats in front of a monument to rust windows
clouded with grime

ANGLE FROM INSIDE through the windows wea sea the
rambler pull up Tha inside of this place doesn’t lack

any mor more inviting than the outside Once upon a tine
things ware fixed and goods were agid in here but not of
late

The kids pile out stretching looking about Curt and
Marty examine the pump
CURT
I’m thinking thie thing doesn’t take
eredit cards
MARTY
I don’t think it knows about money I
think it’s barter gas

Curt moves a pace to see if anyone is around

ANGLE HOLDEN ie inside moving slowly toward the back
We hear Curt’s offscreen

CURT
Hello

But no reply Holden keeps walking tracing his finger
along the countertop

CLOSE ON HIS FINGER trailing a line of clear glaee into
the grime

ANGLE THE GIRLS

Because I hate going in the Rambler

DANA
You think the toilet here’s gonna be
better

JULES
I dont like to pee when all my friends
are two feet away from me I’m quirky
At least this hap gotta be HOAH

They stop staring in horror

REVERSE ON THE BATHROOM It’s just as horrible as it
could be The door off the room tiny -- the walls
stained with what might be actual slime The toilet is
lidleses broken and filled with brownish aludge

A weird little gurgle comes from it

Dana moves forward brow furrowed She leana in and
looks down

In the toilet a scorpion struggles drowning in the
fetid muck

ANGLE HOLDEN is heading back outside We’re behind hin
and through the open doorway we can see Curt and Marty
trying to figure out how to work the pump

HOLDEN
I don’t think there’s gonna be any --

The ATTENDANT fills the doorway having come around from
the outeide He apeake as he appears over the surge of
music and dolden’s shocked jump -

ATTENDANT

Spins in the sand and takes the heap right out of there
eruising down the road

The attendant watches spite chaw Watches

EXT WOODS DAY

A helicopter shot floats over the rembler as it winda
through an endless expanse of firs finally consumed by
them

EXT MOUNTAIN TUNNEL - AFTERNOON

The Rambler comes up the side of a steep drop-off We
see Jules in the passenger seat emiling

JULES
Guys take a look

And we pan with the vehicle as it entere the mountain
tunnel slowing down 4 bit -- it’s a tight fit The
camara moves up the mountaineaide looking down to see the
rambler come out the other end

A bird comes from behind camera flying directly above
the tunnel About halfway across it hite an invisible
barrier and falls in a shower of sparks as for one moment
an electrical grid seems to appear where it struck
before sparking away into nothing
RE

EXT CABININTVAN - AFTERNOON

There’s no audio but music as the kida all crowd the
front of the van to look at their vacation spot The
lake appesre up ahead aun rippling over the water and
they look and point talking a bit

Finally the camera races through the forest and finds the
cabin It squats uninvitingly a fairly ramshackle --
though not overly ruatic -- single story structure
Windows on either side of the door not unlike closed
eyes

The van pulla up and the kids come out more alowly than
they did at the gas station taking it in Danas a
little entranced Holden curious Curt pumped Jules
mildly excited Marty wary

JULES
Oh my god it’s beautiful
to Curt sotto voce)
One epider and Im sleeping in the
Rambler I mean it Uno apidar-o

MARTY
(to himself)
Thies houses ie talking a blue streak

As the boys start unloading the keg Dana approaches the
front door alewly turns the knob

INT LIVING ROOM CONTINUOUS

She enters the living room It’s also if you turn to
the right the kitchen the stove is a classic old wood-
burning Kalamazoo Wonder the sink clearly ratro-fitted
The decor is sparse and antlery A wolfs head ia
mounted on one wall

A hall goes own the middle with two bedrooms on either
side Dana makes her way around the room as tha rest of
the gang pours in

CURT
Oh this is awesome

JULES
It ia kinda cool You gonna kill us a
raccoon to eat

CURT

Jules runs down to the hall to look in the rooms
grabbing a doorknob --

JULES
Dibs on whichever room is -- OW

She pulls her finger back -- it’s cut slightly on the
tip a little blood welling up

JULES (CONTD)
Curt your couain’s house attacked me

CURT

CURT
Jules is pre-med She knows there’s no

Dana looks over at Marty who stands in the doorway
looking around warily

DANA
Marty Are you planning on coming in

He looks around not ready to make his move

INT HOLDEN‘’S ROOM AFTERNOON

Holden throws his bag on his bed which squeake
appallingly He looks around the decrepit -- but not
entirely un-homey -- room focusses on a picture opposite
the bed

ANGLE THE PICTURE is like 19th century print but it’s
of a hunting party with machetes and dogs tearing a lamb
to piecea and upon close examination is repulsive

HOLDEN
Yeah I don’t think so
ee te ith

so

He takes the picture off the wall camera follows him as
he leans it on the floor comea back up to find Dana
staring at him blankly through a hole in the wall once
again he jumps

BOLDEN (CONT’D)
Wow I’ve heard about the walls being
thin but --

She bares har teeth at him He stops not getting whats
going on at all then as she starts picking between tham
he gete it Moves forward and puts his hand to the one-
way mirror between then

HOLDEN (CONTD)
No way

He watches her for a bit firat amsaed then a little
hypnotised She really ia kind of beautiful She musees
her hair a little gives up grinning at her own vanity
Moves to her bed and starta unbuttoning her shirt

HOLDEN (CONT’D)
Ch shit ah no abh

Be bobs back and forth betwaen thie golden opportunity
and commen human (yawn) decency Moves away from the
hole out of frame Movea back

Finally bangs on the wall ducking his head just as she‘a
about to take it off --

to her step

While the group hoota and hollers Jules turne around
bends over right in front of the wolf Pretends like

Then without turning around she satanda up straight so
that the wolf is now directly over her shoulder She
nuzzles it cheek to cheek --

JULES (CONTD)

And with that Jules leana in and gives the wolf the most
passionate kies we’ve ever seen She just goes for it -
full-on tongue-to-taxidermied-wolf-tongue action

The group loses their minds Everyone leapa to their
feet giving Jules a standing ovation

Jules looks to the group takes a bow even as she makes a

illuminates three feet in front of her

She reaches the landing Triea to keep her voice steady
ae she calls back to the others --

DANA

She stands at the base of the stairs trains the
flashlight beam around the reom Curiosity getting the
better of her she stepa into the darkness

Craak

The flashlight beam scana tha room catching a glint of oP
metal - OLD RUSTY TOOLS hang from hooks along the walla

Dana keeps moving heart pounding in her chest Her
flashlight sweeps the area finding a duaty old RECORD

MANNEQUIN

Dana turns beam eweeping across the wall As it does
so it finds --

A GHOSTLY FACE

Staring right at her Dana screams nearly jumps out of
her skin --

HOLDEN (0S)
Dana

As footsteps ring out from above Dana angles the light
back towards the face realizes --

It‘s a PORTRAIT A daguerrotype to be precise of a
young woman roughly fifteen dreased in turn of the
cemtury garb She stares back at Dana with sad eyes

HOLDEN (CoNT’D)

Holden looks down at a variety of CHILD’S TOYS scattered
acrosea the floor Ee picks up an ORNATE MUSIC BOX --

HOLDEN
Dude seriously -- your cousin’s into
some weird shit

Curt has picked up a CONCH when he seea a WOODEN SPHERE
sitting behind it He puts the conch down and hoista the
sphere It almost looks like a small globe it’s so
ornately carved but it has dusty brass rings inlaid
around it -- it can be turned and adjusted almost like a
spherical Rubiks cube

CURT
Yeah pretty sure thie ain’t hia Maybe
the people who put in that window

Dana can’t take her syes off the portrait of the girl

On the vanity below it she notices a variety of personal
effects an old hairbrush a silver mirror and a
leather-bound BOOK

DANA

hengs around its neck Jules touchea it

JULES

But even Marty can’t help but be intrigued as he spots an
OLD SUPER-§ PROJECTOR He finds a film reel atarts
unspooling it

HAUNTING MUSIC fille the air as Holden starta winding the
crank on the music box

Curt starts turning the sphere parts -- they seem to be
lining up

Dana brushes the dust off the book revealing the word
“DIARY” on the cover

Jules takes the amulet off the mannequin holds it up to
her neck looka for the clasp -- as though she were about

to try it on

Marty holds the film strip up to the light frowns ag he
tries to discern what’s on it

As Holden continues to wind the crank the mueic BUILDS
and BUILDS He’a staring down at the box-lid -- it’s as
though something’s about te pop right out of it And
just ae the musics about to reach creacendo --

DANA

Bveryone looks up from what they’re doing

And now we cut back and forth a hit

Curt kneeling elides Jules’s pants off His head comes
back into frame and takes the edge of her panties in hia
mouth making 4 little growl as he lets go and it snaps
back on her waist --

Jules laughs leaning her head back and suddenly not
laughing breathing hard

Hadley and Sitterson stare looking perhaps directly
into camera to make us even less comfortable)

Jules swinge on top and pulle her shirt off at last She
takes her time sliding her hands up her belly to her
breasts finally to the clasp in the middle of her bra

She popa it open holding it together coyly for one
moment before pulling the bra off revealing her breasts
a sheen of aweat (and the fact that they‘re not fake)
making them all the more enticing She smiles knowingly
a vision of hedonistic perfection

Curt looks up at her in silent wonder

All three men in the control room - including Truman -
lopk at her the exact sama way

Re Curt slides his hand over her gbest ashe leane down
into him hig arms coming around her back

HADLEY

SITTERSON
Eat that Stockholm

He makes a emall tweak on a dial eyes still on tha

ANGLE ABOVE THE LOVERS the camera comes softly down
towarda them the tableau romantic and sensusl He’a

atop her and a bit to the side one hand cut of frams)
working under her panties as she moans arme out

CLOSE ON HER HAND running along the soft moss
A rusty trowel naile it to the earth

Jules SCREAMS rearing up --- hampered by the hand that
wont move as Curt tumbles off her looking up to see

Three zombies (aa they will be called from now on) are
attacking them

Sus

Skinny JUDAH ia crouching over Jules pulling hia trowel
out even as MOTHER reaches around her neck with her
snaggle-toothed saw MATTHEW the biggest ia still a
few feet behind ambling towards

CLOSE ON THE MOTHER’S BELLY ae three burning coals flop
out of a elit in it sizzling on Julea’s hair and the

She starts to draw the saw along Jules’s neck and Curt
snaps out of it He piledrivea right into Mother -

CURT
Puck away from her

-- knocking her back on her ass He turns to Judah just
as Judah digs the trowel into hie arm Curt howls
trying to pull it out as Jules holde her bleeding neck
trying to rise but weak

Curt pulle his arm away bringing Judah towards him and
then punches Judah hard right in the nose The nose
breaks easily crumbling a bit Judah completely unfazed
by it Curt looks over towards the third zombie

Matthew stands a few feet away leaning elightly
Suddenly he lets a chain slide through his fingers all
the way to the ground pulled by a broken bear-trap just
a rusty metal jaw with teeth a turn-of-the-cantury mace
and chain

Matthew grins

The trap awings with sudden apeed whacking Curt’s head
(luckily not with the jagged side) and knocking him back
bleeding and dazed

JULES
Curt

She tries to rise and Matthew swings again digging the
claw of the trap into her back She SCREAMS arching
back and flopping face-down onto the ground digging her
fingers into the earth as Matthew drags her backwards

Curt atumbles up -- and Father is behind him slipping
the shaft of hia scythe over Curt’s head and pulling it
back hard against Curt’s throat Curt thraehes unable
to acream as hie feet are pulled off the ground He
sees

The screaming pleading whimpering Julea ia kept in
place by Matthew’s foot as he yankea out the trap

Judah pulle her hair back holding up her head -- her
eyes on Curt’s -- as Mother places the broken blade once
more at her throat Curt watchea in silent horror

Inside the control room the men are equally silent
Truman trying hard not to lose it aa Julesa’s pleas fill
the air around

CLOSE ON JULES’S PLEADING EYES as we hear the horrible
scrape of the saw tearing flash

No sound in the conaole at all save scraping and
ehuffling Truman has his eyes closed Hadley and
Sitterson hoth have lowered their heads and Sitterson
quietly intones

SITTERSON
This we offer in humility and fear for
the bleased peace of your eternal
elumber As it ever was

HADLEY
As it evar was

Sitterson pulla a short necklace from under his shirt
Qn it is a weird pagan symbol five pointed but not a
pentagram He kissea it and replaces it under his shirt
as Hadley croases behind him to a series of five mahogany
panele at the far end of the room

He opens the first and presses an ornate brase lever
down

CLOSE ON A MECHANISM almost like an old clock Jules
Verne-eeque A small hammer strikes a vial that cracke
dark red blood pouring out into a brass funnel that runs
down a thin pipe seemingly a vary long way

INT THE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

The pipe ends in the ceiling of a dark room we won’t
really saa just yet The blood poura out onto a leaning
slab of dark marble right into a groove at the top The
blood races down the groove as it bends and arce
different ways forming a primitive picture of some aort
- though of what we do not yet see

Judah hisses at us

Drop wide to see Curt haa stopped struggling Pather
atill holding him as Judah and Mother amble toward him
Matthew is bent over Jules’s corpse but we cant aes
what hes doing thankfully

As they raise their blades Curt springs into action
planting hia feet on both of them and pushing as hard aa
he can knocking them back -- and Father as well Curt
rolling over him and pulling himself free

Gaeping for breath Curt scrambles on hands and knees
back towards the cabin almost on his feet -- and the
blade of Father’s scythe slices through the cuff of his
jeane pulling his leg and dropping him back to earth

tight you might not even tell

Dana is leaning againat the glase when the elevator
suddenly comes abreast of another elavator alao with a
thick glass wall and stops --

a ravenous WEREWOLF leape at her as she turns -- she
jumps back as it hita the glass clawing at it and
drooling Marty satares in incomprehension

MARTY (CONT‘D
SO nO

Both of them press up against the opposite wall -- and
the elevator moves sideways again revealing a Gigeresque
ALIEN hanging from the ceiling behind them It jumps
ento the glass and sticks there freaking them out again
making them move to the middie of the amall apace
looking around for the naxt horror

The elevator is jerked down - then sideways revealing
this time one on each side Dana sees

A little girl in a ragged ballerina outfit not a tutu
but a limp torn skirt) She has no face just a circla
mouth with a ring of teeth

Marty sees

A staring man in a long leather futuristic coat He’s
dead white hag no hair and buzzsaws stuck in his head in
a nmeat row His arms are ringed with barbed wire etuck
in deep Se is grinning at Marty and holding a flowing
sphere almost exactly the same as the one in the cellar

camera circling them as they turn looking at the five
stone slabs then arming ap to aee they‘re standing on a
mosaic of the symbol Sitterson wora

Except At the otaire the sdyes of the stone don’t reach
the wall The two of them look aver tha edgw to saa a
space of maybe four feet across that goes all the way
down into darxXness Aut there is the sense of somsthing
moving in that darkness The kids draw back from it

MARTY
No way out

DANA
Look at these

Five of then

MARTY

DANA

A whirring sound accompanies a spill of light as a small
circular hatch opena in the center of the mosaic and up
comes THE DIRECTOR (kind of like Luke in “Empire” when he
entere the cryogenic chamber to fight Vader)

He is older distinguished wearing a black suit grey
ehirt no collar no tie and grey gloves Hea calm
almost affectionate

trying to pull the beast off her

The Director and Marty both move for the gun and
struggle themselves but Marty finally geta hold of it --

hesitation puts three bullets into the werewolf sending
it screeching back up the stairs

Dana rolls over eyes wild blood everywhere The
Director rises and tackles Marty They wrestle on the
floor the gun just out of reach the edge of the abyss
by their heads

As they fight Dana breathes heavily by the ptairs
unable to rise She looks over as two amall feet shamble

gingham dresa swinging above the ankles

Marty gets on top of The Directox and pushes his forearm
against his windpipe His back is to the girl

The Director on top of him just as Patience swinge her
hatchet burying it in the back of the Directors ekull

Another tremor and Marty kicks The Director over the edge
of the circle Patience unwilling to let go her
hatchet goes over with him

Marty watchea them a moment then limps over to the
stairs

Another bigger tremor makes him pause but it subsides
and he slumps in thea corner next to Dana She‘s
breathing shallow tears streaming from her eyes but
shes pretty alert
