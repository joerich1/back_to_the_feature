FADE IN

INT MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Someone’s taking a very hot shower Steam on glass obscures
the athletic form of a woman

She’s crying hard Deep inside the hazy veil of mist

GOLDIE (20s) hugs herself and weeps Wet blonde hair clings
to her quivering shoulders She sports a fresh fat lip

Dark and deep bruises on her forearms shine purple
Water masks the battered woman’s tears

Blood ebbs out of gashes on her calves and thighs The pink
liquid pools at her feet then drains

Goldie balls up her fists covers her eyes

She wails like a grieving mother Goldie crumples in a heap
on the wet tiles and cries hard

GOLDIE (V0O)
Most days I feel like a busted
doll no one wants

Standing naked before a foggy rectangular MIRROR Goldie
grabs a SUTURE KIT She pushes the curved needle through her
flesh then stitches up a gash on her thigh

GOLDIE (VO)
You can wind me up point me in any
direction you please and watch me
perform Until I break down again

Loop after loop of catgut slowly closes the hole She pulls
the suture taut knots the wound shut

INT WALK-IN CLOSET - DAY

Expensive dresses surround Goldie

GOLDIE (VO)
But I won’t give up on my dreams

She pulls a cheap blue and white tank top over her head The
cotton fabric hugs her muscled curves

An old leather belt cinches up cargo pants Thick double-
knotted laces dangle from each of her hiking boots
INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

It’s a post-modern open space No walls in this rectangular
low-rise GLASS HOUSE wrapped in steel

FAMILY PORTRAITS cover the top of a long bureau
GOLDIE (V0O)
Ever since I was a little girl
I’ve wanted to find a family I
could call my very own

In the images Loving parents hug and flank their blonde
toddler Mother Father and Daughter look so happy together

None of the photos feature Goldie

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Sunlight pours in through the floor-to-ceiling high windows
overlooking the lush FOREST

GOLDIE (VO)
To live forever in a special place
where I was wanted And everything
around me was just right

A clean table’s set for three A steaming bowl of PORRIDGE
cools in front of each perfectly straight place mat

One of the chairs is on its side and missing a leg Ona
shelf there’s an overturned KNIFE BLOCK speckled with BLOODY
HAND PRINTS More crimson smears across the white cabinets

Goldie sits She leans forward inhales the aroma Her long
blonde hair flanks the bowl of porridge

She holds a big wooden spoon in her hand Her swollen
knuckles are raw and red

Goldie eats and eats and eats Until she pushes the empty
bowl aside then grabs the next full one

A glob of hot porridge lands on the bloody floor

She scoops up the dirty slop with her fingers gulps down the
thick gruel fast Her fresh fat lip oozes blood

One heaping spoonful of porridge after another disappears
into her maw Goldie never blinks once

This is not the Goldilocks you know from fairy tales

The bowls are empty One by one Goldie pushes each chair
back into place

Until everything is just right

Goldie grabs a full BACKPACK off a shelf There’s a TEDDY
BEAR peeking out the open top She smiles at the stuffed toy
kisses his button nose then pulls out something else

A heart-shaped GOLD LOCKET dangles on a chain Goldie puts on
the necklace The cheap heart nestles between her breasts

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
Signs of a bloody violent struggle everywhere

Overturned tables Downed bookshelves Shattered vases on the
varnished hardwood floor

BLOODY PALM PRINTS dot the glass wall The horrific finger
painting suggests multiple people were involved

GOLDIE (VO)
It’s not easy to make your dreams
come true It takes a lot of hard
work and determination And trust
me they’ll be lots of setbacks
along the way

Goldie ignores the bloody chaos sits cross-legged on the
hardwood floor of the ravaged home

She looks at a smashed family portrait Shattered glass
covers the stilted smiles Goldie throws away the image

GOLDIE (VO)
I don’t know why people lie to
themselves I can see as plain as
day they’re not happy I try to
help them but they don’t want to
listen Until it’s too late

There’s a busted coffee table near Goldie Blood pools over
the glass shards Two teeth lodged in the red soup

Nearby there’s a closed LAPTOP Goldie sorts through a stack
of mail between her legs She rips open an envelope

Inside there’s a homemade housewarming greeting card with an
adorable family photo glued on the cover

It’s another family of three with a blonde little girl

GOLDIE (VO)
I know deep down in my heart that
the right family for me has to be
out there Somewhere

All those big smiles seduce Goldie It’s a perfect photo
that’s screaming for a Facebook post Goldie reads the
handwritten inscription aloud

GOLDIE
From our family to yours Wishing
you many happy years together in
your new dream home

She stares at the photo fixates on the family Goldie
obsesses over every curve of their perfect faces

GOLDIE (VO)
I gotta try to stay positive and
not dwell on the past And be open
to new opportunities

Goldie looks at the return address it’s in California She
grabs the laptop The cracked screen flickers to life

She types the return address into a search engine Goldie
looks up the residence on Google Earth

GOLDIE (VO)
I won’t give up hope I’1l keep
looking for my dream home

It’s an idyllic LAKE HOUSE in the woods Goldie keys the
sender’s name into the search engine SARA BERENSON

She’s a non-fiction writer True crime A one hit wonder
actually Sara wrote just one killer best seller

Girl in a Box Dissection of a Psychopath Goldie clicks a
link reads a book review aloud

GOLDIE
You won’t be able to forget Sara
Berenson’s insights into a broken
mind no matter how hard you try

Goldie grins She’s borderline euphoric like she just won
the lottery and it’s time to claim her prize

GOLDIE (VO)
The perfect family and the perfect
writer to tell my story Sara
Berenson you’re gonna be my
happily ever after
KITCHEN

Goldie opens the MICROWAVE She stuffs the laptop and a stack
of mobile devices into the chamber Goldie sets the timer for
an hour then presses start

The microwave beeps and hums to life Goldie leaves

Cell phones laptops and tablets rotate It doesn’t take long
for them to crackle and bubble

An iPhone shudders and pops like a bloated tick What’s left
of the laptop melts in the microwave

Sparks flit across the chamber The radiated motherboard pops
and dances Circuits sizzle

The microwave EXPLODES The door flies open Balls of flaming
plastic spew out The entire kitchen starts to burn
EXT GLASS HOUSE - DAY

Goldie exits through oversized oak double doors They clunk
shut behind her

She strides down the driveway Goldie passes an Audi Q7 SUV
with flat tires and a shattered passenger window

Dried blood cakes the closed door Someone got pulled out
that broken window by force The dented hood’s up too A
tangle of severed wires hang over the SUV’s fender

Goldie walks beyond the carnage She shoulders the backpack
leaves behind what’s left of the glass low-rise

The TEDDY BEAR head-bobbles in the backpack The GROWL of a
large animal freezes Goldie in her tracks

It’s a huge blood-stained WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD His muzzle’s
splattered with fresh gore wounds all over his torso

The canine glares at Goldie with dark amber eyes The big
white dog growls louder and louder until

GOLDIE
Grimm platz

The hulking shepherd blinks then drops on his belly and
pants like a tuckered out puppy

GOLDIE
Braver hund So ist brave
GRIMM wags his long ivory tail whines up at Goldie He paws
at his bloody face There’s something stuck in his jaw

Goldie drops to her knees comforts her submissive pooch She
reaches into Grimm’s throat pulls out something

It’s a chunk of SAFETY GLASS probably from the Audi Grimm
licks Goldie’s face She muzzle-kisses her pal

GOLDIE
Come on boy It’s time to pay our
final respects

EXT FOREST - DAY

A secluded shady spot The thick green canopy hides this
place well Goldie and Grimm push branches aside reveal

THREE SHALLOW GRAVES

All filled in Two adult-sized the last one just the right
size for a little blonde girl

Goldie smiles down at the smallest mound of earth She pulls
the Teddy Bear out of the backpack

The bear’s torso is speckled with BLOOD Goldie gently sets
the stuffed toy on the child’s grave She kisses the dirt
then whispers

GOLDIE
Sweet dreams Baby Bear

A moment of silence then Goldie rises to her feet She wipes
the dirt off her knees walks away from the graves

Grimm watches her leave then lifts his leg and pisses on the
kid’s grave The shepherd kicks up dirt with his hind paws

GOLDIE (0S)
Grimm komm

Goldie hums a happy tune An unseen Grimm barks She hops
over a tree root yells

GOLDIE
Eile Grimm Elie Our happy ending
ain’t gonna write itself

Grimm catches up to his mistress Goldie runs ahead The dog
yips and barks then trots after her Grimm loves this game

Beauty and her beast disappear into the forest
EXT FOREST - DAY

The landscape’s smothered in a thick canopy of trees The
distant rumble of a CHAINSAW echoes through the valley

GOLDIE (VO)
In every fairy tale I’ve ever read
the hero has to find their own path
to make their dreams come true

The blade of a MACHETE cleaves thick branches in half Goldie
steps out of the woods into the sunlight

GOLDIE (VO)
And I’m no different

Goldie smiles She admires the majestic view looks down at
the rolling hills and green flatlands

In the sunny distance there’s a LOGGING CAMP More chainsaws
BUZZ down in the lush emerald valley

Grimm stands next to Goldie He sniffs licks his chops

GOLDIE
What do you smell

EXT WOODSMEN LODGE - NIGHT

There’s an Old West HITCHING POST out front for horses But
the only beast tethered to the log right now is Grimm

The white shepherd lays in front of a bowlful of juicy RIBEYE
STEAKS Grimm gleefully strips red flesh off the bones

GOLDIE (VO)
But you won’t get too far on your
quest with an empty stomach

A temporary saloon in the woods The rundown shanty’s a hodge-
podge of multi-colored corrugated metal It’s the only “bar”
these LOGGERS can get to while stuck on a remote work site

A pair of CROSSED CHAINSAWS preside over the entrance Their
shiny blades clash over the heads of entering patrons

Off-duty workers park their ATVs around the bar The earth’s
rough and muddy just like the loggers

Most guys are still in their dirty WORK GEAR Some brandish
an AXE others have a chainsaw slung over their shoulder All
of them wear safety orange chaps and heavy work boots
Somewhere behind the bar the ROAR of gas engines and the
CHEERS of men fill the night Who are they cheering for

PETER (20s) has got to know There’s an AXE slung over his
broad shoulder He notices Grimm The dog growls at him

Peter grins down at the white shepherd his hand rests on the
wooden handle of his trusty axe

PETER
What’s all the fuss about boy

BEHIND THE LODGE

Portable lights shine on a MASSIVE TREE TRUNK horizontally
laying in a V-shaped LOG STAND It’s as long as a car and at
least two feet thick

Goldie wearing SAFETY CHAPS wields a large customized
CHAINSAW The engine’s big enough for a dirt bike The chrome
exhaust pipe looks like it was stolen from a crotch rocket

Dozens of loggers watch Goldie pull-start the saw The engine
roars to life like a hand-held motorcycle Goldie guns the
throttle filets the log in seconds

She pulls up on the saw slices through a second section of
the wood Then down again powering another slice off as the
exhaust spews smoky flames

The drunk and horny loggers cheer for Goldie Most of them
spill their beer and don’t even care

The woodsmen can’t take their eyes off of Goldie Or the wood
chips clinging to her sweaty tank top Especially Peter

INT WOODSMEN LODGE - NIGHT

Rusty axes and busted chainsaws memorialize generations of
the dead on the walls Drop lights wrapped around vintage
bear traps hang from the ceiling like makeshift chandeliers

Loggers crowd the bar jostle for position A fight breaks
out Fists are thrown beers fly and someone hits the floor

In a corner Peter and Goldie sit alone There’s a dozen
overturned shot glasses in front of them Just two swallows
of whisky left

Goldie and Peter pick up their last shots down them The
pair stare at each other until
PETER
So where are you headed

GOLDIE
To visit a friend

PETER
Is she a fun friend
GOLDIE
No
PETER

Then why are you going to see her

GOLDIE
Because she needs my help Bad

PETER
What’s her problem

GOLDIE
You don’t want to know

PETER
Sure I do Come on Tell me

GOLDIE
If I tell you about her I might
have to gut you later

Peter plays along with the “joke” He rubs his matted beard
mock-ponders his options

PETER
Ill take that chance

Goldie grins wide at Peter

EXT LAKE HOUSE - DAY

A contemporary home with too many windows The logs embedded
in the exterior walls are ornamental not practical

Solar panels on the roof soak up the morning sun
Next to a wooden dock a family of DUCKS quack

Set back from the house is a half-built GUEST COTTAGE The
work site’s shrouded in thick opaque plastic

INT LAKE HOUSE - DAY
A much more cozy home than the open space glass structure

The picture window affords a sparkling view of the lake A
fire crackles in the stone-wrapped hearth

Idyllic family portraits clutter the wall It’s the same
family from the greeting card that Goldie found

INT LAKE HOUSE - STUDY - DAY

Overstuffed bookshelves fill the space There’s a poster for
Girl in a Box Dissection of a Psychopath on the wall

An old sofa sits under a picture window overlooking the lush
green forest All that literature surrounds a modest wooden
desk that’s pushed into a dark corner

SARA (30s) runs her hand through her blonde hair She sighs
talks to an OLDER WOMAN on her SMARTPHONE

SARA
Lily I’m not being unreasonable
The paperback sales alone--

LILY (VO)
Are through the floor now It’s
been too long since Girl in a Box
Youre out of circulation Sara

Around Sara’s feet a BLACK CAT mews She ignores the feline

SARA
Give me another extension I know I
can finish the new book I just
need a little more time

LILY (VO)
As your agent and your friend I’m
advising you to give the cash
advance back to the publisher

SARA
I used it all to finance Todd’s new
office We can’t even afford to
finish the guest cottage It looks
like a plastic-wrapped nightmare

LILY (VO)
We had a good run So don’t take
it personally when I tell you that
your viability as a client is shit

SARA
I know it’s a lot of money Lily
but after the Architectural Digest
feature comes out clients will be
lining up to hire Todd

LILY (VO)
Want some unsolicited advice from
your soon to be ex-agent

SARA
Sure

LILY (V0O)
Go make a wish list Five things
you want to change about yourself

SARA
Five things What kind of things

LILY (VO)
Anything you want

SARA
OK then what

LILY
Then fucking burn it because
wishes are for losers And no one’s
gonna wave a magic wand over your
career and save it Sara
Lily hangs up

Sara stares at the dormant screen of her MACBOOK PRO It
looks like a black mirror

She jiggles the mouse The black mirror turns into a white
hot blank page Sara stares at the blinding screen

EXT LAKE HOUSE - DAY

A grassy hilltop overlooks the property High above the home
something reflects sunlight

EXT HILLTOP - DAY

Thick trees obscure the reflection’s source

Goldie’s laying on her stomach watching the Lake House
through BINOCULARS All her wounds have healed Grimm’s too

The sleeping shepherd lays on his back His big hind paws
splayed wide apart exposing Grimm’s soft pink belly

There’s an open NOTEBOOK by Goldie’s side It’s a spreadsheet
of Sara’s movements lots and lots of entries

GOLDIE (VO)
Every day for the last three weeks

Sara goes for an agonizingly long
bike ride right about now

EXT LAKE HOUSE - DAY
Sara exits the house in spandex shorts and a tank top

She straps on her helmet then hops on a MOUNTAIN BIKE Sara
pedals down a secluded TRAIL into the thick wilderness

GOLDIE (VO)
Which makes it much easier for me
to get to know her better So when
Sara and I finally meet everything
will be just right

High above Goldie watches Sara leave

GOLDIE
Grimm achtung

Grimm’s dark amber eyes blink open The big white dog sits
next to his mistress pants Goldie pets his ivory muzzle

GOLDIE
Bleip Grimm

The dog sits on his haunches watches Goldie walk away She
sniffs her armpits Yikes it’s shower time
INT LAKE HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY

Goldie rinses lather off her body in the shower She hums a
happy tune to herself

Foamy waves of soap cascade down her scarred thighs She
leans her head back washes shampoo out of her blonde locks

LATER

A dry and dressed Goldie wipes down the shower stall with a
towel until all the moisture and fingerprints are gone

PANTRY
Goldie throws the wet towel into the dryer

She closes the door selects a cycle and starts the machine
without even looking at the device

Goldie inspects the non-perishable food on the shelves She
opens a box of cereal pours grainy flakes into her mouth

KITCHEN

Goldie stands in front of the open refrigerator guzzles milk
straight from the jug She eyeballs a package of HOT DOGS

STUDY

Goldie sits at Sara’s desk in front of the MACBOOK PRO She
cracks her knuckles settles into the leather chair

She types a password unlocks the laptop Front and center is
the last thing Sara worked on

GOLDIE (VO)
A wish list

Goldie gets more and more excited as she reads each item on
the wish list aloud

GOLDIE
Number one Be open to new
opportunities to better myself

GOLDIE (VO)
That’s my number one too I knew
it Sara and I are so much alike

GOLDIE
Number two Be strong for my
daughter Number three Be faithful
to my husband Number four Make a
new friend Someone I can really
talk to and trust

Tears well up in Goldie’s eyes She touches the screen her
fingertips graze each and every digital letter

GOLDIE (VO)

And number five I can’t even say
out loud My lips won’t work
Number five Write a killer book
and save my family

LATER

Cargo shorts down around her ankles Goldie sits in front of
the MacBook Pro She masturbates to a video

Slender digits slide up and down between her legs Goldie
watches the screen She croaks out a long moan

On screen A fun family outing in the lake
Sara looks so happy with her husband and daughter The little
girl wears inflatable rings around her arms She dog-paddles
splashes her mother Sara pretends to be wounded
GOLDIE (VO)

Sara’s a great mom I wish I had

her patience with kids I know once

she trusts me we can learn so much

from each other

Goldie moans louder The rubber soles of her hiking boots
writhe and squeak on the polished hardwood floor

On screen The young blonde girl hugs Sara tight

DAUGHTER (VO)
I love you Mommy

SARA (VO)
I love you too

Goldie taps the space bar pauses the video She fixates on
the frozen embrace Goldie pleasures herself until

She shudders and climaxes Goldie pants out the words
GOLDIE

I love you too Mama Bear
LATER - NIGHT
RICK (30s) stands tall He pistons his chiseled sweaty torso
against a naked Sara But he’s not the husband in the family
photos throughout the house
Each thrust drives her body against the cold glass further
warps the cold expression on Sara’s face

EXT HILLTOP - NIGHT

Goldie focuses the binoculars She watches Sara and Rick have
sex against the glass

GOLDIE (VO)
And who do we have here

Next to her Grimm snores

The dog sleeps rolls over onto an empty plastic wrapper that
looks familiar It’s Sara’s package of HOT DOGS

GOLDIE (VO)
Number three Be faithful to my
husband Wishes don’t happen by
themselves Sara You have to want
it more than anything in the world
It all starts with you

INT LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

Sara wraps a white blanket around her naked body pours
herself a glass of wine

Rick buttons his shirt

SARA
Tonight was the last time

RICK
You just came three times in a row

SARA
I wasn’t counting

RICK
We’re the only two houses on the
lake Don’t ruin a good thing

SARA
I don’t feel good Please leave

RICK
If you’re not nice to me I won’t
fix your speeding tickets for you

Rick grabs his wallet off the coffee table He opens the
leather waves the GOLD BADGE in Sara’s face and grins

SARA
Goodbye Rick

He chuckles then sees himself out

Sara leans against her reflection in the head-to-toe length
window The opposing “faces” look down at the floor

INT LAKE HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sara takes a hot shower She scrubs herself hard drops the
soap She starts to cry hugs herself

From across the steamy room Goldie watches Sara weep She
head-tilts watches Sara cry and sit down on the wet tile
her back to Goldie

Sara doesn’t see Goldie caress the glass Like someone does
when visiting a loved one in prison they can’t touch

Steam billows obscures both women from view

Sara stands up turns off the water She slides open the
glass door The steam dissipates

Goldie’s gone

EXT THE WOODS - BIKE TRAIL - NEXT DAY

Sara clad in tight spandex pedals the mountain bike She
shifts gears charges a gnarly hill

Knobby tires hop over an exposed tree root STORM CLOUDS
gather over the distant Lake House

INT LAKE HOUSE - STUDY - DAY
Goldie double-clicks a folder labeled “MANUSCRIPTS”

GOLDIE
OK Let’s see how much progress
weve made today

On screen Not many pages in the selected text document

Far too few to be even close to finishing a chapter let
alone an entire book

GOLDIE (VO)
Sara hasn’t written a word since
I’ve got here She needs me even
more than I could’ve imag--

The Black Cat shrieks under the desk JUMP-SCARES Goldie The
feline claws at her exposed ankle

Goldie screams kicks the desk hard The cat hisses then
flees through the open door Goldie inspects the fresh deep
scratch winces in pain

She pumps HAND SANITIZER into her hand from a bottle The
clear gel gathers in her palm Goldie psychs herself up then
slaps the hand sanitizer on the wound She grunts in pain
GOLDIE
(to herself)
I’m gonna feed you to my doggie
first chance I get you fucker
EXT LAKE HOUSE - DAY
A HARD RAIN falls punctuated by thunder

Sara coasts to a stop on the bike She notices the back
door’s wide open Sara slowly approaches the house

SARA
Hello Rick
INT LAKE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Sara closes the back door behind her looks around

Someone’s been sitting at the dinner table The chair’s still
pulled out as if they left in a hurry

Thunder rumbles Rain drops pelt windows

Something moves behind the closed PANTRY door Sara slowly
approaches the wooden KNIFE BLOCK grabs a BUTCHER KNIFE

Sara approaches the pantry

SARA
Is that you kitty

Under the door frame she notices a SHADOW Knife held high
Sara holds her breath then opens the pantry door

A can of peaches sits on the floor Sara exhales in relief
backs into a shelf The cereal box Goldie ate from falls
JUMP-SCARES the daylights out of Sara

SARA
Shit Fucking Corn Flakes

The ceiling CREAKS Sara half-caught that The intense
downpour drowns out most of the sound

She cranes her neck listens for a while

There it is again The sound spooks Sara She looks up at the
ceiling
DEN

Sara walks through the space looks UPSTAIRS She summons all
her courage

SARA
Rick Is that you

She waits for an answer that never comes Sara climbs the
creaky steps One by one
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

At the end of the corridor a door creaks open The sounds of
wind and rustling trees echo down the hallway

Sara presses her back against the wall grips the knife The
blade gleams just below her pale throat

Inching towards the cracked door Sara reaches out for the
knob She pushes the door open The old wood groans The door
opens just enough for Sara to see

The bed’s been slept in Who’s been sleeping in my bed

Sara notices an open window The wind gusts White curtains
flutter around the escape route Sara looks around outside

No sign of anyone She looks up Nobody on the roof

SARA
Stay away from me Rick

Sara scans the dense tree line no signs of an intruder
anywhere Sara hugs herself then closes the window
EXT BIKE TRAIL - NEXT DAY

Sara pilots the mountain bike up an incline She downshifts
then pumps her legs hard

A clearing ahead She crests a hill stops at the top

Sara dismounts the bike and catches her breath She takes a
long drink from a water bottle

In the dense TREE LINE someone watches Sara

There’s more than one They move around in the darkness

Sara looks back from where she came The Lake House is just a
small dot now

A branch SNAPS spooks Sara She pivots looks around A
shadow moves in the tree line

SARA
Hello

Another unseen twig breaks Fear grips Sara by the throat

SARA
Who’s out there

She slowly backs up towards the mountain bike her eyes
always scanning the tree line

That’s why she doesn’t see someone standing behind her

Sara backs into that someone She screams JUMP-SCARES
herself Sara spins around

She retreats from PETER the Woodsmen He’s dressed head to
toe in hunting camo gear and thick boots to match

Peter strokes his matted beard leers at Sara

PETER
Easy now What’s the fuss ma’am

SARA
Someone’s following me

Sara points at the tree line Peter laughs spits chewing
tobacco on the ground then yells

PETER
Come on out boys

Three more BEARISH and BEARDED HUNTERS step out They hold
their rifles stare at Sara in her tight spandex

PETER
See Nothing to worry about We’re
all friends here

Peter and the three bears flank Sara

SARA
What’re you doing out here

PETER
We’re on the hunt for some young
does Right boys

The three hunter bears have a good chuckle One of them
blocks Sara’s path to the bike

SARA
It’s breeding season for deer You
can’t hunt here

PETER
Oh I got myself a special permit

SARA
I don’t believe you

PETER
You wanna see it I don’t know
Whaddya think boys

The Hunters glare at Sara One of them plays with her hair

PETER
Should I whip out my special permit
for the pretty lady

SARA
I don’t want any trouble

PETER
You live in that lake house all by
yourself don’t you

SARA
I’m a married woman

PETER
Sure you are Must get real quiet
on that lake at night All by your
lonesome in the woods No man
around to protect you

Peter adjusts his crotch then rubs his musky thumb back and
forth over Sara’s lips

PETER
Maybe I’1l pay you a visit one
night and rut you like the doe in
heat that you are You’d like that
wouldn’t you

Sara backs into a Hunter Peter grabs her shoulders Sara
quivers in his tight grip

PETER
Say “I want you to rut me like the
doe in heat that I am” Say it And
maybe I’1l let you scurry on home

One of the Hunters gropes Sara’s breasts from behind Peter
grabs her by the throat poised to squeeze much harder

PETER
Say it Say it Say i--
SARA
I wa want you to r ru--

Sara can barely manage syllables Peter spits as he shout-
whispers into her ear

PETER
Rut me Say it like you mean it

Sara shakes her head no then starts to cry She knows what’s
gonna happen to her if she says those words--

GOLDIE (0OS)
Sara Is that you

Peter and the three hunters spin around Goldie sits on a
mountain bike It’s very similar to Sara’s model

Eyes wide with hope Sara pushes past the men She doesn’t
recognize Goldie but smiles and waves at her

GOLDIE
Where have you been

SARA
I got lost on the trail

GOLDIE
Everyone’s back at the house
waiting Come on You don’t want to
be late for your own birthday
party Do you

SARA
No I don’t

Sara stares at Peter then hops on her bike She starts to
pedal down the trail towards home Goldie follows her

PETER
Happy Birthday Sara Ill come pay
you that visit real soon

The trio of Hunters share a big laugh

Goldie lags behind Sara grins and winks at Peter He sticks
his tongue out at her waves goodbye

GOLDIE (VO)

I know I shouldn’t of involved
Peter and the three beards but I
was drunk He was into me I was
into his night vision goggles
don’t judge

EXT BIKE TRAIL - DAY
The Hunters’ cackles echo down the natural corridor

Sara and Goldie pilot their bikes The two ladies pedal side
by side down the trail

GOLDIE (VO)
Besides you heard what I said I
told Peter what would happen if he
knew about Sara But no he didn’t
listen to me They never do You’re
the only one that ever does

INT WOODSMEN LODGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Goldie and Peter stare at their fleet of empty shot glasses
then into each others’ eyes

PETER
Sounds like your unfun friend needs
some sense scared into her

GOLDIE
Maybe Are you a scary guy Peter

PETER
I can be for the right woman

Peter drunkenly smiles at Goldie

GOLDIE (VO)

And that’s when it hit me The best
way to meet Sara is by showing her
how much worse her life would be
without me in it What better way
to make a new friend

EXT BIKE TRAIL - DAY
Goldie catches up to Sara The two women share a smile

SARA
Thank you You just saved my life

GOLDIE
You’re welcome Looks like there’s
a storm headed our way

SARA
Follow me My place is nearby

In the distance STORM CLOUDS gather around the Lake House

INT LAKE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Rain pelts the roof The storm’s here to stay

Goldie sits at the KITCHEN table She leans back props up
her right ankle on another chair

Sara checks the ankle Goldie winces

SARA
What happened

GOLDIE (VO)
Sprained it this morning jumping
out of your bedroom window

But Goldie doesn’t say that aloud

GOLDIE
I caught a rock at a bad angle
after I saw those backwoods fucks
circle-jerking around you

SARA
Let me take a look

Sara pulls an ACE BANDAGE out of a drawer

Goldie enjoys being tended to Sara wraps the injured ankle
in silence until she asks an awkward question

SARA
I’m sorry I hate to ask but where
have we met before Do you live
around here

Goldie stares at Sara poker-faced

SARA
I’ve felt like a total ass for the
last thirty minutes

GOLDIE
Why

SARA
I have a confession to make I
can’t remember your name

Sara laughs a nervous chuckle Goldie laughs too

GOLDIE
That’s because we’ve never met

SARA
Then how did you know my name

GOLDIE
I have a confession to make too

DEN

Heavy rain still falls Goldie sits on the sofa her sprained
ankle propped up on a soft cushion

Goldie finishes drying her hair with a towel then reaches
into her BACKPACK on the coffee table

She pulls out a dog-eared paperback copy of Sara’s book Girl
in a Box Dissection of a Psychopath The spine’s cracked

As if the pages have been read a hundred times Even though
Goldie had never even heard of Sara until two months ago

SARA
Youre a fan How the hell did you
get this address It’s private

GOLDIE
My friend gave it to me Your
husband designed her new home

SARA
You mean Todd’s glass house

GOLDIE
Yes I was crazy about it and then
she showed me that gorgeous picture
of you and your family What a
truly perfect moment You three
look so happy together

Goldie’s “sincerity” catches Sara off guard

GOLDIE
I snuck a peek at the return
address on the envelope I’m sorry
I know I shouldn’t have come here
and invaded your privacy

SARA
No you shouldnt have

Sara finishes wrapping Goldie’s ankle The two women sit in
silence for a moment

They stare at each other until

SARA
But I’m incredibly grateful that
you did Goldie

GOLDIE
Thanks that means a lot to me to
hear you say that I’m really sorry
for barging into your life I had
no right but I think this meeting
happened for a reason

Thunder booms outside The downpour intensifies Goldie pulls
a folded ENVELOPE out of her pocket sets it on the table

SARA
What is that

GOLDIE
It’s your next best seller

Sara sighs

SARA
Look I appreciate what you did for
me today but my agent--

GOLDIE
I know this story can help us both

SARA
I’m really sorry I can’t accept
unsolicited material

GOLDIE
But we’re friends now aren’t we I
just saved your life Sara You
said so yourself

SARA
The truth is I can’t take on any
new projects I’ve got so many
ideas brewing and my new book will
be coming out very soon

GOLDIE (VO)
Liar liar pants on fire

GOLDIE
I see Congratulations

SARA
Thank you

GOLDIE (VO)
How could she reject us We
followed all the fairy tale rules
I saved the fucking damsel in
distress Where’s my wish

Sara’s SMARTPHONE chimes spooks her She reads the message
sighs Sara types a quick response then puts the cell down
on the coffee table in front of Goldie

SARA
Excuse me Would you like a glass
of wine before you go

GOLDIE
Sure Thanks

Goldie puts on a smile Sara leaves Goldie’s face screws up
in frustration Until she fixates on Sara’s phone

GOLDIE (VO)
Wish number one Always be open to
new opportunities

She picks up the phone scrolls through the recent activity
then grins It’s a bunch of texts from Rick

RICK I want you right now

SARA Go away You and I are done
RICK I say when we’re done

SARA Leave me alone

SARA (0S)
(yells from kitchen)
White or red

GOLDIE
(yells into kitchen)
Red The darker the better
Goldie types with her thumbs Come over tonight and ass-—fuck

me against that glass until I beg for mercy

Sara’s approaching footsteps click across the hardwood

Goldie deletes her reply from Sara’s message history She
puts the smartphone back on the coffee table Just before

Sara returns with the wine

GOLDIE

So what’s the plot of your book
SARA

I really can’t tell you what it’s

about yet

GOLDIE (VO)
Id say it’s about three fucking
pages Sara Why do they always
have to lie Now she’ll probably
change the subject

SARA
How’s your ankle Do you live in
town I can give you a ride--

GOLDIE
Forget it I can see now that I
made a mistake coming here and
opening up to you

SARA
Excuse me You’re the stalker here
Not me

GOLDIE

I know but it’s raining--

SARA
Get out of my house Now

Sara opens the front door watches the heavy rain pour The
women stare at each other Goldie slides her boots on winces
in pain She hobbles up to Sara gets in her face

GOLDIE
I should’ve let them rape you

Goldie limps out of the house Sara shuts the door leans

against the barrier She exhales in relief

Sara notices Goldie’s ENVELOPE on the coffee table She picks
up the sealed document tosses it in a WASTE BASKET

EXT HILLTOP - NIGHT

A dry Grimm lays under a tree yawns

Rain pours down on Goldie She stands tall trains the wet
binoculars on the Lake House below

INT LAKE HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT

Sara lounges on the couch drinks wine She ponders Goldie’s
envelope that’s sticking out of the waste basket

Until there’s a KNOCK at the front door Sara looks at the
time It’s almost midnight More knocks harder this time

Could that psycho be back Sara notices the steel deadbolt’s
UNLOCKED She grabs the metal CORKSCREW

Sara inches towards the door

SARA
Who is it

No answer
SARA
I told you to leave me alone I’m
not interested in your book--
Someone POUNDS on the door hard
SARA
Go away you crazy bitch or I’1l
call the cops
The banging stops

Sara holds her breath listens

Nothing but silence Sara inches up to the door corkscrew in
hand Until she finally locks the deadbolt

Sara leans back against the door She closes her eyes sighs
in relief and takes a few cleansing breaths until

RICK (0S)
Back door was open

Sara opens her eyes covers her mouth

A rain-soaked Rick flashes a Cheshire Cat grin His soaked T-
shirt clings to his heaving chest Rick’s drunk

SARA
What’re you doing here

RICK
Are you ready for me

SARA
Ready for what

Sara holds the corkscrew in front of her like a weapon She
backs away from an advancing Rick

Right up against the glass that Goldie referred to in the
text Rick chuckles He likes this game

RICK
I like to play games too

SARA
Stay away from me Or I’11l--

RICK
Corkscrew me to death

Rick yanks the corkscrew out of Sara’s grip throws it across
the room He runs his fingers through her hair

SARA
Go home Rick You’re drunk

RICK
And youre getting fucked against
that glass until you beg for mercy

Rick kisses Sara’s unresponsive lips She resists

SARA
Don’t touch me I love my husband

RICK
I don’t care

He kisses Sara again pins her against the glass Sara cries
out Rick hand-gags her muffles the scream

Rick’s pants drop to his ankles

Sara squirms against the glass Rick pushes hard against her
slender frame grunting as he forces himself ins--

A hard KNOCK at the door upstages Rick

He stops thrusting One hand covers Sara’s mouth His other
index finger pressed tightly to his lips

Rick and Sara stand in silence Another knock-knock

GOLDIE (0OS)
(outside)
Sara Are you still up Please
answer the door

Relief washes over Sara She pulls free of Rick

Sure it’s that crazy bitch But she’s the lesser evil here
or so it seems to Sara

RICK
Get rid of her

SARA
(yells)
Go away or I’1l1 call the police

GOLDIE (0S)
Sara that’s the only copy I have
of my idea I need it please

SARA
Come back tomorrow

GOLDIE
It’ll just take a second Come on
Sara Please

Rick nods yes releases Sara She retrieves the envelope from
the trash then unlocks the front door

Goldie stands in the doorway She looks over Sara’s shoulder
into the house No sign of Rick

SARA
Take it I don’t ever want to see
you again or Ill prosecute

Sara forces the envelope into Goldie’s hand then mouths the
words HELP ME She slams the door shut on Goldie

Rick steps out of the shadows

From behind Rick’s hands clamp down on Sara’s shoulders
retract her into an unwanted embrace

RICK
Good girl

Rick pushes her against the glass she resists He pulls down
Sara’s pants grinds his torso against hers until

GOLDIE (0OS)
Back door was open

The voice spooks Rick He pulls up his pants Sara distances
herself from him grabs the IRON POKER by the fireplace

RICK
She told you to come back tomorrow

GOLDIE
But I’m lonely

A soaked Goldie plays with her long blonde hair Rick likes
what he sees Sara watches Goldie toy with Rick

RICK
Are you lost angel

GOLDIE
No Are you Rick

RICK
How do you know my name

GOLDIE
Sara told me all about you

RICK
She did How nice of her

GOLDIE
Yeah We had a good laugh about you
over some wine Didn’t we Sara

SARA
We did

Rick notices the two wine glasses on the coffee table He
sizes up Goldie fast like good cops tend to do

RICK
What happened to your foot

GOLDIE
Some jerk-offs were harassing Sara

RICK
Really And what did you do

GOLDIE
I made them leave her alone

Goldie glares at Rick Neither one blinks Until Rick looks
over at Sara

RICK
That’s not true You made that up

SARA
She’s telling the truth

RICK
Sara’s very lucky to have a friend
like you looking out for her

GOLDIE
Yeah I keep telling her that but
she never listens to me Maybe you
can talk some sense into her

Rick chuckles

RICK
So are you here in town for
business or pleasure

GOLDIE
A little of both

RICK
Then quit the role playing and join
the party

GOLDIE
I don’t think I’m up for your
needle dick fumbling around inside
me tonight Best be on your way

Rick advances on Goldie gets in her face

RICK
This little game of Let’s Pretend
isn’t over until I say it’s over

GOLDIE
I’m not afraid of you I’ve known
men like you my whole life

RICK
You don’t know me that well

Rick glares at Goldie Until the GROWL of a DOG freezes Rick
in fear He turns around

Grimm eyeballs Rick The hulking white shepherd bares his
massive incisors growls louder

GOLDIE
Oh I know your type all too well
Rick Grimm gib laut

Grimm barks at Rick then charges him The vicious white dog
snaps his jaw inches from Rick’s crotch Again and again

RICK
Call off your dog

SARA
Get the fuck out Rick Now

Rick puts up his hands backs away Every time he retreats a
step back Grimm advances on him Rick opens the front door
glares at Sara for a while
This isn’t over Rick leaves
Sara locks the door then relaxes
SARA
What a fucking day I didn’t know
you had a dog

GOLDIE
Grimm pass auf

Grimm stops growling lays in front of the entrance He rests
his head on his front paws guards the door

SARA
Thank you Again

GOLDIE
Thanks for giving me my pitch back
You want to call the cops

SARA
No Rick’s a deputy sheriff

That fact catches Goldie off guard

GOLDIE
Are you going to be alright alone

SARA
Yeah I’1l be fine I think

Sara puts on a smile Goldie hobbles towards the front door

GOLDIE
Grimm fuss

Grimm rises up next to his mistress Goldie opens the front
door then looks back at Sara

GOLDIE (VO)
Come on Sara Be open to new
opportunities

GOLDIE
Goodbye Sara

Beauty and her beast step outside Goldie shuts the d--

SARA

Goldie grins She turns around envelope in hand Sara takes
the crinkled document

The two women share a smile

NEXT DAY

TODD (VO)
OK but that pin’s been in our
marriage for six months Is it ever

Todd ends the Skype chat Sara silently ponders the question

STUDY - LATER
The pitch envelope sits unopened on Sara’s desk

Much to Goldie’s dismay Her face inches away from the
envelope she scrutinizes every crinkle

GOLDIE (V0)

Well this partnership’s off to a
shitty start

DEN

Goldie opens the GRANDFATHER CLOCK moves the small hand
three minutes ahead

Her frustrated face reflects in the circular glass
GOLDIE (VO)

The clock is slow Sara is slow
Everything is fucking slow

EXT HILLTOP - GOLDIE’S TENT - NIGHT
It’s a starry night crickets chirp

White paws and bare feet stick out of a camouflaged TENT

A bright SHOOTING STAR streaks across the sky its blazing
golden tail lights up the night

Inside the tent A CELL PHONE chimes An unseen Goldie stirs
fumbles about in the dark Grimm barks Goldie hushes him

A lantern glows inside the tent Goldie’s silhouette whips to
and fro looking for the ringing phone

GOLDIE (0S)
Grimm get off the phone

Grimm groans then exits the tent The dog lifts his leg
against a tree trunk urinates

Goldie pops out of the tent a big grin on her face She’s
bathed in starlight as if blessed by the heavens

GOLDIE (VO)
Only one person in the whole wide
world’s got this number I’m so
excited Fuck What do I say

She looks at the ringing phone then answers

SARA (VO)
Hello Shit Did I wake you Shit
I should’ve waited but I can’t
stop thinking about your--

INT LAKE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Grimm lays on the floor Sara stares at the big white dog
then regards Goldie sitting at the dining table

SARA
Does he like cats

GOLDIE
He loves cats Don’t you Grimm

Grimm pants wags his long ivory tail

GOLDIE
But he’s not too fond of guys

SARA
I know how he feels

The two women share a laugh

EXT LAKE HOUSE - DAY

Goldie’s walking normal all healed up now She looks right
at home in Sara’s spandex shorts

GOLDIE (VO)
For the next week We’d work in the
morning then go for a bike ride
After a quick shower that I no
longer have to conceal I head home
to my Grimm It’s a perfect ritual

Sara exits the house safety helmet in hand She’s clad in
similar gear Goldie watches Sara do warm-up stretches

GOLDIE (VO)
I wish I could shower with her

GOLDIE
You sure Todd won’t mind

SARA
Take it He never uses the bike

GOLDIE
Why not

SARA
He says he’s afraid he’ll get lost
in the woods Even though I had a
GPS installed

GOLDIE
So where’s the helmet

Sara regards the WORK SITE for the unfinished COTTAGE

INT COTTAGE - DAY

The framework of the COTTAGE sits on an unfinished concrete
slab It’s all shrouded under thick translucent plastic

A blurry Goldie approaches She lifts the plastic notices
Todd’s bike and helmet

On a nearby makeshift shelf A big cordless NAIL GUN loaded
with long thick roofing nails

Next to that power tool an AXE and HATCHETS hang between
nails on the wall

Goldie mentally catalogs the inventory of weapons

In a corner There’s a new BOBCAT mini-dozer with big knobby
tires Goldie looks in the cockpit a key’s in the ignition

Goldie’s eyes are drawn to a hand-held industrial STREET SAW

GOLDIE (VO)
Hello gorgeous

It’s the heavy duty model the one construction crews use to
carve up city streets like a cake

Goldie grips the industrial saw by both handles wields it
like a chainsaw

GOLDIE (VO)
Someone’s gonna get their skull
split wide open this with beast

SARA (0S)
(yells)
Did you find it

Goldie sighs puts down the shiny street saw

She grabs the helmet notices a ROPE COIL nearby Goldie gets
an idea She grins then grabs the thick rope

GOLDIE (VO)
Think I’1l use this to yank Sara
out of her comfort zone She really
needs to loosen the fuck up if
she’s ever gonna write our story

SARA (0S)
Come on let’s go

Goldie runs her finger over the STREET SAW blade’s jagged
teeth fourteen inches of flesh-ripping steel She sighs

GOLDIE

(yells)
Coming

EXT BIKE TRAIL - DAY
Sara and Goldie stop their mountain bikes take a break
SARA
What about your family Aren’t they
going to be worried about you
GOLDIE
No one’s worried about me Except

for Grimm

SARA
How did you and Grimm meet

GOLDIE
Through his previous owner

SARA
What happened to the owner

GOLDIE
He died

Sara eyes the ROPE COIL around Goldie’s shoulder

SARA
So what’s the rope for

GOLDIE
Follow me and you’1ll find out

Goldie mounts the bike stares at Sara She pedals down the
trail fast

Sara scoffs then stares at the bike getting smaller and
smaller Goldie never looks back Not even once

EXT WADING POOL - DAY
A hidden idyllic tributary of the river ends here

Sara and Goldie lay on their stomachs The women sunbathe on
the rocks surrounding the water

Goldie lounges in a wet tank top Sara wears a revealing
bathing suit The ROPE COIL sits between them

High above the secluded spot A craggy ROCK FACE overlooks
the idyllic swirling pool

ROCK FACE

Someone crouches in the shadows near the edge They leer down
at Goldie and Sara

It’s Peter He fixates on Goldie watches her sprawl out and
stretch in the midday sun

Peter sighs runs his hand through his matted beard then
down his dirty hunting pants

WADING POOL

Goldie bolts upright looks up at the Rock Face She squints
into the shining sun shields her eyes

Peter’s gone

SARA
So how did you come up with the
idea for the main character

GOLDIE
I wanted to tell a story about a
sad little girl who never got what
she wanted until she took it from
the world with her bare hands

SARA
Why do you think she kills all
those innocent families

GOLDIE
Because they’re not just right

SARA
For her

GOLDIE
For anyone
SARA
Walk me through your characters

process How she feels

GOLDIE
This is how she feels

Goldie pulls off her wet tank top revealing many SCARS on
her torso from her victims Sara stares at the old wounds and
hard scar tissue

SARA
Who did this to you

GOLDIE
People that were supposed to take
care of me People like Rick

SARA
I’m done with him I swear

GOLDIE
I know you are Ever since that
night you’ve been different
The two women share a smile
SARA
So I’m dying to know Why did you
bring that rope
Goldie smirks tosses the rope coil to Sara
GOLDIE
Trust exercise

ROCK FACE

Goldie and Sara TANDEM-CLIMB the cliff The rope’s knotted
around their waists tethering them together

Sara tries to keep up with Goldie

SARA
I’m having second thoughts

GOLDIE
Hurry up

They’re half way to the top Fifty feet to go forty

Sara pauses looks down at the tiny bikes below

SARA
We should turn back

GOLDIE
Sara don’t be such a pussy

SARA
I’m not a pussy

GOLDIE
Yes you are A fucking dried up
pussy that couldn’t write for shit
until I showed up

SARA
Ha-ha Very funny I see what you
did there

Goldie reaches the top She looks down sticks her tongue out
at Sara and tugs on the rope

GOLDIE
Come on Get up here pussy

Sara chuckles then speeds her ascent
Goldie reaches out their fingers almost touch
Sara loses her grip on the cliff

Goldie watches her plummet A screaming Sara falls towards
certain death

Until the taut rope snaps her back

The thick cord pulls Goldie towards the cliff She grunts
tries to undo the nylon knot around her waist

The knot won’t come undone

Goldie plants her boot against a rock She skids to a stop
just inches from the edge

GOLDIE
Sara

Sara tries to pull herself up fails She hangs limp and
twirling Sara looks down at the spinning water

SARA
I can’t reach the rope

GOLDIE
Try again You can do this

Sara psyches herself up She reaches up for the rope She’s
so close almost there

Her muscles give out Sara hangs limp grunts

SARA
I can’t do it

GOLDIE
Try harder Or I’1ll cut you loose

SARA
What did you say

GOLDIE
Your family needs you Sara
What’re you going to do

SARA
Shut up Just shut your mouth

Goldie pulls out her HUNTING KNIFE presses the jagged edge
against the nylon rope

GOLDIE
I promise I’ll take care of Brooke
as if she were my very own

SARA
Fuck you I will fucking end you

GOLDIE
Come on up here and try bitch

Sara growls pulls herself up One hand over the other

GOLDIE
That’s it Keep going Almost

Goldie reaches out pulls Sara to safety Both women lay side
by side on the ground gasping for air

GOLDIE
I knew you had it in you

Sara rolls over on top She CHOKES Goldie with both hands
stares into her bulging bloodshot eyes

SARA
If you ever lay a hand on my
daughter I’11 fucking kill you
44

Goldie turns blue She can’t breathe Her eyes flutter
Until Sara finally lets go

Goldie rolls over She coughs hard rubs her red neck Goldie
smells Sara’s musk on her hand

GOLDIE (VO)
I didn’t know she had it in her I
think I just came

GOLDIE
I’m sorry Sara I was just trying
to motivate you

Sara stands near the rocky edge tries to untie the knotted
rope fails again and again

GOLDIE
Here let me get that

SARA
Stay the fuck away from me

Sara slips falls backwards off the cliff

Goldie lunges reaches out for Sara Their fingertips graze
as their eyes go wide Too late

Sara plummets The rope yanks Goldie over the edge

The two women free-fall The nylon umbilical cord flutters
between their bodies

Goldie and Sara scream

They descend a hundred feet end over end Until the pair
splashdown into the wading pool

WADING POOL

Goldie coughs swims for the stony shore She pulls herself
to safety yanks on the rope

It’s dead weight

GOLDIE
Sara Sara Sa--

GOLDIE (VO)
I could let her die here No one
would ever be the wiser Sara’s
death would be our little secret

She pulls out her Hunting Knife presses the blade against
the rope Goldie contemplates cutting the nylon cord

GOLDIE (VO)
No She’s the only one that can
tell our story to the world She’s
the only one that can help us

GOLDIE
Sara

Goldie tugs on the rope with all her might She dives under
the water The rippling surface settles

She’s been down there too long

Goldie surfaces with Sara in hand She lays Sara flat on the
shore Goldie performs CPR

GOLDIE (VO)
Breathe for me Sara

No signs of life from Sara

GOLDIE
Come on Don’t quit on me

Goldie breathes into Sara’s mouth

GOLDIE (VO)
I need you

GOLDIE
Sara wake up

She pumps Sara’s chest again and again Until Sara coughs up
water gasps for air

Goldie smiles She cradles Sara’s head helps her sit up
GOLDIE
Welcome back Mama Bear
EXT LAKE HOUSE - DAY

Goldie and Sara walk their mountain bikes the last few
hundred yards down the trail They both look exhausted

SARA
Why did you call me Mama Bear

GOLDIE
It’s something my stepfather used
to say My mother was Mama Bear He
was Papa Bear And I was--

Something rustles in the treeline
The women freeze A twig snaps then another

SARA
What is it

GOLDIE
I think we have a visitor

Sara tenses Could it be Rick again Or Peter

Goldie stands between Sara and whatever’s out there The
women scan the thick tree line

No signs of life Until another branch snaps Something
charges through the underbrush towards the women

Grimm bounds out of the woods He jumps up on his big hind
legs solicits Goldie for affection Sara relaxes

SARA
That’s amazing he followed you all
the way here from your hotel

GOLDIE
Grimm schlechte hund Platz

Grimm drops to his belly looks away from his mistress

SARA
He’s very well-trained

GOLDIE
Not well enough to stay home when
he’s told to

SARA
He’s probably as tired as we are
Why don’t you both stay for dinner
Would you like that Grimm

The big white dog licks his chops barks approval

INT LAKE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Grimm sleeps on the floor a gnawed STEAK BONE wedged between
his big white front paws

Sara and Goldie finish their breakfast for dinner

GOLDIE
Best French Toast ever

SARA
My grandmother was a wizard with a
cast iron skillet

Sara clears the table rinses plates in the sink She sighs
puts down a dirty glass Sara faces Goldie

SARA
I’m sorry that I choked you I
don’t know what came over me

GOLDIE
I said those things to piss you
off boost your adrenaline

SARA
You really did push my buttons

Goldie nods yes joins Sara at the sink They wash dishes

SARA
But you were right about me Rick
The book idea Everything so far

GOLDIE
I feel the same way about you and
the book Everything’s just right

SARA
Hey we should have Lily sign you
as a client I’1l call her--

GOLDIE
That’s OK We can deal with her
after the book’s done I trust you

Goldie smells something rank Sara too They wince

SARA
Did that come out of your dog

GOLDIE
I’m afraid it’s only the beginning

SARA
How about some wine by the fire

GOLDIE
Sounds perfect

Sara darts into the pantry Goldie smiles to herself She
scrapes maple syrup off a dish

GOLDIE (VO)
This is where we truly belong I
know I’ve said that to you before
But I really mean it this t--
Goldie sees Peter standing outside

He stares at her loaded CROSSBOW in hand Goldie drops a
dish in the sink

The crash rouses Grimm He sniffs the air growls

GOLDIE
Grimm ruhig

Grimm stops growling His black nose twitches he grumbles

Outside Peter takes off his hunting cap His hair’s matted
and greasy He smiles at Goldie waves to her

Sara exits the pantry

Goldie turns away from Peter blocking Sara’s ability to see
through the window

SARA
You like red right

Sara shows Goldie a bottle of Merlot

SARA
The darker the better

GOLDIE
You remembered

SARA
Ill start the fire Come join me
when you’re done

Goldie nods yes washes more dishes Sara leaves

EXT LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

Peter watches Goldie sneak out of the back door He puts down
the crossbow runs his dirty hand through his hair

GOLDIE
What’re you doing here Peter

PETER
I thought I’d surprise you

GOLDIE
This is a surprise

PETER
Aren’t you going to invite me in

GOLDIE
No You can’t be here

PETER
Why She’s not mad is she It was
just a joke We weren’t gonna hurt
her none You’d told her right
The boys are back at campsite--

GOLDIE
I’m sorry Peter But my friend
doesn’t want to meet you Or your
hunting buddies

PETER
I see you with her Every day

Peter tries to kiss Goldie She rejects him

PETER
Come on I could build you a better
castle than this dump

GOLDIE
Only in your dreams

PETER
I want my golden princess at my
side We can rule our log castle
together in the forest

GOLDIE
Everyone wants a happy ending but
that don’t mean they get it

PETER
But I love you Goldie

GOLDIE
Youre trespassing Get out of
here Peter Now

PETER
Come by the camp tonight we--

GOLDIE
Leave me alone you fucking psycho

Goldie turns her back on Peter walks away He picks up his
loaded crossbow aims at Goldie

She’s almost made it to the door Just a few more steps
Peter’s dirty fingernail hovers over the trigger
Goldie enters the Lake House The screen door slams

Peter lowers the weapon retreats into the shadows He
watches Goldie and Sara in the kitchen

The two women laugh about something

Peter drops the loaded crossbow He closes his eyes punches
himself in the back of the head Again and again

Until Peter can’t feel the pain anymore He stops pounding
his skull opens his eyes -- no emotion

Peter picks up the loaded crossbow looks up at the nearby
hillside Where Goldie keeps her tent

INT LAKE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Sara looks at Goldie washing dishes

SARA
Youre flush Are you alright

GOLDIE
I was--

Grimm growls paws at the back door

GOLDIE
Grimm nein aus

SARA
You wanna go out big guy I’11 let
him out

GOLDIE
No Thanks I’11l walk him later

SARA
OK Join me when you’re done

GOLDIE
Grimm pass auf Sara

Grimm looks away from Goldie ignores the command

GOLDIE
Grimm Pass auf Sara

SARA
What’re you telling him

GOLDIE
To guard you while I finish up
It’s not safe around here lately

SARA
Don’t we know it Come on Grimm

Grimm whines Sara claps her hands at the dog

Goldie glares at Grimm then points towards the DEN Sara
starts to leave then Grimm follows her out of the room

SARA (0S)
You can be my guard dog any night
Grimm just don’t eat my cat OK

Goldie unlocks and opens the back door She looks out into
the darkness Her eyes narrow She scans the woods

No Peter in sight Goldie sighs in relief

EXT GOLDIE’S TENT - NIGHT

A cloudy night not many stars Crickets stop chirping
An unseen twig SNAPS then another

It’s dark in the tent Someone stirs within

Grimm trots into view He sniffs the air then utters a low
growl Grimm eyeballs something in the shadows

It’s Peter He aims his loaded CROSSBOW at Grimm

LATER
Goldie steps out of the tent She looks around

GOLDIE
Grimm Gib laut

No sign of Grimm

GOLDIE
Grimm komm

An unseen Grimm WHINES Goldie charges through the forest
blasting past branches

The whines get louder and louder

Goldie stops in her tracks She looks down at something
tears well up in her eyes

A bloody Grimm lays on his side The shaft of a CROSSBOW BOLT
sticks out of his chest

Grimm’s breaths are shallow The dog whines tries to crawl
closer to his mistress

Goldie drops to her knees comforts her killer pooch
GOLDIE (VO)

When I first met Grimm I thought
he was dead

EXT DOG KENNEL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

In the back yard of a rundown house A tiny fenced-in
enclosure that hasn’t been cleaned in weeks

A bloody and beaten Grimm lays on the ground There’s fresh
wounds all over his torso His breaths are shallow

Shredded strips of duct tape cling to his swollen muzzle His
neck’s caked with blood The thick collar’s way too tight

A blood-splattered Goldie steps out of the darkness She
holds an AXE the blade’s slick with fresh gore

GOLDIE (VO)
Once upon a time a Neo-Nazi made
the fatal mistake of inviting me
over for dinner

Goldie notices the big white dog She makes kissy noises with
her lips pokes the chain-link with the butt of the axe

No response Goldie kneels at the foot of the fence She
stares at the motionless dog until

Grimm jumps to life lunges at Goldie

The crazy dog rips into the chain-link fence with what’s left
of its mangled jaw

Blood drops splatter Goldie’s face but she doesn’t flinch

Goldie smiles watches the dog use its last bits of life to
try to rip her to shreds

GOLDIE (VO)
He was a four-legged motherfucking
time bomb exploding in my face His
amber eyes screaming Doesn’t your
world make you want to vomit too

Grimm collapses starts to death rattle

Goldie stares at the downed beast She reaches through the
fence strokes his crimson-stained ivory fur

INT EXAM ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Goldie kicks open the double doors She carries Grimm in her
arms The bloody dog isn’t moving

An old silver-bearded VETERINARIAN regards Goldie He wears a
lab coat over his pajamas a stethoscope around his neck

VETERINARIAN
Put him down on the table

Goldie gently lays Grimm onto the shiny metal slab

LATER
The Veterinarian stitches up an unconscious Grimm

Shaved patches and closed wounds cover the dog His inflamed
muzzle’s now free of duct tape

GOLDIE
Will he live

VETERINARIAN
Hell live What’s his name

GOLDIE
I don’t know He’s not my dog I
was driving through the hills And
I hit him it was really dark

VETERINARIAN
You brought him in So you’ll have
to pay the bill

GOLDIE
I said it was my fault I’1l pay

VETERINARIAN
Then you can take him home now

GOLDIE
What about a shelter His owner’s
probably looking for him

VETERINARIAN
If the owner doesn’t show up in ten
days they’1l put him to sleep
GOLDIE
Why He’s beautiful and strong
Wouldn’t they try to adopt him out
to a family

VETERINARIAN
Not this dog

Goldie looks down at Grimm on the table He whines in his
sleep twitches in pain
EXT VET’S OFFICE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Goldie cradles Grimm in her arms She walks towards a pick-up
truck that’s decorated with SWASTIKAS

The groggy dog stirs licks her hand Goldie smiles whispers
into Grimm’s big floppy ear

GOLDIE
What am I gonna call you Hmmm

Grimm yawns He nestles into Goldie’s embrace then falls
into a deep sleep in her arms

As if he’s under a spell Goldie pets his head
GOLDIE (VO)
If YOU ever tell anyone this story
I swear Ill jump off this fucking
page and slit your throat

END FLASHBACK

INT LAKE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

The room’s dark

Goldie kicks open the door She steps through the threshold
balances Grimm in her arms He’s lost a lot of blood

The crossbow bolt’s still lodged in Grimm’s chest There’s a
wad of bloody gauze around the wound

GOLDIE
Sara Help me SARA

Goldie lays Grimm on the kitchen table

She lifts the dog’s jowl presses her fingertip against the
pink flesh about his incisor Goldie releases observes the
refill rate of the pale gum tissue It’s very slow

Sara arrives She sees a dying Grimm gasps in shock

SARA
Oh my god I’1l1 drive The vet--

GOLDIE
No His blood pressure’s too low
He won’t make it that far I think
I can take it out but I need your
help Or Grimm will die
Goldie weeps

GOLDIE
Please Sara I need you

Sara ponders the dilemma then nods yes She holds Goldie’s
hand in hers

The two women are face to face just inches apart
SARA
OK We can do this
LATER

An empty blood-stained kitchen table There’s a dozen wads of
used gauze in the sink basin

Bloody hand prints stain the wooden KNIFE BLOCK On the
counter top Goldie’s SUTURE KIT it’s used up

Nearby there’s a used syringe with a bent needle A half-
empty vial labeled KETAMINE sits on the floor

DEN

Grimm sleeps on a blanket in front of the warm stone hearth
of the FIREPLACE Burning logs steam and crackle

The big dog’s chest has been cleaned and bandaged His
breathing’s almost back to normal

A bloody Goldie sits on the couch She stares at her faithful
companion sleeping peacefully by the fire

Sara walks downstairs her hair’s wet

SARA
Shower’s all yours How’s he doing

GOLDIE
He’1l live Thank you

SARA
Rick’s an asshole but I never
thought he’d hurt an innocent--

GOLDIE
Rick didn’t do this

Goldie stands up She heads towards the front door

SARA
Where are you going

GOLDIE
Never mind You stay with Grimm

SARA
We should call the police

GOLDIE
No I need to borrow your bike

EXT HUNTER’S CAMP - NIGHT

There’s a DEAD DOE hanging upside down from a DEER STAND The
device is secured to the tree trunk with a metal harness

The doe’s neck hangs awkward Reflected in the poor beast’s
big round black eyes Peter and the three bearded Hunters
warm themselves by a crackling campfire

Smoke rises into the moonlit sky Everyone’s head-to-toe in
camo gear They pass around a bottle of bourbon

The Hunters laugh at dirty pics on their cell phones Peter
watches the woods his loaded CROSSBOW nearby
Something rustles in the underbrush

The men stop laughing listen close The crackling fire’s the
only sound to be heard until

A twig BREAKS behind them

Fire-lit eyes narrow scan the dark treeline Until something
moves in the woods

Peter sees a human-shaped shadow dart between tree trunks
then disappear into the darkness He grins

PETER

She’s here Teach her a lesson
INT LAKE HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT
Sara sits on the couch watches over a peacefully sleeping
Grimm Logs glow orange in the fireplace She ponders
something then picks up her cell phone
On screen A GPS TRACKER app loads A dialog box opens It’s
a push notification Do you wish to notify the police that
your GR200x mountain bike has been stolen Yes or No
Sara presses “No” She watches a map load A blinking red dot
appears on the grid Sara looks at Grimm then the map

EXT THE WOODS - NIGHT

One of the overweight Hunters crouches under a tree sets his
rifle against the trunk

He adjusts the strap on his NIGHT VISION GOGGLES then
surveils the dark forest

NIGHT VISION POV
The forest looks grainy and green

We scan in all directions no movement Just the wind and the
crickets until

Something moves behind us We spin around in time to see

A pair of green eyes low to the ground They stare at us
glowing bright emerald as they reflect moonlight

We aim the rifle muzzle at the eyes hold our breath

The cute bunny hops away We sigh lower the rifle and slowly
turn around in time to see

A wild-eyed Goldie charges at us AXE held high

She swings hard and fast The axe blade lodges right between
our eyes Blood gushes

We hear the sickening CRUNCH of our own skull SPLIT open

Our body falls backwards onto the ground We see our spasming
hands grip the handle try to pull the axe out

Goldie wipes blood from her face plants her booted foot on
our chest We choke on our own blood

She grips the axe handle with both hands then yanks the
blade out of our brain and skull

We gurgle then die Our head lolls to one side
Goldie looks into the lens then head-tilts

The night vision stutters and flickers Static disrupts the
image then stabilizes long enough to see

Goldie spits on our dead face

CUT TO BLACK

THE WOODS

The two remaining Hunters aim their rifles into the darkness
skulk through the dense forest

Behind the sweaty men a SHADOW runs past them The Hunters
spin around fire into the darkness

They hit nothing The Hunters slowly back away then turn
around and face

A big tree trunk They almost walk into it Both Hunters jump-
scare themselves catch their breath

One of them steps into a SNARE TRAP

The tubby hillbilly’s hoisted off the ground foot first He
drops his rifle wriggles like a worm on a hook

The fatter Hunter laughs at his upside down pal

FAT HUNTER
You stepped in your own trap

HUNTER
I didn’t set up snares asshole

FAT HUNTER
Well then who the fuck did

From behind Goldie pummels the Fat Hunter in the back of the
head with something big and blunt

His obese body falls to the ground stunned Goldie stands
over him She holds Sara’s BICYCLE SEAT by the steel shaft
like it’s a baseball bat

Goldie wails on his cracked skull again and again while his
snared buddy twirls high above

The Fat Hunter shrieks in pain

Goldie drives the pipe end into his screaming maw right
through the back of his skull

The bloody pipe lodges into the fresh earth Bits of brain
tissue slough out of the pipe onto the ground

Fat Hunter’s boot death-twitches

Goldie searches his body finds a pack of smokes and a
lighter She smiles

The snared Hunter whimpers and struggles in vain He’s too
fat to reach his trapped foot no matter how hard he tries

Goldie sits on the bloody bicycle seat relaxes Fat Hunter’s
wide dead eyes stare up at her ass frozen in fear

She lights the cigarette inhales deep Goldie savors her
gruesome smoke break She looks down at dead hunter between
her legs

GOLDIE
Hey What’re you looking at

Goldie laughs at her own joke She takes a long drag then
stubs out the cigarette on the dead hunter’s cheek His flesh
sizzles his wide dead eyes unblinking

The snared Hunter above weeps and blubbers His upside down
hands clasped in prayer He whimpers for mercy

HUNTER
Please don’t kill me I’11 be good
Ill find Jesus I swear
The Hunter opens his eyes Goldie’s gone

He tries to swing around and around like a pinata Still no
sign of her The helpless Hunter breathes a sigh of relief

HUNTER
Thank you Jesus

Goldie grabs the Hunter from behind exposing his neck She
slits his throat wide open with her Hunting Knife
HUNTER’S CAMP

Peter surveys the darkness He smells something turns
around Peter sees his tent on FIRE

PETER
What the fuck

The nylon burns fast

Peter tries to salvage his gear He steps on the flames in
vain scans the debris for something

PETER
Where is it

Goldie rises from the shadows brandishing his CROSSBOW A
long STEEL BOLT poised to fire She whistles

GOLDIE
Hey faggot You looking for this

Peter pivots sees Goldie pull the trigger

The bolt flies fast SKEWERS Peter’s KNEECAP His leg twists
folds sideways Cartilage snaps Peter screams falls

PETER
My leg My fucking leg

GOLDIE
Quit your whining You wanted
quality time with me Well now
you’re gonna get it Peter

Goldie grabs the impaled bolt drags Peter towards the DEER
STAND He wails in pain every step of the way

GOLDIE
I told you what would happen if you
wanted to know her name

PETER
Stop Please

GOLDIE
But no you had to be so fucking
charming and helpful

PETER
Put me down

Peter sees the DEAD DOE hung upside down in the tree

Goldie drops Peter He writhes on the ground She circles him
like a predator

GOLDIE
But you forgot one thing Peter
This is my fairy tale Not yours

Peter tries to crawl away from Goldie She grabs him by the
hair pulls his head back She looks him in the eye

GOLDIE
Good night sweet prince

Goldie jams a syringe into his exposed neck injects Peter
with a clear liquid He passes out

DEER STAND - LATER

Peter awakens His bound wrists pulled tight over his bloody
head Peter’s muddy booted feet dangle off the ground

He looks up Peter’s tied tight to a steel DEER HOIST that’s
mounted to a tree trunk

Next to him The freshly GUTTED DOE hangs from a steel hook

The deer’s soft white underbelly sliced wide open from neck
to udder Slimy viscera hangs out of her abdomen

Goldie grabs Peter by the jaw forces him to look at the
gutted doe hanging next to him

GOLDIE
Peter that’s a terrible incision
You’ve ruined the meat

PETER
What’re you waiting for Do it
Goldie leans close whispers in Peter’s ear
GOLDIE
Not yet We’re waiting for the
guest of honor to arrive
THE WOODS
Someone crouches in the shadows

It’s Sara She keeps her distance spies on Goldie Sara
holds her cell phone but doesn’t dial

PETER (0S)
Ill buy you another dog I don’t
want to die like a fucking animal
GOLDIE (0S)
But that’s what you are an animal
that needs to be put down
DEER STAND

Goldie rips open Peter’s camo shirt She presses the blade of
her HUNTING KNIFE against his stomach Peter quivers

GOLDIE
Didn’t anyone teach you how to gut
your prey
She gropes his crotch hard then laughs
GOLDIE
Oh Peter what a big erection you

have You like being tied up boy

Peter laughs Goldie grabs the shaft of the bolt skewering
his bloody knee yanks hard He wails in sheer agony

Goldie releases the bolt Cartilage oozes out of the wound
Peter groans and whimpers Goldie kisses him hard muffles
his cries
THE WOODS

Sara crouches down in the darkness She watches Goldie
dominate her male victim

Sara can’t look away from the visceral seduction She sneaks
a little closer peers between two branches

Goldie mounts Peter thrusts against his bound body

Sara watches Goldie do things to men that she can only dream
of She puts away her cell phone

GOLDIE (0OS)
Do you know what happens when you
cut too deep into the abdomen You
puncture the bladder and then ruin
the meat Peter

PETER (0S)
Goldie I love you Ill do
anything you say Let me go

Sara gasps aloud in shock -- Goldie knows him

She covers her mouth regrets ever opening it Sara holds her
breath listens

The camp’s gone quiet

Sara lays on her belly looks between tree trunks She can
barely make out the Deer Stand but no Goldie

Behind Sara an unseen twig SNAPS

She pivots fast looks up No one’s there just a bird ina
tree making a nest Sara exhales in relief

GOLDIE (0S)
You can come out now Sara You
don’t have to hide from me anymore

Sara freezes like a deer in you know what She slowly turns
back around looks up at a bloody grinning Goldie

GOLDIE
Hey there Mama Bear
DEER STAND
Branches rustle

Someone shoves Sara out of the woods Goldie’s not too far
behind She strokes Peter’s matted beard

PETER
I’m sorry we scared you Sara It
was her idea--

Goldie takes Peter’s hunting cap off his head shoves it deep
into his mouth He protests into the smelly gag

GOLDIE
Here take it

She offers the bloody HUNTING KNIFE to Sara

SARA
Please don’t kill me

GOLDIE
Kill you I don’t want to kill you
Sara I want to save you Take it

SARA

GOLDIE
OK but if I offer it to him he’s
sure as hell gonna take it Aren’t

Goldie regards the bound and gagged Peter He moans MmmHmm

GOLDIE
See He knows how this game works

SARA
Are you two acting out another one
of your fantasies

GOLDIE

You mean like you and Rick
SARA

He’s not for you to keep He’s for
you to kill silly It’s time to
step up your research Our story

kill someone Don’t you Mama Bear

Sara comes to a horrifying realization

SARA
You knew about the GPS You wanted
me to follow you here

GOLDIE
I really hoped you would You
helped me save Grimm so I wanted
to do something special to thank
you in return Mama Bear

SARA
Stop calling me that

GOLDIE
Our book won’t work unless we’re
fully committed to the concept

SARA
It’s a work of fiction Goldie

GOLDIE
No It’s not

Goldie drives the blade deep into Peter’s guts twists it
round and round His organs churn gush blood

Peter wails into the tight gag his body convulses
Sara recoils screams in horror

Goldie pulls out the blade Peter sees his lower intestines
coiled around the bloody hilt

GOLDIE
So what do you think of my
incision technique Peter

Peter screams into the gag Goldie saws up his chest with the
knife He spits blood convulses until he’s dead

Sara looks away in disgust She pulls her out her cell phone
starts to dials 9--

GOLDIE (0S)
Put away the phone This is a
private party Invitation only

Goldie pulls the knife out of Peter glares at Sara

The two women stare at each other They’re bathed in
moonlight Sara slowly pockets the smartphone

Goldie holds the bloody blade extends the hilt towards Sara

GOLDIE
Go on Give him a poke Who knows
you might be a natural

Sara looks at the knife She reaches out her fingers tremble
inches from the hilt Goldie smiles

GOLDIE
That’s it Good girl Closer

Like a wild animal being tamed Sara inches closer and closer
to Goldie and the knife She touches the hilt

GOLDIE

Sara grabs the hilt Goldie lets go of the blade

SARA

Goldie dodges the attack She disarms Sara puts her ina
head lock Sara squirms in Goldie’s tight grip

GOLDIE

Sara grunts and struggles until Goldie releases her The two
women face off

GOLDIE

Goldie offers the knife to Brooke The child’s reflection
looks contorted on the jagged blade

GOLDIE
Take it Go ahead

Rick shakes his head no His bloodshot eyes pleading He
starts to free his wrist Grimm growls silences him

Brooke stares at the knife She grabs the hilt

GOLDIE
That’s a good girl

Goldie wraps her fingers over Brooke’s digits guides the tip
of the blade towards Rick’s face

Rick thrashes in the chair His eyes wide with fear The tip
now inches from his gagged mouth

GOLDIE
(baby talk)
Now open up for the aeroplane

Goldie makes whooshing noises as if the knife were a jet on
final approach The steel tip pushes through the sticky gag

Just as Rick pulls his wrist free from the bloody tape

Brooke screams Rick chokes a surprised Goldie She grabs his
arm squeezes a fresh wound Rick grunts in pain holds on

Grimm lunges at Rick bites into his throat Huge incisors

shards scatter across the hardwood floor

Goldie pulls the levers The Bobcat skids to a stop The
bloody contents of the front scoop spill out in the room

Grimm sits on the bed licks his chops and growls louder The
ROAR of the unseen saw’s engine gets closer and closer

Grimm bares his teeth lunges at Sara The dog slams into her
chest mauls Sara She falls back against the wall

The spinning SAW BLADE slices through the door

Sara screams holds Grimm by the neck his massive jaw snaps
inches from her face She backs him into the spinning blade

The saw slices through the dog’s unseen spine splatters the
door with fresh blood Grimm whines and convulses

Sara drops the dying dog runs in the WALK-IN CLOSET She
shuts the DOUBLE MIRROR doors behind her

loyal beast dead on the floor Goldie puts down the saw She
hugs Grimm wails like a grieving mother

Goldie kisses his limp muzzle whispers into Grimm’s ear

GOLDIE
Mommy’s sorry She didn’t mean it

RAGE grows within Goldie She looks under the bed No Sara
Goldie’s savage reflection moves across the mirrored double
doors leading to the CLOSET

GOLDIE
We both have lost loved ones today

sacrifices for our art But it
doesn’t have to end like this

Sara jumps right through the mirror Reflective shards shower
the bloody women Sara body-slams Goldie to the ground

SARA
Yes it does

Sara strangles the life out of Goldie Goldie reaches for the
street saw with the other

Too far away Goldie gut-punches Sara chokes her Neither
one can breathe each one hellbent on strangling the other

They’re both about to pass out Their bodies convulse their
bloodshot eyes bulge Goldie injects Sara with a SYRINGE
INT GRAVE - UNDERGROUND

Almost total darkness Someone’s breathing hard Short rapid
breaths gasping for oxygen

The sounds of crinkling heavy plastic punctuate the labored
breathing Until whoever it is wakes up

SARA
Fuck Someone help me Help

Sara’s voice sounds amplified as if she were in some kind of
confined space

SARA
Can anyone hear me

Sara wiggles her fingers against the plastic reaches for
something in her pants back pocket It’s a PEN LIGHT

GOLDIE (VO)

Killing Sara was for the best She
was coming between us In the end
you’re the one that’s going to
spread our tale to all the good
little girls and boys And then
maybe one day you’1ll tell our
little tale to your kids

She turns on the tiny LED revealing her fate
Saras wrapped in thick plastic It’s the same stuff Todd
used to cover the unfinished cottage On the other side of

that flimsy opaque barrier

Nothing but DIRT The dark earth surrounds Sara Waiting to
smother her if she punctures the plastic

SARA
GOLDIE I’11 fucking kill you

The screams give way to tears Sara wriggles one shoulder
then the other She moves her hand holding the light a
little then a little more

The beam illuminates her crying face The plastic barrier
hovers just millimeters above her blinking eyelashes

Sara drives the other end of the pen light against the thick
plastic She blindly digs at the barrier with the steel CLIP

The clip scrapes back and forth against the plastic Sara
arcs her wrist again and again

It’s no use Her breaths fast and shallow
Sara pulls at the tiny hole it widens

Her fingernail splits down the middle Sara grits her teeth
claws at the hole The bloody nail’s stuck to the plastic

Sara coughs and chokes She’s almost out of air Then she
hears a CAR HORN Sara screams for all she’s worth
