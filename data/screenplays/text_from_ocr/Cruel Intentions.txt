reputation

SEBASTIAN
Let me tell you something doctor
Chicks love a guy with a bad rap
They say they dont but they dont
mean it They all think that theyre
the ones that are going to Save me

true

for it

SEBASTIAN

Most people are morons I mean who are
you to knock what youve never experienced

belief that people shouldnt actually
experience the act of love until they are
in love and that people our age are too
immature to be in touch with those
emotions

SEBASTIAN
Oh really

ANNETTE
Take yourself Youve slept with several
women Are you happier because of it

SEBASTIAN
How do you know Ive been with several
women

person before you judge them instead of
listening to some bullshit gossip

but you still didnt answer the question

An uncomfortable silence falls between them
SEBASTIAN
Who the hell is taking the time to write
letters spreading this shit about me
