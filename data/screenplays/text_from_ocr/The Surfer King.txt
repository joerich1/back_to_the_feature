Drag me kicking and screaming from my
happy home in California to some weird
place in Colorado and say hey thisll

CONNIE

have some kind of mid-life crisis and
disappear with his secretary to Mexico
with our life savings

ROBBIE
Administrative Assistant Theres no
such thing as a secretary anymore

CONNIE
Fine Administrative Assistant We
couldnt afford to sit around waiting any
longer to see if he was coming back I
was able to land a good job here And

job at the Water Park

ROBBIE
(shaking his head)
Grounds crew What kind of job is that
It sound like the guy who cleans out the
coffee pots

CONNIE
Bernie says you help keep the park clean
sweep up that sort of thing
Im sure it wont be so bad Besides a
lot of the kids who work at this park go
to the same high school youll be going
to You can start the school year with
some ready-made friends

ROBBIE
I had friends in Oceanside I had
something to do for the summer

banner that says Opening Tomorrow

CONNIE
Hanging out at the beach surfing with
your friends is not my idea of something

8 EXT MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - OUTSIDE UNIFORM BUILDING

ROBBIE and ALEX walk up to yet another line of about 4
or 5

teens At the front a teenage girl and a teenage guy
are

behind a counter and handing out uniforms based on a

clipboard list

As ROBBIE and ALEX reach the back of the line TIFFANY
a

blond beauty and two other girls brush past them to the
front

through his nose)

ALEX takes off and AOKEE runs again

EXT MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - SURFS UP WAVE POOL

WE SEE several rolling trash cans lined up in a row
with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning
and supplies

THE COLONEL is standing dressed in army fatigue pants
Water World golf shirt with a green Water World

cap He is wearing black horn-rim glasses thick
carrying a clipboard

Lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids
ROBBIE who is sixth furthest from THE COLONEL They
younger than ROBBIE except one EDDIE whom we met at
beginning of the film

EDDIE is standing tall and straight proud to be there

is nearest THE COLONEL

Page 11 of 81
THE COLONEL

(looking up from clipboard)
Well it looks like we have a good staff
here Yesyes a good staff It will be
an excellent summer Remember as we go
through training today our park is
judged by the work WE do If we do it
well the people come back

(walking up and down the line)
We have a little tradition here on the
grounds crew Rather than having to
learn a lot of names many of which I can
never hope to pronounce properly each
grounds crew member gets a grounds crew
nickname You will be known by that
nickname in every way except of course
your paycheck and employee records

THE COLONEL looks over his paperwork

THE COLONEL (CONTD)
Lets see what do we have Hmmyes
OK first up is Eddie Cochran Your
grounds crew nickname will be Eddie

EDDIE smiles knowingly This has been his grounds crew
nickname for the last 8 years mostly because he would
never
answer to anything else and THE COLONEL gave up
trying

THE COLONEL (CONTD)
Now crewmembers listen up Eddie here
has eight years experience on the grounds
crew Why Id like to think there isnt
anything any situation that Eddie hasnt
faced Listen to him Learn from him
Watch what he does This man is the
finest most conscientious grounds
crewman weve ever had

EDDIE is beaming with pride now THE COLONEL pulls a
brand

new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to

EDDIE EDDIE shoulders it as if it were a rifle

THE COLONEL walks down the line
THE COLONEL (CONTD)

Lets seeClark Hmmm Your grounds
crew nickname will beSparky
It is all ROBBIE can do not to laugh THE COLONEL goes

on to

the next kid SKEETER who is tall skinny and goofy-
looking

SKEETERS eyes are faced forward but something catches
them

His eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a
small

mosquito Finally his eyes follow it until he looks
cross

eyed at his own nose

THE COLONEL has taken note of this and is following it
too

SKEETER can take no more and brushes it off his nose
as he

makes a face

Page 12 of 81
SKEETER
Sorry sir Mosquito

THE COLONEL

THE COLONEL steps over the cart and gets another new

plunger

and hands it to SKEETER who follows EDDIEs lead

Next in line is a short chubby lad SNITCH As THE
COLONEL

approaches him a quick sound of passing gas is heard

THE COLONEL is startled and SNITCH makes a quick
finger

motion indicating the culprit is SKEETER next to him

THE COLONEL (CONTD)
(looking at the clipboard)
Bradley is it OK Mr Bradley your
grounds crew nickname will be Snitch

SNITCH shows his dismay with a frown THE COLONEL has
run
out of new plungers already and is forced to move to

one of
last years leftovers which look somewhat depressing
He gets one and give it to SNITCH who looks at it
makes a
face and decides not to shoulder it ROBBIE is so
depressed
he looks like hes about to pass out
His worst fears have been realized His summer is
passing
before his eyes
Theres only one more person a young 14 year-old girl
to go
before ROBBIE THE COLONEL addresses her
THE COLONEL (CONTD)
Melinda Tally Hmmm your grounds crew
nickname will be
(thinking)
Suddenly ALEX bursts onto the scene and even he at
this

point is somewhat out of breath

ALEX
Hello Colonel

THE COLONEL
(thinking staring)
Alex isnt it

ALEX
Yes sir Colonel And what a fine staff
youve assembled this year Have you
told them yet about your army background

THE COLONEL
Well no I didnt think it was

ALEX

Page 13 of 81

(interrupting to the grounds
kids)
The Colonel here is very modest Did you
know that he reorganized the entire
process of cleaning and sanitizing an
army barracks and its latrines

THE COLONEL
Well it really wasnt much of a

ALEX

(interrupting again)
Wasnt much

(again to grounds kids)
Can you just imagine for a moment the
germs and bacteria our American soldiers
could pick up in an unsanitised army
latrine Its impossible to determine
just how many lives have been saved
thanks to the efforts of this one humble
Army Colonel

THE COLONEL
Well I suppose when you put it that
way

ALEX
(to the grounds kids)
I too came up through the ranks when at
age 14 I began my service here at Water
World learning from this great man

THE COLONEL

YesI remember now what was your
grounds nickname
ALEX

Not even sure I remember it myself sir
But I remember much more Did you tell
them about the film

THE COLONEL

AOKEE gestures he is fine and does a combination of
and Hawaiian pantomime before he finally speaks

he ended up here

THE COLONEL
(looking at clipboard)

AOKEE
(reassuring)
I promise we go straight to personnel

THE COLONEL
Very well Well just have to make-do

THE COLONEL goes back to the girl MELINDA he was about

Page 16 of 81

AOKEE THE COLONEL and other management types are

ALEX and ROBBIE are sitting together towards the back
and

ROBBIEs grounds t-shirt is no longer in his hand but

been replaced by a folded AOKEES blue Hawaiian shirt
There is a lot of noise from everyone talking

BIG MIKE

(motioning to get everyone to

settle down)
Okay everybody lets quiet down for a
minute

his clipboard)

A chant starts up with affection

EVERYONE TOGETHER
Big Mike Big Mike Big Mike

BIG MIKE smiles this has happened before probably a
tradition

BIG MIKE

(again motioning to settle

down)
Okay yeah thanks Now I want go over a
few basic things First of all make
sure youve all filled out your paperwork
with personnel cause nobody gets paid
unless they do Come to think of it I
suppose its better for me that you dont
fill out your paperwork then I dont
have to pay you Ill make it optional
If you want to get paid fill out your
paperwork

(looking at clipboard)
Lets remember the people who come here
are our guests and your job is to see

they have a safe and fun experience here

clean and safe and well have a great
summer together Now with a few words is
our head lifeguard Richard Thompson

Another cheer starts up smaller this time which ALEX
starts

SMALLER GROUP
Big Dick Big Dick Big Dick

RICHARD
(wincing some but not

Page 17 of 81

surprised motioning to settle
down)
Yeah yeah very funny were all very
amused Okay many of you have been in
training for some time and some of you
still have a ways to go

WE SEE a quick shot of some geeky younger guards
wearing

water wings sharky goggles and noseplugs and looking
less

than confident

RICHARD (CONTD)
(glancing at the water wing
group wistfully almost to
himself)
a long ways to go

He looks down at his clipboard

RICHARD (CONTD)
-but Id like to take a moment to
speak mostly to the guards but
certainly everyone has a role in this
We can take everything weve learned and
distill it down to two simple rules
Rule number one

He pauses thoughtful for a moment but building into a
near
rage for effect to impress on everyone

RICHARD (CONTD)
(loudly emphatically angry at
the thought that anybody
might)
Dont drown

He stops composing himself

RICHARD (CONTD)
(almost quietly)
Rule number two

Again thoughtful but building to a rage at the thought
that
this could happen

RICHARD (CONTD)
(loudly emphatically)
Dont let anyone else drown

He stops again and regains his composure

RICHARD (CONTD)
(almost quietly to the stunned
crowd)
Thank you Have a great summer

There is stunned silence for a moment Theyre not
sure how
to react

ALEX

Page 18 of 81

(breaking the silence)
Alright Whoo whoo

ALEX then everyone begins applauding ROBBIE looks at
ALEX
quizzically ALEX just shrugs The meeting breaks up

13 INT - MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - AOKEES SURF and SNACK
SHACK 13
Everyone is hurrying around getting ready for opening
day

ROBBIE wearing his new blue Hawaiian shirt is cutting

pineapple AOKEE is busy hovering over everyone and
cooking

chicken on the grill ALEX walks in

ALEX
(to ROBBIE)
Hey hey lookin good Blue is your

AOKEE
(unhappy stressed)
Alex You are late Come on is opening
day

ROBBIE finishes the pineapple and hands the tray to
AOKEE
almost spilling it

AOKEE (CONTD)
(to ROBBIE and ALEX)
You two start setting tables

ALEX takes a pile of silverware wrapped in napkins and

points to ROBBIE to grab a box of sugar packets to
refill the

dispensers ROBBIE grabs it quickly enthusiastically
but

loses his grip and spills the packets on the floor

At that moment AUDREY a girl in her teens who works at
AOKEES and is stacking plastic cups on the counter
accidentally knocks a stack of cups to the ground

RAMON a teenage boy who works there is behind the
counter

He bends over disappearing and we hear a crash of
pots and

pans His head peers up from below the counter
sheepishly

AOKEE turns from the grill looking at all this and has
worried look but smiles and shrugs weakly
AOKEE (CONTD)

(to ALEX gesturing)
Alex Come here a minute
ALEX comes up close next to him at the grill so they
can

talk

AOKEE (CONTD)
(with intensity)
Alex look We falling apart I made

ALEX

Page 19 of 81

(agreeing)
No problem

ALEX pops a CD out of the rack above the sound system

and
puts it in the CD player stopping the standard
pastoral
Hawaiian music that has been playing
He turns up the volume some on the amp and goes over
to
SARAH a teenage girl working there and grabs her
grass
skirt by the Velcro removing it with a Velcro rip
ALEX (CONTD)
Sorry Sarah but I need to borrow this
SARAH
(surprised)
Hey How did you know I wear shorts
under that
ALEX
(mock surprise rolling his
eyes)
Oh Puh-leeaase
ALEX walks back out to the dining area everyone is
still

working

ALEX (CONTD)
(to all)
Ladies and Gentlemen may I have your
attention please

Everyone stops and looks at ALEX

ALEX (CONTD)
In exactly 30 minutes hundreds of
dripping wet customers with fistfuls of
money smelling of chlorine and suntan
lotion will be walking in here
And what will they be looking for
(as if directing a choir)

EVERYONE TOGETHER
(except ROBBIE who doesnt
know any better)
The best teriyaki east of the pacific

ALEX
Annnnnnd

EVERYONE TOGETHER
(Again except ROBBIE who
doesnt know any better)

proper frame of mind and relax we need

Page 20 of 81

the right soundtrack
(to AOKEE)
Maestro

AOKEE hits the play button on the CD player

ALEX (CONTD)
This is little tune I like to call the
Paradise Slide
(mouthing with the song as it
starts)
One two a one two three
The music starts and ALEX now wearing SARAHs grass

skirt

launches into his version of the electric slide
Hawaiian

style

EVERYONE ELSE gets the beat and begins working to the
music

AOKEE is using his spatulas as drum sticks on the
overhanging

kitchen tools
RAMON has inverted an empty pot and is beating it
conga-drum

style

ROBBIE has picked up the sugar packets and ALEX is

dancing

and quickly (almost casually) tossing silverwarenapkin
rolls

to ROBBIE as ROBBIE catches them (at first with some

difficulty) and puts them on the tables

SARAH has re-stacked the cups and is juggling salt and
pepper

shakers placing them on the tables AUDREY chops
onions to
the beat

EVERYONE TOGETHER
(on the chorus)
Don Ho Don Ho Don Ho Don Ho Don Ho
Don Ho

AOKEE has now taken all the chicken off the grill and

comes
out from behind the counter dancing The others form a
CONGA LINE behind him

Oh daddy You know how jealous people

BIG MIKE
Id almost believe that But I was behind
the First Aid station when you said the

see you are just another lifeguard

TIFFANY
(protesting)
But Im not just another lifeguard

BIG MIKE
(mad again)
You wont even be that if this continues
If you want to keep coming here every day

Many

OMai or You Are Mine
AOKEE begins singing the Hawaiian love song E OMai
couples are dancing it is a slow song
ALEX of course is a goof He dances slow but every

in a while executes a deep dip much to AMYs terror

EDDIE is off to the edge of the dance floor watching
of

nothing in

and

quite

was

they

longingly and kind of swaying to the music A couple
girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them

He holds both hands up palms open to show he has

his hands He also gestures that he has no sleeves (he
wearing a tuxedo t-shirt) He reaches behind his back
pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers but they dont
open right and are still unfolding as he holds them
EDDIE smiles weakly he knows that isnt quite how it
supposed to go The girls appear encouraging but as
leave look at each other and giggle

We pick up ROBBIE and KATIE dancing

KATIE
So How are things working out at
Aokees

ROBBIE

Oh hes great Alex too I thought
this summer was going to be a train
wreck but its not turning out too bad

KATIE
Well of course this isnt California

ROBBIE
No but it looks like I will get a chance
to do some surfing anyway

KATIE
Really

ROBBIE
Apparently theres some kind of surfing
contest and Aokee is all over me to
enter

KATIE
You mean the Surfer King

ROBBIE

KATIE

about This is my first year but

apparently its a pretty big deal Being
from Oceanside you should have a good
chance
ROBBIE
Well see It seems kind of stupid to
me A surfing contest in Colorado
(laughing)
My friends back home would never believe
it
They continue to dance WE SEE BIG MIKE talking to
and gesturing broadly TIFFANY is clearly not agreeing
what he is saying COWBOY is nowhere to be seen

throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor

EDDIE is standing alone swaying a bit to the music

She whispers something in his ear and EDDIES eyes get
big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the
floor She wraps her arms around EDDIE and they dance
the while glaring at her father

EDDIE knows a good thing when he sees it and quickly
in Big Man on Campus TIFFANY is taller than he is so
happily puts his head on HER shoulder

BIG MIKE looks back at them not happy with the way it
happened but satisfied

DOUG FITZGERALD (twenty bucks DOUG) is dancing with a
when ALEX doing some kind of fancy spin to AMY bumps

into
him
DOUG
(to ALEX)
Alex Got my twenty bucks
ALEX
Oh Dougie You know I left my wallet
over in my locker Ill see you before
we leave and get it to you then
DOUG
Yeah sure
ALEX
You know you could always come by
Aokees and I could give it to you in
trade
DOUG
Cash money Alex Cash money
ALEX
No problem
ALEX grabs AMY and swings her into another fancy move
that

leads them away from DOUG

Page 45 of 81
The song ends and everybody claps AOKEE bows

ROBBIE
(to KATIE)
Hey listen Alex told me about this
great spot on the other side of Thunder
Bay that looks down on the party but
its a little more quiet Want to go for
a walk

KATIE
Sure
They pick up their smoothies and walk off into the

night
37 EXT MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - NORTH EDGE OF THUNDER BAY

ROBBIE is walking on the seawall that separates the bay
from
the sunning area tightrope style KATIE walks next to
him

KATIE
Sowhat made your folks pick up from
beautiful southern California and move to

Colorado
ROBBIE

Not both my folks Just my Mom
KATIE

Ahatrouble in paradise

ROBBIE
Lets just say my father had an eye for
his administrative assistant and now
theyre both somewhere in Mexico Mom
got a job here some of her familys
here so they said Colorady is the place
you outta be

KATIE
It could be worse

ROBBIE

Well I must admit Ive met some very
nice people

(looking down and smiling)
In California the attitudes a little
different Here not everyone is out to
prove something Seems like everyone
just wants to have fun

KATIE
I have a theory Sometimes it snows here
so hard that its a challenge just to
get to work or to school Everything
shuts down for a day or so If your car
gets stuck people appear from nowhere to
help pull you out and get you back on the
road Most people here dont just look
out for themselves A lot of times

EXT MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK

ALEX and AMY are inside the KIOSK ALEX is showing
everything works
ALEX
All these switches feed sound throughout
the park Which reminds me
He pulls out a CD and pops it into the CD Player and
PLAY He sees a flyswatter and begins waving it around
a sword
ALEX (CONTD)
And this is for bad little girls who
dont know how to have fun

He begins swishing it around AMY is giggling

ALEX (CONTD)
Oops Therealmost got you

AMY is dodging and laughing ALEX closes in and seems
he will kiss her but just starts gumming her neck
her AMY leans back laughing and WE SEE her back hits
volume knob on the amplifier

EXT NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER GRAND PAVILION

They have reached the area to the west of Thunder
simply a concrete pad that overlooks the party below
hear Paradise is in Your Eyes by Michael Peace

begins with a lot of jungle sound effects
KATIE
(looking down at the party)
You were right This is nice
(reacting to the jungle noises)
But not necessarily quieter

ROBBIE
Just a sec

He walks away slightly and gets on the radio
ROBBIE (CONTD)

Hey Alex Give us break down here
Turn down the sound effects

40 EXT NIGHT - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK

ALEX and AMY are kissing she is up on the counter of
the

KIOSK

ALEX
(interrupting but to AMY)
Uh oh Sorry Hold that thought
Page 47 of 81
He grabs the radio
ALEX (CONTD)
(into the radio)
Im on it

He turns down the volume back to normal He also flips
a

switch They hear the tune now and AMY jumps off the

counter stands there and smiles ALEX does an over-
the-top

mambo moving to her and they start to slow dance

41 EXT NIGHT - GRAND PAVILION

ROBBIE has set down the radio and is walking back to
KATIE
now who is swaying to the music He doesnt get too

close

to her and actually stands off to her left

Since she has the room and is momentarily inspired she

begins a few dance moves ballet and then ballroom
style

ROBBIE has seen this sort of thing before and
instinctively

almost without thinking steps in and becomes her dance

partner They proceed in a beautiful dance that almost
seems

rehearsed Finally it occurs to them both

ROBBIE
(quizzically)
So where did you learn to dance like
this

KATIE
(smiling)
Eight years at Miss Vickies Studio of
Dance What surprises me is you

ROBBIE
(somewhat embarrassed keeps
dancing)
Can you keep my deepest darkest secret

KATIE
Of course

ROBBIE

(hesitantly)
When you grow up within spitting distance
of Hollywood every mother seems to think
her child is the next Harrison Ford So
when I was about 12 my Mom started
taking me to all these auditions for
things

KATIE
So are you the next Harrison Ford

ROBBIE
Some days Im not even the next Robbie

Zirpollo

They continue to dance After a few moments
Page 48 of 81

KATIE
-and

They stop and walk over to the railing overlooking the
party

ROBBIE
Turns out I get this part Theyre
selling some dish soap or something and
they think it will be magical to have
two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom
on this fantasy set with clouds and
everything They lock this girl and I
into a dance studio with a choreographer
for two weeks and then they shoot the
commercial

KATIE
Doesnt sound so terrible You certainly
learned how to dance

ROBBIE
Yeah but when it came out everyone in
school saw it I couldnt go anywhere
for six months without everyone in the
room laughing their heads off

KATIE
(touched drawing closer)
Im not laughing

They kiss then return to dancing

a

conch shell and blows it like a horn He is dressed
like a

Hawaiian prince

dressed in Hawaiian native garb ROBBIE And ALEX are
among

several drummers with bamboos sticks in their hands
that

provide percussion for the Hawaiian war dance

AOKEE
Aie noka moka kei kai ke alo

The drums begin and the male dancers carrying spears
begin

the Hawaiian war dance The drummers sing the Hawaiian
folk

tune No ka moku Kiakahi Ke Aloha

There are about 100 concessions kids in regular uniform

sitting cross-legged behind them clapping the beat in

unison

The MALE DANCERS circle each other in time to the beat

gesturing a story the seems to involve some invading
army

The war dance progresses until the invading warriors
are

defeated and the folk song ends At the end the kids
sitting behind raise their hand and shout

lifeguards sitting Everyone is looking around
Suddenly two lifeguards dressed as Roman Soldiers
horns They bellow a Roman Call to Action and two

drummers lead a column of other lifeguards

of 81
First we see female guards dressed in togas filing in

them are six gladiators with swords and shields

They are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket
rose petals She is throwing them into the path of the
group to enter

Next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying
COWBOY who is sitting up on a First Aid backboard HE

wearing laurel leaves and a toga he is obviously

The guards holding COWBOY set him down in front of an
elevated platform that has a microphone

COWBOY picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the

COWBOY moves to the microphone and raises his arm ina

We see that the lounge chairs have been removed and the

paper lying about

We look to the south and see that there are three

teams with one of their legs tied together like a
legged race

The rub here is one team member has the dustpan and the
team member has the broom A JUDGE triggers a starter
and they are off

The lifeguard team falls almost immediately and the
team takes a early lead over the concessions team who
trying to figure the dustpanbroom operation out The

grounds people work tightly together and quickly

The lifeguards have gotten back up and are hobbling up
their first piece of trash Concessions has figured out
dustpan but are still well behind the grounds kids

horn to start the race They all rush into the bay and
swimming furiously

The guard takes the lead quickly followed not far

the grounds kid The concessions kid is working hard
splashing a lot but not getting very far

As the guard reaches the back wall he does an

racing turn and swims back toward the point where they
started Right behind him the smaller grounds kid does

same thing

As they are returning they pass the concessions kid
still is splashing a lot but not going fast After they
him he stops as he is tired out

Momentarily he cant even tread water any more anda

area and begin CPR

The guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets
blow air into the mouth of their victim and they roll
quickly on his side to clear water and back to begin
They are fast and efficient and clearly expertly

We move left to see the grounds kids knowledgeable but
inexperienced One girl is using her hands to provide a
seals over the mouth of her victim and another is
pumping his chest while the others try to keep a count
reading some kind of instruction card

We move again to see the concessions kids who are in
trouble ALEX is lying there dying and they are

about who has to breathe into his mouth They forma
over him pointing and arguing

Finally they all just walk off and ALEX is still lying
ground eyes rolled back and twitching convulsively in
hilarious death scene

The JUDGES take their notes

EXT LATER THAT DAY - IN FRONT OF THE CANNING COMPANY
Once again three teams representing the three competing
factions Large stainless steel pots are bubbling on
propane cooking stands in front of the concession

The teams each have three members in cooking aprons
color coded One from each team is stirring the teams

chili

while the others watch the JUDGES anxiously

Lines are forming in front of each pot with people in
line

each carrying a paper chili bowl but holding back
deferring

to the JUDGES The JUDGES are each carrying three styro
cups

in which to receive the chili

They each get a portion from the guard team and take a
sip

They smile politely to the cooks but turn around and
spit

the chili back into the cup as delicately as possible
almost

as if throwing up A concessions kid is there with a
tray of

waters which they quickly take advantage of

They move on to the grounds team They get their
portions

and taste the chili and nod not bad

They take another sip of water to clear their palate
and move

on to the concessions team The portions are proudly

scooped

They take a taste smile and take some more They
huddle for

EVERYONE is confused there has never been a tie

BIG MIKE

(clearing his throat

flustered)
It looks like we have a tie This has
never happened before but I seem to
remember we provided for this possibility
in the rules Hopefully our judges can
help us figure out what to do

The HEAD JUDGE is reading to the other JUDGES out loud
his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike

HEAD JUDGE

Reading from the rules in the event
of a tie at the end of three heats in the
surf competition the teams who are tied

70 EXT -MOMENTS LATER - AOKEES SURF and SNACK SHACK

Page 75 of 81

ROBBIE ALEX AOKEE and PIPEMAN have gathered in front

AOKEEs to strategize

AOKEE
So what you do Wait for him to go crazy
and fall

ROBBIE

Dont want to win with him falling

PIPEMAN
You could always go out and do your very
best take a lot of chances and maybe win
this thing on merit

ALEX
(dismissive)
Dont be silly That only works in the
movies

ROBBIE

(shakes his head)
Actually thats exactly what Im
thinking Its the reason were ina
tie Ive been too conservative Ive
got to do everything I can or just
forget about it Its all or nothing

(pause)
We gotta pull the fin

AOKEE
Pull da fin
PIPEMAN
You think you can hold it

ROBBIE

(explaining)
One time these tourists from Japan on
the beach at La Jolla offered me a
hundred bucks to do a full spin at the
top of the wave and then slide down and
cut back and do a full back flip I
pulled it off A friend of mine had a
tricks board with just a single fin and
foot pockets

PIPEMAN
We gotta pull the fin What do we do
about the foot pockets

ROBBIE
You got duct tape

PIPEMAN reaches into his tool belt and pulls out a

roll
PIPEMAN
What kind of plumber would I be if I
didnt have duct tape Water World
Page 76 of 81
Platinum Where do you want them
They place the board on a table ROBBIE pulls off two
small
pieces of tape and places them on the board
ROBBIE
Here and here
PIPEMAN gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and
begins
removing the two outer fins of the board He then
begins
looping duct tap around the board to create two foot
pockets

This provides a background to the dialog below
AOKEE
So help me understand What you do now

ROBBIE
Pipeman is taking the extra fins off my
board I only need one to make a deep
cut back He is also putting some
pockets to slip my feet into so when I
flip upside down I dont lose the board

ALEX
Flip upside down

ROBBIE
A back flip You guys see it on
snowboarders here all the time Im sure

ALEX
Oh yeah Im sure I did that last winter
But not on purpose Dude Youre either
gonna win this thing or youre gonna die

AOKEE
(quickly eagerly)
It would be better if you won

ROBBIE
Yeah well a tie is like kissing your
sister

ALEX

(mock anger)
You stay away from my sister

We hear an air horn blast They are ready to
start
PIPEMAN
Ready
ROBBIE

(to PIPEMAN)
Ill need the biggest wave you can give
me

PIPEMAN
(imitating Mr Scott on Star
Page 77 of 81

Trek)

Ill give er all shes got Capn

He hands Robbie the board ALEX heads back to the

bleachers
area PIPEMAN goes to the pumphouse in back of Thunder
Bay
AOKEE hangs back with ROBBIE and speaks to him alone
AOKEE
(dropping his Hawaiian accent)
Robbie When you do this do this mostly
for Robbie Zirpollo But do it just a
little bit for Manny Ramirez eh
AOKEE smiles and pats him on the back Robbie nods
They
head for the bay
71 EXT MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY

COWBOY is in the water paddling out to get his wave It
comes and he has apparently decided to stay with what
has
gotten him this far a conservative style that keeps
him
looking good without falling His ride is similar to
the
last one but even more graceful and lyrical and he
gets a 9
ALEX
(to ROBBIE)
Looks like hes waiting for you to make a
mistake You sure you know what youre
doing
ROBBIE
Im just making this up as I go along

The CONCESSIONS KIDS have started to chant ROBBIE

The guards are anxious but even they cant help moving
