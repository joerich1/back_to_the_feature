FADE IN
INT LIVING ROOM - UPSCALE APARTMENT - NEW YORK CITY
A BORED FILIPINO BABY-SITTER sits on a sofa watching One
Day at a Time

On the floor in front of her KAYLA - an ANXIOUS EIGHT YEAR
OLD GIRL - writes A LETTER

KAYLA (VO)
Dear Mom and Dad - OR Dad and Mom -
I hope it doesnt bother you whose
name I put first because I love you
both equally Im writing to you
about some concerns I have when
youre not here Number one Zach
thinks hes in charge I have many
problems with that

(beat)

Leandra doesnt have a lot of
answers

She turns to look at the baby-sitter

LEANDRA
Why you write letters to your
parents They live here

Kayla shifts positions and SLOWLY GROWS ALARMED

KAYLA
--My foot
(beat)
I cant feel my foot

INT HALLWAY - BACHMAN APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Clutching her letter Kayla LIMPS past THREE YEAR OLD WES
whos UTTERLY FOCUSED on RACING TWO MATCHBOX CARS

INT ZACHS CHILDHOOD BEDROOM -- NIGHT

AN ANGRY TWELVE YEAR OLD strums Billy Joels Big Shot (not
well) on a GUITAR Kayla knocks and enters

KAYLA
(panicked)
Zach help me Theres something
wrong with my foot

ZACH
Get out of my room
KAYLA
Seriously Zach I cant feel
anything I need mom and dad

ZACH
Were not calling mom and dad
because your foots asleep

Zach spots Wes in the hall behind her He SIGHS and RISES

ZACH (CONTD)
Why is he out of bed

Just now Zach SNIFFS THE AIR - suddenly concerned

FILIPINO BABY-SITTER (0S)
Ayyyyyye

INT BATHROOM

Zach runs inside (Kayla and Wes trailing) to find the shower
curtain ON FIRE

KAYLA
Oh my God

SCARLETT a WAIFISH ELEVEN YEAR OLD stares at it PERPLEXED

SCARLETT
I was making a campfire

ZACH
In the bathtub

Thinking fast Zach grabs the HAND SHOWER and - over KAYLA
AND LEANDRAS SCREAMS - SPRAYS THE CURTAIN

SCARLETT
I wanted us to have our own camp -
So we could sit around and tell
stories-

KAYLA
In the bathroom

Finally the flames go out Kayla looks to Scarlett
SCARLETT
I thought Zach could play the

guitar and you could-

Suddenly Kayla SCREAMS - she points to a corner of the
curtain STILL ON FIRE
Zach grabs the sprayer and turns it on the area

SCARLETT (CONT’D)
No My campfire

Scarlett grabs his arm - haphazardly redirecting the spray
At Kayla SOAKING HER

Still holding his TWO CARS Wes GIGGLES and CLAPS Kayla
looks down at herself IN SHOCK

KAYLA
You ruined my letter

Leandra just CROSSES HERSELF picks up Wes and exits Zach
rolls his eyes and walks off

As Scarlett walks off - downcast - Kayla watches her go
Until she feels a drop of water on her foot

She looks at her letter As the BLURRED WORDS drip off the
page

DISSOLVE TO
INT KAYLAS APARTMENT -- PRESENT DAY

We PAN ACROSS rows of important literature War and Peace
Madame Bovary Jane Eyre - fill the bookcases ENDING ON

A FRAMED CHICK-LIT BOOK POSTER with a skinny pastel women
kissing a chiseled pastel guy on the cover

The Perfect Guy (or How Chloe Lost Her ‘Baby Wait) by Kayla
Bachman

33 YEAR OLD KAYLA (still anxious) stares at A COMPUTER
SCREEN where A MERE HALF SENTENCE is written

The CURSOR FLASHES She CHEWS HER LIP

KAYLA (VO)
There was something between them
It was unnameable
(to herself)
Oh thats good Kayla Nice
trick Its only unnameable
because you cant name it
(beat)
Come on Loser get in the game
Dont call yourself a loser - it
just makes things worse
(looking at the poster)
(MORE )
KAYLA (CONTD)
Just- pretend youre human
Pretend you understand human
feelings Pretend you didnt need
a restraining order against your
last boyfriend

(beat hopeful)

I bet lots of people are
pretending Maybe no one really
knows about love Maybe youre
not alone

She looks down and begins PICKING HER CUTICLES

KAYLA (VO) (CONTD)
No youre definitely alone

Just now her PHONE RINGS STARTLING HER

KAYLA (CONT’D)
(answering)
Hello
(curt)
Zach - Listen its not a good
time Im- What about her I cant
today Im- Fine Your office
(suddenly nervous)
Does it have to be your office

CUT TO
A BRIEFCASE MONOGRAMMED with TWO GOLD LETTERS ZB We are -
INT CONFERENCE ROOM —- LAW FIRM - OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

The briefcase sits on a conference table 36 YEAR OLD ZACH
BACHMAN is at the head Zach is clean cut STILL IN CHARGE

ZACH
Did they get us the draft too late
Yes Do we have to make sure the
clients get it on time Yes

One LAWYER leans over to ANOTHER LAWYER -

LAWYER 1
Why does Zach Bachman insist on
asking and answering his own
questions

LAWYER 2
I think hes the only person he
wants to have a conversation with

BACK TO Zach as he CHECKS THE CLOCK and finishes up
ZACH
-And since this is my last day I
just wanted to say thanks Its
been nice working with everyone

SILENCE A few of the lawyers smile politely
CUT TO

THE TWO MATCHBOX CARS from 1982 They sit on the window
ledge of

INT THE WORLDS MESSIEST LIVING ROOM

We PAN ACROSS Piles of mail dirty plates beer cans
change and a SKINNY CAT -

ENDING ON TWO SOCKED FEET (one tapping quickly up and down)

While one sock is grey (used to be white) and hangs four
inches off its toes the other is black With three holes

TILT UP to meet WES BACHMAN in socks and boxers Good
looking - though THE DIET of CIGARETTES and BEER SHOWS

Hes UTTERLY FOCUSED on the BASEBALL GAME on TV

HE GLANCES AT THE CLOCK then pulls a shirt off the couch
next to him smells the armpits and puts it on

He picks up his cat and - still watching the screen - KISSES
HER And then - something on screen disappoints him

WES
(evenly)
Shit

He puts down the cat and rises Passing his bedroom we see
A GIRL PASSED OUT in bed (A BONG on the floor next to her)

He goes to his computer (on a GAMBLING WEBSITE) ORIOLES vs
INDIANS 11-3

As he SCROLLS THROUGH his WAGER HISTORY we see most items
are IN RED LOSSES

Reflexively he opens a PILL BOTTLE searches through SEVERAL
PILLS and POPS ONE IN HIS MOUTH

He glances back at his computer And POPS ANOTHER

CUT TO
INT LOBBY - MIDTOWN OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

At a BANK OF ELEVATORS a CROWD OF PEOPLE (including Kayla -
apprehensive) waits DING

The elevator doors open people get inside Kayla swallows
letting them pass - watching them PACK IN TO THE SMALL SPACE

As the doors close (without her inside) she smiles nervously
at the SECURITY GUARD who stares at her

KAYLA
Ill just take the next one

He couldnt care less She presses the UP BUTTON MORE
PEOPLE trickle into the lobby

By the time the elevator arrives JUST AS BIG A CROWD has
assembled Kayla checks her watch and gets on with them

She presses 21 looks around the packed space THE WALLS
START TO CLOSE IN She quickly pushes her way out -

KAYLA (CONT’D)
Excuse me - excuse me
(scarily intense)
Excuse me
She gets off - just as the doors close behind her
CUT TO
INT LOBBY - MIDTOWN OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY
The ANNOYED SECURITY GUARD unlocks the door to the stairwell
KAYLA
Thanks I really appreciate this
(off his blank stare)
Thanks again Thanks

INT RECEPTION AREA - 21ST FLOOR

THE STAIRWELL DOOR OPENS and Kayla - TRYING TO CONTROL HER
PANTING - enters The RECEPTIONIST raises her eyebrows

LOUIS

LOUIS
(thinking)
I dont know

JOY
(vindicated)
Do you see

KAYLA
So whats the deal with Scarlett
this time She give all her money
to the homeless Start an art
collective for orphans

Joy closes her eyes As though what shes about to say is
the proof shes always needed that everyone is against her

JOY
Scarlett has left the city

KAYLA
What do you mean

LOUIS
(beat)
Shes joined a group of people
Who dont live here

WES
-Like a circus

JOY
A group of troubled people who she
thinks are helping her
KAYLA
(half-joking)
What like a cult

No one says anything

WES
Scarlett joined a cult

JOY
Its not a cult

ZACH
(calmly)
Its a cult

As Kayla absorbs this - stunned Zach hands her a PAMPHLET

KAYLA
How did this happen

LOUIS
Your sisters very sensitive

ZACH
Im sensitive you dont see me
joining a cult

JOY
Boys are different

KAYLA
Im a girl and Im not in a cult

JOY
(impatient)
I dont know Kayla

KAYLA
(re the literature)
The Apostles of Infinite Love
Wisdom and Truth

ZACH
And power Its continued on the
back

KAYLA

Wait - Ive seen this She was
going to these ‘life enhancement
classes She invited me to go
WES
(realizing)
Oh Jesus She invited me too

They both look to Zach ITS CLEAR SHE NEVER INVITED HIM

He looks away

ZACH
She left a note in her apartment

He hands the WRITTEN NOTE to Wes

WES
(reading)
‘Where there is only self-love
there can be no community
Unfortunately I was poisoned by my
parents selfish version of love-

JOY
Poisoned Can you imagine

WES
(reading)
The Apostles have shown me the
virtue of true community - achieved
by separation from the hostile
world and its material perils

ZACH
Which means shes given them money

WES
Why would she give them money

KAYLA
Because ‘separate yourself from
material perils means-

LOUIS
Give all your money to the cult

Zach buzzes his assistant

ZACH (INTO THE INTERCOM)
Would you send in Rick

KAYLA
Whos Rick

ZACH
Ricks the deprogrammer were
hiring

WES
By the way that means its a cult
Mom

JOY

In a minute Im going to joina
cult all right How about that

ZACH
(calmly)
This isnt about you Mom

KAYLA
I dont understand why Zach was the
only one who knew about this

LOUIS
Hes a lawyer

KAYLA
What does that have to do with it

LOUIS
We were trying to do what was best
for Kayla

Kayla looks at her father incredulous

KAYLA
Im Kayla

LOUIS
Of course Sweetheart You know
what I mean

Enter RICK DELACROIX LATE THIRTIES GOOD-LOOKING Hes the
picture of NEW-AGE CALM but BUSINESS-LIKE AND SELF-ASSURED

RICK
Hi folks Rick Delacroix

Louis extends his hand and Rick HANDS HIM A CARD
RICK (CONTD)
I always say Sorry were meeting
under these circumstances but not
sorry were meeting

Louis turns to his wife

LOUIS
My stomach really hurts

JOY
Go home Louis

LOUIS
No Joy I want to be here

RICK
You all might be feeling some anger
right now Wondering - is this a
ploy for attention If so why
Where did Scarlett learn-

Louis gets out of his chair and LIES DOWN ON THE FLOOR

LOUIS
Im sorry but this is the only
thing that makes it feel better

Zach Kayla and Wes look at their father lying on the floor
A beat and they look back at Rick

ZACH
Why doesnt Rick tell us a little
about whats going to happen

Rick tries to act like Louis lying on the floor is normal

RICK
I know a fair amount about The
Apostles Aggressive recruiting
powerful mind altering
Fortunately for you Im just as
aggressive

KAYLA
So what exactly do you do

RICK
Well need to evacuate Scarlett
bring her to a safe place and
begin re-education

ZACH
Whos we

RICK
Id like her siblings to be with
me

KAYLA

Us Kidnap Scarlett
RICK
(quickly)
Its not kidnapping Kidnapping is
a felony This is voluntary

KAYLA
What about my parents

RICK
Unfortunately having your parents
along might be counterproductive as-
Well did you read the note

JOY
We poisoned her

KAYLA
Uh isnt this a little extreme
Maybe shell come back on her own

RICK
Doubtful The note highlights her
growing dependency on the group

WES
So where is she

RICK

As Kayla Zach and Wes exchange looks -

KAYLA

Wes opens his bag and locates a bottle (amid a tangle of
clothes)

Just now Kayla notices a CRYING TODDLER whose MOTHER pulls
her through the terminal

KAYLA (CONT’D)

(beat)
That child is in pain and her
mother just ignores her All that

RICK
I didnt mean to suggest she was
abused Just vulnerable

ZACH

KAYLA
(clutching the seat)
Zach your driving is making me
really nervous

ZACH
We have to get there somehow
Kayla Were not going to be

WES
(reading aloud)
‘We preach the Gospel of equality
We believe in love and freedom for
societys lowest members’

The leader of Scarletts group also
believes in appropriating other
mens wives as part of a spiritual
doctrine

I was what was commonly called a
Moonie Fifteen Looking for

answers Reverend Moon exploited
that See the relationship with
the self-appointed leader is based
solely on power They thrive on
their victims excessive devotion

defense

ON THE PHONE holding an UNLIT CIGARETTE

Zach watches A PRETTY GIRL pass and give Wes a LIGHT

RICK
The most important thing to

adversaries

He says that mostly to Zach prompting him to turn his
attention back inside

RICK (CONTD)
Were there to talk to Scarlett
To educate her about the danger of
being under the influence of a
destructive group

God gave you a body and mind
Honey What you do with them is up
to you If you sneak a sleeve of
Ritz Crackers you just make it
harder for God to love you If you
laugh during Guys and Dolls
practice you make it tough for God
to care

contact

RICK
An exit counselor I know Jack
Bench is working with a family
headed down to find the same group

KAYLA
Another deprogrammer- I mean
intervention specialist

RICK
Exit counseling is somewhat
different from what I do Not as
effective if you ask me
ZACH
Its a little effective since he
knows where the group is and you
dont

Rick forces a non-confrontational smile
RICK

I should have their exact location
by morning

WES
So should we find a hotel for the
night

JERRI

KAYLA

You think

OVERWEIGHT KID 1

On stage Nathan Detroit does an awkward dance move

embarrassing

KAYLA
-Scarlett and I were never really
close I mean we shared a room

over every decision she barely
considers consequences

RICK
Unfortunately in this case the
consequences can be dire See
its a coordinated program of
thought reform-

KAYLA
Do you talk that way about
everything or just cults

RICK
Oh uh- I dont know

KAYLA
Not that its- Sorry - I didnt

to cover the fear Hey - fears a
tough competitor I should know

RICK
Before you idealize me you should

with what I do

KAYLA
Complications

DEPOSITION from his briefcase He hands it to Kayla

RICK
Kidnapping charges A young woman

circumstances Familys suing me
Claiming I was a ‘vigilante’ That

WES
What vessel

Theres a knock on the door Rick sticks his head

RICK
Zach told you whats going on

KAYLA
About the vessel Yes

Zach starts laughing again

KAYLA (CONT’D)
Stop laughing

RICK
I was worried about this They
seemed to be exhibiting the traits
of a doomsday cult

WES
Whats a doomsday cult

RICK
Do you remember Heavens Gate

WES
No

RICK
Their beliefs were based on a
mixture of Christian doctrine and
UFO theories They thought
extraterrestrials sought to bring
humans to a higher level and that
properly timed suicide would-

ZACH
(impatient)
A doomsday cult means they kill
themselves

Silence

inside

KAYLA
Well lets go for Gods sake We
have to get there before the vessel
does

INTEXT RENTAL CAR -- DAY

Theres tension in the car as Zach drives Kayla listens
intently to Rick

RICK
Hal Belkin the Apostles leader
is timing the suicide by an
astrological chart He believes
when the moon is in Mercury the
planets will align to-

KAYLA
Excuse me Rick
(to Zach)
Now you go the speed limit

ZACH
Itll take two days to get to
Alabama The vessel isnt coming
for four

KAYLA
I wish youd stop calling it the
vessel like its a big joke
ZACH
Thats what they call it Kayla -

Kayla looks to Rick Reluctantly he nods
CUT TO
INT ROADSIDE BAR -- NIGHT
A COUNTRY BAND PLAYS for the FEW REGULARS at the bar

CLOSE ON A MAP OF ALABAMA Zach and Rick pore over the map
spread out in front of them Kayla READS SCARLETTS NOTE

RICK
Jack Bench took ninety-three down
hes been taking it back and he
said its smooth sailing

ZACH
Ninety-three is taking us twice as
long as fourteen would

RICK
Twice as long You sure

ZACH
Obviously Im exaggerating to make
a point Rick but-

RICK
I hear you about fourteen but the
challenge with fourteen is-

ZACH
Fourteen cuts two hours off the
trip How is that a ‘challenge

RICK
I have no vested interest in
arguing with you Zach - believe me
- but fourteen has traffic

ZACH
And ninety-three is all back roads-

KAYLA

Excuse me I think I blacked out
about ten minutes ago - are you
still talking about fucking ninety
three and fourteen Because our
sisters going to kill herself in
three days so the nuances of the
route are kind of beside the point

Kayla shakes her head disturbed
KAYLA (CONT’D)
This makes no sense Why would

Scarlett want to die

Before Zach can respond he spots Wes behind the bar - using
THE BARTENDERS computer

He finishes and pounds fists with THE BARTENDER

ZACH
Is he betting

KAYLA
(disbelieving)
I think so
A moment later Wes approaches with FOUR SHOTS

KAYLA (CONT’D)
What are these for

WES
Clevelands in the playoffs

KAYLA
Good Because thats whats
important right now

Rick slides his shot away from himself

RICK
I dont drink

Not missing a beat Wes does Ricks shot
CUT TO

INT ROADSIDE BAR -- LATER

KAYLA
(feeling the alcohol)
Can I tell you guys something
personal

WES
Definitely

Kayla takes a deep breath

KAYLA
Im getting my eggs frozen

WES
What eggs

KAYLA
(sarcastic)
The eggs in my refrigerator

WES
-Why

KAYLA
Oh just for the hell of it

WES
Oh Weird

He goes back to watching the game
KAYLA

(incredulous)
The eggs in my ovaries

WES
Oh Why

KAYLA
So I can have children later in
life

WES

Thats creepy

KAYLA
Maybe for you because you can have
kids until youre seventy-five

ZACH
Hes right Theres something
really depressing about it

KAYLA
(annoyed)
Its not depressing its a
technological advance I want
kids but I dont want to feel
pressured to meet someone so -

WES
I dont want that kid in the
family

ZACH

Me either He depresses me

KAYLA
Thanks Glad I decided to share
with you

Kayla takes a sip of her drink starts listening to THE BAND -
theyre playing Americas Sister Golden Hair

KAYLA (CONT’D)
Hey This was one of Scarletts
dance party songs Do you
remember

Zach listens for a moment MOMENTARILY TRANSPORTED
ZACH
Yeah She loved this song

The three of them listen After a while

KAYLA
Why would Scarlett want to give up
control of everything Her
autonomy Her life

No one has an answer After a beat -

WES
Do you remember the time Scarlett
brought home that dying pigeon from
Central park

KAYLA

(laughing)
Yes It was so sad It had one
foot and one stump for a foot And
a messed up wing remember
Scarlett was amazing - she was like
Jason Bourne - she distracted the
baby-sitter caught the pigeon hid
him in the doll carriage Got him
home and saved his life

WES OPENS HIS MOUTH to say something then DECIDES AGAINST
IT Kayla starts to TEAR UP After a beat

KAYLA (CONT’D)
So why is she doing this

Zach and Wes share a look - mostly uncomfortable with Kaylas
emotional display Zach gestures to Wes to say something

Wes AWKWARDLY PATS KAYLA ON THE BACK

Just now the front door opens and an EXHAUSTED LOOKING MAN
enters with an WEARY MIDWESTERN COUPLE -

The wife is overweight the husband smokes As Rick exits
the bathroom he SPOTS THE MAN WITH THEM

RICK
(surprised)
Jack

Jack eagerly approaches its evident that hes thrilled to
see new people
JACK
(extending his hand)
Rick
(re his couple)

Rick leads Jack and the couple to the Bachman table

RICK
(to the table)
This is Jack Bench - the exit

RICK
Congratulations on completing the
first step of a difficult process

MR MILLER
Congratulations four grand later

JACK
(closing his eyes)
It hasnt been an easy trip

MR MILLER
Thats the understatement of the
damn century

Mrs Miller shifts GASPING DRAMATICALLY clutching her knee -

MR MILLER (CONT’D)
For the love of God take a pill
Sarah

MRS MILLER
They make my throat dry

JACK
(weary )
Sarah Jonathan Please

Kayla and Zach exchange a look but before anything else can
be said - CRASH A bottle is smashed on the bar -

EVERYONE LOOKS UP AT THE BAR - Wes is GRABBED FROM BEHIND

A SKINNY DISORIENTED YOUNG MAN - DRESSED ENTIRELY IN BLACK
(and wearing a WOVEN WRISTBAND) - has him in a head lock

He holds the broken bottle to Wes throat Kayla and Zach
jump to their feet -

KAYLA
Oh my God Wes
MR MILLER

ZACH

JACK
(calmly)

Justins eyes dart around the bar -

JUSTIN
(in a HIGH VOICE)
Nobody move

ZACH
Wes dont panic

MR MILLER
Goddammit Justin-

MRS MILLER
I knew I should have stayed in the
room with him but the doctor said
movements good for my joints so I-

JUSTIN
(in a high voice)

KAYLA
(to Zach)
Whats wrong with his voice

Zach eyes Justins crotch MOTIONS SCISSORS SNIPPING
Kaylas EYES WIDEN as she looks at JUSTINS CROTCH

JACK

Justin waves the gun around the bar PEOPLE SCREAM

KAYLA
Holy shit Were going to die

ZACH

Wes gets to Kaylas side Kayla clings to him

KAYLA

Before he can answer Justin shoots the gun into the ceiling
WES FAINTS

KAYLA (CONT’D)
Oh my God Wes

ZACH
(to Mrs Miller)
Tell him hes going back

MRS MILLER
(hopeful )
Honey youre going to come home

ZACH
(to the Millers)
Will you stop doing that

SUDDENLY Justin is HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A BOTTLE REVEAL
The BARTENDER with a broken bottle in hand

SOUTHERN BARTENDER
I dont care where the son of a
bitch goes - get him outta my bar

CUT TO

EXT BAR -- LATER

In the background Justin is hauled into a POLICE CAR Zach
sits with Wes who holds an ICE PACK against his jaw

ZACH
--Then Justin shot the gun again
Kayla screamed and you fainted

WES
I didnt faint I passed out

ZACH
A really important distinction
considering you just got your ass
kicked by a eunuch

Kayla brings Wes a drink

WES
I need a pain killer

Rick approaches He looks QUITE DISTRESSED

RICK
We need to talk

INT MOTEL LOBBY -- MOMENTS LATER

Kaylas head is in her hands Wes just looks miserable -
holding an ice pack to his cheek

ZACH
(incredulous)
A weapons cache

RICK
Thats where Justin got the gun
ZACH
Youre telling me they have a
stockpile of weapons

Zach starts to pace

RICK
Jack says the FBI knows but
theyre not taking action because
theyre afraid of another Waco

ZACH
So if we try and get Scarlett
were going to get killed

KAYLA

We have to call the police
RICK

Bad idea
ZACH

Really Rick You still feel
qualified to talk about good and
bad ideas Because you didnt know
where the group was you didnt
know they were going to off
themselves and you didnt know
they had weapons

KAYLA
Zach-

RICK
I understand your feelings Zach
but if youll-

ZACH
Oh you understand my feelings
Oh good I was worried you might
not understand my feelings That
was my big concern right now

RICK
(evenly)
What I do isnt an exact science

ZACH
Gee really I hadnt noticed
that

RICK
(under his breath)
More sarcasm

KAYLA
Zach lets calm down and hear Rick
out

RICK
Thank you Kayla
(beat)
Well need to get guns and go in
ourselves

KAYLA
What

WES
Cool

ZACH
Are you serious Thats your
suggestion

RICK
The chance of us needing to
discharge the weapons is minuscule
Remember these people have a major
agenda set Odds are theyll give
Scarlett up rather than chancing a
disturbance

ZACH
Were not getting guns and storming
the Goddamned Apostles of- whatever-

RICK

Infinite Love and Truth and Wisdom
KAYLAWES

And power
ZACH

Whatever Im not going to put
everyone in that kind of jeopardy
Were calling the FBI

RICK
And Then what
(beat)
You think the FBIs gonna show up
in the next two days
(moving closer)
(MORE)

RICK(CONTD)
You think theyre gonna swoop in
and save your sister
(dramatic)
Get real Zach

Zach starts to pace again Kayla ponders the options

KAYLA
Ricks right

ZACH
Oh really So youre going to
use a gun

KAYLA
Yes

ZACH
You break out in a cold sweat going
through the Lincoln Tunnel but
youre going to pack heat

WES
Dont say pack heat

RICK
I can get a layout of the compound
from Jack Thatll eliminate any
element of surprise If I know
these types theyll have escape
routes everywhere

KAYLA
I think we should vote Wes

WES
Ill do whatever

Zach rolls his eyes - exasperated

KAYLA
Zach what choice do we have If
we dont do this shes going to
kill herself in seventy-two hours

RICK
We cant do anything tonight
anyway Lets get some sleep and
well reconvene in the morning

ZACH
We try to talk to her first If we
cant convince her to take a ride-

KAYLA
We just slip her sedatives
separate her from sixty people with
guns and force her into a car
unnoticed

They all look truly fearful at the prospect Zach makes a
turn Ahead of them is A CONVERTED FARM HOUSE

»-This place looks like PARADISE - surrounded by rolling
hills and fields of wild flowers

WES
This is-
KAYLA
(stunned)
Gorgeous

As they drive up the FLOWER LINED DRIVEWAY A GOLDEN
RETRIEVER runs beside the car

WES
This is a lot nicer than where I
live

A BLOND CHILD appears Cherubic Smiling A BEAUTIFUL
BLOND WOMAN approaches and scoops the child up in her arms

Though shes ALL IN BLACK (wearing the wrist band) shes the
very picture of bliss She APPROACHES THE CAR Zach slows

ZACH

CUT TO

EXT CORN FIELD -- DAY

The blond woman escorts Wes Zach and Kayla to the vast
field where around FORTY PEOPLE PICK CORN

sunglasses-wearing cult member from another

As they approach Wes talks to the beautiful blonde (AMELIA)

WES

She smiles

WES (CONTD)

She smiles wider

WES (CONTD)

spots her family For a brief flash she looks frightened

Then she breaks into a HUGE SMILE

AMELIA (CONT’D)

AMELIA

baskets and run toward the see-saw and jungle gym -

AMELIA (CONT’D)

Bodyguard 2 lifts his shirt to REVEAL A GUN tucked into his
pants BACK TO INTIMIDATING

INT RENTAL CAR
Zach Kayla and Wes (all freaked out) confer
ZACH
Jesus shes barely there Shes a
total clone
WES

individuality they conform more
easily to the leaders wishes

What I listened to Rick
KAYLA
(realizing)
I know what we have to do

WES
(nervous )

Before Kayla can respond Zach spots A WRIST BAND on one of
the cult members

ZACH
Shit We dont have the wrist

(beat)
Okay just- dont let anyone look

WES
(anxious )
How do you stop people from looking
at your wrists

ZACH
The same way you pick corn Wes I

EXT CORN FIELD

Kayla looks around Unfortunately the CORN IS HIGH AND she
cant see anyone whos NOT IN HER ROW -

She stands next to two cult members who chat while working -

CULT MEMBER 1
What do you think the vessel will
be like

Kayla discreetly listens in

CULT MEMBER 2
I told you Like ice cream all the
time Ice cream and hugs

CULT MEMBER 1
I love ice cream

CULT MEMBER 2
What about hugs

CULT MEMBER 1
(defensive)
I love hugs too
(beat)
I bet its luxurious - like a limo

CULT MEMBER 2
Were not supposed to want material
things

CULT MEMBER 1
Not in this life Once we get to
the vessel its okay

CULT MEMBER 2
Oh yeah
(beat)
Well three more hours and we find

eMEANWHILE - Zach picks corn looking for Scarlett
FINALLY he spots her

He scans the field for Kayla and Wes but the corn is too
high Afraid to lose the opportunity he approaches

ZACH
Scarlett

She turns around Stunned and then angry

SCARLETT
What are you doing here

ZACH
Im here to take you home Now put
down the corn and lets go

SCARLETT
I am home This is my home

Just now a bell is rung

BODYGUARD 1

As the cult members gather their baskets and start inside -

ZACH

ZACH
Of course New York is impure Its
New York

SCARLETT

She starts off

ZACH

Youre not a follower youre smart
and opinionated-

SCARLETT

sacrifice for my family

That last part stings

ZACH
Theres no vessel

She stops and turns back

SCARLETT
How do you know

ZACH
Because- Im your big brother
Thats how

Scarlett shakes her head ever so slightly Clearly
affected by this Still
SCARLETT
(beat)
Bye Zach
Scarlett joins the others Wes (holding a VERY FULL basket

of corn) and Kayla have been watching

ZACH
Where were you

KAYLA
I couldnt see past my row

WES
(ashamed )
I got really focused on picking

ZACH

You have to talk to her

KAYLA

ZACH
You understand her - you have that
thing about admiring her courage

KAYLA
Uh yeah I also think shes nuts

WES
Youre the only one who can do it

Pause

KAYLA
Great So no pressure

INT DINING ROOM

CULT MEMBERS wait on line to get corn bread corn chowder
corn on the cob Zach - holding a tray - keeps an eye on

Wes Who hovers near Scarlett (carrying a TRAY OF FOOD)
He PALMS THE CRUSHED PILLS in his hand

As he eyes her drink SOMEONE STEPS IN HIS PATH He ducks
away and collides with ANOTHER CULT MEMBER -

As the guy LOOKS AT WES Wes quickly turns away A door
opens and everyone FALLS TO THEIR KNEES

Zach and Wes look at each other and immediately fall to
their knees as well

THEIR LEADER HAS ENTERED Meet HAL A short so-so looking
guy with a commanding presence and A GUINEA PIG

HAL
My children
(stroking the rodent)
Who would like to be Fernandos
guardian for our final meal

HANDS SHOOT UP Hal points to AN EXCITED CULT MEMBER He
approaches and HAL HANDS HIM THE GUINEA PIG

With everyones focus diverted Wes reaches over and DROPS
THE CRUSHED PILLS into Scarletts drink

HAL (CONTD)
My children Rise

HAL (CONTD)
And be seated

Everyone makes their way to their seats Wes and Zach
scramble to find chairs

They all sit - eyes glued to Hal Scarlett is ENRAPTURED
HAL (CONTD)
Tonight is the last night we
languish in this time-space
Rejoice
A CHEER rises from the crowd He looks out into the crowd
HAL (CONTD)

Amelia approaches him - PRACTICALLY GIDDY She stands in

front of him and he proceeds to FONDLE HER BREASTS
WES

ZACH

HAL
Who else would like to receive a
final soul search

DOZENS OF WOMEN jump to their feet - Scarlett among them
Zach turns to Wes NODS He NODS BACK

In the chaos of the forming line Wes approaches Scarlett

SCARLETT
(angry)
What are you doing I told Zach-
WES

Scarlett looks skeptical but concerned
WES (CONTD)

Five minutes then well leave and

Contemplating this Scarlett SUDDENLY YAWNS Wes looks to
her empty glass

INT BATHROOM

Scarlett opens the door to find Kayla - who immediately locks
the door behind her

KAYLA
We need to talk

SCARLETT
I thought you were sick

KAYLA

SCARLETT

KAYLA
(blocking the door)

Hey I came all the way from New
York to see you and I do not leave

Scarlett folds her arms A reluctant agreement

KAYLA (CONT’D)
I dont want you to die

SCARLETT
You dont get it None of you do -
it isnt a bad thing

KAYLA
Okay Lets say there is a vessel
(searching)
And the vessel has everything

eternity with a hundred freaks

Scarlett closes her eyes shakes her head She opens them

SCARLETT

Scarlett tries to leave but Kayla blocks the door

SCARLETT

KAYLA

SCARLETT

Kaylas surprised both of them with this
CUT TO
INT DINING ROOM

As the women wait on line the men eat Zach and Wes slowly
inch toward the door TRYING TO REMAIN UNNOTICED

INT BATHROOM
Scarlett seems AFFECTED but CONFUSED

KAYLA
Youre the bravest person I know
You set fires you save pigeons

Scarlett sits on the edge of the bathtub She looks up A
LONG PAUSE

SCARLETT
I dont want to feel anymore It

Kayla sits next to her sister
KAYLA
Then Ill help you okay Well

Kayla takes her sisters hand
KAYLA (CONT’D)
Theres no vessel that can show up
and make it any easier than that
SCARLETT

A long pause Kayla squeezes Scarletts hand

KAYLA
Tell me about it

And there it is A moment of clarity Scarlett looks her
sister in the eye and NODS

INT DINING ROOM

Zach and Wes are almost at the door when THE GUY WHO BUMPED
INTO WES SEES THEM Suspicious he looks at Wes wrist

CULT MEMBER
Hey - who are those guys

Suddenly ALL EYES ARE ON Wes and Zach
WES
(to Zach)
We need to go

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE DINING ROOM

As Scarlett and Kayla exit the bathroom they see Zach and
Wes fleeing the dining room

HAL (0S)

SCARLETT

As cult members start to give chase the four siblings run

HAL (0S)
(furious )
Our perimeter is being secured by

explosives everywhere

ZACH
Where are we going

SCARLETT

Half-asleep Scarlett yawns again Zach searches desperately
for the trap door He slips and FALLS ON SOME LOOSE CORN -

WES
Dude hurry

ZACH
Gee sorry Wes I thought Id

everywhere

Escaping the chaos outside THE GUINEA PIG SCURRIES into the
closet and STARTS EATING SOME OF THE LOOSE CORN

Wes and Kayla stare at him MOMENTARILY MESMERIZED by the
FRANTIC KINDRED SPIRIT Just then Scarlett stumbles -

KAYLA
How many pills did you give her

WES
Dont worry she cant OD on them

With that Scarlett PASSES OUT Wes and Kayla just manage to
catch her Until MACHINE GUN FIRE

And Wes FAINTS FROM FEAR As he drops Scarlett drops too
CUT TO

INT DINING ROOM

Hal now has a machine gun and a hand grenade

HAL
Where is Hafta Scarlett

Everyone looks around - unsure

Good point Hal looks momentarily at a loss
BACK TO
INT STORAGE ROOM

Kayla looks over to see the opening to a tunnel A
CLAUSTROPHOBICS NIGHTMARE -

There is a short silence and then -

ZACH (SINGING)

What is a balloon Why do children
love it so Its made of air - not

Kayla and Wes exchange a look but they keep crawling

ZACH (SINGING) (CONTD)

But the balloon man hell give you

Scarlett has STOPPED CRYING Kayla is actually GETTING
CALMER then A shard of light breaks through

Literally The light at the end of the tunnel

ZACH (SINGING) (CONT’D)
Of love Of hope

KAYLA
Oh - thank God

EXT SIDE OF THE ROAD

An embankment covered in leaves and mud And then - breaking
through A muddy arm And then a leg

Then the rest of the body - ZACH panting covered in mud
Fighting his way out Birth

Then SCARLETT crying through her emergence KAYLA panicked
and kissing the ground WES quiet in shock

They stand there for a moment looking at each other Then
Zach silently turns and starts walking down the road

No words need to be spoken THE OTHER THREE SIMPLY FOLLOW
DISSOLVE TO

CLOSE ON A HARD COVER BOOK in a store window The title of
the book - PIGEONS AT THE DUCK POND by Kayla Bachman

We are
EXT NEW YORK BOOKSTORE - SIX MONTHS LATER
Kayla eyes the book looking - for the first time - content

SCARLETT
Are you ready

REVEAL Scarlett SIX MONTHS PREGNANT

They turn the corner to a SMALL OFF-OFF-OFF-BROADWAY
THEATRE On the MARQUIS

BALLOON MAN - A TRAGI-COMIC MUSICAL IN SIX PARTS

Wes (CLEAN CUT and in MUCH BETTER PHYSICAL SHAPE) is waiting
for them in front He pats Scarletts belly

WES
Hows the little cult baby

SCARLETT
Stop calling him the cult baby He
was conceived in love
(beat)
Okay hes a cult baby

INT SMALL THEATRE
As Wes Scarlett and Kayla find seats A PIANIST warms up

A HALF-DRESSED CLOWN carries a CLUSTER OF BALLOONS across the
stage He places them in the corner and walks off

Just now LOUIS and JOY ENTER As they find seats -

JOY
Were here were here Your
father had to finish the chapter he
was working on

LOUIS
Its my fault of course

KAYLA
Guys
(turning around)
Its Zachs night

JOY
(genuine)
-Sorry Darling

From the wings Zach surveys the audience He sees his
family cluster And smiles

As the MUSIC STARTS Scarlett leans over to Kayla -

SCARLETT
I think this is going to be really
good
Kayla smiles And as the LIGHTS DIM we PULL OUT of the
theatre into the street up into the night sky
Higher HIGHER Past the skyline the clouds Until

were IN SPACE And there it is THE VESSEL

In ALL ITS GLORY Making its way through the galaxy We
MOVE IN through the window

CULT MEMBER 1
(peering out the window)
I cant see anything

CULT MEMBER 2
Let me look

CULT MEMBER 1
No way I called the window seat

From behind them -

CULT MEMBER 3
Are we almost there Im hungry

CULT MEMBER 4
Quit crowding me You keep
stepping on my foot

HAL

Thats enough Dont make me turn
this vessel around

And scurrying across the floor - panicked looking for an
escape from the insanity - THE GUINEA PIG

Over the sounds of arguing we MOVE IN ON HIM His nervous
twitching nose CLOSER CLOSER until we -

FADE OUT

THE END
