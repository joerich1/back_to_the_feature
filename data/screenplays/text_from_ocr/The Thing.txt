THE THING

THE MAIN COMPOUND OF US OUTPOST 31

The interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways
passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and com-
partments within the compound Sturdy but prefabricated
materials have been used in its construction

There is a laboratory An infirmary A kitchen and mess
hall A communications room and sleeping quarters Other
cubicles are for storage and supplies

The most spacious area of the building and the main center
of activity is the Rec Room Of the many entrance ways

to this room can be seen the small work chambers with their
sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment

The below quarter houses the generator and still other
compartments for storage

A long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the
dog kennel

pawing them imploring for safety

electronic chess game A large Mexican sombrero hangs on his
back He is tall about thirty-five His shack is sparse

but unkempt A few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed
by an occasional poster of some Mediterranean or South American
paradise

The chess game is of larger than normal size The pieces move
automatically with the press of a button He sits down and
chuckles over his opponents bad move

less of his visitor and makes his next move

More impatient pounding MacReady glares at his opponent
for a beat He bends forward Opens up a flap containing
the chess games circuitry and pours in his drink There
ensues a snapping popping sound as smoke and sparks rise
from the machine followed by a flush of chess gibberish

MacReady gets up from his seat mumbling on his way to the
door

door at the end cfthe corridor The sputtering static comes
from within

It widens enough for MacReady to see that a large computer-
like machine is blocking their path MacReady wedges in and
shines the flashlight

It is the communications room Holes in its roof have allowed
in the freezing cold The flashlight exposes the back of the
radio chair One more nudge allows them into the room

lantern We lights it with a match Holds it up The
brighter light exposes the top of a mans head sitting in the

in blanched death A gaping black hole for a mouth His
throat and wrists slit An old-fashioned straight razor in
his lap

the constantly moving ice underneath The evidence of fire
has further weakened the foundations The wood creaks over-
head Bits of ice and silt trickle down

The two men walk haunched cautious MacReady gingerly tries
to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam He
brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning
roof

The two men wait until it subsides and then move on

Further down MacReadys knee bumps into something along
the wall causing him to stumble slightly He shines his
light on it

An arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off
the ground The door has been slammed shut The arm pinned
its fist still gripping a small welding torch The flame
long since gone out

Holy shit

He tries the door Unlocked It opens The arm drops to

Its owner is nowhere to be seen

Moving along they come to rest in front of a door with

of ice Fifteen feet long Six feet wide Four feet tall

It has partially melted but its thawing process has been
stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost

Its one curious feature the middle has been thawed and
scuppered out Giving it the appearance of a large bathtub
The two men study it uncomprehendingly

MacReadys gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left
He moves for a closer look Several photographs are pasted
to its door Small snapshots of the Norwegians at work and

play

He tries to open it Stuck The partially caved-in ceiling
is slightly blocking the top of the door He tries again
careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above Bits of
dust float down

DR COPPER
Watch it

His grip is too strong It gives suddenly unexpectedly The
large metal door flies open

Large chunks splash from the ceiling They come thumping to
the floor behind and in front of the open cabinet door
MacReady coughs and waves away the dust He peers inside
Nothing much Some empty shelves Some small scientific gear

His flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the
inside of the cabinet door

It is a picture of five Norwegians arm in arm all smiles
toasting each other They are on either side of the frozen
block of ice pridefully displaying it for the camera The
block looks much thicker Its interior opaque

to see

INT INFIRMARY

Dr Copper and MacReady begin dumping the heavy contents of
a large plastic trash bag onto the slab

DR COPPER
We found this

Displayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a
man Badly charred What is left of the trousers and shoes
of the bottom torso are ripped and split as if his legs and
feet had burst from the inside His upper body is an almost
undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush

The head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal
It is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen
Tendon-like appendages are wrapped around the carcass and
sticking up and out in odd postures One is wrapped around
the bodys left leg

The shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tar-like
mess

The men grimace

DR COPPER
(continuing)
I know hes pretty badly burned
but could fire have done this

Blair sickened but fascinated pokes at the tendon-like
things and the tarry goo

to be an enormous flat glacier They are spread out crn the
ice around a large odd oval shape their arms outstretched

It fades to black and then a Norwegian comes on mugging child-
ishly in front of the camera apparently quite pleased with
something

The tape fades to black again and the picture reappears This
time they have marked off the large oval area with flag sticks

“ Closer shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into

the ice There is a small patch of something dark and metallic
at the bottom

MacReady leans forward intrigued

The men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various
points around the markings MacReady squints and mumbles to
himself

Nauls rips away his bindings The other two stand guard
Childs scrambles off the couch and onto the floor

GARRY 219

stares grimly ahead Childs soaks his clothing with a can of
gasoline He is then surrounded The room tenses adrenalin
pumps breathing halts

The burner The torches The wire The plate Garrys face

Hisssss

MacReady tries it again Hiss The men breathe Their torches
are lowered Naulis throws his on the floor Sanchez and Childs
flop down in chairs MacReady wipes his face

A long silence Sanchez weeps quietly with relief

GARRY
I know you gentlemen have been
through a lot But when you find
the timeId rather not spend the
rest of the winter tied to this couch

A beat Childs starts to giggle The strain on MacReadys
jaw begins to lessen Garry sits catatonic Nauls scowls at
Childs uncontrollable laughter

The infectious rasping causes MacReady a slight smile as he
looks up taking comfort in the sound of the raging Antarctic
wind vibrating the roof Nauls untying Garry grumbles at
Childs

NAULS
Shut the damn hell up

Childs wipes his eyes and grins over toward MacReady His
smile faded MacReady is now stone-face Childs grin goes
stale in sudden realization

EXT COMPOUND - NIGHT

The wind rumbles The storm is at its peak MacReady -
Childs and Nauls guided by their flares pull themselves
along the steadying rope headed for Blairs shack

BLAIRS SHACK

The door is wide open They pause by the entrance trying
to balance against the wind They enter

INT BLAIRS SHACK

Empty A few of the floorboards are loosened They pull
them up They stare down into a large hole beneath the
planking Something is down there They pull up more
boards

The hole is some fifteen feet deep Its dimensions are the
same as the shack Its space is almost completely taken
up by some strange metallic object

Crudely fashioned a patchwork job but streamlined Sheets

of corrugated steel are visible but cut apart and welded
into the desired shapes The object appears to be un-
finished

NAULS
What is it

MAC READY
Everything thats been missing

CHILDS
Spaceship of some kind

Far off admidst the howling gale -- the screeching The
men jump MacReady lights the fuse as they make it to
the exit He tosses it in

EXT COMPOUND ALONG THE ROPE 22

The explosion echoes behind them The men pull along
Their heads jerk in circles searching into the blackness

Some twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down
severing the line The wind sends the men tumbling along
the ice Childs loosens the line and is blown away roll-
ing out of sight

MacReady and Nauls have lost their torches They pull
feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the
compound

The screeching closes in behind them MacReady loses his
grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building
He crawls along looking for an opening

Nauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel
He climbs down through the open stairwell

INT PLANT ROOM 224

MacReady has found the broken window He rolls through it
landing on the frozen plants below Something smashes at
the glass above his head trying to get in He sprints
for the door Fuchs frozen body is still pinned to it
with the ax MacReady grapples with the stiff torso which
blocks the knob

He finally gets it open and lets himself out slamming and

locking the door from the hall Fuchs body swings eerily
back and forth

A sharp red talon-like fingernail pierces ‘the top of the

Goor above Nauls head It saws downward quickly Black
goo drips through the siit The sawing obscured by the music

Sanchez eyes bulging points Nauls turns A claw rips
through the wood Nauls dives to the floor

In the opposite direction behind Sanchez another arm splits
through the door and the refrigerator extends itself five
feet and yanks Sanchez back as if he were a puppet

Sanchez struggles looking imploringly at Nauls He bites
down on his capsule Nauls takes off like a speed skater

He hits a straighaway

SANCHEZS BODY 238

from out of nowhere blasts through the hallway wall directly
in Nauls path A thick arm pins the body to the other side
Unable to stop Nauls skids out of control banging into the

sides of the wall his cyanide capsule flying out of his mouth

Whatever the rest of it is it starts to crumble through the
wall Nauls dives over the arm somersaults to his feet and
takes off

Bet the last place you ever go

The sound of a door opening and closing Far off Another
creaking door is opened A rustling Still far off MacReady
and Nauls spread further apart

The soft bubbling cooling sound A slight scratch at the
door Garrys hand tightens around the generator switches
The scratching gets more pronounced MacReady cautions Garry
with a whisper

MAC READY
Wait

The door begins to pound from the outside Nauls and MacReady
light two cocktails each

The door booms The rooms foundations shake The ceiling
quivers The gas bombs are cocked

From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst Stunned
the men stumble back MacReady throws his gas bomb Nauls
the same

For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame Enormous
Grotesque

Garry bolts for the main door The Things tongue spirals
from his mouth and spears him The good two-thirds of its
body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door

Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground MacReady dodges still
another appendage dives on the generators and throws the
switch

The current rips through the door Garry dies instantly

One of The Things talons still caught in the door sends
it writhing in pain It literally rips the door from its
latchings and pounds it to the ground trying to shake it
loose Nauls hobbles scrambles out of the opening

MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm

the distant sound of a motor Nauls battered and bloodied
his leg apparently broken crawls along the ground Another
sound a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear
But closing

The terror forces him to drag faster oblivious to the pain

Ne reaches the bathroom stall Crawls in Locks it The
gurgling nears Leaning on the toilet seat he looks about
himself frantically

The Presence pauses at the door A scratching WNauls’ paws
rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood cutting his
fingers as he tries to break it off the siding

A strong blow begins to breach the stall door Nauls finally

unhinges the piece of wood brings the jagged end to one side
of his throat and rips

INT LAB WALL 243
The motorized rumbling nears The wall seems to exvlode

The tractor barrels into the lab Its enormous shovel
scooper tearing half the room to shreds

MacReady drives His eyes glint like a wild mans he looks
stark raving mad

His frostbite now in an advanced stage resembles black war
paint He clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth
like a buccaneers cutlass Two large compressed air tanks
have been tied together at the top and are draped around his
neck They are marked -- HYDROGEN They are used for the
weather balloons

He pulls the tractor to a stop yanks the stick from his
mouth grins and bellows

MAC READY

Okay creep Just you and me now

Be on your toes Were going to

do a little remodeling
MacReady guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary
Medical equipment goes flying The machine is powerful the
prefabricated walls buckling under its force
INT COMPOUND 244
A trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend
Boom
MacReady rams into the mess hall sweeping away tables chairs
He sings out loud the lyrics of some Mexican song All the

while he keeps his eyes on everything

Through the kitchen The foundation crumbling He sings on

NARROW PASSAGEWAY 245

Gurgling and hissing A taloned arm slinks around a corner
in retreat

area He backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from

the bar

He takes a drink and rams through another wall

INT REC ROOM

The tractor blazes into the rec room MacReady parks it
directly in front of the hole in the roof created by The
Thing when it surprised them earlier

MAC READY
Damn it ran out of gas

He pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over
the tractor As he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing
from roof to doorways to rubble

Wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes stinging

MacReady with the cold He winces at his mittenless blackened

fingers

MAC READY
(continuing)
Sweetheart its going to get
mighty cold in here soonYou
better make your moveI mean
hell Im only one person

He takes a swig from his bottle

MAC READY
(continuing)
I know youre bugged because we
ruined your trip right Spiffy
little toy you had there

A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears He looks up through
the hole then around He lights a lighter and cups it in
his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap

the room

MAC READY

Come on sucker

The tractor inches up off the ground MacReady falls forward
and looks straight down through the chassis and into the vile
and grinning face below A claw flashes up splitting the
steering wheel but missing his face

He depresses the ignition bolting the tractor forward ten
feet He jumps hanging onto the edge of the hole in the
ceiling The Things face and arms burst through the metal
plating of the tractor The reaching claws just miss him as
he pulls himself through

EXT ROOF 248
He lights his fuse drops in the stick turns and runs

Half of The Things grotesque and angular torso bolts up
through the hole howling in fury An appendage springs out-
ward and winds around MacReadys jacket hissing like acid ©
into the fabric

An immense explosion The hydrogen tanks send a white fire-
bali fifty feet into the sky The Things body disintegrating
almost immediately

The force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof He and
the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames He
rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear ofi
the insidious limb

He looks as weak as MacReady A beat

MAC READY

from under the table and places it beside him on top
