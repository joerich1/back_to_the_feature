FADE IN
INT OXFORD STREET MATERNITY HOSPITALBIRTHING ROOM -- NIGHT

A basement room Makeshift Bombproof Power battles to light
an overhead bulb often failing plunging the room into
darkness

A WOMAN WITH RED HAIR (JULIA) 26 lies dishevelled and

exhausted on a threadbare bed Night-gown torn and matted to
her body with sweat She clasps a NEW BORN BABY to her chest
tightly swaddled silent with new life

A STRIKING WOMAN (MIMI) 37 tends to her quietly and
efficiently - bathing her forehead with freshly soaked
bandages In the flickering light we gradually make out the
resemblance - sisters

JULIA
Is the doctor coming back

MIMI
(another bomb hits)
I dont think so

MIMI re-soaks turns back to find JULIA with her eyes closed
MIMI (CONTD)
(soft)

Julia

MIMI checks her breathing her pulse then gently maneuvers
the BABY from his mothers arms into her own

MIMI (CONTD)

The colossal Graeco-Roman structure that dominates the city-
centre Huge white pillars guarding the entrance Nothing and

no-one else around

Then in the distance someone weaving through the pillars
towards us a BOY in SCHOOL UNIFORM BLACK SHOES

FIFTEEN YEAR-OLD JOHN LENNON

The opening chorus line of the 1954 track Mr Sandman by
British crooner Dickie Valentine rings out

Rocknroll who

JOHN glances over his shoulder As though being chased by
hundreds of screaming girls But theres no girls and no
screaming Then just as hes about to burst down the lens
he trips and as he falls -

EXT LIVERPOOL CITY CENTREVARIOUS - DAY

- were looking up At white fluffy things and brilliant
blue And were moving floating along For a second colours
jolt into tangerine and marmalade

Mr Sandman still bung-bung-bung-in along

Then a heavy object falls fast through frame Could be a
person not sure - too quick too dark Slowly JOHN rises
into shot His hair struggling with the wind His face
enjoying the beating

CUT TO - St Georges Hall A DOUBLE DECKER BUS drives past
JOHN (still in school uniform) on top of it Surfing

CUT TO - The roof of the bus JOHN belting out Mr Sandman

JOHN
(singing)
Sandman Im so alone Dont have
nobody to call my own Please turn

The BUS suddenly in leafier environs Suburban It comes to a
screeching halt outside an austere looking black and white
house A sign - MENDIPS - on the front gate

on the edge of the bus
And with a sharp intake of breath steps off

And as we near we begin to notice the playing gets better
and better - the strings begin to make sense The tune
becomes more melodic until he too busts out singing
