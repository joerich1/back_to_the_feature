FADE IN
EXT USDB - DAWN 1

A lone JEEP drives the approach road to a massive military

facility a hulking dark presence set back behind a series
of fences Lights are still on glowing haloes of carbon-

arc yellow

MAN (VO)
The first castles were the walled
cities of Mesopotamia built over
8000 years ago Castles havent
changed much down the centuries
There have always been walls

The camera glides over the face of the OUTER WALL of the
facility -- built a hundred years ago it looks like it
could last ten thousand more

MAN (V0O) (contd)
and gates

The jeep slows at a fence gate by a sign reading CAC USDB
Authorized Personnel Only

MAN (VO) (contd)
and men to guard them

A SOLDIER steps out of the gate hut sees the driver of the
jeep and salutes The jeep rolis through

MAN (VO) (contd)
Castle walls have always held high
ground positions to fire from

A GUNMAN stands in a GUNTOWER high-powered rifle in his
arms

MAN (V0) (contd)
and places to run a flag

The first orange light of the day reaches the roof of the
Administration Building SOLDIERS in crisp practiced moves
unfold a FLAG hook it to a line and pull it up a flagpole

MAN (V0) (contd)
The only difference between this
castle and the countless others built
over the last 8000 years is that
they were built to keep people out

Karen Goldberg
INT THE TIERS - DAWN 2
Six floors of cells INMATES at the doors

MAN (V0)
This castle was built to keep people
in

Ahorn sounds the cell doors all slide open and the men
step out clutching towels and toothbrushes They all stop

in unison A VOICE barks out a command the men turn on
their heels and walk
EXT OFFICERS’ PARKING LOT - DAWN 3

The jeep drives up The door Opens and out gets COLONEL
WINTER 48 the Commandant of the USDB You could cut wood
with the crease on his pants He looks up at the flag and
the soldiers on the roof

The soldiers salute the flag turn on their heels

Winter heads toward the gate briefcase in hand

INT ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - SALLY PORT - DAWN 4
Winter is buzzed through a sally port SOLDIERS saluting him
as he goes He’s met on the other side by LT PERETZ 40
Peretz salutes

LT PERETZ
Good morning sir

COLONEL WINTER
Lieutenant

Winter returns salute Peretz hands him a cup of coffee and
they walk

COLONEL WINTER (cont d)

LT PERETZ
(off his clipboard)

hospital and 2 in PC

They turn and head up the stairs

Karen Goldberg
INT WINTERS OFFICE - DAWN 5

Winter and Peretz enter Prominent in the room is a glass
cabinet across one wall filled with artifacts of war The
blinds are drawn and the office is dark

LT PERETZ
on leave and C Company is at full
strength

Winter nods He tosses his briefcase onto his desk Peretz
opens the curtains revealing a view of

THE YARD

The central exercise area of the Castle (dirt running track
basketball hoops weight pile) The Yard is flanked by the
Administration Building the Tiers and the outer walls
INMATES are spilling out of the Tiers

LT PERETZ
One other thing sir The Hispanic
inmates are complaining theyre
receiving smaller portions than the
black inmates in the mess They
feel it’s due to the predominance of
black inmates on food service detail

Winter shakes his head as he looks out at the inmates in the
Yard

COLONEL WINTER
Another matter of life and death
(beat)
Get me their duty roster

INT MESS HALL - DAY 6

Lunch All the inmates serving up the food are LATINOS and
they are having a great time giving their pals huge servings
while doling out the minimum allowable amounts to the BLACKS
and WHITES One huge black inmate -- THUMPER -- is most
displeased by the small portions on his plate He yells at
the man behind the counter -- MIGUEL

THUMPER
You can’t feed a squirrel on that

LATINO FOOD SERVER
Thats regulation man

Karen Goldberg

LATINO FOOD SERVER (contd)
You got a problem you take it up
with the Colonel
(to next guy)
Hey ese You look hungry Here

Miguel slops down an extra helping on the guys plate
Thumper steams keeps moving

EXT THE YARD - DAY 7
INMATES spill out onto the Yard after lunch

Two guards -- SGT MCLAREN and PVT NIEBOLT -- are standing
near an ANCIENT STONE WALL in the middle of the Yard They
are handing out picks and sledgehammers to four white
prisoners BEAUPRE DARNELL WITTBRODT and TUCKER all ex-
Green Berets all mean sons-of-bitches

Beaupre grabs a sledgehammer and climbs a ladder to the top
of the wall He starts pounding on the top layer of stones
trying to break them loose

AGUILAR (0S)
The m-m-mortar is weak

Beaupre looks down at AGUILAR 22 a sweet-faced Latino

AGUILAR (contd)
M-m-maybe if you--

BEAUPRE
The fuck you doing taco

AGUILAR
M-m-my d-d-dad was a m-m-mason--

BEAUPRE
I d-d-don’t c-c-care if your d-d-dad
built the fucking pyramids beano
Whites work the wall spics move the
rocks niggers stack the rocks
That’sthe way it is Which means
Cheech get the fuck away from my
wall

Aguilar just stares at Beaupre Another Latino inmate --
ENRIQUEZ 50s -- steps up grabs Aguilar by the shoulder and
pulls him away They all hear a commotion across the Yard

Karen Goldberg

Fifty yards away THUMPER and MIGUEL are circling each other
cheered on by a circle of men

MIGUEL
You fucks serve us up portions the
size of pigeon shit and now you got
a problem

INT WINTERS OFFICE - DAY 8

Winter and Peretz are by the window looking down into the
Yard watching Thumper and Miguel circling each other

COLONEL WINTER
If you think about it this is really
an interesting example of stimulus
and response
(off Peretz’s look)
No matter what stimulus we create

the response is always the same It
always ends up in the Yard Different
actors in different parts of course
but the basic play doesn’t vary much
Someone should write a paper on it

Peretz nods Down below Thumper moves toward Miguel Peretz
raises his radio Winter motions him to hold up

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
Wait for it

Thumper pushes Miguel Winter motions Peretz to go ahead
COLONEL WINTER (contd)
No one in or out hospital squad in
reserve
Peretz speaks into his radio
LT PERETZ
Lock down all sally ports and Company
ist Platoon 2nd squad into reserve
EXT THE YARD - DAY 9
YATES 28 is standing apart from the crowd leaning against
the prison wall With him is JINX 25 a bony little punk
Yates sees Thumper and Miguel pushing each other He glances
up at Winter’s office

YATES
Go He’s gonna pull the squad

Karen Goldberg

JINX
You sure

YATES
Yes Go

Jinx hurries off

THUMPER and MIGUEL circle each other Miguel pulls a shiv
Someone tosses Thumper a five-pound weight tied to a length
of rope Thumper starts swinging it over his head

A couple other BLACK VS LATINO fights break out ONLOOKERS
back away in an ever-widening circle The GUARDS back away
as well No one looks very concerned

Over by the old stone wall McLaren and Niebolt gather up
the picks and sledgehammers toss them into a wheelbarrow

Yates starts toward the circle of on-lookers

YATES (contd)
Wholl give me odds

Dellwo and Cyrus turn

DELLWO

YATES

book)
The winner is whoevers got the most
men standing when the bell rings
Duffyll take the count

DUFFY a 22 year-old white kid nods
YATES (contd)
Based on numbers Id say it’s 3-
to-2 in favor of our Latin friends
Whos iri
INMATES around him start calling in bets

DELLWO

Karen Goldberg

YATES
Im not betting against anybody

DELLWO

YATES

Yates catches the eye of MCLAREN wheeling off the picks and
sledgehammers McLaren surreptitiously points at the Latinos
and holds up one finger Yates nods writes in his book

IN THE FIGHT a LATINO uses a weight bat to smack open a
horrible gash in the head of a BLACK INMATE

INT WINTERS OFFICE - DAY 10

Winter winces at the sight of the black inmate crumpling to
the ground

EXT THE YARD - DAY 11

Yates takes down some more bets Cyrus steps up to him

CYRUS
As much as I disapprove of the entire

Yates looks over at Thumper and Miguel still circling

YATES

Thumper across the chest Thumper howls

Cyrus frowns Yates shrugs

Karen Goldberg
11 11
YATES (contd)
(scribbles in book mutters)
Cyrus owes me two

CYRUS
Its not over yet Richard

YATES
You hang onto that optimism Cyrus
It works for you Anyone else

Thumper charges forward swings the weight low into the
side of Miguels knee with a horrible crunch Miguel goes
down screaming

Cyrus looks at Yates Yates frowns

YATES (contd)
Like you said its not over yet

Thumper gets the weight swinging again high over his head
Just then the rope snaps The weight goes flying through
the air Thumper watches it Everyone watches it Everyone
except

McLaren wheeling off the picks and sledgehammers

NIEBOLT
Sarge Look out

McLaren starts to turn The weight slams into his back
knocking him off his feet

Peretz comes in clutching a piece of paper

LT PERETZ

Winter arches an eyebrow

LT PERETZ (contd)
Guilty

Winter sighs shakes his head
COLONEL WINTER
I can’t believe they actually went
through with it
(beat)
When does he arrive
Peretz hands Winter the fax Winter is stunned

COLONEL WINTER (contd)

LT PERETZ

They say they’re expediting his
transfer -- as a courtesy

COLONEL WINTER

As a courtesy For Godsake they

INT LIBRARY - DUSK 19
The library windows afford a view of the front gates and the
approach road INMATES are crowded around all available
windows

Yates is at one window with Dellwo Cyrus and Duffy

DELLWO
Big fucking deal

CYRUS
It is

THEIR POV of the bus driving through the gates
CYRUS (0S) (contd)
This is the first time someone with
a rank above colonel has ever been
sent to the Castle
INT BUS - DUSK 20
A PRISONER is sitting in shadows face unseen halfway back

in a dark otherwise empty prisoner transport bus He’s in
leg and wrist chains looking out the window

HIS POV SOLDIERS on the roof taking down the flag and folding
it

INT LIBRARY - DUSK 21
The guys jostle for position at the window to get a look

DUFFY
What’d he do

DELLWO
What you think He fucked up -- big
time Why else do you think a five-
star generals gonna come to this
place Pirating cable

DUFFY
I know he fucked up Dell--

DELLWO
He was in Uganda on one of them UN
deals shot up a bunch of Tutus

Karen Goldberg

YATES
That’s it Dell You got it exactly
Except he’s a three-star general
not five it was Burundi not Uganda
and the tribes are the Hutus and the
Tutsis not the Tutus -- they’re not
ballerinas

CYRUS
And he didn’t shoot anybody He
went to rescue some Hutu moderates
after he was ordered to leave the
country

DUFFY
They sent him here for trying to
rescue some people

CYRUS
They sent him here because he
disobeyed orders

YATES
They sent him here because eight
American soldiers got killed

DUFFY
Shit He get the Tutus out
CYRUS
Hutus
DUFFY

Hutus Fuck

CYRUS
No They were dead before he got
there At least he tried

DUFFY
You don’t think he shouldve been
convicted

CYRUS

No one does Not even the men who
convicted him They wanted to keep
it in house But once the story hit
the New York Times they had no
choice They couldn’t let it slide

Dellwo strains to get a look out the window

Karen Goldberg 21

DELLWO
Let’s see what a living fucking pinky
legend looks like

EXT PRISONER RECEPTION GATE - DUSK 22

The bus pulls up stops The door opens and the PRISONER
steps out shackled We still don’t see his face GUARDS
nod and the prisoner starts toward the gate shuffling

INT LIBRARY - DUSK 23

They watch the prisoner walk inside Dellwo and the others
ease back from the window nothing more to see

DUFFY
There must be some other stockade
they could put him

CYRUS
There isn’t Right Dell You know
why You love officers

DELLWO
I hate officers

YATES
I was an officer

DELLWO
I hate you

CYRUS

(to Duffy)

If an officer is convicted of a crime
there’s only one place he can go
and that is right here

INT RECEIVING ROOM - NIGHT 24

The PRISONER stands naked his back to us In front of him
are MCLAREN and NIEBOLT both uncomfortable McLaren holds
green prison uniform coveralls going through a routine

MCLAREN
unless special allowance is made
by a senior watch officer due to
weather concerns If a prisoner is
found to be wearing outer clothing
other than a uniform the clothing
will be confiscated and the prisoner

(MORE)

Karen Goldberg

24 24

MCLAREN (contd)
will receive discipline Though it
will bear the prisoner’s name for
laundry identification purposes the
uniform is the property of the
Department of Defense and any attempt
to alter it color it or in any way
modify or damage it will also result
in discipline

(beat very uncomfortable)
Before you can uh put on your
uniform you must be checked for
contraband

(to Niebolt)

Private Niebolt

Niebolt doesn’t move

MCLAREN (contd)
Private Niebolt check the prisoner
for contraband

Niebolt still doesn’t move McLaren shoots him a look -- he
has no choice Niebolt steps forward

PVT NIEBOLT
The uh prisoner will uh turn
and uh grab the bar and place his
feet on the floor markings

The prisoner turns and grabs the bar We get our first good
look at

GENERAL LELAND IRWIN short-cropped hair and piercing eyes
Irwin positions his feet on the floor

Niebolt starts putting on a rubber glove shaking his head
McLaren gives him a look -- just do it Niebolt steps
forward

GENERAL IRWIN
May I ask a favor

PVT NIEBOLT
(stops)
A favor

SGT MCLAREN
What

Karen Goldberg 24

GENERAL IRWIN
When you speak about this -- and you
will -- be kind

Niebolt and McLaren are startled for a moment then laugh
The door swings open Peretz enters

LT PERETZ
Skip the search Sergeant give him
his uniform

Between Niebolt and Irwin it’s hard to tell who’s more
relieved

INT WINTERS OFFICE - NIGHT 25
THE FLAG lays folded on Winters desk

IRWIN now in green USDB coveralls looks over Winter’s

collection of war memorabilia A tap at the door Peretz
swings the door open announces

LT PERETZ
Colonel Winter

Winter enters looks at Winter

COLONEL WINTER
I know what you’re wondering Do
you salute me do I salute you No
to both My men salute me of course
and each other according to rank
but there’s no saluting by the
population

Irwin nods

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
Hungry

GENERAL IRWIN
No

COLONEL WINTER
You sure Thursdays are Salisbury
steak night

GENERAL IRWIN
Always a reason for celebration

Karen Goldberg

25

COLONEL WINTER
Indeed Could I at least interest
you in some lemonade

GENERAL IRWIN
Thank you

Winter nods to Peretz Peretz leaves

COLONEL WINTER
If you step over here I can give you
the basic layout of the facility

Irwin joins Winter at the window They look into the Yard

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
Were in the Administration Building
Those buildings across the Yard are
the Tiers where the inmates live
That long low building over there
is where the workshops and the laundry
are

Winter notices Irwin looking at the old half broken-down
stone wall in the middle of the Yard

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
That’s the old blockhouse wall
It’s all that remains of the original
building where the first prisoners
stayed back in the 1870s We
noticed the wall was leaning earlier
this year so I asked the men to
take it down rebuild the foundation
put it back up They enjoy working
on it gives them something to do
It’s become a matter of some pride

The door opens Aguilar enters with two glasses of lemonade
gives them to Winter and Irwin

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
Thank you Mr Aguilar

Aguilar nods leaves Silence for a moment as Irwin and
Winter sip their lemonade

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
Back in ‘74 I waited in line for an
hour to hear you speak at West Point

Karen Goldberg

25 “25

GENERAL IRWIN
Oh God What did I say

COLONEL WINTER
I don’t know I didn’t get in

GENERAL IRWIN
‘74 I was still giving my bugs
and thugs talk
(off Winter’s look)
My POW experiences The NVA
interrogators were thugs and we ate
bugs to survive Bugs and thugs

COLONEL WINTER

(grins then)
I remember my friends who heard you
that day were quite impressed They
all wanted to follow in your
footsteps Who didn’t We all wanted
the combat career
Of course you make some choices
take some assignments and the next
thing you know

Winter stops afraid he’s revealed too much Switches gears

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
We don’t have much time tonight I’m
afraid -- it’s lights out in a few
minutes I uh I can’t comment
on why you’re here of course
Whatever my personal feelings may be
on the matter are irrelevant Youre
here and well just have to make the
best of it

Irwin nods

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
I meet personally with every new
inmate usually downstairs soon
after they arrive I always ask
them aquestion -- the same question
Im going to ask you What do you
expect here at the Castle

GENERAL IRWIN
(thinks)
Nothing

Winter looks at him unclear

Karen Goldberg

25 “25

GENERAL IRWIN (contd)

I just want to do my time and go

home
COLONEL WINTER

Perfect That is the perfect answer

Lieutenant Peretz

A beat then Peretz enters

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
Gather up Mr Aguilar

Peretz nods leaves Winter turns to Irwin awkward
COLONEL WINTER (contd)
I have what given the circumstances
might seem a bizarre request
(Irwin arches an eyebrow)
I have a collection of most of the
seminal books on warfare including
your book on the evolution of battle
strategy I was wondering if you
would sign it

GENERAL IRWIN
Certainly Of course

Winter nods Peretz reenters with Aguilar

COLONEL WINTER
Just a moment Lieutenant

Winter exits Peretz Aguilar and Irwin are alone in the
room Irwin holds up the lemonade glass to Aguilar nods
his thanks

Aguilar flustered nods Irwin sets the glass down goes
to look at Winter’s collection of war memorabilia

INT WINTERS OFFICE - NIGHT 29

LT PERETZ

GENERAL IRWIN
A few coins from countries I’ve been

collections and it stuck with me

INT WINTERS OFFICE - OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT 30
Winter holds Irwins book as he heads back toward his office
INT WINTERS OFFICE - NIGHT 31

GENERAL IRWIN
(gruff voice as his father)
The only kind of man who has a
collection like this is a man whos
never set foot on a battlefield

INT WINTERS OFFICE - OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT 32

Winter is frozen having heard what Irwin just said He
doesn’t know what to do He reaches for the doorknob stops

GENERAL IRWIN (0S)
(gruff)
To him a minie-ball from Shiloh is
just an interesting artifact Toa
combat vet its a hunk of metal
that probably caused some poor bastard
a world of pain

Winter turns on his heel and heads back down the hall toward
the bookshelves

Karen Goldberg

33 INT WINTERS OFFICE - NIGHT 33
GENERAL IRWIN
(to Peretz)
of course my old man was a complete
fraud After he died I found his
collection in the attic -- Kraut
helmet Luger Nazi flag
(re item in case)
Look at that From Appomatox
Irwin looks at Peretz -- may I Peretz nods -- go ahead
Irwin slides back the glass and picks up an old bayonet
He’s turning it over in his hands when the door opens and
Winter comes back in
COLONEL WINTER
Couldn’t find it -- your book
Must’ve been misshelved
Irwin shrugs Winter notices the bayonet in Irwins hands
Irwin sees something in Winters eyes moves to put the
bayonet back
COLONEL WINTER (contd)
I1l do that
oo GENERAL IRWIN
It’s no--
COLONEL WINTER
(firmly)
I’ll do it
Irwin freezes Winter softens takes the bayonet from him
COLONEL WINTER (contd)
I’m going to be boxing it all up
anyway Ive grown tired of it
(to Peretz)
Youd better be going
Peretz nods gestures for Irwin to leave Irwin starts for
the door -
Aguilar salutes
Winters face goes very dark
COLONEL WINTER (contd)
- Mr Aguilar what are you doing
oo

Karen Goldberg

33 33
Aguilar immediately drops his hand

AGUILAR
I-I--

COLONEL WINTER
Prisoner Aguilar whatever our
personal feelings on the matter may
be Prisoner Irwin is no longer a
general In fact he holds no rank
whatsoever

Saluting him is not only no longer
required it is in fact prohibited
Are we clear on that

AGUILAR
Yes sir but--

COLONEL WINTER
But what Prisoner

AGUILAR
I-I was saluting you

Winter is frozen for a moment then shakes his head
COLONEL WINTER
Not necessary
(to Peretz)
You’d better hurry
Peretz nods
GENERAL IRWIN
Thank you for your hospitality
Colonel

COLONEL WINTER
Don’t mention it

Peretz Irwin and Aguilar head out Winter watches them go

INT WINTERS OFFICE - NIGHT 35
Winter stands at his window looking down into the Yard

He sees Aguilar running across the Yard A few moments later

As Winter watches Irwin and Peretz he absentmindedly plays
with something in his hands He notices what he’s holding

in disgust

friends high up in the Pentagon
right

GENERAL IRWIN
Not many Why

boc
We were hoping you could talk to
someone

GENERAL IRWIN
About what

boc
About what it’s like here The truth

ENRIQUEZ
It’s a real fucking jungle in here
vato and it isn’t an accident
Winter sets us against each other --
black vs brown brown vs white --
keeps things stirred up As soon as
it starts dying down he starts
fanning and blowing and boom it’s
running hot again

GENERAL IRWIN
Let me get this straight There is
violence in a place filled with
convicted criminals

ENRIQUEZ
I told you this was pointless

CYRUS

(to Irwin)
It’s not just that the Colonel
instigates violence he also provides
substandard services If anyone
gets injured -- in a fight he’s
provoked -- they’re on their own
Doc spends half his time stitching
people up

GENERAL IRWIN
“He provides substandard services”
(MORE)

Karen Goldberg “48

GENERAL IRWIN (contd)
You want to talk about “substandard
services” My first year in Hanoi
I had a friend who had to treat
himself for a compound fracture

boc
You can’t compare--

GENERAL IRWIN
Thats right you cant compare
This is summer camp And youre
youre whining

Irwin shakes his head rises starts out

CYRUS
(sotto)
There have been murders

Irwin slows a half-step

CYRUS (contd)
By Colonel Winter and his men

Irwin looks back

Doc
Sometimes when theres a fight in
the Yard an inmate will make a
mistake and touch a guard You do
that you get shot

CYRUS
Usually it’s just rubber bullets

boc
But sometimes it’s not Three times
in the past two years there’s been
a “mix-up” and real builets have
been used

ENRIQUEZ
And wouldn’t you know it the three
guys who died were all guys Winter’d
been having trouble with

boc
You may say the rest of it’s whining

but someone needs to look intothese
deaths

Karen Goldberg

They look

CYRUS
Weve tried but no one listens to
us After all we’re just a bunch
of convicted criminals

at Irwin imploring Irwin looks back at them

GENERAL IRWIN

Three years ago in Bosnia I was
driving through an IFOR town and I
saw an old man sitting on the steps
of his house with a child I presume
was his grandson playing dominoes
and I had a revelation All my life
in the Army through good wars and
bad Id been doing my best to make
dangerous parts of the world safe
enough so old men could sit on their
steps and play games with their
grandchildren It was not entirely
selfless of course I loved the
work with all my heart I gave a
great deal for it I lost a wife
due to neglect I ama stranger to
my daughter I have a grandson I
have never met

(beat)
When I saw that old man in Bosnia I
didn’t begrudge him his game with
his grandson I simply thought “My
turn” Now I didn’t retire after
Bosnia I should have but I didn’t
I took one last assignment To
Burundi And here I am

(beat)
Im done gentlemen I’m not fighting
anyone or anything ever again I’m
going to do my time then I’m going
to go home and God willing sit on
my front steps and play a game of
dominoes with my grandson

And with that Irwin walks out Enriquez is pissed Doc is

Okay

Irwin can see the truth -- the pain -- in Aguilars eyes

GENERAL IRWIN
So tell me along with the stutter
do you have some kind of spinal
deformity A curvature some
misaligned vertebrae

AGUILAR
No

GENERAL IRWIN
Then why are you standing like that
I said “at ease not slouch

Aguilar straightens up
GENERAL IRWIN (contd)
And what was that thing you did with
your hand

AGUILAR
Scuse me

GENERAL IRWIN
It looked like you were running your

fingers through your hair and they
got stuck

Karen Goldberg 53

AGUILAR
What Oh no -- that was a salute

GENERAL IRWIN
It was A salute Really

AGUILAR
What wag wrong with it

GENERAL IRWIN
Do you know why we salute

AGUILAR
To show respect

GENERAL IRWIN
Okay but why a salute Why this
thing with the hand

That stumps Aguilar

GENERAL IRWIN (contd)
The truth is the hand is almost
immaterial A salute is basically a
frozen wave
(demonstrates)
Its as if youre waving at someone
and you stop you hold it Thats

the sign of respect Not the fact
you have your hand up but that you’re
not moving Youre staying still
for that person giving them your
attention

(beat)
A proper salute starts at your feet

As Irwin starts instructing Aguilar how to salute we PAN

The guy in the hut three doors down

INT GENERAL IRWINS CELL - NIGHT 69
Irwin is soaking his aching raw hands in his sink

YATES You know betting on yourself could
get you a lifetime ban from the Hall
of Fame

Irwin smiles turns sees Yates

GENERAL IRWIN
Mr Aguilar

Aguilar at the door Irwin nods at the cigarettes

GENERAL IRWIN (contd)
If you wouldnt mind pass those out
as far as theyll go I don’t smoke

AGUILAR
Thank you sir The menll appreciate
it

Aguilar takes the cigarettes leaves

YATES
One thing Ive got to know When
you fell and cut your head did you
do that just to drive up the odds

GENERAL IRWIN
Why would I do a thing like that

YATES
To shut down my book

GENERAL IRWIN
And why would I want to shut down
your book

YATES
Because you know Im running a suicide
pool on you

GENERAL IRWIN
Ah yes I heard about that Are
there any squares left

Karen Goldberg

69 69

YATES
Just one Nine weeks

GENERAL IRWIN
How much to enter

YATES
Nope sorry Knowing you youd
kill yourself just to win a box of
smokes

GENERAL IRWIN
Never Im like Pete Rose if I bet
on myself its always to win

YATES
But you dont always win

GENERAL IRWIN
God no

A moment of quiet Yates is about to leave but stops

YATES
I met you once when I was a kid
(Irwin looks at him)
1981 The belated Welcome Home
ceremony at the White House I was
there My father was one of your
men In Hanoi

GENERAL IRWIN
I dont recall any Yates

YATES
My mothers name My dad was Richard
Andrews They split when I was a
teenager I took her name

GENERAL IRWIN
Richard Andrews He was a good
man

YATES
No he wasnt You know that

GENERAL IRWIN
After thirty years everyones a

good man It’s a law Where’s your
father now

Karen Goldberg 69

YATES

Crawling with worms I suppose

(off Irwins look)
He died in 87 He was in a bar
fight got hit in the head He
thought he was okay went back to
his shithole motel room and went to
bed Trouble was his blood was so
thin from drinking it couldnt clot
right anymore and he bled to death
in his sleep

GENERAL IRWIN
Im sorry

YATES
Yeah well it is your fault
(off Irwins look)
The men who were with you in Hanoi --
to a man they all Say you kept them
alive Your strength

Irwin shakes his head

YATES (contd)
I kinda wish you hadnt been so
strong Maybe my dad wouldve died
over there At least then we wouldve
had that -- he wouldve died a hero
not a sad pathetic skid row drunk

GENERAL IRWIN
I am not responsible for those men
surviving

YATES
Thats not what they say

GENERAL IRWIN
When you are tortured the first
thing they try to do is break down
your sense of self
I broke quickly Within weeks self-
preservation was the last thing on
my mind In fact I prayed for death
Every night The only thing that
kept me from answering those prayers
myself was the thought of the men in
the other rooms They kept me alive
Mr Yates not the other way around

The horn sounds

EXT THE YARD - DAY 70

A LINE OF MEN stretches from the stone pile to the wall as
they move the stones Their hands work with quick practiced
precision and the stones fly along the line

At the wall AGUILAR oversees closely as the stones are
carefully stacked and slathered with mortar to form the new
wall

Irwin walks out of the Tiers heads for the wall As he
passes inmates many of them “salute” him as Aguilar did by
running their fingers through their hair

DELLWO
Morning Chief

OTHER INMATES
Hey Chief Good morning Chief

Someone taps Aguilar on the shoulder He turns sees Irwin
walking up Aguilar and all the men around him “salute”

INT WINTERS OFFICE - DAY 71
Winter and Peretz stand at the window

LT PERETZ
The hand through the hair is their
form of salute They address Irwin
as Chief They have substitutes for
other ranks as well Anyone who
was a Captain is called Boss
Sergeants are Sport and Privates
are Pal

COLONEL WINTER
(thinks nods)
Take their names
Peretz nods lifts binoculars starts jotting down names

EXT THE YARD - DUSK 72

Aguilar and the fifty or so inmates who were stacking the
stones are standing before Winter who stands on the
Administration Building steps Peretz waits behind hin

COLONEL WINTER
There may be many times in a soldiers

career when he will be required to
(MORE)

Karen Goldberg
72

ta COLONEL WINTER (contd)
salute a man for whom he has no
respect He salutes anyway because
he has been taught to salute the
rank not the man There will
hopefully however be many more
instances than that in a soldiers
career when he happily salutes not
only the rank but the man who carries
it When we who are soldiers see
greatness in a man -- see all the
qualities we attribute to those few
we call heroes -- then it is not
only our duty to salute it is our
honor and our privilege That is
what we do we who are soldiers
that is who we are and I understand
that
(beat)
What I do not understand is how you
could think that any of that applies
to you You are not soldiers

e i ng r the inma

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
Each one of you is nothing more than
om the shadow of a soldier “You have
the shape of a soldier but you have
no substance You once were a
soldier but now you merely mark the
space where a soldier once stood
(gestures to prison walls)
And so we lock you away out of the
light And real soldiers
(gestures to Peretz McLaren)
are called upon to contain you
to keep you from bringing more shame
to the uniform they wear

Winter looks at them for a moment longer then turns and

goes inside Peretz takes his place

LT PERETZ
The prisoners present will return to
their cells to commence a seventy-
two hour lockdown

Aguilar and the other fifty men whod been in lockdown walk
out onto the Yard As they approach the almost-finished
blockhouse wall the men already there start clapping

INT WINTERS OFFICE - DUSK 79

Winter stands at his window looking down at Aguilar and the
others by the wall

COLONEL WINTER
It’s sad but they just don’t get
it do they Apparently the irony
of prisoners building their own
prisons escapes them

GENERAL IRWIN (OS)
No they get it

Winter turns Irwin is standing in the middle of the room

GENERAL IRWIN (contd)
They just don’t care It gives them
something to do

Winter stares at Irwin for a long moment

COLONEL WINTER
So Mr Irwin what do you want

GENERAL IRWIN
I want to do my time and go home

COLONEL WINTER
So you say and yet everything youve
done here contradicts that
(beat)
What do you want for them The
ability to salute use rank What

GENERAL IRWIN
I think I want the same thing you do --
that they should be better men going
out of here than they were coming
in

COLONEL WINTER
That’s the line my predecessor used

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
In his last two years here there
were seven escape attempts and twelve
injury assaults on an officer
including one killed In the ten
yearssince I assumed command there
have been zero escape attempts zero
injury assaults zero officer

Some may question my
ways Mr Irwin but they work

See in case youve forgotten those
men down there are not here for unpaid
parking tickets and library fines

Mr Beaupre and his cronies raped

and murdered a young woman in a
parking lot in Manila Mr Dellwo
robbed a PX with a shotgun blew a
poor corporal’s hand off Your
beloved Mr Aguilar almost killed an
MP with a claw hammer

GEN

ERAL IRWIN

I labor under no illusions about
what these men have done I just
think they could occasionally be
reminded of the best thing they did
in their lives rather than having to
only think of the worst

spend every day behind enemy lines
Because make no mistake about ait

they are the enemy you are the
enemy and I will not have any terms
dictated to me by the enemy There
will be no saluting in any form
whatsoever There will be no sneaking
around the prohibition of rank I

as it seems to have become a focus
of much tension and turmoil

in a couple of minutes there
will be no wall

the completed wall Cyrus shakes his head Aguilar looks
at him -- what
CYRUS

I’m afraid I’ve never quite

understood It goes nowhere encloses

nothing doesn’t support anything

Its it’s just a wall

AGUILAR
Yeah But it’s our wall

Cyrus grins nods And then they hear a sound and turn
THE TRUCK GATES

Are opening across the Yard Everyone looks They hear a
rattling rumble and then

A BULLDOZER
Comes through the open gates It heads for the men and the
blockhouse wall No one knows what to make of it And then

TWO DOZEN GUARDS including Niebolt and McLaren run out
flank the bulldozer batons ready

The men boo jeer but move back from the advancing guards

Aguilar doesn’t back away He starts walking toward the
bulldozer

MCLAREN (contd)
Dont do it Aguilar

But Aguilar doesn’t stop Niebolt runs out grabs Aguilar

NIEBOLT
Don’t

Aguilar pushes Niebolt away

A ripple of fear goes through the men

bulldozer slows stops Aguilar grins starts to turn to
look back at the others CRACKCRACKCRACK Aguilar jerks
from three bullet hits to the chest He looks surprised
more than pained He falls face forward to the ground

Silence for a moment Aguilar doesn’t move And then dark
wet stains start to blossom on his back

Oh fuck Doc

Doc scrambles to Aguilar rolls him over and we see the torn
cloth of the bullet strikes and his deg tags covered in
blood

Oh Jesus

INT WINTERS OFFICE - DAY 85

Winter looks at Irwin with an expression that says “see what
you made me do”

COLONEL WINTER

They should only be using rubber
bullets I can’t imagine how
something like this could happen

(to Peretz)
Look into it Lieutenant I’11 expect
a full report on my desk by Monday

Winter stunned now fully seeing the depth of Winter’s
darkness

INT THE TIERS - DAYNIGHT 86

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES shows the men sitting out the 72 hour

But as day becomes night becomes day again they quiet down
take their meals sit in silence

INT THE TIERS - DAY 87
A horn sounds and all the cell doors slide open
EXT THE YARD - DUSK 88

A light rain falls The blockhouse wall is gone The only
sign it was ever there is a strip of new earth where the
foundation was dug out

300 inmates are in the Yard scattered across it back to
their racial divisions The mood is quiet

INT WINTERS OFFICE - DUSK 89
Winter looks down from his window Peretz by his side

jungle

Winter turns and goes to his desk Peretz stays by the
window

of new earth for a few moments then he turns to the men

behind him

At that the 300 men scattered randomly across the Yard move
and start to form a grid Even BEAUPRE and HIS MEN step
into line

The grid forms up into crisp even lines filling half the
Yard The men stand at attention

Irwin nods to Doc Doc steps out of line walks up to Irwin
holds out his hand In his hand are DOG TAGS smeared with
dark dry blood Irwin takes them Doc returns to his line

Irwin kneels scoops up some dirt with his hand and buries
the tags He pats the earth flat stands He looks out at
the men

GENERAL IRWIN

Some might think to be remembered in
this way would be a disgrace to a
soldier but there is no disgrace in
this The greatest monuments to our
fallen heroes are not made of marble
Theyre deep in the jungle -- a rifle
driven into the ground a helmet
perched atop it some dog tags

(beat)
And that is the kind of tribute this
man has earned He doesnt get a
twenty-one gun salute or any of the
other honors usually bestowed upon a
soldier He gets more

(beat)
He goes to meet his maker with the
honor he claimed for himself

starts singing the Marine hymn A few others join in

relief -- thats better Hes about to turn away from the
window when

THE THREE HUNDRED MEN turn as one and salute him

Winter grimaces does not return the salute

The men drop their salute and march off toward the Tiers

Bring General Irwin to me

Winter turns and glares at Peretz -- do not fuck with me
Peretz nods and leaves

COLONEL WINTER
If the inmates could confine
themselves to a simple hand motion
such as this
(runs hand through hair)

2 dont see any problem Its —

not technically a salute and as
long as no one outside of the USDB
knows about it we can live with it

All right
GENERAL IRWIN
(beat)
I dont think that really matters
now

COLONEL WINTER
All right I just thought--

GENERAL IRWIN
In fact Colonel theres only one
thing the men want anymore

COLONEL WINTER
And that is

GENERAL IRWIN
Your resignation

COLONEL WINTER
Excuse me

GENERAL IRWIN
They dont want better food They
dont want more TV They dont even
want out They just want you to go
away

Winter looks at Irwin for a moment thinking

COLONEL WINTER
Lieutenant Peretz

GENERAL IRWIN
I agree with them You should go
But not because of the brutality you
encourage Not even because you
have men killed You should go
because you are the very worst kind
of officer Youre a disgrace to
the uniform

Karen Goldberg 96
The door opens Peretz appears

COLONEL WINTER
Escort the prisoner back to his cell

Peretz nods gestures to the door for Irwin Irwin locks
eyes with Winter then walks out Peretz follows him

Winter just sits there for a moment thinking He reaches
over and taps his intercom button

COLONEL WINTER (contd)
Marjorie get General Wheeler on the
line

SECRETARY (V0)
Colonel I’m sure hes left for the
day--

COLONEL WINTER
Then get him at home

Winter sits back looking out at the Yard playing with
something in his hands He looks down and sees that it’s

same old bayonet again Winter looks at it His phone
buzzes Winter drops the bayonet on his desk and picks up
the phone

compassionate release on medical
grounds Ill be honest this was my

Doc As Irwin draws he speaks and it’s a speech weve
heard before

GENERAL IRWIN
The first castles were the walled
cities of Mesopotamia built over
8000 years ago Castles havent
changed much down the centuries
There have always been walls and
gates and men to guard them Castle
walls have always held high ground
positions to fire from and places to
run a flag The only difference
between this castle and the countless
others built over the last 8000
years is that they were built to
keep people out This castle was
built to keep people in But it’s
still a castle And the secret to
taking it is gaining control of the
one thing battle-planners have always
wanted to control

manage to “take the high ground” and
all that aren’t they just gonna
send in the National Guard

242 EXT THE YARD - DUSK 242
Everyone stands still staring at the pilot-less HELICOPTER
belching smoke making awful clunking sounds sixty feet off
the ground McClintock St Cyr and two others dangle beneath
it

Irwin looks at the end of the CHAIN hanging from the
helicopter laying on the ground The chain is going up
into the air one link at a time
GENERAL IRWIN
Its rising
(to McClintock and others)
Get down Now

McClintock and the others start climbing down but the
helicopter is climbing faster than they can descend

Irwin watches the end of the chain lift off the ground swing
back and forth under the rising helicopter Then out of

the corner of his eye he notices

A FIGURE running across the Yard Irwin turns sees

YATES sprinting toward the helicopter

The end of the chain is twelve feet off the ground -- too
high for Yates to grab

So Yates leaps plants one foot on an inmates hip the other
on a guys shoulder and springs up high HIS HANDS grab
onto the end of the chain and he swings

THE HELICOPTER starts to sway back and forth as Yates
pendulums beneath it Yates starts up the chain

THE INMATES hanging on the ropes watch him
THE HELICOPTER slips off level starts sliding to one side
Yates still has twenty feet to go

The helicopter drifts quickly toward the wall

Yates has ten feet to go
The helicopter is fifty feet from the wall and closing
Yates gets to the helicopter skid as
THE BLADE TIPS brush against the wall kicking off sparks
Yates reaches into the helicopter grabs the cyclic pulls
The helicopter comes away from the wall

Yates gets half in banks the chopper back to the center of
the Yard gets it stable

CLUNKICLUNKCLUNK the engine stops The helicopter drops

Yates heaves the pilot out of his seat and then seemingly
against logic pushes the cyclic forward

The helicopter tilts forward sharply and dives at a steep
angle toward the ground

The men hanging from the ropes scream as they sail toward
impact

Irwin and everyone else watching thinks Yates is insane

Then at the last possible moment Yates yanks back on the
cyclic

The helicopter blades auto-rotate spinning fast from the
sudden rapid drop briefly slowing the descent

The men on the ropes let go drop ten feet scramble clear
Yates braces himself as the helicopter free-falls twenty
feet and slams hard to the ground THE WINDOWS explode and
glass flies everywhere
Yates is stunned blood running from cuts to his face HANDS
grab him and pull him out of the helicopter The hands belong
to
McClintock St Cyr and the two other men who had been
dangling beneath the helicopter -- the men whose lives Yates
just saved They hoist Yates up onto their shoulders

Yates looks over sees Irwin They share a look Irwin
nods his approval Yates shakes his head in disbelief

GENERAL IRWIN
Right now I suspect he’s calling
General Wheeler on his cell phone

DELLWO
Cell phone Shit Then why’d we
go to all that trouble taking out

GENERAL IRWIN
To disrupt the communications inside

promoted to captain she saluted me
all the time I’d come out of the
crapper and there she’d be with a
real sharp salute She was very
funny But it wasn’t just a joke
She was really proud of me

(beat)
When the thing happened in Canada
she was pretty pissed Smuggling
the mushrooms didnt bother her that
much -- she just thought that was
stupid It was cooperating with JAG
to get a shorter bit She thought
that was dishonorable And she
was right

negotiations As it happens
however

(crumples up sheet)
there will be no negotiations

Wheeler tosses the balled-up paper Yates starts to
realize

Karen Goldberg

And every man in there who hasnt
been sitting in his cell all day is
going to get another two tacked on
minimum And those will be the lucky
ones

(off Yates’ look)
If you dont do what I ask we will
have to retake this facility by force
Hundreds more men could die

duty at USDB knows the score We

hostages

And while you’re thinking there’s
someone I want you to talk to

grows as the corporal returns escorting a WOMAN into the

YATES

(realizing)
Oh my God Of course You knew
Wheeler wouldn’t negotiate You
knew he’d want to take you out and
you wanted it to go this way instead

me to be the messenger You knew
Wheeler would make me an offer If
youd picked Cyrus
Cyrus wouldve told Wheeler to go
fuck himself But me You knew Id
go along Didn’t you

GENERAL IRWIN

The thought had occurred to me

taken

YATES
Some medical facility at Fort Hood

Karen Goldberg

GENERAL IRWIN

The Fort Hood Army Psychiatric
Hospital Standard operating procedure
for someone like me

(off Yates’ look)
One of our army’s nastier little
secrets If theyve got a
whistleblower or a troublemaker they
don’t want to discharge they send
them to Hood let them pad the halls
in paper shoes doing the thorazine
shuffle

flintlock under the door handle and stabs the barrel tip
into the pebbled tar of the roof Irwin turns to Winter as

Do you know the history of this

facility Of the fort that stood
here before this stockade

Winter gives no response Irwin starts carefully unfolding

the flag his back to Winter

GENERAL IRWIN (contd)
A hundred and fifty years ago one
April Sunday after the snow had
melted it was overrun by a band of
Sioux warriors led by Chief Bright
Eagle The garrison commander
Captain Henry Rice got approval
from the Chief to run the flag
What the Chief didn’t notice was
that Rice ran the flag upside down
When reinforcements arrived -- led
by a young lieutenant named George
Armstrong Custer -- they saw the
inverted flag -- which as you know

True But you see in Custer’s day
there weren’t any TV news crews out
beyond the fence with their astounding
long lens cameras

Irwin nods his head Winter looks HIS POV Beyond Wheeler
and his men there are TV newsvans cameramen standing on
top Irwin turns back to the flag and flagpole

GENERAL IRWIN (contd)
I dont know if they can see you or
me too clearly from there but they
will certainly be able to see the
flag Especially if it’s upside-
down I guarantee you an upside-
down flag at this facility would
make the cover of Time magazine on
Monday morning If it does I can
also guarantee you that by Tuesday
nine am youll be on administrative
leave and never heard from again

Winter points his revolver at Irwin cocks the hammer back

COLONEL WINTER
Let go of the flag

Irwin looks back at Winter and his gun

GENERAL IRWIN

You know normally Id be afraid of
someone pointing a large calibre
pistol at my back But I know you
Colonel You never do your own
killing

(nods at gun)
Put it down before you embarrass
yourself any further

Irwin turns his back on Winter He Snaps the first of two

hooks onto the flag Winter is shaking with rage And it

looks like he might actually pull the trigger Then WHAM

Someone bangs against the inside of the roof door The tip
of the flintlock slips an inch in the roof tar

Winter gun still trained on Irwin moves to the door

Winter kicks the rifle away from the door Peretz steps

Peretz sneers and starts toward Irwin pulling his baton

Suddenly YATES sprints out from the stairs and dives into
Peretz They slam to the roof

Get ready to salute Colonel

Irwin turns back to the flagpole He Snaps the second clip
onto the flag He grabs the line BANG He stumbles
forward

Winter holds his revolver Smoke curls out of the barrel
Theres a spreading red stain on the back of Irwin’s uniform
Irwin has an odd look on his face -- surprise but relief
too and a certain satisfaction
