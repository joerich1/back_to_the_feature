1 INT DERELICT MANSION - NIGHT

We are in a dilapidated old mansion The walls are
pitted and broken paint is flaking and there is a
general atmosphere of dankness and dread

Flash-cuts depict a scene of extreme violence Lots of
SCREAMING and SHOUTING We do not see the participants
clearly A man is attacking a woman punching her

kicking her and finally strangling her

As the assault plays out we see quick disturbing images
of a pair of fiery red eyes surrounded by rough puke-
yellow skin

In the background another man lies on the floor bleeding
heavily from a head wound The woman slumps to the floor
gasping

A shotgun comes into view and we CUT TO BLACK as TWO
SHOTS ring out Over the black screen a guttural
wheezing LAUGH echoes

FADE IN
2 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

JAMES EDGERTON his wife FIONA and their
children JOSH and RACHAEL are having
breakfast They are a typical family The conversation is
light Josh and Rachael are having cereal while Jim and
Fiona are sipping cups of coffee and eating toast

JIM
I got a call from Brian this morning

FIONA
(slightly sarcastic)
That’s nice What did he say

JIM
(ignores his wife’s tone)
He’s got access to a location for
tonight An old derelict mansion
Nice and creepy

JOSH
(waves his hands in the air spookily)
Whoooc00c00

FIONA
Eat your breakfast Josh It’s a bit
short notice don’t you think love
Why tonight anyway If this house is
derelict can’t we go any time

JIM
It’s the only time Brian can get off
work
FIONA
(angrily)

Oh so we have to drop everything to
accommodate Brian now What about the
kids We can’t get a sitter now

JIM
Come on Fee this is a good
location Besides it’s in the area I
grew up in I even snuck in there
once when I was a kid (beat) Rachael
can watch Josh

RACHAEL
(looks up from her dish)
Can’t Got plans

JIM
Well unplan then You’re staying in
with Josh tonight

RACHAEL
Take him with you I seriously have
plans
JOSH
(excited)
Yeah we can all go I’ve got a
torch

3 of 99
8222012

RACHAEL
Like I really want to go ghostbusting
with dad’s loony mates Not Besides
plans remember

JOSH
(sings)
Rachael’s got a boyfriend Rachael’s
got a boyfriend

RACHAEL
Shut it monkey boy

FIONA
Rachael Edgerton Don’t talk to your
brother like that

RACHAEL
But mum

Fiona closes her fingers as though to say ‘shush’ and
Rachael falls silent scowling at her grinning little
brother

JOSH
Can I go dad Please

JIM
You’re too young Josh

RACHAEL
(stands up noisily)
This is so unfair I’m almost
eighteen and you treat me like a kid
(glares at Josh)
Brat

Rachael stomps out of the kitchen swinging her schoolbag
over her shoulder A second later we hear the front door
SLAM

FIONA
(to Jim)
Nicely handled You could have just
as easily asked Brian to adjust his
schedule

4 of 99
8222012

JIM
She’1ll be okay Like she says she’s
almost eighteen

They stare at each other for a long moment Jim’s eyes
pleading

JIM (CONT)
Come on Fee this will be a good
investigation Lucy’s digging up some
juicy history on the place and Mick
will be able to finally update our
website

FIONA
(sighs)
Okay but you owe Rachael big time
Josh hurry up and get off to school

JOSH
(still sulking)
I’m going

JIM
Why don’t you see if Toby wants to
sleep over tonight You can play
video games loudly and annoy your
sister

Josh seems unimpressed

JOSH
(sulking)
Yeah but I want to go with you
(his eyes sparkle pleadingly)
Toby could come too

FIONA
Josh School

Josh finishes his cereal and grabs his stuff He skulks
out SLAMMING the front door almost as loudly as Rachael
had

Jim smiles weakly at Fiona and continues to sip his
coffee

5 of 99
8222012

JIM
I’m sorry Fee I wish I could
reschedule but tonight really is the
only time we can go Brian’s booked
the night off work already It’s a
really creepy old place I mean
when I was in there

Jim pauses reflecting on what happened to him so many
years earlier He gazes wistfully out of the window the
cup steaming in his hands

FIONA
What happened to you Jim You’ve
never mentioned this before

JIM
(takes a deep breath places the cup down
on the table)
Well that house had a long history
of being haunted Me and my mates
decided to check it out I was only
eleven Anyway we got there just
after dark

FLASH CUT

3 EXT DERELICT MANSION —- NIGHT

We are looking at FOUR KIDS one being Jim twenty-
five years younger The others are TWO BOYS anda
GIRL all about the same age

They are standing outside the derelict mansion The
windows are black and the front door is slightly ajar
Some windows are smashed but the glass in several is

intact

YOUNG JIM
Are we going in then

BOY 1
Go on then

GIRL
Go on Jimmy Are you scared

6 of 99
8222012

YOUNG JIM
I’m not going in there on my own

BOY 2
Jimmy’s shitting himself

They all laugh except Jim

YOUNG JIM
Sod you lot You’re the chickens not
me

Jim takes a deep breath and places a foot onto the
doorstep He pauses peering through the crack of the
slightly-open door Seeing nothing he gingerly pushes
the door open and steps inside

4 INT DERELICT MANSION - NIGHT

Young Jim’s eyes dart around the dusty old house
Silvery light filters through the filthy windows casting
dirty shadows all around

From somewhere upstairs a door is heard to CLOSE It
does not slam merely CREAKS and clicks shut Jim is
breathing heavily He is absolutely terrified

Our POV changes We are watching Jim from the top of the
stairs through the eyes of the DEMON its heavy breathing
laboured and wheezy

BOY 1
(OS shouting)
You okay Jimmy Do you want me to
get your mummy

YOUNG JIM
(loudly over his shoulder)
Piss off knobhead Why don’t you
come in here and see how scared you
get

The demon’s breathing quickens as though in anticipation
of more children entering its domain

7 of 99
8222012

BOY 1
Yeah I’ll come in (pause) When my
arsehole heals up

YOUNG JIM
Oh shite to this

Jim turns to leave and the demon realizes its prey is
escaping We follow its POV down the stairs towards Jim
He turns around His eyes widen and his jaw drops What
does he see

FLASH CUT
5 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

FIONA
What did you see

JIM
Nothing I didn’t see anything I
felt something though I felt
something evil I know that sounds
corny And I smelled something
horrible It almost made me sick

He draws breath

JIM (CONT)
Anyway I legged it and I’ve tried to
forget about that house for twenty-
five years Then Brian calls me and
tells me that he’s managed to get us
permission from the council to go
inside the house tonight

FIONA
All right but something had better
happen

JIM

Part of me hopes that it won’t

6 EXT DERELICT MANSION —- NIGHT

Jim and Fiona’s paranormal group have assembled at the
old mansion It is the one that we saw in the opening
scene Jim looks around at the surrounding area
shivering as though cold

The large house sits in several acres of woodland and an
uneven private road runs from the main road some hundred
yards or so distant Low stone steps lead up to the large
front door of the mansion and on either side a pair of
stone dragons patiently guard their domain

The night is cold and dark overcast yet fine The
atmosphere is brooding and the dark windows of the
mansion seem to be looking down on the people gathered
below

As if on cue wispy tendrils of mist float across the
scene from some nearby trees

MICK ROSS the group’s technician is busy setting up
their equipment which consists of motion sensors
electromagnetic field detectors a couple of wireless
cameras that are set into fixed positions a handful of
digital voice recorders and the inevitable camcorders
with night-vision capabilities

BRIAN FLEMING is helping him They are great friends but
completely unalike Mick is outgoing gregarious and a
complete paranormal sceptic Brian is reserved quiet and
a total believer

Brian drops a case The lid springs open and a camera
rolls out onto the path

MICK
(angry)
Brian you clumsy sod

Mick picks up the camera and turns it around in his
hands checking for damage

BRIAN
Sorry Mick Is it okay

9 of 99
8222012

MICK
Do you know how much these cost
(pause) Yeah it looks fine Be more
careful will you

BRIAN
Jesus Mick I said I was sorry

Mick ignores him and they continue their work

As they stomp around the old mansion preparing for the
evening Jim Fiona and LUCY THOMPSON Mick’s girlfriend
are chatting outside their breath visible in the cold
night air

JIM
So Lucy what have you found out
about the place

LUCY

(looking to a clipboard filled with

papers)
Well the last occupants were a pair
of squatters in the 1970s The house
had been empty since before the war
you see After they moved in rumours
started about them It was said that
they performed satanic rituals at the
back of the house probably in the
woods somewhere nearby

JIM

Yeah I remember talk about that when
I was a kid To be honest the
stories about this place and my
childhood experience here are
probably what got me interested in
this stuff to begin with

LUCY
You’ve been in here before Cool
Yeah well the stories are probably
rubbish Nothing was ever found to
back them up Anyway one day he
returned to find her with another
man
(cont)

10 of 99
8222012

LUCY (CONT)
He flew into a jealous rage and
attacked this other fellow while she
tried to explain that he was just a
friend and that nothing was going on

Lucy looks to the group pausing for dramatic effect

LUCY (CONT)

He beat up this guy so badly that he
almost died He then turned on her
and shot her to death Then he shot
the other man He fled the scene but
was never captured She’s said to be
buried on the grounds somewhere but
I think that’s just local folklore

Lucy points away from the mansion and we see beyond a
stone wall the dark shifting silhouettes of ancient
trees in the woodland that surrounds the mansion

LUCY (CONT)
Not long after her funeral his body
was found on the steps here with a
single shotgun wound to the head

FIONA
He killed himself

LUCY
Yep

She puts her finger to her head and imitates a gunshot

LUCY (CONT)
Then the local stories started They
say his wails of anguish can be heard
in the dead of night while she moves
from room to room with a candle Both
of them trapped in the mansion yet
never able to be together

11 of 99
8222012

JIM
I remember they even had a priest in
to bless the house It was quite a
media circus at the time Me and my
mates came here a few years after all
the stories had died down Good
stuff Lucy Well done

Mick and Brian come out of the house and approach the
trio

MICK
(smiling)
All set up
(nods towards Brian)
despite Florence here

BRIAN
Get bent

MICK
If any ghosties want to show their
faces tonight we’ll cop ‘em

JIM
(claps his hands once)
Right Let’s get on then

7 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE —- JOSH’S ROOM - NIGHT
Rachael pokes her head round Josh’s bedroom door Josh
and his friend TOBY are watching a DVD something with

monsters

RACHAEL
Come on creeps get your ‘jamas on

She lingers by the door for a while
JOSH
We’re not getting undressed with you
standing there
TOBY

Unless you really want to see my
knob

12 of 99
8222012
JOSH
I think she’d rather see Rio’s knob

TOBY
Rio Is he a footballer Or does she
just want to play with his balls

Josh and Toby fall about in fits of hysterics
RACHAEL
(tutting with disgust and blushing)
Funny you queer little pervs
Rachael closes the door and we
CUT TO

8 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY —- NIGHT

Rachael shakes her head and smiles lightly She begins to
walk downstairs but stops and sniffs An angry look
crosses her face and she stomps back up again throwing
open Josh’s bedroom door

9 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - JOSH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Josh has his pyjamas on but Toby is standing wearing

only his underpants Toby squeals in surprise at
Rachael’s surprise entrance

JOSH
Rachael
RACHAEL
(shouting)

Which of you two has been in my room

JOSH
What Why would we want to go in your
smelly room

RACHAEL
Toby you went in my room and stole
my perfume didn’t you

13 of 99
8222012

TOBY
(quickly pulling on his pyjama bottoms)
As if

RACHAEL
I can smell perfume on the landing I
know it’s not mum’s It wasn’t there
a minute ago so one of you snuck in
my room sprayed my expensive perfume
and came back here

JOSH
Yeah right Like we want to stink
like a girl all night

RACHAEL
(at Toby)
He might the sick little freak

TOBY
(with sarcasm)
Yeah and I put on a pair of your
frilly knickers too

Josh and Toby start giggling again Rachael is not
amused She slams the door and we

cut TO
10 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

Rachael cannot understand where the perfume smell came
from She ponders for a moment and sniffs the air

RACHAEL
Gone now Weird

11 INT DERELICT MANSION —- MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

The group are in the main room of the house It is a
large empty space with a high ceiling Two doors lead
into other areas of the mansion one to the main hall and
another to a corridor that leads to the cellar door and
further along the kitchens

14 of 99
8222012

All of the group are carrying camcorders with the night-
vision setting switched on It is very dark and we see

the investigation from their cameras’
Brian as he walks behind him

BRIAN
Pack it in dickhead

MICK

POV Mick nudges

(grinning mischievously)

What I didn’t do anything

LUCY
Grow up you two

After a few moments the investigation begins

JIM

Is anybody with us Please give us a

sign of your presence
Nothing happens

MICK
(smiling)
Well that’s a surprise
(looks to the ceiling)
Come on Show yourselves

BRIAN

Stop being a pillock Mick They’1l
come through if they want to You

can’t force this stuff

MICK

On the telly they get knocks and
bangs as soon as they arrive I

wonder why we don’t - ever

LUCY
Give it chance

JIM

Please give us a sign of your
presence We mean you no harm or

disrespect

15 of 99
8222012

Nothing

JIM
Are you one of the squatters that
lived here Did you kill your lover

LUCY
My camera’s just died

Mick flicks on his flashlight and takes a look at Lucy’s
camcorder He removes the battery and replaces it

MICK

(puzzled)
All the batteries were freshly
charged They should have been good
for the night They’re good ones
We’ve used them a ton of times

BRIAN
Could be a sign Mick

MICK
Could be a duff battery Bri

A BEEPING sound comes from the next room The group all
look to one another

MICK
That’s one of the motion detectors in
the corridor

They all head out of the door and into the dark foisty
passage

12 INT DERELICT MANSION —- CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Nothing can be seen A red light flashes on a device ona
box in a corner accompanying the beeping Mick walks
across to it and presses the reset button

MICK

Could have been a mouse or rat that
set off the sensor

16 of 99
8222012

BRIAN
I haven’t seen any signs of rodents
in here
MICK
(sarcastic)

Yeah like you’re the Rentokil guy
all of a sudden

JIM
Knock it off you two Besides the
sensor’s on a box so the mouse would
have had to climb onto it to set off
the alarm

MICK
(sarcastically)
Ooh I’ve never heard of climbing
mice before Look there’s nothing
here Even my EM meter isn’t finding
anything Not that it ever does

He lifts up his EM meter and slowly scans the passageway
He pauses the device pointing at the door that leads to
the cellar Suddenly the needle swings wildly and the
device BEEPS loudly

BRIAN
(laughing)
You were saying
(to the ceiling)
Can you give us another sign please
Can you bang on the walls Once for
yes and twice for no

Almost immediately A FAINT RAPPING is heard Two times
JIM
Er does that mean you don’t want to
talk to us

Two more faint raps

MICK
This ghost is retarded

17 of 99
8222012

His EM meter BEEPS again then shuts down along with his
camcorder We see his camera’s POV flicker to black

MICK
Shit My camera’s gone now

A GUTTURAL LAUGH is heard very faintly The group does
not pick up on it Our POV changes to something watching
Jim The quiet cackling suggests a hint of recognition

We close in quickly on Jim

JIM
Mine too

FIONA
Mine’s still working

BRIAN
Nope mine’s dead too Jesus

FIONA
(sniffs)
Can you smell that It smells like
perfume Jesus it’s come cold
suddenly

MICK
God it smells like shit

They all sniff the air

BRIAN
I can’t smell anything
(grins at Mick)
Not one of your ‘silent-but-
deadlies’ was it

MICK
You wish
(puts hand to mouth)
You really can’t smell it I think
I’m gonna puke

BRIAN
He who smelt it dealt it

18 of 99
8222012

MICK
(gagging)
Oh very mature

Mick suddenly dashes to a corner of the corridor by the
motion sensor and vomits violently His pathetic
retching the only sound in the house

Lucy walks over and gently strokes his back When he is
finished he turns to her a ribbon of thick saliva
hanging from his bottom lip

LUCY
(concerned)
You okay sweetheart

Mick is breathing heavily and he wipes his mouth on his
sleeve

MICK
Yeah I’m okay now That stink’s gone
now
(looks to Brian)
You really didn’t smell it

Brian shakes his head no

LUCY
Me neither

MICK

(groggy)
Well let’s crack on Here give me

your stuff I’ll see if I can get it
working again

They all hand him their cameras except Fiona who looks
a little dizzy all of a sudden

LUCY
You okay Fee

Fiona is suddenly overwhelmed with emotion and begins
sobbing

FIONA

aul Jim to his feet and he stops

20 of 99
8222012

Lucy helps Fiona who is still filled with emotion Jim
begins to come to and walks by himself He looks
confused as though having no memory of what just
occurred

13 INT DERELICT MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Before they can exit through the back door a cacophony
of BANGING and THUMPING begins all around them They
panic and run outside heading across the unkempt
courtyard through a gate and into the rear of the house
the dark woods not far away

14 EXT DERELICT MANSION —- REAR GARDENS - NIGHT

As soon as they leave the house they stop as though
whatever force impelled them to leave suddenly has no
control over them

They stand in a circle panting and breathless

MICK
Alright what the fuck just happened
in there

BRIAN
What do you think happened Mick We
just had a major paranormal event
mate Jim are you okay

JIM
(still shaken)
Yeah thanks Bri That was weird It
was like I was looking through
somebody else’s eyes I knew what I
was saying but couldn’t stop myself

BRIAN
Classic entity possession

MICK
Classic bollocks more like

BRIAN

How do you explain the batteries
dying then and that foul smell

21 of 99
8222012

MICK
For all I know you swapped the
batteries when we were setting up and
then shat your pants

BRIAN
Go fuck yourself Mick You were the
only one that picked up on the rotten
stink so I’d say that whatever is in
there doesn’t like you Can’t say I
friggin’ blame it

MICK
(shouting)
Piss off

They glare at each other seemingly close to coming to
blows

LUCY
Hey
(louder)
HEY Pack it in

Mick and Brian calm down somewhat but continue to eye
each other venomously

LUCY
What’s the matter with you two
You’ re supposed to be mates Brian
would never deliberately switch the
batteries And he certainly wasn’t
upstairs banging the doors

MICK
Yeah okay
(then to Brian)
I’m sorry mate I’m still not
convinced what happened in there was
paranormal though

BRIAN
Well isn’t that what we’re here to
find out

Brian smiles weakly

22 of 99
8222012

FIONA
(concerned)
Are you sure you’re okay Jim

JIM
I’m fine love Whatever happened in
there has gone now I never thought
I’d say this but that place is evil
Pure evil

Jim takes several deep breathes

JIM (CONT)
Okay I suppose we’d better get our
stuff unless you want to leave it
until tomorrow

MICK
Not bloody likely I’m not leaving it
all there to be nicked by some
friggin’ junkie

The group tentatively re-enter the mansion All is quiet
and they begin packing away their equipment Although
they sense nothing we CUT TO POV shots of something
watching them No breathing can be heard

FADE OUT

FADE IN

15 EXT TOWN CENTRE — DAY

Fiona and Rachael are shopping They have just come out
of a clothing store carrying a carrier bag each We
watch in a WIDE-SHOT as they walk across the pedestrian
precinct

We CUT to a CLOSE-UP as they walk

RACHAEL
Mum do ghosts wear perfume

FIONA

(surprised)
Sorry What was that

23 of 99
8222012

They stop by some benches and sit down

RACHAEL
Last night when you and dad were
out I smelled something on the
landing A woman’s perfume

Fiona pauses for a long time as she recalls the perfume
aroma she picked up during the investigation

FIONA
Maybe Josh and Toby were playing a
trick on you Sneaking into your
room spraying your perfume around
while you weren’t looking You know
what boys are like at that age

RACHAEL
That’s what I thought at first but

they said they didn’t do anything
FIONA
(smiling)
There you go then They definitely
did it
RACHAEL
(smiling)
Yeah
(serious)

I mean no I believed them Even
that Toby And when I thought about
it it wasn’t my scent I don’t think
it was yours either (pause) So do
ghosts wear perfume

FIONA
Well it’s been known for people to
smell what are called ‘phantom
odours’ lingering aromas that
shouldn’t be present (pause) But our
house isn’t haunted Rach Believe
me I’d know

24 of 99
8222012

RACHAEL
(smiling)
Yeah you and dad are real-life
ghostbusters

Fiona looks across at a nearby baker’s shop

FIONA
Come on let’s get a pasty I’m
starving

They rise from the bench and cross the precinct
FADE OUT

FADE IN

16 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - JIM’S OFFICE - DAY

Jim Brian Mick and Lucy are in Jim’s office which is
the spare bedroom They are analyzing their video tapes
and digital voice recorders from the investigation

LUCY
Look at this

Everybody piles around the screen in front of which she
is sitting On the monitor is paused camcorder footage
from the investigation

LUCY
This is from Fiona’s camera
Everybody else’s had packed in
remember It’s when Jim wigged out

She presses play on the machine and we watch as Jim’s
outburst is re-enacted in night-vision

LUCY
Did you see it
(Nobody says anything)
Look behind Jim I’11l play it again

Lucy rewinds the tape and presses play again We MOVE IN
on the screen as once again Jim erupts in green-tinted
fury Behind Jim a bulky dark shape can be seen Is it
human Is it a trick of the light

25 of 99
8222012

BRIAN
Woah Now that’s creepy

He laughs nervously

MICK
Could just be a shadow on the wall
behind him

LUCY

No no It’s at the wrong angle
Remember Fiona’s camera was the only
one working If it was Jim’s shadow
from her infra-red light it should
be over here

She points to another part of the screen just as Jims
shadow comes into view

LUCY (CONT)
See The other shape is still there
It actually looks like it moves into
Jim

JIM
Can you enhance that Mick and see
if you can make out what it is

MICK
Sure but I’1l have to do it at home

JIM
Good work Lucy

They return to their analyses and we mark the PASSAGE OF
TIME with DISSOLVES showing the team in different
positions drinking mugs of tea etc

BRIAN
(listening to audio through headphones)
Jim Jim Check this out We’ve got
something on audio

Again the team huddle around as Brian passes the
headphones to Jim He listens and his eyes widen

26 of 99
BRIAN

(smiling)
Cool or what This was recorded when
nobody was in the house The DVR was
left running as we were all standing
outside shitting ourselves You can
hear us running out beforehand The
recorder was in one of the back
upstairs bedrooms

LUCY

(winking and nudging Brian)
Unplug the headphones so we can all
hear it then dummy

Mick looks at Lucy and Brian a darkness in his
suddenly

8222012

eyes

Brian unplugs his headphones from the laptop and inserts

the jack for a pair of external speakers He cli
mouse and we hear the audio recording

Jim’s outburst and the cacophonous banging are c
discernible followed by sounds of FOOTSTEPS as
ran outside

There are a few moments of silence clearly visi
the waveform display of the laptop then light
BREATHING can be heard It appears to approach t
recorder accompanied by light FOOTSTEPS

More footsteps are heard moving away The breat
then replaced by a MOAN almost like the sigh of
disappointed parent

It sounds human yet also not human as though t
of woman man and child had been blended togethe
the sounds of distant bells or pipes

MICK
Jeeeesus Christ I’ve got to get that
on the website The forum members
will go nuts

BRIAN

(smiling at Mick)

JIM
Great work everybody I think that’s

that footage and uploading the audio
to our server Keep in touch
everybody

17 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS and UPSTAIRS HALLS -
DAY

Fiona waves off the team as they leave and closes the
front door Jim is still upstairs listening to the audio
clip over and over again

Fiona stands at the foot of the stairs for a moment
something obviously playing on her mind Then she heads
up the steps (the CAMERA follows her)

She pauses outside the door to the spare room listening
The spooky recording can be heard from within as Jim
replays the audio over and over From another room
muffled rock music can be heard She sniffs and looks
around

FIONA
(to herself)
That perfume again

She crosses the upstairs hallway to a door with a poster
of Marilyn Manson She knocks and opens the door

18 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE —- RACHAEL’S ROOM - DAY

Rachael gets off the bed and crosses to her dresser

picking up a small bottle

RACHAEL

Rachael hands the bottle to Fiona
onto her wrist and sniffs at the s

FIONA

hallucinating Auto-suggestion

Fiona leaves the room closing the door behind her
19 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY

Fiona goes back to the spare room and reaches for the
handle to open the door Before she can Josh pokes his
head out of his bedroom He is still in his pyjamas

JOSH
Oh it’s you Did you find anything
scary the other night

He makes a spooky gesture with his hands waggling his
fingers in the air

There is a long pause before Fiona answers She is
contemplating about what to tell her young son

FIONA
Not really love Just the usual
creepy old house stuff Nothing to
lose any sleep over Speaking of
which why aren’t you dressed It’s
gone two o’clock Toby will be here
soon

JOSH
So

FIONA
So get dressed

Josh pulls a mock-sulky face and disappears back into his

bedroom Fiona turns the handle of the spare room door
and pushes it open

20 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - JIM’S OFFICE - DAY

As Fiona steps inside the recorded sounds suddenly grow
in intensity as though Jim had the volume set to
maximum She calls out to him He clicks the laptop mouse
and the audio cuts out He turns around

Fiona screams For an instant Jim’s eyes flashed bright
red and she thought she saw the slightest hint of a
forked tongue flick out of his mouth

Then he is bounding out of the chair Fiona screams again
and backs into the wall covering her face with her arms

JIM
What’s the matter love Are you
okay

Fiona peers out from behind her sleeves Jim is normal
again She is shaking

FIONA
S-sorry Jim I thought I saw
Never mind
(breathing deeply)
I need a cuppa

She leaves the room and Jim watches her with concern
Behind him the CACKLING can be heard again despite the
audio recording being turned off The mouse pointer can
be seen over the STOP button

21 INT MICK ROSS’S FLAT - DAY

Mick’s flat is small It has one room that comprises of a
living room and kitchen He has a sofa-bed which is
permanently in bed mode He shares a bathroom with the
floor’s other occupant

One side of the room is filled with his computer
equipment The camcorder is hooked into his PC and the
video footage we saw earlier is downloading A cricket
bat a football and an air rifle are beside the computer
desk

31 of 99
8222012

Mick and Lucy are in bed making love There is nothing
romantic about it They are having a quickie The sounds
of a LUSTFUL CLIMAX can be heard before Mick rolls off
his girlfriend breathing heavily

They lie in silence for a few seconds

LUCY
Mick what do you really think
happened in that house

MICK

Bugger all happened Luce We all got
spooked by a creaky old house Mass
hysteria love

LUCY

But you saw the video You heard the
sounds on the DVR You saw what
happened to Jim and there was that
awful smell

MICK

Yep saw and smelled all of it Pity
nobody else picked up on the shitty
stink though Doesn’t make it
supernatural though does it Maybe
I got a quick attack of catarrh

(smiles)
Fiona said she smelled something too
but she said perfume Now I don’t
know about you but I can definitely
tell the difference between shit and
Chanel any day of the week

LUCY
You’re such a wanker you know that

Mick just smiles again and kisses her lightly on the
nose

32 of 99
8222012

LUCY
It’s like Jim said there’s something
evil in that house Maybe the
blessing trapped whatever it was in
there and over the years it’s been
getting more and more angry
eventually transforming into a
demonic entity

MICK
Oh come on Luce There’s about as
much chance of that as

LUCY
As what As all the batteries failing
at once

MICK

Except Fiona’s

LUCY
(victoriously)
Yes Yes Fiona was the only one that
smelled something else Hers was the
only camera that didn’t fail Don’t
you see the connection

MICK
Nope

He reaches out of bed and grabs a packet of cigarettes
lighting one and puffing with satisfaction

LUCY
Mick Do you have to do that now You
know I hate the stink of tobacco

MICK
Sorry munchkin A man’s gotta do
what a man’s gotta do Speaking of
which

He climbs out of bed and pulls on a pair of tracksuit

bottoms He pads out of the flat the cigarette hanging
loosely from his mouth

33 of 99
8222012

Lucy shakes her head disapprovingly She gets out of bed
and pulls on her underwear quickly along with one of
Mick’s huge T-shirts

She crosses to the computer and sees that the download
and auto-enhancement has completed and is asking if we
want to play the clip She glances around as though
about to perform a covert act and clicks YES

The night-vision footage begins on the computer Mick’s
software has brought out some details in the video and
the shadow behind Jim is much more defined

Lucy gasps at the form It is clearly a human form but
with a demonic goat-like head Small horns project from
both sides of its cranium and there is a faint glint
where the eyes would have been

It drifts towards Jim and appears to morph into his body

LUCY
Holy shit

Suddenly the PC monitor goes blank startling Lucy We
cut to a POV of something watching her from behind
The familiar CACKLE rings out and Lucy whirls around She
tries to scream but cannot

LUCY
(croaking barely audible)
Mick Mick

An invisible force flings Lucy on to the sofa-bed Her
arms wave furiously as if trying to beat off her
attacker but there is nothing there

Something pulls up the T-shirt revealing her flat tummy
and white panties and she tries to pull it back down
her breath coming in short sharp gasps

Her arms jerk to her sides as though being held and her
body convulses We hear the tearing of cloth and she
squeals in pain but something unseen is holding her
mouth closed

34 of 99
8222012

She continues convulsing on the bed looking as though
something is pressing down on her entire body and then
releasing her rhythmically We hear strange cracking
noises as though whatever is on top of her breaks one of
her bones with each thrust

We CLOSE-UP on Lucy’s eyes and they are filled with
sheer raw terror Tears stream down her temples Can she
see what is raping her A low moan escapes her lips and
her eyes roll back

Then all falls still and Lucy emits an anguished guttural
moan She twitches momentarily and then she stops
breathing

A toilet FLUSH is heard and a few seconds later Mick
comes back in He sees Lucy lying on the bed and rushes
across to her

MIC
Luce Luce Oh for fuck’s sake

He grabs the telephone and frantically dials 999

MIC
Yeah er ambulance please

22 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Fiona is sipping tea at the kitchen table She is still
shaken by what she thought she saw earlier Jim is
sitting opposite a genuine look of concern on his face

JIM
What’s the matter Fee

FIONA
Nothing I’m alright

JIM

It’s something to do with the
investigation isn’t it You didn’t
want to go in the first place

FIONA
No it’s not that I think I’m just
tired

35 of 99
8222012

JIM
(not really believing her)
Okay I’1ll be upstairs if you need
me

Fiona suddenly reaches out and grabs his hand He looks
down at her an oddly cold expression on his face

FIONA
Stay here with me for a bit love

JIM
(flatly)
I’ve got work to do I’m only
upstairs

Jim pulls away from Fiona and she seems visibly hurt by
his coldness

Jim heads out of the room leaving Fiona alone She
finishes her tea and leaves the table crossing to the

sink and rinsing out the mug

She jumps as the microwave on the worktop suddenly PINGS
She crosses to it opening the door

It is empty Puzzled she closes the door and gasps when
a pair of red eyes peers back at her from the glass Then
they are gone

FIONA
I’m going bloody crazy Oh sod this

She heads out of the kitchen
23 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALL - DAY
Fiona pulls on her coat and calls up the stairs
FIONA
Jim I’m just nipping out for a bit
Won’t be long
There is no reply She starts to call again but decides

against it and just heads out As the door closes the
phone RINGS

8222012

24 INT MICK’S FLAT - DAY

Mick is on the phone to the Edgertons He is sitting on
the bed sobbing inconsolably Out of the window we see
an ambulance and a police car pull away The telephone
rings several times before the answering machine comes
on

MICK
Jim It’s Mick Look something’s
happened It’s Lucy

(sobs again)
Something’s happened to Luce Pick
up man The ambulance has just taken
her away She’s dead Jim Just dead
Pick up the phone if you’re there

The line goes dead as the answering machine clicks off
automatically Mick slams down the receiver and buries
his head in his hands

MICK
Fuck you then Fuck you and fuck
everybody else

Mick gets up and grabs the cricket bat He then launches
a frenzied attack on the computer equipment smashing it
with the bat When he is finished he drops the bat and
slumps to his knees

We CUT to a POV shot of Mick on his knees the camera
slowly moving towards him Unhealthy rasping breaths can
be heard

DEMON
(hissing rasping barely audible)
Michael I know what you want You
want Lucinda back I can give her to
you

MICK
(whispering sobs)
Fuckin’ hell Now I know I’m friggin’
nuts I’m hearing voices

37 of 99

DEMON
(insane chuckle)
Look around Michael You are no more
crazy than I

Mick slowly turns his head towards the CAMERA His mouth
opens but no sound comes forth

DEMON
Do as I say Michael and you will be
with Lucinda very very soon
Indistinct whispering can be heard as we
FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN

25 EXT PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

We see an ESTABLISHING SHOT of a large modern public
library

26 INT PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

Fiona is sitting at a microfiche machine looking at old
newspaper reports She is reading one about the murder at
the derelict mansion and scribbling notes on a pad at her
side

The report states that Claire Adams was murdered by
her jealous lover Charles Gorman in 1973

The police had found him on the main steps of the
mansion He had shot himself with a shotgun though they
didn’t know from where he had got it

The man that Gorman had attacked was never named and on
his release from hospital had disappeared before the
police spoke to him

FIONA
(quietly to herself)
Well that might explain the
haunting A love triangle ending with
murder

38 of 99
8222012

The article concludes with a passage about the area of
the derelict mansion Fiona reads it aloud quietly

FIONA
This murder is only the latest in the
colourful history of the area The
woodland adjacent to the house has a
long association with paranormal
events including ghostly
apparitions strange lights in the
sky and amongst the trees and
terrifying animal-like beasts that
walked on two legs These stories
date to long before the house was
built and legend has it that the
house was built on the site of an
ancient pagan temple

Suddenly a woman’s hand appears and presses down on
Fiona’s shoulder She jumps and turns around Nobody is
there

She smells the strong perfume again She shivers even
though the library is very warm

She gathers up her notepad and pen pulls on her coat and
rushes from the library

27 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jim comes downstairs and enters the living room He is
walking with a stilted awkward gait and staring directly
ahead not looking it seems at where he is going He
stops by the answering machine

Its light is flashing and he presses the button without
looking replaying Mick’s desperate message JIM has a
far-off look in his eyes as he hits the DELETE button
Then he leaves the house SLAMMING the door behind him

FADE OUT

28 EXT DERELICT MANSION - DAY

The sun is beginning to set but it is still daylight
Brian is standing outside the derelict mansion with a
digital still camera hanging around his neck He is just
staring at its dark foreboding windows

BRIAN
(quietly to himself)
What are you in there

A woman’s hand suddenly grabs his hand and Brian visibly
jumps with shock As he looks down nothing is there

WOMAN
(whispering echoing)
Go Brian Run away

He jumps again as his mobile phone RINGS His hand goes
to his coat pocket He pulls it out and holds it to his
ear

BRIAN
Hello

MICK

(OS)
Brian Thank God I’ve been trying to
find you

BRIAN
What’s up

MICK
(OS)
Something’s happened I need to talk
to you Where are you

MICK
(OS)
Perfect I’1ll be right over Don’t
move a muscle

The line goes dead and Brian frowns as he puts the phone
back into his pocket

WOMAN
(whispering)
Run Brian

Brian looks around and sees nobody He turns slowly
taking in the darkening surroundings looking for anybody
that might be there

BRIAN
(half-heartedly his voice trembling very
slightly)
Hello Is somebody messing with me
because it’s not working I’m not
scared

There is no reply to his query

He shakes his head and steps closer to the mansion He
switches on the camera and takes a few shots of the
outside of the house Then he steps inside

29 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN -— EVENING

Jim Fiona Josh and Rachael are having their early
evening meal Josh’s friend Toby has arrived and the
boys are tucking into fish fingers and chips

Jim’s hands appear grubby and soiled but nobody appears
to notice as he shovels food into his mouth

FIONA
So the area around the house has a
long history of paranormal phenomena
After the library I went to the
parish church and had the rector dig
out some old manuscripts

41 of 99
8222012

JIM
(not looking at Fiona)
What did you do that for

FIONA

It’s called research

(shakes her head)
Anyway he read me an old document
from 1300-something Back then the
whole area was a thick forest except
for where the house now stands There
was a clearing with a spring and an
ancient altar dating back to the
druids

JIM
(winking at Josh and Toby)
Druids eh Were Asterix and Obelix
there too

Rachael and the boys laugh but Fiona is not amused

FIONA
I thought you’d be interested Jim

JIM
(a little sarcastically)
I am Fee Sorry Go on

FIONA
Anyway the old document said that
five hundred years earlier the Devil
had appeared to a young girl called
Alkelda in the clearing She had been
gathering mushrooms and - poof —-
there stands the Devil All fire and
brimstone

JIM
(seeming to grow a little impatient)
You can’t really take these old
parchments at face value

FIONA
That’s not my point The Devil
tempted the girl but she stood up to
him and sent him back to the abyss

42 of 99
8222012

RACHAEL
(smiling wryly)
Were these mushrooms she was
collecting the magic kind mum

FIONA
Very droll Rachael Alkelda sent the
devil packing and the site became a
holy one There was even a convent
there for a while Alkelda who was
an Anglo-Saxon princess by the way
was later killed by Vikings and
became a saint

JOSH
Cool story mum

TOBY
Yeah Mrs Edgerton I think the
Devil’s ace

FIONA

(smiling)
Well keep that between us eh Toby
Anyway the convent disappeared over
time and the spring dried up
Eventually the city spread outwards
and even the forest was pretty much
destroyed But what if that altar
remains under the ground What if
that house is built on top of where
Alkelda sent the Devil back to Hell

JIM
Come on Fiona That’s a bit far-
fetched You make it sound like
Amityville Saints and demons and
mystical altars You should get on to
Dan Brown

He winks at Toby and Josh who grin mischievously

43 of 99
8222012

RACHAEL
As fascinating as this conversation
isn’t I’m going out Bethany and Tim
are picking me up We’re going to the
pictures

Rachael leaves the table and heads out of the kitchen

FIONA
Jim I think this is important
What’s the matter with you today
It’s like you’ve lost all interest

JIM
(seething whisper)
Maybe I have lost all interest Fee
Maybe I’m sick to fucking death of
all this shite

Fiona is shocked and looks to Josh and Toby who are
trying their best not to snigger - as boys do

FIONA
Jim
(she leaves the table and crosses to the
kitchen sink clearly upset)
I think we’1ll talk about this later

Jim grins wickedly at the two boys and mouths ‘We’11l talk
about it later’ mockingly The smiles from Toby and Josh
vanish as they realize something is very wrong

30 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE DOWNSTAIRS and UPSTAIRS HALLS -
EVENING

We follow Rachael up the stairs and into the first floor
hallway She enters her bedroom and leaves the door
slightly ajar Our POV watches through the slim
opening Heavy BREATHING can be heard

As Rachael gets changed slipping off her clothes and
donning fresh attire the breathing becomes a frantic
PANTING

A woman’s LAUGH is heard and our POV whips around

There is the hint of a wispy light form on the landing
but it quickly dissipates

44 of 99
8222012

Rachael bursts out of her room slinging her bag around
her shoulder She stops as though sensing somebody has
been there She goes to the top of the stairs

RACHAEL
(calling down the stairs)
Josh Has your pervy mate been spying
on me again

All we hear in reply is the sound of the boys larking
around downstairs Fiona appears at the foot of the
steps looking up to her daughter

FIONA
Is everything alright love

RACHAEL

(puzzled)
Yeah Yeah I’m fine Never mind I’m
off

Rachael comes downstairs and opens the front door just as
a car pulls up outside and a GIRL of about Rachael’s age
waves

FIONA
Be good love

RACHAEL
(smiling genuinely)
Course I will mum I won’t be too
late Back by eleven Promise

FIONA
Good girl

The front door closes and we follow Fiona to the kitchen
31 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING
Josh and Toby have left the table and retired to the

living room where Josh is now setting up his games

45 of 99

Fiona ignores Jim who is finishing his meal He rises
from the table crosses to the sink rubbing against
Fiona who stiffens noticeably and drops his plate into
the bowl of soapy water

Jim returns to the table and stares into his coffee mug
We hear a faint whispering Jim looks around

JIM
What
FIONA
(turning to Jim)
Hmm

JIM
Did you whisper something just then

FIONA
(exasperated)
I didn’t say anything

JIM
(slightly annoyed)
Are you sure

FIONA
(angry — quietly)
Oh piss off Jim

32 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM —- EVENING
Josh and Toby are playing a fighting game on the

PlayStation They are goofing around and laughing
Suddenly the screen goes blank

JOSH
Oh nice work ball ache You’ve
broke it

TOBY
I didn’t do anything It just went
off

46 of 99
8222012

They look to the blank screen and see a hazy white form
reflecting in the dark glass They shout out loud and
Fiona comes rushing in The ghostly form has faded by
this time

JOSH
It was there mum A ghost Our house
is haunted

TOBY
Cool

FIONA
Now lads The house isn’t haunted

The television comes back on and the boys continue
playing their game as if nothing has happened Fiona
watches them for a few seconds then heads back to the
kitchen

33 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN -— EVENING

Fiona sits down at the kitchen table Jim is finishing
off his mug of coffee

JIM
What was all that about

FIONA
Just the boys spooking themselves

JIM
Well what do you expect when you’re
telling stories about the Devil in
front of them

FIONA
Jim What’s got into you Ever since
the other night you’ve been a right
pillock Nothing I say is right and
you won’t give me the time of day
about anything

Jim glares at her with incredibly angry eyes

47 of 99

JIM
Well maybe I’m sick to fucking death
of all this shit

FIONA
Keep your voice down

JIM
(hissing)
I’1l do as like This is my house
If you don’t like that then fuck the
hell off

Fiona stands up with tears in her eyes

FIONA
Jim something’s wrong with you
You’re scaring me and you’re scaring
the kids

JIM
(deep growling voice)
You don’t know what ‘scared’ is yet

FIONA
(after a lengthy pause)
I’m taking Josh to Lucy’s I’11 drop
off Toby on the way

JIM
(normal voice again)
Lucy’s dead

FIONA

JIM
Call the bitch yourself She’s dead
Fee As dead as that whore who defied
me before

FIONA
(horror on her face)
Oh my God

Fiona hurries from the kitchen We remain focused on
Jim’s face as she collects the boys from the living room
(we can hear her but not see) and bundles them out of
the house A shadow passes over Jim’s face He jumps out
of his seat

JIM
(shouting)
Fiona Get back here witch I’m not
finished with you yet

34 EXT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - EVENING

Fiona gets Josh and Toby into her car and then climbs in

With tears streaming down her face Fiona climbs in and
starts the engine

The car ROARS away from the family home as the sun sets
and darkness descends

36 INT DERELICT MANSION - NIGHT

Brian is still taking photographs with his digital
camera The inside of the house is dark but not pitch
black

The flash from the camera highlights shadows and we get
the occasional glimpse of a dark form Brian seems not to
notice at the time

The glare of car headlights illuminates the room and we
hear the engine stop The headlights remain on bathing
the room in clinical light A door slams and Mick enters
the house carrying his air rifle

BRIAN

Awright mate I thought you weren’t
coming I was just about to get off
What’s with the gun Scared of rats

MICK
Rats Oh yeah Bri This thing’s for
killing rats alright

eye He screams and drops to his knees cupping his

bleeding socket with both hands

MICK
Are you deaf as well as half blind

Brian turns AROUND and we see a dark form rushing towards

him There is a FLASH CUT to the evil red eyes We CUT
back to Mick

53 of 99

He watches as we hear the demon attacking Brian It is
like an animal attack with sounds of ripping cloth and
tearing flesh Brian cannot scream but we hear grunting
and mewling as he succumbs to the dark force

Mick watches and a smile spreads across his face He sees
something OFF SCREEN

He just needs some time alone to
think about things

She closes the door and locks it A throng of people are
entering the cinema and she looks about frantically
searching for Rachael She sees Rachael’s friend
Bethany who is with Tim

FIONA

of a prick Ooh sorry (giggles)

FIONA

BETHANY

Fiona heads back to the car without thanking Rachael’s
friends She unlocks the door and clambers in

the engine and the car sets off

SQUEALING

She starts
the front wheels

The way out of the multiplex is all one-way and Fiona
sighs at the length of time it takes to get back to the

FIONA

frustration

WOMAN
Never mind love You’1ll get over
him

Rachael jumps in her seat We didn’t see anybody sit down
beside her and only a few seconds before the top deck
was empty The WOMAN is very striking dressed in white
with auburn hair

She appears to be in her forties or fifties and has a
gentle smile She has a strange accent northern yet
slightly foreign almost Scandinavian

Rachael smiles back at her

RACHAEL
Is it that obvious

WOMAN
Well we girls have ways of knowing
things don’t we Are you heading

RACHAEL
Yeah Home sweet home At least my
mum will be happy

WOMAN

The woman laughs and Rachael looks at her with
puzzlement

WOMAN

hurt you You’ll be perfectly safe
with me

39 INT DERELICT MANSION - NIGHT

Mick and Lucy are kissing Lucy is dressed in a loose red
dress On the floor lie the tattered and bloody remains
of Brian Mick is in rapture His beloved Lucy has been
returned to him He holds her tightly and they dance in
the glow of his headlights

MICK
I love you so much Luce

LUCY
We love you too Michael We will
always love you

MICK
I never want to lose you again

LUCY
We will be together forever and ever
We will never be parted Michael
Ever

We CUT to a POV from Mick He is kissing Lucy and we
see one side of her face Her eyes are closed but when
one opens it is bright red with a vertical cat-like
PUPIL He screams and pushes back

MICK
Lucy Lucy What’s going on

DEMON
(OS whispering hissing)
You wanted Lucinda back Here she is

LUCY

time

LUCY
You killed Brian for us Michael To

Lucy slips the dress from her shoulders and stands naked
before Mick Her fingers move across her pearl-white
body

LUCY

Be with us Michael We will pleasure
you for eternity Come fuck us
Michael Fuck us now

MICK
(confused)
Luce Why do you keep saying ‘us’ I
don’t understand

DEMON

(OS hissing rasping)
Understanding is not required
Michael Although you have the name
of an angel you have sinned
Michael You have sinned so much

DEMON
Lucinda has sinned also You both
belong to us now

MICK
(screaming)
Who the fuck is ‘us’

Suddenly we are barraged with images flashing across the
screen Scenes of complete depravation Rape torture
murder cannibalism Every obscene horror known to man in
rapid succession

Pus-filled sores burst on clawed hands and evil red eyes
flash at us Screaming and torment are mixed with
cacophonous laughter

LUCY

You are us Michael We are you Come
to me my love

58 of 99
8222012

Lucy extends her arms gesturing for Mick to come to her
At first he resists

MICK
No I’m getting the hell out of here

Mick turns to run out of the building but stops dead in
his tracks when Lucy makes a simple gesture with her
hand Mick turns on the spot his eyes appearing to glaze
over

LUCY
Come to us Michael We need you Be
inside us and we shall be inside you

Mick cannot control himself He walks awkwardly to Lucy
as though being puppeteered by an invisible hand She
embraces him and the demon cackles victoriously

the teenager we can see that the woman is quite tall
approaching six-feet in height

RACHAEL
Thanks for this but I can get home
by myself now It’s not far

WOMAN
I promised to keep you safe child
and I shall (smiles)

The pair begin walking down the street towards the
Edgerton’s house As they pass out of view Fiona’s car
pulls up We CUT TO a SIDE VIEW of Fiona staring out of
the windscreen She sees the bus in the distance

FIONA

Deliberately

Fiona’s car pulls up outside her home She grabs the
steering wheel tightly and takes a deep breath

JOSH
What’s the matter Do you think

FIONA
Course not love Wait here I won’t
be a minute

She gets out of the car and again locks Josh inside
Steeling herself she marches towards the front door of
her house There are no sounds coming from inside her
home

FIONA
(whispers to herself)
God I hope he’s gone out

She turns the handle and the door opens She closes her
eyes for a moment The open door means that Jim is
probably still inside

She enters

42 INT EDGERTON’S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
Fiona can hear the television in the living room and
walks quietly to the door She pushes it open and sees
the back of Jim’s head He is sitting on the sofa facing
the television

Slowly she walks around to face him He is fast asleep
his breathing deep and steady Fiona sighs with relief

She heads back out of the room into the hallway

From the living room we see her mount the stairs taking
each step carefully and quietly

43 INT DERELICT MANSION - NIGHT

Jim is dreaming We see the young Jim standing in the
derelict mansion All is quiet The camera circles him as
he looks around He passes out of view and when he
returns we are looking at the current older Jim

DEMON
(OS whispering rasping)
Welcome James It has been many
years since we first met

There is a FLASH CUT and we see the red eyes surrounded
by rough putrid flesh

JIM
I’m dreaming You’re not real

DEMON
We are real James Your friends know
that we are real See them

A corner of the room becomes illuminated to reveal Mick
and Lucy embracing Both are naked and making love
standing against the wall

Mick appears normal but Lucy’s skin seems to be
shedding Large areas of flesh have fallen away to expose
hideous reptilian scales and pus-filled sores

JIM
(sickened)
Mick Lucy What are you doing

They ignore him and continue their love-making
He steps forward and stops looking down to his feet His
hand goes to his mouth as he sees the bloody remains of
Brian on the floor He staggers back

JIM

I’m dreaming I’ve got to be
dreaming Wake up Jim

61 of 99
DEMON
(OS hissing angry)
You have no comprehension of what we
are James What you call reality is
a mere shadow The realm of dreams is
as solid and vital as your pathetic
understanding of existence

JIM
Who are you What are you doing to my
friends my family

DEMON
(OS hissing)
You know who we are We are doing
what we do James Michael and
Lucinda are with us now Brian was
shall we say incompatible

JIM
Oh my God I did this This is my
fault You were trapped here The
blessing imprisoned you and I somehow
helped you escape

DEMON
(OS hissing furious)
That feeble priest that pathetic
fucking shaman had no power over us
We were free to go where we wished

JIM
You’re lying You were trapped and I
let you out but not when I was a
child You got out in me as I am now

DEMON
(OS hissing)
Think what you will James It
changes nothing Your friends are
with us You are with us and soon
your family will be with us

Fiona turns round to see her husband blocking the

Fiona hurries by Jim and stumbles down the stairs Jim
follows her to the top of the stairs and watches her
leave the house He closes his eyes and when they open
again they are red

JIM

Rachael turns the corner onto her street and sees her
mother’s car outside their house As she watches Fiona

is in the car with her

RACHAEL
Mum

That was my mum Where is she taking
Josh at this time

WOMAN
They’1l be alright I don’t think you

Perhaps if you came home with me

shoulders

47 EXT FOREST CLEARING — EVENING

We find ourselves in a forest clearing Rachael and the
woman are standing observing a YOUNG GIRL dressed in
rough Saxon garments picking mushrooms by an old stone
monument The sun has set and long shadows creep along
the grass

RACHAEL
What’s this How

WOMAN
Shhh Watch

A breeze picks up and the young girl stands up She drops
her basket and mushrooms spill out onto the ground She
looks around scared

We follow her POV as she scans the glade A man
appears in front of her It is Jim He is dressed in
modern clothes totally anachronistic to the setting

RACHAEL
Dad

WOMAN
Quiet child They cannot hear or see
us

RACHAEL

Then why should I be quiet What’s my
dad doing here

His eyes flash red and

She grips a crucifix around

ilently saying a prayer

8222012

JIM
(his voice has become throaty rasping
animalistic)
Do not think weak prayer to your weak
God will save you child We will
feast on your essence Alkelda You
will know pain like no other and we
shall rejoice in your torment

Jim laughs and raises his arms in triumph

Alkelda opens her eyes They are glowing pure white

Suddenly the clearing is bathed in soft silver light
Rachael looks up to see something huge and incandescent
hovering above them

RACHAEL
Bloody hell What the hell is that A
UFO

Jim roars flecks of spit flying from his mouth Alkelda
looks at him her eyes still brilliant white When she
speaks her voice is ringing as though a choir were
saying her words in perfect harmony

YOUNG ALKELDA
This child is innocent The pure have
nothing to fear from you Bother them
no more

Alkelda raises her arms and a beam of energy sears down
from the UFO striking Jim He roars again before
vanishing in a cloud of vapour

The UFO vanishes and darkness descends upon the clearing
Alkelda drops to her knees in prayer

RACHAEL
(to the woman)
That’s you isn’t it You are Saint
Alkelda

ALKELDA
Yes I am Although we tend not to
use the ‘saint’ part these days
That’s just an affectation bestowed
upon us by the Church

67 of 99
8222012

RACHAEL
But you believe so strongly

She points to the young Alkelda
RACHAEL (CONT)
Look at you You’ve just faced down

the Devil I’d have run like hell

ALKELDA

There is more to the universe than
you can know Rachael What you call
religion and science barely scratch
the surface of it all

RACHAEL
Why did the Devil appear in my dad’s
form

ALKELDA

It was a devil not the Devil A type
of incubus actually It appeared as
your father to your eyes I saw
something quite different Remember
perception is subjective

RACHAEL
So what did you see

ALKELDA
I saw the Devil child

RACHAEL
You mean the red guy with horns anda
pitchfork

ALKELDA
Not quite He seemed quite terrible
though Although initially he
appeared quite normal to me

RACHAEL
And the UFO They were aliens right

68 of 99
8222012

ALKELDA

(laughs)

No they weren’t aliens (pause) Then
again perhaps ‘alien’ is as good a

term as any

The woman sighs at Rachael’s quizzical expression

ALKELDA (CONT )
The universe is more vast and
mysterious than you can imagine It’s
more vast than we can imagine There
are forces that are unimaginable
Forces of light and forces of
darkness There are worlds and planes
of existence that even I find hard to
comprehend A balance exists but a
price is always paid to maintain that
balance

She looks at Rachael and there is sadness in her eyes

ALKELDA (CONT )
I need to get you somewhere safe

FLASH CUT

We are back with Rachael and the older Alkelda on the
street outside Rachael’s home

important Come now child

RACHAEL
(mimicking)
‘My innocent life’ I’m not innocent
for Christ’s sake My brother Josh
is innocent

ALKELDA
As in all things there are degrees
of innocence We must go now

RACHAEL
Or what
(she pulls away)
I’m not going anywhere with you

Jim bursts out of the house His eyes are burning red and
when he sees Alkelda they glow a little more brightly

JIM
(growling)
The witch The fucking witch

Jim launches himself at Alkelda She stands stiffly and
closes her eyes Jim’s advance halts suddenly He cannot
move his legs He reaches out with his hands

His fingernails have become dirty cracked and broken as
though he has been digging in the ground for something
Alkelda is just out of reach He spits in her face and
chuckles the forked tongue flicking

Then he winces His eyes shut tight and when they open
they are normal once more

JIM
Rachael Go
(then to ALKELDA)
Get her out of here

RACHAEL
Dad

Alkelda grabs Rachael and they hurry down the street

dark shadows soon swallowing them Jim watches them go
and winces again

Jim has hurt you in any way I’11

FIONA
It’s not Jim mum Well it is but
Oh I don’t know It’s complicated

BRENDA
He’s having an affair isn’t he

Fiona laughs out loud This surprises Brenda who flashes
her a stern look

FIONA
No mum He’s not having an affair
If I told you what was happening you
wouldn’t believe me

BRENDA
It’s that supernatural stuff isn’t

summoned something

FIONA

BRENDA
He’s possessed Like in that film

FIONA
I don’t know mum One minute he’s
perfectly fine then the next he’s
screaming and cursing

BRENDA
(places a hand on Fiona’s)
I know you love Jim and he’s been a
good dad to Josh and Rachael but
I’ve always felt that there was
something not quite right about him

FIONA
Mum don’t

BRENDA
It’s there in his eyes I’ve always
seen it

We FLASH CUT to the evil red eyes and back again

FIONA

Jim is on all fours outside his eyes his hands pressing
against his temples He is struggling to control the evil
within and losing

the road in the direction that Alkelda and Rachael had
gone

51 EXT PARK - NIGHT

Jim lopes into a park area There are trees all around
and large expanses of well-kept lawn grass Beyond the
trees silhouetted against the dark sky we can see the
spire of a church

Jim sniffs the air and cackles He licks his lips and
runs on

Soon he reaches a young couple (JASON and KATHY)
smooching on a park bench He stand in front of them
watching them kissing and cuddling Then they notice him
and stare up at this strange man

Jim licks his lips and there is a hint of a forked
tongue He is almost silhouetted his face mostly in
darkness

JASON
You got a problem mate

JIM
Go on lad give her one
JASON

What I’1l fuckin’ give you one right
in your face if you don’t fuck off

JIM
(to Kathy)
Go on love let him suck your tits

Jim licks his lips again his breathing coming in short
rasping wheezes

KATHY
(shocked)
You friggin’ pervert Jase smash his
head in

Jason stands up and stares at Jim attempting to
intimidate him Jim cackles

73 of 99
8222012

JIM
Go on Jason Fuck her brains out
right here Let us watch as she
comes Go on

Jason balls his fists and takes a step towards Jim Jim
smiles and Jason stops in his tracks

Jason’s eyes seem to glaze over and he turns to his
girlfriend He suddenly grabs her and throws her from the
bench onto the damp grass She screams as he drops on top
of her tearing at her clothes revealing a pair of large
breasts

Kathy tries to struggle and break free but Jason slaps
her hard across the face He rips at her skirt and
fumbles with his jeans Jim smiles malevolently saliva
dripping from his mouth

KATHY
(sobbing)
Jason stop Please stop

Kathy exhales as Jason enters her He grunts with each
thrust and Kathy moans tearfully

JIM
Take her throat Jason

Jason puts his fingers around Kathy’s neck and a look of
sheer panic crosses her face

JIM
(smiling)
Now squeeze Squeeze hard as you fuck
her Jason

Jason continues thrusting his pelvis and his fingers
tighten around Kathy’s throat She gasps and claws at his
hands her fingernails scratching red lines in his skin

Jim cackles and licks his lips watching the dreadful
scene with relish Kathy’s hands reach up to Jason’s
face gouging deep marks on his cheeks He seems not to
notice and continues his assault

74 of 99
8222012

As Jason reaches a grunting climax his fingers tighten
one last time and we hear a horrible crunching sound
Kathy stops scratching at him and her arms flop to her
sides

Jim shudders as though he has also reached orgasm

JIM
Excellent work Jason Your place
with us is reserved (laughs)

Jim runs away into the park leaving us with Jason and
Katy’s ravaged dead body Jason blinks free of Jim’s
influence and looks down at his girlfriend’s limp form

He flings himself off her then crawls back touching her
face gently

JASON
Kath Kathy (screaming) KATHY

We CUT TO Jim running through the park as we hear Jason’s
anguished cries for help cutting through the night air
Jim shakes his head and we see his eyes return to normal
for an instant

53 EXT STREET - NIGHT

Jim is running down a street His breath is coming in
wheezing gasps and he almost stumbles several times He
shakes his head and we FLASH CUT to the red eyes several
times An internal battle for control is going on between
Jim and the demon

JIM
Get out of my head

He turns a corner and sees a church its steeple bathed
in moonlight He staggers towards it and falls against
the heavy wooden doors He rattles the handles but the
doors are locked

JIM
Come on

He BANGS on the doors but there is no reply He turns
and slides down to the cold stone steps sobbing
quietly

DEMON
(OS hissing)
God will not help you James Nor
will the policemen

JIM
What policemen

Just then a police patrol car pulls up on the road
beside the church TWO OFFICERS get out of the car and
head towards Jim Both are male one in his forties with
sergeant’s stripes on his jacket the other is younger

POLICEMAN 1
Everything alright sir It’s a bit
late to be attending church

JIM
(whispers)

Please leave me alone

POLICEMAN 2
What was that sir Are you drunk

76 of 99

The younger officer unhooks his baton and approaches
closer to JIM

POLICEMAN 1
Steady Barry

POLICEMAN 2
Don’t worry sarge he’s just a
pissed up wino

He nudges Jim with the baton

POLICEMAN 2
Come on son on your feet I think
you need a rest back at the station

Jim suddenly grabs the baton He glares at the younger
policeman his eyes burning with demonic fire Before the
shocked officer can react Jim has swung the nightstick
around and smashed it into his mouth

Teeth and blood fly everywhere Jim pulls it back out and
throws it at the sergeant It strikes him in the throat
and he falls to the path clutching his throat Jim gets
up and nonchalantly collects the baton from the damp
ground

As both policemen lie moaning on the ground Jim stands
over them brandishing the baton his eyes still afire
and a hoarse chuckle issuing from deep within his throat

JIM
(deep throaty voice)
Pathetic See James how easy that
was How the flesh is so weak and we
are so strong Now we go and find
your family (pause) After our fun

We CUT TO a shot of Jim from below as though we are in
the policemen’s POV Jim smiles and begins swinging the
baton We hear the sickening squelches of wood striking
flesh and the cracking of bones breaking

Alkelda and Rachael are inside the derelict mansion
There is no sign of Mick Lucy or Brian Rachael sees a
lens cap from a camcorder on the floorboards She picks
it up and turns it over in her hands

RACHAEL
This is the house my dad’s group
investigated

ALKELDA
Your father and his friends have in
their ignorance unleashed a terrible
evil

RACHAEL
Oh come on stop with the ‘olde
worlde’ talk will you You sound
like you’re a thousand years old

Alkelda smiles but says nothing She walks from the room
and into the corridor that leads to the back of the
mansion Rachael follows her Alkelda stands before a
door with cracked flaking paintwork

There is a lamp and some matches on
the table

Rachael feels her way back down the steps and soon finds
the table She fumbles with the matchbox and they spill
out onto the wooden tabletop She finds the oil lamp and
strikes a match

he lamp lights easily despite being very old and
covered with cobwebs A large spider scurries from the
light and Rachael shrieks almost dropping the lamp

She looks around the cellar the light from the lamp

casting dark shadows all around She is petrified and her
hands are shaking so much she has difficulty holding the
lamp

The cellar has a dirt floor and at the centre of the
room it looks like somebody has been digging Rachael
goes to investigate and sees that whoever or whatever was
digging had used their hands or paws

RACHAEL
(to herself)
Jesus I hope there isn’t a mad dog
down here with me Or a mad person
(long pause) Or a fucking zombie Get
a grip Rachael Get a grip

She looks into the hole that has been dug and can see the
top of something made from stone She recognizes it
immediately as the top of the monument shown to her by
Alkelda We have a FLASH CUT to remind us of it

Suddenly it bursts inwards revealing Jim standing there
his eyes once more burning red Both women scream

JIM

Brenda
(then sarcastically)
Mum Thanks for taking care of the
witch for me

BRENDA
Don’t do anything you’ll regret Jim
I’m calling the police

Brenda moves to leave the kitchen but an invisible force
grabs her and slams her against the wall She slides down
to the floor leaving a bloody red trail on the
wallpaper Fiona gasps with shock

JIM
She shouldn’t have done that Fee
(he smiles)
Fee (pause) Fee Fie Foe Fum I smell
the blood of an English - BITCH

FIONA
Jim please Don’t hurt the kids

80 of 99
8222012

JIM
James wouldn’t hurt the kids Fiona
But then again James isn’t here

The forked tongue flicks out of Jim’s mouth

JIM (CONT)
You could say that he’s indisposed

FIONA
No he’s in there Jim you’re in
there (sobs) Tell me you’re in
there

JIM
(mimicking)
‘Tell me you’re in there’ Oh he’s
in here Fiona Wanna see

Jim pulls up his shirt to expose his chest He scratches
across his skin with a cracked dirty fingernail Blood
oozes down his torso

He grabs the flap of skin and pulls it down to reveal his
bloody ribcage Jim laughs Fiona screams at the top of
her lungs

JIM
See He’s right here

FIONA
You bastard Why are you doing this
to us

JIM

James asked the very same question
and I’1ll give you the same answer I
gave him It’s what we do

Fiona looks at Jim’s chest It is whole again with no
sign of the terrible injury he inflicted upon himself

FIONA
Was that an illusion

81 of 99
8222012

JIM
What is illusion but another facet of
reality What is reality but another
form of illusion You humans really
are so blind at times

Josh bursts into the kitchen closely followed by
Brenda’s next door neighbours BILL and ANNE LEWIS

FIONA
Josh get out now

JIM
(smiling)
Too late

Jim looks at Bill and Anne His eyes somehow glow a
darker crimson and the newcomers clasp their hands to
their hearts Blood dribbles from their mouths and they
slump to the floor dead

Josh runs to his mother and she clutches him tightly

JOSH
(crying)
Mum I’m scared

FIONA
Jim don’t you hurt him He’s
innocent

This seems to elicit a reaction from Jim He snarls at
Fiona a guttural growl that chills her to the very core

FIONA
You can’t hurt him can you You
can’t touch an innocent You’re
powerless

JIM
The witch can hide your daughter at
the altar for an eternity but we
will have her and your son We can
wait The whelps might be safe for
now but you are most certainly not

82 of 99
8222012

Jim steps towards her and his eyes glow that deep
scarlet He winces and when his eyes open again they are
normal

JIM
(struggling to speak)
Fiona Josh Go now I can’t fight it
much longer

JOSH
Dad
FIONA
Jim
JIM
(in pain)
GO

Fiona drags Josh out of the back door leaving Jim
battling his literal inner demons

57 EXT FIONA’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Fiona and Josh get into her car and she drives away
quickly

58 INT FIONA’S CAR - NIGHT

Tears are streaming down Fiona’s face and she is driving
erratically Josh is also crying He is terrified not
only of the recent events but also of his mother’s
driving

JOSH
Where are we going mum Where’s
Rachael

FIONA

I don’t know love I don’t Wait
Your dad said that Rachael was at the
altar I think I know where that is

She pulls on the steering wheel and the car SCREECHES

around a corner We CUT to an EXTERIOR SHOT as the car
ROARS into the night

83 of 99
8222012

59 INT FIONA’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jim loses his battle with the demon and a howl from the
depths of the abyss issues from his mouth He runs
through the back door leaving the corpses of three
people behind A police SIREN can be heard getting closer
in the night

60 EXT DERELICT MANSION - NIGHT

Fiona’s car pulls up outside the derelict mansion and she
and Josh clamber out All seems quiet The Moon is high
in the sky now its beams glinting from the uneven roof
tiles

JOSH
Is this the haunted house that you
and dad investigated

FIONA
Yeah Come on

Fiona and Josh enter the house

61 INT FIONA’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A pair of policemen enter Fiona’s mother’s house through
the back door The flashing light from their patrol car
reflects into the house from outside They see the dead
bodies on the floor

One of them (POLICEMAN 3) retches while the other
(POLICEMAN 4) calls for backup

62 INT DERELICT MANSION - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Fiona and Josh walk slowly into the mansion Their
footsteps sound unnaturally loud on the cracked floor

tiles

Moonlight filters in through the broken windows Fiona
pulls a pocket torch out of her coat and flicks it on

JOSH

(frightened)
What are we doing here mum

84 of 99
8222012

FIONA
I’m not sure Josh I think Rachael’s
here somewhere

JOSH
I’m scared

FIONA
(smiling weakly)
Me too love Me too

63 INT DERELICT MANSION - CELLAR - NIGHT
Rachael turns her attention from the altar and looks

around the cellar She sees an old spade hanging on the
wall in a corner of the room

n

he walks across to get it and stops dead in her tracks
as the lamplight illuminates three dead bodies They are
hose of Mick Lucy and Brian

ct

Mick and Lucy are naked and their arms and legs are
wrapped around each other so tightly that it seems like
the sockets have become dislocated

Brian’s body is a bloody mess Rachael’s mouth opens but
she cannot speak She drops the lamp and it THUDS onto
the dirt floor remaining vertical and lit

She grabs the spade and quickly retreats She clambers up
he steps and POUNDS on the door

ct

RACHAEL
(shouting)
There are three dead people down
here
There is no reply She pounds again on the door

64 INT DERELICT MANSION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Fiona and Josh hear the POUNDING on the cellar door and
rush through to the back of the mansion

FIONA
Rachael Is that you

85 of 99
8222012

RACHAEL
(OS through door)
Mum Mum Thank God Can you get me
out of here There’s bodies down
here Mum I’m scared

Fiona tries the door but it is locked There is no key
in the keyhole

FIONA
Josh look round for a key Quickly

As Josh searches for a key Fiona tries the door again
It won’t budge

JOSH
There’s nothing here mum

Fiona gets down on her knees and shines the torch into
the crack between the door and the jamb She sees the
catch for the door but the lock is clearly not visible

FIONA

It’s not locked It just won’t bloody
pen I don’t know how we’re going to
get in there

e)

She stands back up and BANGS on the door angrily

RACHAEL
(OS through door)
Mum Are you okay

FIONA
Yes love we’re fine We can’t open
the door Maybe if I hada
screwdriver I could dismantle the
lock

JOSH
Will this do

Josh is holding out a small penknife Fiona smiles and
quickly takes it from his hand She sets about loosening
the old rusty screws They turn surprisingly easily and
she soon has the door handle off

86 of 99
8222012

Despite the entire door lock being in her hand the door

still refuses to open

FIONA
Oh for Pete’s sake Rachael I’ve
taken the lock apart but it still
won’t open

RACHAEL
(OS through door)
I’ve got a spade here Want me to try
and force it open

Fiona rolls her eyes

FIONA
Why didn’t you say so before Yes
stick the blade in between the door
and the frame and try to lever it
open

Sounds of wood and metal meeting come through the door
Then the blade of the shovel peeks through It twists to
the side and the door springs open with a crack Rachael

rushes out and hugs her mother and brother

RACHAEL
I was so scared mum

FIONA
Me too love Come on we’ve got to
go

RACHAEL

Alkelda used some weird flashy magic
stuff to lock me down there

Fiona is staggered to hear her daughter say that name

FIONA
Alkelda Saint Alkelda The dead
Saint Alkelda You’re kidding

87 of 99
8222012

RACHAEL
I wish I was mum She locked me in
the cellar She showed me dad as a
devil It was horrible She should be
here Where is she

FIONA
I don’t know love Why would she
send you down there What’s in that
cellar

RACHAEL
Apart from three dead bodies Not
much An old stone altar that
somebody’s tried digging up with
their hands Dunno why they didn’t
just use this spade

FIONA
Bodies Whose bodies

RACHAEL
(her eyes filling with tears)
Your friends mum I’m sorry

FIONA

Mick Lucy and Brian Oh no I
didn’t want to believe him I thought
he was lying

RACHAEL
Who

JIM
(growling)
Your daddy princess

Fiona Josh and Rachael turn to see Jim standing in the
doorway Moonlight frames his body and there is a

suggestion of small horns at the sides of his head

FIONA
Jim no

88 of 99
8222012

JIM

(ignoring Fiona)
Mummy and daddy have had a falling
out kids It seems we have different
perspectives on how to be a good
parent Mummy wants all hugs and
kisses and special treats for you to
be good little children Myself I’d
just like to rip your fucking heads
off and piss down your necks

FIONA
Jim please

JIM
Was I talking to you witch I don’t
think I was So please go over there
and be quiet

Fiona is flung from her feet across the corridor She
slams into the wall and drops to the floor We CLOSE UP
on her face to see her eyes are still open and blood is
trickling from her nose and mouth

JIM
Did I say ‘be quiet’ I meant
(shouts) DIE BITCH

JOSH
Mum (pause) Mummy

Josh runs across to his mother and tries to rouse her
She is quite dead though He sobs with anguish Rachael
is stunned into paralysis She has just watched her
father murder her mother in front of her She is still
clutching the spade

JIM
(rasping)
Now princess We have much to
discuss

Jim slowly walks around Rachael his eyes never leaving
her

RACHAEL
Dad please don’t do this Mum

89 of 99
8222012

JIM
Your mummy was a lying sow petal
Lying sows get put down

RACHAEL
(terrified)
Dad

JIM

How long will it take for you to get
it into your fucking thick skull that
your daddy is not home right now If
he was he wouldn’t like the way his
eyes are looking at you right now
Mm-mmm You’re filling out nicely
sweetheart

His eyes roam around her body and the forked tongue
flicks around like that of a snake tasting the air

Rachael sees not her father any longer but a disgusting
creature ogling her with lust in his eyes She raises the
spade over her head

RACHAEL
Motherfucker

She brings the spade down squarely on top of Jim’s head
The blade snaps off and CLATTERS to the floor leaving
Rachael with a long sharp stake

Blood trickles down Jim’s face from a huge wound on the
top of his head His skull is fractured and pieces of
cranium poke out at odd angles He smiles

JIM
(rasping)
That wasn’t nice petal And you just
need punishing so badly

He shuffles towards her The damage to his brain has
affected his coordination but the demon is still in
control of his body Jim is nothing more than a puppet
now

90 of 99
8222012

He lurches forward and Rachael brings up the spade
handle The shattered end plunges into Jim’s chest
piercing a lung He exhales and blood flecks Rachael’s
face

She runs around him and grabs Josh He resists wanting
to remain with Fiona but Rachael pulls him away Josh
runs down the cellar steps Rachael is close behind

Rachael pulls the door closed but the lock is gone and
it won’t stay shut

Jim pulls the stake from his chest and it CLATTERS to the
floorboards

JIM
(rasping)
Ow That hurt munchkin I really
need to spank you for that

He plods over to the cellar door and pulls it open
Rachael falls backwards down the steps banging her head
on the ground at the bottom

65 INT DERELICT MANSION - CELLAR - NIGHT

Josh rushes to Rachael but she is out cold Jim slowly
makes his way down the steps almost falling several
times

JIM
(rasping)
Joshy Boy come play with dad

JOSH
You’re not my dad Rachael wake up
Come on

Rachael stirs and her eyes flicker open She scrambles to
her feet and the kids back away into the cellar

Jim reaches the bottom and picks up the lamp from the
floor Its amber light illuminates his face and we see
that more of the demon is visible now that Jim’s body is
dying

91 of 99
8222012

His eyes are dark crimson with midnight black vertical
slits The tongue continually flicks in and out of his
mouth His teeth appear to have become narrower and more
pointed like those of bat or carnivorous rodent

His skin has begun sloughing to reveal sickly yellow
scales riddled with sores that ooze pus constantly

JIM
(rasping)
Kids kids kids What can you do If
you beat them you get into trouble
If you don’t beat them they walk all
over you Can’t kill them because
well you just can’t Can you

RACHAEL

(groggy)
Dad don’t hurt us Please

JIM
(rasping)
Rach you hit me over the head with a
shovel Now I think I’m due some sort
of reparation (pause) By the way
you know when Alkelda told you that
there were degrees of innocence

RACHAEL
Yeah

JIM
(cackling)
Well you just went a degree over
chickadee Come here

Jim reaches out his hand the fingers twitching and
writhing Rachael feels something pull at her She tries
to resist by digging her heels into the dirt but she is
dragged across the cellar towards Jim

Josh grabs hold of her but he cannot prevent her from
being pulled towards her father

92 of 99
8222012

Inexorably she closes on the twitching fingers until she
feels them wrap around her throat Jim lifts her from the
ground and she kicks and pounds at him screaming all the
while

JOSH
Let go of her Dad You’re killing
her NO

Suddenly the room is bathed with light but not from
above The light is radiating from the shallow pit where
the altar is buried

Alkelda materializes beside the pit her entire body
shimmering white her eyes flashing with heavenly power

ALKELDA
(with the voice of a great host many
speaking as one)
Release the child Release her now
and be gone

JIM
No fucking way witch This sweet
piece of ass is ours

The tongue flickers out lustfully exploring Rachael’s
face

ALKELDA
The child cannot be yours An
innocent can never be yours

Lightning flashes around the room This is a
confrontation between aeons-old forces forces that
shaped the universe and governed its laws

JIM

(angry)
Innocent This skanky bitch I don’t
think so

ALKELDA
Release her

JIM
Fine

93 of 99
8222012

His hand tightens around her throat and with a flick of
the wrist Jim tosses Rachael across the cellar She
lands close to the table with the lamp unmoving Alkelda
looks genuinely shocked Jim’s face is one of vicious
triumph

JIM
(cackling)
Didn’t think I’d do it eh Now for
the brat Oh we’ll enjoy sucking the
marrow from his bones

ALKELDA
You have made a grave error This
child cannot be harmed by you Be
gone

JIM

(rasping)
‘Be gone’ This is the 21° Century
you scabby old hag You say something
like

(affects a ‘street’ affectation)

‘Get out o’ my face mofo’ No

Well I tried

ALKELDA
Your words mean nothing Be gone back
to the Pit Leave this innocent be

JIM
Didn’t we just go through this Look
darling nobody in this day and age
is innocent Have you seen what
they’ve done to their planet It’s a
fucking mess Even their kids are
impure going round murdering old
ladies getting off their tits on
drugs If we didn’t have anywhere
else to go we’d fucking move in I
tell you

ALKELDA
This child is innocent

94 of 99
8222012

JIM
(rasping)
Oh for Christ’s sake It’s like
talking to a brick wall Kid come
here I’1l1 make it quick like your
sister

Josh remains rooted to the spot His eyes fixed on his
father He has a strange serene expression on his face

JOSH
Come to me father

He holds out his arms

JIM
(smiling)
Whatever

Jim lurches towards Josh and the child embraces him As
he does so Josh’s eyes glow brilliantly white gold
silver Jim screams and throws his head back

He tries to squirm away but Josh has an inhuman grip
The forked tongue lashes out violently striking Josh’s
cheek Where a line of blood should have appeared is a
streak of solar light

Lightning flashes all around as Alkelda watches on The
screams and wails from Jim’s mouth sound akin to the Pits
of Hades Above this cacophony can be heard a high-
pitched tone ululating and incessant

66 EXT DERELICT MANSION - NIGHT

Two police cars pull up outside the derelict mansion
Lightning flashes from the windows Four policemen
climb out of the cars and stand open-mouthed as they see
a huge disc-shaped object hovering above the house
brighter than the Moon and charging energy down into the
building

67 INT DERELICT MANSION - CELLAR - NIGHT
Josh continues to embrace his father The demon writhes

and struggles but the child holds on A single tear runs
down his cheek

95 of 99
8222012

JOSH
I love you dad

Josh squeezes his eyes tightly shut A final mighty
pulse of energy almost whites out the screen We CLOSE UP
on Rachael as her eyes flicker open

The brilliance fades and we see Josh standing alone
There is no sign of Jim Alkelda has also disappeared

Rachael scrambles to her feet and gathers Josh in her
arms hugging him tightly She looks to the still form of
Fiona and tears stream down her cheeks

As they leave they accidentally knock the table and the
oil lamp smashes to the ground fire soon spreading to
the table and the timbers that form the walls of the old
cellar

68 EXT DERELICT MANSION - NIGHT

The UFO vanishes and silence descends on the area Dogs
begin BARKING from somewhere beyond the trees

POLICEMAN 5
What the bloody hell just happened

POLICEMAN 6
I don’t know but the report forms
don’t cover it Look

The policeman points towards the front door of the house
as Rachael and Josh walk out calmly Rachael takes
several steps then sinks to the ground The policemen
rush over and scoop her up

POLICEMAN 5
Call an ambulance Quick

We PULL BACK and see more police cars approaching Smoke
begins to plume from the windows of the mansion and a
fiery glow can be seen through the ground floor windows

FADE OUT

96 of 99

FADE IN
69 INT HOSPITAL — PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

Rachael is sitting up in bed staring out of the window
at the swaying trees beyond She smiles wanly

Just then Josh enters and they embrace
RACHAEL

How you doing kiddo I hope you’re
being good for Auntie Julie

JOSH
I’m driving her up the wall You know
me

RACHAEL

I certainly do

JOSH
When are you coming home Rach

RACHAEL

Soon The docs say they need to run a
few more tests Make sure I’m not
mental or anything

JOSH

(grinning)
You’re never getting out of here
then

RACHAEL
Cheeky
(she looks out of the window once more)
Josh do you remember anything at all
about that night

JOSH
No not a thing I’m glad I don’t
Mum and dad died you know

RACHAEL
(whispers)
I know I know Sorry

97 of 99
8222012
Josh grabs her hand and smiles his face an image of pure
serenity

JOSH
Everything will be alright Rachael

Rachael is shocked at first but she recovers quickly and
grabs her brother squeezing him tightly

RACHAEL
I hope so I hope so
