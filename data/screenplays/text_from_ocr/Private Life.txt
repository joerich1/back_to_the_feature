PRIVATE LIFE

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

RACHEL BIEGLER early forties lies half-naked on her side
surrounded by sheets and pillows Her head rests on an arm
as she stares into space thinking Rachel’s underpants are
the kind youd find in a twelve-pack moss green cotton
bikinis with lots of little flowers The elastic waistband
is separating in one spot

MAN (0S)
Are you ready

RACHEL
Uh-huh Yeah

Rachel fluffs up a pillow and plants her face in it

(muffled)
I’m ready

MAN (0S)
Alrightie

Like a sun rising over a mountain RICHARD GRIMES mid-
forties in boxers and a faded T-shirt appears above the
curve of Rachel’s hip He sits up on his knees behind her
and after a considered pause pulls Rachel’s underwear down

RICHARD
Just breathe okay
(a beat)
Are you breathing

RACHEL
(muffled and annoyed)
Yes Go

RICHARD
Okay

Richard lays one hand on her haunch and with the other raises
a SYRINGE with a LARGE NEEDLE He nervously takes aim --

One two three

-- and spears the needle into his wife’s flesh

RACHEL
Owww Fuck Richard
RICHARD RACHEL (CONTD)
What That fucking hurts
RICHARD

I’m sorry I’m sorry
Richard’s hand trembles as he pulls the plunger back to check
for blood There is none so he pushes the plunger down

RICHARD (CONTD)
Almost done Almost done Almost
done Done

Richard pulls out the needle Rachel looks at her hip

RACHEL
I think you hit a nerve

Still holding the syringe Richard uses his teeth to
open a SMALL FOIL ENVELOPE causing him to slur --

RICHARD
Uhm shorry honey I did ekshactly
what the nursh told me to do

He spits out the torn-off strip removes an ALCOHOL PAD and
presses it over the injection site just as TWO RESCUE DOGS
ENO and LAZLO click into the room and hop up on the bed

RACHEL
(pointing)
Wasn’t it supposed to be more like here

RICHARD
Nope Upper outer quadrant

RACHEL
Then why did it hurt like that
Nobody on the message boards said
it’s supposed to hurt like that

RICHARD
I don’t know Rache It’s a bigger
needle Maybe you have a lower
pain threshold than most people I
don’t know I’m not a doctor
Remember

Rachel watches Richard as he climbs off the bed and drops the
used syringe in a PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE that already contains a
dozen others This new larger one lands with a dull CLUNK

RACHEL
Are you mad at me

RICHARD
No I’m not mad I’m just
Whatever I don’t know Tired

Richard picks up something from a nearby bureau and offers
it to Rachel It’s A BAG OF FROZEN PEAS
Husband and wife regard each other for an odd moment then
Rachel takes the peas places them on her aching ass and
Richard leaves

CUT TO BLACK
UNDER BLACK A CARD --
36 HOURS LATER
INT LARGE CLINIC WAITING ROOM - DAY

A big bright modern space with large windows At 715 AM
it’s already packed with (mostly white) women in their late 30s
and early 40s Some are accompanied by husbands Some are
alone There are several Hasidic couples One lesbian couple

Among this crowd are Rachel and Richard

SUPERIMPOSE --
THE RETRIEVAL

Richard does the crossword puzzle while Rachel sits with an
unread magazine on her lap furtively observing her fellow
patients including --

A TENSE WOMAN dressed for work tapping her Blackberry

Rachel’s eyes float down to the woman’s HANDSOME LEATHER
PUMPS with gold buckles then Rachel examines her own
shoes OLD SAUCONYS in dingy yellow

DING The elevator arrives and Rachel watches as a SINGLE
WOMAN steps out wheeling a CRYOGENIC TANK The woman

scans the room for an empty seat There are none so she
just stands there stranded with her tank of frozen sperm

With the SWOOSH of a door a NURSE emerges and everyone
looks up expectantly

NURSE
Rachel

Rachel rises holding her coat scarf and purse in an
awkward heap as the magazine drops to the floor

INT CHANGING ROOM - DAY

A WEDDING BAND WATCH and NECKLACE are placed one at a time
on a Formica surface next to CELLOPHANE WRAPPED HOSPITAL
GARMENTS

WIDER shows Rachel in her underwear and socks as she unscrews
an earring We notice a CHAIN OF PURPLE INJECTION BRUISES
above her panty line as she looks around the sterile room
wondering how she ended up here
INT LOCKER AREA - DAY
Rachel stuffs her parka purse and clothes into a tiny locker

ADMITTING NURSE (PRE-LAP)
These are your consent forms

INT ADMINISTRATIVE AREA - DAY

Richard stands at a desk as an ADMITTING NURSE presents
him with various documents

ADMITTING NURSE
Both partners signatures are required
on the second page This is our
policy regarding embryo storage The
fee schedule is on the back You both
need to initial each paragraph then
sign here

She fastens the documents onto a clipboard and hands it to
him As Richard turns to go --

And this is for you

She disappears behind the desk and reappears with a PLASTIC
BAG containing A SPECIMEN CUP

Instructions are inside
Richard takes the cup and smiles awkwardly

RACHEL (0S)
There you are

Richard turns to see Rachel approaching in a HOSPITAL GOWN
PAPER SHOWER CAP and her locker key dangling from her wrist
She seems anxious

RICHARD
What’s wrong

RACHEL
Nothing It’s fucking freezing in here

Richard puts an arm around her and rubs her shoulders

RICHARD
Shhh Relax Don’t obsess

RACHEL
I’m not obsessing I’m cold

He guides her into --
INT THE GOWNED WAITING AREA - CONTINUOUS
-- and they sit down among several other couples

RICHARD
(handing her the clipboard)
You need to sign these

As Rachel begins examining the papers she mumbles to herself

RACHEL
Oh my god What are we doing Are
we really doing this Are we insane

RICHARD
We’re not insane We’re normal

Richard folds back the papers and points out a signature line

RACHEL
(signing)
This is not normal This is the
opposite of normal I’m not sure
if it’s even ethical Remember
what Marty said “Having a baby is
an immoral act”

RICHARD
Marty’s an idiot

RACHEL
“Overpopulation climate change

Richard notices a nearby couple giving them looks
the rise of neo-fascism --”

RICHARD
Did you take your Valium

RACHEL
Yes Why

NURSE 2 (0S)
Ms Biegler

Rachel turns to see a nurse standing a few feet away Rachel
signals that she’1ll be right there then turns back to Richard

RACHEL
Okay I guess we’re doing this

RICHARD
Don’t be scared okay You’re
gonna do great All we need is one
good egg right
Moved by her husband’s optimism Rachel smiles and nods

RACHEL
You too honey Don’t be scared
You’re gonna do great

Richard smiles feebly and raises his specimen cup Rachel
chortles quietly

I love you

RICHARD
I love you too

They kiss As Richard watches his wife being led off to
surgery we hear the incongruent SOUND of GRUNTING and
MOANING

CUT TO
A NAKED WOMAN ON ALL FOURS with giant fake breasts being
drilled from behind by a STEROID-ENHANCED MAN He
grunts she moans Wider reveals that we are watching
the action on a wall-mounted VIDEO MONITOR in --
INT “COLLECTION” ROOM - DAY
Richard sits with his pants around his ankles and the empty
SPECIMEN CUP in his hand staring at the screen with a look
of profound despair
Unable to bear another moment he aims the remote and presses
STOP but the horror show continues Richard tries another

button but the moaning and grunting just get LOUDER

Desperate he shakes the remote and TWO BATTERIES fall out
rolling across the floor

With his pants still around his ankles Richard stands and
shuffles to the monitor A LARGE SHEET OF SANITARY PAPER is
stuck to his ass and CRINKLES loudly

CLICK he switches off the MONITOR Silence at last Then --

ANESTHESIOLOGIST (PRE-LAP)
My eight year old came to work one day

INT OPERATING ROOM - DAY
The ANESTHESIOLOGIST hovers over the camera
ANESTHESIOLOGIST
to see what I do You know

“Take Your Daughter to Work Day”

REVERSE Rachel is looking up from a surgical table as the
anesthesiologist rambles on injecting her with a sedative
She said it was the most boring job
in the world All I do all day is
put people to sleep

Rachel smiles politely as her eyes drift shut and we --

FADE TO BLACK

UNDER BLACK HUSHED VOICES speaking in a foreign tongue
Hebrew

INT RECOVERY AREA - DAY
WE OPEN OUR EYES TO SEE --
A BLURRY HASIDIC MAN in a dark suit standing next to his

wife’s bed talking to her He wears a hat she wears a wig

ANGLE ON BLEARY-EYED RACHEL --
observing her exotic neighbors as she wakes up

Rachel gets up on her elbows and looks around to find that
all the women in the surrounding beds have been joined by
their husbands or partners She calls to a passing NURSE
RACHEL
(groggy weak)
Excuse me(louder) Ma’am Nurse
The nurse finally hears Rachel and goes to her

Where’s my husband

NURSE
Your birth partner hasn’t joined you

Rachel shakes her head The nurse refers to her paperwork

RACHEL
He’s my husband
NURSE
Excuse me
RACHEL NURSE (CONTD)
My birth partner he’s (mispronouncing as
my husband “Grimes” )
Not that that matters it’s Mr Grimes
just
RACHEL

(correcting “Grimes” )
Grimes Yes Richard Grimes
Rachel notices a flicker of concern on the nurse’s face as
she reads something on the clipboard

NURSE
Youll need to speak to a Doctor
(walking away)
Let me go find someone

RACHEL
Is something wrong

NURSE
It’1ll be just a moment

RACHEL
(mounting panic)
Why can’t you just tell me Hello

The nurse disappears
Fuck

Rachel’s eyes land on her Hasidic neighbors who regard her
with flat stares She smiles but their faces remain
expressionless

FEMALE DOCTOR (0S)
There wasn’t any sperm

Rachel turns to discover a FEMALE DOCTOR at the foot of
her bed

RACHEL
(puzzled)
Excuse me

FEMALE DOCTOR
Your husband didn’t have any sperm

Pause

RACHEL
Wait You mean like he
couldnt do it

FEMALE DOCTOR
No He produced And there was
semen but no sperm
(off Rachel’s bewilderment)
Dr Dordick will have to give you
the details

The doctor leaves and Rachel discovers Richard across the
room looking at her with a defeated smile
LATER --

DR DORDICK (60s) silver-haired and handsome in his scrubs
stands at Rachel’s bed side and speaks to our beleaguered
couple while drawing a diagram of the male reproductive
system on a file folder

DORDICK

Think of it like a soda machine
Either one of you ever work ina
movie theater The seltzer comes
from one place

(pointing with his pen)
The syrup comes from someplace
else Together they make Mountain
Dew or Diet Coke or what have you
But if the pipe gets clogged

(draws an X)
--you don’t get Mountain Dew
You just get seltzer Richard
is probably blocked

RACHEL
Mentally Like psychosomatic

RICHARD
No Not mentally Physically
Like what he’s just been talking
about with the soda machine

RACHEL
Right Sorry

DORDICK
I just got off the phone with a
buddy of mine A urologist Joel
Fisher He’s an expert on this
He’s writing a book about it

Dordick pulls out a XEROXED ARTICLE from New York Magazine
and hands it to Richard The title is Male Menopause

RICHARD
Oh my god That’s so depressing

DORDICK

Don’t be depressed Rich Based on
everything that I told him he’s
confident that you’ve got sperm in
there The trick is getting it out
Now there’s a procedure for it And
Fisher is definitely the man for the
job It’s called

(pronounced “tessy”)
TESE Testicular sperm extraction
Dordick hands Richard an information sheet on the procedure

RICHARD
(under his breath)
Oh my god
DORDICK
It’s not as bad as it sounds
RACHEL
You know he only has one testicle

right
Richard looks at Rachel incredulous
What He needs to know

RICHARD
I realize that
(sighs then to Dordick)
I only have one testicle

DORDICK

I saw the note in your file and I
filled Fisher in He doesn’t
anticipate a problem

(pointing with his pen)
What he’ll do is avoid the vas
deferens and go right to the source
by doing a testicular biopsy

RACHEL
Like for cancer

RICHARD
No Rachel Not cancer I don’t
have cancer I have blocked sperm

RACHEL
Sorry He said biopsy

DORDICK
The thing is if we do TESSE well
have to follow up with ICSE
(pronounced “Icksy”)
Intra-Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection
(handing Richard another sheet)
It’s an additional expense but
there’s no way around it
The good news is Fisher is
available and happens to be in the
city today The bad news is
he’1ll need a check for ten thousand
dollars I know it’s short notice
RICHARD
Not a problem

RACHEL
It’s not

Richard shakes his head Dordick prepares to leave

DORDICK
Take a minute to talk things over
and once you’re ready Ill give
Fisher a call while Moira helps
Richard get suited up and we’ll be
off to the races

INT CLINIC CORRIDER - DAY

Richard and Rachel walk down the hall following MOIRA
Rachel pushes her IV pole

RACHEL
(hushed but intense)
Richard We don’t have ten
thousand dollars

RICHARD
I’m gonna call Charlie

Rachel slows to a halt Richard stops too

RACHEL
We said we weren’t going to tell
anybody

RICHARD

I know But what’re we supposed to
do Rache Eleven of your eggs are
sitting in there waiting to be
inseminated and we don’t have anything
to inseminate them with

Rachel watches with envy as ANOTHER COUPLE finished with
their procedure walk arm-in-arm toward the exit

If I don’t call him we’re screwed
The cycle will be a bust we’1ll
have blown through a big chunk our
baby budget and you’1ll have gone
through all this for nothing

INT FERTILITY CLINIC - HALLWAY - DAY

Richard now wearing a parka over a HOSPITAL GOWN paces
back and forth on the sidewalk talking on his cellphone

Rachel stands in the vestibule watching him through the
glass door After a few moments Richard hangs up and
heads inside looking upbeat

RICHARD

He’s on his way with a check
RACHEL

He is
RICHARD

Yep

They walk to the elevator

RACHEL
Did Cynthia say anything

RICHARD
What No Of course not

RACHEL
She’s so judgmental

RICHARD
No she’s not

The elevator arrives Rachel’s Hasidic neighbors exit and
our couple steps in

RACHEL
Yes she is Richard She was even
weird when we were doing IUIs

RICHARD
Youre being paranoid

The doors close
INT CHARLIE’S BEDROOMBATHROOM - DAY

CYNTHIA (50s) with messy morning hair stares at someone off-
screen with her jaw dropped wide open

CYNTHIA
They’re doing it again

Reverse shows CHARLIE (50s) at the sink as he turns off the
faucet and drags a towel over his wet face

CHARLIE
No This is something totally
different New doctor Very high
tech with egg harvesting and
hatching And something called
“Icksee” Have you seen my pants
Charlie slips past Cynthia enters the adjoining bedroom and
starts sifting through strewn clothes

CYNTHIA
I thought they were done with all
that and they were trying to adopt

CHARLIE
Yeah They are They’re still
doing that But after that thing
with that girl they’re trying a
“by any means necessary” approach
Doing both at once

CYNTHIA
Oh my god They’re like
compulsive gamblers

Charlie finds his pants steps into them

CHARLIE
Anyway it’s really technical and hard
to keep track of But there’s a
problem with Richard’s sperm and he
needs to borrow ten thousand dollars

Charlie zips his pants and exits Cynthia runs after him
into --

THE HALLWAY --

CYNTHIA
You’re not going to give it to him

CHARLIE
Of course I am He’1ll pay me back

Charlie arrives at the STAIRS and heads down Cynthia
follows

CYNTHIA
Charlie if you love Richard and
Rachel do not give them the money
They don’t need money They need
help Giving them money is just
enabling them

Charlie shoots her a skeptical look as he enters --
THE LIVING ROOM
Cynthia is a few steps behind him

CHARLIE
To what

CYNTHIA
To pursue this fantasy of
fertility when it’s pretty clear
that it’s consuming them --
emotionally and economically
They’re strung out Their marriage
is a wreck They’re always
fighting They’re like fertility
junkies

CHARLIE
That’s nuts

CYNTHIA
Honey They’ve been doing this for
years They need to stop They need
to move on They need an intervention

GIRL’S VOICE (0S)
Mom

Cynthia and Charlie turn to see their daughter CHARLOTTE holding A PHONE

CHARLOTTE
Sadie’s on the phone She doesn’t
sound good

Charlotte looks back and forth between her parents neither
of whom responds so she drops the phone on the couch and
leaves Cynthia and Charlie look at each other Then OUT
OF THE RECEIVER a faint voice --

SADIE (ON PHONE)

Mom
CYNTHIA
(picking up)
Hi honey
CHARLIE

I need to get going

He pulls on a sweater Cynthia follows him as he makes his
way to the front door where he grabs his coat and exits

EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS - UPSTATE NY - CONTINUOUS

SADIE BARRETT stands outside a dormitory shivering and
smoking as she talks on her cellphone She’s wearing a thick
oversized sweater and pajama bottoms

CYNTHIA (ON PHONE)
(to Charlie)
I really want you to think about
what you’re doing

SADIE
Mom What’s going on

EXT CONNECTICUT HOME - CONTINUOUS

Cynthia watches from the doorway as Charlie crunches across
the gravel driveway and -- VEEP VEEP -- unlocks their
Mercedes Station Wagon

CYNTHIA
Nothing We’re just Charlie’s
going into the city and --

Before he gets in the car Charlie calls out to Cynthia

CHARLIE

CYNTHIA
(covering the phone)
Charlotte You want salmon

CHARLOTTE (0S)

CYNTHIA
(louder)

EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS

Sadie struggles to hear but she can only make out MUFFLED
SOUNDS Several students trudge by with backpacks INTERCUT

SADIE
Mom

CYNTHIA
(to Charlie)
A bialy An everything bagel And
a quarter pound of Wild Nova
(to Sadie)
Sorry honey Is everything okay

SADIE
Uhh not really

CYNTHIA
What’s wrong

Sadie takes a deep drag on her cigarette

Are you smoking
SADIE
(mouth full of smoke)
No I quit I told you
(exhales away from phone)
I just have a cold And I’m
standing outside and it’s freezing

She drops her cigarette and steps on it

CYNTHIA
Where

SADIE
Tivoli School

CYNTHIA
Right Okay I was just checking
You sound funny

A pause as Sadie summons her courage

SADIE
I need to get out of here

CYNTHIA
For the Holidays

SADIE
No Before the holidays And after
(tense pause)
I need to leave here for a while

CYNTHIA
You just got back there

SADIE
I know I don’t think it was such
a good idea

CYNTHIA
What do you mean It was a great
idea You’ll finally graduate

SADIE
I’m not doing well

CYNTHIA
Are you failing

SADIE
No God mom Emotionally not
academically You are so
achievement oriented
CYNTHIA
Finishing college at 25 isn’t exactly
an achievement Sadie It’s damage
control

Sadie’s eyes well up Cynthia grimaces regretting her
choice of words

I’m sorry I shouldn’t have said that

SADIE
It’s what you think
CYNTHIA
No it’s not I just want you

to find something that you love
doing that gives you a sense of
purpose and meaning to your life

SADIE
I found it Remember

Cynthia tries to think of what Sadie is referring to
Writing

CYNTHIA
Of course Yes And you’re really
good at it honey But if you want to
be a writer-writer a professional
you have to be very driven and
disciplined And if it’s giving you
this much trouble in college what’s
going to happen in the real world when
you need to pay your rent at the same
time

Sadie shakes her head

SADIE
I’m not failing Mom I did a lot of
good work at the beginning of the
semester that I’m really proud of
It’s just I’m a little stuck right
now and I’m not gonna to be ready to
hand in my portfolio in Writing
Workshop which counts for like eighty
percent of our grade But the good
news is my professor really believes
in me and she’s willing to give me an
incomplete which is great because

Sadie trails off

CYNTHIA
Sadie What
Pause

SADIE
Nothing I guess I’m waiting for
you to tell me that in “real life”
there’s no such thing as an
incomplete

CYNTHIA
Honey why don’t you just come
home and we can talk about this in

person
SADIE
I can’t come home mom
CYNTHIA
Why not
SADIE
(hesitant)
Because I want to be in the
city
CYNTHIA
Oh god Sadie how’re you going to
do that
SADIE

Ill work Ill waitress It’s
not gonna cost you a penny I
promise Uncle Richard and Aunt
Rachel said I could stay at their
place whenever I want

CYNTHIA
Honey Richard and Rachel have a lot
on their plate Trust me They’re
not in a position to take care of
anyone but themselves right now

INT RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

The song transports us to --

INT BROOKLYN BROWNSTONE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A GIRL holding a DOC McSTUFFINS’ KARAOKE MICROPHONE

strange interpretive dance

A REVERSE shows Richard and Rachel watching with polite
ambivalence They sit with other MIDDLE-AGED DINNER

The song ends The guests applaud The children beam
CAROLINE the hostess (and mother of the girls) tries
to move things along --

A chorus of “Good night” from the table as a BABY-SITTER
herds the kids off to bed

INT LIVING ROOM - LATER

The remaining guests lounge with wine and dessert We

drift through the room catching bits of conversation

We hear a party-goer DAVID talk about alternate side

parking rules In a corner we find Richard talking to
Caroline’s husband BRAD Rachel is nearby

RICHARD
It’s just party people drinking
themselves sick on the weekends I
can barely walk the dogs at night
I just don’t want to find myself at
fifty sitting at a block association
meeting trying to prevent a new bar
from opening

RACHEL
Honey we’re not going to turn
fifty on East 6th Street

RICHARD
I’m forty-seven

INT DINING ROOMKITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Caroline removes a bottle of wine from the fridge as Rachel
enters carrying dishes We hear voices from the other room

RACHEL
You guys seem great
CAROLINE
Me and Brad We haven’t spoken in
two days

RACHEL
What

CAROLINE
For the last forty-eight hours we have
not uttered a word to each other

Just then Brad enters the kitchen with some dessert plates

That’s how we fight Right honey
No words

Brad looks at Rachel shrugs in agreement deposits dishes
on the counter and leaves

When’s your book coming out

RACHEL
April

CAROLINE
(opening the wine)
That’s exciting I haven’t written
jack-shit since Talia was born

POP The cork comes out and Caroline begins to pour

You have got to try this I’m
obsessed I drank it all summer

RACHEL
No thanks

CAROLINE

RACHEL
No I am I love it It’s just

She hugs Rachel

RACHEL
It’s okay

CAROLINE
No it’s not I’m such a dope
Wow I didn’t know you guys were
back to doing that I thought you
were trying to adopt

RACHEL
No Yeah We are We just figured
while we’re waiting we might as well
give this a shot Ha That’s a good
one right Giving IVF a shot It’s
our first time actually We did lots
of IUIs before but we never brought
out the big guns

CAROLINE
It’ll really increase your chances
though right

RACHEL
Yeah I don’t know Our numbers
aren’t so great

CAROLINE
You should talk to my cousin Erin
She did IVF to get her kids and her
doctors told her she shouldn’t even
bother Her chances were like one
percent or something And she got
pregnant twice In her forties
With only one ovary

Rachel rapt mouths “wow”

I’m sure she’d love to talk to you
about it And her kids are amazing

Caroline pulls a photo of Erin and her two kids off the
fridge and hands it to Rachel

CUT TO

INT OPERATING ROOM - DAY

Rachel her feet in stirrups lies on a table tipped so
her head is lower than her pelvis LAB TECHNICIANS and
NURSES stand at various stations around the room Dordick
in surgical scrubs points to one of the spittle circles

DORDICK

on a stool with wheels and rolls in between Rachel’s legs

Your job is to just relax and

Rachel nods not relaxed at all Dordick holds out his
hand and a nurse supplies him with a SPECULUM

DORDICK (CONTD)
This might feel a little cold
Just relax That’s it
MELLOW GUITAR MUSIC begins to play
Do you like The Eagles

Rachel has no idea what he’s talking about until the
vocals begin

EAGLES
Every night Im lyin in bed
Holdin you close in my dreams

Dordick smiles and raises his eyebrows Rachel politely
smiles back and nods

Dordick holds out a hand and an embryologist gives hima
CATHETER With one eye on Rachel’s cervix and the other on
the ultrasound monitor he speaks softly --

DR DORDICK
Alright Let’s get pregnant shall we

Rachel smiles weakly and watches Dordick mouth the lyrics
as he guides the catheter deep into her body

EAGLES
Oh oh oh oh sweet darlin’

EXT CONCEPTIONS - DAY

Rachel holds the collar of her coat closed as she and Richard
stand on blustery First Avenue searching for a cab

Spotting one Richard raises his arm and a PIECE OF PAPER
he’s holding is snatched from his hand by the wind

RACHEL
Oh my god Richard

Richard chases the paper down the sidewalk awkwardly
crouching as he goes Pedestrians step out of the way and
give him looks Rachel watches with a hand over her mouth

INT CAB - DAY (MOVING)

Richard smooths the paper against his thigh and rubs it
trying to remove the dirt and creases For the first time we
see that it’s a BLACK and WHITE IMAGE of their embryos

The cab hits a large pot hole making a jarring dip and bump

RACHEL
Ugh
(to the driver)
Excuse me Sir

The PAKISTANI CAB DRIVER conversing in Urdu on his headset
doesn’t respond

RICHARD
(quietly to Rachel)
It’s okay

RACHEL
No it’s not I’m trying to
implant

Rachel unbuckles her seat-belt and sticks her head through
the opening in the Plexiglass divider

Sir
Startled the driver yanks out his earbuds

Hi I’m sorry but I just had a
medical procedure Gynecological

The driver looks terrified
So if you would slow down and take
it easy on the bumps I’d

appreciate it

As soon as Rachel retracts her head from the opening the
cabdriver slides the window shut WHACK

Richard spots the WATER BOTTLE filled with used syringes
and tosses it into the hamper

As of now no IVF materials are in
sight

BACK IN THE BATHROOM --

RACHEL

RICHARD (0S)
Do you think we should take down

RACHEL

Richard has wandered into --

THE LIVING ROOM where he stares at something off-screen

RICHARD
I’m just looking at it from Beth’s
perspective We’re used to it
but If you and I sit next to
each other on the couch and Beth
sits across from us

Richard takes a seat in the only chair opposite the couch

It’s like right in her face

RACHEL
(entering with a sponge)
What is
RICHARD

The vagina

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals a SEXUALLY EXPLICIT LITHOGRAPH of a

I think we should at least move it
So it’s not so central

RACHEL
(thinks for a moment then --)
No Uh-uh If our social worker
is so uptight that she would
actually deny us a child because we
have a vagina on our wall well
then just screw everything

Rachel marches back to the kitchen and gets down on all
fours

RACHEL (CONT’D)
I mean just fuck it

(shaking Ajax on the

floor)
I am so sick of these people
judging us and telling us what to
do all the time Between the
doctors and the social workers and
the support groups it’s just like
shut the fuck up already and shove
it up your fucking asses

LATER IN THE LIVING ROOM --

A civilized tableau Rachel and Richard nicely dressed and
flanked by their dogs sit on the couch across from BETH a compact social worker While Rachel pours tea Beth
reviews their file

BETH
Before Kyra went on maternity leave
she walked me through everything so
I’m pretty up-to-date But nothing
can replace talking face-to-face
(receiving her tea)
Mmm thank you

As Beth takes a sip her eyes land on the lithograph and
the VAGINA She seems hypnotized by it Richard gives
Rachel an “I told you so” look

RACHEL
She’s a good friend of ours Not
the woman in the picture The
artist who made it She’s our
friend It was a wedding present

BETH
(back to business)
So it looks like you came to
adoption after some fertility
treatments

Nervous “Uh-huhs and “Yeahs” before an uncomfortable pause

RICHARD
It wasn’t for us Didn’t feel
right

Beth nods sympathetically as she writes something down

RACHEL
Plus Richard only has one testicle so

Richard shoots his wife a look Beth moves things along

BETH
I see that you were matched with a
birthmother last winter Would you
mind telling me a little bit about
that

Richard and Rachel check in with each other Richard nods

RACHEL

Okay Um We’d been officially
waiting for a couple of months and
we weren’t getting any calls which
was totally depressing Kyra told
us about Parent Portraits

Beth nods knowingly

-SO we decided to give it a try
(MORE)
About a week after our page went
up we got a call

INT RACHEL AND RICHARD’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

A RINGING PHONE sits on a desk in their home office Taped
to it is a handmade label BABY PHONEINCOMING CALLS ONLY

Rachel stumbles into the dark room stubbing her toe
en route -- “Oww Fuck”

RACHEL
Hello Yes Uh-huh That’s us

She turns on a lamp With the handset wedged between her
shoulder and ear she pushes aside paperwork to reveal TWO
PAGES of what appears to be a play taped to the desk A
heading reads PHONE SCRIPT

No not at all “We’re happy you
called It’s the perfect time”

Richard in boxers drifts into the room squinting and
scratching his head Rachel looks at him holds up a
finger
Yep New York City Uh-huh
Well it’s got its pros and cons
But we love it
Rachel scrawls on a notepad and shows it to Richard
TIFFANY 19
Richard nods
RACHEL
What about you Uh-huh Oh
wow Birthplace of Bill Clinton
No But we’ve always wanted to
She hastily writes something else for Richard

Little Rock Ark -- 13 Weeks Pregnant

Richard draws a deep breath and sighs as he watches his wife
sink deeper and deeper into the call

RICHARD (VO)
It was like a match made in heaven

CUT TO
A SKYPE SESSION - NIGHT

TIFFANY is on a computer screen having an animated
conversation with Rachel and Richard

The voices are barely audible and the pixillated image is
beautiful and strange like a digital dream
RICHARD (VO)

We talked to her almost every night

for a month
ANOTHER SKYPE SESSION --
Tiffany gets up adjusts her computer then lifts her
sweatshirt to reveal a BIG RED HEART drawn with lipstick on
her barely showing belly

Richard and Rachel smile in awe Tiffany pops her head
back into frame Everybody laughs

RICHARD (VO)
We fell in love with her

INT BUILDING LOBBY - DAY
A key is inserted in a mailbox that says BieglerGrimes
Among the mail is an ENVELOPE decorated with HEART
STICKERS and a PURPLE UNICORN STAMP
RICHARD (VO)

She was so young It was like we

were her parents
Richard opens the envelope and pulls out SEVERAL SONOGRAMS
along with a PHOTO of Tiffany which looks like it was
taken at JC Penny’s
INT RACHEL AND RICHARD’S APARTMENT - DAY

Richard puts the photo and sonograms on the refrigerator
with a MAGNET IN THE SHAPE OF ARKANSAS

her lap and watches the landscape roll past Richard
spots something --

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- A CRACKER BARREL

RICHARD
Thar’ she blows

EXT CRACKER BARREL - CONTINUOUS

Richard turns into the parking lot finds a spot and shuts
off the engine They stare at the restaurant

RICHARD
We’re early You want to go in or
wait here

RACHEL
Go in
(opening the door)
I need to use the bathroom

Richard and Rachel walk toward the restaurant straightening
their clothing which is dressier and more conservative
than usual Richard reaches for Rachel’s hand then
notices something and stops

RACHEL (CONTD)
What

RICHARD
On your neck What is that

Rachel nervously fingers her necklace and we see a TINY
GOLD CROSS

RACHEL
Jewelry

RICHARD
I know that Why are you wearing it

RACHEL
(shrugging)
I like it

RICHARD
You’re Jewish

RACHEL
No I’m not my mother’s Irish
Catholic
RICHARD
Your father’s Solomon Biegler

RACHEL
Okay So I want Tiffany to like
us

RICHARD
By lying to her

RACHEL
I’m not lying It’s just a piece
of jewelry She can interpret it any
way she wants

RICHARD

Rache we don’t have to pretend we’re
something we’re not She knows who we
are She thinks we’re cool She’s
not suddenly expecting Christians to
show up It’s not like we ever said
anything in our Parent Profile about
being religious so we don’t need to
start now

(off Rachel’s look)
What

RACHEL
I updated our page

Richard stares at his wife baffled

It felt stale It needed refreshing
So I updated a few things

RICHARD
You mean like our sudden belief
that Jesus Christ is our savior

RACHEL
Will you stop making me feel shitty
about this Jesus Everyone in
our group does it They say they
go to church on Sunday even if
where they really go is just to
brunch or pilates or whatever
because they know that most of
these girls with unwanted
pregnancies aren’t really Sunday-
brunch-pilates-people because if
they were they wouldn’t be in
this stupid situation in the
first place because they would have
already taken care of it by now by
having had an abortion

(voice catching)
(MORE )

--just like we did nine years
ago when we weren’t ready

Rachel’s breathing is shallow and jittery as she holds
back tears

RICHARD
We weren’t ready Rache We were
in graduate school In enormous
debt We had just met We didn’t
even like each other yet

Rachel lets out a little snort-laugh Richard laughs a
little too They fall silent a moment

RACHEL
Do you ever think that that’s why
now we can’t --

RICHARD
No I don’t Ever

A moment Then Richard holds out a hand Rachel takes
it and they resume walking toward the restaurant

FROM BEHIND as they walk away --

RACHEL

It’s just a piece of jewelry
RICHARD

I know
RACHEL

I think it’s pretty It looks good
with my blouse

RICHARD
Yeah It does

INT CRACKER BARREL - DAY

A WAITRESS arrives at the booth and places MEATLOAF in
front of Richard and ICED TEA in front of Rachel

RICHARD
Mmm That looks great Thank you

WAITRESS
(to Rachel)
Are you sure there’s nothing else I
can get for you

RACHEL
No thank you

As the waitress leaves Richard takes a bite of meatloaf
Rachel takes a sip of her tea looks out the window and sighs

RICHARD
Honey relax okay She’s just
late Have some mashed potatoes

DISSOLVE TO
EXT CRACKER BARREL - DUSK

We PAN across a PURPLE AND LAVENDER SUNSET and arrive at

sitting in the same booth -- hours later

Richard and Rachel still in the same clothes from the
trip examine the flimsy print-outs

RICHARD (VO)
When we got home we realized
there was no name or date on any of
the sonograms

SLOWLY PUSH IN ON the PHOTO OF TIFFANY held up by magnets

RICHARD (VO)
Kyra said sometimes the girls just
want the attention and there
isn’t a baby at all

The photo is plucked off the fridge HOLD on empty space

We still don’t know if she was real
or not

INT RACHEL AND RICHARD’S APARTMENT - PRESENT
Beth looks at the sonograms

BETH

It’s much easier when it involves
money At least that makes some
kind of sense But the emotional
scams

(shaking her head)
After something like that a lot of
people give up -- or they throw
themselves back on the fertility
treadmill It’s a real testament
to your strength as a couple that
you stuck with it and renewed your
commitment to adoption

Rachel and Richard smile stiffly and nod The SOUND OF
THUNDER and HEAVY RAIN carries us to --

INT RACHEL AND RICHARD’S APARTMENT - ANOTHER DAY (RAINING)

Rachel opens a KITCHEN CABINET revealing an array of
FERTILITY MEDICATION She plucks a bottle from the shelf and
pops a pill into her mouth Without swallowing she
retrieves one bottle after another in quick succession
filling her mouth with pills Finally with a big swig of
water she knocks back all the pills in her mouth

From another shelf she removes a GREEN BAG stuffs several
pills into PILL POCKETS and feeds one each to Eno and Lazlo
who circle around her panting

IN THE BEDROOM -- HIGH ANGLE

Rachel sits on her bed surrounded by paper working on a BOUND
MANUSCRIPT filled with copy-editing marks and Post-its She
pauses and lays the manuscript on the bed so we can see the
title page WOMEN’S STUDIES by Rachel Biegler Rachel stares
into space for a moment looking uneasy then begins feeling
her breasts She presses them to see if they are sore They

A JACK-O-LANTERN sits on the ledge along with a GOLDFISH
BOWL FILLED WITH LOLLIPOPS Rachel lingers then takes a

receptionist who smiles back

As Rachel pulls on her coat she discovers that she’s
standing in front of a wall covered in CHEERFUL CARDS and
BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENTS She begins reading the notes of
appreciation and looking at the photos of babies and
beaming children

RECEPTIONIST 1 (0S)

Rachel turns to find one of the receptionists looking at her

with obvious empathy
INT RACHEL AND RICHARD’S APARTMENT - DAY

Rachel showers letting the water pelt her face In the

Rachel SHUTS OFF the water pulls open the curtain and
looks at her husband Richard hands her a towel She
wraps herself in it and sits down on the side of the tub

WIDE -- Rachel and Richard sit among other couples in a
cramped seating area The room is hushed except for the
sound of the TAPPING

INT DORDICK’S INNER OFFICE - DAY
Consulting his notes --

DORDICK
You could give it another go This
was your first IVF Rachel
responded well It only takes one
good egg On the other hand the
two of you have been at it for
quite some time and if money is a
factor -- that combined with
Rachel’s age makes me think
sure you could try again but your
best chance of success is with a
donor egg

Rachel and Richard are stunned

It’s a big leap I know It takes
some getting used to And I don’t
want to diminish the loss of a
genetic link for Rachel but there
are a lot of positives to consider
Rachel would carry the child
Control the pre-natal environment
Give birth breast-feed And of
course there would be Richard’s
genetic contribution

(pause)
It’s a lot to wrap your head
around Give it some time

Dordick takes out a brochure and slides it across the desk

Meanwhile take a look at our

EXT STREET - DAY

The door to Dordick’s office is thrown open and Rachel

hurls herself out Richard follows -- brochure in hand
pulling on his coat -- and tries to catch up
RACHEL

He’s out of his fucking mind There’s
no way in hell I’m doing that

RICHARD
We should at least just think about it

Rachel stops and turns to face him

I’m not saying we would do it
We can just explore the idea
See how we feel Make a list of
all the pros and cons --

RACHEL
Are you serious

RICHARD
(tentative)
We’ve come this far

Rachel flabbergasted stares at her husband
What

RACHEL
We talked about this We swore we
would never do it

RICHARD
No You swore you would never do
it I kept my mouth shut because I
didn’t want to pressure you into
something that you’re going to have
to live with for the rest of your
life

RACHEL
Wait So all this time that I’ve been
going along assuming that we feel the
same way about this you’ve been having
secret fantasies about egg donation

RICHARD
It’s not a secret fantasy

RACHEL
It is to me I didn’t know about it
I thought we decided together as a
couple that we would definitely draw
the line at science fiction

RICHARD
It’s not science fiction Rache It’s
pretty primitive actually They do
it with farm animals all the time

Rachel’s jaw drops

RACHEL
Well I’m not a goat okay

RICHARD
Bad example Sorry

RACHEL
Oh my god You’re really freaking me
out right now You’re so gung-ho

RICHARD
I am not gung-ho I’m pragmatic
If we do another IVF with your eggs
we have what -- a four percent
chance of getting pregnant With a
donor egg wed be going from four
to like sixty-five percent The
gambler in me wants to put my money
on the better odds

Rachel’s eyes widen

RACHEL

Oh my god you’re Guy Woodhouse
RICHARD

What
RACHEL

The husband in Rosemary’s Baby
John Cassavetes That’s you
RICHARD
Yeah Rachel That’s me Standing
by while you’re being raped by a
satanic demon I’m just suggesting
we listen to our doctor and look
into all the options We’re
already signed up for adoption
what’s the big deal

RACHEL
Well for one I’m not putting
someone else’s body parts into my
uterus

A NANNY warily approaches with a double-wide stroller
Unable to pass she gives them looks Richard leads Rachel
a few steps to the side smiling politely

RICHARD
(hushed)
I know it’s more complicated for you

RACHEL
Isn’t it more complicated for you too

RICHARD
Yes of course it is But you heard
him There are lots of positives
(stroking her cheek)
You’d get to carry the baby

Rachel swats his hand away

RACHEL
Oh woop-de-do What does that
make me The bellhop

RICHARD
(weak barely audible)
No

Richard utterly at sea watches his wife walk away until
she whips around and hisses

RACHEL
Well why don’t you just go screw a
younger woman then

RICHARD
What’re you talking about

RACHEL
Oh look There’s one now

She points to a thirty-ish woman walking on the other side
of the street

Go fuck her

RICHARD
I don’t want to fuck her

The woman in question glances over picking up her pace
Rachel marches away again Richard goes after her

Look we’re doing just about
everything we can short of
kidnapping to start a family I
don’t know why this is so off
limits

Rachel staggers to a halt and looks at her husband

RACHEL
Easy for you to say You
(voice catching)
Youll have your genetic
contribution Me Ill just be

A spasm of shallow breaths overtake her

RICHARD
(soft)
What

RACHEL
--e-l1llll left out

Rachel erupts into tears Richard watches her for a
moment then goes to hug her but is met with Rachel’s
wrath as she starts pounding on his chest

Keeping his face out of the line of fire he opens his
coat and manages to wrap Rachel inside even as she
continues to pound Finally exhausted her body goes limp
and she allows herself to be comforted

They stand on the sidewalk -- pressed together under the coat
-- as pedestrians walk around them Leaves fall from the

I’m not gonna make a big deal about it
It’s just an egg It’s one cell

One cell that contains half the
chromosomes of our child-to-be

Rachel laughs and shakes her head

RACHEL
Oh my god you are so in denial
it’s crazy

RICHARD
Dont knock denial It comes in
very handy You should try it
sometime Without it you end up

He holds up his book THE STRUGGLE so Rachel can see the
intense face of the Norwegian author on the cover Rachel
snort-laughs then returns to looking at her screen

He reaches across the table and lays his hand on her forearm

RICHARD
I’m sorry I love you

You’re the one who wanted to do this

Oh do you think I enjoy this

mix with my husband’s sperm so I
can inject it into my uterus so we
can have a baby

Richard notices A COUPLE at a nearby table look over

At least Fiona is a flesh and blood
person we actually know instead of
some random thumbnail photo

(an exhale then--)
Maybe we should just ask her

Rachel raises her arm to flag Fiona Richard yanks it down
clanking the cutlery and water glasses in the process

RICHARD
Are you crazy We can’t ask her

place just thinly veiled
autobiographical crap about their
entitled upbringings

(waiter brings plates)
Mmm Thanks And I wont have to
listen to what a big deal it is
that they’re being published in
some random literary magazine that
no one has ever even heard of
like Tin House or whatever

RACHEL
Wait Tin House

SADIE
Uh-huh

RACHEL

Tin House is a really well-regarded
literary magazine

RICHARD
They published something of yours
right

RACHEL
Once Yeah
(to Sadie)
Everybody at your school is getting
published in Tin House

SADIE
Not everybody I just mean in
general it’s like everyone is so
self-promoting and convinced of their
own artistic promise and I’m like
hey my uncle is an award-winning
theater genius and my aunt is a real-
life playwright and author who gets
her stories published in well-known
periodicals that normal people have
actually heard of like The New
Yorker for instance

(MORE)

And they’re over 40 and still have to
live in a rent stabilized apartment
on Avenue A with like drunks and
graffiti in front So don’t talk to
me about the sacrifices you’re making
to be an artist okay

Rachel and Richard stare at Sadie with stiff smiles

INT RICHARD AND RACHEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sadie wearing an over-sized Pickle Guy t-shirt is looking
at the photos on a wall of bookshelves in the living room

Richard sits on the floor trying to blow up an air mattress
without the aid of a pump

SADIE
Don’t you ever miss it You
guys were so great

Removing his mouth from the valve --

RICHARD
Tell that to the NEA

Richard resumes blowing as Rachel drifts in with sheets
and pillows

RICHARD (CONTD)
Oh I meant to tell you I walked
by our old space on Walker Street
the other day You know what it is
now A Citibank Just try doing
Growtowski in front of an ATM

Rachel laughs Sadie reads from a NEWSPAPER CLIPPING

SADIE

This was the year that a small downtown
theater collective reminded us of the
singular power of theater to astonish
In “Tray” a story set among cafeteria
workers in a suburban high school La
Rata and it’s director Richard Grimes
created a political comedy that deftly
examines the racial and socioeconomic
divide that plague our nation

RICHARD
Who wrote that

SADIE
Jonathan Gilmore The Village
Voice

RICHARD

See That’s how sad we are We’re
from a time when the Village Voice
was considered relevant

LATER IN THE BATHROOM --

As Rachel brushes her teeth she notices Sadie’s TOILETRY
BAG After a quick glance at the door she begins to dig
through the contents “Wet ‘n’ Wild Lip Gloss” Pink
disposable razors Deep Cleaning Pore Strips Rachel
abruptly stops rifling and stares dumbstruck when she comes
across a package of “Plan B” morning-after pills Just then
Sadie walks in startling Rachel who swings around and knocks
the bag to the floor The toiletries spill out and roll
around

RACHEL
(mouth full of toothpaste)
Oh shit Sorry I got it

SADIE
That’s okay I can do it

Rachel frantically shoves the toiletries into the bag spits
out her toothpaste and rushes out leaving Sadie bewildered

LATER --

Rachel and Richard lie in bed flanked by their dogs Richard
is asleep but not Rachel

RACHEL
(whispering)
Honey Honey are you awake

No response She softly pokes his shoulder

Richard

RICHARD
Huh What

RACHEL
Do you think we should do it

RICHARD
Do what

RACHEL
Ask Sadie

She heaves a big sigh and stares up at the ceiling
She’s so young
Richard looks blearily at his worried wife

RICHARD
That’s the point isn’t it

EXT EAST VILLAGE - DAY

A SERIES of SHOTS Rooftops in the early morning On the
last one we tilt down to find Sadie smoking on a fire escape
with bare legs unlaced sneakers and a big down jacket

INT KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Rachel is at the counter grinding coffee beans and making
cappuccinos on their semi-professional machine As espresso
oozes she looks out the window at Sadie on the fire escape

Rachel studies her then turns to Richard already sitting at
the table with his own coffee They look at each other then
Richard nods She turns back to the window knocks on it and
holds up A MUG printed with the word “Yaddo”

Sadie smiles stubs out her cigarette and climbs back into
the kitchen to find her cappuccino sitting on the table
along with toast jam and a newspaper

SADIE
Wow How Instagrammable Thank you
(tasting her coffee)
Mmm Yum

Rachel picks up her own mug as does Richard and there’s a
long pause as everyone sips silently Then --

SADIE (CONT’D)
Oh my god Look at us We’re
like an ad for assholes
Sadie laughs and wipes her mouth with the back of her

hand

Rachel and Richard smile vaguely

RICHARD
You mean we’re assholes Or we’re
part of an ad that’s targeted to
assholes

SADIE
No It’s just you know That
whole--

(sing-songy pizzicato delivery)
People With cappuccinos In
their lofts With their laptops
and their dogs With messy hair

(regular voice)

That whole fantasy It’s not
your fault You guys are authentic
and real You’ve just been co-
opted by the cultural mechanisms
that create desirability

Richard and Rachel smile and nod vaguely

Another pause as everyone sips
and he takes his cue

glance

Richard hesitates then gets the ball rolling so to speak

Taken aback Sadie looks at her uncle then Rachel then

I took a Media and Consumer
Society course It was pretty
life-altering

RICHARD
Uh Sadie --
(clears his throat)
-- there’s something that we
want to um

You know I only have one
testicle right

back to Richard

SADIE
Uh yeah actually I do

RACHEL
You do

SADIE
Charlie mentioned it once

RICHARD
He did

Then Rachel throws Richard a
SADIE
Not to me personally But to my
mom I overheard it A couple of
Thanksgivings ago I can’t remember
Whenever you guys were going through
all that fertility stuff

RACHEL
We’re still going through all that
fertility stuff

SADIE
I thought my mom said you guys were
trying to adopt

RICHARD
Yeah We are But recently we
decided that it might be a good
idea to try everything all at once
because Well we’re not getting
any younger

RACHEL
That’s for sure

Rachel and Richard laugh lamely Sadie smiles not sure why

RICHARD
And we just had a failed IVF

SADIE
Wait What Oh my god You
guys I’m so sorry

RACHEL
Thanks

SADIE
That must suck

Rachel and Richard smile sadly

It’s not over is it I mean
youre going to keep trying
right

RICHARD
(a quick glance at Rachel)
Well now the doctor is suggesting
a different approach altogether
SO

SADIE
Oh my god My mom said that you
guys had a lot going on but I had
no idea

(MORE )

This is a really bad time for me to
be crashing here isn’t it

RICHARD

Not at all It’s great
SADIE

Really Because I have friends in

Bushwick

RICHARD RACHEL
No way No We’re really glad you’re
here

SADIE

You’re sure

RACHEL
Yeah

Rachel reaches for Sadie’s hand and squeezes it

SADIE

Me too
(choking up)
I love you guys

Sadie puts down her coffee and reaches for Richard’s hand
so all three of them are holding hands An awkward pause
Then --

RACHEL
I’m gonna pop in some more toast

RICHARD
Good idea

Rachel lets go and pulls a loaf of bread out of the fridge
Sadie spots the Magazine Section and pulls it out of the pile

SADIE
OQoooo
(turning to the last page)
Does anybody mind if I get
started on the crossword

As Sadie finds a pen and pulls the cap off with her teeth
Rachel catches Richard’s eye He nods and composes himself

RICHARD
Actually we wanted to ask you
about your eggs

SADIE
Scrambled is good But however
you guys do them is fine with me
Richard and Rachel stare at an oblivious Sadie who chomps
on toast as she fills in a word

INT PICKLE GUY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Richard along with Eno and Lazlo escort Sadie down an
industrial hallway They arrive at the PICKLE GUY OFFICES
just as the door opens Sam is preparing to roll out a
dolly stacked with BOXES OF PICKLES and BALES OF HAY

RICHARD
Oh hey

SAM
Hey
(suddenly self-conscious)
Or did you mean “hay”
(gesturing to the bales)
With an A

RICHARD
No Just “hey” as in hello
Sam this is my niece Sadie
Sadie Sam

They exchange hellos
Sadie is going to help out around
here for a while I thought you

could show her the ropes

Sam finds Sadie very attractive but maintains his
composure

SAM
Yeah Okay Cool

EXT PICKLE GUY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Sadie kneels inside the back of a VAN as Sam hands her boxes

SAM
I like to be as prepared as
possible the night before The
Farmers Market because we set up
at 500 am And at that hour I’m
utterly impaired and not ina
position to make any kind of
business decision I am definitely
not a morning person What about
you

SADIE
What

SAM
Are you a morning person

SADIE
I guess so I like the morning
The before-ness of it all It
feels optimistic Fresh Optimism
doesn’t come that naturally to me
so I need to grab whatever positive
free vibes I can get

Sadie laughs at herself Sam just stares at her
entranced After several seconds Sadie gestures for a
box Sam snaps out of it and hands her one As she
slides the box deeper into the van he can’t help but
notice Sadie’s thong underwear peeking out over the top of
her jeans Sadie turns back for another box and catches
Sam looking

Oh my god I’m totally whale-
tailing aren’t I Sorry

Sam continues to stare as she good-naturedly hitches up
her pants

EXT STREET CORNER FOOD TRUCK - NIGHT

Richard emerges with BAGS OF TAKE-OUT and joins Rachel Sadie
and the dogs out front They begin walking when Sadie looks
up at something and then stops

SADIE
Oh my god What does that even
mean

THEIR POV -- A GIANT SIGN on top of a building advertising
new high-rise apartments It says LIVE LIKE A ROCKEFELLER
PARTY LIKE A ROCK STAR
SADIE (CONTD)
It’s like an open invitation to
assholes
Sadie snaps a picture with her cellphone
INT RACHEL AND RICHARD’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Rachel Richard and Sadie eat with chopsticks
SADIE
Oh my god my esophagus is on

fucking fire I love this

Rachel and Richard smile and nod in agreement Then
Richard gets down to business

RICHARD
Sadie Rachel and I have been
looking for an egg donor Do you
know what that is

Sadie looks up from her food a little thrown

SADIE
Uh yeah I do They advertise at
school I know somebody who did
it actually A film major They
paid her like ten thousand dollars
That’s how she financed her senior
thesis It was the entire budget
of her short film She called her
company “Ovum Productions”

Sadie lets out small propulsive laugh then regrets it

It was funny at the time not so
much now

RICHARD RACHEL
No It is Yeah It’s funny

Pause
RICHARD
We wanted to ask you about your

eggs actually

RACHEL
In your ovaries

SADIE
(tentative)
Oh Okay What about them

Richard looks at Rachel then back to Sadie

RICHARD
Uh Well We were wondering if
you might consider donating some
RACHEL
To us
RICHARD
Just like your friend
RACHEL

Except not
Pause

RICHARD
Yeah Right Because you know
us so it would be different

SADIE
(softly to herself)

Wow
RICHARD

Yeah
SADIE

What does it involve exactly
RACHEL

Well Technically youd be going

through pretty much what I just
went through with IVF Minus the
transfer

SADIE
What’s the transfer

RICHARD
It’s when they put the fertilized
eggs back into your uterus

RACHEL
My Uterus In this case

RICHARD
Right Yeah It wouldn’t be yours
because it would be Rachel’s
so your uterus wouldn’t be
involved in this instance Youd
be done right after the retrieval

RACHEL
Youd have to be screened by the
clinic first

RICHARD
Theyd give you a bunch of blood
tests A psychiatric evaluation

SADIE
(nervous laugh)
Uh-oh
RACHEL

No it’s not like that They just
want to make sure you’re able to
handle the whole thing
Psychologically
SADIE
Right so I don’t go all --
(widening her eyes)
-- Mary Beth Whitehead on you

Sadie wiggles her fingers and does a crazy laugh then
immediately regrets it

RACHEL
Who

SADIE
Uh nothing Forget it

RICHARD
Who is that again

SADIE
Just something we read about in a
Medical Ethics class
(off their puzzled look)
The surrogate in the Baby M case
In the eighties

RICHARD
She refused to give up the baby or
something right

SADIE
Yeah Sorry Creepy reference
Totally inappropriate

RICHARD
Okay So What else
RACHEL
The drugs
RICHARD

Right of course The stimulating
hormones How could I forget You
give yourself injections to increase
your egg count for the cycle

RACHEL
It’s a lot of shots

Rachel lifts up her shirt exposing her fading bruises

SADIE
Oh my god

RACHEL
It looks a lot worse than it is
But the drugs can make you feel
pretty crazy mood-wise

(MORE )

My shrink had a funny name for it
(to Richard)
What did she call it again

RICHARD
Emotionally incontinent

SADIE
(laughing)
Oh my god Gross

RICHARD

But because it’s not you who’s
trying to have the baby --

(nervous glance to Rachel)
-- directly It’1ll be way less
fraught Emotionally

(to Rachel)
Don’t you think

RACHEL
Definitely

RICHARD
And of course we’d pay you

SADIE
What No way I’m not taking
money from you guys

RICHARD
No We insist We want to pay you
exactly what you’d get if you did
it at any of the university
clinics Eight thousand dollars
just like your friend It’s not a
lot of money considering but it’s
the standard rate and it’s all we
can afford

A pause as Sadie sits there thinking
RACHEL
You don’t have to tell us anything
now

Richard pulls out the donor brochure gives it to Sadie

RICHARD
It’s just an overview

Sadie stares at the women on the brochure’s cover then
opens it

It’s a lot to absorb Take your
time and think it over

Sadie reads a bit then closes the brochure

SADIE
Okay

RICHARD
Good
(rubbing his hands
together)
All right who needs more beer

RACHEL
(raising her hand)
I do

SADIE
No I mean okay Yes I’11 do it
(off their confused look)
The egg thing I’11 do it

RICHARD RACHEL
Oh no You don’t have to You really need to take some
give us an answer now time to think about it It’s

a big decision

SADIE
Why I’m totally cool with it

Rachel and Richard are clearly freaked out by the speed
of Sadie’s decision

Really It’s not like I’m doing
anything else right now I don’t
even have a job And what could be
more rewarding than helping two
people I love start a family

(voice breaking)
You guys have always been such role
models for me You’re so supportive
and non-judgmental You’re going to
be such amazing parents Way better
than mine

RACHEL
That’s not true You have great
parents

Sadie rolls her eyes

RICHARD
We’ll need to talk to them about
it too you know It has to all
be out in the open Totally
transparent

SADIE
I don’t see a problem with that

RACHEL
You don’t

SADIE
Nah My mom is all about me
finding a purpose and doing
something “real” with my life
Sadie picks up the brochure and waves it around

Welp It doesn’t get more real
than this right

INT DINING ROOM - LATER

The table is crowded with family and friends Charlie clinks his
glass with a knife Everyone quiets as Cynthia stands

CYNTHIA
Charlie and I decided that we
wanted to do Thanksgiving right for
a change So before we dig in wed
like to go around the table and
invite everyone to talk about what
they are thankful for this year

There are a few groans from the guests

C’mon Please I’m going to start
(raising her wine glass)
I’m thankful for Richard and Rachel --

Sadie hoots and raises her glass she’s already had a few
Our couple is surprised by the attention

--for taking such good care of our
daughter Sadie and giving her a
great home-base in Manhattan where
she has the love and support she
needs in order to begin her new life
there

(addressing them directly)
I know it has been a tough time for
you guys And the fact that you are
taking care of someone else’s child
when you’re struggling to have one
of your own is just more evidence of
your incredible generosity I hope
some day we can repay you for all
that you’ve done

CHARLIE
Here here

Everyone toasts Rachel and Richard who blush humbly Rachel
blinks to hold back tears

SADIE
Can I be next

CYNTHIA
Sure honey Go ahead
Cynthia sits down and Sadie stands up

SADIE
Okay That was beautiful and it’s the
perfect prologue for what I wanted to
say I’m also thankful to Rachel and
Richard for all they’ve done for me
over the years From letting me intern
at their theater company

RICHARD
Free labor is more like it

SADIE
to employing me at the Pickle
Guy offices And most recently
letting me crash at their place
until I get my act together I’m
especially thankful to you Rachel
for reading all my lame attempts at
play-writing and short fiction

Rachel flicks her hand and shakes her head

And for taking me seriously as an
artist when I have such a hard time
doing it myself And finally this
seems like the perfect occasion to
share some exciting news I’m
going rogue here I haven’t cleared
this with Rachel and Richard but I
can’t let this moment go to waste

Rachel and Richard’s smiles dissolve as it dawns on them what

Sadie is preparing to say

Cynthia’s jaw drops open as she comes to a different

conclusion She catches Rachel’s eye and mouths to her

you pregnant” Rachel shakes her head

Richard speaks up but not with enough force to stop this

runaway train

RICHARD
Uh Sadie I’m not sure this is

SADIE
(misunderstanding smiling)
No it’s okay
(back to the group)
See the thing I’m most thankful
for this year is the opportunity to
help Richard and Rachel

“Are

SADIE (CONT’D) RICHARD
-- make their dreams come No Sadie really don’t
true

SADIE
(waving him off)
By offering just a tiny bit of
myself I get to give these guys
the greatest gift they could have
asked for The gift of life An
oocyte

Silence as Sadie beams proudly Many of the guests look
around unclear about what has just been said Rachel and
Richard stare down at the table dreading what’s coming

CYNTHIA
I don’t understand What’s an
oocyte

CHARLOTTE

Isnt it like an egg

SADIE
That’s right I’ve decided to be
Richard and Rachel’s egg donor

Cynthia’s face darkens There are uncomprehending murmurs
among the guests

And if all goes well next year

well be giving thanks for the

newest member of our family
(raising her glass)

Richard and Rachel’s baby

The murmurs stop Everyone at the table stares at Sadie
until an ELDERLY WOMAN begins to applaud Cynthia shoots
the woman a look but other guests are already joining in --
the whole table is now toasting and cheering

Richard and Rachel sit in shock as they get their backs
slapped by nearby guests and others congratulate them

Cynthia grabs Sadie by the elbow and pulls her into the kitchen
Meanwhile UNCLE BOB taps his glass with his spoon

UNCLE BOB
It’s my turn now right

As Uncle Bob stands we hear voices coming from the kitchen

CYNTHIA
I’m not anti anybody
Sadie opens the dryer and begins yanking out laundry and
stuffing it into a bag

SADIE
Oh c’mon mom On some level
youre threatened by her Is it
because she’ll have a book and a
baby and you’1ll have nothing once
Charlotte’s gone

Cynthia stands there blinking

CYNTHIA
That’s what you think I’m worried
about I’m worried about you You
could be squandering your future
fertility for all you know My god
you should be freezing your eggs not
selling them

SADIE
That’s absurd Tons of girls do it
and they’re fine Anyway I’m not
having kids

CYNTHIA
You don’t know that now

SADIE
Yes I do I don’t want kids I
want a career

CYNTHIA
You can have both
(off Sadie’s amused look)
What

SADIE

Do you know how many times you’ve
told me that women make sacrifices
when they have kids That you had to
drop out of school when you had me

(beat)
Look every month I get my period
and flush an egg down the toilet
Why not give some to Richard and
Rachel instead What could be more
meaningful than giving two people I
love who are desperate to start a
family the gift of life

CYNTHIA
Oh my god They’ve brain-washed
you

SADIE
(storming up the stairs)
Why do you feel so cheated by life
mom

INT EXT SUBARU - NIGHT

Richard and Rachel are buckling their seat-belts Through
the window they see Sadie hurrying toward the car with
Cynthia right behind her

RICHARD
Maybe we should’ve gone with an
anonymous donor

In the background some dinner guests roam the lawn like
Thanksgiving refugees

Sadie throws her laundry in the hatchback and SLAMS it
shut Cynthia stops some distance away and shouts at
Richard and Rachel

CYNTHIA
I know you want a child but this
is my child we’re talking about

SADIE
I am not a child

Sadie climbs in the backseat with the dogs Richard turns on
the headlights and starts the engine

CYNTHIA
If she was your daughter would
you want her to do this

Before Rachel or Richard can respond Charlie arrives with
some foil covered plates that he hands to Richard through
the window Then he puts his arm around Cynthia and waves
smiling falsely

CHARLIE
Thanks for coming guys Good

Richard backs out just as Charlotte joins her parents

family recedes from view

an arrangement among anonymous or
unrelated individuals but some
couples prefer to involve a family
member or a trusted friend which
is fine

anxious kids waiting outside the principals office

INT DORDICK’S OFFICE - DAY

DORDICK
Now that’s not to say that this kind
of collaboration doesn’t bring up
some intense feelings for everyone
including the extended family of
course it does This is uncharted
territory for most people But we’re
getting ahead of ourselves We don’t
even know if Sadie’s an appropriate
candidate for egg donation

Dordick’s speech continues over --
A MONTAGE following Sadie through her screening process --
INT DORDICK’S - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY

Sadie in a gown is weighed by a NURSE she has her blood
pressure measured her blood drawn

DORDICK (VO)
My advice is get the process started
and use the time to try and wrap your
head around what this arrangement
will mean for you and your family

IN THE BATHROOM --
Sadie pees on the toilet She pulls a cup from between her
legs screws on the lid and places it on a shelf in front
of a SMALL METAL DOOR The door opens startling Sadie
and a woman’s hand snatches the cup

Sadie thinks then fills in the bubble marked “False”
CLOSE on another statement

I am very seldom troubled by constipation

Sadie looks at the question disconcerted then answers
PAN DOWN PAST THREE MORE STATEMENTS

Evil spirits possess me at times

I would like to be a singer
No one seems to understand me

Sadie flips through the booklet and finds HUNDREDS of similar
statements including the FINAL ONE

At times I feel like smashing things

INT PSYCHOLOGIST OFFICE - DAY
Sadie talks to a FEMALE PSYCHOLOGIST who takes notes

SADIE
So we’re not really related
which is probably better for
something like this

An uncomfortable pause as the psychologist stops writing and
looks over the top of her glasses at Sadie

PSYCHOLOGIST
Because otherwise it would be
incest

A moment as Sadie puts this together

SADIE
Yeah Right There’s that So

INT RACQUETBALL COURT - DAY
Charlie and Richard guzzle water

CHARLIE
For the record I don’t have a
problem with the whole donor thing

Richard looks at Charlie surprised

That’s not to say I don’t think it’s a
little weird -- it is But hey I’m
a periodontist -- I graft freeze-dried
cadaver bone into the mouths of living
people every day I can handle weird
Cynthia is different She’s much
more sensitive Especially these
days She’s been having a really tough
time -- hormonally

INT CHARLIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Cynthia stands at a MAGNIFYING MIRROR moving her finger
across her jaw feeling something She leans in and lifts
her chin

IN THE MIRROR her magnified chin sprouts ONE BRISTLY HAIR

Cynthia locates some TWEEZERS and tries to grab the offending

hair Her first attempt fails so she tries again pulling

her lips into her mouth GOT IT

She holds the tweezers up to examine the wiry whisker then

notices a PIN-SIZED DROP OF BLOOD on her chin She grabs

some toilet paper and dabs at it

CHARLIE
He’s good

CYNTHIA

CHARLIE

He says Sadie’s doing a great job

at the Pickle Guy offices Maybe

you should give her a call
(hesitant)

they’re screening her

CYNTHIA
(looking up)
Who’s screening her

CHARLIE
The clinic For the egg donation

Cynthia stares at her husband then returns to moisturizing

Maybe you want to talk to her about
it

CYNTHIA
She doesn’t need my permission

CHARLIE
That’s true She doesn’t She’s
hell-bent on the idea no matter
what anyone says Richard and
Rachel on the other hand aren’t
going to go ahead without your
support and this cold war isn’t
good for anybody

(pause)

Honey what if Richard and Rachel
were gay

CYNTHIA
Oh please

CHARLIE
I’m serious What would you say if
they were a gay male couple who
wanted to start a family and Sadie
wanted to help them

CYNTHIA
Id say mazel tov now go get
some girl off the internet and
leave us out of it Sadie doesn’t
realize what it is she’s doing
She’s just throwing her genetic
material around like it’s
popcorn Auctioning off family
property like it’s no big deal

CHARLIE
(almost to himself)
They are our family

CYNTHIA
What

CHARLIE
Richard and Rachel are our family

The words hang there Then Charlie notices something
on his wife’s face He reaches over to remove it and
Cynthia rears back

CYNTHIA
What

CHARLIE
Youve got something on your chin

Cynthia turns away and grabs at her chin to discover an
errant piece of toilet paper

CYNTHIA
It’s nothing It’s just
CHARLIE
It’s bleeding

She touches her chin with the back of her hand and sees a
little red smear

CYNTHIA
It’s just a thing A pimple
It’s fine My god

Charlie watches his high-strung wife grab tissues and press
them against her chin

CHARLOTTE (0S)
I got into Berkeley

The couple turn to see their daughter holding a letter

CYNTHIA

CHARLOTTE
My early decision letter came I

Charlie jumps out of bed and gives Charlotte a
congratulatory hug Cynthia’s eyes well up

CHARLIE
That’s great honey We are so
proud of you Isn’t it great Cyn

Cynthia is caught in a swirl of confused emotions but
she manages a smile

CYNTHIA
Yes It is It’s great honey
I’m so happy for you

Charlotte smiles then notices something

CHARLOTTE

What happened to your face mom
CYNTHIA

Oh It’s fine It’s just

into sobs

Okay here’s the good part Ms Barrett

and charismatic young woman --

Sadie beams and curtsies

decision to donate She is mature
and intelligent and it is likely
that she will comply with the
medical demands of the donation
In conclusion Ms Barrett is

Richard raises his hand Sadie gives him a high-five
INT IL BUCCO ALIMENTARI - DAY
Cynthia stunned sits across from her daughter

CYNTHIA

SADIE
Why are you so surprised

CYNTHIA
I’m not I’m just I thought

history dad does

CYNTHIA
It is genetic you know

SADIE
Okay Fine I have some
depression and anxiety Maybe a

over her own menu

Oh and by the way I talked to
Dad and he’s fine with it

CYNTHIA
He is

SADIE
Totally He said he thought it was a
wonderful thing to do for two people I
love He’s proud of me

Cynthia’s throat tightens
CYNTHIA
Well he always has been a big
believer in spreading genetic
material around without putting
much thought into the consequences

Sadie looks away and sighs

I’m sorry I’m sorry

She lays her hand on her daughters and looks her in the

You know I love you right
Sadie nods but not right away

And even though I don’t agree with
you at all -- I respect you And
if this project is something you
feel that you have to do then
you should do it

SADIE
So you’re cool with it

CYNTHIA
No I’m not cool with anything
Ever But I see how much this
means to you and I don’t want to
stand in your way I want to to

Whoa Christmas

LATER -- Sadie watches fascinated as Richard prepares a
pair of identical injections It’s an exacting process

Rachel nearby chomps on an apple

SADIE (CONTD)
(examining a vial)
What does this stuff do

RACHEL
Shuts down our reproductive systems
so they can synch up our cycles

SADIE
Yikes Any risk of like
triggering menopause

RACHEL
Technically it is menopause
Chemically induced but it’s
temporary so

Richard looks at Rachel who gives him a nod

RICHARD
One two three

He injects her as the CAMERA QUICKLY PUSHES IN toward Sadie

SADIE
Ouch Shit it stings

NOW IN THE BEDROOM

and high on hormones Sadie spins around in a VINTAGE DRESS
I love it

Rachel sits cross-legged sorting a pile of clothes

Are you sure you don’t want it
It’s in perfect condition

RACHEL
No It’s better for you I can’t
wear that anymore

SADIE
Oh no You’re not going to
start draping are you

Rachel gives Sadie a puzzled look

Oh god My mom went on this jag
and got rid of everything in her

closet that’s even remotely form

fitting

Sadie pulls off the dress and is completely unself-conscious
in her bra and thong underwear Rachel can’t help but admire
her young and beautiful body

And now it’s just like cowl
necks and tunics and draw strings
and shawls That whole Eileen
Fisher thing

She finds her discarded t-shirt and pulls it on

It’s like she doesn’t even have a
body anymore She’s just drowning
inside of all this fabric and erased
all sexuality from her being It’s
like she’s been spayed

(examining her arms)
Can I use some of your lotion My
skin is so dry I’m molting

RACHEL
Yeah Sure Whatever’s in there

Sadie leaves Rachel looks down at herself She is wearing a
large loose cashmere sweater-thing with kimono sleeves She
quickly pulls it off and tosses it in the pile on her bed
only to discover AN EILEEN FISHER LABEL staring back at her

SADIE (0S)
Oh my god My boobs are so big from
those drugs I look like a porn star

Sadie re-enters rubbing lotion on her face and neck Rachel
quickly buries the Eileen Fisher item

You’re going to be such a great mom

RACHEL
I am

SADIE
(sitting on the bed)
Uh-huh Totally I wish you were
my mom

RACHEL
That’s crazy

SADIE

No It’s not

(lays her head on Rachel’s lap)
I think of you like that sometimes
Like you’re my art mom And
Richard is my art dad And I’m
your art daughter And now it’s
going to be so intense because a
little part of me mixed with a
little part of him will be growing
inside of you

(a pause then--)
Do you think Sam’s attractive

RACHEL
What
SADIE
Sam who works at Pickle Guy
RACHEL
I don’t know I never thought
about it
SADIE

I think he’s attractive in a kind

of fucked-up-character-in-a-Sam-

Shepard-play way Broken but hot
(pause then --)

Do you think our baby will grow up

to be a writer

RACHEL
Yours and Sam’s
SADIE
No Yours and mine

Sadie’s weird choice of words hangs in the air A RING
TONE breaks the silence and Rachel locates her phone

RACHEL
Shit It’s my editor

She climbs off the bed and answers Sadie lays among the
clothes daydreaming about having an editor of her own
one day

RACHEL (CONTD)
Hi Liz

LIZ (THROUGH THE PHONE)
Have you seen it

RACHEL
Seen what

LIZ (THROUGH THE PHONE)
The email I just sent you

RACHEL WALKS INTO HER OFFICE

and goes to the COMPUTER Without sitting she CLICKS THE
MOUSE and scrolls through her In-Box then stops

RACHEL
Got it

Rachel DOUBLE CLICKS and looks at the screen Her expression

changes She is crestfallen

LIZ (0S)
Are you there

Silence Then Rachel walks away from the computer and we
finally see WHAT IS ON SCREEN --

IT’S A MOCK-UP OF A BOOK JACKET a young woman stands in a
field holding a wildflower as she gazes out over the
horizon Swirly lavender and pink letters read

Women’s Studies
A Novel
Rachel Biegler

EXT MIDTOWN STREET - DAY

Rachel hurries alongside her editor Liz who is in a rush

LIZ
It’s the book jacket Not the
book It’s a sales tool

RACHEL
It’s pink

LIZ
I knew you were going to say that

RACHEL
Well that’s because it is Liz

LIZ
It’s also green

RACHEL
When do I talk to somebody about
this

LIZ
That’s what we’re doing now isn’t it

RACHEL
My contract says I get to consult
on the cover Don’t I get to talk
to marketing directly

They slow down and then stop in front of a building

LIZ
Yes of course you can do that but as
your editor and friend I don’t advise
it It’s just not worth it I’ve been
through this a hundred times They’1l
pretend to “consult” and maybe they’11
tweak the font to placate you But
they won’t really change it And then
youll become known as “a difficult
author” Or more likely -- because
you’re a woman -- just a fucking bitch
If I thought this cover was going to
kill your book Id tell you They’re
casting a wider net They want people
to buy it That’s a good thing

Liz hugs Rachel goodbye and disappears into the building
Rachel stands there looking lost

INT RICHARD AND RACHEL’S APARTMENT - DAY

The dogs eat their breakfast Richard drinks the last of his
coffee and puts dishes in the sink Rachel yells from off-screen

RACHEL (0S)

It totally misrepresents the book
Then it’s like -- oh I just don’t
understand the business side of
things -- which I don’t --

As Rachel and Richard rush about preparing for the day
Sadie sits on her inflatable bed with a cup of tea watching
them go in and out of view

Rachel heads into the bathroom to wash up

-- but I do understand that if a guy
wrote it it wouldn’t be packaged like
a fucking cupcake I am so sick of
this shit It’s the same thing with
this whole fertility nightmare I
just feel so betrayed

RICHARD
By what

RACHEL

The bullshit I was fed in college
Feminist ideology The lie that I
could have a career then kids Well
obviously that hasn’t panned out

(spits toothpaste)
I should send them the bills for all
our IUIs and IVFs

RICHARD
You can’t blame second-wave
feminism for your ambivalence about
having a kid

RACHEL
(emerging)
I’m not ambivalent

RICHARD
Now you’re not because you realize
the boat is leaving the dock
But before You kept changing the
deadline remember “We’1ll start as
soon as I finish the play Right
after I get this story published
Once I’m done with the book ”

Rachel joins Richard in the foyer He’s pulling on his boots

RACHEL
Are you blaming me

RICHARD
I’m not blaming you I’m just
saying that we need to take some
responsibility for the situation

RACHEL
A lot of women have babies at forty-
one I thought I could too

RICHARD
Okay but I don’t think it’s Gloria
Steinem’s fault that we can’t get pregnant

RACHEL
Whose fault is it then

Richard is at a loss

Oh I guess it’s mine I was too
busy writing my stupid book

She lifts her manuscript and drops it so it lands with a thud

RICHARD
I didn’t say that

RACHEL
All the doctors ever talk about is my
advanced maternal age My old eggs
And then we’re in the middle of an IVF
and -- what a surprise -- your sperm
is like on a sabbatical

RICHARD
Whoa whoa What’s that supposed
to mean

RACHEL

Nothing Let’s just drop it

RICHARD
All I’m saying is we can’t blame
Doctor Dordick or Bella Abzug or
anybody else for our fuck-up

RACHEL
You mean my fuck up

RICHARD
Why do I feel like I’m in a Wendy
Wasserstein play
RACHEL

(pulling on her coat)
I don’t know but it’s our
anniversary today and I have to go
get a dildo-cam shoved up my
twat by Dr Dordick so can we not
talk about this anymore and just
repress it Or suppress it Or
whichever one is appropriate in
this instance so we can just keep
this train on track

A tense pause Then --

SADIE
It’s suppress

Richard and Rachel turn to Sadie

when you consciously forget

something that’s suppression

Repression is unconscious

LATER -- Rachel and Richard enter their dark apartment We
FOLLOW THEM as they travel through the foyer and into --

THE LIVING ROOM where they discover a beautifully set table

with flowers and candles Sadie pops up from behind the
couch with a homemade sign that says “Happy Anniversary”

Surprise

The dogs bark with excitement

A CAST IRON PAN as steaks SIZZLE Sadie stabs the steaks and
puts them on a dish

SADIE (CONT’D)
(calling out)
Did you ever read “Innocence” by
Harold Brodkey

RICHARD (0S)
Uh I don’t think so No

RACHEL (0S)
Me either

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Sadie as she carries the steaks into the
living room where Rachel and Richard sit at the table

RACHEL (CONT’D)
Wait Is that the Harvard
cunnilingus one

Sadie sets the steaks on the table and begins serving

SADIE
Yeah That one

RACHEL
It’s all about a guy going down on
a girl isn’t it

SADIE
It’s pretty life-altering

Everyone begins eating
I read it in a Contemporary Short
Fiction class Then as an assignment
I wrote a kind of tongue-in-cheek
response to it called “Experience”

RICHARD
No pun intended

Sadie gives Richard a puzzled look so he explains his mouth
full of steak

“tongue-in-cheek response” to a
story about cunnilingus

Sadie laughs Rachel rolls her eyes

What Someone had to say it
SADIE

(sawing at her steak)
I kept writing and re-writing and it
grew into this forty-five-page-
long thing Anyway it’s still a
work-in-progress but I was
wondering if you guys were
interested I’d love to hear your
thoughts about it

RICHARD and RACHEL
Yeah We’d love to read it Sure

SADIE

(between bites)
Oh my god That would be so great
But it has to be top secret because
my mom’s been asking to see my
writing all semester and oh my god
the thought of her reading about me
“choking on cock” even ina
fictional piece is horrifying
But it’s fine for you guys because
you know how life is You get it

Several beats of eating then --

LATER

A PRINTER spits out pages

RICHARD
I wouldn’t be so sure of that

IN THE OFFICE --

begins searching for something

She opens a drawer rifles around then closes it

some papers around and by chance uncovers --

What looks like two pages from a play
Sadie realizes the pages are taped to the desk and pauses to

read this curious document

US Hi I’m Rachel My husband Richard and I placed the ad

HER I hope I’m not disturbing

US No

Startled Sadie whips around and looks blankly at Rachel

We’re happy you called

RACHEL (0S)
Did you find it

The stapler That desk is a mess

Rachel goes to the desk and begins to search
slightly guilty

Sadie removes a small pile taps
the bottom against the desk to straighten the pages and

Sadie feels

She moves

On closer inspection

SADIE
I saw those pages and I thought you
were working on a new play

RACHEL
(amused)
Oh no That’s definitely not a new
play That’s our cheat sheet For
when a birth mother calls But it’s
been pretty quiet on that front

Rachel retrieves the stapler and hands it to Sadie

SADIE
So pregnant girls just call you
out of the blue

RACHEL
They see our ad online or wherever
and look at our pictures and read
about us and if they’re interested
they call

Rachel pulls the computer keyboard closer and opens a
website We see RACHEL AND RICHARD’S PARENT PROFILE with a
photo of them amid a cheerful cheesy template

RACHEL (CONTD)
Would you give your unborn child to
these people
(pause)
Oh I guess you sort of are

LATER --

As Sadie stands in the foyer pulling on her coat and scarf
she looks into the living room and sees Richard on the couch
leafing through her story

SADIE
Oh my god You don’t have to look
at that tonight

RICHARD
Hey It’s our anniversary I can
at least read about fellatio

RACHEL
Shut up

Rachel playfully throws a pillow and then pounces on him in a
burst of affection

SADIE
Bye guys

RICHARD

SADIE
(hesitating then --)
To meet Sam

Richard and Rachel are surprised but act nonchalant

RICHARD
Oh Cool

RACHEL
Yeah Cool

RICHARD
Welp Have a good time

RACHEL
Yeah Have fun
(unable to suppress it)
But don’t have sex

Sadie and Richard look at Rachel
I mean you know Not right now

SADIE
Oh

both parties agree So it’s up to
you Are we on a date
They stare at one another There are definitely sparks

SADIE
Good question

They stare some more Then almost imperceptibly Sam leans
in Sadie hesitates then swallows

I’m thirsty

toward each other and KISS

and kissed Nothing vaginal

At the word “vaginal” Richard springs up

RICHARD

reaches for a magazine of her own

You missed the appointment

SADIE

SADIE
I know I would never do that
What’re you talking about I don’t

Rachel gets up and walks away
Where are you going

RACHEL
To tell them that you’re here

While Rachel speaks with the receptionist Sadie glances
around nervously Rachel returns and resumes reading

SADIE
What’d they say

RACHEL
They might be able to squeeze you
in in a half hour
SADIE
Oh Okay Cool So there’s not a
problem then

beats her to it

SADIE
I can sit in the back

RACHEL
No It’s fine You sit up front
They climb in and Rachel hands Sadie one of the drinks

It’s a Green Goddess with a shot
of wheat grass

Richard takes a closer look at Sadie and notices she looks
blotchy and weepy

RICHARD
Are you okay

Sadie nods yes and sucks on her straw for a long moment
Then unable to contain her emotions she begins to cry

RICHARD (CONTD)

Oh no

RACHEL
Oh god honey I’m sorry I got so
mad I think I overreacted

Sadie shakes her head
That’s not it

She shakes her head again Finally she manages to speak
through her tears --

SADIE
The doctor yelled at me and said my
eggs weren’t developing on schedule

RACHEL
What

RICHARD
Dordick yelled at you

SADIE
Dr Russell

RACHEL
Who’s Dr Russel

SADIE
I think that was his name He said
I didn’t have enough follicles
That I was a “low responder” That
someone my age should have way
more And they’re not growing at
the right rate or something He
said he’s had forty-one-year-olds

full tea kettle

SAM
Sadie

SADIE (0S)
Huh

SAM
Are you freaking out

SADIE (0S)
Uh No Not really Should I be

SAM
No

SADIE (0S)
Cool

SAM
Cool What about Richard Was he
freaked out

SADIE (0S)
Nope He was cool with it I
wouldn’t worry about it Sam

SAM

concerned

Well there’s nothing to be
concerned about Everyone involved
is pretty evolved

SAM
You just seem kind of distant

SADIE (0S)
I’m in the bathroom

SAM
I mean the other morning You left
before I woke up

A SLIVER OF SADIE through the edge of the stall door She
places a syringe between her teeth and wipes her belly with an
alcohol swab

SADIE

It wasn’t him He didn’t tell me

to do it
(off their confusion)
I did it myself

RACHEL

SADIE
I increased the dosage on my own

preoccupied Didn’t we do this

her feet are at the top

Anyway I’m trying to talk to you
about something important

RICHARD
What

RACHEL
My endometrium

RICHARD
(swabbing her)
What about it

RACHEL
Its thickness effects implantation
And today when I went for my
ultrasound mine measured eight point
two millimeters Ideally you want
anywhere from eight to ten on the day
of the transfer so I’m already there

RICHARD
(detached)
That’s great honey

Richard stabs the needle into Rachel’s haunch She barely
flinches He presses the plunger then pulls it out
RACHEL

I know all this stuff with Sadie is
upsetting and I want to be
sympathetic but the transfer is in
two days and my acupuncturist said I
need to create a really warm
welcoming non-negative environment
so the embryo will attach She told
me to eat warm food No salads
Soups and stews And she told me to
laugh Richard I’m supposed to
laugh But I’m not laughing

(starting to cry)
If you were an embryo would you
want to attach to a negative cold
environment No You’d want it to
be warm and funny and positive

To walk the dogs

IN THE BEDROOM -- LATER (NIGHT)

They lie in bed -- Richard on his back eyes open Rachel
curled up facing the wall We hear a party going on in the
apartment above them

Richard

RICHARD
Don’t those people ever fucking
stop partying

Richard stands up on the bed and BANGS the ceiling with a
book It works The music is lowered

RACHEL
Did you hear me

RICHARD
I did And I know that
intellectually I’m supposed to
do something for you right now --
comfort you or whatever but I’m
sorry I can’t right now I just
don’t have it in me
RACHEL
(very low shaky)
Okay

A long painful silence

RICHARD
Youre going to hate me for saying
this you’ll think it’s hideous
sacrilege but I’m actually sort of
glad the cycle didn’t work
because at least now it’s over

Rachel turns to him aghast

I know it’s a harsh but that’s how I
honestly feel Relieved I don’t
think I even want to have a kid
anymore I just want my life back I
mean look at us We’re a mess It’s
like we’re not even in a relationship
let alone a marriage I’m not your
husband I’m just some guy who
injects hormones into your ass every
night We don’t even have sex

RACHEL
Wait is that what this is about Sex

RICHARD
No Yeah Well maybe I don’t know
What d’you think Do you think we’re
ever going to have sex again

RACHEL
Are you actually asking me that right
now or are you being theoretical

RICHARD
No I’m not Im actually asking
you -- do you think we will ever

have sex again

RACHEL
I don’t know Richard

RICHARD
You don’t know

RACHEL
No I mean yes Of course we
will At some point

RICHARD
At what point will that be exactly

RACHEL
I don’t know Why are you so
fixated on this

RICHARD
I’m not I’m just pointing out that
while we’ve been so obsessed with
this project we’ve had sex maybe
one time in eleven months and you had
to get trashed on a bottle rosé
before you would even consider it
Jesus Doctor Dordick is more
intimate with your vagina than I am

RACHEL
Oh my god Do you want sex right
now Is that it

Before Richard can respond Rachel opens a drawer and takes
out a CANDLE clearly reserved for romance then removes a
VIBRATOR from a draw-string bag

Because we just had a failed IVF
and I don’t know about you but
generally that makes me feel pretty
shitty and dead and despondent and
doesn’t put me in a particularly
erotic frame of mind But if
youre dead set on it I’m sure we
can manage something But I can’t
guarantee that it’s going to be a
hell of a lot of fun

She twists the bottom of the vibrator and it makes a loud
buzzing sound

Hey batteries still work It’s
our lucky day

She throws the vibrator onto the bed It bounces just
missing Richard Rachel crumples in a heap and begins to
cry The vibrator continues to buzz as we

Katrina and Spencer Trask the Wall Street baron and his wife
who founded Yaddo

Oh yeah

in their bags and say “Thank you” As they walk away --

Sorry about the environment

before she and her brother continue on their way

They look at each other paralyzed for a moment
Answer it

Richard flummoxed doesn’t respond so Rachel pushes her
mask up and answers it

Hello Uh-huh Yeah That’s us
(from their script)

“No Were happy you called It’s

and steps away from the crowd Richard watches her and we
hear pieces of her conversation

holding hands and waiting
