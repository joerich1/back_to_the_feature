FADE UP ON

A dun-colored FORT at the mouth of Tripoli Harbor Set at the
end of a breakwater the fort swarms with men and bristles
with guns BERBERS - BARBARY PIRATES mixed with TRIPOLITAN
REGULARS - are loading ramming aiming GUNS wheeling the
guns to face the sea

EXT THE FORT AND BREAKWATER CONTINUOUS

More BERBERS their clothes fluttering in the wind are
running along the breakwater towards the fort armed with
muskets Something is happening and happening fast

EXT OFF TRIPOLI HARBOR

BERBER WARSHIP flying the flag of the Bashaw of Tripoli
painted with verses from the Koran is making desperately for
the harbor and the protection of the fort’s guns The
warship is a hermaphrodite galley rigged also with sails
and a ram designed to close with and board other vessels
in any weather Her oars are working powerfully Her deck is
swarming with armed men and two GUNS are being fired from
her stern-castle at

(as spray explodes from the sea)

THE UNITED STATES FRIGATE THE PHILADELPHIA under maximum
sail Her rigging is swarming with sailors and green-
jacketed marines in the trees as sharpshooters The United
States battle flag is huge and streams forward Every eye is
trained on the chase

EXT PHILADELPHIA ALOFT CONTINUOUS

Leather buckets of water are dumped down the sails SAILORS
strain to trim the sails The crew is trying to make all
speed Sailors barefoot barechested strain further against
the tops MARINES climb into the tops and lash themselves

Splinters from the oars fly everywhere GALLEY-SLAVES fall
wounded in their chains

EXT PHILADELPHIA SPAR DECK CONTINUOUS

Marine LIEUTENANT O’ BANNON is checking his men’s muskets-but

consumption

EXT TRIPOLI HARBOR DAY

Coming past the breakwater PHILADELPHIA fires gun after gun
and demolishes the FORT at the breakwater’s end Masonry
flies everywhere

EXT PHILADELPHIA QUARTERDECK CONTINUOUS

As a large section of the FORT collapses not thirty yards
behind him and the Philadelphias cheer

DEVEREBAUX
May I suggest that we take this as
a sufficient demonstration and haul
off from the harbor

The captain ignores Devereaux
EXT OFF TRIPOLI HARBOR MOMENTS LATER

As PHILADELPHIA passing us picks up speed a SAILOR swings
out the weighted lead on its line to test the depth of the
water

EXT PHILADELPHIAS BOW CONTINUOUS

OQ’ BANNON and MARINES stand at the rail with weapons leveled
Except for the chanting of the approaching Berbers no sound

towards the rail Blood is trickling down his face

PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAINS POV
HUNDREDS OF BERBER CRAFT converging

PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAIN
No firing

DEVEREAUX
We should sell the ship dearer than
that

PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAIN
No gun bears

DEVEREAUX
Then blow up the ship

PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAIN looks confused he simply doesn’t
understand
PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAIN
One day you will command

PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAIN
The ship is indefensible Strike

DEVEREAUX

GO TO BLACK

EXT TUNIS NORTH AFRICA DAWN

It is sunrise and the faithful - those of them that there
are in this cosmopolitan trading port - are being called to
prayer We see the muezzin in his tower silhouetted against
the red East In the courtyard of a MOSQUE TUNISIAN MEN
commence praying Meanwhile woile all the Muslim world is at
prayer

INT A ROOM IN A GREEK HOTEL IN TUNIS DAWN

2 EUROPEAN MAN raises his face from a washbasin and looks at
himself in a cracked cloudy mirror He is in his thirties
His hair is cut short He wears a dirty French shirt WILLIAM
EATON is a soldier a scholar a diplomat and an American
at a time when that is a very new thing to be He looks at
himself as if he is his own mystery He uncorks a BOTTLE and
as the call to prayer continues pours wine into a glass

ANOTHER ANGLE ON THE ROOM

EATON drinking wine sits at his WRITING TABLE It is
covered with pberibboned DOCUMENTS MAPS some MONEY (not
enough it seems) in gold a STILETTO on a CORD 4 WRITING
CASE and a bundle which when unwrapped turns out to be

A BRACE OF HAWKINS PISTOLS

EATON takes up one pistol a gorgeous weapon inspects it
and puts the pistol down He looks up and sees

A BERBER woman sitting up in his bed staring at him She is
beautiful watchful EATON stares at her He finally nods
she should go

She stands and gathers her things quietly begins to dress
EATON at his table begins to write When the woman leaves
the room he looks up as if he might have said something

EATON goes to the window and looking down sees
THE CLOAKED WOMAN hurrying away down the dawn street

EATON turns regretfully from the window and looks around his
room He is leaving this too his pooks the good room He
drinks wine and then places the cork in the bottle

EXT STREETS IN TUNIS MORNING LATER

The burning sun has risen above the mud town Burnoosed
TUNISIANS are heading to work like men in any town in any
age SLOP BUCKETS are being emptied into the guttered street
by veiled women GOATS run loose everywhere The streets are
full of EUROPEAN SAILORS and REMITTANCE MEN in various stages
of disintegration

EXT THE HOTELS CAFE CONTINUOUS
Dissolute red faced EUROPEAN MEN (attended by Berber boys

as North Africa was the same sort of European resort as it is
now) are drinking raki and wine and playing cards
Unlike Eaton they mainly have powdered hair in the old pre-
Revolutionary style The SRCOND AND THIRD ENGLISHMEN
(assistants to the BRITZSH CONSUL) are wearing ruinous hats
A YOUNG SWEDE is doing 2 watercolor sketch or a crumbled
facade Also playing cards a GREEK A red-faced BRITISH
CONSUL wigged is preparing to deal a hand of cards and is
telling a droll story to a FRENCH TRAVELER

BRITISH CONSUL

(dealing PLAY ING-CARDS)
You mistake me Msieur It wasnt
just a ship sir

(raises eyebrow at

cardplayers)
The Americans in an attempt to
chastise the Berber despot have
lost a warship sir A frigate

SECOND ENGLISHMAN
(boredly looking at
CARDS)
“Millions for defense not one cent
for tribute”
(looks up at Frenchman)
Thats what the Americans say-

INT EATON’S ROOM CONTINUOUS

The DISPATCH CASE is tossed on to the beda blue uniform
coat of the United States Army anda SABER EATON grabs
PAPERS and stuffs them into a chest

EXT THE HOTELS CAFE CONTINUOUS

The FRENCH TRAVELER and the YOUNG SWEDE do not look as
pleased as the rest of the men at the table A HOTEL SERVANT
comes running up from the harbor and enters the hotel

BRITISH CONSUL

(noticing the SERVANT and

wondering about him)
He struck the United States colors
before the Bashaws batteries had
fired a gun Or so it is said
which is better than the truth

(raises glass)
I give you the American enterprise
and Jefferson hanged

The FRENCH TRAVELER looks down at his glass and does not
drink
INT EATON’S ROOMS CONTINUOUS

A knock at the door and EATON from his back waistband
produces another pistol a small wicked POCKET PISTOL
(which has a small carved fitting which allows it to be
carried cocked the piece falls away when the hammer is
packed) and aims it at the door The door opens carefully
The SERVANT sees the pistol

SERVANT
T am not a brigand

EATON
(still aiming pistol)
That is a guestion of opportunity

SERVANT
There is a boat

EATON
Secure it

FATON takes up a piece of money which he tosses to the
servant The SERVANT starts to go but then turns and says
something he is possibly not supposed to say

SERVANT
They are not to be trusted

EATON
(after a moment)
That’s all right Take my trunk

The SERVANT goes carrying the trunk EATON places and puts
the POCKET PISTOL into the writing-case after

DETAIL

replacing the hammer-fitting

EATON flips the STILETTO in his hand and places it in the top
of his right boot The knife is invisible but a lanyard hangs

outside the boot-top

EATON pours more wine into the wine-glass drinks it down
and whirls and smashes the glass against the wall

EXT THE CAFE CONTINUOUS

A BOY is selling cates

BRITISH CONSUL

She should have been in smithereens
or defended yet she was neither
and now she is Tripolitan

(to cardplayers)
Bid

(as if indifferently

looking at cards
Where’s Eaton

THIRD ENGLISHMAN
(looking at cards)
He has been in his rooms

BRITISH CONSUL
We refer to the United States
consul of this place Captain
William Eaton He has limited
consular duties to say the least —
American shipping is not
considerable — and he has offended
the Bashaw of Tunis continually
since his arrival He is persistent
in a delusion that he represents a
bona fide nation

SECOND ENGLISHMAN
(still staring at cards)
He is a significantly dangerous
person In his person

BRITISH CONSUL
(pouring drink)
Regardless of opinions of their
consul the Americans have lost a
modern frigate and 300 officers
and men And to that

All drink The FRENCHMAN smiling apologetically does not
The BRITISH CONSUL looks ready to argue with him on the
point but

THIRD ENGLISHMAN (OFF)
Careful

FATON seen through lattice is in an interior part of the
courtyard talking with a fezzed GREEK HOTELIER

SECOND ENGLISHMAN
(not appearing to have
looked at Eaton)
He is armed and dressed for
travelling
BRITISH CONSUL
Find out wno he’s sailing with

The THIRD ENGLISHMAN lays down his cards and slips away
INT EXT HOTEL CONTINUOUS
EATON with the Hotelier is nervously writing a note

EATON
(writing)
“The United States of America wiil
pay the bearer one hundred and
fifty Spanish dollars By my hand
at Tunis William Eaton” That
settles my bill

GREEK HOTELIER
When it is paid it will settle your
bill
(as EATON looks at him)
I am not saying it will not be

EATON starts towards the door The SERVANT laden with
Eaton’s baggage and the HOTELIER follow

EATON
If I fail to return and do not
write within the month you may sell
what I have left - that’s
agreeable

HOTELIER
(going outside with Eaton)
Most agreeable

EATON
(emerging into the light)
-and above all give my letters to
a responsible officer of the next
United States ship Who will also
honor that note
(to cardplayers)
Good morning

BRITISH CONSUL
No American ships will get past
Tripoli this year Did any get past
last year I can’t remember

SECOND ENGLISHMAN
(looking at cards)
“Millions for defense not one cent
for tribute”

BATON
An Englishman might purchase my
books Mr Mavrocordopolous Some
of them can read though not these

The FRENCHMAN stands interestedly

BRITISH CONSUL
(not looking up from his
cards)
tT admire your nerve Eaton But if
you are for Tripoli you - will not
return

EATON starts for the harbor The FRENCHMAN steps in front of
Eaton EATON who doesn’t know this man looks ready for a
fight

FRENCH TRAVELER
(after a moment raises
glass)
To the republic
EATON looks at him gratefully and after a moment nods

FRENCH TRAVELER
Bonne chance

EATON
(emotionally)
Sir
EATON heads down towards the harbor and we

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE MEDITERRANEAN DAY
A lateen-rigged BERBER TRADING VESSEL in cargo with a
Berber Master and Helmsman manned with five AFRICAN SLAVES
bowls east along the Lion-colored coast of North Africa A
plume of SMOKE rises from a brazier on board the vessel

TITLE

“THE BARBARY COAST OF AFRICA 1804
EXT THE DECK OF THE TRADING VESSEL CONTINUOUS

FLIES buzz around the staring head of a BUTCEERED GOAT The
BUTCHER BOARD is tilted and offal tumbles and BLOOD streams
into the wake of the vessel Other GOATS jostle in pen
amidships AFRICAN SLAVES are jibing the vessel le--ing over
cargo hauling on lines The other cargo is jars of oil
sacks of meal and oranges crudely piled GOAT MEAT is put on
the brazier

EXT THE AFPTERDECK OF THE TRADING VESSEL CONTINUOUS

In the shade of a fluttering awning EATON wakes from a brief
sleep and looks up in alarm He has not shaved in two days
and by the look of him has not slept in that time either
Immediately nearby we see his TRUNK against which leans his
SABER

The vessels MASTER sits on cushions beneath the fluttering
awning that also shades EATON The Master is most certainly a
Barbary pirate He smiles with carious teeth EATON takes up
a pistol and checks its priming

MASTER
(breaking an ORANGE with
his thumbs)
you are careful with your weapons

The BERBER HELMSMAN (leaning his thigh against the TILLER)
also smiles Near him in lashings is a rusted BLUNDERBUSS a
wicked bell-mouthed antique

EATON
I am a soldier

‘MASTER
I thought you were a diplomat

EATON
It depends by God on the occasion

MASTER
Indeed by God it does

MORE BLOOD drips into the sea from the butcher-table
EATON makes the decision to lay the pistol down on the wrap

He is aware that the men are watching him He stands hair
and shirt fluttering He sees
EATONS POV

SHARKS are rising in the bloody and glittering wake of the
vessel The sea is otherwise empty

MASTER
You will tell me the difference
between you and an English man I
cannot tell

FATON sits warily on the deck looking at the Master
EATON
You look much like a man from
Tunis but you are from Tripoli It
is a Gifferent thing

SLAVES HELMSMAN and MASTER laugh EATON smiles himself

MASTER
You have not so many ships as the
English
EATON
No No one does
MASTER
(aggressively)

Your country has one warship only

The FOUR SLAVES finishing the tack gather around as if to
hear the Masters wisdom One of the SLAVES wears LEG CHAINS
(With the COOKSLAVE (a huge man) and the Master and the
Helmsman there are seven crew in all) Flames leap from the
brazier The COOKSLAVE behind Eaton takes up a length of
ROPE

EATON
There are more warships Because
you do not see them in these waters
does not mean they do not exist

MASTER
Your country has one warship only
and this singular warship has been
surrendered to my Bashaw

SLAVES laugh sycophantically EATON aware of the movement of
men and the way things are going on the vessel is
developing an expression we will see again He is never not
afraid - he is too intelligent not to be afraid - but he
decides to act as if he is not afraid
be
mo

MASTER (CONTD)
I have seen European ministers as
you say you are

EATON
I am no European minister Hadj
Mohammed nor have I said it

MASTER
These travel with gold soldiers
and letters from my Bashaw It is
easy on Barbary to be taken and
kept until your friends will pay

EATON
(smiling)
That is because you are savages

after a long pause the MASTER laughs and then SLAVES laugh
so does the HELMSMAN Tension increases on the vessel

MASTER
You will pay me now I think That
is what I think you will do

A SLAVE starts towards Eaton’s TRUNK -- then stops

EATON
will pay you when we get to
Tripoli As agreed

MASTER
We are going to Benghazi

SLAVES move armed EATON picks up a PISTOL cocks it and
aims it at the Master The bore of the PISTOL is huge The
HELMSMAN watches in aiarm and glances towards his
BLUNDERBUSS SLAVES watch tensely now armed

MASTER

You have not slept Will you aim
that pistol at me all the way to
Tripoli Will you say Put me
ashore That

(gestures at the desert

abeam)
is Barbary And we are seven to
one

EATON continues to aim the pistol
jo
o

EATON

You would say that death comes when
Ged wills and that you do not fear
it Are you so pious now

(the MASTER seems to begin

to realize that EATON is

very very dangerous)
If I pull the trigger the odds are
no longer your concern

MASTER
You are outnumbered my friend Not
being reasonable when there is
nothing to be done is an offense to
God

EATON glances aside at his SABER which leans against his
saddle SLAVES reach for their KNIVES and CUTLASSES

MASTER (CONTD)
(softly)
You have not slept in two days

A PIKE slashes down and knocks down Eatons PISTOL which
discharges with a huge bang into the deck as the COOKSLAVE
whips the ROPE around EATONS neck and drags him to his
feet

EATON whips the STILETTO from his boot and punches the knife

backwards into the COOKSLAVES EYE The COOKSLAVE falls and

Eaton falls too losing the STILETTO grabbing his SABER and
drawing it

MASTER (CONTD)
He is armed

FATON whirls disemboweling a SLAVE armed with a knife who
smashes into oil jars He smashes a CUTLASS out of another

mans hand and hacks him down with a second blow the SECOND
SLAVE falling against—

the HELMSMAN who lets go of the TILLER WITH A CRY
EX™ AT SEA CONTINUOUS

THE TRADING VESSEL rounds spray cannoning over the rail all
the men aboard falling down

EXT THE DECK OF THE TRADING VESSEL DAY
CARGO and MEN tumble away from the weather-side as the deck

nearly goes vertical Everyone falls and some of the CARGO
(oranges sacks) spills into tne sea
ral

COALS spill from the BRAZIER on the weatherside of the
vessel and ignite SACKS EATON glancing up sees

EATONS POV
THE UNFIRED PISTOL skidding down the deck

BATON lunges rolls and as the vessel rights presents the
PISTOL at a THIRD SLAVE raising an AXE Other SLAVES are
getting to their feet All are armed The HELMSMAN sweating
curban unwound aims his BLUNDERBUSS

EATON pulls the trigger The wet PISTOL snaps and does not
fire

MASTER
God has done this

EATON slams the PISTOL lock down onto the BRAZIER and it
discharges and blows a hole through the THIRD SLAVE

The MASTER reaches for a SWORD

The HELMSMAN pulls the trigger on the BLUNDERBUSS and the
weapon explodes eyeless and fingerless smoking he drops
shrieking to the deck

EATON topples backwards over some Cargo shot in the arm but
stays on his feet and attacked by a SLAVE with a DAGGER
stabs the man and wrests the DAGGER from his hand and backs
away

MASTER
(advancing with sword)
Kill him

EATON presents the two weapons surrounded He is 4 19th
century man and very very good at what he is doingwhich
at the moment is fighting rapier-and-dagger style using the
dagger as main gauche

EATON disarms the first man and daggers him knocks a CUTLASS
into the sea hacks the second man down (dropping his
dagger) and whirling

BEHEADS a third and presents holding the saber two-handed
The last SLAVE hesitates holding a CUTLASS EATON waits
saber poised The SLAVE strikes and EATON trips him and hacks
gown as he falls through the air

The MASTER in the act of raising the SCIMITAR-
finds his weapon knocked aside spiraled out of his grip
and Eatons SWORDPOINT at his THROAT

The fight has taken seconds GROANS are audible here and
there on the vessel EATON ploody-mouthed twice-wounded
looks transported

EATON
That was a fight

The MASTER staring around at his vessei is inclined to
agree

MASTER
Unlike you I am reasonable

EATON punches the hilt of the saber into the Masters
forehead The MASTER thuds unconscious to the deck

EATON bleeding from the nose the head the gunshot wound
stands breathing heavily It has been only seconds

The TRADING VESSEL has fallen off the wind EATON ducks the
boom inexpertly slacks the sheets kicks out a small FIRE
started by the coals from the brazier EATON stares around at
the bodies wondering what to do next He obviously does not
know anything about boats He looks around at the sea and
sees something interesting

EATONS POV

SHARKS There are more of them now having been attracted by
the butchering of the goat

EATON turns and looks speculatively at the insensible Master
EXT THE TRADING VESSEL DAY

SLAVES BODIES float astern of the vessel drawers ballooned
and turbans unwinding SHARKS are hitting the BODIES

EXT THE AFTERDECK OF THE TRADING VESSEL DAY

RATON sits the dazed and expostulating MASTER on the
taffrail The MASTER clutches at him attempting to struggle
He is making odd gargling noises His eyes roll

MASTER
(rationally)
We are at sea You cannot sail

EATON
Thats not the point
He shoves the master overboard
EXT A BEACH ON THE BARBARY COAST NIGHT

The TRADING VESSEL is grounded on the wet sand Further up
the beach there is a tiny fire

EXT EATONS CAMP CONTINUOUS

EATON sits and stares at the fire then looks at the stars
and at the vast blackness inland It is obviously very cold
- the night-cold of the desert EATONs breath is visible
He mops at the superficial WOUND on his side We see (with
Faton) that a CRESCENT MOON has risen over the barren dunes
EATON takes up a MUSKET inspects and cocks it and then lies
down to sleep But his eyes stay open and he stares at the
fire

EXT THE BEACH EARLY MORNING

OPEN CLOSE on EATON asleep We hear before he does the

sound of footsteps on the sand and then -- the grumble of
camels EATONs eyes flash open HE up sharply grabbing the
MUSKET blinded by the rising sun He freezes -- and lowers
the MUSKET

EATONS POV
TWENTY-ODD MUSKETS - aiming at him
EATON dropping the MUSKET stares around at --

TRIPOLITAN LANCERS An entire patrol has surrounded his camp
The dead fire smokes LANCERS are looting the vessel which
is half afloat on the rising tide More TRIPOLITAN LANCERS
ride down the slope to the beach EATON disarmed is roughly
dragged to his feet He looks off and sees -- A TRIPOLITAN
OFFICER on horseback He is an intelligent-looking man of
nearly sixty He is not a Berber -- but a European — a French
mercenary - in orientalized uniform

FRENCH OFFICER (JOUBERT
Ce serait bien si vous parliez
Francais

EATON
It would be good But I dont
really Neither do I dance or
draw
to
Les)

JOUBERT
My men have seen no women for four
months and they have ceased to be
particular

(a beat controis horse)

You are English

EATON slowly shakes his head no
JOUBERT (CONTD)

(complicatedly)
Shit

EATON notices that the LANCERS holding him back off as
JOUBERT dismounts JOUBERT removes gloves and slaps dust from
himself continuing to stare hawklike at his prisoner He
holds up a hand to prevent a soldier from rifling through
Eatons gear The soldier and other soldiers stare Not
resentfully they obey Joubert Eaton notices this man gets
French discipline from Berber troops

EATON
My name is Eaton sir Captain
William Eaton United States consul
to Tunis en route to the court of
the Tripolitan Bashaw

JOUBERT
(indicating TRADING
VESSEL)
That is a Tripolitan vessel Where
are its men

EATON
(after a moment)
Its master was taken by a shark
The slaves were inconsolable sir
and jumped in after

JOUBERT
(after a moment)
They will do that

EATON
(politely uneasily)
You are French sir Your men
are Tripolitan regulars

JOUBERT
(taking WATER from
ORDERLY)
I serve the Bashaw
bo
ra

EATON
(apprehensively)
For France

JOUBERT

My France had a king That was when
my father was a Duke with on his
shoulders a head -- though
confessedly it was good for nothing
but adultery and cards

(washes face)
These days there is a Corsican at
Paris You have heard of this

EATON
With admiration

JOUBERT
You do not court my favor

EATON
My own father was a miller who
could not write his name and I ama
foreign minister Men must rise or
fall in our times We do not stay
in our places as before Neither
Bonaparte nor me

JOUBERT
A Jacobin

EATON
An American

JOUBERT
The Bashaw has declared war against
the United States Are you aware of
this

EATON had not known It is considerable information

EATON
Has my Congress declared

JOUBERT

That I do not know
(gives cloth to orderly)

I served with the Marquise de
Lafayette I was on his staff I
was at Yorktown when the British
surrendered It was a thing to be
seen

(MORE)
To
wr

JOUBERT (contd)
a beat)
But I serve the Bashaw now

EATON standing in the sea wind inclines his head
understanding perfectly

JOUBERT (CONTD)
You may keep your weapons I will
not take them But do not use them
(turning he shouts to
soldiers)
This man is a foreign minister and
my particular guest

EXT BEACH LATER

EATON who has put together his gear stands looking around
He sees something interesting Five BERBER VILLAGERS
prisoners of the patrol sit manacled and bloody on the sand
EATON registers this it is important LANCERS are still busy
looting the vessel as we can see as JOUBERT comes walking up
from the horse-pickets

JOUBERT
Among all this there is coffee
perhaps

EATON

There is a barrel of coffee on
board the felucca and all manner
of provisions You are welcome to
the boat and its cargo

JOUBERT
(drily)
I know

EATON looks nervously amused He likes Joubert

EATON
When I beached the vessel I thought
to go overland to Tripoli It
cannot be far

JOUBERT
Not far but infested with
brigands

EATON

I have a tolerable hard throat to
cut
JOUBERT
So did Louis Of France He was a
king and had an army

pocket-pistol JOUBERT sits down exhausted He washes his
face with a wet cloth which is handed him by a very
obsequious Orderly - who stares at EATON and then scurries
away

JOUBERT
Who is now the president of the
United States

EATON
Mr Jefferson of Virginia

JOUBERT

IT am not Surprised I knew him He
Was ambitious A Jacobin of
course but something admirable
with a pen He created a country
with a pen Imagine that It is
something to admire though the end
of all order

(as EATON Smiles)
I will take you to Tripoli f will
treat you as You see but I cannot

EATON
You do not need to Can You give me
news of the Philadelphia frigate
(JOUBERT Taises an
eyebrow)
It was laughed about at Tunis

JOUBERT
I should not laugh at the American
heavy frigates if they come But
Berbers do not know this Nor
astronomy nor Sanitation nor
anything else There is a story
about a Berber who wished to learn

Parable a tragedy complete with
hubris and hamartia You should
look it up
EATON
Do you know the condition of the
Philadelphias men

JOUBERT looks at him for a moment

JOUBERT
They are at Tripoli Therefore they
are slaves

EXT TRIPOLI HARBOR MORNING

The captured PHILADELPHIA is at anchor surrounded by BERBER
craft

EXT THE WATERFRONT CONTINUOUS

A new FORT is under construction AMERICAN PRISONERS under
the eyes of BERBER OVERSEERS are pulling a sledge piled with
stone They are in chains There are seamen boys and
enlisted marines — but no officers The officers of the
Philadelphia are obviously elsewhere

EXT THE PRISON ROOF CONTINUOUS

Some AMERICAN NAVAL OFFICERS (still armed with swords as
they are on parole of honor extended in those days to
officers) sit and drowse under wind-snapped awnings Some
walk up and down some look at the sea O’BANNON stands at a
parapet looking through a telescope

TELESCOPE POV (OBANNON)
AMERICANS are breaking and fitting rock building walls

OBANNON closes the TELESCOPE furiously A YOUNG NAVAL
LIEUTENANT has come up beside him

YOUNG NAVAL LIEUTENANT
May I use your glass sir

O BANNON
(turning formally)
You take this glass every morning
sir and every morning without
fail six you say Arab bastards
sir Then you eat figs sir and
play cards

Holds out the TELESCOPE The YOUNG NAVAL LIEUTENANT is
offended yet has no great desire to fight O’ Bannon
DEVEREAUX
(quickly intervening)
Officers fetch a higher price Mr
OBannon The Berbers dont want
to bruise us

O BANNON
Neither did our Captain wish to

bruise the Berbers

We see the fat CAPTAIN sitting under an awning and writing
in a ledger Another OFFICER is smoking from a hookah
MIDSHIPMEN - merely boys - are gambling

DEVEREAUX
(co YOUNG NAVAL OFFICER)
I apologize on behalf of Mr
OBannon He is more than most of
us agitated by confinement

The YOUNG NAVAL OFFICER looking sullen shoves off DEVEREAUX
takes the glass and looks at the harbor

DEVEREAUX
(quietly)
You were out again last night You
and Mr Parker

O BANNON
(unconcerned opening
TELESCOPE)
Someone has to count the Bashaws
guns

DEVEREAUX
Or spike them
(as OBANNON looks at him
expressionlessly)
Dont get caught

O BANNON
I am nearly bored enough to let
them catch me

DEVEREAUX
What was the ship brought in
yesterday

O’ BANNON
The brig Louisa Salem bound for
Constantinople with a cargo of
nails She was taken off Sicily and
half her crew kiiled

(MORE)

Re
O’BANWON (contd)
The men were taken to build a fort
at Benghazi Her master is at the
palace

DEVEREAUX
You should tell the Captain

O’ BANNON
Why

DEVEREAUX leaves O’BANNON He comes along to

PARKER who is amusing himself by carving PARKER in the stone
of the parapet He has got as far as P-A-R

DEVEREAUX
Mr Parker

PARKER
It was always my intention to leave
my mark

DEVEREAUX
Has OBannon been counting guns or
spiking them

PARKER
What has he said
DEVEREAUX
We are on parole of honor
PARKER
It is amazing what things get
called
DEVEREAUX

OBannon is a hothead He will go
nowhere Men like him never do
They think they will their
observers think they will but they
do not in the end You have your
future to watch for Audacity is
over-rated sir

PARKER is very pale The idea of a future seems to amuse him
faintly He leans against the parapet and coughs

PARKER
I think audacity can do me no harm

DEVEREAUX knows as well as anyone else that PARKER is dying
3C

DEVEREAUX
(ashamed)
Very weil

EXT THE DESERT APPROACH TO TRIPOLI DAY

As the COLUMN OF TRIPOLITAN LANCERS moves slowly along with
its train of manacled bedouin PRISONERS TRIPOLI dun-
colored complex minaretted is visible in the distance

EXT THE ROAD TO TRIPOLI CONTINUOUS

FATON rides at the head of the column of LANCERS with
JOUBERT

EATON
When will the Bashaw see me

JOUBERT
You are worth five hundred English
pounds He will see you soon
enough

EATON
(cautiously)
The Bashaw is not much loved by his
foreign officers

JOUBERT
The Bashaw is not “much loved” by
anyone
(looks at EATON drily)
I do not believe it is his
ambition

EATON
If he is feared he is not entirely
feared One of your prisoners told
me they burnt a barracks To whom
are these men loyal

JOUBERT
(dismissively)
God
(after a long pause)
The Bashaw has a brother

EATON
A younger brother

JOUBERT
(uncomfortably)
An elder brother
BATON registers this it is huge information

EATON
Yusuf Bashaw is a pretender

JOUBERT
He pretends very well

BATON
An elder brother would be the right
Bashaw of Tripoli

JOUBERT
I am not a court of heraldry

EATON
Was he driven off this rightful
Bashaw Does he work against his
brother

JOUBERT

Hamet Karamanli is in Egypt hiding
from assassins He is paid a
pension by the Turks I think he is
also paid something by the English
He is a scholar Effete He has
lived in Paris He will not return
He does not want the throne

EATON
Yet the people would prefer him on
it

JOUBERT
The question which should obsess
you is whether or not you will be
ransomed

EATON
I am a United States envoy on a
diplomatic mission I cannot be
taken prisoner even in this case of
war

JOUBERT
(reining in horse)
You were not sent my friend you
simply came The Bashaw castrated
the Dutch minister and kept him in
a cage Only the English escape
insult

Wy
v3
tO

EATON
The point of the Royal Navy cannot
fail to be plain to the chief of
the Barbary pirates
(rides)
We do not pay Yusuf Bashaw for
passage in the Mediterranean

JOUBERT
There is more in the matter than
that Why do you think the Bashaw
has lately singled out American
ships

EATON
Because what navy we have is in
Boston and not here Mr Jefferson
does not believe in “foreign
adventures”

JOUBERT
And you do I think There is
another reason American ships are
taken The English do not need to
pay tribute to the Bashaw He is
afraid of the British navy And who
is not But -- each year -- the
English pay him for something

EATON looks at JOUBERT - and then nods gratefully JOUBERT
has given him vast diplomatic information

JOUBERT (CONTD)
I will not deliver you to the
palace You may surrender yourself
from the French consulate

EATON
That would be the Emperors
consulate IJ thought you were a
royalist

JOUBERT
So is Citizen Bertrand if you
scratch his paint

THE COLUMN moves on through the dust towards the desert gates
of Tripoli

EXT A TRIPOLITAN BAZAAR DAY

A party of manacled PHILADELPHIAS is being whipped through
the crowded streets

The crowd pelts them with garbage and stonesand A UNITED
STATES FLAG is torn to pieces - popular in the Arab world
then as now THE PRISONERS are driven towards the iron gates
of the lower floors of tne PRISON

EXT A BALCONY AT THE FRENCH CONSULATE CONTINUOUS

BERTRAND the French consul at Tripoli watches as the
American SAILORS are flogged through the streets The tumult
is incredible BERTRAND is‘a nervous Civilized man driven
to the brink by the disorder and barbarity

BERTRAND
According to the terms of the
frigate’s surrender the officers
may walk about the town They visit
the public women The ordinary men
aS you see are ina different
condition It is customary here
(BERTRAND takes snuff off
the back of his hand)
There is nothing to be done Even
if you had authority there would be
nothing to be done And you do not
as we know have authority

EATON who has shaved and dressed in his best suit of
clothes stares down at the crowd gripping the balcony rail

EATON
Have you met the Bashaw’s brother
Citizen Bertrand

BERTRAND
aware of a listening
SERVANT)
I would prefer that we had a sane
conversation

But EATON stares at him

BERTRAND

(after SERVANT leaves)
There is a cult of Hamet in the
provinces They pray for his
return Yet their hero or so I
hear petitions for a Passport to
France He is watched of course
By the Turks

EATON
By the British
BERTRAND
By anyone interested in the status
quo here

EATON
Are you interested in the “status
quo”

BERTRAND

I am interested in good dinners
and survival

(irritated by EATON’s

continuing curiosity)
He does not want to be king but he
isa stray and exiled one and such
are dangerous at all times when not
dead I should not mention him to
the Bashaw He is the true king of
this place He does not want it and
I do not blame hin

EATON
Will you take me to the palace

BERTRAND

I must surrender you or I will be
compromised But Tf assure you that
now is not the time

(takes SNUPP again)
Joubert imposes on me He should
have taken you himself and in
chains

(moves to a TABLE and

Pours BRANDY EATON

shakes his head “no”)
No ones position here is secure
If the Bashaw gets a defective set
of playing cards from a
Marseillaise ship he is liable to
execute my secretary If he needed
money he would imprison me He does
not fear Napoleon Do you
understand what it Signifies not
to fear Napoleon Bonaparte

EATON
(staring down at the mob
in the street)
If you will not take me to the
Bashaw at once I must go myself

BERTRAND
You would be torn to pieces

Ww
a
EATON
Then escort me under French
colors
BERTRAND

What do you think you can do The
situation is hopeless

EATON staring down into the turmoil of the street develops
a look similar to the one he had before the fignt on the
vessel He is terrified yet still

EATON
Be that as it may I must go to the
palace
BERTRAND is wary of Eaton -- “loose cannon does not begin to
describe Eaton -- and loose cannons give Bertrand the vapors
BERTRAND

T will not escort you through this
FATON for a moment nearly gives up and then icily turns

EATON
Monsieur Consul Bertrand

BERTRAND turns

EATON (CONTD)
You are a royalist yet you are in
Bonapartes service

An ORNATE clock strikes on a mantle BERTRAND stares

BERTRAND
(conceding a palpable hit)
I will take you after we dine

EATON
I am not hungry

EXT A TRIPOLITAN STREET MOMENTS LATER

THE FRENCH FLAG flutters in the aix as a company of FRENCH
TROOPS force their way through the press of shouting BERBERS
EATON and BERTRAND walk warily side by side accompanied by
Bertrands SECRETARY who keeps his hand on his PISTOL The
French troops clear a way through the crowd towards the
gates of the Bashaws palace
INT BASHAWS THRONE ROOM CONTINUOUS

It is a pillared Moorish room It has nothing of oriental
splendor It is a dark grim place torchlit RETAINERS of
the Bashaw stand about the walls as do the FOREIGN MINISTERS
of every seafaring nation SOLDIERS stand guard nearby over
the BOXES OF TREASURE which are customarily never out of the
Bashaws sight The BASHAWS MINISTER stands nearby

THE BASHAW Yusuf Karamanli fat silky and corrupt is
seated on a dais ina jeweled throne which he murdered his
father to possess He is the absolute ruler of Tripoli He is

staring kohl-eyed at —

An AMERICAN MERCHANT CAPTAIN quite an elderly man bleeding
from the head He is forced to his knees in front of the
throne It is silent (Throughout we hear a Spanish
prisoner sobbing) But we do not see him at least in this
scene The AMERICAN MERCHANT CAPTAIN slowly raises his
eyes He is instantly cut across the face with a camel-stick

The BASHAWS MINISTER an evil toady He holds a camel-stick
and looks like he wants to use it again He shouts in Arabic

BASHAWS TRANSLATOR (OFF)
Do not look at the Bashaw

UNSEEN PRISONER
(whispering)
-dioDio

The BASHAW’S TRANSLATOR a slave He takes no pleasure in his
job

BASHAWS TRANSLATOR
The minister says you fired on the
Bashaws ships

The MERCHANT CAPTAIN is incapable of speech He has been
beaten so savagely previously that he barely knows where he
is

BASHAWS TRANSLATOR (CONTD)

(as MINISTER stalks

shouts)
You saw the Bashaws flag yet you
fired on the Bashaws ships

more Arabic)
They wish to know if you see the
Bashaws Spaniard
Slowly his chin lifted by the CAMEL STICK the MERCHANT
CAPTAIN looks off at something we cannot see He looks- and
then closes his eyes

CLOSE ON YUSUP BASHAW as interestedly he raises his kohlec
and belladonnaed eyes

YUSUF BASHAW
(softly in English)
Answer

The MERCHANT CAPTAIN nods yes

YUSUF BASHAW (CONTD)
Have you seen all that you wish to
see

AMERICAN CAPTAIN
(weeping)
Yes

YUSUF BASHAW
Then put out his eyes

A smoking RED-HOT IRON is instantly pulled from a basket of
coals

INT AN ANTEROOM IN THE BASHAWS PALACE CONTINUOUS

EATON furiously unsure of his position -- stands Staring
fiercely out of a window BERTRAND stands biting a knuckle
There is a tremendous Screaming from elsewhere in the palace
EATON looks around wildly yet as he does

EATONS POV

JOUBERT enters the room and says Something quietly to
BERTRAND

BERTRAND comes forward to EATON

BERTRAND
You are to be disarmed Give your
weapons to Joubert so they will not
be taken

EATON takes his PISTOLS from his belt and unexpectedly hands
them to BERTRAND

EATON
If I do not return to ask for them
they are yours I would not have
betrayed you

BERTRAND after a moment nods FATON unbuckles his SABER
hands it to JOUBERT EATON now carries onlv his DISPATCH
CASE which as we know contains the pocket pistol

JOUBERT
(looking at SABER)
I think I would have paid money to
have seen you use it on the
felucca

EATON
(quietly)
What of that

JOUBERT
Its master was taken by a shark
The slaves were inconsolable and
jumped in after

JOUBERT bows smiling and leaves the room carrying Eatons
SABER

BERTRAND
The chief eunuch is coming for you
Do not insult Islam or the Bashaw
(EATON says nothing)
You jeopardize us all What fool
gave you a consulate

EATON
(dazed buttoning coat)
John Adams

THE EUNUCH appears in the doorway as the two broad doors
(this is important) are opened by SLAVES The EUNUCH is

effete puffy corrupt he moves in a stylized way as if he
floats (Yet even he is not the man he seems)

EUNUCH
It is the Bashaws pleasure that
the American minister be received

BERTRAND
(sotto voce)

He is receiving you as a minister
even though you have no proper
papers Do not mistake how unusual
that is And I will give you this
An American squadron is at
Gibraltar Joubert said just now
wd
Xe

EATON
(quietly)
A squadron In strength

BERTRAND
A heavy frigate Another small
frigate and three sloops of war
The Bashaw knows The heavy frigate
is called The Constitution

EATON
(emotional)
The Constitution

BERTRAND

Do you speak the Arabic of this
place

(EATON nods)
Speak very little of it Do not
insult the Bashaw Do not threaten
him When they tell you to kneel
kneel Do not look him in the eye
If you look him in the eye you will
quite possibly be tortured and
killed Do not above all mention
his brother Do you understand

this
EATON
(looking intensely at
Bertrand)
Do you kneel to him A Minister of
France
BERTRAND
It is merely form It means
nothing

EATON who is very frightened still seems to differ He
looks at the EUNUCH

EATON
Take me to the Bashaw

BERTRAND stands staring after EATON and the EUNUCH then
follows

INT THE PALACE

EATON having come under guard is escorted quickly along a
passage This is not a grand passage the mosaics are
stained the troops sitting alona the hall are filthy EATON
is terrified and resolute Tie Le HUCH is explaining protocol
- 40

EUNUCH
When the bel is rung you will
kneel and then prostrate yourself
You will rise at the Bashaws
pleasure only You will not look at
the Bashaw

EATON is terrified They walk on
INT THE BASHAWS THRONE ROOM CONTINUOUS

EATON and the EUNUCH appear in the door Then as a BELL
tinkles they walk forward EATON is looking around -ddenly
he stops and (as murmur arises in the court) stares his
eyes widening

EATONS POV

A FLAYED MAN hanging in an iron cage He is weeping Flies
are audibly buzzing He is a Giacommetti figure in a foetal
position -- his head turns Bits of flesh and hair remain
but his lips and skin are gone Ee looks like a puppet His
eyes are burned holes

EUNUCH
It is nothing to do with you It is
a Spaniard

EATON looks ahead terrified walks forward towards the
throne THE BASHAWS MINISTER holding his stick is waiting
before the dais ARMED SOLDIERS are everywhere BERTRAND has
entered the throne room and is talking to a FRENCH OFFICER
Other EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS are watching

BRITISH MINISTER
Thats Eaton from Tunis This
ought to be brief

The EUNUCH steps aside and EATON is left before the throne
The BELL is tinkled again EATON does not kneel The BASHAW

stares back at him The court begins to murmur The BELL is

rung more loudly EATON bows courteously in the republican
way barely a nod He raises his head and terrified looks

the Bashaw in the eye

The Court explodes MINISTER and GUARDS start towards EATON and
Eaton is struck with a MUSKET BUTT He falls to his knees
dropping his DISPATCH CASE Then blood trickling from his
hair he gets shakily to his feet He picks up his case THE
BASHAW holds up a hand and stops his men from killing Eaton

YUSUF BASHAW
It is customary to kneel
Blood runs down Eatons face and splashes on his coat

EATON
I represent a republic sir As
representative of that republic I
may not kneel to any foreign
monarch As myself to prevent a
further question I will not

YUSUF BASHAW
Would you die for it

EATON
Yes

A long interval We hear the Spaniard sobbing EATON manages
to keep looking at the bashaw BERTRAND is staring Beside
him is a SWEDISH MINISTER and a DUTCH one

YUSUF BASHAW
aware that the presence
of the FOREIGN MINISTERS
is a mistake)
It is customary also to bring
presents

EATON
It is my feeling sir that you
have enough American things

MINISTERS stare The COURT is outraged YUSUF is irritated
intrigued

YUSUF BASHAW
You are the consul to Tunis You
have no letters You have no
authority You have no gold What
is there for me to discuss What do
you want War has been declared

SOLDIERS cheer When the cheering subsides EATON who has
paced turns on the throne and says

EATON
A condition of war changes things
very remarkably Yusuf Bashaw

YUSUF BASHAW
How so
SATON
You held American hostages Now
since you have declared war you
hold prisoners of war Therefore
according to the civilized usages
of war I demand their good
treatment until their regular
exchange All of the prisoners
sir Not just the officers

FOREIGN MINISTERS murmur to each other the COURT is riveted

YUSUF BASHAW
You “demand” Who are you to
demand

EATON
In myself I am no one

YUSUF BASHAW
Do you think that I fear your
squadron

EATON
Were I you I should fear it But
you may do as you like

YUSUF BASHAW

We do not fear war It is what we
do

(SOLDIERS pound musket-

butts on the floor)
We have made our terms plain We
require tribute as we are paid by
the world As for what you call
prisoners they are slaves and
must be bought Your countrymen are
the most useful of slaves They
know many trades All of them I
think

(to sychophantic laughter

from the COURT)
They are improving our
fortifications

EATON
I saw

YUSUF BASHAW
Do you know anything about the art
of fortification Tunis consul

THE COURT roars with laughter
EATON
I know modern war siz in all its
parts On the whole I rather think
that you do not

YUSUF BASHAW
I do not fear America which is a
country merely at French pleasure
and because the British are
distracted with other wars I do
not talk terms with its Tunis
consul will not converse

longer With you -- or with any
American who does not come with
gold

EATON

Then you will converse with the
bayonet sir and come bloody off
your throne

EUROPEAN MINISTERS buzz among themselves YUSUF stares at
EATON

YUSUF BASHAW
Were you told to say that

EATON
Not specifically

YUSUF BASHAW
I admire it I admire it

The COURT laughs when the Bashaw does

YUSUF BASHAW
I admire it

EATON

(as the court roars with

laughter smiling)
I do have a gift for the Bashaw It
is a pistol silver-chased and it
once belonged to the King of
Naples It has a fitting which
allows it to be carried cocked
Have I your leave to produce it

Yusuf gestures get on with it EATON takes out the POCKET-
PISTOL holding it by the barrel SOLDIERS clench muskets

EATON thumbs out the brace turns presents and--
44

fires
The DUTCH MINISTER chokes on a date BERTRAND stares

THE FLAYED MAN shot in the head is quiet The cage sways
Blood spills onto the filthy floor of the throne room
COURTIERS MINISTERS AND BERTRAND Stare from the torchlit
dark of the arcades

EATON
It is Swiss It works

All the COURT stares Sweating SOLDIERS stare over their
muskets

YUSUF BASHAW
Come

EATON to the amazement of the MINISTER closely approaches
the throne EATON lays the SMOKING PISTOL on the dais The
EUNUCH (this is important) stares

YUSUF BASHAW
(to EATON alone)
You are unusual

EATON
Why bother with the other thing

YUSUF BASHAW
Do you think life is theater

EATON

It would not be a man in your
position who told me it is not

(THE BASHAW stares at

him)
The room is full of foreign
ministers Kill me after that and I
will be seen across the world as
what I am and you as what you are
You will lose your British
annuities and every government
which has ever been in your favor
Will you play politics Yusuf
Bashaw I am no consul yet you are
no king I demand the unconditional
release of the American Prisoners

YUSUF BASHAW
Be glad Mr Eaton that God
Protects the mad and that you are
worth a ict 9 money

EXT PRISON ROOF LATE AFTERNOON

AMERICAN OFFICERS line the roof staring as EATON under
guard is marched to the prison under guard Eaton has been
beaten horribly and is staggering TRIPOLITAN CHILDREN hurl
stones and dung EATON blood trickling down his face looks
up at the blackened fortress Among the officers O’ BANNON
and PARKER stare down

INT PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS IN THE PRISON SUNSET

FATON sits woodenly in a chair staring PHILADELPHIAS
CAPTAIN sits at a table OFFICERS including the
uncomfortable DEVEREAUX sit with him

PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAIN

(looking at Eatons

papers and then putting

them into a stack)
I cannot say that you exceeded your
authority You have no authority to
exceed None

(to OFFICER)
I believe somewhere in his mumble-
jumble he has confessed it

(to Eaton)
You have quite a reputation among
the Europeans of this place You
will behave yourself sir I am the
senior representative of the United
States in Tripoli and I command in

this prison

EATON
Congratulations

PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAIN
I have made terms with the Bashaw
on behalf of the United States I
am attempting to resolve this
situation

EATON
The loss of your ship sir

PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAIN
The war itself I will have order
I will not have rebellion
(to officers)
He needs quarters until the Bashaw
kills him
(to Eaton)
Which I will try to prevent
(MORE)
PHILADELPHIAS CAPTAIN (contd)

You are under house arrest Mr
Eaton confined to this floor of
the prison and to exercise in the
courtyard once a day

to OFFICERS)
Take him to the appropriate
quarters

OFFICERS stand They help Eaton to his feet
INT OBANNON AND’ PARKERS ROOM IN THE PRISON MOMENTS LATER

OBANNON is lying on a basket-worked Arab bed sweating and
batting idly at flies The door opens and EATON is helped
through the door supported by midshipmen DEVEREAUX with
them holding a candle

DEVEREAUX
Mr OBannon Captain William
Eaton Late the consul at Tunis
He’s to share your guarters

0’ BANNON
(looking at Eaton’s
injuries)
What did you do to deserve that

DEVEREAUX
He pulled a pistol on the Bashaw of
Tripoli called him a fraud and
threatened him with invasion

OBANNON looks interested EATON can hardly stand MIDSHIPMEN
carry in his CHEST DEVEREAUX nods at them and they depart

‘DEVEREAUX
Where’s Parker

O’ BANNON
He was with the surgeon earlier

DEVEREAUX
Good night gentlemen

DEVEREAUX closes the door Now relatively alone EATON feels
his head -- and looks at the crumbs of dried blood on his
fingers EATON sits shakily down and then he opens his
trunk and pulls out belongings

INSERT-

THE TRUNKS INTERIOR A false bottom is lifted revealing A
BRACE OF PISTOLS SHOT POWDER some GOLD

EATON takes up a PISTOL OBANNON sits up very interestedly
EATON checks the priming

EATON
Your captain is settled in

O BANNON
He was born to be settled in

EATON
(handing O’BANNON a
pistol)
You

Less so

PARKER comes in holding EATON’s SABER O’ BANNON suddenly

PARKER
A French colonel of Tripolitan
lancers brought it with
one oe os COMPLimentsy- --

EATON takes the saber

O’ BANNON
If the Berbers left you your sword
you gave your word not to use it

PARKER looking from man to man as on SOUND the evening
prayer is called looks thinner more ill

EATON
I am under sentence of death I
Just know a particular Frenchman
who knows precisely what he is
doing

PARKER and O’ BANNON look at each other

EATON
Iam leaving this place Do you
want to come

O’ BANNON
Neither Parker or I signed the
Parole We have always intended to
escape with information
PARKER
Ive watched the Berber craft
sailing in and out for a month I
know where the channels are and
have estimated depth at all tides
Ive made charts JI know their
naval strength down to a gun Mr
OBannons taken account of land
forces

EATON
What about breaking out the seamen
and marines

O BANNON
Wed need every officer here to
break in to the fortress where they
are kept and then wed never break
out It can’t be thought of We
have to get away with what we know
That’s all we’ll get away with The
quarterdeck officers will not be
persuaded

Eaton goes to the window
EATON’s POV

SUNSET bathes the old city in red light The evening prayer
is being called

EATON
Why are you different Mr Parker

PARKER
I have my reasons

O’ BANNON joins BATON at the window PARKER coughing quietly
sits on his bed

EATON
There’s a squadron coming When
it’s offshore would be the time to
leave

O BANNON
An American squadron Jefferson
sent a squadron

EXT TRIPOLI HARBOR NIGHT

It is a foggy black night There are few lights in the

town It is only with difficulty that one might discern a
winking of lights as if from ship t6 ship not far to sea

INT THE CELL NIGHT

EATON is asleep PARKER and OBANNON are asleep as well
Somewhere dogs begin to bark violently EATON opens his eyes

EXT THE OFFICERS PRISON NIGHT

THE PALACE is quiet dark We hear strange high-pitched
whistling sounds -- several of them —— and then artillery
fire slams into the palace

EXT TRIPOLI CONTINUOUS

RED HOT SHOT and shells from deck-mortars are smashing into
the town The top blows off a lighted MINARET Masonry flies

OBANNON and PARKER nod A GUARD comes around a corner
PARKER aims the pistol and O’BANNON takes the man’s musket
and smashes the man in the head with the head in it At thet
moment -- a wall simply collapses behind them The three men
scramble out over the rubble and disappear through the
smoke

DEVEREAUX watches them go He stands with OFFICERS who have
not seen

down His spectacles shattered More OFFICERS are shot down

EXT A WATERFRONT STREET CONTINUOUS

TOWNSPEOPLE look fearfully out through their shutters as the
American artillery falls upon the town Women are keening and
wailing Over everything is the distant thunder of the
cannonade EATON OBANNON and PARKER come quickly down the
street hurrying past a firing TRIPOLITAN BATTERY on a
terrace above the harbor

EXT A NARROWER PASSAGE CONTINUOUS

TWO TRIPOLITAN SOLDIERS stand staring towards the harbor
Their faces are lit with the red glare of the bombardment

EATON sees the soldiers and holds up his hand for PARKER and
OBANNON to slow down PARKER is running full tilt -- he
trips and falls

PARKER
Damn

At the sound of English the SOLDIERS look around and one
fires OBANNON falls grazed on the head EATON flies at the
SOLDIERS EATON knocks down the first with a tremendous
clash of steel PARKER on his feet again coolly pistols the

RED-HOT SHOT smashes into tied-up trading vessels and
gunboats all along the waterfront igniting them striking
their magazines blowing them into the air

EXT PLAZA ABOVE THE QUAY CONTINUOUS

EATON OBANNON and PARKER walk against the flow of running
BERBERS They are dependent on the confusion A red hot shot
strikes pavement throwing sparks and skips inland to smash
through a doorway The interior of the house catches fire

EXT TRIPOLITAN WATERFRONT CONTINUOUS
EATON drops down behind a cart checking his PISTOL
EATON

PARKER
Use the sweep

A TRIPOLITAN SOLDIER the light of a burning warehouse behind
him comes forward suspiciously -- and throws his MUSKET to
his shoulder

EATON raises the PISTOL -- and fires simultaneously The
BERBER falls an eye shot out PARKER grazed along the ribs
falls while grappling with the lateen rig PARKER tries to
stand and falls He gives a lunge and pulls up the lateen
sail which fills with wind He slumps against the gunvwale

of sailing

desultory way at salt beef and ships biscuit PARKER is

EATON and PARKER look up sharply A midshipman comes along
the spar-deck

MIDSHIPMAN (CONTD)
Captain Preble will see you at
once sir

EATON wipes his mouth and gathers up his things OBANNON
speculatively watches him go

O BANNON
Tell him I want something to do

PARKER watches EATON go
INT PREBLES CABIN MOMENTS LATER

PREBLE is a Maine sailor and consummate naval officer in
his 50s He does not respect rules He is sorting through
papers and does not look up EATON does not know the first
thing about PREBLE He stands at attention -- civil
attention not military attention

PREBLE
This afternoon I received
emissaries from the Bashaw who
prays that I cease bombardment of
his city The Bashaw says also
that you representing yourself
falsely as a United States envoy
threatened him with a pistol
That you caused two Philadelphias
to break their parole That you
murdered several of his subjects
and in bloody and violent fashion
escaped not imprisonment but
consummate Berber hospitality

EATON
The Bashaw entertains himself with
terminology

PREBLE
The Bashaw is a son of a bitch

EATON
Yes sir

PREBLE
You are or were the United States
consul to Tunis What were you were
doing at Tripoli sir

EATON
I am under orders to further United
States interests in the Barbary
States I thought that I might
present an argument for the release
of the prisoners I do not have to
justify my actions sir We are far
from Washington City

PREBLE
(appraising Eaton)
You did not know I was in the
Mediterranean

EATON

Not until I was at Tripoli sir
no
PREBLE

You speak their gibberish

EATON
Yes

PREBLE

I sent a sloop to Tunis to collect
you only to find you here I might
have been able to use you in these
negotiations sir but now the
Bashaw has a price on your head
and I must think of another use for
you I was told to look you up in
the case of land operations

(EATON nods becoming very

interested)
I have full authority to either
make war or negotiate as I see fit
Your opinion Captain Eaton as a
gentleman of the diplomatic
service

EATON
I should make a gunboat assault
sack the city expose the Bashaw’s
head on a pike and leave not one
stone of Tripoli standing on

another

PREBLE
Have you been happy as a diplomat
sir

(EATON smiles)
Heavy gunboats are being built in
Sicily I may make no assault on
the harbor until they arrive When
they arrive I shall assault
Tripoli and either cut out the
Philadelphia or burn her But until
the gunboats arriveI am
constrained to blockade I dislike
stalemates sir I dislike them
exceedingly

EATON realizes that PREBLE is a man who may be amenable to
ideas He steps forward

EATON
How far is exceedingly

PREBLE
Speak your mind I dont have a
position I have a job

This is the best thing that EATON has ever heard

EATON
The Bashaw has a brother

PREBLE
So do I sir The significance of
his

EATON

The Bashaws brother is an elder
brother He is in Egypt but he is
the right king of Tripoli With
gold and guns he could be restored
to the throne as a friend to the
United States which put him there

PREBLE
With sufficient gold and guns
Eaton I could make my late
grandmother the Dowager Empress of
the fucking Moonand if it would
destroy Yusuf Bashaw I Have the
authority of the United States
Government to effect her
coronation Be specific sir

EATON
Yusuf Bashaw rules by two things
tyranny to make his people fear
him and largesse so that he will
not fear his people

PREBLE
It sounds like ordinary government
The difference sir

EATON
The Bashaw is a pirate His income
is from the sea By this blockade
in force you cut his income He
must then expend more blood than
gold and the more blood he
expends the more precarious is his
always precarious position

(MORE)
PREBLE is
perceived
lifetime

EATON (contd)
I know for a fact that the
provinces want his brother You are
before Tripoli Imagine the
rightful king of Tzipoli behind it
with an army and the country
openly in revolt

PREBLE
Would they revolt

EATON
Yusuf is a tyrant

PREBLE
So am I My men do not revolt and
they thank Christ for plum duff on
Sunday

EATON
It would cost you nothing to put a
force ashore Even the rumor of a
land assault being assembled in
Egypt with Hamet would improve
your position

staring at EATON EATON steps forward He has
aman who gets it and the opportunity of his

EATON (CONTD)
Two hundred Marines Ten thousand
in gold for horses and mercenaries
half a dozen guns I will go to
Egypt collect Hamet Bashaw cross
Libya raising revolt and attack
Tripoli from the land

PREBLE pours out a glass of madeira Then another

EATON
There’s more at stake than Barbary
Were not done with England
Theyll come for us again The
thing to do is to amaze the world
To make them notice us if only for
audacity Every European country
pays tribute to that butcher at
Tripoli and say we - us knock
Yusuf off his throne It would
change the world

PREBLE sits and stares at him for a long time Then

abruptly
mn

BS

PREBLE
Try it

EATON’s entire life is justified at this point He nearly
faints

PREBLE

I haven’t the ships to carry you
back down the coast with this king
you may or may not get I can land
you at Alexandria with an advance
party - what marines I can spare
and the two officers sou escaped
with if you find them suitable

EATON
I do

PREBLE
You’1l have nothing else until I’m
reinforced After Constellation
arrives I‘1l give you two hundred
marines eight pieces of artillery
and twenty thousand dollars in
gold For now Ill give you what
money I have Enough to start the
rumor and for you to get your king
down to Alexandria if he will
come

EATON

(looking at MAP)
We’1l need to be reinforced by
ships at Derna Here You need
it anyway It is the key to
supplying any action against
Tripoli It’s garrisoned Ill have
to take it supported by naval
gunfire Can you rendezvous with me
here on the 20th of the next month
I can get there by the 20th If
Hamet will not come I will be there
with an army myself

(paces and look around at

Preble)
It can’t be a rumor in the end If
I get Hamet he has to be
supported The treaty must say
this
wm
tO

PREBLE
It will You are appointed Naval
Agent to the Barbary States with
full power to sign and negotiate a
treaty with this Hamet Bashaw

EXT A DESERT VILLA NEAR WHEATFIELDS DAY

Before the villa there is a permanent BERBER CAMP complete
with women and children EATON reins in The MEN start to
emerge from the tents to inspect him EATON rides forward
slowly

RAIS MOHAMED - a Berber brigand and Hamets number one He
is a slave He comes forcefully out of a tent to glare at
EATON Another man joins him but they do nothing say
nothing They verify that EATON is alone and then lower
their weapons

More BERBERS appear to stare They are soldiers too long in
camp -- unshaven malevolent overfed They follow after
EATON as he continues towards the villa EATON rides faster

EXT THE FRONT OF THE VILLA MOMENTS LATER

The villa is a gorgeous place at the edge of the great
desert It looks like some parts of it could originally have
been Roman Date-palms sway in the breeze SERVANTS come out
onto the colonnade as EATON comes up VEILED WOMEN and some
CHILDREN stand in the palm-garden watching EATON dismounts

Bashaw of Tripoli on the urgent
business of the United States of

THE TURKISH SERVANT is mystified EATON becomes slightly
nervous

TURKISH SERVANT
What is the United States of
America

EATON ignoring the faint protest of the Turkish Servant
strides through into the courtyard of the house

INT COURTYARD OF HAMETS VILLA CONTINUOUS

EATON steps into the courtyard WOMEN run off through a
doorway We hear falling water EATON walks into the shade of
a latticed area SLAVES batting fans look up boredly EATON
stares his eyes adjusting to the dark He looks somewhat
disappointed

EATONS POV

A GROSSLY FAT MAN is sleeping on a couch snoring He is
dressed in Turkish finery and snoring EATON stands in the
archway silhouetted against the glare He looks disappointed
aesthetically as much as anything else

EATON
Hamet Bashaw

THE FAT MAN wakes and stares wildly first at EATONbut
then past him EATON realizes slowly that there is someone
behind him He slowly turns and we see

HAMET He stands silhouetted in the doorway a PISTOL in his
hand He is no Arab dandy He is an intelligent man in plain -
- almost jesuitical -- black European clothing (Hamet never
dresses as a Berber) He is unlike his brother He is an
educated philosophical man FATON steps forward and stands
staring at him

HAMET inspects EATON He puts the PISTOL aside

HAMET
Iam Hamet That is the man who
brings me my pension for not being
king

‘ EATON
I think in that case especially
Bashaw tnat we should talk alone

The FAT MAN already having struggled to his feet hurries
out of the room salaaming and staring at EATON HAMET

closes a drapery

HAMET
(apprehensive)
What do you want

EATON
Do you know what the United States
of America are

HAMET
Did you come here specifically to
insult me

EATON
Your servant

HAMET
My servant is an idiot His
advanced idiocy is much to my
advantage because he is a Turkish
spy You are American I presume
that you represent your government
What do you want

EATON
The United States wants what you
want Bashaw Yourself at Tripoli

HAMET looks as if he is in sudden private pain He takes a
very long time to speak

HAMET
And that is what I want

EATON

(nervously)
Isnt it

(HAMET says nothing)
The United States government is
disaffected with your brother and
supports you for the throne at
Tripoli sir Gold guns and
marine soldiers are being landed at
Alexandria

HAMET turns and looks at EATON fiercely
EATON
(continuing)
i have a treaty here that secures
you American support if you will
make an attempt on Tripoli and I am
empowered to sign it as Naval Agent
to the Barbary States

EATON nervously takes the treaty out of his coat HAMET
does not move to take it The sound of falling water distant
cries HAMET turns exhales and looks out across his
gardens He glances aside at his table of SCIENTIFIC
instruments He looks broken in some way and panicked but
not when he turns to face EATON he is composed

HAMET
What is your name

EATON
William Eaton Bashaw

HAMET abandoning the attempt to be polite stares again
across his gardens

HAMETS POV
HIS WIVES AND CHILDREN are chasing around the garden

HAMET
I have a serious question

EATON
(seriously)
I will try to answer Bashaw

HAMET
Do you like fish

INT HAMET’S DINING ROOM NIGHT

Dinner is finished The room is open to the air Muslin blows
in the windows RAIS MOHAMED is sitting on cushions staring
at EATON suspiciously EATON by candle-light is reading the
TREATY

EATON
The treaty begins sir “God is
infinite”

HAMET
(smiling)
Was that put in for me
RAIS MOHAMED
(quite seriously)
“God is infinite’ that is good

EATON
“There shall be a firm and
perpetual peace-”

RAIS MOHAMED
God is infinite Or do you not
think so

EATON

(irritated by Rais

Mohammed)
“-between the Government of the
United States of America and His
Highness Hamet Karamanli Bashaw
legitimate sovereign of the kingdom
of Tripoli and between the
citizens of the one and the
subjects of the other”

HAMET
Citizens subjects The difference
is semantical in the end I think

EATON

glancing up at HAMET and

stolidly reading on)
“The Government of the United
States shall use its utmost
exertions to re-establish Hamet
Bashaw in the possession of his
sovereignty of Tripoli against the
pretensions of Yusuf Bashaw who
obtained said sovereignty by
treason and who now holds it by
usurpation and who is engaged in
actual war against the United
States”

(RAIS MOHAMMED belches

EATON stiffens and

continues )
In article three as you will
remember you are pledged cash
ammunition provisions and troops
in your operations against the
usurper Yusuf Bashaw

HAMET
You refer to my brother as usurper
most consistent

RAIS MOHAMED
And so he is one

HAMET
Every king is a usurper I believe
that Jefferson would say this

EATON
Republican sentiments will serve us
very little in an attempt to make
you king sir

HAMET
Read the part that refers to you I
find it especially fascinating

EATON

(uncomfortably)
“William Eaton a citizen of the
United States now in Egypt shall
be recognized as commander of the
land forces called into service
against the common enemy and His
said Highness Hamet Bashaw engages
that his own subjects shall respect
and obey him as such”

RAIS MOHAMED glares at Eaton

RAIS MOHAMED
Why

EATON
T’ll fight you any time you like

RATS MOHAMED spits EATON starts to stand

HAMET
(interrupting)
The part about Jefferson Mohamed
keep your tongue

EATON

(sitting down again so

does Rais Mohamed)
“This convention shall be submitted
to the President of the United
States for his ratification In the
mean time there shall be no
suspense in its operations”

HAMET
So I should begin with no
assurances

EATON
You have every assurance

RAIS MOHAMED
There are no assurances Would you
fight me on that

EATON
(after a moment)
No

RAIS MOHAMED
(leaning close to EATON)
I like you better

HAMET
Think of him as my solicitor
EATON
You could probably do worse
HAMET
(standing)

Walk with me in the garden
EATON and HAMET leave the room through blowing curtains
TORCHBEARERS light torches and go with them RAIS MOHAMED
stares dubiously after the men and then shrugs and eats

EXT GARDEN OF HAMET’S VILLA NIGHT

The gardens are beautiful falling water The sky of stars

HAMET
Jefferson knows nothing of this
treaty

EATON

With a fast ship Bashaw he might

HAMET
I would be a puppet The creature
of the United States

EATON
The government of the United States
does not do that sort of thing
HAMET

They will get to it eventually and
I think “eventually” is now The
United States will be a great power
the moment it decides to be Only
the United States is unaware of
this For a navy all that is needed
are men and trees I believe you

have both in abundance

EATON

Mr Jefferson’s thoughts have never

been in that direction

HAMET

Why would I want to be king Mr
Eaton I would live no better than
I do here perhaps worse I would
have more cares I would be in
danger I would endanger my family

EATON

Your brother is not fit I think

you are

HAMET walks away The wind is rising

HAMET

The trouble is not being a king
The trouble is wanting to be

(turns on EATON)

You can’t understand not wanting to

be a king Can you

EATON
Many would not

HAMET
I meant you

EATON says nothing

HAMET

I was not driven away I gave the
throne away The Buddha did it The
prophet Jesus And then someone

came to him in a garden
character of a friend

EATON says nothing staring at Hamez

gently

in the

HAMET finally smiles
EATON takes it from inside his coat and hands it over
sits on a bench and puts his SPE

treaty

HAMET
Ox perhaps you are the devil
Showing me the riches of the world
Its best that you know that I have
no use for them Give me your
treaty

HAMET
(getting to business)

Other nations pay my brother His
piracy is no more than what in what
you would call the civilized world
would be a tax on commerce From
what I understand it is in most
cases less

EATON
The United States are different
(corrects himself)
We are determined to be different

HAMET
If you have commerce you must deal
with the world and you will deal
with it finally as a military
power Your republic will become an
empire Are you the beginning of
that I wonder

EATON wonders himself

HAMET
(smiling)
You are an inevitability in more
ways than one Rehearse me the plan
again

EATON
At Alexandria Bashaw we join with
two hundred United States marines
and a naval detachment with six
eighteen-pounder guns We buy
mercenaries Half the French Army
was abandoned in Egypt there are
soldiers to be had

HAMET
Have you contracted with the
French

HAMET

CTACLES on He reads the

EATON
I came here too rapidly for that
You have a hundred men I have two
hundred and artillery We buy men
in Alexandria We march across
Libya raising revolt where money
can or where you can with or
without money We will be supplied
and reinforced at Derna

HAMET
Derna is garrisoned

EATON
Yet at Derna there will be two
United States heavy frigates We
can take it

CHILDREN’s voices are audible from the hareem

EATON (CONT’D)
Do we go

Wind rises in the garden

HAMET
I do not want the throne But I
must not let my brother have it So
yes Captain Eaton we will go

EATON
Will you sign that document

HAMET
Later Tomorrow perhaps There are
certain things I would change But
we leave for Alexandria tomorrow

EATON bows and crosses the garden one TORCHBEARER going
with him HAMET remains staring out over the gardens towards
the Nile

EXT THE PLAIN OUTSIDE THE BERBER CAMP MORNING

We hear a fusillade of Musket-fire as the Bashaws standard

(a gorgeous green banner) is lifted in the wind The BERBERS
are mounted and excited BATON and HAMET are riding side by

HAMET
The Berber is a great warrior They
will tell you this themselves
repeatedly

EATON
He is a great waster of ammunition

HAMET

Islam took Christian Spain

EATON
That was a long time ago - and
besides they were Spaniards

HAMET
(smiles)
True

EATON wheels his horse and gallops off towards the villa
EXT THE VILLA CONTINUOUS

BERBER camp followers - women and ragged boys are striking
the camp and packing HAMETs belongings Everything proceeds
like lightning EATON canters up and dismounts

EATON nods

EATON brings his horse to water and splashes some in his own
face He coughs then he sits on the edge of the cistern
holding his bridle He takes a cupped hand full of water and
immediately gags and spits it out It is foul He worries
about it for a moment then forgets

RAIS MOHAMED comes riding up
RAIS MOHAMED

I am pleased that we go to war tf

you have misled my master and he

is my master I will kill you
EATON nods
EXT NILE FLOODPLAIN DAY
HAMETS BERBERS are heading north beside the river EATON and

HAMET ride at the front of the column RAIS MOHAMED with them
misses no opportunity to glare at EATON

HAMET
One man one vote I have always
seen a fault in this Some men are
sensible yet most men are stupid
And regardless of his condition
not one man in a thousand has
honor or can even understand it in
others

EATON
If there is a lack of equality in
Nature that is why it must be
devised

HAMET
Then why do you try make me a king

EATON says nothing uncomfortably

RAIS MOHAMED
(glaring at EATON)
For his own purposes

HAMET
This Rais Mohammed is a man of
the age I have a notion that he
may be its spirit Yet he is not
the only one

EATON wonders what this means HAMET smiles at him
EXT THE EGYPTIAN DESERT DAY

THE COLUMN moves Slowly through dust and blinding sunlight
EATON swaying in the saddle examining a map does not look
well He attempts to drink water from a skin -- and retches
HAMET rides alongside

HAMET
Are you ill

EATON
I am well enough

HAMET does not look convinced He stares uneasily after
EATON

EXT THE DESERT CAMP NIGHT LATER

EATON sits by a fire exhausted He has a full growth of
beard He looks il —- exhausted The BERBERS are praying
each man facing east and thudding their heads against the
earth EATON stands and totters weakly away

EATON retches He drops exhausted to the face of

descends It is HAMET carrying a LANTERN EATON
asleep But he wakes at a scuffling noise

HAMET

(looking into EATONs

eyes he seems to have

medical knowledge)
If water is boiled one does not
become ill Call it eccentricity --
many do I always boil my water
when it comes from a dirty place

EATON
One cannot boil a continent

HAMET

My father claimed that tea was a
specific against the cholera He
would drink nothing but tea

(feels EATONs pulse)
But I think it was the water boiled
for tea I have looked through a
microscope It was instructive
There are animals in the water

(covering EATON with his

CLOAK)
The animals in the water are
revealed by a glass With a
different kind of glass one may see
more stars than are seen with the
eye It is the same thing with the
intellect Some men see more than
others do as if they had held up a
glass and their world is
complicated infinitely I am
expected to see one star the
throne But I see others And
brighter And I think 1 had become

EATON
I want your brother dead

HAMET
My brother is not a complicated
man He killed my father and still
tries to kill me to sit on the
disgraced throne of a Turkish
province for which I would not pay
the life of an enemy

EATON
The throne -

HAMET
(spits)
- is dust Don’t you understand
What man who thinks could look at
himself in the mirror if he
defrauded humanity and God if
there is one by posing as a king

EATON
Then why this now

HAMET
(raises his palms in the
hieratic Arab manner)
In challah

EATON
Not likely

HAMET

If all one has is dust then one
perhaps must behowever briefly
its quintessence

(as EATON laughs)
If you think you are more than
other menthere is a thing you
should know One has to be more
than other men even to think it
Unless one is crazy which is
always a possibility Drink

EATON
(drinks and then)
My father thought I was mad when I
went to the Dartmouth College I
was not then and I am not now
Will the people rise when you come
HAMET
Yes They will
(a beat)
I would prefer Paris I have
dreamed of it my whole life There
is no civilization here

EATON
Then make one Isn’t that your job

EATON shivers violently Attempting to stand he collapses
and passes out HAMET goes to him and feels his temperature
and 1 ks into his face

HAMET
Why do you think I came

EXT THE DESERT MOMENTS LATER

BERBERS carrying torches come running over the dunes
followed by HAMET and more BERBERS carrying EATON hanging
limp in their arms HAMET walks after them staring after
EATON

EXT THE DESERT DAY

EATON very ill is riding in a creaking fellaheen cart
HAMET watches him concernedly riding It is a very bad part
of the desert -- they are inland from the floodplain HAMET
is covered in dust RAIS MOHAMED is riding beside HAMET

RAIS MOHAMED
He is dying

HAMET
That would be unfortunate But it
is time for us to go home

RAIS MOHAMED
He has no gold His bags are full
of Spanish silver

HAMET stares at him with princely disinterest

RAIS MOHAMED (CONTD)
He has no gold

RAIS MOHAMED whirls his horse and tides back along the line
HAMET looks at EATON EATON somnolent and covered with
sweat as the cart jolts over the stony ground is obviously
very ill

EXT A FELLAHEEN VILLAGE LATE TWILIGHT

CAMEL-MEAT is boiling in milk The BERBERS are encamped by
millet-fields - exhausted looking around at the strange
place and the beautiful night talking quietly beside the
river

INT A POOR EGYPTIAN HOUSE NIGHT

A TINY FIRE flickers on a flat stone which is the hearth of
the house and tallow candles gutter in the darkness A
woman serves HAMET coffee He raises it in salute not to her -
but to his HOST a toothless and somewhat terrified
villager who gestures “my house is yours and retreats
His wife follows him outside clutching her veil across her
face RAIS MOHAMED drinks noisily HAMET sips coffee and
Looks at EATON EATON very pale and covered with sweat is
sleeping peacefully in the firelight He has been given the
hosts bed -- an Egyptian sleeping platform of reeds EATON
covered with sweat tosses in the bed HAMET watches
carefully in the light of lamps of reeds and tallow RAIS
MOHAMED opens EATON’s writing case and finds

MSS POETRY GOOD DRAWINGS
RAIS MOHAMED looks interestedly at Eaton

HAMET

Put them back

(RAIS MOHAMED does so)
Some men are men of action Others
have to become men of action An
artist who decides that the world
is the real canvas is the man to be
watched

RAIS MOHAMED
You are the Bashaw I will agree
with whatever you wish

HAMET
That’s not my objective Rais
Mohamed

Wind blows around the house Hamet drinks his coffee
thinking

INT EGYPTIAN HOUSE DAWN

HAMET is asleep on the floor We hear a clatter of objects -
a clink of steel HAMET stirs EATON is up on an elbow in
bed his hair disordered bleeding himselZ with a belt
strapped around his left biceps
75

He pierces a vein and unstraps the belt BLOOD squirts into a
pannikin EATON stops the bleeding expertly He is haggard
but he is alive ‘and better He looks up HAMET is awake and
looking at him curiously Rais’Monammec is heard outside
bellowing

EATON
Where are we Bashaw

HAMET
A village An indifferent village

EATON
How long have I been ill

HAMET
We are two days from Alexandria It
has been five days that you could
not ride
(EATON is confused)
You had cholera

EATON
Cholera

HAMET
With cholera you must drink water
with salt No one who does this
dies We forced you to drink

EATON
We must send a man to Alexandria
With a letter for the consul there
We must tell him that we are coming
that I was ill

HAMET
I have done so

EATON
What did you write

HAMET
That you were ill - that I prayed
you would recover — and that I (of
course with you) was two days from
Alexandria I am not an idiot I am
a king should I choose to be
(EATON chastened looks
at HAMET who dresses)
You will not get well if you stick
knives in yourself
(MORE)

HAMET (contd)
Bleeding is only good for fat red
men with too much blood whose
hearts would burst otherwise

EATON stares -- realizing that this makes excellent sense

HAMET (CONTD)
I thought that you would die And I
was sorry

EATON
(reaching for his coat)
I had the most disordered dreams

HAMET
Did you dream of glory

EATON
What else is there

HAMET
Wives and children and peace You
know these things exist Do not
forget them

HAMET goes out EATON chastened buttons his coat and arms
himself

EXT ARAB HOUSE DAY

EATON looking very weak steps out into the blinding
sunlight He is immediately disconcerted by smiling BERBERS
Hamets men look genuinely pleased that he is well RAIS
MOHAMED rides up with EATONS HORSE

RAIS MOHAMED
(still not absolutely sure
about Eaton)
I am pleased that you did not die

EATON gratefully takes the bridle HAMET rides up He pulls
out a purse -- and tosses it to the HOST in the doorway of

his hovel

HOST

God will reward you
HAMET

La
EATON

You don’t believe in God

HME looks at him
HAMET
Dubiety occurs even in Islam If
the wind is northerly originality
is possible I want to tell you
something You must not laugh

EATON
What is it

HAMET
I do not want the throne but I am
for Tripoli I am either a paradox
ox I have something on my mind I
do have something and it is best
that you know

EATON
(standing looking up at
HAMET)
What is it

HAMET
We are forming a republic at
Tripoli and I am going to free the
slaves

FATON stares at him in disbelief

HAMET
That is why I came

HAMET spurs off EATON mounts precariously but he manages
He is joyous

RAIS MOHAMED
(leaning over in saddle
suspiciously)
What is a republic

EATON
Your king Rais Mohamed most
unexpectedly intends to make you
free What do you make of that

RAIS MOHAMED
What will he do

EATON
Go down in history

EATON rides up beside HAMET

HAMET
So we begin

EATON
We begin

EXT A RUINED VILLAGE OUTSIDE ALEXANDRIA DAY

THE UNITED STATES FLAG flies in the desert air Two brass
FIELD GUNS lie under tarpaulins which snap in the breeze

OBANNON He stares towards the desert with (for OBANNON)
obvious unease MARINES stand around a rocky yard of a ruined
house

OBANNONS POV

The hillside above the village is covered with picketed
horses and camels black nomad tents and about five hundred
TUAREG WARRIORS tattooed savages in blue robes sitting
stonily on the ground and staring down at the American camp

OBANNON is joined by his SERGEANT

©’ BANNON
(staring towards Tuaregs)
Give them the rest of the sheep

SERGEANT
Why dont we give them the
barrelled beef sir

O’ BANNON
Because its pork

SERGEANT
It is

O BANNON
It was

A SOLITARY RIDER comes down the hill He is CAID ABDEL -- a
very fierce and ignorant Tuareg nomad OBANNON watches him
come and steps forward MARINES -- there are only twenty of
them -- stand watchfully around the compound CAID ABDEL
reins in in a cloud of dust and starts shouting in fierce
Arabic ( Whenever EATON is not present Arabic is Arabic )
He rides in circles shouting -- obviously making some sort
of bitter case

O BANNON
‘I agree sir Pleasant weather
“79

CAID ABDEL rides rapidly up the hill cloak flying O BANNON
turns looking intensely worried - but not without humor
Tae sergeant looks at him and falls in beside him

OBANNON (CONTD)
Cartridge kegs to be opened inside
the house Reloaders to be
appointed every fifth man

SERGEANT
Then what

O BANNON
Rum The Tuareg dont want the rum
at least Imagine them drunk

PARKER looking very ill stands in his shirt-sleeves in a
ruined doorway staring towards the Tuaregs He has
obviously just got up from a bed and a bad spell

OBANNON (CONTD)
Get yourself to bed Mr Parker we
dont need a dead officer of
artillery

PARKER
(buttoning his uniform
coat)

I’m all right

O BANNON
Then you might unlimber your guns
and double-charge with canister
PARKER
(staring towards the
Tauregs )
Right
EXT THE DESERT DAY
The BERBER column is riding and making good time

A GALLOPER approaches from the opposite direction EATON
raises his telescope

THE GALLOPER is a European in civilian clothes
EATON has a premonition that something is wrong He glances
towards HAMET beside him HAMET may have something of a

premonition as well

As the European rider reins in He is an American very
young His name is Baxter

BAXTER
William Eaton The naval agent

EATON nods BAXTER wheels his horse in beside EATONs They
ride together

BAXTER
(looks towards BERBERS)
Youve got the Bashaw

EATON
one of us has got the other

BAXTER
I am secretary to Captain
MacCarney the Alexandria consul
Theres trouble sir

EATON
Explain

BAXTER
There has been in Alexandria for
some time a tribe of Libyan Tuareg
who were mercenaries in Napoleons
campaign They’ve been there since
the French the officers anyway
decamped Consul McCarney thought
that it would be in your interest
to employ them

EATON
Why is the Alexandria consul hiring
my mercenaries

BAXTER
I dont know

EATON
He wanted to be “helpful” I
imagine

BAXTER
Helpful yes sir Anyway sir he
sent them -- they number about five
hundred -- to the marine camp

outside Alexandria This was two
WEES ago

(MORE)

BAXTER (contd)
The trouble is they havent been
paid and they are more or less
laying siege to the camp

EATON
Has there been fighting

BAXTER
Its on the verge of it

EATON
The Tuareg shouldnt have been
hired but since they were why
havent they been paid

BAXTER
Well your guns were landed from a
sloop of war last week with
sailors and an officer named Parker
-- who I think is ill --

EATON
What about the gold

BAXTER

No goldthat is so far as 1
know I know very little Ima
secretary sir

EATON
Secretaries are the only men who
know anything
(BAXTER looks unhappy)
When is it coming

BAXTER
(a long and painful pause)
Commodore Prebles been replaced
sir

EATON has no idea what to think or say He stares at Baxter

BAXTER
Commodore Barron does not so much
approve of your plan Between you
and me just what I hear its not
that your plan is not good its
because its too good The man who
takes Tripoli is - well Obviously
He will be the man who takes
Tripoli

EATON
They don’t know the half of it
BAXTER’
The Consitl wishes me to extend his
apologies ior going off at halt
cock and hiring the Tuareg

EATON
(furious)
He didnt hire the Tuareg He
promised gold to five hundred
brigands and he doesnt have it I
dont have it How many marines has
OBannon got ashore now-

BAXTER
The preliminary force he was landed
with sir to establish your camp

EATON
That was twenty men Mr Baxter
BAXTER
Twenty men sir yes
EATON
Where are the rest
BAXTER
Not landed
EATON

You ride back to Alexandria and
you tell McCarney that I need gold
I dont care where he gets it He
can stuff dirt up his ass and jump
around until it turns to gold

But I want gold at OBannon’s camp
by the time I arrive oF Iam not
responsible Am I plain

BAXTER
(wide-eyed)
Assuredly

EATON
Is there even a naval vessel at
Alexandria

BAXTER
No

EATON
Thank you If you are not over the
horizon in five minutes i wiil
ride you down and cut off your
head

Baxter terrified spurs off EATON rides along shattered
thinking furiously HAMET approaches from behind and falls
in at a walk beside EATON HAMETs glance flicks towards the
departing assistant consul Then he looks at EATON

EATON (CONTD)
We must make better time Bashaw

HAMET looks at him

HAMET
Trouble

RAIS MOHAMED stares at EATON

EATON

EXT CAMP OUTSIDE ALEXANDRIA DAWN

The TUAREGS are still encamped on the surrounding hills
staring down at OBannon’s camp

the dried mud and begins to enlarge a loophole

OBANNON stares at the Tuareg He has been up all night He
walks along a line of men PARKER in naval uniform stands
by a gun on a rooftop watching the Tuaregs

TUAREGS silhouetted against the lightening east sit and
quietly watch the American camp

EXT THE CAMP AT ALEXANDRIA NOON

OBANNON arms folded leans against the parapet of a roof A
MARINE is drowsing -- not asleep but in a trance state

Damn the men He better have their

wages
EXT BEFORE THE CAMP AT ALEXANDRIA MORNING

The BERBER column flying the Bashaws banner rides in
between the Tuaregs and the MARINES EATON stares
apprehensively towards the hillside So does HAMET

THEIR POV

TUAREG warriors stand on rock outcrops Some of them are
armed with crossbows They are primitive terrifying

HAMET
(drily)
The Blue People An excellent
decision

EATON
Id better see whats going on
Dismount your men Bashaw

HAMET

Between the Tuareg and your camp
I think

EATON
(nervously)
Wherever you like Bashaw

HAMET
I think between the Tuareg and your
camp

EATON rides up to the camp MARINES roll aside a CART which
has blocked a gap in the wall

EXT THE HILL ABOVE THE ALEXANDRIA CAMP DAY
TAUREGS talk excitedly among themselves (as excited as

Tuaregs get which isnt very) watching the development of
events CAID ABDEL spits

EXT THE CAMP AT ALEXANDRIA

OBANNON comes forward across the dusty yard EATON reins in
and dismounts surveying the defensive situation -- the
Tuaregs on the hill

OBANNON
Still here sir All twenty seven
of us As you see Parker landed
with two guns and six sailors to
fire them -- but thats all

EATON
Parker Is he well

O BANNON
Hed tell you something different
than I would I think he is
actually dead sir yet will not
lie down

EATON
Good for him There should be more
of it Did the consul come with
gold

O BANNON

Had his eminence the fucking consul
shown up with fucking gold sir my
men would not be cutting fucking
loopholes and Mr Parker would not
be triple loaded with fucking
canister on the fucking roof Sir

(EATON looks uneasily

towards the Tuaregs He

has absolutely no idea

what to do)
Commodore Barron wants Tripoli
Were to proceed if you see fit to
proceed -- but with only what we
have

EATON
He is pledged to supply us

OBANNON

If we are at Derna on schedule
there will be a frigate there
which will land marines gold and
more artillery

(hands Eaton a LETTER)
They say If were not at Derna
shell sail away
Maes 86

EATON
(explodes)
There is no way to deal with these
people without goid

oO BANNON
Perhaps your friend can call a
jihad

EATON looks mentally wrecked There is the jingle of harness
and the sound of horse-hooves EATON looks around HAMET
Bashaw sits his horse in the gateway

HAMET
These Tuareg have not been paid It
is making them unpleasant

EATON
(placatingly)
The Tuaregs will have to be deait
with All we were supposed to have
here Bashaw it seems we will have
in Derna instead I will get gold
I must go to Alexandria

HAMET sits his horse considering things There is a
prolonged silence EATON swallows hard and watches him

HAMET
I will pay the Tuareg

EATON
That is not what is laid down in
the treaty

HAMET
I haven’t signed it

HAMET points with his stick BERBERS unstrap a box from a
mile Gold shifts heavily inside

HAMET (CONTD)
We cannot pay them everything but
I will give them something so that
they will not kill us

EATON
Then by all means
(HAMET rides off smiling
wrily Eason turns to
OBANNON) -
Keep order here and bring the
Berbers inside the lines

EATON (contd)

sixties wearing an outdated wig comes along through the
crowd with a throng of servants (they have been shopping) and
his assistant Baxter Consul McCARNEY stops and stares
MCCARNEYS POV POV

BATON sunburnt and covered with dust sits on the front
step of the consulate

BAXTER whispers to MCCARNEY -- who strides forward

MCCARNEY
Well well Eaton
EATON
Whats left of him
MCCARNEY
(As servant takes out door

key)
All going well

EATON
You nearly had my men massacred

MCCARNEY
Your idea is nonsensical in the
first place Preble was an
impetuous officer -- not sound

EATON
He had a job not a position
ise
en

MCCARNEY
He has been replaced The new
Commodore has no time for this
juggling of indistinguishable
despots

EATON
The despots are far from
indistinguishable and I need money

MCCARNEY
Write to Washington sir like the
rest of us See the Commodore

EATON
Uniess he has gone to see Vesuvius
the Commodore is blockading
Tripoli

MCCARNEY
Well If you go to Tripoli perhaps
youll see him there

EATON
You hired the Tuaregs sir They
are at my camp but on your
promises What if I told them that
you refused to pay

MCCARNEY
(alarmed)
Rubbish
EATON

Rubbish sir is what would be left
of this consulate Are you in
possession of orders telling me not
to march on Tripoli Has Barron
actually countermanded Prebles
orders

MCCARNEY
-No But his antipathy is plain
And thats enough

EATON
And based on his own desire to take
Tripoli

MCCARNEY

What are your ambitions based on
sir An abiding love for North
Airicans
EATON
Men like you crawl into your places
and you rejoice when a man goes
down It’s the way of the world
But I’m not having it Not this
time The United States is pledged
to support Hamet

McCARNEY says nothing He is angry but also ashamed

MCCARNEY
Youll dine with me well talk it
out
EATON

Theres nothing to talk about I am
going for Tripoli I need gold As
much as youve got or can get -
right now sir -- for the Tuaregs
you hired Or I will tell them
where to find you sir and god
help you in that case

MCCARNEY
Do you call yourself a gentleman
This is simple extortion You are
threatening me sir

EATON

I am I need money You may write a
draft on the United States You may
seize an American cargo You may
even take a bribe from the Turk as
Alexandria consuls have been known
to do --

(McCARNEY looks up

nervously)
But I will have gold You put me in
a bad position sir but you put
yourself in a worse one Make no
mistake I will dismiss the Tuareg
I will open on them with fucking
artillery and I will give them
your address

MCCARNEY
I can get you five thousand dollars
in gold Perhaps more

EATON
I thought you could
MCCARNEY
(grabbing paper and pen)
Its naval money

EATON
Until I see otherwise in writing I
am the Naval Agent to the Barbary
States

MCCARNEY
I must report these circumstances

EATON
You may do as you like

EXT THE TUAREG CAMP OUTSIDE ALEXANDRIA NIGHT

As GOLD COINS spill in firelight onto a rug A TUAREG
looking nearly feverish with greed separates the coins into
piles of ten TUAREGS crowd closer They are Saharan
Hamitic men -- far from home EATON looks around disguising
his anxiety CAID ABDEL looks contented He has a
psychopathic and stylized Tuareg fierceness which is the
frame of every subordinate expression His face is scarified
his eyelids are dyed (The Tuaregs are Hamitic-speaking
people -- but Caid Abdel knows Arabic)

CAID ABDEL
(fiercely)
It is sufficient

TUAREGS crowd closer murmuring respectfully

EATON
You will ask no more than this and
five cartridges per man until
Tripoli There will be no thieving
either

CAID ABDEL says nothing

CAID ABDEL stares at him EATON looks around at the sea of
fierce blue-veiled men

EXT ABOVE THE CAMP LATER

EATON comes down from the firelit Tuareg camp and joins
PARKER and OBANNON They fall in together walking towards
the camp

O BANNON
A charmer as Isaid

EATON
Installing a king is a lucrative
endeavor They cant mistake that

O BANNON
What do we get

EATON
I thought glory was the end of it
but it isn’t

O’ BANNON
What are you saying about a

coffee from a tin mug and watches them go

EATON
I assume that Rais Mohamed will be
discreet as he rides ahead

HAMET
Mohamed is not a fool He does not
want my brother killing villagers
He will go to Derna look at it
and come back

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE CAMP MORNING

OBANNON is inspecting his MARINES They are in full
uniform at attention with packs PARKER with his SAILORS
and handful of ragged EGYPTIAN PORTERS are backing mules into
the cassion-traces PARKER is ill -- very pale with a
tubercular sweat He sees Eaton comingand prevents himself
from coughing

EATON
(mounted)
How is your health Mr Parker
PARKER
I can march

EATON
Ride

PARKER

I went to sea when I was nine I am
terrified of horses And I had no
idea sir that mules were so
objectionable

EATON
Ride on one of the carts if you get
tired
(EATON walks on and then
thinking of something
turns)
Mr Parker

PARKER
(after a moment)
Two of my men are master gunners
if that answers your concern

EATON
(a beat)
The water carts are in your charge

EATON goes PARKER busies himself with work but he is very
ill and for a moment appears not sure that he is doing the
right thing with the last days of his life

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE CAMP CONTINUOUS
EATON mounted rides out among the BERBERS HAMET joins him
They ride through the TUAREG looking at them A more
disreputable set of men could not be imagined They come
among the BERBERS

The DRUMMER beats assembly EATON rides uncertainly through
the Tuaregs

EXT THE CAMP

VARIOUS SHOTS as the column forms Two BERBERS riders hoist
the BASHAWS STANDARDS and then THE AMERICAN FLAG at the
head of the column EATON rides up beside HAMET (HAMET is
wearing European clothes at no point does he dress as a
Berber)

EATON
(to himself)

RAMET slyly looks at him
HAMET
The banners of the king advance

Do you mean me or you

EATON
Youre an unusual man

HAMET
(looking at EATON
intently)
Why bother with the other thing

EATON slowly smiles This is what he said in the Bashaws
ante-room

EATON
I didn’t come out of the blue You

lathered mules The MARINES are marching stolidly muskets at
sling arms OBANNON with them on foot HAMET Bashaw rides
with Caid Abdel talking animatedly in Arabic They are at a
distance We cannot hear HAMET looks nervous He makes a
salaam and spurs forward towards the head of the column
EATON has seen the two men talking

EATON
What says the Caid this time

HAMET
He says that we are slow that he
would prefer to ride ahead and
meet us at the next water or
before Derna

EATON
So he can raid So he can sell us
to your brother take payment from
both sides and fight for none

HAMET
His mind is not a noble device but
this last idea has appeared in it

At the next water he will ask for
more cartridges Do not give him

EATON and HAMET ride up The flies are heard buzzing
HAMET slides from the saddle and stares at his friend
©’ BANNON comes up He peers

O’ BANNON’S POV

An arabic word is carved into RAIS MOHAMED’S CHEST

O’ BANNON
What does that say

EATON
“Tripoli”

TUAREGS charge down into the southern outskirts of the
village firing They dismount and capture SHEEP and
VILLAGERS

EATON is now staring ahead sharply

EATON
Form before the fort
EXT VILLAGE CONTINUOUS

TUAREGS drive villagers and sheep through a dyeing-yard of
billowing cloth Among them is an Arab girl the first woman
closely seen so far in the film She is shrieking A Taureg
has her by the wrist and is dragging her along as he rides
Other Tuaregs have also captured women A shepherd boy is
being driven by horses and laughing Tuaregs He is trying to
defend some old women who are wailing A Tuareg kills him

with a lance
EXT VILLAGE WELLS MOMENTS LATER

EATON and OBANNON watch standing by the wells before the
fort Tuaregs are smashing apart the dyeing yards EATON is
exhausted -- perhaps ill again -- and for a moment he is
inclined to let it go Then he steels himself

HAMET is standing apprehensively with his men

A TUAREG dismounts and drags shrieking BERBER girl towards a
hovel

EATON starts forward grabs the man and clubs him senseless
with a PISTOL The girl stares at EATON A second TUAREG come
running towards EATON with a drawn sword

HAMET
No

EATON cocks shoots the TUAREG in the head THe man falls
bonelessly

HAMET (CONTD)
We will be massacred

EATON
Mr Parker Bring your guns to
bear Mr OBannon Your people
will stand to arms and prepare to
hold this ground If we must
withdraw we will retire into the
fort

HAMET runs towards CAID ABDEL

EXT THE VILLAGE CONTINUOUS

TUAREGS are looting More women have been discovered hiding
and are being dragged out of a grain-pit They are shattered

They were raped previously by the Bashaws troops Tuaregs
are firing muskets and jezzails into the air

EXT BEFORE THE FORT CONTINUOUS

PARKER watches critically standing ready by his guns He
blows out the flashpan of a pistol and reprimes

EATON
Mr Parker put a ball over the
heads of the Tuaregs and then
double charge with cannister
(shouting)
Marines will form firing lines
flanking the guns

O’BANNON is amazed but he does what he is supposed to do

OBANNON
(to MARINES)
You will load firelocks fix
bayonets and prepare to defend the
guns as we retire into the fort

TUAREGS are beginning to notice the activity around the guns
HAMET breaks away and pelts across towards his BERBERS

EATON
Hamet Two groups flanking the
marines keep them mounted On my
signal charge to clear the
village

HAMET nods and rides away He looks dazed a man where he
does not want to be

EATON (CONTD)
to PARKER
You remember what I said
(PARKER nods)
Fire

PARKER pulls a lanyard the FLINTLOCK strikes and the gun
booms tremendously HORSES rear and TUAREGS run everywhere
Instantaneous shouting and panic CAID ABDEL astonished
looks around

THE CAIDS POV

EATONs battle line two guns leveled and the MARINES in a
thin line HAMETs BERBERS massed on either side It looks
organized and formidable and it is BERBERS draw swords
EATON walks forward alone and stands twenty yards before the
GUNS a PISTOL in his hand

TUAREGS leap upon their horses CAID ABDEL is defiant on a
restive horse His men crowd up behind him

EATON crosses the dusty ground towards him

EATON

PARKERS SAILORS load the fired GUN with GRAPESHOT -- A lot
of it and then CHAIN
CAID ABDEL
I will do as I like We are too

EATON
I will open on you with the guns
CAID ABDEL
Give us cartridges and we will go
EATON
Take your people away from this
village
CAID ABDEL

We are too many He
(indicates HAMET with
riding stick)
is not the Bashaw Where are his
people He is an infidel
(spits)
With others

EATON
Your people will retire or I will
open on them with guns Caid

CAID
No

As TUAREGS aim weapons at EATON EATON cocks and levels a
pistol holding it directly on Caid Abdel He is shaking The
CAID sees that EATON is shaking and smiles

EATON
Withdraw your men

The Caid spits MORE TUAREGS arm themselves TUAREGS are
massing in the village square

O BANNON
(shouts)
Eaton

Perhaps a hundred TUAREGS now aim weapons at EATON but EATON
is in a fury He keeps the pistol aimed at the CAID whose
horse is restive

EATON
T will not say it again Withdraw
your men

CAID ABDEL

I like this village I will not go
I have no place to go You cannot
shoot me Look at these

(a HUNDRED TUAREGS are

aiming at Eaton)
Give us cartridges

EATON fires CAID ABDEL head-shot pitches from his horse
instantly dead

OBANNON
Eaton Down

EATON throws himself flat

PARKER
Fire

THE GUNS fire at once over Eaton and the grapeshot and chain
lashes into the Tuaregs at point-blank range Perhaps a
hundred horses go down and as many men The whole area is
suddenly red with blood and there is instantaneously
tremendous firing EATON gets to his feet and runs through
the smoke It is black powder smoke tremendously thick
Figures in it are shadows There is fighting everywhere- but
the Tuaregs are broken and mainly trying to escape Horses
and men are screaming EATON gains the GUNS The Tuaregs are
milling in chaos The TUAREGS charge THE GUNS fire again
(simultaneous with a Marine volley) and destroy fifty
riders A MARINE falls shot through the throat and EATON
catches him in his arms

EATON
Hamet your people will charge

HAMETS BERBERS charge into the TUAREG SURVIVORS who run and
ridein every direction Some BERBERS die
EXT THE HILLS ABOVE THE VILLAGE MOMENTS LATER

As the TUAREGS leaderless attempt to form the Fifty
DETACHED BERBERS dismounted rise from the rocks and open
fire on the TUAREG The TUAREG without powder losing more
men gallop away

EXT BEFORE THE FORT CONTINUOUS

EATON and PARKER powder-blackened stare dumbly off through
the smoke

EATON
Well hold the fort in case they
come back Get everyone inside

EATON walks toward the WELLS
EXT VILLAGE WELLS

EATON splashes water in his facefrom a stone basin apart
from the well and looks as if his nerves will get the better
of him Then he again washes -- as HAMET approaches across
the stony yard He sits down on the edge of the well

HAMET
I have eight dead

EATON
Im sorry

HAMET
My people have been to the villages
inland There are no villagers to
raise for they have been taken
away My brother knows we are
coming He has killed a tenth and
taken the rest to Benghazi as
levies

EATON
I want scouts sent ahead to
Tripoli To return with news of the
blockade They can meet us behind
Derna

HAMET
The rumor here - among all the
people - is that we come with a
large army My brother believes we
have ten thousand men He is coming
out from Tripoli to fight us

(MORE)

HAMET (contd)
Who would say that we have ten
thousand men

EATON splashes water in his face again instead of answering
he is exhausted WATERING HORSES push him out of the way

HAMET
(very angry)

With a rumor one must ask to whom
is it useful We draw troops away
from Tripoli

EATON
If we are a rumor Hamet Bashaw
this rumor will be at Derna in two
days and the Commodore will keep
the Navys bargain

EATON drops the bucket into the well

HAMET
There will be no ships

EATON stares at him He knows it too

HAMET
I am going back to Egypt

HAMET walks away EATON stares after him and then sits down
on the broken stones by the WELL

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE VILLAGE MOMENTS LATER
HAMET looks at his DEAD

ON SOUND we hear VILLAGE WOMEN wailing

HAMET stops and looks

VILLAGE WOMEN having emerged from hiding are wailing over
the BODIES of the men slaughtered in the ditches

HAMET stares

HAMET
Pay the women Have them see to the

dead

He goes off

INT ARAB VILLAGE GRANARY NIGHT
A dust storm is rising around the crumbled building

Eaton wrapped in a blanket is staring into firelight and
absently sipping coffee We hear Parkercoughing not far
away OBannon stands looking out through a hole in the mud
wall oe

Hamet is doctoring Parker with a plaster on his back
Parker trying to catch his breath is breathing steam from a
pot Parker coughs -- and catches a gout of blood on the back
of his hand He stares at it expressionlessly as it
trickles down his arm Then at the sound of footsteps he
looks up

OBannon stands above him watching Parker says nothing and
does not move to wipe away the blood OBannon after a
moment nods -- and walks away

Hamet uncorks a bottle of opium

PARKER
Thank you no No opium

HAMET
You are dying

Parker says nothing but his eyes fill with tears

PARKER
Yes

Hamet after a moment corks the bottle

HAMET

You were splendid with the guns
PARKER

Imagine what I might have done had

IT lived
HAMET after a moment corks the bottle
INT VILLAGE GRANARY NIGHT

EATON his back to the wall is sitting thinking OBannon
is nearby

O BANNON
I say we destroy the guns and mount
the marines and get out of here
That is my advice

‘Eaton says nothing
O’BANNON goes out into the storm

Eaton stares into space The wind is rising and dust is
starting to blow about in the air The khamsin winds A view
through the broken granary walls as the khamsin settles in

EXT THE VILLAGE MORNING

THE dust-storm is at full force Berbers are pulling cloth
over the eyes of their horses The sound of wind and the
slashing of sand is very loud The sky has gone violet
Marines and sailors are huddled in the lees of buildings The
bodies of Tuaregs are being covered in dust

EXT THE VILLAGE MORNING
PARKER is directing the cleaning of the guns He notices
HAMET coming out of the house where he has slept

CHILDREN run up to him and kneel Some OLD PEOPLE stare from
doorways HAMET does not move Then as if he is touching
flame he puts his hand on the head of a BOY

HAMET
We must see how much food is left
and how it may be apportioned
(not wanting to ask)
Do you know who I am

BOY
You are the king

HAMET turns and looks at PARKER He nods at him
PARKER nods back gravely
EXT VILLAGE WELLS LATER

EATON is sitting brokenly on the stones HAMET comes up to
him HAMET for the first time in the film is dressed in
Berber clothing and wears a sword EATON stares at him

HAMET
My brother’s army is coming We are
going to die Probably like Rais
Mohamed But we will go as far as
we can and do as much as we can
before we do

EXT THE LIBYAN DESERT DAY

The storm has passed but there are signs of it -- scoured
dunes half-buried shrubs and driited outcrops of rock The
column now reduced to the Berbers the guns and the
marines proceeds at the walk th two guns at the rear

The MARINES are in terrible shape

PARKER not well is staggering through the dust -- but
forcing himself on

A WATER-CART TOPPLES AND THE BARREL-RESERVOIR BREAKS OPEN
EXT THE LIBYAN DESERT CONTINUOUS

Eaton rides forward through the wind far ahead of the
column wearing a Berber headcloth

LONG SHOT

Tripolitan lancers are briefly visible inland A party of
men riding along a ridge-line and then vanishing

Eaton stares at them until they are gone He turns back
towards the column forcing his horse through the terrible
wind

EXT A ROCKY PART OF THE DESERT NIGHT

The column is still marching The wind is high and dust is
blowing

EATON
(shouting over the wind)
Lancers

EATON points

Hamet wheels his horse and gives orders to BERBERS Five
BERBERS thunder off through the storm chasing the scouts

HAMET
We go inland tomorrow Into the
Djebel Akdar To come out above
Derna We will see if your warships
are there

EATON
They will be there

EXT ABOVE DERNA DAWN

THE COLUMN has halted in a stony valley EATON and HAMET
clothes fluttering in the wind climb a rocky hill

CRANE UP WITH THEM TO REVEAL
THE TOWN OF DERNA

It is a tiny walled town -- domed and spired -- textbook
North Africa built in an oasis by a green wadi above the
sea Separate from the town are quays commanded by a
ruined fort

EXT THE RIDGE ABOVE DERNA CONTINUOUS

EATON incredibly sunburnt his lips cracked and his face
covered with dust opens his telescope

TELESCOPE POV

THE TRIPOLITAN FLAG flies above the town Tilting down we
see that there are sentries at the walls —- bored men
standing about slapping at flies There are cannon -- and the
tents of soldiers before the East wall

TELESCOPE PANS
HORSES ARE PICKETED AMONG DATE PALMS MORE SOLDIERS
TELESCOPE PANS

Fishermen are mending nets Seabirds fly There is a ruined
castle (called a bourdj) by the quay There are no warships —
- or any ships offshore

EATON lowers the telescope His emotions are concealed HAMET
stares at him EATON takes a moment to speak

EATON
(hands TELESCOPE to Hamet)
The town is heavily garrisoned
There are no warships

EATON gets up and starts off down the hill towards the
army which is hidden in the valley near a tumble-down
village and a well

EATON (CONTD)
(turning)
It is early in the day
He goes on HAMET watches and then puts the TELESCOPE to his
eye and looks down at Derna

TELESCOPE POV (HAMET)

TWO FLAGS fly above the roof of the palace One is the
standard of Yusuf The other -—-

appears as HAMET lowers the glass to be significant only to
Hamet He snaps the glass shut

EXT THE BIVOUAC ABOVE DERNA

ARTILLERY MULES are watering at a small stream OBANNON his
face blistered stands watching as EATON picks his way
towards the camp over the rough ground

EATON

The walls are a shambles On the
East theyve fallen down
completely

(as OBANNON stares at him

bleakly)
There are about two thousand
regulars in the town Seven heavy
guns some swivels on the walls No
cavalry that I can see Not that it
isnt nearby It’s been shadowing
us

OBANNON
And the frigates

EATON
Not here

PARKER looking if anything more ill than before is sitting
in the shade of a caisson and drinking water -- and
composing a letter At the sound of hoofbeats he looks up

PARKERS POV

BERBER GALLOPERS galloper come down the inland slope of the
valley

EATON has heard as well he shades his eyes

EATON (CONTD)
The scouts

HAMET leaps down from the hill and strides towards the scouts
as they come riding into the camp

EXT THE BIVOUAC ABOVE DERNA

The scouts rein in dismount and stand talking passionately
to HAMET EATON stands back watching HAMET looks towards
EATON and then comes across the stony ground

HAMET
(to EATON)
Walk apart with me

EATON does so worriedly but maintaining like HAMET a dead-
pan expression as they pass through the staring BERBERS

HAMET (CONTD)
They could not get to Tripoli They
did not get past Benghazi There
was cavalry everywhere Yusufs
army has come out It is coming
here

EATON
Tripoli Bashaw

HAMET
It has been assaulted by gunboats
but not taken

EATON
Good

HAMET
Good Your country has made no
progress and you say good

EATON
What I mean- in your interest —
should be ‘clear

HAMET
Do you mean perhaps that you will ©
have nothing if someone else takes
Tripoli

EATON
I mean precisely that your people
will have nothing

HAMET smiles
HAMET
A force of five thousand men - what
you would call regulars - though I
doubt they are regular in much at
all - is marching here They will
be here by tomorrow Cavalry and
horse-artillery will be here at any
time

EATON
If Tripoli is under assault why
are Yusufs regulars out

HAMET
(looks duplicitous for a
moment then shrugs)
My brother is in Derna

EATON
He’s here

HAMET
He’s here
(changing subject)
There are no frigates and an army
is coming

EATON
Then we have to pick defensible
ground Bashaw and hold it until
the frigates come

HAMET
And what if these warships do not
come
EATON
We die

Hamet walks a little apart He stares at the dust

EATON
The warships will be here

HAMET
Stop saying that

EATON sits down completely done

EATON
What do we do Bashaw
Hamet turns and looks at Eaton for a long moment O BANNON
comes up

HAMET

It is impossible to take the town
We agree that it is impossible to
take the town

O’ BANNON
With what we have yes Bashaw It
is impossible to take Derna We
cannot make an assault on any
defended place

HAMET
(pointing at Eaton)
I want to hear him say it

It is impossible to take the town
The ships will not come We’re

finished

town

OBANNON and MARINES come up OBANNON is staring around at
CIVILIANS pouring into the streets and acclaiming the
bashaw OBANNON sees EATON

EATON
This is what the world is when you
don’t listen to anybody

OQ’ BANNON bows
DERNESE CIVILIANS are rioting with joy HAMET has climbed the
steps of the palace He raises his hand The crowd begins to

shout Hamet Hamet Hamet

EATON goes to the fountain A dead man lies in it but the
water runs ciear He drinks

EATON
Yusuf was here He got out Hell
be back with his army We have to
oxganize a defense

With what

ON SOUND quieting the CHEERING there is a double thump of
distant artillery and a crackle of musketry

EATON looks wildly around

EATON
Parker

EXT A RIDGE ABOVE DERNA CONTINUOUS

DEAD TRIPOLITAN LANCERS and horses just knocked down are
scattered all over the stony ground More TRIPOLITAN LANCERS
are charging up the ridge through the smoke

PARKER
FIRE

Half the TRIPOLITAN LANCERS are blown off their horses An
animation effect would increase the look of the impact of
grapeshot

More TRIPOLITAN LANCERS ride out of a date grove and ride
towards them up from the sea

PARKER (CONTD)
Stand where you are

EGYPTIAN PORTERS throw down their weapons and run into the
broken ground PARKER notes this there is nothing to be done
-- the TRIPOLITAN LANCERS are on them

PARKER falls back and levels a PISTOL He fires and a man
goes down The surviving TRIPOLITAN LANCERS spur among the
guns Somz arz shot or knocked off their horses by SAILORS
PARKER draws cocks and fires the other Then he draws his
sword A LANCER rides at him through the smoke PARKER
parries the lance with two-handed blow as the horse passes
The LANCER wheels the sun behind him spurs forward PARKER
attempts to parry again but the LANCE goes through his
shoulder breaking off and the horse rides him down

PARKER slams down into the dust The confusion is abstract
around him He begins to get up trying to support himself on
a gun wheel and is shot through the body An unhorsed LANCER
comes at him with a scimitar raised
PARKER sees him struggles upright and lunges He stabs the
LANCER through the neck and falls across the man he has
killed SAILORS attempting to spike the guns are cut down

by TRIPOLITAN LANCERS Clouds of dust blow across the scene

on the ridge PARKER drags himself to his feet but falls

and sits in the dust his back against a gun-wheel He sees —
— more TRIPOLITAN LANCERS riding towards the artillery
position SAILORS run away leaving PARKER alone

PARKER (CONTD)
(weakly)
Right

PARKER gets himself upright and haggardly looks up He is
coughing blood He realizes that there are TRIPOLITAN LANCERS
surrounding him He turns slowly PARKER sees a lancer
officer It is JOUBERT Covering him with a pistol

JOUBERT
Je vous ferai quartier si vous le
souhaitez

PARKER squinting in sunlight weeping with pain figures out
the French

PARKER
Ce ne sera pas necessaire

PARKER after an interval is torn apart by a volley of
shots He pitches into the blowing dust JOUBERT after a
beat looks towards the town

JOUBERTS POV

THE UNITED STATES FLAG and HAMETs standard rise above the
town BERBERS and townspeople are pouring out of the gates
and BERBERS are riding towards him

JOUBERT appraising the whole scene then notices something
else He squints seaward -- and then opens a telescope

JOUBERTS TELESCOPE POV

A UNITED STATES FRIGATE is standing in towards the harbor As
we watch her gigantic battle flag is run up the jackstaff

JOUBERT lowers the telescope He snaps it shut

EXT THE RUINED FORT MOMENTS LATER

TRIPOLITAN LANCERS ride through the gate and dismount taking
defensive positions as people pour towards them from the
town firing JOUBERT dismounting doesnt like his chances -
- but they are his chances He stares through the ruined
wall

TRIPOLITAN SOLDIERS and HAMETS BERBERS are among the
attackers pouring out of the town and firing at the lancers

JOUBERT begins to direct fire A LANCER begins to protest He
puts down his musket

LANCER
Hamet Bashaw

JOUBERT off-handedly shoots the man Then turns The other
TRIPOLITAN LANCERS begin to fire at the approaching mob Then-
JOUBERT raises a hand -- the firing stops

JOUBERTS POV

EATON is riding forward with a white cloth bunched in his
hand

EXT BEFORE THE RUINED FORT DAY

EATON rides forward Behind him are the mounted BERBERS --
fanning out in a crescent -- and then hundreds of civilians
and TRIPOLITAN soldiers

JOUBERT appears coolly in the gate The two men meet each
other in the blowing dust

EATON
The town is taken sir It has
risen against Yusuf

JOUBERT
These towns do not rise very far
my £riend

EATON
In this case you are wrong Hamet
Karamanlii is Bashaw of Tripoli

JOUBERT
That is as it should be

EATON
We must discuss your situation
‘JOUBERT
There’ are two kinds of soldiers
‘Eaton I-am not that kind

EATON
r will allow you to withdraw your
men

But Jouberts TRIPOLLTAN “LANCERS have begun to desert their
positions
JOUBERT
Withdrawing my men is not an

option It is a pity I would not
have thought it of them

EATON
In the circumstances it must be
considered consonant with honor

JOUBERT raises’a hand to stop EATON speaking

JOUBERT
I did not do what you saw at the
village But I did not prevent it
(EATON stares at him)
Do not let the Berbers cut me up

JOUBERT draws a pistol and places the barrel in his mouth
EATON flinches as the pistol shot bangs BERBERS scream and
converge

EATON hurls one man to the ground and draws his sword
defending the corpse The BERBERS stop where they are EATON
falls to his knees and looks seaward at

The FRIGATE

If you hold me in any esteem-

EATON
That is not the word

HAMET embraces EATON
HAMET
-you will go and if you have time
for it you will not let me be
forgotten

EATON - as HAMET suddenly grips him like iron- is seized by
SAILORS HAMET £astens the manacles on EATONS wrists

HAMET
In’ sh’ allah

Goodbye

HAMET turns abruptly and heads towards the town taking the
BERBERS with him

INT THE PRESIDENTS OFFICE TWILIGHT CANDLE-LIT

EATON hat under his arm stands staring at the president of
the United States

THOMAS JEFFERSON rises from a chair

JEFFERSON
Eaton

EATON
Sir

JEFFERSON

In approving your enterprize at the
first Commodore Preble exceeded
his authority That much is clear
Our talk proceeds from there

EATON
But it is not true

JEFFERSON
Is it not now I have read it in
the newspapers Including the
Federalist newspapers That
constitutes reality sir a
plurality

EATON
Preble had full authority to make
war Yet his successor had
authority from you only to make
peace at any price

JEFFERSON
Peace was oodtaied was it not And
with honor
7 EATON
Yusuf Bashaw made peace when Barron
‘promised to no longer support his
‘brother That no one knows it was
disgraceful does not mean that it
was not

JEFFERSON

One can only pull so many pistols
in a so many throne rooms Captain
Eaton

(EATON watches Jefferson

as he walks)
I hear a rumor that you intend to
present yourself for the senate is
that true

EATON
If I sought an office it would not
be the senate

JEFFERSON smiles

JEFFERSON
I think I know what you mean Will
you take wine’

EATON
No sir Thank you

JEFFERSON
We are of different parties but a
man of your abilities cannot be
ignored Safely anyway What can I
give you A commission A
consulate

EATON
Noting

JEFFERSON
Tha can always be arranged

EATON
Hamet Karamanli was executed

JEFFERSON says nothing He looks into the fire Then he looks
up at Eaton He is not unaffected by the information but he
is at the point at which a good lawyer would advise him to
say nothing His hanc trembles

JEFFERSON
What was he like
134

EATON
(after a long thoughtful
pause)
You You know what he intended to
do You have mv letters You know
what you’ve done

JEFFERSON
The United States cannot act like
an empire

EATON
This is the world You may not
stick to philosophical principle

JEFFERSON
If your friend was like me he
would put his country and people
above his own interests You would
have us an international power and
at odds with Britain We are not
ready to challenge Britain or
France Mr Eaton You understand
that Yet had I known
Communications areslow Had I
known

The men stare at each other Finally EATON smiles lightly
They understand each other EATON bows-turns-and then he
quickly walks towards the double doors

JEFFERSON
Have you money

EATON walking does not respond

JEFFERSON
Where will you go

EATON
West

The DOORS are opened by LIVERIED SLAVES There is an echo
here of the Bashaws palace EATON notices it What is before
him terrifies him oblivion Death Regret He hesitates
then as always walks on

JEFFERSON
Bonne chance
