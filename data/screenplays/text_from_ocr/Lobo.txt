EXT DEEP SPACE

A boiling shifting super-mass of primal energy fills the
screen Pulsating Blasting waves of hard radiation —
through the stellar void We are staring into the ancient
burning fury cf a red giant A dying star that has consumed
all its hydrogen and expanded to a thousand times its
original size

t spec pass ss this cosmi inerator A ship
In CLOSER SHOT we see the vessel is huge A vast tangled
structure being pushed along by a much smaller craft --like
a tugboat driving a freighter 20times its size It cruises
by with the dull THROB of engines SUPER THE LEGEND

COT TO
INT PRISON SHIP - CELL BLOCK-D - NIGHT

The technology is impressive but prison is prison Its
dank and dismal just like prison should be Automated gun
turrets cruise up and down the block on ceiling rails
Watching for trouble The worst felons of the galaxy are

stored here In a quick SERIES OF SHOTS we see some of the
alien inmates

CELL 1 A GELATINOUS CUBE A six foot block of murky
green jello with a giant eye in its center It passes the

time gliding up and down the walls leaving a slime-trail
in its wake

CELL 2 A GIANT WORMY THING Leaning against the bars

muttering giant-worm obscenities in some gibberish wormy
language

CELL 3 AN EX-POLICE DROID Even machines can be thrown
in the pokey This one is a corrupt law-enforcement droid
named M4 Dirty and stripped of his weapons you can still
see some of the markings of his former police status

CELL 4 Where theres trouble afoot In CLOSE SHOT we see
an unidentified prisoner laying out an odd assortment of
parts and pieces on a mattress theres a foot long metal
tube Two short bedsprings Two cylinders each the size of
a soup can A crudely fashioned pistol grip and a roll of
metal wire

The prisoner starcs assembling the parts just as

AN ENFORCER DROID

Moves down the row of cells titanium feet CLANKING on the
deck plates This is the prisons WARDEN and he is the
meanest fucking robot youve ever seen Heavily armored
with weapons sprouting from every conceivable place
electro-prods blades chemical jets If all else fails he

has a pair of chaincannons mounted on each of his hydraulic
arms

INT CELL 4 UNKNOWN PRISONER

Hears the approaching footsteps Works calmly but quickly
to complete his task The barrel and pistol grip have been

wired together and a trigger mechanism is inserted through
the handle

INT MAIN FLOOR

The inmates know theres something going down and a bizarre
assortment of alien appendages reach through the bars each
holding a hand mirror Watching as the Warden comes to the
last cell on the block Stops Addresses the prisoner
inside

WARDEN

Prisoner-6-4-64-1 you-will-stand-

The prisoner rolls over on his bunk A humanoid with an
educated face of dark intellect This is ARMAND THROKE
He stares at the droid Groggy

WARDEN
You-will-comply

Armand grudgingly gets to his feet and faces the wall

Along with his prison fatigues hes wearing a strange metal
collar around his neck A restraining device of some sort
(no other prisoner wears this item)

The cell GRINDS open and the warden enters Looms behind
Armand Huge and menacing

WARDEN

ARMAND
I have a gun

Indeed he does Armand whips out his jerry-rigged pistol
and pulls the trigger A rocker arm tilts releasing a
spring loaded cylinder which SLAMS into the back of a second
cylinder wedged in the gun barrel (Got that Good) BOOM

The cylinder erupts out of the muzzle and plows a gaping
Co hole through the Wardens head Metal and silicon splatter
all over the wall like exploding brain matter

The warden staggers pitches forward and crashes face-first
onto the floor Hydraulics twitch convulsively for a
moment Then all movement ceases Dead warden

INT CELL BLOCK

The prisoners go nuts Alien whoops and cheers fill the air
as Armand drags the metal carcass onto the main floor He
hauls it down to M-4s cell and props it up against the
bars The ex-enforcer droid stands stoic

A small iris opens in M-4s chest and an umbilical snake

gushes through the port

Detecting trouble They cruise down the ceiling rail
headed straight for Armand The guns arc downward and a
mechanical voice booms

Open the other cells

FULL SHOT - CELL BLOCK

Three doors open and three of the most dangerous felons in
the galaxy exit their cells

ANGLE - OMAN SHRAK

He lumbers onto the main floor a permanent scowl creased
into his granite face Shrak is strength personified His
arms hang off his sides like a pair of microwave ovens His
wrists are as big as your head This is the most obscenely
ridiculously muscle-bound mutant weve ever seen (except for
the guy who shows up on page 12)

Then theres

ANGLE - VOLARIAN

Miss Evil Eye-Candy of 1999 Darkly beautiful in a vampire
sort of way She stares at Shrak with hungry eyes Licks
her lips Its not attraction He just looks like a good
meal

ANGLE - CELL 3

Which hasnt actually opened yet A steel wall retracts
revealing a giant aquarium tank filled with water and
something else The tank is rapidly draining but as the
water level drops we see a BUMP forming in the surface
The bumps becomes a head with two glowing yellow dots that
serve as eyes

The level keeps dropping A neck is revealed then
shoulders a torso When all the water is drained
we are left with a being that is itself made of liquid
A flowing shifting bulk of living fluid CALYSTO

He goes up to the glass wall Draws back his arm for a
punch Liquid shifts to his fist enlarging it to the size
of a cynderblock Then it FREEZES solid

SMASH The ice-block blows a crater through the foot thick
glass Calysto deforms into a pillar of liquid and pours
himself through the hole Pools on the floor

Then re-forms into his normal appearance

The five villains come together All around them prisoners
are hooting screaming demanding to be released Theyre
rioting in their cells

SHRAK
What about the rest of this scum
We shouldnt just leave ‘em

ARMAND
No I suppose not

Knocked loose from its orbit around the burning red giant
Now the huge facility starts to drift into the gravity-well

an oven Inmates throw themselves against the bars 432

Where a crowd is going wild for that scrape-the-bottom-and-
give-everybody-a-taste showman of showmen JERRY SPRINGER
He waves to his loyal market share

THEME MUSIC DIMS and the applause simmers down as the camera
rolls in ror Jerrys close up He reads froma prompter

TERRY
Are we alone Is there anybody out
there That is the question we are
posing today to best selling author
Emily Urgiss

ANGLE - EMILY URGISS

Shes an attractive women in her early 30s S8right
intelligent Wears a sunny new-age smile on her face

JERRY

Three years ago she wasa reporter for
the Los Angeles Chronicle but on the
night of September 5 1996 she woke
up from a sound sleep and found herself
in the presence of beings from another
world This turned out to be only the
first of many such encounters
described in her book “Revelation A
True Account of Alien visitations
The book has sold over two million
copies and has been called the most
compelling account written on the
subject of alien abductions

(to Enily)
Emily welcome to our show
-ll-

EMILY
Thank you

TERRY
First of all is this a joke
Emily laughs good naturedly

EMILY
If it is Im still waiting» for the
punchline

JERRY

But weve heard these stovies again
and again People whisked away and
subjected to anal probes and Godknows
-what at the hands of those big-
headed skinny creatures with the
large black eyes Whats different
about your story

EMILY
Well Jerry in most cases (and Im
speaking of those accounts that appear
to be credible) the abduction is always
singular event

JERRY
Where as you were abducted how many
tines

EMILY

Twelve that I can clearly recall
It may have been more

JERRY
Okay so youve spent some quality
time with them In fact you are now
the official liaison between Earth
and the aliens Is that correct

EMILY
I dont think its official

JERRY
But youre their spokesperson Youre
delivering their message to us

EMILY
Yes
-12-

JERRY
What is that message Are they going
to take over the planet or just blow
us to bits Because thats what I
would do We are a sick sick people
Believe me I know

Ther audiance laughs heartily

EMILY
They dont see us that way These are
beings of almost divine tranquility
Theyre incapable of thinking violent
thoughts much less acting on them

SMASH CUT TO
INT BUNKER — NIGHT

A bomb-proof room built for a very special prisoner Its
dark Dead quite Then an ALARM KLAXON BLARES and a bank

of revolving red lights tell us that something bad is about
to happen

ANGLE - BULKHEADS

The doors shoot open and dozens of heavily armed TROOPERS
come storming in They take positions on a catwalk that
encircles the room Ready themselves for battle Grenades
are primed Bolts SNAP on their monstrous guns All of
them training their weapons on a single target

ANGLE - CUBE

A fourteen foot solid metal block in the center of the
floor Theres a GRINDING SOUND of machinery kicking-in and
a giant particle-beam cannon glides across the ceiling Its
muzzle angles down on the cube

The cannon FIRES and a high-energy beam rips into the block
like a nuclear blow-torch Liquefying it Metal dribbles
away forming boiling puddles of molten alloy on the floor

The troopers watch nervously Fingers coiling triggers as
we begin to see that theres something entombed in the
block A being A massive being LOBO

This cant be our hero Lobo is a demon Bluish-white skin
stretched like cellophane over a 400 pound structure of

solid muscle Long spiky black hair Glowing red eyes
with no pupils
-13-

He wears a shredded sleeveless black denim vest Armored
jackboots with skullplates over the knees A skull
beltbuckle Black jeans and a long thick chain of forged
iron wrapped around his right forearm

Dangling from the end of the chain is a gleaming steel hook
suitable for cisemboweling

Hes on the floor gnashing his teeth as globules of hot
metal drip off his body Pissed Lobo looks up at the
battery of weapons trained on him The troops outnumber him
50 to 1 Lobo snaris

LOBO
Who wants it first

CARDOON
Youre in no position to make threats

The white demon gets to his feet as Cardoon approaches

LOBO
I am now

CARDOON
What a loathsome creature you are
The last Czarian Lone survivor of a
noble race once revered throughout the
imperium And what are you A brutal
and viciously depraved sociopath

LOBO
So

CARDOON
If it was within my power Id have
you destroyed for the common good
(sighs)
But the Magistrate has ordered your
release If you agree to our terms
youll walk out of here a free man

Lobo looks up at the troops again Grins fiendishly His
blood lust is high gear He CRACKS his knuckles (which
sounds like bowling balls crashing together)

LOBO
Pass

He starts to move toward Cardoon
CARDOON

You fool Dont you understand
what Im offering
-14-

LOBO
Nuthin I cant beat outaya

The troopers ready themselves to fire Lobo doesnt care
He grabs Cardoon with one hand Draws his fist Cardoon is
two seconds from becoming bug-goo

CARDOON
IVE ALSO BEEN AUTHORIZED TO
REACTIVATE YOUR LICENSE

Magic words Lobo lowers his fist

LOBO
Alright squid-head talk fast

CARDOON
Five prisoners escaped to a planet
in the Sol system If you can bring
them back within 24 hours your
bounty-hunter license will be fully
restored

Interesting Still holding Cardoon in the air Lobo fishes
a ratty cigar stub out of his pocket Ignites it off a drip
of hot molten metal Puffs thoughtfully

LOBO
Five huh

CARDOON
Theres more to it We have reason to
believe they may be attempting to
reactivate the Drell

Lobo eyes widen three sizes

LOBO
Theres a Drell down there

CARDOON
I thought that might interest you

LOBO
Any bastitch that destroys my planet
interests me
(under his breath)
‘Specially when that was supposed to
be my amusement for the week

CARDOON
We dont have the resources to combat
the Drell a second time If you fail
the Earth will have to be destroyed
-1i5-

LoBO
What about my bike

Cardoon stares at him Confused

CARDOON
Your bike

LOBO
Its been impounded

CARDOON
I suppose it can be returned

LOBO
Well it needs a new tire

CARDOON
You obviously dont understand Im
trying to tell you the fate of an
entire world is in your hands

LOBO
AND IM TELLIN YA MY BIKE NEEDS A
NEW TIRE NOW WHATS MORE IMPORTANT

Cardoon swallows hard

CARDOON
Fine A new tire Anything else

Lobo thinks Is there anything else in the universe he
wants

LOBO
Nope

An open bay hanger crammed with confiscated space vehicles
of every sort Lobo rips off the yellow police tape from
his star-chopper Its a burly moto-beast of steel and
chrome Massive ramjet turbines flanking the exaggerated
handle bars A real space hog

He looks it over Inspects the new rear tire as Cardoon
gives him final instructions
CARDOON
The Earthers are a primitive species
Were concerned your presence could
cause significant culture shock and
civil disorder You must limit your
exposure to then

LOBO
Right No witnesses Anyone sees
me I blast ‘em on the spot

CARDOON
Thats exactly what youre not going
te do

Lobo grunts disappointment

Cardoons

CARDOON
We want you to make contact with the
proper authorities appraise them of
the situation and seek their guidance
in the planets customs and laws

LOBO
What are you nuts I got five cons
to frag

CARDOON
Youre not going toe frag anyone
The convicts are to be brought back
alive to face charges and complete
their prison sentences

LOBO
Well frags are faster Bringing ‘em
back could take two three weeks easy

LOBO
You dont have three weeks You have
24 hours Is that clear

LOBO
Yeah Make contact Find the cons
Thrash the Drell

patience is wearing thin

CARDOON
Youre not listening to me

Sure Iam Im just filtering out
the stupid parts

eat bowls of writers for breakfast

We loved the first book Emily You
know that But this alien abduction
thing is running out of steam It
needs some juice Gotta amp-it-up
(to Varney)
i think were in agreement on that

VARNEY
Completely

GRANT
So weve been kicking around some
ideas we want to float with you

-19—-

Emily feigns enthusiasm

Huh

EMILY
Great Whatve you got

VARNEY
Angels

GRANT

Theyre very big right now

VARNEY
Theyre huge Last year more people
saw angels than UFOs

GRANT
So we want you to work-in an angel
thing You know like maybe the
angels are instructing these other
worldly beings to come to Earth and
help us out That kind of deal

EMILY
I cant say that

GRANT
Why not Youre the ambassador to the
aliens You can say anything you want

EMILY
But its not credible

GRANT
So you make it credible

EMILY
But its dumb

The two execs exchange looks

GRANT
Okay were not writers Were not
telling you how to write But youve
gotta come-up with some kind of hook
Something cool Something the kids
are going to like

EMILY
I dont know how to write for kids
All they like are giant robots
smashing each other

GRANT
Perfect Write that

EMILY
This is supposed to be a serious book

GRANT
What are you Norman Mailer ‘his is
a hoax Youre a fake Now whats
the problem here

EMILY
I just dont think we have te reduce
it to the lowest common denominator

GRANT
And I assure you we do This is not
a book Emily Its junk-food Were
talking pre-digested spoon-fed crap
guaranteed to generate maximum capital
infusions into our balance sheets
Get it

downward across the city like a pack of meteors As they
pass over buildings the power dies blacking-out the
skyscrapers and creating a darkened swath that cuts clear
across the city

hammer a building less than 10 blocks away Then silence

A boarded-up factory building slated for demolition and
plastered with condemned signs and yellow tape Half the

the air

Five sealed escape pods are half-sunk into the concrete
floor Still glowing from the heat of re-entry

ANGLE - VAGRANT

A moment ago this was his home Now he‘s buried under a
pile of timbers and rubble Hes a shaggy bearded mess
Dazed Coughing dust

He digs himself part way out but his legs are pinned under
a fallen steel I-beanm

VAGRANT
GET ME OUT OF HERE

Theres a loud HISS of multiple airlocks cracking open
The vagrant looks up seeing the peds for the first time
Yellow Light spills over hin

More sounds Hatchways gliding mechanically Then
FOOTSTEPS moving through rubble The vagrant dry-swallows
his toothless mouth drawing open as he stares up at

ARMAND SHRAK VOLARIAN M-4

Looming over him M-4 is now fully rearmed and bristling
with weapons The vagrant looks around for something in the
debris A cardboard sign which he holds up It reads

other hand snatches the 600 pound steel beam and throws it
aside like a twig He lifts the vagrant into the air

you are

Armand places his hand on the vagrant‘s chest Whatever he
was expecting it doesnt happen

VOLARIAN
Your collar Armand

Remove it

M-4 transmits the code and the collar splits open with a
SNAP and falls to the floor

Armand puts his hand on the vagrant again only this time
it passes through his body (Armand can alter his molecular
density at will) He sinks his arm inside the vagrant
Feels around The vagrant writhes

Hydrolyzed soft tissue A moderately
complex web of electro-chemical

She makes her way behind the police lines

They come within 50 feet of the building No one notices
the river of water creeping across the ground Slipping
behind them Instead their eyes are glued on

She steps out of the doorway and everybody stops (she is an
eye-full) Volarian smiles Saunters up to the closest
OFFICER

OFFICER 1
You alright maam

VOLARIAN
Im hungry

The cops exchange looks

OFFICER 1
Well get you some food

VOLARIAN
You are food

She grabs his shoulders and the guy shoots rigid Teeth
clenched fingers grasping at air A clogged muffled howl
vents from his throat and then his entire body begins to
rapidly wither His eyes dry into grey powder crumbling
out of their sockets like sand Skin cracking apart and
collapsing under a diminishing frame of shrinking bones and
degenerating muscle

The only thing holding him up is Volarian Her body lilts
head arcing back in some strange alien rapture as she sucks
the life out of hin

The other cops fumble for their guns Too late Volarian
pushes the mummified corpse away and it shatters on the
ground like clay pottery

EMILY
Holy shit

Armand and Shrak join their comrade as another officer
levels his service revolver

Reaches into a squad car and grabs a shotgun off the

He spins around Stares in shock as the water-thing steps
into him The cop is now encased in a thick membrane of
liquid Anywhere he goes Calysto follows him move for move
He cant breath Desperately fires his shotgun Buckshot
bursts through the watery shell Zero effect

The cop staggers Holding his breath Turning blue
Until he finally cant take it He inhales and water floods
his lungs Instant death

Another cop has taken cover underneath a cruiser Shrak
presses down on the front end pushing the vehicle into the

Then they EXPLODE and the car CRUSHES down on the cop

Scared out of her mind A fallen officers pistol clatters
on the pavement just a few feet out of her reach She wants
a weapon emily grabs a bhent-up coat hanger out of the

the gun behind the dumpster

As shes working the sounds of gun-battle rapidly diminish

Walking through the carnage scanning back and forth He
knows one person is still unaccounted for Then he hears
the sound of a gun cylinder SNAPPING closed Starts to move
towards the dumpster

beams wraps around the dumpster like a laser-scan at a
supermarket One of the beams touches her Detection

The powerful droid shoves the dumpster sending it rocketing
into her like a train SMASH Emily is thrown backward
her head smacking hard against a brick wall Lights out

FULL SHOT

Bodies litter the ground Shrak and Volarian pick through
the spoils looking for anything of interest Volarian
pulls out an cffisers wallet Its stuffed with money
She tosses the bills away like so much paper

Hes found a map of the city in one of the cruisers
Spreads it over the hood a car and studies it intently

VOLARIAN
These people have nothing

He guns the engine and the bike rushes over the snari of
traffic jumping to the head of the pack He finds a spot
to land Thumbs a switch and a pair of doughy tires emerge

with the front of the car

Through the COPS POV we see a massive fist SMASH through
the hood of the car like it was made out of paper

Lobo vanks the engine block right through the hood
The cruiser instantly slows to a crawl

EXT HIGHWAY - LOBO

Leaving the cops in the dust He tosses the engine block
away and it CLANGS across pavement until it comes to rest on

He starts to head back for his chopper

bullet slug out of his forehead and snaps it off his finger

a beer bottle on the wall

He tips back his glasses revealing those terrible red eyes
Grins broadly

LOBO

Lobo stomps the starter pedal and the turbines spin to
power Guns the throttle The front tire pops into the air
like a rearing horse and then it shoots off down the street

Emily watches as the bike disappears over the horizon
engines fading Then turns to face a fleet of approaching
police cars coming from the opposite direction

The guy is scared out of his wits He brings them to the
end of the passageway and we see

At first it looks like a hopeless task but then the
metal begins to CREAK with strain Shrak keeps pulling
Groaning with effort his face twisted-up in furious
determination

CRACK A fracture line splits the concrete wall

The massive door gives a littie A little more And then

EXT NUCLEAR PLANT - GATE HOUSE -— NIGHT

Emily watches a long line of police cars approaching from
the distance Theyre about five minutes away Lobo throws
a knife-switch and the electrified gate closes mechanically
Latches Locks He smashes the control box off the wall
and it shorts-out in a shower of sparks

LOBO
(re approaching cops)
That should slow them down

EMILY
As ambassador of Earth I think this
is a really bad idea and Id like to
go home now

LOBO
Noted Go get me some water for ny

She gives him a quizzical look

LOBO
Just do it

She goes into the gate house as Lobo reaches into his pocket
and produces a tiny two inch rifle It looks like a-gun

for a GI-Joe doll He sets it on the ground Emily returns
with a dixie cup of water Stares at the diminutive weapon

like a dried-out sponge Growing Expanding Within
seconds it enlarges into a 100 pound behemoth of a cannon
Lobo picks it up Pulls back the bolt with a crisp SNAP

EMILY
Whats the plan

LoBO
Blowing them to pieces usually works
Ill try that first

EMILY
You said you were going to take them

Alive is a very broad tern

He drags her over to the car and clamps the other cuff onto

INT NUCLEAR PLANT - WASTE VAULT - NIGHT

Shrak rips open a welded steel container Inside are the
reactors spent fuel rods He breaks off the cap and dumps
a handful of plug-sized plutonium pellets into his hand

SHRAK
Jackpot

CLINK The sound of a metal hook scraping the floor

Shrak and Calysto spin around Theres a figure standing in
the steam and red light of the tunnel Puffing a stogie a
steel hook hanging by his side

Shrak narrows his eyes

SHRAK
Lobo

LOBO -
Hello Oman Hope you didnt bl
your wad on these Earthers
Its frag time

Shrak yanks a grenade off his belt Primes it with his
thumb

SHRAK
Frag this

He heaves the grenade and it lands right at Lobos feet
FRAGGBOOOM

This is not your average hand grenade The thing explodes
like a thousand pound bomb and a boiling fireball blows
through the tunnel blasting out the walls and ceiling
Half the passageway collapses When the dust settles Lobo
is gone Buried under tons of boulder-sized rubble and
debris

That was easy Shrak sneers

SHRAK
So much for the Main Man

SMASH Lobo bursts through the concrete pile eyes wild
LOBO
HAW What a rush I just love
guys who to try to waste me

He pulls his gun from the rubble Starts tromping towards
Shrak and Calysto

LOBO
Yep youre my kinda guy Oman
Almost makes me feel bad for aii the
carnage and brutality Im about to
unload on you

Shrak gets more serious He throws his elbow into a cast
iron water-pipe running along the wall Breaks it open
Turns to Calysto and hands him the nuclear pellets

SHRAK
Get these back Ill take care of
hin

Calysto deforms into a pillar of fluid and dives down the
pipe Gone

SHRAK and LOBO

Shrak gets to his feet grinning slyly He wants this as
bad as Lobo does He pulls back the bolt of his gun Lobo
is just ten feet away Stops The two level their
ridiculous weapons on each other

SHRAK
Here I am blue-boy Whatcha got for
me

LOBO
Lead

This has to be the dumbest gunfight anyone has ever seen
The two of them simply stand at point blank range and fire
their cannons into each other CHAK -CHAK-CHAK-CHAK-CHAK

Bullets erupt through both of them Blood holes galore
Neither moves for cover They hold their ground exchanging
thousands of rounds A fog of bullets fills the air and
bits of meat go flying off them like chipped paint

The weird thing is they can take it Sort of

Both have hundreds of smoking hot slugs half-buried in their
faces and bodies but neither one of them shows any sign of
aiscomfort In fact theyre definitely grooving on it

CHAK -CHAK-CHAK-CHAK-CHAK Time passes Mounds of
spent shellcasing collect at their feet They continue
blasting away at each other until they finally run out of
ammo Toss their weapons aside

Shrak draws a grizzly Bowie knife from a boot sheath
Lobo grips his hock
55-

The two move in on each other boots splashing through the
carpet of spent shell-casings that covers the floor

CLOSE SHOT - SHRAK

Reaching behind his back where a second weapon is

concealed Its a single shot pistol with a barrel the
width of a Quaker Oats cylinder

As Lobo launches his attack Shrak whips out the gun and
fires BOOM ci on ba sinto os stomach

OOOF The Czarian buckles over In pain

This is Shraks chance He takes the giant vault ‘door and
swings it into the wounded Czarian CLANG The door pins
him against the steel frame Shrak throws ali his alien
strength into closing the vault on Lobo trying to squish
him into Cheese Whiz It looks like a good plan

Lobo struggles against the impossible pressure Gritting
his teeth Veins popping out of his skin Shrak pours it
on even more We hear whatever terrible sound 26 inch thick
steel makes when its being compressed around a Czarian

All the while Shrak is screaming

SHRAK
DIE DIE DIE

Its this last part that really gets on Lobos nerves

LOBO
Ahh shadup

Lobo wildly surges forward with such insane force that he
rips the 20 ton door off its hinges and SLAMS it into Shrak
Both the door and Shrak CRASH through the tunnel wall like
it was made out of pie crust

INT TURBINE ROOM

Lobo jumps through the hole in pursuit ready to issue more
punishment He peels the vault door off the ground
expecting to find Shrak flattened like a bug

But Shrak aint there Lobo glances around Whered he go

LoBo
Dont go squirrely on me Oman

He moves past a two story cooling pump A shadow creeps
behind him WHAM Shrak clobbers him over the head with

a thick iron pipe Lobo goes spacey WHAM another blow to
the back of his legs and the big guy hits the deck
-56—

Shrak finishes him off with a brutal upper-cut that catches
Lobo square in the jaw Lays him out Not unconscious but
the little birdies are definitely flying around his head

ANGLE - SHRAK

He tosses the pipe away Stands over the catatonic Lobo
Whats the best way to kill this guy Shrak knows He
grabs Lobo by the throat and drags him toward

THE TURBINE

One of several steam driven generators the cover the floor
Through the side vents we see huge magnetos spinning around
ina blur Half a million horsepower of thrashing metal
Now if you were to stick someones head in there

Capital idea Shrak drags him head first toward the vent
Lobo comes out of his daze just enough to cogitate that hes
about to be decapitated

His fingers rip into the floor No dice They simply plow
through the tiles He punches Shrak in the face Solidly
Repeatedly Probably hurts like hell but Shrak takes the

pain Hes totally motivated

They reach the turbine Lobo braces himself against the
turbines frame But inch by inch hes losing ground
The turbine blades WHIR over his head

CLOSE SHOT - LOBO

This is pissing him off He gives up one hand of his
bracing and throws his hook The chain un-reels off his
forearm and the hook sails through the air CLANK Secures
onto a ceiling girder

The chain goes taut The girder starts to bend Its only
going to buy him a few seconds

Lobo gives up his remaining brace and his free hand searches
for purchase on Shraks body Nothing Nothing And
then he finds it Theres another hand grenade hanging off

Shraks belt Lobo grins

He thumbs the primer as Shrak inches his head into the
spinning blades

SHRAK
Adios Czarian

LOBO
Say cheese ya pathetic drooling
bastitch

Shrak grins broadly flashing his porcelain choppers
Perfect Lobos fist drives upward like a piston

He SMASHES through the wall of teeth and rams the grenade
right dewn Shraks throat Gulp

Shrak looses his grip Stumbles backward Gagging
Shattered teeth crumbling out of his mouth

SHRAK

mirrors He takes out a small device that looks like a
hockey puck Commands it

Armand reaches out the window and places the annoying puck
on the roof of the cab

Steel claws emerge like spider legs and an antenna web
telescopes out and unfurls It locks-on to the cruiser

The puck crab-scuttles across the roof of the truck
It climbs up the back wall of the cargo container Crawls
to the edge

It disables the police vehicle A six foot steel spike
pierces through the hood and drives straight down into the
pavement (how a six foot spike fits into a hockey puck will
be debated for years) Anyhow

Its like dropping an anchor The front of the cruiser nose
dives into the ground 90 to © MPH in one second flat

The rest of the vehicle wants to keep moving It SNAPS the
chassis apart and the rear two thirds of the car go flying
over the unmovable front end CRASHES on its roof and skids
another fifty yards in a trail of sparks

EXT CITY - DIAMOND DISTRICT

M-4 is holding Lobo over his head (an impressive feat)
With all his mechanical might he pile-drives the Czarian
straight into the pavement with the force of an asteroid
Lobo goes right through the street

INT SUBWAY STATION

And RUPTURES through the ceiling of the tunnel

He crashes onto the train platform concrete and steel
showering down on him from the crater overhead Lobo

winces crawling out of the debris Grits his teeth

CLACK A pair of titanium feet land in front of hin

The droid grabs him by the throat and throws Lobo against
the tiled wall Pins him Draws his other arm’for a punch

Not this time Lobo swats the bracing arm away and in a
furious burst of strength he grabs the robot by the groin
and neck and hoists him over his head

It looks like hes about to repeat M-4s pile-driving stunt
but thats not what Lobo has in mind

Instead he tears the droid in half

Theres a BURST of sparks as M4s mechanical spine rips out
of his hip structure Arms and legs flailing wildly
Machine fluids gushing over the ground like blood

Lobo throws the upper torso in one direction legs and
pelvis in another

behind him and pins him to the ground with a boot He
takes a can opener from his pocket Drives the point into
the back of M-4s head and peels open a skull plate
revealing banks of computer chips

and starts draining the life out of him Energy crackles
between them Volarian swaying slowly soaking up the
incredible reserves of power Her eyes widening with new
found strength

Lobo begins to wilt If he was human hed be dust by now
but the drain is «aking its toll His knees go soft
Head hanging Growing weaker and weaker

- Volarian finally pushes him back Stares at him with a
mixture of awe and contempt Then backhands him with a
thunderous blow that sends Lobo crashing into a news stand

Lobo groans in dizzy pain Hes in real trouble Cant
even get to his feet

What a fool you are With your power
you could conquer worlds

possible How much time do you have
left to apprehend us

Out of the question An Imperial

they dont find the Czarian theyll
know hes failed and destroy the

buys us time

Theres a fleet of police vehicles heading towards them
Armand grins

state of awareness The police sirens grow louder

system At any other time hed drink this stuff for fun
but in his current condition its absolutely lethal

engine and dismounts

LOBO
Okay water-weenie well start with
you

Its a bad start Lobo draws his machine pistol and unloads
into Calysto Bullets SPLASH in and out of him Completely
useless

ANGLE - CALYSTO

He freezes solid turning himself into a giant ice golem
The thing lumbers toward Lobo Raises its icy fists and
hurls a swooping overhand

Lobo easily ducks the blow and fires back But at the very
instant his knuckles should be shattering Calystos chest
the ice dissolves into water Lobos arm goes right through
and comes out his back

Instantly it freezes solid again leaving Lobos arm
encased in Calystos frozen body

Lobo is now easy game Calysto hammers him repeatedly with
his cinder block fists SMASH SMASH SMASH

Comes up from behind and clobbers Calysto over the head with
a fire axe Chips off some ice Calysto doesnt even
notice

WAILS him against the wall Calysto explodes into ice -
slush Melts into back into water We can still see the
two yellow dots of his eyes as the puddle creeps across the
floor

LOBO
GET BACK HERE AND TAKE YOUR MEDICINE

Lobo stomps the puddle with his boots SPLASH SPLASH
No effect The watery mass creeps up the side of a fountain
and mixes with the churning pool

Lobo jumps inte the fountain trying to find him Its like
finding a needle in-a bag of needles But if you look real
close you can make out a feint outline of something
slipping down the drain Gone

And his clothes are five sizes too small

Hey fatbody You seen a six foot
pile of water come through here

looking about 300 pounds thinner and very croaked Lobo
kneels down Prods the body

Anybody in there

Nope He stands up Calysto is standing right behind hin

He goes for his best parlor trick The water thing steps
into Lobo and completely engulfs him Lobo is now cocooned
in a translucent membrane of fluid Anywhere he goes
Calysto follows him move for move Dittos his every
‘gesture

Lobo fumbles around not sure how to deal with this one

Idea 1 He takes his machine pistol and shoots himself
CHAK-CHAK-CHAK-CHAK Gets a few more bullet holes

Idea 2 Lobo goes over to a stack of steel girders and
smashes his head against the metal SPLASH-CLANG SPLASH-
CLANG Nothing Lobo blurts an obscene torrent of curses
that come out as jets of bubbles

But then Lobo smiles slyly Knows idea 3 is the right one
He blows out all the air in his lungs and INHALES His
chest and cheeks swell to obscene proportions as he sucks in
Calystos 300 pound mass like a bilge pump Holds it in
His cheeks look like melons as he tromps over to

A CEMENT MIXER

Lobo hits the switch and mixer drum starts revolving
He rips open a bag of Sancrete Dumps it into the drun
Then he exhales Calystos bulk into the mix

The drum spins for a moment

Then a muddy concrete Calysto leaps out of the mixer
Hits the ground with a graceless SPLAT The water-thing
struggles to pull himself into humanoid form Cant

finish him off Hes holding a trowel

The Drell appears to be a no-show Armand still has the

VOLARIAN
This was a stupid plan “Shatter the

incinerated along with the rest of
these primates

ARMAND
Wait

VOLARIAN
For what

She walks right up to the portal Stares into the shifting
field Through the mist of energy we can vaguely make out
some sort of landscape on the other side A very empty
landscape

VOLARIAN
Theres nothing in there

ARMAND
Thats impossible

She turns to Ammand

VOLARIAN
Youre an idiot

But at that second a huge powerful arm of pure energy
reaches through the field and grabs Volarian like a Barbie-
doll She screams as shes yanked through the portal
Disappears

A second later a charred meaty skeleton spills out of the
portal and lands on the floor in a smoking heap Its still
alive Barely The boney thing crawls on its elbows toward
Armand spitting sparks as the last of her powers fizzle
away Collapses Dead

Armand regards this event with cold detachment

And then the DRELL bounds through the field with a horrible
wail of anger Hits the floor Here it is

FULL SHOT - THE DRELL

It is a living fog of unstable nuclear forces Hulking
Vaguely man-shaped A walking 12 foot storm of raw energy
with swirling clouds of gaseous plasma moving through it
Webs of lightning bursting inside its shifting forn
STROBING the room in burning white light

Armand stands before it The Drell look down on him like a
bug Raises an arm Hes obviously about to get —
splattered

Armand quickly fumbles around his pockets Find the key
(the same key used to open the heads way back on page 35)
He holds it up for the Drell to see

The Drell lowers its blow Speaks in a crackling electrical
voice that sounds like static feedback

DRELL
Command me my master

Armand smiles This is going to work out just fine

ARMAND
Destroy all life on this planet
(thinks)
Except mine of course

DRELL
Immediately

ANGLE - DRELL

It places its club-like hands on the wall and a stream of
destructive energy flows through the granite Expanding
like a wave

Everything it touches instantly degenerates into a grey
decomposing crust Cracked and fissured and completely
depleted of all mineral content

The energy wave rapidly smothers over anything in its path
sconces paintings plants and displays All withered into
the same dried-out crust

It totally consumes the wall and starts spreading into the
floor and ceiling In fact it would eat the entire
building the entire’ block the entire city and everything
else in the world if it werent for

stumbling across the floor

Lobo pursues grinning with the lust for battle It doesnt
get any better than this As the Drell stands up he plows
his fist into it again SMASH Sends it ass-over-teacups
into a display case of tribal masks

The Drell pulis itself out of the debris

KILL THE CZARIAN

The Drell gets the message Throws a big right that hits
the Lobo square in the puss Lobo gets a genuinely
disappointed look

having less and less effect

“On the third shot The Drell catches the incoming anchor and

stops it dead in the air Then a surge of energy flows
through its hands and the steel anchor rapidly degenerates
into brittle slag Crumbles apart

96-

No matter Lobo goes back to his trusty fists Hammers it
with a left-right comho The Drell barely reacts this time
It absorbs the two blows with hardly a flinch and then
backhands him CASMASH

Its probably one of the worst shots Lobos ever taken
The big guy goes crashing through a display of fishing gear
Plows through a whaling boat and collides like an artillery
shell against a massive marble column The pillar explodes
on impact and huge chunks of stone come crashing down

CLOSE SHOT - LOBO

Sitting on the floor in a heap He rubs his jaw painfully
as the Drell moves across the floor towards hin

LOBO
Is it my imagination or are you
getting tougher on me

Armand laughs contemptuously

ARMAND
The more you strike him Czarian the
stronger he becomes

LOBO
Now you tell me

From half a floor away the Drell hurls a burning clump of
plasma It sizzles through air and strikes him square in
the chest BURSTS

Instantly a web of corrosive energy rips through Lobos
body He grits his teeth struggling againstthe
unstoppable forces His chest becomes grey Then his neck
His head And Lobo is transformed into a statue of himself
A hunk of grey porus slag Lifeless Dead

One good shot and hed crumble apart The Drell moves in
Raises his arm for the blow BLAM BLAM BLAM

ANGLE - EMILY

Unloading her revolver into its back The bullets burn up
the second they make contact but its enough to get the
Drells attention It turns on her Hurls another gob of
plasma

Emily dives for cover and the plasma ball SPLATS against a
wall over her head Degenerates a 10 foot section of it
She scrambles out of the room and into
-97-

INT MEDIEVAL ROOM

Emily looks around The room is filled with armaments from
the middle ages suits of armor broad swords falchions
Theres even a giant siege engine battering ram No other
room connects with this one Thus no way out Whatever
happens it happens here

The Drell comes through the entrance (this thing doesnt
move fast) Sees Emily at the other end of the floor
Moves towards her crashing through everything that stands
between them Whatever it touches instantly ignites

ANGLE - EMILY

Theres no where to hide She thinks hard Desperate for
anything Aims her gun Not at the Drell but at a fire
sprinkler in the ceiling BLAM The bullet blows the head
off the nozzle and a gusher of water rains down from the
ceiling Splashes over the super-heated Drell instantly
boils off and engulfing the room in clouds of steaming fog

Emily dives for cover on the floor becoming lost in the
misty vapor

INT NAUTICAL ROOM

Where the Venus DeLobo is on display Nothing has changed
Hes still a dead grey statue From the other room we hear
the Drell howling in anger Smashing antiquities

A beat Then something stirs in the statue and two tiny red
dots appear in the middle of Lobos stone grey eye sockets
The red expands Fills the sockets Then his temples
smooth and the skin turns icy-blue

Those recuperative powers really are off the scale
Meanwhile

INT MEDIEVAL ROOM

The Drell is getting frustrated trying to find Emily in this
steambath In blind rage it randomly hurls clods of hot
plasma in every direction

ANGLE EMILY

Hiding under the cover of fog as plasma balls BURST against
the walls all around her She crawls on the floor in no
particular direction Comes across a heavy broadsword on the
ground It might be better than nothing She picks it up

Crawls a little further and stops Something is glowing and
its right in front of her No more hiding
-98-—

FULL SHOT - DRELL

Emily springs up wielding the sword in a double-hand grip
Hacks it down squarely on the Drells head The blade
disintegrates on contact and Emily is left holding a melted
stump

She backs up a foot or two Hits a wall Shes backed
herself into the corner Game over

The Drell raises its arm to strike a deathblow when
ANGLE —- LOBO

Throws his shoulder behind the heavy siege engine and pushes
it full bore across the floor The battering ram BULLDOZES
into the Drell smashing it right through the concrete wall
and back into

INT PORTAL ROOM - DRELL

Hits the floor in a pile of debris Lobo bounds through the
hole after it

The Drell hurls a barrage of plasma bolts Lobo dodges them
and they hit the wall inflicting the usual damage

But one of them c e of the ceramic capacitors
Disintegrates a section of it Theres a burst of smoke and
sparks The power dips

And the portal begins to fail It flickers and strobes and
the 12x14 foot hole in space begins to shrink

ANGLE - LOBO and DRELL

Lobo gets in close and wails on the Drell with a furious
volley punches

LOBO
(SMASH)
Now let me get this straight
(SMASH)
The more I hit you
(SMASH)
The more you like it
(SMASH)
Youre my kinda guy Drelly

The Drell absorbs the Blows Almost impervious to them
But inch by inch Lobos knocking it backwards Moving it
closer and closer to the portals field
-99-

Its just a foot or two away when the Drell has decided
enough is enough

DRELL
You bore me Czarian Now you die

The Drell takes a big killer swing at him but Lobo ducks
the blow and dives headlong into the Drell Rams it
backwards the last few feet and then both of them tumble
into the portal together

Instantly theyre teleported to
EXT DIMENSION-X

This could be hell Another world with a burning red sky
that flows like a river of lava Not even in this universe
Wherever we are it is a world thats been decimated by 3000
years of Drell occupation

The ground has been broiled into a charred wasteland almost
without end Parched Cracked Immense craters and
fissures ripped into the surface creating bottomless voids
that drop a thousand miles straight to the planets molten
core

The only other feature in this desolate place is the hole in
space where the port2l has been opened It floats over the
ground A rip in the fabric of this dimension

ANGLE - LOBO AND DRELL

The two come tumbling through the portal and hit the ground
hard Scramble to their feet

The Drell eyes the shrinking portal First hell have to
get past Lobo It lunges at him and the two swap punches
back and forth The Czarians blows are almost entirely
ineffectual while the Drell hits like a wrecking ball
Lobos head snaps back and forth from the impacts Taking
its toll

INT MUSEUM - PORTAL ROOM

Back in the real universe the portal equipment continues to
blows circuits Fires break out Emily goes for an
extinguisher hanging off one of the rooms pillars

But as she does this we see a blurry rippling bulge moving
through the wall Armand The ripple moves down

the pillar As Emily takes the extinguisher his upper-
torso emerges from the stone Its weird Hes half man
half pillar like some animated gargoyle He grabs her from
behind and hooks his arm around her neck
-100-

SMASH CUT To
EXT DIMENSION-X CLOSE SHOT - LOBO

SMASH A glowing fist caves in the left side of his face
SMASH The right side gets it

FULL SHOT

Lobo stops fighting Teeters The drell sees weakness and
a ball of plasma forms at the end of its arm It winds up
for the pitch

Lobo suddenly surges forward and drives the steel toe of his
boot right into the Drells groin Even on a nuclear super-
being groin shots suck The Drell gasps Buckles over

DRELL
MY SPRAGS

Lobo grabs the incapacitated Drell and lifts it over his
head Carries it over to the ledge of a

MASSIVE FISSURE

One of those bottomless pits mentioned earlier The Drells
eyes widen with doom

LOBO
Paroles over for you ya flaming
bastitch

He hurls the Drell into the void and a wail of agonizing
horror echoes on and on Lobo watches with profound
satisfaction as the falling Drell becomes a tiny black dot
Finally vanishes

The portal Its down to the size of an oven Lobo sprints
for the shrinking hole and dives through it

INT MUSEUM —- PORTAL ROOM

He crashes on the floor Only to find himself staring
straight up at Armand Hes still half-buried in the pillar
with his arms hooked around Emily

Lobo grins Starts to move toward them

LOBO
The last frags always the best

ARMAND
Another step and Ill reach into her
skull and rip her brain out
-101-

He stops

ARMAND
I offer an exchange Your vehicle
for this creature

LOBO
TRADE MY WHEELS FOR A BROAD
ARE YOU FRAGGIN NUTS
EMILY
Hey

ARMAND
As you wish If shes worth nothing
to you shes worth even less to me
Armands hand becomes etherial

In CLOSE SHOT we see Emily reaching behind her back
Grabs scmething

Just as Armand is about to plunge his hand her arm swings
up and she SNAPS the restraining collar around his neck

Instant s hand becomes solj morta esh

ARMAND
No

Yes Armand releases Emily desperately clawing at the
collar Claw away pal Its on and it aint coming off

Hes now permanently stuck in the pillar

Which should be bad enough But not for Lobo He wraps his
arms around the column and RIPS it out of floor Heaves it
up over his head and carries it over to

THE PORTAL

Its shrinking fast but theres still just enough room left
to slip a pillar through it

ARMAND
NO YOU CANT DO-

Lobo hurls the pillar into the hole and it vanishes

FULL SHOT

At that instant (as is always the case) the field collapses
and the portal controls explode in a final eruption of
sparks and fire The portal is closed Ruined Forever

respect

LOBO

BAYLOR

He looks her square in the eye

BAYLOR

EMILY
What alien Its all a big hoax

CRASH

The star chopper explodes through the roof of the building
and Lobo streaks into the sky Everyone looks up The
gleaming chopper loops in the air Then dives down buzzing
right over the their heads

For a split second Lobo locks eyes with Emily Grins to
her Then he guns the engine and rockets into the sky

CLOSE SHOT - BAYLOR

Watches his gravy-train leaving the station without him
Looks to Emily with murder in his eyes
-104-

BAYLOR

brilliantly consuming her Then its gone Empty

vanished
