EXT ANYCITY USA - THE DEAD OF NIGHT
Peering down from above onto this sleeping berg

DJ (V0)

It’s three o’clock in the morning
ladies and germs that’s oh-three
hundred in the am so stay
frosty keep your eyes on the road
and that dial locked and loaded
I’m Ray Richards and I’1l be your
captain this evening on Red-Eye
radio 937 the Rage

HEAVY METAL BLARES OVER OPENING TITLES as we take note of
the few lonely vehicles on the main thoroughfare We’re
interested in those two over there a dark grey PRISON
TRANSFER van (DEPT OF CORRECTIONS stenciled on the side)
and a POLICE CRUISER following closely behind

MORTON (VO)
So the guy’s horny as hell right
But he’s only got ten bucks

INT VAN - NIGHT —- CONTINUOUS - MOVING

GILES 25 a clean-cut uniformed cop drives while
DETECTIVE MORTON 40‘s suit and loosened tie sits in
the passenger seat

A dark silhouetted hulk of a FIGURE lurks in the bg
Handcuffed to the walls of his wire cage

MORTON
So he goes to this whorehouse --
(re radio music)
-- What is this crap

He turns it off

DARK FIGURE
That was “Fist” Their debut
concert April 14 1987 They
single-handedly ushered in a new
heavy metal sound by applying
traditional jazz undertones the
appreciation of which is sorely
lacking

MORTON
That’s because it’s crap
DARK FIGURE
It’s genius

MORTON
(resuming the joke)
So the guy goes to this whorehouse
and tells the Madame “Lady I
need to get laid right now”

Giles titters in amusement keeping his eyes on the road

MORTON (CONT’D)
She takes his measly ten bucks
says it ain’t much but she can
still help him out So she tells
him to go in the first door he
finds

Giles nods taking a sip of coffee

MORTON (CONT’D)
So he goes in the first door and
finds a chicken sitting on the
bed

GILES
A chicken

MORTON
That’s what he says But he’s
horny as hell so after a little
soul searching he gives in and
fucks the chicken

Giles chuckles

DARK FIGURE (0S)
Naturally

MORTON
(doing his best to
ignore)
Rides the poor thing half to
death Feathers flying
everywhere right So the next
week he’s even hornier --—

DARK FIGURE (KRUG OS)
Please spare us the “next week”
Detective Morton

MORTON
(irritated now)
Spare you Krug
KRUG
Yes Spare me

MORTON
And why would I ever do you the
courtesy you piece of shit

KRUG
(nodding 0S)
Because we’re about to miss our
exit
Morton looks back Krug’s right

MORTON
Giles this is it --

Giles swerves the van down the exit ramp

GILES
Sorry

KRUG
You’re welcome

MORTON

You in a hurry or something Krug

The figure leans forward emerging from the shadows to
expose KRUG (early 30s) a handsome muscular man with
cold hard features

KRUG
Yeah I‘m in a hurry to eat

MORTON
What you think we’re moving you
to a friggin five-diamond Hilton
They’re still gonna feed you the
same maggot-infested shit

KRUG
Hmm Well that is disconcerting
Sure you can’t drop me at that
Hilton

MORTON
Pretty sure

KRUG
Holiday Inn Express

MORTON
In your dreams my friend In
your dreams
This as the van approaches a red light at a quiet
INNER CITY INTERSECTION

Giles looks out waits for a couple of approaching cars

to pass -- a station wagon and a heavy duty pick-up The
station wagon innocently goes by -- but the
PICK-UP

suddenly SWERVES AND RAMS THE VAN FWAM The truck
SMASHES into the front half of the van spinning it
ninety degrees in an explosion of flying metal debris

The cops in the cruiser behind the van throw open their
doors jump out and open FIRE on the truck POP POP POP
The truck’s windshield explodes The cops cease fire
only to hear the voice of a WOMAN OS

WOMAN (0S)
‘Scuse me

The cops whirl around to see a masked woman standing
behind the open driver’s side door of the station wagon
that passed the van just seconds earlier The gunfire
must have masked her approach She levels a silenced
nine-millimeter pistol at the cops and FIRES two quick
efficient shots BAM BAM The cops drop

The woman steps forward calls out to the smashed pick-
up

WOMAN (CONT’D)
You alright in there

A quick silent beat Then --

MASKED MAN (0S)
Never better

The pick-up’s door pushes open revealing another masked
MAN we’‘ll soon know as FRANCIS early 30’s He hops out
dusts off shards of glass from the windshield makes a
beeline for the van’s passenger side door Opens it to
reveal

MORTON

groaning weakly in the passenger seat blood leaking from
a severe gash on his head

Giles is slumped over the wheel motionless and bloody
Francis reaches inside taking Morton’s GLOCK and a pair
of keys tosses them to the woman who quickly unlocks the
van’s back-door and looks inside her wide eyes nervous
and uncertain

MASKED WOMAN
Krug You okay

A beat Then -- Krug sits up from the darkness -- shaken
but uninjured

KRUG
Neck hurts a little

MASKED WOMAN
(unlocking him)
Well don’t sue me I’m uninsured

As soon as the cuffs drop away Krug RIPS the woman’s
mask off to reveal a 20ish hardened beauty Call her
SADIE Krug cups her face gives her an intensely quick
kiss

SADIE
(re the smashed van)
Whaddaya think Perfect timing
huh I do good Tell me I did
good

KRUG
You mostly did good

SADIE
(playfully shoves
him)
Mostly
KRUG

I told you my neck hurts Sadie

SADIE
Well something’s gonna hurt a lot
worse if you keep critiquing my
handiwork

KRUG
Ooh

SADIE
(then with urgency)
C’mon let’s get you outta here

WITH FRANCIS - He yanks Morton out of the van Morton
hits the concrete with a weak cry of pain crippled by
broken bones
Francis looks over sees Krug and Sadie coming around

KRUG
Francis where’s my kid

FRANCIS
Don’t call me Francis He’s fine

SADIE
But still sad about his mom

KRUG
Then he’s the only one

This as Krug grabs the Glock from Francis stands over
Morton taking aim --

MORTON
Are you gonna kill me

A tense beat as Krug’s finger starts to depress the
trigger Then --

KRUG
Nah I don’t have the energy I’m
starving remember
Krug hands the gun back to Francis
KRUG (CONT’D)
(nonchalant)
Pull that trigger will you
Francis re-focuses on Morton -- and FIRES -- the
deafening gunshot is matched by a DEAFENING ALARM CLOCK
as we

SMASH TO

INT MARI’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

A hand SLAMS down on the clock 525 AM Pan to reveal
MARI COLLINGWOOD 17 and wide awake Natural beauty
Deep determined breath then -- she throws the covers
off -- JUMP TO

QUICK SHOTS --

- Mari slipping into swim suit

- Throwing on shorts tank top

- Doing a set of quick curls with small handheld
weights
- Grabs swim cap and red-tinted goggles tosses them in a
duffel bag

KERSPLASH Mari dives into a pool We are

EXT OLYMPIC SIZE POOL - EARLY MORNING

Magic hour Sun just peeking over the horizon Nota
soul in sight Just Mari She surfaces from the dive
goes into a full bore butterfly swimming all out This
girl’s clearly intense and clearly has talent

CU - MARI - in the pool - nearing the wall increases
her speed almost there

She nears the wall reaches out of the pool grabs up a
STOPWATCH Anxiously clicks it Peels off her goggles
eyes the result Shakes her head Disappointed

A beat Then --

EMMA (0S)
Youll do it

Mari startles slightly spins around to see her mom
EMMA 41 confident fit earthy good looks

MARI
I don’t believe you

EMMA
Well if it was somebody else’s
record you were trying to beat
you might have cause

MARI
One more try

EMMA
Nope Were leaving

MARI
Right now But I haven’t even --

EMMA

MARI
But I still need to --
Emma cuts her off revealing the Starbucks tray and two
coffees she was hiding behind her back Off Emma -- she
can’t help but crack a smile --

SMASH TO

INT HOSPITAL - ER TRAUMA ROOM - MORNING

On DR JOHN COLLINGWOOD 45 exhausted from a double
shift with the stubble to prove it (but it also makes him
more handsome than he already is)

He’s focused on a 50’ish convulsing male patient HADLEY
NURSES surround the table assisting Palpable tension

JOHN
Goddammit where’s that O-neg

A nurse races in with the blood John grabs it Hooks
up the transfusion

JOHN (CONT’D)
Have the OR prep four more units
tell them to stand by

The nurse leaves

JOHN (CONT’D)
You’re gonna be okay Mr Hadley
Try to breathe normally
(to nurse)
Five milligrams dopamine --

The nurse administers the shot The patient calms

JOHN (CONTD)
There you go Mr Hadley you’re
doing great

(to nurses )
Alright let‘’s get our VIP guest
Mr Hadley here up to the
penthouse suite pronto

John looks down at Mr Hadley who reaches out trying to
mouth a thank you -- John nods with a reassuring smile as
the nurses wheel Hadley into the hall

ON JOHN - standing there as the trauma room falls silent
He exhales in relief Scoops off his mask runs a hand
through his hair Looks up to see EMMA peeking through
the window in the door She slowly pushes it open

JOHN (CONT’D)
Emma I can’t --
EMMA
Sorry you’re off duty Doctor
Collingwood

JOHN

But I haven’t even --
EMMA
I already packed for you --
EXT FOREST ROAD - DAY

The Collingwood’s SUV negotiates the winding curves

INT SUV - DAY - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

Mari driving Emma in the passenger seat anxiously
flipping through a newspaper on cell phone

EMMA
(into cell as needed)
No I don’t see it -- hang on --

I‘m in the wrong section --

Emma throws aside a mess of newspapers Mari smiles
rolls her eyes -- Emma mouths “I know” as she brings up
another section --

EMMA (CONTD)
Here found it --

MARI
(quietly)
Thank god --

Emma playfully squints at Mari As Mari glances at Emma

we notice a sidebar COLUMN on the front page of the paper
Emma’s reading KRUG’S MUGSHOT with the headline INMATE
ESCAPES TWO MORE SUSPECTS AT LARGE

EMMA
(re ad in newspaper)
Yeah I see it now You’re right
the price is wrong No problem
I‘ll have ‘em correct it and tell
them to forget charging us Bye

Emma flips the phone shut stuffs the newspaper in her
bag next to a stash of magazines Emma sighs

MARI
You on vacation now

EMMA
I’m on vacation now

We suddenly hear SNORING 0S Mari turns to see John
curled up in the back seat still wearing scrubs (fresh
ones) and sleeping like a baby Mari rolls her eyes at
Emma

EMMA (CONTD)
I know

Another snore Emma nudges John --

MARI
Dad --

JOHN

(acting groggy)
Whaa purple elephant

EMMA
Jesus

JOHN
Are we there yet

MARI
Making the turn now

Just as Mari slows to make the turn down a narrower side
road she notices an old rickety sign posted across from
the narrower road’s entrance THE LAKE ENDS IN THE ROAD -
1 MI

MARI (CONTD)
Jeez you’d think somebody would
change that sign

EMMA
I like it Tells me the turn’s
coming up

MARI
Fine but it makes no sense

EMMA
Of course it does You keep going
straight you eventually hit the
water

MARI
The ROAD ends in the LAKE A lake
does not END in a ROAD

JOHN
(still lying in back
seat arm over his
face)
Mari stop stressing you’re on
vacation

MARI
With the dreaded parents
Exactly Stress is foregone

JOHN

I’ve got some good drugs for that
EMMA

John --
JOHN

It’s the last house on the left
in case you forgot

MARI
It’s the only house for miles
dad

JOHN

I was being ironical for god’s
sake I’m going back to sleep

EMMA
Good maybe you can dream up some
new material

THEIR POV - THROUGH THE SUV’S WINDSHIELD - Mari turns
into a gravel driveway just ahead of a forest-bordered
dead end

EXT COLLINGWOOD HOUSE - DRIVEWAY —- DAY - CONTINUOUS

We follow the SUV as it makes its way up the long
driveway until a two-story home comes into view behind
the trees Decent size Could use a fresh coat of
paint but otherwise

MARI
The place looks pretty good

The SUV rolls to a stop in the back of the house Mari
and Emma hop out Take in the silence Mari looks
around eyes the GUEST HOUSE just off the driveway on the
opposite side

MARI (CONT’D)
You guys fixed up the guest house
EMMA
(nodding)
About three months ago when you
were training I came up and did
a few things before Uncle Dan got

here
MARI
Oh that’s right how long did
he stay
EMMA
About a week Him and another
couple
John gets out
JOHN

(re guesthouse)
Water pressure still sucks
though

MARI
I don’t care can I have it

Surprised beat Then --

EMMA
(trying not to show
disappointment)
You want to sleep in the
guesthouse

JOHN
Of course she does it’s the
perfect getaway from the getaway
with the “dreaded parents”

MARI
Hey I’m looking out for all
involved parties

EMMA
-- It’s all yours

INT GUEST HOUSE - BEDROOM —- SHORT TIME LATER

Mari enters lugging a suitcase and her duffel bag She
rolls the suitcase aside drops the duffel to the floor
with a THUD

She falls back to the bed Eyes the ceiling fan Deep
breath Trying to let herself relax to be still for a
-- nope not gonna happen She jumps up heads to the
suitcase starts unpacking JUMP CUT

- Mari hangs a couple of dresses in the closet

- Takes out a jewelry box picks out a few select pieces
puts them on the bedside table a couple of bracelets
watch and a gold-chain necklace A small medallion --
resembling a miniature gold medal -- hangs from it Mari

Mari rubs a finger tip across it then sets it on the
table

INT COLLINGWOOD HOUSE - DAY

John and Emma carry their luggage through the kitchen
into the living room through to the foyer and up the

top of the stairs on the

SECOND FLOOR LANDING

John hangs a right heads down the hall --

EMMA
Hey you --

John turns back sees Emma still standing at the stairs --
EMMA (CONTD)

How ‘bout you try bunking with me
for a change

JOHN
Em You know I don’t sleep I
just toss and turn

EMMA
Wait wait you misunderstood
You can sleep anywhere you want

John smiles heads back her way Emma stops him with a
gentle but firm hand on the arm

EMMA (CONT’D)
I’m glad we’re here

JOHN
(mostly sincere)
Me too
(trying to reassure)
We’ll get there

EMMA
(gently)
We are getting there One day at
a time

JOHN
Yeah

Emma smiles then leans in for a kiss John returns the
gesture Then he drops his bag and pulls her in for a
tight playful squeeze -- Emma giggles pretends to choke
as John lifts her off the floor then WINCES in pain --

JOHN (CONT‘D)
Ooh -- back --

Emma smacks him on the shoulder thinks he’s making a
statement about her weight but --

JOHN (CONTD)
Em I’m not kidding --

EXT COLLINGWOOD HOUSE - DAY - SHORT TIME LATER

Mari heads down a narrow path through the woods It

leads to their boat house and private dock on the

sparkling lake beyond

EXT LAKE - BOAT HOUSEDOCK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Mari heads on to the dock pokes her head in the boat
house

A small ski boat covered with a dusty tarp docked inside
quietly bobbing on the water in this enclosed floating
garage-like room

Mari steps back out heads to the end of the dock takes
in the gorgeous scenery the massive lake surrounded
by dense forest the entirety of its surface curving out
of view through the woodlands

A few very distant houses dot its circumference with
large patches of wilderness between them

A ski boat and skier suddenly race past paying little
heed to that “NO WAKE” BUOY anchored about a hundred
yards out Mari eyes the buoy She can’t resist

SMASH TO

EXT LAKE - DAY - SECONDS LATER

Mari butterflies full on for the buoy Reaches out
SLAMS her hand down on it Turns her wrist over eyes
her watch clicks the “stop” button This time Mari
smiles

INT GUEST HOUSE - BATHROOM SHOWER —- DAY

Mari attempts to cleanse her naked young body with the
crappy water pressure But she doesn’t seem to mind
JUMP CUT

Mari turns the water off yanks the shower curtain aside
One end of the shower rod suddenly POPS loose and falls

MARI
Shit --

Mari fumbles to put it back into place -- but the fitting
on the tile wall is coming loose little bits of plaster
falling into the tub

Mari finally succeeds in getting the rod back in place --
but barely

She steps out of the tub and very very gently pulls the
curtain closed --

INT GUEST HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Mari slips into bra and underwear Bermuda shorts a

fresh lime green tank top Pulls hair back a little

Eyes the jewelry on the bedside table opts for the

necklace her brother gave her

INT COLLINGWOOD HOUSE —- KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

Mari enters to find Emma putting supplies and groceries

away

the items on the counter

John chooses not to hear that
intent on doing surgery on the microwave’s innards

MARI
This doesn’t look like relaxation
to me

JOHN
I‘ll be relaxed once I get this
friggin piece of pre-historic junk
out of my sight

MARI
(a playful dig)
Is it plugged in

EMMA
He didn’t hear you

JOHN
I‘m ignoring her

MARI
Do you need the car I was gonna
head into town and see Paige

EMMA
Oh yeah You talked to her

MARI
She finally texted me back I
guess she works at her dad‘s ice
cream store

EMMA
Huh Well good Oh hey you

you’re at it I forgot some
breakfast stuff

MARI

Grabs a screwdriver

We note a small household FIRE EXTINGUISHER among
We PAN TO REVEAL John trying
to pull the microwave from its dock above the stove
EMMA
Here’s the list --

MARI
By the way I’m pretty sure I just
broke my hundred meter record out
in the lake

EMMA
Oh that’s great sweetie Did

He’s still focused on the microwave -- peering in

circuitry
somewhere

John SLAMS the microwave door

John hands

He flips a switch inside the casing

Eyes them innocently

Emma grabs John’s wallet takes out the rest of his cash
hands it to Mari

EMMA
Have fun

Mari smiles pecks John on the cheek heads out

EXT TOWN SQUARE - DAY

A statue sits in the middle of the square surrounded by
the modest church a rundown mini-mart an old
firehouse

A smattering of local CITIZENS mill about in the little
shops as Mari drives the SUV up to the curb just outside
the mini-mart She hops out clicks on the car alarm
steps to the curb Approaches the window of a clothing
shop eyeing the summer dresses

MARI
(to herself)
Those are so cute

PAIGE (0S)
Mari Collingwood

Mari spins around to see PAIGE 17 a stunning beauty
even when wearing the required uniform of the ice cream
shop she’s leaning out of neon pink apron black slacks
polo shirt

MARI
Hey Oh my god --

Mari crosses the street hugs Paige

MARI (CONT’D)

fantastic --

PAIGE
Like the hair

MARI
Oh yeah I really --

PAIGE
Tell me inside c’mon --

MARI

don’t want to keep you --

Paige turns around to the very empty ice cream shop

PAIGE
Oh Well yeah you’re right I do
have to draw up a report on the
quarterly “crazy cone” sales and
get it to New York in time for the
annual stock holders meeting

MARI
I can totally come back later --

PAIGE
Mari

MARI
Yes

PAIGE

Get in the damn store

INT ICE CREAM SHOP —- DAY - SHORT TIME LATER

Mari and Paige sit at the table by the window Mari
takes a final lick of her mint-chocolate chip that sits
atop a squiggly-shaped waffle cone aka the crazy cone
Mari considers it

MARI
Wow This cone’s

PAIGE

be So far I’ve calculated I’ve
spent 184 and a half days of my
life making those things So

MARI
As good as they can be I guess

Mari smiles A beat Then --

PAIGE (CONTD)
(delicately)
Listen Mari I was so -- I
couldn’t believe it when I heard
about your brother --

MARI
Yeah me neither

PAIGE
I‘m so sorry for not getting in
touch I’m so bad about that
stuff I just --

MARI
Paige don’t even worry about it
We’re dealing you know That’s
why we decided -- well actually
it’s my mom who decided to come
back up here this summer to try
to get back to I don’t know
some kind of normalcy You ask
me this was exactly the place not
to come no offense

PAIGE
Hey I don’t have a special place
in my heart for this hole I’m
outta here first chance I get

MARI
I‘m just an advocate for moving on
to new things making new
memories does that make sense

PAIGE

It does if you can do it So you
should come over tonight My
dad’s at my aunt’s till tomorrow

(with a mischievous

smirk)
Got the whole place to mine own

Mari’s cell phone RINGS

MARI
(into phone)
Hey mom -- Yeah I’m with
Paige Yeah -- yeah she looks
great were catching up -- Say
that again -- you’re breaking up

-- There you are --

Over the above Paige’s attention drifts she’s now
curiously eyeing something outside over Mari’s shoulder

PAIGE’S POV - A LANKY KID - walking on the sidewalk
wearing a grey sweatshirt hood over his head

MARI (CONT’D)

So Mom I’m gonna hang out with
Paige for awhile probably go to
her house so it could be kinda
late

(then for Paiges

benefit)
Yes mom if the storm’s too
intense Ill just spend the night
Yeah and I’1ll pick up the stuff
in the morning on the way home --
Okay I will -- Love you too

(hangs up to Paige)
What are you looking at

PAIGE
There is this semi-mysterious
pretty good looking unabomber
wannabe dude walking on the
sidewalk over there

Mari turns -- sees the guy meandering along --

MARI
Do you know him

PAIGE
(shaking a “no” faux
western accent)
He ain’t from these here parts

MARI
Neither am I

PAIGE
True but you also didn’t cover
the same fifty-foot stretch of
concrete twelve times in five
minutes We’re definitely being
surveilled or -- is that the right
word “surveilled”

MARI
(still peering out
window)
It’s “surveyed” I think --

Mari turns back -- Paige is gone Now standing outside
the ice cream shop’s door waving a crazy cone yelling
over at the unabomber dude

PAIGE
Excuse me sir

The guy looks over

PAIGE (CONTD)
Yes you sir Would you like to
try a crazy cone

Mari watches the guy He pauses

PAIGE (CONTD)
On the house You don’t like it
I‘ll give you your money back

The guy breaks a smile Mari eyes him closely as he
crosses the street

TIME CUT TO

INT ICE CREAM SHOP —- DAY - SHORT TIME LATER

Our unabomber guy has now joined Paige and Mari at the
table Call him JUSTIN His hood pulled back now

PAIGE

Justin looks up meeting Paige’s eyes for the first time

JUSTIN
She died

looking guilty Awkward beat Then

PAIGE
Alright this is gonna sound tacky

Mari can’t believe it puts her hand to her forehead
Justin on the other hand breaks an amused smile and
little chuckle

PAIGE (CONTD)
Now he’s laughing Even better

JUSTIN
Because you’re you say what

of this run-down lodge Paige and Justin hop out amidst
stronger gusts of wind and a distant ROLL of thunder

Paige smiles as she grabs Justin’s hand and leads him
toward the rooms

WITH MARI - HER POV - Paige and Justin disappear inside
the room partially closing the door behind them

Mari watches intently Then nervously shuffles through
radio stations All static Checks her cell phone No
signal

Another beat No movement from the room Mari shakes
her head Eyes fall on the grocery list Picks it up
studies it Milk Orange juice eggs

Mari looks back toward the room Still nothing She
exhales more frustrated Turns to get out of the SUV
just as --

A HAND

Suddenly RAPS on the window WHACK WHACK WHACK Scaring
the shit out of us But it’s just the old lady MAID

MAID
Sorry So sorry ma‘am

MARI
That’s okay -- that’s --

A shaken Mari realizes she’s still in the car talking
through the window The maid can’t hear her Mari opens
the door steps out into the windstorm The Maid holds
up a room key

MAID
I find This belong you

MARI
No no Sorry

MAID
Is okay Sorry I scare

MARI
Youre fine

The maid smiles pockets the key pushes her cart away
across the lot disappears behind the motel office

Mari turns back heads down the walkway As she
approaches we note the LOCAL newspaper lying outside the
door KRUG’S MUG SHOT IS PLASTERED ON THE FRONT PAGE with
the headline “FUGITIVE ON THE LOOSE” We TILT UP as
Mari knocks on the door and pushes her way into

INT MOTEL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

-where we reveal Justin and Paige sitting on the bed
smoking a j

MARI
What the hell you two

They look over Not too bothered at the intrusion
PAIGE

Mari Justin wasn’t bullshitting
This is some premium shit

MARI
I’m happy for you I’m leaving

PAIGE

Mari turns back

MARI
Paige I told you I’m not in to
this anymore It’s fine you two

later I’m here three months --

PAIGE

No screw that we’re going

We’re going -- where’s my purse --
MARI

How could you have lost your purse

already --

As Mari helps Paige root for her purse Justin looks up
to see

KRUG SADIE AND FRANCIS

Step into the doorway carrying bags of groceries
Justin’s eyes go wide --

JUSTIN
(to himself)
Shit --
MARI
(finding the purse)
Here

PAIGE
(to Mari still not
seeing Krug et al)
You’1l give me a ride home still
right

KRUG (0S)
Sure she can It’s no problem

Mari and Paige whirl around
KRUG FRANCIS AND SADIE
are still standing in the doorway their eyes scanning

the faces of the people they didn’t expect to be here
Justin Paige Mari

Note Krug has the newspaper from outside tucked under
his arm

FRANCIS
What the hell is this
(to Justin re Mari
and Paige)
What the fuck did you do

Over this a strong gust of wind blows through the room

KRUG
Francis

FRANCIS
What

KRUG

There’s a draft

Francis SLAMS the door shut Krug turns back glares
daggers at Justin

KRUG (CONT’D)
Clearly you got your brains from
your mother --

JUSTIN

for some weed You weren’t
supposed to be here --

KRUG
(deadpan)
Surprise
MARI

girlfriend Sadie

SADIE

Mari nods

SADIE (CONT’D)

MARI
I didn’t -- I didn’t buy it

FRANCIS
So it’s Mommy and Daddy’s

Mari eyes them a beat Clearly sensing the trouble
brewing

MARI
Yes

Sadie eyes Mari in amused disgust

SADIE
I like that necklace too Your
parents just give you everything
your little heart desires I bet
don’t they

KRUG
Sadie manners Don’t rush to
judge It’s rude
(back to Mari re
Sadie)
She’s been stressing a little this
morning

SADIE
I think we have good reason --

FRANCIS
We sure as hell do

KRUG
(seeing Mari and
Paige’s questioning
looks)
I’m sorry Mari and Paige
(MORE)

KRUG (CONTD)
What they’re referring to is the
fact my son here has unknowingly
or unwittingly or just very
stupidly backed us all into
somewhat of a corner here

PAIGE
We only smoked half of one -- we
can pay you

MARI
We have money

KRUG
I don’t doubt that Mari but it’s
not quite that simple

Krug nonchalantly holds up the newspaper points to his

photo

KRUG (CONT’D)
Good looking guy don’t you think

Paige and Mari’s eyes widen Justin looks at his father

in disbelief

JUSTIN
What -- what is that What did
you do now

KRUG
Well oh son of mine your old man
got himself in a few more spots of
trouble in his absence

PAIGE
Jesus Christ

KRUG
--our Lord and Savior wasn’t
gonna help me this time Paige so
I had to resort to other means of
redemption which Sadie and Francis
here were kind enough to
facilitate

MARI
Listen Mr Krug --

Krug Francis and Sadie chuckle at that --

KRUG
Krug’s my first name sweetheart
But I still appreciate you being
polite It’ll getcha places
MARI
This is clearly none of our
business We won’t --

KRUG
Won’t what

MARI
This isn’t our business --

KRUG
So you’re saying it’s a private
matter

MARI
Absolutely

KRUG

So even though my mug’s now
plastered all over the front page
of every newspaper on every street
corner of this shithole little
berg what you’re really saying

is
Mari’s frozen -- Krug presses
KRUG (CONT’‘D)
Is
MARI
I‘m saying we won’t tell
anyone
KRUG

Ah you won’t rat us out I don’t
know Frank you believe her

FRANCIS
Yeah I think maybe I do

SADIE
I don’t

PAIGE
Well you should We don’t care
We don’t give a shit really --

KRUG
Calm down Paige

PAIGE
But I swear we won’t --

KRUG
Paige shush

SADIE
What do you wanna do Krug

A beat Krug stares at Mari in intense unreadable
silence for a moment Mari swallows nervously as Paige
looks ill and Justin looks worried

KRUG
I want Mari to give me her keys
SADIE
Cool that’1ll solve our car
issues
KRUG

(explaining to Mari)
We blew a head gasket on the way
back

Mari instantly reaches in her pocket hands them over

MARI
It’s yours

KRUG
I accept

PAIGE

So we can leave now You can just
take the car and we’re not gonna
say anything --

KRUG
Sorry Paige We can’t take that
chance

PAIGE
What --

MARI

Paige just stay calm
But Paige is way beyond it now Trembling Eyes darting
to -- the bathroom Beckoning Is there light coming
from a window inside

A tense beat -- and then -- Paige bolts

FRANCIS
Goddammit

Francis is closest He barrels after Paige who SLAMS and
LOCKS the bathroom door in his face

INT BATHROOM — DAY —- CONTINUOUS

Paige heads for the small window next to the shower
Hands shaking as she tries to lift it But this thing
hasn’t been opened in years

PAIGE
HELP HELP US SOMEBODY

She fumbles for her cell phone as --

OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM - FRANCIS

Tries to bust down the door No go He turns to Krug
who tosses him Sadie’s silenced PISTOL Francis FIRES it
into the lock --

WITH PAIGE

Cell phone pressed to her ear using her other hand to
force the dry-rotted window open a couple of inches
still SCREAMING as

FRANCIS

Suddenly SLAMS through the door --

PAIGE (CONT’D)
No No

Francis grabs a fistful of Paige’s hair yanks her back
and SLAMS her forehead into the edge of the sink She
drops to the floor Out cold

Francis stands there trembling from the adrenaline rush

ON KRUG - turning to Sadie whos still peeking out the
window

KRUG
Anything

SADIE
Not that I can see

Krug turns back locks eyes with the silent Mari whos
trying her best to keep calm the tears in check

KRUG
Thanks for being cool about this
Mari

Krug shifts his gaze back to Francis as he steps out from
the bathroom

KRUG (CONTD)
What’s going on in there

FRANCIS
Knocked her silly but she’s
coming around

Krug tosses the car keys to Francis

KRUG
Back Mari’s SUV up to the door
close as you can

SADIE
(re Mari and Paige)
Shouldn’t we ask them if somebody
will be looking for them

KRUG
Like worried mommies and daddies
ex-boyfriends

SADIE
Yeah like that

KRUG
(shaking a “no”)
I think that’s a given Sade The
only thing it changes is our
average speed the hell out of
here

Francis heads out the door Sadie starts throwing their
stuff into grocery bags as Krug turns back to Mari whos
now glaring at Justin Justin feels her stare but
refuses to make eye contact Krug observes this

KRUG (CONT’D)
No you look at her Justin

No movement Krug gets up grabs Justin‘’s chin -- hard --
gets in his son’s face

KRUG (CONT’D)
You know there’s a lot of
different kinds of days that come
out of nowhere that force you to
grow up You might think it’s the
day your mom met her maker but
let me assure you my son that
pales in comparison to this day
(MORE )

KRUG (CONT’D)
I‘ll let that pre-pubescent brain
of yours try to figure out why
But in the meantime I’1ll give you
a clue LOOK AT HER
Krug viciously yanks Justin’s head toward Mari

KRUG (CONTD)
Look at --

JUSTIN
Okay okay --

Justin eyes Mari A tear streams down his face as his
eyes shift back to his father

JUSTIN (CONT’D)
Just let them --

KRUG
Ahhp -- what did I say
off this Krug nearly squeezing the life out of Justin
through his jaw bone -- as we hear another distant ROLL
OF THUNDER

CUT TO

EXT FOREST ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

The SUV drives down a winding forest road

INT SUV - MOVING -— CONTINUOUS

Krug drives with Justin in the passenger seat In the
back Mari and a still groggy Paige -- a gash on her
forehead -- sit crunched between Sadie and Francis
random possessions piled messily behind them

Silence Krug looks over at Justin

KRUG
Put your seat-belt on

Justin obeys

KRUG’S POV - Seen in the rearview mirror another SUV
passing them

Mari yearningly watches it go by out the side-window
A MOTHER and FATHER (30s) are in the front As the SUV

starts to get ahead of them a cute LITTLE GIRL looks out
the back window

Mari and the Little Girl lock eyes The Girl smiles
Mari instinctively manages a weak smile in return

The other SUV speeds away taking Mari’s view of the
Little Girl with it She stares after it wistfully her
smile fading

Her gaze shifts back to the car and she notices the
backseat’s CIGARETTE LIGHTER by the cup-holders in front
of her Stares at it

EXTINT FOREST ROADSUV - MOMENTS LATER

The SUV approaches a fork in the road

KRUG
Left right

FRANCIS
Right

KRUG

(irritated)
Right meaning “correct” or right
meaning “go right”

FRANCIS
No the way to the park entrance
is left Right takes you to the
lake

KRUG
You’re sure

FRANCIS
Pretty much

Krug glares not satisfied

SADIE
I coulda swore it was right Krug

ON MARI - she’s been taking this all in -- her mind
racing -- she finally opts to speak up --

MARI

(to Krug)
No left is correct

(off their glares)
I’ve been coming here for years
The way to the national park
the National Forest Park -- If
that’s what you meant --

Over the above Mari inches
HER FOOT
up and presses the cigarette lighter in

KRUG
It is what I meant

MARI
Then you need to go left

Krug studies Mari’s face in the rearview She looks
sincere enough -- if not it’s a damn good bluff A
beat Then -- Krug turns left

CU - MARI - her face betrays the slightest hint of “holy
shit he bought it”

Her eyes FLICK back to that cigarette lighter as an
impenetrable wall of trees stream by on either side of
the vehicle

She swallows anxiously and looks out the window sees
something 0S that we DON’T SEE

MARI (CONTD)
(mouthing to herself)

Shit --
(mouthing to the
cigarette lighter)
Come -- on --
PLINK The cigarette lighter POPS OUT -- ready --

Mari instantly snatches it before Sadie can react and
JAMS the burning hot end into her face

Sadie SCREAMS IN PAIN and recoils against the seat as
Mari fumbles to climb over her opening the door --

FRANCIS
(panicking)
Fuck

Francis hurls himself across Paige and Sadie to grab Mari
as she frantically reaches for the back door handle --

KRUG
What the fu --

SMACK Paige kicks Krug in the face --

EXT FOREST ROAD —- DAY - CONTINUOUS

The SUV SWERVES as Mari and Paige SCREAM -- Mari’s now
trying to push the back door OPEN

INT SUV - DAY - CONTINUOUS - MOVING

JUSTIN
Dad look out

Krug looks ahead sees they’ve crossed the center line
heading for a sharp turn --

KRUG
SHIT

Krug SLAMS ON THE BRAKES yanks the wheel hard left but
over corrects --
EXT FOREST ROAD - CONTINUOUS

The SUV SCREECHES across the pavement and tumbles off the
road into the woods --

INSIDE THE SUV - Blood-curdling SCREAMS as it rolls end
over end down the incline --

MARI falls back inside the SUV as --
WHAM It SMASHES into a tree miraculously UPRIGHT

Silence No movement A long beat as steam HISSES from
the busted engine

Quiet Bordering on peaceful even -- until finally --

One of the back doors opens and Paige falls out onto the
ground She looks up blinking and dazed but unhurt

She rises unsteadily to her feet -
BAM Krug KNOCKS HER DOWN -
She looks up in fear as he towers over her angrily --

IN THE SUV’S PASSENGER SEAT - a foggy-looking Justin rubs
his head his deflated airbag deployed

A back-door opens and Francis groggily emerges moaning
His nose has been broken and it’s a bloody mess Krug
sees it cringes --

KRUG
You all right

Francis groans and raises a hand to his nose He bends to
examine his reflection in the SUV’s side-mirror Anger
bubbles across his face as he eyes his ruined visage

FRANCIS
Motherf--

He turns to see Mari stumble from the rear left passenger
door of the SUV dazed and unsteady

FRANCIS (CONTD)
You little bitch

Francis strides to Mari and SLAPS her across the face
knocking her to the ground next to Paige

BAM He KICKS Mari in the stomach and she CRIES OUT the
wind knocked out of her COUGHING

PAIGE
(horrified)
No

Sadie emerges from the SUV a hand held to the small red
burn-mark on her face

KRUG
You okay

SADIE
Do I look o-fucking-kay

Sadie’s about to pounce on Mari but pauses as she sees
her possessions scattered across the ground

SADIE (CONT’D)
(angering)
Oh no no no

She hurries forward to grab some clothing from the
dirt

SADIE (CONT’D)
Look at all my shit This is
everything I own

Sadie uncovers the silenced PISTOL in the debris Picks
it up charges for Mari --

SADIE (CONTD)
You think you can just fuck
everything up for us and get away
with it

Sadie wrenches Mari’‘s head back by the hair presses the
pistol to her head

SADIE (CONT’D)
Do you

Sadie gets right in close to the terrified girl

SADIE (CONT’D)
This is what you get

Sadie suddenly smiles then lets go of Mari and turns to
Francis

SADIE (CONT’D)
She’s all yours

Francis nods hungrily

FRANCIS
I was afraid you were gonna make
me flip for it

Francis approaches Mari leans down to grab her up when --
BAM Paige snatches up a nearby heavy rotted branch and
HITS Francis in his busted nose --

Francis SCREAMS in agony as Paige leaps to her feet and
TAKES OFF like a shot into the forest --

Francis charges after Paige like a mad bull Sadie turns
to Krug who just stares at her clearly irritated at
their incompetence --

KRUG
Bring -- her -- back -- here

Sadie frantically hurries to follow Francis and the
fleeing Paige

ON KRUG - he watches them go Royally pissed Looks
down at Mari stares straight through her

IN THE FOREST —- PAIGE

dashes as fast as she can HOWLING like a wild animal
Francis is fifty feet behind -

FRANCIS
YOURE DEAD BITCH DEAD

Paige glances over her shoulder in terror sees Francis
gaining on her and Sadie not far behind him --

She whimpers in fear and pushes herself even harder --

Paige disappears from his vision as the terrain dips and
she heads down a hill She stumbles down the steep
incline leaping over logs obstacles suddenly TRIPS
on a rock CRIES OUT as she sprains her ankle FALLING
forward now TUMBLING and ROLLING down the hill toward

A SLIGHT CLIFF

Paige SHRIEKS as she FALLS off the edge and DROPS five
feet to flat ground

Quickly recovering she scurries back into a SHALLOW
HOLLOW in the side of the cliff hiding herself from
view

CU - PAIGE - breathing hard trying to stay calm as --

PAIGE’S POV - BAM - FRANCIS lands on the ground five
feet in front of her charging forward to run off through
the woods clueless that he just passed her -

THUD Paige flinches as Sadie does the same following
Francis in their blind pursuit of no one --

Paige watches with wide panicked eyes as her pursuers
disappear from view She quickly emerges from her hiding
place gritting her teeth as she hobbles as fast as she
can on her sprained ankle as --

FURTHER INTO THE WOODS - FRANCIS AND SADIE - slowed to a
jog now looking around as they see no sign of Paige

FRANCIS (CONTD)
Shit You go that way

Sadie heads in a different direction

WITH PAIGE - hobbling through the forest she sees a road
just up ahead through the trees a couple of cars
passing

BAM Sadie suddenly TACKLES her from behind taking her
down Paige SCREAMS struggles as Sadie holds her down --

PAIGE
(screaming)
HELP HELP ME

SADIE
(out of breath)
Take it easy TAKE IT EASY I
can help you I can get you out
of this

Paige’s hand gropes at her side frantically searching
for a weapon It closes on a large ROCK

PAIGE
Fuck you

SMACK Paige SLAMS the rock against the side of Sadie’s
head knocking her away

Paige quickly stumbles to her feet whirls around only to
come face to face with Francis --

FRANCIS
Back atcha Paige

He cold cocks her KNOCKING her senseless Paige hits
the ground Francis grabs the gun out of Sadie’s waist
band aims at Paige --

SADIE
No --

FRANCIS
No

SADIE

Krug wants us to bring her back

TIME CUT TO

EXT FOREST - CRASH SITE —- DAY - SHORT TIME LATER

Paige her wrists tied with pieces of her now shredded
shirt is thrown to the ground next to Mari Krug is
still glaring just as we left him intense uncertainty
raging in his eyes

Sadie and Francis stare at him expectantly Justin
stands in the bg Too terrified to move as

PAIGE AND MARI

sit on the ground at their feet passive in their
traumatized state

FRANCIS
What now

Krug doesn’t respond

KRUG’S POV - He looks from Francis to Sadie to the girls
and his wandering gaze comes to rest on Justin who’s
staring at the ground

Sensing this Justin looks up at Krug looking uneasy at
being the focus of his father’s attention

KRUG
(to Justin)
You wanna finally be a man

Unnerved at this question Justin glances at Francis and
Sadie finding no help Krug gestures to Mari

KRUG (CONT’D)
There’s your chance She’s all
yours

Justin and Mari freeze their eyes widening in panic
Justin looks down at Mari in fear She looks back
equally afraid

KRUG (CONT‘D)
What are you gay

Krug quickly walks forward and grabs Justin by the arm
shaking the terrified kid --

PAIGE You’re pathetic

Krug turns to look down at Paige in surprise She stares
back at him with cold eyes her tears gone now a strange
confidence on her face She doesn’t care anymore

KRUG
What did you say to me

MARI
Paige --

But Paige isn’t listening She rises unsteadily to
confront Krug unafraid

PAIGE
I said you’re pathetic

Krug steps forward gets in her face stares at her in
silence as Paige smiles her anger building

PAIGE (CONTD)
What You gonna hit me Go
ahead Hit me you piece of shit

Krug GLARES another tense beat Then a smile creeps
across his face He chuckles

KRUG
Why does everybody eventually come
around to calling me that
(back to Paige)
No honey I’m not gonna hit you
I’m not quite that predictable

Paige suddenly GASPS flinching --

Justin Mari Sadie and Francis all flinch as well
their eyes wide

Paige blinks in stunned surprise instantly dazed

PAIGE’S POV - She slowly looks down from Krug’s face
He’s driven a SWITCHBLADE deep into her stomach only its
handle visible in his hand as BLOOD leaks out around it

Paige looks back up at Krug in dumb silence the pure
shock on her face slowly giving way to pain as her eyes
moisten her mouth gaping open in a soundless scream

Krug wrenches the switchblade out and Paige grunts in
pain Still in shock she stumbles backward unsteadily
her hands clutched to her bloody wound

She collides with Sadie for support Sadie shoves Paige
back down next to Mari --

MARI
Paige -- Paige -- breathe -- try
to breathe --

Krug looks over at Justin and sees that he’s CRYING
softly tears running down his face

Rage suddenly floods Krug’s face as he watches his son’s
weakness

Krug turns back to Mari and Paige Paige is coughing
spitting up blood now her life slipping away

KRUG
(to Mari)
What is wrong with you Mari
Can’t you see that Paige is very
worried -- and rightfully so --
that today is the last day of her
life So comfort her

Mari still keeps holding Paige but doesn’t respond to
Krug

KRUG (CONTD)
Mari tell Paige that everything
is gonna be all right

PAIGE
No -- Mari -- don’t --

KRUG
Say it

Mari eyes Paige and the defiance that still remains in
her dying eyes

PAIGE
-- Don’t -- don’t say it Mari --

Mari forces the tears back --

MARI
Okay Okay --

KRUG
SAY IT

Mari turns and glares up at Krug --

MARI
No

She looks back down to Paige who manages the slightest
hint of a thankful smile Then -- her breathing fades
and she becomes perfectly limp and motionless in Mari’s
arms her slumped face hidden beneath her hair

Mari looks back up to see an enraged

KRUG

Suddenly towering over her his eyes wide with crazed
FURY as he throws Paige aside and grabs Mari --

MARI (CONT’D)
NO -- YOU -- PLEASE NO --

With a tidal wave of utter contempt and sadistic rage
Krug suddenly shoves Mari to the ground and starts
VICIOUSLY TEARING AT HER CLOTHES

KRUG
(hard in Mari’s face
as he rips at her
clothes)
You think -- you can keep fucking
me whenever you please --

MARI
NO I don’t -- I don’t --

Krug continues to tear at her clothes shredding her tank
top ripping her bra off --

KRUG
You don’t You don’t think that

MARI
No -- NO -- please --

KRUG
Mari doesn’t think that you two

ON SADIE

Youd think she might protest but instead she seems
oddly captivated bordering on turned on by what Krug is
doing to Mari

SADIE
Then she’s a liar Look around
Look what she did She does think
that So you gotta make it clear
-- It goes both ways

KRUG
You hear that Mari Sadie says
it goes both ways

Mari screams as Krug shoves her head in the damp earth
muffling the sound

Mari tries to crawl away but Krug puts his full weight
on the small of her back as he starts yanking at her
shorts

MARI’S HANDS

CLAW at the earth as Krug pulls her shorts and underwear
down

ON MARI

She lifts her head up locks eyes with a frozen Justin --

MARI
Justin -- please -- help me --
FRANCIS

You stay right there Justin

Justin backs away tears streaming He presses up

against a tree then slinks to the ground -- and turns
away
CU - MARI - Her eyes stream with tears as Krug -- OS --

thrusts at her from behind savagely
Sadie watches Wide-eyed Psychotically mesmerized
Francis’ eyes are more uncertain Yet he remains still

MARI
Please no

ON MARI - HER EYES

Suddenly grow cold almost lifeless as if she’s giving
in her body going limp in surrender until --

HER GOLD CHAIN
falls into frame -- clinging to her muddy cheek -- the

gold medallion -- in soft focus -- sliding its way
forward from 08

Mari’s eyes shift to it for a beat -- her hand starts to
grab at it -- Krug sees this
KRUG

What you want that Well you
can’t have it

He RIPS it off her neck

MARI
No No no

KRUG
Yes Yes Yes

Krug tosses the necklace to Justin who lets it land in
the dirt beside him

SADIE
(to Justin re
necklace)
Hey you don’t want that I‘1l
take it

Justin stares at her Then grabs the necklace gently
puts it in his jeans pocket as --

CU - MARI - she turns her head forward peering ahead of
her into the woods as the PAIN becomes overwhelming
forcing

HER OUTSTRETCHED ARM AND HAND

to claw at the earth in agony clinging to it her
fingertips disappearing an inch down where they suddenly
come into contact with something SOLID

ON MARI - her eyes react to the sensation the slightest
tinge of hope and determination re-emerging if only for
an instant as --

HER MUD-CAKED FINGERTIPS

Start scraping away faster and faster to expose --
only to us -- a good-size ROCK whose purpose has come

ON KRUG - He finishes -- catches his breath for a beat --
then pulls himself off Mari He steps aside starts
pulling his pants up as he locks eyes with Justin

KRUG
You could have stopped me I
would’ve let you

Mari suddenly gets to her knees convulses -- doubles
over coughing She looks over locks eyes with Justin
who looks away Krug heads over kneels down to Mari

KRUG (CONT’D)
Still think you can fuck me any
time

Mari doesn’t answer Blankly stares off toward the lake -
- her spirit all but broken

MARI
(soft to herself)
I swim love to swim

KRUG
I‘m happy for you

MARI
(practically mumbling
this)
I can do it can do itone
more try mom

Krug and Sadie trade a slightly weirded-out look as
MARI’S FIST CLENCHES THAT ROCK - TIGHT

SADIE
What can you do for mommy
sweetie One more try at what

Mari turns locks eyes with Sadie

MARI
(re Krug next to
her)
Fucking him

WHACK Mari spins and SLAMS the rock across Krug‘s
temple Bulls-eye

Mari pulls herself up and RUNS FULL ON for the lake

SADIE
Goddammit

Sadie raises the gun and fires The bullets SPLINTER
tree trunks as Mari runs past them

WITH KRUG

He staggers to his feet RIPS the gun from Sadie’s hand
and bolts after Mari

ON MARI

Looking back sees Krug racing after her Sadie and
Francis not far behind

She summons whatever strength she has left INCREASES HER
SPEED just 50 yards from the shoreline

ON KRUG - He FIRES again Misses Stops his pursuit
Takes a steadier aim and FIRES again

SMASH TO

INT COLLINGWOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

John looks up from a magazine hearing the distant POP of
gunfire He gets up slides the glass door open steps
out onto the screened-in

BACK PORCH

cu - JOHN - listening intently Silence

INTERCUT WITH

THE FOREST --

CU - MARI’S FACE —- TERROR-STRICKEN BUT DETERMINED TO
MAKE IT TO THE WATER TO SALVATION

BACK TO JOHN - stepping quietly outside staring off into
the woods almost as if sensing his daughter’s plight
as --

POP KRUG - running full on - FIRES again

WITH MARI - she’s 20 feet from the water 10 5
-- far enough

WIDER - MARI DIVES FOR HER LIFE Disappears under the
water

Krug reaches the shore halts his pursuit Waits for
Mari to surface He takes aim ready

Silence
where the hell is she THEN --
MARI

surfaces doing the fastest most full-on butterfly we‘ve
ever seen the water splashing around her making it
difficult for

KRUG

To get a clear view of her body He FIRES two shots
The bullets skip off the water next to Mari

KRUG
Fuck

He stops Watching her swim away Disbelief Sadie
runs up

SADIE
You’re not going after her

Krug glares

KRUG

Sadie my face is all over the
newspaper not a fucking Wheatie’s
box

(off Sadie’s look

re Mari swimming

away)
You think I can keep up with that
shit Fuck this Fuck her

Almost as if giving up Krug spins back toward the lake
and Mari and fires at her again -- if there’s ever a
shot that should miss it’s this one because Krug only
half-asses it But --

POP

ON MARI - in the shittiest timing in the history of
cinema -- on the upstroke to get her breath --

THE BULLET
Finds its mark The back of
MARI’S RIGHT SHOULDER

Suddenly -- and very SHOCKINGLY -- EXPLODES in a spray of

blood

BACK ON SADIE - She sees the spray of crimson in the
splashes around Mari

FRANCIS
Holy shit

KRUG
What

SADIE
You got her

KRUG

You’re shittin’ me
A surprised Krug turns back around focuses on Mari

THEIR POV - FAR OUT IN THE LAKE - Mari -- now flipped on
her back -- unmoving -- floating away on the current

BACK TO SCENE - KRUG - keeps his eyes on Mari

AERIAL POV - LOOKING DOWN ON MARI - as she floats away --
her wide open unblinking eyes staring up at THE
GATHERING STORM CLOUDS as a pool of dark red blood
expands out around her in the water

BACK TO KRUG SADIE AND FRANCIS

As the first drops of rain start to fall -- the first
FLASHES of lightning in the distant foothills

Krug tucks the gun in his waistband turns heads back
toward the forest and crash site as Sadie follows

TIME CUT TO

EXT FOREST — CRASH SITE — MOMENTS LATER

Krug Francis and Sadie make their way back up to the
crashed SUV Justin’s still sitting against the tree
staring at Paige’s body

SADIE
So Anybody know where the hell
we are

KRUG
Well

Krug looks over sees hints of a freshly “paved” trail
leading back up presumably toward the unseen road its
brush and small trees toppled and flattened by the SUV as
it tumbled to its final resting place

KRUG (CONT’D)
Looks like we’re just off the road
a tad

SADIE
Trust me it’s more than a tad

FRANCIS
Shouldn’t we bury her

KRUG
Along with the car Sure you go
ahead and do that Me and Sadie
are gonna find our way the hell
out of here

More lightning and thunder The storm’s closing in the
rain growing steadier as Krug eyes Justin

KRUG (CONTD)
Justin let’s go

The boy still just stares at Paige’s body in a daze as if
nothings changed oblivious to the rain

KRUG (CONT’D)
Justin are you coming or you just
gonna sit there and process

No response Krug charges over to Justin and grabs his
arm roughly pulls the limp boy to his feet and drags him
through the rain Francis and Sadie follow

EXT FOREST ROAD - EVENING — SHORT TIME LATER

Krug Francis Justin Sadie walking on the shoulder
We PULL BACK to reveal the “LAKE ENDS IN THE ROAD” SIGN
coming into frame as they approach Krug eyes it

FRANCIS
(sarcastic)
Oh that’s helpful

KRUG
(eyeing the wording)
Does that make any sense to you

FRANCIS
Yeah why

SADIE
(nodding 0OS)
That a house through there

Krug turns focuses his gaze through the trees lining the
narrow side road whose entrance they’re standing across
from They see the shimmer of lights on the front porch
and in the upstairs windows

FRANCIS
You’re right

to smile and light our way on

(re pouring rain)
---lovely lovely day

Off this

INT COLLINGWOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

ON the HISSING STATIC of a small TV It disappears as
the TV’s clicked off

John at the kitchen table tosses the remote aside his
half-eaten dinner in front of him eating alone The
sound of muted POUNDING RAIN is constant

John gets up heads to the sink peers out the window as
Emma enters

JOHN
Man I can’t remember the last
time we had one this bad

EMMA

Both John and Emma freeze for a moment and then look at
each other in surprise Then --

BANG BANG BANG on the door It’s urgent
JOHN
What the hell
INT FOYER - EVENING - MOMENTS LATER
The front door is opened to expose a soaking-wet Krug
standing outside his hands on the shoulders of a dazed

Justin standing in front of him

Francis and Sadie stand behind them in the downpour
Francis with a bloody piece of clothing held to his nose

EMMA
Oh my god --
KRUG
Hello hi um I think we just

rolled our car off the road --
CUT TO BLACK

JOHN (0S)

This is gonna hurt
INT KITCHEN - EVENING - LATER
CU - Francis’ bloody BUSTED NOSE FINGERS suddenly
appear and grab it twisting the cartilage back into

place with a sickening SNAP as fresh blood oozes out

FRANCIS
Jesus -- FUCK

WIDER - John sits next to Francis presses a towel to his
newly reset nose Emma’s in the bg making coffee

FRANCIS (CONTD)
Shit -- shit

JOHN
Calm down Deep breath Worst

FRANCIS
Deep breath deep breath --

Standing against the counter draped in towels Krug and
Sadie wince

KRUG
I was just saying to Sadie here a
little while ago that despite
everything we’re still having a
pretty lucky day first seeing
your house then you being a
doctor

John chuckles

JOHN
That I am but you still need to
get to a hospital All of you do

KRUG
Doc we don’t really have the best
health coverage right now

EMMA
Doesn’t matter Insurance or not
they still have to treat you

KRUG
Oh Well in that case Do you
think you could give us a lift

JOHN
Of course Only one problem --

EMMA
Our daughter has the car She’s
spending the night at a friend’s
Emma hands Krug a steaming cup of coffee --

KRUG
Thank you Mrs Collingwood

EMMA
Emma

She hands another mug to Sadie

SADIE
Thank you Emma

Sadie looks around at the kitchen in awe

SADIE (CONT’D)
This is a really beautiful
kitchen Everything’s so white
and squeaky clean

Emma’s a little weirded out by Sadie’s childlike leering

EMMA
(awkwardly)
Oh Thanks
(to Justin)
Justin do you want some hot
chocolate

Justin sits across the room in a chair by the corner
staring ahead blankly with a towel wrapped around him

KRUG
(smiling)
If he doesn’t it’ll be a first
(to Justin)
What do you say Justin

Justin slowly looks up at Krug Keeping his voice
pleasant Krug makes firm “answer me” eyes at him
Justin robotically looks to Emma

JUSTIN
(quietly)
Yes please

Francis flinches a little as John roots through his
medical bag on the table digs out some stitches and
needle starts sewing the gash on his nose

JOHN
Try not to move

Emma stirs some cocoa powder into a bright RED MUG

EMMA
(to Krug)
What were you doing out in the
storm anyway

KRUG
We’re just your typical clueless
city slickers We came out here
for a day at the lake We knew it
might rain but we didn’t know it
would be a damn hurricane

JOHN
Neither did the airhead weather
babe
(off Emma’s glare)
Okay she wasn’t an airhead

Krug chuckles at John’s joke Then

KRUG
Anyway two wrong turns and one
slippery ass road later our car’s
wrapped around a tree

SADIE
That’s putting it mildly

Emma finishes stirring the hot chocolate

EMMA
Yeesh I’m so sorry

She walks to Justin and offers it to him smiling warmly
Justin slowly looks up Emma in silent misery After a
moment he reaches out and takes the mug from her

JUSTIN
(quietly)
Thank you

Unnerved at his gaze Emma nods

EMMA
Sure You’re okay Justin I
can’t imagine what you just went
through but you’re okay Okay

She smiles walks back to the counter as Francis flinches
again

FRANCIS
Owfuck

JOHN
Almost there

Seeing Emma’s concern for Justin Krug quickly gestures
to a “Happy Birthday” banner hanging on the wall in the
dining room

KRUG
So who’s birthday is it Yours
Emma Let me guess

Krug narrows his eyes at Emma mock-thinking He points
at her decisively

KRUG (CONT’D)
Twenty-eight

Emma laughs as John smiles
JOHN
I don’t think flattery will get

you too far

EMMA
How would you know

John snorts half in amusement half in irritation

EMMA (CONT’D)

(to Krug)
Our daughter turns eighteen
tomorrow
KRUG
Oh that’s a fun age She’s
legal dad
JOHN

Don’t remind me
John finishes stitching Francis’ nose

JOHN (CONTD)
Done Just let me clean it off

John sloshes some disinfectant on a small folded cloth

JOHN (CONT’D)
This’ll sting

John touches the cloth to Francis’ nose and he grits his
teeth in pain

KRUG
Mind if I use your land line

JOHN
Sure it’s right there

KRUG)

(heading to phone)
We can’t get through on our crappy
cells --

EMMA
The service is so bad up here

KRUG
(heading to the
phone)
I‘ll see if I can’t just get us a
tow truck or a cab to take us
in to town
SADIE

You sure that’s a good idea Krug

Krug pauses Glares at Sadie pissed at her questioning
him --

SADIE (CONTD)

(covering)
I mean do they even have taxis
here
EMMA

They might have one or two

JOHN
(re storm)
Good luck getting anyone out here

Krug grabs the phone off the wall just as

OUTSIDE - a very close very loud BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS
through the branch of a tree Sparks FLY as the branch
falls into the phone and power lines severing their
connection to the house

BACK IN THE KITCHEN - the lights GO OUT

KRUG
(re dead phone)
I think that luck might be
waning

Krug hangs up the dead phone

EMMA
Don’t worry were prepared

Emma fishes around digs out the matches and candles
starts lighting as John secures a butterfly bandage to
Francis’ nose

JOHN
Looks like we’re prisoners in our
own home

KRUG

Well I can think of worse
places

John slaps Francis on the shoulder
JOHN

(to Francis)
Youre fixed for now my friend

Francis rises

FRANCIS
Thanks I think

Emma hands Francis a mug of coffee and he eyes the
attractive woman with interest

FRANCIS (CONTD)
And thank you

Emma notices Francis’ hungry eyes --

JOHN
(to Emma re Mari)
Em will you see if our cell by
some miracle has maybe just half
a bar

EMMA

Emma gladly steps out Francis watches her all the way

JOHN
I‘ll get a fire going

KRUG
Can we pick the right house to
roll a car in front of or what

CUT TO

EXT LAKE - NIGHT -— SHORT TIME LATER

The storm rages Gusting winds make white caps on the
lake’s surface We slowly PAN ACROSS and TILT DOWN to
find that “NO WAKE” buoy thrashing about

A FLASH of LIGHTNING ignites a FIGURE - floating in the
water a few yards from the buoy The flash was so brief
were not even sure what we saw was real

But then -- another FLASH as --

CU - A WET HAND GRABS on to the BUOY

A DARK FORM bobs in the water next to it LIGHTNING

impose -- they‘ve done more than
enough --

JOHN

I don’t think you have much
choice It’s okay we have a
couple of spare bedrooms --

KRUG
Well that’s mighty kind of you --

EMMA
(a bit too quickly)
Or the guest house Might work
best

JOHN
(meaning Mari)
You think she’1ll be okay with
that

EMMA
Sure she’s not coming back
tonight It’d be more private

KRUG
Whatever you think’s best

recede into the wall and disappear

hand shuts his eyes --

The muted sound of PEOPLE TALKING is heard from the
living room as the bathroom door UNLOCKS and slowly opens
a little for Justin to stick his head out

Seeing that the coast is clear he walks into the hall
and approaches the living room

JUSTIN’S POV - Through the living room doorway Krug
comes into view as he talks to Emma and John

KRUG
You sure we’re not in your way

JOHN
No don’t worry about it It’s no
big deal really Once things
clear up in the morning we’ll get
you outta here one way or another

Concern floods Justin’s face He looks down opens his
hand eyes the necklace in his palm his mind racing

He then ducks into the

Where he looks around frantically then eyes the deep
kitchen sink Keeping an eye on the living room doorway
Justin quickly heads to the sink eyes his red mug
sitting in the bottom

He quickly takes out the necklace and places it
conspicuously AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE MUG

Enter in the darkness

EMMA (CONT’D)
So the bathroom’s in there

pressure though There might be
some stuff in the medicine cabinet
if Justin feels sick again

Krug and Francis cross the room to approach Emma as she
ducks into the bathroom

EMMA (CONTD)
We’re pretty well stocked I
think

Emma turns back for the bedroom and flinches slightly as
she finds Krug and Francis standing right in front of
her a little too close

EMMA (CONT’D)
Anything you need before we turn
in for the night

Krug smiles mechanically

KRUG
No you’ve done more than enough
already We’re perfect thanks

EMMA
Well if you need anything just --

just -- come on back over and give
us a shout

KRUG

from her cunt

Francis hungrily watches Emma disappear into the house

A healthy FIRE blazes in the fireplace creating ghoulish
dancing shadows as they approach the sliding glass door

The BANGING is even louder now as John and Emma appear on
the other side of the glass door

John unlocks the door and slides it open He aims the
flashlight beam around the room

JOHN’S POV - scanning across the porch as rain pounds
down on the screened-in room

The flashlight’s beam comes to the porch’s SCREEN-DOOR as
it BANGS in the wind

John heads to the door latches it shut He then looks
down the beam falling on A TRAIL OF SMALL PUDDLES John
aims the beam along the trail that stops on a pair of wet
SNEAKERS poking out from behind the hot tub

John’s eyes widen in horror He bolts around to the back
of the hot tub where

MARI

comes into view slouched on her side against it her
blood and water-soaked body limp her eyes rolling to the
back of her head

JOHN
MARI JESUS

John stumbles to Mari’s side shaking her as Emma rushes
over --

EMMA
Oh God Mari

JOHN
Mari Mari stay with me

He touches his index finger to her neck feeling for a
pulse

EMMA
Oh god -- oh my god --
Another FLASH of lightning and ROAR of thunder -- John
pulls up Mari’s eyelid --
JOHN
(panicking)

I can’t tell what’s --

John fumbles for the flashlight frantically using it to
examine Mari’s bloody wounds He pulls back her shredded
tank top near her shoulder where the darkest blood stain
is --

JOHN (CONT‘’D)
She’s been shot --

EMMA
Do something John do something

John shakily lifts Mari into his arms --

JOHN
Not you Mari -- not you too --
you hear me

Over this John gently lays Mari on top of the covered
hot-tub He looks down to the tub’s digital temperature
readout frantically punches a button raising the water
temp to the max

John checks Mari’s pulse again then quickly starts CPR
pushing on her chest blowing into her pale mouth

JOHN (CONTD)
Cmon Mari -- one two three —-

He breathes into her mouth again -- then presses his
hands to her chest --

JOHN (CONT’D)
One two --

Mari suddenly COUGHS up water -- John’s eyes widen --

JOHN (CONT’D)
That’s it sweetie —-

He gently rolls her on her side letting the excess water
drain from her mouth --

JOHN (CONT’D)
Mari you’re with mom and dad
you’re gonna be okay -- We‘ve
gotta stop the bleeding -- Emma
go get -- go get blankets
towels

EMMA

JOHN
(talking over her)

John pauses seeing the raging fire through the glass
door in the living room -- an idea

JOHN (CONTD)

-- put the poker in the fire --
We’re gonna have to do it the old
fashioned way --

EMMA
But what about the bullet John

JOHN
Goddammit right now stopping the
bleeding’s more important than
fishing for the fucking bullet --

Emma bolts into the living room JAMS the poker in the
center of the fire --

in the sight of Mari’s necklace -- neatly encircling the

horror at what he’s seeing 0S It’s clear now that John
knows his daughter was raped

He leans down as her eyes open halfway --

MARI

JOHN

Okay -- we can fix that -- that’s

easy for me okay

John reaches in his bag pulls out some medical tape
Anxiously looks around the room spots Emma’s bag full of
magazines and a larger pair of house scissors

He grabs the bag dumps out the magazines He swipes up

a magazine revealing the newspaper Emmawas reading and
Krug’s face on the front page --

John eyes it wide-eyed -- frozen in disbelief -- the
fury boiling -- another beat then he re-focuses on Mari
tearing a small section of the magazine’s cover off --

JOHN (CONTD)
Emma Where the hell are--

John whirls around sees Emma standing there in the
darkness John startles slightly grabs the bottle of
Jack twists it open starts pouring it over the
scissors

JOHN (CONT’D)
(quietly to Emma re
Mari)

Her lung’s collapsed -- can you

hold her down

Emma nods still dazed from her discovery as she leans
down to Mari --

JOHN (CONT’D)
What’s wrong --

Emma brings up the necklace

EMMA
It was in the sink -- The kid --
Justin -- I think he put it there--

John hesitates only for a beat totally overloaded with
that one --

Daniels over the blades then proceeds to slice into

Mari’s upper chest above her heart
Mari winces in pain

JOHN (CONTD)

I know sweetie -- almost there --
just letting out some trapped
air

EMMA
John --

John grabs a towel dabs at the blood then RIPS a piece
of medical tape off affixes it to the section of
magazine cover He then tapes the magazine cover over
the small hole he’s just cut into Mari’s chest

As Mari breathes we see the piece of magazine raise up
and down from the escaping air as Mari’s breathing
becomes less labored

JOHN
How’s that
MARI
Bet -- better --
JOHN
Good Just be still Don’t try

to talk

Mari manages a slight smile now John smiles then eyes
Emma They step away from Mari John speaking in a
hushed whisper

He saw her picture -- on the

her hair

EMMA (CONTD)
Everything’s gonna be okay We’re

Emma kisses Mari on the forehead Turns to see John
standing in the doorway He shakes his head slightly
“no keys”

Emma nods back She knows what that means --

INT GUEST HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

cU - JUSTIN - still lying on the pull-out bed facing the
bedroom doorway He suddenly sees

KRUG

Roll out of bed head into the bathroom Justin looks
over to Francis who’s nodding off in the lazy boy

Beat Then -- Justin slides out of bed tip-toes into
the bedroom doorway --

JUSTIN’S POV - Sadie’s in bed Lightly snoring

Justin sneaks into the bedroom his feet CREAKING over
the floor as he approaches the gun on the bedside table

BACK ON FRANCIS - a lightning flash and roll of thunder
wakes him up He rubs his eyes groggy He glances to
the pull-out bed Sees that Justin isn‘t there His
brow furrows in suspicion but then -- he hears the
toilet FLUSH OS

BACK IN THE BEDROOM - JUSTIN

-- the gun now in hand -- whips his head toward the
bathroom door -- hears the LOCK unlatching Justin’s
eyes widen There’s no way he can make it back to the
living room in time

WITH KRUG - He exits the bathroom back into the bedroom
As he rounds the bed we DROP DOWN to reveal

JUSTIN

Hiding underneath the bed his head right next to Mari‘’s
duffel bag

KRUG

groggily makes his way around to his side of the bed
where his foot suddenly JAMS against something SOLID in
Mari’s duffel bag stubbing his toe

KRUG
Son of a --

SADIE
What

Krug looks down sees the duffel bag protruding from
under the bed

KRUG’S HAND

Reaches down grabs it Justin nearly hyperventilates as
the bag is suddenly swiped away

Krug lifts up the heavy bag unzips it reaches inside
and pulls out one of Mari’s jogging weights Then one
more then a wrist band --

KRUG
What the fuck --

He stuffs everything back in the bag tosses it aside

Falls back to the bed blows out the candle next to the
gun Justin put back on the table Close call

INT COLLINGWOOD HOUSE - GARAGE —- NIGHT

John enters aims the flashlight around Heads to the
workbench where he picks up a large WRENCH

He hefts the simple weapon testing its weight looking
down at it in nervous apprehension

He puts it back on his tool table with a trembling hand
and picks up a big HAMMER testing it
INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

CU - EMMA’S HAND pulls a BUTCHER’S KNIFE from its place
in the knife-holder

She stares down at the enormous weapon a mirror of
John’s nervous apprehension

FRANCIS (0S)
Hey there

Emma YELPS in surprise and spins around to see Francis
standing just ten feet from her

FRANCIS (CONTD)
Sorry sorry I thought you heard
me come in I saw the fire still
going Figured you were both
night owls

Emma smiles weakly

EMMA
Uh just me John’s asleep

Emma breathes hard staring at Francis in frozen terror

FRANCIS
That last lightning bolt woke me
up Thought maybe a cold beer
might help put me back to sleep

Francis turns for the fridge Emma’s eyes widen
Francis is about to see the family photo

EMMA
Wait --

Francis turns back
EMMA (CONT’D)

I don’t think a cold beer’s gonna
cut it Not on a night like this

FRANCIS
Well what is gonna cut it Mrs
Collingwood

EMMA

I think a warmer adult beverage --

FRANCIS
Adult beverage huh We fall into
that category

Francis moves closer eyeing Emma’s cleavage beneath her
button down blouse

EMMA
I think we do

FRANCIS
Then I guess you’re my bartender
Maybe a little Jack Daniels --

EMMA
(an icy glare)
We just ran out of that Youa
wine drinker

Francis smiles

FRANCIS
Guess I am tonight

EMMA
Then you’re in luck

Emma walks to the knife on the counter She eyes it in
trembling uncertainty as she reaches up to the wine
shelf grabs a bottle --

EMMA (CONT’D)
That rain letting up any

FRANCIS
Ah it’s not that bad out there
anymore

Emma turns and freezes in surprise as she sees that
Francis has come closer to stand right in front of her

Emma flinches a little as Francis reaches past her He
leisurely picks up the knife from the counter

FRANCIS (CONTD)
I think the storm’s finally on its
way out

Francis slides the knife back into its empty place in the
knife-holder and smiles at Emma innocently A beat

FRANCIS (CONT’D)
Do I get a glass or do you want me
to chug it straight from the
bottle

EMMA
Glasses Right Sorry

Emma goes to the fridge and smoothly slides the photo off
the door and slips it in her jeans pocket just as Francis
turns and approaches Emma goes up on her tiptoes opens
the cabinet above the fridge pulls out two wine glasses

EMMA (CONTD)
Here we go

Francis eyes her ass hungrily but quickly raises his
eyes to meet hers again as she turns back around

FRANCIS
(smiling)
Thanks
Francis suddenly pauses --

FRANCIS (CONT’D)
Now all we need’s --

Francis suddenly stops short -- seeing something 0S

FRANCIS’S POV - peering through the living room and

sliding glass door to Mari lying on the hot tub on the
back porch
FRANCIS (CONTD)
-- Holy fucking --

He turns back Emma is standing right behind him She
SMASHES the WINE BOTTLE across his face

EMMA
You fucking animals

Francis stumbles back toward the living room looks up
only to come face to face with JOHN - stepping into the
doorway the HAMMER raised SMACK John BASHES Francis’
jaw in

Francis stumbles to the side in stunned shock hitting
the counter SHATTERING some dinnerware --

John SWINGS at him again but misses the hammer SMASHING
through a cabinet next to Francis’ head --

Terrified Francis turns to escape but runs right into
the business end of that shiny BUTCHER KNIFE

Francis freezes in shock Looks down to see the knife
protruding from his chest

He looks up his dying eyes meeting those of

EMMA

Staring at him as he slinks to the floor
EMMA (CONTD)

What did you do to my daughter
Huh Were you the one that shot

her Raped her

Francis’ eyes widen in shock the full knowledge of
what’s happening overtaking him --

Francis CRIES OUT in GURGLING wretchedness choking on
his own blood as

JOHN

Strides over brings up the hammer once again flips it
around so that the claws face out

THUNK He SMASHES the claws down into the top of
Francis’ head bloodily DRIVING them into his skull

Francis instantly goes limp his eyes wide and glassy
his mouth frozen open in a gaping silent scream

A strange quiet fills the room as John and Emma stand
over Francis’ motionless body

They both slowly look out the window to the guesthouse
No visible movement inside as Emma PULLS the knife from
Francis’ motionless body

JOHN
Weve gotta do this quick

CUT TO

INT GUESTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The door slowly opens John cautiously slips inside with
his hammer in hand Emma follows with her knife

Both eye the empty pull-out bed Justin’s not there

John eyes the dark partially-open doorway leading to the
bedroom and looks at Emma Nods to the chest of drawers

Emma tip toes over to the chest slides the drawers open
anxiously looking for the boat keys She turns to John
shakes her head -- they’re not here

John swallows and quietly moves to the door Carefully
reaches out and eases it open --

INT GUESTHOUSE - BEDROOM —- NIGHT —- CONTINUOUS

The door CREAKS John winces as a lightning flash
ignites the dark bedroom

He sees Krug and Sadie sleeping in the bed Krug wears
only pants while Sadie’s in her underwear

John warily glances across the room and freezes his eyes
widening in shock as he sees

JUSTIN

sitting huddled in the far corner of the room AWAKE and
looking just as surprised and terrified as he is

Emma appears over John’s shoulder also FREEZES at the
sight of Justin

The three stare at each other in uncertainty And then --

Justin raises Krug’s gun and AIMS IT AT JOHN AND EMMA

John and Emma instinctively back away -- raise their
hands Take it easy kid -- easy --

cU - JUSTIN - his hand trembling -- tears streaming down
his face -- he snivels -- then -- he suddenly turns the

gun around and extends his arm further toward John and
Emma And they realize --

He wants them to take the gun

John nods to Justin Then carefully steps forward across
the creaking hardwood floor that’s only partially muted
by the thunder and downpour

John keeps walking warily keeping his eyes on Justin

CREAK He steps on another loose FLOORBOARD John
freezes as Krug GROANS and shifts in bed

Emma tenses from the doorway
Krug stays asleep

Relieved John keeps going closing in on the gun as
Justin quietly stays in his place

John reaches out -- and gently takes it out of Justin’s
outstretched hand

A beat of eyes on terrified eyes Justin then looks away
as John turns to the bed and raises the gun aiming it
point blank at Sadie just as a BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes
just outside

The CRASH of thunder wakes Sadie and Krug up Sadie
bolts upright in bed sees John’s silhouette standing
over her

SADIE
No

Sadie rolls away as John SHOOTS BAM The bullet
strikes her in the side of her neck

Sadie SCREAMS in agony as Krug dives out of the bed
grabs one of Mari’s jogging weights he found in her
duffel and hurls it back at John SMACKING him in the
shoulder just as he FIRES

Emma charges for Krug who grabs another weight and throws
it at her forcing her to dive back into the living room

John whirls back only to be tackled by a SCREAMING and
FLAILING Sadie

SADIE (CONT’D)
You fucking cocksucker what the
fuck are you doing

She’s beating her arms on John who drops the gun forced
to fight her off

JOHN
Get the fuck off me --

John gains the upper hand grabs Sadie and tosses her
aside sending her sliding into the bathroom

With that John grabs the gun raises up and FIRES at
Krug who has grabbed and is now HEAVING the mattress up
and over toward John

John dives and rolls from underneath it takes aim and
FIRES at Krug just missing him as

KRUG

DIVES through the window in a hail of shattered glass
John stumbles out awkwardly from under the mattress gets
to his feet and charges to the window Looks out to see
Krug running away through the downpour heading for the

empty hall and doorways of the upper floor

John hardens himself and presses forward slowly
approaching the guest bedroom door

WITH KRUG - He hears the creaks raises the poker But

sees the STREAK OF A FLASHLIGHT BEAM dancing around down
by the lake A lightning flash illuminates the distant

Krug slides the window up as lightning FLASHES and
THUNDER ROLLS --—

floor staggers to the landing’s railing grabs it tries
to pull himself up

Krug raises his foot and KICKS John hard sending him
through the railing At the last second John grabs one
of the railing’s supports as it pops free of the
foundation

John dangles over the floor Krug SMACKS his hand with
the poker John lets go and plummets to the floor But
it’s not nearly as long a fall as it would have been

IN THE FOYER

John hits the floor with a tremendous THUD as pieces of
railing fall around him

John moans and stirs starting to come around as
KRUG
Stalks down the stairs flips the poker around --

KRUG (CONT’D)
Your little girl and her friend

John reacts to the mention of Mari’s “friend” as Krug
strokes the tip of the poker --

KRUG (CONT’D)
You wanna know what I did to Mari
I think you do I think you wanna
know what it felt like --

Krug leans down over a still groggy John and readies the
poker gripping it as if he’s about to shove it up
between John’s legs

Krug starts the horrific motion to do just that when --
the familiar SOUND of a COCKING GUN O0S STOPS HIM COLD

He slowly turns comes face to face with --

JUSTIN - standing RIGHT BEHIND HIM aiming the silenced
gun POINT BLANK his moist eyes wide and terrified

KRUG (CONT’D)
What the fuck are you doing

JUSTIN
Stopping you Forever

Krug quickly softens taking a step forward

KRUG
Take it easy Justin Don’t do

Justin pulls the trigger --
CLICK The gun’s empty

Krug flinches in surprise staring at the barrel pointed
at him as he realizes his son just tried to shoot him

Equally surprised Justin stares at the useless weapon
Krug swings the poker KNOCKS Justin to the floor

KRUG (CONT’D)
You sure picked a funny moment to
grow some balls

Justin tries to crawl away but Krug quickly yanks him up
off the floor gets in his face

KRUG (CONTD)
But it’s too late Because I --

Krug holds Justin in place as he pushes the poker hard
into Justin’s abdomen -- Justin looks at Krug eyes wide
in fear as Krug presses harder the poker breaking the
skin now blood seeping through Justin’s sweatshirt --

JUSTIN
(gasping)
Better -- look --

EXTINGUISHER She SPRAYS an explosive barrage of
pressurized foam into Krug’s face --

Krug CRIES OUT drops the poker stumbles back with his
hands to his blinded eyes as John get to his feet
angrily GRABS the fire extinguisher from Emma and
advances toward Krug
