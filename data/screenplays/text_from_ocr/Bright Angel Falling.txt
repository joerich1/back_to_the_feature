xMINUS SIX MONTHS TONIGHT

A BRILLIANT NIGHT SKY FILLS THE FRAME The air is so clear
we can see the gossamer fringes of the Milky Way Suddenly
the sky jolts “and the camera pans violently left coming
to a shaky stop It goes out of focus and then becomes
sharp again Everything looks normal except for the
faintest smear of light in the center It looks just a bit
elongated and it’s not easy to see

MANS VOICE
That’s a comet

YOUNG GIRLS VOICE
That’s a comet

MAN’S VOICE
Youre sure

YOUNG GIRL’S VOICE
I’m positive

We now see that we are in the backyard of a pleasant home in the
suburbs of Tucson Arizona It is part of a development that
winds its way through newly paved streets that are all named Via
Del something

LORETTA SAITO a 15-year-old Japanese--American stands next to
her father BOB SAITO who is squinting through an impressive
looking amateur telescope not the kind of instrument you
normally find in the backyard Loretta has glasses and looks
like the kid people want to sit next to when there is a math
test however she is a remarkably un-selfconscious girl
especially for an adolescent

BOB SAITO
How come it doesn‘t have a tail I
thought comets have tails

LORETTA
It will have a tail once it gets near
the sun Then the carbon dioxide and
hydrocarbons sublimate from the surface
and blow in the solar wind Ive told you
this before

BOB SAITO
How could I have forgotten I’m the tax
lawyer youre the genius kid and what
is sublimate ‘

LORETTA
Its when something vaporizes and then

There is a scream from inside the house and then SHARON SAITO- -
Loretta’s mother--comes racing into the backyard carrying a
portable telephone She is holding it like it is made of
something radioactive

SHARON SAITO
Its them It’s them The C-B-T
T-B-C the what-do-you-call-itit’s
them

LORETTA
Oh my God CBAT Its really them

SHARON SAITO
Thats what I said

LORETTA
Oh my God

Loretta stares at the phone

Loretta is

Loretta stares up at the sky
Sidecompletely forgetting that it is there

BOB SAITO
Do you think maybe you should talk to
them

jolted back to earth and picks up the phone

LORETTA
Helhello

SPOTA (V O)
HelloMs Saito

LORETTA
Yes

SPOTA (V0)

This is George Spota of the Central Bureau
for Astronomical Telegrams in Cambridge
We are very pleased to inform you that
your sighting has been confirmed as a new
comet Benton Wolfeone of our more
esteemed astronomers called it in last
nightalthough he was an hour fifty
minutes after you So we have decided to
officially name the new comet Saito-Wolfe

begins to trembleand her eyes brim with tears

Loretta can’t stop looking at the sky She is crying and smiling

SPOTA (VO )
Hello Ms Saito

at the same time

LORETTA
(whispering)
Saito-Wolfe my own comet

SPOTA (VO )
Hello Are you there

She lowers the telephone to her
Her lower lip
3

Her father gently takes the telephone from his daughter‘s hand
He is clearly touched by what he sees We push in on Loretta’‘s
face as we hear her father’s voice behind her

BOB SAITO
Hello this is Bob Saito Loretta’s
father Yes
(pause)
Oh yes were very proud of her

EXT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - RUNWAY - FLORIDA - DAY

Two deep-throated sonic booms shake Orlando as the Space Shuttle
Atlantis plummets toward the ground The orbiter shimmers in the
heat of the afternoons setting sun and the optics of a
1000-milimeter lens

The orbiter’s tires hit the runway with puffs of smokethe
drogue chute is deployed and the massive Atlantis slows to a
stop right on the mark The telltale charring of some of the
ceramic tiles is mind-boggling evidence that this is an aircraft
that has arrived from space this is not the United flight from
New York Vehicles rush to meet it The door opens as the
ground crew swarms toward it and the MISSION COMMANDER steps
out He squintsas he surveys the ochre-lit runway in the
setting sun

His name is WILL SEACORD He is a man in his early 40s He has
the athletic Marlboro Man good looks that one would associate
with an astronaut However there is something else

something besides the advanced degrees in aeronautical
engineering and applied physics something beneath the
sun-weathered skin the strong jaw It is his eyes They are
softer and more whimsical than they should be They have seen
things that few mortals have seen They have seen the moon and
the heavens with a clarity that only searchers who have ventured
beyond our atmosphere have seen They have looked down at the
earth from a vantage point known only by the rarest of

travelers and by God

Right behind him is his friend and the mission co-pilot BRENT
KUNETKA who flashes the victory sign to the cameras

WILL tries a self-conscious smile knowing that his is being
photographed

KUNETKA
(to Will)
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the
planet Earth where the local time is six
forty-eight On behalf of Captain Seacord
and the entire flight crew thank you for
flying Atlantis
EXT TERMINAL BUILDING - KSC - SUNSET

The crew bus pulls up to a noticeably small crowd This is
different than the Halcyon days of the Space program It is
mostly family and friends of the crewsome with miniature
American flags skeleton crews from the media and a few die-hard
NASA fans Will is the first out of the bus Kunetka follows
and then the remaining four astronauts three men and one woman
(SHIRLEY PICKET) Will scans the crowd The rest of the crew
pass him and rush to the arms of waiting wives (in Picket’s case
a husband) and children Will does not see whoever he was
looking for He is alone in this sea of familial bliss

There is a momentary flicker of sadness on his face and then the
practiced smile of someone who is used to being on camera

Kunetka is embracing his wife and looks over at Will He sees
what is going on

SUBURBAN HOUSTON - DAY

The Texas humidity hangs over the day like a moist curtain
CORDELIA (COREY) SEACORD is tired as she gets out of her car
She is wearing a nurses uniform She is an angular and extremely
attractive woman with black hair and wide cheekbones courtesy
of her Lakota Sioux mother

She closes the car door and starts toward the house and then
stops She hears something and frowns

EXT BACKYARD - DAY

Will is working at the sprinkler control box near the side of the
house Corey stands there for a second watching him

COREY
What are you doing

Will looks up with a start

WILL
Oh Hi uh I noticed the lawn is
turning brown The sprinkler system
it hadn’t been turned on to the summer
cycle

He closes the sprinkler box and stands up wiping his sweaty
hands on his jeans

COREY
Well that’s nice of you except you
can’t just come here anymore without
calling first You know that

WILL
Yeah I know I know Its just the
lawn I was

COREY

Its not your lawn anymore

Will looks down at the ground He looks a lot more attractive
than she wants him to

WILL
It was turning brown
COREY
I’‘ll paint it
WILL

Why didn’t you bring Claire to the landing
like I asked you to

COREY
She couldn’t get away she had a school--

WILL
Bullshit

He is visibly angry He glares at her She does not know what
to say

WILL
You didn’t have to keep her from me

The expression on Coreys face is one of deep sadness She is
not trying to be combative She shakes her head

COREY
WillI don’t want to hurt you
WILL
So you do it by accident
COREY
Will
WILL
Shes my daughter she should have been
there
COREY
Will
WILL

and you know it

COREY
She didn’t want to go

Will stares at her

WILL
What

COREY
I tried to get her to go She refused

He looks like he has been slapped in the face
2

WILL
Thats nuts no

COREY
I‘m sorry

Will walks out of the yard and out to the street Corey stays
rooted to her spot and folds her arms Her eyes brim with
tears The sprinklers go on

EXT CLIFTWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - SUBURBAN HOUSTON - DAY

AURORA CLAIRE SEACORD is on her way home walking with a friend
of hers named VICKI Claire is a 15-year-old in the middle of an
adolescent riot a green streak in her hair a braid full of
beads ears riveted with studs and two silver eyebrow rings
None of this hides the fact that she has her father’s eyes

She suddenly stops and frowns She sees her father standing in
front of his car A parent is probably the last thing she wants
to see when she is with a friend
Will smiles at her She groans

VICKI
Hey is that the astronaut

CLAIRE
Worseit’s my father

VICKI
That is definitely way beyond cool

Claire chews on her lip
EXT GRANDSTANDS - DAY

Will and Claire sit in the rickety high school grandstands They
are alone A few members of the high school track team are
practicing on the field Claire is picking at the pealing green
paint of the wooden stands

WILL
(pointing to her eyebrow)
Does it hurt when they do that

She shrugs

WILL
It’s at this time when I start saying
something like how about that weather

weve been having
She doesn’t even shrug

WILL
Whats going on

CLAIRE
With what

WILL
With you and me You missed the
launch you missed the landing

CLAIRE
YesI missed the chance to go there and
wonder if I was going to be like one of
those Challenger families staring up at a
big ball of smoke where my father used to
be Yes I missed that

WILL
I never knew you felt that way You
should have told me

CLAIRE
Mom said it and you didn’t listen to her
Why should you listen to me

WILL
Youve always been my good luck charm
The first time without my girl I was
scared to death
CLAIRE
Youre the American hero youre never

scared of anything

Will stares at her in disbelief

WILL
I’m scared of what’s happening right now

CLAIRE
It’s a little late for that

WILL
Why are you pushing me away

CLAIRE
Youre the one who left not me

WILL
I didn’t leave you And by the way it
was your mother who wanted the divorce

CLAIRE
You could have fixed things She just
wanted you to come home at night like
everybody else thats all

WILL
Its not that simple

Will looks

CLAIRE
You could have taken that instructor job
like you said you were going to instead
ef going back on the flight roster Then
she would have had a husband and I would
have had a father

WILL
You have a father

CLAIRE
No I don’t I have a story on the eleven
oclock news about you and a bunch of
other people doing weightless somersaults
while youre in orbit Now there’s a real
thrill You know why I quit the swim
team Do you

WILL
Of course I do You pulled a hamstr--

CLAIRE
I quit because I was the only kid who
never had their father at one meet Not
one lousy meet Everybody else’s father
was there making fools of
themselves cheering their heads off
Not my father No he was either
training to be 200 miles up in space or
he actually was 200 miles up in space
Two hundred miles that’s like from
here to San Antonio whoa That’s
certainly worth abandoning your family
for It’s like a drug to you Maybe you
should be in a program or something

WILL
I wish I could explain
CLAIRE
Whats the name of my science teacher
WILL
What
CLAIRE

Go on tell me the name of my science
teacher You can’t can you

WILL
Uh

grief-stricken

CLAIRE
You know what the saddest thing is

WILL
wnat
3

CLAIRE
After you left things didn’t change at
all You cant miss somebody who was
never there

Will looks down at the little pile of chipped paint by Claires
foot

TELEVISION SCREEN

A jerky hand-held image of a home videotape The younger Will is
playing a toy xylophone with 3-year-old Claire He has a song
book which shows the notes by color and Will is plunking the
colored keys accompanying his daughter who is singing

3-YEAR-OLD CLAIRE
Twinkle twinkle little star how I
wonder what you are up above the world
so high like a diamond in the sky

We see that we are in Will’s barely furnished apartment He is
Staring at the videotape His face is lit by the flickering
image on the screen

METEOR CRATER ARIZONA - DAY

It is a spectacular sight a wound in the earth’s crust almost a
mile across and over 600 feet deep The camera moves steadily
toward a dot on the crater’s rim

TARNAUER (VO)
Fifty thousand years ago an asteroid 150
feet across slammed-into the ground here
exploding with the force of many hydrogen
bombs

As the camera gets closer we see that the dot is CHARLIE
TARNAUER a thin angular man in his 70s walking along the
edge and talking He is in fact talking to a television
camera mounted on a helicopter The helicopter roars by him

TARNAUER
This sort of thing is always happening
and in fact the earth had been a cosmic
dart board throughout its history Just
look at the moon and you’ll get an idea
of what we look like underneath all of our
water and vegetation

Tarnauer absent-mindedly kicks a stone into the huge crater
CRATER FLOOR - DAY

We are looking at a MACRO SHOT of an ant colony bustling about
Thousands of them swarm about at the entrance to their colony

“The stone thrown by Tarnauer falls out of the sky and slams
into the ant colony obliterating it

TELEVISION SCREEN - CNN SCIENCE SPECIAL
Tarnauer is talking to the camera the crater behind him

TARNAUVER
In less than six months’ time Comet
Saito-Wolfe will pass within a million
miles of us For astronomers who deal in
light years we shave closer than that

For the rest of this presentation Tarnauer’s narrative will be
illustrated with graphics computer animation and stock
footage It is a very slick and well-edited affair

TARNAUER
When it passes by Earth we will see a
glorious streak that will light up the
night sky several times brighter than the
full moon

The camera begins to pull back from the television screen

TARNAUER
Even though it’s not going to happen what
would occur if Saito-Wolfe would actually
hit us Let me show you something A
comet is made of ice very old very
dirty ice

Tarnauer is standing next to a large globe He takes a tiny

piece of ice and throws it at the globe It hits and bounces
off

TARNAUER
Now watch what happens if the same piece
of ice is traveling much faster

The small piece of ice is now the head of a bullet He puts the
bullet in gun and fires the gun at the globe The globe
shatters

TARNAUER
Saito-Wolfe is a relatively big comet
probably about six kilometers Also it’s
traveling almost forty times the speed of
the fastest bullet Imagine if every
nuclear weapon possessed by every nation
on Earth were to be exploded at the same
time The impact of this comet would be
One thousand--that’s right-- one
thousand times greater than that

We see that the television set we have been watching is in the
middle of an apartment The apartment belongs to BRAN DOCHARD
and MARTY BRAVERMAN--two graduate students at Berkeley

TARNAUER
Not only is this possible It has already
happened Sixty-five million years ago
dinosaurs were the ulers of the planet
(MOR iy

TARNAUER (cont‘d)
In one blinding flash a comet hit It
ripped away half the atmosphere ignited
forests over an entire continent and
turned the sky black as pitch for months
That is why there are no more dinosaurs

Dochard and Braverman are lounging in a sea of clutter Dochard
is intense with the metabolism of a humming bird Braverman is
fat bearded and slow moving They are the Ren and Stimpy of
the Astrophysics Department

TARNAUER
So when Saito-Wolfe fills the sky remind
yourself that this is what the dinosaurs
saw on their last night Saito-Wolfe will
be a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle one of
the miracles of creation However had
its orbit been just a half a degree
different it could just as easily have
been a bright angel of destructionand
we could just as easily have been the next
dinosaurs

The Theme Music and Credits Begin as the program ends Bran
takes a hit off the joint and looks at Marty

BRAN
Hey are you thinking what I’m thinking

Marty rolls his considerable bulk onto his stomach He talks
into the couch

MARTY
Why not

He holds his hand out--without looking--and Bran slaps his own to
it in a semi-conscious high-five

MARTY and BRAN
Theeessissss

Bran sits back His eyes are not well focused

BRAN
We‘ll start in the morning

MARTY
Late in the morning

SPACE SHUTTLE

It is a model of the COLUMBIA and it points toward the ceiling
of LEW BONDY the Flight Directors desk at the JOHNSON SPACE
CENTER in Houston Will is sitting on the other side of the
gleaming desk absent-mindedly running his finger over the
outline of the model Orbiter

BONDY

You did well real well
WILL

Thank you
BONDY

Not that it’s a surprise

WILL
How bad is it

BONDY
How bad is what

WILL
Whatever you’re going to tell me We’ve
known each other a long time and all of a
sudden you’re sitting there so
tight-assed you look like somebody is
taking your temperature

Bondy sits back his chair squeakingand exhales

BONDY
It’s not the greatest

WILL
Im sitting down coach

BONDY
The flight roster for the next eighteen
months is being posted including the

missions with the Russians I wanted you
to hear it from me and not see it ona
wall

(pause)

Stuart Cole is flying Atlantis in six
months Youre the backup

Will nods

WILL
What about after that

Bondy doesn’t answer

WILL
Mmmm well I guess Im going to be
backup for Stuart If he breaks his
ankle Ill fly the mission you

BONDY
Cut the shit Stuart Cole hasn’t had a
hiccup since puberty and you know it

WILL
Then if he breaks his ankle Id better
have an alibi

‘

Will looks

Will tries

BONDY

It sucks I’m sorry Its numbers The
whole goddamn thing is numbers The
number of scheduled manned flights has
been cut in half half Weve been to
the moon now that was sexy we beat the
Russians that was even sexier Now the
Russians have dropped out Theres no
team to beat The Super Bowl doesn’t work
if only one side shows up The ratings
won’t be any good Bad numbers

(pause)
For Christ sake Will you shouldn‘t be
backup to anybody Take the
pilot-instructor job Come on you’ve
done it and done it as well as anybody
could ever do it Its time

at Bondy for a long time

WILL
I have to go again

BONDY
You’re not going you’re the backup

WILL
Then at least I’1l have tried

BONDY
What’s the point

WILL
You haven’t been up there

‘ BONDY
What are you trying to prove

WILL
You havent been up there

BONDY
Was it worth losing your marriage

to answer He can only shake his head

WILL
It’s what I am

BONDY
Take the damn job

WILL
One more try

BONDY
The last flight was the perfect way to end
at

3

WILL
No It can’t be the last flight
BONDY
Why Why
WILL
Because I didn’t know it was the last
flight

Bondy looks at the model and then at Will

INT JSC CAFETERIA - DAY

It is large and harshly lighted -not unlike most institutional
cafeterias except for the IQ of its clientele Will and Kunetka
are pushing their plastic trays along the aluminum rails

KUNETKA
I heard man This is not good at all

They pick up plates of what looks like chicken and vegetables
and keep moving

KUNETKA
Backup shitthat’s a lot of training
to not fly

WILL

Im so glad you pointed that out

Kunetka passes a display of fruit He tosses a banana over his
shoulder without looking

KUNETKA
You know what the problem is

Will catches it without breaking stride and starts to put it on
his tray

KUNETKA
After a certain age your reflexes go

Kunetka fires a hidden orange at Will’s head just as he was

trying to put the banana on his tray Will catches it without
blinking

WILL
Thats true Hello Lize

They arrive at the cashier an elderly woman named LIZE She is
genuinely happy to see the two men

LIZE
Well its nice to see you boys back safe
and sound That‘’s 12 41
(to Kunetka)

and you pay for both because you have
the bigger mouth
1s

KUNETKA
I‘ll pay if you identify what it is

LIZE

Keep talking and it’1ll cost you a dollar
more

KUNETKA
Ill settle for you naming just the
category

LIZE

That‘s two dollars more Keep goingwe
could use a new shuttle

OTHER PART OF CAFETERIA - DAY

Will and Kunetka sit down at a table already occupied by SHIRLEY
PICKET and JUDE FOSTERwho will serve as the CAP COM (Capsule
Communicator) on the next flightand STUART COLE There is
almost an awkward silence It doesn’t have enough time to
blossom before Will turns to Cole

WILL
Let’s cut to it If I have to be a backup
there is no one I would rather back up
than you so let’s have lunch

COLE
Thanks

You can plainly see the mutual respect of the two men The
relief is palpable Everybody goes back to their food

IMINUS THREE MONTHS

EXT MAUNA KEA OBSERVATORY - NIGHT

The giant telescope is taking its first unblinking look at the
stars after the sunlight has stopped intruding

INT MAUNA KEA OBSERVATORY - NIGHT

The faces of TWO YOUNG ASTRONOMERS are glowing in the light of
monitors in the observatory control room They are watching the
image from the telescope as it is digitized and scanned in the
monitor One of them cranes forward a bit staring at the
monitor He studies the image and blinks His name is
SHEPPARD

SHEPPARD
Holy shit

BLACK
The screen is black We hear a telephone ring once twice

the rustling of sheets and then the fumbling for the telephone
receiver

TARNAUER (V O
(barely a whisper)
Hello
(pause)
What

Tarnauer switches on his bedside lamp He is sitting bolt
upright now rubbing his eyes trying to think

TARNAUER
(into phone)
Okay Okay Get everything you can

Call all the other observatories I‘1ll be
there in twenty minutes

He hangs up the phone keeping his hand on it as if there is
something more he should be doing A hand reaches out and
touches his shoulder ERNESTINE BRANDENBURG--his middle-aged
assistant and his wife--sits up bringing her face into the
light

BRANDENBURG
Charlie what the hell is going on
TARNAUER
It’s Saito-Wolfe It just passed the
sun and Mauna Kea is saying the orbit
has the orbit has changed
BRANDENBURG
Changed how
TARNAUBR

They say it’s going to hit us
EXT MISSION SIMULATOR BLDG - JSC - HOUSTON - DAY

Will Kunetka and Picket walk out of the building carrying
their mission books They are slapped in their respective faces
by the heat of the Texas afternoon Will stops He sees
something past camera So does Kunetka

KUNETKA
Well well well

Lew Bondy is escorting two people One of them is VLADIMIR
TIVERZIN a strong athletic looking man The other an
athletic formidable fierce and truly wonderful looking woman

BONDY
Everyone I would like you to meet our two
cosmonaut friends who have just arrived
from Moscow They will begin their
training with us tomorrow Those of you
who have flown joint missions with the
Russians may be familiar with them This
is Major Vladimir Tiverzin and Senior
Captain

The woman has eyes that can bore a hole in sheet metal She
takes your breath away She walks directly to Willtakes his
hands and kisses him on both cheeks

VIERA
Good to see you Colonel

Will tries valiantly to contain his surprise and to not act
flustered It isnt easy Kunetka is amused

WILL
VieraCaptain Dudorov I wasn’t
expecting to see you

VIERA
Leonid has been having heart arythmias
and I’ve been put in his place
She glides to Kunetka and kisses him on both cheeks

VIERA
Hello Brent

KUNETKA
Viera this is Shir--

VIERA

Shirley Picket I am honored to meet you
PICKET

Captain it’s my honor

The beeping sound of a pager goes off Bondy looks at the small
plastic and hurries inside the building

VIERA
My name is now Chernayev
to Will)

Marriage can happen to anyoneeven me

WILL
I hope you are very happy

VIERA
Why would I not be happy

PICKET
I’m excited about working together

VIERA
Our missions do not coincide However we
will be together in training I hope that
does not disturb you Colonel

Why would I be disturbed

There is almost the briefest flash of a smile on her face Bondy
hurries out of the building

BONDY
Something has happened All launches have
been canceled The entire program is on
hold There was no explanation Whatever
the hell it is it’s big

EXT THE WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

The American flag is billowing in a stiff breeze on top of the
sun-soaked White House

INT SITUATION ROOM - MORNING

The President of the United States is flanked by his Secretary of
Defense National Security Advisor Vice President and senior
staffas well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff the Director of
NASA and the Director of the NS C Charlie Tarnauer is also at
the large conference table

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
Are you actually standing there in front
of God and everybody and telling me that
this is the end of the world

TARNAUER
End of the world No sir Mr President
nothing like that No
(he takes a sip of water)
Just the end of civilization

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
Why are we only getting three months
warning on this

TARNAUER
Because the comet just passed closest to
the sun and there was intense solar flare
activity This caused unusually powerful
outgassing from the comet nucleus

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
(interrupting)
Stop Speak English

TARNAUER
Well a comets made of ice The heat
from the sun caused gas to shoot out from
the nucleus This acted like a rocket
motor and changed the orbit by a small
percentage However it only took a small
percentage to change it from a near miss
to a hit

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
I would like you to get specific about
whats going to happen rea specific

TARNAUER
Well the thermal disturbance I
described coupled with tidal forces
created by the comet’s proximity to the
sun

The President glares at him

TARNAUER
Uh the same thing that made the comet
change course also caused the comet‘s
nucleus to break up to fragment It now
consists of a swarm of fragments around
the nucleus A number of fragments are
going to hit

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
How many

TARNAUER
Six fragments over a 72-hour period and
then the nucleus Weve designated them
fragments A through G with G being
the the uh main body

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
How much damage will the fragments do

GENERAL BLOCK
Depending on where they hit it could be
pretty devastating An impact on a city
could be like a nuclear warhead An
impact in the ocean -could cause a tsunami
bigger than anything we’ve ever seen

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
And how much damage will the big one do

TARNAUER
It would make all-out global thermo
nuclear war look like an argument
(pause)
The people who do not survive the initial
blast will be the lucky ones

There is silence in the room

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
Jesus Chicken Little was right The sky
is falling
(pause)
Why don‘t we just try to blow it up

GENERAL BLOCK
We don‘t have enough deliverable nuclear
power to blow up something that size

The President drums his fingers on the shiny oak table

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Even if we had the nuclear power we
couldn’t get it that far into space Our
shuttle program is only for low earth
orbit

TARNAUER
Also blowing it up into small pieces
wouldnt really do that much good It
would only result in thousands of smaller
fragments It would be like taking a
bullet and turning it into a shotgun
blast

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
Let me see if I’ve got this straight
Weve got good news and weve got bad
news The bad news is that we’re all
scheduled to die in twelve weeks The
good news is that it’s only the end of
civilizationnot the end of the world
Is that about it

TARNAUER
Thats about it

PRESIDENT BARRINGER

Well I’ve got good news and bad news fo-
everybody at this table The bad news is
Armageddon is due twelve weeks from now
The good news is right now is not
twelve weeks from now and I wasn’t
elected to this office to sit around with
my thumb up my ass and hope for the best
So here is what were going to do I am
putting Dr Tarnauer in charge of a
Special Science Advisory Committee to
come up with a plan Its going to be a
plan that actually works

(to Tarnauer)
You will have total access to any
resources you need you have the
highest security clearance and you now
have an unlimited budget Also you have
six days to come up with an answer

(to the rest of the group)
Secretary Burr you and the Joint Chiefs
will create a military task force and
come up with any plan the military can
figure out You have the same six days
We will all meet again on that date

(pause)
I realize ordinarily people in government
can’t agree on dinner in six days
Fowever God made the world in six days

(MORE)

PRESIDENT BARRINGER (contd)
That should be enough time for us to
figure out how to save it Thank you
everybody I dont think we should waste
any more time

The President gets up Everyone else rises all a bit stunned
The President gets to the door and stops

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
One more thing--and 1 cant stress this
too highly Security has to be absolutely
ironclad Nobody--and I mean nobody--can
find out about this before we have some
kind of handle on it

He turns and leaves
CLOSEUP TELEVISION SCREEN

The network newscaster’s neatly trimmed face is in front of a
photograph of Saito-Wolfe

NEWSCASTER

is expected to hit within twelve weeks
The White House has refused to confirm or
deny any of this however the scientific
community has been flooding the internet
with calculations and predictions There
are seven fragments that are on a direct
collision course with the earth

EXT WHITE HOUSE - DAY

A huge crowd has gathered across the street They are carrying
signs that are demanding answers from the President

EXT 42ND STREET - NIGHT

Crowds are gathered around an electronic store with its dozens
of television sets showing Charlie Tarnauer standing at the rim
of Meteor Crater during his CNN special

TARNAUER
However it could just as easily have

EXT CALTECH - DAY

Tarnauer exits a government limousine with some of his advisors
and Brandenburg He enters the Department of Planetary Science
building He is surrounded by a phalanx of Secret Service
Agents and is followed by a horde of hysterial Reporters
shouting unanswered questions to him

INT CORRIDOR - CALTECH - DAY

It is bedlam as the procession passes Two scruffy looking young
men break through the crowd--one rather heavy the other lean

BRAN
Dr Tarnauer Dr Tarnauer I’m Bran
Dochard weve spoken on the phone

The two Secret Service agents start to react at the approaching
men Tarnauer stops them

TARNAUER
Do I know you

BRAN
I’m Bran Dochard

TARNAUER
Youve already said that

BRAN
This is Marty Braverman Were graduate
students from Berkeley We’‘ve spoken--

TARNAUER
I‘m pretty busy right now

He starts to walk away Bran stuffs a heavy manila envelope
under Tarnauer’s arm

BRAN
Please Dr Tarnauer you must read this
right away

As more reporters catch up to Tarnauer the din grows louder He
nods absent-mindedly to Bran and walks away

BRAN
Pleaseyou must read it

Tarnauer and the accompanying whirlwind are gone Bran and
Marty are left standing in the corridor

BRAN
Now that’s a major-league prick I’m
telling you man never meet your heroes

MARTY
Let’s go home man

ANOTHER CORRIDOR

Tarnauer and’his entourage burst around the corner of a long
corridor He takes the manila envelope and drops it in a trash
can without missing a stride Brandenburg walking behind him
picks the envelope up from the trash can and stuffs it in her
shoulder bag She has to hurry to catch up to Tarnauer

COMMAND CENTER - PENTAGON - DAY

A large conference hall has been taken over A small army of
people hustle around with boxes files and every imaginable
piece of computer equipment Tarnauer is moving like a
whirlwind As usual Brandenburg is with him Two other people
are with him now CUMMINS and WEAVER

CUMMINS
Preliminary analysis is bleak DOD hasn‘t
come up with anything

WEAVER
The shuttle can’t get up there Nothing

TARNAUER
You two are telling me all the things we
can‘t do I want to know what the hell
we can do Tell me something I don’t
“ know

CUMMINS

Gick

INT HOTEL SUITE - LATE NIGHT

The camera starts on the carpeted floor Time Magazine is lying
there its cover boldly pronouncing “Countdown to Cataclysm
with an artists rendering of a comet striking the earth with an
explosion destroying the planet The camera moves through the
large suite Every piece of furniture is piled high with
documents printouts books files and disks The television is
on although the sound is off We can see the continuous
coverage of Saito-Wolfe Tarnauer is slumped over on his desk
face down in a sheaf of printouts He is snoring The camera
moves into the bedroom Brandenburg is sitting up in bed
reading the document Bran Dochard gave her She is on the last
page She closes it and chews on her glasses Brandenburg gets
out of bed and walks to the living room She sees Tarnauerand
gently shakes his shoulder

BRANDENBURG
You better read this

Tarnauer rubs his eyes

TARNAUER

Not tonight
BRANDENBURG

Tonight Right now Trust me on this
INT ASTROPHYSICS DEPARTMENT - BERKELEY - DAY

Bran and Marty have their four feet up on the cluttered desk they
share in a small cubicle They look tired and more than a
little depressed There is a low rumble outside the window It
grows in intensity accompanied by a rhythmical thumping It
gets louder and louder The window shakes Bran and Marty pick
up the Venetian blinds and look out as the massive silhouette
of a Bell 222 twin engine helicopter descends right by their

window and lands in the middle of the campus quadrangle
scattering students and kicking up a small storm of leaves
and papers

INT THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

The doors to the Situation Room open revealing Tarnauer and a
wide-eyed Bran and Marty They can’t believe what they are
seeing

The JCS chairman with all of the Joint Chiefs make you squint
their uniforms ribbons and stars are so bright The Secretary
of Defense is seated next to the National Security Advisor who
is seated next to the vice President And finally seated at the
end of the table is the President of the United States

MARTY
Uh you do all the talking

Bran and Marty are led into the room by Tarnauer Marty is
coming close to hyperventilation

BRAN
(whispering)
Youve got mustard on your tie

Marty looks down horrified He realizes there is nothing there
He stifles a smile

MARTY
(whispering)
Asshole

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
Youre not the first person to call me
that and you won‘t be the last

Marty looks like he has been electrocuted

MARTY
What -No oh I uh Mr Presid--

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
Please sit down I am very happy to meet
you both

They sit along with Tarnauer

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
So tell me is it really true that the
plan to save the world actually wound up
in a trash can

Tarnauer’s shoulders noticeably sag

BRAN
Marty and me got the idea to write our
thesis on a comet strike after we saw Dr
Tarnauer’s special on television

MARTY
(whispering)
Marty and 1

BRAN

We figured it would be cool to simulate
what we’d do if a no-kidding comet
impactor came along without a lot of
warning The idea was what could you do
with existing space assets if you only had
a few months to pull it off

(shrugs)
Who knew

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
Obviously nobody in the government

TARNAUER
The Dochard-Braverman proposal involves
thermonuclear weapons in a deployment that
is truly unique

BRAN
Since we can’t just try to blow it up we
have to deflect it--move it off its
orbital path just enough so that it
misses the earth

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
How do you propose to do that

BRAN
We need two bombs--really big ones--50
megatons each should do it The trick is
to place them carefully You’re like a
diamond cutter you gotta hit with the
right force and at just the right angle
You got anything for me to write on

Before Bran can blink one AIDE scurries to the far wall He
tugs at the bottom of a hanging map which is like a window shade
It snaps up revealing a shiny white illustration board A
SECOND AIDE places a large black marker in Bran’s hand and a rag
in case he wants to erase something

BRAN
(under his breath to Marty)
Is this cool or what

He gets up and goes over to the board He illustrates everything
he says in his speech by frantically drawing on the board

BRAN
Okay uh the nucleus has lots of cracks
and fissures We put one warhead about
here and the other about here We
etonate the first one It sends off two
(MORE)

2

BRAN (cont’d)
waves--a surface wave which like it
sounds goes around the surface and a
body wave which goes right through the
center of the coniet Because the body
wave has a shorter distance to travel
it‘ll reach the second warhead before the
surface wave does by my calculations
six milliseconds before So the shock
from the body wave triggers the second
warhead which in turn sends out its own
waves The two waves should come together
right over here directly in line with the
earth When the two waves resonate with
each other it will carve out a huge
crater The recoiling force will be like
a giant rocket engine enough to push the
comet away from its path not a lot
except enough to cause it to come in at a
25-degree angle and miss us

All the faces in the room stare at Bran’s drawing Bran comes
back almost sheepishly and sits down

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Dr Tarnauer you‘ve checked this out

TARNAUER
We ran multiple independent reviews It’s
been flogged by the blast gurus at Sandia
a and Alamos It checks out
MARTY

(whispering)
This is cool

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
You fully support this

TARNAUER
I’m betting my life on it

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
I guess we all are

GENERAL BLOCK

I hate to piss in the soup son We don’t
have anything close to a 50-megaton
warhead
BRAN
(to Marty)

You tell them Marty
to the group)
He does speak

3

MARTY
That’s true Generai we don’t The
Russians do Code name Tsar Bamba three
stage weapon 50 megatons detonated
October 1961

GENERAL BLOCK
That’s highly classified

BRAN
It’s been on the Internet for years

GENERAL BLOCK
(to himself)
Shit

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
1961 was a long time ago We don’t know
if they still have them Right now I
dont know if they could find the keys to
a tank

BRAN
I bet they haven’t thrown the warheads
away

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
How are these warheads supposed to be
delivered to the comet

BRAN
Wellthere’s no way around it You have
to send some guys out there

BRIEFING ROOM - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

We see the guys that Bran is talking about Will Cole
Kunetka Picket and the rest of the flight crews are seated
together They are staring with a look that can charitably be
described as skepticism Bran and Marty are bathed in bright
light They are seated on a stage along with Tarnauer and Lew
Bondy as well as some senior NASA engineers Bran opens a
floppy athletic bag that he puts on the dais He removes a large
model of the shuttle attached to the big orange E-tank with
the two white solid boosters It is the way the shuttle looks at
a normal launch

He uses the model to demonstrate each facet of his explanation

BRAN
I uh got this at the souvenir shop
(pause
So here’s what we have A shuttle that
can’t go farther than earth orbit because
it doesn’t have enough fuel Now here’s
what we can do We take a stripped down
(MORE)

‘ BRAN (cont’d)
shuttle--nothing on it-- we take the tiles
off the landing gears--because it‘s not
coming back Now don’t get upset yet We
change the skin of the external tank to a
lithium alloy I figure well have taken
about 100 tons off the whole thing When
we launch after the SRBs are
jettisoned

(he snaps off the SRBs)

we don’t jettison the tank we keep it
and park the whole thing at the MIR Space
Station The next thing we do is send up
a bucket brigade--everything that can be
launched piggy-backed or slingshot into
space with enough fuel to refill the
E-tank Since well already have one
shuttle and a couple of Soyuz spacecraft
docked at MIR we’ll have people to do the
work I forgot to mention that

He reaches in his bag and takes out a bunch of cardboard
cylinders dropping a couple and picking them up again

BRAN
Theres a large pile of paper towels in
the next room Anyway these are the
first stage boosters of MX missiles They
only weigh 80 tons and deliver
600-thousand pounds of thrust each We
need six of them The Russian heavy lift
boosters the Energyas can bring them up

He takes chewing gum from his mouth and uses small pieces of it
to fasten the cylinders to the E-tank model

BRAN
Up at MIR we bolt the solid boosters to
the E-tank Then we launch the final
shuttle This one will carry the two
bombs When it’s up at MIR

He takes two cigars out of the bag and puts them in the open
payload bay of the model shuttle

BRAN

We transfer the bombs to our stripped-down
mission shuttle

Will and the rest of the astronauts are leaning forward now less
skeptical and much more interested

BRAN
We fire the solid boosters which will get
the shuttle out of low Earth orbit and
into deep space to meet the comet

je pulls the cardboard cylinders off the tank and throws them on
the dais

2

BRAN

We jettison the boosters to lessen the
inertia When we get near the comet we
fire the main engines using the fuel from
the E-tank This makes us change
directions slowing our outbound speed
and then accelerate to match the inbound
speed of the comet essentially blasting
back the way we came in one killer burn

The flight crews start to stir

BRAN

I know the Gs will be horrendous--you
people will just have to handle it Now
heres the tricky part Once we’ve caught
up with Bright Angel and are alongside
youll park Youve got to take the two
bombs and maneuver them down to the
surface using a rig I call the Bomber
When you get there youll be inside the
coma so it will be too bright to make any
calculations from earth Youll have to
zap the nucleus with penetrating radar and
analyze its structure Then I can run my
software back here to figure out the exact
fissures and tell you where to place the
bombs Once you’ve placed the bombs and
set the timers you get back to the
orbiter and get the hell away You have
to be at least 100 miles away before you
blow the bombs You rendezvous with MIR
and get in one of the remaining shuttles
and make a normal landing

fhe looks at his audience)
It will work it really will

There is stunned silence Will has his face resting in his
cupped hands His concentration is enough to burn a hole in a
piece of paper

BONDY
Training begins immediately Current crew
assignments as well as backup crews
remain the same with the addition of some
Russian astronauts Discovery will launch
first seven weeks from now Endeavor is
the primary mission ship She launches
one week later in stripped down form We
then have three days I repeat three
Gays to get Atlantis up Shell be
carrying the modified Russian warheads if
the President can get Russia to commit
The plan is called Bright Angel Intercept
and let me tell you once an operation has
aname it’s going to happen

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

The group of astronauts along with Tarnauer and Bondy have
obviously been sitting around a large table for a long time
There is an ocean of crumpled paper on the floor bleary eyes are
being rubbed the fluorescent light is beginning to get to
everyone In the middle of the table is Brans spacecraft made
of plastic gum and paper towel rolls Bran and Marty sit at
the far end of the table

COLE
How are we going to get all that equipment
up there and everything put together in
time Three shuttles in orbit at the same
time all launched in a couple of weeks
of each other

BRAN
(to Marty)
Ive got to take a leak

He gets up and walks out of the room

TARNAUER
We have to do something because Bright
Angel is heading our way and we’re the
only thing that can stop it My theory
is if you’re falling off a building you
might as well try flapping your arms and
see if you can fly

Will is playing with a pencil twirling it between his fingers
absent-mindedly

WILL
I was thinking if early arriving
fragments are going to hit the earth for
72 hours while the crews are working in
orbit there is going to be some pretty
big devastation All ground stations and
tracking could be damaged the atmosphere
ionized--anything could happen The crews
could be completely cut off They have to
be totally self-contained

BONDY
That’s true

WILL
Well if this guy’s analysis can’t be done
until Endeavor reaches the comet and is
inside the coma then to be truly
self-contained someone has to go who can
make that analysis and do it very
guickly Someone who can do the math
onboard who can analyze the configuration
of the nucleus

it
Bran re-enters tHe room

WILL
The diamond cutter has to be there at the
diamond

Bran feels every pair of eyes in the room turn to him He pales

BRAN
Oh shit

WILL
It’s quicker to train someone as a payload
specialist and bring him along than it is
to teach an astronaut everything that guy
knows

BRAN
Oh shit

NASA SIMULATION BUILDING - DAY

It is a huge hangar-sized building with full-sized mockups of
the shuttle used for training In front of one is a large

dais This is a news conference the likes of which hasn’t been
seen at NASA since Armstrong landed on the Moon The three prime
crews and the three back-up crews are on the dais Each is
situated according to mission ie the Discovery Endeavor and
Atlantis crews are separate Seated with the Atlantis crew next
to Stuart Cole is Viera With the Endeavor crew is the other
Russian astronaut Vladimir Tiverzin Each astronaut has his
name on a card in front of him (The back-up crews are a little
off to the side)- Tarnauer Bran and Marty are there along
with Lew Bondy

There is a VIP section and among the dignitaries are Loretta
Saito and Claire Seacord as well as a lot of the families of
the astronauts

REPORTER 1
Colonel Hayden as Mission Commander of
Endeavor--the shuttle that will actually
go out and meet the comet--do you feel the
weight of your responsibility

GEORGE HAYDEN is in the most prominent position of all the
astronauts right next to Bondy

HAYDEN
All of us here at NASA feel the
responsibility This is what we have
trained all our lives for

REPORTER 1
Are you aware Colonel that you are being
written about as Saint George like
the dragon slayer

Hayden shakes his head

HAYDEN
I’m not a Saint Im an astronaut That
is a higher calling

The crowd laughs and applauds From a public relations
standpoint NASA has chosen the right man

BONDY
Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
Mission training begins tomorrow

REPORTER 2
Wait a minute Is that Loretta Saito
seated over there

The huge crowd turns to the VIP section on the side The hoards

of cameras pan around to catch Loretta who is frozen with fear

and embarrassment All the reporters shout questions at the same
time Above them we hear

REPORTER 2
Loretta Loretta How does it feel to
have your name on what could be the most
destructive thing in the history of the
human race

Loretta is paralyzed She couldn‘t answer a question like that
in a million years She shakes her head her eyes brimming with
tears She is silently mouthing the words I‘m sorry She
doesn’t know what to do The other reporters shout similar
questions Some security and PR people come to her aid and
shield her She is openly crying now and is mercifully being
escorted away Tarnauer is furious He stands up

TARNAUER
Thank you ladies and gentlemen This
news conference is concluded

OTHER SECTION OF THE BUILDING - DAY

Loretta is being comforted by three people from the NASA public
affairs office away from the retreating press One of them has
brought her a Coke Claire comes up to Loretta and sits down
next to her

CLATRE

Loretta clutching her cup of Coke her cheeks wet with tears
looks at Claire 2

LORETTA
I was so proud when they named it after
me and now

CLAIRE
It’s not your fault Those reporters are
bugs Anyway these people will make it
all work out Believe me I know them

LORETTA

You do
CLAIRE

Yeah I’m Claire Seacord
LORETTA

Your father is Will Seacord

CLAIRE
Well yeahit’s no big deal

LORETTA
Youre wrong Its a very big deal

CLAIRE
He’s only back-up

LORETTA
He’s Will Seacord

Claire shrugs

LORETTA
My dads a tax lawyer

CLAIRE
That’s uh pretty cool

LORETTA
No it’s not except he is He’s always
helped me do what I wanted to do which is
to study comets

CLAIRE
Why’d you want to do that

LORETTA
Did you know that when the solar system
was formed the inner planets like Earth
didn’t have any organic compounds

CLAIRE
Uh no I was sick that day

2

LORETTA
All organic compounds came from comet
impacts millions of them back in the
early days when the sky was filled with
them So all living things on Earth
including you and me are made of stuff
that used to be in comets We are
comets So theyre not just some light
show in the sky like a meteor shower or an
aurora borealis or something

CLAIRE
That’s my name Aurora

LORETTA
I thought you said your name was Claire

CLAIRE
Aurora Claire Seacord Aurora blows for a
name so I told them I was changing it
when I turned ten My dad saw an aurora
from space over Antarctica and said it was
the most beautiful thing he ever sawso
I got the dumb name

LORETTA
My dad saw Loretta Lynne in Phoenix

Premier Dieng It is good to talk to you
I hope all is well

There is a pause and then the Translator speaks

TRANSLATOR
Mr President as you well know the
international Space Treaty prohibits
launching weapons of mass destruction into
space

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
Yes Mr Premier that is true However
every signatory to that treaty with the
exception of China has understood the
extraordinary nature of this crisis We
are doing the opposite of something
belligerent We are trying to prevent
destruction not cause it

TRANSLATOR
Mr President those bombs could be used
to deflect the comet to fall on China We
will not agree to a waiver of the treaty
If you persist in this violation we will
respond by putting up a space station
armed with nuclear weapons

PRESIDENT BARRINGER
(to the Translator)
Talk to your counterpart on the other
end and tell them I want them to
translate exactly what I say so there is
no misunderstanding Okay

The Translator speaks in Chinese for a few seconds She
listensand then nods to the President

KING
What I want to know is why the six pieces
of that thing or fragments as theyre
called are being allowed to fall and hit
us without any effort to stop them Isn’t
it true that millions of people could die
if these things hit a populated area

SCIENTIST
There really is no plan that can prevent
the earlier impacts We can only hope the
effects will be localized and confined to
unpopulated areas Everything that NASA
is doing is concentrated on trying to stop
the comet nucleus from hitting That
would be a cataclysm

it has been known to rain inside the building Discovery is in
the late stages of the stacking operation whereby the shuttle
is mated to its twin Titan 2-C solid rocket boosters and the
normous E tank

INT ORBITER PROCESSING FACILITY (OPF)

Endeavor and Atlantis are being readied for stacking Lew Bondy
is walking through the OPF watching the proceedings He is
with Tarnauer and the Secretary of Defense

BONDY
It takes thirty thousand people to get a
Single shuttle ready for launch There
are over six million parts to check We
have to get three of them ready at the
same time

BURR
Are you really going to be able to do it

BONDY
I think so God I hope so

BURR
Is there anything more that you need

TARNAUER
Ill tell you what we need We need those
goddamn bombs from the Russians Were
sucking air without them Can’t you give
them Alaska or something

EXT RUNWAY - KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - DAY

An enormous Ilyushin IL-76 cargo jet touches down on the runway
its tires making puffs of smoke

EXT TARMAC - KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - DAY

A large group of NASA technicians military and state department
brass are waiting on the tarmac as the huge aircraft comes to a
stop Bran and all of the astronauts are there along with
Tarnauer

The cargo doors open and a large contingent of Russian military
accompanied by a large security squad slowly walk down the ramp
They are escorting the two warheads which are rolled off in
sealed containers like giant sarcophagi An American security
squad falls in around the Russian contingent

BRAN
ShitI was there once I liked Alaska

BONDY
Don’t worry weve got all our states
Im afraid we gave up alot more to get
the warheads

Two cosmonauts have arrived with the Russian contingent They
are walking with security people

BONDY
Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls
those two are Alexei Arbatov and Ivgeny
Schmulevich You are going to get to know
them really well because Arbatov is going
to fly on Endeavor with the bombs

TIVERZIN
They are KGB I know who they are They
have been through cosmonaut training
however they have never flown

BONDY
We know all that It turns out the
Russian high command has refused to give
us the firing codes for the bombs
Theyve given the warheads on the sole
stipulation that their man goes along as a
payload specialist to handle the
detonation

WILT
This is pretty stupid

BONDY
It may be except we need the warheads

COLE oo
This is only adding one more Jiability to
the mission
motioning to Bran)
Things are shaky enough with wonderboy
here except at least he does
something

BONDY
Well he’s got the firing codes and
nothing works without them Once you’re
up there if he gives them to you you can
throw him out the door as far as I’m
concerned

The astronauts glare at the two cosmonauts who are in the middle
of the thermonuclear funeral cortege

by a fairly large security contingent

Suddenly one man breaks through the crowd He is in front of
Stuart Cole before anyone has a chance to see the small black gun
in his hand The gunshots sound like fire crackers four of
them in rapid succession Cole has an almost quizzical look on
his face as the blood spurts from his bullet-riddled chest He
is dead before he hits the ground The security people are on
the man in an instant wrestling him to the ground In the
struggle his hair is pulled off revealing a shaved head

There is pandemonium We can hear him ranting

must accept God‘s will and repent

EMT crews are pushing through the crowd that is screaming and
scattering in different directions Will is spattered with

EXT THE EARTH

Below and ahead coming toward Atlantis over the flank of the
planet is a great blazing wound in the earth’s skin It is just
at the boundary between light and shadow The fireball is so
bright it actually illuminates terrain features for what must be
hundreds of miles around it A roiling fireball already 20 miles
in diameter grows rapidly a monstrous dome of hellish orange

The shock front expands like a great soap bubble outward and
upward through the stratosphere Bursting through the top of the
fireball hurled up beyond the normal limits of the atmosphere
is a super-heated geyser of ionized gas and molten rock

EXT ATLANTIS

As Atlantis is passing over this horrific sight and entering the
terminator between night and day we can see this vicious cloud
billowing up toward the spacecraft It is like a beast that has
taken a swipe at them and its arm is just too short

Ahead of them is Fragment D shrieking toward the atmosphere
like a fiery bullet ready to inflict another wound in an already
bleeding victim

everything gets much brighter in a millisecond Fragment D
plunges into the Caribbean Like a molten fist it punches a huge

The crush of people trying to get out of Cape Kennedy pause long
enough to see a brilliant fireball squatting on the horizon like
a half-risen sun Then a searing arc-light rips through the top
of the fireball leaping upward in a vertical launch of ionized

Plasma like an incandescent blow torch

EXT MARSH HARBOR - ABACO ISLAND

People are staggering out of the burning buildings They look up
in time to see a pale translucent curtain moving toward them at
impossible speed The bottom of the curtain where it touches
the water is a brilliant white and straight as a ruler It
stretches from one horizon to the other It is the mach front of
air It hits the island snapping trees off at the base
Bulldings explode to kindling Cars and people are blown about
Like dry leaves

EXT ATLANTIS

Moving below them is the obscene black flower of the hit Rimmed
in the white of super-heated steam it opens its petals below

them like a leprous rose Out of its center a stamen of
incandescent gas arrows up toward them like a volcano erupting

out of the vast mushroom cloud The flower is 100000 feet high
and already 30 miles in diameter The column of hypersonic gas
blasting out of the middle is double that height tickling the
boundary of space

perspective as the earth turns toward them It throws a long
shadow across the Caribbean in the early morning sun

Will’s reaction is one cf horror He sees something even worse
EXT ATLANTIS

Below them moving outward from the flower too slow to see is a
bright silver line It is an arc as thin and perfect as if
etched in glass The sun is sparkling across the entire gulf in
a broad sheen and this one sharp line of light bounded by a
line of deep blue shadow moves as slowly and relentlessly as the
Minute hand of a gas chamber clock

EXT CARIBBEAN

A 500-foot-long container ship is steaming toward us Behind it
the ocean rises like a serpent We see now that the bright
silver line we saw from space is in fact a wave A wave from
hell The ocean rises in anger

In an instant the container ship is dwarfed like a cork The
wall of midnight blue rises and rises above the ship and we can
hear the crackling thunder of sonic booms as displaced air races
over the crest of the wave at supersonic speed A churning
bright contrail stretches across the top of the wave where the
ocean is literally vaporized in a thundering vortex

The ship is lifted violently Men running on the decks are
thrown to the ground The ship torques and begins to break up as
its stern is thrown above its bow Four hundred feet up in the
air it is twisted and torn apart as if a furious child has
picked up his toy and then thrown it down in anger

The wave looms closer and closer Under the charcoal sky it is
a slate gray monolith looking like a wall of liquid concrete

As it encounters the shallows offshore it humps up on itself
like a giant evil serpent Two hundred feet Three hundred

feet And still going At the shore the edge of the water
pulls away receding hundreds of yards It leaves the inner reef
exposed Fish flop on the sand between the coral heads The
wave 1s voraciously drawing up the water into its towering mass
from two miles out

Claire and Loretta are helping Corey up the stairs behind
Gentling The levels seem to go on and on Looking out through
the open structure they can see the wave a vast gray wall that
is noticeably rising They come out onto the top deck The
wind-blasted crest of the tsunami is still above their eye level
It is howling with fury

CORRY
It’s above us

RAINES
Gotta hope it‘1ll break on the reef far
enough out Come on we gotta tie
ourselves to something

Raines frantically looks around and then opens a locker and
starts pulling out fire hoses

The wave rolls up the shoreline The hotels and condos of Cocoa
Beach vanish under the thundering foam and spray At pad 39A
the group atop the gantry has tied themselves down as tightly as
they can They are bracing themselves for the dreadful impact
that is about to come Everything is vibrating They can feel
the rush of air Claire has her back to the water She squeezes
her eyes shut and won’t look at it She takes her mother’s hand
and holds it tightly As the wave reaches the reef a quarter
mile offshore it topples forward in a perfect arc It seems to
fall forever until hundreds of millions of tons of water pound
down with a force that deafens the people on the gantry making
them scream with the pain and fury of it The ground shudders in
a convulsion The white water thunders forward like a horizontal
avalanche It is a churning writhing mass now half the height
of the gantry tower and faster than an express train

CLAIRE
(with her eyes shut)
I‘m not going to scream I’m not going to
scream

The boiling mass hits the base of the gantry The tower is
jolted and Claire screams She is flung sideways siamming
against the fire hose wrapped around her chest She sees through
the grating floor a white explosion below as the foam fountains
up through the inside of the structure blasting through the
levels It is like a monster oil strike exploding up through a
giant well Several stragglers who were still running up the
last levels are swept away in an instant

The tower wrenches and bends shuddering under the awesome
forces A monstrous geyser of water launches up in front of her
blocking out the world it hits her and she is hammered by the
force There is no more light Everything is gray and opaque
with a primal roar Then almost abruptly the deluge is over

There is that moment when Claire opens her eyes and looks around
first to see if she is really alive She rubs her eyes Corey
is next to her jammed against the railing She isn’t moving
and there is blood on her face from a gash on her scalp Loretta
is gone Gentling is nearby He is coughing There is no land
around the gantry There is simply boiling brown-white foam In
the distance the VAB collapses like a cardboard box It
disappears under the milkshake of churning water Dots on the
roof which are people fall into the maelstrom

The shore-break races inland covering the space center It goes
on over Merritt Island to the mainland The cars on the causeway
vanish in seconds Claire goes to Her mother who is

unconscious

over to her

CLAIRE

GENTLING
No

GENTLING

He didn’t have enough time

Claire wipes the hair out of her mother’s eyes Corey’s eyes
flutter open and she groans

COREY

Claire nods Corey tries to sit up and shrieks in pain
clutching her right arm She expertly palpates her forearm

CLAIRE

Claire shakes her head in fear She hears the sound of a girls
voice from behind the stairwell Claire staggers around the
stairwell and finds Loretta tangled in her hoses Her glasses
are gone and she is half blind Claire takes her in her arms
and both of them start to cry

earth is rim-lit in orange The sky is filled with the blue and
yellow streaks of the fragment tails The nucleus and its
colossal ten-million-mile tail would be a magnificent sight if
it were not for the cataclysm it represents As the shuttle
silently streaks toward the horizon the sun rises from behind
the earth Dawn light sweeps across the shuttle and as if a
window shade were suddenly lifted the MIR Space Station is
bathed in yellow white Its solar panels are wider than the
shuttle is long and they glint like gold dragonfly wings It is
the largest manmade structure in space consisting of three large
cylindrical modules and three long narrow solar wings A Soyuz

nearby looking so different from its two sister ships It has
no tiles It is still mounted on top of the huge E-tank Three

EXT COMPLEX

They are passing over Bosnia when a new sun appears ahead

flaring to life below the horizon Fierce as a welding arc
fragment E passes almost vertically through the atmosphere in
less than two seconds It impacts near the mouth of the don

River 600 miles east of Odessa Will can feel the heat of the
flash through his gold reflective visor

Several smaller sub-fragments come down like buckshot across a
1600-mile radius around the big one Kaliningrad takes a nearly
direct hit as does Budapest from these smaller chunks They
cease to be cities Will looks again in time to see the
fireball of the central strike expanding out of the earth almost
Girectly in their flight path He can see alread that the main

hit from fragment E is bigger than anything he’s seen before It
has punched deep into the mantle of the earth and the gout of
incandescent debris hurled out is almost unfathomable in its
scale He realizes that the fountain of molten ejecta is being
hurled above the edge of the atmosphere out into space He can
see it opening and expanding below and ahead of them as they race
toward it He can see the supersonic shockfront reach the edge
of the atmosphere and punch through it like a bursting bubble

Thats when he realizes they are going to go right through it
The attenuating leading edge of the ejecta spray 15 already 200
miles high and still climbing So thin he can see the earth
through it he knows it consists of molten rock and dust
traveling at hypersonic speed Soon it is a transparent curtain
of white and orange expanding across his field of vision right
ahead A ghostly veilfull of whizzing molten tracer bullets
Atlantis below him shields him from impact of microscopic dust

MIR is hit Spektr the new biomedical module takes a strike
from one of the orange tracers There is a flash and glittering
chunks of insulation blow out in a cloud leaving a gaping hole
ten feet across

Will can see tiny flashes like fireflies on the underside of
Endeavor Grains the size of sugar granules pockmarking the
metal They are being sandblasted Bran clinging to his
handhold watches the bullets flashing past all around him He
is hyperventilating gasping rapidly for breath

BRAN
This is bad This is bad This is bad

One of the tracers hits the SRB right in front of Hayden He has
a quick glimpse of a hole big enough to throw a basketball
through appearing in a flash blowing shrapnel toward him Then
chunks of metal rip into him like machine gun rounds also
blasting chunks out of his PLSS backpack His 02 tank ruptures
and the explosion blows Haydens body clean out of his foot
restraints The dragonslayer the hero of humanity cartwheels
away into the void like a discarded rag doll A larger tracer a
molten blob the size of a marble hits Atlantis just below its
vertical stabilizer The RCS fuel and oxidizer tanks are blown
open and the fuel explodes

There is a brilliant orange flash and then everything starts
moving Will sees Atlantis begin a slow cartwheel tumbling out
ef control The MX-SRB still attached to the arm swings
directly toward him He can see the two astronauts attached to
it Strauss and Ramsey jerked like tether balls bouncing off
the casing One of MIR’s solar wings is hit A flash then a
huge plane of silver is tumbling away Inside Atlantis Viera
hears a shrieking hiss and knows they have been holed She can
already feel her ears popping from the depressurization

Outside not ten feet from Will Tiverzin is crushed between the
nozzle of the massive booster and the hull of Endeavor The SRB
smashes his helmet against the hull and swings on missing

Endeavor completely Bran is floating right in the path of the
SRB Will jerks on his tether and pulls Bran out of the way
His arms flailing he crashes against Endeavor and Will makes him
grab onto the underwing rack The SRB sails by them Will can
see the giant spider arm torquing and collapsing as Atlantis
tumbles He looks over at Tiverzin who floats limply ina
constellation of faceplate fragments and scarlet droplets

The whisker-fine orange streaks stop coming at them as abruptly
as they started

On the flight deck of Atlantis Kunetka is working the RCS
controls trying to recover the cartwheeling ship The jets are
not firing because the fuel is gone but he doesn‘t know that
Through the window he can see the MIR complex looming as they
tumble right toward it On the mid-deck Viera and McCusky are
trying to find the leak to slap something over it and control
the depressurization but it is behind a panel They are ripping
at the panel as objects swirl around them

VIERA
Get Brent Tell him to get to the
airlock Were depressurizing and we
can’t stop it

On the deck above Kunetka is panting for breath as he starts
flipping switches to arm the OME (orbital maneuvering engine)
But before he can complete the procedure the MIR station fills
his windows and --

KRUNNCHH They slam into it Not going very fast but with
100 tons of shuttle meeting 125 tons of station the effect is
devastating The cockpit is crushed in on the right side The
view ports shatter and blow out into the vacuum The airblast
jerks Kunetka out of his chair and sucks most of him out through
the gaping front window Will sees his good friend come flying
Out in a blast of gas and twinkling debris He is helpless to do
anything but bear witness to the horror The interior of
Atlantis becomes a blizzard of flying objects as the air rushes
out Then the entire roof of the flight deck is ripped back like
the roof of a car going under a semi trailer McCusky at the
crew deck hatch gapes at the vacuum above him where the roof
used to be He is almost sucked through the hatch and it takes
ail his strength to push himself away from the opening through
which everything not nailed down in the lower deck is whipping
out into the void Viera grabs her bulky EVA suit and
desperately pulls herself with her remaining hand toward the
airlock her legs flapping like a flag Outside the collision
has a devastating effect on MIR as well Two solar wings are
crushed one shearing off at the base and the communications
boom cartwheels away into the void The main crew module is
smashed in causing an explosive decompression inside

The SRB with two astronauts attached is crushed between
Atlantis and the MIR forming a jumble of twisted metal

Strauss his tether snapped spins away into his own orbit around
the earth Worst of all the impact snaps the docking tunnel out

of its mounts and Discovery is suddenly detached Since the
hatches at either end cf the tunnel were left open in the
scramble to shut down the electronics both the MIR and shuttle
are suddenly wide open to the void The tunnel still sticking
out of the bottom of the MIR complex becomes a howling
wind-tunnel as air rushes out of it at hurricane speeds Will
still holding onto Endeavor actually sees a human figure come
rocketing out of the open hatch of Discovery dressed only in
blue flight coveralls The figure jerks spasmodically
pinwheeling its arms and legs swimming through the vacuum of
space Will is just close enough to see that it is Lebow He
helplessly watches the doomed astronaut clawing for a handhold
grabbing something and pulling himself back toward the airlock

He doesn’t make it

that if we sling-shot around the moon we
can meet it on the way back

A single light shines through the rain reflecting on the black
water Claire Genya Corey and Loretta are ina Zodiac with an
outboard motor There is a pathetic piece of plastic that
they’ve thrown over their heads that does not do a lot of good in
protecting them from the downpour Judging from how deeply the
trees are submerged they are in 15 to 20 feet of water It is
other-worldly

crossing space from one side to the other dwarfing the moon

the little boat going forward

It’s a small town A’ couple of stores the sign of an Exxon
Station protruding from the water and the roofs of 15 or 20
houses There is a hill toward the end of the street On top of
the hill is a church and in front of the church is a cluster of
cars maybe 20 As the boat floats nearer we can hear music
and voices coming from the open church door It looks like a
welcomed sanctuary

Above the front door of the church is a large hand-painted sign
on a piece of flapping canvas It reads THE HOUR IS COME
Claire and the others clamor out of the Zodiac and climb the
Stairs to the church door

Claire hurries in and then stops She has a look of horror on
her face The others coming in behind her also stop gaping
Inside the church is a giant screen television set blaring full
volume placed on the altar A choir is singing on the screen
In front of the choir is the Reverend Jimmy Buell looking like
he hasn‘t slept in three days

Lying on the floor and slumped in the pews in front of the altar
are the bodies of the congregation Men women children old
people are lifelessly huddled together Strewn around them are
small paper cups Many of the cups have a green residue By the
television set is a large bowl filled with green liquid On the
floor below the bowl is a tin ef gofer poison with its skull and
cross bones leering at the ceiling a bottle of horse
tranquilizer and a bunch of empty Gator Ade bottle The

The fiery sparks of the torch have cut through the last of the

VIERA
Weve got it We’re on our way in

Viera who is at the end of a long tether that is attached to the
payload bay gives one pull and floats effortlessly back
Arbatov is flying back toward the spacecraft using the thrusters
of his MMU Bran has unclipped his tether and is preparing to
come in and that’s when it happens Alexei pulls back on the
joystick thruster control and nothing happens

ARBATOV
Something wrongvalve stuck open

Viera sees him accelerating toward them building up speed He
is frantically working the MMU controls The thruster is still
stuck full open spewing nitrogen gas

VIERA
(in Russian)
Grab something

Arbatov starts grabbing for part of the spacecraft He barely
gets a hand on part of the payload bay for a split second then
slips off The result is that he is sent spinning The thruster
is still firing so his course becomes even more erratic

Making a desperate grab Arbatov catches Bran’s foot in both
hands as he sails past Bran’s grip is wrenched loose and the
two go tumbling free Arbatov still accelerating loses his
hold on Bran and hurtles right toward Endeavor’s 25-foot high
vertical tail

Wham He slams into it face-first then goes cart-wheeling past
the huge engine nozzles and away from the ship Groggy from the
impact he looks up to see several fracture lines criss-crossing
the faceplate of his helmet He puts one hand up toward

Will hits a switch and the locking clamps are blown away by the
explosive bolts He fires the maneuvering jets and the Bomber
floats free of Endeavor They start the descent to the surface
of Bright Angel They fly over an utterly alien landscape The
ravages of the close pass by the sun have left the comet a
tortured twisted place its surface ripped and exploded
shattered and melted They move from the dark side which faces
Earth to the sunlit side Will avoids the taller geysers but
still feels the buffeting effect The Bomber is unstable and it
is hard work to move the lumbering thing around

Below them a 100-foot-long chunk of icy crust is suddenly blown
out by a pocket of gas beneath Twinkling shards and glassy
sheets fly up past them some striking the lander

WILL
Don’t ever say I don’t take you to
glamorous places Do you know where you
are at all

BRAN
It locks way different from here I
uh shit

WILL

No pressure Tell me when you see
something you recognize

BRAN
(pointing)
Go that way

Bran gets them to the big cleft near the pole Then sees the
crevasse and gets all excited Will makes his approach With a
burst from the descent engine he kills their downward speed and
bumps to a nice gentle landing near the edge of the crevasse

The gravity is very slight barely enough to stick them to the
ground They unclamp their feet They are about to set foot on
a new world Viera is suddenly intensely aware that she is a
Russian and Will an American

VIERA
You go first

He steps off the Bomber and drifts like a feather to the ground
CLOSE ON his feet touching down on the alien ice The first
manned landing on another world since the moon in 1969

WILL
No time for speeches Somebody hand me
the piton gun

Viera and Bran drift down next to him Viera hands Will a
massive torqueless piton gun Will blasts a steel piton into the
ice near one of the lander‘s feet Clamped to the foot is a
tie-down loop a short cable He clips that to the piton with a
Carabiner anchoring the vehicle Meanwhile Bran just looks down
at his feet in wonder standing on an alien world

AT THE EDGE OF THE CREVASSE Will stands looking down It is
about 15 feet across and at least 200 feet deep He can’t tell
if it gets narrower further down Bran comes up next to him
fumbling with a bulky tube It isa rocket-propelled grenade
launcher (RPG) which has been modified to shoot an explosive
expanding-anchor Bran readies the weapon like they showed him
during training He clips a pulley block onto the business end
of the rocket Then he snaps the pulley over the cable between
a bulky spool lying near him on the ice and the length which
goes back to the Bomber

BRAN
You wanna do it

Will takes the launcher and leans out over the edge He aims
deep into the crevasse and pulis the trigger V-WHOOMP The
rocket leaps out and down The cable pays out of the spool like
line from a fly-fishing reel The high-tech harpoon disappears
into the depths of the crevasse lighting the ice as it goes
CRACK The rocket slams into the bottom of the crevasse and the
explosive anchor fires spikes laterally into the ice Will and
Bran return to the Bomber pulling themselves along the cable
and then cut off the cable near the spool They crimp the fee
end to a cleat on the first warhead This completes a loop or
endless cable system The cable runs over a drive capstan
which Viera controls with a hand switch It works like a
breeches buoy or a backyard clothesline At over five tons of
mass the bomb is unwieldy in the micro gravity of the comet
They can’t just push it around or try to carry it because they
couldnt get any traction in the light gravity Will releases a
series of heavy latches and the bomb is free to move

VIERA
(to Viera)
Run the cable out slowly

She does and the bomb slides off its rack hand-guided by will
and Bran They ease it to the ground and Viera winches it to the
edge of the crevasse

With Will talking her through it they inch the massive warhead
over the edge The ice crumbles and Will slips but holds onto
the cable

WILL
Take a mark

VIERA
Mark

WILL

Okay pay out slowly

Viera feeds out more cable The bomb starts its descent into the
crevasse bumping gently down the rough icy wall It hangs up on
a ledge about 50 feet down Will pulls up on the cable by hand
and drags it sideways ten feet then lets it back down The bomb
continues its descent Finally it stops far down in the
darkness

eyes from the flash of the rocket Bran hands him the launcher
and he aims it down the black maw of the tunnel Will has to
brace himself against the wind of methane and CO2 howling from
the mouth of the hole which corkscrews almost straight down into
the nucleus

They are at the second site a venting tunnel on the dark side of
the comet V-WHOOMP The rocket stabs downward ricocheting
off the polished walls of ice and snaking off into darkness The
Cable pays out for a long time then stops As Will crosses
back to the Bomber we get a wider view of the landscape at the
second site Lit now only by Earthlight and the fluorescing gas
cf the coma the black glass landscape is much harder to see

But what we can see is a twisted nightmare of sculpted ice It
is laced with tunnels and in places the surface looks like

EXT BRIGHT ANGEL

THE SECOND BOMB bumps down the glassy wall of the tunnel Chunks
of ice blow up past it carried out of the tunnel by the venting
gases At the surface Bran and Will are guiding the cable as
Viera pays out They hit a snag at 30 metershalfway down
Will and Bran try to free it They pull the bomb up and lower it
again No good It’s stuck

BRAN
Not deep enough The gag won’t work
unless we get it to sixty meters

WILL
Okay then Be right back

Will dives over the edge catching the cable in his hands He
pulls himself down into the windstream hand over hand along the
cable Bran watches him disappear down the shaft In the
tunnel the methane wind howls past Will as he works his way
down It gets darker as the tunnel twists and turns It is an
amazing structureoccasionally opening up into grottoes then
narrowing down to a smaller throat Other tunnels branch off
some tiny some huge Gas jets pour into the main throat from-
some of these tributaries It is like a circulatory system or
giant bronchial tube He hears a crackling in his headset and
bits of words

WILL
Youre breaking up Say again

Deeper now he gets no reply
AT THE SURFACE Bran is starting to freak

BRAN
Will how you doin’ will

VIERA
Will do you copy

BRAN
Damn

He bites his lip knowing Will shouldn’t be down there alone
Knowing that Will’s protective sense of duty would not allow him
to ask Bran to buddy him And that he may be in trouble

BRAN
Ah shit

He grabs the cable and pulls himself down into the tunnel He
has to fight his way down against the wind which buffets him
from side to side

Passing a grotto Bran sees a huge section of the ice wall give
way and go rocketing over his head up the tunnel He goes on
after his buddy

AT THE SURFACE Viera hears a sharp CRACK-BOOM She looks around
and sees a 200-foot shelf of ice blast loose from the surface
nearby It shatters into pieces which tumble up into the sky
What a hellish place She looks at her watch Then looks up at
the earth looming overhead BRAN reaches Will and the bomb

Will smiles when he sees him

WILL
Why Bran how nice to see you

The warhead is jammed at a tight spot Straining together they
try to work the bomb through the narrow throat “No joy Will
clambers past the bomb getting under it He chips away at the
ledge with an ice hammer Bran works it from above The warhead
shifts Then lurches downward

Will is pinned between the wall and the warhead He strains
against it but can’t get any leverage His hands are slipping
on the ice

WILL
I’m stuck

BRAN
Hang on

Bran crawls through a narrow cleft between the warhead and the
tunnel wall The CO2 wind shrieks around him like a gale He is
grunting with the effort but we see that he is not afraid He
is focused He is doing it

He gets under the bomb and wedges himself in next to Will He
starts chopping with the ice hammer trying to widen the space
The wind shrieks past them whistling insanely in the constricted
space

She desperately grabs for his jacket She gets a hand through

completely out of control

She starts the winch Inside the tunnel Will guides the bomb
down through the twists and turns in deepening darkness At 60
meters the warhead stops

BRAN (V0O)
That’s it The position is good

Will pulls himself over the bomb and back up the tunnel He
reaches Bran and they climb together back up the cable toward the
light

Suddenly there is a tremendous concussion Will looks down as
the side wall of the tunnel blows in right below them sending a
ton of ice in glassy slabs and shards rocketing upward in the
vortex of wind Bran is slammed by the ice and dragged scraping
upward over the jagged outcroppings He manages to grab the
cable and stop himself as Will pulls him into an alcove

BRAN
Were not gonna make it

WILL
You complain too much

He starts to climb hauling Bran up the tunnel Ice and chunks
of debris continue to swirl around them from below

WILL
No one said saving the world would be
easy

Near the surface Viera appears next to Will She helps him haul
Bran up the rest of the way and get him to the Bomber

WILL
You secured the cable

Viera wraps her legs around Bran and her arms through the

against the earthwhich now seems to fill the entire sky

Claire is being tossed down the flood water like a rag doll She
‘is beginning to lose consciousness She ricochets off something
solid which spins her sideways toward an embankment Thick roots
are jutting out and with what is clearly her last effort before
giving in to the water she grabs ahold The force of the water
pulls at her shoulders and hands however her will is stronger
than the storm She holds on

A bolt of lightning illuminates the embankment She is in fact
underneath a small bridge With all of her might she claws her
way up the embankment The wind is vindictively slapping her
face She makes it to the top and lies panting on the hard
surface of a road

Behind her a fierce glow appears on the horizon of the road It
comes toward her rising slightly The brilliant flare becomes
two distinct hellish lights Claire turns around and faces the
