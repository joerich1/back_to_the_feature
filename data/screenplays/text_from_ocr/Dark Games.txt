FADE IN

EXT TWO LANE HIGHWAY — PASADENA CA —- NIGHT

A 1967 MUSTANG FASTBACK sits parked on the side of a small
two lane highway just outside a residential neighborhood A
dark figure sits behind the wheel Someone we cannot fully
see

Random CARS drive past the scene

INT MUSTANG

A girly pink KEYRING hangs from the ignition A picture of a
young BLONDE WOMAN and her boyfriend inside the small frame
The girl looks to be high school age

A pair of RUBBER GLOVED HANDS flip through the radio
channels searching for music listening to talk shows He
gives up and pulls the keys out of the ignition

ON THE REARVIEW MIRROR

A pair of dark menacing eyes stare into the rearview mirror
We stay on the mirror as this person steps out of the car

We hear the driver’s door slam shut

THUMP

We watch on from the rearview mirror as this figure walks
around the car and to the trunk He opens the trunk Fast
enough so we can’t get a good look at his face

A few moments pass

A YOUNG BLONDE WOMAN

appears from behind the trunk Her mouth gagged and her
hands tied The dark figure and his hostage begin toward the
woods out of frame and out of our view of the rearview
mirror

EXT MUSTANG - WINDSHIELD

A white piece of paper lays under the windshield wiper It
reads OUT OF GAS
INT WOODS

The gagged woman ruffles through the forestry She cries
out through the cloth

The dark figure walks some distance behind her silent
Suddenlyhe forcefully pushes the girl to the ground

She falls into the mud
SPLAT
She quickly turns around facing her captor

The dark figure kneels down and digs through the filthy mud
searching for the perfect stick or tree branch

He picks up a long thick healthy branch and snaps it in
half He throws the other half back into the dirt and pulls
out a pocket knife

The girl watches on a bit confused

He has a seat on a nearby tree trunk and begins using the
blade to shave the branch down sharper and sharper making a
home made weapon of some sort

The young woman simply watches in horror She attempts to
stand but the dark figure walks over and steps on her back
pushing her face back into the dirt

As the girl lays face down on the ground the dark figure
continues shaving the tree branch down into a sharp spear

The girl watches as shavings from the branch hit the ground
all around her

The dark figure grabs her and turns her over facing him He
points the sharp stick directly at her eye She instantly
turns away

He then rubs the end of the stick across her eye lids as she
SCREAMS out in a panic Afraid that he’ll puncture her eye
the girl tries to lay as still as possible

He simply rubs the stick across her eyes and cheeks taking
in her fear Enjoying himself

Her eyes remain shut scared he will pop one of them out with
his weapon

The dark figure reaches back as if he’s going to drive the
stick into her face Instead he drives it into the ground
as hard as he can

He reaches down and pulls the gag from her mouth She
SCREAMS out in terror

The dark figure slowly slides his hand down the front of his
pants

EXT SIDEWALK - LATE AFTERNOON

Jake now dressed to impress hurries up a residential
sidewalk and approaches a large wooded area He runs down a
small grassy slope and ventures deeper into the woods

INT WOODS

Jake scurries through the small forest maneuvering around
tree trunks and logs pushing his way through the sharp
branches and wet leaves snapping and crunching twigs with
his feet and tramping through the filthy mud

EXT PUBLIC PARK — PARKING LOT

A car pulls into an almost full lot and finds an empty space
Parks

Out of the car steps DETECTIVE DAVID REINHARDT late 40s

graying hair aviator shades cheap sport coat polo shirt
and khakis

He glances around suspiciously as if someone is watching

him He begins into the busy park

EXT PARK GROUNDS

Several retirees are out for their afternoon walk couples
are walking their dogs parents playing with their children

Some of them sitting at various picnic tables others
grilling burgers and dogs on the barbecue pits

Detective Reinhardt notices an unsavory looking fellow with
white hair sitting on the table top of a picnic bench in the
near distance

ARCHIE is old fat and greasy His white hair is spiked up
desperate to appear hip and youthful His silk shirt
designer slacks and fancy shoes suggest money but are a bit
too flashy for the time and place He is busy pounding away
at a hot dog with all the works

Detective Reinhardt begins toward him

ARCHIE
You’re late cop Thought maybe
you were having second thoughts
about that money

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
I had some trouble going on at home
with my daughter

ARCHIE
Trouble eh

Archie laughs

ARCHIE
I bet Girl like that Good
healthy tatas Nice culito AI1l
those hard dicks beatin’ down your
front door I know I hada
daughter myself Never had to
worry like you though She had
the face of a chongo’s culo She
was always home

Archie laughs again

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
I got the twelve hundred

ARCHIE
You waiting on a rainy day lLet’s
see it

Detective Reinhardt pulls a thick envelope from his coat and
hands it to Archie who quickly fans through it counting

Detective Reinhardt looks in both directions making sure he
isn’t being watched

Archie finishes counting the money

ARCHIE
Pretty expensive habit you got
there cop You’re starting to
make me feel guilty You should
start picking your teams a little
more carefully Either that or
start thinkin’ about a career
change

Detective Reinhardt looks as if Archie’s touched a nerve
His mouth quivering just a bit

ARCHIE
(a growing smile)
Wait a minute Could this be
payoff money

Archie slides the envelope under his nose sniffing it

ARCHIE
Hmm Dinero sucio Shame shame

Archie laughs out loud
Detective Reinhardt turns to leave

ARCHIE (0S)
See you next week cop

The detective stops quickly comes back and gets in the man’s
face

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Listen to me I want you to stop
calling the house I don’t wanna
hear from you I don’t wanna know
you exist And the next time you
make threats over the phone at my
daughterI‘ll kill you Theres
plenty of woods around these parts

Archie loses his cocky grin looking very intimidated
Detective Reinhardt walks off
ARCHIE

Hey Dave Tell the wife I said
hi

Detective Reinhardt turns and stares at Archie giving hima
look of pure hate He is so upset Archie’s rendered him
speechless He simply walks off

Archie laughs

INT WOODS

Jake hurries through the forest a bit faster and more
confident now finding his way easier

He stops when he looks up and notices a young BLONDE WOMAN
hands tied to a tree and gagged at the mouth

She stares up at Jake as she cries out in despair

The back of her shirt has been torn all the way up with a
knife

Her bare skin exposed and her bra strap showing

Jake almost doesn’t notice the NAKED MAN standing some
distance behind her He is somewhat hidden from view by the
thick shrubbery but is visibly nude

He is a young thin man in his twenties long curly black
hair So long it curtails his face from view He is
wearing rubber gloves and holding a long blade in his hand
We’ll call him THE SCARY MAN

The scary man uses the knife to rip off the girl’s bra She
SCREAMS out in a panic

Jake slowly backs up distancing himself from the scene
before he’s noticed He trips over a thick log and falls
into the mud

SPLAT

The scary man quickly turns his head staring directly over
at young Jake We only see close ups of his eyes and the
back of his head as he begins toward Jake

Jake quickly stands and darts off deeper into the woods

The scary man charges after him From different camera
angles we see parts of his body as he runs He’s completely

naked His every move is smooth and robotic

Jake is now snapping through the branches hopping from log to
log like he owns these woods

JAKE
HELP SOMEBODY HELP ME
Jake notices a grassy field in the near distance and some
people sitting at a picnic table He runs toward the light
and out of the woods into a picnicking area THE PARK FROM
BEFORE
EXT PARK GROUNDS

Jake trips and falls down a short hill onto the soft grass

JAKE
SOMEBODY HELP

He quickly stands and continues running across the field

Detective Reinhardt is on his cell phone when he looks up and
notices Jake running out of the woods towards him

JAKE
HELP HE’S GONNA KILL ME

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
I‘1l call you back

He hangs up the phone and begins walking towards Jake

Jake runs as fast as he can toward the detective He
approaches him almost completely out of breath

JAKE
There’s a manA man in the
woodsHe’s naked and he’s with

this girl He’she’s attacking
her Quick Call the police

Detective Reinhardt stares in the direction of the woods
DETECTIVE REINHARDT
He was attacking her
INT WOODS

He watches Reinhardt and Jake from a distance

EXT PARK GROUNDS
Detective Reinhardt and Jake

JAKE
Look It’s not what you think He

tree You gotta do something
He’s gonna kill her

Detective Reinhardt loses his slick grin and stares off into
the woods

JAKE
What’re you waiting on man Call
the cops

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Stay here
INT WOODS
Detective Reinhardt ventures into the woods searching for
any signs of foul play He comes across the scene of the

crime and stops in his tracks

There is a large blanket rolled out on the ground A pair of
old sweat pants and a T-shirt lay on the blanket

Detective Reinhardt smiles as he slowly figures it out

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
The little brat scared them off

Detective Reinhardt begins back towards the park but stops
when he notices what appears to be a pair of rubber gloves
tossed into the mud

He kneels down to get a closer look A serious look in his
eyes He cautiously stares all around him scared

EXT PARKING LOT — PUBLIC PARK

passenger side They pull away and begin out of the lot

INT CAR

Jake turns to the detective studying his eyes The
detective appears a bit on edge

JAKE
You saw something out there didn’t

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
What makes you say that

JAKE
You wouldn’t be driving me home if
you didn’t see something So what
was it

Detective Reinhardt stays suspiciously quiet He simply
stares at the precocious teen

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
It might be something it might be
nothing I don’t know

JAKE
Oh I get it That’s on a need to
know basis and I don’t need to
know right

DETECTIVE REINHARDT

DETECTIVE REINHARDT

“was”

JAKE

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
I guess you could say that

Jake looks confused but lays off the detective He simply
stares out the window

EXT HIGHWAY -— CONTINUOUS

Detective Reinhardt’s car pulls out of the lot and back onto
a two lane highway

On the way they pass by a 1967 Mustang sitting idle on the
soft shoulder near the woods

Mustang as they speed off down the road

The Mustang starts its engine and follows shortly behind

awaits her at the foot of the steps

pulling out a 45 AUTOMATIC He checks the magazine for
bullets then slides the clip back in He sets the gun down
on the desk and picks up the phone Cassie interrupts him

Detective Reinhardt awaits an answer from the other line as
he does his best to ignore Cassie

CASSIE

badge You want them to take your
PI license too

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Look I go down there with Jake to

A twelve year old skipping through
the woods and the ex lead
investigator thrown off the case

DETECTIVE REINHARDT

CASSIE
Right And it’s gonna be you and
Joe together again Back on the
streets Until they take his badge

Detective Reinhardt puts his finger to his mouth signaling
Cassie to be quiet

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
(into the phone)

closely He is still chomping away at the jar of peanuts

He is staring back and forth between the television and

Cassie feeling her eyes on him

dinner once About a month ago

Cassie’s eyes widen as she slowly figures it out

CASSIE
Your Matt’s little brother Jake

JAKE
I told you you’d be mad

CASSIE

this I know him and his little
butt buddies at school are planning

sudden some naked guy’s chasing
you through the woods with a knife

JAKE

truth I swear

CASSIE

brother right now

Cassie begins for the kitchen to grab the phone

CASSIE
And he better come pick your ass up
or I’m gonna walk you back home

Cassie grabs the phone from the kitchen counter and dials

JAKE
Don’t you think calling my
brother’s gonna make you look just
a little desperate

CASSIE
What

JAKE
Here you are suspended from school
Your dad took your car keys Most
of the school thinks you’re a bitch
for lying about my brother Now
you’re gonna ask him to come over
If you ask me it seems like a
desperate attempt to get him back
in your life

Cassie hangs up and hurries back into the living room
getting in Jake’s face

CASSIE
Let me get something straight
little man Your brother’s a no
good cheating little bitch If
anyone’s calling anyone back
begging to get back together it’s
him

JAKE
You ever wonder why my brother
stepped out on you in the first
place

CASSIE
Do tell

JAKE
It’s your immaturity You always
picked fights when he called you on
your bullshit

CASSIE
Oh really

JAKE
That way it was always his fault
and you were always the victim My
brother says that’s what spoiled
brats do They whine and pout
until they get their own way

CASSIE
Well your brother’s full of crap
and so are you

JAKE
Youre right Telling the entire
school their boyfriend caught the
crabs from the girl’s soccer coach
isn’t immature at all I stand
corrected You handled yourself
like a true adult

Cassie looks as if she’s ready to slug the precocious teen
JAKE

You think I could get a soda I’m

getting kind of thirsty
Cassie storms back into the kitchen and grabs a twelve ounce
soda from the fridge shakes it up struts back to Jake on
the couch and opens it in his face
SPLASH

The soda explodes all over his face and onto the couch Dark
cola running down his hair and his cheeks

Cassie sets the can down on a coffee table in front of them
CASSIE
Let me know if I can get anything
else for you

Cassie struts off headed up the stairs and out of sight

Jake tries to shake the dark soda out of his hair

INT CASSIE’S BEDROOM

Cassie enters and slams the door behind her She grabs her
IPOD and ear phones Listens to some music as she angrily
paces back and forth

She looks down at one of several torn pictures of her and
Matt still on the bed

She picks it up and places the two halves together She
walks over to a corner desk and tears off a piece of scotch
tape She desperately tapes the two halves back together
EXT BUSINESS DISTRICT

The Mustang slowly cruises through the small business
district hitting a bit of traffic

INT MUSTANG

From the back seat we see the back of the killer’s head He
spots A HOMELESS MAN pushing a shopping cart full of various

garbage down a sidewalk

He slows the car down a bit keeping a steady pace with the
homeless man

The man is dressed in an old wool navy blue suit dirty
white dress shirt and dark neck tie He’s also wearing a
pair of black winter gloves with the fingers purposely cut
off

A dirty hand with long dirt infested fingernails HONKS THE
CAR HORN The scary man

BEEP BEEP BEEP

The homeless man stares over at the driver giving hima
dirty look

The scary man drives up the street a bit passing the
homeless man

He pulls over to the curb with the engine still running

He waits until the homeless man approaches and rolls down the
passenger window

The homeless man stops and curiously peeks into the window

He slowly stumbles over to the car
HOMELESS MAN

Hey man You’re not wearing no
clothes

INT REINHARDT HOME — LIVING ROOM

Jake is absolutely bored as he flips through the hundred plus
channels on television finding nothing He impatiently
tosses the remote down on the couch Huffing in boredom

He looks up and spots a picture of The Reinhardt family
hanging on the wall He walks over and gets a closer look

David and wife are standing hovered over little Cassie age

twelve

Jake looks down at the floor and notices a large laundry
basket He spots some of Cassie’s underwear sitting on top

He looks at the stairs then safely walks over to the basket
Picks up a silky pink thong sitting on top of the stack

JAKE
(whispers)
Whoa

Cassie walks in catching the little pervert

CASSIE

What‘’re you doing with those
JAKE

Now I know what my brother saw in

you

Cassie hurries over and snatches the panties from his hands

CASSIE
Are you done

JAKE

I’m getting hungry You’re supposed

to take me to get pizza

CASSIE
What’re you gonna do Tell my Dad
on me Well guess what

(MORE)

CASSIE (contd)
I don’t really care Tell him what
you want

Cassie begins into the kitchen

JAKE
Why’re you so mean

Cassie stops and begins back to Jake getting in his face

CASSIE
First off you called me immature
Second you’re digging through my
laundry like a little pervert You
need another reason

JAKE
No I mean why are you so angry all
the time My brother says that’s
why you don’t have friends

CASSIE
And what else does he say

JAKE
He says when people try to be nice
to you you push them away

CASSIE
Oh yeah Well if your mother
picks up and leaves without so much
as a note and sticks you with an
alcoholic father let’s see what it
does to your attitude

Cassie storms off into the kitchen

JAKE
I didn’t know

Cassie opens the fridge and rummages through the leftovers
desperately searching for something to eat

CASSIE
How were you supposed to know
It’s none of your business

JAKE
What happened

Cassie angrily slams some boloney and a loaf of bread onto
the counter behind her

CASSIE
Why do you wanna know You gonna
have some smart comment for that
too

JAKE
No I’m just asking

Jake slowly shuffles toward the kitchen closer to Cassie

Cassie grabs a can of beer from the fridge and cracks it
open takes a long rebellious swig

CASSIE
Long story short My dad‘s a no
good degenerate gambler who’s
blown my entire college tuition on
football Around the tenth time he
couldn’t pay his debt they gave up
on threatening his life so they
called the house and threatened me
and my mother instead

JAKE
No kidding You must’ve been real
scared

CASSIE

So after a couple years of non stop
begging and pleading with my
father my mother finally freaks
out and splits She said she’1l be
back when my father straightens his
life out But she never did come
back That was a little over a
year ago What can I say Things
have been just dandy since then

Cassie takes another huge swig of her beer

JAKE
Your dad lost his job didn’t he

CASSIE
How did you know

JAKE
My uncle Dale told me He said
something about him taking some
money once He said that’s the
only way he could ever afford this
nice big house

CASSIE
My mother was a lawyer One of the
best defense lawyers in town
actually I guess that’s where I
get my big mouth from huh

Cassie smiles Nice memories of her mother are coming back

Jack returns her smile

CASSIE
Anyways She won this pretty big
case a few years back Some
malfeasance case for this major
corporation There was a lot of
money involved When they won she
walked away with a big chunk of it
To pay her back they made her
partner at her firm and helped her
buy this place Of course my Dad
used the rest of the money to bet
on football and pay off his other
debts

Cassie slams her beer down and continues digging through the

fridge

JAKE
I’m sorry about your mom

CASSIE
Yeah right

JAKE
No really I mean it And I’m
sorry if I upset you

Cassie slams the refrigerator door shut
CASSIE
You know there’s nothing to eat in

this damn house

JAKE
We could get pizza

Cassie turns and gives Jake the evil eye She slowly cracks

a smile chuckles a bit

CASSIE
What do you want on it

Jake returns her smile

EXT SIDEWALK —- CRIME SCENE

The bum from before is now laying face down on the sidewalk

covered in a white sheet nude and dead

It appears his nose had been broken as blood from his face
seems to have stained the sidewalk His neck has also been

snapped

His shopping cart sits some few feet away still on the

sidewalk where he left it

Yellow crime scene tape is wrapped around the surrounding

trees blocking off the perimeter

Detective Reinhardt and DETECTIVE JOE GRIMES black early

fifties stand hovered over the corpse

DETECTIVE GRIMES

When I heard about your naked perp

runnin’ through the woods I

thought you’d wanna take a look at

this

Detective Grimes pulls back the sheet exposing the

deceaseds bare chest He is nude

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
No clothes

DETECTIVE GRIMES

Looks like he busted his nose open

first with some sort of blunt

object Notice the deep thumb
bruises on the neck He literally
squeezed the life out of this guy
And he did it quickly He was in
and out of here in a matter of

seconds

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Who was he

Detective Grimes stands and grabs Reinhardt’s arm

He pulls

him away from the scene as the two men take a short stroll up

the sidewalk

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Our witness in the sandwich shop
across the street says he was one
of the local homeless His name
was Lucas John Lucas This very
same witness spotted a grey mid
sixties Mustang pull to the curb
around the same time Lucas was
killed

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
So what about the Mustang

DETECTIVE GRIMES
I checked DMV to see if any of our
ladies drove an old Mustang

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Any luck

DETECTIVE GRIMES
No dice

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Missing persons

DETECTIVE GRIMES
I checked recent case files It
just so happens that a Gretchen
Morehouse reported her eighteen
year old daughter Linda missing
some thirty four hours ago Any
guess on the car she was driving

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
A mid sixties Mustang

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Bingo I checked a photo of this
Morehouse girl She’s definitely
our guy’s type Blonde beautiful
popular The Prom Queen killer
strikes again Only this time
Dave it was right in your own back
yard

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
So where are you at on this thing

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Well Our guy’s killed one victim
every month

(MORE)

DETECTIVE GRIMES (contd)
Each one going missing then
turning up dead one to two weeks
later All of them found nude and
face down in the trunk of their own
cars Literally hours after their
death All asphyxiated None of
the bodies sustaining any kind of
visible physical damage That
means he’s holding them for long
periods of time without actually
touching them When he DOES
finally finish the job he keeps it
clean Painless He also makes
sure we find them fast by parking
their cars in public places and
leaving the trunks open

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
So if he’s not interested in sex
why is he leaving them nude

DETECTIVE GRIMES
We have a couple theories One is
he can’t get it up And maybe he
gets himself off by watching The
other is he gets off by humiliating
the victim That he’s undressing
them post-mortem

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
And what do you think

DETECTIVE GRIMES
I think our guy’s trying to tell us
something

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Like

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Like how strong he is That these
prom queen types aren’t worth his
time Think about it Youre this
lonely kid You can’t get laid
Youve been turned down by every
chick in school So you go pick
out the hottest girl in class
stick a knife to her throat and
drag her out into the woods for
some alone time Then you make her
take her clothes off

A woman in

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Only you don’t touch her cos youre
better than she is And you want
her to know it

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Exactly You just watch her beg
You wanna embarrass her and
humiliate her just like she did to
you But he doesn’t do it quickly
He prolongs it It’s like the
longer he goes without touching
these girls the stronger he gets

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
And what better place than the
woods She could scream her lungs
out for hours and nobody would
hear

DETECTIVE GRIMES
And he can’t let her go after what
he’s done So he finds the most
humane way of completing the act
He holds them down until they
simply run out of air

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
When that becomes boring to him

DETECTIVE GRIMES
-He’1l start hurting them for
real I figure it’s only a matter
of time before this kid gets knife
happy

her forties cautiously approaches the men A real

shut in quiet house mother type Her clothes are old and
worn They almost look to have been sewn together with her

own hands
before her

This is JANIS ROOKER Her face is old tired
time

JANIS
(to Grimes)
Excuse me Detective

The two men turn

JANIS
Are you Detective Joe Grimes

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Yes mam What can I do for you

JANIS
My name’s Janis Rooker I live
just down the street I saw the
commotion from the supermarket I
couldnt help but recognize the
shopping cart on the sidewalk

Janis stares down the sidewalk at the body under the sheet

JANIS (0S)
I knew this man Sort of His
name was John right

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Yes mam I’m very sorry

JANIS
My son told me about him once He
would give him money from time to
time After awhile they became
sort ofstrange friends you could
say

Janis tears up as if she’s going to lose it any second
Detective Reinhardt and Grimes share a confused look
DETECTIVE GRIMES
Mam is there something you wanna
tell us
JANIS
This might sound a bit crazy
butI think I might know who
you’re looking for
EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET
THE SCARY MAN now dressed in the wool navy blue suit dress
shirt and tie stands under a corner stop sign staring down

the street at THE REINHARDT HOME

We still cannot see his face just parts of him one piece at
a time

-- The back of his head

-- His black gloved hands with the finger tips cut off His
long dirty unkempt fingernails stick out

-- A pair of dark menacing eyes open wide gazing at the
house in an almost trance-like state

The Mustang is parked against the curb across the street out
of sight

A woman walking her dog comes up the sidewalk As she comes
closer she gets a better look at the scary figure and is
instantly frightened She quickly scoops up her dog curled
in her arms like a newborn baby and begins across the
street

INT REINHARDT HOME —- BEDROOM

Cassie finishes tying her shoe laces grabs a twenty dollar
bill from her dresser and shoves it down her pocket She
leaves

STAIRWAY — CONTINUOUS

Cassie hurries down the steps As she steps into the living
room she hears the sound of a toilet flushing

INT LIVING ROOM — CONTINUOUS

Jake walks out of a nearby bathroom the toilet still
flushing He runs into Cassie

CASSIE
I don’t even wanna know what you

JAKE
Using the toilet

CASSIE
Yeah I bet As soon as my back is
turned God You little whackers
are like machines

JAKE
Youre disgusting Besides You

accommodating

Cassie grabs Jake and walks him toward the door

CASSIE
Let’s go

JAKE
Hey How come we’re not doing
delivery

CASSIE
Because we’re gonna use the change
to rent some movies dumb bell

Cassie and Jake walk out the front door going to get the
pizza

JAKE
Can we rent a porno

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET
From the stop sign at the end of the street we watch CASSIE
AND JAKE walk out the front door and begin down the street
Only this time the scary man is nowhere to be seen
We DOLLY RIGHT moving further down the connecting street
We keep dollying right until Cassie and Jake are no longer in
sight
We move slowly along the curb until we reach the 1967
Mustang parked out of sight The windows are dark tinted
We cannot see inside
INT MUSTANG
SCARY MAN’S POV

He watches as Cassie and Jake reach the stop sign at the
corner and begin down the opposite end of the street

He starts the engine and begins down the street toward them
The two are oblivious ignoring the oncoming car

Instead of following them he makes a right turn and begins
toward The Reinhardt home He slowly approaches the front of
the house and parks

Out steps the scary man
SCARY MAN’S POV

The killer walks across the driveway and around the side of
the house toward the back yard

He approaches a small chain link gate opens and walks into
the back yard

There is a somewhat unkempt swimming pool area A lawn chair
is opened up where Cassie was presumably laying out the day
before He continues to the back of the house and spots the
back door He opens and walks inside

INT REINHARDT HOME — CONTINUOUS

The scary man moves further into the home into the TV room
He stares down at the coffee table and notices only a jar of
half-eaten roasted peanuts

He moves away from the living room and continues checking the
immediate area He stares into the kitchen and notices THE
TELEPHONE sitting on a charger He walks toward it snatches
it up

INT APARTMENT OF JANIS ROOKER

Detective Reinhardt and Grimes have a seat at the dinner
table as Janis brings them coffee

JANIS (0S)
I’ve been following your case very
closely around the time the third
girl went missing

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Courtney Harris

JANIS
Yes I was surprised when the news
kept calling him a sexual deviant
since none of the girls were
reported to have been harmed
sexually

(MORE)

JANIS (contd)
(to both cops)
They weren’t were they

Detective Grimes and Reinhardt share a look

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Besides removing their clothes
they were never sexually assaulted
Just asphyxiated

Janis fades off into a deep trance thinking it all over
Detective Grimes takes notice of her strange behavior

Janis breaks her silence

JANIS
When my Alex was fifteen he was
expelled from school He followed
this girl into the shower room
after class let out He kept her
there for nearly three hours before
someone found them

Detective Reinhardt and Grimes share another look

JANIS
First he barricaded the room so
she couldn’t get out Then he
stuck a knife to her throat and
dared her to scream out But never
touched her Not once Just
watched her beg for her life

DETECTIVE GRIMES
What happened to the girl

JANIS
The janitor found them before he
was able todo anything Because
the girl wasn’t hurt physically and
Alex had no prior record the court
ordered him to a psychiatric hold
for thirty days

Detective Reinhardt listens carefully He’s getting his old
mind set back

JANIS
A lot of good that did When he
was released the doctors couldnt
find anything wrong with him They
said he was a completely sane
healthy fifteen year old boy

Detective Grimes rolls his eyes a bit

disbelief

JANIS They couldn’t explain what
happened Neither could Alex He
told me he couldn’t remember any of
it

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Did you believe him

JANIS
Yes I did It seemed like he was
growing more and more angry every
day This went on for weeks
Until one day something inside him
snapped He just took off with no
warning

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
How long has he been gone

JANIS
It was almost six months ago He
packed some clothes and his camp
gear and left I haven’t heard
from him since

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Camp gear

JANIS
Alex had a tent He used to like
to go camping with his father
before he died To tell you the
truth it was the last time I
remember him ever being happy
When he left he took it with him

shakes his head in

Detective Reinhardt stares off into the distance looking

over Janis

FLASHBACK

Detective Reinhardt spots a Mustang sitting on the soft

shoulder near the woods

Him and Jake continue past the car

EXT RESIDENTIAL SIDEWALK - DUSK
Cassie and Jake strut up the sidewalk headed back to the

house carrying a large pizza and a bag of some rented DVD
movies

JAKE
Why couldn’t we get any scary
movies

CASSIE
Because scary movies are stupid and
senseless

JAKE

humor romance suspense tits and

one That way if you get stuck
watching a chick flick at least

Cassie laughs

CASSIE
You are Matt’s brother aren’t you

Jake looks up and spots the 1967 Mustang sitting at a curb
He stops in his tracks

Jake doesn’t flinch He simply stands in shock staring at
the pink car

Cassie stops stares back at him waiting

CASSIE

JAKE
(whispers)
Come here

CASSIE
What’s your problem

JAKE

Cassie turns and stares down the street

JAKE
Don‘t look

CASSIE
You mean that car on the curb

JAKE
That’s him It’s the man from the
woods I know it is

Cassie stares down at the license tag The word “HOTTIE” on
the front She laughs a bit

CASSIE
Hottie How tough can this guy be

JAKE
It was near the woods Close to
where your Dad picked me up

Cassie turns and looks at the car again

JAKE

Cassie recognizes the license tag on the front of the car

CASSIE

CASSIE
No Actually I heard she missed
the pep rally today
Cassie stares up at the Mustang now a bit scared
CASSIE

Let’s just keep walking But stay
behind me out of sight Okay

Jake nods The two begin up the sidewalk a bit faster this
time

Cassie checks the Mustang car and notices the HEADLIGHTS come
on

CASSIE
Shit Walk faster

Cassie and Jake are now hurrying almost trotting up the
sidewalk

The car pulls away from the curb inching along the side of
the street keeping a steady pace with Cassie and Jake

JAKE
He’s following us

CASSIE
I said stay out of sight

Cassie spots the stop sign ahead Their street

CASSIE
We’re almost there When we get to
the stop sign I want you to run
like hell to the house You got
it

JAKE
I got it

Cassie and Jake are almost to the stop sign as the pink car
slows to a halt waiting for them They finally reach the

corner

CASSIE
RUN 1

Cassie and Jake drop the pizza and movies and make a run for
it down the street headed back to the house

The car speeds around the corner pursuing them
Cassie turns and spots the car barreling towards them

CASSIE
Get on the sidewalk

Cassie and Jake run onto the sidewalk off the street and out
of harm’s way

The car speeds toward them could easily kill them both but
tries not to outrun them He’s simply toying with them

They quickly approach the house and hurry towards the front
door They run inside and lock the door

INT REINHARDT HOME

Cassie and Jake are out of breath hiding behind the door
They peek out the window and spot the pink car sitting
outside with the lights on and the engine running

CASSIE
Come with me

Cassie grabs Jake by the arm as they run into the kitchen A
phone charger sits empty

CASSIE
The phone’s gone Where the hell
is it

Cassie and Jake both notice that the back door is wide open
Someone has broken in They look at each other

JAKE
What about your cell

Cassie grabs Jake by the arm and pulls him towards the
stairs

They hurry up the steps

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
Cassie and Jake run into a nearby bedroom Her fathers
She immediately goes to a corner closet and reaches up as far

as she can grabbing a small leather zipper bag from the top
shelf

She unzips it and pulls out a chrome-plated snub nose 38
caliber She checks the chamber for bullets

JAKE
Are you gonna shoot him

CASSIE
No I’m gonna scare him Come on

Cassie grabs Jake and pulls him with her

INT STAIRWAY —- CONTINUOUS

Cassie and Jake stand in silence neither of them coming up
with any ideas

CASSIE
Okay I know what to do Just

open it Okay

Jake nods

CASSIE
Okay Here I go

Cassie steps out the front door

EXT REINHARDT HOME

Cassie slowly and clumsily begins toward the parked car by
the curb pointing her gun towards it looking very nervous
and unsure of herself

CASSIE

Alright The cops are on their
way So you better leave

The car doesn’t budge one inch

CASSIE
Right now
(beat)
If you don‘tI’m gonna shoot

The car simply sits with the engine running Not moving

CASSIE

The car doesn’t budge

blow your head off

Cassie slowly stumbles over to the parked car her arms fully
extended gun pointed at the windshield

CASSIE
Here I come
(to herself)

Oh God please don’t let me die

Cassie moves closer and closer walking around the car to the
driver’s side

She stares into the open window and sees LINDA MOREHOUSE sitting behind the wheel dead deep thumb bruises on her
neck Choked to death

Cassie backs up a bit in shock

An ARM reaches from under the car and grabs her ankle

Cassie trips and falls to the ground dropping the gun The
gun is tossed a good two feet onto the pavement

The long knife-like fingers of the killer tear at her legs
slicing them up

She struggles to stand as the scary man steps from under the
car He hovers over her

Cassie finally manages to stand and darts back toward the
house

The scary man slowly strides toward her slow enough to give
her a head start

Before Cassie has a chance to beat on the door Jake opens
it letting her in
INT REINHARDT HOME

Cassie heads for the back door to lock it As she passes
through she looks out the kitchen window and spots THE SCARY
MAN passing by

She runs for the back door trying to beat the killer to it
She’s too late

THE SCARY MAN enters holding the 38 snub nose in his hands
He slowly begins toward her He holds out the gun ready to
fire

All the color drops from Cassie’s face She’s a sitting
duck

The scary man twirls the gun around on his finger with the
handle now pointing up and out Pointed at Cassie

Cassie is completely confused by this She simply stands
with the golf club in hand ready to swing

The scary man walks over to the kitchen counter and sets the
gun down with the handle pointed at Cassie daring her to
grab it

He steps a good distance away from it About as far away
from the gun as Cassie is from the gun

Cassie looks back and forth between him and the pistol
contemplating her next move She makes a run for the stares

Cassie darts up the steps with her golf club not looking
back On a wall downstairs we notice the shadow of a man
walking towards the staircase taking his time

Cassie peeks her head around the door frame noticing Jake at
the end of the hall She runs toward him She runs inside
and shuts the door

The scary man struts up the steps taking his time

He steps off and continues down the hall checking each of
the doors They are all unlocked In the other hand he is

carrying the 38 revolver

He continues checking the doors until he’s reached the end of
the hall He grabs the knob and tries to open It’s locked

Detective Reinhardt and Detective Grimes rustle their way
through the dirty wooded area back at the scene of the
crime They come across the blanket spread out on the
ground

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Here’s where the kid found them

Detective Reinhardt looks all around him staring into the
trees

DETECTIVE GRIMES
What’re we doing here again

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
It’s gotta be around here
somewhere

DETECTIVE GRIMES
What has to be around here

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
He had to have been camped here for
the night It’s the woods Hes
out of sight It only makes sense

DETECTIVE GRIMES
Don’t you think he would’ve picked
up his stuff and covered his tracks
by now The kid saw him Hes a
witness

DETECTIVE REINHARDT
Exactly Between me and the kid I
think we scared him off I don‘t
think he had time to come back and
collect his things Just keep
looking

The two men venture deeper into the woods

Detective Reinhardt hurries faster and faster through the
trees Detective Grimes trying to keep up

EXT REINHARDT HOME —- NIGHT

The 1967 Mustang is still parked out front

INT CASSIE‘’‘S BEDROOM

Cassie and Jake are still holding each other tight They’ve
barely budged in hours Day has now fell to night and they
are still waiting in terror

JAKE
I think he might be gone
CASSIE
Maybe Probably I havent heard

anything
Jake slowly stares up at Cassie watching her closely

JAKE
Cassie

CASSIE
Yeah What is it

JAKE
There’s something I should probably
tell you
CASSIE
What
JAKE

My brother never cheated on you
He just told you that so youd
break up with him

Cassie doesn’t quite care at this point She is scared
stiff Almost frozen with fear She simply rolls her eyes
at the young boy

CASSIE
Is that so

JAKE
He wanted to start seeing this
other girl but wasn’t real sure
how to break things off He
figured if he told you he cheated
you’d never wanna talk to him
again I just thought you should
know

CASSIE
(sarcastic)
Oh Okay I feel a lot better
knowing that now Jake Thanks

JAKE
I know it sounds crazy But my
brother didn’t wanna hurt you He
just didn’t want you to think it
was you It was him He just
wants to see other girls That’s
all

Cassie grows angrier with every word from Jakes mouth

JAKE
He doesn’t even believe in
cheating My Dad cheated once
Almost broke up our family I
guess in a wayhe lied for you
To spare you

Cassie squints in confusion

CASSIE
I see Let me see if I can get
this straight So instead of
simply breaking up with meor
being honest and telling me he
wanted to see other peoplehe
decided to kick my heart in and
embarrass me in front of my
friends All because he wanted
tospare my feelings Is that
what you’re telling me

Jake stares at the wall pondering it all

JAKE

Doesn’‘t make much sense does it
CASSIE

Not much No
JAKE

Well I just thought you should

know

Jake stares over at Cassie to see if she’s paying attention
He wants to tell her something It’s on the tip of his
tongue but can’t seem to spit it out Something personal

JAKE
Sometimes I miss my Dad He’s
always working I’m usually in bed
by the time he gets home

Cassie isn’t paying much attention She simply stares at the

floor exhausted

When we do talk all he ever does
is yell at me I get in trouble a
lot at school

This catches Cassie’s attention She can relate

JAKE
My guidance counselor thinks it’s
because of my father He says I
get myself in trouble for
attention He says I like it when
my Dad has to leave work to come
talk with the principal Like Im
getting back at him for not paying
enough attention to me

Cassie looks away from Jake a bit embarrassed

CASSIE
Are you

JAKE
I don’t know I guess in a way I
guess I’ve got a lot of anger
issues Kind of like you Maybe
that’s why you said what you did
about my brother and Mrs Clark
Because you want attention You
want people to feel sorry for you

CASSIE
Oh yeah Or maybe your brother’s
just a creep

JAKE
So what about you

CASSIE
What about me

JAKE
Studies have proven that when
people go through near death
experiences together they form an
unlikely bond They share their
inner most secrets with one
another I told you about my
brother and my Dad So what about
you You have anything to tell me

comes around

CASSIE
I miss my mother Sometimes it’s
hard not having a woman around to
talk to It’s because of my Dad
that IwellI haven’t been too
good with relationships You know
Boys It’s like I have this
unconscious hatred for men It’s
like deep down I know they’re all
gonna grow up to be irresponsible
ass holes like my Dad that drink
and gamble and screw around on
their wives

JAKE
He can’t be that bad

She slowly

CASSIE
My Dad You don’t know the half of
it

JAKE

You shouldn’t be so hard on him

CASSIE
Oh yeah Why not

JAKE
It’s gotta be hard enough on your
Dad being that your Mom’s gone I
think you two should make the best
of things and try to get along
Sure would make things a lot nicer
around the house Instead of
biting each other’s heads off But
what do I know I’m just a kid

Cassie turns to Jake smiles He’s made a great point and
seems to have touched a nerve with Cassie

CASSIE
I wasn’t completely honest with you
about my mother

JAKE
What do you mean

CASSIE
I mean she’s dead

Jake is shocked by Cassie’s secret He simply stares at the
floor

CASSIE
About four months after she split
she was diagnosed with leukemia A
little under a year later she
died It’s like she just couldn’t
take it anymore and her body just
gave out

Cassie huffs in pure disgust
CASSIE
Can you believe that My own

mother was dying and I couldn’t
even be there for her

Cassie shakes her head in bitter disgust Bad memories of
her mother’s illness are hitting her like a sack of bricks

CASSIE

She was always healthy as a horse
Worked out ran three miles a day

Shed never even been to the

doctor Not once They told me
cancer killed my mother but I know

All of the sudden there is the sound of FOOTSTEPS coming down
the hall The floor creaks a bit

face into the wall so hard she can barely catch a breath

INT CASSIE’S BEDROOM

Jake is curled up in the corner still scared to death
Cassie knocks on the door

CASSIE (0S)
Jake It’s me

Jake runs over and opens

JAKE
Where were you

CASSIE
He’s in the kitchen

Cassie immediately shuts the door behind her

JAKE
Then let’s make a run for it We
can go out the front and run to the
neighbors or something

CASSIE
We can’t He’s got the staircase
blocked The front door too Even
if we make it off the stairs we
still have to get past the door

JAKE
What’re we supposed to do We
can’t just sit here and wait for
him to kill us

CASSIE
If he wanted to kill us he
would’ve done it by now

JAKE
So what does he want What is he
doing

Cassies eyes frantically wander around the room going over
ideas in her head She stops when she spots a photo of her
and her father hanging on the wall

CASSIE
Dad
JAKE
What
CASSIE
of course It’s my Dad he wants
Not us
JAKE

I don’t get it I’m the one who
saw him Why would he want your
Dad

Cassie grabs Jake by the hand and walks him over to her bed
They have a seat on the edge

CASSIE
My Dad was investigating this
murder just before he was kicked
off the force A high school girl
(MORE)

CASSIE (contd)
Strangled to death and found in the
trunk of her car She was naked

Jake stares off into the distance piecing it all together

CASSIE
There was this kid who the police
department liked for it An ex
boyfriend of the victim A rich
kid named Danny Myers The media
hated this kid He was really
arrogant and cocky He even
bragged about how he wished he was
the one who killed her The TV and
newspapers made him out to be the
killer before all the evidence was
in

JAKE
I remember It was all over TV
Your dad was the head detective
back then wasn’t he

Cassie nods

CASSIE
They were putting a lot of pressure
on my Dad to put him away When he
couldn’t get any evidence against
Myers to stick they did an
investigation They found out he
took money from this kid’s parents
Twenty thousand dollars

JAKE
They paid your Dad off

CASSIE
My Dad had all these outstanding
football debts He bet a lot back
then Until these men came to the
house one night and told him if he
didn’t come up with twenty grand by
the end of the week my mother and
I would disappear So he told the
Myers for the right price he’d
bury any evidence connecting their
son to the murder He was
desperate He didn’t have a
choice

JAKE
But what about Myers Did he do
it

CASSIE

My Dad never liked Myers for the
killer He always thought the real
guy was more of a loner Not
popular like this other kid
Someone who wasn’t good with girls
Someone who had either killed
before or was gonna kill again
Myers had a clean record He
didn’t fit the profile

JAKE
So what happened to him

CASSIE
To Myers Nothing This same
killer murdered five other girls
since my Dad was thrown off the
force Danny Myers had a solid
alibi for all of them It couldn’t
have been him

JAKE
So the guy I saw in the woods today
was the real killer

CASSIE
He must’ve seen you with my Dad and
decided to follow you home

JAKE
But why doesn’t he just kill us and
get it over with

CASSIE
I don’t know Maybe we’re like his
hostages or something Maybe he’s
planning on using us as bait for my
father One thing’s for sure We
just can’t sit here and wait for
him to kill us

JAKE
So what are we gonna do

CASSIE
If I can make it to the computer I
can myspace some people for help
(MORE)

CASSIE (contd)
They can call the police It’s our
best option

JAKE
Where’s the computer

CASSIE
It’s in my dad’s office near the
steps

JAKE

CASSIE
I know I‘1l have to crawl over

JAKE
But you’re too big

Cassie gives him a dirty stare
JAKE
I meanI‘m smaller I won’t make

as much noise

CASSIE
You think you can make it

JAKE
I can make it A lot easier than
you

CASSIE

Okay Here’s the plan You email

everyone you know Just get
someone to call the cops Youre
gonna be quiet sit and wait And
youre not gonna make a sound
Make sure as soon as you get there
to lock the door

JAKE

CASSIE
Then we wait to see if the cops
show

JAKE

Cassie looks away thinking it over She figures it out

CASSIE
I’m gonna distract him

JAKE
Whatta you mean

CASSIE
I’m gonna go for the garage He’ll
hear the door opening and come
after me That’s when you make a
run for the back door You keep
running to the neighbors and you
call for help

JAKE
What about you

CASSIE
I can probably make it

JAKE
And if you don’t
CASSIE
I can’t think about that now

Okay So is this the plan

Jake stares at the floor a bit unsure He takes a huge
breath nervously exhales

JAKE

over a potted plant sitting on a small end table It
crashes to the floor
CRASH

Goll

Jake panics drops to the ground and runs for the office

Alex reaches his hand through the railing and grabs Cassie’s
leg pulling at her She kicks his hand away

Cassie spots the five iron club still sitting on the steps
and grabs it She holds it like a baseball bat ready to
swing but Alex is gone Nowhere in sight

Jake shuts the office door behind him

INT OFFICE

Jake locks the door and runs over to the computer at the
desk has a seat A bright screen saver glows on the
monitor the system already booted up

Jake grabs the mouse and stares down at the desk Notices a
message written on yellow note pad It says

NICE TRY NEXT TIME YOU DIE

It’s sitting in the same spot where the keyboard used to be
A look of complete panic on Jake’s face

Suddenly Alex breaks open the door and walks in branding
the large steak knife

Jake jumps off his seat attempts to hid behind the desk but
Alex is quick to snatch him up He holds Jake as his
hostage putting the knife to his neck and walking him out of

Cassie spots Alex and Jake walking across the living room and
lays low She waits until they pass by out of view of the
stairway

Cassie then quietly crawls over the railing She drops to
the floor and crawls across it like a soldier in combat
holding the golf club in her arms like a rifle

Cassie peeks around a corner wall searching for Alex and
Jake

She looks into the living room and kitchen They are nowhere
to be found

She slowly stands up keeping her back firmly on the wall
takes another look Still nothing

In the open background we wait for Alex to pop up behind
her We keep waiting but he never shows

Cassie moves back toward the staircase being very slow and
very quiet

She walks around the bottom of the steps and back toward the
kitchen golf club in hand ready to take a huge swing It
is strangely quiet no sign of Jake or Alex

Hiding behind a nearby wall waiting is Alex and Jake The
problem is we don’t know where this wall is Jake’s mouth
has been duct taped shut He can’t make a sound The knife
still to his throat

Cassie moves into the kitchen area She notices the pantry
door is wide open The look on her face suggests Alex is
waiting for her in there

She jumps in front of the door with the golf club A real
threatening stance ready to take someone’s head off

There is no one inside

Suddenly Jake is violently tossed to the kitchen floor His
body flying from around a corner out of nowhere

Cassie is so stunned that she drops the club to the floor
She hurries over to Jake checking on him She rolls him
over and notices his mouth taped up

CASSIE
Jake

Alex hovers behind her knife in hand

Jake looks past Cassie over her shoulder giving her the
signal

Cassie turns around and spots Alex hovered over her

Alex grabs her by the shirt pulling her from the floor He
holds the knife to her throat for a few seconds fueling
Cassie’s fear even more

Cassie is trembling all over her mouth quivering

Alex grabs her by the hair and forces her into the living
room He pushes her toward the couch bending her over the
side

Cassie SCREAMS out in a panic as Alex uses a steak knife to
rip her shirt up the back He rubs the tip of the blade up
her skin as she SCREAMS out even harder

Jake watches in horror from the kitchen He looks to his
left and spots the set of steak knives on the counter top
minus one knife

He runs over and grabs one of them He then hurries over to
Alex and forcefully drives the blade into his back

Alex drops his knife and stumbles away from Cassie He looks
down at Jake and strikes him across the face

Jake falls to the floor grabbing his face in pain

Cassie pulls herself off the couch and turns around with her
lighter in one hand and the can of air freshener in the
other

CASSIE
Hey ass hole

Alex turns around facing Cassie

Cassie lights the small flame and sprays the toxic liquid
onto it creating a kind of home made blow torch

The large flame strikes Alex in the face He grabs his face
and turns away disoriented

Cassie spots the steak knife on the ground and bends over to
grab it

Alex is too fast for her He grabs her by the hair and
forces her into the living room

Alex violently tosses her to the floor grabbing her arm and
pulling it behind her back He forces her onto her knees as
Cassie SCREAMS out

CASSIE
JAKE RUN RUNI

Jake stares at the back door contemplates making a run for
it but doesn’t want to leave Cassie

CASSIE
RUN GET OUTTA HERE

Alex runs his long knife-like fingernails across Cassies
cheek tearing her skin in little bloody streaks

Jake heads for the stairs

want Remember I saw what you
did Come on Come and get me
Alex stops with Cassie and stares over at Jake

rope he found in the debris

car sitting in the driveway

Because after last night youve
learned life is too short and too
precious to hold stupid grudges
against people And sometimes it’s
just easier to admit when you’re
wrong

Cassie smiles
CASSIE

I bet you think you’re pretty
smart don’t you

JAKE
