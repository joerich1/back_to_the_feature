INT EMPIRE CINEMA DAY
The old Empire Cinema on the south coast of England

It is eight o’clock in the morning on Christmas Eve 1980
The building is empty

A dusty morning light falls on the faded magnificence of the
old Art Deco cinema Worn plush carpets sun-bleached
curtains red velvet ropes gilt

We see

- A wide corridor disappearing into darkness At the end of
the corridor a sign reads SCREEN ONE

- The concessions stand - a hexagonal construction of wood
glass and chrome sitting in the centre of the lobby

- Grand twin staircases leading up to other levels Ropes are
hung across both staircases Signs read ‘No Entrance’

- The Manager’s office A cold cup of tea sits on a desk
- A small chrome box office Light streaks in through the

blinds that cover the windows On the small counter -
Christmas decorations adorn an old brass ticket machine

- A wide expanse of glass doors Outside the doors snow
slowly falls on the promenade and seafront

A SILHOUETTE appears at the doors

The silhouette is a woman HILARY - White mid-40s - dressed
in an overcoat and gloves

The jangling of keys as she unlocks one of the doors

She kicks the snow off her boots reaches over to the light
switch and the overhead lights flicker on

INT EMPIRE CINEMA LOBBY DAY

Hilary moves across the lobby She switches on the large Art
Deco bronze chandelier that hangs above the twin staircases

We can now see more of the faded murals and original bronzed
Art Deco fantasia figures that adorn the walls

A detail reads “Find where light in darkness lies”

INT EMPIRE CINEMA LOBBY DAY

She moves behind the concessions stand Turns on the counter
lights Inside the lit glass case - Licorice Allsorts
Revels Chewits Flying Saucers Packs of Silk Cut and John
Player cigarettes

She turns on the lights of a small tinsel Christmas tree

The popcorn machine hums into life

INT EMPIRE SCREEN 1 DAY
The lights come on in sequence in the main cinema

First red lights mark out the aisles and stairs then yellow
and amber downlights rake the walls

We can now see the threadbare Art Deco padded walls the
peeling paint and the faded gold of the auditorium with its
coffered ceiling and ionic columns

In wide shot we see Hilary crossing the large auditorium The
vast empty white expanse of the sixty foot cinema screen
waits behind faded velvet curtains

INT MANAGERS OFFICE DAY

The empty Manager’s Office Hilary enters

She tidies a cold cup of tea from the desk Empties an
ashtray Switches on the desk lamp

From a low drawer she pulls out a pair of men’s suede
slippers Places them carefully next to the chair Turns on
the electric three bar heater

INT LOCKER ROOM DAY

A bucket in the corner catches the drips from an overhead
leak

You can still see Hilary’s breath as she changes into her
uniform Purple skirt blue blouse purple waistcoat

Her locker is open behind her
Close on her name badge as she puts on her waistcoat

EXT EMPIRE CINEMA - SEAFRONT MORNING 6A

The snow slowly floats down in front of the entrance to the
building

The lights of the large neon sign flicker on
THE EMPIRE
And below it

SCREEN 1 - BLUES BROTHERS SCREEN 2 - ALL THAT JAZZ

EXT EMPIRE CINEMA DAY 7
The snowy sea front is reflected in the window of the cinema

Hilary steps into the reflection and we see her face clearly
for the first time

The snow falls Solitary people walk along the front
She looks out to sea

Music ends

INT EMPIRE LOBBY DAY 8
It is a couple of hours later The snow has stopped

Hilary is at the concessions stand serving a couple of teens
with their arms around each other

Hilary watches while they chat noisily Her appearance is
muted Her manner is quiet and reserved

TEEN GIRL (BRANDY)
-Sso I said ‘no piss off you
can’t come not if you’re going to
get off with Julie Atkins’ brother
again’ Silly cow

TEEN BOY (RYAN)
Stupid cow

BRANDY
She’s such a cow

She turns to Hilary
BRANDY (CONTD)

Two popcorns please

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 4

HILARY
Of course Anything else

BRANDY
Packet of Opal Fruits

RYAN
And a Rubber Johnny

The girl cracks up

Hilary flushes She turns and busies herself with the
familiar task of filling two small buckets from the popcorn
machine

She steals a glance at the couple as they kiss Their tongues
touch

As Hilary reaches under the counter for the sweets the sound
of a man’s laughter nearby It comes from the closed door to
the back office

She looks up and sees the figure of a man through the
internal window partially obscured by slatted blinds

Hilary turns and finishes serving the teens and they move
off

Now we see the meagre staff all wearing the purple uniforms
JANINE (a weekend goth in her early 20s) and TREVOR (mid
20s skinny shy) tear the tickets

Elsewhere are FRANKIE (awkward bum-fluff moustache
sweatbands) and BRIAN (spotty small tattoo) and FINN (a
chubby long-haired rocker) all in their late teensearly
20s and finally NEIL (bright tall bespectacled mid-30s)
who is manning the box office

As Hilary wipes down the surfaces the closed door opens and
the Manager Mr ELLIS steps out of the back office He is a
handsome man in his early 60s He carries a cup of coffee
Hilary stiffens imperceptibly as he approaches

Ellis walks right by her without speaking

Her eyes flick down as he passes He wears the suede
slippers

and Stephen step out into

Another lobby entirely

43

Dusty light illuminates the long since abandoned wing of the
cinema

STEPHEN
(quietly)
Oh my God It’s a whole other
cinema

HILARY
Used to be four screens

through the old lobby

Old posters lean against the wall A huge old sign reads
“WINES SPIRITS AND BEERS” Dust covers everything

Hilary has her flashlight on as they walk along a dark
corridor

They arrive at a set of double doors

HILARY
Best for last

And she pushes open the doors

INT ABANDONED BALLROOM DAY 45

The noise of the doors disturbs some pigeons who flutter up
to the roof

It is an old ballroom
The huge room is dominated by a large cracked dancefloor on
which lies an ancient baby grand piano Old booths each with

their own table and lamp line the walls

At the far end of the room a bar stretches the length of one
wall Above the bar a large faded mural of a sea serpent

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 20
45

Floor to ceiling windows surround the space on three sides
Through them is an amazing view of the sea the beach and the
front

Morning light streaks through the windows The light catches
the old velvet seats covered in bird lime and the dust
motes swirling upwards in the air

The beauty of the place takes Stephen’s breath away

STEPHEN
Wow What a place

HILARY
I know It really was beautiful

STEPHEN
It still is

Hilary is struck by this She watches Stephen as he gazes
around seeing it through his eyes

They stand there for a moment looking at the faded grandeur
of it all

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
Another world

Something catches Stephen’s eye

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
Oh look at this little fellow

There is a sick or wounded pigeon nestling in an alcove It
makes small coo-ing noises He reaches up

Close As Stephen stretches upwards his shirt comes
untucked and Hilary can see his taut stomach above the line
of his trousers

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
I think he’s broken his wing

Hilary watches Stephen gently cradle the bird
Suddenly the bird flaps wildly Hilary flinches

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
(to the bird)
It’s alright it’s alright
sshhh
(to Hilary)
He needs a bit of help

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 21

INT ABANDONED DINING ROOM DAY 46

A small private dining room just off the ballroom Boxes of
old programmes Film canisters sit on a workbench Upturned
chairs and stools

The pigeon sits on a pile of boxes A first aid box is open
to one side and Stephen is finishing tying a makeshift
bandage onto its wing

It scratches at the bandage with one of its claws flapping
with its other wing Hilary is a little freaked out

HILARY
Oh he doesn’t like it he’s trying
to pull it off

STEPHEN
It’s ok he’s fine

The pigeon settles Stephen holds him out to Hilary

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
Here Hold him

HILARY
Oh no No I don’t like birds No

STEPHEN
Come on Look like this

Hilary hesitantly allows Stephen to take her hands and
gently put them on the bird Before she knows it she is
softly holding him

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
There you go He loves it He
prefers you
Hilary is stupidly pleased She holds him carefully

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
Now

Stephen reaches down takes off his shoe and his sock

HILARY
What you doing

He cuts a couple of holes in the sock with the scissors ties
a knot in the other end and slips it over the pigeon’s head

STEPHEN
Special trick

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 22
46

The pigeon’s head pops out of one hole and its two feet
stick out of the holes at the other end The effect is cute
and comical

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
You can put him down now

Hilary lets the bird stand on the boxes The bird hops
around

Stephen watches Hilary laugh Her face lit up

HILARY
What happens when he needs the loo

They both laugh

INT SUPERMARKET DAY 47

private joke

Hilary watches them

Stephen does a little impersonation of his shuffling
hunchbacked walk Janine stifles hysterics

Hilary continues to watch unamused

HILARY
(suddenly raising her
voice)
It’s just not acceptable

A beat of shock

STEPHEN
Alright it’s there’s no need to
shout

HILARY

It’s completely unprofessional

customers laughing behind their

A pause

HILARY (CONT’D)
Don’t laugh at people

She walks off

EXTINT EMPIRE BOX OFFICE NIGHT 52

It is night The lights of the Empire sign glow and various
New Year’s Eve revellers sing their way along the seafront

We can see Hilary who is inside the box office which is at
the front of the building and faces directly out onto the
street She stares out at the sea front distracted

Nearby Neil is finishing changing the small sign on the back
of the box office wall that announces the day’s movie times
(‘Dolly Parton in NINE TO FIVE - showings at 1230pm 330pm
6pm 9pm’) and changing the letters so they read

‘WELCOME 1981 - HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL OUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS’
Mr Ellis pokes his head around the door

ELLIS
Hilary When you’re done later why
don’t you pop into the office for a
quick drink

HILARY
Oh I don’t know

ELLIS
Come on just for a minute Toast
the New Year

HILARY
Alright That would be nice

Ellis leaves A beat Neil looks at her she avoids his gaze

NEIL
No invite for me I see

Hilary flushes and ignores him
INT MANAGER’S OFFICE NIGHT 53

The lights are off in the office We can see a streetlit
alleyway through the window

Ellis and Hilary are kissing in the semi-darkness In the
background we can hear the bass thump of the movie soundtrack
playing through the wall

Ellis begins to lift Hilary’s skirt She pushes it back down
They speak in whispers

HILARY
I can’t This is all wrong

They struggle a bit more Ellis puts his hand between her
legs

HILARY (CONT’D)
Stop it

She pushes Ellis away pulls her skirt down Ellis stands
there a little breathless

ELLIS
Why Who is this hurting

HILARY
Well your wife for one

ELLIS

ELLIS

(interrupting)
Look Brenda doesn’t know me

tea

(he approaches her begins

kissing her neck)
And you are just the most
wonderful person (kiss) so helpful

towards you(kiss)

He pulls her in to an embrace Hilary is reluctantly allowing
herself to be taken over by it

ELLIS (CONT’D)

»and your arse feels so good in
my hands

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022

Ellis starts to lift her skirt and push her back onto the

desk

She resigns herself to it

INT MANAGER’S OFFICE LATER

exciting new chapter

He lets this hang a moment

Hilary downs the rest of her whisky

INT EMPIRE LOBBY NIGHT 55

She goes behind the concessions stand looks down

below the clock bells start to chime across the town

HILARY (CONT’D)
Listen

They walk closer to the edge of the roof in order to hear the
chiming of the bells They stand listening for a beat

looking out over the sea

HILARY (CONT’D)

(quietly)
Ring out wild bells to the wild
sky
The flying cloud the frosty light
The year is dying in the night

Suddenly distant car horns cheering and above them and all
around them fireworks

The fireworks explode over the rooftops and the front
reflecting in the sea It’s genuinely beautiful

They both stand staring

Hilary turns and takes a long look at Stephen who is
watching the lights cascade around him

Then she takes her life in her hands and kisses him
He is surprised at first but then he reciprocates

They break Stare at each other for a beat She seems as
surprised as him

HILARY
Shit

She turns and leaves

STEPHEN
Where you going

Hilary keeps walking gets to the door Stephen calls after
her

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
It’s alright

But she’s gone

Stephen stands alone with the fireworks still going off
around him

INT DANCE HALL DAY 57
The dance class It is late afternoon and the sun is low
Through the windows we see the dancers spinning across the
floor in a collective amateur waltz It is strangely

beautiful to watch

Through the spinning bodies we see Hilary

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 37
57

This time she is more engaged less self-conscious and lost
in the music We watch her dance for a while

INT CHEMIST’S DAY 58
Hilary is trying out perfumes in the Chemist’s shop

She sprays her wrist and sniffs it Likes it

She looks up On the pavement outside the shop she spots
Stephen presumably heading into work

EXT CHEMIST’SSTREET DAY 59
Hilary exits the Chemist’s holding a small bag Stephen is up
ahead She isn’t quite sure how to play it so she begins to
follow him She walks a few paces behind him willing him to

turn to spot her

As she follows she begins to watch his easy walk his
shoulders his physical beauty

She follows him down some steps and out onto the front

Up ahead Stephen is now walking under the old colonnades
set back from the seafront

Three skinheads (COLIN MIKEY and SEAN) sit in the shadows
smoking holding cans of lager A fourth skinhead (POGO)
dances to his own private music off his head on glue and
marching powder

Colin and Mikey call out to Stephen

SKINHEAD 1 (COLIN)
Oi

Stephen doesn’t respond Behind him Hilary slows

COLIN
OI

Still no response They are walking towards him
Hilary stops and watches Colin and Mikey are now flanking
Stephen They are clearly saying things into his ear but

Hilary can’t hear The atmosphere is threatening

Stephen keeps moving They are beginning to push and jostle
him Sean has joined them

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 38
59

COLIN (CONTD)
Go home then you fucking Coon

They start making monkey noises following him up the street

SKINHEADS
Oo-O00-Oo

As they approach the end of the colonnades one of them trips
Stephen from behind Hilary watches as he stumbles but keeps
walking

Then two POLICEMEN appear up ahead walking towards them down
the slope

The three skinheads spot the police and peel off

The last one left is Colin He says something into Stephen’s
ear and walks away

Stephen walks on

Hilary seems paralysed She stands and watches him go

INT LOCKER ROOM DAY 60
Stephen sits subdued now dressed in his uniform

Hilary has also changed and sits watching him out of the
corner of her eye Meanwhile Norman holds forth to Neil

NORMAN
I told management months ago there
should be a no smoking rule in both
auditoria Smoke compromises the
viewing experience - it ruins the
projected image and it stains the
screen Simple common sense

Hilary is still watching Stephen He doesn’t lift his gaze

NORMAN (CONTD)
--all I’m saying - a certain
degree of specialist knowledge is
essential You need to understand
basic optical and mechanical
principles to be in this game Like
I told Ellis - any old numpty can
sell tickets

Ellis has walked in all business

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 39
60

Her hands reach up and clasp the back of his head

INT ABANDONED BALLROOM NIGHT 64

Stephen enters In the middle of the tiny low-ceilinged room
two enormous 35mm projectors

Pinned to the wall between the projectors a small black and
white snapshot of a little boy about seven years old

Stephen leans in and looks at it but says nothing

Norman enters behind him He pats one of the projectors as
you would a horse

NORMAN (CONTD)
These are my babies Pair of
Model 18 Kalees

STEPHEN
I had no idea they would be so big

Norman hands him his tea

NORMAN
Well that’s just as it should be
You don’t want people to know They
should just see a beam of light
But back here belts straps
pulleys intermittents sprockets
It’s a machine

Stephen gets closer to it squinting to see the workings

INT PROJECTION BOOTH DAY 77

Stephen is looking through an open hatch at the side of the
projector

STEPHEN
What’s this

NORMAN
That’s the carbons

Stephen looks puzzled

NORMAN (CONT’D)

The spark between the carbons makes
the light And nothing happens
without light

He takes out a box of rolling tobacco and some papers

NORMAN (CONT‘D)
Ciggy

STEPHEN
No thanks

Norman rolls a cigarette lights it He opens the little
projection window into the auditorium and blows the smoke out
of the hatch

Stephen is still scrutinising the projector

Amazing

NORMAN
It is amazing Because it’s just
static frames with darkness in
between But there’s a little flaw
in your optic nerve so that if I
run the film at 24 frames per
second you don’t see the darkness

STEPHEN
Wow

He takes a drag of his cigarette
NORMAN

INT SCREEN ONE AUDITORIUM DAY 79

Mr Ellis stands on stage in front of the big screen

officious) from the Mayor’s office He holds a clip-board

Stephen Neil and Janine sit together in the auditorium
watching them Hilary sits one row back half watching
Stephen Norman and the rest of the staff are scattered
about

ELLIS
So on top of giving the lobby a
lick of paint and all the rest
were going to need special
signage red carpet and crash
barriers for the crowd I think the
Mayor’s office will provide some
security Jim

BOOTH

Indeed There will be a small
security detail You can expect the
Mayor of course and his entourage
which is not insubstantial We’re
waiting for confirmation but
guests look to include

(reading from the clip-

board)
Dora Bryan Sir Laurence Olivier
Steve Ovett Dame Flora Robson
Dusty Springfield and possibly
Paul McCartney

Close on Hilary’s locker door The sound of her footsteps as
she enters the room

Leaning up against the locker is a small brown package

man with a speech bubble coming from his mouth

It reads “play me loud

She seems small and vulnerable

The bus stops A MAN gets on - White middle-aged He sits

animal

She is crying

INT EMPIRE LOBBY DAY 103

Close on a large black and white photo in a frame It is of
The Empire in its heyday - probably around 1932 Its signage
reads ‘Refreshments - Wines Spirits and Beers’ On the
hoarding GRETA GARBO in THE PAINTED VEIL Well dressed
crowds surround the box office

Cutting wide we see that the picture is leaning up against a
wall in the lobby Above it Neil and Stephen both stand on
ladders putting up other framed and mounted photographs
They form a kind of history of the Empire over the years

The cinema has been closed for two days while preparations
take place and it is looking pristine

The lobby is a hive of activity Janine Frankie and a couple
of others busy themselves around the place Some WORKMEN are
down at the front polishing and painting the doors

The workmen’s radio in the lobby plays the news on BBC Radio
2 It is the tail end of the announcement of the engagement
of Prince Charles and Lady Diana

INTERVIEWER (ON RADIO)
--Can you take us back to when you
first met

DIANA (ON RADIO)
Yes I certainly can It was 1977
when Charles came to stay as a
friend of my sister Sarah’s for a
shootand we sort of met ina
ploughed field

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022

A small chorus of ‘Aaaah’s from around the lobby

Stephen la

NEIL
That’s so sweet

ughs incredulously

NEIL (CONT’D)
What’s the matter

STEPHEN
What is it with you lot You’re
like my mum Why do you all care so
much about a bunch of random posh
people

NEIL
What do you mean They’re the Royal
Family They make us feel good
Sane

STEPHEN
Sane That’s a laugh To be a
Royal you have to believe that God
put you there in the first place
which makes you bonkers to begin
with

Neil laughs

NEIL
Well when you put it like that

They carry on with their work

EXT EMPIRE DAY

NEIL
You heard from Hilary

STEPHEN
No (beat) It’s been three days

Stephen sits on the steps opposite the cinema that lead down
to the beach looking out to sea He is smoking Behind him
workmen continue to paint the front doors of the cinema The
cinema marquee is blank

Neil joins him holding two mugs of tea He hands one to
Stephen

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 67
104

NEIL
She told Mr Ellis she was taking
some overdue holiday I’m sure it’s
all fine

Stephen senses there is something else He turns and looks at
Neil

STEPHEN
So why am I worried

A pause

NEIL
She had a rough time last year She
had to go away for a while in the
summer

STEPHEN
Why

NEIL
I think things just got a bit much
for her Ended up being rude to a
couple of the customers shouting
at them She was staying longer and
longer at work said she couldn’t
sleep Started doing weird things

A pause

NEIL (CONTD)
Eventually Ellis told us she had to
go into hospital She was away for
a few weeks and when she came back
she was different

STEPHEN
How

NEIL
Just quieter A bit sad

STEPHEN
Did you ask her about it

NEIL
She didn’t want to talk

Stephen takes this in

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 68

INT PROJECTION BOOTH DAY 105
Norman is teaching Stephen to lace up the projector

While Stephen struggles with the cogs and sprockets Norman
smokes and holds forth Norman wears his work coat a brush
in his top pocket

NORMAN

In a perfect presentation the
projectionist does not exist But
make no mistake you are presenting
the picture Changing the reels
controlling the volume all the
rest You’re the last link in the
chain

(to Stephen re the film)
Stop Loop it

(Stephen stares at him

blankly)
Loop it under the intermittent
sprocket or it’ll drag and the
film will snap

Stephen backs up and re-threads the film more loosely
NORMAN (CONTD)
That’s it Now through the second
fire trap
Stephen does so Norman continues
NORMAN (CONTD)
Even if it’s only one person
sitting in there they know they
aren’t alone But you don’t want
them to think about that You don’t
want them to think about anything
really Just watch the film
Stephen finishes lacing the film

STEPHEN
Done

Norman checks Stephen’s work

NORMAN
Not bad at all

He looks at Stephen
NORMAN (CONTD)

You could do this for a living

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 69
105

STEPHEN
Really

NORMAN
Yeah but I wouldn’t recommend it
Youre far too normal
STEPHEN
(smiling)
What do you mean
NORMAN
Well you know fifteen hours a
day on your own in the dark You
can’t be a projectionist and have
any kind of actual life I’m living
proof
He starts to unlace the projector and rewind the reel
NORMAN (CONTD)
But then this whole place is for
people who want to escape People
who don’t belong anywhere else
Look around you

Stephen nods thinks The reel spins

We hear distant sounds of music

INT HILARY’S APARTMENT BUILDING DAY 108
It is dark and smoky inside Hilary’s flat

Loud music is playing Bob Dylan - It’s Alright Ma (I’m Only
Bleeding)

We hear the sound of the doorbell ringing faintly but it is
drowned out by the music

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 70
108

We cut wide to reveal the state of the place There is stuff
everywhere Clothes overturned books food

On the dining table is a white notepad dense with spidery
handwriting Next to that a full ashtray and a half-drunk
bottle of whisky Other sheets of paper strewn about

Hilary stands at the back window staring out into the dusk
She is half dressed in a bra and skirt and is holding her
blouse in her hands She is barefoot She has dark rings

around her eyes She appears to be in a kind of trance

The doorbell rings again She hears it Turns towards the
front window

The music plays

INTEXT HILARY’S APARTMENT BUILDINGWASTE GROUND DAY 109

Stephen walks out onto the waste ground in front of Hilary’s
building turns and looks up at the windows

He stops He sees a figure walk to the window
Hilary stares straight at him Unreadable

Stephen stares back at her He is suddenly scared although
he doesn’t exactly know why

Then Hilary steps back into the shadows

Stephen stands for a beat Disturbed Then he turns and

starts walking back down the sea front

INT HILARY’S FLAT DAY 110

It looks better than it has in years Its long stretches of
chrome have been polished and it is properly lit from the
outside by large arc lights It glows brightly amongst the
dark shapes of the buildings along the front

A large local cheering crowd are outside A few flashbulbs
go off

INT LOBBY NIGHT 112

Inside the freshly-painted lobby is heaving with people
Excited chatter queues for popcorn The staff - all in
freshly pressed uniforms with dickie bows etc - look after
the crowd

We observe Mr Ellis and Brenda chatting and shaking hands
with local dignitaries Jim Booth from the Mayor’s office is
also there

Stephen is selling souvenir programmes with Janine opposite
him tearing tickets

Then a voice from the crowd

HILARY (0S)
My dear young man Don’t you look
absolutely glorious

Stephen looks up to see Hilary She is wearing a blue silk
dress She is heavily made up but her hair is wild and
unwashed

There is something changed in her A manic dark eyed
intensity Stephen feels immediately that something is not
right

STEPHEN
Hilary Hi

HILARY
(loudly to the world in
general)
I know I don’t have a ticket But
that’s alright I work here I
taught him everything he knows

She laughs loudly and moves past him
Stephen laughs uneasily He wants to talk to her but the

crowd is pushing forwards and before he knows it she is
swallowed up

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 72
112

HILARY (CONT’D)
(calling to someone across
the lobby)
Hello my darling

As she walks away from him Stephen can see that the zip at
the back of Hilary’s dress is not fully done up

INT EMPIRE SCREEN ONE NIGHT 113

The auditorium is full the crowd are chatting excitedly and
holding their Gala programmes

A microphone has been erected on stage

stairs onto the stage and into the glare of the spotlight
He holds a small card with a list of names He is nervous

Hudson’s stirring and altogether
terrific Chariots of Fire

More applause

Ellis smiling and relieved heads into the doorway at the
bottom of the steps As he does so Hilary suddenly appears
from the same doorway and walks straight past a surprised
Ellis towards centre stage

The audience settle when they see her anticipating another
speech There is a pause

Stephen watches from the back of the auditorium with Neil

Hilary reaches the microphone and addresses the crowd She is
clutching a folded piece of paper

and as such I thought I might add
a few words of welcome

Hilary’s eyes flick to the side We see what she sees

Ellis is standing in the auditorium doorway unseen by the
audience Janine stands behind him

Ellis frantically mouths at Hilary “What are you doing

Hilary tries to ignore him and turns to continue her voice
shaking

HILARY (CONT’D)
Tonight is a special night More
than ever wewe need to be we
need to feel part of a
communityBlack or White it
doesn’t matter it’s it’s a very
important thing

Stephen watches and holds his breath

The microphone feeds back Hilary looks out across the crowd
A horrible pause

HILARY (CONT’D)
We must celebrate

Nervous coughing and shuffling in the crowd

Suddenly Hilary remembers the piece of paper she is holding
She starts to unfold it

HILARY (CONT’D)
So to mark the occasion I would
like to read a poem which I think
might be appropriate It is by WH
Auden

She clears her throat looks around She reads

HILARY (CONT’D)
“The desires of the heart are as
crooked as corkscrews
Not to be born is the best for man
The second best is a formal order
The dances pattern dance while
you can”

Stephen watches holding his breath

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 75
116

HILARY (CONT’D)

(with increasing feeling)
“Dance dance for the figure is
easy

The tune is catching and will not
stop

Dance till the stars come down from
the rafters

Dance dance dance till you drop”

We see Ellis in the wings Incandescent with rage

HILARY (CONT’D)
(to the crowd)
Thank you

The crowd is somewhat confused but there is a generous round
of applause nonetheless

Hilary walks into the opposite wing

INT LOBBY NIGHT 117

Hilary comes down the stairs into the lobby We can hear the
sound of the film starting inside Screen 1

Ellis storms down the opposite staircase and catches up with
her A few people mill about - ushers local press etc

ELLIS
(a hissed whisper)
What the hell do you think you’re
doing You were not invited to

speak

HILARY
Well it can’t all be men droning
on

Stephen comes out onto the landing and sees Hilary and Ellis
talking in hushed urgent tones But he can’t hear exactly
what is being said

ELLIS
You know how much this meant to me
Hilary You more than anyone And
yet you wilfully try to ruin it

HILARY

Well I’m terribly sorry but you
can’t always have it your own way

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 76
117 117

She goes to leave Ellis grabs her by the shoulder spins her
around

ELLIS
You have a problem do you know
that You need serious help We’ve
all tried to help you but at some
point you have to take
responsibility for your own-

HILARY
(loud)
Oh why don’t you go and FUCK
YOURSELF

Suddenly everyone in the lobby falls silent

Brenda emerges out of the auditorium onto the first floor
landing looking for Ellis

BRENDA
Donald What are you doing Why
aren’t you inside The film’s
starting

Hilary spots her

HILARY
Oh hello Brenda I’ve been wanting
to meet I think about you daily

Brenda looks at Hilary confused

BRENDA
I don’t understand

HILARY
Well so many questions for a
start And so many notes to
compare

BRENDA
I’m stillunclear

HILARY
Mostly about your husband’s sexual
tastes

ELLIS
Hilary for God’s sake

BRENDA

(to Hilary)
What do you mean

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 77
117

ELLIS
Brenda this is nonsense Please
don’t listen to her
Hilary adopts the pose of a classical actor making a speech
HILARY
To fuck or not to fuck That is the
question Whether tis nobler in the
mind to wank him off into his tea
cup or to let him fuck me over his
desk and spoil all his paperwork
A horrible pause
Brenda looks down at Ellis

BRENDA
Is this true

Ellis stands there

BRENDA (CONT’D)
Donald Is this true

Suddenly Neil speaks up

NEIL
Yes

Neil takes a step towards Hilary as if in solidarity
They all look at him

NEIL (CONT’D)
Yes it’s true

Stephen stands half way down the stairs dumbstruck

Norman comes out onto the landing unaware of what’s going
on

NORMAN
(jolly)
Well the first reel’s going off
beautifully

ELLIS
(to Hilary)
What the hell are you doing
HILARY
Telling the truth What a novel

idea

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 78

ELLIS
That’s not the truth I’1l1 tell you
the truth You’re a schizophrenic
Youre a fucking nutter You’re
only working here because I told
the social workers I’d keep an eye
on you You’re unemployable

A pause Hilary stands there staring Everyone is frozen
watching - Neil Norman Stephen

Hilary turns to Brenda

HILARY
If you want to find the condoms
they are in the top left hand
drawer of his desk next to the
Murray mints

And they all continue to watch as Hilary turns and walks out
through the front door

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022

NEIL

windows with a golf club

STEPHEN

What Is that really true

NEIL
Wouldn’t put it past her He’s
called Social Services They’1l
probably take her back into
hospital

STEPHEN
How come he gets away with it It
just seems so unfair

A beat Neil looks at him

NEIL
Look She’s ill Stephen It’s a
serious illness She’s probably
better off in St Jude’s

How can she be better off ina

place

sure you understand that it’s not
your fault

Hilary stares at him for a moment and then suddenly bursts
out laughing

She is doubled over almost hysterical with laughter

HILARY
Oh my darling Stevie Did you take
a guide book out of the library

INT HILARY’S FLAT NIGHT 123
It’s much later Stephen and Hilary are talking

Stephen is sat on the sofa Hilary is manic Energised and
edgy She paces around smoking

We can now see that the living room is in a much worse state
than before Tins of food are upended on the floor and table
On the wall are various illegible scrawls and in large
letters written in lipstick

WOMAN WOE-MAN

Hilary has put a couple of table lights on the floor They
cast strange shadows

Music plays - Joni Mitchell - ‘Don’t Interrupt the Sorrow’

HILARY
I felt loyal to him No idea why

HILARY (CONT’D)
Then she started punishing me She
blamed me for my father withdrawing
his affections I was ‘Daddys
Girl’

HILARY (CONT’D)
When I had my first period she
brought the bedsheets to the
breakfast table

She thrusts the imaginary sheets into Stephen’s face

Stephen is

girl just did’

STEPHEN

HILARY
I used to sit in the back of the
car on the way to school and Id

it and I’d think all I need to
do is to put my hands round there
and squeeze

watching her frightened of her intensity

Suddenly a banging on the door They both jump

VOICE (0S)
Hello Miss Small

They stand for a beat in silence Then the doorbell rings

HILARY

Turn off the music

Stephen turns off the stereo Hilary drops to her knees and
crawls across the floor to the light Turns it off

She crawls to the window Looks out In the darkness we can
see the blue flashing lights of a police car

HILARY (CONT’D)
Don’t speak Don’t make a sound

The sound of footsteps outside in the hallway Then a voice
through the door

VOICE (0S)

Miss Small we’ve received further
complaints from other tenants in

Hilary rolls her eyes and looks upwards towards Flat 5

HILARY

do’

HILARY

room)
And close the door

BANG The front door continues to be battered from the
outside

Stephen moves quickly into the next room He turns and
watches through a crack in the door

We see Stephen’s POV - Hilary walks calmly across the living
room She picks up her handbag and an overnight case

BANG
Hilary puts on her coat
BANG The door is now on its last legs

Hilary pulls out a dining chair so it is in the middle of
the floor and sits on it

She looks like someone calmly waiting for a bus
BANG Finally the lock splinters and the door swings open

A pause CONSTABLE BRAMAH and ROSEMARY BATES stand on the
threshold Another POLICEMAN brings up the rear

ROSEMARY
May we come in

Hilary says nothing

They enter the living room They look around and take in the
mess

The two Policemen look to Rosemary who takes the lead She
talks to Hilary very gently and not unkindly as if she is
speaking to a small child

Hilary remains sitting on the chair very still

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
Hello Hilary

A pause Hilary sits in silence

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 87

Rosemary goes over to Hilary Hilary stands
ROSEMARY (CONT’D)

reads “WELCOME BACK HILARY” There are a few balloons

Someone chucks a handful of coloured confetti

Hilary covers her mouth in shock and surprise She is
genuinely touched

Wait - can you hear that What’s
that noise
They all gradually go quiet and listen

Someone turns the music down

In the distance we can hear the sound of hundreds of engines
getting closer

The staff all come out of the locker room into the lobby to
see what’s going on Norman has come down the stairs from the
projection booth and is standing in the lobby

NORMAN
Motorbikes

A procession of scooters is already in progress along the
front - straight past the front window of the cinema

They all gather to watch as - one by one - a mass of Vespas
Lambrettas and Piaggios pass by the front window

The light catches their gleaming chrome It is an amazing
sight

JANINE
Wow Look at that

The bikes are all festooned and adorned with mirrors The
riders are Mods - they wear Parkas drainpipe trousers
badges bowling shoes

The staff all watch mesmerised as the procession of
scooters goes past

Then above the sound of the bikes and getting closer
horns Klaxons and in the distance chanting

The staff all watch as the energy outside begins to change
Angrier now

Following the motorbike riders are people on foot Skinheads
although not all of them British Movement tattoos and
Harringtons Doc Marten boots and braces There are a few
National Front banners being held aloft and a couple of
swastikas

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 101

The atmosphere outside suddenly feels very ugly
Norman turns to Neil

NORMAN
I think you’d better lock the door

Neil moves towards the door

NEIL
Stephen quick give me a hand

Stephen hurries to the front doors He and Neil lock them
Then outside a couple of the marchers spot Stephen
They shout to each other their voices muffled by the glass
SKINHEADS
Fuck me look at this There’s a
fucking coon in here

They shout to each other

SKINHEADS (CONT’D)
Oi Over here

Several stop and turn and come to the windows holding their
hands up to their eyes to see inside

COLIN the skinhead who we met in the street earlier walks
up to the window and looks inside He sees Stephen and
starts to rhythmically bang on the window

Stephen starts backing away into the shadows The other staff
don’t know what to do

STEPHEN
(quietly to himself)
Shit
Suddenly there are a lot of faces staring at them through the
glass yelling Perhaps thirty or forty silhouetted cutting
out the light

Now they all start banging on the windows The noise is
deafening

NEIL
Hilary Call the police

Hilary is frozen She doesn’t want to abandon Stephen

NB - we see most of what follows from Hilary’s point of view

The pounding on the windows and doors gets still louder The
whole building is shaking

CRASH One of the large windows caves in One of the
skinheads has cut his hand on the glass

SKINHEAD

CRASH Someone has kicked a door in

Then everything happens very fast

Rioters are yelling and coming in through the doors
Skinheads and rioters are inside the lobby

Hilary is screaming at Stephen to run Others are shouting
Stephen tries to escape towards the locker room Hilary
watches as Colin and two other skinheads catch him and drag

him back into the middle of the lobby

STEPHEN
Don’t fucking touch me

Rioters are ransacking the concessions stand nicking sweets
Some of them are kids

The sound of more glass shattering people have broken into
the box office trying to open the till

They are backing Stephen up against the wall He beckons them
on eyes wide

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
Alright come on then you bunch of
fucking cowards

COLIN

Stephen’s eyes are wide with fury A circle of jeering
skinheads surrounds him now They are egging Colin on

STEPHEN
Yeah Why d’you bring all your
friends then Can’t do anything on
your own Get some imagination you
fucking coward

With that Colin launches himself at Stephen A couple of
skinheads join him others scream abuse Mikey is shouting at
Colin to stop and trying to grab him It is chaos

Stephen tries to land some punches He is kicked to the
ground Kicks and punches rain down

Through the group of rioters Hilary can see Stephen silently
staring up at them Defiant

Norman has come out of the back room and is yelling to
everyone that he’s called the police

In the middle of all the chaos Pogo has jumped up on the
concessions stand and is dancing alone to the music in his
head

Neil has an office chair up in front of him and is trying to
push the rioters back out again A rioter grabs the chair
pushes Neil to the ground

Hilary is still shouting trying to fight her way to Stephen

HILARY
Stop Stop Leave him alone

Stephen is now being savagely beaten by three or four
skinheads He drops into a foetal position hidden behind a
crowd of rioters Hilary loses sight of him She is frantic

Then suddenly the sound of Police sirens People start to
scatter Some rioters start to run towards the doors

Hilary desperately pushes people aside to get to Stephen
Colin has completely lost control and is repeatedly kicking
Stephen in the stomach Hilary flings herself on him
grabbing his arms and trying to drag him off

Colin wrestles with Hilary He throws her off him Hilary

falls to the ground winded

Empire of Light - Green Rev 08042022 104
142

Several Police cars pull up outside the doors their sirens
very loud Some police come into the lobby and try to tackle
the last few rioters

Colin tries to make a run for it but is tackled by two
policemen

The rioters have scattered Several policemen have now jumped
out of their cars and are chasing the rest of the rioters
back along the front

Hilary catches her breath pulls herself up and walks over to
Stephen She stops looks down

Stephen lies semi-conscious a pool of blood around his head
and face
