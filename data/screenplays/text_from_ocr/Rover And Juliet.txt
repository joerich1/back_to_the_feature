Rover and Juliet

By

Steven Wolfson and Jed Wallace
INT LIBRARY

Two large wooden doors open into a BEAUTIFUL LIBRARY Bound
leather books sit in mahogany bookshelves Vaulted ceilings
and ornate furniture suggest this place was made very long
ago

The CAMERA slowly approaches a table where a FINELY CRAFTED
BOOK lies open The page reads “Chapter One” and a colorful
illustration shows an Italian town in the hills

Suddenly we HEAR a little voice call us

THE VOICE (0S)
Psst Up here

We look up and see an adorable little bat hanging upside
down in the corner of the library This is FLYER

FLYER
It’s me Flyer

Unable to contain his excitement Flyer swoops down and lands
beside the book He gestures toward the open page

FLYER (cont’d)
Here to read the most romantic love story
the world has ever known
(Hopefully)
Mind if I read with you I love a love
story

The CAMERA moves in closer to the page’s illustration Ina
second or two we are INSIDE THE PICTURE

EXT A STARRY NIGHT IN VERONA

We approach A DELIGHTFUL LITTLE TOWN tucked into a small
valley between picturesque mountains A full moon hangs in
the cloudless sky

FLYER (VO)
Besides this story took place in my
hometown Verona

As we swoop down closer the town’s towers and spires rise to
meet us We circle around THE CATHEDRAL and come in for a
closer look The bell in the tower is ringing Hanging
upside down in the window of the BELFRY is a younger version
of Flyer

FLYER (VO) (cont’d)
I used to hang out in the Belfry

He drops out of the window and flies with us down a
COBBLESTONE LANE lined with homes as pretty as gingerbread
houses Lights flicker in nearly every window
FLYER (VO) (cont’d)
I was just a young whipper-snapper at the
time

As we approach THE PIAZZA where townsfolk happily call out
farewells to one another Flyer bumps into a sign hanging in
front of The Butcher’s Store and knocks himself silly

FLYER (VO) (cont’d)
- working out the kinks in my radar

A moment later Flyer has gotten himself going again and
approaches A BEAUTIFUL VILLA

A GROUP OF BIRDS are sitting on the banister of the balcony
watching something below Flyer lands between a couple of
PRETTY WHITE DOVES and tries to put his wings around them

FLYER (VO) (cont’d)
this was back in my unpopular days

The Doves look at one another clearly frightened of Flyer

FLYER (VO) (cont’d)
back when everyone thought we bats
were scary

IN A FLASH the Doves dart to the other side of the balcony
where they clearly feel a lot more comfortable All the
other birds turn their backs on Flyer and look down into the
street Flyer has to flap up onto the roof of the balcony to
get a view of

A young man looking up to the balcony longingly where a
young woman looks sadly toward the moon These young lovers
are of course ROMEO and JULIET

ROMEO
But soft What light through yonder
window breaks It is the east and
Juliet is the sun

FLYER (VO)
Wait a second

JULIET
Oh Romeo Romeo Wherefore art thou
Romeo

FLYER (VO)
Hey

(Whistling loudly)
Wait a second I said

A GIGANTIC IMAGE OF THE OLDER FLYER steps into our view of
the lovers and blocks it almost completely

FLYER (cont’d)
Wrong-o Cease it Cut
The CAMERA moves back to reveal FLYER standing in front of
the open book in the library The picture on the page is now
of Romeo and Juliet

Flyer takes a step or two away from the book much like a
trial lawyer about to spring a surprise on a witness
Suddenly he turns back to the page and points to the picture
accusingly

FLYER (cont’d)
That is not the most romantic love story
the world’s ever known
(Mockingly)
Oh no no no no no Far from it

The picture on the page of the book becomes animated again
Flyer looks at the young lovers almost disdainfully

FLYER (cont’d)
I mean yes if you’re going to be
technical about it The story you’re
talking about is nice It has its
moments

On the balcony Juliet looks deeply into Romeo’s eyes

JULIET
What’s in a name That which we call a
rose by any other name would smell as
sweet

FLYER
‘Course some of the dialogue’s a little
much if you ask me Now if you want to

see the most romantic story you got
to look
(Pointing to the corner of the
picture)
- down here

The CAMERA now begins to RE-ENTER the illustration where
Flyer has gestured to

FLYER (VO) (cont’d)
-- where only I could see it sitting
up there on the roof

The CAMERA moves slowly down off the balcony down the side
of the building past the swooning Romeo across the street
and down an embankment

FLYER (VO) (cont’d)
This story comes from an entirely
different part of Verona

Our view continues moving down to beside the river where a
handsome golden retriever puppy watches Romeo’s every gesture
with admiration This is ROVER

FLYER (VO) (cont’d)
And involves different characters
altogether

Two other puppies hang out nearby BENNY a goofy looking
basset hound chases his tail in circles kicking up mud
everywhere MERCURY a brown and black bulldog exercises
rigorously further sculpting his already fine-tuned four-
legged physique

FLYER (VO) (cont’d)
Though these characters from time to time
may seem a little familiar

Rover sighs loudly completely oblivious to his friends’ more
canine concerns

ROVER
Oh I wish I was in love

Benny momentarily stops his twirling and looks at Rover

BENNY
Love What do you want to be in love
for Rover All that sniffing each other
and stuff Yeech

ROVER
But Benny then you have somebody and
they have you

MERCURY
You have more than that

ROVER
What do you mean

MERCURY
Rover just think about it would you
Oh sure it’s all fun in the beginning
Candlelight dinners at the cozy trash can
behind the butchers’ Making puppy-dog
eyes at one another But then things
change One thing leads to another
Pretty soon you got a litter full of
problems to worry about

ROVER
I suppose but still I want to be in
love

Benny has resumed his tail-chasing routine Mercury turns to
him clearly annoyed

MERCURY
Benny dog gone it Don’t you know
you’re never gonna catch your tail
BENNY
(Continuing to chase his tail)
Yes I am Yes I am I almost got
it

And he promptly chases his tail right into the river A
second later he comes up for air panicking

BENNY (cont’d)
I can’t swim I can’t swim Mercury

help me

MERCURY
Just don’t panic

BENNY
What do I do

MERCURY
Paddle

BENNY
How

MERCURY
Dog paddle

Benny seems to get the hang of it

MERCURY (cont’d)
That’s it

A moment later Benny pulls himself ashore completely
drenched

MERCURY (cont’d)
What did I tell you But would you
listen No

BENNY
But I almost had it that time I swear

Just as Benny shakes himself off we hear a DEEP AUTHORITATIVE
VOICE

VOICE
And just what are you pups up to

The three young dogs turn and discover a pack of street-wise
dogs who peer down at them sternly One of the older dogs is
clearly the leader This is Rover’s father BIG DADDY
MONGREL

Big Daddy is dripping wet and clearly unamused The younger
dogs leap to attention guiltily
BENNY
(Stammering)
N - nothing Big Daddy W - we’re j -
just -

BIG DADDY MONGREL
Doggin’ it You boys are supposed to be
off collecting scraps

MERCURY
I tried to tell them sir but they
wouldn’t listen

Big Daddy Mongrel gives Rover a disapproving look Rover
lowers his eyes ashamed

BIG DADDY MONGREL
Come here son

Big Daddy Mongrel puts a paw on Rover’s shoulder and looks
into his eyes

BIG DADDY MONGREL (contd)
You’re almost a year old now Don’t you
think it’s about time you start acting
like it

ROVER
I know I know

BIG DADDY MONGREL
Your mother and I got hopes for you You
think I got to be the top dog rolling
around in the daisies No You got to
work for it

MERCURY
He says he wants to be in love Big
Daddy

BIG DADDY MONGREL
What Is that true Rover

ROVER
Well yes

BIG DADDY MONGREL
You spend too much time playing fetch
with Romeo

ROVER
There’s nothing wrong with Romeo He’s
nice to me He brings me biscuits and
scratches behind my ears -

BIG DADDY MONGREL
Well If Romeo is so nice

Big Daddy Mongrel stares at his son truly angry now
BIG DADDY MONGREL
can you tell me why he’s falling in
love

Big Daddy Mongrel points dramatically up to Juliet

BIG DADDY MONGREL
- with a CAT OWNER

ROVER
Juliet owns cats

BIG DADDY MONGREL
Where do you think the Cat-Pulet’s live
boy

Big Daddy Mongrel looks at Romeo disdainfully

BIG DADDY MONGREL (contd)
That boy’s probably got cat hair all over
him by now

ROVER
(Disillusioned)
No

BIG DADDY MONGREL
So let me hear no more of Romeo or love
They are dangerous influences

Rover nods sadly It is like he has lost a hero

BIG DADDY MONGREL (contd)
Now get out there and get us some scraps

ROVER
Yes Father

The three young dogs leave their elders with their tails
between their legs After a moment Rover takes a last look
up to the balcony

ROVER (cont’d)
I didn’t know Juliet owns cats

Our view now begins to focus on Juliet’s window

BENNY
Are you kidding She’s got more cats
than I got fleas

ROVER
Really

MERCURY
Can you believe that Actually liking
cats
INT JULIET’S BEDROOM

Inside Juliet’s window we see that the young lover sits on a
chair crying for Romeo In her sadness she reaches for a
black and white nearly full-grown kitten

MERCURY (0S)
They say she even pets them

Juliet puts the kitten on her lap

MERCURY (0S) (contd)
Sometimes they even sit on her lap

ROVER (0S)
It’s so so tragic

Juliet looks in the kitten’s eyes

JULIET
Oh Juliet true friend Juliet what dost
thou think I should do

LADY AND LORD CAT-PULET two immaculately groomed long-haired
cats sit on Juliet’s vanity table They are the kitten’s
parents When Lady Cat-Pulet hears the girl call the kitten
“Juliet” she shakes her head

LADY CAT-PULET
I still can’t believe that girl named her
pet after herself

LORD CAT-PULET
You have to remember the child’s only
fourteen

LADY CAT-PULET
I’m fourteen too You see me doing
anything so foolish

LORD CAT-PULET
No dear

The human Juliet (hereafter referred to as “Juliet the Girl”)
sets the kitten Juliet (hereafter referred to as “Juliet”) on
her lap Then she takes a tissue and looks longingly out the
window

JULIET THE GIRL
(Sniffling)
Dost thou think Romeo will be true

Below Juliet the Girl’s chair sits DOC a persian cat with
furtive eyes and a manner of speaking very akin to Mae West

When she and the other cats talk near people they do so
under their breaths and it is very clear that humans are not
aware that the animals are talking

DOC
Oh please

Juliet the Girl lets her tissue drop to the ground Doc
picks it up and hands it to Lady and Lord Cat-Pulet on the
vanity table Lord Cat-Pulet is taking the tissues from Doc
and writing on them with an eye-liner Lady Cat-Pulet puts
paw-prints on them using ruby-red lipstick

DOC (contd)
-- doesn’t she know men are dogs

TYGER a ferocious striped cat with a menacing smile sits on
Juliet the Girl’s bed He practices hurling his claws into a
picture of a dog like humans throw darts at a dart board

TYGER
You give men a bad name Doc Only dogs
are dogs

DOC

Maybe baby but every male of every
species has a bit of canine in him Even
you Tyger

Tyger swats a ball of yarn at Doc but she dodges it easily

LADY CAT-PULET
Stop it you two We have work to do

LADY CAT-PULET (cont’d)
Juliet come on These invitations for
the animal ball have to go out tomorrow

Juliet whispers discreetly as Juliet the Girl continues to
cry

JULIET
Mother what am I supposed to do

LADY CAT-PULET
Act prissy It’s every cat’s
prerogative

JULIET
I can’t do that Juliet needs me

DOC
(Mocking)
Needs you Until she’s got a date

JULIET
That’s not true Juliet’s different

Meanwhile TYBALT a dashing young human in his late teens
has come into Juliet the Girl’s room He picks Tyger up off
the bed and throws him into the air As Tyger screeches
horribly and struggles to land on his feet Tybalt laughs
delightedly

JULIET THE GIRL

Tybalt

TYBALT
Oh come now dearest cousin they’re only
cats

Juliet the Girl sets Juliet down and crosses to Tyger

JULIET THE GIRL
They’re more than that They’re my
friends

She pats Tyger on the head

JULIET THE GIRL (cont’d)
You all right little one

Tyger purrs happily Juliet turns proudly back to Doc
gesturing to Juliet the Girl

JULIET
You see how Juliet is different

TYBALT
Well thoust will never guess what I did
find downstairs after the ball

JULIET THE GIRL
What

TYBALT
Evidence that Montagues were there

JULIET THE GIRL
Montagues

TYBALT
Yes come this way and I will show you

Tybalt and Juliet the Girl leave Tyger heads over to the

ball of yarn

TYGER
Come on help me roll this up
JULIET
No
TYGER
Why not
JULIET

I can’t stand yarn

TYGER
How can you be a cat and not like a ball
of yarn

JULIET
I don’t know

She leaps to the window sill and looks outside longingly

JULIET
I like the ball in the sky What do you
call that

LADY CAT-PULET
It’s the moon

JULIET
The moon Oh I think it is so beautiful

TYGER
Beautiful What’s so beautiful about the
moon Next you’1ll be howling like a dog
at it

JULIET
But I think it’s beautiful I do

She looks at the globed lamp posts

JULIET
And the balls of light outside And the
balls that people throw to one another in
the park Sometimes I see balls bouncing
down the street so fast Not like balls
of yarn that roll a couple feet and stop
But balls that go faster and faster
Sometimes I want to chase those balls
Right outside into the big wide world

Lady and Lord Cat-Pulet look at one another concerned Lord
Cat-Pulet clears his throat and gives Doc a look that means
something like “will you talk some sense into the girl”
Doc sets down her work and goes up to Juliet on the window
sill

DOC
Juliet you’re not feeling curious
are you

JULIET
Yes I am

DOC
How many times do I have to tell you that
curiosity kills -

JULIET
But I don’t see why it has to Don’t you
ever wonder Doc what it must be like to
live outside

MEANWHILE OUTSIDE

Rover Benny and Mercury are looking for scraps Mercury
scans the contents of some trash cans they’ve just dumped
over much as a construction foreman oversees a project

MERCURY
Nothin’ here come on

He immediately heads off toward the next alley As soon as
he’s out of sight Benny jumps on top of one of the trash
cans like a western log-roller Rover takes one whiff of the
garbage and grimaces A second later he glances up to a
window It is not Juliet’s window

ROVER
Benny
BENNY
(Trying to balance himself)
Yeah
ROVER

Have you ever wondered what it must be
like to live inside

The sound of the word “inside” literally sends Benny hurling
He falls face first into a barrel A moment later he
reappears covered in goop

BENNY
Inside

ROVER
Yeah

BENNY
You think you’re some kind of poodle or
something

ROVER
No no I just wonder Don’t you ever
wonder
INSIDE
Juliet looks out the window
JULIET
I imagine flowers and sunshine and
leaping in the trees There’d be wide
open spaces and rivers and lakes and you
could go swimming

Doc gives Juliet a look like she has gone completely off her
rocker

OUTSIDE

Rover continues to peer into windows longingly

ROVER
I imagine a fireplace and music and
chewing a shoe There’d be food served
in bowls and I’d wear bells anda
ribbon in my hair

Benny puts a paw on Rover’s forehead to make sure he doesn’t
have a fever

INSIDE

Juliet leads Doc into the kitchen where we see pet dishes on
the floor Tyger tails along behind looking on
suspiciously

JULIET
Don’t you ever get tired of warm milk and
cold tuna and wearing these tight
collars

DOC
But they’re diamond studded You know
how I love studs

JULIET
Call me crazy but in my dreams I see
myself standing on a tall bridge taking
off this horrid collar and throwing it
into the river

OUTSIDE

Rover turns a corner and directs Benny’s attention to a group
of sad and lonely dogs struggling to survive in the street
Mercury looks at his two friends with concern

ROVER
Don’t you ever get tired of dog catchers
and cold nights and digging in the trash

BENNY
I love trash

ROVER
Call me crazy but in my dreams I see
myself settling down to sleep on a satin
pillow beside my master’s bed

INSIDE
Juliet leaps to the kitchen window and looks out

JULIET
That’s what the outside would be a place
where I could be me a place where I
could be

DOC
What

JULIET
Free

OUTSIDE

Rover jumps a short hedge and peers in the front window of a
charming little home Benny is right behind

ROVER
That’s the kind of place that I crave a
place where you don’t even have to be
brave a place where for once I would be

BENNY
What

ROVER
Safe

A dreamy smile spreads across Benny’s face as he gets caught
up in Rover’s fantasy

INSIDE

Doc has nearly the exact same look on her face but Tyger
SCREECHES and brings an end to that

TYGER
It’s not all fun and games out there you
know

JULIET
It isn’t

TYGER

There’s lots of stuff you have to do that
isn’t fun

JULIET
Like what

TYGER
Well like scratching yourself for
instance

JULIET
Scratching myself But whatever for

TYGER
Because you’1l have fleas

JULIET
Fleas My goodness

TYGER
And what’s more

Tyger whispers something in Juliet’s ear that surprises her
OUTSIDE

JULIET
Really

TYGER
Really

JULIET

But I don’t even know what a fire hydrant
is

Mercury SNARLS at Rover as well

MERCURY
Don’t kid yourself home sweet home ain’t
all it’s cracked up to be

ROVER
It isn’t

MERCURY
No

ROVER
Why not

MERCURY

Well because you have to keep yourself
clean

ROVER
Clean What’s that mean

MERCURY
It means you have to lick yourself all
the time

ROVER
Really
MERCURY
And you even have to

Mercury whispers in Rover’s ear Rover turns to him
startled

INSIDE

ROVER
In a box

MERCURY
Inabox

Tyger and Doc lead Juliet back into the bedroom

TYGER
So don’t get yourself all excited It’s
a jungle out there kiddo

OUTSIDE
Mercury and Benny lead Rover back to the trash cans
MERCURY
So don’t go getting a bunch of ideas It
can be war in there buster

INSIDE

As Doc and Tyger go back to work on the invitations Juliet
looks out the window again

JULIET
Still sometimes I can’t help wonder

OUTSIDE

Rover looks up to a window again as Mercury and Benny go back
to scrounging

ROVER
Still sometimes I can’t help wonder

SPLIT SCREEN INSIDE AND OUTSIDE

Both Rover and Juliet look forlornly toward the different
worlds they seek

JULIET
What it would be like

ROVER
What it would be like

JULIET
to live outside

ROVER
to live inside

EXT THE PIAZZA - MORNING

The colorful town square is teeming with SHOPPERS Italian
VENDORS peddle everything from fresh produce to fine
clothing The camera pans down through the crowd until we
are almost ground-level in front of a WATCHMAKER’S KIOSK
Passing by are the legs and feet of busy shoppers

SUDDENLY Rover’s head pops out from under the red curtain
that encircles the kiosk He anxiously looks around making
sure not to be seen

MERCURY
(From behind the curtain)
How’s it look Rover

Rover looks directly across from the watchmaker’s kiosk at
THE MEAT STAND

A FAT BUTCHER is in the process of cutting steaks and chops
for his customers Rover licks his lips

ROVER
Like dinner And then some

With that a GIANT PAW pulls Rover behind the curtain
INT UNDER THE KIOSK

Hiding behind the curtain are Benny and Mercury Big Daddy
Mongrel holds Rover by a tuft of hair

BIG DADDY
This is a delicate operation
boys One wrong move could
land you in the pound

ROVER
(Cocky )
Not to worry Pops

Big Daddy looks at him sternly

ROVER
(Gulping)
I mean Big Daddy

Big Daddy finally puts a relieved Rover down

BIG DADDY
Benny I need you to cause a distraction
Something wild

BENNY
(Still trying to catch his own
tail)
How do I do that Big Daddy

BIG DADDY
Trust me Just be yourself
Mercury you back up Rover
while he’s nabbing the goods

MERCURY
You can count on me Big Daddy
BIG DADDY
Good luck boys Make this old Mongrel

proud

The three dogs head out Big Daddy is clearly worried about

his pups
EXT PIAZZA

Rover and Mercury make their way towards the meat stand
Benny lags behind

BENNY
Something wild something wild

Benny notices a JUGGLER performing for a group of children
The juggler has several red balls in the air Behind him is
a vegetable stand

Benny spots a pile of ripe tomatoes and suddenly has an idea

EXT MEAT STAND

While The Butcher is busy helping his customers Rover and
Mercury sneak up from behind Benny positions himself in the
crowd

Rover waits then gives Benny the signal With that Benny
begins to BARK as loud as he can The crowd of people turn
to look

Amazingly Benny climbs up on his hind legs and JUGGLES TWO
TOMATOES WITH HIS FRONT PAWS People ooh and aah Even
The Butcher watches in amazement Meanwhile Rover jumps up
onto the meat counter and begins pushing steaks and chops
down to Mercury

Benny continues to juggle for the adoring crowd In no time
at all he is up to twelve tomatoes But when Benny goes for
number thirteen they all come tumbling down on his head
Benny is left covered in tomato juice

The crowd sighs and returns to shopping It is then that The
Butcher finally notices what Rover is doing

BUTCHER

Hey you stinky mongrel Those are my
steaks

The Butcher picks up his MEAT CLEVER but just before he can
slice Rover in two

BUTCHER (cont’d)
Aaaaaaah

Mercury BITES him on the leg giving Rover the chance to
escape

EXT PIAZZA

Rover runs through the crowd When he turns for a split
second to see if he’s being chased the terrified pup

SLAMS RIGHT INTO A PAIR OF LEGS A bit dazed Rover looks up
and finds

- ROMEO staring right down at him

ROMEO
Alas ‘tis my favorite stray

Romeo scoops up Rover who still has a steak hanging in his
mouth

ROMEO (cont’d)
Thou art a criminal in need of
a place to hide Come We shall find
you a fine wine to
go with your meal

EXT ANOTHER SECTION OF THE PIAZZA

Mercury and Benny still covered in tomatoes make their way
home

MERCURY
You had to be a hot shot didn’t you
Like a dog juggling twelve tomatoes
wasn’t enough of a distraction You just
had to go for thirteen

BENNY
I like to challenge myself

MERCURY
Believe me Big Daddy is going to do more
than that when he finds out we blew the
caper

EXT WINE KIOSK
Romeo still holding Rover looks through the many wines

ROMEO
Wine seller bring me your most
prized vintage Tonight is a special
occasion

The Wine Seller bows and goes in back Romeo leans down and
whispers to Rover unaware that the dog can understand every
word he says

ROMEO (cont’d)
Can you keep a secret my friend I a
Montague am to marry Juliet a Capulet
in secret tonight at the old church

As if on cue AN EXPENSIVE HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE appears in
the piazza Lord and Lady Capulet step out followed by
their evil nephew Tybalt

Tybalt spots Romeo and throws him a nasty look

ROMEO (cont’d)
Perhaps our marriage can finally bring
this feud between our families to an end

EXT CAPULET’S CARRIAGE

When The Capulets are well out of sight the carriage’s back
compartment pops open and out jumps Tyger He makes sure
that the coast is clear then calls for his henchcats

TYGER
Shake Speare

SHAKE and SPEARE two Siamese cats who bear an amazing
resemblance to The Bard slowly climb out of the carriage

SHAKE
To be

SPEARE
Or not to be

TYGER
Where are the party invitations

Shake and Speare look at one another and shrug

SHAKE
Now that is the question

Frustrated Tyger WHOOPS them both on the head He then
jumps back into the carriage locates the invitations and

throws them down

TYGER
Make sure every animal gets one

The henchcats scoop up the invitations and head off into the
piazza

SHAKE
Friends

SPEARE
Romans

SHAKE

Country mice

SPEARE
Lend me your ears

Tyger shakes his head in embarrassment

TYGER
I gotta get me some new henchcats

Just then Tyger spots Rover in Romeo’s arms The two make
eye contact Tyger hisses and throws the nervous puppy a
look as nasty as Tybalt’s

attack

EXT WINE SELLER’S KIOSK

As Tyger approaches Rover jumps out of Romeo’s arms and

makes a run for it

EXT ALLEY

Rover runs through the piazza and winds up in a dark and
scary alley He comes to a dead end and when he tries to

ROMEO
Hey Where’s thou going

He comes after Rover ready to

turn around Tyger suddenly JUMPS down right in front of him

TYGER
Don’t you know stray dogs
aren’t allowed in the piazza

ROVER
Well um

TYGER
All Id have to do is get the dog
catcher’s attention

ROVER
(Trying to be brave)
Why don’t you leave me alone
I wasn’t bothering you

TYGER
Youre a dog Your mere existence
bothers me

Tyger moves closer menacingly

Tyger raises his razor sharp claws above Rover’s head

TYGER (cont’d)
It’s been a long time since I clawed
anyone Almost a week

MERCURY (0S)

Why don’t you pick on somebody your own

size

Tyger turns to find Mercury and Benny

TYGER

Two against one Not what you’d call a

fair fight

Mercury pushes Benny to the side with Rover

MERCURY
How’s that

TYGER
That’s not fair either
For you that is

Tyger LUNGES at Mercury The two animals literally fight
like cats and dogs rolling all the way back into the piazza
People run and scream to get out of the way

EXT THE PRINCE’S ROYAL BOX

From his seat high above the piazza THE PRINCE notices the
commotion He signals for his PAGE

THE PRINCE
What’s going on down there

PAGE
It looks like a cat and dog fighting my
liege

THE PRINCE
Just what I need More fighting

Noticing that The Prince is agitated a SERVANT races to his
side and begins massaging his temples

THE PRINCE (contd)

As if The Capulets and The Montagues
weren’t enough of a headache Send for
my royal dog catcher to break it up

PAGE

Yes my liege

(Shouting)
SEND FOR THE ROYAL DOG CATCHER

The command is heard repeated by a series of pages until it
reaches

INT THE DOG POUND

The cages are teeming with strays THE ROYAL DOG CATCHER a
tall and sinister-looking fellow dressed entirely in black
polishes his silver dog catcher’s net

DOG CATCHER
(Smiling)
Party time

EXT PIAZZA
Mercury and Tyger are still going at it knocking over
everything in their path With all of his strength Mercury

pushes Tyger to the ground and raises his paw in the air

MERCURY
Say nighty-night Kitty

A GALLOPING SOUND is suddenly heard Rover turns and finds
the Dog Catcher racing toward him on his black horse

ROVER
Merc’ it’s the fuzz

Mercury looks up and sees the dog catcher’s net about to
swoop down on Rover He jumps off of Tyger and pushes his
friend out of the way just in the nick of time The three
dogs make a run for it

EXT MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE PIAZZA

The puppies race to get out of the piazza But The Dog
Catcher is right on their tails whipping his horse to run
faster

BENNY
He’s almost got us

MERCURY
This way

Mercury leads the dogs through a narrow passage between two
kiosks But as Rover tries to escape THE DOG CATCHER GRABS
HIM BY THE TAIL
DOG CATCHER
(ala The Wicked Witch)

I’ve got you my pretty
But The Dog Catcher’s wrong Mercury and Benny pulling
Rover from the other side save their friend Rover’s tail
slips right through The Dog Catcher’s hands

DOG CATCHER (contd)

He watches as the three dogs vanish into the streets

DOG CATCHER (contd)
Next time your tail is mine

EXT OUTSIDE THE PIAZZA

The dogs stop to catch their breath

BENNY
That was too close for comfort
ROVER
Youre telling me Thanks for saving my
tail guys
MERCURY
Anytime

In the gutter TWO RATS hold one of the Cat-Pulets’ party
invitations

FIRST RAT
What are you going as

SECOND RAT
I don’t know I always wanted to be a
hamster

FIRST RAT

A hamster That’s so obvious

MERCURY
What are you rats talking about

FIRST RAT
We just got invited to the social event
of the season Any animal who’s anyone
will be there

BENNY
Hey we’re animals
(Thinking)
Aren’t we

MERCURY
Lemme see that

Mercury grabs the invitation It reads ‘LORD AND LADY
CAT-PULET CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO THEIR COSTUME BALL
PLEASE RSVP PS NO DOGS ALLOWED’

MERCURY (cont’d)
Well if that don’t beat all The furballs
are having a ball And we ain’t invited

ROVER
No big surprise seeing how much they
hate us

MERCURY

Maybe so But if this shindig is good
enough for a bunch of rats

RATS
Hey

MERCURY
--- well then it’s good enough for a
bunch of dogs And I think I know just
how to get even with Tyger in the
process You boys game

ROVER
Absolutely

BENNY
Just as long as I don’t have
to juggle

THE NIGHT OF THE CAT-PULET’S PARTY - MONTAGE
Animals throughout Verona don various costumes
EXT VERONA’S ZOO - MONTAGE

The monkeys swipe the sleeping zookeeper’s keys and let the
other exotic animals out of their cages

EXT STREETS - MONTAGE

A virtual menagerie makes its way through the city toward the
Cat-Pulet’s villa Some of the animals are easy to recognize
under their costumes (the elephant dressed as a kangaroo for
example) while others are completely disguised

EXT VILLA - MONTAGE

Lord and Lady Cat-Pulet greet their guests as they arrive at
the front gates When the elephant shows up they have him
go around back

EXT CHINESE FIREWORKS FACTORY

An oriental-looking building A statue of a red dragon hangs
over its entrance

INT FACTORY

Dressed as three skunks Rover Mercury and Benny roll
fireworks out of their boxes and into a brown sack

But when Benny goes to scratch himself one of the unlit
fireworks flies into the air Fortunately Rover catches it
just in time

ROVER
Careful Benny

BENNY
Sorry But this costume itches
(Sniffing himself)
And it smells bad too

MERCURY
You’re supposed to smell bad You’re a
SKUNK

BENNY
Oh yeah

ROVER
(Holding up one of the bottle
rockets )
Mercury are you sure this plan is going
to work

MERCURY
Trust me By the time we’re through
those cats won’t know what hit ‘em

INT JULIET’S BEDROOM

Doc dressed as a sexy cheetah and Juliet dressed as a
polar bear cub put some last minute touches on their
costumes

DOC
How do I look

JULIET
Terrific You’re going to
knock ‘em dead tonight Doc

DOC
Well the cheetah is the
fastest cat on earth
JULIET

Zip me up

Doc helps Juliet into her costume It is now impossible to
tell that she is a cat

EXT THE CAT-PULETS’ VILLA

The dogs hidden entirely under their skunk costumes follow
Mercury across the street to the party The Cat-Pulets
unaware of who they are greet them at the door

LADY CAT-PULET
My what clever costumes

BENNY
I’m smelly and I’m darn proud
of it

Mercury suddenly notices that Benny’s tail is beginning to
stick out He rushes to get Benny passed The Cat-Pulets

MERCURY
Come on big mouth

INT VILLA

The entire place is wall to wall with animals An orchestra
made up of penguins plays classical music Flyer dressed as
a peacock dances in mid-air with an eagle

When the dogs enter they make a bee-line for the buffet

BENNY
Get a load of this spread

MERCURY
Eat up boys In a few minutes this
party’s going to be history

MEANWHILE

Doc is surrounded by various animals who want to dance with
her

DOC
Please don’t fight I’m only one kitty

Juliet smiles at her friend’s good fortune But her smile
suddenly turns into a frown when she sees her parents and
VIENNA a snobby Viennese bachelor cat approaching

LADY CAT-PULET
Juliet you remember Vienna don’t you

JULIET
(Grimacing)
Of course

Vienna dressed as a unicorn smiles lasciviously

VIENNA
Juliet how purr-fect you look tonight

Vienna bends down to kiss Juliet’s paw but pokes her with his
horn Juliet screams

VIENNA
I’m soooo sorry I’m not used to being
mythological

Vienna laughs at his own lame joke Juliet’s had just about
enough of this drip

JULIET
Will you excuse me I think I see a
monkey I know by the buffet

ON THE DANCE FLOOR
The orchestra finishes its song The animals applaud

PENGUIN ORCHESTRA LEADER
The boys and I are going to take five for
a couple of ice cubes

Flyer’s dance partner smiles and gives him a peck on the
cheek as she flies off He sighs and looks at his peacock
feathers

FLYER
This is the one night each year when
nobody’s afraid of me
(Looking over at his dance
partner)
I sure wouldn’t mind another

AT THE BUFFET TABLE

The dogs are seriously digging in But as Rover reaches
across the table his black skunk paw accidentally bumps
into a white furry one He looks up and finds none other
than Juliet herself

Their eyes meet and it is LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT

ROVER
Wow
JULIET
You have the most amazing eyes
ROVER
So do you
JULIET

You can tell a lot about someone from
their eyes

ROVER

Oh yeah What do mine say
JULIET

That you’re honest
ROVER

Uh well usually

JULIET
And that you’re looking for something
Or maybe someone

Rover and Juliet stare at one another transfixed
Just then the orchestra starts up again

JULIET (contd)
Would you like to dance

Rover is tempted then looks over at Mercury and Benny
and remembers why he is here

ROVER
Oh I don’t know

JULIET
Come on It’s easy And besides when’s
the next time you’re going to see a polar
bear and a skunk dancing together

Rover smiles then gets pulled onto the dance floor by
Juliet A formal Renaissance-like dance begins Rover
looks around awkwardly uncertain what to do Trying to
mimic what the others are doing Rover steps right on
Juliet’s foot It’s all Juliet can do to keep from crying
out

ROVER
I’m sorry

JULIET
It’s all right Don’t worry about the
others

She turns his face to hers

JULIET (cont’d)
Look at me

Looking into those eyes a kind of miracle comes over Rover
He boldly twirls Juliet with precision

JULIET (cont’d)
That’s it

In no time Rover and Juliet are dazzling everyone at the
party with their dancing prowess The Cat-Pulets dancing
nearby can’t even begin to keep up with them

As the song ends the spectators applaud for Rover and
Juliet Rover leads her off the dance floor away from the
other Cat-Pulets

JULIET (cont’d)
Id say you’re a natural

ROVER
Id say you’re a great teacher

JULIET
Not that good

ROVER
In your arms anything seems possible

Rover looks at Juliet strangely
ROVER
Or should I say “in your paws” or “in
your wings”

She looks back at him furtively

JULIET
Are you trying to figure out what I am
ROVER
Maybe so
JULIET
That’s strictly against the rules you
know
ROVER

I like breaking rules

JULIET
Well these aren’t wings I’m no
chicken that’s for sure
ROVER
Are you a lamb

JULIET
No

ROVER
A rabbit

JULIET
Sorry

ROVER
A goat

JULIET

(Coyly)

Uh-huh

ROVER

Oh come on I just have to know

JULIET
Just have to huh What do you say
(An idea comes over her)
--- I show you instead

ROVER
Are you just going to take off your mask

JULIET
I will if you will

Rover gulps and looks around fearfully

ROVER
Here

JULIET
Why not

ROVER

How about we go to the garden instead
I’m kinda shy

JULIET
All right then I’11 meet you there in
five minutes
Juliet hurries off Rover almost swoons

ROVER
I’m in love

Mercury appears in a huff
MERCURY

What gives Rover We’re here to do some
damage not win a dance contest

Rover sees Juliet walk outside

ROVER
I know I know but I think the polar
bear is on to us I’m just trying to
keep her distracted

MERCURY
Well hurry it up Benny’s setting up the
pyrotechnics
even as we speak
EXT GARDEN

Under the starry night Juliet awaits her true love

sneaks up from behind and places his paws over her eyes

ROVER
Guess who

JULIET
The animal of my dreams

ROVER
Close enough

Rover walks around in front of Juliet

JULIET
Ready

Rover looks around one last time to make sure that the coast

is clear
ROVER
Let’s do it
JULIET
On the count of three
One
ROVER
Two
JULIETROVER
Three

Rover and Juliet lift their masks Both are shocked

JULIET
YOURE A DOG

ROVER
YOURE A CAT

JULIET
What are you doing at my family’s party
You must know we I mean they hate dogs
ROVER
You mean you don’t hate dogs too

JULIET
I can’t hate someone I don’t even know
That would be silly

ROVER
I guess you’re right

JULIET
So what are we going to do I mean it
seemed like we were sort of becoming I
don’t know friends

ROVER
Yeah it sure seemed that way But I just
don’t think the world’s ready for a cat
and a dog being friends

JULIET
Yeah I guess not

Both are terribly saddened by this realization

ROVER
Well see ya

Rover puts on his mask and starts back inside
JULIET

Hey I don’t even know
your name

ROVER
It’s Rover

JULIET
I’m Juliet

ROVER

(Gesturing to the balcony)
You mean like the girl

JULIET
That’s right

ROVER
Rover and Juliet I like that

JULIET
I like that too

ROVER
Though it does sound vaguely familiar

Juliet smiles slightly

ROVER (cont’d)
Well ‘Night Juliet

JULIET
Good night Rover

Rover leaves A single tear drop falls from Juliet’s eye
INT VILLA
Rover meets up with Mercury and Benny

MERCURY
Where have you been The fireworks are
just about to begin

ROVER
You know Merc’ I don’t think this is
such a good idea after all I mean
maybe The Cat-Pulets aren’t so bad

MERCURY
Are you nuts We’re finally going to
give these stuck up house-fluffers what
they deserve

Mercury jumps onto a chair

MERCURY (cont’d)
Listen up animals of Verona It’s time
for tonight’s entertainment courtesy of
the three muske-skunks Hit it Benny

Benny pushes down on a GIANT BOMB PLUNGER setting off the
fireworks and bottle rockets It is chaos as the animals
panic and try to flee In the confusion Rover finds Juliet
He pulls off his mask

ROVER
Juliet I’m sorry I tried to stop them
I really did

JULIET
I believe you Rover But you better
leave before my family gets their hands
on you

Rover and Juliet desperately want to kiss before parting but
can’t

As Rover flees the mayhem Tyger spots him

TYGER
I knew it The Mongrels

As Tyger starts to go after Rover Lord Cat-pulet stops him
LORD CAT-PULET
Wait Now’s not the time for revenge
Help calm our guests You’1ll get that
little doggie soon enough

EXT ABOVE VERONA

Flyer still in his peacock uniform is struggling to fly
home with all his long tail feathers

FLYER
Would you look at this How you supposed
to fly with tail feathers like this

When one of his elongated wings hits a tree branch Flyer
plummets to the earth

FLYER (cont’d)
And he falls with a tremendous splash in a bird bath He
ends up completely drenched

FLYER (cont’d)
It’s hard being beautiful

Dragging himself out of the bird bath Flyer finds he has
peacock feathers sticking out in every direction

Starting to pluck them out left and right he notices Rover

moping in the shadows by the cathedral

FLYER (cont’d)
Hey there Rover What’s the matter

ROVER
Oh Flyer it’s terrible
FLYER
What
ROVER
I’m in love At least I think I’m in
love
FLYER

But Rover that’s wonderful You’ve
wanted to be in love forever

ROVER
I know I know but

FLYER
But what

ROVER
it’s with a Cat-Pulet

FLYER
You mean Juliet
ROVER
Yes
FLYER
(Confused)
And that’s a problem
ROVER
Flyer She’s a cat
FLYER
So
ROVER

And I’m a dog
Flyer gives Rover a perplexed look

ROVER (cont’d)
Can’t you see I don’t think the world
is ready for a dog-cat relationship

FLYER
The world Rover since when have you
ever worried about what the world thinks
huh

Flyer looks at Rover but the dog lowers his eyes

FLYER (cont’d)
This is more about what you think isn’t

it
ROVER
I’m just so confused I don’t know if I
should I don’t even know if I could
Do you know any dog who would
FLYER

Love a cat

ROVER
Yeah

Rover shakes his head and walks away from Flyer dejected

FLYER
Rover

ROVER
What

Flyer finally has his entire costume off and flies over and
lands in front Rover
FLYER
Rover

ROVER
What

FLYER

Let me ask you something When you look
at me what do you see

ROVER
What do you mean what do I see I see
you Flyer

FLYER
And do you see that I’m a bat

ROVER
Of course I see that you’re a bat

FLYER
So then why aren’t you

Flyer bares his pathetically short fangs not looking even
remotely frightening

FLYER
afraid of me huh
ROVER
Why would I ever be afraid of you
FLYER
Because a lot of creatures think I’m
scary
ROVER
They do
FLYER
Oh yeah they don’t even like me being
around

Flyer takes a hop toward a couple of squirrels who
immediately scram in opposite directions

FLYER
See what I mean Without that peacock
costume I would never have gotten in to
the animal ball tonight

ROVER
But why are they afraid of you

FLYER
I don’t know Maybe

Flyer flies under a dark awning and hangs upside down

FLYER
- it’s because we like hanging upside
down in the dark

ROVER
What’s scary about that

FLYER
Beats me

Flyer comes back down to Rover now

FLYER
Maybe they think we carry germs or
something or we’re sneaky because we fly
so quiet Did you know that some
creatures even think we’re evil

ROVER
Evil

FLYER
Oh yeah Four hundred years from now
they’re going to be making all these
movies about bats who turn into vampires
and bite people’s necks and say

Flyer does his best Bela Lugosi

FLYER (cont’d)
“I vant to suck your blood”

ROVER
But that’s ridiculous You don’t want to
suck anybody’s blood You’re not a
vampire And you don’t carry germs
either You’re the cleanest most honest
creature in Verona How could anybody
think that you are scary

FLYER
I don’t know but somehow they do

ROVER
Well that’s crazy

Flyer touches Rover’s paw with his wing

FLYER
Rover it’s easy for you to see that it’s
crazy when it’s between bats and other
animals But can you see that it’s crazy
also when its between cats and dogs

Rover looks into the sky as if he’s been struck by
lightening
ROVER
My goodness you’re right It doesn’t
matter if we’re different What matters
is is

FLYER
What’s in your hearts

Rover looks back at Flyer

Rover sets of down the street at a full sprint

ROVER
Well I know what’s in mine

FLYER
I guess there’s only one thing left to
find out then isn’t there

ROVER
Yes absolutely Thank you Flyer
Thank you

watches him go happily

FLYER
‘Atta boy

INT JULIET’S BEDROOM

Flyer

Doc is helping Juliet slip out of her polar bear costume when
she begins to notice that Juliet seems very depressed about

something

But it is

Doc lifts

DOC
Are you all right Juliet You haven’t
said a word since the party

as if Juliet is in a dream

JULIET

I’m sorry What did you say Rover
DOC

Rover
JULIET

I’m sorry did I say Rover

DOC
Yes you did I’ve been called a lot of
things in my day but Rover isn’t one of
them Juliet

Juliet’s chin
DOC

Have you been rubbing whiskers with with
one of the canine persuasion

Juliet hides her eyes from Doc but she knows there’s no use
trying to hide the truth from her

JULIET
Yes I have I met him at the party We
talked We danced But in the end
(starting to cry)
Oh Rover Rover wherefore art thou
Rover

Doc takes a tissue from the vanity table and dries Juliet’s

eyes

JULIET
Oh Doc you won’t tell anyone will you

DOC
Of course not We love kittens got to
stick together Just don’t let Tyger
find out

At that moment A LONELY HOWL is heard outside the house
Juliet crosses to the window and looks down into the street

JULIET
It’s Rover

DOC
Rover

JULIET

Oh my goodness

DOC
Hey he’s kind of cute

JULIET
You think so

DOC
Well for a dog

JULIET
Oh Doc what am I going to do

DOC
Go out and talk to him

JULIET
Talk to him What do I say

DOC
Say “Hey ya big boy why don’t you come
up and see me some time”

JULIET
I can’t say that
DOC
Then just be yourself You’1l be fine

Juliet opens the window and slips out on the balcony

clears his throat and begins to speak

ROVER
But soft What light from over yonder
comes and breaks my window

JULIET
What
ROVER
That’s not right I mean what yonder
broke my light I mean my window
JULIET

Rover what are you saying

ROVER
I’m saying

He looks up at her suddenly full of confidence

ROVER

I’m saying that I love you
JULIET

What
ROVER

I love you Juliet And I want to know

if you love me too Because if you do

then all the differences between us will
mean nothing

JULIET
Oh Rover I do love you Very much

Rover

Rover suddenly flies into a series of back flips Juliet

laughs delightedly

JULIET
Come to me Rover

ROVER
Come to you

JULIET
Jump up here

ROVER
I can’t jump up there

JULIET
Why not

ROVER
Because I can’t jump that high I’ma
dog remember

JULIET
Oh So what do we do
ROVER
You’re going to have to come down here
JULIET
But I can’t do that
ROVER
Why not
JULIET
Because I’ve never been out of the house
before
ROVER

You’ve never seen Verona The most
beautiful town in the world

JULIET
No

ROVER
Then come with me Juliet and I will show
it to you and you will have the most
wonderful night of your life

Juliet looks at Doc questioningly

JULIET
Doc

DOC
Just don’t do anything I wouldn’t do

JULIET
But there isn’t anything you wouldn’t do

Doc smiles mischievously

DOC
Exactly

Taking one last look into her bedroom Juliet turns and
dashes off the balcony She leaps high into the air and
lands right beside Rover After looking dreamily into his
eyes Juliet finally shrugs shyly

JULIET
Verona remember
ROVER
Oh yes Verona And what would you

like to see first

JULIET
All of it I want to see all of it

And with that the happy couple darts off into the city paw
in paw Flyer who has been observing the young lovers from
a tree limb flaps behind them

EXT VERONA STREETS - NIGHT

A moment later Rover and Juliet are SWINGING AROUND LAMP
POSTS and DANCING IN THE STREETS Juliet is of course
fascinated by everything she sees but especially by the orbs
of light and the oranges and other round fruits she sees
through a market’s window

Overcome with chivalry Rover sneaks in the back door of the
market and returns a minute later with a couple of nectarines
that he’s pawned

ROVER
Where to next
JULIET
(Pointing to the fruit)
Throw it
ROVER
What
JULIET
Throw it

Rover FLINGS the nectarine down the street Juliet points in
the direction it has gone

JULIET (contd)
I want to go there

EXT VERONA STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Rover and Juliet have caught up with the rolling fruit

Laughing and giggling they kick it on further straight
down the sidewalk and into the opera house

Outside the front door Rover and Juliet dodge the legs of
people entering the opera house Slowly a DEVILISH GRIN
spreads across Juliet’s face and she bolts into the opera
house after the nectarine Rover is right behind her

INT OPERA HOUSE

The nectarine is being inadvertently kicked around the front
lobby Before Rover and Juliet can catch up to it though it
is kicked down a back hallway toward a dressing room

INT DRESSING ROOM

Rover and Juliet tear after the bouncing nectarine only to
become accidentally entangled in TWO ELABORATE COSTUMES

INT BACKSTAGE AT THE OPERA

The nectarine continues to roll just out of reach of Rover
and Juliet who have now come to be wearing the elaborate
costumes

INT THE OPERA HOUSE STAGE

Finally the nectarine comes to rest downstage center
A second later Rover and Juliet catch up to it there Then
the lights go down A HUSH falls over the audience

The CONDUCTOR taps his baton and clears his throat All eyes
fall on Rover and Juliet who look at one another

JULIET
What are we supposed to do now
ROVER
Sing I think
JULIET
Sing what
CONDUCTOR
(Whispering)

Your first line is “Figaro”

JULIET
Figaro

Suddenly the orchestra springs to life Beautiful music
fills the chamber But Rover and Juliet struggle to sing
operatically

ROVER
Figaro Figaro

JULIET
Figaro

Suddenly two underwear clad opera singers appear onstage and
begin chasing Rover and Juliet around

EXT BOTANICAL GARDEN - SECONDS LATER

Finally making it back outside the opera house Rover jumps
into a flowerbed and begins picking roses and daisies left
and right Soon he has made a gigantic bouquet which he
presents proudly to Juliet As Rover and Juliet come out of
the garden a delightful smell wafts by and tempts their
noses

EXT BAKERY
Following the smell down the street they come to “Domino’s

Bakery” Peering in the front window they see a young
APPRENTICE taking loaves of bread from the oven
44

INT BAKERY

Unable to resist the smell of the fresh-baked bread Rover
and Juliet sneak into the bakery and creep nearer and nearer
the bread

But then Rover accidentally swats a pepper shaker with his
tail making the Apprentice sneeze The just risen loaves of
bread fall as flat as pancakes The baker SENOR DOMINO
becomes incensed and swats the Apprentice with his hat

A chase around the bakery begins where the TOMATO and
MOZZARELLA which the baker was eating for supper end up
being spread on the FLATTENED LOAVES OF BREAD

Just as Senor Domino has the Apprentice cornered he smells
the PIE SHAPED CREATION on top of the stove

Suddenly he has an idea and cuts the pie into TRIANGULAR
PIECES After smelling one curiously he plops it in his
mouth

SENOR DOMINO
Hey that’s pretty good

As Senor Domino chomps down another bite the Apprentice
flattens out a bread box making the first pizza box

APPRENTICE
Wait a second I got it We’1ll deliver

SENOR DOMINO
We’1ll call it Domino’s

In their joy of their new discovery they don’t notice how
Rover creeps up to the stove and swipes the first pizza
inthe history of the world

On the way out the door Juliet snatches the Apprentice’s
bottle of milk too

EXT RIVER - MOMENTS LATER

Rover and Juliet are riding in a gondola down the river
eating the pizza and drinking the milk and being serenaded by
a quartet of string-playing crickets

ROVER
It would go great with a little
pepperoni wouldn’t you say

JULIET
I think I’d prefer anchovies

When they come to an arched bridge Rover takes Juliet’s paw
and they’re off again

ROVER
Come on

EXT VERONA STREETS - LATER

Rover and Juliet continue their happy romp through town
Soon they come to the Arena Rover runs right through the
front door

JULIET
What is this

ROVER
It’s the Arena

EXT INSIDE THE ARENA

Rover and Juliet scamper up to the emperor’s box and look at
the Roman ruins around them

ROVER
Can you imagine what it was like back
then

Suddenly magically the Arena is transformed into its
classical glory

TOGA-CLAD SPECTATORS are doing “the wave” GLADIATORS
prepare to fight EXOTIC BEASTS A wreathed sports announcer
looking an awful lot like Marv Albert does the play by play
In an instant a WOOLY MAMMOTH charges at a gladiator in the
center of the ring The gladiator is ROVER

Rover however is too enamored of Juliet and doesn’t notice
the tusked beast bearing down on him Juliet meows

Just in time Rover leaps to the side using a toga as a
matador uses a cape Within seconds Rover has brought the
beast to the ground and has wrapped its trunk around its
feet like a cowboy ropes a calf Juliet tosses roses to
Rover who picks them up with his teeth

EXT HILLS ABOVE VERONA - DAYBREAK

An instant later Rover and Juliet are dashing for the hills
It’s all Flyer can do to keep up with them

EXT TOP OF THE HILL - SUNRISE

Rover and Juliet sit side by side with all of Verona below
them The sun is just coming up They look deep into one
another’s eyes

Just as they begin to move closer to one another Flyer comes
to the top of the hill and is hit by direct sunlight This
knocks his RADAR all out of whack and he promptly crashes
into a CHICKEN COOP getting egg all over himself

Back on the top of the hill meanwhile all the other animals
(except dogs and cats of course) have gathered around to see
Rover and Juliet move CLOSER and CLOSER

When the young lovers kiss it is like all of Italy sighs

with them

Just seconds later Flyer gets to the scene

Rover and
When they
Then they
to spread

FLYER
Darn I missed the best part

Juliet look at him and then back at one another
kiss again Flyer literally shivers with happiness
turn paw in paw and watch the sunlight continue
over Verona

EXT STREET - EARLY MORNING

Verona still sleeps as Rover and Juliet return home from
their adventure When they reach The Cat-Pulets’ villa the

two young

longingly

lovers stop at its gates and look at each other

ROVER
Well Here we are
JULIET
(Sighing)
Home
ROVER

Last night was amazing

JULIET
I’1ll never forget it as long
as I live

ROVER
I won’t either

Juliet starts under the gate

JULIET
I just wish

ROVER
Yeah

JULIET

I just wish we could do this every night

ROVER
And every day too

JULIET
But if our families ever found out

ROVER
We’d never get to see each other again

The lovers tremble merely at the thought
JULIET
This feud is so dumb

I mean cats and

dogs aren’t so different

ROVER

We both walk on four legs

JULIET
We both have tails

ROVER
We both fall in love

JULIET
(Smiling)
Yeah We both do

ROVER

don’t we

You know maybe there is a way we can be
together and stop our two families from

fighting

JULIET
But how

ROVER
Come with me

EXT CATHEDRAL

To the cathedral

A glorious renaissance church in the heart of Verona THE
CAMERA TRACKS UP the facade of the cathedral right into its

bell tower

INT BELFRY

Flyer hangs upside down from the rafters reading ‘How to Win

Friends and Influence Animals’

FLYER

Rover and Juliet stand below

(Throwing down his book)

You want me to WHAT

ROVER

I want you to marry us

FLYER

Don’t you think you’re moving just a

little fast

ROVER

It’s the only way Flyer

Romeo told me

that he and the girl Juliet were going to

be married in the church

FLYER
They were
ceremony
affair

The Friar performed the
It was a small but lovely
ROVER
Romeo also said that getting married
would help end the feud between their two
families

FLYER
I gotta hand it to the boy
he’s sharp

Rover and Juliet look up at Flyer knowingly

FLYER (cont’d)
Oh I get it You think you two could
do the same for cats and dogs

The lovers smile and nod

FLYER (cont’d)
Maybe but I’m not a friar
I’m just a bat who lives in the belfry
That’s what bats do

ROVER
Please Flyer If it weren’t for you
Juliet and I wouldn’t even be together
All you have to do is say a few words
Nothing fancy

FLYER
I don’t know

Juliet notices the title of Flyer’s book and gets an idea

JULIET
Come on Rover Let’s go home He’s just
an old scary-looking bat

FLYER
Now wait a second young lady

JULIET
It’s not like he wants to help end the
feud between cats and dogs I mean then
everybody would like him Nobody would be
afraid of him anymore

Juliet’s reverse-psychology works Flyer swoops down from
the ceiling and stops them

FLYER
I guess I could say a few words I have
watched enough weddings in my day
Rover and Juliet smile

FLYER
Come Gather close

Flyer hovers in front of the couple

FLYER
Do you Rover take Juliet to be your
wife

ROVER
You bet I do

FLYER
And do you Juliet take Rover to be your
husband

JULIET
Yes I do

FLYER
Then by the power you have vested in me
I now pronounce you cat and dog You
may kiss the kitty

They kiss As if on cue the CHURCH BELLS begin to ring
EXT CATHEDRAL - MORNING

Rover and Juliet climb out the window and onto the street
Suddenly RICE begins to fall on their heads They both look
up and find Flyer clutching a bag

FLYER
What’s a wedding without rice

They smile and wave Rover notices the people on the street

ROVER
Wow I better get you home

JULIET
No Rover We better split up At least
until we tell our families the news

ROVER
Then we can be together whenever we want

JULIET
I can’t wait

ROVER
I’1l meet you back at your house with the
rest of The Mongrels I think we should
tell everyone together

JULIET
I agree Farewell Rover Parting is
such sweet sorrow

ROVER
Hey that’s kinda nice

They sneak a final kiss and Juliet dashes off Rover is left
with a huge smile on his face
EXT PIAZZA - MORNING
Once again the market place is bustling with people
INT UNDER THE WATCHMAKER’S KIOSK

Benny Mercury and Big Daddy wait impatiently Benny
snatches one of the watchmaker’s watches and checks the

BENNY
Where do you think Rover is

MERCURY
Don’t ask me But he was acting pretty
strange at the party last night

BIG DADDY
Speaking of The Cat-Pulet’s party I
heard what you boys did

BENNY
You should have seen it Big Daddy It
was great

BIG DADDY
No Benny it was stupid Now all of the
other animals probably hate us as much as
the cats do You pups need to pick your
fights more carefully

MERCURY
But Big Daddy those cats -

Big Daddy rises over Mercury

MERCURY

Sorry Big Daddy We’1ll be more careful
I promise

Rover finally arrives

BIG DADDY

ROVER

Big Daddy waits for an explanation

ROVER
Overslept

BENNY
(Whispering)
Good answer

BIG DADDY
Because of your failure to pull off the
butcher heist Rover The Mongrels went

time

BIG DADDY (contd)
hungry That’s not going to happen
again

(Looming over Rover)
Is it

ROVER
No Big Daddy

BIG DADDY
Today I’m sending you three on a mission
even the dumbest dogs could do
EXT BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE PIAZZA

Tyger and his henchcats watch as The Mongrels sneak across
the marketplace Tyger wears a gold WHISTLE around his neck

TYGER
Well if it isn’t our little friends the
skunks

SHAKE
Something is smelly in The State of
Denmark

TYGER

We’re in Verona you idiot

SPEARE
Et tu Ty-gre

Tyger WHACKS them both across the head

TYGER
SHUT UP I have a plan to insure every
mongrel in Verona thinks twice before
messing with The Cat-Pulets again

EXT BEHIND THE MEAT STAND
The dogs pick through the scraps Mercury finds a T-Bone

MERCURY
Look at this beauty

ROVER
I better find one too I need to be on
Big Daddy’s good side today

BENNY
What’s so special about today

ROVER
I have something important to tell the
family

MERCURY
Oh yeah So tell us

ROVER
Well
Rover decides if he wants to spill the beans

TYGER (0S)
Yes Tell us Rover

The dogs look up and find the cats right behind them

TYGER
Tell us all what’s so important
MERCURY
So I see you brought your goons this
time
SHAKE
Goons
SPEARE

He is a dog of most infinite jest

Tyger hisses at Shake and Speare Then he approaches
Mercury

TYGER
I have some unfinished business with you
Mongrels A little payback for crashing
our party

Rover gets between Tyger and Mercury

ROVER
Listen we’re all very sorry about what
we did Tyger

MERCURY
What are you doing Rover These
fluffballs don’t deserve an apology
They deserve a nice bite on the behind

ROVER
No Mercury Fighting isn’t the answer

MERCURY
Oh yeah Then what is

Everyone looks at Rover

ROVER
Love

The cats and dogs break out in hysterics

TYGER
This little doggie’s nuts

Benny steps forward and joins Rover

BENNY
Maybe Rovers right

MERCURY
Benny

BENNY

I don’t like fighting Merc’ It’s really
stupid And for me that’s saying a lot

TYGER
Looks like The Mongrels aren’t so tough
after all

Mercury sticks his face up to Tyger’s

MERCURY
Just try me Pussy
BENNY
Remember what Big Daddy said Merc’ We
have to choose our fights more carefully
ROVER
He’s right Merc’ Just take

the bone and walk away

TYGER
What’s it going to be Are you a dog
or a chicken

Mercury is ready to attack but surprisingly he steps back

MERCURY
You ain’t worth it Tyger

Mercury turns around and starts to walk away when suddenly
TYGER POUNCES ON HIM running his razor sharp claws down
Mercury’s back He draws blood

ROVER
Why you

The henchcats grab Rover and Benny Tyger has Mercury on his
back while he continues to claw him

Rover can’t stand to watch his friend being hurt With all
of his might he shoves the henchcats to the ground and jumps
on top of Tyger pulling him off of Mercury Rover gets
Tyger pinned down He opens his jaws ready to bite the
vicious cat

ROVER (cont’d)
I don’t want to have to bite you Tyger

TYGER
Believe me you’re not going
to get the chance

Tyger BLOWS on his gold whistle At first Rover doesn’t
understand why Then the sound of a horse approaching fast
is heard Rover looks up and sees

THE DOG CATCHER his silver net in the air Before Rover
can run away the net swoops down and scoops him up The Dog
Catcher holds Rover to his face

DOG CATCHER
Gotcha Mongrel I told you I would
Fortunately someone left me this
anonymous note

Rover sees the note Written sloppily it reads ‘IF YOU
WANT TO FIND THE MONGRELS IN THE PIAZZA JUST LISTEN FOR THE
WHISTLE’

Rover looks down at Tyger grinning He holds up his paws

It is covered in BLACK INK The gold whistle is still in his
mouth The Dog Catcher gallops off with Rover Benny and
Mercury can only watch helplessly as their friend is taken
away

INT DOG POUND

The place is jam-packed with stray dogs When The Dog Catcher
attempts to shove Rover into one of the already crowded
cages the frightened pup pops right out The Dog Catcher
grabs Rover by a tuft of fur and holds him up to his face

DOG CATCHER
Well it looks like it’s your lucky day
poochy No room at the pound

The Dog Catcher brings Rover close

DOG CATCHER (contd)
Now what shall I do with you hmm I
hear in some countries little doggies
are a delicacy

Rover shivers in terror

DOG CATCHER (contd)
No You’re too small to cook I have a
better idea

EXT ALLEY

The Mongrels gather around Mama Mongrel as she licks
Mercury’s wounds

BIG DADDY MONGREL
What the Cat-Pulets did today is an act
of war From this day forth let no
feline feel safe in Verona The Mongrels
are fighting back

INT VILLA

The Cat-Pulets gather in the living room Lady Cat-Pulet
licks Tyger’s wounds

LORD CAT-PULET
What the Mongrels did today is an act of
war From this day forth let no canine
feel safe in Verona

TYGER
Don’t worry father The Dog Catcher
took care of the Mongrel that attacked
me

JULIET
(Concerned)
What was the name of the dog

TYGER
Rover How cliché

Juliet is in shock She turns to Doc

JULIET
(Whispering)
I can’t believe Rover would do something
like that

LORD CAT-PULET
Our mortal enemy has always been the dog
And now you can see why It’s time The
Cat-Pulets fought back

The Cat-Pulets meow in agreement then follow Lord Cat-Pulet
out of the room As Juliet is leaving she overhears Tyger
and his henchcats

TYGER
It was pretty clever how I made it look
like Rover attacked me just as the dog
catcher came by

Tyger laughs devilishly Juliet now knows the truth
INT BEDROOM
Juliet runs in and grabs Doc
JULIET
Doc Tyger set Rover up My husband is
innocent Go to the pound and tell Rover
I know the truth and that I still love
him I just hope he’s all right
EXT GATES OF VERONA - NIGHT

The Dog Catcher rides just outside the city and drops Rover
on a dirt road

DOG CATCHER
Hit the road mutt You’re banished
And if I ever see your grubby little face
again you’ll be meat for my meatballs
NOW BEAT IT

Rover starts down the road The Dog Catcher rides back into
the city The gates slam shut behind him
Rover stops and turns around

ROVER
I’m not going anywhere without seeing
Juliet one last time

EXT JUST INSIDE CITY WALLS - HOURS LATER

A furious scratching is heard beneath the earth After a
moment Rover pokes his head out He’s burrowed his way under
the wall and comes out completely covered in mud He’s even
got dirt in his mouth

ROVER
Patooie Yeeech

He looks up at the high wall towering above him

ROVER (cont’d)
Man I need to learn to jump

Shaking himself off as best he can Rover starts off for the
Cat-Pulets’ but no sooner is he on the road than he sees a
BLACK HORSE APPROACHING AT A THUNDERING PACE

ROVER (cont’d)
Oh no The Dog-Catcher

Rover leaps from the road and buries himself in a pile of
leaves only to discover that the horse is being ridden by a
cute little boy Getting up cautiously Rover slinks from
lamp post to lamp post completely covered in leaves It
looks as though he’s been tarred and feathered

EXT STREETS OF VERONA - LATER

Nearing the piazza Rover turns a corner and heads down a
street leading to the Cat-Pulets’ Again we hear a horse
approaching This time it is the Dog Catcher but Rover has
hidden himself in the shadows

The Dog Catcher is more menacing than ever now wielding a
whip and striking at any animal in the street

DOG-CATCHER
Yee-ah Yee-ah

The Rats who are having supper in the alley are nearly
lashed by the whip After the Dog Catcher is gone they
return to their meal Rover listens in

FIRST RAT
Hey what’s up with Igor

SECOND RAT
Ah he’s mad about pulling a double
shift Ever since that dumb mutt started
the riot in the square

FIRST RAT
You mean Rover

SECOND RAT

That’s his name You should have heard
the Cat-Pulets cursing him when I was up
there stealing this cheese Every one of
them That mutt better not go anywhere
near that place let me tell you

(Gesturing to his plate)
Rougefort

FIRST RAT
Why thank you

Rover walks away from the rats dejected Finding a puddle of
water he looks at his reflection

ROVER
(To himself)
Every one of the Cat-Pulets Do you
think Juliet could hate me too

Rover looks up at the Cat-Pulets’ house and ponders for a
second Then he turns and runs down the street in the
opposite direction

EXT VERONA STREET - LATER
Doc is walking down the street muttering to herself

DOC
Can you imagine A cat on the way to the
pound Just think what this will do to
my reputation

When she turns the corner Doc sees Rover sprinting down the
street still partially covered in leaves

DOC
(To herself)
Rover Where you off to in such a
hurry

Doc looks down a hill and can see that Rover is heading
straight for the cathedral Sighing she sets off after him

DOC
From the pound to the church Talk about
out of your element

INT BELFRY

Flyer stands before a mirror combing his hair with dippity-do
hair gel

FLYER
Maybe if I part it on the side nobody
will think I’m so

Suddenly Rover enters the church window and leaps into the
belfry

ROVER
(Panting)
Flyer Where are you Flyer

Flyer hides his hair gel and tries to flatten down his hair

FLYER

I’m right here What’s wrong
ROVER

I’ve been vanished
FLYER

Vanished What do you mean
ROVER

Like from Verona
FLYER

Oh you mean “banished”
ROVER

Exactly
FLYER

Why
ROVER

Because I got in a fight with Tyger only
it wasn’t my fault but then the dog
catcher came and he thought it was my
fault but it wasn’t I swear I swear

FLYER
Rover you shouldn’t swear in church -

ROVER
And now all the Cat-pulets hate me even
Juliet What am I going to do Flyer
What am I ever going to do

Rover collapses in tears on the floor of the belfry Flyer
looks down on him with irritation

FLYER
Come on get up

ROVER
I can’t Can’t you see My life is
over Oh woe is me

Flyer decides to try a little reverse psychology

FLYER
Why you’re nothing but a hound dog
crying all the time

Rover looks up at Flyer slightly indignant

ROVER
A hound dog

FLYER
There’s always hope Rover No matter
how bleak things look You just got to
get up and keep trying

ROVER
But what hope can there be for me now

At that instant Doc appears at the window above Rover and
Flyer She postures herself like a nightclub performer from
the 1940s

DOC
Hey ya big boys Why you look so glum

ROVER
Doc

Rover leaps to his feet and rushes to the stairs below Doc
As he starts to scramble up Doc yells sharply

DOC
Rover stay where you are

Rover freezes and looks up at Doc confused

DOC
You’re ruining my big entrance

And with that Doc saunters down the steps with her tail
wrapped about her shoulders like a mink stole

DOC
I bring word from my lady

ROVER
What oh what tell me please Does she
hate me Does she never want to see me
again Tell me please I have to know

DOC
Tell me something do all dogs drool like
that

It’s all Rover can do to keep from ringing Doc’s neck

ROVER
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT JULIET

DOC

Ah quit your yelping She loves you
still

ROVER
(ecstatic)
She does

DOC
And she knows Tyger had you set up

ROVER
She does

DOC
And she wants to see you as soon she can

ROVER
She does

DOC
She does

Rover scrambles toward the open window

ROVER
Then I’m going now

DOC
Just a second

Rover pauses at the window

ROVER
What

DOC
You aren’t going to go looking like that
are you For a golden retriever you’re
looking a little tarnished

ROVER
Don’t you worry Doc Don’t you worry

Rover heads out of the belfry completely excited

EXT BENEATH JULIET THE GIRL’S BALCONY - NIGHT

Rover approaches the balcony thoroughly cleaned He seems to
be on top of the world until he remembers how high the

balcony is

Seeing no other choice he takes a few steps back and charges

toward the balcony A few feet from the wall he makes a
tremendous leap but only makes it about half way up and
crashes back down to the ground

ROVER
Now what am I going to do

Truly starting to become dejected Rover’s spirits change
when he sees ROMEO APPROACH CARRYING A LADDER

Romeo places the ladder against the balcony and begins to go
up but then thinks of something and goes back down Then he
begins to look for something in the garden

Rover takes advantage of the opportunity and scampers right
up the ladder He is just about to steal into Juliet’s
chamber when he turns and discovers Romeo picking flowers for
Juliet the Girl in the garden

Feeling like he needs to do the same for his Juliet Rover
goes back down the ladder Down in the garden Romeo sees
Rover

ROMEO
Oh loyal pooch Have you a fair maiden
of your own Perchance a beagle A
collie And must you stake your very
life just to set eyes upon her I think
not How much simpler it would be to be
a lowly dog

Romeo scratches Rover behind the ears and heads back to the
ladder with his bouquet Once Romeo has gotten off the top
Rover scrambles up behind him

Just as both Romeo and Rover are about to enter their
respective entrances on the balcony they are simultaneously
overcome with a teenager’s sense of insecurity

Completely unaware that the other is doing the same thing at
the same time both the dog and the boy look at their
reflections in the window and fix their hair

Then they flex their biceps and blow into their handpaw to
check for bad breath Finally convinced that all is in
order the lovers puff up their chests and make their
dashingly romantic entrances

INT JULIET THE GIRL’S BEDROOM

Both Juliet and Juliet the Girl are primping themselves as
the door to the balcony opens The male lovers swagger in
Juliet sees Rover Juliet the Girl sees Romeo

Both sets of lovers jump into each other’s arms

INT JULIET THE GIRL’S BEDROOM - DAYBREAK

Romeo and Juliet the Girl lay in one another’s arms on the
love seat Meanwhile underneath the bed Rover and Juliet
do exactly the same thing

After a moment we hear A BIRD CALL

ROVER AND JULIET’S POV

Romeo’s legs come off the bed and move to the window A
moment later we hear the CURTAINS TORN OPEN and the room
fills with light

UNDER THE BED

Rover looks at Juliet panicked at how late it’s gotten
Pecking her on the cheek he gets up to go Juliet grabs him
desperately just as

JULIET THE GIRL (0S)
Wilt thou be gone It is not yet day

Juliet squeezes Rover so tightly he begins to turn blue
It’s like she’s put a VICE around his neck

ROMEO (0S)
I must be gone and live

Finally he breaks through Juliet’s clutches and catapults
across the room knocking over an expensive lamp

ROMEO (0S)
or stay and die

ABOVE

Romeo and Juliet the Girl are so enamored of one another that
they haven’t noticed the lamp crash to the ground

BELOW

Juliet has pounced on Rover again He points out the window
desperately to the rising sun

ROMEO (0S)
‘Tis the morn Look love

Juliet shakes her head and closes her eyes childishly
refusing to acknowledge the morning

JULIET THE GIRL (0S)
Yond light is not day-light

Suddenly Juliet radically shifts tactics lifting up the
blanket and casting a FLIRTATIOUS LOOK Rover’s way

JULIET THE GIRL (0S)
Therefore stay yet - thou need’st not to
be gone

This is too much for Rover to resist and he dives under the
covers to be with Juliet

ROMEO (0S)
Let me be put to death Juliet wills it
so It is not day

Suddenly Juliet is FRANTIC to get Rover out of the bedroom
Only now Rover clings to Juliet

JULIET THE GIRL (0S)
It is it is - hie hence be gone away

She pushes Rover toward the window RIPPING up the bedsheets
KNOCKING over the vanity table and SMASHING the chest of
drawers

In addition the canopy from the bed has gotten caught on the

chandelier

Romeo and Juliet The Girl meanwhile still have ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA the room is being literally DEMOLISHED

JULIET THE GIRL (0S)
--- O now be gone more light and light
it grows

The Nurse and Doc enter simultaneously Doc stares at the
destruction around her

NURSE (0S)
Your lady mother is coming to your
chamber The day is broke

DOC
(to herself)
So’s the lamp

NURSE (0S)
Be wary Look about

The chandelier crashes to the ground narrowly missing
all of the lovers who are STILL oblivious to the room being
destroyed They can only look deeply into one another’s
eyes

Finally dramatically Juliet the Girl opens the window

JULIET THE GIRL
Then window let day in and let life

out

ROMEO
Farewell farewell One kiss and I’1l
descend

Both pairs of lovers kiss simultaneously Then Rover and
Romeo head out the window and disappear into the street
Juliet and Juliet the Girl watch them go sadly Finally
Juliet the Girl notices that Juliet is there

JULIET THE GIRL
Oh Kitty Juliet alack the day Have you
a dashing prince far hence Some Siamese
cat Some Noble Persian It must be so
much simpler to be a cat

Both crying now Juliet and Juliet the girl comfort one
another

EXT FARM IN MANTUA - ONE WEEK LATER

Rover has breakfast with the pigs at their trough

ROVER
I don’t know how you fellas eat this
slop

PIG

You get used to it

ROVER
Those scraps in the piazza are looking
pretty good now Sure wish I was back
home
(Sighs)
--- with Juliet

The pigs look at Rover sympathetically for a moment then
return to their slop

INT BARN

Rover walks inside and finds the barn empty Confused he
BARKS

ROVER
Romeo Where are ya Romeo

Rover then finds Romeo’s red feathered cap His human friend
is gone

INT JULIET’S ROOM

Juliet curls up by the window looking out at the falling
rain She is still quite sad Doc saunters in

DOC
Are you planing on being miserable
forever

JULIET

I miss him Doc I miss him more and
more each day And to make matters
worse Juliet’s gone too I haven’t seen
her for days

DOC
You know how humans get when they’re in
love They can’t think about anything
else

JULIET
I’m starting to understand why

DOC
You gotta snap out of this kid Your
folks are real worried about you I
heard they’re even going to

JULIET
They’re going to what Doc

DOC
They’re going to ask

Just then Lord and Lady Cat-Pulet enter followed by Vienna
the snobby Viennese cat from the party

DOC
Vienna to marry you

Vienna bows before Juliet and kisses her paw

VIENNA
Juliet how purr-fect you look

Alarmed Juliet looks at Doc

JULIET
Oh no

EXT FARM IN MANTUA - NIGHT
Rover lies alone in the fields and HOWLS at the moon
ROVER
First I lose my girl then I lose my best
friend Could things get any worse

As if one cue it begins to rain Rover is soaked

ROVER
They could

He bows his head and begins to cry

FEMALE VOICE
Are you okay

Rover looks up and finds an adorable FEMALE GOLDEN RETRIEVER
PUPPY standing by the farmer’s house

ROVER
Well to be honest not really

FEMALE PUPPY
Why don’t you come inside The farmer
just put out some food

Rover’s tempted but not sure
FEMALE PUPPY
(Smiling)
Come on I won’t bite

Rover walks out of the fields and follows the cute puppy
inside

INT BELFRY

Flyer is experimenting with different breath sprays when
Juliet leaps into the the belfry

JULIET
Flyer
FLYER
What
JULIET
Youre never going to believe what’s
happened
FLYER
What
JULIET
My parents want me to get married with
Vienna
FLYER

Well did you try to talk them out of it

JULIET
Of course I did But they wouldn’t hear
it I can’t stand it how they treat me
like I’m some kind of kitten Flyer
what am I going to do

FLYER
I don’t know

Flyer thinks for a moment Then he shrugs his shoulders
FLYER
Well when in doubt
Flyer flies down to the sanctuary below Juliet leaps down

after him

JULIET
When in doubt what

Flyer comes across a vial which contains a potion and sits
on the Friar’s lectern

FLYER
When in doubt do what people do

JULIET
Do what people do What did they do

FLYER
Well believe it or not this same
situation is happening between Romeo and
Juliet

JULIET
No

FLYER
Can you imagine What are the chances
And so when your Juliet came here just a
little while ago Friar Laurence gave her
a potion like this which will make it
seem like she has died -

JULIET
Died

FLYER
Don’t be afraid It will only seem that
she has died Really

Flyer picks up a piece of chalk and begins scrawling on a
piece of slate like a coach diagramming a play

FLYER
She’ll just be sleeping So then she
won’t have to marry Paris Because then
her parents will think she’s dead see
And who’d want to marry a dead person
anyway right Is this making any sense

JULIET
I’m not sure

FLYER
Well let me see if I got this straight
What’s really going to be happening is
that Juliet’s just going to be sleeping

The chalk figures that Flyer has drawn come to life and try
to act out the elaborate plan But they become as confused
as Juliet is becoming

FLYER
--- and in forty two hours she’1ll wake up
good as new and then Romeo will be there

JULIET
How

CHALK FIGURES
Yeah how

FLYER
I don’t know how Somehow all right
And they’1l go run off together and make
a new life together in Mantua or
somewhere You got it

The Chalk Figures shake their heads vehemently Juliet turns
to Flyer tentatively

JULIET
And you’re saying this same plan would
work for me and Rover

FLYER
That’s exactly what I’m saying

JULIET
I don’t know

FLYER
What do you mean you don’t know

JULIET
Well it’s just it sounds so
dangerous And so complicated It just
seems like there’s a lot of things that
could go wrong

FLYER
Like what

JULIET
I don’t know It just doesn’t sound wise

FLYER
But Friar Laurence said -
JULIET
Well who cares what Friar Laurence said -
FLYER
I do
JULIET
Why
FLYER

Because he’s human that’s why And

everybody knows that humans are smarter

than animals And if they’ve made this

plan well it must be better than any
(MORE )

FLYER (contd)
plan we could come up with Don’t you
think

JULIET
I guess so

Neither one of them seem too convinced of the wisdom of their
plan but Flyer puts the potion in front of Juliet anyway

FLYER
Now take this vial and get yourself back
to your house and do exactly as I have
said You hear

Flyer opens his wings and starts flying toward the open
window

FLYER (cont’d)
I will fly now to Mantua to tell Rover of
our plan

Juliet looks at the vial on the lectern Finally she picks
it up and turns to go The Chalk Figures shake their heads
in disapproval

CHALK FIGURES
Youll be sorry

EXT SKY - NIGHT

Flyer flaps along panting rapidly The two Doves fly nearby
almost mocking how slowly the little bat struggles through
the air

FLYER
I wish I was a bird
(Almost completely out of
breath)
I wish I was a bird

Suddenly Flyer sees something below that literally stops him
in mid-air

FLYER (cont’d)
Oh no

As Flyer zooms down to the ground he becomes even more
upset

FLYER (cont’d)
No Say it isn’t so

Flyer lands finally on the steps of a large marble structure
called “The Monument of the Lovers” There beside him lay
the MOTIONLESS BODIES OF ROMEO AND JULIET THE GIRL They
embrace each other gently and seem almost to be sleeping
But the vial that lies beside Romeo’s outstretched hand and
the knife beside Juliet the Girl let Flyer know that these
lovers will never wake up again

The Doves look down on the scene from above

FLYER (cont’d)

Did Romeo find Juliet sleeping and think
- And so then he took this poison
--- And she waking up to find him
dead did she take the knife and

Flyer cries out loud

FLYER (cont’d)
Oh how did this happen How can this be

Flyer covers his head with his wings and sobs The Doves
look on from above For the first time they begin to realize
that Flyer is more than just a scary little bat Just as
they start to come closer a terrible realization spreads
across Flyer’s face

FLYER (cont’d)
But wait If this happened to Romeo and
Juliet then the same thing could happen
to

He turns and looks back toward Verona

FLYER (cont’d)
I’ve got to get back to Juliet and tell
her not to take that potion

Setting off toward Verona Flyer comes over a hill and is hit
by sunlight Once again his radar malfunctions and he spins
out of control to the ground

FLYER (cont’d)
Oh how can it get any worse than this

The Doves look at one another truly worried
INT JULIET THE GIRL’S BEDROOM

Juliet sits on Juliet the Girl’s bed considering Flyer’s
POTION The Chalk Figures hover nearby

CHALK FIGURES
Don’t do it You know it doesn’t make
sense -

But she starts to drink it anyway As she tips the vial
higher she sees herself in the mirror Suddenly she stops
drinking and looks herself in the eye

JULIET
Juliet what are you doing Of course
this doesn’t make sense

But the potion starts to take effect Just as she falls
unconscious she sets the vials on the floor

We see now she has only drank HALF OF THE POTION
EXT NEAR THE MONUMENT OF THE LOVERS

Flyer is trying to do anything he can to see in the light so
he can fly off to Verona again He even tries flying with a
seeing-eye-stick only to come crashing down to the earth
He ends up wrapped in thick vines nearly unable to move at
all

FLYER
Oh it’s no good I’11l never be able to
see in the light

Flyer’s head droops as he realizes there’s no hope

But not too far away the Doves look down touched by Flyer’s
determination to help Rover and Juliet Finally they muster
the courage to fly down to him A moment later they have
begun to peel away the vines

FLYER (cont’d)
Hey Hey What are you doing Get away
from me

DOVES
Shhh

Squinting to make out who it is Flyer begins to understand

FLYER
What Are you here to help me

The Doves nod

FLYER (cont’d)
Me Scary Flyer

His answer is to be lifted gently into the air The Doves
one on each of Flyer’s wing take him higher and higher and
head off toward Verona

INT JULIET THE GIRL’S BEDROOM

Lady and Lord Cat-pulet and Doc come into the room Doc is
carrying a beautiful white wedding dress Juliet lies
motionless on Juliet The Girl’s pillow

DOC
Juliet Look darlin’ Look what I made
of the sheets you tore up
(Observing her more closely)
Juliet

LADY CAT-PULET
Juliet wake up

LORD CAT-PULET
What’s wrong with her

DOC
I don’t know

LADY CAT-PULET
Is she Is she

As Lady Cat-Pulet looks closer and closer at her daughter
she begins to realize that something is truly wrong

EXT JULIET’S BALCONY - LATER

Doc lies on the stone wall weeping The rats on their way
out of the sewer feel her tear drops land on their tiny
heads They look up

FIRST RAT
What’s with the waterworks Doc

DOC
(Sobbing)
My best friend is dead

RATS
Juliet

Doc sobs and nods ‘yes’

FIRST RAT
That’s terrible

SECOND RAT
She was so young

FIRST RAT
So beautiful

SECOND RAT
And that’s saying a lot
coming from a couple of rats

FIRST RAT
Is there anything we can do

DOC
You can tell all the animals Tell them
Juliet will be buried in the cat-a-combs
at sunset

RATS
We won’t let you down Doc

INT VILLAS - MONTAGE

The rats climb through holes in the walls of villas
throughout Verona to tell domestic animals the news

EXT PIAZZA - MONTAGE

The rats scurry through the square to tell all of the city’s
stray animals the news

EXT ZOO - MONTAGE

The rats go from cage to cage The elephant uses his trunk
to wipe the tears from his eyes

EXT CATHEDRAL - END OF MONTAGE
The rats peer through a window in the bell tower but Flyer
is gone Instead the rats tell the pigeons perched atop the
cathedral
The pigeons saddened fly off
FIRST RAT
Now all of Italy will know of Juliet’s
passing

EXT FARMHOUSE IN MANTUA - MORNING

As Rover tries to leave the farmer’s house he is surrounded
by A LARGE FAMILY of golden retrievers

FEMALE PUPPY
My family really likes you Rover

The dogs lick and jump all over him

ROVER
You think

The Female Puppy snuggles up to Rover

FEMALE PUPPY
They think we make a great couple

ROVER
(Surprised)
A couple All we did was share a can of
Alpo

Just then the pigs saunter by on their way to the trough

FIRST PIG

Such a pretty cat gone before her time
SECOND PIG

It’s rumored she died of a broken heart
FIRST PIG

Seems to be happening a lot in Verona

these days

Rover’s curiosity is piqued

ROVER
Excuse me Pigs Who are you talking
about
SECOND PIG
Haven’t you heard Juliet Cat-Pulet is
dead
ROVER
(Shocked)
What
FIRST PIG
Did you know her
ROVER

Know her She was my wife

PIGS and DOGS
Your WIFE

ROVER
Which way back to Verona

The pigs point

ROVER
Farewell farm animals I must see my
sweet Juliet one last time

Rover runs down the dirt road The female puppy turns to her
mother

FEMALE PUPPY
Why are all the cute dogs married

EXT ABOVE FOREST OUTSIDE VERONA - AFTERNOON

As the Doves and Flyer approach the city walls the Doves see
the Pigeons from the cathedral flying sadly back toward town
They decide to fly up to them to find out what’s wrong

EXT CATACOMBS - LATE AFTERNOON

Rover runs up to the entrance to the catacombs completely
out of breath Because all his thoughts are on finding
Juliet as quickly as possible he doesn’t notice that Shake
and Speare are keeping watch from across the street

SHAKE
Zounds Forsooth wasn’t that the
scoundrel Rover

SPEARE
Perhaps we should exeunt stage left

SHAKE
To Lord Tyger’s

SPEARE
Exactamundo

As Rover enters the catacombs Shake and Speare laugh
menacingly and head out to find Tyger

INT CATACOMBS

The catacombs are a dark and somber place The tunnels go
lower and lower lit by spooky torches Frightening
tombstones and artifacts fill the entire place Rover looks
around unsure which way to go

EXT STREETS OF VERONA

Mercury and Benny are moping beside the river when a huge
mass of angry cats led by Shake and Speare and Tyger run
over the bridge near them Mercury swats Benny with his
tail

MERCURY

Come on
BENNY

What do you think they’re up to
MERCURY

I don’t know But it can’t be anything

good

Mercury and Benny head after the cat whistling to other
strays to come with them

INT CATACOMBS

Rover is deeper in the catacombs choosing between two
different passageways It’s even spookier down here It
seems like a ghost could pop out at any moment

ROVER
Juliet Oh Juliet where are you

EXT HILLS ABOVE CATACOMBS

Mercury and Benny look down at the entrance to the catacombs
amid a crowd of angry dogs A second later the angry cats
storm in the front door Mercury and Benny look at one
another confused

INT DEEP IN CATACOMBS

Just as Rover has reached the point of total frustration he
turns a corner and sees a newly decorated tomb with the words
“Juliet Cat-Pulet” written above it

MEANWHILE UPSTAIRS

The cats have gathered for a pep-talk

TYGER
Guys

The cats stand in line shoulder to shoulder Tyger
addresses them like an all-star wrestler He is so angry his
veins bulge out of his neck

TYGER
We’re gonna crush him Then we’re gonna
mush him And then we’re gonna flush
him
A confused cat turns to another cat

CONFUSED CAT
Who

TYGER
The pooch you moron

SHAKE
The pooch

SPEARE
The pooch

TYGER
My kingdom for that pooch

Shake turns to Speare

SHAKE
He’s kind of getting the hang of this

ALL THE CATS
Charge

The cats scatter throughout the catacombs in a mad frenzy
EXT CATACOMBS - SUNSET

The Doves finally get Flyer to the front door setting him
gently on the front step

FLYER
So she’s in here

The Doves nod pensively Flyer opens the front door and
looks in to the spooky catacombs

FLYER
Oooh Dark Spooky Reminds me of
home
(To the Doves)
Care to join me

The Doves shake their heads and high-tail it

INT JULIET’S TOMB

Rover solemnly approaches the tomb and finds Juliet laid out
on a golden pedestal She looks lovely Big tears come to
Rover’s eyes

ROVER
Oh Juliet Look at you There isn’t
anything I wouldn’t give just to hear you
purr once again

He kisses Juliet lightly on the cheek Suddenly Juliet
begins to purr ever so softly Rover looks at her completely
shocked
ROVER
Juliet Is that you Why why you’re
purring Your whiskers are moving
Juliet opens her eyes

ROVER
Juliet you are alive

JULIET
Of course I am alive

They hug each other ecstatically Then Rover looks at her
again unable to believe that his dream has come true

ROVER
But but I don’t understand

A wave of recognition spreads across Rover’s face

ROVER

Maybe it’s true what they say about cats
JULIET

What
ROVER

That you have nine lives

JULIET
I only have one life Rover But I want
to spend that life with you

ROVER
Then how did you

JULIET
I couldn’t do it I just couldn’t drink
all of that

At that very moment Tyger’s platoon turns the corner and
sees Rover Juliet still back in her tomb is not visible
to the charging cats

TYGER
There he is

As the cats near Rover turns to Juliet

ROVER
Come on

Juliet tries to get up but stumbles Obviously the potion
has not completely worn off yet

JULIET
I can’t yet Run

Rover looks at her longingly again

JULIET (cont’d)
Rover GO

Rover finally turns and sprints further down the passageway
The cats are right behind him Juliet tries to get their
attention

JULIET (cont’d)
Tyger guys Stop

- but Tyger is too focused on the chase and Juliet is too
weak The pursuit leaves her behind

IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

Flyer is soliciting help from some of his brethren who hang
upside down in a passageway

FLYER
Hey Lenny How’s it hanging

LENNY
Not so bad

FLYER
You know where Juliet’s tomb is

Lenny gestures with his eyes

LENNY
Thataway

FLYER
Thanks

MEANWHILE

Rover is losing ground The snarling pack of cats nip at his
heals as he ducks down yet another tunnel

NEAR THE TOMB

Flyer comes across Juliet who is now able to walk

FLYER

Juliet
JULIET

Oh Flyer you gotta help me
FLYER

What
JULIET

They’re trying to kill Rover
FLYER

Who
JULIET

My family They went down there

FLYER
Come on

AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL

Rover comes to a dead end He’s trapped The cats corner
him against the wall Tyger comes to the front of the pack

TYGER
Well done henchcats

Tyger practices elongating his nails as he did into the dart
board before

TYGER
Now we’re going to have a little fun

Rover looks at Tyger’s nails and is terrified
JUST DOWN THE TUNNEL A LITTLE LATER

Juliet and Flyer have found Rover and the pack They huddle
in the shadows and come up with a plan

FLYER
You got it

JULIET
I think so

FLYER
You’re not going to get scared

JULIET
Ill try

FLYER
All right then Let’s go

At the end of the tunnel the cats have Rover’s four limbs
pinned to the wall A bulls-eye has been drawn on Rover’s
chest Tyger stands behind a line drawn in the dirt and
prepares to throw All of a sudden we hear a terrifying
screech

All the cats turn and see Flyer who has converted himself
into a HORRIFYING VAMPIRE BAT He bares his fangs and dives
in on the cats They scatter in a flash

FLYER (cont’d)
I vant to suck your blood

Tyger is the only cat who can keep his cool

TYGER
Guys don’t panic Bats don’t suck
blood They don’t

FLYER
I live with ghosts I bring the dead
back to life

Flyer now points over to Juliet who walks into the group of
cats like a zombie and moans like a ghost

JULIET
Tyyyy-gerrrr Tyyyy-gerrrr

This is too much for even the toughest cat Tyger and the
whole crew run for their lives

JULIET
Oh Flyer you did it

Flyer reverts to his adorable self

FLYER
Aw shucks

JULIET
You see how much better plans work out if
you make them yourself

She frees Rover and hugs him
ROVER
I thought you said all that vampire stuff
was untrue
FLYER

Well so I fibbed a little Come on
lets get out of here

AT JULIET’S TOMB

Tyger discovers that Juliet is not there A suspicious look
comes over his face He heads upstairs at a quicker pace

EXT OUTSIDE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Rover opens a manhole and lets Juliet out Just when the
lovers think they’re home free now the dogs are after
them Mercury and Benny and their hoodlums surround Juliet

MERCURY
Hey we got ourselves a Cat-Pulet
(To Juliet)
Don’t you know it’s not safe to be out
alone

But Rover comes out of the manhole now and steps between his
friends and Juliet

ROVER
Mercury don’t hurt her

MERCURY
But she’s a cat

ROVER
It doesn’t matter if she’s a cat This
fight between our species has gone on
long enough

MERCURY
Why you sound like like a cat lover

Rover looks at Juliet

ROVER
Perhaps I am

MERCURY
Then in my book you’re as good as a cat

ROVER
(Hurt)
Mercury

BENNY
(Turning to Mercury)
Good as a cat What are you saying

MERCURY
I’m saying get them

All the dogs but Benny pounce after Rover and Juliet but the
young lovers make a few elusive maneuvers and dash down the
street Benny trails behind the pack almost hoping for
Rover and Juliet

A moment later Flyer comes out of the manhole only to
discover that another chase is happening

FLYER
Oh now come on Isn’t this getting just
a little bit ridiculous

But he flaps his way down the street to do what he can
EXT A FEW BLOCKS AWAY
Rover and Juliet are running down a narrow street which

turns into a dead end Juliet of course leaps to a balcony
and then to a roof top Rover is left below in the street

And the dogs are closing in
JULIET
Come on Rover Jump
ROVER
I can’t It’s too high
JULIET
No it’s not Just just believe

you are a cat

ROVER
Believe I am a cat

JULIET
That’s all youll need Trust me

Rover backs away from the wall to take a running start
Mercury and his thugs are closing in

ROVER
Believe I am a cat Believe I am a cat

Rover starts running toward the wall

JULIET
Hurry Rover

ROVER
Meow meow meow

Taking off just a few feet from the wall Rover jumps high
into the air just as the dogs swipe at him and miss

ROVER
MEEEEEEEEOWWWWWWWW

And he soars almost magically through the air landing on the
rooftop next to Juliet

JULIET
You did it

ROVER
I did

JULIET
You did

The dogs bark below In an instant Flyer has caught up to
them

FLYER
Come on you guys We’re not out of the
woods yet

In fact the woods have gotten even thicker Rover’s heroic
leap to the rooftop has caught the eye of TYGER AND HIS GOONS
who were heading back to the Cat-Pulet house

EXT STREETS OF VERONA

Now all the cats and all the dogs are chasing Rover and
Juliet through town As the commotion passes the Cat-Pulet’s
house and the Mongrel’s alley Rover and Juliet’s parents
join the chase

Pretty soon it seems like every animal in town is running
after Rover and Juliet They storm through markets houses
gardens restaurants churches You name it All of
Verona is being turned upside down

EXT ARCHED BRIDGE

Finally as Rover and Juliet run out onto the bridge the
CATS come up from one side and the DOGS from the other
Rover and Juliet are trapped

Flyer tries to get to them put a dog swishes his tail
knocking Flyer headfirst into the muddy riverbank

A complete circle has been made around the lovers now They
know they have nowhere to go After a moment Lady and Lord
Cat-Pulet and Big Daddy and Mama Mongrel come to the front
They all stare at their children with disapproval

ROVER
(To his parents)
Don’t hurt her

JULIET
(To her parents)
Don’t hurt him

LORD CAT-PULET
What’s going on here

BIG DADDY MONGREL
Yeah What is going on here

ROVER
Well the truth is

Rover turns to Lady Cat-Pulet

ROVER
Mom
LADY CAT-PULET
Mom
ROVER
(To Lord Cat-Pulet)
Dad
LORD CAT-PULET
Dad

(To Juliet)
Juliet what is the meaning of this

BIG DADDY MONGREL
(Folding his paws)
I’d really like to know myself

JULIET
The truth is
(Gulping)
- we’re married

ALL THE PARENTS

The TWO MOTHERS instantly faint to the ground All the dogs
and cats square off with one another A fight could break
out at any second

The TWO FATHERS look at one another accusingly

LORD CAT-PULET
This is all your fault Mongrel

BIG DADDY MONGREL
Well maybe if you knew how to lock up
your daughter

Rover and Juliet restrain their fathers

JULIET
Stop Please

ROVER
Can’t you see that this fighting between
us dogs and cats is ridiculous

JULIET
All you have to do is just open your
eyes

Lady Cat-Pulet and Mama Mongrel who have fallen side by
side regain consciousness and look one another in the eye

JULIET (cont’d)
and look at each other

Lord Cat-Pulet and Big Daddy Mongrel turn and look at one
another too In fact every dog on the bridge turns and
looks at the cat he or she was about to fight with

JULIET (cont’d)
you would see

The tension on the bridge begins to ease All the dogs and
cats reach out to one another much like a person looking at
himself in the mirror

JULIET (contd)
We’re really very much alike

Doc and Benny gaze at one another So do the mothers

JULIET (cont’d)
Much more alike than we are different

Unfortunately Tyger and Mercury aren’t so enchanted by the
sudden inter-species love-fest They look at one another
distrustfully As their paws come out to touch

Tyger elongates his nails right into Mercury’s eyes

TYGER
Bulls-eye

Mercury reels back in pain A dark look of fury spreads
across his face

TYGER (cont’d)
Or should I say “Dogs-eye”

Benny sees that Mercury’s getting COMPLETELY STEAMED

BENNY
Mercury no

But it’s too late Mercury jumps on Tyger starting a full
out brawl Dogs and cats are jumping in from everywhere now

Rover and Juliet try to get things calmed down again
JULIET
Guys stop
ROVER

Don’t please

But it’s no use SCREECHES and GROWLS are heard coming from
every direction Dog and cat limbs emerge from a growing
puff of smoke

Juliet ends up getting knocked down and nearly trampled
Rover runs to her

ROVER (cont’d)
Juliet

JULIET
Oh Rover

They look around themselves Their worst nightmare has come
to pass They hold each other on the verge of tears

Flyer meanwhile has finally extracted himself from the mud
He flies up to the bridge acompletely unrecognizable blob
Looking down on the battle below Flyer summons an almost
supernatural strength and bellows out an enormous yell

FLYER
STOP
All the animals turn and look When Flyer finally shakes the
mud off himself and the animals see that he is a bat they
recoil in shocked fear

FLYER (cont’d)
No Don’t be afraid of me Listen to
me

But they don’t seem to want to listen A few animals bolt
into the woods

FLYER (cont’d)
I’m not scary I’m not

Suddenly from above we hear a loud whistle A second later
the two Doves flutter down and put their wings around Flyer
just as he had tried to put his wings around them earlier
The other animals of Verona take this as a sign and begin to
grow less frightened of Flyer

FLYER (cont’d)
We shouldn’t be so distrustful of each
other We shouldn’t be afraid of each
other for no reason Dogs cats
any of us You see what can happen

Flyer turns and points toward town

Romeo and Juliet’s funeral procession is making its way
through the streets of Verona

All the Montagues and Capulets march behind a veiled hearse
As the procession makes its way across the bridge the
animals part somberly and let it pass

FLYER (cont’d)
Is that what we want to happen to us
too

Lord Cat-pulet and Big Daddy Mongrel look at one another for
a moment Then they turn and begin following the procession
All the other animals of Verona trail behind them as well
EXT HILL OVERLOOKING VERONA

The funeral procession comes to a halt at the top of the
hill The entire city of Verona can be seen below

As the cats and dogs follow Flyer the procession of mourners
begins to part to each side allowing Rover and Juliet to see
for the first time THE GRAVES OF ROMEO AND JULIET ‘Two
tombstones bear the lovers’ names

ROVER
Romeo

JULIET
Juliet

The Capulets and The Montagues lay red roses on each grave
The families turn and look at one another

LORD CAPULET
O brother Montague give me thy hand

Lord Montague and Lord Capulet take each other’s hand while
their wives weep in each other’s arms The Prince addresses
both families

PRINCE
Never was a story of more woe than that
of Juliet and her Romeo

The Prince and The Friar lead the two families back down the
hill Once enemies The Capulets and The Montagues are now
joined in their sorrow

When the humans are gone the dogs and cats approach the
graves encircling Rover and Juliet Flyer hovers above the
couple

FLYER
Cat-Pulets Mongrels Don’t make the
same mistakes that the families of Romeo
and Juliet made

Flyer hovers between the cats and dogs

FLYER
This war between cats and dogs what good
is it Can anyone even remember how it
began

The cats and dogs scratch their heads

FLYER
The time for peace has come You’re one
family now Brought together by the love
of Rover for Juliet and Juliet for
Rover What possibly could be
a better reason to forget your
differences than that

Flyer nudges Rover with his wing

FLYER
Rover
(Whispering)
Go make nice with your in-laws

Rover walks over to Lord Cat-Pulet

ROVER
Lord Cat-Pulet I love your daughter very
much and promise to always be good to
her

Lord Cat-Pulet looks at his wife then back at Rover

LORD CAT-PULET
I never thought I’d be saying this to a
mongrel but Welcome to the family
son

Lord Cat-Pulet and Rover embrace The cats meow and the dogs
bark with joy

BIG DADDY
(To Juliet)
Come give your big daddy a hug

Juliet gets a giant hug from Big Daddy Everyone is happy
except for Tyger and Mercury Flyer notices this and nudges
them together

FLYER
Boys don’t you have something you can
say to each other I mean you are
brothers now

Tyger and Mercury try to think of something

TYGER
Like milk

MERCURY
Gives me gas Bones

TYGER
Not a chance

FLYER
Well this may take a while

Big Daddy and Lord Cat-Pulet have their paws around each
other’s shoulders

BIG DADDY
Come Let’s return to Verona Together

The cats and dogs begin to walk down the hill Then Big
Daddy turns around and looks up at Flyer

BIG DADDY
Aren’t you coming Flyer If it weren’t
for you none of this would be possible

ROVER
Hey that’s true

Everyone looks up and agrees

JULIET
Three cheers for Flyer

Everyone CHEERS Flyer turns bright red

FLYER
Come on now you’re making
me blush

EXT VERONA

People are shocked as they watch the dogs and cats walk side
by side through the city together Rover and Juliet turn to
one another and smile Flyer is above them filled with joy

FLYER (VO)

Well I guess we’re one up on ol’ William
S At least our story has a happy
ending And not just for the Cat-Pulets
and The Mongrels

INT VILLA - MONTAGE

The Capulets are playing with their cats Lady Capulet
brings Juliet up to her face and smiles Tyblat is petting
Doc

FLYER (VO)

The Capulets finally noticed their cats
and found comfort in their company It
helped to make the lost of their daughter
a little less painful

EXT PIAZZA - MONTAGE

Lord Montague sees the Butcher yelling at Rover He walks
over pays the Butcher for his steaks and takes Rover in his
arms

FLYER (VO)

The same can be said of the Montagues
They hadn’t forgotten that Rover was
their son’s favorite stray

INT MONTAGUES’ VILLA - MONTAGE

Rover lives in the lap of luxury A SERVANT feeds him steaks
and a gold water bowl with his name on it

FLYER (VO)
As a way of remembering Romeo the family
took Rover in and showered him with
affection They made a little puppy’s
dream of living inside come true

Rover waits until the servant has gone then lets the rest of
his family in through the doggy door

FLYER (VO) (cont’d)
So you see Sometimes things turn out
better than anyone could have ever
expected Oops I just remembered
There’s one more page to this story

EXT CAT-PULETS GARDEN - NIGHT

The Cat-pulets and The Mongrels throw a huge bash Outside
the gate Juliet waits A few seconds later Rover shows up

ROVER
Sorry I’m late It was filet mignon
tonight

JULIET

That’s all right I’ve got some great
news The Capulets are taking me on a
trip with them to Rome

ROVER
Wow That’s great Just be careful
around the Coliseum I hear its crawling
with bachelor cats

JULIET
Ooh jealous

ROVER
A little

Juliet snuggles close to Rover

JULIET
Ready

ROVER
Ready

They kiss and walk into the party Just then

EVERYONE
SURPRISE

A banner rolls down It reads ‘CONGRATULATIONS ROVER AND
JULIET’

JULIET
It’s a wedding reception

ROVER
For us

JULIET
Would you care to dance

ROVER
Absolutely

The Penguin orchestra plays their song Juliet and Rover are
joined by other cats and dogs dancing together

Flyer hovers above and watches the joyous celebration A
moment later he hears somebody cooing for him Flyer turns
and finds a PRETTY FEMALE DOVE smiling and giving him the
eye

FLYER
Ah Verona What a town

And they sail off into the starry night

THE END
