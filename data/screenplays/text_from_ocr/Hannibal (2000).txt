INT PANEL VAN - DAY

Clarice Starling is dead laid out in fatigues across a bench
in the back of a ratty rattling undercover van Three other
agents sit perched on the opposite bench staring at her
lifeless body

BURKE
How can she sleep at a time like this

BRIGHAM
Shes on a jump-out squad all night
shes saving her strength

INT UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY

Gray cement walls blur past as the panel van descends a
circular ramp to a lower level As it straightens out the
view through the windshield reveals a gathering of men and
vehicles - marked and unmarked DC police cars - and two black
SWAT vans

The panel van - with Marcells Crab House painted on its
sides - pulls to a stop The back doors open from the inside
and Starling is the first one out - well-rested and alert -
hoisting down her equipment bag

One of the DC policemen the one whose girth and manner

say hes in charge watches the woman by the van slip into a
Kevlar vest drop a Colt 45 into a shoulder holster and a
-38 into an ankle holster She straightens up approaches
the men and lays a street plan across the hood of one of
their cars

STARLING
All right everyone pay attention
Heres the layout -

BOLTON
Excuse me Im Officer Bolton DC Police

STARLING
Yes I can see that from your uniform
and badge how do you do

BOLTON
Im in charge here

Starling studies him a moment He sniffs as if that might
help confirm his weighty position

STARLING
You are

BOLTON
Yes maam

Starlings glance finds Brighams His says Just let it
go Hers says back I cant

STARLING
Officer Bolton Im Special Agent
Starling and just so we dont get off
on the wrong foot let me explain why
were all here

Brigham shakes his head to himself in weary anticipation of
her explanation

STARLING

Im here because I know Evelda Drumgo
Ive arrested her twice on RICO warrants
I know how she thinks DEA and BATF in
addition to backing me up are here for
the drugs and weapons Youre here and
its the only reason youre here because
our mayor wants to appear tough on drugs
especially after his own cocaine
conviction and thinks he can accomplish
that by the mere fact of having you tag
along with us

Silence as the gathering of agents and policemen stare at her
and Bolton

BOLTON
You got a smart mouth lady

STARLING
Officer if you wouldnt mind Id
appreciate it if you took a step or two
back youre in my light

Bolton takes his time but eventually backs away a step

STARLING
Thank you All right
(re the street plan)
The fish market backs on the water
Across the street ground floor is the
meth lab --

EXT FISH MARKET AND STREETS - DAY

The Macarena blares from a boom box Snappers artfully
arranged in schools on ice stare up blankly Crabs scratch
at their crates Lobsters climb over one another in tanks

One of the black SWAT vans turns down a side street The
other takes an alley The Marcells Crab House van continues
straight along Parcell Street

INT PANEL VAN - DAY

A 150-pound block of dry ice tries to cool down the heat
from all the bodies in the van - Starling and Brigham the
two other agents Burke and Hare and her new best friend
Officer Bolton As they drive along Bolton watches as she
takes several pairs of surgical gloves from her equipment
bag slips one pair on and hands the rest to the others the
last pair offered to him

STARLING

Drumgos HIV positive and she will spit
and bite if shes cornered so you might
want to put these on

(Bolton takes the gloves and

puts them on)
And if you happen to be the one who
puts her in a patrol car in front of the
cameras and I have a feeling you will
be you dont want to push her head down
shell likely have a needle in her hair
EXT FISH MARKET AREA - DAY

The swat vans pull into position one to the side of the
building across from the fish market the other around back
As the battered van pulls to the curb in front a mint low-
rider Impala convertible stereo thumping cruises past

INT PANEL VAN - DAY

The thumping fades leaving the Macarena filtering in

Starling pulls the cover off the eyepiece of a periscope

bolted to the ceiling of the van and makes a full rotation

of the objective lens concealed in the roof ventilator catching
glimpses of

A man with big forearms cutting up a mako shark with a
curved knife hosing the big fish down with a powerful hand-
held spray

Young men idling on a corner in front of a bar Others
lounging in parked cars talking Some children playing by
a burning mattress on the sidewalk others in the rainbow
spray from the fishmongers hose

The building across from the fish market with the metal door
above concrete steps It opens

STARLING
Heads up

A large white man in a luau shirt and sandals comes out
with a satchel across his chest other hand behind the case
A wiry black man comes out the door behind him carrying a
raincoat and behind him Evelda Drumgo

STARLING
Its her Behind two guys Both
packing

BRIGHAM

(into a radio)
Strike One to all units Showdown
Shes out front were moving

Starling and the others put on their helmets Brigham racks
the slide of his riot gun The back doors opena and Starling
is the first one out barking -

STARLING
Down on the ground Down on the ground

No one gets down on the ground - not Evelda Drumgo not her
men none of the merchants or bystanders The Macarena keeps
blaring

Drumgo turns and Starling sees the baby in the blanketed
sling around her neck She can also hear the roar of a big
V8 and hopes its her backup

Drumgo turns slightly and the baby blanket flutters as the
MAC 10 under it fires shattering Brighams face shield As
he goes down Hawaiian Shirt drops his satchel and fires a
shotgun blowing out the car window next to Burke

Gunshots from the V8 a Crip gunship a Cadillac coming
toward Starling Two shooters Cheyenne-style in the rolled-
down window frames spraying automatic fire over the top

Starling dives behind two parked cars Hare and Bolton
fire from behind another Auto glass shatters and clangs on
the ground

Everyone in the market scrambling for cover finally hitting
the fish-bloodied cement The Macarena still blasting

Pinned down Starling watches the wiry black man drop back
against the building Drumgo picks up the satchel the gunship
slowing enough for someone to pull her in

Starling stands and fires several shots taking out Hawaiian
Shirt the other man by the building the driver of the accel-
erating Cadillac one of the men perched on the window frames
- drops the magazine out of her 45 slams another in

before the empty hits the ground

The Cadillac goes out of control sideswiping a line of

cars grinds to a stop against them Starling moving toward
it now following the sight of her gun A shooter still
sitting in a window frame alive but trapped chest
compressed between the Cadillac and a parked car Gunfire
from somewhere behind Starling hits him and shatters the rear
window

STARLING
Hold it Hold your fire Watch the door
behind me Evelda

The firing stops but the pounding of The Macarena doesnt

STARLING
Evelda Put your hands out the window

Nothing for a moment Then Drumgo emerges from the car head
down hands buried in the blanket-sling cradling the crying
baby

STARLING

Show me your hands

(Evelda doesnt)
Please Show me your hands

Evelda looks up at her finally fondly it seems doesnt show
her hands
DRUMGO
Is that you Starling

STARLING
Show me your hands

DRUMGO
How you been

STARLING
Dont do this

DRUMGO
Do what

She smiles sweetly The blanket flutters Starling falls
Fires high enough to miss the baby Hits Drumgo in the neck
She goes down

Starling crawling in the street the wind knocked out of

her from the hits to her chest to her vest Reaches Drumgo
blood gushing out of her onto the baby She pulls out a
knife Cuts the harness straps Runs with the baby to the
merchant stalls as enterprising tourists click shots from the
ground with disposable cameras

Starling sweeps away knives and fish guts from a cutting
table Lays the baby down Strips it Grabs the handheld
sprayer and washes at the slick coating of HIV positive blood
covering the baby a sharks head staring Macarena pounding
disposable cameras clicking the river of bloody water
running along a gutter to where Brigham lies dead

EXT ARLINGTON CEMETERY - DAY

Gray sky Rain coming down A large gathering many in
uniform standing in wet grass around an open grave the rain
spilling off the rims of their umbrellas

A casket is being lowered in Starling watches as it
decends watches the gears of the hoist working and the box
disappearing beneath the edge of the muddy hole not allowing
herself to cry or to meet the eyes of certain other mourners
watching her

EXT ARLINGTON CEMETERY - LATER - DAY

Long line of parked cars some marked most not many with
government plates Smoke plumes from the exhaust of the one
idling nearest a Crown Victoria

Inside the car Starling sits in the front passenger seat
with a cardboard box on her lap a middle-aged man in Marine
dress blues beside her at the wheel The wipers slap back
and forth

HAWKINS
You like to think
things would fill
box

Starling touches the things
couple of laminated clip-on

when its over your
more than one cardboard

in the box a BATF badge a
ID cards with Brighams face on

them a medal a pen set a compass paper-weight two guns
and a framed desk photo of a dog

HAWKINS
Johns parents dont want it Any of
it Except the dog Dont want to be
reminded

STARLING
I want to be reminded

HAWKINS
I figured He was your last compadre on
the street wasnt he

STARLING
My last compadre

and will continue to
Eventually she folds down the
Hawkins looks up ahead -

He sits watching her touch the things
do so as long as she wants
cardboard flaps

HAWKINS
All theyll get with tinted windows is
pictures of themselves but it wont stop
them from trying You ready

She is He pulls away from the curb A handful of wet
photographers appears in the windshields view up ahead
the car passes their cameras swing around to point at
Starlings side of it and flash like stars

As

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - FBI DC FIELD OFFICE - DAY

The words Fidelity Bravery Integrity skew as a glass
door opens Starling comes in to find several men awaiting
her all balanced on Florsheim wingtips and tasseled Thom

McAn loafers

PEARSALL

Agent Starling this is John Eldredge
from DEA Assistant Director Noonan of
course you know Larkin Wayne from our
Office of Professional Responsibility
Bob Sneed BATF Benny Holcome Assistant
to the Mayor and Paul Krendler - you
know Paul Pauls come over from Justice
- unofficially - as a favor to us In
other words hes here and hes not here

A couple of the men bobbed their heads at the mention of
their names none offered his hand Starling sits a thin
manila folder on her lap A silence stretches out as each
man regards her Finally -

SNEED
I take it youve seen the coverage in
the papers and on television
(nothing from Starling)
Agent Starling

STARLING
I have nothing to do with the news Mr
Sneed

SNEED

The woman had a baby in her arms There
are pictures You can see the problem

STARLING

Not in her arms in a sling across her
chest In her arms she had a MAC 10
Mr Pearsall This is a friendly
meeting right

PEARSALL
Absolutely

STARLING
Then why is Mr Sneed wearing a wire

Pearsall glances to Sneed and his tie clasp Sneed sighs

SNEED
Were here to help you Starling
Thats going to be harder to do with a
combative attitude like -

STARLING
Help me what Your agency called this
office and got me assigned to help you on
the raid I gave Drumgo a chance - two
chances - to surrender She didnt She
fired She shot John Brigham She shot
at me And I shot her In that order
You might want to check your counter
right there where I admit it

A silence before the man from the Mayors Office speaks up

HOLCOME
Ms Starling did you make some kind
of inflammatory remark about Ms Drumgo
in the van on the way

STARLING
Is that what your Officer Bolton is
saying
(he chooses not to say)
I explained to him and the others in
the van that Drumgo was HIV positive and
would think nothing of infecting them
and me any way she could given the
chance If thats inflamma -

HOLCOME
Did you also say to him at one point
that a splash of Canoe is not the same
as a shower
(she doesnt answer)
Did Officer Bolton smell bad to you

STARLING
Incompetence smells bad to me

HOLCOME
You shot five people out there Agent
Starling That may be some kind of
record Is that how you define
competence

A beeper goes off Every one of the men checks the little
box on his belt Its Noonans He excuses himself from the
room

STARLING
Can I speak freely Mr Pearsall
(he nods)
This raid was an ugly mess I ended
up in a position where I had a choice of
dying or shooting a woman carrying a
child I chose I shot her -

FLASHCUT to Drumgo - hit in the neck by Starlings bullet -
silently falling to the ground -

STARLING
I killed a mother holding her child
The lower animals dont do that And I
regret it I resent myself for it But
I resent you too - whichever of you
thinks that by attacking me bad press
will go away That Waco will go away A
mayors drug habit All of it

FLASHCUT to Drumgo lying dead in the road then back here
again to Starling watching her in silence

Noonan pokes his head in gestures to Pearsall to join him
in the anteroom Krendler invites himself along Sneed and
Holcome get up and stare out the window Eldredge paces his
wingtips soundlessy dragging on the carpet

WAYNE
I know you havent had a chance to write
your 302 yet Starling but -

STARLING
I have sir A copys on its way to
your office I also have a copy with me
if you want to review it now Everything
I did and saw

She hands it to him He begins leafing through it
Pearsall and Krendler reappear -

PEARSALL
Assistant Director Noonan is on his way
back to his office Gentlemen Im going
to call a halt to this meeting and get
back to you individually by phone

Sneed cocks his head like a confused dog

SNEED
Weve got to decide some things here

PEARSALL
No we dont

SNEED
Clint -

PEARSALL

Bob believe me we dont have to decide
anything right this second I said Ill
get back to you

(Pearsalls look to Starling

says shes free to leave she

gets up)
And Bob

Pearsall grabs the wire behind Sneeds tie and pulls it down
hard the adhesive tape taking some chest hair along with it -
judging from the grimace - as it comes away from his skin

PEARSALL
You ever come in here wired again Ill
stick it up your ass

INT HALL OUTSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

Krendler - the only man who didnt speak in the meeting -
idles outside As Starling approaches -

KRENDLER
That was no free lunch Starling
Ill call you

She keeps going He admires the back of her legs

EXT COUNTRY CLUB - MIAMI - DAY
Jack Crawford misses a 20-foot putt by inches

GOLF PAL
Oh bad luck Jack

Crawford stares at the missed shot Then spikes across the
18th green taps it in and groans the way anyone over forty
does as he bends down to retrieve it

Pocketing it he turns sees Starling standing outside the
club house She waves bending just a couple of fingers and
he smiles pleased but not surprised to see her

EXT MIAMI - DAY

Crawford and Starling driving in his car the clubs in the
back seat Palm trees float by

STARLING
Whats your handicap

CRAWFORD
My handicap is I cant play golf

STARLING
Maybe better clubs would help

CRAWFORD
I play with the best clubs money can buy
Its not the clubs its a woeful lack of
talent

STARLING
Or interest

He nods - yeah thats the real problem with it - turns onto
another street

CRAWFORD
Were my flowers at Johns service okay
Lot of times flowers by wire you never
know

STARLING
They were canary daffodils
(he groans)
I put your name on my flowers

CRAWFORD
Thank you

STARLING
Thank you For the call At the
Inquisition I dont know what you said
to them but it worked
CRAWFORD
Dont thank me too quickly

EXT MIAMI - DAY
Downtown Skyscrapers
INT BUILDING - DAY

Frameless glass doors in a sleek office building etched
Allied Security Threat Assessment Miami Los Angeles Rio
de Janeiro Crawford holds one open for Starling and
follows her into a handsome reception area

RECEPTIONIST
How was it Better today

CRAWFORD
The clubs are in the dumpster downstairs
if anyone wants them

He leads Starling deeper into the place past pairs of men
in nice suits conferring in the doorway of a kitchenette and
over by a long bank of filing cabinets Male and female
secretaries move about

CRAWFORD
Nice huh This could all be yours
Starling I can get you a PI ticket in
Florida tomorrow you can chase insurance
scams extortion against the cruise
lines put down the gun and have some fun
with me

Crawford accepts a handful of pink phone-message slips as
they come past his secretarys desk holds another door open
and Starling steps into his office

STARLING
Tempting

CRAWFORD
Just wait

The door closing softly behind her says expensive
hardware

INT CRAWFORDS OFFICE - DAY

They sit Crawford behind his mahogany desk Starling in a
comfortable chair As he rifles through the phone
messages -

CRAWFORD
The call I made wasnt to Assistant
Director Noonan Whoever called him I
dont know JI called Mason Verger
He lets the name sink in lets her dive for it try to
place it She cant Its familiar but doesnt connect to
anything stable

CRAWFORD
Lecters fourth victim Starling
The one who lived if you can call it
living The rich one

He slides over a couple of photographs of a young man with a
kind trusting face Now she remembers him

CRAWFORD
I told Mason I wanted you off the
street I told him what I told you when
I left the Bureau You go out with a gun
enough times you will be killed by one
I told him I want you where you belong
in Behavioral Science Know what he said

STARLING
He can speak

CRAWFORD

Its about the only thing he can do
He said after a very long pause Oh
what a good idea Jack

(Crawford tries to smile)
Who he called I dont know Someone
higher up than anyone in that room with
you Maybe Representative Vollmer who
Mason may not own but does rent from
time to time

Silence as Starling tries to take it all in She looks up
with a question forming in her mind and Crawford nods before
she can say it Very matter of fact -

CRAWFORD
Yeah thats right it means going back
on the Lecter case

He busies himself with the phone messages again arranging
them in little prioritized piles on his desk as if perhaps
this conversation is about nothing more important than a
simple missing person case

STARLING
What if I said to you Id rather not
do that What if I said to you I prefer
the street

CRAWFORD
You think this is a cheap deal What
you were getting was a cheap deal What
they say about federal examiners is true
they arrive after the battle and bayonet
the wounded Youre not safe on the
street anymore

Starling takes another look at the photographs of Verger

STARLING
Has something happened on the case

CRAWFORD

Has Lecter killed anybody lately I
wouldnt know Im retired from all that
Mason doesnt know either but he does
apparently have some new information -
which hell only share with you

They consider one another for a long moment Finally -

CRAWFORD
Hes not pretty Starling And I dont
just mean his face

EXT MARYLAND - DAY

Bare trees Overcast sky Starlings Mustang growling along
the rain-slicked expressway

INT MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY

A Maryland state map spread out across the passenger seat
Starlings eyes darting back and forth between the black and
red route-veins and the shrouded countryside out beyond the
slapping wiper blades

An exit sign - and the exit itself - looms suddenly and
rushes across the right side of her windshield She curses
to herself Its the exit she wanted but now its gone
shrinking in her rearview mirror into the mist

EXT THE VERGER ESTATE - DAY

Coming back the other way along a service road Starling
slows to consider a chain-link gate stretched across a muddy
road then continues on

At the gate house of the main entrance a security guard
checks her name against a list He seems reluctant to get
himself or his clipboard wet but not her identification
handing it out past the edge of his umbrella to her

The Mustang negotiates a long circuitous drive taking her
deeper and deeper into vast forest land Eventually though
a good mile from the gate house behind her the trees give
way to a clearing and she sees the big Stanford White-
designed mansion emerging from the mist up ahead

A man waits under an umbrella out front indicates to her
where to park - anywhere one should think - theres enough
space for fifty cars - then comes around to the drivers side
and opens the door

CORDELL
Ms Starling Hi Im Cordell Mr
Vergers private physician

STARLING
How do you do

She gathers her things out from under the map file folder
micro-cassette recorder extra tapes and batteries He helps
her out then presses up against her to help maximize the
umbrellas effectiveness

CORDELL
Shall we make a run for it

As they hurry toward the porch - if it can be called a
porch as grand an entrance as a kings or English rock
stars manor - Starling notices the buildings one modern
wing sticking out like an extra limb attached in some
grotesque medical experiment

INT VERGERS MANSION - DAY

They cross through a living room larger than most houses
then down a hall their shoes moving along a Moroccan runner
sleeves past portraits of important-looking dead people

As they cross a threshold theres an abrupt shear in style
the rich carpet giving way to polished institutional floors
the portrait-lined walls to shiny white enamel

Cordell reaches for the handle of a closed door in the new
wing and Starling notices line of lights appear around the
jamb where there were none

As the door opens she squints Two small photographers
spots on stands pitch narrow beams of light into her face and
seem to follow her progress into the room

CORDELL
(a whisper)
Ones eyes adjust to the darkness
This way is better

He leads her to a sitting area where a print of William
Blakes The Ancient of Days hangs above a large aquarium
divided in two by a wall of glass - an ell gliding around on
one side a fish on the other A bank of security monitors
completes the decor To the spotlight -

CORDELL
Mr Verger Ms Starling is here
The light stands flank a hospital bed the beams effectively
camouflaging the figure on it in their glare

STARLING
Good morning Mr Verger

MASON
Cordell do you address a judge as Mr

The voice is steady and resonant An educated voice not
unlike Lecters Before Cordell can answer him -

MASON
Agent Starling is her proper title
not Ms

CORDELL

Agent Starling

MASON
Correct Good morning Agent Starling
Have a seat Make yourself comfortable

STARLING
Thank you

Starling sits with her things Snaps open the little door of
her cassette recorder to verify theres a tape inside

MASON
Was that a Mustang I heard out there

STARLING
Yes it was

MASON
Five-liter

STARLING
88 Stroker

MASON
Fast

STARLING
Yes

MASON

Whered you get it

STARLING
Dope auction

MASON
Very good

STARLING
Mr Verger the discussion were going

to have is in the nature of a deposition
Ill need to tape record it if thats all
right with you

MASON
Cordell I think you can leave us now

CORDELL
I thought I might stay Perhaps I could
be useful if -

MASON
You could be useful seeing about my
lunch

Starling gets up but not to see him out Once hes gone -

STARLING
Id like to attach this microphone to
your - clothing or pillow - if youre
comfortable with that

MASON
By all means

She walks slowly toward the bed or rather to the lights
uncertain exactly what position Verger may be in - on his
back his side she has no way of knowing

MASON
Here this should make it easier

A finger like a pale spider crab moves along the sheet and
depresses a button The lights suddenly extinguish and
Starlings pupils dilate As her eyes adjust to the darkness
Vergers face materializes in it like something dead rising

up through dark water

Face is

the wrong word He has no face to speak of No

skin at least Teeth he has He looks like some kind of
creature that resides in the lowest depths of the sea

She doesnt flinch Maybe the hand with the microphone

recoils
flannel
side of
next to

an inch or two but thats it She clips it to the
lapel of his pajamas drapes the skinny cord over the
the pillow and sets the recorder on the medical table
the bed

MASON
You know I thank God for what happened
It was my salvation Have you accepted
Jesus Agent Starling Do you have
faith

STARLING
I was raised Lutheran
MASON
Thats not what I asked -

STARLING
This is Special Agent Clarice Starling
FBI number 5143690 deposing Mason R
Verger Social Security number -

MASON
- 475-98-9823 -

STARLING
- at his home on the date stamped above
sworn and attested
(she drags over a chair)
Mr Verger you claim to have -

MASON
I want to tell you about summer camp
It was a wonderful childhood experience -

STARLING
We can get to that later The -

MASON

We can get to it now You see it all
comes to bear its where I met Jesus and
Ill never tell you anything more impor-
tant than that It was a Christian camp
my father paid for Paid for the whole
thing all 125 campers on Lake Michigan
Many of them were unfortunate cast-off
little boys and girls would do anything
for a candy bar Maybe I took advantage
of that Maybe I was rough with them -

STARLING
Mr Verger I dont need to know about
the sex offenses I just -

MASON

Its all right I have immunity so

its all right now I have immunity from
the US Attorney I have immunity from
the DA in Owings Mills I have
immunity from the Risen Jesus and nobody
beats the Riz

STARLING

What Id like to know is if youd ever
seen Dr Lecter before the court assigned
you to him for therapy

MASON
You mean - socially
(laughs)
STARLING
That is what I mean yes Werent you
both on the board of the Baltimore Phil-
harmonic

MASON

Oh no my seat was just because my
family contributed I sent my lawyer
when there was a vote

STARLING

Then Im not sure I understand how he
ended up at your house that night if
you dont mind talking about it

MASON
Not at all Im not ashamed

STARLING
I didnt say you should be

MASON
I invited him of course He was too
professional to just sort of drop in
I answered the door in my nicest come-
hither leather outfit

FLASHCUT of the door opening revealing Verger in his
leather gear his face young and pretty

MASON
I was concerned hed be afraid of me
but he didnt seem to be Afraid of me
thats funny now

FLASHCUT of Verger leading Lecter upstairs each with a glass
of wine in hand

MASON
I showed him my toys my noose set-up
among other things - where you sort of
hang yourself but not really It feels
good while you - you know

FLASHCUT to some dogs watching Verger with the noose around
his neck and Lecter offering him some amyl nitrite

MASON
Anyway - he said Would you like a
popper Mason I said Would I And
whoa once that kicked in I knew it was
more than simple amyl it was some kind
of custom meth-angel-acid highball
Lovely I was flying -

FLASHBACK to Masons image in a full-length mirror shattering
as Lecter kicks it

MASONS VOICE
The good doctor came over with a piece
of broken mirror Mason he said -

LECTER
- show me how you smile to get the
confidence of a child

Lecter holds a shard of mirror glass in front of him

LECTER
Uh-huh Do you ever smile Oh I see
how you do it
Now Mason lets say you had to hide
that kindly fictitious mask How would
you do it

Verger tries to look serious or mean but his features are
just too sweet even with a noose around his neck

LECTER
No I still see it Try again
(Verger tries again)
No No Im afraid not Try this
(hands him the glass)
Try peeling off your face with this and
feeding it to the dogs

As Verger lifts the broken glass to his face -

BACK TO the faceless Verger in the bed his claw of a hand
gripping invisible glass -

MASON
Well you know the rest
(shrugs)
Seemed like a good idea at the time

Starling looks like someone who has just received much more
information than she ever needed or wanted Cordell comes in
quietly with Vergers lunch on a rolling cart and trying not
to interrupt arranges the silverware and pours some water

STARLING
Mr Verger you -

MASON
Are you shocked Agent S

STARLING
You indicated to -
(her eyes dart to the tape and
his follow them)
- to my office - that youve received
some kind of new information
MASON
Look in the drawer of the end table

Starling takes out a pair of thin cotton gloves and puts
them on In the drawer she finds a large manila envelope and
in it an x-ray of an arm

STARLING
Where did this come from

MASON
Buenos Aires I received it two weeks
ago

STARLING

Wheres the package it came in

MASON
The package it came in good question
I dont know There was nothing written
on it of interest Did I throw it out

Starling smells a rat but keeps it to herself Takes a
closer look at the x-ray while Cordell busies himself climb-
ing a step ladder next to the aquarium

MASON
Think it will help I hope so I hope
itll help you catch him if for no other
reason than to heal the stigma of your
recent dishonor

She switches off the tape recorder

STARLING
Thank you thats all I -

MASON
Did you feel some rapport with Dr
Lecter in your talks at the asylum
I know I did while I was peeling

STARLING
We exchanged information in a civil way

MASON
But always through the glass

STARLING
Yes

MASON
The eel and fish become accustomed to
each other through the glass Theyre
even company for one another
Cordells gloved hand grips the snapper and transfers it to
the other side of the aquarium where the eel at once rips a
piece out of it Starling tries to ignore it and reaches to
unclip the microphone from Vergers pajames lapel

MASON
Isnt it funny

Nothing is particularly funny to her right now

STARLING
Whats that

MASON
You can look at my face but you shied
when I said the name of God

INT EVIDENCE STORAGE - QUANTICO - DAY
A clerk is cataloging strange items from another case as
Starling inspects what he brought her on Lecter Theres not

much there One cardboard box-worth some files video tape

CLERK
Not finding what you want

STARLING
Are you sure this is all of it

CLERK
Thats all of it now There used to be
more but its been picked over little by
little over the years Its worth a lot
of money in certain circles Like the
cocaine that disappears around here
Little by little

INT BASEMENT - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE - DAY

The room Starlings been given to work out of used to be

the departments basement darkroom Theres almost nothing

In truth she isnt really browsing either Shes stealing
glances at the proprietor behind the glass-top trading card-
filled counter

the proprietor pays more attention to than her Quietly -

in Hannibal Lecter memorabilia

thousand dollars for an x-ray of Hannibal

The dime drops Just a fleeting spark of realization

PROPRIETOR
No if you paid me ten thousand dollars
for an x-ray of Hannibal Lector I would
possess a money order or cashiers check

EXT MARYLAND-MISERACORDIA GENERAL HOSPITAL - DAY

A wailing siren Ambulance pulling up in front of an
Emergency Entrance Paramedics climb out hoist down a
gurney and the bleeding gunshot victim on in and hurry him
in past the automatic doors The doors thump shut

A moment later they open again and an orderly - same one

from the tape - steps out finished with his shift coat over
his uniform He hitches up his collar and steps out into the
drizzling rain as Starling across the street in a hooded
sweatshirt watches

EXT STREETS - LATER - DAY

The orderly moves along a wet sidewalk heading home
Starling following at a distance He stops She stops He
glances to something in the middle of the street A dead
dove one wing fluttering in the wind He looks up Sees
its mate pacing on a wire Car tires hiss past below

Starling watches as he crosses to the center of the street
picks up the dead dove and pockets it crosses back and
continues on She and the surviving bird follow

INT APARTMENT BUILDING - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY

Starling knocks Waits The door opens and the orderly
peers out with the dead dove in his hands

STARLING
Hi Barney I need to talk with -

BARNEY
Would you agree for the record Officer
Starling Ive not been read my rights

STARLING
This is just informal I just need to
ask you about some stuff

BARNEY
How about saying it into your handbag

Starling opens her purse and speaks down into it as though
there were a troll inside -
STARLING
I have not Mirandized Barney He is
unaware of his rights

Barney widens the door so she can come in
INT BARNEYS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Barney sets the dove on a desk and drags a computer mouse

to the file close x Just before the screen reverts to the
AOL Welcome page Starling glimpses the site he was on when
she interrupted him with her knock - stock quotes

STARLING
How you been

He doesnt answer Sits his huge frame down on his desk
chair She moves some newspapers aside on a couch one of
which shows a photo of her from the Drumgo raid They
consider each other for a moment Eventually -

STARLING
Barney back when you turned Dr Lecter
over to the Tennessee Police -

BARNEY
They werent civil to him And theyre
all dead now

STARLING
Yeah They only managed to survive his
company three days You survived him six
years at the asylum Howd you do that
It wasnt just being civil

BARNEY
Yes it was

They both hear something - a flutter - and glance out to the
fire escape The dead doves mate has landed on the railing

STARLING
Did you ever think once he escaped
he might come after you

BARNEY
No He told me once that whenever
feasible he preferred to eat the rude
Free-range rude he called them

He smiles Glances out the window again to the cooing dove
Picks up the dead one carries it out and sets it down on the
wet grating

STARLING
Any idea what happened to all his stuff
His books and papers and drawings and -
BARNEY
Everything got thrown out when the place
closed

He comes back in She starts to say something hesitates
Once she starts on this subject she knows one of them will
wind up very unhappy

STARLING
Barney I just found out that Dr
Lecters signed copy of The Joy of
Cooking went to a private collector for
sixteen thousand dollars

BARNEY
It was probably a fake

STARLING
The sellers affidavit of ownership
was signed Karen Phlox You know Karen
Phlox You should She filled out
your employment application only at the
bottom she signed it Barney Same thing
on your tax returns

Long silence Then Barney sighs

BARNEY
You want the book Maybe I could get
it back

STARLING

I want the x-ray From when you broke
his arm after he attacked that nurse

Barney gets up again but doesnt run off to get it He
slowly paces around

BARNEY
We talked about a lot of things late at
night after all the screaming died down
We talked about you sometimes Want to
know what he said

STARLING
No just the x-ray

BARNEY
Is there a reward

STARLING
Yeah The reward is I dont have my
friend the Postal Inspector nail you on
Use of the Mails to Defraud you dont
get ten years and you dont come out
with a janitors job and a room at the Y
sitting on the side of your bunk at night
listening to yourself cough

He stares at her gets up finally disappears into the
bedroom Starling looks out to the fire escape again The
surviving dove has dropped down and is now walking in circles
around its lifeless mate

Barney returns with a file box and a large envelope Hands
it all to her She unfurls the string-clasp Pulls out an x-
ray of an arm A radiologists and Lecters names are on it

BARNEY
Im not a bad guy

STARLING
I didnt say you were

BARNEY
Dr Chilton is a bad guy After your
first visit he began taping your conver-
sations with Dr Lecter

He produces from his jacket pocket several cassette tapes
As he hands them to her -

BARNEY
I was good to you Tried to make it
easy for you the first time you came down
to the violent ward to interview Dr
Lecter Remember

STARLING
Yes

BARNEY
You remember saying thank you

She doesnt because she didnt and now regrets it

STARLING
Im sorry Thank you

BARNEY
You mean it

STARLING
Yes

BARNEY
Im going to show you something then
I dont have to show it to you remember
that But I believe your gratitude is
sincere

He goes to a fuse box on the wall Takes something out of
it Turns around to face Starling wearing the famous mask
from Silence of the Lambs and her hand flashes toward her
sidearm a movement quickly stopped

BARNEY
This is my retirement fund
(removes the mask)
If youll let me keep it I can a lot
of money for this and get out of here for
good I want to travel and see every
Vermeer in the world before I die

She thinks about it doesnt immediately answer him He
walks out onto the fire escape again and addresses the bird -

BARNEY
Go on Youve grieved long enough

He shoos the dove away picks up the dead one comes back
in and drops it in the wastebasket by his desk

STARLING
What did he say About me Late at
night

BARNEY
We were talking about inherited hard-
wired behavior He was using genetics in
roller pigeons as an example
They go way up in the air and roll over
backwards in a display falling toward
the ground There are shallow rollers
and deep rollers You cant breed two
deep rollers or the offspring will roll
all the way down crash and die He
said Officer Starling is a deep roller
Barney Lets hope one of her parents
was not

As Starling gets up and gathers everything except the mask
she hears the surviving dove call out once from somewhere in
the trees

INT FBI LAB - DAY

The two x-rays one overlaid on the other clipped to a
light box A technician adjusts them so the bone structures
correspond in position as closely as possible and points out
to Starling -

He slides the x-rays apart touches a thin gray line on one
of them -

INSANE - DAY - (FLASHBACK - 1994)

Its Lecters cell And its almost pitch black Then

as he turns a rheostat the lights slowly rise revealing the
cell to be almost empty stripped of its books Hes lying
on his cot

LECTER
Ive been in this room for eight years
Clarice I know they will never - ever -
let me out while Im alive What I want
is a view

EXT FLORENCE - DAY

One of the most magnificent views in the world

Drifting across it then down reveals a piazza below
Outside a cafe a figure in a dark overcoat his back to us
drops crumbs to a hundred pigeons surrounding him

Closer the pigeons swirl around his shoes And slowly the
figure turns to face us Its not Hannibal Lecter Its

someone we dont recognize

He lets go the last of the crumbs brushes his gloves
together and crosses toward the ancient Palazzo Vecchio
glancing once at its high stone walls and arched windows
its medieval bell tower soaring into the sky

INT PALAZZO VECCHIO - DAY

Checking his watch but in no hurry he climbs a flight

of marble steps Unlike here one more often smokes indoors
than out and the man lights an MS cigarette his reward for
reaching the landing

ECHOING VOICE
The Capponi correspondence goes back to
the 13th Century Dr Fell might hold in
his hand in his non-Italian hand a note
from Dante Alighieri himself but would
he recognize it I think not -

He follows the echoing voice to the open doorway of a large
frescoed room the Salon of Lilies where another gentleman
loitering outside it pats at his pockets The man weve
been following offers along with an outstretched hand
holding his pack of cigarettes -

PAZZI
Theyre still arguing

RICCI
(nodding)
The curatorship Sogliato wants the
job for his nephew The scholars seem
satisfied with the temporary guy they
appointed

Pazzi lights Ricci glances down the hall to the far end
where a janitor slowly guides a floor polisher back and forth
like a big weak motorcycle then crosses to and peers into
the Salon

Its under long-term restoration scaffolding everywhere

A large assembly of men ranging in age from middle-aged to
the Middle Ages it seems are gathered around a long 12th-
century table The echoing voice belongs to -

SOGLIATO
You have examined him in medieval
Italian and Ill not deny his language
is admirable For a straniero But what
if he came upon a note in the Capponi
library say from Guido deCavalcanti to
Dante Would he recognize it I think
not

Pazzi isnt sure which one is Fell Scanning the room

from the doorway he tries to locate the source of the voice
but its difficult the high ceillings playing hell with the
acoustics -
DR FELL

Professor Sogliato if I might
Cavalcanti as we all know replied
publicly to Dantes first sonnet in La
Vita Nuova If he commented privately as
well if he wrote to a Cappono to which
would it be In your opinion

(Sogliato clearly cant even

name the Capponi)
No Not even a guess Andrea dont you
think Since he was more literary than
his brothers

Several of the other scholars nod their heads in agreement

which only embarrasses Sogliato more Pazzi knows which man
at the table Fell is now however he - and we - still cant

see his face seated as he is with his back to the door

SOGLIATO
If he is such an expert on Dante let
him lecture on Dante - to the Studiolo
Let him face them if he can

DR FELL
Id look forward to it Shall we set
the date now

Sogliato has had enough and gets up noisily gathering his
things As the meeting breaks up some of the other committee
members shake Fells hand Pazzi comes in and approaches
Fell - from behind - as the others straggle out

Fell turns Of course its Hannibal Lecter

Predecessor implies I have the job
Unfortunately I dont Not yet Though
Im hopeful They are letting me look
after the library For a stipend
Fell begins gathering his books and papers
neatly in his satchel

PAZZI
Yes Well -

DR FELL

What do you think happened to him

placing them

To your - to the Signore - who can say

Perhaps he ran off Bad debts

Bad love

Mostros victims He makes sure we find
them

DR FELL

I never actually met Signore de

Bonaventura I have read several of his

monographs in the Nuova Antologia

PAZZI

The officers who first checked didnt
find any sort of - farewell or - suicide

note I was wondering if -

DR FELL

If I happen to come across anything in
the Capponi Library stuffed in a book or
a drawer - yes Ill call you at once

He accepts Pazzis card and slips it under a paperclip

holding some of his notes together

PAZZI
Thank -

DR FELL
Youve been reassigned

Pazzi was just turning to leave Turns back

PAZZI
Pardon
DR FELL
You were on the Il Mostro case Im sure
I read

PAZZI
Thats right

And it was a humiliation being taken off of it which he
would no doubt rather not discuss here

DR FELL
Now youre on this This is much less -
grand - a case I would think

PAZZI
If I thought of my work in those terms
yes I guess Id agree

DR FELL
A missing person

Fell says it like its not worth saying Pazzis had enough
and turns to leave again

DR FELL
Were you unfairly dismissed from the
grander case Or did you deserve it

Pazzi looks back again Fell isnt even looking at him
putting things in his case

PAZZI
Regarding this one Dr Fell Are the
Signores personal effects still at the
Palazzo

DR FELL
Packed neatly in two cases with an
inventory Alas no note

PAZZI
Ill send someone over to pick them up
Thank you for your help

He starts to leave again

DR FELL
Have you thought about Botticelli

Pazzi looks back again What is Fell talking about

PAZZI
Not since middle school art class Im
afraid

DR FELL

Those awful pictures in the papers
of The Monsters victims His careful
arrangement of the young lovers bodies
The flowers The womens exposed left
breast The tableaux remind me of
Botticelli Dont they you

Frankly it never occurred to him Fell points to a place
just behind Pazzi and he turns to see a beautiful Botticelli
in a carved gold frame the woman lying in flowers her left
breast exposed Fell shrugs as he closes his satchel

DR FELL
Maybe a clue

EXT FELLS RESIDENCE - NIGHT

A row of family palaces in an ancient street A figure
walking on the cobblestones Only vaguely familiar his path
leads us to the front of an old residence its windows behind
iron grates all but one on an upper floor dark The figure
continues on down the street but we go inside -

INT FELLS RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Even though the foyer is dark we can tell its large and
high-ceilinged We become aware of music - Bachs Goldberg
Variations - but cant be sure where its coming from

We notice a staircase and decide to climb it Its longer
than we thought at first - its steps made of thick slabs of
ancient stone its rail of cold hammered iron

We reach the landing Notice a small darkened room to

one side But the music seems to be coming from elsewhere so
we continue on down the hall to a pair of tall double doors

open allowing us into the main salon The music seems to be

coming from somewhere in here

We move through the room illuminated only faintly by the
occasional candle look up to see that the height of the room
disappears into darkness then down again as we are almost
upon the figure sitting at a piano

Lecters fingers move among the yellowed ivory keys He
plays the Bach piece well every so often glancing to a lyre-
shaped music stand But coming slowing around the stand we
discover there is no sheet music on it but instead a copy of
the National Tattler with a picture of a black woman dead in
the street and another picture of Clarice Starling - the
FBIs ANGEL OF DEATH - washing down a baby next to the

head of a shark

LECTERS VOICE
Dear Clarice I have followed with
enthusiasm the course of your disgrace
and public shaming My own never
bothered me except for the inconvenience
of being incarcerated but you may lack
perspective -

INT FELLS RESIDENCE - LATER - NIGHT

Sitting at a 16th Century refectory table in a pool of lamp
light Lecter dips the tip of a fountain pen into an etched
glass bottle of ink and signs the letter he has just written

LECTERS VOICE
In our discussions down in the dungeon
it was apparent to me that your father -
the dead night watchman - figures large
in your value system

He adds a brief post-script folds the linen-fiber paper over
once careful to line up the edges gives it a sharp crease

LECTERS VOICE
I think your success in putting an end to
Jame Gumbs career as a couturier pleased
you most because you could imagine your
father being pleased

He places the letter in an envelope that is already addressed
to Special Agent Clarice Starling and seals it with wax He
places it into another slightly larger envelope that already
has written on it a Las Vegas Nevada address

EXT FLORENCE - DAY

Lecter strolls across a bridge over the Arno and drops his
envelope into a post box on the other side

by your disgrace Do you see him in his
plain pine box crushed by your failure
The sorry petty end of a promising
career

Piles of mail on the counter A middle-aged man slits open
the envelope from Italy takes out the smaller envelope puts
a stamp on it drops it onto a pile of outgoing mail and

prestigious 10 Most Wanted list

Annoyed at herself for getting her paw prints all over the

Vespas Fiats and Innocenti speed around a traffic circle
Pedestrians move along the boulevard We follow one man who
seems vaguely familiar - we glimpsed him briefly several days
ago walking past Fells residence just before we went in and
once before that if we recall polishing the floor in the
Palazzo Vecchio

Right now though were more interested in Pazzi who joins
the frame coming toward us and we follow him instead to and
up the steps of the Questura building

A couple of Pazzis colleagues ones who are now working on
the Il Mostro case instead of him surrounded by
photographs and clippings on the crimes exchange a look

DETECTIVE
Its the pretty young wife with the
ever-open beak who needs opera tickets

Pazzi glances over at them not sure he heard right One
sneaks a glance at the other Its all they can do to keep
from laughing The tape of the customers coming and going
at the perfume store contines but Pazzi doesnt notice

PAZZI
Botticelli

DETECTIVE
What

PAZZI

He arranges his victims like that
Botticelli painting You hadnt noticed

As Pazzi glances away from them he catches a glimpse of the
monitor of Fell coming into the perfume shop again He gets
up and the Il Mostro detectives thinking hes coming for
them decide to go out for coffee

continue until Pazzi hits the stop button and spins the jog
The young agent groans but not too loud Pazzi far outranks
him The image reverses Pazzi freezes it on one of the
step frames that shows Dr Fell

PAZZI
What is this

YOUNG AGENT
Security camera from a perfume shop on
Villa Della Scula FBI through Interpol
requested a copy

PAZZI
Why

YOUNG AGENT
They didnt say

PAZZI
They didnt say

YOUNG AGENT
It was actually kind of weird Like
they were making a point of not saying

Pazzi unpauses it Watches Fell approach the counter and
then wait it seems for a long time as the perfumer mixes up
some kind of concoction Money exchanges hands and Fell
with his purchase leaves

INT PAZZIS APARTMENT - STUDY - NIGHT

As a search engine works Pazzi glances down at copies of
Fells state work permit and Permesso di Soggiorno resting
next to the computer The video cassette is there too
And the over-night mailer

The FBIs consumer home page appears on the screen Pazzi
selects the 10 Most Wanted button and in a moment the list
- with pictures - is displayed
The World Trade Center bombing mastermind is 1 Beneath
him nine other lesser bombers and murderers none of whom
look anything like Fell

He shifts back to the main page Selects Archives The

50 Most Wanted list appears - bank robbers and killers and
arsonists all with photos or police sketches all but one
man He scrolls down stops Dr Fell - Hannibal Lecter -
Hannibal the Cannibal - is looking right at him

ALLEGRA

Rinaldo

He doesnt seem to hear her as he begins reading the text
under Lecters digitally-enhanced picture

ALLEGRA
Rinaldo

He glances up finally His young wife - who is indeed pretty
- stands in the doorway of the study

PAZZI
Im sorry

ALLEGRA
Are we going to the Teatro Michahelles

PAZZI
Yes

ALLEGRA
You got tickets

PAZZI
No But I will In fact I was just
about to look here
(on the Internet)

ALLEGRA
Please not the third balcony I would
like to see it

PAZZI
Not in the balcony No matter what the
cost

Unconvinced the promise will hold she leaves the room

Pazzi opens his filofax to the F tab finds a number written
under no heading a code enters it into his computer and in
a moment is taken to the FBIs private VICAP site - Violent

Criminal Apprehensopn Program

He types in Lecter and scans the internal 302 reports that
are displayed many of them prepared by Special Agent Clarice
Starling
He returns to the server screen Begins a new search
Hannibal Lecter Many of the same sites Starling found are
listed the ones posted by nuts

He scrolls down to the Refine Search panel Adds one word
to his Hannibal Lecter query Reward Hits Return

Only one site includes the word in its page name Pazzi goes
to it No graphics other than the same picture the FBI site
showed No indication of whose site it is

Dry text describes Lecter reminds the reader he should be
regarded as armed and dangerous and encourages informants to
call the provided FBI number with any information

There is also a private number listed - European dialing
code not US Oh and one more small piece of information
The reward 3000000

INT STARLINGS LECTEREUM - DAY
The place is looking more and more like a museum the

bulletin and blackboards covered now with notes and newsprint
photos including some of Il Mostros young victims

Paul Krendler makes his way through the right-angled
passageway leading into the darkened room The only light is
coming from a monitor showing Lecters escape from Memphis
as caught by high-angle security cameras

He considers a display Starling has erected to Lecters nine

known victims One is Mason Verger Another a man attached
to a tool shop peg board with metal rods piercing his body as
in an illustration next to it of the medieval Wound Man

He becomes intrigued by a sketch on a standing easel of
Starling signed by Hannibal Lecter A piece of cloth has
been tacked at the neck and drapes down like a sari Is she
naked underneath it Krendler has to find out As he
carefully lifts the cloth -

LECTERS VOICE
What is your worst memory of childhood

He jumps startled sees Starling sitting in a corner in the
shadows next to the cassette deck

STARLING
Can I help you Mr Krendler

KRENDLER
Jesus What are you doing sitting there
in the dark

STARLING
Thinking
She gets up Lets the tape of Lecters voice continue
Krendler works at slowing the pace of his heart at regaining
most of his unpleasant hauteur

KRENDLER
Some people in Justice are thinking
too Theyre thinking what exactly is
she doing about Lecter

STARLING
Thinking About cannibalism

KRENDLER
Whats the point of that are you
catching a crook or writing a book

STARLING
Arent you curious why he dines on his
victims

KRENDLER

Not particularly no

STARLING
To show his contempt for those who
exasperate him I think

Which she wouldnt mind showing Krendler in similar fashion

STARLING

Or sometimes to perform a public
service In the case of the flautist
Benjamin Raspail -

(shows him a picture)
- he did it to improve the sound of the
Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra serving
the not-so-talented flute players sweet-
breads to the board with a nice Chateau
dY quem at forty-six hundred dollars a
bottle That meal began with green
oysters from the Gironde followed by the
sweetbreads a sorbet and then you can
read here in Town and Country A notable
dark and glossy ragout the constituents
never determined on saffron rice Its
taste was darkly thrilling with great
bass tones that only the vast and careful
reduction of the fond can give

Krendler is looking at her not at the magazine Then -

KRENDLER
I always figured him for a queer

STARLING
Now why would you say that Paul
KRENDLER
All this artsy-fartsy stuff Chamber
music and tea-party food Not that I
mean anything personal if youve got a
lot of sympathy for those people

There wasnt a lot of spin on his words but they carried an
inkling of implication which she doesnt misinterpret She
ignores it though and him looks through her receipts

KRENDLER
What I came here to impress upon you
Starling is Id better see cooperation
There are no little fiefdoms I want to
be copied on every 302 Work with me and
your so-called career here might improve
If you dont all I have to do is draw a
line through your name rather than under
it and its over

He turns to leave

STARLING
Paul What is it with you I told you
to go home to your wife That was wrong

KRENDLER
Dont flatter yourself Starling Why
would I hold that against you That was
a long time ago and besides this town
is full of cornpone country pussy

He seems pleased he came up with the phrase so easily

KRENDLER
That said I wouldnt mind having a go
with you now if you want to reconsider

STARLING
In the gym anytime No pads

He smiles Leaves She sits down at her desk listens
to his footsteps down the hall fade glances at the tape of
Lecters escape

EXT FLORENCE - DAY

A fistful of 1000-lira coins makes a dull ching as Pazzi
shakes them in his hand like dice hes not sure he wants to
throw Hes staring at a pay phone ten paces away No ones
using it Its his if he wants it clearly he isnt sure

He finally walks over to it Lifts the receiver Presses
in the sequence of numbers scribbled in pen on the back of
the hand that holds the change
A series of long distance tones beeps like a tinny death
knell A tinny recorded voice tells him to deposit 9000-
lira for the first three minutes

He drops nine coins in the slot with a shaky hand The
call connects and another recorded voice tells him the number
he has dialed is no longer in service

He hangs up relieved Begins to walk away with his so-
called reputation intact The phone rings He looks back at
it It rings again He begins to walk toward it It rings
again He reaches for it hesitates picks it up and hears
a voice - not recorded - American accent - a man

VOICE
Yes
(Pazzi doesnt answer)
Hel-lo

PAZZI
I have information about Hannibal Lecter

VOICE
Does it include where he is now

PAZZI
Is the reward still in effect

VOICE
Yes it is Have you shared your infor-
mation with the police sir

PAZZI
No

VOICE
Im required to encourage you to do so

PAZZI
Uh-huh Is the reward payable under
special circumstances

VOICE
Do you mean a bounty Its against
international convention and US Law to
offer a bounty for someones death sir

PAZZI
I mean in the case of say someone
who might not ordinarily be eligible to
accept a reward

VOICE
May I suggest you contact an attorney
sir before taking any possible-illegal
action Theres one in Geneva whos
excellent in these matters
May I recommend an attorney May I give
you his toll-free number

The voice enunciates the number clearly Pazzi writes it on
the back of his hand next to the other one the pen shaking

VOICE
Thank you for calling

The call disconnects Pazzi takes a breath Crosses the
street to another pay phone Dials the toll-free number and
pockets the coins The call connects Another male voice
This one with a dry Swiss lawyerly tone

VOICE 2
Hello -

PAZZI
Yes I was just speaking with someone
who suggested I -

VOICE 2

There is a one hundred thousand dollar
advance To qualify for the advance a
fingerprint must be provided - in situ -

INT CAFE RESTROOM - LATER - DAY

Pazzi scrubs at his hands like Lady Macbeth trying to get
the stain of the phone numbers off his skin the black ink
clouding the water pooling in the sink before going down
the drain

INT STARLINGS LECTEREUM - DAY

A security tape of mostly-Japanese customers entering and
exiting an exclusive Tokyo perfumery plays on Starlings VCR
The mail room boy watches it as Starling speaks on the phone -

STARLING
Is it possible it went out with the
regular mail

YOUNG AGENTS VOICE
No No I over-nighted it I filled
out the slip myself
INT QUESTURA - INTERCUT
Its the same young agent who copied the security tape -

YOUNG AGENT
This was the day after your request
I did it right away I dont understand
what happened You should have it

INT STARLINGS LECTEREUM -

There are three other tapes marked with the names of stores
in Paris Rome and Amsterdam stacked on top of the machine
that plays the Japanese perfumery

STARLING
I dont Can you send me another one

YOUNG AGENTS VOICE
Ill have to make another one

STARLING
Id appreciate it

She hangs up Geoffrey gestures to the monitor

GEOFFREY
Nothing huh

STARLING
Nothing yet Still waiting on Florence
and London London says theyre sniffing
around I dont know is that British
humor

EXT PALAZZO CAPPONI - DAY

Pazzis clean finger presses a button on the intercom set
into the stone wall of the entry As he waits he glances up
at the security camera then down at the hammered-iron handle

on the door No way to get a print off that

DR FELLS VOICE
Buongiorno

PAZZI
Dr Fell Its Inspector Pazzi

DR FELLS VOICE
Yes I can see

A buzzer releases the lock and Pazzi pulls the door open
INT PALAZZO CAPPONI - DAY

As Fell leads Pazzi across the main salon upstairs past
furniture draped with sheets the inspectors glance darts
from object to object hed like to steal for prints - a

glass

a book a vase a pen

DR FELL
I shouldve encouraged you to bring
someone along The cases Im afraid
are on the heavy side

PAZZI
Maybe you could help me with them

DR FELL
Hmmmm

PAZZI
Just down the stairs I mean

They reach two big suitcases closed Two typewritten sheets
of paper rest on a small table next to them

PAZZI
Is that the inventory

DR FELL
Yes

PAZZI
May I see it

DR FELL
Of course

Pazzi waits for Fell to hand it to him Unfortunately its
just as close to him Once its clear Fell has no intention
of picking it up Pazzi does - carefully but not too
carefully - and pretends to read it

DR FELL
You are a Pazzi of the Pazzi I think
(Pazzi doesnt answer)

Wasnt it at the Palazzo Vecchio your
ancestor was hanged Francesco dePazzi
Thrown naked with a noose around his neck
from the window Writhing alongside the
archbishop against the cold stone wall

Pazzi stares at Fell who only pleasantly smiles back

DR FELL
I found a nice rendering of it here in
the library the other day If youd like
perhaps I could sneak it out for you

PAZZI
Id think that might jeopardize your
chances for permanent appointment to the
curatorship
DR FELL
Only if you told
(Fell smiles again)

Remind me What was his crime
PAZZI
He was accused of killing Giuliano
deMedici
DR FELL
Unjustly
PAZZI

No I dont think so

DR FELL
Then he wasnt just accused He did it
He was guilty

A knowing look from Fell makes Pazzi wonder if he somehow
knows he knows hes Lecter

DR FELL
Id think that would make living in
Florence with the name Pazzi
uncomfortable even 500 years later

PAZZI

Not really In fact I cant remember
the last time - before today - someone
brought it up

DR FELL
But people dont always tell you what
theyre thinking They just see to it
you dont advance

(then)

Im sorry I too often say what Im
thinking Ill be right back to help
you

Fell leaves Pazzi alone in the room

FELLS VOICE
Any developments in the Il Mostro case

PAZZI
I believe my colleagues are checking
suspects homes to see if they have any
Botticelli prints

FELLS VOICE
In their homes That would be rather

obvious wouldnt it

PAZZI
Serial killers are obvious Their
primary motivation is to be obvious to
be noticed

FELLS VOICE
But not caught

In another room Fell opens a drawer and takes out a pair of
leather gloves

PAZZIS VOICE
Yes that too I think

DR FELL
Not really

PAZZIS VOICE
Yes

FELLS VOICE
Hmmm

In the salon Pazzi peers closely at the handles of the
suitcases to see if he can tell which if either has the
better print It doesnt matter really in a few moments
hell get another fresh one

FELLS VOICE
By the way the room youre standing in was
built in the 15th-century

PAZZI
Its beautiful

FELLS VOICE
Yes Unfortunately I think the heating
system was installed just about the same
time

Fell reappears pulling on the gloves Elaborating a shiver
he rubs them together

FELL
All right lets drag these things down
Theyre as heavy as bodies

INTEXT PERFUMERY - DAY

From across the street Pazzi watches Fell inside the small
shop browsing at the glass bottles that line the shelves his
ungloved hands clasped behind his back like someone looking
at great art his nose taking in the cacophony of scents

The hands unclasp A finger reaches to a bottle - but
doesnt touch it - moving slowly back and forth an inch away
from the label as a reading aid The hands return then to
their clasped position behind the back
EXT CAFE - LATER

Fell alone at a table his hand grasping a wine glass
firmly bringing it to his lips and setting it back down
Pazzi watching from across the street smiles until
Fell takes a last sip touches a napkin to his lips slides
the cloth across the glass in a single mechanical motion
gets up and leaves

INT JEWELRY STORE - DAY

Pazzis hands peel tens of thousands of lira from his money
clip as a jewelers hands rub a soft cloth at the blank face
of a silver ID bracelet

JEWELER
What would you like engraved on it sir

PAZZI
Nothing

JEWELER
May I apply an anti-tarnish coating

PAZZI
No

EXT ROAD TO PRATO - DAY
Sollicciano the dreaded Florentine jail
INT JAIL - WOMENS DIVISION - DAY

A young womans eyes drift down from Pazzis tie clasp to
his wedding band to his silver ID bracelet In a crowd on
the street she could remove all three in an instant and he
wouldnt even notice they were gone until he got home

ROMULA
What do you want Information

PAZZI
What sort of information would you be
willing to give me Romula Names and
descriptions of fifteen Gypsy pickpockets
who never existed No what I want is to
get you out of here And to make your
arrest record permanently disappear In
exchange all I want from you is the
usual thing Only I want you to fail

EXT FELLS RESIDENCE - DAY

Fell emerges from his residence with a cloth shopping bag
As he walks away on the cobblestoned street a Vespa - with
Pazzi driving and Romula holding him around the waist - races
past and disappears into the traffic
EXT VERA DAL 1926 - LATER

Pazzi and Romula on the parked scooter watch Fell inside
the exclusive food shop selecting figs and white truffles

PAZZI
When you fumble for his wallet hell
catch you by the wrist -

ROMULA
Ive done this a few times Inspector -

PAZZI
Not like this If there isnt a clean
print on that bracelet -
(on her wrist now)
- its back to Sollicciano

ROMULA
If theres a problem and someone helps
dont hurt him
My friend doesnt know anything and
wont take anything let him run off

PAZZI
There wont be a problem The man cant
afford a problem Hell want to get away
from you more than you will from him

Here he comes out the door of the shop the little bell
above it tinkling Pazzi waits a moment then starts the
Vespa puts it in gear As he blends in among cars racing
past Fell the sound of a choir practicing - somewhere -
begins and carries over

INT CHURCH OF SAN CROCE - LATER

Tourists drop 200-lira pieces into coin boxes that trigger
light to be thrown across the great frescos of Christ The
clicking timers wind down after only a few moments and the
murals plunge back into incense-smoky darkness

Pazzi lurking in the vast cathedral by Galileos grave
points with his chin to a transept to the left of the main
altar There Romula can see the kneeling shape of a lone
figure and the outline of his shopping bag

Fell has brought along his art supplies and uses some now

to carefully make a charcoal rubbing of an inscription in the
stone To keep his hands clean he wears a pair of thin
cotton gloves

A bell sounds Midday closing Sextons coming out with
their keys to empty the coin boxes Tourists looking around
puzzled in the dark not yet understanding they all have to
leave Pazzi watches Fell rise from his labors carefully
place the charcoal rubbing in his shopping bag and pull the
gloves off

PAZZI
(a whisper)
Okay

She nods moves away to the entrance of the church The
crowd will force Fell to pass right by her here Troubled by
something though - a feeling - she looks down Sees shes
standing on the tomb of Michelangelo Steps off and whispers
to the slab -

ROMULA
Sorry

Fell is coming toward her in the dark oblivious to what is
about to happen Someone reaches into a purse and fishes out
a 200-lira coin

Romula begins to move toward the dark shape moving toward
her Her friend and protector Gnocco falls in a couple
steps behind her A hand drops the coin ina slot

Just as Romula and her target are upon one another a light
goes on illuminating a fresco of a bloodied Christ and Fells
eyes looking straight into hers and chilling her heart The
ticking of the coin box accompanies an awkward moment before
Romula manages -

ROMULA
Excuse me

She continues past Fell the bracelet - untouched - jangling
dully on her wrist Fell looks back over his shoulder at the
woman She looks back over hers for a second and the light
goes out leaving him in silhouette

Fell walks away out past the doors and into the blinding
sunlight Pazzi wanders around in the dark and finally finds
Romula at a font scrubbing her hands in the holy water

ROMULA
Thats the Devil

She takes the bracelet off and hands it to Pazzi He watches
water drip from it and his hands to the floor

PAZZI
So Ill drive you back to jail then

ROMULA
Yes

She splashes holy water on her face Pazzi shakes his head
and glances away watches absently as a sexton empties one of
the coin boxes then notices Gnocco standing in the shadows
EXT PIAZZA SANTO SPIRITO - NIGHT

The dark water of the Arno drifts slowly under a bridge On

the left bank by the fountain Gnocco and some other Gypsies
share a joint In between hits Gnocco slices up an orange

his eyes hazy but his hand quick with the blade the juice of
the fruit dripping onto his fingers

GNOCCO
Two million lire

PAZZI
Fine

GNOCCO
Give me the bracelet

PAZZI
Wash your fuckin hands

EXT VIA SAN LEONARDO - NIGHT

Steep cobbled ill-lit street Gnocco leaning in a dark
gated niche built into a high stone wall protecting villas
inside He finishes a joint tosses it away Spits on the
bracelet and wipes it clean with the tail of his shirt As
hes about to put it on his wrist his jacket vibrates With
his free hand he removes a cell phone from the pocket

PAZZIS VOICE
Hes coming

The call disconnects Gnocco slips the phone back into the
pocket clasps the bracelet around his wrist and steps out of
the shadows

Several people appear around the corner all of them well-
dressed A show must have just let out Gnocco walks up the
narrow street toward the column of advancing bobbing heads
keeping his eyes on one of them Fell

Gnocco and the group are upon each other Stoned and
swimming against the current the pickpocket angles toward
his mark bumps into him reaches inside the elegant coat
feels the wrist with the bracelet seized in a terrific grip
twists it free hardly breaking stride and emerges from

the tail of the throng

He veers into another dark niche and bends over slightly
to catch his breath In a moment quick footsteps announce
Pazzis arrival

GNOCCO
I got it He grabbed me just right
Tried to hit me in the balls but he
missed

He holds out the arm with the braclet for Pazzi to take it
off As the Inspector works carefully at the clasp Gnocco
sucks in another deep breath of air

GNOCCO
Jesus -

PAZZI
What -

Gnocco suddenly collapses to one knee the bracelet pulling
from Pazzis hands Blood begins to gush out of a neat tear
in his pants

More confuses than in pain Gnocco looks down at the blood
only to have it spray up into his face Trying to ignore the
blood - even as it sprays on him - Pazzi works to get the
bracelet off and finally frees it

Gnocco stares dumbly at himself in his praying position
then tries to stop the flow of blood with his hand As he
collapses against the iron gate Pazzi sets the bracelet in
the box it came in pockets it then reaches into Gnoccos
bloody pocket and takes the phone

PAZZI
Here let me help you

Gnocco looks up at Pazzi gratefully feels his hand being
moved away from the wound and held feels nothing pressed in
its place feels his blood drainging out of his body then
feels nothing Hes dead

Pazzi gets up Takes out a handkerchief Wrapped inside is
a used syringe He tosses it on the ground and walks away

INT VERGERS CHAMBER - DAY

Verger lying in the dark watches a technician in a pool
of bright light in the sitting area using a cordless power
screwdriver to back out the screws that secure the bracelet
to the jewelers stand Carefully he lifts it out of the
velvet box and sets it on a china plate

A few flecks of dried blood fall onto the porcelain More
dried blood encrusts the silver He dusts the bracelet with
Dragons Blood powder angles a hot lamp at it and
photographs the one - in situ - print

He comes around the tripod then and lifts the print tapes it
to a slide and compares it to Lecters FBI print card under a
microscope The swirling lines come into sharp focus

TECHNICIAN

EXT SARDINIA - DAY

On a mountain farm deep in central Sardinia a young man
wheels an empty battered metal gurney along the fence-line
of a large pen

Inside the adjacent shed another young man picks through a
pile of old clothes In a corner a third young man shuffles
through a small handful of audio cassette tapes

Carlo and his gurney arrive His brother Matteo has chosen
an ensemble of pants and shirt and lays it out on the sheet
Carlos cell phone rings He flips it open

MASONS VOICE
Carlo

CARLO
Mason

MASONS VOICE
Ciao Bello Come stai You have all
your shots Theres a nasty winter flu
going around

CARLO
Am I coming to see you

MASONS VOICE
Soon I think but first I need you to
pack off the boys Yes I know the day
you never thought would arrive has
Got a pencil

Carlo grabs a pen and a scrap of paper from the trestle
table by the gurney where his brother is now filling the
clothes with meat and acorns and entrails and bread

MASONS VOICE
You need to get certified cholera
inoculations - well not you - and Ace-
promazine for sedation Thats a-c-e-p-r-
oh the hell with it youll find it
Cordell will fax the Veterinary Service
forms directly to Animal and Plant Health
- but you need to get the veterinary
affidavits from Sardinia

As Carlo scribbles the shipping instructions Piero decides
on a tape drops it in and carries the boom box outside

MASONS VOICE
The airbus will await you in Cagliari
Count Fleet Airlines The crates can be
no larger than four-by-six - its as bad
as carry-on rules An on-board inspector
has to travel with them Theyll be met
at Baltimore-Washington Airport - not the
Key West quarantine facility - by my
people who will clear them through
Customs Va bene

CARLO
Got it

MASONS VOICE
How are they

CARLO
Theyre really big Mason About two
hundred and seventy kilos

MASONS VOICE
Wow

Someone starts screaming outside a recorded male voice from
the boom box Matteo splashes some expensive cologne on the
stuffed clothes and wheels the gurney out

MASONS VOICE
Oh I called at a good time I can
hear that Would it be too much trouble
to take the phone outside

Carlo walks out to the pen with the phone Matteo is there
lowering the gurney while Piero raises the volume on the boom
box The recorded screams echo out across the mountains - a
fitting overture for the dark shadows coming out of the
woods

EXT BANK - GENEVA - DAY
The unassuming facade of Geneva Credit Suisse
INT CREDIT SUISSE VAULT - DAY

A bank clerk and another man both in business suits work
their keys to open four deep lock boxes with brass plates

INT ADJACENT PRIVACY ROOM - DAY

Alone in this severe scrubbed very Swiss room Pazzi can
hear the sound of wheels In a moment a cart with four large
metal deposit boxes is pushed in

The clerk excuses himself The other man raises the lids of
the boxes revealing three hundred banded blocks of non-
sequential hundred dollar bills

Pazzi watches the man tear the paper bands off ten of the
neat stacks and set the loose bills in a counting machine
The numbers on the LCD display climb
MR KONIE

The full balance of the money is
payable upon receipt of the doctor alive

(the same dry Swiss voice Pazzi

heard on the phone recording)
Of course you wont have to seize him
yourself but merely point him out to us
In fact its preferable to all concerned
if thats the extent of your involvement
from this point

PAZZI
I prefer to stay involved To make sure
things go right

MR KONIE
Professionals will see to that sir

PAZZI
Im a professional

The glowing LCD display stops at 100000

INT FLORENCE PERFUMERY - DAY

Flushed with the feeling that one of the bundles of money
makes against his thigh Pazzi enters the exlusive shop and

browses at the bottles of scents on the shelves

PERFUMER
May I help you sir

PAZZI
Yes Yes you may

INT PAZZIS APARTMENT - EVENING

An aria can be heard as Allegra Pazzi sitting at her
dressing table in her underclothes uncaps a small unlabeled
bottle of perfume and carefully touches a drop to her wrist

Across the bedroom knotting a new tie that drapes against a
handmade linen shirt that still shows the fold-creases Pazzi
watches as his wife lifts the wrist to her beautiful face
smells the scent on it and smiles to herself

Pazzi smiles too to himself as he watches her place
another drop on the other wrist and two more just under her
diamond-studded ear lobes

Its almost like watching sex

INT TEATRO MICHAHELLES - NIGHT

The aria fills the grand darkened interior of the theatre
In a private box overlooking the stage Pazzi sits with his
wifes hand in his - he in his new Sulka suit she in her new
evening gown The scalped tickets for these seats must have
cost him a fortune but then he can afford it now

A whiteness down below caught by the bounce of a stage
light draws Pazzis attention from the diva The bright
glow belongs to the starched French cuffs of a white dress
shirt poking out of dark sleeves the hands intertwined the
chin resting on them

Its Dr Fell engrossed in the drama lost in the harrowed
beauty of the prima donnas voice But then the head come
around like an owls the eyes peering up to the private box
Pazzi had a second of opportunity to look away but missed it
and now their eyes meet

Pazzi involuntarily squeezes his wifes hand The pressure

draws a loving look from her but Pazzis is still locked on
Fells enigmatic little smile much as he wishes it wasnt

until a crescendo in the music - finally - draws Fells

head and eyes back to the stage Applause

EXT TEATRO PICCOLOMINI - NIGHT
A crush of theatergoers maneuvers for cabs

DR FELL
Enjoy the performance Commendatore

Pazzi and his wife waiting for a free cab turn to see Fell
standing behind them He smiles pleasantly

PAZZI
Very much Allegra this is Dr Fell
Curator of the Capponi Library

DR FELL
Curator protempore Signora Pazzi Im
honored

Pazzis eyes follow Fells hand as it reaches to and holds
his wifes his wrist bowing slightly Allegra smiles at his
grace and the graceful tone of his voice

ALLEGRA
Is that an American accent doctor

DR FELL
Canadian wrung through the eastern sea-
board of America

ALLEGRA
Ive always wanted to visit New England
especially

DR FELL
Umm Its nice Ive enjoyed many
excellent meals there

Pazzi would very much enjoy leaving and looks away hoping to
see a driver interested in his patronage

DR FELL
Did I notice you following the score
Signora Hardly anyone does it anymore
Would this interest you

From a portfolio under his arm he produces a hand-copied
score on parchment - c 1688 - each page in a plastic sleeve

DR FELL
Ive marked in overlay some of the
differences from the modern score which
might amuse you Please take it

ALLEGRA
Look at this Rinaldo

PAZZI
I can see it

And both of their hands Fells and hers on it

ALLEGRA
I did have some trouble with the
recitative at the beginning

DR FELL
Dantes first sonnet from La Vita Nuova
He saw Beatrice Portinari across a chapel
and he loved her at that instant and for
the rest of his life But then had a
disturbing dream -

ALLEGRA
(reading from text)
Joyous Love seemed to me the while
he held my heart in his hands and in his
arms My lady lay asleep wrapped in a
veil -

DR FELL
(continuing from memory)
He woke her then and trembling and
obedient she ate that burning heart out
of his hand Weeping I saw him then
depart from me

ALLEGRA
He saw her eat his heart
(Fell likes that as much as
she does)
Do you believe a man could become
so obsessed with a woman from a single
encounter

DR FELL
Could he daily feel a stab of hunger
for her Find nourishment in the very
sight of her JI think so But would
she see through the bars of his plight
and ache for him

Allegra waits for the answer but Fell doesnt have it he
just looks away wistfully as his fingers slide away from the
plastic like snakes

ALLEGRA
Thank you for this

Fells nod says Im your servant Pazzi pulls open the back
door of a cab

DR FELL
Commendatore
(as he shakes Pazzis hand)
A lle gra

Its all Pazzi can do to keep from arresting the man as he
watches Fell rape his wife with a kiss of her hand His head
stays down there longer than it should as he savors the aroma
emanating from her wrist Finally the head rises back up and
Pazzi all but shoves Allegra into the cab As Fell watches
after it driving away a couple passes behind them

THEATERGOER
Lets get something to eat

DR FELL
(to himself)
Yes quite

The hand that held Allegras when he kissed it comes up to
his face He takes in the residue of the scent

INT STARLINGS HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Empty coffee cup and dinner debris on Starlings desk
Sitting at her computer she types in a code summoning the
FBIs private VICAP site Navigating deep into it with other
codes she reaches a page with a query panel and types in -
cookies

The screen fills with long lines of text - words and numbers
and slashes and hyphens - the fingerprints left by everyone
who has accessed the site over the last year

Most have addresses within the FBI itself and Justice
Department the majority of the rest from Interpol and other
internationl police organizations The scrolling list goes
on forever
She narrows her search to show only those who have visited
the VICAP Lecter files then narrows it further to those who
have knocked more than twenty times in the last month

Her own screen name - cstarling - appears on the new list
more than any other There are also several flagged hits by
pkrendler She smiles at one name - jcrawford He isnt

supposed to be accessing the VICAP files anymore now that
hes retired but just cant help himself

The next heaviest user is a name she doesnt recognize
Someone who calls him or herself pfrancesco She stares
long at the screen name and finally whispers to it -

STARLING
Could that be you Doctor

EXT CEMETERY - FLORENCE - NIGHT

We slowly approach - from someones moving point of view -

a pair of young lovers walking toward us under the trees As
they draw closer - oblivious to us and our breath and our
footsteps on the cobblestone path -

Pazzi enters his own POV Once past the lovers he takes
out a pencil-thin Maglite and rakes its narrow beam across
names on the chipped-marble tombstones he passes the light
settling eventually on someone called Lorenzo Mametti

He tosses a cheap bunch of wilting flowers onto the grave
and looks around for whoever it is hes supposed to be meet-
ing here A shadowy figure emerges almost soundlessly from
behind a crypt and Pazzi finds the face with his pen light

CARLO
Please

Pazzi snaps it off Carlo comes out into the open looking
like a grave digger in his work clothes perches on a squat
headstone and first offering one to Pazzi who declines
lights himself a cigarette

CARLO
I want him in the open street with not

a lot of people around

PAZZI
How will you take him down

CARLO
Thats my business

PAZZI
Its my business too

CARLO
Youre a cop arent you

PAZZI
I asked you a question

CARLO
Yeah youre a cop all right Ill stun
him with a beanbag gun net him give him
a shot

PAZZI
He has to lecture tomorrow night It
wont be strange if I attend he actually
thinks Im interested Can you do it
that soon

CARLO
Will you walk with him or are you afraid
of him

PAZZI

Ill do what Im paid to do and so will
you only Ill be better paid for it

Carlo removes his hat and bows his head as if to pray
Someone is walking on a path intersecting theirs down by the
mausoleums The figure disappears behind the stone walls

PAZZI
I want him out of Tuscany fast

CARLO
Believe me hell be gone from the face
of the earth fast Feet first

INT STARLINGS LECTEREUM - DAY

Starling glances from an international number jotted down on
her blotter to the phone on which shes dialing it A paused
time-coded frame of Lecter at the Florence perfumery taking
in a scent on his hand glows on her television as she
listens to a European ring

INT QUESTURA - SAME TIME - EVENING

Pictures of Il Mostros victims stare at the detective who
picks up the ringing phone

DETECTIVE
Questura Pandolfini

STARLINGS VOICE
Id like to speak with Chief Inspector
Rinaldo Pazzi please Im Agent Clarice
Starling with the American FBI

The detective puts her on hold and shouts Pazzi across
the room to where Pazzi was just grabbing his coat off the
rack to leave He holds the receiver up then cradles it
Pazzi groans Keeps his coat on Lifts the receiver of
another phone near him and pushes the blinking light

PAZZI
Pazzi

STARLINGS VOICE
Inspector Pazzi its Agent Starling with
the FBI How do you do

He was doing fine until this instant
INTERCUT him here and Starling in her basement room -

PAZZI
Actually I was just leaving for the day
can I call you back tomorrow

STARLING
This wont take long Id appreciate it

Pazzi groans again to himself as he glances to the clock

STARLING
I wanted to thank you first of all
for sending me the security tape from the
perfume store

The security tape Pazzi thought he buried that tape

STARLING
When I say you I mean your department
Agent Benetti Is he there Can I speak
with him

Pazzi is looking right at the young man pouring himself a cup
of water at the dispenser

PAZZI
Im sorry hes gone home

STARLING
Thats all right I should tell you this
rather than him anyway -

PAZZI
Im late for an important lec - an
important appointment -

STARLING
The person Im looking for Inspector -
who was indeed shown on that tape - is
Hannibal Lecter

PAZZI
Who

STARLING

Dr Hannibal Lecter Youve never heard
of him Hes quite well-known at least

in America

PAZZI
Im sorry Im not familiar -

STARLING

And the tape confirms that he is - or was

recently - in Florence

PAZZI
Really

STARLING
Hes a very dangerous man Inspector

Pazzi Hes killed nine people - that we

know of

PAZZI

We know about dangerous men around here

too unfortunately

STARLING
Il Mostro

PAZZI
Yes
(pause)
You dont think -

STARLING
No I dont The crimes of Il Mostro
bear no resemblance to Lecters in
style

PAZZI
I really have to go Miss -

STARLING
Starling Just another minute Are
you sure youve never heard of him

PAZZI
I havent -

STARLING
Because Im confused Im confused
by that because someone there has been

in

accessing our private VICAP files on Dr

Lecter with some regularity on your
computer

PAZZI
Everybody uses everybodys computer here
Maybe one of the detectives on Il Mostro
was looking at profiles of killers to -

STARLING
Im speaking about the computer at your
home sir

Silence on both ends of the line A printout on her desk
shows the Internet trail Scribbled on a Post-It stuck to it
is pfrancesco rinaldo pazzi

STARLING
Youre trying to catch him yourself
arent you Inspector For the reward
I cannot warn you strongly enough against
that He killed three policemen down in
Memphis while he was in custody tearing
the face off one of them - and he will
kill you too if you -

He hangs up on her
INTEXT PALAZZO VECCHIO - LATER - EVENING

As the sky darkens floodlights across the piazza blink on
and wash across the rough stone walls of the Palazzo Vecchio
As bats fly out from the jack-o-lantern teeth of the
parapets the image suddenly goes to -

BLACK AND WHITE - a security monitor in the foyer on which
a guard watches the creatures circling the building looking
for darker quarters

A clunking sound draws our attention but not his to the
stairs where we briefly glimpse the bottom half of a hand
truck - with something big strapped to it - as its pulled
with some effort up the top steps

UPPER HALL

The hand truck is wheeling toward us now along the long
hall and we see that it is a lectern - as big as a pulpit -
strapped to it We watch it coming and the worker pushing
it - that same man again the Palazzos custodian - into -

THE SALON OF LILIES

- where the restorers are climbing down from their
scaffolding closing up their cans of spirits and paints
packing up to leave for the day

Metal folding chairs have been arranged on the drop cloths
covering the floor in split rows of six Fell is at a small
table in back of them setting up a slide projector He
turns it on and angle its bright white light onto a home
movie screen draping off the arm of its metal stand
He sees the custodian coming in with the hand truck and
points out to him that hed like the lectern up front to one
side of the screen

The screen Its too small The projector light spilling
way wide of its edges The drop cloth hanging from the
scaffolding behind it would work much better

As the custodian unstraps and sets up the lectern Fell takes
down the little screen sets it aside and stands before the
cloth smoothing at its flickering folds

The last of the restorers straggles out The custodian
unplugs and coils the long orange cord of the floor polisher
hand-over-elbow Fell adds a brown extension cord to the
projector remote and snakes it along the ersatz aisle between
the chairs to the lectern

He sets some books on the podium places his hands on its
sides to test the comfort of its height - its satisfactory -
and looks out over his invisible audience

The custodian is finished straightening up Fell watches

him cross behind the back row of folding chairs approach the
open doorway and pauses for a few moments - too many moments
to gaze up at the Botticelli before leaving

EXT PALAZZO VECCHIO - NIGHT

A great shadow rears up against the floodlit wall It
belongs to Pazzi as he crossed the piazza glancing once to
Carlo and his brother Matteo smoking next to a van before
disappearing into the palazzos front entrance

FELLS VOICE
Avarice and hanging are linked in the
medieval mind -

INT SALON OF LILIES - NIGHT

The dragons of the Studiolo - and Sogliato - face us in the
folding chairs listening to the lecture -

FELLS VOICE
St Jerome writes that Judas very
surname - Iscariot - means money or
price
A ringing phone interrupts The heads all turn Pazzi
standing just inside the doors gropes for his cell phone

extracts it from his jacket pocket

FELL
Ah Commendatore Pazzi

STARLINGS VOICE
It wasnt easy but I got this number
without telling them why Inspector Paz -

He hangs up on her Switches off the phones power

PAZZI
Sorry

FELL
Not al all Welcome Since you are
closest to the lights would you be so
kind as to dim the lights

Pazzi twists a dimmer on the wall and the lights come down

FELL
Thank you Youll be interested in
this Commendatore since there is a
Pazzi already in Dantes Inferno

An art slide appears on the drop cloth Fell improves the
focus with the remote

FELL

Here is the earliest known depiction
of the Crucifixion carved on an ivory
box in Gaul about AD Four Hundred It
includes the death by hanging of Judas
his face upturned to the branch that
suspends him

(the slide changes)
And here he is on the doors of the
Benevento Cathedral hanging with his
bowels falling out as St Luke the
physician described him in the Acts of
the Apostles - still looking up

The shadow of a bat flies across the image but everyone so
accustomed to the occurence ignores it

FELL
In this plate from a fifteenth-
century edition of the Inferno Pier
della Vignas body hangs from a bleeding
tree I will not belabor the obvious
parallel with Judas Iscariot

Pazzi still in the back of the room tries desperately to
separate the legs of a folding chair without having them
squeak

FELL
But Dante Alighieri needed no drawn
illustration It is his genius to make
Pier della Vigna now in Hell speak in
strained hisses and coughing sibilants as
though he is hanging still Listen as he
drags with the other damned his own dead
body to hang upon the thorn tree

Fells normally composed face pains as he recites from memory
Dantes words of the agonal Pier della Vigna -

FELL
Come laltre verrem per nostre spoglie
ma no pero chalcuna sen rivesta che non
e giusto aver cio chom si toglie
Qui le strascineremo e per la mesta
selva saranno i nostri corpi appesi
ciascuno al prun de lombra sua molesta

A single metallic squeak from the back of the room punctuates
the last word

FELL
Avarice hanging self-destruction
with avarice counting as self-destruction
as much as hanging And what does the
anonymous Florentine suicide say in his
torment at the end of the canto
(pained)
Io fei gibetto a me de le mie case
I - I make my own house be my gallows
(pause)
Thank you for your kind attention

Now there are gratefully a lot of chair squeaks as the
scholars stand to applaud Fell and come around him to shake
his hand Pazzi has to step aside to keep from being knocked
over by Sogliato leaving

The lights stay dimmed Pazzi makes his way to Fell and
waits as an autograph-seeker waits for the last of the fans
to shake the doctors hand and step away

PAZZI
Im not a scholar but I think youve

got the job Can I buy you a celebratory
drink

FELL

How kind of you Yes Id like that
Ill just be a minute gathering my
things

As Fell takes his tomes from the lectern and carries them
back to the projector table Pazzi switches the power back on
his cell phone Nothing happens He realizes he has pressed
the ringvibrate not the power button powers it up now and
makes a call

PAZZI
Allegra cara Ill be home just a
little later than I said Im taking Dr
Fell out for a drink
INTERCUT Carlo outside watching the entry of the Palazzo

CARLO
I can see the people coming out now

Back in the Salon Pazzi hangs up Fell gathers his slides

FELL
Oh I shouldve shown them this one
I cant imagine how I missed it This
one will interest you

He drops the slide in front of the projector bulb and the
image appears on the drop cloth a drawing of a man hanging
naked beneath the battlements of this palace the Palazzo
Vecchio from the exact same angle we saw on the security
monitor

FELL
Can you make it out all right

Its a little blurry but Fell works with the remote and the
illustration passes back and forth across the plane of focus
Keeping the remote in one hand he takes a rag from his
satchel with the other and approaches Pazzi his silhouette
against on the drop cloth looming large as he comes

FELL
Theres a name down here can you see it

Pazzi comes close to look The projectors focusing motor
purrs as Fell works it with the remote The lettering
sharpens Francesco Pazzi Cheerfully -

FELL
Its your ancestor Commendatore
Hanging beneath these very windows On
a related subject I must confess to you
Im giving serious thought to eating
your wife

He pulls at the heavy drop cloth It comes down
enveloping Pazzi Fell seizes him around the chest and
presses the ether-soaked rag over the canvas where Pazzis
face must be - the image of his hanging ancestor splashed
across the wall under the scaffolding

EXT PALAZZO VECCHIO - NIGHT

At the back of the van its doors open Carlo unzips a black
vinyl guitar gig-bag Inside is his beanbag stun rifle He
sets it next to the case and leans past the side of the door
to check on his brother Matteo stationed across the piazza
at the far end of the palazzo
From Matteos position - if he were looking - he could
see that his brother Carlo would like him to pay attention

Matteo is paying attention only its to a young couple in a
car parked in the shadows across the street necking

A rock hits Matteos pant leg and he finally looks up to his
brother by the van who is saying with the arm that threw the
rock Whats the matter with you

Neither one of them pays any attention to the worker sitting
on the ledge of the fountain - the custodian from the Palazzo
Vecchio - who glances up from time to time from the tip of
his burning cigarette to the young lovers in the car

INT SALON OF LILIES - NIGHT

Pazzis gun his plastic handcuffs strips and his wallet sit
next to Fells work permit and permesso di soggiorno on the
podium

Fell himself is standing next to it working the plug-end

of the long orange floor polisher cord into a hangmans noose
with the traditional thirteen wraps Finishing he crosses
the room with it the tail of the orange snake uncurling and
slithering after him

FELL
If you tell me what I need to know
Commendatore it would be convenient for
me to leave without my meal Ill ask
you questions and then well see

Pazzi is cinched to the hand truck with the same canvas
straps used to secure the lecturn on its journey up to the
salon With his mouth taped its difficult for him to
express his gratitude

FELL
Was it Mason Verger you sold me to
Blink twice for yes Yes Thank you
Are his men waiting outside Umm hmmm
And one of them smells like tainted boar
sausage Was that a single blink Oh
now youre confused Try not to be
confused or I may have to fillet Signora
Pazzi after all Have you told anyone in
the Questura about me No I thought
not Have you told A-lle-gra No
Youre sure I believe you

Fell comes around behind Pazzi to the back of the hand truck
hooks the cord-noose around one of its handles and gently
tips it back

FELL
Here we go Hold on
Pazzi struggles against the straps He struggles to speak
to beg but all that comes past the tape over his mouth is a
purr Fell wheels him close to a balcony fully uprights the
hand truck again takes the noose from the handle drapes it
delicately around Pazzis neck and tightens the slack

FELL
Your heart is palpitating I can see it

Pazzis heart is beating so hard the fabric of his jacket is
fluttering

FELL
No Thats not your heart

Fell slips a hand under the taut lapel as if to extract
Pazzis heart Instead he finds in there the cell phone
It vibrates silently in Fells hand

FELL
Who could that be Should I answer it

Why not Fell flips it open

FELL
(brightly)
Pronto

STARLINGS VOICE
Ive gone above you Inspector Ive
spoken to your section chief Someday
youll thank me - or you wont - I
dont care - youll be alive
(silence)
Inspector Pazzi

LECTER
Im afraid I have bad news Clarice

INT STARLINGS LECTEREUM - SAME TIME

Dead silence except for a low rumble from the boiler room
Starling at her desk like a statue clutching a phone
Finally -

STARLING
Is he dead

LECTERS VOICE
You got my note I hope you liked the
hand cream I had it made especially for
you

STARLING
Is he dead Dr Lecter
LECTERS VOICE
Clarice theres nothing Id love
more in the world than to chat with you
Unfortunately youve caught me at an
awkward moment Forgive me

INT SALON OF LILIES -

Lecter closes up the phone Switches off the power Returns
it to Pazzis breast pocket

LECTER
An old friend

He glances off with the faintest hint of wistfulness The
wall behind the scaffolding is still displaying the slide of
the hanging Francesco Pazzi Fell looks back to his great-
great-great-great-great-cousin

LECTER
What do you think Bowels in Or out
like Cousin Francesco

Pazzis eyes blink and blink and blink and blink in terror

LECTER
Oh now you are confused Ill decide
for you if youll permit me

Flash of a knife as it comes up Pazzis front Another

swipe as it severs his attachment to the dolly One push and
the railing catches Pazzi at the waist He goes over it the
orange cord trailing the ground coming up in a rush the
floor polisher yanked down and sliding across the floor
gathering up the drop cloth and slamming against the railing
Pazzis neck snaps and his bowels and phone spill out

EXT PALAZZO VECCHIO - NIGHT

The lovers in the car break their embrace at the sound of the
phone clattering to the ground and stare up into the face of
the palazzo custodian - Il Mostro - standing just outside the
windshield with a big knife in his hand He runs

Carlo is running too from the the van toward the palazzo
yelling to his brother -

CARLO
Cover the back If he comes out just
kill him cut him

Matteo hurries around back Carlo jumps the steps three at
a time to the front doors as the security guard comes out to
see the thing in color that he couldnt quite make out in
black and white on his monitor

INT SALON OF LILIES - NIGHT
The great doors of the salon stand ajar Carlo swings his
gun around them onto the projected illustration of the
hanging figure on the wall

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

Matteo knife out stands before the back door of the
palazzo Breathing hard he reaches slowly for the handle
careful to position himself in a way that will allow the door
to act as his shield if it opens He grasps the handle and
pulls Its locked As the hand is letting go and coming
away the door suddenly swings open hard into his face -

INT SALON OF LILIES - NIGHT

Carlo hears the cry coming from the rear of the building
He runs from the salon and down the back stairs stumbling
down them catching himself reaching the back door thats
standing open

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

He emerges from the doorway leading with his gun sees his
brother on the ground covered in blood hurries to him and
kneels Matteos dead

EXT PIAZZA VECCHIO - NIGHT

A crowd is gathering peering up at the spectacle that is
Rinaldo Pazzi swaying slowly back and forth against the stone
walls lit up as if in a stadium under the floodlights

A motorcycle comes toward the square on a narrow side street
A figure steps out into the glare of its headlight The
cyclist slows to a stop

LECTER
Young man if Im not at the Piazza
Bellosquardo in ten minutes my wife will
kill me

Lecters gloved hand offers a 50000-lira note

MOTORCYCLIST
Thats all you want A ride

LECTER
Thats all

He hands the cyclist the bill and climbs on back careful not
to touch the young man with his hands lest he get the wrong
idea The Moto-Guzzi turns around and speeds off the way it
came away from the piazza

FADE TO BLACK
And out of the black materializes -

A BLACK AND WHITE image of Pazzi small and stark in the
floodlights swinging against the wall of the Palazzo
Vecchio

INT STARLINGS LECTEREUM - DAY

The event captured on tape by the security camera across the
piazza copied and sent by the Questura at her request plays
on Starlings VCR setup As she watches it -

INT VERGERS CHAMBER - DAY

A copy of a copy of the tape - at the same point in the
action - plays for Verger Noticing something - some move-
ment in an upper corner of the frame - he reverse-searches
the tape with his remote to look at it again

The movement belongs to a silhouette of a figure appearing
briefly on the balcony above the hanged Pazzi An arm of the
figure rises up and the hand waves - not down to Pazzi - but
across to the viewer Verger freezes the image and studies
it for a long moment in silence Eventually -

MASON
Cordell To you Does that look like
a wave goodbye Or hello

INT STARLINGS LECTEREUM -

Starlings copy of the tape frozen on the same frame She
too reverse-searches it and plays the wave again no doubt
wondering the same thing Verger is Her phone rings

STARLING
Starling

CRAWFORDS VOICE
Dont tell anyone but Im sitting here
watching an mpeg off the VICAP of a man
swinging from a rope against a building
in Florence

STARLING
Its an electrical cord Mr Crawford
and you know you shouldnt be doing that

INT CRAWFORDS OFFICE - MIAMI - SAME TIME
The same image glows on Crawfords computer screen
CRAWFORD
Ummm I cant see it that clearly but I

can see his intestines hanging out And
the figure on the balcony waving
INT STARLINGS LECTEREUM -

She unpauses her better quaility tape and the wave plays
again

STARLING
If I was concerned -

CRAWFORDS VOICE
You should be concerned Where do you
think hell go now that youve disturbed
his comfortable life

STARLING
Not here Somewhere else he can live
without denying himself the things he
likes

CRAWFORDS VOICE
What does he like

STARLING
You know Good food good wine music
books -

CRAWFORDS VOICE
He likes you Starling Seven years
gone not a trace and he writes to you
You know what that means

STARLING
No

CRAWFORDS VOICE
The stalker who says he likes you is
far more dangerous than the one who says
he wants to kill you

EXT VERGERS FARM - DAY

The holes in the side of the livestock truck arent big
enough to see whats inside The guard at the main entrance
clipboard in hand jumps back when something bangs up against
the metal wall of the trailer To the driver -

GUARD
You have to turn around - or back down
- go half a mile up the frontage road to
a gate - then up the service road

As the truck begins to turn around the guard waves
Cordells car through Barney is in the passenger seat

INT VERGERS CHAMBER - DAY

A man with glasses and a dry comb-over sits staring into the
glare of Vergers bed-lights
DR DOEMLING
I dont understand what you think he can
offer

MASON
A second opinion doctor I know thats
anathema to those in your profession but
its not in mine

Cordell leads Barney into the darkened chamber

MASON
Speak of the devil Welcome Barney
Im Mason This is Dr Doemling who is
head of the Baylor University Psychology
Department He holds the Verger Chair

BARNEY
How do you do

Barney sets down a pink dessert box tied with stirng and
offers his hand to the doctor receiving back for his trouble
a limp shake Peering into the lights he can see beyond them
only the vague shape of the figure in the hospital bed

MASON
I see youve brought dessert Thats
very kind Cookies I might be able to
get a cookie down somehow So Barney -
is Barney your real name by the way

BARNEY
Yes

MASON
First of all Barney thank you for the
wealth of wonderful items youve provided
me from your personal Lecter treasure
trove Ive enjoyed them immensely

BARNEY
Thank you for outbidding everyone Is
Mason your real name

MASON
Oh yes Please sit Yes beside Dr
Doemling is fine Thats his real name
too There Good Now -

DR DOEMLING
Barney if I could ask what exactly is
your professional training

BARNEY
I have an LPN
DR DOEMLING
Youre a licensed practical nurse

BARNEY
Yes

DR DOEMLING
Good for you

MASON
Okay everybody has everybodys real
names and credentials now Except mine
Mine are well Im just very wealthy
arent I Okay Lets begin

DR DOEMLING
Barney while you were working at the
state hospital - I assume not as licensed
practical nurse -

BARNEY
- as an orderly -

DR DOEMLING
- as an orderly - you observed Clarice
Starling and Hannibal Lecter interacting

BARNEY
Interacting

DR DOEMLING
Talking to one another

BARNEY
Yes Yes it seemed to me they -

DR DOEMLING
I can see youre eager to justify your
consulting fee but why dont we start
with what you saw not what you thought
about what you saw

MASON
Barneys smart enough to give us his
opinion Barney give us your opinion of

what you saw What was it between them

BARNEY

Most of the time Dr Lecter didnt
respond at all to visitors he would
just for instance open his eyes long
enough to insult some academic who was
there to look him over

(he looks Doemling over)
With Starling though he answered her
questions She interested him She
intrigued him He thought she was
charming and amusing

MASON
Uh-huh

DR DOEMLING
You can judge what Hannibal Lecter found
amusing Just how do you go about that
Nurse Barney

BARNEY
By listening to him laugh Dr Dumling

DR DOEMLING
Doemling

BARNEY
Sometimes Dr Lecter and I would talk
when things got quiet enough About the
science courses I was taking and -

DR DOEMLING
Some kind of mail-order courses in
psychology

BARNEY
No sir I dont consider psychology a
science and neither did Dr Lecter

A small laugh from behind the lights

MASON
And about her You talked about her

BARNEY
I can just repeat what he told me about
her

MASON

Thats why youre here

BARNEY
He said things like how she was
charming the way a cub is charming a
small cub that will grow up to be a big
cat - one that you cant play with later
She had a cub-like earnestness he said

MASON
Does she still in your opinion Have
you seen her lately

BARNEY
Yes I have and no I dont think she
does That quality in her I think is
gone
MASON
So Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter
became friendly

BARNEY
Inside a kind of formal structure yes

MASON
And he was fond of her

BARNEY
Yes

MASON
Thank you Barney Thank you very
much for your candor And keep all those
wonderful products coming Cordell see
that Barney receives a real nice tip

DR DOEMLING
Goodbye Nurse Barney

BARNEY
(picking up the pink box)
Mr Verger -

MASON
The cookies Yes lets have one

BARNEY
Its not cookies

He opens the box Its the Lecter mask Verger stares long
at it in reverential silence Finally -

MASON
How much

BARNEY
Two hundred and fifty Thousand

MASON
Cut Barney a check Cordell Now

Barney sets the mask on the bed and leaves Verger hooks a
talon-like finger over the wire and holds on Eventually he
comes out of his reverie -

MASON
So what do you think doctor Does
Lecter want to fuck her or kill her or
eat her or what

DR DOEMLING
Probably all three though I wouldnt
want to predict in what order
MASON
Hmmm

DR DOEMLING
No matter how Barney might want to
romanticize it and try to make it Beauty
and the Beast Lecters object - as you
know from personal experience - is always
degradation and suffering He comes in
the guise of a mentor - as he did to you -
and her - but its distress that excites
him To draw him - if thats the goal -
she needs to be distressed If you want
to make her attractive to him let him
see her distressed Let the damage he
sees suggest the damage he could do

MASON
When the fox hears a rabbit scream he
comes running but not to help

EXT VIRGINIA STATE PARK - DAY

A rabbit on a path staring listening hears the footsteps
before we do and bounds away back into the woods Starling
appears a moment later running on the same dirt path through
the trees two or three miles into her five-mile run working
up a sweat

She hears footsteps before we do too and like a rabbit
bounds off the path Stopping just off it she bends to
catch her breath then picks up a dead branch

The footsteps and the panting close in She lets the first
running man go past but grabs the second one throws him to
the ground straddles him and pushes the branch against his
throat At once calm but firm -

STARLING
Dont say a word

She neednt warn him the young man seems too terrified to
speak Starling reaches behind his track suit pulls out his
-38 and keeping the branch tight against his neck lets the
other runner whos running back now know that she has his
friends gun To him again very calmly as he nears -

STARLING
Stop Catch your breath Take your
gun out very slowly with your left hand
set it on the ground and take five steps
away from it

The second young man does exactly as hes told Then -

STARLING
All right Who are you
2ND RUNNER
We work for Jack Crawford Were
supposed to keep an eye on you To keep
you safe from - you know - Hannibal the
Cannibal

STARLING
Show me

He knows what that means and shows her identification from
Crawfords private security firm

She gets up off the other one then tosses the branch away
and walks over to the gun resting on the fallen leaves She
picks it up

STARLING
Okay here it is I dont need you
looking after me Im not in any danger
If you talk to him before I do tell him
that

2ND RUNNER
Yes maam

She returns the guns to each of them first giving the one on
the ground a hand up

STARLING
Sorry if I hurt you

She leaves them continues on her run As the one she threw
to the ground dusts himself off the perspective changes to -

A VIEW THROUGH BINOCULARS
- of the two private security men off in the distance

They blur then as the binoculars are shifted Trees too
blur across the lenses The view overtakes Starling returns
and follows her focusing as she runs through the trees
staying on her until she disappears down a sloping path

Lecter lowers the small expensive field glasses Returns
them to their case slung over his shoulder Crosses the dirt
parking area to her mustang Peers inside and sees no
blinking red light on the dash

He takes out a slim jim Slips it down and across the
drivers side jamb tripping the lock He opens the door
and sits in the bucket seat a long moment before delicately
touching the ten and two oclock points on the leather-clad
steering wheel where her hands rest most often He leans
closer to smell her on the leather Then licks it

INT KRENDLERS DC TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
Krendler just back from a jog himself sweaty T-shirt and
headband sits with Cordell and reads a postcard from London
sheathed in plastic written in Lecters distinctive copper-
plate Finishing he looks up at a speaker phone -

KRENDLER
Im not sure I understand

MASONS VOICE
You dont have to understand Paul All
you have to understand is what its worth
to you

KRENDLER
No I dont understand why she didnt
turn this over shes such a - straight
arrow

INT VERGERS CHAMBER - SAME TIME

Looking at his speakerphone Verger sighs Maybe hes making
a terrible mistake Maybe Krendler is just too stupid to be
of any real use to him As if to a child -

MASON
She didnt turn it over because she
didnt receive it She didnt receive
it because it was never delivered to her
It was delivered to me for a nice
gratuity to a not-so-nice mail room boy

KRENDLERS VOICE
Oh Ohhh

The realization and Krendlers look of admiration that
follows it only make Verger worry more about his stupidity

MASON
So what do you think

KRENDLERS VOICE
I think youd have been better off if
you hadnt gotten her out of trouble in
the first place

MASON
Woulda shoulda coulda - I meant what
do you think of the money
INT KRENDLERS TOWNHOUSE -

KRENDLER
Five

MASONS VOICE
Well lets just toss it off like
five Lets say it with the respect it
deserves

KRENDLER
Five hundred thousand dollars

MASONS VOICE
Thats better but not much but dont
say it again Will it work

Krendler considers the forged postcard again Eventually -

KRENDLER
It wont be pretty

MASONS VOICE
What ever is

INT ASSISTANT DIRECTOR NOONANS OFFICE - DAY

Starling sits next to her boss Pearsall and across from
his boss Noonan Krendler too is there and a federal
marshal standing in a corner of the quiet room

NOONAN
Would you identify yourself please
for the record

STARLING
Special Agent Clarice Starling Is
there a record Director Noonan Id
like there to be since I have no idea
what this is about Do you mind if I
run a tape

She takes a little Nagra from her purse sets it on the desk
and turns it on

NOONAN
Tell her the charges

KRENDLER
Withholding evidence and obstruction of
justice

The marshal sets the postcard with the familiar-looking
copperplate in front of Starling Her eyes move quickly back
and forth across the lines of words She doesnt touch it

NOONAN
Like to comment On tape

STARLING
Yes I would Ive never seen this
before in my life

KRENDLER
How do you account for it being found in
your - office - your - basement

STARLING
Found by who

KRENDLER
By me

STARLING
I dont think you want me to answer that
Mr Krendler Let me ask you this What
possible reason might I have to withhold
it

KRENDLER
Perhaps because of the nature of its
content It reads like a - like a love
letter to me

As Krendler comes over and hovers over her shoulder its all
she can do to keep herself from slugging him

STARLING
Has it been tested for prints

NOONAN
No prints on it None on the last one

STARLING
Handwriting (analysis) -

KRENDLER
(before Noonan can answer)
Did you ever think Clarice why the
Philistines dont understand you Its
because youre the answer to Samsons
riddle You are the honey in the lion
Sounds like him to me

STARLING
Do you mean Mr Krendler like a
homosexual

KRENDLER
Like a nut with a crush

Noonan not a bad guy chooses his next words carefully -

NOONAN
Clarice Im placing you on
administrative leave until Document
Analysis tells me unequivocally a
mistakes been made In the meantime
youll remain eligible for insurance and
medical benefits
Please surrender your weapons and
identification to Agent Pearsall

Looking steadily at Krendler Starling takes out her 45

drops the clip into her hand shucks the round out of the

pistols chamber and sets it all down on the desk As she
places her ID next to it Pearsall asks her sadly -

PEARSALL
Backup sidearm

STARLING
Locked in my car

PEARSALL
Other tactical equipment

STARLING
Helmet and vest

NOONAN
(to the marshal)
Youll retrieve those when you escort
Miss Starling from the building

The marshal comes toward her

STARLING
I want to say something I think Im
entitled

NOONAN
Go ahead

STARLING

I think Mr Mason Verger is trying to
capture Dr Lecter himself for the
purpose of personal revenge I think Mr
Krendler is in collusion with him and
wants the FBIS effort against Dr Lecter
to work for Mr Verger I think Mr
Krendler is being paid to do this

KRENDLER
Its a good thing youre not sworn here
today

STARLING
Swear me You swear too

NOONAN

Starling If the evidence is lacking
youll be entitled to full reinstatement
without prejudice - if you dont do - or
say - something in the meantime that
would make that impossible

Starling just keeps staring at Krendler as she gathers her
Nagra and purse Finally she glances over to her boss and
friend Pearsall who mouths -

PEARSALL
Sorry Starling

She lets the marshal lead her from the room
INT DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Lecter clutching a shopping bag stands in the electronics
department before a wall of television sets all tuned to the
same channel local news a talking head with an inset of a
photograph of Starling

TALKING HEAD
- relieved of field duty pending an
internal investigation into the charges
Starling a 7-year vetern on the Bureau
began her career with an assignment to
interview lethal madman Hannibal Lecter -

LECTER
- Doctor -

SALES CLERK
May I help you sir

Lecter glances to the young sales clerk a teenager with a
name tag

LECTER
I was looking for some good steak knives
Toby but Im afraid I got distracted

SALES CLERK
Kitchenware right over there

LECTER
Thank you

The clerk walks away Lecter glances back to the TVs to see
that a black and white inset photograph of himself has been
added to the one of Starling

TALKING HEAD
- receiving information from him which
led to killer Jame Gumb and the release
of his hostage Catherine Martin daughter
of the former US Senator from
Tennessee

Lecter glances over to Toby who is busy pointing out to
a customer the features of various VCRs his back to the

screens Footage of Krendler appears on them -

KRENDLER ON TV
FBI and the Justice Department are
looking carefully into the charges and
yes they are serious But I want to say
this Starlings one of the best agents
we have and having known her for a number
of years now I would be very surprised
if the accusations turn out to be true
Its much too soon to condemn her

Lecter smiles at Krendlers image He always smiles upon
finding himself in the presence of bad liars

INT STARLINGS HOUSE - NIGHT

Silent Still Then the lock turning in the front door

It opens Starling looking weary carries in a cardboard
box her things from her desk at the office no bigger than
Brighams was As she passes us -

Later Laundry room Absently dropping clothes in a
washing machine filling with water she then slides down to
the floor in despair her back against the warm enamel -

Later Living room Pouring herself a neat Jack Daniels
to the accompaniment of the first message on her answering
machine the voice sounding almost as tired as her -

CRAWFORDS VOICE
Hey Its Jack How you doing Im
sure its not as bad as it looks I feel
its my fault I got you into all this
Call me Make me feel better

She carries the drink to the sofa lies down hasnt bothered
to turn off any lights Drinks as the second message plays -

(in a firmer tone)

Tight on Starlings cassette deck - the spindles turning
the tape inside Stack of other tapes she got from Barney

lying next to it

LECTERS VOICE
Do you know what a roller pigeon is
Barney

Starling is asleep on the sofa now Still in her clothes

LECTERS VOICE
They climb high and fast then roll
over and fall just as fast toward the
earth There are shallow rollers and
deep rollers You cant breed two deep
rollers or their young will roll all the
down hit and die Officer Starling is
a deep roller Barney We should hope
one of her parents was not

The tape reaches its leader an stops The green power
light stays on Then it goes off then comes back on again
an electrical interruption that is quickly reestablished

INT BASEMENT - STARLINGS HOUSE - SAME TIME

A basement window slightly open A piece of insulated wire
clipped to the alarm contacts A shadow of a figure floating
away from it

The figure moves toward the stairs passing a rusty bicycle
hanging on the wall and some shooting trophies gathering dust
on a shelf and begins up the stairs

INT STARLINGS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The microwave ovens glowing reset numbers 8888 are
obsured a moment as the figure soundlessly passes Ice
tumbles from the refrigerators ice-maker into the bin

In the living room Starling is still asleep her empty
glass resting on a wood coffee table

A digital desk clock blinks 0000 Tiny sounds echo in the
dark house - the hum of the furnace the whistle of a pant
leg touching fabric on a chair slick pages being turned
a sigh

EXT STARLINGS HOUSE - DAWN

The basement window closed now reflecting the glow of
sunrise Power lines against the red sky A pigeon sitting
on the wire calling out once

INT STARLINGS HOUSE - DAWN
Starling wakes in the same position she fell asleep In
front of her is her empty glass Set down not on top of the

wood as she left it but on a thick magazine

She knows thats not right Sits up enough to see the
cover of the magazine Italian Vogue Edge of a Post-It
peeking out from the pages

to the marked page A glossy Prada advertisement for
expensive - unsensible - shoes

She uses the Post-It to turn

Hes been in her house Right here as she slept Shes up
fast rushing to her bedroom The the closet Pulling down
from the top shelf the box containing Brighams guns and ID

She slams a clip into the 45 As shes loading the little
-38 the phone rings startling her She stares at it on the
night stand next to the alarm clock 1030 AM It rings

again

She slowly crosses toward it Another ring

She

lifts the receiver Says nothing Hears nothing Until -

RECORDED VOICE
If youre not receiveing frequent flyer
miles on your credit card youre missing
out on -

She hangs up Returns to loading the gun The cell phone

on her hip rings and a bullet falls to the floor She pulls
the phone from its holster Answers it again by saying
Only listens Hears a little static Connection
to another cell phone probably Then -

nothing

LECTERS VOICE
The power on that battery is low
Clarice I wouldve changed it but I
didnt want to wake you Youre going to
have to use the other one In the
charger Hopefully the light on it is
green by now

The charger is right in front of her on the dresser
light on it is green - fully charged

LECTERS VOICE
- because this is going to be a long
call and I cant let you off because -
even though youve been stripped of your
duties I know you wont abandon them
youll try to put on a trace So well
disconnect only long enough for you to
exchange the battery in the phone for the
one in the charger Shall we say - three
seconds That should be enough You can
change the clip on a 45 quicker than
that So when I tell you to disengage
the dying battery Thatll disconnect
us Ill speed dial back If youve
succeeded in your task in the allotted
time - wonderful If not Well maybe
some other time Are you ready

STARLING
Yes

And the
LECTERS VOICE
Go

It looks like changing the clip in a gun - the low battery
falling away from the body of the phone into her hand the
charged one slapped in its place in just over two seconds
She hits the power button The LCD display lights up and
beeps The phone rings and she flips it open

LECTERS VOICE
Very good

STARLING
Thank you

LECTERS VOICE
Get in your car

She begins gathering the guns and holsters and ammo

LECTERS VOICE

Oh all right bring the guns if you
want But remember if you get caught
with a concealed unlicensed firearm in
the District of Columbia the penalty

is pretty stiff
INT STARLINGS MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY

Shes in the far right lane of a highway

Keeping just under

the speed limit The cell phone rests atop the open ashtray

LECTERS VOICE

The reason were doing it like this

Clarice is because Id like to see you
as we speak With your eyes open No
it doesnt excite me Yes it pleases

me You have very shapely feet

Call it out

STARLING

Exit 14-A Three hundred yards - two

lengths back takes the exit too

INT UNION STATION - DAY

A van several

Starling enters the huge echoing interior of the station
with a crush of travelers and Christmas shoppers She has
the phone to her ear and through it can hear the sounds not

dissimilar to those around her
LECTERS VOICE
I thought to begin you might tell me
how youre feeling

STARLING
About what

LECTERS VOICE
The masters you serve and how theyve
treated you Your career such as it is
Your life Clarice

The place is not just trains but also a mall of stores many
of them playing Christmas music Outside one of them on the
second tier Lecter cell phone to his ear watches Starling
trying to sort out the cacophony of sounds down below

STARLINGS VOICE
I thought we might talk about yours

LECTER
Mine What is there to say about mine
Im happy Healthy A little nomadic at
the moment but thatll soon change You
though You Im worried about

Carlo and Piero without phones have entered the building
and brush past people as they scan its interior looking for
and eventually spotting Starling rising up an escalator

STARLING
Im fine

LECTERS VOICE
No youre not You fell in love with
the Bureau - with The Institution - only
to discover after giving it everything -
that it doesnt love you back That it
resents you more than the husband and
children you gave up to it ever would

Lecter is going down an escalator as Starling approaches
where he was just moments ago outside the Gap Kids store

LECTER
Why is that do you think Why are you
so resented

STARLINGS VOICE
Tell me

LECTER
Tell you Isnt it clear You serve
the idea of order Clarice - they dont
You believe in the oath you took - they
dont You feel its your duty to
protect the sheep - they dont They
dont like you because theyre not like
you Theyre weak and unruly and
believe in nothing

Shes lost him Peers down over the railing Listens to the
background sounds in her phone

STARLING
Mason Verger wants to kill you Dr
Lecter Turn yourself in to me and I
promise no one will hurt you

LECTERS VOICE
Will you stay with me in my prison cell
Hmmm I suppose it wouldnt be that much
worse than yours

She hears a bell clanging Sees a Salvation Army soldier
in the far distance below his back to her his arm moving up
and down but cant tell if it synchronizes with the sound in
her phone

LECTERS VOICE
Mason doesnt want to kill me Clarice
any more than I wanted to kill him He
wants me to suffer in some - unimaginable
way Hes rather twisted you know
Always has been Have you had the
pleasure

STARLING
I have

LECTERS VOICE
Attractive isnt he But back to you -

She steps off the down escalator and heads toward the
Salvation Army soldier and his little kettle hanging from the
tripod the bell in her phone diminishing proportionally it
seems as she nears the live one

LECTERS VOICE
I want to know what it is you think you
will do now that all you cared about in
the world is gone Will you work as a
chambermaid at a motel on Route 66 like
Mom

STARLING
I dont know Dr Lec -

LECTERS VOICE
Dont you want to harm those who have
forced you to consider it I know you
never would but wouldnt you like to
Wouldnt it feel good Its all right to
admit it Its perfectly natural To
want to taste the enemy
She stops moving Listens Hears Jingle Bells in her phone

LECTERS VOICE
Are you thinking Or tracking Ex-
Special Agent Starling

Jingle Bells begins to fade in her phone Hes moving again
She turns Carlo and Piero do an abrupt about-face But not
before Starling sees them

STARLING
Theyre following me Dr Lecter

LECTERS VOICE
I know I see them Now youre ina
real dilemma arent you
Do you continue to try to find me
knowing that youre leading them to me
Do you have so much faith in your
abilites that you believe you could
somehow - simultaneously - arrest me -
and them It could get messy Clarice
Like Memphis

She can hear another voice - both live and in the phone -
Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas - and can see above heads in
the distance a department store Santa Claus in a painted
plywood sleigh She moves toward him

LECTERS VOICE
What if I did it for you

STARLING
Did what

LECTERS VOICE
Harmed them Clarice The ones whove
harmed you What if I made them scream
apologies No I shouldnt even say it
because youll feel - with your perfect
grasp on right and wrong - that you were
somehow - accompli - even though you
wouldnt be

STARLING
Dont - help me

LECTERS VOICE
No Of course not Forget I said it

Shes closing in on the sleigh and the barricade of kids and
parents around it her free hand settling on the stock of her

-45 Carlo and Piero closing with her several steps back

SANTA CLAUS
Ho - Ho - Ho
Lecter sees her and the Sardinians pushing through the crowd

LECTER
Ho ho ho indeed I think Ill be

He disconnects the call Starling breaks through the front
of the crowd moving just in front of the sleigh to scan the
faces all around her Lecter is gone

EXT DC DOWNTOWN - DAY
Traffic crawls past Christofle
INT CHRISTOFLE - DAY

An armed security guards glance drifts across Lecter
pointing out to a saleswoman the Gien French china hed like
to purchase

Later she rings up several purchases as Lecter looks on
credit card out the plates a set of aperitif glasses and
Riedel crystal linen place mats and napkins 19th-century
silverware with a pleasing heft like good dueling pistols

And finally to complete his batterie de cuisine he pays for
a newly-new Stryker autopsy saw

EXT CHESAPEAKE BAY - EVENING

A late-model but not new Ford Ranger pickup pulls into
the driveway of a small yet charming cottage nestled in the
woods

Lecter climbs out and gathers his bungy-corded shopping bags
from the truck bed including the one with the distinctive
powder blue coloring

He leaves the boxed Parker grill in back at least for the
moment carries the rest of his purchases to the front door

fiddles with the lock to get it open and disappears inside

INT STARLINGS HOUSE - EVENING
Light bleeds along the edges of a scanner Images appear

on Starlings computer screen Brighams FBI identification

she replaces his photo with hers and prints it out

INT WINE STORE - ANNAPOLIS - DAY

As a wine merchant leans slightly to take a closer look at
Starlings new ID laminated now she closes its leatherette
holder Christmas Muzak plays softly from somewhere

STARLING
Youre sure it was Chateau dY quem

WINE MERCHANT
Not only was it Chateau dY quem it was
Chateau dY quem - sixty-seven The best
bottle of wine in the store

STARLING
Can I see the tape If his car was
parked out front you may have caught the
license plate

EXT STREET - ANNAPOLIS - SAME TIME

The rear license plate of the Ford Ranger 10-foot Noble
Christmas tree in back The pickup parked across the street
from the shopping center the wine store is part of

Behind the windshield Lecter carefully surveys the people
and vehicles in the large parking lot and those appearing and
disappearing in his side and rearview mirrors well aware
that one of them could contain the Sardinians

INT WINE STORE -

Starling has come behind the counter to join the merchant as
he fast-forwards through a security tape on a small black and
white monitor

EXT STREET -

Still in his truck Lecter watches the parking lot across

the street He watches the trunk lid of a yellow cab spring
open and the driver setting his elderly fares grocery bags
into it He watches a man struggling to twine a big Douglas
fir to the roof of a sub-compact thats too small for it He
watches a rolling rattling cart without anyone attached to
it

INT WINE STORE -

Starling watches the fuzzy video tape Watches the man come
in wearing a parka and mittens and a billed cap pulled low

enough to hide his face but cant make out the license
plates on the cars parked outside
EXT STREET PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

Lecter puts the same hat on unlatches his door climbs
down He crosses the street to the lot and walks past parked
cars a box in his hand wrapped in Christmas angels paper

INT WINE STORE -

The video tape shows the wine merchant returning from the
back room wiping dust from a bottle and displaying its label
to the man in the billed hat Through the window of the
store now if she was looking she would see the same man
approaching her Mustang

EXT PARKING LOT -

A slim jim drops down the sleeve of Lecters overcoat into
his hand A barrel of a rifle somewhere rises The blade
of the slim jim slides down between the drivers side jamb
and trips the lock Something slaps at the air across the
lot Something silver embeds itself in Lecters neck

INTEXT WINE STORE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Starling glances up at the air-rifle sound Glimpses a
figure outside collapsing against the open door of her car

Squealing tires A van racing across the lot sends a cart
crashing into the door panel of an Audi

The Christmas gift falls to the pavement

Starling pulls out Brighams 45 and the wine merchant
retreats quickly to the back room She runs from the store
and kneels to aim at the van just as a Lincoln Towncar pulls

up right in front of her blocking her view

The vans back doors fling open and two men leap down
grabbing Lecter

Starling back on her feet aims over the hood of the Lincoln

STARLING
Hold it FBI On the ground

The handicapped parking placard and two old panicked faces
in the windshield of the Lincoln The screech of its tires
as it almost runs Starling over as she comes around it

The back doors of the van yanked shut from inside

Starling running toward the van then kneeling again to aim
as it takes off -

An oblivious couple sharing the weight of a Christmas tree
twenty yards ahead blocking the clear shot she almost had
The van sliding into the street and accelerating

Starling running to her car and writing down the license
plate number in the dirt on its hood

Then seeing beside her slashed front tire the trampled
Christmas package The box torn open The Prada shoes

INT FBI DC FIELD OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER - DAY

Halos around the mundane contents of a purse as it passes
through an x-ray machine the visitor it belongs to stepping
through the metal detector Shouldering the purse she
crosses the lobby to the elevators passing Pearsall coming
the other way He strides to where Starling waits - on the
street side of the security station - unable in her current
lowly status to get any deeper into the building

STARLING
I know the first thing a hysteric says
is Im not a hysteric but Im not a
hysteric Im calm

PEARSALL
Ill ask you one time Think before you
answer Think about every good thing you
ever did here Think about what you
swore What did you see

STARLING
Two men in a van A third driving
Another man shot and put into the back
Ive given you the license plate and Im
reporting it all again to you Clint
Pearsall at SAC Buzzards Point

He glances at the purse hanging from her shoulder No doubt
her Nagra is in it and taping Finally -

PEARSALL
All right Ill go with it as a
kidnapping Ill send someone out there
with the local authorities - if hell let
us on the property without a warrant -

STARLING
Im going too You could deputize -

PEARSALL
Youre not going Unless you want to be
arrested Youre going home where youll
wait for me to call and tell you what if

He turns and strides away

static of a police scanner Carlo answers it

They all cross onto the polished linoleum floor

The hand truck stops Strapped to it is a singletree a

hospital bed

Three pairs of incisors one pair of
elongated canines three pairs of molars
four pairs of pre-molars upper and lower

in the science lecture

The meal will begin with an apertivo
tartare Your feet The main course -
the rest of you - wont be served until
seven hours later but during that time
youll be able to enjoy the effects of
the consumed appetizer with a full-
bodied saline drip
No reaction that can be read at least from Lecter

MASON

Much as Id love to I wont be joining
you at the table since I cant move but
I will be watching a 3-camera video feed
here and Ill try to stay awake

able then)

EXT VERGERS ESTATE - DAY

Starlings Mustang creeps along the service road without the
aid of its headlights Up ahead about a quarter mile in the
trees she can see the glare of a floodlight

She stops Pulls the trunk release Climbs out and comes
around to it Rummages around the debris inside and selects
four pairs of cuffs extra ammo a knife and a flashlight

She leaves the trunk ajar aims the flashlight down switches
it on and leads herself with its beam - careful to keep it no
more than two or three steps ahead - into the woods

INT BARN - NIGHT

Lecter still trussed to the singletree prone now on the
hand truck stares up at the rafters where Tommaso sits in a
cane chair a rifle in his lap

Below one of three closed-circuit video cameras mounted
on tripods watches as Carlo not being too careful about it
pierces his wrist with an IV needle

LECTER
Your brother must smell worse than you

do by now

The blade of Carlos knife is against Lecters throat in
an instant From an intercom -

MASONS VOICE
No no no - dont hurt him

Lecter smiles at the Sardinian The knife slowly comes away
from his neck leaving only a little blood

Piero meanwhile is adjusting the angle of a gilt-framed
mirror hanging above the slatted gate Lecters feet will soon
be stuck through

And turn off that radio I cant hear
anything

A shortwave radio on a wooden table thats broadcasting a
soccer game in Italian As Piero crosses to it -

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Starling still listens as the already-faint sound of the
Italian announcers voice fades to nothing She continues on
again toward the floodlit area beyond the trees until another
sound stops her Another recorded voice Begging and
screaming in Italian

Suddenly through the trees all around her dark shapes are
moving fast She wants to but dares not point the flashlight
at them if theyre armed the beam may as well be a painted
target on her chest

She crouches Catches a glimpse of something big running
close to the ground past the trucks of the trees near her
Then its gone

INTEXT BARN - NIGHT

The wild boars appear in the reflection of the large-gold-
framed mirror jostling into a semi-circle like berserk
linemen posing for a team photo

Piero dials down the screaming tape Carlo rights the hand
truck hooks a saline bag to it and wheels it toward the
slatted gate Tipped back rolling slowly closer to his
death Lecter begins humming Pomp and Circumstance

INT VERGERS CHAMBER - NIGHT
Verger glancing between three monitors displaying the
upcoming live event glimpses something in one of them as it
darts along the fence line of the pen then disappears
MASON

What was that Cordell Did you see

that
INTEXT BARN - NIGHT

A boom of a 45 echoes in the barn Tommaso still up in
the loft throws himself down against the planks

STARLING
Hold it Hands where I can see -

Carlos hand swings around with a 357 in it Starling
fires once knocking him back against the gate Piero makes
a move toward the fallen gun but stops when he sees a slat
splinter right next to it the boars surging at the gate to
get to Carlo on the ground just inside it

STARLING
Down

Piero kneels with his empty hands aloft Starling crosses
quickly with a set of handcuffs In the loft Tommaso crawls
along the planks as she disappears from his view Down below
Lecter cranes his head to watch Starling pick up the gun

LECTER
Good evening Clar -

STARLING
Shut up

She kneels Lecter tries to bend his head to watch her snap
a cuff around one of Carlos wrists

STARLING
Can you walk

LECTER
Well I dont know May I try

The boars pound against the gate trying to get at Carlo
Starling drags him a couple of feet away and pulls a knife
from an ankle strap

STARLING
Im going to cut you loose If you touch
me Ill shoot you

LECTER
Understood perfectly

STARLING
Do right and youll live through this

LECTER
Spoken like a Protestant

She cuts one of his arms free keeping her gun trained on
Piero still on the ground by Carlo The boars shatter
another slat

LECTER
This might go a little quicker if you

give me the knife

She hesitates Then gives it to him As he cuts at the
ropes she works to lock the other end of Carlos cuffs onto
Pieros wrist As he removes the mask -

LECTER
Clarice

STARLING
What

LECTER

My back was turned when you came in
Was that a warning shot or did you kill
the one in the loft

She spins around aiming up just as the bullet from the
rifle slams into her unvested abdomen Going down she pulls
off three quick shots hitting Tommaso in the chest

As he falls from the loft the boars come crashing through
the gate Piero desperately tries to get away dragging the
dead weight of Carlo behind him Lecter lifts Starling from
the ground blood running onto his fingers

Piero is pulled down Lecter holding Starling surrounded
by the animals too stands perfectly still as the boars
ravage the three Sardinians

INT VERGERS CHAMBER - SAME TIME
Verger stares in disbelief at the monitor that shows nothing
but the moving mass of the boars thrashing around but leaving

alone Lecters legs

MASON
Why arent they - Cordell -

CORDELL
I have to go now -

MASON
No In the drawer - right by your
hand Open it Open it

Cordell opens the drawer revealing a semi-automatic pistol

MASON
Take it Go down there Shoot him

CORDELL
No I -

MASON
Youre involved is what you are

Hes frightened is what he is Hes a medical doctor for
Christs sake not a hunter of madmen He stares at Verger
CORDELL
What did you say -

MASON
I said youre involved In all of it

Cordell seems to understand nods in resignation and turns
as if to take the gun

MASON
Good Now -

Cordell plunges his hand into the aquarium and turns back
holding the writhing eel Watching him approach the bed with
it Verger for once is speechless staring at the serpents
clicking teeth

CORDELL
Good night Mason

As Cordell thrusts the head of the eel toward Vergers gaping
mouth —-

INTEXT BARN - SAME TIME
Lecter carrying Starling stares a couple of the boars in
the eye wades through them with impunity steps out past the
splintered gate and disappears into the woods
EXT CHESAPEAKE BAY - EVENING
A pair of distant headlights floating along the shoreline
INT KRENDLERS CAR - EVENING
Krendler trying to keep the agitation out of his voice
speaks with an assistant on his car phone as he negotiates
the dark ribbon of road
KRENDLER

Ill be out at my weekend place

through Sunday I dont want any calls

forwarded No not even him Nobody
He hangs up Wipes at beads of sweat just below the
sweatband of his jogging ensemble as his destination his
weekend cottage comes into view through the windshield
EXT KRENDLERS COTTAGE - NIGHT
The car pulls into the driveway Krendler gathers up the
grocery bag from the passenger seat and carries it toward the
front door of his cottage which also happens to be Lecters

INT KRENDLERSLECTERS COTTAGE - NIGHT

Krendler comes into the darkened kitchen Tries a light
switch that doesnt work Sets the grocery bag on a counter
pulls open a drawer and takes out a corkscrew As he takes a
bottle of cheap Chianti from the bag he notices a simple
strand of Christmas lights around a window Doesnt remember
hanging them Stares cocking his head the way he does

LECTERS VOICE
Oh good you brought wine

Before Krendler can turn his mouth is covered with an ether-
soaked dish towel

INT KRENDLERS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Starlings eyes open and slowly take in her surroundings

the small unfamiliar room the bed shes in the night stand
and the empty morphine vials on it the silver tray with the
crumpled bullet on it

She eases the blanket down enough to see her T-shirt eases
the T-shirt up enough to see the bandage ease the bandage
away enough to see the stitched gunshot wound

She hears quiet Christmas music and muffled voices from
elsewhere in the house Two men speaking in conversational
tones She drags herself from the bed steadies herself
slowly crosses the room to and down a hallway

At the end of it she see A decorated Christmas tree

An archway to a dining room candles on the dining table
Krendler in his running clothes and sweatband sitting at
the head of it Lecter standing beside a portable grill on
a service cart stirring at a saute pan with a wooden spoon

KRENDLER
Are those shallots

LECTER
Ummm And caper berries

KRENDLER
The butter smells wonderful

Starling glances from Krendlers face to his hands He
doesnt seem to notice or care that theyre duct-taped to the
arms of a wheelchair

INT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Back in the bedroom Starling uses her teeth to strip the
4-pin telephone wire thats been yanked from the wall jack

INT DINING ROOM - SAME TIME
As Lecter executes a modest flambe with a little brandy -

LECTER
I hope youre hungry Paul

KRENDLER
Very Whats the main course

LECTER
Oh you never ask It spoils the
surprise

Lecter notices but seems unconcerned as the line-light
blinks on a telephone

INT BEDROOM -

Starling searches drawers for some kind of weapon as she
whispers into the phone -

STARLING
I dont have the address but I think
the house belongs to the hostage whose
name is Paul Krendler -

911 OPERATOR
I have it from the phone number Now
if you can safely do it get out of the
house Otherwise stay on the line where
you are The response time should be ten
minutes Im putting you on hold for
just a moment

Starling hears an unusual sound from the other room but
not so unusual that she doesnt recognize it Its the whir
of an autopsy saw She sets the receiver on the bed and -

911 OPERATOR
Im back Maam -

The phone goes dead as Starling yanks the 25-foot cord from
the wall and wraps it quickly around her hand taking it with
her perhaps to use as a garrote as she leaves the room

INT HALL DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Shes moving along the hall again Hears the whir of the

saw grinding through - something - then stop She picks up a
heavy glass paperweight from a bookcase shelf and conceals it
in her hand

She reaches the doorway to the living room and adjacent
dining area Sees Lecter straightening Krendlers sweatband
The doctor glances up and regards her calmly

LECTER
Clarice What are you doing up
You should be resting Get back to bed

STARLING
Im hungry

Krendlers head slowly turns to follow her as she crosses
into the dining room unsteadily

STARLING
Hello Paul

He doesnt respond He seems in some kind of trance

LECTER
Paul Dont be rude Say hello to
Agent Starling

KRENDLER
Hello Starling I always wanted to
watch you eat

As Lecter lays out another place setting of fine china (but
not silverware) for Starling she sees the spent syringe and
the autopsy saw on a trivet next to the butane grill

LECTER
Would you like to say grace

KRENDLER
Me Grace Okay

He bows his head Starling and Lecter dont She glances to
the twisting pendulum of a hurricane clock The doctor just
smiles faintly well aware of the response time

KRENDLER
Father we thank thee for the blessings
we are about to receive and dedicate them
to Thy mercy Forgive us all even white
trash like Starling here and bring her
into my service Amen

As his head comes back up a single rivulet of blood drips
out from under the sweatband Lecter stirs at his beurre-
noisette

LECTER
Paul I have to tell you the Apostle
Paul couldnt have done better He hated
women too

Krendler smiles rather stupidly at Starling As much as she
hates him she doesnt want to see what she thinks Lecter has
in store for him and tries to forestall it with conversation
and requests -

STARLING
May I have some wine

LECTER
I dont think thats a good idea
Clarice Not with the morphine Better
you should have some broth

Lecter sets about ladling her and Krendler tureens of it

KRENDLER
By the way Starling that was a job
offer I worked into the blessing Im
going to Congress you know

STARLING
Are you

KRENDLER
Come around campaign headquarters
You could be an office girl Can you
type and file Can you take dictation
Take this down Washington is full of
cornpone country pussy

STARLING
I already took that down You said it
before

LECTER

Paul Please Now you are being rude
Drink your broth

As Lecter puts a straw in the tureen to Krendlers lips
and whispers something in his ear Starling eyes the sharper
utensils on the other side of the table next to the grill

KRENDLER
This soups not very good

LECTER
I admit I added a little something extra
to yours Perhaps its clashing with the
cumin I assure you though youll love
the second course that is if I can serve
it before Clarice bashes my head in

He commands her to show him whats in the hand in her lap
with a smile and a slight tip of his head She obeys
setting the paperweight weapon on the table

KRENDLER
Hey thats mine

Lecter rakes it across to him with a folk like a croupier
As Krendler shakes it and watches snow fall on the Capital
building hes oblivious to Lecter taking off his sweatband
revealing the neat incision carved all the way around

Starling can do little more than we can as Lecter lifts
the top of Krendlers head off - staring in disbelief at the
pinky-gray dome of Krendlers exposed brain Lecter reaches
for a set of tonsil spoons as the butter in the saute pan
sizzles to a golden brown

STARLING
I really would like some wine

Lecter poised over Krendlers brain with the tongs looks at
her disapprovingly Shes holding out her empty glass like
Oliver as the pendulum twists back and forth

LECTER
All right But just a little

He sets the spoons down Pours some Chateau dY quem into
her glass as he glances to the twisting pendulum

LECTER
Unlike Paul I unfortunately cant
offer you a job in government But I am
curious What will you do now

Right now her hand is slowly inching across the tablecloth
toward a serrated knife Lecter picks it up and one of the
tongs and deftly severs the thalamus of Krendlers brain -

STARLING
Doctor Lec -

LECTER
You certainly cant return to the
bureau Not that youd want to Even
if you could convince them to take you
back after all this the Stain of Rein-
statement would never go away

Krendlers eyes look up as if to see whats going on then
follow Lecters hands as he sets his prefrontal lobe in the
saute pan

KRENDLER
What did you say

STARLING
I didnt say anything

KRENDLER
I had plans for that smart mouth but
Id never hire you now Who gave you an
appointment anyway

Lecter picks up the tongs again to scoop out another lobe

LECTER
The brain itself feels no pain Clarice
if that concerns you And Paul certainly
wont miss this - the prefrontal lobe is
He spoons

the

Dr

seat of manners

STARLING
Lecter your profile at the border

stations has five features Ill trade

you

Stop now and Ill tell you what

they are

LECTER

Trade How does that word taste to you
Clarice Cheap and metallic like sucking
on a greasy coin to me Your soup is
getting cold

out

a second lobe and stirs it into the pan -

KRENDLER

That smells great

LECTER

Have a taste Paul

He slides a taste of the second course onto a small plate
forks a piece and slips it into Krendlers open mouth

KRENDLER

Ummm it is good

Dr

No

STARLING
Lec -

LECTER
I think a new life lies before you

A better life With me Hmmm theres a
thought

Is he serious He seems to be Krendler glances stupidly
from him to her and back again

LECTER

I came halfway around the world just to
watch you run in the woods Run with me
Clarice

Who

KRENDLER

LECTER

Agent Starling Paul If you cant keep
up with the conversation its better you

don

t try to join in at all

KRENDLER

Who

STARLING
Paul Im Starling
KRENDLER
I dont think you could even answer my
phones whoever you are That accent is
just too - Appalachian The Honorable
Paul Krendlers office

LECTER
Paul

KRENDLER
What

LECTER

Remember what I said before If you
cant be polite to the other guests you
have to sit at the kids table

He sets the plates and sauce pan and all the utensils -
including the knife - in Krendlers lap and unlocks the
wheels of the chair

LECTER
Ill just be a minute cleaning up
Clarice Dont get up Paul will help me
clear

As Lecter pushes Krendler toward the kitchen he glimpses
on the way the headlights of a line of cars coming silently
along the shoreline

LECTER
Think about what I said but dont drink
any more wine while you do Doctors
orders

As soon as the door to the kitchen swings shut she gets

up too fast almost faints sits back down Listening for a
moment to the scraping of plates she tries again to stand
slower this time she blows out a candle grasps the stem of
the heavy brass holder and with it and the phone cord slowly
crosses toward the closed kitchen door

She slowly eases it open revealing Lecter his back to
her scraping the leftovers into Krendlers head and setting
the plates neatly in the dishwasher He closes its door then
and switches it on and keeping his back to her begins
wiping down the counters with a dish towel

a

e eases past the door gripping the heavy candlestick and
lowly approaches Lecter from behind grateful for the hum of
the dishwasher that covers the creaking of the floorboards

io)

Krendler is staring right at her as he shakes his Capital
paperweight She places a finger to her lips to tell him not
to speak and he glances away to the tiny falling snow
KRENDLER
Would you like to swing on a star -
Carry moonbeams home in a jar -

The candlestick comes up and hangs there - as if Starling
isnt entirely sure she wants to crack Lecters skull open -
but then it does come down hard right at his head and -

Turning he catches her wrist in his hand and pushes her
roughly against the refrigerator toppling the wheelchair and
Krendler the rest of his brain and some leftovers spilling
onto the floor Lecter holds Starling firmly in his grip
staring at her intending it appears to kill her But
then quietly -

LECTER
Thats my girl If you hadnt tried
I would have killed you But dont try
again I mean it

He lets her hands go and she immediately lunges for him
again He grabs her wrists again pushes her back up against
the fridge opens it enough to catch her pnytail in the door
and shoves the candlestick through the side-by-side handles

LECTER
Oh Clarice you are the honey in the
lion In times to come whenever you see

yourself naked whenever you see the scar
- the guality of the stitching - youll
remember this moment -

His face his sharp teeth come threateningly close to her
He kisses her hard on the mouth

LECTER
- and your lips will burn

He steps away past Krendler and the wheelchair picks up
a small Tupperware container from the counter and walks out
leaving her to try to free herself

EXT THE COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Starling comes slowly out onto the porch Looks for
movement in the dark shapes of the trees across the road and
sees none Looks out across the Chesapeake and sees nothing
in its dark water - except that the little rowboat once
tied to the dock is now gone

Feeling faint again - or just tired of it all - she sits on
the porch swing slows her breathing and the pounding of her
heart listens to the creak of the chains and the growl of
the approaching police cars and watches the glare of the
approaching headlights play across the dark trees of the
forest

DISSOLVES TO
A RECLINING WOMAN
asleep on a blanket on a beach Starling A beach ball
and a Walkman resting beside her The cord runs up across
the scar on her exposed midriff to a light pair of head-

phones Instead of music she hears static before -

MAN VO
How are you covering yourself

WOMAN VO
Polaroids monkey business and none of
your business Im not going to run

One-point-five-mil Ricky flat fee

The conversation is overtaken by static again Keeping her
eyes closed Starling nudges the beach ball and the voices of
the man and woman just two tiny figures waist deep in the
Miami beach surf reemerge from the static -

WOMAN VO
No discussion Just yes or no

MAN VO
Yes Well make the transfer at the
Sun Trust conference room in the vault
Ill bring my lockbox you bring yours

A beachcomber passes walking along the wet sand between
Starling on the beach and the couple in the water Crawford
In the headphones Starling hears -

CRAWFORD VO
And well join the party too Thats
it Starling You just made us our ten
percent And all you had to do was put
on sun screen

She smiles without opening her eyes Reaches down out of
habit to adjust her top to cover the scar

A RECLINING SLEEPING BOY

in a darkened 747 cabin window shades down movie
flickering Stewardesses move down the aisle gathering the
last of the lunch trays

Sitting in coach next to the sleeping six year old boy
Lecter in Toronto Maple Leafs sweats waits until hes sure
no one is looking at him then careful not to wake the boy
reaches down under the seat in front of him finds a box
and sets it on his lap

Its from Dean and DeLuca Tied with a ribbon Lecter unknots
it Opens the lid Inside are Anatolian figs pate de foie

gras a half-bottle of St Estephe and some silverware
