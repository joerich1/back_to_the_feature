And then she stops Her face stunned Henry stares at her
Sees the queer look on her face

HENRY
Can I help you with something

And now she smilesher heart is caught in her throat

HENRY
Yes

And just as suddenly tears spring to her eyes

GIRL
Henry It’s you

INT HENRY’S APARTMENT - EVENING 23

THE CAMERA TRACKS through Henry’s messy apartment - clothes
dirty cups books strewn about - a bouquet of roses in
cellophane sitting on the table until it discovers Henry
standing in front of a mirror in his bathroom He’s nervous
making an effort He checks his teeth in the mirror then
opens the cabinet removes a deodorant stick and opens his
shirt doing a quick run across his pits He reaches toward
the cabinet to put it back the camera TRACKING with his arm
We see his HAND IS SHAKING

HENRY (VO)

The cabinet door swings closed There is no one in the
mirror

INT BEAU THAI RESTAURANT - NIGHT (SPRING) 25
A CLOCK on the wall shows that it is 739 pm

We PAN DOWN OFF IT to reveal CLARE sitting at a booth She
looks beautiful in a dress her hair down curled A waiter
comes up to her

WAITER
Would you like to order a drink
while you’re waiting

CLARE
Just some wine please

The waiter goes off She looks down fiddling with something

CLOSE ON THE OBJECT IN HER HAND a small girl’s diary blue
leather with a little brass locking flap Then

She looks up HENRY IS THERE his face covered in
perspiration and bruised He is breathless as he sees her
He awkwardly hands her the bouquet of flowers

HENRY
I’m really sorry I wasuh
detained

CLARE
It’s okay I ordered us some Pad
Thai They’re keeping it warm

She notices his bruises

CLARE (CONTD)
You alright

HENRY
It’sit’s okay

CLARE
Come sit down

He sits They stare at each other a moment There’s a feeling
of first date excitement here though neither really knows
how to play it

Clare admires the flowers
CLARE (CONTD)

These are beautiful You’ve never
given me flowers before

The Time Travelers Wife - White Prod Draft - 071307 15
25

HENRY
I’ve never given you anything
before

She smiles He doesn’t quite know how to read it The waiter
brings her wine They wait for him to leave

HENRY (CONTD)
Listen you do understand why it is
that I don’t know you

CLARE
Of course For you none of this
has happened yet but for meI’ve
known you since I was six Since
you appeared in the meadow behind
my parents’ house in Michigan
where I used to play

While she’s talking Henry has taken her glass of wine and
downed a big draught He pushes it back She frowns

CLARE (CONTD)
You’re not supposed to drink

HENRY
Yeah why’s that

CLARE
You told me Dr Kendrick said you
should stop drinking that it sets
off thefit the travel
Henry stares at her for a beat

HENRY
This isthis is too crazy

CLARE
I’m sorry I’m doing this all
wrong You told me to be easy on
you and I’m doing it all wrong
She grabs a paper napkin and takes a pen out of her purse

CLARE (CONTD)
You did this for me once

She draws two straight lines Labels one Henry and one Clare

The Time Travelers Wife - White Prod Draft - 071307

CLARE (CONTD)
This line is my life and this line
is your life

She makes a little slash near the middle of his line

CLARE (CONTD)
This point is you now tonight

Her finger follows past the point of now down Henry’s
line

CLARE (CONTD)
And later on down the line of your
life in the future you cross
back

She draws a connecting line that slants backward to the
early part of her line

CLARE (CONTD)
And I meet you here at the
beginning of my line

HENRY
When you were six In the meadow

CLARE
And many more times After a while
I couldn’t wait for you to come
back

HENRY
Which I gather I did or will do
fairly often

She nods

CLARE
The last time I saw you I was
eighteen
(beat)
It seems you go back to the same
places a lot At least that’s what
you told me

HENRY
It’s like gravity Big events pull
you in

CLARE

So I was a big event

The Time Travelers Wife - White Prod Draft - 071307 17
25

HENRY
So it would seem

Henry squirms a little in his seat He rubs one of his
bruises unconsciously It hurts

HENRY (CONTD)
Clare

CLARE
Yes

HENRY
Could we back up Could we pretend
for a moment that this is a normal
first date between two normal
people

CLARE
Sure Of course I’m so sorry
Henry I keep forgetting It’s
just you know it’s like you’re my
best friend I’veI’ve been in
love with youall my life

On Henry taking this in Clare can see how hard it is for
him She dips a napkin in a glass of ice water She reaches
over and touches his bruises with the napkin He cannot
believe she is doing this It is intimate impossibly
familiar but he doesn’t stop her

INT HENRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 26
Sounds of voices as locks unclick a door opening

A POV through a cloth images of shadow sifted through
thin fabric a little light coming through

CLARE

CLARE (CONTD)

sixty-seven thousand a million

She takes off the blindfold

HER POV Henry has put a cloth over a lamp to mute the
light It makes the apartment seem romantic a reader’s
garret piled with books a couch covered with an Indian
print blanket

He stands there smiling sort of dumbly at this beautiful
girl standing in his flat clearly smitten with it with
him

HENRY
If you want a drink

CLARE
I don’t want a drink

She steps up to him looks into his eyes and starts
unbuttoning his shirt He just stares at her It’s amazing to
him that she’s so sure that they don’t have to play any
games He could fall in love with this girl

She parts the fabric of his shirt and runs her hands along
his chest his belly

CLARE (CONTD)
God You’re soyoung

She kisses his neck his mouth a passionate familiar kiss
It blows him away her confidence the way their mouths fit

He pulls her in to him roughly now he wants her his hands
running up to her breasts He is young and eager discovering
a new body She pushes him back Makes him sit on the couch
Climbs on top of him straddling him but he flips her onto
her back and in so doing KICKS HER PURSE overeverything
dumps onto the floor It’s more than a little awkward

HENRY
Sorry

He quickly picks up the stuffhe has the DIARY She grabs
it away from him shoves the purse away

HENRY (CONTD)
What was that

CLARE
My diary My Henry book I used to
write about you every time you

CLARE (CONTD)
came to visit because it was a
secret I couldn’t tell anyone

HENRY
Can I see it

CLARE
The silly scribblings of a
hopelessly romantic girl Never

She starts over climbing back on top of him wrapping her
legs around him This time he lets her lead She kisses him
They are getting more passionate limbs intertwining She
kisses his neck his chest his belly

HENRY
Claretell me something
about the meadow Tell me how we
met

CLARE
It‘ll spoil it for you It won’t
happen for you for several years

HENRY
Spoil me

EXT SUN-FILLED MEADOW - DAY (SPRING) 27

We see flashes of hair of little feet in Mary Janes and knee
socks we HEAR humming as young CLARE eight-years-old
pushes through the sun-dappled woods and into

AN OPEN GRASSY MEADOW She is in her school uniform a green
jumper and white blouse She is carrying a tattered Marshall
Field’s shopping bag and a RED BLANKET which she lays out by
a log that lies like a perfect bench in the clearing She
continues hummingthe theme to “The Dick Van Dyke Show”

Suddenly from behind some bushes she sees something move

CLARE
Whos there

No answer She gets up to explore Suddenly a voice comes
from very close to her in the foliage

HENRY (0S)
Greetings Earthling

CLARE
Mark you idiot

The Time Travelers Wife - White Prod Draft - 071307 20
27

She takes off her shoe and throws it into the bushes She
sees the bushes shake hears a grunt and an “Ow”

HENRY (0S)
Clare I’m not going to hurt you
please don’t throw anything at me

Little girl Clare frowns hands on her hips To hide her
fear she fires out bossy questions

CLARE
Who are you How do you know my
name Why can’t you come out

HENRY (0S)
I don’thave any clothes on

Clare stares into the bushes

HER POV She can now see Henry his face his eyes and
nothing else

HENRY (CONTD)
Can you justhand me that
blanket And I’1l come out

CLARE
Maybe I should call my mom

HENRY
Don’t call your Mom Please Just
give me the towel and Ill leave

She hesitates Then goes back to the log picks up the
blanket comes back to the bushes and holds it out

We see Henry’s hand emerge from the bushes grabbing the
blanket then Henry appears with it wrapped around his waist

Clare sort of laughs

CLARE
Why don’t you have any clothes

HENRY
Because I’m a time traveler I come
from the future and when I do I
don’t get to bring my clothes

CLARE

There’s no such thing as time
travelers

She smiles slightly to herself

CLARE
Prove you’re from the future

HENRY

Well your name is Clare Abshire

Phillip and Lucille Abshire and
you live with them and your brother
Mark and your sister Alicia in a
big house on the other side of the
woods

CLARE
So You know things That doesn’t
mean you’re from the future

HENRY
If you hang around long enough
youll see me disappear And I’11
be back again Lots of times In
fact I’ll be back next Tuesday at
400 It would be great if when you
come then you could bring me some
clothing something your dad won’t

hold on her stunned little face She smiles

looks over at him Smiles Can’t believe she’s with him She
sits up trying to be quiet

the floor The paint is peeling in the room Pretty ugly

She gets out of bed pulling on one of his shirts which is a
bit smelly but she does it anyway

INT LIVING ROOM 29

She pads out into the room Last night’s couch is revealed to
be horrible -- tattered stuffing coming out stained with
water-rings and telltale cigarette burns

Clare looks around The gray morning light coming in the
windows illuminates his apartment Beer cans and dirty dishes
are dotted around It is the apartment of a callow young man
Not romantic at all

INT BATHROOM - MORNING 30
Clare comes in Opens the shower curtain

HER POV In the bath tub is a lot of books and papers and
dirty clothes Some styrofoam take-out cartons with half-
eaten food He obviously dumped them in here the night before
in an attempt to clean up

Clare opens the medicine chest and peers inside Lying on
one shelf are tampons a diaphragm case lipstick and a tube
of spermicide

ON HER FACE fascinated and surprised She never thought that
he might be with someone She hears Henry

HENRY (VO)

(appearing in the doorway)
messy

She turns to him She’s holding the woman’s lipstick

CLARE
You have a girlfriend

HENRY
Yes I mean no I mean it was
almost over anyway

CLARE
(deflated)
I came bulldozing in here It never
occurred to me that you might be
with someone

HENRY

Clare runs both hands down the flank of Henry’s body

CLARE
It feels so odd I never knew you
at this age I’ve only known you as
this mature worldly person You
knewexactly how to talk to me
You were kind of my perfect guy

HENRY
My God I’m competing with myself

CLARE
No no it’s hard to explain

HENRY
The me you know doesn’t exist yet
Stick with me and sooner or later

CUT TO
EXT CAMPUS BUILDING - NIGHT 31
A PHOTOGRAPHlarge printed on an unusual surface It is a
life-sized picture of a man standing in a meadow but his
features are obscured by the flecks in the paper in fact
his entire body seem to be dissolving away Only his clothes

with their dark colors are in sharp focus

We pull back as a JANITOR crosses in front of the picture
mopping the floor

Stencilled on the window of the lobby of a campus building
are the words “Graduate Student Exhibit” HENRY’S REFLECTION
moves into frame as he looks in the window

Henry goes inside seeking something and thenHE STOPS
His face registers part shock part total recognition

HIS POV OF THE PHOTOGRAPH

He sees a nameplate above it CLARE ABSHIRE

REVERSE ANGLEon Henry’s back as he looks at the photo
his own body silhouetted against the figure in the image
their shapes matching for a brief moment as he steps back

and we HEAR off screen

CLARE (0S)
The show’s not open yet

He turns Clare is there Henry stands next to the photograph
and from Clare’s POV it looks like she’s facing two of him

HENRY
I thought I’d try early for a
change

YCLARE
How did you find it I didn’t tell
you

HENRY

I’m a research librarian If I want
to find out about someone I find
out

She smiles pleased A little embarrassed They look at the
photograph standing side by side in silence for a moment

CLARE
Well what do you think

HENRY
It’s great it’sterrifying

CLARE
Terrifying

HENRY
My life depends on how well I can
keep a secret Seeing it out there
like thatfeels like I just went
public

CLARE
God I never even thought of
that
HENRY

Don’t worry I mean who’s gonna
connect the dots right It just
caught me off-guard

He smiles at her bringing levity to the moment

CLARE
I know what it’s like to watch you
go But what’s it liketo be the
one that’s going

HENRY
Sometimes it feels like you’ve
stood up too quickly your hands
and feet are tingling and then they
aren’t there at all Sometimes it
feels like your attention has
wandered for just an instant Then
with a start you realize that
you’re standing naked up to your
ankles in ice water in a ditch You
wait a minute to see if youll just
snap right back Then after some
swearing and shivering you start
walking in any direction which
will eventually yield someplace
that offers the option of stealing
or explaining Stealing can get you
in trouble but explaining takes
more time and involves lying which
might get in trouble anyways so
what the hell

32 EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT 32
They are walking together mid-conversation

CLARE
Are you ever afraid

HENRY
Absolutely I’m afraid of finding
myself in the middle of a highway
getting hit by a car I’m afraid of
getting stranded in time and not
being able to come back

The Time Travelers Wife - White Prod Draft - 071307

CLARE
When I was little I used to wish
that you would get stuck I
imagined I’d move you into the
basement and you could live with me
all the time and I’d sneak you
food like when you would come to
the meadow

HENRY
You bring me food in the meadow

CLARE
Peanut butter and anchovy
sandwiches pate and beets on Ritz
crackers I thought that’s the sort
of thing an adult would like

He smiles at her

HENRY
How did your parents never get wind
of this

CLARE

My parents are very self-absorbed
ambitious people They like to win
at everything even if the opponent
is their own children I was much
toodreamy for them After a
while they just ignored me

They arrive at her car He stops turns to her

HENRY
I can’t believe anyone could ignore
you

CLARE

You never did You were wonderful

HENRY
You mean the perfect me

She smiles He touches her slender neck Bends his head down
and kisses her ever so softly on the lips It’s like a first

kiss in many ways They both feel it

Gomez lights up a cigarette when he sees

A BRAWL in progress at the end of the alley near the trash
cans someone is getting beat up

GOMEZ

He runs down and tries to break up the fight

A BIG SUBURBAN GUY is having the crap beat out of him by a

You’re such a tease

CLARE
True When I was sixteen I was
waiting for you late one night It
was about eleven o’clock and there
was a new moon

(taking a bite)

Oh my god this is amazing Anyway
I was kind of annoyed with you
because you were resolutely
treating me like - a child or a
pal or whatever - and I was just
crazy to touch you andbe touched
by you and then I got this idea
that I would hide your clothes

HENRY
Oh no

CLARE
Yes So I moved the clothes to a
different spot And you appeared
and I basically teased you until
you couldn’t take it

HENRY
And

CLARE
You jumped me and pinned me and
for about thirty seconds we both
thought ‘This is it’ But you got
this look on your face and you
said ‘No’ and you got up and
walked away You walked right
through the Meadow into the trees
and I didn’t see you again for
three weeks

HENRY
That’s a better man than I

You do bad things

I have done one or two of those

CLARE
Like read my private diary

This shifts the dynamic between them

HENRY
Did Gomez tell you that

CLARE
Don’t be mad at him He meant well

HENRY
I didn’t read it I just wanted to
write down the dates The dates I
go to see you and memorize them
So I can tell the little girl in
the meadow I don’t want that girl
to be hurt If I’m so important to
her I want to be able to tell her
when I’m coming so she won’t wait
and hope and waste away like I
did as a kid you know wishing

CLARE
Wishing what

HENRY
That someone I love would come
back

She looks at him moved unsure what to say in this moment

HENRY (CONTD)
Stay here

He goes into the bedroom and comes back holding a tiny
jewelry box Clare knows what’s coming She’s not sure if
she’s ready

HENRY (CONTD)
Clare I love you And it’s not
just because you’re beautiful and
brilliant and smart It’s

filling with tears as he opens the box

Will you marry me

She stares at him The mirth has faded away She feels so
much weight in this decision

CLARE

Henry is shoved into the long metal tube as everyone leaves
the room The machine is turned on A sudden knocking and
banging as the magnetic resonators capture pictures of
Henry’s brain

CUT TO
INT THE CONTROL ROOM - DAY 98

One of the assistants is watching the monitor a very static
image of Henry lying motionless inside the tube Suddenly
Henry disappears The assistant jumps up panicked and
confused and stares into the MRI room The MRI chamber is
empty

ASSISTANT
Dr Kendrick Dr Kendrick He’s
gone He’s just gone

Dr Kendrick doesn’t even look up from a notebook he is
jotting on

DR KENDRICK

The assistant looks at him like one of them is out of their
mind

INT KENDRICK’S OFFICE - DAY (FALL) 99

Autumn outside Henry and Clare are sitting with Kendrick who
is showing them a sheaf full of test results

KENDRICK
Alright The results are back

Clare and Henry look at each other and smile nervous about
what they will hear

KENDRICK (CONTD)
Based on the tests we ran we can
affirm as you suspected that your
brain emits a blast of electro-
magnetic energy akin to an
epileptic’s just at the moment that
youtravel You can see it here

He shows them the images
KENDRICK (CONTD)

But that’s not going to help you
now with another baby on the way

The Time Travelers Wife - White Prod Draft - 071307 74

Clare and Henry glance at each other Clare puts her hand on

her belly

KENDRICK (CONTD)
These types of drugs are much too
strong for a fetus

CLARE
We’re eight weeks in It seems to
be going pretty well Maybe the
last miscarriage was just a fluke

KENDRICK
We’re going to find out We’re
going to look at Henry’s genes A
disease that is asdisruptive as
Henry’s often appears as a kind of
stutter A bit of code repeated
too many times that says in
essence Bad News Huntington’s
Disease for instance is just a
bunch of extra CAG triplets on
Chromosome 4

CLARE
But how do you know which

KENDRICK
Educated guessing Like any
scientific endeavor We’re going to
look at what we call the clock
genes They govern circadian
rhythms keep you in sync with the
sun and they exist in many
different types of cells all over
the body

As Kendrick goes on Clare and Henry take hands

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

fast to avoid it and swerves up onto a curb He slams on the
