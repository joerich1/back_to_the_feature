No -- I know its not But its

kind of a personal challenge to me
to see what we can do to bring local
service up to the same kinds of
standards wed be trying to meet if
we were the biggest branch in the
state And that means I dont want
anybody running out at 315 or 330

hole explaining myself to you again

TERRY
Well Im not really sure why youre
here Ron I mean I realize I havent
exactly been a model citizen since I
got here but compared to how things
have been goin for me lately I
thought I was doing pretty well

He turns to Sammy

TERRY
And I also find it kind of
discouraging that you seem to think
I need some kind of spiritual
counseling or what have you so much
so that youre willing to disregard
the fact that I dont believe in any
of this stuff at all --

SAMMY
Well I didnt mean to discourage
you --

TERRY

I mean its really kind of insulting

RON

Can I say something here

(Pause)
Sammy asked me to come and talk to
you because its her opinion that
youre not gonna find what youre
looking for the way youre looking
for it --

TERRY
How would she know

RON
But Im really not here to try to
get you to do anything or to believe
anything And Ill tell you the same
thing I told her which is that as
far as Im concerned the only way
she can help you is by her example --
by trying to be a model for you by
the way she lives her life

Terry smiles
A moment

RON
And that doesnt mean shes supposed
to be a saint either if thats
what youre smiling about

TERRY
I didnt realize I was smiling

RON
You know Terry a lot of people
come to see me with all kinds of
problems Drugs alcohol marital
problems sexual problems health
problems --

TERRY
Great job you got

RON
Well I like it Because even in
this little town I feel like what I
do is very connected with the real
center of peoples lives Im not
saying Im always Mr Effective but
I dont feel like my life is off to
the side of whats important You
know I dont feel my happiness and
comfort are based on closing my eyes
to trouble within myself or trouble
in other people I dont feel like a
negligible little scrap floating
around in some kind of empty void
with no sense of connectedness to
anything around me except by virtue
of whatever little philosophies I
can scrape together on my own

TERRY
Well --

RON
Can I ask you Terry Do you think
your life is important

TERRY
You mean -- Like me personally my
individual life

RON
Yeah
Silence

TERRY
Well Im not sure -- What do you
mean Its important to me I guess
And like to my you know the people
who care about me

RON
But do you think its important

TERRY

RON
Do you think its important in the
scheme of things Not just because
its yours or because youre
somebodys brother Because I dont
really get the impression that you
do

TERRY
Well I dont think I dont
particularly think anybodys life
has any particular importance besides
whatever -- you know -- whatever we
arbitrarily give it Which is fine
I mean we might as well I think
Im as important as anybody else

TERRY
I dont know A lot of what youre
saying has a real appeal to me Ron
A lot of the stuff they told us when
we were kids But I dont want to
believe something or not believe it
because I might feel bad I want to
believe it because I think its true
or not Id like to think that my
life is important Or that its
connected to something important

RON
Well isnt there any way for you to
believe that without calling it God
or religion or whatever term it is
you object to

TERRY
Yes I believe that
