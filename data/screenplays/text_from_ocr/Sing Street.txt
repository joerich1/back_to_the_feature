EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - DUBLIN CITY - MORNING

Two FIFTEEN year-old BOYS stand outside this rough inner
city school on a cold rainy morning They are CONOR and
DARREN Conor is a middle class kid with a posh accent
Darren is a local boy with a tough Dublin accent

They are elbowed by passing STUDENTS entering the school
gates Some of them mince past them implying that they are

gay-
These two are outsiders

Conor will be handsome when he grows up While most of the
other boys have standard issue tight haircuts Conor’s is
long and tousled He sports two black eyes making him look
like a panda Darren has acne buck teeth braces and
bifocals His face is a mess

They are both looking across the road We don’t see at what

CONOR
Who’s she

DARREN
I don’t know She’s always there

CONOR
She’s beautiful

DARREN
Yeah Good luck She doesn’t speak
to anyone Stuck-up cow

CONOR
Who says

DARREN
Ciaran Mackie from third year said
he tried to get her digits

CONOR

(confused)
You mean her number

( )
DARREN
Yeah No luck He said she has a
boyfriend who’s a drug dealer
She’s not interested any of the
boys in the school

CONOR
Oh yeah Why’s she standing there
then

Darren shrugs Conor takes a breath sets off crossing the
road

EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - MORNING

We track with him over his shoulder arriving at a 16 year-
old GIRL who is standing on the stoop of a HOUSE an unlit
cigarette dangling from her purple lips Conor stands in
front of her

She has a great look lots of black Good makeup Back-combed
hair Early ‘80s teen-chic She’s ahead of her time and
anything but ordinary

CONOR

Need a light
GIRL

No I’m trying to give up
CONOR

Cool I don’t have any matches

anyway
Silence He doesn’t go away

CONOR
Why aren’t you at school

GIRL
I don’t go to school
(beat)
I’m a model

CONOR
Cool Like for magazines and
stuff

GIRL
I’m going to London soon Just
waiting for my portfolio shots
There’s no real work for models in
Dublin you know

CONOR
Yeah I know

( )
He thinks

CONOR
Oh yeah I meant to ask- do you
want to be in a video For my band

GIRL
You’re in a band

CONOR
Yes And we need a girl for it
There’s like a story It’s called a
“Story-Board” video You could be
the girl In the story If you’re
free Have you been in a video
before

GIRL
No
(beat)
Is that a problem

CONOR
I hope not I’1ll ask the producer

GIRL
Who’s the producer

CONOR
That kid behind me

She looks over his shoulder pulling onto Darren who waves
nonchalantly

GIRL
When are we shooting I’m pretty
busy

CONOR

Saturday after next I can call you
with the details If I had your
digits

She puts the cigarette away taking out her pen He produces
his journal handing it to her She flicks through it it’s
full of thoughts and drawings

CONOR
Lyrics

RAPHINA
So if you’re in a band sing me a
song

CONOR

I’m not singing here

( )
RAPHINA
What you’ll have to sing in front
of thousands of people I’m just
one Sing

CONOR
What

RAPHINA
Sing anything off the radio

He reluctantly sings a hesitant but tuneful few lines from a
popular song She smiles She writes down her number on the
cover He smiles turning back Score

INT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - MORNING

We track back with him across the street as he approaches
Darren who can’t believe what he’s seen

CONOR
We need to form a band

Freeze Frame A loud energetic punk song crashes in on the
track

SONG and titles run over

TITLE SEQUENCE - MONTAGE

A montage of news stories rock videos magazine covers
headlines Its the early eighties and its Ireland Midway
through the worst recession since the 1950s

TITLE SEQUENCE - MONTAGE

Across the Irish sea in London news reports see Thatcher
waving to the crowds City boys talk into early mobile

telephones getting into sports cars Armani suits and gold
cuff links

TITLE SEQUENCE -— MONTAGE

But back in Ireland bombs in the North petrol queues in the
South Deserted building sites bricked-up buildings More
black and white than London’s Technicolor

INT CONOR’S KITCHEN - DAY

We start to PULL OUT from an old TV set The 9 o’clock news
is on The volume turned down low
INT CONOR’S KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

We find ourselves in a large kitchen High ceilings and
rattling sash windows in what 100 years ago was a fine
Georgian home Now things are a little faded The room is
cold and unwelcoming Very little on the shelves A family on
a budget

Sitting around the kitchen table are Conor (no black eyes
yet) and his parents PENNY and ROBERT both in their mid
forties They’ve just finished a meal of Spag Boll Though
it’s more Spag than Boll Penny fills up her glass of cheap
supermarket wine Robert picks his teeth with a toothpick
He is drinking a whiskey and smoking Penny checks her watch
They are sitting in silence as if waiting for something to
happen Conor is wearing a woolly hat and his coat indoors

ONE MONTH EARLIER

INT CONOR’S KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Finally the sound of someone racing down the stairs from
above The door opens and BRENDAN tumbles into the
room carrying an ash tray glass of wine tobacco pouch
rolling papers and matches He sits down at the vacant seat
beside his brother Brendan has long hair and a moustache
He’s handsome

BRENDAN
This meeting has been called to
order Pray proceed

He lights a cigarette

ROBERT
Okay so we wanted to talk about
finances Penny

PENNY
What Go ahead

BRENDAN
(to his brother)
This is going to be heavy

ROBERT
Well as you might have noticed-
your mother and I are really
struggling at the moment like the
rest of the country I haven’t had
a single commission this year Your
mother is on a three day week It
doesn’t look like it’s going to get
much brighter

( )
He knocks back his drink The kids wait for what’s coming
next

PENNY
So we’ve had a look through the
accounts and we see quite a
significant saving if we were to
alter the education situation

CONOR
What “education situation”

BRENDAN
(intuiting)
He means your school They’re
taking you out of school

CONOR
(excited)
What
ROBERT

Were not taking you out of school
Were transferring you from one
school to another

CONOR
Why

ROBERT
We have to make some cuts to the
budget I’d suggest taking your
brother out of college but he’s
already dropped out of his own
volition

BRENDAN
(raising a glass)
Thank you Dad

CONOR
Cuts I’m already wearing three
jumpers indoors And a hat I read
by candlelight And it’s the 1980s
I’m like Tiny Tim up there

Brendan laughs

ROBERT
Don’t act so entitled I grew up in
a council house with five brothers

BRENDAN
(mock surprised)
Really Tell us about that dad For
the first time ever

( )
PENNY
A school that’s close by So
there’s no transport costs You can
cycle in And you can get lunch
back here There’s two savings
already It’s a non-fee paying

school

ROBERT
Those Jesuits are far too soft on
you anyway

BRENDAN
The Jesuits have a long history of
education

ROBERT

So do the Christian Brothers
Silence

CONOR
Who are the Christian Brothers

BRENDAN
The Christian Brothers Conor are
a order of the Catholic Church
appointed in the education
formation and beating of their
young charges

ROBERT
Oh be quiet Brendan Six years at
the hands of the Jesuits yourself
and look at what they did for you

BRENDAN
Well they didn’t beat me

PENNY
Brendan Cut that out Synge Street
is a perfectly reputable school
Youll settle in in no time

CONOR
You can’t just change in the middle
of the year Just when I’m making
friends and settling in This could
scar me Long-term

ROBERT
Just deal with this Conor You
know what the Christian Brother’s
motto is “Viriliter Age” That
means “Act Manly”

This meeting is over

( )
Brendan gets up He squeezes Conor’s shoulder big brother
style and exits His parents go about their business We
push in on Conor alone

EXT CONOR’S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

The door slams as Conor exits his house zipping up his
jacket He marches down the driveway He wears brown cords
with a slight flare to them Leather shoes Jumper

This is a leafy suburb of Dublin Middle class safe
protected But Conor’s house stands out It has seen better
days It needs a new coat of paint and the garden could do
with a mow A car is parked in the driveway but hasn’t been
used in a good while Three push bikes are leaning against
the gate instead

He walks up the street with his hands in his pockets

EXT JESUIT SCHOOL SPORTS GROUND - DAY

This is a large sports ground in a leafy Jesuit school Nice
red brick buildings very peaceful It’s the weekend and
students are practicing track rugby cricket A big copper
beech tree shades the Cricket Training net

Conor is at the wicket bat in hand Two FRIENDS are playing
with him They all speak with posh South-side accents

CONOR
So guys I’m not coming back after
the break

FRIEND 1

The hell Why

CONOR
The old pair are moving me to a
different school

FRIEND 2
Dicks Why

CONOR
They say they have no money

The ball whizzes past him He misses by a mile throwing down
the bat in frustration They take a break

CONOR
But we still hang out yeah

FRIEND 2
Totally man

( )
CONOR

At weekends and stuff Right
FRIEND 1

Absolutely So where are you going

Conlets
Conor doesn’t respond

FRIEND 2
Gonzaga

CONOR
Synge Street

His friends exchange looks after they see he’s not joking

CONOR
What It can’t be that bad

One of them mock-hugs him

FRIEND 2
Seriously bro it’s been nice
knowing you

His friends laugh We hold on Conor the gravity of his
situation sinking in

INT JESUIT SCHOOL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Conor is sitting in a cosy large office Across from him
his history teacher and headmaster FATHER WAITS (late 50s)
Fr Waits smokes a pipe sitting on the edge of his desk He
is prematurely grey and has a warm understanding
appearance His SECRETARY a heavy woman in her fifties sits
in an anteroom typing off

FATHER WAITS
Well be sorry to be losing you
Synge Street was a fine school in
its day It has a poor reputation
now but I’m sure that’s
exaggerated The Christian Brothers
can be a little tough to my mind
but they get the work done

CONOR
No more rugby No cricket practice
Debating School plays

FATHER WAITS
They’1ll have their own
extracurricular activities I
suspect

( )

CONOR
Yeah like flick knife practice
And corporal punishment

FATHER WAITS
I’m sure that’s not true

CONOR
I’ve heard it is I can’t do
corporal punishment I’m light-
boned

Father Waits laughs Though Conor is wise-cracking he’s
clearly genuinely nervous

Father Waits gets up putting a hand on Conor’s shoulder and
walking him to the door

FATHER WAITS
You’1ll be fine Conor Trust me
You know what’s gotten us to where
we are today us humans One
quality

They pause at the open door

FATHER WAITS
Adaptability

He winks shaking Conor’s hand Conor shuffles off down the
corridor

Father Waits looks over to his secretary who has been
listening He makes a doubtful expression She nods in
agreement

INT CHURCH - DAY

A church on a school campus 30 choir boys are at choir
practice on the alter They are dressed in their own cloths
There is no congregation It’s Saturday rehersal They sing
BACH

We slowly ZOOM in to Conor who is standing on the edges of
the back row He sings but is lost in thought

A TEACHER is conducting them

EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - EVENING

Conor walks past Synge Street School that evening The gates
are open The deserted school looms grey and forboding in the
dusk sky He pushes the gate open and enters looking around
Litter rolls like tumbleweed across the pot-holed yard
Stripped-down bicycle frames remain locked to the outdoor
bike shed Old windows rattle in the wind

( )

The walls read like a tabloid newspaper “IRA” “BRITS OUT”
“JENNY GREEN IS A SLUT ” are among the headlines

The playing field of his previous school is another world

INT BRENDAN’S ROOM - EVENING

Back in his house we are in Brendan’s attic lair As far
away from the rest of the house as possible This small room
is a shrine to music and art And hash

We have numerous ash trays A homemade hammock Posters of
bands on the walls Shelves of books on pop art philosophy
and music A poster of SIGMUND FREUD on the wall next to his
bed A voice bubble has been drawn in saying “It’s all your
mother’s fault”

A portable TV on a box An acoustic guitar with two strings
But most importantly a huge collection of Vinyl Proudly
alphabetized The only thing so in Brendan’s life

The windows are blacked out with hanging blankets and the
lighting is low easy on the eternally stoned eye

Brendan sits in his huge collapsed armchair in a mist of
marijuana smoke a king of his own domain He is taking a
drag from one The door is ajar

Outside Conor knocks

CONOR
You in there

BRENDAN
Where else would I be

CONOR
I don’t know The kitchen

BRENDAN
I’m in here

Conor enters leaning against the wall by the door
BRENDAN
(sage-like)
You appear troubled my young
friend

Conor nods his head

BRENDAN
Sit Share your woes

Conor sits on the edge of his brother’s bed

( )

BRENDAN
You start tomorrow

Conor nods his head

BRENDAN
You’1l be fine You just have to
find a way of distracting the thugs
from noticing you

CONOR
How do I do that

BRENDAN
How would I know

CONOR
I feel like I’m going to prison

BRENDAN
You are In a way All institutions
are prisons You do realize that
this is just part of the bigger
picture This school move

CONOR
How do you mean

BRENDAN
I’m pretty sure they’re splitting
up I hear them rowing in the
middle of the night

CONOR
Do you Why aren’t you asleep

Brendan just laughs at this as if sleep would be ridiculous

BRENDAN
There’1ll be plenty of time for
that

He takes another drag and then instinctively goes to pass it
to Conor But then realizes pulling it back

BRENDAN
Oh no you’re tiny

He stands up taking the record that has been playing
quietly Replaces it carefully and searches for something
else

BRENDAN
and this is just the start of a
process They start moving you
around Soon the electricity will
be cut off The bailiff will come
The house will be sold

(MORE)
( )

The cave is under threat brother
From monsters

Conor is genuinely concerned

CONOR
What monsters

Brendan finds a record that is pertinent opening it and
carefully rubbing his sleeve off the vinyl

BRENDAN
Oh just the three-headed monster
of Fear Infidelity Ego
Materialism

CONOR
That’s a four-headed monster

BRENDAN
The things that are destroying
their marriage And now YOU’RE
being tested This is YOUR time I
had my time

CONOR
And what happened

BRENDAN

(beat a thousand thoughts

in a blink of an eye)
This is a great chance for you To
break that cycle of shit That
school would have turned you into a
doctor or a lawyer “Must make
money must make money”

Conor listens attentively if a little confused

BRENDAN

(off his look of

confusion)
That was a robot I just did there
Who wants to be a robot Except
R2D2 Who knows what this new
prison will do for you my little
friend

(beat)
Youre on a hero’s journey How are
you going to fare

He puts on the record he’s been looking for The needle meets
the vinyl with a comforting crunch A loud heavy metal song
from the late seventies

The room rocks Brendan smiles at his younger brother “you
feeling me”

( )

Hard cut
EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - MORNING
Song playing loud

Monday morning Almost in answer to his brother’s question
Conor walks into the gate of the school Numerous kids have
gathered in packs Conor has to walk a gauntlet of new faces
Heads turn towards the newcomer There is something of a
stranger arriving at a new town in a Western But this is no
Western and the stomping song tells us so Conor’s three-
quarter length smart coat and long curly hair draws laughs
He is also carrying a soft brown leather satchel which
doesn’t help

Kids smoke in circles Kids spit on the ground

Further into the walk a fight is just breaking out anda
small circle is gathering Two boys beat it out Bloody noses
and fists Conor speeds up as he passes He notices that
above them at a second story window a BROTHER (50s) in
black suit and white collar is watching the fight down
below He does nothing about it

One KID has a dead RAT skewered on the end of a stick He
chases other kids around with it He finally throws it at
Conor It hits him on the side of the head Others laugh

The song ends as he enters the school The back of his coat
is covered in spit

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

Conor sits in a large drafty classroom looking around The
windows rattle in the wind Worn wooden floorboards
underfoot The desks are mismatched Two kids per desk This
is a class of about 35 kids

BROTHER BARNABAS in a black gown and white collar
writes Latin on the blackboard

Even with his hearing aid he can’t hear kids chatting
laughing and fighting when his back is turned

Conor sits in the middle amazed To his left at the back of
class a boy smokes a cigarette blowing the smoke out the
sash window beside him

To his right two BOYS hold down another as a fourth farts
in his mouth closing it and making him swallow

Another kid is getting an Indian ink tattoo IRA on his
hand

( )

At the blackboard Brother Barnabas takes a surreptitious
swig from a hip flask returning it under his gown This old
guy should have been put out to pasture a long time ago

The door swings open and the HEADMASTER enters silently on
his morning rounds The class stands up Silence He is the
same Brother we saw watching the fight on the way in

CLASS
(as one)
Good morning Brother Baxter

Brother Baxter surveys the room landing on the blackboard

BROTHER BAXTER
Its French brother Barnabas

BROTHER BARNABAS
Hah

BROTHER BAXTER
Youre teaching French Not Latin

Brother Barnabas looks at the board seeing that he is
teaching Latin

BROTHER BARNABAS
Oh How modern

Brother Baxter speaks in a tough no nonsense Dublin accent
His bushy moustache suggests something of a military man

BROTHER BAXTER
Mind you Id be surprised if any
of ye even knew where France is
not to mind speaking the language

Silence Conor who thinks this is an actual question
raises a hand

BROTHER BAXTER
Oh Go on

CONOR
On the continent Above Spain

BROTHER BAXTER
My my And how do you know that

CONOR
My parents took us there One
summer In the car

Other kids laugh jealously
BROTHER BAXTER
Youll be the new lad then from

the Jesuits

( )

CONOR
Yes

BROTHER BAXTER
Yes “Brother” What’s your name

CONOR
Conor Lawlor

Laughter Conor looks around all eyes on him Brother Baxter
is impressed

BROTHER BAXTER
Shut up You could all take a leaf
out of his book Look at a map once
in a while Right Conor Morning
prayers are at a quarter to nine
Little break is ten minutes At 11
oclock Big break is 45 minutes at
1 o’clock The canteen is located
below the PE Hall They serve
chips and bars The lads will show
you the ropes Welcome

CONOR
Thank you

BROTHER BAXTER
As you were

He turns to go But as he does he sees Conor’s feet under
his desk He pauses Conor is wearing brown leather brogues
Everyone else is wearing black shoes

BROTHER BAXTER
We have a strict black shoe policy
here Mr Lawlor Your parents
should have read it in the
introductory rule book Page 142
Well let it go today but from
tomorrow on

He goes to exit again

CONOR
I don’t have black shoes Sir

Brother Baxter pauses at the door The class goes silent BB
is not used to being questioned like this

BROTHER BAXTER
Well you’ll have to get a pair
then And report to me first thing
in the morning with them Good man

Brother Baxter exits The class takes a sigh of relief The
kid who was smoking releases a lung-full of smoke Brother
Barnabas goes back to teaching Latin

( )

Conor leans into the BOY sitting next to him MICK MAHON a
really tough kid with a buzz cut and a gold stud earring

CONOR
Sorry but where did he say the
restaurant was

MICK MAHON
The wha

CONOR
The restaurant The cafeteria

MICK MAHON
You mean the canteen

CONOR
Yeah Of course

Mick just shakes his head in amazement

MICK MAHON
The “restaurant” You’re not in
France now you bleedin spanner

EXT SYNGE STREET YARD - DAY
Little break

Kids play football with a punctured football Others sit on
walls eating sweets Conor wanders about on his own looking
for the canteen He passes by the alleyway towards the PE
hall From behind the bike sheds a low whistle catches his
attention

Down the alley way is a 15 year-old He has a cigarette in
his hand He has a skin head His uniform is dirty and too
short for him He wears scuffed loafers and a green bomber
jacket

KID
Do you smoke do you

CONOR
Oh Occasionally I’m not really a
smoker My brother is and I
sometimes take a little of his
tobacco if my friends are over
And my dad used to smoke a pipe
But he gave up

KID
Why are you telling me all this
Come on and we’ll have a smoke
Follow me

( )

Conor follows the kid who enters a prefab marked TOILETS

INT THE BOY’S TOILET’S (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

This is a stinking prefabricated building with a row of
urinals across from three cubicles The floor is sticky and
wet Conor follows the KID in

He puts a cigarette in his mouth

KID
D’you want one

CONOR
Nah I’m okay I’11 just watch you
I’ve already had a couple this
morning

The kid pulls a Black Widow catapult from inside his bomber
jacket and a large marble

KID
Did you ever see one these did
you

He loads it with the marble and points it at Conor’s head

KID
I hear you’re a queer

CONOR
What

KID
I hear you’re a little queer

CONOR
No You must have me mixed up with
someone else

KID
(scrutinizing him)
I don’t think so Dance

CONOR
What

KID
Dance Like a queer

Conor doesn’t know how to deal with this

CONOR
Are you serious

The kid aims the catapult at a light bulb and fires hitting
it perfectly re-loading and pointing it back at Conor

( )

Conor starts a merry jig The KID watches for a while his
catapult ready

KID

Now dance with your pants down
CONOR

What
KID

Get into that cubicle And dance
with your pants down

Conor stops dancing

CONOR
No

KID
What did you just say

CONOR
No I’m not doing that

Silence To his surprise the kid disarms his catapult

KID
Okay Bye Bye

Conor walks past him exiting hurriedly baffled

INT THE CANTEEN (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Conor is in a basement building No windows It’s lit with
fluorescent lights Kids of all ages muck about There’s a
ping pong table with no net or bats There’s a tuck shop with
candy bars and a dinner lady deep frying chips at a window
Music plays through a small ghetto blaster Many kids are
smoking

Conor heads for the tuck shop window joining a rowdy queue
while searching for enough change in his pockets

He manages to get 25 pence together and exchanges it for a
Mars bar As he turns to exit the KID from the toilet is
standing right behind him He taps him on the shoulder Conor
turns around

People watch on knowing that something is brewing

The KID lets Conor have it right on the eye It’s a good
shot People wince Conor goes down on the ground

The KID picks up Conor’s Mars Bar and rips it open takes a
bite and throws away the rest He turns and swaggers off
People clear the way from him keeping their distance

( )

The bell rings and everyone starts to shuffle off back to
class some of them step over Conor laughing

As the room empties out we hear a voice off

VOICE
You should’ve just danced

Conor looks over his shoulder DARREN (who we met in the pre-
title scene) is crossing over towards him putting on his
jacket

EXT SYNGE STREET YARD (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Conor now in the company of Darren walks back towards his
classroom holding his eye

CONOR
So you were there In the toilets

DARREN
Ive a touch of the scutters So I
was in one of the cubicles all
morning with the liquid shits

He smiles

DARREN
Darren’s the name

He goes to shake hands Conor take his hand hiding his
reluctance

CONOR
Conor Who is that psycho

DARREN
That’s Barry Bray He eats hair
gel

CONOR
What

DARREN

Yeah He ate a pot of hair gel in
class once No one knows why

The only problem now is he’1ll be
out for your blood

CONOR
Why

DARREN
Because you’ve shown weakness

CONOR
How do you know him

( )

We hold on Conor looking increasingly worried Synge Street
is certainly living up to its reputation

DARREN
He lives in the same flats as me
His ma and da are mad drug addicts
People say he was conceived on
acid And it got into his
bloodstream But don’t worry you
just need to come up with a plan
for the year A solution Here

He hands him a slip of paper from a plastic wallet It reads
in marker

Darren Mulvey Business solutions
Saint Teresas Gardens Flat 221
“Your problem is my solution

DARREN
Call me any time

CONOR
There’s no number on it

DARREN
No we don’t have a phone Just
call around

They arrive outside Conor’s class

CONOR
This is my class Where are you

DARREN
Ah they kept me back a year Or
two I can’t really read very well

CONOR
Right How’s that going to work in
business

DARREN

(leaning in)
I can read people And you’re
alright But you won’t survive in
here unless we deal with Barry

CONOR
What about telling the Brothers

DARREN
Hah You could do that yeah

Darren heads off laughing

( )

Conor heads back into class The door slams behind him with a
menacing “SLAM”

INT CONOR’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Penny stands in the hallway shouting upstairs

PENNY
Bren Conor It’s on

Brendan exits his room quickly He is carrying his drinking
and smoking accoutrements He passes Conor’s door as Conor
exits The two of them run downstairs It’s like a fire
drill

INT THE SITTING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Brendan and Conor burst into the sitting room Their father
is sitting at the table drinking a whiskey The collar of his
jacket is turned up and he has a scarf on In front of him
a few architectural drawings draftsman kit sliding rule
etc He is sketching plans for a building that will never be
built

Numerous photographs of Brendan are framed and around the
place As a baby A young boy A handsome teenager Etc
Brendan was the golden boy

Brendan turns on the TV as he and Conor take seats on the
couch

BRENDAN
Can we turn on the fire

ROBERT

TV PRESENTER
(off)
It’s Thursday It’s 7 o’clock It’s
Top of The Pops

Penny enters sitting across from her husband drinking a
coffee She is wearing a big cardigan

As the charts countdown for January starts they are a
family Sort of

VOICE ON TV
“They can’t be here tonight as
they’re in the USA so instead we
have to go to RIO It’s Duran
Duran”

( )

On the TV the video for Duran Duran’s “Rio” begins Conor is
glued to the screen as Brendan lectures on the clothes
video song and lyrics Conor is an enthusiastic student

BRENDAN

The jury is out on which way these
guys will go They’re a lot of fun
and John Taylor is one of the most
proficient bass players in the UK
right now giving them a funky edge
which I hope they’1ll go with Look
at this video

He laughs with glee as beautiful people aboard a yacht in the
Caribbean surround Simon LeBon The band looks good The
girls are clad in bikinis

At the table Robert looks back at his sketch He scrunches
up the sheets of paper angrily Frustrated Penny watches
this

ROBERT
Who am I kidding Nothing’s getting
built here for another ten years at
least

PENNY
You don’t know that

He laughs pouring a whiskey and turning towards the TV

ROBERT
Not exactly the Beatles is it

BRENDAN
Oh I’1l1 just start up the time
machine so we can go BACK in time
for dad

He sighs Underwater Simon LeBon drinks a pink cocktail
underwater The pink liquid mixes with the sea Brendan
laughs

ROBERT
Well if that’s the future we’re all
screwed Look at him he’s not even
singing live

BRENDAN
It’s a video Robert It’s a piece
of art Everyone is making them
now

CONOR
Yeah Robert

( )

PENNY
(referring to Simon)
He’s very attractive isn’t he

ROBERT
You’re welcome to him

PENNY
Do you promise

On screen a guy in the video plays a saxophone solo on a
raft

CONOR
Wow a saxophone solo

BRENDAN
That might date

ROBERT
Why can’t they get them to play
live What are they hiding

BRENDAN
Because they’re in the USA didn’t
you hear him And this lasts
forever It’s the perfect marriage
of music and visuals Short To the
point Look at that

He points to the screen Hedonism and fun in Technicolor

BRENDAN
What tyranny could stand up to
that

Conor looks at the screen transfixed His brother has a
point Sort of

ROBERT
That’s because this is the tyranny

BRENDAN
Oh let’s not begin a philosophical
argument Robert

ROBERT
Why not

BRENDAN
Because you’1ll lose

This winds Robert up who is up for a fight but a stern
shake of Penny’s head warns him off

( )

BRENDAN
(quietly)
-and the thing about Barry Bray
is he’s probably a victim himself
Bullying is a cycle Like with Dad
His dad undermined him pissed on
his dreams So what do you expect

CONOR
Right

BRENDAN
So we gotta break the cycle Right
Look at these guys-
(referring to the band)
Their dads fought in the Second
World War Wore flat caps and
woolen underwear Look at them now

On screen Duran Duran are the epitome of ‘80s London
affluence arrogance and renewed confidence

BRENDAN
Barry Bray is more than likely
gay And he’s struggling with it
And holding you up in the toilets
is all part of that

CONOR
Really

BRENDAN
Probably It’s not a good school to
be gay in he’s suffering in there
same as you But the only way to
get him off your back is to
understand him To defeat him you
must firstly forgive him

He nods sagely returning to watching the TV We hold on
Conor thinking about this advice
EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL GATE - DAY

Conor walks into school He is keeping a low profile walking
in by the wall as the madness carries on all around him

Up ahead he runs into Brother Baxter He looks him up and
down We TILT down to reveal BROWN SHOES

Hold on Brother Baxter’s face An inscrutable look Deep
shock that his warning would be ignored

INT BROTHER BAXTER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Brother Baxter sits behind his large desk in his office Very
little in this room except a statue of the Virgin Mary and
a cross On the other side of the desk Conor

Silence

BROTHER BAXTER
What’s going on son

CONOR
About the shoes

Brother Baxter just nods

CONOR
Well I brought it up with my mum
But she said we couldn’t afford
another pair of shoes at the
moment I bought these before I
knew about the shoe colour policy
here at Synge Street But it’s not
as if these are runners or
something They’re brown They’re
quite sensible

BROTHER BAXTER
I can see that They’re very nice
Tasteful as you say But you see
they’re not black

CONOR
I’m not sure What you want me to
do They’re shoes They keep the
rain out

BROTHER BAXTER
(nodding his head)
Take them off

CONOR
What

BROTHER BAXTER
Seeing as you’re so fond of them
You can pick them up here at four
oclock every day until you comply
with the rules of the school

Conor looks at him in disbelief Is this really what’s going
to happen now
INT THE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Close on a pair of stockinged feet Conor walks down the
corridor in his socks Kids laugh What is going on

EXT THE YARD - LATER

Now Conor walks through puddles in the yard His socks are
already developing holes

INT ART CLASS - LATER

Conor sits in art class This class is made up of about
twelve kids Including Conor There’s some interesting art on
the walls Conor rubs his feet together trying to keep warm

MISS DUNNE (40s) sits on the corner of her desk She has a
curvy figure and a mane of dyed blonde hair She has a
Dublin accent She has a scented candle lit on her desk A
few flowers in a glass

MISS DUNNE
Right so most of yiz picked this
class because ye didn’t wanna do
mechanical drawing Am I right

Most people nod

MISS DUNNE
Yiz think art class will be a
doddle A chance to get a break in
the day and scribble a few pictures
in between other classes

A few lads nod in agreement

MISS DUNNE
Right well you’re not completely
off the mark

This gets a little laugh

MISS DUNNE
Art should be a break from the rest
of the world It should never be
work It’s kind of therapy But
don’t think you’re not going to
learn something in here I’m going
to impart some information to ye
okay So when you’re out with a
girl at the National Gallery you
can look at a painting and SAY
something about it Okay

A few nods and mutterings of acceptance Mick Mahon puts his
hand up

MICK MAHON

I’1l take you on a date to the
National Gallery any day miss

( )

MISS DUNNE
Ah thanks Michael But I have a
fiance already

MICK MAHON
Are you sure

MISS DUNNE
Positive

She puts on her glasses to get a closer look at Conor’s feet
under his desk

MISS DUNNE
What the hell is going on here

CONOR
Oh I don’t have black shoes So I
have to leave my brown ones in
Brother Baxter’s office every day
until I get some

She shakes her head

INT THE CANTEEN - LATER

Conor enters the canteen in his bare feet He looks around

Up ahead in a little group he sees Barry He musters up the
courage and approaches tapping him on the shoulder Barry

Bray turns around

Other kids notice this

CONOR
Hey I understand that you’re in
pain That there is a conflict
within you And that can’t be easy
to deal with in this school You
publicly humiliated me So now I
publicly forgive you Barry Bray

EXT THE SCHOOL - MORNING

Conor now has the TWO black eyes of the opening scene Darren
stands beside him

He marches off towards the GIRL across the street We hold on
Darren this time In a few moments Conor returns

CONOR
We need to form a band

EXT A SMALL COTTAGE - DAY

Conor and Darren stand at the front door of a small run-down
cottage on a narrow lane way They are not wearing their
school uniforms It’s out of school

Darren knocks on the knocker

DARREN
Eamon’s a genius He can play every
instrument known to man His hobby
is rabbits

After a while we hear footsteps thundering down the stairs
The door opens and EAMON stands there Eamon wears
stone-washed denims matching DENIM () jacket a crew neck
jumper and white dirty boot runners

He has curly hair and wears steel-rim glasses He sports a
wicked mullet

DARREN
Hey Eamon What you doing

EAMON
Nothing I was just feeding me new
bunny Howareya Darren

DARREN
Cool This is Eamon Eamon this is
Conor He’s new in the school and
he’s putting together a band

EAMON
So

INT EAMON’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Eamon’s small living room has been transformed into a band-
rehersal space In a semicircle in the corner of the room is
a drum kit guitar amp keyboard and microphone Conor looks
about impressed

CONOR
Wow Where did you get all this
gear

EAMON

Me da’s in a covers band Weddings
parties pubs

Close up on the logo on the kick drum “EAZY LIVIN’” with
some glittery stars

DARREN
Eamon can play every instrument
known to man can’t you Eamon

( )

EAMON
Probably

DARREN
Show him

FOUR VERY QUICK SHOTS Eamon plays the bass guitar slapping
The drums The guitar soloing And the keyboard playing
jazz

CONOR
Wow So

But Eamon isn’t finished

SIX more very quick shots Eamon is playing an African
Balaphone Next he’s playing an Indian flute Then the
Uilleann pipes Then a shaker Then a Conga drum

Finally he is done He’s clearly something of a prodigy

EAMON
What do you play yourself

CONOR
(thinking on his feet)
I’m more of a singer

Eamon waits for him to go on

CONOR
And I write songs Well I mean
lyrics Words But I haven’t put
them to music yet

EAMON
So what do yous want from me

DARREN
We want to hire your instruments

CONOR
(interrupting)
No way You’ve got to be IN the
band You’re amazing Right Darren

DARREN
Are you into that Eamon

We can see that Eamon is very glad to be asked but bluffs a
little

EAMON
What kind of music are you going to
be doing

CONOR
I don’t know yet

( )

EAMON
You have to know what you’re going
to play What are you into

CONOR
I’m a futurist

EAMON
What does that mean

CONOR
Like no nostalgia Not like your
dad’s band Not looking backwards
Just forwards

EAMON
Cool Like Depeche Mode

CONOR
(not knowing them)
Okay

EAMON
Or Joy Division

CONOR
(bluffing)
Right

Eamon sure knows his stuff

EAMON
Or Duran Duran What do you think
of them

CONOR

(beat then parroting

Brendan)
The jury is out on which way those
guys will go They’re a lot of fun
and James Taylor is one of the most
proficient bass players in the UK
right now giving them a funky
edge

Silence Eamon is impressed even though Conor has got John
Taylor’s name wrong

EAMON
JOHN Taylor

CONOR
Yea John Of course

They stand there sizing each other up

( )

EAMON
I’1l be in the band I’1l1 play
guitar And help write the songs
We can rehearse here because me
da’s in Saint John Of Gods

DARREN
Is that a pub

EAMON
No Darren It’s where alcoholics
go to get off drink and stop
beating up their wives and kids

DARREN
Right

EAMON
And neighbors

CONOR
Okay

EAMON

And the police

INT EAMON’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Conor Eamon and Darren sit around the kitchen table
continuing their plans

Eamon’s MOTHER is pouring Cup-O-Soup into three bowls
in front of them and giving them slices of bread Eamon is
stroking a bunny on his knee

EAMON

Who’s going to be the manager
DARREN

Me
EAMON

Have you managed bands before

DARREN
No (thinks) I’m just breaking into
the market

EAMON
Nice How are we going to cut
things up

DARREN

Ill draw up contracts

EAMON’S MUM
Do you need a pen

( )

EAMON
Ma we are trying to have a band
meeting here

She smiles as she pours

EAMON
Gotta have everything straight
first Get everything down on
paper Otherwise you can get ripped
off by the big record labels when
they come a huntin’ That’s what me
dad says

Eamon’s mum laughs conspicuously

EAMON
When do you want to rehearse

EAMON’S MUM
Not the weekends He’s got a job
packing shelves in Quinnsworth on
Saturdays You’re not leaving that
job Not for any jaysis band

CONOR
How about Mondays and Wednesdays
after school

EAMON
Sounds good

EAMON’S MUM
That’s fine

DARREN
Now all we need is other musicians
Do either of you know any other
musicians

CONOR
No You

DARREN
No Eamon

EAMON’S MUM
He usually just plays on his own
don’t you son

She squeezes his shoulder

EAMON
Right we can’t get any peace here
Let’s continue this meeting out the
back

They get up following Eamon out back
( )

EAMON’S MUM
No smoking now
EAMON
Ma How many times do I have to

tell you I don’t smoke

They exit

INT A SHED - MOMENTS LATER

The three of them stand in a VERY small shed They are all
smoking They are continuing their plans

From the window at the kitchen where Eamon’s mum is washing
up she can plainly see smoke wafting out the window She
shrugs

Darren clicks his fingers

DARREN

There’s a black guy in 3B
EAMON

So
DARREN

Be cool if he was in the band
CONOR

Why
DARREN

He’s the one colored guy in the
whole school Probably in Dublin
Having a Golliwog in the band would
give us a real edge

CONOR
You can’t say Golliwog

DARREN
Why not

CONOR
Trust me You just can’t

Darren looks to Eamon for this Eamon shakes his head
agreeing with Conor Darren shrugs

CONOR
Anyway what if he can’t play
anything

DARREN
He’ll be able to play something
He’s black

( )

Close on a FLYER up on a notice board in school It reads

we have them Influences include

EXT A HOUSE ON A HOUSING ESTATE - DAY

Conor Eamon and Darren knock on the door of a small house on
a shitty housing estate In a moment an enormous beautiful
woman answers the door She speaks in a strong Nigerian
accent wearing colorful headgear and dress They’ve never
seen anything like it

EAMON
Wow

WOMAN (EARLY 30S)
Can I help you

DARREN
Is this the house where the colored
lad lives

WOMAN
What do you think How many black
people do you think live on this
shitting estate
(beat)
Do you know Ngig

DARREN
What is that

WOMAN
My son Do you know my son

CONOR
No But we’re in his school And
were putting a band together Does
he play any instruments

WOMAN
(opening the door wider)
Why don’t you ask him yourself
They enter

DARREN
Does he speak English

INT NGIG’S SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The three lads stand in a small tidy living space In front
of them NGIG a black kid stocky well built

DARREN
(very slowly)
WE-ARE-PUTTING-A-BAND-TOGETHER I-
AM-THE-MANAGER

NGIG
What the hell is wrong with him

When he speaks he speaks in a tough inner city Dublin
accent

DARREN
Oh You sound different from your
ma

NGIG

‘Course I do I’ve been here half
me bleedin life What did you
expect

CONOR
Would you have any interest in
being in a band

He clearly is

NGIG
Maybe What kind of music are yous
playing

EAMON

We’re not 100 percent sure yet But
do you play any instruments

He is about to shake his head when his mother interrupts

NGIG’S MOTHER
Of course he does He’s black

Ngig looks doubtfully at his ma She nods her head

Music starts up on the track It’s sketchy out of time but
vaguely recognizable It’s a bad cover version of RIO by
Duran Duran

INT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

Song over

TRACK out from the flier Two KIDS are writing down the

number from the flier on the wall They are identical twin
rhythm section GARRY and LARRY ( )

It is hard to read the number as the poster is covered in an
array of Spunking Dick drawings

INT EAMON’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Conor sings into a microphone Eamon plays rhythm guitar
Garry fingers a bass guitar His twin brother Larry sits
behind the drum kit Ngig cycles through sounds on an early
synthesizer He has no real idea what he’s doing

Conor is hesitant and nervous Though he can sing he has
zero presence

It’s chaos They are all dressed in their school uniforms and
look awful

TRACK down to find a tape casette recorder on a chair in the
middle of them It is RECORDING

The song ends

NGIG
Not bad

GARRY
Sounds great

NGIG
I think we sped up a little

EAMON
Really We were shit

LARRY
Yeah it’s a shit song We should
be a metal band

CONOR
It’s not the song It’s us
It was all over the place Let’s
try it again

LARRY
Smoke break

EAMON
What

NIGIG

Cool I’m gasping for a smoke
They all run out

Eamon sighs looking at Conor the only other one who hasn’t
left his station
INT THE SHED - MOMENTS LATER

ALL of the band are crammed into the shed smoking

NGIG
So what are we called
They think
EAMON
The Rabbits
NGIG
What is wrong with you and
Rabbits
EAMON

I just love them So fluffy Those
ears Not a dog Yet not quite a
cat And manageable shit Just the
perfect pet

CONOR
I have an idea What about “La
Vie”
Silence Darren looks at him witheringly

DARREN
What does that mean

CONOR
It French for “The Life”

GARRY
What’s French for “That’s not going
to be the name of the band”
CONOR
(beat)
“C’est nes pas le nom du groupe”

GARRY
Right There you go

EAMON
What about Sing Street

They think about this Not bad
CONOR
I like that
INT BRENDAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Song continues

( )

Pull out from Brendan’s tape machine Conor is playing his
brother his first demo tape The tape reads “SING STREET”
DEMO 1 If it sounded bad live this afternoon it sounds
worse played back on a small tape machine

Conor chews his nails in anticipation of his big brothers
response Brendan finally ejects the tape before it’s over

BRENDAN
This is BAD And there’s nothing as
bad as bad music And you must
never play this again

To Conors surprise he begins unspooling the tape pulling
it out in a pile at his feet

CONOR
You know you can record over tapes

BRENDAN
No no All evidence of this day
must be destroyed

He finally bins the tape

BRENDAN
That’s a novelty act You want to
get the girl right

CONOR
What

BRENDAN
(shouting impatient)
The Girl That’s what this is
about Right

CONOR
(thinking)
Oh Yes The girl Right Okay

BRENDAN
Right So you’re going to get her
with someone else’s art Are you
kidding me

CONOR
I suppose But we’re just starting
out We need to learn how to play

BRENDAN
Play PLAY You don’t need to know
how to play You think the Sex
Pistols knew how to play Who are
you Steely Dan

( )

Brendan is coming into his own He leaves his chair pacing
the room Pulling different records from his collection He
now has the first project of his adult life his brother

BRENDAN
You have to learn how to NOT play
That’s rock n roll And that takes
practice
(beat)
And you’re not a covers band

CONOR
Really

BRENDAN
Every school has a covers band
Every wedding Every pub And in
every covers band there’s a middle
aged man who never knows if he
could have made it because he never
had the balls to write a song for
someone Rock n Roll is a risk You
risk being ridiculed

Conor thinks about this

CONOR
I don’t know how to write a song

Brendan now has a large pile of records in his arms He
points at the door

BRENDAN
Close the door And sit down
CONOR
Really I have school in the
morning
BRENDAN

THIS is school

Conor closes the door Sits down It’s going to be a long
night

DISSOLVE TO
SONG 1

A song is formed

INT EAMON’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Conor and Eamon are alone in the rehearsal room Conor
reading from a little notebook of scrawled thoughts and
pictures Eamon sits on the edge of the couch with an
acoustic guitar

( )

CONOR
(reading)
“Well she’s standing on the corner
Like an angel in disguise And I
want to try and warn her but She’s
got dangerous eyes”

EAMON
Dangerous eyes I like that What
does that mean

CONOR
I don’t know

EAMON
What’s this song about Conor

CONOR
It’s like when you don’t know
someone they’re more interesting
They can be anything you want them
to be It’s like you know them
better when you don’t know them
You know

EAMON
No that doesn’t make any sense
What’s it called

CONOR

“The Riddle of the model”
EAMON

Epic What about a rhythm like

this
Eamon plays a chord A funky rhythm

CONOR
Nice Slow it down a little

Conor tries this lyric over it Eamon drops to an F and it
starts to sound like something They smile at the change
Conor takes out a pen from his school bag adding a lyric as
Eamon continues to play

We start to see how this might work- Conor the
directorlyricistvisionary Eamon the pragmatic musical

prodigy

The sound of their first song coming together plays over the
following scenes Just guitar and voice for now

INT IRISH CLASS - DAY

Song over

( )

Conor sits at the back of Irish class The TEACHER reads PEIG
SAYERS while sitting behind his desk Conor writes feverishly
in his notebook looking out the window for inspiration The
teacher calls a BOY up to his desk and slaps him really
hard across the face

( SCENE 41 INTENTIONALLY DELETED )

INT CONOR’S BEDROOM - DAY

Conor writes in his bed His parents rowing on the corridor
off

ROBERT
(off muffled)
That’s funny coming from you

PENNY
Keep your bloody voice down

Two doors slam separately He listens out then continues
writing

INT EAMON’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Song over

The song is really coming together as Conor and Eamon jam
it Though complete opposites this combination of
songwriters is coming together Through the window behind
them the rest of the band are playing football in the
garden Conor taps on the window waving at them to come in
and give it a spin They run in

INT EAMON’S LIVING ROOM - LATER
Now the FULL band play the song And it sounds pretty good
Conor is still a little shy of his own voice and is frozen

at the microphone

Eamon gestures for him to enjoy it But he just smiles and
stays static

Again the tape recorder records it on the chair in the
middle of them

EXT SYNGE STREET - MORNING

Song over

The song plays over as Conor walks across the street From

his satchel he produces a casette tape as he meets the GIRL
standing on her stoop smoking He hands her the tape

( )

GIRL
What’s this now

CONOR
That’s the song I mentioned it to
you

GIRL
Oh yeah The song You’re the kid
in the band That’s cool

CONOR
You should probably learn the
lyrics So you can lip sync We’re
shooting down the lane at the back
of Quinnsworth This Saturday At
12 o’clock See you there

He nods not waiting for a response She blows smoke
watching him go Then she looks at the tape in her hand

EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - NIGHT

By moonlight Conor Darren and Eamon peel back a sheet of
corrugated metal at the back of school This allows them a
gap to slip through into the yard

EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - NIGHT

Darren opens a little back door with a key They are in

INT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The three of them sneak down a basement corridor Conor
guides them with a clunky bicycle lamp They arrive at a
door A handwritten sign says “Audio Visual Room”

Darren tries numerous keys until he gets the right one They
open it

DARREN
(with the flair of a
master criminal)
Gentlemen I give you the Audio
Visual Department

INT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - THE AUDIO VISUAL ROOM - NIGHT

This is hardly a room at all More like a broom closet
Conor’s torch reveals a steel shelving unit bare except for
the camera and VCR machine on the top shelf And three or

four VHS tapes

They start taking it down

EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - NIGHT

The three of them run back across the road by moonlight

laughing

Music plays over

EXT A LANE-WAY - MORNING

The band
They are
Piles of
overcast

are setting up their instruments on a rainy morning
down a little laneway at the back of a row of shops
rubbish old bins and an abandoned car It’s

and depressing And cold

Their guitar amps and drum kit look pretty small out in the

open

Conor is

EAMON
It looks like loads of gear back
home doesn’t it And yet it looks
shit here

setting up the video camera across from them on a

tripod He looks through the viewfinder It does look shit

He checks his watch

DARREN
Where is this chick

CONOR
(worried)
I don’t know

DARREN
Did everyone bring some clothes

They start rooting through plastic bags stuffed with clothes
from home

Larry holds up a pair of flares Garry a child’s cowboy

outfit

DARREN
Who the hell brought a cowboy
outfit

GARRY

Me It’s all I could find

DARREN
No one dresses as a cowboy in a
band

LARRY
There’s a cowboy in The Village
People

( )

GARRY
Yeah And Adam Ant

EAMON
Adam Ant is a highway man

LARRY
So we can have a highway man but
not a cowboy Are you mentally ill

GARRY
So what did you bring then

Hard cut
EXT LANEWAY - MORNING

Conor is dressed as a low-budget New Romantic A mash-up of
ideas from a cross section of TV Nothing quite works He’s
wearing sunglasses bangles his father’s long overcoat with
the sleeves rolled up and a blouse that definitely belongs
to his mum

Eamon is dressed in his Dad’s show-band uniform A purple
velvet suit that is way too big for him He’s a little Austin
Powers

EAMON
It’s me Da’s showband outfit

Garry Larry and Ngig are unimpressed Darren isn’t sure

GARRY
Is this a gay band

CONOR
Coming from the one who wants to
look like The Village People

GARRY
What’s gay about The Village
People

As the others squabble Conor’s attention is drawn to the end
of the lane where Raphina has just appeared

He smiles She approaches carrying a large bag She looks
great in a huge Angora sweater pencil skirt and high heels

RAPHINA
Hello all Sorry I’m late I was
out last night At a night club
Still recovering

She takes off her sunglasses dramatically looking them up
and down

( )
RAPHINA
Jesus Christ What in God’s name
are ye all wearing

CONOR
Yeah we’re just working that out
Maybe you can help

RAPHINA
Who’s your wardrobe person Stevie
Wonder

CONOR
We don’t have a wardrobe person

RAPHINA
Right Who’s the camera man Maybe
he can make some of this work

CONOR
Em We don’t really have

DARREN
I’m the camera man

RAPHINA
I thought you were the producer

DARREN
AND camera man Saving money all
the way

Conor takes her by the elbow walking her out of earshot a

little

CONOR
What did you think of the song

RAPHINA
I liked it It’s the only reason
I’m here Did you write it

CONOR
Pretty much Eamon wrote most of
the music

RAPHINA
So you wrote the lyrics They’re
cool Who are they about

CONOR
Just a girl I see her about

RAPHINA
You know you’ve got really good
cheek bones

( )

CONOR
What
RAPHINA
Yeah Look at you Can I do your
makeup
CONOR
Really
RAPHINA

Yeah This light is going to be
really harsh on camera You should
totally take the edge off it I’m
actually wearing some make up right
now

She’s wearing alot of makeup

RAPHINA
In fact guys You should ALL wear
makeup

The band turn around

DARREN
Let’s get one thing straight I am
NOT wearing any makeup

RAPHINA
Relax You’re not even in the band

DARREN
Yeah thank God

GARRY
I am in the band And yet I’m not
wearing makeup

RAPHINA
Why not You’ve got great lips

GARRY
Piss off would you

RAPHINA
Whatever Those who actually care
about how their band look and want
to do this half-properly queue
over here

GARRY
Who’s saying we don’t care about
the band This band is my life

DARREN
Youve been in it for three days

( )

EAMON
Alright stop rowing

GARRY
Bitch

Raphina sets up her stall on a rubbish bin taking out her
makeup kit Conor sits down on an upturned box and she begins
applying his make up

GARRY
Who is this chick anyway She’s
here two minutes and she’s
threatening to break the band up

EAMON
Shut up Garry

GARRY
Bleedin Yoko Ono

EXT LANEWAY - MORNING

All of the band are now wearing makeup It’s a little full-
on but they look sort of cool

Conor directs Darren as to what the shot will be referring
to his notebook Darren looks through the viewfinder

CONOR
Okay so we’re playing here
Raphina is standing over there
against the wall I go up to her
Start singing to her Make sure to
pan up to her eyes when I sing
“She’s got Dangerous eyes”

DARREN
I think a zoom would be better

CONOR
Okay A zoom whatever

RAPHINA
What if I have little lightening
flashes on my eye lids when I close
them

CONOR
Can you do that

RAPHINA
I can try

CONOR
Cool So then for the chorus you
walk off and I follow

(MORE)
( )

Circling you like when he’s
following her in Thriller Do you
think you can keep the camera
steady Darren

DARREN
What do you think

CONOR
Okay so then I follow her up the
lane Keeping behind her Then
we’ll go around and get that angle
in front

DARREN
Love it

EXT LANEWAY - MOMENT’S LATER

Conor presses PLAY on the tape machine It is plugged into a
small speaker He signals to Darren to start filming Then
runs back to the band who have started miming to the song

Raphina is standing against the wall Conor approaches her
Darren following

Conor starts lip syncing to the song

CONOR
“Well she’s standing on the corner
Like an angel in disguise And Id
really like to warn her But she’s
got dangerous eyes”

Darren crash zooms into her eyes Raphina closes them she
has little lightening flashes on her lids

CONOR
“Well she tells me she’s a model
Of international reputation She’s
lightening in a bottle But there’s
a stipulation”

She sets off and Conor follows her Darren walks backwards in
front of them

Conor yells “Cut” and makes some adjustments Ngig has moved
his synthesiser and stand about three feet to try get in the
back of Conor’s shot

CONOR
Cool How does it look Darren

DARREN
Pretty epic It’s hard keeping
focus on that zoom And Ngig stop
moving into the back of his shot

( )

NGIG
I haven’t moved an inch

DARREN
You started about three foot that
way

NGIG

It was windy

CONOR
And it’s not too shaky when you’re
following us

DARREN
No it’s grand

CONOR
Okay take 2

FIRST VIDEO SHOT ON ACTUAL EARLY VHS
Here we see their actual results edited crudely together

INTRO Some zooms into hands playing instruments Keyboard
Bass Guitar Ngig is wearing leather gloves

FIRST VERSE Conor breaks away from the band singing into
camera in front of Raphina Ngig edges into his shot

Four quick shots of each band member turning their heads and
looking into camera

Raphina signing autographs for the band members over the
line “She has an international reputation”

CHORUS

Raphina breaks away walking down the laneway Conor walks
around her singing to her ala Michael in Thriller But
Darren’s camera work is RIDICULOUSLY shaky Like sea sick
inducing

SECOND VERSE

The band are using the abandoned car as their set Some
sitting on the roof Some on the boot (or hood for our

American colleagues) and others in the body of the car

Raphina is standing on the sidewalk Conor gets out of the
car offering her a lift She sits in

Up front Conor is “driving” Raphina She looks into camera
for the last line and mouths “The riddle of the model”

End

( )

The group laugh as they prepare to watch playback through the
viewfinder

But this moment is interrupted when Barry Bray appears up the
laneway He is walking with an unshaven man in his mid-
thirties who is drinking a can of beer A friend or brother
maybe They are carrying a few plastic bags of shopping

CONOR
(under his breath)
Oh shit

Barry and THE MAN pass them THE MAN slowing down to check
out what’s going on He looks like he’s had a few cans
already

MAN
It’s just kids filming something
What are you filming lads

CONOR
A video for a band Hi Barry

Barry shrugs

MAN
Are these in your school Barry

Whatever has come over Barry he is less confident in the
presence of THE MAN Less of a bully

MAN
They’re wearing bleedin make up
Jaysus lads are yous making a
movie is it

His laugh turns into a coughing fit His tattooed hands over
his mouth as he coughs

DARREN
A video for a band

MAN
Why don’t you get in the band
Barry Hah Dress up and all You’d
be bleedin’ great
He starts laughing at the idea of Barry in costume

BARRY
Ah piss off

But he doesn’t like this

He hits him a slap on the side of his head It’s a sucker
punch and totally out of proportion

( )
MAN

What did you say

The mood has suddenly changed Barry hardly flinches but you
can see his eyes are watering up The MAN calms down Lights

a cigarette

Barry catches eyes with Conor who looks away

MAN

See yous boys Good luck See yous

at the Oscars Come on Barry

Barry follows behind They turn the corner up ahead The
others don’t know what that was

DARREN

Knackers Come on

Never mind them

Darren presses play on the machine as the others watch But
Conor’s attention is momentarily taken by Barry who makes a
throat-slitting gesture back to Conor All the colour drains

from Conor’s face

ttention back to the viewfinder On

screen Conor begins singing Raphina smiles at him She
grabs his hand in excitement as she appears on screen And
doesn’t let go Conor looks down at his hand in hers

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Conor is cycling his rusty racer through the city Raphina is
sitting on the cross bar holding on to the handlebars
enjoying the wind in her hair

RAPHINA

So where do you live

CONOR

Not far from the school Harcourt

Terrace

RAPHINA

Oh by the canal

there

You grew up

( )
CONOR
Yeah Though we might be moving My
parents are broke That’s why they
sent me to that school

RAPHINA
Yeah I wondered about that You’re
a bit posh for around here

She laughs
CONOR
Speak for yourself Your house is
massive
She is silent
CONOR

And my parents are probably
splitting up

RAPHINA
That’s sad You doing okay with it

CONOR
Oh yeah It’s sort of intense being
around them They’1l probably get
separate flats We’ll live between
two places Me and my brother
Which will be cool I’m like “Guys
split up you’re killing each
other”

He is experimenting with this It is not how he feels about

it at all

RAPHINA
A bit like an American movie
You’1l be all complicated and
divorced and sophisticated

CONOR
(bluffing)
A bit yeah

He doesn’t quite know what she means as they pull up outside
her house across from the school She jumps off the bike

RAPHINA
Jesus all that drama I’m glad I
don’t have parents

CONOR
Right

He has no idea what she means Though intrigued he is polite

enough not to ask

( )

A Ford Granada screams into the street and skids up beside
them The window winds down and a smiling man is at the
wheel Music blaring smoking a cigarette

MAN
Hey baby

RAPHINA
Hi This is Evan Adams

MAN
Word

CONOR
How do you do

RAPHINA
This is Conor the singer in the
band I mentioned

EVAN
Ah Cool She played me your song
Good vibes Bitta Duran Duran in
there little bitta New Romance
What style would you say you are

CONOR
I’m a futurist

EVAN
Epic See you in the future then
You ready baby

RAPHINA
Yeah See you soon

She gives Conor a very European kiss on either cheek He is
blushing awkwardly Evan looks very dangerous and cool
wearing a dirty leather jacket and sunglasses He is
listening to GENESIS

Raphina gets into the passenger seat and the car revs up

EVAN
Nice blouse

He shouts as he spins off She rolls down her window and
gives him a big white smile

RAPHINA
Let’s make another video soon
yeah

Evan U-turns But but has over estimated the width of the
street and the coolness of the U-turn is undermined by the
fact that he has to do a five point turn

Finally the car drives off

( )

Conor stands around Suddenly he feels very young and self
conscious And he’s wearing his mother’s blouse

He looks over towards the gate on her house As he passes it
he sees a detail he missed before It’s a small sign on the
gate It reads

KIRWIN HOUSE ESTABLISHED 1940

He continues past

INT BRENDAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Conor is playing Brendan the dailies of his first video They
are watching it on a small TV at the end of Brendan’s bed On
screen a wobbly camera follows Raphina down the laneway

CONOR
You have to imagine it’s not as

BRENDAN
Shit

The take ends Conor nervously awaits his brother’s reaction
Below the table we see that Conor’s fingers are crossed

BRENDAN
(finally)
This will be good

CONOR
(delighted)
Really

BRENDAN
Yeah If you had proper cameras and
a good director As long as it’s in
your head that’s the important
thing This is an exercise in

imagination
CONOR
Really
BRENDAN

Yeah Think big Conor This is all
just a means to an end
SHE looks amazing

They both watch Raphina on screen Frankly she is the only
good thing about this whole affair She has a confidence and
sultry beauty that totally belongs on screen

BRENDAN
The “Riddle of The Model” isn’t a
great title

(MORE)

( )
But your chorus is promising You
gotta get her in all the videos

CONOR
Yeah

BRENDAN
Oh yeah She should connect them
all She’s world class Looks a
little like Dee C Lee from the
Style Council Without her you’re
just a bunch of gay looking
children down an alleyway She
elevates it
So did you kiss her yet

Surprised by his forthrightness

We hold on Brendan

CONOR
What No way

BRENDAN
Why not

CONOR
She’s a year older than me And
anyway she’s got a boyfriend

BRENDAN
Oh yeah Who

CONOR
Evan Adams He’s like a grown man
He has a car and all and stubble

BRENDAN
What’s he doing hanging out with a
kid

CONOR
She’s not really like a kid

He doesn’t like the sound of this He has

pulled three albums out of his collection He hands them to

Conor

Conor studies the sleeve

The Jam

CONOR
What’s this

BRENDAN
Homework You’re good Get better

BRENDAN
How do you know he’s her boyfriend
anyway

A Joe Jackson record The Police

( )

CONOR
Well it seemed like he was They
pulled off in his car music
blaring He’s pretty cool

BRENDAN
What was he listening to

CONOR
Genesis

BRENDAN
He won’t be a problem

CONOR
Really

BRENDAN
Trust me no woman can truly love a
man who listens to Phil Collins

off we hear a row breaking out downstairs between the
parents Brendan lowers the volume

BRENDAN
Shh Listen

They listen Raised but muffled voices Slammed doors The
smash of a plate

BRENDAN
I think she’s having an affair

CONOR
What Why

BRENDAN
I see her getting a lift home from
her boss a couple of times a week

CONOR
She doesn’t drive What’s wrong
with that

BRENDAN

She always gets out of the car
about a hundred yards up from the
house It’s a nervous thing She’s
overcompensating
We hold on Conor considering this It clearly makes him very
sad

EXT STREET - NIGHT

On bike

( )

Conor free wheels He is preoccupied In his satchel over his
shoulder the three albums

EXT SYNGE STREET - RAPHINA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Conor cruises by Raphina’s house He leans against a tree
still sitting on his bike He’s not sure what he’s doing
here

He is about to cycle off when the Ford Granada pulls up and
Raphina gets out crossing over to the driver’s door Evan
Adams holds onto her hand pulling her back She laughs and
pulls away making her way up her steps He accelerates off
wheel spinning burning rubber She rings the doorbell In a
moment a WOMAN (60s) opens the door and lets her in

Across the street Conor checks his watch Just coming up to
9 pm

He cycles off

EXT EAMON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Conor knocks on the front door of Eamon’s house Checks his
watch hoping it’s not too late

In a moment Eamon answers carrying a rabbit

EAMON
Howareyou Conor What’s going on

CONOR
I don’t know What are you doing

EAMON
Just rabbit stuff

CONOR
Do you want to write a song

Eamon opens the door wider meaning YES

INT EAMON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eamon sleeps in the attic room The room is covered in
posters of bands and football teams And some rabbits

Conor and Eamon are studying the records playing and
replaying parts

Now they are working on a song They are laughing and having
a good time Conor writes words down Eamon tries different
chords They record parts on a tape machine

EXT SYNGE STREET - RAPHINA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Conor returns down Raphina’s street He pulls up outside her
house across the school and walks through her gate climbing
the steps

He takes a brown envelope covered in sellotape from inside
his jacket and looks at it

RAPHINA

He stuffs it through the letter box and heads off cycling
away looking up at one of the lights in the window

INT RAPHINA’S ROOM - NIGHT

This is a tiny monastic little room There are some posters
on the wall and a small single bed under an alcove A small
dresser with mirror A chair

Raphina enters carrying a bowl of cereal She sits down on
her bed She is still wearing her clothes In a moment a
knock on the door and a head pops in

This is MRS KIRWIN a matronly looking woman in an
apron She is carrying Conor’s envelope She passes it to
Raphina
MRS KIRWIN
This came through the letter box
for you

RAPHINA
Oh Thanks

MRS KIRWIN
Is it from that older lad

RAPHINA

MRS KIRWIN
You know how I feel about that
Raphina don’t you

RAPHINA
Yes Thank you Night

Mrs Kirwin nods exiting

MRS KIRWIN
Lights out in ten

She pulls the door closed and Raphina opens the envelope
There’s a cassette in side With NEW SONG written on it

( )

She locates a little tape player from under her bed and puts
it in pressing play
SECOND SONG
The song begins on acoustic guitar with Conor singing
Raphina smiles as she recognizes his voice She sits down at
her dresser and begins combing her long hair starting to

take off her makeup and kicking off her shoes

The song is instantly catchy and clearly a love letter from
Conor to her

As the song hits the chorus we PAN off her face and start a
360 slowly around her room as the song plays over

There’s a family photograph on her locker A 10 year-old
Raphina in the company of her parents They all look very
stiff and awkward

A school profile of Raphina in her uniform a couple of years
ago Very troubled

Off this to various pictures she ripped out of glamour
magazines Models Big hair Lots of make up

A poster of Tom Waits
Of The Cure
Of Siouxsie and the Banshees

There’s a teddy bear on her bed with a pair of sunglasses on
his nose and an unlit cigarette stuffed into his mouth

An ash tray with a few sticks of incense
A collection of cassette tapes
Cartons of cigarettes

Two books on her locker- Catcher in the Rye and To Kill A
Mocking Bird Numerous magazines Vogue You Cosmopolitan

As the song comes towards its end we have arrived back
around on Raphina She has transformed She’s changed into
her pyjamas and dressing gown And she’s taken off her makeup
to reveal a bruise under her eye and a cut lip underneath
She has paused what she’s doing and her eyes have filled
with tears as she listens to the song

EXT A STREET - NIGHT
The song cross cuts with Conor cycling at night through town

FADE TO BLACK

EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL GATES - A NEW DAY

Music plays over as Conor turns the corner into the school
gates There is a little confidence in his step this time

He has bleached his hair blonde and styled it so this falls
over his eyes a little in a NEW ROMANTIC way

He is wearing a little mascara and a little shadow People
stare at him As he passes us we PULL onto BROTHER Baxter
who watches from above

INT ART CLASSROOM - DAY

Conor sits in art class He is painting a picture of his
band Miss Dunne leans over his shoulder

MISS DUNNE

I like it What is that
CONOR

My band
MISS DUNNE

You’re in a band Cool What are
they called

CONOR
I don’t know yet What about “La
Vie” It’s French for “The life”

MISS DUNNE
I know I like that

In a moment there is a knock at the door and a FIFTH FORM
KID enters

FIFTH FORMER
Headmaster wants to see Conor
Lawlor

Miss Dunne nods Conor gets up heading out with the fifth
former worried

EXT SYNGE STREET YARD - DAY

Conor follows the fifth former as he marches across the empty
yard He looks over his shoulder at Conor

FIFTH FORMER
What are you wearing on your face

CONOR

Bit of make up I’m in a band What
do you think Brother Baxter wants

( )

The fifth former shrugs

FIFTH FORMER
Hurry up

INT BROTHER BAXTER’S OFFICE - DAY

Brother Baxter is filling out files He doesn’t look up
Conor is led into the room

FIFTH FORMER
Conor Lawlor Brother

He closes the door leaving Conor standing there Finally
Brother Baxter looks up

BROTHER BAXTER
What’s going on

CONOR
With what

BROTHER BAXTER
Withthis

He gestures the face

CONOR
Oh Well I checked the rule book
The one you mentioned about the
brown shoes I couldn’t find
anything about makeup Or altering
hair colour

He shrugs He lifts his foot up revealing the newly painted
black shoes

CONOR
I painted them With paint from the
art room

Brother Baxter doesn’t even look at them He is seething
underneath

BROTHER BAXTER
Head down to the toilets and remove
the make up right now

CONOR
Why

BROTHER BAXTER
Because I told you to

( )

CONOR
I’m in a band now A school band
And I think it’s important for us
to have a “look”

BROTHER BAXTER
Youre a man Men don’t wear
makeup

CONOR
Yeah but why not Like people in
the 18th century would have worn
make up So that means that people
like Mozart would have And he was
a man

BROTHER BAXTER
So you’re Mozart are you

Conor shrugs a little embarrassed Shakes his head

BROTHER BAXTER
That makes me Salieri is it

CONOR
Who’s Salieri

BROTHER BAXTER
Take the make up off and stop
acting like you deserve special
treatment

CONOR
I don’t want special treatment At
all

BROTHER BAXTER

You’ve a fine face I wouldn’t

worry about covering it up with

make up

He smiles Conor stands there trying to work this one out

BROTHER BAXTER

You can use me own bathroom there

If you like

He gestures a door off his office

CONOR
I’m going to go back to class now

Conor exits We hold on Brother Baxter

INT THE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Conor exits the office but Brother Baxter is hot on his
tail He grabs Conor by the hair and drags him down the
corridor Conor shouts and wriggles but BB means business
It’s like a red mist has descended over him He slaps hima
couple of times across the side of the head Other kids look
on clearing the way

BB kicks in the door to the students’ bathroom pushing Conor
through in front of him

INT THE TOLIETS - CONTINUOUS

Conor falls into the toliets BB follows picking him up and
forcing him over to one of the sinks

CONOR
You can’t do this

BROTHER BAXTER
You wanna bet

BB turns on the taps and as the sink fills up plunges
Conor’s head into the water

Conor bucks like a drowning animal Brother Baxter pulls his
head back out Conor gasps for air spluttering water
Brother Baxter slaps a bar of soap into Conor’s face mushing
it into his face

BROTHER BAXTER
(shouting)
We’ll get you clean Don’t worry
Well clean you up And get that
shite off ye

Then down into the water again Conor splutters Again he is
pulled back out now crying and coughing his make up mixing
with soap and dripping down his face

Brother Baxter wipes his hand with a towel and turns to go
leaving Conor leaning over the sink shivering

He exits We hold on Conor

INT ART CLASSROOM - LATER

Conor is back in regular class He has makeup stains under
his eyes and his hair is wet He looks like a drowned rat
He is shivering but holding back tears All eyes are on him
Some giggling others shocked He looks very alone

EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - DAY

Students exit the main gate at the end of the day Conor
pushes his bike out

To his surprise Raphina is leaning against the school gates
up ahead

She is listening to music on massive 1970s-style headphones
with a curly lead They are plugged into her battery operated
tape player from home She’s smoking a cigarette

She gives him a wave and one of her killer smiles Just
seeing her lifts him

RAPHINA
Hey Cosmo

CONOR

RAPHINA

That’s what I’m calling you now
Cosmo You need a catchy name if
youre going to be in a band

CONOR
Right What are you doing here

RAPHINA
Waiting for you What happened to
you

He looks pretty rough

CONOR
Oh Nothing
(off her tape machine)
Does that work

RAPHINA
(shouting)
For about half an hour Then the
batteries run out And I have to
rob more But it means I can take
my tapes anywhere

CONOR
Wow Portable music

She smiles Links his arm and walks off with him

EXT THE PARK - LATER — DAY

A small city centre park Some kids play on the swings
Others drink cider and smoke on a bench Conor and Raphina

me cry

CONOR

She pauses falling behind

RAPHINA
Are you jealous Cosmo

CONOR
Why would I be jealous

RAPHINA
Exactly Write me a happy song I

CONOR
What if I don’t feel happy

RAPHINA
Your problem is that you’re not

(beat)
HappySad

Cosmo searches her for the meaning of this She just smiles
back

She checks her watch

RAPHINA
Shit I gotta go We only have a

Cosmo is shocked by this But tries to lighten it

CONOR
So like “HappySad”

RAPHINA

She kisses him on either cheek again and turns to go but
then turns

RAPHINA
Let me know if you need me for
another video before I go

CONOR
Okay When are you going
RAPHINA
Soon
(beat)

You don’t have any problems Cosmo

She winks and sprints off leaving Cosmo to decode

INT BRENDAN’S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Conor is standing in the doorway of his brother’s room
Brendan sits on his usual chair

CONOR
-what did she mean by that

BRENDAN
She means that you’ve got to get to
a place in life where youre okay
with your sadness That you’re not
fighting it anymore but that
youre almost happy with it
It’s monastic She’s like a monk I
like this girl

CONOR

(Half-getting it)
Right Happysad

( )

BRENDAN
So her dad’s dead and her mum is
mental And you thought you had
problems
(beat)
So that’s what the older boyfriend
is about Daddy issues I used to
know chicks like her They can be
tricky And need a lot of
protecting Think you’re up for
that Conor

CONOR
I don’t know She’s not even my
girlfriend

BRENDAN
So what’s it all about then

CONOR
I think she’s just an amazing human
being I’ve never seen anything
like her The way she talks And
looks She wears these sunglasses
and when she takes them off her
eyes it’s like the clouds clearing
past the moon And sometimes I
just want to cry looking at her

Brendan pauses smiling

Brendan has taken a new album down from his shelf He slips
out the record and throws the sleeve to Conor An 80’s band
all dressed in black looking gloomy Conor is mesmerized by
their look

BRENDAN
Theyre happysad

A Gothic poplove song starts up on the turn table and
Brendan smiles

BRENDAN
Close the door

Conor pushes the door closed transfixed by the sound
Brendan takes his seat Conor his

It’s going to be a long night

DISSOLVE TO

EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL GATES - ANOTHER DAY

As the song continues Conor walks through the school gates
He is with Eamon and Darren Conor is now dressed in a long
black overcoat

( )

(Possibly his Mum’s) an endless scarf and has dyed his hair
black and back combed A junior Sherlock HolmesCure-head

EAMON
How do you mean you’re
“HappySad”

DARREN
Yeah How am I supposed to market
that

CONOR
It means that we’re not pop
anymore

EAMON

Were we pop I’m happy being any
type of band I just want to play

CONOR
That’s fine Be who you are Eamon

EAMON
I don’t know who I am Maybe I’m
HappySad too I don’t know

DARREN
(shouting)
What does HappySad mean How can
you be both bleedin things It
makes no sense

CONOR

(stopping)
It means that I’m stuck in this
shithole full of morons and
rapists and bullies and I’m going
to deal with it Okay It’s just
how life is now And I’m going to
try and accept that and get on with
it and make some art

DARREN
Right

EAMON
How does it affect our music

CONOR
Positively
INT THE DART TRAIN - DAY
Song continues over

The whole band with Darren and Raphina ride the dart train
out of the city

( )

They are carrying the camera and a few props- picture frames
and paint brushes The band are all Cure Heads now and look
quite good But it’s low-budget Cure Heads Conor and Raphina
sit across the aisle from them Music plays over as they
ride out towards the sea A welcome break from the city

Conor watches the sun burst behind Raphina’s profile He
smiles taking out the camera and filming her

Conor describes to the gang what this video will be about
reading from his journal

CONOR
So the idea of this video is about
a guy standing halfway down a pier
And a beautiful woman walks past
him Towards the lighthouse Half
an hour later she hasn’t come
back So he investigates But she’s
gone

DARREN
Wha

CONOR
There’s nowhere to go And yet
she’s not there

DARREN
She’s vanished

EAMON
She’s jumped in She’s killed
herself

CONOR
Correct She’s really sad

RAPHINA
No she’s not She’s a mermaid
She’s jumped back into the sea You
see she got washed up in a fishing
net And she’s been in the city
But she’s been dying to return to
the water To her friends Where
she belongs

Conor likes this He smiles He starts writing this into his
journal

CONOR
Yeah That’s better
EXT THE PIER - DAY

The band have set up their gear at the end of the pier
looking out to the Irish sea Conor is framing up the camera

( )

The wind threatens to blow it over on its tiny lightweight
tripod

CONOR
Okay so we’re playing here and
Raphina walks past Then I’1l1 show
you where you can jump off From
here it will look like you’ve gone
into the sea

He shows Raphina and the others a little ledge behind the
wall where it will appear as though she’s dropped into the
sea but is in fact just on the other side

RAPHINA
It’s not far enough down You’1l
see the top of my head

CONOR
Youll have to dip your head down
to make it look real

The others look doubtful including Raphina

CONOR
Trust me

EXT THE PIER - LATER

They are halfway through another song miming to playback
Darren is operating the camera They all look very gloomy and
introspective ala The Cure staring down at the ground and
barely playing their instruments

But the song is brilliant Darren holds up the picture frames
in front of the musicians in separate shots

Conor stands with his hands in his pockets Now Raphina
enters frame walking towards the end of the pier

She pauses for a moment and NGIG holds up a picture frame in
front of her as she walks She is mouthing the lyrics As she
gets to the end of the pier she stares out to sea
dramatically Conor is watching her in the background
singing

Then she jumps But NOT onto the ledge In fact she jumps
way past it and into the sea

For a moment Conor hasn’t seen what’s happened He goes on
singing But Darren looks up from the viewfinder

DARREN
(shouting over the music)
Em I think she went into the sea
Seriously

( )

Conor looks over towards the wall No sign of Raphina

CONOR
Shit

He breaks away from the group and runs over jumping up onto
the wall

Down below Raphina is struggling in the choppy water

CONOR
What the hell

RAPHINA
KEEP-BLOODY-FILMING

CONOR
What

Behind him Darren runs with the camera and tripod He has
heard her and is rolling Now the camera is on Conor

CONOR
What’1l1 I do
DARREN
Stop looking in the camera
RAPHINA
Save me
CONOR
What
RAPHINA
Jump in It’ll look great
CONOR
But my clothes
RAPHINA
I can’t swim
CONOR
You mean the character or actual
you
RAPHINA
ACTUAL ME

She is thrashing around in the water starting to get pulled
under Conor throws off his coat and looks towards Darren
Darren steadies the shot Gives the thumbs up Raphina is
shouting for help off

Conor dives into the sea Darren tilts down as he hits the
water A perfect shot

( )

DARREN
YES

Conor swims over to Raphina who is genuinely starting to
drown and pulls her towards the ledge The camera follows

The rest of the band have gathered on the edge of the pier
looking down and cheering

EXT ON THE WATER - CONTINUOUS

Down below Conor pulls her onto the safety of the ledge as
she spits mouth fulls of water

CONOR
Jesus Christ What were you
thinking

RAPHINA
(up to Darren)
Did you get it

Darren gives a thumbs up as he scans back over the shot

RAPHINA
Fantastic

The band laughs

CONOR
Can you really not swim

RAPHINA
Nope

CONOR
Then why did you do that

RAPHINA
For our art You can’t do things by
half Cosmo

He shakes his head searching her They are both shivering
and wet Suddenly he reaches in and steals a kiss She is
silenced by it Amazed

CONOR

Sorry I I’m sorry That

was
RAPHINA

Great Is what it was Fair play
CONOR

(happy )
Was it

EXT THE PIER - LATER

The gang haul their gear back up the pier Conor and Raphina
fall back Raphina is looking out to sea

CONOR
You know on a clear day you can
actually see the mainland of
England Ireland is actually only
30 Miles from the coast of Wales
It has to have just rained No dust
in the air Then you can just about

see it

RAPHINA
No way How do you know stuff like
that

CONOR

My grandad worked on the ships to
Holyhead He used to bring me out
here We used to go out on his
little boat Fishing

RAPHINA
Wow So I can wave back to you when
I’m in London

Conor’s heart sinks They both stop and look out to sea The
others carry on
INT THE TRAIN - RETURNING - DAY

The gang returns to the city at dusk tired and worn out from
all the sea air The rooftops of Dublin spreading out through
the window Raphina leans her head against the glass looking

out Conor sits next to her

CONOR
My brother says all the great
artists had to get off this island
The ones who stayed just got
depressed Or turned into
alcoholics

RAPHINA
That makes sense You mention your
brother a lot don’t you Do you
really love him

Conor shrugs He’s never been asked a question like this

CONOR
Well he’s kind of like my dad ina
way He seems to be the only one
who cares how I turn out Like take
music— when we were kids we shared
a room- and he’d play me records
every night Falling asleep He
said that way the music entered
into your subconscious He’s a bit
mad like that

RAPHINA

He sounds cool My dad used to sing
songs to me falling asleep And it
got so I couldn’t fall asleep until
he was back from the pub Which was
usually after 11 Then he’d sit
there on the side of the bed
singing The Auld Triangle or
whatever old mad rebel songs The
smell of drink and I’d fall asleep
with the music

(beat)
Always had trouble sleeping since
he died

She smiles

INT CONOR’S HOUSE - DAY

Conor and Brendan sit at the top of their stairs Down below
Penny is sitting in the porch catching the last few minutes
of evening sun They watch her her shoulder straps pulled

down a little a glass of wine poured and a cigarette in the

ashtray

It is a beautiful sad image

( )

BRENDAN

(watching her)
Look at her She races home in the
evening to get that last little bit
of sun She sits there and reads
the evening paper She’s always
talking about a holiday to Spain
But he never takes her This is all
she gets Then that tall tree
blocks it and she comes in I
often wonder what she’s thinking
about

We hold on Conor watching his mother

EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL YARD - ANOTHER DAY -

Conor walks with the band through school He is wearing
massive sunglasses and a porkpie hat The rest of the band
are a little ABC Outside his class they disperse back to
their individual classes Conor joins his queue Barry is
waiting with the rest of the class to get in He laughs at
Conor

BARRY
I hear you’re in a band now What
are they called The queers

A few lame laughs from the group

CONOR
Good one Barry Is someone getting
these down You know who you’re
like Barry Oscar Wilde

BARRY
What class is he in

Conor shakes his head Some people laugh at Barry Another
bigger kid standing with some fifth formers overhears this

BIGGER KID
He’s not in school Barry you
spanner
BARRY
Wha
BIGGER KID
You spa

The crowd laughs Barry is not used to this
BARRY

I’m going to kill you some day do
you know that

( )
CONOR
No you’re not Because you don’t
even exist

BARRY
What

Barry comes up close to him This time Conor stands his
ground A small group is gathering

CONOR
Youre living in my world I’m not
living in yours You’re just
material for my songs

BARRY
Be careful what you say now you’ll
get a battering

CONOR
Go ahead Barry Beat me up while
you still have the power This is
the best year of your life But
it’1l all come crashing down when
you leave school You only have the
power to stop things But not to
create

He turns Barry doesn’t stop him It’s a minor triumph for
the little man Conor joins the back of the group on his
own Barry makes a wanker gesture with his fist

This bomb is diffused but the battle is far from over

call their mother MUM

CONOR

journal instead

INT SYNGE STREET ART CLASSROOM - DAY

They walk out In the background Barry tears his report card
in half and throws it away without even reading it He then
boxes another kid in the face and approaches Conor Eamon and
Darren

He reaches in his school bag and takes out a homemade knife
A metal bar with a plastic scalpel welded it to it

BARRY
I made this in metal work class
What do you think And you said I
couldn’t create anything

Conor is silent It looks gnarly and lethal Barry smiles

BARRY
And I’m going to mark you with it
One of these days And you won’t be
so handsome then In your little
band

Conor looks at it then at Barry

CONOR
Why are you targeting me Barry
What did I do to you

BARRY
I don’t like you

( )

CONOR
Is it because your brother beats
you up And you’re taking it out on
someone else Like that day down
the laneway

BARRY
(laughs)
That’s not me brother That’s me
da What are you saying about me
da

He leans in laughing menacingly raising the knife to
Conors face A millimeter from his mouth

Just then Brother Baxter appears out of a doorway behind
them

Barry quickly pockets the knife before Brother Baxter sees
it

BROTHER BAXTER
What’s going on here Is there a
problem Lawlor

CONOR
No Brother

Brother Baxter just turns and re-enters his office closing
the door Barry is as surprised as the rest of them He looks
around then skulks off

BARRY
See you around

We hold on Conor

INT SYNGE STREET ART CLASSROOM - DAY

About ten local teenage girls sit on desks Ten boys stand
around the classroom They’ve turned up to be extras

A number of tables have been turned upsidedown to make a
small stage On this the band’s gear has been set up Garry
checks his drum kit on stage Miss Dunne is hanging
decorations up including a disco ball Darren is moving
about with the camera looking for shots

Across the room Miss Dunne checks her watch

MISS DUNNE
So you’d better film something I
have to lock up in an hour

DARREN
Yeah She’s not coming Let’s do it
without her

( )

Conor reluctantly agrees He gets up on stage

DARREN
So all of you come and stand here
You have to pretend it’s a live
gig And you’re the audience

CONOR
Okay so everyone This is like a
school video But not like an Irish
school More like an American
school And it’s the prom night
We’ll rehearse it

He presses playback and the band mime Conor sings into a
microphone But his eyes are on the door We hear the first
verse The band are really coming along Conor is really
developing some stage presence

Again he looks towards the door But this time it opens
Raphina is coming through But she’s dressed up in an

amazing 1950s style prom dress As she enters we start to
notice that we are not in the classroom anymore We are in a
huge school hall It’s prom night in a big American school

Conor’s band are transformed on stage All wearing cool 50’s
clothes

In this video Conor’s parents will arrive all dressed up
and happy together to see their son on stage Brendan shows
up like Jimmy Dean in Rebel Without A Cause and makes a
fool of the bungling Brother Baxter And Conor will defeat
the evil Barry who is dressed like the lead Scorpion in
Grease

Then the ENTIRE audience start a choreographed DANCE
sequence which brings us out

We pull out from the view finder and find ourselves back in
the mean little classroom in Dublin The group is huddled
around the view finder There’s no sign of Raphina It’s all
been in Conors head

smoking and drinking shit

He sits down

ROBERT
Well So firstly we don’t want to
make a big deal about this Lot’s
of married couples-

PENNY
Your father and I are splitting up

BRENDAN
(getting up)
Thank you Knew it was just a
question of time Let me know when

Why don’t you sit down Brendan for
a second and we’ll tell you what
were thinking See if you agree

BRENDAN
Oh A consensus Well that’s novel
Go ahead

He sits down We push in on Conor for the following

ROBERT
So your mother’s fallen in love
with Tony And they’re going to
move into his apartment for a
while We got an offer on this
house- it’s half what it’s worth
but we’re going to take it I can’t
afford to stay here on my own

CONOR
So are you like getting a
divorce

PENNY

No you can’t get divorced in
Ireland Well be legally

everyone

ROBERT

will live between there and

BRENDAN
I won’t be staying in Tony’s Let’s
get that very straight I’d rather
sleep on the street

Brendan seems unusually angry Even twitchy

ROBERT
Well talk about all the details
Tony’s a very nice man I can vouch
for that

This is very hard for him to say Penny is surprised

PENNY
(almost silently)
Thank you

BRENDAN
Wow Look at you two This is the
first time I’ve seen you being nice
to each other in ten years

( )

He lights up a cigarette raising his eyes to heaven

CONOR
Maybe he’s right Maybe this is
what you needed to do you know to
get back Closer than before

Everyone looks at Conor Suddenly seeing how young he is And
how vulnerable

CONOR
You don’t love Tony You hardly
know him You got that job a few
months ago It’s just an excuse A
way of ending this relationship
because you don’t know how to keep
it together

ROBERT
Now Conor You don’t know what
youre talking about

He gets up and exits slamming the door After a moment
Brendan gathers his stuff and exits shaking his head
leaving the parents sitting there on their own

INT BRENDAN’S ROOM —- MOMENTS LATER

Brendan enters his room to find Conor sitting on the hammock
Brendan sets his stuff down

CONOR
So you were right

BRENDAN
It was obvious

CONOR
They’re our parents They’re
supposed to look after us So we
can do stuff

BRENDAN
That’s bullshit They’re just human
beings I told you that

CONOR
I was sort of hoping they’d come to
my gig on Friday

BRENDAN
What You thought they’d suddenly
become different people And start
noticing what you were doing Or
wanted They have their own shit
going on They’re not going to come
to your stupid gig

( )
This is not the usual Brendan

CONOR

BRENDAN

Look at you You little punk You

know nothing do you You’re the
youngest You get to follow the
path that I macheted through the
jungle that is our mad family They
took all their shit out on me I
got bitten by every insect and
snake And fell into every river
For six years I was alone with
those two You think they’re mad
now think what they were like when
they were in their late twenties
with a screaming baby in a rented
flat who got married because they
were two Catholics who wanted to
sleep with each other They didn’t
even love each other And I was in
the middle of that On my own And
then you came along thank God and
followed the trail I cut for us
You just moved in my jet stream
Untouched And people laugh at me
now At the stoner The college

dropout And praise you

a bottle of milk She’s been looking at them But she quickly
looks away We think we recognize her But we’re not sure
Conor double takes then breaks away from the lads and runs
towards her as she runs up the steps

something wrong with me

She hits her head her eyes filling with tears

time I was actually happy I

you

stomper

Cosmo is transformed on stage He’s stepped outside himself
He’s carefree and confident with the microphone and his
weeks of rehersal have paid off The band is tight

Miss Dunne is delighted The other teachers aren’t so sure of
the angry passionate performance and risqué lyrics as the

forceful We hear the first verse

INT RAPHINA’S ROOM - EARLIER THAT DAY

Raphina is listening to the music It is the same song he is
playing live at the gig She is dressed as we saw her
earlier hair in a pony tail no make up sensible jeans and

being who you’re supposed to be That she must at least find
out if she could have made it as a model And made it to
London

off it Tunes a string Then gives up Crosses the room puts
the needle onto the vinal Picks up his hash paraphernalia
and begins rolling a joint on the back of the guitar tapping
his feet to the music Takes off his jacket He’s not going
anywhere

EXT THE PARK - NIGHT
Raphina sits on the bench listening to the same song Cosmo is
playing live She’s been listening over and over She’s

smiling and crying at the same time It is a call to her from
someone who really cares about her

( )

LYRICS
“I got to find out who I’m meant to
be I don’t believe in destiny But
with every word you say to me
something’s going to change

We hold on her eyes full of tears

INT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - GYM - NIGHT

Back on stage they have lost most of the crowd Many are
outside the windows smoking Others in groups chatting Only
a few GIRLS have stayed put looking up adoringly at the
young band

Now at the back of the hall the door opens and Raphina
steps in out of the cold

But she’s OLD RAPHINA again The hair is done the make up
And she’s dressed in a cool skirt doc boots and jacket She
can’t believe what she’s seeing Conor is singling with his
eyes closed She smiles walking through the hall towards the
stage Conor sees her and smiles singing the last verse to
her She stands at the front of stage looking up at him

LYRICS
“So bring the thunder bring the
lightening bring the fall I know
Ill get my heart through I’ve
miles to go but since the day I
started crawling I was on my way to
find you”

They finish to applause A SKINHEAD tries to get up on stage
but Barry who has been standing arms folded like a
bodyguard punches him off the stage

CONOR
Okay This is our last song It’s
about this school It’s for Brother
Baxter

People hoot and whistle Brother Baxter who stands at the
back of the hall is not impressed He signals to another
Brother to turn on the hall lights

Florescent lights blink on ruining the dark cavernous
atmosphere

The crowd collectively BOO One of the skinheads turns them
off again The crowd cheer

On and off again Things are getting chaotic The crowd is
getting pissed

( )

The Brother turns them on again Then the skin head turns
them off then takes a fire extinguisher and smashes it down
on the light switch ensuring they stay off

Brother Baxter is making his way towards stage He stands at
the side of the stage gesturing for Cosmo to come over

Conor heads over leaning down

BROTHER BAXTER

Lad don’t push it

CONOR

What It’s a tribute song

BROTHER BAXTER
If you want to keep this band going
next term you’d better be careful

CONOR
Oh Okay

He goes back onto stage

CONOR
(to Eamon)
You ready This may be all of ours
first and last gig man You ready
to do it

EAMON
Let’s go

CONOR
And you better come back to this
after school You’re a bloody
genius man

Eamon laughs

CONOR
(shouting into mic)
This is called “Brown Shoes” It’s
for every Christian Brother and
for every bully you ever knew

Larry starts with a thumping bass lick

Eamon and Garry join in Conor approaches the mic singing

angrily

CONOR
“Who the hell are you to tell me
what to do you wear a dress and
tell me not to wear Brown Shoes”

The crowd gets it They start moshing An angry guitar riff
soaring over the top line

( )

Conor sings a verse about being stabbed by a bully Then the
chorus

CONOR
(singing)
“Well the boots on the other foot
now buckle up we’re taking you
down Your curtain’s falling so
take a bow”

He spots Raphina as he sings smiling

CONOR
“yeah you’ve had your time in
the sun so step aside it’s time
for some fun Yeah the boot’s on
the other foot take a bow”

Raphina joins in the dancing A few people stage dive The
Skinhead jumps around the room letting the fire extinguisher
off drenching everyone They love it The lights come on
again adding to the chaos Cosmo laughs as he screams a
mantra into the mic

CONOR
“Brown shoes Brown Shoes Brown
Shoes
Brother Baxter turns and exits unnoticed
CONOR
“Brown Shoes Brown Shoes BROWN
SHOES
And the song crescendos into a loud stab And ends

The crowd roars Conor and Raphina fix eyes laughing

CONOR
We are Sing Street

The DJ takes over as the crowd cheer

INT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL GYM - BACKSTAGE —- CONTINUOUS

Conor and the band get off stage hugging Raphina runs over
to meet him She kisses him They SHOUT above the music and
crowds

RAPHINA
You look great

CONOR
So do you

RAPHINA

You guys were brilliant

( )

CONOR
Really Shit Because I have to

RAPHINA

house So we’ll be moving So I

tapes for you and stalk you

She shrugs

CONOR
We should go

She nods her head without needing to think

RAPHINA
How

CONOR
On a boat

RAPHINA
On the ferry like They won’t let
us travel You’re too young I
mean I’d get away with it But
youre just a baby

He’s shaking his head all this coming to him like a bolt
from the blue

CONOR
No We borrow a boat From Dalkey
It’s 35 Miles How far can that be
It’s like 45 minutes in good
weather

RAPHINA
You mean steal a boat

CONOR
Are you ready There’s nothing
going on here right now

She thinks about it They look at each other wide-eyed

EXT SYNGE STREET SCHOOL RAPHINA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

She runs towards the steps of her house

RAPHINA
Two minutes I need to pack a few
things

CONOR

She laughs

EXT CONOR’S HOUSE - NIGHT

They run around the corner and up to Conor’s house hand in
hand Raphina is carrying a bag

INT BRENDAN’S ROOM —- MOMENTS LATER

Brendan is writing something in his writing pad and smoking
one Conor knocks and enters followed by Raphina

BRENDAN
Hey What’s going on

CONOR

BRENDAN
In bed Why

RAPHINA
Hi

( )

She bows

CONOR

CONOR

Grandad’s little pleasure boat is
still moored there We’re going to
sail to England The two of us
We’re all set But we need a lift
to the harbour

Brendan looks at them They are totally serious He thinks
about it

BRENDAN

BRENDAN
What Do you have any friends
there
CONOR
No
BRENDAN

Raphina and Conor smile

INT CONOR’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
In a frenzy Conor throws things in a shoulder bag
INT ROBERT AND PENNY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Conor sneaks in to his parents’ room He tip toes over to the
bedside locker The car keys are under the lamp

( )

He fishes them up silently and as he does so looks at his
parents asleep Robert is sleeping on the floor beside the
bed Penny is on the bed in a shaft of moonlight

Conor pauses looking at them almost smiling Then his eyes
fill up with tears They look very vulnerable He leans in to
his Mum

CONOR
I love you Mum

She repositions herself in the bed But she doesn’t hear him
We hold on him smiling

EXT CONOR’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Conor and Brendan pull the tarpaulin off the old car in the
driveway

The old car reverses out of the driveway Conor and Raphina
jump in
INT THE CAR - NIGHT

Palpable excitement in the car as Brendan drives it south
out to the sea

EXT COLIEMORE HARBOUR - DAWN

The car pulls up to a small jetty A few old boats bob up and
down in the moonlight They all get out carrying their bags
down towards one small pleasure cruiser Dalkey Island just
across the water

RAPHINA
Jesus you were right it’s really
close
She smiles
CONOR
It’s a little bit further than
that
They approach the hero boat It’s an open boat with a
steering wheel and a little tarpaulin shelter area at the
back It’s pretty basic

RAPHINA
Is that it It’s tiny

They look out to sea

CONOR
Nice and calm

( )

BRENDAN
You DO know it can get pretty
choppy once you get out past the
island

CONOR
We’1l be grand

He heads They follow him to the edge of the jetty

He jumps on board the boat getting it ready Brendan and
Raphina stand watching him He appears to know what he’s
doing Kind of

He finds a can of petrol in the boat next to it and steals
it looking in his own engine

CONOR
I don’t believe it There’s still
petrol in it We’1ll take this one
as a spare Ready

He pulls the cord The engine coughs But doesn’t take
Raphina jumps in helping him as Brendan does lookout

Finally the engine comes to life spluttering and coughing
out smoke

Conor jumps back off handing Raphina her bag photographs
and his stuff She secures them under the little tarpaulin

Conor unties the boat from its mooring throwing the rope on
board

Then he turns to his brother

BRENDAN
Call home as SOON as you get there
okay No messing around

CONOR
I will We’ll get into the Welsh
coast Then hitch down to London
Be there this evening

BRENDAN
Okay

CONOR
You’1ll get some flak from the
parents for driving me out

BRENDAN
Ill be fine I’m bulletproof

He smiles He is far from bulletproof

( )
Brendan

BRENDAN
Oh here I wrote some words down
For a song

reaches in his pocket and produces a foolscap of

paper with loads of lyrics written on it

BRENDAN
They’re just a stream of
consciousness thing It’s about
this kid and a girl In the future
If you get there put some music to
them some day I’m serious Could
be a good song

CONOR
Okay I will

Conor takes it and folds it up carefully and puts it in his
inside coat pocket

Conor jumps back onto the boat

Raphina

Brendan
fade up
this is

RAPHINA
Come and visit us You seem like a
mad bastard

BRENDAN
Oh yeah You look after that
brother of mine He’s going to be
lost without me

RAPHINA
Hah I will

BRENDAN
And I hope you can swim

shakes Brendan’s hand and hugs him from the boat
is getting a little emotional as A SONG starts to

on the track He hugs his brother one more time But
no time for tears

Conor steers the little boat out of the harbour They wave

back to

Brendan who stands on the jetty waving

EXT THE BOAT - DAWN

The boat sets out onto the sea The shelter of the harbour is
immediately met by a strong wind The song swells

EXT THE BOAT - DAWN

The sun

is coming up but a heavy mist is refusing to lift

The waves are growing in force as the little boat sets off

( )

Raphina looks nervous It starts raining

INT THE CAR - DAWN

Brendan watches them from behind the wheel of his car They
look very vulnerable in the distance bobbing up and down He
starts screaming For no reason Shouting and screaming and
cheering looking at the little boat making its escape In a
way he’s on that boat The boat disappears around the side
of the island Brendan smiles shouting

EXT THE BOAT - MORNING
Now it’s raining hard The boat is buffeted by waves
CONOR
(shouting)
Youll want to sit down around now
RAPHINA
(shouting)
WHAT

In answer to her question the boat is hit by a good wave
knocking Raphina over

She huddles up under the tarpaulin soaked

Conor steers the boat with focus and determination She
watches him scared as the song soars

Ahead nothing but mist and rain No sign of a coastline
Then a bellowing HORN is heard off
Conor looks out Out of the mist a HUGE CAR FERRY is
appearing travelling in the same direction but cutting
across their boat’s course

RAPHINA
Conor slams the boat into reverse The engine grinds in
protest The FERRY passes them by Up on deck countless
Irish immigrants stand smoking drinking cans of Guinness
watching the sun come up etc Some of them see the little
boat below pointing and laughing
EXT THE CAR FERRY -— CONTINUOUS

POV Shot from deck of ferry

EXT THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS

Conor waves up at the people on deck Then speeds onwards
Raphina smiles looking at his back She tries to light up a
cigarette Then gives up She starts laughing

The SONG really takes off now It’s Conor’s voice singing

The lyrics are about him and Raphina About their future A
model and a singer About staying together Written from an
older brother’s perspective What we’re hearing is clearly a
marriage of Brendan’s lyrics and Conor’s music From the
future And it’s the only clue to whether Conor and Raphina
ever made it Because right now all we can see is mist
rain and grim determination on COSMO’S drenched face
