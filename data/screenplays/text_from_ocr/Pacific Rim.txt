BLACKNESS
A deep thunderous BOOM like a mountain hitting the ground
A garbled radio VOICE laughs triumphantly

VOICE (FILTERED)
Game on That sonuvabitch is down

INT CONN-POD ZUMA-1 -- DUSK

We’re tight on a young man’s face -- his square jaw tense
his short dirty blond hair damp with sweat his eyes focused
and urgent He’s RALEIGH ANTROBUS a rare sort of pilot

We dont see much It feels dark cramped and busy Perhaps
a cockpit Were dimly aware of Raleighs view reflected on
the glass visor of his helmet -- a flat blue horizon

RALEIGH
Stand by for confirmation

VOICE (FILTERED)
Rals We got him Nothing gets up
from a hit like that

Raleighs tension starts to ease but just as a smile of
relief begins to creep across his lips we see something move
in the reflection on his helmet --

A shape distorted out of focus monstrous vast Alive
Chilling in its size and obscurity as it rises to darken the
reflection We hear a bone-shuddering ROAR

Raleighs smile melts away His game-face quickly takes hold

RALEIGH
Look sharp Yance He’s getting up

INT COUNSELORS OFFICE -- DAY

Raleigh wakes on the couch (a year older) He unplugs a wire
from a port behind his ear and quickly sits up

His COUNSELOR a calm man in uniform unplugs his own wire
disconnecting from the Pons brain-to-brain server

Raleigh perches anxiously on the edge of the couch The
Counselor gives him a second Raleigh scratches the data port
discreetly embedded in the flesh behind his ear lobe

RALEIGH

I need to get this damn thing taken
out I’m not a driver any more

( )

COUNSELOR
I know you’ve had a rough go at it
so far but the port can actually
be useful in therapy --

RALEIGH
Sharing headspace with my own
brother was crowded enough I don’t
wanna make room for anyone else

COUNSELOR
Alright We can do it the old
fashioned way Talk it out

RALEIGH
No Listen I don’t want to relive
that day Okay I want to bury it

COUNSELOR
But you cant avoid the triggers
This is the world we live in now

Raleigh stands up to leave The Counselor catches him
putting a hand on his shoulder and confiding earnestly

COUNSELOR (CONTD)
This is a dagger in your heart
man The deeper you bury it the
harder it hurts You’1ll feel it
every time you hear about another
attack and you won’t know why

RALEIGH
I can tell you why -- because I’m
helpless And nothing you can say
will ever change that

INT LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

Raleigh passes the reception area on the way out A handful
of uniformed PERSONNEL are glued to the news on a wall-
mounted tv Raleigh stops He can’t help himself

On the news we see shots of toppled buildings upturned
cars and splintered Japanese billboards The label at the
bottom of the screen tells us it’s Tokyo

CNN ANCHOR (FILTERED)
-- the second attack in four
months up from last year --
(beat)
Just a moment

( )

In the chaotic rubble we pull back from a hill that turns
out to be the flank of some vast carcass entrails spilled
across the fractured streets like sagging hot air balloons

We see also the wreck of a heavily-armored human-shaped mech
-- a Jaeger MEN drag the distraught GUNNER from the wreck a
young Asian girl in a form-fitting drivesuit (more later)

CNN ANCHOR (FILTERED) (CONTD)
Were seeing the gunner now And
officials are confirming that
tragically her crewmate pilot Aki
Seto has died in the attack

Raleigh shakes himself from the grim news and promptly exits
EXT SHINAGAWA -- NIGHT

A cluster of tents amidst heaps of rubble The wrecked Jaeger
and kaiju carcass still looms in the background Helicopters

circle overhead throwing light down on the mess

SUPER Shinagawa Incident Zone -- Tokyo Japan

INT MEDICAL TENT -- CONTINUOUS

The improvised field hospital swarms with DOCTORS treating
the CASUALTIES of the attack

The gunner from the news footage MAKO MORI sits
catatonic her arm in a sling Her hair hugs her face ina
helmet-like Chinese bob She has firm and quiet bearing

A man in uniform spots her STACKER PENTECOST a black Briton
with a face that is at all times the very picture of
confident serenity He tries to get her attention

(NOTE Hereafter italicized dialogue indicates spoken
Japanese with English subtitles)

PENTECOST
Lieutenant Mori Lieutenant
Lieutenant Mako
Finally she looks up

PENTECOST (CONTD)
Theyve cleared you to go

MAKO
Hows the Jaeger

PENTECOST
The cores fried

He takes a seat beside her

( )

PENTECOST (CONTD)
Aki was a hero Mako He saved the
city He saved your life
She doesnt react
PENTECOST (CONTD)
You can go now You know that
right You dont have to stay
Slowly she turns to him

MAKO
Where can I go My Jaeger is
broken My winger is gone What am
I now Who am I

EXT JAEGER-MEISTER’S BAR and GRILL -- NIGHT

A dive bar fronting a small gravel parking lot off a dark

seaside highway -- an island of neon in the night
SUPER Jaeger-Meisters Bar and Grill -- Port Hueneme
California

FLICK (PRE-LAP)
So does our source have a name

INT COMPACT CAR -- CONTINUOUS
The dive’s neon sign casts a lurid glow on the windshield

In the driver’s seat FELICITY FLICK KINCAID A clever girl
in faded denim and paisley cotton a canyon bohemian flavor
She tucks her rambunctious blonde curls behind her ear

A series of brief cryptic emails fanned out in the
passenger seat She speaks to her IT guy (JIM) through a
bluetooth headset as she takes notes

JIM (FILTERED)
I couldn’t crack the remailer but
I pinged the dropbox and got a hit
It’s a cpoorg server

FLICK
CPO --

She scribbles notes glancing up at the PATRONS leaving the
bar most in standard-issue jumpsuits from the nearby Jaeger
base She’s expecting someone

JIM (FILTERED)

Calixto Particle Observatory Peru
Just outside of Lima

( )

FLICK
Yeah What do they observe

JIM (FILTERED)
Quarks bosons tachyons -- you
know stuff no one’s heard of

FLICK
So our guy’s a particle physicist

JIM (FILTERED)
You’re not going to Peru right

Already she’s surfing her smartphone for airplane tickets

FLICK
Not as far as you know

JIM (FILTERED)
I’m lying to your editor again

FLICK
He won’t understand

JIM (FILTERED)
That your leaving the country
instead of emailing the guy

FLICK
I send him questions His replies
are vague and infrequent If he’s
got the answers he claims to have
I need to meet him

JIM (FILTERED)
You don’t know how solid he is

FLICK
I will when I shake his hand

JIM (FILTERED)
Youll spook the hell out of him
He wants to be anonymous

FLICK
It’s not me he’s scared of If it
is he’s screwing with me

She spots Raleigh staggering out of the bar and quickly wraps
up her conversation

FLICK (CONTD)

I have to go Thanks Jim I owe
you one

( )

She grabs her stack of e-mails and gets out of the car

EXT JAEGER-MEISTER’S BAR and GRILL -- CONTINUOUS

Flick chases after Raleigh

FLICK
Raleigh

He spots her and keeps walking indifferent She follows

FLICK (CONTD)
I’ve been trying to get a hold of
you Ever check your messages

RALEIGH
I’m not going on the record Flick

FLICK
I’m not looking for an interview

RALEIGH
Oh You’re not You’ve finally
given up that tired dead end story

FLICK
(defensive)
There’s a region off Midway that’s
been spitting out giant monsters
for over a decade How can it still
be such a goddamned mystery --

RALEIGH
I dunno but the ocean floor is
like five miles deep out there
It’s not the easiest place to know

FLICK
So COSDEC’s just clueless

RALEIGH
Probably not but it’s all rumors
by the time it gets to us jocks

He gets to his car and unlocks the door Flick drops her ace

FLICK
Do they call it the Interstice

He stops -- they obviously do

FLICK (CONTD)
Yance let that word slip every once
in a while

(MORE )

( )

FLICK (CONTD)
I didn’t even remember until I got
this anonymous email
(reading)
“They know what the Interstice is”

RALEIGH
We shouldn’t be talking about this

FLICK
What is the Interstice

RALEIGH
I thought this wasn’t an interview

She relents she knows why she really hunted him down

FLICK
It’s not I’m just -- Jesus its
been like a year since weve talked
at all I was his fiancée Were

like family Friends at least

RALEIGH
Exes

FLICK
Ex-what I was never sure
(no answer)
You ever have a nightmare too awful
to talk about Rals

He ignores the question

FLICK (CONTD)
I saw how close you and your
brother were I did a piece about
it What you and me had it felt so
-- small I never thought you cared
enough to miss it Yance said you
were cool with me and him

RALEIGH
If Yance said it

FLICK
But you never did You never said
anything You just avoided us
And I wonder if hed be alive if
not for me I wonder if I screwed
up the bond that drove the machine

RALEIGH
Goddamn Flick Today of all days

( )

FLICK
Sorry but Ive been living with --

RALEIGH
He was my brother Flick

FLICK
Its my nightmare Okay And when I
wake up screaming
(trailing off)
You wont call me back Raleigh

She closes her eyes and pinches the bridge of her nose
embarrassed collecting herself She cant meet his eyes

RALEIGH
You know how the Pons works Two
Jaeger pilots driving the rig with
their brains all those thoughts
bleeding between them Every time
me and Yancy plugged in I had a
front row seat All those intimate
moments Ive walked in on you two
more times than you even know It
was torture driving that Jaeger
with him Just torture

Flick stares at him frozen tears welling up in her eyes

RALEIGH (CONTD)
So you want me to tell you none of
that colored my judgment that I
put it aside and did all I could
(pausing to reflect)
Well Im sorry Flick but I
dunno Probably not

Tears spill from her eyes She can find no words Finally
she SLAPS him as hard as she can

He watches her storm back to her car She throttles it out of
the gravelly lot ripping plumes of dust in her taillights

INT LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Raleigh staggers into his small mobile home

INT BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Raleigh splashes water on his face and meets his reflection
in the small mirror fractured as if by bare knuckles some

fitful night not so long ago

He steels his cold expression and nods slowly -- Yes this is
who you are Raleigh

( )

His brow cracks and he collapses over the toilet puking up
every shred of the stony facade hes been holding revealing
the raw anguish and self-doubt red-faced and heaving

Through his GASPING he almost doesnt hear the KNOCKING at
his front door

INT LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Raleigh takes a deep breath before he opens the door to find
a uniformed military officer on his doorstep LIEUTENANT—
COMMANDER ROSCOE CALHOUN He gives Raleigh a familiar grin

CALHOUN
Hey Raleigh Got a minute

EXT RALEIGHS HOUSE -- NIGHT

The mobile home overlooks the seaside strawberry fields off a
dark stretch of the PCH Raleigh sits on the tailgate of his
old pickup as Calhoun smokes his cigarette

In the distance the Point Mugu Air Station where the
silhouettes of the LA Strike Groups two Jaegers tower in the
ocean fog waiting red caution lights blinking placidly

CALHOUN
Tokyos down one Jaeger Its the
biggest city on the Rim Its
COSDEC headquarters The brass
wants redundancy They want a crew
covering that second Jaeger

RALEIGH
And you think I know somebody

Calhoun knows Raleigh sees it coming so he gets to it

CALHOUN

They just need some understudies
at least until the rooks graduate
this summer A few months tops
Youll go to Tokyo all expenses
paid youll eat some sushi and
youll be back in time for June
gloom Its a cushy gig

RALEIGH
The attacks are coming faster --

CALHOUN
Theres no evidence of long-term --

RALEIGH
You dont shoehorn two burnt-out
leftovers into a Pons and call ita
Jaeger crew if youre not expecting
some new kind of trouble

( )

CALHOUN

(leveling with Raleigh)
We dont know what to expect
Look you lost your winger and the
weight of the whole damn city fell
on your shoulders and for seventy-
seven seconds you carried it and
you finished the fight

A silence passes as Raleigh reflects on the proposition

RALEIGH
Whos your other sucker

CALHOUN
Another survivor

RALEIGH
Not the girl from the news

CALHOUN
Names Mako Mori Shes a little
thing but shes tough as nails

RALEIGH
Im amess and lost Yance over a
year ago She lost hers today

CALHOUN
(sighing a surrender)
Hell I dunno Ive never tried on
that skyscraper suit

They stare out towards the two distant Jaegers looming like
industrial colossuses in the silver murk of the marine layer

CALHOUN (CONTD)
You know I always wanted to ask --
Whats it feel like

Raleigh turns to him brow furrowed not sure if hes
serious He is Raleigh turns and stares at the Jaegers

silhouette for a while before answering

RALEIGH

There’s things you just can’t
fight Acts of God or whatever
Like you see a hurricane coming
you just have to get out of the
way you know But when you’re ina
Jaeger suddenly you can draw a
line in the sand You can fight the
hurricane -- and you can win

Calhoun nods quietly he gives Raleigh a moment

( )
ll

CALHOUN
Im sorry to bother you Raleigh
You take care of yourself okay

He starts away Raleigh watches him go dwelling on that
final thought He finally speaks up

RALEIGH
I never said I wouldnt do it

Calhoun turns and raises an eyebrow
INT FLICKS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Flick packs a suitcase her eyes still red her hands still
shaking slightly

She has to stop and take a seat at the edge of the bed Her
eyes meet a frame on the wall

A VANITY FAIR cover Raleigh and his brother in their pilot
gear standing arms crossed before the silhouette their
Jaeger HEART OF THE TANK The Antrobus Bros Reveal What
Drives the Men Who Drive the Jaeger -- by Felicity Kincaid

Flick folds herself up on the bed beside the half-packed
suitcase She rests her head on the pillow and locks her raw
eyes on the framed picture

DISSOLVE TO
EXT DESERT POND -- NIGHT (DREAM)
A pool hemmed by sandstone boulders bristling with sage A
man stands naked on the rocks covered in blood He falls

Flick runs But she doesnt catch him

She perches at the overhang looking down The man breaks the
surface and throws his head back suddenly okay

The man is Yancy Antrobus Raleighs brother We see the
resemblance but hes more carefree than his younger brother
an assured soul with the charm of a barefoot troubadour
Wisps of red spread from him turning the pool to blood

YANCY
Come on in Flick

FLICK
I cant Yance

YANCY
Well you cant stay out there

( )

Flick looks back to see a wildfire sweeping over the scrub
around her Something stirs beyond the flames something huge
and alive as if part of the horizon itself was waking up

Its shape rises high and obscure behind the swirling cinders
towering over the desert a vast behemoth shadowed in smoke
and night rearing up to blot out the stars

Yancy flashes Flick reassuring smile as he treads blood

YANCY (CONTD)
Jump in babe Come on Theres
nothing for you out there

Behind her the pitch-dark kaiju BELLOWS a dull bestial
grumble made loud and bone-shuddering by the sheer size of
the beast The THROBBING ground announces its every step

Hundreds of feet overhead its jagged jaws glow furnace-like
from within Ignescent saliva drips from its teeth like
molten napalm fueling the encroaching wildfire

An AIR RAID SIREN wails and Flick steps back unconsciously
inching away from the blazing heat -- until her last step
finds only air and she falls into the pool of blood

INT FLICKS BEDROOM -- MORNING

The AIR RAID SIREN becomes the nasal BLEATING of an alarm
clock Flick wakes with a start still in her clothes
exactly where we left her the previous night

She looks at the clock Its been going off for a while
Shes running late Without changing she puts on her shoes
zips up her suitcase and rushes out

EXT CENTRAL COMMAND COMPLEX -- DAY

A causeway extends to a man-made island in Tokyo Bay where
stands a small city of sleek robust buildings crew
dormitories administration and SuperCom

The largest structure a series of arching petals ringing the
launch area like the rim of an artfully broken dome a modern
flourish that lends the facility its nickname -- Shatterdome

SUPER Pacific Rim Combined Special Defense Corps Central
Command -- Tokyo Japan

EXT THE GREEN -- CONTINUOUS

An SUV emblazoned with the COSDEC shield pulls up and lets
Raleigh out on the rolling carefully-manicured lawn

Hes cleaned up groomed shaved and in uniform He hoists a

duffle bag over his shoulder and searches the UNIFORMS
milling on the grass A voice calls after him

( )

PENTECOST (0S)
Sub-Lieutenant Raleigh Antrobus

Commander Pentecost approaches with intimidating poise
PENTECOST (CONTD)
Lieutenant-Commander Stacker

Pentecost

RALEIGH
Good to meet you sir

He indicates for Raleigh to follow him

PENTECOST
Ill be conducting your training

RALEIGH
Due respect sir but Ive been
through training

PENTECOST
With whom

RALEIGH
Sir

PENTECOST

Who was your winger Was it your
best mate Your girlfriend

RALEIGH
It was my brother sir

PENTECOST
Well Im sure you know Sub-
Lieutenant Mori is not your
brother And that COSDECs
preference for crews who share a
history is not at all arbitrary

RALEIGH
Yes sir

PENTECOST
What you dont know is how hard it
will be to share headspace with a
stranger Itll be like youve
never driven a Jaeger in your life

INT LOCKER ROOM -- DAY
Mako towels off her sweat numb and weary Her slim frame

might seem girlish in street attire but her sports bra and
shorts utterly fail to hide her long taut ninjas physique

( )

Another Japanese girl enters surprised to find Mako KAORI
JESSOP a pilot for the second Jaeger -- taller than
Mako with longer curlier hair

KAORI
I hate that theyre making you do
this So soon after

MAKO
I volunteered Theres like three
other loners in the world and none
of them give a shit about Tokyo
Its my hometown I signed up as
soon as I heard they were looking

She changes into casual attire as Kaori gets into her gym
clothes eying her with friendly concern

KAORI
Are you sure youre okay

MAKO
Its been two weeks I passed the
psych evaluation

KAORI
Sure I just thought you might want
to talk about it

Mako says nothing Kaori surrenders the conversation About
to close her locker Mako spots a photo of her and Aki She
touches the corner as if about to peel it off but stops

MAKO
You know what the worst part is
The silence You dont even
remember what silence is until it
comes flooding back

A long moment Finally Mako looks up at Kaori She shuts the
locker and sits on the dressing bench A deep breath

MAKO (CONTD)
The Americans here

KAORI
I saw Pentecost showing him around

MAKO
Whats he like

KAORI
From a distance Maybe an eight

Mako shakes her head and half snickers Kaori grins warmly
and leaves her to finish dressing

INT LOCCENT GALLERY -- LATER

Pentecost leads Raleigh through an observation gallery
overlooking a mission control center buzzing with OFFICERS

PENTECOST
Heres our LOCCENT Much like your
own back at LASG no doubt

A plethora of consoles fan out from an incomprehensible
mosaic of holographic data filling the dome-shaped screen
that encompasses the command centers front wall

PENTECOST (CONTD)
Its a drill

Raleigh lingers squinting at the officer at the center of
the action a broad shouldered Japanese man in a crisp
uniform -- COMMANDER KAZ TAKADA PENTECOST (CONTD)
Commander Takada

RALEIGH
I thought that was him Whys he
running drills in LOCCENT

PENTECOST
The Supreme Commander doubles as CO
of the Tokyo Strike Group

INT SHATTERDOME -- DAY

Pentecost leads Raleigh onto the mezzanine overlooking the
main floor of the Jaeger launch bay

Below - the wide floor of the launch bay Sunlight spills
through the open top of the partial dome onto the mammoth
machines and giant equipment needed to service the Jaegers

The nearest Jaeger stands at its docking tower A Mark-2
dubbed TACIT RONIN Lean and nimble his streamlined armor
flecked with stark digital camo - steel blue on cool grey An
ultra-modern twenty-six story kickboxer

PENTECOST
Theres Tacit Ronin And -- ah
yes her crews actually over here

Two Jaeger jocks sit on the edge of mezzanine platform a
young couple in matching track suits

Weve already met Kaori Jessop The man is her husband - DUC
JESSOP Korean-Australian An Asian face but the
bleached hair and drawl of an Aussie surfer The flashy boots
he wears with his jumpsuit testify to his love of Westerns

( )

PENTECOST (CONTD)
Lieutenant Kaori Jessop and Sub-
Lieutenant Duck Jessop

Kaori smiles and nods a wordless greeting Duc shakes his
head and tightens his lips

DUC
Do not listen to this Limey Its
Duke Not Duck Duke As in —

He jumps down from the scaffolding and strikes a cowboy pose
aiming his finger like a pistol as he slips into John Wayne
as Rooster Cogburn (startlingly good)

DUC (CONT’D)
Fill your hand you son of a
bitch

He smiles broad and opens the pistol to invite a handshake
Raleigh takes it and nods firmly

DUC (CONT’D)
(to Pentecost)
He met his scrap heap yet
Raleigh tries to get a clear look at the second Jaeger
standing at the distant end of of the bay partially hidden
by scaffolding and cranes
PENTECOST
Hey yours will be lucky to last as
long as that Scrap heap the way
you treat it

DUC
Thats goddamn right

Pentecost leads Raleigh into a nearby
CAGE ELEVATOR

and shuts the door As they ride it down Raleigh doesnt
take his eyes off the second Jaeger The lift bottoms out on

THE MAIN FLOOR

where Pentecost and Raleigh exit Raleigh narrows his eyes at
the obscured mech something about the color intrigues him

RALEIGH
Hey what did he mean scrap heap

PENTECOST
No one told you Shes a Mark-1

( )

Raleigh starts to walk faster almost jogging across the
wide busy floor to get a clear look at the Jaeger

Finally a huge repair crane rolls away revealing the
Jaeger Raleighs mouth gapes at the sight of it

RALEIGH
(reverent)
Gipsy Danger

GIPSY DANGER -- Less humanoid than the Mark-2 burlier more
bestial with back-bending t-rex legs A monster for the
monsters Armor mottled smoky green and charcoal bearing the
proud scars of all the fights that failed to bring her down
A dinosaurian gladiator mighty iconic

PENTECOST
You know it

RALEIGH
Are you kidding I was fifteen I
knew all their names

Pentecost crosses his arms with a smirk as he watches Raleigh
stagger closer in an awed trance

RALEIGH (CONTD)
This was LAs first Jaeger This
was the reason we got to sleep at
night The reason I am what I am

He lays his palm on the armor and cranes his neck to marvel
at her history blazed in decals like a soldiers tattoos a
US flag a Bear Flag the Rising Sun the flag of Tokyo even
retro nose-art -- a buxom gypsy pinup riding a bomb

RALEIGH (CONTD)
I cant drive this This is like
Apollo Shes a monument She
should be in a museum

PENTECOST
They tell me shes got one or two
more fights left in her Do you

Raleigh smiles earnestly with an awed chuckle but before he
can answer a Japanese voice calls out

MAKO
Is that the American

Raleigh and Pentecost turn to find Mako standing on a catwalk

above She leans on the rail warily scrutinizing Raleigh
Pentecost answers in Japanese

( )

PENTECOST
Yes This is Raleigh Antrobus
(to Raleigh)
Your gunner -- Mako Mori
RALEIGH

Hi Good to meet you
Mako eyes him and crosses her arms

MAKO
Is he talking to me Sensei

PENTECOST
You want to come down and say
hello Lieutenant

It hits her -- He doesnt speak Japanese
MAKO
Would it make any difference what I

said to him Sensei

Pentecost sighs He has no response Mako gapes at him
astonished by the implications of this oversight

MAKO (CONT’D)
What are we even doing here

Pentecost is at a loss Mako turns and speeds away Raleigh
stares into the empty space where Mako had just been
standing daunted by the realization --

RALEIGH
She doesnt speak English

Pentecost sighs and throws Raleigh a wry told-you-so grin
EXT DOJO -- NIGHT

The old-style pagoda stands in contrast to the other
futuristic structures of the command complex perched near

the edge of island overlooking the Bay and Tokyo beyond

PENTECOST (PRE-LAP)
Language is not thought

INT DOJO TRAINING HALL -- CONTINUOUS

A high atrium-ceiling over a gleaming hardwood floor painted
with a deep scarlet circle throwing red slashes out across
the pale brown planks evoking Japans rising sun emblem
On the circle Raleigh and Mako stand opposite one another in

their standard-issue track suits as Pentecost muses
alternating between English and subtitled Japanese

( )

PENTECOST
You dont speak the same language
So what Youre brain-to-brain in
the Pons Youre in where thoughts
happen Dont sweat the doorman

RALEIGH
So should we log some Pons time

PENTECOST
Walk before you run Lieutenant

LATER -- FIRST EXERCISE

Blindfolded Mako and Raleigh stand on opposite sides of a
table on which sits a scale precariously balanced with neatly
stacked weights on each tray Pentecost watches

PENTECOST (CONTD)
The Jaegers a huge machine It
takes two brains to move her Like
a dinosaur Every step every
gesture is a concert of two minds

With their right hands they meticulously maneuver a new
weight to their respective trays their left hands hold their
partner’s wrist tracking the opposite weight’s progress

Simultaneously they gently deposit their weights The
balance wobbles slightly but holds

They each pick up the next weight The movements play out as
before but this time Raleigh arrives slightly early

The scales teeter and fail spilling the weights
Mako removes her blindfold and sighs frustrated
LATER -- ANOTHER EXERCISE

Mako and Raleigh stand a good distance apart juggling a pair
of sake bottles between them

Pentecost shouts a signal and after they both nod he tosses
a third bottle into the stream

PENTECOST (CONTD)
You must be willing to blur the
seams between your souls
(to Raleigh)
You must become more than partners
You must become a mosaic A union

They manage to keep all three in the air (clearly this is
some version of an exercise they’ve each done before)

( )

Pentecost signals another bottle Raleigh affirms just as
Mako refuses and when the bottle enters the stream Mako
misses the catch Several bottles SHATTER on the floor

Mako paces away in frustration and circles back to reprimand
Raleigh in Japanese

MAKO
Whats wrong with you Did I look
like I was ready

RALEIGH
Whatd she say

STILL LATER -- LAST EXERCISE
Pentecost opens a weapons trunk Mako mutters

MAKO
This isnt working Sensei Wash-
out cadets have more chemistry
What else can be done

PENTECOST
You will acquaint yourselves as
warriors have for centuries

He opens a trunk He smiles and tosses them each a staff

PENTECOST (CONTD)
Just like the Academy Lets spar

He crosses his arms Raleigh and Mako tentatively turn to
each other Mako throws the first strike a formal move
Raleigh blocks Pentecost talks as they spar

Raleigh swings Mako doesnt block in time He connects with
her shoulder She glares at him He seems a bit surprised

PENTECOST (CONT’D)
Easy Its a dialogue Not a fight
Get in her head
(to Mako)
Watch him Whats he thinking

The bout goes on slow at first each taking turns -- strike
block strike dodge Pentecost circles them as he speaks

PENTECOST (CONTD)
Theres a vocabulary here Remark
Reply Pay attention
(to Mako)
Youre learning his reflexes
Lieutenant His instincts

( )

Mako swings and HITS Raleighs shin before he can jump
Raleigh glances at Pentecost who just smirks and shrugs

PENTECOST (CONT’D)
Even I saw that one coming

Makos intensity escalates with each blow -- each a little
faster and harder than the one before

Mako unleashes a flurry of attacks on Raleigh He struggles
to parry Pentecost notices the wild look in Makos eyes

PENTECOST (CONTD)
Youre fighting him Mori

She JABS her staff into his gut He doubles over She swings
and CRACKS it across Raleighs face loosening his balance

PENTECOST (CONTD)
Lieutenant Mori stand down

She spins the last strike into a KICK that sweeps Raleighs
legs out from under him knocking him to the ground She
pulls back ready to drive her staff through his skull

PENTECOST (CONTD)
Mako

She finally stops standing over Raleigh her staff clenched
his her white knuckles tears streaming from her angry eyes

EXT DOJO -- LATER

Mako sits on a bench overlooking the water staring at
Tokyos glittering skyline across the harbor Raleigh
staggers up holding an ice pack to his eye

She only glances as he sits beside her quickly turning back
to the skyline before her guilt runs away with her

RALEIGH
Might be a good sign My brother
used to kick my ass all the time

After a long silence Mako finally speaks They dont
understand one another but Raleigh just lets her talk

MAKO
I keep telling myself to try
harder but Ive never had to try
It just worked Its not like Aki
and I were kin or lovers (He had a
bit of a crush on Duc actually)

(beat)
(MORE )

( )

MAKO (CONTD)
He was just the neighbors kid --
until one day I turned around and
he was the only friend Id known my
whole life I never had to try

Raleigh pulls the ice pack off his eye and Mako finally turns
to him grimly astonished to see the shiner she left him

RALEIGH
Is it bad Its bad isnt it

MAKO
(laughing)
Holy shit we are going to die
EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD -- DAY
A rusty truck plies a muddy lane carved into a sheer cliff

INT TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS

Flick sits in the back seat huddled away from the precipice
The cab JOSTLES along the jagged contours of the road

The engine SNARLS with effort as the implacable DRIVER pushes
it ever upward into the shifting alpine fog

Flick cranes her neck to steal a peek out the cliff-side
door careful not to shift her weight

Outside the tires skirt the ragged ferns clinging to the
edge where the ground plunges down into a soup of clouds

EXT CALIXTO PARTICLE OBSERVATORY -- LATER

The truck pulls up to a cylindrical windowless building
rising above the misty lichen-crusted rocks The Driver lets
Flick out at the oddly plain-looking structure

SUPER Calixto Particle Observatory -- Lima Region Peru

The truck HONKS a farewell to Flick and drives away Flick
holds her jacket close Its not raining not exactly but
the thick mountaintop mist drenches her as if it were

INT MAIN CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

Flick enters the dim hallway relieved to be in from the
cold No sound save for the BUZZ of fluorescent lights and
the ghostly CROONING of the wind outside

She spots a man come out into the hallway and linger

engrossed by his clipboard He wears headphones listening to
music He hasnt noticed her

( )

Hes NEWT GOTLIEB -- a lanky unkempt academic with
scruffy brown hair and an impish grin Geekishly cute in his
own peculiar way Flick attempts to get his attention

FLICK
Excuse me
(he doesnt hear)
Excuse me

Finally he looks up and takes off the headphones

FLICK (CONTD)
I got an e-mail from someone here
in reference to an article Im --

NEWT
Youre Felicity Kincaid
FLICK
You can call me Flick And you

must be gotliebcalixtoorg

NEWT
No No Im not

She glances at nametag on his lanyard Gotlieb

NEWT (CONT’D)
What are you doing here

FLICK
You e-mailed me “I have info
relevant to your investigation”
That’s what you said

NEWT
I figured you probably got stuff
like that all the time

FLICK
I don’t How substantial is it

NEWT
I don’t know But I know COSDEC’s
got it too and I know they don’t
talk about it

FLICK
All the more reason to have this
conversation in person right

He turns to go

He relents

( )

NEWT
Stay here I’1l be right back
Don’t touch any--
(beat)
No Actually could you follow me
for a sec

INT RESEARCH OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

In the messy office space we find Newt whispering with a
stout bespectacled scientist MYRON TOYNBEE Flick waits

TOYNBEE
You e-mailed a reporter

NEWT
I don’t know what I was thinking

After a moment Toynbee grudgingly confesses --

TOYNBEE
I’m glad you did

NEWT
They haven’t taken this public
They’11 know where it came from

TOYNBEE
We don’t know that it’s classified

NEWT
We don’t know it isn’t

FLICK
Guys I’ve been on this for almost
a year and I’m in the weeds Youre
my only lead You know it’s
important Please just gimme
something I can start from some
shred of a foothold Or I’m stuck

INT ARCHIVES -- DAY

Big supercomputer cabinets HUM as a SKIRLING dot matrix
printer spits out endless sheets of data Other spools of
tractor-feed paper line the wall-to-wall shelves

Flick and Toynbee wait as Newt climbs a ladder to retrieve a
particular roll from the top shelf Flick takes notes

NEWT

Eleven years ago I was interning
here under Doctor Ivo Czerny

( )

TOYNBEE
Czerny was running a big quantum
gravity survey

NEWT
And one day we found this

He pulls out the spool he was looking for climbs down the
ladder and unrolls the paper for Flick to see

The paper is covered with row after row of numbers One row
near the middle of the sheet is highlighted but its hard to
see why Flick shakes her head

FLICK
What am I looking at

NEWT
The hottest graviton signal ever
detected

FLICK
Is that strange

Newt rolls a whiteboard up to draw a broad circle He draws
concentric waves radiating from the circle

NEWT
Its the kind of exotic matter we
search the cosmos for This just
materialized in our own backyard

He flips the board over to a dry-erase world map He writes a
question mark in the middle of the Pacific and circles it
with widening concentric waves

NEWT (CONTD)
A huge dark matter footprint right
in the middle of the Pacific It
was practically screaming at us

TOYNBEE
There was nothing there that could
put out a signal like that

FLICK
When you say signal --

NEWT
Like how radio waves carry radio
signals but written in gravity

He flips the board to draw an RKO-style radio tower beside

the circle He draws radio waves spreading from the top of
the tower and points to the waves spreading from the circle

( )

FLICK
But somebody built the radio
tower

Newt and Toynbee exchange a weighty look

TOYNBEE
There was an almost artificial
regularity to it Czerny called it
some alien intellect

FLICK
Aliens

NEWT
Not in the sense youre thinking
Not aliens from somewhere out in
the universe Aliens from another
universe A parallel universe

TOYNBEE
There was a logorithmic pattern
embedded in the transmission -

FLICK
Okay lets try to remember I dont
have a degree in this

NEWT
It was like a countdown
(beat)
And it ended on November 9th 2012

FLICK
Osaka

NEWT
Exactly The very first kaiju And
suddenly there was a gaping hole
smack in the middle of the Pacific
at the exact epicenter of the
signal wed been tracking

TOYNBEE
How fast do you think Czerny got
COSDECs attention with that one

NEWT
He gets a call one day Drops
everything and goes out to Midway

FLICK
He works for Sci-Division

TOYNBEE
Worked for Sci-Division

( )

NEWT
They exiled him to the middle of
the Australian Outback

FLICK
I dont understand What happened

NEWT
Nobody knows what happens at
Midway But last time we spoke he
dropped some hints that he was
close to a breakthrough Said it
would turn the tide

FLICK
What kind of a breakthrough

NEWT
Couldnt say Whatever it was it
never made it up the chain of
command They locked it down I
dunno -- Maybe they didnt get it
Maybe they didnt believe him
Maybe he was wrong

FLICK
You dont think he was wrong

NEWT
Without knowing what he was working
on or what he found --
(reconsidering his answer)
He was never wrong

A bold statement Flick takes a deep breath

EXT HOTEI

FLICK

If youre right these things were
sent here Its not an accident
Its a war Theyre coming faster

(leaning forward)
And somewhere out in the world is a
man you think knows how to stop it
Why didnt you tell anyone

NEWT
I just did

L MIRAFLORES -- NIGHT

Flick gets out of a cab and heads into her hotel

INT HOTEI

L HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Flick walks to her room thinking She stops and takes a few
steps back She sees the newspaper on the floor outside one
of the rooms She reaches down to pick it up

( )

The headline Los Angeles Pilot to Drive Tokyo Jaeger
INT HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Flick is already on the phone

FLICK
Newt Its Flick Hey where
exactly did you say Czerny was

NEWT
Well I dunno how far you wanted to
go for this article but --

FLICK
Its not an article Not any more

EXT MIRAFLORES -- DAY

Atop seaside bluffs the high-rises and parks of Limas
affluent coastal district glow in the warm sun

INT HOTEL MIRAFLORES -- DAY

Flick stands at the reception desk beside her bags Her
shoulder presses her mobile to her ear as she tries to check
out and buy plane tickets at the same time

FLICK
Yeah something came up Im
checking out early
(into phone)
Sydney Or Melbourne Just -- I
need a flight to Australia

Across the lobby Newt enters off the street looking lost
He cranes his to scan the casual crowd of GUESTS He searches
and finally spots Flick at the front desk He beams

NEWT
Hey I caught you

Finished with both her transactions Flick hangs up and
turns a bit surprised to see Newt

FLICK
What are you doing here
NEWT
Well I was thinking -- Youre

going to need some help

FLICK
Youre bold all of a sudden

( )

NEWT
I got you into this I feel like I
need to own up to that

FLICK
I got myself into this

NEWT
I held the door open

EXT HOTEL MIRAFLORES -- DAY

The front of the hotel overlooks the Pacific from the top of
the seaside bluffs Newt follows Flick out through the
outdoor cafe that spills onto the sidewalk

FLICK
I absolve you of accountability

NEWT
Thanks Im still tagging along

FLICK
Newt I know youre worried about
me And thats sweet but --

NEWT
Look Im going to see my old
friend Czerny If thats where
youre headed youre going to have
a hard time avoiding me

The long BANSHEE WAIL of a siren stills the carefree air
DINERS and PEDESTRIANS begin to scatter in all directions
Flick and Newt stand frozen in their tracks

NEWT (CONTD)
The kaiju siren

FLICK NEWT
A drill -- It cant be an No Its real Flick listen

NEWT (CONTD)
Its okay Listen Ive got a
scooter Were getting out of here

The traffic outside the cafe locks up Impatient DRIVERS
leave their cars and run clotting the thoroughfare with
abandoned autos Newt leads Flick to his Vespa

EXT MIRAFLORES STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

Newt threads the Vespa between the derelict traffic on the
bluff-top road Flick holds on and watches the ocean

( )

A mile or so out the sea bulges unnaturally Flick
unconsciously tightens her grip on Newt Her mouth opens but
she has trouble forming the words

FLICK
(whispering)
Its coming

The water breaks as the kaiju rises distant but huge -- ten
twenty then thirty stories tall Flick cant look away

Reporting name DENGUE Arachnoid legs bristling with hairs
Scores of black eyes above a wide reptilian grin Some unholy
fusion of tarantula and dragon An obscene alien spectacle

It stalks towards the shore in a slow but enormous gait that
closes the distance unexpectedly fast

NEWT
Holy shit

But its not the kaiju he sees Its something up ahead
Flick doesnt hear the ROAR of the V-50 Jumphawks until they
pass over dragging a wide shadow Flick looks up

We dont see their huge payload at first only the massive
shadow it casts over Flick and everything around her as the
Jumphawks lift it into position a few blocks away

The choppers release their cables and let the thing drop a
short distance to the ground Its weight THUNDERS the street
SHATTERING windows and tripping CAR ALARMS

And as the dust settles finally we see the titan rising
behind the nearest high-rises a new feature in the skyline
the Mark-2 Jaeger PUMA REAL Armor mottled khakifield-grey
urban camo The Peruvian flag emblazoned on its shoulder

The colossus comes alive as giant motors flex its joints with
a DEAFENING GROAN like a thousand cellos preparing

Dengue answers with a SAWMILL SNARL too loud to sound like
any animal The kaiju comes ashore crossing the beach in a
few wide steps before effortlessly cresting the bluff

Its towering spider legs scrabble for purchase on the bluffs
edge pulling down chunks of land (whole condos and all) as
the mountain of flesh hauls itself up to confront Puma Real

The kaiju swats the air with its long arachnid forelimbs
flinging off a cloud of bristly hairs Most settle on the
Jaeger prickling the armor like a forest of splinters

Some of the cloud breezes past the Jaeger sailing towards
us It seems harmless at first just a haze of drifting hairs

( )

But as they fall closer they look less and less like hairs
and more like a dense volley of arrows

FLICK
Look out

They fall as a lethal hail of ragged bio-spears on the
crowded street -- THUNK THUNK THUNK -- stabbing the pavement
lancing auto hoods skewering bystanders mid-step

Newt clumsily weaves the Vespa between the falling spears
narrowly missing a few

Up ahead a DESPERATE MAN steps from his skewered car his
eyes raw with animal fear as he trains a pistol on Newt who
has no other choice but to stop the scooter

The Desperate Man shouts in staccato Spanish thrusting his
gun Newt tries to calm him down in more uncertain Spanish
but the Man has all the patience of a frayed powerline

FLICK (CONTD)
Drive Just go

Newt pulls Flick off and surrenders the scooter to the Man --
who ZIPS away leaving Newt and Flick to flee on foot

FLICK (CONTD)
Why did you do that

Newt pulls her down the chaotic street shouting as they go

NEWT
We were a heartbeat from dead

FLICK
We still are

Flick looks over her shoulder as Newt drags her She watches
Dengue circle to a position between Puma Real and the street
back to the crowd a block or two closer than before

She almost trips over a dead body and has to look ahead She
doesnt see the Jaeger launch a volley of missiles

A handful EXPLODE on the kaiju The rest STREAK over the road
to blow out the top floor of a condo a couple miles ahead

Flick turns again still running

A deafening BOOM as Puma Real lands a hard blow across the
kaijus skull throwing up a fine red mist of gore

The gossamer red cloud drifts and falls in a torrential
downpour on the streets below utterly soaking Newt Flick
and everything around them in blood

( )

Dengue staggers back demolishing the very hotel Flick had
just been inside The cascade of rubble reminds her just how
close the battle is drifting

FLICK (CONTD)
Theyre getting closer

Newt turns and stops shocked by the proximity of it He runs
to the bluffs edge and motions for Flick

The air festers with NOISE the SCREAMS the HOWLING car
alarms the GROANING clamor of the Jaegers vast machinery
the window-rattling SNARL of the beast

NEWT
Come on

He leads her sliding partway down the bluff stopping where a
wide concrete pipe yawns open Newt takes Flicks hand and
lifts her into the drainage pipe

They find countless other BYSTANDERS huddled in the concrete
cave crammed back into the darkness

The pipe SHUDDERS and JOLTS dust spilling from its seams
Terrified SCREAMS echo in the darkness eclipsed by the
unthinkable NOISE of the battle overhead

Some suicidal curiosity tugs Flick towards the opening where
she cranes her head out and looks straight up catching a
humbling view of the fight - the impossible scale of it

The machine and the monster Towering Godlike Their feet
too close pulverizing cars on the street their heads
impossibly distant three hundred feet straight up

Shes close enough to see the kelp and plastic flotsam
tangled in the spike-hairs of its soaring arachnid legs

High overhead Dengue opens his skyscraping jaws to loose a
ROAR like Niagra Falls Puma Real aims its cannon down the
monsters throat and fires a THUNDERCRACK shot

The back of the kaijus head EXPLODES -- just as Newt grabs
Flick and pulls her back into the safety of the pipe

Outside a hail of meat and blood falls then a brief quiet

A great wall of flesh blurs past the pipe briefly filling
the view as the dead kaiju falls off the bluff

As relative silence settles Flick staggers out of the pipe
with Newt following closely after Below the body of Dengue
sprawls at the foot of the bluff

( )

Atop the bluff Puma Real stands impossibly tall its
shoulders and head fading into the glare of the sun It
powers down becoming once again as inert as a statue

The V-50s arrive hovering over the Jaeger preparing the
airlift Shaken bystanders spill out of the concrete pipe

Flick scrabbles up to the street SIRENS and LOUDSPEAKERS
begin to bleed into the silence of the aftermath

She looks over what was once the traffic jam now flattened
by scores of huge deep footprints metal packed and pressed
into the sagging fractured concrete

Her eyes follow the path of the devastation up the steet
where the twisted remains of high-rises slump under smoke-
filled gaps in the once lovely skyline

She stands in the devastation soaked in blood trembling
hollowed out by the shock of it - the capricious scale of
this urban scar Newt lays a comforting hand on her shoulder

INT AEROPUERTO INTERNACIONAL JORGE CHAVEZ -- NIGHT

A crowded terminal bustling with TRAVELERS desperate to get
out of Lima Every TV plays news reports of the attack

Flick sits at the gate staring ahead dead-eyed Shes
changed into clean clothes but faint traces of dry kaiju
blood fleck the edge of her scalp

Newt passes Flick a cup of coffee as he sits beside her

NEWT
You okay

FLICK
Hm Yeah Im fine

She doesnt want to talk about it and Newt doesnt want to
wear out his welcome so he clams up and opens a book Flick
shakes her head apparently it wants to be talked about

FLICK (CONTD)

Its -- Its kinda ridiculous
Ive never seen it happen Just in
tapes Ive never been there in
person Can you believe that

(a chill)
Its like the world isnt the place
you thought it was

She trails off losing herself to her thousand yard stare

Her attention drifts to a nearby TV where a graph starkly
illustrates the sharp rise in attacks

( )

The cockpit a seat in a nest of cables Raleigh sits ina
shoulder harness signal lines ported into his drivesuit his
body embedded deep in the seats gel-filled shock padding -
almost cozy in an intensely claustrophobic way

His arms tucked deep into hefty drum-like control-sleeves
flanking the seat A bundle of fibre optic wires trails like
raw nerves from a port just behind his ear lobe

Ahead of him we see what he sees - a wide IMAX view of the
outside world (projected straight into his brain) as if the
pod has no front wall

The sky the interchange and the freeway hundreds of feet
below translucent data drifts through the augmented reality
gauges dials and digital targeting geometry

GHOSTLY VOICES and DREAMY ECHOES haunt the air familiar and
unfamiliar Japanese and English fractured conversations in
the aether Ambient thoughts always there on some level

Suddenly something huge plows through the interchange
collapsing the tangled ribbons of freeway a spectacle of
muscle surging towards us through billowing concrete dust
We see Raleighs right arm tense in its control sleeve

Mako watches the monster in her IMAX-HUD

SLATTERN boasts a shape like an armless carnosaur a thick
serpentine body on mighty raptorial legs A head vaguely like
a moray eel A long tail barbed at the end

It draws patient predatory circles around us lean and

powerful as a panther scales shifting between jet black and
iridescent blue in the fog-stifled light

Seeming almost too agile to be so big but the haze in the

air the highway and the abandoned cars small as toys --
remind us of its titanic size

YOUNG MAKO
He just went out for a minute

Outside the distant sounds of CHOPPERS SIRENS and a
throbbing RUMBLE Young Mako tentatively approaches the tall
windows overlooking the city

Distant choppers train searchlights on something lumbering

through the skyline Behind it the city bleeds columns of
smoke from the light-less scar of its wake

buildings -- long and crocodilian scabrously armored with
rugged scales and scutes

She looks over her shoulder to Raleigh her eyes quivering

YOUNG MAKO (CONTD)

In the distance Trespasser throws his head back and roars
silent as a distant flash of lightning

We see the soundwave spread over Osaka shattering windows as
it speeds towards us even after the beast closes its jaws

Finally the delayed ROAR blows out the windows and THUNDERS
through the apartment throwing Young Mako back

EXT FREEWAY -- DAY (PRESENT)

Suddenly Slattern lunges from the smoky curtain before the
Jaeger can react The mech falls and CRATERS the asphalt
Slattern perches atop the fallen mech and RIPS into his prey
INT CONN-POD 2 -- CONTINUOUS
On the wraparound projection we see Slattern standing right

on top of us his barbed tail jabbing down like a scorpion
until the whole IMAX view flickers to static

back strangely more frustrated than terrified

wild He reaches behind his ear to disconnect the Pons

The instant he unplugs the wire the dome of static dissolves
into the blank front of the cramped cockpit

Pentecost enters the barrel-shaped chamber with a clipboard
under his arm A big steel hemisphere fills the center of the
floor with cables and pistons rising to the ceiling
Hydraulics lift the dome uncovering the two cockpits back-

Raleigh and Mako peel their helmets off They remain seated
staring in opposite directions frustrated and drained

He squats about to impart his feedback before realizing the
futility they both already know how bad they did

One-hundred-seventeen Eighty-

numbers mean anything to you

TAKADA
They are the attack intervals

You see why this pattern is
somewhat alarming The latest
incident in Lima came just
seventeen days after Tokyo

TAKADA
I share the panels concern

JIAO
Is the offensive escalating

TAKADA
Our enemies are on the far side of
the Interstice I have no way of
anticipating their strategy

JIAO

Were there not reports that a

Doctor Ivo Czerny had a way to
eavesdrop on the the other side

TAKADA
Czerny was dangerously unstable
Hes no longer with Sci-Division

( )

BENVENISTE

And his research Did he have a way

to see through the Interstice

TAKADA
Its not clear his test subjects
(the ones that survived) grasped
what it was they were seeing

LETHBRIDGE

Commander the bottom line for this

panel is ensuring that COSDEC is
working towards a strategic end
Bearing that in mind in your own
words -- What is victory

TAKADA
The Mark-3 will --

LETHBRIDGE
The Mark-3 program is over-budget
and stalled in development Again

You know what all the survivors
have in common The last time they
drove a Jaeger it was on the worst
day of their life These are
broken people sir

TAKADA
Well you need to un-break them The
way our downtime keeps shrinking
things could turn ugly any minute

INT SHATTERDOME -- DAY

Raleigh and Duc

play basketball at a goal that’s been wheeled

out onto the floor Sunlight bathes the Jaegers behind them

DUC
How’s swim lessons with the shark
I hear you guys plugged in

RALEIGH
Not fun Were a tactical mess And
the drifts are confusing as hell

DUC
You ghost-drifting yet

RALEIGH
Like outside the Pons No I’m not
even sure that’s possible Has a
crew been any more mismatched

Duc shoots The ball BOUNCES off the rim -- and hits an
ordinance on a passing cart TENDO CHOI the chief engineer

shouts at

Duc from behind the wheel

TENDO
Wed be dead if these had juice
Youre lucky theyre just kinetics

DUC
Sorry Tendo

TENDO
We dont have a gym

DUC
Not with these views What can I
say You keep the girls so pretty

He turns and gets back into the game trash-talking Raleigh

DUC (CONT’D)
Well he keeps mine pretty What
do you see in that old Mark-1

Raleigh makes a basket He tucks the ball under his arm and
gestures towards Gipsy Danger

RALEIGH
I dunno That’s pretty cool

A crane lifts Tendo’s bloc of projectiles and SNAPS it to the
gun barrel on the mech’s arm -- a context that reveals them
to be not missiles but rather giant person-sized bullets

DUC
What No All that shit slows you
down The Mark-2’s all gigawatts
Light as a thunderbolt

Raleigh smirks and checks the ball to Duc

RALEIGH
So she’s from Osaka

DUC
Mako She was in Osaka

RALEIGH
The first kaiju attack

Duc scores a goal and snatches up the ball taking a break to
paint Raleigh the picture

DUC
Get this -- her dad goes to the
store at 700 at 746 -- shit hits
the fan She never sees him again

They resume the game talking as they play

RALEIGH
Jesus Ive never met a survivor

DUC
There arent a lot a lot of them

RALEIGH
How many kills does she have

DUC
Mako None technically

( )

RALEIGH
That was her first live run

DUC
Shes a beast I promise you You
should see her sim runs Textbook
Nobody screwed up out there It was
just one of those things

RALEIGH
Shes hard to connect with

DUC
Takes two to tango right

He shoots The ball SWISHES into the basket

PENTECOST
We ran five sims You died And you
cant spar without making a brawl

each other than fighting KJs

( )

RALEIGH
Its a long damn way from fighting
KJs Sensei

PENTECOST
Youre a long way from fighting
KJs A KJ thinks with one mind

MAKO
Sensei please This is
humiliating A first-week recruit
doesnt have to play these games

PENTECOST
Its not a problem first week

already come in pairs
(beat)

You two are strangers Its not
your fault But it will get you
killed if youre still strangers
when the siren sounds

He slides a record from its sleeve

PENTECOST (CONTD)
You need to get close

He drops the needle and a song spills into the air --
Siouxsie and the Banshees The Last Beat of My Heart

He holds her lower back and she clutches his shoulder as they
clasp hands and follow the footprints The slow music makes
it easy but they keep their eyes on the steps

Spare and spectral Low drums Haunting accordion Siouxsie
plaintively sings In the sharp gust of love My memory
stirred When time wreathed a rose A garland of shame

We hear drifting voices from memory as they dance

YANCY (VO)
I dont know what to tell you
Rals I fell for her Im sorry

This is what happens when crewmates experience a drift
outside the Pons Its called a ghost-drift

EXT LEO CARRILLO STATE BEACH -- NIGHT (GHOST-DRIFT)

Waves slap the ragged rocks Raleigh and Yancy stand on the
precipice above in the blazing headlights of a parked truck

RALEIGH
You fell for her Like an anchor I
guess the guy at the end of your
chain just has to hold his breath

( )

YANCY
What do you need me to do Rals

RALEIGH
I need you to get out of my head

He spins to face his brother - only to find Yancy is not
there Raleigh stands alone on the rocks

BACK TO PRESENT

Makos hand tightens on his shoulder a reflex She winces
but keeps dancing Neither dares to meet the others eyes

The ethereal music leads them in tense wandering circles
The ghost-drift sweeps over them in a storm of images and
sounds fragments chaotically tumbling over one another

MONTAGE -- GHOST-DRIFT

-- The Jaeger COYOTE TANGO stands in the shallow surf near
the Santa Monica Pier Blood-red dusk spreads from the
setting sun Gore-stained water streaks the wide beach

FLICK (VO)
You ever have a nightmare too awful
to talk about Rals

-- Further out something rises Bloody seawater streams down
its craggy back like water off a mountain

-- In Osaka Young Mako stands at her window watching the
kaiju Trespasser ravage the city

YOUNG MAKO
Hes not coming back

-- In his old mobile home Raleigh stares into his bathroom
mirror his eyes red and ragged with despair

-- Raleigh pulls his fist back and punches the mirror
leaving the fracture we remember

-- Off the Santa Monica Pier TORTUGA faces Coyote Tango
Hulking and turtle-like carapace studded with jagged rows of
bony plates It opens its trifurcated beak and SCREAMS

YANCY (VO)
What do you need me to do Rals

RALEIGH (VO)
I need you to get out of my head

-- In the ruined streets of Tokyo Mako strains to squirm
free of the Men in HAZMAT suits holding her back No sound

( )

MAKO (VO)
The silence Thats the worst

-- Silent slow motion Tortuga charges Coyote Tango plowing
up an angry foam that hangs in the air

MAKO (VO)
You dont remember what silence is
until it comes flooding back

-- Tortuga opens his three-part beak and from his throat a
harpoon-sharp tongue launches like a viper to stab deep into
the Jaegers mechanical chest

RALEIGH (VO)
You wanna know I did all I could

-- Again we see Mako reaching for the wrecked Jaeger

RALEIGH (VO)
I dunno Probably not

BACK TO PRESENT

Raleigh stares into space as they dance dwelling on his
guilt He glances down and notices Mako looking right up at
him her eyes softened with an empathic sadness

They keep dancing and without a word Mako rests her head on
Raleighs shoulder as the band sings Til the last beat
Til the last fleeting beat Of my heart

Pentecost watches from the shadows He nods to himself and
lets out a small sigh of relief

TO BLACK
INT DOJO CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (GHOST-DRIFTDREAM)

From Raleighs POV we drift down the dark wood-floored
hallway passing opaque paper windows

INT DOJO TRAINING HALL -- NIGHT (GHOST-DRIFTDREAM)

Raleigh finds Mako alone in the training hall dancing by
herself as if with an invisible partner

She looks up from the footsteps on the floor and sees
Raleigh She speaks perfect English

MAKO
We should practice the steps Well
be tested soon

Raleigh replies in subtitled Japanese Nevertheless they
seem to comprehend each other

( )

RALEIGH
Im no good with tests I used to
cheat off my brother

MAKO
Thats not cheating Thats just
depending on someone

She reaches out her hand

MAKO (CONTD)
Dance with me

Raleigh takes her hand and the music swells not Siouxsie a
deep BASE PULSING like a heart

SIREN VOICES trace strange Japanese harmonies chased by the
PERCUSSIVE PLUCKING of a shamisen (an old Japanese lute)
Dreamy and sharp a tense sensual rhythm

They hold each other as if waltzing but without seeing
their feet it seems as if the room is spinning around them

RALEIGH
Its not quite right

MAKO
We should be closer

RALEIGH
It only works when were close

They look deep into each others eyes as they draw closer

Tight on their faces as their bodies touch Each draws a gasp
of surprise without looking down They dont have to

We see why -- their clothes are suddenly gone Skin to skin
Their intimacy hidden pressed between them Goosebumps
prickle their bare torsos

MAKO
Is that too close

He shakes his head as the dojo spins and finally becomes

A GROVE OF CHERRY BLOSSOMS

stirred by an heavy storm clouds Silent lightning cracks the
sky Falling petals course through the whirling veins of

wind They hold one anothers gaze oblivious to all else

RALEIGH
Well be tested soon

MAKO
Well be ready

( )

Their lips touch and open A kiss slow and cool The world
spins faster around them The wind strengthens

The trees shed pale pink petals twirling through the air in
urgent eddies to envelope the two kissing bodies blurring
with a glow that swells to bleach the whole scene
TO WHITE
INT RALEIGHS ROOM -- NIGHT
Raleigh opens his eyes startled awake by the dream
INT MAKOS ROOM -- NIGHT
Mako jolts up holding her chest as she catches her breath
INTERCUT RALEIGHMAKO
Raleigh sits on the edge of his bed planting his feet on the
floor wondering -- Was that both of us or just me He
glances up at his door as if expecting a knock
Mako sits in bed taking stock of the dream
Raleigh gets out of bed and heads for his door
Mako presses her eye to her peephole
Raleigh opens his door to find Makos door closed
Mako watches him through her peephole
Raleigh lifts his knuckles about to knock on Makos door

Mako cant help but smile to herself as she watches him
pause just inches away

Raleigh stops He rethinks it and finally folds his arms
Unsure of what he might say He turns back to his room

His indecision teases a snicker from Makos growing smile - a
small sound but Raleigh stops mid-step and she quickly
stifles her amusement - Did he hear that
Raleigh glances over his shoulder to take one last look at
Makos door - He thought he heard something He waits and
finally retreats to his room
Mako rests her back against the door

FADE TO
DARKNESS punctuated by a blur of multi-colored lights

Such a perfect day

We hear dreamy CARNIVAL MUSIC as the lights sharpen --

EXT SANTA MONICA PIER -- SUNSET (DREAM)

Huddled close together Yancy and Flick ride the seaside

Ferris wheel

FLICK
I remember it so clearly

YANCY
Yeah What happened next

FLICK
You had the guy stop us at the top
so you could ask me

The Ferris wheel stops just as their gondola reaches the
pinnacle The sunset paints the Pier and the ocean in

dazzling shades of purple and orange Flick smiles

YANCY
And you said

FLICK
I couldnt say anything I just
kissed you

YANCY
I took it as a yes

FLICK
What if I said no

YANCY
Oh he wasnt going to let us down
without my signal I was pretty
sure I could talk you into it

They both laugh and Flick cozies up to him Her smile starts
to fade as some part of her begins to realize it’s not real

FLICK
I used to love this place I
havent been back since --

She hears a deafening ROAR and turns to see another memory

playing out in the water just off the Pier --

Two vast figures clashing in the surf the kaiju Tortuga

charges the Jaeger Coyote Tango

Dread washes over Flicks face as she watches

The kaiju opens its three-part beak and launches its harpoon-
tongue The moment the speared tip sinks into the mechs

armor the whole vista freezes Time stops

( )

Flick cant look away from the tragic instant

FLICK (CONTD)
Make it stop Yance

YANCY

Only you can make it stop
FLICK

How
YANCY

Just get off the ride

He smirks and vaults out of the gondola She lunges for him
but as she reaches over the edge --

-- he’s gone Not falling Not on the ground Just gone
Flick looks around and realizes the whole Pier is deserted

Stranded atop the Ferris wheel her searching eyes fall again
on that frozen moment out in the still water Tortuga
stabbing the Jaeger and her desperation mounts

FLICK
Yancy

She calls after him as she leans over the edge of the
gondola frantically searching the ground so far below

FLICK (CONTD)
Yancy Where are --

The gondola door suddenly pops open under her weight She
falls through the air --

TO BLACK
We hear a RHYTHMIC CLATTER in the dark

Newt turns on the lights and we find ourselves --
INT SLEEPING CAR -- NIGHT

Flick rubs her head and looks up from the floor of the small
rail-car as Newt climbs out of his berth

NEWT
You fell out of your bunk

FLICK
It was a nightmare

( )

Newt gently as helps her into a chair He plants himself on
the floor in front of her and roots through a first aid kit
He tucks her hair aside to get a look at the cut on her head

NEWT
Doesn’t look too bad

He soaks a cotton in peroxide and dabs it on her forehead a
tenderness Flick seems to resent

NEWT (CONTD)
What was it about

FLICK
(lying)
I cant remember

She watches him hard and close He doesnt notice She tries
to remain silent but finally her thoughts just spill out

FLICK (CONTD)
It’s never going to happen Newt

NEWT
What’s never going to happen

She gives him a look -- You know exactly what He looks
down from the cut meeting her eyes and catching her meaning

He doesn’t reply right away He just gingerly adheres the
bandaid to her forehead careful to hold her hair out of the
way He turns to pack up the first aid kit

NEWT (CONTD)
I’m just trying to help

He doesn’t look at her He puts the first aid kit away and
finds in the cabinet a mylar bag of something She watches
him load the coffee maker puzzled

FLICK
Coffee Its 3AM

NEWT
Yeah but you shouldnt go back to
sleep You might have a concussion
or something I was gonna stay up
Flick nods frowning She looks away ashamed of herself

FLICK
Where are we

NEWT
Basically nowhere

Flick stares out into the jet-black landscape of the Outback
unmarred by the frailest shred of city light

highway crossing the arid landscape

SUPER On the outskirts of Loongana -- Nullarbor Plain

Quonset huts a mummified husk of a former mining settlement

FLICK
This can’t be it

They both spot the sign dusted with red earth hanging over
the front gate “THE ESCHATON INSTITUTE

NEWT
No this is it

EXT THE ESCHATON INSTITUTE -- CONTINUOUS

A man waits in the shade of what looks like an old bus stop
just outside the entrance to the settlement He stands as the
jeep pulls up watching Newt and Flick climb out

IVO CZERNY a silver-haired academic with weary eyes and
a charismatic smile august and articulate suspiciously
devoid of any obvious eccentricities

CZERNY

Newt smiles and approaches his former mentor Czerny opens
his arms to embrace Newt in a warm back-slapping bear-hug

He takes their bags and leads them through the front gate
onto the grounds of a rundown outback plantation They head
towards a sagging dust-stained Victorian house

CZERNY (CONTD)
I must say your timing is somewhat
serendipitous
INT MAIN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

A TV plays in the musty parlour Flick Newt and Czerny
gather around

Between the hiccups in the temperamental reception we catch
glimpses of the live footage a Jaeger battling a kaiju

INT LOUNGE -- DAY

Duc perches on the edge of his seat watching a different
news report on the same attack Raleigh has just wandered in

DUC
There was an attack South Korea

On the TV we see the kaiju -- a mountain of crustacean
armor like an outsized mole crab or woodlouse

It sits motionless at the end of an arrow-straight trail of
destruction cutting into the city

( )

RALEIGH
Is it over

DUC
Well they slammed it with energy
volleys - ion pulses wave lasers
the works but

He trails off listening to the news But Raleigh cant glean
the thrust of the non-English report

RALEIGH
But what --

DUC
Sorry It blew out this huge EMP
like it had been sucking up every
gigawatt Knocked out power all
over Busan their Jaeger included
Which was fine when it looked like
it killed itself in the process
except now theres some kind of --

Raleigh steps closer to the TV his brow furrowed

RALEIGH
What the hell is that

On the tv the news chopper frantically zooms in trying to
focus on the kaiju Under its semi-translucent carapace
something writhes and shifts

DUC
Theres something alive inside it

RALEIGH
Another KJ

The monsters armored back starts to bulge and split open
Long spindly legs force their way out The thing inside lets
out a chilling SCREAM as it starts to squirm free

Suddenly alert klaxons BRAY urgently in the halls and Duc
bolts for the door --

DUC
Saw that one coming

But he stops in his tracks when he hears the announcement --

Duc turns to Raleigh who can scarcely believe it himself

INT HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Raleigh bursts out into the hall just as Mako pokes her head
out a few doors down They exchange a deeply stunned look --
Holy shit thats us

Without exchanging a single word they both scramble down the
hall as the KLAXONS blare

INT CHANGEROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Mako and Raleigh quickly undress much too anxious to be
bashful or titillated Mako mumbles to herself

They pull on their drivesuits single-piece form-fitting
neoprene jumpsuits laced with intricate webs of fiber optics
and studded with an array of data ports

They both strap on their helmets and give the signal The
canopy on the conn-pods slides closed sealing them in their
self-contained control capsules

The loading arms CLATTER up the tower hoisting the conn-pods
up to their loading positions on the Jaeger

The lower arm swings to deposit Makos pod on the Jaegers
spine which hangs out like a ramp to draw the pod inside the
torso before closing over it The armor BUCKLES shut

A friendly TONE precedes a soothing DIGITAL VOICE

Just as Raleigh plugs the Ponss mainline into the port
behind his ear the front of the cockpit melts away to the
three-sixty projection of the outside

All of Tokyo unfolds below him as the Jumphawks lift the
Jaeger out of Shatterdome

He feels Mako wire into the Pons with a shrill FEEDBACK
SQUEAL and a swell of AMBIENT VOICES Their anxiety fuels the
dissonant cacophony of memories MURMURING in the background

The rain pours as the kaiju INVIDIA stalks through the fresh
devastation A spindly mantid shape tall as a skyscraper

She twists her viper-like head to HISS at a squad of fighter
jets She lashes out with her mantis-arms as the jets SCREAM
by unloading a hail of BOMBS that only annoy the beast

With the shape of Gipsy Danger growing larger and darker in
the rain-smeared sky the jets bank away leaving the fight
to the pros

She unfolds a set of long translucent wings

Her wings beat so fast that they seem to wave very slow not
enough to get the monster off the ground but enough to make
her more nimble than something of her size should be

Her THRUMMING wings VIBRATE the buildings like a tuning fork
and stir up transient vortexes strong as tornados flinging
cars and buses about before dissipating

rounds each big enough to SHATTER a car CUTTING a swathe of
devastation as it swivels to track the kaiju

But Invidia evades the fire dancing around the plumes of
shrapnel with the aid of her BUZZING wings

The gun ROARS punching craters in the street and slicing
through an office building but not catching the fleet-footed
Invidia before she FLITS out of sight too fast

Out of sight the DRONE of the monsters wings provide the
only hint of her trajectory

Gipsy Danger shuffles her huge mechanical legs to track the
supposed path of the kaiju built for brute strength and
naked power simply too slow to match the beasts movements

The DRONING grows SHUDDERING nearby buildings -- Invidia is
getting closer

A few blocks away she draws a predatory circle around Gipsy
Danger skittering over and between the boxy urban terrain

The Jaeger turns slowly clockwise trying to zero in on the
sound as Invidia remains easily outside the periphery

Trespasser throws open his jaws in a silent roar and Raleigh
sets his jaw and marches towards Young Mako with purpose

Outside the roars sound-wave rips through high-rises as it
spreads closer

Raleigh stands beside Young Mako at the window and offers his
hand She looks up at him uncertain but finally she takes
it a critical connection --

mounted cannon on Invidia

INT CONN-POD ROMA-2 -- CONTINUOUS

Mako focuses on her wraparound vista willing the drifting
targeting pipper to LOCK onto Invidia

EXT HAEUNDAE BEACH -- CONTINUOUS

We hear the magnetic drivers inside the barrel SPIN UP to
finally launch a kinetic round with a deafening SONIC BOOM

The supersonic bunker-buster SLAMS into one of the kaijus
mantid arms splintering the exoskeleton and leaving the
devastated limb hanging by a sinew

In a delirious rage Invidia RIPS the useless arm off and
flings it at Gipsy Danger

It falls short SMASHING into a mall

The kaiju lets out a bone-shuddering SCREAM at her attacker
before launching into a full-on charge

Raleigh watches Invidia charge slavering and savage She
seems to slow down as she draws closer

Time itself seems to be grinding to a halt The heavy rain
seems to hang in the air

Mako and Raleigh perceive to be ultra slow motion We hear
their telepathic dialogue continues --

RALEIGH (VO)

Raleigh watches the kaiju with a frozen expression

MAKO (VO)

Its my favorite Raleigh -- the
Mark 1 has a sword Isnt that just
the coolest thing

A grin of realization slowly crosses Raleighs face

EXT HAEUNDAE BEACH -- CONTINUOUS

A heavy chain-like whip SPILLS from Gipsy Dangers gauntlet
a length of razor-sharp metal segments threaded with a thick
cable The chains weight PULVERIZES the asphalt

An instant later the cable draws taut pulling the
interlocking metal segments tight together -- RATA-CHINK --
stiffening the chain-whip into a sword

It barely takes a second for the Jaeger to deploy the weapon
and in one fluid motion pull back and swing --

-- RIPPING clear through Invidias neck Her head falls off
Her monstrous body scrambles and convulses before finally
TOPPLING onto the street

INT SHATTERDOME -- DAY

Gipsy Danger stands by her docking tower The loading arms
bring the conn-pods down as a crowd of riotously APPLAUDING
PERSONNEL starts to swarm around the Jaeger

The canopy of Raleighs conn-pod opens hes on his feet
disconnecting his driveskin

He sees Makos canopy open and points to her shouting over
the jubilant noise

RALEIGH
You You can understand me You
know what Im saying

She beams and shouts back

MAKO
Yeah Can you understand me

RALEIGH
Yes

(NOTE When she speaks Makos lips move out of sync to the
words we hear -- like a dubbed movie The discrepancy
gradually ebbs as their relationship develops Eventually she
seems to be speaking naturally)

They each finish unhooking their drivesuits and vault out of
their conn-pods

The CHEERING crowd parts for them to find each other They
embrace in a enthusiastic hug Raleigh laughs from his soul
as he picks her up off the ground spinning her around

He turns to the crowd and lifts her arm up for the crowd
pointing at her

The crowd goes berserk WHISTLING CLAPPING CHEERING Mako
laughs blushes and nods a graceful thank you

INT TORABURU KARAOKE BAR -- NIGHT

Packed with SHATTERDOME PERSONNEL still in their uniforms
drinking celebrating and singing under blacklights

The whole dance floor is a giant flatscreen playing flashy

action clips from mecha anime like Gundam Mazinger
Evangelion Voltron and others

( )

We find Mako and Raleigh sitting at a booth overlooking the
action with Duc fawning over them both

DUC
We thought you guys were dead That
was amazing You can understand
each other Right now Because to
my ears shes speaking Japanese

RALEIGH
I hear it in English

DUC
(to Mako subtitled)
And you hear him in Japanese

She nods

DUC (CONTD)
What if I speak English to you

Mako looks at him with a blank look then to Raleigh

RALEIGH
He wants to know if you understand
what hes saying

MAKO
Oh No I dont

DUC
(laughing amazed)
Thats the weirdest thing Must be
like a ghost-drift but Ive never
heard of anything like it

RALEIGH
Heard of any crews who didnt speak
the same language to begin with

DUC
Fair point

Kaori comes up with a drink for her husband She sets it on
the table and bends down to whisper something in his ear He
looks up as if to say -- Really She nods

DUC (CONTD)
Hang on Youll love this

He hops up and scruffs Makos hair as he shouts to the crowd

DUC (CONTD)
First kill

The crowd cheers and Duc makes his way to the stage

( )

KAORI
You two make a cute couple

Mako turns to playfully smack Kaori who laughs and winks at
her before following her husband into the crowd

RALEIGH
What did she say

MAKO
She said -- she had to -- go down

there for some reason
They beam at each other across the table giddy and shy like

a pair of school-kids
Ducs voice spills from the sound system as he gets the mic

DUC
This one goes out to the odd couple

that saved Busan

We hear a wispy synth riff and he begins to sing --

He hands her a present She cocks an eyebrow
RALEIGH (CONTD)
Nothing huge but its the only
thing you ever said you wanted

She tears into the package -- a JapaneseEnglish dictionary
She laughs Raleigh shrugs

She looks off into space for a moment having a thought

( )

MAKO

Its really loud Im thinking
about heading back to base

INT DORMITORY HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Raleigh and Mako come down the empty hall (everyone still out
partying) Raleigh glances down at his watch

RALEIGH
Earlier than I thought

They stop just outside their respective quarters

MAKO
Im not that tired Maybe Ill
brush up on my English

RALEIGH
Yeah Ive been trying to learn
some Japanese off TV Tokyo

MAKO
Yeah Hows that going
RALEIGH
Not good
MAKO
Well Im --
RALEIGH

Right Ill just let you --
He trails off as they both turn to go into their rooms
MAKO

Hey Raleigh Sweet dreams

( )

She smiles impishly

RALEIGH
I knew it I knew it

Mako cracks up doubling over Raleigh turns beat red She
Manages to stop laughing long enough to say --

MAKO
Sorry I couldnt resist Its
cool Really I barely remember it

RALEIGH
You dont

MAKO
Who can remember a dream Do you

RALEIGH
Only vaguely

They smile at each other -- a lie agreed upon

RALEIGH (CONTD)
It happens right

She nods They both lean in their doorways Neither can think
of anything else to say but neither wants to go

MAKO
Well Goodnight Raleigh

Finally she backs into her room and starts to close her door
Raleigh does likewise

RALEIGH
Night Mako

INT MAKOS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

She shuts the door -- and hesitates with her hand on the
doorknob chewing her lip thinking

INT DORMITORY HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Mako opens her door just as Raleigh opens his

They both chuckle awkwardly as they stare at one another
across the hall a thought on the tip of their tongues
unsure of how to phrase it
Simultaneously they realize theres no point in trying to

phrase it and they let themselves collide in the middle of
the hallway kissing hungrily

Without breaking Mako backs Raleigh into his room and kicks
the door closed behind her

EXT THE ESCHATON INSTITUTE -- NIGHT

A bonfire swells spitting embers into the starry night sky
as Czerny heaps more kindling onto the blaze Flick sits
across the fire Newt stands arms crossed wary

CZERNY
The Interstice is a gateway to
another universe An older
universe A dying universe

He chuckles and gets a distant look in his eyes as he gazes
into the bonfire His smile fades

CZERNY (CONTD)
I read an article about how a
particle accelerator could create a
new universe Nonsense right
Technology far beyond us

(beat)

The Anteverse across the
Interstice is home to a
civilization eons older than Man

FLICK
Newt -- Whats he saying

CZERNY
They created our universe to
escape the death of their own And
we are merely an infestation to
them Rats on their life raft

NEWT
A while ago you told me you were
on the verge of a breakthrough
Something that could turn the tide

CZERNY
That’s why you’re here You want to
know how to stop them

FLICK
Ive got a contact at Central
Command Whatever you have Doctor
I can put it in front of the brass

He scratches his chin a baffled grin on his face
NEWT
What were you working on What did
you see in the Interstice
CZERNY

Not something in the Interstice A
way to look through the Interstice

( )

NEWT
How

CZERNY
Are you having nightmares Miss
Kincaid Worse than usual

NEWT
Were trying to ask you --

CZERNY
And I’m trying to tell you Theyre
coming from the Interstice -- the

nightmares Its broadcasting

nightmares Psychic pamphlet bombs
(whispering)

I found a way to use that signal to

see into the Anteverse

Newt stands up Hes heard enough

NEWT
This is ridiculous Psychic
signals Ivo Really

CZERNY
Midway has technology beyond your
wildest dreams We mapped the
Interstices geometry We
discovered states of matter --

NEWT
You mapped the Interstice

CZERNY
It cant be closed Newt it --

NEWT
But it has to have a weak point
right A targeted detonation --

This catches Czerny it takes him a moment to cut Newt off

CZERNY
-- would just open it wider

NEWT
I want to see the map

CZERNY
The map isnt important

NEWT
No psychic transmissions are
whats important
(shaking his head)
(MORE )

( )

NEWT (CONTD)
What happened to you You used to
be a scientist

Czerny shakes his head and sighs He stands and calmly rests
his hand on Newts shoulder with a smile

CZERNY
Im tired Newt We can talk more
tomorrow if you feel like

listening
Newt and Flick watch him shuffle up towards the main house

NEWT
Im sorry Flick I didnt know he
was this far gone

Flick watches Czerny with suspicion in her eyes

FLICK
Hes hiding something

NEWT
Maybe But what can we do

FLICK
We can find it Go see if you can
get into his study Im going to
check out that Quonset hut

INT QUONSET HUT -- CONTINUOUS

Flick steals into the darkened storage hut finding it full
of unlabeled crates

Without turning on the lights she drags one out into the
middle of the floor and strains to pry open the lid with her
bare hands -- she doesn’t know what kind of time she has

Finally getting it loose she tosses the lid aside and claws
through the packing material Finally she pulls out -- a
generic bottle of water

She looks around at all the crates and her imagination
relents letting their secrets become canned goods

About to leave she notices the corner of a doorway at the
back wall partially concealed by a stack of palettes on a
dolly She pushes the dolly away and tries the door

It’s locked With a twisted old paperclip she probes the
keyhole finessing the lock with a practiced hand

( )

Suddenly the fluorescent lights flicker on above her She

drops the

paperclip and whirls around to find Czerny

CZERNY
Now what made you think this modest
little hut had secrets

FLICK
Look I’m sorry but --
(anger flaring)
If you’d just talk Without
couching your answers in bullshit
riddles I’m so tired of running
around in circles I’m sorry

CZERNY
I’m not angry I know what it is to
be willing to chase the answers
even into the darkest abyss

FLICK
I’ve come so far to see the things
you say you’ve seen If you can’t
tell me what at least tell me how

CZERNY
There’s a telepathic area of the
kaiju’s brain Its tuned to the
signal from the Anteverse

FLICK
See This is what I mean You can’t
just expect me to believe you can
peek into a kaiju’s thoughts

CZERNY
See for yourself

He heads to the locked door and fumbles for his keys

FLICK
How

CZERNY
You know what a drift is

He clumsily unlocks the door

FLICK
The visions Jaeger pilots have when
they’re in the Pons

He opens the door

INT BACKROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Czerny turns on the lights as he leads Flick inside She
stops at the threshold daunted by the sight

Beside an examination table a 200 gallon aquarium wherein a
wrinkled coil of meat hangs in aspic-colored liquid peppered
with electrodes Big as a man it can only be kaiju’s brain

And then she notices what looks like a rough-hewn Pons on the
floor between the table and the vat

CZERNY
Well you’re about to have a drift
with a kaiju

INT MAIN HOUSE -- NIGHT

Newt moves through the darkened hallway

INT CZERNYS STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

In the dark Newt searches the rustic outback office He
turns on a flat wall monitor -- no signal So he follows an
AV cable from the monitor to a nearby cabinet

Opening the cabinet he finds a hard drive stamped with

COSDECs seal and a menacing anti-theft warning from Sci-
Division Jackpot He grins and flicks it on

The no signal message vanishes from the monitor but
nothing else comes up -- just an empty pale glow

Frustrated Newt keeps searching He looks in the closet He
opens desk drawers He crouches to look under the desk -- and
on the floor level with the top of the desk he stops

We see whats caught his attention a pair of humble reading
glasses but lined up with the glowing wall monitor we see
in the lenses shapes and colors that arent there

Newt carefully puts the reading glasses on and

THROUGH THE LENSES

clearly sees a 3D projection hanging in the air before the
glowing monitor a hidden holographic interface invisible
without the reading glasses

Finding he can manipulate the data with his hands Newt opens
folders probing deeper and deeper into Czernys database

INT BACKROOM -- NIGHT

Flick lies on the examination table Czerny tightens the
straps around her wrists and ankles

( )

FLICK
I don’t have a wetport

CZERNY
We’1ll have to do it how we did it
before the implants

He shows her the end of a data transmission cable In place
of a mundane connector the wire terminates in a three inch
gold needle a little thicker than a hypodermic needle

FLICK
Youre going to stab that into my
brain

CZERNY
Carefully

FLICK
Could this kill me

CZERNY
How badly do you want to see it

Without saying anything she rests her head on the table
Czerny secures her head neck and shoulders in a metal brace
designed to keep her skull steady for the delicate procedure

He flips on a small video screen -- on it he sees a grainy
ultrasound image of her brain He dabs a topical numbing
agent on the soft patch of skin behind her ear

CZERNY (CONTD)
I’m numbing you but it’s going to
hurt Just keep still I’m aiming
for a specific spot If I miss you
might forget the letter R or you
might become a vegetable Ready

She nods and Czerny lines up the needle He pierces the skin
and gingerly pushes the needle in She fights to contain her
reflexes as her limbs strain against the leather straps

Her face tenses with pain as he guides the needle deeper
watching its progress on the ultrasound finally finding the
targeted section of her brain The needle all the way in
He twists a dial on the makeshift Pons

CZERNY (CONTD)

I’m sending a test signal You
should smell chocolate Do you

( )

When she speaks she can’t hide her pain Her words spill out
slurred and desperate

FLICK
Yuh-yuh-yes I smell it

CZERNY
Alright Then you’re good to go
live with the specimen

He flips a switch on the Pons In the tank the disembodied
brain shivers Flick gasps She speaks oddly loud as if
trying to be heard over music only she can hear

FLICK
Voices I think I see --
something Oh god Where am I

He rests his palm on her forehead and answers her quietly
knowing she can’t hear him Her mind is elsewhere

NEWT
The other side child

And with that he departs leaving her alone on the table
INT CZERNYS STUDY -- NIGHT

Newt surfs Czernys holographic database and finally spots a
promising file intersticemodel

A 3D projection materializes before him an abstract fluid
shape resembling a funnel cloud slithering and stretching
itself randomly -- the throat of the Interstice

Newt circles the eerie projection utterly rapt carefully
examining every angle He leans close narrowing his eyes on
a point near the center Curious he tries to touch it

Suddenly the funnel shivers and breaks at its thinnest
point like an over-stretched bubble finally splitting

Not intending to collapse the projection Newt curses his
clumsiness But the implications begin to dawn on him

He brings the projection up again He touches random points
the throat ripples and flexes with his touch but he cant
seem to find the spot he touched before

INT BACKROOM -- NIGHT

In the tank the kaiju brain quivers as the web of electrodes

harvests its synapses and feeds them into the Pons where
they cross the wire stabbed into Flicks skull

( )

She lies on the table pale and shivering horrified

We transition to her vision not in one clean cut or smooth
dissolve but in a broken helter-skelter succession of
frames stuttering into an uneasy view of

THE ANTEVERSE

as Flick sees it The images have a jittery quality And the
sound drowned and THROBBING with TINNITUS clots like syrup
in our ears It feels intrinsically unstable

We find ourselves suddenly perched at a vertiginous height
Miles below us a dark and bitter alien world

The wind tosses frosty veils of hoarfrost under a blank sky --
a wide and star-less pall black as pitch

A dead sun hangs over the horizon like a bare lightbulb -- an
ashen sphere cracked by rivers of cold cruel light

An expanse of frigid ocean divided into wide sunken pens
clear to the horizon -- like an inconceivably vast fish farm
The wide sea steams with desperate breaths

Nightmarish life SEETHES in the water packed tight as
entrails Clambering talons slithering tentacles jaws
GASPING The sea steams with their ragged breaths

Kaiju All kaiju Far as the eye can see An unfathomable
mass of monstrous violence

A fine grid of walkways overlays the pens upon which we
glimpse the PRECURSORS from afar Spare skeletal figures
like the rarefied inhabitants of an architectural sketch
minuscule against the vast Darwinian chaos below them
BACK IN THE BACKROOM

Flick tenses with shivering convulsions glistening with
sweat tears trailing from her eyes

INT CZERNY’S STUDY -- SAME
Newt watches the holographic Interstice whip and flow like a
liquid sculpture He randomly stabs at it with his finger

hoping to duplicate the action that collapsed it

Suddenly the study lights come on Newt tears off the
glasses and turns

Czerny glares at him He approaches without a word and offers
his hand expectantly Newt surrenders the glasses

( )

Czerny puts them on to see what Newt had been looking at He
frowns and shakes his head as he puts the glasses in his
shirt pocket Newt interjects

NEWT
I think there’s a way to close the

Interstice If we just looked at --

CZERNY
You can’t blow up a hole

NEWT
It has a structure I touched
something I made it collapse

CZERNY
You can’t pinpoint a weak spot
It’s too fluid It’s impossible

NEWT
That’s not true What did you
tell COSDEC That closing the it
was implausible -- or impossible

CZERNY
What difference does it make

NEWT
We are fighting for our lives

CZERNY
and we will lose

NEWT
Why did they send you here

CZERNY
Because I had to be quarantined I
looked into the abyss I’d been
infected with the truth -- that
this is the end of us We are the
vermin of the gods There’s no
point in putting up a fight

He shuffles to the closet and slides the doors open

NEWT
What are you doing

CZERNY
Im finishing this

He pushes the clothes aside and pulls a chain A naked
lightbulb illuminates a warhead a Jaeger-sized munition

( )

CZERNY (CONTD)
A thermobaric warhead You know
what that is A seismic bomb For
the Mark-3 Powerful enough to blow
a category-5 kaiju in half

He huddles over a control panel wired up to the bomb Newt
strides over to pull Czerny away from the weapon

Czerny swats him away with an unexpected burst of force that
knocks Newt to the ground

He steps back The clock ticks down -- 200 159 158

NEWT
Have you lost your mind

CZERNY
Did you not listen to a word I
said They arent just coming here
They made here Their universe is
dying Its raw survival Youd
stand against the Creators of the
universe And I’m insane

Again Newt scrambles for the bomb Czerny grapples the boy

in his arms They struggle in desperation as the bomb’s clock
ticks -- 146 145 144

Their clumsy skirmish draws chaotic pirouettes SLAMMING Newt
into the wine cabinet Finally Newt catches his footing and
pins Czerny against the wall

NEWT
We can solve this There’s hope

CZERNY
Hope fails It lifts you up and it
drops you I’m not going to let you
poison the world with hope

And with that Czerny grabs a nearby letter opener and jams
the dull blade into Newt’s ribs

Newt recoils as the bloody blade CLATTERS to the floor Newt
drops to his knees in pain

Czerny throws him down wrapping his fingers around Newt’s
neck Wild-eyed he tries to wring the life out of Newt

129 128 127

( )

CZERNY (CONTD)
I’m doing you a favor You don’t
wanna be around when they get here
Ask your friend
Newt breaks Czerny’s grip and takes him by the collar

NEWT
What did you do to her

Czerny only chuckles through a blood-slick sneer Newt drops
him and takes a step towards the bomb but Czerny grabs his
ankle Newt falls to the floor and kicks his feet free

He grabs the flatscreen off the wall and drops it on Czerny’s
head The scientist falls limp

Newt clumsily gathers his bearings He glances at the bomb’s
control panel

114 113 112

Quickly he opts to find Flick and get out

EXT MAIN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Newt bursts out the door and bolts for the Quonset hut

Flick twitches on the table lost in the drift her eyes
locked on some horrid sight in some other universe

INT QUONSET HUT -- CONTINUOUS

Newt bursts inside He hears screaming and quickly spots the
back door He tries it -- locked He pounds and shouts

Shivers course through Flicks muscles Her lip quivers
Hopeless tears spill from her wide eyes

INT QUONSET HUT -- CONTINUOUS

Newt kicks at the door again and again time running out

INT BACKROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The door splinters open and Newt rushes in to find Flick
drenched in sweat and so pale almost blue He pulls the
needle out of her brain and unfastens the straps

The drift seems to linger in her mind

FLICK
So cold Cant breath

NEWT
Breathe You have to breathe

FLICK
It hurts Ice in my lungs

INT CZERNYS STUDY -- CONTINUOUS
The clock ticks -- 44 43 42
EXT THE ESCHATON INSTITUTE -- CONTINUOUS

Newt cradles Flick in his arms Her head lolls as she stares
at the sky seeing another sky some other place

FLICK
No stars The sky is dead

He briskly carries her to
THE JEEP

and straps her into the passengers seat before climbing in
twisting the ignition and throttling it so hard that

THE REAR WHEELS

spin up plumes of red dust before catching and launching the
vehicle up the road

INT JEEP -- CONTINUOUS

Newts frantic eyes dart between the twisting desert road and
the compounds gate shrinking in his rearview mirror

Flick gags Her body convulses in her seat Her back arches
as if her spine wants to break her in half She falls limp
Newt reaches over to feel her pulse as he drives

NEWT
No no no Gimme a pulse Flick

He cant stop to give her CPR He knows hes not far enough
from the blast yet He floors it Her head lolls with the
sharp turns lifeless as a doll

EXT OUTBACK ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

The jeep bobs and weaves along the tortured road We pull
back to see the escape in context -- the jeeps meandering
headlights too slow and still too close to the compound

INT CZERNYS STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

The final seconds -- 06 05 04 03

EXT THE ESCHATON INSTITUTE -- CONTINUOUS

The pavilion goes up in a mighty CRACK of light followed by a
flame-less blast and an incredible shockwave that RIPS

through every building in its path levelling the compound

It speeds out warping the air and rippling the ground

The wave SLAMS the jeep and tosses it careening end over end
INT JEEP -- CONTINUOUS

Newt steadies Flicks limply flailing body as the jeep rolls
EXT OUTBACK -- CONTINUOUS

The battered jeep finally settles on its side A moment
later Newt crawls out the sun roof He turns and pulls
Flicks body out after him

He drags her a safe distance from the wreck and checks again
for her pulse Finding nothing he begins performing CPR as
the compound burns in the distance

Cycle after cycle Compressions breaths repeat Our

hearts sink but Newt doesnt let up He doesnt shout or
lose it he just keeps at it like a machine

Suddenly Flick jolts with a fit of coughing She weakly
pushes Newt away and rolls over to puke At first it seems
such a fragile miracle he dares not touch her

She gasps and winces cradling her CPR-cracked ribs Weak
words spill out of her mouth

FLICK
Why did you save me

NEWT
What did he do to you

FLICK
I did it Newt It was my decision

She turns away from Newt coughing She holds her ribs

gingerly and succumbs to her trembling legs sitting in the
dust She watches the compound burn

( )

FLICK (CONTD)
I saw the other universe You
should have let me die Newt

Newt runs his fingers through his hair crushed to hear her
talk like this He has nothing to say

FLICK (CONT’D)

The Interstice is stabilizing More
are coming In numbers we cant
imagine

Newt has a sudden thought

NEWT
What did you say About the
Interstice

FLICK
Its stabilizing

NEWT
Are you sure How do you know

FLICK
I know because they know

Newt starts to smile He can barely get the words out

NEWT
Flick I know how to close it I
know how to close the Interstice

EXT PUDONG SHANGHAI -- NIGHT

A futuristic riverfront skyline crowded with record-smashing
supertall skyscrapers all blazing with neon color

Gipsy Danger stands in the street poised to fight an
oncoming kaiju -- as if in a neon jungle the titanic pair
dwarfed by Pudong’s orbed spires and stark glass edifices

Kaiju OOLONG a chitinous crab-like dragon with black
exoskeletal armor and giant pincers The behemoth hauls
itself up the wide freeway on the tips of its huge crab-
claws reminiscent of a knuckle-walking gorilla

Gipsy Danger lifts her arm The armor opens to expose a row

The Jaeger gathers its other hand in a fist and lands a SKULL-

Coyote Tango drives her armored fists one after the other
in an endless siege of mighty freight-train PUNCHES

He doesnt stop Not even as the PUMMELED sea turns red with

EXT MINATO MIRAI -- CONTINUOUS

Ahead of Tacit Ronin hills of water rise to spill across the
street as the kaijus bow wave heralds its approach The huge
beast hauls itself from the water onto shore

A long lizard-like creature called KOMODO Rows of teeth
curl sloppily from his jaws A baroque frill of coiled and
braided horns embellishes his head He scrabbles on six
splayed legs tail terminating in a spiked thagomizer

He is -- markedly larger than the Jaeger and (as a category-4
kaiju) the largest of any weve yet seen He shakes the water
off his scales and ROARS

Tacit Ronin stands in the shifting carnival light of the
towering Ferris wheel ready for battle

Komodo lumbers onto the street ahead of Tacit Ronin turning
to face the Jaeger

The kaiju rears up on his four hind legs brandishing his
taloned forelimbs The reptilian monster towers a full head
taller than the Jaeger

He throws his head back RETCHING and with a neck-snap
SPEWS a wad of noxious bile It SPLATTERS short of the mech

The sludge BOILS and SEETHES on the cars and pavement below
dissolving anything it touches

Tacit Ronin charges in to engage Komodo hand-to-hand Her
style is different from Gipsy Danger’s less primal and
rugged more like Bruce Lee nimble and precise

With lethal grace she assails Komodo’s scaly hide with a
storm of kicks and chops -- taekwondo on an epic scale

Her knifehand strikes cut the air like fighter jets tracing
wingtip vortices off her fingertips

She finishes the combo with a roundhouse kick a jaw-dropping
maneuver for a machine of her unparalleled size

As her feet hit the ground we hear the metallic GROAN of her
settling weight as her frame protests the unorthodox move

Tacit Ronin staggers back barely dodging his SNAPPING jaws

The monster pivots to swing his spiked tail

The Jaeger dodges the spikes on the first pass and catches
them on the second clutching the tail in an iron grip

Komodo pulls and thrashes angrily but Tacit Ronin holds
tight Finally he quivers HACKING and RETCHING

The Jaeger barely dodges the knot of acidic bile that sails
past -- to SPATTER the side of a nearby skyscraper

The glass FESTERS and DRIPS away exposing more and more of
the stacked floors inside until they can no longer hold the

A vector-straight line of searing light bores clear through

oddly bright laser-light show

With a swing of her wrist Tacit Ronin pulls the laser up

cleaving Komodo’s torso up the middle

The laser turns off The air around the array still ripples
with cosmic heat as the armor folds up to reclaim the weapon

Komodo’s balance holds his dead body up for a brief moment

He is kaiju FULCRUM -- an alien chaos of tentacles and
dinosaurian limbs his movements fluid and menacing as much
like a predator stalking primeval jungles as like a kraken
prowling sunken ruins He glisters with bioluminescence

He climbs ashore and rises to his full height -- almost a
third bigger than the Mark-2

He lashes out with one of his long tentacles The mech dodges
and as the tentacle rakes past us we see the rows of cruel
hooked claws running the length of it

It whips through the hundred meter Ferris wheel like
balsawood cleaving the neon spokes in a fit of sparks

( )

The kaiju slings his arm launching some sort of projectiles
from tubules on his wrist

The fleshy projectiles SMACK Tacit Ronins armor --
BERSERKERS delirious little tentacled creatures prying at
any seam they can find until their bodies bloat and BURST

The few stray Berserkers miss the Jaeger and fall into the
choked traffic of a nearby highway

There they enthusiastically dismember whatever they land on
RIPPING the engines out of stalled cars TEARING bystanders
limb from limb bloating and BURSTING like grenades

The Mark-2 dodges a tentacle and as it rakes past us we see
the rows of cruel hooked claws running the length of it

The tentacle cuts the hundred meter Ferris wheel like
balsawood cleaving the neon spokes in a giddy fit of sparks

With a sweep of his arm Fulcrum LASHES the Jaeger with his
longest tentacle the clawed suckers TEAR a ragged gash in
Tacit Ronins armor The mech staggers to catch her balance

Fulcrum slings another wave of Berserkers A few alight on
the mechs gashed armor RIPPING bundles of thick cables out
before swelling and BURSTING

Mid-action Tacit Ronin locks up (the Berserkers having
apparently severed some critical connection)

Frozen in this unstable posture the Jaeger tilts and starts
to fall into the side of a high-rise

The wall collapses around the paralyzed Jaeger but the rest

Jaeger seizes him by the tendrils and diverts the attacks

momentum hurling the kaiju into a high-rise

The impact JOLTS the tower off its foundation to SMASH it
against the building next door demolishing both

Fulcrum pulls himself up from the rubble shaking off the
debris -- twisted rebar splintered furniture and dead
bodies fall like dust from the colossal kaiju

Fulcrum spots the cluster of activity on the fallen Jaegers
torso and slings a batch of Berserkers towards

sloppy heaps of sickly twitching tentacles dissolve before
they can become anything remotely lethal

The towering cat-5 kaiju lashes out thrashing his tentacles

at the Jaeger in a chaotic frenzy that threatens to consume
the mech -- a dozen taloned whips cracking at once

But somehow she’s holding the hurricane of tentacles at bay
HACKING away with her chain-sword

Meanwhile her shoulder-mounted autocannon like a cannonball-
spewing Gatling gun swivels to RIP through whatever

tentacles the sword misses

Like a medieval hun she fights the thing back

Until finally it SNAGS her arm then her other

The machine struggles as Fulcrum coils what remains of his
ragged powerful tentacles around the Jaeger

We hear the GROANING of bowed metal as Fulcrum squeezes

A THROBBING PULSE of deep sound ripples the air SHUDDERS the
cars in the streets like an earthquake

Fulcrum releases Gipsy Danger shaking his head as if trying
to shake the noise out of his ears

He gestures to the projection -- the funnel-shaped internal
structure of Interstice whips and flows erratically

NEWT (CONTD)
It’s always had a chokepoint the
shape was just too fluid to ever
isolate it but --

He tweaks some dials and the motion slows down
sluggishly settling on a comfortable shape

NEWT (CONTD)
-- as the structure “solidifies”
the chokepoint slows down comes
into sharper focus

It undulates

He points out the narrow bottleneck in the throat suddenly
become plain as day Takada leans forward

TAKADA
Youre saying --

NEWT
The Interstice is more vulnerable
now than it’s ever been

He touches the chokepoint and the projection collapses

( )

TAKADA
Im guessing thats something
bigger than a standard ordinance

NEWT
Much bigger Probably nuclear

DUC
It was that easy We just chuck an
a-bomb down the chute

NEWT
Its not easy See -- time in the
Anteverse is different from ours A
year to us might be just an hour to
them So theres no objective time
within the Interstice Which rules
out any remote detonation Our
timeframe wouldnt agree with the
bombs timeframe Whatever it is
it has to be triggered on site --
by a live subjective observer

Commander Takada looks skeptical

TAKADA
If Im going to have someone riding
a bomb into the Interstice Id
like to be certain it will work

NEWT
Run my math by Sci-Division I
promise it will hold up

LETHBRIDGE
It doesnt matter There cant be a
bomb Were past peak uranium

JIAO
Hes right The mines have all but
dried up We have no single source
that could provide enough material

Raleigh speaks up from the back

RALEIGH
Yes we do The Mark-1s Thats
what we did with the last of the
uranium We used it to power the
first Jaegers Like Gipsy Danger

INT CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

At the end of the hall Raleigh and Mako face one another
holding hands Raleigh speaks Mako nods we dont hear the
conversation Were with Pentecost and Takada watching

PENTECOST
You cant order them to do this
Theyve both lost so much They
were broken when I got them --
broken and scattered into the wind
I didnt even think it was
possible but by god they are
putting themselves back together
You cannot make them to do this

TAKADA
You think I want to We have here a
chance to end this

PENTECOST
We may be indulging an artificial
sense of urgency here What if it
is just a random spike in attacks

TAKADA
Its not

PENTECOST
We don’t know who this Kincaid
woman is How do we know the
Anteverse she saw is real

TAKADA
It is I was the project CO at
Midway when Czerny found a way to
see through it

PENTECOST
I heard you tell the Secretariat
Czerny’s work was nonsense

TAKADA
It’s not I saw it Stacker I saw
it myself And I shut him down
Because I knew the things he could
show us would break our will
They are coming for us

PENTECOST
It didn’t break you sir

TAKADA

Im a fighter Stacker I don’t
know how to be anything else

( )

Down the hall Raleigh and Mako cling together as they exit

PENTECOST
You cant order them to do this

TAKADA
I wont order them But as the
only active Mark-1 crew they know
theyre first on the list And I
wont stop them if they accept

Quiet empty The two Jaegers standing in the moonlight

On top of Gipsy Danger we find Raleigh and Mako lying side

by side

about the future Not since Osaka
It always seemed like I died there

wanted you to show me the Big Sur

Oh the leaves Theyre so red I

cant even tell you

MAKO
Just weeks ago I wouldnt have
cared to leave it all behind

MAKO
It has to be someone who loves the
world enough to want to be in it I
cant make someone else --

She turns to face Raleigh tears in her eyes

I think it does have to be us
What do you think

Raleigh dwells on it

looking up at the crescent moon and universe of

live there are gonna rise up and
slam the door on your ass

He turns and smiles she smiles back -- an accord

TIME LAPSE The night passes over the two Jaegers The sky
brightens Technicians and equipment dart about the floor
The sun pours light into the now bustling launch bay

Amidst the hustling Techs preparing the Jaeger we meet Newt
on the floor standing in front of Gipsy Danger with
schematics in his hands Tendo looks over his shoulder

NEWT
You bypassed all the safeties It
needs to go prompt critical

TENDO
Trust me Shes a bomb

NEWT
(on the schematics)
Whats this

TENDO
The crew wanted to cross their
eject switches

NEWT
His ejects hers vice versa

Tendo nods A human detail it brings it home for Newt

NEWT (CONT’D)

INT CHANGEROOM -- DAY
Mako pulls on her drivesuit and turns for Raleigh to zip her
up He plants a kiss on the nape of her neck before slowly
pulling the zipper up No kaiju no rush
RALEIGH
Do you think wed have happened if
wed met any other way

MAKO
I dont actually

Raleigh pulls the torso of his drivesuit up to thread his
arms through the sleeves Mako zips him up

MAKO (CONT’D)
Not every miracle happens --

RALEIGH
-- A lot of em have to be built

He turns They face each other For a long moment neither
says anything -- just quiet bittersweet smiles

RALEIGH (CONTD)

INT SHATTERDOME -- DAY

Everyone on the floor watches as Raleigh and Mako cross
towards Gypsy Danger helmets tucked under their arms

They spot their sister crew Duc and Kaori watching from the
mezzanine level They salute one another

FLICK
Raleigh

He turns and sees her running across the floor He nods at
Mako and she gives them some space But now that Flick has
his attention she doesnt know what to say

RALEIGH
When you asked me if you hadnt
gotten with Yance --

FLICK
You dont have to --

RALEIGH
I did all I could It just wasnt
enough I hated that it wasnt
enough What I said at the bar --

She nods Shes had it all sorted out

FLICK
Is this -- Are we saying goodbye
RALEIGH
The plan is to eject at the last
second
FLICK

So youre coming back
He cant look her in the eye Finally an uncertain frown

FLICK (CONTD)
It doesnt have to be you

RALEIGH
It has to be someone

( )

She hugs him holding tight -- the goodbye she never got to
give his brother

FLICK
You give em hell Raleigh You show
em what were made of

They let go and Raleigh walks the home stretch to join Mako
and Pentecost at the pods Pentecost keeps his emotions
bottled in with last minute formalities

PENTECOST
Youll have a live map on your HUD
Itll take a moment for the core to
go critical so youll be prompted
to trigger it just before the
chokepoint Thatll give you about
a second to eject

RALEIGH
Tendo crossed the pods

PENTECOST
Just like you asked

He grips their shoulders in either hand and looks between
the two of them Theres really nothing to say

They both nod He pats them and steps back as they climb into
their conn-pods

By now everyone has stopped what they were doing Across the
floor all eyes fall on Mako and Raleigh

As the loading arms raise the conn-pods Mako and Raleigh
look down from their open canopies

Everyone on the floor stands at silent attention Pentecost
shouts and they all salute at once

Raleigh and Mako savor the poignant moment for as long as
they can bear Then they buckle their helmets and shut the
canopies -- Its game time

long sinuous necks erupting from a body like a naked bat

vicious mandibles and long horns like a rhino beetle

A gap not in the ocean floor but in space just above the

coronal plasma we see Gipsy Danger drifting ever down
towards the opening small as a moat of dust

Kaiju Pharaoh slams into Tacit Ronin but the Jaeger manages
to hold her ground Monsoonal sheets of rain slash the
combatants Lightning CRACKS the sky

Pharaoh bears down with slavering mandibles Tacit Ronin
strains to hold him at bay

Buildings collapse as their struggle careens through Odaiba
as Tengu and Scunner slowly converge on the sloppy fray

Finally Tacit Ronin gets the advantage long enough to throw
Pharaoh back The Jaeger deploys her continuous-wave laser

She lights the beam and sweeps it to slice Pharaoh right
across the middle A moment of stillness

Pharaohs torso slides off his legs along the neat diagonal
cut The halved kaiju THUNDERS to the ground dead

Behind the body the tops of the high-rises slip loose
revealing the same hairline vector that cleaved the kaiju --
the laser had cut through the beast to the skyline behind it

neck It falls away -- and two additional Kaiju hurtle up
from the depths to pile into the free-falling Jaeger

EXT ODAIBA -- DAY

Tacit Ronin throws a punch at kaiju Scunner

Scunner catches the strike in his mighty claws and squeezes
The Jaeger strains against him but Scunner is too strong

leaving a stump of frayed cables and twisted metal

her coolant reservoirs

The vapor clears leaving Tengus frosted husk Tacit Ronin
starts to turn back to Scunner

The remaining kaiju pulls and the hardened foam starts to
crack Finally it BREAKS off from the ground

With most of the tumor of rock still encasing his arm he
swings it like a club and SMASHES it against Tacit Ronins
torso a devastating blow that shatters the hardened foam

Tacit Ronin teeters and falls on her back

Scunner climbs atop the fallen Jaeger and lifts his fists
high into the air

Like a crazed chimp he SLAMS his long arms down

raising the creatures body over her head

The wind and rain lash her A flash of lightning A CRACK of
thunder For a moment she holds the hulk of flesh

We hear her frame GROANING under the beasts weight but
before it can give way she throws the monster

reassuring hand on her shoulder
Suddenly the Officer stands up

Sir Ive got something Its one

of the pods
EXT PACIFIC OCEAN -- CONTINUOUS
Near the ships a conn-pod breaches in a fit of salt spray
It rolls and finally settles The canopy opens Thick steam
bleeds from the open pod We cant see who it is

As the vapor quickly dissipate we find Raleigh inside He
quickly unhooks himself and climbs out onto the pod

He shades his eyes and scans the horizon He spots the rescue
ships and keeps searching

He sees no sign of the second conn-pod

We slowly pull back across the water back from the drifting
pod and the ships behind it It seems final

Suddenly in the foreground the second conn-pod heaves up
through the surface and settles to bob on the water

Raleigh plunges into the water and swims for the second pod

He climbs on as the canopy opens spilling plumes of steam
into the clear ocean air He tries to claw the steam away

Finally he sees Mako tucked down in her cockpit unbuckling
her harness and yanking the cables from her drivesuit

She looks up and sees him They laugh giddily wiping tears
from their eyes She reaches up and lets him pull her out

They linger atop the floating pod holding tight to one
another not daring to let go

We pull back letting the blue ocean unfurl under us The
ships slowly approach the embracing pair They never let go
