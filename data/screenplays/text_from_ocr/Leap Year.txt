EXT LOUISBERG SQUARE - DAY

It’s a sunny crisp winter day in this upscale Boston
neighborhood We see a SIGN out in front of one of the
TOWNHOUSES OPEN HOUSE TODAY 11-2

INT TOWNHOUSE - DAY

ANNA (30s) poised and driven stands in the vacant
apartment She looks around It’s dark The carpets are
worn Dusty curtains hang in the windows Anna takes it
in for a moment -- and then gets to work (BEGIN TITLES
SEQUENCE )

- Anna DIRECTS a TEAM OF MOVERS as they carry in
BEAUTIFUL ANTIQUE FURNITURE NEW RUGS CURTAINS and ART

- ANNA shows them EXACTLY where to put the furniture She
arranges BEAUTIFULLY BOUND BOOKS on the shelves Puts
FRESH FLOWERS in vases Hangs classy BLACK and WHITE
PHOTOGRAPHS Even puts a MOZART PIANO CD on the stereo

- The REALTOR walks in and looks amazed The place has
been completely transformed It looks BRIGHT AIRY and
BEAUTIFUL Anna hands the Realtor a package of SLICE AND
BAKE COOKIES

ANNA
Put these in the oven a half hour before
the open house and you’1l have multiple
offers by lunch

Anna’s BLACKBERRY BUZZES and she’s out the door

- Speeding along in a CAB Anna types into her
Blackberry She pulls up to her next appointment

- A DOWNTOWN LOFT We see quick cuts of Anna as she
transforms it from a cold industrial space to a cool
modern apartment Puts a MILES DAVIS CD on Gives this
REALTOR the frozen cookies Checks her BLACKBERRY

- Anna pulls up in a cab to a SMALL STUDIO APARTMENT
When she gets there the place looks tiny and cramped
When she’s done it looks CHARMING AND SPACIOUS She puts
a hipster FRANCOISE HARDY REMIX CD on Hands yet another
realtor the cookies

REALTOR
Thanks You know I sold that Back Bay two-
bedroom on the first day To the first
couple who walked in Boy I got lucky on
that one
ANNA
Luck didn’t sell that place a new sofa
and a vase of dahlias did I don’t
believe in luck You make your own luck

REALTOR
All I know is you’re worth every penny

Anna’s BLACKBERRY BUZZES again We see the next
appointment CO-OP BOARD - 3 PM

ANNA
Oh I have to get over to The Waterford
REALTOR
Youre staging an apartment at The
Waterford
ANNA

No I may be buying one
The Realtor looks very impressed
EXT THE WATERFORD - DAY

A beautiful PREWAR APARTMENT BUILDING Anna meets her
BOYFRIEND JEREMY (30s enthusiastic and intelligent)
out front They KISS

As they break apart Anna straightens his tie

ANNA
You didn’t wear your lab coat Co-op
boards love a doctor

JEREMY
This is The Waterford they think doctors
are blue collar

She laughs Jeremy takes out his iphone
JEREMY (CONTD)
Wait I want a picture of you under the

awning

ANNA
Jer I don’t want to be late

JEREMY
Say “three bedroom overlooking the
Common”

She smiles and he snaps the photo He looks at it
ANNA
How do I look Chic yet respectable

JEREMY
Beautiful Look at this image quality I
just downloaded the new HD Camera app --
youre even more adorable in high def
Who wouldn’t want this woman living in
their building

She can’t help but be charmed by his enthusiasm They
stride to the entrance where a UNIFORMED DOORMAN holds
the door open Jeremy holds his hand out for her to enter
first A gentleman

INT THE WATERFORD - DAY

A beautifully-furnished apartment with sky-high ceilings
and gleaming parquet floors Anna and Jeremy sit across
from two OLDER WELL-GROOMED WOMEN and one SILVER-HAIRED
MAN in a bow tie This is the CO-OP BOARD And they are
finishing up

WOMAN 1
Well Thank you both again for coming in
We have to review some things internally
of course

MAN
But that was an outstanding interview
You do seem like just the type of people
who should be calling The Waterford home
And not just because half of us are old
enough to need a good cardiologist in the
building Dr Silver

They all laugh Anna looks at Jeremy proud

WOMAN 3
(less enthused)
Mmm
(looking through her notes)
I don’t believe there’s anything we’ve
missed unless there’s something you’d
like to add

Anna and Jeremy exchange a look Then Anna leans forward
very direct

ANNA
All right look There’s really no other
way to say this other than being
completely blunt We don’t settle
(MORE )
ANNA (CONTD)
Jeremy and I we just aren’t those types
of people And what we want you to know
is if you do choose to let us move in
here we will continue not to settle We
will be the best tenants the most
devoted to the building --more than
anyone else because we don’t know any
other way to be

Jeremy nods It’s true

ANNA (CONTD)
As you know I’ve staged apartments all
over this area for sellers even a few
next door at The Wesley

You can tell by the look on the board members’ faces that
they feel less-than enthusiastic about The Wesley And
Anna was expecting that reaction

ANNA (CONTD)
I’ve seen everything and if I may state
the obvious there is no building in
Boston finer than The Waterford So how
could we possibly settle -- literally --
anyplace else

The Man and Woman 1 seem to agree Anna looks at WOMAN
3 who seems to be the least swayed by this speech

ANNA (CONTD)
I just love your vitrine Beidermeier
Louis XIV

WOMAN 3
Fifteenth
ANNA
Of course I should know that Well it’s
exquisite
WOMAN 3
Thank you

She finally smiles pleased to have her “exquisite” taste
recognized

EXT THE WATERFORD - DAY

Anna and Jeremy celebrate out on the sidewalk
JEREMY
Well that couldn’t have gone any better
And you You were amazing That thing
with the cabinet

ANNA
I knew it was Louis XV but I sensed she
was one of those “smartest person in the
room”-types

He gives her a big kiss

JEREMY
We might live at The Waterford

ANNA
I know It’d be a good present
wouldn’t it For maybe the fourth
anniversary of our first date Our
date-a-versary

He tickles her

JEREMY
You are the worst hint-dropper ever Do
you really think Id forget Four years
is big

She giggles in his arms

JEREMY (CONTD)
I made a reservation at L’Espalier And I
may have even gotten you a special
present

ANNA
Really What is it Tell me

JEREMY
No no no you know I like surprises You
have to wait Tonight eight o’clock

ANNA
Eight o’clock

She shudders chilled in the February air

JEREMY
Always freezing what is it with you

He hits the alarm on his new CLS BWOOP

JEREMY (CONTD)
Here take my sweatshirt
He wraps it around her gives her a kiss

ANNA
What would I do without you

JEREMY
Buy more layers See you at eight

ANNA
Ill be there

Anna wraps the sweatshirt around her She can’t stop
smiling as Jeremy drives off down the street

INT CHIC NAILS - DAY
Korean nail salon Anna and her sister LIBBY (40
suburban mom) sit in huge spa chairs getting manipedis

The KOREAN WOMAN on Libby’s nails finishes filing

KOREAN WOMAN 1
You no want polish

LIBBY
No polish My kids ruin it in ten
minutes
(to Anna)

Don’t forget we have dad’s birthday
tomorrow He wants to eat at that bar

She an Anna both make the same disgusted face Anna
inspects her hand The left one specifically Leans in
to the Woman doing her nails

ANNA
I’m sorry but can you just re-file this
one one more time It’s uneven

LIBBY
All right that’s getting obsessive even
for you

Anna shrugs A smile creeps onto her face

ANNA

It’s just I need that hand to be perfect
even bigger smile)

For my engagement ring

LIBBY

Your what

ANNA
I think it’s happening tonight
LIBBY
No

Anna nods Uses her free hand to pull a BUSINESS CARD out
of her bag Hands it to Libby

LIBBY (CONT’D)
Beacon Hill Estate Jewelry Where’d you
find that

ANNA
In his sweatshirt pocket

LIBBY
No

Anna nods again

ANNA
And he’s taking me to L’Espalier tonight
for our anniversary And he said “four
years is big” He said that

LIBBY
I wish Ronny had bought my ring at Beacon
Hill Jeremy has such good taste

ANNA
It probably helped that I tore out the
magazine ad and left it on his desk a
month ago The one with the bracelet

LIBBY
Love that bracelet Good move

Libby hands the card back

LIBBY (CONTD)
Ugh you must be so relieved

ANNA
Thank you

LIBBY
You know what I mean

ANNA
Fine obviously there was a tiny part of
me that was getting concerned I mean
wed talked about it but it was “well
well get to it eventually” and then it
was just off the table for a while and IL
wasn’t gonna be the one to put it back
on

(MORE)
ANNA (CONTD)

(to her nail woman)
Could you use extra lotion on my
cuticles Thanks

(back to Libby)
I mean I love my life with Jeremy but
what -- now we’re buying real estate
together and we’re not engaged Hellew
-can you say “skipped a step”

LIBBY
Well none of that matters now

ANNA
Nope

Libby’s suddenly very excited for her sister

LIBBY
I can’t believe you’re getting engaged
(to the Korean woman)
She’s getting engaged

ANNA
I’m getting engaged

The woman smiles and nods It’s not clear if she
understands

INT ANNA and JEREMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The place is beautifully decorated Right out of Dwell
magazine Nothing out of place ANNA AND JEREMY ENTER
Jeremy’s tie is undone He’s carrying a TO-GO BOX

JEREMY
Was your duck okay You didn’t really eat
much of it

Jeremy takes off his coat Anna is right behind him She
nods

JEREMY (CONTD)
You could have sent it back My steak was
amazing

Anna looks at the BRAND NEW BRACELET on her WRIST And
then at the BRACELET SIZED JEWELRY BOX from BEACON HILL
ESTATE JEWELRY

JEREMY (CONTD)
What time is it ten-thirty Ugh I gotta
be at the airport at seven

(MORE )
JEREMY (CONTD)
I have to call and confirm my car finish
some charts pack get the Slingbox set
up -- I gotta say I love the fact that
I’1l be all the way in Ireland and I
won’t miss a single Celtics game That
was the best present ever sweetie

He goes off into the bedroom Anna stands there looking
at the bracelet and the box She THUMPS her head against
the wall How could she have been so stupid

INT ANNA and JEREMY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Jeremy is packing some suits into a garment bag

JEREMY

Make sure to tell your dad happy birthday
from me Can’t wait to hear what ship’s
finally coming in for him this time

(zipping up the bag)
This conference should be interesting
The Swiss are unveiling this new MRI Who
knows maybe we can convince the hospital
to pony up and buy one

INT ANNA and JEREMY’S HALLWAY - NIGHT

Anna is in the hallway not really listening She’s
looking at FRAMED PHOTOS on the wall Anna and Jeremy
enjoying ski trips birthday dinners a Paris vacation
Valentine’s day FOUR YEARS OF HER LIFE She looks
down at the bracelet again depressed

JEREMY (0S)
You can always come with me you know

Jeremy passes by disappearing into the guest room to
grab something else

JEREMY (0S) (CONTD)
Who doesn’t want to visit Ireland in the
dead of winter
(bad Irish accent)
I hope you like your potatoes frozen

He laughs as he crosses back to the bedroom He stops
coming back out to look at Anna

JEREMY (CONTD)
Anna You okay You look upset

Anna turns to him She doesn’t know what to say

JEREMY (CONTD)
You’re nervous about the co-op aren’t
you

Anna nods covering Jeremy walks over to her Wraps his
arms around her

JEREMY (CONTD)
I know I hate to be going away when all
this is going down but there’s really not
much to do after the interview I’m sure
they’1l let us know by the weekend

Anna nods

JEREMY (CONTD)
Come on We’re gonna get it When do I
not get you what you want

He gives her a little squeeze and heads back into the
bedroom Anna glances down at the bracelet again

EXT THE POUR HOUSE - DAY

A classic Boston watering hole The perfect spot for a
liquid lunch

INT THE POUR HOUSE - DAY

Anna sits with Libby in one of the old school booths
where names have been carved into the wood over the past
decades Across from them is their FATHER JIM (60s) in
a sportjacket with no tie A WAITRESS picks up his EMPTY
DRINK and replaces it with a refill

JIM
Thank you m’lady Look at those eyes
You look like a young Connie Selleca

Anna rolls her eyes as the waitress smiles politely and
walks away

ANNA
Seriously she could be Libbys daughter

LIBBY
Hey I’m not that much older than you
She could be your daughter

JIM
Oh lighten up you two Can your dear old
dad help it if he falls in love too easy
He toasts

The girls
a big dad
revealing

ANNA
I don’t know but does he have to do it
every place we go

JIM
How did I raise such a romantic The
world is ripe and fragrant with
possibility Banana Breathe it in

to it Anna does not She changes the subject

ANNA
Do you want to open your present

JIM
Absolutely

push a wrapped box across the table Jim makes
show of shaking it -- and then unwraps it --
a brand new BLACKBERRY

JIM (CONTD)
Well look at that It’s a phone

ANNA
No no -- it’s a BlackBerry You can put
all your appointments and contacts in
there -- you can even send email

He looks at it Already knowing he’s never going to use

it Libby

knew this was a bad idea

LIBBY
Or you can just use the phone part

ANNA
No Use the whole thing It’s perfect
You know how youre always writing stuff
down on scraps of paper or matchbooks and
then they’re all stuffed in your pockets
or worse you just lose them now you
can just type everything in there

JIM
Well that’s great girls As soon as I
get a spare moment I’1ll crack open the
instructions and figure out what all
these buttons do

No he wont He sets the box down and quickly changes the

subject

JIM (CONTD)
So how’s that Jeremy How are things
going in the medical trade Hey did he
ever call that guy I met who was starting
that boxing gym It’s a great investment
he should put some money in that

ANNA
Yeah I mentioned it

She grits her teeth and reaches for her water Jim
notices her sparkly new bracelet

JIM
Whoa what are you trying to do blind
me Lemme put my sunglasses on Where’d
that come from

ANNA
Jeremy got it for me for our anniversary

JIM
What still no ring What’s with that
guy What’s there to decide

ANNA
(defensive)
Not everyone proposes marriage to the
person who brings their drink all right
There are people in this world who
actually take their time to think about
these kinds of things

JIM

Youre gonna have to pull a Grandma Jane
ANNA

A what
JIM

Jeremy’s already in Ireland right Half
the battle’s over

(off their confused looks)
I told you this story Grandma Jane
always used to joke that Papa Tom took so
long to propose that she almost dragged
him to Ireland

LIBBY
What’s in Ireland

JIM
In Leap Year there the women can propose
to the men

(MORE )
JIM (CONTD)
On the 29th -- it’s a tradition I think
if she’d had enough scratch for the plane
tickets she woulda done it too But Papa
Tom finally stepped up on his own and
here we are

He chuckles and takes a drink Swallows

JIM (CONTD)
Whaddaya say Banana Should we send you
to Ireland to get down on one knee

ANNA
I -- no

JIM
I can pay for your ticket Some of your
ticket Actually if you wanna do it right
now you should probably pay for it and
Ill pay you back

ANNA
That’s okay

JIM
I’m serious I’ve got something coming
down the pike in a couple of months
that’s really going to set me up nicely
I can’t say much about it right now but
let’s just say it’s 99 percent a done
deal already It might involve vacation
homes -- not time shares per se -- but a
very lucrative opportunity You know
what I’ve said too much already But
I’ve got a good feeling about this

Anna and Libby have heard this before

ANNA
Dad I’m not going to Ireland I --
appreciate the advice but I don’t think
that’s for me

Libby tries to diffuse the building tension

LIBBY
We should order some lunch

JIM
Good idea Order me a club sandwich eh
Libs I gotta hit the head

He gets up and leaves for the men’s room Anna looks at
her sister

LIBBY
I know I’m sorry It is a gorgeous
bracelet Don’t be mad

ANNA
He seriously thinks I should go to
Ireland and propose to my boyfriend He
lives on a different planet

Libby holds out a comforting hand to Anna Anna takes it
GROANS then slumps her head onto the table spent Then

ANNA (CONTD)
And this table is sticky

We DISSOLVE TO
INT ANNA and JEREMY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Anna in that same position head on her pillow She’s
having a hard time falling asleep There’s a PHOTO of HER
AND JEREMY smiling happily just staring at her from her
bedside table She rolls over shutting it out And her
eyes land on her wrist -- the BRACELET A symbol of her
disappointment Exasperated she flips onto her back
puts the pillow over her head Then after a beat she
finally throws the blankets aside and gets out of bed

INT ANNA and JEREMY’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Anna opens her laptop Does a GOOGLE SEARCH Quickly
finds a bunch of articles on LEAP YEAR PROPOSALS IN
IRELAND She reads looking at PHOTOS of WOMEN PROPOSING
ON ONE KNEE IN DUBLIN

ANNA
(reading)
“Ladies Privilege” “Dates back to the
fifth century” C’mon this is real

She reads on Finds more PHOTOS IRISH WOMEN KISSING
THEIR MEN -- SHOWING OFF THEIR RINGS Anna looks tempted
for a second But quickly shakes her head at the
absurdity and SNAPS THE LAPTOP SHUT She gets up and
walks away

After a few beats Anna sits back down and opens up the
laptop again This time she finds a VIDEO CLIP on YOU
TUBE

VIDEO IN FRONT OF A OLD CHURCH IN DUBLIN A CUTE IRISH
WOMAN GETS DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND EMOTIONALLY PROPOSES TO
HER WORKING CLASS BOYFRIEND

HE TEARFULLY ACCEPTS AND GIVES HER A PASSIONATE KISS THE
CROWD AROUND THEM CHEERS

Anna watches getting a little emotional too

ANNA (CONTD)
Awww

But again she thinks better of it and SNAPS THE LAPTOP
SHUT She gets up

But quickly she sits back down and OPENS THE LAPTOP
again This time she goes right to the AER LINGUS site
Clicks on SEARCH FOR FLIGHTS

EXT LOGAN AIRPORT - DAY

Libby is dropping Anna off at the INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL
Anna takes her designer luggage out of the trunk

ANNA
Okay Tickets passport --
(scrolls down her BlackBerry)
Hotel address -- Is this crazy Tell me
this is a terrible idea and I won’t go

LIBBY
I thought you already left Jeremy a
message to tell him you’re coming

ANNA

(already moved on)
It’s just last night I just couldn’t
think of another way to make this happen
I mean if he didn’t propose on our
anniversary then when Christmas That’s
the next major holiday Which is a year
from now I don’t want to have to freeze

my eggs

LIBBY
What

ANNA
It’s true If I wait much longer I could
be trying to get pregnant at 40 Remember
cousin Jackie Three years of fertility
treatments She had to take those pills
that made her a complete whack job --

LIBBY
She got twins
ANNA
And I was thrilled for her But twins
won’t work for me I need to do one at a
time so I can keep my job plus Jeremy
wants us to be able to travel -- I mean
suddenly we’re four people on an
airplane I’ve seen you guys struggle
through security

LIBBY
It’s not pretty

ANNA
I want one to be verbal and out of
diapers before I have the second so
that’s a three-year wait right there The
point is -- I have to make this happen
now

LIBBY
Well if anyone can make this happen it’s
you It’s what you do you stage things
And youre gonna have a great story it’s
so romantic --

ANNA
And Jeremy loves surprises --

LIBBY
Trust me you are coming back engaged

Anna goes to pick up her bags Looks at Libby

ANNA
Can’t leave this things to chance right

LIBBY

PRESENTATION of medical slides and technical data Jeremy
ducks out to the back of the room

JEREMY

(INTERCUT)

ANNA
How about “hey I can’t believe you’re

JEREMY

ANNA
I don’t know I finished that condo I was
staging and I saw this long weekend ahead
of me and who am I to turn down a free
trip to Dublin

JEREMY
Well it’s a nice surprise

Anna smiles to herself pleased This is a good sign
ANNA
Oh they’re telling me I have to turn off

Anna hangs up and fastens her seat belt Slips on her
neck pillow Her headphones Pops her sleeping pill
Closes her eyes and smiles We hear the ROAR OF JET
ENGINES
EXT HIGH ABOVE THE ATLANTIC - TWILIGHT
The 747 soars eastward toward the darkening horizon

INT NIGHT

Anna is awakened by TURBULENCE WHUMP She turns still
groggy -- her headphones slide awkwardly over one eye

ANNA
What’s going on
The PASSENGER next to her points out his window Anna
looks out to see the THICK CLOUD LAYER FLASHING WITH
LIGHTNING WHUMP A few passengers GASP

PILOT (0S)

(over intercom)
Ladies and Gentleman as you can tell
weve encountered some bumps due to
thunderstorms over the Dublin area
Unfortunately due to the unexpected
severity of the weather the Dublin
airport has been shut down until further
notice We will be diverting to Cardiff
in Wales where our representatives will
do our best to get you to your final
destinations as soon as possible

As the passengers all GROAN the plane BANKS and TURNS
Anna still looks disoriented

ANNA
Wales Is that far That’s next to
England right

The passenger next to her just nods Yup

INT CARDIFF INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - WALES - MORNING

The place is a zoo full of tired and angry passengers
all trying to get to their actual destinations

We find Anna in front of the Aer Lingus desk throngs of

other impatient travellers behind her

ANNA
There are no flights until tomorrow

AER LINGUS REP
(tired Welsh accent)
Until we are given any information on
when the Dublin airport will re-open the
earliest flight I can put you on is
standby for the two o’clock tomorrow

ANNA
Two That’s not going to work What
about the morning

AER LINGUS REP

youll get to Dublin by tomorrow night

ANNA
No no -- no Look I have appointments

proposing to my boyfriend on the 29th
Leap Day It’s an old Irish tradition
So I don’t think you understand the
gravity of the situation I have a window
here and I’m not gonna let some stupid
storm at some rinky-dink airport close
that window

AER LINGUS REP
(glances at her screen)
- Annnd it looks like the two o’clock

ANNA
So there’s no other way to get to Dublin
before tomorrow night is that what
you’re telling me

AER LINGUS REP
There’s a ferry out of Swansea to Cork --

Anna runs off

ANNA
Ferry out of Swansea ferry out of
Swansea

She spots an OLDER AIRPORT GUIDE by the information
booth

ANNA (CONTD)
How do I get to Swansea

EXT WELSH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
BUS TRAIN and TRAIN MONTAGE

A miserable-looking Anna rides through Wales on a BUS
She rides though Wales on a TRAIN She gets off that
train and barely makes it to a DIFFERENT TRAIN It’s
still RAINING ON AND OFF And all the while she’s TRYING
UNSUCCESSFULLY TO GET RECEPTION on her BlackBerry And
it’s getting dark by the time she makes it to

EXT SWANSEA FERRY DOCK - EVENING

The SWANSEA FERRY STATION She is tired and lugs her bags
up to the lone AGENT at the TICKET COUNTER

ANNA
Is this the ferry to Cork And is that
where I catch the train to Dublin

FERRY TICKET AGENT
Yes it is Ma’am But perhaps you’1ll want
to wait until the mornin’ Looks like it
might start blowin’ pretty hard out
there

She leans over the counter almost threatening

ANNA
No thank you

He nods Of course

EXT SWANSEA FERRY - NIGHT

The STORM is raging again The BOAT is being TOSSED
AROUND in HUGE SWELLS SEAWATER CRASHES over the sides

We find ANNA HANGING ON to a rail for dear life Trying
to stay dry and not lose her lunch This is miserable

EXT IRISH PORT - NIGHT

The storm has let up slightly as the FERRY finally chugs
into port

EXT SWANSEA FERRY - NIGHT

Anna looking much the worse for wear drags her bags up
to the exit platform The Captain -- looking a little
pale himself -- helps her off

ANNA
Cork train station

CAPTAIN
Cork You’re not in Cork luv

ANNA
What Why not

CAPTAIN
Did you not see that storm We had to
divert You’re lucky to be alive

Anna can’t believe this

ANNA
Then -- where the hell am I

CAPTAIN
Dingle

ANNA
Dingle Well how do I get to Dublin from
here

He shrugs Looks up It has started to SNOW

CAPTAIN
How about that I don’t think it’s snowed
here in thirty years I’m gonna need you
to get off the boat now

He escorts her off the walkway on to the dock The snow
starts to fall a little heavier The Captain pulls the
WALKWAY back to the boat Anna looks around and sees a
small cluster of LIGHTS in the distance A town

EXT DINGLE - NIGHT

Snow continues to fall on the lone MUDDY ROAD makes up
the main street of this tiny village town Anna drags her
bags behind her They are now covered in MUD She’s not
looking too good herself All the shop fronts look dark
except for one little TAVERN with the light on

The sign above the door is broken It looks like it reads
ARAGH’S The windows are filthy But she doesn’t really
have much choice

INT ARAGH’S TAVERN - NIGHT

Anna enters It would be kind to call the place dingy
It’s empty except for two ANCIENT IRISHMEN at the bar
mid argument It looks like they never leave their bar
stools They are JOE and SEAMUS

SEAMUS
Youre a fluthered arse is what you are

JOE
And youre an idiot

They drink

SEAMUS
Keats isn’t even Irish

JOE
We’re not talking about “greatest Irish
poet” You said “greatest love poet”
And I say Keats is better than Yeats

SEAMUS
Aaargh
ANNA
Um excuse me But -- does anyone know

how I can get to Dublin from here
They glance at Anna And then look back at their drinks

JOE
Hmph Someone got lost on her way to the
Blarney Stone

SEAMUS
Or the Guinness factory

They CACKLE and LAUGH Anna stands there

ANNA
Is there a train maybe To Dublin

SEAMUS
(to Joe)
Why would a young American woman come all
the way out here on her own

JOE
She sounds Australian to me The way she
said train Tray-een

SEAMUS
She’s not Australian

ANNA
Hello I’m right here Yes My name’s
Anna and I am from America Boston
actually And I’m trying to --

SEAMUS
Wine comes in at the mouth
And love comes in at the eye
I lift the glass to my mouth
I look at you and I sigh
-- Yeats Bloody brilliant

JOE

That’s not about love it’s about
drinkin’ ya scuttered plonker

(recites)
Pillows upon my fair loves ripening
breast
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest
That’s a real love poem By a real poet --

SEAMUS
Ah you just like it cause he’s talkin’
about breasts

JOE
Damn right Just ‘cause the last pair of
tits you saw was your mother’s

SEAMUS
The last pair of tits I saw was your
mother’s

They exchange “Arrrghs” and drink

ANNA
Uh I see you’re having an important
discussion but I really do need to find
a way to get to--

DECLAN (0S)
Dublin We heard you the first time

Anna turns startled at the gruff voice And emerging
from the shadows at the end of the bar comes the
BARTENDER A BEARDED SCRUFFY GLOWERING BRUTE of a man
in his mid-thirties He almost growls at Anna as he wipes
out a dirty pint glass This is DECLAN

DECLAN (CONTD)

Let me tell you something Anna from
Boston I’ve been to Dublin And it’s a
city for blaggards and cheats and
backstabbing snakes It’s where the worst
kind of slime and sewage and shite runs
off of this great country and collects in
pools and they needed to give it a name
so they called it Dublin

He SPITS on the floor and goes back to cleaning his
glass Anna nods Oh-kay

ANNA
Is there anyplace else open around here
tonight
JOE
The bus I’d take the bus
ANNA
(relieved)

There’s a bus
Anna just

She holds

JOE
The bus to Kilarney Then the train to
Cork

ANNA
Cork Right I know I can get there from
Cork --

SEAMUS
Cork Why would you send her to Cork She
should take the train to Limerick and
then the bus to Kildare

JOE
Kildare Then she won’t even see the Ring
of Kerry

SEAMUS
She didn’t ask to see the Ring of Kerry
you gobshite

wants an answer

ANNA

Is there any way just to drive Like hire
a taxi or a car right now and just go
Look I changed my money at the airport --
god knows I had time --

(digs through her purse)
And I’ve got seven hundred Euro to
whoever can drive me straight to Dublin
tonight

up the wad of cash The old men stare at it

This must be a lot of money to them It even grabs
Declan’s attention

JOE
I’m thinkin’ you might find somebody for
seven hundred Euro

SEAMUS
(this is rare)
No argument from me

Anna smiles Now she’s getting somewhere

SEAMUS (CONTD)
Excepting you can’t leave It’s Friday
It’s bad luck to start a journey on a
Friday

JOE
Or start a new business You don’t want
to start a business either on a Friday

SEAMUS
Does she look like she’s startin’ a
business

JOE

You also shouldn’t move into a house on a
Friday Or cut a new dress for that

matter

SEAMUS
You can’t cut a dress on a Tuesday you
idiot

ANNA

Seven hundred Euro to anyone with a car

DECLAN
Nobody’s taking you anywhere right now

Anna turns back to Declan He’s putting an end to this

DECLAN (CONTD)
It’s the middle of the night No one’s
crawling out of their beds just ‘cause
you decided you need to get to Dublin
You’re just gonna have to wait till
morning to throw your money at someone

Anna looks at the old men but they don’t disagree

ANNA
Well -- what am I supposed to do until
then

Declan doesn’t respond That’s your problem

JOE
She can stay here

DECLAN
I don’t have room

JOE
Declan Brady you got a floor full of
vacant rooms up there and you’re gonna
throw this lass out into the street

ANNA
I’m fine -- I’ll find a hotel

SEAMUS
That’s not Las Vegas out there darlin’
this is the hotel

DECLAN
One night That’s it

ANNA
(under her breath)
I imagine that’ll be plenty

Anna picks up her bags

JOE
She looks hungry Maybe shed like a
little something to eat

SEAMUS
Crispy duck

The men look quite excited by this Anna could be
interested Declan glares

DECLAN
The kitchen’s closed

He grabs a ROOM KEY off a hook and heads upstairs Anna
follows

INT TINY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Declan throws open the door The room looks like it
hasn’t been slept in a while The frilly Irish lace
bedspread looks ancient There are cobwebs in the
corners Anna looks less than thrilled

DECLAN
The loo is down the hall

ANNA
Are there towels in --

He slams the door shut before she can finish Anna looks
around the poorly lit room Tries to keep it together
Exhausted she sits down on the bed -- kicking up a CLOUD
OF DUST from the sheets Wonderful

INT ARAGH’S - NIGHT

Anna is in the TINY guest room Her SUITCASE IS OPEN ON
THE BED She opens the CLOSET to try and hang up a few
items Only she can’t open the closet because it opens
right into the bed

She attempts to squeeze a dress into the little space but
she can’t even do that Then she sees ANOTHER CLOSET DOOR
on the other side of the bed

Arms full of clothes she shimmies her way along the
narrow space to get to the other side But the second
closet is PACKED with hotel supplies -- a few BROOMS tip
out and hit her on the arm as two large BOXES of
CHOCOLATE MINTS crash to the floor Along with a lone
PHOTOGRAPH DECLAN WITH HIS ARM AROUND A PRETTY BLONDE
Anna glances at it for a moment --

But her BlackBerry chirps She picks it up THERE’S
ACTUALLY A SIGNAL Finally some good news But the
BATTERY is blinking LOW Anna quickly rifles through her
bag and pulls out a European ADAPTER and her POWER CORD
Looks around for an outlet Finally finds one behind a
tiny TABLE

After a hurried struggle and maneuvering and MOVING of
the table she’s able to plug in the adapter and at last
her Blackberry and -- PZZZZT The adapter sparks and her
Blackberry fries before her eyes Anna gasps like she’s
been stabbed in the heart

INT ARAGH’S - PUB - NIGHT

From upstairs we hear Anna’s BLOODCURDLING SCREAM
Declan Seamus and Joe look up at the ceiling perplexed
None of them move to get up

JOE
Why don’t you just take her to Dublin
You rather give Peter Begley that seven

hundred

DECLAN
Yeah ‘cause he’s a taxi service and I
aren’t

SEAMUS

He’s a ginger bastard is what he is

JOE
How many past due notices are you
expectin’ to get from the bank It was a
loan not a bloody gift

We hear the CLANGING of PIPES as Anna turns on the
SHOWER

DECLAN
Maybe if you two piss artists would pay
for your own drinks once in a while

SEAMUS
Oh I see So we’re the problem It’s got
nothing to do with you gambling the money
away in card games --

JOE
Or dog racing

SEAMUS
Or which leaf’s gonna fall off the
Hawthorne tree

DECLAN
I had a good tip on that Hawthorne leaf

JOE
I’m serious Deckie It’s been a year
you may wanna take your head out your ass
and run a business again You never cook
nothin’ --

SEAMUS
We’re your only customers most nights --

DECLAN
This place is fine Whyn’t you mind your
own business then I’m grand

SEAMUS

(to Joe)
If bullshit was music he’d be a bleedin’
brass band

(to Declan)
Youre not grand you’re shite And this
place is shite Moping around here all
day and night with that ridiculous
beard

At the mention of his father Declan looks at the floor

JOE
The bank’s gonna take this place at the
end of the month and you don’t seem to
care Your Da built this place from
nothing and you’re about to piss it all
away

SEAMUS
Or go ahead and live on the street Don’t
matter to me I can drink anywhere

INT ARAGH’S - ANNA’S ROOM - NIGHT

Anna has finally removed her wet clothes and is about to
grab something out of her suitcase to put on when --

BANG The door opens

DECLAN
All right I’1l drive you

Anna shrieks and drops down between the bed and the wall

ANNA
Do you not knock

DECLAN
Why do I gotta knock it’s my house

ANNA
Because I’m a guest -- I’m not even
dressed

Declan sees the fallen boxes of mints and the photo
still on the floor

DECLAN
What’re you doing with those

ANNA
They fell on me

DECLAN
Why were you looking in there anyway

He quickly grabs the stuff off the floor shoves the
photo in his pocket and the mints back in the closet

ANNA
Could you please turn around

Already annoyed Declan makes a big show of turning
around to give her some privacy

DECLAN
There Better

ANNA
Not really no

DECLAN
Were leaving first thing Seven AM

Anna manages to slip into a large t-shirt from her bag
ANNA
The sooner the better

DECLAN
And I want all seven hundred Euro In
advance

ANNA
No way You get it when we get there
How do I know you’re not gonna rip me
off

DECLAN
Lady if I want your money I’1l sneak in

ANNA
Thank you Ill sleep so much better
knowing that You will get it when we get

DECLAN
Fine Deal

ANNA
And I need to use your phone Your outlet

She holds up her dead Blackberry

DECLAN
You got a phone card

ANNA
No

DECLAN
Phone’s five a minute

Anna shakes her head as she pulls on her jeans

INT ARAGH’S - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Declan’s PHONE is on the counter There’s a lot of fine
cooking supplies in here all with a fine layer of DUST

over them

Anna calls Jeremy Declan stands next to her looking at
the clock the entire time

ANNA
Oh my god Jeremy it was a nightmare

INT THE SHELBOURNE HOTEL - DUBLIN - SAME

Jeremy is in bed A large luxurious bed with expensive
linens He’s playing with his iphone

JEREMY
I can’t believe it that’s an outrage
I’1l have my office call the airline and
get you comped for the ticket Save all
your receipts

INTERCUT

ANNA
They already offered me a free ticket
Like I’m ever coming to Ireland again
And I ruined my suede bag Destroyed

JEREMY
(sympathetic)
Honey
ANNA
I know

She’s pouty Declan makes a face clearly disgusted

JEREMY
It’s probably too late now to get a
car Okay I’m going to skip my morning

seminar and come out there and get you

ANNA
No honey don’t do that I’d feel guilty
if you missed anything important I got
this --

She looks at Declan who is eating from a jar of olives
and mopping the liquid off his chin with his shirt

ANNA (CONTD)
person here to take me We’re leaving
first thing in the morning

Declan SPITS an OLIVE PIT across the room at a large
trash bin Score

ANNA (CONTD)
(disgusted)
First thing

JEREMY
Okay baby I love you

ANNA
I love you too

Declan spits another pit Two in a row

JEREMY
Gotta tell ya I’m seriously disappointed
with Dublin Two whole days and I haven’t
seen a single leprechaun

She tries to laugh but she’s yawning

JEREMY (CONTD)
Listen to you get some sleep you must
be exhausted

ANNA
I am

They say their GOODBYES and hang up Declan spits a third
pit PING It hits the top of bin and ricochets back --
landing in Anna’s hair She freezes thoroughly
appalled Shakes her head the tiniest bit Plop The pit
falls to the floor

With a shudder she stalks out of the room Declan calls
after her

DECLAN
That’s twenty Euro

ANNA (0S)
Put it on my bill

We hear her stomp back upstairs
EXT DINGLE - MORNING

The sun is coming up over the town
INT ARAGH’S - MORNING

Anna comes through the bar with her suitcase She’s ready
to go She stops and looks around for a minute The
morning light is coming through the dusty windows and you
can see that this place has remnants of charm -- they’ve
been sorely neglected but they’re there

She stops in front of an old framed photograph of a
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN standing in front of Aragh’s
holding a BABY The place looks pristine and she smiles
proud She’s lovely The SIGN hanging above her reads
CARAGH’S

EXT ARAGH’S - MORNING

Anna steps out into the sun Now that she can see the
streets the homes Dingle actually looks picturesque

The snow is mostly melted The homes are painted in
bright cheery colors with window boxes full of flowers
A group of CHILDREN come running down the street
laughing A MAN rolls by on a bicycle RINGS his little
bell and NODS in Anna’s direction A WOMAN passes smiles
at her

WOMAN
Good morning

Anna doesn’t say anything She seems stunned by the
gregariousness She quickly calls after the woman

ANNA
Good morning

The woman turns and smiles Gives Anna a little wave

Anna notices a tiny ANTIQUE SHOP across the street She
crosses to look in the window

EXT ANTIQUE SHOP - MORNING

Anna presses her nose up to the window Tea sets silver
service porcelain figures In a tiny JEWEL BOX a
CLADDAGH RING And just beyond that a ceramic PLATE
hand painted with the inscription Giorraionn Beirt
Béthar -- Two Shorten The Road

Anna smiles she finds this sweet perhaps charming

BANG A car BACKFIRES behind her and she jumps Turns to
see

Declan rolling up to the front of Aragh’s in a car that
looks about fifty years old Because it is A rusty
sputtering Wolseley Hornet Declan HONKS the horn Anna
looks at the car horrified

Declan looks at her and honks again clearly annoyed
Anna crosses over to the car

ANNA
I’m hoping that’s the car that’s gonna
take us around the corner to the car
were actually driving in

Declan gets out of the car and slams the door Picks up
Anna’s bags and brutally tosses them in the back She
cringes

ANNA (CONTD)
Those are TAnthony

He looks at her blankly for a beat

ANNA (CONTD)
They’re very expensive
(no response)
Seriously there’s no way this heap is
gonna make it to Dublin

JOE (0OS)
That’s a Wolseley Hornet She’s a
workhorse

Anna turns Joe and Seamus are headed up to Aragh’s

JOE (CONTD)
Car’s been alive longer than you Miss

ANNA
That’s what concerns me

SEAMUS
You goin’ through Limerick Declan

JOE
I told you she don’t want to miss the
Ring Of Kerry

SEAMUS
What do you work for the visitor’s
board What’s so great about the damn
Ring Of Kerry

JOE
It’s beautiful Was good enough for
Charlie Chaplin --

SEAMUS
Look at her She don’t even know who
Charlie Chaplin is

JOE
Argh

SEAMUS
Arrghh

They’re done with each other

ANNA
While I actually do know who Charlie
Chaplin is I’d just like to go whichever
way’s the fastest Preferably in a --
nice safe vehicle

JOE
She’s plenty safe look at that

He slams his hand on the ALL METAL DASHBOARD

JOE (CONTD)
That’s all steel right there

Anna grimaces

ANNA
Yeah none of those fancy airbags to get
in your way

Declan barks

DECLAN
Would you get in already Thought you
were in some big hurry

ANNA
I am

He gets back in the car Anna shores up her courage and
heads for the passenger side

ANNA (CONTD)
Well Nice meeting you --

SEAMUS
HOLD IT

Anna turns startled Seamus points at a STRAY CAT that’s
wandered up to the car

SEAMUS (CONT’D)
You can’t go now Cat S’bad luck

ANNA
I’m sorry

Seamus is very serious about this
SEAMUS

It’s bad luck to start a journey if you
see a cat

JOE
I think it’s a magpie

SEAMUS
It’s a bleedin’ cat you dim bastard

Anna’s had enough

ANNA
You know what I’1l be just fine To be
honest I don’t even believe in luck I
think you make your own --

JOE
You don’t believe in luck

SEAMUS
That’s daft What else don’t you believe
in Gravity

JOE
The moon

Anna’s not about to get into it with these guys

ANNA
Well as I said nice meeting you

She gets in the car Joe and Seamus are coming up with
more absurd examples Declan turns the engine over The
car rumbles and rattles Anna definitely looks uneasy
She reaches for her seatbelt holds up only a LAP BELT

ANNA (CONTD)
There’s no shoulder part

Declan reaches over grabs it and roughly buckles her in
YANKS it tight She’s too shocked to say anything Joe
leans over for a final goodbye
JOE

Safe travels lass Go n-éiri an bothar

leat May the road rise up to meet you
That was sweet Anna smiles Then we CUT TO
EXT ROAD - MORNING
The bumpiest road in Ireland Maybe in the world
Anna is being jostled about the Hornet like she’s on

horseback She looks a little green Looks over at
Declan he doesn’t seem to mind this at all

He’s listening to some loud local punk band on the radio
and EATING Some extremely messy SANDWICH Eggs are
involved And some kind of meat A particularly sloppy
bite spills onto his shirt He scoops it up with his free
hand and SLURPS it into his mouth

Anna exhales disgusted She goes to open her window but
it won’t roll down The handle turns and turns but
nothing happens

ANNA
My window doesn’t work

No response Anna tries to remain cheery
ANNA (CONTD)
Well this is good It’s only a few
hours right Maybe I can get some Dublin
shopping in before the stores close

Declan’s response is a satisfied BELCH Gross

DECLAN
That’s why you’re going to Dublin To
shop

ANNA

No I’m going there to-- Can you turn the
radio down please It’s really loud

Declan rolls his eyes Reaches over and snaps it off

ANNA (CONTD)
Thank you I’m going there to propose to
my boyfriend On the 29th You know for
Leap Year

She starts to get excited

ANNA (CONT’D)
We just had our four year anniversary and
he’s there on business He’s a
cardiologist There’s a big international
medical conference in Dublin

Declan doesn’t seem to care She continues

ANNA (CONTD)
I actually thought he was going to
propose a few days ago but he didn’t and
well were about to buy this co-op
together so surprise He has no idea
that’s why I’m coming but I am I’m
doin’ it

(MORE )

ANNA (CONTD)
(can’t believe it herself)
Whoo

She giggles giddy

ANNA (CONT’D)
Crazy

There’s a beat of silence Then --
DECLAN
That’s the fucking stupidest thing I’ve

ever heard

Anna looks shocked

ANNA
I -- no it isn’t
DECLAN
Yeah it is
ANNA

No it’s romantic It’s a tradition An
extremely romantic tradition

DECLAN
An extremely stupid tradition

ANNA
Stop saying that

DECLAN
It’s just a fact Squid It’s a day for
sad desperate women to trap themselves a
man who clearly doesn’t want to get
married

Anna gasps deeply offended

DECLAN (CONTD)
Youve gotta know if your man wanted to
propose to you he’d have done it already

ANNA
You know nothing about me or-- my man

DECLAN
No Well here’s what I do know It’s all
as useless as tits on a bull You can be
engaged or married or just having a shag
but in the end you’ll always end up
alone Somebody’s gonna get left That’s
the cold hard truth

(MORE )

DECLAN (CONTD)
You’re born alone and you die alone and
that’s the way life goes End of story

Anna is fuming

He laughs

ANNA
End of your story You know who winds up
alone Rude burpy people like you who
could never attract a woman let alone
keep her Look at you

which just makes her angrier

DECLAN
Look at me Look at you Spoiled whiny--
(imitates her)
“Maybe Ill get some shopping in”--
Swannin’ around with your fancy hairdo
and your money and your ‘very expensive’
luggage So American

ANNA
Oh so you hate Americans

DECLAN
Everyone hates Americans Squid The
Americans just aren’t paying attention

ANNA
You know what It’s bad enough that you--
no No Forget it I will not stoop to
your level We’re done We’re done
talking I’m not paying you to talk I’m
paying you to drive So just drive

DECLAN
You got it Squid

ANNA
And why do you keep calling me Squid

Declan zips his lip No talking Anna is about to respond
but she stops herself Just glares at him then turns and
looks out the window

EXT ROAD - DAY

CLOSE ON A BLEATING SHEEP standing in the middle of the
road WIDER to reveal MORE SHEEP at least thirty
milling around the center of the road The Hornet rolls

to a stop

ANNA
Whose sheep are those

Declan doesn’t answer

ANNA (CONTD)
Whose sheep are those Why aren’t they --
(realizing)
You can talk now Whose sheep are those
Shouldn’t there be someone with them
Like a dog Or a farmer

He shrugs

ANNA (CONTD)
Well are they going to move

He shrugs again

ANNA (CONTD)
Seriously

He says nothing Frustrated Anna leans over and HONKS
the horn Declan swats her hand away

DECLAN
Get off my horn

ANNA
Well it’s not like youre doing anything

DECLAN
I am doing something I’m waiting for the
sheep to move

ANNA
But they’re not moving We don’t even
know how long they’ve been there

DECLAN
They’re sheep not tombstones They won’t
grow moss You got two days before your
big proposal Squid I’m sure they’1l move
before then

ANNA
Okay what does that mean “Squid”
DECLAN
It’s slang for “quid” You know money
cash
ANNA

You’re calling me cash

Declan looks at her She is isn’t she
ANNA (CONTD)

My name is Anna thank you

She looks back at the sheep impatient

ANNA (CONTD)

So you’re not going to do anything

DECLAN

What is it you’d like me to do

ANNA
I don’t know move them

DECLAN
Move ‘em yourself Squid

Anna boils Unbelievable

ANNA
All right Fine

She gets out of the car and slams the door

EXT ROAD - SAME

Anna stands by the sheep not wanting to get too close

They’re bigger than one would think and they look kind

of grimy

ANNA
Okay out of the road

She CLAPS her hands together

ANNA (CONT’D)
Move along now go on
(thinks)
Ha sheep HA
(beat)
HA

Declan watches from inside the Hornet amused

Outside Anna’s getting impatient

ANNA (CONTD)
Move I said MOVE

A few sheep turn and head back to her

ANNA (CONTD)

No no The other way Get away

she stumbles back

She whimpers Tries to retreat but is now mid-flock She
reaches out considers PUSHING one of them but thinks
better of it Instead she LIFTS HER FOOT Gives one of
them a gentle SHOVE with her shoe

It works It starts to move Anna’s pleased

ANNA (CONTD)
Ha

She goes to repeat the motion but LOSES A SHOE in the
MUCK of the road

ANNA (CONTD)
My shoe

She balances on one foot tries to look down for her
shoe but MORE SHEEP have wandered up and crowded the
space around her legs

Declan watches her balancing on one leg panicking He
snorts Until she FALLS out of his sight lost amidst
the sheep

He quickly jumps out of the car LEAVING THE ENGINE
RUNNING

Declan runs into the road running at and immediately
commanding the sheep

DECLAN
HAH HAH

HE SWATS A COUPLE of them as they pick up his pace and
run off the road down the EMBANKMENT on the other side

He turns back to see Anna scowling from the road as she
wrestles her shoe out of the muck He jogs up and offers
her his hand She ignores it struggling to her feet on
her own

ANNA
I wouldn’t be down there if you’d just
helped me to begin with

DECLAN
You wouldn’t be down there if you’d just
waited for the sheep to cross

Anna scoops a handful of mud out of her shoe Behind
them we see the Hornet beginning a SLOW ROLL BACKWARDS

ANNA
Well These are ruined

DECLAN
Just wash ‘em out

ANNA
They’re six hundred dollar Lanvin ballet
flats You can’t just wash them

DECLAN
Your shoes cost six hundred dollars
(looks at her one good shoe)
They look like my Gram’s house slippers

And it’s picking up speed

ANNA
Well they’re not They’re --

Anna sees the car And SCREAMS Declan turns His eyes
widen He runs after the car

ANNA (CONTD)
Get it Get it

She runs after him on one shoe Declan reaches for the
hood of the car can’t catch it

ANNA (CONTD)
Oh my god no no no

The car slides backward off the side of the road down
the embankment and into a TREE CRASH Anna screams
Declan turns and gives her a little wave

DECLAN
It’s fine Fine

EXT ROAD - DAY

Anna stands at the edge of the road looking in both
directions for someone anyone to come and pick her up
Behind her we see a sweaty red-faced Declan PUSHING the
Hornet up over the edge of the hill He finally gets it
back up on the road and stands there panting

DECLAN
Fine

Anna says nothing Just shakes her head Declan catches
his breath

EXT ROAD - DAY

Declan and Anna are back in the car

ANNA
If I still had a phone we could call
someone

Declan waves her off confident

DECLAN
Ah you and your phone Your phone didn’t
lift this car outta the ditch Your phone
didn’t push it up the hill And your
phone won’t get it running again Takes a
man to do that

He nods proudly Anna looks less than confident But he
turns the key

And the engine rattles to life Declan looks nearly as
surprised as Anna She looks at him whoa He holds his
hands up see He smiles and shifts into gear

And the car dies Just dies
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Anna gets out of the car furious She slams the door
behind her She stops around the back of the little car
and PULLS HER LUGGAGE OUT Declan gets out of the car

DECLAN
I’m gonna have to charge you extra to get
this towed Plus repairs

ANNA
Are you kidding I’m not giving you
another dime you left the brake off

She digs into her bag and pulls out a few BILLS Shoves
them at Declan

ANNA (CONTD)
Here Forty Euro Thanks for taking me --
what was it Two miles There you go

She turns and starts walking back up the road

DECLAN
Where are you going

ANNA
I’m gonna take my chances with the train
to the bus to the friggin’ train

DECLAN
I wouldn’t go walking around on your own
Squid Never know who might be out here

ANNA
I’1ll be great as long as it’s not you
And my name is ANNA

She keeps walking
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY - LATER

Anna is dragging her luggage behind her as she keeps
walking She already looks tired

About twenty feet behind her is Declan He watches as her
rolling bag gets stuck in a little ditch and she
struggles to pull it out

DECLAN
That looks heavy

Anna turns around glares She yanks her bag free and
keeps walking A few moments later she hears him
talking

DECLAN (0S) (CONTD)
Hey mate Look I’m gonna be headed back
earlier that I thought Uh huh Yeah--

Anna turns around surprised Sees Declan talking with
his hand to his ear He has a PHONE

But Declan smiles and hold his hand up It’s empty He
was just teasing He laughs derisively Fuming Anna
walks to the OTHER SIDE of the road

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - LATER

Anna stops There’s a FORK IN THE ROAD She’s not sure
which way to go Declan is still behind her across the
road

DECLAN
Hmmm Now the question is was she paying
attention when they drove past here
Which way is it The right The left

She looks at him Looks back at the two roads

DECLAN (CONTD)
What’s a squid to do

She doesn’t know And that’s when she spots an OLD FARMER
with a white beard PLOWING A FIELD JUST AHEAD past the
dead end She WAVES and CALLS OUT TO HIM

ANNA
Hey Hello

He doesn’t turn so she walks out into the field to get
his attention

ANNA (CONTD)
Excuse me Hello

Declan watches curious
EXT FARM FIELD - DAY

Anna runs through the field trying to wave down the
farmer

ANNA
Hello

She runs right up to him CROSSING RIGHT PAST HIS HORSE
He stops the horse

ANNA (CONTD)
Hi I’m sorry to bother you but do you
know how I can --

And the OLD FARMER just starts YELLING AT HER IN GAELIC

Anna looks startled She has no idea what he’s saying
But she did something to really piss him off

ANNA (CONTD)
Uh I’m sorry I -- do you speak
English

He is still yelling at her POINTING TO HIS HORSE and
SHAKING HIS FIST AT ANNA

ANNA (CONTD)
I’m sorry I don’t know what I did

DECLAN
You crossed the path of his horse

She turns to see Declan walking up to her and the farmer
DECLAN (CONTD)

It’s bad luck to cross the path of a
man’s plowhorse

Anna stares at him

ANNA
Youre kidding right

Declan gestures to the furious farmer He’s not kidding
The farmer is still glaring at Anna -- grumbling under
his breath

ANNA (CONTD)
Of course How could I have been so
stupid I crossed in front of his horse
I’ve cursed his land for all eternity
trying to keep it together)
Fine You know what Could you tell him
I’m really really sorry
beat)
And ask him if he has a phone I could
use

Declan SPEAKS TO THE FARMER IN GAELIC The farmer
answers

DECLAN
to Anna)
He doesn’t have a phone And he won’t
accept your apology He says you don’t
seem sincere

Anna narrows her eyes at Declan He shrugs

ANNA
Could you assure him that I am
(pleading eyes at farmer)
- very sincere and then ask him if he
knows how to get from here to Dublin

DECLAN
How is that different from asking me

ANNA
Just ask him --

The Farmer perks up

OLD FARMER
Dublin

They turn He asks Declan a QUESTION IN GAELIC Declan
turns back to Anna

DECLAN
(to Anna)
He wants to know why you want to go to
Dublin

Anna looks at the Farmer Tries to muster a sweet smile

ANNA
Go ahead Tell him

Declan tells the farmer in GAELIC The farmer looks at
Anna And BURSTS OUT LAUGHING Declan laughs too

ANNA (CONTD)
Right Thanks

The farmer points at her and says something demeaning and
laughs some more Declan is very happy to join right in

Anna sighs fed up -- when she sees a BROWN VAN
approaching the fork in the road She quickly WAVES at
the VAN and RUNS BACK TO THE ROAD

ANNA (CONTD)
HEY HEY

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Anna FLAGS DOWN THE VAN It rolls to a stop Backs up a
bit

ANNA
Hey Thank you Thanks for stopping

The DRIVER of the van is a decent looking guy in his late
twenties He’s wearing an Irish football jersey that
reads COBH RAMBLERS

ANNA (CONTD)
I’m trying to get to Dublin --

VAN DRIVER
Dublin You’re a long way from Dublin
luv

ANNA

I know Is there any chance you’re headed
towards a train station or a bus
station

VAN DRIVER
Train station’s up ahead a few miles

VAN DRIVER
Well mind you I can’t stop I’m gonna
need you to jump out as I drive past

ANNA
Oh I’m not sure I can --

VAN DRIVER
Ahh hop in Of course I can make a stop
What kind of person would I be if I
couldn’t afford a stranger a little
kindness

Anna is very relieved The driver helps her up

DECLAN (0S)
(serious)
I wouldn’t get in that van if I were you

ANNA
(to van driver)
There’s your answer

Declan has walked up to the van

DECLAN
I’m not joking

ANNA
Really What’s the problem Is it bad
luck to get into a brown van on a

Saturday

DECLAN
No That bloke’s a Ramblers fan He can’t
be trusted

Declan points to the driver’s jersey Anna rolls her
eyes She gets in the van The driver scoffs at Declan

VAN DRIVER
What are you a Cork City fan And here I
thought that smell was comin’ from the

horse

DECLAN
City rules Ramblers suck the dog’s
bollocks

Anna slams the door shut

VAN DRIVER
Aye after your ma’s done with ‘em

He laughs and pulls away Declan flips them off

He watches the van putter away Declan stands there Now
he’s on his own The farmer shakes his head and pats his
horse

EXT BROWN VAN - DAY

The driver chats with at Anna as he drives Very
friendly

VAN DRIVER
Dublin eh It’s a beautiful city Best
restaurants in the country And great
nightlife too

ANNA
Yeah Well that’s good to hear I think
I’ve been misinformed by someone not
quite as sophisticated Thanks again for
taking me to the train

The driver nods Anna sits back in her seat happy to be
on her way The driver LAUGHS remembering

VAN DRIVER
Last time I was in Dubin me and my mates
got langered I mean positively mangled

Anna smiles and nods Okay

VAN DRIVER (CONTD)
Remember that boys When we got so
locked in Dublin we gawked all over the
bloody street

He’s looking in the REAR VIEW MIRROR Anna turns around
very surprised to find TWO LARGE GUYS in the darkened
windowless back of the CARGO VAN

ANNA
Oh I didn’t realize anyone was back
there Hi

The guys just stare at her They don’t look nearly as
nice as the driver They also have on RAMBLERS SHIRTS
but one has his FACE PAINTED and is MISSING A FEW TEETH
The other has a SHAVED HEAD and a NASTY NECK TATTOO They
are real soccer HOOLIGANS They are both DRINKING from
WHISKEY BOTTLES

VAN DRIVER
These are my mates Ned and Happy

Anna nods Manages a tight smile

ANNA
Happy Right Mom was a big fan of Snow
White

HAPPY

What’d you say about my Ma
Oh shit She quickly turns back to the driver

VAN DRIVER
We’re on our way to a match Gettin’
millied up to kick some hoolie arse

They all let out a whoop of a BATTLE CRY Then burst into
a ROWDY MENACING FOOTBALL CHANT

HOOLIGANS (TOGETHER)
We hate Shamrock Rovers We hate Dundalk
too -- THEYRE SHITE We hate Cork City
but Ramblers we love you Oi Oi Oi Oi

It ends with a scary FASCIST SALUTE Anna’s getting a
little freaked out

ANNA
Are we uh -- almost there

VAN DRIVER
Ah what’s your hurry lassie Don’t be
in such a rush We’re a good time We
could have a nice little party the four
of us

This is getting uncomfortable The hooligans have inched
closer to the front They stare at Anna

ANNA
Yyyeah You know it’s such a nice day
out I think I might rather walk

VAN DRIVER
C’mon lassie We ain’t gonna bite
Especially not Ned he ain’t got enough
teeth

They laugh This is getting ugly The driver PULLS THE
VAN OFF THE MAIN ROAD Slows to a stop

ANNA
I can get out here That’s -- that’s
great

VAN DRIVER

Wait Slow down We can chill here for a
few minutes We’1ll have a few laughs
Maybe a quick snog

ANNA
Okay Great meeting you guys I’m gonna
get going now --

Anna scrambles to UNLOCK the door and reaches for the
handle But THE DRIVER STOPS HER Pulls her away from the
door

There is real fear in Anna’s eyes -- but suddenly the
DRIVER GETS PULLED RIGHT OUT HIS DOOR He is PUNCHED HARD
ACROSS THE JAW BY DECLAN

Anna is very relieved to see him But before she can say
anything the HOOLIGANS come CHARGING OUT OF THE VAN

HOOLIGANS
or

MUSIC UP The FIGHT is on
EXT DUSTY ROAD - DAY

Ned and Happy TACKLE Declan pulling him off the driver
Then they start KICKING HIM

VAN DRIVER
You should mind your own business
mucker

The OLD FARMER climbs out of his RUSTY LITTLE PICKUP and
YELLS at the Hooligans in Gaelic Ned scoffs

NED
Aw look He brought Father Christmas
with him

Anna’s still in the van

ANNA
He had a truck

Declan TWISTS NED’S LEG causing him to drop in pain

DECLAN
Crawl back to your bog you tosser

Declan hops up but HAPPY GRABS HIM and SLAMS HIM INTO THE
SIDE OF THE VAN Oof Anna yelps She scrambles out of
the van

The driver approaches the old farmer

VAN DRIVER
You a hardcase whitey

The farmer pulls out a PITCHFORK Warns him to back off
The driver laughs He QUICKLY GRABS THE PITCHFORK RIGHT
OUT OF HIS HANDS BREAKS THE HANDLE OVER HIS KNEE Uh oh

Meanwhile Declan spins Happy around and PUNCHES HIM IN
THE GUT Drops him with an UPPERCUT He turns to see The
driver about to swing at the old farmer

But before he can get there Anna races over and SWINGS
HER SUITCASE at the driver’s head She connects

VAN DRIVER (CONTD)
AAARGH

The driver turns around to Anna really pissed

VAN DRIVER (CONTD)
Oh I wasn’t done with you

He raises his hand to hit her and Anna winces but
Declan is already there Declan WHACKS him in the back of
the head with the broken pitchfork handle The driver
DROPS

Anna looks at Declan incredibly grateful

ANNA
Oh my god Thank you so much
(to the Farmer)
Both of you

The farmer glares at Anna Yells at her in Gaelic again
Anna doesn’t know what she did wrong this time

DECLAN
He says you owe him a new pitchfork

EXT DUSTY ROAD - DAY

The farmer’s rusty pickup drives away leaving the beaten
hooligans in the dust Declan and Anna sit on the front
bench seat with the farmer Declan wipes some blood from
his lip Anna is pale still very much in shock

ANNA
Oh my god that was -- Thank god you
followed me

Her eyes well up and she quickly wipes a tear away
Declan can’t help but notice He looks uncomfortable

DECLAN
I didn’t show up for you I just couldn’t
pass up a chance to kick some Rambler
arse

He shifts unsure of what else to do
EXT IRISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The TRUCK drives along the winding road past miles of
lush green rolling hills

EXT CAHIRCIVEEN STATION - DAY

The truck has stopped at a TINY RAILWAY STATION in the

middle of the countryside It’s a simple rural station
just a raised platform and shelter -- and not much else
to see

EXT CAHIRCIVEEN STATION - DAY

The TICKET BOOTH Inside there’s an OLD STATION MASTER
He looks like he could have worked here fifty years ago
And he probably did There’s a little sign on the window
that reads FRANK REILLY STATION MASTER

ANNA
Hi I’d like to get on the next train to
Dublin
Frank nods
FRANK

Twenty-seven Euro

Anna hands him the cash Declan watches her HANDS
They’re TREMBLING

FRANK (CONTD)
The next train departs in -- two hours
and forty three minutes

ANNA
Thank you

She walks away and sits on a nearby bench Declan remains
at the kiosk Anna wraps her arms around herself cold

DECLAN
When’s Killarney

FRANK
Just missed it Next is eighteen hundred

Declan walks over to the bench and after brief
consideration sits beside Anna Perhaps he’d like to say
something kind something comforting but what comes out
instead is

DECLAN
Ballycarbery

ANNA
What

DECLAN

Ballycarbery Castle Up there

He points On a not-too-distant hillside a CASTLE The
only other building around for miles

DECLAN (CONTD)
Do you want to go see it

ANNA
Um no thanks

DECLAN
You sure It’s grand And the view

He whistles

DECLAN (CONT’D)

It’s not like you’re ever gonna be out
this way again You should see a real
Irish castle I’ll take you up

Anna realizes he’s finally trying to be nice

ANNA
I uh I don’t want to miss my train

DECLAN
It’s a twenty minute walk you’ve got
near three hours

Anna looks at the castle tries to resist

ANNA
I don’t know what about my bags

EXT CAHIRCAVEEN STATION - DAY

Frank is now standing by his office with Anna’s bags
She still looks worried

ANNA
You’re sure I won’t miss the train

FRANK
Ma’am one of the privileges of being the
station master is that no train leaves
this station til I says so
(re the castle)
Ballycarbery’s grand You should see it

DECLAN
It is grand

ANNA
Okay

She looks at her watch again and then at Declan
EXT LUSH HILLSIDE - DAY

Anna and Declan hike up the beautiful hillside The sun
is shining and the air is clear Anna takes a deep
breath

ANNA
This is nice Thank you

He nods

DECLAN
Sorry you won’t make it to Dublin before
the shops close

ANNA
I think you think I’m some kind of
shopoholic I have other interests you
know I do things I have a job

DECLAN
Doing what

ANNA
I stage houses Apartments actually I
stage apartments

DECLAN
Mmm

After a couple more steps
DECLAN (CONTD)
What is that exactly

ANNA
Well when somebody is trying to sell an
apartment they hire me to make it look
as good as possible I bring in new
furniture art plants everything I
completely “stage” it so it looks perfect
to a prospective buyer

DECLAN
Ah Okay And then if they buy it they
get to keep all the stuff

ANNA
Well no Actually they just get the
apartment

DECLAN
The empty flat
(beat)
I don’t get it

ANNA
I’m showing them what it could look like
DECLAN
But -- it won’t
ANNA
But it could
DECLAN
(getting it)

Ohhh So you dress up crap flats to fool
people into buying ‘em

ANNA
No I’m not fooling -- They’re very nice
apartments

DECLAN

So why do they need you
Anna stops How can she get him to understand
ANNA
I’m presenting possibilities The
possibility of a better place to live
Better things A better life

Declan scoffs
She hoofs

DECLAN
So you put in a whole bunch of stuff that
people don’t need to trick them into
buying a place that they don’t need

ANNA
They wouldn’t be looking for a new place
if they didn’t --
(frustrated)
You know what who are you to say what
people need and don’t need

on ahead Declan follows

DECLAN
What if your flat was on fire
ANNA
What
DECLAN
What if your flat was on fire and you
had sixty seconds to grab only the

most important things what would you
take

Anna doesn’t know how to respond

DECLAN (CONT’D)
That’s all you really need

ANNA
Well I’d take

She can’t come up with anything

DECLAN
It’s a simple question

Anna gets defensive

ANNA
I’m sure in your world everything can be
reduced to something that easy-peasy but
my life is very complicated

Declan scoffs

ANNA (CONTD)
I’ve got a job and a boyfriend and
events and all these friends and it just
never stops you just go and go -- we all
do the same things and have the same
things and

(MORE )

ANNA (CONTD)
then you have to get new things so you
can be the first one to have the things
and

(she stops overwhelmed)
There are just a lot of things Okay

Declan shrugs

DECLAN
But nothing to grab if your flat’s on
fire

Anna huffs Whatever She keeps walking
EXT BALLYCARBERY CASTLE - DAY

Anna finally crests the top of the ridge and sitting
all alone atop the hill are the abandoned RUINS of a 16th
century CASTLE Some walls have crumbled and sections
are overgrown with ivy and moss and grass -- but it’s
stunning And just beyond the castle are CLIFFS THAT
OVERLOOK THE SPARKLING SEA

Anna stops taking it all in It’s truly breathtaking

ANNA
It’s really --

DECLAN
Told ya

He nods Stares out at the view and doesn’t crack a
smile

ANNA
Okay

She looks around and notices a bronze PLAQUE by the
entrance

ANNA (CONTD)
Who are Dee-ar-mewed and Grayne Gra-
nay

DECLAN
Diarmuid and Grainne

(It’s pronounced DEER-MID and GRAW-NYA)

DECLAN (CONTD)
The legend How have you never heard it

ANNA
Because I’m not from Ireland
DECLAN
All right Squid all right

INT BALLYCARBERY CASTLE - DAY

They enter into the interior courtyard

DECLAN
Okay so hundreds of years ago the whole
of Ireland was ruled by bands of
warriors Real hard asses right Not
like those sissy knights in King Arthur
Anyway there was this beautiful young
woman Grainne who had been promised in
marriage to an old war lord named Fionn --

They pass under an arch that is centuries old

DECLAN (CONTD)
But Grainne didn’t love Fionn I mean he
was a real fart -- older than her Da and
on the night of their big betrothal
feast she met another warrior Diarmuid
He was young and handsome and -- you can
see where this is going -- So Grainne
slipped a sleeping potion in the guests’
drinks and convinced Diarmuid to run off
with her And they crossed the River
Shannon together

They head towards a winding moss covered staircase

Declan turns

DECLAN (CONTD)
When old Fionn woke up he went mental --
sent his entire army off to hunt them
down But the common folk took pity and
helped the young lovers hide in
farmhouses and forests and even castles
There are spots all over Ireland where
it’s said they once rested for the
night

DECLAN (CONTD)
Are you coming or what

ANNA
Is it safe

Declan holds his hands out He’s up there and fine

starts up

she’s still at the bottom of the staircase

Anna

DECLAN
Anyway rest was all they did See
Diarmuid felt guilty about betraying
Fionn and out of respect for him refused
to be intimate with Grainne

EXT BALLYCARBERY CASTLE - DAY

Declan and Anna emerge at the top of the CASTLE TURRET
The VIEW IS EVEN MORE BREATHTAKING UP HERE Anna gasps

DECLAN
- Until they came here To this castle
and this very same view And unable to
resist such beauty it’s said this is the
place where they finally consummated
their love

The wind blows at Anna’s hair She looks up at Declan for
a beat He’s looking back at her

ANNA

Oh my god you’re hitting on me
DECLAN

What
ANNA

So what so I’m the young woman on the
“eve of her engagement” who just “can’t
resist the handsome stranger” and runs
away with him You didn’t honestly think
that would work Honestly I’m
embarrassed for you

Declan laughs

DECLAN
Don’t flatter yourself dear The story’s
true but it sure as shite ain’t about

you

He looks at her and laughs again at the absurdity of the
thought Anna looks even more annoyed

ANNA
Then who’s it about

Declan doesn’t answer And that’s when they hear the
sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE Far away but unmistakable
Anna looks up

She hurries to the other side of the turret Where way
down in the valley she can see the TRAIN CHUGGING INTO
THE LITTLE STATION Looks like miles from here

ANNA (CONTD)
No NO THE TRAIN
(to Declan)
THE TRAIN

She takes off running down the stairs Declan sees the
train and chases after Anna

EXT LUSH HILLSIDE - DAY
More thunder as Anna runs as fast as she can from the

castle The wind is blowing The clouds gathering
quickly Declan chases after her

ANNA
We’re never gonna make it
DECLAN
Relax You’1l make it
ANNA
(calling out in futility)

HEY WAIT
She keeps running waving at the far away station
AND THEN IT STARTS RAINING HARD

ANNA (CONTD)
Oh great Of course --
(to Declan)
You had to take me up there
(imitating)
Oh the castle it’s grand

DECLAN
I was just trying to be nice

ANNA
Wow Remind me to thank you for making me
miss my train --

She LOSES HER FOOTING

ANNA (CONTD)
WHOA

And slips Anna goes TUMBLING DOWN THE HILLSIDE which is
quickly growing slick and muddy

DECLAN
That’s one way to get there

He watches her tumble for a beat

DECLAN (CONTD)
Hey Slow down Anna

Declan runs after her And then he SLIPS too
EXT LUSH HILLSIDE - DAY

Now they’re both TUMBLING and SLIDING DOWN THE MUDDY
HILLSIDE Anna is screaming Declan is laughing

Finally they both BOUNCE with a SPLASH into the base of
the hill Anna rolls to a soggy stop Declan is right
beside her He HELPS HER TO HER FEET Wipes the mud off
his face
DECLAN

Brilliant We made it down in half the

time
Anna looks at herself Completely covered in MUD And
still getting drenched from the rain Declan seems to be
enjoying this Anna just shouts at him

ANNA
AAAAAUGH

And she takes off running for the station
EXT CAHIRCIVEEN STATION - DAY
Anna is running full speed towards the platform

ANNA
I’m coming I’m coming Wait

And she hears the BRAKES RELEASE on the TRAIN CHSHHHH

ANNA (CONTD)
NO

And slowly the WHEELS START TO TURN

ANNA (CONTD)
WAIT

And quickly the TRAIN MOVES ALONG RIGHT ON OUT OF THE
STATION Anna reaches the stairs and runs up to the
platform to see the train chugging away down the track

ANNA (CONTD)
NOOOOO

But it’s gone She sees Frank Turns to him furious

ANNA (CONTD)
You said you could make them wait

FRANK
I did But I couldn’t hold ‘em forever
How was I supposed to know you were even
comin’ back

ANNA
You have my bags

Anna can’t handle this She is soaked and exhausted
Declan finally makes it up to the platform

DECLAN
That the last train today

Frank nods Indeed Then they hear a sound Like a rusty
squeak They turn and Anna has her mouth open about
to cry but the only sound coming out is the squeaking

Declan and Frank stare at her Not sure what to do And
then she bursts into TEARS BAWLING This has been a long
time coming The men are even more uncomfortable Frank
looks at Declan do something Declan looks at Frank you
do something Frank sighs

FRANK
Now now love We’1ll get you to Dublin

Anna is still crying
FRANK (CONTD)
Tell you what Me and the missus have a
nice little B and B up the road You can
stay with us until the next train in the
morning How does that sound

Anna just keeps crying Declan and Frank just stand
there Hoping she’1ll stop eventually

EXT FARMBandB - DAY
A remote FARMHOUSE
INT BandB - DAY

Frank walks Anna and Declan down a hallway Declan’s head
nearly scrapes the ceiling

FRANK
There’s a washroom at the end of the
hall it’s a share obviously The missus
stocks it with soap and shampoo I’ve
been telling her we should charge for it
but she says it’s what they do in the
fine hotels so what do I know

He eyes Declan

FRANK (CONTD)
And after you shave your face make sure
you clean the sink
(to Anna)
Nothin’ you haven’t told him a million
times eh

Declan touches his face self-conscious Doesn’t seem
like he was planning on that

ANNA
Actually --

FRANK
There’s nice folks from Italy spendin’
the night across the hall -- they’re
riding across the country on bicycles

He opens the door to their room

FRANK (CONTD)
Anyways here you go

INT GUEST ROOM - DAY

The room is about half the size of the tiny one at The
Aragh THE DOOR OPENS INTO THE BED which is the only
furniture in the room save for a tiny TABLE wedged in the
corner -- the sole purpose of which is to hold a BIBLE

It’s likely two people can’t have their feet on the floor
at the same time

FRANK
Youre very lucky you two The missus
tells me some a’ those backpackers came
by earlier to spend the night but it
turns out they weren’t married and she
sent ‘em packin’ We got rules in this
house

He looks right at them stern and gestures at the large
CRUCIFIX hanging over the bed

ANNA
Oh Oh Oh well we’re --

Declan cuts her off

DECLAN
A proper married couple Very proper

FRANK
I could tell Although I noticed you
weren’t wearing rings

DECLAN
She’s a very nervous traveler Won’t ever
bring her jewelry Wouldn’t even let me
bring mine

He gives Declan a nudge and a wink

FRANK
Women -- can’t live with ‘em can’t hit
‘em with a shovel

He laughs Declan joins in Declan PUTS AN ARM AROUND
ANNA jostling her a bit too hard

DECLAN
Know just what you mean

FRANK
Tea’s downstairs in ten

He exits Anna immediately ducks out from under Declan’s
arm

ANNA
That’s great

DECLAN
What did you want me to do We’re not
gonna walk down the road and find a
Hilton princess By the way overnight
stay’s gonna cost you a hundred extra

ANNA
Are you out of your mind You’re lucky
I’m still paying you anything at all And
no way are you sleeping in here with me
I’m so mad I can barely look at you let
alone share a room

DECLAN
We don’t got much choice sorry

Anna looks around the room There’s not even a chair to
sit in

ANNA
Fine I will sleep under the blankets
youll sleep on top You can shower
first

DECLAN
Is that a hint

ANNA
If you need one

Declan sniffs his own shirt He doesn’t seem that
bothered by it Then he slowly leans over to Anna she
tries to take a step back but can’t obviously He
INHALES HER SCENT It’s almost sexual

DECLAN
Least I don’t smell like sheep

Anna turns bright red Sniffs her coat

ANNA
I knew that I’1ll go first

He smirks and holds a hand out Go on She tries to
shimmy around to the door without actually touching him
It’s nearly impossible

INT BandB - DAY

Anna cleaned up now is in the living room having tea
with Frank and his wife EILEEN (60s) The place is
cluttered in a homey way and a fire roars in the
fireplace There are a few modern touches such as the
LARGE FLATSCREEN TV on which Frank is watching a soccer
match He periodically curses at the screen

As she fixes her tea Anna looks up at the wall covered
in OIL PORTRAITS

ANNA
I like your portraits

EILEEN
Oh weve got loads

FRANK
Loads My grandfather bought this
property at auction and the barn was
full of these paintings We don’t have
enough walls to hang ‘em all
Anna nods

ANNA
Seriously They must be really old
Have you had them appraised

FRANK
What do you mean

ANNA
Have an art expert come out and see what
they’re worth

FRANK

What for
ANNA

To -- see what they’re worth
EILEEN

I think what he’s trying to say darling
is why does it matter what they’re worth
We just like to look at them

Of course
EILEEN (CONTD)

So what brings you and your husband this
way

Anna is stumped for an answer

DECLAN (0S)
We’re headed to Dublin for an engagement
party Friends of Anna’s

Anna looks up Declan is in the doorway He’s clean and
he actually has SHAVED And he looks handsome

EILEEN
Well isn’t that nice

Anna’s still looking at Declan

ANNA
Yes It is

Eileen stands

EILEEN
Well I suppose the Italians will be back
from their ride soon Ill start supper

FRANK
Tonight’s menu is sour tripe with
dressing and fresh blood pudding

Anna swallows Definitely grossed out

EILEEN
Ooh and I got some fine jellied eel at
the shop this morning

Anna turns green Declan sees this

DECLAN
You know Mrs Logan I’m actually a cook
myself Since we’re crashing in on you at
the last minute

EILEEN
Japers you want to cook dinner How
about that Frank A man who wants to
cook dinner What do you know

Frank grumbles annoyed
DECLAN
Sorry not trying to make you look bad
Sir Anna Darlin’

Anna looks What Her

EILEEN
It’s very kind of you two

ANNA
Sure We do it all the time Cooking

EXT GARDEN - AFTERNOON

Anna and Declan stand in front of Eileen’s vegetable
garden He holds a BASKET and a BUCKET It’s still quite
muddy out here

ANNA
So uh what am I doing here

DECLAN
We’re gonna need some veg Start picking

She doesn’t move

ANNA
Like out of the ground

DECLAN
No Out of your arse Yes out of the
ground

He shakes his head and starts digging some potatoes out
from the ground Anna gingerly bends down to reach for a
carrot She doesn’t quite know how to approach it

ANNA
I live in a crowded city We don’t all
have the luxury of a private vegetable
garden

DECLAN
Yeah my heart’s bleeding for all that
youre lacking Well at least now I know
what to get you for a wedding present A
dose of reality

He laughs

ANNA
I know that this is all a big joke for
you but getting engaged is very
meaningful for most people

She grabs on to the carrot stem and starts pulling

ANNA (CONTD)
Jeremy and I have been a great team for
the past four years and to finally be
able to express our love with a lifelong
commitment -- Well it’s not something
Id expect you to understand

The carrot won’t budge She pulls harder

DECLAN
And who says I’ve never been engaged

Anna looks up surprised And the CARROT POPS OUT OF THE
GROUND sending her flat on her ass in the mud Declan
rolls his eyes

ANNA
You have

Declan walks over and literally LIFTS HER OFF THE GROUND
She’s astonished

DECLAN
You’re useless

He carries her over to a stump by the barn puts her down
like a package before she can even open her mouth Hands
her the bucket

DECLAN (CONTD)
Can you handle washing ‘em

Declan walks into the garden and begins to pick more
vegetables Anna starts rinsing the carrot in the bucket

ANNA
You shouldnt just -- pick people up like
that
He shrugs
ANNA (CONTD)
So -- when were you engaged

He doesn’t answer
ANNA (CONTD)
It was that blonde girl in the picture
wasn’t it

He ignores her question But she knows she’s right

ANNA (CONTD)
What happened

DECLAN
Nothing happened Didn’t work out

And it’s clear that’s all he’s going to say about it

ANNA
Oh That’s too bad

She admires her clean carrot for a beat as Declan dumps
some more vegetables in the bucket Anna takes a little
NIBBLE on her carrot

ANNA (CONTD)
Okay I picked a really good carrot

And then a CHICKEN comes waddling up toward Declan

ANNA (CONTD)
A chicken

Declan turns The chicken scurries over toward Anna She
talks to it in a funny voice

ANNA (CONTD)
It’s okay he’s not so scary

Declan raises an eyebrow The chicken comes right up to
Anna She’s fascinated

ANNA (CONTD)
Look how much she likes me

She starts making KISSING sounds to the chicken

ANNA (CONTD)
Hello Hello pretty chicken You think
she’s hungry

DECLAN
Don’t know won’t matter in a few
minutes

And in one swift move he GRABS the chicken by the neck
and scoops it up It SQUAWKS He takes an AXE off of the
coop wall

ANNA
What are you doing what are you doing

DECLAN
Killing the chicken

ANNA
What Why Why

DECLAN
For dinner Oh are you vegetarian

ANNA
No

DECLAN
Well where else are we gonna get
chicken

ANNA
(wishing)
At the market at a KFC someplace else

DECLAN
Youre being silly it all comes from the
same place Now hold the bucket so you
can catch the blood

Anna gasps and runs back to the house Declan shakes his
head

INT BandB KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Anna and Declan dump the last of their ingredients on the
farmhouse table

ANNA
Okay The first thing we should do is
make a plan Who’s doing what what needs
to get started first --

DECLAN
Or we could just cook

ANNA
This isn’t two old guys at your bar
having snacks We’ve got six people to
feed a hotel quality dinner we should
organize

Declan ignores her and takes a large KNIFE out of the
block He plunks a few ONIONS down in front of her

DECLAN
You know how to dice

ANNA
Yes I know how to dice

Declan sets to work on the chicken Anna peels an onion
not finished with this

He brings

ANNA (CONTD)

All right fine But you know what they
say If you fail to plan you might as
well plan to fail

DECLAN
Well here’s what I say The quickest way
to make God laugh is to start making
plans

a cleaver down hard on the chicken THWACK

DECLAN (CONTD)
Better to just let things work out how
they work out

ANNA

You know you and my dad would get along
great

DECLAN
Would we now

ANNA
It’s not a compliment

DECLAN
There’s a shocker

She shoots him a look Starts to CHOP her onion

ANNA
Do you know anything about Alpacas

DECLAN
Can’t say I do

ANNA
And neither did my dad but that didn’t
stop him from buying one when I was
fourteen He read in a magazine you could
make money selling the wool Didn’t
matter that he had no idea how to care
for it or even how to shear it or who
the hell he was supposed to sell the wool
to -- he just had a “good feeling about
it” Well turns out Alpacas don’t deal
with Boston winters very well and that
they’re not nearly as easy to housetrain
as advertised

She shudders at the memory Scrapes the cut onions to one
side as she talks

ANNA (CONTD)

And that carnations are actually
poisonous to them -- which made it a very
bittersweet Valentine’s Day that year
And it was the same story with the Amway
and the countertop rotisseries and the
mobile video store -- though at least
none of those will spit goo all over your
brand-new red cardigan -- but he had no
idea what to do once he maxed out his
credit card and the crap belonged to us
It was always “gonna work out” he always
“had a good feeling about it” -- until
one day the IRS shows up trying to
take our house

(Anna still looks unsettled

by it)
And that is no way to live

Anna nods certain Declan looks at her

DECLAN
Wait so you’re saying I can make money
if I just buy an alpaca

ANNA
(not all that amused)
Forget it

He laughs Tosses some CARROTS in front of her

DECLAN
Do some carrots

Anna looks at him pointedly waiting Declan realizes

DECLAN (CONTD)
Please

Satisfied she begins chopping carrots Declan begins
SLICING potatoes beside her They are silent but their
knives quickly fall into a rhythm

MONTAGE Anna and Declan continue cooking together
seamlessly working with and around each other to complete
the meal Stirring pots melting butter beating eggs
In the small space they are constantly reaching past
each other brushing by one another never actually
touching and not needing to speak -- maneuvering around
the kitchen in an unexpectedly graceful dance

ready for bed They undress facing in opposite
directions Declan sneaks a look at Anna just her bare
back as she pulls a nightgown over her head Anna turns
to see Declan pulling his t-shirt over his head And he
looks damn good shirtless

She quickly dives under the blankets on her side of the
bed

DECLAN
I uh don’t got any spare clothes I
could just -- I’ll keep these on

Still in his pants he lies down on top of the blankets
as promised on his side of the bed They lie there the
world’s largest wall of sexual tension between them

your bag to shut up -- which by the way
I’m charging you extra for

ANNA
Of course you are How about doing what
I’m actually paying you for which is to
get me to Dublin -- instead of leading me

can keep milking me for cash

DECLAN
Is that what you think I’m doing Ha
Trust me Squid I’1l be thrilled to get
rid of you in Dublin

The hall is packed with people dancing and drinking and
celebrating It looks like the entire town showed up for
this party We see four SHIRTLESS MEN standing on a
table drunkenly singshouting The Spice Girl’s “Wannabe”
as everyone cheers One of the guys falls off the table
and the rest keep right on singing We see old folks
dancing with young folks the PRIEST taking a turn on
electric bass A VIDEOGRAPHER gets it all down The
room is bursting with uninhibited joy

And in the back seated at one of the tables we find
Anna and Declan Anna has a small plate of food and
Declan seems to be drinking his meal -- knocking back a
SHOT of whiskey and then chasing it with a pint of
GUINNESS

ANNA
It was really nice of them to invite us
to stay
He belches in response Anna rolls her eyes
DECLAN
What I hate weddings I told you All

this Pointless

He grabs a CHAMPAGNE from a passing waiter

ANNA
Yet somehow you’re the one who was
engaged

He doesn’t respond Just downs the champagne Anna shakes
her head Meanwhile the BRIDE takes the MIC up on stage

BRIDE
Oi OI Shut it you drunks I want to
toast my husband

She seems quite tipsy herself The Groom is beside her
Everyone cheers and CLINKS THEIR SPOONS ON THEIR GLASSES
demanding that they kiss She grabs her new husband and
they go at it Everybody whistles

The Bride steadies herself at the mic

BRIDE (CONTD)
All right then All right Whoo Now I’m
nervous all of a sudden Glad I wrote
something down

She hikes up her gown and pulls some notepaper out her
garter The men WHISTLE The Groom puts his fists up
comically he’ll fight them all

GROOM
Oi That’s my wife you’re whistling at

BRIDE
My hero

Declan finds this all too cloying Rolls his eyes Declan
refills his whiskey from a bottle on the table

BRIDE (CONTD)
Paul It’s hard to believe we are finally
married When I look at you beside me I
think of all the wonderful memories weve
shared in such a short time --

Deckan laughs Whispers to Anna
DECLAN
Really She’s not gonna mention the shit

memories What a surprise

ANNA
Shh

She moves his whiskey away he’s had enough He simply
moves it back The bride continues

BRIDE
- And the thousands more we’ll create
together You me and the children we’ve
yet to have

DECLAN
(can’t help himself)
That one’1l gain four stone after the
first and Paul’1ll never leave the pub

He laughs Anna turns to him aghast He zips his lip

BRIDE
And I know lots of people have said this
before but it really is how I feel so
“My husband may you never steal lie or
cheat But if you must steal steal away
my sorrows If you must lie lie with me
all the nights of my life”

Anna looks at Declan waiting for the snide comment But
he’s listening now

BRIDE (CONT’D)

“And if you must cheat please cheat
death” because I couldn’t live a day
without you

Declan looks a little pale He quickly gets up knocking
his chair to the floor in the process The guests are
applauding the Bride’s heartfelt toast so Anna is the
only one to notice Declan rushes out of the room and
Anna quietly follows

EXT CHURCH MEETING HALL - DAY
Anna finds Declan up under a chilly old PORTICO
overlooking a small mossy cemetery There are lush hills

in the distance It’s still RAINING

DECLAN
Ahh go back inside would you

She looks at him gazing off at the cemetery He looks
tired

ANNA
Are you all right

DECLAN
I’m fine Hot as hell in there

And his voice sounds worse Sad
DECLAN (CONTD)
Go on You wanna be first in line when
she throws the flowers

ANNA
It’s a bouquet

He turns ready to respond but just doesn’t have it in

him

DECLAN
Who cares

He looks back out at the rain And it finally dawns on

Anna
ANNA
So the story was about you
DECLAN
What story
ANNA

The one you told at the castle The
princess who ran off with the warrior the
night before her wedding You’re Grada

DECLAN
Grainne

ANNA

DECLAN

Wrong Grainne was the girl

ANNA
So then you’re

DECLAN
The one who got left

ANNA

Declan waves his hand Whatever

ANNA (CONTD)
We don’t have to talk about it

There’s a long silence He finally speaks

DECLAN
She’s in Dublin

Anna nods She understands

ANNA
So you guys were engaged and she just

Declan nods Yep

DECLAN
Guy with a Range Rover

He manages a wry smile Anna looks embarrassed

ANNA
Have you You must miss her

Declan tries to be flip

DECLAN
Ahh She’s his problem now right

He looks off into the cemetery

DECLAN (CONTD)

Still I gave her my Ma’s ring -- her
claddagh Youve seen them with the two
hands holding the crowned heart

He puts his hands in the shape of the ring Anna
recognizes it

DECLAN (CONTD)
It’s tradition to use it as an engagement
ring It was one of the few things I had
left from my Ma Brilliant move there

He gives a bitter laugh Full of self loathing

ANNA
You know when we get to Dublin you
could find her And get it back

DECLAN
(scoffs)
Yeah I don’t think I’m gonna have much
need for that ring again

ANNA
You don’t know that You’ve got a lot
going for you You can cook wrangle
sheep rescue damsels You’re not
exactly the best wedding date but it’s
not like you’re a complete

DECLAN
Bastard who doesn’t know his arse from
his elbow

He smirks
ANNA

But you said it I didn’t

He laughs Finally Declan looks relieved to have
unburdened himself

INT CHURCH MEETING HALL - DAY
The BANDLEADER booms into the mic
BANDLEADER
All right lassies Let’s get all the
ladies up here for the slip jig

The FEMALES hoot and RUSH to the dance floor as the band
begins a TRADITIONAL IRISH SLIP JIG

Anna and Declan are walking back into the meeting hall as
the BRIDE rushes past on her way to the dance floor --
she stops and looks at Anna

BRIDE
Oi It’s Hail Girl C’mon

She tries to grab Anna and pull her along

ANNA
No that’s all right really --

BRIDE
All the ladies It’s unlucky not to
dance
ANNA
Actually I don’t --
DECLAN
Go on Don’t want to insult the bride

now
Declan laughs as the bride pulls Anna to the dancefloor

The Bride joins right in as the women start DANCING The
slip jig is a spirited high kicking traditional dance

with complicated rhythms (the music is beautiful but in
98 time -- not the easiest to follow)

Anna tries to hide on the edges of the group but the
ladies keep pulling her in trying to show her the steps

The men surround the dancers clapping and cheering Anna
attempts to follow along with some of the women and
begins to get some of the moves She’s awkward and off
but the woman encourage her Anna smiles and keeps
trying

Declan steps up to get a better look And he sees her
giving it her ungraceful best laughing at herself while
twirling and kicking And he can’t take his eyes off of
her

Anna looks up to see him looking at her He smiles warm
She smiles back at him They hold their gaze for a beat
and then Anna bumps into the girl next to her and has to
twirl back around to keep up with the dance

Eventually every DANCER gets a little solo moment in the
circle When Anna is up she’s confident enough to give it
a try She kicks and twirls and everyone cheers Declan
cheers her on too Getting confident she kicks her legs
even higher to big cheers She keeps going giving an
even higher kick -- sending her SHOE FLYING RIGHT OFF HER
FOOT sailing across the room and THUNK IT NAILS THE
PRIEST RIGHT IN THE HEAD He drops Everyone gasps Anna
looks horrified

INT CHURCH MEETING HALL - DAY

The PRIEST is now sitting at the table with a bag of ICE
on his head Anna stands next to him she feels awful

hell
ANNA
(taken aback)

EMPLOYEE behind a counter And a woman running a COFFEE
CART

Declan looks quite stunned -- and more than a little
wounded She’s gone He stands there holding the favor
box She didn’t even say goodbye

Declan turns to watch the bus drive away Just as Anna
walks out of the Ladies Room HE DOESN’T SEE HER

But Anna sees Declan We see him from her POV He’s
sullen watching the bus drive off looking hurt and
abandoned Anna takes this in for a beat then picks up a
BAG at the coffee cart Thanks the woman

She walks up to Declan pretending not to have seen his
private moment Takes two wrapped PASTRIES out of the
bag

ANNA
So apparently we’ve got one filled with
chocolate and the other one with some
sort of jam

He turns to see Anna coming towards him He looks
surprised and tries to cover

ANNA (CONTD)
And I absolutely can’t tell which is
which Here

He takes one still a little surprised

ANNA (CONTD)
Ooh and we have cake too Score

She puts the ticket in his hand

DECLAN

Youd think I was about to propose to
someone or something

DECLAN
Ah you still got one more day

ANNA
You’re right

They climb the staircase together

ANNA (CONTD)
Oh don’t let me forget your money

and

She digs in her purse as she walks She comes up with a
wad of bills

ANNA (CONT’D)

count it though

Declan regards it for a moment but doesn’t take it

DECLAN

ANNA
No --

DECLAN
It’s okay

ANNA

No we had a deal Come on two days of
misery We wrecked your car

Declan shakes his head No

DECLAN

Anna’s truly puzzled by this

ANNA
But --

She lets it go Because they’ve reached the top of the
stairs That’s it they can’t go any further and they
know it They stop there right at the top step

ANNA (CONTD)

Laughing he holds the camera out to Anna She looks at
the picture She does look completely stunned She
chuckles But then she sees him just at the edge of the
frame looking on DECLAN Anna’s smile fades a bit

Scroll through look at the others

She scrolls through a few more Like slow STOP-MOTION
Declan eventually disappears from the frame leaving only
Jeremy and Anna

register but then she’s shocked

KALEIGH

She straightens fixes her hair as he approaches her
KALEIGH (CONTD)

Kaleigh shrugs Takes a drag of her cigarette

KALEIGH

He found another girl to ride in his
Rover

Kaleigh shakes her head

KALEIGH

Declan exhales Rubs his head clearly confused Then

something catches his eye The CLADDAGH RING On a chain

around her neck

DECLAN
Look at that

He picks it up gently and holds it in his fingers

KALEIGH
I didn’t wear it with him I would never
But after it just made me You don’t

He looks at Kaleigh then back at the ring She looks
at him and smiles

up

INT CHIC RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Elegant trendy expensive We find Anna and Jeremy at a
candle lit table toasting with Champagne

JEREMY
Miss I see you’re wearing an engagement
ring Would this mean you’re off the
market

Anna plays along

ANNA
Why yes I am I’m engaged to a handsome
doctor He’s quite dashing

She puts her hand up by her throat showing off the ring
Jeremy looks at the ring and frowns

JEREMY
I shouldve gotten you a ring in Boston
I couldve done a lot better

He takes a drink

JEREMY (CONTD)
All the guy here wanted to do was sell me
this ring with two hands holding a heart
You know what I’m talking about

He butters a roll
JEREMY (CONTD)
He was bordering on aggressive I almost
walked out The thing didn’t even have a
diamond

She looks at him then at the ring on her hand

JEREMY (CONTD)
They’re big on lamb here Can we find

something minus lamb
ANNA

Kiss me

JEREMY
No you know what I’m sorry

Jeremy leans over and gives her a BIG KISS on the lips

JEREMY

He laughs

MARGO
Well we’re so happy for you guys We were

We were just waiting for the right time

DAVID

were planning on getting married

couples living here something about
showing them you’re taking your
commitment to the apartment and the
building seriously

JEREMY (CONTD)
Anyway next thing I know I just blurted
out “we’re getting engaged” Just like

it It was like ‘sure it’s kind of crazy
but you know what’ it’s right

He holds up Anna’s hand with the ring

Seated at a table in the center of the room He stops
stunned The CUSTOMERS grow quiet She waves awkwardly
but can’t suppress the smile on her face She stands

Declan approaches her His guard is up He’s gruff

DECLAN
What are you doing here

ANNA
I was sort of hoping for “hello”

DECLAN
Hello What’re you doing here

ANNA
Could you maybe be nice for a second I
did fly three thousand miles to get here
Plus a taxi ride We didn’t run into any
sheep though which really did cut the
travel time down

DECLAN
Oh is Jeremy with you

ANNA
What No

DECLAN
You said “we”

ANNA
I meant me Just me Jeremy and I broke

up
Declan relaxes a bit Looks a bit ashamed

DECLAN
Oh I’m -- I’m sorry

ANNA
Yeah well When my sixty seconds came
around I realized I had everything I
ever wanted but nothing I really
needed

The CUSTOMERS are now fixated on the action Declan opens
his mouth to speak but Anna keeps going

ANNA (CONT’D)
And this is definitely a little crazy but
I’ve logged about ten thousand miles
trying to propose to someone so that’s
what I’m going to do And I know it’s not
Leap Day but I’m still hoping for a yes

She takes a breath Everyone in the place hangs on her
words She looks really nervous This is a big leap for
her

ANNA (CONTD)
Declan Brady -- and I should probably
learn your middle name -- I know it was
only two days but I think what I need is
right here And I came back to see if
maybe you might think that too And if
you do well well I don’t have
anything really planned past that which
is a new one for me

She smiles

ANNA (CONTD)
But I propose we not make plans I
propose we give this a chance and just
let it work out how it works out

She exhales

ANNA (CONTD)
So what do you say Do you want to not
make plans with me

It’s dead silent Everyone awaits his response And he
just turns and WALKS AWAY BACK INTO THE KITCHEN No one
says a word Anna looks like she’s been punched but
tries to cover the shame

ANNA (CONTD)
So no Okay

(attempts a laugh)
I should uh go

She turns and walks quickly out of Caragh’s

EXT STREET - DAY

A shell-shocked and mortified Anna exits Caragh’s and
walks out into the street

ANNA
Oh my god That was awful why did I do
that

Tears spring to her eyes She walks faster

He holds up what he has in his hand Anna steps closer --
and see’s it’s the CLADDAGH RING

Anna smiles really

DECLAN (CONTD)
Honestly Squid a couple of days was all
I needed So hell no I don’t want to
“not make plans” with you I want to put
this ring on your finger Right now
Tonight

Anna beams near tears

ANNA

Declan stands takes her hand and slips the ring onto her
finger Looks down at her and smiles

DECLAN
I do

And they KISS A most spectacular kiss They break apart
Declan looks at her waiting for his answer

ANNA
I do too

He sweeps her up into a HUG and then sets her down

ANNA (CONTD)
I’m so relieved For a minute there I
thought I wasn’t going to have a place to
stay tonight

DECLAN
What you think you’re staying with me
All right but it’s gonna cost you extra

ANNA
Add it to my bill

They kiss again The crowd gathered on the street CHEERS
and APPLAUDS Joe and Seamus are there too

JOE
Look at that And on a Sunday no less
It’s good luck to get engaged on a
Sunday
