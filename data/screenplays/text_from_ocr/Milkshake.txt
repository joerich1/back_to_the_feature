INT OLD FASHIONED STAGE
Circa 1900

A white man in a top hat introduces the final act of a black
face performance

TOP HAT MAN
In the spirit of true minstrelsy
you have again shown that laughter
is the wine of life

Some 50 performers stand and break out into song
Roll credits to the music

An average American teenage boy begins to speak His name is
JOLIE

JOLIE
(VO)

All my life my parents have told
me I’m smart and talented That I
can be anything I wanna be when I
grow up Getting into the West
Branch Magnet Program was supposed
to be some kinda honor They probly
thought I’d grow up to be a doctor
or a lawyer or scientist that
cures cancer and junk I mean for
me school has always been a breeze

EXT SUBURBAN HIGH SCHOOL - CIRCA 1990
Now in the mid-90s for our story present day

JOLIE
(VO)
But when I look around I just feel
surrounded by dorks

Angle on an old school hoop on the horizon A kid silouettes
against the sky lays the ball in

JOLIE
(V0)
All I want is to be like the kids
on varisty who live in the Maple
Ave towers
EXT MAPLE AVE TOWERS - DAY

A part of a suburban neighborhood lines with huge apartment
buildings

JOLIE
(V0)
The maple ave kids are coming up
from nothing I mean their only
shot at college is balling And
they’ve got girls blowing up their
pagers twenty-four seven

Black kids play ball apartment buildings towering over them

INT BASKETBALL GYM
The young naive face of Jolie in the midst of tryout
JOLIE
(V0)

I pray to God I make varsity I’d

do anything to be like the Maple

Ave kids
Montage of tryout - Jolie the olny white kid among them
Suicide drills Push ups Machine gun defensive stand
exercises Scrimmaging Jolie is just a breath behind
everyone at pretty much all of them

And now Jolie is at the line A classic american basketball
tryout drill Miss and you run

All the players but Jolie watch from the baseline
Jolie lines up his shot carefully
He glaces at the coach who holds a clipboard

Jolie fires For a split second it’s dead on but then it
bricks wildly

The kids take off running
COACH
That was terrible
INT HENRIETTAS GOLDEN BEDROOM - MORNING

Sounds of a high pace video game begin
JOLIE in his tighty-whities plays Sonic on a Sega Genesis
Also on the bed black girl HENRIETTA AARONSON tries to do
her homework

HENRIETTA
Do you think youre gonna make
varsity

Jolie drops his controller and tears up

HENRIETTA
School is so wack

Jolie composes himself

JOLIE
I support you no matter what But I
cant be changin no diapers

Henrietta looks defeated
Jolie pauses Sonic Curls up with her

JOLIE
(voice over whisper)

Ive been fucking Henrietta for a
while Shes the best Shes
pregnant with someone elses baby
but Im cool with that In fact I
think thats why I like her so
much Shes kinda thugged out

Jolie rubs her stomach

JOLIE
Your stomachs smooth

Henrietta pops up

HENRIETTA
Not now Jolie

JOLIE
I think you look more beautiful
like this than anything I wish you
could be this way forever Wed be
so happy like this

A drop of sweat runs down Henriettas face and lands on a
sheet of paper full of algebra equations

JOLIE
I love you
INT HENRIETTAS LIVING ROOM - LATER

Jolie now clothed bounds down the stairs with bookbag and
basketball

JOLIE
Hey Mr Aaronson

MR AARONSON
(emerging from kitchen)
Hey

JOLIE
You got my check

MR AARONSON
Shit man those hours really add
up hun

Mr Aaronson grabs his checkbook off the top of the TV and
heads to the kitchen

JOLIE
I guess

Jolie flips on the TV and catchs a little of the OJ Simpson
trial

JOLIE

(V0)
Henrietta’s adopted She lives in a
big house like me Her parents pay
me to tutor her in geometry She’s
kind of an outcast I think that’s
why we click Plus our moms both
work for the same law firm They
fly all over the country doing
somethin’

Mr Aaronson flips off the TV

MR AARONSON
What a mess So how do you think
she’s doing Is she gonna pass

JOLIE
(stumbing)
Uh I dont know Maybe

Mr Aaronson tenses up then relaxes again and hands over the
check
MR AARONSON
I don’t get it She was always a
great student

JOLIE
(searching for word)
--you know Geometry’s a hard
thing Algebra leads to it and if
you dont get that then-

MR AARONSON
(interupting)
Yeah yeah I guess so Well you do
what you can

JOLIE
Yea

MR AARONSON
Peace out

JOLIE
Thanks

EXT WEST BRANCH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

The bells RINGS Ethnic murals line some of the walls others
are just the old school red brick

JOLIE
(VO)
My great great grandfather was a
famous black face performer

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Changing classes Kids of all shapes sizes and colors Jolie
emerges among them

JOLIE
They used to call him the greatest
performer of all time But now
Kids at school have never even
heard of him I mean not even
magnet kids in AP history have
heard of him

INT AP ENGLISH CLASSROOM

Jolie and his best friend HAROON are in the back Haroon’s a
scrawny Afghan boy with glasses
Haroon glances at his bulky calculator watch and raises his
hand

HAROON
Hey can I be excused for the
Million Man March

JOLIE

HAROON

They smack a secret handshake and Haroon exits
Alone Jolie looks longingly out the window

JOLIE
Lucky bastards

EXT SCHOOL PARKING LOT
Haroon waves good-bye to Jolie

Minority kids are hopping into cars with their march signs
psyched to be getting out of school

JOLIE
(voice over whisper)
This sucks All the minorities get
an excused absence for the Million
Man March
An almost white looking kid enters the frame

JOLIE
(V0)
But me Im stuck in school like a
bama

Haroon waves a last goodbye from his Nissan Saturn
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY
Jolie - still looking enviously out the window
JOLIE
(V0)

I wish I was one of them I wish I

INT HENRIETTAS GOLDEN BEDROOM - DAY

Henrietta rocks out to her walk-man while jamming on some
homework

Jolie’s in his underwear again playing Sonic

JOLIE
(V0)
I’m supposed to tutor Henrietta
every Sunday She’s getting an F in
math She knows how to do it
though She’s flunking on purpose

Jolie looks back at Henrietta and smiles to himself
JOLIE
(V0)

She’s so gangster
INT HENRIETTA’S LIVINGROOM - LATER
Jolie clothed bounds down the steps again this time two at
a time
EXT TOWN ESTABLISHING SHOTS

Suburban homes with large apartments towers in the
background The school is in the more urban part of town
EXT WESTBRANCH SCHOOL GYM

The doors spray-painted “thug life”

EXT WEST BRANCH HS TRACK AND FIELD
Jolie and Haroon sit on the hill doing homework
HAROON

arrested

SMASH CUT TO
INT BLAIR BLAZER GYM

FRANCISCO bare chested struggles against a security guard
He looks directly into the camera

FRANSISCO

JOLIE
(voice over whisper)

My great great grandfather had a
song Hallelujah Im a Bum Tupac

NIGGA so we can get drunk and

thought they were really similar

INT WEST BRANCH BIO CLASS - LATER
Haroon and Jolie in identical poses

HAROON

They raise their hands - again in identical positions

INT BATHROOM

Haroon in the stall taking a dump

Jolie at the urinal - simultaneously pounding a Sunkist and

taking a whiz

HAROON

I’m taking the most epic shit Oh

Jolie looks suddenly worried It dawns on him

HAROON

Don’t forget I need my computer

homework back Jolie
INT D HALL
Jolie rushes toward the camera

JOLIE
(V0)

As a white boy at West Branch I’m

just not cool

He rushes off

He’s zeroing in on a wall full of sports posters - at it’s
center a golden piece of paper labled “THE TEAM”
JOLIE
(vO)
But making the team would change my
life forever

Jolie looks down the list

JOLIE
(V0)
It’s my one shot to fit in with the
Maple Ave kids To actually be
somebody

Jolie’s face brightens
Jolie walks past it and does a double take
Its the list
CLOSE ON JOLIES EYES pure intensity
He stands motionless holding his breath reading
Then leans back covering his dropped jaw
JOLIE
(voice over whisper)
Making the team felt like the most
important thing in my life

Jolie takes off running down the hall past a mop leaning
against the wall

JOLIE
(voice over whisper)
As a white boy I just didn’t fit
in not in Takoma Park But now

Jolie becomes a black silhouette against a row of windows

JOLIE
(voice over whisper)
I was practically black

EXT SPARSE WOODS - DAY

Jolie in his gold Webber jersey hops in the woods He wears
large purple ankle weights and Jump Soles (clunky and
clumsy looking work out shoes)

JOLIE
(voice over whisper)
I even ditched class to work on my
hops
Exhausted Jolie gathers his basketball and backpack and
leaves

A metro train roars past in the background
INT JOLIES JUNKY BASEMENT - NO WINDOWS
Jolie is bench pressing and Haroon is spotting
A single florescent fixture hangs overhead
HAROON
Man I cant believe you made the
team
Jolie finishes his set Pops up
JOLIE
I was the last bama on the list If
Francisco hadnt been arrested Id
still be a loser Id be just
another Joe Shmoe Lame-oh geek in
the Blair High School Magnet
CLOSE ON HAROON his face slowly falls
JOLIE
Oh hey can your mom give you a
ride home later Theres something

I gotta do

HAROON
Oh Yeah Yeah That’s cool

They rotate positions - we see that Jolie has only been
lifting 5 lb weights

JOLIE
25s right

HAROON
Yeah

Jolie leans down on the bar and grins to himself - still on
cloud nine

EXT STREETS OF TAKOMA PARK - DAY

A shiny cherry-red 93 Nissan Quest approaches
JOLIE
(voice over whispering)
Tupac Biggie Snoop Dog Easy-E
Dr Dre Suge Knight Mr T

The Quest pulls to the curb - Jolie and his Dad inside

JOLIES DAD
Alright bye No injuries

Jolie hops out in black and red basketball gear - black
headband black Jordans even black socks

JOLIE
Alright bye Dad

A clunker 90s cell phone rings Jolie’s Dad answers

JOLIES DAD
Hey you back from the hill What
happened

EXT SMALL CLEARING IN THE WOODS
Henrietta sits alone on a stump listening to her Walkman
Jolie bounds down a path startling her
HENRIETTA
It smells like dog shit in these

woods Jolie Why’d you want to
meet out here anyway

Jolie chokes up

JOLIE
Wow That is pretty bad It smells
like a dead mouse or something

HENRIETTA
You dont want to be seen with me do

JOLIE
-what No
Henrietta softens
HENRIETTA

You wanna make out with me
JOLIE
Yea but I cant Not no more We

HENRIETTA

JOLIE

Henrietta I told you I made the

Jolie hacks up some spit
JOLIE (CONTD)
Look If I make the NBA Im gonna
take care of you and your baby
Were gonna live in a big house in
Potomac Be rich have maids
That’s the reason I’m doing this
Can’t you see that Can’t you be
happy for me
Henrietta shakes her head in utter disappointment
She drops Jolie’s basketball and walks off
Pregnant her ass might be a little bigger than before
Then she stops and turns
Jolie spins his basketball on one finger
JOLIE
Do you need a token for the bus or
some junk

Crushed Henrietta leaves

Jolie watches her descend through a romantic archway of brush
- a blacktop and basketball hoop in the distance

JOLIE
(voice over)
I felt bad but

Jolie darts up the hill - basketball in hand
JOLIE (CONTD)
(voice over)
Henrietta had rich white parents
And after I made the team

CLOSE ON his black shoes and socks

JOLIE (CONTD)
(voice over)
I realized compared to me she
wasnt thugged out at all She was
just bad at Algebra

Jolie disappears into the woods
JOLIE (CONTD)
(voice over)
For a while I was worried her Dad
Mr Aaronson would be mad

Jolie runs past a jungle gym with a little boy hanging from
the monkey bars

JOLIE (CONTD)
(voice over)
But he was cool He even offered me
20 bucks to mow the lawn So
everything worked out
Jolie jogs past a pregnant woman
JOLIE
(voice over)
I guess
INT LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT (BUT NO WINDOWS)

The blazers dress after practice everyone chatting among the
many aisles But Jolie is all alone in an aisle by himself

Jolie slams the locker door
INT BASKETBALL GYM - NIGHT
Jolie is deep on the bench

The acoustics are bad The semi full bleachers fill the space
with echoes

The crowd is various shades of black A lot of them have
their feet kicked up

Classic red versus blue
The action on the court is fast paced The players are
disciplined setting screens and running concrete plays

WENDEL a guard pulls up for a shot - swish
The cheerleaders get excited

The home score flashes red and reappears as 86 to 52 A blow
out

The team of Blair Blazers sit together their heads moving in
unison following the action

At the end of the bench are ARIUS and Jolie ARIUS covered

in sweat is a tall thin care-free light-skinned black kid
He has a huge scar on his head a thick red headband and band-
aids over his earrings

Jolie is bone dry and still in his warm up suit
ARIUS

Now it comes with two free
controllers and the game

JOLIE
(not paying attention)
Oh yeah
ARIUS

Yeah We were playing that joint at
my place and one of the
cheerleaders was all confessing how
cute she thinks you are

JOLIE
(excited)
Which one

ARIUS
(points to the cheerleader
bench)
Christine Ortanyez

Jolie focuses in on a particularly cute Panamanian
cheerleader - CHRISTINE ORTANYEZ

JOLIE POV slow motion of Christine - taps her palms and does
a leg kick then looks directly at us

COACH DALE
Jolie

Jolie flinches
Coach Dale - in afine suit and gold rimmed glasses - glares

COACH DALE(CONTD)
Get Pistol

Jolie rips off his warm-ups in a panic The shirt gets stuck
over his head then he trips over his pants

His teammates look on with various expressions of concern and
laughter

A cheerleader from the opposing team points and giggles

REDHEAD GRUNGE KID Unsnap it

Struggling Jolie frees himself

Coach Dale shakes his head and so does the fat black man
directly behind him Their expressions match exactly

The old white referee blows his whistle hard - game over
All the Blazers start high-fiving each other but Jolie
INT JOLIES MESSY ROOM - NIGHT

A six foot long poster of a 91 Lamborghini Countach covers
the wall A Nerf basketball hoop hangs on the closed door

Haroon is dressed up as a woman using a wig socks as
breasts and a sheet as a skirt

HAROON
Come on man weve gotta nail the
Marion Barry skit tomorrow or Im

JOLIE

Jolie throws an African hat and tap shoes off his bed and
they smash against the wall

HAROON
Dude its was just a preseason
game come on

JOLIE
Man if I cant get in when were
up thirty in the preseason then Im
never gonna play
Jolie pulls off his jersey and throws it down He picks up a
switch blade and looks at his warped reflection

HAROON
He tried to put you in the game

JOLIE
Yeah for thirty seconds

Theres a knock on the door
Jolie wipes a teary eye and straights up

ELLIOTT Jolies oddly old dad - enters with a bright orange
Nerf ball off the bedside table

ELLIOTT
Three Two

Elliott dunks and freezes in mid air

He makes the sounds of a sold out crowd animatedly ina
comforting way

The kids smile

ELLIOTT
Come on Haroon Lets get you

JOLIE
Already

Haroon follows him down the steps
HAROON

Elliott will you go over this skit

There voices fade into silence
Jolie stands alone grabs a dumb bell and does a few curls
He pushes it up his bicpt with his hand so that it looks
bigger
INT HENRIETTAS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jolie climbs in through the window

The only light in the room comes from the Sega on pause
HENRIETTA

Jolie kissed her with lots of tongue

HENRIETTA

Henrietta

HENRIETTA

EXT HENRIETTAS MOONLIT HOME
The automatic sprinkler goes off

HENRIETTA (CONT’D)
The thing is He’s not like other
guys I mean he’s on the team but
he’s not really a cool kid I’ve
always hated the cool kids

Jolie steps off the porch and trips on a crack in the
sidewalk

INT DIMLY LIT GIGANTIC AUDITORIUM - DAY

from the portables (trailer classrooms)

A school bell rings

EXT CONVENIENT STORE

Henrietta approaches the Redhead Grunge Kid They’re both
skipping class

Jolie and Christine cut through the chaotic after school

Her hair and cheerleader skirt blowing back Jolie stands

The camera’s under here Come on

She crawls under the trampoline through the glittery tassels
hanging around its edges

Jolie hesitates then follows but we stay behind A pom-pom
and a basketball rest in the foreground

The season hadnt even started and
my life had changed forever

Just below the tassels Christines top lands on the floor

RAY

JOLIE
(voice over)
It felt like a million bucks

Haroon pumps his fist yes as someone gets a shot past the
goalie in warm ups

Christine fixes her hair and walks out with a VHS camcorder

JOLIE
(voice over)
I felt guilty cuz of Henrietta but
as Tu Pac says Only God can judge
me

Jolie stands behind in the doorway fixing his belt and
getting a touch of wind from the fan

JOLIE
(voice over)
I did wonder if Henriettas Dad
Mr Aaronson even knew she was
pregnant

Jolie takes a last glimpse of the intermural floor hockey
game below them

JOLIE
(voice over)
But for some reason it just never
came up

Jolie ducks into the stairwell
Then all the lights go out
Blackness

Hold

Haroon walks into a small shaft of light that goes unseen
until it has his face to land on

HAROON
(off camera)
Would someone please stop messing
around and put the lights on This
league is for serious players only

Haroon puts on his RoboCop goalie mask BAM He is body
checked to the floor

RAY
Boom Step aside nigga
Haroon slouched against the wall - blood dripping from his
temple

HAROON
(cringing in pain almost
crying)
Oww man I think you broke my
wrist

a move on her I’m gonna eat your

clear

Jolie and Wendel scope out an escape route - the security
guard no longer at the door

JOLIE

They peek into the hallway and see security round a bend

Jolie and Wendel run as quietly as possible in the opposite
direction

Cheerleader

JOLIE
Come on Enough with that I washed
my hands already So I can please
you

HENRIETTA
Just tell me yall are hooking up
It’s OK if you are I just want the
truth

JOLIE
You want the truth How is this

Jolie reveals a plastic case meant for baseball cards Out of
it he slides a small newspaper cut out

A picture of Francisco getting arrested with the headline
“Sex Video Arrest’

HENRIETTA
(ashamed)
Yeah Francisco got arrested What
about it

JOLIE
I thought you said you didnt fuck
any of them

HENRIETTA
I didnt
JOLIE
Did you suck their dicks
HENRIETTA
Jolie Its none of your fucking
business
JOLIE

Well everyone at school says you
did And now they’re saying there’s
a video and that’s why Francisco
and Merly got arrested

HENRIETTA
They’re not arrested They got
questioned and shit and then they
got suspended
JOLIE
How do you know

HENRIETTA
Because I hear all the Maple Ave
stuff

Haroon pretends to watch the movie but is obviously
uncomfortable

HAROON
Shhh It’s getting good you know

Henrietta and Jolie whisper more quietly

HENRIETTA
Look that’s all beside the point
Whatever you heard about me at
school they dont know shit It’s
a lie I already told you I ran
away from home That’s it Now
leave me alone

JOLIE
Why did you let them take pictures
HENRIETTA
I told you I needed money
JOLIE

HENRIETTA

Duh an abortion Does that make
you feel better But I decided I
want this baby Jolie I want a real
family So I went to Pizza Hut for
dinner instead The one on
University Boulevard do you want a
receipt or something

JOLIE

HENRIETTA

machine Now stop it

Henrietta is on the verge of tears and it cracks Jolie
JOLIE

Dang I know I’m sorry I’m such
an idiot
HENRIETTA
But I love you I just want to be
with you now And put all that in
the past

JOLIE
Why didnt you come to me then

HENRIETTA
We had just met

JOLIE
I know Damn it You could have

slept on my couch easy My parents

We hear a killing on the screen
They kiss

The color cast on them shifts from a blue to a red Jolie
reaches under the starter jacket that lies across her lap

HENRIETTA
Jolie No

JOLIE
You lied to me

HENRIETTA
I didnt I would never

JOLIE
How do I know

Henrietta guides his hand up between her legs and she closes
her eyes succumbing to his fingers

HENRIETTA
Dont you trust me

From behind them they are silhouettes against the Ice-T
action pic Surviving the Game

A baby is crying somewhere in the theater

The red light cast on them begins to flash rapidly In and
out of blackness

Jolie peaks at a boy one seat away (Jolies basketball is in
the seat between them with Haroons Batman toy sitting atop
it)

Henrietta breathes hard
Jolie bites his lower lip

Jolie sheepishly leaves Haroon alone with Mr Applebaum

INT HALLWAY

Jolie walks down a packed hallway and ducks into an office
door
As Coach Dale leaves his office Arius catches the door The
team slips in one by one All hanging out nearby

INT BASKETBALL COACH OFFICE - DAY

Pictures and trophies are all over the cramped room spanning
decades

The team and a group of cheerleaders are hanging out waiting
for the video

Arius pops the tape in

ARIUS
Look look look Look Right here

Ad-lib hollers
Some laugh

ARIUS (CONTD)

Everyone laughs but Jolie

GUY BEHIND THE CAMERA

HENRIETTA
(affecting a sexy voice)
Hed knock me out for the rest of

The kids in the room break out into ad-lib excitement

ARIUS
Pause it Pause it Pause it Look

In the background of the video is a doorway to a hallway
crouched on the floor as if waiting for a long time is
Francisco

CHRISTINE
Coach Dale is coming Im serious
He’s coming now

and

Wendel flips on the Sega Genesis John Madden 95 appears on

the screen
Christine and Wendel each grab a controller
Coach Dale enters
COACH DALE

The cheerleaders gather themselves
Coach Dale tries to insert the game tape but the VHS of
Henrietta is still inside He ejects the mystery tape looks
at it unlabeled and puts it in his bag

COACH DALE
(cont )
Girls you are welcome to watch but
please keep it down we have our
work cut out for us

The cheerleaders leave Christine the last to straggle along
grabs Jolie’s hand briefly on the way out

Coach Dale turn off the lights and presses play on the game
tape

Arius considers swiping the VHS So does Jolie But there’s
no opportunity

The low quality recording of a game plays one pixilated
long take

The blue team scores The white team - THE BLAZERS - in-bound
the ball and the camera pans following the action The video
as primitive as it gets

Jolie is in a daze about what has seen with Henrietta
Coach Dale pauses the tape

COACH DALE
Now what was wrong with that shot
(beat)
Jolie

ARIUS
He shot on the first pass of a half
court set

COACH DALE

(scowling at the coach)
Do I look like white to you
Beat

Coach Dale assails Arius wrestling him into a hold on the
floor

COACH DALE
How does it feel
ARIUS
Owwww My arm

The other players stand back feeling awkward about the semi-
abusive coach

COACH DALE
How does it feel
ARIUS
Ah Ah Ah
COACH DALE
Look in my eyes How does it feel
ARIUS
Ahhhhhh
COACH DALE

If I ever see you back away from a
rebound again Im gonna bench you

second the whole year You got that
boy

Arius pinned and cringing squirms eyes tearing shirt
bunching up and revealing a tatoo on his back for Maple
Ave

While everyone’s distracted Jolie eyes the bag with the VHS
inching closer Just as he’s about to make his move the coach
release Arius and sits back down

Then he pounces on Arius again and Jolie quickly grab the
tape

ARIUS
Ahhhhh

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

JOLIE

DISSOLVE TO
INT FANTASY SMOKE FILLED BASKETBALL COURT
A spotlit Jolie dribbling down a seemingly endless court
Faint roars of an unseen sell-out crowd cheer him on
JOLIE
(voice over)
In my head I kept thinking about
dribbling a basketball down an
endless basketball court playing
point guard in the biggest game of
the year The Springbrook game
A spotlit Christine does a cartwheel followed by a split
JOLIE
(voice over)

That kept me focused so I wouldnt
bust in about two seconds
Jolie looks down at his soiled pants forgetting his
basketball that bounces off into darkness

JOLIE
(voice over)
I was gonna pull out but
Three old white referees also spotlit are blowing their
whistles and pointing furiously at Jolie as they charge
closer revealing they all have the face of Mr Aaronson

BACK TO

INT JOLIES BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
Jolies face of extreme worry

JOLIE
Uh I better not keep going

CHRISTINE

(under her breath)
Oh Fuck

Silence
Christine takes a few second to cool off

CHRISTINE
Have any music we can listen to

JOLIE
Yea

Jolie grabs some sheets around him and walks over to desk
with CDs and junk In a sneeky manor he grabs a tissue and
wipes himself clean then grabs a Handi-Snacks wrapper and
throws them in the trash together

Then he pulls out an All Eyes on Me CD We get a long close
up of the cover

The music begins to play
Jolie and Christine cuddle

CHRISTINE

The crossroads Two huge four lane roads cross to form a
massive intersection Behind it a Taco Bell parking lot full
of cars

A short line at the Drive-Thru
Kids from the team are hanging out by Jolies Toyota Camry

JOLIE
(voice over)
As the season rolled on the Taco
Hut became the spot to be Some

They eye a girly looking chain that locks a new forest green
girls mountain bike to a bike rack

WENDEL
I dont think so The rack things

Arius contemplates breaking the lock He sips the last of his
huge soda the cup still heavy from ice and launches it over
a few parked cars It crashes loudly in a dumpster

ARIUS
Arright chall

Arius walks away toward the rack

He yanks the new shiny green mountain bike with two arms up
toward his chest The entire bike rack jerks off the ground
but the lock doesnt break

Arius walks on like nothing has happened Disappears among
the parked cars - the sun setting behind them

INT BLAIR BLAZERS HIGH SCHOOL FOYER

A large entrance-way with drop ceilings a black floor and
red trim

divided into four like something out of a gladiator movie

It’s lunch period and kids from the team are hanging out
Jolie Haroon Vlad and Christine are nearby

CHRISTINE

Ray walking past intentionally brushes Haroon with his
shoulder Haroon drops his Handisnacks - his crackers
crumbling across the floor

ARIUS

In a flash Arius wrenches Ray by the collar swings him
around into the tall windows and they slam into them

ARIUS
Say it again

Ray throws a punch and a fight breaks out Kids come running
to watch from different classrooms

Arius gets Ray by the collar again and swing him around into
the window but this time they fall through the glass

Ray lands on his back outside Arius falls forward hanging
half out of the window and glass punctures his gut

ARIUS
My fucking gut Im bleeding all

RAY
Ah fuck man Im OK I think Im

A large crowd has gathered around the blood and broken window
in the aftermath of a fight

HAROON
Whoa dude That is a lot of blood

Arius hobbles around leaving a trail of blood on the linoleum
tiles as Principal Ganus and Mr Applebaum appear on the
scene and hold him up

PRINCIPAL GANUS
An ambulance is on the way

Arius is hobbled out Ray is shepparded off by Mr
Applebaum

A trail of small spats of blood across the linoleum floor

Principal Ganus is surveying the scene with a few of the kids
who were present

Brightly lit A home game Everything is red white and
black

The glossy floor shines like it has just been polished

Go-go music blasting over the sub-par audio system fades

The fifteen Blair Blazers in their red and white warm ups
have taken center court for a ritual

Huddled in a pack hunched over and jumbled together with
their arms around each other swaying back and forth they
get pumped up

Jolie trots the isle of his teammates Wendel stoically slaps

Jolies smile fades and we see he has spotted Henrietta in
the crowd and not far from her - Christine

Whistle
SMASH CUT TO

The noises of the game and crowd are very frantic and
everything is fast paced

Coach Dale looks at the clock - 30 second left Blair is down

COACH DALE
Jolie Get back in the game Take
Pistol

Jolie barrels toward check-in ripping off his warm-ups (top
and bottom) squats at mid court - the buzzer sounds - he
taps Pistol an underhand five

JOLIE
Who you got

Pistol points at a huge BLOND DUDE who pounds his chest
ferociously

A buzzer indicating a substitution

Jolie is passed the ball - he puts a quick move on his man
jab step and cross slicing through the lane He fakes a pass
behind his back and goes up for a lay up when his shot is
blocked and he is slammed violently by a help-side defender
The ref blows his whistle hard and gestures - calls a foul
Jolie is on the ground in pain holding his hand wincing

INT JOLSONS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jolie still in his basketball attire looks down over a large
bandage on his thumb

The microwave buzzes

ELLIOTT

A paper on the floor is marked with a big fat red F with a
circle around it

A note is paper-clipped to the corner of the page

Henrietta shrieks again - launches her TI-81 Calculator at
Mr Aaronson who dodges and it breaks a few plates that were
on display

Mr Aaronson acts fast

MR AARONSON
(mumbling)
Youre gonna break this thing

He checks the calculator and bee lines for the phone

anger)

They pass a Black Volvo and an old Red Volkswagen Bug and
Golden Retriever sleeping in the yard

They hop into the Minivan Jolie takes a big bite of the rice
crispy treat as they drive past a speed hump sign

JOLIE

(voice over)
It must have been good for
Henrietta too because afterwords
she didn’t mention joining the team
to the Bowe fight she didn’t
mention Christine she didnt
mention nothing

As they drive off Jolie looks back at Henriettas home
getting smaller and smaller A speed hump sign in the

Haroon and Jolie walk threw looking for their friends we
take in the setting as they do

An old dude finishes a coke through a straw we hear the loud
bubbling noise The giant plastic cup has a picture of
Muhammad Ali in his prime
B and W Muhammad Ali posters fill the walls Ali stands in
glory over his unconscious opponents or lays blows to their
faces sweat frozen in the air as it flies from their bodies

The food is laid out cafeteria style The tables and booths
are a step above any fast food joint Televisions hang from
every angle some even face the streets to attract
pedestrians

On every television without exception a boxing match Bowe
versus a large white guy Golota

Watching are about a hundred and fifty black people of all
ages mostly male packing the restaurant

The crowd subdued by the early rounds
Jolie finds his friends from the team and their girlfriends
lining the shinny metal railing that guides people along the

buffet style assortment of chicken and biscuits

Jolie is the only white person in the whole spot

Haroon peels off as the crowd ad-libs excitement Jolie looks
to the match

We see the fight itself close up on the television
Bowe has Golota cornered

A couple of blows are deflected and Golota the lug clinches
Bowe in a bear hug

Disappointment from the crowd

WENDEL
A sucker move

The crowd roars again but this time they rush to the windows
- jostle for a view of the street where

INTEXT MUHAMMAD ALIS CHICKEN
Two black kids wrestle on the sidewalk
We see Haroon behind them on the pay-phone watching

The kids fighting have jeans that are falling off and one of
them has lost a gym shoe

In the windows everyone cheers them on pounding the
Plexiglas Including Jolie and Christine

Above them in the windows are two televisions of the fight
that face the street In the TV the boxers and the referee
shuffle aimlessly around the ring

The kids on the sidewalk are scrappy they grab and stretch
at shirts neither can escape the others grasp

They reach a stalemate knotted awkwardly and exhausted fury
replaced by heavy breathing one has a bloody nose and a huge
scratch on the cheek

FIGHT KID 1
You ripped my Polo shit
motherfucker You ripped my Polo
shit

FIGHT KID 2
You scratched my face nigger

The crowd watches the stalemate and the cheering and pounding
mellows slowly they bore returning to their seats

Suddenly on the television there is a whirlwind of action and
punches are chaotically thrown by both fighters
The crowd erupts at the televisions
The kids on the sidewalk remain tangled breathing hard

On television Golota throws a combo of blows below the belt
and Bowe tumbles to the mat The referee jumps and waves
furiously at the penalty which he reports to the judges in a
series of arm waves and animated hand signals

We see the people in the front rows at the boxing match
almost all white and wearing glamorous suits and dresses

The patrons go berserk

Extreme close-up on the replay Golota pounding Bowe in the
nuts Bowes face distorted in pain

Ad-lib excitement from everyone but Jolie who is looking over
at the entrance

JOLIE

(voice over)
Strangely Henrietta never showed I
should have been relieved but
instead I felt awful It was like
yesterday we were in love and today
she didn’t even care I was with

hes the new champion of the boxing world

Jolie ponders the situation Haroon shakes his head

Jolie pulls out a magic marker and begins to write on the
car

HAROON
Magic marker That is so lame

Haroon pops the top of his spray can and begins to shake it

INT JOLIE’S BASEMENT - NIGHT
Lit by a TV the room could be its own apartment

Wendel sleeps with a Super Nintendo controllers in his laps
on a futon Arius Codroy and a few kids from the team are
asleep all around the room

JOLIE
(V0)
Once everyone heard that I got
Christine pregnant it was like I
was the coolest kid in school

JOLIE (contd)
All the kids from the team wanted
to hang at my place while my
parents were gone And even some
cheerleaders came too

Christine and Jolie make-out lying on the floorpower pad

JOLIE
(VO cont)
I told them all it was Haroon who
spray-painted ‘Free Mike Tyson’
and even he was cool too

Haroon half asleep sparking the tail end of a blunt

JOLIE
(VO cont)
We even smoked a blunt It was our
first time gettng blazed and drunk

Soda cans crumbs bags of chips and other treats and
wrappers are scattered around

On the television the audience laughs wildly at a Monkey
doing sign language on the Carson show

JOHNNY CARSON
(on television)
Whats he saying now Whats he
signing

The guest interprets

GUEST
(on television)
He wants to say he loves you all
and he wishes he could hang onto

The Carson crowd laughs wildly
Jolies hand slides up Christines skirt

Henrietta starts crying

JOLIE

Henrietta

HENRIETTA
You think I’m a fool I watched you
make out with her on the Power-pad

Crying Henrietta exits

The basketball team and cheerleaders have woken up from the
argument and are now enraptured by the drama
Jolie and Haroon looks like dear in headlights

CHRISTINE
All this time you’ve been hooking
up with some pregnant girl failing
out of school I am so fucking
humiliated right now Don’t you

Christine and three other cheerleaders leave the party

WENDEL

bounced

ARIUS

Yea let’s get out of here

The kids from the team leave and Jolie and Haroon stand
alone

HAROON
Damn man I better go too This
shit is too fucked up right now

Jolie stands all alone

EXT MAPLE AVE - NIGHT
The street sign reads Maple Ave

It is lined with tall apartment buildings Government
housing Bus stops And cheap liquor stores and sub shops

Jolie walks down the street

JOLIE
(VO)
The next day I found out Christine
had the abortion on her own She
said she asked the doctor to see
the fetus

Jolie approached one of the apartment buildings
JOLIE
(VO cont)
The doctor said she wasn’t supposed

to showed it but did anyway

Jolie buzzes up to an apartment
INT MAPLE AVE APARTMENTS - NIGHT
ELEVATOR
Jolie rises

JOLIE

(VO cont)
Christine said the dead fetus
looked like a baby squirrel Like
the ones that fall out of the nest
and are on the sidewalk dead with
no fur yet I guess it went well
though

ARIUS’S APARTMENT
The living room of a small dim one bedroom
Sensual RandB tunes play softly from a small radio

JOLIE
(VO cont)
After that Arius said not to worry
about anything That Christine
would be cool and Henrietta was
just fucked up anyway

A gold cross hangs on the fake wood paneling with some framed
family photos at a summer bar-b-que a wedding and the
beach

JOLIE
(VO cont)
He even invited me back to his
place It was the first time I had
ever been to Maple ave

Four kids from the team are playing cards around a coffee
table for one dollar bills siting mostly on a puffy floral
patterned couch covered in shinny plastic

JOLIE
(VO cont)
Everybody played this ghetto
version of Jin Rummy called ‘Tunk’

They all wear Addidas flip flops with socks and name brand
sweatpants (Hillfiger Nautica Polo etc) Some of the kids
have on athletic shorts on under their sweatpants
In the background Jolie has a gray ratty hoody on and is
hunched over and old PC computer with Arius a beer-bellied
balding black dude who is smoking a cigarette and has no
shirt on

WENDEL
Jolie you want in

Everyone else other than Jolie is also shirtless The kids
have exquisite ABS the kind you see on television

JOLIE
Naw I gotta see this

ARIUS
Ok Here it goes

Close on
An arrow clicks on the play button but the image stays
frozen a low res picture of a bare ass black man mounted

miliary style on a black girl

The image moves for a brief moment We hear a grown with half
a thrust and the image freezes again

Then it reverts to the beginning image

JOLIE
Wow

ARIUS
Yeah This is the future right
here

JOLIE
Why wont it go play or whatever

ARIUS
Bandwidth

JOLIE
(confused)
Oh yea
Jolie tokes a blunt
Arius takes a last puff and puts it out

A little cute six year old girl comes out of the bedroom with
a sheet of paper and pencil
CUTE GIRL
Arius Who was the first president
of the United States

ARIUS
Uh George Washington

She runs back into the bedroom

ARIUS
So That’s what it’s all about I’m
a capital venturist man Internet
porn is the future of sexual
healing Henrietta was just the
first of many It’s big business
Dollar bills man

Jolie looks on stoned Not sure what to make of it all

EXT THE BELTWAY - DAWN
A six lane highway banks a sharp curve Its raining lightly

On the shoulder of the highway are kids from the Blair
Basketball team picking up trash with pokers They are spread
out - a kid every 25 yards or so - and together they extend
clear around the curve and out of sight

Jolie pokes a Coke can

Jolie plucks the can off the end metal nail and realizes he
also stabbed the tape liner notes of MC Hammers Please
Hammer Dont Hurtem There is a picture of Hammer on the
cover

The coach sits in a nearby van with its lights on parked in
the shoulder He sips hot coffee watching

Jolie looks closely at the tape insert

It’s a picture of Hammer but someone has scratched out his
eyes with a pen And the poker has put a hole through his
face

JOLIE

(voice over)
I wasn’t sure what to make of it
all Why Henrietta’s parents never
know she was pregant until too
late Or why I never said something
myself It was like none of it
really mattered or was even real
at all until it was too late
CLOSE ON An old PC monitor A picture slowly emerging from a
blurry pixilated square of colors

JOLIE

(voice over)
After that I used the internet to
find a bunch of places that would
take Henriettas baby up for
adoption It wasn’t easy but I
found all the information right
from Haroons basement using
Netscape

The picture of a couple materializes hopeful parents and
their profile

INT HAROONS SECOND HOME - DAY

HAROON

EXT HAROONS BACKYARD - DAY

Haroons brothers have set up a trampoline to dunk on an
adjustable rim lowered to 8 ft

Haroon sit on the side
JOLIE
(bummed)

HENRIETTA

JOLIE

HENRIETTA
Jolie Thank you
(smells it)
It smells like you Someday little
Benny will wear it That’s what
I’ve decided to name him Benny

JOLIE
Oh Wow Well Uh before you name
him I was kinda thinking maybe we
could discuss uh

HENRIETTA
What

JOLIE
Well
(Jolie sits next to her)
(MORE)
JOLIE (contd)
I was also thinking maybe we could
talk about the possibility of you
giving up your baby for adoption

HENRIETTA
Jolie How could you even say that
I’ve wanted a family of my own a
real family since as long as I can
remember There is no way I could
ever give little Benny away Ever
In a million years Do you
understand that

JOLIE
Well Yeah I guess so But at the
same time it just doesn’t seem
like the smartest thing I’ve
already found a really wealthy
well educated good meaning couple
whod like to meet up with you
about it

HENRIETTA
Never No way Jolie End of
discussion

JOLIE
Don’t you even want to think it
over for a few days I mean look
how lucky your parents are to have
you You’d be making some couple
just as happy And your child would
have more opportunities I mean
you’re still in High School know
what I mean

HENRIETTA
Jolie I can’t even believe you’re
suggesting that Dont you see how
racist that is

JOLIE
What

Jolie is silent
HENRIETTA
Now do something to cheer me up I
am totally offended you wanted to
give away my baby

Jolie sits in silence for a moment pondering his situation

He stands up and heads to the door demoralized
Then he turns and looks at Henrietta on the bed
Jolie looks at her bulging belly much of it exposed
