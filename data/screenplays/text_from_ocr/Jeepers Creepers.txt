EXT LONELY COUNTRY ROAD DAY

An empty ribbon of asphalt Winding through an endless
stretch of meadows and farmlands For a long moment silence
Then a distant speck A car moving toward us

A SOUND APPROACHING WITH IT NOW A RADIO BLARING AND TWO
RAISED VOICES SINGING WITH IT

TRISHA JAMES is a beautiful girl of twenty Hair blowing in
the breeze of the open passenger window She sings out
banging the side of the car with her hand Keeping the beat
of the boisterous rock song

She sings with younger brother DARRY Nineteen Attractive
like his sister Lighter hair Softer looking Striking eyes
Voice raised as they speed along Trying to swallow up the
road as quickly as possible

The backseat has a couple of suitcases and a large basket
wrapped in a garbage bag The song comes to an end as Darry
flies through an abandoned intersection

TRISH
That was a stop sign

DARRY
Youre kidding right

TRISH
In your car Id be kidding

DARRY
You think were actually gonna
run into anyone else on this
road Relax
(turns the radio louder
shouts over it)
Enjoy the countryside

The ANGRY MUSIC WAILING and the car blasting down the
tranquil road We watch as it heads for what seems like
infinity

EXT LONELY COUNTRY ROAD DAY SOME TIME LATER

DARRY
Okay here comes

Trish and Darry slowing down now Coming up on a
campertrailer Brother and sister stare at the license
plate
JEEPERS CREEPERS 2

DARRY

ing me at this game

TRISH

Darry guns the engine Goes into the oncoming lane to pass
the campertrailer

TRISH (cont’d)
Come on Darry

They pass the cab of the truck An OLD MAN of sixty behind
the wheel His WIFE next to him He glares down at Trish and
Darry as they pass him

DARRY
Sexy forever huh

TRISH
You know that is you in forty
years

DARRY

Note to self Die young
(checks his rearview)

Any place but here on this

unbelievably endless road
JEEPERS CREEPERS 3

TRISH
You wanna be sucking in
exhaust fumes on the
Interstate

DARRY
No I love stopping at train
tracks every ten minutes

No further comment from big sister Shes suddenly some place

else

DARRY (cont’d)
You know theres usually a
reason when you like the long
way home

TRISH
Gee like maybe I like the
country

DARRY
(mocking sincerity)
Okay

TRISH
Just drive brat

DARRY
Im only thinking the same
thing mom and dad are gonna be
thinking how come youre
driving home for Spring break
with baby brother

Not heading off somewhere with
Mr Poly-Sci-Track-Team-Guy

TRISH
And Ill tell you what Id
tell them none of your
Goddamned business-

WOOOONNNNKKKKKK A DARK VAN HAS SUDDENLY LURCHED BEHIND
THEM BLARING ITS HORN

DARRY
(swerves a little)
Jesus

The van is tailgating them at an alarming velocity Rattling
and shimmying it is so old and distressed
JEEPERS CREEPERS 4

TRISH
Darry

DARRY
Whats this guy trying to do

He tries to find the driver in the rearview The Vans
windshield is heavily tinted

TRISH
Just get out of his way

DARRY
Hes nuts

TRISH
(emphatically)
Get out of his way Darry

Darry swerves into the oncoming lane and the van tears
forward Blasting toward the distant horizon

Both brother and sister watch breathless Catching its
rusting and personalized license plate

BEATNGU
TRISH (cont’d)
Jesus
DARRY
(back in the right lane)
Shit

TRISH
What the Hell is his problem

DARRY
My first guess inbreeding

He has shouted this last word out the window toward the
distant van

DARRY (cont’d)
Get a load of that thing
Vehicle of choice for five out
of ten serial killers

Brother and sister still trying to catch their breath as the
van disappears over a distant rise

TRISH
God you know what I just
thought of right
JEEPERS CREEPERS

DARRY
Kenny and Darla
(off Trishs nod)
They died about a hundred
miles from here

TRISH
It was the same highway

DARRY
This highway runs the length
of the State

TRISH
You think it really happened

DARRY
That they had to go looking
for her head

TRISH
No that they never found her
Or him They only found the
car

DARRY
No they never found her head
They found the car but they
couldnt find him or her head

TRISH
Look at me
(holds out her hand)
Im still shaking

DARRY
You dont think every
generation has their
cautionary tale of drinking
and driving on Prom Night

TRISH
I always heard it was real
That they were Class of 80

After I heard that story I
used to think this was the
highway I would die on

DARRY
Quite the cheery thinker
today What did Poly-sci guy
do to you anyway
JEEPERS CREEPERS 6

She isnt listening Thoughts elsewhere again

DARRY (cont’d)

Beating you

(off her look)
That was the license plate on
the van B-E-A-T-N-G-U

(turns to her)
Beating you thats five to
five That ties us up

TRISH
You cant call it now
DARRY
My ass
TRISH
You have to call it when you
see it
DARRY

I was in shock
THE JANGLING BELLS OF A RAILROAD CROSSING AHEAD

DARRY (cont’d)
You know I dont remember
there being so many rules to
this game

Trish and Darry slowing as the bells ring and the bars lower

DARRY (cont’d)
Course when there was you
were the one making ‘em
Little Miss Junior Nazi with
the Barbie Doll and the Easy
Bake Oven

Darry looks down the tracks Sees the small cargo train
approaching Revs the engine

TRISH
Dont you dare
(off his look)
My car

Trish sniffs Smells something Looks in the backseat The
big thing covered in a trash bag She lifts the plastic a
full laundry basket
JEEPERS CREEPERS 7

TRISH (cont’d)
You are a class act you know
that

DARRY

Hey you live off campus

(she just stares at him)
You ever try and do laundry in
a dorm What they dont steal
they dye pink for you Ive
got twelve pair of rosey-pink
jockey shorts

TRISH
Maybe they know something
about you you dont

She takes the Deodorizer hanging off the rearview mirror and
stuffs it in the bag

TRISH (cont’d)
Hi mom havent seen you
forever heres my dirty
shorts

The train is upon them now He shouts over the din

DARRY
Its for her not me I have to
bring home laundry I dont
she gets depressed Like she
thinks I dont need her
anymore or something

Trishs look says she isnt buying it The SHORT TRAIN ROARS
PAST Leaves the car waiting for bells to stop and the bars
to rise

TRISH
You talk to her lately
DARRY
To tell her Id be home for
break
TRISH

She sound like anything was
going on

Darry throws her a look
TRISH

(impatient)
Did you listen to her voice
JEEPERS CREEPERS 8

DARRY
Specify please

TRISH

I think maybe somethings
wrong

(off his look)
I dont think theyre telling
us

(off his continued look)
Like you would notice anything
past the point of your own
selfish little existence

The bars go up and the car flies over the tracks Continues
its trek down the two-lane

DARRY
If mom and dad were gonna get
a divorce dont you think
theyd have done it by now

TRISH
No I think they wouldve
waited till we were both grown
and off at school

DARRY
Whatever

TRISH
Shes not happy Not even a
little bit Not like she used

to be
DARRY
Who is
(spots something)
Hey

They are driving past an old abandoned church set back from
the road

DARRY (cont’d)
You see it

Her sister peers past him In the churchs side yard the old
van is parked The one that almost ran them off the road

DARRY (cont’d)
Its Beating You

TRISH
Whats he doing
JEEPERS CREEPERS 9

But what they both see now is something much more ominous

A tall dark figure dropping something large and oblong down
an old drainage pipe in the back of the church

DARRY
What the Hell is that

The oblong object is gone in an instant Swallowed up by the
large mouth of the old protruding pipe

The kids view blocked now by the church

TRISH
Dont slow down
DARRY
You think he saw us
TRISH
What the Hell was he doing
DARRY
He dumped something down that
pipe
TRISH

Wrapped in a sheet

DARRY
Wrapped and roped in a sheet

TRISH
Wrapped and roped in a sheet
with red stains on it
Both of them study the rearview mirror now
TRISH (cont’d)
Vehicle of choice for five out
of ten what

Darry guns the engine

DARRY
I dont think he saw us

TRISH
Dont get us killed

DARRY
You see him

Both watch the old church get smaller in their view
JEEPERS CREEPERS 10

TRISH
Nope

Someone appears high on the old roof Standing next to the
sagging steeple

DARRY
What the-

Appears so suddenly it could almost be the Figure had leapt
up there

Darry stares at this perplexed

DARRY (cont’d)
You see that

She hasnt Just the distant figure on the roof looking
after them Some kind of long coat flapping in the wind like
a cape

TRISH
Just get us out of here Darry

The figure drops from view as quickly as he appeared

A glance between brother and sister and Darry increases speed

DARRY
Grab my cell phone

TRISH
Where

DARRY

In the gym bag

Trish starts rummaging Finds the cell phone Flips it open
Powers it up Staring back at the church

THE PHONE GIVES OUT A LOW BATTERY ALERT

TRISH
The point of having a portable
phone idiot is so that it
works when you need it

DARRY
I have a power cable for it

TRISH
(stuffs the phone back in
the bag)

(MORE )
JEEPERS CREEPERS 11

TRISH (contd)
And I have a cigarette lighter
that doesnt work

DARRY
I told you we shoulda’ taken
my car

Trish pales Staring out the back

In the distance the dark van is now leaving the old church
and taking the road again

TRISH
Oh Jesus

Heading toward them

DARRY
(in the rearview)
You gotta be kidding me

THEY CAN HEAR THE VANS DISTANT ENGINE BEING GUNNED

Darry floors it the little car ripping down the highway as
the old van swoops after it -looking like a dark bird of
prey

Darry staring down at the speedometer Hes up to ninety and
the little car is starting to shake

Darry checks the rearview mirror The van still gaining

DARRY
What the Hells he got in that
thing Hes got it suped up or
something-

The car speeds down the two lane trying desperately to keep distance
but the van continues to gain -SCREAMING TOWARD THEM

TRISH
Darry Hes right on our
ass

DARRY

I can see him

The van is only a few yards from them now Darrys foot
slamming the pedal to the metal

He and she staring back at the vans tinted windshield
Glints in the sun No driver can be seen
JEEPERS CREEPERS 12

DARRY (cont’d)
Hang on-

TRISH
Darry-

DARRY
Im gonna try something

TRISH
Darry dont kill us

He is staring up ahead at a gravel road that shoots sharply
off the highway

Just as the van lurches up to their rear bumper -its dark
face and grill filling the rear and sideview mirrors

TRISH (cont’d)
Darry whatre you doing

DARRY
Jesus Christ-

BAM THE VAN SLAMS THE BACK OF THE CAR

At its top speed the car shimmies and shakes Darry weaves
in and out of the oncoming lane several times before
regaining control

DARRY (cont’d)
I dont believe this-

WOOOONNNNKKKKKK THE HORN FROM THE VAN BLARES -but it is
a sound they have never heard come from an auto before

This could almost be the deep guttural sound of a wailing
beast

TRISH
What the Hell does he want
(screaming out the back)
Are you out of your fucking
mind

WHAM The van hits the back of the sedan again

DARRY
Christ

Darry almost in tears Trying desperately to control the car
as it crosses the oncoming lane and roughly lurches onto the
dirt shoulder
JEEPERS CREEPERS 13

The sedan shakes violently as Darry tries to get it back onto
asphalt again

His sister screams -a big ditch dead ahead Darry grapples
the wheel and as the sedan spits up dirt he swings the car
back onto asphalt again

The van tails them across the oncoming lane and back across
the highway

WOOOONNNKKKKK THE STRANGE BRUTAL HORN WAILS AGAIN

Darry is almost up to the gravel road that shoots off the two
lane

DARRY (cont’d)
Hang on

Trish just stares at her brother The boy is shaken Eyes
full of fear She looks back at the van It is charging ahead
at them again

TRISH
What the fuck is the matter

WHAMM Struck again from behind -Darry really loses
control Tries to swing onto the gravel roadway -but leaves
the two lane at a terrifying speed unable to negotiate the
Sharp turn

Blasting through a wooden fence and into an open field
Darry slams on his brakes as they rocket into tall grass

The windshield is whipped with grass as the cars brakes lock
up and the vehicle continues to fly forward

A cloud of birds flutters out of the deep grass in front of
them as inside the car brother and sister are tossed around
like ragdolls

Trish trying desperately to fasten her seatbelt Darry just
leaning into that brake

TRISH (cont’d)
Goddammitt

The car swings around and stops Jostling to a halt in some
even taller grass and bringing a sudden and eerie silence

Only the breathing of brother and sister can be heard inside
the car
JEEPERS CREEPERS 14

That and the sound of the vans engine pounding away in the
distance

Out Trishs dirtied window she can see the highway through
the grass She and Darry stare out

The old van is not even slowing Continuing at its terrifying
speed down the two lane

Brother and sister staring after it Breathless as it
disappears in the distance

They look at each other Both seem to be intact Without a
word Darry opens the car door In some kind of shock Takes
a step out

ANOTHER GAGGLE OF BIRDS SUDDENLY FLAPPING THEIR WINGS
Blasting out from deep grass beyond Darry Scares the shit
out of him

DARRY
You fuckers

Picks up a rock Throws it at their ascending cloud Needs to
take out his anger and frustration Picks up another one
Looks over at his sister

Trish is standing now staring out at the highway The van
long gone

DARRY (cont’d)
Still like the country

She turns and looks at him

DARRY (cont’d)
The next time Poly-Sci guy
pisses you off Im gonna kick
his fucking ass

Trish just looks at the car surrounded by the tall grass

EXT GRAVEL ROAD DAY MINUTES LATER

Dirtied and scraped the small car emerges slowly from the
tall grass Trish behind the wheel now Darry looking out the
passenger window

They back out of the field Through the opening in the wooden
fence that they made going in Roll the car onto the gravel
drive
JEEPERS CREEPERS

Pointed again toward the highway Trish guns the engine but
doesnt move Looks to her brother

DARRY
Sounds alright I guess

TRISH
Like either of us would know

DARRY
(defending his manhood)
I know a little

TRISH
When your car makes a strange
noise you just buy a new tape
Darry thats what you told
me

DARRY
Told you I learned it from
you

TRISH
Asshole

DARRY
Bitch

TRISH
Mamas boy

DARRY
Daddys whore

TRISH
Dick Licker

DARRY
Ball sniffer

TRISH
Ass kisser

DARRY

Butt picker

TRISH
Hah Repeat Ass and butt You
lose

Looks over at Trish and smiles She too They need a smile

about now
JEEPERS CREEPERS 16

Trish rolls to the end of the gravel drive Stops at the
highway Looks both ways Darrys hand on the wheel suddenly

DARRY
Im thinking past the point of
my own selfish little
existence now okay

What if that really was a
person he dumped down that
pipe What if it was someone
still alive

Trish just stares at her brother

DARRY (cont’d)
Someone who needs help but
doesnt get it Or doesnt get
it till its too late

TRISH
We can get help just as fast
by getting to a phone-

DARRY
You know how far we are from
the nearest pay phone

TRISH
Is this your idea of an
adventure or something ‘Cause
this is why girls are smarter
okay

DARRY
Hey we almost got killed You
dont wanna even find out
why

She isnt wanting or liking this

DARRY (cont’d)

We look in the pipe Thats
all we do

(off her look)
We look in the pipe and if
theres nothing there or
nothing we can do we just
drive on home and call the
cops

Trish stares unwilling
JEEPERS CREEPERS 17

DARRY (cont’d)
You know Im right

TRISH
Bullshit I do

DARRY
Look me straight in the eye
and tell me Im not right

She wont look at him He knows he has her now

DARRY (cont’d)
Come on right in the eye

She turns and glares at him as she throws the car in gear

TRISH
Im not getting out of the
car

Darry smiles Trish heads out onto the highway Back toward
the old church

EXT OLD CHURCH LATE DAY MINUTES LATER

The car stops on the empty two-lane just before the old
church Darry and Trish regard it Check the rearview too
Empty road Empty church yard

TRISH
Every bone in my body is
telling me not to do this

DARRY
Where would men be if they
spent their lives listening to
womens bodies

She gives him a look Rolls into the drive The old church is
sagging and gray and has not been a place of worship in many
years

They drive around the side Both staring up at the old
steeple And the THREE BLACK CROWS perched on the cross where
one arm has rotted off

The back of the place is covered in soil No parking lot
Just moist dirt and leaves Mulch And ahead through the
windshield the large drain pipe sticking out of the ground

Trish drives slowly toward it Stops a few yards away Looks
at her brother Suddenly Darry doesnt look so brave either
JEEPERS CREEPERS 18

DARRY
Im just gonna look

TRISH
You look like youre gonna
puke

Darry opens the car door Gets out Looks out to the highway
Then the surrounding woods in back of the church No one

Moves toward the old pipe when the sound of his sister turns
his head

TRISH
Lets do this and do it fast

They approach the pipe warily It is corrugated metal and
sticks out of the ground about three feet Angled into the
ground its jagged metal mouth is about three feet wide

DARRY
Drainage pipe or something

Trish and Darry stare down the dark tunnel A breeze comes
out of it And a terrible stench

TRISH
Oh my God

She covers her mouth and stares at her brother

DARRY
That breeze has to come from
somewhere

TRISH
Somewhere rank

DARRY
Doesnt look like a sewer
pipe

TRISH

Come on Darry We cant see
anything down there

DARRY
(nods to the car)
You gotta flashlight

She throws him a cold look Moves back to the car Darry
stares down into the pitch
JEEPERS CREEPERS 19

DARRY
Hello

Listens to his echo

DARRY
Anybody down there

Again his voice rebounding Looks back toward the car when
the smallest of sounds drifts up the pipe

Darry whirls back to it Stares in SOMEWHERE DOWN IN THE
DARK A MURMUR A SOFT MUFFLED HUMAN SOUND

DARRY
Hello
(to Trish)
Hurry up

Trish brings the flashlight Darry grabs it out of her hand
Shines it down the long length of metal

DARRY
Hello

(off her look)
Theres someone down there
I just heard them

(again into the dark)
Hello

The light reveals dark earth at the bottom of the pipe Some
twenty-five feet down

TRISH
Youre hearing things

Darry tests the strength of the pipe It is anchored solidly
in the ground

TRISH
Darry dont even think about
it

He hoists himself up into the mouth

DARRY
I told you I heard someone

Crouched inside the pipe he stares down Holds the
flashlight with one hand and the lip of the tube with the
other
JEEPERS CREEPERS 20

TRISH
You know the part in scary
movies where somebody does
something really stupid and
everybody hates them for it
(off his look)
This is it

A small scuffling sound from below

Trish hears this Darry stares down the tunnel raking the
darkness with the flashlight Looks back at her His
expression asks her Did you hear that

Now worming his way further into the opening of the tunnel

TRISH
No Darry

DARRY
Let me slide down-

TRISH
Goddamnitt

DARRY
Just let me get a little way
in-

TRISH

Youre not going down there

DARRY
Im not Just hold my feet

As he lays down inside the tube flashlight extended Trish
grabs her brothers ankles

DARRY
Anybody down there

TRISH
God when was the last time you
washed any socks

DARRY
I see something

He strains to look back at her Trish too scared to comment
DARRY

(shouts down again)
Hello
JEEPERS CREEPERS 21

TRISH
Im counting to ten Darry

DARRY
Somethings moving down
there

TRISH

Then I am letting go and going
back to my car-

DARRY
Quiet
(peers forward)
I just saw it again Something
is definitely moving down here-

Moving alright -directly into Darrys flashlight beam TWO
TERRIFIED RATS -darting directly at him

DARRY
Abhhhh

TRISH
Darry

DARRY
Rats

The rodents run right up over his shoulders He screams
Thrashes They scurry onto his back Rushing up

TRISH
(trying to keep hold of his
kicking feet)
Its what

DARRY
Its rats

But he doesnt need to tell her The rats run right at her
now One down each of Darrys legs

Trish screams -releasing her brothers still thrashing feet
Its a tie who screams louder Trisha stumbling back as the
rats leap to the ground -or brother Darry as he slides all

the way down the large pipe

A GREAT THUD BELOW Trish charges toward the pipe as the
rodents scurry into the leaves

TRISH
Darry
JEEPERS CREEPERS 22

Her voice echoes into darkness as she stares down

TRISH
Darry

DARRY
Owww Fell right on my head

INT SUBTERRANEAN ROOM CHURCH LATE DAY SAME TIME

Darry rubs his neck Winces in the dark Rust and dust
trickle down from the pipe He sits in the dim pool of
daylight from above Squints up into it

DARRY
Whyd you let go

TRISH
How the Hellre you gonna get
out of there idiot

Darry stands slowly Looks up the drain pipe
DARRY
I can climb out relax your

crack

He bends and gropes for the flashlight outside the circle of
light Finds it Switches it on

The first thing the light hits is the edge of something
wrapped in a bloody sheet

Darry stops This is what they saw being dumped down the
tube

TRISH
Darry

Brother doesnt answer Takes a terrified step toward it

TRISH
Do it then climb out please

There can be no question it is a body Blood stains on the
head and midsection Sheet around it Tied with rope at the
neck and ankles

DARRY
Say not so sis
JEEPERS CREEPERS 23

TRISH
(peering down)
What

DARRY
(to himself now)
Say not so

He bends to it Studies the head as he pales

DARRY
Hello

Feels like an idiot talking to it But does anyway

DARRY
Did I hear you down here

No response Swallows Has no choice but to touch it Gently
on the arm Pushes it Testing it

TRISH
Darry what in the Holy Hell
are you doing down there

DARRY
I found our body

TRISH
You found what

Darry still staring at Paling

DARRY
I found the body

Darry starts to get up Grabbed By a hand
DARRY WAILS Lurches away from it stumbling back The body

is moving under its bloody sheet Twitching Trying to
breathe

DARRY
Oh God

TRISH
Darry

DARRY
Oh God

Darry dashes toward it Crashes to his knees Starts tearing
at the sheet around its head
JEEPERS CREEPERS 24

The sheet being sucked in and out around the mouth now It is
gasping for air

Darry trying to tear the sheet To get a grip on it The body
thrashes

stares down in shock

It is A YOUNG MAN About his age Deathly gray Mouth open in
mute agony Eyes wide Blinking up at him

Darry can only stare in terror He doesnt know what to do

Frantically grabs the sheet Tears it the rest of the way
down the body -stopping abruptly

The young mans bare body has an incision of ugly black
stitches --all the way from the navel to the neck

Darry thinks he might be sick Looks up into those wide eyes
What in Gods name did someone do to you

Both boys stare at each other helplessly

TRISH
Darry

DARRY
(can whisper back)
Trish

The boys dry blue lips are opening The Adams apple bobs
as he tries to swallow Darry crazy with fear leans down
His ear at the boys lips as they part again

DARRY
What

A whispered word comes out of his mouth Choked Raspy
Unintelligible

DARRY
What did you say

But no more sound comes Nor breathing Darry staring wide-
eyed Almost catatonic Backs off him Slowly

TRISH
I am up here all Goddamned
alone little brother Now get
your ass up here it is
getting dark
JEEPERS CREEPERS 25

Her angry voice echoes down Darry moves to the puddle of
light and looks up at her

TRISH
Is she dead

DARRY
He

TRISH
Come on before that guy comes
back

Darry nods Goes to hoist a foot up into the tube but stops
His flashlight has swept over something else outside the aura
of daylight

He throws the light along the damp earth past the lifeless
body of the boy and over to

Two more bloody sheet-wrapped bodies Piled on top of each
other

Darry in shock Stares numbly at them Swallows Starts to shake
his head no Cannot accept this Will not accept this

Darry charging now back toward the pool of daylight

EXT OLD CHURCH LATE DAY SAME TIME

Above Trish sees him hoist himself into the tube and start a
furious frightened climb toward daylight

DARRY
Darry

A climb so violent the pipe rocks and shimmies Rivulets of
soot and rust trickling down the metal surface

TRISH
Whats the matter

But little brother isnt answering Just clamoring
desperately to get back up top and away from this place
forever

Halfway up he slips THE PIPE GROANS as he tries to get new
footing

TRISH
Be careful
JEEPERS CREEPERS 26

He looks up at her His face is dirty and his eyes wide with
child-like horror

TRISH
This whole thing is moving

He catches his breath still staring up at her
TRISH
Say something Darry youre
scaring the shit out of me

Darry starts up again His sister reaching down toward him

Slow crane up moving above the pipe and above the church
High enough to look down the lonely two-lane

And see a van headed toward them in the distance

Darry reaches up for his sisters hand as the PIPE SHRIEKS
AGAIN More soot dislodging Running past him

TRISH
Shhh

She hears THE APPROACHING ENGINE Looks down at little brother

TRISH
Someones coming
(off his look)
Someones coming

In a new panic he grabs Trishs hand With a concerted effort
big sis pulls little brother up to the mouth of the pipe

TRISH
(trying to look behind her)
Hurry
WRRANNKKKKK The pipe makes A NEW SHRILLER KIND OF

SOUND and Darry can feel the entire thing shift

Really clutching his sisters hand now Grabs the lip of the
pipe with the other But a piece of its jagged torn metal
stabs into his palm

He yells Retracts his hand violently Loses his footing
Slides out of Trishs grip Down he goes again Thrashing all
the way

TRISH
Darry
JEEPERS CREEPERS 27

Gets his footing halfway down Examines the gash in his hand
when PING PING Just beneath his sneakers the rusty welds
holding the lengths of the pipe together -snap

Darry in the middle of the tube Staring up at his sister
with wide eyes AS A LOW ACHING METAL GROAN BEGINS BUILDING
QUICKLY

Darry scrambling up toward the mouth as he realizes what is
about to happen

Almost to the top when the bottom half of the massive tube
falls away Darry sliding down again with the great jolt
Both he and the pipe plummeting down into the darkness in a
great cacophony of sound and dust

TRISH
Darrrrry

Tries to see through the cloud of dust that shoots up out of
the tube AS THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING VAN GETS LOUDER

She whirls toward the highway Dashes toward her car Huddles
in front of it Peers around the left front wheel Her heart
racing

The van comes into view

But not a dark van This is another newer van And it
continues down the two-lane without ever stopping

INT SUBTERRANEAN ROOM CHURCH DUSK MOMENTS LATER

Darry sitting on the ground against the fallen half of the
pipe staring at the gash in his hand Stares up with Trishs
voice

TRISH
It wasnt him

DARRY
You know you really suck
(stands holding his arm)
In the moment of truth you
really dont know how to hang
on do you You just suck-

TRISH
You were the one who wanted to
come back here and have a
little adventure
JEEPERS CREEPERS 28

Darry is staring over at the bodies The two still in sheets
He stares up at his sister again

TRISH
Well I hope theres another
way outta there

DARRY
(angry)
Well its a church basement so
Im guessing the church

The sagging old church Especially forboding as she regards it

TRISH
You dont think Im going in
there

DARRY

You have to stay out front and
watch for people

(off her look)
You see anyone Flag ‘em down
Tell ‘em to get the cops out
here right away

Trish liking this less and less

DARRY
Im gonna find a way up

He starts to move off but calls her again

DARRY
Trish
(off her look)
You see that van coming you
get back to this pipe and
holler down as loud as you
can

Now she couldnt like the whole idea less Darry staring at
those bodies again

DARRY
I gotta find the flashlight

Trish hurries to the car Keeping an eye on the old highway
She gets in Starts the engine
JEEPERS CREEPERS 29

INT SUBTERRANEAN ROOM LATE DAY SAME TIME

Darry takes the flashlight out from under the fallen length
of pipe Tries it It still works

Letting his light lead him he moves forward
Ahead the other two bodies Piled together These
bloodstains are darker Browner How long have they been down

here

Darry draws in a breath The smell is getting putrid

In the same moment his light ascends There are words over
his head An epitaph spelled out in bones

WHERE THERES A HELL THERES A
WAY

Darry really gets a chill now Doesnt want to wonder if
those are human bones Arranged as they are on a high arch
that leads into a larger darker subterranean room

Where a hand is sticking out of the wall

His light falls over it The skin on its splayed fingers
looks petrified Is this a human hand

No question The rest of the body is part of the wall

Skin leathered with age Like beef jerky Teeth infected with
termites Head back mouth open in a scream long gone
silent A body in a wall

But more light reveals more horror A WALL of bodies

DARRY
Oh no oh God

Darry steps forward knees shaking The vast room ahead is
walled with dozens of these mounted corpses

Men and women of all ages Body after body

Stitched together in a hideous tapestry Large stitches
Identical to those just uncovered beneath that bloody sheet
JEEPERS CREEPERS 30

Darry swings the light to the other side of the chamber
Another grotesque mural of the dead extending deep into the
darkness ahead

God how many bodies are down here

Darry moves forward -drawn by his own need to prove none of
this can possibly be real

Some bodies are turned away Skeletal heads looking back over
their shoulders -petrified backsides showing more stitches

Several are as armless as the Venus DeMilo Some missing
other limbs Heads Feet Genitals

Darrys growing repulsion moves him faster -how big is this
room Feels like a football field

Deeper along the hideous walls Darry turns abruptly Two
withered corpses in the tapestry

On the finger of one a large ring An old Varsity ring His
beam reflecting off its dusty jeweled surface Darry stares
at it with unquestionable recognition

Looks slowly to the corpse beside it A girl Once Her
incision is all around her neck As if her head had been
severed and then sewn back on

EXT OLD CHURCH DUSK SAME TIME

Trish parked at the corner of the old church Keeping an eye
on both directions of the empty two lane Watching the long
shadows as the sun drops

Feels something creeping over her Looks up

The sun is dropping behind the steeple of the church the
shadow of the tower slowly falling on her

She sits anxious in its growing darkness

INT SUBTERRANEAN ROOM CHURCH DUSK SAME TIME

The same below Darry staring back at the distant archway and
the dying sunlight

Looks ahead at the cavern of the dead The ambient light
fading away over all those twisted faces this place is
getting really dark
JEEPERS CREEPERS 31

Darry takes a breath and moves forward quickly Not quite
running The darkness wont allow this But walking as
quickly as he ever has

The deeper he gets the fresher the bodies

They no longer have the withered faces and skins like apple
dolls They have been a part of the walls for less time

Darry moves faster Almost running

Grimacing faces of the dead gaping mouths of mute agony
shouting him on

Now practically sprinting through this corridor of death
Tries to keep his eyes straight ahead Doesnt want to look
at them Tries not to

Steals a look to one side Looks back and WHAMMM Runs
directly into someone reaching out for him

Darry has fallen and screams Backs up on all fours Stops
The figure reaching out is just another corpse on a new wall
in front of him He has finally arrived at the end of this
horrible room

Between this corpse and another Darry can see hinges

DARRY
Youre fucking kidding me

This withered corpse with his outstretched hand is a door

He looks at the hand The handle This is what I have to pull
to get out of here

He swallows draws a breath and reaches out Avoids the
leathery fingers and takes the forearm Gets his grip

Pulls The door doesnt move Darry cant believe what hes
doing Gets a tighter grip and pulls again Hard

This door hasnt been opened in years

Reaches out again -when the corpses head turns toward
him with its empty eyes and gaping mouth

Darry leaps away Staring terrified

But the head has only been jarred loose It falls now right
off the neck Hangs by a leathery strand of flesh
JEEPERS CREEPERS 32

This is enough Darry reaches out Yanks with all his might
on the forearm of the headless man and in a terrible frenzy
dislodges the door

It comes off its hinges and topples toward Darry -corpse and
all

The door is heavy and it hits hard -but not as hard as Darry
hits the ground

The corpse falling on top of him -the head still attached by
some brittle tendon nuzzles into his shoulder

Darry doesnt have time to scream -he throws the door off him
and scrambles forward through the dark open doorway and up
some dusty steps beyond

Climbing and screaming Screaming and climbing And climbing
some more

EXT OLD CHURCH NIGHT MOMENTS LATER

Down the highway two headlights appear

Trish instantly afraid Stares down at them Could this be
him

Trish looks at the church Where the Hell is he

The headlights closer now The vehicle is big The van

She is suddenly unreasonable with panic Doesnt know what to
do --The lights of the oncoming vehicle starting to show on
her face

She ducks Below the dashboard Can hear THE ENGINE HEAVY
LIKE THE VAN Lights spilling across the dash now She
reaches up from below Turns the key

The engine wont turn over

Lights really bright now Almost upon her Turns the key
again Goddamn thing wont start

Trishs eyes starting to well Light filling the interior of
the car The engine finally sparks She is ready

But the lights are passing now And she peeks over the dash
at nothing but an old pick up continuing on down the highway

Trish sits up- SCREAMS SOMEONE AT HER WINDOW STARING IN
DARK FACE WIDE EYES ETCHED IN THE DYING LIGHT OF THE PASSING
TRUCK
JEEPERS CREEPERS 33

Darry Almost comatose staring in at her

TRISH
Goddammit Darry

He just stares

TRISH
You asshole

Sees that something is very wrong Little brother just
staring back

EXT LONELY COUNTRY ROAD NIGHT MINUTES LATER

Trish drives in silence The highway rushing past them Keeps
throwing looks at her brother Still as a statue Face dirty
Bloody hand wrapped in a piece of torn T shirt Eyes staring
ahead

Oncoming headlights now Both brother and sister study them
Another truck It rushes past

A sign up ahead
TRENTDALE 25 Miles
She watches it fly by Looks to him again

TRISH
Would you please just say
something
(no response)
I mean it Darry youre
scaring the shit out of me

His voice as subdued as she has ever heard it

DARRY
I saw em Trish Kenny and
Darla Class of 80

She just stares

DARRY
They were down there both of
them
(holds up a hand not
looking at her)
I saw his ring He was still
wearing his Varsity ring
JEEPERS CREEPERS 34

TRISH
You said that happened a
hundred miles from here-

DARRY
I said I saw ‘em
(angry silence)
All dead and dried up down
there with a whole bunch of
others okay

She more frightened by his state than by his words

DARRY (cont’d)

Dont tell me you dont
believe me alright

(points a rabid finger at

her)
Dont make me tell you
everything I saw down there
cause you dont wanna hear
it okay

Her brothers eyes fill with angry tears Then goes silent
again Drops his head against the window

Trish looks at the fuel indicator Only a quarter of a tank
left

DARRY (cont’d)
She did lose her head

Looks over at her brother Staring out the window into the
passing night

DARRY
Darla lost her head just like
they said
(off her look)
And you know what he did
Trish You know what he did
for her He sewed it back on

Darry lets out a little laugh Is he going crazy
DARRY
Sewed it right back on
EXT TRENTDALE NIGHT TEN MINUTES LATER
Trishs sedan rambles off the two-lane and toward a small

cluster of buildings under the starry night sky Past a
weathered and aging sign that reads
JEEPERS CREEPERS 35

7)

Welcome to TRENTIDALE Population 517
Brother and sister look to each other Neither wants to stop

TRISH
We have to or were not gonna
make it home

She continues on toward the only lights Combination
Restaurant and Gas Station The tall sign stretching into the
stars announces plainly

Trish pulls in Rolls under the hot white neon over the gas
pumps Looks over at little brother

TRISH
You gonna make a phone call

Darry just nods Opens the car door

TRISH
Throw some water on yourself
You look like you just crawled
out of a sewer

Darry moves with fatigue toward the restaurant Several cars
and big trucks parked around it

Trish moves to the pump There is a pad lock on it She grabs
it Yanks on it Turns to her brother

TRISH
Darry
(off his look)
Pumps are locked

She watches him turn and move inside

INT DELROYS FOOD AND GAS NIGHT SAME TIME

Darry steps in Darker than he expected Stares ahead Etched
in the light of a cigarette machine

He must look pretty bad because those who do catch a glimpse
of him take another one quickly

Like the PLUMP WAITRESS eye-balling him She is fifty-
something Name tag reads BEVERLY
JEEPERS CREEPERS 36

WAITRESS BEVERLY
Restrooms are for paying
customers kiddo

DARRY
Could we get some gas please

The woman looks out the window sees Trish leaning against
the car

WAITRESS
(a well worn rhyme)
Pumps locked at eight
oclock

Darry has no energy to argue Looks out at his sister

DARRY
Lights are still on

WAITRESS
(calls back to the kitchen)
Arnie you got the pump lights
on again

Trish suddenly plunged into darkness Waitress Beverly looks
back to Darry as if that settled everything

DARRY
We really need some gas

WAITRESS BEVERLY
You look like you need a
little more than gas kiddo

EXT DELROYS FOOD AND GAS NIGHT SAME TIME

Trish is fit to be tied Storms toward the diner Cursing
under her breath Is almost to the front doors when out on
the two lane comes the sound of a familiar engine

This is the sound of the van There can be no question
She spots it instantly Sailing down the highway Speeding
past Trentdale Knows it must be headed back to the old
church

INT DELROYS FOOD AND GAS NIGHT SAME TIME

Trish bursts in Patrons staring at her TWO TRUCKERS

especially They dont make eyes at her but she knows the
look Beverly pouring coffee for them
JEEPERS CREEPERS 37

WAITRESS BEVERLY
Pumps locked at eight oclock-

TRISH
This is an emergency

Her raised tone turns more than a few heads

TRISH
I need you to please call the
police
(off her look)
Right now Please get them
here right away

Waitress Beverly stares at her now

TRISH
Someone is dead Can you
please just call someone

Trish meets the eyes of other patrons who have heard this A
FAMILY with TWO SMALL CHILDREN -eyes wide staring back at
her

WAITRESS BEVERLY
Someones dead where

TRISH
Are you gonna call or not

Beverly regards her a moment longer and starts back toward
the kitchen The Mens Room Door opens and Darry comes out
Washed Looks better Until sister rushes at him

TRISH
I saw him I saw the van
again

Darry instantly panicked Runs toward the windows

TRISH
I think hes headed back to
the church

DARRY
You sure it was the van

TRISH
You think Im gonna forget
what it looks like
JEEPERS CREEPERS

Trish lets out an anxious sigh Falls against the wall
Between the cigarette machine and the payphone Holds her
face in her hands

DARRY
Come on big sis Hold it
together

She stares at the floor Wont look at him

DARRY
(takes her by the
shoulders)
Come on Just hold it
together
(waits for a response)
Think of a time

TRISH
I dont wanna think of a time

DARRY
I got one You were twelve
‘Cause I was nine

TRISH
Just shut-up Darry-

DARRY
And we found that big fat
potato bug out in the
backyard Remember how big it
was with the big feeler
things on its head

You bet me five dollars I
wouldnt be brave enough to
eat it

(she looks up at him)
You remember ‘Cause I
swallowed it Whole Could
feel it crawling down my
throat

Thought it was gonna make me
sick but I had to prove to big
sis that I wasnt afraid of
nothing

Then when I finished
swallowing it you didnt want
to pay me the five dollars so
you yelled Mom Darry ate a
bug

(MORE )
JEEPERS CREEPERS 39

DARRY (contd)

(the hint of a smile on her

face)
Remember I got spanked and
taught about not putting dirty
little things in my mouth
Remember What a nasty little
bitch you were

She smiles at him as much as shes able Darry thinking hes
cheered her up But her eyes well with tears as quickly and
she says in a frightened whisper

TRISH
I am so scared Darry He is
gonna get back to that church
and he is gonna know we were
down there

THE PAY PHONE RINGS LOUDLY BESIDE HER AND SHE SCREAMS

The entire restaurant is looking at her now Beverly on the
phone by the registers stares over Along with a roundish
furry looking man of fifty or so The MANAGER

She and little brother stare back at everyone Embarrassed

replaces the 45 and selects another The place fills with
music again

Trish and Darry at a table in back Beverly steps up to them
with a coffee pot

WAITRESS BEVERLY
You kids wanna piece of pie or
coffee or something

They shake their heads no staring at two STATE TROOPERS at
the counter conferring with the Manager

WAITRESS BEVERLY
Let me know if you change your
mind

You think they believe us

DARRY
All they have to do is drive
out to that church Theyll

JEEPERS CREEPERS 45

TRISH
You dont think thats it do

TRISH
Maybe were having one of
those dreams like in the
Twilight Zone where were all

You know We died out on the
road and we just dont know

DARRY
(quietly)
I wanna be home In my room
In my bed

He looks at her Tries to smile He looks so fragile

TRISH
We will get home you know

He nods Feeling foolish

Jeepers Creepers whered you get those peepers Jeepers
Creepers whered you get those eyes

The juke box Sinatra Darry’s blood runs cold Face
suddenly ashen

Stares across the diner at the juke Sis watching him
strangely Tries to follow his line of sight

Gosh all get up howd they get so lit up

He stands Looks down at sis “Gosh all get up how’d they
get that size”

TRISH
Darry

He moves now Through the diner As if drawn by the melody
“Golly gee when you turn those heaters on Woa is me got to
put my cheaters on”

Trish watches him from the table Has little brother gone off
his nut
JEEPERS CREEPERS 46

Patrons are stopping their eating Watching him as he passes
by in some confused trance

“Jeepers Creepers where’d you get those peepers Oh those
weepers how they hypnotize”

Darry at the jukebox now Staring down into its glow Thinks
he must be losing his mind His own striking eyes even more
beautiful in the golden glow of the machine

“Where’d you get those eyes”

The song goes instrumental He looks back at Trish The
Troopers are at her table Sis looking over at him Darry
moves back quickly

TROOPER GIDEON
Not saying anything-

Darry thrown by this Stares at the Trooper

TROOPER GIDEON
Look all Im trying to do here
is get the facts straight-

DARRY
I told you the facts this guy
drives a black van and it
nearly killed us

We saw him throw a body down a
pipe that dumps into a cellar
under the old church

I saw the body He was a guy
my age and he was still alive
except that hed been split
from his neck to his navel and
then sewn back up again

Now this guy must have a
hundred maybe two hundred
bodies down there and Ive
seen ‘em

move quickly toward the car

TROOPER GIDEON
Alright we dont need anymore

laundry in the car)
He is after us ‘cause he knows

Darry finishes with his clothes and goes to shut the door

DARRY
Hey you interested in a hand

Trish and the Troopers move quickly toward him

Gideon squats with Darry at the open car door Look at the
surface of the car handle It is smudged with some kind of
fine gray powder

DARRY
You can dust it right Get a
print

TROOPER GIDEON
Looks like somebody already
did

He looks up at his partner A breeze comes up and the print
starts to blow away

Gideon thinks fast Whips out an evidence bag and catches
some of it as it blows into the wind

A SLOW CRANE UP As we rise slowly

DARRY
What the Hell is that stuff

TROOPER GIDEON
Gonna find out real quick
JEEPERS CREEPERS 51

Everybody just keep calm
Everythings gonna get taken
care of

---until we are high above the parking lot Everyone below
just tiny dots of jabbering color We have ascended finally
to the top of the sign that reads DELROYS FOOD AND GAS

And atop that a dark Figure is perched His long black coat
flapping in the night wind as he stares down

Like some dark bird of prey

TRISH
Onto the roof of a building

Darry feels dumb Stares out the window

the roof of their escorts car

BWUMP ANOTHER SOUND FROM THE ROOF OF THE POLICE CAR Both
Troopers startled

TROOPER GIDEON
Hold on Central

A puzzled Trooper Weston rolls down the window Rises out of
her seat Head out the window to get a look up top
EXT TROOPER CAR COUNTRY HIGHWAY NIGHT SAME TIME

Trooper Weston stretches higher now looks out over the roof
of the patrol car--

What she sees moves so fast in the windy night she cant
even react—
JEEPERS CREEPERS 56

INT TROOPER CAR COUNTRY HIGHWAY NIGHT SAME TIME

Trooper Westons body is yanked out of the car Through the
open window Gone in one powerful violent motion

HER SCREAM swallowed instantly as she disappears
Trooper Gideon in shock No time to even turn his head--
WHAM The large razor sharp blade of a battle axe breaks
through the roof of the police car --right in front of his
face
INT TRISHS CAR COUNTRY HIGHWAY NIGHT SAME TIME
The kids still listening to the loud song Behind them the
patrol car swerves erratically Something dark still riding
on top of it
DARRY
(shouting)
Theyre gonna be in Concert in
August downtown

EXT TROOPER CAR COUNTRY HIGHWAY NIGHT SAME TIME

Trooper Gideons head is yanked up through a hole ripped in
the roof of the car

The Figure that grips him rears back with the same razor-
sharp battle axe Almost Medieval-looking

And in one neat swoop -swings it at the Troopers head

INT TRISHS CAR COUNTRY HIGHWAY NIGHT SAME TIME

Angle behind brother and sister ROCK SONG BLARING AS

-something big hits the roof of the car Hard and fast Flies
down the windshield and off the hood

Trish slams on the brakes Both of them clutching the
dashboard The car swings to a halt in the middle of the two-
lane

TRISH
What was that

Brother sticks his head out the window Stares into the night
sky Sis looking behind them
JEEPERS CREEPERS 57

The Trooper vehicle angled across the two lane It too has
made a hurried stop No movement inside Dark and silent
Silhouetted in the moonlight

DARRY
What the Hell

Brother and sister look at each other Darrys head again out
the window

DARRY (cont’d)
Hey

Darrys voice echoes into the night

DARRY (cont’d)
You okay in there

Darry gets out Trish follows

DARRY (cont’d)
Stay here

Trish looks at him No way

Darry takes a tentative step toward the moonlit vehicle
Wishes he could see more

Trish seeing the dents on the roof of her car where the
object hit Dents with a spatter pattern Blood

TRISH
Darry

Looks back at her She holds up three fingers smudged with
blood

DARRY
(screams at the car)
Hey

The cars police lights flash on Startles Darry and Trish
Both squinting into them

DARRY (cont’d)
Get back in the car
(turns to Trish)
Get back in the car

Someone is staring out behind the wheel of that car

Peering at them through the angry flashes of red and blue
through a windshield spattered with blood
JEEPERS CREEPERS 58

DARRY (cont’d)
Trish get in the car

Trish paling Turning to do this Caught by the sight of
something else

Down the road -just past the police car A roundish thing in
the middle of the highway -silhouetted in moonlight

Trooper Gideons head Staring out at her with dead eyes
This is what hit them and rolled off the hood

TRISH
Darry

Darry trying to make out the face in the flaring lights The
eyes So white

DARRY
Trish

The patrol cars door swings open and both of them whirl
around Back toward their own vehicle Leaping in

Trish behind the wheel Grapples for the stick shift in a
blind panic Darry just as fast into the passenger seat
Slams the door

A tall powerful silhouette rises out of the patrol car
Turning instantly away from them

DARRY (cont’d)
Whoa did you see that

As it turns -its face glints for a moment in the moonlight
The eyes So white because they are just that and nothing
else

No pupils or irises A trick of the moonlight

Trish staring The car hasnt moved Her hand still on the
stickshift

The figure walks away from them with a chillingly casual
gait His black coat flapping cape-like And in the glare of
the flashing red and blue walks back toward Gideons head

Whistling Whistling a tune the kids have heard in the diner
Jeepers Creepers whered you get those Peepers

Brother and sister transfixed Watching as with a single
hand the Figure reaches down and lifts Gideons head by the
hair Holds it then in both hands Looking at it
JEEPERS CREEPERS 59

Holds it high Level with its own eyes Draws it closer So
close he could be kissing it

DARRY (cont’d)
(a whisper)
Im not seeing this

The Figure turns the grizzly thing around now Does the same
with the back of the head

And both kids realize what he is doing Smelling it

DARRY (cont’d)
What the Hell are we looking
at Trish

More horrid disbelief as the figure drop kicks the head -
sending it high in the sky and off into the tall grass of the
nearby field

DARRY (cont’d)
Lets get the Hell outta
here

The Figure turns now Staring back at them

DARRY
Go

Trish guns the engine and the car screams back down the
highway

The dark figure watches this from afar Still as a statue

INT TRISHS CAR COUNTRY HIGHWAY NIGHT SAME TIME

DARRY
What is this guy

Sees her brother staring out the rear

DARRY
What is this guy Trish
Whatd he do to those cops

TRISH

JEEPERS CREEPERS 60

DARRY (contd)
Like hes playing with us
Like running us off the road
was just some kind of game

EXT LONELY COUNTRY ROAD NIGHT

Back at the scene of the crime the empty patrol car engine
running rolls slowly off the highway and into a field

The dark Figure watches only for a moment -moving away while
the car still travels pilotless deeper into the field

Before it even settles WE CAN THE HEAR THE RUMBLE OF THE
DARK VANS ENGINE We leave the patrol car for a glimpse at
the highway when-

WOOSHHH The dark van rips past us down the moonlit two
lane

EXT ANOTHER STRETCH OF COUNTRY ROAD NIGHT MINUTES LATER

Both Trish and Darry see it at the same time A farmhouse
Down a gravel drive off the road Lights on in the windows

TRISH
Theres a phone
DARRY
You sure you wanna stop
TRISH
I wanna get to anyone who can
help us
DARRY

Whats the next town

TRISH
I dont know and Im not gonna
wait to find out

Trish takes the gravel drive Jostles down the lane

TRISH
Look we just ask to use the
phone okay We dont freak
these people out

The house comes into more detail Old and sagging But its
warmly lit windows like a beacon Of safety Sanity
JEEPERS CREEPERS 61

TRISH
We dont wanna scare em We
just wanna call for help

Headlights etching the overgrown garden that is the front
yard An ancient pick-up to one side In the center of the
overgrowth a sagging thing scarcely presuming to be a
scarecrow

DARRY
Too spooky

Trish looks at him Hes serious

DARRY
Too spooky Lets just get the
Hell outta here

At the outskirts of the yard a plastic sunflower ticks away
in a night breeze as the car comes to a halt

TRISH
Its pretty run down Hope
they have a phone

DARRY
I hope they have a gun

TRISH
I hope they dont

She opens the door Gets out Darry too Their first look is
to the highway Empty For as far as the eye can see

KER-CLINK THE DISTINCT SOUND OF A RIFLE BEING COCKED turns
the kids quickly toward the house

CAT LADY
Who are you

A WOMANS RASPY VOICE From a silhouette behind the screen
door A blue-black rifle barrel glinting in its hands

CAT LADY

The screen door opens now and THE CAT LADY steps out A
strange looking woman of fifty or so Very intense around the
eyes

TRISH
We just came from there-

MEOWWW Sounds of cats at her feet She pushes a couple
back inside the screen with a foot A foot wearing a fuzzy
pink slipper

Darry staring down at the felines Remembers instantly the
strange phone call at the diner Did you see the cats yet

TRISH
Its a ways back You cant
see it from here

The Woman levels her eyes at the two Judging them Her shot
gun still clenched tightly

CAT LADY
All right one call
(off their looks)
But be quick my babies they

Trisha just stares at the old woman She has children
JEEPERS CREEPERS 63

Trish climbs the porch steps Sees Darry still staring down
at the cats inside the door

Trisha doesnt understand Makes a face that tells him to
hurry up He starts forward Cat Lady opens the screen for
them -again holding one feline inside with a fuzzy slipper

CAT LADY
Careful I dont let ‘em out

DARRY

CAT LADY

Trish and Darry halt instantly as they step inside

The living room is covered with cats All kinds All shapes
All sizes There must be forty of them in the living room
alone

CAT LADY
Phones there by the love

The Cat Lady shuts the front door and steps past them Stows
the rifle in a closet

Trish covers her nose with a hand Makes a face at Darry The
smell is terrible

CAT LADY
Policeman killed you say

Darry still caught in an uneasy trance That phone call Did

DARRY

Trish looks at him like hes crazy The Cat Lady turns to
them now Trish lowers her hands from her nose

CAT LADY
People think they can drive
like maniacs ‘round here Cops

JEEPERS CREEPERS 64

CAT LADY (contd)
Just a bunch of punk kids with
badges and guns if you ask me

Trish moves to the phone It too surrounded by felines
Scatters a few as she reaches down and lifts the receiver

CAT LADY
Who is that making a call on
your telephone hmm Who is
that

She is asking the one cat that remains Sniffing Trisha as
she dials

CAT LADY
Thats the thing about cats
(off Darrys look)
Can whiff a bad egg a mile
away Cant they Tomfoolery

Darry realizes she is referring to the cat that now rubs
itself against his legs

CAT LADY
Oh he likes you Lookee that
He wants you to pick him up

Darry nods Tries to press out a polite smile

CAT LADY
Dont be afraid

Darry bends Pets the cats head

CAT LADY

He regards her Did she just say that Must mean something
else He lifts the cat into his arms Pets its head

CAT LADY

shaking her head adamantly

year with their zoning crap

cats a person can have

PHONE VOICE
(filtered)
You said you needed to report
an emergency

But the VOICE IS SUDDENLY SWALLOWED BY ANGRY STATIC ON THE
LINE Trish holds the phone away from her ear

Cat Lady and Darry watching She clicks the clicker Puts the
phone back to her ear Nothing

TRISH
Your phone just went dead

She is looking at her brother and thinking the worse

The Cat Lady marches over to hear for herself Puts the phone
to her ear as the lights go out all over the house
JEEPERS CREEPERS 66

Darry Trish the Cat Lady and her many fuzzy minions
suddenly plunged into darkness

Darry rushing to the window -the cat still in his arms

EXT FARMHOUSE NIGHT SAME TIME

Out in the overgrown garden the plastic sunflower again
clicks to a stop in the silent moonlit yard

INT FARMHOUSE NIGHT SAME TIME

DARRY
Theres nobody out there

Then every cat in the place lifts its head in unison

Forty pairs of cats eyes staring toward the front windows
Trish and Darry watching this As growing from every corner
of the room are the wicked hisses of frightened cats
everywhere

The cat in Darrys arms freaks -clawing and thrashing to free
itself

DARRY
Ouch

He winces in pain as THE ANIMAL YOWLS and hits the floor
running Cat Lady rushing to the front window Trish and
Darry with her

The overgrown yard is dark with inky shadows Her distressed
scarecrow standing in the middle of it

MORE CATS HISSING Fur standing on end Fangs bared Whatever
is out there these animals do not like it

CAT LADY
Ill be Goddamned

The Cat Lady storming back to the closet for her rifle The
kids looking after her

CAT LADY
Thats not my scarecrow
JEEPERS CREEPERS

EXT FARMHOUSE NIGHT SAME TIME

Shot rolling slowly toward The inky silhouette of the
scarecrow It is larger than we remember it And better

dressed In a long black coat

The Figure stands before the old hay-stuffed thing-creating a

single silhouette

Cutting a tall dark shadow against the starry night sky One

with eyes we can barely discern

Eyes that might not belong to any human thing

INT FARMHOUSE NIGHT SAME TIME

The cats are going berserk Two of them topple the phone

table Others run in confused circles around the couch

Several scramble over the base of the floor lamp Send it on
its side with a loud crash Still others are scaling the

drapes --clawing their way toward the ceiling
The Cat Lady watches puzzled by her felines

CAT LADY
Who the Hell is that

Cocks the rifle loudly and throws open the front door

the rifle at the scarecrow

CAT LADY
You gotta ‘bout ten seconds to
get your ass outta my yard

Levels

The ScarecrowFigure stands Continues to stare in at them

Silhouetted in the moonlight
CAT LADY
Dont think Im gonna tell you
twice

Its voice Strange A raspy whisper

THE CREATURE
My children

Trish and Darry exchange glances

CAT LADY
What

A chilling whisper in the night
JEEPERS CREEPERS 68

THE CREATURE
Ive come for my children

Trish and Darry frozen by these words The old woman turns to
look at them

When the Figure bolts toward the house
Cat Lady whirls about Fires KA-BLAM

THE SCARECROW DISINTEGRATES RIPPING INTO SHADOWY BITS THAT
EXPLODE IN EVERY DIRECTION SOMETHING LARGER RIPPING SKYWARD
AT THE MOMENT OF IMPACT

The Figure is gone Vanished into thin air Unless

Cat Lady Darry and Trish crowd the doorway trying to see
out Darrys gaze caught by something high

Catches a terrifying glimpse of it scrambling up the front of
the house Like some horrible caped insect As if gravity
simply did not exist

DARRY
What in the Holy-

His cutting whispers turns the women to him Stares at them
in shock

KER-KRASH A WINDOW BREAKS SOMEWHERE UPSTAIRS All three
whirl around Staring up at the ceiling

Then cats are dropping past the front windows Dropping down
into the yard From the second story They land on their
feet Scurrying off into the night

Trish and Darry look at each other with mounting panicThe
Cat Lady looks to brother and sis What the Hell did you
bring into my house

AS SUDDENLY A FRIGHTENED AND VOCAL TORRENT OF CATS RUSH IN
GREAT PANIC DOWN THE STAIRS

WITH THE SOUND FROM ABOVE OF ONE CAT CLEARLY ATTACKING -the
Cat lady storms toward the stairs brandishing her rifle

CAT LADY
Get away from my babies you
sons-of-a-bitches

DARRY
Dont

Darry charges for her Grabs the old woman
JEEPERS CREEPERS 69

DARRY
Dont go up there

CAT LADY
Goddammit

DARRY
Leave now With us

CAT LADY
Goddammit
(screaming up the stairs)
Dont you hurt my babies-

She catches Darry in the groin with a nasty kick HE YELPS
Crumples as she charges up the steps

TRISH
Darry

Sis hurries to him Starts dragging him toward the front
door She just wants out Wants to go

CAT LADY
Ill blow your Goddamned head
off-

But at the top of the stairs the Cat Lady is suddenly
wrenched off her feet

The kids watch as her fuzzy pink slippers disappear from
view Straight up

THEY HEAR HER GASP ONLY ONCE NOW A CHOKED GARGLING SOUND
The kids staring up at the top step where here feet vanished

The cats are in absolute frenzy Some baring fangs in the
direction of the stairs others climbing the old drapes of
the place in a frantic panic to get out To get away

Trish dashing back toward the front door with injured Darry
Halted by the sight of those slippers -slipping now slowly
back into view on the top step

Something just out of sight at the top of the stairs is
holding her there Feet dangling One slipper falls off

Darry approaches in horror Wants to see up those stairs
Wants to see just what the Hell this thing is

At the foot of the stairs he looks up Can see her body
hanging there lifeless -held in the iron grip of the long
coated Figure --pulling the old woman into him as if she were
a doll
JEEPERS CREEPERS 70

And sniffing Sniffing her The same way he did the officers
decapitated head

Darry throws a look to his sister at the door hand on the
knob -frozen by her brothers paling expression

Darry looks back the Figure takes another long inhale and
then peers around the dangling old woman Out of the shadows
and down the stairs --directly at him

For the first time Darry sees its face clearly

Though the features are human The glaring blind whites of
the eyes -where pupils should be- give a much more terrifying
impression

Not of something human but of something else

Something dark and powerful that only wears the guise of
human Something utterly horrible and without conscience

It stares at him a chilling moment longer Again its raspy
voice whispering from its lips

THE CREATURE
She doesnt smell too good
Darry

Darry bolts He is to the door so fast he turns the knob
before his sister can

EXT FARMHOUSE NIGHT SAME TIME

Trish and Darry blasting outside A flurry of fleeing cats
also pour down the porch steps with them spilling into the

front yard The kids scramble to their car

Trish flies behind the wheel and turns the key Engine not
turning over

Darrys eyes scanning the dark face of the farmhouse MORE
COMMOTION INSIDE CATS SCREAMING

Trish with the key Grinding the ignition It starts

KA-TASSSHHHH THE LARGE UPSTAIRS WINDOW EXPLODES OUT IN A
POWERFUL SHOWER OF GLASS AND WOOD

The Creature leaps into the night
Darry and Trish watching it Some kind of nightmare streaking

across the white of the half moon and then dropping down
Down into the yard
JEEPERS CREEPERS 71

Impossibly it lands on its feet Crouched low to the ground
Like some horrible beast ready to pounce

Putting its sites -those horrible blank eyes- on the kids

DARRY
Go Go Go

The car squeals out of the yard down the gravel drive and
back toward the highway

Darry watching as the Creature sprints across the yard
Disappears in the darkness as the farmhouse gets smaller and
smaller

DARRY
You see his face

Trish grapples the wheel Taking the dark highway as fast as
she is able

WOOOONNNNKKKKKK THE HORRIBLE HORN BLARES BEHIND THEM

The van is close -its headlights blasting the interior of the
car Startling them as much as the horn

DARRY
What is this guy trying to
do

TRISH
Darry

Trish has her own problem up ahead The railroad crossing
lights flashing automated arms lowering AND BELLS ARE
RINGING LOUDLY

conductor

DARRY

Are you crazy

DARRY

JEEPERS CREEPERS 73

The van is all over both lanes weaving back and forth
BLASTING THAT HIDEOUS TAUNTING HORN

TRISH
He wants us to

Darry stares at her She knows this

DARRY
Trish faster

TRISH
(emphatically)
We are going to die

DARRY
Just do it

THE TRAIN HORN BLARES ITS FINAL WARNING

Trish slams the pedal to the metal and takes her sedan
blasting through the barrier arms

It lurches across the track as the train roars at them like
an iron beast

They fly over the tracks The train just nicking their rear
bumper Sends them spinning

Brother and sister collectively trying to grab the wheel
Spinning out of control while the train cuts them off from
the van

The van which slams on its brakes and swerves dangerously
close to the tracks and the train

On the other side the sedan stops spinning Trish trying get her
bearings Darry still has his hands on the wheel with hers

TRISH
Let go of the wheel

Darry looks behind him Nothing but the train CLANKING
NOISILY over the tracks

DARRY
We gotta move

Trish grabs the gearshift but it wont budge Darry sees this

TRISH
Somethings wrong
JEEPERS CREEPERS 74

DARRY
Dont say that

CLANK CLANK CLANK The trains cars fly by -their only
barrier from the van and their predator

TRISH
The gears are sticking-

DARRY
(jaw tightening)
Unstick em Trish

TRISH
What do you want me to do

Trish and Darry both grapple the stick shift Cant wrestle
the car into first gear

DARRY
Goddammit

TRISH
Youre gonna break it

Not seeing as we do something black shooting into the sky
from the other side of the train

BA-WAMMMM SOMETHING HITS THE TRUNK OF THE CAR HITS IT
HARD ROCKING IT VIOLENTLY

Bro and sis stare out the back The Creature is crouched
there -staring in at them with those horrible eyes

DARRY
He jumped over the train
Trish
Trish grinding that stickshift -trying with all her might
DARRY
He jumped over the train
Trish

C1UNK The cars transmission falls into gear and Trish guns
the engine

The car lurches ahead --jolting the Creature It clutches the
sides of the car as she speeds forward

Darry in a stunned numbed kind of shock

Trish dips onto the shoulder of the road Trying to make the
ride rough Swings across both lanes Weaving erratically
JEEPERS CREEPERS 75

Trying desperately to lose the thing on the trunk

Trish slams on the brakes The car swings sideways violently
Finally flinging it into the air

The kids watch as he flails into space Coat flapping around
him -like a giant bat who has suddenly lost its equilibrium

Hitting the asphalt hard and rolling and skidding Things
falling out of his coat as he does

The battle axe CLANGING noisily on the ground and another
insidious looking knife bouncing on the asphalt with a
couple of others --like the Creature coming to an abrupt and
violent halt

DARRY
What the Hell are those

Trish just staring at the motionless heap of black under the
moonlight

The trains final car moves down the tracks behind them
Revealing the dark van just beyond the flashing railroad
lights

Brother and sister staring ahead at the lifeless heap THE
SOUND OF THE TRAIN FADES IN THE DISTANCE AND THE BELLS AT THE
TRAIN CROSSING CEASE

Silence now Only the sound of their breathing in the car
until Darrys whisper

DARRY
Hit him

She looks at her little brother

DARRY
Hit him Trish
(off her look)
Hard

She looks out the windshield That lifeless mass sprawled on
the highway

DARRY
Do it

She opens her mouth to respond -when the Creatures head
rises It is staring at them Those blind ugly eyes burning
out toward them
JEEPERS CREEPERS 76

Trish slams the pedal to the metal Corrects the position of
the car and rockets forward with as much speed as she can
build

The Creatures face caught in the glare of the headlights as
WHAM Trish slams into it hard

The cars wheels pummel it savagely Both kids grimacing with
THE TERRIBLE SOUNDS OF CRACKING AND CRUNCHING BENEATH THEIR
TIRES

Trish stops now Looks back at her handiwork

The cape has flapped over the Creatures head and its
lifeless figure complete with tire tracks lays a little
flatter on the two-lane

Brother and sister exchange glances

TRISH
You think hes dead

DARRY
They never are

TRISH
Right

Trish throws the car in reverse and speeds back at the
lifeless shape

KER-POP A sickeningly distinct sound as the tires roll over
its legs this time

Trish comes to a halt behind it Staring ahead into the high
beams there can be no mistaking this thing is flattened

On the asphalt at the end of one coat sleeve a hand lay
crushed Tire treads over it Even bones crushed and flaking
like Greek pastry

Blowing away now The whole hand blowing away Dust in the
wind

In fact LOTS of powder is blowing out from under that black
coat

The kids watch in awe Have they crushed this thing to dust

DARRY
Lets get outta here
JEEPERS CREEPERS 77

TRISH
I dont know how much farther
this cars gonna go

DARRY
Far enough

Trish guns the engine again -a final trouncing for the Thing
in the road as they roar over it and speed into the distance

INT POHO COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPT NIGHT AN HOUR LATER

main highway about twenty
miles before Trentdale

I am serious mom were okay

opposite wall

A long bulletin board of missing persons An ocean of faces
Men women and children Some of the headings read HAVE YOU
SEEN ME

Darry stares ahead numbly All the faces staring back at him

their true love for each other

who is off duty tonight He’d
tell you different

DESK SERGEANT
Jezelle likes to think she’s
the resident psychic around
here

Behind her back the Sergeant signals to the kids that she is
not to be taken seriously

DESK SERGEANT
She helped us on a missing
persons a few years ago-

JEZELLE
You think you could just let
me talk to these kids for five
minutes by myself

THE PHONE AT THE DESK CHIRPING INCESSANTLY The Sergeant
moves to answer it

DESK SERGEANT
Go home turn that Goddamned
police scanner off and go to
bed

JEZELLE
And you go do something
useful you got officers

Trish and Darry left staring at the woman
JEEPERS CREEPERS

JEZELLE
You don’t have to believe I’m
psychic But I can tell you
something these cops havent
(off their look)

That dust they got off your
car back at Delroy’s It
tested as human skin over a
hundred and fifty years old

Darry and Trish listen to her

JEZELLE
That didn’t come in a dream I
heard it on the police
scanner I got more to tell
you and I come a long way to
do it

DARRY
You know I’m really not sure
we should be talking to
anybody right now-

JEZELLE
I know what it is

Her voice a sudden and urgent whisper

JEZELLE
I know what’s chasing you

She has their full attention now
JEZELLE

You found a lot of bodies
(off Darry’s incredulous

look )
Down in that cellar I saw ‘em
too

(swallows )

You see the cats yet I saw
you with cats too Lots of

cats-

DARRY
You called At the diner that

JEZELLE

I saw those bodies just like

the stitches all down him I
saw you there with him
JEEPERS CREEPERS 81

DARRY
How

JEZELLE
Dreamed it
(waits for a response)
I dream a lot of things

The womans self-assuredness is dissolving She stares at
them with eyes flickering with fear and sadness

JEZELLE
Those bodies down there You
found its house of pain

Darry doesn’t know why but his blood runs cold

JEZELLE
I don’t know how I know that
I just know that’s what it
likes to call it

DARRY
What likes to call it

JEZELLE
It’s got a whole lotta names
From a whole lotta different
times and places

Eater of the Dead That’s
the one that keeps coming to
me

DARRY
Eater of the

JEEPERS CREEPERS 82

JEZELLE (contd)

Every twenty-third Spring For
twenty-three days It gets to

lungs so it can breathe

TRISH
(standing pointedly)
I’m gonna be sick Darry would
you come and help me throw up
please

DARRY
Look this thing has had
chances to kill us and it
didnt

This makes Jezelle even more uncomfortable What she now has
to say

JEZELLE
(swallows her eyes
dampening)
Its very particular Only
wants certain parts from
certain bodies

One of you has something it
might like

(Darry swallows)
It wont stop following until
it knows for sure

DARRY
By trying to run us off the
road

JEZELLE

(shakes her head yes her

voice a cutting whisper)
It needs to scare you

(finds Trishs eyes)
Theres something in fear
Something it can smell

Brother and sister stare at her

JEZELLE
Makes it easier for it To
know if theres anything ina

EXT POHO COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT NIGHT SAME TIME

Many off duty patrol cars TWO OFFICERS just sitting down in
theirs Coffee cups in hand Engine turns over and they roll
out of the lot

While at the opposite end an old dark van rolls into view
Its familiar license plate vibrating slightly with the rough
idle of the engine

BEATNGU

Now we think about the other way this plate could be read Be
Eating You

JEZELLE (V0)
I dont know what it is
exactly If its a Demon or a
Devil or just some hungry
thing from a wicked place
somewhere in time

The van door swings open Engine still running as one of the
Creatures feet sets down on the asphalt Its black shoe
marred with a tire track

JEZELLE (V0)
I just know its been doing
this for a lot longer than a
hundred and fifty years

And it is not gonna stop
Coming after you or anyone
else it wants to

The other leg swings out awkwardly Out of a tattered pant
leg the foot hangs -barely attached Only by a length of dead
flesh and a torn sock
JEEPERS CREEPERS 84

JEZELLE (0S)
Cause once it has the scent
of something it likes

With this horrid handicap the Creature starts a grizzly
almost comical limp across the shadowy parking lot

JEZELLE (0S)
It cant It cant stop

Jezelle pleading with Darry and Trish Her voice an urgent
whisper

heart is breaking Like there is something else she knows

Something too terrible for her to say

DARRY

Jezelle shakes her head no Cant speak it

DARRY

Darry takes her by her plump arms Forces her to look at him

DARRY

The Desk Sergeant lifts the phone

DESK SERGEANT
We got lights out up here

The facility has come to an abrupt standstill Trish Darry
and Jezelle eyes toward the ceiling

INT POHO SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT JAIL LEVEL NIGHT SAME TIME

A flashlight blares out the dark as OFFICER TIM MCCURRY
starts the long walk down a shadowy row of cells

OFFICER MCCURRY
Heads up gentlemen

His flashlight falls over the first cell Two bodies sleeping
in upper and lower bunks

OFFICER MCCURRY
I said heads up gentlemen
Show me some skin
JEEPERS CREEPERS 86

The INMATE in the upper bunk stares groggily into the glare
of the flashlight

INMATE
What the Hells wrong with
you man

OFFICER MCCURRY
We have a black out gentlemen
That means emergency head
count
(drops his beam to the
lower bunk)
Lower bunk show me some skin

An angry hand juts out from under the blanket -middle finger
extended The Officer moves onto the next cell

OFFICER MCCURRY
Head count gentlemen

UPPER AND LOWER BUNKMATES peer into the beam Officer McCurry
moves to the next Stops when he hears A SOUND

-A WET SOUND

McCurry follows it Moves quickly past several more cells
THE SOUND HAS GONE FROM SLURPING TO CRUNCHING

He is at the end of hall now Approaching the last and
darkest cell The flashlight falling over something McCurry
cannot believe

The bars to this cell have been bent outward and apart

McCurry fumbles with his free hand to get his service pistol
out of his holster Takes another step

The man in the cell freezes when the beam of light hits him
Dressed in a long black coat Squatting over something on the
floor

McCurry looks down

The body of AN INMATE lies in a pool of dark blood At the
end of his right leg -the foot has been chewed completely
off

McCurry in shock

The Figure ignoring the Officers presence now returns to
his work Bows his head Suddenly thrashing it back and
forth The lifeless inmate rocking with the same violent
motions
JEEPERS CREEPERS 87

McCurry moving fast now Leaps before the cell Levels his
pistol

The Figures head drops back

McCurry halted by that horrible WET CRUNCHING SOUND as the
inmates arm falls into view

His hand gone A bloody stump adding more crimson to the
floor

McCurry cocks his pistol The sound is loud and causes the
Figure to turn Slowly Until he is staring up at McCurry
past the gun barrel

McCurry paralyzed The Creatures white eyes glaring up at
him Its mouth and chin a bloody mess

McCurry should have fired by now Too perplexed and horrified
at what he is staring at

THWAMM It moves so fast McCurry only feels the bars of
the cell slamming into his face -and service pistol flying
out of his hand with the impact

He has been grappled in a blurring moment of speed through
the bars of the cell by the Creatures one good hand

The other hand non-existent Just an empty sleeve as he
holds Officer McCurry against those bars

Nose to nose Surveying the Officer Those malevolent white
eyes staring into him

THE SOUND OF TRICKLING SOMETHING TRICKLING ONTO THE GROUND

Both cop and Creature look down at the Creatures empty
sleeve A grayish powder trickles out of it

And with it a new hand Drops down from inside the sleeve
and splays its fingers Replacing the one pummelled into dust
by the tire of Trishs car

The Creature takes McCurrys head in both hands now Leans
in Close Closer

And sniffs Sniffs him Leans in now Inhales him Savoring
his scent -To the Officers horror and surprise

LEVELS THOSE MALEVOLENT EYES AT HIM NOW --AND ROARS THE
CREATURES MOUTH GAPING OPEN AND COLLIDING WITH HIS HEAD
JEEPERS CREEPERS 88

We cannot see clearly what is happening at the dark end of
the corridor -just McCurrys arms and legs flailing madly as
HE SCREAMS

corridor Away from the lobby

JEZELLE
Come on I said

They move with her Darry taking a final look back at the
lobby where Officers now hug the walls Staring down a
corridor that ends in the rear stairwell

The Sergeant stares with the others at the dark stairwell
Illuminated by a single dollop of light from one of the
emergency overheads

Four cops flank the walls before it Weapons drawn The
Sergeant hisses an urgent whisper into his walkie

suddenly flickers up the wall and out of view

Officers staring puzzled Where did this guy go

This guy is wearing something
‘cause we cannot take him
down Copy We cannot take him
down

They can hear something moving Getting closer Guns aimed
down those dark stairs

One of the Officers DANE looks to the Sergeant Gets a nod
Dane moves forward Hugging the wall Very close to the
stairwell now

Jumps aside the doorway Braves a look down Nothing on the
stairs Hears something in the stillness

A sniffing sound Somewhere in the dark They can all hear
it Puzzled by it

Down the stairs Officer Dane looks back at the Sergeant Not
seeing what everyone else does behind him

THE CREATURE’S HEAD DROPPING INTO VIEW FROM ABOVE
JEEPERS CREEPERS 93

Hanging upside down just inside the stairwell doorway The
officers swing their guns to this horrible visage when -
PLOSSHH

OFFICER DANE’S FACE ERUPTS IN SHOCK SPRAYED SUDDENLY WITH
CRIMSON HIS CHEST HAS THE CREATURE’S HAND STICKING OUT OF
IT

HE HAS PUNCHED RIGHT THROUGH IT In the Creatures horrible
hand -THE OFFICERS STILL-PUMPING HEART

The Creature swings back up out of view Taking his bloody
parcel with him The men staring ahead in shock

Dane just stares wide-eyed with the hole in his chest

SLURPING AND GARGLING SOUNDS as the unseen Creature ingests
what onlookers dont want to believe he could be

The heartless Officer tries to say something now but cant
manage it Falls back and tumbles down the stairs

The Desk Sergeant and his men are the color of chalk as they
regard each other in the terrible silent shadows of the dark
hall

Plaster and dust flying everywhere as the Creature blasts
through the wall and onto his feet before the startled
onlookers

He is instantly moving Stepping forward in long powerful
strides through the dust and the confusion --directly at the
Officers and their guns

Everyone opens fire -bullets ripping through the Creature

ONE OFFICER SCREAMS BEHIND HIM -HIS BODY RIDDLED WITH THE
SAME BULLETS --FLYING RIGHT THROUGH THE CREATURE AND INTO
HIM

The men watch in horror as the Officer flails back and
crashes to the floor

The Creature reaches out Yanks another off his feet
Twitches and convulses as the grip cuts off his air

The Creature still moving With his other hand grips the
Officer by the groin Holds him out now A human shield as he
strides down the dark corridor watching the other Officers
retreat in shock and confusion

Two Officers behind him running at him One has his pistol
leveled The other screaming at him not to shoot
JEEPERS CREEPERS 94

OFFICER TWO
No

Charges ahead himself A flying tackle at the Creature’s
back But it is like hitting a mountain He hits hard and
hangs on -grappling the Creature around the neck

The Creature still moving Not even slowed One man hanging
on his back and one he still holds in front of him

Others retreating Scared What the Hell is this thing

DESK SERGEANT
Goddammit

The Sergeant remains in the middle of the hall -his revolver
aimed at the approaching nightmare

The Officer on the Creature’s back starts to pistol whip him
Desperately trying to stop him But in a swift and vicious
move it swings around -slamming its back into the nearest
wall

Slamming it hard The Officer with it The plaster on the
wall cracks with the impact

The Officer’s eyes go wide as he spits blood He collapses on
the floor in a heap as the Creature continues on His human
shield staring at him -eyes bulging Air still cut off

DESK SERGEANT
Goddammit stop You stop
right fucking there

The Creature raises his human shield over his head Before
the men can fire at his exposed chest --hurls the Officer at
them

But this is no ordinary throw -the man is rocketing down the
corridor as if propelled out of a catapult

Men are diving out of his way One taken out completely
Tumbling down the corridor with him and smashing into a glass
trophy case

IT CRASHES NOISILY TO THE GROUND ON TOP OF THEM GLASS AND
TROPHIES GOING EVERYWHERE

to Jezelle

TRISH
We have to get out

JEZELLE
There’s no other way out down
here except the front

TRISH
How are we gonna get out from
upstairs

Darry sees it first At the far end of the hall A familiar
Silhouette Still Impassive

JEZELLE
Upstairs

Trish and Darry dash up the stairs and The Creature takes off
toward them like a rocket

Sprints so fast his coat billows in his wake like dark wings

Jezelle just kneels No chance she could make it up those
stairs fast enough Instead bows her head in prayer as the
Creature races toward her

JEZELLE
Our Father who art in Heaven
hallowed be Thy name

The Creature is so close she can feel his wind can feel it
blasting past her

Her moment of doom has passed quickly She turns and sees the
Creature racing up the stairs at top speed

Trish and Darry running for their lives Where to they don’t
know The corridors are dark and maze-like

Stopping finally Confused whether to keep moving or find a
place and hide

They don’t have to think long The Creature roars into view
ahead of them and they start a nightmare flight back into the
maze

The Creature pursues with incredible speed The kids
practically falling around corners they are running so fast

Behind them like some Dark Avenger the Creature soars
Gaining Always gaining

Rounds another corner and halts The kids gone Several doors
they could’ve slipped into He chooses one

The Creature in the doorway This is an interrogation room
Dark and empty Caught by its own reflection in the large
mirror on the wall

A two-way mirror On the other side Trish and Darry
watching breathless Terrified as the Creature surveys the
mirror and steps toward it

The kids silent Holding each other The terrible visage of
the Thing pressed against the glass now Does it sense
something behind it

Those white eyes staring in As if they could see through it

And then its tongue comes out Long Licks the glass from low
to high in some horrible pre-culinary gesture

Trish and Darry watching with repulsion Then relief Having
left a snail trail on the mirror the Creature is turning
away Turning away from the mirror and-

KER-TASSSSHHH The plexi-window explodes as the Creature
crashes through it Trish and Darry scrambling back ina
blind panic and a shower of glass
JEEPERS CREEPERS 97

The Creature in the center of the room Poised like an
animal ready to pounce

Trish and Darry can barely move Paralyzed with fear as the
Thing steps closer Backs them to the wall Brother and
sister side by side

Those hideous milky eyes glare at Trish Burning into her
Watches as he inches closer

Darry starts to move Pinned against the wall instantly by
the Creatures iron grip Pinned there watching as the
Creature moves even closer to his sister

TRISH
(barely a whisper)
Darry

Nose to nose now they are so close She can feel the horrid
stench of his cannibal breath Its horrible raspy whisper
now

THE CREATURE
Sister sister

Watches in terror as it gets so close she thinks it might
kiss her

But it sniffs her instead

Short little sniffs at first Darry and Trish watching this
in horror

Then sniffs long and deep as Trish stares full of fear into
those horrible eyes

Eyes that close as another deep inhale commences They open
again -abruptly Stares at her a moment longer and tosses her
aside

The Creature instantly on Darry Nose to nose A big deep
inhale as little brother watches Tries to find his sister
somewhere on the floor His whisper like a child’s

DARRY
Please let me smell bad
Please let me smell bad
Trish

Another long inhale This time the Creature’s head drops
back

Darry can see the nostrils Flaring Fluttering Nostrils
don’t flutter
JEEPERS CREEPERS 98

They do it again As if the scent they were sampling sent
his nostrils into uncontrollable twitching

There can be no doubt as the Creature levels those eyes at
Darry -that it has found what it wants Something about or
inside him it finds irresistible

DARRY
Its gonna eat me Trish
This motherfucker’s gonna eat
me

CLINK CLANK RIFLES BEING COCKED BIG ONES

The Creature halts but doesn’t turn The shattered window to
the other room is filled with FOUR OFFICERS IN RIOT GEAR The
Sergeant their leader

DESK SERGEANT
Step away from the kid

The Creature still doesn’t move Stares at Darry

DESK SERGEANT

with your sister

Darry stares at the Creature for a long moment Then slowly
inches down the wall The Creature watching him

Once out from under him Darry scrambles to Trish and they
fly out the door into the hall The Creature turns toward
them but all rifles raise

The Creature slowly raises his head -eyes glaring at them
from an angry furrowed brow that seems to say Who in the
fuck do you think you are

The Creature roars toward them and the guns blaze

INT POHO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT STAIRWELL NIGHT SAME TIME

AS THE SOUNDS OF A WAR RAGE OVERHEAD Trish and Darry
scramble down a stairwell that empties into the dark lobby

Halted by the bodies scattered everywhere Like a massacre
ONE BODY sticking half out a plexi-glass window he was thrown
through

A BODY at the corner of the Sergeant’s desk is just a torso
His bottom half no where to be seen
JEEPERS CREEPERS 99

Trish and Darry blast forward Sprinting through the
atrocities and toward the entrance The glass doors -also
shattered by AN OFFICER’S BODY hanging half in and out

They step over him and out to the parking lot

EXT POHO COUNTY SHERIFF’S BLDG EXT NIGHT SAME TIME

Trish and Darry searching frantically for their car They see
Jezelle’s Winnebago But not a sign of their own vehicle No
way to drive out of here

Except for the Creature’s black van still idling in the
corner of the lot

MORE GUNSHOT BLASTS and flashes from the second story

To Darry the choice is simple He is sprinting toward the
van

TRISH
No

Little brother sprints to the driver door and throws it open
A STENCH SO FOUL meets him that he has to grimace Thinks
twice about this now

DARRY
I am not doing this Darry

KA-TASSSHHHH TWO OFFICERS COME CRASHING OUT A SECOND

DARRY (cont’d)

Before their bodies can even hit the ground Darry braves the
stench Leaps up into the driver’s seat Reaches
instinctively for the ignition No key The van is running
without a key in the ignition

Clutches the gear shift Sticky Looks at his palm Sticky
congealed crimson goo

Its like a thin film over everything

The passenger door flies open Trish reaching out for
brother’s hand Halting with the stench Staring at him

He just gives her arm a good yank and she is up and flying
into the seat The van rattling with her weight And sounding
like a windchime
JEEPERS CREEPERS 100

They look behind them and see why the van walls are lined
with an incredible and grizzly array of spears axes and
knives

All hanging from mounted hooks -THE WEAPONS CLANKING AND
TINKLING TOGETHER WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE VAN

Blades all stained by an eternity of atrocities
The Creature appears now On the roof of the building Darry
staring in horror at him from the van window Even at this
distance caught in his terrifying demon-blind glare
TRISH

What the Hell are you waiting

for
Darry grapples the sticky gear shift again -tries to get it
in first THE GEARS GRIND -SHRIEKING AS IF THEY WERE SOULS
BEING TORTURED

The Creature vaults forward Leaping impossibly off the roof
of the building and onto the roof of Jezelle’s Winnebago

Landing on his feet Glaring at Darry Starting across the
parking lot

Not on the ground He has leapt into the air and is leaping
from police car roof to police car roof with each stride

DARRY
Hang on

Damned gears They grind away
Trish staring back -the Creature leaping from car to car like
some nightmare gymnast Its tattered coat flapping like dark

distressed wings

Darry finally forces the gearshift forward Doesn’t know if
he’s in first or not Guns it

It lurches roughly and stops Must be in second

The Creature hits one final car top and vaults into space-
directly at them

TRISH
Darry

The van lurches forward again Moving now but not fast
JEEPERS CREEPERS 101

KE--RONKKK The Creature smacks into the side of the van
His face rearing up into Darry’s window Staring in Darry
terrified Still trying to get up speed

DARRY
Give me something

Trish out of her seat The van lurching again Throws her
into the back Tries to keep her balance SPEARS AND BATTLE
AXES CLANGING ALL AROUND HER

The Creature rakes his claw-like fingers across the glass in
a circular motion Slicing into it with A HORRIBLE SHRIEKING
SOUND

DARRY
Get me something

The Creature rears his hand back -ready to strike the circle
he has scored in the glass

DARRY
Trish-

Something smacks into the palm of Darrys hand He doesn’t
even take time to see what it is Just swings it at the
window hard

KER-TASSHHH He hits the Creature directly in the face
with a small combination hatchethammer

Glass flying out everywhere as the Creature drops off the
van Crashing to earth as Darry speeds away

DARRY
Trish watching Wants to smile too Shout with joy like her
brother
DARRY
(shouting into the
rearview)
But instead Trish stares out the back windows of the van

Watching the dazed Creature raising his head Staring after
them as they get further and further away

Darry guns the engine The van is really moving now Roaring
away from the Sheriff’s building and down the empty two lane
JEEPERS CREEPERS 102

TRISH
Darry

A warning from sis Brother checks out the rearview the
distant Creature is on his feet now And running

Running toward them

DARRY
(his smile more manic now)
He’s kidding right

In his rearview the Creature sprinting after them Sprinting
like Hell

TRISH
He’s not getting smaller

He is actually gaining on them His legs a blur of darkness
he is coming so fast

Darry checking the speedometer the van is doing 120 miles an
hour And the Creature is gaining on him

You mother

Darry’s foot flattening the gas pedal To the floorboards
The old van shakes and quakes at this velocity THE SPEARS
AND AXES CLANKING NOISILY

Then another impossible nightmare the sprinting Creature
without slowing down- throws himself forward like an acrobat
doing a running tumble--

But when he completes his flip -landing on his feet again- he
uses the momentum to push off And in an affront to gravity
everywhere rockets himself up into the night sky

Up and gone Out of view Brother and sister both saw it
Look to each other

WHOMP SOMETHING HITS THE ROOF OF THE VAN HARD AFFECTS
THE VAN’S TRAJECTORY IT WEAVES ACROSS THE ROAD DARRY TRYING
TO WIN BACK CONTROL

KA-RANKK The Creatures battle axe punches a hole in the
top of the van right in front of Darry’s face

DARRY
Trish

She scrambles for one of the spears Grabs a shorter one
Thrusts it straight up Over her brother’s head
JEEPERS CREEPERS 103

THWAAMMPPPP Pierces the roof and puncture’s the
creature’s head Directly above the eyes

The Creature loses his grip on the van slides back and off
falling onto the road again

Darry watching in the rearview

DARRY
Yes

Hits the asphalt hard The spear dislodges as it rolls over
and over down the two lane

DARRY
Yessss

Rolls and rolls and suddenly leaps up lands on his feet and
keeps on coming

Darry’s enthusiasm gone Just watches breathless as this
inhuman thing comes at them again

The Creature has never moved faster So fast powder is coming
off his skin a skin being eaten away by the actual wind
shear at this velocity

DARRY
Yeah Burn your ass up you son-
of-a-bitch

He is like a comet now -a rocket of dust blasting down the
highway toward the van

TRISH
Watch it

Trish scrambling for another weapon

THE CREATURE’S VELOCITY IS MAKING ITS OWN HISSING SOUND
Brother and sister listening to it grow LOUDER AND LOUDER

Trish with an angry looking battle axe at the ready Sees the
SCREAMING dust storm is almost upon them

KA-POOOMMM The back doors blast inward as the Creature
explodes into the van

Trish thrown ahead against the dash Darry losing control
again The van hits the shoulder of the road hard

Inside the Creature advances Trish lurching forward with an
axe at the ready for him She swings it
JEEPERS CREEPERS 104

THWOCK HIS HEAD IS NEATLY SLICED OFF Leaves a small puff
of dust at his neck as it rolls right out the back of the van
and down the highway

The Creature’s headless body staggering back Trish staring
at it Charges ahead with the same weapon and hurls it
Direct hit Knocks the torso back out the doors

It hits the asphalt hard and goes rolling and rolling in
sporadic puffs of dust

DARRY
Yes

The van roars ahead In the distance A TRAIN WHISTLE Darry
listening to it Looks at his sister

DARRY
Where is he

Trish takes no time to stare out the windows again

TRISH
He’s dead He doesn’t have a
head

DARRY
He’s not

TRISH

Darry He doesn’t have a
fucking head

DARRY
He’s not

TRISH
How’s he supposed to eat any
thing without a head

Brother and sister staring breathless at each other Darry’s
words are calm now Almost whispered

DARRY
He’s not gonna stop
(emphatically)
He is never gonna stop

Trish

The Railway crossing ahead The CLANKING SOUND of the WARNING
BELLS and the Automatic arms

DARRY
Get out
JEEPERS CREEPERS 105

She can’t believe he said this

DARRY
I mean it get out
(off her incredulous look)
Theres grass over there

TRISH
He’s dead

DARRY
He’s not We both know he’s
not

THE TRAIN HORN BLASTS NOW A warning it is almost to the
crossing

DARRY
Do it
WHOMP SOMETHING AGAIN HITS THE ROOF HARD THEY BOTH LOOK
TO EACH OTHER
DARRY
TRISH
TRISH
What the Hell’re you gonna
do
KA-RANNKKK Down comes the Creature’s hand again making a

larger hole in the roof of the van grappling for Darry’s
head

It finds him Holds on tight Darry screaming Trish races
forward

TRISH
Look out

She swings the axe again THWOMP The hand grappling her
brother is severed It falls to the ground and she kicks it
out the back of the van

It hits hard in a cloud of dust

Up top the armless headless Creature reaches down again
with his one remaining arm

DARRY
Goddammit Trish I’m not doing
this for nothing-
JEEPERS CREEPERS 106

TRISH
You’re not doing anything
without me

She takes another long sharp spear and thrusts it through the
roof of the van

Up top the spear-head pierces the Creature’s headless torso
pinning it to the top of the van

This makes him more angry His remaining arm reaching down
for Darry -grapples with new violence for his head Finds it

Darry trying to wrench it off him It starts to pull him
upward

Trish runs forward with her axe but little brother surprises
her Grabs her arm and pulls her onto his lap

TRISH
Darry

Forces the axe out of her hand Kicks open his door Looks
terrified as he flashes a last look at her

DARRY
Bye sis-

Throws his sister out of the van She screams as she hits
soft grass and rolls and rolls

The train is upon them WARNING BELLS DEAFENING LIGHTS
FLASHING

And Darry clutching the arm of the Creature as tight as he
can The creature lifting him -up out of his seat

Darry fighting it Bracing himself with his hands against the
roof of the van

DARRY
You got me You got me you son-of-
a-bitch Huh

THE VAN ROARS THROUGH THE RAILWAY CROSSING BREAKING THROUGH
THE AUTOMATIC ARMS

Trish in the grass stunned Looking out The van on a
collision course with the oncoming train

TRISH
JEEPERS CREEPERS 107

THE TRAIN ROARS AHEAD -ITS WHISTLE BLASTING AS THE VAN
REACHES THE TRACKS AT THE SAME MOMENT

The headless Creature struggling Darry clutching it’s arm -
helping it to remain impaled to the roof of the van as--

KA-BLAMMMMMM THE TRAIN SMASHES INTO THEM

THE VAN CONCAVES IMMEDIATELY RUPTURING THE GAS TANK AND
EXPLODING IN A SAVAGE BALL OF FIRE THAT SENDS ROCKETS OF
SMOKE AND FLAME LAUNCHING OUT OF THE INFERNO IN ALL
DIRECTIONS

Trish is already crying Sobbing as the blast lights her
bruised and bleeding face

It is raining debris now Fiery debris and bits and pieces of
cloth and metal

But nothing human Nothing inhuman for that matter Trish
stares ahead from the grass Sobs Inconsolable in the tall
grass

SLOW DISSOLVE TO

EXT TRAIN CROSSING MORNING TWO HOURS LATER

Trish in a police car In the back seat Wrapped in a
blanket Still in shock Workers sifting through the ash and
debris of what lay across the tracks

Jezelle knocks on the window Trish rolls it down

JEZELLE
Your parents are waiting for
you back at the Sheriffs
Building I heard it on the
scanner

Trish doesn’t look at her Just stares out Jezelle draws a
breath and starts to step away

TRISH
Your dreams are wrong

Jezelle stops Turns and looks at her
TRISH
Sometimes Darry didnt die

like you said he would

JEZELLE
Sometimes
JEEPERS CREEPERS 108

Jezelle nods in silent agreement Though there is something
in her eyes we cannot discern

She turns away Moves toward her Winnebago Trisha looking
on

Somewhere we hear the tune Jeeper’s Creeper’s Instrumental
version Playful Strange in this grim context as we

SLOW DISSOLVE TO

EXT OLD PACKING PLANT LATE DAY

Somewhere off that same country two lane in the long shadows
of the dying sun this old packing plant sits It is rusted
and sagging and as we approach and our music continues we
begin moving down

Down toward the ground beneath the old structure

INT OLD PACKING PLANT BASEMENT LEVEL NIGHT

In dank darkness the music continues Sounds like its
playing on a phonograph somewhere Yes a phonograph The old
kind with lots of analog hiss We move toward the music
along an empty wall

At the end of which in the long shadows a tall figure ina
cape-like coat busies himself Though we can’t tell with what
until we are up close

Sewing Stitching Fingers working nimbly with coarse black
thread

We see now the wall is not entirely empty Several bodies are
mounted there Not the ancient dead we have seen underground
at the church

These are fresher Of much more recent demise Sewn together
in the same grizzly fashion we know too well

And then KER-PLUNK A new body is hung next to them Hung on
a hook which we cannot see

Young Darry Eye lids sewn shut with large nasty looking
stitches The latest addition in this new mural of human
horrors
JEEPERS CREEPERS 109

The instrumental bridge of the song ends and the lyrics echo
in this vast underground chamber

--Jeepers Creepers where’d you get those Peepers Jeepers
Creepers where’d you get those eyes

Echoing as we begin to back away from this sad and grizzly
sight the Creature beginning to sew Darry onto the others

As this begins WE SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK as our song continues

--Jeepers Creepers where’d you get those Peepers Jeepers
Jeepers Weepers Creepers where did you get those eyes
