OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS
INT MIRANDA AND DOUGS BEDROOM - DAWN

PUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark The ALARM
CLOCK reads 559 AM The womans eyes open a second
before the alarm beeps and turns it off She grabs a
glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it
Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs
(wedding vacation etc) This is MIRANDA GREY 30
sharp and prettier than she knows

INT GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING

Miranda slides through the water Swimming cap on
goggles Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the
water Something unsettling about this sound Something
slightly unsettling too about her detached manner A
person on autopilot recognizing only the water and the
perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path Like
graphic metaphors for her own conscience flat She
emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself
in a towel

INT COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING

Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Mirandas husband DOUGLAS GREY (older a superficial
analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast
Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case
file He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the
newspaper A pleasant domestic scene Its 800 AM

EXT ST ANNES HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING
Mirandas Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps
Doug kisses his wife and hops out Exemplary carpoolers

INT WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDAS OFFICE - EVENING

Stark walls Simple decor Bookshelves packed with the
according psychiatric tomes and diplomas Miranda faces
a troubled young mess of a woman CHLOE charismatic
deranged and forever trying to provoke Mid-session

MIRANDA
This is your stepfather who came
to visit you

CHLOE
My stepfather No Hes dead
(beat)
I killed him

Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough
Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist

MIRANDA
Thats the first time you admit
it

CHLOE
So Theres a first time for
everything

MIRANDA
(jotting this down)
It means youre finally past the
denial stage This is good
Chloe

CHLOE
I never killed anyone who didnt
deserve it

MIRANDA
You only killed your stepfather as

CHLOE

mother She knew all along You

MIRANDA

on track)
Lets get back to your visitor

CHLOE
The Devil
MIRANDA

Alright the Devil Why would the
Devil visit you Its already
hell in here what would he have
to gain

CHLOE
He came to fuck an angel
(giggles at that)

Im his dirty angel

Before Miranda can analyze that one the room LIGHTS FLICKER
AND DIE Darkness Mirandas breathing speeds up

CHLOE
He grabbed me by the hair while I
sucked him and usually I love
that I just do -- maybe you can
tell me why I love it so much --
but not this time he was just too
rough --

As suddenly as it went out now the POWER RETURNS A
visibly uncomfortable Miranda checks the clock

MIRANDA
Thats it until Monday Try and
get some sleep tonight okay

CHLOE
Sure Doctor
(leans in)
Crazy people hear messages from
God Not the Devil You know
that right
( )

MIRANDA
I didnt say you were crazy

CHLOE
You dont have to say it

She almost doesnt seem crazy when she says this
Almost TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door Miranda nods
for them to escort Chloe Chloe shakes their hands away
from her strides off dramatically The princess of the
asylum

INT WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

Miranda locks her office armed with paperwork The end
of another workweek DR PETE GRAHAM a good ten years
older and Mirandas best friend on the job approaches

They walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues
who not only respect each other but enjoy each other A
lot

PETE
Power went out again in our wing

MIRANDA
(knows whats coming)

They have reached an office marked DR PHILLIP PARSONS
DIRECTOR and peer in to see Parsons (50s
distinguished commands respect from everyone) on the
phone He gestures for Pete to sit Miranda is about to
exit when he covers the mouthpiece --

PARSONS

Parsons looks through his appointment book

( )

He nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone
call

EXT WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT

Miranda drives off leaving the majestic grounds behind
A GUARD waves her off

END OPENING CREDITS

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up
ahead A knocked-down telephone post blocks the road
EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene A patrolman waves her
down

INT MIRANDAS CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
SHERIFF RYAN 40S recognizes her and ambles over

MIRANDA

SHERIFF RYAN

MIRANDA

phone call

MIRANDA

He taps on her hood and heads back to the site She
shifts into reverse and makes a U-turn

EXT OLD MAIN ROAD - NIGHT

Miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge
Something definitely creepy about this deserted place --

INT MIRANDAS CAR - MOVING

Miranda dials a number on her cell phone gets the
machine

MIRANDA

A bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the
passenger seat She reaches for it and when she looks up
we see

POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

A TEENAGE GIRL stands smack in front of us Naked
About to get pummelled by us

BACK TO SCENE

Miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing
METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain control of the
car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT --

She looks in her rearview mirror the girl is standing
back there Drunk or high or in any case completely out
of it

MIRANDA
(into phone)
Stay on the line Dont go
anywhere The weirdest thing
just --
(the phone cuts out)
Hello Hello

( )

She stares at the dead phone Punches the buttons on it
No go

MIRANDA
Wonderful

She tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car

EXT ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

Miranda cautiously approaches the girl who is now not
moving Just standing there Her back to us

MIRANDA
Hello Are you hurt Hello

Nothing As we get closer we see she is covered in
bruises Clearly something horrible has happened to her

MIRANDA
Were you in an accident Were you
attacked Its okay Im a doctor
(beat)
My name is Miranda Grey

And now she turns Young seventeen tops Busted lip
black eye Miranda pulls off her coat wraps it around
the girl --

MIRANDA
Youre in shock right now thats
perfectly natural Im going to
get you to the hospital Okay

The girl suddenly grips Mirandas arm Hard

MIRANDA
Dont be scared Its going to be
fine

Now the girl is touching Mirandas face Her movements
desperate smothering Like the movements of a drowning
person Miranda tries to push the girls hands back down

MIRANDA
Hands off me okay Tell me your
name do you remember your name

The girl tries to speak but no words come out Instead
she produces a strained wettish sound Creepy as hell
And now she is prying Mirandas mouth open and shes much
stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --

( )

MIRANDA
What are you doing Im trying to
help you --

The girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake And as
Miranda muffles a scream blood starts leaking out of the
girls eye sockets and from wounds all over her body

SLAM CUT TO

INT BEDROOM - DAWN

Miranda wakes up in a cold sweat Just a bad dream A
beat

FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER we hear a REPETITIVE
SOUND outside Like an ECHO of some sort but vaguely
familiar THWIP THWIP THWIP

Miranda takes a deep breath reaches for the glass of
water on her bedside table Except its not there
She turns to her husband but hes not in the bed And
now she glances around the room and realizes this is not
her bedroom

She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark Trips over
something A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY Her heartbeat
goes haywire She feels her way along the wall to a
small opening in the door A glass pane

She peers through the glass at the empty corridor
outside realizing what this must mean realizing shes
inside a cell

She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door frantic --
MIRANDA
Hello Somebody help me

EXT WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

CAMERA SOARS through the tall iron gates past the guard
Now we spot the source of our continuing THWIP THWIP
sound sprinklers watering the impressively-kept gardens
The expansive complex is more Victorian campus than drab

prison with separate wings (male and female) research
units libraries gym and volunteer outpatient center

INT WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS

A bored group of female patients listen to a social
worker lecturing them A janitor mops a long corridor
Patients study at the library under the watchful eye of
orderlies

A doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an
epileptic fit (well soon know her as SHELLEY) They
force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing
her tongue prepare a syringe

Institute director Phil Parsons at a meeting with other
doctors discussing a patients progress on a chart

Now we are MOVING up the main buildings wall and THROUGH
large windows into --

INT FEMALE WING STAIRS

Pete rushes up two steps at a time passing by a NURSE
WITH A CART OF MEDS who nods respectfully as he goes --

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDAS CELL

An ORDERLY unlocks the door for Pete Through the glass
pane he can see a visibly upset Miranda arguing with the
head nurse a tough as nails woman in her 50s IRENE

ORDERLY 1
Sleeping beauty is awake

Peter forces a smile enters --

INT MIRANDAS CELL

MIRANDA
Peter what the hell is going on

Pete nods at Irene its okay hell take it from here

PETE
How do you feel

MIRANDA
How do you think I feel Is this
a joke

Peter is half-listening to her half-signaling to the
nurse with the meds to come in Miranda catches all of
this growing more agitated She wears the uniform all
patients wear a white T-shirt and sweats Her wedding
ring is gone

( )

MIRANDA
What are you doing

PETE
Giving you something to calm down

MIRANDA
I dont need to calm down What I
need is an explanation

Pete grabs the meds from the nurse Irene and the
attendant step closer to help Miranda feels them
closing in on her Peters tone is infuriatingly gentle

PETE
Just take this and we can sit down
and chat

MIRANDA

Why here why not in my office

She looks at the silent faces around her No sympathy
Or maybe too much sympathy Either way its unnerving

MIRANDA
I dont want an anticonvulsant at
least give me Valium

PETE
(nods at nurse)
Fifty milligrams

MIRANDA
Jesus Christ youre gonna knock
me out Ten milligrams

PETE
(final offer)
Twenty

The nurse complies Miranda stares at the meds trying
desperately to put this into some kind of perspective

MIRANDA
How would you feel if you woke up
in a goddamn cell dressed like this

PETE
We can discuss it at length after
you take your meds

Awkward nods from Irene the nurse and the attendant
Pete holds Mirandas gaze Miranda takes her meds

( )

MIRANDA
Okay This better be good

Pete motions for the others to leave them alone One by
one they file out and lock the door behind them

INT MIRANDAS CELL - LATER
Miranda paces Alone with Pete she is even more upset

PETE
Miranda this is very awkward
Technically I shouldnt even be
treating you but the court has
granted us a waiver until youre
transferred So whatever is said
here wont leave this room I
wont tell Parsons I wont tell
anyone

MIRANDA
I want to talk to my husband

PETE
You cant to that Sit down
please Try to relax

MIRANDA
Why would I pretend to be in any
way relaxed

PETE
I understand youre upset But we
need to put some things in order

MIRANDA
Two massive understatements

He hesitates unsure where to begin

PETE
How long have you been here

MIRANDA
(laughs )
What is this Why are you doing
this to me

PETE
Just answer the question Humor

me

( )

MIRANDA
Hi my name is Miranda Grey Ima
psychiatrist I transferred here to

the Woodward Forensic Institute a
little over a year ago My job
entails dealing with a ward of
schizophrenic women between the
ages of eighteen and fifty-fife --

PETE
I dont mean how long youve
worked here I mean how long
youve been staying here

This stops her Wanting desperately to whip out a
comeback but realizing she doesnt know the answer

MIRANDA
Im a doctor yes Or was medical
school just an elaborate dream

PETE
Of course youre a doctor A
great doctor in fact

The hint of sadness in his voice alarms her

MIRANDA
Pete how long have I been here

PETE
Five days

MIRANDA
(barely audible)
What

PETE
You were admitted to the
neurosurgical unit seizing
violently That lasted three
days Scans revealed left-sided
weakness numbness and severe
fontal lobe deficits

Miranda shakes her head in disbelief but we --

FLASHBACK - INT NEUROSURGICAL UNIT

Miranda seizing violently FROM HER POV Doctors
struggling to contain her Arms thrashing legs

negative for PCP underwent
extensive hypnosis and received
amytal injections

FLASH Miranda being tied down A nurse with a
syringe --

INT MIRANDAS CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)
She looks down at her wrists with the reddish marks

PETE

You were tied down for a day and a
half so you wouldnt hurt yourself
and then you went into a state of
well --

(how to put this)
Youve been pretty much catatonic

(beat)
This is the first time you speak

Miranda speechless Reality sinking in

MIRANDA
Doug must be worried sick I need
to call him --

Pete shakes his head emphatically

PETE
Youre the most logical person I
know bar none Plus you have a
photographic memory -- unconfirmed
but you do remember events and
phrases more accurately than anyone
around Why am I telling you this

MIRANDA
Youre establishing my personality
as fairly intellectual you dont
consider me impulsive or emotional

PETE
And thats a fair assessment no

MIRANDA
Yes thats fair And following
this pattern of analysis were
about to discuss a traumatic event
that rendered this psychological
profile useless correct
( )

PETE
Two hundred percent

A pause here Hes waiting for her to continue Shes
not used to being on the other side of the therapists
table

MIRANDA
You think Im in denial That Im
putting on a brave show -- that

this is a ‘cover for some
unbearable emotion Im hiding
Why

PETE
Dont analyze yourself just focus
on remembering

MIRANDA

I remember Friday night after
work if you say that was five
days ago --

(pushing on)
Anyway I asked you what you were
doing for the weekend and you said
the usual and you made a joke
about writing country songs and
drinking yourself to sleep and I
told you I was going to look at
some real estate in Willows Creek
with Doug

PETE
And then what

MIRANDA
Then I drove home

PETE
And then what

MIRANDA

I got home I guess and had
dinner by myself because --

(pauses struggling)
Because Doug had an alumni meeting
at his school and he was going to
get a ride back Hes the
principal now as you well know

She stops here Pete waits The silence is deafening
She pushes on but her hands shake a little

( )

MIRANDA
But wait -- there was an accident
before that wasnt there A girl
-- she had been beaten I took
her to the hospital right

PETE
There was indeed an accident you
were detoured by the cops But
theres no report of any girl

MIRANDA
No the cops werent there They
were back on Main Road A
knocked-down telephone post
correct
Pete nods Miranda is all foggy on the details

Frustrated she snatches his cell phone and starts to
dial

MIRANDA

wrong with Doug

PETE

This stops her cold Time stands eerily still She
stares at Pete as if by looking at him long enough he
will contradict his statement

INT MIRANDA AND DOUGS HOUSE - NIGHT

A breathless Miranda wipes her face leaving a thick
streak of blood on it She looks down at her hand
noticing the blood -- and now we are back in --

INT MIRANDAS CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Miranda wakes up with a start The darkness renders the
room almost void of any color Monochromatic It takes
her a moment to orient herself Her eyes wander across

the unfamiliar room feeling like shes being watched

We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound Like
somebody is standing over her bed But we dont see
anything Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks
through the glass partition into the empty corridor She
glances back at the room stills seeing nothing -- and
bangs on the door

( )

MIRANDA
Can I get some assistance here
Hello

She waits Bangs on the door again

MIRANDA
Irene Anybody

A beat And now finally we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING
A light is switched on down the corridor

The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER and CLOSER

Miranda tries to appear composed Wipes sweat off her
forehead Fixes her hair The FOOTSTEPS now STOP right
out side the door A KEY goes into the lock and JIGGLES
it

Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens
Confused she steps up to the glass partition and
peeks --

The second her face touches the glass she is met by a
pair of piercing eyes The eerie teenage girl Miranda
jumps back screams

And when she looks up again the image is gone A beat
Rational thought kicking in --

MIRANDA

(to self)
Wake up wake up

(beat)
Youre dreaming Its not real
An anxiety dream thats all
Thats all This is dream logic
If it was real they would have
heard you scream There are
twenty employees on the night
shift Fact At least twenty

She props herself with her back against the wall With a
view of the whole cell Just in case Staring at the
door

MIRANDA
Im just dreaming

And now FAINTLY at first but GROWING LOUDER --

FOOTSTEPS can be heard APPROACHING outside Just like
before

( )

MIRANDA
Im dreaming Im dreaming Im
dreaming Im dreaming

Like her life depends on that mantra The FOOTSTEPS get
CLOSER And her voice begins to falter --

MIRANDA
(voice rising)
Im dreaming Im dreaming --

And now the FOOTSTEPS pause outside her door like before
and she holds her breath horrified when suddenly we are
hit with the sudden glare of returning light

EVERYTHING FLASHES WHITE and then COLOR RETURNS --

IRENE (0S)

INT MIRANDAS CELL - DAY

Irene tries to shake Miranda awake An orderly and nurse

Irene shoves the meds into Mirandas mouth --

MIRANDA

She struggles as they hold her down and Irene sedates
her

CAMERA FOLLOWS HER INTENT GAZE to another patient
SHELLEY (the same patient we saw earlier mid-fit)
moseying across the room Nervously takes a seat beside
Miranda

SHELLEY
Hi there Doc

It takes a moment for the heavily-drugged Miranda to
react She looks up slowly eyes glazed painfully out
of it

SHELLEY

I never got shrinked by you but

all I hear is nothing gets past

you I mean thats just hearsay
and I dont pay much attention to
hearsay because now they say you
hacked your husband with an axe

but I say maybe it just slipped

right

( )

Miranda notices Shelley is toying with a wrinkled
NEWSPAPER CLIPPING Shelley catches this look and slides
it over to her Without malice like a child

SHELLEY
They put your picture in the

paper

It reads SCHOOL PRINCIPAL SLAUGHTERED WIFE UNDER
ARREST Photos of Miranda Douglas their house

Miranda stares at it in disbelief Growing sick

MIRANDA
How did you get this

SHELLEY
Chloe did Who knows how Not
me Around here Im on a need to
know basis about stuff and most
stuff I dont need to know My
point is about people talking
behind other peoples backs Like
before I was here everything I
did I thought this1ll get them
wanting their approval wanting
them to say good things behind my
back But now Im more anonymous
more myself Im Shelley

Miranda slides the clipping back to Shelley clueless as
to how to get out of this conversation but Shelley has
no problem holding a conversation all by herself --

SHELLEY
Youre not like undercover here
are you They pulled that at
Spring Grove had a bunch of
doctors pretend they were
patients see if they could handle
it Most quit after day one
Youre not are you

MIRANDA
No Shelley Im not undercover

SHELLEY
Because if you were Im like the
Fort Knox of secrets Ask
anybody

MIRANDA
Thats good to know But Im not

( )

SHELLEY
Say no more
(sotto)
I understand perfectly

She hands Miranda paper and some crayons whispers

SHELLEY
Drawing is a great cover Good
luck to you

With a wink shes gone Miranda looks at the room
around her Chloe spying on her in the corner Irene and
the nurse sharing a laugh other patients ambling about
arguing --

Life among the insane

INT LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA —- DAY

Patients undress in the bare-bones locker area An
uneasy Miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by
Irene

MIRANDA

I dont -- I think Im alright
IRENE

You go in last because youre

special

(off Mirandas look)
Its not a Mexican prison toots
Everybody here minds their own

business

MIRANDA
If its all the same Id
rather --

IRENE

State law says we keep you ladies
clean And Im a stickler for the
law

(beat)
Now come on If you go downtown
you gotta dance

Miranda studies the patients already under the spray of
the shower Something vaguely concentration camp-like
about institutional bathing

( )

The shower like everything else in this place is
regulated by shifts so that various groupings of
patients each get their turn Miranda feels Chloes gaze
on her across the room She is stripping off her clothes
for Mirandas benefit gleefully mangling the last
refrain from the Stones START ME UP

IRENE
(checking watch)
Thats five minutes group one
(to Chloes group)
Alright ladies nice and easy

The first group of bathers file out dripping wet past
Miranda in all shapes and sizes She registers their
many scars and tattoos like maps of troubled souls
names of men places religious quotes Burn scars
cuts needle marks They begin to towel off as Miranda
slowly and painfully self-conscious begins to undress in
the corner

A moment later Irene nods for her to go in

INT COMMUNAL SHOWERS - LATER

Miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her
eyes trying to shut it all out

The SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda
and her RAGGED BREATHING Chloe and Shelley the last
two out from the previous group grab towels

Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring but
Miranda is not staring at her She is staring past her
at the tile wall

More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted
water pipe pokes out Clearly at some point there was a
handle there but now it is just a hole with a busted
pipe

PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of
blood emerge following by a GURGLING sound which seems
to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system

The blood lingers tentatively as if unfamiliar with the
laws of gravity before tracing an upward line along the
tile The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER CLOSER and now more
blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall

Miranda looks away disturbed and now realizes she is
the only one left in the showers Panic Shuts her
eyes

( )

MIRANDA
(to self)
It isnt real It isnt real

Opens her eyes
Five letters are written in blood N-O-T-A-L

Shaking nauseous she looks down at her feet and the
drain too scared to look back up

MIRANDA
(to self)
It isnt real Youre
hallucinating

Perhaps But now blood drips by her ankle DRIP DRIP
DRIP And the shooting pain she feels is coming from her
arm What the hell -- WE SEE SHARP SLASHES appearing
on her skin like some invisible knife is slicing her

Hallucination or not she bolts out of the showers --

INT LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA

Miranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm too freaked
out to process anything Fumbles for her clothes and heads
straight to Shelley tying her shoelaces muttering

MIRANDA
Shelley

SHELLEY
And pick up those damn cigarette
butts Jesus TV is dumb --

MIRANDA
Shelley can you do me a favor

Shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look

SHELLEY
The housewives will find something
better to do

MIRANDA
Can you go in the shower and tell
me if you see anything on the wall

Shelley doesnt respond Simply crosses over and heads
for the showers Miranda gets dressed when a hand on her
shoulder makes her jump --

( )

IRENE
Enough privacy for you

MIRANDA
Yes Thank you Irene

But now Irene notices the blood seeping through the
towel

IRENE
What did you do

MIRANDA
Nothing Its nothing --

IRENE
What the hell did you do to
yourself

And now the other patients are curiously watching as
orderlies RUSH IN to haul her away

INT WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

THROUGH a glass pane we see a NURSE bandaging Mirandas
arm Parsons and Irene confer just outside the room

IRENE
I looked away for a second Its
unacceptable wont happen again

PARSONS
Not your fault Patients always
find a way to hurt themselves if
thats what they want

IRENE

I just didnt peg her for a

cutter thats all
Parsons watches Miranda through the glass She cant
look him in the eye
INT REC ROOM - LATER
Miranda (with her fresh new bandage) ignores the looks
from the other patients as she rejoins them Spots

Shelley by the window furthest from the wardens Scared

SHELLEY
Oh my God Oh my God

( )

MIRANDA
You saw it

SHELLEY
Listen Doctor Some people they
have a gift And in here because
they categorize us as a bunch of
schizos they refuse to
acknowledge that Its like that
Hubble telescope that sees things
a trillion miles away but what
its seeing is just reflected
light of a star that died a
thousand years ago Its like
that Doesnt mean youre crazy
It only means your eyes open in a
different way

Miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation but
has a sinking feeling

MIRANDA
What did it say

SHELLEY
On the telescope

MIRANDA
Did you see anything Shelley

Shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear

SHELLEY
Thats not tile that wall is made
out of Its a holographic

screen All part of your mission
isnt it

Miranda shakes her head feeling foolish Walks away

MIRANDA
Thanks anyway

SHELLEY
(taps her forehead)

This is all we have The rest is
dust

INT MIRANDAS CELL - DAY
Pete and Miranda stare at each other A tense beat

( )

MIRANDA
It was you I called that night

PETE
Yes

MIRANDA
Did you mention that to the cops

PETE
No

MIRANDA
Why

PETE

I didnt think it would help you

MIRANDA
What does that mean

PETE
It means they wouldnt have let me
treat you if they thought I had
any kind of involvement in what

happened

MIRANDA
And did you

PETE
Did I what

MIRANDA

Did I make it to your place Did
I see you that night

PETE
No We got disconnected and I
couldnt get through to you I
sat there waiting all night
Figured youd changed your mind

MIRANDA
Why didnt you tell me this before

PETE
Because the only way youll be
able to accept these events is if
you remember them on your own My
job is to assist you in processing
that information because youre
not in a frame of mind to do it by
yourself

( )

She stares at him Queasy

MIRANDA
Youre changing the subject

PETE
The subject is you dont trust me

MIRANDA
Right now I dont trust anyone

She tries to read his face Reminds herself of who Pete

is and what he means to her He points at her bandaged
arm

PETE
You want to talk about today

She takes a resigned breath slowly shakes her head
Wishing she could wake up from this nightmare

MIRANDA
I want to talk to my lawyer

PETE
I think thats premature

MIRANDA
I cant help what you think

FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXT WOODWARD INSTITUTE GARDEN - DAY

SPRINKLER SYSTEMS doing their thing THWIP THWIP
THWIP The female patients are out in the gardens for

their freshly dose of air BOOM DOWN TO Miranda alone at

a bench A cigarette appears before her being offered
to her

JENNA
You a Marlboro girl

Miranda sees Jenna looming above her shielding the sun

MIRANDA
I dont smoke thanks

( )

JENNA

All we have is our health
cupcake

(sits beside her)
What I do is quit constantly
start again Drives them all
crazy One day I quit three
times

MIRANDA
Huh

Jenna lights her smoke blows out the match slowly
Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna
rambles on

JENNA
They allow me one match at a time
and pretend theyre not watching
Check it out salivating goon
number one at three oclock oh-
so-inconspicuous goon number two
at five oclock

Miranda follows Jennas gaze Sure enough shes being
closely watched by two orderlies

MIRANDA
What did you set on fire to wind
up here

JENNA

Very perceptive Doc I burnt
down the building where I worked
I found a baby at the doorstep
called the cops -- of course the
bottom feeding pricks never
showed Its beside the point
really

Miranda shrugs God knows what Jenna is talking about
but who is she to say Once again Miranda checks the
building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge She
rises --

MIRANDA
Phil

He keeps walking Headed to the parking lot beyond

MIRANDA
Phil

( )

He turns His first instinct is to smile But he checks
himself reminding himself of her new status Slips into

his best professional face

PARSONS
Hello Miranda

MIRANDA
I wonder if I could talk to you

PARSONS
Of course
(checks his watch)
Well actually Im about to

MIRANDA
Your staff meetings done and
Thursdays you dont schedule
sessions until the afternoon
This will just take one minute
Promise

Impressive She remembers his schedule perfectly

PARSONS
True
(points )
But the Sheriff wants to ask me
some questions

She follows his look to the parking lot where Sheriff
Ryan emerges from his patrol car Miranda nods

MIRANDA
Its about Pete

PARSONS
What about him

MIRANDA
Perhaps hes not the most
qualified person to be treating
me

His tone is fatherly yet direct
PARSONS
Are you complaining about his
methods or are you referring to
the nature of your past
relationship with him

This surprises her

( )

MIRANDA
What did he tell you

PARSONS
He explained there might be a
conflict of interest because he
has feelings for you You two
engaged in a kiss at one point
Am I right

MIRANDA
Yes

PARSONS
I told him were all grownups here
and the fact is hes the best doctor
on my staff As such and given the
severity of the charges you face I
consider him the most qualified person
to assist your recovery Now if
youll excuse me Sheriff Ryan is
not a patient man

Stonewalled in the simplest of ways shes left feeling
like an idiot Watches Parsons join the Sheriff by his
car The two men shake hands when suddenly Irene runs
past her yelling --

IRENE
Hey Chloe

Now two ORDERLIES race past Miranda looks over to see
what the fuss is all about Chloe is on top of an
institute staff member we havent seen before a round
black woman named CONSUELO Punching her --

Other patients have crowded around the scuffle

CHLOE
You fucking cow giving me the evil
eye huh Fuck you you fuckin
voodoo witch --

Irene and the orderlies yank Chloe off Consuelo Chloe kicks
and screams like an animal Consuelo meekly stands up

CONSUELO
(heavy Cuban accent)
Is okay shes okay -- she dont
mean nothing

CHLOE
You bet your goddamn fat ass I
mean it youre a witch --
( )

IRENE
McGrath thats enough

The orderlies start pulling Chloe away Chloe spits at
Consuelo full of venom

CHLOE
Take your voodoo shit back to
Cuba --

IRENE
I said thats enough

CONSUELO
Irene shes okay Pobrecita la
infeliz Its a misunderstanding
Pobrecita I was only trying to
help her --

CHLOE

You wanna help me You pity me
(grabbing her
crotch)

Suck me

The orderlies haul Chloe off Irene disperses the crowd
Consuelo sighs embarrassed wipes a bloody lip Her
Manner says she just wants to get back to her duties
Excitement over the patients resume whatever it is they
were doing

Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something

catches her eye Pete watching her from his office
window He quickly slides the curtain shut Odd

EXT WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY TO NIGHT (TIME LAPSE
PHOTOGRAPHY SHOTS)

A sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a SWOOSH --

INT WOODWARD CORRIDOR

SLOW PUSH DOWN empty corridors The air thick with dread --

INT MIRANDAS CELL - NIGHT

Miranda cries softly unable to sleep VOICES trickle in
from the corridor outside wardens on their rounds a
SOFT MOAN from another cell a random SCREAM She shuts
her eyes repositions herself on her stomach

( )

As before somebody seems to be watching her

FADE OUT

INT WOODWARD LIBRARY - DAY

Irene escorts Miranda into the library A warden
follows

IRENE
How are we feeling today

MIRANDA
We

IRENE
Sorry I asked

MIRANDA
Doesnt seem like the best choice
of words when treating
schizophrenics

IRENE
Fitting right in arent you

The library is pretty much empty at this hour except for
the LIBRARIAN and the odd janitor tidying up An
efficient-looking man rises from a desk briefcase in
place glass of water -- this is attorney THEODORE
TEDDY HOWARD

TEDDY HOWARD
Miranda

MIRANDA
Hi

Irene checks her watch The warden hangs back keeping
watch

IRENE
Shes due back in the rec room in
twenty Counselor

TEDDY HOWARD
Thank you kindly

Miranda sits Waits until Irene is out of hearing range

( )

MIRANDA
Teddy I know you knew Doug well
and this is an extremely --

TEDDY HOWARD
Im here as your lawyer So
whatever my relationship was with
Doug is no longer of consequence
First things first how are they
treating you

MIRANDA
Like Im crazy

TEDDY HOWARD
You know this place better than
anyone Anything out of the
ordinary

MIRANDA
Other than me being crazy No

TEDDY HOWARD
The DA is pushing for a hearing as
soon as next week Theyre eager
to resolve this situation because
-- well crimes like this dont
happen that often around here
Doug was a hometown boy whod done
good beloved high school
principal a role model Our best

shot -- scratch that our only
shot -- is to claim temporary
insanity

As he speaks she starts fidgeting with her itchy
bandage

MIRANDA
Wait wait wait -- Teddy you
know me I wouldnt raise a hand
at my husband for the life of me
Not even in self-defense Isnt
it remotely possible a burglar
broke in or some crazed high
school student attacked Doug and I
went into shock

Teddy shakes his head
MIRANDA
Youre telling me theres no other

suspects in anyones mind

( )

TEDDY HOWARD
Frankly no Neighbors heard
screams They have you at the
scene they have the murder weapon
and they have your prints everywhere
The only thing they dont have is
motive

She keeps absently playing with the bandage The
adhesive is giving The bandage starting to peel off

MIRANDA
Because there is no motive

TEDDY HOWARD
And thats whats confusing them
The fact that youre a brilliant
psychiatrist doesnt help either
It fills their heads with ideas
They figure if you were to plan a
murder you might know how to fake
insanity to get out of it

She pulls off half the bandage back and forth Not
looking BUT WE SEE the beginning of a pattern in her
scarred skin --

MIRANDA
Im not faking anything

TEDDY HOWARD
Good I pass no judgment either
way The point is --

MIRANDA

The point is Im the only person
who doesnt believe I killed my
husband I never thought Id say
this but I feel like Im in the
middle of a conspiracy

(beat)
Do you believe Im crazy

An uncomfortable Teddy takes too long before answering
Miranda looks down humiliated -- and now she sees it
Perfectly carved into her arm her scar reads

NOT ALONE
Petrified Miranda jumps back knocks down Teddys glass
of water all over his papers her chair topples over

The warden and janitor look up --

Teddy tries for delicate
( )

TEDDY HOWARD
It doesnt matter what I believe

MIRANDA
Forget it Forget I asked

PUSH INTO her face as involuntary tears roll down and we --

INT PETES OFFICE - DAY

Miranda Numb Pete trying hard to get through A
beat We get a good look at the writing on her arm
(The right arm)

PETE
I cant help you if you dont talk
to me

Silence from Miranda He is firm but not unkind

PETE
I can stand here all day All
week Youre the one running out
of time

Nothing He goes to touch her arm She jerks it away

PETE
What does it mean

She shakes her head at a loss Torn between her
suspicion and the need to confide in someone Finally

MIRANDA
I didnt write this

PETE
Then who

They stare each other down Theres definitely chemistry
between these two But the moment is far from romantic

PETE
Youre going to have to trust me

MIRANDA
Why

PETE
Because no matter whats going
through your mind right now I
havent done anything wrong

( )

He starts

clinical

He steps back at her blowout

MIRANDA
Then you know exactly how I feel

to speak stops himself Switches tactics
Their banter escalates in speed as their terms get more

PETE
You admit youre having a hard
time differentiating whats
reality from whats hallucination
right So isnt it at least
possible that --

MIRANDA
As a doctor I agree with you
Maybe -- and this is a big maybe
-- all of this is just a deep
epilepsy that extends to the
limbic structures but Im telling
you --

PETE
How about this moment right now

MIRANDA
What about it

PETE
Is this a hallucination

MIRANDA
You tell me But I do know what I
sound like Paranoia is the
ultimate awareness right

PETE
Which is why I suggest we simply
increase your dose until --

MIRANDA
(venom)
No Goddamnit No

his face and forces herself to sit down

MIRANDA
Im sorry Is there any way we
can pretend that didnt just
happen

(MORE )

She catches the look on

( )

MIRANDA (CONTD)
(beat struggling)
I want to believe you I do So
Ill take your word for it --
youre not involved in this -- but
you take mine I didnt write
this and I didnt kill my husband

He studies her Finally nods New tactic

PETE
Alright Lets say you didnt
write this --

MIRANDA
Number one Im right-handed
Number two I would have had to
bring an X-Acto knife into the
shower to do this wouldnt I

Pete tries to reserve judgment Her argument has a
certain loopy logic to it He hesitates then pulls a
SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS from a manila envelope

PETE

I think its time you look at

these
Miranda looks at the crime scene photos Lurid
Terrible Heres part of Dougs body Heres the axe
And now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words
on it In blood a la Manson family And it says
NOT ALONE

Miranda immediately tosses it away from her Repulsed --

FLASH CUT TO

FLASHBACK - INT MIRANDA AND DOUGS HOUSE - NIGHT

Miranda furiously writes on the wall with blood Wipes
her face breathlessly leaving a thick red streak on it

INT PETES OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)

PETE
You wrote that Any idea why

MIRANDA
(panic rising)
No I didnt No I didnt
( )

Pete retrieves the photograph off the floor and holds it
up for her to study again

PETE
Youre the only person who can
figure out what this means Try
to remember Stop holding back

She nods meekly Staring at the picture Begins to
shake as all of it finally comes flooding in --

FLASH CUT TO

FLASHBACK - INT MIRANDA AND DOUGS HOUSE - NIGHT

A breathless Miranda wipes her face leaving a thick
streak of blood on it She looks down at Doug crawling
on hands and knees He moans horribly in shock She
grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him He
reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and
makes a move to grab it He has all the speed of a dying
turtle and thats pretty much what he resembles

Miranda bites her lip lifts the heavy axe with both hands

Dougs hand grabs the phone Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over
her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA

Miranda wipes her face again catches her reflection in
the mirror over the mantel and stares --

WE HEAR THAT SOUND The WETTISH GURGLING sound Miranda
stares at the MIRROR looking for the source of it For
an instant we see the teenage girls reflection there
beckoning But now shes gone and Miranda is left
studying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE
around her She looks down at her feet No fire Blood
on her clothes axe still in her hands Looks back up
at

THE MIRROR VERSION OF MIRANDA

shows a serene expression on her face Fire enveloping
her She slowly lifts her hands over her head In place
of the axe there are CHAINS attached to SHACKLES on her
wrists She is completely naked as if purified -- like
an extreme version of Anima Sola (A Biblical icon in
which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate)

Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment --

When the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and were back to
reality Miranda stares at the axe shes flung at it

INT MIRANDAS BATHROOM - LATER

Miranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink This is
a daunting task seeing as how shes covered in it She
stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor at
the marks on the door handle towels and wall

Gasping for breath almost crying she turns on the
shower at full blast and climbs into the tub She
watches the blood wash off her As if finally coming
back to her body and realizing what shes done she
slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the
tub Crying Shaking She shuts her eyes as hard as
she can to make it all go away and we --

FADE TO BLACK

BLACKNESS

Silence And now faintly at first but GROWING
PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER we hear the SOUND OF BUZZING FLIES

FADE IN
INT MIRANDAS BATHROOM - DAY

Miranda wakes up still in the tub How long has she
been there hours Days Impossible to know

But at some point she must have turned off the water
She sits up every muscle of her body aching hair caked
with blood

The first thing that hits her is the stench And its foul
the putrid smell of decaying flesh She steps gingerly out
of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of
blood mortified at what she will find

INT MIRANDA AND DOUGS LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Soon enough the press will make the Manson Family
reference but for now only Miranda is here to witness
the fruit of her labor She gasps for air

Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea She doubles over
to throw up when there is a FRANTIC RAPPING at the front
door

She freezes VOICES and YELLS trickle in The HINGES on
the door RATTLE under REPEATED POUNDING and she still
stands there as the first FIREMAN breaks in Sheriff
Ryan and his deputies right behind A concerned Pete
Graham behind them

( )

The cops take one look at the place and raise their guns
at her but we cant hear what theyre saying because

Mirandas ragged BREATHING has taken over the soundtrack
Suffice to say that at the sight of the guns something
clicks inside her and she turns on her heel and flees --

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She slips on blood nearly falls as she scrambles to the
bedroom --

INT MIRANDA AND DOUGS BEDROOM

She locks the door behind her hyperventilating in terror
Instantly there are men POUNDING on it SQUAWKING RADIOS
ORDERS BARKED at her She spots two officers through the
window in her backyard About to smash the window

A caged animal completely surrounded she covers her face
with her hands Trembling The doorknob jiggles violently
about to give And when she brings her hands down she is
staring straight into the teenage girls face And she
OPENS HER MOUTH WIDE and now we are back in --

INT MIRANDAS CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Miranda gasps for air drowning in sensory overload

MIRANDA
Oh God oh God oh God

She rocks back and forth Finally aware of what shes
done She is the killer No more doubts And now that
she knows everything is much worse

A long harrowing beat

WE PUSH IN ON her devastated face NIGHT TURNS TO DAY

INT MIRANDAS CELL - DAY

The locks are unlocked Pete appears at the door
Miranda glances up at him She looks like a different
person Completely destroyed He crouches beside her

PETE
You okay

She shakes her head slowly He sets his hand on her
shoulder She turns to him and hugs him tight holding
on for dear life Breaks down in sobs

INT PHIL PARSONS OFFICE - DAY

Parsons leafs through Mirandas file Pete stands by the
window lost in thought

PARSONS
How much does she remember
PETE
It all came flooding back last
night
PARSONS
Guilt
PETE
More like an uncontrollable
reminiscence Intense over-

cathected Shes not feeling
guilty of her actions not
exactly Sounds to me like last
night she actually re-lived them
in great detail

PARSONS
Hypermnesis following amnesia
Could a specific epileptic element
be involved

PETE
Thats exactly what she suggested
Even in her present state her
instincts remain impeccable

PARSONS
Id like to talk to her
INT WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

Pete escorts a fragile Miranda down the corridor The
two orderlies walking ominously behind them

PETE

MIRANDA
I didnt say a word
INT DR PHIL PARSONS OFFICE - DAY
Parsons on the phone gestures for them to enter

( )

PARSONS

(into phone)
Dorothy I cant discuss this
now --

(motions for

them to sit)
Im not taking it lightly no We
will talk about it at home

Miranda and Pete sit across from him Miranda trying
hard to appear composed -- acutely aware of her every
gesture and of how different her last visit to this
office was Nothing casual about it now

She stares at the picture frames on Phils desk (all
facing AWAY FROM us) the diplomas on the wall the books
by noted fathers of neurology (works by Hughlings
Jackson Kurt Goldstein Henry Head AR Luria) A
framed quote reads

If You Do Know That Here Is One Hand Well Grant You
All The Rest -- Wittgenstein

PARSONS
(into phone)
Yes dear Me too

He hangs up Takes a moment to look at Miranda Tries a
smile but to her it comes off condescending Fact is --
theres nothing to smile about

PARSONS
Im so sorry about this Miranda

She nods dazed Angles her head to look at a framed
picture on his desk Parsons looks to Pete

PARSONS
Has Pete told you about the
hearing

PETE

Teddy already filled her in

PARSONS
Teddy Howard is top notch Hes
going to do everything in his power
-- and hes quite resourceful -- to
prove youre not fit to stand trial
Miranda I know you have no family
left so were your family now and
were all going down to the wire to
protect you and help you in any way
we --

( )

PUSH IN ON Miranda who stares intently at something on
the desk Not listening to a word hes saying --

MIRANDA
Who is that

Parsons pauses here Exchanges glances with Pete

PARSONS
Excuse me

MIRANDA
The girl in the picture

WE SEE what she is talking about a framed photograph on
the desk is now FACING us Eerie It shows Parsons his
wife Dorothy and a young girl Our teenage girl

PARSONS
My daughter

Miranda looks up at this perplexed

MIRANDA
Shes the girl I saw

PARSONS
Youre obviously mistaken

MIRANDA
Im positive She was hurt
bleeding Is she all right

Pete and Parsons trade uneasy looks

PETE
Miranda youve seen that
photograph at least a dozen times
every time youve been in this
office Youre just confused --

MIRANDA
Not about this Is she all right
PARSONS
No shes not all right
(beat)
Rachel committed suicide six years

ago
This shuts Miranda right up Mind spinning
MIRANDA

How
( )

PETE
Miranda thats none of your --

PARSONS
Thats okay
(to Miranda)
Rachel was a very troubled girl
Handicapped since birth She was
born mute My wife and I tried
everything to help her fit in

but but she ran away from home
more than once wanting to end her
life

(beat)

And she finally succeeded Jumped
off Ashley Bridge She was only
seventeen years old

Ashley Bridge Mute Ghost Miranda hesitates here
She is not the type to believe in ghosts and knows full
well what even her suggestion of it will sound like

MIRANDA
Im -- Im terribly sorry Phil

Parsons doesnt want to talk about it anymore Rises

PARSONS
Peter can I speak to you

The men step outside PUSH IN ON Mirandas face as she
stares at the picture of Rachel We catch snippets of
the doctors discussion outside increasing her
paranoia --

PETE (0S)
Textbook psychotic pattern
manifestation of guilt

PARSONS (0S)
much she knows about Rachel

PETE (0S)
Im telling you she doesnt
Concocted alternate reality

PARSONS (0S)
Im trusting you crawling with
cops

A DARK SHADOW envelops Mirandas confused face as we --

INT MIRANDAS CELL - NIGHT

Mirandas pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic
light We are MOVING TOWARDS her seeing her as if from
the POV of someone approaching her We become aware of
the RAGGED BREATHING sound Miranda opens her eyes
looks this way and that then closes them again

She is nearly asleep when she hears a sound weve heard
before The strained WET SOUND Mirandas eyes SNAP
OPEN She slowly sits up back against the wall
Squinting to cover every inch of the room

And now she sees it a SHADOW crouched in the corner
Roughly the size of a person Miranda climbs off the bed
and slowly walks towards it Scared but determined

She wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it
She gets closer closer The RAGGED BREATHING GROWING
LOUDER as she reaches the shadow --

She stretches out her hand and finally touches
NOTHING She swipes her hand through the air feeling
stupid

MIRANDA
This is not going to work Im
sick of being watched and I know
this place well and it doesnt
smell this bad

She paces around the room feels the wall taps her head

MIRANDA
Im awake Im not dreaming Im
alive -- this is not some

afterlife mumbo jumbo So-called
paranormal activity can be
debunked a million different ways
So whatever you are whatever it

is Im making up here -- Im
letting you go Im setting you
free Im the wrong person And

I need to sleep Im not afraid
and I dont believe and Im fully
aware that this is all in my mind
-- fiction -- a concocted

alternate reality -- and I

acknowledge it And now Im done
with it Im going to sleep now

The moment is as brave as it is ridiculous She has
psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost And
now she climbs back in bed

( )

MIRANDA
(sleepy)
Besides if you really were the
ghost of Rachel Parsons you would
let me out of this cell

A beat And now we hear the SOUND OF THE DEADBOLT SLIDE
OPEN The door opens quietly PUSH INTO Mirandas face
Properly scared now

MIRANDA
Holy shit

If proof is what she wanted proof is what she got From
now on well refer to the teenage girl as RACHEL

INT FEMALE WARD - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Miranda takes a tentative step outside her cell feeling
the door with her fingers feeling along the wall --
still making sure she isnt dreaming this

She looks down the long empty corridor the glare of
neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily
Nobody there But when she looks down the other way she
sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall So
quick were not sure we saw it for sure

Miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction

At night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling
quality She silently strolls down the hall tilting her
head at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells

She turns to make sure Rachel isnt behind her and when
Miranda faces forward again she realizes she is standing
right across from

THE NURSES STATION

Where two nurses are watching TELEVISION Miranda tiptoes
past them ducking at the window to remain unseen

ANOTHER CORRIDOR

This one is wider Miranda is startled by the sudden
sound of LAUGHTER behind her The nurses laughing at
their late night show Momentarily distracted she
almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall
She holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a
SANITATION CLOSET

( )

She looks for something a tool Discards a pair of
brushes and finds a small screwdriver Pockets it

THE STAIRS

Miranda hurries up the stairs hugging the wall to stay
clear from the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA sweeping the area
She waits at the landing times it just right -- and
scurries to the next floor

INT WOODWARD CORRIDOR (OFFICE FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS
ACTION

Knowing her way around here Miranda keeps a steady pace
as she heads towards her old office She turns a corner
and stops in her tracks another JANITOR making his
rounds She waits until hes out of sight and rushes to
her office

She pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the

lock Starts unscrewing the screws She does this as
fast as she can but shes no professional -- so it takes
a few tries She loosens one screw then another -- and

clumsily drops the screwdriver The METAL ECHOES against
the floor

Miranda sucks her breath in waits No footsteps She
bends down retrieves it and holds onto the knob for
balance It easily turns in her hand It was open all
along She simply forgot to check

INT MIRANDAS OFFICE

Miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her
computer Shrouded in darkness Hits a switch and a
SURVEILLANCE MONITOR comes to life Now she has a view
of the corridors two guards here a nurse going for a
smoke a janitor at the coffee machine and so on

She switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she
waits for it to boot up

ON SURVEILLANCE MONITOR

The JANITOR with his coffee cup now heading back towards
Mirandas office corridor --

( )

Miranda glances at the door can see the glare of the
computer screen reflecting against the glass pane She
tries opening drawers but theyre all locked She
remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath
the couch uses it to block the light

Computer powered up she runs an online search for
RACHEL PARSONS Waits as the info appears --

MIRANDA
(to self)
Alright What happened to you

ON COMPUTER SCREEN

Various listings The archive news of her funeral
something about her search and a LOCAL NEWS ARTICLE about
teen suicide Thats the one she chooses Hits PRINT

She checks the surveillance monitor again the janitor
now mops right outside her door

ON PRINTOUT

The heading says WHAT DRIVES OUR TEENAGERS TO SUICIDE
A quick glimpse gives us ages (16 18 17) and names of
three local girls who have died Rachels name and
PHOTOGRAPH appears with two others Jenny Dixon and
Andrea White

Miranda pockets it looks back at the surveillance
monitor the janitor is walking away She watches him
disappear down the hall Slowly but surely And now the
screen is empty

But just for a second Because suddenly Rachel is there
Staring straight at her Makes us jump

INT CORRIDORSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Retracing her steps Miranda shuts her door and hits the
stairs Playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera
INT FEMALE WARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As she reaches the landing she hears VOICES coming her
way She detours down another corridor and hides from
view Waits for Consuelo and a nurse to exit down the

staircase

( )

And now she turns at ANOTHER SOUND Coming from inside
the room immediately behind her Room 237 She steps to
the small glass pane on the door and peers inside

INT ROOM 237

It takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but
now we make out TWO FIGURES in the room involved in some
sort of struggle

Miranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a
flash of metal Something sharp Not a knife but a needle
And now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm In the dim
light we can make out Chloe eyes glazed drooling

Just for a beat because now she is slapped down on the

bed like a rag doll and the man with the needle ENTERS
FRAME

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda flinches confused Glances down the corridor to
ensure she remains undiscovered Then peers back in
INT ROOM 237

Chloe on her stomach on the bed Her pale naked skin
marked with scratches and bruises The needle is stuck
in her arm which hangs off the side Her mouth is open
but it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or
sobbing Abruptly the man climbs on her pulling off his
T-shirt

As he discards it we see that it is yellow

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Disturbed Miranda turns away Except now the corridor
isnt empty There is a JANITOR at the end Coffee cup
in hand Staring at her disconcerted

JANITOR
Hey

Miranda turns and runs

INT FEMALE WARD STAIRS

Miranda bolts down the stairs THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS and
YELLS can be heard right behind her

INT FEMALE WARD THIRD FLOOR

Miranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency
exit door all the way at the end

TWO ORDERLIES emerge from the staircase and give chase
shouting for her to stop PATIENTS holler from their
cells awakened by the COMMOTION

Mirandas heart is nearly bursting through her chest as
she gets closer and closer to the emergency door Twenty
feet fifteen ten --

When a side door opens and a MAN IN A YELLOW SHIRT
appears blocking her path Miranda tries to avoid
crashing into him but carries too much momentum Veers
left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and
pins her down

The orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find
her screaming hysterical They hold her down --

MIRANDA
Its him Its him Jesus
Christ its him

The man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea
what shes talking about Ho-hum just another psychotic
woman trying to escape A nurse prepares a needle and
we --

PARSONS
Weve transferred her to a higher
security room on the fifth floor
Thats my final concession to any
type of special treatment

PETE
And the night staff

IRENE
They insist her room was properly
locked what else could they say

( )

PETE
Could there be any truth to her
claim

PARSONS

Peter we have one hundred and
forty employees Thirty-five work
maintenance They all wear yellow
shirts its their uniform Im
holding a very discreet inquiry
sure -- but I dont want a news
van parked outside day and night
It makes much more sense that she
tried to escape and got caught
doesnt it

Pete ponders this It certainly seems that way
PETE
I perused Mirandas files on Chloe
McGrath -- theyre damn

Irene and

comprehensive Maybe she was a
bit obsessed with her

Parsons share a look He wraps it up

PARSONS
The scariest gift God gave us is
our minds And a bright person
like Miranda -- shes grasping at
straws here -- who knows what her
brain is telling her now that
its snapped

INT MIRANDAS NEW CELL - DAY

A better room in fact This one has a view Heavy bars
on the windows but still Miranda paces Pete is
seated observing her deteriorating state

MIRANDA
Did you live here when Rachel
killed herself

PETE
Yes As a matter of fact I was
part of the search party that
found the body

MIRANDA
Phil must have been a wreck

( )

PETE
You can imagine Actually Phil
was in Houston undergoing triple
bypass surgery when it happened

What was that Miranda reacts to this

MIRANDA
And this is confirmed There are
hospital records and so forth

PETE
Im sure there are Can we get
back on track now

Miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket

MIRANDA
What about these other dates was
Phil here when the other girls
went missing and found dead

A disconcerted Pete looks at the article with the
pictures of Rachel and the others Andrea White and
Jenny Dixon

PETE
Where are you going with this
First Im a suspect in Dougs
death now what Phil Parsons
murdered his own daughter

MIRANDA
Rachel Parsons disappeared six
years ago A week later shes a
suicide Andrew White four years
ago same MO and Jenny Dixon
two years ago Dont you find
that unusual

He regards her Maybe Parsons is right shes
desperately grasping at straws now Skims the article

PETE
What same MO One jumped off a
bridge one hung herself and one
crashed her car Who gave you
this

MIRANDA
Not one left a suicide note In
fact how is anybody sure these
were suicides

( )

PETE
You heard Phil his daughter had
tried several times before --

MIRANDA
Thats his story I need to talk
to the reporter who wrote that
Frank something

PETE
Well you cant

MIRANDA
I beg to differ I know my
visitation rights

PETE
You cant because he died

Miranda snaps to attention here

MIRANDA
Youre telling me the one local
investigative reporter who connected
three highly-suspicious deaths just
happens to have conveniently died

PETE

Frank Albright was an eighty-year-
old retired sociology professor

(re the article)
This is a fluff piece about
teenage depression and the
breakdown of the nuclear family
You can find one in any local
paper anywhere any other week

MIRANDA
Dont be smug Pete Thats one
thing youve never been Rachel
is somehow connected to what Im
going through I dont know
how -- like you said Im not ina
frame of mind to process the
information without assistance
So Im asking you for assistance

Listen to me You are not well I
had hoped once you remembered the
murder we could deal with your
feelings about it but these

INT WOODWARD CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Peter hurries down the corridor passing by a nurse The
same one who bandaged Miranda earlier so lets give her
a proper name CLAIRE She pushes her cart into the
elevator

INT THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

Claire and her cart emerge from the elevator and she
heads down the long corridor reaches a door and unlocks
it

INT MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM

TIGHT ON a row of drug-filled shelves Claire parks her
cart and kicks off her shoes Digs a pack of smokes out
of her stashed purse when a pair of hands grab her

Claire squeaks until she sees her attacker a stoner
type named SIMON Deftly unbuttoning her uniform hands
all over her She means to resist but hes got such
boyish charm

CLAIRE
Get off me you dog --

SIMON
Hell dont go all bubbly with joy
or anything

CLAIRE
You cant be in here and you know
it Nap in your car

( )

She finally twists herself out of his grasp Points an
accusing finger but shes grinning Blushing even

CLAIRE
Now get out before we get busted

Properly reprimanded Simon picks up his folded uniform
and prepares to leave head hung low

SIMON
You slay me Claire Honest
CLAIRE
Sure I do Boy Scout
He exits She shakes her head slips her uniform back
on

Simon presses the button waits He checks inside his
folded uniform where we see several stolen vials of
sedatives The doors begin to close when --

Hold it Simon

He hides the loot behind his back busted She holds the
door open and tosses him his yellow shirt

taps an unlit cigarette As usual Irene keeps watch

From Parsons POV up above we can

BACK TO MIRANDA

Trying to get Chloes attention But Chloe just stares
at her untouched food glassy-eyed

MIRANDA
I saw what happened Im sorry

No reaction

MIRANDA
Have you told anyone Chloe
Nothing
MIRANDA
Look Chloe -- the person who did

this to you is not the devil And
if you can identify him Ill make
sure the motherfucker is arrested

Now Chloe looks at her like something finally registers

CHLOE
Doctor did you just say
motherfucker

MIRANDA
Do you know his name Maybe you
saw a nametag on his uniform
Think

Chloe simply stares Finally shakes her head

CHLOE
Man you must really hate me

MIRANDA
What I dont hate you

CHLOE
You hate me because now youre
just the same as me You must
feel so embarrassed

MIRANDA
I dont hate you And I dont
feel embarrassed

CHLOE
Thats just a pat answer you have
because youre new at this Trust

Forget it alright Forget we had
this conversation

Chloe abruptly grabs her arm Tightly

CHLOE
You know what happens next

MIRANDA
I get the distinct feeling youre
going to tell me

CHLOE

kicks in And that guilt is the
real motherfucker Youll be

afraid youll kill yourself Dr
Graham will question every harmless

B) Irene keeps watch in the garden as the women get
their daily fresh air

C) Wardens watch as each patient enters their cell at
night and the lights go off

INT MIRANDAS CELL - NIGHT

Echoing an earlier scene we are MOVING TOWARDS her --
her pale skin visible in the dim monochromatic light
Miranda flicks a look this way and that alert Sensing

something

( )

MIRANDA
Leave me alone Go away

Just like a crazy person She listens for any further
noise hears none and shuts her eyes Exhausted

MIRANDA
Ive lost my fucking mind Happy
now

Silence But now the BEDSPRINGS CREAK behind her and she
whips around and starts to scream as a big hand covers
her mouth Her eyes open wide at the sight of Simon in
his yellow shirt He shoves her against the mattress and
presses his full weight against her She lets out a
muffled scream as he uncaps a syringe with his teeth and
brings the plunger to her throat Straight into her
jugular

SIMON
(sotto)
This is gonna hurt you more than
it hurts me

She flails and kicks desperately but he pins her down
The BEDSPRINGS STRAIN violently and now hes straddling
her squeezing the plunger into her throat Her eyes
welling up

SIMON
(sotto)
Ive always wanted to do a doctor

She manages to free one hand and yanks the syringe from
her throat It flies to the floor He grins enjoying
this

SIMON
(sotto)
The more you fight me the harder
I get pussycat -- so pretty
please with sugar on top -- keep
still

Simon paws at her clothes as she struggles to defend
herself He finally slaps her free arm down Presses
his knee against it immobilizing her once more Now he
produces another syringe from his pocket Checks it
Miranda shakes her head pleading A scream stuck in her
throat But nobody can hear her

Simon brings the syringe towards her when suddenly we
hear a LOUD CLANGING at the door Shaking it off its
hinges

( )

Simon looks up confused Nobody is there The split-
second distraction is all Miranda needs to shove him off
the bed She fumbles for the discarded syringe and STABS
HIS CHEST WITH IT -- squeezes the plunger --

MIRANDA
(sotto)
Take that son of a bitch

Simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body
goes limp Miranda exhales coming back to herself A
beat

No response Miranda grabs his keys begins to undress
him

repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on and off

Miranda sweating watches the receding image of the
institute behind her Turns on the main road Free

Thank you thank you thank you

She glances back makes sure no one is following her
Catches her own reflection in the rearview mirror the
scared eyes the haunted face The new version of
herself

She flips the RADIO dial BAD NEW AGE MUZAK BAD
COUNTRY BAD DISCO More BAD NEW AGE MUZAK She finds
IGGY POPS entirely appropriate THE PASSENGER) and lets
it play

ANOTHER ANGLE

Now we are seeing her as if from the POV of someone
traveling alongside the car Peering THROUGH the
passenger window Miranda becomes aware of this slowly
glances over Sees nothing but her own reflection
Turns back forward

We NOTICE the blue cigarette lighter key chain dangling
off the dashboard Nothing but a long stretch of road
ahead

EXT MIRANDA AND DOUGS HOUSE - NIGHT

The neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night Miranda
parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house
Steels herself climbs out of the car and heads around
back

She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted plant takes a
deep breath and lets herself in through the back door

INT MIRANDA AND DOUGS HOUSE

POLICE CRIME-SCENE TAPE everywhere She turns on the
kitchen light only and scurries to her bedroom without
even looking in the direction of the living room
avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether
Eerie as hell --

INT BEDROOM - QUICK CUTS

Miranda stuffs clothes into a suitcase finds her passport
digs out some cash from a box Quick change of clothes to
get rid of the rapists uniform Fast fast fast --

INT SIMONS CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Miranda watches her house fade from view in the rearview
mirror as she drives down the block Shudders Flips
the RADIO dial with shaky hands

RADIO DJ (VO)
Weather forecasters predict
heavy winds tonight as a major
thunderstorm rolls in tomorrow
Youre listening to KLPG 1014 on
your dial This next honky-tonk
heartbreak classic is

She looks in the rearview mirror once more Only this
time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes

Rachels Inside the car
Rachels mouth opens unnaturally wide revealing a gaping
abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet

sound A threatening howl this time pure venom

Miranda covers her face jerks the car It does a 180
and slides to a halt in the middle of the street --

Facing the direction of her house again

EXT STREET

Miranda jumps out panicked Glances around Looks
inside the car no Rachel A beat to catch her breath
making up her mind Slides behind the wheel and makes a
U-turn

INT SIMONS CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling
and turns UP the RADIO GUNS the pedal Freaked

Shes driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES --

MIRANDA
No

The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop Miranda goes to turn the key
but suddenly freezes Looks at the ignition oddly and
notices the key is gone

MIRANDA
Why are you doing this to me

A dead-still beat Glancing around she is even more
startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the
middle of the street

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty
street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys

We watch her reach the keys all alone out here The
moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the
glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE Miranda
jumps out of the way narrowly avoiding being flattened
by a ROAD SWEEPER spraying water as it goes

She watches the truck disappear down the block Heart in
her throat Calms her nerves and now walks over to the
pesky keys again Smack in the middle of a puddle now

BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround
the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS
fastened around the insulators of a thick power line

From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys
And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges coming
loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some
invisible force --

Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP
and turns The bolts pop out of their sockets The LIVE
WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings
straight towards the paralyzed Miranda --

She looks down at her feet ankle-deep in the puddle
back up at the 11000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to
a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second The
wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends
SPARKS flying in every direction It looks like
lightning

A silent sudden beat That was as close as close gets

MIRANDA
(fighting tears)
What do you want from me

No sign of Rachel Miranda yells at the air glancing
over her shoulder seemingly demented

MIRANDA
What is it you want me to do

A moment Miranda stranded The stolen car in the
middle of the road And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING
abruptly Miranda whips her head in the direction of the
sound

Its the front gate to her house And now the front door
SWINGS OPEN And now the living room LIGHTS switch on

( )

Clearly Rachel wants her back in the house

MIRANDA
I cant
(softly)
Please please dont make me go
back in there

But even as shes saying this her feet are moving towards
it She pauses looks at the car in the middle of the
road Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost
electrocuted No neighbors have come out to investigate
yet but how long can that last She walks to the car

INT SIMONS CAR

Miranda climbs in not sure whether to laugh or cry here
Shes never asked a ghost for permission before

MIRANDA
Bear with me Im just parking it
out of the way so it wont look
suspicious in the middle of the
road -- okay

She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk

INT MIRANDA AND DOUGS HOUSE

Miranda stands in her living room staring at her
handiwork Frozen with dread

The blood has been cleaned up some but the mess remains
The upturned furniture covered in plastic the chalk
outline of the body the yellow crime-scene tape the
shattered mirror above the fireplace the muddied
footprints of dozens of cops coroners etc

The faded writing on the wall NOT ALONE

Miranda takes it all in not entirely sure what shes
supposed to be looking for

MIRANDA

(piecing it together)
Not alone What happened to you
happened to other girls

(beat)
I understand And Im sorry But
there is nothing I can do about it
now It has nothing to do with
me

( )

Not knowing what else to do she turns to exit when the
TELEVISION SET suddenly COMES TO LIFE making her jump
The unmistakable MUSIC from some old WB cartoon at FULL
BLAST

She stares at the TV screen Is there some sign here she
should be able to follow She crosses to turn it off and
immediately doubles over in pain --

MIRANDA
Shit

She looks at her foot A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck
right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin
Blood already seeping from the nasty cut --

INT BATHROOM

Miranda seated on the edge of the tub slowly pulls out
the piece of glass drops it in the wastebasket She
grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the
cut

And now FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears
the hollow WET SOUND weve come to associate with Rachel
Inside the room with her --

Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet Did the mirror
move We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds
perfectly still listening The SOUND now seems to have
STOPPED A silent beat

She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut grimacing
as the alcohol burns her skin It looks painful

And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes

her look up again And she sees herself in the mirror like
the night of the slaughter flames all around her Naked

arms raised Wrists shackled Anima Sola

She stares Mesmerized The sound of FLAMES GROWING
LOUDER

MIRANDA
No No No

Miranda walks slowly to the mirror Incredibly the
image reflecting back at her also grows bigger As if
the two versions of her are literally walking towards
each other FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces
mere inches apart Miranda brings her fingertips to the
mirror and touches it Immediately pulls her hand back

( )

Miranda stares at her fingertips The tips are burnt
The skin sizzles softly 200 percent scientifically
impossible And when she looks up at the mirror again --
the image is gone

It is now deathly quiet And what she finds herself
staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something
just behind her A folded newspaper discarded in the far
corner of the room

She turns to look at it now Its opened to the REALTY
LISTINGS page Doug must have left it there She picks
it up and looks closer Focusing on a picture of a bank-
repossessed property

The address is in Willows Creek

Her brain wires start clicking This must be what Rachel
wanted her to see She stares at it

PUSH IN ON the picture as we --
MATCH CUT TO

EXT WILLOWS CREEK PROPERTY - DAWN

A FOR SALE sign still flapping in the wind The first
few rays of light break through the dawn sky

Mirandas (Simons) car approaches up the road until it
FILLS the FRAME and parks Miranda steps out

She studies the house before walking up the drive We
watch her peek through windows and walk around back
looking for something What exactly we dont know
(Neither does she)

She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes
her stare now on the barn The one place he hasnt
looked

INT BARN

Dark empty The WIND outside causes the ALUMINUM SIDING
to FLAP NOISILY Its slightly unnerving but hey its
just the wind Miranda covers the distance of the large
room perplexed There is something about this place
Something she cant quite put her finger on Beckoning
her

With a last fruitless look she heads towards the front
door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops
her She moves to it

( )

And here where the walls should meet there is a narrow
gap leading to a passage maybe five inches wide A
padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both
walls holding them together Miranda inspects the heavy
padlock the source of the glint She tugs on the wall
and opens it to the limits of the chain but thats only
a few inches more Miranda peers into the darkness
beyond but cant see a thing

Hesitating only a moment she turns sideways and slides
herself into the claustrophobic slot

She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face
brushes against something hanging in the air She stops
startled Its a pull-string hanging from a naked light
bulb

She tugs on it And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow
to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of
her She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY
CREAK She peers into the pitch-black basement below
Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs
down

INT SECRET BASEMENT

Miranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness
Whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb
upstairs does not reach here She feels around the wall
for a switch Nothing

MIRANDA
(to self)
Its not shrink-appropriate to be
afraid of the dark right

Abruptly theres a sharp CLICK as she lights Simons key-
chain lighter and the wavery light illuminates the vast
space Rats scurry for cover It takes a second to orient
ourselves Something metallic catches the lighters
reflection way in back Miranda walks towards it

MIRANDA
Hello

She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on
the floor She stops Kneels down and in the dim half-
light we make out a backpack She unzips it and rifles
through it (T-shirts underwear Walkman) until she finds
a wallet Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next
to the ID the picture belongs to a teenager named
TRACY MARIE SEAVER

( )

MIRANDA
Is there anybody here Hello

The lighter in her hand is getting hot so she lets it
click off When it comes back on we see she has wrapped
a ragged T-shirt around it for insulation

Miranda steps deeper into the room Up ahead she can
make out the metallic thing that reflected light before
It is a hook in the ceiling And suspended from it are
several heavy chains

Like a meat rack

And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and
sees the body of the teenage girl hanging upside down
tied around the hands and ankles

Medical training kicking in Miranda quickly lowers the
girl to the ground causing the angry rats to skitter
away

MIRANDA
Go away Fuck off

(We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so
that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an
almost strobe-light effect )

She checks for vital signs pulse heartbeat -- Mirandas
adrenaline at full tilt --

MIRANDA
Cmon cmon cmon --
She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the
girls pupils Inspects them Slaps her repeatedly
clinically

The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the

immediate surroundings household tools strewn about
wire cutters pliers -- a pool of dried blood
MIRANDA

Wake up Tracy wake up --

Nothing She unties the wires around the girls ankles
The skin swollen grotesquely around them She shakes the
girl Slowly coming to the realization that its too
late

EXT BARN —- LATER

Miranda comes crashing out of the barn doubles over and
throws up The bright light outside blinding her
momentarily Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to
register --

THE PATROL CAR

parked in front of the house A POLICE OFFICER
cautiously peering inside her stolen car He looks up
and notices her

Miranda hesitates Nowhere to run The officer waves
His name is TURLINGTON

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Howdy there

He says this while already strolling over Mirandas
mind races a mile a minute --

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Everything okay

MIRANDA
Y-yes

OFFICER TURLINGTON
That your vehicle maam

She stares at the young friendly cop His left hand
resting on his belt Right next to his gun But it
seems as if he has no idea who she is At least not yet

MIRANDA
Yes -- I -- I just pulled over I
was -- looking for a bathroom

Morning sickness you know

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Congratulations But Im afraid
this is private property -- you
cant just waltz on in You
understand that

She nods nerves shot to hell Starts walking
MIRANDA
Ill be on my merry way now My
husband will never forgive me if I
get a ticket for trespassing

( )

The cop nods at that seeming to have a fair grasp of

marital dynamics He flashes a smile but suddenly
whips out his gun and trains it on her --

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Holy shit
(clicks the safety
off)
Lady stay right where you are

Miranda shuts her eyes busted Freezes

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Hands up where I can see them

Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Nice and slow start talking to
me And make it good Tell me
just exactly who that is

stops

A confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction hes
looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door Dragging
herself in agony clearly in a severe state of shock

Battered yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive

But just barely

EXT JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY

A car pulls up to the chaotic ER area Phil Parsons and

Pete step out rush inside

INT HOSPITAL ER - MENS ROOM - DAY

Sheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal But even here he

cant find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his
case --

SHERIFF RYAN
Mr Howard -- let me simply list
the events your client was
involved in last night First she
drugs a janitor steals his car
and escapes a mental
institution --

TEDDY HOWARD
Hold on there isnt even any
substantial evidence --

( )

Sheriff Ryan zips up his pants flushes and runs the sink
to wash his hands --

SHERIFF RYAN

Mr Howard -- there isnt evidence
because the overdosed janitor
hasnt woken up thats why -- and

when your client was questioned on
the matter she admitted to
injecting a full syringe of --

TEDDY HOWARD
(handing him a
paper towel)
You had no right to question my
client without my presence --

SHERIFF RYAN
Mr Howard this is not a courtroom
Your client was read her rights and
she still insisted --

TEDDY HOWARD
-- Let me ask you this Sheriff
what exactly was a janitor doing
with several vials of sedatives
inside my clients cell And is
it not possible he had taken some
drugs himself before my client --

Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to
the waiting room Teddy following closely --

INT ER WAITING ROOM

Paramedics and nurses doing their thing The young
officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of
coffee

SHERIFF RYAN
Im not a drug expert Im simply
stating the frigging facts

Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee notices
Parsons and Pete approaching Relief crosses his face

SHERIFF RYAN
Phil thank God -- this guys
driving me nuts

PARSONS
What happened

( )

SHERIFF RYAN
An ‘incident -- for lack of a
better frigging word -- involving
Miss Grey and a teenage girl whos
been tortured and is in critical
condition and chances are slim
shell even utter another word

PETE
Whos the girl

SHERIFF RYAN
A runaway from Portland Tracy
Marie Seaver Reported missing a
couple weeks ago We found Miss
Grey in some barn off Willows
Creek with the girl all messed up
Im just now waiting for the
surgeon to give me an update

(to Teddy )

Notice Counselor how Im not
even mentioning her trespassing or
lying to a police officer

Teddy waves him off in frustration Goes to talk to
Turlington

SHERIFF RYAN
Christ the womans got the entire
hospital busy --

Sheriff Ryan notices Teddy talking to Turlington --

SHERIFF RYAN
Why are you harassing my deputies

TEDDY HOWARD
Im only asking him where he got
the coffee --

SHERIFF RYAN
Hes not at liberty to answer
that Youve had enough goddamn
coffee already

The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons They walk over to

the water

cooler where they can talk more privately

PETE
We need to get Miranda back to the
institute She needs psychiatric
care not a prison cell

( )

Parsons nods lost in thought Sheriff Ryan returns

SHERIFF RYAN
Phil how well does your wife know
the suspect

PARSONS
Why do you ask

SHERIFF RYAN
Because shes at the station right
now demanding to speak with her

Parsons frowns at this concerned Pete studies him

INT COUNTY STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY

Bare room A desk and two chairs Glass window panes to
insure no privacy DOROTHY PARSONS (50s) waits seated
The door opens and a DEPUTY escorts Miranda in She sits
across from Dorothy looking as lost as can be A long
beat

DOROTHY
How are you

Miranda doesnt answer Her mind elsewhere Namely back
at the barn and how it connects to Rachel

DOROTHY
I needed to see you but Im not
sure where to begin I dont know
you well I certainly have nothing
but fond feelings for you Phil
always keeps me posted on his
colleagues and his work and -- in
any case I have always thought of
you as a very bright very
perceptive doctor Even though I
dont know you well

She pauses here Miranda looks up now Her face hollow
and exhausted Bags under her eyes A person who has
seen too much Wondering where the hell this is going

DOROTHY
My point is my point being --
when Rachel died I had um I
suffered through these spells
these recurring dreams

(MORE )

( )

She drifts off

resume

Miranda cant help but smile to herself at that

Dorothy Parsons starts to cry

DOROTHY (CONTD)
And eventually once I came to
terms with her death they went
away Losing a child is the
hardest most inconceivable event
a mother can --

DOROTHY
The past few days I have been
having the same dream A
nightmare

MIRANDA
That word Nightmare Welcome to
my life

DOROTHY
This nightmare involves Rachel but
it also involves you In the

nightmare Rachel holds a box in
her left hand A small box And
she repeats a series of numbers
Now Rachel never spoke from the
time she was born -- she had a
condition -- I often asked God why
he punished this child in such a
way -- she couldnt speak but she
was extremely bright She wasnt
autistic as the doctors claimed --

Takes a beat to collect herself and

A moment passes like

this It seems she wont recover enough to continue her

tale

MIRANDA
Mrs Parsons you need a
therapist Normally I would
encourage you to schedule a
session with me but as you can
see --

Dorothy shakes her head determined to finish
out a folded piece of paper

DOROTHY
Every night the same box in her
hand and the same numbers I

wrote them down

She pulls

( )

She slides the paper over Miranda watches her
carefully then looks at the piece of paper The numbers
are

1-0-2-2-0-1
A long beat

DOROTHY
Its a message Its a code for
something I dont know what
But she wants you to have it

Miranda studies it Studies this woman who quite
frankly seems to have completely lost her mind Then she
looks back at the numbers and is slowly hit with a
realization

MIRANDA
October 22nd 2001 Its my
wedding date

She stares at Dorothy stunned Brain click-click-
clicking Her wildest fears confirmed Doug is behind
this somehow

MIRANDA

That code belongs to a safety
deposit box my husband kept ina
bank up in Newcastle thats where
his parents live

(beat)
Dorothy I need you to drive up
there and open it

Dorothy stares at her scared And finally nods

EXT WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY

Pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as
TWO POLICE CRUISERS pull up Miranda is brought out of
one of the cruisers by two OFFICERS

PETE
We can take those off now

Sheriff Ryan leans out of the other cruiser
SHERIFF RYAN
Dont push it Doctor Shes
cuffed until your people secure
her in a cell

( )

Pete sighs gestures for the officers to bring her in
Irene and two heavy-duty orderlies will also be part of
the escort Miranda locks eyes with Pete as she
approaches

PETE
Are you alright
MIRANDA
(quietly)
I was wrong It wasnt Phil
Parsons It was Doug
PETE
Can we talk about this later
(to Sheriff)

Thanks Sheriff

SHERIFF RYAN
Tomorrow morning first thing my
deputies are here

PETE
I know I know Well see you
then

SHERIFF RYAN
And my offer still stands if you
need added security

PETE
Thank you She wont go anywhere
I guarantee it

The Sheriff waves whatever Knocks twice on the hood
and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive

MIRANDA
Thats why Rachel picked me It
was Doug Im so stupid

Pete regards her now has no idea what shes going on
about this time Tries to remain professional

PETE
Inside okay
INT CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER
Lunch time for the female wing An excited Shelley
rushes over to a table where Chloe and Jenna are

whispers something to them They glance at the door

( )

A moment later Miranda walks in with her police escort
Taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door
An uneasy Pete leads Irene and the wardens at the rear

Miranda glances at the women staring at her like a
specimen Like somehow shes even more dangerous than
them Top dog as it were of the crazies

And then halfway across the room one of the women
stands up Chloe She claps her hands together
Slowly Miranda watches her confused And slowly
Shelly Jenna and others rise as well All of them
joining Chloe in clapping

PETE
What is this

IRENE
Shes a hero Little Red Riding
Hood put the big bad wolf ina
coma

Pete nods Just what he needed The OFFICERS trade looks
OFFICER 1
Theyre not gonna start something
are they
Irene shakes her head amused
IRENE
You aint scared of a bunch of
women now are you Officer
The entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their
solidarity for Miranda Chloe locks eyes with her

mouths the words thank you

And Miranda is hauled out the side door

INT MIRANDAS NEW CELL

White Surveillance cameras in every corner Two
separate doors with elaborate locks High security all
around The officers undo Mirandas cuffs and excuse
themselves

Pete gestures for Irene and the Orderlies to leave as
well

ORDERLY 1
Well be right outside Doctor

( )

Once the doors are locked and theyre alone the
conversation jumps straight into frustrated high gear

PETE
I pulled a lot of strings to get
you transferred back The best
case scenario youre looking at
right now is five years here
Five Under my --

MIRANDA
(interrupting)
Peter I didnt believe in ghosts
before this And neither do you

Pete is at the end of his rope Cant hide his sadness
when he looks at her Still he tries to get her back on
track

PETE
But you know that the brain is
fully capable of tricking you into
seeing all sorts of things The
simplest chemical deficiencies
can --

MIRANDA
Chemical deficiencies cant get
inside of you and make you do
terrible things you dont remember
doing

PETE
Im a very open-minded person but
as a doctor --

MIRANDA
No youre not Youre a close-
minded academic just like me
You told me once that I was the
most logical person you knew
remember Well everything thats
happened has an explanation but it
has nothing to do with psychiatry
or science Rachel Parsons was
abducted and she was murdered six
years ago -- tossed off the Ashley
Bridge by my husband My
harmless righteous ‘community
leader husband -- thats how
pathetically blind Ive been

(MORE )

( )

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Andrea White and Jenny Dixon were
also abducted and murdered -- now
this was before I met Doug but I
bet you anything that they both
went to his school Then he
obviously stopped for a while
fear guilt distractions --
namely me -- delayed him from
reverting to his sickness Thats
why I didnt notice anything I
believe he really tried to lead a
normal life for me Then along
comes Tracy Seaver and he cant
resist Locks her up and tortures
her in some abandoned property --

She shows him the crumpled newspaper listing

MIRANDA
Heres Dougs interest in real
estate Pete

Pete stares at the realty listing for Willows Creek

MIRANDA
Rachel Parsons is a pissed-off
ghost with an agenda furious at
her parents for giving up on
her -- shes been trying to
communicate with them for years
but theyre too goddamn logical to
pay attention -- and she picked
me she sought me out that night
and sent me home to fix her
problem Made sure I killed Doug
because he was going to do the
same thing to Tracy Seaver as he
did to her And she will get rid
of anyone who stands in her way

Pete takes all of this in Dumbfounded

PETE
Is that a threat

MIRANDA
To whom

PETE
To me

( )

MIRANDA
To you Im telling you she
nearly electrocuted me when I
tried to leave town and she led me
to that barn and if I dont do
what she wants -- shes going to
kill me

Pete can see that shes petrified He starts to speak
but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his
lips The gesture is tender almost romantic A
reminder of their very real connection

MIRANDA
I need you to at least consider
the possibility that Im not
insane
(beat pleading)
Not as a doctor As the only
person I trust in this world

EXT NEWCASTLE COMMUNITY BANK PARKING LOT - DAY
A tense Phil and Dorothy Parsons in their parked car

DOROTHY
Im not doing it for Miranda Im
doing this for Rachel

PARSONS
Youre making a complete fool of
yourself Do you realize what you
sound like

She sighs climbs out of the car leaving him there
Takes three steps Stops Turns back around and lets
him have it

DOROTHY
What do I sound like Phil Like
one of your patients Well its
probably because thats exactly
how you treat me And Ive had
enough of this deafening silence
between us this exemplary
mourning in front of the
community tiptoeing around our
lives with you pretending Rachel
never existed

BANK CUSTOMERS walk around the argument pretending not
to hear Phil is mortified But Dorothy doesnt care

( )

DOROTHY
Im losing my mind Our daughter
is gone and I miss her and Im
angry

She turns and storms off Phil takes it all in for the
first time A moment later he climbs out of the car

INT BANK VAULT - DAY

A solemn GUARD places the safety deposit box on the table
in the middle of the room Steps back through the gate
and waits Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a
moment

Finally Phil punches in the code written out by his wife
and opens it He sorts through some paperwork that means
nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope He
opens it and spills the contents on the table

It is a stack of POLAROIDS

Dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens She
grabs onto the table shakily -- and is forced to sit
down A horrified sob rises from deep inside her comes
out like the howl of a dying animal Her husband pales
all blood draining from his face

EXT WOODWARD INSTITUTE - EVENING

The sky darkens fast The storm moving in

INT WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NURSES STATION
THUNDER RUMBLES outside making a tray of meds rattle
PAN UP to see Consuelo the round black woman we might
remember Chloe beating up earlier She shakes her head

night
INT MIRANDAS NEW CELL
Miranda looks up at the sound of the BOLT BEING DRAWN and
the handle unfastened Through the door comes Consuelo
carrying a tray Sets it down by the bed

She is on her way out when she pauses stares at Miranda

( )

CONSUELO
How are we doing today

That term again we Doctor-speak Miranda doesnt
have the energy for it

MIRANDA
Just fine thank you

CONSUELO
The spirit is not fine Shes
very unhappy

What was that Normally Miranda would look at this woman
as if she were crazy but things have changed

MIRANDA
How -- how do you know

CONSUELO
(shuts her eyes)
But shes only a girl Do you
know her name

MIRANDA
Yes Rachel

CONSUELO
Have you talked to her

MIRANDA
Yes I -- you could say that

Consuelo holds Mirandas hands firmly reading her

CONSUELO
Shes very very angry And shes
not finished with you yet

MIRANDA
Im sure thats meant to sound
comforting but --

CONSUELO
She wants to show you something
MIRANDA
That may be so but I want her to
go away
CONSUELO

Then you need to protect yourself

( )

MIRANDA
And how exactly would I do that

CONSUELO
Mira first Im gonna bring you
some cascarilla its a powder
you get it anyplace it comes from

eggs -- you pour it all over
you --
(indicates)
Like this --
MIRANDA
Look --

(reading nametag)
Consuelo I appreciate what youre
trying to do but I honestly dont
think this ghost will go away if I
pour some egg powder on myself --

Consuelo holds up a finger hushing Miranda Shes
receiving something here Shudders

CONSUELO
She made you do things Bad
things didnt she

MIRANDA
Yes

CONSUELO
And you carried this out for her
She used you as a vessel

Consuelos grip tightens on Miranda as we --

FLASH CUT TO

FLASHBACK - EXT ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

Were back at the bridge Rachel pries open Mirandas
mouth Miranda panics

MIRANDA
What are you doing Im trying to
help you --

Rachel opens her mouth wide like a snake And as Miranda
screams blood starts leaking out of Rachels wounds

And now we see it Rachels lips touch Mirandas and
BREATHE HER SPIRIT INTO Miranda with a WHOOSH --

INT MIRANDAS NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)

Consuelo lets go of Mirandas hand Like recoiling from
fire Speaks in the simplest of ways The truth

CONSUELO
You were possessed by her

MIRANDA
Yes

CONSUELO

Ay probrecita Youre both in
terrible danger Shes scared too
but she cant step back into the
light until she finishes what she
started here And now youre the
only person who can help her find
the way back

MIRANDA
I dont know how to do that -- Im
not qualified for it You do it

Consuelo crosses herself A sign of respect for the
situation But it has a chilling effect on Miranda

CONSUELO
Despair is the only unforgivable
sin Youll be in my prayers
Miranda

Prayers What good is that going to do Consuelo exits

tranquilized

Sheriff Ryan inspects the photographs

Postcards from hell scared teenage girls in forced
poses -- gagged tortured -- Andrea White Jenny Dixon
Tracy Seaver

And young

Rachel Parsons

PARSONS
This proves that her story is
true my daughter appeared to her
in some form and guided her
through all this putting things
right

SHERIFF RYAN
Come on Phil you of all
people --

PARSONS
I of all people hold logic reason
and facts above everything else
And seek the truth through proof
and proof only
(re pictures)
And what do you call that

SHERIFF RYAN
Has it occurred to you that maybe
she knew what her husband was
doing to those girls

PARSONS
No Frankly it hasnt

SHERIFF RYAN
Maybe she couldnt stand the guilt
and cooked up this far-fetched
tale to tug at everybodys
heartstrings The fact remains
she hacked her husband to pieces

PARSONS

The fact remains my daughter was
murdered and Miranda stopped the
killer A killer who was loose
under your incompetent nose for
over six years We dont know how
many future victims were spared
but we do know she saved that girl
in the barns life And thats
more than you or I can say --

SHERIFF RYAN
Calm down For the record that
girl is on a ventilator The
doctors dont think shell make it
through tonight

SHERIFF RYAN (CONTD)

Now you want to stand up

ina

courtroom and tell a judge that a

ghost is behind all this
your prerogative -- but I

thats
have to

abide by the law And the law
says Miranda Grey faces criminal

chargers So heres what

were

going to do Im going to leave a
cruiser outside to make sure you

dont go anywhere tonight

of my deputies will go guard Ms
Grey until tomorrow morning

Phil

Parsons doesnt respond His eyes far away

SHERIFF RYAN

There will be no breakouts no
aiding and abetting no taking the

law into your own hands

Itll

take an Act of God for Miranda
Grey not to show up in that
courtroom tomorrow Are we clear

And now the Sheriff can see that Parsons is crying
Quietly miserably And its a disparaging sight
Sheriff Ryan exits Two deputies follow RADIOS

SQUAWKING

Parsons remains still for a moment

then digs a

photograph out of a drawer A picture of Rachel in

happier times

PARSONS

Im sorry I will never forgive
myself for what happened to you

Not as long as I live
(breaking down)
I miss you so much

He sits there staring at his dead daughter Grieving

WE PULL BACK to see he is not alone

her

MIRANDA

INT SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

Officer Turlington looks inside Mirandas cell Empty
And as he is about to speak into his walkie he spots her
Seated by the elevator Holding a biting block in
Shelleys mouth as her seizing subsides

OFFICER
(into radio)
Sheriff I have Miss Grey right

He flashes his light at her Miranda looks back blankly

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Sorry we thought you might have
made a run for it

MIRANDA
Page Irene ASAP This patient
needs her meds

Turlington nods Miranda looks down at a grateful
Shelley whose head is cradled in her lap Brushes the
matted hair off her face Carefully removes the biting
block making sure Shelley is alright

Were doing the final count Now
they cant find the Sheriff
Miranda scans the near-dark room looking for someone
Watches Turlington step aside to take a call on his
radio Parsons regards her with newfound respect

PARSONS
Are you alright Miranda

MIRANDA
Fine Phil Thanks for asking

Suddenly all the policemen in the room begin to exit --

PETE
Whats going on Officer

OFFICER TURLINGTON
One of your patients is holding
the Sheriff at gunpoint Shes in
the cafeteria
Pete glances at Miranda She knows exactly who it is

MIRANDA
Chloe

Turlington is about to exit when Parsons stops him
PARSONS
I think Doctor Grey should be the
one to talk to her

INT CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

The DOOR CRASHES open and Chloe shoves the Sheriff
inside She has a gun pressed hard against his ear

( )

SHERIFF RYAN
Young lady I dont know how you
think you can get out of here
but --

CHLOE
Youre very polite for a piggy
Now take off your uniform

Sheriff Ryan hesitates Chloe presses the gun against
him

CHLOE
Do it quick I wont make fun of
you

The sound of the UPSTAIRS DOOR BEING THROWN OPEN makes
her glance up She trains her flashlight at the second
level stepping behind the Sheriff to use him as cover

CHLOE
Nobody better fucking move up
there or Ill blow this piggys
head off

Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM searches the section Catches the
reflection of a police shield hiding behind a table

CHLOE
That means you fucko Up on your
feet or Ill start by shooting his
ear off

A beat Officer Turlington rises Slow and deliberate

CHLOE
(to Sheriff sotto)
Tell junior the grownups are
talking now and hes not allowed
in here Do it

SHERIFF RYAN
Turlington its alright I
can -- Im just going to --

CHLOE
The grownups are talking Dont
paraphrase me

SHERIFF RYAN
The grownups are -- are talking

( )

A voice startles Chloe from behind at floor level

MIRANDA
Chloe Can I talk to you

Chloe flicks the flashlight to see Miranda by the door

CHLOE
Dreadful timing Im real busy

MIRANDA
You have to let him go Im sorry

Chloe flinches at that Like all this multitasking is
affecting her She digs the gun deeper into the Sheriffs
neck making him cower to his knees execution style --

CHLOE
Look -- lets not confuse things
I like you But this is my only
chance
(to Sheriff)

Now take off that goddamn uniform
before I get really pissed

The Sheriff glances at Miranda Miranda nods The
Sheriff begins unbuttoning his shirt --

MIRANDA
What are you going to do Put on
his uniform and walk out of here
Think about it Chloe They know
you have him The place is
crawling with cops

CHLOE
What are my options To grow old
in this place Its clear they will
never let me go Never Ever

MIRANDA
Thats not true You have less
than a year left here

CHLOE
Thats a lie Ill never stop
being sick theyll just find
something new thats wrong with
me No wonder you doctors cant
help anyone -- all you have are
deficit columns and stupid tests
designed to point out what part of
the puzzle you think were missing

( )

She starts sobbing Letting everything go --

MIRANDA
Youre right doctors never
concentrate on the things patients
are actually capable of But I
know you Chloe youve been
through things that most people
dont survive And you have a
wonderful future in front of you
if you choose it Its up to you

This gets through to Chloe Her grip loosens on the gun

MIRANDA
No more guilt no more hatred no
more unbearable sadness You have
no use for any of that anymore
Your life begins this very second

CHLOE
Im so tired So goddamn tired --

Miranda walks over and embraces her Chloe hands her the
gun

And thats when the power returns

Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace Sheriff Ryan
on his knees In the sudden shocking glare of returning
light color abruptly re-enters the world and every
RADIO PHONE FAN and MACHINE that were left on HUM TO
LIFE

Miranda finds herself staring at Sheriff Ryan bathed in
the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the
cruisers outside The image a replica of the Andrea
White and Jenny Dixon visions

Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning
of a chest TATTOO Miranda slowly trains the gun on the
Sheriff finally struck with the realization

MIRANDA
It was you wasnt it

SHERIFF RYAN
What are you talking about

She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo a 1950s pinup-
style WOMAN SURROUNDED BY FLAMES ARMS RAISED SHACKLED
Anima Sola Mirandas recurring vision from the night of
the slaughter

( )

MIRANDA
Not alone Thats what Rachel
has been trying to tell me all
along Doug was not alone You
were with him This whole time
its been you You covered up
their deaths to look like
suicides

The Sheriff throws his jacket on starts walking --

SHERIFF RYAN
Youve lost your mind

MIRANDA
Dont fucking move

The CLICK of a SAFETY being released makes him pause
He turns to look at her A tense beat

PETE (0S)
Miranda dont do it

She glances at Petes pleading face and the room around
her cops everywhere All guns trained on her

Sheriff Ryan speaks low so only she can hear the
following

SHERIFF RYAN
And just exactly who would believe
you No proof no living witness
Everybody knows youre crazy

Mirandas finger itches on the trigger as they face off
Her hand starts to shake Sheriff Ryan turns and strides
off Getting away Further Further

But as much as she wants to she cant bring herself to
do it Finally brings the gun down The armed policemen
rush over and disarm her shove her to the floor and cuff
her

SHERIFF RYAN
I want that woman in custody She
has a judge to face in the morning
EXT WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT (HEAVY RAIN)
Turlington escorts a cuffed Miranda to a waiting cruiser
He jumps behind the wheel and starts to pull out when

Pete suddenly taps on Mirandas window startling her --

( )

PETE
Ill call your lawyer and --

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Sir not now --

PETE
Ill meet you at the station

She shakes her head Mouths something Pete cant make out

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Sir please --

PETE
What

Turlington hits the gas Miranda presses her face
against the window so only Pete can see her say the
following

MIRANDA
The girl in the hospital

Pete locks eyes with her nods -- as the cruiser leaves

INT JACKSON HOSPITAL - RECOVERING ROOM - NIGHT

Tracy Seaver lies unconscious hooked up to a series of
machines PULL BACK to find Pete with a young DOCTOR

DOCTOR
Her condition remains the same
Basically that ventilator is
keeping her alive We have no
reason to think shell ever wake
up Im sorry

Pete nods disconcerted Stares at the girl

PETE
You mind if I stay here tonight
DOCTOR
Hey its a big place The more
the merrier If I can just ask

you to wait outside

INT WAITING AREA
The Doctor gestures for Pete to make himself comfortable

( )

HOSPITAL LOUDSPEAKER (VO)
Dr Brooks to ER Dr Brooks --

DOCTOR
Thats me Excuse me

The Doctor rushes off

INT RECOVERY ROOM 2

Like Tracy Seaver Simon Reynolds is hooked up to a bunch
of machines and cables Suddenly his EYES SHOOT OPEN and
the CARDIAC ALARM SQUEALS --

Two NURSES rush in The young Doctor right behind

NURSE 1
V-tach

The EKG whipsaws The Doctor feels for a pulse then slaps
on the defibrillator pads places the paddles on the chest --

DOCTOR
Clear

He begins chest compressions on Simons heart He spasms
violently once twice -- And then it stops The Doctor
and Nurses stare at the monitor Flatline

Unseen by them Rachel steps out of the room

EXT COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

WE SEE Turlington and two other COPS climb in a patrol

car and drive off WE MOVE INSIDE the empty station
INT SHERIFF RYANS OFFICE

Sheriff Ryan takes a healthy chug from a fifth of Scotch
slips it back in a drawer Stares at his hands Steady as
a rock Takes a deep breath Knows what he must do next
A religious man despite everything he brings his thumb

to his forehead and crosses himself

INT COUNTY STATION - HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER

Mirandas eyes snap open at the SOUND OF DEADBOLTS
SLIDING UNLOCKED Hopeful Could this be Rachel

( )

A looming
shut it
so begins

figure appears at the door Doesn’t bother to
Stares at her silently for a long while And
a claustrophobic cat and mouse game

SHERIFF RYAN
How did you know

MIRANDA
You tell me

SHERIFF RYAN
This isnt one of your word
association games Doctor Did
Douglas tell you that night

MIRANDA
Why wait this long if he had

SHERIFF RYAN
Maybe its your amnesia Maybe
you blocked it out

MIRANDA
Maybe But it seems to me that
its vital you know for sure

He studies her Takes a step towards her Miranda
responds by stepping back A slow motion semicircle if

you will

She eyes the open door Tempted

SHERIFF RYAN
You think me and Doug are
monsters That this was alla
carefully laid out plan with those
girls But it wasnt that at all
You do things sometimes and youre
not sure why you did them Then
you realize you can live with them
and so can everyone else Life
goes on

MIRANDA
If youre looking for forgiveness
you came to the wrong place

Shes stalling trying to keep him talking and he knows

it

SHERIFF RYAN
One thing about fear is it makes
people say the dumbest things

( )

MIRANDA
Be that as it may youre afraid
too -- because you know killing me

wont solve your problems

SHERIFF RYAN
My only problem is you

MIRANDA
What about Parsons And Peter
They know And that girl in the
hospital will never forget your
face You miscalculated now you
pay

Patience tested he suddenly WHACKS her across the face

She makes

SHERIFF RYAN
I hate a bad bluffer

a big effort to hide how much that stung

MIRANDA
I sure hope that felt good because
you cant afford too many more
signs of struggle Can you

SHERIFF RYAN
Go ahead hit me back Its what
you want

MIRANDA
No thats what you want me to do

SHERIFF RYAN
Back to profiling huh Your
thought process is completely
transparent

And now Miranda briefly takes the reins of the
conversation Analyst and patient in session Echoing
her opening scene with Chloe

MIRANDA
So were even You left that door
open so Id try and run its what
you get off on isnt it

SHERIFF RYAN
I guess well find out

( )

MIRANDA
And yet you have to make me look
like a suicide With what your
belt
(off his shrug)
How would I get access to a belt

SHERIFF RYAN
Trust me prisoners hang themselves
with just about anything

MIRANDA
I dont think thats going to
satisfy you You wont be able to
do this clean You have too much
guilt inside

SMACK Another slap across the face Mirandas knees
buckle But she remains standing Her lip trembles

MIRANDA
Youre losing grasp of the
situation It was different with
those girls I bet all they did
was cry and scream

SHERIFF RYAN
Dont worry youll scream
(after a beat)
Take off your shirt

This throws her off She shoots a quick glance at the
door

MIRANDA
Arent I a little old for you

SHERIFF RYAN
Take it off

She hesitates He draws his gun tired Removes the
safety

MIRANDA
Thats for show You know you
cant shoot me

SHERIFF RYAN
But I can smash your teeth out and
make it look like you bashed your
head against the wall Now shut
up take off your goddamn shirt
and pull off your bra

( )

Miranda is petrified now Running out of ways to hide
it

SHERIFF RYAN
Today Doctor

In a sudden move Miranda shoves the chair at him and
bolts out the door The Sheriff doesnt move to stop
her

INT HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda dashes down the hallway trying to escape Takes
quick inventory of the space two more holding cells
like her own a row of filing cabinets and a storage
area with barred windows She makes a turn up ahead and
reaches another gate down the corridor A sliding gate
that closes off the cell area from the main station

She tries the gate Locked naturally She shakes and
bangs on it desperate

MIRANDA
TURLINGTON SOMEBODY HELP ME

No response And no way to disguise the sheer panic in
her voice She fell for his trap Theyre all alone
here

INT MIRANDAS CELL - SAME TIME

Ryan smiles at that Re-holsters his weapon and walks
towards her taking his time Relishing the hunt

SHERIFF RYAN
Doug mentioned you were painfully
modest But enough about you
lets discuss Rachel

INT HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Now Miranda searches for a place to hide His FOOTSTEPS
GETTING CLOSER --

SHERIFF RYAN (0S)
She was no crippled saint Wasnt
the first time she turned up at
Dougs house all messed up

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sheriff Ryan peeks down the corridor where we last saw
Miranda The gate still locked Shes not there He
traces her steps clearly enjoying this

SHERIFF RYAN
Sure she was a minor but she
wasnt going to let that get in
her way

INT STORAGE AREA - SAME TIME

Miranda is cramped underneath an upturned desk The SHOT
is FRAMED so we can see the doorway She prays silently

MIRANDA
(sotto)
Rachel where are you when I need
you

Clearly not here Sheriff Ryans voice getting closer

SHERIFF RYAN (0S)
Those other girls -- make no
mistake -- they knew what they
were getting into

He appears at the doorway now peeks inside the room
Sensing her in there Miranda holds her breath

SHERIFF RYAN
Im not saying they knew they were
going to die but truth is Doug and
I didnt know it was going to end that
way It was just the natural extension
of that moment So yeah we fucked
them and we killed them And we knew
it was wrong Sure we did

He reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a
CLANGING SOUND Miranda wasnt underneath that one She
scrambles to the door behind him as he turns --

INT HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to
slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly
SMASHES OPEN against her knocking her backwards onto the

floor --

He looms over her She reaches around for anything to
defend herself Nothing there Game over --

( )

SHERIFF RYAN
It wasnt some satanic pact
society didnt make us do it But
I believe given the proper
circumstances a person is capable

of anything -- certainly in my
line of work you see it day in
day out

(beat)

Tell you what keep the shirt
The bra will do

Miranda stares helpless The Sheriff gestures for her
to begin Like he has all the time in the world
Miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra
under her shirt Petrified --

SHERIFF RYAN
Chin up Doctor You wanted to
get to the bottom of this and you
did You followed it all the way
through This is how it ends

His demeanor and voice are eerily calm as if ina
trance He takes the bra from her hand and hangs it
around her neck as if helping somebody with their tie
She takes a step back and finds herself pinned against
the wall --

SHERIFF RYAN
Doug settled down once you two got
married New start and all that
Wanted nothing to do with this
runaway Id found Tracy Seaver --

He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat choking
her She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole
body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking
uncontrollably --

SHERIFF RYAN
Or so he claimed Because the
truth Doc -- is people never
change The son of a bitch
couldnt resist I asked him to
dump the body and instead he went
found some barn to work her out of
his system some more Go fucking
figure

And now we PAN DOWN TO see Mirandas left hand ever so
slowly reach for his holster

( )

SHERIFF RYAN
You cant count on anyone even
friends youve had your whole
life

Theyre so close together their noses nearly touch He

gazes into her eyes watching life drain out of her He
applies one final burst of pressure stretching her skin
to the point of no return --

SHERIFF RYAN
The only soul you can ever count
on is yourself --

BLAM A GUNSHOT rings out and half his ear explodes in a
gush of blood He stumbles back still on his feet
dazed

He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him
Struggling to catch her breath A faint smile forms on
his lips somehow appreciative of this turn of events

SHERIFF RYAN
Why Doctor That was unexpected

He steps forward almost playfully She slowly shakes
her head Wraps her fingers tightly around the
trigger --

SHERIFF RYAN
You sure about this

He stares at her Blood flowing from the side of his
head Hes now standing directly in front of Mirandas
open cell weighing his options at triple speed --

SHERIFF RYAN
You need me alive for your story
to stick Be logical now You
know you cant kill me

He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills
a BULLET through his forehead Sheriff Ryan splays
backwards and lands with a crash
MIRANDA
Logic is overrated

INT HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

The door to Tracys room is closed WE FIND Pete where
we left him by the soda machine fighting to stay awake

( )

MOVING TOWARD him we COME TO REST ON the back of his
neck So TIGHT we can actually see the hairs on the back
of his neck And as he feels the SWOOSH of a cold
whisper they stand up on their ends
Pete turns to Tracys room to notice that the door is now
open Strange He stands up and walks to the door
INT RECOVERY ROOM 1

Pete looks oddly around the room

PETE
Anybody in here --

As he turns we REVEAL Rachel slipping out of the room
Unseen by him of course Pete starts to exit when Tracy
opens her eyes Groggily waking as if from a dream
TRACY SEAVER

Hello --
EXT COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Turlington comes out of his cruiser carrying a bag of
take-out food Chatting with his colleagues
INT HALLWAY TO SHERIFF RYANS OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Turlington raps on the Sheriffs door and opens it

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Sheriff Ryan

No sight of the man Thats odd Maybe hes in the
bathroom Turlington heads in that direction

INT MENS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Turlington peeks in checks the stalls

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Sheriff

Nobody He notices the back window is open because
raindrops are blown in by the wind He looks out to the
parking lot for a moment before shutting it

INT POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR

The FRONT DESK OFFICER is trying to hold back a grim Pete
Parsons and Teddy Howard from heading to the back area

FRONT DESK OFFICER
Im sorry but nobody is allowed
to visit at this hour --

PETE
Is the Sheriff here or isnt he

OFFICER TURLINGTON
(reaching the scene)
Help you gentlemen

PETE
Were here to see Miranda Grey

OFFICER TURLINGTON
You know full well youre not
allowed to see --

Teddy Howard slaps an official-looking document on him

TEDDY HOWARD
Thats straight from Judge
Wilkinson Take us to her cell

FRONT DESK OFFICER
Better get the Sheriff out here

Turlington looks over the paperwork confused

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Sheriff Ryan isnt here His car
is gone too

PARSONS

Officer unlock the goddamn door

to Mirandas cell or Ill break it

down myself
Turlington is not used to being spoken to this way
certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric
institutes He leads the men down the corridor and
unlocks the cell The men wait as all three locks are
dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open

The men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks

INT HOLDING CELL
Sheriff Ryan splayed Very dead

( )

OFFICER TURLINGTON
Jesus H Christ

Teddy Howard has to look away Pete places his hand on
Parsons shoulder Parsons simply glares at the dead
man eyes filled with hatred

No sign of Miranda anywhere Vanished Like Houdini

DISSOLVE TO

EXT WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY

CAMERA SOARS THROUGH the tall gates PAST the guard PAST
the sprinklers watering the impressive gardens A
TAXICAB pulls up

SUPERIMPOSE SIX MONTHS LATER

A healthier much happier-looking Chloe shakes Petes
hand at the front steps Small suitcase by her side

CHLOE
Thank you for everything Dr
Graham Ill never forget all
youve done for me

PETE
Its been my pleasure Miss
McGrath Good luck out there

Chloe smiles Awkward Her first day out in the real
world

CHLOE
Well I guess this is it I hope
not to see you again unless its
for coffee or something

PETE
Hey you never know Its a small
world unless you have to clean it

Chloe picks up her bag climbs down the steps to her cab
Stops midway turns

CHLOE
You dont have to tell me if you
dont want to but -- have you
ever heard anything from --

Pete shakes his head Chloe nods climbs inside the cab
Pete waves as it drives off Then he pulls out a postcard
from his pocket It has a New York City postmark
INSERT - POSTCARD

MIRANDA (VO)

Dear Pete Hope this finds you on
both feet preferably having been
promoted to director after Phils
retirement Not that you had much
competition but a big hug to you
anyway I was as surprised as
anyone to read about Sheriff
Ryans suicide and the startling
discovery that it was he who
murdered my late husband I wish
I could personally thank certain
people for their convincing
testimonies in the case

NEWSPAPER HEADLINES
fly AT us under her VO

to keep an open mind at the
horrors they tell me

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

BOOM DOWN TO a young woman kneeling down to set flowers
on a grave and we recognize her as Tracy Seaver
Shockingly cleaned up and properly attired -- shes even
cute

MIRANDA (VO)
Which reminds me Consuelo the
Cuban witch is a keeper dont
fire her She knows things about

PULL BACK to see the gave is Rachels and it is
positively overflowing with flowers Shes become
something of a cause celeb in these parts Tracy walks
back to the retired couple holding hands Phil and
Dorothy Parsons

MIRANDA (VO)

Well gotta run now I have some
country songs to write and lots of
social invites to decline

STILL PULLING BACK THROUGH the lush cemetery PAST
several trees until we find Rachel watching the serene
scene She turns TO CAMERA now and we PUSH INTO her
eyes finally at peace until it FILLS the SCREEN and in
it we see

EXT BLEEKER STREET (NYC) - DAY

Miranda walking among the throng of pedestrians She
looks confident relaxed down to earth No longer the
tightly wound professional at the beginning of our story

MIRANDA (VO)

PS And in case youre wondering
what the chances are of me buying
you a beer and maybe finishing
something we almost started the
answer is its just not going to
happen Especially not at
McSorleys next Friday night Say
around nine So you probably
shouldnt bother showing up All
my love MG

She turns at the light and gets lost in the crowd

FADE OUT

THE END
