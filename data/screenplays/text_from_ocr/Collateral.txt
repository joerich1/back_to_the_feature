VINCENT He walks towards usan arriving passenger Suit
Shirt No tie Sunglasses and expensive briefcase say
confident executive traveler The suits custom-made but not
domestic His hair and shades are current but it would be
difficult to describe his identifying specificsgrey suit

white shirt medium height And thats the idea

CLOSE BEHIND VINCENT

OVER his left shoulder walking through milling travelers
towards the distant wall of metal and glass sunlight streaming
at him

ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN

- suit blonde crew cut - walks to camera Same sunlight but

it hits him from the side His trajectory is from the left

His eyeline is slightly right Just now he looks down at a

ticket in his hand

OVER VINCENTS LEFT SHOULDER

right now something catches Vincents eye And the two men bump
into each other

TWO-SHOT

VINCENT

Vincent puts down his briefcase The man has a similar
briefcase

Images wipe across the screen kinetic and abstract floating
and dreamlike in SLO-MO

Shades of yellow Ribbons of silver Shimmers of chrome

Headlights sweeping past flaring to white Brake lights
flashing halating red Reflections of overhead fluorescence
flowing like liquid along windshield glass

SOUNDS are dreamlike and abstract reverberated and discordant
bouncing off concrete walls car doors OPENING and CLOSING
Brakes A BABBLE of multi-lingual crosstalk
Racing Forms A Farsi newspaper African hands ona
Blackberry Maxs hands do The New York Times crossword A
West African speaks French into a cell phone Metallica in a
headset Hip-hop Norteno

Mechanics hands change tires replace air cleaners close a
hood

2 INT TAXI DISPATCH - LA - DAY 2

windshield

corrosion from the fumes We find Max cleaning Chinese take-out

THREE SMALL POPS A different gun 22 caliber Ruger with a
thick silent barrel Three small holes And Daniels head
falls forward Vincent catches it arranges Daniels arms so
that Daniels head rests on them as if hes taking a nap And
Vincent did it gently almost regretfully A red mist of blood
swirls in the air

Max is stunned beyond words and powder-burned at such close
range

Silence now No ones noticed The waitress was in the

list with all the names of all the bad
children and Pedro would come every
night to check them out And the

people the little kids that were
misbehaving that were not saying

their prayers Pedro would leave a

little wooden donkey on their windows
And he would come back and if the
children were still misbehaving he

would take them away and nobody would
ever see them again Now if am

the floor waiting for the doors to close the train to pull

out hoping Vincent hasnt followed

VINCENT

has to decide has to second-guess Max A beat The train sits
there for seconds It seems like hours like fucking forever
Vincent riveted to the spot Max Annie praying Vincent
doesnt appear

The doors start to close sliding irrevocably shut

VINCENT

Then he knows With no hesitation he leaps off the platform
onto the rails as the train starts to pull out

C106A INT FOURTH SUBWAY CAR - MAX ANNIE C106A

106D INT FOURTH CAR - VINCENT - NIGHT 106D

VINCENT

is coming

VARIOUS ANGLES

and the SEQUENCE BUILDS Vincent working toward the front
Max and Annie desperately looking for cover City racing by

Train racing by city A few RAGGED PASSENGERS trying to huddle
out of harms way with nowhere to go As the TRAIN THUNDERS AND
SHRIEKS over the track junctures

THE FIRST CAR

Max and Annie rush in slide the door shut This is as far as
they can go They drop into a crouch at the door breathing
hard terrified Max with his back against the wall arm stiffly
keeping the door handle wedged tight his head just below the
doors window A harsh ragged whisper

ANNIE
Wheres the next station

A frozen moment Eyes locked Knowing theyre probably going
to die together even though they hardly know each other

THE TRAIN GOES BLACK LIGHTS DYING AS THEY SHRIEK OVER ANOTHER
JUNCTUREthen the LIGHTS RETURN stuttering

Max rises slightly up peers over the lip of the window Here
comes fucking Vincent down the aisle of the second car He sees
Max He shouts barely audible from here

VINCENT

YOU CANT WIN MAX 1 DO THIS FORA

LIVING

and he keeps coming 45 at his side a sheet of blood down
his face from the missing part of his ear

the visage of Vincent the 45 in his hands scares the shit
out of the early-morning passengers

and Max clutches the HK takes a deep shaky breath his
eyes on Annies not even sure in that moment what hes going to
do probably die and he lunges up Vincent not ten feet away

AND THE TRAIN GOES DARK

93003 MM revs (cherry) 110A
106D 106D

A BLIZZARD OF MUZZLE FLASHES both men FIRING THROUGH THE
WINDOWS at each other GLASS SHATTERING between the cars and
getting sucked away by the wind Max screaming face lit only by
the GUNFIRE clumsy in how he holds Vincents HK firing one-
handed not aiming not looking where hes shootingVincents
Para-Ordnance BOOMING OUT MASSIVE ERUPTIONS OF FLAME

93003 MM revs (cherry) 111
106D 106D

and then abrupt silence as the LIGHTS RETURN Max looking
down his expression nearly childlike with terror He stares at
the HK in his shaking hand sees the slide is locked back -
guns empty He rises up His look says go ahead kill

me through the shattered window

Vincents standing in the other car right where we left him
Watching Max A little smile on his face

107 INT VINCENTS CAR - NIGHT 107

Vincent ejects the empty magazine Before it even hits the
floor or at his feetVincents hand loading a full mag the
weapon pointed at Max like it was when he reloaded and shot
Peter Yip the first time

Odd though His fingers arent working that well His
brilliant sleight-of-hand seems gone He fumbles the reload in
fact

The magazine of stacked 45s drops landing at his feet among
the expended casings A few fresh droplets of blood patter
quietly

Vincent considers picking up the mag but it suddenly seems like
way too much trouble He blinks at the 45 in his hand as if
confused then turns and starts unsteadily back toward the back
of the car

The 45 slips from his fingers clattering to the floor

Max watches Vincent walk away

Vincent only makes it halfway He has to sit He grabs an
aluminum pole eases himself onto the seat trying to catch his
breath

Max slides his door open steps across the bridge between cars
Slides the second door open Enters

Vincent turns his head slightly watching Max draw cautiously
nearer Max stares down seeing the blood spreading across the

floor beneath Vincent Turning into quite a pool

Vincent tries to speak cant quite manage Max sits across
from him Annie appears in bg watching them

VINCENT MAX
sit there riding the train Softly

MAX
Were almost at the next station

Vincent smiles faintly He leans his head toward Max as if
conferring a secret In a halting whisper

VINCENT

Guy Gets on a subway Dies
(off Maxs look)

Think anybodyll notice
MAX

looks into Vincents eyes It means Im that guy and will
anybody notice me when Im gone

VINCENT

leans back gazing straight ahead now Rocking gently with the
motion of the train

and with much effort and to Maxs amazement Vincent emits a
soft rasping wheeze but its a faint laugh all the same
Max has no idea whats so funny to a dying man Vincent looks

Max follows his gaze There right across the car among all
the ADVERTISEMENTS near the ceiling is

AN AD

The whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine A dream place
Limitless horizon

107A INT VINCENTS CAR - MAX - DAWN 107A

Vincents no longer laughing In fact Vincents no longer
doing anything Ever

Annie comes to Max and sits She shivers Max takes off his
zippered hooded sweatshirt and puts it around Annie Its a
small gesture But its a protective and confident act She
takes his hand Dawn lightens the sky ahead They ride the
train together side by side neither saying a word For now

The train pulls in to a station
WIDE ANGLE OF SUBWAY CAR
and Max pulls Annie to her feet The doors open They
silently get off The first sideways streams of yellow light

shaft into the station

The doors close again The train pulls out

82403 MM revs 113
107A 107A

WE HOLD ON Vincent for a while Riding the train by himself
into the dawn his head back as if sleeping alone in the car
as the sun rises
Another dead guy on the subwayriding into a new day
And Max in his Polo shirt and dirty pants an arm around Annie
wearing his stained sweatshirt rises to us up the

escalatorfreeways arteries of traffic behind them

FADE OUT
