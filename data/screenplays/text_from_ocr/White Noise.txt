WHITE NOISE

From the Novel by Don Delillo

Screenplay by Noah Baumbach
A blank movie screen

A man Murray Suskind 50s appears in front
shouldered with a professorial goatee

MURRAY
OK roll film

He’s stooped

A whirring sound CLOSE on film going through a projector

A soft white light illuminates shadowing him against the

screen

He exits frame

A montage of car crashes from movies and TV plays on the
screen The images are intercut with students watching
fascinated taking notes and Murray delivering his lecture

MURRAY
Don’t think of a car crash ina
movie as a violent act
No these collisions are part of a
long tradition of American
optimism A reaffirmation of
traditional values and beliefs A
celebration

Front end collisions Rear end smashes Cars sailing off
bridges Trucks with buses Motorcycles with cars Cars

with helicopters

MURRAY
Think of these crashes like you do
Thanksgiving and the Fourth of
July On these days we don’t
mourn the dead or rejoice in
miracles No these are days of
secular optimism of self-
celebration

Trucks with trucks Cars skidding into crashes

Cars

smashing into poles Cars breaking through supermarket

windows

MURRAY
Each car crash is meant to be
better than the last There is a
constant upgrading of tools and
skills a meeting of challenges
(MORE )
MURRAY (CONTD)

A director of an American film
says “I need this flatbed truck to
do a midair double somersault that
produces an orange ball of fire
with a thirty-six-foot diameter”
The movie breaks away from
complicated human passions to show
us something elemental something
fiery and loud and head-on Its a
wish-fulfillment a yearning for
naiveté We want to be artless
again We want to reverse the flow
of experience of worldliness and
its responsibilities We will
improve prosper perfect
ourselves Watch any car crash in
any American movie It is a high-
spirited moment like old-fashioned
stunt flying walking on wings The
people who stage these crashes are
able to capture a lightheartedness
a carefree enjoyment that car
crashes in foreign movies can never
approach You might say “But what
about all that blood and glass the
screeching rubber the crushed
bodies the severed limbs What
kind of optimism is this”

(pause)
Look past the violence I say

The images connect like dance moves--gestures big and small

MURRAY
There is a wonderful brimming
spirit of innocence and fun

At the moment of impact of the final grand collision we CUT

WHITE NOISE

EXT COLLEGE-ON-THE HILL DAY

From above A long line of shiny station wagons ease their
way around an I-beam sculpture and toward the dormitories
Blue green burgundy brown The roofs loaded down with
carefully secured suitcases

Part I WAVES AND RADIATION

Jack (40s) watches from his office window He wears an

academic robe a sleeveless tunic puckered at the shoulders
Tinted sunglasses on his face
JACK (VO)
Let’s enjoy these aimless days
while we can

We see kids and parents unloading cars Students greeting
each other with comic cries and gestures of sodden collapse
The parents stand sun-dazed near their vehicles The first
day of school

JACK (VO)
You should have been there

BABETTE (VO)
Where

The distant sound of traffic on an expressway
INT THE GLADNEYS HOME
Babette late 30’s descends the stairs as Jack enters

JACK
It’s the day of the station wagons

BABETTE
Did I miss it again You’re
supposed to remind me

JACK
It was a brilliant event They
stretched all the way past the
music library and onto the
interstate

BABETTE
You know I need reminding Jack

A quick kiss hello

JACK
They’1ll be back next year
BABETTE JACK
I hope so I realized I’ve witnessed
this event now for sixteen
years

They pass through the foyer Babette retrieving Jack’s
discarded jacket and hanging it in the closet

JACK
It was 1968 I started the Hitler
Studies program
BABETTE
I don’t care about the station
wagons I wanted to see the people
What are they like this year

JACK
The women wear plaid skirts and
cable knit sweaters

BABETTE
I knew it And the men are in
hacking jackets What is a hacking
jacket

JACK
They’ve grown comfortable with
their money They genuinely
believe they’re entitled to it

JACK BABETTE
They glow a little I have trouble imagining
death at that income level

JACK
Maybe there’s no death as we know
it just documents changing hands

They enter the kitchen Denise 16 Steffie 10 are getting
food from the refrigerator making sandwiches mid-
conversation

STEFFIE
How do astronauts float
DENISE HEINRICH
They’re lighter than air There is no air They can’t

be lighter than something
that isn’t there

Heinrich 14 is seated at the breakfast table and stares at
a chessboard mid-game while everyone else sets about making
lunch Utensils drop and are tossed in the sink A period
of chaos and noise as everyone moves and speaks at once

BABETTE
Not that we don’t have a station
wagon
(to the kids)
I thought space was cold

JACK
It’s small and metallic gray it
has a whole rusted door
STEFFIE
Space
JACK DENISE
Our station wagon It’s called the sun’s
corolla We saw it the other
night on the weather network
STEFFIE

I thought Corolla was a car

HEINRICH
Everything’s a car

BABETTE
(suddenly)
Where’s Wilder
(calling out)
Wilder

Jack scoops the four-year-old boy up off the floor and places
him on the counter among the open cartons crumpled tinfoil
shiny bags of potato chips Babette smiles

BABETTE
(to Wilder)
Are you hungry

The child nods Heinrich plots his next move hovering a
knight in mid-air above the board

JACK
You still playing the fellow in
prison

HEINRICH
(nods )
I think I’ve got him cornered

JACK
Who did he kill again

HEINRICH
He was under pressure

Babette regards her plate a large sandwich and chips

BABETTE
This isn’t the lunch I planned for
myself I was thinking yogurt and
wheat germ

DENISE
Where have we heard that before
STEFFIE JACK
Probably right here How many people did he shoot
HEINRICH
Five
JACK

Five people

HEINRICH
Not counting the state trooper
which was later

A smoke alarm beeps somewhere in the house

DENISE
(to her mom)
You keep buying stuff that you
never eat

STEFFIE
Because Babette thinks if she keeps
buying it she’ll have to eat it
just to get rid of it

DENISE
But then we end up throwing it out

Babette opens the newspaper in front of her and starts to
read everyone’s horoscope using a story-telling voice

JACK
We love her habits If anyone here
has to show discipline in matters
of diet it’s me

DENISE
What’s that beeping

Amidst the activity Babette cracks open an amber pill bottle
and slips a small white pill into her mouth She chases it

down with orange juice Denise watches this intently

BABETTE STEFFIE
It’s the smoke alarm Is there a fire

DENISE HEINRICH
There’s either a fire or the Most fires in buildings start
battery is dead because of faulty wiring

That’s a phrase you can’t
hang around for long without
hearing Faulty wiring
JACK BABETTE
I’1l replace it (eating a strip of
bacon)
OK Jack Virgo You’ve

been swimming against the
tide for the better part of a
year now but--

Jack grabs a banana and leaves the room

HEINRICH
He tries not to listen Although I
think he secretly wants to too

STEFFIE
It’s like love slash hate

Babette gets up and surreptitiously drops something into the
garbage can beneath the sink on her way out of the room

BABETTE (0S)
I’m going to take a shower and then
we’ll go to the mall

DENISE
(to the room)
Didn’t she already shower today

Steffie and Heinrich continue talking about Heinrich’s chess
partner Denise goes to the garbage and reaches inside
Denise makes a face as she feels around the muck She pulls
out an amber pill bottle The label reads Dylar

DENISE
(to herself)
Dylar

BABETTE (VO)
What do you want to do

INT JACK AND BABETTE’S BEDROOM NIGHT
Jack in striped pajamas embraces Babette in a big
sweatshirt and underwear They roll onto the bed Their

conversation has a deeply intimate tone

JACK
Whatever you want to do

BABETTE
I want whatever’s best for you
JACK
What’s best for me is to please
you

BABETTE

But you please me by letting me
please you

They reposition themselves trying to kick the sheets off
their ankles The radiator gurgles and clanks

RADIO (0S)
This creature has developed a
complicated stomach in keeping with
its leafy diet

JACK
Is it wrong for the man to be
considerate to his partner

BABETTE
I’m your partner when we’re playing
tennis which we ought to start
doing again by the way Otherwise
I’m your wife Do you want me to
read to you

JACK
First-rate

Jack leaps up and opens a drawer at the bottom of a dresser
There’s a stash of erotic books He leafs through them

BABETTE
Please don’t choose anything that
has men inside women or men
entering women “I entered her”
“He entered me” We’re not lobbies
or elevators

JACK
Got it
BABETTE
“IT wanted him inside me” As if he

could crawl completely in sign the
register sleep eat and so forth

TV (0S)
until Florida surgeons attached
an artificial flipper
BABETTE
I don’t care what these people do
as long as they don’t enter or get
entered

Jack selects a book with raised lettering and a muscular man
and busty woman on the cover He holds it up to her She
nods

They fall into each other
LATER

Dark We barely make out the faces of Jack and Babette lying
in bed intertwined The book discarded onto the floor

BABETTE
Life is good Jack

JACK
What brings this on

BABETTE
I just feel it ought to be said

She turns over He embraces her from the back

BABETTE
(almost romantic)
I want to die first

JACK
(withdrawing)
You sound almost eager

BABETTE
Life would feel unbearably sad and
lonely without you Especially if
the children were grown up and
living elsewhere Right now we’re
safe As long as the children are
here They need us

JACK
It’s great having these kids
around but once they get big and
scatter I want to go first

BABETTE
No Jack

JACK
Your death would leave an abyss in
my life I would be left talking
to chairs and pillows

BABETTE
Your death would be more than an
abyss--
JACK BABETTE
What’s more than an abyss It would be ayawning gulf
JACK

Your death would be aprofound
deptha void

She turns back to him their faces almost touching in the

dark

BABETTE
(angry now)
Don’t be an ass Your death would
definitely leave a bigger hole in
my life than mine would leave in
yours

JACK
Youll be fine You’1l travel and
have a new and exciting life I’11
just sit in that chair in the suit
that I wore to your funeral
forever

BABETTE
You’re wrong
(turns back around)
And you don’t really want to die
first You don’t want to be alone
but you don’t want to die more than
you don’t want to be alone

Jack says nothing

JACK
I hope we both live forever
Doddering toothless liver-
spotted hallucinating
(pause)
Who decides these things

A din of Nazi propaganda crowds speeches etc

JACK (VO)
Who is out there Who are you

CUT TO A projected montage of Nazi propaganda films scenes
shot at party congresses outtakes from mystical epics
featuring parades of gymnasts and mountaineers Edited
together impressionistically and scored to the sounds of
chants songs arias speeches cries cheers accusations
shrieks

INT SEMINAR ROOM DAY

Jack sits next the projector in the booth in the back of the
room The movie images reflected on the glass

CUT TO Lights are up The movie has ended Jack walks down
the center aisle

JACK
When people are helpless and scared
they’re drawn to magical figures
mythic figures epic men who
intimidate and darkly loom

A male student confidently raises his hand

STUDENT
Could you talk about the
Stauffenberg July 20 plot to kill
Hitler

Jack stands in a shallow light at the front of the two-
hundred seat theater Kids of means in poplin shorts
polos and rugby stripes shuffle papers whisper Jack hits a
button on a slide projector Hitler’s face superimposes over
his body

JACK
All plots move deathward This is
the nature of plots Political
plots terrorist plots lovers’
plots narrative plots--

INT CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH BASEMENT DAY

Babette teaches posture to a group of mostly older adults
She stands turns assumes various poses while referencing
yoga kendo trance-walking in relation to posture

The older folks nod and listen reverently Some trying to
mirror her gestures

JACK (VO)
--plots that are part of children’s
games

INT DEN GLADNEYS HOUSE

The family watches a sit-com on TV while eating Chinese food
Steffie moves her lips attempting to match the words as
they’re spoken Denise reads The Physicians Desk Reference

JACK (VO)
We edge nearer death every time we
plot

Steffie grabs Denise’s book Denise protests

JACK (V0)
It is like a contract that all must
sign the plotters as well as the
targets of the plot

INT BOARDING HOUSE ROOM

A mild-looking man tucks his head into his trunk narrows his
eyes and suddenly makes grimacing humanoid faces like he’s
having a seizure This is Howard Dunlop

DUNLOP
Study my tongue

He gapes he croaks

DUNLOP
Tomorrow is Tuesday
Morgen ist Dienstag
(irritated)
Tomorrow is Wednesday but tomorrow
is Tuesday

JACK
Tomorrow is Tuesday
(realizing)
Well

DUNLOP
I am eating potato salad
Ich esse Kartoffelsalat

On Jack now as he repeats the facial gestures and noises as
best he can It’s a tortured over-articulation of what he
just heard They sit in a dark crowded room An ironing
board unfolded at the window An exposed radiator an army-
blanketed cot

JACK (V0)
Id appreciate it if you didn’t
mention these lessons to anyone

CUT TO After the lesson Jack counts out cash Dunlop
shrugs

JACK

You probably don’t know but I’m
maybe the most prominent figure in
Hitler studies in North America
Im JAK Gladney I teach
Advanced Nazism over at the College-
On-The-Hill

(silence)
So aS you can understand it’s a
great source of embarrassment for
me that I don’t speak German
Maybe it explains the dark glasses
butbest not to analyze it

Dunlop nods Jack hands Dunlop the cash

JACK
I’ve made several attempts in the
past to learn it but with very
little success As you can
probably see something happens
between the back of my tongue and
the roof of my mouth

Dunlop nods and opens the door to a narrow second floor
hallway An old man grasping a toothbrush and a tattered
towel shuffles toward the bathroom

JACK
After all I require my students to
take a minimum of one year of
German

The old man knocks on the bathroom door Someone shouts
panicked “Occupied” The old man turns and shuffles back to
his room his slippers scuffing against the wooden floor

JACK
The urgency isthe Hitler
conference is coming here to the
College On-The-Hill in the spring
And scholars from all over Germany
will be in attendance Do you
think you could get me up to speed
on the basics of the language by
then

Dunlops shrugs

DUNLOP
I also teach sailing

JACK

This is exciting

MURRAY (0S)
We have them in New York

Murray Suskind (recognizable to us from the opening lecture
on car crash movies) appears a basket under one arm

MURRAY
The oven aroma of bread combined
with the sight of a bloodstained
man pounding strips of living veal
is very exciting

Murray’s basket is full of non-brand items in plain white
packaging and simple labeling CANNED PEACHES BACON
(without a plastic window) IRREGULAR PEANUTS (Murray has
a habit of sniffing various products as he gathers them )

JACK
Murray Suskind This is Babette
my wife

Murray removes a glove and they shake Wilder reaches for
the cereal Jack lifts him out of the cart so he can touch
the lower boxes

JACK
Murray came to College On The Hill
this year from New York His
specialty is American icons

MURRAY

(nodding)
You have a very impressive husband
Mrs Gladney Nobody in any
university in this country can so
much as utter a word about Hitler
without a nod in JAK’s
direction Literally or
metaphorically

BABETTE MURRAY
He’s Jack in real life Hitler is now Gladney’s
Hitler I marvel at what
youve done with the man I
want to do the same with
Elvis

Denise tries on a green visor the tag hanging Steffie nods
in approval

MURRAY

Babette appears to pause

BABETTE
There’s Denise of course

She trails off looking at other items on the shelf as a
distraction

BABETTE

HEINRICH
They’re always saying boil your

MURRAY
(observing the kids)
Family is the cradle of the world’s
misinformation

JACK
There must be something in family
life that generates factual error

MURRAY
It’s because facts threaten our
happiness and security

BABETTE
(returning to drop items
in the cart)
It’s the overcloseness the noise
and the heat of being

Babette goes to look for gum Murray struggles to open a
filmy plastic produce bag his fingers failing to find the
opening

MURRAY
Your wife’s hair is a living
wonder

JACK

Yes it is

MURRAY
She has important hair

JACK
I think I know what you mean

MURRAY

Tell Denise you’re sorry

STEFFIE

JACK
She’s a great girl and she wants to

little bossy don’t you think

JACK
And aside from telling her you’re
sorry be sure to give her back her
book

STEFFIE
It’s a medical journal and she
reads it all the time It’s weird

JACK
At least she reads something

STEFFIE
It’s lists of drugs and medicines
And do you want to know why she
reads it

JACK
Why

STEFFIE
Because she’s trying to find out
the side effects of the stuff that
Babette uses

JACK
What does Baba use
STEFFIE
Don’t ask me ask Denise
JACK
How do you know she uses anything
STEFFIE
Ask Denise

hips

BABETTE (VO)
I know I forget things but I
didn’t know it was so obvious

Jack greets her at the bottom of the steps Thirty girls in
bright shorts run past the overlapping rhythms of their
footfalls pattering

They embrace He slips his hand in the waistband of her gray
cotton pants

JACK
We all forget

BABETTE
Sometimes I call Steffie Denise
I forget where I parked the car I
don’t care what the girls say it
can’t be the gum I chew that’s too
farfetched

JACK
Maybe it’s something else

BABETTE
What do you mean

JACK
Maybe you’re taking something
besides chewing gum

BABETTE
Where did you get that idea

JACK
I got it secondhand from Steffie

BABETTE
Where did Steffie get it from

JACK
Denise

She hesitates

BABETTE
What does Denise through Steffie
say I’m taking

JACK
I wanted to ask you before I asked
her We always tell each other
everything

BABETTE
To the best of my knowledge Jack
I’m not taking anything that could
account for my memory lapses
These are the days that I want to
remember

JACK
Everybody forgets things there’s a
lot going on

BABETTE
My life is eitheror Either I
chew regular gum or I chew
sugarless gum Either I chew gum
or I smoke Either I smoke or I
gain weight Either I gain weight
or I run up the stadium steps

JACK
Sounds like a boring life
BABETTE

eyes)
I hope it lasts forever

INT GLADNEY’S DEN EVE

No

HEINRICH
Baba likes a cup when she comes
back from class

The sound of a car door closing Denise reacts
STEFFIE

Her class is demanding Coffee

HEINRICH

That’s why it’s dangerous
STEFFIE

Why is it dangerous
HEINRICH

Anything that relaxes you is

dangerous

Denise enters and sprawls across the foot of the bed her
head resting on her folded arms She faces away from Jack

DENISE
She can’t remember anything with
those pills she takes

TV (0S)
And other trends that could
dramatically impact your portfolio

JACK
We don’t know for sure she’s taking
something

DENISE
I saw the empty bottle buried in
the trash under the kitchen sink

JACK
How do you know it was hers

DENISE
I saw her throw it out It had the
name of the medication Dylar

JACK
(sitting up)
Dylar

DENISE
“One every three days” Which
sounds like it’s dangerous or habit-
forming or whatever

JACK
What does your book say about
Dylar

DENISE

That’s just it It’s not in there
I spent hours There are four
indexes

JACK
It must be recently marketed Or
go by different names Do you want
me to double check the book

DENISE
I looked If we could get an
actual pill maybe you could get it

analyzed
JACK
I don’t want to make too much of
this
DENISE JACK
We could call her doctor Everybody takes some kind of
medication everybody forgets
things occasionally
DENISE

Not like my mother

JACK
I forget things all the time

DENISE
What do you take
JACK DENISE
Blood pressure pills stress --eye drops Aspirin I
pills allergy pills-- looked in your medicine

cabinet I thought there
might be a new bottle

JACK
No Dylar

Denise turns and faces her step-father

DENISE
No

JACK
Well maybe she’s done taking it

DENISE
Why don’t you want to believe
something might be wrong

JACK
(hesitates)
We have to allow each other to have
our secrets Don’t you think

DENISE
She hides books on the occult in
the attic I found them
(Jack starts to say
something)
Also I don’t think she went to her
posture class tonight

JACK
Why do you say that

DENISE
I don’t know but she went right
instead of left at the Stop sign

JACK
Maybe she’s taking the scenic
route

INT BEDROOM LATER NIGHT

The radiator sizzles and groans water leaking from the
temperature knob

Jack opens his eyes He’s lying in bed The room is dark
He turns to look at the pillow next to him No one is there
A white light from the street flickers on and falls through
the window revealing the torso of a shadowed figure sitting
in a chair in the corner of the room next to the radiator

JACK
Baba

Close on the figure’s hand Long bony fingers A winding
scar on the top (We’ve seen this hand before) The fingers
pull idly on a loose string on the arm of the chair

Jack lies there afraid A light moves across the ceiling as
we hear the steady rattle of a car outside going over a
loose manhole

The hand slowly recedes pulling the thread and then the
figure stands up and walks into the bathroom Jack waits in
terror We hear the sound of peeing Then a toilet flush
The figure reappears The sound of the bowl refilling The
figure walks over to the bed and casually sits at the edge

Jack watches motionless Then the figure climbs under the
sheets and into the bed where Babette usually lies Jack’s
breaths can be heard in the silence

The sheet rises up suddenly a face outlined in the folds
It looms over Jack His face locked in terror It wraps
itself around Jack enveloping him in the material like a
body on a slab in the morgue

CUT TO Jack opens his eyes He’s tangled in sheets
sweating paralyzed His eyes slowly adjust to the dark

The digital clock on his bedside glows green 351 He falls
back down on the pillow

Someone is wrapped in the bedding next to him Jack slowly
pulls the sheet down revealing Babette’s sleeping face

JACK
I felt like I was falling through
myself
(pause)
Like a heart stopping plunge

JACK
Someone was here with us Or some
thing

ALFONSE (VO)
It’s natural it’s normal that
decent well-meaning people find
themselves intrigued by catastrophe
when they see it on television

INT COLLEGE CAFETERIA

Jack sits at a table with Murray and a group of professors
mostly New York emigres Alfonse husky with a furious
beard also dressed in a robe sits at the head He’s
accompanied by teachers in his department Nicolas Grappa
Elliot Lasher and the very large Dimitros Cotsakis A sole
female professor sits at an adjacent table This is Winnie
Richards 30s a spindly woman drinking a small carton of
chocolate milk

LASHER
Because we’re suffering from brain

ALFONSE

We need an occasional catastrophe
to break up the incessant
bombardment of information

GRAPPA
The flow is constant Words
pictures numbers facts--graphics
statistics waves particles

LASHER
Only a catastrophe gets our
attention We want them We need
them

Jack leans across the table to get Winnie’s attention

JACK
If I were to get you a pill--

their doom

JACK WINNIE
But in theory Why do you ask me
JACK LASHER
Youre brilliant For most people there are

only two places in the world
Where they live and their TV

set If a thing happens on
television we have every

right to find it fascinating

whatever it is

WINNIE GRAPPA

Were all brilliant Isn’t Youre saying it’s more or
that the understanding around less universal to be

here

fascinated by TV disasters

Murray tries to get Jack’s attention

MURRAY WINNIE
Jack-- You call me brilliant I call
you brilliant We call
Alfonse brilliant and so on
It’s a form of communal ego
GRAPPA
I don’t know whether to feel good
or bad about learning that my
experience is widely shared
JACK
No one calls me brilliant They
call me shrewd They say I latched
on to something big I filled an
opening no one knew existed
ALFONSE
Feel bad
LASHER
It’s obvious We all feel bad But
we can enjoy it on that level
WINNIE
So where’s the pill
JACK LASHER
I have to find it first Did you ever brush your teeth

with your finger

GRAPPA
I brushed my teeth with my finger
the first time I stayed overnight
at my first wife’s parents’ house

ALFONSE
Japan is pretty good for disaster
footage India remains largely
untapped But their disasters tend
to go unrecorded

fight in Zaire That’s the
southernmost point I’ve
brushed my teeth with my
finger at

Murray leans over to Jack and says quietly

MURRAY
Jack I need your help I’ve been
having trouble establishing an
Elvis Presley power base in the
department

JACK
What does Alfonse say

MURRAY
He seems to feel that Cotsakis has
established a prior right
Cotsakis was in Memphis when the
King died He interviewed members
of the entourage and family
For Cotsakis Elvis is just Elvis
But for me Elvis is my Hitler

JACK
(aside to Murray)
How can I help

MURRAY GRAPPA
I thought you might drop by Did you ever crap in a toilet

A white crescent shape appears

It’s the light at the end of a tunnel A speeding train
exits out of the tunnel pulling a series of tank cars behind
it labeled “TOXIC CHEMICALS”

EXT SIDE ROAD BLACKSMITH SAME

INTERCUT with a truck barreling along a side-road We can
hear the driver singing along to “Rubbernecking” by Elvis
Presley

The driver reaches for a bottle of Jack Daniels on the
passenger seat The truck lurches onto the shoulder The
driver quickly grabs the wheel and steers the giant vehicle

back on the road

On the back of the truck in big red letters “FLAMMABLE”
CUT TO

INT HALLWAYMURRAY’S SEMINAR ROOM

Jack steels himself outside the door He wears his robe and
tinted glasses He enters

MURRAY (0S)
Did his mother know that Elvis
would die young

There are twenty-five or thirty young men and women in many
fall colors They sit in armchairs and sofas and on beige

broadloom

Murray walks among them his right hand trembling

in a stylized way

MURRAY
She talked about assassins she
talked about the life the life of
a star of this type of magnitude
Isnt this life structured to cut
you down early This is the point
isn’t it There are rules
guidelines

He spots Jack and nods Jack stands against the wall in the
back attempting to loom his arms folded under the black

gown

MURRAY
Now I have a feeling about
mothers Mothers really do know
The folklore is correct

JACK
Hitler adored his mother He was
the first of Klara’s children to
survive infancy

There’s a surge of attention unspoken among the students
Murray still moving interrupts abruptly

MURRAY
Elvis and Gladys liked to nuzzle
and pet They slept in the same bed
until he began to approach physical
maturity They talked baby-talk to
each other

On impulse Jack abandons his place at the wall and starts to
pace the room like Murray He stops occasionally to gesture
listen or gaze out the window

JACK
Hitler was a lazy kid His report
card was full of unsatisfactorys

MURRAY
Gladys worried about his sleep
walking She lashed out at any kid
who tried to bully him Gladys
walked Elvis to school and back
every day She defended him in
street rumbles

JACK
Klara loved him spoiled him gave
him the attention his father failed
to give him

MURRAY
Elvis confided in Gladys He
brought his girlfriends around to
meet her

Jack and Murray approach each other near the center of the
room almost colliding

JACK
Hitler wrote a poem to his mother
He took piano lessons made
sketches of museums and villas

MURRAY
When Elvis went into the army
Gladys became ill and depressed

JACK
Hitler was what we call a mama’s
boy

MURRAY

Elvis could hardly bear to let
Gladys out of his sight when her
condition grew worse He kept vigil
at the hospital

JACK
When his mother became severely
ill Hitler put a bed in the
kitchen to be closer to
her

JACK MURRAY
He cooked and cleaned Hitler Elvis fell apart when Gladys
wept at the grave and fell died He fondled and petted
into a period of depression her in the casket He talked
and self pity their baby talk

The door opens and Alfonse the chairman of the department
enters followed by Grappa Lasher and other students News
of this dual lecture having reached other classrooms They
all find places to stand or sit

JACK MURRAY
For the rest of his life It seems fairly certain that
Hitler could not bear to be Gladys’ death caused a
anywhere near a Christmas fundamental shift at the
tree center of the King’s world

view

JACK MURRAY
Years later in the grip of Elvis began to withdraw from
self-myth and deep the real world to enter the
remoteness Hitler kept a state of his own dying

portrait of his mother in his
Spartan quarters at
Obersalzberg

JACK
He began to hear a buzzing in
his left ear

Jack and Murray their movement now like a dance circle each
other and head off in opposite directions without even
sharing a look

MURRAY
Elvis fulfilled the terms of the
contract Excess deterioration
self-destructiveness grotesque
behavior a physical bloating and a
series of insults to the brain
self-delivered

Cotsakis watches from outside the glass doors He scoffs
turns and walks away

MURRAY
His place in legend is secure He
bought off the skeptics by dying
early horribly unnecessarily No
one could deny him now His mother
probably saw it all as ona
nineteen-inch screen years before
her own death

Murray arrives at the corner of the room and sits on the
floor Everyone’s eyes on Jack as he takes the stage

JACK
Picture Hitler near the end
trapped in his fiihrerbunker
beneath the burning city He looks
back to the early days of his
power

We CUT TO
EXT COUNTRYSIDE SAME

The speeding train exits a tunnel pulling a series of tank
cars behind it

JACK (VO)
When crowds came--mobs of people
overrunning the courtyard singing
patriotic songs painting swastikas
on the walls on the flanks of farm
animals

CUT TO Crowds at Nazi rallies
EXT SIDE ROAD BLACKSMITH SAME

INTERCUT with a truck barreling along a side-road We can
hear the driver singing along to “Rubbernecking” He
animatedly does the hand claps along to the record The
bottle of Jack Daniels sloshing back and forth on the
passenger seat

INTERCUT with Jack continuing his lecture The crowd rapt

JACK
Crowds came to his mountain villa
so many people that he had to stay
indoors

We INTERCUT more rapidly the three train truck and Jack
The truck driver now singing full throated reaches for the
bottle of whiskey next to him

JACK (VO)
Crowds came to hear him speak
crowds erotically charged the
masses he once called his only
bride

CUT TO Crowds scream at an Elvis concert

The train whistles

Black smoke coughs out of the truck’s pipes

The driver strains to reach the whiskey bottle while
glancing back periodically at the road The truck lurches
and he has to quickly right the wheel

On Jack intense

JACK
Crowds came to be hypnotized by the
voice the party anthems the
torchlight parades

Jack his back to the class stares at the carpet and counts
silently to seven mouthing the words

JACK
But wait How familiar this all
seems to us how close to ordinary

The driver grabs the bottle Elvis singing

JACK
Crowds come get worked up touch
and press - people eager to be
transported Isn’t this ordinary
We all know this We’ve been part
of those crowds There must have
been something different about
these crowds What was it Let me
whisper the terrible word from the
Old English from the Old German
from the Old Norse Death Those
crowds were assembled in the name
of death

The driver looks up--

The railway crossing arm dropped down in front of him Bing
bing bing The truck blasts through the arm shattering A
siren rings

CLOSE on the driver’s wide eyes--
On Jack

JACK
They were there to attend tributes
to the dead But not the already
dead They were not mourning
brothers fathers husbands those
who had fought and died But the
not yet dead The future dead
The living dead amongst us

The train brakes The mammoth engine sliding metal
screeching--

JACK (VO)
Processions songs speeches
dialogues with the dead
recitations of the names of the
dead

--as the truck collides directly with the train tank Train
cars topple as the truck is pushed down the track Shrieks
and roars come from the mechanical beasts The truck and
train soar off the track ripping through the grass and dirt
Dark smoke and fire bursts into the air

JACK (VO)
They were there to see pyres and
flaming wheels thousands of flags
dipped in salute thousands of
uniformed mourners

Close on Jack

JACK
They were ranks and squadrons
elaborate backdrops blood banners
and black dress uniforms Crowds
came to form a shield against their
own dying To break off from the
crowd is to risk death as an
individual to face dying alone

CUT TO Another small explosion then fire and smoke erupts
from the wreck

Jack finishes big

JACK
To become a crowd is to keep out
death Crowds came for this reason
above all others They were there
to be a crowd

The students and faculty break into applause

The applause and “Rubbernecking” and the fiery crash sounds
spin together into one distorted dark din

People have gathered around Jack students and staff creating
a crowd themselves Jack’s momentum now blurred as his
breaths grow ragged joining the growing dissonant
soundtrack as people jostle and touch him

CUT TO Fires rage from the crash site billowing smoke into
the air and toward the horizon

A door slides open and men in silver Mylex suits jump out
Wide to reveal the van the men heading toward

Part II THE AIRBORNE TOXIC EVENT
We’re moving backwards down a neighborhood street

JACK (VO)
May the days be aimless Let the
seasons drift Do not advance the
action according to a plan

EXT GLADNEYS’ STREET BLACKSMITH EVENING

The atmosphere is clear and still An evening light casts a
glow on the neighborhood A distant siren

Jack drags a large garbage bag to the bin at the curb In
the stillness of the night we can hear a woman in a
neighboring house on the phone

WOMAN
A decongestant an antihistamine a
cough suppressant a pain reliever--

The sound of a baseball hitting a mitt A father and son
play catch across the street A couple talks on their porch
Kids play a game in the driveway The neighbor waves Jack
responds

A siren moves closer Jack’s attention follows the sound

We ZOOM to a small ledge outside the attic window of the
Gladney’s house Heinrich in a camouflage jacket and cap is
crouched peering through binoculars He looks somewhere off
to the east

A low rumble of thunder in the distance

INT GLADNEY’S ATTIC EVENING

The room is cluttered by abandoned possessions Exposed
beams and posts and fiberglass insulation pads Jack enters
Heinrich is now inside standing by the open window still

looking through the glasses

JACK
Hey what do you see out there

HEINRICH
The radio said a tank car derailed
But I don’t think it derailed from
what I could see

JACK HEINRICH
What did you-- I think it got rammed and
something punched a hole in
it There’s a lot of smoke
and I don’t like the looks of
it

JACK
What does it look like

Heinrich hands his father the binoculars and steps aside
Jack brings the binoculars up to his eyes--

His POV A shapeless black mass hangs in the air above the
river Lights blink on a radio tower in the foreground

JACK
You see fire engines or--

HEINRICH
They’re all over the place But it
looks to me like they’re not
getting too close It must be
pretty toxic or pretty explosive
stuff or both

Jack’s POV shifts down and follows a small emergency vehicle
the siren flashing heading toward the site of the cloud
Jack puts down the binoculars and hands them back to his son

JACK
(reassuringly)
It won’t come this way

HEINRICH
How do you know

JACK
It just won’t The point is you
shouldn’t be standing on slippery
ledges It worries Baba

HEINRICH
You think if you tell me it worries
her I’1l feel guilty and not do
it But if you tell me it worries
you I’1l do it all the time

JACK
Shut the window

INT KITCHEN

Jack is paying bills at the table Steffie looks through the
brightly colored mail separating coupons lotteries and
contests The sound of blue jeans tumbling in the dryer down
the hall

RADIO (VO)
Available for a limited time only
with optional megabyte hard disk

JACK
Did you finish your homework
already

STEFFIE

Can you see the feathery plume from
the attic window

JACK
It’s not a plume
STEFFIE
But will we have to leave our
homes
JACK STEFFIE
Of course not How do you know
JACK
I just know
STEFFIE STEFFIE
What about that time there And we had to evacuate

was that leak at our school

JACK
That was inside This is outside

Police sirens come and go somewhere in the area Steffie’s
lips soundlessly form the siren sequence “Wow wow wow”

She sees her father watching her and smiles caught in her

own reverie

DENISE (0S)
They’re using leaf-blowers to blow
stuff onto the spill

Denise enters the room wearing her green visor and wiping
her palms on her jeans

STEFFIE DENISE
What kind of stuff I don’t know but it’s
supposed to make the spill
harmless which doesn’t
explain what they’re doing
about the actual plume

JACK
They’re keeping it from getting
bigger When do we eat

STEFFIE DENISE
I don’t know (concerned)
If it gets any bigger it’1ll
get here with or without a
wind

JACK
It won’t get here

DENISE
How do you know

JACK
Because it won’t

Heinrich enters with a portable radio and a highway map

HEINRICH
The radio calls it a feathery
plume But it’s not a plume

STEFFIE DENISE
That’s what Dad said What is it

HEINRICH
Like a shapeless growing thing A
dark black breathing thing of
smoke

STEFFIE
Why do they call it a plume then

JACK
Air time is valuable They can’t
go into long tortured descriptions

DENISE
Have they said what kind of
chemical it is

HEINRICH
It’s called Nyodene Derivative or
Nyodene D It was in a movie we
saw in school on toxic wastes

DENISE JACK
Those videotaped rats What does it cause

HEINRICH
The movie wasn’t sure what it does
to humans Mainly it was rats
growing urgent lumps

JACK
That’s what the movie said What
does the radio say

HEINRICH
They said skin irritation and
sweaty palms

STEFFIE
Sweaty palms in rats
HEINRICH DENISE
Humans The radio not the movie
HEINRICH

But then they updated it to nausea
vomiting shortness of breath

STEFFIE
The radio or the movie
HEINRICH JACK
Both Well it won’t come this way
HEINRICH

How do you know

JACK
I just know It’s perfectly calm
and still today And when there’s
a wind this time of year it blows
that way not this way

DENISE

What if it blows this way
JACK

It wont
STEFFIE

But what if just this one time

JACK
It won’t Why should it

Heinrich the radio pressed to his ear

HEINRICH
They just closed part of the
interstate

JACK
They would want to do that of
course

HEINRICHDENISESTEFFIE
WhyWhyWhy would they

JACK
They just would It’s a sensible
precaution

Babette enters the kitchen on a cordless phone

BABETTE
H--hold on Helen Jack is here
JACK BABETTE

(finishing his thought (holding her hand over

to the kids) the mouth-piece)
It’s a way to facilitate The Stovers say the spill
movement of service vehicles from the tank car was thirty-
and such Any number of five

reasons that have nothing to
do with wind or wind
direction

We hear Helen faintly through the phone repeating with
variation “thirty-eight thousand”

BABETTE
-thousand gallons She says her
girls were complaining of sweaty
palms

HEINRICH
There’s been a correction Tell
them they ought to be throwing up

Heinrich heads out of the room with his radio The rumble of
a helicopter passes over them and disappears Denise looks
at her palms blows on them and follows her brother Steffie
lingers in the kitchen unsure what to do with her anxiety

Jack finishes paying a bill He periodically glances up at
Babette who is still on the phone and who is watching him
studying his face

BABETTE
(into the phone)
Is anyone nauseous OKOK
Thanks HelenYeah stay in touch

She hangs up

BABETTE
The Stovers spoke directly with the
weather center outside Glassboro
They’re not calling it a feathery
plume anymore

STEFFIE
What are they calling it

BABETTE
A black billowing cloud

JACK
That’s more accurate which means
they’re coming to grips with the
thing Good

The grinding sound of the disposal in the sink startles him
Steffie washes her hands vigorously in the kitchen sink

BABETTE
It’s expected that some sort of air
mass may be moving down from
Canada

JACK
There’s always an air mass moving
down from Canada

BABETTE
That’s true There’s certainly
nothing new in that

JACK
And since Canada is to the north
if the billowing cloud is blown due
south it will miss us by a
comfortable margin When do we
eat

Sirens pass by again A larger sound this time An air raid
siren Steffie having finished washing her hands hurries
upstairs water dripping in her wake

BABETTE
Maybe we ought to be more concerned
about the billowing cloud I know
we don’t want to scare the kids--

Babette starts taking things out of the refrigerator

JACK
Nothing is going to happen

BABETTE
I know nothing is going to happen
you know nothing is going to
happen But at some level we ought
to think about it just in case

Jack grabs her thigh as she passes him at the table She
falls into his lap wrapped around him in such a way that he
can read the box of corn niblets in her left hand

BABETTE
It’s just when do we know when
this is real

JACK
These things happen to people who
live in exposed areas Society is
set up I mean sadly in such a way
that it’s the poor and the
uneducated who suffer the main
impact of natural and man-made
disasters

BABETTE
It is sad

JACK
Did you ever see a college
professor rowing a boat down his
own street in one of those TV
floods

BABETTE
(smiles)
Why do you want dinner so early

JACK
I missed lunch

BABETTE
Shall I do some chili-fried
chicken

JACK
First-rate

BABETTE
Where is Wilder

He tries to undo her bra through her blouse with his teeth

JACK
I don’t know

BABETTE
I ironed your gown

JACK
Thank you

CLOSE on Jack’s POV of the corn serving suggestions

BABETTE
Did you pay the phone bill

JACK
I can’t find it I paid the gas
and electricity though

BABETTE
(standing)
Let’s think about the billowing
cloud just a little bit OK What
if it’s dangerous

She goes to the freezer

JACK
Everything in train tank cars is
dangerous But the effects are
mainly long-range--

BABETTE
So we die later

JACK
We don’t die Not from this All
we have to do is stay out of the
way

BABETTE
Let’s just be sure to keep it in
the back of our mind

She smashes the ice cube tray repeatedly on the rim of the
sink dislodging the cubes

INTEXT ATTIC SAME

Jack reenters Heinrich listens to the radio Wilder hoists
himself up on an old Christmas tree stand

JACK
Here’s Wilder Baba’s making chili-
fried chicken

HEINRICH
They’re calling it a black
billowing cloud now

JACK
That’s what the Stovers said It’s
good

Jack opens the window taking the binoculars from around
Heinrich’s neck

HEINRICH
Why is it good

JACK
(climbing out on the
ledge)
I told your sister they’re looking
the thing more squarely in the eye
Can you spot me--

Heinrich grabs the back of Jack’s belt and holds him against
the building to prevent him from slipping Jack places the
glasses up to his face

The radio continues muffled now from Jack’s earshot

His POV The cloud is larger and closer than before The
radio tower previously in the foreground is swallowed up in
darkness Floodlights sweep across the horizon Army
helicopters hover Colored lights from police cruisers
crisscross the wider beams

Jack lowers the glasses

JACK
OK

Heinrich clutches his belt as Jack crawls back inside

JACK
(trying not to display
anxiety)
Wellit’s still hanging there
(pause)

(MORE)

JACK (CONTD)
Looks rooted to the spot Make
sure Wilder doesn’t get into that
insulation there

Heinrich hurries to lift up Wilder away from the exposed
silver and pink cushions

HEINRICH
So you’re saying you don’t think it
will come this way

JACK
I can tell by your voice you know
something I don’t know

HEINRICH
Do you think it will come this way
or not

Heinrich places Wilder on the other side of the room from the
insulation Wilder immediately starts wobbling back

JACK
You want me to say it won’t come
this way and then you’ll attack
with your fistful of data What
did they say on the radio while I
was out there

HEINRICH
It doesn’t cause nausea vomiting
shortness of breath like they said
before

JACK
What does it cause

HEINRICH
Heart palpitations and a sense of
deja vu

JACK
Deja vu Come on

HEINRICH
It affects the false part of the
human brain or whatever

JACK HEINRICH
I don’t believe that That’s not all They’re not
calling it the black
billowing cloud anymore

JACK
What are they calling it

Heinrich looks at his dad carefully

HEINRICH
(dramatically)
The airborne toxic event

JACK
(hesitates)
Names are not important The
important thing is location It’s
there We’re here

HEINRICH
A large air mass is moving down
from Canada

JACK
We already knew that
(noticing)
Wilder

Wilder is crawling backwards out the door and out of sight

HEINRICH
That doesn’t mean it’s not
important

Jack kneels down to Wilder’s level and watches him carefully
climb down the steep attic steps

JACK
Maybe it is maybe it isn’t
Depends

Jack looks up Heinrich now standing over him

HEINRICH
(plaintive)
The weather is about to change

INT DINING ROOM

The family eats dinner The meal the fried chicken looks
delicious Everyone tries to establish a normal cozy vibe
despite faraway sirens and the general anxious mood

DENISE
Arent we eating a little early
tonight

The sirens get closer until they’re upon them wrapping the
house in sound and then moving ahead and further away

BABETTE
What do you call early

Denise and Steffie meet eyes
DENISE

Is it because we want to get it out
of the way

BABETTE
What do we want to get out of the
way

STEFFIE

In case something happens

BABETTE
Like what

The girls share a solemn look again

JACK
This is delicious Baba
(to Denise)
Youre not eating honey

Denise claps a hand to her mouth and runs from the table

BABETTE
Honey are you OK

They hear her retching incompletely in the bathroom off the
hall

HEINRICH
She’s showing outdated symptoms

They go on eating exhibiting excessive politeness in the
process The family din diminishing as the sirens and
squawks escalate

JACK
Baba could you pass more of the
corn

BABETTE
(handing it to her
husband)
Sure

JACK
Thank you so much
Silence Denise returns looking pale

BABETTE
Are you feeling better

Jack starts to say--

JACK
These peppers have a wonderful--

Suddenly a different more present air raid siren sounds
shaking and startling them all Jack immediately starts
clearing the table avoiding eye contact with anyone else

JACK HEINRICH
What do we have for dessert (leaping to his feet)
I think that came from the
firehouse
BABETTE

Ive never heard that sound before

JACK (0S)
Amazing that little red brick
building can make such a squawk

And again the squawk now even louder Heinrich runs to the
front door and opens it Light and sound blast into the
house A voice an announcement embedded in the din

Jack returns with sponge cake and canned peaches Heinrich
hurries in with a quick but deliberate walk

HEINRICH
They want us to evacuate

BABETTE
(standing)
Did you get the impression they
were only making a suggestion or
was it a little more mandatory do
you think

HEINRICH
It was a fire captain’s car with a
loudspeaker and it was going pretty
fast

JACK
(eating a sliced peach)
In other words you didn’t have an
opportunity to notice the subtle
edges of intonation

HEINRICH BABETTE
The voice was screaming out Due to the sirens

HEINRICH
It said something like “Evacuate
all places of residence Cloud of
deadly chemicals cloud of deadly
chemicals”

Steffie starts crying Jack puts his hand on her shoulder

JACK
It’s OK baby

Denise pushes her chair back and runs upstairs Heinrich
follows her Babette heads to the kitchen

Denise runs from room to room throwing clothes into bags

DENISE
Has anyone seen my ski mask

Heinrich climbs the attic stairs two at a time He grabs the
binoculars his camouflage hat the highway map and radio

As he takes the radio it reveals Jack’s discarded banana
peel and a stack of books on the occult

Babette grabs tins and jars from the pantry (Itemsbrands
we recognize from their shops at the supermarket)

Jack confused balances plates somewhere between the dining
room and kitchen

BABETTE (0S)
Jack just leave it

EXT GLADNEY HOUSESTREET

A light rain falls They all head out into the night
hurriedly throwing the bags and other random things they
packed into the car

DENISE
(wearing her visor)
I couldn’t find my ski mask

BABETTE DENISE
Why do you need a ski mask It just seems like a thing
you take in these kinds of
things

Lights circle and dance off the buildings The loudspeaker
and sirens continuing somewhere nearby

DENISE
(hesitates looks around)
Everyone’s gone already

She’s right other houses are dark driveways empty

STEFFIE
(afraid)
We’re late

EXT MAIN STREET
The lone car sails down the hill The streets are empty
INT STATION WAGON

Jack drives in a controlled hurry on the residential streets
The wipers going as the rain increases He punches buttons
on the radio trying to get some information We move around
the car from face to face

RADIO VOICE
-from the east are to take the
parkway to the fourth service area
where they would proceed to a
restaurant called Kung Fu Palace

STEFFIE
Is that the place with lily ponds
and live deer

BABETTE DENISE
That’s right Steffie Where do we go

JACK
They’1l tell us

DENISE
Can we play my mix

BABETTE
Later honey

Everyone is silent Steffie says aloud

STEFFIE
Was this a mild winter or a harsh
winter

BABETTE

Compared to what

I don’t know People from the west end--
HEINRICH
This is us--
DENISE RADIO VOICE
Shh --Of town should head for

the Boy Scout camp on Highway-
10 called Camp Daffodil

where Red Cross volunteers
will dispense juice and
coffee

JACK
OK we have a plan

They turn a corner and Jack slams on the brakes

JACK
Shit

They all thrust forward and back Cars are lined up in front
of them slowed to a brutal crawl as traffic getting onto the
main route is at a standstill Denise leans forward and
hands her dad a cassette tape

Heinrich looks out the back window The world of sycamores
and tall hedges left behind A helicopter circles

WIDE of the line of cars and lights snaking onto the main
route past a gauntlet of used car lots fast food chains
discount drugs and quad cinemas An ambulance squawks stuck
in the endless traffic

In the car The kids scan the faces of people in adjacent
cars

JACK
Things should pick up some miles
ahead where it turns into four
lanes

STEFFIE
They don’t look scared in the Crown
Victoria

DENISE

Yeah they’re laughing
HEINRICH

These guys aren’t laughing
STEFFIE

Where
HEINRICH

In the Country Squire

DENISE
They look devastated

JACK
What does it matter what they’re
doing in other cars

STEFFIE
I want to know how scared we should
be

BABETTE

I think we just don’t know at this
point Stef

STEFFIE
That makes me more scared

BABETTE
Don’t be scared
(aside to Jack)
Nobody is coming in the opposite

direction
JACK STEFFIE
Police must have halted Where are the police Did
traffic coming this way they just leave us to figure
this out on our own
JACK
(vaguely)

They’re around

CUT TO The rain falls harder They pass a home furnishing
mart with sale signs lit up from the inside People inside
staring out the huge window at the slowly passing cars

DENISE
Why are they shopping for furniture
during an airborne event

HEINRICH BABETTE
There’s a sale Maybe they know something we
dont

Jack hits more buttons on the radio

DENISE
Maybe there’s no way out
HEINRICH
Maybe it’s raining Nyodene D
STEFFIE RADIO VOICE
Is that possible People indoors are being

asked to stay indoors

BABETTE
Why would they say that

DENISE
We were told to leave

They slowly approach an overpass people on foot march
along They carry boxes suitcases blankets They cradle
pets and small children Some children are pulled on sleds
and wagons There’s a family wrapped completely in plastic
walking in lock step

RADIO VOICE
Convulsions coma miscarriage

They move beneath the overpass Some cars mount the grassy
incline at the edge of the road creating a third lane of
severely tilted traffic

STEFFIE
They’re passing us Dad

JACK
Technically that’s illegal

As Jack turns back to his family up ahead a car skids off
the grassy incline its nose hitting the pavement as it flips
over and crashes into a car in their lane Jack brakes and
everyone screams

The traffic now funnels into one lane A helicopter above
them shining a white beam down on the mass of collapsed
metal Dazed occupants look out from both cars Rescue
workers swarm the scene Heinrich watches with his
binoculars

HEINRICH
Baba cooked chili-fried chicken for
dinner Dad’s favorite Dad said
not to worry the plume will not
come to us But it wasn’t a plume
it was an airborne toxic event

Blood on a smashed window

HEINRICH (0S)
We packed in a hurry We ran to
the car only to realize we were
latecomers to an evacuation

Blood soaked through a white coat Drops of blood on a tan
handbag

And then the scene in WIDE of injured people smoking steel
washed in an eerie white light (These images are almost
beautiful in composition)

JACK
(to Babette)
Is this just everything that
happened

BABETTE
Shh

Jack realizes his family wife and daughters Wilder even
all pay close attention to the story They look riveted

HEINRICH
(with spirited enjoyment)
The rain pelted the roof of our
station wagon Pip pip pip We
hit traffic as we left the comfort
of sycamores and hedges

He goes on about the people in other cars the crash they
just saw

HEINRICH
Dad searched for information on the
radio Traffic lined up on the
freeway like lighted up dominos
We passed people in distress An
unspoken bond with our fellow
journeyman formed and then a
crash

They pass a Winnebago and a tractor intertwined Rusty smoke
coming from the scrap-metal

BABETTE
Oh those poor people

HEINRICH
A car flipped on the road people
ran to their aid we were waved by
only able to watch with sympathy
and awe

As they finally pass the accident Jack looks across Babette
in the passenger seat to the crash site In the foreground
Babette out of focus slips something into her mouth Slowly
she comes into focus as she swallows whatever it was she
placed in her mouth

JACK
What’s that

BABETTE
Drive the car Jack

JACK
I saw your throat contract You
swallowed something

BABETTE
Just a Life Saver Keep your eyes
on--

JACK

You place a Life Saver in your
mouth and you swallow it without an
interval of sucking

BABETTE
Swallow what It’s still in my
mouth

She thrusts her face at him using her tongue to make a small
lump in her cheek

JACK
But you swallowed something I
saw

BABETTE

That was just saliva that I didn’t
know what to do with Drive the
car would you

Jack finds Denise’s eyes in the rearview mirror and decides
to leave it for now He turns the wipers on a higher speed
as the rain increases

JACK
What’s he want

A Mylex-suited man is waving them to merge to avoid another
huge wreck

They pass a sign for the Most Photographed Barn in America

HEINRICH
We’re running out of gas

Jack looks at the dial quivering on E

BABETTE
There’s always extra
HEINRICH BABETTE
How can there be extra That’s the way the tank is
constructed so you don’t run
out
HEINRICH

There can’t be always extra If
you keep going you run out

BABETTE
You don’t keep going forever
HEINRICH
How do we know when to stop
JACK
(smiling)

When you pass a gas station

STEFFIE
Look

Their station wagon drives into the deserted and rain-swept
plaza with a gas station and pumps standing beneath an array
of multicolor banners

Jack leaps out of the car and runs around to the pumps with
his head tucked under the raised collar of his coat A door
from the office swings open and shut

JACK
Nobody’s here

Nobody hears or reacts from the car He checks the nozzle
it’s unlocked He seizes the hose from the unleaded pump
The banners smacking in the wind

JACK
It’s working

Headlights from the road slowly creep by in the darkness He
regards his family through the rain-streaked windows the
kids horsing around Babette laughing He waits while the
tank fills The gas station sign on stilts is lit up behind
Jack in the night sky

We see but he doesn’t The presence of a wide dark shadow as

it passes over the tall Shell gas station sign The banners
suddenly stop flapping The rain slows to a drip The door
stops swinging Jack hesitates

And then the Shell icon reappears out of the black The wind
picks up the flags wagging the rain falls again The
nozzle clicks Full

RADIO VOICE
dogs trained to sniff out
Nyodene D are en route to the area
from a chemical detection center in
New Mexico

STEFFIE (V0O)
You didn’t pay Dad

CUT TO They’re back on the road

JACK
There was nobody there

STEFFIE
You could have left some money on
the counter

JACK DENISE
I was in a hurry I’11 send What happens if the dogs get
them a check contaminated
STEFFIE
Yeah but you probably wont do
that
BABETTE

Nothing happens to dogs

DENISE
How do you know

BABETTE
Ask Jack
JACK
Ask Heinrich

HEINRICH
(probably bullshitting)
It could be true They use rats to
test for things that humans can
catch so it means we get the same
diseases rats and humans

BABETTE
Besides they wouldn’t use dogs if
they thought it could hurt them

DENISE
Why not
BABETTE
A dog is a mammal
DENISE
So is a rat
BABETTE HEINRICH
A rat is a vermin Mostly what a rat is is a
rodent
BABETTE STEFFIE
It’s also a vermin A cockroach is a vermin
BABETTE

A cockroach is an insect You
count the legs is how you know

STEFFIE
It’s also a vermin

JACK
(to himself)
Family is the cradle of the world’s
misinformation

Jack drives slowly up an incline in the road
strangely dark

DENISE
Does a cockroach get cancer No
That must mean a rat is more like a
human than it is like a cockroach
even if they’re both vermins since
a rat and a human can get cancer
but a cockroach can’t

The sky is

HEINRICH
In other words she’s saying that
two things that are mammals have
more in common than two things that
are only vermins

As the car climbs further Jack can see that the dark sky is
moving up against a blue night

BABETTE
Are you telling me that a rat is
not only a vermin and a rodent but
a mammal too

JACK
Oh shit

Suddenly lit up in the sky ahead of them is--
--the black billowing cloud itself

As the family looks their car is hit with bright white
light A helicopter flies with a spot above them dragging
its spot across the traffic and up into the air revealing

The airborne toxic event lighted by the clear beams of seven
army helicopters a roiling bloated slug-shaped mass There
are cracklings and sputterings flashes of light long
looping streaks of chemical flame It seems to be generating
its own inner storms

The helicopters throb like giant appliances The cloud is
silver-tipped in the spotlights as it moves horribly through
the night

The family watches from the car in humble awe Heinrich
fumbles to load his camera with film Jack starts to say
something but can’t Babette grabs his hand He startles
then takes it

HEINRICH
You can look at it and look at it

Denise and Steffie fight over the binoculars

BABETTE
Come on kids share please

Other drivers honk Adults and children crowded at their
windows pink hands pressed against the glass Cars have
pulled up on the median people outside watching

WIDE as flares come swooning from the helicopters creamy
bursts of red and white light

The traffic lead by the streaking headlights in the rain
snakes off to the right leaving the remarkable billowing
cloud in the background

DISSOLVE TO Lights speckled through a water streaked window
It’s an hour or so later The rain has stopped Steffie and
Wilder sleep A single lane funnels into the Boy Scout Camp
Mylex suited men surrounded by Day-Glo pylons wave
flashlights directing them to a packed parking lot and onto
an athletic field

MAN IN MYLEX SUIT
Welcome to Camp Daffodil

The car bumps along dirt paths over ruts and mounds Near
the main buildings there is a group of men and women not
wearing Mylex suits who carry clip-boards and walkie-
talkies Denise Heinrich Babette look out their windows
glancing periodically at the night sky Lights passing over
their reflections in the glass

INT BOY SCOUT BARRACK

A large gray area dank and bare and crowded with people
some on beach chairs brought from home others on designated
camp folding chairs It’s lit with overhead flood lights as
well as small kerosene lamps The Red Cross has set up cots
and portable heaters and volunteers come around with
sandwiches and coffee Nurses tend to some elderly people

Many radios go at once with talk and some music Certain
people hold court to smaller gatherings We hear various
theories in the air

“T hear we’ll be allowed to go home first thing in the
morning” “The government knows much more than they’re
saying” “A helicopter entered the toxic cloud and never
reappeared” “The dogs are here from New Mexico They
parachuted into a meadow in a daring night drop” “The town
of Farmington will be uninhabitable for forty years” “There
are nine evacuation centers” “The governor is on his way to
the capitol in an executive helicopter”

We find Jack drinking coffee from a styrofoam cup
We hear Babette’s voice She’s seated some distance away

reading from a tabloid magazine to many elderly people from
her posture class

BABETTE
»a researcher at the world-
renowned institute has used
hypnosis to induce hundreds of
people to recall their previous-
life experiences as pyramid-
builders exchange students and
extraterrestrials

Jack walks among the evacuees more theories abound He
hesitates as he hears

VOICE
The stuff they sprayed on the big
spill was probably soda ash But
it was a case of too little too
late

Jack hovers at the outside of the small group It is in
fact Heinrich at the center speaking in an enthusiastic
tone Relishing in his way runaway calamity

HEINRICH
My guess is they’ll get some crop
dusters up in the air at daybreak
and bombard the toxic cloud with
lots more soda ash which could
break it up and scatter it into a
million harmless puffs Soda ash
is the common name for sodium
carbonate which is used in the
manufacture of glass ceramics
detergents and soaps It’s also
what they use to make bicarbonate
of soda something a lot of you
have probably guzzled after a night
on the town

Laughter The group grows Jack getting shoved further back

HEINRICH
What you’re all probably wondering
is what exactly is this Nyodene D
we keep hearing about Well I’m
glad you asked that

More laughter As he continues Jack retreats so as not to
be seen

Steffie and Wilder are asleep in one of the cots Denise
lies on her cot reading the Physicians Desk Reference
Babette goes through a canvas bag full of jars and cartons
from their refrigerator and pantry Denise looks up
JACK (0S)
Heinrich seems to be coming out of
his shell

Jack takes a seat on a cot

BABETTE
Where is he I haven’t seen him

JACK
See that knot of people He’s
right in the middle He’s telling
them what he knows about the toxic
event

BABETTE
What does he know

JACK
Quite a lot it turns out

BABETTE
Why didn’t he tell us

JACK
He probably doesn’t think it’s
worth his while to be funny and
charming in front of his family
We present the wrong kind of
challenge

BABETTE
Don’t you think you ought to go
over there Show him that his
father is there for his big moment

JACK
He’1l only get upset if he sees me

BABETTE
What if I went over

JACK
He’1l think I sent you

BABETTE
Is that so awful

Jack leans in even closer Their heads almost touching

JACK
Just a Life Saver

BABETTE
What

JACK
Just some saliva that you didn’t
know what to do with

BABETTE
It was a Life Saver

She makes an O with her thumb and index finger

JACK
Give me one

BABETTE
It was the last one

At the front hall of the structure a woman is saying
something about exposure to toxic agents Her small voice is
lost in the shuffling roar of the barracks

JACK
What flavor--quick

BABETTE
Cherry

Jack frustrated breaks the intimate moment and stands up
his attention caught by the woman’s half-heard announcement

ANNOUNCEMENT
and if you believe you’ve been
exposed to the airborne toxic event
for any amount of time longer than
ten seconds please proceed to the--

Denise now appears at her Dad’s side

DENISE
Didn’t you hear what the voice
said

JACK

Something about exposure

DENISE
That’s right

JACK
What’s that got to do with us

DENISE
Not us You

JACK
Why me

DENISE
Aren’t you the one who got out of
the car to fill the gas tank

JACK
But the airborne event wasn’t on
top of us then

DENISE
It was ahead of us Remember you
got back in the car and then there
it was in all those lights

JACK
Beautiful

DENISE
Yes

JACK

Youre saying when I got out of the
car the cloud may have been close
enough to rain all over me

DENISE
It’s not your fault but you were
practically right in it for two and
a half minutes

CUT TO Two lines form at the front of the barracks A to M
and N to Z At the end of each line is a folding table with
a micro computer on it Technicians mill about men and
women with lapel badges and color coded armbands

A gaunt young man with a khaki jacket the word SIMUVAC on
his armband talks to Jack He types as Jack gives his name
etc A family of four in bright orange life-jackets talks
to a female technician (the woman with the small voice) in
the N to Z line She seems to be giving only good news to
people

TECHNICIAN
How long were you out there

A woman behind Jack starts sobbing
JACK
Denise said two and a half minutes

Is that considered long or short

He regards Jack with a grimily superior air

TECHNICIAN
Anything that puts you into skin
and orifice contact with the actual
emissions means we have a
situation This is Nyodene D A
whole new generation of toxic
waste State of the art One part
per million can send a rat into a
permanent state

JACK
What about people in the car I
had to open the door to get out and
get back in

TECHNICIAN
Id say their situation is they’re
minimal risks It’s the two anda
half minutes standing right in it
which makes me wince

JACK
(nods )
What does SIMUVAC stand for

TECHNICIAN
It’s short for simulated
evacuation A new state program
they’re battling over funds for

JACK
But this evacuation isn’t
simulated It’s real

TECHNICIAN
We know that But we thought we
could use it as a model

JACK
Are you saying you saw a chance to
use the real event in order to
rehearse the simulation

TECHNICIAN
We took it right to the streets

JACK
How is it going

TECHNICIAN
The insertion curve isn’t as smooth

as we would like
(MORE)

TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
We don’t have our victims laid out
where we’d want them if this was an
actual simulation You have to
make allowances for the fact that
everything we see tonight is real
There’s still a lot of polishing we
have to do but that’s what this
exercise is all about

JACK
What about the computers Is that
real data you’re running through
the system or is it just practice
stuff

TECHNICIAN
You watch

He taps on the keys and studies the codes and responses on
the data screen He frowns and types some more This goes
on longer than is comfortable In the other line the life
jacketed family laughs and thanks the female technician
warmly and walks away They look at Jack sympathetically
Jack folds his arms and tries not to feel self-conscious

JACK
(idly)
I was only out there two and a half
minutes That’s how many seconds

TECHNICIAN (0S)
I’m getting bracketed numbers with
pulsing stars

JACK
(his attention returning)
What does that mean

The man makes a silencing gesture as something grabs his
interest on the screen The female technician chats amiably
with another family

JACK
I meanam I going to die

TECHNICIAN
Not as such

JACK
What do you mean

TECHNICIAN
Not in so many words

JACK
How many words does it take

TECHNICIAN
It’s not a question of words It’s
a question of years We’1ll know
more in fifteen years In the
meantime we definitely have a
situation

JACK
What will we know in fifteen years

TECHNICIAN
If you’re still alive at that time
well know much more than we do
now Nyodene D has a life span of
roughly thirty years You’1l have
made it halfway through

JACK
So to outlive this substance I
will have to make it into my
seventies Then I can begin to
relax

TECHNICIAN
(looks at Jack carefully)

I wouldn’t worry about what I can’t
see or feel I’d go ahead and live
my life Get married settle down
have kids There’s no reason you
can’t do these things knowing what
we know

JACK
But you said we have a situation

TECHNICIAN
I didn’t say it The computer did

JACK
And what the computer says is not a
simulation despite that armband
youre wearing It is real

TECHNICIAN
It is real

EXT BARRACKS
Several groups of people stand around fires burning in fifty-

gallon drums Some people sleep in their cars Or in
makeshift camps and tents

A man sells soft drinks and sandwiches from an open-sided
vehicle Parked nearby are buses motorcycles ambulettes
Beams of light swing slowly through the woods

RADIO VOICE
Hog futures have declined in
sympathy adding bearishness to
that market

Jack passes a carload of prostitutes from Iron City The
interior light is on illuminating their faces at the windows
A man leans against the front door on the drivers side
speaking through a small opening in the window and taking
notes

Jack smiles The man is Murray

JACK
Murray

MURRAY
All white people have a favorite
Elvis song

JACK
(greeting him)
I thought you were going to New
York for the holiday

Murray removes his glove to shake Jack’s hand

MURRAY

I stayed to look at car crash
movies

(re the car of women)
I heard a rumor about painted women
and came out to take notes One of
them says she has a snap-off
crotch What do you think she
means by that

JACK
Well they don’t seem busy

MURRAY
I don’t think this is the kind of
disaster that leads to sexual
abandon We might get one or two
fellows skulking out eventually
but there won’t be an orgiastic
horde not tonight anyway

Murray takes Jack’s arm and they stroll past clusters of
people around the oil drums

More rumors are overheard “Three of the live deer at Kung Fu
Palace are dead” “The governor is dead his pilot and co-
pilot seriously injured”

MURRAY
Any episodes of deja vu in your
group

JACK
No

MURRAY

(pause again)
Any episodes of deja vu in your
family

Jack hesitates

MURRAY
Why do we think these things
happened before Simple They did
happen before in our minds as
visions of the future

JACK
Super natural stuff

MURRAY

(gently)
Maybe when we die the first thing
well say is “I know this feeling
I was here before”

(Murray hesitates taking

in his friend)
How are you doing

Jack hesitates

JACK
I’m dying Murray I spent two and
a half minutes exposed to the toxic
cloud

Murray squeezes Jack’s arm

JACK
Even if it doesn’t kill me ina
direct way it will outlive me in
my own body I could die ina
plane crash and the Nyodene D
would be thriving as my remains
were laid to rest A computer told
me

He stops and looks sadly into Jack’s eyes

MURRAY
I am truly sorry my friend But
computers make mistakes Carpet
static can cause a mistake--

JACK
It was in the barrack there was no
carpet-——

MURRAY

Lint or hair in the circuits Was

the man behind the computer bald
(Jack nods)

Was he wearing a sweater Jack

there are always mistakes

JACK
(emotional)
Thank you Murray

MURRAY
It’s hard to make friends as adults
and it’s all the more special when
it happens

JACK
Not a word to Babette about any of
this She’d be devastated

MURRAY
Of course

JACK
Sometimes I actually think I see it
coming for me At night usually
The thing I’ve always feared And
now it’s here

MURRAY
We’re all aware there’s no escape
from death And how do we deal
with this crushing knowledge We
repress we disguise But you
don’t know how to repress

The fires have burned down in the drums The sandwich vendor
shutters down his van

JACK
I wish there was something I could
do I wish I could out-think the
problem

MURRAY
You thought Hitler would protect
you Some people are larger than
life Hitler is larger than death
I understand completely

JACK
Do you Because I wish I did

MURRAY
It’s totally obvious The
overwhelming horror would leave no
room for your own death It was a
daring thing you did a daring
thrust Daring but dumb

JACK
If I could just lose interest in
myself Is there any chance of
that happening

MURRAY
None Better men have tried

“Widespread looting by men in plastic sheets” “I’ve seen at
least two more billowing clouds”

Murray looks around making sure they’re not being watched

MURRAY
Here take this I have another
one at home In the drawer under
my hotplate

Murray removes a dark object from the pocket of his jacket

MURRAY
Heft it around Get the feel
It’s loaded

He places the small gun in Jack’s palm

MURRAY
It’s an itty bitty thing but it
shoots real bullets It’s a 25-
caliber Zumwalt automatic German-
made Up your alley

JACK
I don’t want it

MURRAY
(sad wisdom)
What we are reluctant to touch
often is the very fabric of our
salvation

JACK
What do I do with it

Murray walks into the half-light of a flickering flame coming
from a nearby drum For a moment his face looks sinister

MURRAY

I believe Jack there are two
kinds of people in the world
Killers and diers Most of us are
diers We don’t have the
dispositions the rage or whatever
it takes to be a killer But think
how exciting it is in theory to
kill a person If he dies you
cannot To kill him is to gain
life-credit Who knows maybe
violence is a form of rebirth

(pause)
And maybe you can kill death

Jack pockets the gun A shadow puppet show plays for
children on a sheet Two musicians sing and play a song
“The Cloud is Coming” It plays over the following

INT BARRACKS

WIDE of the room We slowly move in to find Babette walking
back to her camp Wilder Steffie and Denise sleep on their
cots Heinrich finished with his lecture is making
notations on a road map

The larger flood lights start to go out The individual
camps lit by the kerosene lamps Babette sits down as we
come in closer all the way to her hand which she opens
revealing a white pill

She places it in her mouth BLACK

DENISE (VO)
Jack

CLOSE Jack opens his eyes A hand presses down on his
chest He gasps His eyes widening to reveal

DENISE
Jack wake up

Denise pounds on his arms and shoulders The overhead lights
are bright Sound is muffled

DENISE
We have to leave

Denise starts battering her mom now to wake her Sound
returns Sirens from outside A voice shouting instructions
through a bullhorn Car horns and a clanging bell somewhere

BABETTE
Five more minutes

DENISE
No more minutes

Babette is hoisted by her daughters who start to pack

packing Wilder is eating a cookie

She just likes to hear herself
talk

EXT CAMP SITE MORNING

A woman with an armband hands out gauzy white surgical masks
that cover the nose and the mouth She counts out six and
hands them to Jack and Babette who run by with their family

A scene of panoramic disorder Cars bleat trying to escape
Cars trapped in mud cars stalled cars crawling along the
one-lane escape route

A car screeches nearly hitting a running man The man
freezes with his hands braced on the hood The car behind it
tries to stop but rear-ends the first car now hurtling it
into the man who flips up into the air

The Gladneys run wearing their masks Babette looks up at
the sky A doll bounces out of Steffie’s open backpack

Cars careen into the woods looking for shortcuts Cars
hemmed in by trees boulders other cars Sirens call and
fade horns blare in desperation

People running Tents wind-blown into trees families
abandoning their vehicles and heading on foot for the
parkway Incoherent cries

Babette and the kids arrive at the station wagon

DENISE
Steffie lost her bunny

They call for Jack Jack nearly hit by a car approaches

BABETTE
Get Steffie’s bunny

Jack confused looks around and then sees the stuffed animal
lying amidst the fleeing evacuees He tosses Babette the
keys and runs back in the opposite direction against the
tide of people A man clips Jack’s shoulder Jack falls
down Feet trampling past his head The doll lies a few
feet away He reaches for it A hand reaches down and picks
it up just before Jack can grab it

Jack stands The man also masked hands the doll to Jack
CLOSE on the hand the long fingers the thin red scar

JACK
Thank you

The man bows strangely winks then turns and disappears into
the throng Jack turns back His family shouts and waves
from the station wagon across the lawn Jack runs

Jack arrives and unlocks the doors As his family dives in

he watches a group of men proceeding calmly to a Land Rover

They have lean frames short haircuts and boxy heads Their
bumper sticker reads GUN CONTROL IS MIND CONTROL They rev

up their vehicle

Jack quickly gets inside and starts the engine The Land
Rover drives straight into dense underbrush away from the
dirt road and away from all the other cars attempting
shortcuts

Jack follows in their wagon jouncing badly in the brush
dangling up inclines over hidden stones He glances up
searching the sky for clues

BABETTE
Where are you going

DENISESTEFFIE
JackThis isn’t a road

JACK
I have a feeling this Land Rover
knows how to stay alive

The tail lights of the Land Rover get further ahead until
they disappear out of sight

HEINRICH
Headlights at four o’clock

Jack clocks another set of faraway lights and heads in that
direction

JACK
On it

The car heels like a toboggan

DENISE
The lights aren’t getting any
closer

Babette turns on the radio It’s fuzzy

RADIO VOICE
the evacuees are to head in the
direction of Iron City

Horns blow from somewhere And then rotors Jack looks up
at the sky poking between the trees

DENISE
Now they’re over there

Lights appear in an entirely different direction Jack turns
now toward these shining yellow spots

He hits the accelerator jerks the wheel and arm-wrestles the
car through a thicket of white pine--heading in the direction
of lights

The car barrels through brush and branches bouncing up and
down Steffie turns and looks out the back window The
Rover is driving away in the opposite direction

STEFFIE
They’re behind us now

Jack hits the brakes Jack backs up

DENISE
(to Steffie)
Do it do it

Steffie barks convincingly like a dog

DENISE
(impressed)
That is good

HEINRICH
(pointing)
Fourteen-hundred o’clock

Jack jerks the wagon down another path They bounce forward
car sinking slightly Water spraying the windows

STEFFIE
We’re in the water Dad

JACK
I realize that now

Jack struggles to get the car over to the opposite bank of
the creek Rain falls thickly through the high beams
Exhaust billows through the pipes as the vehicle sinks

HEINRICH
Dad turn off the engine

Jack does

STEFFIE
Do sheep have lashes

BABETTE
Ask your father

STEFFIE
Dad do sheep have lashes

JACK
Doesn’t anyone want to pay
attention to what is actually
happening

BABETTE
Your Dad wants credit for fording
the creek

JACK
I don’t want credit Forget it go
back to your conversation

STEFFIE
Do sheep have lashes

HEINRICH
Were going sideways

They all look around and discover this is true Babette
turns to Jack

WIDE The car drifting down the creek
Back inside the car On their faces Drifting

DENISE
What if there was a waterfall

STEFFIE
Dad is there a waterfall

Jack tries steering the car like a boat Everyone is
screaming now For a moment the creek seems to get more
shallow and a wheel touches down on the rocky ground beneath

HEINRICH
Turn it back on

Jack quickly turns the key The car starts

Floor it

Jack hits the gas The car sputters and lurches forward and
skids through the water swinging wildly left and right as it
reaches land and climbs the opposite bank

Jack twists the car through more brush up onto an incline
which angles the vehicle’s nose upward In an instant he
revs it sending the car sailing momentarily through the air
blasting through branches--

Everyone screams

--and into an open field They land on the grass with
several bounces

WILDER
Again

The screams subside and everyone goes silent Up ahead is a
corn field

CUT TO Cars sit in bumper to bumper traffic on a winding
road A family waits bored in their vehicle Suddenly the
Gladney’s station wagon breaks out of the corn and merges
into the line

(waving to the friendly
family that lets him in)
Thank you

pale green eyes above her mask watching She passes a

as residents are now being asked to
relocate to Iron City where local
businesses have opened their doors
to shelter evacuees

A group of kids including Heinrich and Denise practice
karate moves The Gladneys and about forty other families
are in the abandoned studio Besides Steffie a few people
still wear their masks

(shouts through his hands)
No one is allowed to leave the
building If somebody comes up to
me and says can I leave I am just
going to say the same thing I am
saying now No one is allowed to
leave the building

Jack and other volunteers set up air mattresses and cots
some food and coffee We overhear (as before at the Boy
Scout camp) more rumors

Jack finds Babette who gazes solemnly out the window He
takes a styrofoam cup of a coffee and a wrapped Twinkie over
to her

JACK
How is Babette

She takes the coffee and raises it to her lips but doesn’t
drink Her eyes remained fixed on the streaked window

BABETTE
I don’t like the latest rumor

JACK
Tell me

BABETTE
They’re lowering in technicians
from army helicopters to plant
microorganisms in the core of the
toxic cloud

JACK
What don’t you like about it

BABETTE
I don’t know it’s like the greater
the scientific advance the more
scared I get

Jack looks up at the sky

MAN WITH TV (0S)
There’s nothing on network

A middle-aged man wearing a fur-lined cap with lowered flaps
and carrying a tiny TV set walks slowly through the studio

MAN WITH TV
Not a word not a picture On the
Glassboro channel we rate fifty-two
words by actual count No film
footage no live report Does this
thing happen so often that nobody
cares

Murmurs of ascent from the crowd

MAN WITH TV
We were scared to death

SOMEONE ELSE
We still are

MAN WITH TV
We left our homes drove through a
rainstorm we saw that deadly
specter That death ship that
sailed across the sky Are they
telling us it was insignificant
(MORE )

MAN WITH TV (CONT’D)
Do they think this is just
television Don’t they know it’s
real Shouldn’t the streets be
crawling with cameras and
reporters Shouldn’t we be yelling
out the window at them “Leave us
alone we’ve been through enough
already” Haven’t we earned the
right to despise their idiot
questions Look at us in this
place We are quarantined We are
like lepers in medieval times
Everything we love and worked for
is under serious threat Even if
there hasn’t been great loss of
life don’t we deserve attention
for our suffering our terror
Isn’t fear news

The group bursts into applause Babette nods her head
solemnly moved by the speech The man turns one more time
displaying the TV to the audience As he completes his turn
he comes face to face with Jack who claps

We see Jack reflected in the TV A change comes across the
man’s face

MAN WITH TV
(afraid)
I saw this before

JACK
Saw what before

MAN WITH TV
You were standing there I was
standing here Your features
incredibly sharp and clear It all
happened before Steam hissing in
the pipes Tiny little hairs
standing out in your pores That
identical look on your face

JACK
What look

INT SUPERMARKET BLACKSMITH DAY

ANNOUNCEMENT
Welcome back shoppers

Part III DYLARAMA

Jack pushes the cart Murray ambling next to him a basket of

generic goods around his arm

MURRAY
It’s comforting to know the
supermarket hasn’t changed since
the toxic event

A line waits as a bloodstained man pounds at strips of meat
and another pulls a few loaves of bread from an oven

MURRAY
In fact the supermarket has only
gotten better Between the
unpackaged meat and fresh bread
It’s like a Persian bazaar
(nods to himself)

Everything is fine and will
continue to be fine as long as the
supermarket doesn’t slip

A cleaver cuts into a rib A speck of blood hits the face

the woman waiting

MURRAY
Do you know the Tibetans believe
there is a transitional state
between death and rebirth That’s
what I think when I come here The
supermarket is a waiting place
It recharges us spiritually it’s a
gateway

And now we rise up and see the market in all its glory

MURRAY
Look how bright Look how full of
psychic data Waves and radiation
All the letters and numbers are
here all the colors of the
spectrum all the voices and
sounds all the code words and
ceremonial phrases We just have
to know how to decipher it

MURRAY
(and then)
How is that lovely woman of yours

JACK
She’s been different somehow since
the event

MURRAY
Weve suffered a collective trauma

JACK
She wears her sweatsuit all the
time she stares out of windows and
cries for no reason I don’t know
how to help her

JACK MURRAY
And I’ve been distracted And the kids
myself preparing for the
Hitler conference and

JACK
Back in school Steffie no longer
wears her protective mask

MURRAY
(pointedly)
And you
JACK

Ive got another doctor’s
appointment tomorrow

MURRAY
What does he say about your status
as a doomed man

JACK
I haven’t told him And since he
hasn’t found anything wrong I’m
not going to bring it up

MURRAY
I lie to doctors all the time

JACK
So do I But why

MURRAY
You know the Elvis struggle you
helped me with It turns out
tragically I would have won
anyway

JACK
What happened

MURRAY
Cotsakis my rival is no longer in
the land of the living

JACK MURRAY
He’s-- Dead Lost in the surf off
Malibu During term break
I found out an hour ago and
came right here
MURRAY
I’m sorry to tell you
(whispers so others can
hear)
Particularly because of your
condition
JACK
Poor Cotsakis lost in the surf
That enormous man
MURRAY JACK
He was big all right Enormously so
JACK
He must have weighed three hundred
pounds
MURRAY
Oh easily
JACK
Dead A big man like that
MURRAY
(picking up a Tabloid
magazine)

It’s better not knowing them when
they die But it’s better them
than us

JACK
To be so enormous Then to die I
can picture him so clearly

MURRAY
Maybe once we stop denying death
we can proceed calmly to die We
simply walk toward the sliding
doors

Jacks face is suddenly emotional Sounds begin to isolate
themselves

The drone of maintenance systems the rustle of newsprint
the whispers of elderly women The beeping of the
holographic scanners at check-out And the sad shuffle of
everyone’s steps

Finally we focus on the airy movement of the automatic doors
opening and closing like abrupt breaths People check out
and exit into the white light of the parking lot Amidst the
exiting bodies a narrow blurry figure blown out by the
sun enters the store He comes toward Jack taking a cart
as he proceeds

JACK
What if death is nothing but sound
You hear it forever Sound all
around

MURRAY
Uniform white

Jacks cart rams into another with a clank The scarred hand
clutches the handle of his cart Jack looks up but the man
has turned only his back visible as he disappears down
another aisle

MURRAY
It’s strange in a way isn’t it
That we can picture the dead

CUT TO Malibu horizon A big hairy man rides a giant wave
on a surfboard

DOCTOR LU (VO)
(cheerful)
Why so many checkups Mr Gladney
In the past you were always afraid
to know if anything was wrong

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE DAY
The whizzing sound of a dot-matrix printer Jack dresses
across from Doctor Lu 50’s who unwraps and looks at the

accordian print-out

JACK
I’m still afraid

Doctor Lu smiles broadly waiting for a punchline that
doesn’t come
DOCTOR LU
Well I’m glad you’re finally
taking your status as patient
seriously

JACK
My status

DOCTOR LU
Yes Once people leave the
doctor’s office they tend to forget
that they are patients Buta
doctor doesn’t cease being a doctor
at close of day Neither should
patient I don’t think I like your
potassium very much at all

JACK
(concerned)
What’s that mean

DOCTOR LU
There isn’t time to explain We
have true elevation and false
elevation That’s all you need to
know

He stands and heads toward the door indicating the
appointment is ending

JACK
Exactly how elevated is my
potassium

DOCTOR LU
It’s gone through the roof
evidently

JACK

Could this potassium be an
indication of some condition just
beginning to manifest itself some
condition caused perhaps by an
ingestion an exposure an
involuntary spillage-intake some
substance say in the air or rain

DOCTOR LU
(pointedly)
Have you come in contact with such
a substance Were you exposed to
that cloud

JACK
Why do the numbers show some sign
of possible exposure

DOCTOR LU
If you haven’t been exposed then
they couldn’t very well show a
sign could they

JACK
Then we agree
DOCTOR LU
And you would have no reason to lie

to me

Jack says nothing The doctor looks at Jack carefully Then
he makes a note on the chart

DOCTOR LU

I’m going to send you to Glassboro
for further tests They have a
brand new facility called Autumn
Harvest Farms Have you heard of
it

(Jack shakes his head)
They have gleaming new equipment
It gleams absolutely Tell them
to send you back to me with sealed
results Together as doctor and
patient we can do things that
neither of us could do separately

Jack nods and passes the doctor at the doorway

JACK
Doctor Lu have you heard of Dylar
DOCTOR LU
Is that an island in the Persian
Gulf
JACK
No it’s a medi--
DOCTOR LU JACK
One of those oil terminals --it’s notit’s something
crucial to the survival of that comes in a little white

Never heard of it

EXT GLADNEY’S HOME

We move up to an upper window of the house Babette stares
out from the bedroom She sobs

INT AUTUMN HARVEST FARMS
Jack moves slowly into a giant MRI machine
INT BEDROOM

Babette wears a loose gray sweatsuit Her hair piled on top
of her head She sobs at the window A radiator rattles
We STAY with her as she turns and enters the bathroom She
crouches down and lifts up the radiator cover She stashes
something underneath and then replaces the cover

She walks through the hallway crying

RADIO VOICE
Life is slowly but surely returning
to normal here in Blacksmith and
the surrounding areas I’m told
German shepherds have sniffed out
only a very low level of toxic
material on the edge of town But
there is no more danger posed to
humans or animals The last of the
emergency personnel are packing up
and taking the dogs with them

She picks up clothes left in the hallway toys She enters
the laundry room takes wet clothes out of the washer and
tosses them in the dryer

Inside the dryer The jeans flop around The sound of the
studs hitting the metal sides

We pick up Babette walking and begin to HEAR Heinrich from
downstairs

HEINRICH (0S)

The real issue is the kind of
radiation that surrounds us every
day Your radio your TV your
microwave oven the power lines
outside the door Forget clouds
It’s the electrical and magnetic
fields

Babette comes down the stairs to the kitchen

STEFFIE
Is Wilder talking less now

HEINRICH
If they released the true findings
there’d be billions of dollars in
law suits

JACK
That’s a little extreme isn’t it

HEINRICH
What’s extreme what I said or what
would happen

We see the family now setting the table for dinner Jack
looks over at Babette

STEFFIE
Why are mountains upstate

DENISE
Mountains are always upstate

STEFFIE
Say more

DENISE
This way the snow melts as planned
in the spring and flows downhill to
the reservoirs near the cities
which are kept in the lower end of
the state for exactly this reason

JACK
(to Heinrich)
Is that true

HEINRICH
(to Jack)
What do you think

JACK
I honestly don’t know

BABETTE
Kids listen to me Hold hands
when you cross the street OK Be
careful around swimming pools If
you think someone is a kidnapper
they probably are

The kids look back at her blankly
JACK

(to Babette)
Where are you going

BABETTE
They gave me a new class at the
church
JACK

times a week Where is the
uniqueness in this

DENISE
Jack can you help me with my
homework after dinner

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Denise leads Jack their feet making soft padding sounds on
the carpet

DENISE
The homework was a canard I want
to show you something

INT MASTER BATHROOM LATER

Denise kneels down and lifts the radiator cover and reaches
underneath

Taped to the bottom of the radiator cover is a pill bottle
Jack crouches down next to her
TV VOICE
They’re not booing they’re saying

Bruce

CLOSE on the amber bottle Through the crinkled transparent
tape the word Dylar

JACK
(simply)
Dylar

They look at one another Jack removes the bottle and opens
it into his palm 4 pills remain

DENISE
There are four left Take one for
proof We need physical evidence

Jack takes one of the pills and puts it in his pocket He
slides the remaining three pills back in the container tapes
it back and then carefully replaces the radiator cover

TV VOICE
Bruce Bruce Bruce
DENISE
We say nothing to Baba
JACK
All right
DENISE

She’1ll only say she doesn’t
remember why she put it there

JACK
I’1l go to the drug store first
thing in the morning and ask the
pharmacist about Dylar

DENISE
I already did that

JACK DENISE
When Around Christmas I went to
three drugstores--

JACK

What did they say
DENISE

Never heard of it It’s not on any

list

JACK DENISE
Unlisted We have to call her doctor

JACK

I’11 call him tomorrow

DENISE
Call him now This is serious
Jack Something is wrong with her

JACK
(convinced)
I’11 call him now 1I’11 call him
at home
DENISE
(ruthless)

Surprise him

JACK
(getting excited about the
plan)
If I get him at home he won’t be
screened by a receptionist

DENISE
Call him at home Wake him up
Trick him into telling us what we
want to know

JACK
Ill call him at home Wake him
up Trick him into telling us what
we want to know

DOCTORS VOICE
Hello

INT KITCHEN

Jack a phone book open on the counter talks on the wall
phone Denise huddles nearby making sure no one is coming

JACK
Doctor Hookstratten this is Jack
Gladney you treat my wife
Babette

DOCTORS VOICE
OK

JACK
I’m sorry to call you at home but
I’m concerned about Babette And
I’m pretty sure the medication you
prescribed is causing the problem

DOCTORS VOICE
What problem

JACK
Memory lapse

He winks at Denise

DOCTORS VOICE
You would call a doctor at home to
talk about memory lapse If
everyone with memory lapse called a
doctor at home what would we have
The ripple effect would be
tremendous

JACK
They are frequent The lapses

Denise is pouring them both glasses of milk She hands one
to Jack

DOCTORS VOICE
Frequent You would call a doctor
in his home after ten o’clock at
night You would say to him
“Memory lapse” Why not tell me
she has gas Call me at home for
gas

DENISE
(whispers )
Frequent AND prolonged

JACK DOCTOR’S VOICE
Frequent and prolonged What medication
doctor It has to be the
medication
JACKDENISE

DylarDylar

DOCTOR’S VOICE
Never heard of it

JACK
A small white tablet

DENISE
(whispers )
Comes in an amber bottle

JACK DOCTOR’S VOICE
Comes in an amber-- You would describe a tablet
as small and white and expect
a doctor to respond at home
after ten at night Why not
tell me it is round This is
crucial to our case

JACK
It’s an unlisted drug

DOCTORS VOICE
I never saw it I certainly never
prescribed it for your wife

DENISE JACK
Tell him I went to three OK thank you doctor sorry
pharma-- to have bothered you at home
He hangs up
JACK

I’m never in control of what I say
to doctors

They look at each other grimly

JACK
I’ll take the tablet and have it
analyzed by someone in the
chemistry department at the school
(pause)
Unless you’ve already done that
too

Denise shakes her head slowly

CUT TO Close on the white tablet held delicately between two
narrow fingers

INT CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT COLLEGE-ON-THE HILL DAY
It’s rotated a couple of times

WINNIE (0S)
It’s not a tablet in the old sense

On Winnie Richards She’s tall and gawky with bright and
excited eyes (We met her previously in the cafeteria) She
lopes around the room rapidly circling her cluttered desk
which includes a small open chocolate milk carton Jack
tries to follow

WINNIE
I’ve never seen anything quite like
it

JACK

What can you tell me about it Try
not to be too brilliant I haven’t
eaten lunch yet

She blushes

WINNIE
The medication in Dylar is encased
in a polymer membrane Water from
your gastrointestinal tract seeps
through the membrane at a carefully
controlled rate

JACK
What does the water do

WINNIE
It dissolves the medication encased
in the membrane The medicine then
passes out of the polymer tablet
through a single small hole

JACK
It took me a while to spot the
hole

WINNIE

That’s because it’s laser-drilled
It’s not only tiny but stunningly
precise in its dimensions

JACK
(shakes his head)
Lasers polymers

Winnie exits the room folders pressed to her chest Jack
follows her down the hall

WINNIE
I’m not an expert in any of this
Jack but I can tell you it’s a
wonderful little system

JACK
What’s the point of all this
precision

WINNIE
The drug is delivered at specified
rates for extended periods This
system is efficient

JACK
I’m impressed I’m even dazzled
Now tell me what the medication is
designed to do What is Dylar

She enters another small room full of bottled brains The
table is fitted with a sink and small note pads and lab
instruments She turns around dramatically

WINNIE
I don’t know

JACK
Of course you know You’re
brilliant Everyone says so

WINNIE
What else can they say I do
neurochemistry No one knows what
that is

She unlocks a back door to the room and opens it onto the
campus

WINNIE
Jack all I can tell you for
certain is that the substance
contained in Dylar is some kind of
psychopharmaceutical It’s
probably designed to interact with
a distant part of the human cortex

Jack starts to follow but she indicates for him to stay

WINNIE
I wish I knew more But I can tell
you this It’s not on the market

JACK
I found it in an ordinary
prescription vial

WINNIE
I don’t care where you found it
This is unknown

INT GLADNEYS HOME NIGHT

Babette enters She hangs up her coat drops the car keys in
a dish A light clicks on in the corner of the living room
She startles

Jack sits in arm chair illuminated dramatically by the floor
lamp The light has come on too bright so Jack has to click
the switch a couple of times more for it to dim down

JACK
It’s time for a major dialogue You
know it I know it

Babette says nothing

JACK
We found the Dylar

BABETTE
What Dylar

JACK
Come on Baba It was taped to the
radiator cover

BABETTE
Why would I tape something to the
radiator cover

JACK
That’s exactly what Denise
predicted you would say

BABETTE
She’s usually right

She heads toward the stairs Jack gets out of the chair and
follows

JACK
You’1l tell me all about Dylar If
not for my sake then for your
little girl’s She’s been worried
- worried sick Besides you have
no more room to maneuver We’ve
backed you against the wall

Babette turns around stares at Jack

JACK
I had one of the tablets analyzed
by an expert Dylar is almost as
ingenious as the microorganisms
that ate the billowing cloud

She continues up the stairs and down the upstairs hallway
Jack following

JACK
We know something else something
crucially damaging to your case
We know Dylar is not available to
the general public As you well
know I don’t have the temperament
to hound people But Denise is a
different kind of person If you
don’t tell me what I want to know
I’1l unleash your little girl

(MORE)

JACK (CONTD)

She’1l come at you with everything
she has She’ll hammer you right
into the ground You know I’m
right Babette

They’ve arrived in their bedroom Babette removes her watch
and bracelets and places them on the bureau She takes her
hair down and puts the bungie next to her bed She
disappears into the closet We hear her changing her
clothes Jack waits Finally

BABETTE (0S)
(in a small but decisive
voice)

Just let me tell it in my own way

JACK
Take your time We’ve got all day
Ill be right here for as long as
it takes

Babette reappears in a baggy pink sweatshirt and underwear

BABETTE
I don’t know exactly when it
started Maybe a year and a half
ago I thought I was going through
a phase some kind of watermark
period in my life

JACK BABETTE
Landmark Or watershed A kind of settling-in-period
I thought Middle age
Something like that The
condition would go away and
Id forget all about it But
it didn’t go away

JACK
What condition

BABETTE
Never mind that for now

JACK
I’ve never seen you like this
This is the whole point of Babette
She’s a joyous person She doesn’t
succumb to gloom or self-pity

BABETTE
Let me tell it Jack
JACK
All right

BABETTE
You know how I am I think
everything is correctable Given
the right attitude a person can
change a harmful condition by
reducing it to its simplest parts
So when I realized this condition
was not going away I set out to
reduce it to its parts I went to
libraries and bookstores watched
cable TV made lists and diagrams
talked to a holy Sikh man in Iron
City and even studied the occult
hiding the books in the attic so
you and Denise wouldn’t find them
and wonder what was going on

JACK
All this without my knowing The
whole point of Babette is that she
speaks to me she reveals and
confides

BABETTE
This is not a story about your
disappointment at my silence The
theme of this story is my pain and
my attempts to end it

JACK
OK

BABETTE
I did all this research but I was
getting nowhere The condition
hung over my life Then one day at
the supermarket I was reading a
tabloid on line There was an ad
Never mind exactly what it said
Volunteers wanted for secret
research I answered the ad and
was interviewed by a small firm
doing research in psychobiology
Let’s call the company Gray
Research although that’s not the
true name lLet’s call my contact
Mr Gray Mr Gray is a composite
I was eventually in touch with
three or four or more people at the
firm

JACK
One of those long low pale brick
buildings with electrified fencing
and low-profile shrubbery

BABETTE

I never saw their headquarters
Never mind why The point is I
took test after test Emotional
psychological motor response
brain activity Mr Gray said
there were three finalists and I
was one of them

JACK
Finalists for what

BABETTE
We were to be test subjects in the
development of a super experimental
and top-secret drug Code-name

Dylar
JACK
(dryly)
Aha
BABETTE

He’d found a Dylar receptor in the
human brain and was putting the
finishing touches on the tablet
itself I felt hopeful for the
first time in so long But there
were many dangers in running tests
on humans Among other things it
could cause death
(Jack raises his eyebrows)
Or I could live but my brain could
die I could not distinguish words
from things so that if someone
said falling plane I would fall
to the floor and take cover
(sadly)
In the end it just made me forget
things

JACK
And they let you go ahead anyway a
human test animal

Babette gets into bed pulling up the covers

BABETTE
No they didn’t They finally said
it was all too risky - legally
ethically and so forth

JACK BABETTE

Well that’s good-- No I refused to accept
this I want you to try to
understand what happened
next If I’m going to tell
you the story at all I have
to include this aspect of it
this grubby little corner of
the human heart You say
Babette reveals and confides

JACK
This is the point of Babette

BABETTE
Good I will reveal and confide
But you don’t want to know what
happened You think you do but
you don’t

Jack hesitates

BABETTE
Mr Gray and I made a private
arrangement We would conduct the
experiments on our own I would be
cured of my condition he would be
acclaimed for a wonderful medical

breakthrough
JACK
OK
BABETTE

It involved an indiscretion This
was the only way I could get Mr
Gray to let me use the drug It
was my last resort my last hope
First I’d offered him my mind Now
I offered my body

Jack feels a sensation of warmth creeping up his back and
radiating outward across his shoulders Babette looks away
Jack studies her features Finally

JACK
How do you offer your body to a
composite of three or more people
This is a compound person

(MORE )
Jack--

JACK (CONT’D)
Let’s concentrate on the genitals
How many sets are we talking about

BABETTE
Just one person’s Jack A key
person the project manager

JACK
So we are no longer referring to
the Mr Gray who is a composite

BABETTE
He is now one person We went to a
grubby little motel room Never
mind where or when It had the TV
up near the ceiling This is all I
remember I was so ashamed I wore
a ski mask to cover my face

JACK
(struggling with his
anger)
You call this an indiscretion You
traded sex for pills

BABETTE JACK
You walked barefoot on the
fire retardant carpet Mr
Gray put the car rental keys
on the dresser and then he
entered you

BABETTE
Don’t use that term You know how
I feel about that word

JACK
(furious)
He effected what is called entry
In other words he inserted himself
inside you

BABETTE
No one was inside anyone That is
stupid usage I did what I had to
do I was remote I was operating
outside of myself It was a
capitalist transaction You
cherish your wife who tells you
everything I am doing my best to
be that person

Jack paces trying to harness all his different emotions A
sadness shows in her eyes

JACK
I’m only trying to understand How
many times did you go to this
motel

BABETTE
More or less on a continuing basis
for some months That was the
agreement

Jack watches her carefully

JACK
Diddid you enjoy having sex with
him

BABETTE

I only remember the TV up near the
ceiling aimed down at us

The white light shining from the streetlight outside flickers
for a moment through the window Babette begins to cry
softly Jack goes into the bathroom and splashes water on
his face The only towel available is small and pink with a
tic-tac-toe design

JACK
Did he have a sense of humor I
know women appreciate men who can
joke about sex I can’t
unfortunately and after this I
don’t think there’s much chance
Ill be able to learn

BABETTE
It’s better if you know him as Mr
Gray That’s all He’s not tall
short young or old He doesn’t
laugh or cry It’s for your own
good

He exits the bathroom through the other door into the
hallway He hesitates

Babette cries softly Jack reenters the bedroom

JACK
You have to tell me who he is I
need to know

BABETTE
No How do I know you won’t kill
him

JACK
Because I’m not a killer

BABETTE
Youre a man Jack We all know
about men and their insane jealous
rage This is something men are
very good at When people are good
at something it’s only natural that
they look for a chance to do it

JACK
I’m not good at that I twirl
garbage bags and twist-tie them I
get startled by joggers
(pause)
Is this still going on

BABETTE
No

JACK
Why not

BABETTE

Because the drug didn’t work
At least on me

Babette starts to cry again Jack shakes his head turns
aimlessly again

JACK
Maybe I should go Get a hotel
room I don’t know I don’t know

Babette continues to weep She shakes Jack regards her
then slowly moves to the bed His anger clouded with
sympathy he places a hand on her heaving back

His eyes are full of tears She turns around looks at him
and embraces him He doesn’t respond And then she’s
kissing him Finally he kisses her back and succumbs They
grab each other with desperation Their bodies clenched in
an embrace of love grief tenderness sex and struggle
Babette starts to unbutton Jack’s shirt and suddenly he
withdraws

He stands and starts buttoning up his shirt

JACK
Youve taken me this far put me
through this much I have to know
What’s the condition

Babette’s face is sorrowful and pale her eyes showing a
helpless desolation

BABETTE
I’m afraid to die I’m afraid of
my death

JACK

You You’re still young you run
up and down the stadium steps
It’s not a reasonable fear

BABETTE
I can’t believe we’re all marching
toward non-existence All of us
It haunts me Jack and it won’t go
away

Jack moves around the room

JACK
Baba everyone fears death
There’s no one who has lived past
the age of seven who hasn’t worried
about dying

BABETTE
But Mr Gray said I was extra
sensitive to it that I fear it
right up front That’s why he was
eager to use me

JACK
Baba I am the one in this family
who is obsessed by death I have
always been the one

BABETTE
What do you want me to say Your
fear is older and wiser than mine

JACK
(hesitates)
Yes

BABETTE
I love you I just fear death more
than I love you

She raises the comforter over her head
BABETTE

(under the blanket)
And I really really love you

Jack stares at the hilly terrain

JACK
There’s something I promised myself
I wouldn’t tell you

BABETTE
(through the covers)
Can it wait until morning

JACK
I’m tentatively scheduled to die
It won’t happen tomorrow or the
next day But it is in the works

Babette slowly emerges from the covers

JACK
So we are no longer talking about
fear and floating terror This is
the hard and heavy thing the fact
itself

Jack starts telling her what happened Other sounds take
over The hum of the thermostat The running of the water
in the walls The clang of the radiator The movement of
the dryer All blurring into white noise

We HOLD on Babette’s tear streaked face DISSOLVE TO

INT COLLEGE CAFTERIA

Alfonse Grappa Lasher at the table with Murray and Jack
Winnie sitting behind them as before at an adjacent table

ALFONSE
Imagining yourself dead is one of
the cheapest sleaziest most
satisfying forms of childish self-

pity

GRAPPA
How much pleasure did you take as a
kid in imagining yourself dead

LASHER
I still imagine my death Whenever
I’m upset about something I
imagine all my friends relatives
and colleagues gathered at my
casket They are very very sorry
they weren’t nicer to me while I
lived

We STAY on Jack’s face We hear the professors continue

WINNIE
Children are very good at self-pity
which must mean it’s natural and
important

ALFONSE
But there is something even more
childish and satisfying than self-
pity something that explains why I
try to see myself dead on a regular
basis

MURRAY
I feel I’m learning important
things every day here Death
disease afterlife outer space
It’s all much clearer here I can
think and see I bought this tie

GRAPPA
When you bite dead skin off your
thumb do you eat it or spit it

out
LASHER ALFONSE
Chew it briefly then propel It is a way of punishing
it swiftly from the end of people for thinking their own
the tongue lives are more important than

mine

MURRAY
Thats what it all comes down to in
the end A person spends his life
saying good-bye to other people

ALFONSE
Yes but how does he say good-bye
to himself

DUNLOP’S VOICE
Show me your tongue

Jack sticks out his tongue
CUT TO Babette stares straight ahead She appears to be in
a motel room Blurry gray figures crawl over her picking at

her face

CUT TO Dunlop’s face saying something in German

CUT TO Babette reaches her hand up to her face The hand is
long bony and masculine with a long pink scar rising and
falling between the tendons and veins She tugs and pulls at
her skin Her fingers burrowing into her cheeks and chin
Gloom moves in around the gray-sheeted bed a circle slowly
closing swallowing up the room

Her face remains as darkness closes in Her long fingers dig
deeper into her face as she opens her mouth and whispers

BABETTE
Panasonic

She rips the skin off of her cheek

CUT TO Jack opens his eyes He’s sleeping on a pull-out
couch in the family den The TV is on silent a flickering
white light Jack blinks his eyes adjusting to the dim
light The Panasonic clock reads 347

INT BEDROOMMASTER BATHROOM

Babette sleeps alone in their bed Jack slips by quietly

Jack kneels down lifts up the radiator cover and sticks his
hand underneath The bottle of Dylar is gone

INT DENISES ROOM NIGHT
Denise wakes up Someone is in her room Her eyes adjust
Jack stands half in and half out of her closet rummaging

through things

DENISE
What are you doing

JACK
Don’t worry it’s only me

Something topples off a shelf in the closet with a thud

DENISE
I know who it is

He keeps searching

DENISE
I know what you’re looking for

JACK
What did you do with the bottle
There were three tablets left

DENISE
How do you know I took it

JACK
I know it you know it

The gas meter makes a particular noise

DENISE
If somebody wants to tell me what
Dylar really is maybe we’ll get
somewhere

JACK
Your mother no longer takes the
medication Whatever your reason
for holding the bottle it’s not
valid anymore

DENISE
Tell me what it does and I’1l give
it to you
Jack hesitates
JACK

OK
He moves out of the closet and sits on her bed

JACK

Ive had a recent scare I thought
something awful was about to
happen It turned out I was wrong
thank goodness But there are
lingering effects

(pause)
I need the Dylar

DENISE
What’s the problem

JACK
Isn’t it enough for you to know
that a problem exists

DENISE
I just don’t want to be tricked

JACK
There’s no question of tricking I
just need the medication
DENISE
You’1l give them to my mother who I
think stole my ski mask by the way
Is she a drug addict

JACK
You know that’s not true

DENISE
You two aren’t going to get
divorced are you

JACK
Why would you ask that

DENISE
Youre sleeping on the pull-out
It’s uncomfortable

JACK

(relenting)
We are talking about death I fear
it And the tablets probably don’t
work But maybe they will in me
And even if they don’t It
doesn’t matter what they are I’m
eager to be humored

DENISE
Isn’t that a little stupid
JACK
(nods )
This is what happens to desperate
people

(hesitates)
You remember you heard on the radio
that the billowing cloud caused
sweaty palms and then your palms
got sweaty didn’t they The power
of suggestion makes some people
sick and other people well If I
think it will help me it will help
me

DENISE
I threw the bottle away

JACK
No you didn’t Where

DENISE
I put it in the garbage compactor

Jack leaps up

JACK
When

DENISE
(getting upset)
A few days ago Compacted it

CUT TO The garage He empties the garbage cans

The compressed bulks sit there like an ironic modern
sculpture He takes the butt end of a rake and jabs at them
spreading the trash across the concrete floor

From ABOVE He picks through item by item Dots of shape
and color The colors recall a dark underbelly of the
supermarket

Jack begins carefully and then his search grows more
desperate The stench hits him He recoils

Individual items

A crayon drawing of a figure with full breasts and male
genitals A banana skin with a tampon in it Clotted masses
of hair soap ear swabs crushed roaches strands of frayed
dental floss ballpoint refills shredded undershorts with
lipstick markings

Jack pauses over these

No Dylar

Sweating matted with debris out of breath he slumps over
distraught His attention shifts A crushed torn newspaper
catches his eye He reaches for it It’s a supermarket
tabloid Jack opens it matting down the pages His fingers
picking up the gray newsprint His eyes scanning each page
We see bits of headlines the content of sensational articles
about aliens and strange births All reminiscent of what
Babette was reading in the barrack

CLOSE on an ad in the corner of the page

Afraid of Death

We move up to reveal Jack amidst the trash

CUT TO A ladder appears Then Jack’s face emerges He

reaches around a high shelf retrieving a Reebok shoebox
hidden high above buckets and pails

Inside is the automatic Zumwalt gun Jack removes the gun
He then retrieves three bullets from an old Folger’s coffee
can

What does it mean

JACK

Jack passes Murray and the other professors on his way to the

door

MURRAY
Jack I never knew there was
so much to say about Hitler’s
dog

MURRAY
Elvis loved dogs too Let’s
see there was Woodlawn and
Muffy Dee and Champagne--

GRAPPA
It was an automatic thing

EXT OVERPASSROADWAY MOTEL NIGHT

The low rumble of trucks on an overpass The car parked
under the bridge Inside the car Jack loads the gun His
eyes shut tightly his nerves rattling

He gets out of the car

A one-story building set against the roadway The motel has
nine or ten rooms The rain-soaked lot is empty

In the wide Jack walks toward the motel

An aluminum awning over the check-in door The drip of water
hitting the metal Jack peers into a dimly lit office which
looks empty On the door are little plastic letters arranged
in slots to spell out a message

NU MISH BOOT ZUP KO

We dolly with Jack as he makes his way along the wall
looking peripherally through windows

The sound of trucks rumbling overhead

In the next to last unit there is the scantest flicker of
light

Jack stands at the edge of the window He listens He
swivels his head to look into the room out of the corner of
his eye

A figure sits in a low armchair looking up at the flickering
light

Jack grips the doorknob
He turns it

It opens He slips into the dark of the room A low hum
The walls are a sad color of green the ceiling cracked His
feet shift on the grimy industrial carpet

A crackling sound as his foot comes down on a small white
pill

A TV floats in the air encased in a metal brace pointing
down at man sitting sprawled in the short-legged chair The
sound is off He wears a Hawaiian shirt and Budweiser baggy
shorts Torn stockings as socks His hair greasy his eyes
half-closed His long fingers wrap around the arm-wrest
The scar across his hand

The man speaks without taking his eyes off of the TV

MAN
Are you heartsick or soulsick

The door falls closed behind Jack with a click He
hesitates

JACK
I know you

MR GRAY
Yes I’ve been around I’m the
chick and the cheese I’m
thewhere was I

After a moment Mr Gray looks at Jack

MR GRAY
What do you want

JACK
I want some Dylar

MR GRAY
What do you want

JACK
I want to live

MR GRAY
But you’re dying

JACK
(voice cracks)
But I don’t want to

MR GRAY
Then we agree To enter a room is
to agree to a certain kind of
behavior It isn’t a street or a
parking lot for instance The
point of rooms is that they’re
inside

JACK
Good point

MR GRAY

There is an unwritten agreement
between the person who enters a
room and the person whose room has
been entered A room is inside
This is what people in rooms have
to agree on as differentiated from
lawns meadows fields orchards

JACK
That makes perfect sense

The hum of the room seems to shift tone

MR GRAY
To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
this is what you do

Jack nods Mr Gray reaches into his pocket and produces a
handful of white tablets which he tosses in the direction of
his mouth Some enter some fly past

MR GRAY
I wasn’t always as you see me now

JACK
That’s what I was thinking

MR GRAY
I was doing important work I
envied myself Death without fear
is an everyday thing You can live
with it

JACK
Youre saying there is no death as
we know it without the element of
fear Without fear people would
adjust to it accept it

MR GRAY
Dylar failed reluctantly

JACK
With everybody

MR GRAY
With all bodies But it will
definitely come Maybe now maybe
never

JACK
There will eventually be an
effective medication you’re
saying A remedy for fear

MR GRAY
Followed by a greater death More
effective product-wise

Mr Gray throws more pills in the direction of his open
mouth He sucks them like sweets

MR GRAY
Just between us chickens I eat
this stuff like candy

JACK
I was just thinking that

MR GRAY
How much do you want to buy

JACK
How much do I need

MR GRAY
Youre a big man Middle age
Does this describe your anguish I
see you as a person in a dark brown
jacket champagne colored pants
Tell me how correct I am

Silence There are cracked Dylar tablets all over the fire
retardant carpet Trod upon stomped Mr Gray lies down on
the bed

MR GRAY
I learned English watching American
TV I barely forget the times I
had in this room before I became
misplaced There was a woman in a
ski mask but her name escapes me
at the moment American sex let
me tell you this is how I learned
my English

Jack’s gaze lingers sadly at the TV The set has a walnut
veneer with silvery hardware The picture rolls badly

In the reflection he sees Babette sitting on the bed with Mr
Gray She slowly climbs on top of him her body dissolving
into his

Jack turns around to face Mr Gray He swallows his ears
clearing sound shifting in his head Jack becomes hyper-
conscious of every object every sound The buzz of a light
above the stove the dripping faucet in the sink how water
strikes the roof in elongated orbs splashing drams The
room tone seems to shriek momentarily and then hums White
noise everywhere Jack advances two steps toward the middle
of the room

BABETTE (VO)
I could not distinguish words from
things so that if someone said
“falling plane” I would fall to
the floor and take cover

JACK
Falling plane

Mr Gray flails on the bed

JACK
Plunging aircraft

Mr Gray kicks off his sandals folds himself over into the
recommended crash position head well forward hands clasped
behind his knees

Jack watches him slumped trembling He takes another step
toward the bed

MR GRAY
Why are you here white man

JACK
To buy

MR GRAY
You are very white you know that

JACK
It’s because I’m dying

MR GRAY
This stuff fix you up

JACK
I’1l still die

MR GRAY
But it won’t matter which comes to
the same thing

Jack advances into the area of flickering light out of the
shadows seeking to loom He puts his hand in his pocket
gripping the firearm Mr Gray watches the screen again

JACK
(hand in pocket)
Hailing bullets

Mr Gray hits the floor and begins to crawl toward the
bathroom looking back over his shoulder childlike showing
real terror Jack follows him into the toilet

JACK
(whispers )
Fusillade

Mr Gray tries to wriggle behind the bowl both arms over his
head his legs tight together Jack looms in the doorway
He raises the gun and points it at the trembling man

JACK
My name is Jack Gladney and I’m
here to kill you I’m a former
dier who is now a killer You know
my wife Babette She wore the ski
mask

Mr Gray puts his hands over his crotch and tries to fit
himself under the toilet tank behind the bowl Jack
swallows again

MR GRAY
She wore the ski mask so as not to
kiss my face which she said was un-
American I told her a room is
inside Do not enter a room not
agreeing to this

(MORE )

MR GRAY (CONTD)
This is the point as opposed to
emerging coastlines continental
plates

He climbs up onto the toilet seat He seems to be going to
the bathroom Jack lowers the gun unsure suddenly

MR GRAY
Or you can eat natural grains
vegetables eggs no fish no
fruit Or fruit vegetables animal
proteins no grains no milk

Sound all around

MR GRAY
Or lots of soybean milk for B-12
and lots of vegetables to regulate
insulin release but no meat no
fish no fruit There are endless
workable combinations

Mr Gray grabs more tablets from his pocket and hurls them
toward his open mouth He tears open his shirt pocket to
find more pills Jack raises the gun again

MR GRAY
Did you ever wonder why out of
thirty-two teeth these four cause
so much trouble I’11 be back with
the answer in a minute

Mr Gray flushes the toilet Jack fires the gun The sound
snowballs in the green tiled room

Blood squirts from Mr Gray’s midsection A delicate arc
Jack watches it in awe The flow diminishes to a trickle
spreading across the tile floor

Jack fires a second shot the jolt traveling up his arm The
bullet strikes Mr Gray just inside the right hipbone A red
stain appears on his shorts and shirt Mr Gray sits wedged
between the toilet bowl and wall one sandal missing eyes
totally white Blood seeping

The trucks rumble overhead Jack approaches the sitting
figure stepping around the blood He takes out a
handkerchief and wipes the weapon clean kneels down and
places it in Mr Gray’s hand cautiously removing the
handkerchief painstakingly wrapping Mr Gray’s bony fingers
one by one around the stock delicately working his index
finger through the trigger guard Mr Gray foams at the
mouth and his eyes drop out of his skull

Jack steps back to survey the scene Behind him Babette
enters the motel

BABETTE
(quietly)
Jack

Mr Gray’s eyes gleam briefly He raises his hand and pulls
the trigger shooting Jack

Jack reels hurt and stunned Blood covers his forearm and
hand He looks the bullet has made a shallow penetration in
his wrist

Jack turns around and sees Babette standing in the center of
the motel room

JACK
Baba

Suddenly red streams through her coat which falls over her
right leg

JACK
You’ve been shot

BABETTE
So have you

Blood drips from the tips of Jack’s fingers

JACK
I’m sorry

MR GRAY
(mumbles )
And this could represent the
leading edge of some warmer air

Jack looks at Mr Gray He’s alive His lap a puddle of
blood Snapped with a jolt into the moment Jack stumbles
over to Babette

JACK
It must have ricocheted off my
wrist

BABETTE

And hit my leg

Jack wrestles his belt off of his waist and manages with his
right hand and teeth to tie it firmly just above the bullet
hole in Babette’s leg While he does this

JACK
How did you know I’d be here

BABETTE
(shrugs )
Men are killers

Jack sucks on his wrist and spits out the blood and pulp
She grabs a pillow case shaking it off a pillow and ties it
around Jack’s wrist Jack looks back at Mr Gray

BABETTE
He needs help

JACK
Come on let’s get him out of here

BABETTE
We need help

EXT ROADWAY MOTEL NIGHT

The rain has stopped Jack kicks open the front door
Babette limping and Jack one good arm drag Mr Gray
behind them on a bedsheet blood striping the sheet and the
sidewalk Mr Gray’s gun hand drags along the pavement

BABETTE
Why did you give him a loaded gun

JACK
I was thinking I’d shot him three
times but it was only twice and my
plan was I don’t know I clearly
fucked that up

They reach the Gladney’s station wagon (which Babette parked
outside the motel)

JACK
I’1l come back and get Murray’s car
later

Mr Gray kicks free involuntarily his body flopping and
spinning fishlike He makes gasping noises short of
oxygen

BABETTE
He’s choking

Jack leans over him and clothes-pins Mr Gray’s nose using

his thumb and index finger in an attempt to give him mouth-to-
mouth Mr Gray’s eyes follow Jack down to his face It’s
awkward and intimate

Mr Gray’s mouth is awash in regurgitated Dylar foam half
chewed tablets Jack kneels over the wounded man exhaling
rhythmically into his mouth His knees in the wet and
littered street Babette watches sadly

Mr Gray starts to come around and take regular breaths
Jack removes his mouth but hovers just above his face
Their mouths almost touching

MR GRAY
Who shot me

JACK
Um1I

BABETTE

(jumping in)
You did You shot you

Jack looks at Babette grateful then back at Mr Gray and
nods

MR GRAY
Who shot you

BABETTE
You did The gun is in your hand
MR GRAY
What was the point I was trying to
make
BABETTE

You were out of control You
weren’t responsible

JACK
We forgive you

Who are you literally

JACK
We’re passersby Friends It
doesn’t matter

With much effort and many false starts Jack and Babette
wrap him in the sheet and get him into the back of their
station wagon Mr Gray stretches out moaning

INT STATION WAGON

Jack moaning drives one-handed through the empty streets
looking for a hospital Babette moaning in the passenger
seat Mr Gray moaning in the back The streets are empty
save for a milk truck coming from the other direction

They pass a three-story former Pentecostal church with a neon
cross over the entrance Jack hits the brakes screeches to
a halt and backs up onto the curb

Jack and Babette drag Mr Gray by the feet up a wheelchair
ramp Mr Gray holds one hand at his midsection to stanch

behind the smoked glass The door opens

We see a lot of that here

She turns back inside Jack and Babette drag Mr Gray across
the entranceway

INT CLINIC

There are waiting rooms screened cubicles doors marked X-
Ray Eye Test They follow the old nun into the grand space
Two orderlies appear great squat men with sumo physiques
They push two gurneys The nun irritated calls out
something else in German

Another nun comes racing pushing a shopping cart The
orderlies lift Jack and Babette onto each gurney The nun
barks something in German They lift Mr Gray and put him in
the cart

MR GRAY
Inflated-adjusted real income

More nuns arrive rustling ancient speaking German to each
other They carry transfusion equipment wheeled in trays of
glinting implements An orderly removes the gun from Mr
Gray’s hand He tosses it in a desk drawer that holds about
ten other hand guns and half a dozen knives

The three of them Jack and Babette in gurneys and Mr Gray
between them in the cart are pushed through the space Mr
Gray is then pulled away and the couple on the two gurneys is
pushed together

MR GRAY

other The original nun follows Jack and Babette into a

More nuns walk by heavy rosaries swinging from their belts
The image comforts Jack and Babette

He points to various objects in the room and says the name in
German The nun nods happily while she cleans and wraps
Babette’s leg in sterile pads Babette laughs

Two more nuns appear wizened and creaky The nun says
something to them They smile nod and look at Jack and
Babette addressing their bullet wounds They all count to
ten together recite colors items of clothing and parts of
the body in German

There’s a picture on the wall of Jack Kennedy holding hands
with Pope John XXIII in heaven Babette elicits a small
smile

BABETTE
What does the Church say about
heaven these days Is it still the
old heaven like that

The nun turns to glance at the picture

NUN
Do you think we are stupid

Jack is taken aback by the force of her reply

NUN
We are here to take care of sick
and injured Only this You would
talk about heaven you must find
another place

BABETTE
Then why do you have that picture
on the wall

She draws back her eyes filled with contemptuous pleasure

NUN
It is for others Not for us
JACK
You don’t believe in heaven A
nun
NUN

If you don’t why should I

JACK
If you did maybe we would

NUN
If I did you would not have to
Someone must appear to believe

BABETTE
Is death the end then Does
anything survive

NUN
Do you want to know what I believe
or what I pretend to believe

JACK
I don’t want to hear this This is
terrible

BABETTE
You’re a nun

JACK
Act like one

NUN
You would come in from the street
married dragging a body by the
foot and talk about angels that
live in the sky Get out from
here

She presses her face toward theirs and continues forcefully
in German

NUN

(in German)
Anyone who comes in here talking
about Angels is a numbskull Show
me an Angel Please I want to
see one Show me a saint Give me
one hair from the body a Saint It
is our task in the world to believe
in things no one else believes If
we abandon such beliefs the human
race would die out That is why we
are here A tiny minority If we
didn’t pretend to believe these
things the world would collapse
Hell is when no one believes

The words growing harsher wetter more guttural Her eyes
show a terrible delight in their incomprehension

Babette’s fingers find Jacks

NUN (CONTD)
We pray lighting candles asking
statues for good health and long
life But not for long You will
lose your believers

The nun stops her rant and taps her cane for emphasis then
walks away

NUN
(then in English)
So maybe you should try to believe
in each other then

The doctor comes in wearing his hearing aid

JACK
Herr Dokter Will he be alright

HERR DOKTER
Not for a while but he will
survive

Jack and Babette are now alone holding hands

BABETTE
I wish I hadn’t told you about my
condition

JACK
Why

She starts to cry

BABETTE
Then you wouldn’t have told me
youre going to die first The two
things I want most in the world are
for you to not die first and for
Wilder to stay the way he is
forever

JACK
Once I almost asked you to put on
legwarmers before we made love

something was wrong

humps Food or water

They move around the room making cereal toast drinking
orange juice talking over each other the familiar sounds of
a family in the morning

HEINRICH
It depends which kind you’re
talking about There are one hump
and two hump camels

DENISE HEINRICH
Are you saying a two-hump The important thing about
camel stores food in one hump camels is that camel meat is
and water in the other considered a delicacy

DENISE STEFFIE
I thought that was alligator Who introduced the camel to
meat America

HEINRICH

Are you sure you’re not talking
about llamas

Jack and Babette find each other across the table

As the family exits the car we pick up with them and follow
them

JACK (VO)
But out of some persistent sense of
large-scale ruin we keep inventing
hope
INT SUPERMARKET
The Gladney’s walk through the sliding doors
JACK (VO)
And this is where we wait

together

A shopping dance has developed throughout the store The
dance is exuberant

Joyous music accompanies them

The credits roll as the shoppers dance
