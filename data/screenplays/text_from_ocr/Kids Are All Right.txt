New York NY 10014
FADE UP ON

The humming stillness of an American suburb on a summer’s
day nannies push strollers joggers jog mailmen deliver
dogs are walked kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways

A slow moving camera tracks across block after block of
charming evenly spaced houses on wide shady streets Here
it seems reasonableness and order has prevailed against the
forces of entropy and chaos

This where progressive urbanites have flocked for space and a
more family-friendly lifestyle

CHYRON SHERMAN OAKS CA - JULY

It is on one of these quiet tree-lined streets that we pick
up two young athletic-looking boys riding bikes

LASER ALLGOOD long floppy hair covering moody eyes and
thoughts and his friend Clay bigger more aggressive

We follow the young men as they pull up to a more run-down
less gentrified house with a dead front lawn

INT CLAYS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

They walk inside The place is decorated in cheap dated
Levitz furniture A lack of female presence is palpable
INT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Clay and Laser enter the master bathroom Clay heads right
for the medicine cabinet opens it up They rummage through
the bottles Clay opens a bottle of Percocet and hands one

to Laser

LASER
What do these do

Clay hits Laser in the arm hard

LASER (CONTD)
Ow

CLAY
Make you not feel that

LASER
(trying to sound tough)
Fuck you dude
CLAY
Dude quit being a pussy

Clay pops a pill Hands one to Laser

INT CLAYS HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER

Laser and Clay wrestle sloppily on the floor while Clay’s DAD
watches a baseball game on TV They bump into the couch
Clay’s dad looks back menacing

CLAY’S DAD
Hey ladies Take it down a notch

The boys keep wrestling dopey from the pills Again they
knock into the couch Clay’s dad spins around pissed

CLAY’S DAD (CONTD)
What did I just say

Clay’s Dad grabs Clay pulls him off of Laser and over the
couch Clay tries to fight off his dad but slowly we realize
each is having fun rough-housing with the other

Dad soon manages to get his son in a headlock forcing the
boy’s face into his big fat sweaty armpit

CLAY
Let me go

CLAY’S DAD
Don’t do the crime if you can’t do
the time

CLAY
(laughing)
Dad your pits smell like burnt
ass Get off me

As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son
we note a trace of longing on his face

INT ROOM - DAY

We’re tight on a young WOMAN reclining on a worn day-bed as
a disembodied male voice poses questions

MALE VOICE
Would you say you’re more a)
serious or b) easy going
JONI
Serious

This is JONI ALLGOOD - 18

Hers is an unexploited beauty Joni’s a girl who cares more
about a life of the mind than the cut of her jeans someone
who’s felt the need to “ace it” from an early age

MALE VOICE
In making decisions do you feel
more comfortable with a) standards
or b) feelings

JONI
What if it’s both
MALE VOICE
You have to pick one
JONI
Standards
MALE VOICE

When the phone rings do you a)
hasten to get it first or b) hope
someone else will answer

We hear a knock and an attractive INDIAN WOMAN (40s) enters
There’s nothing traditional about her she’s culturally
American through and through

INDIAN WOMAN
Jai are you almost done

PULL BACK to reveal JAI DOSAJ 17 Joni’s best friend Jai’s
preternaturally mature an old soul in a young body

His professorial dress glasses khakis white oxford
underscores this His seriousness covers up a deep
sensitivity to others In particular Joni

JAI
Mom please we’re right in the
middle of the MyersBriggs test

MRS DOSAJ
Sorry luvvie Joni would you
like to stay for dinner
JONI
No thank you Mrs Dosaj My
mom’s are having a little shindig
for me tonight

MRS DOSAJ
Oh right Of course It’s your
birthday Jai’s been so excited--

Jai pops up cuts her off

JAI
Mom I‘11 be right down

Mrs Dosaj disappears and Joni gets up to go

JAI (CONTD)
Wait just a second

Jai reaches under his bed and pulls out an impeccably-wrapped
present He hands it to Joni

JAI (CONTD)
Here Happy Birthday

JONI
Jai you didn’t need to do that

JAI
I know
(flushed softly)
I wanted to

Joni takes off the wrapping and we see that Jai’s bought her
a pair of high-end Leica binoculars

JONI
Oh my god These are so beautiful
That was so nice Thank you

JAI
For next time

Joni gives Jai a thank-you hug As Joni parts we can tell
Jai wishes the hug would last longer
INT VOLVO STATION WAGON - DAY

A WOMAN drives in her station wagon She’s listening to a
Meditation CD by Eckhardt Tolle “The Power of Now” guru
ECKHARDT TOLLE (ON CD)
If we see our so-called limitations
with clarity precision
gentleness good-heartedness and
kindness and having seen them
fully then let go

This is JULES ALLGOOD (late 40’s)

Fair-skinned attractive and highly sensitive Jules is one
of those people forgets the boundaries a little too often
EXT STREET - LATINO NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

LUIS RAMIREZ (30s) stands in front of a beat up pick-up
truck covered in AA slogan stickers He has a thick barrio

accent and eats a snow-cone

Standing next to him is Jules anxiously writing a check

JULES
What about the smog inspection
LUIS
It passed with colors I have the
paper
(then)

You gonna drive this truck

Jules hands him the check

JULES
Yeah I’m starting a landscaping
business

JULES

design

LUIS

JULES

it didn’t work out cause I had
kids and I wasn’t totally focused

work and it’s just a better time
for me now you know what I mean

Luis takes a bite of his snow cone

LUIS
Let me know if you need someone

INT GYNECOLOGIST’S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM - DAY

Okay go ahead and get dressed

Nic throws the gooey towel away quickly heads to the door

SASHA

Sasha calls Joni a prude They love it

SASHA
Come on You worked your ass off

that overtly sexual people are
usually compensating for deep
narcissistic injuries

SASHA

JAI
Quod erat demonstrandum

JONI

SASHA
Whatever I don’t understand why

Hey grown-ups Everybody having a
good time

The kids respond positively Joni notices something

NIC
Yes sweetie

Joni mimes wiping her teeth Nic starts boozily licking at
her stained teeth then grabs Joni in a big hug

NIC (CONTD)
Look at my baby all grown up

SASHA

Nic gives Sasha a dirty look and walks off
AT THE EDGE OF THE YARD --
Clay and Laser are kung-fu fighting Laser kicks at Clay

Clay grabs his leg and takes him down to the ground They
land on top of each other

Jules watches concerned Clay breaks free and stands up

CLAY
Dude I gotta drop some friends at
the lake Back in ten

Clay walks inside Jules comes over to Laser

JULES
Honey can I ask you something

LASER

Jules puts her hand on Laser’s forearm and starts making
maternal windshield wiper strokes with her thumb

JULES
What do you get from your
relationship with Clay

LASER

person who will help you grow

INT ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
The party’s over The guests have gone Joni and Jules are

washing up by the sink Nic comes over and puts her arms
around Joni

NIC
Did your friends have a good time

JONI
Yeah they did Thanks so much

NIC
You’re so welcome
(beat)
You know I’m thinking you should
probably get a jump on your thank-
you notes tonight

One might expect a teen-ager to eye-roll this kind of
suggestion but not Joni She’s a habitual people-pleaser

JONI
Yeah that’s a good idea

JULES
Give her a second honey The
party just ended

NIC
I’m just saying it’s just easier to
knock ‘em out when it’s fresh

She also moonlights as the family referee

JONI
(to Jules)
Mom it’s fine I can start them
tonight
JULES
(to Nic)
Can’t you just let her enjoy her
evening
NIC

Look if it was up to you our kids
wouldn’t even write thank you
notes they’d just send out good
vibes

A typical married couple Nic and Jules have their menu of
pet-peeves and we’ve just witnessed one of them

INT JONI’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

True to her word Joni’s at her desk cranking out those thank-
you notes Laser knocks and enters

LASER
Hey Happy Birthday

Laser give Joni a one armed hug and hands her a present She
opens it and smirks It’s The Complete Joni Mitchell Song-
book

JONI
Very funny Laser

Laser has more business to attend to

LASER
I was wondering you know now that
youre 18
(beat)
You gonna try to find our donor

JONI
Laser I already told you

LASER
I know I was just wondering if
you changed your mind

JONI
No I haven’t

LASER
How can you not even be curious

JONI

Sorry I’m just not

(off his stare)
Look I’m leaving soon I don’t
want to deal with that right now

(co-dependent leak)
And also that could really hurt
moms’ feelings

LASER
God why do you worry about them so
much They don’t even have to know
about it

JONI
Sorry Laser but I’m not doing it
(consolation prize)
You can do it when you turn 18

Laser stands there disappointed and fuming

LASER
I never ask you for anything

Laser walks out of the room Joni feels horrible

INT NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
Nic and Jules lay in bed watching TV unwinding from the day

NIC
I just don’t understand why you
bought the truck now

JULES
(defensive)
If I’m gonna get this business
going then I’m gonna need something
to haul my equipment in Right

NIC
Okay It just seems a little
cart before the horse

JULES
What does that mean

NIC
Well you don’t even have any
clients yet

JULES
Well you’re the one who’s always
telling me to “act as if”

NIC
(back peddling)
No you’re right I’m sorry It’s
good you bought the truck

The women settle back Nic can tell she’s made Jules feel
bad She caresses her arm wanting to make it better

NIC (CONTD)
(gingerly)
Hey

Jules doesn’t look at Nic She keeps her eyes on the TV

NIC (CONTD)
Wanna watch a movie

Jules perks up Nic immediately regrets her suggestion

JULES
Really

NIC
Yeah We haven’t done that in a
while

SECONDS LATER -- NIC AND JULES

are cozied up side-by-side facing the TV

ANGLE ON - THE TV

The volume is turned low on TWO NAKED MEN lying on a chaise

long

One guy fellating the other Whatever the reason

this man-on-man action usually gets Nic and Jules going

ANGLE ON - THE BED

We now only see Nic Jules has slipped under the blanket
and is now between Nic’s legs We see Nic trying to get into
it but having a hard time

NIC (CONTD)
(squinching)
I don’t like the guys in this one
They’re too shaved

JULES
(muffled)
Don’t focus on it

NIC
How about the one with the biker
gang

JULES
We left it in Hawaii

Jules wrestles with the blankets Wants them out of her way

NIC
(pulling them back up)
I’m cold honey

JULES
Sorry I couldn’t breathe

Jules wrangles the blankets trying cover her partner The
transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top sheet

As Nic repositions herself she leans on the VOLUME CONTROL
BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume

MAN IN MOVIE
Suck that fat cock mother-fucker

NIC
Shit Wheres the remote

MAN IN MOVIE
I’m gonna fuck that tight ass

Jules and Nic both dive for the remote It’s lost under the
mass of bedding Nic finally recovers it and hits mute

NIC
Jesus Christ

Nic flops back traumatized

NIC (CONTD)
The whole neighborhood heard that

JULES
No they didn’t

NIC
Well that was a vibe kill

Jules looks ready to resume

JULES
Let it go honey

NIC
I don’t think I can

Jules comes out of the blankets and flops back on the
pillows She’s clearly disappointed

JULES
You’re the one who wanted to watch
a movie

NIC

I know I’m sorry
Nic hits the light and wraps herself tightly around Jules

NIC (CONTD)
I love you chicken

JULES
Love you too

Jules lays wide awake wondering “What just happened”

INT ALLGOOD HOUSE - HOME OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Joni’s in Nic’s home office rummaging through a desk drawer
She pulls out a FOLDER and studies the cover We see the
words “California Cryobank When You Succeed We Succeed”

Joni opens the file and looks at the documents within

CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4 YEAR-OLD BOY standing in a sandbox
looking straight into a camera with a big open grin

MATCH CUT TO

EXT FARM — DAY

We see that boy 35 years later holding up a funky-shaped
bright yellow TOMATO with that self-same open grin

This is PAUL HATFIELD Joni and Laser’s biological father

Dressed in Carhartt work-pants and worn-out vintage T-shirt
Paul has a strange attractiveness that comes from knowing he
doesn’t need to try so hard

PAUL
Can anyone tell me what this is

REVERSE ONTO a group of unbearably cute 6 year-old AFRICAN
AMERICAN and LATINO KIDS in matching blue summer program T-
shirts staring blankly at the strange looking fruit

PAUL (CONT’D)
It’s a tomato

ADORABLE KID
That’s not a tomato

PAUL
Yes it is It’s called an
heirloom tomato But you probably
don’t recognize it because you’re
used to tomatoes looking like this

Paul holds up a generic beefsteak tomato

ADORABLE KID 2
Why don’t you grow normal tomatoes
like that

PAUL
(sincere)
Because we don’t want to be normal
We want everything we grow here to
be unique and exceptional just
like you are

The kids are digging Paul And so is a young crunchy-hot
farm volunteer BROOKE who watches Paul’s talk rapt

PAUL (CONTD)
And you know what the coolest part
is I can take a big basket of
food from the garden and walk right
over there to my restaurant and
serve it to people that same day

We PULL BACK to reveal we’re in an URBAN GARDEN in the middle
of Echo Park Los Angeles And the garden is in fact
abutting a renovated commercial space which houses

See He wasn’t weird

JONI
No Not at all

The same thought crosses their minds simultaneously

JONI (CONTD)
We’re not telling moms

LASER
Yeah no way
EXT ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THAT EVENING

The family’s at dinner Joni and Laser share that “I have a
secret” look Nic turns to Laser

NIC

How was your day honey
LASER

Fine
JULES

What about you Joni

JONI
Okay

Nic raises her wine glass

NIC
Well Jules we really did it
We’ve raised two scintillating
conversationalists

INT ALLGOOD HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Nic and Jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch
watching cable They see Laser on his way out of the house

JULES
Hey bug come here We’re watching

“Locked Up Abroad Uganda”

LASER
I already saw it It was gnarly

NIC
Where are you going
LASER
Clay’s house

Jules and Nic shoot each other a concerned look

NIC

Don’t be back late okay
LASER

I know
JULES

Can I have a hug before you go
LASER

Mom
JULES

Just a quick one Please

LASER
(pointing to Nic)
Hug her That’s what she’s there
for

Laser leaves Nic hits mute on the TV looks at Jules

NIC
I don’t know what to think

JULES
Neither do I

NIC
Maybe we should just sit him down
and ask him

JULES
What “Are you and Clay fucking”

NIC
“Exploring” is the word I’d use

JULES
And what if he is “exploring”
This is the age for that Why
should we care

NIC
We shouldn’t It’s just
(beat)
I can just hear somebody saying
(MORE)

NIC (CONTD)
“Goddamn there go those gays again
spitting out more gays”

JULES
“Spitting out more gays”

NIC
(on a roll)
Look he can explore if he wants
to I just don’t understand why
he’s exploring with that loser

JULES
We don’t even know what the deal
is We’re jumping to conclusions

NIC
I feel like he has so much
potential and he’s just wasting it

Nic’s comment hits a nerve in Jules

JULES
What are you trying to say

NIC
What do you mean what am I trying
to say

JULES

I don’t know It feels like
there’s some subtext here

NIC
What are you talking about

JULES
I don’t know Like mother like son
Is that it Both of us aimless
wandering in the darkness “wasting
our potential”

NIC
What kind of pretzel logic is that

JULES
Well maybe it hasn’t risen to the
plane of consciousness for you yet

NIC
Honey you’re on a whole other
tangent and I have no idea how you
got there

Nic clicks the volume back on freezing Jules out

INT PAUL’S RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON
Paul and Tanya sit at the bar eating family-meal

TANYA
What were they like

PAUL
They were sweet They were good
kids The boy’s this kind of
gawky sensitive jock and the
girl’s kind of innocent but whip-
smart and super-cute

TANYA
Sounds like you guys connected

PAUL
You know we kinda did

TANYA
So how’d you leave it Are you
gonna see them again

PAUL
I don’t know We didn’t really
leave it anywhere

Brooke the sexy Wiccan volunteer comes up to Paul bearing a
basket of freshly-picked fruits

BROOKE
Hey Paul

Paul leans over the basket
PAUL
Whatcha got Oh cool First
strawberries of the season
BROOKE
Arent they beautiful I thought
you should have the first taste

And with that she smiles hands him the basket and leaves

TANYA
(mimicking Brooke)
“I thought you should have the
first taste
(beat)
--of my pussy”

PAUL
That’s not fair

TANYA

(softly)
Hey you wanna hook up later

Paul stiffens a bit

PAUL
I don’t think I can tonight

TANYA
(sensing a shift)
Alright when’s good

PAUL
Actually this whole week’s kind of
funky Can we figure it out later
TANYA
(hurt surprised)
Yeah Alright
INT NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Clay rummages through the top drawer of Jules’ dresser
Laser stands behind him uncomfortable

LASER
Dude I don’t think they smoke pot

CLAY
Hold up

Clay turns around holding up one of the mom’s DVDs

CLAY (CONT’D)
Dude we’re watching this

INT LASER’S ROOM - DAY

Laser and Clay sit on the bed They look at each other
giddy Then Laser hits play

ON SCREEN

We see a COP giving a young MAN a BLOW-JOB Laser and Clay
sit motionless shocked disgusted riveted

CLAY
Think the whole thing’s like this

LASER
Want me to fast-forward

Clay doesn’t answer They just keep watching

INT PAUL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The room is spare not from any aesthetic choice but from a
life spent mostly out of the house Books piled up A few
guitars on stands The vase with fresh cut flowers keeps it
from being a complete bachelor pad

Paul sits on the couch on his computer His cell rings

PAUL
Hello

JONIS VOICE (ON PHONE)
Paul

PAUL
Yes

JONI VOICE (ON PHONE)
Hey It’s Joni

Paul sits right up
PAUL
Yeah hey Of course How you
doing
EXT AROMA CAFE - CONVERSATION INTERCUT

Joni’s sitting at a wrought-iron table in the outdoor
courtyard her salad and Arnold Palmer untouched

JONI
Good I just wanted to say thanks
again for the other day

PAUL
Absolutely I really enjoyed it

JONI
Is it an okay time to talk

PAUL
It’s great What are you up to
EXT ALLGOOD HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
Jules pulls her truck into the driveway almost running over

Laser’s bike

INT LASER’S ROOM - DAY

Laser and Clay are still watching the porn

As Jules walks in the room

JULES
Laser you left your bike out

Laser reflexively flinches and grabs for the remote As he
fumbles for it Jules turns and sees what they’re watching
She looks mortified

INT ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THAT EVENING

We enter a family conference already in progress Nic and
Jules sit in chairs facing Laser who sits on the couch

Both act calm but are inwardly mortified that their 15 year-
old son found their porn

NIC
Laser your mom and I accept you
and love you unconditionally You
know that right

LASER
Yeah
NIC
And you know you can be open with
us about anything

LASER
Yeah I know

Jules steels herself for a frank discussion
JULES
Laser is there anything you want

to talk about

LASER

Like what

NIC
Anything Anything on your mind

Laser cracks his knuckles

LASER
Well there is something

Nic and Jules share a look “Here we go”

LASER (CONTD)
It’s more of a question really

NIC
That’s okay

JULES
We won’t judge you

Laser looks at his moms Nic and Jules brace themselves

LASER
Why do you guys watch gay man porn

Nic and Jules look at each other thrown
NIC
Well first I have to say we rarely

watch that movie--

Jules touches Nic’s arm

JULES
Honey

NIC
And secondly I really don’t
appreciate you snooping around our
room Was that Clay’s idea I
have to say again I don’t like
him He seems unstable

JULES
Honey that’s not what he asked--
NIC
(snapping)
Fine Do you want to answer his

question

Jules turns to Laser There’s no book for this “birds-and-
the-bees” talk

JULES

Well sweetie human sexuality is
complicated And sometimes
people’s desires can becounter-
intuitive

(soldiering on)
For instance since women’s sexual
responsiveness is mostly internal
sometimes it’s exciting for us to
see sexual responsiveness more you
know

(beat)
-externalized

Laser looks at them still baffled

JULES (CONTD)
Like with a penis

LASER
But like wouldn’t you rather watch
two women doing it

JULES
You would think that But in most
of those movies they’ve hired two
straight women to pretend and the
inauthenticity is just unbeara--

Nic cuts her off wants to get down to brass tacks
NIC
Okay that’s enough Laser your
mom and I have a sense there’s some
other stuff going on in your life
and we just want to be let in

LASER
What do you mean

JULES
Are you having a relationship with
someone

NIC
You could tell us honey We’d
understand and support you

Laser looks confused How did they find out about Paul

LASER
I just met him once

Nic and Jules share a worried look

NIC
What do you mean once

JULES
Are you cruising

LASER
What’s cruising

NIC
Who did you meet once

LASER
Paul I met him with Joni

NIC
Whos Paul

JULES
Why was Joni there

LASER
She set it up

NIC
Forget the set-up Who’s Paul
LASER
Paul Hatfield

NIC
Who the fuck is Paul Hatfield

LASER
Our sperm donor

Jules and Nic go white

LASER (CONTD)
Whod you think I was talking
about

INT ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Joni has been pulled into the family conference
Jules are trying to remain as calm as possible

JULES
Look guys we understand why you’d
be curious about your biological
father That’s totally natural

NIC
But why didn’t you tell us

JONI
Because we knew you’d be upset

NIC
WERE NOT UPSET

Jules calms her riled-up partner

JULES

Honey

(to Joni expressing her

upset more calmly)
We just wish you’d have included us
in your thinking But what’s done
is done You met him and now you
guys can move on--

JONI
(sheepish)
Actually
(beat)
I might see him again

Nic and

JULES
What

LASER
You are When did you talk to
him

JONI

(ignoring Nic to Laser)
Yesterday I was gonna tell you

NIC
Whoa Whoa No No way
(regaining dominance)
Nobody is going anywhere until we
meet him

Joni looks at Laser They knew this would happen

INT NIC AND JULES’ BATHROOM - NIGHT

As Nic and Jules Sonicare their teeth they post-mortem the
day’s revelation

NIC
Yeah I get it He’s their
biological father and all that crap
but it still feels really shitty
Like we’re not enough or something
you know

JULES
Of course I know I don’t want to
time-share our kids with someone
Not when it’s our last few months
with Joni at home

Nic pulls a clump of long wet red hair out of the sink
NIC
Jules look at this The plumber

was just here

JULES
It’s not all me

NIC
It’s a big clump of red hair

JULES
(caught)
I’m sorry

Nic throws the clump of hair in the trash

INT NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Nic and Jules get into bed
NIC
(getting tactical)
Okay look let’s be smart about
this If we act like grubby
bitches we’re just gonna make it
worse So let’s just kill him with
kindness and put it to bed
JULES
You’re right You’re absolutely
right And you know what We’re
gonna get through this Okay
Nic smiles She loves when Jules shows confidence

NIC
I love you chicken

The women bump fists They have a plan

EXT VENTURA BLVD - EVENING

Paul rides through their little hamlet taking in the prosaic
serenity of it all

EXT STREET - EVENING

Paul slows down checking addresses then cuts his engine in
front of

THE ALLGOOD’S
MINUTES LATER - PAUL

is at the door He rings Takes a breath We can tell he’s
a little nervous

NIC AND JULES --

Open the door and greet Paul with their best “kill him with
kindness” faces

NIC
Paul It is so great to meet you
I’m Nic This is Jules

Paul shakes their hands

PAUL
Hi great to meet you too

JULES
I hope the traffic wasn’t too bad

PAUL
No I’ve got my bike so
(nodding to his BMW on the
street)
I just sort of weave through

Nic clocks the motorcycle stifles the impulse to judge

NIC
(clenched)
Great Well come on in

As they enter Paul holds out a bottle of wine

PAUL
This is for you I don’t know if
you guys like wine

Nic takes it

NIC
Are you kidding We love it
(checking the label)
And a petit syrah What a treat
Let me get some glasses

Nic leaves Paul by the stairs with Jules Little silence
Jules steals a look at him unable to contain her curiosity

PAUL
(looking around)
Beautiful house How long you guys
lived here

JULES

(nervous energy)
Almost ten years

(sotto)
Wait has it been that long

(rambling nervously)
We moved right after Laser broke
his leg I remember that because we
had a ramp for a while so that
would have beenten no nine
No ten years this fall

Paul nods smiling at her nervousness

PAUL
Okay

Laser and Joni walk down the stairs and light up when they
see Paul Jules watches as Paul greets her kids with hugs
It makes her uncomfortable so she turns and heads for

THE KITCHEN --

Jules finds Nic’s pouring herself a sizable glass of wine

JULES
You okay
NIC
(not okay)

Yeah Fine

Jules feels her inner co-dependent swelling in her chest

JULES

Go easy on the wine tonight okay
NIC

Okay And same for the micro-

managing

This is going to be fun

INT ALLGOOD DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone sits at the family dinner table There’s a nervous
“Meet the Parents” energy to the proceedings

JULES
I hope the food’s okay Joni told
us you own a restaurant

PAUL
The food’s great Can’t go wrong
with grilled salmon and sweet corn

Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note

NIC
So Paul did you always know you
wanted to be in food services
industry

Paul smiles at Nic trying to disarm her

PAUL
No I came to it in sort of a
roundabout way I started off in
grad school studying philosophy

JULES
Really that’s so interesting

PAUL
Actually it was mind-numbingly
boring and had nothing to do with
real life so I left and joined the
Peace Corps

JONI
Really That’s so cool Where’d
they send you

PAUL
To Burundi In East Africa

JONI
(loving her bio-dad)
Wow How was that

PAUL
Really incredible I lived ina
little village for two years I
helped them set up an irrigation
system that kept them from losing
their farms to soil erosion
That’s how I got into sustainable
farming And how I ultimately got
into
(smiling for Nic’s
benefit)
-the food services industry

LASER
(smart-ass)
See what he did there mom You
said “food services industry” then
he said “food services industry”

NIC
Yeah I got it Laser Thanks
(apropos of nothing)
So Paul what about your social
life

PAUL
My social life

NIC
You know are you married
divorced seeing anyone

JONI
(mortified)
Mom

NIC
What We’re getting to know Paul

PAUL
No never been married or divorced
I’m kind of dating but honestly
I’ve been kind of focussed on my
work for the last couple years

NIC
Well you’re a successful
attractive guy You won’t have any
trouble starting a family of your
own when you’re ready

Paul gets Nic’s subtext Momma Bear is protecting her cubs

PAUL
No I’m sure it will all work out
(to Jules and Nic)
So how did you two meet

Jules smiles at Nic
JULES

It’s not a particularly romantic
story We met at a Dunkin Donuts
PAUL
Really

JULES
Believe it or not they have
amazing coffee

PAUL
I’ve heard that So when was this

JULES
When was that honey It’s over
twenty years ago

NIC
Well we were both in Boston I
was doing my residency and you were
working for that architect

JULES
Right So every morning at 7 wed
both go to the same Dunkin Donuts

NIC
I don’t know if she was aware of
me but I was highly aware of her

JULES
Of course I was aware of you Id
go there on my days off

You can tell the ladies love telling this story

NIC
She always ordered the same thing
A medium coffee room for cream
and a bearclaw

JULES
God I could never get away with
that now

NIC

Anyway after weeks of this coy
coffee flirtation I finally said
screw it I bought a medium coffee
and a bear claw went up to her and
said “You get the next one”

Nic puts her hand on Jules’ and strokes it
JULES
And weve been together ever since

THUD We turn to see Laser head on the table bored

JULES (CONTD)
Hey that’s not nice

LASER
What’s not nice is subjecting your
kids to the same story 1000 times

Jules pulls him up by the hair and kisses him

PAUL
(moving on)
So Nic I know you’re a doctor
Jules you still in architecture

JULES
No I never became an architect I
mean I never finished my program
I’ve basically just been a full-
time mom

PAUL
Well I wouldn’t say “just” You
raised some great kids

JULES
Thanks
(then)
Actually I’m in the process of
starting a new business

PAUL
Oh yeah What kind

JULES

Landscape design

(before he can respond)
But not like a gardener I mean
yes there is a gardening component
to it but the real work is
creating unique eco-friendly
outdoor spaces that harmonize with
the surrounding environment Do
you know what I mean

PAUL
Absolutely

In Nic’s mind Jules is drowning in verbiage So she jumps
in to save her

NIC
Hey Paul did Joni tell you about
the speech she gave at her
graduation

PAUL
No she didn’t

NIC
It was incredible So full of
wisdom and hope
(turning to her Joni)
Hon go upstairs and get it I’m
sure he’d love to hear it

JONI
(blushing)
No mom I’m sure he wouldn’t
NIC
Sure he would Come on Go get
it
JONI

(getting upset)
No it’s okay

NIC
Why are you so embarrassed

JONI
I’m not embarrassed Just give it
a rest already God

This outburst stuns Nic into silence Her daughter has never
spoken to her like this Laser stands up

LASER
I’ll get the ice-cream

JONI
(standing up)
I’1l help you

Joni and Laser leave the room Nic pours herself the last of
Paul’s petit syrah Jules smiles covering her anxiety

JULES
(softly)
Sweetie that’s your forth glass

NIC
Actually it’s my third But
thanks for counting

Things are turning gnarly at the Allgood house Paul turns
to Jules

PAUL
Hey I was just thinking You
know I bought this place last year
and the back yard’s a wreck I was
planning on doing something with it
myself but I’ve just been so busy
with everythingI don’t know
would you be interested in working
on it

JULES
Seriously

PAUL
Yeah Absolutely

JULES
Okay
(suddenly excited)
Yeah That sounds great

Jules smiles at Nic “Isn’t this great My first client”
Nic looks less than pleased

EXT ALLGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT
Laser and Joni walk Paul out to his bike

JONI
Sorry about my moms They can be
kind of intense

PAUL
They were probably a little
anxious
(beat)
You think I passed

LASER
Dude you just hired my mom Of
course you passed

PAUL
(to Laser)
So we’re on for Saturday

LASER
(beaming)
Yeah

JONI
(marking her territory)
And I’m coming on Sunday remember

PAUL
I didn’t forget

Paul touches Joni’s arm then reaches for Laser’s hand

PAUL (CONTD)
Well thanks for having me out
guys It was great to meet the
parents

Laser takes his hand and starts doing the hand-shake routine
his friends are doing at school Paul does his best to go
with it It ends with a snap and a point

PAUL (CONTD)
Okay See you guys later

INT HOME DEPOT - DAY

Nic and Jules walk through the fertilizer section Jules
puts a couple BAGS in a CART

NIC
We had a plan Jules Remember

JULES
You’re unbelievable Youre all
over me about getting clients and
when I finally get one you’re all
over me about that

NIC
He’s not just a client Jules
He’s our kids’ sperm donor
(MORE)

NIC (CONTD)

Have you ever heard the phrase
“Don’t Shit Where You Eat”

JULES
Yes and I think it’s disgusting

NIC
Well what if he’s not happy with
your work That could be really
uncomfortable for the kids

JULES
Why would you assume he’d hate my
work

NIC

I didn’t say “hate”

(looking at the bag)
Jesus when did fertilizer get so
expensive

JULES
Look I’m sorry He seems like a
good person to me

NIC
Yeah well he seems a little
polished if you ask me

JULES
So what’s wrong with polish

NIC
In my experience people polish
themselves to conceal dirt

JULES
Why do you have to assume the worst
in people

Standing up for herself Jules takes another bag of expensive
fertilizer throws it in the cart and takes off ahead of Nic

EXT PAUL’S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

Jules stands with Paul leafing through a LOOK-BOOK of design
concepts Jules is dressed in her work garb a tad geeky
ready to dig in

To the side Luis the man she bought the truck from earlier
(and whom she’s hired as her assistant) is taking a weed-
whacker to the overgrown back-yard

JULES

(to Paul)
this is interesting kind of a
Secret Garden thing with trellises
and topiary

(clocking his face)
or we could do something more
like this which has a more Asian
minimal rock garden feel It’s up
to you

PAUL
What do you think

JULES
Personally I’m tired of less is
more I think you should go for
more is more Let’s not try to
tame the space I think it would
look great all lush and overgrown
and fecund

PAUL
Did you just say fecund

JULES
I’m sorry you know fertile

PAUL
No I love that word You just
don’t hear it that often

(thinking)
More is more I like it lLet’s go
for it

Jules is staring at Paul

PAUL (CONTD)
What

JULES
Sorry I’m just seeing my kids in
your expressions

Jules looks more intensely at Paul’s face

JULES (CONTD)
You and Laser have the same mouth

The observation strikes Paul Suddenly he’s feeling a kind
of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn’t expected

PAUL
You think so

JULES
Yeah

They keep looking at each other Until they realize Luis is
standing two feet away Jules turns to Luis

JULES (CONTD)
What’s up

LUIS
It’s lunch time

JULES
Okay

Luis sneezes repeatedly into a hankie then looks up at
Jules

LUIS

I’m going to McDonalds
JULES

Okay
LUIS

You want any
JULES
No Thanks I’m fine
EXT BACKYARD - ALLGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

Jules and Laser are in the midst of a Ping-Pong match as Nic
home from work still in scrubs approaches

NIC
What’s the score

JULES
Pretty close

Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules

LASER
19-3

NIC
So how’d it go today
JULES
Great We settled on a concept

NIC
What is it

JULES
It’s hard to explain You have to
kind of see the space to get it

NIC

(to Laser)
Laser did you write Pup-pup a Get
Well card
(off his silence)
Laser What do I have to do I
bought you a card I left it on
your desk All you had to do was--

LASER
Mom settle I will

Laser cracks another winner

NIC
Don’t tell me to settle mister
And if it’s not in the mail by
tomorrow morning we’re not going
to the Dodger game Saturday

LASER
Whatever I have other plans
anyway
(to Jules)
Game point

NIC
What other plans
(off his silence)
I’m asking you a quest--

LASER
I’m doing something with Paul

Laser serves a rocket whizzing past a flailing Jules
tosses the racquet on the table and leaves Nic yells

NIC
You used to be so cute

He

EXT CLAY’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

We cut onto Paul and Laser looking up at something Laser
is holding a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA

PAUL
This may not be a good idea

LASER
You may be right

CLAY (0S)
Dude are you filming

We cut to Clay standing in the crotch of a tall OAK TREE
twenty feet up

CLAY (CONTD)
I’m only doing this once You
better keep my shit in frame

We cut back to Paul and Laser standing below

PAUL
(to Laser)
He’s not gonna make it
(calling up to Clay)
Clay seriously you’re not gonna
make it

LASER
He’s right man Don’t do it

CLAY
Dude when did you become such a
Man-gina

Laser sighs then holds up the camera Paul looks at Laser
wondering why he puts up with this guy

VIDEO CAMERA’S POV We watch as Clay psychs himself up with
an assortment of deep breaths and head-slaps

Finally he swings his arms and LEAPS from the tree aiming
for another one ten feet away Mid-air he reaches for the
other tree’s branches but falls a couple feet short He
lands with a nauseating THUD The camera drops as we see
Laser’s feet rushing over to a howling Clay

EXT ALLGOOD HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY
Paul and Laser walk to the front of the house

PAUL
Maybe next time we can hang out
just you and me

LASER
Clay’s cool He’s just gets a
little amped sometimes

PAUL
Most cool people I know aren’t
jerks to their friends

Paul’s observation hits Laser Laser looks down
PAUL (CONTD)
I’m sorry I just didn’t like the
way he was talking to you

LASER
Yeah no I get it

PAUL
Hey you hungry

LASER
Yeah Kind of

PAUL
You want some Fatburger

Laser looks back up smiling

LASER
Alright

Paul puts his hands on Laser’s shoulders Just as we think
it’s gonna turn into a hug Paul sticks his leg behind Laser
and trips him Laser laughs

LASER (CONTD)
Dude

Paul takes off and Laser chases after him

INT NIC AND JULES’ BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin Pjs sitting at the
rim of a RUNNING BATH There are candles burning Roberta
Flack’s “Where is the Love” plays in the background

JULES
Wow What’s this

NIC
Come here Sit down

Jules takes a seat beside her Nic holds her hand

NIC (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’ve been such a bitch
lately I know I haven’t been my
highest self

JULES
Yeah well

NIC
Youve been really patient with me
And I just want you to know that
hasn’t gone unrecognized

Nic gives her a long sweet kiss Jules is warming up

NIC (CONTD)
Get in

In the tub revelling in the warm bubbly water Nic is
sitting on the ledge gently massaging her shoulders

JULES
Perfect

NIC
Not too hot

Nic checks in the compartment under the sink

NIC (CONTD)
I don’t see them

JULES
They may be in the hallway closet

Nic walks to the door gives her a little vamp treatment

NIC
Waitrightthere

Nic exits Jules sinks into the tub luxuriating in the
decadence of it all

TIME CUT TO
JULES

still waiting for Nic To pass the time she’s listening to
some Eckhardt Tolle on her Ipod

ECKHARDT TOLLE
Seeking security or perfection
rejoicing in feeling confirmed and
whole self-contained and
comfortable is some kind of death

TIME CUT TO

JULES
Still waiting She’s getting cold And impatient

JULES
Nic

Jules is getting pissed
TIME CUT TO

IN THE KITCHEN

Nic is on her cell with a patient
NIC
Well you just had a C-section
That’s major surgery

Jules enters in a robe wondering what the hell happened
Nic turns and sees her raises a finger “so sorry wait”

NIC (CONTD)
Can’t dad hold the baby Don’t
feel guilty It’s half his

Jules can’t believe Nic is indulging a non-emergency work
call at this moment She leaves

BACK IN THE BATHROOM - JULES

Re-enters Walks over to the tub Smacks the drain open
She sits down on the edge and starts crying

INTEXT PAUL’S HOUSE - DAY

Paul watches Jules at work in his back-yard He studies her
face intently bent on its task Luis hauls shrubs away
INT PAULS HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Paul and Jules stand at the kitchen table looking over her

meticulously rendered sketch for the yard Her eyes are
puffy from last night’s cry

PAUL
Are you okay Your eyes look kind
of

JULES

Like shit right

PAUL
I was gonna say puffy

JULES
I’m fine I just had a little
meltdown last night

PAUL
About what

JULES

(realizing she’s divulged

too much)
Nothing It was stupid Look I’m
gonna go to the nursery in the
morning so we should probably make
sure you’re signed off on the wood
for the trellis

Jules looks over at a pan of something delicious-looking on
the kitchen counter

JULES (CONTD)
What’s that

PAUL
Strawberry rhubarb pie Fresh from
my garden

Paul hands her a fork and she takes a big bite Her eyes
roll back in her head

PAUL (CONTD)

crazy I think she’s menopausal

PAUL
Why what’s she doing

It’s like she doesn’t want to admit
that I’m an adult

PAUL
That’s what parents do sometimes
They try to hold on But you gotta
push back Draw the line

JONI
I know I’m just not good at
pushing back

PAUL
I don’t know about that You were
pretty good that night with your
graduation speech

PAUL

How about Jules Is she bugging
you too

JONI
Not like Nic But she can be
annoying in her own way

PAUL
(interest piqued)
Oh yeah How so

JONI
She’s just way too into “processing
everyone’s feelings” and making
sure everyone’s “speaking their
truth”

PAUL
(defending her)
Well that’s not a bad thing

JONI
Yeah no it’s not But ata
certain point it’s like turn off
the Power of Now and get on with
it you know

Nic looks at Jules and smiles Everyone nods They
recognize this is a big step for Nic

I don’t know Maybe I do The
whole thing just kind of scares me

PAUL
What are you scared of
JONI
I don’t know It’s kind of lame
PAUL
Try me
JONI

I guess I’m scared if I’11 let
myself like him like that then
he’1l stop liking me and then I’11
be really hurt

PAUL
That shouldn’t stop you from taking
the risk I mean I’m sure you
were scared to call me but you
did and look what happened

JONI
You know what the funny thing is
At the beginning I didn’t even
want to meet you

PAUL
Arent you glad you did

JONI
Yeah

It’s a sweet moment but the intimacy makes Joni nervous

JONI (CONTD)
So what about you Why aren’t you
with anyone

The truth that he’s sleeping with her mom flummoxes him

PAUL
I don’t know I’m a weird one

JONI
I thought you wanted to have a
family

PAUL
Yeah I do

JONI
So what’s the problem

PAUL
I don’t know I date a lot of
women I just can’t seem to get to
the next stage with anyone

JONI

lot of women and get your eyes on
the prize

(patting him on the

shoulder sweetly)
No offense Paul but you’re kind
of getting up there

PAUL
Thanks for the reminder

Paul pokes Joni affectionately She giggles

should do that anymore

Tanya’s face drops

TANYA
What happened

PAUL
I just feel like I’m being unfair
to you Like I’m being lazy

TANYA
What do you mean

PAUL
If I really want a family then I
have to stop getting in these
situations that don’t go anywhere
I mean our thing is totally fun
and easy butI just don’t want
to be 50 and still “hanging out”

TANYA
Okay so what are you saying I
mean I’m all for going to that
next step

Paul realizes he’s gonna have to spell it out But Tanya
catches on before he has to

TANYA (CONTD)

Oh

(welling up)
You just don’t want to go there
with me

Paul knows enough to say nothing Tanya walks off leaving
Paul to feel like an asshole for finally calling it

INT PAULS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MAGIC HOUR

Paul gets dinner ready with Joni and Laser as his sous-chefs
Both kids seem really psyched to be cooking with him

IN THE BACKYARD --

Jules tours Nic around the back yard looking a little
insecure as she shows her the work she’s been doing

JULES
(defensive)
I’m gonna do some planting over so
it won’t look so bare and the
trellis is gonna look a lot better
when the vines comes in

NIC

Honey It looks great It all
feels really organically put
together I’m really proud of you

JULES

Thanks

Nic pulls her into a hug Jules is so unaccustomed to this
kind of unadulterated positivity from Nic that it throws her

INT PAULS HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER

We enter mid-meal Joni Mitchell playing on the stereo
Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves Especially Nic
who’s committed to redeeming herself Paul walks up to Nic
with a bottle of opened red

PAUL
Hey Nic you’re gonna love this ‘98
Screaming Eagle

Nic puts her hand on her glass

NIC
I think I’m gonna stick with water
tonight But thank you so much

The Allgoods look at Nic this is a first

NIC (CONTD)
(moving on)

God Paul this steak is delicious

What’s the seasoning

PAUL
I just mist it with a little
truffle oil

Nic looks at Jules and smiles in full overcompensation mode

NIC
What a good idea We should try
that Right honey

JULES
(taken aback by Nic’s
cheerfulness)
Mmm-—hmmm

NIC
And it’s done to perfection

PAUL
Good so it’s not too rare

NIC
No it’s perfect Juicy Tender
Exactly what rare’s supposed to be

PAUL
Good A lot of people in the
restaurant order a steak rare and
they freak out at the slightest
sight of red

NIC
Ugh isn’t that annoying That
happens to me all the time when I’m

grilling

PAUL
Don’t people know that rare means
red

NIC

Right It means bloody

PAUL
Exactly They should see what rare
looks like in Argentina The cow’s
practically still mooing

Laser laughs at Paul’s joke Joni tries to insert herself
the conversation

JONI
I really want to go to Argentina
Buenos Aires is supposed to be

Not really We just named our
daughter after her

PAUL
Really

NIC
What’s your favorite Joni album

PAUL
Hmm Well “Hejira” and “Court and
Spark” are definitely up there but
if I had to give you one it would
probably be “Blue”

Nic testifies with a raised hand and a bowed head

PAUL (CONTD)
Yeah You too

NIC

school in my room crying over that
album That record kills me

PAUL
I know it never lets up you got
“River” “California”

NIC

“A Case of you”

PAUL
“Bll I want”

PAUL NIC
When I think of your My mind see-saws

kisses

Paul stops and Nic goes off on a solo mimicking Joni
Mitchell’s haunting falsetto Unfortunately for the table
nobody sounds like Joni except Joni So Nic just ends up
sounding like an over-emotional reject from American Idol

NIC (CONTD)
Do you seedo you seedo you
see how you hu-urt me babyso I
hurt you toothen we both
getSO00-000-000 blue

Nic stops eyes still closed She’s connected to a part of
herself she rarely lets herself visit The moment is
punctured by her smart-ass 15 year-old son

LASER
Don’t quit your day job mom

Nic’s hurt by the jab Paul notices

PAUL
Hey It hard enough to open your
heart in this world Don’t make it
harder

I’m sorry mom

Nic looks at Paul Stunned Then she looks at Jules and
points to Paul

INT NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - MID-MORNING

Everyone’s gone except Jules Jules lies on her bed
traumatized listening to Eckhardt on her Ipod sound-dock

ECKHARDT TOLLE
We can’t let other peoples
expectations control us
The calming words of Eckhardt are having an unintended effect
on Jules Instead of easing her pain they’re just making
her feel like more of a phony
ECKHARDT TOLLE (CONTD)
We must learn that sometimes it
is okay to disappoint people
Jules bolts up grabs the Ipod from the doc

JULES
Shut the fuck up

and hurls it against the wall

twenty or so kids hanging out listening to music talking
drinking the usual

Across the room Joni spots Jai chatting with a WAIFY GIRL in
a sundress The kind of girl whose sentences always seem to
end with a question-mark The kind of girl Joni detests

Joni walks up to Jai and Waify girl interrupting them
JAI
Hey

Waify girl juts out her hip territorially
WAIFY GIRL

Jai pulls back

JAI
What do you want to talk about

JONI
My mom Jules is sleeping with my
donor dad

JAI
Fuck That’s deep Are you okay

so many times in the last few days
It’s just made me think about you
and how much I miss talking to you
How much I miss you

Jai is back to being a bowl of jelly for Joni

JAI
I miss you too

Joni looks at her friend Who she now realizes is more than
a friend She takes his face and kisses him After a
moment Jai pulls back

JAI (CONTD)
You’re just doing this cause you’re
upset Which is a perfectly
natural reaction to what you’re--

She puts her hand to his mouth

JONI
Stop analyzing me and kiss me

Her wish is his command Jai mans up and lays a big fat
passionate kiss on her

HOUR LATER --

We’re still at the party We see MOS shots of Joni and Jai
hanging out arm-in-arm a couple at last They do a shot of
tequila with Sasha (as Waify girl looks on pissed) They
dance They kiss some more They do another shot Joni

walks in front of them picks up the remote and turns off the
TV

JULES
I need to say something

Everyone sits up Jules has a look of strength and
resolution we’ve yet to see before

JULES (CONTD)

Look it’s no secret your mom and I
have been going through a rough
patch lately That’s happens in
marriages especially ones that
have lasted as long as ours But
instead of looking at our problems
and trying to deal with them head-
on I went and did something really
stupid It may be shocking to you
but adults aren’t exempt from
making mistakes Anyway I know
you’re all really furious with me
I can take that I’ma big girl
But what I can’t take is the
thought that my bad decisions have
ruined your relationship with a
good man

(preempting Nic)
Call him what you want Nic but
Paul’s a good guy No he isn’t
blameless he was there too But
if I’m gonna be honest about it
the person who really pushed it was
me

(beat to the kids)
I know this whole thing’s
confusing I wish it wasn’t But
life’s just like that sometimes

And with that Jules hands the remote back to Laser and
departs the field Everyone’s shocked by Jules’ show of
strength especially Nic

Nic gently pushes Jules onto the bed lays on top of her and
starts kissing her neck Jules is loving it But then she
gets an impulse

Jules flips Nic onto her back lays on top of her and starts
kissing her neck in the exact same way

Nic starts laughing Her bottom’s now a top

maternal melt-down Nic soldiers on

NIC (CONTD)
I’ve been thinking about what you
said to me about my wanting to
show everybody what a perfect
lesbian family I have

JONI
Mom forget about that--

NIC
No you were right Part of it was
vanity But the bigger part was
just wanting the best for you I

go They keep holding her and crying

Slowly their tears begin to break Joni down

Trapped in their loving embrace Joni’s feelings rise up
unbidden overpowering her She starts crying

The moms hold her tighter which makes her cry even harder

Soon she’s sobbing in her mothers’ arms as all the pressure
resentment and anger she’s felt starts seeping out of her
