MADDIE is sitting on a fallen log crying She wipes away the
tears as MIKE approaches

MIKE sits down beside MADDIE and puts his arm round her

MIKE

little sigh smiles and takes it MIKE leads MADDIE through
the trees and back to the clearing he found As theyre

MIKE

MADDIE looks down and turns her foot slightly to show off
her shoes

MADDIE

very practical are they

MADDIE
Theyre ok
EXT CLEARING DAY
MIKE and MADDIE come through the trees to join the others

DYLAN
Whats up Maddie Did you break a
nail

DYLAN sniggers and MADDIE looks daggers at him She mutters
under her breath

MADDIE
You jerk

CARLY looks up from rummaging in her bag

CARLY
Leave her alone Dylan

MIKE grabs his tent from the ground and starts to unpack it

MIKE
Right lets get these tents up
then we can go and explore and
get some fire wood

Between them they have 3 tents DYLAN has his own as he
refuses to share with anyone else MIKE and BRAD are sharing
one and MADDIE and CARLY are sharing the other As CARLY
unpacks the tent MADDIE sits down and slips one of her
shoes off She starts to rub her foot

MADDIE
My feet are killing me I dont
think I can stand any longer

CARLY looks across at her

CARLY
Is that your way of saying Carly
youll have to do the tent by
yourself

MADDIE
Oh thats nice of you to offer
thanks

CARLY sighs and turns back to the tent She doesnt look
happy at all but she knows that shes going to have to
share a tent with MADDIE and really doesnt want her moody
the whole time so she doesnt say anything

The guys seem to be doing well with their tents DYLAN has
finished his and is pacing around kicking stones about MIKE
is just securing the last of the guy ropes on theirs BRAD
comes over to the girls
BRAD
You girls ok

MADDIE
Yes were fine Brad

BRAD looks at MADDIE just sitting there while CARLYs doing
all the work

BRAD

CARLY looks over her shoulder to BRAD

CARLY
Yeah sure some help would be
great thanks

CARLY lets BRAD take over and the tent is up in no time
MIKE comes over to them

MIKE
Right now theyre all sorted
lets go and explore

He rubs his hands together and looks over to DYLAN

MIKE
Dylan you coming

DYLAN
Well Im not about to stay here
by myself I hope little princess
Maddie there doesnt moan the
whole time though

MADDIE turns to look at DYLAN

MADDIE
Shut up Dylan I dont moan And
anyway youd moan if your feet
hurt as much as mine do

DYLAN laughs in disbelief

DYLAN
Your feet hurt I wonder why that
could be You dont think it could
have something to do with those
stupid shoes that are on your
feet do you
MADDIE
What is the problem with my
shoes

MIKE

They are a little inappropiate
dont ya think

CARLY
Yeah Maddie why dont you change
them You dont want to ruin them
do you

MADDIE gives a big sigh then she gets up and goes to her
rucksack She starts rummaging through it and brings out
some flip flops followed by some stillettos

BRAD
My god Maddie Youre in the
woods not going to the prom
CARLY
Dont you have anything a little
more erm practical

MADDIE holds up the flip flops

MADDIE
These are flat

DYLAN starts laughing he cant believe how stupid MADDIE
is MADDIE looks at him crossly

CARLY
Tell you what why dont you
borrow my spare trainers

MIKE
Thats a good idea

MADDIE looks horrified at the thought of wearing CARLYs
scruffy trainers but she reluctantly agrees

MADDIE
I suppose I could

MADDIE points to DYLAN accusingly

MADDIE
At least itd shut him up

DYLAN just laughs and shakes his head
BRAD
Will you two just stop winding
each other up for 5 minutes

MADDIE puts CARLYs trainers on all with a disgusted look
on her face then they all pack their bags into their tents
and head off into the woods

EXT CAMP LATER IN DAY

The clearing is quiet the only sounds are of animals in the
woods round and about Suddenly the peaceful quiet is
shattered by arguing and shouting At first the sounds are
in the distance but they are being made by people coming
towards the camp

DYLAN
(OS)
You guys bring me here into the
middle of nowhere and then have

the cheek to have a go at me Its

bloody ridiculous

MIKE
(OS)
No one was having we just asked
you to help carry some wood for
the fire thats all

DYLAN storms through the trees into the clearing
angry He stops and turns towards the others

Hes very

DYLAN
Yeah its funny how little miss
princess there isnt expected to
carry anything Oh sorry I
forgot we cant have her breaking
a nail

MADDIE
What Im carrying some
your problem

Whats

DY

LAN

Maddie carrying a twig

Sure enough MADDIE has a small
others come into view theyre
to make a fire MIKE walks to
tents and puts the wood down

l twig in her hand As the

all carrying handfuls of wood
the area in front of their
The others follow and put

their wood down as well MADD

delicately puts it on top of the pile

laugh

E brings her twig and
MIKE gives a little
BRAD
Lets crack open the beers that
should relax us all

DYLAN
Beer Im getting my vodka out

MIKE makes up the fire and gets it going BRAD disappears
into the tent to find the beers CARLY brings some hot dogs
and beans over to MIKE at the fire to be cooked MADDIE sits
down and changes back to her own shoes

MIKE and CARLY finish the cooking and serve it out to
everyone CARLY passes a plate of food over to DYLAN who is
supping vodka from the bottle Hes already finished half
the bottle No one really says much while they eat theyre
all enjoying the quiet as they watch the sun go down
Everyone seems relaxed until DYLAN lets out a loud belch

MADDIE
You are so disgusting Did you
really have to do that

DYLAN gets up with the vodka bottle in one hand and staggers
over to MADDIE hes obviously drunk He bends down and puts
his face close to MADDIEs as though hes going to whisper
something to her then he lets out another belch right in
her face MADDIE pushes DYLAN away roughly He staggers back
and falls into CARLYs lap

DYLAN
Ooops

He turns to CARLY

DYLAN
Hello babe how you doing

CARLY
Get off me Dylan

She pushes him away
DYLAN
What is it with you guys Youre
all so moody and boring Im off
to find someone fun

DYLAN walks off into the trees

CARLY
Shouldnt one of us go after him
MADDIE
I say leave him hes nothing but
trouble

MIKE sits and stares in the direction that DYLAN left in

MIKE
Maybe I should go after him bring
him back

BRAD

I wouldnt bother you know what
hes like and hes so dunk I
cant see him getting very far
Hell walk a few yards then turn
around and come back

EXT DENSE FOREST LATE EVENING

Deep in the trees DYLAN is swearing and cursing at the
branches that are getting in his way Hes drinking the
vodka as he goes Hes been walking a while when he comes
across another clearing

EXT 2ND CLEARING NIGHT

DYLAN
Where have they gone Whos stolen
my tent This is just bloody great
this is theyve all buggered off
and left me

DYLAN flops down onto the ground and drinks the last couple
of mouthfuls of the vodka He lies back and looks up at the
moon Hes convinced that all his friends have left him he
doesnt realise that hes actually in a different clearing
The empty vodka bottle drops from his hand as he closes his
eyes and falls asleep

EXT CLEARING NIGHT
Back at the camp everyone is getting worried about DYLAN

CARLY
Hes not back yet and its dark
maybe we should go and look for
him

MIKE

I reckon hes sleeping it off
somewhere Its too dangerous to
go wandering into the forest now
and its so dark theres no chance
wed find him Well have to hope
hes ok and go and look for him in
the morning if he hasnt returned

BRAD
Whats the betting he comes
stumbling into camp when were all
sleeping and wakes us all up

CARLY
Hmmm maybe

The friends sit drinking and having a laugh before crawling
into their tents for the night They all shout goodnight to
each other

EXT 2ND CLEARING NIGHT

DYLAN is laid fast asleep hes snoring loudly The empty
vodka bottle is laid at his side

The sound of footsteps are heard approaching the camp A
branch breaks loudly

DYLAN awakens from his drunken slumber He sits up suddenly

DYLAN
Where am I Where is everyone

He hears the sound of something approaching the clearing

DYLAN
Mike Is that you Brad

The footsteps seem to be circling the clearing

DYLAN
Come on guys stop messing around
youve had your fun now

Silence

DYLAN strains his eyes to try and see whats lurking in the
trees ahead of him Its too dark though and he cant see
anything

DYLAN
Hello Is there anyone there

He jumps suddenly as he sees a dark shape move behind a
tree DYLAN quickly gets to his feet Hes not sure what
hes just seen but it certainly didnt look like one of his
friends He takes a step forward to try and make out what
the shape is

Suddenly he screams as he sees a hairy hand on the tree in
front of him Hes not going to wait around to see what the
hand belongs to and turns and runs the opposite way into
the trees

DYLAN is really panicking as he desperately tries to find
his way back to the camp and his friends As he runs through
the trees he keeps turning round to check behind him hes
sure he can hear something following him As he runs blindly
through the forest he doesnt notice the steep drop in
front of him until its too late His foot slips and he
starts sliding down the steep drop He tries to grab at
anything he can to stop himself falling but to no avail He
slides down the steep embankment and hits the bottom hard
Hes stunned for a few seconds He tries to get up but his
foot hurts too much to take his weight DYLAN looks around
and listens intently for any sound that may indicate that
hatever he saw is still following Hes no idea where he is
nd is to afraid to call for help in case he alerts the
reature to where he is He looks at his watch - 4am —- he
ecides to stay quiet and wait where he is he knows that

he sun will be rising soon and then he can try and work out
here he is and get back to the camp

2tQAawve

EXT CAMP EARLY MORNING

The camp begins to stir The zip slowly opens on the boys
tent and MADDIE sneaks out She looks around to check that
no one is about then she slips on her heels and makes her
way back to her tent She opens the zip and slips inside

INT GIRLS TENT EARLY MORNING
CARLY begins to stir

CARLY
Wh-what time is it

MADDIE looks at her watch

MADDIE

MADDIE looks down at the shirt shes wearing and then looks
back to CARLY a glint in her eye CARLY looks suprised

CARLY

MADDIE nods her head with a mischievous smile on her face

CARLY
Soyou and Mike Did

MADDIE nods her head
MADDIE

But you must keep it quiet we

CARLY
What about Brad

MADDIE
What about Brad He doesnt need
to know anything

CARLY
But wasnt he in the tent Surely
he already knows

MADDIE
Brad knows nothing he was fast
asleep the whole time and we you
know kept it quiet

MADDIE giggles while CARLY sits and looks at her with her
mouth open

MADDIE
Lets try and get another hour or
2 sleep Im pooped

MADDIE slips her shoes off and climbs into her sleeping bag
still wearing MIKEs shirt CARLY is shocked and slightly
jealous to think that MIKE and MADDIE spent the night
together She lies there staring at MADDIE for a bit then
she lets out a big sigh turns onto her back and stares at
the roof of the tent

INT GIRLS TENT LATER IN MORNING

CARLY awakens with a start she opens her eyes and suddenly
sits up in bed

MIKE
(OS)
Come on girls time to rise and
shine

CARLY rubs her eyes and looks for her phone to check what
time it is - 930am She looks to the side of her to see
MADDIE sleeping soundly
CARLY
(quietly to
herself)
Mustve been a bad dream

MADDIE turns over and CARLY sees that shes wearing MIKEs
shirt A look of horror comes across CARLYs face as she
realises that it wasnt a dream MADDIE has in fact slept
with MIKE

EXT CAMP SAME TIME

Outside the tent BRAD is peering into DYLANs tent

BRAD
Dylan You there mate

Silence

BRAD unzips the tent properly and looks inside
INT DYLANS TENT SAME TIME

DYLANs sleeping bag is empty

EXT CAMP SAME TIME

BRAD backs out of the tent and then turns to MIKE whos
standing outside the girls tent

BRAD
Theres no sign of Dylan in there

MIKE looks a little concerned

MIKE
Well have to go and look for him

MIKE turns back to the tent where the girls are

MIKE
Come on you two we need to go

CARLYs voice comes from inside the tent

CARLY
(OS)
What you mean he didnt come back

MIKE
His tent is empty

CARLYs head peers through the slightly open zip She looks
up at MIKE

CARLY
Hell be ok wont he

MIKE

CARLY
Ok Ill wake Maddie up then we

CARLY disappears back inside the tent as MIKE walks over to
where BRAD is sitting on a log

EXT BOTTOM OF RAVINE MORNING

DYLAN once again tries to stand His foot feels a little
better but is still really sore He looks around and tries
to work out where he is

DYLAN
Brad Mike Anyone

Silence

DYLAN
(under his
breath)
I hope that thing has gone

Using trees to help him DYLAN limps along looking for the
camp

EXT CAMP MORNING
The friends are getting ready to set off and look for DYLAN

MADDIE
Have you tried phoning him If we
phone him we wont have to spend
all day looking for him

BRAD
I looked at my phone before Ive
got no signal round here

CARLY
Me neither
MIKE
Yeah Ive been here before no
one can ever get a signal Thats
why its so nice no one from the
outside world can spoil it

MIKE looks round at his friends

MIKE
Right how do you think we should
do this Should we all go together
or are you guys happy to split up
so we can cover more ground
quicker

BRAD and CARLY nod MADDIE quickly goes to MIKE and grabs
his arm She gazes up at him

MADDIE

BRAD and CARLY look at each other

CARLY
Looks like its me and you then
Brad

BRAD

He smiles at her

MIKE

MIKE points to one side of the camp

MIKE

MIKE looks at his watch

MIKE
Its 1030 now well meet back

or not

CARLY
Ok hopefully well have found
him I mean he cant be that far
away surely

They set off in opposite directions with MIKE and MADDIE
going one way and BRAD and CARLY going the other

EXT FOREST LATER IN MORNING

DYLAN is staggering through the forest He keeps looking
behind him hes convinced that something is following him
He tries to move faster but his injured foot wont allow
him to DYLAN is panicking more and more at every sound he
hears around him

EXT FOREST SAME TIME

In a different part of the forest MIKE and MADDIE are
looking for DYLAN

MIKE
Dylan Can you hear me Where are
you

MADDIE

Mike shall we stop for a bit

MIKE
What Why We need to find Dylan
we cant do that if we stop

MADDIE
But Mike its nice and quiet

open airwouldnt it be fun

MADDIE runs her hands over MIKEs chest and then over his
shoulders and round his neck She leans forwards to kiss
him MIKE pushes her away

MIKE
Maddie What you doing

MADDIE looks annoyed and disappointed

MADDIE
But I just thought you know
while we were alone

MIKE steps away from her

MIKE
We have to find Dylan or have you
forgotten about him

MADDIE
Of course I havent forgot about
him Come on Mike an extra half
hour isnt gonna make much
difference
MIKE
You are unbelievable For all we
know Dylan might be lying injured
somewhere He was right you know
princess Maddie who only cares
about herself

MADDIE
What are you talking about Thats
not true

MIKE

Oh forget it were meant to be
looking for Dylan the quicker we
find him the quicker we can get
back to camp

MIKE walks off

MADDIE
WaitI cant go that fast

MIKE looks round at MADDIE trying to make her way through
the undergrowth

MIKE
Oh my god I forgot about the
shoes

Once again we see that MADDIE is wearing her heels

Something is in the forest watching everything that

transpires between MADDIE and MIKE It peers round the trees
looking at everything intently We can hear heavy breathing

As MIKE and MADDIE move on the creature follows them
quietly

EXT FOREST SAME TIME

In another part of the forest CARLY and BRAD seem to be
lost

CARLY
Brad do you actually know where
we are or where were going

BRAD
Havent a clue Do you

CARLY
Ermno thats why I was asking
you

They both turn to look at each other
BRAD
Come on lets try this way

BRAD leads the way through the trees Suddenly they hear
something coming crashing through the trees in front of
them CARLY grabs BRADs arm

CARLY
Whats that

BRAD
Shhhh

All of a sudden DYLAN crashes through the trees hes
looking behind him and doesnt see CARLY and BRAD until its

too late

He half staggers half runs straight into CARLY

They both let out a scream

BRAD
Whatthe

BRAD suddenly realises that its DYLAN

BRAD

DYLAN keeps looking over his shoulder

DYLAN

BRAD points in the direction theyve come from DYLAN starts
to limp that way as fast as he can BRAD and CARLY look at
each other Both look concerned about DYLAN but they dont
say anything They go and catch him up and they all head
back to camp

EXT CAMP MIDDAYEARLY AFTERNOON

MIKE and MADDIE come through the trees to the camp They are
both silent and they both look annoyed

MADDIE
Wheres the water

MIKE
In the stream where do you think

MADDIE glares at MIKE and gives a big sigh She goes over to
the water bottle thats in front of MIKEs tent Before she
gets there MIKE grabs the bottle and quickly drinks the
water

MADDIE
Mike

MIKE looks at MADDIE slyly

MIKE
told you the waters in the
stream

MADDIE snatches the water bottle off MIKE and walks off in
the direction of the stream

A few minutes later BRAD CARLY and DYLAN come into camp
DYLAN still looks very frightened and is constantly looking
over his shoulder MIKE looks up as he hears them approach

MIKE
Dylan where you been

DYLAN just pushes past MIKE and goes towards his tent

MIKE
Whats up mate

Silence from DYLAN MIKE turns to CARLY and BRAD

MIKE
Whats going on Is he ok

BRAD shrugs his shoulders

BRAD
I dunno hes been talking like
hes crazy or something hes just
not making any sense

CARLY makes her way over to DYLAN whos walking round his
tent whilst rubbing his hands together nervously His eyes
are still wide with fear CARLY gently puts her hand on
DYLANs arm he jumps and spins around to face her

DYLAN

Oh its you Are you crazy Why

CARLY

Dylan calm down I didnt creep

DYLAN

Oh there is and its watching us

CARLY
Its just your imagination Let me

DYLAN
Sod my foot Thats the least of

CARLY looks round at BRAD and MIKE with a look of despair on
her face

MIKE

foot and you can tell us all
about whatever it is you think

DYLAN
I dont think I know Its out

MIKE

DYLAN and MIKE stand in silence for a moment while holding
eye contact with each other DYLAN starts to limp over to
the log and the remnants of the camp fire

DYLAN
Ok but then we all have to get
outta here

MIKE
Just tell us ok

DYLAN flops down in the log and lets out a sigh The other
come to join him as he starts to relay the details of what
he saw the night before

EXT STREAM AFTERNOON

MADDIE is at the stream Shes still really cross at MIKEs
behaviour and is muttering away to herself She starts to
fill up the water bottle She hears the sound of footsteps
approaching behind her

MADDIE
Youd better of come to apologise

Silence

MADDIE
Im waiting

Sound of heavy breathing

MADDIE
What Now youre interested

MADDIE goes to turn around as something grabs her She
attempts to scream but cant get any air as theres a claw
like hand around her throat The creature starts to drag
MADDIE backwards towards the trees as she drifts into
unconsciousness MADDIEs legs are seen disappearing into
the undergrowth

EXT CAMP AFTERNOON

Back at the camp DYLAN is finishing off telling his friends
everything

DYLAN
Its still out there

MIKE
How much had you drunk before all
this by the way

DYLAN looks annoyed

DYLAN
Are you trying to say I was
drunk

BRAD
Well it does seem a little far
fetched

CARLY

What do you think it was

MIKE
Carly are you serious You dont
believe him surely

DYLAN throws his hands in the air in exasperation

DYLAN
It was real

BRAD looks around

BRAD
Wheres Maddie

At that moment

CARLY runs over to her and puts her arms around her

CARLY
Thats a point Ive not seen her

MIKE
Ah shes fine she dragged her
moody ass down to the stream for
water

BRAD
She moaning again

MIKE

MADDIE just shrugs and walks away from her

MIKE
Someones quiet

MADDIE just looks at him and smiles seductively

CARLY

DYLAN

DYLAN gets up and limps over to his tent and starts to
quickly pack his stuff away MIKE walks over to him

safer for us all to stay together

DYLAN
Yeah I agree but we need to stay

the dark

DYLAN grabs his bag

find his way out of the forest He hears the sound of a
branch snapping behind him

DYLAN

Silence

DYLAN looks around hes not sure where to go everything
looks the same He hears another noise behind him He
panicks and breaks into a run but his foot is still sore
and it prevents him from going very fast He trips over some
fallen branches and falls to the floor He can hear the
sound of heavy breathing now He quickly tries to scramble
to his feet A bit further on he falls again Hes sat on
the ground trying to work out which direction the sounds are
coming from Suddenly a hairy claw grabs his foot DYLAN
screams and franctically tries to pull his leg away He
cant get free of the creatures grip as it starts to drag
him deeper into the trees DYLAN tries to grab hold of
anything he can but the creature is just too strong

After its dragged DYLAN a few feet it lets go of him DYLAN
sits up and tries to see in the darkness As he turns to get
to his feet he comes face to face with the werewolf DYLAN
lets out a blood curdling scream

side of her head MADDIE releases her grip on his throat as
she lets out a loud yelp MIKE scrambles to his feet and
runs MADDIE tries to grab him and scrapes her claws down
his back MIKE doesnt slow down though or turn back he
just runs

As the sun rises in the sky MIKE stumbles out into the
road Hes exhausted and collapses at the side of the road
He thinks hes safe

Something moves in the bushes on the other side of the road
MIKE doesnt notice it

The wolf watches MIKE intently
