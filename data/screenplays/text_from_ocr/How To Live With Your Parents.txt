(FROM CLOSET) The dog’s not the
only one

JULIAN

Polly come on It’s just a puppy
How To Live 27

POLLY
(FROM CLOSET) An unsanctioned
puppy I am integral to the puppy-
buying decision making process
This is a terrible violation of my
parental authority as the best
single working mom in the

Polly bumps into a shelf causing a bunch of HATS to fall on
her Just then Natalie looks out the window

NATALIE

JULIAN
No I haven’t

MAX
Maybe But it’s totally irresponsible
to use a brick as a brake

JULIAN

I think tonight proves it’s way
more irresponsible not to use one
Don’t make things worse Dad

MAX
I’m not your dad And maybe it’s
not my place to say but I don’t
think it’s healthy you’re around
Polly so much

JULIAN
I’ve been setting up her phone
which takes time

MAX
Does it Or are you purposefully
breaking it to have an excuse to
come over

JULIAN

MAX
Not consciously I didn’t say
consciously

JULIAN
Dude that is so uncool

MAX
Youre divorced Get out there
Screw a college girl Screw a
bunch of them Do you know how
lucky you are to have two working
balls Don’t squander them

JULIAN
I’m not squandering my balls

MAX
Then why won’t you let Polly go

JULIAN

Natalie ‘cause I wasn’t before

Max realizes this is a big admission for Julian

MAX
I’m sorry if that sounded harsh I’m
just trying to take care of them

date home after my ex-husband
totalled his car

ELAINE
Im not judging it like you are

POLLY
I can’t believe you told Natalie I
was getting a boyfriend

ELAINE
I didn’t I said if she did it
could be fantastic

POLLY

inevitable a good idea You want
her to live in some fantasy world
That’s how people go schizophrenic

POLLY
She can’t “go” schizophrenic It’s
not covered by my health insurance
(THEN) Look I want you to be an
accent in her life like oregano in
marinara sauce There’s a reason
there’s no such thing as oregano
sauce Because it’s crazy

ELAINE
I’m not an accent I’m an entree

POLLY
You need to pull it back you You
need to act like other people are
watching

ELAINE
I want them to watch Everybody
knows that about me (THEN) What
is this really about

POLLY
I’m scared Natalie will turn out
like me okay I’m a divorced
woman living with her parents who
sells popcorn There are so many
choices I make every day that could
screw Natalie up and I won’t know
which one was bad until she’s grown
up and mad at me

ELAINE
Not even then Look you are
fantastic You’re a great mother
youre very thin you’re the best
thing I ever did and I once had
sex with a Chicago Bull I won’t
say which one because I
don’t remember

dogs now she’s just making me
look bad
