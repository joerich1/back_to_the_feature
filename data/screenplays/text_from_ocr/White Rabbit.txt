TEASER

And as tradition now dictates we PUSH THROUGH the “0” of the
LOST logo We hear HEAVY BREATHING - PANIC - And SLAM INTO --

EXT SCHOOLYARD - DAY - FLASHBACK 1

AN EYE STARING AHEAD INTENSELY And as we PULL OUT we
discover an OPEN CUT just above it And this eye belongs to -

OUR BOY Dark hair Twelve years old Good looking And
as we PULL UP we see he’s on his back -- lying on what looks
like BLACKTOP PAVEMENT A SCHOOLYARD We ain’t on the
island that’s for sure

And right now a BIG KID -- fourteen and a real MEATHEAD --
stands over OUR BOY wielding a clenched fist --

MEATHEAD
Stay down

OUR BOY looks past Meathead SEES --

ANOTHER GOON pounding on a smaller KID The kid desperately
locks eyes with Our Boy between punches -- Help me OUR BOY
grits his teeth starts to get up but --

Meathead gets RIGHT in his face (he’s head taller) --

MEATHEAD
Your choice man -- Walk away now
you won’t get your ass kicked

And the FIGHT behind Meathead is intensifying the other kid
just getting PUMMELLED

The dilemma is clearly etched across OUR BOY’S face -- He
knows what will happen if he helps his friend -- Knows he
doesn’t stand a chance Yeah he COULD walk away

But he doesn’t PUSHES past Meathead -- but the kid is too
big and he grabs Our Boy by the arm and YANKS him back --

And as Meathead shakes his head cocking his FIST back to
literally knock Our Boy’s head CLEAN FUCKING OFF he leaves
us with a final piece of wisdom --

MEATHEAD
Shoulda stayed down Jack

(CONTD) 1

And with the swift CRUNCH of contact --

CUT TO BLACK
AND IN THAT BLACKNESS 2
we hear a familiar BRITISH VOICE shouting excitedly --

CHARLIE (0S)
Jack Jack HEY JACK

EXT BEACH - DAWN (DAY 6) 3

JACK snaps out of a DAZE -- maybe half asleep Finds himself
sitting on the beach And right now CHARLIE is running
towards him FULL TILT --

CHARLIE
You’ve gotta -- someone’s out
there The current Someone’s --

Jack gets to his feet as DISORIENTED as we are --
JACK CHARLIE

What
-- Someone’s out there

And Jack is instantly ALERT Because Charlie is gesturing
towards the OCEAN --

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I woke up -- I don’t swim and

But Jack is already SCANNING the water in the dawn light
And GODDAMMIT

There IS someone out there Really fucking FAR OUT THERE
We can JUST make out an ARM frantically waving for help as

ADRENALINE KICKS IN INSTINCT TAKES OVER And Jack is
PULLING OFF HIS SHIRT as he sprints for the water and he

DIVES IN And we go with him into --

THE OCEAN
As Jack’s arms CUT through the water -- his face emerging
every ten strokes to take a GAPING BREATH -- a fucking

machine as he POWERS towards --

THE PERSON OFF IN THE DISTANCE -- struggling to keep their
head above water -- still so FAR AWAY --
LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404

(CONTD) 3
And we’re MOVING TIGHTER on Jack with every stroke -- his
purpose SINGULAR -- and he’s closing that distance but --

The victim DISAPPEARS under the surface of the water

And we’re WITH JACK in the ten seconds it takes to get to the
spot where they went under -- he takes a DEEP BREATH and
DIVES underneath the surface after them --

And we wait And WAIT

Waves Ocean NO ONE Then -- Jack emerges GASPING for
air But ALONE Takes another RAGGED BREATH as he --

DIVES UNDER AGAIN And this time we sit on the surface even
longer BEAT ANOTHER BEAT How can ANYONE hold their
breath this long And just when we’re counting Jack out --

He EXPLODES to the surface And this time he’s got someone
with him We recognize the victim instantly --

It’s BOONE COUGHING up water GASPING for air But ALIVE

JACK
Deep breaths -- c’mon man -- relax
-- you’re okay -- deep breaths

And as Jack wraps him into a CROSS-CHEST CARRY and begins to
swim back to shore we’re CLOSE ON BOONE Completely SPENT
But his lips are moving -- trying to SAY something Too
weak But he WILLS HIMSELF to do it And finally --

BOONE
Did you get her

JACK
What

BOONE
The woman out there I was
trying to
(focused)
Did you get her

WHAT And Jack instantly turns back away from the shore
THREADS WATER with one arm holds Boone afloat with the other

JACK’S POV - PANICKED HANDHELD Scanning the ocean from
side to side -- How could he not seen

And OH FUCKING SHIT Because there -- ANOTHER hundred yards
out -- IS A WOMAN And she is about to go UNDER

LOST White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 3

BOONE JACK
You have to get her -- -- No -- Current’s too strong
-- You won’t make it back

BOONE
LEAVE ME

Here’s Boone Exhausted A sack of rocks in Jack’s arm

And there’s the WOMAN About to dip below the surface And
so far away we can’t even make out her face

So it’s Sophie’s fucking choice here folks And we --
SMASH CUT TO
THE BEACH 4

As Jack heroically PULLS Boone out of the shallows and to the

safety of the beach

Some of the OTHERS (MICHAEL WALT SUN HURLEY) here now --
CHARLIE and KATE splash into the water wrapping their arms
around Boone --

And as soon as they relieve Jack of the burden he is already
turning back towards the ocean --

KATE
Jack

JACK
There’s someone else out there

A MOMENT Jack was spent before he swam out to get Boone and
back But he’s going to go back in He’s GOT to go back in

And Kate knows it

And time resumes as Jack DIVES back in -- Arms legs heart
mind all furiously dedicated to saving that woman

But we stay HERE And we’re already PULLING BACK and UP
OVER the gathered crowd at the shallows so all we see is --

JACK Swimming out into the ocean A single figure cutting
through an endless expanse of BLUE And he can swim forever
but it’s painfully obvious to us

There’s no one left to save

END OF TEASER

ACT ONE
EXT BEACH - DAY 5

We start CLOSE ON BOONE -- His blue eyes UNBLINKING as they
stare out towards the ocean PULL BACK to find --

He’s still shirtless Barefoot And the intensity in his
eyes If we had to guess at what he’s feeling right now
we’d have to go with ANGER No sense of how long he’s been
sitting here

But it’s been awhile

And now Boone’s gaze floats elsewhere on the beach Off in
the distance Onto JACK Walking towards the INFIRMARY
TENT inexplicably carrying a full length MIRROR

And now we leave Boone to join him as --
DOWN THE BEACH 6

KATE moves to catch up with Jack concern in her eyes
Because now that we’re closer we can clearly see --

Jack has seen better days UNSHAVEN EXHAUSTED And
because he is who he is beating himself up for the life he
didnt save

KATE
Hey --
JACK
So whatd they say
KATE
(sensitively)
Jack maybe you should
JACK

Who was she

A beat Okay He wants to know NEEDS to know Then --

KATE

Her name was Joanna She wasn’t
supposed to be on the plane

(beat)
She went scuba diving off the
Barrier reef and got an ear
infection Doctor grounded her two
days so she bumped her flight
Ended up with us

(CONTD) 6

Jack shakes his head Hard to stomach the brutal irony --

JACK
She was swimming this morning
Just swimming Riptide caught her
(beat)
We’ve been here six days and we
never talked I never said a word
to her There were --

KATE JACK
Jack Don’t -- forty seven of us I
didn’t say a single word

And Kate is not a big believer in feeling sorry for oneself --

KATE
You tried

Jack finally stops walking Puts the MIRROR down Turns to
look at Kate for the first time --

JACK

No I didn’t I thought maybe I
could I thought I could bring
him back and still have time I
was there -- in the water

(beat)
I didn’t try I decided not to go
after her

Kate doesn’t know what to say to that And that’s when it
happens --

Jack goes WHITE

KATE
What’s

But Jack isn’t looking at her He’s looking PAST her WAY
past her And the SOUND DROPS OUT as we follow his gaze to --

THE OCEAN There In the shallows A MAN
And we’re TOO FAR AWAY to see his face but he’s wearing a
SUIT And he’s WAIST DEEP in the water Just standing

there Facing us Facing Jack

And it’s fucking CREEPY

KATE (0S)
Jack

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 6

SOUND rushes IN -- Jack’s attention is drawn back to Kate

KATE
Are you okay

But Jack is already looking back towards the ocean MOVING
TOWARDS IT in fact But --

There’s no one there

JACK
You see that

KATE
(confused)
See what

JACK
He was just standing there in
the water A man

Jack turns back to her DESPERATE Needing her to tell him
he’s not going fucking nuts Needing her to tell him she saw
the same thing he did

KATE
Jack

And her face says it all Jack is visibly distraught --

JACK
You didn’t see him

KATE
(tenderly)
When’s the last time you slept

But Jack isn’t in the mood for tenderness right now And he
sure as shit isn’t answering that question either He just
picks up the MIRROR

JACK
I have to put this with the rest of
the gear

And with that Jack walks off And as KATE watches him go
we begin to drift --

AROUND THE BEACH 7

And there’s a new feeling here amongst the castaways today
One of LOSS They’ve all heard about the woman who drowned --
LOST White Rabbit (PINK) 8904 8
(CONTD) 7
But none of them are actually TALKING ABOUT IT We FIND --
MICHAEL
Still a little GIMPY from his run-in with the boar He
stands barefoot on the beach BRUSHING HIS TEETH WALT
stands next to his father doing the same
Michael holds a cup of OCEAN WATER in a coffee mug Brings
it to his lips Sloshes it around his mouth SPITS
Refills the mug Hands it to Walt

MICHAEL
Don’t swallow it okay

WALT
Why not
MICHAEL
‘Cause it’s from the ocean It’1l

make you thirsty

WALT
Why

Michael is not up for the “constant barrage of questions”
thing Especially today

MICHAEL
Just don’t swallow it man

Walt knows when to push and when not to So he takes the
cup Rinses And SPITS

And we PULL BACK to see Michael and Walt from afar SOMEONE
watching them And it’s --

SUN 8
She watches Michael and Walt from the TREE LINE
Sun is snapped out of her quiet observance as --

A FINGER reaches into frame gently touches her CHAPPED LIPS
Sun jumps -- immediately looks at --

JIN He speaks softly (but not altogether kindly) in KOREAN
As they’re alone we get the benefit of SUBTITLES --

JIN
You need water
LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404 9
(CONTD) 8

SUN
No -- Im all right Thank you

He settles down next to her

And they sit in SILENCE for a few beats And we can see the
death of the woman even though a stranger it WEIGHS on
them too And finally it is SUN who speaks --

SUN
When will someone tell us what to
do

JIN
(surprised)
What

SUN
I dont think anyone is coming

JIN
(not so sure)
Someone will come

Sun shakes her head Unable to challenge what she clearly
knows is her husband’s DENIAL --

SUN
The others they ignore us If
we tried harder to communicate

JIN
Well be fine We dont need them

And then in an attempt to be reassuring --

JIN
I will tell you what to do

And if Sun were actually looking into her husbands eyes
right now she might see the same thing we do --

Doubt But for now we’re MOVING ON AS --

A LONG PAIR OF STUNNING LEGS 9
Tromp by Sun and Jin dainty plastic SUNFLOWERS adorning a pair
of PINK FLOP-FLOPS as the feet within them stride with great

purpose towards --

A PAIR OF FANTASTICALLY CRAFTED COWBOY BOOTS Toes in the
air One tapping to a tune no one can hear but its wearer
LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404 10
(CONTD) 9

The Flip-Flops stop Square off against the boots A tense
beat Then --

SHANNON (0S)
Have you got it or what

And we PAN UP to reveal the Flip-Flops belong to SHANNON
The boots of course are on --

SAWYER
You’re in my light sticks

SAWYER sits on a MAKESHIFT DECK CHAIR Doesnt even look up
as he reads a battered paperback -- “WATERSHIP DOWN”

SHANNON
“Lightsticks” What the hell is
that supposed to --

SAWYER
Light Comma Sticks Meaning
your legs

He turns a page This is a different side of Sawyer Less
directly adversarial with Shannon HMMMM

SAWYER
How’s your brother

SHANNON SAWYER

What do you mean how --
-- Almost drowned didn’t he

SHANNON
(fuck you)
Look -- while I really love my new
nickname and I think it’s really
sweet that you’re asking

SAWYER
Calm down I got your damn stuff

And with that Sawyer produces a can of BUG SPRAY from the
canvas bag at his feet as Shannon SCRATCHES her leg --

SHANNON
(skeptical)
It’ll keep off sand fleas

SAWYER
You bet And it’s got aloe too

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404

(CONTD) SHANNON
How much

SAWYER SHANNON
You serious
-- Yeah I’m

And Sawyer finally puts his book down Looks at Shannon like

she just might be the stupidest person in the world

SAWYER
You in the same situation I am
‘Cause last I checked we weren’t
going nowhere for awhile
(slowly and clearly)
Your money’s no good here

SHANNON
So what the hell do you want
(then dawning on her)
If you think that I’m

SAWYER
Five grand

The effectively shuts her up After a beat --

SHANNON
I thought you said money was no
good here

SAWYER
I was negotiating
(grins)
I’‘ll take an IOU Somethin’ tells
me you’re good for it

Shannon just looks at him Scratches her leg but it
almost becomes a DEFIANT SCRATCH Then she straightens
Gives him the full on EVILEST EYE EVER --

SHANNON
Screw you

And with that she STALKS OFF Sawyer watches her go
the bug spray back into his bag

And goes back to his book

HER BALANCE -- Kate immediately jumps up steadying her --
KATE
Whoa -- You okay

Claire shakes it off

CLAIRE

Oh And I’m pregnant

KATE

CLAIRE

KATE

CLAIRE

KATE

LOST White Rabbit (BLUE ) 8604

Claire laughs Sits down Claire’s eyes light up as she
spots a SUN HAT puts it on --

CLAIRE
Can I ask you something Don’t
mean to get personal but I’m
curious

KATE
(stiffens then)
Sure Shoot

CLAIRE
Are you a Gemini

KATE
(surprised)

CLAIRE

Thought so Restless Passionate
Everyone thinks Astrology is a load
of crap but that’s because they
don’t understand it I could do
your chart if youd like

(Kate wouldnt like)
Ah All right then

(shakes her head sighs)
Geminis

Kate smiles at her Claire smiles back A genuine bond
between them And off this lovely moment we move BACK TO --

EXT MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY AREA - DAY 11
JACK Still working Always working Eyes bloodshot

Next to the tent Jack has managed to drag a CARGO CONTAINER
to store valuable GEAR Right now he’s placing the MIRROR
next to a stack of what seem to be TEXTBOOKS as --

HURLEY (0S)
Hey Jack

Jack looks up to see HURLEY --

HURLEY
Whoa -- You look tired brother

JACK
I’m fine What’s up

HURLEY

SMASH CUT TO

EXT BEACH - WATER COLLECTION SITE - DAY 12

CLOSE ON JACK His eyes telling us that somehow his day
actually just go WORSE --

JACK
That’s it

CHARLIE (0S)
That’s it

And we PULL OUT to find --

Jack stands with CHARLIE AND HURLEY Next to them one of
the RAIN STATIONS -- a jury-rigged TARP meant to collect
water But right now all their attention is on --

A RED SUITCASE Inside it carefully arranged BOTTLES OF
WATER Some bear the OCEANIC LABEL All about three
quarters full

JACK
How many

CHARLIE
Eighteen

HURLEY

People just took what they needed
‘cause y’know we were supposed to
be rescued But uh -- we weren’t
And it hasn’t rained man

CHARLIE
Even if we divvied it up split
the bottles in half it wouldn’t be
enough water for all forty-seven

JACK
Forty-six
(beat)
There’s forty-six now

A quiet moment as they all absorb the implication Then --

HURLEY
It’s getting pretty toasty out
here When people find out this is
it they’re gonna freak out man
LOST “White Rabbit (BLUE)
12 (CONTD)

CHARLIE
And the boar’s running low until we
can catch another one What should
we tell them

8604

14a

LOST White Rabbit (PINK) 8904
(CONTD) 12

And they’re looking to Jack for these answers And we can
FEEL his pain The enormous load he’s bearing The enormous
load the others PUT ON HIM --

JACK
I don’t know
HURLEY CHARLIE
Maybe we can make one of
those water-finding sticks -- Where should we put what

weve got

JACK
I don’t know

And Jack is WALKING AWAY now it’s just TOO FUCKING MUCH

But Charlie picks up the RED SUITCASE He and Hurley nipping
at Jack’s heels as he heads back for the infirmary tent --

CHARLIE HURLEY
We should put it in the tent
yeah -- Maybe that dog can find
water
CHARLIE HURLEY
Probably better if no one
knows how little is left -- Dogs can find pot and
bombs so they can find
water

They arrive at the infirmary tent and Charlie places the
suitcase of water just inside the flap

CHARLIE
(to Jack)
If you tell the others were
running low we can ration it
That way you can decide who gets

And that does it The dam breaks Jack stops SPINS ON
BOTH OF THEM -- And he doesn’t YELL but it’s fucking close --

JACK
I’m not deciding anything

And Hurley visibly flinches Not used to this from Jack
Shit Neither are we

HURLEY
(quietly)
Why not

LOST White Rabbit (PINK) 8904 15A
12 (CONTD) 12

Jack GRITS his teeth Why not Why fucking not

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 12

Whatever the answer to that is he ain’t giving it to them
So he turns And WALKS AWAY

And we stay with Jack as he leaves Charlie and Hurley in his
wake Moving closer CLOSER And finally we’re right on
his BLOODSHOT EYES as --

INT JACK’S PARENTS’ HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK 13

CLOSE ON THAT SAME PAIR OF EYES -- but twenty years younger
And one of them is almost SWOLLEN SHUT

TWELVE YEAR OLD JACK stands nervously in the doorway of an
imposing STUDY Beautiful Ornate The kind of place where
you don’t want to touch stuff Jack currently focused on --

A WELL-WORN LEATHER CHAIR Its back facing us But
someone’s in it -- A MASCULINE HAND reaches to the small end
table next to the chair picks up a GLASS OF SCOTCH

CLINKS the ice cubes as he gently rotates his wrist And
finally --

A FACE peers from around the chair Extremely handsome
Very intense INTELLIGENCE dances behind his eyes

This is DR SHEPHARD This is JACK’S FATHER

SHEPHARD
Not the best decision huh kiddo

Shephard offers a smile to his son -- but it’s only with his
mouth not his EYES

SHEPHARD
You wanna come in

Not really But Jack does anyway Walks up to his dad’s
chair Of course there’s no place for him to sit

SHEPHARD
So how’s the other guy look

Jack doesn’t get the joke His father sighs --

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Want to tell me what happened

JACK
(shrugs )
Couple guys jumped Marc Silverman

LOST White Rabbit (BLUE ) 8604
(CONTD) 13

SHEPHARD
Couple guys jumped Marc Silverman
(beat)
But they didn’t jump you

JACK
No

Shephard just looks at his son for a moment Can’t quite
read it but it feels a lot like PITY Then --

He extends his FISTS Face down

SHEPHARD
Okay Jack One’s got a quarter in
it Other’s empty You choose
right quarter’s yours You choose
wrong you give me a quarter

Jack just looks at his father’s outstretched hands for a
moment Not sure what’s going on right now

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Decide Jack

Jack deliberates another moment Finally --

Picks the left hand Shephard opens it up -- NOTHING inside

Shakes his head --

SHEPHARD (CONT’D)
Pay up

Is he serious Yeah He is

Jack reaches into his own pocket hands his father a QUARTER

The old man takes it looking over his son’s beaten face
Downs a swallow of his drink --

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Your heart’s in the right place
Sticking up for the little guy
(beat)
But look what happened You made
the wrong call You lost buddy
(beat)
You failed

And let’s stop for a second here Because this is one of
those moments in your childhood One of those moments where
your folks say something that just NEVER GOES AWAY

ee

LOST White Rabbit (BLUE)
(CONTD) Something that sticks with you That BECOMES you

is listening to every fucking word of it

SHEPHARD (CONTD)

Boy was on my table today Year
younger than you maybe Bad
heart And it was a real rough
one Jack Got real hairy real
fast People were looking to me to
make decisions Big decisions
What to do How to do it

(beat)
And I was able to make those
decisions because at the end of the
day after that boy died I was able
to wash my hands come home to
dinner watch Carol Burnett and
laugh until my sides hurt And how
can I do that Even when I fail --
How do I do that

(beat)
Because I have what it takes

8604

And his father actually puts his hand on Jack’s shoulder
does love his son This is said out of that love no

matter how fucking cruel is sounds to us --

SHEPHARD

Don’t choose Jack Don’t decide
Walk away from the fights Because
when you fail -- when you make the
wrong choice It’s gonna hurt
And buddy When that hurt comes

(beat)
You don’t have what it takes

Jack absorbs that And more importantly because this is
father Because he is twelve Because this must be true --

He BELIEVES it

A beat And then his father again extends two fists --

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Same rules Double or nothing
Decide

And Jack

He

his

But Jack just looks at the extended hands Many many many

beats pass before Jack finally shakes his head

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Good boy

No

Fe

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 13

And OFF YOUNG JACK the lesson not only learned but HARD-
WIRED WE COME BACK TO--

INTEXT INFIRMARY TENT - DAY 14

Those same intense eyes UNBLINKING

Jack sits alone in the INFIRMARY TENT AND what’s he staring
at

The OPEN RED SUITCASE that Charlie placed on the floor -- THE
EIGHTEEN BOTTLES OF WATER

And as if that wasn’t enough to worry about here’s -

BOONE (0S)
Why didn’t you leave me

Jack looks up to see BOONE standing in the opening of the
tent We get the feeling he’s been working his way up to
this confrontation all morning

And this is the last fucking thing Jack needs He gets up
exits the tent --

JACK
Not now man

BOONE
I could have made it back
(Jack ignores him)
What You’re not gonna answer me
I told you to leave me man I
told you I could’ve

JACK
You were drowning

And Boone can’t argue that So --

BOONE
You shouldve saved her

Jack stands Gets in real close to Boone Something about
his eyes -- something FRAYED But what he says he says
quite SIMPLY --

JACK
But I didn’t save her
(beat)
And neither did you

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 14

And with that Jack pushes past him and out to --
THE BEACH 15

Boone isn’t gonna be blown off Stays with Jack as he moves
across the beach --

BOONE
You think you’re all noble and
heroic coming after me I was
fine You’re not the only one
around here who knows what to do
man I run a business Who
appointed you savior What gives
you the right to

And although Boone continues his rant his voice begins to
fall away Because Jack isn’t looking at Boone anymore

He’s looking over Boone’s shoulder Because there’s
something there No -- SOMEONE

OFF IN THE DISTANCE 16
There on the TREE LINE Where beach meets jungle

The MAN IN THE SUIT and he’s wearing WHITE TENNIS SHOES

Too far away to discern the figure’s identity Just standing
there

AND WERE BACK WITH JACK 17

Because he’s not taking his eyes off the man this time He’s
already walking away from Boone --

BOONE
(shouts after him)

Hey -- Don’t you walk away from me

Where the hell are you going HEY
But Jack is BREAKING INTO A RUN Eyes locked --
ON THE TREE LINE 18
Where the SUITED MAN turns around heads INTO THE JUNGLE
AND JACK 19

RUNS Stumbles in the sand -- but immediately regains his
footing SINGLE PURPOSE DESPERATE

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404 21
(CONTD) 19

And we follow Jack ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BEACH until he
EXT BEACH - TREE LINE - DAY 20
BURSTS through the tree line The sun immediately obscured
by the JUNGLE CANOPY And Jack comes to an ABRUPT STOP

because --

The Man In The Suit is ten yards away

Just standing still His back to Jack Close enough to make
out his GRAY HAIR And it’s HAND-HELD CREEPY Jack takes
a few tentative steps forward Closing the distance

Jack reaches out to touch his shoulder And the Man
SUDDENLY TURNS

It’s Jack’s father

SHEPHARD Twenty years older But here On the island
And the SHOCK of this -- the fact that he’s actually SEEING
this -- FLOORS Jack His eyes go WIDE as he literally
staggers backwards TRIPS --
And lands on his ass
His eyes never leave the fact of his father SO FUCKING MUCH
GOING ON -- but it’s almost like Jack has regressed twenty-
five years His voice almost childlike as he utters --
JACK

Dad

And they LOCK EYES

But Shephard gives Jack nothing He just turns around And
heads DEEPER INTO THE JUNGLE

END OF ACT ONE

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404 22

ACT TWO
EXT BEACH - TREE LINE - DAY 21

JACK is exactly where we left him Here where the jungle
meets the beach

And he’s just BREATHING Fast ADRENALINE still pumping
with the weight of what he just saw Or what he THINKS he
just saw
And as we begin to CLOSE IN on Jack we realize he’s not just
breathing -- he’s WHISPERING something Over and over and
over again
And now we’re TIGHT enough to hear it --
JACK
(whispers )
Gone he’s gone hes gone

And as we begin to HEAR THE PATTER OF RAIN ON GLASS
INT JACK’S PARENTS’ HOME - STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 22

MARGO (0S)
He’s gone Jack

And we find JACK’S REFLECTION in a window begin pummelled by
RAIN The Jack we know and love Same age as he is on the
island and surprisingly equally as RUN DOWN

JACK
He’1l be back

And Jack turns away from the window to face --

MARGO His MOTHER Late fifties A crisply put together
woman All Blue blood STOIC

MARGO

This time it’s different

Both stand in HIS FATHER’S STUDY Not as imposing as it was
when Jack was boy -- But THE EMPTY LEATHER CHAIR is a
constant presence in every shot

Jack looks over a mantle of PHOTOGRAPHS -- All of SHEPHARD
Catching a fish receiving an award giving a speech Jack
reaches to pick one up --

MARGO
Please don’t touch that
LOST White Rabbit (BLUE ) 8604 23
22 (CONTD) 22

But Jack picks it up anyway Maybe DEFIANTLY

JACK
Ever notice there aren’t any
pictures of me in here Or you

MARGO

(simply)
It’s his study

JACK
Yeah

Jack puts the photo back Just the sound of the RAIN for a
few beats Then --

MARGO
I want you to bring him back

JACK MARGO
(shaking his head)
That’s good Yeah Me
-- What

JACK
He hasn’t talked to me in two
months man

MARGO JACK
You haven’t talk to him in
two months -- He doesn’t want me to
bring him back Trust me
Let one of his “friends”

MARGO
He doesn’t have friends anymore
(beat pointed)

Why do you think that is
Okay Starting to heat up a little here We’re definitely
dropping in on some big time FAMILY SHIT -- and we don’t need
to know exactly what it is to get the main idea -- WHATEVER

MADE HIS FATHER RUN OFF JACK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT

Jack’s eyes drop under his mother’s GLARE Whatever it is
she’s accusing him of part of him is OWNING IT Then --

MARGO
He was right about you

And that fucking hits a nerve Jack’s eyes dart back up
giving her a GLARE right back --

LOST
(CONTD)

White Rabbit (BLUE ) 8604 22

JACK
Right about what

MARGO
You don’t understand the pressure
he was under You --

JACK
I understand pressure

Beat And Jack’s eyes begin to water He’s TRYING to hold
it together We’re seeing the PAIN here

And damn if Margo doesn’t see it too She actually SOFTENS
Vulnerable --

A moment

MARGO
Please -- You know how he gets He
doesn’t he won’t take care of
himself You have to go after him
(beat)
Please
ON JACK And this is hard from him to say but --

JACK
I’m sorry I can’t

And that vulnerability in Margo It is gone in a SECOND

And whatever she’s talking about -- whatever Jack “did” -- it
gets him A low blow but a TRUE blow So finally --

Beat

MARGO

“TI can’t” You don’t get to say “I
can’t” Not after what you did
Was it hard Betraying your own
father Was that a tough decision
Oh -- but you thought you were
actually helping him didn’t you
But you took it all away you
You ruined him You did this

(as near rage as she gets)
You bring you father home Jack

JACK
Where is he

MARGO

JACK Still on his ass Brought out of his memory by --

VOICES behind him Off in the distance And Jack looks over
his shoulder --

BACK AT THE BEACH

The CASTAWAYS milling around doing their thing CHARLIE
HURLEY BOONE Responsibility

And now Jack turns back towards THE JUNGLE
The way his father went And maybe the path of madness
TIME TO MAKE A DECISION
So Jack gets up
And walks into the jungle

SMASH CUT TO

And we follow them --
INSIDE THE TENT 27

Michael and Charlie gently lay Claire down on the makeshift
BED of SEAT CUSHIONS

CHARLIE
She’s breathing I think

Kate leans over her --
KATE

And THANK FUCKING GOD because Claire’s eyes flutter open
She looks around confused --

CHARLIE

KATE

Charlie madly pulls away various boxes searching the tent
But it’s pretty clear that the suitcase isn’t here Charlie
turns back to Kate

CHARLIE

The water’s gone
(furious confusion)

Someone stole it

28 EXT BEACH - A MINUTE LATER 28

LOCKE
Where’s the doctor

Find Kate talking with LOCKE and SAYID the concern apparent
on their faces clearly filled in on the situation --

KATE
I don’t know No one can find him

SAYID
And this was the last of the camps
water supply

KATE
Yeah

SAYID
Keeping it all in one place
Foolish

KATE SAYID
I can go into the jungle
Maybe find some fresh water -- You’re not going alone --

LOCKE

When the others find out we’re out
of water it’s gonna get ugly And
when they find out someone pinched
it it’s gonna get uglier I’1l
go Camp needs you two here
Especially with the doctor gone
Besides --

(that fucking smile)
I know where to look

And speaking of looking
29 EXT JUNGLE - DAY 29

JACK moves through the jungle

LOST White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 29
This guy is literally COMING APART AT THE SEAMS A man
possessed Clearly in pursuit of something and someone that
couldn’t possibly be here But that’s not stopping him

Again we’re HAND-HELD DISORIENTED No rhyme or reason to
the direction that Jack is heading And he comes to --

A CLEARING SURROUNDED BY DENSE JUNGLE

And Jack STOPS Looks around him Has no idea where he is
And maybe he doesn’t care But we’re starting to SLOWLY SPIN
AROUND HIM -- JACK a man more lost now than ever before

And it starts as a whisper

JACK
Where are you

Spinning FASTER NOW Jack louder --

JACK
Where are you

And we’re getting FUCKING DIZZY we’re SPINNING SO FAST as --

JACK
WHERE ARE YOU

And we SLAM INTO --

INT CORPORATE HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON - FLASHBACK 30

THE COMPLETION OF THAT WILD SPINNING AS WE FINALLY REST ON --

JACK And he’s standing in the middle of a HOTEL ROOM
Crisp Sharp LIFELESS This place is where fancy business
travellers might stay - A complete CONTRAST to the organic
jungle of the island

Jack stares at the KING-SIZED BED - It has not been slept in

HOTEL MANAGER
The maid says he hasn’t used the
bed in the past three days

A YOUNG HOTEL MANAGER stands a few feet behind Jack He
looks uncomfortable A clear AUSTRALIAN ACCENT

Jack wanders around the room Jack picks up a DIRTY BUTTON-
DOWN SHIRT neatly hanging over one of the chairs Runs his
finger over the collar --

LOST White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 30
JACK
He rent a car through your
concierge

HOTEL MANAGER
No sir

Jack puts down the shirt Floats over to the DESK -- A
chaotic ugly representation of his father’s STATE OF MIND

A TORN MAGAZINE MEDICATIONS TICKETS RECEIPTS CIGARETTE
PACKETS Jack PULLS OPEN ONE OF THE DRAWERS --

INSIDE -- THREE mostly empty bottles of SCOTCH Jack
abruptly CLOSES the drawer

HOTEL MANAGER
Quite honestly Mr Shephard I
don’t think he rented a car at all

JACK
Yeah Why’s that

HOTEL MANAGER
There was an incident a few nights
ago Here at the hotel bar I had
to ask Security to escort your
father to his room

Jack turns Maybe a little embarrassed Maybe a little
guilty But definitely a little ANGRY --

JACK
What’s that have to do with renting
a car

HOTEL MANAGER
I’m sorry I shouldnt have

JACK HOTEL MANAGER
C’mon What’s it have to do
with renting a car -- Mr Shephard

The Hotel Manager shakes his hand He takes a BEAT Then --

HOTEL MANAGER
I don’t think any rental agent in
Sydney would lease your father a
car in his condition

Well There it is And Jack does not like hearing it NOT
AT ALL Takes a step towards the Manager --

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 30

JACK
My father
(holding it in but it’s
not fucking easy)
Isa Chief of Surgery

The Hotel Manager quickly realizes he’s crossed the line --

HOTEL MANAGER
Of course sir I apologize

And Jack is so fucking angry he wants to pound this guy but
luckily his attention is diverted as --

He spots something on the NIGHT STAND A WALLET Jack
immediately crosses to it Picks it up Opens it --

Cash Credit Cards Driver’s License HIS FATHER’S

Jack settles down onto the bed -- as if the AIR has been

knocked out of him A few moments pass Then softly --
JACK
He left his wallet Who leaves a
wallet

HOTEL MANAGER
Perhaps you should talk to the
police Mr Shephard

The Manager remains awkwardly in the center of the room but
were MOVING IN ON JACK -- his eyes full of DESPERATION As
he whispers softly to himself --

JACK
Where are you

WE BLAST BACK OUT INTO --

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 31

COMPLETE SILENCE Jack stands frozen in the middle of the
CLEARING where we left him Eerie No insects No birds
NOTHING Just the sound of his own BREATHING

And maybe it’s just that Jack is literally at the end of his
fucking tether but it’s almost like we can FEEL A PRESENCE
here And Jack STOPS breathing because he hears something

THE CLINK OF ICE CUBES INSIDE A GLASS

And it’s fucking CLOSE Jack WHIPS AROUND --

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 31

Nothing there But then the CRACK OF A TWIG snapping brings
his attention back to --

THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE
And Jack can just make out SOMEONE RUNNING THROUGH IT --

The Man in the suit and white tennis shoes HIS FATHER

JACK
Wait

And a new look of DETERMINATION falls over Jack’s eyes
Enough of this bullshit ENOUGH He’s gonna catch him this
time He has to

So Jack cuts through the jungle just catching GLIMPSES of

his father up ahead -- always far off just out of reach

Jack pushes massive LEAVES aside -- and we’re SO CLOSE on him
we lose perspective because Jack RUNS with such drive and

such purpose -- GAINING now about to finally CATCH UP when --
THE GROUND GIVES WAY 32
JACK FALLS FORWARD down an INCLINE -- FALLS ON HIS ASS --
SCRAMBLING -- SLIDING -- Tries to STOP HIMSELF with his feet

but he’s moving too fast and
OH SHIT -- He’s flying off A ROCK SHELF and --

A ROOT is all that saves him as his body goes over and his
LEGS KICK AT AIR because

Jack is hanging off the EDGE OF A CLIFF A hundred foot drop
to the ground Out here ALONE

And as we realize he’s totally FUCKED

END OF ACT TWO

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404 32

ACT THREE
EXT CLIFF FACE - DAY 33
Jack right where we left him --
CLINGING TO THE CLIFF FACE -- his grip slipping

And we wanna milk this Our guy Our hero Literally
facing DEATH and there is NO WAY he can escape it

Jack tries to wedge his foot amongst some rocks but they’re
LOOSE and

THE ROOT he’s holding on to is PULLING FREE and ---

GRIM RECOGNITION falls over Jack’s WATERING EYES He’s going
to die here Here on this fucking island --

And just as the root is about to POP OUT OF THE CLIFF FACE --

VOICE (0S)
Take my hand

And Jack instinctively looks up at the SOUND OF THAT VOICE --
It’s LOCKE

Lying on his belly extending his arm over the EDGE --

And Jack barely registers the relief of seeing him before he

SLAPS his free hand into Locke’s outstretched one just as the
ROOT COMES FREE tumbles down into the abyss as --

Locke GRUNTS pulling Jack up and over the edge to SAFETY

Jack immediately rolls over STARES up at the sky Quick
shallow breaths Borderline HYPERVENTILATION

LOCKE
You okay

Jack just nods Because he’s not hyperventilating at all
He’s LAUGHING Louder now Hysterically

And okay maybe it’s a little insane but this is what
happens when you’ve been in a plane crash and havent slept
and you’re chasing your father through the jungle and you
almost fucking die

And as Locke looks on starting to chuckle himself --

INT INFIRMARY TENT - LATE AFTERNOON 35

We find CLAIRE inside the shade of the infirmary tent She
NAPS not looking too hot PALE

CHARLIE (0S)
Hey

Claire’s eyes flutter open to see CHARLIE settling down next
to her

CLAIRE
(disoriented)
Hey How long have I

CHARLIE
Couple hours Here -- it’s not
much but it’s what we have

Charlie offers her a small THERMOS CUP -- A little liquid
splashes inside Claire takes a grateful SIP --

CLAIRE
I should get up

NO SHE SHOULDN’T because another wave of DIZZINESS falls over
her Charlie immediately SUPPORTS her nurturing instinct --

CHARLIE
You just relax yeah
(smiles)
Got to think about the little one

The dizziness passes as Claire eases back down on the
cushions --

CLAIRE
Thanks for the water

CHARLIE
Yeah A whole swallow
(somewhat darkly)
There’d be more if some git hadn’t
nicked it

CLAIRE
Is Jack back yet

CHARLIE
No No one’s seen him
(seeing her concern)
Don’t worry though -- good ole’ Mr
Locke’s gone into the jungle to get
you some water Should be back
before nightfall

CLAIRE
Great Our only hunter’s gonna get
eaten so that he can get the
pregnant girl some more water

CHARLIE
I wouldn’t worry love
(smiles conspiratorially)
You tell me who’d you rather meet
in a dark alley -- whatever’s out
there or that geezer and his four
hundred knives

Claire actually begins to GIGGLE --

CHARLIE
Seriously Who packs four hundred
knives Personally I only have
room for two hundred Three
hundred the most

The two share a nice LAUGH A real moment -- And then Claire
becomes serious Contemplative --

CLAIRE
When are they going to find us
The rescuers
Beat
CHARLIE
Soon
CLAIRE
(smiles)

Thanks Charlie

CHARLIE
Thanks for what

CLAIRE
People don’t look me in the eye
here I think I scare them The
baby
(searching for the words)
I’m like this time bomb of
responsibility waiting to go off

Charlie considers this Then --

CHARLIE
You don’t scare me

LOST White Rabbit (BLUE) 8604 35A

(CONTD) And off this genuinely sweet MOMENT

EXT BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON 36

A STUNNING SUNSET throws magical light across the camp as
various fires are lit - Night is falling

LOST White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 36
And we pick up SHANNON as she approaches BOONE sitting at
the edge of the ocean That same mix of contemplation and
anger in his eyes

SHANNON
Hey Superman -- still moping

Boone just keeps looking out at the water

SHANNON
Boone

And Shannon actually sheds the bitch persona for a moment
Maybe actually displaying GENUINE CONCERN --

SHANNON
It’s not your fault that

BOONE
Go away Shannon

And when she gets shut down she snaps back into purely
defensive mode PISSED --

SHANNON
Nice talking to you jackass

And Shannon STALKS off passing --

HURLEY A little out of breath Obviously excited about
something We PICK HIM UP as he hurries over to --

KATE AND SAYID They look up expectantly --

HURLEY
The Chinese people have water
EXT BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON 37
CLOSE ON AN EMPTY OCEANIC WATER BOTTLE -- just like the ones

we saw in the RED SUITCASE PULL BACK to find --

SAYID
Where did you get this

Kate and Sayid confront SUN outside her makeshift Lean-To
Sayid is amped --

SAYID KATE
Where Did You --

-- She doesn’t understand
you Sayid

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404

(CONTD)

SAYID
She understands me
(back to Sun)
Did you steal this water

SUN just looks at them nervously speaks softly in KOREAN (no
subtitles here -- not when ENGLISH SPEAKERS are around) --

SUN
This is a misunderstanding

And that’s when JIN arrives Head full of steam --
IMMEDIATELY GETS BETWEEN SAYID AND HIS WIFE -- PROTECTIVE

JIN
Get away from her pig If you
touch my wife
Kate gets into the fray ever the peacemaker --
KATE
Easy Let’s just talk about this
all right
Sayid steps back raises his hands in frustration stares
daggers at JIN Kate holds up the water bottle to Jin
Points to it

KATE
Is this yours

Jin stares at her blankly

KATE
Who gave you this

And “WHO” is a word that Jin does understand because his
immediate (albeit defiant) reaction is to POINT DOWN THE
BEACH Kate and Sayid turn to see --

OFF NEAR THE FUSELAGE

SAWYER Smoking a cigarette

Completely oblivious to the fact that he’s just been picked

out of a lineup

BACK WITH KATE AND SAYID

KATE
Sonofa

44R-LOST White Rabbit (BLUE) 8604 38

(CONTD)
And Kate is set to rip Sawyer’s fucking head off but

Sayid grabs her arm

SAYID

I don’t see the water
KATE

So
SAYID

You go after him now he’ll give

you nothing But if you wait
(beat)

A rat will always lead you to its

hole

And OFF KATE knowing he’s right but not happy about it And
as NIGHT finally falls on the BEACH

EXT JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON 40
MACRO CLOSE ON A SINGLE DROPLET OF WATER suspended on a

BANYAN LEAF And as the leaf tips we watch that DROPLET
slide down its surface and into --

AN OCEANIC BOTTLE 4l

PULL BACK to find the bottle in the hand of Locke It’s
barely a quarter full but that’s what happens when you do it
one drop at a time --

JACK sits on a rock Staring into the jungle And we get
the feeling that Locke has just been letting him sit too
Something we should note about these two -- They can talk
Kindred spirits Mutual respect Finally --

JACK
How are they The others

LOCKE
They’re thirsty Hungry Waiting
to be rescued

(then pointed)
And they need someone to tell them
what to do

Jack stiffens And this is an instinct A FEAR

JACK
Me I can’t --

LOST White Rabbit (BLUE ) 8604
(CONTD) 41

LOCKE
Why can’t you

That’s really the question isn’t it

And maybe Jack has never spoken the words aloud before but
when he does we know he believes them --

JACK
Because I’m not a leader
LOCKE
And yet they all treat you like

one Hm
Jack knows he’s right Hates that he’s right

JACK
I don’t know how to help them
I’ll fail Ill
(then quietly)
I don’t have what it takes

And in this moment -- his father’s words travelling twenty
years to find themselves coming out of his mouth -- we know
that despite his own instinctual heroism Jack BELIEVES this

Locke nods Twists the cap on the bottle as he settles down
across from Jack --

LOCKE

Why are you out here Jack
JACK

I think I’m going crazy
LOCKE

You’re not going crazy
JACK

No
LOCKE

Crazy people don’t know they’re
going crazy They think they’re
getting saner

(smiles again now)
So why are you out here Jack

And something about Locke -- Something HYPNOTIC about the way
his eyes dance makes Jack open up the him --

LOST
(CONTD)

And now we begin to PUSH IN on Locke
what he speaks and what he speaks of is fucking SCARY --

White Rabbit (BLUE)

JACK
I’m chasing something
(beat)
Someone

LOCKE
Ah The White Rabbit
(off Jack’s confusion)
Alice in Wonderland

JACK
Yeah Wonderland Because who I’m
chasing He’s not here

LOCKE
But you see him

JACK
Yes But he’s not here

LOCKE
And if I came to you saying the
same thing what would your
explanation be As a doctor

JACK
(diagnosis mode)
I’d call it a hallucination
Result of dehydration Post
Traumatic Stress Not having slept
more than two hours a night for the
last week All of the above

LOCKE
All right then You’re
hallucinating
(beat)
But what if you’re not

JACK
Then we’re all in a lot of trouble

LOCKE
I’m an ordinary man Jack Meat
and potatoes I live in the real
world Not a big believer in
“magic”

But this place is different
Special The others they don’t

want to talk about it because it
scares them But we all know it
We all feel it Is your white
rabbit a hallucination Probably
(beat here it is)
But what if everything that
happened here happened for a
reason What if that someone
you’re chasing is really here

JACK
That’s impossible
LOCKE

Even if it is let’s say it’s not

And Jack is practically in a trance because part of him
believes exactly THAT Softly --

JACK

Then what happens if I catch him
LOCKE

I don’t know -- But I’ve looked

into the eye of this island And
what I saw

(beat)
It was beautiful

And with that Locke stands up Runs his hands down his
legs maybe to get the dirt off -- or maybe just because he
likes to touch them -- and picks up his pack

JACK
Wait -- Where are you --
LOCKE
Someone needs this water back at
the beach
JACK
(standing)
I‘1l come with you
LOCKE
No You need to finish what you

started
And hoping Locke might actually have the ANSWER --

JACK
Why

LOST White Rabbit (PINK) 8904 42
(CONTD) 41
LOCKE
Because a leader can’t lead until
he know’s where he’s going

And with that Locke melts back into the jungle OFF JACK
looking after him -- a lot to think about

EXT BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON 42

And SOMEONE ELSE is moving briskly through the late day
Crossing the SAND of the beach this person slips into

THE TREE LINE -- 43

And a PATCH OF DENSE FOLIAGE A HAND reaches in pushes the
LEAVES aside to reveal --

THREE SUITCASES The hider of this STASH is of course --
SAWYER And we’re close on him as he POPS OPEN one of the
suitcases revealing an array of goodies - SUNTAN LOTION BUG
SPRAY CANDY CIGARETTES LIGHTERS MEDICINE ALCOHOL

And as he reaches for a pack of the SMOKES

The CRACK of a twig behind him SPINS AROUND in time to see -

KATE RUSHING HIM 44

It’s a flat-out fucking TACKLE and this girl really fucking
knows what she’s doing because in a matter of seconds --

She’s PINNED Sawyer -- her KNEES pressing hard into his
shoulders -- a provocative position under any other set of
circumstances As soon as Sawyer recognizes his attacker --

SAWYER
It’s about time

KATE
(fierce)
About time for what

SAWYER
I made this birthday wish four

years ago

Kate’s eyes BURN as SAYID emerges from the jungle --

SAYID
Does he have it

LOST White Rabbit (PINK) 8904

(CONTD) 44
SAWYER KATE
What You two follow me out
here I wanna see a warrant -- Where’s the water you--
And Sawyer suddenly PUSHES UP TWISTS -- ROLLS OVER -- and
now he’s pinning Kate down -- He GRINS out of breath --
SAWYER

That’s better
KATE
-- Get off me

But Sayid is already there PULLS Sawyer up PUSHES him --
Fed up with the cutesy bullshit --

SAYID
Give the water to us now

SAWYER
(pissed)
Touch me again

Kate gets up moves to the SUITCASES Pulls them open --

More BOOZE SMOKES ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT -- But NO WATER --
SAWYER
You really think I stole your damn
water
SAYID

We know you gave two bottles to the
Korean couple

Sawyer takes a step forward -- gets in Sayid’s FACE --
SAWYER
I don’t give nothin’ to nobody
KATE
It’s not here
SAWYER
(real slow so Sayid can
understand)

I traded Mr Miyagi the last water
I had for a fish he caught -- we
worked it out caveman-style

(skeptical)
You gave up your last two bottles

SAWYER (contd)
(smiles)
And hell I’m an optimist
And there’s something about him -- despite the fucking

bravado -- that makes it instantly clear that Sawyer is
absolutely INNOCENT He’s telling the truth

So they’re back to square one And still without water
Sayid turns to Kate --

SAYID
Come on let’s go

Sayid starts back into the jungle as Kate levels Sawyer with
a look He just SMILES Kate shakes her head goes to
follow Sayid when --

SAWYER
Hey You forgot something

Kate turns as Sawyer tosses her a large LEATHER WALLET Kate
is confused but FLIPS IT OPEN TO REVEAL --

IT’S THE MARSHAL’S BADGE

SAWYER

Seeing as you’re the sheriff now

might as well make it official
Ah The IRONY
But Kate KEEPS the badge Slides it into her pocket as she
heads back to the beach Sawyer watches her go pops a smoke
into his mouth And as the FLAME flicks from his lighter --
EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT 45
We’re deep in a small CAMPFIRE PULLING OUT OF IT TO FIND --

JACK Alone Staring into the fire And he’s in that zone
of non-sleep where he is actually HYPER-AWAKE

And there is something about these flames that is familiar to
him And as Jack looks deeply into them --

INT HALLWAY - RECEPTION - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 46

FLAMES flicker in BLACK and WHITE PULL OUT to find them on a
small TELEVISION We’re watching a local NEWS BRAODCAST

JACK sits in a small chair in a spartan HALLWAY watching the

AUSTRALIAN NEWSCASTER (0S)
And wildfires continue to burn just
outside Melbourne While local
crews coordinate their efforts an
arson investigation is underway

And the NEWSCAST is interrupted as Jack looks up to see --

DOCTOR (0OS)
Mr Shephard Will you follow me

please
A Middle-Eastern MAN in a white lab coat -- looks like a
DOCTOR And although we’re not entirely sure why yet Jack’s
eyes make it clear -- he does not want to follow this man

Not at ALL

47 INT HALLWAY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 47

JACK and THE DOCTOR walk along the corridor This place is

DOCTOR
There are ways we can make it
easier for you We can take a

JACK

No I want to see him
The two reach THREE STAINLESS STEEL DOORS -- FREEZERS The
Doctor pulls open the middle one
ON JACK as he follows the Doctor--
A48 INSIDE A48
A GURNEY waits ON IT
A BODYBAG
The Doctor looks at Jack one last time
Then slowly he pulls down the bag’s zipper revealing the
body inside and of course it’s--

And completely lifeless

DOCTOR
I’m very sorry

JACK
What happened

DOCTOR JACK
(sympathetic)
It’s probably best not to -- What happened

know the details Mr

And as the Doctor begins to speak we HOLD ON JACK -- PUSHING
IN as every second brings more emotion A deeper sense of
pain and loss And it is fucking DEVASTATING to watch

DOCTOR (0S)
The police found him in an alley in
Kings Cross There was no
identification so they brought him
here Our tox screen showed a
blood alcohol content which for
a man of his size would most likely
have brought on myocardial
infarction -- a sizeable and fatal
heart attack

(best bedside manner)
If it’s any consolation it was
painless

And now we are RIGHT UP on Jack’s EYES And in this the
single most devastating moment of his life the last word
that comes to mind is “painless” And as a SINGLE TEAR drops
from his eye

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

We find that same tear sliding down his cheek back at the
CAMPFIRE And Jack is snapped out of this quiet repose by --

THAT SOUND Ice cubes in a glass

Jack immediately LEAPS TO HIS FEET Something moving through
the JUNGLE beyond the fire Maybe we can just make out the
WHITE TENNIS SHOES

And Jack is way beyond rational now as he PULLS A PIECE OF
WOOD FROM THE FIRE -- a makeshift TORCH --

And he moves into the moonlight-dappled jungle -- Almost like
he’s SLEEPWALKING -- following what just might be a GHOST --

And he soon comes to a NATURAL STONE ARCHWAY

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404 47
(CONTD)

Jack pauses -- a sense of whatever lies beyond -- but it’s
too fucking late to turn back now -- his journey almost at
its inevitable conclusion

So he moves through the archway AND for the first time we
enter our SET

INT THE VALLEY - NIGHT 49

MOONLIGHT pierces through the obscured ceiling of this caved-
in VALLEY lighting Jack’s way --

And his father is nowhere to be seen

But Jack hears the sound of TRICKLING WATER Drawn to it --

And here’s a WALL OF WATER dripping into a SHALLOW POOL
Jack approaches -- looks into it and --

There’s a small pale FACE shimmering under the surface But
Jack seems more confused than scared as he reaches into the
water and pulls out --

A CHINA FACED DOLL -- blonde hair floral dress Jack lays
the doll down walks deeper into THE VALLEY his torchlight
illuminating the openings of a series of CAVES

And there are more dolls MANY MORE A TRAIL of them Jack
follows it raising his flaming torch as he finally comes to
the source -- A SMASHED CRATE And right next to it --

A fallen fifteen foot-long section of WRECKAGE from our
place The OCEANIC LOGO PROMINENT

All around this area of the valley scattered pieces of
LUGGAGE OF CARGO Jack looking it over

And then he FREEZES

Because there at the edge of a cave trapped partially under
a piece of wreckage is what looks like a LARGE BOX

And Jack is drawn to it THIS is why he’s been led here
THIS is what he’s supposed to find

Yeah It’s a COFFIN

END OF ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INT THE VALLEY - NIGHT 50

Jack stands right where we left him in this moonlit cave-
like VALLEY

And he’s just FIXATED on that banged-up but surprisingly
intact SIMPLE WOODEN CASKET which lies FACE DOWN in the dirt

And this time it’s not Jack that we PUSH INTO but that
coffin as we hear the sound of a PLANE TAKING OFF and --

INT SYDNEY AIRPORT - DAY - FLASHBACK 51

Were in SYDNEY AIRPORT

And here’s Jack Wearing the very same SUIT we saw him
wearing in the Pilot He stands at the OCEANIC CUSTOMER
SERVICE COUNTER And he is fucking losing it

JACK
What do you mean you won’t put it
on the plane

A FEMALE AUSTRALIAN TICKET AGENT looks back at him --

TICKET AGENT
I’m sorry Mr Shephard but our
policy is that the body must have
the proper documentation if we’re
to put it on board I’m afraid
there’s no latitude to

JACK TICKET AGENT
No latitude No latitude
-- Without the proper
documents

JACK TICKET AGENT
You can’t do this to me I’m
read to go now -- Sir perhaps another

carrier may

JACK
(enough)
NO
And he fucking SHOUTED THAT People standing around actually
look over nervously But Jack could care less He leans in
to the DESK ATTENDANT eyes burning --

JACK

I want you to listen to me okay
Because I’m asking you a favor

(reads her name-tag)
“Chrissy” I am standing in front
of you wearing the same suit I’m
wearing to my father’s funeral and
I’m asking you a favor

(beat)
In sixteen hours I need to land in
LAX And I need that coffin to
clear customs because there is
going to be a hearse waiting there
And that hearse needs to take me
and that coffin to a cemetery
Why Chrissy Why can’t I just
land and bring him to a funeral
home and make all the arrangements
there Why can’t I really take my
time with it Because I need it to

be done I need it to be over

And Jack suddenly realizes he’s YELLING Stops Pulls

himself together But his eyes are watering And this is

said softly but not without desperation --
JACK

I just need to bury my father

And Chrissy is actually MOVED by this Affected by Jack’s
pure emotion So after a beat she NODS --

TICKET AGENT
Let me see what I can do sir

And as Jack finally registers some sense of RELIEF
52 INT THE VALLEY - NIGHT 52
We’re back on the island In this valley

And Jack looks down at what we now know to be his FATHER’S
CASKET Neither one of them made it to Los Angeles

But Jack has found it Been led to it
So now finally he’1ll get to bury his father himself

And as much as we don’t want him to do it we have to WATCH
HIM as he carefully slips his hand under the casket

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404 50

(CONTD) 52
Jack squats -- then with great STRAIN he manages to LIFT IT
UP - pushing it on to its side -- but OH FUCK -- the lid

FLIPS OPEN

BUT THE COFFIN IS EMPTY

Jack is confused Devastated And then ultimately --
DEPRIVED

Maybe the body fell out in the crash -- maybe it’s still out
there in the jungle -- or maybe

But none of that matters now Because all of this pressure
this anxiety this fucking situation is all so UNFAIR

And that translates to pure RAGE for Jack ANGER at not
being able to put this behind him and ANGER at his father
for haunting him even here

And Jack’s pulling a METAL ROD from the wreckage raising it
over his hand and he --

SMASHES the coffin Over and over Into fucking splinters

And as we PULL BACK leaving Jack to resolve his demons the
only way he knows how

EXT BEACH - MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY AREA - NIGHT 53

We QUIETLY MOVE towards the INFIRMARY TENT -- the sense that
this is the POINT OF VIEW of someone as we MOVE THROUGH THE
PLASTIC FLAP AND INSIDE TO FIND --

INT INFIRMARY TENT - NIGHT 54

CLAIRE as she lies asleep She’s alone We’re looking down
at her No -- SOMEONE’S LOOKING DOWN AT HER and

A bottle of WATER is brought to her chapped lips Claire’s
eyes flicker open as the cool liquid flows into her mouth
Someone has come to her rescue And Claire looks up to see
her benefactor is

BOONE

He offers an awkward smile -- screws the cap on the remainder
of the bottle places another FULL ONE by her side

CLAIRE BOONE
How did you
-- Shhhh

LOST White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 54
And we don’t get much of a chance to put this all together
because a VOICE from the entrance of the tent snaps us out of
this quiet moment --

VOICE (0S)
Where did you get that

WHIP AROUND TO REVEAL --

CHARLIE And he ain’t happy

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

BOONE takes a full face-plant into the SAND

CHARLIE
Here’s your thief

We’re out on the BEACH Charlie (that old DARKNESS in full
effect) is surrounded by Michael Hurley Sun Jin Walt
Sawyer -- a few of the other survivors --

MICHAEL
Where’d he hide it

CHARLIE
Dunno -- but this wanker had three
bottles on him
(to Boone)
Why’d you do it Pretty Boy Eh

HAND-HELD CHAOTIC SCARY MOB MENTALITY EMERGING Boone

surrounded on all sides scrambles to his feet -- PANICKED --
BOONE
I didn’t think You just left it
in the tent And he Jack just
took off
CHARLIE BOONE
Claire could’ve died -- I tried to give her some

sooner but it got out of
hand Nobody would’ve
understood

CHARLIE
(to the others)
I say we throw him in the jungle
and see what happens

SHANNON runs up -- locks eyes with Boone -- No fucking idea
what to do

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD)

KATE and SAYID are right behind her --

KATE
What’s going on

SAWYER
(nods to Boone)
Guess you got your thief

Boone pleads to Kate -- maybe she’ll understand

BOONE CHARLIE
I was trying to help
Someone needed to take
responsibility It never -- Oh SHUT IT
would have lasted unless

SLAM Boone goes flying into the sand again
And it’s out of control Six days on the island The
stress The frustration The situation This is the very

worst of human nature because --

The fucking MOB wants blood

Charlie ROUGHLY pulls Boone back up -- Pushes him into what
feels like a tightly constricting CIRCLE --

And as Boone looks around at all these angry faces these
people who might just TEAR HIM LIMB FROM LIMB --

VOICE (0S)
LEAVE HIM ALONE

And everything just STOPS

Were ON KATE as she turns towards the sound of that powerful
voice And thank fucking God

IT’S JACK 57

And he might still be unshaven He might be fucking
exhausted But there is a LIGHT in his eyes now

The same light in his eyes when he got his ass kicked on the
playground twenty years ago

And they’re ALL just staring at him

He starts quietly at first --

JACK
It’s been six days and we’re all
still waiting Still waiting for
them to come
(beat)
But what if they don’t

Jack steps forward -- engaging each person one at a time as
he speaks Powerful Charismatic FEARLESS

JACK

We have to stop waiting We need
to start figuring things out A
woman died this morning because she
went for a morning swim

(points to Boone)
He tried to save her life and now
you’re about to crucify him because
he took some water

Charlie drops his eyes --

JACK
We can’t do this We can’t just
hope it‘ll figure itself out It’s

time to start organizing We need
to figure out how we’re going to
survive I found water -- fresh
water in the valley I’1ll take a
group in at first light You don’t
want to come Then you find
another way to contribute because
“every man for himself” isn’t gonna
work anymore people Last week
most of us were strangers But now
were all here And God knows how
long we’re gonna be here but

(beat)
If we can’t live together we’re
gonna die alone
And as we see them -- ALL of them -- just looking at Jack

Looking UP to him And yeah there’s gonna be some bumps
along the way but it’s pretty fucking clear --

We’ve just witnessed the birth of a LEADER
CUT TO BLACK

And once again CALM has come to the beach

Walk amongst the castaways with the RED SUITCASE -- doling
out HALF-CUPS of water to the SURVIVORS as we FIND --

SUN and JIN 59
Sun looks at her husband as he builds them a SMALL FIRE
SUN
Thank you
(beat)

For getting me water today

Jin pauses for a moment Looks at his wife Then as simple
as it is touching --

JIN
Thats what husbands do

And now we FLOAT OVER to --
MICHAEL and WALT 60

Michael watches his son sleeping Has his half-cup of water
but his kid’s fine Not worth waking him up for

So instead he gives his water to VINCENT
As the dog laps it up appreciatively we FIND --
BOONE 61

Sits away from the camp ALONE Spared a beating but a
pariah nonetheless

SAWYER (0S)
How’s it feel

Boone looks up to see Sawyer

BOONE
How’s what feel

SAWYER
Taking my place at the top of
everyone’s most hated list

LOST “White Rabbit (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 8404
(CONTD) 61

Boone just looks at him

SAWYER
Yeah Sucks don’t it

And as Sawyer strides off to wherever it is he strides off
to we leave Boone to FIND --

JACK

He sits at a small FIRE close to the ocean Kate settles
down next to him hands him a cup of WATER --

JACK
Thanks

A few beats pass as they take in the night ocean together

KATE
Where were you today Jack

JACK
Just taking care of some things

As always not much has to be said between these two In
some kind of cosmic way they just GET each other

KATE
That’s all I’m gonna get huh

A few more beats pass Then --

JACK
My father died In Sydney
Kate reacts -- surprised but instantly sympathetic
KATE

I’m sorry

Jack nods His eyes watering with the intensity of his day
Watering with the closure he will not get

JACK
Yeah I’m sorry too

And as the two of them sit there in this moment of quiet
simplicity

FADE TO BLACK
