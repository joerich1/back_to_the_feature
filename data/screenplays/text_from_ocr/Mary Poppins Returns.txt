EXT THE LONDON EMBANKMENTDOCKS MARCH 1934 - MORNING

The river Thames at daybreak street-lamps reflected in the
water TILT UP to reveal the London Embankment Big Ben in
the background

Jack an eternally optimistic lamplighter climbs a ladder
that leans against a lamppost silhouetted against the dawn
He dims the light and slides down to the ground

“LOVELY LONDON SKY

JACK
WHEN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS
HAVE COME AND GONE
THROUGH THE MISTY MORNING SHOWERS
I GREET THE DAWN
FOR WHEN ITS LIGHT HAS HIT THE GROUND
THERES LOTS OF TREASURES TO BE FOUND
UNDERNEATH THE LOVELY LONDON SKY

Jack folds his ladder and fastens it to the back of his
bicycle He climbs on and rides off

EXT THE DOCKS NEAR THE EMBANKMENT - CONTINUOUS

Dropping down from the rooftops of London we discover
workers unloading crates and barrels of fresh produce on the
docks Jack slaloms through it all as he continues on his
way

JACK
THOUGH THE LAMPS IM TURNING DOWN
PLEASE DONT FEEL BLUE
FOR IN THIS PART OF LONDON TOWN
THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH

Jack stops at a lamppost and dims the lamp Ahead NEEDY
LONDONERS stand on a soup kitchen queue that snakes around
the corner VOLUNTEERS hand out food to them

DONT BELIEVE THE THINGS YOUVE READ

YOU NEVER KNOW WHATS UP AHEAD

UNDERNEATH THE LOVELY LONDON SKY
Jack grabs an apple as he swerves past a fruit cart and
tosses it to a MAN ON THE QUEUE
EXT TOWER BRIDGE - MORNING

Jack rides along the embankment the bridge at his back
EXT NEIGHBORHOOD PUB - CONTINUOUS

As Jack rides down an alley adjacent to a pub three STREET
URCHINS chase behind him

An urchin helps him to shut off a street-lamp

JACK
HAVE A POT OF TEA
MEND YOUR BROKEN CUP
THERES A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW
AWAITING YOU
IF YOU WOULD JUST LOOK UP
I KNOW

A PUB LANDLORD sweeps the footpath

PUB LANDLORD
Oi get out of it

The urchins run off down the alley as Jack rides down the
street

JACK
-YESTERDAY YOU HAD TO BORROW
FROM YOUR CHUMS
SEEMS THE PROMISE OF TOMORROW
NEVER COMES

EXT ST PAUL’S CATHEDRAL - DAY

Jack passes St Paul’s A few HOMELESS PEOPLE sleep on the
cathedral steps

JACK
BUT SINCE YOU DREAMED THE NIGHT AWAY
TOMORROWS HERE ITS CALLED TODAY
SO COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS YOURE A
LUCKY GUY
FOR YOURE UNDERNEATH THE LOVELY
LONDON SKY

He rides through a flock of pigeons scattering them and
taking us up past the dome

EXT THE PARK -— DAY

CLOSE on Jack’s wheels as he winds his way through the park

As he rides along the path he nods to a gruff PARK KEEPER
spearing rubbish into a bag who gives him a dirty look
EXT CHERRY TREE LANE -— CONTINUOUS

Jack whistles as he rides onto Cherry Tree Lane a street
lined with 19th-Century homes

He passes the neighboring MILKMAN giving him a wave

MILKMAN
Mornin’ Jack

Jack glances up to a rooftop that has been fitted to look
like the deck of a ship - at the moment though no one is at
the helm He looks up worried

Finally the rooftop door creaks open and ADMIRAL BOOM
appears pushed in a wheelchair by his First Mate BINNACLE

BINNACLE
(Blows whistle )
Admiral above decks

Jack smiles saluting the sailors

JACK
LISTEN SOON THIS SLUMP’LL
DISAPPEAR
IT WON’T BE LONG
SOONER THAN ‘YA THINK YOU’LL HEAR
SOME BRIGHT NEW SONG

He sets up his ladder at the lamppost that stands before 17
Cherry Tree Lane - a modest house which has fallen slightly
into disrepair

A BOY AND GIRL appear at the window in the upper floor of the
Banks home waving

JACK (contd)
Y’awright children

Jack waves to the children They wave back and exit Jack
climbs the ladder

JACK (contd)
SO HOLD ON TIGHT TO THOSE YOU LOVE
AND MAYBE SOON FROM UP ABOVE
YOULL BE BLESSED SO KEEP ON
LOOKING HIGH
WHILE YOU’RE UNDERNEATH THE LOVELY
LONDON SKY
OVELY LONDON SKY

Jack dims the light and glances up into the sky He slides
down the ladder climbs onto his bicycle and rides off

BIG BEN TOLLS eight o’clock in the distance A black car
pulls up as Jack rides off
Two men in suits get out of the car GOODING and FRYE The
men set their watches by the toll of the bell then walk up
the path to the house

UP ABOVE the Admiral and Binnacle have just made it across
the rooftop The Admiral is outraged

ADMIRAL BOOM
Great steaming clams - they’ve done
it again Those blundering blowfish
have rung Big Ben too soon

BINNACLE
Storm clouds on the horizon Sir
Heading straight for Cherry Tree
Lane

ADMIRAL BOOM
Batten down the hatches Mr
Binnacle Rough seas ahead I fear
Both men react as a SCREAM comes from the Bank’s household
ELLEN (0S)
AAAHHH
INT THE BANKS FRONT ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Inside the Banks family home the house shows some signs of
wear and inattention

ELLEN (0S)
(The scream continues )
AAAHHH

The door that leads into the kitchen flies open - water can
be seen spraying the room ELLEN the housekeeper runs into
the hall in a panic and calls upstairs

ELLEN (contd)
MICHAEL JANE

JANE and MICHAEL BANKS rush in from the parlor behind Ellen

MICHAEL
What is it Ellen

ELLEN
The bloomin’ sink’s exploded

MICHAEL
Not again

AUNT JANE
Oh dear
Michael rushes into the kitchen The boy and girl we saw
earlier ANNABEL and JOHN run down the steps

AUNT JANE (contd)
Oh - Annabel John -

ANNABEL
We heard Aunt Jane - I’1l ring the
plumbers

JOHN
I’1l turn off the water at the mains

John runs down into the cellar

AUNT JANE
(Going into the kitchen )
Thank you darlings - Ellen fetch
us a mop and towels will you

ELLEN
(Grumbling to herself)
I told ‘im to get them pipes fixed
They been there since the Romans
ruled

Ellen disappears into the cellar GEORGIE comes down the
stairs carrying his stuffed giraffe “Gillie”

GEORGIE
What’s happening

ANNABEL
Don’t go in the kitchen Georgie -
not without your Wellies -
(On phone )
Yes hello We’ve had a burst pipe
(There is a TAPPING at the
front door On phone )
Excuse me —
(Calling )
Ellen could you please get the
door I’ve got the plumbers here

Ellen comes out of the cellar with the mop and towels

ELLEN
That was quick work wasn’t it

Hands full she gives the towels to Georgie
ELLEN (contd)
Here Georgie - take these
(Heading to the door )
Alright alright - I’m coming

Gooding and Frye stand outside tacking up a notice
GOODING
Ah Good morning mum

ELLEN
They don’t look like plumbers

ANNABEL
(Looks over )
I meant on the phone

GOODING
We are not plumbers - we’re
lawyers

ELLEN

Lawyers Here’s me hopin’ you’d
prove useful

She absentmindedly hands the mop to Gooding and shuts the door

Aunt Jane
her dress

She wraps

JOHN
Water’s off

ANNABEL
(hanging up)
And the plumbers are on their way

comes out of the kitchen her hair and the front of
drenched with water

AUNT JANE
Well done everyone Phew Such
excitement

GEORGIE
What are you doing here Aunt Jane

AUNT JANE
(She takes a towel from
Georgie to dry off)
We’re handing out breakfasts at the
union hall I snuck away for
morning hugs Come here

the towel around Georgie and gives the three

children a hug

Aunt Jane

takes the towels and heads back into the kitchen

Georgie picks up a towel she has accidentally dropped
following her into the kitchen

There’s a knock at the door Ellen goes over and opens it

ELLEN
Will you stop that bangin’ It’s
barely eight o’clock on a Sunday
mornin’

ELLEN (contd)
(She sees her mop grabs
it)
Wot’cher doin’ with my mop

FRYE
Forgive the intrusion mum Our
current workload prevents us taking
weekends off

GOODING
We would like to have a word with
Mr Banks if he is available

Ellen finally sees the notice on the door

ELLEN
“Notice of Repossession”

Frye by far the more sympathetic of the two sighs loudly
and nods sadly looking genuinely pained Ellen glares

ELLEN (contd)
Wait there

She goes back inside John and Annabel quickly turn away
pretending not to be paying attention The lawyers peer
through the door as Michael re-enters from the kitchen
thoroughly soaked followed by Georgie As Michael takes off
his jacket

MICHAEL
I’ll be cleaning up that mess all
morning

ANNABEL

(Reaching for the jacket)
Here Let me take that father

MICHAEL
Oh thank you darling

Annabel runs upstairs with the jacket

ELLEN
(Undisguised contempt )
‘Scuse me sir - the wolves are at
the door

MICHAEL
What do they want

ELLEN
A good thrashin’ if you ask me
(She looks into the
kitchen sighs)
Looks like the River Thames in
there
Aunt Jane comes out as Michael takes the mop from Ellen

MICHAEL
Don’t worry - I’1ll clean up Ellen
Why don’t you see to breakfast

ELLEN
Suppose someone ‘as to - ‘less we
all want to starve

She goes into the kitchen

AUNT JANE
(Aside to Michael)
Why don’t you let Ellen clean up

MICHAEL
(A resigned sigh)
Im afraid lately that means more
work for me The other day I found
a butcher’s sack hanging on the
coat rack - and my hat was in the
larder

Aunt Jane catches sight of her damp hair in the hall mirror

AUNT JANE
I need a brush - I look a fright
(As she goes upstairs )
Don’t forget you have guests at the
door Michael

MICHAEL
Right -
(He goes to the door
dodging the children)
I’m sorry We’re struggling through
a bit of chaos this morning -

They take a step into the hallway Michael closes the door
behind them

GOODING
So it seems Unfortunately Mr
Banks our business cannot wait

Ellen reappears from the kitchen

ELLEN
Excuse me sir - how exactly am I
supposed to make breakfast when
there’s nothing in the larder but
pickled herring and marmalade

MICHAEL
(Hand to forehead )
The groceries - I meant to go
yesterday
ELLEN
(She nods turns to go)
Very well then Pickled herring
for breakfast marmalade for lunch

JOHN
(Once Ellen has gone )
That little shop across the park
will be open The three of us can
go

MICHAEL
Oh thank you John

GEORGIE
(Aside to Annabel )
But you said we would go to the

park today
ANNABEL
We’ll cut through the park on the
way
GEORGIE
But -
ANNABEL

Enough Georgie Come along
John takes the mop from Michael

JOHN
Ill take that Father

MICHAEL
Thank you

Aunt Jane comes back downstairs as the twins lead Georgie
into the kitchen Michael gestures for the lawyers to join
him in the parlor Aunt Jane follows putting on her coat

MICHAEL (contd)
Please come through -

INT THE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

MICHAEL
Now what is it I can do for you

GOODING
I am Hamilton Gooding this is Mr
Templeton Frye We are solicitors
with the law firm of Gordy Cordry
Gooding and Frye

Aunt Jane suppresses a laugh

GOODING (contd)
What

AUNT JANE
Nothing

Gooding notices the poster sticking out of Aunt Jane’s
notebook

GOODING
SPRUCE Is that your garden club

AUNT JANE
No it’s the “Society for the
Protection of the Rights of the
Underpaid Citizens of England”

GOODING
A labour organizer
(Archly polite to Frye)
She’s a labour organizer

Gooding and Frye sit on the sofa Michael sits in the
armchair opposite Aunt Jane moves round tying her belt

AUNT JANE
Well yes - we also run soup
kitchens - it’s a never-ending job
these days

FRYE
I’m sure it is Mrs Banks

AUNT JANE
Miss Banks actually I’m Michael’s
sister

MICHAEL

My wife passed away this last year

FRYE
That’s awful Those poor children

GOODING
Our deepest condolences

MICHAEL
Thank you Forgive me - what brings
the two of you here this morning

AUNT JANE
I’m going to say my good-byes

Aunt Jane kisses Michael on the cheek and heads out

GOODING
Mr Banks you took out a loan with
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank last year
against the value of your home

Aunt Jane stops and steps back to Michael

AUNT JANE
You did what Michael

MICHAEL
I had to Jane I didn’t have much
choice what with Kate and the
bills piling up -

FRYE
Hard enough these days isn’t it

GOODING
Yes well it seems you’ve fallen
three months behind in payments -

MICHAEL
I am sorry Kate my wife used to
handle all our finances you see
and I’ve been a bit off my stride
(Stands walks to desk)
How much is it I owe you exactly

GOODING
Unfortunately the bank is now
demanding you pay back the entire
loan in full

MICHAEL
The entire loan

GOODING
Yes - it’s all in the contract

MICHAEL
That’s more than I make in a year I
couldn’t possibly

FRYE
Oh dear

Gooding stands to leave picking up his hat and briefcase

GOODING
You have five days If you are
unable to pay in full by Friday at
midnight I’m afraid we will have
to repossess your home and you
will have to vacate the premises

Frye sighs distraught Gooding glances over irritated
MICHAEL
But I work at Fidelity Fiduciary

GOODING
Not as an accountant I presume

MICHAEL
No as a teller - I took a part-
time position there this past year
You see I’m really an artist -

GOODING
Be that as it may -

MICHAEL
But my father George Banks was a
senior partner there

AUNT JANE
(A realization )
Father left us bank shares You
could use them to pay off the loan

MICHAEL
I was saving those for the
children but -

Frye stands

FRYE
Shares In the bank
(Brightly to Gooding )
That does change things doesn’t it

GOODING
Do you have the share certificate

AUNT JANE
Sorry The what

FRYE
The document -

GOODING
The document proving you own shares
in the bank

MICHAEL
I suppose it must be somewhere
among father’s old papers

EXT THE ADMIRAL’S ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

On the rooftop next door the Admiral and Binnacle
finally prepared to fire off the 8 am cannon

are

ADMIRAL BOOM
Primed and ready Mr Binnacle

BINNACLE
Ready and charged sir

ADMIRAL BOOM
On my mark Three two one - FIRE
BOOM

INT THE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS
Inside the cannon fire rattles the walls knocking

everything askew and terrifying the lawyers A clock and an
urn land in Gooding’s hands Ash flies out of the fireplace

GOODING
Good heavens Are you housing
anarchists

Michael and Aunt Jane behave as though this is perfectly
normal they begin pushing all the furniture and belongings
back into place as they speak

AUNT JANE
No that’s the Admiral He fires
off a cannon to mark the hour

FRYE
(He checks his watch )
But he’s over five minutes late

MICHAEL
Yes I’m afraid he’s been running a
little behind these last few years

Michael and Aunt Jane push the piano back in place

GOODING
As are we this morning You’ve
been given notice
(Hands Michael the notice)
We’1ll see ourselves out Come along
Mr Frye

FRYE
(putting on his hat)
I hope you find that share
certificate I really do

GOODING
Good day to you both
(As they leave to Frye)
You really have chosen the wrong
profession you know

The door shuts

AUNT JANE
Why didn’t you tell me you had
taken out a loan Michael

Michael moves away from Jane

MICHAEL

I didn’t want to worry you - or the
children I kept thinking I would
catch up Kate always managed

(He shakes his head)
Of all the thick-headed mistakes
I can’t lose our home Jane She’s
everywhere here

AUNT JANE
Well then we aren’t going to let
that happen But Michael you know
we neither of us have enough money
between us - so we just have to
find that share certificate Do you
have any idea where father might
have kept it

MICHAEL
Up in the attic I suppose
(He tucks away his
emotions smiles)
- I’m sorry I didn’t mean to
bring you into all this

AUNT JANE
(Exasperated )
Michael This is our family home
and you’re about to lose it - so
stop pretending everything’s fine

GEORGIE (0S)
Are we going to lose our home

Michael and Aunt Jane turn Georgie and the
entered from the dining room in their coats
been listening to them

MICHAEL
Oh no - no of course not
Georgie

AUNT JANE

I was saying you won’t have to
worry because your father owns
shares in the bank

GEORGIE
But you said we don’t have enough
money

twins having
and wellies have

Michael grabs paper and pen and sketches something

MICHAEL
Well I can make more - I ama
banker now aren’t I That’s what
bankers do - make money

GEORGIE
But you’re not a banker - you’re a
painter

MICHAEL

Yes well - painters don’t make
money Not these days Here you
see The day has hardly begun and
I’ve already made you 10 pounds

Michael hands Georgie what he’s drawn - a decent likeness of
a 10-pound note Annabel and John exchange a glance seeing
through Michael’s false cheer instantly Georgie smiles

JOHN
(Looking at his watch)
We’d best be going

AUNT JANE
Let’s get your hats on then

Annabel goes to the front hall coat rack to get their hats

MICHAEL
(With a wink handing a
few coins to John)
John one moment Georgie shouldn’t
have to spend his 10 pounds on the
shopping - here you are

JOHN
Thank you father

ELLEN
(Entering )
Off to the park now I see

ANNABEL
Yes - that’s right Ellen

Ellen helps the children with their hats Aunt Jane takes off
her coat as she heads for the stairs

AUNT JANE
(To Michael )
Shall we search the attic then

MICHAEL
Don’t you have to go to work

AUNT JANE
(Rolling up her sleeves)
Work can wait

Michael follows her up the stairs

MICHAEL
Thank you Jane - yes I’11 look in
the attic Why don’t you check
father’s old wardrobe

Ellen follows the children to the front door

JOHN
We’1ll make lunch when we get home
Ellen

Annabel takes Gillie from Georgie handing it to Ellen

ANNABEL
Gillie stays here

ELLEN
(As the children leave)
Blimey - such little grown-ups
youve become

EXT THE PARK -— DAY

Annabel reads over the shopping list as the children walk
through the park

ANNABEL
Father didn’t give us enough did he

JOHN
Not nearly

ANNABEL
We can ask for day-old bread at half
off that’s what mother used to do

Georgie smiles seeing MISS LARK the children’s wealthy
neighbor walking her dog WILLOUGHBY

GEORGIE
Hello Willoughby Hello Miss Lark

MISS LARK
Hello Georgie Twins

JOHN
Come on Georgie we haven’t got
time for this

Willoughby barks Georgie notices a woman selling balloons
(BALLOON LADY) in the distance He cuts across the grass
toward her

GEORGIE
The balloon lady Can we get
balloons

ANNABEL
No Georgie - we haven’t enough for
groceries as it is

The Park Keeper appears calling to Georgie

PARK KEEPER
Oi Georgie Banks - keep off the
grass I don’t spend all day caring
for it just to see my work get
trampled on Go on hop it

Georgie sighs and reluctantly returns to the path

ANNABEL
Sorry

JOHN
(Quietly to Annabel )
What if Father does lose the house

ANNABEL
Well just have to figure out a way
to get it back I suppose

JOHN
Youre right That’s what mother
would do

INT THE ATTIC - DAY

The attic is a complete mess Michael’s easels canvases and
art supplies are all piled up in a corner Michael goes over
to an old desk He searches through its drawers then picks
up a wooden storage crate

Inside the crate Michael finds a jewelry box with an
engraved “K” on its lid When he opens it a gentle melody
plays He takes out a necklace of his wife’s gazing at ita
moment He sets the box aside and continues searching the
attic still holding the necklace - but he can’t get the
gentle melody out of his head

“A CONVERSATION

MICHAEL

WE HAVENT SPOKEN IN SO LONG DEAR

THIS YEAR HAS GONE BY IN A BLUR

TODAY SEEMS EVERYTHING’S GONE WRONG HERE

MICHAEL (contd)
I’M LOOKING FOR THE WAY THINGS WERE

I KNOW YOU’D LAUGH AND CALL ME TRAGIC
FOR EVERYTHINGS IN DISARRAY

THESE ROOMS WERE ALWAYS FULL OF MAGIC
THATS VANISHED SINCE YOU WENT AWAY

THIS HOUSE IS CROWDED NOW WITH QUESTIONS
YOUR JOHNS A WALKING QUESTIONNAIRE
AND I COULD SURELY USE A FEW SUGGESTIONS
ON HOW TO BRUSH OUR DAUGHTER’S HAIR

WHEN GEORGIE NEEDED EXPLANATIONS
YOU ALWAYS KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY
AND I MISS OUR FAMILY CONVERSATIONS
ITS SILENT SINCE YOU WENT AWAY

Michael looks out of the window

WINTER HAS GONE

BUT NOT FROM THIS ROOM

SNOWS LEFT THE LANE

BUT THE CHERRY TREES FORGOT TO BLOOM

He reminds himself to keep searching

The certificate The
certificate

ILL CARRY ON THE WAY YOU TOLD ME

I SAY THAT LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE

AND THOUGH YOU ARE NOT HERE TO HOLD ME
IN THE ECHOES I CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE

BUT STILL ONE QUESTION FILLS MY DAY DEAR
THE ANSWER IVE MOST LONGED TO KNOW

EACH MOMENT SINCE YOU WENT AWAY DEAR

MY QUESTION KATE IS WHERED YOU GO

As Aunt Jane enters Michael puts away the necklace and
closes the lid of the jewelry box turning away to hide his
emotions

AUNT JANE
Nothing in the wardrobe
(Gazing around the attic)
Oh my goodness

MICHAEL
(He turns back smiling )
Yes it’s quite a mess isn’t it

Aunt Jane notices Michael’s art supplies

AUNT JANE
What are all your art things doing
up here

MICHAEL
I wasn’t using them anymore I
should probably get rid of it all

AUNT JANE
Have you looked in father’s old
desk

MICHAEL

(pulling out an old
snowglobe)
I honestly don’t know why we kept
most of this stuff to begin with

He reaches into a nearby box and pulls out an old patched-up
kite with a suffragette banner for a tail

MICHAEL (contd)
I mean why on Earth did we save
this old broken thing

AUNT JANE
Don’t you remember that kite We
used to love flying that with
mother and father

MICHAEL
Well it won’t fly anymore Out it
goes - no looking back

Michael throws the beaten kite into the rubbish box and
carries it to the door

EXT THE HOUSE AT 17 CHERRY TREE LANE - DAY

Michael carries the trash bin out to leave by the side of the
house then goes back inside A beat and then the wind
stirs The kite shudders and lifts into the air blown out of
the trash bin

It skitters across the lane past Jack who is riding his
bicycle He stops in his tracks watching the kite skip by
The behavior of this kite strikes him as unusual to say the
least He glances up sensing something in the air

JACK
(Singing softly )
HOLD ON TIGHT TO THOSE YOU LOVE
AND MAYBE SOON FROM UP ABOVE

He pedals off in pursuit

EXT THE PARK - CONTINUOUS

In the park Willoughby the dog sees the kite tumble past and
barks madly

The kite swings up to hit a MAN ON A PARK BENCH in the back
of the head knocking off his bowler hat Barely reacting
the man calmly sets his hat back in place and continues
reading a newspaper

Up ahead the twins are poring over their errand list
Georgie lagging behind sees the kite tumble past - he
chases after it

ANNABEL
How long do you think it will take
us today

JOHN
Well let’s see It’s a nine minute
walk to the shop If it takes about
ten minutes to purchase each item
we should be back home by-

Jack races past John and Annabel on his bicycle

JACK
‘Scuse me children - coming
through

ANNABEL

Georgie Come back

JOHN
Georgie

The twins start after Georgie but the Park Keeper sees them

PARK KEEPER
You two - off the grass

JOHN
But our brother -

PARK KEEPER
You heard me - now

A gust of wind sends the kite over a hedge Georgie scrambles
through the hedge into a CLEARING getting his clothes
covered in mud The kite is there leaning against a stone
bridge as though waiting for him Georgie runs to it pulls
out the spool of string that’s been tucked in its frame and
raises the kite into the air Clouds gather and roil The
wind grows violent dragging Georgie off his feet as the kite
shoots up through the clouds

John and Annabel are rushing along the path when they hear

GEORGIE (0S)
Help

The twins charge out across the grass and dive under the
hedge

ANNABEL
WE’RE COMING GEORGIE

Jack meanwhile stops his bike on the nearby path and
hurries over to rescue Georgie

JACK
Hold on

Jack grabs hold of Georgie pulls him down They both pull on
the kite string with all their might The sky begins to calm
the clouds part and a figure holding onto the kite’s tail
comes into view

It is MARY POPPINS

Dressed in a long coat scarf and eccentric hat Mary
Poppins carries a carpetbag in her free hand and has a parrot-
headed umbrella tucked under her arm

JACK (contd)
As I live and breathe

The twins scramble through the bushes just in time to see
Mary Poppins glide the last five or so feet to the ground

The moment Mary Poppins lands she addresses Georgie Jack
reels in the kite string Brusquely

MARY POPPINS

You need to be more careful when
the wind rises Georgie - you
nearly lost your kite

(As the twins approach )
And you two nearly lost your
Georgie He might have got away
completely had I’d not been holding
on to the other end of that string

She brushes herself off taking note of the children’s
appearances

MARY POPPINS (contd)
My goodness Annabel - what have
you done to your clothes You could
grow a garden in that much soil
And John youre just as filthy

ANNABEL
How do you know our names

JACK
(Beaming )
Because she’s Mary Poppins of
course And may I say you look
lovely as always

MARY POPPINS
You really think so
It is nice to see you Jack -

JACK
Good to see you too Mary Poppins
(To the children )
I was just your age when we first
met working for a chimney sweep

Jack hands the kite back to Georgie

MARY POPPINS
How is dear old Bert

JACK
Traveling the world he is off to
points unknown

MARY POPPINS

Well now I am off to speak with the
father of these children - this
family is clearly in desperate need
of a nanny

(To the children )
Now quick march and best foot forward
and I’1ll thank you not to dawdle

Mary Poppins marches off Georgie at her side The twins
exchange a puzzled glance

JACK
Go on

The twins then hurry after their brother Jack follows behind
and picks up his bike off the ground

INT THE STAIRCASEFRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS
Georgie charges into the hall and shouts up the stairs

GEORGIE
Father Aunt Jane - come quick

Michael rushes to the top of the steps Georgie stands at the
base of the stairs holding the weatherbeaten kite excited

MICHAEL
What is it Georgie

AUNT JANE
Has something happened

GEORGIE
I was flying a kite and it got
caught on a nanny

Michael and Aunt Jane come downstairs

AUNT JANE

Whatever are you talking about
GEORGIE

Come look
MICHAEL

Wait - where did you get that kite

GEORGIE
I found it in the park
(Pointing to the door)
She kept it from blowing away

They look toward the front door as Mary Poppins steps into
the house for the first time in decades Michael is so taken
aback that he drops the papers he holds

MICHAEL
Mary

AUNT JANE
Poppins

MARY POPPINS
Close your mouth please Michael
We are still not a codfish

Aunt Jane giggles Mary Poppins gives her a sidelong glance

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Jane Banks - still rather inclined
to giggle I see

This stops Aunt Jane Michael beams Annabel and John run in
closing the door behind them

MICHAEL
-- Good heavens it really is you
You seem hardly to have aged at
all

MARY POPPINS
Really How rude One never
discusses a woman’s age Michael I
would have hoped I had taught you
better

MICHAEL
I’m sorry I didn’t mean -

AUNT JANE
You came back I thought we’d never
see you again

MICHAEL
It is wonderful to see you -

MARY POPPINS
(Admiring herself in the
mirror )
Yes it is isn’t it

ANNABEL
You know her then

As Mary Poppins crosses away from the mirror her reflection
remains behind watching her go

MICHAEL
Yes Mary Poppins used to be our
nanny

AUNT JANE
What brings you here after all this
time

MARY POPPINS
The same thing that brought me the
first time I’ve come to look after
the Banks children

The twins exchange a look

ANNABEL
Us

MARY POPPINS
(Turning )
- Oh yes - you too

ANNABEL
(A little huffy)
But we don’t need a nanny Mother
taught us to look after ourselves

MARY POPPINS
You did just misplace Georgie I
might point out

JOHN
Only slightly We got him back

ANNABEL
We can do anything a nanny can

GEORGIE
Mary Poppins flew here on a kite
You can’t do that can you

MICHAEL
What are you talking about
Georgie Don’t be silly

AUNT JANE
Oh let him believe what he likes
(To Georgie )
When your father and I were young we
used to imagine Mary Poppins could do
all sorts of impossible things

Georgie alone notices the parrot on the handle of Mary
Poppins’ umbrella coming to life

PARROT UMBRELLA
(Squawking )
Actually -

Mary Poppins calmly pinches the parrot’s beak shut

MICHAEL
‘Actually’ what

MARY POPPINS
Actually I’d like to get back to
the matter of my employment

GEORGIE
Your umbrella talks

MICHAEL
Georgie please - were in the
midst of a grown-up conversation

ANNABEL
Why don’t we go upstairs Georgie

GEORGIE
But it did talk I promise -

The twins lead Georgie upstairs Once they’ve gone

MICHAEL
I’m afraid sometimes Georgie suffers
from an excess of imagination

MARY POPPINS
As I recall you had the same
affliction yourself when you were
young

MICHAEL
Did I really Well those days are
long behind me

MARY POPPINS
Are they indeed
(She nods confirming
something to herself)
About my employment then -
MICHAEL
Yes about that - the truth is I
simply can’t afford -

MARY POPPINS
We can settle on terms later
although I will want my old room
back as long as it’s not a
complete disaster and I insist on
having every second Tuesday off

MICHAEL
But I’m afraid -

AUNT JANE
Of course Mary Poppins

Michael shoots Aunt Jane a look

MARY POPPINS
Good good That’s all settled
Then I’1l stay Now if you’1l
excuse me the children have turned
themselves into dustbins my first
order of business is to see them
properly bathed and dressed

Michael pulls Aunt Jane into the living room

MICHAEL

Have you gone completely mad Jane
I can’t afford to take on anyone
else

AUNT JANE
Mary Poppins isn’t just anyone
Don’t you see Michael No one’s
hiring nannies anymore The poor
woman has no place to go

MICHAEL
Neither will we by the end of the
week

AUNT JANE

Oh don’t be so grumpy You sound
just like father

MICHAEL
I do not

AUNT JANE
Give Mary Poppins a chance You need
help just as much as she does

MICHAEL
Oh very well She can stay for
the time being I suppose

MICHAEL (contd)
(Ironically )
After all she did fly all this way
on a kite

They share a laugh Aunt Jane smiles hesitates

Behind them Mary Poppins hops on the bannister and glides up
the stairs leaving her bag and umbrella behind

AUNT JANE
Those things when we were young -
they didn’t really

MICHAEL
(With a smile)
Happen No

AUNT JANE
No of course not

MICHAEL
Ridiculous

They laugh

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Mary Poppins glides up the bannister past Ellen carrying an
armful of fresh towels

ELLEN
Oh hello Mary Poppins

MARY POPPINS
Hello Ellen

Mary Poppins hops off the bannister Georgie is waiting for
her His jaw drops as the parrot umbrella and her carpetbag
float down from above and into her hands

GEORGIE
How did you do that

MARY POPPINS
Do what

GEORGIE
And why didn’t father believe you
flew here on a kite

MARY POPPINS
Because it’s complete nonsense of
course

PARROT UMBRELLA
(Squawking )
Grown-ups forget They always do

MARY POPPINS
(A sharp look )
That will be quite enough of that
I should have left you in the
umbrella stand

PARROT UMBRELLA
(Aghast )
Not with the canes

Mary Poppins marches into the nursery Georgie behind her

INT THE NURSERY - CONTINUOUS

John and Annabel are huddled together talking in hushed
tones when Mary Poppins arrives

MARY POPPINS
What are you two whispering about

JOHN AND ANNABEL
(Coming to attention )
Nothing

MARY POPPINS
(removing her hat)
“Nothing” is such a useful word isn’t
it It can mean anything and
everything

ANNABEL
It’s just that -

MARY POPPINS
- you don’t require the services of
a nanny

JOHN
Well we have grown up a good deal
in the past year after all

MARY POPPINS
Yes yes We’ll have to see what
can be done about that

Mary Poppins straightens the items on the fireplace She
reaches to adjust a china bowl on the mantelpiece

ANNABEL
That was our mother’s - be careful

MARY POPPINS
(Haughtily )
I am always careful

Mary Poppins unties her jacket belt

ANNABEL
(Anxious )
So you’re staying

MARY POPPINS
(removing her jacket belt)
Yes I’ll stay until the door
opens

JOHN
What does that mean

ANNABEL
(Looking to the nursery
door)
That door is always opening

Mary Poppins unbuttons and removes her coat

MARY POPPINS
Not that door - another one

Mary Poppins opens the cupboard doors and takes out some
clothes

GEORGIE
(Incredulous )
The bathroom door

JOHN
That’s just silly Georgie
(To Mary Poppins
uncertain )
Not the bathroom door

MARY POPPINS
(As she heads off )
No But a bath would prove useful
Come along - time for a good clean
start

INT THE BATHROOM - DAY

Steam clouds fill the air Georgie and the twins stand in
their 1930’s-style long underwear watching as Mary Poppins
draws a bath The twins aren’t in the least happy about it

ANNABEL
Our mother always had us take our
baths in the evening

MARY POPPINS
In my experience the perfect time
of day to have a bath is when one
needs a wash Georgie will go
first

Mary Poppins gathers towels and washcloths shampoo and a
fresh bar of soap which she places beside the tub

JOHN
We are perfectly capable of drawing
our own baths

MARY POPPINS
How very helpful John In that
case you may turn off the tap
(He reaches to do so)
But not quite yet - we still have
to put in the bubbles

JOHN
But I don’t like soap bubbles

Mary Poppins goes off to retrieve her bag

MARY POPPINS (0S)
Then you shall have to try to avoid
them at all costs

JOHN
(Quietly to Annabel )
She’s a tough nut isn’t she

ANNABEL
(Aloud )
Alright then but we’ll have to get
this done quickly

JOHN
Right we still have to get to the
grocers - and it looks as though it
might rain

GEORGIE
I know who you should ask

ANNABEL
Her umbrella can’t talk Georgie

Mary Poppins returns with her carpetbag shaking her head

MARY POPPINS
The very idea

GEORGIE
How do you know it can’t

ANNABEL
Because it can’t The very notion
is ridiculous

MARY POPPINS
Exactly right Annabel It’s
nonsense Foolishness

JOHN
It makes no sense And if it makes
no sense it can’t be true

Mary Poppins pulls a bottle of soap bubbles from her bag
“CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT

MARY POPPINS
JOHN YOU’RE RIGHT
IT’S GOOD TO KNOW YOU’RE BRIGHT
FOR INTELLECT CAN WASH AWAY CONFUSION

GEORGIE SEES
AND ANNABEL AGREES
MOST FOLDEROL’S AN OPTICAL ILLUSION

YOU THREE KNOW IT’S TRUE
THAT ONE PLUS ONE IS TWO
YES LOGIC IS THE ROCK OF OUR FOUNDATION

I SUSPECT
(AND I’M NEVER INCORRECT)
THAT YOU’RE FAR TOO OLD TO GIVE IN TO IMAGINATION

As she pours the soap bubbles into the bath a dolphin peaks
its head up out of the water much to the children’s
amazement To the dolphin

Not yet
Mary Poppins gently pushes the dolphin back underwater

SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SPLASH AND PLAY
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT

AND TAKE A SEASIDE HOLIDAY

CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT

Mary Poppins reaches into her bag to pull out a pail and
shovel and a rubber duck The children watch astonished

TOO MUCH GLEE

LEAVES RINGS AROUND THE BRAIN
TAKE THAT JOY

AND SEND IT DOWN THE DRAIN

As Mary Poppins drops each item into the tub they seem to be
magically drawn into the water as though rocketing down a
slide

SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO LAUGH AT LIFE
AND GIGGLE THROUGH THE DAY
THEY THINK THE WORLD’S A BRAND NEW SHINY TOY

She pulls a toy pirate ship out of her bag puts it into the
tub and it disappears then she sprinkles a handful of coins
into the water

MARY POPPINS (contd)
AND IF WHILE DREAMING IN THE CLOUDS
THEY FALL AND GO KERSPLAT

Mary Poppins searches in her bag for something snapping her
fingers when she suddenly remembers where it is She marches
over and pulls a large beach umbrella out of the sink with a
flourish then slides it into the tub as well

ALTHOUGH THEY’RE DOWN AND BENT IN HALF
THEY BRUSH RIGHT OFF AND START TO LAUGH
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT

On second thoughts perhaps you’re
right It makes no sense to have a
bath this early -

GEORGIE
I want to take a bath

MARY POPPINS
(Mildly surprised )
Oh really Very well then Up
you go and in you go

She sets Georgie on the edge of the tub He throws up his
arms and slides in - he too is magically drawn into the
water

JOHN
Georgie

John lunges forward grabbing Georgie’s hand at the last
possible moment - getting pulled into the water as well

ANNABEL
John

Annabel sweeps away soap bubbles and peers into the water
Georgie and John are nowhere to be seen

ANNABEL (contd)
What happened Will they be
alright

MARY POPPINS
It is just a bath after all But
then again it’s not my tub

ANNABEL
Shouldn’t you go after them

MARY POPPINS
I had my bath this morning thank
you

ANNABEL
Well if you won’t I will

Annabel climbs onto the back of the tub and slides in

Mary Poppins sits on the edge of the tub herself and slides
in backwards -

MARY POPPINS
Off we go

EXT BENEATH THE MAGICAL OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

Georgie the twins and Mary Poppins plummet past all of them
tumbling down into a magical ocean The toys Mary Poppins put
in the water have all grown to enormous size The rubber duck
is the size of a bus the pail and shovel are enormous

MARY POPPINS
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DIVE RIGHT IN
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT
AND FLAP ABOUT IN BATHTUB GIN
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT

Mary Poppins and the children float past increasingly surreal
scenes peopled by those they know from Cherry Tree Lane Miss
Lark passes by with her dog Willoughby on a leash the dog
towing her as he paddles through the water

DOGGIES PADDLING

TWENTY LEAGUES BELOW
MIGHT SEEM REAL

BUT WE KNOW IT’S NOT SO

The toy pirate ship has become a full-size shipwreck Ellen
can be seen through a hole in the ship’s hull trying to keep
the clams and minnows in her cooking pot from swimming away

TO COOK WITHOUT A RECIPE
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT
AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT LIVES WITHIN THAT POT

A treasure chest sits on a reef filled with the coins she
dropped in They swim down to it coins swirling around them
in a current

SOME PIRATES FOLLOW TREASURE MAPS
AND WEAR A SILLY HAT
THEY SEARCH THE WORLD FOR BURIED GOLD

Georgie veers away from the others diving through thick
seagrass He looks up The Park Keeper stands before him
pointing sternly to a sign “KEEP OFF THE SEAGRASS”

THEY WON’T GROW UP AND DON’T GROW OLD
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT

Mary Poppins grabs sponges from a colorful coral reef and
tosses them to the children

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Be sure to scrub behind your ears

Mary Poppins floats up toward the surface as a SCHOOL OF
DOLPHINS arrives and circles around the children creating a
whirlpool of bubbles When the dolphins swim off and the
bubbles clear the children are thoroughly scrubbed and
washed The children are captured in enormous bubbles one by
one they float to the surface

EXT THE MAGICAL OCEAN ABOVE THE WATER - CONTINUOUS

The bubbles lift out of the water to hover above Mary
Poppins who sits in their bathtub which is now floating on
an endless sea

Mary Poppins takes the beach umbrella which sits in the tub
and uses it to pop the children’s bubbles They all land in
the tub

MARY POPPINS
SOME ANSWER WHEN ADVENTURE CALLS

MARY POPPINS and CHILDREN
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT

Mary Poppins raises the umbrella for a sail handing it to
John

MARY POPPINS
AND SAIL STRAIGHT OVER WATERFALLS

MARY POPPINS and CHILDREN
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT

The Admiral and Binnacle float past them in a rowboat
MARY POPPINS
THEY SEE LIVING
AS IT’S OWN REWARD

ADMIRAL BOOM
Ahoy

MARY POPPINS
THEY ROCK THE BOAT THEN -—

The Admiral and Binnacle salute The children salute back
John is pulled off balance by the umbrella and falls in

ADMIRAL BOOM
- MAN OVERBOARD

Mary Poppins and the children reel John back onboard

MARY POPPINS
SOME PEOPLE LOOK OUT ON THE SEA
AND SEE A BRAND NEW DAY
THEIR SPIRIT LIFTS THEM HIGH
ABOVE THE BLUE
Yet
SOME OTHERS WEAR AN ANCHOR
AND THEY SINK IN SECONDS FLAT
So
PERHAPS WE’VE LEARNT WHEN DAY IS DONE
SOME STUFF AND NONSENSE COULD BE
FUN

MARY POPPINS and CHILDREN
CAN YOU I-MA-GINE THAT

Mary Poppins pulls the string of the bathtub stopper Water
rushes up through the drain and a whirlpool opens up beneath
the tub Everyone tumbles about as the tub spins down into
the yawning vortex spinning faster and faster

MATCH CUT TO

INT THE BATHROOM - DAY

water swirling down the drain The children are back in
the bathroom wrapped in towels All that’s left in the tub
is the toy duck The children watch in mute awe as Mary
Poppins picks it up and slips into her carpetbag closing the
latch just as the song ends

INT THE PARLORTHE LIBRARY - DAY

Michael pulls books off of shelves searching for the shares
document Aunt Jane looks through the bottom drawer of the
secretary desk pulling out stacks of pencil drawings
Michael turns to Aunt Jane

MICHAEL
Anything

AUNT JANE
No just your drawings and bills -
and nothing else

MICHAEL
(After a beat )
Then it’s not here

The children can be heard coming downstairs as Michael takes
the drawings from Aunt Jane and tosses them onto the floor

THE CHILDREN (0S)
(Overlapping )
Father Aunt Jane You wont
believe it It was incredible

The children appear in the doorway Mary Poppins behind them

GEORGIE
We went sailing

MICHAEL
Not now please -

JOHN
But it really happened Tell them
Mary Poppins

MARY POPPINS
I have no idea what you’re all
talking about

GEORGIE
We swam through a pirate ship -

MICHAEL
Enough - PLEASE

The children’s wonder has faded in an instant

ANNABEL
Youre right father We’re sorry

She takes Georgie’s hand and turns to go

MICHAEL
(Contrite )
No wait - I’m sorry I don’t mean
to be cross with all of you I’ve
just lost something very important

AUNT JANE
And well find it I’m sure your
grandfather just tucked it away
somewhere for safekeeping -
(A realization )
The bank Didn’t father have a
safety deposit box in the bank

MICHAEL
Yes he did

AUNT JANE
Well let’s go

MICHAEL
It’s closed

AUNT JANE
Well go first thing in the
morning

MICHAEL

Won’t we need a key

AUNT JANE
There’s a whole drawer full of keys
up in father’s desk

MICHAEL
Is there

AUNT JANE
Yes

Michael and Aunt Jane hurry out of the room Mary Poppins
shakes her head dismayed at the mess they’ve left behind

MARY POPPINS
My goodness gracious glory me
Youd think by now they’d have
learned to pick up after themselves

As she picks up a piece of paper and drops it into the
rubbish bin the other papers on the floor magically RISE
INTO THE AIR swirl around the room then collect themselves
together and fall neatly into the rubbish bin ONE FINAL
DRAWING lands gently on top of the rest

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Cleaning is not a spectator sport
I’1l remind you John Annabel put
all the books back on the shelves -
(Handing Georgie the bin)
- Georgie Banks come back here
Take out this rubbish would you

GEORGIE
Yes Mary Poppins

MARY POPPINS
There’s a good boy Off you go
spit spot

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

As Georgie struggles to carry the bin he pauses to look at
the final drawing that landed in the pile which shows a

playful depiction of the house in happier times when mother
was still alive

In the drawing Father stands in front of the house with his
arms around John and Annabel and mother cradles Georgie in
her arms Everyone beams with happiness Georgie takes the
drawing out of the bin folds it and puts it in his pocket

EXT THE BANK —- DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT - The next morning It is raining a sea of
black umbrellas swirl along the sidewalk outside the bank

INT THE BANK VAULT — DAY

CLOSE on a safety deposit box Michael flips through a small
stack papers as Aunt Jane watches He finds nothing

MICHAEL
Well That’s that

Michael puts everything back into the box and gestures for a
BANK OFFICER to lock it away again

AUNT JANE
What about Mr Dawes Jr Couldnt
he give you more time

MICHAEL
I’m sure he would if he were still
here Dawes’ nephew has been
running things lately I’m not even
sure he knows who I am

AUNT JANE
(She rises heading for
the door )
Well it’s high time he finds out
don’t you think

MICHAEL
Jane - Jane

INT THE BANK MAIN FLOOR -— CONTINUOUS

By the time Michael leaves the vault Aunt Jane is halfway
across the bank He tries to get Aunt Jane’s attention as she
strides up the staircase at the far end of the main floor

MICHAEL
(Whispered )
Jane Jane

INT OUTSIDE MR WILKINS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

MICHAEL
We can’t just charge into his
office

Aunt Jane arrives at the desk of MISS PENNY FARTHING (30s)
Mr Wilkins’ receptionist Michael is not far behind

AUNT JANE
Hello Miss
(Off her name plaque )
Penny Farthing is it Heavens
did the old secretary finally
retire

AUNT JANE (contd)
She always had that jar of sweets
on the desk that we would raid as
children -

MR WILKINS (50s patrician sporting a thin waxed mustache)
sticks his head out of his office a kindly smile on his face

WILKINS
I remember that jar - with those
little toffees that stuck your
teeth together We must get you one
of those jars Miss Farthing

MISS FARTHING
Of course sir

WILKINS
This wouldn’t happen to be your
sister would it Mr Banks

AUNT JANE
Yes - Jane Banks How do you do

They shake hands

WILKINS
Great pleasure to meet you --
William Weatherall Wilkins
(Waving them in)
Do step this way

Michael blinks surprised Aunt Jane smiles

INT WILKINS’ OFFICE - DAY

A SHORT TIME LATER Wilkins sits at the desk examining
paperwork as Michael and Aunt Jane look on He has an
enormous office with a roaring fireplace and a view of Big
Ben out the window behind his desk

WILKINS
If I had known George Banks’ son had
taken a loan with us I’d have handled
the paperwork myself Unfortunately
regarding the extension there’s very
little I can do at this point

MICHAEL
Our father did leave us shares in
the bank

This is news to Wilkins He looks up smiling with interest

WILKINS
Oh well that is good news

AUNT JANE
Yes it is but the trouble is we
can’t seem to find the share
certificate

MICHAEL
You wouldn’t happen to have any
record of our father’s shares would
you

WILKINS
I would think so

(Tapping his intercom )
Would you bring in the
shareholder’s ledger Miss
Farthing

MISS FARTHING (INTERCOM)
Right away Mr Wilkins

AUNT JANE
What about your uncle Mr Dawes
Jr He would know if our father
received shares wouldn’t he

Wilkins sighs gesturing to a portrait of his uncle

WILKINS
I’m afraid dear old Uncle Dawes is
getting on in years
(He taps his temple)

“Non compos mentis - which sadly
is why I had to take over for him
Ah - thank you Miss Farthing

Miss Farthing has entered She hands Wilkins the ledger and
leaves Wilkins flips pages runs a finger along the columns

WILKINS (contd)

Let’s see Babcock Baker hmm
There’s no listing of George Banks
here But don’t despair

(Pointing out the window

to Big Ben )
You still have until that big fellow
out there chimes his last on Friday
night to find that certificate I’1ll
keep searching here as well

Aunt Jane and Michael rise

MICHAEL
Thank you so much Mr Wilkins

They shake hands As Michael and Aunt Jane head to the door

AUNT JANE
Yes thank you It was such a
pleasure to meet you

Michael and Aunt Jane leave Wilkins absently takes out his
pocket watch swinging it He hits his intercom button

WILKINS
Bring me all of George Banks’ old
files would you

MISS FARTHING (INTERCOM)
Of course Mr Wilkins

Wilkins walks round to his chair swinging his pocket-watch
and reopens the ledger He turns to a page with the name
GEORGE BANKS written in bold letters He tears the page out
and tosses it into the flames

INT THE NURSERY - EVENING

The children are already in bedclothes and robes when Mary
Poppins enters carrying a neatly-folded pile of children’s
clothing She sees Georgie jumping on the bed

MARY POPPINS
Georgie This is a nursery let me
remind you not a music hall

GEORGIE
Can we have another bath

MARY POPPINS
Oh pish posh
(Turning )
John youd best go downstairs and -

CRASH From downstairs comes the sound of breaking glass

MARY POPPINS (contd)
- help Ellen put away the dishes

JOHN
Yes Mary Poppins

He goes Mary Poppins heads for the wardrobe Annabel
intercepts her reaching for the clothes

ANNABEL
Here - I can put those away myself

MARY POPPINS
Very well

Mary Poppins glances to the broken kite which leans against
Georgie’s bed Sternly

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Georgie Banks - if you’re hoping
I’ll let you take this sadly-
neglected kite to the park
tomorrow you had better start
patching it up this instant

GEORGIE
(Smiling )
Yes Mary Poppins

INT DINING ROOM - EVENING

Ellen is on a chair doing her best to put dishes on a high
shelf in the china cabinet John enters just as Ellen is
about to drop them

JOHN
Here - let me help you with those

ELLEN

Oh - there’s a good lad Such a
help you are

(She kicks the broken

plates away )
I only wish I could do somethin’ to
‘elp your father save this old
house

(A beat She considers )
I could sell my broach and
necklace I suppose - matching set
my old mum gave ‘em to me

Ellen picks up a large platter and holds it out to John

JOHN
Youd do that for us

Ellen pulls the platter away and holds it to her chest

ELLEN
What Sell my prized possessions

JOHN
Oh no I didn’t mean it like that

ELLEN
Oh don’t worry
(She hands him the
platter Confidentially )

I think they’re fakes anyway
(hands over serving bowl)
There’s plenty in this house worth

more than them old trinkets

John stares at the china soup tureen he’s holding He quickly
passes it back to Ellen and rushes out of the room

JOHN
If you’ll excuse me Ellen -

ELLEN
What’s got into ‘im

INT THE NURSERY - EVENING

Georgie sits on his bed Gillie at his side He uses scissors
to cut up his father’s drawing of the family and patches his
kite with the pieces Annabel is putting toys back in the toy
chest when John comes rushing back in

JOHN
(With quiet urgency )
Annabel - I know how to save the house

ANNABEL
What do you mean

Mary Poppins enters from her room crossing to shut the
drapes

MARY POPPINS
If you two are going to keep up all
this whispering I would like you
to practice doing so as loudly as
possible It will still be bad
manners but at least then we’1l
all be in on the secret

Mary Poppins notices Jack polishing one of the brass lamps on
the front portico of the house She opens the window

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Hello Jack

Jack smiles He swings himself up onto the portico climbs
along the ledge to the nursery window and onto the balcony

JACK
Mary Poppins How are you this fine
evening

MARY POPPINS
Settling in quite nicely thank you

JACK
(Climbing up )
Yknow when I was a lad I used to
wave up to the boy and girl who
lived here

MARY POPPINS
You mean Michael and Jane

JACK
Miss Jane Banks that’s right I
see Mr Banks about now and again -
it’s been ages since I’ve seen her

Now that Mary Poppins’ back is turned John taps Annabel on
the shoulder and hurries over to the mantelpiece They talk
in whispers

MARY POPPINS
She lives in a flat on the other
side of town now I’m sure you’1ll
bump into her one of these days

Across the room John takes the china bowl off the
mantelpiece It has an illustration of an autumn scene in a
park with leaves falling from the trees A carriage drives
along a winding path A CLYDESDALE HORSE in mid-gallop is
hitched to the carriage We see the COACHMAN from the back
he wears a top hat and high collar and holds a whip in his
hand

ANNABEL
(Whispering )
What are you doing We’re not
supposed to touch that

JOHN
(Looking closely at the
bowl )
This is authentic Royal Doulton
china Annabel Mother always said
it was priceless and I bet it’1ll
be enough to pay off father’s debt

Annabel grabs the bowl off John He grabs it back from her

ANNABEL
That’s a terrible idea John
Mother loved that bowl

JOHN
But she’d sell it herself to save
the house

Georgie sees John holding the bowl and hurries over

GEORGIE
That was mother’s - put that back
(Grabbing for the bowl)
Put it back

ANNABEL
Here - give it to me

Jack now sits on the windowsill chatting with Mary Poppins
He lowers his voice leaning in

JACK
It’s a good thing you come along
when you did Mary Poppins

As they tussle the bowl slips and hits the floor cracking
it and breaking a wedge-shaped piece from the rim

JACK (contd)

(Wincing )
That didn’t sound good now did it

John picks up the bowl Mary Poppins doesn’t turn

MARY POPPINS
What are the three of you up to

The children look at one another in a panic John looks at
the bowl and sees a piece missing

JOHN
(An urgent whisper )
Give me the missing piece

ANNABEL
I haven’t got it

JOHN
Well look for it then

John places the bowl back on the mantelpiece

MARY POPPINS
Which of you broke the bowl

The three turn back around Mary Poppins stands before them
Jack behind her She holds the missing piece in her hand

JOHN
Georgie did

GEORGIE
I did not It was Annabel

ANNABEL
If John hadn’t taken it off the
mantel
The children all starting arguing at the same time
A voice comes from the bowl behind them
1ST VOICE (HORSE - 0S)
(Working-class accent )

Actually it was all three of them

The children turn bewildered glancing over to the door and
the window wondering where the voices came from

JOHN
Who said that

Mary Poppins walks up and peers at the bowl

MARY POPPINS
Oh dear

They all peer at the bowl THE ILLUSTRATION HAS CHANGED - the
crack has caused one of the carriage wheels to fall off and
the carriage has tipped onto its axle The Horse now stares
directly out of the bowl at the children while the Coachman
peers down at the broken wheel

ANNABEL
Look - the picture’s changed

We see Mary Poppins and the group peering into the bowl from
the horses’ “fish-eye lens” point of view

MARY POPPINS
It looks as though they’ve broken
your carriage wheel

2ND VOICE (COACHMAN - OS)
(Irish accent )
That they have It’s useless now

HORSE (0S)
Useless as a chocolate teapot

JOHN
The bowl is speaking

COACHMAN (0S)
And who do we think is going to fix
that

JACK
Ay there’s the riddle Them what
broke it fixes it That’s what I
say What do you think Mary
Poppins

MARY POPPINS
(Irritated )
I suppose we have no choice

JOHN
(Wide-eyed )
But how are we going to do that

JACK
I know a bit about fixing carriages

ANNABEL
We can’t fix their carriage wheel
It isn’t possible

MARY POPPINS
Everything is possible - even the
impossible

Mary Poppins takes the bowl sets it on a small table in the
center of the nursery and presses the missing piece back in
place

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Now gather ‘round everyone - spit
spot

They do so

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Georgie don’t forget Gillie Are
we ready

The children watch in astonishment as Mary Poppins SPINS THE
BOWL on the table Colorful leaves fly out of the bowl in all
directions filling the air and swirling around everyone
covering them completely When the leaves fall away they
find themselves in

EXT A PATH THROUGH THE PARK (ANIMATED) - DAY

the ANIMATED WORLD of the Doulton china bowl Jack and
the children are stunned to discover they’re now wearing turn-
of-the-century dress Mary Poppins holds an elegant parasol
While they are still very much real everything around them
is animated

GEORGIE
Wow

JOHN
What just happened

ANNABEL
Where are we

Jack lifts a finger tapping the air behind him - we hear the
‘tink tink of his finger against the bowl

JACK
Looks like we’re in China so to
speak
Mary Poppins slides down a porcelain slope to the carriage
MARY POPPINS
Over here everyone - this wheel

wont fix itself

The others manage the slope much less gracefully

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Tread lightly please - this is
fine porcelain we don’t want to
chip the glaze

Georgie loses his balance completely and tumbles down to the
others

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Oh Georgie - head up and feet
beneath you
(Turning to the carriage )
Excuse me driver would you help
us

The Coachman turns The children see that he’s actually an
IRISH SETTER in uniform

JACK
(Shrugs )
One thing you should know about
Mary Poppins - she never explains

anything

WOLF (0OS)
Hurry hurry - only a few seats

A WOLF with a thin waxed mustache acts as barker swinging
his pocket watch in a manner that makes him look suspiciously
like Wilkins A BADGER and a WEASEL selling tickets behind

him look remarkably like Gooding and Frye

WOLF (contd)
Get tickets while you can for the
one-night only one and only -

Four “familiar” PENGUINS peak their heads out from the center
split of the stage curtains

PENGUINS
Please Mary Poppins Please

MARY POPPINS
No I couldn’t possibly
(To the orangutan
CONDUCTOR )
D Flat Major

As she steps into the spotlight the curtains part just
enough to reveal a large open book that acts as a dressing
screen with a bowler hat and hooked cane hanging on it The
penguins push the set forward as Mary Poppins steps behind
the screen and transforms into character

“AR COVER IS NOT THE BOOK”

MARY POPPINS (contd)
UNCLE GUTENBERG WAS A BOOKWORM
AND HE LIVED ON CHARING CROSS
THE MEMORY OF HIS VOLUMES
BRINGS A SMILE

HE WOULD READ ME LOTS OF STORIES
WHEN HE WASNT ON THE SAUCE

NOW ID LIKE TO SHARE THE WISDOM
OF MY FAVORITE BIBLIOPHILE

HE SAID

The dressing screen flies out revealing Mary Poppins in full
costume The stage curtains open fully revealing a set
composed of piles of enormous books

A COVER IS NOT THE BOOK

PENGUIN 1
Mary Poppins could you give us an example

MARY POPPINS
Certainly

An oversized book on stage magically opens creating a
Victorian “Pop-Up” set on which she performs

NELLIE RUBINA WAS MADE OF WOOD

BUT WHAT COULD NOT BE SEEN

WAS THOUGH HER TRUNK UP TOP WAS BARREN
WELL HER ROOTS WERE LUSH AND GREEN

SO IN SPRING WHEN MR HICK’RY

SAW HER BLOSSOMS BLOOMIN’ THERE

HE TOOK ROOT (DESPITE HER BARK)

AND NOW THERES SEEDLINGS EVERYWHERE

Jack slides down a book and joins her in the song and dance

MARY POPPINS
Give us the one about the “Dirty
Rascal” why don’t you

JACK
(Aside worried )
Isn’t that one a bit long

MARY POPPINS
Well the quicker you’re into it
the quicker you’re out of it

The final “Pop-Up” book opens Mary Poppins turns to the
Conductor tapping her cane on the stage in double time The
tempo gets very fast Jack wide-eyed launches into a
“period rap” of sorts as he scales the set

JACK
ONCE UPON A TIME IN A NURSERY RHYME THERE WAS A
CASTLE WITH A KING HIDING IN A WING CAUSE HE
NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL TO LEARN A SINGLE THING
HE HAD SCEPTERS AND SWORDS AND A PARLIAMENT OF
LORDS BUT ON THE INSIDE HE WAS SAD EGAD
BECAUSE HE NEVER HAD

A WISDOM FOR NUMBERS A WISDOM FOR WORDS THOUGH
HIS CROWN WAS QUITE IMMENSE HIS BRAIN WAS
SMALLER THAN A BIRDS

JACK (contd)
SO THE QUEEN OF THE NATION MADE A ROYAL
PROCLAMATION TO THE MISSUS AND THE MESSERS
THE MORE OR LESSERS BRING ME ALL THE LAND’S
PROFESSORS THEN SHE WENT TO THE HAIR DRESSERS

AND THEY CAME FROM THE EAST AND THEY CAME FROM
THE SOUTH FROM EACH COLLEGE THEY POURED
KNOWLEDGE FROM THEIR BRAINS INTO HIS MOUTH

BUT THE KING COULDNT LEARN SO EACH PROFESSOR
MET THEIR FATE FOR THE QUEEN HAD THEIR HEADS
REMOVED AND PLACED UPON THE GATE AND ON THAT
DATE I STATE THEIR WIVES ALL GOT A NOTE THEIR
MATE WAS NOW THE LATE GREAT

BUT THEN SUDDENLY ONE DAY A STRANGER STARTED IN
TO SING HE SAID IM THE DIRTY RASCAL AND IM
HERE TO TEACH THE KING”

AND THE QUEEN CLUTCHED HER JEWELS FOR SHE HATED
ROYAL FOOLS BUT THIS FOOL HAD SOME RULES THEY
REALLY OUGHT TO TEACH IN SCHOOLS

LIKE YOULL BE A HAPPY KING IF YOU ENJOY THE
THINGS YOUVE GOT YOU SHOULD NEVER TRY TO BE
THE KIND OF PERSON THAT YOURE NOT

SO THEY SANG AND THEY LAUGHED FOR THE KING HAD
FOUND A FRIEND AND THEY RAN ONTO A RAINBOW FOR
THE STORY’S PERFECT END

SO THE MORAL IS YOU MUSTN’T LET THE OUTSIDE BE
THE GUIDE FOR ITS NOT SO CUT AND DRIED WELL

UNLESS ITS DR JEKYLL THEN YOU BETTER HIDE

PETRIFIED

NO THE TRUTH CANT BE DENIED AS
I HAVE NOW HAVE TESTIFIED ALL
THAT REALLY COUNTS AND MATTERS
IS THE SPECIAL STUFF INSIDE

Jack reaches the top of the set as the audience cheers

AUDIENCE
Hooray He did it

Mary Poppins bursts through the back of the pop-up set
rejoining Jack and leading the Penguins and a CHORUS LINE OF
DANCING ANIMALS down a grand staircase

MARY POPPINS JACK and ALL
OH A COVER IS NOT THE BOOK
SO OPEN IT UP AND TAKE A LOOK
CAUSE UNDER THE COVERS ONE DISCOVERS

The crowd cheers In the audience Georgie notices that
Gillie is gone He looks around the Wolf is CASTING A LARGE
SHADOW onto the canvas wall of the tent as he swings his
pocket watch outside The shadows of the Badger and the
Weasel come into view as they cross back and forth carrying
things Georgie recognizes one of the items as Gillie

GEORGIE
Gillie

As Mary and Jack take their bows Annabel suddenly realizes
that Georgie is gone

ANNABEL
Where’s Georgie

JOHN
I don’t know

They look over just as he leaves through a tent flap They
panic and rush after him

EXT BEHIND THE MUSIC HALL TENT (ANIMATED) - NIGHT

Georgie comes out of the tent The Wolf Badger and Weasel

stand near a period moving van - a motorized cab with an old-
fashioned steam engine that pulls a slatted wagon

They are loading the wagon with all the real belongings from
the children’s nursery (not animated)

GEORGIE
What are you doing

WOLF
Well well - if it isn’t the boy
who cracked the bowl We’ve waited
a long time for you Banks children
to come and visit us - so we could
pay a visit to your nursery

GEORGIE
But those are our things

WOLF
Not anymore they aren’t

GEORGIE
Give Gillie back

Georgie rushes at the wagon grabbing Gillie out of the back
The Badger tries to grab it back but Georgie won’t let go

GEORGIE (contd)
He’s mine My mother made him for
me

John and Annabel run out from the tent shouting

ANNABEL
Hey Leave our brother alone

The Wolf cranks the engine and climbs into the cab

WOLF
Time to go boys
The Badger and the Weasel throw boy and giraffe together into
the wagon They slam the slatted door and jump into the cab
The moving van roars off through the back gates engulfing
Annabel and John in exhaust smoke

GEORGIE
Annabel Help John

ANNABEL AND JOHN
Georgie

John and Annabel chase after Georgie

EXT DARKER PATHS THROUGH THE PARK (ANIMATED) - NIGHT

down far darker more ominous paths than the lovely
cobblestone road that led up to the gates

JOHN
We’re coming Georgie

GEORGIE
(Shouts )
Let me go I want to go home

WOLF
(Calling back )
What home You’ve lost your home

The twins give chase but the moving van is getting away -
they slow down exhausted when suddenly the carriage driven
by the Coachman appears out of the shadows behind them

John and Annabel gasp

A hand reaches down and pulls them into the carriage Seamus
turns around to them

ANNABEL
Shamus

JOHN
Clyde

COACHMAN

That’s right - it’s us

HORSE
Let’s go get your brother back

The chase is on The two vehicles screech and slide on the
china’s glazed surface

COACHMAN
We’re gaining on them

WOLF
Give it more speed

The Badger shovels more coal into the steam engine As the
van banks up the side of the bowl Georgie is thrown to the
side of the tipping wagon The carriage is closing in

COACHMAN
Giddy up big fella

The carriage tips and drives up the side of the bowl The
Wolf swerves left and right cutting them off The carriage
closes the gap

COACHMAN (contd)
(To horse )
Almost there

John reaches out to Georgie

JOHN
Georgie

The carriage manages to pull alongside the moving van The
twins ready themselves

JOHN (contd)
READY AND - NOW

- and they leap onto the wagon

COACHMAN
Well done children

HORSE
Give ‘em what for

The carriage recedes into the distance

WOLF
Get rid of them

WEASEL
But sir -

WOLF

You heard me

The Weasel and the Badger climb out and crawl towards the
children

John and Annabel look down at Georgie

ANNABEL
Oh Georgie Are you alright

John looks up

JOHN
Annabel look

Annabel turns and sees the Badger and Weasel closing in She
reaches down grabs a cricket bat from the nursery belongings
and swings at the Weasel The bat misses them and goes
flying chipping the bowl The chip hits the Badger who
slams into the Weasel knocking both off the wagon

JOHN (contd)
(To Annabel )
Stay with Georgie

Annabel lowers herself into the wagon She hugs Georgie They
watch as John crawls forward

ANNABEL
Be careful

GEORGIE
What are you doing

John pulls out the pin detaching the wagon from the cab

ANNABEL
He did it

John makes his way along the bar back towards the wagon and
climbs into the carriage

The Wolf grabs the stoking shovel and swings it hard hitting
the bowl and creating a deep crack in the bowl which travels
towards the children’s wagon

The wagon wheel hits the crack which splinters off They fly
up the side of the bowl like a runaway roller coaster The
Wolf loses control of the cab and careens off a bridge into
the water

The frightened children see an ominous sign ahead “Caution
Edge of Bowl”

ANNABEL (contd)
OH NO

THE CHILDREN
THE EDGE OF THE BOWL

The children scream as the wagon flies off the edge They
fall into space twisting and turning in slow motion

END OF ANIMATION
SEQUENCE
INT THE NURSERY - NIGHT

Georgie is in his bed back in his nightclothes again He
tosses and turns in his sleep Mary Poppins sits next to him

MARY POPPINS
It’s alright Georgie it’s
alright You were been having a
nice sort of nightmare I must say

Mary Poppins turns on his bedside lamp

GEORGIE
You were right Mary Poppins A
cover is not the book We thought
they were nice but they were mean

MARY POPPINS
Whatever are you talking about

GEORGIE
They tried to take Gillie

MARY POPPINS
Gillie is right here sleeping - as
you should be

She moves the giraffe next to Georgie

GEORGIE
But it was real They stole all our
things and the wolf said we were
never going to see our home again

MARY POPPINS
That’s absurd

Mary Poppins stands goes to shut the window She sees Jack
cycling away outside he waves up to her as he goes John and
Annabel climb out of their beds awake as well

JOHN
But I had a nightmare like that
too

ANNABEL

(Turning on light)
So did I It seemed awfully real

GEORGIE
I don’t want to lose our home

Georgie moves over and sits on Annabel’s bed cuddling
Gillie

JOHN
You see Georgie That’s why we
wanted mother’s bowl we were going
to sell it to save the house

GEORGIE
(After a beat)
I miss mother

The room falls silent Something flickers ever so briefly in
Mary Poppins’ eyes and then she speaks

MARY POPPINS
Listen to the three of you You’re
all worrying far too much After
all you can’t lose what you’ve
never lost

GEORGIE
I don’t understand

“THE PLACE WHERE LOST THINGS GO

MARY POPPINS

DO YOU EVER LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT

JUST BETWEEN THE DARK AND THE MORNING LIGHT

MARY POPPINS (contd)
SEARCHING FOR THE THINGS YOU USED TO KNOW
LOOKING FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE LOST THINGS GO

DO YOU EVER DREAM OR REMINISCE

WONDERING WHERE TO FIND WHAT YOU TRULY MISS

WELL MAYBE ALL THOSE THINGS THAT YOU LOVE SO

ARE WAITING IN THE PLACE WHERE THE LOST THINGS GO

MEMORIES YOUVE SHARED

GONE FOR GOOD YOU FEARED
THEYRE ALL AROUND YOU STILL
THOUGH THEYVE DISAPPEARED
NOTHINGS REALLY LEFT

OR LOST WITHOUT A TRACE
NOTHINGS GONE FOREVER

ONLY OUT OF PLACE

Mary Poppins puts John back to bed and tucks him in She
tucks Annabel into her bed

SO MAYBE NOW THE DISH AND MY BEST SPOON

ARE PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK JUST BEHIND THE MOON
WAITING THERE UNTIL ITS TIME TO SHOW

SPRING IS LIKE THAT NOW FAR BENEATH THE SNOW
HIDING IN THE PLACE WHERE THE LOST THINGS GO

Mary Poppins takes Georgie’s hand and leads him back to bed

Now time to get some sleep And in
the morning bright and early
well take that bowl to my cousin
and have it mended

(She tucks Georgie in)

TIME TO CLOSE YOUR EYES

SO SLEEP CAN COME AROUND

FOR WHEN YOU DREAM YOULL FIND
ALL THATS LOST IS FOUND

MAYBE ON THE MOON

OR MAYBE SOMEWHERE NEW

MAYBE ALL YOURE MISSING

LIVES INSIDE OF YOU

SO WHEN YOU NEED HER TOUCH AND LOVING GAZE
GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN IS THE PERFECT PHRASE

Mary Poppins walks over to the window looking out toward a
bright star in the night sky

SMILING FROM A STAR THAT SHE MAKES GLOW
TRUST SHES ALWAYS THERE WATCHING AS YOU GROW
FIND HER IN THE PLACE WHERE THE LOST THINGS GO

Mary Poppins walks out of the nursery closing the pocket
doors that lead to her room Annabel gets up crossing to
look out the window at the star

After a moment she turns to go back to bed but then she
notices the bowl on the mantelpiece She peers at it her
eyes growing wide

ANNABEL
(Quiet wonder )
John look Mary Poppins’ scarf
It wasn’t a dream after all

John crosses to Annabel’s side She points at the carriage on
the bowl Mary Poppins scarf is tied around the broken
wheel John is amazed

JOHN
Shall we tell her

ANNABEL
Wed better not I expect she
already knows

INT MARY POPPINS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mary Poppins peers into the nursery through the glass in the
pocket doors having quietly listened to this last exchange
Satisfied she steps away from the doors

Ahoy fair lady

AUNT JANE

She turns back around just as Jack slides down the lamp pole
The two collide Aunt Jane’s flyers going everywhere

AUNT JANE (contd)
OH

JACK

He scrambles to help her pick them up

AUNT JANE
Oh it’s alright - thank you -

Mary Poppins appears at the nursery window above

MARY POPPINS
Good morning Jane - I see you’ve
bumped into Jack The children and
I are heading into town to get
something fixed Would you like to
come with us

AUNT JANE
Work calls I’m afraid We have a

MARY POPPINS
That’s right You ought to give
Jack one of those flyers

Mary Poppins disappears from the window As Jack continues
rescuing Aunt Jane’s flyers

JACK
Youre Miss Banks aren’t you I
don’t know if you remember me but
I used to wave to you when I’d see
you up there in that very window

In the background Ellen peers through the letter box

AUNT JANE
(Smiling )
Why yes - Jack I remember Call
me Jane please

JACK
‘Course I was much younger then -

AUNT JANE
True - but your smile hasn’t
changed a bit
(She hands him a flyer)

INT THE BANKS FRONT ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Ellen is still peering out through the letter box at Jack and
Aunt Jane when Mary Poppins comes down the stairs carrying
the Royal Doulton bowl in a cloth bag She comes up behind
Ellen

MARY POPPINS
Polishing the keyhole

ELLEN
Look at that Miss Jane’s chattin’
with that ‘andsome lamplighter -

MARY POPPINS
And I say there are always other
ships

Michael rushes down the stairs with his briefcase panicked

MICHAEL
My alarm clock didn’t ring

MARY POPPINS
Oh dear - let me help you

Mary Poppins puts the bowl down on a side table and TAKES
MICHAELS BRIEFCASE handing it to Ellen Michael gets his
coat from the rack and puts it on while Mary Poppins
retrieves his hat and umbrella

MICHAEL

Mary Poppins hands him only his hat and umbrella

MARY POPPINS
You’re not late yet Off you go

Mary Poppins opens the door as Michael runs out

EXT THE HOUSE AT 17 CHERRY TREE LANE - CONTINUOUS

Michael hurries out the front door of the house barely
noticing Jack and Aunt Jane as he passes them An ELEGANT
WOMAN approaches from the opposite direction holding a piece
of paper with an address on it

AUNT JANE
Good morning Michael

MICHAEL
(Glancing back)
Hello - I have to run forgive me

AUNT JANE
Watch where you’re going

Michael nearly runs into the ELEGANT WOMAN on the sidewalk

MICHAEL
Sorry excuse me -

He dodges the woman and hurries off down the street

AUNT JANE
(shaking her head)
Michael

ELEGANT WOMAN
No it’s fine I’m looking for
number nineteen

AUNT JANE AND JACK
(together )
Just two doors down

They share a laugh

ELEGANT WOMAN
Many thanks Sincerely

As the Elegant Woman continues on her way Ellen rushes out
holding his briefcase followed by Mary Poppins carrying the
bowl and the children

ELLEN
Michael - your briefcase
(Too late He’s gone)
He’d leave his ‘ead on the
breakfast table if it weren’t
screwed on

MARY POPPINS
Here - I’ll take the briefcase The
children and I are heading that way
on an errand we can stop by the
bank afterwards

JACK
I’1ll give you a lift My rounds are
done

He turns his ladder sideways setting it astride and
fastening it to the rear fender of the bike He buckles it

up

MARY POPPINS
Wonderful

JACK
All aboard - come on

GEORGIE
On the bicycle

ANNABEL
But there are five of us We can’t
all fit

JOHN
The weight on those wheels alone -
Mary Poppins how much do you weigh

MARY POPPINS

JACK
(Quickly interceding)
Never you mind about that - it’s a
question of balance

Jack kicks off the bike guard as Mary Poppins puts the
briefcase in the front basket then holds the bicycle steady

JACK (contd)
(He lifts Annabel onto the
bike )
Annabel here and then John here

He balances them on one side of the ladder

ELLEN

bicycle along a city street

MARY POPPINS
Pull over right ahead Thank you

Jack stops at the entrance to a narrow alley Mary Poppins
takes the bowl as Jack helps the children off the bike

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Off we go jiggity-jog

EXT THE ALLEYWAY COUSIN TOPSY’S SHOP

They go down a narrow alleyway past a series of eccentric-
looking shops

JACK
Never noticed this alley before

MARY POPPINS
Clearly you’ve never had a Royal
Doulton bowl that wanted mending
(Gestures )
Straight ahead

They arrive at Topsy’s repair shop - a little house at the
end with a front door so low that everyone except Georgie
would have to duck to go inside

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Here we are

Annabel reads the sign that hangs above the little door

ANNABEL
“TOPOTREPOLOVSKY’S - All Repairs
Large and Small Fix-it Shop”

JACK
Looks as though it’s just a Small
Fix-it Shop today

MARY POPPINS
That’s just what we want The bowl
only needs a small fix after all

She raps on the door with the parrot head of her umbrella

PARROT UMBRELLA
So now my head is a door knocker I
suppose my beak might be useful for
opening cans -

MARY POPPINS
“Fuss fuss fuss” - don’t be so
dramatic

Mary Poppins raps on the door again hears nothing She
pushes the tip of the umbrella through the letter box

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Cousin Topsy

TOPSY (0OS)
(A strangely untraceable
Eastern European accent )
Mary Poppins - NO For the love of
all that is holy do not come in

MARY POPPINS
Don’t be so rude

TOPSY (0OS)
Please stay away - it is Second
Wednesday today

MARY POPPINS
Second Wednesday Oh dear Id
forgotten Still today or never -
that’s my motto

Mary Poppins forces the tip of the cane into the keyhole and
thwacks the parrot on the top of the head

PARROT UMBRELLA
Ouch

She twists the umbrella opening the lock and goes inside

MARY POPPINS
(To the others )
There we are

INT TOPSY’S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

They pass through the tiny door into a narrow entry hall the
workshop just ahead

MARY POPPINS
Follow me

TOPSY (0S)
(Annoyed )
So in you come You do not listen
to Topsy

Mary reaches the doorway to the workshop

Almost instantly the entire room begins to rotate FLIPPING
UPSIDE DOWN Nearly everything stays stuck in place

TOPSY (dramatic Bohemian a restorations artist of the
highest order) is at the top of a spiral staircase on the far
side of the room she grips the railings as the room spins

TOPSY (contd)
Oh no - it has begun

The room comes to a stop with the floor where the ceiling
should be Topsy now sits on the ceiling A chandelier juts
up like a fountain in the middle of the room

TOPSY (contd)
Now what do you want

MARY POPPINS
You have guests cousin You might
at least greet them at the door

TOPSY
And how am I to do that please
when I am down here up on the
ceiling

MARY POPPINS
(With a sigh )
Very well we will come to you
Excuse me please Georgie
(To the children )
Now this way please Be very
careful on the way - up

Mary Poppins makes her way gracefully down the piles of
broken things the children and Jack following her

TOPSY
Why be careful Leave it all for
Topsy to fix Climb on my shelves
step on the toys kick the little
china dolls in their faces -

MARY POPPINS

MARY POPPINS
(Cuts her off )
We have no idea
(Taking the bowl)
We need you to fix this bowl dear

TOPSY
(Reeling back )
No no no no -

TOPSY (contd)
It is as I have told to you the
second Wednesday of the month when
everything is turning turtle

ANNABEL
Turning turtle What exactly does
that mean

TOPSY
It means my whole world goes
flippity-flop like a turtle on its
back and I don’t know my up from my
down my East from my West -
(Flirting with Jack)
- my Topsy from my bottom-sy -

MARY POPPINS
Yes I think we’ve all grasped the
concept

TOPSY
Oh good That’s quick for you

Topsy picks up an instrument that has been badly repaired and
shows it to the children

TOPSY (contd)
You see my little ones Anything I
fix on Second Wednesday goes
kerflooey

MARY POPPINS
(Rolling her eyes)
Kerflooey

TOPSY
(Nods grim )

Topsy throws the instrument across the room

MARY POPPINS

TOPSY
(Turning to Annabel )
Sweet girl - you tell Mary Poppins

day Tatiana Antanasia Cositori

drums Mary Poppins conducts Topsy dances like a whirling
dervish Soon they are all dancing As the music builds
Topsy floats up in the air and lands on her head upside down

Topsy reaches for the bowl Jack hands it to her

TOPSY
Come Give your bowl to me No more

view

MARY POPPINS
Good

JOHN
(To Topsy )
Excuse me but do you have any idea
how much our bowl might be worth

TOPSY
In money
(She looks at the bowl
considers for a moment )
Not very much I’m afraid But that
doesn’t make it any less beautiful

ANNABEL
But our mother said it was
priceless

TOPSY
Yes I am sure it was - to her

Disappointment is visible in the eyes of all three children

TOPSY (contd)
Mary Poppins is right - for once
It is all in the way you look at
things

MARY POPPINS
Thank you cousin Now come along
children Get your hats

The children all collect their hats and head out

TOPSY
And don’t you worry about mother’s
bowl I will fix and make perfect
for you So you come back maybe

catchy

EXT THE ALLEYWAY COUSIN TOPSY’S SHOP - DAY

Mary Poppins and Jack come out of the alleyway the children
lagging behind the twins talking quietly to one another

ANNABEL
Now what do we do

JOHN
I have no idea

ANNABEL
Well like Topsy said maybe we
should start looking at things
differently -

Everyone looks back as they hear LOUD CREAKS AND CRASHES
coming from inside Topsy’s shop Mary Poppins turns back and
continues walking

MARY POPPINS
Marvelous It looks as though
things are starting to turn around
for my cousin

EXT A STREET NEAR THE BANK - DAY
Jack Mary Poppins and the children ride down the street
JOHN
Mary Poppins this is not the
quickest way to the bank
MARY POPPINS
(Curtly )
Well it is today

GEORGIE
Look there’s Aunt Jane

THE CHILDREN
Aunt Jane

Aunt Jane walks just ahead carrying arm-loads of rally
posters and banners Jack pulls over the children waving

MARY POPPINS
Off to the rally are you Jane

AUNT JANE
Yes - hello everyone All still
here thank goodness No one fell
off

JACK
Say I could come back and give you
a hand with all that once I’ve
dropped the others at the bank

AUNT JANE
Oh no no - please don’t worry I’m
perfectly fine Really

MARY POPPINS
Oh nonsense The bank is just
around the corner and the children
and I have plenty of legs to get us
there Climb off everyone - ready
and - jump

They do Jack takes the banners and posters from Aunt Jane
tying them to the back of the bicycle

AUNT JANE
Are you sure you don’t mind Jack

JACK
Of course not I was hoping to stop
by that rally of yours anyway

AUNT JANE
You were Oh good

GEORGIE
You should ride up in the front
basket

JACK
I think she’ll be better here Up
you go now

AUNT JANE
Here is it Yes

Jack helps Aunt Jane sit side-saddle on the bar of the
bicycle in front of him

AUNT JANE (contd)
Where should I hold on

JACK
(To Aunt Jane )
Ready
AUNT JANE

Yes as ready as Ill ever be Oh-

Aunt Jane bursts out laughing holding on for dear life as
Jack pedals off down the street

Mary Poppins and the children watch them cycling away
together before Mary Poppins decides-—

MARY POPPINS
Right that’s enough

EXT THE BANK —- DAY

WIDE SHOT - Outside the bank is thronged with people as Mary
Poppins leads the children up the steps

MARY POPPINS
Step along children

INT THE BANK - CONTINUOUS

Inside the bank is a beehive of activity Mary Poppins
enters with the children and strides purposefully toward the
Information Desk the children hurrying to catch up

JOHN
(Walking with Annabel )
There must be someone at this bank
who could help us save our house

ANNABEL
I’m sure father has already asked

JOHN
Well we haven’t Maybe we can get
them to see things from a new point
of view

MARY POPPINS
Sit over there children

Mary Poppins guides the children over to a bench gestures
for them to sit then crosses to the INFORMATION DESK CLERK

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Good afternoon I’m looking for Mr-

A POSTMAN interrupts his arms full of parcels

POSTMAN
I’1l need a signature for these
sir

INFORMATION DESK CLERK
Of course - excuse me a moment

Mary Poppins purses her lips nettled As she waits she
adjusts her hat gazing into the reflection of a brass lamp

ON THE REFLECTION The children are visible Gooding and Frye
also appear having just entered the bank

Frye sees Georgie smiles and waves Georgie waves back
Annabel pointedly pushes Georgie’s hand down Frye’s smile
disappears his face clouds with guilt as he follows Gooding
upstairs

GEORGIE
(To Annabel )
What did you do that for You hurt
his feelings

ANNABEL
You do know who those men are
don’t you Georgie

GEORGIE
They’re the lawyers He’s the nice
one

A beat Annabel turns to John

ANNABEL
Maybe we could convince him to help
us

JOHN

Worth a try

(Glancing to the stairs)
Today or never That’s my motto
C’mon

ON THE REFLECTION Mary Poppins watches the children as they
lean in together clearly plotting something

The postman leaves and the clerk turns back to Mary Poppins

INFORMATION DESK CLERK
Now how may I help you

MARY POPPINS
Finally I’d like to see Mr Michael
Banks

ON THE REFLECTION the children sneak off

INT STAIRCASEOUTSIDE WILKINS’ OFFICE - DAY

The children hurry up the stairs following Gooding and Frye
who turn at the top of the steps and disappear around the
corner The children sneak around the corner in pursuit
spying on the lawyers as they go into Wilkins’ office Miss
Farthing sees them

MISS FARTHING
Is there something I can do for
you children

The twins freeze Georgie though sees the new jar of
toffees on Miss Farthing’s desk

GEORGIE

GOODING

amount scheduled for next week

WILKINS
Who would have thought this Slump
would be so good for business eh

FRYE
(Gathering his courage )
I wonder Mr Wilkins if perhaps
as Michael Banks is an employee
you might consider giving him a few
more weeks to pay off his loan

WILKINS
And lose our chance to get that
house I dont like to lose Mr
Frye
(Hitting the intercom )
Didn’t I ask for tea Miss Farthing

INTEXT WILKINS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

over to Wilkins door Annabel points to the sign on it

ANNABEL

(Whispering )
“Office of the Bank Chairman” We

can’t go in there

The children peer through the crack in the door listening

FRYE
(Nervously )
It’s just that well his family
has suffered tremendous hardship
this past year and -

WILKINS
You’re not giving Banks one second
longer to pay off that loan - do I
make myself clear

Wilkins swings his pocket watch From Georgie’s POV he can
see Wilkins’ shadow on the wall - as the firelight flickers
it changes into THE ANIMATED SHADOW HE SAW ON THE CIRCUS TENT
and back again

GEORGIE
Look

JOHN
SHHH

GEORGIE

It’s the wolf

WILKINS (0S)
In two days Banks will be out on
that street and the house will be

JOHN
Georgie no

GEORGIE
You can’t steal our house I’m
telling my father

WILKINS

Steal your - Who are you
FRYE

WILKINS

Come here boy I think you may

Miss Farthing backs in carrying a large tea tray

WILKINS
Close that door Miss Farthing

Georgie and the twins race past Miss Farthing ducking
beneath the tea tray nearly sending it flying

Michael comes out into the lobby where Mary Poppins waits
for him She holds out his briefcase

MARY POPPINS

The children come racing down the stairs with Gooding Frye
and Wilkins close behind

GEORGIE

WILKINS
I’m afraid your children burst into
my office just now Banks -

MICHAEL

WILKINS
I was just seeing if anything could
be done about extending your loan
when they came in claiming I was
trying to steal your house

ANNABEL
He is - we heard him

MICHAEL
Mr Wilkins is trying to help us

JOHN
Then why was he chasing us

Wilkins digs into a pocket pulling out a handful of toffees

WILKINS
I just thought they might stop
running about and making a scene if
I offered them some sweets

MICHAEL

I am so sorry Mr Wilkins
WILKINS

Let’s just see it doesn’t happen

again -

He places a toffee in Georgie’s hand one in John’s and one
in Annabel’s

WILKINS (contd)

(To the children )
After all you don’t want your
father losing his position on
account of you now do you

(Stepping close to

Michael kindly )
Now I know time is running short
Banks but I want you to have every
chance to pay off that loan - Ill

MICHAEL

WILKINS

Gentlemen -

He gestures for them to follow him upstairs As they go
ANNABEL

(To her father )
But Father he really did it -

MICHAEL
Not another word
(to Mary Poppins)
Take them home this instant We’1l
discuss this when I get back

MARY POPPINS
Come along children

Michael watches as Mary Poppins leads them out He turns
away tense then goes back to work

EXT SIDE STREET NEAR THE BANK - DUSK

Damp grey fog settles over London as Mary Poppins and the
children return home The children walk ahead of their nanny

JOHN
Now we’ve done it haven’t we I
don’t think I’ve ever seen father
that upset with us before

GEORGIE
But we were telling the truth

ANNABEL
That doesn’t matter Georgie We
got him into trouble - and he
doesn’t even know we broke mother’s
bowl

JOHN
Everything we’ve tried to fix
weve only made worse

EXT THE STREETS OF LONDON - DUSK

The children walk through the fog deep in thought Mary
Poppins follows behind

They come to a crossroads Annabel pauses looking around
The fog is getting so thick it’s difficult to make out the
buildings around them

ANNABEL
Which way do we go Mary Poppins

MARY POPPINS
Why would you ask me The three of
you are leading the way after all

ANNABEL
Us

JOHN
But we were -—

MARY POPPINS
- walking around in a fog

ANNABEL
No we weren’t - I mean yes we
are in a fog - but -

JOHN
- we were only talking

MARY POPPINS
Yes - too focused on where you’ve
been to pay attention to where
youre going

JOHN
But father told us to go straight
home

ANNABEL

He’1ll be furious if we’re late

MARY POPPINS
Not much to be done about that now
is there

GEORGIE
(Worried )
Are we lost then

JACK (0S)
That would depend on where you want
to go

A light appears through the fog Jack smiles down at them
from a streetlamp that hangs from an archway behind them

JOHNANNABELGEORGIE
Jack

JACK
At your service

Jack climbs halfway down and sits on a ledge just above Mary
Poppins and the children peering down at them

JACK (contd)
Say what’s with all the glum faces
Lost sixpence and found a penny

ANNABEL

Weve made a mess of everything
JOHN

Father’s furious with us
GEORGIE

And we can’t find our way home
JACK

(Not believing it)
“Lost” - are you Mary Poppins

MARY POPPINS
Hopelessly

JACK
Well now I’m no expert but if
ever I lose my way I just look for
a little light to guide me

“TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC”

LET’S SAY YOU’RE LOST IN A PARK
SURE YOU CAN GIVE IN TO THE DARK
OR YOU CAN TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC WITH ME

WHEN YOU’RE ALONE IN YOUR ROOM
YOUR CHOICE IS JUST EMBRACE THE GLOOM
OR YOU CAN TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC WITH ME

FOR IF YOU HIDE UNDER THE COVERS
YOU MIGHT NEVER SEE THE DAY

BUT IF A SPARK CAN START

INSIDE YOUR HEART

THEN YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND THE WAY

SO WHEN LIFE IS GETTIN’ DREARY
JUST PRETEND THAT YOURE A “LEERIE”
AS YOU TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC WITH ME

Jack jumps onto a lamppost

JOHN
What’s a leerie

JACK
Why it’s what we lamplighters call
ourselves of course

He flickers the streetlamp on and off in a rhythmic pattern

JACK (contd)
Time to send out the call to arms
“Leeries trip the lights and lead
the way”

As a Leerie lights his lamp we DROP DOWN to find Jack
leading the group through the foggy streets like the Pied
Piper He steers the children up curbs and around pillar
boxes

NOW WHEN YOU’RE STUCK IN THE MIST
SURE YOU CAN STRUGGLE AND RESIST
OR YOU CAN TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC WITH ME

NOW SAY YOU’RE LOST IN THE CROWD
WELL YOU CAN STAMP AND SCREAM OUT LOUD
OR YOU CAN TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC WITH ME

Ahead lights continue to flicker on lighting their way One
by one leeries appear out of the fog gazing down from
lampposts acknowledging the children as they pass

JACK (contd)
AND WHEN THE FOG COMES ROLLIN’ IN
JUST KEEP YOUR FEET UPON THE PATH
MUSTNT MOPE AND FROWN
OR WORSE LIE DOWN
DON’T LET IT BE YOUR EPITAPH

SO WHEN LIFE IS GETTIN’ SCARY

BE YOUR OWN ILLUMINARY

WHO CAN SHINE THEIR LIGHT FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE
AS YOU TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC WITH ME

A LEERIE LOVES THE EDGE OF NIGHT
THOUGH DIM TO HIM THE WORLD LOOKS BRIGHT
HES GOT THE GIFT OF SECOND SIGHT

THE LEERIES
TO TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC

JACK
A LEERIES JOBS TO LIGHT THE WAY

THE LEERIES
TO TAKE THE NIGHT
AND MAKE IT DAY

JACK
WE MIMIC THE MOON YES THATS OUR AIM

JACK AND THE LEERIES
FOR WERE THE KEEPERS OF THE FLAME

JACK
AND IF YOURE DEEP INSIDE A TUNNEL
AND THERE IS NO END IN SIGHT
WELL JUST CARRY ON
UNTIL THE DAWN
IT’S DARKEST RIGHT BEFORE THE LIGHT

They come to a dead end A lamppost with an ornate base
stands before them

JOHN
Now what do we do

MARY POPPINS
Just as Jack said - we follow the
light

She steps onto the base of the lamp which magically
disappears into the ground creating an unusually LONG
LAMPPOST One by one they all follow her sliding down the
post like it’s a FIREMAN’S POLE They arrive at the entrance
to a drainpipe and duck into it The leeries voices echo
inside the tunnel

JACK
AS YOU

JACK (contd)
TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC
WON’T YOU
TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC
COME ON
TRIP A LITTLE LIGHT FANTASTIC WITH ME

Jack Mary Poppins and the children arrive at

EXT AN ABANDONED PARK -— CONTINUOUS

An abandoned park with an unused fountain at its center
shrouded in darkness The street lamps and pathways of the
park are silhouetted only by moonlight

One by one gas lamps flick on revealing leeries on every
lamppost - until the entire park is glowing with brilliant
light

DANCE SEQUENCE - which includes Jack and all the leeries
spinning on lampposts and performing spectacular stunts on
their bicycles

The Leeries all dance round their lamp posts jumping on and
off

Jack joins them tipping his hat to Angus and the other
Leeries Jack and a small group of Leeries dance in front of
Mary Poppins and the children

They join the other Leeries on lamp posts as other Leeries on
bikes perform amazing stunts and parkour over traveling
ladders followed by a ladder section

Jack Angus and the crew dance jumping up and spinning round
the lamp posts

At the end of it ANGUS bounds over to the children

ANGUS
Come along - join us in a bit of
kick and prance

JOHN
What did he say

JACK

Kick and prance - it means “dance”
It’s leerie speak You don’t say
the word you mean you say
something that rhymes only -

(It’s hard to describe )
Here Ill show you how it works
Angus

GIVE US YOUR WEEP AND WAIL

JACK (contd)
(To the children aside)
TO THE REST OF YA THAT MEANS “TALE”

ANGUS
I WAS SHORT OF A SHEET

JACK
HE WAS IN THE STREET

ANGUS
JUST TO TUMBLE DOWN THE SINK

JACK
JUST TO GET HIMSELF A DRINK

ANGUS
THEN I PINCHED WHAT’S FATTER

JACK
HE GRABBED HIS LADDER

ANGUS
TO SMILE AND SMIRK

JACK AND ANGUS
TO WORK

You see There’s nothing to it

ANNABEL

MARY POPPINS
(A wide-eyed glance )

The children join in the number dancing round the fountain
with the Leeries as Mary Poppins looks on from up top

The Leeries all surround Mary Poppins on the fountain

THE LEERIES

Mary Poppins is lifted off the fountain and joins in the
number with the Leeries At the end of which she performs
an amazing bike spin and magically turns on the fountain

JACK

open and Michael steps out

MICHAEL

The children stop in their tracks startled Behind them all
the leeries except for Jack have mysteriously disappeared
into the fog

ANNABEL
We’re sorry we’re late father It
wasn’t Mary Poppins’ fault

JOHN
We got lost in the fog

GEORGIE
Jack and the leeries led us down
the ‘frog and toad’

MARY POPPINS
He means ‘road’

MICHAEL
So you’ve been off filling the
children’s heads with stuff and
nonsense I’ve heard quite enough -
come in at once

JACK
Best I take my leave Good night
Mary Poppins

MARY POPPINS
Good night Jack

The children hurry inside with Mary Poppins following them
Michael enters last shutting the door firmly behind him

INT THE BANKS FRONT ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS
Ellen is waiting in the front entry hall as everyone enters

MICHAEL
Into the parlor - go on

The children obey

ELLEN
Don’t be too ‘ard on ‘em Sir
They are just children after all

MICHAEL
(Turning back testily)
Of course they’re children - my
children - and I will deal with them
as I see fit Now leave us to it

ELLEN
Yes sir

She heads into the kitchen Mary Poppins starts upstairs

MICHAEL
Not you Mary Poppins In here

MARY POPPINS
Very well sir

She follows Michael into

INT THE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

where the children await sentence Michael takes a moment
to get control over his emotions before he speaks

MICHAEL
You could have lost me my job - do
you understand that A good
position like mine is hard to come
by these days But there you all
were running about -
(Turning to Mary Poppins )

MICHAEL (contd)
And I thought that you Mary
Poppins - I thought you were here
to look after these children

JOHN
It wasn’t her doing it was me

ANNABEL
It was us We thought maybe if we
talked to Mr Frye he could give
you more time to save the house

JOHN
We were only trying to help

MICHAEL

Well you didn’t help

(A deep breath)
I know this has been a difficult
year for our family and I have
done my best to keep the three of
you from worrying - but I can’t do
this alone It’s too much I’m
barely holding on as it is I can’t
even seem to remember my briefcase
in the morning and there is no
more time were about to lose this
house - and I can’t lose our
home I just don’t know what to
do anymore I don’t know what to
do Everything has fallen to pieces
since your mother

(Suddenly overcome )
Haven’t we lost enough already

GEORGIE
(After a beat)
We haven’t lost mother Not really
“THE PLACE WHERE LOST THINGS GO” - reprise
GEORGIE (contd)
NOTHING’S GONE FOREVER
ONLY OUT OF PLACE
SO WHEN WE NEED HER TOUCH AND LOVING GAZE

GEORGIE AND JOHN

GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN IS THE PERFECT PHRASE

GEORGIE JOHN AND ANNABEL
SMILING FROM A STAR THAT SHE MAKES GLOW

GEORGIE
TRUST SHE’S ALWAYS THERE

JOHN
WATCHING AS WE GROW

ANNABEL
FIND HER IN THE PLACE

GEORGIE JOHN AND ANNABEL
WHERE THE LOST THINGS GO

MICHAEL
(Deeply moved )
When did you all get so clever

GEORGIE
Last night Mary Poppins told us

Georgie is about to say more when Mary Poppins catches his
eye and raises a finger to her lips mouthing a silent “Shh”

Michael kneels in front of the children

MICHAEL
I hope I am as clever as you when I
grow up You’re right Your mother’s
not gone She’s in your smile
Georgie and John’s walk and
Annabel’s eyes And she’ll always be
with us wherever we go

Michael wraps them in his arms Mary Poppins takes this in a
look of satisfaction in her eyes

MICHAEL (contd)
Go on now - time to wash your
hands for dinner

The children go Michael turns to Mary Poppins

MICHAEL (contd)
Did you have something to do with
them trying to save the house

MARY POPPINS
I never said a word - it was all
the children’s idea

MICHAEL
(After a pause)
The whole time I’ve been looking
after them they’ve been looking
after me
(He shakes his head)
I had it all backwards

MARY POPPINS
Hmm A Banks family trait

MICHAEL
What was I thinking
MARY POPPINS
Some people think a great deal too
much Of that I am certain

She disappears upstairs leaving Michael to ponder this

them rustling down the cobblestones

At 17 Cherry Tree Lane Jack Angus and two other leeries
search through boxes in the back of a moving van filled with
the family’s possessions Aunt Jane comes out of the house
carrying a box Jack hurries over to help Aunt Jane with it

JACK
Here Jane - let me help you with
that

He takes the box Aunt Jane nods toward the van

AUNT JANE
Thank you No luck

JACK
(Shaking his head )
We can look through everything

AUNT JANE
There’s no point It’s nearly

Michael stands in the entryway to the sitting room The
furniture is gone the curtains have been taken down Aunt
Jane comes in and crosses to Michael’s side

A pause as their situation sinks in They look around the
empty sitting room one last time

The children come downstairs with suitcases followed by Mary
Poppins carpetbag in hand

MARY POPPINS
The children have packed up the
last of their things themselves

MICHAEL
Well done all of you
(Putting an arm around
Georgie )
Have you got Gillie

GEORGIE
Yes father

Ellen comes out of the kitchen with suitcases

ELLEN
Good riddance to that old kitchen
Never could figure out that stove

MICHAEL
Well then we’ve spent every
last moment we can here It’s time
to say goodbye

Goodbye old friend

AUNT JANE AND THE CHILDREN
Goodbye old friend

Aunt Jane crosses to open the door and everyone files out
Michael turns out the lights and shuts the door behind him

The family steps outside surprised to discover a handful of
neighbors and friends coming over from the Admiral’s house -
Miss Lark and the Milkman are there along with the Admiral
and Binnacle

MICHAEL
(Knowing the answer )
What are you all doing here so late
BINNACLE
Weve been waitin’ to see you off

MILKMAN
We’d be here no matter what the hour

MISS LARK
If you and your family should ever
need a place to stay Willoughby and
I would be happy for the company

MICHAEL

AUNT JANE

I wish you’d come with us Ellen

ELLEN

GEORGIE
She says she’s not leaving until
the door opens

MICHAEL
(He laughs perplexed )
In any case your home is with us
(To Georgie smiling)
I’m pleased she got caught on your
string Georgie

Georgie hurries forward as Michael is about to lock the door

GEORGIE
My kite - I forgot my kite

MICHAEL
Very well - but be quick about it

Georgie runs into the house Binnacle pushes the Admiral’s
wheelchair over to Michael

BINNACLE
The Admiral has something he would
like to give you Mr Banks Sir

The Admiral hands him a beautifully-wrought ship in a bottle

ADMIRAL BOOM
The HMS Glad Tidings - I
commanded her myself May she guide
you safely into port

MICHAEL

Thank you so much Admiral
(He salutes )

Ill take good care of her

The Admiral checks his pocket watch

ADMIRAL BOOM
It’s nearly eight bells Mr
Binnacle Time to man our posts

BINNACLE
Yes sir Goodbye Mr Banks sir

MICHAEL
Goodbye Mr Binnacle

As Binnacle wheels the Admiral off Georgie comes out of the
house his arms wrapped around his kite

GEORGIE
I found it

MICHAEL
I’m not so sure that will get off
the ground anymore - it looks more
glue than kite

Michael takes a few steps toward the house then glances back

MICHAEL (contd)
Georgie did you patch that up with
one of my old drawings It looks
like youve done a fine job there

Michael gestures for Georgie to hand him the kite He runs a
hand over the patches that Georgie has made from his sketch
of Michael Kate and the children

MICHAEL (contd)
(kneels)
Look at that - all of us together
in front of the

As he holds up the kite light from the streetlamp hits it
from behind Printed lettering upside down and backwards
shows through the patches Michael blinks He turns the kite
over and pieces together the words written on the patches
CERTIFICATE OF SHARES
GEORGIE
What is it father

MICHAEL
Wait

(Stunned and elated )
“Certificate of Shares” This is it -
this is what we’ve been looking for

(Suddenly panicked )

We have to get to the bank What
time is it - anyone

JOHN
(Checking his watch )
Seven minutes to midnight

MICHAEL
Seven minutes It’s not enough We
need to make it to the bank by
midnight

JACK
Take the van

JOHN
No it’s no good You still wont
make it in time

AUNT JANE
What can we do

MICHAEL
(Defeated )
Nothing We can’t turn back time

ANNABEL
(After a beat )
Why not “Everything is possible -
even the impossible”

She looks to Mary Poppins Mary Poppins smiles

JOHN
Can we do it then Mary Poppins
Can we turn back time

MARY POPPINS
I don’t see why that couldn’t be
arranged

MICHAEL
That’s ridiculous

MARY POPPINS
Indeed it is Michael It’s nonsense

ANNABEL
Foolishness

JOHN
It makes no sense And if it makes
no sense-

JOHNANNABELGEORGIE

It can’t be true

MICHAEL
What are you all talking about

MARY POPPINS
Never you mind You just get to the
bank as fast as possible with that
kite and leave the rest to us

Mary Poppins guides Michael and Aunt Jane over to the van As
they climb into the cab

MICHAEL
But how will you -

THE CHILDREN
GO

Michael nods He closes the door and they drive off Mary
Poppins turns to Jack They walk to his bicycle

MARY POPPINS
We’ll need a lot of help Jack

JACK
Good as done Angus gather the
leeries

ANGUS
Right

JACK
Children help me ready the
bicycle

Angus and the leeries run to their bicycles Georgie and the
twins hurry to Jack’s bicycle flipping the ladder sideways
across the rear fender Mary Poppins hikes her skirts and
climbs onto the bicycle seat sidesaddle

MARY POPPINS
I’1ll take the reins this time -
speed is of the essence

JOHN
Have you ever ridden a bicycle like
this before

MARY POPPINS
(An impatient sigh )
Oh please - how different can it
be from riding an elephant

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Climb aboard everyone Ready
and up Now all we have to do is
turn back time

The bicycle rockets down the lane Mary Poppins leading the
leeries not bothering - and somehow not needing - to pedal

EXT THE MALL AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

FRYE
He does have a few more minutes

Twenty leeries Mary Poppins and the twins stand on the
rooftop of Parliament next to Big Ben Angus helps Georgie
climb up the last few rungs of a ladder Jack right behind

John gestures to one of the Leeries for his cap

JACK
(Hushed urgency )
Good - now over to the tower

The leeries all grab ladders and rush to the tower John
head down in his Leerie cap lifts a ladder and starts to
follow them

JACK (contd)
Sorry - this is as far as you go
(Taking the ladder )
Back in a flash

Jack hurries to the tower throwing his ladder to Angus

JACK (contd)
Cmon

Jack runs up to the wall and begins to climb Angus splits
the ladder and throws up the top half to jack

Jack jams the ladder diagonally against the wall Angus
throws up another ladder is passed up to him He places that
on the opposite diagonal to the first and start to climb up
the ladder as Angus starts to climb below him

The others put their ladders against the wall and climb up
behind him passing ladders overhead

It is a hair-raisingly dangerous process that looks almost
certain to end in disaster

Mary Poppins and the children watch from THE ROOFTOP as Jack
climbs up to a ledge A pigeon suddenly rushes out at him
making him drop his ladder He loses his balance and hangs
from the ledge

ANNABEL
I can’t watch

Mary Poppins shakes her head in disapproval
MARY POPPINS

You would think they’d never done
this before

BACK ON THE TOWER Jack climbs into an arch having nearly
reached the clock’s face He looks up realizing the overhang
prevents them from reaching it

ANGUS
(Calls up to him)
What are we going to do

JACK
(Shouting down )
I’ve got an idea C’mon

Jack jumps into the arch Angus climbs up onto the ledge
outside the arch Jack calls down to the Leeries below

JACK (contd)
Ladder

Another Leerie climbs up a second passes up two ladders
jumping up behind him

They interlock the ladders Jack places it out over the edge
like a diving board

He walks out onto the end of the ladder as two Leeries hold
it steady from inside the arch

Jack turns round at the very edge a huge drop below him He
teadies himself

n

ON THE ROOFTOP - the children gasp as they watch Jack fly up
into the air backlit by the glowing face of Big Ben’s dial
AT THE TOWER - Jack lands on the ledge beneath the clock’s
face He opens a small hinged window set into the face of the
clock and squeezes inside

Jack squints around the tower finding the gas main He
cranks it closed shutting off the gaslights that illuminate
all the faces of the clock

Jack sticks his head out of the open window Angus calls up
to him

Jack peers up at the enormous face of the clock

JACK
How I can’t reach the hands
Down below Mary Poppins sighs growing exasperated

MARY POPPINS
Ohhh - Honestly

JOHN
They’d better hurry We have less
than a minute to go

Up on the tower the leeries seem to have run out of ideas

ANGUS
We’re too late Jack

JACK
There’s got to be a way

GEORGIE

Suddenly Mary Poppins appears floating before the clock
face holding her umbrella As she descends she pushes the
minute hand backward five and a half minutes The leeries
cheer

Wilkins glances out the window to the street below noticing
a van pulling up He sees Michael getting out

Michael and Aunt Jane run back round the side of the bank and
desperately try to fly the kite up to Wilkins office

MICHAEL (contd)

view outside the window behind him

DOWN BELOW Michael and Aunt Jane are flying the kite trying
to position it outside the balcony so Wilkins will see it

AUNT JANE
It won’t work - He’s never going to
see it

As BIG BEN BEGINS TO TOLL MIDNIGHT Mary Poppins appears in
the sky behind Michael and Aunt Jane umbrella in hand She
takes a breath and gently blows The wind rises the windows
fly open and the kite breaks free from its string

floating into WILKINS’ OFFICE It hits Wilkins in the
back of the head before landing on his desk

DOWN BELOW - Michael and Aunt Jane rush back to pull on the
bank doors

INSIDE Gooding continues to resist - but Frye can’t take it
anymore He lets go of the handle and steps back Gooding
goes sprawling as the door swings open and Michael and Aunt
Jane rush inside thinking the men have unlocked the door

MICHAEL
Oh - thank you so much

AUNT JANE
Thank you

FRYE

Frye catches Gooding glaring at him

GOODING

In the OFFICE Wilkins stares at the kite on his desk
bewildered He sees the words “Certificate of Shares” peering
through a hole in the kite

Michael gently peels a piece of the share certificate off the
kite Wilkins Aunt Jane Mary Poppins Jack the children
and the lawyers watch as he places it with the rest of the
share certificate which lies on the desk - in fragments but
nearly complete

MICHAEL
And this one goes here
AUNT JANE
Does it matter if it’s all cut up
in bits Is it still worth
anything

FRYE
It’s valid so long as all the
pieces are there

WILKINS
(Through gritted teeth )
Is that so

Michael examines the kite searching for the final piece
It’s not there

MICHAEL
Georgie there was one more piece -
a corner piece with a lot of
signatures Do you remember it

GEORGIE
I must have thrown it out I’m
sorry father

MICHAEL
Oh it’s alright Georgie -

WILKINS

No it isn’t I’m afraid you have a
problem Banks Without those
signatures you have no bank
shares no house - you have
nothing

Michael turns looking at Wilkins with new eyes

MICHAEL
What

ANNABEL
But he knows you have bank shares

JOHN
He’s been planning this all along

WILKINS
Take your children out of here
Banks I’ve heard enough of their
lies

MICHAEL
(Eyes blazing with anger)
Don’t you dare insult my children -
don’t you DARE They’re not lying
and you know it I only wish I had
believed them sooner

MICHAEL (contd)

You all had him pegged right from
the start

Take the house - go ahead

(Putting his arms around

the children )
I have everything I need right

A double door that leads into an adjacent boardroom swings
open MR DAWES JR enters (80s - full of vigor)

MR DAWES JR
He has you there Willie

WILKINS
Uncle Dawes What on earth are you
doing here

MR DAWES JR
A little bird told me that you’ve
been trying to cheat the Banks
family out of their shares in
Fidelity Fiduciary

JACK
That he has we heard him

Dawes glances over to Mary Poppins’ parrot umbrella The
umbrella gives him a sly wink

MR DAWES JR
I also hear you’ve been telling the
whole of London I’ve gone loony The
only loony thing I did is trust you
to look after this bank

WILKINS
You can’t be serious I’ve nearly
doubled the profits of this bank

MR DAWES JR

Yes by wringing it out of our
customer’s pockets Their trust in
us built this bank - and now youve
squandered every last bit of their
good will So I’m back and you’re
out

See my nephew to the door would

MR DAWES JR
Thank you Michael And by the way -
those shares of yours are perfectly
fine - save them for your family

MICHAEL
I’m sorry I don’t understand -

MR DAWES JR
Id like to tell you a little
story

They gather beside him As “FEED THE BIRDS” plays under

MR DAWES JR (contd)
Once upon a time there was a man
with a wooden leg named Smith - Oh
no no no Not that one There was
little boy named Michael who wanted
to give his tuppence to a bird lady
- but in the end and after a
little persuasion he decided to
give it to his father instead
Michael’s father - your grandfather
- gave that tuppence to this bank
and he asked us to guard it well
We did just that and thanks to
several quite clever investments -
if I do say so myself

(Turning to Michael )

That tuppence has grown into quite
a sum

MICHAEL
Really

MR DAWES JR
(With a smile)
Really Michael Enough in fact
to pay off that loan you took The
house is yours

The Banks children rush to hug their father Mary Poppins
off to the side allows herself a little satisfied grin

Mmm-hmm go on

MICHAEL

Through the park gates they see that colorful tents have
been set up in the center of the green Crowds stand in line
for food carts games of chance and a small Ferris wheel

JOHN

GEORGIE

MICHAEL

I don’t see why not

GEORGIE

The children surround their father urging him along with
them as they rush into the park

ANNABEL

JOHN
Will you go on the Ferris wheel
with us
MICHAEL

Yes yes - and you too Jane
AUNT JANE
(Taking Ellen’s arm)
Only if Ellen comes with me

ELLEN
I wouldn’t be caught dead on that
thing

The family hurries ahead as their voices trail off Mary
Poppins slows a knowing look in her eyes as she watches them
go on ahead without her

The family arrives at the fair There are familiar faces in
the crowd Miss Lark and Willoughby the Milkman - even the
Park Keeper having a miserable time watching everyone
trample over his grass A street organ begins to play

CLOSE on a bundle of balloons WE CIRCLE ROUND to reveal the
BALLOON LADY - a kind-hearted street vendor who is perhaps a
little bit magical

“NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP”

BALLOON LADY
LIFE’S A BALLOON
THAT TUMBLES OR RISES
DEPENDING ON WHAT IS INSIDE

FILL IT WITH HOPE

AND PLAYFUL SURPRISES

AND OH DEARIE DUCKS

MICHAEL
(Holds out coins)
Hello - we would like some of your
very finest balloons please

BALLOON LADY
That you shall have But choose
carefully my dearie ducks Many have
chosen the wrong balloon - be sure to
choose the one that’s right for you

MICHAEL
Which one would you like Georgie

GEORGIE
Umm

BALLOON LADY
Why don’t you go first sir

Michael hesitates

MICHAEL
Me Those days are long behind me
I don’t think I’ve held a balloon
since I was a child

BALLOON LADY
Then you’ve forgotten what it’s like

MICHAEL
(Amused )
To hold a balloon

BALLOON LADY
To be a child

IF YOUR SELECTION FEELS RIGHT
WELL THEN DEARIE HOLD TIGHT
IF YOU SEE YOUR REFLECTION
YOUR HEART WILL TAKE FLIGHT

As Michael reaches inside the bundle choosing a balloon
IF YOU PICK THE RIGHT STRING

THEN YOUR HEART WILL TAKE WING
AND THERE’S NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP

WITH A SHINY NEW TOY

MICHAEL
JUST ONE DAY AT THE FAIR
HAS ME WALTZING ON AIR

He looks back to Aunt Jane overcome with joy

Jane - I remember It’s all true
Every impossible thing we imagined
with Mary Poppins - it all
happened

Michael soars into the sky

NOW MY HEART IS SO LIGHT
THAT I THINK I JUST MIGHT
START FEEDING THE BIRDS
AND THEN GO FLY A KITE

WITH YOUR HEAD IN A CLOUD
ONLY LAUGHTER’S ALLOWED
AND THERE’S NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP

DOWN BELOW GEORGIE ANNABEL and JOHN each choose their own
balloons and lift up into the air

CHILDREN
WE’RE ZIGGING AND ZAGGING
OUR FEET NEVER DRAGGING
WE MIGHT TAKE A RIDE TO THE MOON

ALL COMES FROM BELIEVING

Jack comes through the crowd to the Balloon Lady

JACK
THE PAST IS THE PAST
IT LIVES ON AS HISTORY
AND THAT’S AN IMPORTANT THING

He sees Aunt Jane turn to look into the bundle for her own
‘right’ balloon

THE FUTURE COMES FAST
EACH SECOND A MYSTERY
FOR NOBODY KNOWS WHAT TOMORROW MAY BRING

He picks out a balloon offering it to her

JACK (contd
This one looks like you

Aunt Jane gazes into the balloon smiles
AUNT JANE
How do you know

And with that Aunt Jane floats up into the air Admiral Boom
and Binnacle come through the crowd having watched this
whole exchange

ADMIRAL BOOM
Don’t you lose her son

Jack takes a balloon As he floats off calling back

JACK
I wont sir

Jack rises up in the air to float beside Aunt Jane

AUNT JANE
UP HERE IN THE BLUE
IT’S A MARVELOUS VIEW

JACK AND AUNT JANE
SIDE BY SIDE IS THE BEST WAY TO FLY

JACK
ONCE I JUST LOOKED ABOVE
BUT NOW I AM PART OF
THE LOVELY LONDON SKY

DOWN BELOW Wilkins hesitantly approaches the Balloon Lady
BALLOON LADY
Would you like to try one yourself

WILKINS
Why not - I’ll give it a go

BALLOON LADY
Alright love Choose carefully

He chooses a balloon but instead of lifting him in the air
it slowly sinks to the ground He looks to the Balloon Lady

BALLOON LADY (contd)
Well

THERE’S NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP

UP ABOVE Ellen rises quickly into the air passing the
family

ELLEN
WHEN THE CLOUDS MAKE A MUSS
WELL I WONT MAKE A FUSS
(Flying straight up)
BUT ILL POLISH THE STARS
THE BANKS FAMILY
(Grabbing her legs)
ELLEN BETTER LET US

Gooding and Frye are up in the air - Frye holds a single
balloon while Gooding grips onto him for dear life

GOODING AND FRYE
GIVE A LIFT TO A FOE
FOR YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW

ALL
AND THERE’S NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP

BACK DOWN BELOW the Admiral floats out of his wheelchair
Binnacle rising up behind him

ADMIRAL BOOM

Binnacle

BINNACLE

UP ABOVE the sky is filled with parkgoers including Miss
Lark and Willoughby the Milkman and the Park Keeper

ALL

EXT THE PARK - CONTINUOUS

Mary Poppins stands in the park gazing at the people
floating above umbrella in hand and carpet bag at her side
The Balloon Lady comes over

BALLOON LADY
Of course the grown-ups will all
forget by tomorrow

MARY POPPINS
They always do

BALLOON LADY
Only one balloon left Mary
Poppins I think it must be yours

MARY POPPINS
I suppose it must

The Balloon Lady passes Mary Poppins the balloon - a red one -
then leaves Mary Poppins looks inside the balloon and sees
an image of herself looking very much as she always looks
She nods satisfied

MARY POPPINS (contd)
Practically Perfect in every way

As Mary Poppins gazes at the balloon her own image fades
instead she sees Michael Aunt Jane Ellen and the children
floating down

EXT THE BANKS HOME - CONTINUOUS
to land on the street in front of their house

MICHAEL
Welcome home everyone

AUNT JANE
It’s nice to be back isn’t it

MICHAEL
It is - so nice I never thought
Id feel this much joy and wonder
ever again I thought that door was
closed to me forever

At that moment A STRONG GUST OF WIND BLOWS swirling cherry
blossoms around them and THROWING THE FRONT DOOR WIDE OPEN
EXT THE PARK - CONTINUOUS

The same wind sweeps across the park cherry blossoms
cascading down around Mary Poppins as well Her balloon slips
from her fingers and swirls up into the sky

EXT THE BANKS HOME - CONTINUOUS

The children run excitedly into the house - which has been
fully restored to its former state Ellen goes up the steps
following the children inside

EXT THE PARK - CONTINUOUS

MARY POPPINS
It’s time

She opens her umbrella raises it up into the breeze and
floats into the air

EXT THE BANKS HOME - CONTINUOUS

As the last of the cherry blossoms fall Aunt Jane looks over
at Michael and realizes the truth

AUNT JANE
She’s gone hasn’t she Michael

MICHAEL
(He nods Quietly)
Thank you Mary Poppins Goodbye

EXT OUTSIDE THE PARK GATESTHE SKIES ABOVE - DAY

Jack having landed his balloon tied on his bicycle glances
up at Mary Poppins He tips his cap to her smiling

JACK
I wont forget Mary Poppins

promise
“LOVELY LONDON SKY” - reprise

JACK (contd)
SO HOLD ON TIGHT TO THOSE YOU LOVE
AND MAYBE SOON FROM UP ABOVE
YOULL BE BLESSED SO KEEP ON LOOKING HIGH

And with that Jack climbs onto his bike and pedals off

WHILE YOU’RE UNDERNEATH THE
LOVELY LONDON SKY

EXT HIGH ABOVE LONDON - CONTINUOUS

Mary Poppins floats high above the scene She glances back
for just a moment smiling then soars off into the clouds
