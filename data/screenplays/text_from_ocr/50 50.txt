Shooting Script
EXT SEATTLE -— DAY

It’s an unusually clear winter day as the peaks of Mount
Rainier look down on the avenues and harbors of Seattle

ADAM LERNER jogs through the streets of Seattle The
morning mist envelops the PIER Adam’s iPod blares in his ear
as he passes the FISH MARKET

Adam arrives at a street corner Ahead a “Don’t Walk” sign
blinks So he does Running in place Adam looks from side to
side There’s not a car person or thing in sight this early
in the morning He looks again at the orange hand urging him
to stop

Another JOGGER runs up behind Adam and disobeys the
crosswalk running past him and across the street Adam
continues to wait for the light to change

The light goes green He crosses

INT SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER

Adam tries to squirt shampoo into his hand but the bottle is
empty He looks over at a large assortment of women’s
products grabs the first one - Fructis by L’Oreal - and
squirts some into his hair He proceeds to lather his entire
body in the product

INT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Adam dresses in front of the mirror His outfit is well put-
together He pulls out a LINT BRUSH and meticulously combs
his cardigan RACHAEL wearing her oversized “KEEP TAHOE
BLUE” shirt enters the bedroom brushing her teeth

ADAM
So are you staying over tonight

RACHAEL
UhNot sure There are a couple
of gallery openings I want to check
out

Rachael goes through Adam’s drawers looking for something
RACHAEL (CONTD)
I’m so nervous about my show I

still have so much work to do

(CONTTNURFD )

RACHAEL (CONTD)
I need two more paintings and
everything I’ve been coming up with
is completely derivative of what
I’ve been seeing at the Henry
(confused)
Where’s my stuff

ADAM
It’s in your drawer

RACHAEL
(honored)
I have a drawer

ADAM
(sheepish)
Yeah I just figured I’d put some
of your things there wasn’t

anything in the drawer Well there
were a few things but I just moved
them to a different one because
It made sense that way

RACHAEL
(touched)
Awwwww Honey We’re getting so

Rachael’s

KYLE
Well you smell like you fucked the
cast of “The View”

Adam looks at his watch

ADAM
Are we gonna go We’re gonna be

KYLE

If you really care about being on
time you should probably learn how
to drive

ADAM
I deserve that

(CONTTNURFD )

KYLE
You know what’s really going to
make us late When I stop for
cappuccinos

ADAM
No no no We have coffee at work

KYLE

Kyle drives off

INT COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Adam and Kyle stand in line Kyle watches as Adam yawns
repeatedly He looks exhausted

KYLE
Back still hurts

ADAM
Yeah I’m going to see the doctor
today

KYLE
Have you been fucking in weird
positions

ADAM
Of course that’s where you have to
go with it

KYLE
Sometimes it happens when I try new
positions - like I tried froggy
style for a while fucked up my
back

ADAM
“Froggy style” I don’t even want
to ask what that is

KYLE
It’s kind of like doggy style but
you get way higher up

ADAM

(beat)
We haven’t done it in three weeks

(CONTTNURFD )

KYLE
(shocked)
You haven’t had sex in three
weeks

ADAM
Well she had a yeast infection
and then she had her period

KYLE
You can fuck on a yeast infection

ADAM
No it hurts

KYLE
It does

ADAM
Well that’s what she says

KYLE
I think that’s bullshit

ADAM
No I’ve heard that before

KYLE
Has she been sucking on your dick
giving you blow jobs

ADAM
No she doesn’t like to

KYLE
(a little upset)
No fucking shit she doesn’t like
to Who likes putting dicks in
their mouths That’s why they call
them jobs

ADAM
Don’t get hysterical it’s not that
big a deal

KYLE
I’m not hysterical She stays at
your house all the time She leaves
her fucking shit everywhere You
clean it up You’re a nice person
The least she can do is felate you
EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Kyle and Adam walk down the sidewalk Adam’s a few steps
ahead walking at a hurried pace as Kyle takes his time sips
his coffee

KYLE
You put up with a lot of shit when
you date a hot girl Truthfully
that’s why if you recall in high
school I didn’t date any hot girls

ADAM
That’s why

KYLE
Yes That’s why

ADAM
Well we’re not in high school
anymore The relationship I have
with Rachael is about more than
sex

KYLE
(condescending)
What is it about Adam

ADAM
We care about each other -- talk to
each other

KYLE
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could do
that and bang the hell out of each
other afterwards
They walk up the front steps of SEATTLE PUBLIC RADIO
ADAM
Ideally yes But it’s nota
perfect world OKCan you hurry
up please
Kyle stops and leans over

KYLE
UghJust got to tie my shoe

INT SEATTLE PUBLIC RADIO - DAY
Adam and Kyle enter the offices of Seattle Public Radio They

pass JENNY at the reception desk Kyle shoots her a smile

(CONTTNURFD )

KYLE
Morning Jenny

She ignores him As they continue Seth looks over at Adam
nervously biting on his finger nails

KYLE
That’s so gross man You shouldn’t
do that

PHIL Adam and Kyle’s boss passes by

PHIL
KyleAdam

KYLE AND ADAM
Hey Phil

ADAM
(worried)
Sorry were late

Phil looks at his watch not even aware of the time

PHIL
Huh Look at that you are late
Don’t do that

ADAM
Listen I wanted to talk to you
about the volcano piece it’s
coming along really well I’ve done
all the research and interviews-

PHIL
Great

ADAM
Yeah but the narration is turning
into a bit of a problem Whoever
did it he kept clearing his throat
and he didn’t pause he just kept
talking - there aren’t any edit
points If he had just stopped and
cleared his throat I could cut
around it but he didn’t--

Phil’s cell phone rings

PHIL
Cool

KYLE
Yeah grab that

(CONTTNURFD )

Phil pulls out his Blackberry and walks off ignoring the

conversation

ADAM
OK I’m just going to--

Adam and Kyle watch Phil walk away Adam turns to Kyle

ADAM
Its like he doesnt care

KYLE
It’s like we got to put shit on the
air And it’s pointless to spend
months working on something that
someone’s going to hear for two
seconds stopped at a red light

ADAM
I like it when my work is good

KYLE
Good luck with that

INT ADAM’S CUBICLE - LATER

Adam sits at his desk head phones on editing his volcano
story on Pro-Tools He meticulously edits the same audio
point over and over He cringes at the deafening sound of

Kyle’s laughter across the office

KYLE
(into phone)
You’re in Wales So does that make
you Welsh Or Wale-ish

Adam looks at Kyle in annoyance

KYLE
OK World MusicCan you hear me
You sound like a robotDoes it
sound weird to you It sounds weird
to me

ADAM
You have to be quieter I’m--

Kyle is oblivious to Adam

KYLE
I said you sound like a robot
Wait wait wait Go back
(MORE )

(CONTTNURFD )

KYLE (contd)
It’s unbelievable I know I don’t
know what ‘World Music’ is either

Annoyed Adam imitates Kyle to himself

ADAM
(as Kyle)
I’m such a fucking asshole I’m the
king of the world suck my dick I
hear Adam hasn’t gotten his dick
sucked in six fucking months

EXT PACIFIC GENERAL HOSPITAL - LATER
Adam steps off a BUS and walks toward the hospital’s vast

sunlit entryway He enters through the sliding double doors
eventually disappearing into the din of the crowd

INT DR ROSS’ OFFICE - LATER

Adam leafs through a pamphlet on incontinence when the
pedantic DR ROSS enters

DR ROSS
(curt)
Hi

Dr Ross looks over Adam’s chart examines his MRI scans and
pulls out a DICTAPHONE -

DR ROSS

(into the dictaphone)
Patient has been complaining of
back pain and night sweats Blood
tests and urine analysis are
normal MRI suggests a massive
intradural malignant schwannoma
neurofibrosarcoma extending into
psoas muscle with nerve root
compression syndrome and bone
erosion

We see Adam’s face gradually look more and more confused He
slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question

DR ROSS (CONTD)
Growth extends from the L2 to L5
Will send patient for biopsy to
confirm

Dr Ross turns to see Adam holding his arm in the air

(CONTTNURFD )

DR ROSS (CONT’D)
Yes

ADAM
I’m so sorry I didn’t follow that
Is there something wrong with me

DR ROSS
(points to MRI)
If you look here on your MRI you
see this cephalopod-like object
spreading down along your spinal
column

Adam squints It all looks the same
DR ROSS (CONTD)
That is a massive schwannoma

neurofibrosarcoma

ADAM
I’m sorry I still don’t--

DR ROSS
It’s a malignant tumor

ADAM
A tumor

DR ROSS
Yes

ADAM
Me

DR ROSS
Yes

ADAM

That doesn’t make senseI don’t
smoke I don’t drink I recycle

DR ROSS
Well your case it’s actually quite
fascinating Your cancer is the
result of an incredibly rare gene
mutation in chromosome 17p in the
p53 gene that causes the growth of
malignant cells in tissue around
the nerves In your case it’s grown
along the nerves in your lower
spine

Adam walks over to the window and peers out

(CONTTNURFD )

DR ROSS

People can go years without knowing
they’re sick We’re lucky we caught
it before it metastasizes Given
the placement and size of your
particular tumor the wisest course
of action is to see if we can
possibly reduce this thing down to
a more managable size

(Beat)
I’m going to put you on a four
month regimen of chemotherapy

(beat)
Now Chemotherapy can result in
fertility issues--

ADAM
But I’m going to be okay

Dr Ross puts on his best act of reassurance His words
seemingly genuine his tone is anything but

DR ROSS (CONT’D)
If you need to talk to someone
We have an excellent staff of
social workers and psychologists
here in the hospital They
specialize in casesin
thesesort of matters They’1ll be
able to help you

are

Dr Ross continues to talk as Adam looks out of the window

(CONTTNURFD )

He stares at the screen This is not good Everyone else is
leaving for the day shutting off lights Adam stays
immobile and alone

INT BUS - NIGHT

KYLE
Good talk

Kyle begins walking away from the coffee shop

ADAM
You don’t want coffee

KYLE
I’m awake now

EXT ADAM’S HOUSE - DAY

Adams mother DIANE LERNER steps out of her car and
onto the curb where she’s greeted by her son

ADAM
Hi Mom

DIANE
Hi Honey

She gives Adam a big hug and kiss Based on his body
language it’s clear Diane’s very existence annoys the shit
out of Adam

RICHARD LERNER wanders out from behind Diane On first
glance he seems like a perfectly normal middle aged man but
on closer examination it’s clear that Alzheimers has altered
his sense of reality He extends his hand to Adam

ADAM
Hi Dad
RICHARD
Hi I’m Richard
DIANE
(to Richard)
This is Adam -- your son Remember

Adam shakes his dad’s hand and gives him an awkward pat on
the shoulder It’s clear Richard makes Adam uncomfortable

RICHARD
Adam

Meanwhile Rachael stands on the porch awkward smile
plastered on her face

RACHAEL

(from porch)

Adam walk toward the house

DIANE (CONTD)
She’s not pregnant

Adam stops turns and looks at his mother

ADAM

Adam cringes totally mortified He stares at her for a beat
then turns and walks into the house shaking his head

As Diane follows behind she notices the paint on Adam’s porch
is chipping

DIANE (CONTD)
You need to talk to your landlord
about painting this

ADAM

Adam rolls his eyes and walks
INSIDE
Diane follows after him

Adam nods Diane’s face literally crumples She tries to
compose herself

DIANE

ADAM

(CONTTNURFD )

Adam looks over at Rachel who notices
RACHAEL
(hesitates)

Me I will I’m going to take care

of him
Diane sits motionless for what seems like an eternity The
only indication that she’s not dead is the movement of her
index finger which twitches uncontrollably Adam sits
uneasy trying to anticipate his mother’s next move

ADAM (CONTD)
Mom

Diane calmly rises from her seat and heads to the
KITCHEN
Adam follows after her

ADAM (CONTD)
Mom what are you doing

Diane lights the stove puts up a kettle

DIANE
I’m making you green tea

ADAM

Diane holds up the package of Green Tea
DIANE
I saw on “The Today Show” that it
reduces your risk of getting cancer
by fifteen percent

ADAM
Well -- I already have cancer

Adam puts his arm on his mother’s shoulder

ADAM
Please come back to the table

Diane hugs him and begins to weep
INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Adam walks down the corridor and stops at a reception desk

(CONTTNURFD )

ADAM
I’m looking for Dr McKay

THE ATTENDANT silently points to an office a few doors down

INT HOSPITAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is a pit of chaos small with stacks of psychology
books and files strewn about An attractive young woman
KATHERINE sits on the couch reading a file while she
eats a rather messy sandwich She like her office is
scattered in appearance She takes a bite of her sandwich as
Adam pokes his head in the door She looks up-

KATHERINE
(mouth full of food)
Can I help you

ADAM
I have an appointment with Dr
McKay

KATHERINE
Oh please come in

Katherine removes her files from the couch while awkwardly
balancing her sandwich on top She rises and puts her hand
out to shake Adam’s - he reluctantly shakes it

KATHERINE
and please call me Katherine

ADAM
(confused)
You’re Dr McKay

KATHERINE
I am Have a sit
(corrects herself)
Sit down please

Katherine wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away Adam
looks her up and down

ADAM
Aren’t you supposed to be like
sixty-five and wear earth-toned
sweaters

KATHERINE
(slightly defensive)
Why Did someone say that’s what I
look like

(CONTTNURFD )

ADAM
No But if you don’t mindHow
old are you

KATHERINE
(put off)
Twenty-four

ADAM
Twenty-four What are you like
Doogie Howser

KATHERINE
Who

ADAM
Doogie Howser

Off Katherine’s blank look

ADAM (CONTD)
--The teenage doctor

KATHERINE
Does he work here

ADAM
No Nevermindbut aren’t you too
young to be a doctor

KATHERINE

(almost laughing)
Oh technically I’m not a doctor
yet I wish I’m actually working
on my doctorate

(off Adam’s look trying

to be serious)
This is a training hospital

ADAM
I seeSo have you had many
patients

KATHERINE

My patient history is not--
ADAM
(shocked)
I’m your first patient aren’t I

KATHERINE
No Not at all

(CONTTNURFD )

ADAM
Your second
ADAM (CONTD)
Third

Katie looks at him in silent acceptance Adam’s eyes widen
with concern

ADAM (CONTD)
How are the first two doing

Katherine doesn’t answer She bites her tongue

KATHERINE
Can’t talk about that

ADAM
And this is like part of your
training

KATHERINE

It’ll be part of my dissertation
But don’t worry I’m not gonna use
your real name

ADAM
(uncomfortable)
Okay I guess that’s fine

An awkward beat Katherine pulls Adam’s file

KATHERINE
So Dr Ross filled me in on your
situation This must be incredibly
difficult

Adam shrugs

KATHERINE (CONTD)
How are you feeling

ADAM
You know honestly I feel fine
I’ve actually never been more calm

KATHERINE
(proud of herself)
That’s a very common symptom found
in patients like yourself Right
now your body is in survival mode
What you’re actually experiencing
is shock

(CONTTNURFD )

ADAM
No I think I’m fine

KATHERINE
--That’s why you feel that sense
of calm Would you describe what
youre feeling as a kind of
“numbness”

ADAM
I would describe it as fine

KATHERINE
Because certain patients--

ADAM
(defiant)
I feel great

Katherine bites her tongue

KATHERINE
Wonderful I think that’s wonderful
-- if it’s alright with you today
Id like to start with some very
simple relaxation exercises

Adam nods tense

ADAM
But I am relaxed
KATHERINE
I know you are But if you want to
lie down
ADAM
Lie down
KATHERINE

Yeah

Adam clearly doesn’t trust her but lies down Katherine
presses play on her laptop - playing new agey meditation

music

KATHERINE

retired race dog

ADAM

Adam as he pops a macaroon in his mouth

ADAM
I don’t do weed

ALAN
C’mon Just get high with us

Adam reluctantly eats a macaroon Mitch leans over stoned as
hell

MITCH
How old are you

ADAM
Twenty-seven

(CONTTNURFD )

ALAN
That’s just the worst A perfectly
good youth wasted

MITCH
Alan stop it Don’t listen to him
hes just messing with you

ALAN

(To Adam)
Listen to me this cancer is bull
shit First your hair’s going to
fall out then your balls’1l
shrink And if that isn’t enough
your dick becomes a constant source
of disappointment

Alan and Mitch laugh like two teenagers

ADAM
I got to tell you I was really
nervous about this whole cancer
thing and then I met you guys and
boy do I feel better

Alan and Mitch laugh

ALAN
(to Adam)
I’m Alan Lombardo stage 3
lymphoma Pleased to meet you

MITCH
Mitch Barnett metastatic prostate
cancer

ADAM

Oh I’m Adam Lerner schwannoma
neurofibrosarcoma

ALAN
What the fuck is that

MITCH
Tough break The more syllables
the worse it is

Alan and Mitch laugh Adam pops another macaroon in his
mouth

ADAM
These are really good

(CONTTNURFD )

MITCH
Thanks my wife made ‘em

ADAM
(chewing)
--how strong are they

ALAN
Stroooong

Adam sits back and closes his eyes Upbeat music swells

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER

Adam walks in SLOW MOTION down the same ominous corridor he
entered through before Only it’s no longer ominous to him
He wears a big huge goofy smirk on his face as he passes
--a SICK MAN on a gurney

--an OLD LADY wheezing

--a BODY BAG being carted on a gurney

--a FAMILY crying

Adam stops stares at all the misery around and laughs

INT ADAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam jolts out of bed His clothes are drenched in sweat He
quickly runs into the bathroom and throws up A lot

Rachael wakes up and knows she should go to him but can’t
Instead she faintly calls out-

RACHAEL
Adam you okay

Adam says nothing he just slumps over the toilet seat and

throws up again

INT HOSPITAL OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Adam looks and feels terrible His head pounds causing him

to rub it Katherine sits in the chair next to him Her tone

is a little rigid - masking her lack of experience
KATHERINE

So how are you feeling after your
first treatment

(CONTTNURFD )

ADAM
It feels pretty bad gotta say My
head is killing me

KATHERINE
(empathetic)
Yeah I know From what I understand
it can be pretty rough But it will
pass

She pats Adam on the arm Her intention is to set Adam at
ease but the act just makes him more uncomfortable
Startled he backs away

ADAM
Uhhuh

KATHERINE
I think it’s important to remember
that these side effects are very
normal

ADAM
Good I’d hate to think I was
special in any way

KATHERINE
(nervous )
That’s not what I meant I was just
trying to reassure you

ADAM
(terse)
Well thanks

KATHERINE
I’m sensing some anger Which is
good

ADAM
I’m not angry
(beat)
Why is that good

KATHERINE
Because you’re expressing yourself
Youre dealing with a really
serious illness That brings up a
lot of emotions

ADAM

Youre trying to make me freak out
right That’s the goal here

(CONTTNURFD )

KATHERINE
I’m not trying to make you freak
out I just want you to get in
touch with what’s going on inside
And if you’re angry--

ADAM
(angry)
I’m not angryLet’s do the
relaxation thing Can we do that

I want to hear some sitars Go to
my happy place and feel the warm of
beam of light Can we do that

Katherine’s a little shaken by Adam’s outburst He feels bad -
although that outburst did feel kind of good

KATHERINE
I see

ADAM (CONTD)
(beat)
Im sorryI was being an asshole
I didn’t mean to say that

Katherine regains her footing

KATHERINE
I don’t need you to take care of
me
(smiles)

I’m trying to take care of you

Adam nods hesitant Katherine exhales and scribbles on a
piece of paper

KATHERINE (CONTD)
Listen there’s a few books I’d
like you to read A lot of people
find them really helpful You don’t
have to read them cover-to-cover
Just take a look to see if they
resonate

She pats her hand on Adam’s shoulder
ADAM
I’m sorry are you going to keep

touching me like that

KATHERINE
What This

(CONTTNURFD )

Katherine puts her hand back on Adam’s shoulder Adam pulls
away

ADAM
Yeah That

KATHERINE
(frustrated)
I’m trying to help you
feel more at ease

Adam imitates Katherine’s touching

ADAM
That’s supposed to make me feel
more at ease It’s like being
slapped by a sea otter

KATHERINE
Touching promotes trust It’s one

of the key ways that hospital
practitioners can help patients
feel more secure in stressful
situations

ADAM
That’s um it’s not -- comforting
Sorry

KATHERINE
Really sea otter Is this better

Katherine tries again This time it’s too gentle

ADAM
Now it’s just getting creepy

INT ADAM’S BATHROOM - DAY

Adam stands in front of the mirror Kyle stands behind him
tying a towel around his neck

KYLE
I think you’re making a big big
mistake Please don’t do this

ADAM
What are you talking about

KYLE
What if you have some weird
Gorbachev bird shit thing on your
head

(CONTTNURFD )

ADAM
I thought you liked this idea

KYLE
I liked the idea in theory Now
that we’re standing here about to
do it I’m a little worried you’re
going to look like fucking Michael
Stipe

ADAM
We have to do it

KYLE
I’m not going to do it

ADAM
You said you would

KYLE
I changed my mind - because if it
looks bad you’ll blame me every
time you see your weird screwed up
bald head

Adam grabs the PAIR OF CLIPPERS and goes in for the shave He
pauses

ADAM
Waitwhat do you use this for

Adams eyes widen

KYLE
You know my body

ADAM
When was the last time you cleaned
it
Kyle wipes the clippers on his shirt

KYLE
Right now

Adam takes the clippers and proceeds to shave his head Kyle
covers his eyes in horror

KYLE
Fuck Dude Holy Shit

After a beat Kyle grabs the trimmers and joins in

Once finished Adam looks at his bald head in the mirror

(CONTTNURFD )

ADAM
It looks okay right

KYLE
No It looks really weird

ADAM
Why didn’t we go to a barber

KYLE
That would have been a much better
idea -- if we had paid someone to
do it

ADAM

Instead of using your balls trimmer-

KYLE
And I never wash them ever And
it’s not my balls it’s my
assholeI’m joking

ADAM
You’re not joking

KYLE
No I’m not

ADAM
Well it’s midni-

KYLE (CONTD)

Adam’s taken aback by Katherine’s bluntness

ADAM
Well yeah I guess

KATHERINE
I mean aren’t you being kind of a
dick

ADAM

I’m sorry Is that a medical term

(CONTTNURFD )

KATHERINE
Your parents are who they are you

you can change is how you choose to
deal with them

ADAM
Aren’t you supposed to subtly
manipulate me into being aware of
my faults Not call me out

KATHERINE
I think we’re beyond that point
You did clean my car

Katherine looks at Adam with tenderness grabs hold of his
shoulder squeezing it

KATHERINE (CONTD)

Not expecting this turn from Adam Katherine’s demeanor
stiffens - she looks anxious

KATHERINE
Adam okay what you’re going
through - is something called “The
Alienation Phase”And I know
that you’re feeling helpless
inside but you should know that
this is totally normal for someone
in your situation

ADAM
(annoyed)

I’m sorry but I’m going to have
to call you on that It’s bullshit
That’s what everyone has been
saying “You’ll get better” and
“Itll be fine”

(MORE )

(CONTTNURFD )

ADAM (contd)
I don’t know why everyone is so
fucking scared to say it “You’re
dying dude”It makes it worse

KATHERINE
(speechless)
Adam I’m here to help you

ADAM
Why So that when you’re at some
dinner party in 30 years you can
tell some inspiring anecdote about
you coached your third patient
through the alienation phase and
helped him feel “normal” right
before he died

FRIENDLY NURSE
The doctor’s just in with another
patient but should be out in a few
minutes You guys holding up

DIANE
It’s very cold in here Is there
anyway you can turn down the air
conditioning

FRIENDLY NURSE
Unfortunately the temperature is
controlled by a central thermostat

DIANE
My son has cancer

FRIENDLY NURSE
(feels bad)
I’m sorry really if I could I
would but there’s nothing I can
do

Adam’s pissed that his mother has just involved him

ADAM
(smiles to the Nurse)
Don’t worry about it
(Scowls at Diane)
I’m fine

FRIENDLY NURSE
Are you sure I could get you a

blanket

you

DIANE

(CONTTNURFD )

FRIENDLY NURSE

The Nurse smiles and then exits

DIANE
(Re the friendly Nurse)
I don’t like her

Diane puts her hand on Adam’s forehead

DIANE (CONTD)
You feel warm

ADAM
I’m fine

Diane gets up from her chair and paces around the room
looking at the doctor’s various degrees on the wall Adam
looks on annoyed at every step his mother takes Diane
closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading
glasses for further examination

DIANE
(disapproving)
Huh
ADAM

DIANE

Oh nothing

ADAM
(annoyed)

DIANE
It’s nothing he went to a state
college

ADAM
You’re unbelievable

DIANE
I just worry that you’re not
getting the best care possible
(beat)
And I don’t think you’re eating
right

Adam can’t take it anymore He explodes

(CONTTNURFD )

ADAM
Will you stop I’m not him I can
take care of myself

Diane is so frustrated she’s near tears

DIANE
It’s so hard that you don’t let me
help you It’s really hard

ADAM
You are helping me You brought me
here didn’t you

They sit in silence for a moment

ADAM (CONTD)
What about you

She looks at him baffled

DIANE
What about me

ADAM
How are you

DIANE
(wiping her tears)
How am I

ADAM
How are you What’s going on in
your life

DIANE
Seriously Nothing is going on in
my life The highlight of my week
is this cancer support group I’ve
been going to

ADAM
Youve been going to a support
group

DIANE
It’s for parents whose kids have
cancer

ADAM

I didn’t know you were doing that

(CONTTNURFD )

DIANE
How would you You never call me
back

He looks at her He softens

ADAM
I’m sorry

DIANE
You don’t have to say you’re sorry

Adam takes her hand in his She’s clearly moved A beat Dr
Ross storms into the room carrying a stack of MRI films He
seems rushed

DR ROSS
Sorry to keep you folks waiting

Adam and Diane look at Dr Ross with blank stares

DR ROSS (CONTD)
Anyway I’1l cut to the chase The
cancer’s not responding to the
chemo

Dr Ross places the MRI into the light box

DR ROSS (CONT’D)
As you can see the tumor is
continuing to grow here along the
nerve We have to remove it now or
we risk metastasis

Adam and Diane squint to see what Ross is talking about but
see nothing

ADAM
So what do we do

DR ROSS
We need to operate Now
I was able to move some things
around and I can get you in this
Thursday morning with Dr
Walderson He’s one of our best
neurosurgeons

DIANE

But he’s going to be okay right
You’re going to fix it

(CONTTNURFD )

DR ROSS
Considering the placement and size
of the tumor a surgery of this
nature is very dangerous and
potentially life threatening
itself The surgeons will be very
aggressive in their attempt But if
we’re unsuccessful in removing the
cancerthen unfortunately we’re
out of options

Diane takes hold of Adam’s hand They sit silently as the
doctor’s words soak in

EXT PARK - LATER THAT NIGHT

Adam sitting in the park over looking the city Kyle is drunk

Adam locks the doors and sits quietly for a moment He then
proceeds to scream at the top of his lungs Twenty seven
years worth of suppressed emotions come out Adam then sits
in total silence After a beat he pulls out his cell phone
Kyle notices He tries to open the door It’s locked Adam
ignores Kyle and begins to dial

KYLE (CONT’D)

enters the room and sits across from the others They
exchange awkward looks

DIANE
(to Kyle)
It’s been five hours

Kyle looks over clearly very aware of that fact

KYLE
Has it

DIANE
Something’s wrong We should have
heard by now

KYLE
Don’t worry Adam’s going to be
fine okay

Katherine hears Adam’s name She leans over to Kyle Richard
and Diane

KATHERINE
Adam Lerner

KYLE
(startled)
Yeah

KATHERINE
Dr Walderson is one of the best
surgeons in the country so he’s in
good hands

DIANE
Who are you

(CONTTNURFD )

KATHERINE
Iuh I’m Katherine

KYLE
The therapist I’m Kyle Adams
friend
They shake hands
KYLE

These are Adams parents

KATHERINE
It’s nice to meet you

She smiles and nods awkwardly Long beat

KYLE
Did he say I was a dick ‘Cause I’m
not

DIANE

I want you to know I smothered him
because I love him

Katherine smiles politely

KYLE
Seriously did he say anything

KATHERINE
II can’tI wouldn’t1I
wouldn’t talk about that sort of
thing

Kyle and Diane turn their attention away from Katherine
dejected In the distance they spot Dr Walderson Everyone
jumps up as she approaches

DR WALDERSON
Mr and Mrs Lerner So as you can
imagine with a surgery of this
magnitudethere were some
unforeseen complications The bone
erosion was much greater than
initially anticipated We had to
remove part of the hip and pelvis
as well as most of the right psoas
muscle We also had to remove a
good amount of sheath tissue around
the sciatic nerve It’s not going
to be an easy road back but he’s
going to be okay

(CONTTNURFD )

DIANE
(relieved)
He’s going to be okay

Dr Walderson nods
KYLE
You should start with that
information That should be the
first thing you say

He turns to hug Diane

KYLE (CONTD)
He’s OK

Diane and Kyle hug then pull Richard into the hug
DIANE
(to Dr Walderson)
Thank you doctor thank you

Diane and Kyle start crying Katherine sees this tender
moment and shies away

INT HOSPITAL POST-OP RECOVERY - DAY

Adam’s in his hospital bed - still asleep from the surgery
Richard and Diane enter the room Adam reacts like a little
kid being picked up from pre-school

ADAM (CONTD)
Mommy
DIANE
(crying)
My little boy

ADAM
It’s nice here I got a good room

DIANE

ADAM

DIANE
Yes we’ll go on a huge vacation
We can go to Hawaii

Kyle awkwardly stands over Adam trying to act normal

(CONTTNURFD )

KYLE
Hey man What’s upI’m afraid to
touch you but um--

Adam sticks out his pinkie which Kyle gently fist bumps

KYLE
Boom You look really good

ADAM
I’m high as a motherfucka

Kyle looks at Diane with a guilty expression

KYLE
Umwe don’t do that

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Adam lies in bed His eyes open staring at the ceiling It’s
quiet Peaceful Katherine knocks on the door and walks in
Adam speaks woozy from the morphine and very weak

ADAM
It’s you

KATHERINE
It is me

She stands next to the bed

KATHERINE
How are you feeling

ADAM
Grrreat I love morphineWhat
time is it

KATHERINE
It’s eight o’clock I was just
working late so I thought I’d stop
by

ADAM
(wide smile)
Working late - you got a new
patient

KATHERINE
I got a few new patients actually

ADAM
That’s good

(CONTTNURFD )

Adam smiles Looks into her eyes for a long beat

ADAM
Id like to make you pancakes some
time

KATHERINE

That’s very nice Adam

ADAM
(dead serious)
Youre going to like them

Katherine laughs She sits next to him on the bed and takes
hold of his hand Unlike her previous attempts this time her
grip is perfect Adam notices

ADAM
I’m peeing right now

KATHERINE
I’m not going to look

We stay on Adam and Katherine looking into each other’s eyes
as Katherine moves her hand down his arm finally clasping
his hand in hers

IE ADAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

CLOSE-UP ON WOUND

ANGLE ON Kyle staring at the wound with trepidation
absolutely disgusted

KYLE
Ugh it’s gross Oh God - I keep
looking back at it thinking it’s
going to be less gross

The wound is revealed to be on Adam’s back Adam -- hair
slowly beginning to grow back looking much healthier
relaxed -- looks back at Kyle
ADAM
Can we just get it over with Come
on
KYLE

Your mom does this

ADAM
She does it all the time

(CONTTNURFD )

KYLE
This is like some “Saw” shit

ADAM
(unaffected)
Your words are so comforting

KYLE
I’m just gonna do it I’m gonna act
like it’s nothing

Kyle puts a gob of antibiotic ointment on his finger and very
tentatively reaches towards Adam’s back

ADAM
I’m going to be really proud of
you

KYLE

Ugh I’m doing it I’m inside you

Adam looks over his shoulder notices Kyle applying the
ointment

ADAM
Wait wait wait is that your
finger

KYLE
What

ADAM
Is that your finger

KYLE

(guilty)

No

ADAM

There’s Q-Tips

KYLE
I know I know

Kyle quickly applies some ointment on a Q-TIP

ADAM
That was your finger wasn’t it

KYLE
Would it be bad if it was

ADAM
Did you wash your hands

(CONTTNURFD )

KYLE
I used a Q-Tip the whole time
don’t worry about it

Kyle swabs the wound with the Q-Tip
KYLE
This looks like Kuato from “Total
Recall”

Adam grabs his back to imitate Kuato

ADAM
The oxygen

KYLE
(disgusted)
No Don’t do that Ugh

Kyle feebly applies the DRESSING on Adam’s wound
ADAM

Can we get this going It’s seven
thirty Come on put on the

bandage
Kyle gingerly applies the bandage whilst turning his head
Wound now covered Kyle looks self-assured -- it’s a pretty
shoddy job
KYLE

And you are ready for your date

Adam gingerly stands and buttons up his shirt He walks over
and looks in the mirror He rubs his short hair in
contemplation

ADAM
It’s crazy I look pretty good

KYLE
Id fuck you

ADAM
(smiles)
Thanks

The DOORBELL rings Adam looks at Kyle a bit nervous
KYLE (CONTD)
(excited)

(CONTTNURFD )

Adam takes a deep breath and opens the front door He lights
up when he sees KATHERINE standing in front of him She’s
holding a PIZZA

ADAM

KATHERINE

KATHERINE

(awkward beat)

ADAM
(smiles)

KATHERINE

Kyle clears his throat and waves meekly from the corner

ADAM
You remember Kyle

KYLE
Good to see youI see you brought
a pizza which is good because I
havent fed him all day I just
changed the dressing on his wound
There’s Vicodin in the bathroom if
you need it I know people take it
recreationally but he actually
needs it for his aches--

Adam stares at Kyle blankly Katherine looks to Adam unsure
how to react

KATHERINE
(dead serious)
Are there channels he can’t watch

Katherine cracks a smile Kyle beams

(CONTTNURFD )

KYLE

(to Adam)
That’s funny

(to Katherine)

Adam opens the door and ushers Kyle out

ADAM
Dude you’re awesome
KYLE
Alright

Kyle moves toward the door and whispers to Adam-

KYLE (CONT’D)

Adam smiles and closes the door on Kyle Adam then turns
around and looks at Katherine

KATHERINE
