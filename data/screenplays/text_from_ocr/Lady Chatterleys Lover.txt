in health

INT SIR MALCOLM’S HOME CONNIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

Connie’s sister HILDA helps Connie change out of her
wedding gown They are both laughing feeling the effects of
the cocktails they sip

HILDA
How does it feel

CONNIE
I don’t know Ask me tomorrow
(As she struggles with her
wedding gown )
I need to get out of this dress

Hilda helps Connie change into a more flattering ‘Bohemian’
dress Connie studies herself in the mirror

CONNIE (CONTD)
How do I look

HILDA
I doubt Clifford will want to stay
long at the reception

Connie smirks She sits at a dressing table Hilda begins
fixing Connie’s hair
CONNIE
You don’t think Clifford’s mother
would have approved

HILDA
I’m not entirely sure I do

CONNIE
Are we talking about the dress now
Hilda Or the marriage

HILDA

Oh stop it Connie I shouldn’t
have said anything - it’s been a
whirlwind that’s all

CONNIE
Clifford goes back to the front in
the morning Imagine if we waited
and something terrible happened

HILDA
Couldn’t you have just had sex with
him

CONNIE
(She laughs )
Be serious

HILDA
I am It’s much less commitment
and it’s all most men want anyway

CONNIE
Cliffords not like that He’s
kind he’s thoughtful and he makes
me feel safe His family is more
traditional than ours I suppose
but his own views are quite
progressive

HILDA
Really Does he know about that
German boy of yours

CONNIE
Yes He said it didn’t matter - and
it shouldn’t It was before the war-

HILDA
You don’t have to convince me I
had my own German boy
CONNIE
Yes well mine is dead

HILDA
That’s just it Connie - I don’t
want to see you get hurt again You
open your heart so easily -

CONNIE
I do not For heaven’s sake -

CLIFFORD (0S)
Reinforcements have arrived

Clifford enters carrying drinks

CONNIE
(Reaching for her drink)
And you’ve read my mind

CLIFFORD
I nearly drank yours on the way up

HILDA
Oh dear What now

CLIFFORD
Our fathers are preparing their
toasts Mine is making patriotic
speeches about the war effort to my
ushers most of whom are being held
together with bandages

CONNIE
Shall we face them together then

CLIFFORD
Of course
(He grins admiring her
dress)
You look stunning Connie

INT SIR MALCOLM’S HOME - DAY

FAMILY and FRIENDS including men in uniform have gathered
downstairs for a small wedding reception A PIANIST plays

Connie and Clifford appear on the steps to applause They
come downstairs to greet their fathers - SIR GEOFFREY
CHATTERLEY (70s frail wears a black armband) and Connie’s
father SIR MALCOLM REID (50s in a kilt) Sir Geoffrey
raises his glass
SIR GEOFFREY
(Clearly inebriated )
To Clifford and Connie - our new
hope for an heir to Wragby

Others raise their glasses as well Geoffrey’s toast rankles
Clifford though he does his best to remain civil

CLIFFORD
Please Father - that’s not why we
married

SIR GEOFFREY
Why else has a baronet ever
married

CLIFFORD
I married because I found Connie

CONNIE
And I you

The crowd approves Malcolm raises a hand gestures toward a
wedding cake

SIR MALCOLM
We would like to thank those who
donated their butter and sugar

Laughter Geoffrey interrupts Malcolm growing emotional

SIR GEOFFREY
We have all sacrificed so much to
protect our traditions So much

Everyone toasts The pianist plays a foxtrot all watch as
Clifford and Connie dance their first dance together

INT CONNIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Connie sits on the bed in her nightgown Clifford is just
visible in the adjoining dressing room preparing for bed

CLIFFORD
“Why else has a baronet ever
married” Unbelievable
(MORE)
CLIFFORD (CONTD)
If he really cared about his
legacy he wouldn’t have shoved two
sons and half his workers into
battle

CONNIE
Do you want children Clifford

CLIFFORD
(Entering the bedroom )
Some day But for our sake not my
Father’s Assuming you would

CONNIE
I would yes In time

Clifford stops overcome with shyness at the sight of Connie

CLIFFORD
Look at you then Lady Chatterley

CONNIE
(Smirking )
That will take getting used to

Connie pulls the curtains and leads Clifford over to the bed
Clifford sits anxious He kisses her Connie leads his hand
to her breast he abruptly pulls away

CONNIE (CONTD)
Are you alright -

CLIFFORD
No it’s - sorry I can’t stop
thinking about going back to the
front I know I’1l1 be fine but -

CONNIE
We don’t have to do anything

CLIFFORD
No I - I want to

Clifford moves closer hesitant Connie kisses him and pulls
him down onto the bedcovers positioning him over her

EXT MALCOLM’S HOME - DAY

The next morning Clifford and Connie come out the front
entrance of Malcolm’s house Clifford is in uniform and
carries a kit bag A CHAUFFEUR hurries forward to take the
kit bag and put it in the boot of his waiting car

Clifford turns to face Connie trying to find the right words
to say goodbye

CONNIE
You’re sure you don’t want me to
see you off at the station
CLIFFORD
Thanks - let’s not make a ceremony
of it shall we

Connie embraces him Beat Clifford grows emotional and pulls
away trying to keep his emotions in check

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
I love you Con

Connie watches uneasily as Clifford gets in the car The
Chauffeur closes the door and climbs into the driver’s seat

ON CONNIE’S FACE as she speaks to Clifford through the open
side window of the car -

CONNIE
I look forward to your letters

CLIFFORD
I’1l write to you every day

The engine starts Connie watches as the car drives away
FADE OUT THEN
IE A MOTORCARARCHIVAL WW1l FOOTAGE - MONTAGE
As Clifford is driven off to the front an old 78 rpm record
plays a rousing rendition of “Keep the Home Fires Burning”
ARCHIVAL FILM FOOTAGE plays against the window of his car
soldiers smile waving at the camera they march in formation
and bayonet piles of hay practicing

As the song continues we begin to see ACTUAL BATTLE FOOTAGE

- Men charge back and forth across barb-wired fields
scrambling in terror as bombs explode all around

- Hollow-eyed soldiers gaze up out of trenches
- Tanks roll into battle planes fly overhead bombs fall

- A bomb hits a building destroying it The MUSIC STOPS
IE A MOTORCARTEVERSHALL WINTER - DAY

Time has passed snow now covers the landscape Clifford and
Connie ride through the countryside in their chauffeured car

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
Dearest Hilda I knew the war would
change us all but I just wasn’t
sure how much It feels as though
it ended half a lifetime ago not
half a year

A small grim village comes into view The smokestacks of the
nearby coal mine tower over humble dwellings the snow is
covered in soot ash Exhausted men walk along the road women
and children stare out from doorways

Connie looks vaguely troubled as she takes in the town

CONNIE (LETTER VO) (CONTD)
We’ve already moved away from
London and we’ve just arrived at
Wragby Clifford’s family estate

IE THE MOTORCARWRAGBY WINTER - DAY

The car pulls up before Wragby a brown manse showing signs
of neglect The housekeeper and her husband MR and MRS
WARREN stand out front bowing as the car arrives

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
Once we’re settled in I expect to
write you often
(Signing off)
Your loving sister Connie

Mr Warren rolls a wheelchair over to the car and opens
Clifford’s door Clifford whose legs are now paralyzed
tries to get into the chair with as little help as possible

MRS WARREN
Welcome home Sir Clifford We’ve
been praying for you

Once Clifford is seated Mr Warren starts to push the
wheelchair Clifford holds up a hand to stop him

CLIFFORD
No - I can manage thank you
(Gesturing to Connie )
Mr and Mrs Warren this is my
wife the new Lady Chatterley
MRS WARREN
(Bowing again)
It is so nice to meet you m’lady

CLIFFORD
Where are all the other servants

MRS WARREN
Your father’s lawyers let the
others go But plenty are looking
for work now that the war is over

CLIFFORD
Good There’s plenty of work to be
done Hire back all the workers you
can Mrs Warren we’ll replace the
rest
(Glancing to the house)
The old girl has seen better days

Connie takes in the home’s disrepair She nods determined

CONNIE
Well bring her back to life

INT WRAGBY ENTRYCLIFFORD’S BEDROOMLIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Everyone enters Wragby’s grand main entry hall Connie takes
in the stuffy austere surroundings

MRS WARREN
We thought you might like to use
your father’s old study as the
master bedroom so you don’t have to
bother with all the stairs

Clifford wheels himself over to a side door that leads into a
library He nods turns to Mr Warren and the Chauffeur

CLIFFORD
No put the luggage in here - we’ll
use the library as the master

Connie enters a dreary room filled to the brim with academic
texts and furniture covered in sheets

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
What could be more inspiring for a
writer than to sleep among books

Connie crosses to Clifford who gazes at an old worn chair
He glances up smiles to avoid being maudlin
CLIFFORD (CONTD)
This is where they found Father
They said his heart gave out I
think he died of chagrin

Connie squeezes his shoulder her heart going out to him

CONNIE
That’s all done Clifford Life is
what we make of it now
(Turning to Mrs Warren)
Could you open some curtains Mrs
Warren We need light in here

MRS WARREN
Of course m’lady

Connie nods her thanks taking in her new surroundings
Clifford notices her unease

CLIFFORD

You should have a look around
CONNIE

I will
CLIFFORD

Youre welcome to use the private
room above the library with all of
the family portraits -

(Finding this amusing)
You can have the whole of the
second floor now I think of it

Connie smiles reassuringly kissing him on the forehead

CONNIE
Welcome home Clifford

Clifford watches her as she goes upstairs

INT CONNIE’S CHAMBERS - DAY

Connie enters a dim Victorian bedroom She draws the
curtains then notices the family photographs that line the

walls

A picture of Cliffords mother gazes sternly at Connie from
over the bed

INT CLIFFORD’S ROOM - NIGHT

LATER - Connie stands before Clifford trying to figure out
how to best move him from his wheelchair to the mattress
Together they struggle to move him Eventually they succeed

CONNIE
I think I’m getting the hang of it

Clifford unbuttons his shirt Connie gets Clifford’s pajamas
from one of their trunks and brings them over

CLIFFORD
You know I’ve been thinking of
expanding on my short story about
Cambridge turning it into a novel

CONNIE
Oh that’s a wonderful idea I
can’t wait to read it

CLIFFORD
Youll be my editor

Clifford puts on the pajama top Connie helps him out of his
trousers revealing raw scars that cover his legs and torso

CONNIE
Of course Typist proofreader -
I’1l submit my application

CLIFFORD
Ill kick it to the top of the
pile

Connie loses her balance as she slides his pajama bottoms up
nearly toppling onto him She laughs landing beside him

CONNIE
The bed is softer than I imagined
(Staring at the ceiling)
First night at Wragby

Clifford smiles amused Connie turns to him their faces
suddenly close She puts a hand on Clifford’s torso tenderly
tracing the web of scars with her fingertips She kisses them
gently slowly making her way up to his lips Clifford kisses
her back nervous - Connie takes his hand and guides it
between her legs

Suddenly Clifford stiffens and pulls away

CLIFFORD
I’m sorry Con I just can’t
anymore I’m so sorry

CONNIE
It’s alright Don’t worry

CLIFFORD
Youll be fine

Connie nods hiding hurt She settles in beside him
uncertain as Clifford reaches to turn out the light

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
This is misfortune but you’ll see
We’ll be happy here At Wragby

Clifford flips the switch casting them into darkness

father before the war

MELLORS
(Midlands accent )
Aye sir

CLIFFORD
(Off the CV surprised )
You were an army lieutenant

MELLORS
I was

CLIFFORD
Do you honestly believe returning
to life as a gamekeeper will be
satisfying after your time as an
officer

MELLORS
Bit of quiet’d do me good I seen
enough what war does to men

CLIFFORD
- As have I Very well then
Welcome back Mr Mellors

Back in the DINING ROOM Connie continues to look over Lily’s
qualifications

CONNIE
You must know your way around the
estate better than I do

LILY
Oh no m’lady - I couldn’t visit
while my mother was working

CONNIE
(Takes this in Beat)
In that case we’ll have to learn
our way around together then won’t
we Lily

Lily blinks in surprise realizing she’s just been hired
As soon as Lily departs another woman in her 30s steps up

handing her application to Connie Connie takes it and forces
a smile clearly a bit overwhelmed

MAID
My name is Kelly Martin m’lady
I’ve been a maid for over five
years

PAN TO THE WINDOW as WINTER FADES TO EARLY SPRING

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
Dear Hilda I’m a thoughtless lout
for not writing sooner

EXT WRAGBYSIDE OF THE HOUSE - DAY

EARLY SPRING Connie steps outside taking in the day The
snow is gone as is the scaffolding in front of the house
Birds sing Crocuses burst up along a muddy path

CONNIE (LETTER VO)

enormous amount of tending to but
we finally have a full staff who
have done wonders in restoring the
place

NEAR THE HOUSE the new gardener Betts prunes the bushes
INT CLIFFORDS BEDROOMLIBRARY -— NIGHT

Connie helps Clifford into bed She climbs in after him they

(MORE)

CONNIE (LETTER VO) (CONTD)
But we have to live I suppose - no
matter how many skies have fallen

INT WRAGBY ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

The house is filled with GUESTS all of them men They
discuss politics as cigars smolder in ashtrays Connie sits
by the window smiling politely but keeping her distance

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
We have had some guests mostly
Clifford’s old bachelor friends -
it’s hardly surprising that most of
them haven’t found a woman believe
me Now and again we also get
visits from writers whose advice
Clifford has sought out

Clifford talks with MICHAELIS (30s) an Irish playwright with
a Dublin accent and a taste for fine suits He glances at
Connie who nods to him His gaze lingers She looks away

CONNIE (LETTER VO) (CONTD)
Apparently my old friends all seem
to think misfortune is contagious

INT CONSERVATORY - DAY

Another day Connie sits restless reading a book In the
light of day her features have begun to look drawn weary

INT CLIFFORD’S STUDY - DAY
Clifford is at his desk writing in longhand Connie enters

CONNIE
Am I interrupting -

CLIFFORD
Not at all What is it

CONNIE
I was thinking of going to London
for a few days To visit Hilda

CLIFFORD
And leaving me to fend for myself

CONNIE
You do have a houseful of servants

CLIFFORD
I don’t need servants I need you
Why don’t you invite Hilda to
visit She’d be more than welcome

CONNIE
I have - but she can’t get away
from London for a few weeks

CLIFFORD
I’m glad at least she can come

Beat Connie turns to go

CONNIE
I’m going out for a walk

CLIFFORD
Why We can send Mrs Warren for
anything you want

CONNIE
(With more frustration
than she intends )
I don’t need anything Clifford I
would just like a walk is all

CLIFFORD
(Surprised )
Very well then dear As you like
Connie nods leaves Clifford gazes after her

EXT WRAGBYHILL BY THE SIDE ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Connie slips out the side door and makes her way down the
hillside toward the woods

EXT THE WOODSSTREAM BY A BRIDGE WRAGBY - DAY
Connie strikes out through the woods restless She comes to
a stream that runs beneath a bridge and sits down next to it

running her fingers through the gentle current

Something rustles Connie turns surprised to see an
affectionate dog bounding over to greet her

CONNIE
Hello there

MELLORS (0S)
Flossie Where are you

Connie turns to look just as Mellors appears on the bridge
above calling out toward the other side He wears heavy
boots and carries a rifle

MELLORS (CONTD)
Flossie Come ‘ere lass

Connie quietly gestures for Flossie to go to him As the dog
bounds off toward the bridge Connie rises

UP ON THE BRIDGE Mellors turns as Flossie comes running
towards him the two walking off into the woods Connie
appears at the far end of the bridge watching Mellors go

INT WRAGBY THE BATHROOM - DAY

Clifford sits in his wheelchair in a robe head turned away
in embarrassment as Connie trims his toenails

CONNIE
- And I found a lovely little
stream that runs through the woods -

CLIFFORD
I know the place I doubt I’m able
to get there anymore

CONNIE
I’m sure we could find a way to go
there if you’d like

She rises done Clifford slips out of his robe and rolls
over to the tub which has a board across to help him get in
He prepares to climb into the tub

CONNIE (CONTD)
You ready

Clifford nods Connie puts her arms around Clifford and lifts
him out of the chair He leans over onto the board

CONNIE (CONTD)
Don’t lean away so much

CLIFFORD
Youre going to drop me - let go

CONNIE
I’m not going to drop you

CLIFFORD
Just there we go That’s fine
Just let me go there

Connie does so Clifford slides himself onto the board then
slowly lowers himself the rest of the way in

CONNIE
See You didn’t need my help at
all

Beat He stares at the water

CLIFFORD
There must be times you hate me for
this

CONNIE
What No

CLIFFORD

I wouldn’t blame you There are
days I wish I hadn’t made it back

CONNIE
Clifford Don’t talk like that

Clifford looks up his fear and insecurity showing

CLIFFORD
Id be lost without you you know

CONNIE
(Beat )
Let’s open the windows shall we
Get some fresh air in here

Clifford nods sensing her unease Connie opens the curtains

CONNIE (CONTD)
I don’t think I’ve ever seen the
skies so clear

CLIFFORD
There’s no smoke in the air The
mines are closed for May Day
(A sudden enthusiasm )
You should go down to Tevershall
See the fair You can you know
Just be back in time for tea

CONNIE
Yes I might

EXT THE STREETS OF TEVERSHALL - DAY

A May Day festival Men raise the maypole as onlookers cheer
nearby villagers dance in celebration Connie rides into
town on a bicycle passing wounded veterans children and
families She notices stares from the crowd and dismounts
pushing the bicycle the rest of the way through town

LOCAL WOMEN decorate tables with flowers Connie sees Lily
the new cook laughing with them daisies tucked in her hair
Connie waves Lily notices her lowers her eyes and curtsies
respectfully Connie stiffens nods politely and moves on

A woman MRS FLINT (mid-20s) passes Connie notices that the
child in her arms (JOSEPHINE 1) carries flower necklaces
The child offers one of them to Connie

CONNIE
Oh that’s so kind Thank you

Mrs Flint turns surprised and slightly intimidated

MRS FLINT
Oh Happy May Day to you my Lady

CONNIE
Happy May Day
(Greeting baby Josephine )
Who’s this She’s precious

MRS FLINT
This is my Josephine Can you say
hello to Lady Chatterley

The girl turns away hiding her face Connie laughs

CONNIE
I seem to be having that effect on
people today

MRS FLINT
I’m Mrs Flint I’m a schoolteacher
here in the village

CONNIE
I’m Connie Lovely to meet you

MRS FLINT
My husband leases Marehay Farm from
your estate It’s not far from you

PROTESTORS march through the street singing a protest song

PROTESTORS (0S)
Side by side we fight forever -
More in numbers makes them stop
Just as long as we stand together -

One miner stares directly at Connie as they approach then
pushes her aside as they pass A POLICEMAN grabs him The

miner resists A SECOND POLICEMAN rushes forward and clubs
the man Connie gasps

MRS FLINT
You should come with me my Lady

CONNIE
What was that

Mrs Flint carrying Josephine walks a shaken Connie away
from the protestors Connie pushes her bicycle

MRS FLINT
The miners They’re out protesting
again

CONNIE

Again That happens a lot

MRS FLINT
They must’ve been from one of the
other mines - they’d lose their
jobs if they marched like that
through their own village

CONNIE
Do the Tevershall men go off and
protest in the other villages

MRS FLINT

I wouldn’t know I may teach their
children but I’m an outsider when
it comes to the miner’s wives

CONNIE
That makes two of us

MRS FLINT
(Lightening the mood)
You should come to Marehay one day
Wed love to have you

CONNIE
Id love that Thank you

EXT WRAGBY HILL BY THE SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

Clifford wheels his chair toward the park Connie behind She
notices Mellors and Flossie ahead just over the rise

CONNIE
Where are we going

CLIFFORD
Youve always wanted me to join you
on one of your walks I thought of
somewhere I’d like to show you

He struggles as the chair wheels sink into thick mud

CONNIE
I don’t think your chair was made
for this

CLIFFORD

(Frustrated calling)
Mellors

(As he arrives)
I wondered if you wouldn’t mind
helping us get this chair started
again Connie - have you met
Mellors our new gamekeeper

Mellors removes his hat and bows his manner subservient and
distant Flossie though recognizes Connie and hurries up to
greet her

MELLORS
Flossie Get down there

CONNIE
(As she pets the dog)
It’s all right She’s just being
friendly aren’t you
(To Mellors )
Youve been at Wragby some time
Mr Mellors

MELLORS
Raised here your Ladyship

As Mellors pushes Cliffords chair along the muddy path
Connie notices he is breathing through parted lips his face
pale from the effort

CONNIE
Do you need some help

CLIFFORD
Mellors is perfectly capable of
pushing on his own

Mellors gets the chair back on level ground sets it down

MELLORS
Nothin’ else Sir

CLIFFORD
Nothing else Good day

Clifford wheels himself forward without a backward glance

CONNIE

(To Mellors )
That was kind of you I hope it

wasn’t too heavy

Mellors glances over surprised - his eyes meeting Connie’s
He remembers himself and quickly glances away speaking with
barely a trace of the Midlands accent he affected while
‘playing the role of servant’ moments before

MELLORS
Oh no not heavy Good day to your
Ladyship

He bows slightly turns to leave Connie watches him go
EXT THE KNOLL - DAY
Connie and Clifford climb to the top of the knoll

CLIFFORD
I used to come up here as a lad
sit for hours One of the finest
views in all the Midlands

They come over the crest of the knoll and stop A wide swath
of land ahead has been completely cleared of trees

CONNIE
- What happened to all the trees

CLIFFORD
(He snorts in disbelief)
Looks as though father had them cut
down to build trenches - another
sacrifice for the war effort

CONNIE
I’m sorry Clifford

She squeezes his shoulder He glances up at her She looks
tired features drawn and pale Beat He comes to a decision

CLIFFORD

I want to restore these woods If
places like this aren’t preserved
there’1ll be no England left at all
Our way of life will end never
mind all we gave up to defend it

(Pause )
I mind not being able to have a son
here more than any other place

Connie looks over at Clifford realizing that the
conversation has taken a serious turn

CONNIE
I’m sorry we can’t have one

A pause Clifford looks at her

CLIFFORD
It would almost be a good thing if
you had a son by another man

Connie laughs then stops herself

CONNIE
You’re not serious

CLIFFORD
Well Why not

CONNIE
Why not Because we’re married - I
married you Clifford Why would
you even suggest such a thing

CLIFFORD
You told me how much you would love
a child This way you could have
one To dote on to fill your days
As far as anyone else knows I
might still be capable of fathering
a child If we brought him up at
Wragby he would be ours

CONNIE
(Amazed )
What about the other man

CLIFFORD
You had that lover in Germany -
what does it matter now Nothing
CONNIE
That was before we were married

CLIFFORD
And if it happens again life will
go on Why should it matter if you
sleep with another man once or
twice so long as we don’t lose one
another

CONNIE
Do you really mean that

CLIFFORD

Well of course I wouldn’t want you
to yield yourself completely to
him but the mechanical act of sex
is nothing compared to a life lived
together As long as you govern
your emotions accordingly we ought
to be able to arrange this thing as
easily as a trip to the dentist

CONNIE
(Eyes wide amazed )
A trip to And wouldn’t you
mind what man’s child I had

CLIFFORD
Oh no - I trust your judgement
You wouldn’t let the wrong sort of
man touch you It would have to be
someone with the utmost discretion
The Chatterley name depends on it

(Beat )

What do you think

A pause The conversation has quite overwhelmed Connie

CONNIE
Would you expect me to tell you who
the man was

CLIFFORD
(Beat shakes his head)
It’s better I don’t know

CONNIE
An heir means that much to you

CLIFFORD
It means a lot to the people here
I know you can do it for them And
for the Chatterleys

(MORE )

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
(He grips her hand)
You and I vowed to one another that
wed always be together If the
lack of a child threatens those
vows we should have a child You
do agree with me don’t you

Long pause Connie is stunned
EXT WRAGBY THE FIELDS - DAY

Connie walks alongside Clifford as they head back to the
house lost in thought Finally

CONNIE
I’m going ahead I have to get
ready for our guests this evening

CLIFFORD
Okay

She walks ahead of Clifford clearly shaken by his proposal -
the shock and wonder on her face gradually giving way to
resolve

INT WRAGBY ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

Another social gathering of Cliffords friends Connie sips
wine half-listening to one of Clifford’s excruciatingly dull
bachelor friends as Clifford speaks with Michaelis

MICHAELIS
They’re all talking about your book
in London It’s good work

CLIFFORD
You think so I wanted to write
something special Not just popular
- really first class

Connie excuses herself from her conversation crossing the
room taking in the features of the men she passes - enjoying
the license Cliffords proposal has given her She notices
Clifford’s BACHELOR FRIENDS engaged in ‘intellectual debate’
None of these pompous men are attractive to Connie at all

Michaelis appears beside her He nods toward Cliffords
friends and leans in speaking quietly

MICHAELIS
Do you imagine they’ve solved the
world’s problems yet

CONNIE
(She smiles )
I’m sure they think they have

MICHAELIS
It’s a shame they’ll have forgotten
their solutions by daybreak

CONNIE
You’re a writer Maybe you could go
take notes for them

MICHAELIS
I doubt I’d be welcome in that
drinking circle even as secretary

CONNIE
(A beat understanding)
It isn’t my world either really

MICHAELIS
But you grew up in it didn’t you

CONNIE
Hardly My father’s an artist I
grew up in rented villas and woke
each morning to the smell of
turpentine

MICHAELIS
Sounds like quite the Bohemian
lifestyle There must be days you
don’t feel like a Lady at all

Michaelis gestures casually as he speaks his fingertips
brushing Connie’s wrist as though by accident Connie
notices but doesn’t react She glances over toward Clifford
sees he is watching intently from across the room aware of
how closely she and Michaelis are standing together

MICHAELIS (CONTD)
I head home in the morning With
luck hell invite me to visit you
again

He tips his drink then moves off into the party Connie
watches him go

INT WRAGBY DINING ROOM - DAY

Breakfast Clifford watches Connie closely as she sips her
tea and gazes out the window lost in thought

CLIFFORD
I think it’s the last time we’1l be
inviting that young playwright

CONNIE
Michaelis Why

CLIFFORD
He writes well and knows how to
dress but he has the manners of a
Dublin street rat

CONNIE
- Maybe it’s because he knows
he’s only around as long as people
deem him useful

CLIFFORD
We all know where we stand
(Pause He spreads jam on
his toast)
You ought to eat something at
least You’re wasting away

CONNIE
I’m not feeling well To be honest
I haven’t been feeling well since
our conversation -

Lily arrives with newspapers Clifford takes one barely
listening to Connie as he flips quickly through the pages

CONNIE (CONTD)
(Trying for his
attention )
Clifford

CLIFFORD
Here we are They have a photograph
of me - look at that Lily
(Reading )
“Chatterley’s novella has garnered
attention for its humorous analysis
of people and their motives though
his views on modern society are
(His tone changing )
Not young and playful but curiously
old and obscenely conceited”

CONNIE
Clifford Stop reading

CLIFFORD
“A wonderful display of
nothingness

He slams the paper down Lily stands frozen in the doorway
Connie gestures for her to leave then turns to Clifford

CONNIE
(Quietly )
It’s just one review -

CLIFFORD
But they’re right - don’t you see
They saw right through it It’s all
nothing home love sex marriage
friendship - all of it

CONNIE
(Astonished )
You don’t mean that

CLIFFORD
Yes I do - the whole point of
living is learning to accept the
great nothingness of life

CONNIE
(Suddenly standing )
I’m going to get dressed

Connie walks away from the table and heads out of the room
leaving Clifford bewildered

INT CONNIES CHAMBERS - DAY

Connie glares at all the Chatterley family photos that line
the wall of her chambers She pulls them all down piling
them onto a chair the photograph of Lady Chatterley landing
hard enough for the glass in the picture frame to crack

EXT WRAGBY FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY
A sporty car screeches to a stop outside
INT WRAGBY ENTRANCE HALLSTAIRS

Hilda walks briskly into the house past Mrs Warren and up
the stairs towards Connie’s bedroom

INT CONNIE’S CHAMBERSHALL - DAY

Hilda taps on Connie’s door No answer She opens the door

HILDA
Connie It’s me

Inside Connie lays on her bed curtains drawn She has piled
the chair and the floor beside it with atomizers brushes
needlepoint - all remnants of the room’s former inhabitants

CONNIE
(Sitting up)
Hilda You came

HILDA
What on earth are you doing What
is all this

CONNIE
Nothing I wanted a change is all

Hilda steps close Connie looks gaunt with deep circles
under her eyes Hilda feels Connie’s forehead

HILDA
Youre ill

CONNIE
I’m fine

HILDA

Has no one been looking after you
Connie gestures to the pile of family pictures on the chair

CONNIE
They have I’m so tired of them
watching me - they’re inescapable
(Breaking down)
I’m so tired

INT CLIFFORD’S STUDY - DAY

Clifford is at his desk glowering at the stack of newspapers
in front of him Hilda knocks enters He doesn’t look up

HILDA
Connie’s not well Clifford

CLIFFORD
You think

HILDA
She’s exhausted Look at how thin
she’s gotten I’m afraid it doesn’t
suit her to be a half-virgin

Clifford recoils deeply offended

CLIFFORD
This chair doesn’t much suit me
either What do you propose we do
Find her another one of your German
soldiers

HILDA
She needs to see a doctor Do you
have one you use around here

CLIFFORD
I’1l1 look into it

HILDA
No I’ll take her to a doctor we
trust In the meantime you must
hire someone who can take care of
you personally from now on

CLIFFORD
I’m doing perfectly well thank
you

HILDA

I’m not worried about you
Clifford Who do you think’s taking
care of her while she’s taking care
of you

CLIFFORD
Connie and I will discuss it

HILDA

Connie and I already have

(Handing him a paper)
I believe you know this woman - a
Mrs Bolton She cared for you when
you were young

(Clifford sulks)
Connie will not be your caregiver
any longer

Clifford glares at Hilda barely able to contain his anger
INT WRAGBY ENTRANCE HALLCLIFFORD’S STUDY - DAY
Hilda and Connie walk through the entry hall with MRS BOLTON

(50s) - attractive outgoing carries herself in an assured
way

CONNIE
We’re so grateful that you could
come Really

MRS BOLTON
It must be hard for Sir Clifford
all he’s suffered And hard on you
as well You think you know how
life will be then suddenly it’s
gone I only had my Ted three years
before he was killed in the mines

CONNIE
I didn’t know I’m sorry

MRS BOLTON
Oh never you mind that - you just
follow doctor’s orders and leave
the care of Sir Clifford to me

Clifford appears having quietly wheeled his way into the
library doorway He has clearly been listening in

HILDA
Ah Clifford This is Mrs Bolton

Everyone looks up Clifford gazes critically at Mrs Bolton
who has lost her earlier confidence in his presence

CLIFFORD
Yes I remember Mrs Bolton Are we
all satisfied

HILDA
For the time being Now then I’m
headed back to London - and Connie
is going out for a nice long walk

CLIFFORD
Good Safe travels
(As they leave)
Connie would you stop by the
gamekeeper’s Ask if the new
pheasants have begun laying

CONNIE
Of course

Connie and Hilda leave Pause

MRS BOLTON
Is there anything you would like me
to do Sir Clifford

CLIFFORD
Not now Stop back in half an hour

EXT WRAGBY - HILL BY THE SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

Connie leaves the house walking towards the forest
EXT MELLOR’S COTTAGE - DAY

Connie comes down the path to Mellors’ gabled cottage

As she nears the cottage she finds Mellors standing outside
his back to her He washes himself at a basin naked to the
waist his breeches halfway down his hips

Connie slips out of view watching as Mellors ducks his head
in the basin then tosses his hair and squeezes it out

He grabs his shirt using a towel to dry himself as he walks
around to the front of the cottage A beat and then we hear
the cottage door close

Connie takes a moment to compose herself then follows
IE MELLOR’S COTTAGE - DAY

Connie crosses to Mellors’ door hesitates knocks After a
moment the door opens Mellors peers out surprised

MELLORS
Lady Chatterley Does Sir Clifford
need help

CONNIE
No He sent me Sorry - I didn’t
mean to intrude

Mellors nods smooths his damp hair his accent thickening as
he slips into the role of servant Out of politeness

MELLORS
Would yer like to come in

Connie nods Mellors slightly flustered moves aside Connie
enters aware of his discomfort

MELLORS (CONTD)
Sorry I’m not dressed for company
Nobody much comes here

CONNIE
Not to worry I only wanted - Sir
Clifford wanted to know if the new
pheasants had begun laying yet

MELLORS
Aye m’lady We’ll have plenty
young chicks in a matter of weeks

Connie nods hesitates not quite ready to leave

CONNIE
This is a lovely little cottage Do
you live alone here

MELLORS
Quite alone lady

Connie nods glances around the room - spartan but impeccably
clean She notices shelves filled with worn old books

CONNIE
You read James Joyce

MELLORS
That one was hard to find

CONNIE
Do you read much

Mellors shrugs almost smiles the broad accent fading

MELLORS
It suits my solitary nature

CONNIE
Still it must get awfully quiet
out here

Mellors tenses and clears his throat He gestures to his dog

MELLORS
I’ve got Flossie for company

CONNIE
(After a beat)
Well I’11 let Clifford know about
the pheasants Thank you

MELLORS
I’1l see you out then

Connie heads to the door reaching for the handle but he
gets there first Their hands brush - both draw back at once

MELLORS (CONTD)
Apologies

EXT MELLOR’S COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Mellors follows Connie silently to the cottage gate Connie
smiles noticing the wildflowers that surround them

CONNIE
Lovely flowers

MELLORS
Take some back with you

CONNIE
Oh no I couldn’t

MELLORS
Why not They’re yours

CONNIE
- Are you sure

MELLORS
Yea help yourself Good day then

Connie bends down to pick some wildflowers as Mellors ducks
back inside closing the door behind him

EXT MAREHAY FARM — DAY

Connie stands outside Mrs Flint’s home handing Mrs Flint a
bundle of wildflowers and watching as she puts them into a
watering can on an outdoor table Josephine plays in the
grass nearby

CONNIE
I brought you some flowers

MRS FLINT
Oh they’re beautiful Aren’t you
thoughtful

Connie takes one of the flowers and hands it to Josephine
who smiles delighted

CONNIE
They’re all growing in the fields
down by the gamekeeper’s cottage

(After a beat casually )

He’s an interesting fellow the
keeper He seems gruff at first
but then at times he talks almost
like a gentleman

Mrs Flint begins hanging a basket of freshly-washed laundry
on a nearby clothesline

MRS FLINT
The older teachers still talk about
how clever Oliver Mellors was as a
lad It’s no wonder he came back
home a full lieutenant

CONNIE
And now he lives down there alone

MRS FLINT
(Nods Sympathetically )
He was married but well his
wife Bertha the whole time he
was gone she carried on with other
men It was awful everyone knew

Connie and Mrs Flint walk over to a horse being cared for by
a FARRIER Mrs Flint strokes the mare - she nods giving
Connie permission to do the same

CONNIE
They’re divorced now

MRS FLINT

Not properly I don’t think - but
there never was much proper about
Bertha Coutts She’s off living
with another man at Stack’s Gate
Ned I think his name is I imagine
Mr Mellors would be happier never
hearing from either of them again

(Petting the horse)
This is Wendy

CONNIE
Hi Wendy She’s beautiful

INT CONNIE’S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Connie sits on the bed in her nightgown The dimly-lit room
now looks quite empty Connie rises closes the curtains
turns on a lamp and crosses to her dressing mirror gazing at
her tired features disapprovingly She pinches her cheeks
then pulls her hair back to smooth the lines out of her face

Beat Connie opens her nightgown slips it off her shoulders
and examines her naked figure swaying her hips standing on
tiptoe pulling her shoulders back to lift her breasts

She draws her gown back up leaving it open and letting her
fingertips graze gently over her breasts down to her abdomen

Beat Connie turns out the lamp and crosses back to bed

A vase of wildflowers sits by the window lit by moonlight
Stillness - then Connie can be seen in the background lying
in bed breathing heavily the sheets moving as she touches
herself She orgasms gasping then falls still

INT CONSERVATORY - DAY
Connie listens as Mrs Bolton pulls together a luncheon tray

MRS BOLTON

It was an explosion in the mines
Ted was only 28 The company said
it was his own fault somehow that
he was trying to run away when he
should have laid down so the
compensation was only 300 pounds

(Quietly bitter)
Ill never forgive them for that -
them branding Ted a coward

CONNIE
He wasn’t a coward he was only
trying to survive I’m so sorry

Mrs Bolton nods her appreciation lifts the luncheon tray

CONNIE (CONTD)
You really should let Lily deliver
Clifford’s lunch Mrs Bolton
You’re his nurse not his servant

MRS BOLTON

Oh I don’t mind Long as it gives
you more chance to recover

(A ring from the other

room )
Ah there’s the bell Lovely skies
outside you might take your walk
while you have the chance

IE THE BRIDGEWOODSTHE HUT - DAY

Connie comes out of the woods and walks across the bridge
bundled against the chill As she reaches the other side she
hears a faint tapping and notices a hidden track that leads
off through the trees

Connie follows the sound to a clearing where she discovers a
rustic hut Mellors crouches outside the hut nailing a
wooden cage together Flossie sees Connie and trots forward
with a sharp bark Mellors looks up startled

CONNIE
I wondered what the hammering was

Mellors tenses He turns his attention back to his work

MELLORS
Preppin’ coops for the new chicks

CONNIE
Ah Well

Connie crosses to the hut looking for a place to sit

CONNIE (CONTD)
Is there a chair in the hut

Mellors nods He rises without looking at Connie and crosses
to open the hut positioning a chair near the door in such a
way that he can continue his work out of view

He finally glances Connie’s way as she approaches his gruff
demeanor changing as he sees she’s shivering

MELLORS
I’1l light you a fire m’lady

CONNIE
Oh don’t bother

MELLORS
No I insist

Mellors leads Connie into the cramped space Bird cages are
stacked against the walls the floorboards are covered with
hay Mellors tosses some sticks into a little fireplace

MELLORS (CONTD)
Warm yourself up a little bit

Connie obeys Mellors walks back out and the hammering
returns Connie tries to peer out at him but the angle is
too great She deliberates moves to a stool near the door

Mellors glances up to find her gazing at him She doesn’t
look away He stiffens returning to work with effort

Beat Connie grows brazen and crosses to stand before
Mellors He gazes at her boots then rises eyes lowered in a
pointedly servile manner unintentionally stoking the erotic
tension Connie takes a slow breath speaks softly

CONNIE
I never knew this hut was here

MELLORS
Not many do That’s why I like it

CONNIE
Do you lock the hut when you’re not
around

MELLORS

Sometimes your Ladyship

CONNIE
Do you think I could have a key

MELLORS
(Glancing up tense )
Yer want a key

CONNIE
Yes I think I’d like to come sit
sometimes

MELLORS

Don’t know there is another key

CONNIE
We could have one made from yours

Mellors gazes directly at Connie frustrated

MELLORS
Don’t know nobody makes keys ‘round
here S’pose Sir Clifford might

CONNIE
(Growing impatient )
Fine then I’1l see to it myself

Mellors nods gives a broad salute and turns away going back
to work Connie’s eyes flash with heated indignation

CONNIE (CONTD)
Good afternoon then

Connie marches sullenly away from the hut brooding
INT CLIFFORD’S STUDY - DAY

Clifford is waiting when Connie arrives The tea kettle
simmers on the tray It bothers him that she is late it

bothers her that he is waiting Both pretend otherwise

CLIFFORD
Quite a walk you had

CONNIE
Am I late I’m sorry You could’ve
asked Mrs Bolton to make the tea
CLIFFORD
I don’t quite see her presiding at
the tea table

CONNIE
Why not I don’t recall anything
about tea in our wedding vows
(As she steeps the tea)
Is there a second key to that little
hut where the pheasants are reared

CLIFFORD
There may be one in the study Why

CONNIE
It’s a lovely place I could sit
there sometimes take my book along
to read couldn’t I

CLIFFORD
Are you still reading books by that
degenerate Irishman

CONNIE
James Joyce

CLIFFORD
You know his latest has been banned
for obscenity

CONNIE
Such a shame I’d been looking
forward to reading it

CLIFFORD
(After a pause)
Was Mellors at the hut

CONNIE
Yes He didn’t seem to like me
intruding at all

CLIFFORD
Really What did he say

Connie softens not wanting to get Mellors in trouble

CONNIE
Oh nothing just his manner I
don’t think he wanted me to quite
have the freedom of the castle

CLIFFORD

(Nods returning to tea)
That’s what comes of making
lieutenant then having to go back
to being gamekeeper

(He shakes his head)
What else do they expect - giving a
fellow like that rank and a sense
of importance then taking it all
away It seems cruel really

EXT MELLOR’S COTTAGE - DUSK
A spring shower darkens stone walkways and pelts wildflowers
INT WRAGBY CLIFFORD’S BEDROOMLIBRARY - NIGHT

Rain taps at the sitting room window Connie’s reflection
blurred in the glass panes

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
I hope it hasn’t been raining all
week in London It has here Until
now I had been able to go out and
explore the grounds all I liked

EXT HILL BY THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE - DAY

Connie runs down the hill in the rain shivering wet her
book tucked under her arm

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
But I’ve spent most of this last
week cooped up aching to get back
outside

IE THE HUT - DAY

Connie tries the door of the hut Locked She glances around
for any sign of Mellors noticing hens in the chicken coops

CUT TO

Connie sits on the porch writing the letter to Hilda on a
few pieces of stationery she has tucked into her book

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
I’m writing now from a little hut I
found a secret place where I can
hide away from the world Only one
other person comes here

Connie stops writing looks up The rain has abated No sign
of Mellors

She sighs closing the letter into the book just as Mellors
comes up the path He slows when he sees her She reads his
face rises

CONNIE (CONTD)
Don’t worry I was just going I
only came to get out of the rain

Mellors comes to a decision pulls out the key offers it

MELLORS
Here - I can tend the birds some
other place

CONNIE
(Frustrated )
I don’t want you to I only wanted
to be able to sit here sometimes

MELLORS
Your Ladyship is welcome to do
whatever she likes I only thought
you wouldn’t want me about when
youre here

CONNIE
Why should I mind you being here
Why should I take any notice of you
at all

MELLORS
(Suppressing a smile)
You shouldnt Not in the
slightest

He salutes her turns and opens the hut then sets the key on
the ledge of the small window by the door

MELLORS (CONTD)
Well keep it here until I get
another

A beat Connie walks inside The room has been straightened
In one corner there’s a small cage with a colorfully-plumed
pheasant inside it Connie peers into the cage

CONNIE
Look at you You must be Lord of
the manor all those poor drab hens
competing for your attention
(Over her shoulder )
How long until the chicks arrive

Connie looks back Mellors is gone

“WAITING FOR THE CHICKS TO HATCH” — MONTAGE
IN MONTAGE as days pass

key on the sill glancing along the path to Mellors’
cottage

- ANOTHER DAY Connie lays in the grass just outside
Wragby playing with the weeds restless She turns
looks to the sky

- CONNIE ENTERS WRAGBY Clifford is playing piquet with
Mrs Bolton in the library She slips through the
entrance hall and heads to her room unnoticed

— ANOTHER DAY As Connie enters the hut one of the hens
begins loudly clucking protectively

Connie gasps as she sees an empty egg shell She peers
through the cage door spying a little pheasant chick

END MONTAGE
INT HALLWAYTHE BATHROOM - DAY

Connie hurries excitedly down the hallway hearing Mrs
Bolton’s voice in the bathroom ahead

MRS BOLTON (0S)
- Her father the old man James
died last year from a fall eighty
three he was

Connie arrives at the door Mrs Bolton is filing Cliffords
nails He has one ear pressed to a headset and is adjusting
dials on a primitive radio in front of him Static crackles
out of an oversized speaker

CLIFFORD
Did you hear that

Clifford notices Connie barely looks up

CONNIE
The chicks have started hatching

CLIFFORD
Ah Good -

A SPANISH VOICE crackles briefly through static Clifford
gazes at the horn speaker in awe

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
You hear that I got Madrid

MRS BOLTON
What’s he saying

Clifford waves for silence The voice fades out

CLIFFORD
Lost the signal Damn Damn

Beat Clifford leans back in frustration Connie sighs and
leaves unnoticed Mrs Bolton goes back to Clifford’s nails

MRS BOLTON
Of course the young have mostly
left Tevershall They say now the
coal is running thin it won’t be
long before the town is finished

CLIFFORD
Finished They really say that
(He thinks a beat)
Call down to the mines See if Mr
Linley can join us for dinner

INT CONNIES CHAMBERS - DAY

Connie sits by the window watching in frustration as the
rain continues to fall She spots Mellors and Flossie walking
up the knoll in the distance

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
I wish I could be with you in
Venice but Clifford says he can’t
manage here without me Not yet at
least But I’1l come on the next
holiday I promise With love your
sister Connie

INT WRAGBY ENTRANCE HALL - EARLY EVENING

A servant refills wine for guests seated around a long table
The meal has ended but plates have not yet been cleared All
listen as Clifford holds court with LINLEY (40s) manager of
the Tevershall mines Connie sips wine utterly bored alone
amidst company

LINLEY
They built a chemical works at
Stacks Gate to increase profits
That should keep them in business
for the foreseeable future

Connie signals the servant for more wine but he doesn’t see
her and walks away leaving her with an empty glass

CLIFFORD
We can modernize as well Why not

CONNIE
What about your writing Clifford

CLIFFORD
The literary world doesn’t need me -
but the mine is a sinking ship It
needs a proper captain to save it

Connie rolls her eyes at Cliffords arrogance

CONNIE
Those workers couldn’t lead grimmer
lives - perhaps it’s best to help
them move on

CLIFFORD
To what begging “Help them move
on” — don’t talk like such a woman
CONNIE

(She flinches at this)
Spoken like a man

Clifford ignores this comment He turns to address Linley
CLIFFORD

How much would it cost us to build
a chemical works Mr Linley

LINLEY
Initially I would imagine five to
seven hundred pounds

The men continue talking Connie rises staring at Clifford a
long moment before leaving the room

INT WRAGBY ENTRANCE HALLSTUDYCONSERVATORY - DUSK

Connie passes through the entrance hall She ducks into the
study then goes outside through the conservatory doors

EXT WRAGBY SIDE ENTRANCE (CONSERVATORY DOORS) - DUSK

The party continues inside as Connie steals from the house
EXT THE HUT - DUSK

Connie hurries along the path to the hut panting slightly

She slows seeing Mellors crouched before the coops He
glances back then returns his attention to the coops

CONNIE
I came to see the chicks How many
now

MELLORS

Eighteen so far Not bad

Connie crouches looking in three chicks now peer out from
under the mother hen’s feathers

CONNIE
Can I touch one

MELLORS
Go on then They’re yours

CONNIE
What if it pecks at me

MELLORS
(Laughing )
Just peck it back

Connie opens the door to the coop uncertain She reaches
inside and the chicks all run from her she jumps back in
surprise

Mellors watches then reaches into the coop himself He
slowly draws out a chick runs a finger over the it’s back
grinning Connie gazes at him

MELLORS (CONTD)
Just like this

Connie reaches out hesitates Mellors takes her hand The
moment they touch Connie stops breathing Mellors turns her
hand over cupping the bird into her palm

MELLORS (CONTD)
That’s it Gently

CONNIE
He’s trembling I don’t think he
likes being in a cage

MELLORS
You’re trembling more than he is

Mellors smiles - then he sees a tear fall onto Connie’s
wrist He looks up her face is streaked with tears Mellors
rises and occupies himself with another coop pretending not
to notice Gathering himself he turns looks at Connie

She has her hands blindly stretched out toward the cage
Mellors kneels beside her placing the chick back inside

Connie looks away unable to hide her anguish Mellors’ heart
melts He closes the coop placing a hand on her knee Connie
lifts her hands to her face ashamed

MELLORS (CONTD)
There now

CONNIE
I am so sorry

Mellors sighs finally coming to understand her

MELLORS
That’s alright

Connie’s breath catches She leans forward burying her face
against his chest She presses her lips to the cloth of his
shirt

Mellors freezes caught off-guard and struggling against
desire Pause He takes Connie’s arms embracing her

MELLORS (CONTD)
That’s how it’s been eh Trapped
as we all are

INT THE HUT - DUSK

Mellors guides Connie to a chair helping her sit even as he
tries to distance himself

MELLORS
Let’s get you by the fire You’1l
want more firewood

CONNIE
No Don’t go Please

Connie grips the cloth of Mellors’ shirt She presses up
against his hand turning to kiss one of his knuckles He
sighs brushing his fingers along her cheek A beat Mellors
takes a blanket and spreads it before the fireplace

Connie lays on the floor as Mellors closes the door leaving
the room in darkness He sits beside Connie runs his fingers
through her hair He kisses her cheek then leans in to press
his lips against the nape of her neck moving with increasing
urgency

Connie quivers as Mellors lifts her dress and traces his
fingertips along her stomach wandering over the curve of her
ribs and down to the softness of her inner thighs His desire
mounting he slowly slips off Connie’s knickers drawing them
carefully down and over her feet

Mellors leans down brushing his lips against her navel
Connie grasps his head trembling then lets go - trying to
keep from being carried away by the intensity of the moment

Mellors lifts Connie and brings his hips to hers - her breath
catches as he enters her Connie arches back as he slowly

moves inside her - then she feels herself being carried away
again and forces herself to become aware of her surroundings

She looks at the cages lining the walls at the piles of
wood at the pheasant in the corner Anywhere but at Mellors

Mellors arms tighten around Connie as his thrusts intensify
Her fingers clasp the edge of the blanket Unable to hold
himself back Mellors finally cries out and collapses softly
planting a few final loose kisses on her exposed breast

Connie glances down at Mellors’ head his features hidden He
still holds her tight but his breathing has grown quiet She
slowly lets go of the blanket afraid to disturb the moment

Mellors sits up reaches out to pull Connie’s dress down over
her knees then rises He buttons his pants quietly opens
the door and goes out

EXT THE HUT - DUSK

Connie steps onto the porch Mellors approaches out of the
shadows

MELLORS
I’11 walk you back

He steps past her to lock the hut hesitating a moment before
placing the key on the ledge Connie walks out ahead along
the path He hurries to catch up After a pause

MELLORS (CONTD)
Are you alright m’lady

CONNIE
(A beat Connie smiles
enjoying the feeling)
I am yes Are you

MELLORS
(He nods)
Aye

They walk on in silence to the edge of the woods Connie
grows anxious

CONNIE
I should go on alone
(She searches his eyes)
Goodbye then

MELLORS
Goodbye my lady

Connie turns away walking onward alone

EXT WRAGBY CONSERVATORY DOOR - DUSK

ring the bell After a moment Mrs Bolton opens the door

MRS BOLTON

worried you’d gone lost

CONNIE
(A little too sharp )
No I’m absolutely fine Why did
you lock the door I just went to
see the new chicks

Bolton follows Connie through the house

MRS BOLTON
I’m sorry my lady

CONNIE
(Relenting )
Is Clifford upset I left without
saying good night to the guests

MRS BOLTON
He hasn’t said anything He’s still
in with Mr Linley

They arrive outside Cliffords study Clifford and Linley are
poring over manuals Clifford glances up nods to Connie
returns to work Connie pulls the door shut relieved

CONNIE

(Realizing )
Youre afraid

For the first time Mellors looks straight into her eyes

MELLORS
I am I bloody well am yeah Not
for what people think of me But if
ever you were to feel sorry for
what we done -

Connie silences him with a kiss - their first Mellors looks
into her eyes kisses her again then rises and guides her
into the hut

CONNIE
We have to be quick

INT THE HUT - CONTINUOUS

They go inside Mellors lays blankets on the floor goes to
stoke the fire Connie sees the curtains are open hurries to
draw them She takes off her coat setting it aside

CONNIE
I can’t stay long Clifford doesn’t
notice when I’m late anymore but
Mrs Bolton will

Mellors steps close holding her near with one hand slipping
his other under her skirts He moans as his fingers find her
Her eyes close she exhales

MELLORS
Look at me

Connie’s body reacts even as her mind subtly resists

Mellors kneels lifts her skirts removes her knickers He
brushes his lips across her thighs closer his thick hair
grazing her hip bone

He presses his lips into her clutching her thighs Connie
shudders - aroused but afraid to yield too much of herself
Mellor’s passion is urgent intense - she clenches and
unclenches her fist repeatedly then grips his shoulder

CONNIE
Wait - wait -

Mellors lifts his head She exhales in relief
Tears fill Connie’s eyes She turns her head away

CONNIE (CONTD)
It’s late I have to go

Connie walks out suddenly leaving Mellors to watch after
her

EXT NEAR THE GATE - DUSK

Near dark Connie walks ahead as Mellors hurries to catch up
Connie hesitates near the gate turns around

CONNIE
It feels like we’re still
strangers doesn’t it

MELLORS
Not like strangers I’ve ever known

Mellors pulls Connie close gazing into her eyes She gasps
caught off-guard by the flame that rises within her
frightened by the intensity of her feelings Her hand shoots
out to grip the gate for balance

CONNIE
Wait - stop

He lets her go Connie starts through the gate then turns
back kissing him with passionate intensity Mellors embraces
her gently as they kiss urging Connie toward quiet Finally

MELLORS
Why don’t you come to the cottage
tomorrow

Connie nods and turns hurrying off into the night

CONNIE
If I can Good night Oliver

MELLORS
Good night then your ladyship

Connie glances back into the darkness Mellors is gone A
beat and then she heads home

INT WRAGBY DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Connie sits at dinner half-pretending to listen to Clifford
lost in her own thoughts The words flow past her

CLIFFORD
The Germans have invented an engine
that requires a new kind of fuel
If we can produce that fuel here

Connie notices a bit of hay clinging to her sleeve She
quickly plucks it off looks back up to see Clifford staring

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
Are you all right You aren’t
feeling unwell again are you

CONNIE
No - not at all

CLIFFORD
I know the mine seems to be all I
talk about anymore But Tevershall
belongs to me - and one day it will
belong to an heir
(Glancing over)
That is still the case yes

CONNIE
I yes One day

CLIFFORD
Well then the mine needs my help -
which means we need to modernize

Connie nods Cliffords voice fades as her mind wanders

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
My dear sister I’ve thought a lot
about what you said at the wedding -
that I open my heart too easily
That may have been true before the
war but I don’t think it is any
longer

INT THE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Connie lies in the tub and stares at the ceiling running a
hand idly over her body as she tries to process her feelings

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
Lately I have felt my heart
opening up again despite all
warnings

Enough She finds the washcloth and soap and begins fervently
scrubbing Mellors’ scent from her skin

EXT WRAGBY HILL BY THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE - DAY

Connie comes out of Wragby She pauses anxious then starts
walking quickly across the park toward the gate

CONNIE (LETTER VO)
And I can assure you nothing about
it has been easy

Mrs Bolton comes out of Wragby holding Connie’s book She
walks out across the park sees Connie headed to the gate

MRS BOLTON
Lady Chatterley Your book

Connie stops then abruptly turns heading in another
direction altogether - refusing to look back at Mrs Bolton

CONNIE
That’s alright Mrs Bolton Thank
you

Mrs Bolton squints after Connie in wonder then looks out in
the direction Connie had been heading

EXT MAREHAY FARM — DAY

The late afternoon sun hangs low Connie and Mrs Flint sit
at the table outside the farmhouse sipping lemonade

Connie bounces Josephine gently on her knee

CONNIE
“This is the way the farmers ride -
jogglety jogglety jog”
(Hugging the girl)
Aren’t you perfect

MRS FLINT
Don’t let her fool you That one’s
given us a lot of sleepless nights

CONNIE
All of them worth it I’m sure

MRS FLINT
(She smiles)
Were so happy you came by to visit
us today - aren’t we Josephine

CONNIE
You know Clifford and I have
talked about having a child
ourselves one day

MRS FLINT
Have you

Mrs Flint does her best to hide her surprise Connie smiles

CONNIE
Yes Just because he’s lost the use
of his legs doesn’t mean he can’t
have children

MRS FLINT
Oh well - that’s wonderful isn’t
it Josephine would love to have a
new playmate And being a mother
I recommend it by all means
(Confidentially )
I lied to you She is perfect

Connie smiles then something catches her eye She turns
surprised to discover Mellors coming out of the woods towards
them Mellors sees Connie and slows saluting

CONNIE
What’s the gamekeeper doing here

MRS FLINT
He comes each day for fresh milk
If you’d watch Josephine a moment -
(As Mellors approaches )
Good day Mr Mellors

MELLORS
Mrs Flint Lady Chatterley

Mrs Flint crosses to a shed as Mellors comes to the table
Connie shakes her head occupying herself with Josephine

MELLORS (CONTD)
You said youd come to the cottage

CONNIE
I said Id try

MELLORS
Will you come later

Mellors reaches out to her Connie jerks away leaving him
stunned Mrs Flint reappears with a milk jug handing it off
to Mellors He nods his thanks as Connie stands to leave

MELLORS (CONTD)
Shall I walk you back your
Ladyship

CONNIE
That isn’t necessary Thank you
Good day Mrs Flint

MRS FLINT
Do come again

EXT THE WOODS BY THE CLEARING - DAY

Connie walks a twisting path through the woods the ground
rutted and stony the trees dense She rounds a stand of fir
trees and stops groaning Mellors stands before her

MELLORS
Giving me the slip like

CONNIE
No - what do you mean

MELLORS
You didn’t come to the cottage
today and then you pulled away
from me back there -

CONNIE
Mrs Flint could have seen Are you
mad

Mellors steps close putting an arm around her

MELLORS
Come to the cottage then

CONNIE
No By the time we got there it
would be too late
Mellors looks through the dense fir trees

MELLORS
Then come with me through here

EXT THE CLEARING - DAY - CONTINUOUS
They enter a small rough clearing branches pulling at
Connie’s hair and clothing Mellors arranges a few boughs on

the ground stripping off his coat and laying it over them

CONNIE
What here In the woods
MELLORS
Aye my lady Right here

CONNIE
Don’t call me that

Mellors steps close He runs his hand down her cheek

MELLORS
You don’t want to be a lady

CONNIE
- No Not with you

His hands move down to caress her sides her breasts

MELLORS
You want courser treatment with me

Connie’s breath catches She nods He tugs at

MELLORS (CONTD)
Give me this

Connie takes it off Mellors tosses it on the
and tugs a button on her blouse gripping her

MELLORS (CONTD)
Take this off

She does deliberately slowly watching him
patience - he pulls open her blouse and tears

her coat

bed of branches
by the waist

Mellors loses
open the

camisole beneath it cupping her breast in his hand Connie
gasps Her breathing slows She lowers her eyes

MELLORS (CONTD)
Look at me

Connie raises her eyes to him Mellors takes her wrist

moving her hand down against his trousers

MELLORS (CONTD)
Open my belt Undo the buttons

Connie obeys trying to control the shudder in her breath

MELLORS (CONTD)
Now lie down over there

Connie lays on the coats half-turned away Mellors slides
out of his trousers and unbuttons his shirt watching her

MELLORS (CONTD)
No Turn around Look at me

Connie turns and leans back onto her elbows eyes burning
into Mellors He kneels running his fingernails up her calf

MELLORS (CONTD)
Lift your skirts

Connie lifts her skirts up above her knees Mellors runs his
hands slowly up Connie’s legs exploring every curve of her
thighs finally sliding his fingers inside her Connie moans

Mellors rips at her waistband tearing off her skirts and
knickers He pins her back against the coats and branches
spreading her legs

CONNIE
I want you to fuck me

MELLORS
You want me to fuck you

CONNIE
Yes

He slips inside her They look into each other’s eyes
overcome Mellors’ hand goes to Connie’s cheek

Connie nods As he moves inside her Connie feels herself
slipping away - no hiding this time no escape

She clamors for him clutching his waist pulling him deeper
She claws at his back and buttocks crying out eyes wide as
for the first time she allows herself to let go completely

MELLORS
Yes Yes that’s it Stay with me
Connie

Mellors grips Connie as she climaxes Her ecstasy sends him
over the top he tenses shuddering as he releases into her

They fall still Connie’s grip on Mellors slowly relaxes

EXT THE CLEARING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Connie sits on the boughs staring off in quiet wonder hair

tousled face relaxed At peace She watches moved as

Mellors caresses her palm in silence absorbed by her beauty
CONNIE

I’ve never felt like that before
I’ve never come off like that
MELLORS
We came off together Some folks
live their lives through and never
know that feeling

CONNIE
Have you with other women

MELLORS
You’re not other women

CONNIE
How am I not like other women

MELLORS
Well you got the nicest ass of
any woman I’ve ever seen

Connie laughs Mellors smiles caressing her

MELLORS (CONTD)
It’s true You’re beautiful
(A beat)
Other women the moment sex is done
it’s done The fire goes cold Not
with you - it never goes out
There’s something alive between us

EXT GATE TO THE PARK - DAY
Mellors and Connie arrive back at the main path

CONNIE
Do you know what you have that
other men don’t Tenderness
(Off his amused reaction )
Not gentleness - I’ve had enough of
gentlemen

MELLORS
They’re a different breed

CONNIE
How do you mean

MELLORS
Dead Dead when it comes to matters
of the heart You’ve got to kill
off those parts of you that feel if
you want to send men into mines
chimneys factories or battle
that or live with what you done

Connie takes this in smiles After a beat

CONNIE
Youre not like any other man I’ve
met before

MELLORS
Youre not like any other woman

Mellors falls silent Connie kisses him strokes his chest

CONNIE
I don’t think I realized until now
how lonely I’ve been Thank you

MELLORS
Id better not come with you any
further Tomorrow then

Connie nods She watches him wistfully as he goes then walks
toward Wragby floating along the path She stops a hand
coming to rest on her belly A smile plays at the corners of
her lips

IE THE GROUNDS OF WRAGBY (MONTAGE) - DAYEVENING

- TALL FIELD GRASS sways along a path Connie comes into view
as she climbs astride Mellors holding his wrists as she
presses him back onto the ground He lifts her skirts she
wears nothing underneath

- Connie and Mellors cling to one another in THE MOSS
intertwined

- They lie before the fire in the COTTAGE sipping beer as
they read to one another enjoying each other’s company

- They make love beneath an ancient tree half-clothed

- Mellors and Connie swim in a STREAM BY THE HUT their
clothes soaked through Mellors reaches out to Connie
beckoning her further in

END MONTAGE
INT THE CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

Connie sits in the Winter Garden conservatory in her
nightgown gazing out through the windows Mrs Bolton passes
by the door startled to see Connie is still awake

MRS BOLTON
Your Ladyship I’m sorry to disturb
you I saw the light and -
CONNIE
Sit - I’d be glad for the company
What are you doing up so late

MRS BOLTON
Sir Clifford hasn’t been sleeping
I can’t help looking in on him It
was the same with my husband - if
he so much as caught a cold I’d be
awake all night worrying over him

CONNIE
Ted You must miss him

MRS BOLTON
It’s been twenty-five years and
still sometimes Especially at
night I wake up thinking “he’s not
in bed with me”

CONNIE
The touch of him

MRS BOLTON
(Turning surprised )
Aye The touch of him

CONNIE
There was a boy when I was young
He died in the war But the memory
of him so many years later It’s
amazing isn’t it How someone can
get so into your blood

MRS BOLTON
It is Makes you feel bitter If it
hadn’t been for that pit Ted would
still be here He hated it down
there just hated it But what else
could he do He was trapped

Connie nods understanding She remembers Mellors’ words

Mrs

CONNIE
I suppose we all are in different
ways

CONNIE (CONTD)
You never wanted to remarry
(Mrs Bolton laughs
shaking her head)
Ted was the only one

Bolton takes this in She nods with newfound respect

MRS BOLTON

He was Always You and your man -
you grow together What else is
there in this life Children of
course but -

(Realizing )
I am sorry That was thoughtless of
me bringing children into it

CONNIE
No don’t worry It’s fine
(After a beat)
More than fine actually There
still might be some hope in that
regard

MRS BOLTON
For you - And Sir Clifford

CONNIE
(She nods Confidential )
The doctor says Cliffords recovery
has been remarkable So who knows
I might have a child yet

Mrs Bolton is flabbergasted This has to be untrue yet

MRS BOLTON
Well I hope and pray you do

Mrs Bolton rises preparing to return to her work

MRS BOLTON (CONTD)
May I get you a blanket

CONNIE
Oh no - thank you Sleep well
Let’s save a few secrets for our
next conversation shall we

MRS BOLTON
I would like that my lady Good
night
Mrs Bolton goes leaving Connie alone in the conservatory
INT MELLOR’S COTTAGE - NIGHT
Mellors slumps at his dining table unable to sleep He looks

around the room then rises heading toward the door and
calling to Flossie

MELLORS
Come on then We’re best off
outside

EXT THE PATH TO WRAGBYWRAGBY - DAWN

Mellors walks through the dark exhausted coughing He
stares across at Wragby Against his better judgement he
opens the gate and heads toward the manor

The first light of morning creeps over the rise as Mellors
reaches the house He stares up at windows on the second
floor searching for any sign of Connie

INT CLIFFORD’S BEDROOMLIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Clifford sleeps restlessly Mrs Bolton dozes in a chair She
awakens hearing Clifford toss Mrs Bolton rises crosses to
the bed adjusts his pillow then starts to go back to her
chair when she hears a dog bark

Mrs Bolton stops at the window and cautiously parts the
curtains peering out She catches a glimpse of Mellors just
as he gives up on finding Connie’s room and turns to go

The gamekeeper But what is he -

Bolton’s jaw drops She steps back amazed

INT DINING ROOM - DAY

Breakfast Clifford sits alone sipping tea and reading the
newspaper Mrs Bolton enters brimming with secrets

MRS BOLTON
Is her Ladyship not risen yet

CLIFFORD
She got up before I did

MRS BOLTON
She’s already had breakfast then

CLIFFORD
Yes She’s off on one of her walks

MRS BOLTON
I was up early myself A lot of
people about this morning

Clifford turns a page of the paper raises it slightly more
interested in reading than talking Mrs Bolton hesitates

MRS BOLTON (CONTD)
The gamekeeper was up early -

CLIFFORD
Get me some fresh cream would you

MRS BOLTON
Yes sir

INT TEVERSHALL LAUNDRY - DAY

Tevershall women do wash in a communal laundry washing soot
from the mines out of their husband’s clothes Mrs Bolton’s
friends MRS BETTS MRS WHEEDON and MRS THOMPSON (all 50s)
gossip as they do their wash together Mrs Bolton folds her
clothes nearby though her mind is elsewhere

MRS BETTS
Ever since Sir Clifford took over
they’ve been working those poor
miners to the bone

MRS WHEEDON
I thought the machines were
supposed to make the work easier

MRS BETTS
No They’re just a way to make more
money with fewer workers

MRS THOMPSON
Don’t he have enough money already

MRS BETTS
Oh but his Lady needs her baubles
and silks so she can lord her
station over the rest of us -

MRS BOLTON
No - she’s not like that

The other women turn to Mrs Bolton surprised

MRS BOLTON (CONTD)
She treats folks who work for her
with the same respect she treats a
Lord or Lady

MRS WHEEDON
My Lily says the same about her

MRS BETTS
(Nods considering )
She deserves better then Such a
hard lot that’s fallen to her

MRS BOLTON

Well as it happens it seems
Sir Clifford isn’t quite as done in
as we thought His legs won’t work
again but the rest might

(She leans in quietly )

Her Ladyship even suggested there
might be a child one day soon

MRS BETTS
What No That’s amazing

MRS THOMPSON
Have you ever heard of such a thing

The news reverberates around the room - it is clear that the
other women in the laundry have been eavesdropping

INT CLIFFORD’S STUDY - DAY
Clifford goes over the mining development plans with Linley

CLIFFORD
And how long will they last

LINLEY
If we keep them in good repair
they ought to last for generations
to come Speaking of which sir
if you don’t mind me asking - is
there any truth to the rumor that
we may still have hope for an heir
to Wragby

CLIFFORD
(Blinking )
Are there rumors

LINLEY
Yes - everyone’s been asking me
what I know about it Of course
Ill be happy to set the record
straight if the rumor’s unfounded

CLIFFORD
(His eyes brightening )
Indeed Well there might yet be
hope

INT WRAGBY CLIFFORD’S BEDROOMLIBRARY - DAY

Clifford sits with his newspapers distracted Connie
arranges tulips in a vase half-turned away from him

CLIFFORD
Connie - did you know that there’s
a rumor you’re going to supply
Wragby with an heir

A flicker of fear in Connie’s eyes she focuses on the tulips

CONNIE
No Is it a joke

CLIFFORD
Id hoped it might be a prophecy

Connie hears this crosses to place flowers in the window

CONNIE
I received a letter from father He
accepted an invitation to stay in
Venice for July and August and he’s
asked Hilda and me to join him

CLIFFORD
July and August

CONNIE
I wouldn’t need to be gone that
long
(Turning pointedly )
Three weeks ought to be more than
enough time for what we discussed

CLIFFORD
(His insecurities flare)
Have Have plans already been
set in motion

CONNIE
Not just yet no

CLIFFORD
Well If I were absolutely
certain you’d want to come back

CONNIE
Of course I would

CLIFFORD
I don’t want to know his name No
one can

Connie nods in agreement

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
(Smiling almost joyful)
In that case I think it would be
all right don’t you

INT MELLORS COTTAGE - DAY

Mellors pours Connie a cup of tea She fiddles with the mug
silent After a moment

CONNIE
You know how much you mean to me
don’t you

MELLORS
And you to me

CONNIE
-- Because I have to go away for
awhile To Venice

MELLORS
With Sir Clifford For how long

CONNIE
Just a couple of months But not
with Clifford no He doesn’t like
to travel how he is

MELLORS
Aye The poor devil

Mellors finishes pouring his own tea then hangs up the
kettle coming over to sit with Connie

CONNIE
You won’t forget about me

MELLORS
You know I won’t forget It’s nota
question of memory

Connie smirks then braces herself for the conversation
ahead

CONNIE
I told Clifford I might have a
child

MELLORS

You did
CONNIE
I think I may already be expecting

Silence Mellors shakes his head in disbelief

CONNIE (CONTD)
Mellors

MELLORS
What did he say

CONNIE
He said he’d be glad to have one
So long as it seemed to be his

MELLORS
(Beat )
So where does sir Clifford suppose
this child is coming from

CONNIE
I implied I might have an affair in
Venice

MELLORS
You might So that’s why you’re
going

CONNIE

No - not to have the affair Just
the appearance of one

Mellors takes this in shakes his head

MELLORS
So that’s why you wanted me then
To get a child

CONNIE
Of course not Oliver I never
planned on you I never planned on -

MELLORS
So what was the plan Connie What
was the plan then really

CONNIE
There was no - I don’t know

MELLORS
You don’t know Is that supposed to
make me feel better

CONNIE
I don’t know

MELLORS

Well damned if I do Fucking hell

(Lashing out)
Well it’s as your ladyship likes
If you get a child Sir Cliffords
welcome to it I shan’t have lost
anything On the contrary - I’ve
had a nice experience

CONNIE
Don’t talk like that

MELLORS

And if you’ve made use of me it’s
not the first time I’ve been made
use of is it And I don’t suppose
it’s ever been as pleasant as this
time

(Beat he sulks)
Of course one can’t feel
tremendously dignified by it

Connie starts toward the door then hesitates She looks
back hoping Mellors is going to stop her

CONNIE
I didn’t make use of you Oliver

MELLORS
As your ladyship pleases

A beat Connie leaves hurt fighting tears
MELLORS (CONTD)
You want to take your book along
Or have you finished with it too
Mellors tosses the book onto a side table heads upstairs
The book slides off landing sideways its cover opened
revealing the nameplate inside “Constance Reid”

EXT THE FIELDS OF WRAGBY - DAY

Clifford drives out across the open fields in his new
motorized wheelchair Connie close behind

CLIFFORD
Sir Clifford on his foaming steed

A SHORT TIME LATER - Clifford talks as he motors alongside
Connie through a field of flowers

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
With the new generators we can
reduce our work force - striking
will be as good as impossible

CONNIE
What about the workers

CLIFFORD
No man is forced to work for me
And I’m not forced to hire them

CONNIE
(Disgusted )
No wonder those men hate you

CLIFFORD
They don’t hate me They depend on
me They should be grateful if
anything - they would starve
without someone to tend them

CONNIE
Clifford You talk as though
they’re herd animals

CLIFFORD
Not all of them An individual may
rise from the pack now and again
but most of those men have been
ruled since time began

CONNIE
And you can rule them

CLIFFORD
(Simply )
Yes I was brought up and trained
to do so That is my role in
society it’s their place to serve

CONNIE
So is there no common humanity
between us

CLIFFORD
We all need to eat and breathe
Beyond that no

Clifford has had his say He starts up his chair

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
Shall we go as far as the spring

Clifford rides off Connie sighs watching as the chair bumps
over the hyacinths crushing them under its wheels then
follows him

Clifford notices Mellors crossing through the field off to
one side of the path

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
Good day to you Mr Mellors

Mellors tips his hat as Clifford passes

Connie sees Mellors and starts toward him Mellors shakes his
head Connie stops quietly mouths “I’m sorry” Mellors gives
a curt nod gestures for Connie to catch up to Clifford

Up ahead the wheels of Clifford’s chair get tangled in weeds
and slip in mud The engine struggles Connie hurries ahead

CONNIE
Wait Clifford - I’1l push

CLIFFORD
What’s the use of the damned thing
if it has to be pushed

Connie grabs on from behind the chair pushing it forward as
Clifford struggles with the engine

CONNIE
Clifford you’re making it worse

CLIFFORD
Be quiet a moment would you

The engine dies Clifford tries to restart it It falters
fails Furious Clifford honks his horn glancing back at
Mellors who is already on his way to help

CLIFFORD (CONTD)

Mellors
MELLORS

Yes Sir Clifford
CLIFFORD

You know anything about motors
MELLORS

Afraid not sir Has she gone wrong
CLIFFORD

(Biting )

Apparently
(MORE )

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
Just have a look and see that
nothing’s broken will you

Mellors lies on the ground pokes around the engine Connie
glares at Clifford angered by his treatment of Mellors

MELLORS
Seems alright as far as I can see

CLIFFORD
Stand back then

Mellors rises Clifford manages to start the engine puts it
in gear The chair lurches and moves weakly forward

MELLORS
If I give it a push -

CLIFFORD
Keep off It’1ll work on its own

The chair slips sideways Mellors stops the chair from
sinking further into the mud

CLIFFORD (CONTD)

You see
(Then he realizes )
Are you pushing I asked you not

MELLORS
It won’t go otherwise

CLIFFORD
Give it a chance

CONNIE
Clifford watch your brake

Mellors lets go As soon as he does the motor dies and the
chair rolls backward Connie and Mellors grab it The chair
stops wheels buried THUNDER rumbles in the distance

CLIFFORD
It’s obvious I’m at everybodys
bloody mercy
(No one moves Finally)
I expect it will have to be pushed
now Do you mind Mellors

MELLORS
Not at all sir

Mellors tries to push the chair as Clifford starts the
engine Mellors’ breathing is labored - he coughs as he
pushes

CLIFFORD
For God’s sake what’s the matter
with you

MELLORS
Lungs are a bit knackered sir - a
little souvenir from the war

He continues to push exhausted by the effort Connie grabs
the front of the chair pulling

CLIFFORD
What the hell are you doing -

CONNIE
(Anger erupting )
He needs my help

In one tremendous effort Mellors heaves the chair free from
the mud He drops to his knees face white with the effort

CONNIE (CONTD)
Are you all right

Mellors nods unable to catch his breath He rises goes to
the back of the chair to push Connie hurries to help him

As they push the chair side by side Connie impulsively
leans forward to kiss Mellors on the cheek the back of
Clifford’s head just inches away

INT WRAGBY ENTRY HALLSTAIRS - DAY

Connie enters fuming Clifford follows now in his manual
wheelchair

CLIFFORD
I suppose the other chair will need
a different sort of wheel -

CONNIE
Who do you think you are How could
you treat him like that

CLIFFORD
Who The gamekeeper

CONNIE
He was injured in the war as well
If he’d been sitting in that chair
what would you have done for him

CLIFFORD
I find the comparison in bad taste

CONNIE
Well I find your lack of common
sympathy to be in the worst taste
imaginable You and your ruling
class I thought you were different
- but you’re not You make people
work for two pounds a week or
starve That’s not ruling Clifford
- that’s bullying with money

Connie storms upstairs leaving Clifford astounded and alone
EXT OUTSIDE MELLORS COTTAGE - DAY

Thunder The rains come down in earnest

INT MELLORS COTTAGE - DAY

Mellors sits by his fireplace repairing his shoe from a tear

it got while helping Clifford Connie enters looking for
him She doesn’t say anything for a long moment

MELLORS
Come on in then
CONNIE
I’m sorry for hurting you
(Beat )

I don’t want you for the sake of a
child Oliver I just want you
Alright

Mellors puts down his needle and thread softening

MELLORS
Alright

CONNIE
But Clifford has to believe that I
tried to keep us together That
this was his idea Just all gone
terribly wrong

Connie approaches searching his eyes

CONNIE (CONTD)
For him to give me a divorce

for us to be together he needs
to believe that
(A beat)

I just want to be with you If
that’s what you want

MELLORS
It’s not about wanting Connie You
know what I want

CONNIE
Do you hate Clifford

MELLORS
No I’ve known too many like him to
hate him He doesn’t feel like he’s
aman so he bullies and hides and
doesn’t know that anyone exists
other than himself

CONNIE
He was different when I met him Or
I thought he was I’m going to tell
him I’m leaving when I come back

MELLORS
A pregnant woman asking to leave
her husband Even if Clifford
agreed the courts wont
(After a beat)
I still need to get a divorce
myself

CONNIE
What happened with Bertha

MELLORS
It was a good deal my fault I was
a different man when I come back
from the war While I was gone she
carried on with other men and now
she refuses to divorce me

CONNIE
What about her other man

MELLORS
Ned He’s a big baby of a fellow
She bullies him they both drink
Bertha used to send him around to
harass me for my war pension

Connie can’t hold herself back any longer - she reaches out
for Mellors He grabs her hand pulls her into an embrace

MELLORS (CONTD)
Hey It’s alright Let’s not fight
(She kisses him he buries
his head against her)
I’m sorry

CONNIE
What if we were to just leave them
all behind Go to Australia or one
of the colonies anywhere

MELLORS

The three of us
CONNIE

(She nods)

Just our family Somewhere they
wouldn’t judge us

MELLORS
If there is such place
(Beat )

It seems a wrong and bitter thing
sometimes to bring a child into
this world

CONNIE
You don’t mean that

MELLORS
I do Don’t get me wrong - I’m
pleased for us But when I think of
what’s been done by those in power -
what leaders of men have done to
their so called fellow man
reduce them to less than human To
half-corpses Turned into insects
for labor sent off to be killed in
war - and those who do come home
find they’ve been forgotten

Pause Connie sighs and rises She crosses to the door
staring out at the rain

MELLORS (CONTD)
They think about naught but money
They live to make money But not
all of us have the freedom to live
life how we want Not all of us -

Suddenly impulsively Connie pulls off her stockings then
her dress Mellors watches in amazement as she slips off the
last of her underclothes then laughing runs out the door
into the rain

Astonished Mellors goes to the door watching as Connie
dances in the rain naked - clutching her breasts as she runs
in circles stooping low spreading her arms wide throwing
her wet hair back and drinking in raindrops

Mellors gives a wry laugh as he strips off his own clothes
EXT MELLORS COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Mellors runs naked out of the cottage shivering in the rain
laughing as he invents his own dance

Mellors approaches Connie circling playfully Her eyes flash
- she charges down the path wet boughs whipping her Mellors
catches up Connie shrieks laughing as he pulls her to him

The pounding rain steams off of them like smoke as Mellors
turns Connie to face him one hand catching her wrist
pinning her arm behind her the other gripping her buttocks

He moves to catch her lower lip between his Connie leans
back out of reach gestures for him to come closer Passion
flares - Mellors lifts Connie tipping her back against a
tree and then the two of them drop to the soft wet earth

INT ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

Clifford wheels himself around the hallway agitated Bolton
tries to calm him

CLIFFORD
But where is she She’s been gone
now more than two hours

MRS BOLTON
I’m sure it’s just the rain that’s
keeping her Sir She’s probably
sheltering in the hut

A pause Clifford taps anxiously at the windowsill

CLIFFORD
I’m going to send out Warren and
Betts to find her

MRS BOLTON
Oh no don’t you do that It will
only get people talking
(Heading into the hall)
(MORE)

MRS BOLTON (CONTD)
I‘1l slip on over to the hut and
see if she’s not there

back in no time

going to come back to the cottage

arms before I go

They break their kiss only moments before Mrs Bolton appears
on the path ahead hurrying straight towards them

MRS BOLTON
Oh my lady - there you are Sir
Clifford asked me to look for you
He was worried something had
happened

CONNIE
No I was just in the hut
sheltering from the rain

The two quickly separate Mrs Bolton glances to Mellors at
a loss what else to say

MELLORS
Evening Mrs Bolton Your Ladyship
will be all right now Goodnight to
you Goodnight to your Ladyship

He salutes and heads up the path Connie watches him go then
turns and strides angrily past Mrs Bolton toward Wragby

CONNIE
I am not a child It’s monstrous I
have to be followed
MRS BOLTON
Oh your Ladyship don’t say that
Sir Clifford was sure you’d been
struck by lightning He was going
to send Warren and Betts They
would’ve gone straight to the hut -

Connie slows She glances over at Bolton softening

CONNIE
It’s not your fault It’s foolish
of Clifford to worry

MRS BOLTON
Let’s go home now I’1l1 take care of
it It’s just as I told him - youve
only been sheltering in the hut

INT ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

Connie bursts into the entrance hall to confront Clifford
indignant Mrs Bolton lingers in the doorway out of mind

and view

CONNIE
I must say I don’t think you need
to send the servants after me

CLIFFORD
My God - where have you been
Youve been gone hours hours - and
in a storm like this What in the
name of hell have you been doing

CONNIE
What if I don’t choose to tell you
(Relenting slightly )
You’re acting as though I went to
Paris I sat in the hut and made a
fire

CLIFFORD
Look at your hair - look at yourself

CONNIE
Yes I had a shower of sorts I went
out in the rain with no clothes on

Mrs Bolton’s jaw drops Clifford is dumbfounded

CLIFFORD
What Are you mad Suppose Mellors
came while you were running around
with nothing on

CONNIE
Yes - suppose he had
(Glancing in a mirror)
You are right I really ought to
brush out my hair before it dries

Clifford watches in outraged silence as Connie leaves

HILDA
Are you going to tell me who he is

CONNIE

You can’t be serious

CONNIE

such an understanding and
tenderness He’s quite the
exception - you’ll see

HILDA
I’ve long hoped you would find
someone else - but one of
Cliffords servants

CONNIE

HILDA
(Furious exasperated )
Oh listen to you It’s you and
that German boy all over again -

CONNIE
No it isn’t Hilda It’s nothing
like that -

HILDA

It is Confusing sex with love -
and then thinking it can continue
just because it’s what you want
Please Connie - come to Venice and
take the time to think through what
you really want

CONNIE
(Exploding )
I know what I really want

HILDA
(Defiant )

watches her go fear and uncertainty in his eyes

MRS BOLTON

Hilda glances around at the humble furnishings She doesn’t
hide her distaste Mellors squints

CONNIE
Hilda

HILDA
What do you want me to say

MELLORS
Whatever it is you’re thinking

HILDA
Very well It is one thing to hold
trysts in your cottage but what
happens when you go out into the
world When Connie’s friends back
in London cross the street to avoid
her

CONNIE
Hilda that’s not fair -

MELLORS
You’ve got me figured then eh
What was it summed me up so quick
(In his Midlands accent)
Were it sumtin’ I said

HILDA
Mr Mellors How do you expect to
take care of her once you’ve lost
your job Do you actually believe
you can give her any chance at
happiness

MELLORS
Youre asking the wrong person
there I only know I get a great
deal of happiness from her

HILDA
Youve thought of your happiness
at least

CONNIE
Hilda enough

A beat Mellors glances to Connie who despite her resolve
has clearly been shaken by Hilda’s speech

HILDA

I think you understand far better
than she does how badly this could
end Think about how much she
really means to you

(She goes to the door )
I’1l pick you up in the morning
Connie Early Don’t keep me
waiting

still be your wife paperwork be
damned

MELLORS
And then what I won’t have a job

reference How’s that going to
work

Connie approaches Mellors sitting in his lap She drapes her
arms around him kisses his forehead

Ned moves further into the room trying to get a clearer view
of Mellors’ belongings Mellors raises his shotgun Flossie
growls

Now fuck off out of here - or I’1l
shoot you as a poacher

legs instead you strut in here
like a fool as though the only
accusation you face was having
forgotten to button your breeches

Well if I did forget at least I’d
have something to show for it

possibly expect me to claim that
child as my own now

CONNIE
I am sorry for how this has all
come about but we both know that
this marriage has been very unhappy
for a very long time now

CLIFFORD
It hasn’t been - not for me

CONNIE
Yes Because you laid out all the
rules And I tried to follow them
I tried to support you in every way
I could But you gave me nothing in
return

(MORE )
CONNIE (CONTD)
Not the slightest drop of affection
or kindness - and what’s worse you
made me feel ashamed for even
wanting those things

Clifford lowers his voice a wounded animal

CLIFFORD
That’s what this is really about
Youre ashamed of me

CONNIE
No This has nothing to do with
what happened to you - it’s never
been about that It’s about the way
you treat people The way you’ve
treated me I don’t think you’ve
ever had real feelings for anyone
but yourself

Clifford leans in beseeching - for a moment it sounds
though he genuinely wants to win Connie back

CLIFFORD
I have always cared for you Con

CONNIE
Yes Cared for me In the same way
you care for your books and for
your radio but never in the ways I
needed you to

CLIFFORD
I love you Connie I’ve loved you
the only way I know how I’ve given
you everything I know how to give

CONNIE
(After a beat)
It’s not enough

CLIFFORD
Then talk to me Con Help me
understand If there were any way I
could prove that to you how I
feel

CONNIE
There is Let me go Please

as

CLIFFORD
Go But know this I will never
grant you your divorce Because you
broke your word You made a mockery
of my life here in Wragby I’m not
inclined to give you anything

MRS BOLTON (CONTD)
I lost my Ted twenty-five years
ago He died in the Chatterley
mines and they blamed him for it

(The room quiets)

I never thought I’d meet another
woman loved a man as much But Lady
Chatterley does She gave up
everything for him Her title her
wealth her position in the world
Now she’s lost him

(MORE)

MRS BOLTON (CONTD)
Think what you like - but I’11 not
hear a word spoken against them
Theirs was a love story

END MONTAGE
EXT VENICE PIAZZA —- DAY

Connie sits in the same piazza as before gazing at pigeons
The square is filled with life but she takes no part in it

Two YOUNG BOYS kick a ball nearby shaking her out of her
thoughts As she rises and crosses out of the piazza it
becomes evident that she’s now several months pregnant

EXT CANAL SIDE CAFE - DAY

Connie walks along another canal past cafes where PATRONS
sip coffee and talk She slows then stops MICHAELIS holds
court with two women up ahead They listen attentively while
they walk with him leaning in as he tells them a story

Connie smiles and starts toward them briefly forgetting the
change in her circumstances - but when Michaelis makes eye
contact he averts his gaze and crosses a nearby bridge
pretending not to have noticed her

Michaelis keeps his smile fixed on his companions as Connie
nears but there is fear in his eyes as well - because after
all his acceptance among the elite is conditional at best

Connie lowers her gaze and walks onward Guilt clouds
Michaelis’s face for a moment then he continues his story

INT THE VILLA ESMERELDA BALCONY - EVENING

GUESTS at the villa have drinks on the balcony Connie stands
with Hilda listening as Sir Malcolm talks with their HOST
Connie notices THREE WOMEN across the room - it is not hard
to tell they’re gossiping about her Connie turns to Hilda

CONNIE
This place is losing its charm
Let’s go back to London shall we

HILDA
What

Hilda looks towards the gossiping women then to her sister

HILDA (CONTD)
Ah All right

Connie crosses to the women says something that instantly
silences them then crosses back taking Hilda by the arm

EXT THE ALPS - DAY

A Chauffeur drives Hilda and Connie through the ALPS - headed
back toward France and passage home

EXT OUTSIDE MALCOLM’S TOWNHOUSE AUTUMN - DAY
Autumn The leaves have begun to turn

Connie sits just outside the home reading a book She is
noticeably pregnant now - perhaps four or five months along

Hilda steps outside to grab the post sorting mail She
hesitates over one then crosses to Connie sits facing her
Connie looks up

CONNIE
- What

HILDA
How many times have you read that
page

Connie smiles Hilda nods confirming something

HILDA (CONTD)
Well It looks as though he’s
found you

Connie’s breath catches Hilda hands the letter to Connie
She tears it open and reads overwhelmed by her emotions

CONNIE
Oh my god

HILDA
Youll want my car again I
imagine

IE THE CARENGLISH FOREST - DAY
As Connie drives through an English forest we hear

MELLORS (LETTER VO)
You’ll be impressed to learn that
word of your departure from Wragby
has made it all the way to my
little village in Scotland A man
came to work in the local mines
brought the tale with him telling
everyone in the pub about a Lady
who fell for a hired man and didn’t
care if the whole world knew it -
“Because she loved him”

IE THE CARSCOTTISH VALLEY - DAY
The car winds through a valley in the Scottish countryside

MELLORS (LETTER VO)
Names weren’t used of course I
was simply the gamekeeper you were
the Lady in love

Connie drives up past a craggy Scottish farm A SHEPHERD is
herding sheep across the road ahead She slows the car
frustrated then climbs out and walks to the farmhand

CONNIE
Excuse me I’m looking for Oliver
Mellors Do you know him

SHEPHERD
(Nodding )
He’s down that road

Connie’s eyes brighten She races back to her car

CONNIE
Thank you Thank you so much

MELLORS (LETTER VO)
It was a good story and I found
myself wondering if there might be
more to the tale

EXT HILLSIDE IN SCOTLAND - DAY

Connie parks her car at the bottom of a steep hillside
without a road She steps out and makes her way up the rise

MELLORS (LETTER VO)
A fellow I knew from the army got
me work at a farm here 30
shillings a week and decent
lodgings in a cottage up the
road I said I needed a purpose
before bringing you and a child
into my life

As Connie crests the top of the hill she sees a small stone
cottage in the far distance

MELLORS (LETTER VO) (CONTD)
I can’t say I’ve found any greater
meaning here on the farm but I’ve
made a home

IE MELLORS’ NEW COTTAGE SCOTLAND - DAY

Connie arrives at a stone cottage She raps at the door No
answer She peers through the window then walks around the
side of the cottage There is no one there

MELLORS (LETTER VO)
I can’t imagine what you’ve already
been through and how much you’ve
already given up You’d be giving
up even more to come live here with
me

Connie checks an open shed - Mellors is not there either
She continues circling the cottage

CONNIE
(Calling out)
Oliver

MELLORS (LETTER VO)
But what we have is different
than anything I’ve ever known
There’s a little flame between us -
it’s always burning

Connie comes to a stop in front of the cottage scanning the
horizon Mellors investigating steps out from beyond the
far wall and sees Connie

MELLORS (LETTER VO) (CONTD)
- And I’ve come to believe that
tending a fire like that is purpose
enough for any life

Connie turns around sees Mellors stops He approaches her
Connie takes his hand and rests it on her pregnant belly
Mellors smiles Connie slowly draws him into her arms and
kisses him She finally breaks the kiss and rests her head on
Mellors’ shoulder pulling him close

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
