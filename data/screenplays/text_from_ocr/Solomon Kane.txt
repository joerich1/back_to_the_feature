FADE UP ON

EXT NORTH AFRICAN COASTAL TOWN —- NIGHT

A BRILLIANT NIGHT SKY Cloudless and pure with a dazzling
array of stars

BURNING EMBERS drift upwards followed by tongues of FIRE
reaching into the blackness

Then the SOUND of FEROCIOUS COMBAT rises Swords clashing
pistols roaring along with the cries of the dying

The stars and embers are suddenly replaced by THE FACE OF A
FIERCE WARRIOR He screams a ferocious challenge There’s
murder in his eyes as

-he raises a vicious scimitar it catches the light of
the fires nearby and he

-- HAS A HOLE BLOWN THROUGH HIS HEAD

As the victim collapses out of frame we see the killer
still holding his two smoking MATCHLOCK PISTOLS - this is
SOLOMON KANE swordsman Naval Captain mercenary
buccaneer and servant of the Queen of England He turns to
the MEN following him

KANE
No mercy to heathens Advance

He smoothly holsters his pistols and unsheathes his two
signature swords - a CUTLASS and a RAPIER

He deflects a flurry of attacks from his enemies and cuts
them down without a thought It is obvious he is a martial
expert with these weapons as he drives forward

SOLOMON KANE is in his early thirties but it’s hard tell
through the history of violence and adventure which has
weathered his face He’s masculine but wolf slim with long
dark hair tied back intense predatory eyes and pale skin
now spattered in the blood of his victims He’s dressed in
ornate expensive clothes where somewhere beneath all the
finery is the uniform of a Captain in the Queens Navy With
the trims and excess of his own choosing he looks unique
and exotic - a murderous dandy

Kane hacks at another of the city’s defenders Sidesteps
yet another sweeping scimitar and delivers death with every
thrust of his rapier He is unstoppable
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 2

At his back Kane’s own PLATOON OF MARINES follow Equally
relentless and bloodthirsty as their commander are a wedge
of PIKEMEN ARCHERS and SWORDSMEN driving further and
further into the city’s defences

Further behind still is the SEA PORT where they entered
this glittering exotic and magical city where an ENGLISH
NAVAL TALL SHIP is moored The HARBOUR and MUCH OF THE CITY
BY THE SHORE IS BURNING FIERCELY The path of destruction
and fire is like a wake left behind by Kane’s advance

The whole city seems to be in a panic WOMAN and CHILDREN
screaming in fear MEN rushing to defend their homes
NATIVE WARRIORS launching attacks on Kane’s soldiers but
nothing seems to be able to stop them

One of KANE’S OWN MEN rushes past him fleeing from a MOB
of the city’s defenders Kane pulls a pistol takes aim
He SHOOTS HIS OWN MAN IN THE BACK The man crashes to the
ground screaming as a dozen scimitar blades hack him to
pieces

KANE
(under his breath)
Faithless coward

Kane sweating and blood-spattered dashes forward eyes
gleaming

KANE
On-me men See there’s our goal

Perched on the cliff overlooking the city is a CASTLE OF
BLACK OBSIDIAN Almost organic in its lines and
architecture it sits impassive a careless guardian of the
burning city beneath

A handful of his men make it to his side Fighting all the
way One LIEUTENANT MALTHUS at Kane’s shoulder

MALTHUS
Captain what about the prisoners
were supposed to rescue

KANE
Malthus you take care of that

MALTHUS
What are you going to do Captain

Kane grins like a wolf
KANE
I have a different prize in mind

Cooper

COOPER a great brute of a man fights his way towards Kane
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 3

KANE
Send half the men with Malthus

COOPER
And the rest

KANE
See that black tower ahead

COOPER
Aye

KANE
It’s the one the slave girl told
us about

COOPER

You don’t believe her Solomon
She would have said anything to
save herself There’s no fortune
to be had

KANE
Perhaps but I’1l be long dead
before I pass up a chance like
this

MALTHUS
Is that the real reason we came
to this barbarian place Captain
just to line your pockets
further

Kane laughs even as they both stop to fight off a FRESH
WAVE OF ATTACKERS

KANE
You have no ambition Malthus
that’s your principal failing

MALTHUS
At least I know the difference
between good and evil

KANE
Which is why you will never have
the riches or power that I have
Now follow your orders

CUT TO

INT OBSIDIAN CASTLE - NIGHT MOMENTS LATER

DOZENS OF DEFENDING CASTLE GUARDS are slamming the heavy
main doors and barricading them Holding the wooden bar in
place as
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 4

More and more SOLDIERS push in to defend All marshalled by
the inner doors of the obsidian castle they are heavily
armed disciplined and eager for a fight

But SUDDENLY those doors SMASH INWARDS with a HUGE
EXPLOSION of fire and gunpowder that TEARS THE HEAVY DOORS
OFF THEIR HINGES

The SOLDIERS ARE BLOWN APART The lucky ones are flung
aside by the blast as a VORTEX OF FLAME howls down the
hallway - tapestries artwork and people all engulfed in
the inferno

The GUARDS lie dead or dying A wall of flame burns in the
doorway

A FIGURE walks through the flames leading a DOZEN MEN

He moves like a wolf focussed and deadly Long hair
flying black cloak whipped by the hot air and intense dark
eyes scanning the dead This is SOLOMON KANE

Kane stops before one of the cowering GUARDS and levels his
pistol at the man

KANE
Where is the throne room

He repeats the line in the native language aggressive
commanding

The man shields his face and points indicating the
direction and spitting out instructions

KANE takes in the information and then SHOOTS THE MAN
POINT BLANK

KANE
(to his men)
This way

As KANE leads HIS DOZEN MEN further into the castle he
shoots and stabs every last one of the defenders

KANE SLAUGHTERS EVERY SURVIVOR No one is spared

INT OBSIDIAN CASTLE GALLERY OF MIRRORS - CONT

KANE and his MEN pass through inner doors and advance
cautiously into the heart of the castle There’s no
further resistance now but no one is lowering their guard

They enter a huge room filled with columns between which
hang VAST BLACK MIRRORS There are strange symbols etched
into the surface - magical and ornate rich in meaning
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 5

COOPER
What is this place

SOLDIER 1
We shouldn’t be here Can’t you
feel it

One of the soldier’s turns sharply

SOLDIER 2
There’s something in here with
us

KANE

(hissing to his men)
Quiet Keep moving

The other soldiers look around nervously but there’s
nowhere for anything to hide

Kane studies his own reflection as he passes a mirror In
the surface he sees SOMETHING BEHIND HIM He whirls round
to confront his enemy but THERE IS NOTHING THERE apart from
an infinity of his own image caught between mirrors on the
opposite wall

A little unnerved he advances His men follow

As the last few men begin to move on again DARK FIGURES
SUDDENLY REACH OUT FROM WITHIN THE MIRRORS BLACK SKELETAL
ARMS EMBRACE KANE’S MEN

With muffled screams HALF OF THE SOLDIERS vanish dragged
back through the now liquid glass by the demons within

The doors of the corridor SLAM SHUT BEHIND THE OTHERS The
remaining men start to panic Swords and pistols at the
ready but no enemy in sight One sees his companion falling
backwards into the darkness of the mirror

SOLDIER
Captain

KANE
Hold steady

SOLDIER
There is devilry I know it

Kane grabs the man snarling
KANE
I am the only devil here Now

move

Now the DOORS AHEAD OF THEM SWING OPEN
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 6

An invitation to advance into

INT THRONE ROOM —- CONT

KANE strides eagerly across the threshold into the THRONE
ROOM A cavernous ornate space filled with grotesque
statues of twisted figures caught in helpless agony

KANE
This is it lads We’ve found it

He turns to his men - just as the throne room doors SLAM
SHUT BEHIND HIM cutting him off from his companions He
tries to tear the heavy doors open but they will not move
There are no handles no way to escape

He can hear SCREAMS from beyond the doors A few brief
moments of terror one or two GUNSHOTS and cries of pain
and then nothing but SILENCE

He turns back to the throne room and looks about him
Little light filters through the stained glass windows but
just enough to illuminate

the TREASURE piled around a vast high-backed black
THRONE on a raised dais ahead VAST WEALTH laid casually
about in glittering mounds

Unafraid Kane steps further into the throne room It seems
deserted but he is ready with his weapons

KANE
Show yourself Or shall I take
your treasure unopposed

Still nothing Kane moves slowly forwards He reaches down
to pick up some of the treasures then notices THE CORPSE OF
THE KING lying beside his throne Kane is suddenly unsure

He whirls around to confront a sound but there is no one
there

KANE
Show yourself You should

He stops in mid sentence unnerved as THE SHADOWS AROUND
THE ROOM SEEM TO MOVE AND TWIST before him

The air in the room freezes his breath billows around him
clouds now

A CRACKING BREAKING SOUND echoes around the room as ICE
TENDRILS BEGIN TO SNAKE ACROSS the floor towards the
THRONE
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 7

FINGERS OF SMOKE AND SHADOW twist a whirl on the throne as
little by little a SHAPE APPEARS

A FIGURE seemingly CLOTHED in BLACK SHADOWS that shift and
change around him It must be a man but it is so hard to
see beyond the darkness that envelopes him For fleeting
heart-stopping moments the darkness takes form - something
awful and corrupt - before becoming hazy and indistinct
once again

Then the figure speaks The voice seems to be coming from
the very air itself Powerful resonant insidious and
beguiling This is the Devil’s Reaper

REAPER
Solomon Kane Soldier pirate
thief warrior murderer

Kane holds his ground but knows he’s in trouble

KANE
You think I have not met
sorcerers in my travels I have
no fear of you

A subsonic rumble fills the room Kane says he has no fear
but he’s growing nervous now

REAPER
I am no mere sorcerer Kane You
know me You know my master He
is your master too

KANE
I have no master save the Queen
Iam ake

REAPER
NO

It is a shattering sound The power drives Kane to his
knees

A darkness swallows the room for a moment and when it
passes there are low MOANS OF PAIN coming from all around
the throne room Kane sees in the gloomy half-light
FIGURES HANGING FROM THE WALLS

His MEN CRUCIFIED FLAYED IMPALED all around

The REAPER RISES and slowly advances on Kane He moves with
a savage predatory grace Beautiful and menacing

REAPER
Your time is over Kane Your deal
is done I have been sent to
claim His prize
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 8

KANE
I made no deal

REAPER
When you killed your first
innocent in greed and lust you
made your pact with Him

Kane struggles to his feet again

KANE
I am a soldier I killed only

REAPER
NO

Once more the sound is like a hammer blow knocking Kane to
his hands and knees

REAPER
You are a butcher Revelling in
the fear and torment you brought
with you

KANE
(quietly)
No

REAPER (CONT)

And were you not rewarded With
power With wealth With fame
Everything you desired

As the spectre finally stands over him Kane looks up and
stares into the abyss of the shadow’s face there are
burning eyes deep within a ghastly predatory face that
shifts and twists with each word

REAPER
You know who I serve

Kane tries to catch his breath His world is spinning as he
realises just what he is facing

KANE
You you cannot take my soul

REAPER
You have already lost it
Bow your head before me

Kane sees now in the Demon’s hand A SWORD A blade of
seething molten metal Runes and patterns flow across its
surface

REAPER
You are damned
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 9

Defeated Kane does slowly bow his head The Reaper
raises the sword above him preparing to strike the death
blow

It sweeps down with incredible force only to be met by

-KANE’S TWO SWORDS BLOCKING its path Kane rises to his
feet Teeth gritted eyes blazing

KANE
Tell your master I will not be
going to Hell

Even in the face of this pure evil Kane will not be
defeated He stares into the abyss once more unflinching
though still full of fear now

KANE
The Lord protects me

Kane paries another sweeping thrusts but the burning blade
slices through his rapier

REAPER
Fool He does not want you You
are damned

Kane blocks a return thrust which destroys his cutlass

Unarmed now Kane slowly backs away as the Reaper advances
on him again There’s nowhere for him to go

REAPER
On your knees

KANE
Never I will never give myself
to you

Kane charges at the HUGE STAINED GLASS WINDOW and smashes
through an image of Demons and Angels locked in eternal
conflict

The glass shatters revealing the burning city and the
night sky beyond but nothing below apart from the sea
crashing onto jagged rocks hundreds of feet beneath

With a desolate cry Kane plummets down into the void with
the words of the Devil ringing in his ears

REAPER
You cannot escape us Wherever
you go we will find youYour
soul is lost

FADE TO BLACK
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 10

A TERRIBLE SCREAM against the blackness
TITLE SOLOMON KANE

FADE UP ON

EXT MONASTERY - DAWN

An ISOLATED GREY STONE MONASTERY on a windswept hillside
The first pale splashes of a chill silver dawn bring
little hope for the day to come

INT MONASTERY CORRIDOR - CONT DAWN

TWO MONKS in their heavy hooded robes carry a tray of water
and bread along the cloisters of an open courtyard Their
breath steams around them

Other MONKS go silently about their business

YOUNG MONK
How long has he been here

OLDER MONK
Nearly a year

YOUNG MONK
A year Master I do not
understand why we serve this man

OLDER MONK
We do not serve him He sought
sanctuary here and that is what
we offer Are you a novice to
judge him

They stop outside a door

YOUNG MONK
I hear his screams in the night

OLDER MONK
We all do You might scream too
if you’d seen what he has

YOUNG MONK
(awed)
Then what they say about him is
true

The older monk casts a withering eye on the novice

OLDER MONK
What do they say Thomas
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 1

A nervous pause The young monk is not sure he should even
say this out loud

YOUNG MONK
That he met that Satan
himself came for his soul but he
would not relinquish it That his
body is marked with runes and
spells to keep him from the sight
of the Dark One

OLDER MONK
A lesser man would be out of his
mind by now but Kane he is

unlike any other

The older monk knocks on Kane’s door

INT KANE’S MONASTIC CELL - CONT 8

The KNOCK on Kane’s door is followed by a gentle creaking
as it opens slowly The two monks respectfully enter the
gloomy room as Kane remains silent but watchful in his cot

OLDER MONK
Solomon

A voice comes from a dark corner

KANE 0S
Brother Fletcher how does the
day find you

OLDER MONK
As the Lord intended cold of
bone and stiff of joint
We have a little breakfast for
you

KANE OS
Who is this novice

OLDER MONK
He joined us only a few days ago

Kane levers himself to the edge of his bed and into the
flickering amber light of a candle The Kane of now is a
man of small gestures and quiet almost diffident talk -
the brash aggressive buccaneer of before has long since
vanished He has aged His hair is longer a stubbly beard
is flecked with grey hair His eyes are haunted

The YOUNG NOVICE draws breath sharply as he notices Kane’s
NAKED TORSO Kane’s body has been marked with elaborate
cuts and tattoos Some fresh others old and scarred over -
his skin is a text of its own
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 12

The walls of the room itself are covered in similar WRITING
and SYMBOLS Runes hexes spells and text have been
carved or painted onto the walls There are dozens of
books and scrolls around the room Religious and spiritual
texts lie alongside books on witchcraft and sorcery

YOUNG MONK
(stunned)
Your body

OLDER MONK
Still your tongue
(to Kane)
Forgive him Solomon he is young

KANE
(to the novice)
Didn’t you know I am a marked
man

Thomas cannot help but stare

YOUNG MONK
Do they really protect you
from

ABBOT 0OS

Mind who you name in this holy
place novice

A SHADOW falls across the open doorway They turn to see
the ABBOT Both monks bow their heads as the Abbot enters
the room

ABBOT
Leave us

The monks hurry out as the Abbot closes the door behind
them He is an elderly man stern and devout but not
unkind He scrutinizes the room taking in the desecration
around him He eyes Kane silently

ABBOT
Once again we heard your cries at
matins

KANE

I didn’t mean to disturb your
prayers My dreams haunt me even
here

ABBOT
You would do well to listen to
what they tell you

KANE
They tell me I am damned
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 13

The Abbot examines the books and texts on a table He is
not pleased by what he sees a Bible with scribblings and
notes over the text Other books clearly full of magic and
pagan spells

ABBOT
And yet you still defile our
sacred text And these others
such dark works

KANE
They are just books Abbot

ABBOT
If you believed words had no
power you would never have
corrupted your own flesh so Men
have been burned for less

KANE
I am no heretic

ABBOT
I know that my son but these are
not times of tolerance If
someone were to ever find out
that we harboured you there would
be questions

Kane climbs from the bed and gathers his papers together
returning them to his wooden chest and closing the lid

KANE
Who would know I live here in
solitude I have renounced
violence given up my power
Given my wealth to the church

ABBOT
And we are grateful for all your
gifts to us
(about the books)
You don’t need this witchcraft to
hide from evil God protects his
own

KANE
But I am not one of God’s own am
I But how can I redeemed myself
in His eyes when I know the
servants of darkness are
searching for me

Kane falls silent The Abbot sits
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 14

ABBOT
Solomon these months you have
been here I have felt a shadow
growing over us all And when I
prayed for guidance I
(a beat)

I do not see a way for you to
remain

(a long pause)
You must leave us

KANE
Leave No

ABBOT
I am sorry

KANE
Please Abbot this is sanctuary

But Kane sees the resolve in the Abbot’s face

KANE
Where can I go

ABBOT
Go home

KANE
No

ABBOT

You are of noble birth I know
you have lands in the west

KANE
No

ABBOT
Solomon I

KANE

I cannot return home

ABBOT
Nor can you remain

CUT TO

EXT MONASTERY GATES —- DAY

High winds sweep rain horizontally against the stone walls
of the monastery as the GATES OPEN

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 15

Kane is standing there Long staff in his hand hat pulled
low and heavy wool cloak wrapped about him Just a few
bags of his personal possessions are slung over his
shoulder

Several MONKS are by the gate One of them hands hima
small parcel of food They watch silently and CROSS
THEMSELVES as he steps over the threshold and into the
unknown

INT MONASTERY - CONT 10

Watching from a high window the ABBOT and the OLDER MONK
see Kane set out

OLDER MONK
Are you doing right by sending
him back into the world

ABBOT
My dreams said he must be sent

from here I listen to what I am
told

The Abbot watches Kane stride away

OLDER MONK
Can Kane bring anything but
destruction and pain

ABBOT
Perhaps that is what is needed in
these darkening times He wants
redemption for his sins there
are many paths to God not all of
them peaceful

MIX TO

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 11
KANE makes his way across the lonely hills and valleys of
this desolate part of the country

EXT COUNTRYSIDE HAMLET - LATER DAY 12
In driving rain KANE passes by a TINY GROUP OF NEARLY
DERELICT HOUSES A MOTHER wails in distress as the FATHER
digs GRAVES for several dead children wrapped in cloth at

their feet The mother watches Kane pass with dead eyes

MIX TO

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 16

EXT MOORLAND - LATER DAY 13

The DRIVING RAIN has eased The landscape clothed in dank
fog It fills the hollows and clings to the rocks The
cold settles into Kane’s bones as he makes his way across
open ground

From behind him he hears the SOUND of a WAGON rattling
towards him He turns to see it emerge like a vast ghost
through the fog It’s a FAMILY driving their covered wagon
Kane steps out of their way to allow them to pass

The DRIVER nods and slows his wagon A young BOY looks at
Kane from the back of the wagon

DRIVER
Can we offer you a ride pilgrim
These roads ahead should not be
travelled alone

KANE
My thanks friend but no

DRIVER
As you wish God be with you

The driver urges his horses onwards and soon he and his
family are swallowed in the mist once again

Kane hefts his bags and settles into his stride down the
path

Up ahead the fog suddenly seems to darken as the tree line
of a FOREST comes into view

MIX TO

EXT WOODLAND PATH - LATER 14
Thicker fog in these trees now The damp dripping from the
branches and the cold clinging to Kane’s woollen cape The
trees seem to press in on him A flock of birds taking
flight noisily sets him on edge

He comes to a fork in the path and stops to consider

A creaking in the trees leads him to look up and see FOUR
HUMAN CORPSES swing from several branches in the trees All
hanging by nooses some with their INNARDS DRAWN OUT

KANE chooses a path and presses on

CUT TO

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 17

EXT WOODLAND PATH —- LATER DAY 15

Still in the depths of the ancient forest KANE has set
himself a small camp to the side of the track A tiny fire
is flickering heating water as he chews some bread

A MOVEMENT AMONG THE TREES draws his attention he sits up
attentively but sees nothing

Then from behind him A KNIFE IS PRESSED TO HIS THROAT

VOICE 0S
Move and you die

Kane is forced to his feet by a heavy-set SKINHEAD THIEF
who whistles to his TWO COMPANIONS who are lurking in the
undergrowth One is heavily TATTOOED whilst the other is
massively built with a HEAVY BRAIDED BEARD They are a
feral and dangerous group and enjoying their brutal work

KANE
I want no trouble

BEARD SMASHES Kane in the stomach with a heavy cudgel Kane
doubles and falls to the ground coughing

BEARD
Too bad Youve already got it

They begin to search through his bags There’s almost
nothing of interest or value BEARD empties Kane’s bag of
scrolls and books The few coins some food and other items
are taken The thieves are not happy

BEARD
He’s got nothing You a priest

KANE
A traveller

BEARD
Travelling where

KANE
Nowhere Just take what you want

BEARD
Don’t worry pilgrim we will

Kane keeps his head down TATTOO stares at the scrolls

TATTOO
Look at these I say he’s a
sorcerer See here these is
magical symbols

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 18

Tattoo grabs Kane by the hair and drags him to the fire

TATTOO
Should we burn you for a witch

Tattoo’s companions cheer him on as he pushes Kane’s face
near to the flames Kane does not fight but resists and no
matter how hard Tattoo pushes he cannot make Kane move
Finally Kane yanks his head free and stares hard into
Tattoo’s eyes The thief flinches from the deadly look

TATTOO
There’s murder in your eyes
traveller Would you kill me

KANE
No

TATTOO
You won’t kill the men who steal
from you

KANE
I will not fight another man

SKINHEAD slaps Kane sends him reeling back Kane slowly
climbs to his feet The robbers laugh

SKINHEAD
You worthless coward Fight me

KANE
I will not fight you I have
renounced violence

BEARD
We havent

BEARD SMASHES KANE ACROSS THE HEAD with his wooden cudgel
CUT TO BLACK

STERN VOICE VO
You will do as I say boy

Through the darkness STERN MAN’S FACE swims into view
through the smoke and mist of Kane’s memory He looms down
onto Kane This is his FATHER

INT AXMOUTH CASTLE GREAT HALL —- DAY 16

FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SOLOMON KANE is standing defiantly before
his father’s high chair at the head of the Great Hall of
his castle home Various SERVANTS and HANGERS-ON mill
about but they are trying to avoid the conflict that is
raging between father and son
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 19

KANE
No

KANE’S FATHER
You are the second son and Marcus
is my heir Your brother will be
master of these lands on my
death

KANE
Marcus is a brute and

KANE’S FATHER
(talking him down)
-e-And you you will join the
church as is tradition

KANE
I do not wish to be a priest I
want to go to sea

KANE’S FATHER
What you want is of no importance
Solomon I have arranged with
Father Simnal for you to
accompany him to the abbey

At his father’s signal FATHER SIMNAL who has been sitting
nearby steps up and nods politely to Kane

KANE
I have no interest in the church
or its teachings I will not go

KANE’S FATHER
Then you will have nothing I
will cut you off You will be a
landless vagrant Is that what
you want

Kane turns from his father and storms out

KANE’S FATHER
If you walk out now you may
never return Do not defy me

His Father’s words are ringing in young Kane’s ears as he
flings back the doors to the great hall

And there suddenly looming before him is the DEVILS
REAPER - BURNING SWORD in hand The Demon swings the blade
and CUTS KANE DOWN even as Kane screams out in pain and
fear

CUT TO

INT COVERED WAGON —- DAY 17

KANE wakes with a sudden cry to find a YOUNG WOMAN leaning
over him concerned Talking gently soothing

MEREDITH
Be calmbe calm Sir You are
safe
(calling off)
Father

Kane tries to speak but he’s delirious and confused His
face is bloodied and swollen his body bruised and stiff

MEREDITH
HereTake a little water

But Kane fades back into unconsciousness again
FADE TO BLACK

MEREDITH VO
You are safe here

EXT SEA CLIFFS - DAY 18

Beneath a threatening sky and with the imposing grandeur of
AXMOUTH CASTLE in the distance YOUNG KANE wanders the
windswept sea cliffs away from his home He has his
travelling bags slung over his shoulder clearly ready for
the road

The open ocean sweeps out in front to the distant horizon
A few TALL SHIPS OF THE NAVY cruise past Solomon watches
them envious as DISTANT SHOUTS from the crew drift to him

Then he hears a SUDDEN SHARP SCREAM from nearby He drops
his bags and rushes round a corner to see a very tall
POWERFUL YOUNG MAN overpowering a PRETTY YOUNG GIRL He’s
tearing at her clothes clearly trying to rape her

KANE DRAWS A SHORT KNIFE from his belt and rushes forward
grabbing the youth and pulling him back

KANE
Stop

--only to halt stunned when the older youth turns on
him

KANE
Marcus
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 21

MARCUS
(mocking )
Little brother I heard you had
run away Fleeing the life of a
holy man

KANE
Marcus you must not do this
(to the girl)
Sarah are you hurt

SARAH
Solomon he was trying to

Marcus slaps the girl to silence

MARCUS
Quiet I gave you no permission
to speak
(to Kane)
This is not your concern
Solomon Be on your way

Kane advances on Marcus and pulls Sarah from his grasp

KANE
No Let her go Sarah run Go
now

Sarah races away Kane squares up to his brother Marcus
is immense in stature far taller and more powerfully built
than his whip-thin younger brother

MARCUS
You shouldn’t get between a
master and his pleasure

KANE
Is that how it’s going to be when
you are Lord here nothing but
greed and cruelty

MARCUS
(about Kane’s knife)
What were you going to do with
that little toothpick

KANE
Teach you some humility to
accompany your power

MARCUS
I don’t think you’re the one to
teach me anything little brother

Marcus suddenly grabs Kane’s arm twists it hard and
snatches the knife from him

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 22

He presses it to his Kane’s throat drawing a little blood
Whispering savagely in his brother’s ear

MARCUS
I am the first-born I am the
heir and that means I am your
master too You will never be
anything more than a coward
fleeing your duty Take your bags
and leave this land

Marcus pushes Kane away In fury Kane turns and shoves his
brother back towards the cliff edge Caught by surprise
Marcus stumbles back and trips on a rock

With a cry he TOPPLES BACKWARDS OVER THE EDGE OF THE
CLIFF

Kane desperately reaches for Marcus’s flailing hand but
cannot save him

MARCUS
Brother Save me

He falls

Kane scrambles to the edge only to see fifty feet below

the SHATTERED BODY OF HIS BROTHER still twitching on the
rocks below His head has been crushed in his jaw partly

torn away

All Kane can see through the mask of blood on his brothers
destroyed face are his eyes staring furiously back at
him

CUT TO

INT COVERED WAGON —- DAY 19

This time Kane wakes in slow silence No screaming just
muted sadness and pain as he opens his bleary eyes onto the
wagon

A twelve year old boy SAMUEL is looking through some bags
nearby He is working silently and doesn’t notice Kane is
awake and watching him

KANE
Boy

Samuel turns and yells in fear and scrambles out of the
wagon

SAMUEL OS
(yelling)
He’s awake Father That man
he’s awake

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 23

Kane tries to right himself but hasn’t the energy He
groans in pain

The flaps of the wagon cover are drawn back Faces are
silhouetted against the daylight that pours in

INT COVERED WAGON —- MOMENTS LATER

The young woman MEREDITH is holding Kane’s head as she
puts a flask to his lips He drinks Finally finds his
voice

KANE
(faintly)
Whoare you

The man by Meredith’s side is WILLIAM CROWTHORN In his
50’s he has an air solemn kindness and gentle good humour
about him He’s dressed in the simple DARK CLOTHES OF A
PURITAN as are all his family

Meredith mops Kane’s brow
MEREDITH

He is still fevered Father

WILLIAM
It has broken He will be well
(to Kane)

Sir my name is William
Crowthorn This is my daughter
Meredith And you met quite
briefly my son Samuel My
eldest Edward is driving this
wagon and my wife Katherine is
outside also

Samuel peers in nervously from outside

KANE
Where are you taking me

WILLIAM
We prayed for you Meredith has
nursed you these past days All
of us have spent time at you
side

Kane tries to rise again He’s wounded and weak but
fighting

KANE
Where are you taking me

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 24

WILLIAM
There are many evils on this road
but we are not among them You
are safe and on the road heading
west to Plymouth

KANE

MEREDITH
We’re bound for the New World

Kane studies the man for a moment

KANE
I know you You offered me a
ride

WILLIAM

KANE

beating but in a few days the
Lord willing you will be fit

camp for the night

CUT TO

EXT RIVERSIDE CAMP - SUNSET 21

The COVERED CART is driven by EDWARD William’s eldest son
and a serious young man in his mid 20’s Though all the
family are dressed as Puritans only Edward wears the dog-
collar and garb of a PRIEST

Beside him on the bench is William’s wife KATHERINE a
bright and homely woman in her 50’s SAMUEL is walking
besides the cart swatting the long grass with a stick

EDWARD guides the cart to some open ground beside a crystal
clear river It is an idyllic spot in a picturesque
valley

MEREDITH and KATHERINE are gathering together cooking
utensils and food stuff for the evening meal

sleeping by the wagon Young SAMUEL is exploring nearby

KATHERINE
Don’t stray too far Samuel

EDWARD
Samuel water the horses
(Samuel ignores him)
Samuel

WILLIAM
Samuel Edward has given you a
task set to it

Reluctantly and muttering Samuel unhitches the horses and
lead them to the river

KANE steps out of the wagon still a little unsteady
Katherine is surprised to see him

KATHERINE
Master Kane you should be
resting

KANE

I can hardly repay your
hospitality by being idle
Mistress Crowthorn Allow me a
moment to wash and then I’11 help
as I can

Katherine watches as Kane limps down towards the water’s
edge

EXT RIVERSIDE - EVENING A LITTLE LATER 23

KANE kneels beside the waters Some way along from him
SAMUEL supervises the horses as they drink He eyes Kane
nervously

KANE
What is your name boy

Samuel doesn’t reply

KANE
Don’t fear me What is your name
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 26

MEREDITH comes to the river she stops nearby Kane and
begins to fill a water-skin

KANE
Your little brother has lost his
tongue I think

MEREDITH
Remember your manners with our
guest Samuel

Kane pulls his torn and blood-stained shirt off to reveal
his bruised body - along with the tattoos and scars

Meredith is shocked by what she sees Kane notices Samuel
too is astounded by the marks and patterns on Kane’s body

MEREDITH
HowWhat are they

KANE
These They are the story of my
life See

Meredith comes a little nearer fascinated

KANE
Some are of my own making these
marks and symbols here

MEREDITH
What do they mean

KANE
They are for protection
Others here are wounds

MEREDITH
How were you hurt

Kane points to a deep scar on his shoulder

KANE
I’ve been shot stabbed and
beaten more times than I recall
This here was a spear thrust by
a tribesman of Africa

MEREDITH
Africa You were at sea

KANE
I was a Captain

Samuel suddenly comes alive with interest
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 27

SAMUEL
You were a sea Captain

24 EXT CAMPFIRE AREA —- NIGHT 24

KANE sits with the rest of the FAMILY around the camp fire
their heads are bowed in prayer as EDWARD reads from a
prayer book

EDWARD
Holy Lord I have sinned times
without number and been guilty
of pride and unbelief

Kane lifts his head at these pointedly accurate words and
looks at the family caught in the flickering firelight He
catches Meredith looking too but embarrassed she quickly
closes her eyes again

EDWARD (CONT)

25 EXT CAMPFIRE AREA —- NIGHT LATER 25

They are all eating hungrily now The simple stew has been
well received

KANE
This is a fine meal Mistress
Crowthorn my thanks

WILLIAM
My Katherine can make a meal from
anything Leather shoes and
nettles one time wasn’t it

KATHERINE
It was not

SAMUEL
It tasted like it

The family laugh at this
KATHERINE

Samuel tells us you were the
Captain of a ship
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett

KANE
I commanded the Queen’s frigate
Tiercel

WILLIAM
Did you fight the Spanish

KANE
I have fought everyone at some
time Off The Main the
Caribbean the frozen north
places not on any map

EDWARD
The Holy Land

KANE
Yes Edward I fought the Muslims
beneath the walls of Jerusalem
itself

MEREDITH
What a life you have led It must
have been so exciting

EDWARD
You think a life devoted to
violence and bloodshed is so
admirable

MEREDITH
Don’t be foolish Edward

WILLIAM
I fought in our own holy wars
under King Henry many years ago
The taking of men’s lives is hard
no matter what their faith don’t
you agree Solomon

Kane chooses his words carefully

KANE
For many yes But I confess
William I had a particular gift
for it I was never more at home
than in battle

EDWARD
Then how did you allow those
robbers to beat you so badly

MEREDITH
Edward that is rude

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett

KANE
But it is a good question
Edward I have sworn an oath
never to harm another man I
will not fight

SAMUEL
Not at all

KANE
Not at all

SAMUEL
But what if you meet more bad
men

KANE
If the Lord sees fit to put them
in my way then that is as it must
be

WILLIAM
Remember Samuel it was the Lord
who also saw fit to put us in
Captain Kane’s path

KATHERINE

Nothing happens without a reason
There is a plan for us all

EXT CAMP — NIGHT

CUT TO

A bright moon shines over the valley All seems peaceful as

the camp slumbers

WILLIAM is on watch by the dying fire He’s looking at a

map and smoking a pipe

KANE appears from out of the shadows startling William who

fumbles ineffectually for a cudgel

KANE
I’m a friend

WILLIAM
(laughing at himself)
Id be of little use if you were
not my fighting days are long
gone Could you not sleep

KANE
My dreams often disturb me

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 30

KANE (contd)

Id be happy to take watch while
you rest William

WILLIAM
No it is my task alone to watch
over my family But you’re
welcome to sit with me

Kane settles beside William They sit for a time enjoying
the flickering warmth of the nearby fire

KANE
You are blessed to have such a
family

WILLIAM

I know See

Williams takes a LOCKET from his neck and opens it for Kane
to see Inside are PORTRAITS OF KATHERINE and MEREDITH

WILLIAM
The two most beautiful women in
this world My family is
everything to me
Do you have kin

KANE
I had a brother but that was a
lifetime ago

WILLIAM
I have lost loved ones to
plague to persecution and
bigotry Edward lost his wife
and child

William falls silent in contemplation

KANE
So you sail for America

WILLIAM
We do It is a new start in a New
World I sold every possession we
had to pay for this passage You
might consider journeying with
us

Kane falls into silence for a moment

KANE
William let me be honest so you
know who you have taken in I did
not lie when I said killing was
my great gift above all others
(MORE )

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 31

KANE (contd)

My cruelty and murderous nature
were famed I am - I was - an
evil man

William studies Kane for a moment and thinks about this

WILLIAM
We have all sinned because we are
all human

KANE
But my soul is damned Satan’s
creatures will take me should I
stray from the path of peace
(a beat)
I will understand if I am no
longer welcome here

WILLIAM

You are welcome Solomon

(lightening the tone)
If only because I need a better
navigator than myself to read
this fool map I could be leading
us to Portsmouth not Plymouth for
all I know Here take a look

EXT COUNTRY SIDE WAGON TRAVELLING —- DAY 27

The FAMILY make their way along a dirt track the wagon
bouncing around as it hits ruts and potholes

KANE - his bruised face far less noticeable now - walks at
the head with the horses EDWARD as usual is driving the
cart MEREDITH sits at his side sewing some material

MEREDITH
Captain Kane

Kane drops back to see her

KANE
Miss Meredith how can I be of
service

MEREDITH

I made some clothes for you as
your others were so torn

She hands him down a dark PURITAN TUNIC SHIRT and
TROUSERS Kane is touched by this

KANE
I shall wear them with pride

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett

SAMUEL is thrashing at the undergrowth nearby with a stick

startling the horses a little

EDWARD
Hold off on that wanton
destruction Samuel

Samuel gives Edward a pointed stare and carries on

MEREDITH
Do as Edward says Samuel

SAMUEL
Why He’s not Father I don’t
have to do what he says

MEREDITH
Samuel

KANE
You know you should listen to
your elder brother Sam

Samuel halts his whipping Kane nods approvingly at the

boy much to Samuel’s delight

CUT TO

EXT ROADWAY - LATER DAY

SAMUEL walks beside KANE now matching his easy stride

WILLIAM and KATHERINE are up ahead walking hand in

Kane finishes pulling on the clothes Meredith made
dressed in their own Puritan fashion now and models
Meredith who is picking herbs and flowers nearby

KANE
Do I meet with your approval

MEREDITH
Finally you are respectable

He is
it for

He bows to her She giggles Edward is less than impressed

EDWARD
Our clothes are not for fashion
or vanity Captain Kane through
them we show our dedication to
God

With a courteous nod Kane acknowledges his understanding
of this fact Though he does share a quick smile with
Meredith - who can barely hold back a giggle - as they walk

on
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 33

EXT ROADWAY - LATER

Samuel still keeping pace with Kane

SAMUEL
Are you going to come America
with us

KANE

I don’t think so Samuel

SAMUEL
Why not

KANE
You are hoping to make a new
life I need to undo my old one

SAMUEL
Those men who hurt you you could
have beaten them if you wanted
couldn’t you

KANE
(quietly)
There was a time I’d have cut
their still-beating hearts from
their chests

Samuel is a little taken aback by this statement He takes
a moment to regroup then shrugs it off and dances around
Kane holding his stick like a sword

SAMUEL
Would you fight me

KANE
(laughing)
If you continue with your
questions I might

EDWARD
Leave Captain Kane alone

Samuel pokes Kane with his stick
SAMUEL
Don’t tell me what to do Edward
(to Kane)
Fight me

Pokes Kane again

KANE
I have no cause to fight you

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 34

Samuel makes a sudden dash to grab Meredith She screams
half annoyed half playful

MEREDITH
Samuel stop it

SAMUEL
Now you have a reason To save
this beautiful maiden from me

MEREDITH
(playing along)
Oh Solomon Save me Help

EDWARD
Stop you’ll scare the horses

Joining into the spirit of it all Kane swipes up a stick
from the side of the road Jokingly he parries Samuel’s
thrust

SAMUEL
I knew it I knew you would fight
if you had to

Meredith laughs and even Edward manages a gentle smile at
this

KANE
You’re quite a foe Samuel but
Ill fight to save this beauty

WILLIAM and KATHERINE watch contentedly
Then the wagon come around a corner to a VILLAGE to find
--BODIES lying twisted in the middle of the road The tiny

VILLAGE beyond IS IN RUINS - many of the houses still
burning others just blackened frames

EXT DESTROYED VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER 30

KANE WILLIAM and EDWARD are looking at DOZENS OF CORPSES
scattered around the village CROWS line the trees nearby
waiting to move in The air of death and menace hangs
heavy

A little way back MEREDITH KATHERINE and SAMUEL wait
uneasily

EDWARD
Who could have done this

Kane studies the bodies Men women and children are
twisted in agonized forms
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 35

Some seem to have been burned skin peeled away ALL THEIR
EYES ARE BURNED FROM THEIR SKULLS leaving hollow empty
sockets

WILLIAM
The Devil has been here

Edward drops to his knees and starts to pray

EDWARD
Holy Father

Katherine Meredith and Samuel press near

KANE
Keep back

Kane looks around

KANE
Not the Devila witch

There is a pyre in the centre of the village square with a
stake in the centre It has been partly consumed by flames

KANE
There was a witch burning here
but the creature broke free

William turns over a horribly disfigured body It is a man
dressed in the classic dark clothes of a WITCHFINDER the
charred remnants of a bible are in his hand

WILLIAM
Dear Lord this is the
witchfinder general If he is
dead

KANE
We must go

EDWARD
We can’t just leave these people
for carrion

KANE
There’s nothing we can do for
them

Kane holds William’s steady gaze

WILLIAM
We must bury them as Christians

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 36

EXT VILLAGE - LATER 31

KANE sweating and filthy is finishing digging a shallow
grave as EDWARD and WILLIAM lower a body into another
nearby There are a handful of others graves dotted about
each with a wooden cross marking it

KATHERINE is making the wooden crosses nearby

SAMUEL watches uneasily from the wagon in the distance
whilst everyone else is involved in the unsavory task

Kane eyes the setting sun nervously MEREDITH approaches
over the rough ground and offers him a cup of water He
drinks thirstily

KANE
Thank you

She looks at him for a moment and he catches her gaze

MEREDITH
Youryour wounds are healing
well

KANE
I never thanked you for your
care

MEREDITH

There is no need to thank me
Now both stand amongst the graves unsure what to say next
KATHERINE 0S
I need more wood for these

crosses

CUT TO

EXT VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER 32

MEREDITH is AT THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE SQUARE now
gathering up pieces of wood for the crosses As she
reaches for some she notices TWO BODIES nearby

The BODY OF A WOMAN TWITCHES with some slight movement
Meredith makes to shout out to her brother and father who
are carrying another corpse to the graves some yards away

but then the body moves again

She approaches the corpse Inch by inch reaching out a hand
to turn the corpse over

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 37

-»a YOUNG GIRL no more than 8 years old is clinging to
the body of her mother This blood stained and ragged
child stares up at Meredith with terrified eyes and
unleashes a TERRIFIED SCREAM that echoes across the whole
village

CUT TO

EXT CAMP — EVENING 33

The CHILD sits between MEREDITH and KATHERINE wrapped in a
blanket and drinking some warm broth The rest of the
family are sitting around the FIRE KANE is a little way
off nervously watching the gathering darkness

KATHERINE
Can you tell us what happened
child

It takes a moment for the child to find her voice When she
does it is so soft as to be barely audible but the terrible
story is clear enough

GIRL
(quietly)
The grown-ups said there was a
witch in the woods She’d been
taking cattle and children My
brother died

Meredith comforts the girl as she draws breath to continue
haltingly

GIRL (CONT)
-They called that man the
Witchfinder He said that the
witches and devils were growing
more powerful than ever before
That something had happened to
give them strength But still he
trapped the witch and sentenced
her to be burned at the stake
They all came to watch her die in

the fire but when they set the
flames It didn’t hurt her She
laughed and said she said that

a great sorcerer had opened the
gate to Hell and that all the

devils children were free And
thenthen she killed them all

Only the crackle of the wood on the fire breaks the silence
now
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 38

EDWARD
(quietly)
We should pray

The family bow their heads Kane doesn’t He watches the
girl

GIRL
I’m tired

KATHERINE
Just a moment more

GIRL
(suddenly angry)
I don’t want to
(soft again)
I’m so tired please

MEREDITH
Of course you are you poor
thing Let’s find a place for you
to sleep

As Meredith helps the girl to her feet Kane stalks over

KANE
Edward I think the child should
have your cross for protection
tonight Would you mind

The child watches Kane

EDWARD
Of course not - here

He hands Kane the silver CROSS from around his own neck
Kane takes it and slowly approaches the girl He kneels
before her

KANE
If you wear this it will help
keep you safe tonight

The girls eyes the silver cross as it catches the red
firelight

GIRL
I don’t want to

MEREDITH
It will help

GIRL
No

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 39

KANE
Just let me
(reaching for her)
--put it around you neck

GIRL
No

MEREDITH
Solomon stop it Can’t you see
she’s frightened

Suddenly Kane lunges for her violently He grabs her

MEREDITH
Solomon no

-and press the crucifix into the child’s flesh

Instantly the CHILD SCREAMS as the METAL BURNS HER SKIN
She starts to howl and snarl in Kane’s arms

WILLIAM
Dear god what have you done

KANE
This is her This is the witch

The LITTLE GIRL NOW HAS TRANSFORMED in Kane’s arms A foul
ancient and yet ferocious looking creature with a twisted
snarling face sharp teeth and long nails that tear at him
She is so strong he cannot hold her

WITCH
Solomon Kane Solomon Kane Your
Master awaits his pleasure with
you I’1ll be there too in the
Pit The gates of hell are open
for you Kane

And suddenly she tears herself from Kane’s arms and FLIES
INTO THE AIR and away into the night

They can hear her cackling screaming laughter echo into
the distance

EXT ROADWAY - DAWN 34

KANE and the FAMILY are travelling in silence along the
rutted back roads of southern England They have clearly
been travelling all night and are exhausted

As they approach a fork in the dirt road they hear the
sound of many voices approaching
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 40

SUDDENLY A DOZEN or so PEASANTS appear from around a bend
in the road ahead Some are bloody and beaten - it is clear
they are DESPERATE REFUGEES of some kind

William tries to talk to the first few but they pass him
without stopping

WILLIAM
What is wrong Tell me

Finally a PRIEST rushes by

WILLIAM
Tell me what has happened Is it
the witch

PRIEST
A witch I wish it was No these
are Raiders Dear God such
terrible cruel men
Join them or perish they said
When we fought back but it was a
massacre Dear Lordthey seem
possessed of some terrible evil
Turn back while you can or
they’1l have you for their
slaves

He pushes William aside and rushes on with the tide of
refugees

MEREDITH
What will we do

EDWARD
We must turn back

SAMUEL
No

WILLIAM
This is the only road to Plymouth
- how else will we make the ship
We must go on find another way

MEREDITH
Please Father

WILLIAM
Our future is in the New World

KANE
William you must not continue
Cant you feel it There is
something evil gathering in the
west Go back
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 41

WILLIAM
There’s nothing for us to go back
to Our only way is ahead to get
to the ship Can you help me

KANE takes a MAP from the saddle of one of the horses He
studies it for a moment

KANE
Then this road
(showing the map)
it takes us south through
these forests and we can finda
way west again here

EDWARD
How can you be sure We should
turn back Father Perhaps wait a

time

MEREDITH
Edwards right It’s too
dangerous

KANE

Trust me I can lead you

KATHERINE
You can get us through

you to your vessel

EXT FOREST EDGE - LATER DAY 35
Alone now in the empty countryside the wagon passes out of
the open landscape and into the forest

EXT FOREST - DAY 36

Deep shadows under the thick canopy Strange noises echo
through the trees but there is no signs of life

EDWARD
Are you sure this is the safest
way
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 42

KANE
There is no safe way but if these
raiders are taking slaves and
looting villages they’1ll hunt in
the populated areas north of
here We may slip past them
unseen But these forests are not
without their dangers Be wary

SAMUEL
What kind of dangers

KATHERINE
Captain Kane means animals and
suchlike Now quiet

The cart and horses rattles along slowly The passengers
looking nervously about them

They enter an open glade in the forest Before them are
SOME RUINS half overgrown by the forest

KANE
Well make camp here

KANE

him The SOUND OF RAIN is loud on the canvas

SAMUEL

KANE
What’s the matter

SAMUEL
I heard something in the trees

Immediately Kane is up and heading out the tent

KANE
Wait here

EXT FOREST EDGE OF CAMP —- MOMENTS LATER 40

Dawn mist hangs amongst the trees Branches drip water as
the RAIN hammers down through the foliage

KANE stalks through the undergrowth until he sees MOVEMENT
through the trees on the other side of a small RIVER

A SUDDEN SOUND behind him makes him turn sharply It’s
just SAMUEL trying to keep up Kane urgently waves him
away but the young man is determined to be with Kane

KANE
(hissing)
Be silent Samuel this is no
game

Together they advance until they see more clearly

a PARTY OF MARAUDERS ON HORSEBACK They are a grotesque
bunch with scarred and twisted faces All have an ARCANE
MAGICAL INSIGNIA on their torn and shredded leathers and
rough chain mail Some even have it branded into their
flesh

SAMUEL
What are they Solomon

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 44

KANE

They must be the Raiders we heard
of

(hushed urgent)
Listen to me Go back to the
camp quietly wake them and tell

WILLIAM and EDWARD are already bloody and beaten MEREDITH
fights like a wild cat but she is punched and thrown to the

Branches whip against him thorns cutting rain pouring
down but he ignores it all

CUT TO

EXT PURITAN CAMP —- CONT 47

The RAIDERS are destroying the camp Setting fire to
possessions taking the horses for their own

Watching it all is the OVERLORD He takes no part in these
activities but sits motionless on a MASSIVE BLACK HORSE
The Overlord is a HUGE FIGURE ENCASED IN LEATHER ARMOUR
his face entirely covered by a grotesque MASK huge sword
hanging at his waist It’s almost as if he is directing his
men silently simply by sheer force of will

MEREDITH is struggling against her CAPTORS She hits him
but he throws her to the ground Crouching over her he
tears at her clothes his intentions clear

WILLIAM and KATHERINE watch in horror SAMUEL scrambles to
them

WILLIAM
Leave her Please

EDWARD struggles free from his captor and rises to her
defence

EDWARD
Take your hands off her

He hits the attacker with all his strength but it makes no
difference Another raider beats Edward to the ground

KANE OS
No
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 46

The RAIDERS turn at this new voice Many hands on the hilts
of vicious SWORDS but there is just one man there

KANE is standing at the edge of the clearing breathless
and desperate

KANE
Stop

The OVERLORD seems to be watching this newcomer intently
He looks to one of this raiders the one with the EYE-
PATCH and nods slowly

EYE-PATCH strides forward snatching Samuel away from his
mother and dragging him along as he advances on Kane He

takes a huge serrated knife from his belt and presses it
to the boys’ throat

The OVERLORD watches all this calmly

Kane prepares himself as the Raider stops a few yards in
front of him

KANE
I am unarmed

Wiping the rain from his face Kane sizes up the raider
He’s desperately trying to work out how to diffuse the
situation

KANE
These people Listen to me
these people they’re good
people Christians Devout
people They’re no threat

SAMUEL
Kill him Solomon Kill them all

WILLIAM
No Samuel Solomon don’t

Samuel struggles against his captor Fighting furiously
The other raiders are advancing slowly on Kane

KANE

Samuel don’t struggle He’1l let
you go if you don’t do anything

(to Eye-Patch)
Won’t you They have no money
What else can they give you

(a sudden thought)
You want slaves Take me I’m
strong better than these people
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 47

SAMUEL
I know you can do it Solomon
Kill him Cut his heart out

KANE
Samuel silence

Kane’s eyes flick over to the silent OVERLORD waiting
nearby The figure raises his arm and clenches his fist
and then suddenly

The Eye-Patch Raider starts to shake and jerk as if
something is moving within him His single eye turns as
black as congealed blood

The VOICE that comes from Eye-Patch is a rumbling growl
that fills the forest A little BLOOD DRIBBLES FROM HIS
MOUTH as he speaks

EYE-PATCH
Kill me can you

KANE
NoI am a man of peace I offer
no resistance Take me Do not
harm them

EYE-PATCH
(shaking the boy)
This boy this child has

more heart than any of you He’s
the only man here

KANE
(placating)
Listen to me

Eye-Patch shifts his grip on the knife

KANE
No

Eye-Patch looks down at SAMUEL’S DEAD BODY and laughs

EYE-PATCH
This was the only man here

Take the girl Kill the rest

Meredith is snatched away Others grab Katherine try to
tear her away from William

MEREDITH

Almost in a trance Kane takes a step towards Eye-Patch

Kane is transforming before our eyes The steel is
returning

The RAGE

Come no nearer Puritan

Eye-Patch watches him his black eye burning intensely
Kane calls to Katherine and William

KANE
Would you have me slaughter these
men Can that be justice enough

KATHERINE
Kill them Kill them all

KANE
(he turns his head up to
heaven quietly)
Is that what you want Is that
all I am to you a killer

Eye-Patch stands ready for anything now from this strange
predatory man as Kane focuses all his intensity on him

KANE
If I take your life I am bound
for hell

It is a price I will gladly pay
Eye-Patch charges Kane swinging his sword

side takes the brute’s arm and SNAPS IT IN HALF

He yanks away the sword reverses it DRIVES THE BLADE TO
THE HILT INTO THE MAN’S BODY slicing upwards and GUTTING
HIM

No human blood spills from these possessed soldiers only a
SLUDGE OF BLACK BILE AND RED SAND Kane doesn’t miss a
moment to consider the evil at work here

KANE turns savagely on the others who are rushing towards
him now

The MASKED OVERLORD sits impassively watching it all
The RAIDERS have no chance as they attack Kane

For every SWORD thrust at him he replies with a DEADLY BLOW
of his own

PISTOLS are fired but bullets go astray

It seems as if Kane is ten men so consumed with his
murderous rage His feral howls of combat fills the air

Some of the Raiders are more cowardly They mount their
horses and ride for safety

One of them hauls MEREDITH onto his mount EDWARD grabs her
but the Raider takes a pistol from his belt and SHOOTS
EDWARD IN THE HEAD

WILLIAM struggles with another two raiders but is cut down
and stabbed by them KATHERINE rushes to his side

Kane delivers one killing blow after another LIMBS ARE
SLICED HEADS SEVERED

Kane is desperately fighting his way towards Meredith
before she’s taken away but he simply can’t get through in
time

KATHERINE
Solomon Solomon Don’t let them
take her

But he cannot reach her The OVERLORD wheels his steed
about and leads his surviving raiders away through the
trees even as Kane races on foot in pursuit

EXT FOREST PATH - CONT 48
KANE dashes after them but no matter how swiftly he runs

the horses vanish into the distance ahead and loses sight
of them in the mist and drizzle

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 50

In fury he turns and races back to the forest clearing

CUT TO

EXT FOREST CAMP — MOMENTS LATER 49

In thunderous silence KANE stalks through the devastated
camp The BODIES OF THE RAIDERS are all around He picks
through their corpses and clothing seeking information He
tears the INSIGNIA from the uniform of a dying Raider As
the creature draws its last breath it seems to CHANGE BACK
INTO NOTHING MORE THAN A ROUGH LOOKING MAN All the bestial
elements melt away with the rain

Kane considers this for a moment and then moves on He
steps past the bodies of EDWARD and SAMUEL as walks towards
WILLIAM and KATHERINE

KATHERINE is cradling the dying WILLIAM in her arms He has
been mortally stabbed his breath coming in short bloody
bursts He looks to Kane

WILLIAM
Get her back

William speaks urgently fighting for every breath

KANE
I will

WILLIAM
Swear this oath to me now Kane

William grabs Kane and draws him near

WILLIAM
By your own word you are a
butcher and a murderer you know
how to kill like no man born Do
it For me for my family Kill
them all

KANE
My soul

WILLIAM
This is how you will redeem your
soul Find my child and end this
evil

The dying man holds Kane’s eyes with the last fire of his
own

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 51

WILLIAM
Swear your oath Swear to God
Almighty and He will protect your
soul Do it

Kane looks to Katherine she want to hear it too He takes
William’s hand in his own

KANE
I swear I will find her and I
will destroy this evil

William makes no show of having heard this HE IS DEAD

Katherine cradles Williams body as Kane gently takes the
locket from around William’s neck He checks that the
PICTURE OF MEREDITH is still within and then turns away

As THUNDER RUMBLES through the forest Kane snatches up a
few essentials - SWORDS KNIVES a BRACE OF PISTOLS AND

POWDER along with some provisions Then he pulls a long
black Puritan cloak about him and dons a wide brim black
hat

This is SOLOMON KANE the Puritan avenger armed to the
teeth and ready for the hunt in all his glory

He takes the reins of a dead raider’s horse swings himself
up and charges away and into the trees

CUT TO

INT TREES - MOMENTS LATER 50
KANE is GALLOPING along the forest path Ducking under
branches and jumping fallen trees His hat flies off but

he makes no effort to retrieve it

The DRIVING RAIN makes the ground treacherous and

visibility poor but still Kane pushes the horse as fast as
it can go

Up ahead he sees the faintest glimpse of the dark riders
fleeing

Impossibly he forces his steed even faster

-- and gains on them

ON THE RIDERS UP AHEAD

The group of FIVE RIDERS are pushing their own horses hard

One of them has MEREDITH bundled and covered across his
saddle

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 52

Their LEADER sees KANE in the distance and indicates for
two riders to split away and deal with him

ON KANE

The TWO RIDERS appear parallel to him now one on either
side Trees whipping past between them

They draw their swords and start to close in

Kane waits for them to attack

Then still at full gallop Kane takes his hands off the
reigns and pulls out BOTH PISTOLS from his belt Arms
outstretched he levels a gun at each attacker and pulls
the triggers simultaneously

BOTH RIDERS crash from their horses

Without a second glance Kane rides on

CUT TO

EXT OPEN COUNTRY - CONT 51

The remaining riders BURST from the forest edge into open
scrubby ground Just the three of them left now but still
pushing their horses hard

MOMENTS LATER KANE charges from the trees Riding like
the devil himself and making ground on his quarry

ON THE RAIDERS

Knowing that Kane is going to catch them they split up but
unerringly he follows the one carrying Meredith

CUT TO

EXT STONE CIRCLE - MOMENTS LATER 52

The RAIDER still clutching the GIRL bundled up across his
horse gallops through the broken remains of a STONE CIRCLE
on these open moors He turns and sees KANE closing the gap
second by second

There is no escape now Within the stone circle he wheels
his horse to a halt and turns to face Kane The horse is
exhausted foaming at the mouth breath coming in great
steaming clouds

Kane keeps coming until he’s at the perimeter of the
stones He circles beyond the stones
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 53

KANE
Give me the girl Give me the
girl

The Raider drops the bundled up girl to the ground She
lies there stunned and exhausted

Kane dismounts and runs to her

KANE
Meredith
(to the Raider)
If she is harmed

He turns her overIT IS NOT MEREDITH

just a YOUNG DARK-HAIRED GIRL Weak and fearful She
recoils from Kane

Kane GRABS THE RAIDER and drags him down from his horse

KANE
Where is she

The Raider tries to fight but he can do nothing against
Kane who beats him viciously

RAIDER
There You have her

KANE
It is not her Where is she The
girl you took from our camp
Meredith

RAIDER
I don’t know I don’t know
Perhaps others have her There
are raiding parties all over

Kane draws his knife and presses it into the Raider’s flesh
beneath his eyeball

KANE
Tell me what you know or I will
pluck your eyes from your skull
where will they take her Who is
your master

Kane presses the knife into his flesh Black blood trickles
down his face

He screams in agony but then the SCREAM BECOMES A LAUGH
the Raider suddenly begins TO SHAKE AND TWIST His

already scared and feral face contorts into a snarl his
eyes become black as old blood
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 54

He stares at Kane and laughs A hideous cackle that echoes
around the broken stones The Raider’s voice changes as if
he’s suddenly possessed by an altogether more malicious
spirit It is a feral growl filled with malice and though
it comes from the mouth of the raider it seems to resonate
all around them

RAIDER
Solomon Kane You may carve the
flesh of this worthless body but
it will not tell you what you
want to know I will not let it

Blood drips from the Raider’s mouth even as he laughs at
Kane

The GIRL watches from her place on the ground nearby
horrified

Kane shakes the possessed Raider

KANE
What in God’s name are you

RAIDER
I am nothing in that God’s name
I am a servant of the shadows My
master released us from the pit
and these human bodies are enough
for our needs

Then Kane sees on the crest of a distant hill the
OVERLORD watching silently

The bloodied raider before him speaks

RAIDER
Do you believe that your
salvation lies in saving this
single girl

KANE
I will find her

RAIDER
You will fail slayer of
innocents murderer
killer of your own brother

KANE
I will hunt you down and send
your black heart to your master
in Hell

RAIDER
I have no heart Nor do you
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 55

Kane shakes the body smashes his fist into it beating it
relentlessly now

RAIDER
My Master sends his greetings
from The Pit He is waiting for
you

The Masked Rider on the hill turns away

As he does so the puppet body of the Raider shakes and
twisted by one final hideous convulsion Blood pours from
his mouth nose and eyes and after a single agonized scream
it slumps forwards And then little by little the
Raider’s face changes to that of a normal young man The
black blood becomes red once again and he lies still

Kane rises slowly unsure as to his plan Then he hears a
muffled sob from the girl

He goes over to her and gently helps her to sit up

KANE
You are safe child The beast is
gone

GIRL

What was that thing
He wraps her in his own cloak

KANE
It’s just a man again now but
there was a demon within him
Are you injured

GIRL
No
(a beat)
Thank you for saving me

She climbs unsteadily to her feet Kane watches not sure
what to do

KANE
I’m Solomon Kane what is your
name

GIRL
Elizabeth

KANE
You should rest now Elizabeth

ELIZABETH
I want to go home

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 56

Kane takes her gently by the shoulder

KANE
Child they leave none alive
There will be no home for you to
return to

She falls silent and then gently begins to cry This young
woman is really little more than a girl Kane is at a loss
know how to comfort her

CUT TO

EXT STONE CIRCLE CAMP —- LATER 53

KANE has set a small camp fire going and is cooking up some
simple food over the flame Elizabeth sits nearby with
Kane’s cloak around her

ELIZABETH
You risk your life for your love

KANE
My love

ELIZABETH
This girl Meredith that you
seek you must love her very
much

KANE
No She is I made a promise
That is all

ELIZABETH
I didn’t mean to intrude

He waves her apology away and sets about preparing the
camp

KANE
Tell me what you know of this
evil

ELIZABETH
My fathermy father said the

Raiders were from the west -
Cornwall perhaps or Devonshire
He said there is a sorcerer
raising an army of these Raiders
to take over the land That
masked man he is their general -
a demon in a man’s body they say
who can control the soldiers with
his mind alone

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 57

ELIZABETH (contd)
They burn and butcher at will and

more are joining them all the
time How can anyone fight this

KANE
(quietly)
I can

MIX TO

EXT STONE CIRCLE CAMP —- LATER DAY 54

Mist hangs in the air around their tiny camp The two
horses graze placidly nearby

Kane adds a little more wood to the small camp FIRE
ELIZABETH is asleep huddled before the flames He watches
her for a moment clearly a little conflicted over
something

Then quietly he GATHERS HIS WEAPONS checks them and
straps them to his horse

He takes all the food clothing and other useful items and
leaves them by the fire next to the girl He takes a
PISTOL and POWDER and rests those near to her too

After another moment of silent thought he walks back to his
horse and mounts

The noise wakes ELIZABETH

ELIZABETH
What are you doing

KANE
Ive left you all the provisions
I have Do you know how to use a
pistol

She scrambles to her feet

ELIZABETH
Why You’re leaving me No

KANE
Elizabeth you cannot come where
I am going There’s danger ahead
and When you have rested
take that horse and head east
Find a church Beg sanctuary

ELIZABETH
Please don’t leave me Please I
have nothing left Please

Kane is torn between duties but he has no choice

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 58

KANE
I am sorry Elizabeth I have to
go May God protect you

He drives his heels into his horse and gallops away into
the mist

CUT TO

EXT ROAD OUTSIDE VILLAGE - DAY 55

The RAIDERS and their WAGON TRAIN have come to a halt
outside a small village on the edge of a dark forest

It is just one of several wagons joining together to form a
longer train A rough platoon of Raiders walks or rides
alongside It may be an army of sorts but it is crude and
undisciplined

We see now that there are DIFFERENT CASTES OF RAIDERS some
are little more than rough looking men whilst others
clearly of higher rank are far more corrupted and changed
Seemingly the longer they have been fighting the more
strongly the possession takes hold

MEREDITH is lying on her side at the bottom of a CAGE
mounted on the back of a wagon She is freezing cold
shivering and filthy There is a DEAD BODY right beside
her in the overpacked wagon She is praying quietly
intensely

MEREDITH
Heavenly Father I beseech you to
save us from this evil
(to a companion)
Pray with me Pray for us all

CAPTIVE
Slavery or sacrifice there is
nothing else for us

MEREDITH
Don’t give up We will find the
strength to survive this
In the name of the Father Son
and the Holy Ghost

One of the RAIDERS walking near Meredith’s wagon slams the
flat of his sword against the cage

RAIDER
Quiet
(to his companions )
Clear out the dead
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 59

MEREDITH shrinks back from the front of the cage as the
savage raiders fling open the door and DRAG OUT THE BODIES
They are DUMPED by the side of the road

CUT TO
EXT VILLAGE - CONT

A DOZEN MEN OF THE VILLAGE are lined up on their knees
before the OVERLORD RAIDERS are gathered around

Other VILLAGERS are watching from a huddled group nearby
They have the grim resolution of a beaten community as the
Raiders take food and water as they please

On GIBBETS by the side of the road a DOZEN MEN ARE HANGING
BY THEIR NECKS

VILLAGER
Don’t join them Don’t do it

YOUTH
Father Don’t

One of the MEN on his knees in the line turns to the crowd

MAN
What choice is there We must
join them or perish

The OVERLORD stands before this man Two Raiders at his
shoulder speak for him in strange synchronization

RAIDERS OVERLORD
Will you serve the Master

MAN
Yyes

The Overlord takes hold of the villager’s head between his
huge hands The man SCREAMS for a moment but then begins to
change

- rippling from the Overlord’s fingers are creeping
tendrils that distort and alter his skin like a FOUL
DISEASE overwhelming the human side of him When the
transformation is complete he has the same vacant
corrupted look as the other Raiders

RAIDEROVERLORD
Brand him And these others

Another Raider draws a burning brand from a nearby fire and
presses into the new Raider’s flesh He seems to barely
even notice

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 60

A YOUNG MAN - no more than 15 - charges towards the
Overlord He has a short sword raised ready to strike the
Overlord

YOUTH
Father

With stunning speed the Overlord draws his massive
broadsword In one sweeping motion he SLICES THE BOY in
half

The BOY’S FATHER looks down at the body with no emotion

CUT TO

EXT FIELDS - SUNSET 56

KANE rides along what passes for a road but is little more
than a muddy track He’s bundled up against the cold cloak
wrapped tightly around

He slows a little when HE COMES TO A CROSSROADS and checks
his direction on a COMPASS The needle spins crazily no
matter how he holds it

Ahead of him he sees PEOPLE coming down the road A CROWD
OF RAGGED REFUGEES fleeing whatever evil is beyond They
are hollowed eyed and road weary and not all peasants Some
are clad in finer clothes but all are escaping the terror

KANE
Greetings friends

No one speaks They just hurry past him

Kane drops from his horse and approaches a MAN and his
FAMILY He takes the locket from his neck opens it and
shows the picture to the refugees

KANE
This girl have you seen her
You Any of you

They don’t care Won’t look Others just flow by Kane
tries to show them all but no one cares

KANE
Stop damn you Look at it Look

WOMAN
If she was taken there is no
hope

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 61

KANE
I am hunting those who did this
to you I need to know where they
are

MAN
They are everywhere Ghouls
creatures and demons are abroad
Every foul thing of the earth has
come No one can fight them

WOMAN
Pray for your friend it is all
you can do now

CUT TO

EXT ROADS - LATER EVENING 57

There is a shallow FORD that bisects the road KANE
dismounts and leads his horse over to it He allows it to
drink before scooping up a few handfuls of water himself
and refilling his water bottles

Then he sees a PILE OF ROTTING BODIES dumped at the side of
the road Some of the corpses have spilled into the water
Kane spits out the water and empties his bottles again

KANE
(pulling the horse away)
Stop Don’t drink it’s befouled
Can you not taste it animal

As he pulls the reluctant horse away he notices there are
SEVERAL PEASANTS standing silent and ghostlike in the
hedges and undergrowth nearby

KANE
I’m looking for this girl

There is something wrong with these people It seems as
though their humanity has been stripped away revealing
something feral and terrifying beneath

Little by little they begin advancing on him with silent
menace Some have pitchforks others have axes and others
have nothing more than their clawed hands

KANE DRAWS HIS SWORD and spins to try and keep track of
them all

KANE
Stay back

His horse bucks and pulls against the reins as Kane
struggles to get into a position to remount

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 62

KANE
Steady woah

But the HORSE BREAKS FREE of him knocking him over and
in a panic the animal runs away TRAMPLING OVER a pair of
the advancing PEASANTS

Kane scrambles to his feet and with nothing but his single
SWORD and a PISTOL in his belt readies himself against the
ATTACKERS as they silently close the circle now

The first of the PEASANTS let’s loose a terrible scream and
CHARGES AT HIM Kane is ready

Dropping to his knees he sweeps his blade across his
attacker’s legs SEVERING THEM AT THE KNEE The victim
makes no sound and shows no pain He simply drops to the
floor and even with hideous injuries continues to struggle
on

Kane then turns on the others and with brutal efficiency
sets about their destruction

CUT TO

EXT WAGON TRAIN —- NIGHT 58

By the light of burning brands the RAIDER’S WAGONS crawl
relentlessly across the countryside towards some unknown
destination

The CAPTIVES are huddled together Dead and dying along
with the silent terrified living

RAIDER
Clear out the bodies

The wasted bodies of the fallen are roughly dragged out of
the wagons and dumped carelessly at the side of the road

MEREDITH is amongst the dead

CUT TO

EXT COUNTRYSIDE —- NIGHT 59

KANE walks now He is bloodied and weary and has lost
virtually everything but for his sword his pistol and the
clothes on his back and yet still he strides on
relentlessly Determination written in every line of his
face

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 63

Up ahead on the crest of a hill he sees a BEACON lighting
the tower of a BROKEN DOWN CHURCH offering sanctuary for
the night

CUT TO

EXT ROADSIDE VERGE - NIGHT 60
The only noise in this still and misty night is the rattle
of the carts and breathing of the horses as they fade away
into the night

ON A PILE OF CORPSES

Just a mound of tattered flesh and corpses with MEREDITH
lying amongst them

CLOSING IN ON HER FACE
Serene and still But then
HER EYES SNAP OPEN

Barely daring to breathe she looks around Desperately
nervous she looks around for danger

It seems she is alone but for the dead

Initially tentative and full of fear she begins to scrabble
out from the corpse midden The more she struggles the
more revolted and desperate she becomes

-Until finally she’s screaming as she tears and pulls at
the bodies to get herself free

CUT TO

EXT DERELICT CHURCH YARD - NIGHT 61

KANE passes through the WOODEN ARCHED ENTRANCE of the
church yard The light of the beacon still flickers in the
crumbling bell tower of the ancient Saxon church An
ECHOING SCREAM carries across the dark countryside
something evil in the distance Kane hurries towards the
church

GRAVESTONES have been flattened or shattered There are a
COUPLE OF BODIES hanging from a tree in the distance This
place has a real sense of death and decay Strange noises
echo across the countryside

He cautiously approaches the door and pushes it open

CUT TO

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 64

INT DERELICT CHURCH -— EVENING 62

Kane’s feet crunch loudly on the broken masonry that
litters the floor

The roof has collapsed in places exposing the night sky
Pews are scattered and broken even the altar is
overturned

Startled BIRDS disturbed in their nighttime roost
suddenly explode out of the rafters

SOMETHING IS WATCHING KANE as he explores this desecrated
sanctuary

As Kane approaches the altar and THE WATCHER COMES NEARER
stalking him from the shadows

Kane bends to his knees and bows his head before the fallen
idol

The ATTACKER makes its final approach a wooden club
raised ready to bring down on Kane

But KANE WHIRLS ROUND AT THE LAST MOMENT and points his
pistol right into the face of

- a PRIEST
The two are frozen for a moment This priest is wild-eyed
and at the end of his strength Even if he did strike Kane
it would barely register
Kane slowly lowers his pistol He raises empty hands
KANE
You are in no danger from me
Father
The Priest quivers in fear the cudgel still ready
KANE
I wished only for a little refuge
and a moment for prayer
Slowly the Priest lowers his own weapon
PRIEST
Ffforgive me I have seen

such things

CUT TO

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 65

EXT FIELDS - NIGHT 63

Under the light of the full moon MEREDITH runs headlong
through the night

She stumbles and falls tripping down a precipitous slope
and splashing into A NARROW RIVER

She forces her way across to the other side But now
exhaustion is catching her and as she struggles up the
other side she slides back down the mud bank and into the
waters

Her freezing fingers claw their way up the muddy banks
again but she can hardly make any progress she’s so tired
and cold

But A HAND REACHES FROM THE DARKNESS AND GRABS HERS

A TEENAGE BOY THOMAS WOOLMAN is helping her over the top
To Meredith in her dazed and exhausted state he looks
just like SAMUEL

MEREDITH
Samuel Am I dead

BOY
You ain’t dead miss But we may
be if we wait around here much
longer There’s terrible things
in the dark

THOMAS helps Meredith to her feet She can hardly stand but
he puts his arms around her and holds her steady

MEREDITH
Do you know a place I can
shelter

CUT TO

INT DERELICT CHURCH - NIGHT 64

Kane and the Priest - FATHER MICHAEL a gaunt wild haired
man clearly hovering on the brink of sanity and still clad
in a torn tunic with stained dog-collar - are eating simple
fare around a fire that burns in the corner of the church

FATHER MICHAEL
Have you come far

KANE
Aye Two days’ hard ride brought
me here but where here is I do
not know
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett

FATHER MICHAEL
The borderlands of Somerset and
Devonshire

KANE
(quietly)
My homeland

FATHER MICHAEL
What

KANE
I lived in Axmouth Castle as a
boy It’s not so far from here

FATHER MICHAEL
A sad homecoming for you

KANE
What happened here Did the
raiders come

FATHER MICHAEL
Every foul thing that the light
of Christ kept at bay is
returning We have burned so many
witches and their familiars but
still they keep coming One of
them cursed my flock with her
evil turning them into terrible
ghoulish creatures

KANE
I met some on the road before
Flesh and blood but no longer
human

FATHER MICHAEL
Did you hurt them

KANE
I had no choice

FATHER MICHAEL
They are innocent of their
crimes I have watched men become
monsters before my eyes They
slaughter each other fathers
killing their children brother
murdering brother Such a hunger
is in them
This is truly the end of days

KANE
Do you believe that

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 67

FATHER MICHAEL
I believe that God is testing my
faith

KANE
By cursing us all Christ and all
his Angels are asleep whilst we
suffer

FATHER MICHAEL
Mind your blasphemy It’s as God
wants it He wants to feel our
love for him even through our
agony

Kane gets to his feet and paces angrily

KANE
Feel our love How can it be
right that this evil is walking
amongst us pouring its poison
into the land when all we have
to protect us iswhat Faith
Where are the warriors who will
take the fight to them Why don’t
they walk amongst us just as the
foul creatures do Tell me
Priest who in the world can
fight this Evil

Kane is caught in a shaft of moonlight which splinters
through the broken roof Sword in hand pistol in his belt
and anger written across his face the answer to
Kane’s own question is obvious to the priest even if it is
not to Kane himself

Kane hears a movement and is suddenly alert

KANE
There is something out there

FATHER MICHAEL
No son there is nothing evil out
there

Kane prepares himself for a fight

FATHER MICHAEL
The evil is here already

Kane turns to him confused by this

KANE
What do you mean
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 68

The Priest limps over to a trap door in the floor of the
church He reaches to the handle and lifts it Kane picks
up a burning brand and approaches

FATHER MICHAEL
See

For a moment Kane stares into the BLACKNESS BELOW and sees
nothing and SUDDENLY a DOZEN PALE FACES appear luminous
evil eyes snarling and grasping for him but they can’t get
out of the cellar

KANE
My God

Father Michael giggles a little It’s an uneasy slightly
insane laugh

FATHER MICHAEL
What was I to do They were men
and women once People I knew

KANE
Destroy them man

FATHER MICHAEL
I cannot destroy them I am their
shepherd This is my test of
faith to love even the foulest
creatures

The CREATURES in the cellar are silent but watch Kane with
terrible menace and hunger They have sharp bloody teeth
their hair is thinning and falling out in clumps their
skin white and waxen

KANE
Not any more They are changed
they are creatures of darkness
now I have seen the like before
in my travels Vampires or undead
ghouls of some formYou
cannot

FATHER MICHAEL
No They are my flock and I have
a duty of care towards them I
keep them I care for them
I feed them

Kane is horrified

KANE
Feed them What do they eat

THE PRIEST SUDDENLY RUSHES AT KANE and SHOVES HIM BACKWARDS
towards the OPEN TRAP DOOR

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 69

FATHER MICHAEL
Flesh

Kane taken by surprise stumbles and teeters on the edge
of the open hatchway and it seems that he might just
keep his footing until

--with a bloodcurdling cry one of the ghouls leaps up and
grabs his leg yanking him backwards

Kane TUMBLES BACK DOWN INTO THE PIT

The Priest dashes forward and slams the cellar door closed
on the snarling screeching pack of ghouls

FATHER MICHAEL
May God have mercy on your soul

CUT TO

INT CHURCH CELLAR —- CONT 65

As soon as KANE TUMBLES INTO THE DARK the GHOULS attack
him Their mouths open baring razor edged teeth

The BURNING TORCH has fallen into the pit with him its
flickering light illuminating the dark space

Kane cries in anger and pain as he beats off his attackers -
they are feral but weak He grabs the burning brand and
springs to his feet trying to gauge his position

There are A DOZEN GHOULS all regrouping ready to attack
again

Kane draws his PISTOL and shoots one in the face It flies
back into the others He hasn’t time to reload again as
they attack

He draws his short sword and begins to hack at them Weight
of numbers and slashing claws force him back and they seem
to feel no pain and have no care for their own safety but
their blood lust is immense As one falls the others begin
to tear at it too

But Kane is pressed back against the crypt walls fighting
for his life now One leaps right onto him trying to reach
his throat shoving him back hard

-and some of the MASONRY GIVES WAY BEHIND HIM The dusty
brickwork collapses backwards into an open space beyond

There’s a TUNNEL which stretches away to unfathomable
darkness

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 70

Kane knows what he has to do now Alternately slicing at
the ghouls and trying to break open the tunnel entrance

He shoves the torch at one of the creatures and sets its
ragged clothing alight It screams around the room igniting
the others it touches

This gives Kane just enough time to tumble through the
small opening and into the dusty and narrow passageway
beyond

He turns and runs as fast as he can into the distance his
torchlight quickly being swallowed in the gloom

The surviving GHOULS scramble through the opening after
him

CUT TO

coming from the floor beneath him He seems satisfied that

But then a SHADOW FALLS ACROSS HIM He turns slowly and
SCREAMSas a blade flashes through the air

HARD CUT TO

The small side door to a BARN is pushed quietly open as the
young shepherd boy THOMAS WOOLMAN enters quickly followed
by MEREDITH She is shaking with cold and exhaustion

THOMAS
Youll be warm in here

MEREDITH
Thank you God bless you

Meredith finds a bale of hay and settles into it

Thomas lights an oil lamp and comes near to her He takes
his heavy wool coat and puts it around her shoulders

THOMAS
Where were you going

MEREDITH
Anywhere Nowhere I escaped from
men who’d captured me Servants
of some terrible evil

For the first time the true impact of Meredith’s loss seems
to overwhelm her She breaks down into tears

THOMAS
Those raiders they came to this
village too They spared the
families of those men who joined
them Others they simply murdered
or took away My sister was
taken and many others

MEREDITH
I am so sorry

THOMAS
She did not escape them but you
did None have done that before

INT TUNNELS BENEATH CHURCH - NIGHT 68

Ragged bloody and exhausted KANE is hiding in a dark
alcove within the tunnels He’s trying to mask his torch
flame and listen to the oncoming SNARLS and FOOTFALLS of
the GHOULS

They’re coming ever nearer Soon they will corner him in
his hiding space and so he takes a breath and RUNS OUT into
the open CORRIDOR

They see him and immediately charge after him The burning
torch hardly throws enough light for him to see where he
might be heading

He makes random careless turns down junctions totally
losing himself in the labyrinth

The walls of the tunnels are lined with crypts coffins and
piles of bones All ancient and dusty

But there is still no way out and he can HEAR THE CREATURES
hunting him

A sudden gust of air makes Kane’s brand flicker and he
knows which way to go now

He steps out into another corridor and
RIGHT INTO A GHOUL that has been stalking him Kane

turns and manages to skewer it onto his sword and race
away

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 72

Ahead of him he sees a shaft of silver moonlight breaking
through the exit to the chamber

TWO MORE GHOULS suddenly leap down in front of him but he
doesn’t break pace he simply CHARGES RIGHT AT THEM
Shouldering one out of the way and carrying the other with
him some distance his sword having passed through it

He flings the body to one side and scrabbles through the
overgrown exit

CUT TO

EXT CEMETERY - NIGHT 69

KANE flops down onto the wet grass and scrambles away All
his attention focused on the exit but nothing is
following him

Exhausted he lies back and takes a moment to catch his
breath

a HUMAN HEAD suddenly lands on the ground right beside
him It is the PRIEST’S HEAD

VOICE 0S
Friend of yours

Kane turns suddenly to find himself facing FIVE RAIDERS on
horseback He rises to his feet and faces them without
fear

Kane recognizes three of the RAIDERS They are THE THIEVES
WHO ATTACKED him in the woods days earlier but now they are
clad in the livery of the raiders The insignia on their
clothes their manner and weapons different from before

The Great Bearded attacker suddenly seems to recognize who
Kane is He laughs

BEARD
Remember this one lads He’s not
a fighter remember

BEARD swings down off his horse SKINHEAD and TATTOO drop
down too They approach Kane slowly clearly looking
forward to toying with him again The other two Raiders
more corrupted and savage looking than the three remain on
horseback

KANE
So you have pledged your
allegiance to this sorcerer
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 73

BEARD
We want to be on the winning
side see Malachi will hold all
this land soon enough

KANE
Is that his name Malachi

BEARD
They say he’s the most powerful
warlock that’s ever been But I
wouldn’t know about that

SKINHEAD
What you doing here Puritan Only
thing round here is fighting

TATTOO
And you don’t do that do you

A beat A smile flickers across Kane’s bloodied face

KANE
Well you know I changed my mind
about that

BEARD
What

Then swift as some great predatory beast KANE LEAPS
FORWARD swords flashing He DECAPITATES TATTOO with one
swift stroke and in a blur of motion drives his blade into
the belly of SKINHEAD

BEARD just about manages to avoid Kane’s returning slicing
stroke of his blade Fast and brutal he attacks Kane The
other Raiders drop from their horses and press in on him
too

Bathed in the silvery moonlight and amongst the hanging
mist of the cemetery they fight though there is never any
doubt as to the outcome

Kane slices the leg tendons of Beard who drops to the
ground screaming then he turns on the remaining two
raiders

ONE IS ALREADY RUNNING FOR HIS HORSE he leaps on and
manages to escape but the other is too slow Kane snatches
up a sword from the ground and hurls it after the running
man It catches him awkwardly across the neck severing his
jugular

Victorious Kane stands for a moment listening to the
whimpering cries of the dying and the thunder of horses
hooves disappearing into the night
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 74

He turns his attention to BEARD who is trying to crawl away
on useless legs He has crawled near the entrance to the

underground tunnels

Kane grabs Beard and pulls him even NEARER to the tunnel
entrance Clawed hands reach out to grab him Beard
screams in fear

BEARD
What are they

KANE
They are your brothers

Kane he takes the locket from around his neck and shows
Beard the picture of Meredith

KANE
This girl your kind took her

BEARD
I don’t know her

KANE
This is your only chance to live
out this night so look
carefully

He pushes Beard back a little nearer Several of the
creatures take hold of him and try to yank him backwards
Their excited snarling fills the air Kane sees their eyes
shining in the dark tunnels

KANE
Have you seen her

BEARD
Yes Yes I saw her

KANE
Where they’re taking her

BEARD
She’s going nowhere

KANE
Talk in riddles and I’11 cut your
tongue from your head

BEARD
She’s dead She’s dead

KANE
What Liar

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 75

BEARD
No I want to live I wouldn’t
lie She’s dead I saw her body
dragged from the wagon I was
there

KANE
No No NO This cannot be She
cannot be dead

BEARD
She is Now I told you what you
want Let me go

Kane releases Beard from his grips Instantly he is grabbed
by the ghouls and dragged back into the catacombs

Kane simply walks away as Beard’s agonized screams echo
across the cemetery as he is eaten alive

Kane seems oblivious to this as he slowly collapses to the
ground against a headstone with an elaborately carved ANGEL
OF DEATH perched upon it

FADE TO BLACK

EXT SMALL MARKET TOWN —- DAWN 70

Rising through the mist shrouded countryside are the WALLS
OF A SMALL MARKET TOWN

A FIGURE ON HORSEBACK emerges through the mist and heads
slowly towards the gates

CUT TO

EXT SMALL TOWN MARKET SQUARE - MORNING 71

There are dozens of stall holders trying to scrape a ragged
living in the SMALL MARKET SQUARE It is filthy wet and
raining but still bustling with bedraggled customers
Amongst them are RAIDERS grouped together drinking and
shouting It seems this town has already fallen into their
thrall The insignia of the sorcerer Malachi the same
that all these Raiders and their followers wear flies on a
pendant over the town

A few of the LOCALS move hurriedly aside as a DARKLY
DRESSED RIDER leads THREE HORSES through the town gates and
into the market square He ignores the sideways glances and
nervous chatter of those he passes Doesn’t care that a
few Raiders watch him

KANE leads the horses through the market to a STABLE
nearby

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 16

EXT STABLE - CONT 72

KANE dismounts and leads the horses past a BLACKSMITH and
towards the entrance of the stable The STABLE MASTER comes
out to greet Kane

STABLE MASTER
Good day to you You’d like to
stable your horses

KANE
I want to sell them

The Stable Master notes the Raider’s insignia on their tack
and saddles He’s suddenly a little more suspicious and
frightened

STABLE MASTER
How did you come by these
animals

KANE
What does it matter

STABLE MASTER
They carry the mark of Malachi
If you stole them

KANE
You cannot steal from dead men

The Stable Master now notices KANE’S BLOODY WEAPONS and
clothing suddenly he’s VERY nervous Looks around the town
square to see if anyone is watching them

STABLE MASTER
Did you kill them

Kane is silent

STABLE MASTER
We heard of a man who has been
hunting them You fought them and
won

KANE
I won nothing

The Stable Master becomes suddenly conspiratorial He takes
Kane to one side

STABLE MASTER
You must hide Sir This town is
theirs all around here they hold
sway Everywhere

(MORE )

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 17

STABLE MASTER(contd)
And spies work for them
listening in shadows betraying
any who would fight back If they
know you are here

KANE
(too loudly)
I don’t care who knows

STABLE MASTER
But there are also others here
who would fight They are just
waiting for enough men

KANE
Then let them fight Pay me

STABLE MASTER
Would you not join them

KANE
No Now pay me - enough to drink
myself into oblivion

CUT TO

INT BARN —- MORNING 73

MEREDITH hidden under a bed of straw opens her eyes to
the SOUND OF THE BARN DOOR OPENING and VOICES She is
completely hidden amongst the straw

JONAH OS
Is she in here

THOMAS OS
Why do we need to do this Father

Through strands of straw Meredith watches THOMAS and his
father JONAH a strong looking middle aged man with a
heavy beard walking alongside He is clearly angry he
grabs his son roughly

JONAH
Because if they find we’ve been
sheltering her there’1llthey’1l
burn us out or worse

THOMAS
She lost her family

JONAH
So did we And I will not lose
anything more to save some
stranger Now find her

Meredith shrinks back into the hay as
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 78

Reluctantly Thomas makes his way towards THE HAYSTACK

THOMAS
Meredith It’s Thomas - come on
out

He pauses for a moment then on the urging of his father
he pulls away the hay

-but Meredith is not there

Suddenly a different haystack right in front of Jonah
erupts as MEREDITH BURSTS OUT and DASHES FOR A HANGING
PITCHFORK nearby

She snatches it from the hanger and whirls on Jonah and
Thomas holding them at bay

MEREDITH
You betrayed me

THOMAS
I am sorry

JONAH
See now girl

Meredith backtracks towards a small side door

JONAH
Listen girl they’re everywhere
now Those who deny them will be
killed we have to show our
loyalty

MEREDITH
And sacrifice me

JONAH
Yes

Jonah suddenly lunges for her MEREDITH DRIVES THE
PITCHFORK INTO JONAH It skewers him through the arm and
shoulder He falls backwards screaming in rage and pain

Meredith tears open the BARN DOOR

-And SCREAMS because

the OVERLORD IS STANDING SILHOUETTED IN THE DOORWAY His
massive bulk fills the frame A cohort of his Raider behind
him

Instinctively Meredith drives her pitchfork into him The

sharp prongs penetrate his leather armour and go deep into
his chest

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 79

Fatal for any other man but the Overlord hardly seems to
notice He yanks the pitchfork from his flesh and grabs
her

Two Raider’s speak for the Overlord

RAIDERS OVERLORD
My Master has a special
punishment for you He has need
of your lifeblood

Meredith fights against his enormous strength tearing at
his mask A section comes free exposing a staring lidless
eye and torn rotting flesh

The Overlord smashes his fist down onto her Meredith’s
world goes black

CUT TO

INT TAVERN - DAY LATER 74

An INNKEEPER makes his way through his CROWDED ALE-HOUSE to
a TABLE IN A DARK CORNER A motley bunch are drinking
themselves into a stinking stupor on his ale Mostly local
PEASANTS but there are a HANDFUL OF RAIDERS in here too

The innkeeper refills a tankard on the table from the
gallon flagon he’s carrying then withdraws A HAND shoots
out of the shadows and grabs his arm

KANE
Leave it all

A bag of coins is tossed onto the table

LANDLORD
As you wish

The Landlord leaves the flagon of ale and scoops up the
money He withdraws quickly

Kane drains his tankard then refills it swiftly He’s
clearly been there a while and is heading for the drunken
oblivion he craves

The locket with MEREDITH’S PICTURE is in his hand

The rest of the place is loud and busy but Kane simply
ignores it He enjoys the gloomy darkness of his corner

TWO MEN - GARRICK and TELFORD - push through the crowd
towards him They stop and peer at this drunken man

GARRICK
Are you certain
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 80

TELFORD
(looking closely)
It’s him I knew it

Kane hardly notices them as they slide in opposite him
Telford is in his early 20’s Garrick a little older Both
are grubby weary and carelessly dressed but not
aggressive They seem nervous scanning the room for
eavesdroppers Neither wants to draw attention to himself
They lean in to Kane who finally looks up

GARRICK
Sir

He ignores the newcomers

TELFORD
Captain Kane Don’t you remember
me
(Kane still ignores
them)
I was a mate on the Queen’s Ship
Fleetway that you captained

Kane peers at him drunkenly

KANE
Never seen you before

TELFORD
We fought in Africa against the
tribes in the cliff caves Don’t
you remember

Garrick pulls Telford to one side

GARRICK
It is not him

TELFORD
It is It’s Kane I’1ll never
forget him This is the man who
can lead us believe me

GARRICK
Where can he lead us To another
tavern Look at him

Garrick turns back to Kane still unconvinced

GARRICK
(quietly)
Hey drunkard My friend here
says you are the greatest warrior
he ever saw I don’t believe him
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 81

KANE
I told you I don’t want

TELFORD
A cohort of Malachi’s raiders
rode out at dawn they were
hunting a man who has been
harrying them for these past
days Was it you

Kane looks up slightly

TELFORD
(urgently and a little
loud)
There are those of us here who
would rally to you Captain Kane

GARRICK
(to Telford)
Keep your voice down there are
others who would betray us

KANE
What do you mean ‘a man like
me’ A failure

TELFORD
No you’re a brave man a
warrior I know what you can do
Captain I have seen it

Kane suddenly grabs Telford across the table and yanks him
close

KANE
You don’t know what you’re
talking about I am nothing

GARRICK
He’s no use Leave him to his
drink

TELFORD

No Captain Kane we need a
leader We have to fight back

It is clear that people have overheard them now

KANE
Then fight

Kane stumbles to his feet He falls a little but rights
himself

TELFORD
Kane

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 82

KANE
I swore to find her and I failed
My life is over

And with that Kane staggers into a GROUP OF DRINKERS who
shove him away aggressively and he topples over
overturning a table and falls unconscious to the floor
The LANDLORD looks down on Kane He notices that some of
the Raiders nearby are taking an interest The LANDLORD
covers this quickly

LANDLORD

This drunkard has had enough
take him to his bed lads

CUT TO

INT INN COMMUNAL BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT 75

KANE sleeps in his clothes on a rough straw mattress His
few possessions are piled carelessly near his bed There
are a handful of OTHER DRUNKS sleeping off their booze

Slowly the DOOR to the BUNKHOUSE creaks open Six dark
SHADOWY FIGURES waiting in the darkness Hushed whispers
inaudible instructions but then one voice a little clearer
VOICE
There Kane is over there He’s
the one I saw

FIVE FIGURES stalk across the room A sleeping DRUNK
wakes

DRUNK
What are you

HIS THROAT IS CUT

The FIGURES SURROUND KANE’S BED swords in hand ROPES and
SHACKLES in others They position themselves carefully

One stumbles makes a noise

KANE alerted rouses from his slumber but is too slow
He fumbles for his sword only to have it kicked away

The ATTACKERS GRAB HIM

tied to the bars by heavy ropes and unable to move

She slumps against her bonds hardly registering the
troughs and pot-holes the wagon hits

CUT TO

EXT MARKET SQUARE —- DAWN 77

CLOSE ON GARRICK’S FACE - SCREAMING in agony With every
BLOW OF THE HAMMER he cries louder His HANDS are being
NAILED TO A WOODEN CROSS by a RAIDER

The STABLE KEEPER is nearby him unconscious and bloody -
already pinned to the wood OTHERS too are lined up anyone
who might have been involved with them is being crucified
in the town square TELFORD is not there though

A PARTY of RAIDERS and LOCALS are raising the crosses The
market square has been trashed any stalls that were left
have been shattered others are burning

The silent OVERLORD watches from his horse as the first of
the crosses are raised The cries of pain are unbearable

The TOWN LOCALS have been herded into a group Raiders with
their weapons ready face them but no one is going to fight

A POSSESSED RAIDER speaks with his MASTER’S VOICE It
echoes unnaturally across the town square

RAIDEROVERLORD

(talking to the

townspeople)
This is the fate of those who
would defy us These traitors in
your midst have brought about
your destruction There will be
no mercy

The OVERLORD turns to see

KANE BEING DRAGGED OUT OF A NEARBY BUILDING by his
CAPTORS He is not struggling seemingly resigned to his
fate

The Raiders haul Kane across the square literally dragging
him over the stones and casting him to the ground before
the Overlord who regards him from behind his expressionless
mask He drops from his horse and approaches Kane
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 84

RAIDER
This is the one Master the one
who hunts us The rebels want him

as their leader

The Overlord leans down to Kane reaches out with a gloved
hand and raises his face to his own The Overlord’s eyes
stare keenly from the mask He is so close to Kane now that
he can whisper IN HIS OWN VOICE It is a frail rasping
whisper He is almost tender as he speaks

OVERLORD
Can you hear me Solomon

Kane stares up at the monster before him

OVERLORD
Do you know me

KANE
I know you for the foul servant
of evil you are

OVERLORD
He cannot be defeated - even by
you Join us

KANE
I am going to kill you all

OVERLORD
You cannot kill one who is
already dead Goodbye brother

The Overlord stands suddenly and turns and strides away
from Kane any hint of humanity or connection is lost

KANE
Brother What do you mean What
do you know of my brother

The Overlord ignores him and once more he speaks through
his minions

RAIDEROVERLORD
(to the crowd)
This man cannot save you from us
He is nothing
Crucify him
Burn this town to ashes

Amidst the screams of protest and fear of the townspeople
the Overlord climbs onto his horse and thunders away
taking many of his warriors with him

The OVERLORD leads his men away As they pass the gated
entrance a GROUP OF SLAVE CAGE WAGONS that have been
waiting outside the town are whipped into action

MEREDITH IS IN ONE OF THE CAGES

EXT MARKET SQUARE —- CONT 79

Under the light of a blood-red dawn KANE is taken and
shoved forward through the crowds The Raiders kick and
punch him Some of the crowd are silent whilst others are
shouting and jeering

ONLOOKER
He brought this on us It is his
fault

In the background PEOPLE are SCREAMING as soldiers set FIRE
to the houses

KANE ignores it all He has already given up there is
nothing more he can do now

They TIE A ROPE AROUND HIS CHEST holding him to the cross
and stretch his arms onto the beams Then the long iron
nails are laid against his palms and POUNDED THROUGH THE
FLESH He grits his teeth against the agony but makes no
sound

RAIDER
(to his companion)
He’s tough They always scream

COMPANION
Did you see the Master He fears
this man above all others

RAIDER
Best make sure he suffers then

The pair continue to SMASH THE NAILS into Kane’s body With
each brutal HAMMER BLOW the SCREAMS Kane can hear all
around him finally begin to fade The leering laughing
faces of the Raiders their punches and blows mean nothing
any more He is dying

His vision flickers to BLACK for a moment

He regains consciousness again as HIS CROSS IS RAISED TO
VERTICAL His body sags down against the ropes holding
him to the main vertical beam His arms pull against the
nails through his palms Blood runs down his arms

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 86

But when he opens his eyes and looks down THE WORLD HAS
CHANGED

HE IS IN HELL

It is the same MARKET SQUARE still burning people still
screaming but everything is heightened He can see the
DEMONS twisting and sliding within the bodies of the
Raiders like foul parasitic creatures feeding on the pain
and fear The VILLAGERS are screaming and twisted in
tortured agony Demons tear at them as their town burns
Dante could not have imagined anything worse

Only now does Kane start to SCREAM

CUT TO

EXT ROAD SLAVE WAGON - MORNING 80

MEREDITH looks up from her stupor as they pass the entrance
to the town

The billowing smoke from the burning buildings smothers
their way in a thick pall and as they pass through the
broken walls of the market town are revealed

And in the town square are FIVE CRUCIFIED MEN

She cannot help but look at the horrific image and sees
---KANE ON THE CROSS

She hears his screams

MEREDITH
Solomon Solomon

She screams now and tears at the bonds Rocking the whole
cage A Raider smacks the cage with his cudgel The
prisoners shrink back in fear

RAIDER
Silence

But Meredith ignores him growing more hysterical with
every moment

ANOTHER RAIDER

Clattering away and increasing pace

hears Meredith’s cries faintly at first as if they are
simply another part of his dying moments but then cutting
through more clearly

away from the village Slowly she is losing sight of Kane
but doing everything she can to retain sight until the last
possible moment even as the Raiders are screaming at her
for silence

EXT SMALL TOWN MARKET SQUARE —- CONT 83

KANE watches as Meredith’s wagon thunders out of sight

KANE

Kane closes his eyes grits his teeth and summons every
last drop of strength he has

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 88

-And with quivering muscles he begins to TEAR ONE ARM
FROM THE CROSS He pulls his wrist forwards the NAIL
SLIDING THROUGH HIS FLESH

He screams in soul shattering agony

The RAIDERS below him stand frozen unable to comprehend
what is happening

And as he screams Kane let’s his weight drop against the
rope holding him up and TEARS HIS OTHER ARM FREE

EXT ROADS —- CONT 84

MEREDITH still trying to see Kane and the village finally
loses sight of them She slumps against her own bonds

EXT VILLAGE - CONT 85

KANE has dropped to the ground now He is stunned and
bleeding trying to gain his breath and work through the
agony

A few of the Raiders have stopped amazed to watch him as
he struggles to a kneeling position blood pouring from his
wounds Kane stares at them with cold fury But he can see
more than just the Raiders - he can see within the more
corrupted Raiders there are DEMONIC CREATURES like a
parasite writhing within its host Evil eyes stare at him
from behind the human masks

Summoning incredible willpower Kane picks up an abandoned
sword and readies for a fight

Instead the RAIDERS TURN AND FLEE

KANE
(shouting after them)
Tell your Master I am coming
Tell him I will wipe him and his
servants from this earth

The Raiders who are running from Kane head towards the town
gates

Then just as they pass through the entrance they are
SUDDENLY ATTACKED by a HANDFUL OF MEN who appear from
behind the town walls The Raiders hardly have time to
defend themselves and are BRUTALLY CUT DOWN

Exhausted Kane barely notices as these rebel fighters
approach him At their head is the young man from the bar -

flickering fire - an ANCIENT CRONE peering down at him and
anointing him with liniments

TELFORD 0S
(hushed whisper )
He was a murderer I know but
don’t we need someone like him

ANOTHER VOICE 0S
You said he killed his own
brother

Huge SHADOWS of other people flicker against the ceiling of
the CAVE he is in The whole place is lit by fires and
burning brands

TELFORD 0S
I do not know that It was just a
rumor aboard the ship

Beyond the old woman stands TELFORD and a DOZEN OF HIS
COMRADES All serious looking men Exhausted battle weary
soldiers talking quietly

KANE
(to the Crone)
Keep your pagan magic away from
me

The wounds on Kane’s wrists and feet have been bound with
leaves and healing pastes

OLD WOMAN
(to Kane)
My pagan magic is more ancient
than your Christian god

KANE
It is evil witch

OLD WOMAN
Not all witches are evil And
there are those who name you evil
Kane You who have one foot in
the realm of the dead now Did
you cross over What did you see

He doesn’t reply

OLD WOMAN
Your eyes see into the shadows
now

KANE

What riddles do you speak

OLD WOMAN
You can see the demons that walk
amongst us Are within us A gift
and a curse

KANE
Get away from me

She slowly rises to her feet and shuffles away from him

OLD WOMAN
You will meet your brother again

pay for you sins

She passes Telford as he approaches

He stumbles a little in the half light but starts gathering
up some supplies and weapons

TELFORD

A young fighter CALDICOTT - not much older than Samuel was -
tries to help him but Kane shrugs his aid away

KANE
Leaving

CALDICOTT
Why

TELFORD

You are barely healed and there
are too few of us just yet

As Kane reaches for swords and pistols Telford stops him
Kane grabs Telford and pins him up against the cave wall A
blade on his throat in a flash

Everyone tenses Swords grabbed people press in - unsure
what to do

KANE
I do not ask you to come with me
I do not want you to

A great brute of a man MCNESS speaks

Kane is shocked
FLETCHER

Aye Axmouth it’s a foul place
Do you know it

KANE
Axmouth Castle was my home I
have not seen it for many years

but I

(almost to himself)
Have I come so far simply
tosimply to return home

FLETCHER
It may have been your home but
you can be sure it will not be
like any home you remember The
village is naught but a ghost
town abandoned to the darkness
The land all about is frozen and
dead

How did this happen
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 93

TELFORD
Malachi opened a doorway to the
underworld Fed with the blood of
his victims he draws forth every
evil thing to corrupt the land

CALDICOTT
They say he sold his soul

TELFORD
He’s in league with a great evil
now and builds an army to carry
him to power The demons he
brings from hell use the bodies
of the raiders

What news brothers

THREE MEN are entering Shaking rain from their long coats
handing over weapons and talking with their comrades in low
voices

The leader of these new arrivals MERTON comes into the
circle of firelight

MERTON
We followed that last slave wagon
the borders of Axmouth I’m
certain we can get through there
are so few guards now His
arrogance is such that he fears
no attack I

Kane stares at Merton who sees this and offers his hand in
greeting

MERTON
Captain Kane I’m glad to see you
well again I’m Jack Merton
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 94

But WHAT KANE SEES is something beyond the human figure of
Merton he sees a shifting shadowy creature within the
human skin peering out with fiery red eyes

Holding his gaze steadily Kane rises and takes Merton’s
hand

MERTON
What’s wrong

Then without a word Kane suddenly YANKS MERTON TOWARDS
HIM draws a pistol from his belt and FIRES INTO HIS CHEST

The report of the gun is deafening and is followed by
turmoil Merton clutches his chest and sinks to his knees
in agony

McNess grabs Kane and hauls him backwards throwing him to
the ground

Half a dozen swords are pointed at Kane’s throat as Merton
dies where he fell

CALDICOTT
What have you done

Kill him Kill him now

Fearlessly Kane pushes the threatening swords to one side
and rises to his feet

KANE

possessed of Malachi’s evil

He was our friend our comrade

KANE
Could you not see what was within
him He was one of them

MCNESS
I fought alongside him He is no
traitor

Kane strides over to Merton’s body

KANE
He was a traitor to you

Kane tears Merton’s clothes open to reveal the SYMBOL OF
THE RAIDERS BRANDED ONTO HIS FLESH There is a stunned
silence

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 95

KANE
Your friend died long ago but his
flesh was being used You could
not have known

CALDICOTT
How did you know

KANE
I can see them As clear as you
are to me now I can see the evil
inside them

TELFORD
All that we planned is known by
our enemy

FLETCHER
Then we have lost How can we
fight this power

Kane surveys the men before him Though they are fierce
and determined they are really little more than farmers
and peasants And now they are confused and nervous

But Kane alone is undaunted

KANE
Gather your weapons

FLETCHER
We are not ready

KANE
Neither are they

MCNESS
We are too few

KANE
I have taken cities with fewer
Telford tell them you know it

is true
Gather your weapons we ride out
now
MIX TO
EXT AXMOUTH VALLEY ESTABLISHING —- DAY 90

Heavy dark rain clouds hang low over the valley There is
no life here The whole world seems trapped in the iron
fist of mid-winter and permanent twilight Freezing rain
lashes down In Kane’s memory this may once have been rich
in life and joy but now it is a black skeletal place

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 96

In the crook of the valley a SMALL TOWN lies silent And in
the distance on a hill is the grey glowering form of
AXMOUTH CASTLE Brooding over the whole valley Beyond
the castle the sea crashes restlessly in the harbour

The only sign of life is a SMALL GROUP OF RAIDERS returning
to the castle with a WAGON OF CAPTIVES Tiny against the
landscape they pass a sentry post just outside the
village

CUT TO

EXT VILLAGE GUARD POST - CONT 91

TWO of MALACHI’S RAIDERS bundled up against the cold
stand guard by a low wall They wave the approaching
Raiders and their wagon full of captives through

SENTRY RAIDER
Any trouble

WAGON LEADER
There is no fight in these
people

SENTRY RAIDER
Do not be so certain of that

The sentry throws back his hood - it is KANE dressed as a
Raider He draws two pistols and shoots the leader of the
wagon raiders

Instantly TELFORD McNESS SMITH FLETCHER HARRIS
CALDICOTT and five others - BRADFORD COOPER HAWKSTONE
GILLIGAN and SOFTLEY - rise up from behind the low walls
and undergrowth With pistols flaring and swords swinging
they engage the remaining FOUR WAGON RAIDERS Quickly
overwhelming them

McNess preferring a CUDGEL to anything more subtle batters
one to a screaming bloody death before beginning to strip
him of his clothes

MCNESS
Do we really have to wear these
They stink These men were
little were animals

FLETCHER
McNess is an animal already

KANE
They were like you once
remember

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 97

As Kane surveys the dead the CAPTIVES IN THE CAGED WAGON
begin to scream for help Arms outstretched begging for
mercy

CALDICOTT hurries to unlock the cage Kane slams the door
closed again

CALDICOTT
You won’t free them

TELFORD
We must let them go

KANE

A party of Raiders returning
without prisoners We will arouse
suspicion

(to the prisoners)
You have suffered but find
strength for just a little
longer We will put an end to
this horror

CUT TO

EXT APPROACH TO THE CASTLE - LATER 92

Heavy rain and thick mist make the going difficult as KANE
and his MEN dressed as a raiding party slowly approach
the ominous and intimidating entrance to the castle There
are SIX RAIDERS as before - the others are now within the
slave cage itself hiding silently amongst the other
captives

KANE and TELFORD are taking the lead Telford stares up at
the imposing castle

TELFORD
(whispering)
Your childhood was here That
explains a great deal

KANE
It was different back then but
never a very happy place even
when my father was Lord

So near to the castle entrance now Too late to turn back
as the DOZEN GUARDS by the PORTCULLIS GATE see them
approaching

MCNESS
We can take these easily

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 98

KANE
We want is to get inside the
gates not start a battle outside
which we cannot win Keep your
mouth shut and your head down

They approach heads bent low slave cage full of
prisoners

EXT CASTLE GATES - CONT 93

At an agonizing crawl Kane and his comrades pass by the
castle guards These Raiders are different from the others
less human even more corrupt and misshapen

As Kane looks at them he sees the evil within shining
through their eyes He can almost feel them staring back
into his own soul

McNess and Fletcher have hands poised over their pistols

With every step Kane feels they’ll be discovered and
attacked but they are not

The PORTCULLIS GATE IS RAISED without a question and they
are allowed into the inner courtyard

EXT INNER COURTYARD - CONT 94

The PORTCULLIS is lowered behind them with a rattle of
CHAINS as they enter the DESERTED COURTYARD

A LONE GUARD waves their wagon over to the dark entrance to
the castle dungeons It is eerily silent now apart from the
rattle and slap of the horse and wagon on the cobblestones

Kane looks around the first time he’s been home for so
many years

KANE
(quietly to himself)
I remember it My home

FLETCHER
Malachi’s lair is in the Great
Hall

KANE

(indicating)
It is that way then

Suddenly KANE SEES A SMALL FIGURE looking down on them from
a balcony window It is THE WITCH who slaughtered the
village She grins at him with her pointed crooked teeth
showing and then darts away
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 99

TELFORD
(seeing the Witch)
Kane

KANE
I know Ready

Kane draws his swords just as the courtyard is suddenly
FILLED WITH GUARDS rushing towards them

Striding amongst them comes the OVERLORD carrying his huge
broadsword with him He lunges for SMITH and HAWKSTONE
They attack him but he is swift and deadly Their blows are
deflected with ease and both are cut down

The Overlord turns his attention to GILLIGAN and the youth
CALDICOTT KANE sees this and charges through the fray

As the Overlord sweeps down a killing blow on Caldicott
Kane brings his two blades together to block it

KANE
(to Caldicott)
Run you cannot win this

The Overlord shoves Kane’s blades aside and returns with a
flurry of blows from his own weapon He is incredibly
swift slashing at Kane’s arm and leg

Kane stumbles and slips to the ground just rolling away
from a killing blow to his head

TELFORD
This way men

Telford leads his men into the castle itself finding cover
inside The guards follow them

Kane and the Overlord close on each other again

Both are well matched but the Kane is being forced back
with each step

Kane manages a slashing cut across the Rider’s body but it
draws no blood and seems to make little difference to him

Kane knows he is in trouble now and is looking around now
trying to find a way out He ducks a low blow and makes a
dash for a low wall He dives over and finds himself

tumbling down some STONE STEPS leading to an OPEN DOORWAY

CUT TO

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 100

INT CASTLE CORRIDORS - CONT 95

KANE dashes through the open doorway slamming and barring
the door behind him and then sprints down the narrow
corridors He’s looking around him moving fast trying to
get his bearings after all these years

INT OTHER CORRIDORS - CONT 96

Ducking down side entrances and other passageways until the
sound of combat and pursuit are far behind

He stops for a moment and gains his breath Then he HEARS
A SOUND Not combat something else something plaintiff
and desperate the sound of prisoners

KANE
The dungeons

CUT TO

INT DUNGEONS - CONT 97

KANE alone peers out from the shadows and down a long
low roofed hallway into the dungeons He’s trying to
remember where to go making several false turns through
doorways and down steps

The SUDDEN SOUND of running feet and shouted instructions
force him to take a side route and scurry down some stairs
into the darker levels

INT LOWER LEVEL DUNGEONS —- CONT 98

MOANS and CRIES of pain and anguish emanate from the tiny
cells Water runs down the walls mingling with effluent and
other wastes It is foul

Kane peers through each tiny doorway portal looking for
Meredith

KANE
Meredith

Suddenly a GUARD APPEARS FROM AROUND A CORNER KANE is on
him in an instant blades flashing across his throat Blood
sprays a nearby wall

HE GRABS THE HEAVY KEYS from the dead man’s belt and begins
to unlock the doors

The CAPTIVES inside cower away from this crazed and
bloodied man who suddenly appears before them

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 101

KANE
You are free Run Go Go now

He opens every door he can heedless of the noise now But

none of the prisoners are Meredith He grabs one of them

KANE
Where are the others Is this all
of you Meredith

He shoves the picture locket into the prisoner’s face

KANE
Did you see here Where is she

PRISONER
I do not know Sir Please I do
not know

Kane flings open all the doors he can find and then finally

comes to THE LAST CELL IN THE BLOCK At first it appears
dark and empty He turns away ready to move on but he
hears a cough and notices a movement in the shadows

He steps into the cell

INT CELL — CONT

There is a WIZENED OLD MAN lying on a bed of filthy wet
straw Kane approaches him

KANE
You are free Quickly leave this
place

The old man simply stares at him His breath wheezing
slowly from his open ragged mouth He hardly seems well
enough to move

KANE
If you don’t want your last days
to be spent here you must leave
now old man

OLD MAN
I cannot leave

KANE
Let me help you then

Despite his urgency Kane kneels to help him but realizes
that HE IS CHAINED TO THE WALL

KANE
Why are you chained here

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 102

OLD MAN
For my sins I cannot leave

KANE
I think perhaps I can break
these chains

Kane draws a pistol

OLD MAN
Even without these chains I would
stay

KANE

Dear God why

OLD MAN
It is my home

KANE
Your home This place is no one’s
home

OLD MAN

It was mine once

Kane suddenly stops and stares hard at the old man He
moves to see him from a better angle to allow some light
to fall on his face Kane is incredulous

KANE
Father

Now the old man regards Kane with the same astonishment

OLD MAN
Solomon

The old man can hardly form words His eyes fill with
tears

OLD MAN
I I thought you lost to me
forever

He reaches out a shaking hand to touch the face of his long-
lost son

OLD MAN
You were just a boy when

Kane begins to tear at the chains Hauling on them with all
his might but making no difference
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 103

FATHER KANE
You will never break these
chains they are forged from dark
magic as much as metal

KANE
Tell me then how can I free you

FATHER KANE
You cannot free me Do not try

Kane’s father coughs His weak body wracked with spasms of
pain Kane cradles his father in his arms

KANE
I have so much shame for what I
did I never meant for Marcus to
fallI never meant for him to
die

FATHER KANE
Die He did not die Solomon He
survived

KANE
Marcus lives I spent all these
thinking I had killed my own
brother

FATHER KANE
He has a life still if you can
call it life

KANE
What do you mean

FATHER KANE
He was so badly injured by the
fall but he did not die Alive in
a way his body did not die but
his mind his soul were lost and
no surgeons or priests could
help And so so I brought
the sorcerer here

KANE
Malachi You brought him

FATHER KANE
I sought him out and he came with
promises of power and healing I
offered him everything I had
just to bring Marcus back to me
I couldn’t lose both my sons

The old man takes a pause now He hardly has the strength
to continue
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 104

Kane can hear the noise outside growing Fleeing prisoners
and the shouts of guards He knows time is running out

FATHER KANE
And he did Solomon Using his
mirrors and magic Malachi
reached into the darkness and
brought Marcus back
But he was changed he had such
darkness such violence and
power He spoke using others
possessing them forcing them to
his way His face was so damaged
by the fall he hid himself
behind his mask and served only
the will of the sorcerer For all
these years we lived in fear of
him and Malachi

KANE
That masked rider he is my
brother

FATHER KANE
Aye That creature is Marcus or
once was I don’t believe there
is anything of my son there now
It is a demon wearing the flesh
of your brother nothing more
Malachi used my son to open a way
for his creatures to come
through

Another coughing spasm takes the old man When he recovers
he can hardly speak

FATHER KANE
Now you must do one thing for
me

KANE
Just ask it and it will be done

FATHER KANE
End my life

KANE
What No

FATHER KANE
I invited the sorcerer in While
I’m alive that freedom holds
That is why I am kept thus He
will never let me die Kill me
and you may hope to drive him
from this land

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 105

KANE
Father I

FATHER KANE
Do it We both have our sins to
answer for I am ready to answer
for mine now

Kane draws his pistol He is in a world of confusion and
pain The old man grabs Kane’s shaking hand and holds the
pistol to his own temple

FATHER KANE
Free Marcus from his slavery

They hold each other’s gaze for a moment and then Kane
PULLS THE TRIGGER

CUT TO

INT CASTLE CORRIDORS - DAY 100

KANE strides down the wide stone corridor undaunted and
unafraid now He knows where he is going There are
SEVERAL DEAD GUARDS lying on the floor behind him

KANE
Brother BROTHER

Closed double doors to the GREAT HALL are at the end of the
long hallway ahead of him

Then off to one side down another long wide hallway he
HEARS FIGHTING

Looking down he sees TELFORD MCNESS FLETCHER and just two
others fighting desperately against a horde of the guards
They are bloodied and struggling soon to be overwhelmed
but fighting onwards

FLETCHER SCREAMS in agony as he is cut down by the
hideously misshapen creatures that protect this place
Telford sees Kane at the other end of the corridor

TELFORD
Kane For God’s sake help us

ANGLE ON KANE

Kane runs to help them Both pistols firing he takes down
two of the enemy and then engages with his two blades

The old Kane of speed and savagery is fully returned as he
turns and thrusts
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 106

KANE
Is this all of you

TELFORD
Caldicott is alive perhaps and
Smith but the othersno

Fast and lethal as he is there are simply too many guards
The survivors are driven back into the main corridor before
the doors to the Great Hall

Though they snarl and cackle they keep their distance
rightly nervous of him

KANE
My father is dead I am the Lord
of this castle now you have no
claim here

Behind him the doors to the Great Hall swing slowly open

THE OVERLORD stands silently sword in hand Even the
misshapen guards fall silent

Kane turns

KANE

(quietly)
Brother

(to Telford urgently)
Free any other captives get them
away from here The girl from my
locket Meredith find her free
her

TELFORD
Kane

KANE
Do as I order

TELFORD
What of you

KANE
You will not see me again I have
to pay for my sins

Telford McNess and the two others make a sudden break
through the guards who make no attempt to follow - all eyes
are on Kane and their Master

KANE
I do know you brother

No reply from the silent figure

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 107

KANE
I know you can speak Again I
ask do you know me brother

Then suddenly ALL THE GUARDS SPEAK AS ONE - with the
voice of the MARCUS

GUARDSMARCUS
You are my enemy

Kane spins to confront them but they do not move He turns
back to Marcus and advances still Though he seems almost
nervous His hand on the hilt of his sword shakes so
slightly The beads of sweat on his brow catch the
torchlight from the walls and each step taking him ever
nearer to his true fate

KANE
I am not your enemy The fiend
who did this to you is our enemy

Without another word Kane’s brother steps back into the
great hall and is swallowed by the shadows

Kane cautiously follows

INT GREAT HALL -— CONT 101

KANE stands in the flickering firelight of the great hall
Drapes cover the windows but there is plenty of light from
the candles and burning brands that fill the space

Hanging from the walls and standing on plinths around the
floors are LARGE BLACK MIRRORS They all have elaborate
etchings on the glass writing in arcane languages and
symbols Very much like those on Kane’s own body

With his vision he can see the demonic creatures writhing
and twisting within their glass prisons They are pressing
up against the surface clearly trapped but eager to be
free

The DOORS SLAM CLOSED behind Kane He is trapped

There is VAST FLAT STONE ALTAR LIKE A WHEEL in the centre
of the hall where THE CLOAKED FIGURE OF A MAN is crouched
over the BODIES tied down to the stone The shadows seem to
be drawn to him a darkness that clings and circles about
him There’s the GLINT of A KNIFE in his hand

KANE
Malachi

The SORCERER turns to Kane He speak with surpassing
smoothness - his voice is velvet yet mocking seductive and
powerful
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 108

MALACHT
Welcome home Solomon Do you like
what I have done with the place

KANE
It will look better with your
head on a spike over the gates

Malachi suddenly slips away from the altar and VANISHES
INTO THE SHADOWS

Kane swords ready waits for a sudden attack but none
comes Nervously he approaches the altar

Channels have been cut into the stone to allow their blood
to flow into a DEEP WELL that seems to have somehow grown
from the foundation stones A pulsing sound like a giant
heartbeat comes from within - along with the sounds of
souls in tormented agony The place is crusted with the
blood of hundreds Body parts and corpses are hanging from
the walls amongst demonic symbols and writings

KANE
Dear god how could this happen

Then he sees MOVEMENT ON THE ALTAR A victim is still
alive He hurries to help them and sees

it is MEREDITH
She is barely conscious battered and bloody Her clothes
are torn her ankles and wrists tied down amongst the other

victims

KANE
Thank God Meredith

She opens her eyes

MEREDITH
I prayed you would come for me

KANE
I swore I would

He cuts one hand free and starts on the other when

-he suddenly winces in PAIN as A SWORD BLADE pierces
through his shoulder

MEREDITH
Solomon

The blade is yanked out again roughly Kane can hardly get
his breath through the pain as he turns and sees his
BROTHER
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 109

ANOTHER DEADLY BLOW SWEEPS IN Instinctively he raises his
own weapon and blocks the strike but it sends him reeling
backwards

Meredith desperately unties her other bonds

MARCUS advances mercilessly as Kane limps away

KANE
Marcus listen if you can hear
meBrother You do not have to

do this

Marcus attacks furiously stabbing and slashing at Kane who
defends himself and backs away

KANE
Where is your master Is he
hiding in the shadows
(shouting out)
Is this how you pay for your
power With the blood of
innocents

Malachi’s voice echoes through the great hall

MALACHI OS
All power is paid for with the
blood of innocents You know that
better than any

The figure of MALACHI the SORCERER appears at the end of
the hall Swathed in dark cloth and drawing the shadows
with him as he moves

MALACHT
See who is here for you Kane

Malachi pulls back a huge cloth that covers a VAST BLACK
MIRROR Four times the height of a man it too is etched in
the spells and symbols of the others But it is what is
waiting inside that takes Kane’s breath

A DEMON is there Huge but trapped behind the magical
surface of the mirror it is like a trapped beast pushing
at the surface that bulges and ripples barely holding back
its enormous power

MALACHI
This demon will not fail to take
your soul back to Hell
And just a little more blood
Kane and it will be free

Kane is frightened now Desperate He turns back to Marcus
urgently
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 110

KANE
Our father is dead Malachi has
no control here any more

MALACHI OS
Remember Solomon your brother is
the heir And I am his master

His brother closes on Kane again but now Kane draws his
second sword and fights back with everything he has

ON MEREDITH

MEREDITH HAS FREED HERSELF and scrambles away watching in
horror as events unfold

ON KANE

Kane backing away from Marcus down a corridor of BLACK
MIRRORS He ducks beneath a devastating roundhouse sword
swing that shatters a BLACK MIRROR sending shards
everywhere The broken demon within screams as it vanishes

MALACHI 0OS
The mirrors No

ON MEREDITH

She stumbles to the doors of the hall She pulls it open
only to reveal the horde of GUARDS pressing in The leaders
of the Guards hold the SEVERED HEADS of TELFORD McNESS and
the others before them

Meredith screams and retreats
ON KANE CORRIDOR OF MIRRORS

Marcus swings his massive sword back and forth at Kane who
ducks and steps back each time And each time another
mirror smashes sending another demon back to hell

Then suddenly Kane thrusts hard with his own swords
penetrating his brother’s flesh But no blood comes out and
the warrior shows no sign of his injury

Marcus grabs Kane and draws him close into a deadly
embrace The life is slowly squeezed from him

Up close Kane can hear his brother’s rattling breath and
strange rasping sounds coming from behind the mask

KANE
Forgive me for what I did to you

Kane struggles against the impossible strength of his
brother scrabbling at his armour and finally getting a
hand to his mask
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett il

KANE
I would see your face one last
time brother

As he TEARS THE MASK AWAY Marcus HURLS Kane away

Kane falls to his knees but looks up at his brother
horrified at what he sees

KANE
My god

It is clear that his brother is nothing more than an
animated corpse One side of his face is smashed in and his
jaw is mostly torn away A LIDLESS EYEBALL stares out from
a disfigured and distorted face The flesh is white and
bloodless with tears in the skin stitched and poorly
repaired

KANE
(yelling to Malachi)
What have you done to him
(to Marcus)
Brother please let me kill this
man who has cursed you I will
lay your soul to rest

Is there just a flicker of something human within Marcus
Slowly lowers his sword and relaxes his fighting stance
But Malachi smothers it quickly

MALACHT
Kill him slave I command you I
order the demon within you
destroy him

Almost involuntarily Marcus begins to surge towards Kane
again

As the ferocious sword blow sweeps down Kane grabs a tall
flaming torch and drives it into Marcus’s chest With all
his own weight behind it Marcus stops dead

The flaming brand burst on his clothing igniting him in
seconds Soon MARCUS IS ENGULFED IN FIRE

BUT IT DOES NOT STOP HIM

The REAPER is pushing ever harder against his mirror prison
walls With every violent blow on the glass it bulges out
more every time

ANGLE ON MEREDITH

She is backing away from the guards as they close in on

her right into MALACHI He sweeps her into his cloaked
armsmuffling her screams
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 112

MEREDITH
Solomon

MALACHI
(to Meredith)
Just a little more blood

ANGLE ON KANE
But Kane sees this

KANE
No Meredith

KANE is focused on Meredith but just in time he realises
that Marcus is right behind him His sword arcs down
towards Kane who dodges out of the way Kane paries more
blows as the burning man presses towards him

ON MEREDITH

Malachi is dragging Meredith towards the Reaper’s giant
mirror She’s struggling and fighting him hard

ON KANE

Kane once again presses in on Marcus relentlessly forcing
him back towards the sacrificial table

The room is beginning to ignite now drapes and fabric
flare up Tables and chairs catch as the two fight

ON MEREDITH

Malachi finally overpowers Meredith He takes her arm and
slashes the flesh with his knife

Her blood splashes onto the Reaper’s mirror Immediately it
begins to MELT THROUGH THE GLASS creating an opening The
BEAST BEGINS TO SLOWLY TEAR OPEN the rent in the glass

ON KANE

Kane now presses hard on the weakening Marcus He’s cutting
and slicing at him and smashing each and every mirror they
pass The howls of the demons fading within

Kane sees the Reaper tearing through the glass The SOUND
of it like a SHRIEKING WIND filling the hall The flames
all around being sucked towards it like a vacuum

Finally Marcus sinks to his knees Through the fire that
burns him stares at Kane Marcus speaks in his faint weak
voice
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 113

MARCUS
Kill me Solomon End my torture
I beg you

Kane draws his strength together and finally sees something
akin to recognition in his brother’s eyes

KANE
Rest in peace brother

KANE SLICES MARCUS’S HEAD FROM HIS SHOULDERS The DEMON
that possessed his body SQUIRMS OUT OF THE RAGGED HOLE IN
HIS NECK Kane can see it clearly

KANE
These eyes of mine see you for
what you are

He stabs the demon and it dies screeching beneath his
twisting blade

MALACHT
No

INSTANTLY ALL THE GUARDS AND RAIDERS BEGIN TO FALTER and
collapse as the demonic power that drives them fades

Kane charges forward to confront Malachi now Behind him
the Reaper in the mirror is beginning to enter this world

Malachi pulls Meredith to him knife to her throat Kane
stops dead

MALACHT
This is how the boy died I saw
that through your brother’s eyes
You begged for his life but did
nothing

KANE
I will not let it happen again

MALACHI
You have no choice Your soul is
forfeit I called Him here to
claim you

KANE
Let her go

MALACHT
I think just one more drop of
blood will do it

KANE
Stop
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 114

Kane lowers his swords to the ground

MEREDITH
Kill him Solomon

KANE
Let her go

MALACHT
Why do you care for her You came
here to save your soul

KANE
She is my soul

Kane whips out the FLINTLOCK PISTOL that has been tucked
into his belt levels it at Malachi and fires

The bullets hits him square between the eyes SPLATTERING
blood and gore onto the mirror

Meredith twists round and violently shoves Malachi
backwards and he falls INTO THE GLASS tumbling backwards
in the black void

Instantly the REAPER is utterly free to step through into
this realm Its cloven foot steps through the glass and
crashes onto the stone castle floor The shrieking wind
rises in tone

Kane dashes forward and pulls Meredith to safety backing
away from the DEMON as it pulls itself into their world and
draws itself fully upright before them

They stand rooted to the spot Meredith terrified but
Kane fearless and unwavering before it

MEREDITH
Dear God what will we do
Solomon Please We must run

KANE
No Wait Trust me

And even as the terrifying predatory face of the Reaper
glares down at them a thousand cracks begin to appear on
it Seconds later the DEMON SHATTERS its myriad pieces
are sucked back into the black mirror surface and then that
too folds and bends back in on itself until it fades to a
singularity and then vanishes Nothing but the ornate frame
remains

The shrieking wind fades to an echo in the great hall as
Kane folds Meredith into his arms Finally she looks up at
him

Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 115

MEREDITH
How did you know

KANE
Your father told me that if I
saved you my soul would be
redeemed I believed him

FADE TO BLACK

EXT HEADLAND - SUNSET 102

KANE his wounds bandaged and his clothes repaired bows
his head in prayer as he kneels before TWO FRESH GRAVES on
the windswept cliff top overlooking the endless expanse of
ocean The last resting place of his Father and Brother

Finally he stands and reaches for the TRAVEL BAGS that are
nearby A horse ready for travel is grazing calmly
nearby Behind the him the CASTLE that was his home
dominates the horizon A figure is racing towards him

MEREDITH
Solomon

He turns to her and waits silently as she approaches

MEREDITH
Solomon where are you going I
don’t understand why you’re
leaving

KANE
I’m sorry

MEREDITH
But you won you defeated them
(still nothing from him)
This is your home

KANE
It was once

MEREDITH
It can be again We can make it a
home together

Kane looks down the cliff to the sea and the jagged rocks
below

KANE
This is where my brother fell
(a beat)

What I did to Marcus here began
this journey
Solomon Kane by Michael J Bassett 116

MEREDITH
Your journey is over Solomon

KANE
It’s not over Not yet
(a beat)
All my travels the things I’ve
seen the things I’ve done
through this I have found my
purpose I know why I am here

She doesn’t understand She doesn’t want to
close to her now

KANE

There are evil creatures walking
this earth Meredith They bring
such pain and suffering and there
was never a man who could fight
them But I can I can It is my
gift and I will hunt them down
and send each and every one back
to hell

Kane comes

Kane looks down at Meredith For a brief moment there is
longing in his eyes she sees this and moves closer

MEREDITH
Please don’t go

Gently he pulls away

KANE
I have to
One day I promise I’1l come home
again but not until my work is
done

He turns from her and slings his bags onto the horse

swords and brace of pistols are visible now as he pulls

himself up onto the saddle

Without looking back he rides away

Meredith watches for a long time until Kane is lost

against the darkening horizon

FADE TO BLACK
