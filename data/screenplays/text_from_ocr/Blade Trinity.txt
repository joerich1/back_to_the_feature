Over darkness a WOMANS VOICE speaks to us

ABIGAIL (V0)

Italo Calvino once said that myth is the
hidden part of every story the buried
part the region that is still unexplored
because there are as yet no words to
enable us to get there

(beat)
But I was there for the end I took part
in it And I think my words can help shed
light on what happened My name is
Abigail This is our story

FADE IN

EXT IRAQI DESERT - DAWN

Harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak unforgiving

stretch of

rocky desert Amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an

ancient Sumerian ziggurat a massive stepped pyramid of
mud

brick that was once the center of the city known as Ur

AN EMACIATED SHEEP HERDER

kneels by the ziggurat tending to a ragged band of sheep
He

is conducting the first of his daily prayers listening to
a

religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny RADIO

Presently we hear HELICOPTERS The sheepherder looks up

approach from the East They touch down near the base of

ziggurat rotors stirring up clouds of dust

FOUR FIGURES

disembark their bodies covered in desert camo-gear They
wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to

teeth To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens

One of the figures turns to the East We can see the
sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- anda
a skull-like under-maskrespirator beneath the face-plate

raises a gloved hand gives the finger to the new day

Another figure (a woman) waves a hand urging them onward
They mount the central steps of the ziggurat

INT ZIGGURAT - SHRINE - DAY

The shrine is empty The woman activates a wearable

device calling up a schematic of the ziggurat

She kneels studying the floor In the corner of the room
identifies a particular brick and presses it We hear

COUNTER-WEIGHTS shifting and the floor opens up --

takes

who
flipped off the sun speaks via radio headset
MALE FIGURE
Thats great Weve got dick
(turning to the others)
Is there any reason we had to embark on
this cluster-fuck during the day
The woman removes her helmet This is DANICA TALOS A
vampire Intense appearing to be in her 30s Possessing
a
regal air She wears a silver crucifix around her neck
DANICA
Night-times too tricky Grimwood You
know that
One by one the others remove their helmets All

GRIMWOOD (30s) a hulking vampire with an imposing

DANICA
Because this was the cradle of
civilization He wouldve been

comfortable here

ASHER

WOLFE
Im not so sure --

Wolfe looks at his unit excited The others gather

Theres something beneath us

ON WOLFES RADAR UNIT

We see a cross-section image of the soil and subsurface
SOMETHING has been buried down

ASHER
Is that a body --

Wolfe makes a few adjustments on the unit The image

further Its definitely a BODY Then we hear the low
RUMBLING of more hidden counter-weights and --

A SLAB OF STONE

slides down from above the stairs sealing off the vault

GRIMWOOD
What the fuck --
Grimwood pounds his fist against the stone Its solid
tries to find a hand-hold tries to shoulder it open in
way but the barrier is unmovable Theyre trapped

Wolfe points at the ground A tiny depression has formed
with sand funneling into it

Wolfe sets his radar unit down and kneels before the hole
The grains of sand are falling faster now the depression
gradually widening Curious Wolfe leans closer --

headless BLOOD erupts from the sand Then --

A HELLISH CREATURE

unearths itself ROARING Its difficult to make out in

INT PHOENIX TOWERS - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Danica moves down a modern architectural corridor lined in
glass and steel VAMPIRE SOLDIERS stand ready nearby
outfitted in body armor clutching automatic rifles

AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR
Asher Grirnwood and another vampire HENDRIX are
gathered by
a titanium door outfitted with a biometric security

system
Danica joins them studying a VIDEO MONITOR which offers a
darkened view of the interior of the vault We can just
make
out a FIGURE sitting there in the shadows
DANICA
Whats he been doing
ASHER
Nothing Just sitting there since we
brought him here
HENDRIX
(nervously)
Do you think weve got enough security
DANICA
Hendrix if he wanted to out of there -
there isnt an army in the world that
could keep us safe We didnt capture
him He allowed us to take him in You
understand

Now open up
The others look at her like shes insane Nevertheless
Danica places her hand on the biometric scanner Hendrix

in a series of commands on a nearby computer console The
vault doors open with a HUM allowing Danica into --

AN AIRLOCK-STYLE VESTIBULE

She steps inside The vault closes behind her We hear
BLOWERS as the air is cycled A SECOND SET OF DOORS open

INT VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSE - CELL - NIGHT
Danica steps into a nearly pitch-black clean room We

hear
BREATHING Despite her calm demeanor shes frightened
From the darkness SOMEONE SPEAKS -- a voice low and
rumbling
laced with an ominous gravity
VOICE (0S)
Why have you woken me
DANICA
Your people need you Sire
She kneels bowing her head
VOICE (0S)

My people You think Im your messiah
Your Savior
We hear MOVEMENT A pair of RED EYES pierce the gloom --
and
God help us even though he remains partially shadowed
this

VOICE
What makes you think I wanted to be
brought back
A hand emerges from the darkness armored Danica wants
to
bolt Instead she fights to keep herself from flinching
asa

taloned finger brushes her throat

DANICA
Times have changed Science has made
great strides Your blood the sacrament
you provide -- it can set us free now
VOICE
I see And the one I killed earlier He
was vampire

You must forgive me It had been
centuries since I last fed

DANICA

Then offer yourself to me child --

LARRY KING launching into the intro of his show

LARRY
Tonight Dr Edgar Vance forensic
psychiatrist and author of the New York
Times best seller Human Health The Whole
Being Breakthrough Also with us is
Martin Vreede Chief of Police Theyre
here for an hour and theyll take your
calls Next on Larry King Live

INT LARRY KING LIVE - STUDIO - NIGHT

Taping is underway Larry King sits at his desk opposite

EDGAR VANCE (40s) a smooth-talking pundit with a magnetic

demeanor and movie star good looks CHIEF MARTIN VREEDE
(50s

square-jawed) joins via remote feed

LARRY
Dr Vance -- youre a psychiatrist anda
biochemist isnt that right

VANCE
Yes Ive long believed that in order to
achieve true health we have to reconcile
the body and the mind Of course that
also requires letting go of a lot of our
old notions and superstitions which is
what my work is all about

LARRY
Lets talk about that How do you account
for the fascination with things that go
bump in the night Movies books
videogames -- seems like we cant get
enough of our boogeymen

Vance leans forward skillfully playing to the cameras

VANCE
Monsters provide a means for us to
transfer our more primal and darker urges
into something external In the case of
vampires youre dealing with taboo issues
like predatory rage and sexual sadism
These are scary subjects for people to own
up to
LARRY
So we pass the buck to someone else

VANCE
Exactly Historically people suffering
from medical conditions have always been
our psychological scapegoats In the
Middle Ages schizophrenia was often
attributed to demonic possession

LARRY
And vampires

VANCE
Well theres a hereditary blood disease
known as porphyria that has symptoms
remarkably similar to the classic vampiric
traits People suffering from this
disease are anemic they become sensitive
to sunlight they cant tolerate garlic --

LARRY
Which is too bad since my doctor tells me
thats good for the heart
(turning to Chief Vreede)
Chief Vreede Whats your take on all the
recent rumors weve been hearing about
vampires

VREEDE

The only vampires Im worried about are
the ones passing the bar exam

(laughing)
Seriously if vampires existed dont you
think wed be on to them by now The
truth is our streets have never been
safer Homicides assaults -- violent
crime is down across the board If people
want to be concerned they should focus on
criminals like Blade

LARRY
Now whos this Tell me about him
we -——

TO

building

explosion

VREEDE
Hes a sociopath weve been pursuing

VANCE
Blade is a very disturbed individual
Even the name hes chosen for himself is
troubling According to witnesses he
operates under the belief that a vast
conspiracy of vampires live amongst us
You have to look at the psychiatric
underpinnings here What does a person
like Blade really want
Odds are hes really trying to work out
some kind of inner trauma He thinks hes
slaying monsters but hes really trying
to murder aspects of himself

Hello Blade My name is Doctor Vance

Gentleman would you mind giving us a few
moments alone

Cumberland nods They rise exiting the room Vance

smiles
trying to project a sympathetic air

VANCE
I imagine this must be very frightening
for you But I want you to know that Im
here to help In order to do that
however I need to ask you some questions
(beat)
Now Can you tell me what day it is

Blade just stares daggers at Vance

What about the President Do you know
whos in the White House at the moment

INT POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Vance sits forward drawing closer

VANCE
What about blood When you drink it do
you find yourself sexually aroused

Blade just glares at Vance

VANCE
You see it strikes me that this business
of vampirism has strong connotations of
sexual confusion Bodily fluids being
exchanged that sort of thing You have
to ask where that comes from Im
wondering for instance what your
relationship was like with your mother
Were the two of you close

Blade glares If he escapes hes going to kill this guy

Dr Vance steps into the observation room joining Chief
Vreede Cumberland and Hale

Whats your assessment Doctor

VANCE
Hes psychotic with paranoid features
possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy
Hes exhibiting disorganized behavior He
obviously doesnt have a properly formed
conscience --

(spreading his hands)
For his safety and the publics Im
recommending that he be transferred to
County Psychiatric for further treatment

Thats unacceptable This mans wanted in
connection with a laundry list of federal
crimes I need him on a plane to the

Cumberland and Hale look to Vreede with disbelief

HALE
Chief weve got a federal arrest warrant
here that clearly supersedes --

VREEDE
I dont care about your warrant Were in
my jurisdiction now Youve got an issue
with that you take it up with the local

nice yarn But the events he described in

Why wake up Drake now

Thats what weve been trying to figure
out
KING
When I was under the fang there used to be
talk about some kind of vampire Final
Solution But I could never figure out
why theyd want to destroy their food
source I mean seems stupid right
Theyve always had plans for the human
race Seems likely that whatever theyre
cooking up Drakes return is a part of
it

Blade nods pensive

KING (CONTD)
Lets face it Blade -- were fighting a
losing battle
So we kill a few hundred of them a year
Big deal There are thousands of them out
there Maybe tens of thusands We need
a new tactic

KING
Think about it Blade We could wipe
them all out in a single move
BLADE
So whats been holding you back

SOMMERFIELD
(sighing)
Weve tried it on a number of captive
subjects Weve got the disease vector
worked out fine -- its easily
transmittable But the lethality in
vampires is still spotty

ABIGAIL
Bottom line is we need a better DNA
sample to work with
(beat)
We need Draculas blood

SOMMERFIELD
Vampire DNA is a hodge-podge of different
genes mixed in with all sorts of useless
junk DNA Because Draculas the
progenitor of the vampire race his DNA is
still pure It hasnt been diluted by a
hundred generations of selective mutation
It still has all the necessary cellular
compounds for the virus to code to We
get his blood we can boost Daystars
viral efficacy to a hundred percent

He wouldnt have a traditional skeletal

decided to go after the vampires food
source The one thing we know for sure

about vampires is that they have to drink
blood
TO

of

away

If we manage to pull this off well be
able to contaminate every blood source on

to feed on

Doesnt do us any good if we dont have
time to finish it We cant just sit
here We need to take the battle to them

Sommerfield lowers her head thinking

SOMMERFIELD
If the vampires are trying to isolate the
hereditary factor in Drake that makes him
immune to sunlight theyll require
certain kinds of laboratory equipment and
provisions For instance theres an
enzyme called Taq Polymerase And there
are only a limited number of suppliers
