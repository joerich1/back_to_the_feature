EXT STREET - DAY

The washed out sky hangs over the open fields in the middle
of nowhere It has rained recently and the ground is wet
around the scattered mail boxes that line the old gravel
road

The street is deserted Empty

DETECTIVE (VO)
Okay Let’s try and do this all at
once(Coughs) Can you hear me
alright I’m just gonna start
Alright

EXT HOUSE - DAY

A large single story house sits a thousand yards from its
closest neighbor There is a long cement driveway that leads
down the side of the property

At the end towards the house sits a once blue four-door
sedan Smoke rises above the charred remains The windows
are smashed out and the tires are slashed Broken pieces of
glass surround the car as it sits flat against its metal
rims

The car is running

Over the blackened hood stands a faded basketball goal A
net hangs on for its life from the rusty orange hoop

DETECTIVE (VO)
1801 Clark Road Stop (Coughs)
1801 Clark Road as follows 4
kitchen knives varying sizes 2
candle sticks One large axe with
wooden handle

EXT STREET -—- DAY

TWO YOUNG BOYS both in their early teens walk side by side
with their bicycles They wear pressed white shirts and
black slacks

They are Mormons

The taller boy has a backpack slung over one shoulder The

other one holds a pile of pamphlets They both have flat
tops
The boys make their way down the street and they huddle close
together to attempt to shield themselves from the wind
whipping across their skin

They are two houses down from the basketball goal So far
no one is home on the street They take turns walking to
each house knocking and ringing the doorbells When there
is no answer they leave the pamphlets on the mat or in the
mailbox and walk back up to the road again

The boys do not play around with each other as they walk the
road between houses They concentrate on the task at hand
each solemnly staring forward as they pass the overgrown
yards

DETECTIVE (VO)
Matches One double barrel shot
gun 5 empty shells Baling wire
A broken champagne bottle Two
empty bottles of beer

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Music drifts out to where the boys stand on the street from
somewhere within the large house

The boy with the backpack waits at the mailbox as the smaller
one walks down the driveway towards the blue-black family
car

The smaller boy waves and calls out for his friend to come
closer The music grows louder so as to drown out all other
sound

Eventually the boy with the backpack lays both the bikes
down on the side of the street and walks towards the front
porch cutting across the grass

The smaller boy stands near the car staring at his
reflection in the broken driver’s side window He calls out
to the boy with the backpack again then chases after him up
towards the house

EXT PORCH -—- DAY
The boy with the backpack picks up a champagne cork as they

walk along the sidewalk to the porch The smaller boy laughs
nervously as they get closer
The boy with the backpack does not take his eyes off what is
left of the front door

Several pieces of wood lie at their feet as they stand under
the eave of the house The boy with the backpack nudges his
friend towards the door but neither one walks inside

BOY
Hello

Their bikes remain on the street

DETECTIVE (VO)
A lot of blood In several rooms
We have some usable prints We
need to get some people out into
the yard We have to go out into
the field

INT HOUSE - DAY

Dark shadows still surround most of the living room ahead of
them as the boys make their way down the front hall The
smashed pieces of a fire alarm lie on the ground near the
entry way

Inaudible beneath the sound of the music the boys call out
as they walk through the darkened room the pamphlets hang at
the younger boys’ side

DETECTIVE (VO)
(Coughs) No conformation yet on
names We’re working on it We’1ll
be here all night This is bad

INT HOUSE -—- DAY
The boys walk through the living room as the music grows
louder No one responds to their calls

INT PARLOR —- DAY

A record spins on an old worn out player The needle is
close to the end as the volume steadily rises

DETECTIVE (VO)
That’s all we got right now Let’s
go Turn this thing off

The record slows and then stops leaving only the sound of
static as the needle rides the edges before stopping

The house is completely quiet
One of the boys screams

FADE TO BLACK

KRISTEN MCKAY WAS BORN ON AUGUST 26TH

JAMES HOTOPP WAS BORN ON OCTOBER 12TH

ON THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 1ST 2004
THEY ATTENDED THE WEDDING AND
RECEPTION OF KRISTEN’S COLLEGE
ROOMMATE ELIZABETH BROOKHART BETWEEN
THE HOURS OF 530PM - 300AM AFTER
SAYING THEIR GOOD-BYES THEY RETURNED
TO THE SUMMER HOME OF PRESTON AND MARY
BETH HOTOPP JAMES’ PARENTS

INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

The doorway is dark as JAMES and KRISTEN walk in silently
The bags and the cramped hallway make for a less than
graceful transition inside the house They are tired and
angry

James walks ahead carrying the luggage Kristen stands at
the doorway finishing a cigarette in the warm light of the
porch She wipes tears from her face

They are still dressed from this evening’s wedding but both
look as if they have seen a battlefield The stains of red
wine cover Kristen’s skin James’s white shirt is now more
pink than anything else One of his hands is scraped away at
the knuckles There is a small bit of blood
INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

It is dark inside as James walks around the huge living room
He bumps into random pieces of furniture while he navigates
his way around the crowded space in the shadows

He tosses the bags down in disgust as he searches for a lamp

INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

Kristen flicks her cigarette into the grass and closes the
door blocking out the little light that was shining into the
house leaving them in total darkness

James slams into the corner of a table

JAMES
Thank you

Kristen’s high heels make their way over the tiled entry hall
and onto the hardwood floors of the living room

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

KRISTEN
I’m sorry

The sarcasm hangs in the air from both their voices as James
finally gets a lamp on

Kristen watches James’ movements as he walks around flipping
on switches with disgust Her face reacts to what she sees
being illuminated in front of her Each pool of light
reveals more of the surprise James had planned for her that
night

There are two place settings surrounded by candles on the
dining room table A bottle of champagne chills in an ice
bucket Many bright flower petals are scattered across the
couch

With each flick of a switch James attempts to remain
emotionless but his hands tremble as he works

Kristen reaches for support accidentally leaning back
against the piano keys An abrupt burst of sound from the
piano causes her to jump Without trying to restrain
herself tears flow down her wine stained face
INT PARLOR - NIGHT

James turns on the light in the parlor and the record player
starts up There is a second of static and then the chords
of an old country song slowly come up to speed This hurts
Kristen even more

James is caught off guard by these breaks from the silence
and he moves to shut down the record player but he pauses
for a second and they both listen to the familiar song

KRISTEN
When did you do all this

JAMES
Today When you were with the
girls Mike came down with me this
morning You were gone a long
time

His back is turned to her He watches the record swivel
around in circles

INT LIVING ROOM -—- NIGHT

Kristen bends down and begins digging through one of her

bags She cannot find what she is looking for Her
movements are rushed her hands violent

JAMES
What is it What do you need
KRISTEN
I wanna take a bath Where are my
things
JAMES

I brought everything all your
stuff It’s in the back

She looks up at him and this time he looks back at her
KRISTEN
I’m sorry I just thought you
forgot them

JAMES
No
INT PARLOR - NIGHT

James turns back to the record player for a moment

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Then he walks over to the dining room and takes out a small
ring box from his coat pocket placing it on the table

JAMES
Come on

INT HALLWAY —- NIGHT

He walks past her without a look in her direction and she
follows him towards the light pouring from underneath the
door at the end of the hall

INT BEDROOM —- NIGHT

When James opens the door more of his preparation for their
romantic evening is revealed More rose petals cover the
bed and what seems like a million or more candles wait to be
lit around them

He flips on the bathroom light and grabs another champagne
bottle from near the bed As he crosses back towards the
door he slowly brushes past Kristen For a second they
stand close to each other then he moves to the door

JAMES
You can have this room I’11l get
set up out there I don’t know
about the tub I put roses in
there too We didn’t know if they
can go in first

Kristen almost wants to laugh but she doesn’t

KRISTEN
I don’t know either

He goes to leave but turns back

JAMES
Come here Let me get this

He reaches over and touches her back unzipping her dress for
her She pulls it off with the ease of someone who has
undressed in front of a person hundreds of times before

KRISTEN
Thank you

He leaves her standing near the doorway

JAMES
I’1l turn the heater on

KRISTEN
It’s okay I know you hate it when
it’s hot

JAMES
It’s alright

He walks away

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kristen runs a bath sitting on the edge of the tub while she
takes off her jewelry The water is rusty and she watches
it mix with the red rose petals for a few seconds before it
becomes clear

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

James walks outside holding the champagne bottle After a
few seconds he pops the cork and takes a long drink and then
sets the bottle down on the sidewalk near the door

In the quiet distance the sound of knocking floats in the
air past the trees The noise is faint but it stands out on
the empty country road

He walks over to his car and opens the trunk grabbing a 12
pack and a bag of ice

On the way back he sings one of the songs from the record
and kicks the champagne into the grass on his way to the
door The bubbly liquid drizzles out into the ground

The knocking has stopped It is silent once again
INT PARLOR - NIGHT

The record has played through and now the static pops as a
reminder it needs to be turned over James lifts the needle
off and places it on the stand The house is quiet

He can hear the clinking of the wind chimes that hang on the
back porch just beyond the windows

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

James walks over to the dining room and flips off the
overhead light In the darkness he grabs a book of matches
lighting the candles he had set out before He picks up the
ring and sits down at the head of the table He holds a
carton of ice cream and a spoon Alone in his tuxedo he
sits eating the ice cream straight from the box

INT BEDROOM -—- NIGHT

Kristen stands in front of the mirror looking at her face
Her eyes are red and puffy A layer of mascara surrounds
them She drops the towel and slowly places the dress back
on This time she zips it herself

INT LIVING ROOM -—- NIGHT

Kristen walks out into the living room

KRISTEN
James

She sees him and walks in grabbing the second bottle of
champagne
INT DINING ROOM -—- NIGHT

She sits down next to him unwrapping the foil from the top of
the bottle

KRISTEN
It’s nice

JAMES
Do you want to make a toast
KRISTEN
No

The cork pops over the table The
dress she has put back on

JAMES

excess pouring onto the

I put your clothes in there In

the dresser by the door

KRISTEN

I wanted to wear this I only get
to wear it tonight It makes me

feel pretty

JAMES
You are pretty

She pulls her still damp hair up
band from around her wrist

James stares down at the ice cream
candles dances across his face

Holding it with a rubber

The light from the

She takes a long drink from the bottle and sits it down

KRISTEN
You didn’t do anything
do anything wrong

JAMES

You didn’t

It doesn’t feel like that

KRISTEN

I don’t know what you want me to

say

JAMES

What do we do now Where do we go

from here

KRISTEN
I don’t know

JAMES
You should

KRISTEN
Why

Kristen scans the room tapping the cigarettes she holds in
her hand against her knee James takes a bite of ice cream
as his eyes watch the pack move up and down on her skin

JAMES
You can smoke if you want

KRISTEN
Your dad won’t get mad

JAMES
I don’t care He won’t after this

She lights one and James gets up and grabs a saucer from the
kitchen He slides it over to her side of the table

KRISTEN
I love you okay

He starts to speak but catches himself
They both take a second James puts the spoon on the table
He pushes the ring over to her

KRISTEN (contd)
I don’t want it

JAMES
You should take it I can’t keep
it I can’t take it back

KRISTEN
Yes you can

JAMES
---no I can’t

KRISTEN
Oh

The rings sits on the table between them

KRISTEN (cont’d)
I didn’t want this That’s all I’m
saying I was happy two hours ago

James closes the lid of the ice cream leaving it on the
table He picks up the ring again For a moment they just
watch each other James stares at her wavering eyes

He opens the case and looks down at the ring Then he puts
it back on the table and stands up Kristen reaches out and
grabs his hands as he walks past her towards the record
player She lets his hands slip through hers as he moves
away from her

JAMES
Jesus

KRISTEN
I’m sorry

JAMES
This is so embarrassing

KRISTEN
I’m sorry

INT PARLOR - NIGHT

He slides his rented shoes across the dusty floor and stares
at the candle clumsily placed on the record player earlier
today

JAMES
I honestly was gonna ask before
your mom died That’s funny
somehow

He flips through the records he had laid out from the large
collection

After a few seconds he puts on his selection and from the
speakers comes a song they both obliviously know

Kristen gets up and both of them stand close to each other
His hand slowly comes around behind her starting on her ass
and moving up her back They seem awkward at first

The tension between them still hangs in the air but
gradually it begins to fade

INT DINING ROOM -—- NIGHT

The song does not seem right to dance to It is too slow a
folk country song but as her small arms wrap around his neck

they begin to move slowly in a circle

It is dark where they stand between the rooms Her bare
feet rest slightly on top of his shiny rented shoes

Eventually they move in place rocking back and forth
without turning

James and Kristen stop dancing all together and instead just
hug as the song comes to a stop For a few seconds the only
sound comes from the rustling of their clothes his hands
sliding down her dress her small hands coming up his back
then squeezing his neck

Another slow song follows and without any effort at all
James pulls Kristen up on his hips and slides her onto the
table Her dress rises up over her thighs as she unbuckles
his pants

They have not kissed His face is buried inside her neck
Then they both pause for a brief second before she moans
lightly and one of her legs dangles to the side

He leans her back further against the table One of the
unused place settings slides over against the candle

Outside the wind chimes rattle softly against each other

INT DINING ROOM -—- LATER
A loud knock on the front door echoes through the house

The sound snaps the couple out of their trance and James
breaks their embrace He quickly buttons his pants as
Kristen pushes herself off the table pulling her dress down
over her thighs James tosses her underwear behind the
couch

They both take a second to calm their rapid breathing James
pulls his shirt all the way out and straightens his jacket
while Kristen uncomfortably searches for somewhere to look

James laughs to himself to break the tension that hangs
between them

JAMES
Who is that

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

He walks into the light of the living room and Kristen
follows him

JAMES
It’s like three in the morning

KRISTEN
I don’t know Be careful

INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

James opens the door and a YOUNG WOMAN stands shivering
She is in her 20’s but in the right light she could be 15
He looks up and down the street and sees nothing but
darkness He rubs his arms for warmth and looks her up and

down

JAMES
It’s cold

YOUNG WOMAN
Hi

JAMES
Hey

YOUNG WOMAN
Is Tamara here

He looks at her puzzled Her face moves in and out of the
darkness

JAMES
No no Wrong house

YOUNG WOMAN
Are you sure

JAMES
Yeah I’m sorry

She shifts her attention to Kristen briefly

YOUNG WOMAN
You look pretty

KRISTEN
Yeah

Kristen laughs uncomfortably

KRISTEN (contd)
Sorry thank you

JAMES
Are you lost

YOUNG WOMAN
No I’m okay See ya later

She turns and walks out onto the grass towards the road away
from the glow of the porch and the street lights that still
shine

For a moment James and Kristen stand staring after her into
the darkness

KRISTEN
That was weird

JAMES
People get lost out here Should I
go get her

KRISTEN

She said she was fine She didn’t
seem scared or worried or anything

JAMES
Whered she go

The street is empty
KRISTEN
I can still hear her steps on the

road Listen She’s fine

James shuts the door slowly still looking out towards the
road

INT LIVING ROOM -—- NIGHT

The moment is lost from before and as they return to the
living room both seem confused as to what to do now
Kristen gradually moves back to the dining room to grab her
cigarettes

She looks down at the empty pack sitting on the table

KRISTEN
I’m out of cigarettes

James walks in behind her He stares at the records

JAMES
I’1l go get some more

KRISTEN
That’s not what I meant You don’t
have to
JAMES
I know but I need to get out of
here
KRISTEN
It’s okay I’11 just go to sleep
JAMES
No you wont
KRISTEN
I’1l try
JAMES

It’s okay I really need to drive
for a while Are you gonna be
alright here

KRISTEN
YeahYeah it’s fine Thank you

He grabs his keys off the table but pauses for moment

JAMES
Let me light you a fire

He pulls some dusty wood from a stand near the couch It
takes a second the fireplace door jams and he pulls it open
roughly

JAMES (contd)
I was thinking when you were
taking a bath I want you to take
the car back tomorrow This is
awkward enough as it is

Kristen nods her head watching him work

JAMES (contd)
A road trip might kill us both
I’1ll fly back We’re not gonna
decide anything on I-35 you know

KRISTEN
Are you sure

JAMES
Yeah

They both watch as the fire builds eventually grabbing hold
of the old wood

JAMES (cont’d)
Ill be back If you want we can
talk moreor not

He walks towards the front door as the wood cracks in the
heat He does not look back at her as he speaks

JAMES (cont’d)
I love you Okay

KRISTEN
I love you too

JAMES
I’m really sorry

He leans against the door frame to the hallway his keys
rattling in his hand

KRISTEN
Did you talk to Mike

JAMES
No You know he’s gonna be pissed
at you He hates this kinda shit

He motions to the room scooping up a pile of rose petals
near the door Then he leaves her

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

She pauses at the foot of the table opening the small black
box and pulling out the ring It is nice but nothing
extravagant

She slides it on her finger but it does not fit She laughs
to herself She picks up one of the cloth napkins from the
table and blows her nose

Then she tries to pull the undersized ring off but
reconsiders and pushes and twists until finally the band
slips on

INT PARLOR - NIGHT

Kristen moves over to the record player She scans through
the albums James had picked out and then to the others
finding a different selection

She places it on the turntable and drops the needle After a
few seconds a voice comes from the speakers and she heads
into the kitchen

INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT

She stumbles a little from the champagne then steadies
herself on the counter Her hands dig into the sink fishing
through the ice that James had grabbed earlier from the car

until she finds a beer

She twists open the bottle and leans against the counter
absently tossing away the cap

A knock comes again from the front door She pauses
listening past the record Two more knocks then a third

She puts down her beer and walks towards the entry way

INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

She stands in front of the wooden door listening outside
Her hand squeezes the door knob but she does not open it
Wind squeaks through the cracks at times making it hard to
hear the voice coming through

Another knock this one lighter than the others

KRISTEN
Hello

WOMAN
Is Tamara here

KRISTEN
What

WOMAN

Is Tamara here

KRISTEN
You already came by here

WOMAN
Are you sure
KRISTEN
Yes Are you’re okay
Silence
KRISTEN (contd)
Hello
Nothing

KRISTEN (contd)
Are you still out there Are you
lost

She presses her ear against the wood She can barely make
out light footsteps as they walk away from the porch moving
from the concrete onto the grass

She waits until they are completely gone and turns to walk
back into the living room

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

The record plays from the parlor and she seems caught between
the sound inside the house and the silence outside of it
She wanders quietly between the spaces within the house

A sound comes from the backyard that seems like a piece of
patio furniture moving against the concrete

INT HOUSE - NIGHT

Kristen pauses before taking a pull from her beer holding it
just beneath her lips She does not react strongly her
shoulders tighten but it is barely noticeable After a few
seconds Kristen’s face relaxes and she takes a sip of beer

She walks over to her bags in the living room and digs
through all of them searching

With a momentary smile she finds what she is looking for a
cigarette pack with one remaining She walks back over to
the dining room table and uses one of James’ matches

There is a break between songs and she can hear the wind
chimes outside the back window blowing in the breeze

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

She moves over to the couch and sits down blowing a cloud of
smoke into the air

She takes another drag and watches the smoke pour over her
face before realizing that there is way too much in the room
for one cigarette The vent is closed on the fireplace

Kristen tries to open the vent but it is jammed It is hard
for her to grab leverage in her dress as she has to climb up
on the firewood in her bare feet to get high enough to drop
the handle

Just as she succeeds the smoke alarm in the entry hall goes
off producing an ear splitting ring that almost causes her
to fall

She races to find a chair to reach the buzzing bomb on the
ceiling Her fingertips are just barely able to hit the
button but the sound continues Finally she pulls it off
the wall and removes the battery

As she steps off the chair again she hears a knock from the
door She turns and scans the room behind her her eyes fall
on the back door

Again she hears a knock

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

Kristen sits down on the chair in front of the entry way
listening She can hear a hand sliding up and down the
wooden door

She rests on the chair her knees rocking the four legs back
and forth on the hard wood floors After a couple more
knocks on the door it stops and then nothing

The record is finished

The only sound comes from her rocking back and forth as the
hardwood floors creak beneath her

Outside the wind chimes tap against each other near the
windows

Kristen stands up and digs through her bags by the door
eventually finding her cell phone She pushes the power
button and it immediately beeps and shuts back off again

KRISTEN
Fuck

She pushes the power button again a beep then it turns
itself off

After trying unsuccessfully to get it to work she unzips her
bags and dumps most of their contents onto the ground below
her She digs through the folded skirts her bras and
underwear until she finds it Her cell phone charger
Slamming it into the outlet on the wall near the fireplace
Kristen frantically plugs in her phone then moves for the
kitchen

INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT

She picks up the receiver off the old rotary phone on the
counter before realizing that it is more a prop than anything
else There is no cord connecting it to the wall The wall
jack is taped over

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

Kristen walks back into the living room past the dead smoke
alarm lying on the floor next to the wooden chair and goes
into the bedroom She stops and stares at the dark doorway

INT BEDROOM —- NIGHT

Under a pile of rose petals on the night stand she finds a
cordless phone

She picks it up and gets a dial tone She gets up on the bed
to reach the windows above it She pulls back the curtains
slightly with one hand as the other dials the phone quickly

She calls James as she studies the front yard

KRISTEN
Where are you

She climbs down from the bed and heads out of the room
peeking down the hall All is quiet

KRISTEN (cont’d)
It’s nothing It’s just weird
That girl came back Tamara

INT HALLWAY —- NIGHT

She walks into the hallway on the tips of her toes each step
slower than the last The warm light from the living room
wraps around her as her eyes dart back and forth scanning the
space

INT DINING ROOM -—- NIGHT
The candles still glow casting shadows on the empty walls

She digs through the ashtray as she listens She wipes away
the ashes from her hands on her dress before salvaging a few
drags left on one of her cigarettes

KRISTEN
She just kept knocking I heard
her voice No I didn’t open the
door ‘Cause I didn’t want to

Outside the wind chimes strike softly together in the
breeze As she listens to the other line she stares at the
windows

KRISTEN (cont’d)
How much longer till you get back
No I’m fine It’s just weird
I’m charging it right now Okay
Just come back soon Okay Bye
James

She sets the phone down on the table The house is still
Kristen’s breath is the loudest thing in the room

The candles flicker on the table as she stands in silence

INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

By the entry way the chair sits with the alarm on top of it

INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT
Kristen walks back into the kitchen and grabs another beer

For more than a minute she stands with her back to the
window leaning against the counter and nursing her beer

She slides her bare feet back and forth across the tile floor
as she drinks

INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

Across the room near the front door and the chair a MAN
watches her He is tall and slender He wears a grey suit
and a mask It is a smiley face like the buttons from the
seventies but the mask is white and the smile is a bit out
of place

He watches her drink but she never turns his way His mask
seems to flow in and out of the light of the room as he rocks
back and forth The pale white plastic seems to glow in the
warmth of the lamps and fire and then just as quickly fades
to gray then black

INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT

Kristen is oblivious to his presence Then he is gone out
the front door It closes with a loud thud breaking Kristen
of her trance

KRISTEN
James

There is only silence She looks around the kitchen
Quietly she begins opening drawers one by one until she
finds the utensils She pulls out a butcher knife half the
size of her frail arm and turns around to face the empty
room

INT DINING ROOM -—- NIGHT

Kristen walks over to the candlelit table and picks up the
phone Lifting it to her ear we hear the familiar beep of
the cordless and then nothing She laughs to herself and
again the beep sounds

KRISTEN
Hello

She dials the numbers

KRISTEN (contd)
Hello Hello

Nothing

She quietly sets the phone down near her ashtray and the
remainder of James’ melting ice cream

Again she hears a knocking on the door Her head whips in
the direction of the noise She picks up the phone and tries
it again It is dead

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

Kristen walks to the living room and this time as she passes
the chair she looks down at the alarm resting in the middle
of the seat

The knock on the door does not register on her face For a
few seconds she just stares at the piece of plastic that she
took from the ceiling and placed on the floor

Without looking up she moves towards the wall where only
minutes ago she had plugged in her phone The outlet is
empty The phone is gone

Kristen backs away from the wall then dives towards it
feeling for the phone behind her bag and in the scattered
clothes that lay on top of it

KRISTEN
This isn’t happening

Out of the pile she pulls out a pair of running shoes She
moves over by the fire and starts to untie the laces but she
keeps her eyes locked on the chair and beyond it to the door

Silence

Outside she can hear the wind chimes softly bump together
against the wind The fireplace crackles behind her back

Two knocks on the door The cordless phone slips off the
couch and with a loud bang hits the floor Kristen’s eyes
dart back and forth between the phone and the door in front
of her She whispers to herself

KRISTEN (contd)
Oh my god

She grips the knife in her hand The blade shines in the
light from the fire Her feet remain bare

The wind chimes strike again but this time they are much
louder a crash of medal rods slamming together and then
silence Then gradually they begin to clang together again

Kristen’s eyes wander throughout the house behind her and
into the dining room Eventually they rest on the curtains
over the window to the wind chimes

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

Slowly she gets up leaving the phone and her shoes on the
ground and walks over to the waving light of the candles
She holds the knife at her side and stares directly ahead
past the table at the curtains

She walks on her tip toes past the ice cream and the ring
case and with her free hand begins to feel around the wall
behind the curtain until she flips on the porch light

She very slightly jumps when she hears the sound of a chair
bumped across the concrete and then silence She timidly
peeks through the crack where the two sides of the curtain
meet The knife shakes at her side

Kristen looks back over her shoulder at the entry way but
there is no knocking Her hand slides up and down the edge
of the curtain The wind chimes are only a couple of feet
away

She leans back throwing the curtain all the way open Then
she sees him

It is brighter outside than in the room and for a moment
the glare is confusing to her but the outline of his mask is
clear She can see the smile The man stands still his
only movement a slight rocking on the balls of his feet as he
stares back into the window

Then he touches the glass

Kristen screams her cry full of dread and fear She runs
towards the front door As she passes the record player it
slams to life catching on the song from before The same
phrase begins repeating over and over in the quiet room

She races down the hallway to the entry way towards the front
door and the music the skipping voice seems to follow her

INT DOORWAY - NIGHT

Kristen opens the large wooden door but before she walks
out she stops and looks into the blackness of the
surrounding area It is eerily calm outside James is still
not home The empty street is completely deserted

She is confused She hides behind the door looking over her
shoulder back towards the living room and then forward
again to the outside

She hears a slight movement from the yard but when she looks
out she sees nothing

She thrusts the door forward but then pushes it open again as
she tries to get away from the voice of the record player
behind her She stares out into the darkness her eyes
trying to see into the night

KRISTEN
Hello

Nothing

WOMAN (0S)
Shut the door

This time Kristen slams it closed and hears the champagne
bottle James had left earlier burst against the wood Again
she is surrounded by the skipping record still blaring from
the other room

She twists the door handle until it won’t turn any farther
The door creeks open and she peeks outside again

She can see the legs of the girl from before Her eyes raise
higher and higher to where her face would be There is just
a crack a small space to see outside and for a second
Kristen can’t see anything at all

Then she sees the white plastic The red painted lips
Kristen slams the door when she comes to the doll like eyes
The face seems familiar like a cartoon Strawberry
Shortcake

She falls to the ground pushing against the door with all
her might as the rug she is using for leverage slips away on
the tile floor

She slides up against the side wall and moves towards the
living room knocking over the chair and the fire alarm

INT HOUSE - NIGHT

She runs towards the living room then to the parlor stopping

in front of the record player knocking the needle off the
record The house grows quiet

She runs to the window swinging the knife around towards the
empty room the windows and the door She waits

Suddenly there is a knock on the door and Kristen screams

Without thinking she breaks for the back hallway and the
bedrooms

INT BEDROOM —- NIGHT

She runs into the room and collapses near the night stand
trying to force herself under the bed She turns back
searching the hallway behind her for movement Then she
pushes her body against the bed

James’ candles fall on top of her from the night stand

Outside she hears screaming it sounds like someone is being
murdered outside the window and then it is silent

WOMEN (0S)
Pretty GirlPretty GirlPretty
Girl

Fingers begin tapping on the window Fingernails scrape
across the glass

Kristen cannot squeeze under the bed and as she tries her
dress tears down the side

WOMAN (0S)
Ssh Ssh

The glass stops vibrating

WOMAN (0S) (contd)
We know where you are

Kristen reaches up and pulls the lamp down from the table

It sits at her feet as she tries to turn off the light but
there is no switch She cuts into the shade needlessly with
the knife until finally she reaches in and breaks the bulb
with her hand The room grows dark except for the light from
the hallway

Outside the window she can hear the voices whispering and
then silence

There are knocks on the front door once then again Then
there is banging over and over while Kristen starts moaning
to herself pushing the knife out in front of her body

WOMAN (0S) (contd)
Who is it

Kristen stares at the window then towards the knocking
Then it stops

She sits on the floor her hands bleeding as she squeezes the
knife unconsciously She stares at the hallway and begins
crawling towards it the sound of crunching glass beneath her
knees

She hears a door open from the living room and freezes She
holds her breath as she listens to the movement in the other
room Her eyes are wide and she grips the knife even
tighter Her knuckles go white as her hand shakes
sporadically

The record player turns on again This time there is no
skip Kristen inches forward shooting glances at the window
and the hallway

The glass crackles under her legs

JAMES
Kristen

KRISTEN
Jimmy Jimmy Come here

INT HALLWAY —- NIGHT

She calls out in a scream whisper Too afraid to commit one
way or the other She pulls her legs over the old wood into
the hallway as more and more of the living room comes into
view

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

James comes out holding the broken top of the champagne
bottle and a plastic sack from the store He sees Kristen on
the ground and the bottle falls from his hands The back
door swings open through the curtain The noise causes him
to turn and look

He focuses back on Kristen confused by her appearance

JAMES
What are you

KRISTEN
There is someone out there

JAMES
What are you talking ab

Kristen crawls over to him grabbing desperately onto his
jacket He sees the blood on her hands and on the floor and
suddenly his eyes are as wide as hers

KRISTEN
--Shut up Shut up Come on

She pulls him toward the bedroom trying to get him to follow
her He turns and goes with her taking the knife from her
bleeding hand She sees the back door open and screams

JAMES
Baby

KRISTEN
They’re in here

JAMES
Kristen

James has to pick her up unsure as to what direction she now
wants to go

INT BEDROOM —- NIGHT

They rush into the bedroom and James sits her on the bed He
picks up the lamp and sets it on the table

JAMES
What happened

KRISTEN
I don’t know The girl She
wouldn’t stop knocking There’s
somebody out there I don’t know
what happened

He leans down to her wiping away the blood from her dress
She pushes past him and slams the door She tries to lock
it and then grabs a chair and attempts to lodge it in the
handle The chair is too small

KRISTEN (contd)
They might be in the house Help
me
JAMES
It’s okay Stop Stop How do
you know there’s somebody out
there

KRISTEN
I saw them

James stands up and walks towards the window
outside the curtains but sees nothing

JAMES
It’s probably kids You saw that
girl She couldn’t have been more

than 15

KRISTEN
It was aman I saw aman At the
window

JAMES

You saw him

KRISTEN
He was wearing a mask

JAMES
Wait

Kristen freezes James’ body tightens

KRISTEN
What is it

JAMES
Be quiet I see one A girl
She’s out there by the fence You
can see her outline Look

He

looks

Outside at the far end of the yard a girl stands next to
the fence It is too dark outside to see her face

Kristen rises from the bed and stands next to James at the

window

JAMES (contd)
What is she doing

KRISTEN
She’s watching us

Kristen walks away She lays back on the bed James stays
at the window staring out

JAMES
She’s just standing there She
knows I can see her

KRISTEN
James You can’t see the mask
She’s wearing a goddamn mask

JAMES
She looks like a ghost

KRISTEN
Don’t be stupid This is real
I’m not scared of fucking ghosts

JAMES
Maybe I should go and talk with
them
KRISTEN
They don’t want to talk
JAMES
Jesus calm down They want

something

James reaches inside his pocket Something is missing

KRISTEN
What is it
JAMES
I left my phone in the car
KRISTEN
Oh god
JAMES

Calm down You see what you’re
doing Stop I didn’t know I’m
gonna go out there and get it

KRISTEN
No

JAMES
Come on This is fucking crazy

He walks to the window

KRISTEN
Where’s she at

He scans back and forth searching everywhere in his sight
line

KRISTEN (contd)
Where is she at

JAMES
She’s gone
INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT
Kristen follows him but only to the foot of the door

JAMES
Stay here

She nods

KRISTEN
Gimmie the knife back

He goes to hand it to her but stops
JAMES

In a second
EXT PORCH - NIGHT
The front door creeks sticking slightly on its hinges before
James pulls it open For a second he pauses looking around
the empty yard
Outside it is quiet but a slow rumble fills the air
James slowly walks out onto the porch and then pulls the door
closed behind him Kristen’s face grows smaller and smaller

behind the crack until it is gone

He can hear the door lock behind him

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

James’ feet splash gently in the puddle left from the
champagne bottle and they leave a trail behind him as he
walks onto the grass in front of the house

His car sits a few feet away The windows are broken out and
the tires are slashed but the engine purrs The car is
running

James’ keys jangle loosely beside him his ignition key still
in his hand

JAMES
What (Whispers )

James takes a few steps further out into the yard He
circles in the grass checking all around him The knife is
extended out in his hand as he points it in all directions at
once

He walks closer to the car The engine grows louder as he
inches towards it The headlights shine out onto the wooden
fence beside the house

It is hard to see inside James crouches to his knees as he
approaches staring inside what is left of the side windows
The car is empty

He reaches inside the broken window feeling around for the
ignition The car is hot wired

He hears laughter from the darkness

WOMAN (0S)
Is Tamara home

The woman calls out from the street She is standing under a
street light 50 feet away James turns to her cautiously
He can barely see her in the light Her face is covered by
her hair

JAMES
What do you want

WOMAN
Is Tamara home

James takes a step closer She laughs

JAMES
Get the fuck away from here

In the darkness he can hear laughter again It is another
woman’s voice somewhere behind him James searches around
trying to find the source of the sound

He turns back to where the woman stood but she is gone He
can hear footsteps in the grass around him and then it is
silent

The car hums

INT PORCH —- NIGHT
Kristen peeks her head out the door She sees James

KRISTEN
James

JAMES
Go back inside

KRISTEN
Oh my god James what happened

JAMES
Go back inside

WOMAN (0S)
Go back inside

Kristen screams James opens the car door and feels around
the seats

JAMES
Kristen go I’m gonna find my
phone

She reluctantly closes the door James stares at the porch

WOMAN (0S)
Go back inside

He climbs inside the car The glass cracks underneath the
seats from the broken windshield He searches for his phone
his hands pull back every few seconds when he gets cut by a
piece of glass He stares out in front of the car to the
brightly lit fence in front of him The net from the
basketball goal is swinging in the wind

He puts the car in gear and it begins to creak along the
pavement The car rocks back and forth over the loose rubber
of the flat tires but it does not move

James struggles to put the car back in park He searches
again under the seats for his phone Outside the car he can
hear movement on the pavement

James panics He swings the knife out the window as his head
ducks down by the gear shift

He yells out to the house There is no response

JAMES
Kristen

Only the sound of the engine
He steps out of the car and leans down honking the horn

WOMAN (0S)
Go back inside

He turns around but no one is there

He honks again but keeps his eyes focused on the shadows
scanning the empty yard He looks back to the street where
the girl had been standing

James honks the horn one last time Turning his attention
back to the road he walks towards the street light

EXT STREET - NIGHT

The gravel under his feet crackles as he makes his way
towards the pool of light

He turns back to the porch every few steps to see if anyone
has come close to the door Then he shoots a glance towards
the car

Finally he reaches the street light

JAMES
Let me see you

Nothing James holds the knife up in he air like a trophy

JAMES (cont’d)
What do you want

The car idles

James looks down the long road towards the highway It is at
least a mile

James walks across the yard towards the front porch This
time the door is unlocked

INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

Inside the room is full of music James is on edge as he
walks towards the living room the knife extended out in
front of him

JAMES
Kristen

INT PARLOR - NIGHT

Kristen sits next to the record player her knees pulled up
to her chest

KRISTEN
James

JAMES
What are you doing

KRISTEN
I wanted to hear music Baby I’m
so scared

James drops the knife to his side relaxing
JAMES
I want you to get your things Put

your shoes on

Kristen lowers her eyes She stares out to the dining room
It is quiet The candles flicker

KRISTEN
They cut the phone lines

JAMES
What But you called me

KRISTEN
They cut the phones after

JAMES
Why didn’t you tell me

KRISTEN
It just happened All of it

JAMES
Where’s your phone

KRISTEN
They took it

JAMES
Are you fucking kidding me

He reaches over her ripping the needle off the record

JAMES (cont’d)
We have to get out of here

KRISTEN
We can’t go

JAMES
The car works

Outside the horn honks and the couple both freeze staring
towards the wall

KRISTEN
That’s what they want Do you hear
that They’re waiting

JAMES

I don’t give a good goddamn what
they want

INT DINING ROOM -—- NIGHT
James walks over and checks the back door behind him His
hands are shaking He stares down to them while his back is

turned to Kristen

JAMES
Let’s just go

She nods her head

EXT PORCH - NIGHT

The door opens and in an instant the honking stops James
and Kristen run out towards the car James swinging the knife
in all directions in the darkness

Silence

INT CAR - NIGHT
James reaches the driver’s side and Kristen the passenger

He throws the car in reverse and instantly the car lunges
backwards slowly moving towards the road Kristen searches
in each direction looking for signs of the strangers The
metal rims squeal on the concrete driveway

Then she sees the headlights on the road

KRISTEN
James Look

An old pickup truck speeds towards them as James continues to
try and force the car backwards

KRISTEN (cont’d)
James Honk the horn get their
attention

He sounds out the horn into the night again as the truck gets
closer and closer to the house

It slows to a stop in front of the driveway then turns
towards them

The back windshield still unbroken suddenly fills with
light and James throws the car in park

JAMES
Fucking thank God

He opens his door but then Kristen sees it She grips James
shoulder and he turns and sees the Man in the Mask standing
in the headlights a few feet in front of them

The car is suddenly dark and when Kristen turns around she
can see the driver She can see another mask

KRISTEN
Get out of the car

JAMES
What

James reacts just as the pickup truck slams into their rear
The car is thrust forward back to its original spot and
Kristen and James throw open their doors and run towards the
house

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

Neither the Man in the Mask nor the driver react But as
James enters the house he can hear the horn of the blue sedan
ring out in the night

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

Kristen collapses on the ground near their luggage James
falls against the wall Neither speak they are out of
breath

Kristen slides to the plastic bag James brought from the
store She pulls a cigarette from the bag and gets up
moving back into the dinning room to light it off the
candle Her hands are shaking blood drips on the table
cloth but she does not notice

INT DINNING ROOM —- NIGHT

James abruptly pulls a napkin from one of the place settings
and the silverware slams against the plates he had laid out
He grabs her hand softly and wipes away the blood before
wrapping the napkin around her wound

KRISTEN
She wouldn’t stop knocking I
should have left I could have
warned you

JAMES
Ssh This not your fault Don’t
think about it

For the next few minutes there is no action and for a
while there are no screams but outside the car keeps
honking Then it is silent

INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT

James walks over to the kitchen bringing back a jug of water
from the refrigerator He pours a glass for Kristen but he
drinks from the gallon himself

JAMES
Before I saw one of themnear
the highway When I was going to
get cigarettes I saw one

JAMES (cont d)
Not the girl on the porch She was

under one of the street lights as I
passed her It wasn’t the first
girl She was taller She hada
Halloween mask on Something like
a Pin Up girl

KRISTEN
That was the one driving the truck

JAMES
She was just on the road I didn’t
even really see her you know She
waved at me

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

Kristen stares at the water in the glass as she thinks about
what he has said A thick haze of smoke rises above their
heads

KRISTEN
They’re wearing masks

They sit in silence the situation sinking in

JAMES
They’re everywhere out there I
could hear them laughing

James says this to himself more than to Kristen They both
sit staring at the walls of the house listening

KRISTEN
What do they want Why are they
doing this to us

James looks out towards the windows He does not hear her
even though she is right in front of him

KRISTEN (contd)
James Jimmy

JAMES
It doesn’t matter

KRISTEN
Yes it does

He turns back to her His eyes piercing her face

JAMES
No it doesn’t Look at me Not
tonight Look at me Don’t think
about why okay They’re bad If
they come through this door again
all I will be thinking about is how
to get them the fuck out They’re
not like you

KRISTEN
That’s not good enough That’s not
a reason

JAMES

You don’t need a reason to be
afraid They won’t give us a
reason if they get inside

James puts the bottle between his feet and stands up At
first it seems like he is on a mission but then he trails
off stopping a few feet from the entry way

KRISTEN
What time is it

James does not respond He stares at the couch

KRISTEN (contd)
What times is it James

He looks at the back door again

He switches off the two lamps then walks over to the parlor
and the room goes dark

KRISTEN (cont’d)
What

JAMES
It’s my phone

KRISTEN
Where

James walks over to the couch and picks it up The battery
is missing He turns to Kristen

JAMES
They were in here again

KRISTEN
What are we going to do

Kristen stands up searching all around her He does not
answer her

INT HALLWAY —- NIGHT

They walk side by side down the hallway Kristen softly tugs
at James He looks up at her

JAMES
It’s alright

He squeezes her hand

INT BEDROOM —- NIGHT

They enter the room again Moving along the sides of the
wall as far out of the light as possible James flips off
the ceiling light and they crouch down listening

KRISTEN
We could climb out Maybe the
neighbors

JAMES
No one’s out here after the fall
The whole street is dead Most
people don’t even come out here
anymore

Outside they can hear the leaves crunching under the
strangers’ feet but they do not speak Then just silence
James steals quick glances over the window ledge

JAMES (cont’d)
I don’t see them

KRISTEN
Let’s check the other rooms
INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

James leads Kristen into the hall He peeks into the living
room Nothing has changed

Kristen opens the door to another bedroom and calls out to
James in a whisper

KRISTEN
I think I saw one James they’re
watching us They’re out there

JAMES
Close the door

He kneels down in the hallway She closes the door and leans
down over him He wraps his arm around her thigh

KRISTEN
What is it

JAMES
I haven’t heard a dog bark Ora
car pass They honked the horn for
at least a couple of minutes
Nothing Not since we’ve been
here It’s just us and them

She sits down close beside him James does not let go of her
leg

They sit in silence listening to the quiet house

JAMES (cont’d)
How’s your hand

She remembers her cuts and distractedly squeezes her homemade
bandage

KRISTEN
It hurts

JAMES
We should get up

KRISTEN
Okay

Neither one of them moves

KRISTEN (cont’d)
Wait Just for a second Just sit
here Please

She puts her head on James’ shoulder and closes her eyes
James rests his head back on the wall behind them letting
out a long slow breath

The wind picks up outside It blows the wind chimes outside
the windows

After a little while Kristen’s breath grows deeper as she
rests besides James James stares forward listening to the
house

FLASHBACK

INT HOTEL HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

James walks back and forth between two rooms His hands are
full of fast-food bags and drinks He stops himself from
knocking on one of the doors Unsure he pauses then
presses his ear against the door He backs away surveying
the two choices again

Then he knocks on both Kristen opens the door

JAMES
I couldn’t remember which was ours

KRISTEN
Youre a retard

She takes the drinks from him

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Kristen’s painted toes twist on the bathroom mat as she goes
to the bathroom The sink fills with water beside her She
stares into the large mirror beside her She looks
beautiful

Her high-heels rest on the ground in front of her

INT HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

James takes out the hamburgers and pours the french fries on
top of the bags The room is dark as the shades block out
the bright sunlight from outside Warm light mixes with the
cool of the television

James opens the closet and pulls out the rental bag for his
tuxedo He takes his shirt off and walks over to the
bathroom

INT BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Kristen stands in front of the mirror touching up her makeup

JAMES (0S)
Are you okay

He calls through the door
KRISTEN
Yeah Just a second
INT HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON
James walks over to the dresser pulling open one of the
drawers He shoots a quick glance at the bathroom door

again His hands feel inside before Kristen can walk through
the door When she walks out he is already on the bed

KRISTEN
Were you waiting

JAMES
Yeah

KRISTEN

Thanks You didn’t have to
They sit down in front of the TV on the edge of the bed
Kristen puts on a robe she brings from the closet
INT HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

They sit and watch television while they eat in silence

INT HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

James stands up and walks over to the window peeking through
a crack

JAMES
Can I open them

KRISTEN
Yeah

JAMES

It’s just that it is dark in here

KRISTEN
It’s okay I don’t care

The room fills with bright almost overwhelming light
Kristen lays back on the bed Reaching for her cigarettes
James changes clothes as they listen to the advertisements
for PAY PER VIEW

Kristen watches him as he stands in the mirror slowly
turning himself into a gentleman

JAMES
Time to get up

KRISTEN
I don’t wanna

She pouts like a little girl

JAMES
We gotta

KRISTEN
Fine

She stands up next to him in front of the mirror and drops
her robe

JAMES
Good enough to eat

Kristen walks away and James slaps her on the ass

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

She does some last minute touch ups in the bathroom

INT HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON
James makes his way to the dresser again
He opens the drawer and pulls out a small ring case shoving

it in his pocket Kristen walks in as he straightens the
bed

KRISTEN

Are you ready Freddie
JAMES

Yeah
KRISTEN

Last chance to stay and get naked

JAMES
Don’t toy with me woman

He turns off the TV then switches it back on

JAMES (contd)
I want to rent this sometime

KRISTEN
Sure

They both look at the mirror one last time Then James turns
and faces her She straightens his tie

INT HOTEL HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
They walk down the empty hallway Kristen grabs James’ hand

FLASHBACK ENDS

INT HALLWAY —- NIGHT

James touches the side of Kristen’s face but she remains
still His hand moves across her face her lips and
eventually her breathing changes and she takes a deep gentle
gasp Her eyes flicker for a few seconds until she opens
them

JAMES
Baby

Kristen nods still out of it

They both stare towards the ceiling Neither one speaks nor
looks in the others’ direction

Kristen reaches over and tugs at James’ hand He rolls his
head over and they lock eyes For a moment they seem to
communicate without words

JAMES (contd)
Let’s do it quick

KRISTEN
I’m sorry

JAMES
I have to go too

They get up slowly the weight of their bodies causing loud
shifts on the hard wood floors They crawl towards one of
the open doorways

Kristen enters first James follows the knife sliding on
the ground in front of him

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kristen does not bother to turn the light on as she
approaches the toilet James sits by the door guarding it
as Kristen finishes

She kneels down by the sink James does not rush her

JAMES
I should have asked you a long time
ago It shouldn’t have taken this
long

KRISTEN
It doesn’t matter

JAMES
It matters to me If I hadn’tI
was scared I liked your Mom

KRISTEN
Why did you have to wait I
wantedI needed you to ask me

JAMES
You should have told me
KRISTEN
James
JAMES

I wish you would have told me

He watches her bare feet slide across the tile Her toe
nails blood red against the smooth white ground

Kristen stares up at the light on the ceiling The faucet
drips once then again A spider has made a web above them

KRISTEN
I’m lying

JAMES
What What do you mean
KRISTEN
James I can’t I don’t want to
talk about this now

James does not move He does not say a word

hangs above them

Kristens

KRISTEN (cont’d)
It was too late Even then I
didn’t think about it until now I
didn’t think about it But I know
it was

JAMES
What are you saying

KRISTEN
That day when my momwhen she
died My dad called remember It
was a Saturday We were going to
lunch He called and I went into
the bedroom and he told me I
remember falling to my knees and
the way the weight felt against my
bare skin It burned I was
kneeling on the ground holding the
phone in my right hand and looking
at my knees

The silence

Eventually Kristen speaks again

hand floats in the hair beside her face

KRISTEN (contd)
But for a minute I didn’t call for
you

She clears her throat James is still

KRISTEN (cont’d)
My dad was talking telling me
about a plane ticket I can
remember the sound of his voice
but not the words You know Just
his voice I just stared down at my
knee You came in after a few more
seconds and when you put your arms
around me it felt good
But I didn’t need it the way I
thought I would I didn’t call for
you The way I thought should

James stares down the hallway Then he locks eyes with
Kristen

JAMES
I don’t know what to say

KRISTEN
Neither do I

INT HALLWAY —- NIGHT

On the roof above them they hear a footstep At first it
almost sounds like thunder but then as the second and third
rattle the ceiling the sound becomes clear to them both

Kristen joins James in standing as they both gape at the
ceiling Their eyes follow the footsteps as someone walks
across the top of the house

KRISTEN
How many are up there
JAMES
It could be one I don’t know

Maybe two

A loud pounding begins to rumble on the roof James ducks
his head without thinking It seems right above them

JAMES (cont’d)
What do they want us to do

KRISTEN
James I don’t want to wait for
them to come through that door
I’m scared

JAMES
It’1l be bright outside soon

KRISTEN
No it won’t We have at least an
hour They know that

JAMES
We could go for the car Try and
make it down the road It might be
our only chance

KRISTEN
What if it’s not

JAMES
Then we’re going to die in here
Or there Or maybe they’1ll go
away Or maybe they won’t But
this way we have a chance to get
out

Above them the footsteps rain down like a hail storm

JAMES (contd)
We have to try Can you run

KRISTEN
I can make it

JAMES
We just have to go Whatever
happens listen to me just go

She nods her head and they walk into the living room

INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

Then they move down the dark hall towards the door James
cracks it open and looks outside He can hear the engine
running but the car is out of view

He closes the door softly and whispers to Kristen

JAMES
I don’t know if they’re out there

KRISTEN
We should try

James’ hand rests on the door handle With a gentle nudge
the door clicks closed

KRISTEN (cont’d)
James

JAMES
Yeah

KRISTEN
They’ve stopped moving up there

She looks towards the ceiling The house is eerily quiet

JAMES
I’m just gonna throw the door open
Then you run

She stares at the ceiling James turns the knob of the door

JAMES (contd)
Kristen

She snaps out of her trance and looks towards the door

JAMES (cont’d)
Are you ready

KRISTEN
No

JAMES
We have to go

KRISTEN
Give me a second Just wait

Her eyes wander around the house She moves back towards the
living room and searches the walls

KRISTEN (contd)
They want us to come this way
They know we’ll try

JAMES
Maybe we can make it

She stares past him to the front door almost looking past
it

KRISTEN

Does your father have a gun
JAMES

No
KRISTEN

He has to he he kills things

She motions to the deer mounted on the wall in the living
room

JAMES
He bought those things Those
heads They came with the house

KRISTEN
He has to

She stares at the dead animals

JAMES
Not since I was a boy

KRISTEN
Whered he keep it

James walks past her into the living room

JAMES
Fuck maybe he does

As James looks around at the walls his tone changes

JAMES (contd)
Holy shit we could fucking
shoot’em

KRISTEN
Think

Again footsteps pound above them and they both look up at
the ceiling

JAMES
Let’s go to the bedroom I think
he hid it in the bedroom

They both move towards the back bedrooms James picks the
knife up from ground by the front door and casts a few
glances over his shoulder as he follows Kristen out of the
room

INT HALLWAY —- NIGHT

They move down the hall at a snail’s pace both now holding
knives as they walk back into the darkness

The steps on the roof resume but have become more sporadic
They hit hard and fast every few seconds and then they are
gone

INT BEDROOM —- NIGHT

Broken glass cracks under the weight of James’ rented shoes
as he brushes away the shards so that Kristen can walk
inside

James opens the folding doors of the closet Kristen stops
him with her hand motioning around the room

KRISTEN
Listen They’re talking about us
I bet they can see us through the
windows

INT CLOSET - NIGHT

He tugs at the cord inside the walk-in closet and the hanging
bulb comes to life

James digs through the clothes pushing back boxes until he
finds what he is searching for He pulls the gun out from
behind the clothes and shows it to Kristen like a prize

JAMES
It’s still here He was gonna sell
it
Kristen nods moving over to the door of the room and looking

down the hall

James goes back to digging in the bottom of the closet
carelessly knocking things over

INT HALLWAY —- NIGHT

It is silent inside the house Kristen looks down the
hallway at the overturned chair lying on the ground The
fire alarm still resting beside it

A loud slam rocks the ceiling and she almost lets out a
scream but she catches herself covering her mouth with her
hand She runs back inside the room and finds James on his
knees looking through shoe boxes

INT CLOSET - NIGHT

JAMES
What was it

KRISTEN
Nothing What are you doing

JAMES
He used to hide the bullets We
always had to find them

Finally a pink box made for women’s shoes rattles in James
hand

He drops the top and pulls out a pile of remaining shells
He slides the gun into his lap and tries to load it but he
cannot open the barrel

KRISTEN
What is it

JAMES
I’ve never used this I haven’t
even seen a gun in 5 years

There is no sound from the roof above James sits on his
knees holding the shotgun in his lap Kristen stands behind
him Her hand resting on his shoulder

JAMES (contd)
I don’t know how to use this

KRISTEN
You said you used to hunt with
your dad

JAMES

I didn’t It was just something I
said My dad hated
huntingkilling things

I mean I knew my way around when I
used to go camping

He squeezes the handle in his hands

JAMES (contd)
My friends in college It was
just something I said I just said
I could when we would talk

KRISTEN
At least we have it

JAMES
If I fire a shot maybe they’1l
just go away

James stands up but his legs seem weak at first until he
leans on the wall

KRISTEN
James

JAMES
It’s a gun

KRISTEN
What

JAMES
It’s a gun

KRISTEN
James

JAMES

Nothing Nothing I’m just tired
They walk out moving towards the living room the shells
still in James’ hand
INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT
He kneels in front of the living room trying to open the gun

KRISTEN
We have to go

JAMES
I know Gimmie a second Wait

The first strike against the door sounds like little more
than a knock

James and Kristen slam against the wall Staring at the
door

The second blow sends a small piece of wood the size of a
roll of quarters past them onto the hard wood floor where it
rattles against the couch

With the third crash James grabs Kristen by the shoulder
and moves her away from the entry way and the front door

INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

The door shakes again and again as an axe begins to slice
through it James can see the smiley face in the front porch
light as the Man in the Mask winds over and over and strikes
the front door

He pauses staring at James and Kristen the mask filling the
hole They can hear him breathing through the door

JAMES
We have to find something We have
to block the door

KRISTEN
Get away from here Go away
JAMES
Kristen
INT LIVING ROOM -—- NIGHT

He tosses the gun on the ground and Kristen joins him at the
piano as he begins pushing it towards the entry way

JAMES
Push as hard as you can

A side table near their bags gets knocked over and James
picks it up in one motion and tosses it over the couch It
crashes down through the glass table but neither one seems
to notice

JAMES (contd)
Keep going

The piano scrapes against the wall as the ax slices into the
front door

JAMES (contd)
We have to get block it
INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT
The thick door is torn to shreds by the time they get there

James slams the end of the piano against what is left as the
Man in the Mask reaches for the lock

KRISTEN
James

The blade pushes through the door into the piano letting out
a loud rumble that vibrates throughout the large instrument
James continues to push as the piano slides back and forth
between the men Finally it stops moving

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

James returns to the living room almost knocking Kristen
down as he grabs an arm chair and throws it towards the entry
way hall

Again the piano moans but this time no sound follows
Kristen watches the hole in the front door searching for the
ghostly smile James continues to grab random objects
tossing them past her towards the door

He picks up the gun and slaps it like a child trying to get
it to work Kristen moves in close beside him but he does
not notice her He is in a trance like state his eyes
never leaving the door

She pulls the gun out of his hands and searches for a switch
anything that might make the gun accessible

Finally with the flip of a knob the barrel opens and
Kristen clumsily shoves two of the shells into the weapon
James turns to her and pulls the gun back into his own hands
He is shaking and Kristen retreats shocked at his behavior

KRISTEN
God What are you doing

He sticks the remaining shells in his pocket and turns
towards the door tossing one last book towards the doorway

KRISTEN (contd)
He’s gone James he’s gone

JAMES
No he’s not

KRISTEN
Stop it

He fires a shot at the hole Both he and Kristen stumble
back from the force of the blast

KRISTEN (contd)
Stop it

She fights him momentarily as he tries to throw their bags
down the hall James hits both knees gasping for air

Kristen falls back against the wall staring at the hole in
the door The gun tumbles out of his hand onto the ground

James glances at the back door

JAMES

This is real This is real
KRISTEN

Baby
JAMES

Don’t call me that
For a second his attention comes back to her

KRISTEN
I’m sorry

James kicks the wall

Then he grabs the gun and pushes her towards the back
hallway

KRISTEN (contd)
What are you doing

JAMES
Fuck this

He turns and yells towards the door

JAMES (cont’d)
Fuck you

INT STUDY - NIGHT

James walks around in the dark and begins preparing With a
loud crash he tosses a book shelf over and the ground is
suddenly covered in books broken picture frames and
trophies

Kristen climbs over the pile using James’ arm as a guide and
they both crouch down behind it He slides the barrel of the
gun back and forth along the shelf until finally resting it
to aim directly at the door

James has grown quiet He seems distanced as he stares
behind the barrel of the gun

KRISTEN
Are you okay

JAMES
I won’t die here We’ll sit here
till the fucking cops come or
whatever But I won’t fucking die

A grandfather clock sits in the darkness just beyond the
light shining in from the hallway The sound of ticking
overshadows their nervous breathing as they wait for
something to happen

James opens the barrel dropping in a shell and loading
another one and closes it He opens and closes it again
just double checking

EXT STREET - NIGHT

At first in the darkness there are only footsteps and then
a soft metallic clink

Under a street light an OLD MAN walks in the early morning
He wears an old fishing cap deep on his brow his pants hang
just above his bright white tennis shoes

He passes by mailboxes and streetlights and then nothing but
the open fields between houses He is half the distance to
the house with blue Saturn This part of the street is still
quiet

Every so often there is the sound of the metal against the
old ground And footsteps

In his hand he carries a worn down putter He uses it as a
cane but he does not need one He is still strong The
metal bounces off the sidewalk every couple of feet or so as
he walks his pace quick and determined

INT STUDY - NIGHT

James lies on his stomach his eyes focused on the doorway in
front of him

Kristen lies beside him staring at the wall in darkness The
only sound is the grandfather clock ticking in the corner

KRISTEN
James

He doesn’t reply

EXT STREET - NIGHT

The old man is about three houses down when he sees the
battered four-door in the parking lot of the house At
first it is too far to see clearly but it has caught his
attention

When he gets to the same street light where the woman had
stood he can hear the car running He stands under the
light staring at the strange sight

In the shadows next to the house a white mask hovers near
the windows The old man does not see it as he approaches
the house slowly The putter is quiet now the soft sound
blending with the footsteps as he crosses the yard

When he reaches the porch he can still see the footsteps
James had left earlier in the grass He gazes at the car for
a few seconds and then reaches over and pushes the doorbell
He curiously investigates the damage on the wood in front of
him

He stands waiting for a response but after a few seconds he
walks around the side of the house to the car and the bright
head lights

In the bright lights he pauses in front of the hood the
engine still humming

He walks towards the fence and opens it with a slight tug
entering the back yard

The back door is open and he walks in without hesitating

In the field another mask is watching

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

The old man walks past the table the putter leading the way
as the sound vibrates on the hardwood floor Every few
seconds he pauses staring at the destroyed room

He picks up the phone on the bar and listens to the dead air
Then he pulls a cell phone out of his pocket and holds it at
his side

INT STUDY - NIGHT

James tightens as they listen to the sound of the putter
slapping against the ground Kristen squeezes the leg of
James’ pants

INT HALLWAY —- NIGHT

The old man walks past the spot on the floor where James and
Kristen were a few minutes ago and then passes the bathroom

He fades deeper and deeper into darkness as he moves to the
bedrooms and the sound of the putter echoes louder and louder
until finally silence

The sound of a grandfather clock tics in the darkness as he
stares into an open door

OLD MAN
Hello

A gunshot flickers in the room and the sound is deafening
The putter and the man hit the ground at the same time Like
that it is over

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Kristen lies on her side her head pressed tight against the
overturned bookshelf She holds her ringing ears as she

stares at James’ hand still squeezing the trigger

Neither one of them moves James stares forward at the feet
that lay on the floor

The wall behind the body seems wet like it just rained a
dark liquid

JAMES
I hit someone

He says this almost in a whisper

JAMES (contd)
Kristen I shot somebody

She looks up at him from the ground

JAMES (cont’d)
Do you hear me
KRISTEN
I hear you

JAMES
I shot the man

KRISTEN
What’s he doing

JAMES
I think he’s dead

James rolls over leaving the gun against the bookshelf
lies back next to Kristen trembling

James coughs almost gagging He can’t seem to stop
The clock ticks on the wall beside them

KRISTEN
They won’t bother us anymore

JAMES
I fuckin’ shot him

KRISTEN
We can just wait here now

James nods his head over and over his eyes closed
JAMES
I hit him in the face He walked
right into it Right where I was
aiming He just walked into

KRISTEN
Did you see his mask

JAMES
What

He is still His eyes are closed

KRISTEN
Did you see his mask

JAMES
Just shut up

He

She rolls over and stares at the feet of the man The golf

club lies beside his legs

KRISTEN
I’m so sorry

JAMES
Be quiet

James opens his eyes and stares at the wall The room is
quiet the ticking clock the only sound

The room suddenly fills with noise as the clock strikes 5 in
the morning James and Kristen both jump at the sound
James reaches for the gun on impulse and then they both just
listen as the bells clamor five times

Then they stop and just the ticking echoes through the room
again

JAMES (contd)
I shot him

KRISTEN
It’s okay

She reaches over to him and without thinking he slides away
towards the wall

JAMES
He didn’t wear one

He leans up and turns facing the man

JAMES (contd)
He didn’t have a mask

KRISTEN
What

James gets to his knees then slowly he climbs past the
bookshelf leaving the gun as he heads towards the door

A pool of blood has formed around the body and it rolls
towards James The floor is slanted

James’ hand slides out from underneath him and he catches
himself on the door frame He leaves a bloody hand print
near the light switch

KRISTEN (contd)
Come back

James ignores her leaning his head through the door frame
It is hard to see in the hallway but as James hovers over
the body it becomes clear to him that this is an old man

KRISTEN (cont’d)
James

JAMES
Just shut up

His tone is cruel Kristen crawls towards him Her hand
touching the back of his shoulder He pushes her away
without even looking her direction

Instead his eyes are focused on the body underneath him
The old man’s hand grips the unseen phone inches away from
James’ leg

Kristen starts to cry behind him

KRISTEN
Answer me

JAMES
It’s not him

KRISTEN
How do you know

JAMES
Give me the gun

KRISTEN
How do you know

On the roof above him they hear a footstep
James turns back to her

JAMES
Give me the gun

KRISTEN
No

He leaps upon her and throws her to the ground

JAMES
I remember him I’ve seen him
before Do you understand Do
you

He presses his weight against Kristen She is crying
screaming James cries as well

KRISTEN
Get off me

Her tone is unsympathetic She is becoming angry

JAMES
I killed a man

KRISTEN
Don’t touch me

James pulls off of her and falls on the ground beside her
They both cry in the darkness The clock ticks beside them
On the roof they hear another footstep

KRISTEN (contd)
It is not your fault

JAMES
I pulled the trigger

KRISTEN
Youcan’tDon’t think

JAMES
What do you want to say There is
nothing I did it they made me
Oh fuck I might go to jail

Kristen reaches over to him

KRISTEN
You won’t go

JAMES
There’s no one here I killed an
old man No one else He lived on
this street

She tries to grab him hug him
JAMES (contd)
Don’t touch me I shouldn’t be
touched

He pulls away from her and stands up She follows him wiping
her runny nose

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

There is a nervous energy building as they approach the
dining room The candles on the tables are now half melted
James runs his fingers through the flames over and over

He walks towards the curtains

JAMES
I have to find them

KRISTEN
Don’t leave me alone in here What
are you talking about

JAMES
I don’t know what to do They’re
out there fucking laughing
Goddamn it

KRISTEN
What if somebody’s in here

He is red in the face Sweat builds on his forehead

JAMES
I want you to hide I don’t want
to argue

James reaches into the curtain and opens the door then he
pushes the gun barrel into the night sky He fires a shot
out the door The force shoves him back a bit but he holds
his position

His frustration builds as he attempts to open the gun and
reload Again he slaps at the metal

JAMES (contd)
Goddammit

The barrel suddenly complies and clicks open James slides
two shells in and snaps the gun closed

He pulls back the curtain and sees the window of the door
clearly this time

He stumbles back running into the dining room table and then
rolls off it onto the ground

The gun crashes to the floor Kristen screams as James picks
up the gun and swings it towards the back door

Written in lipstick on the window pane is
KILLER

James slams the door and pulls the curtain back over the
window Kristen screams again

JAMES
Just go and hide

He pulls the corner of the curtain aside and peeks out again

KRISTEN
Don’t leave me in here

She grabs a hold of him squeezing him in her arms pleading
with him

KRISTEN (contd)

Don’t go

JAMES
Let go Do it

KRISTEN
Please

JAMES

There’s a barn outside Do you see
it There’s a barn We used to
have a 4 wheeler Maybe it’s still
out there If I’m not backjust
go there if I don’t come back

He pulls away from her and she falls to the ground He yanks
the door open through the curtain and runs outside Kristen
follows him but stops on the porch

KRISTEN
James

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT
She watches James run away from her and into the black night

His feet are like bricks as he crosses the damp grass
carrying the heavy gun With each step away from the house
he falls further into darkness He swings the barrel in
every direction at once as he searches the shadows around
him

Only his feet on the grass give any perspective to where he
is He turns back looking at the house to where Kristen
stands on the porch staring out at him

Then he turns the corner of the partial fence that separates
the backyard from the acres surrounding the house and
disappears

EXT BACK PORCH —- NIGHT
Kristen does not go any further

It is cold outside and she shivers as she struggles to see
any sign of James or the strangers Her body dances from
side to side the concrete cold against her feet

The wind chimes blow harder than ever before in the night
breeze

Off the side of the house a ragged American flag swings in

the darkness It rattles against its cheap aluminium pole

trying to escape Kristen’s eyes are drawn to it Then she
looks towards the black field in front of her

She can hear James’ footsteps from behind the fence she
tries to whisper to him but after a couple of tries she
just listens

She hears a footstep on the roof and retreats but her foot
catches the edge of the doorway She stumbles slightly
grabbing the curtain for support as she falls inside

FLASHBACK

INT HOTEL - NIGHT

The curtains near the balcony blow in the gentle breeze
passing through the open window A security light outside
casts a green glow throughout the back of the room that
slightly touches the edge to the bed

James is asleep His back faces Kristen who stares at the
ceiling above her

KRISTEN
James

She whispers It is barely noticeable

KRISTEN (cont’d)
James

He opens his eyes not sure of what he has heard He stares

at the window listening

KRISTEN (contd)
Are you awake

JAMES
Yeah

KRISTEN
I had a bad dream

She sits up slightly and tries to see over his shoulder
eyes are closed again

KRISTEN (cont’d)
James

JAMES
Yeah Yes Are you okay

His

He can hear her hands moving around the night stand A glass
bumps into the base of the lamp His keys slide across the

wood falling onto the carpet below

Kristen lights a cigarette

James turns over on his back and they both stare up at the

ceiling

JAMES (contd)
What time is it

KRISTEN
500

JAMES
You should sleep

KRISTEN
I want to but not now

James is drifting his eyes grow heavy and close then he
fights them back open

JAMES
What was your dream about

KRISTEN
I don’t remember I mean I know
you were in it There was a
monster

JAMES
We should get you a dreamcatcher
Something to protect you

KRISTEN
What’s that

JAMES
I don’t know I can’t remember
Hippies keep them

James takes a drink of his water then reaches and grabs the
cigarette from the ashtray she has rested on her chest

KRISTEN
You shouldn’t do that
JAMES
I’m not
He takes a drag
KRISTEN

I’m a bad influence

JAMES
Youre the only influence But
it’s fine Just with you That’s
the only time I smoke anymore

She takes the cigarette back gently and takes a drag
exhaling slowly

KRISTEN
It’s so quiet here No one is
walking around

JAMES
That’s why I like hotels At
night you walk around the halls
and you can feel the world around
you sleeping Nobody moves

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

James and Kristen walk down the long hallway James wears
just his pants and carries the ice bucket loosely in his
hand Kristen wears a robe and has her hair pulled up on top
of her head

KRISTEN
It’s so cold

JAMES
Just think about the bed It’s
warm in the bed

KRISTEN
Cant this wait til tomorrow

JAMES
I’m thirsty I need ice We could
be sleeping

They reach the ice machine The silence is broken by the
sound of ice knocking against the bottom of the bucket The
rumble of the machine fills the quiet halls around them

Kristen gets a candy bar from the machine while she waits

KRISTEN
I need to get fatter anyway

JAMES
Shut up Quit talking about my
girlfriend

James’ tone is not sympathetic It is more annoyed

KRISTEN
I’m a fatty

JAMES
Oh my god Please Shut up I’m
not going to argue with you at 530
in the morning I won’t do it

KRISTEN
Fine

JAMES
Youre fucking beautiful

They walk back towards their room She clomps along next to
him wearing his oversized shoes

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

James sits on the floor near the window Kristen eats her
candy bar in the bed

KRISTEN
Come back

JAMES
I will I just wanna see the sun
It’s about to come up over there
I haven’t seen a sunrise since
college

Kristen grabs a cigarette James watches the flame flicker
as she lights it in the darkness They both are content to
sit for a moment to wait for the sun

Kristen watches the smoke rise above her and filter out the
balcony door

KRISTEN
Come back to bed

JAMES
I will Just a second

James gazes at the light growing brighter on the horizon

JAMES (cont’d)
Are you happy

KRISTEN
Sometimes

JAMES
That’s not enough

KRISTEN
I don’t think I can try any harder

JAMES
I’1l help you

KRISTEN
You can’t

JAMES
I will

KRISTEN
You can’t

James’ skin grows brighter every second now Kristen remains
in the darkness

JAMES
I love you

Kristen is silent

KRISTEN
I know

Kristen coughs then takes a drag

FLASHBACK ENDS

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

From where Kristen sits next to the doorway she can see the
outline of the barn through the curtain A small light
shines on the side of the tin building

She turns back to the living room The hole in the front
door whistles in the wind

Her hands reach across the table behind her until she grabs a
hold of the cigarettes and James’ matches She lights one
and breathes deeply letting her smoke blow out onto the
porch in front of her

A cat sits a hundred feet away from her in the yard She
watches its glassy eyes stare back at her It is calm but
its ears rotate around taking in the little noises of the
outdoors

On the roof Kristen hears the familiar pounding of
footsteps but her eyes never leave the cat She
unconsciously swivels the ring around her finger

A scream from a woman is heard from the direction James ran
earlier

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

The cat takes off for the fields and Kristen runs out after
James Her cigarette drops to the concrete as her bare feet
slap across the pavement and then disappear in the tall
grass

She cannot see James but in the distance she can make out
the shadow of the barn at the end of the property She can
hear someone behind the fence as she approaches Then she
hears a man’s voice that is not like James’ She turns for
the barn

The house grows smaller behind her as she pushes closer to
the tin building The sound of footsteps suddenly appear
from the side of her as she runs

Kristen turns around and sees the outline of someone backlit
by the porch as they are fast approaching her

She turns around and her feet catch on a hole in the earth
She slams into the ground

The wind is knocked out of her and for a moment Kristen
lies on the grass gasping She is still half way to the
barn

Kristen rolls over and tries to stand but she collapses back
down again The footsteps behind her have stopped She can
only hear her own breathing Kristen’s hands reach for her
ankle

She faces back towards the house and sees a flash as a
gunshot rings out in the night

The shadow of one of the girls darts across the windows of
the back porch The girl runs towards the side of the house
where the gunshot appeared

Kristen gets to her knees and frantically looks around for
signs of someone chasing her She begins crawling slowly
towards the barn

Pits in the earth the size of hoof prints tear at her skin
as she pulls her body towards the barn door She is hurt and
with her every move her face grimaces in pain

Behind her the other woman walks fifty feet away As they
approach the light on the barn it reveals her mask a
fifties PIN UP GIRL

She makes no effort to catch Kristen She pauses with
Kristen’s every stop and then walks when Kristen moves
forward

EXT BARN —- NIGHT

Kristen reaches the barn door as the woman trails behind her
Kristen glances back and sees her but before Kristen can
open her mouth the Pin Up Girl screams for her

She comes closer and closer the dead eyes staring into
Kristen a shrieking voice coming from a mouth that does not
move

When she is a foot away from Kristen she stops Kristen is
turned on her back her hands covering her face and body
Her dress is in rags For a second they both just stop
waiting

The Pin Up Girl turns back listening towards the house She
is excited her chest heaving with every quick breath She
runs back towards the house disappearing out of the circle
of light from the barn

Kristen turns toward the door The handle is high and she
has to lean up against the metal walls to reach it Both her
hands grab the rust covered door and with all her might she
attempts to wedge it open

After a few pulls the door has budged just enough for her to
slide her torso through the hole By kicking her legs she
drags the rest of her body through

INT BARN - NIGHT

Inside it is pitch black Kristen finds a flashlight and
shines it along the cobwebbed covered walls The space is
more like a storage closet than anything else Stacks of
boxes and broken down equipment litter the floors She finds
the 4 wheeler but it has long since died a slow death

The wheels are flat and the engine is stolen It lies ina
heap Even the steering wheel is gone

She slides back to the door searching the area around the
house

Everything is still and quiet

She leans against the metal door and turns the flashlight to
the back of the barn As the light passes around the room
she discovers an orange glow coming from the back wall She
gets to her knees and slowly hoists herself to her feet
making her way past an old riding lawn mower and some weed-
eaters as she shuffles to the faint light

Against the wall is a small work table On top of it sits
an old HAM radio

Kristen picks up the receiver and adjusts the volume The
room fills with static and she turns back to the barn door
afraid that someone has heard her

KRISTEN
Hello Is anyone there

She presses the button this time

KRISTEN (contd)
Hello Somebody

The room fills with static

KRISTEN (contd)
Hello Help me

She drops the receiver moving so she can see through the
door

RADIO
Hello

Kristen is startled by the sound and she slams into various
pieces of metal and trash desperately reaching for the
receiver

KRISTEN
Hello Wait wait

She hobbles back to the radio pulling the cord from the
ground The static halts

KRISTEN (cont’d)
Hello Can you hear me There’s

kill us You have to help me

The room fills with static as Kristen starts crying Her
hands are shaking as she continues to hold the microphone to
her face

KRISTEN (contd)

Static

RADIO
Sweetheart I want you to think
You gotta know where you are

Outside the barn she can hear screams from the house A
woman’s voice Kristen stares at the doorway The beam of
the flashlight shakes against the wall near the door The
static goes in waves from loud to softer but continues in
jarring bursts breaking the silence

Kristen pulls at her hair her body convulsing She says
James’ name over and over to herself

RADIO (contd)
I can help you

KRISTEN
I’m gonna go There’s no time
I’m gonna go

She slams her hands against the wooden table The radio
bounces up and down on the warped wood

RADIO
Are you there Kristen

She hears a scream again then nothing

KRISTEN
I’m sorry

RADIO
I can help you

Kristen flips the radio off Silence fills the barn

She collides with an old air conditioner and falls forward
losing the flashlight The light fades and she is left in
the darkness

KRISTEN
James

She gropes her way to the barn door She grips the side of
it as she makes her way outside again crawling back towards
the house

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

Kristen inches away from the light and away from the path
that leads to the house The brush is high and her body
disappears into the thorns and weeds

She sees James for a moment as he leaves the porch heading
back into the yard He is limping and he seems disoriented
but he still holds the gun He calls out into the night air

JAMES
Kristen

She tries to scream but no words form Just over the high
grass a hundred yards away she can see the Pin Up Girl
searching near the trees She lowers her head trying to
hide

James does not see the light reflecting off the white mask as
it seemingly floats in the blackness Kristen is frozen

He runs back into the house and after a few moments he
emerges with a red gas can in one hand and the gun in the
other Without a glance in Kristen’s direction he kicks
open the gate and moves towards the blue Saturn

EXT DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

His movements are rushed and chaotic as he rips the cap off
the can and begins pouring the gas over the car

JAMES
You know what I did All of you

He opens the car door and searches for matches

JAMES (cont’d)
Just leave us alone

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

Kristen tries to crawl towards him but her eyes continue to
fall back to the Pin Up Girl The stranger’s body becomes
more visible as she walks slowly towards the house Kristen
can see the reflection of the blade in her hand as the knife
hits the light

The Pin Up Girl sees James through the gate She is moving
towards him

EXT DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

James finds a Bic lighter and scrapes it over and over with
his thumb trying to produce a flame He moves to the trunk
and then suddenly the lighter strikes

He is shaky as he holds it against the blue metallic paint
but after his second attempt the gasoline catches and the
body of the car is devoured by orange and gold

EXT BACKYARD - NIGHT

Kristen spots the Man in the Mask as he appears from the
shadows near the opposite side of the house She scans the
darkness searching for another stranger somewhere around
her

Just out of her view Strawberry watches her

Pin Up Girl and the Man walk slowly and cautiously towards
each other as they move nearer to James They speak to each
other in a whisper that Kristen cannot make out across the
yard

Soon they connect near the porch both heading for James as
he watches the car burn He is in his own world

KRISTEN
James

She screams her body lifting up over the grass

The Man in the Mask never takes his eyes off the opening in
the gate as he walks closer and closer towards James

Kristen watches him disappear behind the wooden fence She
hears the gas can slam against the pavement but both James
and the Man are out of sight

The Pin Up Girl turns around

Her plastic eyes scan the open field She walks back out
into the grass past the patio A small rubber ball squishes
underneath her worn down shoes letting out a small squeak

Kristen buries her face in the grass and the mud and listens
She tries to hold her breath as she hears the grass around
her beaten down by the Pin Up Girl’s footsteps With every
other one there is a swoosh of the blade against the tall
grass

A gunshot rings out but she doesn’t look up There is no
sound of the stranger now Kristen waits

The Pin Up Girl rushes past her and then disappears inside
the barn

Kristen listens to her footsteps grow fainter and then hears
something slam against the metal of the barn’s walls She
searches the yard and then looks through the barn door

It is dark like a black hole She cannot make out anything
going on inside so she shifts her focus back to the burning
car

She pulls herself up and moves towards the fire Strawberry
continues to watch her

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

Kristen is weak and every attempt to slide her body forward
produces little to no movement Eventually she enters the
grassy area of the yard and finally her hands touch the
concrete of the porch

She stares at the fire but it will not last The flames are
dying out The car will not burn much longer

Her skin and the fabric of the dress are worn away by the
harshness of the ground beneath her She is almost
unrecognizable and her frail body is drained of all its
energy

INT DINING ROOM -—- NIGHT
Kristen throws herself through the doorway falling on the
wood floor coughing and crying as the sweat drips from her

forehead

She lies on her back one hand swinging to grab the curtain

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

She pushes the curtain open straining to see outside She
can see the silhouette of the Pin Up Girl moving away from
the barn and then the woman disappears

Strawberry is gone

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

Kristen lays back on the ground staring at the ceiling
watching the candlelight flicker above her All of a sudden
she is sobbing Her hair is covered in thorns and weeds

Kristen wrestles with herself She claws and rips at her
hair trying to remove every piece of the yard from her body
She slams back and forth on the floor as she flips and
twists fighting no one

JAMES (0S)
Kristen

She can hear James’ screams coming from outside She rolls
over pushing her head out the door

JAMES (0S) (cont’d)
Kristen

She searches the backyard for a sign of him but he is nowhere
to be found

JAMES (0S) (contd)
Are you okay

She tries to yell but her voice does not come out Her eyes
show her fear She cannot find his voice

JAMES (0S) (contd)
Tell me where you are

Somewhere around the corner the flag pole rattles as the
cloth twists in the wind

She backpedals forcing the door closed The blood from her
legs stains the wood and the curtains Her head whips around
the room as she tries to see if someone is inside with her

She forces herself to her feet hobbling to the wall of the
dining room until she finds the switch that controls the
overhead light She turns it on

Her hands slam against the table and she pulls herself to the
candles They are almost gone and she blows each one out
She searches the walls where there were once shadows

Satisfied she slides her body off the table and crawls
towards the living room The silver spoon slides onto the
hardwood floor She listens to it rattle and when it stops
she pulls her body forward again

INT HOUSE - NIGHT

Kristen checks the hallway as she makes her way to the back
bedrooms She is shaking uncontrollably as she pauses in
front of every closed door throwing them open and switching
on all the lights

She stands over the old man She has to force herself to
cross him Her foot bumps him and she almost falls trying to
grab a hold of the wall The phone shakes free from the man’s
hand but she does not notice

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

She walks into a side bathroom and with a violent thrust
tears down the shower curtain from it’s rod but there is no
one behind it

INT BEDROOM —- NIGHT

She checks underneath the bed and inside the closet pulling

the string from the hanging bulb and pushing her hands into
the wall of hanging clothes

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Rose petals still rest at the bottom of the tub as she makes
her way into the bathroom Her high heels lie near the
toilet For a few seconds she rests on the bathroom mat

Outside she hears James scream

INT BEDROOM —- NIGHT

Kristen crawls on top of the bed and looks outside the
window but she cannot see James anywhere She now holds a
knife pressing the metal blade pressed against the window
She holds it in such a way as to display it for all those
outside to see

She turns around sitting on the bed The light from the
bathroom casts a soft glow that catches in her eyes as they
lock upon the door and the darkened hall outside it

Her bloody hand squeezes the knife as her knees tap the
bedpost over and over in a nervous twitch In a quiet voice
she sings

KRISTEN
I don’t care if it rains or
freezes

She coughs Her throat is congested making it hard for her
to breathe

All of a sudden the lights shut down inside the entire
house Instantly she is surrounded by darkness She
attempts to jump off the bed but her damaged body cannot
support itself and she falls to the ground

The knife clatters to the floor under the bed

KRISTEN (cont’d)
No no no

She roughly scrapes around underneath the bed for the knife
and finally gives up on the verge of tears She pulls
herself back and drags her body towards the hall

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

She edges along the darkened hallway The only light left in
the house comes from the glowing embers of what remains of
the almost dead fire

KRISTEN
James

Her voice trails off as she reaches the end of the hall

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

The open door leading to the back porch brushes against the
curtains gently in the breeze

The shattered fire alarm lies scattered on the floor inches
in front of Kristen’s face The pieces are brushed to the
side of the room near the wall deliberately smashed

INT ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

She turns and looks down the entry way The strangers have
forced open the front door The piano leans against the wall
and the door hangs open barely left on its hinges

INT DINING ROOM -—- NIGHT

Kristen nears the dining room table when she hears someone’s
footsteps down the entry way behind her A finger drags
along the piano keys many of them now out of tune

INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT

She crawls quickly through the room towards the kitchen She
gets to her feet and then makes her way in frantically

searching for a place to hide

She opens a door and turns to see the Man in the Mask walking
down the back hallway

She pushes her way inside the pantry She yanks the door
closed squeezing herself into the tight space

INT PANTRY - NIGHT

Her hand grips the doorknob as she stands pressed in between
the wooden shelves and the thin door

Wooden blinds cut into the door give her a way to see out
She focuses on the outside door and the dining room table

INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT

The Man in the Mask walks into the kitchen pausing with his
back to Kristen and the pantry On his neck there are
scratches evidence of finger scrapes against his flesh

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

He moves back over to the dining room table where he sits
down in the place James occupied an hour ago He holds the
old man’s hat in his hand

He pulls off his mask and sets it down next to the case for
her ring Sweat drips off his face He is about the same
age as James

He is tired exhausted by the physical exertion of the
night’s events He lights a cigarette from her pack and
leans back in the chair The smoke rises above him in the
moonlight

After a few seconds he slides over the soggy carton of ice
cream from the table and opens the top Cherry flavored
cream drips into his beard as he eats the half melted
dessert

He closes the lid setting the spoon on top of the box and
places it back in the center of the table His eyes continue
to rest on the ice cream as he softly sings

MAN
As long as I got my Plastic
Jesus

He sings to himself the same song Kristen sang minutes ago
He slowly puts the mask back on and then turns on a
flashlight scanning the beam around the room The light
dances over the furniture as he searches

After a couple of quick drags he stubs out his cigarette and
stands up Then he walks out the door

INT PANTRY - NIGHT

The door handle to the pantry twists as Kristen attempts to
open it

She is breathing hard as she builds the courage to open the
door It is an inch from her face and the sound of her
breath against it is almost deafening

She is too frightened to push herself out Her feet press
against an old bag of cat food at the bottom of the pantry

She can hear the click of the door as it crosses the wooden
notch and it begins to open but suddenly stops She pushes
again but the door does not move The sound of her breath
pounds in her ears as Kristen struggles more and more

Then she stops holding her quivering hand in front of her
mouth Her eyes are wide as she stares out the door She
holds her breath but the breathing sound continues

Two plastic eyes appear in the small slits directly in front
of Kristen face Strawberry Shortcake’s plastic mask glares
back at her

STRAWBERRY
I see you

The door slams against Kristen’s head pushing her back into
the cans and paper bags on the shelves behind her Kristen
screams as the door shakes back and forth She kicks at it
crying with pain as she fights the wood in front of her

Then a gunshot fires from outside the house and the door
stops It drifts open and a can of corn rolls out onto the
linoleum floor of the kitchen

Kristen squeezes out onto the kitchen limping Her toes are
bloody from kicking Her ankle is horribly swollen

She pulls open drawers and they fall to the ground spilling
their contents onto the floor She finds a knife a much
smaller one and points it out in front of her

STRAWBERRY (cont’d)
Hello

Kristen screams turning to face Strawberry who stands near
the table She holds the ring case in her hands

STRAWBERRY (cont’d)
Did you say yes

KRISTEN
What do you want

Strawberry is still calm Kristen’s knife does not seem to
frighten her

KRISTEN (contd)
Where’s James

Strawberry shrugs her shoulders Her plastic face smiling at
Kristen’s fear She puts down the case next to the ice
cream

STRAWBERRY
You’re so scared Did you know the
man you killed

KRISTEN
You did that Leave us alone

Strawberry shakes her head “No” very slowly

STRAWBERRY
Youre gonna die

INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT

One of the drawers Kristen had left hanging in its slot
falls loose and clatters to the ground Kristen shields
herself from scattering contents and scoots sideways but she
keeps her knife shakily pointing towards Strawberry

KRISTEN
Why did you come here Why us

STRAWBERRY
Because you were home You
answered the door

Kristen shakes her head back and forth the horrible
realization sinking in

STRAWBERRY (cont’d)
I don’t even know you

She moves towards Kristen but Kristen does not retreat any
further

Outside there is a gunshot Kristen turns towards the
windows The wind chimes blow in the breeze

KRISTEN
He’s going to kill you

Strawberry shakes her head again

STRAWBERRY
What’s your name

KRISTEN
I don’t want to tell you

STRAWBERRY
I heard him say it But I don’t
remember Did you say yes

KRISTEN
He’s going to kill you
STRAWBERRY
No he’s not

For a few moments neither woman speaks nor moves Kristen
sobs to herself then the knife slowly lowers to the ground
beside her

Strawberry continues to inch forward until she is only inches
away Kristen seems oblivious to her Underneath the
plastic mask she can hear the stranger’s breathing growing
faster

In an instant it happens one swipe of the blade and
Strawberry falls back Kristen holds the knife out and it is
covered in blood from the young girl

Strawberry is in pain She holds her forearm but her mask
remains emotionless Kristen watches her waiting for a
reaction

Then she hears the stranger laugh

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

The back door opens through the curtains and James stumbles
inside He is badly beaten his face already swollen around
the eyes and mouth

Kristen yanks herself up but quickly sees that he is not
alone

The Man in the Mask and the Pin Up Girl walk in behind him
The man holds the gun shoving it into James’ back

STRAWBERRY
You were wrong

James locks Kristen’s gaze with half closed eyes His will
to fight has been beaten from him

MAN
Put on a record

Kristen hobbles past them from the dining room into the
hallway then to the back bedrooms

INT BEDROOM —- NIGHT

Kristen slams the door behind her as she falls against side
of the bed in the dark room sobbing The power returns to
the house and the bathroom light turns on Near the bed the
overturned clock radio beeps 12’oclock on the floor

Kristen stands up staring at the closed door From the
living room the sound of the record player starts up the
volume cranked high so that song bleeds into the Kristen’s
ears Her feet crunch the broken glass beneath her but she
seems unfazed

STRAWBERRY (0S)
KristenKristenKristen

Strawberry’s voice floats in from the other side of the door
Her fingers tap the wood methodically

STRAWBERRY (0S) (contd)
He told me You said no

From the living room Kristen can hear the furniture moving a
loud crash broken glass

STRAWBERRY (0S) (contd)
Youre gonna die

Kristen stands shaking and crying and facing the door She
wets herself and it pours down her legs but she does not
care

KRISTEN
Go away

STRAWBERRY (0S)
Kristen

KRISTEN
Leave me alone

Her voice is like a child She is begging pleading

The door opens in front of her but no one is there In the
hallway she can hear James screaming over the record

JAMES (0S)
Kristen

Kristen yells out towards him She forms no words just a
cry but she lets it out at the top of her lungs She is
frozen by his calls

JAMES (0S) (contd)
Kristen

Finally she moves towards the blaring music She whispers
to herself to build up confidence her mouth moving over and
over but it makes no sound Tears stream down her cheeks

KRISTEN
It’s okay it’s okay it’s okay

As she approaches the door frame she stops and looks at the
large mirror hanging on the wall over the dresser The music
continues to pound and James’ screams almost become part of
the melody

Suddenly the screams fall silent

Kristen turns and sprints for the door but the Man in the
Mask is waiting He tosses her like a rag doll against the
wall and she collapses

He grabs her by her hair and pulls her down the hallway past
the old man to the dinning room She does not fight She
has the old man’s blood in her hair

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

The Man in the Mask pauses half way through the room
struggling with her weight and his exhaustion She stares up
at the blank eyes of the mask as he breathes His hands
tighten around the shoulders of her dress and she slides
behind him
94

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

The table has been overturned and James is seated in the
middle of room tied to a chair Beside him is an empty
seat and the man and the Pin Up Girl lift her into it

The music is incredibly loud now making it impossible to
hear anything else

Strawberry ties Kristen’s body to the chair using rusted
baling wire Then she wires her hands together tightly in
front of her while the Man in the Mask whispers in James’
ear

Kristen twists her wrists but finds that only causes the
wire to dig in deeper cutting into her skin

James is crying His pale face contorts with the
understanding of the words coming from the plastic mouth He
whispers back begging and shaking his head

Neither he nor Kristen scream anymore

The Pinup Girl begins opening the curtains around the room
It is almost dawn and the sky behind the barn is beginning to
grow pink

INT DINING ROOM -—- SUNRISE

The strangers take their time turning off every light inside
the house one by one The room is dark at first but over

the next few minutes a warmth begins to grab the walls

The three of them stand in front of James and Kristen
watching them cry

When the record is over the house grows quiet Pin Up goes
to change it and James and Kristen sit in silence

Their knees are almost touching and he slides his leg over
grazing her bruised and bloody skin with his own

He can see her ring and she knows

KRISTEN
I love you

The words come out so soft that only James can hear her

James hums the song they danced to that night His leg
shakes against hers Kristen’s face is too wet from tears to
see she still cries

Strawberry takes off her mask and lays it on the ground near
the table Soon the others follow and for the first time
they are exposed for who they are

The warm light now fills the room as the five of them stare
at each other waiting

MAN
It’s time

Strawberry nods her head in agreement

He pulls out Kristen’s knife and kneels down before James
The Man all of a sudden seems nervous The knife shakes in
one hand while he places the other on his knee for balance

Kristen tries to pull herself free then she rips at the wire
that holds James down

KRISTEN
You can stop Do you hear me It
can stop now

The Man’s eyes shift slightly for a moment staring into
Kristen’s

KRISTEN (cont’d)
I don’t care if it rains or
freezes Long as I have my Plastic
Jesus sitting on the dashboard of
my car

She sings softly to her self and the Man watches her lips say
the words they both remember

James screams over and over as the Man leans in closer He
brings the knife towards James’ body slowly

MAN
Be quiet

His words are not demands He is almost asking her to stop
singing

The blade shakes in his loose grip but then his fingers
tighten around the handle

When the knife pushes in neither James nor the man seem to
know what will happen next James squeals pushing a scream
through his teeth as he grinds his jaw His muscles flex in
pain

Then he is silent and Kristen grows still

The music explodes from the parlor but Pin Up runs and turns
it off

KRISTEN
James Jameslook at me James
look at me

The man stabs him again This time he does it quickly and
James watches the blade go inside him Then he tilts his
head up towards Kristen the veins in his neck about to
burst

KRISTEN (contd)
Look at me Look at my face

The two women stand behind the man Both seem pale and
frightened Pin Up bites her lip nervously but Strawberry
is energized a very faint smile on the edges of her mouth

The Pin Up Girl walks over behind James and strokes his hair

KRISTEN (contd)
Don’t touch him

At first he fights her but then he lets go He is calm
The Pin Up Girl’s hand rests on his neck

Strawberry takes the knife and without taking her eyes off
James’ face drives it into his chest

James coughs his head whipping around He does not fight
anymore He just cries

Strawberry raises her face up to the Pin Up Girl and their
eyes lock for a moment Pin Up slowly moves around in front
of Kristen but Kristen does not seem to notice

Kristen’s eyes fall to the ring case lying on the ground near
the table She does not even react when blade goes in her

KRISTEN (cont’d)
James James James

She repeats his name over and over as the three strangers
begin to cut her

James sits doubled over beside her unable to watch His
breathing becomes more and more clouded as he begins to
choke

KRISTEN (cont’d)
James

FLASHBACK
EXT PARKING LOT —- NIGHT

Kristen leans against the door of the car for support She
holds the ring in front of her Tears form in her eyes

The sound of James’ rental shoes against the gravel seems to
echo throughout the empty cars that surround them

James stares at his hands nervously he has not seen her
face

JAMES
I thought you would like this one
I know how much you liked it when
we saw it At that store you
remember

KRISTEN
I remember

The door to the building bursts open and a GROUP OF WEDDING
GUESTS comes out laughing Kristen and James turn towards
the crowd Everyone has had too much to drink

As Kristen turns around James sees her eyes her face The
hope begins to drain from his expression

KRISTEN (contd)

James I

JAMES
What

KRISTEN
James

JAMES
Oh

A car alarm goes off in the parking lot a few spaces down
The group cannot seem to work their clicker

ONE OF THE GROOMSMEN passes the couple as he makes his way
towards his friends He stops and smiles at both of them
For a second it seems as if he plans to stay

He hands James his glass of wine after he begins to feel the
awkwardness

James does not take his eyes off Kristen as she looks
uncomfortably at the commotion around them

FLASHBACK ENDS

The stabbing stops and they drop the knife on the ground at
Kristens feet Strawberry reaches out and touches her
wounds Kristen twists towards James She tries to touch
him once again

KRISTEN
I need you now James I need
you

James’ gasps for air at the moment of her words For just a
second he is back again from the darkness There is no
sound of the blood that is filling his throat and lungs His
face turns towards her briefly before sinking again to his
chest

JAMES
(Whispering) I know
INT DINING ROOM -—- SUNRISE

The sun peeks over the barn It is hard for James to see
because of the glare from the window

The man picks up his mask and the others’ The women stare
at Kristen’s dress as it turns red in front of them

STRAWBERRY
You are so pretty

INT KITCHEN - SUNRISE

The Pin Up Girl goes into the kitchen behind them and washes
her hands The man follows her and Strawberry goes last
They scrub until the blood is gone They wash their faces
and their arms

Strawberry takes the knife and runs water over the blade
until it is clean again Then she lays it down on the
counter

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

They slowly take off their clothes until they each stand in
their underwear before the couple They put their clothes in
a trash bag that the Pin Up Girl found under the sink

Strawberry hands out clean clothes from a bag she brings from
the door

James and Kristen are still alive

INT DINING ROOM - MORNING

The man walks over with the pile of records holding them out
to the couple

MAN
You can choose

Kristen’s eyes rise from James’ twitching leg After he goes
through a few selections her eyes rest on one of them and
she nods Blood pours from her mouth onto her thigh

Strawberry unties them both precisely so as to keep from
cutting them as the man puts the record on

INT HOUSE - MORNING

The Pin Up Girl helps the man move the piano back into its
original position Then they begin to straighten up the
house They start in the living room working their way into
the entry way

INT DINING ROOM —- MORNING

James collapses onto the ground and Kristen does the same
They seem like dolls Their limbs disjointed like
mannequins Their arms and legs grow limp as the life drains

from their bodies

James is barely breathing under the weight of his body

The three strangers walk out of the house one at a time No
one looks back at James and Kristen and soon the house is
still

Kristen slides her hand across the floor until it rests on
James back Her hand moves up underneath his clothes until
she touches his skin She grabs his gaze as she watches his
eyes begin to falter

James breathes slower and slower until finally he stops

INT HOUSE - MORNING

Kristen stares out along the hardwood floor listening to the
song spinning on the record player She is no longer crying

The music fades and the record player hums waiting for the
next song

Kristen’s eyes glass over For a moment her breathing is
the only sound in the room

The next song begins Her hands slides down next to James’
body one finger still reaching towards him

The wind chimes rattle against each other in the morning
breeze

Then the phone rings

Kristen does not react at first but on the second ring it is
like her eyes come alive again She begins to move towards
the sound

The zipper on the back of her dress scratches the floor as
she begins to push herself along the ground on her back It
is slow at first By the third ring it seems like she has
barely moved at all

Her hands scratch at the floor as she forces her body over
Her arms her entire body are now covered in blood

Kristen struggles into the living room and by the fourth
ring the old man is within her sight The ringing comes
from him Beside her the Smiley face rests having fallen
from the strangers’ bag

She loses her balance and her wrist gives way Her face
slams against the hardwood floor The dull thud of her head
colliding against the wood is sickening but Kristen
continues

She grabs the old man-her hands searching over his bloody
body The damage James has done to him begins to cover her
as Kristen’s hands caress every inch of his body Finally
she hears the ring once again The phone is on the ground
inches away from her face

Her hand reaches out just as the last ring escapes the small

handheld piece of plastic She forces herself on top of the

his remains stretching her body out to grab the phone before
it stops ringing

She slides it to her ear but there is no one there

KRISTEN
Hello Hello

Kristen’s eyes close There is just a dial tone She falls
back to the ground

The Man stands behind her

Kristen begins dialing the phone Her fingers slip across the
small keys First she dials 9 then two 1’s

MAN
How do you know that song

A scream explodes in the hallway as Kristen turns She
forces her body over again this time to face her attacker

Her small hands rises above her head like a shield but the
Man does not seem to notice His young face hovers above
her

The phone lies beside Kristen still silent The send key
untouched The Man finally kneels by her side taking the
mask that rested beside her

MAN (cont’d)
It makes me happy

He turns his back on her and walks towards the door Soon
he is gone Kristen is alone

EXT STREET - DAY

The washed out sky hangs over the open fields in the middle
of nowhere It has rained recently and the ground is wet
around the scattered mail boxes that line the old gravel
road

The street is deserted Empty

DETECTIVE (VO)
Okay Let’s try and do this all at
once(Coughs) Can you hear me
alright I’m just gonna start
Alright

EXT HOUSE - DAY

The large single story house sits a thousand yards from its
closest neighbor There is a long cement driveway that leads
down the side of the property

At the end towards the house sits a once blue four-door
sedan Smoke rises above the charred remains The windows
are smashed out and the tires are slashed Broken pieces of
glass surround the car as it sits flat against its metal
rims

The car is running

Over the blackened hood stands a faded basketball goal A
net hangs on for its life from the rusty orange hoop

The pick up truck idles in the street as the Man looks at the
rear tire The Pin Up Girl sits in the back a cigarette
weighing her hand down over the side

The Man gets back inside the cab and the truck rumbles back
to life and begins the journey down the long road

EXT STREET -—- DAY

Two young boys both in their early teens walk side by side
with their bicycles They wear pressed white shirts and
black slacks

They are Mormons

The taller boy has a backpack slung over one shoulder The

other one holds a pile of pamphlets They both have flat
tops

The boys make their way down the street and they huddle close
together to attempt to shield themselves from the wind
whipping across their skin

The truck pulls to a noisy stop and Strawberry gets out of
the passenger side She is crying a little as she walks
around the back of the truck Her door still hanging open

She approaches the boys she is not much larger than they
are

STRAWBERRY
Can I have one

The smaller boy hands her the yellow piece of paper It
struggles in the wind but Strawberry catches it

BOY
Are you a sinner

STRAWBERRY
Sometimes

She turns back towards the truck and without a look back
climbs inside The truck and the three strangers soon
disappear onto the highway

A few of the pamphlets get away from the small one and he
chases after them but then soon returns empty-handed

They are two houses down from the basketball goal They take
turns walking to each house knocking and ringing the
doorbells When there is no answer they leave the pamphlets
on the mat or in the mailbox and walk back up to the road
again

The boys do not play around with each other as they walk the
road between houses They concentrate on the task at hand
each solemnly staring forward as they pass the overgrown
yards

DETECTIVE (VO)

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Music drifts out to where they stand on the street from
somewhere within the large house

The boy with the backpack waits at the mailbox as the smaller
one walks down the driveway towards the blue Saturn

The smaller boy waves and calls out for his friend to come
closer The music grows louder so as to drown out all other
sound

Eventually the boy with the backpack lays both the bikes
down on the side of the street and walks towards the front
porch cutting across the grass

The smaller boy stands near the car staring at his
reflection in the broken driver’s side window He calls out
to the boy with the backpack again then chases after him up
towards the house

EXT PORCH —- DAY

The boy with the backpack picks up a champagne cork as they
walk along the sidewalk to the porch The smaller boy laughs
nervously as they get closer

The boy with the backpack does not take his eyes off what is
left of the front door

Several pieces of wood lie at their feet as they stand under
the eave of the house The boy with the backpack nudges his
friend towards the door but neither one walks inside

BOY
Hello

Their bikes remain on the street

DETECTIVE (VO)

INT HOUSE - DAY

Dark shadows still surround most of the living room ahead of
them as the boys make their way down the entry way hall The
smashed pieces of a fire alarm lie on the ground

Inaudible beneath the sound of the music the boys call out
as they walk through the darkened room the pamphlets hanging
at the younger boys’ side

names We’re working on it We’1ll
be here all night

INT HOUSE - DAY

The boys walk through the living room as the music grows
louder

No one responds to their calls

INT PARLOR —- DAY

A record spins on an old worn out player The needle is
close to the end as the volume steadily rises

DETECTIVE (VO)
That’s all we got right now Let’s
go Turn this thing off Fuck
This is horrible I think he might
have proposed (Rattling sounds
then a burst of sirens The tape
shuts off)

The record slows and then stops leaving only the sound of
static as the needle rides the edges before stopping

The house is completely quiet
The younger boy sees her first and approaches her body
tentatively His movements show his fear as he kneels before

her and softly his touches her face

He turns to call to his friend and Kristen bolts up her
hands ripping at his shirt

One of the boys screams
