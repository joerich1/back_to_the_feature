1 EXT HIGHWAY -- DAY

GRAHAM DALTON twenty-nine drives his 69 Cutlass
while smoking
a cigarette One could describe his appearance as

punkarty

but neither would do him justice He is a man of
obvious

intelligence and his face is amiable There is only
one key

on his keyring and it is in the ignition

ANN

(voice over)
Garbage I started thinking about
what happens to all the garbage
I mean where do we put all of
it we have to run out of places
to put it eventually dont we
This happened to me before when
that barge with all the garbage
was stranded and nobody would take
it Remember that

2 INT DOCTORS OFFICE -- DAY

ANN BISHOP MILLANEY twenty-six sits opposite her
therapist

She is an extremely attractive woman dressed in a
mature preppy

style There is a wedding ring on her left hand

DOCTOR
Yes I remember What do you do
when these moods overtake you

ANN
Nothing I mean nothing I try
not to do anything that will
produce garbage so obviously were
talking about eating and basic
stuff like that Did you know that
the average person produces three
pounds of garbage a day

DOCTOR
No I didnt

ANN
Dont you think thats a lot of
garbage Id really like to know
where its all going to go

DOCTOR
Do you have any idea what triggered
this concern

ANN
Well this weekend John was taking
out the garbage and he kept
spilling things out of the
container and I started imagining
a container that grew garbage
like it just kept filling up and
overflowing all by itself and
how could you stop that if it
started happening

DOCTOR
Ann do you see a pattern here

ANN
What do you mean

DOCTOR
Well last week we talked about
your obsession with the families
of airline fatalities and now
were talking about your concern
over the garbage problem

ANN
Yeah so

DOCTOR
If you think about it I think
youll see that the object of your
obsession is invariably something
negative that you couldnt possibly
have any control over

ANN
Well do you think many people
run around thinking about how happy
they feel and how great things
are I mean maybe they do but
I doubt those people are in
therapy Besides being happy isnt
all that great My figure is always
at its best when Im depressed

The last time I was really happy

I put on twenty-five pounds I
thought John was going to have

a stroke

JOHN
(voice over)
Its true Im telling you

3 INT LAW OFFICE -- DAY

JOHN MILLANEY twenty-nine sits at his desk talking on
the

telephone He is dressed very well sporting real
suspenders

with his striped pinpoint oxford shirt and cotton suit
He

fingers the wedding ring on his left hand

JOHN
As soon as youve got a ring on
your finger you start getting
serious attention from the opposite
gender Seriously I wish I had
Super Bowl seats for every time
I had some filly just come up
and start talking to me without
the slightest provocation That
never happened before I got
married Shit if Id known that
Id have gone out and bought me
a ring when I was eighteen and
saved myself a lot of time and
money

John looks at his watch

JOHN
Shit I gotta be someplace
(quickly)
Look racquetball Thursday Youre
the coolest

John presses the intercom button while putting on his
jacket

JOHN
Uh Janet re-schedule Kirkland
Tell him to come in Friday at 130
DOCTOR
(voice over to Ann)
Are you still keeping these
thoughts from John

ANN
(voice over)
Yes
4 INT LAW OFFICE BATHROOM -- DAY

John brushes his teeth and combs his hair very
carefully

DOCTOR
(voice over to Ann)
Are you afraid of his reaction
Of his finding you silly for
thinking of such things

ANN

(voice over)
No I dont know I havent told
him about the garbage thing because
Im pissed off at him right now
Hes letting some old college buddy
stay at our house for a couple
of days and he didnt even ask
me about it I mean I wouldve
said yes I just wish he wouldve
asked

5 INT DOCTORS OFFICE-DAY

DOCTOR
What upsets you about that

ANN
I guess Im upset because I cant
really justify being upset I mean
its his house really he pays
the mortgage

DOCTOR
But he asked you to quit your job
and you do have housework

ANN
Yeah I know

DOCTOR
This unexpected visit
the
and begin
but

definite

notwithstanding how are things
with John

ANN
(shrugs)
Fine I guess Except right now
I m going through this where I
dont want him to touch me

INT CYNTHIA BISHOPS APARTMENT -- DAY

CYNTHIA BISHOP Anns SISTER opens her door to reveal
freshly coifed John Millaney They kiss passionately

to disrobe Cynthia bears a slight resemblance to Ann
is not as overtly attractive She does however have a
carnal appeal and air of confidence that Ann lacks

DOCTOR
(voice over)
When did you begin having this feeling

ANN
(voice over)
About a week ago I dont know
what brought it on I just started
feeling like I didnt want him
to touch me

DOCTOR
(voice over to Ann)
Prior to this feeling were you
comfortable having physical contact
with him

ANN

(voice over)
Oh yeah

(pause)
But see Ive never really been
into sex that much I mean I like
it and everything it just doest
freak me out I wouldnt miss it
you know But anyway lately we
havent been doing anything at
all Like I said its not that
I miss it but I m curious the
way things kind of slacked off
all of a sudden
John and Cynthia are now having sex

DOCTOR

(voice over)
Perhaps he senses your hesitance

at being touched

ANN
(voice over)
But see he stopped before I got
that feeling thats why it seems
weird to me I mean Im sure he
wishes I would initiate things
once in awhile and I would
except it never occurs to me Im
always thinking about something
else and then the few times that I
have felt like starting something
I was by myself

DOCTOR
(voice over)
Did you do anything

A pause

ANN
(voice over)
What do you mean

DOCTOR
(voice over)
Did you masturbate

7 INT DOCTORS OFFICE -- DAY

ANN
(taken aback)
God no

DOCTOR
I take it youve never masturbated

ANN
(slightly uncomfortable)

Well I kind of tried once It
just seemed stupid I kept seeing
myself lying there and it seemed
stupid and kind of uh I dont
know and then I was wondering

if my dead grandfather could see
me doing this and it just seemed

like a dumb thing to be doing when
we dont know what to do with all

that garbage you know

DOCTOR
So it was recently that you tried
this

ANN

(exhales head down)
Well kind of recently I guess
But not too recently

There is a pause

ANN
Im really not up to having a guest
in the house

INT CYNTHIA BISHOPS APARTMENT -- DAY
John and Cynthia are lying in bed bathed in sweat

JOHN
Ive got to get back to the office

CYNTHIA
I only get one today Gee how
exciting

John rolls over and begins to put his clothes on

JOHN
I cant let my lunch hour go on
too long Ive already skipped
one meeting

CYNTHIA
Dont give me this
passiveaggressive bullshit If
you want to leave leave My life
doesnt stop when you walk out the
door you know what Im saying

John shakes his head
JOHN
Why dont you just tell me how
you really feel

John stands and begins putting on his clothes
JOHN
I have a friend coming in from
out of town Ill probably be
spending some time with him the
next couple of days

CYNTHIA
Meaning well have to cool it for
awhile right

JOHN
Right

A silent shrug from Cynthia John is almost completely

dressed
JOHN
I wish youd quit that bartending
job
CYNTHIA
Why
JOHN

I hate the thought of guys hitting
on you all the time

CYNTHIA
I can handle it Besides the money
is good and some of the guys are
cute And you are in no position
to be jealous

JOHN
Who said I was jealous

CYNTHIA
I did

John says nothing

CYNTHIA
You know Id like to try your
house sometime The idea of doing
it in my sisters bed gives me
a perverse thrill

John thinks about that

CYNTHIA
I wish I could tell everybody that
Anns a lousy lay Beautiful
popular Ann Bishop Millaney

JOHN
Could be risky

CYNTHIA
Well maybe I could just start
a rumor then

JOHN
No I mean doing it at my house

CYNTHIA
Afraid of getting caught

JOHN
Maybe

CYNTHIA
You should be Can I meet this
friend of yours

JOHN
Cynthia I dont think you want
to I mean you should see the
way he dresses I really think
hes in a bad way

CYNTHIA
Im intrigued

JOHN
Youre intrigued

CYNTHIA
Sure Maybe hes the man Im
looking for Then I wont have
to fuck worried husbands all the
time

John looks at her for a moment before heading for the
door

JOHN
Bye

trunk revealing a Sony 8mm Video rig and a single
bag He grabs the duffle bag and shuts the trunk
Graham knocks at the door He is stubbing out a

his beaten tennis shoe when Ann answers the door She

to hide her suprise at his appearance

GRAHAM
Ann

ANN
Yes

GRAHAM

(extends his hand)
Graham Dalton

Ann shakes his hand

GRAHAM
Can I use your bathroom

Ann withdraws her hand

ANN
Yes Yes come in please

Graham moves inside

INT JOHN AND ANN MILLANEYS HOUSE -- DAY

Ann closes the door and motions Graham to the rear of
ANN

Straight back first door on the
left

Graham heads for the bathroom Ann heads for the phone
dials Johns office

VOICE ON PHONE
Forman Brent and Millaney

ANN
John Millaney please This is
his wife
Graham exits the bathroom Ann quickly hangs up the
phone

ANN
That was quick

GRAHAM
False alarm

ANN
Oh Well please sit down

Graham sits his manner pleasantly animated He gets
his Gitanes
from inside his scuffed black leather jacket and looks

around
for an ashtray Ann swallows uncomfortably
ANN
Wedont usually let people smoke
in the house We have a patio if you --
GRAHAM
Oh no problem It can wait
A moment of silence Graham looks at Ann directly It
is not
a challenging stare hes just trying to ascertain what
kind
of person she is Ann to her credit somehow meets his
gaze
Something subtle passes between them
ANN
(looks at duffle bag)
Do you have other things
GRAHAM
Yes
(pause)
Oh you mean to bring in No Yes
I have some other things no I
dont need to bring them in This
is all I need to stay here
ANN
Oh
Graham smiles He has an unusual face a face that
fluctuates

between remarkably handsome and just plain strange
GRAHAM
Have you ever been on television

ANN
Televison

GRAHAM
Yes

No Why

GRAHAM
(shrugs)
Curious

The central air-conditioning switches on Ann smiles

ANN
Graham is an unusual name

GRAHAM
Yeah I guess it is My mother
is a complete Anglophile anything
British makes her drool like a
baby She probably heard the name
in some movie Shes a prisoner
of public television now

ANN
Oh uh-huh

GRAHAM
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance

ANN
(downplaying)
No I think you lookfine

GRAHAM
(smiles)
Oh Well maybe Im uncomfortable
with my appearance I feel a little
out of place in these surroundings

ANN
Well

GRAHAM
I used to take great pleasure in
that being purposefully different
rubbing peoples noses in it
Didnt you do that when you were
younger

ANN
(thinks)
No not really

GRAHAM
Oh Well I did I was in a band
once and the music was always
secondary to just flat out
offending as many people as
possible

ANN
You play an instrument

GRAHAM
No I was in charge of kind of
standing at the microphone and
reciting these really depressing
lyrics in a monotone The whole
thing was really irrelevant
How do you like being married

ANN
(caught slightly off
guard)
Oh I like it I like it very much

GRAHAM
What about it do you like Im
not being critical Id really
like to know

ANN

Well well the cliché about
the security of it thats really
true We own a house and I really
like that you know And I like
that John was just made junior
partner so he has a steady job
and hes not some

Ann looks at Graham and stops He smiles again

ANN
free-lance You know

GRAHAM
Yes So you feel security
stability Like things are going
to last awhile

ANN
Oh definitely I mean just this
past year has gone by like phew
I hardly even knew it passed

GRAHAM
Did you know that if you shut
someone up in a room and the only
clock he has reference to runs
two hours slow for every
twenty-four that his body will
eventually adjust to that schedule
Simply because the mind honestly
perceives that twenty-six hours
are twenty-four the body follows
And then there are sections of time
Your life can be broken down into
the sections of time that formed
your personality (if you have one)
For instance when I was twelve
I had an eleven minute conversation
with my father that to this day
defines our relationship Now
Im not saying that everything
happened in that specific section
of time but the events of my
childhood involving my father led
up to and then were crystallized
in that eleven minutes

Ann is fascinated if a bit overwhelmed

ANN
Oh uh-huh

GRAHAM
(smiles)
Anyway I think the mind is very
flexible as far as time is
concerned

ANN
You mean like time flies

GRAHAM
Exactly I would say the fact that
you feel the first year of your
marriage has gone by quickly means
lots of things Or could mean lots
of things
ANN
How long has it been since youve
seen John

GRAHAM
Nine years

ANN
Nine years

GRAHAM
Yes I was surprised that he
accepted when I asked if I could
stay here until I found a place

ANN
Why Didnt you know him well

GRAHAM
I knew him very well We were
extremely close until I dropped
out

A pause

ANN
Whyd you drop out

GRAHAM
Oh lots of reasons most of them
boring But up until I dropped
out John and I werevery much
alike

ANN
Thats hard to believe The two
of you seem so different

GRAHAM
I would imagine that we are now
I think Im ready to use the
bathroom finally

Graham gets up and heads for the toilet Ann watches

him go

a bemused smile on her face After she hears the door
close

she cant resist the impulse to take a closer look at
Grahams

bag
IN THE BATHROOM Graham pokes around looking through
the
medicine cabinet and sniffing towels

JOHN
(voice over)
Call the cops

11 INT JOHN AND ANN MILLANEYS HOUSE -- NIGHT
John Ann and Graham are eating dinner

JOHN
(to Graham)
Thats the first thing that ran
through my mind when I saw you
I thought this is not the same
man that rode the unicycle naked
through the homecoming parade

ANN
(to Graham)
You did that

GRAHAM
Everybody has a past

JOHN
(smiles at Graham)
What do you think the Greeks would
make of that outfit youre wearing

GRAHAM
A bonfire probably

John takes a sip of Chivas

GRAHAM
(to Ann)
This food is excellent

ANN

add more if you want but you cant
take it out

GRAHAM
(to Ann)
You have family here also

ANN

GRAHAM

ANN
(interested)
Whos Elizabeth

JOHN
Girl Graham dated Still lives

Graham eats in silence

ANN
Graham and I were talking about
apartments and I told him to check
the Garden District there are
some nice little places there
garage apartments and stuff

JOHN
(to Graham)
Stay away from the Garden District
Serious crime I dont know what
kind of place youre looking for
but there are a lot of studio-type
apartments available elsewhere

GRAHAM
I wish I didnt have to live
someplace

JOHN
(laughs)
What do you mean

Graham thinks a moment then puts his keyring with its
single
key onto the table

GRAHAM
Well see right now I have this
one key and I really like that
Everything I own is in my car
If I get an apartment thats two
eys If I get a job maybe I

have to open and close once in
awhile thats more keys Or I

buy some stuff and I m worried
about getting ripped off so I

get some locks and thats more
eys I just really like having
the one key Its clean you know

Graham looks at the keyring before returning it to his
pocket

JOHN
Get rid of the car when you get
your apartment then youll still
have one key

GRAHAM
I like having the car the car
is important

JOHN
Especially if you want to leave
someplace in a hurry

GRAHAM
Or go someplace in a hurry

Ann takes her plate into the kitchen

JOHN
(smiles at Graham)
Do you pay taxes

Graham also stands empty plate in hand

GRAHAM
Do I pay taxes Of course I pay
taxes only a liar doesnt pay
taxes Im not a liar A liar is
the second lowest form of human
being

ANN
(from the kitchen)
Whats the first

GRAHAM
Lawyers

John smiles thinking Graham follows Ann into the
kitchen
John shouts after them

JOHN
Hey Ann why dont you go with
Graham to hunt for apartments
Show him how the city has changed

Ann looks at Graham

ANN
Would you mind

GRAHAM
No

ANN
(shouts back to John)
Okay I will

John sitting at the table and now toying with his
keyring
nods

12 INT JOHN AND ANN MILLANEYS HOUSE -- NIGHT
Everyone but Ann is asleep She gets up from her bed

and sneaks
quietly into the guest bedroom where Graham is staying

She

walks cautiously up to his bed to watch him as he
sleeps

Moonlight caresses his face as he breathes peacefully
Exhaling

he turns over slowly his back to Ann

She picks up his jacket from beside the bed and feels
the

surface She brings the jacket to her nose inhaling
his

presence She then sets the jacket down

She smiles kicking off her shoes

CYNTHIA

Cynthia begins taking her clothes off She places her
diamond

stud earring in her jacket pocket and then drops the
jacket

on the floor She moves onto the bed with John

ANN
(voice over)
Maybe youll understand this
because you know John but he
confuses me sometimes

GRAHAM
(voice over)
How do you mean

16 INT CAFE - DAY

Graham and Ann are having lunch Ann looks to have had
a lot
of wine Graham drinks club soda with a twist

ANN
Its hard to explain Its like
John treats everybody the same
you know I mean he acts just
as excited about seeing somebody
he hardly knows as he does when
he sees me And so I feel like
whats different about me if Im
treated exactly the same as some
acquaintance If I dont like
somebody I dont act like I do
I guess thats why a lot of people
think Im a bitch

She takes a sip of wine

GRAHAM
Yeah I know I mean Im not
saying I know people think youre
a bitch Im saying I know what
you mean And I dont even know
that people think youre a bitch
Do they

ANN
I feel like they do

GRAHAM
Hmm Well maybe you are Really
I wouldnt pay much attention

Ann smiles

GRAHAM
I know that I just dont feel a
connection with very many people
so I dont waste time with people
I dont feel one with

ANN
Right right I dont feel
connected to many people either
Other than John

Graham nods

ANN
Can I tell you something personal
I feel like I can Its something
I couldnt tell John Or wouldnt
anyway

GRAHAM
Its up to you But I warn you
if you tell me something personal
I might do the same

ANN

Okay I thinkI think sex is
overrated I think people place
way too much importance on it
And I think that stuff about women
wanting it just as bad is crap
I m not saying women dont want
it I just dont think they want
it for the reason men think they
do

(smiles)
Im getting confused

Graham smiles

ANN
Do you understand what Im trying
to say

GRAHAM
I think so I remember reading
somewhere that men learn to love
what theyre attracted to whereas
women become more and more
attracted to the person they love

ANN
Yes Yes I think thats very true
Very

Graham watches Ann take a sip of wine

GRAHAM
So what about kids

ANN
Kids What about them

GRAHAM
Do you want them

ANN
Yeah actually I do But John
doesnt At least not right now

GRAHAM
Why is that

ANN
I dont know he just said he wants
to wait I quit asking

Graham nods

ANN
So whats your personal thing
Are you really going to tell me
something personal

GRAHAM
Do you want me to

ANN
As long as its notgross you
know Like some scar or something
It has to be like mine like
something about you

GRAHAM
Agreed
Graham takes a sip of club soda

GRAHAM
Im impotent

Ann looks at him closely

ANN
Youre what

GRAHAM
Impotent

ANN
You are

GRAHAM

Well let me put it this way I
cannot achieve an erection while
in the presence of another person
So for all practical purposes

I am impotent

Ann takes a large sip of wine Graham lights a cigarette

ANN
Does it bother you

GRAHAM

(exhales)
Not usually I mean honestly
I havent known many guys that
could think straight with an
erection so I feel Im way ahead
of the game as far as being
clear-headed goes

ANN
Wellare you self-conscious about
it

GRAHAM

I am self-conscious but not in
the same way that you are You
have got to be the most attractive
self-conscious person Ive ever
seen

ANN
Why do you say Im self-conscious
GRAHAM
Well Ive been watching you Ive
watched you eat Ive watched you
speak Ive watched the way you
move and I see somebody who is
extremely conscious of being looked
at I think you really believe
that people are looking at you
all the time And you know what

ANN
What

GRAHAM

hey are looking at you Ann you
re truly breathtaking I dont
now if you understand how your
ppearance can affect people Men
ant to possess you women wish
hey looked like you And those
hat dont or cant resent you
And the fact that youre a nice
person just makes it worse

ade eo woe

ANN
(thinks)
My therapist said that--

GRAHAM
Youre in therapy

ANN
Arent you

GRAHAM
Hah No Im not Actually I used
to be but the therapist I had
was really ineffectual in helping
me deal with my problems Of
course I lied to him constantly
so I guess I cant hold him totally
responsible

ANN
So you dont believe in therapy

GRAHAM
I believe in it for some people
I mean for me it was silly I
was confused going in So I just
formed my own personal theory that
you should never take advice from
someone of the opposite sex that
doesnt know you intimately

ANN
Well my therapist knows me
intimately
GRAHAM
(surprised)

You had sex with you therapist

ANN
Of course not

GRAHAM
Oh see I meant someone youve
had sex with Thats part of the
theory

ANN
Excuse me for asking but how would
you know
GRAHAM
(smiles)
Well I wasnt always impotent

Ann takes another sip of wine and thinks for a moment

ANN
Now you said never take advice
from someone that you dont know
intimately right

GRAHAM
Basically yes

17 INT JOHN AND ANN MILLANEYS HOUSE -- DAY

Cynthia is leaving the house She gives John a big
kiss

ANN
(voice over)
So since Ive never had sex with
you by your own advice I shouldnt
accept your advice

GRAHAM
(voice over)
Thats correct
(pause)
Bit of a dilemma isnt it
Cynthia is not wearing her diamond stud earring
18 INT DOCTORS OFFICE -- DAY

ANN
Well I dont know The week
started off okay but then I was
outside watering the plants and
I started feeling dizzy from the
heat and that got me thinking about
the Greenhouse Effect so I went
inside and turned on the
air-conditioner full blast and
that made me feel a little better
until I started thinking about
radon leakage coming up through
the floor and--

DOCTOR
Radon leakage

ANN
Yes its this radioactive gas
in the ground and houses kind
of act like magnets to pull it
up and--youve never heard of
this

DOCTOR
No I havent

ANN
Well the cumulative effect is
not good let me tell you
(pause)
I knew I shouldnt have watered
those plants

DOCTOR
Did you confront John about the
visitor

ANN

What visitor

DOCTOR
The friend of Johns that was
staying at your house

ANN
Oh Graham No I didnt talk to
him about that Actually that
turned out to be pretty
interesting I expected Graham

to be thiswell like John you
know I mean he said they had
gone to school together so I was
expecting lots of stories about
getting drunk and secret handshakes
and stuff But he turned out to

be thisthis kind of character

I mean hes kind of arty but okay
you know

DOCTOR
Is he still at your house

ANN
No he left last week

DOCTOR
Did you find him attractive

ANN
What do you mean like physically

DOCTOR
Let me rephrase Were you attracted
to him

ANN
(thinks)
guess but not because of the
way he looked or anything Hes
just so different somebody new
to have a conversation with Im
just tired of talking to other
couples about whether or not
theyre going to buy the station
wagon you know Its just boring
dont know he was just
different And hes really on about
truth a lot being honest and
like that I felt comfortable
around him
(pause)
After he left I had a dream that
he signed a lease to rent our guest
room

CYNTHIA
(voice over)
So wheres he from
19 INT CYNTHIA BISHOPS APARTMENT -- DAY

around

CYNTHIA

ANN
No not at all Actually I dont
think John likes him much anymore
He said he thought Graham had
gotten strange

A pause

CYNTHIA

his brains out what business is
that of yours

ANN
Do you have to say that

CYNTHIA
What

ANN
You know what You say it just
to irritate me

CYNTHIA
I say it because its descriptive

ANN
Well he doesnt strike me as the
kind of person that would go in
for that sort of thing anyway

CYNTHIA
Ann you always underestimate me

ANN
Well I wonder why

CYNTHIA
I think youre afraid to put the
two of us in the same room
together I think youre afraid
hell be undeniably drawn to me

ANN
Oh for Gods sake Really
Cynthia really I dont think
hes your type

CYNTHIA
My type What is this bullshit

is

ANN
I have a pretty good idea

20 INT DOCTORS OFFICE -- DAY

ANN
I was thinking maybe I shouldnt
be in therapy anymore

DOCTOR
What brought this on

ANN
Ive been thinking about it for
awhile and then I was talking
to somebody who kind of put things
in perspective for me

DOCTOR
(smiles)
I thought thats what I did Who
was it that you talked to

ANN
That guy Graham I told you about
He said taking advice from someone
you dont know intimately
waswell he said a lot of stuff

The Doctor exhales thinking for a moment

DOCTOR
Ann in life one has to be aware
of hidden agendas
(pause)
Did it occur to you that Graham
may have his own reasons for not
wanting you to be in therapy

ANN
What do you mean I dont
understand

DOCTOR
Its possible that Graham has
hidden motives for disliking
therapy andor therapists Perhaps
he has problems of his own that
he is unwilling to deal with and
he would like to see other people
you for instance wallow in their
situation just as he does Do you
think thats possible

ANN
I guess

DOCTOR
You understand that you are free
to leave therapy at any time

ANN
Yes

DOCTOR
That you are under no obligation
to me
an 8mm

himself

DOCTOR
Do you want to leave therapy

ANN
Not really

DOCTOR
Do you feel there is more progress

to be made

ANN
Yes

DOCTOR
Im glad you feel that way because
I feel that way too
ANN
But you dont have hidden motives
for feeling that way right
The Doctor laughs Ann does not laugh with him
INT GRAHAMS APARTMENT -- DAY
On a television monitor we see images originating from
Video deck Graham sits naked in a sheet-covered chair
the screen He watches the tape which is footage of
interviewing a girl about her sexual preferences The
photography on the tape is handheld relentless As the
questions get more detailed Graham becomes more
There is a knock on Grahams door He calmly shuts off
videotape player and stands wrapping the sheet around
GRAHAM
Its open

Graham walks into the bedroom to put on some clothes

the door and walks into the apartment
Hi

GRAHAM

GRAHAM
(off)

Graham picks up an Anais Nin diary and opens it to show

Ann
the library sleeve inside

Describe for me your first sexual

CYNTHIA
My first sexual experience or the

GRAHAM
Your first sexual experience

CYNTHIA
(thinks)
I waseight years old Michael
Green who was also eight asked
if he could watch me take a pee
I said he could if I could watch
him take one too He said okay
and then we went into the woods
behind our house I got this
feeling he was chickening out
because he kept saying Ladies
first So I pulled down my
underpants and urinated and he
ran away before I even finished

GRAHAM
Was it ever a topic of conversation
between the two of you afterward

CYNTHIA
No He kind of avoided me for the
rest of the summer and then his
family moved away To Cleveland
actually

GRAHAM
How unfortunate So when did you
finally get to see a penis

CYNTHIA
When I was fourteen

GRAHAM
Live or in a photograph or film
of some sort

CYNTHIA
Very much live

GRAHAM
What did you think Did it look
like you expected

CYNTHIA
Not really I didnt picture it
with veins or ridges or anything
I thought it would be smooth like
a test tube

GRAHAM
Were you disappointed

CYNTHIA
No If anything after I looked
at it awhile it got more
interesting It had character
you know

GRAHAM
What about when you touched it
What did you expect it to feel
like and then what did it really
feel like

CYNTHIA
t was warmer than I thought it
would be and the skin was softer
than it looked Its weird
Thinking about it now the organ
itself seemed like a separate
thing a separate entity to me
mean after he pulled it out
and I could look at it and touch
it I completely forgot that there
was a guy attached to it I
remember literally being startled
when the guy spoke to me

GRAHAM
What did he say

CYNTHIA
He said that my hand felt good

GRAHAM
Then what happened

CYNTHIA
Then I started moving my hand
and then he stopped talking

INT JOHN AND ANN MILLANEYS HOUSE -- DAY
Ann dressed in some of Johns work clothes (old cotton
shirt

khaki pants) is cleaning the house Not cleaning like a
normal

person but like an obsessivecompulsive person
Scrubbing spots

that are already clean vacuuming the same area of rug
over

and over etc Suddenly an object lodges itself in the
snout

of the vacuum cleaner making a loud noise Shutting
the machine

off Ann turns it over and sees that Cynthias diamond

stud

earring has gotten hooked in the take-up roller

Ann stares at Cynthias earring for a long moment

CUT TO

Cynthia picking up her jacket from beside the bed after
having

sex with John The earring slips out of the pocket and
bounces

under the edge of the bed

CUT BACK TO

Ann as she sets the earring onto the floor and begins
to pound

it with the bottom of a water glass trying to smash it
to

pieces She soon realizes the futility of trying to
break a

diamond

Ann looks down at herself Suddenly realizing that she
is

dressed in Johns clothing she frantically rips the
shirt and

pants from her body as though the material were burning
her

skin Popped buttons skid across the floor

Clothed only in her bra and underwear Ann sits in the
middle
of the bedroom floor arms around herself

43 EXT JOHN AND ANN MILLANEYS HOUSE -- DAY

Ann now in jeans and t-shirt stumbles to her car
Once inside
she jams the key into the ignition and rests her head

against
the steering wheel
44 EXT GRAHAMS APARTMENT -- DAY
Ann lifts her head from the steering wheel and looks
up She
looks almost surprised to find that she has driven to
Grahams
Slowly she gets out of the car
45 INT GRAHAMS APARTMENT -- DAY
Graham sits reading
There is a weak knock at the door Graham listens not
sure he
heard anything There is a second weak knock
GRAHAM
Its open
Nothing happens Graham gets up and opens the door
himself

Ann stands against the wall of the hallway her head
down her
breathing deliberate Concerned Graham slowly begins

to lead

her inside Impulsively she hugs him tightly

Unaccustomed to physical contact Grahams hands hang
awkwardly

at his side Ann slowly pulls back from the embrace and
sits

down Graham goes to the kitchen area and gets her a
glass of

water He gives it to her and sits in the chair
opposite Ann
holds the glass in her hand staring at it

GRAHAM
Its bottled not tap

A weak smile from Ann She drinks swallowing with
difficulty

ANN
Im not sure why I came here I
had kind of decided not to talk
to you afteryou know
GRAHAM
I know

A pause

ANN
That son of a bitch

Ann looks at Graham

ANN
(sarcastic)
John and Cynthia have been
fucking
GRAHAM
I know
ANN
(stunned)
You know
GRAHAM
Yes
ANN

How did you know

GRAHAM
She said it on her tape

ANN
(angry)
Why didnt you tell me

GRAHAM
Ann when would I have told you
We were not speaking if you
recall

Ann says nothing

GRAHAM
But even if we had been speaking
I wouldnt have told you

ANN
Why not

GRAHAM
Its not my place to tell you these
things Ann You have to find out
by yourself or from John directly
You have to trust me on this

Ann shakes her head

ANN
My life isshit Its all shit
Its like somebody saying Okay
chairs are not chairs theyre
actually swimming pools I mean
nothing is what I thought it was
What happened to me Have I been
asleep I vaguely remember the
wedding but a lot of it is just
a blurlike I was watching
from a distance I cant believe
him Why didnt I trust my
intuition

Graham says nothing

Ann looks

A pause

ANN
And Im vacuuming his goddam rug
His rug that he paid to have put
in his house Nothing in that place
belongs to me I wanted to put
some of my grandmothers furniture
in it but he wouldnt let me
So I m vacuuming his rug That
bastard

at Graham

ANN
I want to make a tape

GRAHAM
Do you think thats such a good
idea

ANN
Dont you want to make one

GRAHAM
Yes But I sense the element of
revenge here

ANN
What difference does it make why
I do it
GRAHAM
I want you to be aware of what
youre doing and why because I
know that this is not the sort
of thing you would do in a normal
frame of mind

ANN
What would you know about a normal
frame of mind

GRAHAM
(impressed)
Thats a good question

ANN
What do you have to do to get
ready

GRAHAM
Load a new tape turn the camera
on

ANN
Then do it

Graham opens a new box of videotapes

ANN
How do you pay for all this I
mean rent and tapes and this
equipment

GRAHAM

John is talking on the phone as Ann walks through the

Jesus

JOHN

John moves to sit beside her on the couch Ann does not
look
at him

JOHN
(conciliatory)
Ann honey please tell me whats

cant just go without telling me
why

Ann turns to look at him for a moment then turns away

ANN
Fuck you I can do what I want

Johns mouth literally hangs open in shock He is
dumbstruck

ANN
Ill stay at my mothers

John gets up from the couch and begins pacing

JOHN
Where did you go when you left
here

ANN

I drove around Then I went to
talk with Graham

John smacks his hand on his leg

JOHN
Goddammit goddammit That son
of a bitch
(thinking)
Well at least I know you didnt

No but I wanted to I really
wanted to partially just to piss
you off

John is seething

JOHN

of sense He cant and you wont

sense

John walks over to Ann

JOHN
Did you make one of those goddam

JOHN

John explodes hitting the wall all around Ann She
cowers
beneath the storm

John bolts from the house

ANN
DONT YOU TOUCH HIM

Graham stands in the middle of the room with a
cigarette in
his mouth trying to teach himself to moonwalk

50 EXT GRAHAMS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

John screeches to a halt parking haphazardly He gets
out of
the car and runs to Grahams apartment
51 INT GRAHAMS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

John bursts through the door without bothering to
knock Graham

looks up startled Before he can even react John has
him by

the lapels

GRAHAM
Hi John

JOHN

GRAHAM

GRAHAM

John as a lawyer you should know
that those tapes are private

JOHN
What the hell do you think I

John punches Graham in the jaw knocking him to the

floor
Graham feels his mouth for blood as John picks him up
by the
shirt
JOHN
Graham I swear to Christ Ill

me those tapes
GRAHAM
No
John roughly pushes Graham into one of the directors
chairs
which topples over and throws Graham to the floor once
again

John looks around He sees the boxes of tapes and
begins to

go through the contents Graham gets up and runs over
to stop

him

GRAHAM
Get away from those They belong
to me

Graham and John struggle John hits Graham in the
stomach and
pushes him to the floor

JOHN
Give me your keys

John bends over and starts going through Grahams
pockets
He then

to search

Anns tapes

He turns

to the

hear

JOHN
Your keys asshole Your two
fucking keys Give them to me

GRAHAM
Im not going to give you my keys

John beats Graham until Graham can offer no resistance
drags Graham into the hallway and leaves him there
John then locks himself inside Grahams apartment

John walks over to the boxes of videotapes and begins
through them spastically He finds both Cynthia and
After a brief deliberation he decides to watch Anns
on the player and the monitor After pulling a chair up
screen John presses the button marked play

In the hallway Graham drags himself to the door of his
apartment Putting his ear to the inlet he strains to

what is going on inside
John watches the monitor come to life
The image is Ann sitting in a chair

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Tell me your name

ANN
(on tape)
Ann Bishop Millaney

GRAHAM
(on tape)
You are married correct

JOHN
Goddam right

ANN
(on tape)

GRAHAM
(on tape)

Johns jaw tightens

JOHN

JOHN
(shouting at Graham)
You son of a bitch

ANN
(on tape)
Not very often

GRAHAM
(on tape)

John is literally so mad he cant speak He watches the
screen

in mute anger his hands wrapped tightly around the
arms of

the chair Graham still listens from the hallway

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Have you ever wanted to make love
to someone other than your husband

JOHN
Goddamit

Ann hesitates

JOHN
(to Anns image)
Answer him goddammit

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Youre hesitating I think that
means you have

JOHN
(to Graham on tape)
Shut up

ANN
(on tape)
You dont know what Im thinking

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Its a simple question Have you
ever thought of having--making
love with someone other than your
husband

John leans forward

ANN
(on tape)
Is he going to see this

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Absolutely not

A sarcastic chuckle from John In the hallway Graham
furrows

his brow

ANN
(on tape)
I have thought about it yes

JOHN
(to Anns image)
You bitch I knew it

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Did you have sex before you were
married

ANN
(on tape)
Yes

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Did the person you made love with
satisfy you more than your husband

JOHN
(to Graham)
God damn you

ANN
(on tape)
Yes

John stands and throws his chair against the door
Graham still
listening at the door is startled

GRAHAM
(on tape)
And you have thought aboutmaking
love to that person again since
you ve been married

John watches the monitor his eyes beginning to water

ANN

(on tape)
I dont see what difference it
makes I mean I can think what
I want

(pause)
I dont know if I want to do this
anymore Im afraidI dont mind
answering the questions so much
but if somebody were to see this

GRAHAM
(on tape)
At some level I dont understand
your nervousness Have you decided
to leave John
Ann thinks John watches

ANN
(on tape)
Yes I have I will

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Then as far as this taping goes
you have nothing to worry about

ANN
(on tape)
I guess not

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Do you want me to stop

John absorbed in the image absently shakes his head

ANN
(on tape)
No

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Are there people other than your
previous lover that you have
fantasized about

A pause

ANN

(on tape)
Yes Wheneverall right look
Whenever I see a man that I think
is attractive I wonder what it
would be like with him I mean
Im just curious I dont act on
it but I hate that I think that
I wish I could just forget about

that stuff
GRAHAM
(on tape)
Why
ANN
(on tape)

Because thats how Cynthia thinks
All she does is think about that
stuff and I hate that I dont
want to be like her I dont want
to be like her

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Youre not like your sister You
couldnt be like her if you wanted
to

ANN
(on tape)
I know Deep down I know that
It just bothers me when I have
feelings or impulses that she has

John picks up the chair he threw and sets it upright
He sits

down and watches the screen impassively Graham still
listens

from outside

GRAHAM
(on tape)
So you do fantasize

ANN
(on tape)
Yes

GRAHAM
(on tape)
About who

ANN
(on tape)
I fantasized about you

GRAHAM
(on tape)
About me

ANN
(on tape)

Yes
A pause
ANN

(on tape)
Have you fantasized about me
GRAHAM
(on tape)
I thought I made that clear before
when I said I would go down on
you

ANN
(on tape)
I remember You could do that
couldnt you Go down on me

GRAHAM
(on tape)
Yes

ANN
(on tape)
If I asked you to would you Not
on tape I mean

GRAHAM
(on tape)
No

(on tape)
On tape

(on tape)
No

ANN
(on tape)
Why not

GRAHAM
(on tape)
If I cant do it all I dont want
to do anything And I cant do
it all

ANN
(on tape)
Cant or wont

A pause John is still watching the tape his face
betraying

no emotion Graham still listens from outside

CUT TO
The previous afternoon We are no longer looking at Ann
on the

monitor but watching her and Graham AS THEY MADE THE
TAPE For

instance we can now see Graham from Anns point of
view or the

two of them at the same time etc

GRAHAM
Cant

ANN
You said you werent always
impotent

GRAHAM

Thats correct

ANN
So you have had sex

GRAHAM
Yes

ANN
Who was the last person you had
sex with

GRAHAM
Her name was Elizabeth

ANN
So what happened Was it so bad
that it turned you off

GRAHAM
No it was wonderful That wasnt
the problem

ANN
What was the problem

GRAHAM

The problem was me I wasI was
a pathological liar Or am I
should say Lying is like
alcoholism one is always
recovering

ANN
So you lied to her
GRAHAM
Yes I did Willfully and
repeatedly

ANN
How come

GRAHAM
I loved her for how good she made
me feel and I hated her for how
good she made me feel And at that
time I tended to express my
feelings non-verbally I couldnt
handle anyone having that much
control over my emotions

ANN
And now you can

GRAHAM
Now I make sure that no one has
the opportunity to test me

ANN
Dont you get lonely

GRAHAM
How could I with all these nice
people stopping by The fact is
that Ive lived by myself for so
long I cant imagine living with
another person Its amazing what
you can get used to if enough time
goes by And anyway Im asking
the questions Are you happy

ANN
I dont know anymore I thought
I was but obviously I was wrong

GRAHAM
Did you confront John with the
fact that you knew about him

ANN
Not yet Im not sure I will I
just want out

GRAHAM
If you do get out of your marriage
will you continue to be inhibited
ANN
I dont know It all gets back
to that Cynthia thing I dont
like hereagerness Theres
nothing left to imagine theres
no

GRAHAM
Subtlety

ANN

Subtlety yes No subtlety Plus
Ive never really felt able to
open up with anyone I mean that
other person I told you about

I enjoyed making love with him

a lot but I still wasnt able

to really let go I always feel
like Im being watched and I
shouldnt embarrass myself

GRAHAM
And you feel the same way with
John

ANN
Kind of I mean Johns like this
kind ofcraftsman Like hes
a carpenter and he makes really
good tables But thats all he
can make and I dont need anymore
tables

GRAHAM
Interesting analogy

ANN
Im babbling

GRAHAM
No youre not

ANN
(thinking)
God I m so mad at him

GRAHAM
You should be He lied to you
So did Cynthia

ANN
Yeah I know but somehow I expect
that from her I mean shell do
it with almost anybody I dont
know I shouldnt stick up for

her I guess but him He lied
sodeeply Ooo I want to watch
him die

Ann sits quietly for a moment Graham watches her
silently
The camera continues to roll

ANN
(looks up at Graham)
Youre really never going to make
love again

GRAHAM
Im not planning on it

A pause
ANN
If you were in love with me would
you
GRAHAM

Im not in love with you

ANN
But if you were

GRAHAM
II cant answer that precisely

ANN
But I feel like maybe I could be
really comfortable with you

GRAHAM
Thats very flattering

ANN
So why wont you make love with
me Why wouldnt you I mean

GRAHAM
Ann Are you asking me
hypothetically or are you asking
me for real right now

ANN
A pause

A pause

Im asking for real I want you
to turn that camera off and make
love with me Will you

GRAHAM
I cant

ANN
Why not

GRAHAM

Ive told you

ANN
But I dont understand--

GRAHAM
Ann it could happen to me all
over again dont you see I could
start to--

ANN
But how do you know for sure you
have to try to find a way to fig--

GRAHAM
I couldnt face her if I had slept
with somebody else

ANN
Who Elizabeth

GRAHAM
(uncomfortable)
Yes

ANN
You mean youre still in contact
with her

GRAHAM
No

ANN
But youre planning to be

GRAHAM
I dont know Possibly
ANN
Wait a minute wait a minute
Whats going on here Did you come
back here just to see her again

GRAHAM
Not entirely

ANN
But that was part of it

GRAHAM
Yes

ANN
Like maybe a big part

GRAHAM
Possibly

ANN
Graham I mean what do you think
her reaction is going to be if
you contact her

GRAHAM
I dont know

ANN
Look at you look at whats
happened to you look how youve
changed Dont you think she will
have changed

GRAHAM
I dont know I really would rather
not talk about it

ANN

(has to laugh)
Whoa Im so glad we got that
on tape You wont answer a
question about Elizabeth but I
have to answer all these intimate
questions about my sex life
Graham what do you think shes
going to make of all these
videotapes Are you going to tell
her about them I cant imagine
her being too understanding about
that But since you dont lie
anymore youll have to say
something

GRAHAM
As I said I havent decided what
to do exactly Perhaps I wont
do anything

ANN
Oh you just moved here to think
about it right

Graham says nothing Ann looks at him

ANN
Oh God Graham this is
sopathetic Youre not even
what you pretend to be youre
a lie youre a bigger lie than
you ever were

Graham sets the camera down though it continues to
record
He is visibly upset

GRAHAM
All right you want to talk about
lies lets talk about lies Ann
Lets talk about lying to yourself
You havent been able to sleep
with your husband because youre
no longer in love with him and
maybe you never were You havent
been honest with yourself in longer
than you can remember

ANN

(heated)
Yeah youre right But I never
claimed to know everything like
you and have all these little
theories Im still learning I
know that But I dont feel like
Ive wasted time If I had to go
through my marriage to get to where
I am right now fine

Ann moves in closer burrowing her eyes on fire

ANN
But you You have wasted nine
years I mean that has to be
some sort of weird record or
something nine years How does
that feel

Graham says nothing Ann picks up the camera and points
it at
him

GRAHAM
Dont do that

ANN
Why not

GRAHAM
Because

ANN
Because Thats not good enough
I asked you a question Graham
I asked you how does it feel
How does it feel Mr I Want To
Go Down On You But I Cant Do
you know how many people youve
sucked into your weird little
world Including me Come on
how does it feel

GRAHAM
I cant tell you like this

ANN
Im just going to keep asking until
you answer Im sure theres plenty
of tape

GRAHAM
I dont find this turning the
tables thing very interesting--

ANN
I dont care

Graham reaches up for the camera Ann knocks his hand
away

ANN
Not until I get some answers Tell
what you feel Not what you think
Ive heard plenty of that What
you feel
Graham is on the verge of completely falling apart

ANN
Come on

GRAHAM
All right All right You want
to know You want to know how
I feel I feel ashamed Is that
what you wanted to hear

A pause Graham regains his composure somewhat

ANN
Why are you ashamed

GRAHAM
Jesus Christ Ann Why is anybody
anything I think you have this
idea that people are either all
good or all bad and you dont
allow for any gray areas and
thats what most of us consist
of

ANN
Youre not answering me

GRAHAM
(heated)
Well what kind of answer are you
looking for Ann What is it
exactly that you want to know

ANN
I want to know why you are the
way you are

GRAHAM
And Im telling you its not any
one thing that I can point to and
say Thats why It doesnt work
that way with people who have
problems Ann its not that neat
its not that tidy Its not a
series of little boxes that you
can line up and count Things
just dont happen that way

ANN
But why cant you just put it all
behind you Cant you just forget
it All that stuff you did

GRAHAM

No Ann I cant I cant forget
it Its not something I can fix
Its difficult There s something
in my mindthe way my brain
works

frustrated)
God Ann when youre with another
person and you reinside
them youre so vulnerable youre
revealing so muchtheres no
protection Andsomebody could
say or do something to you while
you re in thisstate
ofnakedness And they could
hurt you without even knowing it
In a way that you couldnt even
see

(looks at Ann)
And you would withdraw To make
sure it didnt happen again

Ann looks at him for a long moment and then sets the
camera
down

She moves in front of Graham and kneels

ANN
I want to touch you

Graham shakes his head

ANN
I want to touch you

GRAHAM
No

Ann reaches out and Graham instinctively begins to
move away
Graham
Something in her voice makes him stop Their eyes lock

Graham
slowly moves back toward her
into his

Anns hand eases out to him her eyes still burning
Graham closes his eyes accepting Anns touch

She caresses him

Slowly

Delicately

She touches his arms his face his hair

Closing her eyes she takes his hand and puts it

She begins to lie him back on the couch When he offers
resistance she gently persists

ANN
Keep your eyes closed

Graham lies back silently obeying
Ann touches his face

Gradually her hand slips to his neck and she begins to
unbutton his shirt She watches his face hoping that

remain calm He does
She rubs her hand on his chest
Once again she brings Grahams hand to her face She

hand to her neck and throat painting her skin with his

Soon each hand is exploring the other Fingers search

Ann stands

Their hands remain together and Grahams eyes remain

She slowly moves both of her hands onto Grahams chest
move forward and back like a lazy tide

She looks at Graham His face is tranquil

Ann quietly begins to move her face toward his

Soon she is hovering inches above him her long hair
his features

She lowers her lips to his forehead and kisses him She
for a negative reaction Getting none she moves lower

A subtle movement from Graham Ann waits for a moment
She then moves to his lips her luxuriant tresses

She kisses him lightly

She kisses him again

Graham tilts his head back and she softly kisses his

Grahams hands make their way up Anns back until they
reached her neck He slowly pulls his face to hers

He kisses her

Graham is flooded with warmth and excitement

He caresses her intoxicating himself with physical

The kisses become more meaningful and the touching

Graham seizes up and abruptly backs away from Anns

Ann reaches for his hand He allows her to take it
GRAHAM

breeze her expression calm

Graham watches her go by

She stops in the middle of the room her back to him
