NIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON

by Lewis Abernathy

FADE IN

EXT ELM STREET - DAY

MEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion
Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze
The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases

DREAM CHILDREN
(in chorus)

One two Freddys coming for

you
On you there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
lightning only evil (Choice flashes from Nightmare on

Elm Street 1 and 2)

Meagan turns at 1665 A beautiful white two-story
house thick with lush green foliage Several beautiful
children all dressed in bright white play hopscotch
and jumprope on the front walk

DREAM CHILDREN
(continuing chanting)
Three four better lock your
door

Close on a little girls foot coming down on the number
4 drawn on concrete

Another RUMBLE and flash -- longer LOUDER (Flashes
from Nightmare 3 and 4)

Meagan continues up the walk the wind is blowing a
little harder now The trees are brown the leaves
peeling away

Moving up the walk closer to the house only now
its a little darker needs some paint On the front
porch a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle

DREAM CHILDREN
(continuing chanting)

Five six

RUMBLE Flash (Nightmare 5 and Freddys Dead)
DREAM CHILDREN
(continuing chanting)
Â»grab your crucifix ix ix

The ix echoes away becoming the faint Ka ka ka

we all recognize as Jasons theme Meagan turns to
find that the children in the yard have vanished Its
nighttime

The trees are dead the grass is gone and the horizon
stretches off into utter nothingness Meagan turns
back to the little girl

But the little girl has gone Only the tricycle
remains It circles once the front door CREAKS open
and the empty tricycle peddles inside Meagan follows
it into the

INT HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Meagan enters the house slowly watching as the tri-
cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears
Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan She
tries to open it -- locked

Then faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause She listens
trying to make out the low murmur Then a little girls
GIGGLE Meagan recognizes it as her sisters

MEAGAN
Lizzy

Meagan moves up the stairs going down the hall
following the voices (we recognize the other voice as
belonging to Freddy) Meagan enters a door at the
end of the hallway moving into

INT LIZZYS ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION

On the floor near her bed is Meagans thirteen year
old sister -- LIZZY Slow for her age Lizzy sits and
draws with crayons

MEAGAN
Lizzy What are you doing here

LIZZY
Playing with my friend

Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
of Freddy

MEAGAN
Your friend

LIZZY
He lives under the bed

Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
Lizzys bed

Suddenly a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
the bed flashing past Meagans face and running out
the door Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
tiny slash marks on her cheek Lizzy clucks

LIZZY
(continuing)
You scared him

Meagan looks out the door incredulous

MEAGAN
I scared him

But when Meagan looks back Lizzy is gone

MEAGAN
(continuing)
Lizzy

Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
in the

INT NIGHTMARE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into

a casket at the altar slamming the lid shut Meagan
goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid Inside
-- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling

all over it Meagan screams and slams the lid back
down

The casket starts to move -- THUMP THUMP THUMP
Then it stops Tentatively Meagan opens the lid again

Inside -- FREDDY KRUEGER He grabs her arm

FREDDY
Where ya been all my death baby
Meagan screams Freddy leaps out of the casket ina
tuxedo crooning

FREDDY
(continuing)
Ive been waitin at the altar for
a long long time

Meagan looks down -- shes wearing a wedding dress
spattered with blood Behind her the chapel has
filled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
of decay A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
asks

SATANIC PRIEST
Are the bridesmaids in attendance

Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets
dressed in body bags

SATANIC PRIEST
(continuing)
And the groomsmen

Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest

SATANIC PRIEST
(continuing)
If anyone here believes that these
two should not be joined in unholy
matrimony let him speak now or
forever rot in hell

From the back of the chapel a voice

JESSE
Meagan

Meagan turns Its her boyfriend -- JESSE He stands
in the chapel doorway backlit by bright light arms
outstretched

MEAGAN
Jesse

Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him their arms
encircling one another She looks up into Jesses

eyes only it isnt Jesse

Its Jason
Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete bringing
it down between her eyes

TRANSITION CUT TO

Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES she

was dreaming She gets up quickly and crosses to her
dresser She looks into the mirror at the tiny cuts

on her cheek and clucks Then she exits going into

INT LIZZYS ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Meagan opens the door to her sisters room breathing
a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
with a doll Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
she notices something not quite right about the doll
She moves closer and pulls Lizzys arm away to reveal
a hideous little Freddy doll Meagan gasps

MEAGAN
Freddy

Suddenly the doll opens its eyes and sneers

FREDDY DOLL
Well it aint Raggedy Ann bitch

The Freddy doll flashes its tiny glove of knives
thrusting them deep into Meagans chest

HARD CUT TO
INT MEAGANS ROOM - MORNING (for real)

Meagan sits up suddenly in bed clutching her chest
She looks down and sees that there is nothing there

Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad

with a start again Her fright turns to rage as she
pounds the alarm clock into submission Meagan climbs
out of bed

INT LIZZYS ROOM - MORNING

Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep clutching
her Raggedy Ann doll She gently pries the doll away
tossing it disdainfully away Meagan picks up a small
glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzys
head

MEAGAN
Wake up sleepy head Time to wake
up

Lizzys eyes flutter open She smiles at her sister
then frowns

LIZZY

As the sun rises on yet another

the standoff between police and the
mysterious group known only as the
Freddy cult who seized the abandoned

keep police at bay for almost two
weeks while inside they take mind-
altering narcotics in order to
communicate with their god --

RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper

NEWS REPORTER
Im standing here with State Trooper
Captain Renton Murdoch the man the
Governor has called in to deal with
the cultists because of his past
experience with occult-style
murderers In fact Trooper Murdoch
is the only law enforcement officer
ever to survive a one-on-one encounter
with notorious Camp Crystal Lake
killer -- Jason Voorhees

(to Murdoch)

You received some pretty nasty
injuries in your battle with Jason
didnt you Captain

MURDOCH
Nothing serious just a few
stitches

NEWS REPORTER
What about these so called Freddy
cultists They seem like pretty
tough customers Think youll have
any trouble getting them out of
there

MURDOCH
No Now that the Governor has given
me complete authority to deal with
these punks I should be putting an
end to their situation pretty quick
Unless of course their attorney is
able to get them to come out peace-
fully but I dont hold out much
hope for that

NEWS REPORTER

Captain Renton Murdoch ladies and
gentlemen A tough cop for tough
criminals

EXT FREDDY CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

Murdoch gets into the command car sitting down next
to the SWAT COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel

MURDOCH
Damn media oughtta be a law
(gestures to house)
Is that shyster still in there
trying to talk them out

SWAT COMMANDER

Yeah hes making them some kind
of deal

MURDOCH
Damn lawyers what a bunch of

assholes Shakespeare was right --
kill all the lawyers Then we could
kill all the punks with no hassles
and the world would be a safer place

SWAT COMMANDER
Smaller anyway

MURDOCH
Ahhhhh what did Shakespeare know
Long-haired English freak He was
probably a punk

INT CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME

Meanwhile inside the house the cults sleazy LAWYER
is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room
He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage

punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy
They stare out at him through sunglasses with red
flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
disfigured faces

The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
neatly on his lap Then he lifts his head wiping
his nose nervously as he speaks

SLEAZY LAWYER
So as I explained to you before
the revenues between the TV movie
deal and the book sale should be
adequate to fund your joint-defense
And I think with my mass media
hypnosis argument I could get each
of you a reduced sentence on appeal

-- say twenty years each Out
in fifteen with good behavior
Hmmmmm

HARD CUT TO
EXT CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

The lawyers disembodied head comes sailing out of
an upstairs window smacking into the command cars

WHACK -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
SWAT team move in The windows have been covered
with foil the walls have been painted black with
cult slogans written in red making the whole house
black as pitch The SWAT team puts on their
night vision goggles and starts moving through the
house
POV THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the SWAT
team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
the computer game DOOM) Then a blinding flash of
light and a SWAT guy goes down -- shot in the
face

Several of the cultists lead the attacking SWAT
team deeper into the house As one of the SWAT
guys follows his foot trips a wire A trap door
opens in the floor and the SWAT guy falls into
a pit waist deep in water Suddenly the water

starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- its
a tank of piranhas Two other SWAT guys grab
his arms and pull him out Too late -- his legs

have been shredded to the bone

Another SWAT guy kicks in a door to a room and
steps in FIRING his machine gun A large scythe
swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows
His arms fall to the floor still FIRING the machine
gun

The cultists race into a room grabbing handrailing
bolted over head They swing like monkeys across
the ceiling just as a SWAT guy charges into the
room behind them

LOSE ON SWAT GUYS BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
overed with upturned nails Several nails puncture
oth boots the points coming up through the laces

cultists as they try to escape out a window As

the last body pitches to the floor Murdoch yells

INT THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
house and most escape through the underground tunnel
just before the SWAT team comes BLASTING into
the basement As the last of the remaining cultists
is capped off a faint voice cries for help The
SWAT commander raises up his hand

SWAT COMMANDER
Hold your fire

He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
flashlight into the basement Through the dense
smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
to a chair sitting on a crate Underneath the chair
-- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer CLOSE
ON THE TIMER 30 29 28

SWAT COMMANDER

Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs

Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him He
mutters

MURDOCH

As the dust settles the SWAT commander rolls off
the little girl and starts checking her for injury
SWAT COMMANDER
Are you okay honey

Suddenly the little girl jumps onto the SWAT
commander flashing a glove of knives She hisses

LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
Freddy lives

With a quick swing the little girl slashes the
commanders face She dives back for a plunge to
his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off
He puts his boot on her holding her down as he
takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
style

SWAT COMMANDER
NO

The SWAT commander grabs Murdochs arm just in
time Several cops rush in and grab the girl
dragging her off kicking and screaming

SWAT COMMANDER
(continuing)
Jesus you were going to kill
that kid werent you

MURDOCH
I told you you were wasting your
time Once these kids go rabid
best thing to do is put em down

SWAT COMMANDER
You cant be serious

MURDOCH
Dead serious See the world is
made up of rules Kids dont like
rules They rebel for a while but
ultimately they start to fall in
line and become ordinary Joes like
you and me But some kids dope
smokers mainly watching their MTV
Satanic lyrics melting whats left
of their brains these kids grow
up to be punks And when these punks
step as far over the line as these
Freddy punks have -- then we as
peace officers have no choice but
to kill them

SWAT COMMANDER
I didnt become a peace officer to
kill kids

MURDOCH
Punks Theres a difference

We move from this to a small classroom window Through
it we see Meagan sitting in economics class The
instructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing

MISS KREPPS
(Blah-blah Blah-blah-blah)

Its hot Several of the kids fan themselves
struggling to stay awake while others have already
passed out on their desks Meagans eyes are heavy
She looks over at Jesse pretending to follow along
in his book fast asleep The antique oscillating
fan on Miss Krepps desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
on

MISS KREPPS
(continuing)
(Blah-blah-blah Blah-blah)

Meagan starts to drift off when

MISS KREPPS

MEAGAN
Yes maam

MISS KREPPS

your oral report

MEAGAN
Yes Im ready
MISS KREPPS

Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
snickers of some of her classmates Miss Krepps
snaps her fingers for quiet

MISS KREPPS
(continuing)

You wont think its funny when
you havent learned the fundamentals
of a free market economy oh

MEAGAN
My report is on Global Economic
Trends
(clears throat
begins reading)
Try and think of a world where there
is no poverty no sickness no
crime A world where everyone is
happy to be alive and everyone lives
together in peace This is my dream

The fan on Miss Krepps desk starts to CLICK louder
BLOWING harder Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
with her report

MEAGAN
(continuing)
This dream is becoming a reality
with ever-growing international
business

CLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes getting creepier
turning into a Freddy-fan BLOWING harder CLICKING
louder

MISS KREPPS
Louder Meagan We cant hear you

Meagan repeats the last few sentences raising her
voice to be heard over the fan Then pages of her
report start to blow away She grabs at them as the
WIND increases

A bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
spills to the floor at Meagans feet She bends over
to pick it up when her skirt blows up She presses
it down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
billows up revealing her underwear The class roars
with laughter

MISS KREPPS
(continuing)
Louder Meagan we still cant
hear you

But Meagan isnt reading her report anymore shes
busy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP --
the WIND blows her skirt off Her classmates fall
over themselves laughing RIP -- Meagans blouse
blows away She tries to hide behind the podium when
that too is swept off

Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
to drift away -- thread by thread She is almost
naked Meagan looks up at her classmates red in the
face

Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
all a bunch of old rotten skeletons And up front
in the center where Miss Krepps sat is Freddy He

wears a beanie with a propeller points and laughs

FREDDY
Aww all dressed up and nowhere
to blow

Meagan screams clutching at the last few tiny strands
of cloth that cover her body She calls to Jesse
pleading

MEAGAN
Jesse please help me
But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead He reaches

up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale
expressionless face

FREDDY
Looks like a photo opportunity to
me

Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
flashgun attached The flash bulb is the size of a
beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
front Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
sneers
FREDDY

(continuing)
Say cheesecake
PHOOMPH -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
light Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
against the blackboard -- vaporized

HARD CUT TO

Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly The classroom
as normal Miss Krepps is standing over her asking

MISS KREPPS
Meagan Meagan

Meagan looks around bewildered and confused

MISS KREPPS

Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
herself together

MEAGAN
But this one was different it

SCHOOL NURSE
But thats just it Meagan dreams

fragments of the subconscious mind

MEAGAN
Fear is real though isnt it And
if nightmares are fear then doesnt
that make them real
(gets excited)
And if the nightmares are real then
is reality like a dream

SCHOOL NURSE
(cutting her off)
Meagan Youve got heat prostration

The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
nurses office muttering under her breath

MEAGAN
Old witch what does she know
Meagan

She isnt even qualified to give a
shot and shes telling me that my
dreams arent anything to worry
about

JESSE
So she said you were okay

MEAGAN
Oh sure Madame Curie in there

stration and an overdose of TV news

Meagan pours through a big psychology book Across
the table Jesse peers into another psychology book

MEAGAN
Find anything

Jesse looks up suddenly

JESSE
What Oh no nothing yet

Over Jesses shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD and
TRACK tucked inside his psychology book

MEAGAN
Did you know that our sub-conscious
retains everything that ever happened
to us Everything From the time
were born until we die

JESSE
Really

MEAGAN
Thats how Freddy gets at us
by using our sub-conscious fears
Fears our conscious minds have
repressed or forgotten

JESSE
Ive got a news flash for you
Freddys dead

MEAGAN
Im not so sure if Freddy exists
in our sub-conscious then he can
never be fully erased Like a bad
memory you may blot it out of
your mind but it will alway be
hiding someplace in your dreams
(off Jesses
disbelieving stare)
Werent you scared as a child by
something so stupid that youre
ashamed to admit it

JESSE
No

MEAGAN
No

JESSE
Well yeah

MEAGAN

Well what What is it

JESSE
Well when I was kid my brother
took me to the carnival And in the
penny arcade there was this robot
gunslinger

MEAGAN
Black Bart

JESSE
You know about Black Bart

MEAGAN
Duh You put your quarter in and he
says Go ahead and draw tenderfoot
And then you pull your gun out and
shoot him

JESSE
Thats just it -- I never could
Id point the gun right at him and
shoot and I could never hit the guy
So I always got killed

MEAGAN
No one can hit him -- its a gyp

JESSE
Scared the shit out of me

Meagan tries to hide her smile
JESSE
(continuing
flustered)
Isnt that scary I mean fora

Meagan laughs Somebody shushes her

JESSE

(continuing

mad)
Okay smartass what about you

A dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back

MEAGAN

I remember Lizzy wandered off

yard Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
bumps into a passing CULTIST The cultist pushes him
down as he follows after Lizzy

LEONARD

Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
shes being followed She turns and sees a cultist
standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her
Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
glances back the figure is still standing but
closer

Scared Lizzy turns and runs dropping her books as
she flees down the sidewalk As she comes to the
street a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
of her the door swinging open wide Burned arms
reach out to grab Lizzy She screams

The cultists grab Lizzy pulling her into the car as
it roars off down the street

Meagans mother bellows from the living room where
she is talking to a policeman taking notes She is
drunk and has been crying

MEAGANS MOM

Meagans mom breaks down sobbing

MEAGAN

MEAGANS DAD
She didnt come home from school
today The police got a report that
a girl fitting Lizzys description
was forced into a car by some
crazies Theyre pretty sure it was
this Freddy cult

MEAGAN
(shocked)
Oh my God

Meagans dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to
comfort her

MEAGANS DAD
Now dont worry The police are
doing everything they can

Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his
men when a voice from upstairs calls down

TROOPER
(0S)
Hey Capn better have a look
up here

INT LIZZYS ROOM - NEXT SECOND

As Murdoch enters he spots Lizzys night table and
the small glass menagerie there Murdoch picks up
the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
attention to the floor next to the bed

Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy
including one that has Freddy Lives scrawled across
the top

Meagan enters and sees the drawings She gasps

TROOPER
Looks like she was in the cult all
along

MEAGAN
No no she wouldnt do that
Lizzy wouldnt join Freddys cult

TROOPER
I know its hard to believe miss
But a lot of good kids get caught
up in this kind of trouble

Murdoch stares at the drawings his jaw muscles
tightening He clenches his fist pulverizing the
little unicorn

MURDOCH
Punks

Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
the table as he exits the room brushing past Meagan
INT MEAGANS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Meagans dad follows Murdoch to the door asking
MEAGANS DAD

Murdoch and his men say good-bye and quickly exit

EXT MEAGANS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

As the last of the cops drive away Meagan pulls
Jesse out of the house

JESSE
Where are we going

MEAGAN
Over to Stormies

JESSE
Stormie I thought you and her werent
friends anymore since she stole that
twenty dollars from you

MEAGAN
That was her klepto phase when
she was dating that gang member
She dumped him a long time ago

JESSE
I still dont understand What has
she got to do with Lizzy missing

MEAGAN

She used to be in the Freddy cult
Maybe she knows where they took
Lizzy

They exit to Jesses car
CUT TO
INT STORMIES ROOM - AFTERNOON

Meagans high-strung best friend -- STORMIE -- is
blurting out at a mile-a-minute

STORMIE
If I did know I would call the
police you know that I love Lizzy
No telling what those freaks will
do to her Those Freddy cult guys
are hard core

JESSE
I thought you were in the cult

STORMIE
I was in the cult for a week cause
my boyfriend at the time Slasher
he was But I just liked the music
and the clothes when they were
clean but not like the violence
and stuff But that was just my
cult phase but I got past that
You know just like my gang phase
when I was dating Ramon and then
before that was my death rock
phase when I was dating Stuart

JESSE
Uh excuse me but what phase
are we in now

STORMIE

Militant feminist man-hating phase
whats it fuckin to ya

JESSE
(to Meagan)
Why dont you just let the cops find
her That guy Renton Murdoch -- he
knows how to deal with these cultist
psychos He was the man who got Jason
Voorhees

MEAGAN
That guy in my dreams
STORMIE
Jason kicked his ass

QUICK CUT TO

EXT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SOME YEARS AGO - NIGHT

Jesse narrates a short fuzzy silent flashback as

younger-looking Renton Murdoch is BLASTING away at
Jason in panic

JESSE
(V0)
Well yeah But Murdoch put
thirteen bullets in Jason before
he hacked his head open

Jason cleaves Murdochs head with a machete Murdoch
staggers back raising his pistol

JESSE
(V0O
continuing)
But even with his head hacked open
and his brains leaking out Murdoch
still managed to put his last bullet
in Jasons eye

Murdoch FIRES the bullet SMACKING Jason in the eye
Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdochs
body hits the ground

INT HOSPITAL ROOM-

Murdoch lays in a bed his head covered in bandages
Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of
medical contraptions

STORMIE

(V0)
Well one of my moms boyfriends
worked at the hospital where they
took him He said that Murdoch lost
more than half his brain and what
little that was left was all twisted
up inside And they had to replace
his skull with a metal plate to
keep that from leaking out

In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdochs
eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us
STORMIE
(V0O
continuing)
They say he hasnt been the same
since

CUT BACK TO
INT STORMIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

JESSE
So whats different about him

STORMIE
One thing he used to be a
Democrat Now he votes straight
Republican

MEAGAN

I think he thinks Lizzy joined the
cult or something

STORMIE
Oh my God hell kill her

MEAGAN
Ive got to find Lizzy myself Ive
got to find her and save her from
Freddy before that crazy cop kills
her

JESSE
Just where are you going to look
I mean these cult guys could be
holding her anywhere

MEAGAN
Murdoch said something about going
to talk to somebody named Erwin

STORMIE
Erwin Kelper He used to be in the
Freddy cult I bet he knows where
they took Lizzy

JESSE
Not Squirmin Erwin -- that freak
that used to eat bugs

STORMIE
(annoyed)
Who else
(to Meagan bright)

Erwin is scary smart -- always brought
home As -- but he was kinda fucked
up too I mean who isnt really

Anyway he quit the cult a few months
back and the cops put him away for
his own safety They say Freddys

put a death hex on Erwin

JESSE
A death hex
STORMIE
Yes a death hex You know where

someone wants you dead

MEAGAN
Where is he

CuT TO
EXT SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON

Jesse Meagan and Stormie pull past the large sign
and into the parking lot As Jesse puts the car in
park Meagan turns to him and says

MEAGAN
I want you to stay here

JESSE
Why
MEAGAN
Dont be mad its just that you

might scare him

JESSE
Scare him

STORMIE
What shes subtly trying to tell
you is that this needs a womans

gentle touch butthead
MEAGAN
Just stay here okay

Jesse grudgingly agrees Meagan kisses Jesse on the
cheek Stormie sticks her tongue out at him then
turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance
INT SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

The CRIES of the insane echo through the building as
the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a
row of cell doors He stops at one tapping lightly
on the glass

SECURITY GUARD
Yo Erwin youve got a couple
of visitors Now be a good boy
(to Meagan and Stormie)
Youve got five minutes Ill be
right down the hall if you need me

The guard exits Meagan and Stormie peer through the
thick window -- Erwins padded cell appears vacant
They exchange anxious looks then Meagan presses a
little closer to the glass

MEAGAN
Erwin

SPLAT -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
face to the glass as he screams

ERWIN
SHOW ME YOUR ARMS YOUR ARMS

Meagan and Stormie jump back startled Then they
quickly bare their arms turning them over for Erwins
inspection

ERWIN
(continuing)
Where do you shoot

MEAGAN
Shoot

STORMIE
Hes talking about dream dope --
the stuff the cultists shoot up
with so they can talk to Freddy

MEAGAN
I dont do drugs

ERWIN
Youre not in the cult
MEAGAN
No

ERWIN
Didnt Freddy send you to kill me

MEAGANSTORMIE
No
ERWIN
I dont trust you better take off

your clothes so I can check you for
tracks

STORMIE
Chill Erwin Were here for some
hard data -- not a floppy disk

Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket gesturing
to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small

mattress

ERWIN
Well what do you want Cant you
see Im busy

MEAGAN
Freddys cult kidnapped my sister

STORMIE
told her you might know where
they took her

ERWIN

know

MEAGAN
Tell me please
ERWIN
Look Im sorry about your sister

but Ive got my own problems with
Freddy Im a marked man you know

MEAGAN
Then tell me why they took her

ERWIN
To bear his child Freddy wants to
be human again In order to do that
he has to be reborn
MEAGAN
How can he do that

ERWIN
He has to marry a virgin on holy
ground Then the cult consumate
the marriage by impregnating her

STORMIE
The whole cult Yeech

ERWIN

Freddys the son of a hundred maniacs
Its sort of a tradition with him

MEAGAN
So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant

ERWIN
And Freddy enters the soul of the

fetus through a dream state Voila
Rebirth

There is a moment as the girls take this in then

STORMIE
Thats the stupidest shit I ever
heard

ERWIN
Hey theyre not my rules some-

body else wrote âem

MEAGAN
Erwin youve got to help me find
Lizzy Youre my only hope

Erwin thinks about this for a second then
ERWIN

MEAGAN
Anything Just name it

ERWIN
You have to help me kill Freddy

Meagan and Stormie exchange looks
STORMIE
But Freddys dead

ERWIN
Freddy lives
(looks at Meagan)
If only in our dreams

Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
her away

STORMIE
Come on Meagan our five minutes
is up Hes giving me the creeps

But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin

MEAGAN
How can you kill a dream

ERWIN
When its not a dream
(then)
Do we have a deal

Erwin presses his palm against the glass Meagan
thinks a moment then puts her hand against the glass
over his

MEAGAN
Deal

MEAGAN
Theyll never believe that Come

JESSE

Okay okay Ill do it
(to Stormie)
And Im not a wimp

Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth After a
moments hesitation Jesse steps out and immediately
both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
the call Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
girls shut up he says

JESSE
(continuing)
I need a quarter for the phone

Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him Jesse
re-enters the booth

ANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number

INT SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT
The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS

his voice)
Theres a bomb planted in your
building

SECURITY GUARD
Who is this

JESSE
If I were you -- Id get my ass
out of there

In the background we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
something to Jesse

JESSE
(continuing adding)
Oh yeah Freddy Lives

CLICK -- The guards eyes grow wide

EXT SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER

The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
fire ALARM Soon all the INMATES start filing out
into the yard loosely herded by the GUARDS Erwin
files out with the others still wearing his straight
jacket

Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesses car
flashes its lights Erwin starts to casually wander
off towards the fence between himself and freedom
when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says

SECURITY GUARD
Hey Erwin where do you think
youre going

Erwin ignores him still moving towards the fence

SECURITY GUARD
(continuing)
Im talking to you asshole

Erwin breaks into a run The guard takes off after
him

In the car Jesse Meagan and Stormie watch as the
guard closes the distance

JESSE
Hes not going to make it
MEAGAN
Weve got to do something

With grim determination Jesse starts his car

Jesses car tears out of the parking lot racing for
the fence With a loud metallic CHING Jesses car
drives into the fence knocking that section down
Erwin dances over the downed chain-link diving into
an open window Then with a SQUEAL of tires and the
RENDING of metal Jesses car backs out of the fence
does a 180 and PEELS off

ANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
of his straight jacket Once freed Erwin extends his
hand to Jesse

ERWIN
Hi my names Erwin Thanks for
busting me out of there

Jesse looks at Erwins outstretched hand -- the
fingertips are all heavily bandaged

JESSE
Yeah right Look Erwin just do
me one favor -- dont eat nothing

disgusting My stomach is tight
enough as it is

The security guard runs up to the fence huffing and
puffing watching as Jesses car disappears down the
street Then he spots something in the fence and
plucks it out

Jesses front license plate

INT ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - DUSK

CLOSE ON LIZZY screaming and crying as the cultists
close in around her They rip her sleeve off and
inject her with a syringe After a moment Lizzy
starts to settle down falling asleep

The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
her towards the big boiler Inside -- a raging INFERNO

LIZZYS DREAM STATE POV -- as the cultists reach
the boiler it splits open in the middle like a giant
gate The two halves swing open wide to reveal
INT HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop

a tall narrow mountain On either side of the ledge
is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
of hot molten lava stretching out for miles filled
with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING Hundreds upon
hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
terrible chorus of the damned

The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
the mausoleum The outside of this ancient structure
is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
mankind In the center -- a large iron gate that
swings open as the cultists near

The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms holding
her tight as they push her face forward into the
mirror The glass gives way like mercury Lizzys
face disappearing into the mirror

ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzys
face stares out into utter blackness Then some-
thing large and evil looking swims up out of the

darkness Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by

the sides of the face as the huge monstrous head

moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
out

The evil thing gives Lizzy a big wet French kiss
locking its lips over hers Several slippery some-
things slither into her mouth Lizzy struggles but
the big evil thing is way too strong Finally it
releases her and the cultists pull her back out

The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
the

INT ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
conscious state Her eyes grow wide with fear again
as she opens her mouth to scream Suddenly she
doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
cultist thrusts under her

Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzys
mouth -- the Dream Demons
EXT OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK

Several shadows flee into the night as Jesses car
pulls up next to a run-down building

INT ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Erwin leads Meagan Jesse and Stormie down into the
old burnt out boiler room They work their way
towards the back to a large table and a collection
of sofas and easy chair scattered about Erwin
starts sniffing around pointing out several used
syringes laying scattered about the floor

ERWIN
Damn We must have just missed them

Meagan spots Lizzys shirt sleeve on the floor

MEAGAN
Oh my God -- she was here This
is part of Lizzys shirt Its all
torn

(grabs Erwin)

Erwin weve got to find her

ERWIN
Were too late Theres no way
except

MEAGAN
Except what

ERWIN

We could go after Freddy

MEAGAN
How

Erwin goes to a boiler bends down and reaches way

up underneath After fishing around for a moment

he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
box Inside -- a vile of liquid several syringes
and several pairs of cult shades

ERWIN
Well inject ourselves with Dream
Dope Its a mild narcotic that
brings on a dreamlike state
Meagan thinks about this for a moment then nods her
approval

MEAGAN
Okay lets do it
JESSE
Meagan we dont do drugs I mean
what if one of us gets hooked or
something
(whispers)

We could turn out like him
Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin

ERWIN
Dont worry about it We need you
wide awake anyway

JESSE
What for

ERWIN
Were going to go under and try to
find Freddy When we do well grab
him and bring him here Then you
kill him with this

Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver
JESSE

This rusty chunk of shit What
good is this

ERWIN
Its not the gun its whats in
it -- silver bullets blessed by a
priest

JESSE

Will that work

ERWIN
(shrugs)
Should But then

JESSE

(finishes for him)
You dont make the rules yeah
yeah

MEAGAN
What should we do

ERWIN
Have a seat over there and make
yourselves comfortable Roll up
your sleeves and put these on

Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens
Stormie puts hers on immediately and says

STORMIE
Oh cool

MEAGAN
What are they for

ERWIN
Its how the cult keeps in constant
contact with Freddy The little
lights flashing are a sustained
occular input that causes your brain
to resonate at approximately the
same frequency at which the dream
state is most likely to occur

All of this went over Meagans head Stormie shrugs

STORMIE
Whatever
(to Meagan excited)
Put em on -- theyre really cool

Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs rolling
up their sleeves Erwin comes over and reclines the
chairs giving each girl an injection Then Erwin
takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself He
lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
glasses

ERWIN
It helps to hold hands if you want
to go together

Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie Jesse
watches with skepticism and concern Erwin ushers
a final warning

ERWIN
(continuing)
And remember Freddy knows what

scares you
Then all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into

Meagan Stormie and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
pictures) with rusty catwalks huge out-of-proportion
fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below As
they get to their feet Meagan hears Lizzys voice

LIZZY
(distant)
Meagan help me please

Meagan enters a shaft following the sound when
suddenly the shaft closes up behind her Stormie
and Erwin try to find the opening again but cant

ERWIN
Freddys trying to split us up

INT ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

Jesse is standing in front of an old full length
mirror practicing drawing the pistol He pulls it
and pretends to fire blowing imaginary smoke from
the muzzle as he says

JESSE

Okay Freddy theres a new sheriff

INT NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT
Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
boiler room calling for Meagan A strange shadow
stalks them -- its Freddy He drops down in front
of Erwin and Stormie

FREDDY
Looking for some-body

Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
lost souls In the center -- Meagan Stormie charges
Freddy throwing her arms around him as she screams

to Erwin

STORMIE
Ive got him Wake us up Wake
us up

But Erwin is paralyzed with fear

STORMIE
(continuing)
Dont just stand there Wake us up

FREDDY
Hmmmmm I feel like seafood tonight

Suddenly Stormies arms have become huge lobster
claws She jerks away from Freddy but too late --
Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman

Freddy smiles -- now hes wearing a chefs hat and
apron
FREDDY
(continuing)

Stew on this bitch

Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side She
falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH

Well well well if it isnt

Erwin stares wide-eyed frozen to the spot

FREDDY

Suddenly Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
out a pin Freddy gawks -- surprised Erwin pricks
his finger

HARD CUT TO

INT ELM STREET - DAY (DREAM)

Meagan comes down the sidewalk still following

It leads her to her house Meagan enters the front
door

Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen
table reading his paper The headline reads

MEAGAN
Daddy

He looks up and quietly shushes her

MEAGANS DAD
Shuuuuu Im trying to be invisible

And with that Meagans dad disappears Only the
newspaper remains Then Meagan hears Lizzys VOICE
again upstairs

As she comes down the upstairs hallway Meagan passes
her mothers room The door is open a crack Meagan
looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle

to her lips The bottle sucks the life out of Meagans
mom who shrivels up into an ugly ol prune face

Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzys cry
for help draws her to

INT LIZZYS ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Meagan enters She sees Lizzy on her bed under the
covers

Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is
pregnant her naked swollen stomach protruding from
her night gown Something inside is trying to push

its way out

Lizzy screams Meagan moves to help her sister when
Freddys glove BURSTS OUT of Lizzys stomach stabbing
Meagan in the chest

HARD CUT TO

Meagan wakes up suddenly She looks up at Stormie
Erwin and Jesse standing over her
STORMIE
Are you okay

They help Meagan to her feet

MEAGAN
(shaky)
He got away I had him and he
got away Oh God Lizzy I
lost her
ERWIN

Well atleast youre not dead

MEAGAN
No Im not dead
(realizes)
No Im not But Freddy killed me
STORMIE

He killed me too But look

Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is
unharmed Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him
Meagan gets to her feet asking

MEAGAN
Now that I think about it -- hes
killed me in all my nightmares But
Im not dead what does it mean

ERWIN
It means weve still got some time
left Until his remains are host to

the Dream Demons -- Freddy cant
hurt us

JESSE
Hello The Dream Demons

ERWIN
Freddy made a pact with Satan when
he died so Satan bestowed upon

him the Dream Demons Theyre the
source of Freddys power to manipulate
our physical reality Without them
hes powerless -- nothing more than
a bad dream
(off Jesses cynical

look)
Hey like I said I dont make
the rules

MEAGAN
But weve still got a chance right
A chance to kill Freddy before he
gets back his power

ERWIN
We already tried that Theres no
way for us to kill Freddy Hes too
clever He knows how to get to us

MEAGAN
Then lets get somebody else Some-
body strong

STORMIE
Yeah We could hire somebody to
kill Freddy -- like a hit man
ERWIN
You would have to hire a thousand
of them or one really big guy

who isnt afraid of anything No
fear Nada Then you got a shot

JESSE
Where are you going to find a hit
man The yellow pages In your
dreams

Jesses last three words strike Meagan like a thunder-
bolt and she stammers out a name

MEAGAN
Jason

JESSE
Jason

MEAGAN

Jason Voorhees

ERWIN
(brightens)
Jason Voorhees thats brilliant
The perfect dream warrior no fear
STORMIE

Sounds like our man

JESSE
Uh excuse me Einstein but
isnt Jason Voorhees dead

ERWIN
Seriously dead Buried up by Crystal
Lake somewhere But dont worry I
know how to bring him back to life

JESSE
Somehow I just knew you would

ERWIN
But thats not the problem The
problem is control Once we bring
Jason back from the dead Im not
one hundred percent sure hell do
what we tell him

STORMIE
Well thats okay as long as he
doesnt chop us all up

Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain

MEAGAN
Erwin Im trusting you on this
so tell me the truth Do you think
if we do this -- if we go and get
Jason and bring him back to life
that he could kill Freddy

ERWIN
No doubt about Jason could wreck
Freddy on this side of the Dreamline
But if Freddy has home court advan-
tage I dont know Too close to
call The trick would be to get Jason
to enter a dream state grab Freddy
and drag him out to our reality

MEAGAN
I havent got a choice Ive got to
try something
(turns to Stormie and

Jesse)
I cant ask either of you to help
me do this its illegal immoral
disgusting

STORMIE

Hey we sisters have to stand
together right Where you lead --
Ill follow Count me in
Meagan embraces Stormie then all three turn to Jesse
He looks them over and sighs

JESSE
Let me get this straight were
going to go dig one dead maniac up
to fight another dead maniac

ERWIN
Thats about the size of it and
Id be doing you a disservice if I
said there werent a modicum of risk

involved
JESSE

Meagan I dont want to do this
MEAGAN

You dont have to Jesse its not

your fight I understand

JESSE
But I damn sure dont want you to
do it without me Count me in

she pushes him away

In his shack listening to a small portable radio
is the NIGHT WATCHMAN His small DOG suddenly perks
up her ears and GROWLS low The watchman turns down
the radio

NIGHT WATCHMAN
Whats matter girl you hear
somethin

Then the old man hears it too A low RUMBLE Moving
closer

The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
into the darkness when a line of several hearses
approaches The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
the drivers window rolls down
NIGHT WATCHMAN
(continuing)
Whats this A funeral procession

A Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
and says

CULTIST
Thats exactly what it is

NIGHT WATCHMAN
(suspicious)
Yeah Whose

CULTIST
Yours

BANG -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
the head The night watchman falls to the ground with
a lifeless THUD The little dog starts BARKING
ferociously when another SHOT silences her as well

Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
the gate cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
cutters He swings the gate open and the funeral
procession proceeds inside

INT SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - A SHORT TIME LATER

The cultists are standing around a small pit that two
cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
wrecking yard Inside the pit the uncovered remains
of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
charred bones

Lizzy is brought forward held by a couple cultists
and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
around She no longer struggles accepting her fate
with droopy eyes

LIZZYS DREAM DOPE POV -- as she watches one of
the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
Freddys broken jawbone Her vision gets blurry
more surreal as another cult member steps forward
with the tupperware He pours the dream demons into

CLOSE ON FREDDYS REMAINS as the dream demons swim
around inside his skull His bones start to bleed
blood becoming arteries and veins vessels becoming
muscle muscle growing scarred flesh

There is a FLASH from the pit Then suddenly Freddy
Krueger -- as youve known him as youve loved him --
leaps out of the pit and cries

FREDDY
Smokin

Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints The cultists
FIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the
building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding
them HONK their HORNS and FLASH their LIGHTS

reads CRYSTAL LAKE - 13 MILES

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT

Jesse pulls the car into an ol run-down service
station

STORMIE
I dont think theyre open

MEAGAN
It says open all night

Jesse HONKS the horn and yells
JESSE
Hey Can we get some service out

STORMIE

Suddenly a CRAZY OL COOT appears on the opposite
side with a shotgun Everyone in the car jumps

CRAZY OL COOT

CRAZY OL COOT

The old man gives the occupants of the car a going
over with his one good eye hesitating a moment over
Erwin who scrunches down in the back seat hiding
under a baseball cap

CRAZY OL COOT
Youre not goin up there to do
somethin stupid are you

JESSE
(laughs nervous)
Stupid Like what

CRAZY OL COOT
Like dig up Jason Voorhees --

Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold
busted Then they start saying No No and shaking
their heads innocently in a big performance that
wouldnt fool a stick

JESSE
(looks at Meagan)
Jesus why would anyone do that

CRAZY OL COOT

I dunno but people do
STORMIE

CRAZY OL COOT
More times than I care to remember

MEAGAN
Well were just doing an article
for our high school newspaper about
the dangers of breaking into
cemeteries at night You know
stuff that can get you hurt

The ol coot scans the foursome again closely as he
acquiesces

CRAZY OL COOT

Well okay as long as youre
not going up there to do something
stupid

(pointing)

Take this road up about a mile and
make a left at the ol saw mill
That road will take you right on
in Eternal Peace Cemetery --

Jesse is already standing on the gas leaving the
ol coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust

EXT ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL
PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign TRESPASSERS
WILL BE SHOT

Meagan Jesse Stormie and Erwin enter the shadowy
cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their
shoulders As they search through the cemetery
Meagan asks

MEAGAN
Whats the story on Jason Voorhees
anyway

STORMIE

Where have you been Jason was that
guy who ran around in a hockey mask
chopping up camp counselors duh

MEAGAN
I knew that What I mean was why

ERWIN
It started a long time ago back in
the fifties when Jason drown at
Camp Crystal Lake His mother went
berserk and started killing the
counselors

STORMIE
She got her head chopped off by one
of the girls she was trying to kill

ERWIN
Right And then Jason came back from
his watery grave to get revenge

JESSE
He came back from the grave

ERWIN
Yeah Chopped up a number of people
before they finally caught up to him

MEAGAN
What happened to him then

ERWIN
They killed him

JESSE
How can you kill somebody whos
back from the grave

ERWIN
Not very well apparently Jason
keeps coming back to life and
chopping people up Its a never
ending cycle of terror up here at
Crystal Lake -- a real problem
MEAGAN
Why does he keep coming back to
life and killing people

ERWIN
They say hes looking for revenge
on the camp counselor who murdered
him as a child Jason just happens
to go about it in the socially
unacceptable way of hacking through
every teenager he finds until he
gets the right one

(spots grave)
Here it is

Erwin shines his light on Jasons grave

ANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES Born1945
Died1953

Beneath the death date crudely scratched into the
stone 1981 1982 1984 1985 1986 1988 etc

Jesse and Erwin start digging

ELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig
Stormie and Meagan take their turn Then Jesse
hits something solid

Hands brush away the remaining dirt exposing the
coffin below Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open

The casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS --
noxious gas escapes Everyone covers their mouth
and nose suppressing the urge to hurl

Then roaches hundreds of roaches

Meagan and Stormie run off screaming batting at
their hair and clothing Jesse rolls around on
the ground Erwin sighs plucks a roach off his
shirt and calmly eats it

CUT TO
EXT ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - A SHORT TIME LATER
Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave

holding the light and a can of bug spray Their
hair is up covered in plastic shower caps Duct
tape around the cuffs of their pants They arent
taking anymore chances with bugs

Jesse and Erwin open the casket Everyone recoils
at the stench Then they shine their lights inside
-- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey
mask

CUT TO

The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of
Jason into the trunk of Jesses car and slamming
the lid closed

Everyone piles into the car exhausted

In the back Erwin picks his nose unaware that
Stormie is watching him her mouth gaping in horror
Erwin becomes aware of Stormies sickened scrutiny
and pulls out his finger presenting it to Stormie

ERWIN
Look the boogerman
(laughs)
Get it

Stormie slaps his hand away

STORMIE
Get back you nasty-ass bastard
Ug I thought I had seen the last
of those when my brother graduated
third grade

ERWIN
We just dug up a rotting corpse and
youre worried about a little snot

Jesse looks over at Meagan curled up in a ball
beside him She purrs

MEAGAN
Im exhausted wake me when we
get back home

ERWIN
Uhhh better not fall asleep --
weve still got a lot of work to
do and Freddys out there waiting

This news sobers everyone up immediately
STORMIE
Well that means weve all got to
stay awake

JESSE
Duh

MEAGAN
I know Well sing a song
(starts singing)
Row Row Row your boat gently down
the stream Merrily merrily merrily
merrily life is but a dream Come

Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another
chorus of Row Your Boat as Jesses car roars off into
the night

DISSOLVE TO
EXT LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

Meagan is leaning up against the door murmuring softly
to herself as she drifts off to sleep

MEAGAN
merrily merrily merrily
merrily life is but a dream

In the back seat Erwin is nuzzled between Stormies
breasts sucking his thumb Both are fast asleep

Jesse stares at the road ahead his own eyelids
drooping The car starts to weave

ANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding
a cardboard sign by the side of the road WILL KILL
FOR FOOD

Jesse shakes his head -- nah He tries to concentrate
on the road his eyelids falling once more

Jesses car zooms past a billboard Behind the bill-
board -- a highway patrol car a radar gun sticking
out of the drivers window

CLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesses car passes in the back-
ground the red digits cascading up

Freddy now dressed as a highway patrolman sits behind
the wheel The radar guns display is reflected in
his mirrored shades It reads KILL THEM

FREDDY
Shouldnt dream and drive

Freddy starts the car and pulls out but what comes
out from behind the billboard isnt a patrol car --
its Freddys NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
belching HELLFIRE

ANGLE IN JESSES REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesses eyelids
close and his head nods forward revealing the night-
maremobile closing from behind fast

The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesses
car just an inch from the bumper Freddy moves one
of the dozen of levers on the dash

CLOSE ON FREDDYS HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version

of Freddys glove It extends out towards the back
of Jesses car one of the tiny knives inserting into
the trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK The
trunk lid opens

ANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jasons
remains are moving Freddy works another level and
the tiny glove slits each bag The various pieces
of Jason (hands boots intestines etc) crawl out
of the bag

FREDDY
(continuing)
Looks like the cats out of the
bag now

Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk

The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesses
car BANGING into the rear quarter panel WHAM --
all four occupants of the car are jolted awake
startled Meagan looks out her window and sees the
nightmaremobile as it closes in again

MEAGAN
Its Freddy

WHAM SPARKS fly Everyone screams Freddy laughs

as he falls back for another shot Meagan sees the
dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
maremobile staring out at her through the back window
A small yellow sign reads LOST SOULS ON BOARD
Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly
he pieces of Jason ATTACK BURSTING from behind the
ack seat One hand crawls up the back of the front
eat leaping onto Jesses throat Jasons intestines
XPLODE out of the backseat SLITHERING and SNAKING
heir way around Stormie and Erwin One of Jasons
oots wiggles under the seat making its way towards
he gas peddle The other boot is content to lay

nder the back window and kick Erwin in the head

ecedtodtcmuod

As Meagan fights to pull Jasons hand of Jesses face
she looks down and sees Jasons other hand between
her legs Meagan screams

Jasons boot stomps on the gas and Jesses car lurches
forward with the acceleration The nightmaremobile
SLAMS into the side of Jesses car again causing it
to swerve violently from side to side

Inside the nightmaremobile Freddy pulls another lever

CLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
up and a circular sawblade arm extends out CUTTING
into Jesses car with a flurry of SPARKS Inside
Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg
CUTTING forward towards

CLOSE ON JESSES FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
it The tire BLOWS and Jesses car lurches off the
road veering into a tree line

CRASH -- Jesses car plows fender-first into a tree
the HORN stuck on BLARING

Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
overdrive ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant

In the distance -- an old farmhouse The lights go
on inside

The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
ground bleeding from a slight scalp wound A rear
door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out locked in
embrace and not seriously hurt Meagan staggers
around to the drivers side and opens the door Jesse
is laying unconscious against the steering wheel
Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops
Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess

MEAGAN
(continuing)
Jesses hurt real bad weve got
to get him to a doctor

Through the farmhouse window Erwin and Stormie see
the farmer on the phone

ERWIN
Dont worry an ambulance is on
the way

Meagan cradles Jesses head in her hands crying

MEAGAN
Oh God Jesse

Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it Inside -- the
garbage bags with Jasons remains still inside --
untouched Erwin goes to Meagan and says

ERWIN
Meagan listen to me The cops
are on their way If they find me
and Jason Voorhees in the trunk
there were finished

MEAGAN
Go get out of here Take Jason

and Stormie with you

STORMIE
Im staying with you

Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says

ERWIN
Ill call you at the hospital

STORMIE

ERWIN
Somehow

Erwin takes off disappearing with Jasons remains
into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --
growing close

INT HOSPITAL - JESSES ROOM - NIGHT

Jesse is laying in a hospital bed his leg ina
special tent Meagan and Stormie watch from the
doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesses vitals As he
finishes Meagan asks

MEAGAN
Is he going to be okay

DOCTOR
Yes But he needs a lot of rest
His leg is broken in four places
and he has four broken ribs and a
concussion

Meagan sits down next to Jesse taking his hand
Stormie turns to the doctor

STORMIE

Stormie dashes for the staircase

INT HOSPITAL - JESSES ROOM - SAME TIME

Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep Jesses heart
monitor BEEPS
On the wall an x-ray viewer flickers to life Freddy
peeks out from behind the other side He snickers and
ducks back down

Suddenly Freddys hand reaches up from inside the bed
and grabs Jesse pulling him down into the mattress

Meagan wakes and sees this screaming as Jesse grabs
onto the curtain

CLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of
the rings

Jesse disappears into the bed his screams echoing
away

Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing She rises up
again watching as Jesses iv and electrode wires
are pulled down after him Meagan grabs a handful
of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back But
the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the
mattress

INT OLD WEST SALOON (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol saloon As
she gets to her feet she sees Jesses iv tubes running
along the floor and out the door Meagan follows

them to the saloon door where she stops and looks

out into

Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse dressed
in a cowboy sheriffs outfit complete with hat badge

fear staring at something coming down the street

Its Freddy Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit

FREDDY

Trembling with fear Jesse fumbles for his pistol

He pulls it out and FIRES Freddy laughs Jesse

and laughs From the saloon Meagan screams

MEAGAN

Freddy looks over at her annoyed

FREDDY

The SOUND of Jesses heart monitor BEEPING erratically
wakes Meagan with a start She tries to wake Jesse

MEAGAN

Jesse keeps FIRING at Freddy until his gun CLICKS
empty Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn
gun you ever saw and says

FREDDY

Freddy FIRES

HARD CUT TO

Jesses stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
Meagan Jesses heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
flat line Jesse is dead
A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm She sees

Meagan standing over Jesses body covered in blood
and screams
Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
gasps

MEAGAN
Freddy killed Jesse

Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan pulling her out
of the room

INT HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall
the screams of the nurse fading into the distance

STORMIE
Jesus get a grip lady Youd
think a nurse in a hospital would
have seen a dead body before

MEAGAN
Jesse

Just then Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting
off the elevator They hear the nurses screams and
come running towards Jesses room Stormie pulls
Meagan behind the nurses station just as Murdoch
and company go thundering past

Then a VOICE on the PA says

VOICE
(filtered)
Attention Would Meagan or Stormie
please pick up the white paging
phone for a message

Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks The
announcement repeats itself again Then again
Stormie cant stand it anymore -- she stands up
and picks up the white paging phone

STORMIE
(into phone)
This is Stormie

Murdoch and his men come running past the nurses
station again Stormie turns her back to them but
Murdoch goes back to the nurses station asking

MURDOCH
Did you see a couple of girls go
by here a moment ago
Stormie gestures to the elevators

STORMIE

Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his
men right behind Stormie exhales a giant sigh of
relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says

HOSPITAL OPERATOR
(filtered)
The message is from Erwin he
says to meet him at the side
entrance in two minutes

Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan running for the
staircase

EXT HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as
Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck
He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan
inside climbing in after her and asking

STORMIE
Whered you get the truck

ERWIN
Same place Ive got Jason hid

STORMIE
And wheres that

ERWIN
A place where no one ever goes

Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
out of the parking lot

CuT TO
EXT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

The pick-up trucks headlights skew across a weather-
worn sign peppered with bullet holes CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp
past the cabins down towards the lake He stops a
short distance away from the pier and the three of
them climb out

Meagan is still in shock letting Stormie guide her
as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
platform tied up to the end

STORMIE
Whatd you do -- take him for a
swim

ERWIN
Almost

Erwin jumps down on the diving platform In the center
a large form is covered by a tarp Erwin helps Stormie
down onto the platform leaving Meagan standing on the
pier She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant
Erwin moves close to Stormie and gesturing to Meagan
asks

ERWIN
(continuing)
Is she going to be alright

STORMIE
I dont know Shes pretty fucked
up God I dont know why Im not

ERWIN
Youre a strong woman

STORMIE
Whats that supposed to mean

ERWIN
Uhhh nothing I didnt mean
anything

Stormie gestures to the tarp

STORMIE
Is this him

ERWIN
Yeah
(whips back tarp)
Meet the new and improved Jason

ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
platform cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
coiled leads trailing off into the water Erwin has
done a good job of sewing Jason back together with
barbed wire and fishing line His arms and legs have
been reinforced with steel braces and even Jasons
mask has been repaired stitched down the middle with
bailing wire Jason looks nineties and butch

STORMIE
Whyd you put that stupid mask
on him

ERWIN
Take a look

Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
and quickly replaces it

STORMIE
Good idea
ERWIN
Not exactly a beauty queen entry
is he
STORMIE
So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy

Osbourne song backwards or something

ERWIN
Im afraid its not that simple

STORMIE
I thought you said you knew how to
bring him back to life

ERWIN
I do But when I was putting him
back together I noticed something
was missing

Stormie thinks about this for a second then

STORMIE
Awwww he wont be needing that
I mean what girl would let him
put his rotten ol

ERWIN
(cuts her off)
No-no Not that Its his heart
its missing

STORMIE
Well does it really matter
Cant you use an aquarium pump or
something

ERWIN
No he has to have a heart A
human heart A good one

Meagan speaks for the first time

MEAGAN
I know where we can get a heart
A good one

EXT MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

A sign reads CITY MORGUE Through the front window
a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk
Erwin Stormie and Meagan watch him from the pick-up
parked a safe distance away

ERWIN
That guard in there might pose a
problem

MEAGAN

Do you think you and Stormie could
keep him occupied for a few minutes

Erwin and Stormie exchange looks then shrug -- why
not
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Okay lets do it

A few moments later the guard looks up as the pick-
up swerves wildly into the parking lot He gets up
and goes to the glass door peering out

ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
making out -- hot and heavy

INT MORGUE - NIGHT

Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling She
crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
to the floor She shines her flashlight around the
dark laboratory illuminating anatomy charts jars
full of organs etc

Crossing to the lockers Meagan tentatively opens
one of the drawers and shines her light inside --
ug Wrong guy She opens the next drawer -- ick
Even worse

Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse Her lip starts
to quiver as she caresses his face

EXT MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

At the glass door the guard is watching the action
in the parking lot his breath fogging the window
He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
better look

Inside the truck Stormie and Erwin wrestle around

STORMIE
Hey Watch that

ERWIN
Im just trying to make it look real

STORMIE
Just keep your hands above the bra
pizza face

The windows are starting to steam up

INT MORGUE - SAME TIME

Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
gloves Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
ments (saws rib cutters etc) and selects a large
knife

Meagan stands over Jesses body She pulls back the
sheet exposing his chest Meagan raises the knife

far above her head

MEAGAN
Forgive me Jesse

Meagan plunges the knife into Jesses chest with a
sickening THWACK

EXT MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME
The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged
obscuring the guards view He licks his lips
deciding to investigate closer The guard unlocks
the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin
They spot him coming and break their embrace In
another moment the pick-up is PEELING out of the
parking lot The guard watches the truck go shakes
his head and goes back inside to start his rounds

Up the street parked with the lights off in the night
shade of a large tree Stormie and Erwin watch as the
guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
the morgue

STORMIE
Hes head right for her Do some-
thing

Erwin panics for a moment then HONKS the HORN

INT MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT

Meagan is trying to pull Jesses heart out of his
chest but it just wont come some vein or muscle
fiber keeps pulling it back She jumps at the HORN
then starts pulling harder

In the hallway just outside the guard hears the HORN
and stops He starts back for the front when suddenly
the HORN stops

Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
to Jesses heart As the last strand goes Meagan
tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD

The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue
drawing his gun He tip-toes to the door and carefully
unlocks it leaving his keys in the lock Taking a
two-handed Weaver stance the guard raises his foot

and kicks the door

WHACK -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
inside like Marshall Dillon snapping on the lights
He gasps eyes going wide as he scans the room One
of the drawers is open the stiffs chest has got
a huge hole in it blood spattered everywhere

a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
cabinet

Suddenly the guard sees Meagan half out the window
and cries

GUARD
Stop right there

Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES
The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS The guard
curses and races for the

EXT MORGUE - SECONDS LATER

The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away He
shrinks dejected -- no way to catch them now The
guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
that the door has closed and locked behind him

The ol coot shines his light down into Jasons empty
grave

CRAZY OL COOT

Damn kids I just knew they were
comin up here to do somethin
stupid

The SWAT commander comes up to Murdoch
SWAT COMMANDER
Just got a call on the radio --
three juveniles just broke into the

morgue -- one male two female The

the Freddy cult -- burnt face

CRAZY OL COOT
Sounds like the same kids I saw

MURDOCH

SWAT COMMANDER

CuT TO
EXT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

Meagan sits on the end of the pier watching silently
as Erwin sews Jesses heart into Jasons chest using
dental floss Stormie comes up behind her and puts
her jacket around Meagans shoulders sits down beside
her and says

STORMIE
Youve got to quit blaming your-
self for what happened to Jesse
it wasnt your fault

MEAGAN
He didnt want to come with us
but he did anyway He did it for me

STORMIE
Im not sorry I came I dont
think Jesse would be either

MEAGAN
I just cant believe hes dead I
keep thinking hell show up any
minute

ERWIN
Well that just about does it

Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
the pier cutting the diving platform free He kicks
it off and it floats out into the lake drifting free
Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore leading
them over to where a short trench has been dug leading
from the waters edge

In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
cable
ERWIN
(continuing)

As you can see Ive excavated the
power cable that runs across the
bottom of Crystal Lake Ive cut
away the insulation exposing a
patch of cable right near the waters
edge

Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
at the head of the trench

ERWIN
(continuing)
Now when I kick this over the water
will wash down the trench and bridge
an eletrical gap between the cable
and the lake Theres plenty of
voltage so it should work

STORMIE
So you kick the bucket and Jason
lives

ERWIN

Yeah right
(then)
Okay keep your fingers crossed

Erwin kicks the bucket over The water washes down
the trench over the cable and -- POW Z-Z-Z-ZAP

A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES Then the lake begins to
glow and the water begins to churn Erwin and the
girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake
engulfing the diving platform
The ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
onto Jasons body his massive frame convulsing

CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
spirals down into the eye hole like water running
down a drain

CLOSE ON JASONS EYE as it opens We dive into the
eye and take a fantastic dreamtime travel to

CLOSE ON MASK (1950s version of a hockey mask)
reflected in the water A young hand reaches up and
pulls off the mask revealing the disfigured boy
beneath This is JASON -- AGE 9

JASONS FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
down cabin in dirty longjohns holding a bottle of
rye He bellows

JASONS FATHER
Jason Git your ass over here

Jason jumps at his fathers voice hesitates only
slightly then runs toward him stopping abruptly
several paces away

JASONS FATHER
(continuing)
What did I teach you boy Dont
ever take your mask off out in
public I dont want nobody to see
that ugly mug of yours

Jason stands looking at his bare feet His father
smacks him upside the head shoving him towards the
woodshed

JASONS FATHER
(continuing)
Go git in the woodshed

Jasons pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he
knows whats coming next

JASONS FATHER
(continuing)
Drop them overalls and lay over
them logs
Jason

slowly complies as his father loosens his belt

Suddenly JASONS MOTHER is just outside the doorway
calling

Jason

JASONS MOTHER

gives his father a sideways glance then scurries

towards his mother

Jason

JASONS FATHER

Jasons mother charges at her husband shoving him
back into the shed with the knife Jason looks back
Through the open window he sees his mothers arm
coming down repeatedly with the knife his fathers
arms flailing helplessly Then both disappear from
view After a moment his mother appears in the door-
way spattered with blood She smiles and waves to
him calling

JASONS MOTHER

(continuing)
Go on son have a good time
Mommy will come and git you some
day soon

Jason turns and runs to

EXT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

Wearing his mask Jason walks through the entrance
to the camp with his jar of money

In the office the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money
and shakes his hand

HEAD COUNSELOR
Welcome aboard son Im sure
youll have a great time

CUT TO

The other KIDS dance around Jason taunting him
laughing at him pointing and teasing Jason
breaks away running towards the pier

Jason sits at the end of the pier looking at his own
reflection He removes the mask and watches as the
distortions in the water make his face look normal

Someone comes up behind Jason slowly Jason isnt
aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
appears behind his own Jason turns to see who when
he is suddenly pushed into the lake

Jason splashes to the surface sputtering trying to
stay afloat A hand pushes his head back under the
water

JASONS UNDERWATER POV -- a distorted image of
whoever is holding him under
Jason thrusts out his arms fighting to get back to
the surface fighting just to see who is killing
him before he dies

HARD CUT TO
EXT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

Jason comes alive thrashing around on the diving dock
the electricity all over him like a spider web On
shore Erwin and the girls gasp

ERWIN
Holy shit It worked

Meagan and Stormie bounce excitedly But something
is wrong Jason thrashes around on the dock unable
to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire

MEAGAN
Its kill him Shut it off Shut
it off

ERWIN
Shut it off it suddenly occurs

to me that I hadnt really planned
for that contingency

STORMIE
Just dont stand there Do something

But all Erwin can do is scratch his head Meagan
rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake

MEAGAN
Jason JASON Youve got to get up
Do you hear me Get up

Jason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
against the diving dock SMASHING it to bits Water
rushes over him and -- ZZ2ZZT KA-POWw

A power transformer on shore EXPLODES causing Meagan
and her friends to cringe When they look back the
electrical light show fades away leaving nothing but
smoke and floating debris Meagan and Stormie turn to
Erwin who shrugs shyly and says

ERWIN
Well its off now
Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
shrink any man to pus much less Erwin He cowers
between them offering quick excuses and humble
apologies

All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
never notice Jasons shadowy figure as it rises from
the lake

Then they do see him scream and run Jason charges
after the kids in his familiar unstoppable killer
gait

Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
dash past He closes the door behind him and squirms
out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
and steps inside Erwin races around to the front

and closes the door He fastens the latch and padlock
then calls to the girls

ERWIN
(continuing)
Hey Come back Ive got him locked
up in the tool shed

Just then the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
through the tool shed door Erwin screams like a
girl and runs away

INT MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Meagan and Stormie run into the main room Stormie
spots a phone and goes to it dialing frantically

MEAGAN
Who are you calling

STORMIE
The cops Who else

MEAGAN
Are you kidding Theyll lock us
up and throw away the key

STORMIE
Fine by me
(clicks the receiver)
Damnit Its dead

Just then Erwin bursts into the cabin slamming
the door shut behind him
ERWIN
Hes right behind me

Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough
Jason is storming towards them holding the chainsaw

STORMIE
(to Erwin)
Youre the one who brought him
back to life

ERWIN
And

STORMIE
Well do something

Erwin screams and runs for the closet hiding inside
Stormie clucks

STORMIE
(continuing)
Oh some hero

Just then the chainsaw RIPS through the front door
Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
closet closing themselves inside

They cower in the closet listening for a long
moment nothing but the sound of their heavy
breathing

Then with the RIPPING of WOOD Jason chainsaws the
closet door -- knocking it to the floor Erwin draws
out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger

Jason charges forward when Meagan suddenly stands
up in front of him and yells

MEAGAN
STOP
To everyones shock Jason does
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Now just stop Were the ones

that brought you back to life

And you have no right to kill us
with that chainsaw In fact you
owe us
STORMIE
Thats right She gave you her
boyfriends heart you know

MEAGAN
Thats right

Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup

MEAGAN
(continuing)
Look Heres his picture

Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
opens the locket She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
inside Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
in his humongous hands gently touching the photo of
Jesse with a meaty finger

MEAGAN
(continuing)
Now I know that youve been through
a lot And I know that youre pissed
off about being murdered and all

STORMIE
(interjects)
I know I would be

MEAGAN
But if you help us kill Freddy
Krueger I promise to help you

find the little bastard that
killed you What do you say Have
we got a deal

Meagan sticks out her hand to shake Jason stares at
it looks back at the locket then to Meagan Finally
he reaches out his huge hand for Meagans when

Brilliant blinding white light blazes through the
windows freezing everyone to the spot Anxious to
get out of the closet with Jason Erwin crawls across
the floor and peeks out over the window sill

ANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
lights towards the cabin two dozen COPS aim their
weapons In the middle of this impressive show of
force is Murdoch He raises a bullhorn to his lips

MURDOCH
(through bullhorn)
You in there This is Captain Renton
Murdoch -- State Trooper I am
ordering you to come out with your
hands up Ill give you until the
count of three

(beat)
Three

Meagan turns to Jason shoving him back into the
closet

MEAGAN
(whispering)
Jason you have to hide Stay in
here and dont come out until we
tell you Stormie help me

Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet
closing the door Then they quickly smooth down
their hair and clothes moving towards the door

EXT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

Meagan Stormie and Erwin come out with their hands
raised high above their heads As they walk towards
the police cars several of the SWAT team moves
in and arrests them As they are handcuffed and
searched Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again

MURDOCH
(through bullhorn)
Alright anybody else left in
there had better say their prayers

ERWIN
Theres no one else inside

MURDOCH
Is that a fact
(into bullhorn)
Okay you had your chance

Suddenly one of the cops points towards the cabin
and shouts

COP
Hey look

All heads turn towards the cabin where Jasons
massive frame is filling the doorway
SWAT COMMANDER
Holy Mary mother of God would
you look at the size of that guy

MURDOCH
(almost happy)
I knew it

All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch
suddenly steps forward gesturing for everyone to get
behind him

MURDOCH
(continuing)

Stand back Ill handle this

Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers

MURDOCH
(continuing)
You
Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too

Murdoch goes for his gun but instead of bringing out
a pistol he holds a laser designator Murdoch fires

A big red dot appears on Jasons chest Jason looks
down at it like it was a harmless bug He looks back
up at Murdoch who raises a radio to his lips and says

MURDOCH
(continuing

into radio)
Let her go

EXT 60000 FEET ABOVE CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND
A military jet flying above drops its payload -- a
laser-guided napalm bomb

EXT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME TIME

A slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp
Crystal Lake Jason looks up

SMART BOMB POV as it drops down on Jason -- homing
in on the laser dot on his chest

BA-BOOM -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames
All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them
Only Murdoch stands his ground his arms outstretched
as he embraces the terrible sight

MURDOCH
Thatll teach you to fuck with the

law Voorhees

A cop behind him says

COP
Uhh sir your hats on fire
Murdoch looks up -- sure enough his Smokey Bear hat

is burning above the brim

Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in
flames her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone Then
a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie
Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange
worrisome looks through the windows just before the
cars pull away

As the cops start to pull out one of them notices
something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING
form walking towards the lake As it stumbles out
onto the pier the cop turns to his partner and says

CURIOUS COP
Hey do you see that

But just then the form falls through the BURNING
pier SPLASHING into the water below The partner

looks sees nothing and shrugs

PARTNER
See what

CURIOUS COP
I thought I saw something

He shrugs it off and exits after his partner
Murdoch his hat still smoking a little surveys the
sight one last time before climbing into his patrol
car and driving away

CUT TO

INT POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

A cell door SLAMS in front of Stormies face A cell
door SLAMS in front of Meagans face Both girls are
behind bars separated by a cement wall The hefty
female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to
her desk

Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother
watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and
begins to devour three combo-burritos

MEAGAN
Weve got to try and stay awake

STORMIE
Getting something to eat might help
(calls to Deputy)
Yo Butch

DEPUTY MILLER

STORMIE

STORMIE

DEPUTY MILLER

STORMIE
(low to Meagan)
Cow I hope she chokes on her three
combo-burrito cud

Meagan leans up against the wall sliding down to
the floor in defeat

MEAGAN
What am I going to do Ill never
be able to find Lizzy now

STORMIE
You should be worrying about your-
self I know I am

Stormie plops down on her cot

INT CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
that she doesnt notice the strange shadow that
passes behind her

The shadow moves down the cellblock accompanied by

a slight SCRAPING Freddys glove materializes
raking the knives along the metal cross bars Freddy
stops at Stormies cell looking inside

Stormie is fast asleep

Freddy walks into Stormies cell passing right through
the bars Suddenly Stormie wakes and seeing Freddy
jumps to her feet and screams

STORMIE
Help Help Freddys here Hes here

But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesnt
respond finishing off the rest of the burrito and
licking her meaty fingers clean Freddy puts his
forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie
pointing to her cot Stormie looks over and sees her-
self asleep

STORMIE
(continuing)

Oh shit Im still asleep

She looks up at Freddy who smiles and says

FREDDY

Freddy flashes the glove of knives

INT POLICE STATION - NEXT MOMENT

MEAGANS MOM

INT CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell
by slicing off his fingers squirting green slime
Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool

STORMIE
You dont scare me Freddy Thanks
to my various phases and many hours
of watching violent televison I
have become immune to violence Seen
it all and done it all Nothing you
do can gross me out -- so why dont
you give it your best shot bitch

FREDDY
Then maybe Ill just CUT to the chase

Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks keeping her
defensive stance

STORMIE
Im warning you Freddy my father
is a drill sergeant in the Marine
Corps and he taught me just how to
defend myself against slimy bastards
like you

FREDDY

Oh Im so scared honey Come on
Hit me Punch me right in the nose

Freddy juts out his chin gesturing for Stormie to
take a punch Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy
right in the nose

FREDDY
(continuing
surprised)
Owwwww

Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her
fist is stuck in Freddys nose Freddy takes ina
breath and Stormies arm is sucked up past the elbow
She screams

Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right
up his nose her screams turning into a faint BUZZ
Freddy smiles

FREDDY
(continuing)
Now thats what I call getting a
buzz

INT FREDDYS NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND

Now the size of a flea Stormie is clinging to one
of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
the circular walls -- Freddys nose hairs Stuck in
those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
boogers

Sitting next to Stormie a particularly large and
rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
distorted voice of Harry Manfredini)

BOOGERMAN
Hi there Im the Boogerman Heh-
heh get it

Stormie screams backing up into the trees trying
to put distance between herself and Boogerman

BOOGERMAN
(continuing)
Aww dont go we can play Star
Wars You can be Princess Leia and
Ill be Jabba the Hutt

Boogerman licks his fat nasty lips with a slimy green
tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba Stormie
screams again
INT POLICE STATION - SAME TIME
Meagan is getting more and more agitated

MEAGAN
Were wasting time Weve got to
close down all the churches --
Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy
ground

Meagans parents stare at their daughter with confused
frightened looks

MEAGAN
(continuing)
Dont you understand He has to
come to our reality to do it Its
our last chance to kill him

MURDOCH
Okay I think weve heard enough of
this crap Take her back to the
lockup

A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan She throws them off
and they grab her again roughly Meagans parents
watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their
daughter back to her cell kicking and screaming

MEAGAN
Dad Mom Dont let them lock me up
I have to save Lizzy

MEAGANS MOM
Oh Meagan youre sick You dont
even realize what youve done

MEAGAN
I did what I had to do to try and
save Lizzy

MURDOCH
Yeah including murdering your boy-
friend and cutting his heart out

MEAGAN
Liar Freddy killed Jesse He was
already dead when I cut his heart
out

Meagans mom and dad gasp recoiling with horror
MEAGAN
(continuing manic)
Goddamnit you dont understand

Freddy lives FREDDY LIVES

Meagans raving grows faint as she disappears into
the cellblock Murdoch pulls Meagans dad aside

MURDOCH
I know how you must feel I had
a dog once I loved that dog I
treated her like my own daughter
We went camping picnics in the
park I even had a little stocking
for her nailed up on the mantle for
Christmas Then one day she bit
me so I had to blow her brains
out

(sighs)

God I loved that dog

INT STORMIES CELL and NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME

Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger
knife

A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril
cavern sending Stormie into hysterics

BOOGERMAN
Uh-oh Freddys picking his nose
again -- gotta go

Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the
nostril cavern Stormie watches the massive knife
blade as it comes right for her then at the last
possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman
She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo racing
ahead

BOOGERMAN
(continuing)
Well excuse me

INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into
his head

The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back running
him through and spilling his Boogerman guts out his
front Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is
pulled out kicking and screaming

Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose peering
closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end He
twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-
man across the cell

Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space smack-
ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT Boogerman
flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo
his nasty head still alive in the center

Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell his arm
extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to
the deputys desk He feels around on the table until
he touches the pepper shaker drawing it back into
Stormies cell

Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
clings to life deep inside the nostril

Freddys face begins to distort his nose wrinkling

up -- the beginnings of a sneeze
FREDDY
Ahhh ahhh ahhh--CHoo

Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddys nose
with globules of snot She flies across the massive
cell headed directly for the splattered Boogerman
screaming her head off

Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he
screams too

HARD CUT TO
INT POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NEXT INSTANT

As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
hear a loud SPLAT

MEAGAN
Stormie

The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
cautiously glancing around the wall into Stormies
cell then promptly puking combo burrito Meagan
runs up and looks The wall to Stormies cell is
splattered with blood and bits
Meagan falls to her knees sobbing as more DEPUTIES
come running into the cellblock answering the
deputys puke-choked scream

MEAGAN
(continuing)
Oh God what have I done What
have I done

We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to

EXT LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

An ambulance races along the road with its emergency
lights flashing In back Erwin lays strapped to a
gurney Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT They
chat disparagingly about the freak in the back when
suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead
The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
with a terrible SQUEAL

WHUMP -- the ambulance plows into the form knocking
it some fifty feet down the road The driver and the
attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock
Finally the driver turns to the attendant and says

AMBULANCE DRIVER
Ill go check it out You stay here

The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
road He bends down to examine the charred mammoth
carcass when a fist flies up smacking the driver in
the face He falls to the ground unconscious

The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
its Jason Burnt and blackened but ready for action
He starts towards the ambulance

The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver
emptying into Jasons chest Jason recoils only
slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls then he
grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
pistol in panic Jason slams the attendants face
into the side of the ambulance

In the back of the ambulance a terror-stricken Erwin
watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH Then
silence
RIP -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
and climbs inside the shocks bottoming out under his
weight He reaches out for Erwin who closes his
eyes waiting for the inevitable

Then nothing

After a second Erwin opens an eye Jason is standing
over him hand outstretched In his big burnt palm
-- Meagans necklace Erwin looks from the necklace
to Jason Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently

ERWIN
You want me to tell you where
Meagan is

Again with the thrusting

ERWIN
(continuing)
Well why didnt you say so Jesus
for a minute there I thought you
were going to kill me
(then)
Youre not are you

Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time

ERWIN
(continuing)
Okay okay Ill take you right
to her Could you help me out of
this

Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps

Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close
behind Erwin climbs in behind the wheel saying

ERWIN
(continuing)
Ill drive

Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
the passenger side door

ERWIN
(continuing)
Okay you drive

As Jason climbs into the drivers seat a CHIME goes
off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says
COMPUTER VOICE
Fasten your safety belt please

Erwin fastens his Jason watches him and pulls the
safety belt across his massive chest -- it wont reach
Jason pulls harder ripping the belt out of the bolts
The CHIME goes crazy

COMPUTER VOICE
(continuing)
Fasten your safety belt please
Fasten your safety belt please

Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist silencing
the voice and chime He turns suddenly to Erwin as if
to say Yeah What about it Erwin shrugs nervously

ERWIN
Fuck the bitch Lets roll

With tires SQUEALING burning rubber and smoke the
ambulance roars away into the early morning

DISSOLVE TO

falls over turning upside down It hangs there for

an instant then -- POW -- the cross EXPLODES catching
the curtains on FIRE

As the FLAMES consume the curtains a hole in reality
appears -- a Dreamgate Freddy comes springing out
leaping in front of the podium He laughs and turns
to Lizzy asleep on the bench

around Meagans neck as she struggles to remain calm

EXT RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT

Outside the cultists surrounding the outside of the
station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to
the fence Murdoch and the SWAT commander get
out of the lead car Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
and says

MURDOCH
(through bullhorn)
This is Captain Renton Murdoch --
State Trooper Im giving you until
the count of three to come out with
your hands up

A CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch the bullet
hit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car The
other cops duck down but not Murdoch he turns
calmly to the SWAT commander and says

MURDOCH
(continuing)
Hand me that flare pistol

The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch adding

SWAT COMMANDER
Good idea Throw a little light on
them -- see if we can spot their
firing positions

As the commander speaks Murdoch aims the pistol
carefully and FIRES PHOOMPH -- the flare streaks
to the roof of the TV station SMACKING the sniper
He BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground
screaming Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
commander going back on the bullhorn and saying

MURDOCH
(through bullhorn)
Alright now Im through playing
nice guy -- I want the rest of
you punks to come out right now
with your hands up

The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
-- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars SMASHING glass
and PIERCING metal The cops FIRE back BULLET HITS
EXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station

INT STUDIO - NEXT MOMENT

The cultists bare Meagans arm and inject her with
dream dope She takes her place at the threshold
beside Freddy

EXT RELIGIOUS TV STATION - SAME TIME

As the battle outside between the cultists and the
cops RAGES Murdoch and the SWAT commander squat
down behind a fender to reload

SWAT COMMANDER
Well it doesnt look like theyre
going to surrender

MURDOCH
What were going to need then is
somebody to charge their lines --
make a hole for us to slip in

SWAT COMMANDER
Where are you going to find anyone
that crazy

Just then an ambulance comes ROARING through the
police lines causing the cops to scurry like mice

MURDOCH
Here comes one now
(yells)
GO GIT EM SON

Murdoch squints to see whos driving its Jason
Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
side window as the ambulance zooms past

Murdoch curses drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
the ambulance

The other COPS join in a moment later BULLET HITS
SPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
through the front gate

Inside the ambulance Erwin hazards a glance back at
the cops then he turns to Jason and says

ERWIN
That was easy enough

Erwin looks ahead and screams

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
directly in front of the speeding ambulance FIRING
machine guns The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
ducks down

Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
ambulance into the middle one just before plowing
into the side of the station with a CRASH

Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
cultist closing in with a gun He reaches through the
smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultists
machine gun laying on the hood Erwin turns SHOOTS
the cultist just in time

As Jason kicks open the drivers side door he is
greeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him Jason RIPS
OFF the drivers side door and hurls it at the two
punks knocking them down like bowling pins Then
Jason reaches back into the ambulance pulls out the
Jaws of Life and with Erwin covering his back starts
towards the front door

INT STUDIO - SAME TIME
The wedding proceeds

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Once again if there be anyone
among you who does not want these
two people to be joined let him
speak now or forever hold his peace
Meagan looks around no one says anything The
reverend clears his throat to continue when

WHAM -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life

FREDDY
Uh oh

The cultists attack Jason Jason grabs the first
one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
a rag doll Another attacks with a machete bad
idea One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
machete Jason finishes off the last two cultists
as Erwin barricades the studio door The cultists
on the other side start POUNDING

Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete
slicing through a camera cable CLOSE ON CABLE as
it falls to the floor

Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate closing it
behind him

Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy He tries to
wake them but cant As Jason lumbers over Erwin
looks up and says

ERWIN
I cant wake them up Freddys
got them trapped

Erwin thinks for a moment then rushes over to a
couple of dead cultists He takes their syringes
Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
of dream dope

ERWIN
(continuing)
Go get him boy

Jason staggers forward falling into

INT NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

blow when -- CH-CHING -- knife blades jut out of the
glove He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
RIPPING him open rotten guts spilling out

Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
axe in her head This is BLOODY MARY Jason reaches
over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
her head Bloody Mary whips around yelling

BLOODY MARY

Jason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK -- Jason SLICES
OFF Freddys arm The crowd ROARS Freddy looks

FREDDY

Freddy GROWS a new arm complete with glove of knives

CHEERS

Jason chases Freddy around the ring looking for an
opening Freddy backpeddles tripping over the refs
decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
of the ring RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it

Up in their cage Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
disgust

Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy hoisting him
high above his head Then Jason body slams Freddy
to the mat The crowd CHEERS

Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddys back
Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
can of spinach In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
and gulps it down Suddenly Freddy throws Jason off
his back and stands huge muscles ballooning on his
chest and arms At the end of his right hand -- a
heavy metal boxing glove

Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
massive glove for a blow
CHING -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
glove Freddy swings knocking Jason into the ropes

He bounces off and falls to the mat The fans go nuts

As Jason tries to get up Freddy swings his right arm

around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
into a giant mallet Jason looks up just in time to
see the mallet coming down WHAM -- Freddy drives

Jason into the mat The crowd goes wild
From up in her cage Meagan starts to scream

MEAGAN
Jason Get up Get up

ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- its a dark foreboding (under-
water) abyss Jasons legs kick trying to get back
up Something slithers up from out of the deep
wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jasons boots
Freddy pushes down on Jasons mask shoving him down
Jason struggles but keeps slipping This looks like
the end of Jason Freddy laughs
MEAGAN
(continuing)

Jason Youve got to get up

JASONS POV of Freddy looking down at him pushing
him down drowning him

FLASH CUT TO
EXT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

YOUNG JASON POV as he is being drowned He fights
to get to the surface to see who it is

Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and
his killer comes into sharp focus

Its FREDDY (AGE 13) His Camp Crystal Lake nametag
reads Hi My name is Freddy He pushes the young
Jason down again laughing

HARD CUT TO
INT NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT INSTANT

Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
mat laughing when Jason snaps With a burst
of strength he kicks upward coming up out of the
mat Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
him up with him

Jasons momentum carries both of them up to the
ceiling where they CRASH through to

INT STUDIO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Jason wakes up holding Freddy by the throat as

he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above
the studio A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in

pain then realizes hes been brought into the

real world

FREDDY
Oh shit

Jason throws Freddy to the ground then raises up a
boot and stomps Freddys head SQUASHING it like a
tomato The Dream Demons squirt out

Just then the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door
They raise their weapons to fire when their heads
suddenly IMPLODE They fall screaming to the floor
-- dead

EXT RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT - SAME INSTANT

The remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the
police suddenly grab their heads screaming Their
heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground Murdoch
sees this and says to the SWAT commander

MURDOCH
Nows my chance give me sixty
seconds to get in there then move

in
Before the commander can reply Murdoch is off and
running into the station
INT STUDIO - SAME TIME

Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance
and embrace Then Meagan looks up at Erwin

MEAGAN
What took you so long

Erwin gestures to Jason trying to keep his voice low
so as to not hurt the big guys feelings

ERWIN
What ever you do dont let this
guy drive

Meagan smiles at Jason

MEAGAN
I knew you would come

Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddys body is
fast decaying turning back into blackened bones
scraps of cloth and a rusting glove of knives

The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor
then swim into the open end of the camera cable and
disappear

In the control room Freddys face appears on every
monitor laughing

ERWIN
Oh no Freddys in the transmitter

Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races
from the control room via a long thick cable running
overhead

ERWIN
(continuing)
Hes going for the satellite dish
If he uplinks with a communications
satellite he can beam himself any-
where in the world Well never be
rid of him

Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots
past them going through the ceiling to the

EXT RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The satellite dish mounted on the roof It begins

to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting
ready to beam Freddy

INT STUDIO - SAME TIME
Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable pulling it
hard

EXT ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The roof gives way tilting the big dish just as it
BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky

EXT EARTHS UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT

The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite ricocheting
off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite
tumbling into deep space

The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun

Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up

and screams His face burns away leaving a screaming
skull That too burns away leaving the Dream Demons
One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun

ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES causing a
solar prominence

INT TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME

The ceiling collapses in on Jason burying him under
a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish A ton of
dust billows up

Just then Murdoch bursts in He sees Lizzy and
Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun Erwin sees
this and jumps in-between them yelling

ERWIN
No Wait

Murdoch FIRES The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
the room where he lands in a heap Meagan and Lizzy
run to his side

Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his
chest With fading strength Erwin pulls his pin
out and pricks himself Erwin smiles and dies

MEAGAN

Erwin Erwin
MURDOCH
Hes dead and so are you if you
dont put your hands up right now

Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch He knocks her to
the floor taking aim on her head with the shotgun
as he says

MURDOCH
(continuing)
Its time I taught you girls some
respect for the law

In a panic Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
cultist and FIRES it at Murdochs head

PTT-TWANG -- Murdochs hat goes flying off with a
SPARK HIT revealing his bald hideous head -- a

large open wound with a metal plate underneath He
turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face

MURDOCH
(continuing)
So you wanna be a punk

Murdoch raises the shotgun taking aim on Meagan

MURDOCH
(continuing)
Then die like a punk

Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jasons
hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him Jason
jams his hand down the back of Murdochs pants and
pulls up his briefs lifting him a foot off the floor
with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble We
see Murdochs name written into his shorts

As Murdoch screams Jason jerks the shotgun from his
hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
of his pants Murdochs cheeks bulge out as the
muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth Jason cocks
the shotgun and

BOOM -- Murdochs head and shoulders EXPLODE from
his torso leaving his broken spine sticking up out
of shirt Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his
metal plate comes PINGING down rolling around and
spinning to a stop like a hubcap

Jason drops Murdoch (whats left of him) to the
floor just as the SWAT commander and his men
come charging in They see Jason and raise their
guns in panic

MEAGAN
No

Too late The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-
FIRE BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jasons chest Meagan
grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ
past

More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running They
start SHOOTING too Soon the doorway to the studio
is crowded with muzzle flash

More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason A bullet
hole outline appears on the wall behind him

The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
up More ammo More ammo

VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols
opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans
passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
cops in the studio

Jason keeps getting SHOT Pieces of his are flying
off Fingers shot off of a hand A knee shot away
to reveal the bone Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
of his chest and head

Finally the cops start to run out of ammo The
SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop leaving
the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
gunsmoke in the room

As it clears Jason still stands He teeters a little
then falls backwards with a mighty THUD

Jason lays dying Meagan rushes to his side Jason
reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and

pulls something out -- Jesses heart

Jason hands the heart to Meagan Then Jasons head
rolls back -- hes dead

Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio
revealing her surrounded by Jason Freddy and Murdoch

DISSOLVE TO

INT LIZZYS ROOM - NIGHT
Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed She gives her the
Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight As Meagan

-- nada

MEAGAN

Freddys nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
licks Meagan in the face She yelps and slams the
phone down

Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it She
climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
