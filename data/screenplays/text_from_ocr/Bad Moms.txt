BAD MOMS

June 9 2015
EXT NORCHESTER MASSACHUSETTS -- MORNING

Norchester is a beautiful leafy suburb of Boston Kids ride
bikes Dads walk dogs Neighbors chat with each other And in
the middle of town sits

THE NORCHESTER SCHOOL

Surrounded by playgrounds and lush fields Norchester is the
public school we all wish our kids could go to dynamic
teachers motivated students winning sports teams every
type of arts program imaginable -- it’s perfect

A LINE OF MINIVANS DISGORGE HUNDREDS OF K-12 CHILDREN

in front of the school as WELL-DRESSED MOMS load up their
precocious KIDS with backpacks lunchboxes and science
projects before kissing them goodbye Then

A TOTALLY BUSTED 1985 TOYOTA CELICA

thunders up to the school blasting HIP HOP and billowing GREY
SMOKE from its tailpipe The car rumbles to a stop and a HUGE
15 YEAR OLD with a mullet and ripped jeans get out--

VOICE FROM THE CAR
Hey dum-dum you forgot your lunch

A bag of McDONALD’S flies out of the car The giant kid
catches the bag and shambles off towards the school Finally
we reveal the MOM driving the Celica

CARLA DUNKLER

She’s wearing a low cut silver lamé top no bra sunglasses
and she couldn’t give a fuck FREEZE FRAME on Carla lighting
up a cigarette as we smash the title over her face

BAD MOMS

UNFREEZE as camera captures all of the other MOMS’ horrified
reactions to Carla They shake their heads disgusted

CARLA JUST FLIPS THEM ALL THE BIRD

as she roars off down the street The camera STAYS WITH the
beautiful super-fit super-rich alpha mom of the school

GWENDOLYN JAMES

as she watches Carla drive off She turns to her two best
friends VICKY LATROBE not so bright and MEAN STACY
GWENDOLYN
That woman is a fucking cancer

MEAN STACY
Why can’t you get them kicked out
of the school like you did with
the Mandel’s

GWENDOLYN
Because she’s one-sixteenth
Chickasaw Indian and you can’t
fuck with that kind of diversity
(scowling after Carla)
No that bitch is bulletproof

VICKY LATROBE
Couldn’t you find another Indian to
replace Carla

GWENDOLYN
Vicky I’m the President of the
PTA I’m not Kevin fucking Costner
okay I can’t just blow my ram’s
horn and make more Indians appear

Mean Stacy frowns at a CLUSTER OF MOMS nearby
MEAN STACY

Oh gross look all the Attachment
Moms are wearing harem pants today

The ATTACHMENT MOMS long hair BABIES in slings HIPPY KIDS
at their feet walk up the path wearing baggy harem pants

GWENDOLYN
Those bitches better vaccinate
their filthy children or I swear to
God I will go off--
(waving sweetly to them)
Hey Meg Hey Shar Love your pants

The ATTACHMENT MOMS wave back friendly heyyy
VICKY LATROBE

Uh-oh the Tiger Moms are late
today

Three anxious TIGER MOMS hurry their stressed CHILDREN up the
walk to the school wheeling suitcases full of books

MEAN STACY
Violin Camp must’ve run late this
morning
GWENDOLYN
Look at their fucking kids They
look like hostages
(smiling to Tiger Moms)
Hey Karen call me

ONE OF THE TIGER MOMS waves sweetly as she hurries past

MEAN STACY
Oh God pretend to look at your
phones here comes that weird stay-
at-home mom

A dorky stay-at-home mom KIKI approaches wearing a
cardigan mom jeans and a desperate smile She herds TWO
SMALL KIDS and a pair of BABY TWINS Gwendolyn’s crew quickly
looks at their phones trying not to make eye contact but
Kiki walks right up to them barely holding it together

KIKI
Hey guys how are you guys

GWENDOLYN
Oh hey Kiki how are y--

KIKI
I’m amazing Maddie was up all night
barfing on my hair but I’m great
I’m so happy--

GWENDOLYN
Awesome well have a good day

KIKI
Also Bernard has night terrors he’s
really not doing okay--

GWENDOLYN
Great I’ll see you at the bake sale-

KIKI
Hey I was going to get a fun coffee
after this it’s like the only thing
I do for myself every day do you
want to come with me

GWENDOLYN
Oh I’d really rather not but thank
you

Kiki nods painedhappy and shepherds all of her kids
towards the school Gwendolyn exhales watching Kiki
GWENDOLYN (CONT’D)
Jesus she’s like two days away from
driving her kids into a lake

Just then a MINIVAN squeals up and the hero of our story
AMY MITCHELL

scrambles out chic in a skirt suit Amy hurries her two
kids DYLAN 10 sweet lazy and JANE 16 anxious over-
achiever out of her minivan She smiles at a PASSING MOM

MEAN STACY
And here’s Amy late as always

GWENDOLYN
I love how hard she works

VICKY LATROBE
Oh my god such a hard worker

GWENDOLYN
I just fucking said that Vicky

ON AMY

as she ushers her kids up the path towards the school
handing them a comically large amount of stuff

AMY
Okay here are your lunches
organic turkey club for Jane and
gluten free peanut butter and jelly
with low salt yam chips for Dylan--

She hands TUPPERWARE PLATTERS OF DELICIOUS FOOD to each of
her kids They take them unimpressed and ungrateful

DYLAN
What are yam chips

AMY
I don’t know the school sent an
email saying that yams are more
sustainable than potatoes but to be
totally honest I don’t know what
sustainable means I just don’t want
to get in trouble with the crazy
food moms Oh and Dylan here’s
what I made for your American
History project--
She hands Dylan an AMAZING THREE FOOT PAPER-MACHE HEAD OF
RICHARD NIXON Dylan takes it again unimpressed by his mom’s
amazing handiwork as they near the school entrance

AMY (CONT’D)
Okay I love you guys so much

Amy kisses both of her kids emotional--

JANE
Not so loud mom Jesus
AMY
I LOVE YOU BOTH SO MUCH I LOVE MY

BABIES
Jane and Dylan race into school embarrassed as Amy grins

GWENDOLYN
Hey Amy

Amy looks over sees Gwendolyn and her crew and smiles

AMY
Oh hey How are you guys

GWENDOLYN
I don’t know how you do it leaving
your kids and going to work every
day You’re so strong

AMY
Oh thanks--

MEAN STACY
Don’t you just miss them

AMY
I do but I also need like money--

MEAN STACY
I had a job once but I didn’t love
it so I quit

VICKY LATROBE

MEAN STACY
Jesus Christ Vicky stop saying that
like it’s a good thing

AMY
Okay well I’m late for work so
MEAN STACY
Youre always late

AMY
I know it’s basically the only
thing I’m good at these days Bye
They say goodbye Gwendolyn watches Amy race off troubled

GWENDOLYN
She’s so likeable

The moms shudder equally disgusted

THE GREAT ROOM

to find her husband MIKE watching TV with their dog ROSCOE
drinking a beer feet up He sees Amy and doesn’t get up

MIKE

Amy crosses to the KITCHEN AREA and puts down her bags
exhausted as sounds of her kids’ VIOLENT CHASE filter in

AMY (CONTD)
So um did you notice that Dylan
and Jane are kind of like

MIKE
Oh no I’ve been watching Travel
Channel We should totally go to

MIKE
Me No I’m really not sure why you
thought that
He watches TV as something SHATTERS in the distance

AMY

decides for the millionth time that it just isn’t worth it

AMY
Nevermind
MIKE

filet of fish three vegetable sides bottle of crisp white
wine and a fresh-baked cake on a stand The family wolfs
down the meal in silence Mike types on his iPhone

They high-five as Mike keeps typing on his phone Amy just
looks at her husband frustrated Then she remembers

black swan on me right now okay

INT JANE’S ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

stressed Jane and Amy pace in front the laptop on Jane’s
bed biting their nails in exactly the same way

JANE
What time is it now

AMY
Still 859

JANE

Mother and daughter pace Then Amy looks at her watch

Jane lunges for the laptop and furiously types She scans the
screenand then freaks out

JANE

They hug and jump together

AMY
OH MY GOD I’M SO RELIEVED

They finally stop jumping and catch their breath Amy beams

AMY (CONT’D)

JANE

done this without you

Amy smiles touched These are the moments that make it all
worth it

JANE (CONTD)

boyfriend is going to knock me up

of the highway Oh my god I need to

Jane grabs a SOCCER BALL and hurries out hyper-stressed Amy
just stands there dumbstruck

AMY
Holy shit shes so crazy

INT MIKE’S HOME OFFICE -- LATER THAT NIGHT
Amy enters Mike’s home office yawning smiling

AMY
Good news Jane made the soccer--

Amy stops upon seeing Mike behind his DESKTOP COMPUTER
trying to zip his pants and use the mouse at the same time

AMY (CONT’D)
Oh my god are you--

MIKE
No It was justa prostate thing--
(struggling with mouse)
Why wont this window close

Amy makes her way around the desk chuckling

AMY
You know I’ve always wondered what
kind of porno you like--

Her smile vanishes when she sees that Mike is Skyping with a
NAKED WOMAN with giant boobs and an even bigger bush The
naked woman sees Amy enter frame and looks pissed

NAKED WOMAN ON COMPUTER
Who the hell are you

AMY
I’m his wife -- who are you
NAKED WOMAN ON COMPUTER
Oh shit--

The naked woman lunges out of frame Amy spins on Mike

AMY
Are you masturbating with another
woman on Skype

MIKE
No No

AMY
Then what are you doing

MIKE
(beat)
Okay yes obviously I’m masturbating
with another woman on Skype

AMY
Why are you doing that

MIKE
Look I don’t think I’ve done
anything wrong here This is very
mainstream now

Amy rubs her face trying to get her head around this

AMY
I don’t know Mike This really
feels like cheating

MIKE
No no no this is definitely not
cheating I’ve never even touched
her If anything this is a sign of
how much I respect our marriage

AMY
It is

MIKE
Yes This amazing free app allows
me to fulfill all of my darkest
desires so I don’t have to bring
you into that world Honestly I
don’t masturbate on Skype for me --
I masturbate on Skype for us

AMY
You gotta be shitting me

MIKE
A lot of women would be very happy
to find their husbands masturbating
on Skype three times a day instead
of cheating on them

AMY
You do this three times a day

MIKE
With my work schedule it’s almost
impossible but I try to make time
Honestly you should try it It’s
very invigorating Plus it’s
totally safe you can’t get herpes
or AIDS--

NAKED WOMAN ON COMPUTER
Fuck you Mike I don’t have AIDS

AMY
How long have you been doing this

MIKE
(looking at screen)
5 minutes and 22 seconds

AMY
No like how many days

MIKE
I don’t remember Not long--

NAKED WOMAN ON COMPUTER

MIKE
Seriously Sharron--

AMY
10 months DoDo you love her

The naked woman slowly rises up in the Skype window curious
to hear Mike’s answer Mike sweats tense looking between
the computer and his wife

MIKE
No I don’t love her

The naked woman on the monitor scowls So does Amy

AMY
Do you have feelings for her

MIKE
Look you don’t masturbate with
someone for ten months without
developing some feelings for them--

AMY
Do you have feelings for her Mike

A beat

MIKE
Yes I have feelings for her She’s
actually a pretty amazing woman
She runs her own dairy farm--

AMY

MIKE

MIKE
Can I let my boner go down first--

AMY
NO

Mike stands painfully zips up crosses to the door Stops

MIKE
Are we really doing this

AMY
Yeah I think we are

Mike nods and exits Amy just stands there reeling On the
Skype screen the NAKED WOMAN reappears consoling

NAKED WOMAN ON COMPUTER
Look I just think Mike feels
really trapped right now--

Amy clears the entire desk sending the desktop CRASHING to
the floor Then she stands there trying to breathe

She’s about to break down crying when she hears

JANE (0S)

Amy slumps A mother’s work is literally never done

GWENDOLYN (CONT’D)
I’m president of the PTA I run my
own lifestyle blog Perfectmoms
dotcom and most importantly I am
the proud mommy of two amazing
daughters Blair and Gandhi

IN THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM

The doors open and AMY slowly enters looking like a
disaster her hair is frazzled her left eye is swollen
there is coffee and food and god knows what else all over
her once white suit Onstage Gwendolyn continues her speech

GWENDOLYN
I called this emergency PTA meeting
to address an issue that radically
affects the safety of our children
(dramatic beat)
The Bake Sale

Amy just stands there and says to no one in particular

AMY
Did she just saythe bake sale

NEARBY MOM
I-I think so

Onstage Gwendolyn clicks through a very polished POWERPOINT
PRESENTATION It’s like a TED Talk

GWENDOLYN
Here is a list of toxic ingredients
that are banned from the bake sale
no BPA MSG BHA or BHT plus no
sesame or soy and obviously no
sugar or nuts or eggs or gluten or
milk or butter or salt

In the front row KIKI tentatively raises her hand confused

KIKI
So what ingredients can we use--

GWENDOLYN
To enforce these rules I am
creating a Bake Sale Police Force
who will monitor the food destroy
any offending treats and punish
the wrongdoers

AMY
Is this a joke Did she say this
was a joke before I got here

The nearby mom shakes her head no

GWENDOLYN
And the first volunteer for my Bake
Sale Police Force is
(looking up seeing Amy)
Amy Mitchell That’s what you get
for being late sweetie

AMY
W-What

GWENDOLYN
Please arrive at the Bake Sale two
hours early to get trained

And then something amazing happens Amy says the one word she
never says

AMY
No

Gwendolyn’s smile wavers unsure she heard correctly

GWENDOLYN
What’s that now

AMY

I’ve had a really long day I’ve
been burned bruised and knocked
unconscious I screwed up my
daughter’s first day of soccer and
I hand-searched my son’s poo for a
pen cap he ate and my dog has
vertigo and I have no help at home
and I feel completely alone and old
and unfuckable and I’m drowning at
work and three hours ago I may or
may not have committed a felony hit
and run And that was just today

(beat)
I can’t do this anymore I can’t
give any more of myself There’s
none of me left And there’s no way
I’m going to be on your fucking
Bake Sale Police Force I’m sorry
I’m done I quit

All the Moms stare at her shocked Amy turns and walks out
Gwendolyn just watches her aghast

EXT NORCHESTER SCHOOL -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

The bartender hesitates then Carla nods at him leave it He
does and moves off just as

VOICE BEHIND AMY
Amy There you are

Amy and Carla turn to see KIKI the smiley anxious stay-at-
home mom hurrying over to them just so excited

KIKI
I’m so so sorry to interrupt you
guys I just wanted to say that
what you did in there was amazing
You said everything I’ve ever felt
about being a mom but couldn’t say

amazing She’s not very bright

AMY
And its turned into this crazy arms
race between moms -- it’s like “oh

birthday party Ill get the entire
cast of Frozen for mine”

CARLA
When I was a kid my mom would buy
a sheetcake from 7-Eleven for my
birthday That’s it And it rocked

AMY
Yes You’d get all jacked up on
cake and off-brand soda and you’d
run around the park with your
friends and it was awesome We
didn’t need Frozen Fuck Frozen

DISSOLVE TO

LATER -- THE BOTTLE IS EMPTIER STILL
and the women are pretty buzzed

CARLA

AMY
Don’t say no to your kids

CARLA

Carla drinks disgusted as Amy and Kiki exchange a look

AMY

CARLA

Amy stares off dreamy as Kiki and Carla listen buzzed

AMY
You know what my biggest mom
fantasy is Having a quiet
breakfastby myself

Kiki and Carla nod in agreement

CARLA
Yeah that’s hot

KIKI
Sometimes when I’m driving and I’m
all alone I fantasize about getting
into a car crash Not like a big
car crash with fire and explosions
just like a little one and then I
get to go to the hospital for two
weeks and I sleep all day and watch
TV and eat jello and it’s all
covered by insurance and my family
comes and they’re so nice to me and
Kent has tears in his eyes and he
pretends it’s hay fever but we all
know why he’s crying we all know
and my kids bring balloons and the
nurses rub cream on my feet and oh
my God it’s so amazing

Kiki notices Amy and Carla looking at her like she’s nuts
KIKI (CONTD)

Is that likesomething you guys
fantasize about too No
CARLA
The only thing I fantasize about is
an old man with a ten inch dick who
wants to buy me a car

EVEN LATER -- THE BOTTLE IS NOW EMPTY
and the girls are pretty well sloshed

KIKI
--and you know who doesn’t deal
with any of this crap Men

AMY
Yup To be a great dad all you
gotta do is show up to a couple of
your kid’s soccer games That’s it
But if my daughter doesn’t play
cello and speak Portuguese and
volunteer at the homeless shelter
she built by hand from the fucking
tree farm she’s growing in our
backyard I’m a bad mom

KIKI

tired moms lips in dramatic slo mo “who are these bitches”

AMY KIKI AND CARLA ATTACK THE CEREAL AISLE

They rip open boxes of cereal and pour them in their

Then as Amy and Kiki cheer her on Carla chugs her entire

jug 90 of the fluid splashes onto her face and clothes but
she doesn’t care When she finishes she drop-kicks the empty
jug across the store Amy and Kiki jump up and down YAY Then

A SECURITY GUARD STORMS AROUND THE CORNER

and charges right at them pissed in action movie slo-mo
Amy and Kiki turn and flee laughing oh shit But Carla
frowns and runs right at the security guard like a bull

THE SECURITY GUARD SEES CARLA RUNNING RIGHT AT HIM

and he suddenly looks less confident -- umm -- then he looks
scared -- who is this chick -- and then slipping on the wet
floor he turns and hightails it away from Carla terrified
She chases him around the corner screaming insane

AMY KIKI AND CARLA RUN THROUGH THE AISLES

high-fiving the tired moms encouraging them keep going You

horror Then as the 2Chainz song builds to its epic climax

AMY KIKI AND CARLA EXIT THE SUPERMARKET

with carts full of ridiculous items Drinking a Bud Light

Amy sits at this sunny outdoor cafe reading a newspaper

happier than we’ve ever seen her A WAITER brings her a large
cup of coffee a delicious pastry and a side of bacon

AMY
Do people actually live like this

Amy’s cellphone RINGS She answers it

AMY (CONTD)
Best morning ever this is Amy

INTERCUT WITH AMY’S BOSS DALE KIPLER

as he angrily paces in his huge ultra-hip office TESSA and a
dozen HIPSTERS sit in a circle on the floor scared as Dale
barks into a speakerphone furious

DALE KIPLER
Amy where are you The Morning
Huddle started an hour ago

AMY
Yeah I’m not gonna go to those
anymore They’re a total waste of
time

Several employees stymie LAUGHTER Dale reddens embarrassed

DALE KIPLER
Are you feeling okay Amy

AMY
Never felt better Dale I’m eating
a quiet breakfast and reading a
newspaper for the first time in 12
years plus I just met a very nice
rich lady named--

Amy nods at the nearby mom whats your name

MOM
J-Janet

AMY
(back to phone)
--named Janet And I think we might
be best friends

DALE KIPLER
Listen to me Amy you need to come
into the office right now

AMY
Actually I don’t Dale I only work
for you three days a week If you
want me to work more you should
pay me to do that instead of
preying on my classically female
desire to go above and beyond
what’s asked of me--

DALE KIPLER
Whoa no one is preying on anyone--

AMY
Because it would suck for the CEO
of a company that markets itself as
pro-woman and pro-mom and whose
customer base is 68 female to get
sued by a working mom for unfair
labor practices

DALE KIPLER
Okay Okay There’s no need to talk
about lawsuits And just for the
record I am very pro-mom

AMY
Great Then act like it
(hangs up smiles at Janet)
You gonna finish your scone

so it worked out perfect--

Carla touches the LATIN BUSBOY’s hand as refills their water

CARLA (CONTD)
Thank you sir Your water service
today has been exemplary

The busboy smiles a bit confused and hurries off

AMY
So is it hard sharing your son with
your ex-husband

CARLA
Fuck no Have you seen my son He’s
nine feet tall and all he talks
about is baseball You know what’s
interesting about baseball

AMY
What

CARLA
Nothing It’s a bunch of fat
rednecks standing around chewing
tobacco in their pajamas

(MORE )
CARLA (CONTD)
Honestly I wish my son was into
collecting feathers -- it’d be way
more interesting

KIKI
Do you go to all his games

CARLA
His dad does but I just can’t
anymore The last game of his I
went to lasted six hours and the
final score was 1 to 2 In the 17th
inning I nearly took my own life I
would rather go to Iraq than to
another kid’s baseball game

AMY
And how do you think your divorce
affected your son

Carla stops looks at Amy reading between the lines

CARLA
You got problems at home

AMY
What No No I just--

CARLA
Because when married bitches ask me
900 questions about my divorce it’s
usually because they’re thinking
about doing it themselves

Amy frownsthen opens up to the girls

AMY
I found out that my husband has
been masturbating on Skype with the
same woman for ten months

CARLA
HELLO

KIKI
What’s Skype

CARLA
Did you torch his car Because you
have to torch his car that’s just
standard operating procedure--

AMY
No no it’s actually okay I
thought I’d be devastated when Mike
left but mostly I just feel
relieved And the kids don’t even
seem to notice he’s gone

CARLA
Kids are so fucking dumb

AMY
The truth isour marriage has
been over for years I just had
this vision of what a perfect
family was supposed to be like and
being divorced didn’t really fit
into that so I didn’t let my
marriage end even when it was
clearly over you know

Carla nods sympathetic

KIKI
Wow I feel really grateful for my
marriage now--

VOICE BEHIND THEM
Kiki

The girls turn to see Kiki’s husband KENT 40’s handsome
preppy Kiki immediately stands up from the table scared

Gwendolyn and her friends recoil as if slapped

VICKY LATROBE

MEAN STACY
Give it to her G

Gwendolyn inhales her fake smile tighter than ever

GWENDOLYN

state six years running

this life-changing information in a
rock garden while some weird monk
plays the flute What is the matter
with you

AMY
Jane listen No matter what

AMY

What
JANE

Debby Tiner’s parents got divorced
and now she gives handjobs to
anyone who asks for one

AMY
I don’t think that has anything to
do with her parents’ divorce

JANE

No mom that’s what happens For
the rest of my life I’m going to
struggle with intimacy and I’m
going to search for approval from
weird old men and the odds of me
getting divorced just went up like
a thousand percent Thanks mom

AMY
Baby please--

JANE
I just don’t want to be weird

okay

Tears start down Jane’s cheek Amy puts her arm around Jane

brings I love you and your dad
loves you and you will be okay I
promise

JANE
How do you know that

AMY
Because I’m your mom and I know you
better than anyone in the world

Jane frowns comforted sniffling back tears

JANE
I just had my whole life worked out
so perfectly and now it’snot
perfect anymore

AMY
I know I did too But maybe life
is supposed to be messy you know
And maybe trying to make it perfect
is what messes everything up in the
first place

Jane nods dries her eyes feeling a little better
AMY (CONTD)
Does Debbie Tiner really give

everyone handjobs

JANE

destroy you She’ll put your kids
in all the dumb classes and give
them all the crappy teachers and
forget about soccer -- your kids
wont even get milk

AMY

But isn’t that exactly why we need
to take her down She’s a bully
and she wants to turn us all into
perfect little Nazi moms just like

be hyper-stressed over-scheduled
freaks and I don’t want that My
daughter has a new rash every week
and she’s only 16 We gotta fight
back against these perfect moms

CARLA
You had me at Nazi -- let’s punch

Amy laughsthen notices her daughter studying a textbook
stressed over at the kids’ table Amy frowns concerned

AMY

studying

CARLA
Youre lucky All my kid does with
books is try to rip them in half

AMY

chill out and take life less
seriously and sometimes I feel
like I’m doing an okay job but
then like two seconds later I feel
like I’m failing miserably I just
wish I knew how I was doing you
know

KIKI
Yeah the most frustrating part of
being a mom is you have no idea if
youre doing a good job or not
until your kids are fully grown

CARLA
Yeah and then it’s too late
They’re either cool or they’re meth
head serial killers

AMY
The worst part is Jane is exactly
like me -- she wants everything to

be perfect and of course all that

insane Luckily Dylan turned out
like his dad and he’s lazy as shit

Hey guys thanks for coming out I

I’m elected we’re gonna start doing
way less Less PTA meetings less
bake sales less luncheons less
bullshit

The moms ROAR their approval In the back Gwendolyn looks
genuinely surprised by the moms’ fury

AMY (CONTD)
Our kids need a break too School
starts way too early And why do
they have six hours of homework a

kids anymore And do they really
need to take five standardized
tests a week We shouldn’t be
teaching our kids to be good test
takers we should be teaching them
to be good people

Who gives a shit if our kids don’t
go to Harvard My boss went to
Harvard and he’s a total douche

Also I think we should all stop
doing Zumba There’s no science
supporting it plus you look super
embarrassing when you do it

The crowd hesitates a bit nottotallybehind her

AMY (CONTD)
Okay I could be wrong about Zumba
but I think I’m right about the
other stuff So if you’re tired of
being overworked and under-
appreciated and if you’re tired of
your school making you feel like
shit while slowly driving your kids
insane or if you’re just a mom who
wants to do less then vote for me

INT FAMILY COUNSELLING OFFICE -- DAY

Hungover hating life Amy sits on a therapist’s couch with
MIKE They both sit as far apart as possible Across from
them sits a very positive THERAPIST smiling sunny

THERAPIST
Good morning I’d like to start by
saying that every marriage is save-
able it just takes two people who
are willing to work at it okay

Amy and Mike nod not so sure

THERAPIST (CONT’D)
Awesome Let’s begin with an
affirmation Mike and Amy I’d like
you to look at each other and say
three things that you like about
each other

Mike and Amy look at each other trying to think of 3 things

MIKE
Can I go second

THERAPIST
Sure Amy go ahead

AMY
Well I like that you gave me my
children And I like that you pick
up the kids after school sometimes
that’s really helpful And I like
that you came to therapy

THERAPIST
Great Mike your turn

MIKE
Okay um I like your spaghetti
And you make a pretty good calzone
That’s two

AMY
Do you have any that aren’t pasta

MIKE
And I like that you’ve never
crashed the car

Amy just turns to the therapist tired

AMY
Okay I know you have to be neutral
but do you see what I’m working
with here

MIKE
What What’d I do wrong

Slightly rattled the therapist smiles bravely

THERAPIST
You know what let’s try a
different tack I’d like to try a
role reversal exercise Amy I want
you to pretend to be Mike and Mike
I want you to pretend to be Amy
and now I want you to just talk
about your days

A beat Then Mike puts on a RIDICULOUS HIGH-PITCHED VOICE

MIKE (AS AMY)
Hi I’m Amy all I did today was rub
lotion on my face and talk talk
talk

AMY (AS MIKE)
What up I’m Mike Today I made
toast in the oven and stared off
into space

THERAPIST
We usually don’t do the voices but
okay How does it feel to be your
partner

MIKE (AS AMY)
I feel great I’ve got a super-
chill husband and two healthy kids
and a beautiful house and a fully-
loaded minivan and a closet packed
with expensive clothes I never wear
-- my life is amazing I really
don’t know why I sit around all day
complaining and eating cake

THERAPIST
Wow Okay Amy would you like to--
AMY
Yes I would
(as Mike)

Hey I’m Mike and I have no idea
how good I have it I’ve got a wife
who takes care of everything in the
world for me and all I have to do

is not jack off on Skype three

times a day but I still do that
anyway because I’m a fucking idiot--

THERAPIST
Okay guys this has officially gone
off the rails--

MIKE (AS AMY)
Actually I’m the idiot I don’t
even know how to work the TV
remote It’s like “Help I’m a girl
what do all these clearly-labelled
buttons do”

AMY (AS MIKE)
Hey Doc we’ve been here five
minutes can I splooge all over your
computer now

THERAPIST
Okay that’s just gross--

MIKE (AS AMY)
I’m too judgemental to ever love
someone

AMY (AS MIKE)
Im too self-centered to ever love
someone--

THERAPIST
ENOUGH Enough Okay look I know
I started out saying all marriages
can be savedbut it ain’t gonna
happen for you guys

Amy and Mike look surprised by the therapist’s candor

MIKE
You don’t even think we should
stick it out for the kids

THERAPIST
In my experience parents who stay
in unhappy marriages for their kids
just end up making their kids twice
as unhappy

AMY
So what should we do

THERAPIST
As a therapist I’m not allowed to
tell you what to do But as a human
being with two fucking eyes in my
head I think you should get
divorced as soon as possible

Amy inhales wow After a moment she looks over at Mike

AMY
What do you think Mike

A long SILENCE then Mike nods I agree Amy nods too

EXT FAMILY COUNSELLING OFFICE -- DAY

Amy and Mike slowly exit the therapist’s office together

AMY
Sometimes I’m too strict with my
kids sometimes I’m too nice and
sometimes I’m just a crazy bitch
who doesn’t make any sense

A couple MOMS in the audience CHUCKLE knowingly

AMY (CONTD)
What works on my daughter almost
never works on my son and whenever
I think I might actually be
figuring my kids out they grow
older and I’m back to square one
The truth is when it comes to
being a momI have no fucking
clue what I’m doing

More knowing LAUGHTER from the moms

AMY (CONTD)
But you know what I don’t think
anyone does

SCATTERED APPLAUSE Kiki and Carla look around surprised

AMY (CONTD)
I think we’re all bad moms And you
know why Because being a mom today
is fucking impossible

Even MORE APPLAUSE Amy is starting to win over the crowd

AMY (CONTD)
So can we all just stop pretending
like we’ve got it all figured out
and maybe stop judging each other
all the time

The APPLAUSE grows Kiki whispers to Carla excited

KIKI
Shes doing great

CARLA
I know I never doubted her

Onstage Amy starts gathering steam her confidence growing

AMY
I’m running for PTA president
because I want our school to be a
place where you don’t have to be
perfect

(MORE )

AMY (CONTD)
A place where you can be yourself
and make mistakes and where you’re
judged by how hard you’re trying
not by what you bring to the
fucking bake sale

BIGGER APPLAUSE In her seat Gwendolyn shifts uncomfortably

AMY (CONT’D)
I want our school to be a place
where it’s okay to be a bad mom--

Just then a MOM stands up excited

MOM

weeks

All the moms LAUGH and APPLAUD

AMY
Yes We all do that sometimes--

Then a HIPPY MOM stands

HIPPY MOM
I confiscated my daughter’s pot and
then I smoked the shit out of it

More LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE

AMY

Then a TIGER MOM stands up

TIGER MOM
I drove over my son’s violin
because I couldn’t go to another
fucking recital I just couldn’t

The moms APPLAUD LIKE CRAZY More and more moms stand and
confess their bad mom transgressions

AMY
I know Thanks for getting me off
my couch and making me do this

CARLA
Of course it was all my idea

KIKI
No it wasn’t--

CARLA
Not now Kiki we’re having a moment

AMY
You know it’s funny I gave up so
many things when I became a mom
but I think the biggest thing I
gave up was having friends And I
had no idea how much I missed that
until I met you guys

KIKI
I know I didn’t have any friends
either I was so alone

CARLA
Yeah you were pretty much the
first bitches at this school to
ever talk to me

Amy smiles at her two fellow loners heartfelt

AMY

I’m so glad we found each other
CARLA

Me too
KIKI

GWENDOLYN CRYING IN HER RANGE ROVER
Amy’s smile fades and after a moment she excuses herself

AMY
Just give me a second okay

Amy crosses the lawn reaches the RANGE ROVER and gently
raps on the window Gwendolyn looks up sees Amy and lowers
her window scowling

GWENDOLYN
What did you come to gloat

AMY
No I just wanted to see if you
were okay

GWENDOLYN
(wiping away tears)
Yeah I’m fine everything’s fine

AMY
Okay well if you want to--

GWENDOLYN
It’s just that the PTA was the one
good thing left in my life and now
it’s gone too

AMY
Oh come on your life is awesome
You have like three boats

GWENDOLYN
Oh God my life is so not awesome
Both of my parents are dying of
cancer and my husband is being
investigated by the FBI for
embezzling 300 million dollars from
Iceland -- spoiler alert he did it
-- and my secret son who nobody
knows about is living on the street
again and I’m basically the only
thing holding my family together
but it’s cool everything’s cool I’m
sure we’ll be fine

Gwendolyn QUIETLY CRIES a total mess Amy is floored

AMY
Jesus Gwendolyn I had no idea

Amy takes Gwendolyn’s arm really feeling for her
AMY (CONT’D)

GWENDOLYN

GWENDOLYN

Oh my God I would love that I have
so many ideas
