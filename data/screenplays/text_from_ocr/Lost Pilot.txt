“Pilot”
ACT ONE

OVER BLACKNESS MUSIC OMINOUS AND FOREBODING THEN OUT OF
THE DARKNESS A SINGLE WORD FLOATING IN SPACE OUT OF
FOCUS TOWARD CAMERA AS IT APPROACHES IT COMES INTO FOCUS
BUT ITS SHARP ONLY FOR A BRIEF MOMENT

LOST

AS IT NEARS US IT AGAIN LOSES FOCUS -- AND AS WE MOVE THROUGH
THE O OUR MUSIC CRESCENDOS THEN STOPS ABRUPTLY AS WE CUT
TO

A MANS EYE

EXTREME CLOSEUP Open wide The mans skin wet speckled
with soil and flecks of blood His breathing CLOSELY MIKED --
erratic This mans in shock The SOUNDS of INSECTS and
ANIMALS other-worldly A blink

Then the REVERSE ANGLE staring up hundreds of BAMBOO
STALKS Sunlight almost impenetrable through the dense
forest

SLIGHTLY WIDER on the Mans face as he stares upward
disoriented stunned 40-years-old Fit In normal
circumstances one glance would make you feel confident in
him Trusting But here now hes the one in trauma

His name is JACK

Then a RUSTLING SOUND -- something COMING -- it gets LOUDER
and Jack suddenly SNAPS his head to the side to see something
appear through the thick bamboo foliage --

A WHITE LABRADOR

Collar Tags It stops abruptly twenty feet away from
Jack looking at him And for the first time we PULL BACK
TO A WIDE SHOT of the intense alien-looking BAMBOO FOREST
The dog just stares at Jack who we now see wears a BUSINESS

SUIT and lies on his back caught in broken bamboo stalks
And Jack just stares back

Its an odd tableau -- man and dog looking at each other
both entirely out of place

Finally the Lab turns and huffs back into the jungle
disappearing in the claustrophobic bamboo -- and Jack would
call out Wait if he could even think that clearly and he
turns to sit up and its a PAINFUL MOVE -- he manages to
extricate himself from the plants -- and while still on his
knees he opens up his suit jacket to check out the source of
his pain Something on his left side -- but were so TIGHT
on his face that whatever he sees we dont Yet

His reaction to his wound is more disappointed than
terrified He manages to get to his feet feeling something
in his jacket pocket He reaches in and pulls out a
MINIATURE BOTTLE OF VODKA

And we HOLD ON his face as he looks at it considering
his heart beginning to POUND his fear growing as does a
SOUND -- a FRIGHTENING ODD SOUND -- something REVVING in the
distance -- SOMETHING LOUD -- and the horror of what he
suddenly understands far outweighs any physical pain He
moves off --

EXT BAMBOO FOREST - DAY

Jack moves as fast as he can through the THICK BAMBOO -- and

as he goes theres something that almost beckons to him -- he
hurries through the thick growth his determined eyes focused
on the thing he approaches -- and as he gets closer to it we
finally see it

A WHITE TENNIS SHOE

Laces untied caught mid-fall in a bamboo tree hanging by a
branch twelve feet above ground He stops for a moment
looks at it Again THE LOUD REVVING -- but its CLOSER NOW -
- and suddenly the most important thing in the world is that
he get there and fast -- so hes moving now even faster than
before -- through a straight-away miracle path hes near
SPRINTING now -- BREATHING QUICKLY ERRATICALLY as he makes
his way --

EXT BRUSH - DAY

-- and now hes running from bamboo into JUNGLE BRUSH --
thick still but theres some more sunlight and hes almost
there and finally he bursts out of the brush onto --

EXT BEACH - DAY

-- and Jack runs up finally stopping dead in an EXTREME
CLOSEUP

Hes bathed in SUNLIGHT now -- squinting at what he sees --
and were just on his eyes HOLD ON HIM in shock until he
moves forward -- and IN THE SAME SHOT we PAN AS HE MOVES --
180 DEGREES UNTIL WERE BEHIND HIM LOOKING OUT ON SOMETHING
ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC Only twenty yards away

A PLANE CRASH ON THE BEACH 6

777 -- PASSENGER AIRLINER -- 250-Seater -- the MIDDLE SECTION
of the fuselage PLOWED INTO THE SAND -- one WING STICKING
STRAIGHT UP TOWERING SEVEN STORIES INTO THE SKY sporadic
SPARKS BURSTING FROM THE INVERTED ENGINE showering down on
the absolute MAYHEM on the sand --

ANGLE 7

-- and it is like a fucking WARZONE scattered FIRES and
wreckage -- DOZENS OF PEOPLE RUNNING ABOUT some injured
others not -- theyre helping each other SCREAMING -- their
cries drowned out by the SOUND and WIND caused by the
ENORMOUS JET ENGINE -- no not the one on the wing pointing
upward -- the other one -- the one on the INVERTED WING now
cracked off its brackets and resting at SAND LEVEL And the
ENGINE STILL REVS -- SPASTICALLY ERRATICALLY -- SPEWING
COOLANT and SPARKS and SUCKING IN SAND every time it
THROTTLES UP --

TIGHT ON JACK 8
as he takes this in overwhelmed -- knowing hes part of it --
his eyes WELL UP in fear -- sorrow -- confusion -- and he

turns to look for help --
ANGLE 9

-- but what he sees is nothing His look spans 360
degrees theres only spectacular ocean waves violently

CRASHING as far as a half mile from shore -- a distant

coastline -- then MOUNTAINS -- jagged 2000-foot high peeks --

a deep valley of JUNGLE -- then his eyes are back on the

horror of the CRASH --

ANGLE 10
-- where DOZENS OF LIVES are in the balance -- and all at

once he knows that some -- perhaps most -- will die if he
doesnt take action -- and so he does --

EXT CRASH SITE - DAY 11
Chaos Terror Smoke fumes fire -- people desperately

trying to help each other -- running screaming -- everything

happening at once --

ANGLE 12

And amid the madness the JET ENGINE MOMENTARILY REVS DOWN --
enough to HEAR A MANS SCREAM -- Jack turns to the source a

MAN is caught -- STUCK UNDERNEATH two rows of airplane seats

-- ten feet to the side of the malfunctioning engine --

Jack hurries across the insanity toward the man -- flash-
passing pieces of conversation as he runs --

KOREAN MAN MAN 1
(searching for his wife) -- GET AWAY FROM THE GAS
-- SUN SUN STAY OVER THERE
WOMAN 2 MAN 2
-- SHE WAS RIGHT HERE I I NEED SOME HELP PLEASE--
DONT KNOW
ANGLE 13

-- Jack races past a pretty 20-year-old girl who we HOLD ON
for a moment -- she just stands there SCREAMING LIKE A
MOTHERFUCKER Well meet her later

ANGLE 14
Jack gets to the man stuck under the seats -- hes too close
to the terrifying LOUD ENGINE -- which is still so hot that
HEAT RIPPLES can be seen behind Jack -- who sweats now as he

tries to LIFT THE ROW OF SEATS off the man --

With the DEAFENING VOLUME of the jet drowning out any
dialogue we see Jack YELLING for TWO MEN close by (one of
them is LOCKE 58 someone else well get to know in a bit) --
they run over and help -- and the three STRAIN HARD as they
lift the chair sections off -- Jack then moves to the man --
whose leg BLEEDS SEVERELY

Jack rips off his tie immediately goes to business the way
only a man with medical training could he begins making a
TOURNIQUET tying the injured mans leg off --

ANGLE 15
As he ties the leg Jack looks up to see a whole mess of
simultaneous emergencies -- including a 60-year-old WOMAN in

a PEACH BLOUSE who lies unconscious with a 30-year-old MAN
desperately trying to revive her --

WHIP PAN 16

across the beach of debris to a PREGNANT WOMAN on her knees
struggling to stand but with no one to help --

ANGLE 17

Jack then yells to the two Men hes with to take the

Tourniquet Man to safety -- and Jack RUNS -- OVER THE WING

BEHIND THE MONSTROUS REVVING ENGINE -- 18

over to the Australian Pregnant Woman (CLAIRE) -- he helps

her up -- helps her walk -- but she stumbles again strains
CLAIRE

-- Im having contractions--
Jack helps her lie down--
JACK
-- thats not ideal how many months
pregnant are you--
CLAIRE
(crying)
-- almost eight months--

ANGLE 19

-- and he glances up checking on the unconscious 60-year-old
Woman in the peach blouse the 30-year-old Man still trying

to revive her -- though his eyes are there he asks Claire
ANGLE 20
JACK
-- how far apart are they--
CLAIRE
-- I dont know a few of em just
happened--
AND WE CUT BACK 21

to the two Men carrying Tourniquet Man away from --

THE LOUD ENGINE 22
-- and theyre at a safe distance -- thats when ANOTHER MAN
his back to us -- someone we havent seen -- runs past us

just in front of the massive engine -- just as it REVS FULL

BLAST -- AND THE MAN GETS SUCKED INTO THE ENGINE AND JUST AS
HE HITS THE BLADES WE CUT BACK TO

JACK 23

With Claire as the engine EXPLODES in the distance behind
them -- camera ROCKED Claire SCREAMS Jack COVERS Claire
with his body as debris falls -- LITTERING THE SITE WITH

PIECES OF FIERY DEBRIS

ANGLE 24
At least the HORRIBLE ENGINE NOISE IS GONE now -- and with
Jacks horrified face close to Claires he forces himself to
appear calm -- to his focus on her
JACK
-- listen to me-- listen to me youre
gonna be okay -- do you understand But

you need to lie absolutely st--

CLAIRE
(suddenly winces scared)
-- There -- God thats a big one--

JACK
-- okay --
(looks up calls out)

The random person who turns is a MAN -- a large guy more or
less frozen in terror -- this is HURLEY

JACK (CONTD)
COME HERE

HURLEY
-- The -- the plane crashed--

JACK
Yeah I know -- get over here

And Hurley does -- in this moment he might just follow anyone
anywhere -- Jack rips off his watch gives it to him

JACK (CONTD) HURLEY
-- I need you to get this
woman away from these fumes
Take her over there -- Then -- okay-- okay--

move If her contractions
occur closer than three
minutes apart call out for

Claire)

CLAIRE

Jacks already up -- Hurley calling out

HURLEY
-- Hey whats your name

And here it is the first time weve heard it

JACK
Jack

And Hurley turns back to Claire who says crying

CLAIRE
-- Im sorry --

Hurley quickly begins helping Claire up -- and though
terrified he tries to comfort her --

HURLEY
-- Dont be sorry -- this wasnt your
fault--

25 WITH JACK NOW
-- as he runs to the unconscious 60-year-old Peach Blouse

Woman (ROSE) -- immediately taking over for the 30-year-old
whose name is BOONE

JACK BOONE
-- stop -- her heads not
tilted far back enough -- -- are you sure Ima
youre blowing air into her lifeguard Im licensed

stomach--

(as he does the work)
-- you seriously need to
think about giving back that
license --

And Jacks performing it now on Rose the way it should be --
breath breath pump pump pump --

BOONE
Thats exactly what I was doing

ANGLE - HURLEY AND CLAIRE 26

As Hurley moves with Claire to an area on the other side of

the plane -- Claire lying down again in pain on the sand
ANGLE - JACK AND ROSE 27
As he keeps trying CPR on her -- Boone watching --
BOONE
-- Hey man shes still not breathing
(then)
Maybe we need to do one of those hole
things -- where you stick a pen in her
throat
JACK
(just get the fuck outta here)
-- Yeah good idea -- you go get me a
pen
And Boone hurries off -- Jack just relieved to be rid of
him goes back to Rose -- trying to bring her back -- when
suddenly WREEEEEEEEEEORRRRRR -- a LOUD METALLIC WHINE

which makes Jack TURN AROUND to look --

Dear God its --

THE FUCKING WING 28
-- THE 75-FOOT WING POINTING TOWARD GOD -- ITS ACTUALLY
BENDING AT THE FUSELAGE WHERE ITS CRACKED -- ITS STOPPED

FOR THE MOMENT BUT ITS CLEAR THIS THING IS MOMENTS AWAY
FROM CRASHING DOWN UPON THE SAND -- WHIP PAN down to the sand
-- WHERE HURLEY AND CLAIRE REST ON THE SAND oblivious -- and
in the direct path of the enormous metallic WING FULL OF FUEL
-- HORRIFIED --

JACK WORKS ON THE WOMAN FASTER NOW 29

JACK
-- Come on Come on

AND THE WING BENDS AGAIN -- 30

about to go -- a SHOT FROM ABOVE THE WING -- FUEL SPRAYING
FROM IT --

JACK KEEPS PUMPING -- PUMPING -- 31

Suddenly ROSE GASPS FOR BREATH -- horrified disoriented but
ALIVE --

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

ANGLE 32
Seeing this Jacks already RUNNING NOW as the WING BENDS
AGAIN -- CRACKS MORE -- and as Jack runs he yells out
JACK

Hurley turns -- sees Jack approach -- Hurleys confused
HURLEY
You -- you said dont move
JACK

HURLEY TURNS -- SEES THE WING -- WEEEREEEREEEEEORRRRRRR 33

HURLEY SCREAMS AS THE WING STARTS TO GO -- a LONG LENS SHOT
as JACK ARRIVES -- GRABS THEM PULLS THEM TO THEIR FEET AND
RUSHES THEM AWAY AS THE WING FALLS RIGHT BEHIND THEM LIKE A
TIPPING REDWOOD TREE --

-- AND THE WING SMASHES TO THE GROUND 34
LANDING ON pieces of FIERY ENGINE DEBRIS and KA-BOOOOOOOM

THE WING EXPLODES -- AN ENORMOUS BLAST -- pieces of FIERY
METAL RAIN EVERYWHERE -—-—

JACK 35
instinctively protecting Claire SCARED BUT DETERMINED --

JACK
-- You okay

She nods -- fast --
JACK (CONTD)
(to Hurley)

Jack gets up and moves off --
EXT CRASH SITE - DAY 36
Now were LONG LENS as Jack walks through the wreckage scene

-- amid smoldering piles of debris and People helping each
other Things seem to finally be calming down

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

JACK SCANS THE AREA 37

looking to make sure theres nothing that needs an urgent
response He finds one MAN 45 in a suit who lies on the
ground unconscious BLEEDING BADLY from the head Jack
pulls open the Mans jacket -- TO REVEAL A PIECE OF METAL
SHRAPNEL STUCK INTO HIS STOMACH

Seeing this Jacks eyes go flush with concern He checks
SHRAPNEL MANs pulse -- pulls open his eyelids Jack
delicately removes the mans jacket drapes it over him
forming a makeshift BLANKET Jack turns to the ripped-open
end of the fuselage -- where first class and the cockpit
would normally be --

INT FUSELAGE - DAY 38

INSIDE the fuselage looking out the tumultuous OCEAN framed
by this giant shattered aluminum tube Its a disorienting
shot since the plane is BANKED ON ITS SIDE At this angle
SEATS are on a SIDE WALL the wreckage-strewn floor actually
a long row of windows

And Jack appears looking into the fuselage -- and we PUSH IN
ON HIM What Jack sees -- despite his ER training -- sickens
him Then Boone arrives urgent holding a HANDFUL OF PENS

BOONE
-- I didnt know which one would work best

For a long beat Jacks eyes dont leave the fuselage
Finally he looks at Boone And the pens And tears well in
Jacks eyes -- the whole experience finally catching up to
him Jack takes all of the pens saying softly
emotionally kindly

JACK
--Theyre all good Thanks

And Jack walks off past Boone who turns watching Jack go
EXT BEACH - DAY 39
A fifty-yard distance from the wreckage a fellow survivor
stands here staring almost angrily at the wrecked plane

Hes 35 handsome with a cocky self-centered vibe And

hes smoking Meet SAWYER

A few others recover about here -- including another Man who
approaches 25 English rocker Self-deprecating --

somewhere between an adult and a child This is CHARLIE
These two have never spoken

CHARLIE SAWYER

-- You uh scuse me ya

Charlie walks off A beat later he returns --

CHARLIE (CONTD)
-- Mind if I bum one then Thanks

Charlie takes a cig from tough Sawyer then walks off
EXT CRASH SITE - DAY 40

MUSIC Synthesizer DRONE A surreal post-disaster moment
LONG LENS SHOT as Jack for the first time appearing
vulnerable -- perhaps even weak -- near the jets open CARGO
DOOR He rummages through a strangers SUITCASE other
bags hes already searched beside it As he ZIPS open
someones TOILETRY BAG --

EXT BEACH WOODS - DAY 4l

A cluster of trees off the beach The SHATTERED JET barely
visible in the distance Jack walks in here getting away
from the others

TIGHT SHOTS as he sets down on a large rock a TRAVEL SEWING
KIT A LIGHTER A T-shirt

And in some pain Jack pulls off his jacket -- revealing an
enormous BLOOD STAIN and RIP on the side of his shirt He
carefully removes his shirt Looks down at the LARGE SLASH --
A DEEP SIX INCH CUT STARTING ON HIS LEFT SIDE AND RUNNING TO
HIS BACK

Christ he did all that with this crash wound

He twists trying to figure out how best to sew himself up
He angles around -- cant find a good way to approach this
And we watch him for a long beat feeling for Jack as he
tries to solve this painful puzzle Frustrated but needing
help Jack looks around -- we pop to a TIGHT SHOT as he sees
something off-camera Something that makes him stop

- and we see his point of view walking slowly seemingly
aimless through the brush is a WOMAN

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

41

Shes thirty feet away her back to us Jack watches her for
a moment Then he calls out

JACK
Excuse me

And this woman turns Her face pale ghostly Wracked in
stress Eyes wet This is KATE Pretty 26 years-old
Smart Trustworthy And in all the important ways
entirely untested

JACK (CONTD)
Dyever use a needle

And Kate just stares at him for a moment disoriented

KATE
d-- what

JACK
Have you ever patched up a pair of jeans

KATE
(beat about to cry)

- I I made the drapes in my apartment
--

JACK
Thats fantastic -- dyou have a second
I need a little help

Kate takes a post-traumatic-stress-disorder beat then moves
forward through the trees She arrives at Jack

KATE
-Help with what

And Jack turns SHOWING HER THE WOUND

JACK
This

And her eyes just close
JACK (CONTD)
Id do it myself -- Im a doctor -- but I
just cant reach it
KATE

(eyes closed)
You want me to sew that up

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary 4l
JACK KATE
Its just like drapes same -- No I used a sewing
thing-- machine on the drapes --
JACK

You can do this Im telling you If you
wouldnt mind

A beat Finally Kate snaps into agreement shell do it

JACK (CONTD)
-- Thank you --

And Jack pulls from his pocket the mini bottle of VODKA
Holds it out to her as if offering a drink Odd Then

JACK (CONTD)
Its for your hands

Understanding now she takes the vodka cleans her hands with
it

JACK (CONTD)
Save some for me
(off her look smiles)
The wound

She nods gives back the half empty bottle as he gives her
the needle and thread

JACK (CONTD)
Youre gonna have to sterilize the
needle

She takes the stuff using the lighter to heat the needle

Jack sits on the rock sucks in a sharp intake of breath as

he pours the remaining vodka over his wound -- it fucking
STINGS --
Kates finished with the needle -- considers the SIX COLORS

OF THREAD in the travel sewing kit

KATE
Any uh color preference

Jack looks at her -- there it was the first flash of her
personality

JACK
Standard black

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary 41

Kate nods trying to stay cool pulling out a length of black
thread and threads the needle Kate then kneels beside him --
and after a beat she starts to sew his skin Then

KATE
So I might throw up on you

JACK
(it hurts but)
Youre doing fine

He watches her this pretty young woman he doesnt know
stitching him back together again trying to keep her
composure CLOSE ON her hands No jewelry no watch

JACK (CONTD)
You live in New York

God she just wants to lose it But she doesnt

KATE
I used to Ive been in New Zealand
About a year

JACK
--How come

KATE
Oh I just had to get away --

-- And suddenly Kate is crying It just caught up to her
thats all And she weeps resting her head on the back of
her hand Jack suddenly feels guilty watching this kind
stranger weep So he speaks quietly sweetly

JACK
-Hey hey listen I can get someone
else to do this--

KATE
-- No No Im okay

And Kate gathers her strength -- shows a small sign that
shes not someone to give up She SNIFFLES gathers herself
Knows she must She continues sewing

KATE (CONTD)
You dont seem afraid at all I dont
understand that

JACK
Fears sort of an odd thing Its like
an in-law who just drops in

(MORE)

JACK (CONTD)
You dont like it but you cant just get
rid of it Its a struggle But you
have to learn to deal with it or itll
make you insane

KATE
I havent had much success with fear

Sensing she needs some help as she works on him Jack offers

JACK
When I was in residency my first solo
procedure was a spinal surgery on a
sixteen year-old kid Girl

(beat)
At the end of it -- thirteen hours later
-- I was closing her up and I I
accidentally ripped her dural sack -- you

know what that is

Kate has stopped sewing now staring at him

JACK (CONTD)
Its at the base of the spine where all
the nerves come together Membrane as
thin as tissue So it ripped open -- the
nerves just spilled out like angel hair
pasta-- her spinal fluid flowing out and

I just froze Cause I knew If I
didnt get those nerves back in that sack
and sew it up those thirteen hours

were for nothing that girl would be
paralyzed I had about a minute
(beat)
And all the assistants were just watching
me I could feel their eyes And the
terror was so crazy so real and I
knew I had to deal with it So I just
made a choice Id let the fear in Let
it take over Let it do its thing
(looks at Kate)
But only for five seconds Thats all I
was gonna give it So I started to count

to five I could feel it inside -- like
when you drink a milkshake on a hot day
(beat)
One two three four five
(beat)

And it was gone I got back to work
Sewed her up She was fine

Kate breathes again returns to stitching him

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary 41

JACK (CONTD)
I think everyone has something like that
A moment where you establish your
relationship with fear And either you
learn to deal with it or you dont

From Kate a little sad laugh
KATE
If that had been me I think I wouldve
run for the closest door
JACK
No I dont think thats true
(then)
Youre not running now

And Kate stops -- looks up at him Her eyes clearly saying
Oh yes I am

We mustve been close to 40000 feet when
it happened

Then a crude MODEL OF A PLANE appears -- maybe eight inches
long CUT out of that BANANA LEAF and held by Jacks HAND

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
When we hit a pocket of dead air

Now we see that we are

EXT BEACH - NIGHT 52
Bonfires and other survivors in the distance Jack and Kate

are together here using a piece of wreckage as a table

Jack holds the model plane re-enacting the pre-crash

moments trying to make sense of it all Kates hands are
clasped at her mouth as she watches closely intensely

JACK
We dropped Mustve been two-hundred
feet The turbulence that followed by
far the worst Ive ever been through
but turbulence doesnt bring down planes
(beat)
Electrical power came in and out
Sounded like the hydraulics went out It
was pretty clear what was happening
(beat)
How long would you say that lasted
KATE
Five minutes
JACK
Yeah thats what I was thinking
(beat)
There was too much stress on the
structure of the plane
(beat)
Thats when the tail broke away
And Jack snaps off the tail -- he now slowly turns the
fuselage rolling it -- and you can imagine how terrifying
this actually was -- as he does this Kate watches the model
tears in her eyes
JACK (CONTD)
-- We were out of control We actually
went up for a while Then dropping
flipping
(then it occurs to him)
What row where you in
KATE
27
JACK

(then)
-I blacked out
And God this is the worst memory of all time Still Kate
fights for her composure as she says
KATE
(unfortunately)
I didnt
(beat with dread)
I saw the whole thing We were
falling I knew the tail was gone I
couldnt make myself look back

KATE (CONTD)
(then)
Then the the front section came apart

Jack rips off the nose section -- slowly cartwheeling the
leaf model

JACK
-- Did it hit something

KATE
It might have
(beat wipes away a tear)
We crashed maybe five seconds later

And Jack lets the model come down -- in a position resembling
what we saw at the opening The ANGLE IS LOW NOW -- MACRO --
it looks like the opening in model form Jack considers
this Sort of studies the image trying to figure it out

JACK

The front end of the fuselage isnt on
the beach Neithers the tail I woke
up about five hundred yards away from the
beach mustve fallen out while the
fuselage was cartwheeling

(realizes his own amazing luck

then)
We need to figure out which way we came in

KATE
Why

JACK
Because theres a chance we could find
the cockpit If its still intact there
could be a transceiver That would let
us send a signal help a rescue party
find us

KATE
(a little bit of awe)
How do you know all that

JACK
I took a couple of flying lessons
(forces a smile)
Wasnt for me

KATE JACK
I saw some smoke From the
beach -- about a mile inland -- Where
(pointing)

-- through the valley From
the jungle there

His eyes on the blackness of the night As he stares in his
gut knowing its the cockpit Kate says

KATE
If youre going for the cockpit Im
going with you
(determined)
Well leave as soon as its light

Jack cant help but delight in this resolute young woman

JACK
I dont know your name

KATE
Im Kate

JACK
Jack
(smiles)
So what were you doing in New Zealand

Now that the topic of conversation has shifted Kate stiffens
momentarily Then --

KATE
Everything Feels like
(off Jacks curiosity)
I was uh mixing paint for a while
At a hardware store I worked for a
veterinarian in Lumsden

JACK
Lumsden

KATE
(enough about me pal)
So whats up with the tattoos Jack You
one of those really hardcore spinal
surgeons or what

Now its JACKs turn to stiffen But before he can answer --

MWOOQOOOQOQO0OQOQO0000O0RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR Jack and Kate turn --
listening to --

53 A SOUND 53

FUCKING INDESCRIBABLE -- UNLIKE ANYTHING WEVE EVER HEARD
BEFORE -- TERRIFYINGLY PRIMITIVE -- PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

OTHER SURVIVORS 54

Turn in the distance looking scared as Kate enters frame in
FOREGROUND -- in EXTREME CLOSEUP --

KATE
(at a whisper)
--What was that

And Jack walks up behind her looking out -- with no answer --
ANGLE - LOCKE 55
PUSH IN ON HIM as he turns back toward the jungle -- seated

as he has been for hours staring out to sea Locke doesnt
seem scared as much as accepting of whatever challenge this
is This guys somehow accepted his mortality in a way that
can only inevitably be frightening

ANGLE - WALT AND MICHAEL 56
The boys sitting up -- eagerly reacting to the sound --
somehow HOPEFUL -- Michael seen behind him concerned -- both

looking toward the distant jungle --

WALT
-- I think thats Vincent --

MICHAEL
(beat afraid)
-- Thats not Vincent --

ANGLE - CLAIRE 57

Mid-way through her meal Claire is turned eyes on the
distant jungle valley --

CLAIRE
-- Did anyone hear that sound --

DOLLY to find Hurley getting to his feet and moving forward

HURLEY
-I think uh unfortunately all of us
did
Suddenly -- THE SOUND AGAIN -- and -- WORSE -- Hurley TURNS

toward the source of the SOUND --

ANGLE - TREES 58
Distant 50-foot tall TREES SWAY -- hundreds of yards away --

PAN to Jack and Kate -- who step forward -- moving closer to

the scary SOUND --

ANGLE - SHANNON AND BOONE 59
Sitting but already alert --

SHANNON
-- Okay this isnt funny--

Boone gets up -- moves to get closer to maybe see something --
Shannon is on her feet pissed --

SHANNON (CONTD)

-- Boone -- wait --
ANGLE - SAYID AND CHARLIE 60
-- And the Others at the bonfire -- start to move toward the
noise --
ANGLE - THE GROUP 61

And all of the characters weve met so far gather on the
beach -- in a sort of tiered way -- Jack and Kate near the
front Theres a long silence all of them watching
afraid -- then suddenly GASPS as all their heads
simultaneously TURN to --

ANOTHER PART OF THE JUNGLE -- 62
where a SERIES OF DISTANT TREES SWAY as if something SCARY-

BIG is moving -- A FEW ACRES IN SECONDS -- this huge THING --
whatever the hell it is -- seems to be disappearing into the
jungle --

-- AN WE HOLD ON OUR TERRIFIED MAIN CHARACTERS 63

for a long beat until finally

CHARLIE
Terrific

FADE IN
THOUSANDS OF FEET ABOVE PURE TURQUOISE OCEAN STRETCHING FOR
MILES AND MILES AND MILES -- MOVING OVER AN ENDLESS EXPANSE
OF BLUE
And we begin to PULL BACK TO REVEAL
INT PLANE - FLYING - DAY

This was Jacks POV -- as he still stares out the window
contemplating something pretty heavy Then

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 1
-Hows the drink

Jack turns -- looking up at the pretty Australian FLIGHT
ATTENDANT
JACK
(bad)
Its good

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 1
That wasnt a very strong reaction

JACK
Its not a very strong drink

So she slips a couple MINI-BOTTLES of VODKA from her cart to
Jack

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 1
(quiet playful)
Shh

JACK
(leans in sotto
conspiratorial)
This of course breaks some critical FAA
regulations --

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 1
I saw you when you got on Giving your
first class ticket to that older lady

JACK
Oh I wasnt being sweet She guilted me
into it Shes like six-hundred years
old and says shes never flown before
(gimme a break)
Come on

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 1
You think its all an act

JACK
Im pretty sure

Smiling she walks off toward the rear of the plane -- where
she has words with another Passenger a few rows back Jack
is smiling too hoping shell be back again soon Pleased
Jack twists open one of the bottles empties it into his
DRINK DOWNS the whole thing

He puts the other mini-bottle into his jacket pocket

Unbuckles his seatbelt gets out of his seat just as CHARLIE
quickly pushes past heading toward the front of the plane at

a swift clip -- a man on a mission --
CHARLIE
Sorry
ROSE

Guess he really had to go

Jack smiles at ROSE seated across the row from him Of
course he has no idea that he will in short order save this
womans life

Suddenly light TURBULENCE Just a little No big deal
DING -- FASTEN SEATBELTS LIGHTS UP Jack becomes visibly
tense does his best not to let it show --

FLIGHT ATTENDANTS VOICE
Ladies and gentleman the pilot has
turned on the fasten seatbelts sign --
please return to your seats with your
seatbelts fastened

Jack glances at Rose nervously clutching her armrest

JACK
Its normal

ROSE
(grateful)
-Oh I know
(then)
Ive just never been a good flier My
husband always reminds me that planes
want to be in the air

JACK
Well he sounds like a smart man

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

ROSE
(smiles)
You be sure and tell him that when he
gets back from the bathroom

The plane SHAKES again Jack smiles at Rose and we almost
get the sense its easier for him to focus on her fear than
deal with his own --

JACK
Ill keep you company til he does
(clicks seatbelt)
Dont worry itll be over in a --

AND THE PLANE DROPS TWO HUNDRED FEET IN TWO SECONDS --
SCREAMS ENGINE WHINES AND THREE PEOPLE AND EVERY LOOSE
OBJECT SLAM TO THE CEILING -- JACK GRIPS THE ARMRESTS AS THE
PLANE SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY AND WE SMASH CUT TO --

EXT BEACH - DAWN

CRASHING WAVES and were TIGHT ON JACK his eyes focused out
across the water as the SUN RISES Remembering the horror as
the SUN RISES Its an unadulterated moment of PURE ISLAND
BEAUTY -- and Jack now in a clean white T-shirt takes it
in

Were DOLLYING Jack in FOREGROUND CLOSEUP as behind him the
Survivors are mostly grouped together now -- nobody slept --
theyre all wired SCARED -- and Walt stands among them
looking up at this strange collection of adults all talking
over each other about that THING from the night before --

MICHAEL
It wasnt natural whatever it was
ROSE
-- that sound it made -- I keep thinking
there was something familiar about it
SHANNON
Really Where are you from
ROSE
The Bronx
CHARLIE

It couldve been something like monkeys

SAWYER
Yeah Im sure it was monkeys Its
Monkey Island

HURLEY
Technically you know we dont even know

SAYID
(if he knows anything)
-- Were on an island

This is all just buzz to Jack -- the same conversation has
been going all night Hes still in his own head space as
Kate arrives close -- almost conspiratorial

KATE

You ready
Jack turns to see Kate Shes tired scared but determined

JACK
Kate you showed me where the smoke was
I can get there myself--

KATE
Im coming with you

JACK KATE
I want you to stay here -- No

JACK
We dont know what the terrains gonna
be Youre safer if you--

KATE
I cant prove to you that Im up for it
All I can say is my gym had a rock
climbing wall -- and yeah I realize how
pathetic that sounds
(then firm but simple)
Im going with you

Jack wont argue Truth is he wants the company Then

JACK
Youre gonna need better shoes

68 ANGLE - KATE 68

Near the crash shes doing the bleak work of pulling boots
off a DEAD BODY She puts them on They fit A severe but
necessary move And she looks up -- far across the beach
LOCKE is watching her A somewhat intense gaze And Kate
thinks for a moment Did Locke know the woman whose shoes
Im now wearing But in the middle of that question Locke
SMILES -- AND REVEALS AN ORANGE PEEL COVERING HIS TEETH

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Somehow this moment just gives Kate the chills And Locke
turns away from her continuing to PEEL THE ORANGE that hes
eating

ANGLE - 15 SURVIVORS

Sitting together Among them are Boone and Shannon Sayid
Charlie Michael and Walt

CHARLIE
-- Anyone have any sunscreen

SHANNON
(going for her backpack)

She grabs it back as Jack arrives

JACK

And Charlie actually goes first Jack and Kate share a look

-- and the two head off after him

EXT JUNGLE - THE HIKE - MORNING - LATER 70
Jack cuts a SWATH through the jungle with a large STICK

forging a path of sorts A man of few words hes about ten

yards ahead of --

KATE and CHARLIE Walking in silence for a beat Then

KATE

You mind if I ask you something
CHARLIE

As he walks Charlie looks back at her somehow impressed by

Charlie like hes nuts

CHARLIE
-- You dont have to keep using the past
tense you know Were still together
(as they hike)
In fact Im supposed to be in the middle
of a comeback So

And they continue into the jungle and now were on a WIDE
SHOT of the three of them on their trek -- and we begin to
BOOM DOWN and realize its actually a POV

REVERSE ANGLE 71

Through the overgrown bushes -- somethings watching them
Its the WHITE LAB from the opening

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 72
TIGHTER as they enter another area of jungle And

suddenly THE SKY DARKENS Day to GRAY in seconds --
Charlie looks up at the sky -- WIND picks up ELECTRICITY

crackles in the air -- the three stop
CHARLIE
This -- is this normal

SUDDENLY ITS POURING SHEETS OF RAIN FUCKING TORRENTIAL
Jack Kate Charlie -- all SOAKED instantly -- and they pick
up their pace hurrying off as we CUT TO

EXT BASE CAMP - CRASH SITE - RAINSTORM - DAY 73
The rain pouring down -- VARIOUS SHOTS of the Survivors
scrambling

The Korean couple (SUN and JIN) huddle with half a dozen
other survivors under a piece of FUSELAGE DEBRIS -- when
another Survivor runs over Jin YELLS at them in Korean over
the DIN of the rain pointing

JIN
(in KOREAN)
Theres no more room here Over there
Theres room over there

And that Survivor is turned away running past Michael who
covers his son Walt with a too-large raincoat

Shannon and Boone head toward the wrecked plane -- stopped by
Hurley who yells to them over the NOISE

HURLEY
Im telling you you dont wanna go in
there Too many bodies

So Shannon and Boone head for shelter of some nearby trees
And Locke -- odd Locke -- who sits near the shore eyes
closed head back Letting the rain fall onto his face
Washing clean all thats come before

And theres Sayid being smart he sets up a TARP hes found

in cargo -- using aluminum sticks of wreckage as supports
And as soon as its up Sawyer enters --

into the deep valley -- MOVING -- and we PAN FAST -- were

UNDER DEBRIS SHELTER -- TIGHT ON CLAIRES FACE as she says --

CLAIRE
-- Look -- oh God look out there --

EXT JUNGLE - RAINSTORM - DAY 75

As the rain POUNDS we find Jack Kate and Charlie
continuing their hike They finally stop Their eyes
falling upon something -- and we PAN TO SEE IT

Its the COCKPIT Actually the entire front SECTION OF THE
PLANE smashed badly UPENDED resting against a giant tree
The characters take it in for a moment A horrible sight
And as they exchange a look ready for anything

EXT JUNGLE - RAINSTORM - DAY 76

BOOM DOWN over the massive piece of fuselage as Jack Kate
and Charlie arrive looking up at the terrifying debris Our
TRIO moves around the WRECKAGE twisted metal offering no
obvious way in Kate SPOTS something

KATE
(shouts over the rain)
OVER HERE

Jack and Charlie come to Kate who indicates a JAGGED OPENING
AT GROUND LEVEL -- enter-able but TIGHT Kate gets on her
stomach and CRAWLS into --

INT FRONT SECTION OF THE PLANE - RAINSTORM - DAY 77

Kate stands up to find herself -- inside the front section of
the plane Everything eerily CANTED all of FIRST CLASS and
the FRONT LAVATORIES between her and the COCKPIT OVERHEAD
BINS hanging open the aisles themselves on an ANGLE -- RAIN
leaking in -- half a dozen BODIES still in their chairs

Jack emerges from the opening -- Sees Kate is uneasy --
CHARLIE
Lets find your transgizmo and get outta

here yeah

Jack starts to move up the aisle -- fighting GRAVITY -- has
to grab onto the SEATS so he doesnt fall

Kate follows him THE SOUND OF THE RAIN still pounding on the
shattered hull Goes without being said --

This is all pretty fucking SCARY

Charlie then crawls through Stands Looks up toward the
cockpit Takes it all in --

CHARLIE (CONTD)

He starts climbing behind them

INT FRONT SECTION OF THE PLANE - COCKPIT DOOR - RAINSTORM
CONTINUOUS

Jack reaches the COCKPIT DOOR Battered by the crash --
slightly ajar but still LOCKED Jack reaches in -- TUGS on
the door But it wont open Jack grabs a CHARRED FIRE
EXTINGUISHER

JACK
(to Kate)
-- Get back

And Jack SLAMS the extinguisher down on the DOOR KNOB
Dents but nothing SLAMS it down again -- the lock BREAKS a
little -- but itll take some more SLAMS --

JACK (CONTD)
(HITTING IT with all his MIGHT)
Come on-- come on-- COME ON

BANG The knob BREAKS off And Jack drops the extinguisher
-- RIPS OPEN THE DOOR AND THE COPILOTS BODY FALLS OUT

Kate SCREAMS -- Jack SHOUTS -- and the body lands RIGHT NEAR
CHARLIE JUST AS HES CLIMBING INTO THE FRONT SECTION AND HE
SCREAMS --

INT FRONT SECTION OF THE PLANE - COCKPIT - RAINSTORM
CONTINUOUS
Rain pours through one of the shattered windows -- though

TREE BRANCHES and LEAVES obscures any view The other
windows are intact but thick with humidity Branches and
leaves also obscure any view to the outside The instrument
panel broken -- some pieces HANGING -- WIRES EXPOSED

And the PILOTs body is here slumped in his seat Jack
turns back to Kate who is about to climb up -- but she sees
the Pilots body

JACK
(protectively)
-- You dont have to come up here--

KATE
-- No Im good

So Jack helps pull up Kate As he starts searching
compartments

KATE (CONTD)
-- So what does a transceiver look like

JACK
-- Like a complicated walkie talkie

Kate starts looking for it too In order to check the
Pilots compartment she has to pull him back off the
controls So does back into his seat and SUDDENLY THE PILOT
JOLTS AWAKE -- KATE GASPS and Jack shocked moves to him --
the Pilot COUGHS disoriented and hurt Jack unbuckles his

straps -- checks his vitals --
JACK (CONTD) PILOT
-- Hey -- can you hear me (dazed weak)
(to Kate) -- What -- wh --

-- I need the water --

Kate quickly goes through the backpack as Jack undoes the

Pilots tie loosens his collar -- Kate hands the water to
Jack who gives it to the Pilot -- he drinks a little coughs
some up A dried cut on the mans forehead -- his eye

closed Although a pro the Pilot is on the verge of tears

PILOT
-- How many -- survived

JACK
At least forty-eight Including you

-- Anything feel broken

The Pilot slowly painfully begins to move -- but

PILOT
Head hurts -- dizzy

JACK
Probably a concussion

PILOT
-- How long has it been

JACK
Sixteen hours

PILOT
-- Sixteen
(then afraid)
-- Has anyone come

JACK
Not yet

Jack and Kate watch as the Pilot closes his eyes almost in
pain at the thought Finally his voice weak

PILOT
Six hours in Our radio went out The
redundant system the transponder --

wasnt functioning No one could see us
(then with dread)

So we turned back To land in Fiji
(dear God)

When we hit that turbulence we were

over a thousand miles off course --

Theyll be looking in the wrong place

Kate looks to Jack -- this is even worse news than he
anticipated

PILOT (CONTD)
We have a transceiver--

JACK
-- Good thats what we were hoping --
And the Pilot tries to stand -- its hard hes so bruised --

JACK (CONTD)
You shouldnt try to

PILOT
(getting his bearings now)

Transceivers in there

Kate goes for a compartment -- and pulls out a DAMAGED RADIO
She hands it to the Pilot He starts to work it -- when Jack
realizes

JACK

-- Wheres Charlie

Good question Kate moves back out of the cockpit The
Pilot keeps trying to radio -- but

PILOT
-- Its not working

INT FRONT SECTION OF THE PLANE - RAINSTORM - CONTINUOUS
Kate peeks in -- but Charlies nowhere to be seen Played as
an eerie moment but then she sees the door to one of the

FRONT LAVS is ajar Hears something INSIDE

Kate climbs back -- peers into the inverted bathroom where
Charlies leaning over the toilet bowl --

KATE
-- Hey whatre you d--

Charlie jumps -- nervous -- turns to her -- we HOLD ON

PILOT

-- Whats righ --

JACK
Shh

-- Whatever it is its RIGHT THERE -- stepping now outside
the cockpit -- theyre motionless as theres ANOTHER STEP --
the WIRES in the cockpit SHAKE with the apparent FOOT
IMPACT -- and a DARK SHAPE CROSSES the window --

Jack SLOWLY climbs up -- on one of the pilot seats -- and he
uses his hand -- wipes away some of the humidity on the
window in order to look outside -- but theres no way to see
a thing out there

So the Pilot
covered with

gets up -- moves toward the broken window
LEAVES and BRANCHES --

JACK (CONTD)
I wouldnt do that

PILOT
Good to know

And the Pilot puts the transceiver down on his seat as he
pushes away the LEAVES and BRANCHES and PEEKS HIS HEAD OUT
THE SHATTERED WINDOW

Jack and Kate watch terrified for a moment Then quietly

KATE
--DO you s-—-

KATE 87

Still running up ahead -- CRYING as she runs through the
rain -- almost losing her footing but not -- distant SCREAMS
OVERWHELMED by a THUNDERCLAP and Kate SCREAMS as she runs

KATE
JACK

But when the THUNDER stops the screaming is gone -- and Kate
runs and runs and finally SLIPS -- FALLS HARD -- scrambles to
her feet and takes SHELTER inside

EXT TREE TRUNK - RAINSTORM - CONTINUOUS 88

FOOT-TALL TREE She waits there and waits TERRIFIED
and we just HOLD ON HER AND HOLD until she SCREAMS OUT -

KATE
JAAABAACK 11
-- But theres nothing -- no one -- and she waits her eyes
GLUED TO THE DIRECTION THEY JUST CAME FROM she breathes
heavily waiting and WE HOLD ON HER FOR ALMOST A MINUTE
And as soon as we get so close we couldnt possibly get any
closer -- she whispers to herself terrified

ACT FOUR

FADE IN

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 89

Kate is exactly where we left her tucked amongst the roots
of the alien tree Rain pouring down around her Dark in
here Shes scared to death Were with her CLOSE

And she hears a SOUND over the rain -- something moving
towards her -- and she turns around -- looking behind her
now petrified

Nothing there Her eyes wide blinking in the rain Nothing
but jungle

She then turns back -- AND CHARLIE IS STANDING RIGHT THERE --
and it scares her so much she SCREAMS AND GRABS HIM --
PUSHING -- AND THEY FALL OVER onto his back her lying on top
of him in the mud --

KATE CHARLIE
WHERE THE HELLS JACK -- I dont know
-- Did you see him -- Yes He helped me up--
-- So where is he -- I dont know where he--
-- HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW -- WE GOT SEPARATED

-- and Kate stops long enough for Charlie to say

CHARLIE
-- he pulled me up If he hadnt that
th--

KATE
-- Did you see it

CHARLIE
No No But it was right behind us We
were dead -- I was Until Jack came back
for me

And just then something remarkable happens The rain stops
As abruptly as it started its gone They both look back
the way they came -- Kate looking up Charlie still on his
back craning his head

KATE
We have to go back for him
CHARLIE
Goback There Love -- listen --

theres a certain gargantuan quality
to whatever the hell that thing is --

Shes already getting up

KATE
-- Then dont come

And she goes off after Jack Pissed and nervous Charlie
finally goes after her

EXT JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER

DOLLY OUT OF THE THICK FOLIAGE to find Kate and Charlie
walking slowly through the dripping-wet jungle back the way
they came Theyre edgy and were moving with them The
DRIPPING SOUNDS somehow unnerving

Then Kate sees something up ahead Something GLISTENING in
the mud -- and she moves for it Charlie behind her

And she gets to it -- kneels -- its a scattered collection
of COINS And among them something she picks up

A PILOTS WINGS PIN

And Kate stares at the pin horrified because she senses
whats coming next She SLOWLY LOOKS UP And sees something
horrific Charlie looks up too His mouth opens in shock

CHARLIE
--What the hells that

Then a welcome voice

JACK (0S)
Its the pilot
And they turn around -- grateful to see Jack approaching from
the jungle -- Kate moves to him scared --
KATE

-- Did you see it
JACK
No It was right behind me I dove into
the bushes
Charlies eyes have gone back to the tree
CHARLIE

--Excuse me people but how the
hell does something like that happen

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

And they all look up again and we FOLLOW THEIR GAZE to
reveal that stuck up in a branch at least thirty-five feet
above ground -- IS THE BLOODY TORN BODY OF THE PILOT Dead
now for sure

EXT BEACH - DAY 91

SHANNON wearing a BIKINI now lying near the surf Of all
things shes SUNBATHING And the glorious sun is doing its
job -- and its a damn Coppertone commercial -- except as the
camera SLOWLY DOLLIES the huge PLANE WRECK is revealed in
the distance

And we can see in the background the Survivors are going
through luggage doing work to get a fire burning again
laying clothing out to dry

And after a beat Boone walks over looking down at his
vacationing sister

BOONE
Hey were going through the clothes
Sorting them
(beat judgemental)
I see you found your bag
(beat)
You wanna give us a hand

SHANNON
(doesnt even look)
Not really

Boone just stares at her absolutely despising her But all
he does is turn and walk off HOLD ON SHANNON for a
beatuntil we HEAR

CLAIRE (0S)
Is that your boyfriend

And Shannon looks over Claire sits twenty some feet away
Shannons far nicer to Claire than Boone

EXT BEACH - SURF LINE - DAY

At the surf line Jin our Korean HUSBAND his pants rolled
up intensely picks SEA URCHINS from the water placing them
in a PLASTIC BAG hes taken from the plane Its an oddly
serene image

And then we have a REVERSE VIEW -- from the ocean inland --
and Sun Jins wife sits on the sand Sitting straight
backed rather stoic Watching her husband The TOP BUTTON
of her blouse undone

Then were TIGHT on Suns face as she watches him his back
to her and though theres no dialogue here there doesnt
need to be Because her gaze is distinctly unsettled

MICHAEL (0S)
Excuse me

And Sun looks up Michael stands there

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Have you seen my boy

Sun just looks at Michael for a long beat Finally she
speaks in her native language

SUN
(in KOREAN)
My apologies but I do not speak
English

And Michael stands there for a moment confused And Michael
looks up and sees that mid-reach into the sea Jin has
stopped working looking back at her wife and this strange
man Which should tell us immediately how controlling Jin
really is Then Jin calls out

scanning the jungle Then he sees something and he walks
toward it -- and we FOLLOW HIM over his shoulder BOOMING UP

floor He picks it up

ITS A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS

It’s dual-band Military spec
Broadcasts full-range far as I can tell
Chances are the battery is good but the
radio it is dead

KATE
-- Can you get it to work

SAYID
(stares at it feels pressure)
I need some time

Kate nods -- Sayid walks off -- just as Rose moves to Jack
saying quietly

EXT LAGOON - DAY 104

LONG LENS CLOSE ON KATE standing alone in a lagoon out of
sight of the others Her duffel bag on the shore she wears
only her underwear and tank-top in the water cleaning
herself off using a shirt as washcloth

As she does this she CRIES Letting out all of the emotion
that’s been building We HOLD on her This moment a
catharsis for us as well

And we HOLD on her long enough to see her pull it together
Finding her strength again Staring off knowing that
somehow she has to keep moving forward

SUN (0OS)
(in KOREAN)
-- Excuse me --

-- And Kate turns to see Sun standing there -- and Sun is
slightly embarrassed as she points back toward the wreckage

SUN (CONTD)
(in KOREAN)

-- I believe they are finished They

need you

And Sun moves away
EXT BEACH - DAY 105

Kate returns dressed now -- as Sayid finishes wrapping the
radio in black electrical tape

KATE
-- Is it working

SAYID
Seems to be -- except we’re not picking
up a signal

KATE
-- Why would we need to pick up a signal
aren’t we sending one --

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

SAYID

-- Yes but it’s a “transceiver” -- it
transmits and receives Which means you
can also read the level of other signals
that you are picking up

(shows her)
What you want is to see little bars
Right here

And Sayid shows her where RECEPTION BARS would normally be

Currently

there are none

SAYID (CONTD)
The little bars would show that the radio
is getting reception Meaning we’d be in
range of another radio There are no
bars here

KATE
--SO the radio’s worthless

SAYID
-- We could broadcast blind Hope that
someone maybe a ship somewhere picks

up our distress call But that would be
a waste of the battery Which might not
last for long

KATE
We need the bars

SAYID
We need the bars
(then with a thought)
It is unlikely but perhaps worth a try

KATE
-- What

SAYID
Sending a signal from high ground

KATE
(uh-oh)
-How high

And Sayid’s eyes flick over Kate’s shoulder as

breaths As Jack delicately looks at the wound --

KATE
How is he

Jack glances over his shoulder sees Kate Eyes go back to
Shrapnel Man Shakes his head not good And she asks
caring nervous for the Man

KATE (CONTD)
»Can you do anything

JACK
I can pull out the shrapnel

KATE
But yesterday you said --

JACK

-- I know But that was yesterday

(then)
I was hoping he’d be at a hospital by
now

(beat)
We leave him like this he’1ll be dead
within a day If I open him up and if
I can control the bleeding and if he
doesn’t go into sepsis -- and if I can
find some antibiotics he might be all

right But there’s no way of knowing
until I see what kind of damage there is

in there
(sees she’s freaked a morose
joke)

Hey -- at least he’s unconscious

almost see her make a decision Then --

-- No --
-- There’s not time -- we -- Kate --

obviously need to send out a
signal sooner than later --

-- Hold on a second -- you
-- Yes I did what makes you Saw what that thing did to
think you’re any safer on the the pilot --
beach than you are in the
jungle

Well That’s logic that even Jack can’t argue with He
looks at Shrapnel man knowing he has to stay --

Wait for me I don’t know how long
this’ll take --

At the shore Sun kneels on the sand cutting the sea
urchins for food prep on a large ROCK Jin stands beside
her holding an airplane FOOD TRAY collecting the cut
pieces

Once shes done Jin takes the newly-cut pieces and adds them
to the tray

Sun reaches to take one of the pieces off the rock -- clearly
just trying to help -- but Jin actually slaps her hand
putting the piece onto the tray himself She reacts --
obedient and accepting as Jin walks off with the tray TIGHT
ON SUN as she watches him go

And in a private moment of defiance -- her eyes holding on
her husband as he walks off -- SHE UNDOES THE TOP BUTTON OF
HER BLOUSE

A WIDE SHOT of the image -- the complicated couple with their
culturally-formed dynamic framed majestically by the
incredible tropical terrain

I understand why you and the doctor
decided not to frighten us but your

Sawyer watches them go as he sits on part of the shattered
wing near the remains of one of the enormous engines Hes
taking final drags on a cig In general a fuck em all
attitude

After a beat something weighing on his mind he pulls his
wallet from a back pocket Opens it Pulls out a folded
piece of paper Unfolds it

TIGHT on Sawyers face as he re-reads the page

And slowly his face changes His eyes awash in concern
and more surprisingly vulnerability He just stares at the

mysterious letter his eyes actually WELLING UP with what
he reads
Finally quickly he re-folds it -- puts it back in his

wallet more anxious and troubled than weve seen him

He finishes the cigarette and puts it out on the damn
airplane that brought him here

He gets up and moves off quickly after the others

A long beat of silence Finally Locke asks without ever
looking up

LOCKE
Do you play

A beat

WALT
Nope
(long beat)
What is it Is it like Checkers

As odd as Locke seemed around the adults he almost seems
normal now A bizarre child-like honesty that makes him
accessible to Walt

LOCKE
Not really
(looks up)
Its a better game than Checkers

And after a beat Walt moves closer to Locke Watches

LOCKE (CONTD)
Do you play checkers with your pop

WALT
(long beat)
No
(beat)
I was in Australia with my mom

LOCKE
You have no accent

WALT
Yeah we move a lot
(beat)
She got sick She died So

Locke looks at the kid You sorta wish he werent

LOCKE
Youre having a rough month

Matter of fact Not talking down to the kid And Walt
appreciates that Locke turns his attention back to the
board Slowly and gently continues to set up the board
pushing the small black and white tiles onto their starting
points The effect is almost mesmerizing --

LOCKE (CONTD)
Backgammon is the oldest game in the
world Much older than chess
Archaeologists found sets when they
excavated the ruins of Ancient
Mesopotamia Would you like to guess how
old they were

WALT
A hundred years

LOCKE
Five thousand years

WALT
(whispers to himself)
Five thousand

LOCKE
-Thats older than Jesus Christ

Which doesnt really land for Walt But he asks

WALT
Did they have dice and stuff
LOCKE
Yes But theirs werent made of plastic
(then)
Their dice were made of bones
WALT
(slightly nervous)

Cool

Walt watches carefully as Locke picks up one WHITE piece and
one BLACK one Folds them into his CLASPED hands and gently
shakes

LOCKE
The Persians called it Takhteh Nard
which means Battle on Wood Two
players Two sides One is light One
is dark

Locke extends his closed fists offering them to Walt Walt
considers deliberates Then taps his finger on Lockes
right hand He slowly opens one We dont get to see it but
Walt does And now that distracted creepy grin is back

Sayid begins to SCAN for the frequency -- nothing but STATIC

Its a counter -- the next number will

Beat Then the FRENCH WOMAN begins again still FAINTER -
Sayid looks up at the others triumphant

SAWYER

times the message has repeated Its
roughly thirty seconds long so

KATE
Let her listen

FEMALE VOICE (VO)
Il les a tues I1 les a tues tous

And Shannons face FALLS as she listens something
registering and whatever it is it scares the LIVING SHIT
OUT OF HER

CHARLIE

The voice gets fainter and fainter Shannon brings the
walkie to her ear shes calm now almost as if shes

CHANNELING the speaker And yeah -- its fucking SPOOKY
SHANNON
Please help Im alone now on the

island alone Someone please come the

others theyre dead It killed them
(then)

It killed them all

And with that complete and utter SILENCE The battery is
dead Just the wind Then Shannon lowers the transceiver

We suddenly find SAYID His lips stop moving His eyes drop
from the heavens And he looks even more frightened than the
rest of them

SAYID
Sixteen years

SAWYER

SAYID
Sixteen years Five months And nine
days Thats the count

CHARLIE BOONE
