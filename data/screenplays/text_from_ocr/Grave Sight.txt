DESERT - MOONLIT NIGHT
A muted landscape Vague Mysterious Still

Abruptly invaded by bouncing blinding headlights -- evicting
jackrabbits and other night creatures past prickly phantoms

OVERSIZE TIRES

skid to a dusty halt

A strange hourglass-shaped SHADOW in snakeskin cowboy boots
pursues a flashlight beam toward the rear of the offroad

vehicle where exhaust chugs

A Land of Enchantment vanity plate OBSEQUY rises as the
Shadow lifts Something out of the vehicle

DESERT DWELLERS

freeze in anticipation gauging the beam probing toward them
then suddenly turn into a kaleidoscope of SCURRYING spiny
shadows punctuated by a

VENOMOUS RATTLE

as a Diamondback coils -- strikes at the staggering boots
Something in a plastic garbage bag drops to the sand
with the flashlight

DANCING BOOTS

tow the impaled rattler with them

Finally one boot traps the slithering snake behind the head
The other jerks away from the pumping fangs

A DOUBLE-EDGED KNIFE

glints in the light as it decapitates the rattlesnake
Its headless body thrashes against itself in futile flight

The desert audience scatters
THE SHADOW

picks up the flashlight and the garbage bag
Beam focuses on the desert floor leading slowly toward

A DEEP DRY ARROYO

where the garbage bag drops One boot kicks the bag
Rolling it past the beam into the darkness
SKY - DAWN
Buzzards circle high above
JORNADA DEL MUERTO DESERT - DAWN

A spiny mesquite tree with outstretched limbs the transient
home to several Buzzards

Waiting Patiently watching
THE PLASTIC GARBAGE BAG

containing Something lifeless at the bottom of the deep
dry arroyo

JORNADA DEL MUERTO DESERT —- DAY

One of the Buzzards blinks his eyes cranes up at the noonday
sun and decides to fuck patience IMPATIENT hopflies over
to the garbage bag and plucks at it with his beak

The others watch with dispassionate interest until he strikes
through the plastic coming up with flesh and blood

All the Buzzards wade in clawing and pecking

Suddenly blood curdling SCREAMS from Something inside the
garbage bag sends the buzzards scattering

SOMETHING

moves tears at the plastic coffin from inside -- desperately
trying to get out

A NAKED WOMAN
emerges gasping for breath Battered Bloody Barely alive

EarlyMidLate-20s-30s Hard to tell
Her opalescent throat and wrists collared with glowy welts

This beautiful headturner squints at the horde of buzzards
Impatient stares back
JORNADO DEL MUERTO DESERT ARROYO - LATER

Womans blood-shot eyes close Impatient moves in pecks
testingly at her foot -- No reaction

Encouraged he goes for another piece Her bruised ribs
shudder She yelps in pain and tries to kick him away

Impatient backs off just out of reach
The Woman stretches out her hand painfully frantically
searching for a rock a stick anything

Mustering what remaining strength she has to throw several
impotent pebbles at the impatient vulture

Finally she lands one on his featherless head -- Impatient
backs off humiliated joins his smirking peers to wait

WOMAN

takes a deep halting breath grits her teeth sits up
Okay so far so good
She tries to stand No good

BUZZARDS
watch as she uses her teeth to rip the plastic bag
JORNADA DEL MUERTO DESERT - DUSK

The Woman scratches her way up the side of the arroyo on
plastic-wrapped hands and knees

On her left buttock an extraordinary tattoo An ancient
Mimbres design of a gimlet-green swan with a long neck and
the head of a horned serpent Fangs bared a lightning-bolt
forked-tongue probing between her firm cheeks

Finally clawing her way to the top she rests for a moment
looks around for a protected spot there isnt one

Just barren prairie desert as far as she can see

She takes a final look at the Buzzards

WOMAN
(hoarse whisper)
Find another link in your fucking
food chain

They hopfly away She crawls toward the setting sun

the sheet from the half-eaten-away face of a TEENAGE GIRL

The Chickasaw Couple still recognize her cling to each other

sprawled out before them on the steps

A small caliber revolver and gunnysack in the mans
outstretched hands

Frank and Bill approach cautiously their weapons leveled at
the body

Frank kicks the revolver away
Bill checks the carotid artery no pulse

They holster their weapons as a couple of Uniforms quickly
maintain control over the gathering crowd

INT MAXWELL MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY - UNM - NIGHT

In the twostory gallery reconstruction of an ancient Anasazi
kiva at Chaco Canyon -- Archeology Professors DIANE BRODY
PhD Director of the Maxwell Museum and DWAYNE HILL-RUNNER
PhD co-curators of the Buried in the Past The Enigma of
Mimbres Painted Pottery exhibit painstakingly examine the
pottery from the gunnysack
PROFESSOR BRODY

All evidence of the Mimbres virtually
vanished from the archeological record
around 1150

(reverently displays

bowl to Bill)
This black-on-white bowl survived
because they buried it beneath the
floor of a house with their dead

BILL
(defensive)
The hole was already in it when I
took it out of the sack

DR HILL-RUNNER
Usually the bottom of the bowl was
punched out ‘killed before it was
placed over the head of the corpse

BILL
Killed

PROFESSOR BRODY
Some in the community speculate that
these so-called kill holes were
meant to release the spirit of the
bowl when it was buried with its owner
The reality is these bowls represent
a vocabulary that has been lost It
is unlikely their real purpose will
ever be known

AGENT JICARILLA
(approaching)
They were meant to stay in the ground
meant to go on their journey Instead
theyve been desecrated by white hands
put on exhibit where all the life is
sucked out of them

PROFESSOR BRODY
Thats just wrong Agent Jicarilla
By exhibiting their artifacts we honor
the memory of these ancient people
We in essence bring them back to life

AGENT JICARILLA
If you really feel that way Professor
why dont you dig up one of your own
ancestors graves put them on display

PROFESSOR BRODY
Would that I could but you know
the law as well as I do

INT MAXWELL MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY - UNM - LATER

Bill and Agent Jicarilla walk through a cave setting with
artwork of recent ancestors reproduced on the walls in red

JORNADA DEL MUERTO DESERT - SUNRISE

Dunes Dunes Dunes

The Woman sleeps under a blanket of white gypsum sand directly
in the whirlingswirling path of a Dust Devil that pirouettes
over her then continues on its random course

Leaving the Woman sputtering for air

She brushes her face spits sand out of her bruised mouth

WOMAN
Thats one hell of a wakeup call

She gathers herself squints into rising sun staggers on
A DIAMONDBACK

Slithers between some rocks seeking relief from its sloughing
skin

Suddenly a rock splatters the rattlesnakes head flat

The Woman squats on her haunches and watches calmly almost
serenely until spasms and death RATTLE stop

The Woman approaches cautiously reaches for the snake
-- it convulses in her hands --

She screams drops the snake and scampers away

SKY - DAY

A lone Buzzard circles above

WOMAN

Squints up at the Buzzard then her gaze drifts back to the
crushed snake almost as if the bird reminded her

The Buzzard and the Woman move at the same time --
The Buzzard swoops down --

The Woman grabs the carcass just in time

FRUSTRATED BUZZARD
lands on a nearby mesquite tree
The Woman crouches in a cluster of rocks with petroglyphs
They eye each other for a moment
She recognizes Impatient
Then with a strange sense of pride and glee
The Woman ravenously bites into the impotent snake
Spitting out the skin with a primal guttural laugh

Relishing the moist meat and the cool blood

Disconcerted Impatient studies this primordial Woman
devouring the spoils of the hunt

Laughing naked bloody triumphant

Then with a slight bow from his bald head
Impatient gathers himself and hopflies into the sky

WOMAN
holds the remains of the snake in her outstretched arms

She watches Impatient climb until he spreads his majestic
wings catches a thermal and glides away

Then sliding down into a separation between the illustrated
rocks she licks her lips in satisfaction and spreads the
snakes skin over her body

THUNDER CRACKS somewhere in the distance

SKY - NIGHT

Violent lightning backlights quickly gathering thunderheads
JORNADA DEL MUERTO DESERT - NIGHT

THUNDER CRACKS

The Woman stands in the cloudburst head stretched up mouth
open wide taking in the liquid manna

LOW RUMBLING builds in the distance

She looks at the turbulent light show reading the clouds
then suddenly gets a knowing panicked look

FLASH FLOOD

Surges through the desert floor collecting rocks shrubs
animals -- anything unfortunate enough to get in its way

WOMAN
Wedges between two boulders turns her back on the coming
deluge Like molten lava the flash flood envelopes the
rocks and the Woman in its opaque path

For several anxious moments the Woman disappears

Then we glimpse her -- swept along fighting her way to the
surface catching a gasp of air towed below again

Then as suddenly as it came the flash flood passes --
Leaving in its wake

BOULDERS
covered with gray-brown silt For a while nothing moves
Finally a hand appears as the Woman painfully claws her way
out Covered in silt like a grainy body-stocking
She glares at the Moon
WOMAN

Whats the matter Mother Moon Was

I having too good a time
Woman climbs up on a large boulder sits checks her bearings
SKY
a few minor and major points of light but no Orion
WOMAN
picks a delirious direction at random staggers on

JORNADA DEL MUERTO DESERT - PRE-DAWN

In the red morning glow the Woman stumbles falling across
a small depression

Her tattered fingers reach out trace the impression of
several wide tires

Encouraged she crawls along them

Abruptly she stops in the tracks stares at something ahead
ENCHANTED GARDEN - WOMANS POV

Floating on a small misty lake

An oasis of pastel green and blue surrounded by marble columns
with some sort of pennant fluttering in the cool fog

WOMAN

crawls on strength rapidly failing hypnotically drawn toward
her pastoral vision

OASIS

The Woman collapses into the deep green embracing it hands
outstretched toward the cool blue

EXT DESERT - CHACO CANYON ANCIENT RUINS - MOONLIT NIGHT

A muted landscape Primordial structures stand pitted against
the elements on a lonely bluff overlooking Chaco Canyon

Abruptly invaded by bouncing blinding headlights --
jackrabbit bolts across the beams --

INT JEEP - MOVING

The Man jerks the steering wheel Gaby takes advantage of
the moment She kicks the 4-wheel shift-lever into low

The gears GRIND -- noisily attempting to lock up
The Man struggles for control
The double-edged knife CLATTERS to the floorboards

OVERSIZE TIRES twist skid to a dusty halt
Leave the ground

DESERT DWELLERS eyes measure the headlight beams
somersaulting over them

GABY AND THE MAN SCREAM

JEEP tumbles -- finally comes to a jary rest on its side
EXT HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT

TWO SILHOUETTES run toward a LIFEGUARD helicopter

EXT DESERT - OVERTURNED JEEP - NIGHT

OVERSIZE TIRES spin impotently

GASOLINE drips from ruptured auxiliary tanks

HISSING as it hits the CHUGGING exhaust

A moment then the ENGINE abruptly DIES

EXT HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT

Turning blades of a helicopter silhouetted against the red-
moonlit sky REV-UP

EXT DESERT - OVERTURNED JEEP - NIGHT
TIRES slowly stop turning

A still moment then one stiletto-heeled boot hits the sand
Gaby shakily limps through the stacked headlight beams
Double-edged knife dangling from one hand toward the
opposite side of Jeep where the Man lies stunned

Gaby pulls Tassels 38 out of the Mans belt sinks down
straddling his head his heaving shoulders pinned between
her knees Gaby holds the revolver to his throat

She tears off the hairpiece -- Revealing Roy Elgins bald
head Roys eyes snap open he starts to say something

GABY
(knife blade to lips)
Shhhh

She presses the stubby barrel under his chin --
Roy holds his breath Gaby hesitates

ROY
(whispers )

GABY
Deciding
ROY
(panicking)

I smell gas
EXT HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT
Silhouetted helicopter lifts off
EXT DESERT - OVERTURNED JEEP - NIGHT

Gaby lets him up Roy carefully backs away from the 38 to
the end of the stacked headlight beams

GABY

ROY
If you can do it Just do it Im
tired of your theatrics
Gaby fires revolver sending a SHOT between his legs

EXT TWOLANE BLACKTOP - NIGHT

A red and white UNM Helicopter races along the white line at
cactus height

EXT DESERT - CHACO CANYON ANCIENT RUINS - GABY AND ROY

In the light of the stacked headlight beams Roy slowly and
sensually strips off his boots and bodysuit

His body sports deep chest piercings complete with jewelry
tubes in both nipples symbolic blackwork tattooing and --

A tortured little 20 waist constricted by a wide screw-on
locking belt -- An hourglass silhouette his arms akimbo

ROY
And the White Light said Behold I
am you and you are me

GABY
Quit trying to be Indian Roy you
dont have the soul for it You dont
have a clue about the true O-kee-pa

Nobody got me off the way she did

GABY
You offed her you piece of shit

ROY

The bitch knew everything She stole
a pair of earrings right out of an
open casket I know she was going
to turn me in

(beat)
Its a shame as much as I loved
domming her she loved subbing more

GABY
You sick bastard she didnt love

to say No Afraid to ask for
‘mercy She couldnt give consent

Roys down to a leather loincloth

ROY

GABY

Gaby levels the 38
ROY

(incredulous )

GABY
You shot me full of XTC hung me
until I went into coma dumped me in
the desert like some piece of dead
meat What do you call that

Roy recognizes the cold lethal look in Gabys eyes

ROY
A favor I gave you bliss I punched
you into a whole new level of being
Took your memory and gave you courage
to make changes in your life Whats
a little pain compared to that

GABY
You want pain I11l show you pain

Gaby stares at the tattoo on his stomach -- The jeweled handle
of a knife its double-edged blade disappearing into his
loincloth

GABY
I said shed everything

She cocks the gun Roy slinks out of his loincloth
Pierced genital jewelry glistens from his crotch

GABY
Youre into BodMod How about a
little subincision

ROY
What

GABY
I think Ill geld you first

Roy stumbles back into the desert darkness
Gaby moves after him gun and knife flashing in the light
Roy trips falls to the ground Gabys on him in a heartbeat
She presses one stiletto heel to his throat
Roy instinctively grabs his crotch
ROY
(a hoarse whisper)
I am as close to God as you will
ever be

Roys eyes close in anticipation as Gaby raises the knife

ROY
Take me now

Her blazing eyes look down at him as he slowly moves his
hands away from his crotch

Abruptly Gaby stops backs off

GABY
I cant do this this isnt me

Roys eyes bulge Perspiration flowing with the blood His
trembling fingers prod and pull at her boots

ROY
(sobbing)
No No Do it Please please
Gaby pulls her legs out of reach Roy crumbles into a foetal
ball She looks down at this worthless whimpering excuse of
a human being and walks away

(hysterical)
No No You cant do this You

GABY
Watch me

She picks up Roys clothes and carries them toward
OVERTURNED JEEP
as Gaby approaches the stream of gasoline ignites

She stops illuminated by the flames mesmerized triumphant
tosses Roys clothes into the flames

EXT CHACA CANYON ANCIENT RUINS - MOONLIT NIGHT

Roy crazed out of control creeps in and out of shadow
sneaks up behind Gaby a rock in his trembling hand
Glowing night eyes gauge the licking flames

Roy aims 38

Only to be interrupted by the singular sound of metal
lacerating flesh and bone

He coughs once and slowly turns to face Gaby standing behind
him with the bloody double-edged knife in her hand

Roy starts to say something blood bubbles up in his mouth
He crumbles to the desert floor like a rag doll

GABY

stumbles over to Gus

Kneels down beside him pulls off the wig drops it in Guss
lap

GABY
Did you kill her

watches Roy topple to the desert floor

Then searches for Gaby in the darkness

Gus impulsively touches the key around his neck underneath
his torn shirt as Gaby backs away into the darkness

EXT DESERT - CHACO CANYON ANCIENT RUINS - DAWN

From the flat red sea of sand rise great rock mesas resembling
vast cathedrals the desert the mountains and mesas all
continually reformed and recolored by the cloud shadows

BILL
Its like desecrating a church

Bills doubting eyes turn from this amazing vista toward the
pillaged Anasazi site where Agent Jicarilla pokes through
the smoldering remains of Roys Jeep

AGENT JICARILLA
A hiker tipped the Park Rangers to
digging here so they placed a seismic
sensor to monitor human activity
It activated last night

Several Park Rangers search the site in the bg

BILL
I knew my sister all her life I
know Roy Elgin twenty years I never
would have figured this

AGENT JICARILLA
You were too close to her and he had
the prefect cover He was in the
business of honoring the dead

Agent Jicarilla heads toward his BIA SUV where a Sheriffs
Helicopter and a UNM Lifeguard Helicopter wait for EMTs
to bandage Gus

FRANK

watches two Park Rangers slip Roy into a body bag lying
amongst shards of fragile archaic pottery

FRANK
(to Gus)
Ive never known a rich fuck yet who
wasnt kinky

Through the smoke in the bg Bill wanders through the vacant
structures on the lonely bluff overlooking Chaco Canyon

FRANK
(indicates Bill)
Give him a little time some prejudice
die hard He was so sure it was you

EMTs put Gus on a stretcher
Take him to the Helicopter

Frank tags

He finally breaks the chain and desperately draws in a deep
invigorating breath

But with the next breath Gus spots something through the
