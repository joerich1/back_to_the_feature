Forsythia shimmering in a spring rain its buds dropping
under the weight of the fresh water

featherless wings

And finally sunset in the woods New leaves are every-
where A rabbit crawls slowly out of its hole and
surveys the place

our friends Heres to us and
to whatever threads our marriages
hang by - let them be strong

veers off to the left Unfortunately Nick in trying
to avoid Jack goes in the same direction Jack is going
in They narrowly miss hitting each other Nick skids
around in a field and finally drops his cycle and jumps
away from it Jack manages to cut a wide arc and suddenly
realizes hes meeting Danny coming around from the other
direction They pass each other with inches to spare
both of them screaming at the top of their lungs Nick
rolls around on the ground laughing at the both of them
in a helpless giggle Finally Nick retrieves his motor-
cycle and moves down the road with Jack and Danny

As they travel Nicks chuckling at their expense begins
to get under the akin of Danny and Jack They trade
glances and move a little faster than Nick Nick catches
up with them They move a little faster Before long

The leaves dripping with water in the blue dawn

The swollen brook rushing past the barn and under the old

cUr TO
EXT SUMMER MONTAGE - DAY 26

‘The brook joins another brook This larger stream rushes

over rocks

Sunlight begins to play on the water as the stream
becomes a river then rapids

Full sunlight as a wave crashes against a shore
It is now summer

White beaches extend for miles The warm sun plays on
the green tufts that are the Virgin Islands

Pale green waters gently run their frothy fingers across
the velvet sand

Beneath the surface of the sea in a misty light a
black and yellow sergeant-major fish moves lazily past
the darting lavenders of the needle-nose

A sting-ray wafts its way across the bottom a pilot
fish never leaving its post just above the rays head
A giant turtle lumers gracefully through the water

The CAMERA TAKES ITS EYE OFF the turtle and RISES UP
through the water as if behind a swimming mask It
SLIDES THROUGH the surface of the ocean into open air
where WE SEE a sailboat bobbing gently at anchor near
a lush green island

KATE
Youre not concentrating Ill
tell you about a piece Im editing
on inflation Now pay attention
okay

JACK
Yeah

KATE
According to Lester C Thurow

at MIT part of the problem
is that the production of goods —

‘and services per man hour of

work is falling at a rate of 3
year

JACK
(trying to concentrate
Uh huh

KATE

So if productivity falls 3 then
wages have to fall 3 But if wages
dont fall 3 then the cost of
production rises because it

gs more hours of work to
Produce the same goods Are
you listening

JACK
Im listening Thats great
Keep going

KATE
So the extra costs of less
efficient production have to
be passed along to the consumer
inthe form of higher prices

from the other cabin are too much Unable
on trying to talk however

laughing)
So if productivity falls
