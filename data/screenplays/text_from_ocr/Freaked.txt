SEVENTH DRAFT

INT REGIS and KATHIE LEE SHOW SET

A horribly deformed figure--hunchback misshapen head--sits
on a stool in complete silhouette This is RICK COOGAN

RICK
Can you imagine it Regis Kathie
Lee One day Im a hot young
movie star and the next day Ima
hideous mutant freak covered with
festering lesions

Oddly REGIS and KATHIE LEE are also in complete silhouette
REGIS
Sounds like my wife when she misses

a mudpack

The audience CRACKS UP Kathie Lee pooh-poohs Regis

KATHIE LEE
Oh Regis Youre incorrigible Ha-
ha
(to Rick she turns

EARNEST)

Ricky once you were the all-
American boy next door star of the
beloved Hey Dude films Now the
very mention of your name makes
children scream in terror Weve
all read about your disturbing
story But the people want to hear
it from you Ricky Coogan

(SFX children scream)

Wont you tell us your story

RICK
Well its kinda long but okay
to

It all started when I signed a deal
to be spokesman for the EES
conglomerate

DISSOLVE TO

INT EES CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The EES logo--a large metal shoe with a bar across it
with the words Everything Except Shoes beneath Widen to
reveal RICHARD HERTZ president of EES smiling rigidly

camera RICK COOGAN is next to him also holding a stiff
movie-star smile FLASH They shake hands as the EES
photographer takes publicity shots Off to one side behind
Hertz are several EES EXECUTIVES Behind Rick is his
entourage LAWYER BODYGUARD TRAINER STYLIST and SPIRIT
GUIDE

Further off at the boardroom table four DODDERING OLD
CORPORATE FARTS on the brink of death look on with glazed
expressions

RICK
(through a clenched smile)
So what kind of crap do you
scumbags want me to peddle

HERTZ
Everything Everything except
shoes of course Hah hah

He laughs pathetically Rick doesnt respond Hertz nods to
a nearby EXECUTIVE who hands him some BEEF STICKS

HERTZ
Meaty Twig Beef Sticks

Rick takes them and holds them up to the camera Smiles
Flash

HERTZ
Helmet Head hair spray

He takes the hair spray and holds it up Smile Flash
The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal

container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it
Hertz gives it to Rick
HERTZ
Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro-
fertilizer

Rick holds it up then pushes it away in disgust

RICK
Fertilizer Ricky Coogan does not
do ads for hi-tech cow shit Ima
star got it Hertz
(to his aide)
Rico give these misguided clowns
Tony Danzas phone number and
lets get the hell out of here

He gives the finger to the EES photographer who obligingly
takes a picture Hertz waves at him to get lost and calls
after Rick whos headed to the door with his entourage

HERTZ
Rick Wait Only you can stand up
to the radicals trying to keep
Noxon from the struggling farmers

whose very future depends on it

RICK
(HESITATES)
Noxon Wasnt that just banned

HERTZ
Only in the USand Europe

RICK
But I heard that shits lethal

Hertz lets out a big laugh He shakes his head at Rick

HERTZ
Rick Rick Rick You want
proof Fine Just take a seat

Please

Rick nods to his entourage They sit at the boardroom table
across from the EES execs An easel behind Hertz shows a
placard with a bar graph Hertz whispers something to an
aide who scurries off

HERTZ
(TO RICK)
Meet the head of our South American
research facility Juan Valdez

The aide ushers in a handsome LATIN AMERICAN EXECUTIVE in a

natty three-piece suit and a sombrero

GEORGE
My name is George Ramirez

HERTZ
Whatever Hes worked with Noxon
24 every day for five years and
hes in fine shape Arent you
Juan

George glares at Hertz bitterly Hertz

GEORGE
Yes I am fine Me and my team in
Santa Flan have--

RICK
Santa Flan What kind of shitty
name for a country is that

GEORGE
It is named for the patron saint of
creamy desserts As I was

saying weve worked very closely
with Noxon

stares him down

Rick nods We cut back to George but he isnt George
anymore He has mutated into a similar looking actor in the
same suit the same sombrero but shorter and swarthier

GEORGE (CONTD)
I personally supervised its
development

Rick furrows his brow Hes a little suspicious of Georges

transformation but just a little

Now George is even shorter even swarthier Yet another

actor

GEORGE (CONTD)
I performed rigorous scientific
tests No potential danger was
left uninvestigated
down

Ricks suspicion is increasing He looks over to Hertz who
feigns total innocence

George is now even shorter Still another actor His
clothes are baggy and the sombrero is starting to slide

over his face

GEORGE (CONTD)
The environmentalists are
crackpots all of them

Rick looks at his entourage Their mouths hang open in
astonishment

George has now shrunk to near-midget proportions The
sombrero completely covers his head When he takes it off
we see hes now played by LINDA HUNT

GEORGE
Its ridiculous I tell you
Totally ridiculous

Rick is ready to ask questions but Hertz cuts him off

HERTZ
Thank you Valdez That will be
all

George nods and heads back to his seat As he passes behind
Hertz he cant resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and
making a face

RICK
Wait a second--

HERTZ
Ricky this is important Were
talking about a major threat to the
EES image How does 2 million
dollars plus expenses sound

The aide reveals a new placard on the easel It reads 2
MILLION

RICK
Look it sounds great but--

HERTZ
I hear you Make it five million--
(a new placard 5 MILLION)
that is if the board agrees

Hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever The old
geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly as if they were
being pulled by strands of fishing line which they are

HERTZ
Good its unanimous Well what
do you say Ricky Are you EESs
Man in Santa Flan

Rick looks at his advisors--they look over at Linda Hunt
then emphatically shake their heads NO Rick looks at
Hertz who shows him five big fingers and grins Rick breaks
into a big smile and gives Hertz his trademark thumbs up
sign

INT LA AIRPORT SECURITY CHECK

Rick stands in line at the luggage X-ray machine He
impatiently checks his watch as the X-RAY CHECKER chats him
up A CRAZED ANARCHIST holding a large bomb passes through
the security check unquestioned

X-RAY CHECKER
My kids just loved you in Hey Dude
Three The Final Countdown We
need more wholesome role models
like you

RICK
Uh-huh

(TO HIMSELF)
Where the fuck is Ernie

We hear WOMENS SCREAMS They turn towards the noise and see
a bunch of STEWARDESSES scattering from a trendy young cad
with a fake hand sticking out of his fly This is ERNIE
Ricks buddy and resident court jester

ERNIE
Ladies All I wanted was a
manicure Yah-ha-ha
(he sees Rick)
ITS THE CooG
RICK

WOOF

Rick pumps Ernies third hand The miffed X-ray checker
points to Ricks large carry-on bag as it emerges from the

Xe
ray machine
X-RAY CHECKER
(TO RICK)
Mister Coogan is this your bag
RICK
Yeah why
X-RAY CHECKER
Is this your kid
He indicates the X-ray monitor where we see the skeleton
outline of a BUCKTOOTHED BESPECTACLED 10 YEAR OLD KID
curled

up in Ricks bag The kid waves Rick and Ernie look at
each other in horror

RICKERNIE
Stuey Gluck

The bag bursts open and out pops STUEY GLUCK an obsessive
young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and
memorabilia

STUEY
Rick Rick Look I got a rare
still from your high school
production of The Glass Menagerie
Could you sign it for me

Please
RICK
NO
(TO ERNIE)
Lets get the hell out of here

Ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under Stuey They run
away down the corridor Stuey chases them holding up an 8
by 10 photo

STUEY
Rick Wait up
FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR

Rick and Ernie run around a corner with Stuey in pursuit

STUEY
Rick Remember the speech you gave
at the Actors Forum for Social
Justice

He holds up a cassette player and hits play Its Ricks old
speech

RICKS VOICE (FROM TAPE)

If all the world is a stage then
let us shine the spotlight on
truth integrity and a deep
compassion for all life

RICK
Leave me alone troll

(TO ERNIE)
That was before I got an
entertainment lawyer

ERNIE
Quick down here

Ernie leads Rick down an adjacent hallway

IN THE HALLWAY

Its a dead end Rick and Ernie are trapped Ernie gives
Rick a sheepish look Stuey stands at the entrance of the
hallway He holds up a Time magazine

STUEY
Rick Rick It says here Noxons
dangerous Why are you lending
your name to it Whats happened
to you Rick You used to be
good And now I just dont

Stuey starts to cry Rick looks guilty
RICK

Dont cry Stuey Im still good

BAM A passing electric baggage cart nails Stuey at full
bloody

speed and carries him off down the corridor screaming
murder

RICK
ALRIGHT

INT FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY

A SEXY STEWARDESS pours champagne for Rick and Ernie The
anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap Rick winks
suggestively at the stewardess She walks off obviously not
interested Rick raises his glass to Ernie oozing sleazy
confidence

RICK
In the bag

The plane hits turbulence and Ricks drink flies up out of
his glass--he catches it as it comes down Another
STEWARDESS helps the Anarchist put his bomb in the overhead
compartment Ernie ogles her She sneers at him We hear
the CAPTAINS voice on the loudspeaker

CAPTAIN (V0)

Ladies and gentlemen this is your
captain speaking To the right of
the aircraft you can see a great
view of the Grand Canyon

All the passengers crane their necks to the right

CAPTAIN (V0)
And to the left you can see a panic-â€”
stricken little troll

Rick turns to his window and flings open the shade to
reveal

STUEY

on the wing pressing his face up against the glass Hes
holding up a publicity shot of Rick and screaming something
we cant hear

RICK
AHHHHHHH
Stuey loses his grip and is whisked off the wing Rick
watches him fall into oblivion

Relieved he turns nonchalantly to Ernie ignoring the other
horrified passengers

RICK
You gonna eat your peanuts Ernie

ERNIE

reveal

RICK AND ERNIE

Standing just outside the airport A porter follows with
their bags

RICK

Ernie nods Theyre distracted by the sound of chanting
They squint into the distance where they see a group of
chanting PROTESTERS--young Save the Earth types latter-

day
hippies kids seniors etc
PROTESTERS
EES mustnt stay Take your toxic
crap away EES mustnt stay
(etc)
Some of their signs read--Say No to Noxon Coogan Go
Home EES is killing our Earth Ricky Coogan Sucks
Shit

a confused OLD MAN shuffling around aimlessly) Drink

Pepsi and finally

Free Nelson Mandela--we WIDEN to reveal the subheading
Inside specially marked boxes We keep WIDENING to reveal
that this is not on a protest placard but a box of cereal
some GUY is eating as he watches the protest

ERNIE
Jesus We better find the limo
before these whale kissers chop us
up and sell us for parts
(he spots the limo)
There it is

Off to the side away from the protesters an unmarked limo

with tinted windows (and plates that say NOT EES) awaits

KEVIN an EES exec leans out the window and waves
discreetly

at Ricky The stewardesses looking tipsy wave their bras
out the back window invitingly

Ernie tries to grab Ricky by the arm but he resists Hes
looking at the protesters

RICK
Wait a second

His POV
A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN

standing in the center of the crowd of protesters holding a
MEGAPHONE to her mouth and chanting She puts down the
megaphone to rest and we can see that shes powerfully
beautiful in a no-nonsense feminist kind of way This is
JULIE Rick is smitten

ERNIE
Lets go Rick Theyre waitin

RICK
Forget them I got a better idea
If I can just find the right

disguise

ERNIE
Coog those hippiesll tear us
apart

Rick spots a HEAVILY BANDAGED MAN limping out of the airport
on crutches Rick approaches him waving a roll of bills

RICK
Hey howd you like to make a quick
hundred bucks

The man mutters something weakly Ernie puts his ear up
close to hear him better

ERNIE

He says the pants dont usually
come off for less than two-fifty
but since youre so cute hell
make an exception

FLIP TO

RICK
buried beneath rolls and rolls of bandages making his way
through the protesters on crutches Ernie helps him along
nervously As Rick spots Julie from behind he hands the
crutches over to Ernie

RICK
Here

Ernie takes the crutches Rick waves his arms dramatically
clutches his bandaged legs and winces in pain

RICK
Help Ow Give me back my
crutches You monster Oh the
pain The agony

He falls theatrically at Julies feet

JULIE
Are you okay Let me help you

RICK

Whats one mans pain weighed
against the global injustice of
corporate tyrants like EES Go
The fight must continue

Julies buying it big time She gazes deep into Ricks eyes

JULIE

Ernie sticks a hand out grinning sarcastically

ERNIE

grabs the crutches from him

ERNIE

Ernie glares at Rick Rick smiles at Julie hopefully Julie
looks at them both and cant help smiling herself

JULIE
(SYMPATHETIC)

ERNIES POV IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
Rick moans and cracks a huge grin through his bandages
Ernie tries to get in on the conversation

ERNIE
Hey Julie You know Im kind of an
idea man myself Like lets say

two people left are you and the

Disgusted Julie smacks Ernie sharply and continues
massaging
Rick Scowling with jealousy Ernie tries a new approach

ERNIE

Coogan guy sure is an asshole huh

JULIE

shit Dont you think so Josh

Rick grits his teeth

RICK

Julie stares at him in shock Rick catches his breath

to break the awkward silence

ERNIE

RICKS POV

on the road behind Julie he sees a crude carnival billboard
featuring a painting of a huge worm with a mans head It
reads See the Incredabel Humin Werm Only at Elijah C
Skuggs Famus Freek Land Julie cant see it

RICK
(DISTRACTED)
Human worm

JULIE

EXT FREEKZ COMPOUND

The car stops at the end of the long spooky driveway just
past a sizzling electric fence Rick Julie and Ernie get
out and look around Its eerily quiet

There is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with

ducts and a tall smoke stack a tattered carnival tent with
an ornate stage flat facade a lopsided outhouse a creepy
broken-down farm house and in the center of it all a giant
molded carnival head with big staring eyes which slowly
rotates on a creaky base

Ernie looks hard at the big eyes He turns away for a
second then spins around again The EYES are looking ina
different direction Ernie shakes his head and unwraps a
chocolate bar

JULIE
Isnt it great Its so real

RICK
Real stupid

(TO ERNIE)
Lets go This place is dead

ERNIE
Yeah Where are all the weirdos

VOICE (0S)
There are no weirdos here

Startled they turn to see ELIJAH C SKUGGS a twisted

haggard old man He takes a bite out of an ice cream cone

which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino
cherry on top Elijah has bad teeth a bad shave and scary
eyes We now realize the giant head is molded in his image

ELIJAH
Mutants yes Genetic nightmares
definitely Children of Hell and
twisted masses of living breathing
tormented flesh certainly But as
for weirdos not a one Unless
of course you count me Ha ha ha

RICK
Nah you seem like a regular
dumbshit old redneck to me

Elijah ignores him Julie shoots him a look and smiles at
Elijah

JULIE
Im Julie And you are

ELIJAH
Elijah C Skuggs proud proprietor
of Skuggs Fabulous Freak Land and
Mutant Emporium But you knew
that After all youve ventured
miles away from civilization
hospitals telephones
(TO RICK)
police How may I help-you

RICK
Drop dead

Elijah smiles unfazed Julie glares at Rick She smiles
apologetically at Elijah

JULIE
Wed like to see your freak show
You see only by appreciating the
variety and innovation of nature
can we come to respect the fragile
complexity of our global eco-
system

Elijah nudges Ernie
ELIJAH
And you come to me looking for

weirdos

Ernie shrugs He goes to take a bite out of his chocolate
bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand
ERNIE
Hey What the--

He looks behind him and there--about ten feet away--is

A HULKING BALD MAN

warts all over squatting on the ground and chewing happily
This is TOAD

Julie and Rick turn and see him

JULIE
(REPULSED)
Eeuuuwww
(composes herself and
WAVES)

Ahem Hello
Toad doesnt respond to her waves

ELIJAH
Mr Toad is my assistant As
for the show Im afraid the next
parade of deformity isnt until
tomorrow night

Rick and Ernie pretend to be disappointed They turn to
leave Julies sincerely upset

JULIE
Oh just our luck

Elijah grabs Ricks shoulder and turns him around

ELIJAH
However I do have a private
exhibit in my shed you might enjoy
I dont usually share it with the
general public

RICK
Were deeply honored But no
thanks

ERNIE

Yeah We really must be--

He raises his cigarette to his lips but its gone He turns
to see Toad ten feet behind him puffing away happily
Hmmm Elijah is already leading Julie towards the shed

JULIE
The sideshow tradition has been
misrepresented by the media You
dont traffic in human misery You
show society the part of itself it

doesnt want to look at

ELIJAH
Yes Yesm I see

He looks over to Rick and Ernie with a grin that says

Whered you find this nutty chick

Rick shrugs and follows taking Ernie with him

ERNIE
What the heck Well see some
pickled dog brains maybe some
pictures of women with you know
added equipment

RICK
And to think we could be in the

limo with those stewardesses

Elijah holds the shed door open for them

Its pitch black

inside Julie enters Rick and Ernie follow

ERNIE
What the hell Coog these people
are weird but they seem nice
enough

A CUTE BUNNY

sits outside the shed THWAP Toad lashes
foot tongue and sucks the bunny into his
into the shed crunching contentedly

Elijah closes the shed doors in our face
a long peal of EVIL LAUGHTER from inside

ELIJAH
AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA HE-HE-HE HA-
HAHA HE-HO-HE-HE-HA-HA AH-HA-HA-
HEHA YAH-HA-HA-HA-HEE-HEE-HO-HA-

INT SHED

Its dark and spooky Elijah stands in a pool of light
reading a Family Circus cartoon in the funny pages

ELIJAH
HA-HE-HE-HE God I love the Family
Circus How do they do it day
after day Its amazing

He turns to

RICK JULIE ANDERNIE

as Toad finishes strapping them onto massive Frankenstein-
style operating tables They struggle desperately against
THE STRAPS

RICK
(TO ELIJAH)
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND

ELIJAH
Well I guess they do use the same
joke over and over Im just a
sucker for that little moffets
shenanigans thats all
(he tosses the funnies

ASIDE)
But perhaps I should tell you a
little more about what I do You
see I not only exhibit freaks I
make them Just like Michelangelo
saw the angel in the stone I look
at a guy like Kevin Costner and see
a giant peach grub who can fart the
Blue Danube
(mops brow asks

OFFHANDEDLY)
Am I crazy or is it hot in here

Rick Julie and Ernie shoot him a look that pretty well
answers his question Elijah shrugs and goes back to his
spiel

ELIJAH
Behold The Tasty Freekz machine
replaced

He pulls a tarp off a huge complicated machine Several
drums and vats of various chemicals feed through a crude
network of pipes gadgets and computers into an old Tasty
Freeze soft serve ice cream machine (The logo has been

changed to Tasty Freekz) The biggest vat reads NOXON
24
JULIE
My God Hes using Noxon Twenty-
Four
RICK
Hey Youre not supposed to have
that stuff
ELIJAH

Oh Well I guess Im not supposed
to have these either

He holds up a matching towel and washcloth embroidered with
the Ramada Inn logo Rick Julie and Ernie gasp He
tosses the towels

As Elijah gets worked up into a frenzy the ambience in the
room becomes more and more horrific the sunlight is

by an eerie green glow a thunderstorm rumbles to life a
raven perches on the windowsill a rat scurries across the
floor one of those plastic Bony Banks reaches out and
grabs a quarter

ELIJAH

I need only punch a few buttons on
this magnificent device and it
gives me an easy-to-apply ointment
that will mutate a perfect young
body bubble its skin warp its
bones and twist its guts into AN
UNSPEAKABLY REPULSIVE STOMACH-
TURNING FREAK OF MY OWN DESIGN

Elijahs hair is now standing on end Hes foaming at the
mouth A bolt of lightning and THUNDERCLAP cap the
monologue

JULIE
Wait a minute Does this mean
were not going to see a show

ELIJAH

Toad fire up that machine and
lets turn these hapless asswipes
into monstrosities

ELIJAH

freaked first

ERNIE
(points at Julie)
Ladies first

JULIE
Go screw yourself

ERNIE
If I were you I would

ELIJAH
Hmmmm

Toad is adjusting some knobs on the machine Elijah steps
past him to a jerry-rigged computer console He punches some
keys and some rotating DNA models appear on the monitor

ELIJAH
(mumbling to himself)
Its like Yin and Yang ACDC
two birds with one stone Yeah
its pretty darn good really

He presses enter and the computer beeps He smiles

ELIJAH
Let er rip Toad

Toad yanks a pull-start cord and the machine rumbles to

Elijah pulls the Tasty Freekz lever and fills a small dish
with phosphorescent ointment Toad cuts open their clothes
exposing their sides and pushes them close together

ERNIE
Wait a second Youre really gonna
smear that stuff on us and mutate
our body parts

ELIJAH
Correct
ERNIE
Well then could you give me a

really big rodney

ELIJAH
Im a mad scientist pal not a
miracle worker

Elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides Their
skin begins to bubble and undulate

JULIEERNIE
Oh God No Holy shit
(ETC)

A grapefruit-sized lump pops up on Ernies side then
another
on Julies side and then the lumps do a little synchronized
dance together Suddenly Ernies flesh balloons out and
melds into Julies side The mass of connected skin
continues to bubble and mutate Odd shapes press up under
THE SKIN

Four humans faces that quickly become Mount Rushmore

The Pepsi logo--Pepsi The Choice of a New Generation
Julie and Ernie merge into one amorphous flesh blob which
then takes the form of

Demon versions of GUMBY and his magic horse POKEY Gumbys
got his back to camera Hes grabbing his crotch and
flipping everyone off

ELIJAH
Gumby Put that thing away

Gumby and Pokey mutate back into a blob and then into
JULIEERNIE

joined side to side their two heads on a single body which

is split down the middle--half Julie half Ernie Elijah

wheels a large mirror in front of them

ELIJAH
Feast your eyes

JULIE
NooOoOoO

ERNIE
Well at least Ill never have to
go far for a piece of tail

JULIE
Pig

She SMACKS him

ERNIE
Ouch I was just trying to keep
things light Oh God Why me

He starts blubbering uncontrollably Toad drags them towards
the door

JULIE
Mother always said thered be days
like this And I thought she was
nuts

They exit Elijah turns to Rick

ELIJAH
(gestures to JulieErnie)
A mere party trick But you

Elijah steps over to the computer console and starts
punching
keys

RICK
(GETS TOUGH)
Let me go Skuggs or else
(MORE)

I got some RICK(contd)
friends thatll come
down here and mess you up bad

tries a different
APPROACH)
I got some other friends who can

Superbowl no problem

(switches gears again)
You ever had a hot fudge bath with
Morgana foreign take Madonna

ELIJAH
(LOOKS UP--INTERESTED)
You know her

Rick nods hopefully Elijah considers it for a moment then
frowns

ELIJAH
Ah screw it Id never get
anywhere with her TOAD FIRE UP
THAT INFERNAL YOGURT MACHINE

Toad starts the machine Elijah pulls the lever and
dispenses a bowl full of glowing ointment He carries it
towards Rick leering maniacally

ELIJAH
For years Ive strived to create
the ultimate monster The first of
a whole new generation of
superfreaks Now Ive finally got
you the perfect subject--a real
asshole HA-HA-
(he pauses and looks
closer at Rick)
Wait a minute Arent you the guy

EXT THE LAB - NIGHT
The barn looks especially sinister silhouetted against a big
green moon A huge ball of flame belches out of the smoke

stack

RICK (0S)
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRGGGGGGG

DISSOLVE TO

EXT THE LAB - MORNING

Its eerily quiet in the dawn light

INT LAB

Extreme close-up of Ricks eye as it opens and searches the
room frantically Close-up of Ricks hand--a normal hand--
straining at the bonds

RICKs POV groggily searches the lab and picks up the
blurred image of Elijah in the distance Hes on the phone
speaking in hushed tones

ELIJAH
This is Red Swan May I speak to

For a moment Elijah is entertained by hold music to the
tune

of Freak Out by Chic A mans laughing voice comes on the

other end of the line It laughs throughout the

conversation

ELIJAH

Laughing man resumes laughing Elijah listens intently

Elijah hangs up the phone and strides over towards Rick

ELIJAH
Wakey wakey Time to meet and

He flips the slab right-side up and holds up a mirror
Ricks eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new
form Ricks left half has been transformed into a hideous

bug-eyed monster

RICK
AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh

EXT LAB - MORNING

BANG The doors fly open Elijah drags Rick out
Horrified Rick clutches the monster side of his face

RICK
Oh God This was my good side

ELIJAH

the show tonight

Elijah stops in front of the tiny outhouse

ELIJAH (CONTD)
Welcome to your spacious
accommodations

He unlocks the door and drags Rick in

INT OUTHOUSE

Oddly the interior is a vast barracks fifty feet long and
thirty feet high Rick looks around

RICK
(IMPRESSED)
Great use of the space

ELIJAH
I learned it all from Bob Vila

BOB VILA walks up next to Elijah
BOB
You know you could expose those
rustic beams and put in a skylight

over one weekend Elijah

ELIJAH
Give it a rest Bob

He pushes Bob away into the freak house gives Rick a
goodbye
wink and walks out the door

EXT OUTHOUSE

Elijah pauses and looks at the tiny outhouse
ELIJAH
One of these days I gotta puta

Bob Vila steps out of nowhere again holding a Time-Life
book

BOB
No problem Its all here in my
Beds and Bathrooms book Elijah
And you pay nothing for thirt--

BONK Elijah knocks him out cold with a ball-peen hammer
from his tool belt

INT FREAK HOUSE

It takes a few moments for Ricks eyes to adjust to the dim
light Theres nobody in sight The walls are lined with
dark cubicles stacked atop each other with walkways like
prison cells Rick staggers to his feet and makes his way
forward

RICK
Ernie Julie

ERNIE

Rick assumes a threatening pose

RICK

Kind of the top dog

Juan scratches himself behind the ear with his hind leg

JUAN
Welcome to Hell Rick Shake

He extends a hand to Rick Rick doesnt take it He hears a

slight RUSTLING noise from the direction of the cubicles
and

turns to look around the apparently empty Freak House

RICK
No thanks I dont plan on staying
long How many of you are there in
here anyway

Juan shrugs mischievously and sticks his snout in Ricks
face

JUAN
First I have a question for you
Ricardo Who starred in the film
International Velvet

RICK
Huh

JUAN
Well perhaps we should ask the
Worm

The top right cubicle lights up revealing the WORM He is a
man with no arms and legs and the wrinkly slimy body of a
worm His face is learned-looking with spectacles a small
goatee and a pipe which he puffs on pompously

JUAN
Tell us Worm who starred in
International Velvet

He puffs pensively on his pipe for a second

THE WORM
Yes yes very interesting
International Velvet The
perfectly appalling sequel to
National Velvet I believe No
dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever

JUAN
Yes Worm But who was the star

The worm takes a long thoughtful drag on his pipe

WORM
Olivia DeHavilland

JUAN
Olivia DeHavilland Rick do you
agree or disagree

RICK
This is nuts This is crazy
Besides it was Tatum ONeill

JUAN
Very good It was Tatum ONeill
now married to tennis star John
McEnroe Circle gets the square

The lights come on in 9 of the center cubicles silhouetting
9 freaks in a full size HOLLYWOOD SQUARES 3 x 3 layout The
FREAKS applaud Ricks success Hes incredulous

OTHER FREAKS

Worm nudges an 0 into place in his cubicle with some
difficulty Hes not happy about being proved wrong

WORM
Blast ONeill No talent
ragamuffin

JUAN

As Juan names the freaks one by one their square is
highlighted and they wave at Rick cheerily

JUAN (CONTD)
Nosey the Nose Man
NOSEY is a man whose massive nose dominates his head He
blows into a huge hanky and waves it wearily at Rick

JUAN (CONTD)

his throatless sock mouth

JUAN

apathetically

JUAN
Rosie the Pinhead

ROSIE is a pinhead in dark sunglasses She has a great bod

and waves a small arrogant big-star wave

JUAN
The hideous Frog Man

Frogman is just a guy in a scuba outfit He strikes a
threatening monster pose then gives a friendly wave

JUAN
And of course in the center

square Mr Paul Lynde

Suddenly the lighting changes to flashing red horror lights
with plenty of dark shadows Theres a horrific MUSIC STING
and we ZOOM IN to a DECOMPOSING SKELETON in the center
cubicle Its eyeball drips out of the socket

JUAN
Well JulieErnie who will it be

ERNIE
Call me old-fashioned but Ill go
with Paul Lynde

JULIE
Dont be an idiot

They argue back and forth hitting and poking each other 3
Stooges style Juan turns to Rick

JUAN
You see Rick Just because were
freaks doesnt mean we cant have
some fun huh

Rick is overwhelmed by it all He backs away

RICK
Get away from me Get away Im
not like you You hear me Im
Ricky Coogan I AM NOT A FREAK

The Freaks laugh in Ricks face He storms off
DISSOLVE TO
ANOTHER AREA OF THE FREAK HOUSE--A LITTLE LATER

Rick sits in a corner pondering his fate Oddly theres a
shiny new Pepsi machine in this dingy corner of the Freak
House JulieErnie approach him

ERNIE
Okay Coog so I get twenty four
hour access to T â€˜n A and you
look like a plate of rancid
giblets Were still pals right

Rick shoots him a look
JULIE

All the freaks have gone through
this anguish Rick At first I
was blinded by my anger I admit
it I wanted to break your neck
for getting me into this But I
got over it Juan taught me to
channel my anger for the common
good

RICK
It was your fault anyway You
wanted to see the freak show

JULIE
(FURIOUS)
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP

She tries to wring his neck Ernie helps Rick glares at
Ernie

RICK
Ernie

ERNIE
Oh Sorry Coog For a second
there I was a total man-hater
Weird

Julie regains her cool She takes out a pamphlet scribbles
something on it and hands it to Rick

JULIE
Here Take it

Rick examines the cover He reads it aloud

RICK
So Youre a Hideous Mutant Freak--
Now What

Theres an 8 scribbled on the pamphlet

JULIE
were in cubicle eight Maybe
later youll be ready to talk

RICK
Forget it Not me Im not like
those other god-forsaken animals

He throws the-pamphlet to the ground just as the Worm
Bearded Lady and Sockhead approach They sit down in a
circle around him The Worm looks down at the pamphlet and
puffs thoughtfully on his pipe

WORM
Youre mistaken Rick You are
exactly like us We were all
normal healthy folk before we made
the fateful mistake of visiting
this hell hole at an off hour
Why when I first came here

WAVY FLASHBACK
DISSOLVE TO

EXT FREAK COMPOUND - THE PAST

The Worm as an OXFORD PROFESSOR is wandering around the
grounds taking notes and puffing on his pipe

WORM (VO)

I was a professor of lacrophylogy--
er the study of worms of course
I came in search of the
Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman
terms the fat pudgy worm Mr
Skuggs said he had just such a worm
in his shed How could I have
surmised that the specimen and I
would ultimately prove to be one
and the same

We see professor Worm meet Elijah and follow him into the
lab The smoke stack belches a plume of flames as we hear
his off-camera screams DISSOLVE back to

THE FREAK HOUSE--NOW

The Worm finishes his tale

WORM
At first the transformation was
fabulous I truly understood the
worms ethos like never before
But those early days of fascination
are over Now in retrospect I
think the whole thing is a fucking
headache Id sell my soul just to
be able to wipe my own ass
He sniffles a little but manages to hold back the tears

pan to Sockhead

SOCKHEAD
I first came here as a tourist
looking for some fun

FLASHBACK
DISSOLVE TO

EXT FREAKLAND - THEN

A lanky TOURIST obviously Sockhead in better days He
approaches Elijah

SOCKHEAD (VO)

Anyway then Elijah turned me into
a sock Thats it

INT FREAK HOUSE - NOW
Sockhead shrugs apologetically

SOCKHEAD
Sorry Im not much for stories

The camera moves in on the BEARDED LADY

BEARDED LADY

When I arrived here I was nothing
like I am now

FLASHBACK
DISSOLVE TO

EXT FREAKLAND - THEN

The bearded lady (as a man) steps out of the cab of his
eighteen-wheeler He looks very much like he does now

except he has no lipstick or earrings

BEARDED LADY (VO)

I was confused--a walking
contradiction so full of
questions

We
INT FREAK HOUSE - NOW
He finishes his story

BEARDED LADYMAN

Now I know who I am I can say
Hey world This is me Ima
woman And I like me

The others look at the bearded man uneasily The camera pans
past the Bearded Lady and moves in on an ordinary HAMMER
lying on the ground

FLASHBACK
DISSOLVE TO

INT HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Happy music The hammer is placed on a shelf by a friendly
STOCKBOY The music turns tense as Elijah appears and scans
the shelf He makes eye contact with the hammer and smiles
He grabs the hammer roughly and shoves it in a plastic bag
Darkness

EXT FREAKLAND - THEN

The bag opens Elijah reaches in and takes out the hammer
The music turns to Psycho-like string stabs as Elijah uses
the hammer to smash in a nail

INT FREAK HOUSE - NOW

Everyone looks at the hammer sympathetically Rick turns
away to wipe a tear from his eye

WORM
You are one of us now Rick
Whether you admit it or not Its
irrefutable

RICK
Yeah Says you

The worm shakes his head The freaks turn and head back to
their cubicles Rick exchanges a look with Julie before she
and Ernie turn and head off

Rick is left alone staring pensively at the hammer

TIME DISSOLVE
TO

Hours later Rick is still staring at the hammer He picks
it up and stares at it more closely

TIME DISSOLVE
TO

Hours later Rick is still staring at the damn hammer He
nods with resolve

RICK
(TO HAMMER)
Youre right

He spots the pamphlet on the ground picks it up dusts it
off He opens it and begins to read under the heading 1
Its Fun Being Ugly

Rick closes the pamphlet looks at the number 8 Julie
scribbled and nods with a sense of purpose Standing up he
throws the hammer carelessly aside into the muck and walks
towards the cubicles

cut To

INT FREAK HOUSE - DAY

Rick walks past the cubicles In one the Bearded Lady knits
a sweater He reaches cubicle 8 and is about to speak
when he hears Julie giggling There is a mans voice but
not Ernies Its Juan

Rick peeks around and sees Julie scratching Juans belly He
licks her face happily and she giggles with delight Ernie
is reading The Womans Room trying not to notice all of
this

Rick watches disgusted He tears up the pamphlet throws it
to the ground and storms off to find his own cubicle

Ernie peeks at Julie and Juan continuing their foreplay
Juan stops abruptly

JUAN
Hey Mind your business

ERNIE
Sorry

Ernie returns to his book The camera PANS up to Ricks
cubicle Hes sitting on his cot distractedly whittling a
log with his knife-like talon He talks to himself making
sure to be loud enough for JulieErnie and Juan to hear

RICK
Well that EES guy should rescue me
any minute Then its straight to
the plastic surgeon and back to
sunny old LA I wonder how many
of my beautiful anatomically
correct girlfriends will be waiting
for me

STUEY GLUCK (VO)
Ill be waiting for you Rick

RICK
Thanks Stuey

Rick looks up and sees a holographic image of Stuey Gluck
floating in the air above him

RICK
AHH A phantom troll

He swings the log wildly at the hologram but it keeps
darting around dodging the blows Cowboy leans around the
cubicle wall He talks a lot like Gomer Pyle

COWBOY
(NEIGHBORLY)
Seeing phantom trolls Rick

RICK
(INNOCENTLY)
No

Rick stops swinging lamely pretends he was stretching and
ignores Stuey who hovers around him

COWBOY
Sounds to me like youve developed
a telepathic bond Dont mean yer
nuts or nuthin Heck old Nosey
why he can smell the future Lots
of us freaks got ESP And
Sockhead hes got ESPN
He points at Sockhead whos watching pro wrestling ona
portable TV

SOCKHEAD
Watch out Hulk Hes gonna try
the skull cracker

COWBOY
Shucks Rick youre lucky
Telepathy like yours only occurs
between real soulmates A bond
like that should be cherished

Cowboy smiles and ducks back into his own cubicle

STUEY
Wow Im Ricky Coogans soulmate

RICK
In your dreams Now get lost

He swings wildly at the hologram which starts to break up
and fade away

STUEY
(FADING AWAY)
Waitll I tell the kids at school

Stuey disappears Cowboy leans into Ricks cubicle again

COWBOY
Shucksm Rick it dont make sense
to spurn your soulmate I reckon

Rick scoffs at him and starts whittling again

scale model of the Eiffel Tower made entirely out of
toothpicks The Human Torch walks by

But look this ones crooked

We follow a KINDLY FATHER through the curtained entrance
OOF He collapses a knife embedded in his chest revealing
the total mayhem

INSIDE THE TENT

The motley crowd (LOCALS sleazy looking MOBSTERS rogue
BIKERS wayward HIPPIES and JAPANESE TOURISTS etc) is
brawling and drinking and having a heck of a time

Some small displays and a few carnival booths are set up
around the sides of the tent Theres a PETTING ZOO where
a KID is petting a two-tailed-no-headed dog And theres a
HEAVY PETTING ZOO where a GUY is french kissing a six-
legged goat

A CLOWN sits in a dunk tank heckling the customers The
sign says DUNK ME IN ACID

CLOWN
Cmon my granny could throw better

Hes talking to an OLD LADY who throws a baseball hits the

target and dunks the clown into the foaming bath of
carbolic

acid We hear his gurgling screams then his bony hand

reaches up out of the bath

Elijah walks out on stage and looks at the rowdy audience
Its total mayhem

ELIJAH
(CALMLY )
Quiet please

Everyone instantly sits down shuts up and looks up
obediently at Elijah

ELIJAH
Thank you Ladies and gentlemen
you are about to witness a
cavalcade of atrocities so
horrific I advise the more
sensitive members of our audience
to leave the premises

Two SENSITIVE LOOKING MEN wearing sweaters draped over their
shoulders politely get up and leave

ELIJAH
Tonight Im proud to announce the
addition of several new
monstrosities to the show
including our star attraction the
Beast Boy--an untamed and highly
dangerous ghoul whos liable to go
nuts and kill us all at the drop of

a hat
(impressed oohs â€œahhs
and cools from the

AUDIENCE)
But first up prepare to behold an
unspeakably repulsive yet
heartwarming atrocity Three Men
and a Baby

THREE MEN AND A BABY all fused into a single multi-limbed
freak walks out onstage One of its arms holds up a dirty
diaper and all the three men hold their noses and grimace
by

signsof

The audience breaks into warm-hearted laughter and applause
BACKSTAGE
The freaks mill around in the caged-in green room guarded

Toad Frogman dressed in a magicians outfit over his
wetsuit holds an empty dove cage and searches the room
whistling for his missing dove Nosey sneezes up a cloud of
feathers JulieErnie walk determinedly towards the adjacent
Mens and Womens restrooms BONK They hit the wall
between the two doors

Rick is reading his script rehearsing his lines Hes
wearing a cheesy jungle costume

RICK

He peers through the bars scanning the audience for

a rescue party

RICK
Damn it Whats keeping those

The Worm creeps up behind Rick

WORM
Somethings troubling you my boy
what is it

RICK
Well lets see Ive been
kidnapped hideously disfigured
imprisoned with a bunch of mutant
freaks my rescue party is M1A
and this dialogue makes Hey Dude
Three read like Dr Zhivago

WORM
I think I know what youre going
through I too had an eating
disorder You see Ive always had
a feverish obsession with pudding
holding

goofy-

And when I was a young lad

Rick groans and looks out at the audience
ELIJAH

onstage

ELIJAH
And now a perennial favorite here
at Freakland ladies and gentlemen
I know youll all enjoy the musical
stylings of Rosie the Pinhead

Rosie the Pinhead struts out wearing a sexy dress and

a microphone After the applause dies down she whips off
her sunglasses with a flourish revealing her extremely

looking crossed eyes She wails incomprehensibly and bonks
her head with the mic

JULIE
Oaf

She bonks him with their cane He bonks her back She
knocks him cold They both fall down
THE BEARDED LADY

is doing a make-over demonstration Hes got a local GIRL
from the audience sitting at a makeup table onstage

BEARDED LADY

If your coloring is in the autumn
range like Marias try an earth
tone eye makeup Now Ive done a
lovely French braid on Maria but I
encourage everyone to experiment
and use your imagination The main
thing is to just have fun with it

The audience is engrossed Some take notes
SOCKHEAD
is ringing those tuned bells and singing along

SOCKHEAD
Edelweiss Edelweiss

He takes a bow but his sock is snagged on the mic stand It
pulls off and reveals a normal-sized hand where the sockhead
was--hes actually a hand-head The audience gasps A MAN
gets up and points accusingly

MAN
Hes got a hand under there

SOMEONE ELSE
Its a hoax

Sockhead realizes hes unveiled and tries to hide his hand-
head with his other hands The crowd starts jeering and
pelting Sockhead with rotten vegetables He gives them the
finger with all three hands Elijah tries to calm them

ELIJAH
Puppetteering is an admirable skill
in its own right Give him his
due

THE CROWD
Wheres the beast boy you promised
us Bring on the beast boy We
want the beast boy (etc)
BACKSTAGE

The Worm is still talking to Rick We can hear the crowd
screaming for him in the background

WORM
And when I won first prize they
never called me pudding-head again

RICK
So

WORM
Dont you see You must turn your
hardship into inspiration Youre
an actor Rick Your body is your
instrument and with it you must
play your tragic symphony for all
the world

Rick is really moved Elijah pokes his head backstage

ELIJAH

(TO RICK)
Theyre going nuts for you Beast
Boy You better go out there now

He starts to take off his jungle costume

RICK
(determined inspired)
Ill be right there

(TO WORM)

Thank you Worm I dont really
know how I can repay you for this

WORM
(SINCERE)
You could wipe my ass

RICK
(thinks Worm is joking)
Ha-ha Always the wit eh Worm

Rick claps him on the back and walks off Worm is
disappointed

WORM
(TO HIMSELF)

Damn
(he turns to Nosey)
Nosey have I ever told you what a
gifted artist you are

Nosey gives him a worried look
ONSTAGE

The spotlight reveals Rick centerstage poised in
Shakespearean garb The crowd quiets down and focuses on
Rick with great respect and awe A truly dramatic silence
Rick pauses for effect and then launches into a soliloquy
with bravura

RICK
Now is the winter of our
discontent
Made glorious summer by this son of
York
But I that am not shaped for
sportive tricks
Nor made to court an amorous
looking glass
I that am curtailed of this fair
proportion
Cheated of feature by dissembling
nature

The audience is riveted Even Spanish-speaking peasants are
mouthing the words Elijah however thumbs through his
script totally confused The freaks watch through the bars
from the wings--completely engrossed especially Julie Juan
notices this and pulls her closer to him but she pushes him
away

We move in on an erudite British gentlemen in the crowd By
God Its ALISTAIR COOKE He turns to camera Subtitle
ALISTAIR COOKE

ALISTAIR COOKE
(SOTTO VOCE)
If youre having trouble
understanding Mr Coogans
brilliant reading of this soliloquy
from Richard the Third please take
advantage of the handy subtitles
for the culturally illiterate

A FILTHY PEASANT sitting next to Cooke is trying to listen
Rick He turns angrily to Cooke

FILTHY PEASANT
SHHH

Cooke turns back to the stage The words in brackets appear
as SUBTITLES

RICK
Deformed unfinished sent before
my time

IM UGLY

Into this breathing world scarse
half made up

IM REALLY UGLY

And that so lamely and
unfashionable That dogs bark at me
as I halt by them

IM F KIN BUTT-UGLY ALRIGHT
Why I in this weak piping time of
peace

BLAH BLAH BLAH

Have no delight to pass away the
time

I NEVER GET LAID

Unless to see my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity
BECAUSE IM UGLY

Rick bows The crowd bursts into applause They yell
Bravo and throw bouquets Rick takes several curtain
calls The freaks cheer for him Julie is particularly
moved--she and Rick exchange a heavy look laden with
romantic potential NOTE We will insert an almost
subliminal one-frame shot of the Pepsi logo at this
triumphant moment

Kevin the EES executive from the airport scene walks into
the tent Rick sees him and gasps with joy He leaps off

the stage runs up to Kevin and hugs him Kevin is shocked
of course Overcome by the moment Rick regresses to his old
self

RICK
Im saved Haha You sorry
mutants are gonna rot in this hole
while Im sipping mint juleps by
the pool
AS FORTUNE SMILES OER MY FATE SO
DESTINY SPURNS YOUR ACCURSED PATE

The freaks and the audience gasp at Ricks cruelty Julie is
shocked--Juan gives her an I told you so look Rick sees
Julie and catches himself

RICK

(TO KEVIN)
I mean um I hope you have room
for all my friends heh-heh

KEVIN
Rick Rick listen I really love
this new look youve come up with
But just between you and me I
dont think the guys upstairs would
really get it

RICK
What are you saying

KEVIN

(CHUCKLES SNIDELY)
Im saying youre ugly enough to
burn the nosehairs off a dead nun

The crowd bursts into cruel hysterics pointing mockingly at
Rick Even Alistair Cooke is practically choking with
laughter

ALISTAIR COOKE
AH-HA-HA-HA WHAT A PUTZ

Rick looks around horrified at the sea of evil jeering
faces He begins to tremble Then

RICKS MONSTER EYE

springs to life for the first time and glows red with rage

His whole monster side awakens and takes charge of his body

with violent intensity He grabs Kevins head and screams in
a new monstrous voice

RICK
EAT SHIT

POP He plucks Kevins head off his neck and holds it aloft
The head stares down at Rick in disbelief

KEVINS HEAD
Now youre just being childish

Rick serves the head like a volleyball smashing it to bits
idly

The crowd panics and charges for the exits

CROWD

JulieErnie The Bearded Lady Nosey and Dog Boy who are
playing a game of Wheel of Fortune The cubicles contain
large blank blocks like the letters on the game show So

He shakes his finger at Juan and notices theres still a
human nose stuck on his monster claw He wipes it off
embarrassed Theres an awkward pause Ernie breaks the
silence
ERNIE

Juan gives Ernie a nasty shut up look He growls at him

ERNIE

a pathetic lot and their half-hearted howl proves it

FREAKS

JULIE
Juans plan is really ingenious
Rick See he figured out that--

JUAN
I figured out that our escape does
not include the Beast Boy No one
may discuss the plan with him
understand

Juan gives the others a threatening look They mumble
agreement

RICK
Whats the matter with all of you
You trust your lives to a guy just
cause he can lick his own
privates

The freaks ponder this a second then nod yes

ERNIE

helluva trick

Pus Monkeys as the secret phrase Everyone claps despite
themselves Juan stares them down They stop

Rick storms off in a huff Juan takes Julies hand and gazes
deep into her eyes He kisses her passionately Julie is
watching Rick leave Juan nibbles her neck which gets her
attention She scratches Juan behind his ear His leg
instinctively kicks the air Ernie looks worried

ERNIE

INT REAR CORNER OF FREAK HOUSE - DAY

Out of sight from the others Rick approaches the rear door
and tries it It doesnt open from the inside

RICK
Damn

He peers out through a crack in the door and sees a MILKMAN
getting out of his truck in the driveway

RICK

(TO MILKMAN)
Psst Hey you Milkman

The milkman looks over at the outhouse suspicious

MILKMAN

The milkman stops in his tracks He tiptoes over to the back
writing

door of the outhouse listening intently as Rick goes into
his act

RICK
(in a lusty womanish
VOICE)
Ooohh Milk me Milk me now

Milk me hard

(Normal Rick voice)

Ive only got two hands all right
Geez I dont care if Elijah did

The milkman is salivating at the door

MILKMAN
(TO HIMSELF)
Gee I love eggnog

The milkman opens the door eagerly and steps inside Beat

MILKMAN
Hey what the--

BONK We hear the sound of bottled buttermilk beaning his
soft noggin Rick walks out wearing the milkman outfit
complete with the little six-milk-bottle-carrier thing

He looks around and heads for the milk truck whistling
casually He notices something Its

THE GIANT ELIJAH HEAD

Its big eyes are staring at Rick (note theres a skywriter
plane in the distance behind the head which finishes

YOU GOT THE RIGHT ONE BABY PEPSI) Rick gets to the truck
and tries the door Its locked

RICK
Shit

He looks over at the giant head The eyes are still staring
at him--they seem to have shifted Rick shrugs it off and
looks around He walks over to Elijahs car Its locked
too He checks the big eyes Theyve moved again

Ricks getting a bit desperate He sees something else and
runs towards it Its a dry-docked motorboat Its locked
too The eyes have followed Rick again He sees something
else and runs over to it Its a bag of golf clubs leaning
against Elijahs porch Theyre locked too

RICK
Damn This guy doesnt trust
anybody

He looks at the giant head- the eyes are gone leaving only
empty eyesockets Rick hears A BURST OF MACHINEGUN FIRE
behind him spins around and faces

TWO THREE FOOT HIGH EYEBALLS

with little arms and legs wearing Jamaican Rasta hats and
aiming smoking Uzi 9mms in the air They aim their Uzis at
Rick One holds a walkie-talkie the other holds a big
spliff

RICK
AHHHH

A TV MONITOR in Elijahs hands shows Rick staring at us

smoking a pipe Rick sits on the sofa Toad walks up with a
tray of soft drinks

Rick

ELIJAH

RICK
But I thought I scared everyone

ELIJAH

Uh-huh And then they told two
friends and they told two friends

Elijah grabs a big mail bag and spills some letters out on
the table Elijah opens one and reads it

ELIJAH

and disgusted when my grandson told
me about the head-popping beast at

Rick reaches for the Fiddle Faddle but the bowl is empty
Toad BURPS

ELIJAH
Toad That Fiddle Faddle is for
guests only Youve had enough

Toad is blankfaced Elijah walks over and refills the bowl
Rick scoops some into his mouth Elijah walks to the
fireplace and pushes the embers around with a poker

RICK

public does not want to see
disgusting depraved violent filth

ELIJAH
Oh and I suppose Jake and the
Fatman is just a fluke
spins

The phone rings Elijah looks at it and back to Rick

ELIJAH (CONTD)

He goes over to the phone and lifts the receiver

ELIJAH
â€œYello

On the other end of the line we hear LAUGHING MANs insane
chuckle Elijahs smooth smile fades He turns his back to-
Rick who strains to identify the familiar laughing voice
Elijah scribbles notes on a pad by the phone

ELIJAH
Yes Right Tomorrow
Mmhmm Mnunhmm Wow Okay

Laughing Man hangs up on Elijah He looks a little pissed-
off as he turns to face Rick again Grumbling he takes the
poker in hand and pokes at the coals angrily

ELIJAH

Ricky rises and snatches the notepad just before Elijah
to face him

EXT ELIJAHS HOUSE DAY

Elijah shows Rick out the door The Eyes scurry out and leap
back into the sockets in the giant head

ELIJAH
Bye-bye And remember try another
escape and Ill feed your balls to
Toad

As he walks towards the Freak House Rick pulls out the note
he pocketed A gust of wind blows it away from him He
chases it behind the carnival tent where

KKCCLIINNK He runs into ELEVEN PHONY MILKMEN backing their
way around the corner each carrying their own six-pack of
milkbottles Startled they turn around Why its the
freaks And theyre all dressed as milkmen Cowboy carries
the hammer whos dressed in a little milkman suit as well

BEARDED LADY
Hey Rick I thought you were gonna
come up with your own escape plan

RICK

(TO JUAN)
This is your big plan A dozen
milkmen Isnt that a little
unusual

Juan hadnt thought of this He pushes himself forward and
confronts Rick viciously

JUAN
Twelve milkmen is theoretically
possible Thirteen is silly
Looks like one milkman too many
Coogan

He pushes Rick aside The freaks continue past him
RICK

Fine then Go ahead Hope you
like reggae ya flea bitten
bastard

Rick watches as the Freaks approach the open courtyard
where
he knows the Eyeballs will spot them

Julie glances at him a second then looks away His mind
made up Rick takes a deep breath

RICK
Ah shit

He runs over to the Freaks He stands in Juans way

RICK
Look youll all be killed You
dont know about Elijahs giant
Rasta eyeballs with machine guns
(they think hes nuts)
Its suicide I cant let you do
it

JUAN
And I cant let you stop us

This is it Rick and Juan square off Juan growls and bares
his teeth Ricks MONSTER EYE starts to glow and pulse
dimly They circle each other The others are transfixed

ELIJAHS POV

He peers through a side window and sees the pack of milkmen
cheering two of their coworkers locked in mortal combat

ELIJAH
Thats a lot of milkmen on the same
route No wonder they fight

Juan rears back about to lunge when suddenly he freezes
and
looks off into the distance
A SQUIRREL

is sitting innocently a few yards off

JUAN
Squirrel

He zooms off after the squirrel The Eyes pop out of the
giant head and follow after him Uzis FIRING Juan dodges
their bullets and disappears after his prey
The freaks watch their best chance of freedom run off after
pesky rodent They turn to Rick

WORM
By God its so crazy it might just

ERNIE
But you need Noxon 24 to make the
freaking sludge and Elijah told us
himself hes run out of it

RICK
Oh Oh yeah Well see what I
was going to say was--

JULIE
Yes Exactly If theyve been
using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer
here the entire ecosystem must be
soaked with it All we need is a
way to extract it from the
vegetation ideally into a liquid
form
RICK
Right Well what about--

thought the grass tasted funny
Wow Rick youre a genius

spigot and without hesitation plunges his face into it
Rick Julie and Ernie gasp in horror

The WORM lifts his glop-smeared face out of the bowl and
smacks his lips in delight

machine starts humming Ernie is looking out the window

ERNIE

EXT ELIJAHS HOUSE

Elijah comes out of the house and walks towards the lab

INT LAB

Ricks starting to sweat He looks over at Julie who holds
an empty Pepsi cup under the Tasty Freekz spigot A drop of
ointment drips out and into the container

JULIE
Here it comes

THE LAB DOORKNOB

begins to turn slowly

Everybody freezes The flow of ooze slows to a stop

RICK
Its plugged up

They look over at the doorknob--its still turning

ERNIE

(TO WORM)
If its your damn pudding Ill
ring your wormy neck

WORM
(under his breath)
Preposterous I have no neck

THE DOOR KNOB

is still turning agonizingly slowly
OUTSIDE THE LAB

Elijah is trying to turn the knob His grip keeps slipping
because of the butter on his fingers

ELIJAH
Aaargh Damn buttered popcorn

IN THE LAB

The spigot has started to discharge morereliably The Pepsi
cup is filling up now

OUTSIDE

Elijah is wiping his hands off on his shirt tails He tries
the door knob again

IN THE LAB

We hear a low rumbling and the floor starts to shake

WORM
The tunnel walls are about to
collapse

RICK

JULIE

BUT--
RICK

The door knob is turning more vigorously but still not

opening Julie and Ernie get in the hole with Worm while

Rick attends to the almost-full Pepsi cup of sludge
OUTSIDE

Elijah is still having trouble with his grip

IN THE LAB

Rick pops the plastic lid onto the Pepsi cup and climbs

the hole He rests the cup on the floor and lifts the floor
board over his head The RUMBLING gets louder as the tunnel
walls start to crumble

JULIE
Rick Come on

Rick is losing his balance as the ground shifts beneath him
He sways and knocks the Pepsi cup of sludge rolling He
watches helpless as it rolls across the floor and comes to
a stop across the room For a second he contemplates making
a dash

OUTSIDE

Elijah has wrapped his shirt tails around the knob and
finally has a good grip He twists the knob

INSIDE

Rick sees the door opening He dives down into the hole
The floor board falls into place just as Elijah walks in

Elijah scans the room He goes over towards the Tasty Freekz
machine and finds the styrofoam cup

ELIJAH
Bad for the environment

He crumples it in his hand

EXT FREAK COMPOUND
The antfarm view again We see the freaks running back
through the tunnel as it caves in behind them Toad sits on
the ground above oblivious to them We hear a low flying
aircraft ZAP Toad shoots his tongue up out of frame and
sucks the twin engine Cessna into his mouth Beat He BURPS
and spits up a propeller

INT FREAK HOUSE

The freaks wait by the mouth of the tunnel We hear the
rumble approach The worm JulieErnie and finally Rick
scramble out of the opening The dirt avalanche is stopped
short by Paul Lyndes corpse just as Rick scrambles to
safety

WORM
Just made it

RICK
Paul saved our lives

NOSEY
Way to go Paul

Nosey claps Paul on whats left of his back--his skeleton
shatters and the tunnel collapses burying him instantly
The freaks are horrified

NOSEY

turns to them guiltily in SLOW-MOTION His voice is slowed
down and distorted like John Lennon at the end of
Strawberry
FIELDS

NOSEY
I buried Paul

Back to normal speed

RICK
This is no time to lament over a
cadaver Weve got to get moving
or were history Now cmon

Nosey is still morose He speaks backwards and sounds a lot
like Revolution 9
NOSEY
Daed si luap

SUBTITLE Paul is dead

RICK
I said enough Okay listen up
everybody We cracked the code and
made the ointment we need to bring
Skuggs down for good

The freaks applaud and cheer

RICK
But we left it in the lab

The freaks jeer and pelt Rick with rotten vegetables He
desperately pulls a bag of cookies out of his pocket

RICK
But wait I found some macaroons
And theres plenty for all of us

The freaks burst into applause again

FREAKS
Yaayyy

TIME DISSOLVE

INT FREAK HOUSE - DAY

The Freaks are all sleeping macaroon crumbs still left on
their faces Theres a lot of snoring Rick awakens with a
start He hears something in the distance Something like a
helicopter He gets up and peeks out a crack in the wall

RICKS POV EXT FREAKLAND - DAY

An EES corporate helicopter touches down A few gun-toting
SECURITY GUYS in dark suits and dark glasses get out They
check that the coast is clear then give the signal Out
steps Richard Hertz He mutters something to one of the
security guys and walks towards the Freak House

IN THE FREAK HOUSE
RICK
(under his breath)
I dont believe it Whats Hertz

The door to the Freak House opens Hertz enters unzips his
fly Finding no toilet he shrugs and relieves himself on
the floor Rick steps out of the shadows towards him

RICK
So EES is in bed with Elijah C
Skuggs eh Figures

Hertz is momentarily startled by Rick He collects himself

HERTZ
Rick Thank God I got to you in

RICK

Cut the crap Hertz
Hertz relieves himself as he talks

HERTZ
Ricky you have no idea how your
misfortune has touched our hearts
When you disappeared we almost gave
up hope But wed heard reports of
Skuggss reckless abuse of Noxon
and when the story broke in the
tabloids I decided to personally

things

He zips up and heads to the door

RICK
(SKEPTICAL)

The cackle is unmistakable--Ricks face twists in horror as

We hear a nearby SNORE cut off and the Human Torch stands

from the spot where Hertz relieved himself Hes dripping
wet and no longer on fire He sniffs his soaked smoldering
clothing

TORCH

POOF He catches fire again and walks off Rick is doing a
slow burn still looking after Hertz He erupts and his
monster eye glows briefly He screams in anguish

RICK
AAARRGGGGHH

Dejected Rick leans against the wall JulieErnie walk up
behind him Julie puts a hand on Ricks shoulder to comfort
him As they look into each others eyes a loud CRASH
distracts them Rick peers through the crack

RICKS POV
A caravan of EES trucks crash through the front gate and
drive up to the lab Theres a few cargo trucks and a huge

NOXON-24 tanker

RICK
Holy shit

A forklift drives out of the back of one of the large
carrying the old corporate farts on a wooden palette
One of them falls off and a bunch of WORKMEN scramble out

prop him up and push him back into place

INT LAB - DAY

Elijah switches on the lights and turns to face his

audience Hertz is accompanied by his stone-faced security
men and various executives Workmen are busy installing the
old board of directors and their arm-raising pulley system

ELIJAH
Nice to see you in the flesh
Laughing Man

HERTZ
No need to use codenames Elijah
Were all friends here And just
to prove it I brought you a little
present

Hertz snaps his fingers and nods to a security guy who
produces a wriggling canvas sack He dumps its contents onto
the lab table--its Stuey Gluck His glasses come tumbling
out after him He squints at the security guy

STUEY
Rick Is that you

ELIJAH
Whos the troll

HERTZ
He was asking questions about

Stuey puts on his glasses Elijah looks him up and down

INT FREAK HOUSE

Rick hears Stueys voice in his head all echoey

STUEY(V0)

RICK
Oh no not now Stuey

The ghostly image of STUEY gradually takes shape in front of
Rick Rick can make out the lab table Stueys on and some
shadowy figures in the background

RICK
(TO HIMSELF)
Hey Thats Elijahs lab
(TO STUEY)
Stuey Are you really in the lab

INT LAB

Stuey is still wailing and everybody else is getting pretty
damn annoyed

STUEY

ELIJAH

Toad grabs Stuey and slaps a piece of tape over his mouth
He throws him into one of the chicken cages along the far
wall A two-headed chicken starts to peck at him

HERTZ
So where were we

ELIJAH
Gentlemen Im not going to
bullshit you I know my setup here

potatoes

He pulls the cover off a small scale model of Freakland
about ten inches high It shows the stage lab outhouse
the head everything

ELIJAH
But thanks to your Noxon and my
genius tonight I will turn Ricky
Coogan into a freak so hideous
itll be enough to turn your
stomach inside out boil your brain

sores you thought had healed up to

(the EES men shift

UNCOMFORTABLY)

He whisks the cover off another scale model--its exactly
the
same as the little model except its a lot bigger

ELIJAH (CONTD)

ELIJAH

halfheartedly returns the gesture

RICK

INT LAB
Stuey checks to make sure nobodys watching him Theyre

lock Stuey searches the floor and spots the Pepsi cup
Hell have to crawl through several pairs of legs to reach

ELIJAH
Ha-ha Gee Id love to see your

HERTZ

(to his assistant)
Bill if youd be so kind

BILL BLAZER a slick and dashing EES marketing executive
strides confidently up to the podium

Stuey has to duck the fast approaching legs Bill steps over
him not even noticing hes there

Bill takes Elijahs Freak World graphic off an easel and
replaces it with his own Finding no place to deposit
Elijahs he simply drops it on the floor Elijah looks a
little hurt

BILL
What does todays businessman want
How about a receptionist with six
arms five mouths and a knockout
figure Thatd sure speed things
up wouldnt it

With a big smile Bill reveals an illustration of a multi-
limb secretary (in a sexy dress) talking on three different
phones taking notes and typing all at once

Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup He brushes against the
back of Hertzs legs Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him
who smiles politely Hertz smiles back invitingly Maybe
theres a few things we dont know about him

BILL
In the factory how bout a worker
with twelve busy hands no mouth to
talk back and no genitalia or
digestive system to distract him
from his work

(HE CHUCKLES)
Sure Its what we all dream of

The EES guys all nod along Except for the workmen who
exchange worried looks Elijahs still not sure what to make
of it all

Meanwhile Stuey has the Pepsi cup of sludge in hand and
hes crawling under the table towards the door He brushes
up against the back of Elijahs legs

Elijah looks over to Hertz who gives him that smile again
Elijah looks away quickly panicky

BILL (CONTD)

Well with this Skuggs-based Noxon
technology its not only possible
its just the beginning Of

course what happened to our
expensive spokesman Ricky Coogan
was an unfortunate coincidence but
profits from these new markets
could total in the billions

All the executives turn to Hertz He cracks a smile

HERTZ
Ricky who

The executives laugh heartily Stuey glances across the room
to the door He has to make a break for it so he does

ELIJAH
Hey Hold on

Stuey freezes Hes right out in the open in plain view
Still nobody seems to see him Theyre still watching-
Bills presentation

ELIJAH
Secretaries Worker drones
Wheres the fun Wheres the
spark Wheres the unspeakable
evil

Bill laughs pleasantly

BILL
Ha-ha I was just getting to that

Bill launches back into his speech with more intensity than
even the best infomercials Meanwhile Stuey inches towards
the door moving as imperceptibly as possible

BILL
Well impact every field

COSMETICS--BREAST ENLARGEMENT

calls to Rick through the tape on his mouth

STUEY

INT FREAK HOUSE

Rick sees the image of Stuey inching away from the lab

RICK

Stuey realizes this is true and pulls the tape off his
mouth

STUEY
I got the cup Rick

RICK
Great Theres no time to waste

STUEY
Yeah But if I dont move they

Two big EES security guys are standing watching Stueys odd
behavior They pick him up and carry him away

STUEY
Riiiick
Rick sees this all in his holographic image It fades

RICK
What a geek

He turns to the other freaks whove woken up and are
gathered around on the floor Rick shakes his head

RICK
Stuey got caught Theres no way
to get the ointment before the

show
WORM

He pats the Worm on the head tenderly

COWBOY

RICK

He smiles and playfully tugs Cowboys udder He turns to the

Bearded lady is kind of confused Rick shrugs

RICK
Nosey never really liked you

He moves on to Frog Man

RICK

Frog Man nods in agreement Rick rpaches JulieErnie

RICK

EXTCARNIVAL TENT - NIGHT

A huge banner reads NEW IMPROVED BEAST BOY SLAUGHTERS HIS
LOVED ONES SPECIAL GUEST FUNNYMAN DOM IRERRA TONIGHT
ONLY We can hear the sound of the crowd inside

INSIDE THE TENT

Theres a typically smallish crowd in addition to the EES
executives who occupy the front seats The security goons
are strategically situated throughout the tent and two of
them sit on either side of Stuey in the second row Elijah
is onstage

ELIJAH
And now the moment youve all been
waiting for Ladies and gentlemen

Boy

Toad pulls a rope and the curtain opens revealing Rick
strapped to an operating table On stage left theres a
large cage containing all the other freaks Including the
unconscious half-naked Milk Man who Rick knocked out in the
freak house The Milk Man domes to looks around in a panic
grabs the bars of the cage and screams--

MILK MAN
AAHHHH WERE IN A ZOO

Rick searches the cheering audience for Stuey who waves the
Pepsi cup full of glop in the air Rick hears Stueys voice
echo in his head telepathically

STUEY (V0)
Rick Over here

Stueys waving cup is blocking the view of a big annoyed
BIKER sitting behind him Elijah quiets the crowd and holds

up a beaker of ointment

ELIJAH
With this remarkable ointment of my
own design I will now turn this
half-finished ghoul into the
ultimate super freak dedicated to
evil

Elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick
who squints under the spotlight still searching for Stuey
He calls out telepathically

RICK (V0)
Stuey Where are you

Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup totally
blocking the bikers view He telepathically replies

STUEY (V0)
Here I am Rick

BIKER

(TO STUEY)
Goddammit kid Would you sit
down

The biker grabs the cup and dumps it over Stueys head The
good ointment runs down all over Stueys body
to

cockeyed

STUEY
AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHA

All eyes turn to Stuey who falls down and disappears onto
the floor screaming

RICK
Oh no

BIKER
What the hell

Suddenly an EIGHT FOOT TALL MONSTER VERSION OF STUEY leaps

its feet and snarls down at the biker The biker pulls a
switchblade and jams it into Stuey monsters leg--the blade
crumples on his armor-like hide Stuey grins and SLAM He
drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike He
leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah

STUEY MONSTER

Rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey Monster on
ELIJAH
Uh-oh that kid looks pissed EYE

Eye and Eye rush the stage Uzis firing

The bullets bounce off Stueys hide He doinks them with his
big monster fingers and sends them flying through

Toad catapults through it follows the path of Eye and Eye

across the compound and CRASH Lands head first into the

neck of the Giant Head He gets up with the Giant Head stuck

on his own head making him look like one of those big

caricatures He runs blindly across the yard and into

and Toads tongue sticks ten feet out of the Giant Heads
mouth Its the biggest Tex Avery cartoon take ever

HERTZ

The other executives nod
RICK

starts to transform FWOOP His ears spring out into huge
monster ears kinda like in Pinocchio FWAAP His mouth
grows into a massive Big Daddy Roth style monster mouth
FWEEP His upper head does the same

His body follows suit He bursts out of the straps and
grows into a drooling TEN FOOT TALL RICK MONSTER He snarls
at Stuey Monster

RICK MONSTER

The crowd and the other freaks look on tense Stuey Monster
instinctively whips out a Ricky Coogan publicity photo anda
pen

STUEY MONSTER

Rick Monster snarls and bashes Stuey Monster in the face
Stuey Monster jams the pen through the photo and snarls

THE CROWD

Even Julie is screaming Fight Fight beside herself with
bloodthirsty glee Ernie smacks her

The crowd goes nuts as the monsters trade a series of cliche
pro-wrestling moves Stuey bashes Rick Rick bashes Stuey
etc

ELIJAH

ERNIE

No way The skull cracker is an
illegal move

Stuey grabs Ricks hair and marches him around the stage
The crowd is taking sides screaming out advice and foaming
at their mouths

ELIJAH
Lets get this over with Hey

STUNNED )
What the hell-

HERTZ

stands in front of the a group of EES HARDHATS who are using
forklifts to move the Tasty Freekz Machine towards the exit
He notices Elijah and taps his executive ASSISTANT

ASSISTANT

(TO ELIJAH)
Ahem At this point in time we at
EES regret that we must leave this
performance prematurely

ELIJAH
What are you saying

HERTZ
What were saying is get
stuffed yokel

ELIJAH

I figured I couldnt trust you
corporate greaseballs

Elijah turns to an alarm box on the wall which reads BREAK
GLASS IN CASE OF DOUBLECROSSING CORPORATE GREASEBALLS He
breaks the glass and pulls the lever inside

A trapdoor on the stage opens and a large chemical tank
rises

out of it Elijah jumps into the seat of the gun turret
nozzle atop the tank He aims the nozzle at the EES group

ELIJAH
Let me proudly introduce the latest
in our product line Noxon 25--now
available in a convenient pump

HERTZ
Bullshit The Everything Except
Shoes corporation releases no new
products unless I give the order

ELIJAH
I think its time EES branched out
a little

He presses the plunger and the nozzle spews a torrent of
yellow glop on the EES people They scream in agony as their
bodies melt together into one big mutating blob

Alistair Cooke stands up in the audience--hes got a head
bandage and a crutch from being trampled at the last show

ALISTAIR COOKE
Ahhh Head for the hills before he
gets all of us

The crowd goes berserk and rushes the exits trampling poor
Cooke like a roach

RICK MONSTER

flips Stuey onto the ground and starts stomping on him
Stuey is knocked out cold Rick leaves him on the floor and
stalks the freak cage murderously

RICK MONSTER
NOW I RIP FREAKS TO PIECES

JIMIE
No Were your friends

RICK MONSTER
Oh NOW I RIP FRIENDS TO PIECES

He rips some bars off the cage and is about to spear
JulieErnie with a jagged steel bar when Stuey Monster grabs
his leg and trips him Stuey summons all his remaining
energy to wrestle Rick delaying him for the moment from
slaughtering the freaks

Meanwhile Elijah is watching as
THE EES BLOB

solidifies into A GIANT SHOE made of living flesh Its
got eyeballs where the eyes should be a tongue where the
tongue should be but its helpless and immobile

Elijah looks at it with pride He does his best Ed Sullivan
IMPRESSION

ELIJAH
Now thats a really really big
shoe Ha-ha-ha-ha Hmmm I think
Id like a pair of those

He swivels the nozzle turret towards the cage full of freaks
and is about to glop them when Rick stands up above Stuey
blocking Elijahs trajectory at the freak cage Rick raises
the jagged bar above Stuey ready to drive it down through
his chest

ELIJAH
(to Rick monster)
Would you hurry up and waste the
troll please I got a lonely
shoe over here

Rick Monster nods and drives the spear down when we

RICK
Well lets see the other freaks
were lined up in Elijahs sights
and I was about to shove a pipe
through Stueys skull when all of
a sudden I heard a voice

DISSOLVE TO

INT CARNIVAL TENT - NIGHT
Rick stops the spear inches from Stueys chest Their eyes
meet

ELIJAH
Kill him Kill him

Elijahs bloodthirsty goading fades away and Cowboys voice
reverberates in Ricks head

COWBOY (VO)

I reckon that troll could help you
if you just let him into your
heart your heart your
heart

The voice keeps echoing A tear wells up in Rick Monsters
eye He looks over at Cowboy who is actually calling out to
him from the cage

COWBOY
Your heart your heart your
heart

Rick Monster loses his murderous glare He breaks into a
warm smile throws the pipe away and helps Stuey Monster up
They hug The rest of the Freaks cheer wildly

The Worm is gushing sentimentally He tries to hide his
tears

(Sniff) Shameless maudlin--Baaa

He cant hold it in anymore He bawls like a baby
Meanwhile Elijah is hopping mad

ELIJAH
Cut the lovey-dovey bullshit and
start mutilating each other

He aims at Rick Monster and presses the fire button The
Glop starts to flow but before it can make it out of the
tip Rick grabs hold of the nozzle and twists it around to
face Elijah
RICK
Raarrrrrrgh

Elijah manages to duck just in time A stream of yellow
Noxon 25 glop flies over his shoulder and lands in the DUNK
TANK full of carbolic acid that sits off to one side of the
tent

The acid and the Noxon mix together and bubble up
menacingly

Elijah hops down out of the gunners chair and squares off
against Rick Monster

Meanwhile Stuey Monster has released the other freaks from
the cage They watch the confrontation from a distance

Elijah rolls up his sleeves Rick growls and advances
slowly

ELIJAH
You think I made you strong HA
Ive cranked my DNA up so high you
wont know what hit you Ima
wrecking machine Aaaaaaa

He rushes at Rick and delivers a flurry of punches to his

mid
section They have absolutely no effect Rick brings one
heavy fist slamming down on Elijahs head stopping him
cold
ELIJAH
(WEAKLY)

Ow I think you crushed my spinal
cord I cant feel anything in my
fingers

RICK
Maybe youll feel this

Rick rears back to kick him
ELIJAH
Qait--if you kill me youll never
find the antidote

The freaks all perk up Ricks skeptical

RICK
What antidote

ELIJAH
A time release serum--I baked it
into a delicious batch of
macaroons

A slow smile grows on the Freaks faces especially Ricks

RICK
If you ask me you skimped on the
coconut

THWAK Rick boots Elijah between the legs sending him
flying through the air He lands on the DUNK TANK SEAT over
the bubbling NoxonAcid Dazed he looks at the bullseye
target and back at Rick Summoning up his last ounce of
bravado Elijah makes a last stand

ELIJAH
Come on Coogan Come oooon You
havent got the guts to kill me
Go on I dare ya

Rick ponders for a second He looks over to Julie Then

SCRAPPY
Yap Yap

RICK
Scrappy

Scrappy the dog rushes in He leaps up and presses the
bullseye dropping Elijah into the hideous mixture

ELIJAH
AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHH

Elijah struggles in agony His body bubbles and mutates in
the thick toxic soup He sinks lower and lower into the
gunk until he and his cries are buried for good

Scrappy leaps into Ricks arms and licks his face

of the details

justice Rick God only knows how
far his sick plans wouldve gone

ANOTHER FBI GUY
Hey chief look at this

The FBI guy has peeled the decal off the Pepsi machine
revealing that its actually a Coke machine The chief is
sickened to the core

FBI CHIEF
Is nothing sacred

Suddenly the agents are distracted by a terrible scream
They turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see
FBI CHIEF
Oh my Lord

RICK
No It cant be

We SWISH PAN over to reveal a DRIPPING BLOB climbing out of
the dunk tank The blob separates into two distinct entities
with their backs to us They turn around andmy God

REGIS AND KATHIE LEE

Or at least a damn fine mutant imitation of them Call
himthem ELIJUS and ELLY LEE They both have glowing red
demon eyes and speak in Elijahs voice

ELIJUS

ELLY LEE

FBI CHIEF

Two pieces of deadmeat

the horrified reactions of the freaks as they look on

Rick Regis and Kathie Lee are still in silhouette

RICKY

KATHIE LEE

REGIS

and Peace sound like a warm up act

CREW GUY(OS)
Okay We got light
REGIS

The lights come on--no more silhouettes Ricky looks
perfectly normal his old self His weird silhouette was
caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile
behind him

RICKY

REGIS

(TO AUDIENCE)
How bout it folks Lets hear it
for Ricky Coogan

The audience applauds and hoots wildly

KATHIE LEE
Can we bring out the other freaks
now

The audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from

the wings and stand off to the side waving to the audience

They all look clean cut and happy They wear T-shirts with
their former identities printed on them I was NOSEY I

was COWBOY I was the BEARDED LADY etc Except the Worm

whos still a worm His T-shirt says Im Still THE WORM

WORM
Ridiculous Just because a man
doesnt like macaroons

Nonsense

Suddenly a squirrel runs across stage followed by Juan He
pounces and catches the furry little bugger

JUAN
Gotcha Damn its about time

ALL THE EX-FREAKS
(happy to see him)
JUAN

JUAN
Hey guys Jeez You look great

They all hug
REGIS
Thats just great What a story
And what an ending Elijah
transformed by the goop

KATHIE LEE
And he really looked like--

RICK
Exactly like you two I swear
Same faces same outfits except
they had these really big hideous
feet

He looks down at Regis and KATHIE LEEs feet--theyre big
hideous monster feet Suddenly their eyes glow bright red--
Its Elijus and Elly Lee They speak with Elijahs voice

ELIJUS
Shows over Ricky

ELLY LEE
Im gonna drink your blood

Elly Lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on
Ricks throat when

BANG BANG BANG Elijus and Elly Lees eyes go funny

They look at each other spit up some blood wave to the
audience one last time and collapse to the floor Julie
stands behind them smoking gun in hand She rushes to Rick
They embrace

JULIE
Rick Its finally over

RICK
Yes Yes it is
STUEY(0OC)

Rick Rick

Rick and Julie turn and see Stuey still a ten foot tall
monster running towards them Hes carrying a garbage bag
dripping blood

RICK
Stuey
STUEY
Look I found the real Regis and
Kathie Lee

Rick and Julie look at the bag mortified Stuey chuckles

STUEY (CONTD)
No this is just my lunch

Rick and Julie sigh with relief Stuey pulls out a similar
leaking bag and holds it up

STUEY
(matter of fact)
This is Regis and Kathie Lee

Rick and Julie nod casually--Oh

AUDIENCE
Awwww

Suddenly Elijus and Elly Lee pop up from behind the couch
bloodied but still fierce Theyre about to stab Rick and

Julie when

BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG Five more shots ring out
and they fall dead--again

Ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun

ERNIE
Oh like that wasnt totally
predictable

JULIE

Well now it really is over
Sappy END OF THE MOVIE MUSIC wells up

RICK
Thank God You know this
adventure has taught me something
(MORE)

RICK (CONTD)
When man starts impinging on the
subtle perfection of the earths
natural order the only thing hell
create is havoc

ERNIE
Right Coog I learned somethin
too That men and women truly are

equals That the human spirit

transcends gender and physical

appearance and thus it is immune

to the petty degradations men may

devise I believe it was Moliere
WHO SAID--

Julies had enough She socks Ernie square on the jaw

JULIE
Oh shut up
(She turns to Rick)
Lets go fuck

Rick gives her the thumbs up They turn to the audience

RICKJULIEERNIESTUEY MONSTER
Good night everybody

The audience cheers The HIT SINGLE from the soundtrack
album kicks in as we

ROLL CREDITS

As the credits roll and everybody continues to smile and
wave at the cheering audience Elijus and Elly Lee attack
again Ernie hands the gun to Stuey who shoots them dead
Well dead-ish Seconds later after some more waving they
attack again This time Nosey and the Bearded Lady stab them
to death sort of A little more waving before Elijus and
Elly Lee make another pathetic attempt They can barely
stand Cowboy clubs one with a mic stand Worm head-butts
the other A few seconds later Elijuss bloodied hand
gropes its way over the top of the studio couch Stuey has
to prop him up while members of the audience are invited
down
to punch him in the chops Ernie stands off to the side
charging everyone five bucks per blow

As we fade everyones having a go flipping throwing
kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of Americas favorite

morning show hosts

THE END
