INT HONG KONG - SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - DAY
Twenty boys aged 7 to 12 sit at spartan
desks bibles raised FATHER ONEAL walks

and thin lips An awful man
FATHER ONEAL

Sumeria And what happened
to him Francis
FRANCIS 12 is the eldest and largest boy
FRANCIS
Jesus disciples came and
performed miracles When
Simon Magus saw the
miracles he offered
disciple Peter gold for the
powers of God
FATHER ONEAL
What did disciple Peter say
to that Michael Quinn
Father ONeal stands before the youngest
littlest boy who unlike the others exhibits
no fear in his huge intelligent eyes Father
ONeal hates this boy
The boy MICHAEL QUINN doesnt respond
Father ONeal snatches his bible revealing a
SECOND BOOK hidden behind it
Its a dime store pulp adventure with a gaudy
cover entitled THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR
FATHER ONEAL
Answer the question
Michael
The little boy stares up at him
MICHAEL QUINN
Thats not my name
Father ONeal yanks the boy from the chair
Drags him by the arm across the room and out
into the corridor
THE OTHER BOYS wait two seconds then they
spring up and run en masse to the door
Grouped in the threshold straining for a good
view they watch as --
FATHER ONEIL pulls Michael Quinn into an
office down the corridor The door has a
stained-glass window
It begins We see it in SILHOUETTE Father
ONeal with a CANE SWITCH in his hand the boy
beneath him Down the switch comes Again And
again The boy YELPS And again and again and
again and now he SCREAMS
THE BOYS HUDDLED IN THE DOORWAY begin to
wince With every repeated merciless descent
of the switch
INT SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - EATING HALL - NIGHT
THE BOYS sit at benches Michael Quinn stares
stoically ahead The back of his shirt is
striped with blood
FATHER YIN 50s a Chinese Jesuit grim in
black frock and white collar paces amongst
the benches Father ONeal watches from the
side
FATHER YIN
Why one child is born into
a good home and another
into poverty - that is but
part of Gods design All
of you are unwanted put
here because of the sins of
your unwedded mothers The
church has fed you and
educated you Given you a
home A name An identity
Stopping before Michael Quinn he points to a
PORTRAIT ON THE WALL of a stern-faced Jesuit
FATHER YIN
Who is that boy
MICHAEL QUINN
Father Michael Quinn
FATHER YIN
Yes A great man You
ungrateful little cur you
will sit here without food
until you appreciate your
namesake
(to the other boys)
All of you will sit with
him Put lunch away Mr
Fong
MR FONG the orphanage cook wheels a FOOD
CART into the kitchen and locks the door
Father Yin exits followed by Father ONeal
and Mr Fong leaving --
A HUNDRED BOYS staring at Michael Quinn

INT ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
Again Father Yin stands before Michael Quinn
The boys are seated for their evening meal
FATHER YIN
What is your name boy
Silence Michael Quinn stares straight ahead
FATHER YIN
Put supper away Mr Fong
MR FONG wheels the FOOD CART into the kitchen
and locks the door Again a hundred boys
stare at Michael Quinn
INT ORPHANAGE BUNKROOM - NIGHT

clamped to Michaels mouth the others are
wailing on him and outside --

Fathers ONeal and Yin watch through the door
FATHER YIN

Spareth the rod spoileth

INT ORPHANAGE - MORNING

Father Yin grits his teeth staring down at

Michael Quinn whose face is welted Nothing

has changed

FATHER YIN

Put breakfast away Mr

Fong
Again the FOOD CART goes into the kitchen
The Fathers and Mr Fong exit The boys rise
moving toward Michael Quinn Theyre going to
kick the living shit out of him
MICHAEL QUINN
Stop Youll have your
breakfast
Michael Quinn walks to the locked kitchen
door The other boys curious follow
Michael Quinn kneels before the door
examining the lock He looks around On a
counter next to the door are EATING UTENSILS
Michael Quinn picks up A FORK He bends the
forks tines Inserts it in the lock He
fishes around for a second Nothing happens
He pulls the fork out rebends it and inserts
it in the lock again And CLICK the lock
pops
Michael Quinn turns and smiles The boys flood
inside The hungry boys go for the food cart
scooping up eggs and sausage Theyre
ravenous Francis mouth full of sausage
beams at Michael Quinn

FRANCIS

DISSOLVE
TO
They shouldve named you
Simon like Simon Magus the
sorcerer
MICHAEL QUINN
No Simon
(pulls the KNIGHTS
TEMPLAR paperback
from his back
pocket)
-Templar
Suddenly a SHARP WHISTLE The boys startled
whip their necks around MR FONG stands in
the doorway Father ONeal and Father Yin
enter quickly The boys back away from the
food cart
FATHER YIN
Who who did this
The boys look at Michael Quinn Then Francis
speaks
FRANCIS
I did father
And another boy James
JAMES

And another and another I did father They
all say it And the littlest youngest boy
surrounded by his new confederates smiles
slightly His eyes glint

glass against the wall He peers over the
balustrade at the party below Satisfied he
removes his hood ENDING TITLES
This is SIMON TEMPLAR A hard self-reliant
crafty man You should treat him as such or be
very sorry you ever met him It is unfortunate

HEHOFOtCHMAHHHQ

that a man of Templars various talents can be
so lacking How

His journey has been through a tough world and
he has come fast This one gives no quarter
Ever Though his outward self glows with life
he is dead inside

Templar focused utterly steals inside a
corridor

INT NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR

A long corridor with a door at the end on
which is engraved MYAKI CORPORATION At the
entrance secured in a niche is a BRONZE BUST
OF HIRO MYAKI

Templar stops cold A RUG (an oriental runner)
extends the length of the corridor

Templar kneels lifting an edge of the rug
Revealing ANTI -THEFT PRESSURE SENSORS
Templar produces a DARTGUN (the size of a
flare gun silenced with a spool of steel
cable attached to the top) He aims down the
corridor and fires

A STEEL DART explodes from the barrel
spooling out the cable and imbeds above the
door at corridors end

Templar yanks the other end of cable from the
spool He looks around for something to secure
it

TEMPLAR

Sorry about this
He ties the cable around Myakis bronze neck
He hangs from the cable testing it It will
hold He pulls out an aluminum contraption
with small wheels and two handle grips Its A
GLIDER for the cable He attaches the glider
to the cable grips the handles and glides
the length of the corridor
THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR - OVER THE DOOR
Templar bumps up against the door He pulls
his knees up and over the handles of the
glider then flops over backwards hanging
upside down HIS FACE is now right next to the
door handle over which is an ELECTRONIC LOCK
(opened by punching a code)
Templar pulls out a BLACK BOX Its a really
small really powerful computer and its job is
to run through every possible number
combination in about a minute and a half
Templar wires the computer to the lock with
two needlelike ELECTRODE PROBES
He activates the system The little computer
starts running through combinations of
numbers He waits hanging upside down
Meanwhile--

Templar pulls out the box Tosses it to Ilya
Ilya raises the handgun at Templars head
Smiles Try something throw an extension cord
on the ground I guarantee it will land coiled
in several places
Ilya happens to be standing inside one of the
coils of the drills extension cord And this
is not lost on Templar Templar on his knees
grabs the cord and yanks it the coil tightens
around Ilyas ankles His legs fly from under
him and he goes down the gun clattering
across the floor Ilya tries to get to his
feet Templar floors him with a right cross
Templar grabs the box and his backpack and
sprints across the room Ilya gains his feet
and grabs his gun sprints after Templar
INT NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE
Templar runs to the balustrade and climbs atop
it
He jumps clutching the ceiling girder above
Hes going out the way he came in Suddenly
ILYAS HANDS are around his ankles Templar
falls Hes going 12 stories to his death No
His fingers clutch the outside of the
balustrade Templar dangles there looking up
at the sadistic face of Ilya And suddenly

foot against Templars left knuckles

Templar grimacing reaches with his right
hand and pulls the box from his pocket Hands
it slowly to Ilya who reaches over the
balustrade for it
TEMPLAR stuffs the box in his teeth and grabs
Ilyas hand jerking him over the balustrade
Ilya falls 12 stories to his death No he
doesnt He falls one story and miraculously
catches the balustrade there Templar clambers
up again atop the balustrade He jumps to the
ceiling girder Hand over hand swinging like

hair as tall and wide as a bookcase His
name aptly is ZERO The other is middle-aged
and strongly built A high forehead clipped
irongrey hair square jaw and aquiline nose
deep-set ruthless unblinking eyes
This is GREGOR TRETIAK To characterize him as
the John Gotti of Russia is to demean him He
is vastly more powerful

Templar My name is
