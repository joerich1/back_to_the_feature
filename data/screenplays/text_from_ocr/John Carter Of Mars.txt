FADE IN
EXT JUNGLE SKIES - DAY

Endless green lush and wild extends to the horizonas we
soar with two MILITARY HELICOPTERS On a mission

EXT CENTRAL AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY

A COMBAT BOOT splashes down amidst torrential rain It belongs
to CAPTAIN JOHN CARTER of Dev Group the most elite of
special forces units Hes handsome but world-weary A wisdom
beyond his years

He spins at a close sound -- rifle now aimed at a tiny RED
LIZARD who regards him like a visitor from another planet

CARTER
(into radio)
Clear

Three seconds later a DOZEN ARMY RANGERS fast rope into view
all around him at the base of their tethers--

-dropping from the two HELICOPTERS hovering above The CHOPPER
WASH whips the terrain but the rainstorm drowns the sound The
little lizard darts away for his life

A soldier lands next to Carter -- JAMES POWELL all
tattoos attitude rock and roll James Dean with a captains
commission They trade a nod Nice landing

And then watch as a CIA MAN descends on the last tether missing
the clearing crashing through branches and landing in a puddle
on his ass Amused Powell looks to Carter

POWELL
War is hell

EXT VILLAGE CLEARING - DAY

A BINOCULAR POV of a jungle settlement -- a village of huts and
shacks now occupied by members of an AFRICAN REBEL ARMY A
handful of ragtag SOLDIERS one with a Stinger launcher

CARTER (0S)
Ten I can see AK’s RPGStwo Jeeps
with machine gun mounts Intels right
about the Stingers

Carter (lowering the binocs) lies next to Powell hidden at the
jungle’s edge
CARTER (CONTD)
The villagers are being held in a
school house on the northeast edge

POWELL
Take five men from the east and
eliminate every rebel you encounter
I‘1l do the same from the south

CARTER
What about the civilians

Powell doesn’t answer

CARTER

Were here to liberate them right
POWELL

If possible
CARTER

What have you and that spook cooked up
Powell gives Carter a long look

POWELL
Okay You gotta right to know Story
is some gemstone showed up at a London
jeweler’s The CIA got hold of it
Turns out to be a whole new type of
mineral Never seen before Has some
amazing properties Lots of uses
Lasersand other tech stuff They
traced it back to this village Weve
been ordered to locate and secure the
source Everything else is secondary

CARTER
Once again they feed us a phony story
so well do their dirty work

POWELL
Its the job

CARTER
Maybe But I’m still coming in from
the Northeast

Carter starts to head out Powell sighs

POWELL
Bad tactics But we’1ll all go in from
the Northeast Isolate the civilians
first

Powell sticks out his fist Carter bumps it with his fist

POWELL
Still friends

CARTER
Womb to tomb

INT REBEL COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

KABOOM CONCUSSION GRENADES blast through the walis causing a
quartet of REBEL OFFICERS to dive for cover Maps and mineral
samples scatter to the ground--

EXT VILLAGE CLEARING

--as the Army Ranger unit STORMS the village from all sides
SHARPSHOOTERS lay down cover fire as Carter Powell and others
race to cover of mud huts--

--picking off REBELS as‘theyrace into view guns blazing Its
chaotic urban warfare deep in a remote jungle

Carter and Powell advance with care as RAT-A-TATATATA --
AUTOMATIC FIRE eats up the dirt dead ahead A GUNNER in a
thatched-roof tower atop a tribal worship house fires a MACHINE
GUN Carter’‘s on his radio

CARTER
Sniper in the compound

A REBEL JEEP pulls into view from the other direction Two
rebels with Kalashnikovs take a bead on Carter and Powell--

INT VILLAGE HUT

--forcing them to dive inside as mud walls get RIDDLED with

gunfire Holes POP just above the level of their heads Powell

glares at Carter who frowns--
CARTER

What

POWELL
Never say it‘s your last mission
EXT EDGE OF VILLAGE
Carter and Powell dart out another way trading FIRE with the

chasing Jeep Powell takes out the DRIVER and the Jeep crashes
Carter sees the Tower Gunner facing the other way--
CARTER
Cover

--and races for the worship house Powell lays cover fire
INT TRIBAL WORSHIP HOUSE

BOOM Carter blows through the door picking off two REBEL
OFFICERS before they can fire back The building has been
converted into a rebel command post A SENIOR OFFICER starts
FIRING as Carter dives for cover--

--falling amidst MAPS CHARTS and SOIL SAMPLES Massive mounds
of DIRT and CRUSHED ROCK fall around him Geological testing
EQUIPMENT tumbles off tables as GUNFIRE rings out

Carter braces for a shot -- and now sees the SENIOR OFFICER has
his gun to the head of a FEMALE VILLAGER bound in an
interrogation chair The officer SHOUTS threats-—

--and Carter doesn’t hesitate BAM

His shot kills the Officer

Carter springs to the ladder-stairs to the Tower and climbs up
behind the Machine Gunner levelling his rifle--

--as the Machine Gunner whirls on him and OPENS FIRE--

--just as Carter DROPS back through the trap door landing hard
The Hulking Gunner abandons his post and LEAPS through the door
in pursuit With a huge machete--

--and CRASH Carter blocks the machete strike with his rifle
wielding it like a two-handed sword The Gunner CLASHRS again
and Carter parries The huge rebel drives Carter back SLASHING
madly--

--and KNOCKING the gun from Carters hands Carter hits the
deck The Gunner plants a BOOT on his neck just as Carter goes
for his ankle-holstered pistol--

--and the machete comes down just as the pistol goes up--

--and BAM The Gunner falls Sideways

Carter looks to see Powell in the doorway rifle smoking They
both catch their breath exhausted

CARTER
I had him

POWELL
Whatever you say
The sounds of GUNFIRE fade replaced by SHOUTS of “All Secure”
Their unit‘s taken the village They swiftly free the bonds of
the female prisoner-- A ranger arrives on the scene

RANGER
The village has been taken All
civilians are safe and secure in the
school

CARTER
Help her to the others

The Ranger escorts the Woman out Carter picks up MAPS from the
scattered rock samples and equipment

CARTER
Well they were up here looking for
rocks all right
POWELL (0S)
(a strange tone)
Yeah Yeah they were
And Carter turns to see what Powell’s staring at
On the tribal altar there’s a SUNDIAL-shaped totem made of
baked red claywith six gem-sized indentations in it -- empty -
- encircling a larger center indentation
It is filled with an INCANDESCENT FIRE-RED GEMSTONE which seems
lit from within by an otherworldly glow The gem absolutely
takes their breath away
And off their looks of pure amazement
EXT VILLAGE SCHOOL - DAY
ARMY RANGERS cut the locks on the doors--

--as IMPRISONED VILLAGERS spill out bound and blindfolded The
soldiers free their bonds and the villagers embrace them--

--as Carter and Powell watch from the worship house door The
CIA Man arrives storming right past them--—

POWELL
It’s in there Spooky
EXT VILLAGE CLEARING - DAY - LATER

The rain has stopped as HELICOPTERS set down bringing support
personneland more INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES who are rushed
toward the worship house by the CIA Man

At the village’s edge Carter and Powell sit scraping mud from
their boots looking like hell

POWELL
Im gonna miss saving your life you
know

CARTER

Won’t miss saving yours

POWELL
We get home were gonna change our
minds Well take two weeks and want
to be right back in it

Carter smiles Shakes his head

POWELL
What about the private security work
You still thinking about it Us ex-
Dev Group guys can make a lot of money

CARTER
I’m tired of killing

POWELL
But youre so good at it

CARTER
Ironic Isnt it

Another Ranger voice CRACKLES over Powell’s radio--

RADIO VOICE (0S)
Gold Team -- South Perimeter -- please
report

POWELL
We got jungle and more jungle Anybody
needs some send ‘em on over

He clicks off Carter still surveys the jungle
POWELL
I’m just trying to picture you -- back
there in the Blue Ridge building your
little house on a hill without a war to
fight

Carter smiles

CARTER
I‘1l send you a postcard

And suddenly a RUSTLING in the jungle springs them to their
feet Their rifles are ready instantly on alert

and then Carter scanning the trees spots A PAIR OF EYES
amidst jungle foliage

CARTER
Ten oclock

A DARK FIGURE takes off running -- just as Carter sights his
rifle Carter and Powell leap into action

POWELL
Go go go

EXT JUNGLE
The two soldiers CRASH through the underbrush giving chase--
POWELL
into radio)
We’ve got a rebel on the south
perimeter We’re in pursuit
--as they SMASH through huge leaves and dangling vines as the
fleeing FIGURE stays far ahead of them visible only as a
DISTURBANCE in the overgrown jungle
EXT DEEPER JUNGLE
Carter and Powell LEAP a stream as more LIZARDS watch--

--and keep CRASHING through dense jungle running hard and
blind finally bursting through into a--

EXT JUNGLE CLEARING

Where a few VINES hang down just overhead from high trees
They catch their breath listening for movement--

--and then see a RUSTLING in the jungle ahead Then several
yards further And further still Powell starts for it--

--but Carter grabs his arm Powell frowns Carter points to
the vine right beside his head It’s swaying gently while the
rest of the vines are not

Together they grip their riflesand snap them upward--
TO SEE A YOUNG AFRICAN BOY

Clutching the vine twenty feet above them He wears a satchel
and has a handful of stones he’s been throwing Surprised the
two friends hold their fire

CARTER
(in broken dialect)
Climb down we wont hurt you Were
not with the rebels

But the Boy remains clinging scared Powell’s had enough--

POWELL
The hell with this

--as he raises his rifle and FIRES -- snapping the vine --

--and sending the AFRICAN BOY tumbling twenty feet to the mud
He lands on his butt as his satchel spills open and--

SIX MORE INCANDESCENT RED “FIRE-GEMS”

Fall out GLOWING MAGICALLY as if from within Carter and
Powells eyes go wide The Boy gasps then scrambles to reclaim
thembut Powell keeps him at bay

POWELL
Carter

CARTER —
Yeah I see ‘em

Carter picks up the glowing stones with wonderment

CARTER
Your villagedid they tell you to
hide these From the rebels How long
have you been out here hiding

The Boy trembles He looks like he hasn’t eaten in weeks So
Carter trades a look with Powelland puts the stones back in
the boy‘s satchel

CARTER
I want you to take these back to your
people Dont let our soldiers see
them They belong to you
POWELL
Carter what are you doing

Carter hands the grateful boy the satchel

CARTER
Now I want you to tell me something

The Boy nods

CARTER
Those rocks Do you know where your
village found them

Another nod

EXT MOUNTAIN OVERLOOK - DAY

Carter Powell and the Boy push through the foliage to emerge at
an overlook -- with a view of é¢ lush MOUNTAIN RANGE rising into
the clouds Near’the base a JAGGED CREVASSE cuts into the
range like a deep black scar

The Boy is happily devouring a Baby Ruth candy bar as he points
to the canyon and speaks a single African word

CARTER
He says “the cave”

He raises binocs intrigued Powell consults a map

CARTER
Whatcha got on that crevasse

POWELL
It’s not here It’s not charted

CARTER
There was an earthquake around here a
year ago Could’ve opened it up

They trade a long lookas their radios CRACKLE

RADIO VOICE (0S)
Base to Gold Team base to Gold
Teamreport on pursuit

Carter raises his radiountil Powell takes it away

POWELL
Uh yeah we lost that rebelstill
out here searching

(MORE )

POWELL (contd)
Mightve found their supply route
though Gonna have a look May take
some time

RADIO VOICE (0S)
Copy that Good luck Gold Team

POWELL
Thanks Well need it

Powell clicks offand meets Carter’s gaze
EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - EDGE OF CREVASSE - DAY
Carter and Powell trek toward the crevasse hacking jungle

CARTER
We’re taking a look right A look

POWELL
That is the mission

© GARTER
We take a gem it’s a court-martial

POWELL
We take one we take ten I know

CARTER
We don’t even know what they’re worth--

POWELL
Besides killing for

Suddenly the narrow CREVASSE opens up before them A dark
ominous ribbon a crack in the earth Depth unknown

POWELL
We‘ve been doing this for fifteen
years For who our country No NSA
CIA guys like Spooky Their wars
their agendas What are we leaving
this Army with

CARTER
Were alive Theres that

Powell studies the dark abyss with a measured tone

POWELL
You ever seen gems like that How much
land in the Blue Ridge you think one of
them buys Forget private security
work A few of those rocks and we
never have to kill anyone ever again
ll

Carter weighs this Powell pushes the moment

POWELL
Weve been best friends for fifteen
years right

CARTER
More or less

POWELL
How many times before this have I asked
you to break the rules

CARTER
I‘ve lost count

POWELL
So whats one more

Carter laughs Powell holds a hopeful stare

CARTER
Alright but after we find the stones
were going to turn them over to the
brass

POWELL
After I put a few aside for my old age

CARTER
Thats between you and your court-
martial tribunal

INT JUNGLE CREVASSE

Powell DESCENDS on a rope line lowered by Carter He feels his
way down jagged walls scanning a light across the walls - -
spotting flecks of worthless QUARTZ and MICA

POWELL
Lots of rocks -- no pretty redheads

CARTER (0S)
How far down you figure

Powell scans with his light Still only blackness

POWELL
Good goddamn question More rope

Fifty feet above him a silhouetted Carter shakes his head Just
below Powell now spots a series of LEDGES like a natural
staircase He starts swinging himself--

POWELL
There’s some ledges here I think I can
get a little deeper--

--and as he swings the rope FRAYS against some rockbut
Powell grabs hold in time He perches on a ledge--

POWELL
Okay Im gonna unhook--

--and as he unclips from the rope line the ledge CRUMBLES
Powell flails and tumbles plummeting into darkness His
TERRIFYING YELL echoes -- and then abruptly cuts silent

CARTER
Powell POWELL

No response
EXT MOUNTAINSIDE

Carter tears back into the foliage SLASHING at long’ sturdy
vinesand hustling to tie their ends together

EXT EDGE OF CREVASSE

With the vines secured to a tree Carter takes a knife and
carves a STAR AND TWO STRIPES symbol into the tree Then he
backs to the edge of the crevasse His FLASHLIGHT is taped to
his belt aimed downward He takes a deep breath--

CARTER
I‘m coming for you

EXT MOUNTAIN OVERLOOK

Far away Carter disappears into the crevasse Watching him is
the African Boywearing an enigmatic stare

BOY
Goodbye soldier

He crunches another bite of Baby Ruth And he’s gone
INT CREVASSE

Carter rappels through the opening navigating far past the
crumbling ledges and the end of Powells rope--

--and then his light finds the bottom of the crevasse With the
broken end of Powell’s rope And traces of BLOOD

Carter scrambles to the end of his vinesand drops six feet to
the crevasse floor He scans his lightfollowing drops of
bloodto the dark jagged mouth of a CAVE

INT CREVASSE CAVE
Carter wanders through the pitch darkness--

CARTER
Powell Can you hear me

Theres no reply But his light illuminates STRANGE MARKINGS on
the walls -- characters shapes and symbols in an unknown
language Intrigued Carter edges deeper--

--and now his LIGHT picks up a GLINT OF RED He stops still
Ahead through an archway he sees twinkling RED LIGHTS --
dozens of them -- like constellations in the sky

He stumbles closer passing through the archway into--
INT UNDERGROUND CATHEDRAL

A massive chamber a domed room thirty feet high with thousands
of mystical RED FIRE-GEM CRYSTALS in the walls

More MARKINGS coordinates in an unknown language are carved in
bas-relief all around the base of the chamber The room was
clearly built by an intelligencebut whose

Carter marvels circling the room He runs his hands across the
fire-gems They shimmer BRIGHTER to his touch

CARTER
What is this

Then Carter spots something in the middle of the room A
SUNDIAL-type marking in the ground Like a compass charting
both time and space And as he edges closer--

--he kneels to examine it seeing a large DIAMOND-like stone in
the center reflecting infinite facets And as he just barely
touches it with one of his hands--

THE ENTIRE CHAMBER RUMBLES WITH ENERGY

As if ACTIVATED The “sundial” Carter’s kneeling on LOWERS
abruptly into the ground causing a WHITE GLOW to spill out on
instinct Carter scrambles aside--

--and sees the canopy of FIRE-GEMS GLOW BRIGHTER as if
instantly charged They CRACKLE with energy as the HUM grows
deafening and RED BEAMS of ENERGY “connect” linking all the
erystals in a spiderweb network--

Carters astonishedas a SWIRLING WIND begins to build and
the FIRE-GEMS glow hotter illuminating PREHISTORIC FOSSILS in
the walls embedded DINOSAURS and MASTODONS--

--while the dinosaur and mastodon fossils GROW SKIN AND PELTS
and suddenly COME TO LIFE as meanwhile the cavern ceiling
SPLITS APART to reveal the night sky high above--

--and the HUM grows deafening and the GLOW blinding and the wind
now SPINNING at impossible speed as Carter sees--

TIME MOVING BACKWARDS ALL AROUND HIM

As the rock above him retracts and the DINOSAURS clamber
backwards from their eternal resting places and Carters
buffeted body shakes as if it’s being ripped apart --

--in the maelstrom of sound and light and time which cascades
into a sudden SONIC BOOM

EXT DESERT - PREHISTORIC ERA - NIGHT

In a distant angle DINOSAURS watch as a PILLAR OF RED-HOT LIGHT
fires straight up into the universe beyond

SMASH CUT TO
EXT DENSE FOREST - DAY

Amidst a low blanket of reeds and tall grasses RED ENERGY
CRACKLES and SPARKS Angle rises to reveal a circle of
flattened burned grasseswith John Carter unconscious
scorched and battered at its center

Carter struggles up Disoriented and nauseous Confused to see
he‘s no longer in the crevasse cave

He’s surrounded by strange foliage -- blacks browns and
silvers Arid and harsh A jungle yes but nothing like the
one he was in Theres a craggy tree canopy overhead Unnatural
insect chattering and faint avian calls

CARTER
Powell POWELL

He grabs his equipment belt checks his compass Its needle is
SPINNING wildly His GPS readout is blank

CARTER
(into radio)
Gold Team to base This is Carter to
base do you read me Ive lost a fix
on my position

His radio CRACKLES and HISSES with static And then he hears a
different CLICK-HISSSS CLICK-HISSSSS An insect-like purr very
near his right ear

He turns careful and slowand sees a BABY MALAGOR perched on
a reed only inches from his cheek Like a tiny four- winged
pterodactyl It cocks its head curious Even cute

--as the Baby Malagor BARES TERRIFYING FANGS and HISSES--

--and Carter RECOILS instantly disappearing from frame--

AND SLAMS BACKWARDS AGAINST A TREE TRUNK

Eyes shut Carter winces rubbing his skull Back to the tree
he lifts his head to see--

THAT HE‘S FIFTEEN FEET OFF THE GROUND

Straddling a large branch with the ground far below him The
Baby Malagor hasnt moved But it’s twenty feet away

Carter blinks confused

He swings a leg over the branch and lowers himself dangling for
a moment then dropping carefully to the ground

He looks upward at the tree branch fifteen feet up Testing
the thought he crouches lowand then leaps

AND SKYROCKETS WAY PAST THE BRANCH

Shooting far higher -- twenty thirty forty feet -- CRASHING

through branches and flailing for purchase Finally he grabs
hold of one Dangling he looks down--

--and sees the tiny Baby Malagor still observing Intrigued

Carter drops from the tree his hands trembling He crouches
grasping the ground as if afraid to let go

CARTER
What happened to gravity

Chancing it Carter slowly rises back to his full height
Nothing happens He surveys the terrain

EXT EDGE OF FOREST - MOMENTS LATER
Carter comes SOARING from the forest canopy arcing groundward

to land in a crouch Hes breathing hard gauging the distance
he just leaped

CARTER
(incredulous)
What happened to me

He rises to face a rising rock slope He picks up a large shard
of black rock testing its weight To his amazement he’s able
to toss it easily in his hand--

--and then he wheels and hurls it like a discus watching it
PIROUETTE high over the rise and out of sight Somewhere
distant there’s a creature’s throaty CALL of dismay

And off Carters stunned reaction
A MASSIVE HERD OF FLYING MALAGORS

comes SOARING over the rise dozens of them riding the winds
like four-winged dragons Carter dives for hiding as they soar
over the treeswhere the Baby Malagor gives Carter one last
HISS and ascends to join his family

Carter blinks He can’t believe his eyes as he marches to the
edge of the rise for a vantage of--

A SWEEPING MARTIAN LANDSCAPE

Like an African savanna with a shallow marshy pond below which
teems with a panoply of MARTIAN WILDLIFE Bizarre desert
predators the size of dinosaurs

and all framed against a STARSCAPE backdrop with the nearest
planet rising prominentlya familiar ringed planet fills the
sky

CARTER
(stunned)
I‘m dead have to be

Above a nearby rock outcrop he can see the top of a TALL STONE
TOWER It looks man-made His eyes narrow

EXT ROCK OUTCROP - DAY

Staying out of sight of the watering hole predators Carter
scales the rocks for a view of whats beyond

- and sees a great DOMED STRUCTURE built into the hillside
with a glistening egg-shaped dome Its incongruity in the
landscape and softness of its lines suggest that it was designed
and built

EXT INCUBATOR - DAY

Carter jumps to a spire and looks down upon the dome Through
a thick curved transparent roof he sees HUNDREDS OF EGGS four
feet high three feet in diameter with a leathery white shell
Sunlight is refracted through the dome and grows with intensity
providing heat The building’s purpose is clear - it is an
INCUBATOR

--And guarding the entrance are two CALOTS - formidable
ferocious creatures about six feet long as thick as a rhino
with ten stubby legs frog-like heads with three rows of teeth
and tusks jutting from wide jaws One might think of an
uglycute English Bulldog when looking at them but one calot
could eat five Earth dogs for breakfast

Carter hears a GROWL Turning he comes face-to-face with a
THIRD CALOT (whom he will later name WOOLA) Stouter than the
others with an endearing patch of color around one eye it
regards Carter with curiosity

CARTER
Easy boy

Woola GROWLS a low woola-woola-woola and edges a step forward
his eyes flaring with alarm

CARTER
-Im not going to hurt you

as a HUGE SHADOW falls over both Carter and Woola and Carter
realizes that’s what the beast was growling at Carter swallows
hardand swiftly spins--

TO SEE A TWENTY-FOOT TALL WHITE APE

SHATTERING two RIGHT FISTS through the glass of the incubator
dome CLAWS OPENING to snatch its newfound prey--

--just as Carter dives aside and scrambles up -- only to get
BASHED by a hulking hairy forearm as it swings back sending him
COLLIDING through the incubator’s wall -- back outside

The maniacal creature has two legs four arms and a head like a
gorilla‘s Its claws SMASH into two of the eggs instead
hauling out TWO STICKY GREEN FETAL CREATURES The mucous-
covered four-armed blind babies WRITHE and SQUEAL--

--as the White Ape devours them whole gnashing jaws slurping
and swallowingand then turns Carters way

EXT INCUBATOR

Carter grabs his pistol and OPENS FIRE The bullets pepper the
Ape’s chest like BB’s Completely harmless

CARTER
Not good--

He scrambles colliding with one of the dead calots The
animals ribcage is exposed -- and Carter’s able to snap off a
scimitar-like RIB for a weapon--

--just as the White Ape LUNGES for him landing on its mid-
limbs and flashing out its upper claws--

--and Carter LEAPS straight up just missing its grasp to a
perch on the side of the dome Surprised the Ape turns--

--just as Carter takes a desperate jump -- right at it
EMBEDDING the rib in its neck as Carter sails past its shoulder
and lands hard in the dirt tumbling to a stop The Ape HOWLS
MADLY staggered but not killed--

--and LEAPS again out of the enraged animals grasp landing
atop the rock outcrop and racing over its summit--

JUST AS A SECOND WHITE APE RISES 7-

into view to cut him off Even larger and more savage than the
first it BACKHANDS two arms before Carter can react-—-

--swatting him like a fly to SMASH HIM BACK THROUGH THE DOME--
INT INCUBATOR

--and crash-land among the eggs A human throw toy In agony
Carter rolls onto his back To see Woola the calot lying next

to him with ugly but sympathetic eyes

CARTER
You take the big one--

As SMASH The larger Male Ape LUMBERS through the destroyed
entry The Female Ape LIMPS to his side with the calot-rib
still stuck in her neck They thrash the grasses as Carter and
Woola both scamper for better cover--

The Female Ape SCOOPS up an egg bites off the top and sucks out
the fetal creature inside She then CRUSHES the eggshell and
HURLS it at Carter knocking him down--

--and allowing the Male to GRAB him The Male raises him high
in the air opening his savage JAWS wide ready to thrust him
down his gullet-—-

WHEN WOOLA CHARGES INTO VIEW

Taking a flying leap at the Ape‘s legs SINKING jaws in and
wrenching a leg out from under The Male buckles loosening his
grip - and allowing Carter to tumble free

Trapped between them Carter sees the Female blocks the exit
Carter glances to the roof then steels his gaze--

And races at the Female She drops low ready for his charge --
until he plants off an egg and LEAPS skyward

Soaring straight up to the dome’s roof where he hangs onto a
broken girder with one hand dangling right above her wide- open
gnashing jaws--

Carter hangs on by one hand about to fall to his doomand now
opens the other handto reveal a CONCUSSION GRENADE

CARTER
Compliments of the US Army

“a

And lets it drop Right down the ape’s throat

The ape ROARSand then gets silenced as the grenade DETONATES
ravaging the ape with internal injuries from its concussive
force The beast topples to ground dead

Carter falls -- but lands safely in the silvergrass The Male
Ape BELLOWS mournfully HURLING Woola at Carter With a
thundering run he blocks any other escape They’re done for
He BEATS his chest and now CHARGES --

AS SUDDENLY HIS TORSO ERUPTS

With black blood and a GREEN FLASH as if EXPLODING from within
The Ape staggersand then topples revealing--

TWELVE SILHOUETTED RIDERS ON THE ROCKS BEYOND

Like a military platoon except the silhouettes aren’t human
They are THARKS twelve feet tall and four-armed green warriors
adorned in armor and battlements riding THOATS great part-
horsepart-rhino cavalry animals

One among them holds a SMOKING RADIUM RIFLE His gun gives a
steady “recharging” whine The rest await this leader’s
command He is GENERAL TARS TARKAS

The riders descend the rocks approaching Twin tusks curve
upward from their jawbones Hairless heads menacing faces
armed to the teeth with spears swords and rifles

Carter tenses -- he drops his “knife” and opens his hands to
show he means no harm

The Tharks (among them savage scar-faced LIEUTENANT VAXX) all
look to TARS TARKAS the leader awaiting an order Tars
motions for all to lower their guns

VAXX
(to Tars gesturing
angrily)
Loquesh va baresh Baresh ku tain

Tars holds him with a steely look Vaxx falls silent Carter
keeps a surrendering pose but addresses Tars

CARTER
My name is John Carter Do you
understand me

Tars betrays nothing

CARTER
I’m not your enemy I’m lost I’m
trying to find a friend

TARS TARKAS
(intrigued)
Friend

Carter nods warily relaxes Tars lowers his rifle And then
points to his own armor

TARS TARKAS
Thark

Curious Tars dismounts and notes the smashed incubator wall
the destroyed eggs the two dead calots and the wounded third
He picks up the blade fashioned from the rib points at the
white ape and asks Carter

TARS TARKAS
Baresh Baresh ku tain

Getting the gist of the question Carter nods in the
affirmative but moves to the wounded Woola and adds

CARTER
They attacked us We were able to kill
one

Upon hearing Carters English the Tharks look befuddled Armor
clanks as Tars raises a single fingerand presses it to
Carter’s chest A testing touch

CARTER
That‘s right Him and me

Tars nods with some amusement then strides past Carter and
examines the calot’s wound calling to Vaxx who THROWS A SPEAR
at Woola A shocked Carter SPRINGS in the air and SNATCHES it
saving the calot’s life

CARTER
No He saved my life

The Tharks don’t know what to make of Carter’s leap An audible
sound is heard as they look on in awe TWO see it as an act of
aggression LAUNCH spears at him and Carter VAULTS to a rock
avoiding both projectiles

TARS TARKAS
SHENN

Heeding Tars‘s order the warriors sheath weapons Carter nods
his thanks and returns to Woola

CARTER
These boys think youre done for You
want to live Move

The calot “smiles” and gets to its feet Carter looks to
Tars The Thark nods - Woola will be spared

Tars Tarkas remains impossible to readbut something akin to a
smile crosses his faceand he finally signals sharply With a
thunder of armor all Tharks DISMOUNT at once

Vaxx curses lowering his weapons with vengeful eyes directed
Carters way And when Tars turns his back Vaxx kicks Woola --
sent tumbling across the dust

EXT INCUBATORROAD - DAY

The Apes’ bodies BURN and their PELTS are loaded onto thoats
while Tharks are busy repairing the shattered dome

A stunned Carter sits prisoner hands and feet bound by CHAINS
Woolas beside him looking forlorn They watch Tars marching
the scene commanding his soldiers--

--as Carter’s radio on the ground beside him suddenly SQUAWKS
with the sound of GUNFIRE and LASER FIRE as if tuning in an
interstellar war

EXT DESERT - DAY

A DOZEN THARK EGGS hang from baskets and braces carried by pack
Thoatsas Tars Tarkas and his Thark platoon trek across a
seemingly endless hostile landscape

Amidst the caravan expedition Carter sits bound atop a thoat --
a prisoner His tired ragged face looks toward the
horizonand his eyes widen at what seems like a mirage

For from the infinite desert rises a massive METROPOLIS

EXT THE CITY OF THARK — DAY

Nestled in the deep recesses of a dry sea bed lies a crumbling
DOMED city looming over the tiny riders Perched on high are
more MALAGORS Two launch and SWOOP over the caravan helmed by
THARK RIDERS in cockpit harnesses

Tars gestures a signal and the Malagors return to the city
SCREECHING an announcement Soon TRUMPETS sound and a huge
ENTRY GATE is opened’two massive iron doors hauled apart by
lumbering mastodon-sized ZITIDARS

An overwhelmed Carter cannot believe what hes seeing This
is like watching a fairy tale come to life Vaxx kicks Carter
forward snapping him back to reality

EXT INNER THARK - DAY

The caravan rides into a dense warren of reclaimed buildings and
sandstone streets bustling with THARKS Thousands of them
Citizens BOW at the sight of Tars and his warriors who are the
elite of Thark’s military And they CHEER at the sight of the
eggs

Tars Tarkas subtly raises a hand to acknowledge the crowds
acclaim A murmur then ripples as Tharks spot Carter --
regarding him with curiosity and scorn He can only look on
with a mind that’s been completely blown

EXT THARK PALACE - DAY

In the city center a bombed-out cathedral-like building towers
over the rest Once an architectural wonder now a
deteriorating monument to war

At the caravan’s fore Tars Tarkas exchange salutes -- the
crossing of mid-limbs -- with four PALACE GUARDS

INT THRONE ROOM - DAY

A grotesque Thark in a chain-mail cloak TAL HAJUS stands on a
dais with three THARK ELDERS and his assassin mistress SARKOJA
a lovely serpent of a Thark

Hajus spits venom scrawling lines of troop movement on a map
(with three of his hands at once) Doors THUNDER open--

--as Tars Tarkas enters with his senior officers (Vaxx and
Jakkal) The room was once a great library or museum left by
whatever ancient race built the city Overturned shelves
tables and books litter the floor

Tal Hajus ROARS angered by the interruption

Tars hurls the APE HEADS at Hajus’ feet Hajus quiets Tars
calmly drops to a knee The other Tharks do the same

Hajus frowns at the sight of the pale human still standing

TARS TARKAS
(to Carter a command)

Sakk
CARTER
I dont understand-- I don’t know what
you want
TARS TARKAS
Sakk

Tars points to the ceiling Carter still hesitates So Tars
motions to his officers who draw SWORDS and attack him--

--giving him no choice but to LEAP right over them to a high
perch above the doorway Tars BARKS another command His
officers HURL their pikes Carter evades GAMBOLING from one
wall to another flying over their heads Tars BARKS another
command The officers stop Tars smiles looks to Hajus He
can’t help but be impressed

TARS TARKAS
Sakk

He motions for Carter to come down Carter does warily

CARTER
My name’s John Carter from America

Tars Tarkas and Tal Hajus trade a stare

TARS TARKAS
Mak jeddak Lo Jonn-kata Thark

Hajus eyes Carter carefully then sneers a dismissive hand

TAL HAJUS
Thark

BOOM Palace GUARDS grab Carter marching him brusquely from
the room And he believes to his execution

CARTER
Listen to me I’m looking for a
friend You’re not my enemy I mean
you no harm ‘

-and as he resists the guards BLINDFOLD him and hold him
fastand finally headbutt him into submission As his entire
world GOES DARK

INT SANDSTONE QUARTERS - NIGHT

Carters eyes snap open as he bolts up in bed -- a stack of hay-
covered burlap surrounded by chain-mail netting Hes been
stripped to his army shorts

But hes alive

The room glows with FIRELIGHT He sees his washed clothes
hanging from a line He sees a meal left on a table And he
hears a throaty PURRING Woola-woola-woola

Carter turns to see Woola guarding the door licking his wounds
Carter’s eyes narrow

CARTER
Woola-woola-woola to you too

He hears RADIO STATIC from behind him He spins to see an
antechamber where a lithe female Thark SOLA sits on the
floor exploring Carter’s military gear dog tags compass
concussion grenade Shes fiddling with his radio--

CARTER
Hey That‘’s mine Hey

--he runs over and she springs back clutching the radio He
tries to guard the rest of it--

CARTER
Get out of here Go Mine

--but she bows repeatedly submissive He now sees a washbasin
and a cookpit in her room And now realizes

CARTER
You did all this For me

SOLA
Sola

CARTER
Sola

Sola smiles In her hands the radio SQUAWKS to life with
inhuman cries and explosions The sounds of battle She puts
it to her ear Carters eyes widen--

CARTER
What is that What are we hearing

SOLA
Zodanga Lok Helium Dak kavall

She sees he doesn‘t understand So she leads him to a balcony
stepping out to overlook--

THE ENTIRE CITY OF THARK

the broken-domed city teeming with six-limbed green-skinned
THARK behemoths Bustling and training marching in military
formation by torchlight But Sola points to the horizon--

--where it GLOWS with FLICKERS of light abrupt and sudden
fireworks from a distant battle Tiny TRACER LIGHTS are visible
-- some kind of airships The FLASH-GLOW moves in concert with
what Carters radio is tuning in--

CARTER (V0)
Dak kavall she said Dak kavall
(beat)
The war

INT CARTER’S QUARTERS - CLOSE ON NOTEBOOK - NIGHT

Carters sandy bloodstained hands open a tiny military journal
and start to write”“My name is Captain John Carter Dev Group
United States Army I am a prisoner of war”

CARTER (VO)
It was incredible It was impossible
Somehow I had traveled millions of
miles through space and infinite years
through timeand yet war remained
Here Everywhere War

ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Carter writing by firelight Sola is
asleep in her antechamber Woola is asleep by the door

CARTER (V0O)
From that there was no escape

CUT TO
EXT STREETS OF THARK - DAY - BEGIN EXTENDED MONTAGE

Carter emerges followed by Sola and Woola He wears his own
clothes but with Thark touches a makeshift armored
breastplate and Thark DAGGER (which on him seems a sword) He
attracts the stare of all THARKS passing by

CARTER (V0)
The sight of Earth in the sky meant I
was still in the same solar system The
red dust the presence of water to
me that meant Mars or as Sola
called it Barsoom And as for the
MartiansThark was the name -- for
their people their city and as I came
to soon realizefor me

EXT THARK PLAZA -— DAY

Carter and Sola join a CROWD at some kind of public ceremony
The dozen EGGS that were retrieved from the Incubator sit on a
dais with necklaces of GREEN FIRE-GEMS draped across them As
the crystals start to GLOW

the eggs crack open and mewling THARK BABIES emerge
clambering out sticky and new The Thark Crowd ROARS
thrusting pikes and swords high Carter stares stunned

for as the Babies first rise to stand they are handed SWORDS
and PIKES of their own Each then follows a MENTOR THARK off to
a distant “training ground”

CARTER (V0)
This wasnt a society it was a
militia The males females and
children alike And the general whod
spared my lifewanted me to be a part
of it

EXT TRAINING GROUND - DAY

Tars Tarkas stands watching with his senior OFFICERS as the
Thark Babies are taught to fight by their Mentors

CARTER (V0)
His name was Tars Tarkas The rest
feared him and obeyed him Tc him I
was some kind of prize

--45 ANGLE TRACKS the row to find Carter at the end holding
two pikes and learning to defend himselffrom Sola

CARTER (V0)
The strength and agility I now
possessed had worth to him in battle
It was all these creatures valued It’s
what they taught their young from the
moment they were born Strength
Valor Victory

Carter PARRIES two of Solas (half-speed) blows then HOPS the
other two but her fourth arm HURLS a pike that hits him in mid-
air He hits the dirt hard armor dinged--

--and Sola has a blade to his throat She shrugs “Sorry”

CARTER (VQ)
Their training was much as mine had
been Attempt Fail Repeat and repeat
again until you succeed Then repeat
until you excel

INT CARTER’S QUARTERS - DAY

A SLIMY MARTIAN RODENT is placed before Carter on a dinner
plate with a charcoal stick He looks repulsed as Sola sits
across from him with a plate of her own

CARTER (V0O)
The one called Sola remained at my
side From her I began to learn some
of their language

Carter motions to his mouth fearing the worst

CARTER
Eat

SOLA
Tog Jonn-kata toq

CARTER
Jonn-kata toq

He lifts the dripping rodent glop and takes a bite Gray juice
dribbles down his chin He chews grimly

Sola wears an amused look She takes her charcoal stick and
strikes it on the table -- it FLAMES alight She then skewers
her own gray glop with it Immediately the meat COOKS FROM
WITHIN roasting to an appetizing smoky brown

CARTER (VO)
As the days passed I tried to find out
what I could There would be no help
in my search for Powell

INT CARTERS QUARTERS - DUSK

Carter uses a STONE to draw an etching on the rooms wall
trying to depict the crevasse cave for Sola

CARTER
It was a cavewith ted crystals
Rocks -- like this -- but red Vekk

Red With a diamond in the center --
and when I touched it it started all
the crystals connected

He draws connecting lines between the crystals he’s drawn Sola
(and Woola) watches patiently trying to follow

CARTER
If it sent me here it could send me
back right Have you ever seen this
A cave like this

Sola shakes her head Carter looks despondent -

CARTER (VO)
She had no knowledge of a way home Nor
any knowledge of what had happened to
Powell But I would keep looking

EXT CARTER’S QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT

Carter sits perched upon his balcony’s ledge watching the far-
off GLOW of a firefight beyond the mountains He has his radio
listening to STATIC and the faint thunder of bombs

CARTER (V0)
And every night I listened to the
sounds of war There was another
civilization out there -- one even the
Tharks were afraid of -- but who they
were and who they fought remained a
mystery to me

EXT THOAT CORRAL - DAY
CRASH A CHILD WARRIOR hits the ground gored and bleeding

rolling away from a bucking gnashing THOAT -- the Tharks’ half-
horsehalf-rhino razor-jawed pack animals

CARTER (VO)
To the Tharks I was an alien An
oddity a pet But the days turned to
weeks and all the while Tars Tarkas
was watching Testing

Carter and Sola approach the corral -- enclosed by a fence made
of ENERGY BEAMS Tars Tarkas surveys the training

CARTER (V0O)
And I knew my one chance of survival
here was to master their fighting
skills

EXT THOAT CORRAL MOMENTS LATER

An ENERGY GATE retracts with a HUM allowing a very reluctant
Carter to edge in The simmering thoat SNORTS

But Carter studies the myriad scars on the thoat’s backand
instead unhooks his holster belt His blades hit the dust As
Sola and other Tharks trade alarmed looks

CARTER
Easy girl I wont hurt you

The thoat stamps hooves like a bull razor-teeth bared Carter
reaches out a gentle hand--

--and the thoat CHARGES Snarling it lowers its head and
COLLIDES with Carter -- who gets plowed backwards across the
ground -- toward the ENERGY FENCE At the last second he
manages the leverage to PUSH OFF--

--and bolts SKYWARD doing a single backflip then plummeting
down headfirst just as the thoat REARS UP at the fence--

--as Carter LANDS squarely on its back hanging on The thoat’s
enraged Tars has seen enough He BARKS a command to his Thoat
Wranglers who aim HARPOON RIFLES--

CARTER
No

--and wrenches the thoat’s mane to turn her just as the rifles
FIRE The barbs WHISTLE past piercing the dirt instead
Carter hangs on pressed at the thoat’s ear--

CARTER
Easy nowI won‘t hurt you

He strokes its flank in a steady rhythm that starts to calm it
The thoat stops bucking settling down

CARTER
I wont hurt you

till she’s finally at rest Carter rides it over and
dismounts stroking its face The other Tharks look mystified
but Tars Tarkas sagely nods Well done

EXT TRAINING GROUND - DAY

Carter again jousts PIKES with Sola His hair has grown longer
and ragged And this time he out-duels her

CARTER (VO)
Over time the walls of my room became
a comfort The taste of my rations and
the smell of the desert became
familiareven the sight of Earth in
the midnight sky

Carter extends a hand to help Sola up She seems surprised by
the gesture But takes it

CARTER (VO)
And little by little the language of
the Tharksbecame mine
EXT STREETS OF THARK NIGHT
A flurry of activity as five THARK GUARDS race past Carter Sola
and Woola Shouts and cries of alarmwhich we hear Carter
starting to “process”

THARK GUARDS AS AN ECHO (VO)
Lok kalos Slokell Munitions house Intruders

He whirls trying to follow

INT MUNITIONS WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

BOOM Five Thark Guards burst in -- with Carter and Sola -- to
find several dead CALOTS on the ground Crates of weapons have
been smashed open and raided

SOLA
Warhoon

CARTER
Warhoon Whats a Warhoon

Suddenly a BARRAGE OF CROSSBOW BOLTS come whizzing from above
killing three of the guards

Carter and Sola spin to see FIVE SHADOWED SIX-LIMBED FIGURES on
a ledge scampering for a high window Shaped like Tharks but
leaner and even meaner Carter dives for cover--

--as more BOLTS come flying The WARHOON ARCHERS clutch
pillaged BUSHELS of weapons on their backs as they flee--

--so Carter grabs a RADIUM RIFLE and “charges” it expertly
taking a bead on the stone ledge and FIRING

The ledge disintegrates as three of the Warhoons FALL The
other two drop their stolen weapons and flee

EXT WAREHOUSE ROOFCITY WALL - NIGHT

Carter LEAPS through the window in pursuit and GAMBOLS to the
outer city wallwhere he sees two Warhoon Shadows slip away
into the desert night He gets off two GREEN RADIUM BLASTS but
they explode into the sand

INT MUNITIONS WARHOUSE

Back at the window Carter sees the Thark Guards FIRE more
radium blasts into the fallen Warhoons -- killing them (The
Warhoons are skeletal Cro-Magnon versions of Tharks)

The Tharks then look to Carter nodding with respect

THARK GUARD AS AN ECHO (V0O)
Tarkas vedd Sek ott Thark General Tarkas is right He
verras is truly a Thark

And off this admission Sola smiles

CARTER (VO)
Sola was the only one who saw me
listening So she taught me more

INT CARTER’S QUARTERS - DAY

A CRUDE MAP of the planet is spread upon Carter’s bed He and
Sola sit cross-legged before it She’s explaining

CARTER (V0)
Malagors Zitidars Calots Thoats
She told me her people lived lifespans
of centuries I wondered whether I
would too She told me of the Warhoon
raiders they fought And of the great
war beyond the mountains -- between
kingdoms called Zodanga and Helium

(MORE)
32
CARTER (VO) (contd)

And of the fearsome Sab Than the

Desert Prophet the Prince of Zodanga

whod banished the Tharks to this

wasteland nearly one hundred years ago

Carter finds his compass with its lost spinning needle and
holds it up to the map Explaining directions on Earth

CARTER
And through it all she was the only
Thark who ever asked me of my world It
was as if she’d given up on her own

Suddenly there’s a POUNDING at ‘the door Sola rises answers
itto find two stern-faced THARK OFFICERS

Her manner turns graveas she faces Carter

SOLA AS AN ECHO (V0)
Mak tek terra It is your time

EXT THARK PLAZA DAY
rn

Carter’s escorted through a crowd -- another ceremonial
gathering -- toward the dais As the way clears

-he sees Tars Tarkas waiting for him With an officer’s suit
of THARK ARMOR And off Carters shocked look

EXT THARK PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

---he WEARS THE ARMOR standing before the Thark crowd as they
ROAR thrusting pikes and swords high Like a Knight of the
Round Tablehes one of them now

CARTER (V0)

Within monthsI had gained their
acceptance Was it months -- has it
only been months It is the first
thing they teach you in the Army If
you are captured learn the ways of
your enemy Live as they want you to
Win their trust

(beat)
For with that comes the way to escape

Suddenly theres a WILD SCREECH from above All Tharks look up
to see a MALAGOR circling and screaming Two more join it as
their RIDERS shoot RED FLARES into the sky--

--as a LOUD KLAXON sounds a warning cry throughout the city--
--as the ceremony falls apart Tharks hurriedly race through

the streets using mid-limbs as legs to resemble centaurs
armed armored and ready for--

TARS TARKAS
BATTLE STATIONS

(Note From this moment on we perceive all language on Mars --
as Carter does -- as dialogue we can understand )

Tars mounts his own thoat and races into the fray Carter
trails Sola who charges up a PLAZA STAIRCASE to see--

SOLA
Hurry Jonn-kata From the skies We
are under attack

EXT PLAZA LANDING

--several THARKS manning positions astride huge RADIUM CANNONS
launchers w gunner cockpits Aiming skyward at--

A GARGANTUAN AIRSHIP IN THE CLOUDS

Descending from gray cirrus-the craft is -a half-mile long with
an open-deck like a great PIRATE SHIP A dozen “FIGHTER”
ESCORTS zip past it -- as a steady STROBE LIGHT blinks from the
ship’s bow BLACK SMOKE tails from its EIGHTH RAY ENGINES
It’s badly damaged

-and in the streets Tars Tarkas notices His eyes narrow
EXT WAR PALACE COURTYARD

KLAXONS and MALAGORS scream on as Tal Hajus marches an outer
corridor with COUNCILORS as Tars finds him--

TARS TARKAS
My King It is a Helium ship It
signals for help

TAL HAJUS
It is a trap Fire at will

TARS TARKAS
We have not been attacked

TAL HAJUS
General Tarkas Every second you doubt
is a second Tharks die Turn back the
assault
(with venom)
Kill everything on that ship

EXT SKIES ABOVE CITY

On city rooftops great GREEN BANNERS are snapped open like
signals to the Thark Malagor pilots above--

--who SOAR INTO BATTLE gripping their mounted PULSE GUNS as
their Malagors SWOOP up to meet the Helium Fighters--

EXT PLAZA LANDING
--while THARK MARKSMEN fire and the main airship is ROCKED

Only now do the Helium forces return fire -- two FIGHTERS strafe
the city as RADIUM CANNONS on the main ship launch EMBER BOMBS --
which spiral like catherine wheels spitting WHITE SPARKS as

they hit the streets and DETONATE--

--COARSING down alleyways and into buildings cutting down
Tharks in the plaza -- with a bolt ZIPPING right at Carter--

--just as an armed-to-the-teeth THARK races blindly past and
the EMBER-FRAG rips him in two instead Spared by fate Carter
picks up the fallen Thark‘s rifle and runs on

EXT ROOFTOP PARAPET

Meanwhile Tars bounds to where FIXED ARTILLERY is perched --
tractor-trailer-sized CROSSBOWS with coils of rope cables
Operators take aim on the mother craft--

TARS TARKAS
NORTH WALL FIRE AT WILL

--and huge STEEL GRAPPLES are shot into the sky trailing the
taut cable -- and IMPALE the skin of the battleship In mere
moments a half-dozen cables have hold of the ship--

--and their cable coils start to retract Like a whale
harpooned the great airship is pulled toward the city Its
engines GLOW with heat but it can’t escape the cables

ON A ADJACENT PARAPET

Carter scampers to a high vantage across an alley from Tars’
artillery post Tars and co are focused ahead and don’t
notice a Helium FIGHTER soaring at them from behind--

--so Carter LEAPS to an unoccupied RADIUM CANNON turning the
cockpit to take aim up--

--just as Tars spins to see Carters cannon aimed at him--
--just as Carter SHOOTS a BLAST that whistles past Tars and
SHATTERS the hull of the coming FIGHTER The one-man flier
WOBBLES thrown off course and Tars FIRES a second shot
hitting the engine as the fighter EXPLODES

Tars nods a look of gratitude then roars to his men

TARS TARKAS
DEFEND THE CITY

EXT SKIES ABOVE CITY

As the battle rages the airship’s ENGINES and CANNONS are soon
obliterated Like a hooked and netted fish it’s hauled through
the city’s broken dome colliding below rooftops--

--and allowing cheering THARKS to drop onto the ship’s deck
Tars puts his rifle over a cable and SLIDES onto the ship As it
descends into view for Carter--

--to see it TEEMS with HUMAN-SIZED ENEMY SAILORS The only
difference is their RED SKIN They shoot RIFLES and draw
desperate SWORDS suddenly desperately overmatched--

CARTER
(astonished)
They’re human

--by the Tharks who SWARM their deck cutting them down left and
right Carter watches from the rooftop as Tars SLASHES his way
through ten men all by himself

He stares as Tharks rid the airship of every RED MAN hurling
bodies to the ground below

AND AT THE AIRSHIP‘S EDGE

ENGINES FLARE as one HELIUM INTERCEPTOR craft TAKES OFF Like
an escape jet with a shrouded cockpit bat-shaped and sleek--

--it rockets skyward just as Tars spots its flight He FIRES
his rifle and just MISSES The Interceptor SPARKS and SMOKES
as it jets skyward disappearing in the distance--

VAXX OS
General Tarkas

Tars and Carter turn to see Vaxx drag from the ship a SQUIRMING
FIGURE hidden by a rose-colored cloak The captive elbows Vaxx
and slips past him The Tharks LAUGH at the futility of the
escape attempt as the figure runs toward Carter who
instinctively raises his sword to strike--

--as the figure‘s cloak and hood fall away--
TO REVEAL THE PRINCESS OF MARS
A red-skinned raven-haired woman beautiful and strong clad in

fine silks with a bare midriff highlighted by a DIAMOND STONE
in a gold setting at her navel This is DEJAH THORTIS

Carter stops in mid-strike blade held high It’s an angel
before him -- the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen And
Dejah is just as confounded -- to see a man in Thark regalia
Astonished Carter lowers the sword--

Behind him Tars Vaxx and a dozen THARK SOLDIERS have arrived
Dejah scampers up trapped--

DEJAH
General Tarkas -- I’m here for you
Please listen to me Ive traveled to
Thark for you

Tars motions to his soldiers As they brusquely drag her off
she meets eyes with Carter She gets only confusion no glimpse
of sympathy So her eyes harden -- and look away

Tars nods to Carter with genuine respect Then marches off In
his wake Sola appears

CARTER
(still shell-shocked)
Your enemythey‘re like me

SOLA
No Jonn-kata Not like you
(a proud smile)
You are alive

As if on cue EXPLOSIONS ring out from the huge battleship’s
hull sending a FIREBALL of acrid smoke and flames into the sky
framing Tars in a portrait of awesome destructive power
Consumed by the glee of brutal victory the Tharks raise their
swords and fire rifles And Carter can only watch

with both remorse and the fear of what’s to come

CUT TO

EXT MARTIAN SKIES - DAY

Out of the clouds SHOOTS the second Helium Interceptor -- the
lone ship to escape Thark - soaring the sky toward

A CHAOTIC AERIAL WAR ZONE

above verdant green plains where ZODANGAN AIRSHIPS and HELIUM
AIRSHIPS are dueling the skies trying to shift the front lines
of what is clearly a massive war

The Interceptor nimbly dives and dodges low above ZODANGAN
GROUND TROOPS -- tens of thousands deep -- as they exchange
volleys of LASER FIRE with HELIUM ARMED FORCES holding the line
atop a ridge beyond which lies--

THE GLEAMING CITY OF HELIUM

An awe-inspiring futuristic metropolis made of hovering city
sections in a crater valley of rivers and waterfalls

A FORCE SHIELD around the city flickers with ENERGY RIPPLES as
it withstands enemy bombardment Fully under siege

The Interceptor flies in banks beneath a FLOATING PALACE--

The King raises his head grieving done

TARDOS MORS
Then theres still a chance

HELIUM GENERAL
It was madness your Majesty To place
her hope in the Tharks-

Tardos Mors stands using a silver cane Steps to a window to
overlook FORMAL GARDENS where a HOLOGRAPHIC FIGURE in a cloak
stands amidst cherry blossom trees Back turned

EXT FORMAL GARDENS - DAY
The dark-cloaked HOLOGRAM is SAB THAN the young Prince of

Zodanga 30 The lower half of his face is red-skinned with
Maori-like markings The top half is shrouded by a HELMET

He watches the cherry blossoms fall around him and indeed
through him with a wistful sort of stare

SAB THAN
Its a tragedy your Majesty that a
place of such beautymust be
destroyed in order to be saved

TARDOS MORS (0S)
The tragedy is to believe that

Sab Than‘s hologram turnsto see Tardos Mors -- old and tired
Yet his diamond pendant shines Overhead the city’s force
shields SHUDDER absorbing enemy blasts

SAB THAN
You can’t survive Surrender and you
save the lives of millions

TARDOS MORS
But not their future

So you will deliver me the Atmosphere

A HOLOGRAM of Tardos Mors VANISHESas angle reveals SAB THAN
in the flesh turning to a window overlook--

OF THE CITY OF ZODANGA

A TOWERING METROPOLIS OF DARK METAL ISLANDS among smog- clouds
Each island “is supported by massive stilts Its a jungle gym
of Soviet-style architecture -- slums upon slums like a
blackened scab upon the sky’s foul soot blanket

Giant ZODANGAN AIRSHIPS are sky-docked at platforms with
SOLDIERS scurrying to re-arm and re-supply It is clearly a
well-oiled war machineas Sab Than turns to a GENERAL

INT WAR COUNCIL CHAMBER - THARK - DAY

Doors THUNDER OPEN to reveal a court-like rotunda Eight ELDER
THARKS the War Council flank a central pulpit -- where Tal
Hajus slumps in a lazy draconian pose

Carter slips in desperate to find the princess An assembly of
THARK OFFICERS watches as Dejah is brought before Hajus At the
fore are Tars Vaxx and Sarkoja

TAL HAJUS
Princess of Helium How unexpected To
what do we owe the hostilities

Despite the environs shes far from intimidated
DEJAH
Commander Hajus I demand the safe
treatment of my ship’s prisoners--

TAL HAJUS
What prisoners

DEJAH
(pure bitterness)
Youre even more savage than your

reputation

TAL HAJUS
And you more beautiful Enough
compliments

DEJAH

We were a damaged vessel requesting
safe harbor We returned fire only
when provoked--

TAL HAJUS
Lack of wisdom in red men surprises no
Thark

The Thark audience laughs Dejah sees Tars Tarkas doesn’t

DEJAH
We were engaged by Zodangan warships
over the Korus Hills Mine was a
diplomatic mission My destination was
Thark

Theres a MURMUR of surprise among the assembled Tharks Tal
Hajus narrows his eyes as the murmur grows

DEJAH
For decades we have maintained the
entire planets water supply despite
the brutal interference of your Tharks
You know that if not for our scientific
operations there wouldn’t be the
resources on Mars to support a single
life -- green or red

Hajus scowls but doesnt dispute this
DEJAH

Within days my city will fall Only
an alliance will save us both--

TAL HAJUS
Your war with Zodanga is not Thark
concern

DEJAH

Sab Than wants the Atmosphere Plant He
intends to override it

Another MURMUR in the audiencethis one of worry

DEJAH
It provides our air our water our
existence It has run itself since the
dawn of time Is that for one man to
control If it even can be controlled

Hajus gives a dismissive wave Dejah meets the gaze of Tars
Tarkasand now turns toward him

DEJAH
That Plant was a gift from the Orovars
the creators -- beyond our science and
understanding My people have sworn to

protect it--

SARKOJA
You will addressss Commander Hajusss

DEJAH
I address all Tharks

SARKOJA
Ssstrike her Ssstrike her down

DEJAH
(pleads with Tars)
I promise you this is your fight
Tharks once knew the meaning of honor
You were more than thieves and killers -
- until this King--

TAL HAJUS
STRIKE HER DOWN

Its Vaxx who heeds the command He charges Dejah and BACKHANDS
her to the floor Her navels DIAMOND STONE is again revealed
as Vaxx is upon her raising his sword--

--only to have it PARRIED aside with a CRASH of metal that sends
the blade flying from his hands--

--as Vaxx spins to see Carter standing there Sword ready

CARTER
Try again and 1‘11 kill you

The entire council GASPS -- hearing Carter speak their language
Even Tars looks astonished

TAL HAJUS
He speaks Our language

The entire room of Tharks now STANDS drawing WEAPONS But-
Carter stands his ground as Dejah raises herself on one elbow
watching with wide staring eyes

TAL HAJUS
Take the Earth Man away He has no
right in this War Council

TARS TARKAS
But he does my King He is the Thark
who captured her He has the right to
name her fate

TAL HAJUS
The Earth Man

TARS TARKAS
It is the law

Another MURMUR as all wait to see Hajus’ reaction

VAXX (0S)
This is a Thark Then let him die like
a Thark--
Carter looks up to see -- BAM -- Vaxx’s four hands SHOVE him

backwards Vaxx calls to all assembled

VAXX

Carter doesn’t know what’s happening Tars now looks grim So
does Dejah now held captive by Sarkoja

CARTER

TARS TARKAS
You have been challenged Jonn-kata

Vaxx takes a sudden step toward him -- so Carter spins pulling
both his DAGGER-SWORDS defensively--
TAL HAJUS
The weapon is chosen
Vaxx nods smugly And draws his own daggers -- four of them
CARTER

What is this For what

TARS TARKAS
For honor Jonn-kata From this moment
on only one of you may live

Carter meets Dejahs eyes He’s in this for her

TAL HAJUS
I wonder princess How many fools
have gone to their deathsover you

And Vaxx CHARGES Lunging with all FOUR DAGGERS whipping
wildly Carter PARRIES two blows but a third CLANKS off his
armor and a fourth SLASHES his side Carter buckles to a knee
as Vaxx brings his two free arms SLASHING DOWN--

--and Carter dive-rolls forward -- through Vaxx’s legs -- in the
nick of time He looks up to see Vaxx charge again--

--but this time Carter drops into a fighting stance both blades
ready He backs up PARRYING a succession of four blows -- and
when Vaxx swings them in pairs--

--Carter ducks the two high strikes and PARRIES the two low
Vaxx brings the high arms slashing down and Carter parries
those When the low arms strike from the side--

--Carter forcibly splits the held high blades leaping up with a
FORWARD FLIP and landing a SLASH to Vaxxs shoulder Blood
spurts and the Thark buckles

The Thark audience REACTS as Carter lands in a ready crouch
Vaxx spins PIROUETTING TWO BLADES at him--

--and just as theyre about to ROTOR into Carters face he
flashes his daggers up KNOCKING them harmlessly aside Vaxx’s
extra daggers skitter into the crowd

AND VAXX TAKES A ROARING RUNNING LEAP

As Carter dive-rolls forward letting Vaxx land beyond him He
struggles up -- but Vaxx is there He barely PARRIES a blow
only to have Vaxx PUNCH him in the gut

Vaxx SLICES his second blade -- Carter ducks away but another
fist BACKHANDS him to the floor He loses a dagger Vaxx just
has too many arms for Carter to defend--

-as Vaxx stalks forth grinning toying with him now Wounded
badly Carter struggles to crawl away trying to reach his last
fallen dagger--

VAXX
When you choose your weapon Earth
Mannext time choose a gun

And as Vaxx slashes down CROSSED DAGGERS for the final blow
Carter HURLS HIS LAST DAGGER like a point-blank javelin -- with
the same strength hed thrown the Martian rock
44

THUNK Time seems to stop Vaxx stands stock-stillas a
trickle of blood runs from his lips His crossed daggers are
still held at his chest--

CARTER
Next time

--pinned there by Carter’s DAGGER which has run right through
Vaxxs wrists and impaled his heart

Vaxx hits the floor dead The Tharks are astonished So is
Dejah As Carter wearily stands

CARTER
You say I name the princess’ fate

Tars looks to Hajus who grudgingly nods

CARTER
Then I say she lives

TAL HAJUS
(a defiant sneer)
Then live you shall Princess While
we determine just what you are worth
And to whom

With a POUND of his staff the Council is dismissed Hajus nods
to Sarkoja who hauls Dejah away The Thark officers POUND
their own sword-hilts on the ground -- a war-like drumbeat
Dejah and Carter lock eyes

as she’s pulled out of sight The Thark officers keep up the
DRUMBEAT It’s like theyre salutinghim

TARS TARKAS

Come with me

INT VAXXS QUARTER’S - PALACE - NIGHT
Tars leads Carter Sola and Woola into a well-furnished room

TARS TARKAS
Your mastery of our weapons was
expected Your mastery of our language
was not
(a beat)
You are an interesting man Jonn-kata

CARTER
Call me John

Before Carter can ask why squires enter carrying the clothes
armor and weapons of Vaxx

TARS TARKAS
This is now yours

CARTER
(re Vaxx’s possessions)
Shouldn’t this be left to his family

TARS TARKAS
(laughs)
You still have much to learn about
Tharks

Tars and Carter sit at a table as Vaxxs squires bring plates of
strange fruit and vegetables

TARS TARKAS
Eat

Woola comes sniffing for table scraps Carter tosses him a
Martian rodent pats his flanks

CARTER
Run along Woola It’s all right

The calot plops his belly on the floor

TARS TARKAS
“Woola” Why
CARTER
Just something we do back home
TARS TARKAS
You command the calot as you do the
thoats -- without force It is an

interesting tactic
Tars studies Carter eyeing the sword in his hilt
TARS TARKAS
And you use your sword in a most
intriguing way

Tars stands and imitates Carter’s fighting moves but the
actions are clumsy Carter rises and pulls his sword

CARTER
You’re lunging too quick

Carter demonstrates a more elegant approach With an excellent
students observational skill Tars repeats the action with
fluidity

CARTER
Good

Feeling high-spirited Tars moves to a weapons rack and adds to
his other three hands mace ax and shield

TARS TARKAS
I use this when I’m surrounded

With a magnificent display of skill Tars uses each limb with
equal dexterity against an assault by invisible opponents
Stopping he offers the weapons to Carter

TARS TARKAS
You try
Carter hold up his hands - “Only two arms
TARS TARKAS
Sorry

Carter breaks a smile Tars laughs returns the weapons to the
rack and gestures with his two free arms

TARS TARKAS
Grow two more and I will make you
Captain of the Guard

Carter and Tars laugh

TARS TARKAS
Where did you learn to fight

CARTER
West Point A military academy

TARS TARKAS
Where they train in the way of the
warrior It was taught to me from
the moment I hatched
(with some regret)
It is all we learn

Dismissing any temptation to be introspective Tars leans
toward more “upbeat” subjects

TARS TARKAS
Perhaps Perhaps it is well that you
found your way to Barsoom

Carter smiles but he’s not sure

CARTER
(gnawing at him)
I must ask you Tars about the
princess What will become of her

Tars reaches for his stein but cannot bring himself to drink
The joy has vanished From the shadows Sola listens in

TARS TARKAS
(uncomfortable)
Tal Hajus will not honor her request
for an alliance Instead he will sell
her to the prince of Zodanga

CARTER
So she came to you for help

TARS TARKAS
Yes Because Tharks should respect-
honor Yet honor means nothing to Tal
Hajus

CARTER
What will Tal Hajus do

TARS TARKAS
He will Our King he He will
“keep” her before turning her over to
Zondanga

CARTER
“Keep”

TARS TARKAS
He has a “taste” for red women His
decadence knows no bounds

Carter is stunned saddened appalled and quietly furious
Desperate to change the subject Tars rises

TARS TARKAS
Let me show you my rifles

CARTER
(polite)
Tars I’ma little tired If
youll excuse me Ill say good night

Tars knows that he has lost a degree of Carters respect but
replies with equal politeness

TARS TARKAS
As you wish

CUT TO

EXT THARK PLAZA - DUSK

FIERY TORCHES light the gutted looted Helium battleship as
HUNDREDS OF THARKS cut free its tethers But rather than fall
to the ground it instead floats higher Like a great blimp
the behemoth ascends into the sky--

--as the FIRE spreads within it Against a star-scape backdrop
it lights up like a FUNERAL PYRE billowing black smoke and
flame Rising to join the galaxy beyond

EXTINT CARTERS BALCONY - SAME

«as Carter watches from his balcony lost in thought He
turns to see Sola and Woola approach watching the sky with him

In a far part of the palace is a LIGHTED ROOM in a HIGH TOWER
Carter analyzes ledges and other old balconies Sola points to
Malagors patrolling the sky

SOLA
They watch the sky for Helium
airships

CARTER
Then they wont be looking for me
(to Woola)
Stay

Concerned Sola watches Carter JUMP thirty feet to the NEXT
LEDGE Mortar gives way and bricks drop to the street
alerting the Malagors Carter quickly pulls himself up hidden
from view as the Malagors soar past

Dejah watches the burning FUNERAL PYRE tears fill her eyes as
her lost ship drifts to the heavens Alone Dejah begins to
disrobe but stops when she hears

CARTER 0OS
Princess

She spins and covers herself drying her tears For a moment
neither says a word both acutely aware of a subtle yet intense
mutual attraction

DEJAH
There are four guards Right outside

CARTER
Then send for them

He waits She hesitates And curiosity gets the best of her

DEJAH
(with suspicion)
Who are you

CARTER
My name is John Carter Im a prisoner
here as well

DEJAH
You attacked my ship and killed my men
CARTER
I thought you were my enemy
DEJAH
And now you think differently
(beat)

Yet you live among Tharks you wear
their armor you speak their language

He points to the starscape beyond the balcony

CARTER
I’m from Earth The future Im here
by mistake We were lost in a cave --
a friend and I -- and we ended up here
All I want is to find him and return
home Have you seen or heard of a man
like me

DEJAH
No

A weighted beat between them

DEJAH
You believe there is a way back

CARTER
That cave was a portal It was built -
- by an intelligence--

DEJAH
The Orovars
(off his look)
They were the ancestors of all life
(MORE)
DEJAH (contd)
They traveled the galaxies colonizing
planets They built the Atmosphere
Plant that makes Mars inhabitable they
built our canals our cities -- and
then vanished a million years ago If
there’s a portal on EarthI suspect
they built your planet too

Dejah goes to the window where Earth hangs in the night

DEJAH
You say you’re from the future

Carter nods

DEJAH
Does life on this planet survive

Carter hesitates She waits with troubled eyes

CARTER
Yeah Yeah it does

She smiles emboldened

DEJAH
This is why we fight

CARTER
What will happen to you

DEJAH
Tal Hajus will keep me prisoner Red
men are all the same to him He blames
us all for his people’s exile

CARTER
And if I were to help you

She looks up surprised

CARTER
Would you help me in return Your
kingdom has ships communications to
help me search for my friend

Dejah studies his gallant facewith a newfound hope

DEJAH
Beyond this city lie oceans of desert -
- full of Warhoons and worse It will
take days to get to Heliumif it even
still stands

CARTER
I’1l take the chance

DEJAH
And if hes dead If you never find
him

CARTER
Ill have tried

She searches his eyes trying to allay last suspicions
DEJAH
Then tell me John Carter How do we
escape ten thousand Tharks

Their whispering faces are close enough to kissthere’s a
charge in the airbut Carter remains focused

CARTER
By deciding to leave

Carter backs into the shadows and with one last look
disappears over the side of the balcony as Dejah turns back
to the window and allows a troubled smile

CARTER
You stink and you’re ugly but it was
very nice meeting you Now go slobber
on somebody else

The beast whimpers with mournful eyesbut finally slinks away
Carter sheathes his sword and looks skyward With a LEAPhe’s
on the rooftops

Woola immediately turns tail and races the way they came

Woola bursts in chuffing and nuzzling Sola’s sleeping face She
shoots awake -- and sees Carter’s empty bed

Carter scampers the rooftops under cover of darkness A new
perch gives him a vantage of the Palace Tower--

--where a LIGHT is on in Dejah’s high window A high stone
corridor bridges it to the rest of the palace but the tower is
also ringed by a crumbling outer staircase -- beginning halfway
up Directly beneath it is a thatched-roof GUARDHOUSE with a
small CAMPFIRE And two SENTRY THARKS

EXT TOWER GUARDHOUSE - NIGHT

The sentries cross paths then separate allowing Carter to dart
through the shadows between them planting a foot off a supply
box and LEAPING HIGH--

--to grab the lowest crumbling stair He pulls himself up--

CARTER
Close

--and suddenly the STONE breaks apart beneath his weight His
hands scrape the stairs coming up empty eyes wide--

--and he FALLS straight back down SMASH He punches a hole
through the straw guardhouse roof glancing off HAY BALES and
THUMP Hits the ground on his back--

entire head At a SNORT Carter slowly turns

its burning logs within reach With an idea

EXT TOWER - SECONDS LATER

The Sentry Tharks come running just as the straw-roofed house
GOES UP IN FLAMES And in the next instant -- SMASH The
panicked Malagor CRASHES straight through the burning roof
FLAPPING WINGS skyward elevating straight up--

--with Carter perched on its back Skying a pure vertical--

--he comes even with the towers stairs and jumps off He
crouches in shadow unseen by the guards below--

--as the Malagor pumps its wings shrieks and flies off
snuffing last bits of flame from its wing-tips The Sentries
try to smother the mysterious stable-firewhile Carter
scampers a spiral to the high window

Your “kingdom says’ theyll pay any
reward I name Who would be worth
thatamidst a war Not one life Not

(slyly)
Only what she has Or what she knows

You are mistaken

Hajus merely nods leaving the Banth

TAL HAJUS
You reds with your scientific prowess
your knowledge your secrets What
have you ever shared with my people

The princess backs away

You think of us as savages But let me
ask you when the last lakes dry up
when the winter rains ceasewhat will
any of us be but savages

And the ones who survivewill be the
ones who are best at it

Dejah watches Sarkoja pour a decanter of WINE It’s filled with
long and slithering MAGGOT-WORMS

of his claws HURL her back to the bed cutting her--

Valley - it is a safe route to Helium
I will tell them your tracks lead
south

Overwhelmed Carter tries to thank him

CARTER
Tars

TARS TARKAS
Say nothing If ever I see you
again You will die by my hand
A stoic Tars kicks his thoat and returns to the city
INT TAL HAJUS’ BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
ANGLE TRACKS past fallen guards and Sarkoja’s worm-ravaged
corpseto find Tal Hajus As his eyes crack open

INT THARK PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

KER-CHUK Doors crash open as Tal Hajus STORMS in oblivious to
his wounds Thark SERVANTS scamper in tow--

TAL HAJUS -
TARS TARKAS WHERE IS HE WHERE IS--

--and stops short Standing on the map dais hands clasped and
back turnedis Sab Than Scared THARK ELDERS wait

SAB THAN
Tal Hajus You were in possession of
the Princess of Helium And you chose
not to inform Zodanga

TAL HAJUS
I was on the verge -- of sending word--

SAB THAN
That you had her Or that you let her
escape

Sab Than now turns Tal Hajus takes an instinctive step back
as Tars Tarkas arrives in the doorway behind him

SAB THAN
Who is he
TAL HAJU
Lord Prince-- fy
SAB THAN
The one who rides with her
TAL HAJUS
He claims to come from Earth We
captured him many months ago -- in the

Paktar Sea Beds

SAB THAN
And you let him live

TAL HAJUS
(a glare to Tars)
We thought he had worth as a warrior
He is without your technology or skill
but he has power

The Prince of Zodanga marches forth Hajus tenses

SAB THAN
Your people exist at my pleasure When
the war is over you should wish to be
remembered well

TAL HAJUS
We will find her Lord Prince--

SAB THAN
Yes you will
(beat)
Or youll find extinction

Hajus reluctantly lowers a knee bowing and Sab Than strides
past His armor DE-MATERIALIZES turning him into a vanishing
HEAT-MIRAGE at the door Gone

In his wake Hajus rises Stares daggers at Tars Tarkas

EXT MARTIAN DESERT - NIGHT

Wind WHIPS fiercely as A BLOOD RED SUN rises over an endless
sandscape Dunes to the horizon In the distance two tiny
THOATS trudge the sand An injured Carter slumps behind Dejah
deathly weak

DEJAH
(to Sola)
Hes losing too much blood

SOLA
There is no help in the desert Let us
ride without rest for the Saravak Pass
And pray

Sola looks behind them we can see the faint lights of Thark
miles distant across the angry desert night

DISSOLVE TO

EXT DESERT FROM THE SKIES - DAY

A MALAGOR with a THARK RIDER swoops over the desert scouring
for signs of them as it flies over a ragged ribbon of trench - -
an exposed aqueduct ceiling collapsed and long gone dry

It soars on over a contingent of Thark SOLDIERS on THOATS led
by Tars Tarkas A pack of TRACKING CALOTS lead them onhooves
pounding following Carters trail

EXT DESERT - DAY

A fierce SANDSTORM rages as Sola urges her thoat against the
gale Suddenly a feverish Carter FALLS Dejah drops to his
side Hes wracked with sweat and shivering eyes shut

DEJAH
SOLA

Sola scrambles over feeling his breaths rise and fall She
inspects his bandaged wound and then spots some scrub-plant
thorn bushes in the sand battered by the gale--

SOLA
Stay with him Give him shelter And
keep him awake

Sola then forges ahead into the sandstorm -- all alone

INT DESERT CAMP - DAY

A makeshift tent has been put up with Carter and Dejah inside
huddled against the elements Dejah brings a canteen of water
to his lips

and sees around his neck his Army DOG TAGS She reaches
for them tentative Wipes the grime away to read his name

CARTER
(delirious slurred)
I want to tell you the truth

She startles releases his tags His breath is ragged

CARTER
The truthabout the future

DEJAH
What are you talking about

CARTER
This planet doesn’t survive

Dejah trembles unwilling to believe it Carter nods

CARTER
The Barsoom I’ve knownhas no life
You won‘t win your fight
(winces shuts eyes)
I’m sorry

Dejah edges back Then grows resolute

DEJAH
Its the future of all planets isn’t
it Yours too So do you stop
fighting for your survival today

CARTER -
Come with me

Shes surprised His mind is drifting delirium near

CARTER
To Earth
(with reverence)
There’s all the water you could ever
dream of Riversoceans

DEJAH
And is there no war

Carter falls silent

DEJAH
That is the world I dream of

They trade a solemn look Carters fading fastand as he
loses consciousness she tenses clutching him--

DEJAH
Nostay awakestay awake

--and without other recourse presses her lips to his and
kisses him She holds itbut when she looks backhis eyes
are shut She takes his hand feeling his pulse

He’s still alive She then sees his NOTEBOOK poking from his
pocket She opens it up to the first page “My name is Captain
John Carter United States Army etc”

CARTER (VO)
I fought today alongside Tharks I
killed men who were strangers for a
cause I don’t understand or believe in
How it reminded me of home

Still holding his hand as the tent buffets from the storm
outsideshe settles in

INT DESERT CAMP - NIGHT LATER

Where Dejah continues to read his journalas the DIAMOND STONE
at her navel gleams in the dim light

CARTER (VO)
I write tonight not knowing if these
words will be my last A princess of
Mars has asked me to help her And in
return she says shell help me I’ve
no idea if she’s telling the truth But
I have no one else to trust

SOLA (0S)
Princess

The tent flap OPENS SUDDENLY as Sola peers in with armfuls of
cactus branches and an excited look

SOLA
The storm has lifted

Dejah emergesto see that MOUNTAIN FOOTHILLS now loom near
Theyve crossed the desert

EXT MOUNTAIN PLATEAU - NIGHT

A CAMPFIRE crackles as Sola roasts an avian carcass while the
thoats munch on bramble

Meanwhile Dejah spreads CACTUS SLUGS on Carter’s wound They
eat the infection excreting juice and pulling the skin tight
like a LIVING BANDAGEas he winces badly

CARTER
Ow It feels like the knives are still
in there an

SOLA

Don’t touch Let them work Now eat
Regain your strength

She brings food to Carter and Dejah Dejah studies her

DEJAH
Why are you helping us
SOLA
I believe as you do -- that the wrong

Thark leads us Thark children were
once raised by their parents not the
King Now they are taught to kill
before they even know their names

CARTER
And before Hajus it was different

The question stops her She stares off at the landscape

SOLA
My parents’ generation was the last to
mate for love Under Hajus it was
outlawed Those Tharks who resisted
like my mother fled to these mountains
to raise us in secret Until their
hideaways were found

DEJAH
What happened to her

SOLA
She was executed Like all the rest

CARTER
And your father

SOLA -°
He stayed in the city He surely
believes I am dead

(MORE)

SOLA (contd)
But a few of us survived out here
and returned to Thark when we were
grown We blended in Found our place

DEJAH
You‘ve never told your father that
youre still alive

Sola shakes her head solemnly

SOLA
He would not want to know what I had
lived to witness That he is the
greatest soldier for the Thark who
destroyed our lives

CARTER
(realizes)
Tars Tarkas

DEJAH
Your father is Tars Tarkas

Sola regards them Nods Then to Dejah

SOLA
You should never have come you see
Because hes forgotten - we’ve all

forgotten -- whats worth fighting for
EXT MARTIAN DESERT NIGHT

Where Tars stares grimly over the sands He leads a search
patrol of twenty THARKS on thoatsas two Zodangan ASSAULT
FLIERS roar across the sky overhead-

MAJOR JAKKAL
Zodangan search planes Theyve
crossed into our territory

TARS TARKAS
It’s only ours until they want it Keep
searching No rest

EXT MOUNTAINS - NIGHT TO DAWN - BEGIN MONTAGE

Carter Dejah and Sola trek the jagged mountains navigating
treacherous trails Carter gains strength as they go

Approaching a steep climb their thoats falter They wont make
it up the incline The group trades a look -- and Carter
removes the animals’ harnesses and reins--

CARTER
Welcome home You’re free

--and slaps their flanks sending them into the wild

EXT A JAGGED ROCK FACE

The threesome climb The route is precarious but Carter starts
to climb with confidence now with Dejah behind him--

--till her footing gives way and she slips sliding down rocky
scree right past Sola--

--just as Carter FREE-RAPPELS from above her landing below
Dejah and catching her just in time before she slides over a
perilous drop And off their shared grateful look

EXT TOP OF PEAKS - PRE-DAWN - END MONTAGE

Sola scans the route ahead with a digital spyglass seeing
contrails in the sky She motions they should wait

and as Dejah looks for Carter she finds him sitting on a
rock ledge staring at Earth A moment alone

CARTER
Why did he come for you Sab Than He
was willing to fight all of Thark by
himself For you

DEJAH
Not for me

Dejah considersand finally unburdens the truth

DEJAH
For the key to the Atmosphere Plant
It‘s the secret my family is sworn to
protect

CARTER
And what if he’s right What if inside
the Plant there is a way to change the
planet’s fate

DEJAH
If you could give one man control of
Earth -- the weather the tides the

oxygen -- would you Would you trust
that to anyone Is that what its maker
intended

Carter nods muses Dejah holds the stare

DEJAH
We could use a soldier like you
CARTER
This isnt my war

DEJAH
For the fate of the world

CARTER
Your world Not mine

Too harsh Dejah looks away stung

CARTER
I’m sorry

DEJAH
So am I John For the truth I didn’t
tell you
(beat)
Your friend the Earth Man is dead

Carter reacts standing suddenly

CARTER
What are you talking about

DEJAH
The tags you wear around your
neckIve seen them before Your
radio your clothes -- Ive seen them
all They rest in a museum -- in my
city With the skeleton of a man

CARTER
That‘s impossible

DEJAH
The name on the tags is James Powell

Carter stops still
DEJAH

He was found buried in the Paktar Sea
Beds Over a hundred years ago

CARTER
He traveled here ten minutes before I
did

DEJAH

Ten minutes on your planet It is you
who say you traveled through time
(beat)
(MORE )

DEJAH (contd)
In the museum he’s our most famous
exhibit He‘s known as the “Proof”
That there is life on other worlds

CARTER
Why didnt you tell me

DEJAH
Would you have helped me if I had I
said Id help you find him And I
will

She starts toward him

DEJAH
You came for your friend but youre a
century too late

CARTER
I trusted you

DEJAH
I want you to

She reaches a gentle hand he recoils from her touch

CARTER
Red men green men you‘re all the
same You want a soldier for your army
-- to run to fight to kill No one
asks what I want--

DEJAH
Youre not alone--

CARTER
I AM ALONE

A silence Hurt anger and despair
DEJAH
There’s a place for you in Helium --

with my people With me

He meets her eyesand turns his back on her Its all too
much for him She lets her gaze fall

DEJAH
Then may you find your way home John
Carter Where the wars are your own

She walks away Leaving him staring at his distant home
planetforever out of reach

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BORDER RIDGE - DAY

The trio marches on with Carter now far ahead Sola trades a
look with Dejah -- why does he walk alone today Dejah shakes
her head feigns a mystery

and as Sola and Dejah ascend a ridgetop they find Carter has
stopped in his tracks At the gruesome sight of--

TWENTY THARK HEADS ON PIKES

of tall charred wood The BONES of Thark arms and legs hang
like wind chimes from cross-beams Some RHINO VULTURES fly off
cackling It’s like a macabre fence of scarecrows

Beyond the pikes is a dark foreboding trail leading into a
TOWERING PETRIFIED FOREST

Sola stops shaken chilled by the sight

SOLA
The Ohn Tokk Wood Warhoon country

Carter exchanges a look with Dejah

DEJAH
Compared to them the Tharks are
philosophers

SOLA
And compared to a Thark princess you
are a light snack

Suddenly a HORNS ECHO filters up from the rocky valley they
ascended from Carter springs back to the ridges edge
scanning with the digital spyglass--

--until he spots a COLUMN OF THARK RIDERS many miles distant
snaking across a far ridge

CARTER
Riders Looks like a Thark search
party I’d say a day away--
WHEN SUDDENLY--
A terrifying SHRIEK as A FEARSOME SHAPE SPRINGS UP in front of
Carters face He’s knocked backward as he sees the hissing
gnashing jaws of a

WARHOON WARRIOR

--rise from the rocks before him The brute is adorned with
crude ANIMAL-BONE ARMOR and heavily tattooed with tribal
markings and before Carter can react the Warhoon flashes a
STINGER WHIP--

--which wraps around Carters neck choking him Carter aims
his pistol but the Warhoon snaps another WHIP snaring his arm
The gun falls A third WHIP snares a leg -- a fourth WHIP
snares his other leg Sola rushes to his aid--

AS TWO BARBED BOLTS ARE SHOT INTO HER BACK

knocking her down Dejah spins to see FOUR ARCHER WARHOONS
march over the rise beyond the pike-fence with fierce CROSSBOWS
aimed Sola struggles up--

--and four more BOLTS drop her to the dust Dejah rushes for
her sword snaring it and turning--

TO SEE TWENTY WARHOONS APPEAR
over the rise surrounding them in every direction

CARTER
Dejah--

--as he reaches out a hand and she throws him her sword--
--just as the Warhoon swings him with the whips toward a RAVINE
CREVASSE Carter manages to slice three of the whips free
grabbing the fourth and JERKING IT with all his might--
--which sends the surprised Whip Warhoon SKYING over the edge
PLUMMETING into the crevasse to his death Carter scrambles
back atop the ridge--

ONLY TO FIND HIMSELF SURROUNDED

He and Dejah stand back-to-back with wounded Sola trapped
nearbyas the Warhoons close in on them In what they all
believe are their last moments

DEJAH
I’m sorry John Carter For everything

---and as a bittersweet look passes between themsuddenly a
DEEP RUMBLE sounds from aboveand all look skyward to see--

SAB THAN’S BAT-SHAPED BOMBER

Now darkening the sky above as it zeroes in and swoops toward
ground The Warhoons part to clear a landing area--

--as the ship DOCKS amidst exhaust vapor hued crimson by
landing lights A HATCH opens and out march Zodangan SOLDIERS
flanking Sab Than in his magnificent armor
SAB THAN
Dejah Thoris At last

He reaches themand studies Carter

SAB THAN
And you
(beat)
I waited years for you And then I
forgot

Carter stands his ground as the Zodangan Prince now removes his
hawk-like helmetto reveal THE RED-SKINNED FACE OF CAPTAIN
JAMES POWELL Carters in total shock

as Powell grabs him in a forceful embrace He claps Carters
shoulders beaming

POWELL AKA SAB THAN
Beats some pretty red rocks doesn’t
it

Carter staggers looking to Dejah

CARTER
Powell
DEJAH
Your friend The Earth Man No he‘s--
POWELL
A skeleton in your museum That’s the
Zodangan who first found me - in the

desert over a century ago I took his
life and left mine

(touches his red face) -
It’s the atmosphere Carter In time
it’ll change you Extend your life to

Powell nods to a black tribal marking on his throat which
obscures a raised SCAR

POWELL
That fall in the crevasse cut me open
Voice has never been the same
(a wry smile)
Then againwhat has

CARTER
You started this war

POWELL
Like we always said Carter Finally
found something worth fighting for

DEJAH
For murder Youve killed millions

POWELL
This planet dies You know it and know
it Someone had to tell them Someone
had to try and save it

DEJAH
You You will bring its death

She suddenly charges him -- only to be grabbed by Carter Its
instinct He holds her firmly -- and Powell nods a thanks
Dejah looks to Carter with betrayal

POWELL
Where is the key to the Plant
Princess

Suddenly Sola breaks free from the Warhoons and CHARGES and
Powell instantly spins with his radium pistol--

CARTER
James wait--

--as Carter steps in front of Powells gun Powell can’t open
fire Then Carter spins on Sola--

CARTER
Dont Sola Stop Please

--and Sola stops short of her attempted attackas Zodangan
forces now hold her fast Powell narrows his eyes at Carters
actionsand turns back to Dejah

POWELL
Everything you love will dieunless
you tell me where I find the key

DEJAH
Everything I love will diewhen I do

Carter stands conflictedas Powell turns to his soldiers

POWELL
To my ship

They haul Dejah away to the ship Another group hauls up Sola
too Powell regards them rueful

POWELL
Half this planets run by savages And
the other half philosophers This
world was desperate for men Like you
and me

INT BOMBER - POWELL’S CABIN - DAY

Powell leads Carter into a well-appointed room -- with military
charts on tables Plates of food and drink

POWELL
Now as for “James” youll need to stop
with the “James” Its “Lord Prince”
thats how they like it Youll have
your own title too It’s incredible
isn’t it What gravity allows us to
do

CARTER
On Earthit was only ten minutes

POWELL

I landed like you did in the Paktar
Sea Beds They were home to Zodangan
villages then -- the poorest people on
Mars They took me in as one of their
own With my skills I made a natural
leaderand when I told them of their
planets fate the word spread And
more villages started to follow

CARTER
Sab Than The Desert Prophet

POWELL
Imagine it An “Atmosphere Plant”
Imagine all life on Earth run by an
ancient computer - causing famine
floods global warming all of it What
if all that could end If we simply
opened the computer and changed the
program

CARTER
What if it can’t be changed

POWELL
You‘ve spent too long with the
Princess

CARTER
What if changing it destroys the
computer

POWELL
We‘re men of action Carter

CARTER
It’s not our place to play Gods

POWELL
“Play” Gods WE ARE GODS

He roars it with megalomaniacal amusement Carter remains
stone-faced Powell’s smile fades

POWELL
What did we ever fight for on Earth
Religious strife border disputes oil
supplies I’m talking about whether or
not a whole world survives
(a heartfelt plea)
Youre here now We need you

ve CARTER
We need to go home is what we need

POWELL
I’ve been here for one hundred and
thirty years don’t you think Ive
searched There are no portals on
Mars My army’s mapped every mile of
it This is the only home we have
left

He indicates his opulent cabin quarters

POWELL
For fifteen years we fought for
others You’ve never known what Ive
known What its liketo be a
leader To be revered

CARTER
I know now

POWELL
We were looking for treasure John
You cant fault me for finding it

His stare darkens Carter shows no signs of taking his side

POWELL
You’re either with me or against me

CARTER
What happened to you

POWELL
I‘ll leave you to the Warhoons unless
you’re with me

CARTER
I thought we were friends

POWELL
We were But that was a short time in
my life And a very long time ago
(beat)
We’re both Gods here John And if
you’re not with me there’s only room
for one

EXT BORDER RIDGE - DAY

The Warhoons crowd around a bound Carter as he’s escorted off
the ship He strains for one last glimpse of Dejah (thru a
window) as Powells ship closes--

-and off ‘the fear in their eyes-—-

--Carter raises a hand in farewell--

--as Powell steps to Dejah’s side with a sad bitter gaze--

POWELL
Goodbye my friend

As the ENGINES ROAR to life Carters surrounded by Warhoons
with the Leader scrutinizing his featureswith interest And
then a RIFLE BUTT comes crashing down and DARKNESS

CUT TO
INT DUNGEON CAVERN - NIGHT
WAR DRUMS and FIERCE CRIES are THUNDERING from somewhere
-as Carters eyes flicker open He struggles up to find
himself in a filthy cage made from the RIBS of zitidars Inky
black stalactites and stalagmites dot this cavern

He winces at his torn wound which he tears away to reveal an
ugly swollen bruise Its nowhere near healed

Suddenly there’s a COMMOTION ahead Four THARKS in chains
are hauled in by WARHOONS and thrown into a cell

TARS TARKAS (0S)
Some of my best soldiers

Carter spins From the cage next to him Tars Tarkas steps from
the darkness All four of his arms in chains

TARS TARKAS
And all for you

Their cages separate them Still Carter steps back
TARS TARKAS
I swore I would kill you Jonn-kata It
is a promise I will keep

CARTER
What is this A prison

TARS TARKAS
The Warhoons take no prisoners

The WAR DRUMS build in volume Faint screams from somewhere
TARS TARKAS -

What did you want that the Tharks
failed to offer you

CARTER
My freedom Have you never wanted
that
Tars stares darkly
CARTER

I hear you were once an honorable
people Led by more than just shame
and fear

TARS TARKAS
A Thark fears nothing

CARTER
Your King fears everything He
separates children from their parents
so they have no one to fight for but
him He educates his people in battle
alone And he trusts no one who’s not

a Thark
TARS TARKAS
As he never trusted you
(beat)
Unlike me

Suddenly the ROAR OF A THOUSAND WARHOON echoes through the
caves The WAR DRUMS pick up the pace Tars tenses

TARS TARKAS
They’‘re coming

EXT WARHOON GAUNTLET PIT - PRE-DAWN

Four huge WARHOON GUARDS march Carter and Tars up a mine- shaft
incline One of each mans legs are now connected by a ten-foot
chain WAR DRUMS pounding up ahead--

--as they emerge at one end of a football-field pit of LAVA
ROCK Uneven terrain dotted with smoking FUMAROLES and
burbling TAR PITS -- all bordered by towering SPIRES OF BONE
like a giant ribcage rising from the rock

And it’s surrounded by HUNDREDS OF WARHOONS drunk and wild The
event has the rowdy illicit atmosphere of a cockfight -- on a
grand scale A BONFIRE along one wall lights the pit

TARS TARKAS
It‘s called the gauntlet Their idea
of sport

Carter and Tars are positioned inside a NEW CAGE like a
racehorse’s starting gate Theyre flanked by two other “teams”
-- one a pair of HELIUM MEN one a pair of THARKS

TARS TARKAS
If you make it to the other sideyou
live until the next one

Carter surveys the field its divided into three “sections”
each marked with a natural ROCK PEDESTAL at the far edge Each
base has a large BONE-GRATE built into the ground before it
Atop the first pedestal are two SHIELDS the second two AXES
and the third -- a single BROADSWORD

CARTER
And all we have to do is run

TARS TARKAS
You will want to

Suddenly all the Warhoon drums suddenly STOP And in the
silence the Warhoon Leader raises a cudgel and BELLOWS

AS SUDDENLY THE CAGE DOORS SNAF OPEN
And the three “teams” Tharks Zodangans and Carter and Tars are

released into the arena Ahead the first BONE-GRATE unlocks
splitting inward--

AND ALLOWING A PACK OF CALOTS TO CHARGE OUT

hurtling headlong for the teams Nothing like Woola these are
wild mangy and starved as-

--BAM Carter gets DECKED by the Thark team and trampled - his
chain goes taut and Tars hits the dirt Angrily

TARS TARKAS
Such a waste of my training

The snarling wild calots are halfway to them

as the pair of Helium Men hit the calot line - as the lead
Man is SNATCHED up and driven backward His teammate dives low
as the calot leaps over him DEVOURING the first -- and snapping

him free of the linked chain

Other calots COLLIDE with the Tharks who are wrestled down but
Manage to hurl the calots off and run onward--

--while the lone Helium Man scrambles up the first rock
pedestal about to grasp the SHIELD -- only to have his trailing
chain SNARED by a Thark The Tharks pull him back hurling him
aside--

--as Carter and Tars see the ten CALOTS all charging them

TARS TARKAS
To the death show no fear--

--as unseen by him Carter charges at Tars and just as Tars
half-turns his way Carter collides and GRABS HIM FAST--

AND TANDEM-LEAPS INTO THE AIR

SKYING RIGHT OVER the calots to land in a heap beyond As the
ten calots reverse course they scramble up--

TARS TARKAS
Ah Some training after all

--while the Tharks pluck the SHIELDS from the pedestal
triggering the next BONE-GRATE ahead to collapse in--

AND TWO TIGER-LIKE BANTHS CLAMBER OUT

Giant ten-legged carnivores with thickets of razored teeth and
gleaming red eyes They lumber toward the scent of prey

TARS TARKAS
Banths Very bad

As Carter and Tars watch the calots behind them DEVOUR the last
Helium Man the Tharks CHARGE the banths shields ready--

--until the Thark in the rear raises the razored-edge of his
shield and SLICES it across his partners neck His partner
falls The Thark SLICES again severing his ally’s foot--

--and with both shields the betrayer Thark CHARGES the banths
pile-driving them with the SHIELDS and blasting a path through
their snapping jaws Hes past them

And as one Banth lumbers to DEVOUR the helpless other Thark the
second CHARGES Carter and Tars Carter nearly loses his
balanceon the edge of one of the boiling TAR PITS--

TARS TARKAS
Stand your ground

When Carter tries to run Tars holds him firm Alarmed he sees
the Banth lunge at them jaws wide--

--as Tars suddenly HURLS Carter to the right and dives to the
left pulling their chain taut in mid-air--

--as the Banth CRASHES JAWS down uponthe chain Splitting
it Carter and Tars are freed The Banth whirls on Carter who
DIVES and ROLLS evading snapping jaws But the Banth’s TAIL
whips around knocking Carter onto his back

The Banth lunges jaws againand Carter GRABS two of its front
fangs Blocking the Banth struggling in place--

--and then with all his strength PUSHING IT BACKWARDS Like a
blocking sled he edges the Banth toward the tar pit right
behind it The Banth shrieks whipping its tail--

--but it can’t reach Carter as Carter drives him into the
boiling oil sludge tail-first With one last leaping heave
Carter upends the Banth -- BAM -- onto its back--

--and leaps off as the screaming animal gets CONSUMED by the
smoking sludge Carter looks to Tarswho nods approval

Up ahead the lone Thark reaches the second pedestal and the
SPEARS -- which trigger the final BONE-GRATE to retract--

AND A HULKING FOUR-ARMED SIMIAC

climbs from his subterranean cage It’s one of the “Giant Apes”
Carter fought at the Incubator but this one is gray and twice
their size He has dragon-like scales dirty scarred and
feral Hes the Warhoons’ prize fighter

CARTER
These guys I hate these guys

The lone Thark is now armed to the teeth -- with two spears and
two shields He’s ready for the Simiac’s CHARGE--

--and as he hurls his spears PIERCING the Simiac it never
slows grabbing all four of the Thark’s arms and SNAPPING them
off He then grabs the shocked Thark by the torso--

--and shovels him into his mouth like a living hot dog The
Simiac wolfs down the Thark in seconds flat He plucks out the
spears like they’re splinters

--and then his gaze finds Carter and Tars

CARTER
Killed one once didn‘t I

TARS TARKAS
Yes But that was a girl

At the sight of the Simiac the remaining Banth and Calots skulk
away cowering The Warhoon crowd GOES WILD

BACK IN THE GAUNTLET PIT

Carter spies the huge BONE SPIRES bordering the pit an idea
forming He spots the sword on the final rock pillar

CARTER
We‘re in this together aren’t we

Tars says nothingas they lock eyes--

CARTER
I need that sword

--and the Simiac CHARGES Carter grabs the two SHIELDS from the
fallen Thark-limbs He LEAPS ASIDE as the Simiac swipes-—-

--and lands near the BONFIRE WALL bordering this section of the
course Carter dips the shields in a TAR PIT and then touches
them to the bonfire--

--and the SHIELDS are aflame He now stalks the Simiac -- and
as it throws FISTS Carter blocks them with the FLAMING SHIELDS
causing the beast’s paws to catch fire

But the Simiac seems unfazed hurling now-FLAMING FISTS at
Carter Each impact knocks Carter yards backward forcing him
to scramble up His shields go flying--

--as with the diversion Tars has a clear path to the pedestal
He scrambles up grabbing the SWORD

TARS TARKAS
Jonn-kata

He hurls itand Carter leaps landing beside a tar pit and
dipping the blade in tar just as the Simiac’s upon him--

--and Carter meets its flaming fist with the sword -- which
catches the SWORD AFLAME With both hands Carter slashes and
parries fending off the beasts blows--

--and then leaps straight up to eye-level and SLASHES OUT the
Simiac’s eyes with a last FIERY SWING

Blinded it HOWLS stumbling backright into the BONFIRE WALL
Its whole body LIGHTS UP consumed by fire-

--as its arms flail -- BAM BAM -- colliding with one of the
tall bone spiresand cracking it

CARTER
Is that all youve got IS THAT ALL
YOUVE GOT
--and as the dying Simiac continues flailing and battering--
THE CURVED BONE SPIRE CRACKS FREE

Toppling backwards like a tree felled at the trunkto BRACE
against the side of the gauntlet pit Like a ramp out

CARTER
Go go go

Seizing the chance Carter and Tars race up the bone spire--
EXT ROCK BADLANDS - ABOVE THE PIT

--and find themselves on a table-land with a some mangy THOATS
and ZITIDARS tethered to a makeshift hitching post Tars pulls
Carter to a sudden stopand directs his gaze

EXT GAUNTLET PIT - MOMENTS LATER

Furious Warhoons CHARGE OUT of the pit scaling ladders only to
be brushed back by the FLAPPING WINGS of a MALAGOR--

WITH TARS AND CARTER AT THE REINS

As they evade the RIFLE BLASTS of the vanishing Warhoons--

CARTER
Thought you were gonna kill me

TARS TARKAS
First things first

--as they soar ever-higher to give us a new vantage of the

Gauntlet Pitwhere all those bone-spires form the RIBCAGE of a
GARGANTUAN SKELETON A prehistoric MARTIAN WHALE

BACK AT THE PIT’S EDGE

While Warhoons roar with rage they charge across the table-
land -- and then several suddenly COLLIDE and fall back--

--as if they’ve hit something invisiblewhich they have A
RIPPLING HEAT-MIRAGE turns into a ZODANGAN ASSAULT FLIER as its
engines FIRE Two PILOTS have been lying in wait--

ZODANGAN PILOT
Alert the Prince

EXT MARTIAN CANYONS - DAY - LATER

Towering cliffs of rock miles high flank a long-dry
riverbedas the Malagor SOARS through a narrow passwhere
there are ominous STORMCLOUDS on the horizon

-and now the Malagor suddenly SHRIEKS tugging at its reins
Tars struggles to keep it flying level--

CARTER
Whats wrong

Tars’ eyes narrow at the darkening skies

TARS TARKAS
There‘s somethingout there

And as they stare at the OMINOUS CANOPY ahead they watch the
image ripple slightly as if there’s a MIRAGE in frontgetting
closerthe mirage of a small airship

TARS TARKAS
GET DOWN

AND SUDDENLY BLUE RADIUM BOLTS OPEN FIRE

from nowhere The Malagor dives low evading as the ASSAULT
FLIER zips past again MATERIALIZING INTO VIEW--

--as do its two Pilots at the open-air ships controls Their
ship BANKS in pursuit of the Malagor

TARS TARKAS
It is a Zodangan Assault Flier We
will never outrun it We have to get
to the clouds

EXT MARTIAN SKIES - IN DARKENING CLOUDSCAPE

The Malagor SOARS into the ominous clouds wisps of heavy gray
Winds whip harder here buffeting them all

CARTER
Youre taking us into a storm

TARS TARKAS
They will never follow This is no
storm Jonn-kata -- it is where all our

weather starts

CARTER
(in amazement)
The Atmosphere Plant

Tars nods They look back to see the Assault Flier sweep
through rumbling clouds DIVING toward them

CARTER
And theyll never follow huh

The Flier OPENS FIRE -- as RADIUM-BOLTS rip into the Malagor’s
WINGS shredding and smoking them The creature WAILS as Tars
drives it through more clouds--

--as they watch the diving Flier DROP AWAY and disappear into
the gray cirrus below--

TARS TARKAS
Take the reins Pull these to dive --
on my signal

CARTER
What about you

Tars weighs him with a grudging smile

TARS TARKAS
On my signal

He edges out to the Malagor’s wing and spots a GLIMPSE of the
Assault Flier through the clouds below--

TARS TARKAS
Now

--and Carter pulls hard on the low reins forcing the Malagor’s
chin down and DIVE-BOMBING--

--to FLASH RIGHT PAST the Assault Flier as Tars LEAPS OFF--
AND TACKLES THE PILOTS ABOARD THEIR FLIER

to their shock as Tars’ four arms sweep them all overboard as
they PALL THROUGH THE CLOUDS guns firing--

--while Tars just barely manages to hang on to the side of the
Flier which wobbles badly going down--

AS ABOARD THE MALAGOR

Carter loses sight of Tars He’s hit by a GUST of turbulence as
the Malagor WAILS its strength giving out Carter tugs at the
reins but the beast stops flapping--

CARTER
No Hang on C’mon HANG ON

--as they cut through the clouds lower and lower until
suddenly huge DUNES OF BLACK SAND rise up dead aheadand the
Malagor CRASHES to Earth and the whole world goes DARK

EXT MARTIAN VALLEY DAY

ANGLE SOARS above the BLACK SMOKE and RUBBLE that once was a
small Helium farming community Destroyed by Zodanga’s forces
A ribbon of REFUGEES trudges across the land

INT POWELL’S AIRSHIP

as Dejah watches from the window of Powells quarters He
sits in his captain-like chair

DEJAH
Tell me “James Powell” What sort of
man sends his friend to his death
POWELL
You send an entire people Their fate
is sealed - and yet you ask them to
fight
DEJAH

I ask them to follow their conscience
Powell rises and approaches her as she presses

DEJAH
For millennia our meager resources
have been shared among us all
(MORE)

DEJAH (contd)
We‘ve rationed and conserved And then
you arriveto say no such sacrifices
must be made
(beat)
Despite the fact you have no proof

POWELL
I will Once I have your key

He stands close She holds her ground

POWELL
Wherever it’s hidden you will tell me
The war ends the moment you do

He reaches for her hand raises itand presses his lips

POWELL
I taste blood on them princess

He exits leaving her alone at the window She stares out again
at the column of refugeesand places a hand to her stomach
lifting the edge of her clothes--

-to reveal that the gold royal crest that pierces her navel is
empty The inset DIAMOND STONE is gone

EXT MARTIAN ASH BADLANDS DAY

STORMCLOUDS surroundwith FLASHES OF HEAT LIGHTNING on the
horizon as amidst dunes of VOLCANIC ASHrests a dead Malagor
half-buried

From beneath one of its wincs struggles a battered ash-
covered Carter But he’s alive He surveys the clouds

CARTER
Tars Tarkas TARS TARKAS

But only wind HOWLS back So he crawls up the dunewhere he’s
confronted with a black desert vista

EXT ASH BADLANDS - DAY - MCNTAGE

From a high vantage Carter trudges ahead through FIERCE WIND
and SWIRLING BLACK ASH -- is90ssibly harsh conditions The
THUNDER is ominous and constant

He keeps struggling onward as FORKS OF LIGHTNING connect with
an ash dune peak in the distance

In the midst of the tempest he falls to his knees bracing his
body pounded by SWIRLING °4as he starts to crawl forward
hand-over-struggling-hand

EXT ASH BADLANDS - DAY - END MONTAGE

Carters eyes snap open battered by the gale Hes collapsed
from exhaustion And yet a mere few yards ahead

THERES A SINGLE BLUE FLOWER

poking out of the ash Weakly Carter pulls himself toward it
and as he reaches for the flower-

--his hand passes through a curtain of ashto touch the flower
on the other side Where the air is still

Carter drags himself forward through the weather “curtain”--
TO FIND HIMSELF IN A FIELD OF BLUE FLOWERS

In a grassy expanse utterly calm and towering above him--
IS THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT

A GIANT COLUMN of twisting white clouds rises three miles into
the air from it feeding the very atmosphere of Mars Its like
the eye of a hurricane Storm winds swirl all around it but
here -- on the inside -- all is calm The sheer metal edifice
‘has no doors no windows No way inside

Awestruck Carter staggers to the wall of the building -- which
covers four square miles and towers two hundred feet He sinks
to the ground exhausted

CARTER
The whole warover this

He laughs ruefully delirious from his trek His laughter
convulses his body -- he winces holding his wound And then he
keels over The wound is really hurting him now--

--and as he looks down he sees a STRANGE GLOW coming from his
side like a hot coal inside his skin as his- scar starts to
split apart His flesh grows WHITE HOT--

AND A WIDE BEAM OF BLINDING LIGHT

SEARS out from his side “projecting” on the wall of the plant
like a CURTAIN OF ENERGY which causes a DOOR-SIZED SECTION of
the wall to RIPPLE INTO VIEW--

--and then the section of wall VANISHES as if it were never
there revealing a long silver corridor

And the BEAM OF LIGHT cuts off leaving a WHITE HOT INGOT in
Carter’s side as it slips free out of the wound--

--to reveal itself to be Dejah’s DIAMOND STONE It hits the

ground and cools all its energy receding
Carter stares in complete amazement

CARTER
The key

INT SILVER CORRIDOR

A long hall with another RIPPLING “DOOR” at the end It’s like
an airlock -- between a space where the laws of physics apply
and another where they dont

And as Carter walks through clutching the “key” in his
handhis WOUNDS mysteriously heal his skin is CLEANED of
ashand his limping gait becomes strong and sturdyas he
passes through the beckoning “ripple”--

INT ATMOSPHERE PLANT

--into the plant itself He finds himself on a balcony
overlooking a METROPOLIS-SIZED EXPANSE OF MACHINERY It extends
for miles ahead miles above and miles below

And as he turns to where he expects the “door” to be he finds
it extends for miles behind him

A VOICE Welcome John Carter

Carter spins back to see a TINY OLD MAN in a cloak inches away
from his face seemingly hovering above the machinery chasm
Hes impossibly aged nearly mummified but with a slightly
enlarged head and featuresand white skin

CARTER
Whoare you

THE OROVAR (V0)
The one who remained
(beat)
On all our worlds there is always one
who remains

Carter reacts incredulous The man’s mouth has not moved He
speaks telepathically

THE OROVAR (VO)
I am the last of the Orovars

The little man hovers before him Expressionless

CARTER
Youyou run the Plant

THE OROVAR (VO)
It runs itself I merely stay

CARTER
Why

THE OROVAR (VO)
In the event we ever must come back I
must let the others know That Mars is
safe That life goes on
(beat)
It is the same with your planet Earth

CARTER
You know where Im from

The Orovar nods sagely

CARTER
What else do you know

THE OROVAR (V0O)
That you wish to return

With that the Orovar waves a slow hand

With a familiar HUM a TRANSLUCENT PEDESTAL rises from the
depths of the plant -- until it’s level with their platform
Then a CANOPY OF RED FIRE-GEM CRYSTALS shimmers into view all
around it -- just like the portal chamber in the cave

THE OROVAR (VO)

Our pathways were never meant to be
discovered Our worlds should never
have crossed

With another wave a HOLOGRAM WALKWAY like a shimmering plank
appears -- from the platform to the pedestal

CARTER
Is thatmy way home

THE OROVAR (VO)
Your way is of your own volition

He motions Carter onto the holo-walk Carter takes a step --
it’s translucent and shimmering but its solid
CARTER
I dont understand If you Orovars can
create worlds create lifewhy don’t
you interfere With the fates youve
set in motion

THE OROVAR (V0)
It is our science

CARTER
And your planets areexperiments

THE OROVAR (V0)
That we may one day know the essential
natureof whatever intelligence
created us

Carter advances nearing the portal But then

CARTER
What will happen if Powell takes over
the Atmosphere Plant

THE OROVAR (V0O)
To attempt to control it will be to
destroy it

CARTER
Then you’11 stop him

THE OROVAR (VO)
One does not stop an experiment

CARTER
Youll just stand by Youll just
watch this planet die

The Orovar stares patiently As if dealing with a child

CARTER
I helped start this war You know
that It’s my fault he’s here

THE OROVAR (VO)
In science there are causes There is
no such thing as fault

CARTER
Someone has to tell him That all this
can’t be controlled Someone has to
stop him

Carter stares at the diamond stone in his hand

CARTER
What if the key remains inside the
Plant

THE OROVAR (VO)
It is one It is not the only

CARTER
Goddammit Don’t you know whats
happening There’s a war out there
and millions are dying Why won‘t you
involve yourself

THE OROVAR (VO)
Why wont you

He speaks without judgement Carter despairs looks to the
portal The beckoning crystalsthe way home

CARTER
And would I survive Would she

The Orovar says nothing

CARTER
I‘m one man What can I do

THE OROVAR (VO)
Yes John Carter Forever and always
That is the experiment
With a heavy sigh Carter sets his jawand steps to the
pedestal The crystal canopy begins to GLOW and a HUM rises
The Orovar lifts a farewell hand

The HUM grows deafening The crystals BLAZE RED And Carters
conflicted face is bathed in a BLINDING GLOW

EXT ATMOSPHERE PLANT - DUSK

The field of blue flowers is serene and stillas a pair of
BOOTS step out from the plant Carter emerges

and turns to see the Orovar in the RIPPLING “doorway”

CARTER
Never leave a man behind

The little man hovers with a faint smile on his face Scientific
interest Envy Pride

THE OROVAR (V0)
Look to the southwest skies

And then the “doorway” turns opaqueand is a wall again

Carter turns to the “curtain” of weatherstarting to regret
his choiceand now stares skyward hearing faintly

TARS TARKAS (0S)
Jonn-kata are you out there CAN YOU
HEAR ME

EXT ASH BADLANDS - IN THE SKIES

Amidst the stormclouds the Zodangan Assault Flier HOVERSwith
Tars Tarkas at the helm He struggles to control the ship as
his SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the dunes--

--and now illuminates Carter rushing into view waving arms to
signal With amazement Tars broadly smiles

EXT EDGE OF BADLANDS - DUSK

From the STORM CLOUDS the Assault Flier SHOOTS away flanked by
flares of LIGHTNINGwith Tars and Carter aboard

Tars turns to see Carter staring at the receding storm

TARS TARKAS
What happened to you back there

CARTER
(a distant stare)
I saw my future

Tars turns back to the flier’s controls smoke pours from its
underside as the engines STRAIN

TARS TARKAS
Why did you come back

CARTER
I saw a friend in trouble

TARS TARKAS
Afriend

Tars frowns as if it’s a word he’s only heard about

TARS TARKAS

I have ten thoats Jonn-kata you may
take your choice from among them and I
will accompany you to the nearest
waterway that leads to Helium

(off Carters look)
Tars Tarkas may be a cruel warrior but
he can be a friend as well

CARTER
And what happens when you return to
Thark without me

TARS TARKAS
Death possibly or worse
(beat)
Is this not a choice “friends” make

CARTER
Why do you fight for him

The great Thark stops Something registers

TARS TARKAS
A soldier follows orders

CARTER
From the Thark who killed his family

Tars eyes narrow suddenly

CARTER
I know about her General How she
kept your name a secret How she died
to save you and your child

TARS TARKAS
Noyou know nothing

CARTER
I know you once fought for her You
once fought for love

TARS TARKAS
YOU KNOW NOTHING

CARTER
I heard the story from your daughter
herself From Sola

Turning toward him Tars suddenly stops as if shot
CARTER
She’s a prisoner of Zodanga -- along
with the princess She believes in a
better way for her people

TARS TARKAS
Sola

Tars wears a distant dark stare

CARTER
On my planet armies march for flags
and leaders But we fight for our
family and our children I know of no
greater honor than that

Tars looks as if he‘ll kill Carter then and there But instead
he turns away

TARS TARKAS
I have orders Jonn-kata To return to
Thark

CARTER
Then we go together

Tars stops Looks back

CARTER
And you can watch one more life end for
you

Tars turns away and stares over the bowat another Helium
FARMING SETTLEMENT below -- all skeletons and scorched earth
now

And off the dark look in Tars eyes
EXT CITY OF THARK - DAY

The Assault Flier SOARS across the desert Atop a city wall
CANNON GUNNERS draw a beaduntil they hear a distinctive Thark
HORN And now see Tars Tarkas at the helm

INT WAR COUNCIL ROTUNDA DAY

The War Council is in session with Tal Hajus slumped in his
central pulpit An elder Councilor is speaking--

THARK ELDER
But my King the desert wells will not
sustain us And Zodanga refuses us
fair rates of trade--

TAL HAJUS
Tharks will survive We have always
survived Let the red men slaughter
each other and we will remain--

Suddenly the doors THUNDER open as a Thark GUARD races in--

THARK GUARD
A Zodangan ship--

TAL HAJUS
A war council is in session--

THARK GUARD
It is General Tarkas

A MURMUR in the room Hajus’ face fallsas suddenly a THOAT
rides right in to the council chamber with Tars Tarkas and
Carter his prisoner Tars dismounts hauls Carter down--
--spilling him to the floor hands bound before the council

TARS TARKAS
He is found

Hajus scowls to see Tars alivebut hides his displeasure

TAL HAJUS
Then let us have his execution
CARTER
I demand the right to speak
TAL HAJUS
(to Tars)

Cut him apart First his tongue
Tars hesitates Tal Hajus eyes’ narrow with suspicion

TAL HAJUS
General Tarkas--

TARS TARKAS
He is still a Thark Last words are
his right

Hajus glowers feeling the stare of the War Councilors

TAL HAJUS
Speak Then you die

Carter slowly stands and facesthe Thark audience

CARTER
Soldiers of TharkI’ve been one among
you I’ve fought shoulder to shoulder
Youre a brave people and you love
bravery but is that all Tal Hajus
dreams of war -- of carnage and
suffering While you true warriors
dreamof an end to it all

(turns to Hajus)

You’ve made your people into an
arsenal not an army

(MORE)

CARTER (contd)
Youre merely weapons that kill --
without asking what youre killing for

TAL HAJUS
For Thark

CARTER
Which Thark Who Tell me just one
name One Thark whose life matters
more than your own

All await his answer And he has none

TAL HAJUS
What “one Thark All of Thark Only
a child would mourn the death of just
one Thark
(to Tars rages)
Enough Tarkas Kill him NOW

But Tars doesn’t move His eyes are on Carter’s

TAL HAJUS
I SAID KILL HIM

So Hajus himself draws four BATTLE AXES and LEAPS DOWN from his
pulpit only to have Tars step in front of Carter

TARS TARKAS
I demand Justice

An astonished gasp from the room

TARS TARKAS
I challenge you

Hajus stares stunnedas Tars pulls his own four swords The
whole War Council is watching

TAL HAJUS
Here is your death -

And Hajus charges

Their weapons CRASH together with thundering two-armed swings
It‘s a meeting of veteran warricrs -- despite Hajus corpulence
hes a worthy opponent They strike and spin powering steel
against steel--

--as their multi-limbs bash the BLADES back and forth Hajus
charges like a wild bull keeping Tars off-balance He fights
like a Thark possessed unbowed by any HITS that Tars lands
He’s starting to wear Tars down--

--and KNOCKS three of his swords from his hands with a ROARING
sweep of his axes Tars now holds a lone sword--

--and now glances to Carter remembering their “fencing” lesson
Tars takes a balanced stance--

--and as Hajus gleefully CHARGES for the kill Tars moves back
on a single axis PARRYING all four strikes with only one of his
own Hajus’ last lunge leaves him off-balance--

--and Tars now ATTACKS lunging forward moving Hajus back on
his heels seizing an opening SWEEPING his sword--

--and he CUTS OFF the King’s head The rest of Tal Hajus slumps
to the floor

A shocked silence in the room

Then Tars turns to face the assembled THARK OFFICERSand as he
does they all kneel For him now

Tars regards the elders of the War Council They bow their
heads in deference too

THARK COUNCILLOR
It is Justicemy King

Finding Carters eyes Tars gets a nod of gratitude and respect
And Carter kneels too

CARTER
We await your command

EXT GATES OF THARK - DAY

Tars Tarkas clambers atop the ruined gates where HUNDREDS OF
THARKS have assembled with more coming as news of their new
King spreads There’s excitement in the air

-and from around a corner a calot comes running at full-
speed just as Carter turns in amazement-—-

CARTER
Woola

--as Woola alive and well tackles him to the ground slurping
him with a grotesque tongue Hes streaked with SCARS from the
radium bolt But loyal and overjoyed

CARTER
Yeah okay okay -- Im happy to see
you too yeah all right

And as he struggles up Tars address the growing crowd

TARS TARKAS

Soldiers of Thark Our planet has long
been dying yet forever have the Tharks
survived And forever more we will
But only if Zodanga falls For they
fight for a fantasythat will destroy
us all

(beat)
The peaceful people of Helium shall
never defeat Zodanga alone nor will
we but togetherthere is hope

He trails off surveying the stone Thark faces No signs of
like minds But still he tries

TARS TARKAS
Tharks have never made alliances and
this is not our war I will not
command you to go However any Thark
who volunteers

He looks to Carter below in the gateway

CARTER
well take him

A moments silence and then one of Tars’ senior officers Major
Jakkal steps up beside Carter

MAJOR JAKKAL
We will take him

And then a boyish young Thark Captain joins the group

THARK CAPTAIN
We will take him

-and now the words start to spread into the crowd like a
rallying cry as swords are lifted

THARK SOLDIERS
We will take himWe will take him We
will take himWE WILL TAKE HIM

And as the cries build to a deafening THUNDER with swords and
pikes thrust into the air Tars meets Carter’s eyes

EXT ZITIDAR MOSQUE - DAY

THARK RIDERS on thoats Tars paces before them with Carter and

War Councilors nearby

TARS TARKAS
Our city alone will‘be no match There
are six other tribes of Tharks amidst
the desert You must enlist as many as
you can

THARK COUNCILLOR
They have never fought under a common
flag my King

TARS TARKAS
It is not a flag they will fight for

He spins back to the contigent of riders bellowing

TARS TARKAS

Tell them Tars Tarkas will be the first
into battle With or without them

For he would rather fight and die then
to wish that fate upon his children
Tell them the great city of Thark
fights for no flag but for our mothers
and fathers our daughters and sons
MAY WE ONCE MORE PRAISE THEIR NAMES

He raises high his swordand the riders SPUR their mounts
galloping off with vigor and purpose

EXT DESERT BEYOND THARK

The SIX RIDERS gallop out of the city gates immediately fanning
out to ride in different directionscharging and vanishing
into six furious clouds of sand

EXT WAR PALACE PLAZA

Carter Tars Jakkal and other officers stride into the plaza to
see A THOUSAND THARKS standing in formation

TARS TARKAS
March them for Helium by the Kabar
Pass Save your best fifty for me We
take the Old Canal Road

JAKKAL
But that leads to Zodanga

Tars nods to Carter then addresses his officers

TARS TARKAS

INT CASTLE ZODANGA - WAR ROOM - DAY

officers and soldiers are busy with maps and screens -- of LIVE
IMAGES of the Assault on Helium Its patchwork force shield is
severely damaged The bombardment is relentless

-and on the rooms bridge level Dejah sits prisoner watching
the destruction’ with tears in her eyes To the side sits Sola
heavily chained and flanked by GUARDS

POWELL
How much more death are you willing to
witness princess

DEJAH
One

She stares daggers Powell smiles thinly He motions to a
TECHNICIAN who brings up on-screen images of three floating
Helium AIRSHIPS apparently taken captive

POWELL
We captured these refugee ships en
route to your polar outposts Tell me
what I want and I will spare them
(beat)
Where is the key

Dejah watches the screen says nothing This destroys her
POWELL
(to an Officer)
Detonate

On screen one of the refugee ships EXPLODES Two remain

POWELL
Where is the key

Dejah shuts her eyes A tear rolls down her cheek

POWELL
(to the Officer)
Detonate

On screen the second refugee ship EXPLODES One now left

POWELL

On Earth there was once a great war --
a war for the whole world Do you know
what it took to end it The death of
innocents Of whole cities And if
thats what Mars requires

(firmly)
I only take your lives to save them

More tears roll down Dejah’s face Powell turns to his Officer
to give the last command when--

SOLA

Silence

Powell stops He studies the look that passes between themas
the revelation dawns

POWELL
You know
(incredulous)
The Thark knows

Sola looks wary Dejah glares a look of resolve
POWELL
Tell me the keys location Thark
and the princess lives

Powell draws his sword and puts it to Dejah’s throat

DEJAH

And off Powells astonished look
EXT OUTSKIRTS OF ZODANGA - GROUND LEVEL - DAY

A Zodangan FLIER passes on patrol as Woola pops into view
from a ROCK OUTCROP He surveys the distant thicket of “stilts”
reaching high into the noxious clouds--

--and woola-woola-woolas that the coast is clear to Carter Tars
and the fifty-Thark STRIKE FORCE laying in wait Tharks unfurl
TENTED CAGES atop two ZITIDARS--

--to reveal MALAGORS inside A way to reach the skies
EXT SKIES OF ZODANGA - MOMENTS LATER

Among the stilts four Malagors SOAR into the clouds -- each
ferrying ten Tharks faces shielded by scarves--

TARS TARKAS
Do not breathe until we are past the
red men’s poisons

--and Carter presses a scarf over his face too as they enter the
PLUMES of GRAY and BROWN

INT WAR ROOM - SAME
Where Powell now approaches Sola with the sword

SOLA
Jonn-kata was hurt in our escape When
the princess tended to his wound she
placed the stone from her royal crest
inside it
(looks away)
She does not know I saw her

Powells stunned He marches to Dejah and rips her silks aside
to reveal the gold mounting at her navel Empty of its diamond
stone

DEJAH
You had your key

POWELL
You entrusted this planet to him

Hes ready to strike her -- then spins to his officers

POWELL
Send ships back to Warhoon lands Talk
to every single savage and find the

DEJAH
What makes you so sure he has one

EXT CASTLE ZODANGA - IN THE SKIES

Amidst the THUNDEROUS deployment of further troops -- unseen and
whisper-quiet -- the Malagors ASCEND to castle level--

--encountering a trio of LOK-WING GLIDERS on patrol but before
the shocked Pilots can sound an alarm Thark ARCHERS shoot them
from the skies

The Malagors land on the parapets of Castle Zodanga as the
Thark strike force leaps off and slips into the shadows With
Tars Carter and Woola among them

INT WAR ROOM —- DAY
Powell stalks toward Dejah

POWELL

There was a time I envisioned a future
for us Princess A peaceful union of
our cities You and I side by side

(beat)
But I learned one thing on Earth Peace
is the time between wars Its never
the end in itself

He draws his sword as he’s almost there

POWELL
Were at war Princess You are my
enemy This is your end

And as he raises his sword high to strike her down--

CARTER (0S)
Princess of Helium

Powell spins to the far doors to the war roomwhere Carter
stands alone radium pistol aimed right at him

CARTER
Your mission is accomplished

The entire room of officers and technicians is momentarily
frozen One man Alone And then they watch as Tars Tarkas
step to his side And then two more Tharks And then ten And
as Powell realizes--

POWELL
THARKS

THE FIFTY THARKS COME STORMING IN

From all entrances causing INSTANT CHAOS They slash SWORDS
and throw SPEARS -- four at a time -- taking down the Zodangans
who scramble for guns

Carter FIRES and Powell dives aside Dejah tries to run but
Powell LEAPS across the bridge level and grabs her--

--as Carter LEAPS in kind up to the bridge level while
Zodangans and Tharks BATTLE it out on the level below Powell
has Dejah held before him as a shield--

POWELL
Her life for the key Carter

Sola’s two guards have pistols drawn aimed at Carter Carter’s
pistol is on Powell And Powells sword is at Dejah’s throat
It’s a standoff

POWELL
Her life for the key

Carter wavers and then retrieves a small POUCH--

DEJAH
NO JOHN

CARTER
Release her first

POWELL
The key first

They stare each other down as Carter relents and tosses the
pouchas Powell hurls Dejah aside -- but backwards -- into the
arms of his guards Powell snares the pouch--

DEJAH
NO

--as it opensand out falls a US Army CONCUSSION GRENADE
Powell’s face falls as he immediately spins and LEAPS--

--as the grenade DETONATES propelling his “leap” with double
force smashing him into the screens of the War Room Dejah

Sola and the guards are all thrown backwards--

--with Sola blown off the bridge level down to the technical
area where the ZodanganThark MELEE is in full force--

--while Dejah is blown into a deorway She scrambles up and
runs with the stunned guards in pursuit--

--as Carter springs up FIRING at Powell who GAMBOLS to a high
catwalk as nimble and agile as Carter -- and he’s gone Carter
looks back to the Tharks--

TARS TARKAS
Save the princess Jonn-kata

--and so he races for the exit corridor--

--while Tars SLASHES on with Tharks swiftly taking control of

Carter stands in the doorway A modest one-room cabin Dust
and broken furniture Abandoned due to the war

CARTER (VO)
Of a life perhaps lost forever

He looks again at the DIAMOND STONE around his neck
INT MOUNTAIN CABIN - TIMELAPSE - DAY

The cabin is furnished now As we PICK UP Carter at a desk by
the window again writing in his journal

CARTER (VO)
What Id lived through had changed me
I was no longer like other men The
years would pass and they would
diebut I did not

ANGLE PANS to the window and the Shenandoah Valley below and we
see a TIMELAPSE VERSION of over a century of progress Paths to
roads horses to cars hamlets to cities

CARTER (VO)
The lifespan of that other world had
followed me here

(beat)
On this planet I now live as a
stranger

And as ANGLE COMPLETES THE 360 PAN back to the room it’s now a
modern-day HOME Decorated in an astronomy theme Charts of the
solar system Telescopes And drawings of Thark Helium and
Dejah

asS ANGLE returns to Carters desk The seat is empty The
journal sits there And now a DOOR opens in the bg and a
FIGURE marches in crossing to the desk--

CARTER (V0O)
But still I believe There is a way
back And one dayI will find it
A way for someone to answer my call To
my love my friends my home

--and sets down a “Washington Post” newspaper dated 2005 as
it’s thrown open to an interior page

as a HAND circles a minor story in the bottom corner
headlined “74 Earthquake Ravages Central Africa”

EXT AFRICA - MOUNTAIN OVERLOOK - DUSK

A FIGURE in modern adventurer’s gear stands at a familiar jungle
overlook gazing off with binoculars at a lush mountains with a
small black SCAR now in its side

CARTER (VO)

I wont tell you where I’m going I
won‘t tell you how to follow But I‘1l
leave behind my storyfor anyone who
wants to know what ever happened to
Captain John Carter

The figure turns to reveal Carter -- over a hundred years

later and yet he hasnt aged a day The DIAMOND STONE hangs
around his neck He tucks it under his shirt and has a last
bite of a Baby Ruth candy bar

CARTER (VO)
I believe in a better world A world
without war A world of peace

and then heads for the mountain Into the jungle With the
MOON hanging brightly high above

MATCH DISSOLVE TO

EXT HELIUM - VALLEY OVERLOOK - NIGHT

Where EARTH hangs prominently in the same position blue and
brilliant and mysterious

being watched by silhouettes standing all together Tars
Tarkas Sola Woola And Dejah Thoris

CARTER (V0)
For I know in my heart I know

And now Dejahs SILHOUETTE edges asideto reveal she’s holding
the hand of a SILHOUETTED LITTLE BOY

CARTER (VO)
my future’s waiting

And as a triumphant soundtrack FANFARE rises we--

CcuT TO BLACK
