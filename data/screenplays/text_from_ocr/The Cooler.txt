The one working nickel slots next to
the Paradise I spoke to Shelly
earlier he wants her at the tables
The floorman nods walks off Bernie makes for the

rowdy
gaming tables Takes his time about it His approach
brings
an ill-wind to the area The players appear to sense
it
Its in their reactions A slight hesitation of the
dice
Fingers tensing over a pile of chips A hand tugging at
a
tie
The Cooler has arrived
As he reaches table eleven Natalie intercepts him with
a
short glass of Chivas Regal
NATALIE
This is you right

Thanks
NATALIE
Joe said I should stick around You

Bernie just smiles at her
NATALIE
Wow That was fast Hey thanks
She offers up a smile It jump-starts those dormant
eyes
Her whole face comes alive Notches her up from an
eight to
a ten Bernie immediately glances away Hes afraid
what she
might read in his gaze
BERNIE
Dont mention it
Bernie gestures her over to table eleven Immediately

fist to the wall then stops himself Hes just not the
confrontational type

Instead he heads over to the TV cranks the volume up
hysterical moaning from the snake ritual now blends in

Natalie has an astrological chart in front of her In
between

sips she makes annotations to the chart

NATALIE

Your Progressed Venus is Gemini
125 Degrees and is in Direct motion
Which tells me that youre a slow
starter when it comes to romance

(off Bernies taken

aback expression)
You know what This is real
unprofessional of me I shouldnt
discuss your chart with you until
Im all done I can tell by that
look you think this is alla lot of

BS

BERNIE
No I just know what the outcomes
going to be

NATALIE

The outcome Theres not like one
particular outcome A lot of things
enter into it The planets moon
phases

BERNIE
The outcome wont change with me
Itll be all bad

NATALIE
God I have never met anyone who was
so down on themselves I used to be
down on myself OK I dont go there

Natalie cant help but smile

Bernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the

Bernie and Natalie sit eating breakfast

BERNIE

After I get out I call up Shelly

and he tells me to come out here I
figure hes going to set me up good

at the Shangri-la But he tells me
they got all these rules about casinos
employing felons So he gets me this
gig doing telemarketing for one of
their fronts -- trying to scam
pensioners out of their retirement

money

I lasted two weeks
As Bernie talks Natalie spies a very PREGNANT GIRL
(20s)

coming out of the restroom Her eyes follow the girl
back to

a table where a YOUNG MAN (20s) waits on her

BERNIE

Already I was getting in deep
Finally it got so bad I had to beg
Shelly to take on my markers around
town That just bought me more time
to keep losing I put Shelly in an
awkward position I understand why
he did what he did

(taps his knee)

NATALIE
He did that to you What he shot
you

BERNIE

Baseball bat
(off her cringing
expression)

I got off easy

NATALIE
Thats getting off easy

BERNIE
I was out of control

NATALIE
But he maimed you

BERNIE

Let me tell you something Im
grateful for what he did

(off her stunned look)
No kidding Every time I get an urge
to play off the clock -- to so much
as drop a quarter in a slot -- I
reach down and squeeze whats left
of my cartilage Its one helluva
reminder

NATALIE
Jesus I thought stuff like that
didnt happen no more Like that was
just in the movies or something

Before Natalie can respond we hear the pregnant girl
to moan out loud The waitress rushes over
PREGNANT GIRL

Oh shit I think Im going into labor
The young man at the table rushes her to her feet
her toward the exit in a dramatic fashion All this
paying the bill
As they pass by Bernie and Natalies table the girl

An easy mark

BERNIE
Yeah Easy mark You never heard
that term

Natalie shakes her head

BERNIE

When we were kids Shelly and me we
used to work Coney Island during the
summer When a guy would walk up and
seemed eager to open his wallet we
would always mark him with chalk
Wed pat him on the back or arm with
the chalk Like Hey buddy good
job

(pats Natalie)
Meanwhile he had no clue the other
guys saw him coming a mile away
Easy mark

Natalie looks down at her shoulder where the man patted

her
She brushes it for effect Bernie smiles They take a

Natalie locks onto a little toe-headed BOY being
dragged
around by his OLDER BROTHER and the brothers FRIEND

She tears her eyes away from Bernie Bernie cant
believe

what hes hearing That she wants to be invested in
him

What could be so bad

NATALIE

I gave my son up for adoption I
just wanted my life back I was
seventeen going on eighteen and I
was selfish My family they didnt
want to have nothing to do with me
after that So I hitched a ride out
here Figured I could make it as a
showgirl Ten years later

(shrugs starts to

break up)
I like to think that if it happened
when I was older -- with some guy I
cared about -- maybe things would
have been different I think about
my Little Joe And I do know hes
better off Im convinced of that

She lowers her soda Turns to Bernie He studies her
fora

lengthy beat stoic features She wipes away her tears
Oh
