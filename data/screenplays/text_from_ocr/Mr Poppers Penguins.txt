BLACK END TITLES

Fade back in on the
FLATIRON BUILDING

From afar Through a snowy haze Little bundled people on the
street

And into frame stepsMR POPPER (he’s 40--don’t call him
Tommy anymore)

This is no snow globe but a busy Manhattan rush hour Car
horns BLARE The first blizzard of the year has made things
even crazier than normal

But it doesn’t faze Mr Popper who strides confidently
between the traffic in a well-tailored suit completely
focused as he enters the building

INT FLATIRON BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Popper’s assistant PIPPI a small high-strung woman stands
before a group of LAWYERS and PRESS

PIPPI
Pellegrino Perrier

Popper strides in

PIPPI (CONT’D)
Mr Popper

MR POPPER

Alright Let’s make a deal
(someone’s missing)
Where’s Gremmins
Pippi leans in and whispers

PIPPI
The present owner is a bit
perturbed Perhaps

Popper’s already on his way out the door

INT FLATIRON BUILDING - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Popper bursts in Pippi trailing This is one of the awesome
triangular offices in the Flatiron Sits right in its apex

His back to us an older man GREMMINS peers out the window
into the storm and city beyond

MR GREMMINS
I want to stay here
MR POPPER
Me too When this is my new hotel
I’m going to request this very
suite

MR GREMMINS
You know what I mean Popper I’m
not ready to sell the building

MR POPPER
The numbers are there for a sale
(to Pippi)
Let Mr Gremmins see the
PIPPI
Presentation

Pippi hands Gremmins a binder

MR GREMMINS
Who’s she

PIPPI
Pippi Peponopolis I’m Mr Popper’s
personal assistant

MR POPPER
She doesn’t even know she’s doing
it

PIPPI
Pardon

Gremmins barely looks at the binder sighs

MR GREMMINS
Forget the numbers There are
tenants who’ve been here for
decades

MR POPPER
Exactly Old failing businesses
There’s a guy who sells beepers on
twelve The McCain campaign
headquarters is on seventeen Half
the building’s behind on their
rent You can’t afford not to sell

MR GREMMINS
But a hotel The Flatiron Building
was--
MR POPPER

(tosses the presentation)
One of the world’s first
skyscrapers Built in 1902 by
Daniel Burnham it’s like someone
took a Renaissance palazzo and
stretched it 22 stories high A
beautiful piece of living history

Gremmins is impressed Popper continues brutally honest

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
But inside it’s dying I’m not
going to sugar coat it Here’s
what’s going to happen if you don’t
sell Your tenants will continue to
default on their rent The bank
will foreclose You’1ll lose
everything and they’1l be out on
the street

MR GREMMINS
Maybe a little sugar coating would
be nice

MR POPPER
Sugar rots your teeth It’s time
you stopped dreaming and woke up--
because the bed you’re sleeping in
is teetering on the edge of a
cliff

On Gremmins’ face What will he do

INT FLATIRON BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A flashbulb as Gremmins and Popper shake hands a big smile
on Popper’s face

INT THE POPPER GROUP OFFICES - LOBBY - LATER

Follow Popper as he strides into his headquarters Pippi
giving chase

PIPPI
That was particularly painful

MR POPPER
You think that was painful Wait
‘til he finds out it’s a total tear-
down
PIPPI
Pardon

MR POPPER
Don’t worry We’ll keep the same
basic feel of the original
(then)
It just won’t be a triangle

PIPPI
Popper--

MR POPPER
I’m sorry but a rectangle fits
twice as many rooms
(matter-of-fact)
Moving on Next

Popper continues into his sleek modern office

INT THE POPPER GROUP - POPPER’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Popper’s top exec team is gathered

MR POPPER
Tavern on the Green This is the
big one people A large footprint
inside Central Park Are you
kidding This could be my magnum
opus Wow me Stevens

STEVENS Popper’s COO and right hand man stands beside a
large something covered by a sheet

STEVENS
You’re gonna want to sit down

Popper sits on the edge of his desk

Stevens removes the sheet to reveal a model of a massive
modern luxury tower set in Central Park

STEVENS (CONTD)
Tower on the Green

MR POPPER
I love it

Popper stands next to the model It’s huge

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
Maybe a little taller
(then)
(MORE)
MR POPPER (CONT’D)

If they call put ‘em through

INT AMANDA’S HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

A small kid-friendly home BILLIE six and cute-as-a-bug in
a little tutu is practicing her ballet steps for Amanda her
sweet earthy mom

AMANDA
That was awesome Billie Youre
gonna knock ‘em dead at the
recitial

BILLIE
I dunno It’s one thing in the
living room butin front of all
those people

AMANDA

underwear I bet that the principal
has an outtie

BILLIE
(laughs)
Ew

Amanda tickles Billie grabs her backpack

AMANDA
Cmon Your dad’s gonna be here any
minute Where’s your sister Janie

INT JANIE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Amanda sticks her head in the door to find JANIE (15 and
pretty in a nerdy-girl way) sitting on her bed crying

AMANDA
Janie What’s wrong sweetheart
Your dad’s coming

JANIE
(through the tears) Just what I
need

Amanda sits down next to her and Janie cries on her mother’s
shoulder

EXT AMANDA’S HOME - SAME TIME

A cab pulls up in front of Amanda’s brownstone Popper jumps
out and walks for the front door

MR POPPER
Hang tight I11 be out with my

MR POPPER
(hasn’t a clue)
Of course I know

INT AMANDA’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Popper and Billie enter Janie’s crying Amanda comforting
her at the kitchen table

Janie looks away Popper sits beside her

MR POPPER
What’s goin’ down sad clown

Janie rolls her eyes

BILLIE
Janie’s sad because she likes this
boy Cooper Keegan and he was dating
this girl Madison for like two years--

JANIE
Billie shut up

BILLIE
But then they broke up and he
texted Janie that he liked her but
then when she saw him in third
period he didn’t even--

JANIE
Billie Shut Up

BILLIE
(slipping it in fast)
And Janie’s never kissed a boy

Popper leans in Speaks gently with his trademark tact

MR POPPER
Janie relationships are really
tough When you put your heart out
there it often gets stomped on

JANIE
Was that supposed to make me feel
better

MR POPPER

No That’s life Trust me men are
idiots but 15-year-olds take the
cake Once you’re in college then
Maybe give it a shot--

Janie storms out Billie goes after her sister

AMANDA
Great job Dr Phil

MR POPPER
I’m sorry Amanda But I’m not
gonna fill her mind with fairy
tales

AMANDA
Look maybe it’s best if we just
take a pass on this weekend

MR POPPER
What No I don’t wanna miss a
whole-- She’s just a little

emotional right now I’m sure once
some time has passed she’ll see--

AMANDA
She’s a person Thom A teenage
person Do you get that

(MORE )

AMANDA (CONTD)
And frankly I’m getting tired of
having to force my daughter to
visit her own--

Popper is perhaps wounded by her words Amanda sees

AMANDA (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I shouldn’t have said
that

MR POPPER
You know what You’re right They
should stay here this weekend
(then covering)
That way I can set up the big
surprise I’m planning for Billie’s
birthday party over at my place

AMANDA
(dubious) Really

MR POPPER
Really Take care Amanda

Popper gives Amanda a peck on the cheek maybe a bit of a
spark still there

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
(sweetly)
You know I don’t have dinner
plans

AMANDA
I have a date

MR POPPER
Another fix-up

AMANDA
Yes actually My friends seem to
think your ex is quite the catch

MR POPPER

one wouldn’t shake her hand

AMANDA

AMANDA (CONTD)
(off Popper’s look)
It’s thoughtful

MR POPPER
Wellgood luck

She smiles and walks him out the door

AMANDA
Goodbye Popper

EXT AMANDA’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Popper steps out the front door and EXHALES crushed the
first real sign of a chink in his armor Lumbers into the
cab

CAB DRIVER
Just you

MR POPPER
Yeah Just me

As they go Popper looks back longingly at the house as it
fades into the distance

EXT MR POPPER’S CONDO - LATER

The sun getting low in the sky DARYL the chipper young door
man greets him

DARYL
No little ones for the weekend Mr
P

MR POPPER

There’s still some sadness to Popper But he tries to put a
smile on it

MR POPPER (CONTD)
But that’s okay Got the new
Charlie Chaplin collection to
watch Eight DVDs of a man so
funny he could get away with having
Hitler’s moustache

INT MR POPPER’S CONDO - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Popper steps out of the elevator and down the hall to his
door Just as he’s unlocking his door a neighbor KENT
passes Not a fan of Popper Carries a wilted little plant
Sad looking thing

MR POPPER
Nice ficus

KENT
It’s dead I don’t get any light
on my side

MR POPPER
Oh really

Popper swings open his door The beautiful orange-pink rays
of the setting sun shoot out

KENT
Yeah that’s why I wanted the H
unit But somebody outbid me

MR POPPER
Honestly it’s a nuisance I have
to wear sunglasses inside You’re
better off

Popper shuts the door quickly behind him Kent tosses his
plant down the incinerator chute

INT MR POPPER’S CONDO - LATER

The condo is grown-up in decor A wide-open modern two
story loft with stained concrete floors and lots of frosted
glass and stainless steel Black and white photos of great
architecture

Popper’s iPhone has several messages He hits play on the
first as he grabs a bottle and begins to uncork it Over the
speakerphone

MITCH VAN GUNDY (ON SPEAKER)
Popper it’s Mitch Van Gundy From
Tavern on the Green I’ve been
talking to mother about your
interest and well I think she’s
close

Popper’s eyes grow wide He hurries back over to the phone

MR POPPER
Yes--

But before he can get to it the next message plays An older
man’s voice Pained

OLDER MAN (ON SPEAKER)
Tommy it’s Reginald Call me
(a heavy beat)

As Popper’s joyous look turns conflicted

Reginald gives Popper a reassuring look Then continues

REGINALD (CONT’D)
And to my little Tommy I’ve sent

been so long since the sombrero

Popper just shuts his eyes

INT MR POPPER’S CONDO - LATER
Glimpses of a quiet weekend alone

-- He meticulously wipes down his stainless steel fridge - no
pictures or kids’ art or anything else is posted on it

-- He researches Tavern on the Green A beautiful restaurant
within Central Park

-- He sits in the tub working on his Blackberry

-- He watches Chaplin’s The Great Dictator It’s hysterical
But he doesn’t really laugh

-- He pours over paperwork as he eats alone Sees the
sombrero on a shelf Can’t stand the sight Tosses it ina
closet

-- Popper lies in bed His alarm sounds His eyes pop open
MR POPPER
Monday (Hooray)
INT MR POPPER’S CONDO - LATER

Popper tightens his tie as he heads for the door He flings
it open and finds a large shipping crate waiting for him

MR POPPER
What the--

He sees a stamp on the side Antarctica Realizes

MR POPPER (CONTD)
My souvenir

Popper struggles to drag the crate into the apartment then
searches for a way to open it He tugs at a metal latch
Just then his cell rings Popper fumbles for his phone

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
Pippi did you get through to Van
Gundy Great Hold on lemme write
this down

Popper walks away from the crate to grab a pen and paper
Behind him the side of the crate falls open Dry ice steam
billows out Out steps a live EMPEROR PENGUIN It steps
over to Popper who is completely unaware of its presence

MR POPPER (CONTD)
At the Tavern 9am

Popper checks his watch pacing as he talks on the phone
The penguin follows right behind him

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
If I leave now I should be able to
make it just in--

The penguin lets out a “WOONK” Popper stops cold and slowly
turns Upon seeing the bird he drops the phone and stares
dumbfounded for a beat then picks up his phone

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
Uhhh Sorry Dropped the phone
There’s a uhh Never mind
There’s no way to make it later
Okay just I’1l be there

Popper hangs up his face numb with confusion He and the
bird stare at one another for a LONG beat Popper reaches
down and gives the penguin a poke in the chest checking to
see that this is really happening “WOONK” Popper looks
into the crate then back to the penguin

Popper cautiously reaches down and picks up the penguin it’s
mellow fine with being handled They regard one another for
a beat The bird takes a dump on Popper’s shoe Popper’s
cell phone rings again

INT MR POPPER’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Popper rushes in sets the penguin in the tub and pours in a
bag of ice

MR POPPER
Don’t get too cozy in there Puff-n-
stuff When I’m back from the
office youre heading right back
where you came from

Popper pulls the door shut tight and sprints out

INT MR POPPER’S CONDO

and falls onto the crate CRASH It smashes to pieces

MR POPPER
(looks skyward)
Thanks Dad

but flounders falling back into the faucet handle Water
begins pouring into the tub “WOONK”

INT TAVERN ON THE GREEN - DAY

Popper checks his watch nervous about every second he’s not
back home

MITCH VAN GUNDY
She’ll insist it be kept a

MITCH VAN GUNDY

Popper smiles weakly and nods The second Mitch’s back is
turned Popper sprints away

INT MR POPPER’S CONDO - EVENING

Popper flies through the front door Digs through the big box
until he can find the PACKING SLIP Dials his cell phone as
he races up the stairs the packing slip in hand A man with
a thick strange accent answers on a static-filled line

MR POPPER

and Hello Hello (dropped
call) DAMN IT

Again the shadow flies by Popper grabs the door handle

SPLASHHH The bathroom is eight feet deep in water A tidal
wave blasts Popper back washing him and the penguin down the
staircase across the floor and into the kitchen The penguin
rides the wave down winding up on Popper’s chest “WOOONK”

INT MR POPPER’S CONDO - NIGHT

Popper opens the door An ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER with thick
glasses stands holding a clipboard

ANIMAL CONTROL GUY

INT MR POPPER’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Wearing an apron Popper sharpens up his carving knife over
the penguin who lies calmly on the cutting board

MR POPPER
Okay you’ve done this before
With chickens And ducks And

Popper looks calm and pragmatic as he raises the knife
Suddenly his face floods with childlike empathy He tries
fight it like Superman fighting Kryptonite

MR POPPER (CONTD)
Just - too - damn - cute

INT MR POPPER’S CONDO - MOMENTS LATER
Popper opens the front door and whispers to the penguin

MR POPPER (CONTD)

DARYL

Popper is now back on the couch working on his laptop The
bird is calm Popper flips it a small fish then takes a bite
of a slice of pizza from a delivery box He picks off
another anchovy and tosses it to the bird

SEVERAL QUICK JUMPCUTS of Popper on the couch working into
the wee hours Talking on the phone typing yawning making
notes drinking Red Bull and all the while the penguin is
at his knee staring at him It finally gets the best of him

MR POPPER
You gotta stare at me It’s
creepy See How d’you like it

Popper gets right in the bird’s face and stares back The
bird blinks

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
Yes You blinked (then) And I

Bag

Popper hurries across and grabs his leather messenger bag
tossing it over his shoulder The penguin follows Popper
sags a bit to the side of the bag The penguin despite not
having a bag does the same

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
You’re weird (HOOOONK) You’re
right I’m weird Because I’m
talking to a water fowl

Popper heads out the door The penguin again follows

MR POPPER (CONTD)

Popper points dramatically at the door The penguin does the
same

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
No I’m going You’re staying

Popper jumps turning to see KENT the neighbor

MR POPPER
Kent

KENT
Is that a pet I hear Popper

MR POPPER

KENT
Cant say I’d blame you I mean

MR POPPER
It’s not a pet Kent I left the TV
on My mistake I’11 take care of

From the other side of the door “WOONK” And a CRASH

shattered vase Popper drops his head in frustration The

EXT ALLEY - DAY

A side door opens and Popper peeks out Nobody in the alley
He steps out with the penguin following close behind The
penguin stops

MR POPPER
Oh now you don’t follow me

But the bird stays put Popper walks over to it A
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN appears at the mouth of the alley She
glances over and sees Popper He jumps in front of the
penguin and waves to her casually She waves back She can
see that he’s hiding something but she’s a good distance
away

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

in pain and then tries to appear casual

MR POPPER (CONTD)
These things’ve come a long way
from Tickle Me Elmo

The woman shakes her head

MR POPPER (CONTD)
I have to run now but if you’re
not doing anything--

The penguin gooses him with a flipper She hustles off

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

MR POPPER
(pained)
This was great

Once he’s sure she’s out of sight he turns to the penguin

MR POPPER (CONTD)
Have you ever seen a puppy You’re
supposed to help me get the girl

The penguin raises its wing like a child that wants to hold
daddy’s hand Popper begrudgingly takes the penguin by the
tip of the wing and slowly leads it out of the alley

EXT MR POPPER’S BUILDING- DAY

Popper and the penguin come out of the alley onto the
bustling sidewalk The busy New Yorkers walk right by
without a glance Popper hails a cab The penguin puts its
wing up as well as if it too is hailing the cab Popper
tries to secretly load the penguin into the cab

CABBIE
Is that a penguin

Popper is immediately busted

MR POPPER
I guess it is yes

CABBIE

her head no) You can handle this

She sneaks up to the bird and timidly reaches down for it
The penguin bites her She jumps and screams The penguin

runs her off with a “WOONK” He waddles back to Popper’s
knee

PIPPI
The penguin apparently prefers you

MR POPPER
I know It’s like my shadow Just

little Neosporin on your hand

PIPPI
Pardon

MR POPPER
Just find a zoo or something -

MRS VAN GUNDY swings open Popper’s door the two lapdogs

perched in her purse Pippi jumps in her way before she can

enter Her face is all panic

PIPPI
Mrs Van Gundy If you’d please
pause outside a moment Mr Popper
is preoccupied with a personal
prob--

But Mrs Van Gundy barges past her

MRS VAN GUNDY
That thing you’re doing It’s not
cute

Mrs Van Gundy finds Popper sitting at his desk No penguin
Popper is rattled and battling to appear casual

MR POPPER
Mrs Van Gundy It is truly an
honor

INSERT The penguin is under the desk at Popper’s knee

Popper offers his hand Mrs Van Gundy leaves him hanging
The two little dogs SNIFF wildly at the air smelling the

MRS VAN GUNDY
I know you spoke with Mitch My son
would rather cash out before he
puts me on an ice floe and sends me
out to sea

MR POPPER
I’m sure Mitch wouldn’t--

MRS VAN GUNDY
It’s what I’ve requested The
Eskimos had it right

She sits down in Popper’s plush leather guest chair

MRS VAN GUNDY (CONT’D)
This chair is so cushy and
comfortable

MR POPPER
It’s an antique

MRS VAN GUNDY
So am I That’s why I don’t like
cozy chairs

(MORE)
MRS VAN GUNDY (CONTD)
I could nod off at any minute and
miss some of the beautiful speech
you’re about to give where you try
to scam me into selling my family’s

restaurant
MR POPPER
(smiles)
No speeches Let’s just talk
(then)

Now it’s no secret business has
been slow lately The sheen of the
place has been tarnished

The penguin is pecking at Popper under the desk Popper
grimaces Steals a glance downward

MRS VAN GUNDY
My eyes are up here Mister

Mrs Van Gundy covers her old lady cleavage

MR POPPER
I’m not gonna dress this up as
something it’s not If you don’t
sell the place will hang on a
while But it’1ll be a long slow
death in which your assets will
waste away to nothing

MRS VAN GUNDY
That’s the cold hard truth

MR POPPER
Yup

MRS VAN GUNDY
Refreshing Now here’s some for
you I could sell the place to any
number of leeches like you The one
who’s gonna get it is the one who
truly sees the heart of the
restaurant It’s simple People go
there and eat Other people make
them the food and bring it to them
These are all good people Ive
known them a long time I care
about them I want to know they’1l
be taken care of

MR POPPER
Thank you for being straight with
me

MRS VAN GUNDY
Also your office smells like dead
fish

MR POPPER
(smiles weakly then)
I promise this isn’t about a
building Mrs Van Gundy It’s
about the people in it And I’m
going to look out for them long
after you’re an iceberg

From under the desk comes “WHOOP-WHOOP” Mrs Van Gundy
looks around As do her dogs Popper covers by “raising the
roof” and doing his own

MR POPPER (CONTD)
Whoop Whoop It’s what the kids do
today to punctuate a point

MRS VAN GUNDY
Are you comparing yourself toa
child

Mrs Van Gundy slowly gets to her feet

MRS VAN GUNDY (CONTD)
The jury’s still out on you
Popper We’re hosting a fundraiser

attend And I suggest you behave
like an adult

Now that she’s standing the dogs can see the penguin and
freak YIPPING

MR POPPER
Of course

Popper not wanting her to see the bird below quickly pulls
her into an awkward hug The dogs muffled between them

MRS VAN GUNDY
Unhand me please

The penguin pecks Popper under the desk causing him to break
away Mrs Van G quickly turns for the door not seeing the
penguin The dogs yip but she GROWLS back at them and they
cower

MRS VAN GUNDY (CONTD)
It’s been a pleasure

Pippi waits at the door

the penguin out as not to be detected As they approach his
door Popper finds another crate waiting for him This one
is larger and fancier than the first

MR POPPER
Yes That’s your ride home

INT MR POPPER’S CONDO
Popper opens the side of the new crate

MR POPPER
Alright In you go

Popper turns to grab him but the bird waddles away Popper
walks after him

MR POPPER (CONTD)
It’s okay Come here

His back turned Popper doesn’t see ANOTHER PENGUIN venturing
out of the crate THEN ANOTHER The two new penguins pad
out into the condo and are out of sight by the time Popper
returns with the first penguin He puts him in then turns
his back to pick up the crate door off the floor As he does
this the first penguin and ANOTHER NEW PENGUIN step out

The new one runs off When Popper turns he sees his penguin
is out of the box

MR POPPER (CONTD)
Come on now I don’t have time
for this I’ve got the kid’s

MR POPPER
It’s an infestation

PIPPI (VO)
Mr Popper all the penguin people
refuse to procure penguins from
private parties But there’s one
promising possibility - a purveyor
of peculiar pets

MR POPPER
Great Get him over here ASAFP

Popper hangs up and runs to the front door He digs through
the grocery bag he’d left there He removes a can of
sardines and pops it open He wafts the smell out of the can
with his hand Suddenly all the birds stop what they are
doing and cautiously approach Popper

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
That’s it boys Who’s hungry
Come on you little snow rats

All at once six birds bum rush him Popper tosses the can in

converge on the TV watching with great interest

Popper hurries in to find Pippi holding some papers

PIPPI
Mr Popper Per your predicament
I printed out some pertinent points
on penguins from a Wikipedia page

Popper sits down at his desk Pippi reads from the sheet

PIPPI (CONTD)
Ahem “Emperor penguins are
pleasant with people and when
separated from their penguin pals
may imprint on a particular person
as if that person were a penguin”

MR POPPER
Oh they’ve imprinted on a
particular person alright

PIPPI
Plus “Penguins possess a puzzling
capacity to locate their penguin
counterparts”

Popper stares at her for a beat then snatches the document
from her hands and skims it

MR POPPER
Facts facts facts But what do
they want What do they like

PIPPI
Oh Right there

She points to a line on the sheet

MR POPPER
“thrive best and are happiest
when socializing within massive
penguin colonies in the harsh
conditions of their home on the
great Antarctic coastal ice pack”
Great Thanks That’s a huge
stack of help

You like Mommy

MR POPPER
Billie It’s not like that anymore
Remember we talked about this when
I moved out Sometimes a Mommy and
Daddy--

JANIE
Yeah but you never looked at Mom
like that when you lived at home

Popper considers thrown

INT MR POPPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Close on Popper’s face his daughters’ words still ringing in
his head His far away look turns to a look of annoyance as
he glances at the SIX PENGUINS SLEEPING WITH HIM He lets
out a heavy sigh

INT MR POPPER’S CONDO - AFTERNOON
Popper is interviewing a kindly round Hispanic NANNY

MR POPPER
We’re talking standard hours light
housekeeping minimal um Just
plop ‘em in front of the TV

NANNY
Perfect So should we meet the

kids

MR POPPER
Right Okay then He they are

Popper leads her around the corner to where the penguins are
watching Charlie Chaplin on TV Popper winces in
anticipation of her reaction

NANNY
(no big deal) So you‘ll be home by
ten

MR POPPER

(pleasantly surprised) The latest
(then re TV) Chaplin movies seem
to do it You keep ‘em coming
they just zone right out

INT POPPER’S BEDROOM - LATER

Popper dressed in a tux leaves his bedroom and

INT POPPER’S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

--looks in at the penguins sitting in a row now watching
The Great Dictator the nanny sitting a comfortable distance
apart Popper waves to her The nanny unfazed waves back
Popper leaves his apartment closes the door triple locks
it and takes a deep breath Free at last

INT TAVERN ON THE GREEN - DUSK

A black tie gala in full swing Snow blows like crazy
outside the restaurant’s greenhouse windows

Popper makes his way through the crowd finally spotting Mrs
Van Gundy (with dogs as always) and Mitch

MR POPPER
It’s a lovely affair Mrs Van
Gundy

MRS VAN GUNDY
Thank you What a compliment
Youre like the son I never had

MITCH VAN GUNDY
Ma I’m your son

MRS VAN GUNDY
Exactly

MR POPPER
(forces a smile)
And it’s for such a good cause The
Popper Group made a generous
donation to the Wildlife Fund

MRS VAN GUNDY
Aw How sweet Charities are scams
All the money goes to the salaries
of the do-nothings who run them

The Wildlife Fund PRESIDENT and a photographer approach

WILDLIFE FUND PRESIDENT
Mrs Van Gundy can we get a shot
of you for the Fund’s newsletter

MRS VAN GUNDY
Of course

Popper takes the opportunity to step away and dials his cell

INTERCUT - MEDIA ROOM MR POPPER’S CONDO

The penguins are still watching Chaplin calm and
entertained The Nanny sits on the couch doing a
needlepoint The phone rings and she answers

NANNY
They are behaving themselves
beautifully Like perfect little
gentlemen Nothing to worry about

MR POPPER
Wow Alright Well keep up the
good work and don’t hesitate to--

NANNY
You are worried like a new mother
It is adorable

MR POPPER
I am not You have my cell right
I posted it on the fridge

NANNY
No problem Mr Popper

The Nanny goes back to her needlepoint sitting on the
remote The TV switches from the DVD to cable a nature doc
on Discovery where a SEA LION roars THE PENGUINS SCREAM AND
RUN OFF IN EVERY DIRECTION It’s pandemonium

The nanny grabs her things and runs screaming out of the
condo leaving the door ajar

INT MR POPPER’S CONDO LOBBY
Kent confronts Daryl

KENT
I’m telling you that man is up to
something

Behind Kent’s back the nanny rushes past in the background
Followed by SIX PENGUINS Daryl does a double-take tries
not to look over

DARYL
Sorry Kent As far as Im
concerned Mr Popper is an ideal
tenant

EXT MR POPPER’S BUILDING

Snow falls The penguins do a few laps around the revolving
door before they figure it out and emerge onto the sidewalk

Captain squawks and crosses the street The others follow
They cross in the crosswalk in a shot framed just like the
famous cover of “Abbey Road”

INT TAVERN ON THE GREEN - SAME TIME
Back on Popper and the Van Gundys

MR POPPER
So I’ve spoken with the escrow
people and we estimate--

MRS VAN GUNDY
Blah blah blah
(takes his arm)
C’mon Popper let me show you the
magic of this little jewel box we
call Tavern on the Green

Mrs Van Gundy grabs Popper by the arm Popper looks back
pleadingly at Mitch who feels his pain

EXT NEW YORK STREETS

The penguins stop at a corner Captain looks around

CAPTAINS POV the window of FAO SCHWARTZ A big stuffed
penguin in the display

INT FAO SCHWARTZ - MOMENTS LATER

The penguins waddle into the store A LITTLE GIRL spots
them

LITTLE GIRL
Mommy penguins I want one

MOM
(not paying attention) Come on
Cupcake (then) We’re getting the
coloring books--

A CUSTOMER’s face lights up as she spots Captain She picks
him up and turns to a sales clerk

FEMALE CUSTOMER
Ma’am how much is this item
There’s no tag on it

Captain poops on her shoes As she inspects Captain and
company waddle off

The penguins move down an aisle of giant plush animals The
penguins coo with curiosity at the fake beasts that look down
at them

Captain’s POV A bear a moose a giraffe and A KILLER
WHALE THE BIRDS FREAK TRUMPETING AND RUNNING OFF

Delighted children chase after the birds as they rumble out
of the store

EXT NEW YORK STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

Captain leads the birds across the street A LOUD SCREECHING
SOUND The birds stop A MASSIVE SNOWPLOW IS COMING RIGHT
FOR THEM Its blade is pushing a huge pile of snow

The birds waddle away but the plow bares down on them closer
and closer until the penguins are swallowed up by the
billowing snow pile The plow pushes the snow pile into an
alley then backs away No sign of the penguins

After a long beat Captain’s head pops out of the snow Then
the others one by one They wiggle out of the pile and
shake off the snow Captain toboggans down off the pile

The others follow right behind

EXT PARK

The penguins crest a hill A vicious stray Rottweiler steps
out of an alley nearby He growls One by one the penguins
tip over and toboggan down the hill The dog goes after
them The penguins pick up speed but the dog is gaining
He’s right on top of them when the penguins reach a frozen
pond The birds expertly bank left cracking the whip and
sending the dog spinning away and clawing at the ice

The birds rocket toward a snow drift at the edge of the pond
They each hit the snow jump and sail through the air

EXT TAVERN ON THE GREEN

Were in the back of the restaurant where a BUSBOY pushes a
garbage bin out into the snow leaving the door propped open
The busboy casually tosses trash into a dumpster

Behind him the penguins each fly over a nearby hedge hit
the snow and toboggan out-of-control down the hill and slide
through the door and into the restaurant the door slamming
shut behind them

The busboy finishes up Tries to get back in but the door’s
locked Shrugs

INT KITCHEN

Mrs Van G leads Popper into the massive bustling kitchen
finding the head chef ARNOLD

MRS VAN GUNDY
Ah come meet our head chef
Arnold Arnold this man wants to
buy you from me

ARNOLD
Pleasure to meet you sir

MRS VAN GUNDY
Arnold has been cooking the same
exact food here for over forty
years Good thing liverwurst never
goes out of fashion

As she continues Mr Popper sees THE PENGUINS WADDLE BY
across the kitchen

MR POPPER
(forces a smile)
Mm hmm

MRS VAN GUNDY
Youre still so young Arnie My
father must’ve hired you right out
of the culinary academy

ARNOLD
Actually I studied to be an
accountant

MR POPPER
Impressive
(to Mrs Van G)
Let’s move on shall we

MRS VAN GUNDY
Are you in a rush to get through
meeting the people whose very lives
depend on you

The dogs have the penguins’ scent GROWLING Popper’s eyes
grow widehe’s got to do something

MRS VAN GUNDY (CONTD)
They sense when someone’s of ill
repute Are you crooked Popper

MR POPPER
No I just Love this song That’s
playing out there

You can’t hear any music back here
MRS VAN GUNDY
I don’t hear it Being old is
horrible Never do it
MR POPPER
Well it’s a lovely tune and I was
hoping I could have this dance

He reaches out her hand The dogs snarl Mrs Van G hands her
purse to the chef

MRS VAN GUNDY
Watch the babies

All business she takes his hand

MRS VAN GUNDY (CONT’D)
I hope you can keep up with me

As they hurry out of the kitchen across the room Captain
sees Popper HONKS Hurries after

The dogs leap from the purse and chase the birds The kitchen
tumbles into chaos things spilling cooks scrambling

Stanley the dog tries to nip at Loudy and he SQUAWKS
slapping it away with a flipper It lands in a salad

Dominico leaps at Bitey who ducks The dog slams into an
electric mixer knocking it into a pot of water Its cord
sparks at the outlet a tiny plume of smoke rising

INT DANCE FLOOR

Popper and Mrs Van G dance She is ice cold stiff arms
fully extended

His eyes are on the kitchen Each time its doors swing open
we can glimpse a different bit of insanity within

MRS VAN GUNDY
I get your game son I may be easy
on the eyes but you can’t woo your
way into a sale

MR POPPER
Of course not

Finally Captain bursts into the restaurant the others
following Tumult left in their wake

The CROWD laughs and applauds at the site of them
Mrs Van Gundy pulls away from Popper

MRS VAN GUNDY
What is the meaning of this

MR POPPER
Maybe they’repart of the
entertainment From the Wildlife
Fund

The dogs race out and catch up to Nimrod SNARL at him The
other penguins all see Come to their friend’s defense The
whole lot are imposing Together they all HONK The once-
tough doggies now WHIMPER and scramble away

Mrs Van Gundy snaps at the sight of her beloved dogs crying

MRS VAN GUNDY
How dare they

Hurries over to Mitch who’s blissfully enjoying his me time
away from Mom with a shrimp cocktail laughing at the
penguins as they struggle across the dancefloor

Nimrod can’t get around a guest and they do a little
accidental dance trying to get out of each other’s way

MRS VAN GUNDY (CONTD)
Mitchell did you approve this

MITCH VAN GUNDY
Nope But at least they’re dressed
for the occasion

Popper tries to edge away when she turns to him

MRS VAN GUNDY
Where are you going

MR POPPER
I thought I’d call the appropriate--

The penguins make a beeline for Popper

MRS VAN GUNDY
Do you have something to do with
these beasts

MR POPPER
Me

The birds surround him clearly his buddies

MR POPPER (CONTD)
Why would I know penguins

He walks away They follow Faster And again they follow
He throws his arms up in desperation They mimic him exactly

MR POPPER (CONTD)
Okay they’re mine It’s a long--
My father-- I’m sorry

FOOM The kitchen erupts in flames Staff rush in to put it
out

MRS VAN GUNDY
And my kitchen’s on fire I’m
adding that to the asking price
Not that I’m likely to sell to you
after this nonsense

MR POPPER
Please give me another chance
This is the last you’ll see of the
penguins I promise

SMASH CUT TO

TRAINING MONTAGE KICK IN “YMCA” BY THE VILLAGE PEOPLE

bay as he tosses them fish (Like trying to teach a dog to
stay) Soon they all rush him and Popper goes fetal

-- Popper is on-line reading about penguins and taking notes
He watches some penguin videos on You Tube

-- Now he has just one penguin to deal with as the others
peek over from where they are penned up behind the couch He
holds the bird at bay After a couple of tries he gets the
bird to stay Popper pumps his fist and tosses him a fish

-- Now all six birds are lined up shoulder-to-shoulder They
march toward Popper He raises a hand they halt Popper
tosses them each a fish He raises his left arm they each
mimic the move and they each get a fish It’s getting fun

-- Loudy shrieks Popper does the “close your beak” hand
signal Loudy stops shrieking and he gets a fish

-- In the bathroom Popper holds each bird over the toilet
one by one

-- Popper is at the office watching his penguins on web Nanny-
cam He stands and walks out of his office He stops when

he notices Stevens entertaining the other execs by waddling
around like a penguin and catching Swedish Fish in his mouth
thrown by his buddy

STEVENS
Feed me Mr Popper feed me

Stevens stops when he sees Popper After an awkward moment
Popper goes back into his office

-- Popper gives the penguins a bath A few bubbles come up
around Stinky The other penguins scoot away

-- Popper reads a book about penguins as he casually tosses
fish to the well behaved birds seated around him

-- Janie and Billie enter the condo Their jaws go slack
when they see the penguins all lined up before Popper He
leads them in the YMCA dance (which he now has down pat) and
they follow along perfectly Billie joins in Janie can’t
help but laugh

MR POPPER
Nice to meet you Rick

Rick goes with the fist bump instead of the shake

MR POPPER (CONTD)
Right The fear of germs

RICK
It’s not a fear More of a valid
concern I mean most phobias--fear
of heights say--ridiculous
unfounded But germs They’re
dangerous organisms that kill

from stones

He grabs a few stones and places them on the floor The
penguins see begin to nudge them into a pile

Aw Look at that She’s getting
ready for her baby

The kids help adding more rocks Giving the adults a second

Tavern matriarch Selma Van Gundy

In a pre-taped bit the reporter approaches Mrs Van G with a
microphone

REPORTER (CONT’D)
Mrs Van Gundy a couple words

MRS VAN GUNDY
Sure Go away

We move over them through the dark condo to the dining room

They sit at the table and talk in hushed tones Amanda takes
a bite - yum

AMANDA

So that’s the next big deal
MR POPPER

Mm hmm
AMANDA

The next mission to tackle
MR POPPER

No sweat
AMANDA

You and you your missions I
remember in college When you first
found out I was a vegetarian

MR POPPER
And yet I still fell for you

AMANDA
There were no meatless options at
the dining hall So what did you
do You showed the administration
pictures of slaughtered cows and
cooped up chickens until they
changed the menu You get handed a
problem and you solve it

(MORE )
AMANDA (CONTD)
I always liked that about you It
made me feel safe

MR POPPER
Thanks

AMANDA
And then it drove me crazy

MR POPPER
Really

AMANDA

I guessthere’s just some things
that can’t be easily solved Thom
Sometimes safe is justsafe You
know your father--

MR POPPER
My father My father lived with his
head in the clouds Never finished
a thing he started Always chasing
the next “big idea” I set a goal
and I accomplish it

AMANDA
True but where’s the adventure in
that

MR POPPER

Adventure’s overrated
AMANDA
Says the man with a six-pack of
penguins in his living room

known that
They’re closer now looking into each other’s eyes

You’re damn right

STEVENS

You‘re living with penguins You

WAITING FOR THE UNHATCHED EGG MONTAGE

Popper’s facial hair grows and he looks more haggard every
shot (Set to “It Don’t Matter to the Sun (But it Matters to
Me)” by Rosie Thomas)

-- Popper paces in the morning light

-- Popper sits on the floor at night eating a TV dinner and
checking on the egg every few seconds

-- Bitey sadly watches the other proud parents He looks
down and taps at his egg Popper starts to tear up but
holds it in

-- Popper answers the door looking like hell Daryl stands
there looking sympathetic

He hands Popper an eviction notice Popper takes it without
emotion and closes the door Popper walks back in crumples
the notice tosses it and sits down by Bitey and the egg

-- It’s nighttime again and Popper is still pacing He stops
and blows up at the egg

MR POPPER

Come on Hatch damnit This isn’t
me you know I don’t do this
Ever So congrats You’ve got me
with my defenses down And now
you’re gonna just kick me in the
gut aren’t you I actually cared
about you and this is what you do

He collapses onto the floor He’s falling apart

MR POPPER (CONTD)
I’m sorry Please Just Don’t
let me down You’re so close
Please

Popper sleeps on the floor He wakes up just as Bitey stands
up and lets his egg roll away It rolls off the snow and
onto the hard concrete where it spins a turn and then stops
Bitey waddles off

wouldnt be like this again

the bench Before she goes Amanda crosses to him clearly
disappointed

the right thing to do

AMANDA
The right thing for the penguins or

Go It’s okay

Amanda takes the girls The penguins waddle after Then see
that Popper isn’t coming along They waddle back to him

MR POPPER (CONT’D)
No Go with them

But those penguins won’t go

MR POPPER (CONTD)
You guys’re unbelievable

Nat and the Assistant arrive winded but angry

NAT
Give me the penguins Popper

MR POPPER
They won’t leave me

NAT
Then I guess you’re coming too

Nat produces his taser Zaps it menacingly

Popper retreats stepping under the tunnel

Nat lurches toward Popper and the penguins all snap at him
aggressively

NAT (CONTD)
I’1ll zap ‘em if I have to

MR POPPER
No Don’t Okay guys Stop
You have to go with him

They seem to understand

MR POPPER (CONT’D)

friends You’re gonna get another
egg this year I promise Captain

A tear runs down Popper’s cheek Not spinning this problem
but feeling it

NAT
Are you done crying with birds

Popper nods Just as the penguins are about to walk to
Nat

FOOOOM The crook is covered in a heap of snow dumped onto
him from the bridge above the tunnel Amanda and the kids
stand with the Tavern staff and Mrs Van Gundy

Popper looks up smiles at them

JANIE

POPPER
It was just very cold

Okay I was crying

POPPER (CONTD)
Not that I ever wouldve changed
it but I’m leaving the Tavern just
how it is

MRS VAN GUNDY
You‘re damn right you are crybaby

Nat pops up from the snow for air whenCLINK He’s cuffed
by Cop 1 who’s arrived on the scene

COP 1
You don’t wanna know what they do
in jail to guys who mess with
penguins

Cop 2 grabs the Assistant Pippi smiling nearby

As the cops drag them off Popper picks up Billie still in
her ballerina outfit

MR POPPER

The audience laughs goes crazy Amanda applauds a little
nod to her not-so-ex-husband
