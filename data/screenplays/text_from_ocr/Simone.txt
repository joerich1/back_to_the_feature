SIMONE
by

Andrew Niccol

FADE IN
ON BRIGHT OUT-OF-FOCUS OVAL-SHAPED COLORS

The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression
of looking through a kaleidoscope

As the image comes into sharp focus we discover that we are
inside a CANDY BOWL A MANS FINGERS are frantically
removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy

EXT STUDIO LOT - DAY

The man performing this curious task is
writerproducerdirector VIKTOR TARANSKY forties
conservatively dressed in suit and tie He sits alone at an
empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage
some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
the tables paper cloth

Viktor finishes sorting Finding no trash can to deposit the
rejected cherry candy he scoops them into his pocket

A young headset-clad PA hurriedly approaches He looks
ill

PA
Mr Taransky --

Viktor reads the young PAs panicked expression

VIKTOR
Shes walking Dont tell me
shes walking
(blood slowly draining
from his face)
She is not walking She cant
walk

EXT TRAILER - DAY
NICOLA ANDERS twenty-something A-list actress beautiful
face scowling is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
from a movie trailer to a limousine VIKTOR desperately
follows after Nicola

VIKTOR
-- Nicola How was your massage

NICOLA
Youre in breach

VIKTOR
-- Is this about the new pages --
I made the changes you wanted
youre in virtually every scene --

NICOLA

(wheeling on him)
Its not the size of the role
Viktor

(suddenly very cool)
Am I or am I not contractually
entitled to the biggest trailer on
the set

VIKTOR

(regarding the enormous

silver fish behind them

confused)
Its the biggest on earth I
swear Its a 50-foot Airstream --
they dont make them any longer
than that

NICOLA
Taller Viktor

VIKTOR
Taller What

Viktor looks up in horror The trailer next to Nicolas does
indeed appear to be fractionally taller

NICOLA
(walking away)
Youve insulted me for the last
time

Viktor looks to the tires His face suddenly brightens

VIKTOR
Nicola its just the tires --
theyre over-inflated I can fix
it

Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen Air hisses out

VIKTOR
See its lower already

Nicola ignores Viktor marching towards her limo with her
PUBLICIST Abandoning the trailer Viktor hurries after her

VIKTOR
I beg you You cant do this to
me

NICOLA

(looking back)
I had three other offers I only
signed on to this picture out of

loyalty

VIKTOR
Then show some Theyll shut me
down

NICOLA

(opening the car door)
It wasnt working anyhow The
scene with the thousand geese -- I
dont understand this film I
dont think anyone will understand
it I already put out a press

release -- citing creative
differences
Viktor stops nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm
VIKTOR
You know what Nicola youre
right
(picking up her last piece
of luggage)

Here let me help you with that
(holding the door for her)
You ought to go The truth is I
dont deserve you This film
doesnt deserve you Frankly it
deserves much much better The
reason its not working is because
youre not about the work
Nicola is stunned

VIKTOR
(to the limo driver)
To Hell please

The door slams and the limo roars away Viktor looks to the
still hissing trailer tire The CREW regards Viktor
apprehensively

VIKTOR
(to the crew)
What are you looking at Get back
to work

The crew is uncertain what work there is to do
INT BEDROOM - SUNRISE SUNSET - NIGHT

In an ornate bedroom NICOLA lies on her death bed under a
veil of netting A distraught man HAL sits close by

NICOLA
(whispered)
Jack are you there

HAL
Im here Im right beside you

A NUN enters
NUN

(to Hal)
You should really go now

NICOLA
No its alright Please let him
stay
The nun withdraws Hal holds his face in his hands almost
breaking down
HAL

(a glance to heaven)
What kind of cruel God is it that
would take you away from me

NICOLA
The same one who brought me to you

HAL
No I cannot accept it If
something like this can happen
What
(struggling to find the
words)
What is it for

NICOLA
(smiles through her pain)
-- Why are we here Is that what
youre asking Jack Why are we
here No why Just here

Nicola dies peacefully
INT SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY

VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL THREE EXECUTIVES and studio
head ELAINE CHRISTIAN watching a rough assembly of the film
It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS

The lights go up The image of Nicola fades off the screen

EXECUTIVE 1
Shes good You can hardly tell
shes reading off a teleprompter

VIKTOR
(ignoring him)
Ive analyzed the footage Weve
got almost everything we need in
the can If we rework the script
we can finish the film without her

EXECUTIVE 2
(forceful shake of the
head)
According to the writ her attorneys
filed at noon today Theyll sue
if the film is released with Nicola
in a single frame

VIKTOR
(more anxious)
So well re-cast

HAL
Nicola Anders is the only actress
who can play that role

VIKTOR
(incredulous)
Its a re-make Hal Anders is not
bigger than this picture

Elaine finally speaks up

ELAINE
Of course she is No other name is
going to sign on now and risk
offending her

VIKTOR
We dont need a name Well cast
an unknown

HAL
I wont play opposite an unknown

ELAINE
We cant sell an unknown Nicolas
soured on the project and we have
to accept that If we ever want to
be in the Nicola Anders business
again we have to cut our losses
and shelve the picture

The executives leading man and director nod sagely

VIKTOR
(aghast)
No You will not give in to that
blackmailing bitch

ELAINE
(a wince addressing
everyone but Viktor)
Excuse us

Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room
EXT STUDIO LOT - DAY

ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous
soundstage They speak more freely in each others company

ELAINE
God Viktor Why do you always
have to make things so difficult
for yourself

VIKTOR
Difficult Im difficult
He produces a handful of candy from his pocket

VIKTOR
(referring to the candy)
-- Do you know what these are
Elaine

ELAINE
(talking a piece of candy
and eating it)

Hmm Mike and Ikes
VIKTOR
Not just any Mike and Ikes -- cherry

Mike and Ikes Do you know why I
Viktor Taransky two-time Academy
Award nominated director --

ELAINE
-- Viktor that was Short Subject

VIKTOR
-- overseeing the most cherished
movie project of my career am
walking around with a pocketful of
cherry Mike and Ikes

Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces

ELAINE
-- I have a feeling youre going to
tell me

VIKTOR

-- Ill tell you why It is
because Miss Nicola Anders
supermodel with a SAG card Gods
gift to cinema has it written into
her contract that all cherry Mike and
Ikes be removed from her candy
dish along with strict instructions
that any room she walks into should
have seven packs of cigarettes
waiting for her three of them
opened that there be a personal
jacuzzi within eighty paces of her
dressing room and that any time
she travels her nanny must fly
with her first class

ELAINE
-- Whats wrong with that
VIKTOR

Elaine she doesnt have any
children

(grabbing her arm)
Dont you see Were being held
hostage by 12 men and 5 women who
someone somewhere has decreed are
the A-list

ELAINE
The public decides whos on that
list

VIKTOR
Please

ELAINE
Its the truth Those 17
superstars are our insurance
policy We cant open -- cant
make a profit without them

VIKTOR

We can hardly make a profit with
them Up-front salary back-end
deal perks per diem percentages
-- Theyre mocking us Elaine
Were at their mercy

(staring wistful into

space)
We always had movie stars but they
used to be our stars We used to
decide who would play what role
We told them what to wear what to
say who to date When they were
under contract we could change
their names if we wanted to -- more
than once

ELAINE
(regarding him as if hes
insane)
You realize youre nostalgic for an
era you werent even born in

VIKTOR
(irritated at her
infuriating logic)
Well I do remember why I started
out in this business -- you seem to
have forgotten -- working in New
York with Cassevetes -- we were
trying to do something important
shine a light in that darkened
cinema --

ELAINE
(rolling her eyes)
-- Its called a projector

VIKTOR
(ignoring her)
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with
a ray of truth

ELAINE
Listen Viktor I have good
memories of those days too -- but

this isnt about that or you or me
or some high-minded ideal This is
business

VIKTOR
Spare me
ELAINE
(gesturing at the studio
lot)

-- Christ Viktor look around
What do you think pays for all
this This is about investment and
return Those days in New York
thats its over

A pause Viktor reads Elaines face

VIKTOR
Youre not renewing my contract

ELAINE
How can I Your last three
pictures tanked The board is
giving me hell No bankable star
will work with you after this If
you just compromised a little

Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the
news

VIKTOR
(rueful smile)
-- Well its not every day youre
fired by the mother of your own
child

Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate
moment between them

ELAINE

(softening a heart-to

heart)
Im not taking away your daughter
just your deal You and I both
know after the divorce I kept you
on for old times sake so you
could still hold your head up in
front of Lainey I called whats
his name at Warners He said hed
take a meeting -- in July Ive
fought for you Viktor

(voice trails off)
You want to talk severance

VIKTOR
(staring off into the
distance face hardening)
You can have everything -- office
car assistants -- all I want is
the picture

ELAINE
(confused)
The pictures dead

VIKTOR
So theres no problem -- I can have
the rights the negative too

ELAINE
(believing shes getting
off lightly)
Theyre yours But how are you
going to finish it Without a star
theres no movie

VIKTOR
I dont need a star All I need is
an actor -- Ill reshoot the part

cut out Nicola and replace her with
a real actor A real leading lady

ELAINE
Even if you find her you know the
problem with unknowns Viktor If
theyre good they get known And
then youre back to sorting their
candy and worse

(kissing him on the cheek

as she departs in her

studio golf cart)
Im sorry Viktor

Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages left
alone on the deserted lot

EXT STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK

Twenty NICOLA ANDERS FACES jiggle into frame VIKTORs face
appears amongst them

They are cardboard figures standing together in the trailer
of an electric cart A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional
standees from around the lot

VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out --
we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen
year old girl LAINEY appears beside him carrying a laptop
computer

LAINEY
Hi Dad

VIKTOR
(slightly ashamed)
Hello sweetheart

Viktor embarrassed by his childishness steps aside for the
suspicious workman who carries the standee away

Lainey smiles sweetly She hugs him

LAINEY
m sorry Mom canned you

VIKTOR
(shrugging)
ts really not anything
Lainey Its just --

LAINEY
Dont feel too bad

(glancing to a standee)
Mom runs the place and they still
walk all over her Youre better
off out of it

VIKTOR
(regarding his daughter)
You look very grown up What are
you doing You meeting your mom
for dinner

She glances towards the entrance where Laineys mother
ELAINE and her dependable uncomplicated businessman
boyfriend KENT wait beside Elaines car

LAINEY
(reluctant admission)
Kent got tickets to the ballet

Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head

VIKTOR
(trying to convince
himself as much as
Lainey)
Im going to finish the picture
sweetheart Its important

LAINEY
(not quite convinced)
I know youll do it Dad Youre
Viktor Taransky

Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye She runs to her
mother and Kent

VIKTOR
(to himself)
Thats right Im Viktor Taransky

EXT STUDIO BUILDING - SOME DISTANCE AWAY - DUSK

From a distance ELAINE and KENT regard the lonely figure of
VIKTOR

KENT
You had no choice Elaine Hes a
liability

ELAINE
(wistful look to Viktor)
He also happens to be the most
talented man Ive ever known

Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches

EXT STUDIO BACKLOT - TRAM - DAY
CLOSE UP on a copy of Variety The front page banner
headline ANDERS RIDES OUT OF SUNSET -- Cites Creative
Differences

The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on
a studio tour -- HANK ALENO He wears a pair of spectacles
with one lens blacked out his head tilted on one side It
is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hanks one
good eye

TARANSKY CALLS A-LIST
OVER-PRICED OVER-PAMPERED PRIMA DONNAS
- Directors Future Now In Doubt -

The tram pauses The TOUR GUIDE keeps up a commentary

TOUR GUIDE
-- On your left the house where
Claris Commodore uttered those now
immortal words If that door
doesnt hold stand behind me
And coming up on your right --

When the tram departs we discover that Hank has exited the
tram and is hiding in the facade of a New York subway
entrance The tag around his neck reads VISITOR -- Stay
With The Tour

EXT STUDIO GATE - NIGHT

VIKTOR wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding
several framed black and white photographs of screen legends
under his arm

HANK hiding in the shadows of the soundstages spies Viktor
He hurries towards him as Viktor approaches his antiquated
Bentley

HANK
-- Mr Taransky Mr Taransky
thank God Ive been trying to see
you calling -- Your assistant
wouldnt put me through I told
her it was a matter of life and
death I was afraid I wouldnt get
to you in time --

VIKTOR
(using his stack of film
cans as a barrier)
-- Please get away from me
HANK
I did it Mr Taransky I licked
skin I licked hair I licked
every part of her

VIKTOR
(more disturbed fearing
he is dealing with a
pervert)
You want me to call Security

HANK
have her Mr Taransky The
answer to your prayers
(producing the Variety
article conspiratorial)
The answer to this

VIKTOR
(regarding the article)
was misquoted

HANK
have your new leading lady
(indicating the bulge in
his pocket)
right here in my pants

Viktor takes a step back concerned once again about the
mans motives

HANK

(trying to reassure)
Its me Mr Taransky Dont you
recognize me -- The Future of
Film conference in San Jose
Hank Hank Aleno I was keynote
speaker You must remember my
speech Who Needs Humans

VIKTOR
(faint glimmer of
recognition)
Thats right You were booed off
the stage Thats got to be --

HANK
-- Eight years ago In that whole
time I never left my computer

VIKTOR
(wary)
Good for you Hank

HANK

(referring to his covered

eye)
Good and bad They think thats
what caused this Me eye tumor
Microwaves from the screen Its
the size of a grapefruit Heavy
too

VIKTOR
(regarding the pathetic
figure with the tilted
head)
Im sorry

HANK
Dont be It was worth it

Hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket Viktor
now understands the significance of the gesture

HANK
You have to see her

VIKTOR
(loading cans into the
car)
Ive seen them all before

HANK
Not like this --

VIKTOR
(patronizing smile)
Come on Hank A synthespian
virtual actor --

HANK
(irritated)
-- We call them vactors

VIKTOR
I need flesh and --

HANK
-- Flesh is weak

VIKTOR
-- a living breathing actor -- I
cant work with a fake
Viktor loads his film cans into the car

HANK

(pointing to Nicola in

Variety)
You already do But my actor wont
get old fat lazy or drunk --
wont throw tantrums demand a body
double script changes or a bigger
trailer

(whispers conspiratorial)
The Disney Corporation has been
using artificial actors for years

VIKTOR
Thats the point Hank No matter
how good they are theyre still
Mickey Mouse Everyones tried
Everyones failed It cant be

done

HANK
It can -- with my new computer
code you and me we can do it
together

VIKTOR
I dont know anything about
computers

HANK

Thats why youre so perfect You
have something I dont have

VIKTOR
Whats that

HANK
An eye -- for performance You
know the truth when you see it I
know Ive seen your movies I
love your movies

VIKTOR
You do

HANK
Straw God changed my life

VIKTOR
You saw that
Viktors car roars away

HANK

Ive seen every frame of your work

Youre the only filmmaker in
Hollywood with the artistic
integrity to realize my vision
You and me art and science we
are the perfect marriage

VIKTOR
Listen Hank its been a rough
day
(climbing into his car)
Ill call you about his next week

HANK
(at the car window)
I wont be here next week The
tumors inoperable Ill be dead

VIKTOR
(winding down the window)
Im already dead

in the rear view mirror

HANK
Call me
(looking at his watch)
This week

He looks back at the forlorn Hank

A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is
wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips

INT VIKTORS MALIBU HOUSE - DAY

A sea of ingenue headshots

of them

VIKTOR
(into phone referring to
a young womans headshot)
-- What do you mean she wont work
with me Shes done nothing She
doesnt have a single credit --

AGENTS VOICE
(from phone off-camera)
-- Better no credits than a
Taransky credit No young actress

Black Xs are drawn through all
VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces
the telephone

talking on

in his spartan bachelor beach house
is going to step into Nicola
Anders shoes and risk ending her
career before its even started

VIKTOR
-- Art you dont understand Ive
mortgaged everything to finish this
film -- creditors calling coming
to the house for Gods sake I
need this --

The phone goes dead Viktor tries to re-dial --
disconnected

VIKTOR
-- Damn

Sharp knock on his door Viktor peers through a curtain and
spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT carrying what looks
to be a legal notice in his hands

Viktor slips out of the back door
EXT BEACH - DAY

VIKTOR hurries along the beach When he turns he discovers
the MAN IN THE SUIT following him As Viktor runs the Suit
runs -- calling out to him

MAN IN THE SUIT
Mr Taransky Mr Taransky --

VIKTOR
(calling back)
Im not him

Viktor stumbles When he recovers the Suit is on him

MAN IN THE SUIT

Mr Taransky Sir I represent the
estate of Mr Hank Aleno

(showing him Hanks

obituary in the LA

Times)
It was Mr Alenos last wish that
you have this

The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope

VIKTOR
What is it
MAN IN THE SUIT

I have no idea Sir He wanted you

to have it
The Suit departs Viktor hesitates then breaks the seal on
the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive The hard-drive
is labeled SIMULATION ONE
A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN

SIX MONTHS LATER

CLOSE UP ON

a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet

On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR The red

carpet leads to a rundown downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the
venue for the premiere of SUNRISE SUNSET To save money
on posters Viktor has altered the originals Starring

NICOLA ANDERS crudely pasted over with Introducing SIMONE
EXT RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK

VIKTOR regards the sad little premiere No paparazzi no
limos no klieg lights Resorting to giving away tickets to
PASSERS-BY Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in
trash

VIKTOR
Want to see a free movie

HOMELESS MAN
(he thinks)
No

A taxi pulls up Viktors daughter LAINEY steps out

LAINEY
(kissing him hello)
Hi Dad
VIKTOR

Hello Lainey

Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesnt have quite enough
cash Lainey pays herself

VIKTOR
Your mother couldnt make it

LAINEY
Shes at the premiere of A Cold
Day In Hell But I think she send
someone from Acquisitions

VIKTOR
She still with Kent

LAINEY
This week anyhow

VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet regarding
the pathetic premiere As they walk by the bulb in Viktors
sole spotlight expires

VIKTOR
Not quite how I imagined it --

LAINEY
(looking on the bright
side)
-- You finished the film on your
own terms thats what matters
Did you really do all the post
yourself

VIKTOR
There was no other way

LAINEY
I missed you I wondered if you
were ever coming back

VIKTOR
Me too

LAINEY
(regarding the makeshift
poster trying to lift
his spirits)
Well I cant wait to meet

Simone whats her last name
VIKTOR

You know I dont know
LAINEY

Is she here tonight

VIKTOR
She cant watch herself

They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER
THEATER OWNER
-- Hey we have to start Ive got

she turns SIMONE She is exquisitely ethereally

INT RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

In the near-empty dilapidated theater SUNRISE SUNSET is
playing ON THE SCREEN

When Simones face appears the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS
change They are all visibly moved including the THEATER
OWNER Some weeping some with curious smiles on their
faces some opened-mouthed

HAL
(ON SCREEN approaching)
Valarie what are you running from

SIMONE
(enigmatic smile)
From Valarie

Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out Simone collapses to the
ground

HAL

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying Now even LAINEY is affected by
Simones performance She wipes a tear from her eye

VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads trying to gauge the
audience reaction Finally the credits roll

A dedication For HANK

No one moves from their seats Viktor permits himself a
brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the
credits

A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY

Still no one moves from their seats Viktor cannot stand it
any longer He runs to the restroom

INT THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT

Face over the stained sink VIKTOR splashes himself with
water He looks to the mirror horrified by his own
reflection He rehearses a courtroom speech

VIKTOR
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury I
may be guilty of a crime but it
was committed with the purest of
intentions to send a message to
the acting community who put
themselves above the work and
above --

Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom They approach the
urinals

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
(continuing their
conversation from the
lobby)

-- So fake

AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
-- Totally artificial

Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits missing
the end of their conversation

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
Were really supposed to believe
that was 19th Century Lisbon

AUDIENCE MEMBER 3

Whos looking at the sets when she
is on the screen

All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate

INT THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

VIKTOR exits the restroom Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS
including LAINEY are waiting for him

LAINEY
(pointing out her father)
There he is Thats my dad Viktor
Taransky

Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group
spontaneously applauds They rush to shake his hand

AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
-- She is magnificent

AUDIENCE MEMBER 5
-- Absolutely unreal

Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments

VIKTOR
She wasnt too cartoony

AUDIENCE MEMBER 6
-- Who The nun

AUDIENCE MEMBER 7

-- Or are you talking about the
mother

AUDIENCE MEMBER 8
-- A star like that who cares
about the supporting cast

AUDIENCE MEMBER 9
-- Congratulations again She
The group

should be very proud

VIKTOR
Not of this earth

whole --

drifts away leaving

LAINEY
Shes a miracle Dad

VIKTOR
(vague)
I saw her picture on
internet

A good way of

daughters face)

You really didnt notice anything --

unusual

LAINEY
Only her brilliance

Lainey regards the makeshift poster

Viktors head snaps around

LAINEY
I have a feeling mom

LAINEY
Back on the lot

Lainey smiles

Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding

INT VIKTOR TARANSKYS MALIBU HOME - NIGHT

(ignoring his sarcasm)
Why isnt she with you

VIKTOR
Why Because she would never show
up at something like this Shes
intensely private

Elaine sighs exasperated

ELAINE
(dismissing her
colleagues)
Back to work everyone Shes not
here

The reception committee disperses murmurs of disappointment

ELAINE
Viktor I want to thank you for
convincing Simone to sign with the
studio

VIKTOR

Dont thank me It was entirely
Simones decision Do you have
Simones check

ELAINE
I dont have it on me Anyway it
means a lot

(quickly changing tack)

Have you read the reviews Theyre
love letters

(reading from a newspaper)
Listen to this one Simone has
the voice of a young Jane Fonda
the body of Sophia Loren the grace
of well Grace Kelley and the
face of Audrey Hepburn combined
with an angel

VIKTOR
(musing to himself)
Almost right

ELAINE
I cant wait to meet her

VIKTOR
I dont know if thats going to
happen

ELAINE
(confused)
Why not
VIKTOR

As I say shes something of a
recluse Thats how shes able to
stay so pure -- by isolating
herself in her art
ELAINE
(face falling)
Dont be ridiculous I arranged a

press conference

VIKTOR

Out of the question A circus like

that

ELAINE
Viktor its my studio

VIKTOR

REPORTER 1
Yeah but -- who are you

VIKTOR
(patronizing smile)

I am a two-time Academy Award
nominated director with over

eighteen films to my credit thus
far including my latest release
Sunrise Sunset Who are you

A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity

VIKTOR

I will not be taking any questions
However I do have a statement to
read on behalf of my leading lady
Simone

(reading from his

statement)
To Whom It May Concern Im
deeply grateful for the
extraordinary public response to
Mr Taranskys film At this time
I will be conducting no interviews
or making publicity appearances
since I am really nothing without
the beautiful worlds and characters
Mr Taransky creates for me I
politely request that the press
respect my privacy and let the work
speak for itself All questions
and inquiries should be directed to
Mr Taransky to whom I entrust all
aspects of my career Yours very
truly Simone

The reporters all call out at once

REPORTER 2
-- Viktor Viktor whos Simone
dating

REPORTER 3

-- Viktor whered you find her

REPORTER 4
-- Is Simone her real name

REPORTER 5
-- Whats she got to hide

REPORTER 1
-- Is she the new Garbo

REPORTER 2
-- Whos Garbo
Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his
hands

VIKTOR
I thought I made it clear -- no
questions regarding Simone
(bringing the press
conference to a hasty
conclusion)
Now I would like to close by
announcing that Miss Simone begins
production today on her next film
Eternity Forever This project
has been near and dear to my heart
since I wrote it nine years ago
(a tinge of bitterness
then a smile)
I Thank you

Viktor exits the podium A voice stops him in his tracks

VOICE (0S)
Who do you think youre fooling
Taransky

Viktor turns The voice belongs to over-zealous crusading
truth-seeking investigative reporter MAX SAYER accompanied
by his assistant MILTON

VIKTOR
Do I know you

MAX
Max Sayer -- National Echo

VIKTOR
(regaining his composure
a smirk)
Dont you have a real story to
write Why arent you in Latin
America

MAX
This is the story

VIKTOR

I remember when the Echo had class
-- the paper that could bring down
governments

MAX
Our leaders arent presidents
anymore -- theyre pop stars and
screen idols If Woodward and
Bernstein were alive today theyd
be right here in Hollywood with me

VIKTOR
They are alive Sayer

Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living

MAX

So theyre probably here

(hardly missing a beat)
You might be able to sell this
disappearing act to the rest of
the world but Im not buying it
Whats really behind this Simone
woman The public has a right to
know Why is she staying out of
sight And why the hell is she
with you I dont want you to take
this the wrong way Viktor but
youre not exactly Cecil B
DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill

VIKTOR
Maybe the reason shes with me is a
little thing called integrity
Sayer Look it up

Viktor walks away

MAX
(calling after him)
Oh I know all about integrity I
know even more about persistence
Look that one up

Max watches Viktor depart with obvious suspicion
EXT SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY
A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage

CLOSED SET is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera
panning the entrance A SECURITY GUARD also keeping watch
nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf
cart script in hand

SECURITY GUARD
No one came in or went out just
like you said Mr Taransky
VIKTOR
Good

SECURITY GUARD
Is Miss Simone coming today

VIKTOR
Shes already here She arrived
before you and shell leave long
after youve gone

(admonishing guard)
Remember under no circumstances
are you or any other person to
enter the set without my express
permission

SECURITY GUARD
What if it catches on fire

VIKTOR
Let it burn Simone would rather
go up in flames than give up her
privacy

Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
the soundstage

INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a
tablet attached to a large projection screen monitor and two
side monitors VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor

VIKTOR
(to himself as he inserts
his Hollywood hard-drive
-- SIMULATION ONE)
Pay no attention to the man behind
the computer

A title appears on his computer screen
Welcome
to
SIMULATION ONE

With a satisfied smile Viktor backspaces characters until he
revises the title to

Welcome
to

SIMONE
He presses ENTER and a face begins to build -- wire upon
wire pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian
emerges -- SIMONE She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and

blood actress

Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --
titled VISUAL LOOP 6 Within the confines of the monitor

she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal She looks a
little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for

too long

VIKTOR
(to the screen)
Good morning Simone

SIMONE VIKTOR
Good morning Mr Taransky

VIKTOR
A star is

SIMONE VIKTOR
digitized

Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking
into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a
key on his keyboard When he speaks she speaks Simones
voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to
Viktors voice A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to
mimic his movements

SIMONE VIKTOR
You mean they buy it

VIKTOR
(nervous smile as he
examines his first
royalty check)
Buy it Theyre paying for it
And around here thats how you
really know they buy it

Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to
the terminal -- from the LA Times obituaries

VIKTOR
Im only sorry Hank isnt here to
see this
Viktor looks up Simone mimicking his action

SIMONE VIKTOR
(depressing the button
every time he wants to
express his thoughts
through Simone)

Maybe he can

VIKTOR
Do you have any idea what this
means Simone Our ability to
manufacture fraud now exceeds our
ability to detect it

SIMONE VIKTOR
(appearing to indulge
Viktor with a smile)

I am the death of real

VIKTOR
(pondering the enormity of
the hoax)
You are birth of what A
Phenomenon A miracle A new era
in show business All I wanted to
do was finish the film

SIMONE VIKTOR
And now look what youve started
And now look what youve started
And now look what youve started

Viktors conversation with himself is not merely for his own

amusement He is adjusting and refining Simones voice
VIKTOR
Hmm a little less Streep a

little more Bacall

Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars living and
dead that comprise Simone

Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
dedicated to Simones audio incorporating the vocal
deliveries -- 20 STREEP 80 BACALL

He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment The
voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic

representations of the sound waves

SIMONE VIKTOR
Is that better Mr Taransky

VIKTOR
Yes Yes it is

VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself He scrolls through the
list of screen legends He clicks on the image of AUDREY
HEPBURN

VIKTOR
While I think of it Id like you
to add something to your repertoire
-- remember that thing Hepburn does
in Breakfast At Tiffanys

A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in Breakfast At Tiffanys plays on
the screen Hepburn sitting on a fire escape looks up

AUDREY HEPBURN
(from the screen an
incomparable smile)

VIKTOR
(pausing the moment)
Lets hear you say Hi like
Audrey

With a CUT and PASTE Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly
into a frozen Simone Viktor presses play

SIMONE
(imitating Audreys
performance perfectly)

VIKTOR
Perfect
(stretching)
God Im so relaxed around you

SIMONE VIKTOR
You did create me

VIKTOR
No I just helped bring someone
elses dream to life

SIMONE VIKTOR
Mr Taransky we both know I was
nothing without you I was
computer code -- ones and zeros
VIKTOR
Youre right Youre right Of
course one doesnt want to boast
Its a classic case of technology
in search of an artist Thats all
youve been waiting for an artist
with integrity with a vision who
can see

Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room warming to
his theme SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor
nodding attentively as if shes really interested

VIKTOR

See beyond that irrational
allegiance to flesh and blood --
See that with the rise in price of
a real actor and the fall in price
of a fake the scales have tipped
in favor of the fake

(voice raising in

excitement)
-- See that if the performance is
genuine it doesnt matter if the
actor is real Once a performance
is committed to film the blood and
bones are gone anyway Only the
spirit the illusion remains
Besides whats real anymore
These days most actors have digital
work done to them so its a gray
area

SIMONE VIKTOR
(Simone appears to look
directly at her maker)
Are you ever going to tell the
truth about me Mr Taransky

VIKTOR
The only real truth is in the work

SIMONE VIKTOR
You know what Im talking about

VIKTOR
Yes Yes Im going to tell the
truth about you why wouldnt I
(pondering his own
question)
Of course with Hanks tragic
passing the secret died with him
(shaking the thought from
his head)
I am going to tell the truth
after your next picture

Feeling uneasy at the prospect Viktor changes the subject
He pulls out his script for ETERNITY FOREVER

VIKTOR
Speaking of which -- this is the
project Id like you to do next

SIMONE VIKTOR
Not Eternity Forever The
legendary unproduced script that
was too good ever to get made Id
kill for that part

VIKTOR
I was hoping youd say that

Suddenly Simone appears to talk on her own

SIMONE
Ill do anything to please you Mr
Taransky
VIKTOR
(pretending to be hard of
hearing)

Im sorry I didnt catch that
What did you say

SIMONE
Ill do anything to please you Mr
Taransky

On a side monitor we discover a highlighted box marked PRE
RECORD -- Viktors finger on the PLAY button He is
unable to resist speaking another line

SIMONE VIKTOR
And I will never ever leave you

Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing hima kiss --
until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked
GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK SMILE GIGGLE SIGH KISS
FLUTTER OF EYES FLICK OF HAIR PUFF OF CHEST

Viktor comes close to the monitor He notices something
about Simones face
VIKTOR
Youre so beautiful Too
beautiful

Viktor accesses a program labeled DISTINGUISHING FEATURES
He adds a FRECKLE and a MOLE

From a distance we watch him alone with Simone in the vast
empty soundstage

EXT STUDIO LOT - DAY

VIKTORs face against the SKY As he walks we reveal that
the sky is no more than a huge painted backdrop on the
studio lot -- behind a parking lot Viktor hands his valet
ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER

VALET MANAGER
-- Just be a minute Mr Taransky
We gave you a complimentary car
wash -- theyre washing the engine
now

Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for
their cars under an umbrella A young TALENT AGENT
approaches

TALENT AGENT
Viktor Look Im sorry I didnt
call you back last year I was
er out of the country
(strained moment)
But we should get together My
schedules wide open

VIKTOR
Sure Ill call you

The agents face falls He gets in his car disconsolate
Suddenly HAL SINCLAIR rushes over and hugs Viktor

HAL
Viktor Im so happy for us

VIKTOR
Hello Hal

HAL
The film The chemistry No
reflections on Nicola but Simone
and I -- we were just so right
together

VIKTOR
You never were together Hal

HAL
And still the connection was
undeniable
(aside)
I havent read Eternity Forever
but I know its brilliant And I
know I would be perfect for Clive

VIKTOR
(correcting him)
Clyde

HAL
Yes perfect
(lowering his voice)
As a matter of fact I ran into
Simone on the lot the other day

VIKTOR
(genuinely startled)
Really She didnt mention it

HAL

(quickly covering)
Im sure shes meeting with a lot
of people right now

(under his breath)
She is just as you described her
Viktor indescribable I
strongly sensed she thought I was
right for it

Behind his back Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on
his cell phone The phone rings Viktor feigns surprise and
answers

VIKTOR
(answering the phone he
has just dialed louder
than necessary)

Hello SIMONE How are you
sweetheart
A hush descends over the executives Hal is suddenly very

uncomfortable Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the
conversation
VIKTOR
(winking to Hal)
Youll never guess who Im with
you ran into him on the lot

HAL
It was more in passing

VIKTOR

Youre so far off

(finally chuckles)
Hal Hal Sinclair your co-
star Remember now No I dont
think hes put on weight

(a shrug of apology to the

appalled Hal)
Anyway you think hes right for

Eternity Forever not the
right type a different
direction

(covering phone to Hal)
Ill try to talk her into it

The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark A
mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave climbing
into his car

VIKTOR
(into phone)
Listen this is a bad place to
talk what sweetheart I know
you have charity work you want to
do I know you want to give back --
but remember your greatest gift is
your talent well talk about it
at the beach house this weekend
Im looking forward to it too

Viktor hangs up His car pulls up He tips extravagantly
and drives away The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell
phones

EXT STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY

Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded
windows

INT CAR - DAY

Inside the car MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON scanner in
hand are replaying Viktors intercepted phone call ona

VIKTORS VOICE
(from the machine)
-- You think hes right for
Eternity Forever not the
right type a different
direction

MILTON
(to Max a shake of the
head)
Im getting nothing from her side
of the conversation

MAX
Is it a jamming device

MILTON
(shrugs)
Maybe hes talking to himself

MAX
(dismissing the idea)
Taransky isnt that good an actor
No theyre taking special
precautions Some kind of new
encryption

MILTON
Why

MAX
(musing)
Whatever it is its dark

MILTON
Dark

MAX
Yes very

They continue listening to the recording

INT VIKTORS MALIBU HOME - MORNING
VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast Lainey is in her pajamas
occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father
prepares French toast

VIKTOR
(glancing to the computer)
Cant you stop that

LAINEY
Why

VIKTOR
Those things can be dangerous
Staring at a screen all day -- you
miss whats going on outside in the
real world You can lose yourself
You should get out more How are
you going to meet boys

LAINEY
(shrugs coyly getting up)
I know plenty of boys

VIKTOR

freak

LAINEY
Dad I can spot a middle-aged freak
a mile away

VIKTOR
Okay But you have to find a way
to escape that thing

LAINEY
I do

VIKTOR
How

LAINEY
I read

VIKTOR

You do Still I cant tell you
how happy I am to hear that

LAINEY
You were the one who insisted on
it Reading me Dostoyevsky and
Joyce when I was four

VIKTOR
You understood them Thats what
was amazing
(looking out the window)
Its a nice day Lets eat
outside

Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door We hear a
chorus of CLICKS

LAINEY
Actually it may be nicer inside

Viktor joins her at the doorway

VIKTOR
Stay here Ill deal with this

Unfazed Lainey retreats into the house

EXT VIKTORS MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING

Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full
of telephoto lens-toting PHOTOGRAPHERS The next door houses
have LENSES protruding through the drapes of the windows

VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto
the beach soaking up the attention -- unable to resist
waving extravagantly

Suddenly a PHOTOGRAPHER losing his balance drops from a
nearby rooftop The photographer limps towards the fence
Viktor calmly follows retrieving the photographers camera
and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly
relishing the attention

The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins
several dozen other SHUTTER-BUGS and VIDEORAZZI

PHOTOGRAPHER 1
That wasnt her Taransky

ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
Where is she You cant hide her
forever

VIKTOR
(hurling the camera into
the mob)
Youll never find her Simone only
appears when I want her to appear

MAX SAYER from The NATIONAL ECHO is at the head of the mob
accompanied by assistant MILTON

MAX
She sounds like a prisoner
Taransky Are you holding her
hostage Are you some kind of
Svengali

VIKTOR

(recognizing the reporter)
Whos the hostage Sayer her or
you You look kind of captive
yourself While youre spending
every waking hour obsessing over
Simone guess what I guarantee she
doesnt even know you exist Get
off my property or Ill call the
cops

MAX

The cops The cops read my column
to know who to bust Were the
only watchdog the public has

(looking around at the

photographers)
None of this is going away Well
be here tomorrow and the day after
that Until you slip up And you
will You are looking at your
shadow

(getting in his face)
Because all these elaborate
precautions with Simone -- every
instinct in my body tells me its
not natural

VIKTOR
Im just trying to help you Sayer
I dont want you to be
disappointed It gets cold out
here at night

MAX
Nice try If we cant get to her
through you maybe your family will
be more co-operative I can
guarantee you Taransky one way or
another Miss Simone and I are
going to get acquainted

Id like to see that Sayer

VIKTOR drives along a twisty mountain road LAINEY in the
passenger seat They have become so blase about the
paparazzi they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle
PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car

REPORTER (ON RADIO)
-- The rumor is Simone is holed up
in Taranskys Malibu home -- so far
we havent seen so much as a
glimpse --

VIKTOR
(switching off the radio)
Honey Im really sorry about all

for you to stay the weekends
just until things settle down

LAINEY

Okay Dad

VIKTOR
If anyone asks about Simone --

LAINEY

lack of interest)
Dont you wonder where Im really

Well shoot it on the last day

Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look

VIKTOR
As Ive tried to explain to you
Elaine Simone isnt like any

other actress youve ever known
Shes about the work and only the
work -- lives for the work She
wants all the money up there

(gazing into space)

on the screen where it belongs
Shed work for scale except I know
you only respect people you pay a
fortune

ELAINE
Which accounts for your percentage
(tossing the budget on the
coffee table)
When do I get to meet this dream

VIKTOR
Not today Shes learning her
lines

You can also take cue cards and
teleprompter out of the budget

be in it

to you

ELAINE
(exasperated)
Experience Viktor Ive seen this

I cant tell you how delighted I am
to have this wonderful cast
assembled for Eternity Forever
Thank you all Now a reminder --
as a condition for working on this
film you will not be rehearsing
with Simone shooting with Simone
and you are forbidden from
contacting Simone in any way at any
time whatsoever

The CAST nods seriously

How will you do our love scenes

VIKTOR
Body double

HAL
(confused)
For her
VIKTOR

For you

(addressing the entire

cast)
I want you to know Simone
appreciates you all working for
scale But why am I thanking you
Simone can thank you herself She
insisted on speaking with you
before filming begins Shes on
the line now

Viktor nods to a speaker phone in the center of the table a
red blinking light on the phone The cast reacts excitedly

VIKTOR
(pushing a button on the
phone)
Simone are you there

SIMONE
(through the speakerphone)
I certainly am Mr Taransky

excitement)

VIVIAN
(hesitant about broaching
the subject)
This last year I was going
through some things
(shaking her head at the

memory)
Awful awful things But when I
saw Simone in Sunrise what she
did in the scene in the

fireworks factory

(face lighting up)

suddenly everything made sense
My friends family doctors --
nobody could reach me -- but
Simone she really spoke to me

Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony

VIKTOR
Shell be happy to sign it

INT PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

A green set Walls floor ceiling -- all green A FULL
CAST shoots HAL dressed in a futuristic suit tentatively
crossing the green expanse

Hal pauses looks longingly then impulsively dashes forward
Hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the
ground

VIKTOR (0S)
Cut Cut Cut
Hal freezes VIKTOR runs from behind the camera and
confronts Hal on the green floor

VIKTOR
Hal what are you doing

HAL
Viktor Clyde simply has to get
close to Simone in this scene He
has to touch her He has to

VIKTOR
Absolutely not

HAL
But shes right there I must feel
her

VIKTOR
You cant

HAL
Why not

VIKTOR
(struggling to find an
excuse)
Theres a wall between you --

HAL
-- an emotional wall I know
Thats why --

VIKTOR
-- No No A real wall
(describing a wall with
his hands within the
green space)
You ran right through it

HAL
(confused)
How did the wall get there

VIKTOR
I cant explain it to you now --
youll see when its all put
together
(walking away)
Anyway we got it a couple of takes
ago Lets move on
Hal dumbfounded tentatively touches the non-existent wall
INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

Viktor digitally adds SIMONE standing beside a sportscar with
HAL in a scene from Eternity Forever He works on her
close up

SIMONE
(eyes welling with tears)
-- What you dont understand
Clyde is that love is like a wild
flower but that flower only
grows --

Viktor hits STOP and Simone freezes Viktor brings up a menu
and chooses from a range of EMOTIONAL OPTIONS

JOY SADNESS FEAR
elated melancholy anxious
jubilant tearful frightened
giddy weeping petrified
ecstatic blubbering loss of bladder
inebriated Kevorkian control
CONTEMPLATION INNOCENCE SENSUALITY
reflective chaste seductive
thoughtful virtuous lustful
meditative angelic bestial
stoic Madonna Madonna
bored out of her Blessed Virgin Like A Virgin
skull
He fine-tunes SIMONEs performance -- sliding a cursor ona

performance axis from BROAD to SUBTLE

VIKTOR
Lets take it down a notch

SIMONE
-- What you dont understand --

Simone freezes again Viktor make another adjustment

VIKTOR
I like it But still too big
(making a correction)
Smaller teardrops next time

Simones tears retreat into her eyes
VIKTOR

Its not working Its not alive
Lets try it again

She repeats the line Viktor mimes the performance

Clyde

SIMONE

(teardrops arriving on
cue)
-- What you dont understand

(dramatic pause)

of a very high cliff

Simone FREEZES

Perfect

is that love is like a wild

Viktor returns SIMONE to her neutral background

VIKTOR

Im only sorry you still have to
work with flesh and blood for the
time being -- as user friendly as
you are
an entire cast

To Vivian

Love

even I cant manufacture

Simone -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity

shot He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo

Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to SIMONE on his screen --
she is waiting patiently as usual

VIKTOR

We are going to have to change our

plans

Simone -- you have no idea

what an affect your performance is
having on people We cant stop

now

Theres too much to say --

these films they speak they speak
to the human condition Were
changing lives No revealing the
truth now would be too cruel
(searching for more
justification)

Anyway
greater truth -- in the work -- you
are not so concerned with the
lesser truths along the way

when youre seeking a
Simone doesnt appear convinced

SIMONE VIKTOR
Youre going to get in a lot of
trouble Mr Taransky

VIKTOR

(irritated at her pricking

his conscience)
Why do you have to bring that up
Theres always risk -- lifes a
risk Its worth it Besides how
could something so lovely be a
crime

(regarding her tenderly)
Well I think weve done enough for
today Youve been cooped up in
there too long How about you and
me go out on the town Theyre
expecting us

The Concierge straightens as he recognizes Viktor from a copy
of Variety Headline Taransky Rides Ingenues Coat-Tails

require no help with her luggage

at any time for any reason She
will be departing for a function

in their wake Viktor gently removes the coat from over her
head

Although the woman is impossible beautiful she is not
Simone FAITH is Simones latest stand-in and decoy Viktor
and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the
limousine

VIKTOR

(not quite able to avert

his eyes from her

telescopic legs)
Thank God for you Faith I know
this is above and beyond the call
of duty for a stand-in You dont
know what a service youre
performing for Simone -- shielding
her from those animals

FAITH
No thank God for you Mr
Taransky How many men would go
to so much trouble to protect a
woman

Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their
intimate position

VIKTOR
You understand youll have to come
back to my place to keep them off

INT VIKTORS MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT

VIKTORS HEAD hits the sofa in his living room closely
followed by FAITH on top of him

Faith tears at his clothes and her own ravenous Viktor
hardly resists In the midst of the wild caresses Faith
murmurs in his ear

FAITH
Do whatever you do to Simone

Viktor freezes

VIKTOR
What What did you say

FAITH
Do what you do to Simone

VIKTOR
What I do to Simone

FAITH
Yes call me Simone

VIKTOR

FAITH
(still tearing at his
clothes)
Yes yes again again Do what
you do to Simone I want to know
what its like to be her just for
one night

VIKTOR
(confused)
Youre with me to be close to her

FAITH
(panting)
Is that a problem

As Viktor ponders the question Faith begins to do Simones
deathbed speech from Sunrise Sunset

FAITH
Why are we here Is that what
youre asking Jack Why are we

here No why Just here

(this is too much for
Viktor)
Please put your clothes on

The finished scene with SIMONE and HAL plays ON A SCREEN
INT SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY

VIKTOR watches the rough cut of ETERNITY FOREVER with
ELAINE and daughter LAINEY As usual they are mesmerized
by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE The scene ends The
light go up

ELAINE
Stunning Viktor The Hollywood
Foreign Press is going to eat this
up

VIKTOR
Thank you
(turning to his daughter)
What did you think Lainey

LAINEY
One thing bothered me

VIKTOR
I know Hal is as stiff as always

LAINEY
No not that I was just wondering
-- in the bedroom scene in reel two
why did Simone have no reflection
when she walked in front of that
mirror

Viktor is shocked busted He covers it with a laugh

VIKTOR
(ashen-faced)
I wondered if youd spot that
Youve got a good eye Lainey Im
proud of you

Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation

VIKTOR
I got them to remove the
reflection The mirrors metaphor
-- to show how her characters
inwardly dead

ELAINE
Thats genius Viktor Was that
Simones idea

VIKTOR
(sarcastic annoyed at the
suggestion)
Who else Its always Simones
idea
LAINEY

(not quite convinced)
So that accounts for the lack of a
shadow in reel six

VIKTOR
Precisely

EXT STUDIO LOT - NIGHT

VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaines car parked
outside the theater

LAINEY
(as she gets into the car)
Good-night Daddy
VIKTOR
(kissing Lainey good-bye)
Night Lainey

Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car

VIKTOR
(drawing Elaine aside)
Elaine I dont know if its a good
idea for Lainey to come to the
screenings -- mature content and
all that

Both look to Lainey From inside the car Lainey watches her
parents

ELAINE
(impressed by his
responsible attitude)
Maybe youre right
(gently teasing)
Twelve years after your daughters
born you decide to become a father

VIKTOR
Better late than never

ELAINE
(softening)
I should fire you more often The
films looking wonderful

VIKTOR
You really think so

ELAINE
Yes To be honest I never quite
saw this film before -- maybe its
the way Simone is playing it -- but
what its saying about the illusion
of permanence in everyday life how
thats the only way we can love --
I think its really going to mean
something

VIKTOR
Thank you Ill tell Simone you
liked it

ELAINE
Id love to tell her myself
(cajoling)
When are you going to let me meet
her

VIKTOR
Soon Soon

ELAINE
Everyone I know has met her
Viktor

VIKTOR

Everyone you know is lying

ELAINE
(amused)
Thats true

They instinctively kiss more affectionate than before
However their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera
shutter from a nearby bush

VIKTOR
Damnit

The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood

ELAINE
You know how you can stop that
She has to get out more

See you at the premiere

Elaine climbs into her car and drives away

hoped for SUNRISE SUNSET Red carpet klieg lights

Viktor waves Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane
their necks waiting for someone else to step out of the open
car door but nothing The door shuts A disappointed

murmer The limo drives off
VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare

scoop)
Do I hear the sound of wedding
bells

Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the
carpet

VIKTOR watches him go flabbergasted

EXT PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT

Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely

alone

He observes ELAINE champagne in hand and the younger KENT
schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS

MOVER SHAKER
Elaine The picture is a
revelation

ELAINE
Thank you I mean it was a team

effort --

Viktor cannot resist taking Elaines photo with a small
pocket camera Elaine is unaware of the shot

Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him
Viktor picks up a drink from the bar A DRUNK WOMAN perched
unsteadily on a nearby barstool is knocking back Jack
Daniels She accidentally brushes one of her discarded

glasses off the bar Viktor catches it

A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder HAL stands there
accompanied by his Eternity Forever co-star MAC

HAL
Is she here

VIKTOR
Im fine Hal How are you

HAL
(oblivious to his sarcasm)
Somebody said she was here

Mac spots the two glasses in Viktors hands -- one glass
lipstick-smeared

MAC
Oh my God thats her glass
(impulsively smelling
Simones glass)
Jack Daniels straight-up She is
my kind of woman

HAL
(looking anxiously around
the room)
Viktor where is she

VIKTOR
Shes around

to the far side of the
packed room)
Jesus Hal shes in the Ladies
Room

HAL
You know I sometimes forget she has
bodily functions

VIKTOR
(unable to resist)
I know what you mean

HAL
(anxiously looking to the
restroom)
I have to talk to her about my
experimental film Its very
experimental

MAC
Is that her -- By the fountain
Far across the party a WOMAN with a Simone-type hairstyle
her back to us is standing at the edge of a fountain

VIKTOR
(testy)
No In fact between us she
doesnt really exist

to the woman)
Simone

Several nearby GUESTS including ELAINE overhear They talk
over each other

-- Where is she

MAC
-- Shes by the fountain

What about the fingerprints What
happened when we dusted that hotel

Well we got some of Taranskys
fingerprints a lot of your
fingerprints but none of hers

(interest piqued)
Which means theyre significant

Incriminating

Perhaps criminal
(getting excited)
Shes hiding her past Shes
hiding her past

Max ponders the revelation

MAX

Of course -- no ones that perfect
that pure You know I had
something on Mother Teresa But
then she died and it wasnt worth
it anymore

(approaching a computer)
I know how to flush out this Simone
-- a tell-all story from her
childhood

My God youve got one

MAX
(offering Milton a seat in
front of the computer)
I will when youre finished writing

MILTON hesitates questioning his journalistic ethics

MAX
(disappointed in his
protege)

Am I wasting my time with you

VIKTOR
She doesnt want pity

Youre so good to protect her like

INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK
from The ECHO

VIKTOR face and body scanned by the computer is making a
final test of his equipment When he touches his hair bats
his eyes moves his hands -- so does Simone

VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind
SIMONE from a library of images Rainforest Desert Ritzy

monitor)

INT ELAINES MANSION - DAY

KENT referring to Simone forgetting or not caring that
Elaine is in the room

KENT
She is all woman

LAINEY shoots her mothers boyfriend a withering look She
gets up and leaves the room

During the interview we cut between Frank Brands studio
Viktors soundstage and various viewer locations including
Elaines mansion Max Sayers office and various worldwide
locations --

A) A lone AFGHANI SHEPHERD gazing at a Watchman

B) A JAPANESE COUPLE watching TV in a capsule hotel room
C) A CATHOLIC CARDINAL watching TV in the Vatican

INT FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT

FRANK BRAND
Well no one could accuse you of
being over-exposed Simone Why
have you stayed so completely out
of the limelight

SIMONE
(shrugs)
I just think actors talk too much
Does the world really want to hear
your life story just because youve
got a movie opening Friday

FRANK BRAND
Of course the only problem with
shying away from publicity these
days is that it tends to attract
more

VIKTOR is in his element his effeminate gestures
frighteningly convincing

SIMONE
(from TV)
Dont I know it Thats the only
reason Im here now -- to put the

attention back where it belongs on
Mr Taranskys film
FRANK BRAND
You dont secretly want the
attention

SIMONE
Im not even sure I deserve it
After tonight Ill have almost as
much screen time on your show as I
do in my movies How is that
healthy for a performer

IE ELAINES MANSION - DAY

LAINEY has turned her back on the TV screen preferring to
look through a book

SIMONE
(from TV)
Because you have to understand
Frank these interviews -- none of

this is real Who I am on screen
and who I really am are two totally
different people

FRANK BRAND
Who are you really

SIMONE
Thats a good question
(beat)
As Nietzsche said Whenever a man
strives long and hard to appear
someone else

LAINEY
(reading from a bookmarked
page along with Simone)
he ends up finding it is
difficult to be himself again

FRANK BRAND
Well put

Lainey regards the name written on the inside page -- Viktor
Taransky

INT MAX SAYERS OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY

TV playing in the background MAX and MILTON are hurriedly
leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps
MAX
(focusing on the desert
background behind Simone)
I know where that is I know

INT FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT

FRANK BRAND
Change of topic Simone youve
been romantically linked to dozens
of men in the press -- Mick Jagger
Stephen Hawking Fidel Castro
and most recently Viktor Taransky
Is there a Mr Right in there
somewhere

SIMONE
Id rather not discuss my private
life
(gently)
But Viktor and I are inseparable

INT ELAINES MANSION - DAY
ELAINEs face drops slightly hurt

KENT
You dog Viktor

SIMONE
(from TV)
I literally wouldnt be here today
without him

INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his
excitement -- the cursor aimed at TEARS command SIMONES
EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye

FRANK BRAND
Would you like a moment Simone

Viktor notices quickly withdrawing his finger -- his
startled expression instantly imitated by Simone

SIMONE
No Im okay

INT FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT

FRANK BRAND
Lets talk about the work that you
care so much about

SIMONE
Sure Where would you like to
start

FRANK BRAND
How about the nudity

SIMONE
Nudity has just never been an issue
for me Frank For me clothes are
just an option

FRANK BRAND
What exactly was it that attracted
you to your first two projects

SIMONE
(unable to resist a smile)
I suppose the thing I like most
about the movies Im in is that
theyre not about special effects

Frank nods sagely

FRANK BRAND
Theyre better for it if I may say

INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTORs face by a blinking
alert

INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK

The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up Curiously it
is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating

INT FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT

FRANK BRAND
(regarding the screen)
Well we appear to be experiencing

satellite difficulties In case we
lose you Simone I want to thank
you --

INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR speaks again his voice suddenly deeper
SIMONE VIKTOR
Thank YOU FRANK

In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug The feed goes
blank on Frank Brands screen

VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion Since SIMONE
is still synced to his movements the partially de-pixelated
Simone also slumps

Viktors cell phone rings Viktor picks up

VIKTOR SIMONE
Hel--

He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice
synthesizer

VIKTOR
(into phone)
Hello

INT ELAINES MANSION - DAY

We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on
the phone KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the
Tv

ELAINE
-- Viktor are you with her Is
she there

VIKTOR
No

An anxious beat

ELAINE
Are you and Simone
(blurting it out)
getting married

VIKTOR
(taken aback by the
suggestion)
No of course not
(realizing the
significance of the
question)
Why Would you care if we were
A pause

ELAINE

(covering realizing she

has given herself away)

Well yes From a studio point of
view it would be better if Simone
stayed single

(quick change of topic)
Anyhow I thought she came across
great tonight Intelligent well
informed a natural And touching
She was spectacular

VIKTOR
Thank you

ELAINE
Viktor do you realize you always
do that

VIKTOR
Do what

ELAINE
Whenever I compliment Simone you
take the credit

VIKTOR
I do
ELAINE
Yes you do
(shrug)

Anyway tonight was a good start

VIKTOR
Excuse me Start

ELAINE
Its a crowded summer We need
every photo-opp sound-byte and
column inch we can get Good
night Viktor

Elaine hangs up Lainey approaches

LAINEY
(carefully broaching the
subject)
Mom do you miss Dad
ELAINE
(she thinks)
Sometimes But just when I think
your fathers changing for the
better I realize hes as self
absorbed as ever He took the
credit for Simone tonight

Lainey coming to her fathers defense glancing at the
Nietzsche book in her hand

LAINEY
I think Dad deserves more credit
than he gets

INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen He is unusually anxious

As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy provocative outfit as
she awaits instructions on the screen For some reason
Viktor becomes irritated by the image

VIKTOR
(to Simone)
Will you cover yourself up

He hits a button A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body
EXT NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING

The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple
desert MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car

MAX
-- Ive been here before -- On my
honeymoon with my ex-wife

MILTON
Is that why she left you

Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND
interview He compares her desert location to the one in
front of him

MAX
(pointing out a Joshua
tree)
You see thats the exact same tree
and in the distance theres the
(voice trailing away)
mountain
Sure enough the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is
now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn

Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo

MILTON
Its a hotel

MAX
I dont understand

MILTON
Could they have built that hotel
since yesterday

Max shakes his head deeply concerned

MAX
Get in the car

INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man
publicity machine The floor is littered with photographs of
SIMONE in various states of dress and undress

Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program VIKTOR
constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine
spreads -- Time People Us Life Popular
Mechanics

VIKTOR
(angrily into phone)
-- We dont do the photo shoot you
dont get the cover written
answers to written questions
thats right website interviews
no problem

Viktor calls up a DANCE OPTION Choosing from a HULA
DANCER a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA he removes
Simones head and places it on the body of the ballerina
She begins to dance for him

He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of
SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia

He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources
With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a
beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta

VIKTOR
(muttering to himself)
You want exposure Elaine Ill
give you over-exposure

INT ELAINES OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY

ELAINE watches TV in her office She cannot change channels
without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic
answers

EXT OCEAN - DAY

CLOSE UP on the name SIMONE painted on the stern of a
luxury yacht

VIKTOR is at the helm breathing in the clean air -- at last
a moment to savor his success Simones hit single plays on
the yachts stereo He looks at peace

EXT MARINA - DAY

A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE having his photograph
taken However we discover that the Simone is only a
lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell
snapshots He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and
ELVIS

MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by

Tying up his boat VIKTORs mood is abruptly shattered by the
sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him

MAX
Nice boat Taransky

VIKTOR
ts a yacht

MAX
know what youre up to

VIKTOR
(pushing past Max)
dont have time for this Sayer

MAX
think you do
(holding up his video
print of Simone in the
desert)
know its a fake

Viktor freezes

MAX
Got your attention now

Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location
with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain

MAX
(referring to the
photographs)
Its bogus You used an old

library shot for the background

VIKTOR
(ashen)
The background is

MAX
She was never in New Mexico She
never left the studio

Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking
the background

MAX
(referring to a large
bundle of other shots
under his arm)
Ive done my homework Ive
studied her

VIKTOR
-- I bet you have

MAX

-- Ive looked at every piece of
publicity shes ever done the
video in the supermarket theres
no evidence shes ever left the
studio

(afterthought)
Oh and for some reason this woman
leaves no paper trail But I have
obtained a copy of your bank
accounts I know you have power of
attorney but so far you havent
transferred one single solitary
cent to her

VIKTOR
Im keeping it in trust
MAX
I know thats what youd like us to
believe But I got to tell you --
embezzlement is a serious matter
Not to mention abduction

VIKTOR
Abduction

MAX
I dont buy the whole recluse scam
How are you doing it What is it --
drugs Blackmail Mind-control
All three What do you do -- keep
her locked in a box somewhere

Viktor flinches at the remark

VIKTOR
What is it exactly you want Sayer

MAX
I want to see her Unless you show
me Simone live and in person I show
these pictures to the authorities

Viktor pauses considering the threat

VIKTOR
Alright Sayer youve got a deal

MAX
Er good

MILTON
Thats good

Viktor walks away leaving Max confused

The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Maxs hands and
into the sea

INT CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK

A vast empty stadium On the stage a lone microphone
VIKTOR approaches gazing out at the vast arena Several
PROMOTERS and TECHNICIANS join him

PROMOTER
All ready Mr Taransky This time

right here in front of a packed
house We could have sold it out
twenty times

Viktor nods

TECHNICIAN

I gotta say you ordered an awful
lot of smoke

VIKTOR
Thats the way she likes it

The Promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage
where a barrier has been erected

PROMOTER
After what you told us about the
death threats the security guards
are under strict instructions never
to take their eyes off the crowd

VIKTOR
Excellent

Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a
kiss

VIKTOR
Simone wanted you to have these

TECHNICIAN
(visibly moved by the
gesture)
Wish her luck from us

VIKTOR
Oh I will
(afterthought)
Remember no cameras no
binoculars

EXT STADIUM - NIGHT

In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control
trucktour bus satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights
from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck The
control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd

across the lids

ANNOUNCER is heard

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen Viktor

present live on stage for the
debut concert of the Splendid
Isolation tour the one the only
SI-MONE

A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone standing
alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only
accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage However on
closer inspection the spotlight is actually a laser beam
creating a hologram Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid
the illusion

The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by
the enormous video screens on either side of the stage The
CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons blissfully unaware that
they are watching a pre-recorded event Some watch the event
on portable TVs

INT CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

INT CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

VIKTORs face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied

crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along many in
tears overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters
aloft For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry --

the grand illusionist Viktor is at the height of his
powers

VIKTOR
(to the image of Simone on
his screen)
I dont know about you Simone but
Ive never felt more alive

He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the
Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone
stand

VIKTOR
Damn

He adjusts the beam -- the rapturous crowd transfixed by the
TV screen apparently fails to notice

INT STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT

We focus on a face in the crowd -- MAX SAYER His
journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten Max is singing
along and waving his arms tears rolling down his face swept

ELAINE
Simone

VIKTOR
Shes lying down Shes exhausted

ELAINE
(suddenly cool)

Viktor is confused by their reaction Elaine yanks Lainey
away

ELAINE
Thank Simone for the tickets

LAINEY
(calling back as she is
led away)
It was a great show Dad

Viktor waves disconcertedly

VIKTOR
Where are you going

As he returns to the trailer Viktor catches sight of his
lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the
trailer door He slams the side of the trailer in
frustration

INT ELAINES MANSION - NIGHT

ELAINE paces back and forth in front of her TV showing re-
runs of the SIMONE concert KENT cannot take his eyes off
the screen

ELAINE
I cant believe shes doing this --
taking advantage of him this way
Its cruel

KENT
Why

ELAINE
Obviously this cant last Shes

sensitive Itll destroy him

KENT
Elaine do you realize you cant

at the breaking waves LAINEY joins him

VIKTOR
Hey Lainey

Hows your love life

LAINEY

VIKTOR
You know me -- married to my work
LAINEY
I noticed
An awkward silence
LAINEY

Dad you know I dont like to get
between you and mom but shes
feeling down right now She broke
up with Kent

VIKTOR
(buoyed by the news)
Really Too bad

LAINEY
She thinks youre with Simone

VIKTOR
Lainey you know Simone and I dont
have a real relationship

LAINEY
I know but Mom doesnt Maybe if
it came from Simone if Simone

spoke to Mom -- she could
straighten things out
(shrug)

Dinner maybe

Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter

her years

VIKTOR
Dinner Dinners difficult A
phone call

LAINEY
Too impersonal They have to meet
face-to-face

VIKTOR
Ill see what I can do
(a thought occurs)
You know Lainey I dont believe

Simone Dont you like her

LAINEY
I love her but that doesnt mean I
need to meet her

confused

LAINEY
Why So I can tell my friends at
school -- as if that validates my

life somehow Whats Simone going
to say to a fourteen-year-old
anyhow Shes going to be polite
because youre my father but were
not suddenly going to become
friends -- we have nothing in

Anyhow she gets more beautiful in
my head every day Why kill the
dream What do they say dont

always disappoint you

VIKTOR
I love you Lainey

I love you too daddy

A car horn sounds outside the house

so much wiser than
forehead)

mechanically Elaine waves back They keep driving as they
talk

INT VIKTORS CAR - DAY

The sunglasses-clad SIMONE is a mannequin seated in the
drivers seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her
mouth right hand attached to the steering wheel

Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side VIKTOR drives the
car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering
with one hand occasionally sneaking a glance to the road
ahead He speaks on a phone through the Simone

Viktor losing concentration on his driving

his lane

SIMONE VIKTOR
Id love to stop somewhere but Im
late Im on my way to see Viktor

ELAINE
No I understand Thats what I
want to talk about I dont know
if you know this Simone but
Viktor and I were married once

SIMONE VIKTOR

ELAINE
I think he owes more to you But
thats not important now I know
whats going on between you two

SIMONE VIKTOR
I want to reassure you Elaine
theres absolutely nothing going on
between Viktor and I

ELAINE
(rueful smile)
You dont have to protect my

the last second

My God are you alright Simone

herhis lane)
Yes -- I --

different worlds Thats why I
hope youre not toying with Viktor

SIMONE VIKTOR
It sounds like you still have
feelings for him

ELAINE
We have a daughter together I
just dont want to see Viktor get
hurt

SIMONE VIKTOR
I dont know how many times I have
to say this Elaine but Viktor and
I are not in love
(joking weakly)
I only make love to the camera

ELAINE
Simone I recognize the shirt
youre wearing I gave it to
Viktor on his birthday

Over-correcting his steering Viktor drifts into the next
lane dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve
to avoid him

SIMONE VIKTOR

Christ --

(still struggling to stay

on the road)
Elaine I know how it looks but

(blurting it out)

it would mean a lot to Viktor
if youd go with him to the Oscars
If you wont do it for him please
do it for me

ELAINE
(reluctant frightened by
Simones erratic driving)
Okay -- for you

SIMONE VIKTOR
(sigh of relief)
Thanks This is my exit so I --

ELAINE
Im glad we talked

SIMONE VIKTOR
Good-bye

Viktors car swerves to the right Elaine looks back in her

Elaine just misses the sight of VIKTORs car rear-ending the
truck in front of him

EXT FREEWAY SHOULDER - LATER IN THE DAY

VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the

I also have to thank my co-stars
the studio of course But most of
all I have to thank the audience
for supporting what I do -- youre
the only reason Im here

The CROWD applauds wildly
LAINEY is puzzled She leans over to Viktor

LAINEY
Why didnt she thank you

VIKTOR
(confused)
She did didnt she

ELAINE
(crestfallen)
No

Viktor glances to the Simone sign beside him The blood
drains from his face

INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - MORNING

On the monitor SIMONE reads the forgotten line from the
speech

SIMONE
And of course I must thank my
collaborator Viktor Taransky
without whom none of this would be
possible

VIKTOR still in his tuxedo stares at SIMONE on the screen
He holds the text of Simones acceptance speech in his hands

VIKTOR

(to himself)
Its written right there Why
didnt I say it How could I

forget to say it
Simone stares back at him blankly
A copy of VARIETY is slid under the soundstage door The
front page headline NO THANK YOU - Simone Snubs Taransky At
Oscars

INT VIKTORS CAR - NIGHT

VIKTOR pulls up to the gate of his Malibu home MAX is
standing outside next to his car

VIKTOR
Damn it
EXT VIKTORS MALIBU HOME - NIGHT

VIKTOR also spies an OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair sitting beside
the car MILTON closeby Viktor stops at the gate and
reluctantly exits his car

VIKTOR
What now Sayer

MAX
(smug smile noticing
Viktor noticing the
woman)
Looks familiar doesnt she No
one comes from nowhere Taransky
You turn over enough rocks

The old woman appears drugged stares into space

MAX
I traced her to a nursing home A
young woman fitting Simones
description dropped her off five
years ago

VIKTOR
She looks a lot like you

MAX
(undeterred)
She hasnt uttered a word that
whole time -- until she saw the big

show

Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it in
front of the old lady

OLD LADY
(pointing to Simones
picture catatonic)
My baby My baby

MAX

(putting his hand on his

heart)
Who would think that Saint Simone
would abandon her own mother Ive
been looking into the family
history -- heartbreaking Most
likely a biography to run over four
issues who knows maybe theres
a Pulitzer in there somewhere

Viktor produces his own drivers license and holds it in
front of the old lady

OLD LADY
(pointing to Viktors face
on the drivers license)
My baby My baby

Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady

MAX
That doesnt prove a thing -- wait
until I get a court order for a
blood test

VIKTOR

(sensing an opportunity)
That wont be necessary
(pretending to be
resigned)
Sooner or later I knew youd crack
this thing Max You got me

MAX
I do
(recovering)
Sure I do
(taking Viktor aside)
Can we speak off the record Ima

fair man Im willing to sit down
with her and tell her side of the
story

VIKTOR

I wouldnt want you to compromise
your ethics

MAX
No Thanks Absolutely

Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity

VIKTOR
You love her dont you Max

MAX
Dont you

VIKTOR
(writes a check hands it
Viktor drives into his home Max very confused

to Max)
This should take care of Mother

the old lady

EXT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR escorts LAINEY blindfolded

stares at

around the corner of his

soundstage He removes the blindfold From Laineys point-
of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in ETERNITY

FOREVER

-- the car tied with a bow

VIKTOR
Happy birthday Lainey Do you
like it

LAINEY
(taking in the car)
ts fantastic -- its too much
VIKTOR

ts the car she drove in Eternity
Forever

LAINEY
know Thank her for me

VIKTOR
(disappointed by her
reaction)
Its from both of us Of course
youll have to drive it around the
lot until you get your permit --

Lainey averts her gaze

LAINEY
-- I cant accept it I dont want
a car Dad

VIKTOR
(clearly hurt not
understanding)
Why not I can get you something
else What do you want

LAINEY
The old Viktor Taransky
(finally blurting it out)
I liked you better before -- before
all this You were a loser Dad
but at least you had integrity I
cant stand to see you like this --
clinging to Simones coattails --
it used to be about the work and
now its all about her And then
shes not even grateful enough to
thank you

VIKTOR
No that was me

LAINEY

There you go again blaming
yourself Cant you see what shes
done to you -- shes taking
advantage mocking you You
deserve better than Simone

(hasty exit)
Ive got to go Dad

VIKTOR
Lainey

Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates
INT SIMONE and VIKTORS OFFICE - DAY

VIKTOR leans on his desk still reflecting on LAINEYs
remarks JANE enters

JANE
Ready for your casting session

Viktor nods distractedly Jane shows in NICOLA ANDERS

JANE
Nicolas here for the role of
Simones sister

Viktor offers Nicola a seat staring at her as if he has
never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of
Simone

NICOLA
(slightly uncomfortable by
Viktors scrutiny)
A lots happened since we last saw
each other

VIKTOR
(numb)
Yes
NICOLA
I never apologized properly for
what happened on Sunrise

She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike and
Ike candy including cherry

VIKTOR
Thank you Its not important

NICOLA
After I saw what Simone did with
the role -- you know I fired all my

people went into rehab took
acting classes changed my whole
look She really inspired me

Viktor continues to stare

NICOLA
(referring to the script
in her hands)
Would you like me to read

VIKTOR
Yes Id like that

Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down
She approaches Viktor standing close to him playing the
scene to him -- an immediate intimacy

NICOLA
(her angry words are in
opposition to her amorous
actions)
-- Who do you think you are Carlos
-- coming in here like this With
my husband sleeping in the next
room Do you think I wont call
out Do you think I will just give

in to you without a fight -- like
the last time and the time before
that

(she kisses his ear)
I wish you were dead

(she kisses his lips)
I wish we were both dead

Nicola immediately breaks character

Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with
flesh

VIKTOR
(finally able to speak)
You know youre really very good
I take back what I said I mean
youre really good

NICOLA
Thank you

VIKTOR
(forgetting himself)
You could play the lead

NICOLA
(confused)
But thats Simones part

VIKTOR

Yes of course it is

(gazing at her face)
You know you have a line here Not
a wrinkle Actually more of a
dimple Ive been thinking of
incorporating something like that
in Simone

NICOLA
(incredulous)
Youd cosmetically alter Simone to
look like me

VIKTOR
No of course not youre right
That would be crazy

Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window

NICOLA
Do you want me to do it again

Viktor does not reply Nicola quietly leaves
INT ELAINES MANSION - DAY

The front page of Variety is dominated by a large
photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via
satellite However ELAINE is gazing at a small inset
picture of VIKTOR HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar
Ceremony
Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse
EXT SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTORS SCREEN)

Old home video of ELAINE She is in a garden by a swimming
pool laughing waving and sweetly flirting with the camera
Elaine raises her skirt teasingly winks gestures the camera
operator towards her with a beckoning finger finally blows a
kiss to the camera

INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for
Viktors instructions VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller
monitor -- the home video of ELAINE

Viktor freezes the tape Elaine appears particularly
beautiful

Viktor electronically cuts out Elaines mannerism and morphs
it into Simone Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same
dazzling smile

INT SIMONE and VIKTORS OFFICE - DAY

At her desk JANE is busy trying to mimic Simones hairstyle
as she talks on the phone

JANE
(into phone)
-- Oh sure she comes in all the
time weve become close She
told me --

VIKTOR enters the office

VIKTOR
Jane --

Jane hurriedly hangs up

JANE
Gotta go

VIKTOR
(picking up a pile of
scripts from the in-tray)
Im leaving early tonight If you
need me Ill be at the beach house
having dinner with a certain
someone
Jane tries to conceal her interest As soon as Viktor exits
the office JANE picks up the phone

JANE

(into phone under her
breath)

Elaine Christian please

We reveal VIKTOR outside the door eavesdropping on his
assistant pleased she has taken the bait

INT VIKTORS BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

VIKTOR dims the lights plays mood music The doorbell
rings

He checks himself in the mirror In the reflection he spies
an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE
He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door

ELAINE stands there

ELAINE
Viktor Im picking up Lainey

Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand

VIKTOR
Elaine its Wednesday

ELAINE

(feigning absent

mindedness)
Is it Wednesday Its Wednesday
How embarrassing I dont know
what I was thinking With all the
excitement lately

(peering past him)
Am I interrupting something Are
you expecting company

VIKTOR
(ushering her inside)
As a matter-of-fact I am

ELAINE
When is she coming over

VIKTOR
(glancing to his watch)
About now Would you like a drink
ELAINE
I suppose I could stay just until
she arrives

Elaine takes a seat on the sofa Viktor hands her a glass of
wine and sits beside her -- close

They both knock back their wine in one long gulp both
apparently in need of courage

ELAINE
(trying to make
conversation)
Is Simone back to earth yet

VIKTOR
Not quite

ELAINE
Im sure youll keep her focussed
Shes lucky to have you Viktor
(blurting out)
Is she really having your baby

VIKTOR
Impossible

ELAINE
(instantly regretting the
remark)
I just read somewhere --

VIKTOR
I know I know Theyll say
anything

ELAINE

-- And she was positively glowing
at the awards

(making to leave)
I should be going shell be here
soon --

Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her

VIKTOR
-- She already is Simones not
coming over Elaine Not tonight
not ever
(holding her)
I want you back Elaine
ELAINE
(melting)
I want you back too Viktor

They kiss Elaine breaks the kiss suddenly consumed with
doubt

ELAINE
This is crazy Who am I fooling
cant compete with Simone What
woman can

VIKTOR
would rather have you than
Simone Believe me
ELAINE
Thats sweet Viktor but I
couldnt let you do that -- make

that kind of sacrifice

(meeting his gaze)
ts strange Ive stabbed people
in the back clawed and slept my
way to where I am -- it goes with
the territory -- but for some
reason I cant betray Simone
Theres I dont know any other
way to say it -- theres a goodness
to her

VIKTOR
No there isnt Theres nothing
to her

ELAINE
Oh Viktor You say that now --
because were here alone like
this But in the morning youd go
back to her What man wouldnt

VIKTOR
No I will end my relationship with
her -- totally

ELAINE
But you dont understand Shell
always be there -- at some party

on some magazine cover some song
on the radio up on some screen

VIKTOR
(desperate)
No Shell never work again --
retire never make a movie or a
record or appear ever again

ELAINE
(confused)
Of course she will Her public
will demand it

VIKTOR
Not if I dont let her

ELAINE
You

Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage

VIKTOR
Im going to tell you a secret now
Elaine
(mustering all his nerve)
Simone is not a real person I
invented her

ELAINE

(misinterpreting his

remark)
Every actor is an invention
Viktor Dont embarrass yourself
No ones denying that you
discovered Simone But its like
finding a diamond in the desert
Anyone can trip over it but its
not the finder who sparkles

VIKTOR
(agitated)
-- No no I didnt trip over her
You dont understand --

ELAINE

(ignoring him)
-- You just got lucky that shes
loyal enough to stay with you
Maybe shes staying out of pity
who knows She certainly doesnt
need you Some people even say
youre holding her back

VIKTOR
(wounded)
Who says that --
A pause

(shaking off the insult)
-- Never mind You have to listen
to me Elaine Simone is thin air
pixels molded by me from a
mathematical equation I inherited
it from a madman -- I can show
you --

ELAINE
How much wine have you had

VIKTOR
-- Shes a figment of my own
imagination I Viktor Taransky
have perpetrated the greatest hoax
the greatest sleight-of-hand
sleight-of-mouth sleight-of-
sleight in entertainment history
And still no one appreciates me
recognizes what Ive done -- even
you

ELAINE
(rolling her eyes)
Youre drunker than I thought Are
you doing that again

VIKTOR
No Whatever talent Simone has
comes from me -- me Me I swear

as God is my judge You dont know
what Ive been through Tens of
thousands of mind-numbing hours in
front of that screen nights
without end and look what its
cost me

(producing his spectacles)
Why do you think Ive been wearing
these I may have done irreparable
harm to my eyesight and why To
extract and refine the infinite
nuances of a human being -- a human
soul

(a final explanation)
Dont you see I made Simone

His words hang in the air

ELAINE

You made Simone
(a trace of pity)
Viktor she made you
Elaine gets up and walks out leaving the distraught Viktor
alone in his house

INT VIKTORS OFFICE - DAY

A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office Suddenly he stops and
confronts the standee of SIMONE

VIKTOR
You bitch Ill destroy you

JANE stares in shock She discreetly exits
INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor smiling venomously at
SIMONE He begins to digitally disrobe Simone

MONTAGE

A) Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house
VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash Max finds a
beat up reel of 16mm film

MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop

B) The ECHO headline screams SIMONES HARD CORE PAST and
shows censored film frames of a naked Simone ina
compromising position

VIKTOR hovering at a supermarket check-out line
overhears two WOMEN discussing the article

WOMAN 1
Disgusting

WOMAN 2
(sympathetic)
She must have been so desperate to
do something like that so
depraved

WOMAN 1
Im still naming my baby after her

WOMAN 2
Youre having a boy

WOMAN 1
So
Viktor blanches It is not the reaction hed hoped for
Inside a theater VIKTOR hovers by the door smirking

ON SCREEN we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty
farmyard on all fours grunting like a pig and foraging
for muddy vegetables

The AUDIENCE is shocked then suddenly breaks into
spontaneous applause

Viktor enraged exits into the lobby past the poster for
I AM PIG - Starring Simone

A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera a film poster
behind him

FILM CRITIC
For Simone to do something as brave
as I AM PIG at this point in her

career with so much to lose -- all
I can say is I Am Pig I Am
Oscar

In his soundstage VIKTOR moves a slider that adds
wrinkles to Simone

SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual remote
on a TV screen However her squeaky-clean image has
gone -- hair unkempt bloated chain-smoking and drinking

during the interview The HOSTS are smiling weakly

HOST
Simone thats a rather
controversial position

SIMONE
I just think all elementary schools
should have a firing range -- so

students can learn how to defend
themselves We could fit it
inbetween recess and American
History

Another clip

SIMONE
If theres a hole in the ozone
layer why cant I see it

Another clip
SIMONE
Immigration God isnt it
crowded enough

HOSTS
Just as we always knew Simones
not like other celebrities She

speaks her mind

G) VIKTOR driving along a city street suddenly slams on his
brakes almost causing an accident He stares numbly up
at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a
billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE It
reads SIMONE WOMAN OF THE YEAR

VIKTOR
(to himself)
Shes trying to kill me

Realizing what hes said a thought comes into his eyes
EXT CEMETERY - DAY
An inscription on a headstone reads

HANK ALENO
Remembered Virtually Forever

VIKTOR kneels at HANKs grave He places a bunch of flowers
there

VIKTOR
(referring to the flowers)
Theyre plastic Hank I know
thats the way youd want it
(glancing to a Simone
billboard outside the
cemetery wall)
She killed you Hank Now shes
killing me Shes a serial killer
(ducking out of sight of
the billboard as if
Simone is watching him)
But I dont know how to stop her
Shes taken on a life of her own

I cant just come clean -- make
some confession Ive defrauded
millions -- theyd turn on me And

I cant put the genie back in the
bottle If she stopped working --
dropped out of sight theyd never
let it rest Ive tried to kill
her career but they like her even
more

(more desperate)
What am I going to do Hank

A thought occurs to Viktor He slowly rises from behind
Hanks headstone revealing a forest of headstones

VIKTOR
Dont say another word Hank You
are truly a genius

INT VIKTORS SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK

A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor
SIMONEs face full screen

He speaks into the voice synthesizer Simones face
automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time
he puts his words in her mouth

SIMONE VIKTOR
Whats the matter Viktor You
look so sad Dont you love me
anymore Its over isnt it

He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice

VIKTOR
Its the only way Simone If its
any consolation youre going to
live on in the publics heart like
all the other tragic figures that
went before their time Theres no
love like posthumous love

On the screen Simone is on the verge of tears

VIKTOR

I know what youre thinking Its
a phoney-baloney world The women
are surgically enhanced the
athletes are on steroids the
singers are lip-syncing if theyre
even singing at all the news is
entertainment the politicians are
bought and paid for -- were living
one big lie So why shouldnt you
live too Youre more authentic
than the people who adore you

(a trace of despair)
And thats the problem Youre
looking at the real fraud I told
myself this was all about the work
but if that was the truth it
wouldnt matter to me -- and it
does It wasnt that the artists
had no respect for the art They
had no respect for me Someone
like you you have so much love

showered on you -- I just wanted to
feel one tiny drop on my face Im
sorry Simone Here Ive been

trying to convince the world that
you exist but I was really trying
to convince them that I exist
Its not that you arent human
Simone its that I am

Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked PLAGUE - Ver
81 He places the disc in the machine

Viktor sees that Simone is crying He touches a tear on his
own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own

Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses
ENTER The image of SIMONEs face gradually begins to
deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold
The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen
like dust Finally the dust is blown away in a single
digital breath

For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on
his own desk

Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen
His hard-drive now corrupted he picks up his original disc
marked SIMULATION ONE

He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with
hundreds of discs relating to Simones software He shuts
the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door

EXT SANTA MONICA BAY - DUSK

Viktors yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa
Monica Bay -- SIMONE written on the stern

VIKTOR manhandles the trunk to the railing A mournful pause
-- then he heaves it over the side The trunk sinks like a

stone

Heart heavy Viktor stares into the inky depths

mustering the courage to
ask the question)
How did she die

(pretending to compose
himself)
On her goodwill tour of the third

Did she suffer

VIKTOR
Mercifully it was quick

At the back of the room are MAX SAYER and MILTON They are

Simones coffin is ferried across a bridge by PALLBEARERS
from the studio Numerous MOURNERS follow behind

VIKTOR ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behind
the coffin

VIKTOR
(to Elaine)

ELAINE
(horrified by the
suggestion)
How can you bring that up at a time
like this

The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum A
PRIEST RABBI and a BUDDHIST MONK turn to Viktor He nods
and they start to carry the coffin towards the door
However the coffin is suddenly stopped by a POLICE OFFICER
A SECOND POLICE OFFICER begins to jimmy open the lid The

DETECTIVE

-- Forgive me Mr Taransky
just trying to understand Al

(referring to various

items)
This is fake this is fake --

A fan club with a worldwide
membership in the millions --
bogus

fake

also
VIKTOR
Oh no The fan club is real But
they were worshipping computer code
-- ones and zeros

DETECTIVE
So of course you couldnt kill
Simone because there never was a
Simone

VIKTOR
Of course

DETECTIVE
And this Mr Hank Aleno who you
talk so much about a renowned
failure who also happens to be so
conveniently dead -- perhaps the
man you claim helped invent
Simone is an invention himself

Viktor sensing his sarcasm does not reply

DETECTIVE
(patronizing smile)
But not everyones imaginary are
they Mr Taransky I refer of
course to Edith

VIKTOR
Who

The Detective raises a window-blind to reveal a next door
room where the OLD WOMAN from the rest home is being
interviewed

DETECTIVE
The woman you admitted to a
journalist is Simones mother and
for whose silence you paid a
fortune Is she not flesh to you --
are her tears not wet

The OLD WOMAN glances up and sees all the photos of Simone
through the window

OLD LADY
My BABY

The Detective abruptly lowers the blind Viktor rolls his
eyes at the Detectives theatrics He is suddenly enraged
VIKTOR
Shes insane This whole thing is
insane There is no Simone Look
(grabbing a Simone poster)
Even her name is fake Its not
Simone
(he tears Simones name in
half to demonstrate)
Its SIM ONE Simulation One

The Detectives sadly shake their heads

DETECTIVE 2
(regarding Simones face
also torn in half)
You really hated her didnt you

The Detective places a tape marked EXHIBIT A in a video
machine

DETECTIVE
Perhaps you could explain this to
me Mr Taransky -- or is this tape

doctored too
He plays a tape showing --

VIKTOR dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his
yacht

DETECTIVE

Is that really what you expect us
to believe Mr Taransky

The Detective freezes the tape

DETECTIVE
Can you tell us why you were
disposing of the body of a woman
who didnt exist

VIKTOR
It wasnt her body It was her
body of work

DETECTIVE
Why dont you just come clean
Viktor Tell the truth Youll
feel better afterwards

VIKTOR
I am telling the truth

DETECTIVE
(coming close to him)
We all know what happened Ina
fit of jealous rage you killed
Simone and dumped her body off a
boat she bought for you

VIKTOR
No I can prove it to you Ill
take you to her

EXT BOAT - SANTA MONICA BAY - DAY

VIKTOR sits handcuffed on a POLICE BOAT with the DETECTIVE
and his LAWYER DIVERS surface with the steamer trunk
Viktors face lights up

The trunk is winched aboard However as it lowers onto the
deck we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar All
eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted Apart from
a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty

VIKTOR
(panicky desperately
grabbing the divers)
Did you find anything else --
drivers discs disc-drives

opposite Viktor in his cell VIKTOR is numb -- the

likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him

LAWYER
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself
on the mercy of the court Its
the best deal youre going to get

VIKTOR
(incredulous)
I could get the death penalty

You certainly will if you go to

through Viktors files All empty

Lainey sighs ELAINE paces behind her

ELAINE
Lets go Lainey Theres nothing
here

LAINEY

Just a minute
Elaine continues to pace as Lainey works

ELAINE
God its so like your father Why
cant people take responsibility
for their actions anymore I can
almost forgive him for killing
Simone -- but denying her
existence I can never forgive
that

LAINEY

Because obviously she existed
right

ELAINE
I know it as surely as youre
sitting here sweetheart She was
the most vital woman I ever met

LAINEY
So you did meet her

ELAINE
Of course What are you
suggesting

LAINEY
I mean really meet her -- in the
flesh

Elaine regards her daughter curiously

LAINEY
I know its embarrassing to admit
it mom but when I think about it
-- honestly I havent I mean it
feels like I have I know more
about her than members of my own
family Shes even in my dreams
But I realized going back through
my diary they were all TV
appearances near misses at
parties second-hand rumor gossip
on the internet Ive never
actually seen Simone up close
touched her been in her physical
presence Have you

ELAINE
(unable to refute it)
Well I --
LAINEY

-- We dont believe daddy because
we dont want to believe we were
taken in too

ELAINE
(trying to shake the
notion from her head)
Lainey theres no evidence that
Simone isnt real

LAINEY
Listen to what youre saying mom

Is there any evidence she is

Lainey finally tries another file She presses EJECT The
PLAGUE disc spits out of the machine

LAINEY

(regarding the disc)
Theres one part of dads story

while his LAWYER lays out his trial strategy

VIKTOR fuming throughout this

LAWYER
(hushed tones referring
to a thick Psychiatric

Report)

Listen Ive found a
psychiatrist in Ventura -- well
respected -- whos willing to

testify under oath that you have
diminished capacity due to the
trauma of your divorce ten years
of abject failure in the movie
business and a bump on the head you
sustained as a child --

VIKTOR
-- No I cant go along with this
horseshit Just tell them they can
fry me

LAWYER
(aghast looking around to
see if anyone has heard)

VIKTOR
It was premeditated -- I knew
exactly what I was doing I
strangled her I bludgeoned her
I set her on fire I did it I
killed her

DETECTIVE (0S)

suddenly explodes
(clearing his throat)
Excuse me

The Lawyer spins around guiltily The Detective stands
outside the cell clearly overhearing the confession
Viktor resigned to his fate couldnt care less

The Detective switches on the TV set hanging outside the
cell VBC is playing -- BREAKING NEWS --

VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE LAINEY sits opposite studying
her laptop computer Outside the car REPORTERS are pressed
against the glass

VIKTOR
(relaxing back into his
seat)
Thank you
(to Lainey)
I dont know how you did it but
thank you

ELAINE
(putting her arm around
him)
Dont thank us too fast Viktor
You know what we have to do

VIKTOR
(resigned smile)
Why stop at one character when you
can have a whole cast

ELAINE
Exactly Now that you have the
studio behind you we can really do
things

Viktor shrugs resignedly savoring his freedom

ELAINE
(holding Viktor close)
I was thinking -- what about you
and Simone moving back in with

me and Lainey

VIKTOR
(meeting her gaze)
That sounds wonderful
(to Lainey)
How do you feel about all this
Lainey

LAINEY
(beaming)

VIKTOR
(reluctant admission)
Me and Simone What I did

LAINEY
(sweet smile)
Your mistake wasnt making
something fake daddy Were fine
with fake -- as long as you dont
lie about it

Once again his daughters words have a ghastly ring of truth
Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually
forces its way through the reporters

He recognizes MAX and MILTON amongst the mob Max has
hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the
window --

WILL PAY FOR EXCLUSIVE Viktor looks away

ELAINE
(kissing him on the cheek)
Dont look so glum Viktor Its
not a death sentence

VIKTOR
(still staring out of the
window a rueful smile)
No its life

INT FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - DAY

FRANK BRAND conducts a remote interview with SIMONE who
appears as usual on a television monitor

FRANK BRAND
-- Simone the question on
everyones mind is simply why

SIMONE
Frank you know as well as I do
living in a fish bowl the
insatiable appetite of the media
Frank nods sympathetically

SIMONE
With everything that was going on
in my life I just needed to drop

out of sight for a while -- I
needed time Viktor bought me that
time I owe him so much

FRANK BRAND

We all do

(quickly returning to

Simone)
But now I understand youre eager
to get back to work -- and not the
kind of work that were all
expecting

SIMONE
(smiles coyly)
Thats true I can reveal that I
am considering a career in
politics

FRANK BRAND
And what may I ask brought this on

SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera

SIMONE

I suppose this little man had
something to do with it Viktor

going to grow up in
