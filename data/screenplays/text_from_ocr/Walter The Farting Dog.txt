EXT SUBURBAN STREET -- DAY

An animal control truck rumbles down the road But its no
ordinary city truck This one is personalized On the side
is its airbrushed name The Critter Catcher

INT CRITTER CATCHER -- SAME TIME

This doesnt look like the average city truck on the inside
either Its tricked out -- new stereo killer speakers
GPS navigational system the works Its somebodys baby

Behind the wheel an animal control worker whose nametag
identifies him as KARL scans the neighborhood Head on a
swivel as he searches for any strays

EXT SUBURBAN STREET -- CONTINUOUS

As the truck passes various houses even dogs that are
standing in their own front yard dart behind a tree or the
nearest covering to hide Can never be too careful when
Karl and the Critter Catcher are in the neighborhood

INT CRITTER CATCHER -- CONTINUOUS

As Karl keeps glancing from side to side in the passenger
seat next to him his dimwitted co-worker LARRY chows down
on a burrito and slurps on a Big Gulp

LARRY
Man I hate cats

KARL
Yeah well never lead with your
head looking under a porch

Larry nods and turns to take another bite of his burrito
revealinga biq paw scrape down the side of his face

KARL (CONTD)
Thats animal control 101 Lar--

PFFFFT Somebody farts Bad Karl grabs his nose and
reaches for his window handle rolling it down just as fast
as he can

KARL (CONTD)
Dude if youre gonna do that you
gotta give a courtesy warning

LARRY
What are you talking about I didnt--
Sweet mother of God

Larry starts gagging and lurches for his own window quickly
rolling it down and sticking his head outside asap

EXT CRITTER CATCHER -- CONTINUOUS
The truck swerves back and forth as it snakes down the road

Karl and Larry both have their heads jutting out of the
windows gasping for air like they were just maced

Oncoming cars honk and dodge out of the way barely missing
being hit by the out-of-control truck

Even the animals who were hiding moments before peek out to
watch the wild ride

INT CRITTER CATCHER -- CONTINUOUS

Inside the truck things arent any better The burrito is
now part of the windshield the Big Gulp is now part of Karls
shirt

As Karl and Larry veer down the road heads still out the
window they suddenly SCREAM

The guys whip their heads back inside at the last possible
moment as their vehicle barely squeezes between two oncoming
semis instantly sheering off the side mirrors on each door

The terror of that near-miss causes Karl to take his eyes
off the road for just a moment But its enough as the truck
jumps the nearest curb causing Scream Part II

KARL LARRY
Aaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhhhhh

Out the windshield reveal the truck barreling toward a used
car dealership

EXT USED CAR LOT -- CONTINUOUS

Customers and employees dive out of the way as the animal
control truck races toward the cars and certain disaster

But somehow Karl manages to fishtail the truck to a screeching
halt before it can hit any cars barely tapping into the

base of the dealerships large Atlas Motors sign -- An old
car propped up vertically on its back bumper with a giant
metal globe atop its front bumper

The car wobbles - once twice - but doesnt fall Whew
However Karl and Larrys relief is short-lived
INT CRITTER CATCHER -- CONTINUOUS

PFFFT Another fart causes Karl to accidentally hit the
gas The truck lurches forward SMACKING into the sign once
more They each look up just in time to see the giant globe
teeterbefore rolling off the car and

BLAM Smashing down on the hood of the Critter Catcher
leaving a huge crater as a giant crack spiderwebs up the
center of the windshield

Karls eyes go wide in horror before he starts pounding the
steering wheel in frustration his once-beautiful truck now
ruined Moving through the mesh wire separating Karl and
Larry from the caged animals in the back of the truck find

A stray collarless dog -- plump mutt really -- sitting off
in the corner Alone All the other dogs trying to stay as
far away as possible from him

The matting of the dogs fur suggests its been on its own
for quite some time And while the animals coat appears to
be gray the poor thing is so dirty it could actually be
somewhat white after a good bath (or two or three)

As the dog we will come to know as Walter farts yet again
EXT SUBURBAN STREET -- SAME TIME

A MOVING VAN sits in the street tired movers unload chairs
clothes exercise equipment you name it and hustle them to
the house as fast as their weary arms and legs will allow

INSIDE THE MOVING VAN TOM a workaholic in his late 30s40
and his overworked homemaker wife ARLENE late 30s40 survey
the items still to be hauled to their new house Pointing
at an antler hat rack

ARLENE
You did not keep that thing

TOM
(points)
You kept the yard gnome

ARLENE
Thats different Thats a
decoration

TOM
Yeah if we lived in a trailer park

BETTY (0S)
Mom Dad

Tom and Arlene look to see their 10 year old daughter BETTY
being chased out the front door by her 10 year old fraternal
twin brother BILLY whos shooting at her with a SUPER SOAKER
WATER GUN

TOM
Billy

BILLY
She took the bigger room

BETTY
It has a built-in desk Like he
knows how to study

SQUIRT SQUIRTSQUIRT He blasts her again

ARLENE
Knock it off before somebody loses
an eye

Billy looks down at his Super Soaker From a squirt gun

Tom hands Billy a box marked Billys Room then gives Betty
one with Bettys Room written on it The kids wheel around
and march toward the house As they trudge up the steps

BETTY
Creep

BILLY
Jerk

NEAR THE VAN Tom turns to his wife

TOM
And you wanted three

ARLENE
dust give me my yard gnome

INT COLEMAN HOUSE -- LATER

Boxes are stacked everywhere Furniture haphazardly sits in
whatever room it was placed when the movers gave up

Tom and Arlene enter trying to navigate through the foyer
with a large box the yard gnome on top Just then the
Blackberry on Toms belt buzzes He pauses to try to answer
it while still maneuvering with the box

ARLENE
Hurry its heavy I--Watch out for
that --
CRASH Tom knocks over a vase breaking it

ARLENE (CONTD)
Tom I said watch out

TOM
After I was already stepping Thats
a pretty useless warning Arlene

ARLENE
Maybe if you didnt answer your
Blackberry while were moving

TOM
Bigger job more responsibility

SMASH The box they were carrying slips out of Arlenes
hands and crashes to the ground

TOM (CONTD)
Whatd you do that for

ARLENE
Oh like I did it on purpose Tom
It slipped

TOM

Maybe we should just break everything
Just then Billy marches back down the steps Overhearing

BILLY
If it means we dont have to move
anymore Im all for it

TOM
Tell you what when you bring home
the paycheck you can choose where
we live deal

BILLY
Whatever

TOM
How bout the size of that yard

Going to have a lot of fun exploring
out there

BILLY
Thats what you said at our place
last year

TOM
Look I know its not easy being the
new kids
BILLY

Again
ARLENE

Its hard we understand honey
BILLY

How many times did you move growing

up mom
Arlene doesnt answer Which is her answer
BETTY
(coming down the steps)
I calculated well go to 68 schools
before we graduate from high school

BILLY
Yeah and then what about college

BETTY
College doesnt work like that Billy

BILLY
How would you know Youre 10

BETTY
Because Im smarter than you

BILLY
Yeah in a dumb way Youre--

TOM
Hey hey hey Guys Think of all
the new friends youre going to meet
at your new school
And as Billy just shakes his head
INT SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING

A sea of unfriendly faces stare forward Reveal

Billy and Betty having just gotten on The kids keep staring
Billy and Betty just stand there Until

BUS DRIVER
New kids

Billy gives him a subtle nod

BUS DRIVER (CONTD)
I was a new kid
suddenly the bus driver starts reliving a memory from his
own private hell

BUS DRIVER (CONTD)
No Not the locker Not the locker
(snapping back grips
the steering wheel)
Youll be fine Just keep your head
down Dont call attention to
yourself

Billy and Betty slowly start making their way down the aisle
Everyone staring at these two oddities No one offering up
any seats

Suddenly aloud massive fart rips through the bus timed
perfectly to make it seem like Billy or Betty did it
Everyone on the bus starts giggling at The New Kids

In a nearby seat Billy glances over at a big husky kid he
will unfortunately come to know as GREG SWAN Greg was held
back a year for sporting reasons by his father in first
grade And at 11 he already has the hint of a mustache

Billy notices Greg trying to conceal a whoopee cushion in
his hands

BILLY
Hey We didnt--

But before he can finish his sentence Greg gives another
giant squeeze to the whoopee cushion

THHHFFFFT

The fart sound and ensuing laughter drown out Billys
response And just when it cant get any worse it does

ARLENE (0S)
Wait Wait

Arlene still in her robe runs to the bus Climbing on

ARLENE (CONTD)
You forgot your lunches

She gives them to her kids kisses them on the cheeks then
starts to leavebut not before licking her fingers to
smoothe Billys hair the dreaded mom comb-your-hair-with-
spit routine And as the laughter starts up again

INT ANIMAL SHELTER -- LATER

Two rows of animal cages line a narrow corridor dogs barking
on either side

Find Karl coming down the aisle with a younger overweight
METER MAID whos walking a little dog

METER MAID
So this old lady with a walker
comes out as Im writing the ticket
Says somebody took all the handicapped
spots and she didnt have any change
for the meter Like thats my fault
right Boo hoo

Karl stops and stares at this woman Did he hear her right
But hes not appalled Quite the contrary He mightve
just found his soulmate

KARL
I like your style

METER MAID
dust doing my job

Yep shes the one
His cohort Larry passes with some golf clubs and a blender

LARRY
Got three offers for the golf clubs
on eBay so far Nothing on the
blender yet

Karl nods but turns his attention right back to the Meter
Maid Larry gives his co-worker a subtle thumbs up

METER MAID
Dont know what I wouldve done if
anything happened to Snickers here
Hes my baby Got him five months
ago to replace the dog I used to be
married to

Karl gives her joke a courtesy laugh All part of their
white trash mating ritual

KARL
Yeah well just glad to be of
service Lucky I caught her
yesterday And I think she enjoyed
her brief stay here

Unseen by the Meter Maid Snickers snarls at Karl And when
the Meter Maids not looking Karl snarls right back

METER MAID
So did you catch all these dogs
yourself
KARL
Most of ‘em

METER MAID
Wow

KARL

Know ‘em like I know my own kids

If I had kids Or liked kids
(points)

See that Doberman Tear your arm

off But give him a Snausage and a

scratch behind the right ear You

got total control

Karl points at a particularly mean looking German Shepherd
barking away Karl pulls a treat out of his pocket

KARL (CONTD)
Thunder door

Karl claps and holds up the treat Thunder immediately stops
barking jumps up and opens the unlocked latch on her cage
Karl smiles at the Meter Maid having proven his mastery as

he leads Thunder back into her cage

METER MAID
You train the pound dogs too
KARL
My little gift to the community
METER MAID
Impressive
KARL

Just doing my job

METER MAID
Youre like Noah But without a boat

KARL
Yeah Ive heard that

They stop near the end of the corridor in front of Karls
office Its as decked out as his truck - great stereo new
TV even an Xbox

METER MAID
Wow Nice office

KARL
Work hard to play hard

She smiles

KARL (CONTD)
You know if you have any questions
aboutcontrolling your animal we
could get together after work and I
could share my professional insights

She smiles Coy
KARL (CONTD)
I could come over and you know
train your pet for ya
Hearing that Snickers runs behind the Meter Maids legs

KARL (CONTD)
Show you how I

But just when Karl leans in to make his move
PFFFFFT
A fart rips through the shelter behind him The Meter Maid

starts coughing The silence - and mood - is further shattered
when the other dogs begin barking howling in protest

METER MAID
Uh I better get going
KARL
That wasnt--
METER MAID

plugging her nose)
Its been swell But my shift farts
soon-- starts soon

The Meter Maid turns and scampers off down the hall her dog
in tow as the barking becomes even louder

Pissed Karl turns to seeWalter staring at him through
his cage He wags his tail Karl pulls out a dog whistle
and blows silencing the pound

KARL
Because of that little stunt there
will be no snacks this morning
Thismutt down here ruined it for
everybody

The barking starts up again as if the animals can understand
Karl turns back to Walter

KARL (CONTD)
First my ride then my lady friend
Now its personal

Karl makes a youre gonna get it sound along with a slashing
motion across his neck

KARL (CONTD)
(winks)
Have a good day

And off Walters terrified look
INT CLASSROOM -- LATER

Billy and Betty stand in front of the blackboard their twenty-
something teacher MS SCHEMBRI nearby at her desk Its
obvious they want to be anywhere but in front of everybody

MS SCHEMBRI
Ok class I want you to welcome our
new students Betty and Billy Coleman

But much like the bus the other students just stare at them
Except for AMY the class brown-nose with glasses sitting
in the front row

AMY
Hi Betty Hi Billy

MS SCHEMBRI
Thank you Amy Class

CLASS
in monotone unison)
Hi Betty Hi Billy

Ms Schembri smiles like she just brought peace to the Middle
East Betty moves to sit down but Ms Schembri isnt done

MS SCHEMBRI
Hold on hold on
(to the class)
Billy and Betty are fraternal twins
Does anybody know what that means

Silence

But Amys arm shoots into the air And from Ms Schembris
look its obvious that happens every question She purposely
keeps scanning the room as Amy furiously waves her hand

AMY
Ooh ooh ooh I think I know I
think I know

MS SCHEMBRI
Anybody else besides Amy for a change

Amy looks crushed But she glances around Surely no one
but her knows Until near the back of the room Greg Swan
raises his hand

MS SCHEMBRI (CONTD)
Yes Greg

GREG
Does it mean
(points at Billy)
Hes kind of a girl too

The class giggles

MS SCHEMBRI
Greg No thats not what it means

Sensing an opening Amys hand shoots back in the air

MS SCHEMBRI (CONTD)
All right Amy what--

But before she can answer and continue the humiliation Betty
launches right in

BETTY
Fraternal twins are siblings who
have shared a common uterine
environment Also known as dizygotic
twins they can be of the same sex
such as two boys or two girls or
they can be different genders like
my brother and I

The class and Ms Schembri just stare at this little brainiac
Amy slowly lowers her arm She wasnt even going to sniff

an answer like this But Bettys not done Not even close
Because when she gets nervous she talks

BETTY (CONTD)
Fraternal twins are created after
fertilization of two different female
ova by different male sperm Sperm
or spermatozoa which is the long
fertilizing gamete of a male is
produced when the male p--

MS SCHEMBRI
Uh thank you Betty I think
weget it As youobviously do
You uh can finish your explanation
some other time Like in 9th grade

Billy shakes his head This wont endear them to the class

BILLY
Can we sit down now

MS SCHEMBRI
Yes Please Sit Everybody sit
Justsit

Billy and Betty shuffle to find empty seats Passing Greg

GREG
Freaks

INT ANIMAL SHELTER -- SAME TIME

Instead of the noisy chaos its surprisingly quiet But
not due to Karls dog whistle All the dogs are on their
best behavior because

KARL (0S)
Got all kinds of pets here

Reveal Karl leading a YUPPIE FAMILY down the aisle as they
search for a pet

KARL (CONTD)
Big ones Small ones Dogs
Cats Even some hamsters over in
Rodent Rescue Comes with one of
those treadmill cage thingies too
Totally free

YUPPIE FATHER
Our Samantha has her heart set ona
dog

As the father mother and their daughter walk past all the
doggie stalls each dog does something adorable in its
cage as if to say Pick me

One jumps up and down like it has springs in its paws His
neighbor rolls over and plays deadthen hops back up The
next dog stands on its hind legsand takes a few steps

In fact it seems that at each cage the things the dogs are
doing get more and more complex

Yet even with all these skills on display Samantha and her
parents are non-committal They carefully size each one of
the dogs up until coming to

WALTERS CAGE

Since all the other dogs used up all the wacky pet tricks
Walter decides to go old school sitting in his cage tongue
out being a normal ol dog

SAMANTHA
Hello puppy

Walter barks in reply as if to say Hello back

The family stops Looks at him He waves his paw Smart
dog Hes definitely not the cutest dog in the pound But
theressomething about him Sensing hes being sized up
Walter barks again his tail wagging

Samantha approaches his cage

Excited Walter rushes forward for the pat on the head hes
sure will come But in his excitement

PFFFT Walter lets out a small fart

SAMANTHA (CONTD)
Ewwwwwwwww

Samanthas father quickly grabs her hand leading her back
down toward the other dogs as Walter realizing he screwed
up again slinks back to the corner of his cage Heartbroken

As the family leaves Karl lingers just long enough to give
Walter a disgusted shake of his head

KARL
Nice going mutt
(taps his new watch)
Tick tock tick tock Time she is
a ticking

Karl leaves a big smirk on his face And as Walter looks
at his rumbling stomach locked up in his cage

EXT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- LATER

That mass exodus at the end of the day Children stream out
and head for home via foot bus or waiting parents

Among the horde of students fleeing school for the day find
Billy Looks like the day didnt get any better Following
him outside

BETTY
Are you going to wait up

BILLY
Why So you can tell everybody were
the new dyslexic twins

BETTY
Dizygotic

BILLY
Whatever Did you have to show off
What good did that do

BETTY
It wasnt showing off it was helping
us sit down faster So we didnt
have to just stand there And you
know when I get nervous I talk and--

BILLY
Exactly We talked about this So
just be quiet 1
He trails off stopped in his tracks

BETTY
What

She glances up to see her brother staring at the dreaded
yellow bus near the curb Waiting for them

Greg Swan piles on pushing a smaller kid out of the way in
order to board first As he disappears inside

GREG
Wheres that twin freak

And on Billys look of fear
EXT NEIGHBORHOOD -- MOMENTS LATER

The school bus rumbles past at the end of the street But
Reveal Billy and Betty a couple blocks away Walking home

BETTY
This is stupid Its almost two
miles

BILLY

So Mom said Grandpa used to walk
20 miles each way to school In the
snow

BETTY
Thats just an expression

BILLY
Like common uterine environment

BETTY
I shouldve taken the bus

BILLY
I didnt ask you not to
(mocking)
Hi everyone Im Betty Coleman
This bus weighs 68 tons and--

BETTY
Maybe if you listened to Dad and
tried--

BILLY

Dad What does he know If his
first day of work was like school
then maybe hed understand

SMASH CUT TO FANTASY SEQUENCE
EXT COLEMAN HOUSE -- MORNING

Tom waits out front of their house in his suit when

SCREEEEECH A bus rumbles to a halt right in front of him
Its door ominously swings open Tom hesitates before
cautiously stepping on the bus to find

INT BUS -- CONTINUOUS

A bus full of business execs all reading the Wall Street
Journal In unison they each lower their papers and stare
at Tom who doesnt move Terrified

The same bus driver the kids had (who now wears a suit and
tie) turns to him

BUS DRIVER
First day on the job
(off Toms nod)
I remember my first day
(remembering)
No I dont want to come in Saturdays
I dont want to work weekends
(snapping back)
Youll be fine Just dont leave
the paper tray empty after using the
copier And refill the coffee pot
if you take the last cup Thats a
biggie

Tom nods and starts to step down the aisle when

BILLY Dad Wait

Tom turns to see his son racing from their house toward the
bus He hurries up the steps

BILLY (CONTD)
You forgot your briefcase

Before leaving he licks his fingers to wipe a speck of dirt
off his dads face And as all the other execs laugh

END FANTASY SEQUENCE AND CUT BACK TO
EXT NEIGHBORHOOD -- AFTERNOON

Where Billy and Betty continue on their trek home

BETTY
dust because you didnt stand up for
yourself--

If this were a cartoon this is the part that the steam would
come out of the characters head because

BILLY
You want to know what the real
definition of fraternal twins is
It means Im stuck with you forever

And as Billy marches off the other way leaving his sister
EXT TOMS CAR -- LATER

Tom drives home but his works not done Or safe because
INT TOMS CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Tom has his cellphone cradled against his neck typing away
on his Blackberry in his left hand in addition to checking a
spreadsheet on his laptop with his right hand All while
balancing a large coffee tucked between his legs

TOM
(into phone)
Yes I got the email
(working the Blackberry)
Im looking at it right now
(typing on the laptop)
No those arent the figures I have

Still holding the Blackberry Tom makes a bold grab for his
coffee while attempting to steer with his knee Success

TOM (CONTD)
(takes a sip)
Heres what Im working off of

But setting the coffee back between his legs the lid pops
off Attempting to put it back onhis cellphone slips off
his shoulder and -- plop -- lands right in the coffee cup

TOM (CONTD)
Son of a--

Attempting to fish it out the glow of a police siren as he
turns on his street immediately puts his focus back on the
road Three police cars sit in front of a house

He rolls down his window and slows next to an OFFICER standing
near his squad car

TOM (CONTD)
What happened

INT TOM AND ARLENES BEDROOM -- LATER

Arlene - on her back feet in the air - works out with that
resistance tubing folks like Suzanne Sommers sell on latenight
TV as

ARLENE
Fourth break-in this month
(stops in mid-exercise)
Oh thats just perfect Here

TOM
They even tied up the old man who
lived there while they cleaned the
place out

ARLENE
Do the police have any leads

TOM
Just one its somebody really good
because after four break-ins they
dont have a clue

INT ANIMAL SHELTER -- DAY

Walter looks through his cage to see an elderly couple
excitedly taking the hind legs walking dog home The
ELDERLY WOMAN cradles him in her arms as they leave

ELDERLY WOMAN
And we have a big backyard for
you to play in And were installing
a doggie door for you And well

As the woman goes on and on about the wonderful life hind

-Karl slaps a big red tag on Walters cage Reveal its
A TAG FOR TERMINATION

KARL
End of the line sport

As the other dogs whine in sympathy for one of their own
EXT BILLY AND BETTYS NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY
-A number of neighborhood kids zoom past on their bikes

NEIGHBORHOOD KID
Hurry up everybodys going to the
park

The other kids pedal faster lest the park suddenly disappear
before they reach it Reveal they race past

Billy - on his bike exploring his new neighborhood - who
watches the kids go by hoping for an invitation from his
classmates that never comes

EXT LOCAL PARK -- DAY

As the kids from above congregate off in a corner of the
park hanging out and playing with their dogs reveal

Billy watching them through the fence when suddenly

RAAA-RAAA-RAAAA A snarling beast of a dog jumps at the
fence right in front of him causing Billy to tumble backwards
tripping over his bike and falling to the ground

As the dog continues barking at Billy trying to gnaw its
way right through the fence to get him

BOYS VOICE (0S)
(laughs)
Cmon Brutus Dont pick on half-
girls

Greg Swan yanks on the spiked collar of his Rottweiler
struggling to control him as Billy pulls himself up

But Brutus breaks free and lunges at the fence sending Billy
tumbling over once more Greg laughs again and jerks up
hard on Brutuss collar causing the dog to choke but comply

As they head toward the other kids Billy watches Greg and
Brutus hold court The other kids cautiously approach to
pet Brutus peasants lining up to kiss the kings ring

INT COLEMAN HOUSE -- LATER

Arlene talks on the phone and puts things in the fridge as
the Colemans finish dinner

ARLENE
(on phone)
Cant wait to see you and meet my
little nephew sis

BETTY
And I was reading how worms affect
plant growth

TOM
(checks his Blackberry)
Thats great sweetie

ARLENE

(wrapping up her call)
Ok Uh huh You too Mmm hmm
Alrighty Uh huh Ok Buh-bye

(hanging up)
Kids your Aunt Kaye says hello

(back to mom mode)
Betty clean your plate Billy eat

darn Blackberry

He doeslooking at it until the last possible second But
Billy keeps picking at his carrots Finally

BILLY
I think we should get a dog

Everyone looks at Billy

TOM
You do huh

Billy nods

TOM (CONTD)
Theyre a lot of work you know
Somebody has to take care of them
all the time

BILLY
I dont mind I couldgo to the
park with him

Tom has no idea the true meaning behind what his son is
saying But before he can even inquire

BETTY
Oooh Or maybe we could get a cat

Billy is horrified at the suggestion

BILLY
A cat Cats aredumb pets

BETTY
A cats brain is more similar to a
mans brain than a dogs Both cats
and humans have identical areas in
the brain responsible for emotion

Advantage Betty Billy searches for a response Finally

BILLY
So How do you even know such stupid
stuff

BETTY

Maybe if you watched the Discovery
Channel sometime instead of just MT--

TOM
Guys guys guys I dont think its
a good idea right now But well

Typical dad response Billy grabs his plate and trudges off
toward the kitchen

INT TOM AND ARLENES BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Tom lays in bed working on his laptop as

TOM
Last thing we need eh

ARLENE (0S)
First thing hes been excited about
since we moved here

TOM

Ar please All kids have a tough
time at first But I guarantee before
you know hell have so many friends
to go to the park with he wont

Ding ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN an email pops up in Toms
inbox under the headline STOP WORKING

Puzzled he looks up to see his wife come out of their
bathroom holding his Blackberry She smiles Seductive

Tom smiles back when - Ding - another email alert sounds
Unable to fight this addiction Tom does the unthinkable and
glances away from his wife and back down at his laptop
Arlene crawls into bed angrily prepping her side as

ARLENE

You know Tom its hard being the
new wife everytime we move too

(then)
And with all the recent break-ins in
the neighborhood I dont know why
its not a good idea to have a doggie
warning system

And as this finally gets Tom to look up from his computer
INT ANIMAL SHELTER -- DAY

Billy and Betty run ahead of their dad down the corridor of
dog cages shelter worker Larry trailing along

They are met by a lot of empty cages Most of the dogs from
before are gone having already found homes

As the kids continue down the aisle Karl leads Walter out
of his cage Walter looks at the kids as he passes Catching
glances with the sad-eyed dog

BETTY
Where are you taking that one
KARL
Hes going to that big dog pound in
the sky
BETTY
Why
KARL

Nobody wants him

BETTY
Whats his name

KARL
Doesnt even have a name Thats
why hes here Nobody liked him
enough to give him one

BETTY
(to Billy re Walter)
What about that one

Billy sizes up Walter

BILLY
Where are all thecool dogs

LARRY
Had a big run lately

Billy walks over to another cage where a lab mix sits

BILLY
Can I see him

LARRY
Sorry Already taken Familys
coming to pick him up later

Karl starts leading Walter away The dog tries fighting his
fate planting his paws but Karl simply pulls him along

As Betty watches Walter who keeps looking back toward them
she gets an idea

BETTY
Where do you keep the cats

Billys eyes go wide
LARRY
Right this way
(rubs his facial scrape)
Got a bunch athem vicious beasts

As Larry points them toward the cat corridor Billy looks
back at Walter

Desperate and sensing this is his last chance Walter fights
the gas building in his stomach and tries to do all the doggie
tricks the other dogs did See Im like every other dog

But being a bit klutzy he cant quite do the tricks right
as Karl pulls him away Billys heart melts

BILLY
Wait

Karl and Walter stop Both looking back

BILLY (CONTD)
Thats my dog

And as Betty smiles
EXT COLEMAN HOUSE -- LATER

The kids and Walter race toward the front door as Tom gets
out of their car

INT COLEMAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
As Billy Betty and Walter run inside that mom sensor sounds

ARLENE (0S)
Dont run in the house

BILLY
Mom mom mom I got a dog

BETTY

Coming down the steps with a bucket of bathroom cleaning
supplies

ARLENE
Thats great Let me see what--

Spotting sad-looking plump Walter shes visibly startled

ARLENE (CONTD)

Billy smiles as Arlene exchanges looks with Tom whos come
up behind them This is the dog you let them get Tom
shrugs Nothing I could do Arlene bends to pet him

ARLENE (CONTD)
He--
(covering her nose)
Smells awful

BETTY

BILLY
Me neither Its probably just his
natural scent

Reveal Tom and Arlenes eyes both starting to water

ARLENE
Why dont you go give him a natural
bath

BILLY
Cmon boy

INT BASEMENT -- LATER

Where just a pair of dog eyes are the only thing visible
of Walter in the utility sink Yet even still

Glug glug glug Billy pours more shampoo in the sink

BILLY
Now dont let it get in your eyes

Woof Walter barks wags his tail and leaps up to lick Billy
but loses his balance and disappears underneath the bubbles
only to pop up a second later rubbing his soap-filled eyes
with his paws

BILLY (CONTD)
I told ya klutz Stuff stings

Betty comes down the steps and watches from the staircase

BETTY
What are we going to name him

BILLY
We It was my idea to get a dog

But Betty doesnt budge Instead she pulls a baby name
book out from behind her back Starts flipping through it

BILLY (CONTD)

BETTY
Mom got it for Aunt Kaye but forgot
to send it And since hes gonna be
more a friend than a dog figure

BILLY
Baby names There arent any good
dog names in there

BETTY

Walter

And as the tail wags so much it starts spewing bubbles all
over Billy

SLOW MOTION of Walter shaking all the water off him spraying
Billy and Betty But far from getting mad they laugh

BILLY (CONTD)
Do it again

Billy pours more water on the dog who again does the wet
doggie shimmy giving the now-soaked kids giggle fits once
more Just then Arlene comes down the steps to retrieve
some gardening gear

BETTY
Mom meet Walter

She sees the dogs soaking wet Knows he just got a bath
And yet

ARLENE
Walter still stinks

CUT TO
Billy once again filling up the utility sink with water
Just as it gets to the point where its covering up Walters

body bubbles rise from below the waters surface

Knowing what caused them Billy and Betty giggle Until

More bigger fart bubbles float up actually popping upon
reaching the surface POP POP POP

Now Betty and Billys eyes go wide This isnt good

BETTY

Uh oh That cant be normal
BILLY

I think were gonna need stronger

soap

Billy scans the basement when a rattling noise above causes
Walter to look up

BILLY (CONTD)
Thats just the laundry chute

Suddenly some clothes drop from above and land next to the
LAUNDRY DETERGENT And on Billys forming smile

CUT TO
Detergent being poured in the running washing machine

BILLY (CONTD)
(to Walter)
I wont stick you all the way in

BILLY
Why Because it wasnt yours

Betty turns and stomps back up the steps as Billy pours some
detergent in Thinks Adds a little more Then a little
more What the heck he puts the entire box in

And as the wash machine churns and chugs away bubbles
starting to form

EXT COLEMAN HOUSE -- LATER

Arlenes head keeps bouncing into frame Reveal her pulling
weeds along the house when a rising wall of bubbles starts
to seep out of the basement window

met by a wall of white bubbles spilling into the kitchen

ARLENE

No answer Finally next to them

BETTY
Billy used too much laundry detergent

From the basement

TOM (CONTD)
Nevermind

Using the fart as a beacon Tom walks right up to Billy

BILLY

TOM
(holding his nose)
It was easy
INT KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

Arlene eyes Billy and Tom who are covered in bubbles Shakes

Walter wags his tail then try as he might not to he farts
TOM
I hope thats just a phase hes going
through or its going to be a problem

BILLY
Tail wagging

BETTY
Farting idiot

Billy looks down at Walter - was picking this dog a mistake
Knowing his issue and sensing whats going on Walter fights
the building urge to fart again But it aint easy He
tries to hold back yet its a losing battle

He races for the doggie door bolts outside where

EXT COLEMAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

The family watches as Walter quickly digs a shallow hole
puts his butt in it and -- PFFFFT -- farts

The ground seems to swell Ants rush out of a nearby ant
hill Even a gopher pops out of a hole in the backyard and
staggers off

INT COLEMAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

As the family stares wide-eyed

TOM
Correction -- big problem

Thus begins our FART MONTAGE (Yes fart montage)
INT COLEMAN HOUSE -- DAY

the dinner she was making in the trash but only then

Spots Walter under the table Bending down to sniff near
Walter she instantly realizes the stench wasnt her food

INT PET STORE -- DAY

Billy loads up -- doggie bed giant doggie bone (which is
probably too big for Walter) new dog dish the works

of snacks he wants But ever the klutz he farts and knocks
over the entire display Billys look and shake of the head
says it all -- what did I get into with this dog

down The interior and Tom soaked to the bone

EXT PARK -- DAY

In a continuation of the park scene above Billy - tossing
the oversized bone and playing fetch with Walter - spots
Greg Swan (along with his Rottweiler Brutus) and his posse
buying ice cream from a vendor

Getting an idea on how to work his way into the group Billy
tosses the bone near the vending cart for Walter to fetch
And as Walter bolts after it

INT BILLYS ROOM -- MORNING

Walter snoozes at the foot of Billys bed in his doggie bed
whena giant spider lowers itself toward him on a web from
above That is until Walter farts in his sleep

The curtains move as the spider sways hanging on for dear
lifebefore rising back up to its web as fast as it can

EXT PARK -- DAY

Walter races toward the bone Billy threw in the park scene
above Picking it up he fartsmelting the just-purchased
ice cream cones of Greg Swan and his posse

After covering his nose when Greg looks up to see who did
it Billy hides behind a nearby tree And with all the dogs
in the park Greg is unable to figure out the culprit

EXT BACKYARD -- DAY

Arlene readies her camera to take a picture of Walter and
the kids when Walter farts knocking over the yard gnome and
breaking its nose FLASH

Tom races around getting ready for something as Arlene
furiously rearranges the room as she cleans

TOM

I think its more than a phase

TOM

was when he blew the napkins off the
table last night

Arlene points outside where Billy and Betty rake leaves
But each time they get them in a pile try as he might not
to Walter farts and blows them all over the yard again

Getting fed up Billy puts the rake down and points Walters
behind at leaves on the back patio PFFFT His fart clears
them off instantly

TOM (CONTD)
Billy dont use the dog as a leaf
blower

BILLY
Sorry dad

TOM

He closes the window

ARLENE

How the smell doesnt bother them

ARLENE
Yes I can barely breathe around

(lowering the window)
Well theyre simply ecstatic

EXT COLEMAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Billy and Betty trudge around the house to find UNCLE IRV
mid 50s that crazy whirlwind of a relative all kids dread
The one who still attempts to twist off his thumb way past
the age when theyve figured it out

UNCLE IRV
There they are

He rushes over grabs Bettys nose and steals it

UNCLE IRV (CONTD)
(thumb in his fingers)
Look what I got

BETTY

UNCLE IRV
(laughs)
You stinker

Uncle Irv turns his attention to Billy and starts rubbing
his knuckles across Billys head messing up his hair as

BILLY
Ow-ow-ow

EXT BACKYARD -- MOMENTS LATER

Uncle Irv follows Tom around the backyard as Tom gets ready
for the party Walter sits nearby in the shade

UNCLE IRV
So pulling in the big cash-ola with

TOM

Just then Irv - not Walter - leans over and lets one rip

TOM (CONTD)
Walter

Realizing the dog just got blamed for his fart Uncle Irv
smiles at Walterwho gets up and moves away from him

UNCLE IRV
You know if youd like to invest a
little extra of your doe-ray-me I
might have an excellent opportunity
for you and my niece to get in on
the ground floor of these self-storage
timeshares Im selling--

TOM
Self-storgetimeshares

Uncle Irv grimaces He obviously has to fart again sohe
walks over near Walter as he talks

UNCLE IRV
Exactly As I was saying

PFFFFFT Uncle Irv lets it rip again

TOM
WALTER Im warning you

Uncle Irv smiles

But Walters pissed He farts enough that he doesnt need
to be getting blamed for other peoples farts He gives
Uncle Irv a little growl then heads back near one of the
tables set up for the party

UNCLE IRV
You know how sometimes you dont
have enough space

Uncle Irvs face says it all - here comes another one He
walks near Walterwho scurries away But explaining his
get rich quick plan the whole way Uncle Irv follows

So Walter trots back across the backyardand so does Irv
Until finally Irv has him corned

PFFFFFFT Uncle Irv saves his biggest fart for last

TOM
WALTER Im telling you for the
last time - stay away from Uncle Irv
before he craps all over you

As Arlene comes out of the house carrying a bunch of food

-Roy I think youve met my neighbor
Alan Alan my boss Roy Huggins

ROY HUGGINS a balding bear of a man in his 60s nods and
shakes hands with the Colemans neighbor ALAN MANDELL DDS

A FEW FEET AWAY hearing the words my boss Uncle Irv
makes a beeline for Tom and Roy but luckily Arlenes nearby
to steer him away

ARLENE
Uncle Irv I want you to meet some
of my new neighbors

Disaster averted Seeing what his wife just did Tom mouths
thank you to her Arlene winks at him Youre welcome

BACK NEAR TOM he keeps conversation flowing

TOM

TOM
After the break-in on his street
Alan went right to the pound and got
a dog

MR HUGGINS

UNCLE IRV

-And now that you live closer I

Bettys eyes go wide as Uncle Irv grabs Bettys cheek in
that way kids hate Attempting to avoid it Billy grabs a
scrap of food off his plate and looks under the table for

BILLY
Walter

But hes not there

AT TOMS TABLE
Tom Alan and Roy are engrossed in conversation

MR HUGGINS
(between bites)
S0 if youre looking to replace
the imaging equipment at all five
dental offices youre a partner in
I can personally talk to the head of
our healthcare division

Alan smilesas does Tom So far so good Mr Huggins
digs into his food again But hes one of those people
who when they eat if it hits his mouth fine if not so
what because theres always another bite coming

Follow a morsel of food as it drops
UNDER THE TABLE where Walter happily eats it up In fact
hes getting about as much to eat as Mr Huggins But his
stomach is starting to churn As Walters eyes begin to
water trying all his might to hold back
BACK ABOVE Toms boss continues talking to Alan
MR HUGGINS (CONTD)
(still chowing away)
And I think I can smell a deal I
smell

PFFFFT A fart rips out Mr Huggins coughs as does everyone
else around the table Bad

Of course Tom starts looking behind him to instantly blame

TOM
Irv

But from way across the yard

UNCLE IRV
Yeah

With a dawning realization Tom turns back and pulls up the
table cloth to spot Walter

PFFFFFT Who farts again Big time

Mr Huggins clutches his throat pointing at it choking on
his food

Suddenly Mr Huggins topples over his feet hitting the
table sending a bowl of corn rocketing toward

THUNKAlan who gets hit in the head and stumbles backwards
into one of the support poles holding up the outdoor tent

And as the pole waversthen breaks free theres a giant
scream just as the whole tent collapses over the party

EXT CITY STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER
AN AMBULANCE races through the city toward the Coleman house

Looks like a hurricane just blew through The tent is on
the ground Folks have food all over them Arlene holds an
icepack to the lump Alans head Suddenly

A stretcher holding Mr Huggins an oxygen mask over his
face pops up into frame bracketed by two other PARAMEDICS

TOM
Is he going to be ok

PARAMEDIC
He should be fine

PARAMEDIC 2
Whoever performed the Heimlich on
him probably saved his life

Behind them

UNCLE IRV
Awww it was nothing Used to sell
family first aid kits door-to-door

The Paramedics begin wheeling the stretcher toward the
ambulance Tom following along

TOM
Im so sorry Roy As soon as you
get out of the hospital maybe you
can finish telling Alan about that
deal you were smelling His
concussion isnt that serious

But the angry look on Mr Huggins face tells Tom that wont
be his first conversation And as they load Mr Huggins in
the ambulance Tom jumping in beside him

INT COLEMAN HOUSE -- LATER

room because he choked on his food
and knocked out a potential client
due to a farting doq

Now take thatstinking dogto

THUNGGGGGGG Sticks in the opposite wall °

A guy waiting in the lobby holds up his paper staring through
a just-made hole in the story he was reading

And as the receptionist gets up from her desk
INT VET EXAMINATION ROOM -- LATER

peer down at the kids

PROF COMPRESSOR
Who sent you

BILLY
Uh Dr Reading For my dog

BETTY

The peephole slides shut Then

SHHHHWUNK Another peephole at dog level slides open as
the eyes now study Walter

PROF COMPRESSOR
Is this the canine in question

Betty nods as Professor Compressor eyes Walter

PROF COMPRESSOR (CONTD)
Hmmm Mmm hmmm

Billy and Betty exchange looks as

PFFFT Walter farts The eyes go wide Disappear for a
second then are replaced with what look like dark welding
goggles

Its a fart term Medically speaking
Type consistency odiferousness

BETTY

revealing PROFESSOR COMPRESSOR a white-haired eccentric in
his late 50s sporting a lab coat Eyes them Deciding
whether to help Finally

PROF COMPRESSOR
Let me see what I can do Come along
come along

INT PROF COMPRESSORS OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Professor Compressor leads the kids through his laboratory
which is adorned with fart charts telling how much humans
and other animals fart a History of Farting poster and
other fart related items

PROF COMPRESSOR
Flatus or flatulence more commonly
farts from the Old English word
feortan are produced by intestinal
gas formed by the air we breath
chemical reactions inside our insides
gas oozing into our innards from our
blood and bacteria living in our
entrails
44

BILLY
Thats disgusting

PROF COMPRESSOR
No no no Dont fear the fart
Did you know Emperor Claudius once
passed a law legalizing farting at
banquets for health reasons

BILLY
No

PROF COMPRESSOR
Of course you didnt Or you would
be the doctor and I would be the
you Do you see

They approach a special rear-end contraption with various
hoses fans and vents chugging away mounted to Walters
back side

BETTY
Whats this

PROF COMPRESSOR
The logical first question Its my
gastro-intestinal-spectra-reverse-
flatchio-gramometer-thingamadoodle

BILLY
A what

PROF COMPRESSOR
Its a fart machine Or rather an
un-fart machine A defartifier

Behind them Walter farts PFFFFT

PROF COMPRESSOR (CONTD)
Ooooh

A whistle on the machine sounds A bulge in the tubing lets
us follow the fart down and around until it reaches the guts
of the machine where a spinner starts going off lights begin
to flash until finally

Something is expelled into an expanding balloon Bigger
and bigger and BIGGER

The kids plug their ears waiting for the pop thats sure to
come but suddenly the balloon deflates and the process
reverses - the lights flash the spinner goes off - before
the fart races back down the tubing toward Walter where

THWUNG Walter blows up like the balloon
PROF COMPRESSOR (CONTD)
Voila

BILLY
What just happened

PROF COMPRESSOR
I captured Walters fartsent it
through my gastro-intestinal-spectra
uh fla-gram um meter uh

BETTY
The fart machine

PROF COMPRESSOR
Precisely Then at sub-sonic speed
minus the sub-sonic part I re-
attached the fart to the fartee

Billy and Betty stare at him

PROF COMPRESSOR (CONTD)
I put it back in the dog

They stare at Walter who looks like hes going to burst

BETTY
And thatworks

PROF COMPRESSOR
Smell anything

BILLY
No but--

PROF COMPRESSOR
No butts Exactly
(snaps his fingers)
That will be my company slogan
(to Billy)
Ever thought about a career in
marketing

BILLY
No but--

PROF COMPRESSOR

I like it A man with passion about
his ideas

(waves his hand)
Please Im already sold And when
I make the portable model for humans
Ill give you a cut of the profits
to be determined by me some nameless
attorneys and--

Walter farts A huge fart The tube instantly expands -
along with Prof Compressors eyes - as the fart races for
the machine and - boom - fries the machine blowing the
whistle clean off as it does

PROF COMPRESSOR (CONTD)
Plan D Better skip right past B
and C

CUT TO
Walter standing on an examining table under a bluish light

PROF COMPRESSOR (0S) (CONTD)
Now a human produces almost a half
liter of flatus gas each day resulting
in fart index of 14 Your our dog
has an index of 86

BETTY (0S)
What does that mean

PROF COMPRESSOR (0S)
He farts a lot

Suddenly as if on cue Walter farts PFFFFFT But this
time we can actually see it Like a small cloud coming out
of him and rising up in the room

BILLYBETTY
Wow

Reveal Billy Betty and Prof Compressor all wear the welding-
type goggles the good doctor had on earlier

PROF COMPRESSOR
Theyre my specially designed gastro-
intestinal-spectra-flatchio-specs

BETTY
Fart goggles

PROF COMPRESSOR
Im impressed by your scientific
continuity

Betty smiles

PROF COMPRESSOR (CONTD)
Using these goggles you can see the
size scope and shape - and even
sometimes the chemical contents - of
Walters farts

BETTY
Contents Ewwwww

PROF COMPRESSOR
Hey I didnt invent farting I just
study it

BILLY
So what good do these do us

PROF COMPRESSOR
Questions without answers Until I
speak Very sly indeed
(then)
What was the question

Billy holds up the goggles

PROF COMPRESSOR (CONTD)
Oh right By experimenting with
the changes in diet I have
prescribed

He whips out a looooong piece of paper

PROF COMPRESSOR (CONTD)
-Youll be able to figure out which
foods make him fart the least Then
mix and match until voila presto

(snaps his fingers)
No more farting

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD -- LATER

Billy shrugs as he puts the fart goggles on

BETTY (CONTD)

FART GOGGLE POV - Billy scans the area Glances over at

THE BUS STOP where a bunch of folks wait to get on As the
bus pulls up and people enter and exit clouds fill the

As the kids try all these different potions With
increasingly crazier and crazier foods spices and beverages

After making each one Betty slides the bowl in front of an
increasingly reluctant Walter as Billy puts on the goggles
and waits But after each timeWalter farts However

The farts seem to be getting smaller until finally Walter
eats andnothing No farts

Suddenly Greg Swan looks up and spots Billy

GREG
What do you want fraternal freak

At first Billy doesnt say anything Greg approaches

GREG (CONTD)
Well

Again no answer

GREG (CONTD)
Maybe your dog can speak for you

The others laugh Finally

BILLY

This is

(trying to make it

sound scary)
Walter I rescued him from the dog
pound

(then for effect)
Where he was just about to be killed

Now Billy has their attention Even Gregs head perks up

BILLY (CONTD)
He was on death row

GREGS FRIEND
Why were they gonna kill him

BILLY
Because he was the meanest most
vicious dog theyd ever seen at the
pound

Greg looks at Walter This dog Mean

Billy tugs on Walters leash Show them Walter growlsthen
chokes on something Gags Almost pukesthen growls again

BILLY (CONTD)
(taps his head)
Crazy mean

Billy seems to be connecting with them But as Greg sizes
up Walter and Billy Betty wanders into the park wearingthe
fart goggles Billy is horrified

BETTY
Billy Billy

She approaches

BETTY (CONTD)
Youre not going to believe what I
saw with these You gotta check out
that couple over there

FART GOGGLE POV - where a guy and a girl are on a date The
girl looks pained Each time the guy turns around a small
cloud pops up behind her

BETTY (CONTD)
-Every time the guy--

GREG
Aint it a little early for ski
season

BETTY

Theyre not ski goggles theyre
fart goggles

GREG
Fart goggles

Uh oh Bettys getting nervous Billy shoots her a look
Please dont But she cant help it She starts talking

BETTY
Farts are produced by intestinal gas
formed by the air we breath chemical
reactions in our intestines gas
seeping from our bloodstream into
our intestines and bacteria living
in our intestines And these goggles--

Billys dying Shes gonna ruin everything So
BILLY
What are you talking about fraternal

freak

Greg and his friends laugh Bettys stunned

BETTY
Billy--

BILLY

Go on Scram And take your farting
ski goggles with you

Bettys crushed She turns and heads for the fence For
home Billy turns back to Greg

BILLY (CONTD)
Sisters What a pain

Beat

GREG
Wanna light some firecrackers with
us
The moment hes been waiting for Billy nods and heads toward
them But Walter digs in his heels Billy looks back to see
why Walters staring at Betty whos trudging off all alone
Billys momentarily torn Then

BILLY
Cmon Walter

MOMENTS LATER
POP POP POPPOP

Greg lights off a string of little firecrackers which to 10
and 11 year old boys is pure magic

Lighting another match Greg gets ready to set off another
string of Black Cats on the ground Bending down

GREG
(to Billy)
You want to try some
Billy nods Acceptance is here

GREG (CONTD)
Ok Next batch you can--

He doesnt even finish the sentence because
PFFFFFFFT Walter lets out a massive fart one that had
been building since the kids thought they cured him And
its directed right at Greg and the lit match

WHOOOOSH Hitting the flame a giant fireball shoots out at
Greg Swan And on his scream

INT POLICE STATION HALLWAY -- LATER 7

Billy and Walter wait as behind a closed door

ARLENE (0S)

POLICE OFFICER (0S)
The paramedics assured me his eyebrows
would grow back

Billys eyes go wide

ARLENE (0S)

Arlene walks out of the office Shes not happy

ARLENE (CONTD)
Lets go Now

BILLY
But mom we were just playing and--

ARLENE
Playing with firecrackers And see
what happened Its always fung
until somebody loses an eyebrow
You can explain it to your father
when he gets home

And on that most dreaded of motherly threats

INT BILLYS ROOM -- LATER

Billy eyes the clock like a prisoner on death row when the
sound of a car pulling in the driveway grabs his attention

As Walter covers his face with his paws
INT FOYER -- CONTINUOUS
Arlene enters to see a dejected Tom come in the door

ARLENE
Whats wrong

TOM
My boss is sending me out of town on
thisstupid assignment in Indiana

costing the company Alans account
So now I have to fly to the plant in
Indiana on Friday Then--

ARLENE

TOM

INT BILLYS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Billy tries to listen to his folks conversation When he
cant hear he goes over to the laundry chute and sticks his
head inside to see if that helps Walter just watches when

TOM (0S)

Hearing Walters name Arlene loses it

ARLENE

They all stare at her June Cleaver gone mad Finally

TOM
What yourobviously stressed out
mother is trying to say is I have
to go out of town for work for a few
days and your moms going to visit
Aunt Kaye And while were gone her
Uncle Irv is going to stay with you

In the doorway Bettys eyes go wide Not moms Uncle Irv
TOM (CONTD)
But when we get back wellI think
we should take Walter back

BETTY
Dad

TOM
Im sorry But he has to go

Tom and Arlene exit the kitchen

BILLY
Maybe you were right

BETTY
About what

BILLY
Maybe we shouldve gotten a cat
instead of a dumb dog after all
Hes been nothing but a disaster
since we got him

Hearing something the kids glance outside to seeWalter
head down trudging away from the window He heard it all

Betty just shakes her head at her brotherbefore leaving
him all alone in the kitchen

FADE TO BLACK

He hugs her before they climb into their respective rides to
the airport As the cab doors shut

INT BILLYS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

-Billys eyes flutter open Getting out of bed he glances
around the room Looks down at the doggie bed empty

INT HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

Billy trudges toward the bathroom stopping first at

INT BETTYS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Not the typical little girls room Instead of stuffed
animals and posters of boy bands this room is decorated

with the periodic table a poster of Albert Einstein and the
only toy - a Lego replica of the Capitol Building

Billy peers in But no sign of Walter Hmm Thats strange

INT KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

Billy enters the kitchen and notices Walters untouched food
dish when

UNCLE IRV (0S)
There he is

Before Billy can even defend himself Uncle Irv is messing
up his hair and rubbing his skull with his knuckles

UNCLE IRV (CONTD)
Whos your favorite relative

He keeps grinding his knuckles on Billys noggin Messing
up his hair even more Answering like a POW whod do anything
to stop the torture

BILLY
You are Uncle Irv

UNCLE IRV
Atta boy

Uncle Irv finishes off his morning hello with a pinch to
the cheek As Billy rubs his face

BILLY
Have you seen Walter

UNCLE IRV
(like a Mexican
gunfighter)
No senor I have not seen El Stinko

And as Uncle Irv pulls his finger guns out of two invisible
holsters and shoots Billy

INT BASEMENT -- MOMENTS LATER
Billy stands at the bottom of the steps and

BILLY
Walter

Nothing
EXT BACKYARD -- MOMENTS LATER

Starting to get worried Billy exits the house searching
for the dog

BILLY
Walter Cmere boy

But Walter doesnt come running

Noticing something at the rear of the backyard Billy rushes
over to discover

A SMALL HOLE dug under the fence
INT HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

Betty trudges toward the bathroom when Billy comes racing up
the steps Out of breath and totally frazzled

BILLY
Walter ran away

EXT HIGHWAY -- SAME TIME

Cars whiz past in both directions And there near the side
of the road is

WALTER who trudges along head down something clutched in
his jaw Moving closer reveal hes carrying the picture of
the kids and himself And as he continues on his way

EXT ANIMAL SHELTER -- LATER

Billy Betty nearby pleads with seemingly nobody in front
of Karls destroyed-but-under-repair animal control truck

BILLY
-And when I got up this morning
he was gone He dug under the fence

Suddenly Karl rolls out from under the Critter Catcher
Furrows his brow very understanding

KARL
Oh no your little doggie ran away

Billy nods

KARL (CONTD)
Well dont you two worry about it
Ill make sure we get him back Ok

Billy nods and Karl gives them the biggest its-gonna-be-ok
look imaginable Behind him Larry has approached and nods
in sympathetic agreement

Billy shuffles off and disappears with Betty around the
corner Karl looks at his battered truck then turns to Larry
and smiles

KARL (CONTD)
Payback time

SMASH CUT TO
Karl addressing the other dog catchers

KARL (CONTD)
All right listen up people Our
fugitive has been on the run for
Ninety minutes Average paw speed
over uneven ground barring injuries
scratching himself and chasing his
tail is four miles per hour That
gives us a radius of six miles

(MORE)

KARL (CONTD)
What I want from each and every one
of you is a hard-target search of
every gas station residence
warehouse farmhouse henhouse
outhouse and doghouse in that area
(then)

Especially doghouses For obvious
reasons

(beat)
Your fugitives name is Walter the
farting dog Go get him
And on their roar
EXT STREET CORNER -- LATER

Walter picture still in his mouth stands in an alley doorway
near the corner unsure where to go As people pass but
not knowing where the smell is coming from

WOMAN
Ewwwwgh

MAN
Whats that smell

Hearing them Walter slinks off into the shadows
EXT CITY DUMP -- LATER

Piles and piles of smelly waste A couple stray cats in the
distance Moving past the mounds of trash find

Walter whos finally found a place where nobody will notice
his smell Flies buzz all around him That is until

PFFFFT Walter farts and the flies drop right out of the
sky

Walter lowers his head Ashamed and feeling lower than ever

Suddenly the sound of scratching catches his attention
Walter glances around but doesnt see anything Yet

Thhhhh Thhhhh Thhhhh The scratching sound continues

Walter trots toward a pile of debris where he thinks its
coming from

THHHHH THHHHH THHHHH
The sound getting louder indicates hes right He starts

sniffing the ground near a large piece of pipe He glances
in the pipe to see

TWO EYES staring back at him

Walter jumps back startledand crashes into some cans
Picking himself up he slowly approaches the pipe again

Peers inside to see a pair of eyes just as scared as he is

THHHHH THHHHH THHHHH The trapped animal claws away
Help

Getting an idea Walter goes around to the back of the pipe
to see

A small piece of the animals tail sticking out Walter
sets down the picture of the kids and himself thats hes
carrying then barks as if to warn the animal inside what
hes about to do

THHHHH THHHHH THHHHH comes the reply Got it

Walter latches onto a bit of tail and yanks Nothing He
yanks again Still nothing Finally he gives it one last
mighty tug and

POP Walter goes tumbling backwards as does the animal he
just freed

A SKUNK
EXT ALLEYWAY -- LATER
A couple of stray dogs dig through a trash can when

Karls banged up animal control truck appears at the end of
the alley

The dogs look up

INT CRITTER CATCHER -- SAME TIME

Karl eyes his prey through his still-cracked windshield In
the passenger seat next to him Larry buckles his seatbelt
Tight

EXT ALLEYWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Like old gunfighters Karl and the dogs stare at each other
from opposite ends of the long alleyway

The dogs emit a low growl Karl guns the engine

Each waits for the other to make the first move as a newspaper
blows across the alley like a modern-day tumble weed

Suddenlythe dogs dart off in different directions

INT CRITTER CATCHER -- CONTINUOUS

Karl smiles

KARL
Its go time

As he stomps down on the accelerator
EXT ALLEYWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Smoke pours out where tires meet pavement searching for
traction until finally

Screeeeeeeech

The truck lurches forward and shoots down the alleyway
The chase is on

EXT CITY DUMP -- SAME TIME

Walter begins walking away Behind him the skunk starts
making skunk noises as if to thank Walter

Walter nods picks up the picture of the kids and keeps
walking

The skunk runs after him following alongside Walter on a
piece of pipe Trying to hang out with his new buddy

Walter doesnt stop but the skunk wont give up He continues
along on the pipe chattering away Eek-eek-eek-e--

Before the skunk can even finish

PFFFFFT Walter farts staggering the skunk who tumbles
over falling off the pipe

Walter stops and stares at the skunk Hangs his head - I
did it again To a skunk even

The skunk pulls himself up Starts chattering away again as
if to say Im ok Im ok

EXT SUBURBAN STREET -- SAME TIME

Billy wearing the fart goggles and Betty cruise up the
streets on their bikes as

BILLY
Here Walter

BETTY
Cmere boy

Suddenly via the goggle POV Billy spots a giant fart cloud
come over a nearby fence

BILLY
Walter

Billy races over and peeks over the fence to seehis
teacher Ms Schembri the cloud still all around her

MS SCHEMBRI
Hello Billy What are you doing
here

EXT CRITTER CATCHER -- LATER

Larry watches the master at work Karl addressing a couple
of just-captured dogs and a cat caged in the back of his
truck Among them are the dogs from the alleyway

KARL

(shakes his head)

Well not on my streets Un uh

Mister Cuddles didnt they send

He eyes each of the animals like a warden staring down his
prisoners Having sufficiently established whos boss

KARL (CONTD)

But today today just might be
somebodys lucky day Because I
need a little information

(then)
Im looking for a dog

(shows Walters picture)
This dog Thisfarting machine of
a dog Anybody seen him

Nothing but blank stares He moves the picture in front of
each of them

KARL (CONTD)
You sure Nobody

More blank stares from the animals

KARL (CONTD)

That how its gonna be Because
things can happen in my custody
For instance just because you have
a tag they have a way of

(he reaches in and

yanks the tag off

one of the dogs)
-Falling off Then since I cant
contact anybody well Im not always
able to make a happy reunification
between owner and pet if you know
what I mean

He pauses letting his words sink in Then
KARL (CONTD)
So who wants to go home and who
wants to go to the pound Huh
Its a very simple choice Just
need a little information

The cat starts to pace in its cage Sensing blood in the
water

KARL (CONTD)

What about you Mister Cuddles You

wanna go home or you wanna go to the

pound
Beat
The cat meows
And as Karl smiles
EXT CITY DUMP -- LATER
As Walter and the skunk sit atop a trash pile looking out
over the city below the skunk nudges him - Whats that
picture in your mouth

Walter sets it down and shows him

The skunk looks at the picture at Walter Starts making
noises I get it Soooooco sorry

Walter hangs his head Woof Thanks

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD -- SAME TIME

Riding past some homes in the neighborhood that arent as
well kept up the kids continue their search for Walter

BETTY
Well least we know whos been cutting
the cheese in class now

As they pass one house with crap all over the front yard and
an engine block hanging from the tree Suddenly

RAAAA RAAAAA RAAAAA A giant Rottweiler rushes at them
jaws flashing

Billy swerves and nearly falls off his bike as he jolts toa
stop And here comes that dog Right for Billy Its gonna

GREG

Billy doesnt answer Swallows hard

BETTY

GREG

Greg takes a step toward Billy who swallows hard when

GREGS MOTHER looks through the screen door

GREGS MOTHER

GREG

Just a minute mom Im talking to

GREGS MOTHER
Well why dont you invite them in

Billy grabs Bettys arm to quiet her and starts to ride off
Betty quickly pedals after him

BILLY

BETTY

And as Billy shakes his head and pedals on
EXT CITY DUMP -- SAME TIME
The animal control truck pulls into the dump

Like the Terminator cruising the streets for Sarah Connor

Karl behind his cheap sunglasses scans the area for his
prey while he drives

EXT CITY DUMP -- CONTINUOUS

The damaged Critter Catcher weaves its way through mounds of
trash But no sign of Walter

The truck heads toward the last pile of trash The one Walter
and his skunk friend were sitting atop

The truck pulls up to it buttheyre gone Walters no
longer at the dump

INT ANIMAL CONTROL TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS

Karl turns to the mesh wire separating him from the caged
animals in the back of the truck

KARL
(to the cat)
So much for going free today Mr

Meeeecooow

KARL (CONTD)
Oh meow-meow-meow Daddy dont pay

Just then the trucks radio crackles to life

DISPATCH (VO)
Unit 3 we got a 10-42 at the park
This is not a drill

And as Karl punches the gas
EXT PARK -- SAME TIME

A beautiful idyllic day at the park People ride bikes
Families have picnics A Latino family has a childrens

birthday party complete with pinata Lovers sit against
trees wooing each other

Suddenly a murmur races through the tranquil setting People
begin coughing and grabbing their noses Then eyes widen
and people start to scream as

The folks at the park begin fleeing like residents of Tokyo
in a Godzilla flick To heighten this effect

LATINO CHILD
(pointing off plugging
his nose)
Mofeta Mofeta

Subtitles Skunk Skunk

As everyone continues running off in different directions
even leaving the birthday boy still swinging away at the
pinata reveal

Walter (the picture safely tucked in his collar) and his new
skunk friend cutting through the park

Seeing what hes caused all around him Walter hangs his
head makes a sound as if to say Sorry

The skunk snorts in reply No big deal Heck hes so used
to it he decides to have a little fun with the situation

Suddenly the skunk stands on its hind legs and starts making
as much noise as his little body can muster As he does
add GODZILLA SFX Cross cut with people fleeing

Then just as quickly the skunk drops back down and starts
walking again His fun for the day over

Walter and the skunk head over to a deserted picnic and start
eating some of the food left behind After chowing down for
a moment Walter glances around Theres nothing to drink

Spotting a water fountain about 20 yards away Walter goes
to quench his thirst After he disappears suddenly

SHOW THE PARK BEING SCANNED THROUGH BINOCULARS It rakes
back and forth before - Aha - settling on

THE SKUNK centered in the cross hairs Reveal

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARK where Karl spies on the skunk
with binoculars as Larry keeps the other park visitors —
watching the unfolding drama at a safe distance behind him

LARRY
Never fear Karl isarrived

KARL
(snaps his fingers)
Snare pole
Whoosh Larry throws it to him
KARL (CONTD)
Watch and learn folks This is
what we train for
And as Karl heads toward the unsuspecting skunk

NEAR THE WATER FOUNTAIN Walter finishes getting a drink
when he looks up to see

Karl sneaking up on the skunk as he readies his snare pole

No time to lose Walter darts off

KARL starts extending the snare pole toward the still-eating
skunk

WALTER races for his friend

THE NOOSE of the snare pole is just large enough to fit around
the skunks head now only inches away

WALTER might not make it soWoofhe barks
The skunk looks up just as the snare pole closes down but
Walter leaps knocking the skunk out of the way as

WHOOOSH The snare pole clutches shut around Walters neck
Captured

Unsure what to do at first the skunk just stands there
But clearing that up quickly Walter barks Woof Run

And the skunk does right for the nearby tree line But
Karl doesnt even make an attempt to go after him because

KARL (CONTD)
Well well well We meet again

From the trees the skunk watches as Walter is dragged away
the picture of Billy and Betty falling out of his collar

INT ANIMAL SHELTER -- LATER

BETTY

Billy

BILLY

Not knowing what to say Billy looks out the window And as
he stares out at the full moon

INT ANIMAL SHELTER -- SAME TIME
Walter locked in a cage also looks out at the moon

FADE TO BLACK
EXT RUNDOWN PART OF TOWN -- MORNING

Billy and Betty plead with Professor Compressor who peers at
them through the peephole of his storefront office

BETTY
And weve looked everywhere

BILLY
(holds up fart goggles)
Even using these Still nothing

PROF COMPRESSOR
An obviously redundant revelation
Those are simply to study the farts
not find the farter To market them
as such would be quite contradictory
Theoretically speaking of course

BETTY
Can you help us find him

PROF COMPRESSOR
After I already informed you of his
unique faculty for flatulence only
to have said insight ignored Ergo
ie zidbit - why should I help you
this time

BILLY
(starting to tear up)
Please Idont want to lose him

PROF COMPRESSOR
(beat then)
Come along come along

And on the sound of door being unlocked
INT PROF COMPRESSORS OFFICE -- LATER

A device slightly larger than an iPod with a wire running
to a mic-sized sensor attached to it sits on a table as

PROF COMPRESSOR
Its my specially designed gastro-
intestinal-spectra-flatchio-meter

BETTY
A fart-o-meter

PROF COMPRESSOR
Oh no no no This time your stab at
probable pronounceability is mistaken
Its a far-tometer

BETTY
Isnt that the same thing

PROF COMPRESSOR
You say tomato I say far-tometer

EXT CITY STREETS -- LATER

VARIOUS SHOTS of the city as the kids ride through town
Passing their SCHOOL riding by the PARK everywhere Billy
sweeping each area with the fartometer as we hear

PROF COMPRESSOR (VO)
Using a fart sample from Walters
last visit this device will detect
minute traces of his flatulence in
the area while filtering out OPFs

BETTY (V0O)
OPFs

PROF COMPRESSOR (V0O)
Other Peoples Farts And best of
all no visual verification is vital
Ergo ie zidbit - you dont have to
be able to see the farts to find the
farter

Finally as they bike past

EXT ANIMAL SHELTER -- MOMENTS LATER

22222z--Z2222--ZZZZZ The fartometer squawks to life
INT ANIMAL SHELTER -- MOMENTS LATER

Billy and Betty talk to Karl who sits behind his desk picking

his teeth and reading the latest issue of DOG CATCHER MONTHLY
Larry nearby

BILLY
I just wondered if anybody turned
in my dog
KARL
Sorry Cant say I heard nothing
(to Larry)

You heard anything

Larry shakes his head Nope Havent heard anything Karl
shrugs Sorry

Billy and Betty turn to go when down the hall behind them
Woof Woof
The kids stop That bark sounds familiar

BILLY
Walter

Woof woof woof

BETTY
You sure nobody found our dog

Karl gets up from his desk Walks around and starts showing
the kids out

KARL
Positive But if we hear anything--

Then from somewhere down the hallPFFFFT A massive fart
sounds The other dogs start howling

The needle on the fartometer spikes 222222--ZZ22--2222

BILLY
Walter

Billy breaks free from Karl and runs down the hall toward
the animal cages

KARL
Hey you cant go back there

Too late
NEAR THE ANIMAL CAGES Billy races down the aisle as

BILLY
Walter

Woof Woof Woof

Billy races up to findWalter locked up in one of the cages
Seeing Billy the dog goes nuts

BILLY (CONTD)
Walter I knew wed find you Im
so sorry boy Im sooooo sorry

Billy sticks his hand inside the cage and Walter practically
licks the skin off as Karl and Betty rush up behind him

BETTY
Give us our dog back
KARL
Aint your dog ‘Cording to the

papers on file this here dog is
owned by a Mr Tom Coleman

BILLY
Thats our dad

KARL
Well I suggest you bring him down
here then

BETTY
But our parents are out of town until
next week

KARL
(exchanging looks
with Larry)
That so Well come talk to me when
mommy and daddy get back in
(then)
If its not too late

And on Karls laugh

Betty types in her query on the Google homepage - Breaking

She clicks on the Google Search button And after a brief

BETTY (CONTD)
I love the Internet

INT COLEMAN HOUSE -- LATER

Uncle Irv finishes locking up the house and turning the lights
off for the night

Heading up the stairs he opens Bettys door Seeing her
sound asleep he gently closes the door and checks on

Billy whos also zonked out Uncle Irv quietly shuts Billys
door SuddenlyBillys eyes pop open As he pulls off

the sheets revealing hes still dressed

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD -- SAME TIME

All is quiet in suburbia untilBetty and Billy backpack
slung over his shoulder sneak past some houses when

A dog barks off in the distance and the kids freeze But
realizing it has nothing to do with them they continue on

EXT ANIMAL SHELTER -- LATER
From across the street the kids case the animal shelter

Near the front door the only thing they see is a small animal
of some sort jumping around outside Billy points

BILLY
First time I ever saw an animal trying
to get in the animal shelter

Betty nods Takes another look around Except for the
critter outside the coast is clear

The kids sneak across the street As they get closer reveal
the animal outside the door is none other thanWalters
skunk friend

Since hes viewed the picture of the kids that Walter was
carrying upon seeing Billy and Betty the little skunk goes
nuts Jumping up and down

The skunk keeps trying to get their attention but the kids
dont acknowledge him

Finally the skunk turns and runs off toward the tree line

BETTY
Ok lets do it

Billy takes off his backpack and opens it pulling out

A screwdriver wire cutters a hammer pliers kite string
two Tupperware bowls and a bag of MandMs

BETTY (CONTD)
What are the MandMs for

Billy smilesand eats a handful

BILLY
Snack

BETTY
(shakes her head)
Ok let me take a look

Billy bends down and Betty climbs up on his shoulders He
moves her in front of a small window where

She peers inside and sees the hamster cages Karls office
and the animal cages but

BETTY (CONTD)
Oh not No no no

DOWN BELOW struggling not to drop his sister

BILLY
What

BETTY
They moved his cage

BILLY
Whose

BETTY

Walter Hes all the way in the
back now It wont work

She jumps down Grabs her diagrams and starts shaking them
BETTY (CONTD)
All the calculations were made for
his cage being where we saw it
She tears up the diagrams and slumps against the wall
Billy slides down the wall next to her
BETTY (CONTD)
He might not make it until mom and

dad get back

BILLY
Dont talk like that

They both fall silent whenthe skunk runs up something in
his mouth But the kids just ignore him until he walks over
and sets down the thing in his mouth right in front of them

The kids eyes go wide
BETTY

on his shoulder Hands pressed against the wall for balance
Billy slowly makes his way over to the left

Billy nods Barely
BETTY (CONTD)
(to the skunk)

She lifts the skunk above her head and places him inside the
AIR DUCT

And as Betty jumps down both she and her brother stare up
at the opening above Hoping

INT AIR DUCT -- SAME TIME

The skunk scurries down the chute pulling the hose along
with him

INT ANIMAL SHELTER -- SAME TIME

Caged animals look up as the sound of the skunk overhead
echoes from the air duct Among those looking up is

WALTER
But the skunk scurries right past him
INT AIR DUCT -- CONTINUOUS

The skunk keeps on his mission until he reaches an opening
above

THE HAMSTER CAGES

The skunk then begins lowering the hose down toward them
When its right outside their cage the skunk stops and
scampers back down the air duct

INT ANIMAL SHELTER -- MOMENTS LATER

Hearing something above his cage Walter looks up to see the
skunks eyes staring back at him

Woof

Walters tail starts wagging as

The skunk lowers himself to within inches of Walters cage
ala Tom Cruise in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE He then slides the
other end of the hose inside toward his pal

Next the skunk slips the bandanna off his neck and opens it
up revealing its filled with

Rice Krispy Treats

The skunk takes one and holds it out over Walters cage before
letting go

-Where the contents fall into Walters cage As the skunk
rises back up the hose Walter just stares at the food dropped
into his cage until

THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS the kids scream something at him
from outside Walter tilts his head What

EXT ANIMAL SHELTER -- SAME TIME
The kids yell away
BILLYBETTY
Eat Eat the treats Remember
Rice Krispies root beer and garlic
They make you fart
And as they start miming away

INT ANIMAL SHELTER -- SAME TIME

Walter watches the kids mime stuffing food in their mouths
then act out farting Massive farting Into the hose

Ahhhh now Walter gets it He begins chowing away on the
treats And chowing And chowing Until moments later

PFFFFFT He farts
INT AIR DUCT -- CONTINUOUS

The skunk watches as a giant fart bubble races up the hose
past him and toward

INT HAMSTER CAGES -- CONTINUOUS

Where the hamsters sleep Peacefully That is until

PFFFFFT

A giant fart bursts out of the hose waking them instantly
The little critters cough and rub their eyes But before
they can even get their bearings

PFFFFT

Another fart explodes from the hose The hamsters are wide
awake now

As a third fart blasts through their cage attempting to get
away from the god-awful smell the hamsters all start running
like hell on their little hamster wheels creating a wind
current which begins blowing papers on Karls desk before

Knocking over the almost-empty Coke can which

Rolls off and knocks over a broom which

Tips over and smacks into an iPod which tumbles off the shelf
continuing the Rube Goldberg-esque sequence which ultimately

causes the coat stand to tumble into the key ring hanging on
a hook which

Whoooosh Ends up shooting the keys out into the hall where
The skunk retrieves them and
EXTINT ANIMAL SHELTER -- MOMENTS LATER

-Slips out of the building dropping them at the feet of
the kids

Billy immediately gets to work testing the keys in the lock
No no no n-- click Bingo

The kids slip inside and head for

Woof Woof Woof

Next to the kids the skunk goes nuts as well

Eeee eeee eeeek

The kids quickly free Walter and head for the doors the
other caged animals going crazy all around them including
Mr Cuddles and some of the others weve seen before

The kids stop Glance around at these animals Exchange

Walter looks up at the kids Back at the skunk Realizing
what Walters asking

EXT PARK -- MOMENTS LATER

The kids and their saved dog cut through the park on the way

BETTY

BILLY
He can stay in the woods behind the
house I think--

GREG (0S)
I think somebodys gonna get it

The kids look up to see Greg Swan his dog Brutus and Gregs
minions hanging out in the park

And as for Greg he looks totally silly now with two huge
eyebrows where his normal ones used to be Put it this way
Michael Dukakais eyebrows werent this pronounced

Greg looks at Billy Betty Walter and the skunk

GREG (CONTD)
Would you look at this Stink
stankstunk and their friend the

His minions laugh but Billy is transfixed staring at Gregs
enormous new eyebrows

GREG (CONTD)
What are you looking at

BILLY
N-n-nothing

GREG
(points at his eyebrows)
You think its funny Having to get
an eyebrow transplant

Greg spins around revealing two missing strips of hair near
his neckline Spinning back

GREG (CONTD)

Brutus watch this dog And if he
moves bite him And if he farts
bite him harder

GRRRRRRRRRRFFFF With pleasure

Gregs posse circles around

GREG (CONTD)

Greg pushes him Billy doesnt respond

GREG (CONTD)
Thats what I thought Too much of
a sissy to defend yourself

Greg pushes him again Biilys shoulder goes flying back
from the impact But still no response

GREG (CONTD)
Cmon Ill even give you the first
punch

Greg puts up his fists for a fight but nothing comes his
way Greg starts laughing as do his friends

GREG (CONTD)
Maybe his sister hits harder

BETTY
Leave him alone

GREG
Shut up freak

Greg pushes Betty backwards sending her to the ground
Greg and his crew laugh

On the ground Betty catches glances with her brother And
something inside him snaps Billys fist clenches shut

BILLY
Dont you ever touch my sister

GREG
Why What are you--

Greg starts to turn backand Billy swings All the anger
and emotion inside of him packed into this one punch

CRACK Dropping Greg Swan like a deer David has just felled

Goliath
Billy stares at his fist Did I do that

Gregs friends mouths agape look on in awe as Billy stands
over their fallen leader untilBilly offers his hand to
Greg who still rubbing his jaw ignores it before dragging
himself off the ground

An uneasy beat of silence as everyone simply stands there
not knowing what to do next This is unfamiliar territory
for everybody involved

Attempting to regain the upper hand for his side Brutus
growls Trying to be menacing But its too late The
tide has turned Walter just farts in his face causing

YIGHYIGHYIGH Brutus to whimper and begin digging a hole
toward China in an attempt to flee the smell

Finally Greg simply bolts off Brutus next to him as the
posse disperses into the night

Billy looks back down at his magic hand Like hed never
seen fingers before

BETTY
Howd you do that

Billy slowly shakes his head I have no idea
EXT COLEMAN HOUSE -- LATER

his bone lying in it

ON THE STAIRCASE

BURGLAR 1 (CONTD)
You shouldve come down

AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

Walter rushes out of Billys bedroom -- clutching his doggie
bed in his mouth -- as Billy and Betty hook Arlenes
resistance tubing to the banister on one side a doorknob on
the other

Setting down the doggie bed Walter grabs his huge ol bone
out of it and rushes over to Billy Billy places it in the
tubing Walter bites down and starts pulling back on his
bone stretching the tubing back Tighter Further

ON THE STAIRCASE

The two Burglars creep up when spotting something at the
top

Walter lets go of the taut workout band sending his bone
rocketing right for Burglar 1s groin

And as Burglar 1 clutches himself and tumbles back down the
stairs past his cohort

BILLYBETTY
Yeeee haaaaaaaaaa

Burglar 2 turns around just in time to see the kids and

Walter hop in his doggie bed like members of the Olympic
bobsled team

Using the banister the kids and Walter launch off the landing
down the stairs and

WOOF WOOF --CRASH

Pick up the spare nailing Burglar 2 and sending him
falling backward where he lands with a thud atop his still-
groggy partner

The kids hustle out of the doggie bed and over to their Uncle
Irv They quickly pull the tape off his mouth

UNCLE IRV
Good job

And begin to untie him when
Woof Walter barks A warning

The kids whip around just in time to see the Burglars charging
at them

Billy ducks under the clutches of Burglar 2 and scampers
between his legs

Burglar 2 spins around to see Billy on the other side of an
end table holding a lamp in his hands

Before the Burglar can even think Billy tosses the lamp in
the air towards him as

BILLY
Catch

Instinctively Burglar 2 reaches out to seize the lamp
Allowing Billy to ram the end table across the floor and
THWACK Directly into Burglar 2s shin

BURGLAR 2
OWWWWWWWWWWWWW

Which causes him to instantly reach for his now-throbbing
leg Bad move because

THUNK The lamp crashes down on the toe of his formerly
good foot

And as Burglar 2 lets out another yelp Billy races away
but is stopped in his tracks by

WOOF Walter trying to alert him to something
Billy reels around to see

Burglar 1 closing in on his sister whos trapped in the
corner

No time to lose Billy quickly glances around Eyes the
chandelier in the center of the room Spots Walters leash
Bingo Walter races over and grabs it Sprints to Billy

Moving quickly Billy runs up the stairs and throws out the
“hand loop of the leash lassoing a hook on the chandelier

IN THE CORNER OF THE LIVING ROOM
Burglar 1 closes in on Betty
BURGLAR 1

He laughs a hearty burglar laugh and closes in on her when

WHOOSH

Billy flies in from above swinging on the leash hanging
from the chandelier

In one fell swoop he snatches his sister just as Burglar 1
reaches for her and continues right on past like a real-
life Spiderman dropping out of the sky to save Mary Jane

They swing on to the dining room where Billy lets go dropping
them safely to the ground

IN THE LIVING ROOM Burglar 1 helps Burglar 2 to his feet

BURGLAR 2
Maybe we should just go rob another
house You know one thats easier
With maybe like just an alarm system
or armed guards

The Burglars tip toe out in the hallway and round a corner
when

Walter leaps out of the darkness

of her concern the two burglars staggering off

his reach and begins to howl at the top of his lungs

Suddenly from every corner of the street dogs and cats
begin to appear First a few Then more And more One
