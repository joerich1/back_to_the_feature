EXT CHLODNA STREET - DAY

A stream of cars and trams Jewish policemen and German

soldiers much in evidence

Szpilman and Henryk join a large crowd of Jews waiting
at

a barrier to cross the intersection The crowd is
agitated

impatient for a policeman to stop the traffic and let
them

through

A MAN next to Szpilman and Henryk is becoming more and
more distraught shifting his weight from foot to foot
taking off and putting on his hat

THE NERVOUS MAN
This is totally insane why do we
have to have a gentile street
running through our area Cant

Meanwhile a street band begins to play a waltz Jewish
policemen and German soldiers are clearing a space

Jews out of the way including Szpilman Henryk and the
nervous man Other soldiers are clearing a space

Two GERMAN SOLDIERS pull out of the crowd a tall woman
a short man and haul them into the cleared space

THE GERMAN SOLDIER
Dance

The couple dance to the street bands waltz

At intervals German soldiers select even more unlikely
couples a fat woman with a painfully thin man a young
boy with an elderly woman two men and two cripples
The German soldiers are to various degrees amused

of them is almost hysterical with laughter

SOLDIERS
Faster Go on faster Dance

The couples dance as fast as they can A soldier kicks

The friend watches the customer intently as he drops
coins one by one onto the marble He drops them puts
ear close and listens Two or three he discards but

smiles when coins make a pure tone and he keeps them

boy is jammed in the hole

From the other side of the wall the sound of an angry
German voice and of a boot stamping violently on the

Szpilman continues to try to pull the boy through

The sound of the German voice swearing and the dull
crunching noise made by the boot smashing into the boy
continues and with every thud the boy screams in

pain

Szpilman struggles to help the boy whose screams are
becoming weaker yet increasingly desperate

Szpilman pulls his arms and finally manages to get him
through The boy lies moaning

EXT UMSCHLAGPLATZ - DAY

Szpilman Mother Regina and Father with others enter
through one of the gates which closes on them They

for a moment to take in their new surroundings
The Szpilmans and their POV

Their first sight of the large rectangle walled on two
sides and overlooked by buildings Several hundred

People walk up and down

SZPILMAN
Lets sit over there

But he stops again and so do the others Something
see causes them to stand stock still expressionless

THE SZPILMANS POV
An unoccupied space at the edge of the compound where
bloated decaying bodies lie near to a wall The wall

itself

is spattered with blood Large flies walk over the
dead

Nobody goes near

THE SZPILMANS

Szpilman turns away and leads the others to another
space

Later

Glaring sun The Szpilmans have settled down on the
kerb

of a pavement and are waiting Szpilman stands
observing

the scene

Mother sits on a bundle of things staring vacantly
her

hair hanging down in strands Regina beside her has
her

hands over her face and is weeping the tears running

through her fingers

Father walks nervously up and down hands behind his
back

four steps one way four steps back Near them a YOUNG

WOMAN begins to wail

THE YOUNG WOMAN
Why did I do it Why did I do it

A young man beside her whispers to her but she does
not

seem to take in what hes saying Her cries continue at

intervals

THE YOUNG WOMAN
Why did I do it Why did I do it

More Jews are being unloaded from trucks and are
marched

through the gates Mothers children old people
begging

most of them holding papers Pandemonium

The sun high blazing Szpilman is wandering around
occasionally greeting people The place is crowded now
packed Trucks bring more and more Jews at intervals

Old people lying down exhausted impossible to tell
some of them are alive or dead Women carrying

children drag themselves from group to group One WOMAN
approaches Szpilman

WOMAN WITH CHILD
Hes dying dont you have a drop

Szpilman shakes his head sadly The woman with child
off to another group

A MANS VOICE

Szpilman turns to see a man DR EHRLICH haranguing

FATHER
I can hear you

Szpilman goes to them

DR EHRLICH
(overlapping)
Were letting them take us to our
death like sheep to the slaughter

FATHER
Dr Ehrlich not so loud

DR EHRLICH
Why dont we attack them Theres
half a million of us we could
break out of the ghetto At least
we could die honourably not as a
stain on the face of history

Another man Grun joins in

GRUN
Why you so sure theyre sending us
to our death

DR EHRLICH
Im not sure You know why Im not
sure Because they didnt tell me
But Im telling you they plan to
wipe us all out

FATHER
Dr Ehrlich what do you want me

sadly
SZPILMAN
(shakes his head
almost to himself
a forlorn smile)
Stupid stupid
THE YOUNG WOMAN
Why did I do it Why did I do it
Szpilman stands and stares at her
Later
The sun lower but the heat still intense
The place is now packed to suffocation People calling
out
names trying to find each other The wailing of women
and

the cries of children

A cordon of Jewish policemen and SS guards are almost
surreptitiously ringing the compound

The Szpilmans sit in the same place with Henryk
sitting a
little apart and now reading a small book

THE YOUNG WOMAN
Why did I do it Why did I do it

HALINA
Shes getting on my nerves What
did she do for Gods sake

Grun leans across to her
GRUN

(quietly to Halina)
She smothered her baby
Halina looks at him in disbelief

GRUN
Theyd prepared a hiding place and
so of course they went there
But the baby cried just as the
police came She smothered the
cries with her hands The baby
died A policeman heard the death
rattle He found where they were
hiding

Later
Szpilman and Henryk

SZPILMAN
What are you reading

HENRYK

(a crooked ironic

smile)
If you prick us do we not bleed
If you tickle us do we not laugh
If you poison us do we not die
And if you wrong us shall we not
revenge

Szpilman takes the book and reads the title page
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

SZPILMAN
Very appropriate

HENRYK
(taking the book
back and resuming
his reading)
Yes thats why I brought it

Later

The Szpilmans seated on the kerb Their attention is
caught

by a BOY who has a box of sweets on a string round his

neck And hes setting the sweets pocketing money

HENRYK
Idiot Whats he think hes going
to do with the money
Father calls to the Sweet Boy and beckons him over

FATHER
How much for a caramel

THE SWEET BOY
Twenty zlotys

FATHER
What For one caramel What dyou
think youre going to do with the
money

THE SWEET BOY
Twenty zlotys

FATHER
(turning to the
family)
Have we got twenty between us

They search their pockets and handbags hand over to

Father

what change they can find He in turn hands the money
to

the Sweet Boy who hands over one caramel and goes on
his

way

Father holds the caramel between thumb and forefinger
and

examines it carefully Then carefully takes out his

penknife and with great care divides the caramel into
six

pans He hands a part to each of the family

They all exchange a look an acknowledgement of each
other

almost like a toast and then they chew slowly

deliberately

The whistle of a locomotive Sound of trucks rattling
over

the rails

At once a sound of great agitation from the Jews in
the

compound
