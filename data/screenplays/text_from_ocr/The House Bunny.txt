The iconic Playboy Mansion in all its glory Peacocks and
flamingos wander amongst topiaries celebrating the female
form Two hummingbirds feed off the ‘nipples’ of a pair of
topiary breasts

EXT MANSION POOL - DAY 2

A lagoon-like oasis where BEAUTIFUL BLONDES frolic and splash
as admiring men watch We follow a shirtless BUTLER carrying
a tray of cocktails He passes ADAM LEVINE from Maroon 5 who
sits on the diving board playing an acoustic version of THIS
LOVE entertaining the ladies

ADAM LEVINE
(singing)
T have no choice ‘cause I wont
say goodbye any more --

A nearby girl wearing an oversize T-shirt hears the song
She drifts toward the music as if in a trance stripping off
her shirt to reveal her tiny bikini SCOTT CAAN does a
running cannon-ball into the pool splashing the girls

GIRLS
(whiny )
Scott Youre getting us wet

SCOTT CAAN
Hey Dad did you see how big that
splash was

JAMES CAAN is lounging by the pool surrounded by young girls

JAMES CAAN

Yeah Scott that’s just great
(back to girls)

Anyway then Francis Ford Coppola
says ‘Jimmy you should direct The
Godfather After all you wrote
it’ And I said ‘No Francis why
don’t you do it’ It felt good to
give the kid a break

The girls all react impressed Then we see HUGH HEFNER
being interviewed

INTERVIEWER
So Hef as far as women go do you
have a ‘type’
HEF
A type No I wouldn’t say I have
a ‘type’

Widen to REVEAL Hef is surrounded by his three NEARLY
IDENTICAL BUXOM BLONDES

HEF (CONTD)
As long as a woman is beautiful on
the inside that’s what counts

adorably wide-eyed Sweet and bubbly she radiates optimism
and good cheer

Shelley Darlington she’s lived
here at the mansion for almost ten
years She’s one of my favorites

Shelley smiles but at one end of the line of Hef’s girls a
bunny glares at Shelley obviously jealous of her
relationship with Hef This is CASSANDRA 20s a hot Bunny
with an ego as big as her boobs

SHELLEY
You’re so sweet to me Hef but all
the girls here are great

HEF
And you’re like their Mama Bear
taking care of them all
Hef’s girls all smile Cassandra just rolls her eyes in
disgust
EXT MANSION - POOL - MOMENTS LATER 3
Shelley is treading water when suddenly Scott Caan swims up
SCOTT CAAN

When are you gonna let me steal you
away from this place Shelley
SHELLEY
Dont be silly Why would anyone
ever leave the mansion

SCOTT CAAN
Good point Hey Levine how about
a chicken fight

ADAM LEVINE

Caan

Adam Levine ditches his guitar and dives in Scott Caan
dives under and surfaces under Shelley and lifts her up on
his shoulders

SHELLEY
Oh my gosh I love riding
bareback

Adam Levine comes up under

CASSANDRA
(to Shelley a little too
intense)
Youre goin down

SCOTT CAAN
Take her Shelley

SHELLEY
I don’t want to chicken fight I’m
a vegetarian

SCOTT CAAN
It’s not fighting it’s just fun

Cassandra grabs Shelley’s head roughly and shoves her back
Shelley topples with a splash She bobs back up drenched and
disoriented

SHELLEY
Did we win

their drinks

SHELLEY
(deeply touched)
They’re two years old on Friday

Cassandra comes walking over

CASSANDRA
Shelley why are you keeping all the
rich good looking guys to yourself
I think you should introduce me

SHELLEY
Of course This is Cassandra she’s
only been here a few months but
everybody loves her because she is
super beautiful and she never
throws up on anyone when she’s
drunk

The men all nod in admiration Cassandra looks disgusted
POTBELLY

So tell us Shelley how does a
girl become a Bunny
SHELLEY
Well when I was a senior in high
school my guidance counselor said
he knew the perfect job for me So
he took a picture of me in my
bikini and sent it to the magazine
The next thing I knew I was in LA
shaking hands with Hugh Hefner And
he told me I didnt have to live in
a foster home anymore I could live
here and have a whole new family
So here I am

COMBOVER
Are you a centerfold

CASSANDRA
(catty)
She wishes

SHELLEY

Yeah I do so cross your fingers
hopefully Hef might give me good
news at my birthday party this
weekend

(sotto excited)
I have my turn-ons ready and
everything

POTBELLY
And what might those be

SHELLEY
Tanning giving backrubs
convertibles and rude people
(beat then)
No wait rude people is a turn-
off I’m such a yummy dummy

CASSANDRA
True that

SHELLEY
Being a centerfold is the highest
most prestigious honor there is
It says “I’m naked in the middle of
the magazine unfold me”

POTBELLY
I suppose its kinda like the Nobel
“piece of ass” Prize
They laugh hysterically Shelley looks confused Potbelly
puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze

POTBELLY (CONTD)
(continuing)
Well darlin seems like youve
got a pretty good life here

Shelley beams dreamily

SHELLEY
Its paradise --

Pooter starts freaking out The harder he tries to put her in
the car the more she digs her claws into his bare chest

his chest

steels her resolve and marches down the street

EXT ZETA HOUSE - DAY 34

Shelley checks her makeup in a compact mirror makes sure she
has nothing in her teeth and walks up to the door and knocks
As she knocks the Z in ZTA falls off and smashes on her
head knocking her to the ground The door opens and we see
Maria 21 smart-girl type with a phone in her hand She
sees Shelley laying on the porch and rushes to her side

MARIA
Oh my G-D Are you okay

Shelley lifts her head looking a little more dazed than
usual

SHELLEY

every time we open the door

She tosses the pieces of the Z into a bush
SHELLEY
(looking up)
At least you still have T and A

Shelley offers a high five Maria stares at her

MARIA

Shelley pops up off the ground practically exploding with
enthusiasm

SHELLEY
My name is Shelley and Im here to
be your housemother

MARIA
Well it’s nice to meet you Shelley
but its too late

SHELLEY
Oh no Did you hire someone else

MARIA
(helping Shelley up)
No It’s just that we may lose our
charter and if we don’t have a
house we wont be needing a
housemother

SHELLEY
Why are they going to take your
house away

MARIA
Well because we don’t get enough
pledges and everyone thinks we’re
losers

SHELLEY
That’s so sad Why does everyone
else get pledges

MARIA
Uh they have great parties and
they’re popular and boys want to
date them

Shelley perks up

walkway She stops and looks at the guys hanging around Phi
Mu and the other sororities

SHELLEY (CONTD)
So they want to be popular and have

INT ZETA HOUSE - DAY 35

Maria shuts the door and turns around to find Mona 21 a
heavily pierced feminist with a shaved head She is reading a
piece of paper and wearing a T-shirt that says “legalize
castration”

MONA
So if we dont get thirty pledges
we lose our charter

MARIA
Which also means goodbye zeta

HARMONY 21 a make-up free hippy chick in a poncho
overhears

HARMONY
But I planned on having a drum
circle in the backyard for the
Summer Solstice

MARIA
I need to worry about getting
thirty pledges right now Harmony
Not the three stoners who might
show up for your bongo party

MONA
Thirty pledges But theres only
fourteen of us

HARMONY
Fourteen and a half

Harmony points at BECKY an eight-months PREGNANT GIRL

BECKY
Actually fourteen and three
quarters as of last week

MARIA
They know were never going to get
that many pledges Its just their
way of shutting us down

JOANNE 21 wearing a large scoliosis brace walks up upset

JOANNE
You guys this is so awful

MARIA
I know
(noticing)
Youve got some refrigerator
magnets on your brace again

Maria pulls the magnets off Joanne’s brace

JOANNE
Oh my G-d

Joanne is looking out the front window

JOANNE (CONTD)
There are boys on the lawn Our
lawn

On the front lawn several boys have drifted over to see
Shelley who is doing YOGA IN HER BIKINI We see even more

The GIRLS of Zeta -- a motley crew of 14 various misfits--
sit on ratty couches staring at Shelley as she greets
everyone with unbridled enthusiasm

SHELLEY
Oh my gosh you guys Im so happy
you want me here You won’t be
sorry Hey -- let’s have a pillow
fight

Shelley grabs a pillow and hits Tanya ( A 21 year old little
person) who rolls hard from the pillow blow into a wall
Shelley gives a whoopsie look MONA is appalled

MONA
This is how were going to get
pledges By hiring an archaically
superficial reflection of the male
fantasy

Shelley smiles and waves pleased by this compliment

MARIA
Exactly -- Guys like her Mona And
if you havent noticed guys dont

like us
TANYA getting up off the floor points to the pregnant girl

TANYA
Apparently some guy liked Becky

The girls all laugh Becky does a goofy dirty dancing move

HARMONY
So in order to be a sisterhood
now we have to be popular

MARIA
No In order to keep our house we
have to be popular Maybe Shelley
can teach us how

The girls start talking among themselves Shelley raises her
hand

SHELLEY
Okay look -- let’s put a pin in
the pillow fight for now And
don’t get me wrong I love boys
But I lived in a house full of
girls for nine years and I know
there is nothing more fun than
being with your sisters sharing
talking all night body painting
and baking penis cookies

The girls stare at her CARRIE MAE 21 a heavy big toothed
farm girl in jeans and a sleeveless T-shirt takes the
toothpick out of her mouth

CARRIE MAE
Where in tarnation did you live

SHELLEY

ear

MARIA
No that doesn’t make her a hooker
Lilly

Lilly turns bright red and runs out of the room

INT SHELLEYS ZETA ROOM - DAY 38

Maria leads a bewildered Shelley into a small room behind the
kitchen

MARIA
Okay this is your room Heres the
key

Shelley sets her bags down on the bed and holds the key over
her heart

SHELLEY

Carrie Mae enters with a tool box

CARRIE MAE

Off of Shelley’s look

CUT TO

INT BATHROOM - DAY 39

Shelley walks out of a stall with the plunger stuck to her
bare midriff There is an expression of bewilderment on her
face She looks to Harmony for help

SHELLEY
Are there instructions for this
thing

Harmony rolls her eyes grabs hold of the plunger and starts
pulling It finally breaks free sending her sprawling
Shelley looks at the round mark on her stomach

SHELLEY (CONTD)
Hey that thing ate my belly ring

INT KITCHEN - LATER 40

Shelley is opening and closing the lid of the garbage can
Mona walks in and stares at her in disbelief Shelley turns
to her

SHELLEY
This isn’t broken

MONA
(pointing to the sink)
The garbage disposal Bunny

Shelley walks over to the sink and looks in it She looks to
Mona

SHELLEY
What’s the matter with it

MONA
I don’t know look and see

As Shelley looks in the hole Mona flips the switch and a
stream of ground up garbage shoots out covering Shelley’s
face Shelley pulls a completely mangled spoon out of her
mouth

SHELLEY
I found the problem

MONA
You are so vapid

SHELLEY
You’re like the hundredth person
who’s told me that Thank you

41 INT ZETA HALLWAY - LATER 41

We see a TOPLESS Shelley from behind walking out of the
bathroom freshly showered Towel around her head and towel
around her waist As she walks down the hall we see the
Zeta’s diving back in their rooms in shock and embarrassment
Lilly the shy English girl actually faints Maria rounds the
corner reading a letter

SHELLEY
Afternoon Maria

Maria looks up and reels back at Shelleys toplessness

MARIA
Shelly Wheres your robe

SHELLEY
Oh I just like to air dry

MARIA
I don’t think half the girls here
have seen their own bodies naked
they certainly want to see your
perfectly engineered boobs

Maria takes off her jacket and puts it over her
SHELLEY
I’m just walking around in the body

g-d and Dr Silver gave me

MARIA
Come with me We have work to do

42 INT MARIAS ROOM - DAY 42

Shelley now dressed sits down on Marias bed all business
Maria holds up the letter

MARIA
We have twenty-eight days before
national headquarters shows up with
a For Sale sign

SHELLEY
You need 30 pledges How many did
you get last year

MARIA
One But she got transgender
surgery and moved to the boys
dorm Technically Bob is still a
Zeta but she’s not allowed to live
here with a weiner

She points to the Zeta composite picture where we see BOB in
the bottom corner -- a hulking angry-looking extremely
masculine girl

SHELLEY
Well this year were going to get
lots and lots of pledges The kind
that dont want testicles Their
own I mean

Shelly laughs really hard at this cute joke Maria waves the
letter she was reading

MARIA
We also need to raise money for our
philanthropy Were the only
chapter that didnt meet the fund-
raising requirement

SHELLEY
Whats a philacanopee

MARIA
Philanthropy Its like a charity

SHELLEY
I love doing charity One time at
the mansion I even let Gary Coleman
grind on me during a slow dance

MARIA
Look rush starts in three weeks
Heres some ideas I came up with
that might make us popular

She hands Shelley a list

SHELLEY

(reading)
Host a CSI night Start a bee-

keeping club Have a Googlefest

Shelley tries to be excited but is in fact quite worried

SHELLEY
Oh wow -- these are super super
good ideas But we might want to do
something a little more -- sexy
CUT TO
43 EXT ZETA FRONT YARD - DAY 43
All fourteen Zetas stand outside in baggy T-shirts and
sweatpants -- staring in absolute horror
HARMONY
Is she serious
MONA
I am so offended right now
The object of their scorn is -- Shelley standing next to a

sign that says “Zeta Car Wash” in skimpy bikini bottoms and a
tank top hose in hand sexily sudsing up her own car

SHELLEY
Cmon girls washing cars is a fun
and sexy way to raise money

She undulates with the hose as the girls look on horrified
Maria implores them
MARIA

Just give it a chance --

JOANNE
(re her brace)
I cant bend that way Plus if my
brace gets wet it could rust

The girls laugh So does Joanne

MARIA

See We’re already having fun

Shelley waves to some passing BOYS

SHELLEY
Hi boys

One of them is COLBY 21 smokin hot Maria eyes him with
terrified lust

MARIA
(sotto)
Oh my G-d Thats Colby I love
him What do I do

SHELLEY
Do sexy

As the boys near Shelley milks it even more putting on an
act for their benefit

SHELLEY (CONTD)
(continuing)
Wash those cars you sexy bitches

MONA
Did she just call us bitches

TONYA
Did she just call us sexy

A few of the girls are trying halfheartedly to get involved
Becky has waddled over to the bucket but can’t bend over her
pregnant belly to get a sponge out Carrie Mae keeps spitting
her chewing tobacco on the car window and scrubs aggressively
at a birdshit stain It is not having the effect that
Shelley wanted so she turns the hose on herself dousing her
chest with water

SHELLEY
Uh oh look -- wet T-shirt

The guys get psyched Maria picks up a hose and tries to
emulate her

MARIA
And wet pants

Maria squirts herself in the crotch but alas she does not
look sexy She looks like shes peed herself

SHELLEY
Oopsie Someone went accident in
her sexy pants

Colby averts his gaze and turns back to Shelley

COLBY
Yeah Anyway were having some
drinks over at Theta Chi later
Wanna come over

SHELLEY
Well we are a little thirsty

She drinks suggestively from the hose then holds it out to
Colby

SHELLEY (CONTD)
(continuing)
Wanna sip

COLBY
Sure

He bends closer to take a sip as -- NEARBY Mona cranks up
the faucet so Colby is BLASTED in the face with water He
jumps back now soaked as Mona cracks up Maria rushes
toward him with a towel

MARIA
Are you okay

He takes the towel and gives Mona a dirty look Mona hits
back with a ‘bring it on look’ Shelley tries to save the
day

SHELLEY
So what time should we come over
for drinks

COLBY
Now that I think about it the
guest list is pretty full Maybe
next time

The guys walk off as Maria watches in despair

MONA
(to the Zetas)
I think were done here “sexy
bitches”

They all go back in the house
MARIA

(to Shelley)
I better go talk to them --

She follows dejected Shelley is left alone Then she’s
sees a good looking guy stapling a flier to a telephone pole
It’s OLIVER 30’s shy and cute As he walks over to his car
Shelley calls out to him

SHELLEY
Hi Do you need a car wash

Oliver looks around to confirm Shelley is talking to him

OLIVER
Me Oh uh no I gotta get back to
work

SHELLEY

Oh I’m at work right now

OLIVER
You wash cars

SHELLEY
No I’m the Zeta sorority
Housemother

Oliver approaches Shelley

OLIVER
Really You seem too young to be a
Housemother

SHELLEY
(excited)
Really You think I’m young

OLIVER
Yeah

SHELLEY
How sweet What’s your job

OLIVER
I manage a nursing home

SHELLEY
Oh it’s so great you give nurses a
place to live

OLIVER
Actually it’s a home for senior
citizens You know old people

SHELLEY
I know lots of old men Hairy and
not hairy

OLIVER
Well I have to get going

Oliver hands her one of the fliers he was putting up

OLIVER (CONTD)
If you ever want to stop by the
nursing home we always need
volunteers to help out and visit
with the seniors

SHELLEY
(looks at flier)
Thanks I’m Shelley I like long
walks and I hate rude people

OLIVER
(laughing)
Cool I’m Oliver

They shake hands warmly then Oliver goes to his car and
drives off Shelley looks at his flier her face lights up
as she gets an idea

INT ZETA LIVING ROOM - DAY 44

Maria is in the midst of an argument with the other girls
Shelley enters from the yard still in her bikini

SHELLEY
(continuing)
You guys I just had the best idea
for our philanthropy Were going
to volunteer at Oliver’s nursing
home

MARIA
Who’s Oliver

SHELLEY
They guy I just met

MARIA
You see Shelley knows how to meet
guys and if guys are hanging out
with us more girls will want to
hence more pledges
A moment

then

HARMONY
Volunteering at a nursing home
seems like a nice thing to do

The girls murmur in agreement except

She MEOWS

MONA
Those places smell funny Like
boiled chicken and pee

MARIA
Too bad we’re doing it

SHELLEY
That’s so great lLet’s get all
dressed up and go to a nightclub
and have fruity drinks and dirty
dance with each other

CARRIE MAE
For what

SHELLEY
We need to bond We’re sisters At
the Mansion we bonded all the time
and everyone loved us and we had
lots of friends And once a
psychic came over and told me that

my cat Pooter and I were cousins in

a past life which totally makes
sense because I can do this --

The girls stare at her

JOANNE
Why did you tell us that

SHELLEY
I dont know I just like that
story

MARIA
I think what Shelley is trying to
say is that we should go out and
have some fun Pledges like fun

BECKY

JOANNE

TONYA
(trying to do shelly)
Meow

BECKY
It is five dollar pitcher night at
the Think Tank

Shelley puts her arm around Becky

SHELLEY

HARMONY
I’ve been boycotting that place but
I can’t remember why so I guess we
could go

Mona rolls her eyes and holds up a textbook

MONA
I have more important things to do

MARIA
I think it’s the perfect place for
you to find a thesis topic for your
gender relations class

MONA
(thinks for a beat)
Okay But that’s the only reason
I’m going

CARRIE MAE
(reading a text from her
phone)
Lilly says to have fun but she has
to stay and clean the closet

A closet door opens a crack and a hand waves goodbye

INT COLLEGE DIVE BAR - NIGHT 45

Hot drunken college kids eye each other trying to figure out
who theyre going to shag Bad KARAOKE is going on in the
corner as some frat guys sing Guns n Roses The Zetas look a
bit uncomfortable A bartender pours them a round of kamikaze
shots Shelley takes one and holds hers up

SHELLEY
To Zeta Heres to making you the

They all do a shot( Becky goes to but Maria grabs it from
her) Shelley spots a guy staring at Monas facial hardware
in horrified fascination

SHELLEY (CONTD)
(continuing)
Mona that guys checking you out
Flirt with him

Mona looks over and sidles up to the guy nervously

MONA
Hi

Mona bites him as he screams and runs away Shelley points
out another guy to Carrie Mae

SHELLEY

Carrie Mae checks him out then walks over leaning back on
the bar in what she thinks is a seductive pose

CARRIE MAE

The guy bolts Repulsed Carrie Mae calls out to him

CARRIE MAE (CONTD)

crowd as LIKE A VIRGIN starts They squint at the lyrics
as they flash by on the SCREEN and start singing -- a little
awkward at first

ZETAS
(singing)

proud

is pointing out where they should set up The older folks
look excited

OLIVER

A DJ plays MUSIC A disco ball now hangs from the ceiling
The old folks shuffle around the lobby salsa dancing as best
they can in their slippers led by a short DANCE INSTRUCTOR
The Zetas fill in as dance partners where needed

DANCE INSTRUCTOR

secretly check each other out The music switches to a waltz
Francis yells over to Oliver

FRANCIS

dance

SHELLEY

OLIVER
Are you sure Because I have no
problem letting Francis think Ima
gay

She holds out her hands in a waltz position He takes her in
his arms a bit awkwardly They start waltzing

Oliver and Shelley look into each others eyes Then he
proceeds to step on her foot

SHELLEY

OLIVER
Sorry about that

SHELLEY
( cheerful)
Its all good

He doesn’t want to step on her foot again so he looks down at
his feet As he does this he keeps mouthing “side one
two side one two” Maynard and Beatrice dance next to
them

MONA
(appalled)
What were you an indentured
servant

SHELLEY

(confused)
No these are my real teeth
Besides Oliver isn’t like any guys
I know He’s sweet and kind of shy
A lot of guys at the Mansion would
just say what’s the delio and ask
if they could show me something
purple in the orgy room

There is an awkward silence as the girls digest this bit of
info

TANYA
Speaking of orgies how’s Colby
doing

MARIA

Awesome I think Shelley tricked
him into liking me We hung out
three times this week

SHELLEY
Did you do it with him yet

She suggestively moves her eyebrows up and down

MARIA
No G-d -- I dont do -- that
SHELLEY
(excited)

Youre a virgin That’s so cute We
have to have an Aztec party We
always wanted to have one at the
mansion but we could never find a
virgin to sacrifice

Off the girls puzzled looks

SHELLEY (CONTD)
And it will get us our thirty
pledges

A QUICK SERIES of mail popping into various computer screens
in dorm rooms the library computer labs etc

A female student opens the mail it’s the Evite from the
Zetas She clicks ‘play’ and on the COMPUTER SCREEN we see
the ZETA WEBSITE We see graphics announcing the Aztec
Party with little dancing cartoon girls each with a real
Zeta girl head on it with Shelley prominently dancing in the
center A banner scrolls across the top saying “come see a
real virgin get sacrificed” A cartoon Maria is carried on to
the screen by some cartoon Aztecs They hold her up while
another cartoon cuts her head off The head falls to the
ground and says “See ya Friday” and The video ends and we

She poses first with her butt shoved out and then with her
boobs shoved out

GUY
Uh the second one

She makes a note

MONA
And because you like my boobs
would you stand there and let me
giggle like an idiot for five
minutes just in the hope that we
might hook up

GUY
Uh Yes

She makes another note
MONA
And just out of curiosity even if
you didn’t find me attractive
would you find it offensive if I
did this
She grabs his nipples

GUY
Uh no

With pudding

Tanya passes by thrown over the shoulder of one of the
loincloth guys She calls out to Shelley and Maria

The native slaps Tanya on the ass as they pass and moans in
goofy delight

CROWD
Lava Lava

As the crowd chants The loin-clothed guy carries Tanya up the
ladder As people go crazy Mona notices Ashley and Courtney
approaching

MONA
Hello ladies Can I help you

fellow sisters the Zetas were
doing

The crowd erupts in cheers as Tonya gets thrown high in the
air for a bellyflop sacrifice The crowd goes ‘ooh’

COURTNEY
Pretty big splash for a cabbage
patch doll

Courtney laughs and holds up her hand for a hi-five Mona
stares at her for a beat and then reaches over and grabs the
microphone that Maria had earlier She turns it on

MONA
(over the speakers)
Who wants another sacrifice

The crowd goes crazy

MONA (CONTD)
It doesn’t sound like you really
want it

The crowd goes crazier

MONA (CONTD)
Are these two good enough

She points to Ashley and Courtney who stand there
dumbfounded The crowd goes insane A group of guys rushes
over picks up the two squealing Phi-Mus and starts heading
towards the volcano

MONA (CONTD)
(yelling into the mic)
WAIT A MINUTE

The entire crowd stops and looks at Mona Dead silent

MONA (CONTD)
We can only sacrifice virgins Now
I’m not sure about these two so I
think we should take a vote Does
anyone here think either of these
two girls is a virgin

The entire crowd yells “No Way” in unison

MONA (CONTD)

wife’s underarms

Shelley thinks she has been rambling so she changes the
subject

SHELLEY (CONTD)
But I don’t want to bore you with
all that girly stuff So let’s talk
about something else

She smiles Oliver is not what you would call a player so he
is a little awkward around Shelley’s none too hidden
sexuality

OLIVER
Um Okay Who are you gonna vote
for

SHELLEY
I’m not sure yet I just know I
won’t listen to what Simon says
he’s so mean I usually agree with
Paula and Randy

MONA

OLIVER
Well -- I guess it works because

Oh my g-d Hef that is so
awesome I can’t believe it

HEF
Believe it And I want you to move

Shelleys smile is gigantic but she notices things around the
kitchen that remind her of her new family a Zeta calendar on
the wall pictures from the Aztec party and the nursing home
with Oliver in front are on the fridge Hef keeps talking
but we don’t hear what he is saying anymore Shelley is
having second thoughts

and that’s when I overheard the
girls talking about me I thought
they’d be better off without me
so here I am

MARVIN
I don’t know Shelley it sounds
like they were better off with you

SHELLEY
I guess not And you know what
really sucks is for the first time
in my life I really felt like
people liked me for what I had to
say I was even going to sign up
for some night classes next
semester so I could come up with
even smarter things to say to
people but I guess that would be
stupid now

This hits Marvin

SHELLEY (CONTD)
Anyway good night Marvin It’s
great to talk to you again

MARVIN
It sure is Shelly Good night

Marvin goes to exit pausing at the door for a moment to look
at Shelley rolling over sadly to go to sleep Then he exits

philanthropy Since then we’ve
added kick ass parties to the list

Joanne is talking to some girls by the front steps

JOANNE
There really isn’t a Zeta type
We’re open to all girls who are
looking for something different

Now we had a deal And it appears
that you have not fulfilled it So
Monday Zeta will appear in front of
the Pan-Hellenic council to have
their charter revoked If you have
any evidence of your charges
against Ashley you can present it
there

The Zetas look devastated as they head back to their house
The Phi-Mus wave goodbye and fake like they are wiping away
tears as they head back inside

INT PLAYBOY MANSION - LIBRARY 124

Shelley is getting ready to shoot her centerfold She has
chosen the library as her setting She is posing next to one
of the bookshelves with a cart full of books She is not yet
nude but she is very skimpily dressed There is a person with
a fog machine and a person with a wind machine Everyone is
bustling around Shelley looks distracted

PHOTOGRAPHER
We need more fog

The guy cranks up the machine a little and a cloud of smoke
envelopes Shelley

SHELLEY
(coughing)
Why would there be fog ina
library

PHOTOGRAPHER
It’s sexy Who knows maybe someone
is smoking

Maria enters

MARIA
Or maybe it’s because your butt is
smoking hot

SHELLEY
(excited for the first
time)
Maria What are you doing here

They run to each other and hug While Maria and Shelley are
talking various hair make-up people and clothing stylists
work on Shelley like a Nascar pit crew Going as far as
flossing her teeth

MARIA
I came to straighten out the mix up
about what you overheard the girls
saying about you

SHELLEY
How do you know about that
MARIA
Well let’s just say a little bird

told me

Maria looks to the door Marvin is standing there smiling
Maria looks back to Shelley

SHELLEY
What bird

Maria and Marvin react Marvin walks over and stands right
next to Maria

MARIA
Shelley Marvin called me and said
you told him everything that
happened It was alla
misunderstanding so I came right
over

SHELLEY
But I heard what you guys said
about Everyone thinks I ruined
Zeta Mona said I turned you all
into a bunch of dumb bunnies OUCH

One of the pit crew has plucked an unwanted hair from
Shelley’s butt with a pair of tweezers and holds it up
proudly

SHELLEY (CONTD)
Could I have five minutes guys

Everyone walks away as Shelley puts on a robe and leads Maria
to a different room

CUT TO

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 125

The girls enter the room which is adorned with old photos on
the wall

MARIA
Mona was just talking about our
hair and the way we were dressing
Maybe we did go a little to far
But everybody loves you For the
next ten minutes we all talked
about how you were the best thing
that ever happened to us The
house just isn’t the same without
you

Shelley’s eyes well up a bit at this news

SHELLEY
Really

MARIA
Of course You’re the best
housemother any sorority has ever
seen

They hug

SHELLEY
Oh my G-d I have to thank Marvin
And where’s that big bird I’d like
to thank it too

MARIA
Shelley forget about the -- I will
pass on your thanks to the bird

SHELLEY
(breaking the hug)
So what happened with rush

MARIA
Well we had tons of girls
interested but no one showed up
because Ashley stole our bids We
have no proof but she did

SHELLEY
So the house is gone

MARIA
Yeah We’re supposed to go in front
of the Pan-Hellenic council on
Monday to make it official but I
don’t think any of us are even
going to show up We been
humiliated enough in our lives

Shelley looks at the old PHOTOS on the wall of Hef and his
exploits throughout the years She stops in front of the one
she was staring at before and pulls it off the wall

SHELLEY
Maybe someone else does

INT PAN-HELLENIC COUNCIL MEETING 126

A large auditorium style classroom It is filled with
sorority and fraternity types There is a table at the front
with Ashley and a couple of other “Greek” leaders There is
also a large screen and a projection system Mrs Hagstrom
and Mr Walker her fraternity counterpart are obviously
running things

MR WALKER
So the new goal for fund-raising
next semester is two thousand
dollars per house

(MORE)
MR WALKER (CONTD)

Anyone coming in above that will be

honored in our yearly banquet All
those in favor say aye

EVERYONE
Aye

On the big screen the group shot from the Zeta’s appears

MRS HAGSTROM
Now our last order of business
Unfortunately not all of us will
be here next year

Shelley and all the girls enter at the back of the

auditorium

MRS HAGSTROM (CONTD)
For the fifth year in a row the
Zeta’s did not fulfill their rush
requirements so they will be de-
certified and their house put up
for sale All those in favor

Shelley makes her way down the center aisle
bubs

SHELLEY
Not so fast I have one piece of
business that I think everyone will
want to see before you get to your
piece

MRS HAGSTROM

Please Miss Darlington you are not
a housemother anymore You don’t
even have a house This fine
institution of higher learning will
be much better off without a band
of misfits led by a wanna be porn
star This institution is and
always will be hose bag free

SHELLEY
I couldn’t have said it better
myself

Everyone hub-

The crowdhuh what Carrie Mae gets the guy running the
projector in a headlock and Mona drops in the slide It isa
picture of Hef from Woodstock He is standing next to a very
muddy very naked very hairy hippy On closer examination we
see that it is a young Mrs Hagstrom and she is grabbing
Hef’s crotch The crowd bursts into heated conversation

SHELLEY (CONTD)
Are these the type of values we
would like to promote Mrs
Hagstrom

MRS HAGSTROM
That is not me

SHELLEY
Then I guess there must be two
people who have a freaky mole on
their neck that looks like a puppy

Mona drops another slide in and we see that it is a close up
of the mole on the hippy’s neck Mrs Hagstrom covers her
neck and starts to stutter

MRS HAGSTROM
But I mean It was The
Sixties
(she goes for the
projector)
You can’t blame me I was shrooming

The hubbubs go crazy Mr Walker bangs a gavel on the table
to get everyone to calm down

MR WALKER
While this is without a doubt the
most interesting meeting I’ve been
to in a while I think it is time
to resolve these issues and move
on So here is how it is going to
work We’re all going to start
over Mrs Hagstrom you’re gonna
tone it down and act like a human
being again from now on with or
without the assistance of
mushrooms

Mrs Hagstrom nods in agreement

MR WALKER (CONTD)

As for the girls of Phi-Mu I wish
I could put you on probation for
being mean and nasty people but I
can’t so I will just tell you try
to be less bitchy

The girls are shocked

MR WALKER (CONT’D)
You heard me

He turns to the Zeta’s

MR WALKER (CONTD)

And that brings us to the Zeta’s
you’re going to keep your house
your dignity and your self esteem
but maybe you could shave your legs
every once in a while

The Zeta’s nod in agreement then celebrate all gathering
around Shelley and hugging her

MR WALKER (CONTD)

But next year you will get enough
pledges and meet all the other
requirements or we will be back
here

MARIA
Yes sir

Ashley walks over and angrily whispers to Mrs Hagstrom
ASHLEY
And you yelled at me for wearing
open toed shoes

The Beer Pong Dude stands up

BEER PONG DUDE
Can we get a copy of that picture

MONA
It’s all yours

Mona flings it out into the crowd
BEER PONG DUDE

us again

SHELLEY
Hef and Marvin get a lot of the
credit too

MARIA
This is so great Everything
worked out perfectly

SHELLEY
Well not perfectly Real
perfection would be me and Oliver
together right now But that can
never be cause I moved to Peru and
only left him a note

TANYA
But you didn’t really move to Peru

SHELLEY
I know that but he doesn’t

Shelley walks towards the kitchen a little dejected

INT ZETA KITCHEN 128

As Shelley enters she sees Oliver standing under a banner
that says “Welcome Back from Peru Shelley” He is holding a
bouquet of flowers Shelley shyly walks over to him All the
girls enter now

SHELLEY
How did you know I was back from
Peru

OLIVER

A little bird told me

SHELLEY
I got to meet this freakin bird and
take him to dinner or something

MARIA
Me I’m the bird I called Oliver
up the minute I found out you were
upset

Shelley is touched She puts her hands over her heart

SHELLEY
(to Maria)
This is what it must feel like to
have a best friend
(MORE)

SHELLEY (CONTD)
(to Oliver)
Now I have to admit something to
you I didn’t go to Peru

OLIVER
Get out of here

Everyone in the room laughs

SHELLEY
Also I was in Playboy

OLIVER
I know Shelly And I have
something to admit to you I was
totally wrong about saying girls in
Playboy are bimbos Because you
are the sweetest funniest most
caring and generous girl I’ve ever
met in my life not to mention your
incredible brain and medium boobs

SHELLEY
So you’ll be my boyfriend

OLIVER
Heck yeah I mean how many guys
who manage a nursing home get to
say they have a Playmate Centerfold
for a girlfriend

SHELLEY
Actually I left before we did the
photo shoot But if you have a
camera I can be your personal
private centerfold

OLIVER
(yelling)
Does anyone have a camera I can
borrow right now I’1l give you
everything I own 1

Shelley laughs as Oliver pulls her in for a kiss We see all
the girls peeking in at the kitchen door Everyone oooohhhhs
and ahhhs We hear a knock on the back door The girls walk
into the kitchen

MONA
Shelley it’s for you

Marvin enters the room still shirtless carrying a suitcase

SHELLEY
Marvin what are you doing here

MARVIN

I’ve been hired as the Zeta House’s
new butler Since you’ll be taking
classes next semester you’ll need
someone to help out around here
Oh and Hef wanted me to let you
know that the Zetas have a lifetime
pass into the mansion

The girls all react psyched

SHELLEY
Marvin I guess all I can say is
welcome to my new family

MARVIN
Ladies I am at your disposal

SHELLEY
Disposal Right I think the
garbage disposal is broken After
you fix that we’ll take some
mMangoritas on the front porch

MARVIN
Not a problem

All the girls come in for a group hug as we fade
