FADE IN

A BIG YELLOW BALLOON

Fills the frame shiny and perfect As we PULL BACK it’s
EXT SANTA MONICA PIER —- DAY

The balloon is handed to a LITTLE GIRL by a VENDOR The girl
smiles at her MOTHER joyous A SECOND GIRL walks by holding
her MOTHERS hand The second girl scowls

SECOND LITTLE GIRL
I want that pretty balloon Mommy

SECOND GIRL’S MOTHER
That’s hers dear You can get your own

SECOND LITTLE GIRL
I don’t want another balloon I want that
one

SECOND GIRL’S MOTHER
I’m sorry sweetie but

The second little girl breaks free from her mother’s hand

SECOND LITTLE GIRL
Give me that balloon

The second girl grabs the string above the shocked first girl’s
clutching hand The first mother looks down daunted

FIRST LITTLE GIRL
It’s my balloon

They struggle -- the balloon slips from their hands and rises

FIRST LITTLE GIRL (CONTD)
Oh Mommy

The four females watch the yellow balloon float away

SECOND LITTLE GIRL
Look what you did

FIRST LITTLE GIRL
You can have the stupid old balloon now

The second little girl smiles big
SECOND LITTLE GIRL
I can Oh thank you See my yellow

balloon Mommy Aren’t I so very lucky

The second girl’s mother gazes down at her daughter bewildered
THE YELLOW BALLOON
Floats high above the ocean As WIND BLOWS

DISSOLVE TO
“FADE IN” ON A COMPUTER MONITOR SCREEN

PULLING BACK the screen is empty until we see “FADE OUT” in
the bottom right corner We are in

INT TARZANA HOUSEOFFICE - DAY

Pulling back fully we see a MAN in his 30’s sitting at a desk
He peers through wire-frame glasses at an open dictionary as he
struggles to tie a heavy ROPE into some knot

CLOSE SHOT ON DICTIONARY PAGE

The ILLUSTRATION is for “NOOSE” depicting a tied rope

ON HIS HANDS AND ROPE

RICK CUNNINGHAM finally shapes the rope into a passable noose
lays it on the desk and contemplates it solemnly

CLOSE ON NOOSE

The TITLE FADES UP framed inside the rope’s ominous loop
“KILLING CHARLIE KAUFMAN”

WIDER

Rick SIGHS stands and holds up the rope -- the noose unravels
to nothing

CUT TO
THE YELLOW BALLOON

Drifts high above the Santa Monica mountains the ocean beyond
WIND HOWLS with a lonely whistle

CUT TO
INT TARZANA HOUSEGARAGE - DAY

Standing on a ladder Rick ties one end of the rope to a rafter
over the cement floor He examines a knotted mess of a loop
nothing like a noose Rick SIGHS and slips the tangled rope
around his neck He turns ceremoniously ready He starts to
jump off the ladder but hesitates He braces himself
ANGLE ON GARAGE WINDOW

Overlooking a swimming pool in the backyard
THE YELLOW BALLOON

Eases down from the sky and lands in the pool
RICK

Gets a curious look He slips off the noose hops off the ladder
and goes to the window

CLOSER ANGLE ON POOL THROUGH WINDOW

The yellow balloon eddies lazily

RICK

Watches the balloon and shakes his head peeved

RICK
Goddamn birthdays

WIDER ON GARAGE

Rick turns climbs back up the ladder slips the lousy noose
over his head and readies to jump -- again hesitation A PHONE
RINGS He listens A SECOND RING A THIRD RING

Rick SIGHS frustrated reaches behind him and produces a
CORDLESS PHONE that was apparently clipped to his hip pocket

RICK (CONTD)
Hello

ANDREW (VO)
Hey Rick Andrew and Darrell

DARRELL (VO)
What’re you up to

RICK
(slight beat)
Just hanging around the garage

ANDREW (VO)
I wouldn’t guess you to be the handy
type We’ve got good news and bad news
Rick feels the tangled rope at his neck pensively

RICK
Did you say “bad noose”
DARRELL (VO)

Yes but the good news first -- we got a
show picked up and we want you to write
on it

Rick smiles the rope around his neck still
ANDREW (VO)
The bad news is that out of our four
pilots the one the network boneheads
picked was the Donny Most Show
DARRELL (VO)
Dead silence they heard Got any better
offers
Rick gazes up and tugs the rope tied to the rafter playfully
INT TARZANA HOUSEKITCHEN - DAY
Rick enters from the garage excited Standing at the counter a
pretty WOMAN in her 30s SUE CUNNINGHAM looks up from cutting
the tops off of carrots
SUE
Sorry I couldn’t get the phone What’re
you doing out there

Rick grabs her shoulders smiling

RICK
I got a show

Sue smiles and they kiss
SUE
I knew that yellow balloon landing in our

pool was a good omen

Rick gazes out the sliding door realizing how close he came to
missing his phone call He smiles intrigued

RICK
Maybe it was

ANGLE ON POOL

The yellow balloon swirls around then POPS
RICK AND SUE

Both stare at the pool shaken

RICK (CONTD)
Omens are bullshit
ANGLE ON POPPED BALLOON SHREDS
Sinking fast into the water
CUT TO
A DONNY MOST HEADSHOT PHOTO
He smiles big older than we last saw him WIDER REVEALS
INT SITCOM CONFERENCE ROOM —- DAY

EIGHT WRITERS sit around a long table most with coffee
CHATTING TWO WOMEN and the rest MEN including Rick The Donny
Most photo is taped to a wall at the room’s center TWO MEN
enter with folders amiable and in their 30’s Everyone turns as
they sit at the end of the table

ANDREW
Morning people Welcome to the Donny
Most Show

Everyone CHUCKLES ironically

ANDREW (CONT’D)
Now we all know we’d rather be doing
something else than writing on this show
but the network has promised not to
cancel it for the whole twenty-six
episodes

DARRELL
Rumor has it that the top bitch suit is
secretly Donny’s sister or has banged him
for years or both

Everyone LAUGHS

ANDREW
Whatever the ugly reason you guys have a
job for a full year if you can stand it
and as we all know that’s pretty rare
Wed like to introduce everyone

DARRELL
First as I’m sure you all realize we
have Richie Cunningham

Everyone LAUGHS or smiles except Rick

ANDREW
There was no way we could resist hiring
Richie C to write for Ralph Malph

The chuckles die down as everyone watches Rick’s humorless face
RICK
Ralph Malph

Darrell and Andrew eye Rick thrown

ANDREW
You know “Happy Days”

Rick stares stiffening up Darrell peers at Rick unsure

DARRELL
The television show

Rick looks panicked and embarrassed

RICK
I don’t watch TV

Everyone has stony faces
DARRELL
Are you fucking kidding You don’t watch
TV and you’re working in sitcoms

Clearly nervous Rick gazes at Darrell blankly

RICK
What’s a sitcom

SILENCE hangs over unsettled faces

ANGLE ON ONE GUY

Who breaks into a smile watching the embarrassed Rick
INT RICK’S SITCOM OFFICE - DAY

Rick sits at a computer staring at the screen

ANGLE ON MONITOR

“FADE IN” is the only thing on the screen

BACK WIDE

The writer who smiled at the conference table leans in

unimposing smaller-framed man

CHARLIE
Charlie Kaufman

Charlie reaches over the desk Rick stands reaching

RICK
Rick Cunningham

Rick and Charlie shake then Rick sits back down Charlie
in a chair grinning

CHARLIE
So all that about not watching television
was an act right

RICK
I never watch TV shows ever But I sure
as hell know about “Happy Days”

Charlie smiles more

CHARLIE
Yeah

RICK
Ever since that accursed show hit the
air I haven’t had a week go by without
some cretin calling me Richie C or
asking me how the Fonz is

CHARLIE
It is sort of funny then for you to be
writing for Donny Most

RICK
I guess Are you the guy who wrote on the
Chris Elliott show

CHARLIE
That would be me

RICK
That’s my favorite show of all time

CHARLIE
I thought you didn’t watch TV

Rick eyes Charlie stone-faced and shrugs

RICK
I don’t even know who Chris Elliott is
But since you’re the only one in the room
(MORE)

sits
RICK(CONTD)

get on your good side

Charlie smiles at the straightforwardness of Rick

RICK (CONTD)
So what was this Chris Elliott like

CHARLIE
He’s a pretty strange guy

RICK
I like him already

Charlie smiles then Rick finally does
INT DONNY MOST SHOW SOUNDSTAGE —- DAY

A run-through is in progress SUITS sit together in the stands
watching stiffly On the other side of the aisle the writers
sit slumped bored Present-day DONNY MOST moves around a sitcom
living room set surrounded by his apparent SITCOM WIFE his
wacky NEIGHBOR LANCE and a sitcom TEENAGE BOY and GIRL They
all read their lines from scripts

DONNY
So you mean no one mentioned my birthday
all day because everyone actually did
forget it

SITCOM WIFE
Sorry honey but things have been so
hectic

SITCOM TEENAGE SON
You wanted me to clean my room remember
Dad If you only had a birthday cake
right now boy you could eat it off of
my floor

SITCOM TEENAGE GIRL
And I was at the gas station like you
asked taking off my top

Donny drops his mouth open feigning shock

DONNY
I said to top off your tank

The sitcom daughter gives a coy sexy look

SITCOM TEENAGE GIRL
Oops
ANGLE ON STANDS
The executives all CRACK UP
BACK ON SET

LANCE
Besides who wants to be reminded they’re
another year closer to cuddlin’ up with a
nice cozy dirt blanket
(signature line with gesture)

Not me nooooooo siiiiiiiir-eeeeeeeeee
THE EXECUTIVES
CRACK UP again one guy slapping his knee
THE WRITERS

Roll their eyes agonized All the writers except Charlie lean
over put their index fingers to Rick’s head and pretend to
shoot him

BACK ON SET

DONNY
Well if a fella ultimately has no choice
but to die is it so much to ask once a
year for a little yummy cake and a few
cheery balloons to make up for that
impending demise

Donny drops his script shaking his head

DONNY (CONTD)
Jesus this is terrible It’s so
depressing

Darrell and Andrew are on the floor

ANDREW
It’s bucking the obligatory surprise
birthday episode every sitcom ever made
has done

DARRELL
We can be the first show to twist that
idiotic convention on its ear

DONNY
This isn’t all-star wrestling guys It
has to be funny
(turns to stands)
Which fucking quote-unquote “writer”
squeezed out this piece of shit
Rick raises his hand

RICK
That’d be me

DONNY
You who What’s your name

Everyone waits on pins and needles fighting grins

RICK
Richard Cunningham

Everyone CRACKS UP SNICKERING Donny nods fuming

DONNY
Yeah real fucking funny And I’m the
Fonz

DARRELL

That really is his name Donny

ANDREW
Seriously

Donny stares taken aback

DONNY
Really
(slowly smiles)
You mean Richie C is writing for Ralph
Mouth That’s kind of funny you know

No writers smile

DARRELL
We’ve all known that for three weeks
‘cause we look at the fucking staff
lists

Donny loses his smile angry again

DONNY
Having Richie C is the only thing funny
about this show so far This script needs
a total rewrite That’s lunch

All the writers roll their eyes The DIRECTOR glares at Donny

SHOW DIRECTOR
Donny I’m the director -- I call lunch

DONNY
Oh bite me Who do you think you are
Ron Howard

Donny marches off the set and the director flips him off
INT SITCOM OFFICES HALLWAY —- DAY
Rick passes a FEMALE WRITER LISA in the hall
LISA
(teasing)
Nice going Richie You should be writing

for “Un-happy Days”

RICK
Aren’t I

Rick knocks on a closed door as he opens it

RICK (CONTD)
Hey Charlie

INT CHARLIE’S SITCOM OFFICE

Rick stops as he sees Charlie has red eyes looking upset
Charlie wipes tears from his cheek embarrassed

RICK
(backing out)
Jesus I’m sorry

CHARLIE
Yeah just shut the door

Rick enters shutting the door and sits

RICK
Want to talk about it

Charlie shrugs shakes his head then SNIFFS

CHARLIE
My marriage is kind of messed up

RICK
I’m sorry to hear that

Charlie tries to smile but can’t pull it off

RICK (CONTD)
Is it hopeless

Charlie looks at Rick getting an extremely sad face

CHARLIE
I think so

Charlie swivels his chair away Rick stares at the back of
Charlie’s head thinking of what to say

RICK
I’m not exactly great with these kinds of
situations but if you ever need to talk
to somebody there are people all up and
down this hall

Charlie’s back shakes as he chuckles silently
RICK (CONTD)

And if you decide the bitch simply has to

die get her hired here and tell Donny

she’s me You’d be single in a week
Charlie swivels back around smiling with red eyes Rick smiles
EXT STUDIO PARKING LOT - DAY
Rick starts up his car which is a piece of crap and turns to
look as he backs out of his parking space He shifts gears and
starts down the road past parked cars picking up speed

DONNY MOST

Darts in front of Rick’s car from between two vans -- turns with
frightened surprise as RICK’S CAR HITS HIM knocking him down

DONNY
Augh
WIDE AGAIN
Rick gets shocked eyes as the car bounces up -- Donny SCREAMS
out and Rick brakes
RICK

Uh oh
INT SITCOM CONFERENCE ROOM —- NIGHT

The writers sit around the table glaring angrily into space --
except for Charlie and TOM gruff-looking and older than the
others who have faint smiles

TOM
You gotta admit it’s sort of funny that
Ralph the Mouth got run over by Richie C
Most people glare at Tom Tom smiles deflated

TOM (CONTD)
I think it’s funny

The conference room door opens -- in the hall THREE COPS are
parting from Rick

COP 1
If we have any more questions we’1ll
contact you

RICK
Sure thing Good night

The cops leave and Rick enters the room slowing as he sees the
angry faces

RICK (CONTD)
Hi guys

No answer Finally

TOM
So did they get the name of that
sleazebag who dove under your car

Tom smiles at Rick who tries to smile back

RICK

Look it wasn’t my fault Otherwise
those cops would be carting me off to
jail for my second honeymoon Right

(uncomfortable silence)
There was a witness and they said Donny
was completely to blame The cops were
laughing about it

Andrew and Darrell enter the room downcast Everyone looks up

ANDREW
Hey everyone Donny’s legs are going to
take about twelve weeks to heal

Several people GASP A WOMAN WRITER JULIE drops her head to
the table with a THUNK

DARRELL
(restrained anger)
So the show is cancelled

About half the writers say

SEVERAL WRITERS
Fuck

Julie stands grabs her things and walks huffily out of the
room Lisa stands and leaves glaring at Rick At the door Lisa
gives Rick the finger The guys stand up one after another and
leave all with looks of hate at Rick One man stops and peers
into Rick’s face

ART
I just bought a new house asshole

Darrell glares at Rick his jaw clenched

DARRELL
I don’t know if you’re a good writer but
you sure can’t drive for shit

Darrell storms out trying to contain himself Andrew musters a
smile and holds out his hand

ANDREW
Great working with you -- the whole darn
month Let’s try two next time

Rick lifelessly shakes Andrew’s hand then Andrew exits Tom
stands stretching

TOM
Well Richie C nice knowing you And
the next time you see the Fonz tell him
to get the fuck out of your way

Tom pats Rick on the back and exits Charlie remains seated

RICK
You wouldn’t happen to have a can of gas
and a match would you

CHARLIE
I want to thank you

Rick looks surprised

RICK
Why

Charlie stands and wanders over

CHARLIE
I’ve hated every second working on this
show I’m thrilled to be put out of its
misery So thanks

RICK
You’re so very welcome
CHARLIE
(grins)
I wish I could have seen his face when it
happened
Rick smiles slightly

RICK
It was pretty damn funny between you and
me He was like a freckly red-faced deer
in headlights
Charlie holds out his hand and they shake

CHARLIE
You’re a very weird screwed-up guy

RICK
Thanks

CHARLIE
Let’s keep in touch

Charlie heads for the door

RICK
Good luck with your marriage

Charlie turns around with a cynical look

CHARLIE
Can you get that cancelled too

RICK
I’m afraid that’s your job

Charlie smiles and exits Rick turns and looks at the empty
room He spots the Donny Most photo on the wall glances out the
door goes over and grabs a MARKER off an easel

development deal going

CHARLIE

RICK
Well shit

CHARLIE
It’s for the best believe me

Rick SIGHS tries to change the subject
RICK
So you never told me anything about your

screenplay

CHARLIE
I can’t talk about it yet

Rick leans on the rail looking out
RICK

Come on Give me something to grin about
while I drive to Texas

Charlie SIGHS and leans on the rail too

CHARLIE
Well it’s about a guy who gets this
terrible job And the offices are so
crummy they’re actually between floors
so you have to bend over to walk around

RICK
That sounds funny

CHARLIE
This guy ends up finding a little door
behind his file cabinet and it turns out
to be a way into John Malkovich’s mind

Rick has a strange skeptical look

RICK
No shit Why John Malkovich

CHARLIE
I don’t know I really like him as an
actor I guess

RICK
(CHUCKLES )
Well at the least it’ll be a good
sample for any offbeat assignments that
come along -- especially if they happen
to star John Malkovich

CHARLIE
I guess

Rick grins and takes a sip of beer
RICK

Jesus Charlie You may be weirder than

me You poor creature

The front door opens and Rick wanders out in his robe looking
worse for the wear He approaches the fat SUNDAY PAPER lying on
the sidewalk Rick stops gazing down at the paper petrified
He slowly reaches down hesitates with his hand in the air then
picks it up

ANGLE ON RICK

Rick regards the newspaper with grim cautious apprehension
After a long beat Rick drops the paper to the ground stepping
back to clear it Rick stares at the paper wondering if he’s
just avoided catastrophe He turns back towards the house --

ANGLE ON HOUSE

The house has TRANSFORMED INTO AN EVEN WORSE HOUSE -- much
smaller much uglier His family has evidently moved to

EXT SANTA CLARITA SHACK

It looks no bigger than four rooms total Ugly bare trees and
pieces of trash litter the yard Rick numbly regards the tiny
house utterly perplexed Unable to understand Rick finally
plods up to the house defeated

INT SANTA CLARITA SHACKLIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rick is watching TV by himself in the dark He picks up the
remote and starts channel-surfing He comes to

Some John Malkovich movie When his face comes on Rick clicks
the remote angrily The next channel shows

A John Cusack movie Rick sees him and hits the remote button
A Cameron Diaz movie Rick changes the channel
Another John Malkovich movie Change

“Being John Malkovich” -- a scene with John Cusack Rick raises
the remote ready to change when ROGER EBERT comes on

ROGER EBERT

Well now Cusack director Spike Jonze
and screenwriter Kaufman re-team for the
incredible new “Adaptation” This film is
up at most film festivals in the world
competing with yet another Charlie
Kaufman film “Human Nature” Too bad Jim
Carrey and George Clooney were too busy
to film their Kaufman projects sooner or
Charlie’d have four films out around the
same time The freshest thing about
“Adaptation” is that it’s largely about
writer Charlie Kaufman himself trying to
write the movie in fact he’s the main
character Can you fucking believe that
Rick

(beat looking at camera)
Oh Ri-ick Rick Cunningham you there

CLOSE ANGLE ON RICK’S FACE

His vacant eyes don’t blink as saliva drips down his chin

barely see out of them

RICK

The woman eyes Rick scared and looks down at her book

RECEPTIONIST

Richard Cunningham

The receptionist looks up with a timid smile

RECEPTIONIST
Oh Seen the Fonz lately

Rick glares at her She grows very flustered

RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
Not with those glasses I guess

Rick SIGHS annoyed and signs in He turns and heads for a
seat He stops to pick a magazine reaching down --

ANGLE ON MAGAZINE TABLE

Most magazines are entertainment-related -- and most have FACES
or MOVIE STILLS from Charlie Kaufman films on the covers along
with related HEADLINES Even a Golf magazine features a PHOTO of
a goofily-dressed John Malkovich swinging a club with the
headline “GOLFING JOHN MALKOVICH”

RICK

Gets a sour look retracts his hand walks over and takes a
seat He turns away from the magazine table in distaste

INT PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY
An amiable PSYCHOLOGIST sits in a chair

DR ESCHBACHER
So are you here to talk about problems or
to get new glasses

The doctor smiles good-naturedly Rick sits in a chair
uncomfortable looking strange in his black-smeared glasses

RICK
I had sort of a paint accident

DR ESCHBACHER
Your wife told me about that

RICK
I tried paint thinner but it ran out
And I couldn’t go to the hardware store
for more because it’s next-door to a
video store and I might accidentally
see

Rick realizes he’s about to sound crazy and looks down

DR ESCHBACHER
Might accidentally see what

RICK
Nothing

DR ESCHBACHER
A poster for a Charlie Kaufman film

Rick shyly nods

RICK
Or see someone leaving with a tape or
DVD of his or pass a billboard ad

or hear customers talking about one of
Charlie’s films

(looks at doctor)
I know it sounds crazy That’s why I’m
here I guess Is there any hope for me

DR ESCHBACHER
Absolutely Mr Cunningham There is no
doubt whatsoever that you are suffering
from “Charlie Envy”

The doctor smiles Rick sits up and stares in disbelief

RICK
What

DR ESCHBACHER
“Charlie Envy” It’s the fastest-growing
mental disorder in Southern California --
and it’s popping up globally It afflicts
not just screenwriters former coworkers
and ex-friends of Charlie Kaufman but
total strangers who wish they were as
smart hip and successful as him

RICK
(stunned)
And I thought I was the only one

DR ESCHBACHER
The good news is that a helpful new drug
is about to be approved by the FDA It’s
called the “Being Charlie Kaufman” drug --
“BECK” for short

Rick looks sick to his stomach

RICK
I don’t think it’s for me

DR ESCHBACHER
Why it’s tailor-made for you It
simulates in the user the feelings of
success and confidence they’d have if
(MORE)
DR ESCHBACHER (CONTD)
they were Charlie Kaufman Between you
and me -- it’s supposed to be quite a
buzz

The doctor winks Rick stares more baffled than ever

Rick stares

RICK
So not only has that little bastard given
me a mental problem but he got it named
after him -- and -- the cure is named
after him too -- based on his own film’s
title Who the hell is his agent

DR ESCHBACHER
Unfortunately this wonder drug won’t be
available for a few weeks And to be
perfectly honest I won’t be much help to
you really

RICK
‘Cause it’s such a unique elusive
problem to pin down

DR ESCHBACHER
No -- I’m a huge Kaufman fan As far as
I’m concerned he’s God and I would have
no choice but to crush any man who dared
defame his great genius I know that’s
not professional but I can’t help it

RICK
(blankly)
We’re only mortal you and I

at the smiling man who grabs a pad and writes

DR ESCHBACHER
However I can recommend a group of like-
minded people that gathers weekly where
you might able to sort out some of your
issues

RICK
Okay Maybe

Dr Eschbacher rips off the page and hands it to Rick

DR ESCHBACHER
Good luck And to help you feel back to
normal you really should get some new
lenses

RICK
Cant My optician’s next to a multiplex
showing a Charlie movie

The doctor shrugs understandingly

before the series was abruptly cancelled

Art and Steve glare at Rick fiercely
RICK (CONTD)
After the show we kept up for a couple
of years

Art and Steve exchange “Hey not me” looks

RICK (CONTD)
That’s really about it

GERALD
(expectantly)
And what happened after he sold

ready to take notes Rick looks around puzzled A FAT SAD-
FACED GUY KIP raises his hand

KIP
Can I go first

GERALD
You always have wonderful things to
share Take it away Kip

KIP
Well I had a new one
(clears throat settles)
Im walking in the woods just enjoying
nature and what-not

Everyone listens intently Kip’s depressed face comes to joyful

vibrant life as he speaks

KIP (CONTD)
I decide to see what’s making this big
whooshing sound I go down and find this
river and I think well that’s a lot of
noise for such a meager river So I go
further along and I finally come to a
breath-taking waterfall plunging a
hundred feet to a lovely valley below
I’m standing there truly awestruck
beholding this gorgeous panorama when I
look over and happen to notice of all
people Charlie Kaufman

Everyone nods grinning weirdly many guys scribbling notes
Rick eyes them all dubiously

GERALD
Go on

KIP
He’s sitting on this boulder of course
yakking on a cell phone with De Niro or
somebody So I pick up this canteloupe-
sized rock I sneak up behind Charlie --
and I smash his skull in

VARIOUS GROUP MEMBERS
Yes Yes

Everyone’s worked up some with sweat on their foreheads

KIP
And I smash it and smash it and smash it
and smash it until there’s nothing left
to smash Then --
(smiles bigger)
-- after I decapitate what’s left of his
head I pick up his lifeless body --

Kip raises his arms and acts out the motion he describes

KIP (CONTD)
And I fling that rich little motherfucker
over the waterfall He plummets down the
raging water and rips to hideous chunks
on the jagged rocks below

Everyone breaks into APPLAUSE cheering Kip who takes a proud
bow breathing fast and sweating

GERALD
As always Kip beautiful Next

Everyone waves their hand excitedly like schoolchildren Rick
stares around the faces in utter disbelief

No Chris the water first

CHRIS ELLIOTT

So then as Charlie blazes screaming like
a girl I throw a pot of scalding salt
water on him Hee hee hee hoo

DANA CARVEY
(points at Chris)
Then we pull out the soil tiller we
previously hid in the linen closet and
churn Charlie’s torso into pea soup

Dana and Chris LAUGH heartily as the rest of the room
them Chris gets an odd look stops laughing

CHRIS ELLIOTT
Wait a darn minute -- a linen closet
isn’t big enough to stick a tiller

DANA CARVEY
Charlie’s is -- Spade’s been over and he
told me about it

CHRIS ELLIOTT
(smug)
If you say so I doubt it though

Dana shakes his head indicating Chris is stupid
DANA CARVEY

Anyway then of course we cut off his
fucking head

off And there I was just Brad not
feeling a bit confident or talented or
happy bittersweet or otherwise

Everyone stares off as they contemplate this dilemma Rick
watches Brad intently

KIP
But once it’s on the market we can just
take it all the time right

Brad is lost in his thoughts his eyes not meeting anyone’s

BRAD
The reason I brought this up is that as I
kept taking the Charlie drug feeling the
way he does supposedly I started
realizing that I don’t think he ever
intended to make any of us feel bad

STEVE
Then how come he shit on us

BRAD
I don’t know Maybe if I could take the
drug longer -- if all of us could -- wed

understand I just sensed that not only
did Charlie not intend for anyone to feel
miserable on his account but that if he
could he’d stop that feeling in us But
he can’t Only we can fix that I guess

Everyone is quiet reflecting on this
RICK

Studies Brad

RICK
I say “Fuck Charlie”

BRAD
Flinches and gazes at Rick bewildered

Brad silently slips out the door -- Rick watches him
GERALD

And on that uplifting note I bid you all

a good night
Everyone stands stretching saying good night to each other
Rick rushes out of the library Gerald turns and using a
tissue picks up the “Malkovich” videotape and restores it to
its display stand He makes a repulsed face and turns

EXT JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

Rick rushes outside looking around He spots Brad walking down
the sidewalk Rick jogs after him

RICK
Excuse me

Brad looks back but doesn’t stop Rick gets to him

RICK (CONTD)
Hi Rick Cunningham

BRAD
Can I help you

RICK
I’m extremely interested in this Charlie
pill

Brad studies Rick’s face

BRAD
Why You’d never want to feel like him
You said “fuck Charlie”

RICK
Yes -- as a test

Brad gets confused eyes Rick smiles

RICK (CONTD)
It sure did bother you to hear Charlie
put down

Brad peers at Rick looking cornered

BRAD
Listen -- I lied I didn’t test the drug
I just hate violence so I never have
anything to say I came up with all that
garbage so I’d have something to add

RICK
Come on you took it When you were
talking I felt like I was watching and
listening to Charlie -- but wearing 38
Longs

Brad looks at him shocked
BRAD
You’re saying I was acting like
Charlie
RICK
(nods )
It was kind of creepy to be honest
Brad is lost in his thoughts
BRAD
My girlfriend insists I’ve been different

ever since the testing

RICK
Have you talked to any other guinea pigs

Brad shakes his head slowly
BRAD
Do you realize the hellish implications
if you’re right The only true relief
from this Charlie envy slowly mutates
your personality until you’re just
another version of him

Rick is mulling this over Brad stares numbly

BRAD (CONTD)
It means there’s no way out

RICK
That’s quite a Catch Twenty-Two

Brad looks at Rick with frightened eyes

BRAD
Good night fellow inmate

Brad turns as Rick holds out a piece of paper and pen
RICK
Look give me your number I’d like to

talk more Okay

Brad eyes him stonily then grabs the pen and paper and writes
something Brad thrusts it at Rick

BRAD
I sleep ‘til ten

Brad turns and walks off an eerie figure

RICK
Sure thing ten

Rick watches unsettled as Brad walks into darkness

EXT SANTA CLARITA SHACKBACKYARD —- DAY

Rick reclines in a rusty lawn chair in the dirt yard by a kiddie
pool with not enough air the dirty water full of leaves -- a
sad fifth cousin to the Hollywood dream Rick has eyes closed
behind sunglasses At the SOUND OF WIND Rick opens his eyes to
see above him --

A VULTURE

Perching on an ugly bare tree branch The vulture gazes down at
Rick as A SECOND VULTURE lands in the tree Then THIRD and

GUN CLERK

RICK
(disappointed)
Ten days

The clerk looks at him wary

GUN CLERK
Yeah you know -- the “Cooling Off
Period” So you can’t shoot somebody just
‘cause you’re pissed at them

RICK
How about if you’re pissed at yourself

The clerk studies Rick cautiously

GUN CLERK
Either way cool off I guess
(sly grin)
Or else stay pissed for ten days

RICK

Rick gazes at the monitor for a moment then turns and picks up
the gun He gingerly sticks it up to his mouth and closes his

lips around it A beat then Rick grimaces pulling out the gun

RICK
Jesus -- bleck

Rick smacks his lips repulsed He raises the gun and holds it
to his forehead He tries to look up at the gun going cross-
eyed He moves the gun to his temple His finger moves ready to
pull the trigger He closes his eyes determined Rick’s eyes
suddenly pop open wide

RICK (CONTD)
Why am I doing this to me

Rick thinks as he lowers the gun to the desk
RICK (CONTD)
I’m not the one who made me feel
worthless This is all Charlie’s fault

Rick grins intensely at the “gun

RICK (CONTD)
Im killing the wrong guy

does anybody at least know where he hangs
out or eats a lot washes his Jag

Anything
Gerald eyes Rick curiously

GERALD
Why are you so wound up about finding
Charlie

Rick is flustered tries for nonchalance

RICK
I just feel like saying “Howdy” you
know But I don’t know how to get ahold
of him so I figure the best approach
would be to appear to just run into him
You know

Rick looks around the faces nervously hoping they bought it

ART
Why bother He’d just blow you off and
you know it

DANNY

Can we get on to regular business I have
a beauty involving a trash compactor

Everyone stares at Rick no answers

RICK
Oh well Thanks for your help

Rick starts for the door

GERALD
Aren’t you staying for the sharing

RICK
No time I’m working on a new project

Rick smiles mysteriously and exits Gerald goes to the podium

is there but labelled with “NEW” sit VIDEO TAPES OF

“ADAPTATION” and “HUMAN NATURE” along with a couple “MAKING OF”
TAPES A prominent SIGN reads “LOVING CHARLIE KAUFMAN MONTH”

Ask Richie here about it sometime

The writer regards Rick curiously -- Rick glares back stonily
Daunted the young writer exits

hire the star-killer on a show eerily
connected to my past crime

The new brass are younger than that kid
who just left They only started reading
period a few years ago much less the
trades

ANDREW
But when they saw your name on our writer
list they thought it would be just
hilarious to hire you You can thank the

come

You’re incapable of killing to ease even
the worst pain But you are capable of
writing about killing Perhaps that might
soothe your soul

The nurse pulls a NOTE PAD from a uniform pocket then produces
a PEN and sets them on the night stand

NURSE (CONT’D)
Write down everything that comes to you

The nurse pulls from another pocket a SMALL FLASHLIGHT and
switches it on softly ILLUMINATING HER FACE -- she looks like

CAMERON DIAZ in “Being John Malkovich” Her NAME TAG reads
“THALIA” She smiles warmly

NURSE (CONT’D)
All of your troubles can be solved by
writing

The nurse clicks the LIGHT OFF and sets it by the note pad and
pen She smooths back Rick’s hair from his forehead

NURSE (CONT’D)
Now sleep Or write -- you need both

Rick somehow manages to get out

RICK
Thank you

NURSE
(enigmatic smile)
Just doing my job

The nurse seems to float toward the door which opens magically
She drifts out the door and it shuts itself behind her

page of the note pad

RICK
Hang onto that thought

Elderly Sue gets a deflated look and the homely children stare
at Rick Even Chris now resembles a troll

CHRIS

Rick holds up his finger absorbed in thought The nurse frowns
and clasps his wrist to take it

the young man onto the bed He instantly picks up the TV REMOTE

water pitcher hugging it too

RICK (CONTD)

The nurse makes a face and wheels Rick across the room Rick
looks at Jason watching TV

RICK (CONTD)
See you later Jason Good luck with your
abscessed navel ring hole

The nurse pauses pushing Rick irritated

JASON

fear opening the Sunday paper Was it
worth fifteen years to be able to leave

Rick scribbles a signature and hands the script to Charlie who
glances at it smiles and rolls it up again

It was pretty funny didn’t you think

Yes thanks Maybe I’m not such a bad
writer after all

Charlie gets an other-worldly smile

Which reads “Charlie Thanks for the help” followed by a
flowing signature

BACK ON RICK AND CHARLIE
Rick stares utterly undone He looks to Charlie

RICK
Something tells me you can explain this

CHARLIE
To a certain extent but you’ll have to
make some leaps of logic

RICK
What’s logic

Charlie CHUCKLES as he takes Rick’s elbow and they start
strolling around the ticket booth
CHARLIE
I remember that “sitcom” line of yours
the day we met Well enough reminiscing

It’s dawning on Rick -- he turns

RICK
It was the Charlie Kaufman drug

Charlie smiles at Rick’s quick connection

CHARLIE
I’m afraid so

RICK
But BECK was pulled by the FDA

CHARLIE
Until the pharmaceutical company prepared
a modified formula

RICK
Still I never took it

CHARLIE
Donny told the police that when he was
following you you were following me and
that you aimed a gun at me

Charlie smiles as Rick stares into space

RICK
That’s why he’s Ralph the Mouth

CHARLIE
Based on that scenario your doctors and
Sue opted to try the new BECK on you It
was approved for testing a week or so
into your coma

Charlie pats Rick’s arm as they circle the box office

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
So they dripped the revised Charlie
Kaufman drug into you while you drifted
in the abyss slowly turning into me The
week before you came out of the coma
BECK was pulled again -- more disturbing
cases of confused identity -- so you
never knew what hit you

Rick is thinking trying to follow this

RICK
So I woke up wrote the script signed it
as you and voluntarily handed it to you

CHARLIE

(nods )
Then you conveniently had a rather
lengthy coma due to BECK withdrawal I
sold the script and got it quickly
produced You got the money which is
only fair I think and I got the credit
which was your own doing let’s be
honest By the way you’1ll keep signing
my name for another few weeks So odd
don’t you think

Rick looks ready to explode Suddenly he grins

RICK
Wait a minute If I signed your name
somebody would’ve seen it and told me
before tonight

CHARLIE
Remember those leaps of logic I warned
you about This is one Actually what
you’re experiencing right now is the
movie about you seeing the movie you just
saw about the movie you wrote about you
writing a movie about trying to kill me

Rick stares at Charlie blankly One eye twitches

RICK
Goddammit Just stop it with that crap
would you

Charlie smiles faintly

CHARLIE
Ironically during coma number two I was
brought in by the studio to rewrite my
own screenplay

Rick is really trying to follow nodding

RICK
Well sure

CHARLIE
Once I really got into your script I
noticed that you established the thread
about Brad signing my name on his suicide
note because of the BECK but then you
dropped the ball and did nothing with it
Rick eyes Charlie with another shade of disbelief

CHARLIE (CONTD)
So I put in the Charlie signature twist
at the end then went back to the
hospital sequence and had BECK pumped
into you without your knowledge And I
had to throw in coma number two so the
movie could be produced

RICK
(dazed)
And also so you could rewrite the
script so you could throw in coma
number two so you could rewrite the
script throw in coma number two

Charlie CHUCKLES shaking his head

Rick stops walking with a determined look of defiance

Rick stares

CHARLIE
I know -- it got nearly impossible for me
to keep straight

RICK
Wait Then how come I didn’t see your
changes in the movie just now Ha

CHARLIE
“Leap time” again -- because you’re in
the layer of reality where I’ve rewritten
your character so that you never
suspected anything until this scene where
I reveal the mind-fuck to you outside the
theater

at Charlie numb

RICK
So you mean us standing here right
now -- you wrote everything each of us is
saying This is all your doing

Charlie is thinking back sincerely

CHARLIE
To be fair I think you did have a
confrontation scene after the premiere
but it sort of went nowhere So I guess
it’s based on your idea Feel better

RICK
No

Charlie smiles good-naturedly Rick stares a long time trying
to understand Rick finally shrugs giving up

RICK (CONTD)
Well I guess you really are God Who the
hell is your agent

Charlie smiles then remembers
CHARLIE

Oh and I took the liberty of rewriting
your name In order to lessen the Richie

Cunningham cracks -- in the movie and in
real life -- I started “Rick” with a “W”
I’m surprised it never dawned on you to
try that

Rick stares at Charlie blankly for a long beat Finally

RICK
Rewrite this God

Rick viciously grabs Charlie’s throat choking him as hard as he
can They tumble to the ground struggling

CLOSE ON CHARLIE

Shock and fear fill his face which flushes a deep red
CLOSE ON RICK

His eyes are wild and crazed He jerks tightening his grip

ANGLE ON LOBBY INSIDE

Somebody sees Rick and Charlie on the ground -- they point and
yell muffled from inside The entire lobby full of people turn
and look -- everybody rushes out the doors

RICK

Keeps his hold on Charlie’s neck grunting with effort
CLOSE ON CHARLIE

Charlie’s tongue hangs out his eyes vacant no longer
struggling

WIDE ON AREA OUTSIDE THEATER

The entire audience gathers around Rick strangling Charlie
utterly silent and shocked

ANGLE ON MEDIA PLATFORM

Talent and crew all stand watching A LIGHTING MAN switches off
the camera light he holds

ANOTHER ANGLE ON SCENE

Everyone watches in silence as Rick finally lets go his grip
Rick gazes at Charlie’s still face then stands He gazes around
the crowd dishevelled and breathing hard

Rick starts to edge between people -- they stand apart letting

Rick pass The rest of the crowd parts as if by instinct
allowing Rick to walk toward the street

DANNY (0C)
Say Rick

Rick turns to see Danny with the rest of the support group They
watch Rick warily

DANNY (CONTD)
Aren’t you gonna cut off his fuckin’
head
Rick regards the support group and shakes his head

RICK
I’m happy

Rick notices Sue Chris and Nicky at the front of the crowd Sue
and Rick exchange faint smiles Chris and Nicky watch blankly

ANOTHER ANGLE ON THEATER FRONT

Rick turns and wanders into the empty street A CAR silently
rolls up alongside Rick and stops

ANGLE ON CAR

The passenger window rolls down Rick bends to peer in but the
DRIVER sits in darkness

MYSTERIOUS DRIVER
Want a lift

Rick thinks a moment

RICK
Why not Film’s over

Rick opens the passenger door and gets in Rick turns smiles
and waves to the crowd as the car rolls silently down the
street A moment of silence then a HOARSE RASPY SOUND

ANGLE ON THEATER FRONT

Everyone turns and looks down -- Charlie SUCKS IN AIR and
COUGHS stirring Everyone lights up hopeful

VARIOUS ONLOOKERS
Charlie

Sue Chris and Nicky look happiest of all -- tears of joy spill
down Sue’s face TWO FAMILIAR MEN push through the crowd and
kneel next to Charlie MARTIN SCORCESE pats Charlie’s chest
smiling big

SCORCESE
He’s alive folks

The crowd CHEERS FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA SIGHS happily relieved
JOEL and ETHAN COEN approach and kneel beside Charlie

ETHAN COEN
Charlie came back to us

JOEL COEN
Thank God -- or whatever your sad
idiosyncratic conception of universal
consciousness is
ANGLE STRAIGHT ABOVE SCENE

Francis Ford Coppola raises his arms high and calls heavenward

COPPOLA
Cinema can live on

The camera rises above this joyful group of people
DISSOLVE TO
EXT MYSTERIOUS CARWESTWOOD BLVD - NIGHT
The car rolls down Westwood Boulevard
ANGLE INSIDE CAR
Rick stares out the windshield pleasantly
RICK
Thanks for the ride By the way I’m

Richie Cunningham

MYSTERIOUS DRIVER
What do you know -- I’m Ralph Malph

They drive past a well-lit store which LIGHTS UP THE DRIVERS
FACE -- Donny Most grinning with almost no teeth Rick smiles
in an ironic and defeated way

RICK
I know
(uneasy beat)
I think

ANGLE BEHIND CAR ON WESTWOOD BLVD

THREE GUNSHOTS sound off the car swerving slightly As the car
passes through the next shop’s light we see only the driver
inside the car

ANGLE INSIDE DONNY’S CAR

Donny looks down at the passenger seat and smiles Donny lets
out a deep SIGH immensely relieved

ANGLE ON WESTWOOD BLVDSANTA MONICA BLVD INTERSECTION
The car rolls through Santa Monica Boulevard on a RED LIGHT --
A CITY BUS barrels down Santa Monica Blvd and blaring its
HORN completely FLATTENS DONNY’S CAR The side of the bus is a
huge AD for “HAPPY DAYS R HERE AGAIN” The new Ralph stands with
the cast holding his head with a comical surprised face SMOKE
pours out from under the bus

FADE TO BLACK
BACK TO THEATER
The audience stands up APPLAUDING The credits roll by
ANGLE ON AISLE

A BUXOM BLONDE in a breath-taking dress walks up and gestures to
someone -- everyone turns to

CHARLIE KAUFMAN

Smiling shyly People motion him to go He makes his way to the
aisle and is lead by the Buxom Blonde to the front

ANGLE ON FRONT

Charlie steps onto the stage and smiles The crowd goes wilder
He reluctantly takes a bow

INT PREMIERE THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

The roar of APPLAUSE abruptly goes MUFFLED as we see

A WIDE SHOT OF LOBBY

With no people in it looking ghostly and lonely Into frame a
PUSH BROOM eases forward sweeping trash on the floor followed
by the SWEEPER -- Rick in an USHER UNIFORM

The door behind the concession counter opens and Donny Most in
an USHER UNIFORM steps out with an armful of popcorn tubs He
kicks the door shut and sets the tubs on the counter

DONNY
Boy they’re going crazy in there
Must’ve been a good flick huh

RICK
Hm

Rick keeps sweeping We hear a MUFFLED VOICE in the background
obviously Charlie speaking into a microphone in the theater

DONNY
The boss says you’re doing great Rick

RICK
(lifeless)
Thanks for helping me get the job

DONNY
Hey it’s the least I could do after
shooting you and all Boy that’s all
behind me now
Rick stops and leans on his broom

RICK
You do seem a lot more mellow these days

Donny smiles enthusiastically
DONNY
Oh I feel fantastic I’m taking that new
Ron Howard pill

Donny nods a bit too joyously Rick eyes him cynical

RICK
I see

DONNY
Yeah works great -- but there are side
effects

RICK

(suspiciously)
Like what
Donny lifts his paper hat -- he’s BALDING terribly Donny
returns the hat then resumes his busy work

RICK (CONTD)
Bittersweet’s better than bitter

DONNY
(grins)
Hey that’s pretty good You should try
writing Maybe be another Charlie
Kaufman

Rick glares at Donny for a long beat then sweeps trash into a

dustpan Donny smiles as he stacks cups
DONNY (CONT’D)
I can’t wait to see this new one I love
all of Kaufman’s films Did you see his
last one
Rick empties the full dustpan into a trash can

RICK
I don’t really bother with things like
that anymore

Donny’s mouth drops open astonished
DONNY
Are you kidding You work in a theater
and you don’t go to movies

Rick resumes sweeping trash on the floor expressionless

RICK
What’s a movie

Rick and Donny look over as A BIG YELLOW BALLOON bounces
unrealistically across the lobby floor then out of frame
Rick drops his broom -- he and Donny race after the balloon

FADE OUT

THE END
