From the fog a ship appears crashing through the waves)

Aquata Andrina Arista Atina Adella Allana

And then there is the youngest in her musical debut

Our seventh little sister were presenting her to you

To sing a song Sebastian wrote her voice is like a bell

his
telescope)

Ariel Scuttle

Scuttle (Looking through the telescope the wrong way shouting)

Whoa

telescope to
reveal Ariel at wings length) Whoa what a swim

Ariel Scuttle - look what we found

Flounder Yeah - we were in this sunken ship - it was really creepy

Scuttle Human stuff huh Hey lemme see (Picks up fork) Look at

Wow - this is special - this is very very unusual

Ariel What What is it

Scuttle Its a dinglehopper Humans use these little babies to
straighten their hair out See - just a little twirl here an a yank
there and - voiolay You got an aesthetically pleasing

configuration
of hair that humans go nuts over

Ariel A dinglehopper

Flounder What about that one

Scuttle (Holding pipe) Ah - this I havent seen in years This is

wonderful

A banded bulbous - snarfblat

Ariel and Flounder Oohhh

Scuttle Now the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times when

humans used
to sit around and stare at each other all day Got very boring

So they
invented the snarfblat to make fine music Allow me

(Scuttle blows into the pipe seaweed pops out the other end)
Ariel Music Oh the concert Oh my gosh my fathers gonna kill me
Flounder The concert was today

Scuttle (Still contemplating pipe) Maybe you could make a little
planter

out of it or somethin

Ariel Uh Im sorry Ive gotta go Thank you Scuttle (Waves)
Scuttle Anytime sweetie anytime

(Cut to Flotsam and Jetsam then Ursula in background watching
magic
projection of Ariel swimming)

Ursula Yeeeeeees hurry home princess We wouldnt want to miss old
daddys

celebration now would we Huh Celebration indeed Bah In MY
day we

had fantastical feasts when I lived in the palace And now look at
me â€”

wasted away to practically nothing - banished and exiled and
practically

starving while he and his flimsy fish-folk celebrate Well Ill
give em

something to celebrate soon enough Flotsam Jetsam I want you
to keep an

extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his She may be
the key

to Tritons undoing

(Fade to the palace throne room where Ariel is being admonished)

Triton I just dont know what were going to do with you young lady
Ariel Daddy Im sorry I just forgot I -
Triton As a result of your careless behaviour -
Sebastian Careless and reckless behaviour
Triton - the entire celebration was er -
Sebastian Well it was ruined Thats all Completely destroyed
This

concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career Now
thanks to

you I am the laughing stock of the entire kingdom
Flounder But it wasnt her fault Ah - well - first ahh this shark
chased us

- yeah - yeah And we tried to - but we couldnt - and - grrrrrrrrr
- and -

and we - whoooaaaaaa - oh and then we were safe But then this
seagull came

and it was this is this and that is that and -
Triton Seagull What Oh - you went up to the surface again didnt
you

DIDNT YOU
Ariel Nothing - happened
Triton Oh Ariel How many times must we go through this You

seen by one of those barbarians - by - by one of those humans
Ariel Daddy theyre not barbarians
Triton Theyre dangerous Do you think I want to see my youngest
daughter
snared by some fish-eaters hook
Ariel Im sixteen years old - Im not a child anymore -
Triton Dont you take that tone of voice with me young lady As long
as you
live under my ocean youll obey my rules
Ariel But if you would just listen -
Triton Not another word - and I am never NEVER to hear of you going
to the

surface again Is that clear (Ariel leaves crying)
Sebastian Hm Teenagers They think they know everything You
give

them an inch they swim all over you
Triton Do you er think I - I was too hard on her
Sebastian Definitely not Why if Ariel was my daughter Id show
her who was

boss None of this flitting to the surface and other such
nonsense No

sir - Id keep her under tight control
Triton Youre absolutely right Sebastian
Sebastian Of course
Triton Ariel needs constant supervision
Sebastian Constant
Triton Someone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble
Sebastian All the time -
Triton And YOU are just the crab to do it

(Cut to Sebastion walking down corridor)

Sebastian How do I get myself into these situations I should be
writing

symphonies - not tagging along after some headstrong teenager (Sees
Ariel

and Flounder sneaking off and follows) Hmm What is that girl up
to (He

barely makes it into cave and sees Ariels collection) Huh
Flounder Ariel are you okay
Ariel If only I could make him understand I just dont see things
the way he

does I dont see how a world that makes such wonderful things -
could be

bad

Look at this stuff
Isnt it neat
Wouldnt you think my collections complete
Wouldnt you think Im the girl

The girl who has evrything

Look at this trove

Treasures untold

How many wonders can one cavern hold
Lookin around here youd think

Legs are required for jumpin dancin
Strollin along down a

Up where they walk

Up where they run

Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin free

Wish I could be

Part of that world

What would I give

f I could live
Outta these waters
What would I pay

To spend a day
Warm on the sand
Betcha on land
They understand

Bet they dont reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick o swimmin
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask em my questions

And get some answers

Whats a fire and why does it

(Whats the word) burn
Whens it my turn

Wouldnt I love

Love to explore that shore above
Out of the sea

Wish I could be

Part of that world

against Erics
foot) Oh I - I cant make out a heartbeat
Ariel No look Hes breathing Hes so beautiful

What would I give
To live where you are
What would I pay
To stay here beside you
What would I do to see you
Smiling at me

Where would we walk

Where would we run

If we could stay all day in the sun
Just you and me

And I could be

Part of your world

(Sebastion and Flounder have washed up and are watching scene Max

Sebastian Down HERE is your home Ariel - listen to me The human
world -
its a mess Life under the sea is better than anything they got up
there

The seaweed is always greener

In somebody elses lake

You dream about going up there

But that is a big mistake

Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor

Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin for

Under the sea

Under the sea

Darling its better

Down where its wetter

Take it from me

Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin

Full time to floatin

Under the sea

Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land aint happy
They sad cause they in their bowl

But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate

One day when the boss get hungry
Guess whos gon be on the plate

Under the sea

Under the sea

Nobody beat us

Fry us and eat us

In fricassee

Under the sea we off the hook

We got no troubles

Life is the bubbles

Under the sea

Under the sea

Since life is sweet here

We got the beat here

They get the urge n start to play
We got the spirit

Jetsam flicks the statues broken face towards Ariel

Ariel Looking at the face Wait

(Cut to outside of cave with Flounder and Sebastion)

Flounder (snif) Poor Ariel

Sebastian Ariel no No shes a demon shes a monster
Ariel Why dont you go tell my father Youre good at that
Sebastion But But I (To Flounder) Come on (They travel
towards

Ursulas cavern)
Flotsam and Jetsam This way (Ariel enters and is hung up in the
garden of

souls)
Ursula Come in Come in my child We mustnt lurk in doorways -
its rude

One MIGHT question your upbringing Now then Youre here
because

you have a thing for this human This er prince fellow Not that
I blame

you â€”- he is quite a catch isnt he Well angel fish the solution
to your

problem is simple The only way to get what you want - is to become
a human

yourself
Ariel Can you DO that
Ursula My dear sweet child Thats what I do - its what I live for
To help

unfortunate merfolk - like yourself Poor souls with no one else to
turn to

I admit that in the past Ive been a nasty

They werent kidding when they called me well a witch
But youll find that nowadays

Ive mended all my ways

Repented seen the light and made a switch

True Yes

And I fortunately know a little magic
Its a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately please dont laugh
use it on behalf

Of the miserable lonely and depressed
(Pathetic)

Poor unfortunate souls

n pain

n need

This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them

Yes indeed

Those poor unfortunate souls

So sad

So true

They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying Spells Ursula please
And I help them

Yes I do

fq

Now its happened once or twice

Someone couldnt pay the price

And Im afraid I had to rake em cross the coals
Yes Ive had the odd complaint

But on the whole Ive been a saint

To those poor unfortunate souls

Now heres the deal I will make you a potion that will turn you
into

a human for three days Got that Three days Now listen this is
import-â€”

ant Before the sun sets on the third day youve got to get dear
ol

princey to fall in love with you That is hes got to kiss you
Not just

any kiss - the kiss of true love If he does kiss you before the
sun sets on

the third day youll remain human permanently but - if he
doesnt you

turn back into a mermaid and - you belong to me
Sebastion No Ariel (He is silenced by Flotsam and Jetsam)
Ursula Have we got a deal
Ariel If I become human Ill never be with my father or sisters
again
Ursula Thats right But - youll have your man Lifes full
of tough

choices innit Oh - and there is one more thing We havent
discussed the

subject of payment You cant get something for nothing you know
Ariel But I dont have any -
Ursula Im not asking much Just a token really a trifle Youll
never even

miss it What I want from you is your voice
Ariel My voice
Ursula Youve got it sweetcakes No more talking singing zip
Ariel But without my voice how can I -
Ursula Youll have your looks Your pretty face And dont
underestimate the

importance of body language Ha

The men up there dont like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore

Yes on land its much preferred

For ladies not to say a word

And after all dear what is idle prattle for

Come on theyre not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can

But they dote and swoon and fawn

On a lady whos withdrawn

Its she who holds her tongue who gets her man

Come on you poor unfortunate soul

Go ahead

Make your choice

m a very busy woman

And I havent got all day

t wont cost much

Just your voice

You poor unfortunate soul

ts sad

But true

f you want to cross a bridge my sweet
Youve got to pay the toll

Take a gulp and take a breath

And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam Jetsam now Ive got her boys
The boss is on a roll

This poor unfortunate soul

(Ariel signs contract)
Paluga sarruga come winds of the Caspian Sea
Now rings us glossitis and max laryngitis

give it to
Ursula She laughs as Ariel is changed into a human and rushed to

Grimsby (Wiping his face) Oh very amusing Carlotta my dear
whats for

dinner
Carlotta Oooh youre gonna love it Chefs been fixing his
specialty

stuffed crab

(Cut to Sebastion watching Louis cook He is humming to himself)

Louis

Les poissons

Les poissons

How I love les poissons
Love to chop

And to serve little fish
First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out the bones
Ah mais oui

Ca cest toujours delish
Les poissons

Les poissons

Hee hee hee

Hah hah hah

With the cleaver I hack them in two
pull out whats inside
And I serve it up fried

God I love little fishes
Dont you

Heres something for tempting the palate
Prepared in the classic technique

First you pound the fish flat with a mallet
Then you slash through the skin

Give the belly a slice

Then you rub some salt in

Cause that makes it taste nice
Zut alors I have missed one

Sacre bleu

What is this

How on earth could I miss

Such a sweet little succulent crab
Quel dommage

What a loss

Here we go in the sauce

Now some flour I think

Just a dab

Now I stuff you with bread

It dont hurt cause youre dead
And youre certainly lucky you are
Cause its gonna be hot

In my big silver pot

Toodle loo mon poisson

Au revoir

(Sebastion hops back and Louis grabs him again) What is this
(Sebastion

pinches his nose and a battle ensues Louis knocks over a large
cabinet)

(Cut to dining room Huge crash is heard)
Carlotta I think Id better go see what Louis is up to
(Back to kitchen Louis is trashing the place)

Louis Come out you little pipsqueak and fight like a man
Carlotta Louis What are you doing
Louis Well - I - I was just - er er Im sorry madame

for

Sebastian to hide there Sebastian rushes across while no one is
looking)

stimulation Stand back (He flies over and sings very badly)
