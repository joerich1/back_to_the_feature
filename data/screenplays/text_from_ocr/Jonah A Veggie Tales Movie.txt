the engine of a minivan

ROAD

The road and surrounding woods are very dark -

camera revealing the darkened woods once again

Much chaos

Van out of control We hear more yelling guitar
boinging etc In the foreground a family of
porcupines - a momma and 2 kids are crossing the
road The van is headed right at them We cut to
the momma porcupines reaction Shes shocked and
terrified She looks to her babies Cute
innocent and unaware of the danger they look back
at her with kinked heads and blink Momma
porcupine looks tenderly at her babies then turns
angrily toward the approaching van Dramatically
she winds-up

INTERIOR - NIGHT VEGGIE VAN

We cut back to Bob as the map falls below his
eyes He reacts in terror to what he then sees
Momma porcupine has her quilled back toward the
van with her head turned - looking right at him
The babies stand innocently and blink

BOB
PORCUPINE

EXTERIOR - NIGHT WINDING RURAL ROAD

Momma porcupine then pitches a swarm of quills
at the front tires We follow the flight of the
quills on the quill cam as they punch into the
tires We hear a couple of explosions from the
tires popping

ALL
AAAHH

EXTERIOR - NIGHT WINDING RURAL ROAD

The van performs some donuts as it continues
forward Much screams Bob spins the wheel
wildly trying to regain control of the van The
porcupines watch in interest as the screaming
van spins off the side of the road and heads down
a steep wooded hill that
steers wildly as the van

Poing Poing Poing The last 3 cords snap in
rapid succession and the van lurches toward the
river The kids eyes widen and they all press
back against their seats in unison and everyone
screams like mad

ALL

EXT HILL -NIGHT

As the van rolls perilously toward the river a
low-angle shot reveals a thick tree stump in its
path about bumper-height unnoticed by the vans
occupants As they scream and roll ahead
suddenly the bumper meets the tree stump and the
van stops cold no more than 6 feet from the river

INTERIOR VAN - NIGHT

The tree stump stops the van cold but also fires
both front seat airbags which inflate and
completely engulf Bob and Dads faces The
screaming dies out Silence The kids are afraid
to blink The airbags remain completely inflated
engulfing Bob and Dad who stare into them
motionless wondering if they are dead After a
pause and not quite sure what has happened Bob
speaks

BOB
(sfx - talking
in balloon)
Am I in heaven

Beat There is dust in the air from the airbags
DAD

(sniffs)
Smells like Wisconsin
The kids finally let their breath out and fall
back into their seats

KIDS
(exhale sigh)
Phew

EXT RIVERSIDE -NIGHT

LS of the van at the bank of the river After a
pause the sliding passenger side door opens and
we see the veggie kids and dad peeking out into
the moonlit night Dust is settling Bob pops
through the crowd looks around and exits the
van He looks around a little more

BOB
Well Nobody got hurt

We hear the flying quill SFX and a doink

BOB (contd)
AAAAHHHH

BOB looks over his shoulder to find a small
quill stuck in his behind We hear high pitched
laughing Dad looks back up the hill and sees the
three porcupines standing where the van left the
road This time one of the babies has his back to
Bob - as if he were the one responsible for the
shot His mother and sibling are laughing
approvingly

DAD
Wow What a shot

BOB
(in pain)
Hrrrgrrr
JR

Hey Whats that

Everyone directs their attention to that which Jr
has observed Its an old rundown shack under a
bridge along the bank of the river The lights
from the building glow eerily dimly illuminating
the surrounding landscape A Red Neon sign
reading SEAFOO buzzes There is a dock attached
to the restaurant to which are tied a couple
decrepid rowboats and a larger pirate type ship
(see The Pirates that Dont do Anythings

ship) A fog rises from the river which overflows
onto the land A FOG HORN sounds and a SHIP BELL
rings An occasional SEAGULL call fills the

air Eerie Cut back to our groups reaction
ALL
(except BOB )
Oooooh

ANNIE

- Only saltier

Cut back to the restaurant A D on the end of

word SEAFOOD

We hear Jr teasing Laura and Bob scolding Dad as
our group comes through the front door of the
seafood restaurant Its set up like a typical
Red Lobster with a hostess station and waiting
area in the lobby bathrooms and telephones off to
the side and a dining room beyond a clam and
lobster montage arch Jean Claude and Phillipe Pea
are the hosts and are standing on the host

podium The walls are filled with every
imaginable sea creature - both stuffed and
painted Fishing nets hang A picture of Ahab
and Moby Dick adorns the walls as well The
atmosphere is very mysterious and salty The
Pirates Who Dont Do Anythings theme in a
moodynautical style is playing over the audio
system Dialogue is occurring simultaneously

PHILLIPE stops hopping and stands there examining
the quill as JEAN CLAUDE continues with the other

PHILLIPE hops back toward the kitchen revealing
(rack focus) three scraggly pirates ina

booth Its The Pirates Who Dont Do Anything
Pa Grape Mr Lunt and Larry They join into the
intercom music lazily singing like old high school
football players reminiscing about their glory
days

PIRATES

(Singing)
We are The Pirates Who

just stay home and lie
around And if
you ask us to do
anything
Well just tell

Cut back to JEAN CLAUDE BOB JR and LAURA as they
reach their booth Coincidently it is right
beside where the pirates are sitting The booths
are divided by a sheet of translucent

Plexiglas We hear the light lazy banter of the
pirates (having finished their little chorus)
beyond the glass as background noise

JEAN CLAUDE
Please make yourselves
comfortable I will be
back to take your
orders

JEAN CLAUDE places menus on table and hops away

BOB

hopping off Jr smiles self-righteously

LAURA
(frustrated
noise)

PIRATES

LAURA hops off after BOB JR remains at the
table gloating in the divine justice of Lauras
plight He looks around the restaurant taking in
the surroundings - which are slightly eerie once
again He can see the silhouettes of the pirates
through the Plexiglas They continue their
banter He realizes he is alone and feels a
little frightened

We return to JR at the table He nervously looks
around then spots the menu in front of him He
opens it up and starts to read We scan it as he
reads

STEAK AND SHRIMP 1000

eyebrow We hear a SLIDING SFX

(VO)
Beside the fact that we

Larry and others turn to look at a tall figure
entering the market It is JONAH (Archibald

Asparagus)

riding very regally on

his CAMEL REGINALD As Pa speaks we watch Jonah

ride into the market as well as the reactions of
the crowd to the presence of a prophet

Theme 2B-271)

PA

NARRATOR (cont

d)
Jonah
(musical sting)

Now Jonah was a prophet of

God - which means he was
one of the very special

people God used to deliver

messages to Israel He
was kind of like a
mailman
except his letters
came straight from God
(Pa gets a
little too
excited on
that line)

(SCORE
Ahem Anyway Jonah
loved helping his friends
by bringing them Gods
messages Sometimes the
messages were good
sometimes they were not so
good But when a prophet

talked everybody listened

NEZZER
(yelling out)
Whats the word Jonah

TOWNS PEOPLE
(various)
(Whats the word Yeah

Jonah looks around smartly then pulls up his
camel

JONAH

demeanor it is obvious that he too is

speaks Music starts

Crowd strikes a final pose - holds it for a few
beats - then everyone goes back to their business

JONAH
Alright good show
everyone Thank you very
much

PA NARRATOR
(VO)
That was pretty much
Jonahs life Town to
town bringing Gods
messages to his friends
not a bad gig overall

DISSOLVE TO
EXT - NIGHT OUTSIDE JONAHS TENT

Small colorful tent set up on the edge of

town (Big enough to stand up in but wouldnt
hold more than 3 or 4 people) Oil lamp is
primary source of light hanging near tents small
window

DISSOLVE TO
INT - NIGHT INSIDE JONAHS TENT

Jonah is ready for bed praying Either seated or
standing depending on acting logistics There is
a map of Israel on the wall painted on a large
piece of papyrus The map extends just enough to
show Nineveh in the far upper right corner

PA NARRATOR
So every night before he
went to sleep Jonah would
pray and ask God if there
was a new message for him
to deliver And this
night there was a message
that would change Jonahs
life

JONAH
(eyes closed -
conversing
with God)
A new message yes
whats that People being
unkind Lying Stealing
Oh dear Sounds like a
standard turn and repent
to me Alright name the
town Ill be on my way
first thing in the
morning Where is
it Jericho Damascus
(pause)
What Nineveh

Jonah opens his eyes and scans his map

JONAH (contd)

(confused)
Im not aware of any
Ninevehs in Israel no
I dont think

(pause - eyes

widen)
Oh you
mean that Nineveh

PA NARRATOR

(Pan and zoom

across map to

Nineveh)
That Nineveh wasnt in
Israel at all It was the
capital of Assyria and it
was the biggest meanest
city around

(Show dark

scary city)
Now the people of Nineveh
were particularly mean to
Jonahs people - the
Israelites They
lied They stole But
worst of all they slapped
people with fishes

(Show Ninevites

doing the

above to

several

Israelites)

NINEVITE PEA
Yes

PA NARRATOR
They even slapped each
other with fishes They
didnt know the difference
between right and
wrong The Ninevites were
so mean in fact that
most Israelites -
including Jonah - wished
God would just wipe
Nineveh off the face of
the Earth

(Show fire from

heaven

consuming

Nineveh -

comically)

NINEVITE PEA
(yelling)

PA NARRATOR
Needless to say Jonah
was shocked that God would
want him to deliver a
message to his enemies

Back to Jonah

JONAH
(confused)
You - you dont want me to
go there You dont

know what Nineveh is
like Perhaps youve
never been there Well
of course you havent A
god like you would never
go to a place like
Nineveh For that matter
either would a prophet
like me Ha ha

(nervous laugh

- then singing

)
No it cannot be
Your messages are meant
for me and my
brothers
We are youre chosen
people - and Nineveh
well theyre not

There must be some mistake
- a big misunderstanding
Its really hard to take -
how could you be so
demanding
For years Ive been your
messenger from Moresheth
to Gath

But Nineveh should get no
chance to turn - theyve
earned your wrath

No it cannot be
Your messages are meant
for me and my
brothers

We are youre chosen
people - and Nineveh
well theyre not

(speaking)
Were the good guys
theyre the bad
guys Please dont send
me there with a message of
your mercy

(singing)
Damascus or Jerusalem
- Ill be there ina
minute
Any town in Israel just
ask me Ill be in it

Shiloh Gilgal Jericho

- just say the word

But Nineveh - that is just

absurd

Joppa Aphek Jezreel -

theyre all just fine -

But Nineveh
(thoughtful)

oh Nineveh
(resolute)

No Nineveh is where I

draw the line

Jonah rips off section of map containing Nineveh

on closing beat

EXT - NIGHT

cutting a clear line across map

CUT TO

JONAHS TENT NEAR GROUND ANGLE

Glow in tent window is the only warm tone in an

otherwise blue night scene
awake in town

Jonah flings the crumpled up piece
It bounces up near the

CUT TO
INT - JONAHS TENT

Jonah lies back on his mat staring up
thoughtfully

JONAH

He turns away from the camera and the WIND picks
up blowing out his small OIL LAMP

CUT TO BLACK
INT - NIGHT SEAFOOD RESTAURANT

Besides Junior a few more people have gathered
around to hear the story Laura included They
are entranced

Laura is now sitting beside Junior listening

PA GRAPE
Yup It sounded like God
wanted to offer mercy to
Jonahs enemies

Bob returns Sliding into the booth oblivious to
the story

BOB
The tow trucks on its
way Ya know Junior I
love your dad and all but
thats the last time I
pick him for a copilot

Bob notices the pirates staring

BOB (contd)
Uh whats going on

Lunt slurps on his straw Pa stares at him for a
beat

PA GRAPE
Ahem Were telling a
little story You should
listen too

Bob glances around then nods and smiles feebly
PA

GRAPE (contd)
As I was saying it
sounded like God wanted to
offer mercy to the
Ninevites

LAURA
Whats mercy

LUNT
Its what this whole story
is about

JUNIOR
I thought it was about
compassion
remember The menu

Mr Lunt looks a little embarrassed

LUNT
Uh yeah Theres that
too

PA GRAPE

Better check your menu
again - we got TWO
specials today and they
go hand in hand

Junior picks up his menu just in time to see
MERCY MARKET PRICE fade in right beneath
compassion

LARRY
Compassion is when you
want to help someone who
needs help Mercy is when
you give someone a second
chance even if they
dont deserve it This
story is about both of
them

PA GRAPE
Thats right my cucumber
friend Ya cant have
mercy without
compassion but mercy is
even more important Jona
h was afraid God was going
to give Nineveh a second
chance - that he was going
to help them even though
they didnt deserve it

EXT - DAY

Jonah backs
him No so

Jonah start

Jonah hurries off

townsperson

Jonah starts to run

confused

LAURA

OUTSIDE JONAHS TENT

PA NARRATOR

Jonah runs face first into giant map of middle

east posted next to a merchants booth

advertising cruise tickets

EXT - DAY

The merchant is SCOOTER
right at the edge of the dock
for cruises out of this small port
several ships docked behind him

DOCKSIDE

Jonah is interrupted by passing townspeople

SCOOTER

(looks to map)
Whats the furthest thing
in the world from Nineveh

SCOOTER
Well if you have a few
days you could sail down
to Egypt its lovely
this time of year

Something on the map has caught Jonahs eye He
isnt listening

JONAH
There I want to go
there

Camera follows Jonahs gaze to the far end of the
map - to an area called Tarshish

SCOOTER
Wha- Tarshish Why
that would take
weeks Its the other end
of the world

JONAH
Perfect How much

SCOOTER
Even if you had the money
no one around here has the
time to sail all the way
to Tarshish
Scooter notices one of the Pirates lounging above
deck in a recliner listening to their theme song
on a cheap AM radio

SCOOTER (cont
d)
Then again

Jonah notices Pirates as well
CUT TO
EXT - DAY PIRATE SHIP - ABOVE DECK

All 3 Pirates are lined up explaining why they
cant possibly sail to Tarshish

PA GRAPE
(overlapping)
We couldnt possibly
were very busy with
cargo and stuff

LUNT
You know Pirates have to
pillage and plunder and
uh that really takes it
out of you

LARRY
- and Alf is on ina
half-hour so I dont think
we should uh

PA GRAPE
and besides that we
dont really sail
(beat)
At all
(beat)
So the answer is no

JONAH
(after a pause)
Money is no object

Pregnant pause The Pirates are motionless Then
Pa Grape breaks the silence

PA GRAPE
Next stop Tarshish Tll
hoist the mainsail

LARRY
Ill pop the popcorn
LUNT
Ill get the moist
towelettes Where did we
put them Hey Larry have
you seen the towelettes

LARRY
I got it I got it

LUNT
No those are baby wipes
Theyll dry your skin out

Pirates scurry around like crazy imagining all
the cheese curls their newfound wealth will

buy Jonah smiles - relieved - but then looks a
bit concerned as he realizes he is now
officially running away from God

The Pirates prattle on as their ship moves away
from the dock under full sail Sailing
erratically they careen into the ship next to
them as they head toward the open sea

PA GRAPE (OS)
Sorry My fault

PA NARRATOR
Even though wed never
sailed before we took to
it like a fish to water

Cut to Larry standing dramatically in the crows
nest spyglass to his eye He scans the sea
aggressively He spots something

LARRY
Thar she blows

Cut to Lunt staring up at him from the deck

LUNT
Where

LARRY
(looking down
at the deck)
Right there Next to the
grill

We cut to Larrys POV through the telescope to
show a ping-pong ball on the deck of the ship next
to the BBO grill Lunt moves into shot Cut to
Lunt on deck

LUNT
Got it

Lunt takes the ball to the pint pong table Pa is
standing on the top of one side of the table with
paddle Jonah stands behind the opposite side
holding paddle lethargically

PA GRAPE
6-0

Pa serves the ball It bounces right past Jonah
who makes no attempt to hit it Hes too depressed
to try He watches it bounce off the table and
over toward the grill

PA

GRAPE (contd)
7-0 Thats a skunk I

Jonah looks on dryly Lunt and Larry cheer

LUNT AND LARRY

PA GRAPE

(cheering in

unison)
We winny at the ping pong
We get the ho-ho and the
ding dong
Ding-dong

Cut to shot from the bulkhead ad Jonah listlessly
walks toward stairs to go below deck

PA NARRATOR
Once we finally got out to
sea Jonah went below deck
to rest a bit
CUT TO
INT - DAY SHIPS HOLD

Typical ships hold Dark and musty Bags of
grape leaves on floor barrels of who-knows-what
etc Two bunks hang off one wall - one over the
other Light comes from several oil lanterns
plus some natural light down ladder from above
deck and through cracks in planking above Jonah
enters and looks around

JONAH
(a little
depressed)
Oh what have I
done What have I done

Jonah grabs bag of grape leaves and tosses it on
bunk to use as a pillow He drops onto the bunk
on his back with his head on the bag unaware
that there is a large worm in the bag he has
chosen

TAPE
(from bag)
You are powerful and
attractive

JONAH
(glances around
nervously)
What Whos there

TAPE
You do not run from your
problems but confront
them face-to-face

JONAH
(jumping up)
Ah The bag It speaks

Throws bag against opposite wall

KHALIL
(from pillow)
Ow What did you do that
for

JONAH
Mr Twisty Whos

Worm crawls up on barrel or something He is
holding headphones which he places back in the
bag of leaves Jonah has never seen a worm exactly
like this one

KHALIL

KHALIL

KHALIL

(proudly)
I am a small business
operator A traveling
salesman I sell Persian
rugs door to door See

JONAH

interested)
Oh - lovely A-

Jonah opens his mouth to speak but Khalil cuts
him off

KHALIL
By the way do you know
where this ship is going
JONAH
Yes Tarshish

KHALIL

(eyes widen)
Tarshish What a trip

(thinks)
You know that may be just
what I need The Persian
rug business has not been
going very well around
here

(brightens)
But I still have a
positive mental
attitude because of my
motivational tapes

Pulls headphones out of bag of leaves - tape is
still playing Jonah looks on curiously

TAPE
You are a skilled
metalworker

Khalil smiles big

KHALIL
I am a skilled
metalworker
(shrugs)

I did not know that

Jonah stares perplexed Khalil puts headphones
back in back - clicks off tape Jonah turns to
straighten his bunk

JONAH

Yes well thats
lovely Carlyle but if
you dont mind I think
Ill just get some rest

Khalil is staring intently at Jonahs profile It
looks very familiar Suddenly he realizes who
hes looking at

KHALIL
(excited)
Jonah
Jonah startles
JONAH

Huh -
KHALIL

JONAH

KHALIL

Pulls out Persian rug with Jonahs profile on it

KHALIL

Khalil gives the Jonah doll a few whacks to the
belly

PLUSH TOY
(tinny - sound

From town to town -

JONAH
(still hiding a
smile)
Oh no its really
KHALIL

(not slowing

down a bit)
The man God can count on
to deliver his messages

This line nicks Jonah and his fake modesty starts
to fade

JONAH
(deflating)
Yes well

KHALIL
You and God are like peas
in a pod Like two humps
on a camel - you always
sway the same way

Jonah is wilting

KHALIL
(CONTD)
(laughing)
Oh thats a good
one You know humor runs
very deep in my
family My uncle was a
big star back at a comedy
club in Nineveh the Taj

Then he was hit with a
fish Im telling you

KHALIL

Oh yes There is a woman

asparagus She is waiting
there for you no

JONAH

KHALIL

(keeps right on

going)
You were promised to be

now in the way The
womans father is the head
of an international ring
of camel thieves This
very day you set sail for
Tarshish to deliver a
message that will break
the back of the camel
thieves - but in the
process will break the
heart of the woman you
love

Jonah stares - unable to speak

KHALIL
(CONTD)
Insight runs very deep in
my family Do not worry
the first one is free

JONAH
(beyond
desperate)
Please Carlyle I just
need to get some rest

KHALIL
Its Khalil But you can
call me Carlyle if you
want to When we get to
Tarshish you can deliver

a team

Jonah stares at the wall and groans

TOY
A message from the
Lord

JONAH
Ugh

KHALIL

Well sweet dreams
travelling buddy We can
make our plans to save
those camels tomorrow

Clearly depressed Jonah closes his eyes We hear
the click of Khalils tape recorder as the
motivational tape starts back up The look on
Jonahs face contrasts with the line from the
tape

TAPE
You are a go-getter

FADE TO BLACK

Suddenly running becomes difficult Jonah looks
down and sees that he is now running in water and
the water seems to be rising
JONAH (OS)

(struggling)
I cant hear you
PA GRAPE

Jonah

Water splashes Jonahs face as he tries vainly to
run against the rising tide

DISSOLVE TO

Dream transition back to Jonah tossing in his
bunk The hold of the ship is flooding and water
is splashing Jonahs face Pa Grape is trying to
wake him

PA GRAPE
Jonah Jonah Jonah

JONAH
(eyes closed)
No I- I cant hear you

PA GRAPE
Come on wake up We got

Jonah finally opens his eyes and sees his
surroundings Water sloshes around the hold as
the ship is rocked by an IMMENSE STORM

JONAH
(groggy)
What
(notices
situation)
Whats happening

PA GRAPE
Were in a storm Like
Ive never seen
before If we dont do
something quick were
gonna sink

We cut to the WORM with his mouth stuffed with
grape leafs bobbing around in a small pot while

munching away and licking his fingers

KHALIL
(speaking with

his mouth

full)
We seem to have sprung a
leak traveling buddy

PA GRAPE spots the worm and becomes angry

PA GRAPE
Huh Hey What are you

The WORM looks nervous
PA

GRAPE (contd)
Didnt I tell you to get
off my ship ya lousy leaf
eater

The WORM nods timidly in affirmation

KHALIL
Well yes but you see
my new friend and I are
going to Tarshish to break
the back of the camel
thieves

Pa glances curiously at Jonah who gives him an
its a long story look

KHALIL

(CONTD)
Crime-fighting runs very
deep in my family

PA GRAPE
Why if it wasnt for

this storm Id make ya

(turning his

attention to

Jonah)
And you How can you sleep

JONAH and the WORM startle

JONAH
(panic)
Well - what can we do

PA GRAPE
Get up and pray to your
god Maybe hell have
mercy on us and spare our
lives Oy

PA GRAPE turns to go above deck

PA

GRAPE (contd)
Somebody up there must
be really upset with
somebody down here

JONAH looks nervous the WORM looks at JONAH PA
GRAPE then turns back and brightens just having
had a realization

PA

GRAPE (contd)
Wait a minute Thats
it Alright you two
follow me

The WORM and JONAH look curiously at each other

EXTERIOR - DAY PIRATE SHIP AT SEA

LARRY and MR LUNT are on deck at a small folding
table playing go fish with a deck of fish

cards MR LUNT has a big handful of

cards LARRY is holding only one card and has his
suits laid out neatly in front of him The ship
is rocking violently and the two pirates and their
table slide up and down the deck as they play

LUNT
You got electric eel

LARRY
Nope Go Fish
(tauntingly)
»one more card

MR LUNT
You are one cheatin

buccaneer

LARRY
Howm I supposed to cheat

MR LUNT thinks about the question

MR LUNT

PA GRAPE JONAH and the WORM approach

PA

GRAPE (contd)
Game over Shuffle em up

LARRY

MR LUNT
(Mockingly)
Hee Hee

The other three gather around the table MR LUNT
gathers the cards and shuffles them PA GRAPE
lays the ground rules We cut between
characters reactions as he speaks

PA GRAPE
Okay Heres the
deal The way I see it
there is a reason for this
storm Somebody up
there is really upset
with somebody down here
And its not gonna let up
until we know who that
somebody is It could
be any one of us

MR LUNT deals the cards
PA
GRAPE (contd)

I have my suspicions

PA GRAPE turns sharply toward the WORM who reacts
in terror

PA
GRAPE (contd)
But we wont know for sure
until we figure it out
scientifically

EVERYONE looks at each other suspiciously

PA

GRAPE (contd)
All right men -- Go
fish looser takes a

swim
LIGHTNING flashes EVERYONE startles

We montage through an intense game of go fish as
the storm continues to rage We dissolve between
different types of fish cards being flipped up
passed around and set down on the table We see
characters faces as the game progresses - if
theyre holding a lot of cards they look nervous
if not theyre relaxed MR LUNT appears to be
losing at one point then the game shifts and the
WORM is on the loosing end We cut away to a wide
shot of the pirate ship and see it being tossed
around by the waves The worm starts to make a
comeback We hear reverby go fishes and various
aarghs and uh-ohs throughout the game

Finally only the WORM and JONAH are left with
cards They both look very nervous MUSIC
stops The WORM asks timidly

KHALIL
»-You got any trout

JONAHS face drops He slides the WORM a

card The WORM picks the card up then slowly
lays down his last four cards face up - four
whales The WORM is out JONAH is the loser All
eyes turn toward JONAH PA GRAPE is confused

KHALIL
(CONTD)
Hmmm What a goose I am
Its a match I had it all

along

PA GRAPE
Huh I thought for
sure

JONAH

Alright I admit it Its
my fault All my fault
Im the one to blame

Khalil looks at Jonah confused
PA GRAPE

But I the worm
JONAH
(cutting PA
off)

IT am a Hebrew and I
worship the Lord the God
of heaven who made the
sea and the land And Im
running away from Him He
told me to go to Nineveh
but I didnt listen You
know I dont like those
people

MR LUNT
(chiming in)
Oooh Fish slappers

Cut back to Khalil shaking his head in disbelief

JONAH
Yes so I ran I ran
and I ended up here and
now everyones in terrible
danger all because of me
Im afraid the only thing
left is to be thrown into
the sea

LARRY
Awww you dont have to
do that we gotta
plank You can just walk
off

JONAH thinking himself noble for the offer is a
little surprised by LARRYS comment and comments
dryly

JONAH
Yes thank you
Youre too kind

LARRY smiles at the compliment

PA GRAPE
Well Jonah ol buddy It
was nice knowin ya
Normally youd be entitled
to a refund but under the
circumstances - you know
with you dyin and all
JONAH is again underwhelmed by his hosts
benevolence

JONAH

- No I
dont suppose
a refund would
do me much
good now
would it

PA GRAPE
Ah thanks Youre a
trooper
(to LARRY)

Aint he a trooper

LARRY nods and smiles in agreement JONAH looks

down and catches Khalils eye

KHALIL
But the camels

JONAH
(looks down)
Oh

Jonah shakes his head sadly then looks pitifully

toward the sea

Suddenly MR LUNT brightens up then chimes in

MR LUNT
Hey Wait a minute I just
remembered something
Maybe you dont have to
walk the plank after all

ALL
Huh

EXTERIOR - DAY REAR OF PIRATE SHIP AT SEA

Our friends have all gathered around a big lump

covered with a tarp at the back of the ship
storm continues to rage

MR LUNT
Every winter my cousin
from Moose Lake asks me to
take care of this

MR LUNT peels off the tarp revealing a large
powered outboard dual propeller boat motor

The

gas
ALL

Oooooh

LARRY
Cool

PA GRAPE
What is it

MR LUNT

This my friends is a
Jupiter 1600 horsepower
high-octane dual
propeller pull ignition

outboard motor with the
optional chrome trim
package

The chrome shimmers

ALL
(in the same
tone)
Oooooh

LARRY
(in the same
tone)
Cool

PA GRAPE
(in the same
tone)
What is it

MR LUNT
It gets us back to Joppa

PA GRAPE

Oh
JONAH

Well How does it work
MR LUNT

That I dont know

Everyone stands there and stares at the
engine The WORM then speaks up

KHALIL
Perhaps I could help
(to Jonah)

You know technical
competency runs -
JONAH
(interrupting)
I know very deep in your
family

The worm is surprised

KHALIL
Oh Our reputation
precedes us Well then
it appears that one should
pull the cord and then
perhaps push this black
bubbly thingy

Everyone thinks thats as good of an idea as any
other They all ignorantly nod in agreement The
WORM does just that He pulls the cord a couple
of times and the engine turns over but does not
start He then squeezes the fuel line bubble a
couple of times Nothing happens Everyone looks
at the WORM who becomes a little nervous that his
plan did not work He revises it

KHALIL
(CONTD)
Oh no Maybe its the
other way around Perhaps
if one first pushes the
black bubbly thingy
and then pulls the cord

Everyone again ignorantly nods The WORM squeezes
the fuel line bubble a couple of times then gives
the cord a firm pull The engine starts up
immediately The propellers start spinning

ALL
Aaah

The WORM proud of himself adds

KHALIL
See
ALL
(Yelling)
Ahhhhh

Just then the propellers catch the surface of the
deck of the ship Wood chips fly as the spinning
blades propel the engine all the way across the
deck - ripping a trail in the planks Cut to shots
of the propeller chasing characters through
screen They scream as the motor follows It then
crashes through the guard rail on the bow of the
ship and drops into the sea Everyone stares in
disbelief

MR LUNT
(after a pause)
Yep Thats how it works

Everyone turns angrily to the worm who is
standing there dumbfounded He notices the glares
and becomes frightened

KHALIL
It has been delightful
but I must go now

The WORM runs away from the group and dives into
an Art Bigotti bowling bag in the pirates pile of
leisure gear next to the card table We cut to CU
of JONAH who offers a resigned look as the camera
pushes in to his eyes- this is his fate He has
no other choice but to

EXTERIOR - DAY THE PLANK OF PIRATE SHIP AT SEA

We pull out of JONAHS face to reveal a different
background Hes now standing on the plank of
the ship and is wearing a little ducky flotation
ring and a swim cap The PIRATES stand at the
base of the plank with their heads bowed and their
eyes closed The storm continues to rage

PA GRAPE

(Praying)
Oh Lord dont let us die
for this mans sin And
dont hold us responsible
for his death because it
isnt our fault O Lord
you have sent this storm
upon him for your own good
reasons

LARRY
And keep my ducky safe

PIRATES
Amen

The PIRATES look up from their prayer to
JONAH He looks at them gulps then turns toward
the sea

JONAH
Gulp
We cut to the WORM poking his head out of the
bowling bag - he looks sad for his friend JONAH
bounces a few times then jumps off the plank and
splashes into the sea Immediately the winds
begin to die down and the sea starts to calm The
clouds part and sun shines once again Ina
matter of seconds the sea and air are completely
calm JONAH bobs up and down softly in his little
ducky ring He looks around The PIRATES a
little surprised that their plan actually worked
look over the side of the ship at JONAH

PA GRAPE
That was easy

EXTERIOR - DAY UNDERWATER
We cut to a below the water looking up at JONAH

shot We hear the PIRATES voices through the
water as OMINOUS JAWS-LIKE STRINGS sound

MR LUNT
Well Should we pull him
back in
BAAAA DUMMM
PA GRAPE

I dont see why not
BAAAA DUMMM
EXTERIOR - DAY PIRATE SHIP AT SEA

PIRATES looking at JONAH LARRY acquires a
lifesaver ring and tosses it out to JONAH He
misses by a mile

JONAH is not sure what to make of the situation
He thinks for a moment and then opens his mouth to
speak Before he can say anything something
brushes up against him causing him to turn a few
degrees STRINGS back in BAAAA DUMM JONAH looks
nervous The PIRATES look nervous STRINGS back in
full LARRY pulls the ring back in quickly and
throws it out again Not even close JONAH looks
over at the distant ring and gets pushed a few
feet through the water as the music intensifies
JONAH is getting very scared

JONAH
Something touched me
Theres something in the
water
PA GRAPE and MR LUNT yell frantically as
pulls the ring back in once again

Lunt throws

PA GRAPE
Hurry up Hurry

MR LUNT
Im hurrying

PA GRAPE
Hang on Jonah
(to Lunt)

Aim this time

LUNT
I was aiming

PA GRAPE
I can never tell where
youre looking

LUNT
You should talk

JONAH
Hurry

JONAH (CONTD)
Fellows please

PA GRAPE
Pull it back in Hurry

LUNT
Okay okay I got it

PA GRAPE

LUNT
No no Ill throw it

JONAH
Fellows Please

PA GRAPE
Comon Give it here

LUNT
I said I got it

LARRY

LARRY
Excuse me gentlemen
Perhaps I can be of some
assistance

LARRY tosses the ring This time its headed right
for JONAH Slow motion Very dramatic Very Bay
Watch The ring lands perfectly around JONAH -
just like the ring toss at the carnival LARRY
smiles - proud of his achievement MUSIC relaxes
slightly LARRY begins to pull JONAH in Just as
JONAH begins to move toward the boat - looking a
little more hopeful we see a GIANT WHALE come to
the surface behind JONAH and swallow him whole
The PIRATES expressions turn from relief to
shock LARRY reacts

LARRY (CONTD)
Oops

One of the Pirates notice that the life-ring rope
is sailing out very rapidly as the whale swims
away with the life-ring in its mouth They are
attached to the whale

PA GRAPE
Huh (Gasp)

The rope reaches its full length pulls taut and
then the metal cleat fastening it to the mast
breaks loose sailing toward the front of the
ship They are no longer attached to the whale

PIRATES
(all relieved)
sigh

Back to the cleat which sails towards the

bow It fails to clear the rail however and
instead wedges firmly against the front

rail Back to the Pirates whose faces fall as
they realize they are one again attached to the
whale

PIRATES (cont
d)
Hm

Before they can speak the boat jerks into
motion All three Pirates are knocked backwards
off their feet rolling head over heals all the
way across the deck to the wall of the poop deck

PIRATES (cont
d)
Aaaaaaahhh
The SHIP races through the water PA GRAPE gets up
and frantically looks around for a solution to the
problem

PA GRAPE
Man the cannon

MR LUNT
Aye aye capn

Larry and Pa run up to the cannon at the bow Mr
Lunt looks on concerned

MR LUNT
(standing)
We dont got no ammo

LARRY looks around and spots the pile of leisure
gear

LARRY
Oh yes we do

The ship races through the water
EXTERIOR - DAY CANNON OF PIRATE SHIP

Our brave buccaneer LARRY stuffs the cannon with
various leisure items and fire them off A TENNIS
RACKET

PA GRAPE
Fire one

MR LUNT pulls a string on the cannon The TENNIS
RACKET flies out spins wildly out of control and
splashes into the sea nowhere near the whale
LARRY then stuffs in two croquet mallets

PA
GRAPE (contd)
Fire Two

MR LUNT pulls the string on the cannon Same
result LARRY then spots the ammo jackpot - the
Art Bigotti bowling ball bag He removes the ball
and places in the cannon Just before the ball
sinks into the cannon the worm pops his head out
of the thumb-hole and says pathetically

KHALIL
Hello

The BALL drops in

PA GRAPE
Fire three

MR LUNT pulls the string The Ball comes roaring
out of the cannon We follow its flight as the
worm pops his head out of the thumb hole again and
screams in terror

KHALIL
AAAAAAAATIIIIIIm coming
traveling buddy

From the WORMS POV the camera flies to where the
WHALE had been - but now it is nowhere in sight
Presumably it has gone deep below the surface We
cut back to the WORM who looks confused He calls
out and whistles as if looking for a lost dog

KHALIL

(CONTD)
Traveling buddy
(whistle) Where are you

Suddenly the WHALE leaps out of the water
catching the bowling ball in his mouth like a dog
catching a treat Hanging in the air (ala Free
Willy) he holds it in it his mouth and we hear a
loud gulping noise With that the WHALE crashes
back into the sea releasing the life preserver as
he disappears

We see the life preserver pop out of the water As
it does the PIRATE SHIP slows - they are no
longer attached to the WHALE

100 ft off the bow of the ship The PIRATES stand
and look out in relief toward sea as the ship
comes to a stop Pause as they reflect Pa and
Mr Lunt remove their hats in respect

PA GRAPE
Now that boy really knows
how to go fish

The RUBBER DUCKY floatation ring pops out of the
water in the foreground Larry face lights

up He turns to the others who do not share his
joy Self-consciously he tries to match their
somber looks

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN

INT - WHALE
The scene is quite dark with JONAH forlornly
sitting on a BARREL or some other indigestible
object inside the whale After a moment

the BOWLING BALL rolls up next to him

JONAH
(dryly)
Oh look a bowling
ball If I could only
find some pins

The worm pops up out of the bowling ball like a
girl jumping out of a cake

KHALIL
You found better than
that travelling
buddy Its me

JONAH
(shudders as if
he suddenly
feels ill)
Oh my

KHALIL
So forget about
Tarshish All we need to
do is get this whale to
swim to Nineveh You give
the message - I sell the
plush toys - well be
right back on track

JONAH
(interrupting)
Carlyle please dont
speak to me Im having a
rather bad day

Jonah stands and walks away from worm depressed
and annoyed

KHALIL
Well you dont need to be
so down about it - Mr
Grumpy-pants

Jonah whirls back toward worm irate

JONAH
Look around you Were
inside a whale Were
going to be digested Do
you know what that
means
KHALIL
Of course I do Digestion
runs very deep in my
family Im just trying
to have a positive
outlook you know

(pause)

You know the difference
between you and me is that
you see the whale as half
empty but I see the whale
as half full

Jonah is dumbfound

JONAH
I dont know what that
means

KHALIL

(thinks for a
moment)
Neither do I

Worm looses energy - looks around Jonah turns
away and sits down forlornly

JONAH
Oh I might as well face
it God gave me a job to
do and I disobeyed him I
ran the other way Ive
done something terrible
and now Im getting what I

deserve sigh Im
going to die here in this
whale

The worm looks back at Jonah sympathetically -
opens his mouth to speak but realizes he has no
way to cheer up his travelling buddy VOICES are
heard from elsewhere in the whale

CUT TO
EXT - EVENING SURFACE OF SEA

SCOOTER and GEORGE are fishing with POLES from

a SMALL FISHING BOAT We can faintly hear

the MUSIC from the whale filtering up through the
water Scooter notices

Scooter looks puzzled then leans over the edge of
the boat and stares down into the water

CUT TO
EXT NIGHT UNDERWATER

As music continues we see the whale swimming
slowly away from the camera every-so-slightly
dancing to the music within him As whale
disappears into the darkness we transition back
to restaurant Song ends big over transition

WIPE TO
INT - NIGHT SEAFOOD RESTAURANT

All veggies are now present in booth and
listening with rapt attention

PA GRAPE
So from inside the whale
Jonah prayed and asked God
to forgive him for not
obeying He told God that
if he got another chance
he would go to Nineveh
even though he didnt like
those people very much

BOB
(now very
interested)
So did he get another
chance

PA GRAPE
(sly smile -
amused that
Bob is so
interested)
Shouldnt you be lookin
our for yer tow truck

BOB
(hurried)
Yeah yeah yeah That

another chance

PA GRAPE
Well God saw that Jonah
needed help and he wanted
to help him

JUNIOR
Thats compassion

BOB
But did he give him a
second chance even though
he didnt deserve it You
know mercy

PA GRAPE
After three days Jonah
noticed something strange
happening

DISSOLVE TO
INT - WHALE
Jonah and worm are sitting around inside
whale Suddenly the floor of the whale starts
undulating - and we here loud rumbling
sounds Jonah and worm are terrified as the

undulation becomes increasingly violent

-or-
This shot could be underwater exterior of whale -
showing whale reacting to his upset stomach No
interior needed

CUT TO
EXT DAY - SURFACE OF THE SEA

The sea is calm but we can faintly hear the
rumbling sound Suddenly there is a much louder
sound - somewhere between a massive burp anda
stomach rumble Jonah is launched from the sea
like a ballistic missile from a submarine - with
the worm hanging on desperately to Jonahs

bag They land in a heap on a sandy beach Jonah
looks pretty weird His skin is very pasty his
clothes are torn and he is wrapped in seaweed -
very Robinson Crusoe-ish

JONAH
(moan)

He moans a bit then rolls over and looks up -
right into the face of his camel Reginald

JONAH (CONTD)
(still on his

back)
Oh Reginald Good to
see you Yes well

DISSOLVE TO
EXT DAY - ROAD TO NINEVEH

Lawrence of Arabia shot endless desert Jonah
rides Reginald across barren countryside Clip
clop clip clop Worm is riding in Jonahs bag
peering out at the monotonous landscape which
grows more barren as they near Nineveh - as if the
cruelty of the Ninevites has disrupted nature

PA NARRATOR
So God told the whale to
burp up Jonah - and Jonah
got his second chance

DISSOLVE TO
Jonah and Khalil riding toward Nineveh
PA

NARRATOR (cont
d)
And just like he promised
he headed straight for

Nineveh
Jonah passes signs Welcome to Nineveh - Home
of the Mister Twistys Twisted Cheese Curls
Followed by Visitors Welcome To Leave

Jonah and Khalil look pretty nervous They enter
the canyon leading to Nineveh Jonah looks around
uncomfortably Then a noise ahead attracts his
attention A CRAZED MAN possibly from Joppa is

running right at him His eyes wide with terror
CRAZED MAN
(hysterical)

Turn back Turn back
Turn back

The man runs right by Jonah who turns to watch
eyes wide

CRAZED
MAN (contd)
The slapping

Whack He runs right into an outcrop on the canyon
wall Bounces back then keeps on going

CRAZED
MAN (contd)
The slapping

Jonah and Khalil stare after eyes wide We hear
the crazed mans voice trail off in the distance

CRAZED
MAN (contd)
Turn back Turn back

Jonah and Khalil look at each other clearly
frightened then turn ahead and nervously continue
their journey They continue a bit and then round
a corner Light from Nineveh fills Jonahs face
and he pulls up Reginald in awe of the sight he
sees Just ahead the canyon opens up and Nineveh
spreads out in front of him under a red hazy
sky The sound of ‘urban chatter and distant fish
slapping drifts up Swallowing hard Jonah urges
Reginald on (Maybe we should include a shot of
Reginald looking back at Jonah reluctantly)

Jonah approaches the gate of the great city and
two guards step out in from of him blocking his
path They are pea Ninevite guards with Cockney
accents (rapid-fire exchange as guards interrupt
Jonah)

JONAH
(to himself)
Go in give the message
get out
Go in give the message
get out

GUARD 1
Who goes ere

JONAH
Ah yes My name is
Jonah And Ima

GUARD 1

So whyre you ‘ere

JONAH
Well - I have a message

GUARD 1

JONAH
(thinking)
Well For everyone For

The guards find this ludicrous

GUARD 1

GUARD 2

GUARD 1
Oh thats rich

Guards start to laugh

GUARD 2

They laugh themselves silly Khalil pears around
Jonahs shoulder

KHALIL
I do not think this is
going very well

JONAH
Oh lets just go home I
did what you said I guess
it just wasnt meant to
be

Jonah turns Reginald to leave during this line
Just as he starts to trot away someone calls his
name

PA GRAPE
(OS)
Jonah

Jonah spins around to see the Pirates standing in
the entrance to the city apparently on their way
out They look rather silly as each wears what
appears to be a large foam cheese curl on their
head (similar to Wisconsins cheddar heads)

JONAH
(confused)
What
The Pirates step out of the gate
agape Jonah recognizes them

Reginald

KHALIL
(excited)
It is our friends from the
ship
JONAH
(recognizing
them)
What on earth What

are you doing here

LARRY
What are you doing here

LUNT
Ya You were you

PA GRAPE
fish food

with mouths
and slides off

The two parties meet off to the side of the gate
While they are talking Jonah periodically glances

up curiously at the Pirates headgear

Jonah pulls back
shoulder

KHALIL

The whale spit us out like
so much bad cous-cous and

here we are now

Delivering the message to

Nineveh

JONAH
But they wouldnt let us

in so I guess were going

home

LUNT
Hey I bet we could get
him in

JONAH
Huh

EXT NINEVEH GATE - MOMENTS LATER

not expecting this
Khalil smiles broadly

On his

CUT TO
CU on Guard 1 who snaps to attention as travelers
approach

Cut to his POV - the three pirates stand smiling
in front of him with Jonah behind them and Khalil
peering from is shoulder They look like theyre
posing for a family picture (Though Jonah doesnt
look like he wants to be part of the family)

Guard 1 softens as he recognizes the celebrities
GUARD 1
Hey look Its the cheese

curls blokes

The pirates smile

GUARD
1 (contd)
(sweetly)
Comin back for a visit

- hardens)
Ahem - is this fella with

(to Jonah)
Youre with them eh

JONAH
(trying to
smile)
Yes indeed Why I sailed
halfway across the world

with these fine
gentlemen
Has to force out those last few words His smile

fading like hes feeling suddenly ill

GUARD 1
(eyeing Jonah
suspiciously)
Alright You can come in
(pause as they
pass)
Enjoy your stay in
Nineveh

The group passes through the gate Jonah and
Khalil glance back nervously to see Guard 1
continue to make strange comically menacing
on you faces

JONAH
What was that all about
How did you do that

Pa snaps to excited to tell his story

PA GRAPE
Remember that money you
gave us
(suddenly
concerned)
By the way you arent
gonna want that refund

JONAH
(considers)
Ah
PA GRAPE
(relieved)

Good Cuz we spent it

Jonah stares

JONAH

LUNT
Yup 1458 bags of Mister
Twistys Twisted Cheese
Curls

LARRY
And youll never guess

hushed tone)
The golden ticket

Jonah doesnt get it

PA
GRAPE (contd)

We won the Mister
Twistys Twisted Cheese
Curl Sweepstakes

JONAH
And the prize was

Jonah glances back and forth at their hats Pa
looks up

PA GRAPE
(nods)

Mmm hmm But in addition
to our enviably
fashionable headgear we
also got a tour of Mister
Twistys factory - right
here in Nineveh

The group enters the crowded market area
Ninevites mill around Assorted fish slapping in
the background Jonah and Khalil arent wild about
what they see

PA

GRAPE (contd)
Which despite its
unseemly location was a
splendid experience

LARRY
And believe it or not
in this town we are
famous

LUNT
(noticing
something)
Hey look Here comes a
city official to greet
us

Everyone looks to see a Ninevite and several
guards walking aggressively toward them They do
not look happy

PA GRAPE
(aloof)
Hello We were in the
neighborhood so we
thought wed -

CITY OFFICIAL
(referring to
Pirates)
These are the men Arrest

Everyones in shock

PA GRAPE
But

JONAH
Excuse me What have they
done

CITY OFFICIAL
Thievery High theft
against the Royal City of
Nineveh

LUNT
Thats ridiculous

CITY OFFICIAL
Oh is it

He grabs Larry and spins him around On his back
is a small pack The City Official pulls out a
knife and everyone gasps He slits the bottom of
Larrys pack and 8-10 mini-sized bags of Mister
Twistys Cheese Curls fall to the floor

LARRY
(panicked)
No Wait I thought they
were free samples

CITY OFFICIAL
Take them away

JONAH
You cant do that

The city official spins to Jonah
CITY OFFICIAL
Im sorry are you with
these men
Jonah isnt sure how to answer
JONAH
Well um yes I

suppose

Jonah glances to the side to see a guard
approaching him swiftly

JONAH (contd)
Hello What are you
doing

Jonahs POV - the guard rears back his fish
flashes through the air toward Jonah SFX - SMACK
And simultaneous BLACKOUT

CUT TO
EXT NINEVEH MARKET - LATER

Tight on Jonahs head - covered by a black bag
The bag is pulled off and Jonah blinks around in
the sunlight

Cut to Jonahs POV - a good sized crowd of
Ninevites stands in a circle around him staring
intently at him

JONAH
(encouraged)
Oh Wonderful It must be
time for my speech

Cut to bag coming off Pa Grapes head He tries to
move but is tied tight

PA GRAPE
Hey I cant move

Cut to bag off Lunts head He pulls against
ropes

LUNT
I cant move either

Cut to Larry whos bag is off and who also cant
move

Cut to Jonah who looks down confused and realizes
that he cant move either He looks over to Pa in
his confusion and sees that

(LS Pa) Pa cant move because hes tied back-to-
back with Lunt to the front of beneath a huge
ominously hanging metal fish held up with a rope
This doesnt look good

Cut to Jonahs face - his eyes widen and his mouth
falls

JONAH
Gasp
Cut back to LS pa on bulls-eye Pa looks up and
notices Jonah looking at him with panic on his
face

PA GRAPE
What Have I got somethin
on my face

Cut to Pas face - he sees Jonahs situation

Cut to LS Jonah (Pas POV) - also in the same
situation

Cut to Pas face who echoes Jonahs reaction

PA
GRAPE (contd)
Gasp

Cut to Lund who repeats this sequence by looking
at Larrys situation

LUNT
Gasp

Cut to Larry who repeats by looking at Lunts
situation

LARRY
Gasp

JONAH
This doesnt look good

Cut to Larry who feels responsible

LARRY

(on the verge

of tears)
Im sorry guys I thought

They were right out there
in the open in a big
bowl Very misleading

PA GRAPE
Oh dont go blamin

Lund is cranky with Pa

LUNT
No blame HIM
(gestures over
shoulder to
Pa)
Lets put it all in
cheese curls he says
No I say We need a
BALANCED portfolio A
little stock a little
bonds A little cash or
cash equivalents And

But no Put it all in
cheese curls he says
(to Pa)

Man you gotta plan for

PA GRAPE

Everyone stares at Pa confused Pa realizes what
they are thinking

PA
GRAPE (contd)
(gestures
around)
Not here literally
But
(looks off
mistily)
We were somebody We were
celebrities

LUNT
(outraged)
We are going to die

Lunt is interrupted by the City Official

CITY OFFICIAL
People of Nineveh These
four men
(glances toward
Khalil)
and that small
whatever-it-is

KHALIL
(indignant)
I am a caterpillar
(to self)
Well that is only half

true

CITY OFFICIAL
Have been found guilty of
high thievery against the
Royal City of Nineveh

The crowd hisses

CITY
OFFICIAL (cont
d)
For their punishment
The Slap of No Return

The crowd looks quizzically at the fish poles no
sure what to make of them The pirates look up at
them not sure whether to be frightened or not
The City Official notices the lack of respect for
his latest invention

LARRY
Whats so funny

CITY OFFICIAL
Observe

The Pirates and Jonah look on as the City Official
places a large pumpkin on a small wooden platform
in from of the fifth fish pole There is a hush as
he walks over to the rope anchored to a stake in
the ground raises a curved sword high in the air
and brings it down severing the rope

The fish falls splattering the pumpkin to bits
Pumpkin hits Jonahs face After a beat the crowd
starts cheering and the Pirates and Jonah start
crying like little babies

ALL
No Waaaaaaaaah Etc

Cut to Khalil who is tied with string to the
backside of Jonah He cant see anything

KHALIL
(confused)
What is happening that is
making you all cry like
little babies

Jonah yells over the commotion
JONAH

Why on earth do you take
snack food so SERIOUSLY
The city official turns to answer but it
interrupted by a trumpet fanfare He spins back to
the crowd

CITY OFFICIAL
People of Nineveh I give
you King Twistomer

More trumpet fanfare Camera pans up the
building facing the condemned to a balcony
several stories overhead 2 attendants stand on
either end of the balcony From the shadows
between them emerges King Twistomer (the giant
gourd from Hi Silk Hat - with Goliaths voice) a
very large grumpy-looking gourd with more than a
passing resemblance to the more chipper slimmer
pitchman Jonah has seen on several snack bags and
billboards The Pirates jaws drop

PA GRAPE
Its Mister Twisty

JONAH
Well that explains it

Lunt and Larry squint up at the gourd

LARRY
He looks happier on the
bag

CITY OFFICIAL
(to King)
Your royal gourdliness
These are the perpetrators
of the heinous act against
your curls of cheese

King Twistomer scowls

CITY
OFFICIAL (cont
d)
For their punishment
The Slap of No Return

A rise from the crowd King Twistomer smiles

KING TWISTOMER
Proceed

The city official spins with his sword Jonahs
eyes widen

JONAH
Wait
(to King)
Wont you at least give
the guilty parties the
chance to speak in their
own defense

The City Official looks up to the king

ponders

who

KING TWISTOMER

You may speak

The sword is lowered Jonah relaxes a bit

Well

JONAH

As I understand

it the snacks in question
were right out in the

open

In a large bowl

(pleading to

crowd)

I think well all agree
this was somewhat
misleading
(looks for
support)
Dont you think

The city official glances to the king
softening

ponders
to the city official

Slap them

Again the sword flashes high in the air

panics

The king
then looks down

nodding
KING TWISTOMER

Jonah

The Pirates start whimpering loudly Jonah

no desperately appeals directly to the City

Official

No

JONAH

You dont understand

Im not REALLY with

them

I mean

How

could I be While they
were taking the tour I
was in the belly of a

whale

The City Official freezes - the sword jerking in
his hand The crowd around them hushes down some
The Official looks up to Jonah quizzically

What

did you

CITY OFFICIAL
say
JONAH
(not really
noticing the
reaction)
I said while they were on
the tour I was in the
belly of a whale

The crowd GASPS The Official steps back - clearly
shaken

CITY OFFICIAL
(shocked)
But You are not dead

JONAH
No Thats just it I was
in the whale for 3 days
and nights Then I prayed
to my God and the great
monster spit me up onto

the shore So that I
could bring you alla
message
The official is shaken The crowd whispers among

themselves The kings eyes widen - then narrow
He approaches the edge of the balcony

KING TWISTOMER
Hmm Asparagus Here
in Nineveh we bow to the
Great Fish We celebrate
the Great Fish in our
art

Jonah looks around at the whale images on
buildings and the large metal fish hanging over
his head

JONAH
Yes I noticed

KING TWISTOMER
If what you are saying is

true

The King ponders for a moment The Official steps
up and responds

CITY OFFICIAL

Yes How do we know if
he is telling the truth
sire

KING TWISTOMER
(to Official)
Smell him

CITY OFFICIAL
(confused)
Y-your highness

KING TWISTOMER
Smell him

The Official awkwardly approaches Jonah and takes
a big whiff Jonah smells TERRIBLE He stagers
back reeling Barely able to stay on his feet

JONAH
(apologetic)
Im terribly sorry
Ive been meaning to
shower

The Kings eyes widen

KING TWISTOMER
He has been in the Great
Fish We must hear the
message

This is so unexpected that Jonah isnt sure what
to do next

JONAH
What Ohthe message
Yes

Jonah thinks - but it has been so long he has a
hard time remembering what he was supposed to say
As he stammers Khalil shakes his head in
disbelief

JONAH (contd)
the message What was
the message

KHALIL
Comon
JONAH
(to King)
Its been so long I
(to himself)
Oh Yes Ahem
(collects
himself)

Stop it
The crowd gasps and recoils The Kings eyes
widen

JONAH
Stop cheating Stop lying
And especially stop
slapping people with
fishes Or this entire
city will be destroyed

Jonah looks around dramatically The crowd
shudders The King looks concerned Back to
Jonah who is smiling contentedly

JONAH (contd)
A message from the Lord

PA NARRATOR
Well the King was very
upset He had no idea they
werent suppose to do that
stuff No one had ever
told him that before

A decree is handed to the city official

CITY OFFICIAL
A decree from the King
Let everyone call urgently
to God Let them give up
their evil ways and their
violence Perhaps the God
that brought this man out
of the Great Fish will

give us a second
chance
Score swells Crowd erupts Everyone smiles

Jonah looks around tugging against his ropes

KING TWISTOMER
And let the asparagus and
his friends go free

They are all untied and congratulated by the
crowd Happy happy

EXTERIOR - DAY NINEVEH

Wide shot of NINEVEH The clouds have completely
moved away and its a perfectly sunny day SCORE
is triumphant Birds sing Flower bouquets fly
like graduation caps
PA NARRATOR
So the king and the people
of Nineveh said they were
sorry stopped the fish-
slapping and started being
nice to people

CUT TO

INTERIOR NIGHT
- SEAFOOD
RESTAURANT

LAURA
Wow Thats great

JUNIOR
Yeah Everyone musta been
really happy right

PA NARRATOR
Well almost everyone

DISSOLVE TO

EXT DAY - NINEVEH

Jonah and worm are being warmly thanked by
Ninevites Worm is eating it up but Jonah is
just nodding along Several Ninevite kids run
happily away from Jonah and the worm clutching
Jonah plush toys to their chests

JONAH

(ad lib)
Yes thank you Farewell
Goodbye thank you

KHALIL

(ad lib)
Goodbye all you lovely
people

PA NARRATOR
You see Jonah figured God
wouldnt really forgive
the Ninevites I mean
they had done some
terrible stuff No He
figured God had something
else in mind

JONAH
Sigh
Jonah sits in the sand silently staring at

Nineveh

Worm looks at Jonah quizzically

notice

The worm is a bit confused

KHALIL
What are we doing

JONAH
Oh its time to watch the
fun

KHALIL
Aaaand what fun would that
be

JONAH
Well I did what I was
supposed to do I warned

them that they were going
to get in big trouble So
now that theyve had their
warning its time to
watch God wipe them off
the face of the

Earth Aha

JONAH (contd)
I picked a safe distance
so we wont get singed

Jonah doesnt

Jonah sits back to watch the destruction The
worm looks at Jonah then looks at Nineveh

Time goes by The hot sun beats down

happens

Jonah is sweating

JONAH (contd)
This is going to be
great The bad
guys Finally getting
what they deserve

More time goes by The sun is intense

wilting

PA NARRATOR
So Jonah waited for God to
destroy Nineveh Even
now God was compassionate
towards Jonah and caused a
plant to grow that shaded
him from the hot sun

Nothing

but still smiling

Jonah is
Jonah looks up and sees LARGE WEED hanging
overhead like an umbrella

JONAH
Hmm Oh Yes Very
nice Thank you Very
nice

He settles in to watch some more The worm looks
back and forth between Jonah and Nineveh Then he
notices the weed and looks - suddenly -
hungry

PA NARRATOR
Jonah kept waiting But
it didnt seem like
anything was
happening He wondered if
maybe God was forgetting
something

Jonah stands and looks up toward heaven then back
to Nineveh

JONAH
Alright I did my
job So
fire Brimstone Whateve
r You pick Right over

there

(pause)
Ill just sit here
under my weed and wait

Jonah sits back down and forces a smile leaning
up against the weed Without warning the weed
and Jonah crash to the ground Jonah sits up
quickly and looks around

JONAH (contd)
What - What happened

Jonah spies worm happily munching a mouthful of
weed and sees the partially chewed weed stump

JONAH (contd)
What How could you

KHALIL
(surprised)
Hmm All your whining
made me hungry It was
just a weed

JONAH
(suddenly
despondent)
Just a weed It - it
was my shade It was my
friend
(melodramatic)
Oh dear Lord how could
you let this happen

Jonah mourns for the weed like a fallen
comrade The worm can take it no more

KHALIL
Would you look at
yourself

Jonah looks up - startled by the worms intensity

KHALIL (contd
)
You care more about that
weed than about all the
people in Nineveh

JONAH
Well I

KHALIL
Why are you here
now Instead of back in
the belly of that whale

Jonah opens his mouth but doesnt have an answer

KHALIL

(CONTD)
Because God is
compassionate He wanted
to help you And because
he is merciful He gave
you a second chance

JONAH

(chipper)

Oh yes - and
Im very grateful-

KHALIL
Has it ever occurred to
you that maybe God loves
everybody Not just
you That maybe he wants
to give everyone a second
chance

JONAH
Uh - well

KHALIL
He saw that those people
needed help - that they
didnt know right from
wrong - and he wanted to
help them And that is
why he sent you

JONAH

KHALIL
And when you told them
what they were doing wrong
they said they were sorry
- they put down their
mackerels and their
halibuts - and they asked
God for a second
chance And by golly he
gave them one

(Jonah ponders)
Dont you see God wants
to give everyone a second
chance And so should we

Jonah is initially moved by this truth but then
becomes theatrically pouty - like the spoiled rich
kid who isnt getting his way

JONAH
Well if they get a second
chance - those fish-
slappers - well then
it would be better if I
were dead
(flops onto the

ground)
Oh I wish I were back in
that whale

Jonah is a basket case The worm looks at him in
disbelief

KHALIL
You are pathetic
(pause)
You know patience runs
very deep in my family
but not that deep Im
out of here

Khalil starts to walk off
JONAH
What What are you doing

KHALIL

(turning back)
I wanted to be big and
important just like
you But the world
doesnt need more people
who are big and
important the world
needs more people who

are nice And compassiona
te And merciful
(pause)
Thats what I want to be
(pause)

You can find yourself a
new traveling
buddy Goodbye

JONAH
You cant just leave

KHALIL
Can and am

JONAH
But who will I talk

to You cant just leave

me here all alone
(pause)

Hello

Reginald Carlisle

Khowleel Carleel Howie

(etc ad lib)

Jonah tries to call the worms name - but cant
get the pronunciation right He tries several
times with comical results as the camera cranes
higher above him revealing the worm walking
further and further away and Jonah looking smaller
and more alone

CUT TO
INT NIGHT - SEAFOOD RESTAURANT
Abrupt cut to shot of Pirates peering over booth
PA GRAPE

Immediately the Pirates slide the Plexiglas
divider shut between the two booths It shuts
with a loud whack startling the listeners in the
next booth who continue staring in disbelief

Lunt opens screen again

LUNT

need to help people who
need help

(pause)

dont deserve them

booth to the entry-way where they see none other
than Twippo himself (Archibald Asparagus
dressed in an Elvis-y sort of outfit)

TWIPPO
Oh Well uh would you

PERCY

song
TWIPPO
Not really its more of

a big musical number

DAD
Perfect

WIPE TO

Twippo on stage at Seafood Restaurant Theatrical
lights on him Hes holding his guitar ready to
play

TWIPPO
(singing -
ballad-like)
When I was a boy I went to
church back home in
Arizona
And that was where I heard
the tale of a man whose
name was Jonah
Now Jonah was a prophet
but thats not why hes
remembered
We tell the tale cuz in
a whale he nearly was
dismembered

Horns and drums jump in - big band feel Either
curtain behind Twippo or wall itself pulls back to
reveal Broadway musical-ish set with fake 2D
pirate ship rocking to beat on fake 2D

waves Actual pirates are perched atop fake ship
PIRATES
(singing)
Jonah was a prophet

TWIPPO
Ooh ooh

PIRATES
But he really never got
it

TWIPPO
Sad but true

PIRATES
If youve been watching
you can spot it

TWIPPO
Doodle-ee-doo

PIRATES
He did not get the point

TWIPPO
Compassion and mercy
From me to you and you to
me
Exactly what God wants to
see
And yes that is the
point

PIRATES
(singing)
Jonah was a prophet

TWIPPO
Ooh ooh

PIRATES
But he really never got
it

TWIPPO
Sad but true

PIRATES
If youve been watching
you can spot it

TWIPPO
Doodle-ee-doo

PIRATES
He did not get the point
Twippo now playing the role of Jonah jumps up on
the pirate ship cutout

TWIPPO
Now Jonah set sail
On a pirate ship ina
dreadful gale

Wind blows fake lighting Pirates takeover
narrative as Twippo either falls or flies ona
line into the mouth of a fake whale cutout that
has been wheeled on stage

PIRATES
Got eaten up by a giant
whale
But managed not to be
dead

Twippo sticks his head out of the top of the
whale (blowhole region) to prove hes still
alive Smiles big

PIRATES
(CONTD)
Youd think he would learn
a lot
From being saved from a
awful spot
But the second chance that
he had got
He didnt want to be
spread

Whale cutout leaves - maybe pull in Nineveh
cutout or string of Ninevites for Twippo to scowl
at Musical break - little dance time - then set
changes to Jonah on hill under cutout

weed Pirates get melodramatically sorrowful

PIRATES (cont
dq)
(weepy)
So poor old Jonah -
Now hes all alone-a

Pirates raise energy as giant megaphone cutout
lowers from above letting them yell at Jonah on
hill

PIRATES (cont
dq)
Gotta use a megaphone-a
To get it through to his
head
(shouted
through
megaphone)

Hey

Hill and weed blow away from force of shouted
hey Twippo stands and comes forward on stage
no longer playing Jonah

PIRATES
(CONTD)

(singing)
Jonah was a prophet

TWIPPO
Ooh ooh

PIRATES
But he really never got
it

TWIPPO

Sad but true

PIRATES
If youve been watching
you can spot it

TWIPPO
Doodle-ee-doo

PIRATES
He did not get the point

Musical break - seque ways into more intimate
spoken part

TWIPPO

(spoken)
Now true in your life
you probably dont ride on
a camel
And you probably wont
wake up inside a large
aquatic mammal
But all the same like
Jonah there is something
you can do -
Everyone deserves to get a
second chance from you

Big horn sting then all sing together

ALL
Compassion and mercy
From me to you and you to

me
Exactly what God wants to
see
And yes that is the
point
Start bringing it down Maybe Twippo starts

pulling pirate ship across stage faking an
exit

PIRATES
(softer)
Jonah was a prophet

TWIPPO
(softer)
Ooh ooh
PIRATES
But he really never got
it
TWIPPO

Sad but true

PIRATES
(even softer)
Jonah was a prophet

TWIPPO
Ooh ooh

PIRATES
But he really never got
it

TWIPPO

Sad but true

Stop exit at center-stage - turn and strike a
pose

PIRATES
(loud)
Jonah was a prophet

Big chord - end of song Crowd goes wild Voice
heard from the foyer

KHALIL
I beg your pardon I hate
to break up the party but
who needed a tow

Everyone looks at Khalil
TWIPPO
Ah Have we met

Khalil smiles at camera - cut to black

THE END
