Hes about to punch it When A cop car turns a corner
and falls in beside him Fait throttles back Keeps
driving Until finally The cops turn off And now
Fait hits it Until

Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi-
industrial area Behind him the Escalade tries to follow
but is cut off by the on-coming cars

We STAY WITH Fait He GUNS down the alley Reaches an
intersecting alley Turns GUNS it out of sight

INTEXT ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and
speeding down the alley after Fait The ESCALADE reaches the
intersection Turns And CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled
into its path The dumpster forces the Escalade into a

wall

EXT ALLEY (SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Two men start to get out of the Escalade We recognize
them Lings two thugs We barely have time to realize
that Faits escape has been blocked by construction
equipment down the alley Hes had no choice but to turn
and fight

Which is what he does rushing the passenger

The battles ferocious and fast Ultimately Faits out-
muscled and out-gunned Hes forced back against the open
door of the Escalade guns to his head

two Using all means available During the battle a killer
tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence Almost
gets it When
Two vicious DOBERMANS guard dogs for the junkyard behind
the fence leap out of nowhere SNARLING and SNAPPING and
smash into the fence The killer jumps back barely
escaping with his arm
The fight continues Fait and Su wear them down
Behind the fence the Dobies want flesh Every time someone
crashes into the fence theyre right there trying to get a
piece
Also every time someone crashes into the old fence we see
a series of chain-link connections loosen and break Until
it happens one too many times The entire fence goes down
The dogs are out The nearest targets Su and FaitSu and
Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and
evading the ferocious attack dogs
Finally Su kicks one dog flying Whip-kicks the other off
Fait The two men run for the Escalade The dogs are up ina
flash Su spots an abandoned car A rear door is open

Over here
Fait follows right on his heels
The dogs close in

Somersaults over the rear seat Kicks open the far door and
rolls out Fait dives in right behind him The Dobies leap
in after Fait
Faits airborne completely through the back seat and out the
other side of the car Clears the door And Su slams
the door shut

We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed
door as Su leaps to the cars other side and shuts that
door too Trapping the SNARLING foaming DOGS inside
The bad guys are gone And Faits CELL PHONE is RINGING As

EXT AIRFIELD
The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the
hangar losing altitude Then SMASHES into the tarmac
ripping open the fuel tank spilling fuel behind it as it
caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large skidding circle
around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING
INTO FLAMES
The spilled fuel ignites A circle of intense fire With
Su in the middle
The Agusta pilot still alive has been thrown outside the
circle But Lings only path of escape takes him inside
Into the circle He emerges with the bag of stones
Su is waiting

LING

You were lucky last time You

Wont be lucky again
The final fight begins
The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire
using everything they can lay their hands on Each the
equal of the other Each knowing its a fight to the death
For a long time the fight could go either way Until
Ling gets an arm around Sus neck Like Charles Su thrashes
and flails Like Charles he cant get away

Feel a thing

- I wont You will
What happens next happens in an instant
Su breaks the hold Hooks one of Lings arms Wrenches it

A direction it cant go
Lings ARM BONES SNAP TISSUES RIP
Ling screams in pain Just as Su pulls the ceramic
Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from
Lings pocket And
Slams the capsule deep into Lings open mouth Ling gags
choking on the capsule lodged in his throat His horror-
stricken eyes meet Sus Su lets him suffer another moment
Then in SUBTITLED Chinese --
sU

This is for our friends
And Su strikes him in the throat A spearing open-hand
blow with his fingertips Hard Hard enough that

INSIDE LINGS THROAT

The CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS Releasing the hot glowing
white sliver of stone into Lings windpipe The fragments
super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook
Lings body from within The power of a few thousand
microwave ovens turned on all at once

Lings bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as

ANGLE BACK ON LING

As light beaming from his eyes and mouth Ling flash-cooks
from the inside out

Not simply burned Horribly desiccated His seared and
darkened skin shrink-wrapped mummy-like around his
skeleton Human jerky

In a moment its finished Lings dry-roasted remains
topple over Su has closed a chapter
