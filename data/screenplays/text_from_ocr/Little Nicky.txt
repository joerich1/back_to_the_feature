FADE IN
EXT SUBURBIA - NIGHT

A beautiful late summer night Crickets chirping sprinklers
sprinkling

We PAN across one particular lawn up one particular tree
where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb He
has a bottle of wine some sandwiches a Walkman Suddenly
the lights turn on

PEEPER
(whispering)
Showtime

We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peepers
window She is wearing business attire

PEEPER (CONTD)
Rough day at the office Mrs Dunleavy
(takes bite of sandwich)
Well youll feel better once you slip
off those work clothes and get into some
sweats

The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes rubbing
her feet

PEEPER (CONTD)
Oh my G-D yes I wish you would let me
rub those feet Of course I wouldnt
use my hands Heh heh heh heh

He sips some wine

The mother starts to unbutton her blouse She takes it off
revealing a nice bra

PEEPER (CONTD)
Looks like Victoria just told me her
secret

The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook Mouthing
the words as he goes

PEEPER (CONTD)
Thursday the ninth eight-thirty pm
first brassiere sighting
(stops writing)
I will pleasure myself to this image for
months MONTHS I TELL YOU

The mother starts to unbutton her pants Her young son walks
in wearing a scouts uniform

PEEPER (CONTD)
Young Scottie Dunleavy What
unfortunate timing You mother was just
getting comfy

The son talks to his mother excitedly

PEEPER (CONTD)
Yes yes Im sure you tied many great
knots today or whatever Now get out

The son not going anywhere sits in a chair

PEEPER (CONTD)
Now what This simply wont do

The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials The son
answers

SCOTTIE
Hello

PEEPER
Hello Scottie Why dont you go
downstairs like a good boy and let your
mother freshen up

SCOTTIE
Who is this

PEEPER
Just a little birdie A birdie who
wants to see if your mothers panties
match her bra

MOTHER
Oh my G-D Scottie Is there a man up
our tree

The peeper gets nervous

PEEPER
Tell her no Tell her its just a big
bird

The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises
We SEE Scottie with his sling shot The mother nods yes He
shoots it It hits the peeper square in the head He falls
to the ground with a thud

PEEPER (CONTD)
Mrs Dunleavy please come help me And

wear your bikini

The peeper looks up He sees Scottie pushing a television
out the window It lands on top of the peeper Hes dead

HARD CUT
INT HOLE - DAY

The peeper is zooming down a hole walls of dirt racing by on
all sides

The peeper is falling down down down The whole way
screaming like a five-year old girl

PEEPERS POV

We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the
peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire He
SCREAMS

EXT FIRE GATES OF HELL

We see the GATEWALL OF FLAMES We hear screaming Wham
We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in
a heap in a shallow pit of coals

Dazed he stands and we see other people shooting through the
fire wall at different levels (NOTE All the arrivals
clothes are now burned and shredded)

GATEKEEPER (0S)
Welcome

The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his
station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer

PEEPER
Am I in hell

GATEKEEPER
What do you think

A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peepers crotch area We
leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to

MATTE PAINTING HELL
MUSIC UP RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL BY VAN HALEN

The VAST and insane kingdom of Hell A road leads toward it
like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals We see
the black castle in the distance The camera zooms into the
castle to one particular window

INT NICKYS ROOM - DAY

Looks like an American teenagers room - models a dresser
heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no
bed - Devils dont sleep) Nicky is air guitaring to the
song Over at the stereo we see the cassette playing titled
NICKYS MONSTER METAL MIX
The head demon JIMMY THE DEMON opens the door scaring
NICKY who falls backward into the table breaking it

NICKY
(embarrassed)
Hey

JIMMY THE DEMON
Your father wants to see you and your
brothers in the throne room

NICKY
Okay but Jimmy when the house is
rockin dont forget the knockin

INT BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

ADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts Theyre aiming for
peoples faces that are coming through the wall

CASSIUS
I knew it Hes finally retiring

ADRIAN
Ive been waiting on this day for ten
thousand years

He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead

HUMAN DARTBOARD
Aaaah

CASSIUS
If the old man picks me to take over
Hell Ill keep the torture going twenty
four seven No breaks

ADRIAN
Well Dad says its the breaks that make
the torture You have to let people
feel a sense of relief

Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS
in the eye

HUMAN DARTBOARD
Aaaaaaaaaaaah

ADRIAN
Then again the beauty of Dad retiring
is what he says doesnt matter anymore

Cassius pulls out the dart The eye comes with it

CASSIUS
Ill take that
Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it THWACK
It splatters like a grape

HUMAN DARTBOARD
Was that really necessary

Nicky enters sheepishly

CASSIUS
Hey hows Daddys little girl doing
today

NICKY

Good thanks
Cassius snaps his fingers in Nickys face

CASSIUS
Hey Hey Hey Wanna mind wrestle

Cassius eyes start glowing red

NICKY
Actually Ill take a rain check on0

Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible
force

CASSIUS
Got ya

NICKY
(picking up his head)
Yes you got me

Nickys head slams back down again

CASSIUS
Got ya again

NICKY
(picking head up)

Got me for sure yes

He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the
head

CASSIUS
Got ya Now heres the big finish

Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his
own crotch

NICKY
Oh no Please Cassius

Nickys hand is being possessed It gets closer and closer
until it latches on to Nickys crotch

NICKY (CONTD)
Aaaaah

Cassius concentrates even harder making Nicky twist his own
hand Nicky screams even louder Adrian smiles They dont
notice that DAD wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small
devil horns) enters behind them

DAD
What are you boys doing

Cassius releases Nickys hand

NICKY
Nothing Dad Just re-arranging the
furniture

DAD

Cassius didnt I tell you to stay out
of your brothers mind

CASSIUS
I forgot

DAD
Maybe this will help you remember

Dads eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the
nose sending him back against the wall and down to the
floor

Dad gives Nicky a wink Nicky smiles Dad has an air of
confidence and power

DAD (CONTD)
Now everybody sit down

NICKY
Hey Dad Im almost finished laying
down my monsters of metal compilation
tape I really think its a
masterpiece

DAD
Okay kid well listen to it later

He leads the boys to the throne area We see outside the
window the peeper staring in sexily Dad looks shakes his
head Just then THE BIRD appears and attacks him Dad
closes the curtains

Nicky Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of
his throne Dad lights a cigarette with his finger the tip
of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at
his three sons
DAD (CONTD)
My dad your granddad Lucifer was
thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules
here in hell for ten thousand years
And after this ten thousand years had
passed he decided to abdicate his
throne

Confused Nicky sheepishly raises his hand

DAD (CONTD)

to step aside

(Nicky lowers his hand)
Â»-and let me become the ruler of hell
This as some of you might know is my
ten thousandth year as Prince of
Darkness So I think the time has come
to discuss who will succeed me

Jimmy the Demon walks in

JIMMY THE DEMON
Knock knock

DAD
Yes Jimmy

He whispers in Dads ear

DAD (CONTD)
No no thats not what I said He can
keep his thumbs but the fingers gotta
go

JIMMY THE DEMON
(turning to leave)
Oh and dont forget youre shoving a
pineapple up Hitlers ass at four
oclock

Dad nods and Jimmy shuffles out Dad turns his attention
back to his sons

DAD
This was a very difficult decision
because I have three wonderful sons I
mean Adrian so smart so ruthless
And Cassius so strong so tough And
Nicky soso

NICKY
Dont worry about coming up with
anything Its cool

DAD
Such a sweet boy But after much
thought and careful consideration Ive
decided that the ruler for the next ten
thousand years is going to have to

beme
CASSIUS AND ADRIAN
(dumb founded)
What
NICKY
Hallelujah

They all look at Nicky

NICKY (CONTD)
I meantough break

DAD

The important thing for the stability of
our rule is to maintain the balance
between good and evil And I dont
think any of you are ready for that
responsibility yet You need the wisdom
that comes only with the passage of
time

CASSIUS
Dad This is Hoyashit

Dad glares Cassius goes FLYING BACK One of the Human
Dartboards laughs Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the
tongue Jimmy enters and points at his watch

DAD
Right Right Send him in
(to the boys)
Im sorry boys Ive got to get back
to work

Nicky Cassius and Adrian start filing out Adrian stops

ADRIAN
You sure about this decision Dad

DAD
Im telling you pal its the right
thing to do

HITLER (in a French maids outfit) is being brought in by
Jimmy They head towards the closet

Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples Hitler picks out

a relatively small one Dad shakes his head no Dad walks
over to the closet Hitler picks out a really big pineapple
Dad nods yes Hitler sadly hands it to Dad Jimmy bends

Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit
CLOSE ON HITLERS EYES
As the pineapples jammed up his ass

HITLER
Holy schnit

EXT HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY

Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing
with souls Both are pissed Theres a big ugly Bigfoot
looking MONSTER hanging out with them kind of nodding along

CASSIUS
You work your ass off for ten thousand
years hurting people helping others
hurt people then you get a decision
like that

ADRIAN
And hes dead serious

CASSIUS
Its just such a slap in the face

Adrian turns to the Monster

ADRIAN
Um excuse me were having a private
conversation here

CASSIUS
Yeah get out of here Beat it

Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monsters face
The Monster shrugs and walks off

ADRIAN
Twenty-thousand years ago Grandpa
Lucifer said It is better to rule in
hell than serve in heaven Well Im
getting tired of serving in Hell We
need a place where we can rule

Cassius throws a rock at the Monster He yelps then turns
around motioning like hes thinking about coming back
Cassius sees this and gets enraged

CASSIUS
Oh you wanna be a big man Bring it
on Lets see what you got

The Monster upon further reflection throws his hands up in
an aw phooey gesture and continues walking away

CASSIUS (CONTD)
Thats what I thought
Cassius

The two look at each other

fire wall Knocking souls out of their way

ADRIAN
(to Cassius)

Could you concentrate for five seconds

CASSIUS

I am concentrating Where can we rule

ADRIAN
What do you think aboutEarth

seems to think this isnt a bad idea

ADRIAN (CONTD)

We could create our own hell there

CASSIUS

You saying we go up there and kill

everyone

ADRIAN

Eventually Cassius But first we
corrupt as many as we can so that when

we do destroy them

CASSIUS

their damned souls will be ours

ADRIAN
Its our time brother

Dads EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up Two huge
boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeepers head We
only see them from the front for a second

From behind the gatekeeper we see the boobs but not the
nipples as he talks to Nicky

GATEKEEPER (CONTD)

fully

It
clothed When he inhales through his nose we hear that
familiar snoringsnorting sound But when he exhales we
hear disturbing speaking-in-tongues Exorcist-style voices

SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands
looking concerned

EXT CATHEDRAL - MORNING

We HEAR the bells toll We see the beautiful exterior of a
large church

INT CATHEDRAL

CLOSE ON an ELDERLY kind looking CARDINAL He ascends the
steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation
We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service He
gins his homily

CARDINAL
In todays gospel the Lord tells us who
we are to live if we wish to attain the
splendor of Heaven or something like
that Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in
the Bible Moses this Moses that
Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat

The crowd stares dumbfounded We see that the Cardinal is
standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box
with the top open

CARDINAL (CONTD)
Yep the Lord sure did say a bunch of
hibbity-jibbity But has he ever really
done anything for us Has he ever put a
Jaguar XJR in my driveway Has he ever
given any of my enemies the herpes No
He hasnt done a damn thing for any of
us

A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
The Lord gave my son the strength to get
off drugs

CARDINAL
Maam I know your son and believe me
he was better off on drugs Hes a
bore At least when he was smoking
hashish he made me laugh occasionally

A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up
YOUNG MAN

After we tried for many years the Lord
finally helped my wife conceive a baby
CARDINAL
No your best friend Fitzie helped your
wife conceive a baby He helped her
conceive it all night long

Fitzie whos sitting on the other side of the Wife starts
to raise the roof Then thinks better of it The Cardinal
points to a well-dressed man in the front pew

CARDINAL (CONTD)
How about you Mr Mayor The Lord ever
do anything for you

The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet

MAYOR

(standing)
Well I wish I could think of something
Cardinal but to be honest with you I
cant Kind of makes you wonder if
there even is a Lord If there is any
ultimate punishment for our so-called
sins Maybe we should all just have
fun and do whatever the hell we want

A hubbub is raised by the crowd Fitzie raises the roof
again this time energetically

CARDINAL
Amen to that Let the sin begin

The hubbub grows to a roar Several PEOPLE start fighting
over the money in the collection plate

The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor We hear the
Cardinals thoughts - in Adrians voice

ADRIAN (0S)
Oh this is delicious

ON MAYOR
Hes smirking WE HEAR his telepathic response

CASSIUS (0S)
(laughing)
Let the sin begins - that was a good
one

ADRIAN (0S)
Well we must get people sinning if we
want to fill up our New Hell How are
things going down at City Hall

CASSIUS (0S)
I lowered the drinking age to ten

baffled chipmunk in one bite

Nicky raises his hand and turns the snake into a row of
flowers

Adrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a
lawn mower comes by and mows them down

Nicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER
pushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage

Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who
leaps out and starts beating up on the mother

Nicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF The evil Dwarf
stops beating her up and holds her hand
