FADE IN

on a BLACK WAVE - vast oceanic and coming right at us
BEGIN TITLES

The wave is relentless huge menacing We cant tell if this
is daytime or night because it simply obscures everything -
noisily It sucks it yawns it roars

Then we realize this massive wave of darkness is actually
just a RUN-OFF of dirty black WATER alongside the edge of an
Interstate We PULL OUT OF IT now

to find concrete and garbage and weeds END TITLES
1 EXT DITCH - OFF THE INTERSTATE - 430 AM

Amongst the refuse is a discarded MILK CARTON resting on its
back The carton asks Have You Seen Me above a photographed
face thats been obscured by grime

Yellowing newspaper old Coke cans Twinkie wrappers in
that bed of untended weeds A hollow Texas wind blows through
it all We stay with the carton

Then that hollow wind gains speed and a deep RUMBLE grows
in the distance becoming a ROAR The yellowed newspaper lifts
off and whips past us

»aS an 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by just a blur in the
corner of our frame doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness
Then the truck is gone and the rush of air dissipates The
milk carton the coke cans they lie undisturbed

A LIGHT RAIN begins to fall and some of the grime washes
away from that milk carton revealing a face A child Have
You Seen Me Its heartbreaking

TILT UP to take in the vast flatness of Texas I-35
concrete forever In the distance gray highway yields to
black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently over endless prairie

A vertical vein of LIGHTNING streaks through one of them

INT THE ALL-AMERICAN DINER - GAINESVILLE TEXAS - CONTINUING 2
(430 AM)

HAROLD SPECK sits mid 40s pleasant face A family man
Reads Rod and Reel magazine Has a SALESMANS CASE by his
side Around him is a TRUCK-STOP in twilight

Truckers at the counter Elvis on the wall a Drink Bud
mirror The WORLD SERIES can be heard on a RADIO

DOLLY (0S)
Top that off for ya Hon

Thats DOLLY a waitress (50 been here too long) Speck
looks up smiles thinly No Dolly heads off Speck returns
to his article underlining a particular passage

until a MAN seats himself suddenly in the seat opposite
Specks Speck reacts startled

SPECK
Jesus

The MANs name is ORYAN We only see PIECES of him his eyes
his hands a stain on his parka

ORYAN
Whats in the case

SPECK
Im sorry

ORYAN
Youre always lugging that case around
Im curious

Speck looks around there are plenty of empty tables in here
So why is this guy bothering me

ORYAN (CONTD)
What do you sell

SPECK
Im in restaurant supplies I didnt
get your name

ORYAN
Must travel a lot huh

Speck is looking for Dolly a Manager anyone

ORYAN (CONTD)
Whole country or just hereabouts

SPECK
I dont mean to be rude but--

ORYAN
Hows your wife feel about it

That spun things a bit Speck pauses

SPECK

ORYAN
She must get lonely with you gone all

SPECK
Look I

ORYAN
Do you get lonely

Specks so thrown now he cant answer

ORYAN (CONTD)
Ya miss fucking her Harold

SPECK
Listen I dont know who you are but you
cant--
ORyan silences him by holding up a piece of paper On it
is a DRAWING The image faces away from us But Speck can see

it in rich detail And his eyes go wide

We catch GLIMPSES The color of flesh A body-part Looks like
a rendering of a young naked WOMAN

And just like that Speck finds himself STARING Glued

ORYAN (CONTD)
Did it myself Its sort of a hobby

(no reply)
Ive got more Would you like to see
them
ORyan lowers it and slides a SECOND DRAWING over Speck is

speechless transfixed Cant look away

ORYAN (CONTD)
Tell me those jokes about the traveling
salesman and the farmers daughter - are
they true

(MORE )

ORYAN (CONTD)
(Speck remains silent)
Here This ones my favorite

ORyan slides over DRAWING 3 Again we dont get to see it
And we still havent seen all of ORyans face

But we can see Speck and his reaction Utter horror In fact
he recoils so violently that his coffee spills

ORYAN (CONTD)
Really says it all wouldnt you agree

SPECK
Youre a Youre sick

ORYAN
Thats a matter of opinion

SPECK
Youre sick

He rises leaving the drawings behind We STAY WITH HIM as he
crosses the diner - deeply unsettled He reaches the Manager
(MEL balding 50 in no mood) at the register

MEL
Mmm-hmm

SPECK
Im having a problem - with another
customer Id like you to ask him to
leave please

MEL
What kind of problem

SPECK
Hes--

He turns to point out ORyan

but the booth suddenly is empty The guy has simply
disappeared taking those drawings with him

Speck tightens Mel eyes him annoyed

Speck hurries out to his Buick checking over his shoulder
repeatedly Gets to the car fumbles with his keys They fall
to the asphalt He grabs them opens the door

CUT TO
4 INT SPECKS CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER

Speck guns the Buick Interstate 35 flies by The farther he

gets away from that Diner the happier hell be

until a strange SOUND gets his attention its WIND as if
whistling through a ghost town Hollow varied - building then

falling off again Wind
Trouble is the windows in this Buick are up

Yet there it is again a thin hollow GHOST-TOWN WIND

whistling over his shoulder Hes heard it before - in every
Western he ever watched as a kid
But this wind is coming from his back-seat

The blood drains right out of Specks face Doesnt know if he
should jam on the brakes or drive faster

He looks in his rear-view catches a glimpse of a LATEX GLOVE
snapping onto a hand Dear God ORyan is back there making
that odd Ghost-Town wind sound Whistling

SPECK
(sheer terror)
What-do-you-want What-do-you-want-with-
me

No reply Instead another gift appears from the back a
FOURTH DRAWING tossed from the darkness into Specks lap

He looks down registers the image and SHRIEKS
ORYAN (0S)
Theres a rest stop next off-ramp Pull

into it

SPECK
I have some money Its not a lot but--

ORYAN
Nobody wants your money Harold Just
pull in

SPECK
Why

ORyan rises into frame now like Nosferatu
ORYAN

Because I dont wanna do this at 70 miles
an hour It could be dangerous

Speck finds the off-ramp His breaths are shallow now
SPECK
Please Mister - what do you want from

me

ORyans face a knowing grin fans across it

INT FBI RESIDENT AGENCY - WICHITA FALLS - MORNING (SAME
DAY)

Were looking at the FBIs Ten Most-Wanted List Starkey
is 7 on it Hes 40 white His crime are listed as rape
murder kidnapping

THOMAS MACKELWAY stares at Starkeys image At the eyes

Mackelway is 34 bred for success - bred for stardom in fact
a whiz at everything hes ever attempted

So what the hell is he doing in Wichita Falls Texas

EIGHT AGENTS in cubicles with a ring of outer offices Quiet
phones lousy take-out options hardly a dream gig

CHARLTON (0S)
Got a spot set up for you Tom

Thats RICK CHARLTON late 40s thinning hair friendly
Charlton heads around a corner Mackelway follows

CHARLTON (CONTD)
Ms Potters the nice girl you met at the
desk She puts a package together for all
the new agents things to know about the
area help with finding apartments and
such This ones yours

Charlton stops at a CUBICLE Carpeted walls formica desk A
corner of dull Hell Mackelway eyes it fighting dread

CHARLTON (CONTD)
Not so different from Dallas is it

MACKELWAY
(fuck yes)
No Sir
CHARLTON

Good
An abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells us about that World Series so
we must be mid-October Charlton heads out Mackelway throws a
briefcase on to the desk setting up his world

A framed picture of himself and his BROTHER ages 10 and 15
on a childhood camping trip Address book coffee-warmer
calendar a baseball covered with autographs

He opens up a drawer and casually tosses two bottles of
BUFFERIN into the back of it

but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles
and throws them down his throat as

GRIEVES (0S)
Ya like Frito Pies

Mackelway turns BILL GRIEVES stands here holding a white
grease-stained paper-bag Grieves is Mackelways age not
quite as ambitious But solid decent

MACKELWAY
I dunno What are they

Grieves pulls out a greasy concoction thats wrapped up like a
semi-burrito Pure Texas Tosses it to Mackelway

GRIEVES
Welcome to the minors

Grieves passes by with a faint smile handing out lunch to a
few other agents Mackelway eyes the still-wrapped Frito Pie
God get me outta here

CUT TO

INT WICHITA FALLS FBI OFFICE - LATER

A BRIEF MONTAGE Mackelway in his cubicle watching as THOSE
OTHER AGENTS take calls strap on guns head out on
assignment Men in motion

But Mackelways land-locked writing up an Auto-Theft report
Its drudgery but hes meticulous about it deleting the word
beige and replacing it with tan

His head is throbbing - not an unusual circumstance for him
But after lingering for a half-second on that Most-Wanted

List again Starkey Its a wound

INT FBI OFFICE - KITCHENETTE - MOMENTS LATER

Mackelway struggles with a COFFEE MACHINE thats unfamiliar to
him Filter water grounds etc

KATIE (0S)
Here Lemme do that

He turns This is KATIE POTTER Shes 25 friendly under-
challenged by her job Been here two years In two seconds
shes got the thing percolating Of course

KATIE (CONTD)
It takes some experience

He shrugs not feeling too smooth

KATIE (CONTD)
Youre Mackelway right

MACKELWAY
Mmm-hmm

KATIE
Fax came in for you Its the room next
door

MACKELWAY
Oh Thanks

He rises heads for the fax room

INT FAX ROOM - CONTINUING

A former closet converted into useful space FIVE FAX
MACHINES sit on stands sharing a surge protector One fax
machine is printing Mackelway approaches it

Six pieces of paper await him The first is a TOP-SHEET
written by hand Attention Agent Thomas Mackelway FBI

Resident Agency - Wichita Falls No sender named

He looks beneath the top sheet - at Page One of the fax

A young BOY stares back at him his face photostatically
copied Across the top also-handwritten HAVE YOU SEEN ME
At the bottom of the sheet typed we read

Jason Corey Age 14 Ht 51 Wt 130 Eyes Brn Hair Brn
Last Seen Riverside Ca Date of Disappearance 10-16-99

Mackelway eyes the face then the vitals No idea why this was
sent to him Then he looks at Page Two

A young WOMAN stares back at him this time Another faxed
photo Another HAVE YOU SEEN ME scrawled across the top of
it And at the bottom of the sheet

Anna Casitas Age 22 Ht 56 Wt 125 Eyes Brn Hair Blk
Last Seen Macon Ga Date of Disappearance 5-6-00

The other three faxes are more of the same Pictures and
vitals Faces Facts HAVE YOU SEEN ME

He looks at the bottom of the transmissions finds the fax
number of the sender Dials it All he hears back is the loud
grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line

He eyes the faxes again Its not alarming but its odd Then
Charlton emerges from his office shouting

CHARLTON
Mackelway You gonna sit on your ass all
day or do you wanna do something

Mackelways out of this room in an instant
CUT TO

EXT REST STOP - OFF THE INTERSTATE - DAY

Your standard roadside rest-stop a parking lot with weeds
poking through it and bathrooms you wouldnt go near Those
STORMCLOUDS we saw earlier are CLOSER now

POLICE CARS and HIGHWAY PATROL MOTORCYCLES fill this site
Charltons FBI SEDAN pulls up He and Mackelway get out

Two men approach SHERIFF HARRY DYLAN 50 and his deputy BUD
GRANGER a gangly baby-faced pup

DYLAN
Afternoon Rick
(Charlton nods)
Looks like a robberyhomicide Bodys
over that way

He gestures toward a ravine where a TOW TRUCK is currently
lowering a winch toward an abandoned vehicle

It is Harold Specks Buick nose-down in the ravine teetering
on a rock like the balanced scales of justice

MACKELWAY
Ya run the plates

Charlton eyes Mackelway Easy Hot-shot Mackelway nods
reminding himself to remember his new rank Dylan hands a
preliminary report to Charlton

DYLAN
Fellas name is Harold Speck Traveling
salesman from Abilene

Charlton eyes the report then hands it to Mackelway The
hierarchy is being made clear Very

Mackelway turns this ravine runs right up against a SIGN that
reads Welcome to Texas on one side and You are now leaving
Oklahoma on the other

A vehicle left right on the state-line Odd

Then a NOISE that Tow-Truck WINCH grinding badly Its just
about to yank the Buick out of this ditch

MACKELWAY
(it blurts out)
Hey

Before Charlton can react Mackelway is running across this
weed-choked lot zeroing in on the TOW-TRUCK DRIVER

EXT ATOP THE RAVINE - CONTINUING

The Driver JUMBO is operating the winch from a hydraulic
handle on the back of the truck Mackelway barrels in

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
What the fuckre you doing

JUMBO
Whats it look like Bud

Mackelway reaches past Jumbo and hits the Stop button
himself The winch shuts down Mackelway turns A handful of
LOCAL COPS stand atop this ravine watching

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
You guys ever heard of evidentiary
procedure

No one replies Charlton approaches Mackelway tightens
expecting a reprimand for overstepping his bounds

MACKWELWAY (CONTD)
Sorry Sir There wasnt time

Charlton eyes the car Then Mackelway

CHARLTON
Did the right thing Agent Mackelway
Lets have a look

Charlton starts down the embankment Mackelway doesnt
hanging back as he eyes the TRACKS this Buick made before
tumbling Something about them

He pulls a small CAMERA from his pocket a Minox Snaps off a
few photos of the scene - the Buick the ravine those tracks
some FOOTPRINTS alongside them

Then he heads down the 15-foot embankment

EXT RAVINE - CONTINUING

Its an ugly sight Speck is inches from us but his head is
facing in the other direction twisted unnaturally

Mackelway kneels beside the open window pulls out some
gloves puts them on He will not lean on the car or even
breathe on it his caution around evidence obvious

CHARLTON (0S)
Whats that

Charlton is opposite him outside the passenger-side window
pointing at the DRAWING that ORyan had tossed onto Specks
lap It lies face down on the seat

But somethings been FINGER-PAINTED on the back of it A
RED CIRCLE with a SLASH through it
Charlton begins to reach for it when

MACKELWAY
(to stop him)
Sir

Charlton stops Mackelway indicates Gloves

Charlton eyes him Its irritating being corrected by a guy
you outrank especially when hes right

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Sort of a stickler for procedure

CHARLTON
I imagine you would be

That was a jab but we dont know it yet Charlton puts on his
gloves Mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that Minox
looking over the rest of this car as

GRANGER
(aloud)
Hey Jumbo Toss me down a crowbar

Grangers by the trunk Before Mackelway can comment Jumbo
has tossed a CROWBAR down from the top of the embankment a
ten-pound hunk of iron flying right at us

Everybody ducks as it CLANGS on the roof of the Buick
Jumbo shrugs

JUMBO
You said toss it

Mackelway shakes his head Shitkicker Granger grabs the
crowbar Hes just about to open the trunk as

MACKELWAY
Hold it a second

Granger pauses Mackelway crosses to the trunk and snaps off
a few shots with the Minox

Something catches his eye along the line of the TRUNK He
kneels closer An odd RESIDUE crusty and hard has formed a
thin line on top of the paint in a single post
He takes out a VIAL and scrapes some of the residue into it
Then he sniffs it Pauses

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Smells like clove

He looks to Granger now you can open the trunk

DYLAN
(re Mackelway)
Where the helld you find this guy

CHARLTON
Field Office Dallas

DYLAN
(impressed)
Well now
(Charlton shrugs)
So what the hells he doin here

That one is left unanswered Granger opens the trunk

Mac

elway and the others look inside

There they find restaurant supplies napkin dispensers salt-

sha

ers ketchup dispensers a short-order wheel And a

fishing reel tackle-box a kids bicycle helmet

Mac

elway eyes it all but his instincts tell him theres

nothing significant here So he returns to Specks body

He leans in lifts Specks head a few inches away from the
steering wheel Gently

which is when we learn that Specks EYELIDS have been torn

off

leans in gets a loo

Its gruesome but Mackelway notes it calmly Charlton

CHARLTON
Christ

Mackelway is expressionless But something about these LIDLESS
EYES draws him closer He leans in then BAM We are rocketed
into a series of dark disjointed images

EXT

A WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT

Seems like were standing in a field of TALL WHEAT we cant

say for sure Everythings wet wind-whipped

A MUZZLE FLASH Someone just fired a gun We slump hard to
the ground Then we look up

Mackelway stands over us his face wet with rain Then just
as quickly those IMAGES VANISH and we are

INT UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM TEXAS - DAY

We start on the EYES OF ORYAN Cross-Dissolve to a pad of
paper on a DESK Scrawled on the pad is a WAVY LINE He holds
the tip of that pen upon it for a few seconds as if
expecting to get some kind of pulse from it

Here come those IMAGES again wet wheat a muzzle flash
Mackelway Choppy disjointed dark Then they cease

and ORyan begins to DRAW hurriedly Only half of his face
is visible to us but we can tell that his concentration is
total

His pen continues its furious work a spasm of activity as
the SOUNDS of that vision bleed in the gun-shot the rain

the wind Theyre all alive in ORyans mind

And that DRAWING takes shape quickly The wheat field the
gun Mackelway

Then the pen is set down The drawing is complete
ORyan eyes it calmly then checks his watch jotting down the
exact time and date on to the drawing Then he slips it into a
folder marked MACKELWAY

CUT TO
EXT SPECKS HOME - ABILENE TEXAS - ESTAB DAY
Picket fence a swing on the porch a lawn that needs mowing
A LINE OF PEOPLE file in each bringing food and tissues to

cry into

INT SPECKS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)

Shocked faces Food on unmatching trays Specks wife - JAN

40 and frayed - sits in a chair immobile FRIENDS and FAMILY
mill about tending to her

KIDS hover Two of them a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY and an 8-YEAR-OLD
GIRL sniff back tears as people offer condolences

But the focus here is Jan - her grief Shes shaking

ORYAN (0S)
Mrs Speck

She looks up ORyan crouches down to eye-level one of fift
faces in here Jan half-nods

ORYAN (CONTD)
Just wanted to offer my condolences
(takes her hand)
I didnt know him well but I think
Harold was a much more complex man than
people realized

Jan is so raw that anything about Speck touches her now

JAN
(through tears)
He was wasnt he

ORYAN
Im very sorry for your loss maam

She sniffs back a tear thanks him with a smile ORyan
extends his hand to her She takes it He moves off

Beside her is a FRAMED PORTRAIT of Speck We blow past it an
into the BLACK CREPE that is adorning the corner of the
portraits FRAME and

BAM Were rocketed back into a set of odd IMAGES again

EXT DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME

This time everything before us is a blur of gray We hear
that wet wind We hear our own heavy BREATHING as if we were
running somewhere a VOICE rising above the wind seems to
be saying

(OS)
Please

Yy

The sound echoes oddly as if bouncing off a satellite
somewhere or a distance of time and space

Then the sound and the soupy grayness VANISH This vision just
ended When we pop back out of it were TIGHT on Mackelway

INT MACKELWAYS YUKON - PARKING LOT - GAINESVILLE 1030 PM 17

Mackelway sits behind the wheel of his Chevy Yukon parked
between two big-rigs in the lot of the All-American Diner
Sky looks black tonight It rumbles

And that soupy gray vision we just heard and saw It was all
his

He pulls four more Bufferins out of a bottle in his pocket
Slugs them down This headache is a constant Then he gets out
of the Yukon

INT ALL-AMERICAN DINER GAINESVILLE - CONTINUING

Mackelway enters spots Charlton at a booth - sitting opposite
a WOMAN her back to us

INT BOOTH - CONTINUING

Mackelway approaches The Woman doesnt turn

CHARLTON
Agent Mackelway I was bout to introduce
you but I understand that wont be
necessary

Mackelway doesnt get it until the WOMAN turns She is
AGENT FRAN KULOK 35 sharp pretty when she allows herself to
be But with a guard that never comes down

Mackelway has some history with her so he tries not to react
It takes some effort

CHARLTON (CONTD)
Seems your former office has decided we
might need some help on this one So they
sent out Agent Kulok
FRAN
Tom

MACKELWAY
Fran

That was terse from both of them Charlton takes note
CHARLTON

I guess were skipping the tearful
reunion Have a seat Tom

Mackelway sits opposite Fran She folds her hands

MACKELWAY
Hows things back at the ranch

FRAN
Movin right along

That mightve been a dig Charlton cant tell

CHARLTON
Okay Whadda we know

FRAN
Picked up a foot-print in the back seat
of Specks car size-and-a-half bigger
than Specks
Just like that Fran is piping up Mackelways unoffended

CHARLTON
Kay
FRAN
Wounds on Specks throat indicate that he
was strangled from behind I think our

guy waited for him in the backseat
sprung this on him once the car was
moving

She slides that FOURTH DRAWING to Charlton - giving us our
first look at it

INSERT - THE DRAWING

a STEAMER-TRUNK lined with plastic Inside it are large
ZIPLOC BAGS Inside the bags are BODY PARTS

Its realized so accurately that it looks more like a
photograph No wonder it horrified Speck so deeply

THE BOOTH - RESUMING
Charlton eyes it without reaction

FRAN (CONTD)

Lab picked up talcum traces on the edges
of the paper consistent with powdered
gloves

(Charlton nods)
So he gets the dropped in his lap it
spooks him and the car winds up in the
ravine

Plausible enough until

MACKELWAY
I dont think so no I think it was
pushed

FRAN

How ya figure

MACKELWAY
The look of the tracks Foot-prints near
the embankment

Without embellishing any further he slides over the
PHOTOGRAPHS that he took this morning with the Minox tire-
tracks foot-prints She eyes them

Then she eyes Mackelway Charlton notes the tension

CHARLTON
Okay So our guy likes to draw pictures
of body parts and then spring em on
people Whats that get us
(theyre silent)
Thats what I thought

There is plenty going unsaid here between Mackelway and Fran
Charlton has no time for it

CHARLTON
Oh Fore I forget This came in for you
He tosses a 9-by-12 ENVELOPE at Mackelway who opens it Six
sheets of paper slide out

First one we see is the TOP SHEET of a FAX same hand-written
inscription as the last one Attention Agent Thomas
Mackelway FBI Resident Agency Wichita Falls

They turn That came from the NIGHT MANAGER a humorless guy
named LES Hes looking at the front door through which Dolly
has just entered Pink cowboy boots tonight

DOLLY
Dont start in on me Les I couldnt get

The Manager now throws a glance at the three feds in the

Dolly and Mel sit opposite Mackelway and Fran

DOLLY
He was a quiet guy Normal Liked to read

Is that a lousy thing to say

FRAN

Mel rolls his eyes

MACKELWAY
What can you tell us about the other man

MEL
Like I said I never really saw him
Harold came up complainin about the guy

FRAN MACK

Could you de-- Did you get a--

They each stop short waiting for the other to yield Finally

Mackelway nods Go ahead

FRAN
Can you describe him Maam

DOLLY
Sure He was

Dolly pauses her face scrunching a bit Troubled

DOLLY (CONTD)
Thats weird Guy was in here better part
of an hour We had a real pleasant
chat But I cant remember a thing
about him For the life of me Couldnt
even tell you what color his eyes were

She shrugs apologetically

FRAN
Happen to see what he was driving

DOLLY
That ones easy Its still in the lot

The Bonneville out there with the awful

paint job

She gestures to the lot where an old PONTIAC BONNEVILLE sits
its paint stripped down to the primer Bingo

Fran and Mackelway eye it then one another
CUT TO

EXT DINER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Fran and Mackelway emerge heading for the Bonneville

MACKELWAY
We ought to work out some kind of
protocol
FRAN
For what
MACKELWAY

Interviews Witnesses Looks pretty
silly our talking over one another

FRAN
Fine Ill handle them from now on

He doesnt argue They come to a stop at that Bonneville
stripped down to its primer Time to work

Two agents all instinct We see them study things details
their minds always churning Mackelway pulls out his Minox

snaps off a few more shots Then

MACKELWAY
Trunks ajar

She turns Sure enough the Bonnevilles trunk is ajar
Mackelway approaches cautiously

He doesnt have gloves on him so he uses his jacket pocket to
protect against prints He opens the trunk

First thing he sees is that SYMBOL again a circle-with-a-
slash-through-it staring right at him

But this time its been carved into somebodys back

Mackelway stares So does Fran Before them lies a body
stripped to the waist a chunky middle-aged MAN Dead

Mackelway sighs Things just got tougher
CUT TO
INT ARCHER COUNTY MORGUE - DAY
Harold Speck lies on a table A BESPECTACLED CORONER examines

him Victim 2 BARNEY FULCHER lies on another his ample
frame yet to be examined

The lights are out but that Coroner wears a FLUORESCENT HALO

with a MICROPHONE pinned to his gown He speaks into it with
quiet monotone anatomical terms etc

Mackelway and Fran are here watching Mackelway is
particularly focused on Fulchers face His EYELIDS we now
see have also been torn off Hmmmm

FRAN
Why eyelids

MACKELWAY
Huh

FRAN
No other signs of torture here Why take
somebodys eyelids off

MACKELWAY
So they cant blink

She sighs aloud I know that already Asshole Coroner
keeps his head down speaking into that microphone

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Its a metaphor - to make certain the
victim sees or to make certain that we
see something
(shes silent)
Or maybe its just a fuck-you

Coroner continues his monotone narration then crosses to
the sink

That puts him out of earshot So

a

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
(to Fran quietly)
Im sorry about Don

FRAN
(thrown)
Huh

MACKELWAY
Youre not wearing your ring anymore

That was an attempt at kindness She knows that Still she
eyes her left hand self-consciously while Mackelway loses
himself in those lidless eyes of Fulchers

Then theres a KNOCK AT THE GLASS WINDOW BEHIND THEM
They turn Charlton stands on the other side of a GLASS

WINDOW in a VIEWING ROOM adjacent to this Morgue He presses
a piece of paper up against the glass

On it in typed bold letters at the top we read MATCHES
ONE OF ONE Below that we see that Circle-with-the-slash-
through-it

This is a FAX which Charltons just received He points
further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at
first until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street
map

The ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission Those
scrawled lines take us to The Hope House in Oklahoma City
At the bottom a scribbled name David Dyson and a contact
number

Moving closer to the glass Mackelway nods He just got a
break

EXT HOPE HOUSE - OKLAHOMA CITY - NIGHT

A three-story Victorian residence in decay next door to a
CHURCHSOUP KITCHEN in the middle of Oklahoma Citys Skid Row
Rain falls The street is still

Mackelway approaches this halfway-house A few lights shine
within and the blue glow of a tv Upstairs can be heard the
strident off-key voice of somebody singing

EXTINT HOPE HOUSE - DOORWAY - CONTINUING

The front door is open Through a SCREEN DOOR Mackelway can
see an old-fashioned foyer He knocks Waits

Two sounds dominate the buzz from that tv and the strident
singing which we realize is an a capela version of La Vida
Loca audible through an open bedroom window

But no ones coming to answer the door and its wide open
anyway So Mackelway enters

MACKELWAY
Hello

INT HOPE HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING

TV room is to his left There a single 35 year-old DRUNK
TRANSIENT (well call him PIPER) sits watching Behind the

Piper doesnt look up or acknowledge Mackelway at all Rather
he INCREASES THE TV VOLUME to drown out the singing upstairs

INT HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

We are staring at a BASEMENT WALL that has been covered floor
to ceiling with 1000 identical renderings of that same
symbol the CIRCLE-WITH-A-SLASH-THROUGH-IT

1000 of them in bright red paint against pitch black
enamel Only a machine could have achieved this kind of
repetition Or a maniac

This basement is leaky drafty poorly lit But its also
quiet the sound of that awful singing upstairs has been MUTED
by the basement door and the rain itself

DYSON
Benjamin spent hours down here

Mackelway takes it all in every corner of this basement He
notes a row of standing GYM LOCKERS

MACKELWAY
(re lockers)
Did he have access to those

DYSON
No Theyre staff-only

MACKELWAY
Would you mind opening them for me

Dyson shrugs he thinks its a waste of time - but hell do
it Mackelway follows him across the dank room

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
He was here seven years you said

DYSON
Off and on Its not uncommon for our
guests to vanish for months at a time
Dyson works a combination lock on the first locker

MACKELWAY
I ran the name through our database just
to be sure Theres never been an Agent
Benjamin ORyan in the Bureau

DYSON
No but as elaborate fantasies go it
was one of my favorites
(fondly)

And he always seemed so sincere about it

Dyson half-chuckles he always liked the guy He throws open
the locker Inside nothing Mackelway indicates the next
locker Dyson works the combination

MACKELWAY
Is that what you called him Benjamin

DYSON
Its what he wished to be called

Locker 2 is opened - also empty Only one locker left

DYSON (CONTD)
(re locker 3)
That ones mine

Mackelway shrugs Sorry it has to be opened Dyson sighs
then works the combination Mackelway waits

Locker 3 is opened Inside nothing incriminating a sweater
some old junk two trophies Dyson eyes him See Mackelway
nods Dyson shuts the locker

Mackelway looks to that wall 1000 copies of the circle-with-
a-slash-through-it No idea what they signify

DYSON (CONTD)
He painted one of the walls in his room
too

MACKELWAY
Can I see it

DYSON
Weve painted it over
MACKELWAY
Still might be helpful

Dyson heads for the stairs Theyre wooden slats with more
basement-junk stored below old sporting equipment an old
vaccuum cleaner broken chairs rusted patio furniture

Mackelway follows They climb

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Wait

They stop Something just caught Mackelways eye visible
beneath these stairs a BOX with a bucket of PAINT sticking
out of it

INT BASEMENT - BENEATH THE STAIRS - CONTINUING

Mackelway climbs under the stairs crouching down pushing
aside all of the aforementioned junk He grabs the box

Sure enough that bucket once held red paint - same color
ORyan used to cover that wall Theres also a bucket of BLACK
PAINT here And some used brushes

Mackelway brings the box into the meager light We get a look
INSIDE IT now So does Dyson

Inside beneath the paint-buckets we see a few TV GUIDES a
yo-yo a football Then a BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE
Mackelway grabs it eyes it

He flips through a few pages - odd images a TRIBESMAN with
eyes rolling back in his head strange rites etc

Mackelway sets the book down Then amidst the other materials
in this box he spots a large folded MAP

He grabs it begins to unfold it We see that this maps been
written on in pen Cities on it have been CIRCLED

But before we can get a good look at it Mackelway spots
something else at the bottom of this box a shocker

A photograph of himself

It takes him a second to realize what hes looking at But
there it is a NEWSPAPER PHOTO of Agent Thomas Mackelway

It is part of a FRONT-PAGE STORY dated July of this year
concerning the trial and releaseof Virgil Ray Starkey 7
on the FBIs Most-Wanted List

Dyson cant help but notice the picture of Mackelway

Mackelway stares Suddenly we JUMP BACK IN TIME NINE MONTHS
for a brief choppy FLASHBACK

EXT STREET - MATAMOROS - NIGHT - MACKELWAYS FLASHBACK

Were RUNNING dashing between two buildings of chipped-adobe
hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the
thuds of our own heavy feet

This is Matamoros Mexico a shit-hole of a border town
Squalor and sin We find a DRUNK MEXICAN TEEN He nods This

is the place and sticks out his palm

INT HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING 30
Mackelway stares at that newspaper Starkey - rapist

murderer whose case was just thrown out of court - a stunning
failure for all involved

»aS we RESUME MACKELWAYS FLASHBACK - Matamoros again

INT CLUB - BACKSTAGE - RESUMING FLASHBACK 31
Bad-lighting drunk patrons in a CIRCLE and a DONKEY-SHOW

taking place on a bare stage Feels like weve stepped into

some kind of evil carnival Its dizzying

Among the crowd Virgil Starkey in an ugly drunken binge the
only guy in here who isnt cheering or laughing

Suddenly our GUN is pointed right at his head

Starkey freezes caught Some of the PATRONS around him find
somewhere else to stand But the show goes on

INT HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING 32

That ARTICLE gives us more detail now the reason Starkeys
case was thrown out of court It is this

The FBI Agent on the case had made a mistake in
evidentiary procedure Hence Mackelways picture

On his face we GO BACK TO ANOTHER MEMORY six months ago
INT COURTHOUSE - ANTEROOM - DAY - ANOTHER FLASHBACK 33

Three months have passed since the arrest in Matamoros Now
Mackelway sits in this courthouse ANTEROOM adjacent to a
courtroom Four sour PROSECUTORS surround him

PROSECUTOR 1
Dyou understand how fucked we are

MACKELWAY
Yes Sir

PROSECUTOR 1
Leaving a tissue sample in the care of a
Mexican lab Are you fucking kidding me

MACKELWAY
They assured me that they understood
protocol

PROSECUTOR 1
Well guess what They didnt And this

That registered

INT HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING

Beneath this newspaper article are OTHER ARTICLES all
concerning Starkey his crimes his capture all of it

Mackelways memory just got stoked again

INT COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - RESUMING FLASHBACK

Mackelway emerges from that courthouse anteroom whipped
The halls busy with MEDIA and other traffic First face he
sees is Fran who sits on a bench (wedding ring ON) Her eyes

say how lousy she feels for him It almost helps

INT COURTHOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUING FLASHBACK

The door bursts open and Mackelway storms in No need to look
composed now hes alone in here He crosses to a paper-towel
dispenser SLUGS IT Stares in the mirror

Hes livid embarrassed frustrated - can barely look at his
own reflection

Then he hears LAUGHTER behind him He turns

Out of the darkness of a badly-lit STALL Virgil Starkey
emerges coming into view under a single light

Beside him is a GRIM COP his chaperone Starkey passes by
Mackelway almost snickering Then hes gone Mackelway shuts
his eyes tight His head is pounding END FLASHBACK

Mackelway stares at a record of his deepest wound But what
the hell is it doing in the locker of a transient

Cut TO

INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Mackelway leans in looking around A bed A small end-table
Bathroom A window without bars

From down the hall we hear the sound of a PHONE RINGING then
a FAX transmission An old fax machine begins to whine
noisily creaking Its a distraction

But Mackelways focus is in this room The walls have been newly
painted But theres a hint of barely-perceptible color

beneath one of them Rain from a LEAKY ROOF is causing some of
the new paint to peel a bit

A BUCKET collects drops in the center of the room The feeling
in here is damp mildewy creepy Mackelway remains in the
doorway then backs out

DYSON (0S)
I guess you fellasre never unaccounted
for huh

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUING

Mackelway turns a bit startled Dyson is approaching FAX in
hand

MACKELWAY
Huh

Dyson extends six pages On the TOP-SHEET written by hand
are the words Agent Thomas Mackelway CO Mr David Dyson
Hope House with a street address

And under that top sheet Five more pages

Mackelway sighs takes them from Dyson Sure enough hes
staring at five more faces five more fact sheets Five more
HAVE YOU SEEN MEs

But how would anyone know to send them here

DYSON
Anything urgent

MACKELWAY
(doesnt look up)
No
Dyson is glad to hear it
CUT TO
INT HOPE HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
Mackelway descends having had quite enough of this place

Piper is where we left him watching VH1 in the TV Room

Mackelway passes eyeing those newly-faxed pages five more
HAVE YOU SEEN MES He reaches the door

PIPER
Ever seen a fifty-foot shark

Mackelway stops turns

MACKELWAY
Im sorry

PIPER
Fifty-foot shark Ever seen one
MACKELWAY
No

PIPER
Doesnt mean there arent any

Great Mackelway reaches for the front door again Then he
halts Maybe this guy can be helpful Mackelway turns

MACKELWAY
Did you know him
(Pipers silent)
The guy who used to stay upstairs
ORyan Did you know him

PIPER
Why Is he dead

MACKELWAY
I dont

PIPER
You said Did Is he dead

MACKELWAY
Oh I mis-spoke No hes not dead
(a beat)

You know him
Piper nods

Mackelway eyes him then approaches holding up a copy of that
image the circle-with-slash-through-it

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
He ever talk about this A circle with a
slash through it

Piper rises crosses to us leaning in unnecessarily close
Its unsettling

PIPER
Thats not a circle Its a zero

MACKELWAY
Oh How do you know

Piper doesnt answer Instead he simply starts whistling

But its not a tune coming out of his mouth Its that same
sound that ORyan made A WHISTLING WIND blowing through a
ghost town Building then falling again

Piper smiles backing away enjoying the theatricality of it
stifling a giggle

Then suddenly everything turns GRAINY CHOPPY
Weve jumped into a distorted REMOTE POV of this same scene -
as if watching it through a crystal ball or a broken lens or

a distance of time and space

We see images fragments Piper the tv the sofa Mackelways
face Then all sound breaks up and we are

INT MOTEL ROOM - SLEEPER MISSOURI - CONTINUING

Start on ORyans EYES Then a pad of paper The spasm of a
pen scrawling a LIST on to it Piper TV Whistling Were
in another non-descript MOTEL ROOM 29 a night

He holds down the point of his pen on a wavy line beside that
list of words keeping it there for a few seconds as if
expecting to receive some kind of pulse from it

No more pulse He has lost the connection that had somehow
transported him He notes his watch Jots down the exact time

Slips the pad into that FOLDER Mackelway

Then he starts to DRAW - a hurried but accurate sketch of
Mackelway and Piper just as they stood during that
conversation The geography is fairly accurate

ORyan continues to draw We CRANE OUT of this motel room to
find on the street below

EXT A BAR - SLEEPER MISSOURI - CONTINUING

A typical honky-tonk in a town called Sleeper Missouri Just
across the street from ORyans cheap motel

INT BAR - SLEEPER MISSOURI - CONTINUING

Low-lights dust on the floor Pool tables

LORETTA is a pretty 19-year-old who stands at the jukebox
weighing her choices Shes got a thick curtain of hair which
she wrangles with a CHIP-CLIP Its a habit

She chooses a country-rock tune then heads for the bar
walking to the beat Its fun being 19 and beautiful

AT THE BAR - CONTINUING

The BARTENDERS a stocky guy with a broad smile

LORETTA
(re song)
Hows that

BARTENDER
Little cute for my taste but I can stand
three minutes of it

LORETTA
Ill have a seven and seven please

BARTENDER
Seven and seven Got some id

She half-laughs as if she hasnt been carded in a decade and
throws that curtain of hair from one side to the other re-
fastening that chip-clip Its her best move

LORETTA
Its in the car No ones asked me for it
for a couple years now

BARTENDER
If ya hurry youll still catch the end
of the song

She eyes him are you really carding me He smiles nothing
personal Sugar So she heads for the door

on her way she passes a booth In it we find a familiar
face - Virgil Ray Starkey

He remains still as if he hadnt noticed her But behind
his eyes something primal just took place He rises heads
for the door

EXT BAR - MOMENTS LATER

Loretta walks to her VW Bug Starkey exits the bar She
doesnt notice We TILT UP the lights are off in ORyans
motel room

EXT AT LORETTAS CAR - MOMENTS LATER

It all happens pretty fast That chip-clip hits the ground
beside the open VW door A battered PICK-UP speeds away
kicking up gravel

Were off-road Missouris woods can be seen through the
windshield And Starkey is staring at us Pawing at us

Starkeys hand shoots out banging Lorettas head against the
window hard That makes things start to swim Starkey tears
at her clothes lowers himself on to her

She whimpers WE CARRY THE SOUND OF IT INTO

INT MACKELWAYS APARTMENT - SAME

This is where you go when youve just moved to Wichita Falls
and moneys tight spotty shag carpet chipped Formica kitchen
table scuffed blinds

and one sleepless agent having one lousy night

Mackelway sits on the edge of his bed almost able to hear
Lorettas helpless cries Some nights are like this His head

is POUNDING again Down go four more Bufferin

Above him covering the bedroom mirror is the MAP he took
from that Hope House basement ORyans map UNFOLDED

Its HUGE 6-feet-wide 4-feet-tall obscuring the mirror

As we glimpsed while still in that basement this map his been

written on in pen ORyans notations cover it

Over a THUSAND CITIES on it have been CIRCLED by hand in
RED Each of those circled cities has a DATE written beside
it also in red (46 519 10-26 etc)

Mackelway studies it his face working Another of those
WHIMPERS from Loretta seems to hang suspended Mackelway
shakes it off certain that hes imagining it

He wont sleep a wink tonight We LEAVE HIM returning to

INT STARKEYS PICK-UP - RESUMING

The attack continues its terror unimaginable Loretta sobs
It hurts Starkeys too powerful to fight off We stay on her
face dazed her mind simply checking out

»-until a look of cognizance comes over her brought on by a
SHADOW that just passed by

Then the window behind Starkey simply EXPLODES

Glass flies everywhere and TWO ARMS reach into the pick-up
They grab Starkey by the neck and yank him out of the pick-up
his back sliced open by shards He screams

She cant resist coming to the window where she sees

EXT WOODS - STARKEYS PICK-UP - CONTINUING

Starkey lies face up Shocked Squirming Bleeding Standing
over him looming large as a Grizzly is ORyan A long
HUNTING KNIFE extends from his hand

But his tone to our great surprise is conversational
ORYAN
Hey listen Im sorta new in town Ya
know where I can find a good donkey show

Starkey has no idea how to respond to this maniac

STARKEY
Huh

ORYAN
Oh Forgot Wrong country In America
animals have rights
(pointedly)
Dont they Virgil

STARKEY
How the fuck should I know

ORyan half-smiles then kicks Starkey right in the head
Lorettas eyes go wide Another kick follows to the ribs
Then one to the groin Then

ORYAN
(at Loretta)
Turn around

He said that without looking at her But he can tell that she
hasnt moved - too frightened So he eyes her

ORYAN (CONTD)
(again)
Turn around

She turns away lying face down on the seat covering her
head No idea what kind of terror is to come next We STAY
WITH HER able only to hear what follows

The sound is animal awful - like a pig being gutted - a
horrible SQUEAL covering the GRUNTS coming from ORyan

In goes the knife again prompting another agonized cry from
Starkey Lorettas crying too from fear shock She keeps
her face buried shutting her eyes tight The sounds of
savagery fill the night

Then one last gasp from Starkey followed by an awful
silence and the assault is over

Lorettas too afraid to look up - certain that the maniac with
the knife will be coming after her next

But then she hears FOOTSTEPS trailing away So she rises
peeking over the edge of the window WE STAY ON HER FACE as
she sees whats become of her attacker

Her horrified SCREAM fills the woods

51 INT MACKELWAYS APARTMENT - BEDROOM - RESUMING

Mackelway STARES out the window seems like he just HEARD that
scream Of course thatd be impossible He looks to that map

I dont think the eyes are right

COMPOSITE ARTIST

LORETTA
No they were I dont really know

Composite Artist keeps trying but his attempt doesnt look
anything like the face of ORyan

Charlton meanwhile stands over the body mind racing

A Missouri Highway Patrol car pulls up Mackelway steps out of
it We follow him as he takes in the scene

A FLASHBULB illuminates Starkeys CHEST is got a zero-with-
a-slash-through-it But Mackelway hasnt seen the guys face
yet

MACKELWAY

We got an id yet

CHARLTON
Mmm-hmm

Might wanna find yourself a fender
Youre gonna need to sit down
(Mackelways still waiting)
Its Virgil Ray Starkey
Mackelway pales

We stay on him for a moment as it registers The man he
caught and then lost has killed again No God no

MACKELWAY
(struggling for composure)
Starkey did this
CHARLTON
No Starkeys the one on the ground

Mackelway pauses thinks he mustve heard wrong But he turns

toward the face as ANOTHER FLASHBULB illuminates it searing

the image into the darkness Starkey Dead His eyelids ripped
away

Mackelway stares stunned Cant fucking believe it

MACKELWAY
(breathless)
My God

Its like looking at a ghost - a spectre thats been haunting

53 INT FBI OFFICE - MACKELWAYS CUBICLE - MORNING

The number of HAVE YOU SEEN MEs has now grown quite a bit
45 PAGES sit stacked on Mackelways desk 45 victims He grabs
the stack rises

Heading for the Conference Room he nearly bumps into Katie
the Receptionist rounding a corner

MACKELWAY
Scuse me

She smiles He carries the HAVE YOU SEEN MEs into

INT FBI OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUING

A room has been dedicated solely to those three murders On an
erasure board are the words The ORyan Room

On one wall is the MAP Mackelway took from Hope House over a
thousand CITIES circled by ORyan himself

Mackelway puts down the stack of HAVE YOU SEEN MEs Picks up
a box of YELLOW STICK-PINS affixing them to the map - one for

every faxed face

Heres Jason Corey Age 14 Last seen in Riverside Ca on
10-16-99

Sure enough ORyan had circled Riverside Ca on this map
Next to it hed written 10-16

Mackelway sticks a yellow pin in Riverside

Next the fax concerning Anna Casitas Age 22 Last Seen
Macon Ga on 5-6-00

Of course ORyan had circled Macon too Beside it hed
written 5-6 So Macon gets a yellow pin

Mackelway continues as

FRAN (0S)
Got nothing on the last fax

Mackelway turns In comes Fran

FRAN (CONTD)
Came from a business center at a Mariott
in Dallas Nobody saw who sent it

Mackelway nods Then they both turn Charlton enters the

room

CHARLTON
Whadda we know about the map

MACKELWAY
It matches the faxes Sir Almost
perfectly
Charlton approaches the map 1242 cities circled in red
Mackelway continues with the yellow pins one for every HAVE
YOU SEEN ME (45 of them so far)

Charlton eyes the stack 45 HAVE YOU SEEN MEs Then the
map 1242 cities Each with a DATE beside it

CHARLTON
Whys Greenville in blue

(Mackelway has put a yellow pin beside a dozen cities but
tiny Greenville Texas has a BLUE PIN beside it)

MACKELWAY
Only city where the date on the fax and
the date on the map didnt correspond

He pulls out a fax from the stack a Korean boy named Steven
Kim Age 16 Last Seen Greenville Tx Date of Disappearance
8-7-98

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Fax lists the date of disappearance as
August 7 On the map hes written 10-
26

The DATE on ORyans map reads 10-26 beside Greenville Tx
So Greenville gets the only blue pin on this map

Charlton notes todays date October 17

CHARLTON
Any of these bodies been recovered

MACKELWAY
Two so far Female disappeared from
Dayton Ohio on April 12 And a male
Trenton New Jersey January 5th

On the MAP Daytons got 412 written beside it Trenton has
15 Both have yellow pins in them

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
But both bodies were found over a
thousand miles from where theyd last
been seen One in Montana the other in
Oregon Got autopsy reports on both

Charlton looks to the table where AUTOPSY REPORTS and AUTOPSY
PHOTOS sit - two victims weve never seen before

We see the VICTIMS photographed face up face down waist and
above waist and below Charlton gives the photos a cursory

glance nothing more

But we notice something on one of the bodies the male from
Trenton - an odd BURN MARK on his lower left calf

Looks almost symmetrical horizontal across the calf

CHARLTON
Either of the bodies have the zero on
them

MACKELWAY
No Sir

Charlton frustrated SHOVES THOSE AUTOPSY PHOTOS ASIDE We
look to that MAP a handful of yellow pins in it

DISSOLVE TO

INT FBI OFFICE - ORYAN ROOM - NIGHT
Its 830 at night Mackelway is alone in here - staring at
the map Hes been doing a lot of that lately

The stack of HAVE YOU SEEN MEs has grown as well Every one
of them corresponds to a yellow pin on the map

(Some of the HAVE YOU SEEN MEs have arrived via US MAIL We
see a stack of ENVELOPES in a box each sealed in PLASTIC
each stamped and addressed to Mackelway)

Mackelway eyes the map puzzling Frans right beside him
Assorted papers and leads fill this room including photos he
took himself with that Minox

FRAN
Why you

MACKELWAY
Huh
FRAN
He could be sending these to any agent in
any office in the country But hes
sending them to you Why

Mackelways been asking himself that same question lately

MACKELWAY
I dont know

cant believe how long these hallways are Turns a corner

Air can be heard moving through the corridor But he has
found the right number at last

A tiny CARD fastened to a wall reads Dr Emile Daitz
Professor Emeritus Criminal Psychology It also lists his
office hours Mackelway knocks at a door

MACKELWAY

CUT TO

59 INT DAITZ OFFICE - LATER NIGHT

A tiny cramped hovel Books papers and all of it jammed to
overflowing Mackelway sits across from ORyan

ORYAN

(as Daitz)
The name of this theory was Suspect
Zero

(Mackelway nods)
The idea of Suspect Zero posits that if a
serial killer were diabolical enough he
could traverse the country without ever
being caught killing randomly

Theres a COLLECTION here in a glass case ANCIENT WEAPONS -
crude knives swords blow-darts Mackelway notes them

ORYAN (CONTD)
Tell me what makes a killer catchable

MACKELWAY
Patterns repetition of behavior

ORYAN
Now imagine a killer with no patterns no
tell-tale fetishes no rituals no hidden
desire to be caught A perfect vessel of
evil killing without ever leaving a
single meaningful clue in his wake
Hed be immune to capture wouldnt he
Your task forces your forensics teams -
theyd be helpless

Mackelway looks over Daitz bookshelf volume after volume
about evil the devil the minds of sociopaths the history of
serial-killers ritual killers tribal rites

MACKELWAY
Is that something you believe in
Professor Evil

ORYAN

As a citizen of the world its hard not
to Wouldnt you say

(Mackelway cant argue)
Evil is all around us I think - a part
of the natural order of things Like
gravity Like wind A vast black wave
corrupting everything it touches A virus
invades a cell causing it to
dysfunction Perfectly logical But did
it ever occur to you that something may
have invaded that virus something
capable of using it to mutate so
powerfully

Mackelway pauses considering that
ORYAN (CONTD)

Just because somethings invisible to us
doesnt mean it doesnt exist

Mackelway is silent Somethings off here But he cant say
for sure just yet what it is

ORYAN (CONTD)
Have you ever seen a fifty-foot shark

That wasnt just the echo of a question hes heard before it
was a red flag A big one Mackelway tightens

MACKELWAY
Im sorry

ORYAN

A shark as we know will only attack
humans if he runs out of food But
biologists have theorized that for a
shark of fifty feet the ocean would be an
endless buffet Hed never run out of
food so hed have no need to come to the
surface Consequently we would never see
him Do you follow

(Mackelway doesnt)
Well never see one But that doesnt
mean they dont exist Hence Suspect
Zero

Mackelway eyes those books on evil then those ancient
weapons Casually almost imperceptibly he reaches for his
sidearm as ORyan continues

ORYAN (CONTD)
Some of my colleagues think Im
fascinated with evil I think the truth
is just the opposite evil is fascinated
with us What better vehicle could there
be for creating havoc in the world - what
better instrument - than Man Were vain
were stubborn were deceitful we have
an imagination that is limitless in its
perversions Of course Evil keeps trying
to harness us Wouldnt you

The more he talks the closer Mackelway comes to extracting
that gun

Then disturbing the silence a KNOCK at the door

ORYAN (CONTD)
Excuse me

ORyan rises goes to the door as Mackelway unholsters his
gun ORyan opens the door Standing here is a COED with a
backpack She looks confused

COED
Oh Im sorry I was looking for
Professor--

Just like that ORyan has bolted past the Coed literally
tossing her onto Mackelway exploding into the hall

She screams Mackelway grabs her moves her aside as gently as
time allows then blows out of the room

and one story DOWN A sub-basement

Its a guess He descends gun drawn

INT SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUING

Mackelway emerges B-2 looks a lot like B-1 long and
endless We hear air moving around us pipes carrying water
the wheezing of an old generator

And on all sides of us DOOES a mile of them maintenance

supply No one in here

Tries another door Locked A second Locked A third Locked
Air sucks through a corridor around us He thinks he hears

footsteps around a corner Runs at them

INT SUB-BASEMENT - CORNER - CONTINUING

Nothing No one Just another vast corridor More doors

Then a sound GLASS shattering on the floor He runs down
the corridor passing a long metal CAGE that houses this

buildings FIVE FURNACES Theyre old and wheezy
Its dark behind them shadowy Not a bad place to hide

Farther down the corridor is another door - made of frosted
glass A sign on it reads Neuropsychiatric Lab Thats where
the sound came from he thinks

INT SUB-BASEMENT - LAB - CONTINUING

Mackelway enters The lab is dark He throws on every light
switch within reach and finds himself standing over the
shards of what used to be a GLASS BEAKER

So hes in the right place He scans it five rows of work-
stations ten microscopes per row each with a sink beside it
Lining the walls are wide CABINETS

But theres also a MINI-LIBRARY down here Four rows of
BOOKSHELVES housing medical journals These are the stacks -
perfect for hiding behind

He plunges in Row 1 Doesnt see anyone Then Row 2 Row
3 Row 4 Okay the stacks check out

He walks along the rows of work-stations scanning crouching
nudging open cabinets One has been opened

Bottles of SOLUTIONS sit inside it And a JAR thats been
unsealed Its got GAUZE PADS in it

In the back of the room an INSTRUCTORS DESK awaits Its
tall enough to hide beneath Mackelway slinks around it
Kneels down looking into darkness

Then a NOISE The FRONT DOOR of this lab just swung open
And ORyan just bolted out Fuck

humming the wheezing a slight vibration to the floor beneath
us He walks along the edge of Furnace 1
and is assaulted from above
ORyan falls on him knocking Mackelway hard into the sharp
CORNER of that furnace then down to the ground Mackelways
gun skids across the floor
And his mouth suddenly has been covered with gauze

He wants to fight back but suddenly he finds that his head
is swimming Somethings on that gauze The room is getting
fuzzy
We see the belly of a furnace - flames heat Then our own
BLOOD (Mackelways CHEST was torn open by the corner of
that furnace) Wait Did we just see the glint of a KNIFE

ORyan is leaning over us in utter control

Then ORyans head turns abruptly - at the sound of
FOOTSTEPS And we hear

Hey You Whatre you doing down here

We turn groggily TWO JANITORS rush toward us keys jangling
Its all foggy wavy distorted

We see ORyan RISE Then everything goes black

electricity in the walls around him Slowly he awakens Above

Fran is here Sos Charlton Mackelway tries to sit up The
shock of pain from his chest stops him

FRAN
How ya doin
Mackelway half-nods His chest is bandaged

CHARLTON

MACKELWAY
No Sir

CHARLTON
But you figured youd get a bigger pat on
the head if you wrapped this whole thing
up without any help - is that it
The truth Charlton has him pegged But

FRAN
Sir Im the one who took the call Agent
Mackelway was acting under the assumption
that Id already checked the guy out
Were both to blame

Hold it That was a major exaggeration if not an outright
lie Mackelway eyes her thrown Shes poker-faced

Charlton however seems unmoved

CHARLTON
Did Agent Mackelway attend the interview
unaccompanied
FRAN
(reluctantly)
Yes Sir
CHARLTON

Then whose fuck-up is it

Mackelway eyes her Thanks for trying She nods

MACKELWAY
(at Charlton)
It was poor judgment Sir
CHARLTON

69 INT BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

A lively Sunday Service Lots of Baptists singing a rousing
spiritual Music and praise filling the room

We move along the pews until we came to the very back row
There one man sits Alone Quiet ORyan

Odd expression on his face - its as if he cant hear this
rousing music or feel the power of this place People in the

next row are stomping their feet Music soars

But ORyan just drops his head slowly and begins to WEEP
in the middle of this boisterous congregation

Outside an 18-WHEEL TRUCK can be heard rumbling by with
great force No one else in here seems to hear it

But ORyan shuts his eyes tight grieving sobbing

EXT STREET - OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - CONTINUING

Inexpensive but furnished with all the touches that
Mackelways apartment lacks flea-market stuff lace antique
books photos from other eras Character

And candles Lots of candles They throw SHADOWS of Mackelway
and Katie all over the walls

An odd MUSIC fills the room coming from a BOOM-BOX on the
floor Its a rhythmic Navajo CHANT with Native-American
drums providing the pulse

Its eery tuneless but awfully authentic and it fits the
intensity of the moment Mackelway and Katie coupling madly
their eyes locked Shes breathless

First time weve seen him shirtless since his injury in that
furnace room A FAT BANDAGE covers a quarter of his chest
Dried blood can be seen beneath it

Theres an intensity in his eyes The chanting the candles
Katies body his wound theyve conspired to bring an
intensity into his eyes Its dark primal

And hes been expressing it for an hour without relent
which is why Katie gasps one last gasp then rolls to the edge
of the bed exhausted

She reaches for that boom-box lowers the volume The chanting
dies down into silence She catches her breath

KATIE
(softly)
I cant anymore

Mackelway eyes her then reaches past her and turns the
VOLUME on that boom-box back UP The chanting fills the room
again

And just like that he has pulled her back onto him urgently
That primal side hasnt been sated yet

Mackelway eyes it calmly

He slugs down some beer from a nearby bottle then cleans the

wound with some Hydrogen Peroxide as Katie appears in the

He knows he shouldnt be doing this Its beyond risky But

Theres no lock on the cellar door He reaches for it Then he
stops himself Just noticed something

A NEIGHBOR-LADY visible just over Specks backyard fence is
looking right at him through her bedroom window

Fuck it He enters the storm cellar

INT SPECKS STORM CELLAR - CONTINUING

Seven steps leading to a dusty cement floor Mackelway looks
around

Facing him are the things a meticulous man would store in case
of disaster Cans of food sternos sleeping mats drums of
potable water

And long FOOT-LOCKERS Two of them Thats where Mackelways
eyes go instantly He hurries to them

Throws one open Nothing but sheets and blankets inside He
paws through it finding nothing else

He throws the other trunk open Inside Pillows Fuck

He slams it shut looks to those cans of food stacked on
shelves He approaches the shelves jostling cans from their
rows making more noise than he ought to

But he finds nothing behind them except more cans He
approaches those two huge drums of water lugs them aside
Behind them is a tall CUPBOARD locked

He pulls at the cupboard door hard It splinters

Inside a rifle and some boxes of ammo same as youd find
in every other storm-cellar in Texas

He pauses Am I crazy

CUT TO

something through the Entry Hall window

climbs the stairs

If he stays quiet he might just pull this off

INT SPECKS HOUSE - SECOND STORY - CONTINUING

A tiny hallway with four doors Up ahead dangling from the
ceiling is a tiny rope which promises a set of hidden fold-
out stairs and an attic

Mackelway tugs on the rope The fold-out stairs drop down out
of the ceiling Then he hears

NEIGHBOR LADY (0S)
Hes inside Hes inside Went in through
the back

which means he has mere seconds before this all blows to
hell So he climbs up those fold-out stairs

The two ABILENE COPS now circle the house entering through
the back-porch door just as Mackelway did

He pulls up the folding stairs Maybe the guysll do a half-
assed search and then leave

INT SPECKS HOUSE - ATTIC- CONTINUING

Mackelway looks around lots of dusty junk around here - old
clothes mementoes

and one more trunk A steamer-trunk Huge And locked
Looks just like the one in that DRAWING rendered by ORyan

Mackelway races for it Takes out his gun uses the butt-end
to bust the lock off Throws it open

as we hear the sound of those fold-out steps being tugged
down from the second-floor hallway And
ABILENE COP 1 (0S)
Freeze Asshole

The COP is just ten feet away most of him still concealed by
those steps - gun trained right on us

But Mackelway seems utterly untroubled

MACKELWAY
(calmly)
Its okay Fellas FBI

ABILENE COP 1
Ill bet

Mackelway drops his gun kicks it toward the cop who doesnt
quite know what to make of that

Also confusing him is the odd smile playing its way across
Mackelways face But we understand it now

The inside of that steamer-trunk is filled with BODY PARTS
bagged stacked and sealed in Ziplocs

Powdered LIME is sprinkled on them

Mackelway stares at once satisfied and sickened COP 1 can
be heard approaching across the attic floor His gun is
drawn

fight)

Its crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with
oil of Clove the clove neutralizes the
odor of the acid

Charlton shakes his head he is not getting through

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
It was SPECK not his killer who was
hiding something

CHARLTON
Ever ask yourself why a big shot agent
from Dallas gets sent down to the
Wichita Falls Field Office Ill give
you TWO WORDS Hell Ill even write it

down for ya

Charlton leans in to emphasize his point He pulls out a pad
and pencil from his breast pocket and writes what he says using
Mackelways chest as support Its humiliating

CHARLTON (CONTD)
EVIDENTIARY PROCEDURE Dont talk about
it Learn it

Those words just hang there haunting Mackelway Charlton
tears off the sheet with those two words and stuffs them into
Mackelways hand

CHARLTON (CONTD)
Turns out you were right about this guy
You were right about both of them But
that doesnt change the fact that you
went about your business like a rookie
Got it

Charlton turns the buzz of a street lamp breaks the silence
throwing a circle of light around the Yukon Mackelway watches
as Charlton puts on his headlights and drives away

A sudden gust of wind tears that piece of paper out of
Mackelways hand he stares at it as it disappears into
darkness

was in that file now PAGES are splayed across Mackelways
coffee table

A copy of an FBI ID BADGE xeroxed memoes test scores
citations evaluations reports The entire career of Special
Agent Benjamin ORyan in black and white

FRAN
Thats impossible

fq

MACKELWAY
m look at his whole history
Citations letters of commendation even
his fucking test scores from Quantico
The guy was an agent

FRAN

MACKELWAY
Listen to me--

Then we hear a BEEP Call-Waiting Great

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Shit Hold on

That irritated her Mackelway clicks over

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Yes

ORYAN (THRU PHONE)
Read anything interesting lately

Mackelways eyes go wide

MACKELWAY

to Fran

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
That was him

FRAN
He called you at home

MACKELWAY
Yes

BEEP Call-Waiting again

FRAN

Mackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye

MACKELWAY (INTO PHONE)

ORYAN

MACKELWAY
Zeros a myth You made him up

ORYAN

MACKELWAY
Do you
Sounds like ORyan just laughed Then another curve
ORYAN

Was she pretty

MACKELWAY
Huh

ORYAN
I could hear her moaning right under the
Navajo chanting Whole thing was
downright tribal Whats she look like

That was unsettling Very Mackelway looks around feeling
violated feeling watched He draws the blinds Double bolts
the front door Runs his hand under the window frame for any
kind of wire tapping

But Mackelway wont allow himself to over-react Not now with
ORyan on the phone

MACKELWAY
(calmly)
You tell me

ORyan laughs He liked that
ORYAN
Fair enough Well stick to business

Howd ya like my old room

MACKELWAY
Huh
ORYAN
Hope House You were there

How the hell did he know that Its unsettling

ORYAN (CONTD)
Dyson re-paint it
(no reply)
My room Did he re-paint it

MACKELWAY
Yeah White

ORYAN
But you saw what was underneath of
course

MACKELWAY

No Tell me about it

ORYAN
No You tell me

CLICK ORyan just hung up Mackelway stares at the phone
CUT TO

120 INT HOPE HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT (9 PM)

More rain falls outside Lightning too Mackelway waits here
Pipers in his usual spot in front of the TV Dyson descends
the stairs a bit testy tonight

DYSON
Welcome back

That had some edge Mackelway doesnt reply
CUT TO

121 INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS FORMER ROOMHALLWAY - NIGHT

Mackelway stands in the center of this room Dyson in the
doorway That SINGER down the hall is at it again off-key as
ever Tonight its the Gilligans Island theme-song

DYSON

Ill be in my office
Dyson backs away leaving the door ajar
Now Mackelway is alone - eyeing the tiny bed sink window
the leaky ceiling the bucket the peeling paint This room is
heaving with energy
He sits on the bed checks his watch 905 pm
Opposite this bed is that WALL re-painted in industrial
white with the hint of a shape underneath Its what
Mackelways come here to investigate INTERCUT WITH

INT MOTEL ROOM - DENTON TEXAS - SAME

ORyan sits at a desk eyes closed writing pad at his wrist
On it more of those unidentifiable lines become visible to
us Theyre called IDEOGRAMS

He holds the point of his pen down upon one of them as if
receiving information from it and we jump back into

INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS FORMER ROOM - RESUMING
Mackelway Sitting Staring Outside this room we hear that
awful toneless singing as it fills the hallway

Mackelway rises approaching that re-painted wall He pulls
out his keys Checks to see that no ones watching

INT MOTEL ROOM - DENTON TEXAS - RESUMING

ORyan his pen on that pad his concentration total

INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS FORMER ROOM - RESUMING

We hear the singing the TV the rain that bucket collecting
drips Semi-darkness until MORE LIGHTNING throws a burst of

white light against that wall

A faint shape becomes visible just beneath the white paint
Then it vanishes again

Using his keys he begins to scratch away at the white paint

Its an irrational thing to do - but in the context of the
last few days it makes an odd kind of sense

Instantly a hint of BLACK can be seen underneath

INT MOTEL ROOM - DENTON TEXAS - RESUMING

ORyan at that desk Outside he can hear an 18-WHEEL TRUCK
rumble by He doesnt allow it to distract him

INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS FORMER ROOM - RESUMING

Mackelway scratches more of the white paint off of that wall
More BLACKNESS appears beneath it Then a SOUND behind him
He turns

The door to this room just SHUT someone outside mustve
pushed it He keeps scratching at the paint

LIGHTNING rages outside We PULL BACK away from that wall
which gives us the opportunity to see something that Mackelway
is too close to the wall to see for himself

There is indeed an image beneath that thin coat of white
paint It is the shape of a vast black WAVE A hand-painted
image as large as this wall itself

Mackelway seems tiny by comparison and the mere inch of black
that he has uncovered so far seems infinitesimal

In fact it almost look as if the wave is poised to swallow
him whole and he cant even see it

But we can Mustve taken ORyan days to paint something this
large A vast black wave Evil itself

And Mackelway without meaning to is about to unleash it
INT MOTEL ROOM - DENTON TEXAS - RESUMING

ORyan somehow seems to be sensing what is going on in that
room Or maybe hes just feeling the power of that wave from

memory Or maybe hes just plain crazy

But he and Mackelway on some unspoken psychic level are
feeding one another

INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS FORMER ROOM - RESUMING

Mackelway chips away at that white paint moving rapidly
revealing more of the blackness underneath We PUSH IN on it
moving past Mackelway and his frantic scraping

Then were beneath that thin coat of white and

INT INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - UNDETERMINED TIME

Somehow weve submerged into the wave itself A black tidal
force of nature

And it is MOVING Alive We hear the SOUNDS of it a sucking
a yawning as if a tide were drawing back just before
exploding forward

The sounds blend in with the wind the rain the drops in that
bucket Evil itself on the move gathering might And were
along for the ride

The wave begins to roll forward now as if shot from a cannon
It is massive powerful dark And were right on its forward

edge as if surfing it somehow

INT MOTEL ROOM - DENTON TEXAS - RESUMING

ORyan reacts Something just changed

INT INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - RESUMING
The wave is rushing us forward with this speed and power of a
tsunami
which is when we hear the laughter of a LITTLE BOY
INT MOTEL ROOM - DENTON TEXAS - RESUMING
ORyan just heard it too Then new images come at him - but

they are at first GRAINY CHOPPY

EXT UNIDENTIFIED PLAY AREA - SAME
The sounds of that wave become fainter receding to the
background giving way to that sound of laughter and the
squeaking of a PLAY-SET SWING

Like an old tv slowly gaining reception the image takes a
moment to crystallize before us But then it sharpens

Were in the PLAY AREA of a TRUCK-STOP DINER but it feels
like were looking at it through a broken lens The images
appear SPHERICAL to us surrounded by darkness

Before us a 5-year old plays on a swing Call him CHARLIE

135 INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS FORMER ROOM - RESUMING

Mackelway has scraped away more of the white paint now -
enough to see the outline of the front edge of the black wave
its lip He continues

136 INT MOTEL ROOM - DENTON TEXAS - RESUMING

ORyan tightens We cant tell if he experiencing something
from the past the present the future

137 EXT PLAY-AREA - RESUMING

We WHIP AROUND quickly getting a look into the diner itself
There through a window we see a WOMAN presumably Charlies
mother Her names KATHLEEN 40

Kathleen has her back turned to us because shes busy
diapering her nine month-old BABY at a table

138 INT MOTEL ROOM - DENTON TEXAS - RESUMING

ORyan at his desk seems to be getting all of this And it
is agitating him Theres perspiration on his forehead

139 EXT PLAY AREA - RESUMING

The sound of that wave is still a presence Charlie looks up
at us as he swings His smile is pure genuine

We whip around for another look at Kathleen Shes still busy
with that diaper Then we look back to Charlie

INT MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

ORyan keeps his eyes shut his focus total but every part
of him is becoming tense

INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS FORMER ROOM - RESUMING

Mackelway is beginning to perspire from the effort More of
that wave is visible to him But he doesnt step back to take
that in

EXT PLAY AREA - RESUMING

That swing is now EMPTY dangling gently And were running
we know not where

INT MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

ORyans foot starts to tap anxiousness discomfort

EXT PLAY AREA - RESUMING

We run toward a PARKING LOT But we do so smoothly without
effort as if being carried by that relentless black wave

Then ANOTHER SOUND bleeds in The BANGING of the Diners back
door which leads on to that Play Area

And we hear a horrified yell

KATHLEEN (0S)
Charlie Charlie where are you Honey
(fainter)
Charlie Honey are you out here

The sound begins to break up as if on a bad radio being taken
over by the sounds of that awful WAVE

INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS FORMER ROOM - RESUMING
Mackelway suddenly stops as if some electric charge had

just shot through him short-circuiting him into stillness He
begins to step away from the wall

INT MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

ORyan has lost the pulse - the connection that had allowed
him inside what we just witnessed

He rises hurrying into a tiny bathroom We STAY ON THAT
WRITING PAD trying to decipher these lines and squiggles -

the ideograms - as we hear the sounds of ORyan retching

INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS FORMER ROOM - RESUMING

Mackelway sits on the bed looking at what hes just
uncovered An awesome sight His head is pounding worse than
ever so he reaches for the Vicoden

EXT PLAY-AREA - RESUMING

Weve stepped out of that SUBJECTIVE POV now Kathleen grabs
her infant distraught as another massive 18-WHEEL TRUCK
blows by us in the distance

INT MOTEL ROOM - DENTON TEXAS - RESUMING

ORyan washes his face eyes his reflection in the mirror
scrutinizing himself

INT HOPE HOUSE - ORYANS FORMER ROOM - RESUMING

On the wall opposite Mackelway that huge black wave is now
entirely visible to him Bits of chipped white paint litter
the floor

A vast black wave It fills the whole wall

Mackelway eyes his watch Its one oclock in the morning
Hes been in here for four hours That seems impossible

CUT TO
a box slamming down hard on a desk We are

INT FBI OFFICE - ORYAN ROOM - LATE NIGHT

230 am Mackelway is in here by himself angry He reaches
into that box Inside More pins BLACK ONES He crosses to
the map

CLOSE-UP MACKELWAY

He starts pulling out the YELLOW PINS weve grown accustomed
to seeing on this map replacing them with the BLACK ONES
tossing the discards onto the floor

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES

as Mackelway replaces pin after pin
Mackelways face as he backs away from that huge map

INT FBI OFFICE - ORYAN ROOM - LATER NIGHT

Ten minutes have passed but Mackelway has seen a revelation
We can read it on his face

He eyes the map which has now been stuck with over 1000
BLACK PINS one for each city with a HAVE YOU SEEN ME to its
credit

And those black pins seen from a distance form a pattern we
werent expecting - something that never quite took shape when
the pins were yellow

Looks like a big black WAVE And thats just what it is

1000 black dots conspiring to form the same exact shape that
ORyan had painted onto the wall of his room - a massive wave
of darkness gathering strength

But this black wave is consuming America

Mackelway stares at it awed even a bit frightened The thing
seems vast unstoppable A black wave - pure malevolence

covering the states like a fog

One blue dot lies in its center that blue pin in the heart
of Greenville Texas Then piercing the silence

CHARLTON (0S)
Mackelway turns Charlton leans in the doorway

Got one of those pins in Denton yet

CHARLTON (CONTD)

ORyan was spotted there tonight Took a
squad-car and a side-arm from a State

Trooper Bout an hour later a five-year
old boy was abducted roughly a mile up

the Interstate

Its 3 am Whats this guy doing here

Charltons at a loss

CHARLTON (CONTD)

The vehicle was found in an abandoned

lot Were establishing a perimeter
around the city now

MACKELWAY
(knows already)
But the Trooper wasnt hurt

CHARLTON
What makes you so sure

MACKELWAY
Professional courtesy

until Mackelway gestures to the table

where he has laid out ORyans entire FBI File Every memo

citation

Charlton eyes it

letter id picture 150 pages

not with Mackelway watching So he just nods

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Is that possible Sir An agent can
just be deleted

CHARLTON
Looks like it

Mackelway pauses Its a depressing reality

MACKELWAY
I couldnt understand it before - pushing
Specks car onto the state line Makes
sense now He wanted to make the case
Federal Hes drawing us in

CHARLTON

calmly Hes not going to let his jaw drop
Why would he do that

MACKELWAY
So wed be paying attention when he found
Suspect Zero

CHARLTON
Ya know what Im getting extremely tired
of hearing that word In fact thats
gonna be policy from now on No Zero
MACKELWAY
Sir profile the guy Hes straight outta
Quantico All hes doing is working a
case like we would Hes not kidnapping
little kids - hes chasing the guy whos
doing the kidnapping Look at the map

CHARLTON

Whatre you saying - that all these
abductions are the work of one guy Do
you know how fucking insane that is

(over Mackelway)
Not lets try something that actually
makes sense He sends in these faxes
picks off three scumbags For what So
well think exactly what youre thinking
right now - that weve got a friend out
there somebody willing to take out the
garbage for the rest of us And its all
horse-shit

MACKELWAY
What if it isnt What if there really is
a Zero out there and ORyans the one guy
whos got a shot at him

CHARLTON
(just blew his top)
Fucks sake Mackelway - when did you
start buying into this guy

A beat Mackelway lets the silence hover

MACKELWAY
(quietly)
Hes smarter than we are

CHARLTON
Speak for yourself

Charlton heads for the door

MACKELWAY
Sir What if I told you I knew how to
catch him

Charlton stops Turns

CHARLTON
Do you

MACKELWAY
And what if I told you that the way Id
catch him involved sitting in a dark
room with nothing in front of me but a
pad of paper until Id tapped into
some kind of energy out there The
collective unconscious Something If I
told you I thought I could target and

(MORE)

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
locate him without ever leaving this
building what would you say

CHARLTON
Id say youd watched too many X-Files

MACKELWAY
Yever heard of a project called
Icarus Sir

CHARLTON

No
Mackelway tosses over a few pages from ORyans file

MACKELWAY
Agents trained to see distant
locations using nothing but the mind
They called it Remote Viewing

Charlton eyes the pages without comment

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Army stole it from the Soviets The
Bureau stole it from the Army - used it
to track serial killers

(a beat)
Experimental program ORyan was the
first agent they recruited

CHARLTON
Good for him

MACKELWAY
Voodoo right Pure Bullshit
(Charltons waiting)
»except it worked Its how he drew
this
Mackelways referring to that DRAWING a steamer-trunk filled
with ghastly Ziploc bags

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Hed never been in that house before He
just saw what was in there - the Bureau

taught him how same one that deleted
him Same one thats trying to catch him
now Does anything about all this

strike you as odd
Charlton studies him a long beat measuring him Then

CHARLTON
Im going to Denton at Oh-Six-Hundred
You can take the day off

With that hes gone - leaving Mackelway alone in here
Nothing to look at but that black wave He hears Charlton
leaving the building

He slams another Vicoden then hears a PHONE RING Fuck it
Hes not moving Let Voice Mail get it

-until he hears the sound of a FAX coming in
He rises Follow him

155 INT FBI OFFICE - CUBICLES - CONTINUING

Mackelway hurries through the office as the sound of that fax
grows louder

156 INT FAX ROOM - CONTINUING

He enters The fax has spun out a single sheet No top-sheet
Thats odd

But heres another face another victim with the customary

those vitals They mean something Greenville

INT FBI OFFICE - ORYANS ROOM - RESUMING

He re-enters and approaches that huge MAP Theres that wave
of black pins with the one BLUE PIN in its center
Greenville with a 10-26 written beside it

Mackelway pulls out the lone blue pin replaces it witha
black one Now the wave is complete All black

INT WHEELER - CAB - MOVING - NIGHT

Weve seen this truck before - several times in fact It
rumbles along the highway We dont see whos driving but we
do see whos in the passenger seat

Its Charlie five years-old whose abduction we just
witnessed He sleeps fitfully

A MANS HAND can be seen edging into frame - the DRIVER He
picks up a CASSETE shoves it into the tape deck

And out comes the sound of Barney the Dinosaur

BARNEY (THRU DASHBOARD STEREO)
Oh silly songs get sillierWhen you hear
them once againAnd maybe youre hearing
an echoOr maybe its only a friend

The truck continues to rumble along

Cut TO

INT FBI OFFICE - OUTSIDE THE ORYAN ROOM - MORNING 159

6 am Fran pauses outside the ORyan Room where Mackelway
sleeps on a chair Poor guy was here all night

She regards him then her eyes find that MAP and the gaping
black wave across it A horrible image

She studies Mackelway again almost tenderly until

CHARLTON (0S)
Does he listen to you

She turns startled Heres Charlton right behind her And
shes been caught watching Mackelway sleep

FRAN
Im sorry
CHARLTON
Its not a strength of his Im noticing

that lately

Truth is she doesnt like Charlton Or trust him

FRAN
Hes fine
CHARLTON
Im not so sure
(a beat)

You oughtta sit him down remind him how
a chain-of-command works

FRAN
Hes fine Sir

CHARLTON
Talk to him

With that hes gone Fran watches as he heads for the Front
Door and exits

She looks back to Mackelway He awakens with a start Thinking
no ones watching he pops another Vicoden

INT ORYAN ROOM - CONTINUING
Fran enters feeling slightly dirty from that exchange
Mackelway checks his watch as a few AGENTS exit the suite

MACKELWAY
They going to Denton

FRAN
Mmm-hmm

MACKELWAY
But not you

FRAN
Sitting in on two autopsies

MACKELWAY
Oh

He rises Heads for the door stiff She looks at those ORyan
FBI DOCUMENTS NOW - her first time seeing them

FRAN
You okay

MACKELWAY
Yeah Why

FRAN
Nothing

She leaves it at that Hes about to exit when

MACKELWAY
Are they male or female

FRAN
Huh

MACKELWAY
The autopsies

FRAN
Females - Logan Utah and Decatur
Alabama

(Neither city is represented with black pins on that map)

She slides over a packet of PHOTOS two FEMALE VICTIMS
photographed in separate morgues - face up face down waist
and above waist and below etc

Mackelway eyes them then leaves the room We STAY WITH
FRAN taking in that ORyan FBI file It troubles her

Mackelway returns carrying the 9-by-12 envelope that Katie
gave to him

FRAN (CONTD)
(re ORyans file)
So is this what happens when an agent
spins out He gets deleted

MACKELWAY
Sometimes The lucky ones get sent to
Wichita Falls

She breathes out an ironic laugh He hands over the envelope
opens it Inside that photo of Karen Sumpter Mackelway
didnt pay much attention to it before

Fran eyes the photo then the vitals

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Friend of the Receptionist missing for
about a year now I told her Id let her
know if the body ever turned up

Fran doesnt look up from the photo

FRAN
The Receptionist

MACKELWAY
Her names Katie

She half-smiles You mean the one youve been fucking He
shrugs confirming nothing - wishing Fran werent quite so
smart She puts the photo back into the envelope

FRAN
I see you got the blue pin out of
Greenville

MACKELWAY
Yeah Last night Kid named Simms

That confused her
FRAN
(re Sumpter)
No I meant her The girl

That confused him

MACKELWAY
Whatre you talking about

FRAN
Did ya look at her vitals

She hands him the material on Karen Sumpter

FRAN (CONTD)
Greenville Texas October 26

He grabs the material looks at it for the first time

The one on top is the one that came in last night Lloyd

At last a pattern A break

Mackelway grabs the Simms fax hurries out of the room
Nearest Agent is Grieves Mackelway hands him the fax

MACKELWAY
Need an address on this fax line

Grieves has done this on fifty different faxes now it never
yields their suspect but

GRIEVES

Mackelway leans back in to the ORyan Room

MACKELWAY
ORyans in Greenville

FRAN
What makes you think so

MACKELWAY

Thats where Zero is

(Frans a blank)
Lloyd Simms - October 26 99 Karen
Sumpter - October 26 2000 Both
disappeared from Greenville

(still no reply)
Zero comes back to the same spot once a
year Todays the 25th

FRAN
Wait When did we establish that Zero was
real

MACKELWAY

ORyan thinks so

FRAN
Do you

Thats the million-dollar question and it hangs there

Mackelways about to answer when he stops himself Just
noticing something That MORGUE PHOTO from Logan Utah

Theres a BURN MARK on the lower left calf of the victim
Weve seen such a mark before on another autopsy photo

MACKELWAY
Ive seen this before

FRAN
Huh

He doesnt answer just hurries to a thick BOX OF OTHER
AUTOPSY FILES AND PHOTOS Starts rifling through them

until he finds the one weve seen before The body from
Trenton He extracts it Eyes it A confirmation

He lays the two PHOTOS side by side Looks to Fran

MACKELWAY
Same burn-mark
(she leans in)
I saw it before but it didnt register

Fran eyes the photos No doubt about it - they both have the
same burn mark on the lower left calf a symmetrical almost
horizontal stripe across the flesh

FRAN
He burns them

MACKELWAY
I dunno Almost looks too symmetrical to
be a burn
(re Logan victim)
Theyre autopsying her this morning

FRAN
Yeah

She gets the idea Find out where the hell this mark on the
leg came from Grieves enters

GRIEVES

MACKELWAY
Youre sure

FRAN
Theres crystallization in the blood
stream The blood never clotted in the
wound Its a freezer burn Im having
the other body shipped out - the guy from
Trenton Well see if hes got the same
thing

Mackelway pauses thinking

MACKELWAY
So he keeps the bodies in a freezer
then buries them

That was a question He cant do any better

FRAN
I dunno If he kept them in a freezer
theyd have marks like this all over
Wouldnt they

Mackelway nods - that made sense Shit

The noise of the Interstate doesnt make things any easier A
huge TRUCK rumbles by 18 wheels

Mackelway eyes it absently Then a bolt hits him

On the side of the truck is a trademark EVER-FROST This
truck is hauling ice cream

This Diner is big enough to seat 200 truckers a few
families and folks who just like the buffet (gravy covers
just about every entree)

Mackelways been here for hours A WAITRESS comes by

WAITRESS
You want some more breakfast Honey or
are we just rollin right on into lunch

MACKELWAY

MACKELWAY

She half-smiles She likes him despite herself

DINER - MACKELWAY - RESUMING
He half-smiles puts the cel-phone away He likes her despite
himself
Then a MAN passes by him a trucker Lets call him VIC
All we see as he passes is the TATTOO on his forearm a cobra
Keys jingle on his belt-hook He wears a sleeveless down vest
and a God Bless America cap
Mackelway turns but Vics already past us

Something about him attracts Mackelways attention The walk
the attitude Something

So Mackelway is watching - without really knowing why - as Vic
crosses the parking lot heading for his rig Its a beast
Vic climbs in unaware that hes being watched

Mackelway looks away chiding himself for allowing the guy to
distract him That WAITRESS comes by with more coffee
Mackelway smiles looking absently out the window again

And sees a LITTLE BOY of 5 in the cab of Vics rig

But this little boy is SCREAMING struggling to get out of his
car-seat until Vic grabs the kid by the shoulders roughly

all of this visible through the windshield

Mackelway locks in on the kid Holy shit

Vics rig pulls out The kid pounds on his window Looks like
hes saying Lemme out of here I want my Mommy He might be
little Charlie - we cant tell from here

But we can see that Vic is yelling at him Shut up

And we can see that Vics truck is refrigerated Hes hauling
dairy products

On a normal day Mackelway might shrug this off as
coincidence He might not be so vigilant

This isnt a normal day He races for the door

EXT TRUCK-STOP - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Mackelway backs out in the Yukon trying to keep a visual on
Vics truck

ANOTHER 18-WHEELER pulls in front of him blocking his view
entirely

MACKELWAY
Dammit

He honks - loud - pulls around that other 18-wheeler heading
for the exit of the lot

Just spotted Vics rig again

EXT ROADINT MACKELWAYS YUKON - CONTINUING

He follows Vics rig out of the lot and onto a road
approaching I-30 But there are three cars between them -—

Mackelway cant get a clean look at Vics license plate

Vic approaches the Interstate So do the three cars between
them

Vic passes the Interstate on-ramp The three cars turn on to
it putting Mackelway right on Vics tail

He grabs his cel dials This truck has license plates from

ten states

MACKELWAY (INTO CEL)
This is Mackelway I need a run down on a
plate Texas Delta-142-Romeo-Victor-

He puts the cel down but doesnt hang up Vic just made a
turn onto a VAST DIRT LOT

There are RIDES at this carnival Pony rides a ferris wheel
and a huge ring of Barbeques each fired up and cooking Must
be a thousand people in attendance today

Vic parks his rig Mackelway hangs back watching

Vic gets out of the rig From here we can see that that 5-year-
old BOY is still stick in his car seat and he is still

screaming and flailing

Vic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say Behave or
else Then Vic disappears into the crowded carnival

EXT MACKELWAY - AT HIS CAR - RESUMING

He gets out of the Yukon approaching Vics truck We CROSS
THE LOT WITH HIM

He reaches Vics truck looks in the passenger window Theres
the five year-old kid tears streaming down his face (We

still cant tell if its Charlie)

Mackelway reaches for the passenger-side door Its locked Of
course And he cant shoot his way in

He looks to the kid inside

MACKELWAY
You okay

(Kids a blank)
Kid You okay in there

The Kid doesnt respond - just seems spooked Shit
Mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd Vics still
visible to us but he wont be for long

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
(at the Kid)
Ill be back Dont worry

Mackelway heads into the carnival

EXT CARNIVAL - CONTINUING

He begins running now past the table where ladies are selling
TICKETS for the rides and games past the Cotton-Candy Guy
Running because we just lost sight of Vic

Mackelway hurries through that ring of barbeques upsetting a

tray or two Then he stops Theres the ferris wheel Was that
Vic on the other side of it

Mackelway takes off

EXT FERRIS WHEEL - CONTINUING

No Vic But Mackelway thinks he sees the guy heading back
in the direction of the parking lot

He runs past the Pony rides past a funhouse past a popcorn
machine past those ladies selling tickets

EXT PARKING LOT - RESUMING

He hits a bottleneck of people at the entrance But he bursts
through runs into the dirt parking lot around cars and big-
rigs then turns a corner and

runs smack into Benjamin ORyan

The shock is so total it takes each of them a moment to
recover from it But here he is ORyan five feet away

Mackelways speechless still trying to recalibrate himself A
second ago he was chasing a possible Zero Now hes face to
face with ORyan

And ORyan isnt running In fact he almost seems amused
ORYAN

Well well Must be quite a moment for
you Congratulations

Mackelway still hasnt spoken until

MACKELWAY
Whatre you doing here

ORYAN
Waiting for you

which is when Mackelway realizes that he is standing right

in front of Vics rig

But he wasnt expecting what comes next

Vic has returned to the rig with a WOMAN beside him Turns

out shes his WIFE Vic opens the passenger-side door
unclasps that five year-old kid from his seat

FIVE YEAR-OLD
Mommy

The kid dives into the Womans arms

WOMAN
Morning Baby

vIc
I told you shed be here
(to Woman)

Hes been a brat all morning

Mother hugs son which means that Mackelway has misread
things badly

And ORyan is a witness to it - hence the grin
MACKELWAY
(at ORyan)
Hands up

ORyan raises his hands Mackelway reaches for his cuffs

CUT TO

176 EXT CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

ORyans hands are cuffed in front of him Mackelway leads him
to the Yukon opens a door for him and puts him into the
backseat A few LOOKIE-LOUS strain for a peek

177 INT MACKELWAYS YUKON - CONTINUING

Mackelway gets in hits the ignition Reaches for his cel-
phone Starts to dial

ORYAN
(disappointed)
Awfully conventional - dont ya think

Mackelway pauses

MACKELWAY
Huh

ORYAN
Apprehend the fugitive then call it in
for your pat on the head

MACKELWAY
Sorry to disappoint you

Mackelway continues to dial

ORYAN
Ill get over it
(flat)
But Im not too sure that little boy

will
Bang That just stopped Mackelway mid-dial

MACKELWAY
(minor test)
What little boy

ORYAN
The one from the Diner in Denton
MACKELWAY
You know where he is

ORYAN
I can find him

MACKELWAY
How

ORYAN
Same way I found Starkey and Speck and
Fulcher and you

That rang a bell

ORYAN (CONTD)

I need someplace quiet - someplace I can
concentrate And your assurance that
once hes located we go get him
together

MACKELWAY

I cant do that

ORYAN
Then I cant help you

Mackelway disgusted pulls out of the lot

178 INT MACKELWAYS YUKON - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER

Through sparse traffic heading for an Interstate on-ramp
ORYAN (CONTD)
Im talking about uncompromised justice
No trials No lawyers No hiccups ina
chain of evidence that can set a monster
free You of all people should be able to
appreciate the value of that

MACKELWAY
Wheres the boy
ORYAN
I wont be doing this much longer
Actually this is the end of it Ive
(MORE)

ORYAN (CONTD)
come to accept that But there is one
last thing to--

MACKELWAY
(anger rising)
Wheres the boy ORyan

ORYAN
Do we have an understanding

Mackelway pulls the car over under an I-30 overpass and
out comes his gun pointed right at ORyans forehead

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Enough of this shit Wheres the boy

ORyan cant help it Hes pleased

ORYAN
Good This is good Sort of thing youd
never find in a procedural manual It
tells me I was right about you

MACKELWAY
(cocking the hammer)
I will kill you ORyan

ORYAN
I know But we have work to do first

MACKELWAY
Wheres the Goddamn kid

Silence Then that CEL-PHONE rings Must be Fran

ORYAN
Dont pick that up

Mackelway eyes him are you kidding It rings again

ORYAN (CONTD)
(a panicked offer)
This is the guy who put all those pins in
that map of yours And I can take you to
him

Ring 3 Mackelway grabs the phone

MACKELWAY
Fine Where is he
(silence)
Where is he

Silence punctuated by Ring 4 Then ORyan smiles and
points to his own forehead

ORYAN
Right here

Mackelway lets out a disgusted sigh

MACKELWAY
Fuck you

He punches the Talk button taking his eyes off ORyan fora
split second

What follows is a blur
ORyan lunges forward like an animal throwing his cuffed
wrists over Mackelways head yanking Mackelway out of his

seat with a violent tug The gun falls

We POP OUTSIDE THE YUKON pulling back obscuring our view
of whats going on inside that truc

That cel-phone continues to ring We keep pulling back
under this sparsely-trafficked overpass rain falling

The cel-phone stops ringing CONTINUE PULLING BACK taking in
the expanse of highway - cars rolling by without a hint of the
peril beneath them

CUT TO
INT TRUCK-STOP - DINER - GREENVILLE - SAME (DAY)
Fran has just arrived She scans the place Doesnt see
Mackelway Great She reaches for that cel-phone again

CUT TO
INT A THIRD UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Mackelway awakens The room feels like its swimming His arms

and legs are bound His mouth has been GAGGED

And he is staring into his own REFLECTION
He lies on his side A MIRROR has been propped on the floor
just inches from his face - leaving him with nothing to look
at but himself

He strains against the ropes but theres no give to them
Hes helpless powerless And that mirror is forcing him to
watch it all with perfect clarity

A few feet away ORyan sits in a chair calmly peeling the
skin off of an apple with that huge HUNTING KNIFE of his A
CANDLE flickers on the floor by his feet

ORYAN
Are you afraid

There was a delight to that question - we can see it on
ORyans face Mackelway of course cant reply due to the
gag But the answers obvious

ORYAN (CONTD)

(quoting himself as Daitz)
Imagine a killer with no patterns no
tell-tale fetishes no rituals of any
kind No hidden desire to be caught A
perfect vessel of evil

All Mackelway can see is his own reflection - the fear in his
eyes - bouncing off a mirror thats only inches away

ORYAN (CONTD)
And the name we give that killer is
Zero
(again)
Are you afraid

Slowly he lowers the knife into the flame of that candle on
the floor It GLOWS Good God

ORYAN (CONTD)
td be customary at this point to start
praying I hear a lot of that Havent
seen too many answers though I wouldnt
hold my breath waiting for another
janitor to break in here and save you
either Youre alone

Mackelway tries to speak Its impossible

ORyan pulls the GAG from his mouth just long enough for
Mackelway to say

MACKELWAY
Wheres the boy

ORyan jams the gag back into his mouth angrily

ORYAN
(re the mirror)
My my Must be extremely satisfying to
watch yourself say something so heroic
Im almost envious
(MORE)

ORYAN (CONTD)
(casually)
The boys under the bed In pieces Are
you afraid

Mackelway absorbs that - watches himself absorb it - then
looks to that bed Cant quite see whats under it

ORyan eyes the flames as they dance over the blade

With that

ORYAN (CONTD)

know what youre thinking There is
pain coming Am I going to take it like a
man Let me put you at ease You wont
None of them do Men women children
They all weep they all beg They pass
out they piss themselves They attempt
negotiation You wouldnt believe how
many men have lain right where youre
lying right now - grown men with wives
and children back home - offering all
inds of sexual gratification in exchange
for a five minute reprieve Its
pathetic Are you afraid

(of course no reply)
Then theres that moment when they
realize theres nothing left to be
negotiated Theyre just mine And
theyre helpless And the look in their
eyes the level of surrender well
its almost pornographic I put this
mirror here because I dont want you to
miss it Are you afraid

he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame It

is
RED-HOT Even looking at it is painful
But Mackelway cant look at anything else

ORYAN (CONTD)
How about now

Just like that that red-hot knife is an inch from Mackelways
face The heat alone makes his head jerk back Wisps of smoke
rise from its edge

And Mackelway is forced to watch his own reaction to it

He struggles against these ropes to no use A guttural sound
comes out of him

ORYAN (CONTD)
Are you afraid

ORyans hand lashes out a bit leaving the sizzling knife
just under Mackelways chin The anticipation of pain is
unbearable And Mackelway is reading it in his own eyes

ORYAN (CONTD)
Hmmm Agent Mackelway Are you

Two things hit at once 1) This monster is about to torture me
to death 2) Please God dont let me give him the
satisfaction of seeing me cry

ORyan moves the blade again this time an eighth of an inch
above Mackelways right arm The heat from it is so incendiary
that Mackelways shirt begins to smoke

ORYAN (CONTD)
Are you

Mackelways shirt is officially on fire now The pain is
awful He stares at his own reflection

as tears begin to flow from his eyes He cant stop them
ORYAN (CONTD)
(top of his lungs)

Are you afraid

That bounces off the walls Mackelway shuts his eyes tight -
cant watch this anymore
ORYAN (CONTD)
(infuriated)
Open your eyes Open your eyes Goddammit
or Ill cut the fucking lids off

Mackelway opens his eyes forced to watch himself break Deep
sobs shudder through him as

ORyan digs that red-hot blade into Mackelways arm
ORYAN (CONTD)
ARE YOU AFRAID

Mackelway sees the answer in his own reflection Yes I am
terrified He SHRIEKS the sound muffled by that gag

With his body able to do no more than spasm he jerks his head
forward smashing it into that mirror THE MIRROR SHATTERS
obliterating the image

and everything goes black

Then MORE IMAGES SWARM AT US Were helpless to beat them
back

180a EXT DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME
180a

Out of a soupy darkness a dreamlike spin on a location weve
visited before It is the wheat field that ORyan has Remote
Viewed countless times Only this time we see it through

Mackelways fever or nightmare We see the tall wheat the
wet wind - familiar images to us All to the pounding Chant of
the Navaho

But then OTHER IMAGES enter this world Theyre jarring

-That TRIBESMAN eyes rolling back foaming the mouth
dancing around a fire in a frenzy Then a curtain of wheat
obscures him revealing

-Fran and Katie giggling crooking fingers as if inviting
us Looks like theyre naked But as we approach them they
seem to get farther away Then that curtain of wheat that
separates us from them reveals

-Charlton extending a hand to us warmly congratulating us
for something a job well done when

Mackelway himself is hunting through the wet wheat gun drawn
He FIRES Then looks to see who hes just shot
A body He turns it over

and is staring at himself lying dead on the ground in the
mud and pouring rain It is a moment of shock and horror
giving way as we

181 FADE UP AGAIN

»on ORyan - at a desk sitting upright making notes ona
pad Calm Businesslike His back turned to us

182 INT THAT UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT

Time has passed We dont know how much Or maybe were dead
or dreaming Its hard to say

But theres ORyan at a desk Writing

Mackelways eyes are open His FOREHEAD has a bright red
raspberry on it from smashing into that mirror

But the brain is functioning It starts running through a
check-list

Im in the same motel room Im on a bed Im alive Theres
ORyan Everything hurts No its just my right arm But it
is searing

The check-list continues my mouth is sore but that GAG has
been removed

And MY ARMS ARE UNBOUND Legs too Maybe I am dead

Mackelway tries to move his hand It takes some effort
Everythings foggy But he puts it before his face Turns it
Flexes it Squeezes it His hand He stares at it

Then he notices his SHOULDER A fat BANDAGE has been wrapped
around it - covering up the source of that searing pain Looks
as though a nurse had tended to it

But this sure as hell isnt a hospital

Then ORyan turns facing us Mackelway recoils without
meaning to

But ORyans demeanor has changed That look of possessed
malevolence - its gone now We cant imagine why

ORYAN
(softly)
Stand up

Mackelway pauses rewinding that one

ORYAN (CONTD)
Its over now Can you stand

Mackelway is still bracing for torture or at least combat So
hes a step behind

ORYAN (CONTD)
We really do have to go

ORyan rises crossing toward us Even unbound Mackelway is
expecting another onslaught But all ORyan does is drop a
piece of paper onto Mackelways lap

Its another DRAWING of a RANCH-HOUSE with a windmill in the
background Crude but just specific enough Mackelways still
too unwound to speak

ORYAN (CONTD)
This is where hell be With the boy
(a beat)
Zero Hes coming home today Were going
to be there

Mackelways starting to understand now This was an act An
initiation That stuns him
ORYAN (CONTD)

Youre ready to come with me now Youve

been in the pit Stand up
Mackelway eyes him - utter disbelief
ORyan smiles warmly - like a Drill Sergeant at the end of
Basic Sorry I was so hard on you but it had to be done Can
we shake on it

Instead Mackelway simply EXPLODES

It is a blur faster than a blur but Mackelway rises with an
animal roar knocking ORyan flat on his back
Then Mackelway is upon him

All the helplessness all the horror the images of watching
himself in that mirror the sounds of his own uncontrollable
sobbing they ERUPT now into violence

It is an overwhelming force ORyan cant begin to fight it
off Mackelway has one hand on ORyans throat The other hand
comes down like a sledgehammer

One blow Then another The sounds coming out of Mackelway are
savage barely human Hes out of control

ORyans eyes roll back Mackelway now puts both hands around
this fuckers throat Hes going to kill him - right here
Hes going to squeeze the life from him

This is a Mackelway weve never met before His eyes are wild
hateful - even as the last gasps of breath rasp their way out

of ORyans throat

Then Mackelway is distracted for just a second No Less than
a second by a glimpse of that SHATTERED MIRROR - his own

twisted image

He looks away from it refusing to be distracted determined
to kill this guy

then those eyes drift back to the mirror again

and he sees his reflection a hardened crazed stranger An
animal

His hands without warning release their grip

ORyan gasps for air His face has been bloodied Mackelway
rises disgusted removing a great weight from ORyans chest
That makes breathing a little easier

Mackelway crosses to a tiny cheap BATHROOM

183 INT MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUING

Mackelway enters Theres a mirror in here too That fat
BANDAGE on his shoulder stares back at him

He tugs at it - doesnt unravel it just yanks it off his arm -
revealing a hideous wound

Its a ZERO WITH A SLASH THROUGH IT

Now everything clicks ORyan was branding him Initiating him
with that red-hot knife

Mackelway stares at the wound his eyes lifeless He splashes
some water on his face his mind still reeling

Then ORyan appears in the doorway He too looks like hell -
face bloodied throat red eyes watering A long beat

Mackelway eyes him incredulous ORyan nods then places that
DRAWING of the Ranch-House on the sink Mackelway eyes it

Then ORyan stuns him by laying Mackelways GUN atop the
drawing without a word

Mackelway eyes the gun then grabs it and points it right at
ORyans face just inches away

Were TIGHT on Mackelways hand It trembles with rage

But ORyan looking right down the barrel seems unafraid In
fact he smiles utterly confident Then

ORYAN
(re gun)
Soon I promise But not yet

He eases Mackelways hand down thus lowering the gun Then
ORyan turns grabs Mackelways car keys and heads for the
front door

Mackelway stands rigid He raises the gun Maybe Ill just
shoot this fucker in the back

Then those IMAGES come at us again out of nowhere

EXT WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT

Out of a gray soupy swirl - coming slightly into focus Wet
wind tall wheat our own heavy BREATHING as we run And
that non-descript voice we heard echoing earlier becomes the
sound of ORyans voice static-filled wobbling

ORYAN (0S)
Please Im begging you
That was clear enough A gun rises We seem to be holding
it

Then those images vanish and we are jolted back to

185 INT MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - RESUMING

Mackelway tightens ORyans out the door This VISION that
keeps getting clearer and clearer What the hell does this
it mean

Down go two more Vicodens

Cut TO

186 INT MACKELWAYS YUKON - DRIVING - NIGHT

A huge STORM devours scenery on both sides of us ORyan
drives Mackelway sits no expression at all on his face
still recovering from what happened in that room

Silence Then

MACKELWAY
Tell me about Icarus

ORYAN
Why

MACKELWAY
Just wanna know

ORyan eyes him The sky is black

ORYAN
There were five of us In the program

Mackelways all ears
ORYAN (CONTD)
Wed come in in the morning have a cup
of coffee talk about the Yankees Then
youd go to your room with your pen and

(MORE)

ORYAN (CONTD)
your pad of paper always alone and
youd try to lock in Son of Sam John
Wayne Gacy Ted Bundy He might be
driving his car or having a beer or
brushing his teeth or cutting
someones eyes out

That was said flatly matter-of-factly Its chilling

He pauses

ORYAN (CONTD)

If you did it right you got all of it
The way it sounded The way it smelled
Those people were looking up at you
begging you for mercy It was like being
God

(a beat)
except youre not Because you cant
do a thing for them Cant make it stop
Youre just watching helpless

ORYAN (CONTD)
They wired us into this current the five
of us darkness the pit itself We were
plugged right into it But nobody taught
us how to shut it off

(thinking back)

We were just men And we saw things men
shouldnt see Agony torture evil - and
it never shut off Even now its still
there

MACKELWAY
They all wind up like you The other
agents

ORYAN
No Theyre dead now

Oh Mackelway doesnt reply

ORYAN (CONTD)
They broke down Then they opted out
(Mackelways a blank)
Killed themselves After a while those
conversations about the Yankees became
impossible Ya see

Mackelway lets that sink in as he stares at passing head-

lights Then
MACKELWAY
Im sorry

ORyan shrugs He appreciates it The windshield wipers beat
back rain

CUT TO

187 INT MACKELWAYS YUKON - DRIVING - LATER NIGHT

ORyan continues to drive Silence hangs Then

ORYAN
Were here

Mackelway sits up ORyan pulls over at

188 EXT RANCH-HOUSE - GREENVILLE TEXAS - CONTINUING

Weve seen this place before That is weve seen it in
ORyans DRAWING which lies on the dashboard before us A
ranch-style house with a WINDMILL in the backyard

ORyan pulls over Rain pounds on the roof and hood Wind
blows Mackelway studies the house Then his eyes shift
briefly to the drawing

MACKELWAY
Cant bring you in with me You know
that
ORyan shrugs then raises his hands Cuff me

The CUFFS are lying on the floor in the back seat Mackelway
reaches back to grab them a golden opportunity for ORyan
to club the guy

But ORyan remains still Mackelway grabs them Then he stops
Simply has to ask

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Those faxes the Have-You-Seen-Mes
How many of em is he actually
responsible for

ORyan lays it right out

ORYAN
All of em

Mackelway nods sobered Cuffs ORyan to the steering wheel
and approaches the house

EXT RANCH HOUSE - WALKWAY - CONTINUING
The place is in some disrepair untended lawn chipping paint
etc Mackelway looks through the kitchen window

No ones visible He walks around the side of the house

INT MACKELWAYS YUKON - RESUMING

ORyan watches as Mackelway vanishes This is a moment of
opportunity With his free hand he reaches into his pocket
grabbing a lighter

EXT RANCH HOUSE - SIDE - CONTINUING

Mackelway moves cautiously being pelted by rain But now he
can see inside the Living Room of this home

Its a bit of a time warp plastic on the furniture an old
radiator pictures on the mantle in antique frames

And an OLD LADY leaning over a record player

Tough to hear whats playing - were outside and that storm
is pounding - but it sounds like Glenn Miller Theres also an
old tv in here Wizard of Oz is on it

The lady is 70 frail thin She also happens to be BLIND
Cataracts on her eyes Her names DELIA Mackelway watches
her as she exits the room heading for the kitchen

He moves to another window
INT MACKELWAYS YUKON - RESUMING
ORyan keeping his eyes on that house now lights the

lighter and holds the flame up to the CHAIN connecting his
hand-cuff to the one on the steering wheel

The chain begins to heat up

EXT SIDE OF THE HOUSE - RESUMING

Mackelway watches as Delia makes her way into the kitchen

It too is from another era the dishwasher stands in the
center of the floor connected to the sink with a long hose
The refrigerator the table the toaster - all old

The oven is an antique too Delia crosses to it grabs a
towel opens it and pulls a CAKE from it

She brings the cake to the kitchen table moving well for a
lady who cant see On the table is an old-fashioned bakers
frosting tube

She grabs it using her hands to orient herself and begins
to write on the cake in frosting Slowly

Mackelway cant see the top of that cake but we can The
first letters in beautiful cursive read Happy Bir Its

a work in progress

INT MACKELWAYS YUKON - RESUMING

ORyan has that handcuff chain GLOWING now We dont know if
hell have time to break the thing until

The passenger-side door is opened abruptly

MACKELWAY
Its his birthday isnt it

ORyan turns Heres Mackelway who now gets an eyeful of what
ORyans doing with that lighter

ORyan pockets it a bit sheepishly Mackelway decides to
ignore the whole thing

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
He comes home on his birthday

ORyan nods Then Delias front door swings open

DELIA (0S)

(aloud delighted)
Darling That you

EXT RANCH HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING

Delia stands in the open doorway an old blind lady talking
to the dark rainy street That confuses them

until we hear the rumble of an 18-WHEEL TRUCK
It turns a corner onto this street Mackelway turns now

Weve seen this truck before A monstrous rolling beast And
Mackelway straightens reaching for his sidearm Behind him
Delia smiles excitedly almost dancing

But that smile soon leaps from her face as she hears the
sound of that 18-wheeler BRAKING ABRUPTLY its tires locking-
up on the wet road

Mackelway gets a look at the DRIVER now - a wiry sinewy man
of 35 Lets call him ZERO

Their eyes lock - until Zero throws his rig into gear again
and begins to rumble down the street

DELIA (CONTD)
(confused)
Daryl Honey

No answer That truck is rumbling away Mackelway turns
racing for the Yukon leaving Delia at the door

INT MACKELWAYS YUKON - CONTINUING

Mackelway jumps in to the Yukon unlocking those cuffs

MACKELWAY
Drive

He accidentally burns himself on the super-heated chain
MACKELWAY (CONTD)
(re burn)

Fuck

Cuffs are unlocked now ORyan starts up the Yukon

EXT GREENVILLE STREETS - DRIVING - CONTINUING

ORyan drives pursuing the big-rig Mackelway gets on his cel-
phone dials Rain falls in SHEETS all around them

MACKELWAY (INTO CEL-PHONE)

(urgently)
This is Mackelway Im travelling north
on Grove Road approaching I-30 in

Greenville Request immediate back-up
Pursuing a suspect in a refrigerated
truck Texas license plate Alpha--

The Yukon swerves hard to the right narrowly avoiding the
tail end of Zeros rig as he swings it into our path
Mackelway drops the phone Grabs it again

MACKELWAY (PHONE CONTD)
Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha

Zero does it again - swinging the rear of his rig across the
road forcing ORyan to swerve hard The Yukon gets shoved on
to a curb then clunks down to the street again

Then Zero jams on the brakes Mackelways eyes go wide

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
(at ORyan)
Brakes

ORyan jumps on the brakes The Yukon screeches to a stop
throwing itself into a sideways slide It bangs passenger
side first into the rear of the truck breaking a window

Mackelway ducks out of the way of breaking glass Then the rig
pulls away again ORyan follows

THE CHASE - CONTINUING

Zeros rig turns hard onto a SERVICE ROAD running parallel to
the Interstate Mackelway is locked in on that truck

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
(into cel-phone again)
Travelling due west now Dont see a
name Its a service road running
parallel to the--

Then Mackelway freezes mid-word He just saw something that
made his jaw drop

On the other side of this road is a field of TALL WHEAT

Time seems to stop His blood feels like it just congealed
Tall wheat in a wet wind He has been here before He has seen
it before

And so has ORyan

Mackelway just stares slack-jawed as that wheat whips past
them The feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he
forgets about Zero and the rig and the kid

Everything has just crystallized in a horrible way He knows
that he is going to wind up in that wheat field somehow with
ORyan

And ORyan will be begging him for mercy Please

ORyan guns the Yukon attempting to cut in front of the rig
Zero swings wide sending the Yukon into a curb this time
That shreds their front tire

which means that in one minute this car is going to be
undriveable So if they dont stop Zero from hitting that
Interstate - now - Zero will be gone

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
(absently)
Whatre you

ORYAN
Cant let him hit the Interstate

Mackelway braces himself as ORyan guns his car up the left
side of the rig shredded tire and all Then

He pulls right in front of the rig At about 60 mph And he
jams on the brakes

Zero swerves out of instinct It throws the rig into a
vicious JACK-KNIFE The van whips around in front of the cab
swatting the Yukon away like a fly

Were inside the Yukon as it rolls Mackelway and ORyan look

like tinker toys

The torque pulls Zeros rig onto its side sliding hard Metal
hits concrete sending up a shower of SPARKS

The Yukon winds up in a ditch alongside the service road
upside down Mackelway alive and awake strains to look out
the busted windshield

What he sees is hard to discern - but it looks like Zeros rig
is lying flat on its side

And of course he is mere yards from that wheat field

EXT SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUING

The rigs cab lies drivers-side down But the passenger-side
door pops open And Zero pokes through it his eyes
immediately scanning that TALL WHEAT Rain pours

Mackelways watching ORyan who blacked out for a second now
opens his eyes getting the picture in a hurry

Zero leaps to the ground rolls and rises Only thing in his
hand is a TIRE IRON Carrying it he sprints into the wheat
field - vanishing

Mackelway bursts out of the Yukon in pursuit ORyans door
is stuck Mackelway doesnt stop to help him - just barrels
across the street

Just then - a STATE RANGER CAR arrives

MACKELWAY
(over his shoulder running)
Get the van open Hes got a kid in the
van

STATE RANGER hurries out of his squad car Mackelway sprints
into the tall wheat

ORyan with a grunt gets his door open Now he too
disappears into that Wheat Field

EXT WHEAT FIELD - CONTINUING

Tall wheat in a stiff wet wind and not a drop of moonlight to
guide us Mackelway plunges in gun drawn No idea where hes
going

except hes been here before Hes seen it And there is a
feeling of inevitability to all this its haunting

Hes practically blind in here Cant see five feet in front
of him Nothing but the sound of his own breathing

That too was presaged Those visions

201 EXT ZEROS TOPPLED RIG - CONTINUING

Its locked Ranger pulls out his handgun and blows the lock
away

202 EXT WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING

Mackelway keeps running deaf and blind

ORyan is running nearby but they cant see or hear one
another

203 INT THE TOPPLED RIG - REFRIGERATED VAN - RESUMING

200 sides of beef lie on their sides Ranger plunges in

Then the Ranger spots in the back of the van a FALSE-WALL
that used to hide a secret compartment

The crash has collapsed part of the false-wall Frozen air
blows out in wisps He climbs over those carcasses fast as he

204 EXT WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING

Mackelway keeps going running blind

Then another sound up ahead Sounds like the noise of
someone stumbling Mackelway stops Listens
Silence The sound does not repeat itself

He continues along step by cautious step now

INT TOPPLED RIG - REFRIGERATED VAN - RESUMING
Ranger gets over the last of the carcasses pulling himself up
to the now-open compartment

First thing we see is a REFRIGERATION ROD the one that was
responsible for those freezer burns

Then we see Charlie bound Hes trembling with cold but hes
alive His leg presses up against the rod

EXT WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING
Mackelway inching along heart pounding He hears a noise to
his left Whips around gun poised

But its nothing He sighs The wheat almost sounds like its
laughing at him

Then that TIRE IRON lashes out from the right

It catches Mackelway with horrific force shattering his wrist
and sending that gun flying into the wheat

Before Mackelway can react Zero is upon him

EXT THE TOPPLED RIG - RESUMING

Frans Ford skids to a stop outside the van

just as the Ranger brings Charlie out of the rig The kid
is shaking traumatized He begins to cry

Fran gets the idea She hurries over

EXT WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING

Mackelway and Zero wrestle surrounded and obscured by all of
that wheat Zero is a monster and hes got that tire iron
Mackelway has a busted wrist Hardly a fair fight

But Mackelway is battling kicking clawing getting in as
many shots as he can His shirt rips away from his body

exposing that brand-mark They roll back and forth Until

ORYAN (0S)
(calmly firmly)
Up

Zero freezes Mackelway too They turn to find
ORyan who stands here Mackelways gun in hand

ORYAN (CONTD)
Up

Mackelways relief is total He pushes Zero away rising Zero
pulls himself off the ground chagrinned

ZERO
(re Mackelway)
Glad youre here Man Guy was about to
kill me

ORyan without ceremony puts a bullet through Zeros left
palm That got Mackelways attention

Zero howls with pain his palm gushing The TIRE-IRON falls to
the ground Mackelway approaches ORyan

MACKELWAY
Ill take it from here

He extends his good hand to ORyan The gun ORyan pauses
Then

ORYAN
Are you going to shoot him

MACKELWAY
Give me the gun ORyan

ZERO
Hey I just surrendered

ORYAN
Shut up

ZERO
I surrendered Thats it

ORYAN
SHUT UP

ORyan wheels around aiming the gun right at Zeros face
That shuts the guy up in a hurry

From that service road now we hear a line of SIRENS
approaching from a distance Unit after unit

ORYAN (CONTD)

(quietly now)
Look at him Mack Hes not human
anymore Go dig up that old ladys
backyard - youll find bodies there
Maybe hundreds of them Of course ya
gotta get a warrant first chain of
custodys gotta be followed One breach
and he walks

(no reply)
My way hes eliminated the world is rid
of him Its a lot closer to justice than
having some Prosecutor tell you youve
left a tissue sample in the wrong lab
Isnt it

MACKELWAY
(that stung)
Give me the fucking gun

ORyan turns studies him
and hands him the gun Just like that

Mackelway eyes it ORyan doesnt say a word just crosses
back to Zero and grabs that TIRE-IRON off the ground

ORyans now standing right behind Zero as

ORYAN
(at Mackelway)
You have to understand none of this was
arbitrary We were chosen you and I
WHAP ORyan just swung that tire-iron into Zeros rib cage
We hear bones crack and air rushing from the guys lungs He
drops to his knees gasping

ORYAN (CONTD)
I saw us here You did too
THUMP Another violent swing of that tire-iron busting up the
other side of Zeros torso Now both sides of his rib-cage
have shattered Breathing is almost impossible

Mackelway tightens His head just began to throb

MACKELWAY
Okay You made your point

ORYAN
Bullshit If Id made my fucking point
you wouldve shot him yourself by now

Another swing of that tire-iron across the back of Zeros
neck He crumbles face down

Fuck it Mackelway crosses to ORyan and puts that gun right
up against the back of ORyans head

MACKELWAY
Enough

Then an odd thing ORyan simply smiles

Something about having that gun pointed right at him - its a
relief

MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Drop it

ORYAN
Or what

MACKELWAY
Just drop it

ORYAN
Would you shoot me

Thats something Mackelway doesnt want to consider

MACKELWAY
Put it down

ORYAN

(calmly)
I want you to think for a second About
your destiny Who you are Youre cursed
like I am - except you keep running from
it

(Mackelways silent)
You hear things You see things Thats
why you cant sleep why your head always
aches

He turns They are face to face Nothing but that gun between
them

ORYAN (CONTD)
and its why you are going to let me
kill this animal And then youre going
to kill me

That threw Mackelway badly ORyan seizes the moment -
wheeling around

He takes one last swing at Zero like a lumberjack The tire-
iron impacts Zeros skull with a dull THUD cracking it He is
dead

Mackelways eyes go wide Whole thing has been a blur

ORyan releases the tire-iron and drops to his knees like a
man awaiting execution his back to Mackelway

Mackelway is silent Stunned The blood from Zeros caved-in
skull finds its way to ORyans knees

But ORyan remains peaceful Calm Ready

MACKELWAY
Get up

ORYAN
I cant do that Mack Ive seen all this
already For months now

MACKELWAY
Get up

ORYAN
Every time were in this field same
wind same rain And you

He puts a finger to his head pretending its a gun Then he
pretends to pull the trigger Mackelway gets the idea

ORYAN (CONTD)
Its okay I want you to Im begging you
to

Mackelway doesnt know what to do Then making matters worse

FRAN (0S)
(aloud)
Mack

Shes about a hundred yards away but shell be here
enough That puts some heat under ORyan

ORYAN
Im tired Mack

FRAN (0S)
Can you hear me

Shes 90 yards out now

ORYAN
Pull the trigger
(no reply)

Im not going to jail Now pull the
fucking trigger

Mackelways frozen ORyan knows it

ORYAN (CONTD)
Fucking coward

ORyan rises now facing Mackelway

ORYAN (CONTD)
Some things are not up to us to decide
They just exist Theyre inevitable This
field This rain This moment It has all
already happened You know that Youve
seen it too

He shoves Mackelway in the chest

FRAN (0S)
Mack

Shes 70 yards out now

ORYAN
Shut it off for me

MACKELWAY
Im not going to kill you ORyan

ORYAN
Of course you will Ive seen it

MACKELWAY
You saw wrong

ORYAN
(incredulous)
Thats impossible

FRAN (0S)
Mack Can you hear me

50 yards out now Maybe close enough to hear ORyans voice

ORYAN
(rambling unraveling)
You dont understand Those fucking faces
(MORE)

ORYAN (CONTD)

on that map They call to me I see their
eyes in the dark - theyre staring at me
How did you let this happen to me But
thats the thing about them - theyre
like pictures They never blink They
juststare and always at me Thats my
destiny do you see I didnt help them
when they needed me and this is my
penance Fine I ACCEPT IT But Im
opting out now ya get it I cant stand
this anymore I wanna close my eyes for
once and see something other than
torture

(Mackelways expressionless)
Its not a bad start Mack Weve made
the world a little safer now Speck
Fulcher Starkey now Zero Weve made
justice But I get some too You have to
end all this for me Thats why youre
here Its your destiny

MACKELWAY
Stop telling me about my fucking destiny

ORYAN
(again)
But Ive seen it

MACKELWAY
Open your eyes ORyan Here I am
standing here Im not shooting you
Doesnt that fucking tell you something
Youre a guy with a skill Period They
taught you more than they shouldve Im

sorry about that But youre not God
You cant see everything
ORYAN

Yes I can And you can too Thats why I
chose you

FRAN (0S)
Mack

Mackelways not budging ORyan can see that

ORYAN
(re tire-iron)
Fine Ill make it easy for you

ORyan picks up that tire-iron Mackelway sees whats coming
ORyan swings the tire-iron as Mackelway backs out of its
range

MACKELWAY
Put the fucking thing down ORyan

ORyan keeps pursuing Another swing Mackelway keeps backing
up The swing misses

ORYAN
Look Its perfect Wont even need a
hearing this way You apprehended the
suspect in the commission of a murder
Then he turned on you and you fired in
self-defense

ORyan isnt letting up And Mackelway cant quite fire

ORYAN (CONTD)
These things are bigger than you -
havent you seen that yet Destiny
Justice Mercy Theyre vast Were just
puppets

MACKELWAY
Im not going to kill you

ORYAN
You dont get to decide that
MACKELWAY
Yes I do

ORyan takes one more swing as

FRAN (0S)
FREEZE

Silence Mackelway turns So does ORyan

Theres Fran emerging from the tall wheat gun trained right
on ORyan His shock is total

FRAN (CONTD)
Drop it

ORyan doesnt move at first Then slowly an ironic smile
snakes its way across his lips

ORYAN
(at Mackelway surprised)
Its funny I never saw anyone else out
here Did you
Mackelway doesnt answer He cant ORyan eyes him

ORYAN (CONTD)
Do it Mack Please
(Mackelways silent)
Please Im begging you

There it was the very thing Mackelways been hearing all this
time the exact words Unsettling as hell

and we begin to INTERCUT images of this moment with images
from those VISIONS that have been hinting at this very
wheatfield since Page One

208a INTERCUT WITHEXT WHEATFIELD FANTASY - SAME 208a
Tall wheat wet wind ORyans voice Im begging you

Mackelway snaps himself out of the vision

MACKELWAY
I cant

That was almost an attempt to make those images stop to deny
its awful inevitable conclusion
MACKELWAY (CONTD)
Im not you

ORYAN
Yet

Two men neither of them flinching until ORyan nods - as
if to say Good-bye

-more of that vision interrupts now a gun rising

ORyan rears back and swings that tire-iron right at
Mackelways head

Fran has no choice She fires

ORyan is hit right between the shoulder blades The tire-iron
hits Mackelway in the shoulder ORyan crumbles to the ground
landing face up

a body slumping to the ground ORyan Mackelway stands
over him

Now real-life again Mackelway stands over ORyan just as
ORyan had always envisioned it That makes him smile even as
hes dying

ORYAN (CONTD)
(weak)
Thank you

Then he dies eyes open Mackelway looks to Fran
DISSOLVE TO

209 EXT SERVICE ROAD - DAWN

Hours have passed Dozens of LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES have
arrived Sherrifs Feds Zeros rig remains on its side

Mackelway sits nearby on a CURB his shattered wrist is ina
SLING Up above the CLOUDS have parted Morning sun streaks
through No more rain Fran sits beside him

At their feet in the gutter of this service road lies a
discarded MILK CARTON covered with dust The face under the
Have You Seen Me is unknown to us

Kathleen is nearby holding Charlie tight Cops surround them

An UNMARKED SEDAN arrives Charlton hurries out of it making
a bee-line for Mackelway

CHARLTON
Nice work
(Mackelway half-nods)
Where is he

MACKELWAY
Sir

CHARLTON
ORyan Where is he

Mackelway rises studies Charlton Theres nothing to say

So he extends a hand to Fran She takes it rising to her
feet They leave Charlton behind

We PULL AWAY from them craning up taking in this expanse of
tall wheat TILTING UP to that morning sun

MATCH DISSOLVE TO
an AFTERNOON SUN now - blazing white hot TILT DOWN

EXT DELIAS RANCH-HOUSE - DAY

Were some distance away HEAT RISES off parched Earth
lending a vaporous screen to everything But we can make out
the shapes of men in HAZ-MAT SUITS

Delias backyard is being torn up by a BACK-HOE Looks like a
war-zone BODIES wrapped in cloth being exhumed from the
ground Dozens of them

But theres plenty of soil yet to be turned Might be
HUNDREDS unearthed by the time these guys are through We
