EXT TRAINING GROUND WESTMINSTER barracks LONDON - Day

Through a veil of dust we see two lines of uniformed cavalry
stretched out across the parade ground Theres a tense silence except
for the occasional flourish of hooves A horseman steps out of each
line

LIEUTENANTS HARRY FEVERSHAM and JOHN DURRANCE face each other across
the wide expanse Already we feel the keen sense of competition
between them DURRANCE raises his sabre first His horse sets off at a
slow trot His troops follow in perfect time HARRY waits a moment
then raises his own sword A sea of sabres rises up in response

The two lines approach each other at a steady canter A smile of
anticipation lights up DURRANCEs face Hes a born soldier enjoying
himself HARRY looks more nervous Hes not as easy as Durrance in the
saddle Its a skill hes acquired over the years rather than been
born to

DURRANCE seems to sense Harrys doubt With a loud whoop he kicks his
horse into a gallop and points his sabre forwards His troops echo his
war cry and descend on the opposing line at speed HARRY checks his
troops and responds The two lines bear down on each other hooves
thundering sabres pointed

DURRANCE charges recklessly His eyes are fixed on Harry all the time
HARRY holds his gaze but doesnt look as sure of himself Hes
thinking too much trying too hard His horse senses it and slows a
fraction The troops behind him lose their cohesion as they draw
level

DURRANCE sees the momentary lapse and waves his men on at full tilt
They pass through HARRYs troops in a perfect line panicking their
mounts cheering triumphantly HARRYs formation loses its shape
Theres no doubt whos won the drill DURRANCE wheels his horse around
and grins at HARRY through the clouds of dust

CREDITS ROLL

INT Changing room WESTMINSTER BARRACKS - day
Moving through clouds of steam we see the CAVALRY OFFICERS washing
themselves in wooden bathtubs Theres a din of voices soldiers re-
living the days drill those on Durrances side still crowing over
their victory

DURRANCE walks with his arm around HARRY With them is another friend
LIEUTENANT TRENCH a squat bull of a man

DURRANCE

How many does that make it Harry
harry

DURRANCE

How many Trench

TRENCH grabs HARRY in a neck hold He lets go as he spots another
friend of theirs LIEUTENANT CASTELTON sitting in a bathtub staring
out TRENCH sneaks up on CASTELTON and ducks his head under the
water CASTELTON comes up spluttering He reaches for a bar of soap
and hurls it after TRENCH

CASTELTON

INT WILLOUGHBYs rooms barracks - day

A fifth friend LIEUTENANT WILLOUGHBY stares at himself in the

DURRANCEs eyes take in the smallest details now Even though he cant
hear a word the scene before him reveals itself more and more
clearly

An obstacle course of a different kind The CAVALRY are training

dummies

blade free Even though its only a training exercise his panic is

smile He turns to GENERAL HOLMBY

COLONEL HAMILTON

General Holmby Sir

GENERAL HOLMBY a severe looking military man stands and faces the
OFFICERS Their eyes are lit-up with anticipation all except Harry
who stares ahead slowly turning inward

GENERAL HOLMBY
Id like to apologise for not giving you men more notice I know
many of you will find it hard to see your families now Unfortunately

we had no alternative

He turns to the map and points out the Sudanese desert
gENERAL HOLMBY

Three days ago an army of Egyptian reserves led by General Hicks
was ambushed at Tashgil by the Mahdis forces Upoun attack the
Egyptians fled leaving General Hicks and the British Officers with
him to fight a heroic but in the end hopeless rearguard action All
of them died sword in hand

HARRY stares out silently his whole world turned upside down
geNERAL HOLMBY
I hesitate to call this a mission of vengeance but the honour of

our country is at stake This Government has finally seen fit to send
its own troops to war

Theres loud cheering from the men now regimental pride and bravado
covering any trace of nerves

HARRY laughs with the others hiding his mounting anxiety
INT HARRY and DURRANCEs ROOM BARRACKS - NIGHT

Laughter filters into Harry and Durrances room The two of them lie
in their beds watching the embers die out in the fireplace

DURRANCE
(Gazing up at the ceiling where the noise is coming from)

I listen to them laugh and I cant help wondering which ones wont
be coming back The worse part is I think I even know who they are

haRRY
Am I one

DURRANCE
Of course not Harry Youre one of the lucky ones Always have been

HARRY picks up the reference to Ethne but doesnt say anything More
laughter filters through HARRY stares out in the darkness tormented

DURRANCE

What are you thinking
harry

(Hesitating)

Im wondering what a Godforesaken desert in the middle of nowhere has
to do with her Majesty the Queen

DURRANCE

Ask Willoughby Hes on the Colonels staff

harry

I know what hell say Its not for us to question
(A beat)

Do you ever ask yourself why youre going

DURRANCE

Not for the Queen I hardly know her

(He smiles softly)

Nor for the regiment There isnt much of a military tradition in my
family

(A beat)

I suppose Im going because youre going You and Trench and
Castelton and Willoughby

(A big grin)
Not much of a reason I know but it reassures me

HARRY smiles but Durrances words only make him feel more ashamed of
the fear he feels inside
harry

Is there anything that frightens you Jack

DURRANCE

Im frightened of not coming back in one piece Much more than dying
I wouldnt know what to do with myself in a wheel chair And I
couldnt stand to be pitied

He puts the thought out of his head and grins

DURRANCE

Theres a Church near our house Next to the pub Every night at ten
the drunks spill out shouting at the top of their voices Thats
where I want to be buried Where I can hear them

HAMILTON stares at HARRY for what seems an eternity Hes struggling

to make sense of something beyond his comprehension Slowly he gathers
himself and lowers his eyes looking down at Harrys papers

COLONEL HAMILTON

yourself out of my office

I wonder which one it is

ETHNE

Ill open it thank you

She undoes the wrapping Theres a small white box underneath She
opens the lid Theres nothing inside except three white feathers
pinned to three visiting cards ETHNEs about to make a joke when she
suddenly sees how pale HARRY looks

ETHNE

What is it

(Looking at the feathers again)

What does this mean

HARRY

(Slowly)

That there are some things that cant be hidden

ETHNE

(Beginning to look worried)

I dont understand

harry

These are feathers of cowardice

ETHNE laughs nervously

ETHNE

What a horrible joke

harry
It isnt a joke Ethne They were sent in earnest
ETHNE

By whom Who sent them

(Her anger rising)

How dare they

harry

(Reading the cards)

Willoughby Trench and Castelton

ETHNE

You see it is a joke Theyre your friends

She looks to HARRY for confirmation

HARRY

(All he can say)

Youre the most important thing to me

ETHNE

(Panicked by his tone)

Why are you saying that to me now What is it Harry

harry

We were told on Tuesday night that the regiment would be shipping out
to the Sudan instead of India That wed be seeing war within a week
I handed in my resignation the following morning

Theres a long silence as ETHNE takes it in Like Durrance she wont
accept it

ETHNE

I dont believe thats why you resigned You wouldnt have come to me
like this You wouldnt have been able to look me in the eye

HARRY stares at her guiltily tormented
ETHNE
(The tears shining in her eyes)

I dont believe you Three white feathers and our world is at an
end It cant be that simple

And still he doesnt answer

ETHNE

Please Harry You have to answer these charges

harry

(Finally)

I cant All my life Ive been following a path thats filled me with
dread I kept going because of the people behind me and the people
beside me but all I wanted to do was turn and run I didnt even have
the courage to do that until I met you

ETHNE

Dont use me as an excuse

harry

Ethne --

ETHNE

(Pulling away from him)

-- This afternoon you told me you left the army because of me Or at
least you made me believe it Tell me the truth Would you have

resigned if we werent engaged

Theres a long silence These are the hardest words Harrys ever had
to speak

harry
Yes I would have resigned I wouldnt have gone to war for anything

ETHNE stares at him a moment then removes her engagement ring from
her finger and holds it out to him

ETHNE
Ive no right to call you a coward but you are a liar Please take
this back

HARRY takes the ring without protest ETHNE turns and walks away As
she leaves she sets the feathers on the table and closes the door
behind her

HARRY listens to her footsteps fade He walks towards the table As he
looks down he sees four feathers Ethne has snapped the fourth from
her fan

Very carefully as if they were the most precious objects in the
world HARRY gathers them his eyes shining with tears

averts his eyes and climbs into the carriage COLONEL SUTCH looks at

the piles of newspapers that have gathered on his floor over the past

The regimental guns boom outside HARRY opens the window He wants to
hear them more clearly He wants to be reminded of his shame

He walks back to the days newspapers and kneels down amongst the
mess We see headlines of massacres and slaughters beneath them
artists impressions of the Mahdist atrocities

INT HARRYS APARTMENT - DAY

HARRY tries to make the room look more presentable gathering up the
newspapers and maps off the floor He finally stops what hes doing
and turns around

harry

(Quietly)
How is he
COLONEL SUTCH

Hes been very withdrawn Ive tried to persuade him to leave the
house but hes a stubborn man

harry

Will he see me
COLONEL SUTCH

I dont think so
(He pauses)

but if its money you need he wont cut you off He hinted as much
to me

harry

I dont need money Sir

HARRY turns away SUTCH looks torn As a soldier he disapproves of
what Harrys done but as a family friend he cant help feeling sorry
for the boy

COLONEL SUTCH

You were never cut out for this proffession

harry

(A thin smile)

Was it that obvious

COLONEL SUTCH

It was to me Ever since you were a child I only wish Id said
something to your father

HARRY turns and faces him

(With an almost morbid curiosity)
How did you know I didnt have it in me
COLONEL SUTCH
What difference does it make

harry

It does to me Sir Its all I think about What makes a man a coward
COLONEL SUTCH
(Losing patience)

Thats enough Harry Get on a grip on yourself Youre no use to
anyone sitting here all day driving yourself mad

The outburst seems to release SUTCH from his soldiers reserve Hes
all concern now

COLONEL SUTCH

Whats done is done
harry

(Quietly)

No Sir it isnt

HARRY reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small white box He
opens it in front of SUTCH There are four white feathers inside
SUTCH stares at the names on the cards

COLONEL SUTCH

(Stunned)

Who sent you the fourth Jack
harry

Ethne

SUTCH looks up in surprise beginning to realise the full extent of
Harrys heartache
COLONEL SUTCH

Throw them away They dont mean a thing

HARRY

They do to me Sir Theyre all I have left of my friends
COLONEL SUTCH

Harry this is morbid

harry

I dont mean it that way

(Trying to make him understand)

You see if there was something I could do something so
undeniableIm not saying it would change anything its too late

for thatbut if the feathers can be given then they can be taken
back

COLONEL SUTCH

Harry your friends are in Egypt

HARRY

Yes Sir In Alexandria They transfer to Suakin in a fortnight

SUTCH doesnt understand at first Then he looks at the newspapers and
maps spread out across the floor and begins to see the method in
Harrys madness

COLONEL SUTCH
(In disbelief)

-Youre a civilian Even if you find them theres nothing you can
do

harry
Im well aware of my chances
COLONEL SUTCH

Then whats the point
(Staring at him in dismay)

You think Ethne will take you back Is that what you think

From the look in his eyes its clear the thought had entered his head
Sutchs words bring him back down to earth His voice is quieter now
resigned

harry

I dont have any choice

(With a terrible honesty)

Im not sure how much longer I can live with myself here like
this

COLONEL SUTCH stares at him with pity seeing the depth of his
anguish

haRRY

Im leaving for Egypt tomorrow

COLONEL SUTCH

(He realises theres no point trying to dissuade him)
Do you want me to tell your father

harry

Only if something should happen to me Ill write and let you know how
I am as often as I can

COLONEL SUTCH
What about Ethne

HARRY has to think long and hard about this The thought of her fills
him with sadness

HARRY

Id rather you didnt tell her anything After all Ive put her
through the least I can do is let her forget me in peace

COLONEL SUTCH looks moved by his predicament and impressed by these
first grasping signs of nobility
harry

Maybe Ill come back sooner than I think -- hear the guns booming off
the African coast and take the first ship home

I doubt it Harry

around him the MERCHANTS beckoning him into their shops the BRITISH
SOLDIERS on leave sheltering in the cool hollows of the cafes and
whorehouses the BEGGARS hunched up against the stone walls their
faces covered with flies

Through the arches of the Souk a wedding procession appears The

face She gazes at him for a moment then looks away

The colours of the Souk give way to the cool white emptiness of a
colonial hotel ENGLISH GUESTS talk in hushed whispers as EGYPTIAN
WAITERS serve them tea HARRY sits in a corner of the lobby nursing
his drink observing a group of ENGLISH OFFICERS laughing amongst
themselves

HARRY looks thoughtful wondering how to approach them Suddenly he
hears a commotion A drunk BRITISH CORPORAL is escorted out of the
hotel by a group of SENIOR OFFICERS He shouts and swears but they
ignore him throwing him out of the door HARRY gets up as he sees his
chance

drunken BRITISH CORPORAL The mans eyes keep drifting longingly
towards the stage as if he hasnt seen a woman in months HARRY fills
his glass

BRITISH CORPORAL

(Resuming their conversation)

Its all reconnaisance trips The rivers too swollen to move
troops in numbers Her Majestys armys rotting in Suakin

Theyre all there the Hussars the Highlanders the
GrenadiersWhich newspaper did you say you were from

BRITISH CORPORAL

As long as they can if theyre lucky

(He finishes his drink)

Does the Prime Minister read your paper

harry
I imagine so

BRITISH CORPORAL

Then tell him from me were on a losing wicket here These bastards
arent scared of anything If they saw death walking down the street
theyd hide in an alleyway and try to pick him off with a stone How
do you fight people like that

He tries to drain the last few drops from his empty glass then looks
over longingly at the tattooed DANCERS

DURRANCE

Up ahead he sees a large mound of stones standing out amongst the mud
flat He drives his camel forward As he approaches he sees that its
a dervish burial mound Skulls and skeletons are splayed across the
rocks WILLOUGHBY rides up through the ranks and joins him

WILLOUGHBY

What do you think

I think theyre trying to frighten us off We should keep pressing
forward

WILLOUGHBY offers DURRANCE his water flask DURRANCE takes a drink

FRIENDS laugh

man easily but it would mean shooting him in the back He cant bring
himself to do it

DURRANCE
Drop it

The DERVISH SNIPER stops still He turns around slowly and looks
DURRANCE in the eye A contemptuous smile flickers across his face
Very slowly he takes a bullet from his pocket and slips it in the
rifle He doesnt even look at DURRANCE Theres a terrifying
suicidal calm about him

DURRANCE studies his enemy admiring his utter contempt for death and
then fires two bullets into his head

Congratulations it seems you had another successful day
DURRANCE

(Too honest to accept the complement)

We killed one Dervish sniper Sir

COLONEL HAMILTON

Im giving you three weeks leave

DURRANCE looks surprised

DURRANCE

I really dont need or deserve any leave

COLONEL HAMILTON

You certainly deserve it every report I receive singles you out for
praise

DURRANCE
With your permission Id like to stay here with the rest of the
regiment

COLONEL HAMILTON

Permission refused

DURRANCE is too disciplined a soldier to protest
COLONEL HAMILTON

Anyway the rest of the regiment is stuck here in Suakin until the
Government agrees to send us to Khartoum

(Containing his frustration)
You and several other Officers will be going to London to convince
parliament and more importantly public opinion that it is necessary

to pursue this campaign with the utmost vigour Do you have any
questions

DURRANCE

Yes Sir why me

HAMILTON pauses Then almost mischievously
COLONEL HAMILTON

Because youre a hero

DURRANCE

With all due respect Sir I dont think weve been fighting long
enough to have any heroes in this campaign

COLONEL HAMILTON
Thats my point Its all about perception

DURRANCE sees theres no point discussing it further He salutes and
turns to leave

COLONEL HAMILTON
A question Lieutenant

DURRANCE
Yes Sir

COLONEL HAMILTON

What is it you like about this place

DURRANCE chooses his words carefully

DURRANCE

The freedom Sir The fact that one is reduced to what one really is

COLONEL HAMILTON smiles softly wondering if Durrance is insulting
him not giving a damn

EXT desert between EGYPT and sudan - day
A searing white sun hangs over the desert Somewhere amidst the

rolling dunes and floating dust we see a caravan of camels winding
its way through the plateau

EXT caravan desert between egypt and sudan - day

HARRY rides at the front of the caravan with GUSTAVE a sun blackened
french slave-driver Behind them ride SAADI his Dinka assistant and
three beautiful DINKA SLAVEGIRLS

gustave

The British soldiers rent my girls off me for three dhirrams an
hour Well worth the trip to Suakin

HARRY smiles distractedly His eyes are fixed on the majestic
landscape before him miles and miles of rolling desert

gustave
(Recognising the first time awe one feels for the desert)
Dont fall in love too quickly Nothing turns on you like the sand

He looks back at the DINKA SLAVEGIRLS who are whispering amongst
themselves

gustave

(To Saadi)
Keep them quiet What do I pay you for

SAADI says something to the SLAVEGIRLS in their native Dinka tongue
From the deference in his voice its clear the women are from a higher
caste than him

EXT desert between EGYPT and sudan - day

A breeze blows sand-drifts across the desert floor As a veil of dust
clears HARRY sees the bones of a camel forming a perfect skeleton on
the floor

gustAVE

Bones are a good sign We must be near a well

EXT well desert between EGYPT and sudan - day

The skeletons lie thick around the well six or seven men in Bedu
Robes sprawled within yards of the precious water

gustave
(As Harry stares at the bones)

What else is there to fight for in a desert At least it makes sense
of war

SAADI hoists some water up in a goatskin canteen He offers the
canteen to GUSTAVE The French slave-driver is about to take a drink
when he hears one of the DINKA SLAVEGIRLS murmuring in her native
tongue He wheels his camel around angrily

gUSTAVE
(To Saadi)
What did she say

Before SAADI can make an excuse for her the DINKA SLAVEGIRL starts
cursing in her native tongue her eyes fixed on GUSTAVE

GUSTAVE lashes out with his whip The SLAVEGIRLs camel rears
throwing her to the floor GUSTAVE rides towards her raising his
whip ready to beat her

HARRYs camel suddenly lurches between them At first it looks like
hes lost control of the animal but as he steadies his mount it
becomes clear hes put himself in Gustaves way
GUSTAVE sneers With inch perfect skill he starts to circle HARRY
trying to get a clear view of the girl With equal skill HARRY twists
his own camel round keeping her blocked from him at every turn
GUSTAVE grows impatient He raises his whip threatening Harry HARRY
doesnt flinch His eyes are fixed on Gustave the whole time Finally
GUSTAVE backs down intimidated by the mysterious stranger He stares
at HARRY half in anger half in admiration

gustave

You ride well

With that he rides his camel back to the well The DINKA SLAVEGIRL
doesnt look at HARRY Shes too proud to acknowledge his help

INT cave desert between EGYPT and sudan - night

A howling sandstorm blows outside the cave The camels screech in the
night terrified by the wind SAADI and the DINKA GIRLS shelter in the
furthest corner of the cave HARRY and GUSTAVE sit by a flickering
fire

gUSTAVE

Whats your secret Anyone who talks as little as you do must be
hiding something Did you kill a man

HARRY prods the fire ignoring him GUSTAVE turns around as he hears
SAADI and one of the DINKA GIRLS whispering

guSTAVE

Taiser vouz

Silence GUSTAVE turns back to HARRY looking pleased with himself
guSTAVE

You have to break them For their own good Theyll only be happy
again when they forget what its like to be free

(He looks at Harry mischievously)

Its like a man whos been thrown over by a woman At first hes
defiant then hes determined but finally he longs to forget

HARRY gets up and walks to the other side of the cave He hears
GUSTAVE chuckling behind him
gUSTAVE

Any secrets you have the desert will find you out

EXT PASS CLIFFS desert between EGYPT and sudan - night

A screaming gale howls through the desert pass

INT cave desert between EGYPT and sudan - night

It isnt the storm that wakes HARRY up but the sound of whispering
GUSTAVE is snoring by the fire HARRY looks past him He sees SAADI
and the DINKA SLAVEGIRL he rescued earlier lying in each others
arms making love as quietly as they can

HARRY cant help staring Their act seems to represent the ultimate

defiance he ultimate affirmation of their freedom He feels a spark
of hope in their hope

SAADI and the DINKA SLAVEGIRL finally come to rest in each others
arms HARRY listens as they continue to whisper in their native
tongue Hes about to close his eyes when suddenly the DINKA SLAVEGIRL
gets up

HARRY watches curiously as she walks across the cave She picks
something off the floor As she walks towards GUSTAVE HARRY suddenly
sees that its a sharp jagged rock

Before HARRY can say anything the girl falls to her knees and buries
the rock deep into GUSTAVEs face Almost simultaneously HARRY feels a
sharp crack on the back of his head He rolls away instinctively but
to no avail

The blows rain down As he tries to protect his face HARRY sees
SAADI holding a thick wooden club over him The club hammers down
splitting Harrys fingers tearing into his face knocking any
resistance out of him

As he stares up listlessly HARRY sees SAADI standing over him ready
to finish him off Suddenly a voice rings out a womans voice
calling Saadi off HARRYs eyes drift away

INT ARMYNAVY CLUB - LONDON - day

We see ETHNEs face now staring out For a moment we think shes part
of Harrys dream but then the familiar noises of reality fade in and
we realise shes amongst a crowd of OFFICERS and JOURNALISTS
listening to DURRANCE lecturing about the Sudan

DURRANCE
(Aware shes in the audience)

Each moment we delay we imperil General Gordons life The Mahdi
is concentrating all his forces on Khartoum At most the garrison can
hold out for a few more weeks

DURRANCE tries not to stare at ETHNE too hard

DURRANCE

Im afraid I have to give another talk
ETHNE

(Suddenly)

Would you mind if I didnt come with you Caroline I dont know the
Gilbys all that well

CAROLINE hesitates We see the reluctance in her eyes but shes far
too dignified to show it

CAROLINE

EXT LONDON STREET - day

DURRANCE and ETHNE walk along a crowded street Passing WOMEN glance
admiringly at DURRANCE in his uniform

Six married women gawping at you

DURRANCE smiles shyly wondering if shes flirting with him
INT tea shop LONDON - day

A tinkle of china and cutlery ETHNE and DURRANCE sit in a tea shop
ETHNE cant help sending up the place She dabs her lips with her
napkin pretending to be all prim and proper

DURRANCE

Do you want to go somewhere else

ETHNE

No its lovely here Im teasing

DURRANCE looks out of place in the surroundings and nervous around
ETHNE

ETHNE
(Trying to put him at ease)
I want to hear all about the desert

She leans towards him like a child waiting to hear a tale DURRANCE
isnt sure if shes aware of the effect on him

DURRANCE

It grows on you Theres something about all that emptiness that
concentrates the mind

ETHNE

(Looking into his eyes)
On what

DURRANCE

(He hesitates)

You spend a lot of time thinking about the people you miss --
especially at night -- You have the most vivid dreams its hard to

believe theyre not real

He stops as he sees the sadness in her eyes reminded of the barrier
between them

DURRANCE

Have you heard from Harry

ETHNE

(A beat)

No Have you

DURRANCE

I went to see General Feversham He refused to discuss it with me
ETHNE

I know they had a falling out

She tries to sound casual but DURRANCE feels how much the thought of
Harry still pains her

DURRANCE

(Testing her almost in spite of himself)

Hes one of the people I think about all the time
ETHNE

(Very deliberately)

I dont as much as I used to

(Looking up at Durrance)

I certainly wasnt until you brought him up
Theres a touch of reproach in her eyes but also something
flirtatious Its as if shes forcing herself to put Durrance above
Harry in her thoughts

ETHNE

When do you go back

DURRANCE

Friday

ETHNE

So soon

DURRANCE isnt sure how to read her disappointment He feels
conflicted about Harry but he cant help being drawn to her

DURRANCE
(Awkwardly)

Are you sure I cant persuade you to stay in London a few more days
Listen to more of my boring lectures

ETHNE

I thought the talk was fascinating

DURRANCE

(Steeling himself)

I really would like to see you again before I leave

Theres something touching about Durrances shyness a contradiction
between the fearless warrior and the tentative lover ETHNE feels
torn but she wills herself on

ETHNE

(Lightly but acknowledging his invitation nevertheless)

You could always visit us in Bintree

She feels her eyes drifting away from him but she forces herself to
look back and holds his gaze
INT cave desert between EGYPT and sudan - day

HARRY opens his eyes painfully His face is still battered and swollen
from Saadis beating As he picks himself up he sees Gustaves body
lying exactly where the Dinka slavegirl killed him the jagged rock
still embedded in his face HARRY looks away as he hears a camel
whinnying outside

EXT cave desert between EGYPT and sudan - day

The camel is tied by some rope to a jutting rock a goatskin canteen
slung over its back HARRY realises the Dinka girl he rescued has left
them for him He looks over the horizon Theres no sign of the
Dinkas only the vast desert waste

EXT DUNES desert between EGYPT and sudan - day

HARRY urges his camel up the steep slope of a crescent dune His
battered face is burnt raw by the sun his skin covered in blisters
He looks out hopefully as his camel finally conquers the sandy peak
but all he sees in its place are miles and miles of rolling dunes

EXT water trough desert between EGYPT and sudan - day

Harrys camel noses its way into a shallow water trough HARRY almost
drops off the animal in his haste to drink He digs his hands into the
mud and cups some of the precious liquid in his palms Its only after
hes drunk that he realises there are dozens of tics stuck to his
arms and face

EXT desert between EGYPT and sudan - night

HARRY shivers in the cold night air partly from the wind but also
from the fever hes caught off the tics Hands trembling he burns the
blood gorged insects off his arm with a glowing stick from the camp-
fire

EXT shingles desert between EGYPT and sudan - day

HARRYs camel rears as it treads over the searing shingles He topples
off Eyes half shut he grabs the reins making sure the camel doesnt
run off He takes a knife from his pocket

He cuts a slash in the camels hide and puts his mouth to it He sucks
up what little blood he can and rolls the liquid around his mouth
EXT desert between EGYPT and sudan - night

HARRY talks to himself in the dark His face is all puffed up with
fever his hair chalked with dust Above him the stars glimmer
promising another day of relentless sun

EXT DESERT HILLS desert between EGYPT and sudan - day

HARRY lies unconscious on the camels back roped to the animal The
CAMEL noses its way through the desert floor coming across a few
shrubs It tears them out of the earth and starts up the hill in
search of more nourishment HARRY slides precariously down the camels
back Only the ropes hold him tight As the camel finally reaches the
top we see a vast plateau open up before us The earth is still desert
brown but there are patches of green now -- and somewhere in the
distance the sky is blackening with rain

a cry of disappointment from the riverbank A group of LOCAL CHILDREN

smiles at his friends antics
treNCH

-Dont give up lads Give the old porker another whack

The BOYS have tied a pig to a stake outside the water They beat it
with a paddle until it whines Hearing the noise the CROCODILE rears
its head and sweeps towards the remaining lump of meat on the hook
TRENCH and the BOYS swarm around the river expectantly In their
excitement they fail to notice the shrouded FIGURE watching them from
the distance Its HARRY hidden beneath his Bedu robes He gazes at
his two friends longingly Finally one of the BOYS sees him and
thinking hes a leper starts throwing stones

sudanese boy

Imshi imshi

The other BOYS join in yelling insults TRENCH and CASTELTON pay no
attention They have no idea who it is

at his friends He knows he doesnt have the courage to face them yet
that its too soon

reaction

INT HARRYs ROOM LOCAL HOTEL SUAKIN SUDAN - night

tough leathery skin his eyes are hollow from recent hardships He
whispers to himself in broken Arabic and dips his fingers into a
dark mud like substance He applies it to his hair his beard and
his teeth

EXT COOLIES BRITISH CAMP SUAKIN - day
Long lines of DESERT AFRICANS have gathered outside the British camp

looking for work as coolies There are Nuers Dinkas Somalis
Ethiopians all of them wearing different clothes and speaking

different languages Somewhere amongst them we see HARRY disguised
in his Bedu robes Hes being examined by a BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR and
an EGYPTIAN ORDERLY

BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR

Tell him to remove his shirt

HARRY waits for the ORDERLY to translate before he opens his robes
His body is lean and tanned and scarred

BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR
(Impressed by his physique)
This ones been in the wars Let me see his teeth

Again HARRY waits for the Arabic translation before he opens his
mouth

BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR

Good bones Put him on the boats

HARRY is ushered off As he walks away he hears an argument start up
behind him The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY is protesting to the SEARGENT MAJOR
about hiring a fierce looking NUBIAN warrior

EGYPTIAN ORDERLY

This man comes from a race of slaves They have blood feuds with
everyone If you arm him it will mean trouble None of the Egyptian
soldiers will serve with him

The NUBIAN stares ahead in silence expressionless

BRITISH OFFICER

Alright put him on the boats

The NUBIAN falls into line behind HARRY

holding out his soup bowl waiting to be fed The NUBIAN squats
opposite him HARRY cant help staring at the long white ostrich
feather in his hair

The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY arrives and pours a rancid looking gruel in
HARRYs bowl He turns to the NUBIAN

EGYPTIAN ORDERLY
(In Arabic)
Is this good enough for you slave

The NUBIAN ignores him The ORDERLY spits in the gruel before handing
it to him The NUBIAN takes it and calmly downs it in one The
ORDERLY moves on in disgust The NUBIAN looks at HARRY HARRY braces
himself and swallows the stew

EXT CATARACTS of the nile sudan - day

A heavy current rushes through the waters of the Nile The cataracts
are full of treachorous rocks jutting out in all shapes and sizes
HARRY is force-marched with the other COOLIES prodded on by the
EGYPTIAN OVERSEERS They drag the British supply boats through the
cataract by hand pulling on huge hemp ropes

In front of HARRY the NUBIAN is being singled out for punishment The
EGYPTIAN ORDERLY lashes him repeatedly The NUBIAN keeps pulling
ignoring the stinging pain He looks back at the ORDERLY as if to say
Is that all youve got

EXT SUPPLY BOAT CATARACTS of the nile sudan - day

at the top of his voice as the spray hits his face CASTELTON stands

COOLIES dragging their boat through the cataracts

EXT COOLIE CAMP CATARACTS of the nile sudan - night

Drum beats fill the night sky The reflection of the coolies camp-
fires glistens over the black water Some are singing others praying
but most lie fast asleep HARRY sits on his own warming himself by a
fire his body wracked with pain As he reflects he hears the gentle
tread of feet He looks up to see the NUBIAN staring at him The man
squats down beside his campfire without asking

ABU FATMA suddenly launches into a flurry of fluent Arabic HARRY
stares at him in silence unable to respond

ABOU FATMA

There are many in this camp who would serve the Mahdi When they find
out there is a British spy amongst them watching them they will kill
him

(Quietly mocking)

(Pointing to a feather earring in his left ear)
Five men

(and an ivory bracelet on his wrist)

This I will wear soon Im a good soldier I will protect you

HARRY stares at him a moment then takes out a small box from his
pocket He shows ABOU FATMA the four white feathers inside ABOU FATMA

looks at them unaware of the irony in Harrys gesture thinking hes
saying he doesnt need help

ABOU FATMA
(Gesturing to the welts on Harrys body)

Underneath the flesh is white and weak Even if the Mahdis men dont
find you out the whips will
harry

Ill pay you one shilling a day

stares after him

blood his belly sliced open holding his guts in his hands

HARRY stands amongst the gathered crowd watching horrified as a
BRITISH OFFICER kneels beside the dying man

BRITISH OFFICER

Who did this to you Who did this

The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY tries to speak but all that comes out of his
mouth is a froth of blood His tongue has been cut out HARRY looks
around the crowd until he sees ABOU FATMA The Nubians eyes are
expressionless Around his neck he wears the beaded necklace now
EXT CATARACTS of the nile sudan - day

The white sails of the British supply boats float through the hazy
water On the riverbank HARRY and the hundreds of other COOLIES drag

EXT DESERT lanscape sudan - day

A region of jutting cliffs and giant rock formations The Desert
column rides through a narrow pass DURRANCEs eyes are fixed on the
ridges above them any one of which could be hiding a Dervish sniper
or scout

At the back of the column HARRYs equally alert He looks across the
cliff walls Suddenly he notices one of the COOLIES in front of him
listening intently to a high pitched whine coming from a nearby gorge
HARRY studies the man Hes a powerfully built NUER TRIBESMAN yellow
streaks running down his long black hair Every time he hears the
distinctive noise he looks up concentrating HARRY edges closer to
ABOU FATMA

harry

(Indicating the whining)

Do you recognise that sound

ABOU FATMA

HARRY doesnt look convinced He stares at the NUER TRIBESMAN walking
ahead of them glancing up from his heavy load every time he hears the
distinctive cry

EXT OPEN DESERT sudan - day

through the shimmering heatwaves

COLONEL HAMILTON looks at the clear blue sky seeing nothing to
indicate a storm but trusting Durrances instincts

EXT DESERT CAMP - night

HARRY and the other COOLIES gather sticks and desert shrubs building
a makeshift wall around the camp The wind has picked up blowing
thick gusts of sand in their faces As they work in the darkness and
the dust HARRY hears the whining sound he heard earlier Its quieter
now but closer ABOU FATMA hears it too

harry
Its coming from inside the camp

They look around but the dust obscures everything The whining starts
up again HARRY concentrates until he thinks he knows where its
coming from He checks to make sure the ORDERLIES arent watching
them and then signals for ABOU FATMA to follow him

EXT EDGE OF THE DESERT CAMP - night

Through the drifting clouds of sand we see a FIGURE crouching near the
camp perimeter Its the NUER TRIBESMAN Harry noticed earlier Every
time the wind picks up he calls out to the surrounding cliffs ina
high piched whine

HARRY and ABOU FATMA watch him from behind a wagon ABOU FATMA draws a
knife from his boot

haRRY

We need to find out who hes signalling
ABOU FATMA replaces the knife reluctantly and points to a makeshift
corrall where the camels are gathered

shelter inside sharing a bottle of whisky DURRANCE sits apart from

DURRANCE

Grins all around DURRANCE looks at letter and tempts them with a
single line

DURRANCE

I often think about our walks by the river
He stops enigmatically to a chorus of protest
tRENCH

More more

DURRANCE hesitates reluctant to break the confidence of a letter but
anxious to broach the subject with his friends

DURRANCE
(Reading more quietly)

Your letter surprised and delighted meIf I appear indecisive
its because Im thinking of both of usIn the meantime I hope the
length of my reply gives you some assurance of how very much I care
about you

DURRANCE lowers the letter and looks at his friends

treNCH

So whos the lucky lady

(After a moment)

EthneIve asked her to marry meYou probably gathered that from

Theres a long silence Astonishment Then suddenly TRENCH raises his
glass and roars

idea of how much I bloody love you

DURRANCE

TRENCH fills his glass to the brim DURRANCE laughs relieved that his
friends have taken it so well Its only as he drinks that he catches

a hint of disapproval in CASTELTONs eyes CASTELTON raises his glass
trying to hide his feelings but DURRANCE sees through him The moment
is interrupted by loud shouting outside

BRITISH CORPORAL os

-Somethings up with the camels

CASTELTON

Ill go

CASTELTON looks relieved to leave the tent worried that his
conflicting emotions will betray him DURRANCE stares after him not
entirely free of the memory of Harry himself

EXT DESERT CAMP - night

CASTELTON follows the CORPORAL through the windswept camp Up ahead
they can hear the camels screeching CASTELTON covers his eyes from
the dust Suddenly he sees the silhouettes of two RIDERS charging out
of the corral One of them stops and stares at him momentarily

CASTELTON

(He cant see the mans face clearly but his outline seems hauntingly
familiar)

Harry

The RIDER turns and charges out of the camp The CORPORAL blows a
whistle reaching for his gun firing after them CASTELTON stares at
the disappearing figures wondering if what he saw was real or a
figment of his troubled conscience

FATMAs are fixed on him

ABOU FATMA

Why would a British spy be hiding from his own people

HARRY looks up at the Nubian realising he cant keep up the pretence
any longer

HARRY

Because Im not a spy

ABOU FATMA

Youre a deserter

(A long pause)

Something like that I was sent to fight and I ran away

long black hair streaked yellow their faces painted ghostly white

They survey the land beneath them and gallop off

EXT THE same HILL desert - day

ABOU FATMA and HARRY walk their camels quietly up the hill following
the Nuers hoofprints As they reach the top of the dune a vast
plateau opens up beneath them They see the NUER SCOUTS riding along
a winding trade route At the end of the desert road stands a huge
fortress

ABOU FATMA
That is Abou Clea A British fort

HARRY stares after the Nuer scouts wondering why theyre heading back
into a British stronghold The four riders merge into one of the
caravans that dot the landscape

BRITISH SENTRIES can be glimpsed high up The fortress gates creak
open to let the caravan through HARRY lowers his eyes as he rides
past the guards

EXT courtyard FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

As he looks up again HARRY suddenly feels a rush of panic The
fortress courtyard is filled with DERVISH WARRIORS There are no
British faces anywhere HARRY glimpses a familiar red uniform but as
he stares more closely his relief turns to horror The British
uniform is stained with blood Wearing it is a fierce looking DERVISH
WARRIOR with long braided hair

HARRY looks back at the ramparts All the soldiers he thought were
British sentries are in fact Dervish warriors wearing the bloody
uniforms of their victims As he turns around HARRY sees the worst
sight of all Hanging from scaffolds are the chalk white bodies of
the real British soldiers

HARRY is shaken out of his horror by a sharp hissing sound ABOU FATMA
glares at him to keep calm DERVISH WARRIORS grab hold of their
camels and lead them with the rest of the caravan towards the
stables

INT stables FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

the stables unchallenged

EXT courtyard FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

HARRY follows ABOU FATMA through the crowded courtyard His eyes are
drawn to the torchlit faces all around him The Mahdis army is made
up of dozens of different tribes some in glowing war paint others
marked with ritual scars wearing the dried viscera of their victims
around their necks The Dervishes eyes seem to follow HARRY wherever
he goes staring out at him through their slit Djellabas Suddenly
HARRY feels a pair of hands grab him He wheels around to see a huge
DERVISH CAPTAIN towering over him

DERVISH CAPTAIN

(In Arabic studying Harrys features)
Come with me

(In Arabic)

Our caravan is waiting outside

slipping in the English words Ill find you

DERVISH CAPTAIN

(To Harry in Arabic)

Follow me

EXT gallows courtyard FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

HARRYs heart is pounding as he walks back through the hellish
courtyard He isnt sure if the DERVISH CAPTAIN has realised hes
British Its only as he points HARRY towards the gallows that he
realises the predicament hes in

DERVISH CAPTAIN

(In Arabic gesturing to a mound of British dead)

Over there

HARRY hesitates then walks over to the pile of British corpses
convinced hes going to be shot amongst them

DERVISH CAPTAIN
(In Arabic gesturing to the uniforms)
Find one that fits

HARRY stares at him then slowly begins to understand Hes been
picked out as a pale looking Arab one that might pass as a British
officer from a distance As he looks around he sees other DESERT
ARABS grinning at him wearing their own blood stained British
uniforms

HARRY kneels beside the slaughtered British soldiers One of them
still has his pipe stuffed between his teeth As HARRY stares at the
obscenity his fear slowly turns to anger With trembling fingers he
unbuttons the dead mans jacket As he slips the bloodstained British
uniform over his shoulders we begin to see the change in his eyes
EXT ABOU FATMA courtyard FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

ABOU FATMA wanders amongst the Dervish army begging for alms
searching for Harry Finally he spots him at the far end of the
courtyard sitting amongst the other DERVISH WARRIORS IN BRITISH
UNIFORMS

EXT HARRY courtyard FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

ABOU FATMA grovels at the feet of the DERVISHES before he approaches
HARRY

ABOU FATMA

(In Arabic)

Alms for the poor

HARRY turns around His eyes are distant He looks back at the spot he
was staring at before At first ABOU FATMA thinks hes in shock but
then he sees what HARRYs looking at Across the courtyard stands a
large tent surrounded by flags Waiting outside are the four NUER
SCOUTS

ABOU FATMA

(Beginning to see his intent)

We have to leave

harry

Wait for me at the gates

(As Abou Fatma starts to protest)

The other DERVISHES look at ABOU FATMA threateningly ABOU FATMA gets
up and walks away reluctantly Across the courtyard the NUER SPIES
have been ushered into the tent

SCOUTS in silence As they notify him of the British advance he
starts to draw a battle plan on the tents sandy floor His
LIEUTENANTS move closer to see what hes planning

INT WAR COUNCIL tent FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

Outside the tent more DERVISH WARRIORS have gathered to catch a
glimpse of their revered leader HARRY is amongst them He stares at
the white clad figures within Suddenly he feels a pair of eyes on
him He turns to see the DERVISH CAPTAIN who stopped him earlier
watching him intently HARRY moves off The DERVISH CAPTAIN stares
after him suspiciously

EXT gates FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

ABOU FATMA waits anxiously outside the fortress gates The hordes of
STARVING BEGGARS are pushed back as a troop of DERVISH WARRIORS ride
out carrying the naked bodies of the British dead ABOU FATMA stares
after them wondering whats going on

EXT HARRY courtyard FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

HARRY looks behind him Through the milling crowd he sees the DERVISH
CAPTAIN still following him His heart pounding HARRY heads towards
the stables trying to give him the slip

EXT HARRY STABLES FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

Camels kick and snort in the stable HARRY crouches down Through the
animals legs he sees the DERVISH CAPTAIN enter

Suddenly the DERVISH CAPTAIN shouts at the top of his voice The
camels scatter leaving HARRY exposed The DERVISH CAPTAIN stares at
him menacingly

HARRY bows and starts to walk towards him in supplication His hand
slips behind his back groping for the knife thats hidden there

The DERVISH CAPTAIN barks at him to stay where he is As he steps
backwards HARRY suddenly charges and drives the dagger deep into his
gut The DERVISH CAPTAIN screams but all that comes out is a terrible
hissing sound

HARRY clamps his hand over the CAPTAINs mouth and bends his head
backwards As they tumble to the ground HARRY twists the knife in
deeper The Dervish bites down in agony drawing a stream of blood
from Harrys knuckles HARRY rams his fist deeper into the mans
throat choking him slowly Meanwhile his knife hand tears its way out
of the Dervishs gut and plunges back into his thigh

The CAPTAINs eyes water in pain and fear HARRY stares at him
crushing his spirit with his own unflinching gaze As he feels the
mans grip weaken he pulls away sharply and swings the knife down
with all his force The blade sticks in the DERVISH CAPTAINs chest

sending his eyes spinning out of focus forcing a rush of blood out of
his mouth

HARRY watches in horror as the mans eyes roll around desperately
trying to find their focus then stop still He feels his enemys
dying breath on his face and hears a horrible sucking sound as he
withdraws the knife

HARRYs arm is elbow deep in gore He turns away and tries to retch
but nothing comes out He stays like that for a moment bent over the
bloody sand contemplating what hes just done Finally he gathers
himself grabs the dead man by the ankles and drags him further into
the stable

EXT courtyard FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night

HARRY brushes past the crowds of DERVISH WARRIORS his eyes fixed on
the fortress gates ahead Hes only a few yards away when a DERVISH
SENTRY calls out

DERVISH SENTRY

(In Arabic)

The gates are closed

HARRY stares at him dangerously For an instant it looks like another
fight may ensue but then a calming voice calls out

ABOU FATMA

(In Arabic)

Let him give us alms It will bring you both fortune in battle

ABOU FATMA sticks his hands through the fortress gates along with the
hundreds of other BEGGARS outside HARRY begins to understand He
pulls out some coins from his robes and approaches the BEGGARS

harry

(Whispering to Abou Fatma as he hands out alms)

They say you can tell a womans heart by the way she plays

ETHNE
What if she cant play at all

DURRANCE

on in

It isnt how well you play its how passionately you stroke the keys

ETHNE presses the keys harder pretending its a joke

might see through her
DURRANCE

Id say youre in love

worried that he
Even though its said in jest his words stick like a knife The notes
torture her She suddenly gets up and walk away from the piano

DURRANCE

(Following her footsteps)

Where are you going

ETHNE

I want to hear you play on your own

A moments silence Then DURRANCE turns back to the piano and starts
to play -- quietly tenderly The haunting music breaks Ethnes heart
Almost involuntarily she starts to walk away from him towards the
open patio doors

DURRANCE

(With a sudden flourish of the keys)

There you go Im in love too

He swivels around and beams at her joyfully ETHNE stares back at him
unable to speak

DURRANCE
(Gazing at her adoringly)

These past few days have been the best days of my life blind or
otherwise

His eyes shine in the candlelight full of new-found hope

DURRANCE

Before I came here Id given up I put on all kinds of fronts and
defences but deep down I was petrified I had no idea what was going
on around me what people were thinking behind my back I imagined the
worst so that nothing would surprise me no-one would catch me out
He walks closer

DURRANCE

Youve made me realise I cant live like that Whether one can see
or not theres no way of knowing how people really feel about you
all you can do is put yourself in their hands and trust them
unconditionally

ETHNE cant speak

DURRANCE

I know how much you loved Harry
(A beat)

for the first time Im not afraid to admit it Im not not afraid
to bring it up between us

(A beat)

Im not afraid because of you Ethne because of the way youve made
me feel

He waits for an answer but all that greets him is silence As he steps
closer he suddenly loses her presence A touch of panic enters his
voice

DURRANCE
Ethne

The only sound he hears is the wind on the curtains We see for the
first time that Ethnes left through the open patio doors

DURRANCE
Ethne

He turns around sharply as he hears a noise CAROLINE stands in the
doorway DURRANCE walks towards her

DURRANCE

(Touching her arm)

I thought youd disappeared
CAROLINE

Its Caroline Ethnes gone

DURRANCE pulls back embarrassed
DURRANCE

Im sorry

CAROLINE

She must be in the garden

DURRANCE

(Trying to sound lighthearted)

She was here a minute ago It must have been something I said
CAROLINE

(Every word is calculated)

I dont think it was anything you said Shes been upset all
afternoon Ever since she spoke to Lieutenant Willoughby

DURRANCE

Willoughby

He looks perplexed

DURRANCE

Willoughby was here Why didnt he come and see me

CAROLINE

I thought he did I saw you walking into the maze to join them

She feels the impact on him -- the fact that he called out and no-one
answered

DURRANCE

(Trying to justify it to himself)
He must have had his reasons
CAROLINE

He brought her two white feathers Thats all I know

DURRANCE looks up startled
DURRANCE
Harry

CAROLINE watches his unseeing eyes trying to make sense of whats
happened She feels a touch of remorse as she sees him struggling with
his emotions Finally he looks up

DURRANCE

Ethne obviously didnt want me to know
(Curiously)

Why did you tell me
CAROLINE hesitates
CAROLINE

I thought you should know
DURRANCE

Youre her friend
CAROLINE

Yours too I hope

DURRANCE stares at her in silence her intentions slowly becoming
clear to him

DURRANCE

Youre not fair to Ethne

CAROLINE

Are you

Her meaning is clear Her words sting him deeply
DURRANCE

How much of our conversation did you overhear

CAROLINE
Enough
DURRANCE
Then you should know I meant every word

(more with pity than anger)

love and trust Ethne unconditionally Whatever doubts shes feeling
know shell resolve them

(With quiet dignity)

ve put myself in her hands

A long silence DURRANCE doesnt need to see CAROLINE to know shes in
tears

CAROLINE

The only reason I told you was because you mean the world to me
DURRANCE

(A gentle rebuff)

Im sorry Mrs Adair

EXT THE CITY OF DONGOLA SOUTHERN SUDAN - night

The peeling CORPSE of a British soldier is dragged through the streets
by a rope tied to a camels back LOCAL WOMEN tear at the dead mans
uniform grabbing at his testicles spitting on his bloated face
HARRY slips out of the crowd horrified by what hes seen relieved it
isnt Trench

EXT DONGOLA SUDAN - day

The jeering women can be heard in the distance ABOU FATMA sits in the
shade slurping an oily gruel HARRY squats beside him ABOU FATMA
offers him the bowl HARRY declines

ABOU FATMA

Youre surprised by the women
HARRY doesnt need to answer his face says it all
ABOU FATMA

Theyre always the most cruel Amongst the Southern Tribes its the
custom for them to go into battle first calling the men cowards until
theyre ready to fight

(Mischievously)

It is the same in your country no

HARRY looks up to find ABOU FATMA grinning at him

ABOU FATMA

The woman you spoke of Go back to her Tell her youre ready
haRRY

What did you find out about the British prisoners

ABOU FATMA

There are very few of them left

He offers HARRY his food again This time HARRY takes the bowl and
swallows the rancid meat as if its nothing

harry

Where are they being held
ABOU FATMA
Your Army abandoned them The shame is no longer yours

harry

(Provoking him)
Have I paid you for nothing Abou Fatma

The Nubian looks up stung by the talk of money when he was only
expressing concern

ABOU FATMA

(Coldly)
Twelve British soldiers were taken by boat from here to Omdurman last
month

haRRY

Shoukhran

ABOU FATMA

Youre a foolish man Even for a British Officer
HARRY

(Smiling)

God protects the fool’

(Passing Abou Fatma the bowl)

How would I get into the prison at Omdurman
ABOU FATMA

(Sarcastically)

Urinate in a holy well

harry

That carries a penalty of death All I want is to be imprisoned there
ABOU FATMA stops eating realising HARRY is serious
ABOU FATMA

You will die before your time

haRRY

If it is the will of God

ABOU FATMA

(Impatient now)

This man turned his back on you Why should you give your life for
his

harry
Because hed do the same for me No matter what had passed between us
(Looking at the Nubian)

I hope Id do the same for you too

ABOU FATMA

I have no need of such friends

The Nubian returns to his food betraying no sentiment HARRY reaches
into his pocket and holds out five shilling coins

ABOU FATMA

(Disdainfully)

You owe me two shillings a day This is too much

HARRY cant help smiling

haRRY

You still havent answered my question

ABOU FATMA

You answered it yourself God protects the fool

EXT night MARKET outside the city of OMDURMAN - night

HARRY stumbles around the marketplace strumming on a broken zither
pestering people for money pretending to be mad The passing crowds
laugh at him and push him away ABOU FATMA watches from across the
street

HARRY staggers through the torchlit stalls He sees a group of DERVISH
WARRIORS gathered around a fire Their leader a sickly looking EMIR
smokes a hashish pipe as he listens to his men recounting their feats
of war Next to him lies a beautiful jewel encrusted scabbard

HARRY thinks a moment then approaches the group strumming his
zither grinning at the men Seeing the crazed musician the DERVISH
WARRIORS cover their ears Some of them toss chunks of meat at him

HARRY picks up the dusty morsels chewing them with relish grinning
like a happy puppy

ABOU FATMA watches as HARRY humiliates himself playing his broken
zither for the EMIR The EMIR gazes back at him through bored
bloodshot eyes

As the WARRIORS laugh HARRY suddenly bends down and snatches the
Emirs scabbard He runs off with it at speed waving it around his
head like a sword yelling at the top of his voice The DERVISH
WARRIORS give chase still laughing as they run after the lunatic

HARRY stumbles over a tent pole deliberately The DERVISH WARRIORS
swarm around him caning him with their sticks HARRY protects his
face with his hands pleading

EXT WELL outside the city of OMDURMAN - night

The whole marketplace has gathered to watch the madman punished The
WARRIORS hoist HARRY up onto a well and shout at him to walk around
the rim Holding out his hands HARRY starts to step around the ledge
As he glances down he sees the drop is at least thirty feet deep Two
of the WARRIORS jump onto the ledge behind him blowing bugles in his
ear

DERVISH WARRIORS
(In Arabic)
Faster thiefFaster

HARRY starts to walk faster clapping in time with the WARRIORS
performing for the CROWD

harry

(In Arabic)

God loves the fool God loves the fool

Another WARRIOR steps out of the crowd and starts prodding HARRY with
his spear The CROWD roars as HARRY almost topples into the well He
regains his footing and laughs back at them clapping his hands

wriggling his hips

spectators voiCE
(In Arabic)
Heres someone for him to dance with

HARRY looks down to see a hideous half-naked HAG being pushed
towards him The crowd clears a space for the two lunatics to dance
HARRY forces a crazed giggle as the HAG starts to undulate and thrust
her hips at him He echoes her movements staring into her deadened
eyes

The CROWD pushes them closer together HARRY feels an overwhelming
sense of pity and dread The dreamlike intensity is getting to him
The tragic creature shimmying before his eyes is like a grotesque
reminder of the woman he loved and lost

The HAG starts murmuring to herself As he listens HARRY realises
shes singing -- a tuneless lament remembered from long ago sung
without any understanding now The emotion wells up in HARRYs eyes
even as he laughs at her Its as if hes gazing into a crazy
distorted mirror

The EMIR stares curiously as he catches the emotion in Harrys eyes
He suddenly signals for his men to part the lunatics HARRY is dragged
away from the shrieking HAG and flung before him

EMIR
(In Arabic suspicious now)

Play for me fool

HARRY picks up his zither and starts to play a tuneless din
EMIR

(In Arabic)

Youre not mad

HARRY pretends not to understand The EMIR suddenly cracks his cane
down on Harrys hands breaking his fingers HARRY screams in agony

harry
(In Arabic)
God loves the fool

EMIR
(In Arabic)
The fool feels no pain

The EMIR beats him again with the cane HARRY holds up his broken
fingers in supplication singing softly in his madmans gibberish

harry

(In Arabic)

God loves the fool

The EMIRs cane cracks open his face He doubles over in agony
spitting out blood ABOU FATMA watches sickened unable to do

anything Even the other spectators look shaken HARRY slithers away
in the dust whimpering like an animal

EMIR

(In Arabic)

Youre not mad Tell me who are you Tell me or Ill kill you

ABOU FATMA stares in silence willing HARRY to speak Many in the
CROWD turn away fearing the worst The EMIR raises his cane With a
surge of effort HARRY lifts up his blood soaked face and grins at
the EMIR He looks barely human his face ripped open swollen beyond
recognition

harry

(Singing softly in Arabic)

God loves the fool God loves the fool

The EMIR hesitates convinced nobody in their right mind could take
this much pain

(In Arabic)
Hes mad Take him to the prison Let him sing for them there

He turns away and disappears into the crowd ABOU FATMA stares at
HARRY with both pity and admiration He whispers a prayer for his
friends safety
EXT PRISON of OMDURMAN BANKS OF THE NILE - night

The evening prayers drift over the waters of the Nile In the distance
we see the prison of Omdurman a huge dome of stone surrounded by
fifty foot walls on three sides and the river itself on the fourth

INT HOUSE OF STONE PRISON OMDURMAN - night

Hundreds of shapes move forward in the darkness At first they look
like a herd of animals but slowly we recognise the grunts and cries
as human Faces come at us out of the dark screaming and cursing
shoving each other violently raising their faces to the ceiling
gasping for air

As our eyes adjust to the light the vision of hell intensifies The
PRISONERS are manacled and herded into a space no more than thirty
feet wide They circle the room in a clockwise direction pushed on by
each other in perpetual motion afraid that if they stop theyll be
sucked under the maelstrom and trampled underfoot

The most fortunate are those whove found a resting space in the
corners of the room They cling to the walls fighting off anyone who
tries to share their sanctuary From somewhere amongst them we hear a
familiar voice

trench

Get away This is Ibrahims space

TRENCH protects his corner lashing out at anyone who tries to breach
the space He bellows at the top of his voice

trENCH
Ibrahim where are you

A voice answers from the heaving mass TRENCH holds out his hand and
drags his friend IBRAHIM out of the scrum

trench

(Sounding half crazed)

You mustnt fall You musnt fall

As if to prove his point a fight breaks out at the far side of the
room TRENCH stands on tiptoes as eager as everyone else to see the
outcome TWO PRISONERS try to strangle each other with their chains

fighting for an inch of space Its hard to make out anything in the
dark but the savagery of the fight is reflected in the speed of
flailing fists and feet One of the PRISONERS finally loses his
footing In an instant hes sucked under The victor laughs
maniacally The losers cries continue for a moment and then stop
suddenly as the trampling feet break his neck

TRENCH turns to Ibrahim with the knowing look of an expert

trench

We mustnt fall Ibrahim We musnt fall

Suddenly theres a cry from outside the cell door

prison guards os

(In Arabic)

Back Get back

The PRISONERS closest to the door push away The head guard the
towering IDRIS-ES-SAIER tosses in a blazing torch to clear some
space A NEW PRISONER is flung inside and the door slammed shut behind
him The other PRISONERS surge back trying to reclaim their space
There are cries of pain as some of them tread on the blazing torch

The sheer weight of men quickly puts it out

The NEW PRISONER holds onto anything he can to stop himself falling
From his corner TRENCH looks on grimly

treNCH
Watch Ibrahim Hes going to fall

The NEW PRISONER is swept up in the savage wave As he approaches
TRENCHs corner he tries to claw his way to safety TRENCH beats him
back with a flurry of blows The prisoner disappears under the heaving
bodies but then he pops up again gasping for breath He fights with
all his might swinging his fists clutching at anyone in his way
TRENCH looks impressed but he knows it wont be long

trench
Hell fall Youssef will get him
As the NEW PRISONER swings towards them again the prisoner behind

him YOUSSEF slams his chains down on his head The new arrival goes
down hard As he disappears he screams out the name Trench
TRENCH stares in disbelief frozen for a moment then bellowing like a
bull he charges out of his corner and flails his way through the
heaving mass trying to retrieve the fallen prisoner

TRENCH
Help me Ibrahim
The tall Arab fights his way to Trench Together they pull the NEW

PRISONER to his feet They take him under each arm and fall in with
the moving mass

treNCH

Weve lost our place You mustnt fall

The man almost collapses but TRENCH holds him up He and Ibrahim keep
walking the prisoner trying to keep him conscious knowing they have
to fight till daybreak now

The sound of early morning prayers drifts into the House of Stone
Sunbeams pick out bloodmarks and broken nails where prisoners have
tried to claw their way to safety Half a dozen BODIES lie crushed on
the floor those who didnt make it through the night Those who did
are ushered outside by the PRISON GUARDS into the merciless heat
TRENCH and IBRAHIM support the NEW PRISONER A fat oily looking
Prison Guard HASSAN sneers at TRENCH on his way out

HASSAN

Youve found a friend English

TRENCH ignores him blinking as he walks into the sun

EXT courtyard PRISON OMDURMAN - day

The PRISONERS collapse as they stumble into the prison courtyard
exhausted by the previous nights efforts TRENCH and IBRAHIM help the
NEW PRISONER to the rivers edge

EXT RIVERBANK courtyard PRISON OMDURMAN - day

TRENCH kneels beside the prisoner and pours some water over his face
The man opens his lips to swallow it

treNCH
Dont drink Its dirty Your body isnt strong enough

Beads of sweat shine on the bearded mans ravaged face TRENCH studies
his features wondering who he is He digs out a copper coin from his
shoe

treNCH
(To Ibrahim)
See if Hassan will sell us some drinking water

IBRAHIM sets off towards HASSAN whos busy beating the other
PRISONERS to their feet

I hope so after all this time

TRENCH stares at him in surprise

Trench by name and Trench by nature Good to meet you Feversham

despite all the pain

Not half as well as you
(Overwhelmed)

What the hell are you doing here

I have some money to bribe the guardsTheres a man waiting for
us across the riverWith camels and provisions

Keep your voice down

TRENCH looks across the courtyard to make sure no-ones watching them
HASSAN is busy bargaining with IBRAHIM over the cup of water

(Under his breath)
How much money

Two hundred

TRENCH looks hopeful for the first time in weeks
TRENCH

I knew it wasnt true The guards kept telling me our army had left
us behind How far away are they

(Regrettably)

They pulled out Over a month ago

TRENCH stares in confusion

TRENCH

Then who sent you

TRENCH doesnt understand HARRY slowly opens his fingers to reveal a
crushed white feather in his hand TRENCH stares at it in
bewilderment Then suddenly he starts to laugh full of anguish and
joy amazed by the madness of the world
EXT PRISON GATES courtyard PRISON OMDURMAN - day

The compound gates rumble open The Prisoners RELATIVES are ushered
inside kept in order by the GUARDS whips The PRISONERS limp as fast
as they can to receive any food their families have brought them
Before they can eat the GUARDS have to be paid off IDRIS first then

HASSAN and the others As the feeding frenzy breaks out we hear
Trenchs voice

EXT RIVERBANK courtyard PRISON OMDURMAN - day

We see what hes talking about now The dead bodies from the House of
Stone are dumped in a row boat The GUARDS order several PRISONERS
onto the boat with them Theyre too afraid to handle the corpses

themselves

The farthest the boat goes is a hundred yards from the opposite
shore Well have to wait until youre strong enough to swim

HARRY watches the boat drift into the middle of the river Ripples
appear as huge CROCODILES move in to feed The PRISONERS toss the
bodies in the water The corpses float for a moment then suddenly
vanish in a froth of blood

treNCH

(Smiling grimly)

You didnt think of that when you came

haRRY

I didnt think of much when I came

TRENCH looks at him still unable to believe anyone could be so
reckless and so brave

trENCH

All for a feather

(Lightly)

More than one
TRENCH looks down at the sand reflecting
trENCH

Give it to me Harry
haRRY

Why

treNCH

So I can show you it means nothing -- that if I throw it in the river
itll float away -- end up between some Crocs teeth

harry

(Smiling softly)
Not this feather Its got the measure of me Itll float back and
find me

The water laps quietly in the silence

trENCH

There were a dozen British Officers here last month Every time one of
them died the last words on his lips were Dont worry about me
lads Our boys will come and get you They never did Just you Id
say youve done enough

returns silhouetted against the sunset

I was thinking of your children Hassan Id like to help them God

and lashes him hard across the back

AASSAN lashes him again This time HARRY spins around and grabs the
whip He stares at HASSAN dangerously the frustration and
disappointment pushing him to the edge

HASSAN

(In Arabic)

He paid me to release you If you dont want to go you can rot with
him

What about you

IBRAHIM looks at TRENCH guiltily then gets up and walks towards the
dead bodies HARRY gathers TRENCH in his arms and holds him
protectively like a faithful slave HASSAN sneers and strides out of

dragged below the murky depths All is still again HARRY looks back

INT STUDY GENERAL FEVERSHAMs HOUSE LONDON - DAY

ETHNE sits across from GENERAL FEVERSHAM in the dimly lit room
Theres bright sunshine outside but very little of it gets in GENERAL
FEVERSHAM seems much older than the first time we saw him his eyes
are withdrawn his movements restless He rings the handbell
irritably

ETHNE
Dont worry about the biscuits General

gENERAL FEVERSHAM
I wanted some myself I need something sweet in the afternoons
otherwise I fall asleep

(Catching himself)
Not today of course

ETHNE tries to answer his smile but neither of them is particularly
convincing

gENERAL FEVERSHAM

Im very touched youve come all this way to tell me your good news
Jack1ll make you a wonderful husband

ETHNE

(Hiding all her doubts)

Hell be pleased to hear that
gENERAL FEVERSHAM

Im very fond of the boy

GENERAL FEVERSHAM smiles weakly and looks away Whatever they talk
about seems to come back to Harry ETHNE finally broaches the subject

ETHNE

Have you heard any news from the Sudan
GENERAL FEVERSHAM hesitates

gENERAL FEVERSHAM

An old friend of mine came to visit me yesterday Colonel Sutch
You probably remember him

ETHNE nods panicking inside sensing the old mans grief
gENERAL FEVERSHAM

He used to receive the occasional letter from Harry letting him
know that he was alright

(His voice falters)
Harry made him promise not to tell me anything unless the letters
stopped Im afraid they did Over a month ago

ETHNE looks pale She tries to hold back her tears for the Generals
sake

ETHNE
Im sure it doesnt mean anything
gENERAL FEVERSHAM

I asked some friends at the war office to make some enquiries
According to their spies all the British prisoners are dead

ETHNE cant speak The old man fights his tears as well
gENERAL FEVERSHAM

Would you like to see his letters

ETHNE

(Barely a whisper)

Im not sure I could cope right now

geNERAL FEVERSHAM

No of course not Im sorry

ETHNE looks up remembering his grief is as great as hers
ETHNE

Have you looked at them

gENERAL FEVERSHAM

Oh yes They make wonderful reading

(His face lights up briefly)

He travelled all the way from Alexandria to Suakin Across three
hundred miles of desert From there he followed the camel corp
disguised as a coolie He fought with them at Abou Klea excelled
himself by all accounts saved dozens of lives If he was still a
soldier theyd have probably given him the Victoria Cross
ETHNE

(Her eyes shining with tears)

You must be very proud

The old man nods suffering again

geNERAL FEVERSHAM

There isnt a trace of fear in the writing Thats what I find so
hard to understand That someone could be so terrified of going to

war and yet when the time comes to face it for real he embraces it
almost gratefully

ETHNE

(Sharing his guilt)

We all misjudged him

gENERAL FEVERSHAM

You only knew him a short time I had no excuse

Seeing him overcome by guilt and grief ETHNE gets up and takes his
hand GENERAL FEVERSHAM holds hers tightly

gENERAL FEVERSHAM

My son loved Jack Durrance like a brother I know hed be happy for
you Hed want you to live your lives

TRENCH cant move his jaw let alone eat HARRY chews the meat for
him When its soft between his teeth he spits it out and feeds
TRENCH with his fingers For all the primal horror theres a touching
human tenderness in the moment

Suddenly a pair of hands grab HARRY by the hair and drag him away
from TRENCH Its IDRIS The giant prison guard tears the scrap of
meat from HARRYs hands and kicks him in the ribs for good measure
Spitting out blood HARRY crawls after him no longer having to play

HARRY looks up to see a small ARAB BOY approaching him The BOY stops
as he sees HARRYs ravaged face frightened by his mad staring eyes
HARRY sees the piece of chicken in his hand and waves him over The
ARAB BOY finally kneels down and offers him the chicken bone HARRY
snatches it and gnaws on it like a hungry animal Its only when he
examines the meat making sure theres enough left for Trench that we
realise how human he still is He slips the half eaten chicken bone in
his robes and looks at the ARAB BOY gratefully The ARAB BOY holds
out some coins for him

(In Arabic)

Tell Abou Fatma to buy us food You bring me the food

He points to the other RELATIVES as if to explain The ARAB BOY nods
that he understands HARRY is about to ask him more when he suddenly
spots IDRIS walking towards them menacingly

harry

Go Thank Abou Fatma Thank him for me

The ARAB BOY gets up and walks away HARRY watches him leave already
missing the human contact As IDRIS approaches he scrambles away
reduced to his bestial state again

EXT courtyard RIVERside PRISON OMDURMAN - day

HARRY pours water over TRENCHs face

HARRY

Youre better Trench Much better You may not feel it but you
look it

TRENCH opens his eyes conscious enough for the first time in weeks
to see how much his friend has changed

treNCH
(Smiling weakly)
When Im betterWill I look as bad as you

HARRY smiles through bleeding gums and swollen cheeks The evening
prayer starts up behind them TRENCH closes his eyes in despair

treNCH
I dont think of God anymore when I hear that sound It used to give
me hope Now all I feel is dread

HARRY

Dont talk like that Were going to get you through this
treNCH

I dont want to get through this Harry What for

In the distance they hear IDRIS shouting at the prisoners driving
them back into the House of Stone

TRENCH

Theres only one thing that frightens me now The thought that the
closer I come the more desperately afraid and sure I am that all this
will end right here when I so wish I could die at home
(fighting tears)

In my own country -- in my own villageto be buried beneath the
trees I know -- in sight of the church and houses I knowbeside the
trout stream where I fished when I was a boy

(Trying to smile)

Are you laughing yet

HARRY

No Im not laughing

HARRY fights his own pain

treNCH

I dont think I can take it anymore Harry

HARRY finds it hard to argue Staring at TRENCHs ravaged face and
withered body all he can do is nod in sympathy

EXT courtyard PRISON OMDURMAN - day
HARRY sits opposite the young ARAB BOY in the courtyard Theres a

look of quiet resignation in his eyes as he stares at the small glass
vial in his hand
HARRY
(In Arabic)
Thank Abou Fatma for me Ask him to pray for us

The ARAB BOY nods sadly as if hes seeing Harry for the last time
HARRY pats him on the shoulder and gets up

INT HOUSE OF STONE PRISON OMDURMAN - night

HARRY and TRENCH lean against a wall watching as the House of Stone
fills with PRISONERS TRENCHs eyes are filled with dread

HARRY
(Quietly)
We had a visitor today

TRENCH turns and looks at him HARRY opens his hand to reveal the
small glass vial TRENCH stares at the dark liquid inside slowly
realising what it is

TRENCH

Anything would be better than this
HARRY

Are you sure

TRENCH nods his decision made
HARRY
(Slipping him the vial)

The poison will take a few hours to work You wont feel any pain

TRENCH
(Smiling grimly)
Thatll make a change

HARRY looks at him sadly then turns away preparing for the
inevitable charge from the other PRISONERS
trENCH

One last thing Harry

HARRY turns around

trENCH

-My featherId like it back

HARRY stares in silence TRENCH holds out his hand HARRY takes it As
they finally let go we see the soiled white feather in TRENCHs palm
TRENCH closes his fingers around it gratefully

treNCH

I hope it gives me as much strength as it gave you

Their eyes stay on each other full of friendship and respect Then
steeling himself TRENCH snaps the vial and starts to drink

HARRY

Half

TRENCH stops

trENCH

(Smiling sadly)

I didnt mean to be a pig about it

He holds out the vial for Harry HARRY takes it and swallows the rest
of the poison He grins at TRENCH

hARRY

What do you say we give them one last night of hell
trENCH

Ill drink to that

Shoulder first HARRY charges into the massing PRISONERS TRENCH
follows him laughing through his tears

INT HOUSE OF STONE - DAWN
Blinding sunlight The PRISONERS stumble out of the House of Stone
covered in blood from the previous nights fighting IDRIS looks down
at the broken bodies at his feet HARRY and TRENCH are amongst the
dead IDRIS prods them both with his spear making sure

IDRIS

(In Arabic)

Take them to the boats

EXT courtyard RIVERside PRISON OMDURMAN - day

A dozen BODIES are dumped one on top of the other in two funeral
boats HASSAN takes charge of one IDRIS the other

EXT BOATS RIVER OMDURMAN - day

The GUARDS hold onto the sides of the boat steadying themselves in
case a crocodile tries to ram The PRISONERS charged with throwing the
bodies overboard stare into the water terrified of the unseen
monsters lurking below

EXT hassans BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

The corpses are piled high in Hassans boat a mass of chalk white
flesh As we follow a rivulet of blood into the heap we see Harrys
face His eyes suddenly open Very much alive They move around
trying to locate Trench Above him he feels the corpses being lifted
off easing the burden on his back

EXT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

Arrows break the surface as the giant crocodiles move in

EXT hassans BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

HARRY finally glimpses TRENCH His friend is still unconscious In
tiny movements HARRY slips through the ice cold flesh that separates
them and slides over TRENCHs body trying to ensure hes thrown
overboard first

EXT idriss BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

Blood boils around the boats as more bodies are tossed overboard As
IDRIS stares into the murky depths he sees a fifteen foot monster

dragging away a translucent corpse

EXT hassans BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day
HARRY and TRENCH are the only bodies left in Hassans boat HARRY
braces himself as hes lifted into the air His body is swung out
three times and thrown overboard

EXT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

HARRY feels the warm water envelop him Any trace of paralysis the
poison has left disappears in an instant driven away by sheer
terror Through the eerie green haze he glimpses the dreamlike
silhouettes of the crocodiles feasting on the corpses dragging them
along the river bed HARRYs instincts are to swim away as fast as he
can but even now he remembers TRENCH The water above him explodes as
TRENCH is hurled in HARRY swims up to the surface and grabs hold of
his friend

EXT idriss BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

IDRIS stares curiously as he watches the two bodies drifting away The
water around them is bubbling but theres no blood Its only as he
looks more closely that IDRIS realises one of the bodies is kicking
his feet swimming away

iDRIS

(In Arabic)

Hassan Behind you

EXT HASSANs BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

HASSAN turns around to see HARRY and TRENCH disappearing with the
current He takes out his pistol

EXT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

Holding the unconscious TRENCH in his arms HARRY swims towards the
fastest point of the river hoping the current will drag him away from
the crocodiles and the boats

EXT HASSANs BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

HASSAN aims the pistol with his good hand Hes about to squeeze the

trigger when theres a loud explosion from the opposite shore A
bullet smashes through his skull and hurls him into the water

EXT opposite shore RIVER OMDURMAN - day

The MAN who fired the shot lowers his rifle Its ABOU FATMA He kicks
his camel and gallops along the riverbank trying to keep up with
HARRY and TRENCH in the water
EXT IDRISs BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

IDRIS stares after them in fury He orders the GUARDS to row into the
current and give chase

EXT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

HARRY and TRENCH tumble through the churning water the current
boiling all around them There are splashes of water as bullets
explode

EXT opposite shore RIVER OMDURMAN - day

ABOU FATMA dismounts as he sees HARRY and TRENCH being picked off He
takes up a position near the riverbank and fires at the pursuing
boat

EXT IDRISs BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

IDRIS ducks as one of his GUARDS is hit He shouts at the remaining
GUARDS to fire back at Abou Fatma

EXT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

HARRY and TRENCH keep disappearing under the water As he surfaces
briefly HARRY looks around He sees the current hurtling towards a
row of jagged rocks

EXT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

IDRIS aims at the distant figure on the riverbank and fires a volley
of shots

EXT opposite shore RIVER OMDURMAN - day

Two bullets spin ABOU FATMA round grazing him in the leg knocking
the rifle out of his hand Limping as fast as he can he takes cover
behind the camels

EXT IDRISs BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

IDRIS looks back at HARRY and TRENCH ready to pick them off Suddenly
his eyes stop He sees the jagged rocks in his path He yells at the

GUARDS to row against the current

EXT RIVER OMDURMAN - day
The current picks up speed as it hurtles towards the rocks HARRY
holds TRENCH tightly anticipating the impact The current sweeps them
right through the rocks

EXT opposite shore RIVER OMDURMAN - day

ABOU FATMA watches from the riverbank as IDRISs boat tumbles
helplessly towards the rocks

EXT IDRISs BOAT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

The GUARDS leap off the boat at the last moment but the current
sweeps them up and dashes their brains against the rocks Only IDRIS
holds on The boat breaks up all around him but protects him from the
full impact

EXT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

HARRY and TRENCH surface on the other side of the rocks Huge tree
roots jut out near the riverbank The current is still strong but its
swimmable

EXT opposite shore RIVER OMDURMAN - day

ABOU FATMA rides after the disappearing bodies

EXT GIANT TREE ROOT RIVER OMDURMAN - day

HARRY reaches out and grabs a jutting tree root With his legs clamped
around TRENCH he pulls them out of the fastest point of the current
As he looks behind him he sees IDRIS disappear under the torrent
Catching his breath HARRY starts to clamber along the root trying to
make it to the safety of the riverbank TRENCH groans fully conscious
now

harry

Were going to make it

TRENCH stares at HARRY with an almost childlike trust

harry

See if you can touch the bottom

TRENCH dips his feet under nodding as they touch the riverbed

harry
Grab the root

TRENCH grips the root HARRY swims around him

harry

Now walk to the riverbank

treNCH

My legs are broken

harry

Your legs are fine The poison paralyses the body Its worn off

Gripping the root TRENCH starts to walk against the current the
water flowing up to his neck Slowly the river shallows HARRY looks
relieved as his friend finally tumbles onto the riverbank and
collapses Hes about to follow him when suddenly a pair of hands
shoot out of the water and grab him around the neck Its IDRIS Hes
also managed to clamber his way to safety With a howl of rage he
pulls HARRYs face under the water

HARRY kicks and flails With one huge hand IDRIS keeps him under the
surface with the other he holds onto the giant tree root HARRY tries
to loosen his grip but he isnt strong enough He reaches down into
the riverbed and gropes around until he finds a rock He grinds it
into IDRISs wrist like a pummel stone

IDRIS whips his hand away in pain HARRY is instantly sucked out of
his grasp The current smashes him headlong into another root
downriver IDRIS stares at his escaped prey in fury His anger clouds
his reason He lets go of his own root and lets the current drag him
to HARRYs

EXT RIVERbank OMDURMAN - day

HARRY drags himself towards the riverbank Hes only a few yards away
when IDRISs hands grab him again HARRY turns around swinging and
catches IDRIS on the jaw Both of them tumble in the water

They wrestle beneath the surface then shoot up again tearing at each
other like wild animals IDRIS grabs HARRY by the hair and slams his
face down on his knee smashing his nose The searing pain staggers
HARRY He tries to crawl away but IDRIS stamps on his back
flattening him He drops to his knees and grinds HARRYs face into
the riverbed

As he pulls him back up by the hair we see HARRYs mangled features -
- a mask of blood eyes staring out jaws hanging open in defeat For
a moment time seems to slow then suddenly shaking his head free
HARRY screams a savage primal cry and drives his elbow back into
IDRISs face shattering bone and cartilege

DRIS falls back stunned HARRY has his chance to get away but hes
ot interested now He wades after IDRIS an expression of pure
ncontrollable rage in his eyes As IDRIS tries to pick himself up
ARRY slams both fists into his mouth smashing his teeth down his
hroat

aoe pH

Its IDRISs turn to look scared He tries to crawl away but the
bloody faced demon is on him in seconds ramming his head back under
the water IDRIS manages to kick him away briefly but it only enrages
HARRY He comes back at IDRIS with a large rock between his hands
cracking his face open

And still he isnt finished Sitting astride the gurgling prison
guard HARRY raises both arms as high as theyll go and smashes the
rock into IDRISs face again and again The guards blood splatters
all over him but HARRY hardly seems to notice Hes gripped by a
savage primordial fury Everything hes suffered has built up to this
point Hes at his highest and lowest ebb His hands whirr up and
down his eyes glow feverishly his lips curl in a terrifying sneer

Strong arms grab him from behind but HARRY ignores them hammering
away Hes beyond hatred beyond compassion face to face with his
deepest darkest self Again the arms try to pull him off but HARRY
brushes them aside The blood and tears stream down his cheeks He
howls like an animal His hands finally slow as his arms reach
exhaustion

This time ABOU FATMA manages to pull him off HARRY collapses in his
arms and weeps like a baby finally breaking out of the darkness no
longer sure who or what he is anymore ABOU FATMA holds him tightly
hushing him comforting him understanding

EXT country lane bintree england - day

A primal silence Mist hovers over the emerald fields In the distance
a carriage approaches As it draws nearer we see HARRY sitting in
the back His scars have healed but his eyes have the far away look
of someone whos seen too much The outlines of the village church
appear through the fog HARRY hears a dog barking

HARRY

(To the Driver)
Could you stop here

EXT church bintree - day

The barking grows louder as HARRY enters the churchyard He sees a
Collie tied to a post Its Dermods dog HARRY bends down and
strokes the animal Then he looks up through the open church door
INT church bintree - day

At first HARRY doesnt see ETHNE She sits quietly in one of the
Church pews Its only as she hears his footsteps that she turns
around Her eyes stop still She stares at him in silence taking in
the ravages of time All the diffidence and boyish charm she remembers
have long since disappeared In their place theres an inner
strength and confidence

ETHNE

Everyone said how much youd changed I didnt believe them

HARRY

Do I look that bad

ETHNE

Trench came to see me last week He looked a good deal worse than you
HARRY

Hes suffered more

ETHNE

That isnt what he told me

She stares at him with quiet pride

ETHNE

May I have it back

HARRY

That isnt why I came

ETHNE
Id still like it back

(She smiles sadly)

I have three of them Id like four

HARRY stares at her then takes out the fourth feather
HARRY

Im almost sorry to let it go Its brought me a lot of luck these
past few months

ETHNE takes the feather unable to look at him She stares at it in
silence

ETHNE

When did you get back
HARRY

Two weeks ago

She looks hurt that its taken him so long to come and see her but
she knows she has no right to expect more

ETHNE

Im glad you did what you did on your own without anyones help Im
glad for you Harry

hARRY

I did nothing on my own You were with me the whole time
The tears begin to shine in her eyes

ETHNE

Youve heard our news

hARRY

Yes

ETHNE nods unable to continue

HARRY
I didnt

come here to change your mind

(With quiet dignity)

The most
could do
wouldnt

ETHNE is
crack of

I hoped for -- and I hoped for it every day -- was that I
enough to save the memory of what we had So that you
always be ashamed of the time we spent together

too ashamed of herself to answer him Her eyes drift toa
sunlight on the church wall glinting through the stained

glass windows

HARRY

What are

ETHNE

you thinking

Youd laugh if I told you

harry

That might not be a bad thing

ETHNE

I was thinking Id get up and leave when that patch of sunlight
disappeared So far its been quite resilient

She smiles gently For a moment theyre the Harry and Ethne of old

ETHNE

I passed by your appartment the other day

HARRY

(Surprised)

When

ETHNE

When you didnt come and see me

(She smiles sadly)

I was in London for the day

When I finally drove by your lights were off

It took me hours to pluck up the courage
HARRY

Ive hardly been out since I got back

ETHNE

It was last Friday Between five and six

HARRY

(Pausing)

Id gone to see my father

ETHNE

(Smiling ironically)

Someone must be watching over us

The sunlight lingers precariously on the wall

ETHNE

It will pass Youll meet someone soon Then you and her and Jack and
I will sit over tea and chatter politely as if there was never
anything between us

HARRY

That wont happen

ETHNE

It has to happen

(The tears fill her eyes)

Because I love you Harryand I cant I cant

The sunlight on the wall finally fades ETHNE wipes her tears and gets
up to leave As she tries to walk past him HARRY takes her in his
arms She doesnt resist If anything shes relieved They stay like
that for a moment holding each other unable to do anything else We
feel their desperate longing but theres a self imposed wall that

keeps them apart ETHNE pulls away gently

ETHNE
Ill take you to the station

He nods

HARRY

I wanted to look in on Jack Ill leave him a note
ETHNE

(Considering)

No hed love to see you Hes staying at the vicarage Its on the
way

Theyre polite around each other now like strangers ETHNE slips past
him with an awkward smile HARRY waits before he follows her They
walk down the aisle several feet apart

INT DURRANCEs room vicarage glenalla - day

DURRANCE sits at a table knotting his tie Theres a determination in
his eyes as if the smallest activity has become a battle to be won
Suddenly he hears the noise of Ethnes carriage outside His face
lights up He feels his way towards the window

The carriage door takes a long time to open DURRANCE stares
curiously Finally he hears footsteps on the gravel Theyre heavier
than he expected They stop a moment DURRANCE knows whoever it is is
staring up at him in the window He looks thoughtful now as if he
knows who it is

He turns away from the window and finds a chair He sits facing the
door checking to make sure the carafe of Scotch and the crystal
glasses are within easy reach The footsteps climb the stairs Theres
a knock on the door

DURRANCE
Come in
HARRY enters He stops as he sees his friend DURRANCEs face has

softened from inactivity His skin seems pale compared to Harrys
coarse sunburnt features

DURRANCE

Its good to see you Harry
HARRY

(Quietly impressed)

How did you know

DURRANCE

A calculated guess

(He grins)

Scotch alright

hARRY

Perfect

DURRANCE

Ive got to cut down on the stuff Im putting on weight
hARRY

You look good

DURRANCE

Not as good as you Im sure

HARRY watches his friend taking the carafe pouring two perfect
glasses Everything Durrance does is designed to show him hes
alright that theres nothing to pity

DURRANCE

(Handing him the drink)

I heard Ethnes carriage outside
hARRY

Shes giving me a ride to the station
DURRANCE

Why didnt she come up

hARRY
(He knows the question isnt as casual as it sounds)

I think she wanted to give us a few minutes alone
DURRANCE

Do we need a few minutes alone

Even though hes smiling the air is thick with tension
hARRY

I came to thank you Jack

DURRANCE

For what

hARRY

For standing by me

DURRANCE

If youre talking about the feathers I wasnt there

hARRY

Willoughby told me you were He said youd tried to talk them out of
it

DURRANCE hesitates
DURRANCE

You dont owe me anything Harry The wedding isnt for another month
Ethnes free to make up her own mind

HARRY

You dont owe me anything either Jack And shes made up her mind
You should trust her judgement

A long silence DURRANCE is too proud to respond HARRY stares at his
friend regretting the wall between them

HARRY

Id better go Ill miss my train Ill come and see you soon
He finishes his drink and gets up
DURRANCE

Have another one

hARRY

cant Jack

DURRANCE

Please

His voice is softer now more conciliatory

DURRANCE

The friendship was the best thing about that place Its the one thing
I havent been able to hang onto

Its his way of asking Harry to stay HARRY sits again

DURRANCE

Ive become like one of those old soldiers we used to laugh at
Forcing my stories on everyone Enough medals on my uniform to light
up a Christmas tree

(Filling their glasses)

Have they given you back your commission

HARRY

They havent acknowledged me in any way

DURRANCE

I suppose it wouldnt be the British Army if they admitted their
mistakes

HARRY
I dont know if it was a mistake I was never a real soldier like you
DURRANCE

A real soldier doesnt come back in a hospital ship
(Raising his glass)
To Castelton and all the others we left behind

HARRY watches his friend down his whisky sensing the guilt and pain
inside

HARRY

(Reassuring him gently)

You did everything you could

DURRANCE

You saw it happen

HARRY

From a distance I remember the entire British Square retreating in
perfect order and then these two lunatics charging out to save their
friend

(He smiles affectionately)

I remember thinking there wasnt a bullet in the world that could stop
you that day

DURRANCE

(Ironically)

Except my own

hARRY

You obviously werent meant to die You certainly tried your best
DURRANCE chuckles close to tears holding them back

DURRANCE

Its hard to talk like this with anyone else They all want to know

how many people youve killed but the moment you mention the friends
youve lost their eyes glaze over

hARRY

They werent there
DURRANCE

No

(A beat)

Do you ever miss the desert Harry
hARRY

Im glad Im home

DURRANCE

It was the best time of my life Whenever anyone had a problem they
came to me I never felt so needed

(He smiles)

Maybe we should change places

HARRY isnt sure what he means DURRANCE tops up their glasses
DURRANCE

You remember the first time we led a cavalry charge in public
hARRY

You wiped the floor with me Most of my horses ended up in the
bandstand

DURRANCE

Ethne was watching

hARRY

(Hesitating)

Thats right

DURRANCE

Wed met her the previous night at the regimental ball
HARRY

I remember
DURRANCE

You should You were the only one she danced with
HARRY smiles but doesnt say anything

DURRANCE

Ive never been so jealous I stayed up all night brooding The next
day I was determined to show you up -- prove to her I was the better
soldier

HARRY

(Affectionately)

You were always the better soldier

DURRANCE

And it still didnt make a difference

(He smiles wistfully)

She was the first person I looked for in the crowd and she was
staring at you Everyone else was applauding me and she was staring
at you

(A beat)

Im not sure if anythings changed

HARRY cant speak He knows what DURRANCE is saying

DURRANCE

(Raising his glass)

To us Harry

He leans over grinning and touches Harrys glass

DURRANCE

To you

her FATHER TRENCH waits until shes safely inside before he removes
his hands from Harrys eyes HARRY looks around hoping to see

show Slowly the CROWD outside thins until only HARRY TRENCH and
WILLOUGHBY remain

HARRY has one last look for Durrance still hoping against hope then
