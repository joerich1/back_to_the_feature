FADE IN
INT PRIVATE SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

JAKE COLLIER wades through throngs of people crowding a
school gym filled with booths clowns and fun games for kids

Jakes dressed respectable but still carries himself like a
guy who works in jeans and gets dirt under his nails

He sidles up to an attractive WOMAN waiting by an airbag
jungle gym filled with bouncing children her back to him

JAKE
Hello beautiful are you available
Id kill for a date with you

The woman KARA turns Dark hair and eyes with a dash of
the exotic Holds up a hand showing her wedding ring

KARA
Sorry already taken

JAKE
Too bad Your husband a large man

KARA
Unfortunately no

Jake winces because he is of course her husband

JAKE
Ouch Okay I give Can we go now

KARA
The more tired he gets the deeper
he sleeps which means more private
time for us Without interruption

CONNOR their son bounces like mad inside the air gym

JAKE
Good job son Keep going

SCOTT WALTERS a well-fed man without a shred of any
obvious honest sweat on his person approaches

WALTERS
Jake How’s business these days

JAKE
Scott It’s good no complaints
WALTERS
I’1ll bet The recession must have
been a real boon for you

MARCUS LELAND same age and air of rich entitlement as
Walters chimes in on the conversation

LELAND
Is it true what Scott says that
no car is safe from you

JAKE
Well Marcus if it’s paid for it’s
safe from me If it’s not paid for-

WALTERS
You steal it back

JAKE
It’s not stealing because I return
a product to its rightful owner

LELAND
But you can “take” any car from
anyone at any time Anywhere

JAKE
That is what I do

The other two men look at each other giggle Kara doesn’t
like the direction this is going

LELAND
Well Show him I dare you

Walters holds up an iphone A picture of a choice Porsche

LELAND
His pride and joy Half a million
dollars of automobile Stays in the
garage he rarely takes it out

WALTERS
A gentleman’s wager Five hundred
dollars you can’t take my car

LELAND
I’1l double it A thousand Id
love to see you at work
KARA
I’m sorry but no Breaking and
entering a private residence is
against the law even for repo men

WALTERS
Oh I won’t press charges If he
can do it I’1l even go on record

LELAND
It’s all in fun For the challenge

JAKE
Can I see the picture again

The men grin and clap Walters hands Jake his iphone

JAKE
I couldn’t take your money for
this If you were to donate it
however to the school-

KARA
Jake please I’m sorry but this is
very inappropriate No

CONNOR
Mommy

Connor appears and jumps into his mother’s arms laughing

JAKE
When she’s right she’s right
Gotta pass on this bet sorry

WALTERS

home security I see my wife waving
for me Good talking with you

Jake hands the iphone back The men bid good-bye walk off

JAKE

MRS WALTERS

ask where are you from originally

KARA

MRS WALTERS
Oh I’m sorry I thought you had a
different cultural background

KARA
In a way my mother was
Argentinian my father American

MRS WALTERS

KARA
When I was very young My father
was attached to the embassy there
When he retired we moved to Omaha
and that’s where I grew up

MRS WALTERS
They met at an embassy Sounds so
lovely like in a romance novel

Leland and his FAMILY walk out of the school along with

INT JAKE’S TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT

Jake drives the hilly streets of San Francisco Connor in the
middle zonked out asleep head on Jake’s shoulder Kara
stares out her window steam nearly coming out her ears

JAKE
By the way I love you
(beat)
You even want to know how I did it

KARA
You backtracked his cell number to
find out where he lived broke into
his Cadillac and used his automatic
garage door opener to get inside

JAKE
Yeah Don’t you think it was kinda
you know cool

KARA
“Cool” Jake that’s childish
JAKE
He was dangling it out there like a
big shot Daddy Warbucks I hate
that shit-

KARA
Grow up You’re a parent now

JAKE
I know I’m a parent but I’m also
still me the guy you met and fell
in love with and-

KARA
That guy the guy who used to steal
things and get into trouble He’s
not who you are anymore You have a
family now Be responsible What if
he changed his mind and decided to
press charges What then What if
something went wrong What would
Connor and I do if something
happened to you while you’re doing
something stupid and against the
law like you just did

JAKE
Nothing’s going to happen to me

KARA
Everyone thinks that until it
happens Life can change in a
second And you want your defining
moment to be about proving a point
to some rich asshole Grow up

Nothing said for awhile after that

baseball bat out of sight underneath

here we delivered it That Spider

Jake gestures to a little guy SPIDER hidden behind the
bikers Spider sports a couple black eyes Brody nods Spider
swallows about ready to shit a brick

BRODY

JAKE
Doesn’t have to be Way I see it
you don’t really care about the
bike too much right You have a
bunch of bikes one more or less
won’t make a difference

BRODY
This one does

JAKE
Not the bike The saddlebags Luiz

The bikers stiffen Brody’s eyes glint Luiz slips out

JAKE
Who cares about a shitty bike But
the bags were full and so I kept
‘em for the rightful owner

BRODY
How much do you want

JAKE
For what The bags Nothin’ I had
paper on the bike Not the
saddlebags or the contents thereof

Spider breathes a sigh of relief

BRODY
You didn’t look

JAKE

Brody glances at the saddlebags
BRODY
I owe you My name’s Brody if you
ever need a favor send word

With a nod the bikers stroll out Luiz breathes a big
of relief makes the sign of the cross

JAKE

OLSON
We found this in a trash can
couple blocks away from the mall
ID cash credit cards still
inside My experience when someone
dumps their personal effects and
walks out onto the Golden Gate
Bridge it’s because they don’t
intend to return

JAKE
No No-

OLSON
I’m sorry Jake but she wasn’t
abducted or attacked She walked
out onto the bridge on her own
power and didn’t walk back off

JAKE
Is there footage of her jumping

OLSON
The cameras can’t cover every-

JAKE
You don’t because she didn’t She
wouldn’t She loved me our son-
OLSON
People leave loved ones behind all
the time I’m sorry We have boats
sweeping the coast but often the
bodies get caught in the current-—

JAKE
She wasn’t suicidal She was fine
she was happy she-

OLSON
What about the nine-one-one calls

JAKE
(after a moment)
That was a long time ago Her
hormones were out of balance-

Olson nods to Trask He hits a button

KARA (0S)

Send help he’s trying to kill me
everyone’s trying to kill me Don’t
touch me Leave me alone

Jake closes his eyes at that

OLSON
Nine calls in four months each one
sounding worse than before that’s
a little more than hormonal less
than a year into a marriage

JAKE
The pregnancy wasn’t planned she
originally didn’t want to have
children she was afraid
worried she wouldn’t be a good
mother the usual But in spite of
our precautions she got pregnant
and it freaked her out Her
hormones went haywire She couldn’t
sleep and when she did she’d have
nightmares Wake up screaming
Freak when I’d touch her call the
police everyone We hadn’t been
married for very long and there was
a lot of anxiety about it and
parenthood and everything

Olson gestures with his head Trask leaves the room

OLSON
I believe you The investigating
officers then believed you Which
is why we’re pretty certain that we
know what happened to your wife

JAKE
She’s Catholic it’s a sin she-

OLSON
Catholics sin all the time I know
I was an altar boy

JAKE
She was happy We were happy

Olson presses a button Playback from a security camera

OLSON

MOWERS
Copy of the police report And the
footage you asked for

He presses a button on a laptop Jake watches a playback from
a security camera of his last conversation with his wife

MOWERS
Some of this is from the cops some
from the mall they didn’t hand
over everything Got a guy I work
with real good at this stuff he
dug it up and culled together
different angles from the cameras

Screen breaks into different angles Jake watches it again
JAKE
Right there can you stop it
or something What’s she doing

MOWERS
Wondered about that myself Watched
it a bunch of times She’s taking
her wedding ring off

JAKE
Why

MOWERS
You tell me

JAKE
I don’t know We were fine

MOWERS
(after a moment)
Okay

JAKE
I’m telling you the truth

MOWERS
Okay So she leaves you here We
got film of her going into the
ladies She’s there for an hour

Mowers fiddles with the footage New stuff comes up

MOWERS
We got her coming out again
Exiting the mall here

JAKE
Can I get a copy of this

MOWERS
I’1l email you everything And I
gotta ask The other footage Her
walking to the bridge

JAKE
What about it

MOWERS
I ain’t no cop but I been doing
this a long time Report’s pretty
clear There’s a reason cameras are
on that path

(MORE )

MOWERS (CONTD)
They also have ‘em at the favored
spots on the bridge but they don’t
catch everyone who-

JAKE
She didn’t jump

MOWERS
(after a moment)
Well she walked onto the bridge
and didn’t walk off So if she
didn’t jump off it-

JAKE
Someone picked her up

MOWERS
I can get my guy to check cameras
on both ends if she’s in a car and
visible we’ll find her

JAKE
Do it Whatever it takes Wait
look Back this one up this angle
here That one

Onscreen a high angle shot of Kara walking toward Jake
she halts frozen in her tracks Turns away from him

JAKE
See it looks like she’s looking at
me but really it’s over to the
side at that guy there

Onscreen just on the edge of the camera a MAN ina
black duster and a dark cowboy hat behind Jake just
entering the mall He also stops
JAKE
See She knew him That’s why she
got freaked You see it

The Man stops when Jake approaches Kara Watches them

MOWERS
Okay

Mowers clearly believes Jake’s grasping at straws

JAKE
Is there a better shot of this guy

MOWERS
Not in this stuff Weekend at the
mall it was packed

JAKE
Go to your guy I want a picture of
his face And see if there’s any
footage of him anywhere else
traffic cameras can he do that

MOWERS
He can do that but it’s gonna cost-

JAKE
You want another check

MOWERS
Just so we’re clear You think your
wife saw a guy she knew an ex-
boyfriend maybe She took her
wedding ring off left you dumped
her ID walked miles out onto the
bridge on foot alone Disappeared

JAKE
She didn’t jump

MOWERS
Say she didn’t maybe she met with
this guy her ex Right Once you
find her what are you gonna do
drag her back

JAKE
I just want to find her I’1l
figure out the rest after that

OLSON

If it were me I’d do everything in
my power sure That includes
facing some ugly realities about
the what where and why of it
Because I have a son who’s gonna
have an even harder time dealing
and he’s gonna need me to help him

Olson fishes his keys out of his pocket Opens his car door

OLSON
You do what you got to do I don’t
begrudge you that But if you don’t
tell him sooner or later he’1l
figure it out on his own You don’t
want that you know

Olson climbs into the car

OLSON
Eventually we all have to face hard
truths in life Jake

Puts it down Thinks Runs through the pictures on his laptop

INT JAKE’S TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT

Dusk hits as Jake zips through the streets Pictures of the
Tattooed Man strewn everywhere on his seat

Jake parks at a meter on Howard Avenue Down the sidewalk
the barbershop from the photos Jake compares it to the
pictures Jake looks at his bat on the seat next to him
Leaves the bat and jumps out

EXT SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Rough neighborhood from the apartment buildings to the cars
parked along the street to the garbage on the sidewalk

In front of the shop Jake takes note of a cherry CHEVY LOW-
RIDER shiny black with detailed flames

Nice car Out in the open owner obviously not concerned
about anyone fucking with it even in this neighborhood

A SKINNY OLD LADY carefully pushes a cart full of cans and
bottles by Jake The cart is packed tight and hard to move

A wheel hits a crack TIPS The whole thing topples down with
a crash Kids down the street cheer

The Skinny Old Lady crosses herself taking a moment of
prayer Jake picks up her cart Helps her set it upright She
chatters at him in Spanish thanking him profusely

JAKE
It’s okay no problem

Jake peers through the store window inside the barbershop
Eight barber chairs lined up full with CUSTOMERS

More men sit in chairs to the side either there for a
haircut or for the conversation

Jake steps toward the front door A hand pulls his sleeve

THE SKINNY OLD LADY pulls at him chattering Obviously
doesn’t want him to go into there

JAKE
I don’t speak Spanish I’m sorry

OLD LADY
No go there No Not for you

Jake looks at her a second then opens the front door

INT BARBERSHOP - NIGHT

Jake steps inside Barbers work on their subjects Spectators
smirk at the white boy who must be lost A chair empties The
BARBER dusts it off looks at Jake expectantly

JAKE
I don’t need a haircut I need
help I’m looking for this man

Jake holds up the picture of the Tattooed Man Conversation
in the shop dies in an instant The Barber shakes his head

JAKE
Look I’1l pay for a haircut just
tell me where I can find him

The Barber backs away shaking his head Jake shows the
picture to others in the shop who all avoid looking at him

JAKE
Anyone do you know this man
I’1l pay for the information

CHUCHO a smiling Mexican in slacks and a button shirt
obviously the manager steps out of the back

CHUCHO
Can I help you sir

JAKE
I’m looking for this man

Jake holds up the photo Chucho doesn’t even look at it

CHUCHO
I’m sorry sir I don’t know him

JAKE
He came in here two days ago

CHUCHO
Youre mistaken sir This is my
shop I’m here all day and night
and I’ve never seen him

JAKE
Maybe one of your workers or
customers knows or saw him

CHUCHO
No I would know They don’t know
him He’s never been in here

JAKE
I have a picture of him walking in
here time-stamped and dated

CHUCHO
You’re mistaken That man never
came into this shop

JAKE
(after a moment)
Youre lying

CHUCHO
I’m sorry you feel that way sir
Now I’m running a business here and
it’s probably best if you go-

JAKE
No I’m not going anywhere You’re
going to tell me what I want to
know or I’m gonna call the police

CHUCHO
In this neighborhood it takes time
for them to get here If I were
you I’d be on my way before I got
into trouble Or I could have my
friend here escort you out

RAOUL a large fat man sitting in a chair slowly stands
Raoul puts his hand on Jake’s shoulder Jake knocks it off

JAKE
Don’t make a bad mistake

A barber throws a SMOCK over Jake’s head pulling it down
tight pinning his arms trapping him

Raoul HITS Jake in the head and gut again and again Jake
goes down to his knees Blood stains the smock

Raoul reaches down frees Jake’s head Picks him up holds
him tight from behind Jake’s face is a red bloody mess

Chucho steps close eyeballing Jake Reaches into his pocket
Pulls out a STRAIGHT RAZOR Holds it to Jake’s cheek

CHUCHO
You should know that where I come
from it’s a terrible insult to call
another man a liar It’s not
something one should do casually
It can get a man’s throat cut

Chucho barks Spanish to one of men The man pulls out a
bottle of tequila tosses it Chucho catches it in one hand

CHUCHO
But I will take pity I can see
youre mentally disturbed just like
most white men I’ve known Trying
to decide which sports car to
drive which fancy college to send
your kids to counting your money
and shit like that it drives all
you white people crazy

He takes the cap of the tequila bottle off with his teeth
Puts the mouth of the bottle to Jake’s lips Raoul holds
Jake’s head so he can’t move Forces Jake to drink He gags

CHUCHO
And when you get crazy you get
paranoid start thinking the

spic gardener is ruining your
roses the spic maid is stealing
your jewelry the spic barber
you do not know is lying to you A
disease all you white people have
I have sympathy for it I do But
there are limits to my patience

Chucho takes the bottle away from Jake’s mouth Pours more of
it over Jake’s head and shirt until he stinks of it

CHUCHO
So go ahead and call the police
And when they come to take
“statements” every brown-skinned
man in this place will tell them
that this drunk white boy stumbled
in looking for trouble and we
kindly escorted him out the door
because we don’t want trouble here
And he left in good shape And they
will believe us Understand

Chucho hands the bottle to someone Holds the razor back up

CHUCHO
I won’t cut you this time But
should you get more liquid courage
decide to return I won’t be so
understanding Comprende’

Chucho waits a beat for an answer None comes He raises an
eyebrow Brings the razor close to Jake’s eye

Jake nods that he understands Chucho smiles

Chucho barks Spanish One of the men holds up a cell phone
takes a picture of Jake’s face

CHUCHO
Now I have your picture I will
remember who you are
Chucho nods Raoul manhandles Jake out the front door

EXT SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Raoul hauls Jake down a few doors from the barbershop Dumps
him hard on the sidewalk right into some trash cans Spits

Reaches down takes the smock off of him Shakes it out
Walks away The Old Lady shakes her head leans down to Jake

OLD LADY
I tole’ you Not for you

Jake crawls out of the garbage Stumbles to his truck
INT JAKE’S OFFICE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Jake jumps Sees who it is calms down

JAKE
What are you doing here
LUIZ
I finally got the Mercedes what
happened You’ve been drinking

JAKE

LUIZ
Who did this to you

JAKE
The cops think Kara’s dead think
she committed suicide The skip-
tracer I hired thinks she’s dead
hell I bet even my sitter thinks
she’s dead I’m banging around like
a madman getting my ass kicked
trying to find out what happened
because I don’t think she
You’re Catholic too right

LUIZ
Yes

JAKE
Youd never take your own life

LUIZ
No It is a grievous sin for
Catholics very bad I could never
do that I couldn’t

JAKE
Do you think Kara would

LUIZ
No I don’t She was pious more
than me She’d never do that

Jake stands Wipes his face

JAKE
She wouldn’t And until I see proof
that she did real proof I wont
believe otherwise Because she’s my
wife and I know her better than
anyone else She didn’t jump She
walked onto that bridge and didn’t
walk off so someone picked her up
somebody took her and I won’t stop
until I find out who it was

LUIZ
Is there anything-

JAKE
No Luiz It’s okay Go on home

Luiz hesitates a moment Finally leaves Jake there in the
bathroom Jake looks at his hands bloody and shaking

He can just make out the faded “I LOVE YOU” note

hitched didn’t want to have a kid

handle they take off She’s gone

note on his hand The handwriting is the same

He pulls out his blackberry gets on the internet Finds a
Spanish to English Translator Enters the words into it

Translation reads “FATE”

Jake takes a picture of the note with his phone Glances
around A glint catches his eye Tucked up in the toilet
paper dispenser A WEDDING RING

His wife’s wedding ring He pulls it out of there

Everything hits home hard

The bathroom door opens Jake freezes Footsteps Someone
enters the stall next to him Relieves herself

Jake inches out of the stall Walks out of the bathroom into
THE HALLWAY

and freezes Written on the hallway wall opposite the door
in dark masculine strokes is a note in permanent marker

It reads “OBLIGACION”

It’s obviously new and also obviously NOT his wife’s
handwriting He compares it to his tattoo just to be sure

Below that word is another note in Kara’s handwriting
It readsF8”

BRODY
Get out of the way Pedro

Brody pushes past Luiz goes to the door to the warehouse
Pulls out a knife Disappears into the dark Jake and Luiz
wait holding their breath Jake grips his bat

BRODY
Turn the light back on

Luiz flips the light on to reveal

TRASK the camera tech from Olson’s office in the doorway

EXT JAKE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jake skids to a stop in his drive Written in spray paint on
the front of his house

The word “MUERTE”

Jake jumps out runs

INSIDE THE HOUSE

» The whole place is trashed and torn up

INT PETERSON HOUSE - NIGHT

Jake paces the front hall Luiz sits dazed not far Amy
huddles with her parents MR and MRS PETERSON (40s) in the
living room Obviously scared

A quiet knock on the door Brody sitting by the front
window cocks the shotgun Jake looks out opens the door

Detective Olson enters Glances around

OLSON
Where’s your boy

JAKE
Sleeping upstairs

OLSON
Pretty damn lucky your kid was at
the sitter’s house with her folks
and not yours wouldn’t you say

After a moment Jake nods

OLSON
Let me deal with these folks

Olson joins the Petersons in the other room shows his badge
and talks fast and quiet After a moment the Petersons
numbly go upstairs Amy shoots worried glances at Jake Olson
returns Gives Jake a measured look

OLSON
I think they’d appreciate it if you
were gone in the morning

JAKE
We will be

OLSON
You got a safe place you can go

BRODY
Hells yes

OLSON
I wasn’t asking you was I
(beat)
I suppose I should skip the part
where I rip you a new asshole for
tearing the shit out of my town
and with a known felon to boot

JAKE
You got the pictures video
everything I sent You look at it

OLSON
Yes It should come as no surprise
that you are wanted by authorities
for questioning

LUIZ
We will be arrested put in jail

OLSON
If we could prove definitively that
you three put two men in the morgue
and five in the hospital destroyed
their place of business and blew up
a car as a coup de grace then yes
Id put you in jail immediately
Cops are good like that But no
one’s talking so right now you’re
only wanted for questioning

BRODY
Hey we didn’t kill those two
dudes they iced themselves

OLSON
(to Brody)
I’m pretending I don’t notice the
illegally modified firearm you’re
holding because I’m generous like
that but the more you talk the
harder it is for me to be generous

LUIZ
It’s true they take own life

OLSON

(after a moment)
The two stiffs were members of a
gang called Mano Negra de Muerte
and they put a red hot target on
your ass Mexico-based extremely
violent traffic in drugs
extortion nearly every illegal
racket there is Best guess your
wife was attached to them in some
capacity ran away they found her
and she went back Willingly

JAKE
That’s insane why would she-

OLSON
She did it for you for your son
You saw the footage She saw this
Dedos at the mall first thing she
did was take off her wedding ring
Pretended she didn’t know you She
was protecting you that much is
clear from the conversation in the
video According to a buddy of mine
in the gangs unit Mano Negra is
brutal when it comes to their own
and what they perceive as
disloyalty If they’d known she was
married if they’d known she had a
son they’d have killed all of you

JAKE
That’s why she never wanted to have
kids why she was so upset when she
got pregnant why she
OLSON
She must have known this moment
might someday come

JAKE
What can you do

OLSON
I can arrange for protection for
you and your son but-

JAKE
What about her

OLSON
(after a moment)
Nothing I can do Or Interpol As
far as the law is concerned she
left of her own free will

JAKE
You know that’s not true

OLSON
I know it but I can’t prove it And
even if I could she’s technically
not a citizen so-

JAKE
Fuck We just leave her to be
killed or worse What does Mano
Negra do to runaways

OLSON
(after a moment)
You don’t want to know

Nothing said for a minute Jake takes a deep breath

JAKE
Okay I appreciate your help

OLSON
What are you going to do

JAKE
Wait for my son to wake up When he
does I’m going to give him a hug
and tell him everything

How can I look my son in the eye if
I don’t try to save his mother from
that

OLSON
I guess you can’t I know I

automatic rifle and clips

JAKE
A guitar case seriously

ERNESTO
The young men who are my customers
often enjoy the reference so who
am I to judge To be honest it is
the perfect size for carrying an
automatic rifle and few think
twice when they see a man walk down
the street with it on his back

Jake checks the action on the M16
ERNESTO

Archaic that weapon I could get
you a Uzi which is much smaller-

JAKE
I’ve never fired an Uzi so no I
already know how to use this

ERNESTO
These are for your own personal
edification Not for resale

JAKE
How much

A moment Ernesto holds up seven fingers

ERNESTO
That’s a friend price

Jake pulls out a wad of bills counts it out Hands it over
Jake jerks his chin at Javier’s black duster

JAKE
How much for the jacket

ERNESTO
It’s his favorite so I don’t think-

JAKE
Say when

Jake peels off hundreds one two three four five
Javier takes the duster off hands it over Jake puts it on

ERNESTO
Pistols automatic weapon I
only agreed because you have shown
me favor in the past and in your
youth demonstrated yourself to be
a civilized person no small
accomplishment in the world in
which we live in but I must
confess Jacob that I am consumed
with curiosity

Jake loads up the two pistols sticks them in his belt

JAKE
About what

ERNESTO
Whom you’re declaring war upon

JAKE
Ernesto you know I’m strictly non-
confrontational

ERNESTO
That was my recollection It would
be decidedly inconvenient for me if
you were to make use of these tools
within my area of influence

Jake closes the guitar case snaps it shut tight

JAKE
One last thing maybe you can help

ERNESTO
Of course you have only to ask

Jake flashes the picture of Dedos the Tattooed Man

JAKE
Id like to find him

Javier glances at Ernesto Jake catches the look

ERNESTO

He is not someone you want to find
JAKE

I do
ERNESTO

I cannot help you with this

JAKE
I find that hard to believe You
know where everything and everyone
in this town is

ERNESTO
It is true that I am blessed with
many friendships But this I
cannot I’m sorry

A moment Javier fidgets

JAKE
Me too

Jake grabs the guitar case Turns Takes a few steps

Tosses the case to Javier who catches it in surprise with
both hands Jake pulls out both Berettas fast

Points one at Ernesto who is in the process of raising his
own pistol Ernesto freezes Points the other at Javier who
also freezes case in hand

JAKE
Gonna shoot me in the back take
the money and the guns Ernesto

ERNESTO
Of course not Jacob you
misunderstand me I only-

JAKE
Drop the pistol Now

Ernesto drops the gun

JAKE
This guy Dedos is his name right
Where can I find him Tell me

ERNESTO
Jacob this isn’t civilized

JAKE
I left civilized life behind

Jake takes a step sticks the barrel of his pistol into
Javiers mouth Javiers eyes widen

JAKE
Your nephew isn’t going to have a
good head for anything at all if
you don’t tell me what I want to
know right now Where is he

ERNESTO
You slander our friendship

JAKE
I’m going to splatter it you and
your nephew all over these walls in
three seconds Three Two

Jake squeezes the trigger nearly firing Javier squeals
ERNESTO
Wait Dedos owns a club He makes
his rounds when he is in town the
same time every afternoon

INT CRAPPY MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

Ernesto and Javier are handcuffed together to the shitty
toilet pipes towels stuffed into their mouths

JAKE
I’m going to borrow your jeep

Jake reaches into Ernesto’s pocket grabs the keys Takes out
Ernesto’s wallet flips it open revealing

A MEXICAN POLICE BADGE
Flips the wallet shut shoves it into his pocket
JAKE
He’s not where you said I’1l1 come
back and kill you He’1l be there

Ernesto nods eyes hot with anger Javier seethes

JAKE
Don’t go anywhere

EXT TIJUANA STREETS - DAY

Jake drives the jeep into the city proper Crowded filled
with folks getting a head start on the night’s festivities

Checks his blackberry for GPS No service here Fucking ATandT

Jake pulls over at a congested street double-parks Climbs
out of the jeep guitar case in hand

A STORE OWNER steps out of a shop and sputters at him
pointing at the jeep Obviously doesn’t want it parked there

Jake ignores him and when he doesn’t go away flashes the
Mexican police badge That works and Store Owner shuts up

Jake goes to a tourist stand grabs a city map and pays for
it Walks back to the jeep spreads the map out

Finds the point where he is Looks up the name of the club
Other side of town

A TAP on his shoulder along with a question in Spanish Jake
brushes the hand away intent on the map

Another tap insistent Jake looks up holds up the badge
It’s the Store Owner again Asking him something in Spanish

But it’s not directed at Jake Directed at someone standing
just over Jake’s shoulder

Jake turns badge in hand and looks up into the eyes of

A MEXICAN COP

In uniform A police car nearby The Cop takes the badge from
Jake asks him a question

The Cop Jake’s badge in hand asks him another question
Harder this time

A moment

The Cop looks at the badge then at Jake Reaches fast for
the gun on his belt

Jake pushes the Cop away out into the street and into
traffic The Cop dodges cars nearly getting clipped

Jake jumps into the jeep starts it and backs away
Zigzags in and out of traffic Backwards

The Cop jumps into his car follows Jake down the street
shouting into his radio

Jake hits an intersection SPINS Drives forward down the
street nearly getting sideswiped by another police car

Both follow him now and both are faster than the jeep

They rocket down the city street people dodging out of the
way Right before an intersection Jake sees

A KID ON A BIKE

right in his path not enough time to get out of the way
The Kid screams and shuts his eyes

Jake SLAMS on the brakes cranks the wheel Tires squeal

The jeep slides sideways tips up over onto its side and
slides to a stop It stays on its side

Jake drops down from the driver’s seat lightly on his feet
Grabs the guitar case and map

Runs for it like a madman slinging the case over his back

The Kid opens his eyes as police cars zip past either side of
the upturned jeep sirens wailing

Jake dodges down a narrow alley

A police car screeches to a stop at the entrance COPS jump
out and follow Jake on foot

EXT ALLEY - DAY

Jake ducks in and out of tight connected alleys jumping over
crates and junk left in dark places like these

Cops hard on this tail shouting

Jake sees daylight at an open street only to have a
police car cut him off He ducks into another twisty alley

More daylight ahead Open road

Jake pushes himself harder now pumping his arms
A GARBAGE TRUCK

blocks entrance of the alley

A GARBAGE MAN

in overalls and gloves hot and tired jumps off the back
picks up a can Dumps it into the back

He wipes sweat off his forehead jumps up on the back of the
truck Slaps the side to signal the driver to go

AND THE GARBAGE TRUCK lays rubber tearing the hell out of
there real fast Really fast

Cops pour out of the alley shouting at the truck
The Garbage Man hangs on tight feet flying out in the air

On the street behind him he sees the GARBAGE TRUCK DRIVER
lying on the sidewalk rubbing his jaw

In that briefest of instants while flailing around on the
back the Garbage Man wonders

Who the hell is now driving the Garbage Truck
INT GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY

Jake downshifts putting the accelerator to the floor The
truck is really booking it down the street

He lays on the HORN People duck out of the way

A police car zips up alongside lights flashing Bumps the
front of the truck Mistake

Jake RAMS the police car off the road into a store

More lights in his rear view Too much attention Jake spins
the wheel turns off the narrow road into a wider throughway

More room to move Jake shifts gears goes FASTER The
truck hauls ass zipping in and out of traffic

Looks in the rear view Police lights recede Jake grins

Looks ahead Shit Police cars ahead blocking the road

Five cars parked at an angle with each other only a thin
path between them not wide enough not at all

Jake thinks for a moment Puts the pedal to the metal
Truck’s now at full speed

Right for the blockade Cops point guns waving him off

At the last second with the nose of the truck at the
blockade opening Jake DOWNSHIFTS to second

Gears grind Front wheels LOCK Back end slides knocking
a police car out of the way opening the path

GARBAGE MAN hangs on for dear life on the back

Jake UPSHIFTS gears grab hold straightens out of the
slide and the Garbage Truck just

SHIMMIES right through the blockade cops watch open
mouthed as the truck slides on past them

JAKE grins blows a big sigh of relief now that the
police cars are far enough behind

Looks ahead

A BUNCH OF KIDS in the road at a school crossing Nuns
waving stop signs try to get them out of the way frantic

JAKE downshifts to first yanks up the handbrake

THE GARBAGE TRUCK SPINS in a three hundred and sixty degree
circle ONCE TWICE A THIRD TIME the Garbage Man
flailing on the end trash flying everywhere NEARLY TIPPING
until it

STOPS right side up

The kids all cheer and applaud at the spectacle

The Garbage Man pants still hanging onto his rail on the
back Doesn’t want to let go

With his free hand he crosses himself

Police cars squeal to a stop Cops jump out swarm the truck
Jump up to the cab weapons out and ready

Cab’s empty
Jakes disappeared
EXT ALLEY - DAY

Jake skirts along an alley guitar case on his back Leans
back against the wall when he sees a police car drive by

Watches it go Checks his map
Steps out to the
STREET

Finds an old beat up VOLKSWAGON Pulls out his slim jim
preparing to break in until he notices

A NICE BMW newer and sleeker Jake sidles over preparing to
break into it until he notices

A CHILDS CAR SEAT in the back That stops him
He hears English being spoken around the corner

TWO ASSHOLE AMERICAN FRAT BOYS climb out of a PIMPED OUT VAN
talking shit about hookers and booze in that order

They lock the van up tight Pull out a wad of cash give a
couple bills to an OLD MAN sitting close by

Miming with their hands they signal to the Old Man to keep
an eye on their van for them Old Man takes the money

With that the Frat Boys head up into the whorehouse The Old
Man stares at the dollar bills in his hand Shakes his head

Jake appears Inspects the tricked out van

JAKE
Nice van How much

The Old Man thinks Holds up four fingers Jake counts out
four one hundred dollar bills American hands them over

JAKE
And the hat

The Old Man shrugs hands over a straw cowboy hat but won’t
take any more money Joe puts it on adjusts the brim Nods

Jake opens the van up in a snap with the slim jim Hotwires
it fast engine rumbling

JAKE
Pleasure doing business with you

The Old Man waves to him as he goes
INT STRIP BAR - DAY

Late afternoon in a truly dark and dirty strip club Place is
full of unsavory characters drinking the hard stuff

Sad-eyed strippers work the poles and tourists Loud music

A surprising number of dancers and bar staff are MISSING
FINGERS Multiple fingers

If the patrons notice they don’t remark on it The front
door opens giving a brief glimpse of light and the revelry
outside from people in costumes for All Saints Day

DEDOS The Tattooed Man strolls in like he owns it He
does People deliberately move out of his way

Dedos picks up a drink at the bar without slowing Shoots it
down hands the glass to someone else

He heads right for the men’s room slamming the door shut
AT THE BAR

Jake raises his head which he’d kept low and covered
with his cowboy hat Also makes his way to the men’s room

INT MEN’S ROOM - DAY

A very foul excuse of a shitter Three open stalls with no
doors and clogged toilets and a long smelly old school
urinal trough

Dedos stands at the urinal pissing his back to Jake

Jake checks the place out Empty no one else there Reaches
into his pocket

DEDOS
I hear you’re looking for me

Dedos hasn’t turned around ain’t looking Just knows

JAKE
Heard that from who

Jake gets his answer via a
GUN BARREL pressed against his skull

Javier and Ernesto in the doorway both supremely pissed
Javier holds the gun barrel up tight against Jake’s temple

ERNESTO
You fucked up my friend You
should never have left us alive

Ernesto shuts the door tight Dedos zips up Turns around

DEDOS
Whoever you are you don’t have to
look anymore You have found me
Unfortunate for you

Ernesto takes Jake’s guns away Dedos asks Ernesto a question
in Spanish Ernesto answers

DEDOS
Que Ernesto say you a car thief

JAKE
I was once In another life

DEDOS
You out of lives now

Dedos beckons the group over to the urinal

Javier and Ernesto grin Grab Jake by the collar gun still
pressed against his head and drag him over to the urinal

Kick the back of his knees forcing him to kneel

Ernesto grabs Jake’s right hand places it on the lip of the
urinal trough which is notched and blood-stained

Dedos leans down picks up a wicked machete Twirls it

Dedos places the tip of the blade right between Jake’s
fingers putting the pinkie in great jeopardy

DEDOS
I think I will take all your
fingers one at a time After that
I drive you down to my kennel Feed
you to my dogs

(MORE)
DEDOS (CONTD)
watch you fight them just as they
fight with only your teeth and
feet They are hungry Haven’t
eaten in days Sometimes they tear
their meal apart so fast the man
is still screaming as he’s
swallowed However if you answer
my questions fully and honestly
maybe I’11 slit your throat before
I give you to the dogs and save you
much anguish Now Why are you
looking for me

JAKE
My wife

DEDOS
Your wife

Dedos laughs Ernesto and Javier join in

DEDOS
I know many wives And they are
glad to know me too I’m sorry if
that upsets you

JAKE
You took my wife you son-of-a-
bitch

Dedos leans close Looks hard
DEDOS
I know you You the maricone at the

mall asking for phone number

JAKE
My wife Where is she

Dedos notes the tattoo on Jake’s hand
DEDOS
That lying whore I would ask for
her tongue if she were mine
Dedos lifts the machete putting it under Jake’s chin
DEDOS
She is no one’s wife motherfucker

She is Dark’s woman

JAKE
She’s my wife and I’m her husband

Dedos stares a moment With the machete he taps on Jake’s
wedding ring Chuckles Barks in Spanish

Ernesto rips Jake’s wallet out of his back pocket Opens it
Finds a picture of Connor Gives it to Dedos He examines it

DEDOS
A son Dark will be happy You see
since the woman belonged to Dark
so all whelps she gives birth to
also belong to Dark
Dedos leans close very close to Jake’s face
DEDOS
I will go fetch him too There is
much one can do with a son
Jake flushes his temper red-lining

In a flash Jake snaps his head forward BUTTS DEDOS on the
nose Dedos falls back onto his butt blood spurting

With his free hand Jake grabs the pistol in Javier’s hand
forces it away from his temple pointing up at the ceiling

Ernesto punches Jake Jake lowers his head and takes it on
the top of his skull the hard part

Ernesto curses in pain holding his bruised knuckles

Javier chokes Jake with his other hand gun still pointed up
Jake braces against the trough pushes to his feet

Dedos gets to his knees Jake kicks Dedos on the nose same
spot Knocks him right back on his ass

Javiers pistol pointed at the ceiling goes off
Ernesto gets his pistol out Aims it at Jake Gets too close

Jake grabs that weapon with his free hand pulls it right
into Javiers side Jake squeezes Ernesto’s gun fires

SHOOTS JAVIER in the side Blood spatters Javier releases
Jake holding his gut in pain

ERNESTO
Javier no

Jake elbows Ernesto on the chin knocks him flat on his back

A HOWL OF RAGE from Dedos as he leaps to his feet whirling
his machete Dedos rushes forward hacking down at Jake

Jake slips to the side of the cut leaving

Javier in the path of the descending blade Javier has just
enough time to scream before being cleaved

Blood spatters the walls
Ernesto on his ass feebly tries to aim his pistol Jake
kicks it out of his hand It skitters across the floor into

one of the stalls

Dedos swings his blade at Jake Jake ducks and rolls away
The blade slices Ernesto on both forearms He wails

Dedos stalks Jake stabbing cutting and cursing

Jake slips into a toilet stall searching for the gun Can’t
find it Ducks down The machete stabs into the stall wall

Jake steps back yanks off the toilet seat Turns to face
Dedos Dedos swings but clangs against the side of the
stall not enough room to really slice and dice He stabs

Jake blocks it with the toilet seat Snaps it right back
Catches the tattooed prick in the nose again

Dedos screams in fury stabs viciously

Jake catches the blade in the “0” ring of the toilet seat
Twists and leverages the machete down and out of his hand

Yanks Dedos forward Jake grabs Dedos by the neck pushes his
head into the dirty water of the toilet Dedos flails

JAKE
Where is she

Jake yanks Dedos’s head up

JAKE
Tell me

Jake dunks Dedos back into the foul water Dedos bellows
Puts both hands on the toilet and pushes back up

Dedos elbows Jake in the gut Jake knees him Dedos falls to
his back on the floor Jake raining down blows

Dedos spots Ernesto’s pistol on the floor two stalls away
Shoves Jake off of him slides under the stall wall crawling
for the pistol on his belly

Jake sees what Dedos is after Grabs his leg Dedos kicks him
off Jake rolls away picks the machete up

Dedos grabs the pistol Lurches to his feet

Jake steps out of his stall at the same time Dedos exits his
Dedos raises the pistol

Jake swings the machete

DEDOS’S HAND AND PISTOL FALL TO THE FLOOR

Dedos collapses against the back wall clutching his wrist at
the stump Howling

JAKE
Where is my wife

Dedos going into shock looks up at Jake

DEDOS
The whore deserves to burn

That tips Jake over the edge He HACKS at Dedos until he’s
nothing but a stain Dead Jake steps back breathing hard

Ernesto on the floor tries hard to pick up Javiers fallen
pistol Ernesto’s fingers don’t work so well now due to cut
tendons keeps dropping the gun He sees Jake backs away

ERNESTO
No Jacob please no

Jake places the machete blade up tight against Ernesto’s
throat Picks up the pistol

JAKE

ERNESTO

seen you in years and-

JAKE

In honor of our past friendship

JAKE

Jake kneels down close to him beckoning Ernesto whispers
hurriedly into his ear When done Jake leans back

ERNESTO
It’s the truth hand to God

Jake nods Stands Thinks a moment

JAKE
You also told me when you first
walked in here that I should have

ERNESTO
Jacob We were at one point

Jake fires a bullet into Ernesto’s skull killing him

JAKE
It’s who I am now

Jake walks quietly to the door Opens it surprising

TWO STRIPPERS

standing close to the door listening Both women while not
old have a lot of mileage on their face and bodies

Jake doesn’t move unsure of what to do

The older of the two URSULA peeks past Jake Sees whats
left of Dedos Speaks Spanish to the younger one ALIZ

Aliz nods looks back over her shoulder Women dance and
music pounds loud and harsh No one else heard anything

They both step inside shut the door Aliz stands guard at
the door Ursula walks past Jake kneels to stare at Dedos

She glances back at Jake

JAKE
He took my wife

After a moment Ursula holds up her hand

URSULA
My fingers He took

She’s missing three She searches around Finds the detached
hand of Dedos Picks it up puts it into her purse Smiles

Stands barks Spanish at Aliz Aliz nods slips out

Ursula goes to the door holding it shut Jake goes to speak
she shushes him They wait A knock She cracks it open
Aliz Ursula gestures for Jake to follow

INT STRIP BAR - CONTINUOUS

Jake slides out of the men’s room after Ursula Aliz hangs a
sign on the bathroom door

EXT TIJUANA STREETS - NIGHT

Jake drives slowly through crowded streets The sun is
setting and festivities have officially begun

People dance and parade in costumes honoring the dead the
spirits of those who have passed onward before them

Lots of death masks Lots of music and fire and drink

Jake hits an intersection too packed with people to drive
through and parks the van

They climb out Jake slinging the guitar case over his back
He checks his watch Almost six Ursula points to a

WALLED COMPOUND

at the far end of the street With guarded gates and a
courtyard within A band and tables of food and drink

Jake looks around at the crowd the food and game stands
People celebrating Sees what he’s looking for Pushes
through the crowd Ursula and Aliz follow him to a

SMALL SHOP

Inside an OLD MAN paints a devil’s mask on the face of a
young BOY adding last touches to a fantastic makeup job

The Boy jumps up when done and his DAD pays the Old Man The
Boy bounces out his father close behind to join the parade

Jake steps inside sits in the chair

The Old Man greets him in Spanish Jake takes out his
blackberry Pulls up the picture of Dedos’s face

Points at Dedos’s tattoo Points to his own cheek

The Old Man stares at the pic for a long time Glances at the
women Sighs Shakes his head Jake takes out a wad of cash

Old Man keeps shaking his head Says something in Spanish
Ursula answers They debate Jake keeps peeling off bills

Finally the Old Man stops him Takes the cash

Gets his ink and brushes together moves close Ursula
whispers to Aliz who steps outside shuts the door

EXT TIJUANA STREETS - NIGHT
Later with Ursula and Aliz on each arm Jake staggers toward
the compound clad in the black duster Dedos’s hat pulled

down low Sunglasses Guitar case on his back

In one hand a bottle of tequila In the other Dedos’s
machete On his cheek a remarkable reproduction of the TAT

In the shadows he looks like Dedos himself

They follow scores of other festival people who flock through
the entrance of the Walled Compound and on into

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Lots of people celebrating music and drink plentiful Men
lurch by and shout joyfully at Jake who keeps his head down

They pull back under a terrace of a building Look around

In the center of the courtyard a big pit with a stake in the
center built for a fire

An entrance to the buildings where an obviously more VIP
version of the party is in action

GUARDS stand at the entrance with weapons checking people
before they enter the building proper and VIP areas

Jake weaves toward the entrance leaning on the women Head
down Not looking up They walk right by the GUARDS

A YOUNG GUARD notices challenges them They keep walking
Young Guard follows them barking Spanish Ursula and Aliz
now respond chattering back at him

Young Guard grabs Ursula by the arm In a flash

The machete blade is out against Young Guard’s throat Jake
holds it there tight but still hasn’t looked up

A FAT GUARD on the other side shouts at Young Guard who
replies holding up his hands Jake looks over to Fat Guard

Fat Guard raises his hand which is missing two fingers and
waves Jake and the women on through

They continue on to stairs leading up to a
SECOND FLOOR TERRACE

that wraps around the connected buildings and oversees the
entire courtyard Ursula and Aliz conspire Aliz disappears

URSULA
She find where

Jake nods A loud shrieking horn goes off the kind of
steam whistle that used to be on old trains People perk up

The horn wails again A HUGE STRETCH HUMMER LIMO pulls into
the courtyard People cheer and shout

A MAN stands in the open ceiling window in the limo waving
his arms and urging the crowd Ursula points

URSULA
Dark

Jake leans forward on the rail for a better look The Hummer
Stretch Limo pulls to a stop

DARK climbs out a powerful-looking man Wavy black hair
and a beard Smiles like the world-beater he’s sure he is

Two HUGE BODYGUARDS climb out with him black suits
sunglasses obviously packing heavy heat

Dark addresses the crowd in Spanish They cheer
Aliz appears beckons them from at a corner at the other end
of the terrace Ursula leads Jake by the hand Some drunken

men shout greetings at Jake but he ignores them

BENITO a tubby merc finds this curious behavior from his
friend Dedos Follows them

Jake and Ursula join Aliz who confers fast with her friend

URSULA
Downstairs

The three walk down a set of stairs Benito follows Shouts
out at them Ursula replies and they don’t stop

Benito hurries down catches them at the bend in the stairs

Aliz tries to flirt but Benito brushes her off Directs a
question at Jake who ignores him pretending to be drunk

Ursula tells Benito as much in Spanish but Benito’s
attention is fixated on Jake’s face

Jake’S SWEATING And the makeup is RUNNING as a result

Benito’s eyes widen Reaches for the pistol in his belt Jake
swings the machete Benito catches his wrist

A battle over the blade

The women shrink back Benito shoves him against the wall
The guitar case strap breaks slides off of Jake’s back

Jake swings the bottle of tequila Breaks it open on Benito’s
head Dazes but doesn’t take him out

With his other hand Benito pulls out a pistol aims it

Jake drops the machete grabs the pistol and traps the slide
making it impossible for Benito to chamber a round

Benito punches him Jake stabs him in the throat with the
broken neck of the tequila bottle Leaves it as blood spurts

Benito gurgles falls Aliz guides the dying man into a
nearby wooden chair Pulls his hat down low on him

Ursula joins them Jake picks up his guitar case and they
walk quickly away down a hallway to

JUST OFF THE COURTYARD

The crowd sways and dances to the music Lots of noise Jake
and the women stop outside a low window that looks into a
first floor room

Aliz points at the window

INSIDE A BANQUET ROOM

Dark sits at the head of a table hosting festivities with a
few other FATCATS and women who are obviously party favors

Dark’s two bodyguards help themselves to the buffet
Everyone’s calm everyone’s relaxed

And at the table to the right of Dark

KARA sits head down

Dressed in an evening gown Defeated and hollow Her left
hand is bandaged missing the pinky finger

Jake drops back out of sight squats under the window
Looks at Ursula and Aliz

JAKE
Thank you for your help

He lays down the guitar case Opens it
JAKE
Go Get on out of here okay

You’ve done enough

URSULA

INT BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

Dark chats amicably with guests Cuban cigar in his teeth
Leans over tweaks Kara’s cheek with his fingers

Pulls out an expensive lighter lights the Cuban Dark’s
Fatcat friends guffaw as they also light cigars

JAKE
Excuse me

Everyone looks up Jake stands in the doorway in the black
duster cowboy hat smeared dark makeup and holding an M16

JAKE
I’m here for my wife

Jake points the M16 right at Dark Everyone freezes

Dark gestures to his bodyguards who have their hands in
their jackets Speaks Spanish They relax

DARK
And you are

Kara looks up eyes full of despair

JAKE
Jake Collier You Enrique Reyna

The room shifts uncomfortable Dark’s eyes glitter

DARK
My name is Dark The last man who
called me Enrique Reyna to my face
I force-fed him his own genitals

JAKE
A sad story but he probably wasn’t
pointing an automatic weapon in
your direction at the time was he

DARK
(after a moment)
He wasn’t It most certainly does
make a profound difference

Darks breaks into large grin and laughs The room joins

DARK
That hat I know the man it belongs
to he is an associate of mine

JAKE
Was He’s hamburger now

Takes a minute for Dark to get that and when he does he
slaps his knee and laughs hard Explains to the others

Kara raises her eyes at the story dark emotions stirring

DARK
Oh I like you I do You may not
realize it but you’ve done me a
great favor Please come join us

JAKE
I’m not planning to stay and I’m
not here to do you any favors

DARK
Perhaps but you did regardless
That man you kill Dedos the owner
of the hat he was fast becoming a
problem for me Very brutal and
ambitious Dedos was It would have
been necessary and difficult to
remove him You took care of that
for me so I am in your debt
Please come in and let’s discuss
your grievance in a civilized
Manner You may even keep your
weapon as a sign of our trust

Jake hesitates Steps further inside
DARK
Please sit If I understand
correctly you contend that we have
your wife here with us

Jake glances around People have relaxed and the
have resumed their assault on the buffet

JAKE
That’s my wife

Jake sits down in a chair opposite of Dark

DARK
This woman here

Dark suspicious nods at Kara

JAKE
Yes

KARA
No It’s not true he’s lying He’s
crazy mal de la cabeza

DARK
Yet here he is

Kara chatters in Spanish Dark holds up a finger

DARK
English please so our friend here
can follow what is obviously a
matter of great importance to him

KARA

He’s sick a crazy white man who
lost his wife years ago and snapped
in his head He’s obsessed been
stalking me for years I had to
quit a job because he wouldn’t
leave me alone

JAKE

me with someone else and you need
help I’m not who think I am You
should just go Leave this place

bodyguards

JAKE
What are you doing we’re married-

KARA
No you and I are not We are

She puts her hand on DARK’S ARM It hits Jake hard Dark
suspicious sees that this news tears Jake up

DARK
This woman you claim to have
married is in fact my wife We
were unfortunately separated for a
time but have now reconciled

KARA
You need to leave this place Now

Kara and Jake’s eyes meet She pleads silently

JAKE
(after a moment)
I know what you’re doing I know
why You don’t have to make this
sacrifice I won’t leave you
You’re the mother of my son-

DARK
Son

KARA
No He’s lying believe me-

DARK
You have a son Can you prove it

With one hand Jake pulls out his wallet Flips to a picture
Dark takes it Holds it up next to Kara who drops her eyes

Compares the picture to her Obvious resemblance

DARK
I gave you everything I would have
given even more I loved you And
this is how you betray me

Dark tosses the wallet back to Jake Fumes Snarls a massive
string of Spanish curses Pounds the table The room stills

DARK
Dedos was right you are a lying
whore I should have let him deal
with your impertinence in his way

Dark leans forward arms on the table to Jake

DARK
As a measure of my gratitude for
your help with Dedos here is my
proposal I will allow you to walk
out of here alive and keep your
son That is no small concession on
my part I assure you

JAKE
And my wife

DARK
Her destiny lies with me Obviously
her sins must be atoned for

JAKE
No Hell no

KARA
Jake please go-

Dark snarls at Kara in Spanish Turns smiles at Jake

DARK
My apologies for the interruption
So you refuse my offer

JAKE
She’s my wife I won’t leave her

DARK
Your wife You do not even know her
real name do you not If you do
please tell me what it is

Jake says nothing Dark leans back holds his hands out

DARK
She lied to you About everything
She’s a thief a liar and a whore
She ran away from her obligation to
me just as she did with you After
what she’s done still you risk
everything for her Now that you
know who she really is

A moment Jake takes a deep breath Lets it out
JAKE

Yes I know who she is inside
where it counts Always have

DARK
I know her better than you I took
her off the streets gave her
money education and my name I
gave her a life And when I told
her it was time to start a family
she ran away Ran away From me
Her husband For that alone she
should burn In spite of that when
she was found I welcomed her back
with an open heart With hope and
love And now I find she bore the
child of another No It is too
much A man of honor like myself
cannot let such an insult pass

JAKE
You’re pond-scum I’m sure you’1ll
get over it

DARK
(after a moment)
That is twice you’ve insulted me
Do you really wish to throw away
your life for this whore

JAKE
This M16 semi-automatic fires at a
velocity of three thousand feet per
second causing massive wounding
and hydrostatic shock on flesh
Effective up to six hundred yards

Jake stands slowly Dark also stands

JAKE
I’m only six feet away Call my
wife a whore again and I’1l turn
your skull into a fucking canal

DARK
You think me a fool that I’d allow
you to walk in here invite you to
sit without a weapon trained on
your head at all times

Jake hears a click behind him in the doorway a GUARD
aims a pistol at the back of his head

DARK
I don’t think so

In the instant Jake is distracted Dark snakes out a hand
grabs Kara by the wrist Pulls her quick in front of him

DARK
Put the weapon down

KARA
Jake don’t Shoot me instead

Dark hides behind her Jake doesn’t have a clear shot at him
The bodyguards also pull their pistols

DARK
Put It Down

Outside a show of FIREWORKS begins loud People cheer
KARA
Kill me Jake please Just shoot
me and get out of here

Jake hesitates lowers the rifle a fraction Dark smiles

KARA
Just kill me

URSULA (0S)
No

URSULA appears behind the guard at the door machete in
hand Hacks the guard in the neck dropping him

HELL UNLEASHES in a rain of bullets The hacked guard on the
floor shoots Ursula She screams

Jake FIRES at the Bodyguards killing both men

Swings the M16 and takes out a couple of Fatcats pulling
pistols Their arm-candy dates scream and drop to the floor

More Guards run in firing wildly before they’re dropped with
military precision by Jake with his rifle

He runs out of ammo ejects the clip

A Fatcat rises up pulling a gun Jake slams him in the face
with the butt of the M16

The Fatcat goes down hard on his well-fed ass
Jake sees

DARK holding Kara by her hair Dark pulls out a pistol

Jake drops the M16 Pulls out a Beretta
Both men raise their pistols simultaneously and FIRE
Jake takes a bullet in his left shoulder goes down

Dark gets dinged on the head knocked back Releases Kara
before he hits the ground hard

Kara goes to her hands and knees crawling away from him

Two more GUARDS RUSH IN Jake on his back swivels and
fires Hits them in the shins They fall to the floor

Jake empties the clip into their heads killing them Rolls
to his feet his left arm useless

Kara stands the same time as Jake Quick moment of hesitation
between them

JAKE
Hey beautiful

Kara rushes to him hugging hard Jake looks down at

Ursula on the floor A bullet hole in her chest She’s going
fast Aliz next to her crying Jake kneels close

JAKE
Why

URSULA
No woman Belongs This place

Ursula looks at Aliz then back to Jake Jake gets it Nods

Ursula touches Aliz’s face talking quiet breathing hard and
slow Ursula smiles Stops breathing Aliz cries

A guttural CURSE in Spanish from behind the banquet table
Dark stands hand to the side of his head He’s lost an ear
Jake raises his Beretta pulls the trigger Empty

Dark brings his gun up Jake throws his at Dark who ducks

Jake runs launches himself over the table at Dark Crashes
into him Knocks the pistol from his hands

Dark grabs Jake by the throat pushing him back over the
table They roll over the top to the floor

Jake lands hard on his wounded arm He cries out
Dark picks him up shaking him like a dog Jake knees him

Dark pushes hard and the momentum carries the two men
through the door out of the room and into

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

the middle of the celebrating crowd punching and
kneeing People move out of the way fast Dark hammers Jake

Throws Jake hard into the Stretch Limo Hummer Jake bounces
off the side goes to the ground writhing in pain

The band quits playing The crowd watches silent

Dark boasts his bad-assery in Spanish to the crowd Kicks
Jake a couple times for good measure Plays to the crowd

Rips open his shirt revealing a large gang tattoo

He picks Jake up by his hair Shakes him Takes the duster
down trapping Jake’s arms

Rips the front of Jake’s shirt open revealing
The words “ASNO TERCO” tattooed on his chest Dark laughs

DARK
An appropriate epitaph

Grabs Jake by the throat Kara behind Dark

BREAKS a BOTTLE of liquor over his head Liquid flies
everywhere covers everything

Dark drops Jake staggers a few steps Backhands Kara who
goes down Jake shrugs off the duster runs at Dark

They ram into a table grappling furiously Dark sticks his
thumb into the hole in Jake’s shoulder Jake cries out

DARK
I will make you watch her burn
before I cut you into pieces

Jake grits his teeth takes the pain Pulls out his right
hand which holds

JAKE
That smells like homemade
moonshine which means-—-

DARK’S LIGHTER stolen from his jacket
JAKE
Nobody’s gonna be able to call you
Dark for much longer
Jake flicks the lighter to a big flame Thrusts it at Dark
His alcohol-drenched clothing LIGHTS UP immediately

Dark BURNS fast and furious He screams stumbles away No
one from the crowd moves to help him

After a few steps Dark drops to his knees burning even
brighter Falls The fire burns hot The crowd watches him

The screams fade away as Dark dies before them

Kara helps Jake up Aliz joins them They all watch After a
moment Aliz steps forward

She SPITS on what’s left of the corpse

One by one others from the crowd step forward and do the
same Even those guards who are left alive

They all spit on him one by one Dark had few if any
friends still alive in this place

Some WOMEN working there beckon Aliz They help Aliz lead
Kara and Jake out of the compound

The band starts playing again Festivities continue on
INT MEXICAN DOCTOR’S CLINIC - NIGHT

Jake sits on an examination table while a DOCTOR pokes and
prods him fixing the hole in Jake’s shoulder Jake winces

Kara close by watches the process with worried eyes as a
NURSE checks Kara’s bandaged hand

Aliz sits close by waiting

No words between the husband and wife
Only silence

INT AIRPLANE (FLYING) - DAY

Aliz sits up close to the pilot more than a little nervous
about this tiny puddle-jumper of an airplane

Jake and Kara sit together not far but not close
A tight almost visible silence between them
INT JAKE’S TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

Jake left arm in a sling pulls into a long dirt drive Kara
sits next to him in the middle Aliz on the far side

Though they sit close an obvious distance between them

The taut quietness between the two blankets everything
Kara notices the tattooed note “I LOVE YOU” on Jake’s hand
Realizes he put it there permanently It hits her inside
Kara reaches out touches it Smiles at him First one
Jake smiles back

Ice breaks

Kara sees a bit of the tattoo on Jake’s chest that reads
“ASNO TERCO” poking out from his shirt She hides a giggle

JAKE
What

KARA
I can’t believe you tattooed that

JAKE
Still don’t know what it means
What does it say in English
Kara looks to Aliz Both giggle

ALIZ
Stubborn ass

JAKE
Ah well That fits

KARA
I told you to wash it off

JAKE
I wanted to keep everything of
yours that I could Everything

Kara digests that Quiet for a moment Takes a breath

KARA
I met him when I was very young
when I had nothing He
overwhelmed me bought me things
I had no idea who he really
was what he was I couldn’t
bring children into that world

She takes a second to collect herself

KARA
So I ran Met you Built a life
But I had to go back when they
found me He would have done
things to you and to our-

JAKE
I know

KARA
I couldn’t bear it And when I said
those terrible things to you I
didn’t mean them I was trying to-

JAKE
Sand

KARA
What

JAKE

Colored pebbles of sand That’s all
the past is Sand Makes a picture
and when we’re done with that
picture whatever it is we take
a deep breath blow and let it all
go with the wind Right

Kara nods her eyes full Puts her hand on his
JAKE
Get something for me out of my
shirt pocket

She reaches into his pocket Pulls out her wedding ring

JAKE
I kept that for you

She wipes her eyes slides the ring on her finger Kisses his
cheek Jake honks the horn as the truck pulls up to

EXT HOUSE IN THE WOODS - DAY
Brody hollers from the garage ambles over Luiz close by

CONNOR on the porch steps with his puppy stands when he
sees the truck Carefully sets his dog down

Connor looks close to see who’s in the truck
Starts to run Fast

CONNOR
Mommy Mommy Mommy and Daddy

Runs for the truck as fast as his legs will take him
Kara climbs out arms outstretched

Connor leaps into them

Hugging and kissing and shouting

Jake joins Kara and Connor in a big huge hug

Picture of a happy family united

FADE OUT
