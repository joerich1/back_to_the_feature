dreamlike disturbing

A HAND is trying to dial three simple numbers Trembling
fingers miss try againwe hear boop-boop-boop

911 OPERATOR
(filtered)
911 operator what is your emergency

The phone rises gripped tightly Knuckles white Were TIGHT
its dark we see no face -- just slack trembling lips

Whoever it is he cant talk All we hear is breathing all
we sense is grief and panic and deep shock

WHITE - 9-7-8 2
EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

POLICE VEHICLES converge in SLOW-MOTION dreamlike Doors fly
open COPS jump out weapons drawn as WE MOVE with them to
Front door RAMP TO NORMAL CAMERA SPEED as it opens revealing

BENSON CLYDE phone still gripped He barely registers the
weapons aimed at his face CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HIM as

CLYDE
She cantclose her eyes

Hes pulled from frame CAMERA KEEPS MOVING following COPS
into the house

Dark as hell inside And tense Arms training weapons Moving
up a tight hallway emerging into

THE LIVING ROOM

where the flashlight beams find blood-spatter patterns
Furniture shattered and overturned A kids sneaker

The flashlights play across TWO BODIES in the wreckage -- a
womans pale hand a childs motionless leg

CAMERA DRIFTS AROUND to the cops faces as
CoP 1

(unsnaps shoulder radio)
Dispatch we have multiple 10-55s
need full response 11-41

EXT HOUSE (SLO-MO) - NIGHT

Chaotic now vehicles and lights The eye of the storm is

Clyde on the lawn hugging his knees

fetal with horror and

grief Hes screaming at the sky but no sound is coming out

EMS TECHS enter shot steal the frame

INT HOUSE (SLO-MO) - NIGHT

race toward the door

TRACKING SHOT at floor level photos being taken FLASHES
bathe the foreground wreckage FORENSIC TECHS step gingerly
Uniformed cops hang grimly back hugging the walls

CAMERA BRINGS US TO CLOSEUP A PROFILE IN DEEP SHADOW in the
foreground face tilted obliquely in the wreckage

A CAMERA FLASH reveals the face with shocking glare and the
IMAGE FREEZES A TEN YEAR-OLD GIRL eyes open staring at us

CLYDE (VO)

(prelap)

Her eyes Thats how they were

Open like that You see

WHITE - 9-7-8

INT CITY HALL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Clyde is seated speaking slowly and precisely ANGLE WIDENS
revealing the room light filtering through blinds as

CLYDE

When I found my wife and child dead
my little girls eyes were open

(pause)

The last thing she saw of this earth
were the faces of the men who took
her life Can you understand that

NICK (0OS

Yes Yes I can

CLYDE
Can you Really

)
(looks to somebody else)
You

CANTRELL (0S)
Mr Clyde I dont see this helping

CLYDE
No You married Children

Senior Attorney for the State He wears thick glasses and is
suffering the early stages of macular degeneration

CANTRELL

in life

Clyde spreads the crime scene photos further on the table
ANGLE COMES AROUND to reveal the third man in the room

NICK PRICE

The DA under Cantrell -- focused exceptional at what he
does the man youd want on your side

CLYDE
You Mr Price Married Kids

Nick doesnt answer stays focused on the task

NICK
Ive seen the crime scene photos
Mr Clyde Many times Theyre
horrifying But they dont alter
the facts of the case

BLUE - 9-19-08 4

CLYDE
Facts Those men are guilty Both
of them You know they are

NICK
This isnt about what we know Its
about what we can prove in court

CANTRELL
Things have gone against us Tainted
crime scene evidence thrown out

CLYDE
Maybe you just havent tried hard

enough

NICK
Look Weve had only one real break
in this case The fact that one
asshole has decided to testify
against the other asshole

CLYDE
In return for immunity So he gets
away with it

CANTRELL
The other man doesnt Hell go
down for the crime That has to
count for something

CLYDE
Yes It counts for half
(pause quietly)
Dont reward one of the men who
murdered my family Please

NICK
Mr Clyde I cant claim to know
what its like to be in your
position Losing your wife and child
But please try to grasp how limited
our options are This is how the
justice system works

Clyde sits for a long moment numb absorbing this
CLYDE
Ah I see my mistake I came for

justice Instead I got a system

8 INT CITY HALL - HALLWAY - DAY

SARAH LOWELL fresh out of law school is waiting anxiously
for the meeting to end arms full of file folders

BLUE - 9-19-08 4A

With her is BILL REYNOLDS the defense attorney in this case
glancing impatiently at his watch
Clyde exits the room fast not watching where hes going
accidentally plowing into Sarah as he passes

Sorry My fault

SARAH

BLUE - 9-19-08

NICK
You were top of your class at Yale

CANTRELL
Young lady Someday you might have
our jobs You know the issues of

the case before the court Speak

SARAH
Okay Um You can take both men to
trial spend a year and millions of
taxpayer dollars and probably lose
Or you can cut a deal and at least
put one of the men who did the crime
on death row Its a no-brainer

You make the deal

REYNOLDS
(smug to the men)

Duh
They trade a look Cantrell glances to Sarah

CANTRELL
When the day comes that you argue a
real case in court you might refrain
from summing up with duh

SARAH

Ill avoid that

NICK
Clarence Darby This document
guarantees that you will provide
testimony against Rupert Ames in
the matter of which you were both
accused In return you will be
(MORE)

BLUE - 9-19-08 7

NICK (CONTD)
shielded from further prosecution
for those capital crimes But you
will plead guilty to the lesser
charge of breaking and entering

REYNOLDS
Youll do a maximum of five years

With good behavior you could be
out in three

JUDGE BURCH
That also depends on your testimony
and the level of your cooperation

DARBY
Your Honor need not worry on my
account I assure the court that I
am aware of the opportunity Ive
been given And I am deeply grateful
to all concerned

Nick gives Cantrell a glance both stoically enduring this
proceeding Darby pulls the document closer

DARBY
If I may It has come to my attention
that Rupert Ames has been spreading

lies about me to the tabloid press
About certain alleged activities of

which I have no knowledge Sexual
and otherwise Libel and
slanderyes

NICK
(dryly)
You can always sue him

CANTRELL

Cantrell starts down Nicks at his side hovering and ready
to grab him jumping at every little lurch Cantrell makes

INT VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT

Nick and his colleagues are among SEVERAL DOZEN WITNESSES
seated in chairs They watch as WARDEN IGER faces Rupert

WARDEN IGER
Rupert Ames Do you have anything
to say

Rupert doesnt have much of an IQ and hes scared shitless
but he does his best

RUPERT
Im here Clarence Darby aint And
that aint right Cause that man
is evil aint no other way to say
it All them things he done and
him turn witness against me for it

He pauses trying to untangle his thoughts

RUPERT

I did wrong too I guess Ill pay

jump and how high and I just went
along Now hes killin me and he
got you people to do it And thats
a shame A goddamn shame And

(pause)
and I guess thats all

Nick trades a look with Sarah Cantrell is stoic

Warden Iger nods to TWO GUARDS manning the LETHAL INJECTION
MACHINE on which EIGHT OVERSIZED GLASS CYLINDERS in a vertical
row are the main feature filled with various clear liquids

There are two switches -- one a dummy the other live (no way
to know which is which) The guards power up the machine
Lights activate on the board Each man grabs a switch waits

Nick watches the wall clock It hits 7 oclock The warden
nods and the guards flick their switches quickly leaving the
room The warden follows them out closes the door

We hear the pumps quietly activate Rupert is taking shallow
breaths terrifiedthen lays back to wait

PLUNGER ONE slowly descends emptying its contents into the
V lines

Rupert sags as the fast-acting barbiturate spreads through
his veinshis breathing slowshis head drops back he
loses consciousness

PLUNGER TWO depresses sending the second vial of liquid into
the IV lines with a quiet whir of pumps
BLUE - 9-19-08 16

PLUNGER THREE activatesthen PLUNGER FOURthe row of
cylinders emptying in sequence

Rupert lies unconscious just drifting away
He suddenly comes to He draws in a long shaky breath It
catches in his throat His eyes go wide His entire body starts

to clench against some increasing pain

Nick is surprised uncertain Betsy starts GROWLING SOFTLY at
Cantrells side Her head comes up hackles rising

Nick glances to the dogthen to Iger sees the stunned look
on the wardens face Something is definitely wrong

The pumps keep whirring the plungers keep descending

Rupert he throws his head back mouth wide

RUPERT
AhahAH
The witnesses go tense confused -- what the hell
RUPERT

Ah--ah--Jesus dont that HURT

Rupert looks down at his arms his expression turning to sheer
horror because The veins are turning angry red then
blackening as the liquids course through them

RUPERT
OH FUCK OH FUCK THAT HUUUURTS

Those are last coherent words he speaks From then on hes
just shrieking and bouncing against his straps because

His veins are starting to smoke Noxious and foul The flesh
starts giving away blood eating though skin like acid

Shock sweeps the onlookers

SARAH
Oh Jesus

CANTRELL
Whats going on Nick
People are on their feet Horror and incomprehension

CANTRELL
Nick goddamn it what

NICK
I dont know

Rupert is fast becoming a horror

BLUE - 9-19-08 17

Its going down his arms and legs up his neck infusing his
ears -- a nauseating discoloration courses through his body
using his veins as a road map going from red to yellow to

black like bruises birthing spontaneously before our eyes

People in the room scream turning away Nick pushes his way
to the viewing glass shouting at the techs

NICK
WHAT THE FUCKS GOING ON DO
SOMETHING
The techs dash into the chamber -- but are instantly gagging

and choking on the toxic fumes billowing from Rupert They

retreat coughing pulling the door shut again

Ruperts screams spew forth toxic fumesbreath blows smoke
from his nostrilseyes liquefyhes arching against his

restraints so hard that bones begin snapping blood spewing

and smoking through his skin

All Nick can do is stand at the glass in horror as whatever
is happening runs its course and the victim collapses ina
cloudy toxic haze

SARAH

The bad part I was just on with

the Governors office He commuted
Rupert Ames sentence They were
trying to call us to stop the
execution They couldnt get through

Nick and Cantrell are stunned as this sinks in

possibility What else you got

But you say its actually me on the

discs as well as CDs

Reactions all around the room Iger leans forward

every inmate on the cellblock

agreement in his silence Clyde turns back to Iger

profile based on chess A tournament-
level player like you can think
five to eight steps ahead of an
average player did you know that
Me I think about ten steps ahead
so Id take you in a game

NICK
What about Clyde

SPOOK
Off the charts If youre eight
steps ahead hes twenty Or fifty
Hes already got the game won on
the first move you dont even know
youre playing yet

that was random Bullshit That was
a pawn taken off the board If I
were you Id be trying to figure
out what the move was

I have been Any thoughts

Top of my head Was the cellmate
ever connected with this case Or
with Clyde Was anybody else in
that facility Guards Cons The

matter how remote Because if Clyde
says he has things in play he does

Youre an average chess player
arent you

Thank you Fathers Day

Theres this tie -- we call it the
Albert after Albert DeSalvo They
tiptoe in one night thread a piano
wire with a ratchet gizmo into one
of your ties Sounds crazy but
trust me it works You put your tie
on and all day long it slowly
tightens You dont even notice
its cutting off the blood-flow to
your brain Then you drop dead
Brain-dead or plain dead doesnt
much matter at that point

The men separate in different directions Dunnigan catches a
glimpse of Sarah almost at her car -- she loses a page from

Dunnigan runs up to Nick shouting something We cant tell
what because Nick cant hear Dunnigan sees Nick is alive

turns and keeps going running to help the others

Nick looks over sees bodies being pulled clear by responders
men running in beating at flames

Nick dazed looks through the drifting smoke and sees Sarah
trying to sit up Theres something wrong with her leg

Nick pulls himself to his knees staggers to his feet as sound
filters back in screams shouts the roar of flames

He stumbles through the smoke to Sarah Shes on the ground
in shock sobbing and flailing crying out Nick sees the
jagged piece of metal that slammed deep into her calf nearly
severing it He drops to his knees tries to calm her

NICK
Youre gonna be all right

He pulls the metal from her leg -- mistake Blood sprays He
clamps down hard with both hands blood going everywhere

CLYDE

Well played

BOOOOM The DETONATION is staggering

Clyde and the cell hes in

SOLITARY WING

instantly vaporizing

BLOWING the bars right out of the stone on a WALL OF FLAME

that overwhelms the lens

FAST CUTS CORRIDORS AND STAIRCASES

FLAME HURTLING with express-train force

BLUE - 9-19-08

EXT PRISON COURTYARD - NIGHT

and BLASTING TONS OF BRICK AND MORTAR skyward

Nick enters the shot as WE
from the building going to

CAMERA PANS HIM AROUND now following him
Iger is staring agog

Davies standing with Iger

Jesus

DOLLY BACK WITH HIM walking away

dust and rubble BG

IGER

Thank God that wing was empty

A car arriving behind them

Dunnigan getting out

IGER

How do I explain this to the city

DUNNIGAN

as he approaches

approaching

I think the Mayor will have your
back

Nick approaches comes abreast of them

Looks are traded with Dunnigan and Davies Relief Fellowship
A touch of sadness Words arent needed here

Nick keeps walking pulls his cell phone starts dialing
Dunnigan smiles He knows exactly where Nicks going

INT TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - DAY

LONG LENS Nick sittingwaiting

An ARRIVING TRAIN moves massively into the shot pulling into
the station

Nick rises A SQUEAL OF BRAKES steel on steel

Nick engulfed in a crowd of arriving passengers people getting
off swirling and jostling all around him wiping frame

only two faces he wants to see
and there they are

He sweeps his family into his arms The final moments of this
movie are all about faces and joy

and CREDITS BEGIN as we

FADE OUT
