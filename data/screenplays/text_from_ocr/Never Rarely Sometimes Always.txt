INT HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 1

A group of excited teenagers wait in the wings of a dark
empty high school stage They are dressed in home-made
costumes from the 1950s The girls in chiffon scarves
poodle skirts and saddle shoes The boys in letterman
jackets

As the lights come up they get into position center stage
The audience cheers A piano plays an upbeat song from the
period and the students perform a sock hop dance They dance
in couples the girls are far more coordinated and committed
than the boys

CUT TO

An ELVIS IMPERSONATOR 14 stands in front of a microphone
crooning a young Elvis song His pelvis gyrates

ELVIS IMPERSONATOR
A rhythm with a beat
Bring me to the door
I want a rhythm with a rock
Lead me to the floor
I want a rhythm with a roll
Goes down to my feet
I wanna hear them play that rock n
roll beat

CUT TO

Three TEENAGE BOYS wearing matching cardigans sing an overly
sentimental doo-wop song about finding true love and getting
their hearts broken

TEENAGE BOYS
Cause theres nothing left
for me to do
Or say
Though Id always hoped
that youd be mine someday

CUT TO

AUTUMN 17 walks onto the stage carrying a guitar She
adjusts the microphone She has dark circles under her eyes
as if she hasn’t slept in weeks Shes dressed like a 1950s
rebel or greaser wearing jeans and a satin pink jacket

She starts to strum and sing Her voice is filled with
sadness She sings something much darker from the period
Hes Got the Power
AUTUMN
He makes me do things I dont want
to do
He makes me say things I dont want
to say
And even though I want to break
away

I cant stop saying I adore him

I cant stop doing things for him
Hes got the power

The power of love over me

Autumn looks into the audience Several rows in she sees her
proud but ineffective young MOTHER Her mother sits with
her deadbeat boyfriend and a couple of small kids

Autumn looks away from her mom and back out toward the
general audience

AUTUMN (CONTD)
He makes me stay when I dont want
to stay
He makes me go when I dont want to
go
And though I try to break the spell
I know I cant stop saying I adore
him

She looks around the audience again while singing A group of
boys watch her and whisper One ROWDY STUDENT cups his hand
around his mouth He disguises his voice making it sound
deeper and shouts-—

ROWDY STUDENT

They laugh but the joke goes nowhere Autumn freezes at
first but pushes through the moment and continues to sing

AUTUMN
I cant stop doing things for him
Hes got the power
The power of love over me

She holds the note and her voice trembles through the entire
auditorium

CUT TO BLACK

pain as she sings

AUTUMN
Dont let the sun catch you cryin
The nights the time for all your
tears
Your heart may be broken tonight
But tomorrow in the morning light
Dont let the sun catch you cryin
The night-time shadows disappear
And with them go all your tears
For the morning will bring joy
For every girl and boy
So dont let the sun catch you

cryin

We know that cryins not a bad
thing

But stop your cryin when the birds
sing

It may be hard to discover

That youve been left for another
But dont forget that loves a game
And it can always come again

Oh dont let the sun catch you
cryin
Dont let the sun catch you cryin

He puts his arm around her Skylar is stiff in his arms but
