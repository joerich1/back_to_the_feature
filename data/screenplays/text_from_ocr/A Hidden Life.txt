PRE-CREDIT SEQUENCE - TIANANMEN SQUARE (BEIJING 1989) 1

A man in a white shirt holding a grocery sack stands in
front of a line of tanks blocking their progress toward
Tiananmen Square

NEWSREEL FOOTAGE FROM THE 1930s (BandW) - OVERTURE

Crowds wait for Hitler to appear At last his car approaches
A roar goes up They worship him Hundreds of thousands
Tears of adoration sting their eyes They stretch their hands
out towards him

The Fiihrer smiles his confidence unbounded

EXT ST RADEGUND UPPER AUSTRIA - IN SUDDEN SILENCE 2

A single man raking hay Franz Jagerstatter 36 years old
In the distance the steeple of a church and the village where
he lives A few dozen houses the mountains rising up beyond
them

St Radegund is a small peaceful village of 500 souls At
its center stands a small square on one side a Gasthaus or
inn on the other the rectory

A river flows nearby The Salzach Cows graze in the sun The
clank of their bells the lazy swish of their tails

Returning home from the fields Franz exchanges greetings
with his neighbors A burn-in reads “Austria 1940”

EXT JAGERSTATTER HOUSE 3

He joins his wife Franziska 30 Their daughters 2 and 3
years old run out of the barn which stands next to the
house A calf just born wobbles to its feet Franz calls
Franziska by her nickname Fani

FANI
Girls help your father

The girl’s names are Rosi and Maridl Franz picks Maridl up
and puts her on his shoulders while Rosi begs to be taken up
the same way A bell rings in the distance
SCENES OF ST R LIFE - GASTHAUS 4

Franz dances on the terrace of the inn Fani laughs and
claps

Together they gather plums and apples from the trees in their
small orchard

Fani yokes up a cow and sets her to plow

Armed with stones the children drive crows off the fresh-
sown fields

Fani milks the cows makes soap churns butter She
negotiates with the local miller to have their wheat ground
into flour

Rosalia Franz’s mother lives with the family and joins them
out in the fields She is a widow Franz’s father died in the
First World War

FRANZ
Mother stay out of the sun

Husband and wife help their neighbors and are helped in turn
haying whitewashing their houses digging out a well They
rely on each other a close-knit community

INTEXT ST R CHURCH 5

Beyond his work as a farmer Franz serves aS a sacristan at
the church He trims the candles polishes the pews rings

the bell He refuses to accept any payment the parishioners
offer him for his role in arranging baptisms weddings and

funerals

He watches as a painter refurbishes the ceiling with cherubs
and seraphim in transports of ecstasy

He pinches the dead blooms off the roses that grow over the
graves of the churchyard outside
INT J HOUSE 6

Franz helps his mother up a flight of stairs She is a
brooding woman worn by trouble and care

NEWSREEL FOOTAGE (BandW) - WAR IN RUSSIA 7

Howitzers light up the sky Stalingrad Kursk

INT J HOUSE - NIGHT 8

Franz and Fani put the children to bed The girls cry out
with delight as their father makes shadows on the ceiling
Soon they are asleep and the house is still

FANI
These last weeks you’re different
What is it Talk with me

She remembers him in a happy time riding through the Alps on
his motorcycle at a time when he still owned one His smile
as she looked at him

There has been no threat to their happiness Only a moment a
few weeks ago when she heard a faint roar and looking up
barely made out the silhouettes of British planes bombers
in the sky high above far away

How could the war touch their kingdom or disturb their
peace when they are so insignificant in the scheme of
things so far from Vienna and Berlin

He touches her belly She is pregnant now

FANI (CONTD)
We have all we want All we need
Nothing can change our love We
have our children Our home Each
other Nothing can take our
happiness away

They pass under a wreath they have set above their door
FRANZ
Yes my wife We’ll always have
each other
BABY 9
A child is born A girl Loisi Her two older sisters look on

in amazement Franz turns to Fani and laughs Their happiness
is complete

The next day they hear the ring of a little bell The Postman
appears on his bicycle with a letter Franz reads it

I’ve been called up

Are you afraid

EXT PARADE GROUND (20 OCTOBER 1940) 12
Franz marches in step with a group of draftees

FRANZ (0S)

After six months we’ll be done
with this training Will the war
be over For now I can only be
with you in my thoughts It’s hard
when I think of you -- when I
remember our home How is our
baby When I come home I’1l be
surprised at how big she is
Have you considered using a horse
I don’t think your team of cows
would be offended if you put them
in retirement

ROSALIA FRANZS MOTHER 13

Franz’s mother Rosalia helps Fani load a pig into a car

Fani is courteous to her mother-in-law but Rosalia answers
with a certain degree of distrust and suspicion as if she

imagined Franz had married beneath him

EXT FIELDS ST R 14

Fani reaps a field of fresh grass with Resie and a family of
neighbors
FANI (0S)
Your mother helps me in the
fields It’s no good when we have
to rely too much on the neighbors
always asking for help and
thanking them The Strohofers have
been kind

(she thanks the neighbors)

The pig almost didn’t fit in the
car Only a boy came for it It
weighed 326 pounds There was a
wedding at the church

(a happy bride outside the church)
I’ve finished tilling the oats At
the start I had a hard time with
the potatoes It brought me to the
point of tears

She puts hay up in the barn

15 INT J HOUSE - THE CHILDREN
Fani feeds the children and puts them to bed

FANI (0S)
Rosi is always asking about you
When we’re going to bed she says
“Papa’s locked out” At meals
“Save some for Papa” If I get up
at night “Is Papa home” Her
sister tells her “He’ll bring
sausage”

16 THE CHILDREN
The older girls play with Loisi their new sister

FRANZ (0S)
You know how the children bring me
joy A feeling of good fortune
comes over me here so that tears
flow from my eyes when I think of
them and you and our reunion
Youre doing so much When I come
home there’1ll be no more work for
me I’1l become a babysitter

She scolds the girls when they get into mischief as often
they do

EXT J FARM 17

Fani washes the cows She churns milk into butter She
gathers a wagonload of straw She lays the hay out in
windrows to dry

FANI (0S)

I have to scold the girls They
argue terribly They’re always
demanding my attention Maridl
hits Rosi who says “You’re bad”
Then Maridl says “I’m good” and
Rosi says “I’m good you’re bad”
Maridl pulled a leg off of Rosi’s
doll and said “Now the other one
comes off too” Rosi wanted to go
to the doctor to get the leg put
back on

(a man in a dark forest)
When Sterz is done with his work
he goes into the forest and weeps
Toni Strohofer is always hungry

(a hungry man stealing beets)
I could use your help washing the
cows They’re always pleasant in
the morning when they eat the
leaves of the beets Mathilde
doesn’t wash them before she milks
them so I wash them myself

Mathilde a lonely girl knitting as she tends the sheep
FANI (0S) (CONTD)
I sold a few pounds of cabbage 3
pfennigs a pound Frau Huber
bought 44
Fani notices a man walking by looking at Resie

FANI (CONTD)
He’s interested in you Look

RESIE
I don’t trust men
EXT KASERNE - COURTYARD 18
Franz with other soldiers from his unit

He sees how they defer to the Nazi captain who lords it over
them puffed up with a sense of his importance

The children are older now
Franz’s mother holds her in leading strings

FRANZ (0S)
Much beloved wife I am grateful
for every word you send
Hopefully winter won’t come too
soon The farmers have their beets
still in the field Are you glad
we don’t have beets

J FARM

FANI (0S)
Loisi is a little pest She always
wants to be held Rosi wanted to
take your picture to bed with her
tonight You were supposed to
sleep beside her I told her that
when father comes home he will
She answered that father is
already home They gave your photo
so many kisses Rosi recognizes
you but Maridl simply said
“Man”

This morning I was picking up the
piglets Szailer was there The
calf is now five weeks old We
worked hard this past week
spreading the manure Toni Stott
was given 4 months in prison
because he spoke out He opened
his mouth too wide You’1l not do
the same Those who speak out lose
their leave

EXT ROAD - MOVING MOTORCYCLE

FRANZ (0S)
Dearly beloved wife I was
delighted to hear from you

They watch newsreels of Nazi victories in the West shown on
a bedsheet strung from a clothesline

Franz listens as his comrades roar with delight at the
misfortunes of their neighbors Bewildered French peasants
gaze at their German conquerors ask them for food or fuel

Loisi has learned to crawl

Franz speeds down a road on his motorcycle in a military

FRANZ (0S) (CONTD)
Hopefully the straw will not run
out too early in the spring You
must use it sparingly Have you
greased the scythes and hung them
up Warm greeting from your loving
husband Franz Many warm
greetings to Mother too and to
the little ones See you again

Franz watches an officer swagger and shout A cadet passing
by gives him a Hitler salute Franz looks away pretends not
to see

EXT J FARM 21
Fani and Franz’s mother whitewash the house

FANI (0S)
Besenbock will be called away We
must send him a goose

(the girls scuffle)

Loisi is a dear sparrow Always
trying new things She doesn’t go
far yet At most a step She
flutters about and falls Then she
is up again She keeps your mother
busy She wants to be in every
scuffle though she always gets
the worst of it I feel badly for
her and I cannot help her Her
sisters are always the same
rascals Tomorrow I’1l do the
cultivating Hopefully I’1l hit
no hard spots I have a fear of
such places

Fani works in the fields spreading manure with a pitchfork
Fani greases the scythes and hangs them up in the barn

EXT LAKE (SOUTH TYROL) 22

While on maneuvers Franz meets a fellow soldier a few years
younger than himself His name is Rogowski

There is no pretense about this man He is kind generous
honest and endlessly optimistic He lives in the moment
forgetful of the past with no thought to the future

Rogowski’s face wears the innocent expression of a child and
like a child everything he says or does is spontaneous and
genuine

Franz wonders how he lives as he does

Franz’s unit is bivouacked by a lake After early morning
calisthenics they learn their weapons

Franz plunges his bayonet into a straw dummy

FRANZ (0S)
It need not be that everything in
this world comes about as we want
for ourselves We don’t see the
future It may be a good thing
that we don’t Let’s resolve to
begin the new year in confidence
and good cheer I have a few
oranges for you Speak with
Schirk They have the best oats
Whether our oats are also among
the best is a good question

Concerning the butchering of the
swine do not wait for me

Fani and Franz’s mother prepare a sow for butchering

EXT KASERNE 23

A Sergeant takes Franz aside

SERGEANT
Lucky man You’ve been let go from
military service -- to manage your

farm France has surrendered
Well have peace now

EXT ST R SQUARE 24
Franz returns to Radegund Home He greets his neighbors as
he passes through the main square on the way back to his
farm

EXT J FARM 25
Fani and the children rush out to greet him

FRANZ
You see We just had to pray

They celebrate Franz dances for the children In the windows
a light burns past dusk

EXT VILLAGE SQUARE 26

A few days later Franz comes across a neighbor in the
village square a farmer named HESSLER His friends are
consoling him There has been some unexpected event

FRANZ
Hessler what is it

HESSLER
I’ve been called up We thought
there would be peace but this war
goes on I don’t know why

His friends look at each other Their eyes dart left and
right

FRIEND
Shhh

They pat him on the back It could happen to anyone

EXT FIELD - LATER ALONE 27
Franz questions his friend Now they are alone

FRANZ
Do you believe in what we’re
fighting for

HESSLER
A little No Not really

FRANZ

Weve invaded other countries
Stolen their land And now we’re
doing it again Aren’t they the
heroes who fight against us --
who defend their homes

(no reply)
Is something right -- just because
the crowd is shouting it

Hessler bows his head

EXT WOODS 28

Passing through the woods Franz sees a madman in the
distance Dishevelled his hair and beard grown out a mad
look in his eyes of fear or dread It seems the poor fellow
had not expected anyone to pass this way He looks at Franz
for a moment then slips off into the darkness of the trees

INT J HOUSE
Fani can see that Franz is holding something back

FANI
What is it
(after a pause)
Toni opened his mouth too wide

FRANZ
I wouldnt do anything that would
bring you reproach

He looks in on his children He kisses them as they sleep

FANI (0S)
To have a good husband -- a home --
they’re enough to make you
happy To love and be loved is

the greatest happiness on earth

INT J BEDROOM - NIGHT

Franz wakes up with a gasp He lights a candle Fani looks at

him startled

FRANZ
I had a dream I saw my father I
asked him what it was like in
death Could he tell me He shook
his head Then I saw a train --
a wonderful train -- coming
through the mountains The
locomotive was powerful -- dark --
it drew the children They ran to
it and weren’t held back You
couldnt see where it was going --
just the trees and fields
flashing by

EXT TRAIN (STOCK FOOTAGE BandW) - DREAM

A train A black locomotive Coal is shovelled into
furnace The tracks weave in and out Pistons drive
engine forward an overwhelming relentless force

FRANZ (0S)
Then a voice -- the voice said
“This train is going into
darkness” I think it was a
message

the
the

Franz on his motorcycle the wind in his hair the lovely
sense of being free of all constraint rushing on

NEXT MORNING 32

The next morning at breakfast

FRANZ
Those other men were like
brothers
EXT ECKINGER HOF - DAY 33

The neighbors debate with Franz

NEIGHBOR
Who are you Even the Cardinal
ordered us to pray for Hitler --
to ring the bells on his birthday
Fly the swastika from the steeple
You forget

ECKINGER
You can’t blame the Cardinal for
that He hoped by doing it that
the regime would be more tolerant
toward the church But now the
priests are sent to concentration
camps Church processions banned
Mass on feast days even
Christmas prohibited unless the
feast falls on Sunday We don’t
have a say It’s them up the hill
that decide our fate

Officials from a fortress near St Radegund wander through
the street singing

EXT FORTRESS (BURG SAND) 34
The fortress far away Seat of the military authorities it
sits on a high hill overlooking the valley below It stands

alone in the dusk

ECKINGER (0S)
What do you say Franz

EXT FIELDS - WIESENKREUZ 35

Franz wanders through the fields disturbed by the sense that
a decision may soon be required of him one that will put the
happiness of his family at risk and set him at odds with the
village which he has loved since he was a boy

Out in the fields a crucifix stands on a pole a gabled roof
above it to shelter it from the snow Uncanny It stops him
in his tracks

The figure on the crucifix looks down at him in silence
Franz turns away embarrassed The path wanders on through
the fields of barley But he cannot leave He looks up again
takes off his hat There is no one else in sight The fields
thrum with crickets

Franz takes off his hat afraid There are monuments to pain
everywhere in these mountains So incongruous What is it he
now finds in that face

Franz can tell no one Especially not those closest to him
He cannot tell his wife

EXT ST R CHURCH 36

One afternoon Franz is cleaning up the church when he comes
upon a painter a stranger to these parts

OHLENDORFF A PAINTER
Im here to touch up the ceiling

Franz watches the stranger mix his paints Above them on the
ceiling spreads a pleasant view of the heavens

INC POV ON THE CEILING 37

OHLENDORFF (0S)
They look up and imagine that if
theyd lived back in his time
they wouldn’t have done what the
others did They would’ve stood by
him They wouldn’t have run His
friends did though They would
too

As the painter is talking scenes from Franz’s life flash
through his mind

FLASHBACK MONTAGE - EXT FIELD 38
Franz sows a newly-ploughed field

OHLENDORFF (0S)
And I -- do I imitate him No I
live off his life I make a living
by presenting him

FLASHBACK MONTAGE - EXT FIELD 39

Franz works with his neighbors remembers how they help each
other here neighbors depending on each other like a family
and drawing closer to each other because of it

What else is there in life but getting closer to each other

OHLENDORFF (0S)
Others will look at this picture
and think that sympathizing with
him -- being moved by his story --
will benefit them in the beyond

FLASHBACK MONTAGE - EXT FIELDS 40

Franz cuts wheat with a scythe stopping from time to time to
sharpen it with a whetstone he carries on his waist

OHLENDORFF (0S)
They’11 count themselves lucky
that they didn’t live in times
like ours when your life might be
demanded of you

FLASHBACK MONTAGE - EXT FIELDS 41
Franz threshes the wheat by hand
OHLENDORFF (0S)
Instead of suffering for the
truth I paint it
FLASHBACK MONTAGE - EXT BARN 42
The girls leap down from the hay loft onto the fresh straw
OHLENDORFF (0S)
I turn the suffering of the brave

into my livelihood So people can
look up from these pews and dream

FLASHBACK MONTAGE - J HOUSE 43

Fani pulls a loaf of bread out of the oven

FLASHBACK MONTAGE - CHICKEN COOP 44

A hen shelters her chicks

FLASHBACK MONTAGE - INT BELL TOWER 45

Franz cranks up the counterweights for the clock in the bell
tower

OHLENDORFF (0S)
I paint this comfortable man A
halo over his head Some day I’1l
paint the true one

EXT FIELDS 46

Franz rings the bell Its sound rolls out through the fields

FLASHBACK MONTAGE - EXT ST R CHURCH 47
Franz looks on a procession The men carry banners and
statues A statue sits on a platform set aside ignored but
seemingly looking on with what emotion he cannot tell

EXT GRAVEYARD - RAIN 48
Franz remembers a man bent over a fresh grave by the church
weeping in the driving rain spreading an umbrella to keep
the water from soaking down into the freshly-turned sod

EXT FIELD 49

Fani in the fields bent under a load of hay She goes
quietly about her tasks

Franz comes forward and kisses her She wonders what has
moved him to out here in the open just now

FRANZ
Can I do anything for you

She shakes her head

He sees his mother her arms hardened by a life of ceaseless
labor like the limbs of an old tree that has passed through
many a storm

He plays with the elder two girls whom he has put up into a
tree to pick apples They look down at him from the branches
and laugh Their little sister hugs his knees clamoring to
be picked up

Franz takes Fani’s hand

FRANZ (CONTD)

I’ve always felt I didn’t have
much to give you But you took me
Even though I was a plain man

FANI
I took the best man I’ve ever
known

How could he have loved anyone who came short of that mark
FRANZ
Maybe others thought you could’ve
done better

FANI
Our children have a good father

RURAL SCENES - CATTLE TRUCK PLOW HORSES ETC 50
Images flash through Franz’s mind A plow breaking through
the earth Oxen Patient resigned as he waters them A
gaggle of geese None strays far from the others

Taking up a jug of water he has left to cool in a shock of
wheat some bumblebees fly out He laughs as he retreats
swatting them away

Hot metal hammered out at a blacksmith’s forge

Dusk Cattle in the back of a truck on their way to the
slaughterhouse They stir and stamp uneasily

INT POOR WOMANS COTTAGE 51
Franz cleans the cottage of a poor old woman an invalid He

prepares a meal for her and cheers her with his conversation
Someone rarely visited by others

EXT GASTHAUS 52
Franz sits alone at the end of the day drinking a beer

His neighbors are gathered nearby The mayor The blacksmith
and farrier The policeman The clerk

They sing old songs Franz does not join in

SPRING FESTIVAL 53
Radegund celebrates the Fasching festival

The people gather in a procession to drive out winter and
prepare for the return of spring They wear carved wooden
masks with crowns of flowers on their heads They ring
cowbells and dance

Why would he set himself at odds with those whom he has grown
up to cherish -- to whom he owes every consideration

EXT PATH 54
Franz passes a neighbor on his way home through the fields

NEIGHBOR
Heil Hitler

Franz ignores him The neighbor frowns waiting for an
explanation

FRANZ
Pfui Hitler

The neighbor looks around to see if anyone has heard then
goes silently on his way Franz trembles all over his heart
is in his throat

EXT ST R CHURCH 55

Franz is tidying up around the church when he sees Fr
Fiirthauer the young pastor of the parish He has taken the
place of another priest Fr Josef Karobath who a few years
earlier was jailed for giving an anti-Nazi sermon and
subsequently banished from the district Fr Fiirthauer has
good reason to be careful about what he says to this troubled
young man coming to him for guidance

INT ST R CHURCH 56

Franz finishes ringing the bell No one has come to mass
today They are alone

FRANZ
Father -- I’m troubled -- if I’m
called up I can’t serve We are
killing innocent people Raiding
other countries Preying on the
weak And the priests call them
heroes even saints -- the
soldiers that do this

FR FURTHAUER
Have you spoken with anyone else
Your wife Your family
(Franz shakes his head)
Don’t you think you ought to
consider the consequences of your
actions -- for them

Fiirthauer is wary of Franz who might after all be a Gestapo
agent trying to see if he can extract some incautious word
from the priest

FR FURTHAUER (CONTD)
You’d almost surely be shot

FRANZ
Yes

FR FURTHAUER
Your sacrifice would benefit no
one

FRANZ
You might be right More I fear
that I might do--

FR FURTHAUER
Wrong Which is the greater wrong

FRANZ
Speak freely Father

FR FURTHAUER
I have often wished that I might
act on all I believe But I have
to think whom I might harm -- Why
do you look at me that way Youd
be taking your own life

FRANZ
If it were that --

FR FURTHAUER
Ill speak with the Bishop about
your case A wiser man than I

EXT STREET 57
The priest takes Franz aside

FR FURTHAUER
No Catholic who refuses military
service will get any support from
his spiritual leaders You know
that don’t you Can you blame
them For all they know you might
be a Gestapo agent coming to trap
them with your questions -- to
lead them into an act of treason
To bring the wrath of the State
down on our Church Theyd arrest
any confessor who showed the
slightest sign of sympathy for
such inclinations

Franz searches his eyes Is the priest really in sympathy
with him and just can’t say so openly

FR FURTHAUER (CONTD)
What can one do
EXT VILLAGE SQUARE 58
Now aS Franz passes through the village it seems to him
that his neighbors might not all be as happy or as close as

he once imagined

That man in the woods The cry of a lunatic woman he heard
one evening across a field from a distant darkened house

Swifts chase each other through the streets The sky is full
of their cries

EXT COUSIN’S FARMHOUSE 59
Franz debates with his cousin whether he should refuse

military service or not He still hasn’t told Fani about his
qualms

His cousin warns him not to speak about the matter with
others in the village There are jealous angry people A
few They might report him

INT J HOUSE 60

Franz has told her She pretends this is a question they need
not face

FANI
(after a silence)
They won’t call you up They need
farmers How else are people going
to eat

INT GIRL’S BEDROOM 61
They look at the girls asleep in their beds
FANI (0S)

Ask and youll be answered
INT MASTER BEDROOM 62
Later Fani prepares their bed and lays out his clothes It
seems that she is making every effort to be kind and
thoughtful as though it were suddenly clear to her how
precious her husband is to her though her devotion to him
has been more than apparent already
THE POSTMAN 63
The Postman rides by on his bicycle rings his bell and
waves Franz and Fani wait in fear and suspense every time he
appears He might deliver the same induction notice to Franz
that his neighbor Hessler received
INT BARN 64

Mother and son muck out the stalls

FRANZ
What is it mother

ROSALIA
Will you not spare your family Do
you hate your wife Your children

FRANZ
No

ROSALIA
Did I bring you into the world for
this

FRANZ

Who’s been talking with you

ROSALIA
How would she maintain the farm
With three young children How
would she plow

EXT ORCHARD 65
Franz and Fani weed the orchard

FRANZ
I went up to the mountains They
tell me what to do The river
does

EXT ALPS 66

Franz has come up to the high mountains on his motorcycle
There is a sudden silence when he shuts the engine off

High above stand the inaccessible peaks The eternal snow and
rock Below the peaceful sound of a river flowing nearby A
distant cowbell

The bluebells and vetch Clover Fireweed Negligence
vacancy Peace Why not always

O for the wings of a dove To fly far from trouble and
grief

To his wife Franz presents a face of confidence and strength
but inwardly he is assailed with torment doubt and fear

From time to time we hear him inwardly expressing those
feelings or recalling his past to strengthen himself against
them

FRANZ OS (INTERIOR VOICE)
My wife You seemed like someone
come from heaven Humble Kind
Through your eyes you sent a
sweetness into my heart

FRANZ OS (INTERIOR VOICE) (CONTD)
You make me feel I have no enemy
in all the world

EXT BARN - RESIE 67
Fani’s sister takes Franz aside

RESIE
You took Fani’s happiness into
your hands She might have had
other men Not many besides you
would think it a duty to add to
their troubles this way

An image of the onrushing train passes through Franz’s mind

INT LINZ CATHEDRAL 68

Franz and Fani have come to Linz to meet with the Bishop
They look up in awe as they enter the cathedral The organist
is practising a hymn

INT WAITING ROOM 69

Franz paces back and forth Bishop Fliessen has kept them
waiting for more than an hour

CLERK
The Bishop will be with you
shortly

INT BISHOP’S CONSULTING ROOM 70

Franz bows to the Bishop who holds out his hand and after
some pleasantries moves quickly to business

BISHOP
You have a responsibility -- to
those within your private circle
Your family Have you had a
personal revelation from above
Was your conscience told to ignore
the instruction of those
responsible for your spiritual
guidance

FRANZ
I’m not sure

BISHOP
Not sure I have a responsibility
for the souls of your parish It
weighs heavily on me I wouldn’t
be able to sleep were I either to
keep silent -- or to speak out at
the wrong time Each of us must
fulfill his duty -- willingly
loyally -- devote himself wholly
to the service of his
Fatherland You know the words
of the Apostle let every man be
subject to the powers placed over
him

FRANZ
And if our leader is -- a monster -
- what does one do

BISHOP
Our home’s at stake Our people
Be a man Be strong Our Leader

knows war’s horror He himself was
a soldier at the front He tried
to spare Europe from this
conflict But there was no
avoiding it Our enemies would
make us slaves

71 INT WAITING ROOM

Fani paces back and forth When Franz comes out of the
consulting room he looks sad or fearful

FRANZ

(in a whisper)
I think he was afraid -- that I
might be a spy He said we have to
obey But that was in other times
When there were clergy who could
be obeyed -- They don’t dare
commit themselves Or it could be
their turn next

(later)
They’re flesh and blood as we
are They can be weak Maybe
they’re even more tempted

EXT CLOISTERS 72

Franz sees a group of monks tending a garden smiling and
chatting amiably It seems they have no trouble with their
conscience They live unperturbed by the world

Fani wraps her arms around him -- determined to support him
not to insist on herself but they do have three girls

Perhaps he will be exempted if ever he is called to military
service or assigned to a hospital job Perhaps he would
accept such a position Perhaps he won’t be called at all

HITLER (NEWSREEL) 73
Images of Hitler his face half-seen

FANI (0S)
What difference will it make
He’ll go on doing as he pleases

EXT PATH THROUGH WOODS 74
They walk home in silence Franz’s heart full to bursting

FRANZ (0S)
You didn’t make the world the way
it is

EXT J HOUSE 75

The girls run out to greet them Rosalia looks on

EXT FIELDS 76

They are working in the fields when Franz’s mother turns to
him

ROSALIA

Good children obey Their mother
and father only want what’s good
for them They know it If they
work hard they can buy a house
with a garden -- live happily to
the end of their days

(after a pause)
A man brings his wages home to his
wife

ROSALIA (CONTD)

She puts them away so that if
ever they get sick they can be
nursed at home and won’t need
charity -- to raise their children
or live into old age People get
what they deserve Bad workmen
come to bad ends

Fani glancing up -- sees a sow’s carcass hanging from a pole
outside the barn

EXT FIELD 77

Franz trembles inwardly What does his honor require of him
It seems that no one can tell him the answer He alone must
decide Never has he felt so alone -- he who has always been
so close to his family his neighbors

EXT GASTHAUS BEER GARDEN 78

Franz sits in the beer garden surrounded by friends
including the Mayor and the Policeman

POLICEMAN
He got us into this war The young
men are gone --

MAYOR KRAUS
He did what he had to He wasn’t
content to watch his nation go
under He saw what we’d become No
destiny Everyone chasing after
comfort success No ideals

BLACKSMITH SPITZ
Breaking into homes Tearing
the earrings off women’s ears My
mother’s old I hope she dies
soon

MAYOR KRAUS
People saw that a fraud had been
perpetrated against us We found
out that liberalism is a sham
Democracy A mask for the
commercial spirit If we don’t
lift the youth out of this swamp
theyll drown in it

The Mayor is a member of the Nazi party Franz has looked up
to him since he was a child No ones dares to contradict him

MAYOR KRAUS (CONT’D)
Let’s be glad democracy has died
See where it led us To deadlock
Paralysis Slaves of the rich It
has no strength to stop the
crisis Hitler is a new era A new
truth

(turning to Franz)

Your father would have stood here
and told you the same He was in
the war He fought What did he
die for In the trenches The mud

EXT BONFIRE - NIGHT 79
The Mayor addresses a gathering of men in SA uniforms

MAYOR KRAUS
Flame teach us Light us Show us
the road There’s no way back
Flame ignite Hearts burn

THE FOHN 80

The F6hn blows over the fields -- a dry burning wind that
melts the snow and clears the skies Avalanches are loosed
The risk of fire is great Everyone is on the alert ina
state of nervous expectation

ECKINGER
The snow looks clear We might be
able to send the flocks up early

MONTAGE 81
Franz debates what he should do Omens of death flash through
his mind an open door a curtain beyond which he cannot see
a scythe cutting through the hay the Salzach’s far shore
Evil takes on so many disguises His conscience is restless
He vacillates No one can give him any advice in these

circumstances even his own bishop

All that was familiar to him now seems far away

EXT J HOUSE 82

Men in Nazi uniforms have come by the house to seek his
family’s contribution to a collection they are making on
behalf of the war effort

Franz looks at them says nothing The men go away
astonished This will set tongues wagging

INT J HOUSE 83

Franz hears a knock on the door He opens to find the Mayor
standing before him

MAYOR KRAUS
You have refused to contribute to
our collection on behalf of the
veterans Their families

This has clearly fanned the flame of suspicion in the
community

MAYOR KRAUS (CONT’D)

That is not like you
(after a pause)

I also hear that you have refused
to accept the family allowance
and other subsidies that the
State would generously have
provided you Why Are you afraid
to fight Your father A brave
man You never knew him You were
just a boy I know what he would
expect of you

Fani listens from the next room alarmed

EXT FIELDS 84

Franz holds his hands out to the youngest girl She teeters
towards him It hasn’t been long since she took her first
steps

From up in a tree the older two girls drop apples down to
their mother She catches them in her apron

Franz walks by the Salzach The river flows peacefully along
whispering murmuring -- what What does it tell him He
wishes for some oracle clear voice

He bows his head in the field with his wife as the angelus
rings in the Tittmoning church to the west

They dig up potatoes tiny figures in the vast landscape
Fani sings as she works Peasant faces Baked by the sun

Their hearts cringe at the sign of the Postman who rings his
bell as he rides by and gives them a friendly wave They are
not comfortable until he is gone

The thud of cattle’s hooves ring through the walls of the
barn It stands next to the house where they sleep so they
can profit from the animals’ warmth

A scarecrow Geese The sound of a rooster Light struggling
through the slats of the barn doors

Franz digs a grave The churchyard is silent except for the
sound of his shovel Empty silent still

Where does his duty lie

Franz digs out a well Fani’s voice is indistinct as in the
light thirty feet above she speaks with a neighbor He looks
up toward the blank featureless sky What would it be like
to be away from her forever buried in the earth this way
Water gathers at his feet

FANI
Franz -- you know how proud you
are How stubborn Make sure it
isn’t -- that

The truth is he can’t be sure if his defiance is inspired by
conscience or instead by pride She touches a nerve

Is it a sign that you are right with your conscience that
everything goes smoothly for you

The ticking of a clock A train whistle far away Franz
trembles under the burden of his decision

FANI (CONTD)
Are you taking on too much What
can we do The world is stronger

Fani looks away Surely it will not come to a crisis She
believes if they are good everything will come out right
This is what she tells the children at bedtime

FANI (CONTD)

Quiet now Don’t fight Sleep
(whispering to the eldest)
Every day’s not Sunday Every day
you wont have sunshine But every

day you’re dear to us

Franz listens from the next room

INTEXT BARN HAY RICKS 85

Fani and her sister weave hay into a drying rack Later they
ride their bicycles home

RESIE
Does anyone else know Just the
priest His mother looks at me
coldly Like I was to blame I
want what you want I can’t bear
that he makes you suffer He makes
a choice for you too

FANI
Yes

RESIE
Does he know what he’s doing to
you Tell him Pride That’s what

it is
FANI
No I don’t think so
RESIE
Why don’t you resist -- fight with

him You do nothing to stand in
his way He does what he likes --
with your happiness

FANI
I trust him

RESIE
Is he just stubborn
FRANZ’S POV ON RESIE 86
Resie does not speak to Franz as they pass each other by
Franz is left to guess why He risks cutting himself not only
from his community but from his family as well
EXT OBERSTALLER ALM 87

Franz walks though the alms the high summer pastures where
the farmers bring their cattle up to graze

He enters a deserted village He looks around puzzled Where
have the others gone There is no one else in sight

EXT FIELDS

Franz talks with his neighbor Spitz the Blacksmith as he

pounds a blade out on an anvil

FRANZ
If you don’t think well of me
never mind That’s neither here
nor there

BLACKSMITH SPITZ
Don’t make things worse for
yourself The horse may have a
heavy load but it won’t help him
to throw it over into a ditch when
it’s his own feed

Till now it hasn’t occurred to Franz that any of his
neighbors would consider such a thing

BLACKSMITH SPITZ (CONT’D)
Don’t sail into the wind Wait for
the storm to subside Then you can
do your good Your wife will be
destitute -- Your mother will have
no fire in the winter

FRANZ
We’re going to pay for these
crimes

BLACKSMITH SPITZ

You wont forget the evenings we
played together in the fields
Till the dark came down You loved
us all We were friends together
Take a friend’s advice Leave well
alone You come too late There’s
nothing we can do

(seeing Franz unmoved)
Well then I leave you to your
fate Let’s not quarrel I only
tell you what you already know

FANI’S POV ON THE CHILDREN

The sight of their children playing with a duck fills
mother with dread

EXT CHURCHYARD

Franz has come to visit Fiirthauer the priest

their

FR FURTHAUER

Don’t say it

(after a pause)
Does a man have the right to let
himself be put to death for the
truth We can’t all be martyrs --
Could it possibly please God --
an act that would destroy your
family’s happiness

(Franz looks away)
I know you were closer to my
predecessor Perhaps you had more
faith in -- his judgement

FRANZ
Ah Fr Karobath He smoked He
liked wine He liked to hunt but
he never came back with anything
He was a bad shot We teased him

Gradually the voice of the priest becomes that of the
painter who was restoring the ceiling of the church

OHLENDORFF (0S)
The trouble with Christians is
that no one wants to kill them
anymore There was a time when
youd be afraid to say you
followed him because it meant so
much Now it means nothing

EXT ROAD 91
Franz sees how the neighbors treat Fani coldly Radegund has
turned against them Their home Those whom they love

INT J HOUSE - NIGHT 92
Fani can tell there is something on her husband’s mind She
dreads what it might be She avoids speaking with him about
it as though by saying nothing he might in time forget these

new whims and come to his senses

FRANZ
Tell me

FANI
Are the children asleep

FRANZ
Did they say anything to you I
saw them speaking to you by the
road

FANI
They said their husbands have gone
off To war Why should they fight
to save us

FRANZ
Did they hurt you With their
words

FANI
I don’t care

FRANZ
Are you crying

FANI
I never cry It gives me a
headache

FRANZ

I love you

FANI
I know

Franz blows out the candle

EXT MILL 93

Franz has brought a load of oats to Trakl the miller They
step outside by the water wheel as the grain is separated
from the chaff

TRAKL

If we could just see the beginning
of his kingdom If we could see
only the sun of his kingdom rise
But -- Christ came and went
Nothing happened Years go by so
Many years And nothing Nothing
ever

(over the thud of the wheel)
So hard to make the good grow up
One spark is all that’s needed to
set the field on fire A single
match

TRAKL (CONTD)
It takes months to lay it out --
to plough to plant it -- more
work to make a crop and then the
sword takes one minute We’re the
party of the plough They’re the
party of the sword We’ll always
be beaten

Never has the kingdom of perdition
spread so far A flood We have to
learn how to live in this flood

EXT FIELD - FANI WITH HER SISTER - FIRE 94

Fani and Resie walk down the furrows each with a sickle
cutting the bad weeds out of the wheat

FANI
Hell get an exemption I know it
They need farmers

They gather the bad weeds in bundles and burn them The grain
they bring into the barn

EXT J HOUSE 95
The postman rings Fani and Franz look up with a start

They go out to meet him He hands them a letter in an
official envelope looking away as he does

Franz rocks like a tree in the wind

They go away from the children out to the field in back of
the house beneath the apple tree There he opens the
envelope It is what they thought

FANI
You could hide in the woods I
could bring you food We could run
away to the mountains where
nobody could find us To
Switzerland

FRANZ
The border is closed
EXT VILLAGE SQUARE 96

Others have heard of his refusal

MAYOR KRAUS
You know what this means Not only
for your family For the whole
town You’ll be hanged Your wife
and children will have no one to
support them Your mother will die
unconsoled

97 FRANZS MOTHER 97
His mother looks at him in disbelief

ROSALIA
Is this how you repay us

Her will is set against his

ROSALIA (CONTD)
Youve thrown away everything you
had and gone down a step in life --
when your father gave you the
means of rising

FRANZ
We differ mother I’m sorry But
I’m grateful to you for wishing me
the best

ROSALIA
I have no more to say I only hope
your own children make you a
better return for the pains you’ve
spent on them None of us can
imagine how you could get into
such a position when you’re so law-
abiding It’s a riddle I’m an old
woman and the additional work
will be considerable How could TI
ever have imagined that in the
evening of my life things would
turn out this way Haven’t we had
trouble enough already Without
inventing more

FRANZ
Forgive me

ROSALIA
Let’s say no more

His spirit rises a little at her certainty that she is in the
right and wishes her to lecture him

FRANZ
I know it seems to you I’m doing
the worst to people I wish the
best for But they haven’t given
up on me I don’t see why you
should

ROSALIA
Young people are blind to
everything but their own wishes
They seldom imagine how much those
wishes cost others You’ve thrown

yourself away -- made their
sacrifices vain Let us say no
more

An image flashes through Franz’s mind of the train he dreamed
of -- its power its onrushing force -- carrying them all to
their ruin

FRANZ
Mother your life has been hard
enough I would never do anything
to bring you needless -- pain

ROSALIA
Trust me enough to know the
reasons Why people who have been
loyal to you shouldn’t expect
loyalty in return

FRANZ
You taught me be brave be true

ROSALIA
Not just to yourself Can you
imagine how they are treated --
your wife your children

FANI AND FRANZ 98

Fani draws Franz’s arm around her waist Are they not one

EXT VILLAGE SQUARE 99

The local Policeman his friend approaches Franz on finding
him alone

POLICEMAN
Ive known you since you were a
boy Spare me the pain of
arresting you

Franz seems to nod The Policeman never imagined he might
find himself in this position The war has come home to St
Radegund though many a neighbor has already been called to
service and half a dozen have died

FRANZ ALONE 100

The man who hasn’t given himself to the truth completely
hasnt really given himself -- is that so

FRANZ OS (INTERIOR VOICE)
Mother how I loved you Your
strength Unbroken By sorrow
grief How I wished that I could
lift it from your shoulders

FRANZ WITH THE CHILDREN 101
Franz plays with the children
ROSI
Hold me up -- I can touch the
ceiling
He does this She boasts to her younger sisters that she has
done something they could never achieve They quarrel till

Fani separates them

Husband and wife look at each other

FANI

Come girls Your father’s going

away On -- a journey
GIRLS

Where How long
FRANZ

I don’t know Not very long
GIRLS

Will you bring us something
FRANZ

Yes

NEW ANGLE 102

He looks around the house fearful it might be for the last
time Resie has come to take care of the children

FRANZ
Well go quickly

EXT SQUARE 103
Franz and Fani walk through the village They exchange
courteous greetings with their neighbors who assume that
Franz has put aside his rumored qualms and that he is now
going off like others before him to assume his duties to
the fatherland
FRANZ
(to Fani in a whisper)

I haven’t said anything There’d

be quarrels
EXT WOODS 104

Franz and Fani walk in silence through the woods

EXT SALZACH 105

They cross over the river

FANI
Are you afraid
FRANZ
Are you
EXT TRAIN STATION 106

They embrace each other well out of the sight of others The
sound of an approaching train fills them with dread
EXT PLATFORM 107

The train is gone Fani wanders the platform lost alone

EXT J HOUSE 108

Fani and Resie yoke up the cows They note their neighbors in
the distance

RESIE
They think he went off because he
decided to serve That he is with
the troops

RESIE (CONTD)
(after a pause)
I hate men

POLICEMAN - NEW ANGLE 109
The Policeman bows to Fani
POLICEMAN

Thank you I don’t know how I

would’ve done it
Neighbors tell her how glad they are that Franz has changed
his mind She does nothing to undeceive them Nor does she
tell the children

She looks up sharply at a knock on the door

EXT ENNS BARRACKS (INDUCTION CENTER) 110
Franz approaches the barracks in Enns a city not far from
Radegund A line of conscripts snakes out the front door --
older men along with teenagers

INT ENNS BARRACKS RECEPTION AREA 111

Franz’s heart pounds in his ears He approaches a young

The men have lined up to take their oath to Hitler Franz
gathers his courage says nothing as the others speak

CAPTAIN HERDER
You I didn’t hear you Step out
of the line You will not take the
oath You refuse

Franz nods The Captain looks at him -- puzzled not angry
almost embarrassed

CAPTAIN HERDER (CONT’D)
Do you understand what you are
doing

He motions to a pair of soldiers to take Franz away

INT CORRIDOR 113

Franz is led down a row of cells The prisoners look at him
curious about the nature of his crime

INT CELL 114

Franz is put in a cell with four other prisoners Frenchmen
from the Lorraine Andro Levan Max and Ermin

CELLMATE MAX
We wouldn’t take the oath They
gave us 10 years hard labor

They are taken with Franz’s smile He will find him honest
quiet helpful -- ready to give them his last piece of bread
from the meals they take in their cell and satisfy himself
with a little black coffee

EXT PRISON COURTYARD (LINZENNS) 115

The prisoners are allowed a morning walk Ten times around
the yard

PRISONER
You love your country
(Franz nods)
Why won’t you serve

FRANZ

Doomed

Better than do others’ evil And
die anyway

MONTAGE (LINZENNS PRISON) 116

The routine of the prison Rise at 6 breakfast at 7 clean
the cell a few gymnastics Whispered conversation Tappings
at the wall Notes passed behind the backs of the guards

FRANZ (0S)

Dearest wife Warmest greetings
from my new residence I have 24
hours in this place behind me I
will be here for the duration of
my interrogation So far it hasn’t
been bad There are five of us in
this cell So many foreigners The
food is not bad There is no need
for you to be concerned about my
physical well-being When we
submit ourselves to God’s will
everything turns out for the good
May things come about as He wants
If only they go well for you

Franz sits with his eyes closed The guards taunt him as do
a number of his fellow prisoners (Improvised)

EXT ST R FIELDS - FANI ALONE 117

Fani shears the sheep No one from the village comes forward
to help her She sees them in the distance nods They look
away

At first they assumed that Franz had given up his scruples
gone off to answer his induction notice and serve with the
troops It must be that they begun to learn the truth
4l

Fani cuts the hay and rakes it out in aromatic rows Little
Rosi helps her mother drag a harrow through an uncultivated
field They bend their backs like beasts of burden

INT INTERROGATION ROOM (LINZENNS) 118

Franz is led into a meeting room with a hundred chairs and a
long table He marvels at this world unlike any he has ever
known

CAPTAIN HERDER
(to the guard)
You may leave us alone

He strides back and forth He never looks directly at Franz

CAPTAIN HERDER (CONTD)

The company commander isn’t here
What good do you imagine your
defiance is doing anyone

(no reply)
Do you expect to change the course
of things Do you think the
authorities are aware of you That
your protest will come to their
attention That anyone will know
of it Ever hear you Do you think
it will influence some decision
No one knows what goes on here
Behind these walls What purpose
does it serve

His voice is calm and measured There is no shouting no
abuse Franz is surprised a little pleased

CAPTAIN HERDER (CONTD)
Are you alone wise Do you know
something I don’t Tell me what
that is

(no reply)

Do you think it matters to God Do
you think you matter to him Then
why are you here

He looks out the window waiting for Franz to speak

CAPTAIN HERDER (CONTD)
Your God does nothing Would I
pray to a spider Poor man No
individual bears a responsibility
for all this That responsibility
belongs to one man He stands
alone

FRANZ
I wont follow his evil orders
Does it make no difference whether
this war is just or unjust

CAPTAIN HERDER
Has heaven told you this What
does your priest say Your bishop

Franz must be careful not to compromise them

FRANZ

We can’t simply ask what our
bishop would do We have to ask
what our conscience says to this
It’s hard to find the right path
now when the signposts have been
blown around by the wind Our
spiritual leaders -- are silent

CAPTAIN HERDER
They might have their reasons I
tell you this as someone who is
kindly disposed toward you Do you
judge me

FRANZ

I can’t look into another man’s
heart I judge no one

EXT COURTYARD

Franz is led back to his cell The guards are bored There is

no Gestapo here no SS This is a provincial jail and the

matter is a small one in the great scheme of things

FRANZ OS (INTERIOR VOICE)
I waited No one else seemed
troubled in the same way It
seemed they knew something that I
didn’t

INT CELL
Franz talks with a cellmate Carlo

CARLO
A good war For them to make money
on I’ve seen lots of things since
I was a boy It only gets worse
They leave the poor man behind
This is the big folks’ world

CARLO (CONTD)
When the ship goes down it’s the
boys in the engine room who go

first

FRANZ
What did you do before you got
there

CARLO
A robber age The law is rob or
be robbed

FRANZ

Do you have a family

Carlo shakes his head He has no way of learning the
uncertainty Franz feels Franz is alone in many ways

FRANZ (0S) (CONT’D)
My wife My children Lead me
Tell me what I should do

CARLO
I see no use for the church It’s
left the stage Each man has to
find his way alone

FRANZ
How have you

CARLO

If I had I wouldn’t be here But
it makes me sick to see men get
down on their knees The church is
a whorehouse The whole idea of it
-- loathsome low As if men got
down in the mud to worship They
never get down on their real
knees Myself I bow to nothing

The image of the train which has haunted Franz from the
beginning passes quickly before his mind’s eye The engineer
shovelling coal into the firebox The pistons the
interweaving tracks

CARLO (CONTD)
How can you cast your care on him -
- or make him your hope Look what
happened to him The same will
happen to you

INT PRISON (LINZENNS) - SERIES OF ANGLES 121

Franz goes about his daily routine The prisoners are rounded
up for a walk in the courtyard They empty out their slop
buckets are given bread and beans and a wooden spoon to eat
them with

FRANZ (0S)
(from a letter)

Dearest wife I am once again
grateful for all of the love and
faithfulness and sacrifice that
you have shown me and the whole
family -- and that you are
continuing to show me It will
also be a difficult sacrifice not
to have someone with whom you can
be angry and perhaps not to have
anyone who will hurt you Love
requires it always striving for
more perfection It will become
easier for you At least you know
to whom you can entrust your
hurts

EXT ST R HOUSE 122

Fani helps a poor woman a widow who lives on the outskirts
of St Radegund The widow is grateful to Fani while others
regard her with suspicion

poor for as long as you can
Dont be angry with mother even if
she does not understand

INT PRISON COURTYARD (LINZENNS) 123

should not give testimony to
anyone

FRANZ (0S) (CONTD)
If someone asks you if you agree
with my decision not to fight
only say how it has been most
difficult for you You cannot
lighten things for me

New officers interrogate Franz They try to trap him with
trick questions but still there is no physical abuse if
anything they find a strange curiosity about him

EXT

difficult

EXT ST R FIELDS WELL FOREST ETC 126

FANI (0S)
We could use you here for work
Especially to break in the calf

The calf refuses to be harnessed Fani has to run to catch
it Swaying its head it knocks her to the ground then looks
at her with innocent apologetic eyes

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
Twice it was harnessed to the
manure spreader and pulled it here
and there When there’s no one
else one must think about
everything If only you could come
home to cultivate the oats to
rake the hay

Fani gathers brushwood from the forest She moves though the
dark woods looking for dead limbs

EXT FARM - FANI WITH ROSALIA 127
Fani and Franz’s mother carry water from a stream The well

has run dry Rosalia’s frustration grows when her bucket
spills on the ground

ROSALIA
Now they know

FANI
Who

ROSALIA

The others Everyone Someone must
have told them Your sister

FANI
She would never say anything

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
Our well has run out of water We
have to carry water with buckets
If you could come home to improve

things We don’t trust ourselves
in the well so it still is full
of mud Already we need rain to

cultivate the oats Greetings from
your three little women

The girls play nearby unaware of their grandmothers
mounting displeasure with Fani

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
They say to tell you only about
the good things they are doing Of
course But I would not surprise
you by telling you about their
disobedience

MARIDI
If pappa comes home we wont
fight anymore

FANI

LOISI
When he comes home -- he won’t be

able to get in

FANI (0S)

sends us with gratitude He loves
us He won’t send us more than we
can bear

129 EXT FIELDS OF OATS
Rosalia’s hostility has grown to a settled disposition

ROSALIA
Do you tell him Everything

FANI
Write him yourself

ROSALIA
My hand would tremble I’m afraid
that when he’s gone I’ll hate
him for it I his own mother

FANI (0S)
Today we finished the cultivation
of the oats The calf now walks
with such ease that it can be with
the cows The weather is lovely
and so we have much to do I
remain continually concerned about
you Warm greetings from your
loving wife Fani Greetings too
from mother sister and the
children Be well See you
again

130 EXT ROAD BACK FROM THE FIELDS

Two neighbor women pass Fani on the road

FANI
Why do you look at me that way
FRAU PATE
We know
FANI
What is it What
FRAU PATE
Our husbands fight so you can be

safe

They look at her with cold unforgiving eyes

FRAU PATE (CONTD)
An act of madness A sin against
his family His village

2ND WOMAN
His church

FRAU PATE
You kept it a secret

2ND WOMAN
An uneducated farmer

FRAU PATE
He’ll be forgotten

They leave Fani fighting back her tears

Driving her cart through the main square Fani is treated to
the cold stares of neighbors whose warm greetings she has
been accustomed to

As she gives her grain to Trakl the miller she lowers her
eyes in confusion and shame
INT MILL 133
A water wheel drives the mill Fani watches as the grain is
separated from the chaff

Trakl loads the sacks of milled grain back onto her cart

FANI

But -- You’ve given me back --

more than I gave you

He does not meet her eyes He bows in silence Fani goes
away moved

135 INT CELL 135

Franz calms a cellmate who is trembling and shaking with fear
and despair

FRANZ (0S)
Now my little ones Dear Rosl
Maridl and Loisi Thank you for
praying for me It will bring me
great joy if I am able to see you
again soon I urge you not to
quarrel Also do not lie I
believe the heavenly Father will
bring it about that I shall come
home to you Since this won’t
happen soon Mother must be able
to lock the door at night I shall
come home during the day And dear
wife have you brought in the
straw from the pasture Yesterday
I saw buds on an apricot tree My
three girls will already be
running barefoot and picking
flowers It would be better to
tell them where their father is
than to tell them stories And
dear wife I wish to ask something
of you Would it be possible to
put some pieces of edelweiss in
the next letter A cellmate here
requested that I get him some -- a
young Frenchman condemned to death
a few weeks ago He would like to
send edelweiss to his beloved as a
farewell gift

136 EXT WELL 136

Fani scrapes in the darkness at the bottom of a well Resie
looks down from above They both are covered with mud

FANI (0S)
The well went dry on Thursday We
dug it out Now we need a good
rain At the moment we must carry
our water Here are some violets
though they will be dead by the
time you get them The children
when they see beautiful flowers
immediately want to send them to
their father who will laugh when
he receives them

They carry water home in pails

ROSALIA
(to the sisters)
You should’ve dug it out You
waited

EXT FIELD 137

Strohofer a neighbor gives the sisters a ride in his wagon
When Fani goes to pay him he shakes his head Resie is moved
to tears by this small kindness It seems not everyone in the
village has turned against them

FANI (0S)
Strohofer gave us a ride to
Tittmoning He did not demand
payment and would not accept any
Greetings to you in God most
beloved husband

They cut sedge grass from the banks of the Salzach river

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
Many think things aren’t going
well for you Though I can’t help
you and can send you nothing I
would like to visit you if only
for a few minutes I don’t know
whether I may What do you think

EXT BARN 138
The sisters put up straw

FANI
I tried to get in touch with the
fortress They don’t answer My
husband loves his country They
don’t answer the phone When I can
even get a signal How do you get
their attention Who are they
accountable to You can’t get at
them There’s nobody to connect
the call If you get someone he’s
not the one in charge

Resie has now come to live with Fani to help with the farm
They are more and more cut off from life in the community
Neighbors pass by without exchanging a word eyeing them
coldly

Fani thinks of the fortress -- remote dark and
incomprehensible The place where their fates will be
decided

FANI (CONTD)
They don’t explain Anything Why
should they be in charge Why --
should they run the world Did
they ask him if he would accept
work in a hospital We don’t want
any favors from them Just his
rights

RESIE
How was it when you went

FANI
So strange At first I couldn’t
find anyone

EXT BURG (SAND) 139

Inside the fortress the narrow streets are curiously
deserted There are small buildings here and there the
plaster flaking off the walls The battlements are crumbling
from neglect

Everyone Fani meets is amiable enough but no one seems to
know the name of the official she asks to speak with At last
she arrives at the office of a Major Kiel He sits behind a
desk A corporal in an SS uniform plays Mozart in the next
room

MAJOR KIEL

Here you are Take a seat Tell me
your wishes

(shuffling his papers)
Ah I remember The whole
business Now that you’ve been so
kind as to visit I must tell you
the truth of the matter I see
nothing this department can do
But I will send your papers along
to Linz Let’s see where are
they

His desk is overflowing with papers bundles of them
MAJOR KIEL (CONTD)

There’s always business left
undone Things to put away

MAJOR KIEL (CONTD)
You can be sure your case will be
treated with the greatest
understanding Why don’t we say
that when we’ve given it all our
proper attention we’ll send for
you The Colonel must be
consulted

FANI
May I meet with him

MAJOR KIEL
Ah Madame he can’t meet with
everyone A busy man But phone
Make an appointment

FANI
I’ve tried to My call isn’t
answered

MAJOR KIEL

That surprises me The problem
must be on your end The telephone
works quite well up here It
speeds up our work But there’s no
fixed connection I know And
sometimes these lazy fellows
leave the receiver off the hook

FANI

Then how can I make an

appointment You don’t answer my

letters It took me two days to

get here A difficult journey
INT ADJACENT ROOM 140
The soldier playing the piano has stopped to talk with Fani
Fani feels herself in a labyrinth a soulless world with no
way out
EXT COURTYARD (BURG) 141
As Fani wanders through the courtyard the officials avoid
her eyes

EXT BURG (SAND) - BELL 142

Fani hears a distant bell She looks up towards the fortress
The stone walls stand dark and indifferent

She looks up with aweStrange uncanny remote and cruel
demonically illogical

FRANZ (0S)
I advise you not to visit at this
time Maybe later I still have
not received a trial Most people
think that things are bad for me
here but we get enough to eat
They did not lock us up to make us
fat Things could be worse

A petty obstinate unaccountable bureaucracy of documents
and procedures a hierarchy of fearful men

FRANZ (0S) (CONT’D)
You know dear wife that I do not
engage in this struggle in order
to make my life wonderful As long
as I don’t lose my faith nothing
can be unfortunate Our sadness
will be changed to joy All this
in relation to eternity is less
than half a second

Who are they these men -- this authority that she can never
reach
FLASHBACK - EARLIER IN THEIR LIVES 143

Franz remembers when he rode his motorcycle where he pleased
His was the first motorcycle in the village Everyone came
out to look at him He was a wild one then He played cards
bowled danced He had just come back from working in the
mines full of life and hope It was then that he first met
Fani

FRANZ
Who do you have the next dance
with
FANI
With you -- if you will ask me
FRANZ (0S)

Seeing you again would bring me
joy Yet I advise you to wait a
while Also to buy a pair of
scythes So you will at least have
one sharp blade for reaping

FRANZ (0S) (CONTD)
When I look back and think of all
the good fortune and graces that
have come to us in the seven years
since we were married I see many
things that border on being
miracles If someone were to say
to me there is no God or God has
no love for us and if I were to
believe this I would no longer
understand what has happened to
me He has preserved us He will
not abandon us

EXT CROSSROADS - FANI 144
On her way back to St Radegund Fani sees a pretty young
woman -- she must be in her late teens -- laughing carefree
as Fani herself once was -- innocent free of suffering
FANI (0S)
(to the children)
God knows what we need want

She remembers a neighbor putting a finger to her lips
shushing her

NEIGHBOR (0S)
Watch out

The authorities might hear of her protests She might end up
as her husband has What would become of the children

The villagers ostracize her more from fear than from dislike
or disapproval She remembers telling Franz

FANI
My husband I want to die with you
-- together -- but I have to live -
- for the children

Officials from the fortress stop at the Gasthaus on their
travels Free from the eye of their superiors they drink
flirt with the barmaids strut about

Rosi brings her mother an apple

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
Rosi has set aside a beautiful
apple which I am supposed to send
you if I may The girls went
today to see the pony at the
Schirks

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
Resie was glad to get out of the
house The children are too
playful for her

The girls play with a pony that belongs to some neighbors

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
Loisi said to tell you she wants
you to come home to play

EXT CHURCH (PALM SUNDAY) 145

The villagers carry willow branches decorated with ribbons
fruit and cookies to the church Children singing lead the
way

FANI (0S)
Palm Sunday our little ones went
in the procession with the other
children Each held a willow
branch

Fani sees other women on the arms of their husbands

INT CELL 146

Franz turns in circles in his cell He closes his eyes He
wants to pray but he cannot his anxiety is too great He
continues to pace in torment

FRANZ (0S)
Dear children I’m grateful for
the violets which you sent me I
can see you don’t forget your
father who doesn’t forget you and
would love to be with you
However the heavenly Father wants
to have it otherwise Thank him
that he has sent me a good wife
and you a good mother Always have
love for your mother Obey her
You can’t run outside with bare
feet O my wife I know you fear
for me but my burden is light
When I compare my suffering to
that of other people I see that
mine is the smallest of crosses

Many of the other prisoners suffer in silence with no one to
write home to no one who cares about them

FRANZ (0S) (CONTD)
How are things going with the
haying

The apple that his daughter Rosi sent him rests on a table in

his cell

EXT COURTYARD (LINZENNS)

As Franz walks in the courtyard he looks over the walls at
the buildings on a street across the way There people still
live in some degree of freedom He could join them It would
take but a single word One small act of relenting and he
might see his family again

INT INTERROGATION ROOM (LINZENNS)

The Captain walks in a circle around Franz

CAPTAIN HERDER
You feel no fear at following a
line of conduct which leaves you
in danger of the death penalty

FRANZ
A man worth anything has only one
thing to consider whether he is
acting rightly or wrongly --

CAPTAIN HERDER
Is your God stronger than the
Fiihrer
(Franz does not reply)
Why does He let him rule the
world

FRANZ
That is a mystery

CAPTAIN HERDER

How do you know what is good and
bad Do you know better than I
You seem to think there is a
nobility in this Who is this God
that requires you destroy the life
of your own with that of family
You think he wants your blood in
order to satisfy him Will it get
you on his good side Blood-
drinker

(no reply)

CAPTAIN HERDER (CONTD)

What have you done to him to make
him send you this misfortune

(Franz nods he will not deny it)
Knowing that your Jesus suffered
shouldn’t make you want to suffer
He never sought it out There’s a
difference between the kind of
suffering we can’t avoid and that
we choose You suffer for no
reason

(no reply)
Pride Are you better than the
rest

FRANZ
He doesn’t cause anyone to suffer
He doesn’t tempt anyone We tempt
him

CAPTAIN HERDER
You know his mind He speaks with
Have you seen beyond the

Franz thinks of Hitler Newsreel images of the Fuhrer
untroubled hailed by all

CAPTAIN HERDER (CONTD)
A private revelation Would you
not participate in any war -- or
just this one You have other
plans Is it because war isn’t the
best way to solve our problems

Franz does not answer

CAPTAIN HERDER (CONTD)
You prefer to stay out of fights

FRANZ
No

CAPTAIN HERDER
Is it because youre afraid

FRANZ
I’m afraid -- of the devil

CAPTAIN HERDER
Am I the devil A servant of his
I I don’t feel that way Christ
is dead Forsaken as youll be
He said so himself

CAPTAIN HERDER (CONTD)
You too will say “I thirst”

You love a dead man -- more than
your wife Your children You love
a ghost

FRANZ

You say we should do what the
State wants because other people
are responsible for what we do No
one wants to be accountable for
the crimes done in our name
Responsibility is shifted from one
person to another

CAPTAIN HERDER
Are you mad

FRANZ
You say think of the times we
live in Well those men and women
in olden days who put their lives
at risk because they wouldn’t
carry out Caesar’s orders -- what
do you say of them Did they live
in better times

CAPTAIN HERDER
It’s one thing to take a stand on
a big stage But you are
nowhere You have no power

FRANZ
Enough

CAPTAIN HERDER
We live in a new world now

Night settles on the cell The Captain is still with Franz A
single candle burns in the darkness

CAPTAIN HERDER (CONTD)
Are you afraid of death The end

CU FRANZ and IMAGES OF DEATH (IN HIS MIND’S EYE) 149

Images of death flash through Franz’s mind a shore a veil
a window sill a fence in a pasture an open door in the
jail a stairwell leading down into the darkness a candle
blown out

In his mind’s eye from his memories of St Radegund often
analogies of death present themselves to him a neighbor
laboring at a plough the ploughshare cutting through the
earth heaving it up A sower sowing A harvester bringing
in the sheaves threshing the grain winnowing it out

The Captain listens silent

FRANZ OS
Better to suffer injustice than to
commit it Nothing can harm a good
man in life or after death I
bear them no grudge -- they can’t
hurt me Who can harm us if we
follow our conscience They can
only harm themselves I suspect
this that has happened to me is a
blessing --

Dawn shines through the bars of the window

EXT FIELDS - 2ND UNIT (APRIL) 150

lose hope If we can no longer
celebrate together in the trusted
family circle a joyful Easter in

full confidence the day when the
eternal morning breaks Then no
one from our family will be
missing Then we can rejoice
together Forever

EXT ST R FARM 151

Easter has come The children pick flowers and roll Easter
eggs (According to this custom the children roll hard-
boiled eggs on a flat surface the winner is the one whose
egg goes the farthest)

Fani cleans the house She embroiders towels and the hems of
the girls’ dresses A clock ticks on the wall

FRANZ (0S)
I am in good health I hope all of
you are too What fine weather
The fresh green of the grass is
good for a person Someone with
freedom may not notice it

Outside the villagers pass by with fearful glances at the
house of shame and doom

FRANZ (0S) (CONTD)
Spring has come You can again
pick flowers and roll eggs Thank
Rosl for the apple which she sent
me I’ve saved it

Rosl does a curtsey when her mother gives her this news

completely dried up It is too bad
you aren’t here to arrange

things are getting worse She was
inconsolable Her husband goes

serious You -- with your

155 EXT FIELDS 155

Fresh green shoots of wheat and barley have begun to appear
in the fields

Fani and Resie cut hay A sow eyes them warily

FANI (0S)

We finished with the haying
Already it is so warm one can see
the green shoots coming up
Tomorrow the sow will be
butchered I am happy about this
She has become more and more
difficult She would not eat the

FANI (0S)
Ganshanger cut off four fingers in
the feed grinder He was on leave

police showed up He is now under
suspicion for self-mutilation

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
People are speaking much about it
all Poor man -- whether he did it
to himself or not

The police sneer at Ganshdnger roughly It is as though they
felt obliged to make a show of their skepticism

Fani is out planting potatoes
FRAU SCHUSTER
May I put some plants in your

FANI
Of course

She looks at the poor widow stooped over them on her knees
in the mud A widow

Fani under her breath
FANI
Spare him 0 please Tell me what
I should do
She can tell Franz nothing of her anxieties her doubts
though sometimes she cannot help herself
INT PRISON (LINZENNS) 162
Nor does Franz tell Fani of his ill-treatment not only from
the guards but also by many of his fellow prisoners insults
he greets with courtesy humility
FRANZ (0S)
Girls your Mother will scold you
if you roll around too much in the
grass Your father greets you
warmly Do not forget me

Popular tunes -- sentimental songs -- play on the guards’
radio

The apple Franz’s daughter sent him sits uneaten as though
he wished to keep it as a remembrance of his home

INT CELL - BLACKBIRDS 163

Dawn breaks outside his window The birds sing

FRANZ (0S)

Dear wife I still can’t say how
my future will unfold What comes
next is seldom better And
still now begins the month of
May the most beautiful month
Nature does not notice the sorrow
that has come over the people

A blackbird appears on the window ledge

FRANZ (0S) (CONTD)
At dawn we can hear blackbirds
singing loudly outside our
windows They seem to have more
freedom and to know more of peace

and happiness -- though they are
only unreasoning animals -- than
we humans do -- we who have the

gift of understanding

(over the blackbird’s song)
It should not sadden us if we must
do without many things and give up
what our hearts desire when we may
be rewarded a thousandfold in
eternity Let our hearts yearn for
everlasting gifts How does the
grain look One loves his home
Greetings to our neighbors

Two guards enter Franz’s cell

Without a word of explanation they shackle him hand and
foot then drag him roughly down the corridor outside to a
waiting car

Where is eternity now

164 EXT LINZ - TRAIN STATION 164

Franz asks an officer who is accompanying him for permission
to write a letter The officer a Captain nods Kneeling
down by the locomotive Franz jots down a few words

FRANZ (0S)
Dearest wife I leave for Berlin
at 1013 AM Have no concerns
about me

The locomotive steams and hisses It stands like an icon of
overwhelming force

165 INTEXT MOVING TRAIN 165

Franz sits next to the Captain a polite man who seems only
to want to be done with his distasteful duty

FRANZ (0S)
This departure came as a surprise
I had no time even to say goodbye
to my companions The officer
accompanying me is a pleasant man
My decision remains the same
During the interrogations they
wanted me to take it all back --
deny everything

166 STOCK FOOTAGE - TRAIN TO BERLIN 166

The train crashes through the countryside The tracks weave
in and out

FRANZ (0S)
If things in Berlin should go bad
for me have no concern Now I
must close It is almost time to
leave Greetings to Mother to

again

It is night when they enter Berlin Franz turns to the
Captain

FRANZ (CONTD)
Why are they bringing me here To
the Capital

The Captain shrugs

167 STOCK FOOTAGE - POVS ON BERLIN ”SYMPHONY OF A CITY” 167

Franz marvels at the vastness of the great city He has never
before been outside his corner of Austria

FRANZ (0S)
I arrived safely on May 4 If it
had been a vacation it would have
been a lovely ride The farms and
villages we travelled through were
beautiful Though I am still
removed from you have no heavy
heart because of me You know
under whose protection I stand I
trust

EXT TEGEL PRISON COURTYARD 168

Franz bids farewell to the Captain They have arrived at
Tegel prison on the outskirts of Berlin

FRANZ
I hope that I haven’t caused you
any inconvenience

CAPTAIN
No I was coming up in any case
Good luck

Now suddenly things change

GUARD
You When I say frog you jump

The guards treat the prisoners roughly especially during
their first days Franz’s silence in response to their blows
only infuriates them the more

FRANZ (0S)
On the way I caught a glimpse of
the vastness of the city All goes
well for me here It is a little
different than back home but one
need not suffer here and many
things are better

INT ADMISSIONS CELL TEGEL 169

The guards shove Franz into a cell He looks around There is
a bed that folds up during the day a small table with a
glass on it A towel a jug of water In the corner a toilet
bucket There is also a small wardrobe and a lamp that can
only be switched on from outside in the hall that goes on
and off without warning

The blankets on the bed have a foul smell He throws them
into the corner

FRANZ (0S)
I have a small closet of my own
Very nice If one dismisses an

occasional harsh word one’s heart
remains at peace

He sets his chair beneath the window He looks out Rain is
falling He can see nothing of the streets beyond

GUARD
You No looking out the window
Get down

FRANZ (0S)

Here we may write one short letter
only every four weeks But we can
get mail as often as it comes
Packages of food are not allowed

INT CELLBLOCK TEGEL 170

The prisoners are called out of their cells Each wears a
black jacket and black trousers with yellow stripes running
down the sides

As soon as his door is unlocked each prisoner steps forward
and announces his crime

FRANZ
Jagerstatter Undermining morale

EXT YARD TEGEL 171

The inmates are allowed half an hour on the yard They must
keep a distance from each other and speak not a word

FRANZ (0S)
If I had any idea that I would be
taken from Linz without a trial I
would have invited you there for a
visit A trip to Berlin would now
be too hard If it is God’s will
we shall have a reunion with each
other again in this world If not
then we hope for it in the next
world where the visiting time
will be somewhat longer than
fifteen to thirty minutes

TEGEL PRISON LIFE - MONTAGE WITH FANI OS 172
Franz’s life at Tegel falls into a routine

A guard points Franz out to the others

GUARD
No one is to speak to him

A prisoner weeps in the next cell No one takes any notice

He cannot see how things are run in the building He can only
guess from the incessant shouting of the warders He is told
nothing From morning till night he hears their foul oaths
Their ill-treatment of those being held for investigation
penetrate his cell Everyone is treated as a criminal There
is no mercy for the innocent or merely accused or those
locked up for trivial offenses

GUARD (CONTD)
If you complain of being struck --
it is of course strictly
forbidden -- the boss will never
believe you Only me I can always
find a colleague who will testify
for me Under oath

The tone is set by those warders who behave in the most evil
and brutal way The whole cellblock resounds with their
abuse The quieter more fair-minded guards are nauseated by
it But they tend to be the subordinates and exercise no
real influence

PRISONER MARTIN
We ask for work Games are
forbidden Even chess You can’t
make up your own board Don’t try

The prisoners suffer from a lack of occupation especially
those in solitary confinement The only work that is given
them is folding paper into envelopes for soldiers at the
front They often sit in the dark for hours at a time because
the staff are too lazy to switch on the cell lights

When they put out the little flags designed to get a guard’s
attention the guards shout angrily at them and their light
is not switched on

FANI (0S)
My dear husband Trust in the
heart If the spirit that sustains
us didn’t sustain the world
itself then everything would be
out of kilter Why would it
abandon us How could it

They are not allowed to lie on their beds before “the Last
Post” so they have to spend the prior hours sitting in the
dark

When late at night the air raids come there are no
shelters for the prisoners Franz listens to the anguished
cries of the men trapped in their cells The thud of the
bombs

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
The pain will only make us better
and bind us closer together For
that I’m grateful -- best of
friends my man

Why should there not be for us
too a secret power unknown to us
steering our fate toward the best -—
- a power beneficent consoling
Why would we despair

Their days last fourteen hours He spends three walking up
and down in the cell It is strange to him that the peace and
composure that were supporting him can sometimes vanish
suddenly Then he finds himself trembling inwardly with fear
and doubt It feels to him like an invasion from outside as
if some evil power were trying to rob him of what is most
necessary to his sanity

FANI (0S) (CONT’D)
Whatever you think best is what I
too want Even if you believe a
total separation between us is
what we really must have I won’t
take it wrongly The bond will go
on and on to all eternity -- and
life is short But -- because life
is short should we forfeit it
Oh tell me where will we
find one another again Darling
my beloved soul Where can I find
peace Let me face my duties --
forget about myself even if it
should be ever so difficult

WARDER STEIN
(to Franz)
It’s a job like any other No
talking with the others No I can
let you break the rules or I can
join you there No Better a live
rat than a dead lion

When he walks in the yard he gets pleasure from watching the
ants on a small ant-hill from the bees in the linden trees
from the swifts and swallows that dart between the buildings
chattering gaily

It strikes him that nature carries on its simple open life
without interruption It makes him feel sentimental towards
the world though not toward the flies that flit about his
cell they only seem eager for him to die so they can carry
on their business unopposed
oe

He stops to look at the remains of a barn swallow nest that
some wretch has knocked down and left on the ground

FANI (0S)

Love will keep us close when we
walk where we can’t see Feel it
with me The highest love finds no
peace on earth

To seek it would be wonderful --
to die with each other Together
But we have duties in this world

He has no knife or fork He eats his meals with a spoon

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
Pain will only make us better --
draw us closer to each other

There are so many things that he could never tell his wife --
that she would not understand -- that would alarm and sicken
her So many times when the world seems nauseating and
burdensome to him when he wonders who he really is the man
who writhes under these experiences and cries inwardly to
heaven or the man who seems composed and cheerful -- in
control of himself -- and who allows a few others to admire
him for it The man who plays a part

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
How I love this pain now When it
leaves me when everything in me
goes numb how I long for it
again Only my tears can give me
joy What is this love of ours

At such times the evening sky the birds the clouds do not
know him Nor the two lovers whose distant laughter he
hears Nor his fellow sufferers asleep or awake turning on
their beds shifting in their chains turning and twisting
unable to find warmth or comfort Only the tower clock seems
aware of him as it strikes the hour asking him what can it
matter whether one day turns into another

I thank you for all the happiness
you have bestowed on me Through
you I’ve received more than I
could ever have expected I hope
that I’ve been worthy of it I
would like to give you peace But
I owe you an account of all I
feel Fear overcomes me I know
that it should not But our love
is too deep for me to be able to
deceive you

Hee KO

ee ee ee

It is so hard to keep a strong heart Not to surrender to
sorrow and despair To hold your head high when everything
seems to be going wrong

FANI (0S) (CONT’D)
Never doubt my love It will be
yours for all eternity Who else
can I tell my heart to -- my one
my only friend

EXT TEGEL COURTYARD - THE SHARP JUDGE - FRANZS POV 173

Franz sees a man in black evening dress -- in tails anda
stovepipe hat He looks as though he were on his way to a
wedding or a ball

FRANZ
Who is that

FELLOW PRISONER
(whispering)
The Sharp Judge He cuts off your
head

The Sharp Judge looks at them Steadily At one point he
seems to smile A strange figure of death the last person
that a condemned man would see

FANI (0S)
This won’t have been the last time
I see you I can’t think that Let
me hope Why we suffer I don’t
understand Will we know some day
I become so downhearted so
quickly Afterwards I don’t know
how to help myself For all
eternity I will be true to you
Best of friends May I yet be able
to give you joy I’1l see you
again No one will take this
certainty from me

Franz cannot tell Fani but gradually he has been sinking
into a spiritual darkness At the depth of that darkness he
again meets Rogowski the soldier from his training days now
a fellow prisoner but unlike Franz himself as bright and
optimistic as ever

They greet each other warmly though Rogowski does not seem
quite to remember who Franz is

Over the next several days Franz observes how this
extraordinarily happy man never complains but treats
everyone with an unfailing good cheer including the guards
Franz marvels at him

Rogowski notices his low spirits and urges him not to
grieve “The dawn is coming” he says “Trouble lasts an
hour” OR “Imitate the sundial only count the pleasant
days” Franz sees how he loves every man equally the Nazis
his fellow prisoners the cooks a dog and Franz himself

174 EXT COURTYARD - FIRE 174

A siren is wailing A fire has broken out in one of the
buildings As the guards rush to put it out Franz talks with
a prisoner a few years older than he is a revolutionary from
Serbia

CELLMATE DIMO
Have the meek inherited the earth
How far we are from having our
daily bread
(walls)
Dont let your life be a show No
one’s watching Just these walls

We sense his cellmate’s doubts are those which torment Franz
himself He does not say a word in contradiction

A loathsome world Not a trace of
mercy in their decrees Not a
trace of love or charity Their
shamelessness knows no limit Why
give your life for them

175 EXT ST R FIELDS 175
Fani works in the fields

FANI (0S)
Greetings beloved husband The
weather is warm Almost no day
passes without rain The grass and
the clover are beautiful the
grain grown up I hope no hail
will destroy it though we fear
the British with their firebombs
They say the planes are flying
over the countryside to destroy
our crops It would be terrible
We would have nothing to eat

Fani’s wagon gets stuck in the mud Some women from the
village neighbors passing by look at her coldly They make
no move to help She is now ostracized in St Radegund with
notable exceptions

EXT FANI AND ROSALIA WITH LANTERNS - NIGHT 176

Fani and Franz’s mother go out at night in search of two
calves that have escaped from the barn

FANI (0S)
We had a scare on Thursday night
We saw to our shock that the two
yearling calves were no longer in
the barn Nowhere to be seen or
heard You can imagine how upset
your mother and I were We set out
to look for them -- found them at
last at the Strohofers It is
terrifying to have to search for
animals at night I am always in
pain for you I keep you in my
love You’re so far away I send
you many kisses Mother can no
longer sharpen the scythe No one
can as well as you One can go to
Lang but he is always in a hurry

Rosalia and Resie take turns trying to hammer the scythe
blade into sharpness The banging works on Fani’s nerves

EXT FOREST (ST R OUTSKIRTS) 177

Fani and Resie gather wood from the forest Rosalia helps as
she is able The girls obey their mother more readily now as
though doing so might help to bring their father back home

FANI (0S)
During this week we were in the
forest Together we cut down the
brushwood The children cannot
understand why you are away for so
long They pray for you and are
well-behaved

(buying pigs)

I got some piglets from Mossbauer
Four weeks old I held off for a
time because they were expensive
Now I have paid 100 for the pair
Not bad right For the children I
bought young rabbits 2 marks
each

FANI (0S) (CONTD)
The children are having great fun
with them We can breed them and
make a profit
(driving calves out of the orchard)
The calves are cute But I must
sell one of them soon They eat
too much They have already
devoured everything in the
orchard The clover too If only
you could be home dear husband
Yet many suffer greater blows
(apples in the heights of a tree
Fani strikes them with a pole)
We still have some apples which
you have always enjoyed eating I
do not have much of an appetite
because you cannot be here and
must suffer from hunger With
greetings from your wife

FANI TRYING TO SELL HER PRODUCE 178
Fani has put a bright face on things for Franz’s benefit
When she goes to sell her produce the villagers shake their
heads They will not buy from her

How will she support the children When winter comes what
then

INT TEGEL PRISON VISITORS ROOM 179

Franz is led into the presence of a lawyer a handsome man
somewhat older that himself

FELDMAN
Friedrich Feldman I’ve been
appointed by the court -- to be

your defense attorney

Feldman smiles cordially and takes some papers out of his
briefcase

FELDMAN (CONT’D)
We must make an effort to answer
these charges I understand that
you have refused service in the
Wehrmacht -- though you once
trained with them as a motorcycle
driver I believe As I
understand your resistance is
specifically to serving in combat

FELDMAN (CONT’D)
But I believe if you were to

accept medical service -- work as
an orderly in a hospital that
sort of thing -- they would

probably drop these charges

FRANZ
Would I be required to swear
loyalty to Hitler

FELDMAN
Words No one takes that sort of
thing seriously -- But yes

He leaves off He cannot be sure who might be listening

FRANZ
I cant
FELDMAN
Why not
FRANZ
It hurts my heart My mind
FELDMAN
Ive spoken in confidence with a
member of the court I think -- we

could come to an understanding In
a hospital you might do some real
good

Feldman waits for Franz to answer He does not

FELDMAN (CONT’D)
You’re a stubborn man See here
Im going to leave this paper with
you Keep it with you Sign and
youll go free

He shakes Franz’s hand and leaves

INT TEGEL INTERROGATION ROOM

A man in dark civilian dress interrogates Franz who has
idea who this stranger is or where he comes from

MAJOR SCHLEGEL
What you’re doing is wrong Admit
it We can move on

MAJOR SCHLEGEL (CONTD)
We can lessen the
consequencesGiven the state of
the world other people are making
the same mistake They feel
confused overwhelmed sick You
aren’t to blame You aren’t the
cause of all the trouble in the
world

He moves closer to Franz careful to maintain eye contact
with him allowing him no chance to speak or when he does
raising his voice above Franz’s own or talking over him

MAJOR SCHLEGEL (CONT’D)
I see how you look at me But I
dont believe in anything I get
by
(walking behind Franz)
I believe in what I own What I
can touch Feel I hate death

He peels an orange He points to the paper that would release
Franz from service in the military and the officials
themselves from a growing discomfort

MAJOR SCHLEGEL (CONTD)
Sign -- and youll go free

FRANZ
I am free Already

MAJOR SCHLEGEL
Strange freedom No my friend I
can walk out that door Into the
street I am free Not you

He sees that Franz will not relent and yet is assailed with
fear and doubt

MAJOR SCHLEGEL (CONT’D)
This is what happens when you put
honor above everything What for
Will you be more innocent than
everyone else We’re soaked in
blood The whole earth is

FRANZ
Yes -- it is awful

MAJOR SCHLEGEL
Do I have any obligations I’m
obliged to do only what serves my
interests I was once like you I
learned pretty quick

MAJOR SCHLEGEL (CONTD)
(he claps his hands)
You won’t change the world You
have no power The Fiihrer has
power

FRANZ
What kind

MAJOR SCHLEGEL

Enough to determine if you live or
die

(no reply)
Ill bury you my friend Ill be
walking around playing with my
children when you’re in the
grave Gone to land no one has
come back from You remember what
Achilles said -- glorious Achilles
-- when Odysseus met him in the
underworld Odysseus told him that
no man had been more blessed than
he And Achilles said “Don’t try
to reconcile me to dying I’d
rather be another man’s slave a
poor peasant without land and be
alive up on the earth than lord
of all the lifeless dead Give me
news of my son instead” That’s
what he said I’d rather be a
slave in the sunlight than a hero
down here A shadow A shade

He shakes his head A hard-necked peasant No changing his
mind

MAJOR SCHLEGEL (CONTD)
No more family Children
Sunlight No pretty music
Nothing Night

Night settles on Tegel Cries resound through the cellblock
The heat is oppressive

AIR RAIDS - TEGEL - NIGHT 181
Tonight again there are air raids As the sound of the

bombers grows louder there are cries of fear from the
prisoners locked in their cells

INT FRANZS CELL - NIGHT

It is during a raid that Franz receives a visit from Fr
Heinrich Kreutzberg the Tegel chaplain The crunch of
explosions can be heard in the distance

FR KREUTZBERG

You aren’t responsible for their
actions You have no basis on
which to reach a judgement as to
the justice or injustice of this
war Your only responsibility is
to meet your obligations to your
family Your people

FRANZ
I don’t see things as you do
Father We can’t remain silent in
the face of evil We have to
confront it

FR KREUTZBERG
How The Church can never make
demands of its members that might
alienate great numbers of them --
or provoke retaliation from the
State

FRANZ
I don’t want to take the slightest
part in this war

Franz had expected consolation from the priest a man of his

own faith

FR KREUTZBERG
I suppose you prove there’s -- an
examination That the exam can be
taken But who knows of this exam
Who can be expected to answer it

Overhead the light falters then goes out

Franz’s children come to him in a dream They hold out their

hands imploring him silently One opens the door of his

cell show him the way out the empty corridor a stairway

beyond it

Then he sees behind them a man in a Nazi uniform his face

wrapped in a cloth so that his eyes cannot be seen or
anything of his expression

183 LATER - DAWN (24 MAY 1943) 183
At dawn Franz is dragged out of his cell into the corridor

FRANZ (0S)
I continue to find my situation
quite satisfactory Do not worry
my wife It could be worse I am
still alone in my cell Almost
daily we have half an hour to move
about freely One can work in his
cell as much as he likes ---
making envelopes And I can still
pray for you Here I can make a
retreat

184 EXT COURTYARD 184

Franz is led to a car in the courtyard below He has no idea
where he is going

Two guards drive him to the Reich’s Military Tribunal in
Witzleben Street (Charlottenburg) He gazes out the window at
others going about their daily lives

FRANZ (0S)
May 24 I appeared before the
Reich’s Military Tribunal for
interrogation It was a long ride
by car The Tribunal is in Berlin
Tegel a little outside the city

The linden trees are in bloom

186 WITZLEBEN STREET BUILDING - STAIRS HALLWAYS ETC 186

Franz is led through the hallways of the Tribunal His hands
are bound in chains

FRANZ OS
Hopefully you’ve had more rain
there than we have here Otherwise
it will be disastrous for the
fruit

Stairways lead up towards and opaque skylight

INT REICH’S MILITARY TRIBUNAL 187

Franz is made to sit down on a chair in the middle of a
large drafty hall

The Court Martial convenes The First Judge Werner Leuben
two military officers a prosecutor a clerk and Franz’s
defense attorney Feldman Banners with swastikas hang behind
them Judge Lueben opens the hearing

JUDGE LUEBEN
Heil Hitler

Franz trembles at the name The charges are read out Against
them we hear Franz addressing Fani as though in a
continuation of his letter

FRANZ (0S)
Be at peace forgive each other

After giving the personal details of the defendant the
Prosecutor reviews the indictment Franz marvels at the
strange hat Judge Lueben wears He looks around at the other
people in the room wondering what their lives are like

Advocacy

No one shows much interest in the defendant much less any
trace of compassion

When at the end Franz is called upon to speak in his
defense he says nothing

Judge Leuben calls the members of the court into another room
for a short consultation It seems they are uncomfortable
with the situation that is being forced on them They would
be glad if Franz were ready to accept service as a medic It
would relieve their consciences of a burden they never asked
for

INT ROOM ADJACENT TO THE COURT 188

The Judge steps into the room where Franz is held Feldman
showing discretion steps away The Judge indicates to
Franz’s guards that he would like to be left alone

JUDGE LUEBEN
What are you doing my fine
fellow Would you accept service
as a medic You wouldn’t have to
take up arms

Franz does not reply

JUDGE LUEBEN (CONT’D)
My son was in the Army He went in
when they called him He had to
suffer He died in Russia In the
snow He had a conscience Are you
proud of your virtue Afraid of
your conscience Has it made a
coward of you

Do you imagine that anything you
do will change the course of this
war That anyone outside this
court ever hear of you No one
will be changed The world will go
on as before You’ll vanish

JUDGE LUEBEN (CONT’D)
Drop away Like a stone in the
sea If a man can’t benefit the
world by his death how can he
decide to sacrifice his life

Youre the guilty one Not I I
didn’t make the world the way it
is It makes no sense to will
more than is possible at any
particular moment

Life’s hard enough as it is
Youll change nobody’s mind Your
actions may even have the opposite
effect of what you intend Someone
else will take your place

We want to save you You have
nothing more to say You know
what it means

FRANZ
I stand by what I’ve said

Franz says it in a trembling voice

JUDGE LUEBEN
You’1l have saved no one -- and
damned yourself The truth is
it’s you not I who pronounce the
sentence You the judge

Arent you tired of the whole
business Isn’t this a self-
inflicted torture I suspect you
have some false belief in the
virtues of misery suffering

Lueben sees that he has gotten nowhere And now it is he who
seems to tremble inwardly aware that he is going to incur an
inescapable guilt in convicting a good man

JUDGE LUEBEN (CONTD)
Do you judge me

FRANZ
No It’s not for me to make your
life harder for you I don’t judge
you and say he is wicked I am
right I don’t know everything

FRANZ (CONTD)
A man may do wrong and not be
able to get out of it -- get his
life clear Maybe he would like to
go back and can’t That must be a
bitter thing But I have that
feeling inside me that I can’t do
what I believe is wrong That’s
all

FRANZ
Why would I say it if I didn’t
mean it

I could set you free

HITLER - STOCK IMAGES - FRANZ IN HIS CELL 193

Images of Hitler half-seen flash through Franz’s mind How
does such a man exist But Franz did not create him What
business does he have standing against him -- a murderer
totally unaware of his existence and whom he can do nothing
to stop

there She looks around in wonder as she and Furthauer are
led down a corridor to a visiting room

She sees the other prisoners She has brought some food for
Franz but she is told she will not be allowed to give it to
him

She is left to sit in the visiting room for half an hour

Presently a truck pulls up the courtyard She goes to the
window and looks down When the truck comes to a stop the
back gate falls open Some soldiers jump out and form a
circle Then Franz in chains is shoved out so roughly that
he falls to the ground

EXT COURTYARD 205

Franz looks up sharply as he hears his wife’s cry He had no
idea that she would be visiting him He looks frantically
about him It is as though her voice had come to him from
another world

INT VISITING ROOM 206

Franz’s chains have been removed He is taken to the visiting
room where he finds his wife Fiirthauer and his defense
attorney Feldman

Franz is overcome with joy He has long since reconciled
himself to the fact that he might never see her again Fani
throws herself into his arms One of the guards pulls her
away

Franz listens in silence as Fani and Furthauer advised by
Feldman urge him to sign a statement saying he will agree to
serve in the Army (Improvised)

you not abandon this senseless

in Franz that he has attempted to hide from her

(to Feldman)
What will they gain by shooting
him

FELDMAN
Tell your husband not me

FANI
Didnt he tell you that he would
accept being assigned to the
medical corps

FELDMAN
We begged him to do it

She turns to Franz Did he prefer that she not know of this

opportunity to save his life -- has he rejected it

FURTHAUER
The charges would be dropped I’m
sure if you just change your
stand I beg you to The war may
soon be over You might never have
to face a situation that would
call on you to do what you oppose

Franz does not seem to hear overjoyed to see his wife again
She gives up any effort to change his decision She sees that
it would make no difference he has already made up his mind

FRANZ
You came

FURTHAUER
Franz you must Don’t you see
what’s coming Take the oath

FRANZ
Is this why they let you come

FURTHAUER
God doesn’t care what you say
Only what’s in your heart Say the
oath and think what you like

FURTHAUER (CONTD)
Haven’t you done as much as he
could ever want

FRANZ
Who are you to lecture me on my
duty Why have you come here -- to
distress me and my wife Leave us

in peace

The guards end the meeting It has been just twenty minutes
Fiirthauer gives Franz his blessing Franz gives Fani a few
pieces of chocolate for the children

Tenderly Franz takes Fani in his arms The Guards look at
each other

FRANZ (CONTD)
Tell me you understand Tell me
you forgive me So I can die

FANI
Pretend -- pretend I do No But I
love you I always will Whatever
you do Whatever comes Even

The Guards pull her away

FANI (CONTD)
Let me go Take your hands off me

GUARD
Do what I say

207 EXT TRAIN STATION - MUSIC 207

Fani and Fiirthauer board the train back to Austria Music
comes in

FANI (0S)
I’d meant to tell you so many
stories about life at home I
forgot so much You yourself were
annoyed -- but the pastor meant
well Don’t lose heart Warm
greetings to you from your loving
wife Fani who is concerned about
you And many kisses Be well See
you again

208 INT FRANZ’S CELL - MUSIC 208

Franz paces back and forth in fear and trembling

FRANZ 0S (INTERIOR VOICE)
I wanted to give you all I had
You never asked for anything It
hurt that I had so little to give
Sunlight in you Around you Have
I been so good to you Have you
missed life Can you miss it the
way you miss a train You
forgiving me Where are you now

209 ABOARD TRAIN - MUSIC 209

Fani sits on the train with Fiirthauer It hasn’t yet left the
station Some children are playing in a vacant lot nearby

FURTHAUER
(haunted shaken)
I hope I didn’t upset him I did

FANI
You always said that if we lived a
good life wed be happy It seems
that doing so might bring you
suffering instead Sorrow

FURTHAUER

(after a silence)
It is terrible to represent
Christianity as I do and not
really to be a Christian Not yet
I know what one is But if you set
it forth in all its truth people
would revolt against it This
collar doesn’t protect me from
hypocrisy We’ve made the church
into the theater Me an actor
The world will have no benefit
from my having lived I will just
have helped it go on deceiving
itself The world wants to be
deceived

He looks at Fani in despair

210 MONTAGE 210

Over Fani’s return home we hear Franz’s letter in response
to her visit

FRANZ (0S)
You made a great sacrifice by
coming here

94

FRANZ (0S) (CONTD)
It would have spared you much pain
and expense if my defense attorney
had not written to you I still
have not received a statement that
my death sentence has been
confirmed To be sure I received
great joy from our reunion but
not from the fact that you had to
make such a great sacrifice It
brought me pain that we could
speak so briefly I am not angry
with the pastor I ask his
forgiveness for all my unnecessary
words to him I wanted to spare
you the suffering that youve
borne for me

Franz offers his food to another inmate a man who seems
never to have expected mercy from another human being He
receives Franz’s portion with suspicion and distrust
convinced that Franz is a fool

GUARD
You gave him your food

FRANZ (0S)
Dear wife do you believe that all
would go well for me if I were to
tell a lie in order to prolong my
life How our final hours will be
we don’t know Or what struggles
we must pass through

Back in Radegund Fani reads Franz’s letter out loud to

Resie who though she believes all this was unnecessary yet

must admit

RESIE
He loves you I love him for it

INT FRANZ’S CELL
The Guard finds Franz alone in his cell

GUARD

I’m just trying to be a father
Raise a son Work hard Up early
You think you’re better than I am
Cant call in sick on Monday No
holidays Do my duty So my family
can sleep

(slapping Franz’s face)
Turn the other cheek

GUARD (CONTD)
I stand by my brothers and
sisters Proudly When my land’s
in danger You offend me

FRANZ
Why

The Guard steps on Franz’s hand

GUARD
How does that feel You think I
care You think that if you look
at me that way I’ll stop Do you
Who can stop me

FRANZ
No one

GUARD

I can do what I like with you
Youre nothing to me Nobody would
know Care Nobody lift a hand to
stop me I have power Putting on
airs No one hears my little
friend No one cares Nobody’s
minding the store

The guard attacks him knocks him to the ground and kicks
him in the mouth

GUARD (CONTD)
The Sharp Judge waits for you
They take off your shoes socks
Tie your hands behind your back
Then no wife No children You
offend me What do you say now
Are you the wisest man in the
world Do your betters know less
A peasant

He strikes him again stung that Franz will not plead with
him

GUARD (CONTD)

It’s good manners to scream To
beg To say “Mercy Father I’1l
pray for your good health” Say
it “Please stop I worship you
The ground you walk on” Don’t
look around There’s no God here
Inside these walls Where Where
do you see him I’m your God

FRANZ (0S)
(to Fani)
So much can change So much goes
differently from what we would

like
GUARD
Do you forgive me
FRANZ
Yes
GUARD

How dare you
He strikes Franz in the eye

GUARD (CONTD)
Didn’t think Id do that did you

FRANZ
I’m not afraid of you

He strikes Franz again

GUARD
Does anyone see Are you a man
(holding Franz to the wall)
Your God doesn’t -- hear you He’s
put you in our hands Alone
You’re alone

FRANZ
No

GUARD
You look in my eyes when you talk
to me Bad manners Look down

Franz will die with no expectation that his sacrifice will
make the slightest difference to anyone For his neighbors
the refusal of army service is an act of folly a sin against
his family his community and even his church which has
called on no one to refuse military service

He knows that beyond his family and community his death
will go entirely unnoticed have no impact on the Nazi
movement or hasten the end of the war

He will be forgotten Who might remember or care about the
vain gesture of an uneducated farmer One more name among the
millions whom the Nazis have executed

IMAGES OF DEATH FEAR 212

Images of death crowd into his mind the open cell door (he

could walk out) a stairwell leading down from the cellblock
into the darkness the hay-scythe cutting through the grass
and last of all the train from his dream of years ago

FRANZ (0S)
Today the sentence was confirmed

INT CELL 213
Fr Kreutzberg sits across from him

KREUTZBERG
Others have done the same Last
year

Franz brightens at this news Kreutzberg speak softly to
avoid being overheard

KREUTZBERG (CONT’D)
I used to think that if you loved
others rightly all would go well
for you Did it go well for
Christ Now I see if you want
happy days don’t get involved
with him It brings trouble

He looks at Franz in awe

INT TEGEL PRISON 214

The Prosecutor has come out to Tegel to read Franz the
document confirming his death sentence He explains that the
next day the judgment will be carried out Kreutzberg and a
doctor are also present

PROSECUTOR LARS (0S)
The criminal nature of his action
will not be suspended due to his
beliefs (Section 48 MStGB) The
accused is completely normal no
sign that would

Later Fr Kreutzberg nods at the letter still lying on the
desk Franz has only to sign it

INT FRANZ’S CELL 215

Franz spends his last night on earth overwhelmed with anguish
and doubt

In the morning two guards come to fetch him His shoes and
socks are taken off his hands bound behind his back All is
just as he was told it would be

PROSECUTOR LARS (0S)
Sufficiently informed about the
duties of a German soldier
tenanciously refuses to fulfill
his patriotic duty as a soldier
during Germany’s struggle for
survival

EXT TEGEL COURTYARD (9 AUGUST 1943) 216

The prisoners look down in silence as Franz is led to the
that will take him to the execution site at Brandenburg-
Gorden

Several other condemned men strangers crowd into the back
with him

INT J HOUSE ST R 217

Fani has received a last letter from Franz She reads it to
the children

FRANZ (0S)
Dearest wife And all my loved
ones This morning at
approximately 530 I had to get
dressed immediately for a car was
waiting I went with other
condemned prisoners on the ride
from Tegel to Brandenburg We do
not know what will happen to us
At noon someone told me that the
verdict would be confirmed at 200
pm and that it would be fully
enacted at 400 pm

INT MOVING CAR 218

The condemned ride in silence One of them a 19-year-old
boy looks at Franz as though to ask “Will I not escape”

219 EXT BRANDENBURG COURTYARD AND GARAGE 219

They descend from the truck at Brandenburg prison At the end
of a courtyard stands an old garage It is here that the
executions take place

Briefly in the distance the Sharp Judge appears -- dressed
like a dandy in tails and a top hat and smoking a cigarette

The condemned are given writing materials

JOSEF
Who do I write to My family’s
gone

All take courage from Franz’s example

FRANZ (0S)
I want to write all of you a few
words of farewell I am deeply
grateful for everything that you
have done for me in my life -- for
all the love and sacrifices which
you have shown me And I ask you
once again to forgive me for
everything that I have made you
suffer I ask everyone else
whom I at some time have pained
and hurt to forgive me
Especially the pastor with my
words as he visited with me It
was not possible for me to free
you dearest wife and mother from
the sorrows that you have suffered
for me

220 INT J HOUSE (ST R) 220
Fani reads Franz’s letter to the children

FANI (0S)
Give my warm greetings to my dear
children Do not forget me in your
prayers And may we see each other
soon Greetings to all of you
before his last journey from your
husband son and father son-in-
law and brother-in-law Heart and
my heart be one bound for time
and eternity

Rosi the eldest girl sees her mother in distress What is
she doing hiding her face that way

The younger sisters play oblivious as with a solemn awe
Rosi gets her first glimpse of human suffering and wonders
what may lie ahead for her and for them all

EXT COURTYARD 221

Fr Kreutzberg offers to read to Franz but he shakes his
head preferring to sit in silence

The pastor marvels at how Franz remains at peace through his
final hours calm prepared No word of fear or complaint
passes his lips

His eyes shine with a strange joy

EXT GARAGE (EXECUTION SITE) 222

The condemned are led to the outbuilding that in the past was
used as a garage There are still a few old tires lying
around wrenches the rusted parts of a disassembled
transmission

The men -- 18 of them -- stand in a long row several meters
from each other In front of the execution chamber there is a
bench where three may sit at a time

GUARD
They call it the Devil’s Bench

The humor goes unappreciated As each man stands up to be led
into the garage Fr Kreutzberg comes to him gives him a
cross to kiss and prays with him

The condemned man is led by two Sergeants into the room
There is a small table on it a cross between two burning
candles Behind the table stands the Prosecutor a clerk of
the court a doctor and the priest

Two executioners step up behind the condemned man his
personal details are read out once again with the judgment
against him

Across the whole room hangs a black curtain It is just as
they described it to Franz In front of the curtain the
Sharp Judge The Prosecutor calls out

PROSECUTOR LARS
Sharp Judge fulfill your office

The curtain rises The scaffold becomes visible The
guillotine rises above it Then the curtain closes

It happens that Franz finds himself next to Josef who
trembling turns his back to the instrument looks up into
Franz’s face and thanks him

JOSEF
Im not afraid of anything while
Im with you Not if they make it
quick

FRANZ
They will

They speak as if they were alone Eye to eye heart to heart
at one point hand in hand Strangers who have come together
on life’s dark highway to make their way home together

JOSEF
What do you see

He is struck by the strange look in Franz’s eyes

JOSEF (CONTD)
You comfort me I’m so ignorant
May I kiss you Has the moment
come

FRANZ
Yes

He kisses Franz on the cheek The young man’s hand does not
tremble There is a bright constancy in his face He goes
first and is gone
FRANZ (0S) (CONT’D)
Be strong my wife I’1l wait for
you

He steps forward

223 INT LIVING ROOM J HOUSE ST R 223

Fani looks up as the clock strikes four

224 ROSALIA 224

Franz’s mother regrets her harshness towards her daughter-in-
law Now she has no one else

ROSALIA
Forgive me You have been good to
me and to my son And I havent
been good to you

She kisses Fani’s hands
FRANZ (0S)
Mother Children
RESIE 225
Fani throws herself into her sister’s arms

FANI
I don’t understand

FADE TO

EXT ST R CHURCH 226
Against the Prosecutor’s order that there be nothing done to
honor Franz’s memory a neighbor goes into the church and
grasping a rope that hangs down from the ceiling in a small
act of defiance begins to ring the bell as Franz once did
The Mayor looks up from a chair in his garden Unmoved
indifferent The Policeman weeps alone

EXT FIELDS 227
The tolling of the bell reaches out through the fields
gathering the villagers into a single body

EXT FORTRESS (BURG) 228

The fortress stands in silence

FADE TO

EXT RECTORY ST R SQUARE 229

Fani speaks with Fr Furthauer outside the rectory conscious
of the glances of two villagers in the distance

FANI
I’ve lost a good husband A good
father -- for my children Our

marriage was one of the happiest
in the parish People envied us

FANI (CONTD)
Our beautiful union was lost Already
I look forward -- to where no war can
ever separate us again With great
respect from the depths of my heart
I wish you good for all youve done --
for my dear husband

She turns and goes away

EXT FIELD - FANI AND RESIE GLEANING

Fani and Resie work their way through a field of barley
cutting the stalks with a sickle and laying them out in
windrows

FANI
I thought you just had to be good
Wasn’t he Franz

Her sister takes her hand

FANI (CONTD)
A time will come when we’1l know
what all this is for why
there’s all this suffering And
therell be no mysteries Well
know why we live

Far away they hear singing The neighbors are working in
their fields

The life of the land goes on
