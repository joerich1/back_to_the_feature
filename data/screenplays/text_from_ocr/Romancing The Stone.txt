outside He cocks his shotgun

Flies BUZZ hides hanging from the beams something SIMMERS in
the pot over the fire TUMBLING RIVER WATERS are heard in the
distance All else is still It is 1875

A cigarette dangles from Grogans lips

GROGAN

pause)
It seemed endless I was sure

the winter of ‘Seventy-four’

Shotgun aimed at her breast he takes a step inside

Angelina surreptitiously slides a boot dagger from its sheath

GROGAN

His eyes Gart about the room lock onto the saidlebags on the
bunk He moves that way

With one graceful movement Angelina grabs the daggers ti
and flips it undernand A silver flash streaks through the
air and Grogan falls back out the door deader than yesterday

Angelina throws ona doeskin poncho and snatches up the
saddlebags

That was the end of Grogan the
man who killed my father raped
and murdered my sister burned

into a taxi an ominous figure in a dark overcoat and avaitor
shades

But Joans eyes see something else A YOUNG COUPLE obviously
very much in love walking arm in arm bundled up against the
cold New York winter

ANGLE ON JOAN 18

The wistful look on her face tells us how much Joan wishes
to be arm in arm and the rueful shake of her head indicates
how little hope she has that that wish will come true

Joan lets the curtain fall back (Near her is a photograph
of herself and her older sister Elaine Elaine standing in
the g big smile on her face while Joan behind is almost
cowering afraid of the camera)

Joan again peeks out the window then with renewed
determination she returns to her typewriter

A cold blustery day Snow on the ground Kites fly up in

erystal gold jade -- hanging from a bar -- interspersed
with tiny bell-ladened wind shimes

With a nostalgic smile Joan fingers the locket Jack gave

Up ahead she sees some tough punks sitting along a bench
legs stretched out harassing passersby Joan pauses --
