TONI ERDMANN

Written by Maren Ade
EXT - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY

A house with a wild garden on a tranquil suburban street It sits there quietly The
only movement appears to come from behind a window We hear a delivery truck
pull up Its sliding door opens and closes A MAILMAN walks into shot carrying a
package and searches for the doorbell He finds it amongst some ivy and rings
WINFRIED a man in his mid-60s with wavy gray hair an unkempt beard and a pair
of colorful reading glasses opens the door

MAILMAN
Good morning Package

The mailman starts typing something on a modern electronic signature device

WINFRIED
Wait a moment No idea what my brother’s been
ordering again

Winfried steps a couple of meters into the house and calls to someone The mailman
waits professionally

WINFRIED (0S) (CONT’D)
Toni Did you order something

He returns to the mailman

WINFRIED (CONTD)

(quietly)
My brother just got released from prison He
does whatever he wants

MAILMAN
Oh dear

WINFRIED
He was locked up for mail bombs Yesterday he
ate a whole can of dog food OK just a moment
please

Winfried disappears again leaving the mailman standing there He diligently carries
on holding the package

WINFRIED (0S) (CONT’D)
(suddenly shouting)
Toni get your ass out of the hammock right now

TONI (0S)
I’m still having breakfast
WINFRIED (0S)
Keep this up and Ill throw you out Did you
order something from Orion again

TONI (0S)
No I didn’t Don’t be so mean to me

Aman appears Apart from a few distinctive teeth he looks uncannily similar to
Winfried He’s wearing a black bathrobe and dark sunglasses He voice has changed
and he mumbles when he speaks The mailman quickly hands him the package

TONI (CONT’D)
What my brother said about me isn’t true I’ve
never ordered any erotic products

The mailman holds the device out so Toni can sign it

MAILMAN
I don’t care what’s in it

TONI
It’s better that way

Toni signs using capital letters A pair of handcuffs dangles from his wrist and the
mailman notices them with bemusement He briefly puts his ear to the package

TONI (CONT’D)
Thanks Now I’m really looking forward to
defusing it

In the background by the garden fence LUKAS appears He’s a pale teenager with tight-fitting black jeans and drooping shoulders Winfried quickly takes off his
sunglasses and removes a set of false teeth from his mouth and sticks them in his
pocket He can’t help but laugh

WINFRIED
Hey Lukas

Winfried looks at the mailman who also laughs with bewilderment It’s not clear
whether Winfried’s act might have convinced him for a moment after all Lukas still
stands some distance away unsure whether he’s allowed to come closer

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
(to mailman)
No offense meant They were both me It was
obvious right

Winfried fishes out a five-euro bill and gives the mailman a quick pat on the
shoulder An electronic beeping sound emanates from Winfried’s body
WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Don’t worry That’s just my blood pressure
monitor

Winfried finally takes the package from the mailman

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Youre the bravest one yet
(to Lukas)
Ill be right there

The mailman leaves and Winfried also disappears

INT - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - GARDEN - DAY

In the living room Winfried hastily takes off his bathrobe Several plastic objects
and cables are attached to his body They look like an explosive belt He buttons his
shirt and puts down the package The device on his body is still beeping An old dog
(WILLI) hauls himself up off the floor and lies down again at a safe distance The
dog’s breathing is labored and fluid rattles in his lungs

WINFRIED
Come in

Lukas enters the living room Winfried opens the package and pulls out a new spray
gun attachment for his garden hose

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Our lesson is tomorrow right

LUKAS
Yes but I I wanted to tell you that um Well I
want to quit taking piano lessons

For a moment neither speaks

WINFRIED
OK

LUKAS
I just don’t have enough time anymore

WINFRIED
We saw this coming a bit right

LUKAS
Yes
WINFRIED
And what do I do with the piano now I bought it
just for you

Lukas freezes for a moment

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Just kidding But you have to tell your mother
I’m not doing it

Lukas nods The dog can be heard wheezing in the garden

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
That’s just the dog

Winfried walks into the garden to fetch his beer He bends down to Willi again He
quickly takes a plate of sausage from the table and places it front of the dog Willi
turns his head away Winfried grabs his beer and walks back to Lukas

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Do you drink beer already

LUKAS
Ah yeah sure

WINFRIED
My internet’s acting up That ball was there
again

Lukas bends over the laptop on the table

LUKAS
Yeah it’s frozen

INT - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Winfried and Lukas still sit in the living room in front of the laptop sharing a beer
Winfried’s face is painted white with dark circles around his eyes that break out into
jagged points Face paints lie on the table On the computer screen we see pictures of
people painted like the death

LUKAS
I’d put some blood there too

WINFRIED
OK
Winfried looks into a small hand mirror and applies a little more blood to the corner
of his mouth

LUKAS
That looks cool Like the Joker

Winfried looks into his little hand mirror

EXT - OUTSIDE WINFRIED’S HOUSE - DAY

Lukas leaves Winfried’s house carrying a dog pillow and a grocery bag He pauses
and waits for Winfried Winfried emerges from the house with Willi in his arms his
face painted like a zombie large black circles around his eyes a black “grin” around
his mouth and a smear of fake blood He closes the front door and follows Lukas
down the walkway In the distance an elderly couple walks towards Winfried and
looks at him with bemusement

EXT - ANNEGRET’S HOUSE - GARDEN - TERRACE - DAY

Winfried walks through a landscaped garden He slowly pulls Willi up some steps
while also lugging the basket and shopping bags Inside the house ANNEGRET a
very old woman sits in her living room in front of the TV Winfried gives a warning
knock on the glass veranda doors and holds a “Frau im Spiegel - Woman in the
Mirror” magazine in front of his face Its cover depicts German TV host Thomas
Gottschalk Winfried slowly lowers the magazine Annegret his mother is not at all
shocked to see his painted face She slowly pushes her walking frame to the door

INT - ANNEGRET’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Annegret greets Willi who drags himself inside with great effort and lies down ona
Persian rug

ANNEGRET
Why don’t you put him to sleep He’s only
suffering

WINFRIED

I’m not putting you to sleep either

Annegret deliberately ignores Winfried’s costume She begins imperiously
examining the groceries and checking them against her shopping list It takes her a
long time to do anything but she doesn’t want help We hear the sound of a radio
coming from the bedroom

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Is Mrs Radica still here
Annegret doesn’t answer She sullenly inspects a couple of ready-made tartes
flambées

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
I brought you these tartes flambées They’re
really good You just have to warm them up

ANNEGRET
You eat these

WINFRIED
Sometimes

ANNEGRET
Then take them with you

Winfried’s gaze drifts to the table which Annegret has already set for two people

ANNEGRET (CONTD)
Now sit down

WINFRIED
I have to go soon

Winfried quickly sits down on the edge of a corner bench and puts a slice of sausage
onto a piece of bread

ANNEGRET
The Dombrechts are cutting your hedges
tomorrow Youre blocking all their sun

Winfried has to stifle his anger

WINFRIED
That’s fine My new hose attachment has a range
of 30 meters so Ill be able to shoot right into
their living room

ANNEGRET
There’s no need to joke about it

Winfried’s blood pressure monitor beeps quietly and inflates on his upper arm

WINFRIED
I’m glad that thing’s taking a measurement now
It ascertains which topics upset me most Then
Dombrowski can tell me precisely what I need to
eliminate from my life
ANNEGRET
Youll soon be rid of me

Winfried takes another bite of his sandwich and looks at her

WINFRIED
I might bring Ines tomorrow Apparently she’s
traveling through

ANNEGRET
Oh she’s here

Winfried’s mother’s face briefly brightens up at the good news

WINFRIED
Yeah I have to go

Annegret shrugs Winfried peels himself out of the corner He walks into a back
room past the bathroom which MRS RADICA a domestic maid of Eastern European
appearance is cleaning

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Don’t be frightened

MRS RADICA
Oh my

Mrs Radica laughs Winfried gives her a friendly handshake Annegret follows him
with her walking frame so she can keep an eye on what he’s doing Winfried takes a
hat from a closet

WINFRIED
Can I borrow this

Annegret shrugs in agreement

ANNEGRET
And what’s with the getup

WINFRIED
So you are interested after all I’ve taken ona
side job in an old people’s home 50 euros per
death Most of them wont fight back

Annegret shakes her head Winfried leans down towards Willi who has hauled
himself after him

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Thanks for taking him I’ll just pick him up later
INT - SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

Winfried waits with a large group of JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS in the
entrance area of a school They’re standing outside a door leading to the auditorium
The children all have their faces painted like Death and they’re making an effort to
stand quietly Winfried has a guitar slung around him A COLLEAGUE is helping him
look after the children She laughs quietly

COLLEAGUE
It is a little macabre

WINFRIED
We can’t change it now

From the auditorium someone can be indistinctly heard bringing their speech to a
close then the large audience applauds The students prematurely push forward
into a darkened backstage area A few of them are carrying instruments They
collide with the art club as it leaves the stage with a huge long artwork that requires
several students to carry it A crush ensues One of the “young Deaths” gets pushed
over and fights back

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Slowly slowly Arne get up

From outside we hear as the music club’s performance is announced

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
OK guys now focus Everyone’s sad

The students let their shoulders droop and amble very sadly onto the stage
Winfried checks that every last student is there A few members of the audience
burst out laughing Winfried is the last person to take to the stage He gives a
command and the students make a voodoo-like racket then chant

STUDENTS
(chanting in unison)
Were dead sad that youre leaving Mr
Dudinger

In the packed auditorium people laugh bemusedly A MANN in the front row clearly
the person being bid farewell isn’t sure how to take it Winfried gives another
command and starts playing a tune on his guitar A few students join in on their
instruments The students start singing an adapted version of Hannes Wader’s song
“Day to Day” We look into their faces which are full of concentration
INT - SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Winfried walks hurriedly through the empty high school holding his school key in
his hand

INT - WINFRIED’S CAR - STREET BY RENATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Winfried has parked his VW Passat in front of a fancy new-build house in a hillside
location He glances into the mirror and looks for a tissue but he can’t find one He
puts on his hat and gets out of the car

EXTINT - RENATE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Winfried fishes a bottle of red wine from a canvas grocery bag With his colorful
reading glasses hanging around his neck he’s now only a half-Death At the front
door he hitches up his pants and takes a breath He plucks up the courage to ring
the bell RENATE opens the door

RENATE
My God what’s this

WINFRIED
Sorry I have an upset stomach

She lets him in GERHARD appears in the background alarmed by Renate’s scream

GERHARD

WINFRIED

GERHARD
Of course I have a gun

RENATE

WINFRIED

GERHARD

Winfried greets the other guests OLIVER mid-30s clearly Gerhard’s son his
pregnant girlfriend BABETTE whom Winfried hasn’t met before and BARBEL an
old friend of Renate’s Winfried whips out his false teeth from his jacket pocket and
puts them in his mouth

with

Winfried notices some gifts lying on the table

WINFRIED
Whose birthday is it

RENATE

Winfried sits back in surprise

WINFRIED CONRADI
Oh come on You should’ve let me know that

A woman (INES) approaches the patio door talking on her cellphone She rolls her
eyes by way of apology for the phone call She is wearing a crisp shirt and blazer
Winfried briefly reaches towards Gerhard’s neck and pretends to strangle him Ines
smiles

BARBEL

Barbel nods knowingly but doesn’t dare ask any more questions
OLIVER

Ines has finished her phone call and enters the room She comes over to say hello to

They hug awkwardly because of Winfried’s face-paint Winfried rubs her neck

WINFRIED
Hello spaghetti How’s it going

RENATE
(to Ines)

Winfried looks at his hand He had white face paint on it when he rubbed her neck

WINFRIED

BARBEL
Gall soap

Renate tries to take off Ines’ blazer

INES
Mom leave it I have a whole suitcase full of

INES
It’s just a tiny spot

Winfried’s blood pressure monitor starts to inflate

INES (CONT’D)
What was that

WINFRIED
Just my blood pressure monitor

INES
What’s wrong with you

WINFRIED
Nothing Routine

INES
And am I supposed to get your outfit

WINFRIED
We were joking around with the school band
Saying goodbye to our principal

INES
That doesn’t explain anything but whatever
WINFRIED
Ill wash this stuff off now

Winfried leaves

INT - RENATE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Winfried exits the bathroom now without his face paint He’s just finishing a phone
call He still looks ill however because he hasn’t been able to wash off all of the
paint He spots Renate in the kitchen and walks over to her

INT - RENATE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Winfried leans on the countertop next to Renate

WINFRIED
I’m afraid I have to leave soon Willi’s at my
mother’s place

RENATE
And how’s he doing

WINFRIED
Quite good Sleeps a lot

He pulls a dental retainer box from his jacket pocket takes out the false teeth and
shows them to Renate

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
They’re almost broken again here Can you fix
them again with that professional glue

RENATE
Sure Youre a private patient so I’ll do anything

WINFRIED
Yeah I don’t dare go to the doctor any more
Everyone wants to treat me right away

RENATE
That thing is so annoying when youre sleeping
Weve had it too Is there a specific reason

WINFRIED
Nothing but they’re giving me a blood thinner
now
RENATE
Gerhard takes that too

She gestures at a pretty pillbox with compartments for each day of the week

RENATE
You guys should talk sometime

Winfried puts in the false teeth

WINFRIED
Could you make them permanent too I find my
crowns so boring

Renate laughs She looks into the darkened garden in which Ines’ outline is visible

RENATE
All she does is talk on the phone

WINFRIED
We mustve done something wrong

EXT - RENATE’S HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

Winfried walks through the garden searching He’s put his jacket on again The
garden is empty

EXT - IN FRONT OF RENATE’S HOUSE - DAY

Winfried walks around the house and spies Ines next to the garages For a moment
it’s as if she’s hiding from her family Her shoulders are hunched and she’s smoking
She holds her Blackberry in one hand Winfried is just a few meters away from her
when Renate calls to him from the house

RENATE
(indistinctly from far away)
Come back inside

INES
I’m still on the phone

Ines thinks Renate was calling to her Only then does she see Winfried standing next
to her She reflexively lifts the phone and now that she has it at her ear she carries
on acting
INES (CONT’D)
(into phone)
Yeah good And what else did he say OK that’s
no bad thing
(quietly to Winfried)
I’m almost done Dad

Winfried waits Ines acts out the phone call so convincingly that he suddenly
wonders whether there really might be someone on the other end

INES (CONT’D)
All the same Id like to get back in touch
tomorrow But I’m glad we talked Yes you have
a nice evening too

She hangs up

WINFRIED
Everything OK

INES
A bit of stress Are you leaving already

WINFRIED
I’m afraid I have to Do you want to come to
Grandma’s for breakfast tomorrow

INES
I’m flying at ten already Did you tell her I’m
here
Winfried shakes his head
WINFRIED

It doesn’t matter Ill call Inge I’ve hired someone
to be a substitute daughter anyway

INES
Aha And what kind of stuff does she do

WINFRIED
Different things Sometimes I just want her to
bake a cake Sometimes she helps me to cut my
toenails The kinds of things daughters normally
do
INES
So she can call you on your birthday too Then I
don’t have to worry about it

WINFRIED
It was only a joke

Renate approaches the two of them carrying a wrapped up piece of cake and the hat
which Winfried had forgotten By way of a goodbye Winfried simply takes Ines’
hand firmly in his

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
I don’t know if I still have make-up anywhere

INES
It’s a shame this was so brief Well have a really
long Skype soon

Her tone is particularly tender and it almost sounds like she’s talking to a small
child

WINFRIED
Right sure My Skype’s working again

RENATE
Yeah she shouldn’t work so much

Renate pinches Ines’ cheek

WINFRIED
She’s doing great

EXT - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT

Winfried walks into his garden He’s fetched a blanket and a bowl of ice cubes Willi
lies on the lawn in the garden The dog isn’t well Winfried lies down very close to
him ona pillow taken from a chair It’s a bright windy night He pulls the blanket
over himself and shuffles even closer to his dog who is now pretty much only
exhaling

WINFRIED
(quietly)
My Willi don’t be frightened Don’t be
frightened Are you my dear Willisuch a lovely
Willi

As he speaks he gives the dog two ice cubes to lick They clink quietly Willi tries to
stand up but falls to one side Winfried again shuffles closer to him
EXT - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - GARDEN - DAWN

The sun is rising when Winfried wakes up on the lawn Willi is no longer lying next
to him Winfried sits up He spots Will a few meters away under a bush He kneels
down next to him and touches him The dog is dead

INT - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - KITCHEN OR LIVING ROOM - DAY

Winfried has gone into his house He stands for a moment in the kitchen He reaches

for the coffee filters He looks out of the window at his dog as if he’s waiting for Willi
to get up again after all But the fur under the bush is so motionless that it suddenly

seems fake Only the bush above it moves

INT - BUCHAREST OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

Winfried sits in the modern reception area of an office building He’s wearing
sunglasses and holding a newspaper He peers at the entrance doors Now and
again businesspeople enter the lobby and employees leave the building The
elevator doors opposite him open so Winfried lifts up the newspaper An unknown
man in a suit steps out Winfried lowers his newspaper again He begins to rip a
small hole in the paper He looks at the modern illuminated reception desk Behind
it two female RECEPTIONISTS with their hair styled in tall up-dos appear to be
talking about him One of them walks over to him in her high-heeled shoes

RECEPTIONIST
Are you sure you don’t want us to call someone

She speaks English with an Eastern European accent

WINFRIED
No thank you

The receptionist nods and walks back to her desk where she whispers to her
colleague It becomes clear that Winfried has already been sitting here for quite
some time He’s raised the women’s suspicions Winfried folds up his newspaper At
that moment a group of businesspeople (including HENNEBERG DASCALU and
ANCA) enters the building Winfried spots Ines among them Quick as a flash he
puts in the false teeth lifts up the newspaper and walks along next to the group
conspicuous in his effort to be inconspicuous Ines looks straight at him and for a
moment she seems to freeze But then she walks on and continues her conversation
with a colleague who turns around to face her Winfried watches her and the group
disappears into an elevator beyond a staff-only barrier Winfried walks onwards
out of the building Outside he removes the false teeth and sunglasses For a
moment he stands there perplexed unsure whether Ines saw him or not
EXT - IN FRONT OF BUCHAREST OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Winfried walks outside onto the street New modern glass buildings contrast with
dilapidated blocks from the Ceausescu era

Winfried looks around and is about to continue when suddenly a young Romanian
woman wearing a business suit stops him

ANCA
(in English)
Excuse me I am sorry Are you Mr Conradi
WINFRIED
(mixing German and English)
Ja Yes
ANCA

Hello Anca Pavelescu I am the assistant of Ms
Conradi One minute please

Anca puts her cellphone to her ear and speaks to someone

ANCA (CONT’D)
Yes I got him

She hands the phone to Winfried

WINFRIED
Hello I’m sorry Just a flying visit No you don’t
have to come here Ill book myself into a hotel
somewhere Yeah nothing no No really
nothing’s wrong

He listens and relents

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
OK fine Yes OK See you later

He hands the phone back to Anca
WINFRIED (CONT’D)
(in English)
I shall follow you

Anca looks at him in surprise
EXT - BUCHAREST OFFICE BUILDING - ROOF TERRACE - DAY

Winfried sits with Anca on the office building’s modern roof terrace She has laid out
a few tourist brochures and a city map which she’s marking with crosses

ANCA
And here is the Radisson also one of the five-star
hotels in town The restaurant is excellent And
there is also a nice cigar lounge for business
meetings or drinks in the evening

WINFRIED
I am only the father Just holidays
(in German)
I don’t really look the part

Anca’s cellphone rings She listens with intense concentration Winfried looks
around at the terrace A few people in suits are sitting and smoking

ANCA
She asks whether you would like to accompany
her to a reception of the American embassy this
evening

WINFRIED
Was that she

ANCA
(in German)
Yes she’s still in the meeting

WINFRIED
(mixing German and English)
OK When she will

For a moment neither of them knows what to talk about

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
(in German)
And how is my daughter as a boss
(in English)
As your chief

Anca isn’t sure how to respond

ANCA
Yes she’s very honest and she gives me a lot of
feedback about my performance
WINFRIED
(stammering in English)
“Performance” This means this describes your
job

ANCA
(in German)
Performance means my work in general in
meetings with the team dealing with clients

WINFRIED
And what’s most important when dealing with
clients

ANCA

That no concept makes sense if the client doesn’t
want it It’s an art to tell the client what he
actually wants

WINFRIED
I’m sure my daughter’s good at that

INT - CAR - HOTEL FORECOURT - EVENING

Winfried sits on the back seat of a spacious car being driven towards the entrance to
a hotel The driver BOGDAN is speaking to someone via a cellphone earpiece

BOGDAN
(into earpiece)
Weare here
(to Winfried)
She is coming

WINFRIED
Thank you

He pats Bogdan on the shoulder Outside Ines hurries out of the hotel and climbs
into the back seat of the car next to Winfried She kisses him on both cheeks

INES
(in German)
Wow what a long day right

WINFRIED
Yeah well sure you have to work

INES
Yes
WINFRIED
I’ve really invaded you here huh

INES
How long were you actually sitting there

WINFRIED
Three hours I wasn’t even sure youd recognized
me

INES
Yes I did but that was the entire Romanian
board of Dacoil How was everything with Anca

WINFRIED
They were all terribly nice to me

Winfried nods towards Bogdan

WINFRIED
The driver too

Ines nods and smiles tensely

INES CONRADI
So listen concerning this event tonight It’s a
business reception given by the American
Embassy Therell be speeches appetizers small
talk and that’s it

Ines looks at her cellphone and rejects an incoming call

WINFRIED
Great Can I go like this

He’s wearing dark-colored jeans a shirt and walking shoes Ines tries to gloss over
the problem

INES
Yeah that’s OK

WINFRIED
There’s a great football match today too If
Bogdan drops me somewhere Ill have a beer

INES
But I’ve already arranged this now
Winfried quickly takes his false teeth from his jacket pocket and puts them in his
mouth

WINFRIED
I just wasn’t sure whether it’s really OK for you
and the ambassador

INES
Are you interested now or not

He takes the teeth out again She looks at the entrance Other people are already
going inside

WINFRIED
Of course I think it’s amazing that youre taking
me with you I’ve never been inside an embassy

before

INES
Thats a hotel

WINFRIED
Oh right

INES

Just one last thing After the reception if there’s
a chance to have a drink with the CEO
Henneberg our client I have to go alone OK I’m
fighting right now to get our contract extended

WINFRIED
Yeah of course No concept makes sense without
the client

INES

You can say youre my father but maybe that
youre tired because you’ve done so much
sightseeing or something

WINFRIED
But I also don’t mind if you tell them I’m your
Grandma

Ines and Winfried get out of the car
INT - HOTEL LOBBY - STAIRCASE - EVENING

Ines and Winfried enter the lobby of a large communist-era hotel Winfried looks
around with interest Ines walks purposefully to the table where the guest list is and
procures two wristbands Guests hurry up a staircase Ines realizes that the
speeches have already begun She glances quickly at her phone Then she and
Winfried walk up a grand communist-era staircase towards a room in which a
speech is already being held

INT - HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

Ines and Winfried slip into the ballroom which is full of people Bar tables are lit in
the colors of the US flag People are clapping and Ines joins in without knowing
what was just being said

US AMBASSADOR
But this is still not the answer to this simple and
serious question Why Romania And as an
ambassador in this country one must have a
good answer to that And I have one Romania
offers significant opportunities to American
businesses with products services or
technologies that either meet growing private
demand or contribute to the country’s
development priorities

Ines looks around discreetly and once again claps along distractedly with everyone
else Most of the guests are businesspeople of various nationalities The Ambassador
says a few words in Romanian and then brings his speech to a close

US AMBASSADOR (CONT’D)
Ladies and gentlemen the buffet is open

INT - HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

The speech is over and the guests move towards the buffet Ines looks around and
eyes a group of businesspeople Winfried looks at a man he thinks he recognizes

WINFRIED
Hey that guy looks like Tiriac

Ines looks half-heartedly towards the man in question

INES
Yeah maybe Could you grab us something from
the buffet
WINFRIED
OK

Ines watches as Winfried walks to the buffet She’s glad to have him occupied She
edges towards the businesspeople (VERMILLARD DASCALU) She shrewdly waits
until an opportunity presents itself then homes in on Henneberg a man aged
around 60 and shakes his hand

INES
Our third time today finally Good evening

HENNEBERG
Yes good evening

INES
That was a fascinating speech

HENNEBERG
Yes were not where we want to be yet but
Romania has really shown great economic
strength in overcoming the crisis

Henneberg glances at the other people lining up to speak to him

INES
I looked at our business case again And I’m
optimistic that well be able to make a well-
founded statement on Monday

Without really having listened Henneberg turns and gestures at a pretty Russian-
looking woman (NATALJA) aged around 40

HENNEBERG
Natalja here is your specialist I’m sure Ms
Conradi can help you

NATALJA
So nice to meet you

Ines doesn’t know what this is about but nonetheless she’s pleased that she’s been
drawn in so quickly

HENNEBERG
She needs to do some shopping tomorrow
(to Natalja)
Ms Conradi works in Bucharest for how long

INES
It’s been almost a year now You keep me busy
HENNEBERG
So I guess you can ask her any shopping
question

The two women shake hands Henneberg turns away to a new far more interesting
conversational partner - MR MYERS an American

NATALJA

I’m sorry for this am sure you are busy but
INES

No it’s OK
NATALJA

We have this wedding in Moscow this weekend
And I still need some presents

Ines is still looking at Henneberg who has now been accosted by Dascalu

INES
I don’t do too much shopping here myself but
there are several big malls Plus there is an area
with exclusive shops depends on what you
need

NATALJA
The mall is OK I have only two hours tomorrow
I also need children’s stuff cosmetics

In the background Winfried reappears carrying two plates piled with food He puts
them down on a table next to Henneberg

INES
Why don’t you give me your number and Ill
scout for the best place and text you

The two women begin to swap their numbers The others say goodbye to
Henneberg the executive He’s used to having people line up to speak to him so he
turns to Winfried assuming that he’s next

HENNEBERG
Good evening

WINFRIED
Good evening I’m just the father

Winfried nods towards Ines
HENNEBERG
I see

The two women are still talking

INES
(to Natalja)
I have been to Moscow only once but I really
loved it I was so impressed by the Bolshoi
Theater

NATALJA
Oh yes it is a remarkable place

Ines keeps an eye on her father while she continues to listen to Natalja

HENNEBERG
(to Winfried)
Are you visiting

WINFRIED
Yes A totally spontaneous decision I’ve never
been to Romania before

HENNEBERG
Then you just had a good introduction from the
Ambassador

Their conversation comes to an amicable halt

WINFRIED
I’m actually here to negotiate with her She’s
hardly at home anymore so I hired someone to
be a substitute daughter A really nice young
woman Now it’s just the question of who pays
her

Henneberg can’t help but laugh Ines is straining to hear what her father’s saying
whilst also trying to politely focus on Natalja

HENNEBERG
That’s a modern solution And is the other
daughter better than her

WINFRIED
The cakes are better and she cuts my toenails

Again the executive can’t help but laugh Winfried gestures towards Natalja
WINFRIED (CONT’D)
But she’s not your daughter right

Ines freezes It was obviously a joke The executive grins and shakes his head but
then firmly says his goodbyes and turns to someone else Natalja joins him Winfried
and Ines are left by themselves Winfried gives Ines her plate which is full of small
appetizers Ines says nothing and for a moment she seems despondent

INES
He’s the CEO I told you about He’s a really
important contact for me

WINFRIED
OK Criticism accepted
(referring to the food)
I didn’t know what you like

A woman (TATJANA) interrupts Ines from behind She’s passing by struggling to
keep up with a group of Chinese businesspeople

TATJANA
I’m freaking out with these Chinese wannabe
investors Are you coming on Monday

INES
Yes but text me where

TATJANA
Da Vinci 9 pm

(quietly)
I don’t know what to talk about

INES
Just talk about food That always works

TATJANA
Like “What’s your favorite Wan-Tan” I know
nothing about Chinese food

EXT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

The reception guests are slowly leaving Winfried arrives carrying his and Ines’
jackets Ines is still looking over at the group surrounding Henneberg (Vermillard
Dascalu Myers) They’re already making their way towards the exit She and
Winfried also walk towards it Suddenly Henneberg is behind them and addresses
Winfried
HENNEBERG
(in English)
Want to join us for a drink

He catches himself and switches to German

HENNEBERG (CONT’D)
Were going for a drink if you’d like to join us
What was your name again

WINFRIED
Winfried

Henneberg also looks at Ines but the question seems to be aimed mostly at
Winfried Natalja joins him and she seems to be keen for Ines to come along too

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Thank you that’s terribly nice of you but I’m too
tired I’ve done too much today Sightseeing

INES
(in English)
But Id love to grab a drink Where are you
going

Because it’s an international group she’s switched into English

HENNEBERG
I think your father would like you to join him

Henneberg says it so bluntly that it almost sounds like he’s withdrawing the
invitation

INES
(to Winfried)
Come on one more drink

The situation becomes uncertain and the group is waiting

WINFRIED
No no I have to sleep I walked through the
whole Ceausescu palace today

DASCALU
(with a Romanian accent)
Is it open again to public

Ines greets Dascalu a Romanian manager aged around 50 with a handshake The
group turns to leave
INES
(to Winfried)
Come on

WINFRIED

(quietly)
Oh right you want me to come now

Ines nods discreetly

EXT - DA VINC LAKESIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A classy restaurant where foreign businesspeople meet and the Romanian upper
class flashes its cash The group sits on a terrace near a swimming pool A select
group of people surrounds Henneberg Natalja Winfried and Ines along with three
further businesspeople M Vermillard Mr Myers and Dascalu They all appear to be
managers or business partners of Dacoil Winfried has a large glass of beer in front
of him The others are more refined with glasses of wine and champagne

HENNEBERG
Bring your wife next time and spend a
weekend The sea is very close and there are
good French private schools Romania is a lot
better than its reputation You can have a good
life here

He’s addressing the French businessman Vermillard who will soon take up a post in
Bucharest

VERMILLARD
I saw some houses today I am already
convinced

Natalja is sitting next to Ines

INES
(to Natalja)
Where do you live

NATALJA

I live mostly in Frankfurt and France
INES

How nice
NATALJA

I really like Frankfurt I like countries with a
middle class They are relaxing me
INES
(in German)
I totally understand

Ines picks up a piece of octopus carpaccio and tries to give some to Winfried but he
refuses

INES (CONTD)
Try something different for a change

WINFRIED
You know me

Ines focuses on the conversation

MYERS
But the crazy times are over

HENNEBERG
There is still a lot of potential I just told Van
Rompuy letting Romania in was one of the rare
EU decisions that was actually good You just
have to change the corporate culture

VERMILLARD
(to Henneberg and Dascalu)
Tell me a bit about the young Romanian manager
generation

Dascalu is about to respond when Henneberg turns to Ines

HENNEBERG
She is the specialist She has all the insights

For a moment Ines is surprised that he’s deferring to her on such a pertinent
question

INES
So when I started here I was really surprised
Almost everyone did a Master’s degree abroad
speaks several languages They are all very
dedicated I would even say most of them have a
very international way of thinking Which is
great

Ines’ English is so perfect that she could be mistaken for an American The way in
which she speaks is self-confident and to-the-point Dascalu the Romanian manager
interrupts her
DASCALU
But they don’t understand Romania any more
They are faster than the rest of the country they
don’t want to stay here I don’t believe very much
in an international perspective

INES
I was just trying to say that knowledge is
international I totally agree with that too

DASCALU
Romanian knowledge runs deep Take a look at
our oilfields

It’s not clear how ironic he’s being To be safe Ines laughs Winfried is listening
distractedly to a mediocre pianist

VERMILLARD
(to Ines)
What exactly are you doing in Dacoil

INES
Iam aconsultant at Morrisons We are working
for Dacoil evaluating if it will pay off to outsource
some services

Dascalu frowns briefly and Henneberg notices this

HENNEBERG
(in German)
Interesting how you describe your job

His tone is cutting

INES
(in German)
I’m sorry please say it in your own words

HENNEBERG
(in English to the group)
She is evaluating a way to improve our
maintenance service We see outsourcing as the
last option of many

INES
I’m sorry this is what I tried to say

For amoment the group falls silent
HENNEBERG
But her father had a great business idea for
Romania He hired another girl at home to be his
daughter Because this one is never there and he
needs somebody to cut his toenails

Everyone laughs slightly Ines too bravely laughs along Henneberg checks his
watch Winfried puts the false teeth in his mouth and quietly mutters at Henneberg

WINFRIED
Don’t you dare steal my idea

He very quickly puts the teeth away again

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Sorry I like to make jokes

Henneberg laughs indulgently but it’s clear that he’s now dismissed Winfried as a
total madman

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
(in German)
No were incredibly proud of her What she does
here and stuff

Ines smiles trying to rise above the situation Henneberg gestures at a WAITER to
bring him the check Henneberg stands up and shakes hands with everyone

Now that Henneberg is gone the rest of the group immediately dissipates Dascalu
follows Henneberg The Belgian and the Frenchman talk for another minute The
waiter brings Winfried another beer

EXT - DA VINC LAKESIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Ines and Winfried now sit alone at the otherwise empty table with Winfried’s beer
Ines remains silent for a while trying to cope with her anger

INES
Why do you do stuff like that when I’ve explicitly
asked you not to

WINFRIED
I somehow had to make it clear to him that it was
a joke What exactly is “outsourcing” again
INES
It’s when you transfer work to another company
He wants to transfer the maintenance of the oil
installations to another company

WINFRIED
So what was wrong with that

INES
I just shouldn’t have let it slip out He wants us
to prove that it’s precisely the right thing to do
but he doesn’t want it to be his idea - so he can
pin the responsibility on us if he needs to

She doesn’t want to talk about it

WINFRIED
And what are you responsible for

INES
Dad these processes mean hundreds of
employees being transferred and later laid off
These kind of decisions are unpopular so he
needs to be able to blame someone else Then
you can read in the paper again that some
consulting firm has ruined something

WINFRIED
It’s incredible the kinds of decisions you’re
involved in making

INES
Again I don’t make any decisions I just do the
calculations You know that

WINFRIED
I’m not criticizing you I just want to understand
it What these projects are about

INES
How long are you planning to stay

WINFRIED
I took a month off

Ines freezes for a second
WINFRIED (CONT’D)
That was real fear

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

Winfried sits on a freshly-made sofa-bed digging in his suitcase He swallows a
couple of pills from his new pillbox The room’s decor is impersonal Ines steps into
the doorway and watches as Winfried takes a bag from his suitcase and tries to
smooth out a gift’s crumpled wrapping paper From it hangs a photo of Willi which
he quickly removes

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

In the living room Winfried puts a sausage from his local butcher a bottle of
Riesling and a packet of Aachener Printen gingerbread cookies on the table Ines
quickly takes a final look at her laptop which is also on the table The living room
opens out onto a large roof terrace The whole place seems sterile and a bit
American the kind of luxury you can find anywhere in the world Only a few objects
hint at the fact that we’re in Eastern Europe

INES
I just have a massage tomorrow After that I’ll
show you Bucharest

WINFRIED
OK but only if it suits you So here’s your
present If you don’t like it throw it away

INES
Thank you Why didn’t you wait and come on
my actual birthday

WINFRIED
I don’t know what your plans are

Ines unwraps the gift and pulls out an expensive designer cheese grater

INES
Oh wow

WINFRIED
That’s a really good cheese grater A French one
from Designo

Ines puts the grater to one side and folds the wrapping paper
WINFRIED (CONT’D)
I just happened to walk past the store It always
annoys me when the parmesan is so hard
There’s something in that little roll too Buy
yourself a blazer or something else

INES
You don’t have to give me money Thank you

She doesn’t open up the roll of bills

INES (CONTD)
And who did you leave Willi with

WINFRIED
Well Willi Willi unfortunately died

Ines looks at him confused and a bit shocked

INES
What When

WINFRIED
A couple of days ago

INES
And what was wrong with him

WINFRIED
Fluid on his lungs He’d had it for a while

Ines walks over to Winfried and tries to give him a hug but he shrinks away

INES
And why didn’t you even call me

WINFRIED
Because I don’t always have the time either

Winfried stands up and walks into the kitchen to put the groceries into the
refrigerator Ines watches him

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Would you like some sausage

INES
Not for me thanks

Winfried looks for a knife to cut up the sausage The kitchen is barely furnished
INT - HOTEL POOL AREA - DAY

Winfried waits on a lounger in the chic pool area of a hotel He’s taken off his shirt
and rolled up his jeans Ines approaches wearing a bathrobe and flops down ona
lounger next to him

INES
Man that was bad I walked out I’m not paying
100 euros for someone to pet me

The SPA MANAGER arrives

SPA MANAGER
Weare sorry for the inconvenience Who was the
girl

INES
A blond skinny woman

SPA MANAGER
Mariella I am sure she is sorry There is a time
slot in 30 minutes with another masseur Dragos

INES

Just bring someone who beats me up
SPA MANAGER

Can I bring you something to drink
INES

At your expense
SPA MANAGER

Yes
INES

Oh great well have two glasses of champagne
two freshly squeezed orange juices and two club
sandwiches

The manager balks at the size of the order but says nothing He leaves

WINFRIED
Wasn’t that a bit much

INES
No it’s fine My company spends so much money
here It’s not as if he’s paying for it
WINFRIED
Your mother said youre in love
Will the gentleman introduce himself to me

INES
Oh I just said that so she’d stop asking me

WINFRIED
But are you a bit happy here at least

INES
What do you mean by “happiness” “Happiness”
is a strong word

WINFRIED
I mean do you have a bit of a life too

INES
Like going to the movies or something

WINFRIED
Well just doing something you enjoy

INES
Lots of words buzzing around here “fun”
“happiness” and “life” We should sort things out

Suddenly Ines gives Winfried a serious look

INES (CONTD)
What do you think it’s worth living for If you
want to discuss the big topics

WINFRIED
I can’t say that off the top of my head I really just
wanted to know how youre doing

INES
I know that But then you should have your own
answer

Winfried considers but can’t come up with a response

INES (CONTD)
One day Ill explain to you how to ask questions
if you want to find something out about
someone
The two flutes of champagne arrive They briefly clink their glasses together
Winfried puts in the false teeth flops back on the lounger and drinks his champagne
with gusto Ines ignores his joke

INES
Tell me something about you How’s Grandma
doing

WINFRIED

That’s a good sign ma’am I wasn’t at all sure
whether you knew your Grandma was still alive

INES
Dad I’m tired of your jokes

WINFRIED
Why

INES
Because I don’t find them funny

Ines’ cellphone rings She looks at the screen and stands up when she sees who’s
calling She walks away The WAITER brings the club sandwiches Ines hangs up and
returns to Winfried

INES (CONT’D)
Shit I have to meet Natalja Henneberg’s wife
She’s at this mall I’m afraid it’s important

She starts to pack her bag Winfried takes another bite of his sandwich

INES (CONTD)
It’s actually way more interesting and Romanian
than the Ceausescu palace It’s Europe’s largest
mall and no one has money to buy anything It
wont take long I’ll show you around afterwards

INT - SHOPPING MALL - VIEWING GALLERY - DAY

Winfried sits on a stool at a bar table and looks out from a viewing gallery onto an
ice rink A group of children is trying to skate with the help of plastic penguins
Weaving between them are a couple of young professionals who glide elegantly
across the ice A WAITER brings the check Winfried gulps the dregs of his coffee and
picks up his tattered newspaper He stands up The mall is a temple to consumption
beyond anything found even in the USA waterfalls tumbling over plastic cliffs an ice
rink slot machines and stores These elements come together in an explosion of
capitalist futurism Winfried walks past huge ice cream dispensers Next to them a
bored woman reads a book

INT - SHOPPING MALL - DAY

Winfried walks along a row of storefronts searching He spots Ines who’s still
talking to Natalja in front of a shoe store Natalja sees him first Ines follows her gaze
and turns around

NATALJA
I’m so sorry Mr Conradi This is such an awful
place

INES

(in German)
You poor thing you had to wait ages

Ines briefly puts her arm in Winfried’s A man Natalja’s DRIVER silently appears
next to them

NATALJA
I have to hurry Thank you Ines you saved my
life

INES

No I really enjoyed it

To prove her point she holds up a shopping bag full of things she’s bought for
herself Natalja kisses Ines on both cheeks and disappears

INES (CONT’D)
Man was it very terrible

WINFRIED
Are you really a human
(BEAT)
No it was great here I watched some wonderful
ice skating I went to Lidl too

INES
Do you still want to do something Go to the
Ceausescu palace

WINFRIED
Or go home
INT - INES’ APARTMENT - OPEN-PLAN KITCHEN - NIGHT

Back in the apartment Winfried stands the kitchen where he’s started making
spaghetti He chops an onion and looks at Ines who’s on her phone on the roof
terrace She comes back inside and sits down in front of her computer Winfried puts
a glass of red wine down next to it

INES
Thanks

WINFRIED
Are you hungry yet Everything OK spaghetti

Winfried rubs her neck

INES
No not yet

WINFRIED
Sorry for my stupid comment earlier

INES
What comment

WINFRIED
Whether you’re a human

INES
It’s OK It’s obvious you’d think that I’m going
to take a short nap I might have to show the
Hennebergs a new club later but not till around
midnight

She disappears into her bedroom

INTEXT - INES’ APARTMENT - KITCHEN - ROOF TERRACE - NIGHT

Winfried stands in Ines’ kitchen cooking Out on the roof terrace he sets a table
that’s otherwise never used He puts the salad and spaghetti on the table

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - INES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

Winfried opens the door to Ines’ bedroom Ines is fast asleep He calls to her but she
doesn’t react He kneels down next to her and touches her shoulder but she’s
sleeping deeply and soundly He looks at her sparse possessions Next to her on the
bed is a threadbare little corduroy pillow that he seems to recognize He closes the
door again
INTEXT - INES’ APARTMENT - TERRACE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Winfried stands on the roof terrace He picks up his camera and takes a photo of the
Ceausescu palace which is visible in the distance Then he photographs parts of
Ines’ apartment He looks at a pile of books and picks up one that’s lying on top It’s a
best-selling self-help book about charisma He walks back to the terrace sits down
alone and starts eating and flicking through the book

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - INES’ BEDROOM - DAY

The next morning Winfried enters Ines’ room wearing pajamas He cautiously
wakes her

WINFRIED
So it’s getting-up time now

Ines sits up

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
I was starting to think you were dead

INES
What time is it

WINFRIED
Nine-thirty You slept for ages

Ines hurriedly grabs her Blackberry

INES
What Why didn’t you wake me up
WINFRIED
You were so fast asleep
INES
I thought you wanted to wake me up for dinner
WINFRIED
I tried to
INES
Shit

She walks past Winfried and out of the bedroom
INTEXT - INES’ APARTMENT - KITCHEN - ROOF TERRACE - DAY
Ines pulls her cellphone from its charger Winfried follows her uncertainly

INES
I have four missed calls from them You told me
you were making something to eat

WINFRIED
I thought you needed the sleep Or that you’d set
an alarm

INES

Do you know what this could mean for me I
have a presentation on Monday that I’ve worked
on for weeks I’m not doing this for fun I can’t
afford to just stand up someone like him

Ines grabs the charisma book from Winfried and puts it away She looks frantically
at her cellphone Winfried sits down at the table which he has lovingly set for
breakfast

WINFRIED
I just don’t know if you’re always doing as well
as you Say you are

INES
Dad this is going to sound cruel but even if I
wanted to jump out of the window you and the
cheese grater wouldn’t be the combination to
stop me

WINFRIED

(quietly)
No of course not

INES
Do you have any plans in life other than slipping
fart cushions under people

WINFRIED

(quietly)
I don’t own a fart cushion

INES
I know men your age who still have ambitions
But who cares
Ines slowly sits down at the table Winfried pours coffee for her

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - DAY

Winfried stands in his room packing his suitcase Ines comes and hands him a bottle
of shampoo he left in the bathroom

WINFRIED
(mumbling)
Anyway it was still really nice Now I know the
kinds of things you do here

INES
Yeah and let’s fix a date next time Then I’ll have
time

Ines turns away to fold up the sofa-bed She shakes it because it’s refusing to fold
Suddenly she screams in pain and pulls the sofa abruptly upwards She’s caught her
toe in it Her pain is extreme She looks at her toe in shock Right away a pool of
blood forms underneath the toenail Winfried inspects her foot

WINFRIED
It’s definitely not broken though

The doorbell rings

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
I could pierce it to release the pressure

INES
No Ill wait first

She stands up and suppresses the pain Whatever happens she wants Winfried to
leave

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - HALLWAY - ELEVATOR - DAY

Hobbling Ines accompanies Winfried to the door where his suitcase is waiting He
hangs a travel pouch around his neck with his plane ticket inside Ines presses the
elevator “call” button

WINFRIED
But I can’t leave you here like this

INES
It’s not that bad Well then bye
They hug briefly

INES (CONTD)
Call me if anything’s wrong

Winfried nods Winfried and Ines stand in silence waiting for the elevator to arrive
The elevator arrives and Winfried disappears into it

INTEXT - INES’ APARTMENT - HALLWAY - ROOF TERRACE - DAY

Ines hobbles onto her roof terrace and looks out over the edge The building is tall
and her father is visible only as a tiny figure He looks up and spots her He stands
still for a moment as if he’s forgotten something Then he waves at her She waves
back Suddenly tears start streaming over her cheeks Ines starts sobbing and
watches tearfully as the taxi disappears around a corner

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT

It’s now gotten dark Ines is wearing pajamas and drinking wine With the
concentration of an actress learning lines she rehearses and refines her
presentation Her “performance” stands in stark contrast to the image she projects
in her pajamas She tweaks certain words and we notice that she’s honing her
intonation As she murmurs about EU regulations and economic viability she walks
to the refrigerator She tries to ignore her painful foot She finds the leftover
spaghetti that her father has carefully covered with plastic film Next to it is the
cheese grater She takes a piece of parmesan walks back to her laptop and starts to
grate the parmesan onto the spaghetti She coils the spaghetti absent-mindedly
around her fork and eats hungrily while she surfs the internet

EXT - STREET IN FRONT OF INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

Ines waits in front of her apartment block She’s wearing a suit and typing
something on her Blackberry We hear notification sounds as she sends emails She
takes off her shoe and puts her foot down on the asphalt A WOMAN sits on the
street opposite her trying to sell two bunches of flowers A CHILD approaches Ines
and offers her a packet of kleenex She gives the child a bill and explains to him that
she wont give him something every day There’s a honk Ines slips her shoe back on
hobbles towards a dark-colored sedan car and climbs into the back

INT - INES’ CAR - JOURNEY FROM APARTMENT TO DACOIL - DAY

Ines’ boss GERALD (late 40s) and TIM (late 20s) an athletic-looking young
consultant are already in the car Ines sits next to Gerald
GERALD
Bucuresti

Tim turns around to Ines and smiles at her

INES
Good morning Were you on the same flight

GERALD
No I was in Zurich And how was it with
Henneberg

INES
A bit annoying because I had to go shopping
with his wife for three hours But we had dinner
and IJ put out my feelers My impression is that
he’s become more cautious of outsourcing or
that he has new opponents That topic definitely
caused tension

GERALD
OK that comes as a surprise

INES
So I reworked the presentation and I think we
should definitely --

TIM
Use a softer touch

Tim is keen to join in and score points with Gerald Ines pauses and smiles at him

INES
Can I finish what I was saying

Tim bites his tongue

INES (CONTD)
I think we should go on the offensive I think he’s
hoping well decide for him that well
emphatically order it I think he can’t be an active
proponent So Id like to present three options A
full outsourcing in all assets - essentially a
radical cut Then our option in the middle which
in contrast looks realistic and almost harmless
And a minimal solution in just one pilot asset
that changes practically nothing
GERALD
OK I’m surprised First of all I think it’s difficult
to change the strategy so close to a meeting
Where did you eat

INES
Da Vinci

GERALD
Right now I’m not convinced

INES

Argument number two is Iliescu We have to
make the point that he’s blocking us At the end
of the day all the figures from Buzau are flawed
For a clear business case we’d need much more
from Iliescu Every other table is incomplete

(to Tim)
I’m not criticizing you but we can’t make a clear
statement anyway so that’s why we need three
options

TIM
OK

It takes a while until Gerald answer

GERALD
Illiescu isn’t an issue for the steering committee
Well put this in a comfort zone The three
options are OK if you really feel confident

INES
Absolutely The final point is Dascalu Things are
still difficult with him I think we should involve
him more Also because of Illiescu He has the
best rapport with him He’ll definitely be our
opponent

GERALD
Is that little Anca going to be there today as well

INES
Yes shell be clicking the PowerPoint
EXT - STREET IN FRONT OF DACOIL OFFICES - DAY
The car pulls up near Dacoil’s office building Gerald gets out

TIM
Do you want me to be there

INES
I think it’s better if I do it alone Let’s talk about
that in a minute

TIM
OK

Ines’ foot is extremely painful when she stands on it

INES
Everything’s OK

Ines nods They walk towards the office building adjusting their suits in preparation
for a brief moment of performance Ines makes an effort to walk normally despite
the fact that her foot is still very sore

INT - DACOIL OFFICES - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

Ines kneels on the floor of a toilet stall In front of her lies an open first aid kit She
takes out a syringe and pokes its needle aggressively into her toenail With the
pressure released a fountain of blood shoots through the tiny hole The blood
sprays into her face and onto her light-colored blouse Ines sits up and needs a
moment to overcome her queasiness She reaches for some bathroom tissue and
wipes the blood from her face then grabs her cellphone and dials a number

INT - DACOIL OFFICES - BATHROOM - DAY

Ines exits the toilet stall She’s now wearing an unfamiliar blouse with short sleeves
and a floral pattern She pulls her blazer on over it and looks at herself in the mirror
Anca exits another stall She’s now wearing Ines’ blood-spattered blouse

ANCA
Is it OK

INES
Yes Thank you

ANCA
Iam sorry It’s not my best
INES
No it’s just because of the presentation
(in German)
It’s an unusual color

Ines glances at the blood-stained blouse Anca now wears

ANCA
lll just put my hair over it

Ines looks impatiently at her watch They seem to be waiting for something

ANCA (CONT’D)
She is coming
(BEAT)
(in German)
I wanted to ask are you pleased with my workin
general

INES
Absolutely I think you’ve really improved I just
think you should try to speak more German

ANCA
I know but it’s not enough for everyday use

INES
One more minor thing It’s really silly but I don’t
like those smilies in emails I know what you
mean without them

ANCA
I know I am a bit addicted

They’re silent for a moment

ANCA
Why don’t we go out like all together the
whole team To a club or for dinner

INES
OK

ANCA
It could be nice just for the team
Ines looks impatiently at her watch

INES
Thank you Ill think about it

The door opens and FLORA a young consultant wearing very high-heeled shoes and
a skirt suit enters the bathroom She appears to have run there She takes off her
jacket and shows Ines her blouse which is very girly and exposes her back

INES
No this one is better

INT - DACOIL OFFICES - EXECUTIVE FLOOR - DAY

Ines follows INGRID across the tastefully-designed executive floor of the office
building They disappear into a conference room in which Gerald and Dascalu are
already waiting She greets them both

INT - DACOIL OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A modern conference room Henneberg sits next to Gerald Dascalu and two further
ROMANIAN MANAGERS all in leather chairs Ines stands in front of a PowerPoint
presentation The tables on the slides create patterns on her face She’s alert
keeping an eye on everyone in the room especially Henneberg Ingrid sits silently in
front of a laptop and loads the next slide for Ines

INES
For option one we assume that it will take one
year for the implementation The
implementation cost internal and external will
be around five to six million euros The
advantage of a full outsourcing is the contractor
rates We will have a strong competition
resulting in lower rates That’s why we will end
with a ten-per-cent cost reduction in the first
year

DASCALU
I doubt very much that we will have such strong
cost reduction so quickly It takes years to
transfer all our knowledge to the contractors

Gerald nods in agreement towards Dascalu It seems to be a tactical move
Henneberg is listening very attentively but lets the others doing the talking
INES
I totally agree with you We surely need to go
further into the details of each scenario
(to Ingrid in German)
Ingrid switch to the next slide please

Ingrid loads a new slide

INES (CONTD)
Option two will take about ten months with
significantly higher contractor rates Option
three takes eight months with even higher
contractor rates

DASCALU
There is no way in which you can outsource any
maintenance services in only ten months This is
impossible This is more than
(addressing one of the Dacoil
managers in Romanian)
How many employees What do you think

DACOIL MANAGER
Approximately two hundred workers

DASCALU
Plus you have to consider high costs for
supervision and training from our side too I
don’t see them there

INES
What I also think what we should put into
account is that Dacoil didn’t even realize
international HSSR standards in all assets So we
don’t have a business case yet But a very strong
trend You all agreed that the implementation of
any option will not be done faster than one year
which is also in line with HR So we know that
the main driver is the contractor rates and I
know them

HENNEBERG
This is my experience too

GERALD
Absolutely
INES
So as soon as have realistic figures of the
personnel we can guarantee a positive business
case for option two and even for option one

Dascalu shakes his head slightly

Dascalu nods

DASCALU
Option one is not possible

GERALD

OK I absolutely agree with Mr Dascalu that
there are many open questions There is a lot
that needs to be analyzed in more detail But I
would like to support Ms Conradi From my
point of view at least option 2 is necessary The
big picture will not change and is absolutely in
line with my experiences from other countries
Thank you Ines

(addressing Henneberg)
So now we need directions Titus

HENNEBERG
Gents we really need a waterproof and positive
business case before we can start anything What
you are proposing speaking of option one would
be a heavy change for our operations Option two
seems more realistic to me at the moment That
also needs to be verified legally We all know
how difficult this process will be regarding the
unions

GERALD
Absolutely Titus

HENNEBERG
We have to think carefully and we need to go
into more details But it is a very interesting
proposal

GERALD
(to Henneberg)
At the end of this month we should have all
calculations done
INES
Sorry but I think we cannot promise anything as
long as the cooperation with Buzau will not work
better

Gerald is briefly taken aback by Ines’ frank interjection Ines looks at Dascalu

INES (CONTD)
I would like to sit down with you Mr Dascalu to
discuss how we can work more closely together
with Mr Iliescu

Dascalu waits a little too long before answering

DASCALU
I will see what I can do

HENNEBERG
OK gents get this solved I think we are done
Thanks a lot

Henneberg stands up and swiftly says goodbye He was itching to leave anyway
Gerald and Ines stay behind and Ingrid is also still in the room The PowerPoint now

displays the company’s logo with the slogan “Performance delivered”

INES
So

GERALD
I don’t like that you don’t stick to the plan The
Illiescu thing wasn’t exactly elegant The next
steps are clear But please inform me if there are
any more problems

INES
OK I will
GERALD
But otherwise well done You’re an animal
Ines
INES
Thanks
INGRID

Can I pull up the screen

INES
Yeah sure
INT - DACOIL OFFICES - KITCHENETTE - DAY

Ines walks through a modern open office She finds Tim in a little Kitchenette Tim
fumbles with a coffee machine Ines leans next to him

INES
Come on don’t be offended Be happy you
werent there

TIM
I’m not offended

INES
To quote Gerald It’s all included in your price

TIM
Yes but Gerald’s prices are different to mine
What are you doing tonight

INES
I’m meeting Steph de Boer and Tatjana

TIM
Women’s group

INES
Yeah exactly We talk about gender quotas
sexual harassment at work things like that

EXT - DA VINC LAKESIDE RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Ines gets out of a taxi and walks through a landscaped garden towards a well-lit
restaurant Expensive cars crowd the private parking lot Guests come and go The
restaurant appears to be popular Ines has applied heavier make-up and is wearing
high-heeled shoes

INT - DA VINCI LAKESIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Ines enters the lakeside restaurant in which she previously had dinner with
Henneberg Two female FRONT OF HOUSE STAFF ask her for her reservation The
restaurant’s decor is clearly intended to exude an air of luxury People sit at tables
or wait at the packed bar for their reservations Foreign businesspeople mix with
rich Romanians clad in polo shirts and gold chains with their skinny girlfriends in
high heels Ines spots two women who have already snagged bar stools Tatjana the Dutchwoman we met at the embassy reception and STEPH an
American
INES
Hello Sorry I’m late but I had to get changed
after work

TATJANA
You look great

INES
Thanks you

STEPH

You work way too much Ines

INES
I know but it’s really busy at the moment I had a
big thing today

TATJANA
Wow How did it go

INES
I made a last-minute strategy change but it went
OK

STEPH
Did you check out the caterers I gave her
Dariu’s number

INES
(to Tatjana)
I’m hosting a small party for my birthday Next
Saturday Are you free

TATJANA
How nice

STEPH
Dariu is the best

INES
(to Tatjana)
How was the night with the Chinese

TATJANA
(to Steph)
After 30 minutes they were drunk and I sat there
for five hours listening to Mandarin But I sold
one flat at least
STEPH
We were just fighting over who had the most
horrible weekend

INES
Oh how was Naples

STEPH
Short version Naples is even dirtier than
Bucharest and you can find much better Italian
food here in town Even the kids were dying to
get back

TATJANA
They should bring us a drink

INES
Actually your weekend sounds fun to me I had
the most horrible weekend of my entire life

Ines sinks her voice dramatically

INES (CONTD)
My father visited me spontaneously without any
warning Out of nowhere he was there waiting
in my office Pretending he wanted to bring me
my birthday present But actually he was having
a crisis because his dog died

Steph grimaces

Ines nods

INES (CONTD)
And Henneberg was there and wanted me to go
out with him and his wife the whole time

STEPH
Is Hennebersg still in town I should invite him to
our relaunch

INES
And my father was sitting around making
spaghetti and trying to talk with me about the
meaning of life

TATJANA
That’s why I like Mondays
Steph too has lost interest in Ines’ story

STEPH
How is the new wife

INES
Very Russian very skinny very blond

Ines looks around to make sure no one can hear her

STEPH
Better be careful

An older man sitting next to Tatjana has a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket He
adjusts it then lifts the dripping bottle from the bucket and addresses the women

TONI
Can I offer the ladies a glass of champagne

Ines freezes as she recognizes the man He has long dark hair and the false teeth are
firmly in place He just lisps slightly when he speaks Tatjana looks questioningly at
her friends

TATJANA
Do we want champagne

Tatjana looks at Steph and Ines

TONI
Please I can’t drink all this alone

TATJANA
Sure why not

Toni beckons to the BARTENDER and asks for three glasses Ines who is standing
diagonally behind him has stopped breathing He’s wearing a dark blue iridescent
suit jacket with a striped pocket square - it used to be his handkerchief Toni looks
at his watch and shakes his head The teeth give him an outlandishly wild character
There’s clearly something not entirely genuine about him but overall his outfit
somehow works

TONI

I’m waiting for Mr Tiriac for two hours now
TATJANA

Ion Tiriac
TONI

Yes I’m Toni Toni Erdmann
TATJANA
Tatjana Nice to meet you Toni

He shakes hands with the women For the first time he makes direct eye contact
with Ines Toni takes the chair next to Tatjana The waiter brings the glasses with
the champagne

TATJANA
Do you work here in Bucharest Toni

TONI
Yes and no I came here because of a famous
dentist He made all new My teeth were too
small And always I wanted something more
wild more dangerous

It’s clear that he’s inventing most of it on the spot He smiles Steph and Tatjana
aren’t sure whether to take the whole thing seriously

STEPH
Who is this crazy dentist
TONI
The International Dental Design Clinic
STEPH
OK
TONI

The doctor is Italian Not a dentist More an
Italian architect

TATJANA
So you are just friends with Tiriac

TONI
We played tennis together in Germany

TATJANA
Interesting

Toni looks at his cellphone Stuck to the back of it is a piece of paper with his own
phone number

TONI
But he not answers the phone He has a crisis
because his
(mixing German and English)
His Schildkrote died
He looks at Ines She realizes he heard what she said about him earlier

STEPH
What’s a “schillgréde”

INES

(quietly)
A turtle

TONI
He is crying the whole day The turtle was very
old They spent 45 years together
(again mixing German and English)
And then Herzinfarkt

TATJANA
Iam sorry to hear that
TONI
For me it’s just a turtle
STEPH
May I ask what your profession is
TONI
My what
INES

(in German catching herself mid-
sentence and switching from the
familiar to the formal “you”)

Dein Ihr Beruf (your profession)

TONI
I’m a businessman consultant and coach

TATJANA
What’s your focus If you say you’re into
coaching

TONI
My focus is life and style

The waiter arrives and speaks to Toni He points at a nearby table which is set for
one On it is a plate with a large lobster Winfried’s grocery bag hangs from the back
of the chair

WAITER
Do you want to finish it
TONI
(again mixing German and English)
Oh yes my Hummer is waiting

WAITER
(to the group)
Or do you want to sit together

INES

(quickly)
Oh no thank you

The waiter points to an available table

WAITER
So your table is free too

The women say goodbye to Toni

STEPH
Thanks for the champagne

TATJANA
So nice meeting you Toni

They walk to their table As soon as they’re out of earshot Tatjana and Steph start
rolling their eyes

TATJANA (CONTD)
What was that

STEPH
These teeth

TATJANA

And the thing with the turtle
Ines shrugs

STEPH
Yeah but some turtles can get really old

They sit down and reach for the menus Ines looks distractedly at Toni who’s
inspecting the lobster through his reading glasses Their eyes meet He briefly raises
his glass of beer

TATJANA
(to Steph)
So who is coming to your relaunch
STEPH
It’s going to be a bizarre mix of guests Gabriel
really invited everybody New clients possible
clients Friends supporters all the people from
our charity work He even wanted all the
drivers to be there

TATJANA
That’s nice

STEPH
I hope they don’t feel uncomfortable

TATJANA
So you rented the whole Players Club

Steph nods She too looks at Toni who is now trying to suck the meat out of a
lobster leg through his teeth

STEPH
Oh God That’s really disgusting
INES
What’s disgusting
STEPH
Just the way he eats He is definitely not waiting

for Tiriac

For a moment Ines seems to be annoyed by the way Steph’s talking about “her
father”

INES
A lot of managers have strange gurus

STEPH
Yeah maybe

TATJANA
You never know

Steph starts typing something on her cellphone Part of her still wonders whether
Toni really might be someone important Ines watches as an UNKNOWN MAN
wearing a suit and a bowtie approaches Toni’s table Toni looks at his watch and
invites him to sit down but the man wants to leave Toni struggles with the lobster
for another moment then gestures at the waiter to bring the check Ines’ and
Tatjana’s starters arrive Toni stands up and raps his knuckles on the women’s table
(a departing gesture in Germany)
TONI
(mixing English and German)
Ich muss My limousine waits
(in German)
It was very nice to meet you

He looks at Ines as he says it Steph quickly whips out a business card and hands it
with professional nonchalance to Toni

STEPH
My husband runs a headhunting company If
there is anything we can do for you or Mr Tiriac
we would be happy to

Toni gratefully takes the card Steph waits for him to reciprocate but he doesn’t He
leaves Tatjana laughs at Steph

TATJANA
You are really a pro

INES
Excuse me

Ines stands and picks up her handbag as if she’s going to the bathroom

EXT - DA VINC RESTAURANT - EXIT AREA - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Ines walks to the restaurant’s busy exit and stands hesitantly in the entrance area A
white stretch limo is parked in the lot Toni stands next to it undecided Ines
retreats behind a glass screen and watches as her father looks towards the
restaurant Then he pats the driver on the shoulder and really does climb into the
limo She steps out of the restaurant and watches him leave

INT - DA VINCI LAKESIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Ines walks back to her table The waiter arrives and brings her a rich chocolate cake
decorated with lit sparklers She turns it down because she didn’t order it

WAITER
It’s from the man who just left He told me to
send his dessert to you

TATJANA
It seems like you have an admirer Ines

Even though she’s being ironic Tatjana still seems to be irritated that the dessert is
intended for Ines Steph receives an SMS
STEPH
Shit he didn’t give me his card Gabriel just
texted
(quoting the message)
“Tiriac Cool” He wanted to invite him to the
party

Suddenly Ines starts eagerly eating the chocolate cake

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ines cautiously opens her apartment door as if there might be someone inside She
looks into all of the rooms She walks around unsettled She dials her father’s
number again but he doesn’t pick up She carefully opens a closet The apartment is
empty

INT - OFFICE BUILDING - MEETING ROOM - DAY

It’s early morning Ines has retreated into a glass-walled meeting room and is
Skyping with a middle-aged man who seems to be some kind of COACH He’s having
breakfast on the terrace of some lakeside hotel

INES
The speaking went well It doesn’t need any
more work I made good use of the space I spent
time in the room beforehand too

COACH
And what about the breathing technique

INES
I didn’t need it this time But I would like to do
some more work on my body language
Sometimes I lose control of it

A woman flits across the screen The coach murmurs to her that he’ll be with her
shortly

COACH
Do you have an example

INES
It tends to be when I’m listening

COACH
I suspect youre really listening in those
moments That’s noble of course but maybe you
need to focus more on your own message Did
anything surprise you

INES
Not in terms of the content But maybe the
tone Dascalu argued very aggressively

COACH
Did it affect you on a personal level

INES
It might have done

COACH
Maybe there’s some kind of imbalance with
regard to your identification You’re only good
when you identify yourself Identification is an
important tool for you But it’s a tool that you
need to be able to set aside

Gerald knocks on the glass door He gestures at Ines that he’s ina hurry then enters
the room He knows the man she’s Skyping with and waves briefly at the screen

GERALD
Can I grab you for a second

EXT - OFFICE BUILDING - ROOF TERRACE - DAY

Gerald and Ines walk across the office building’s broad roof terrace They pass a
seating area set in a small artificially-landscaped garden

GERALD
I have the feeling the team isn’t so tight anymore
Tim thought the same Think of something to
boost the team spirit to prevent a gulf opening
up between the Romanians and us They’ve lost
their morale somehow

INES
Yeah I thought so too That corresponds with
my impression I’m holding a brunch for my
birthday anyway so Ill invite everyone then

GERALD
Very nice something personal Good

Gerald walks away from the building as if he’s purposefully looking for a secluded
spot
GERALD (CONT’D)
Well work with the numbers we have and won’t
make a fuss about them

INES
Why

GERALD
Your idea of building up pressure through
Dascalu backfired He and Illiescu won’t be
discussing our project

INES
OK Why not

GERALD
Dascalu trusts Illiescu and sees no need to act
And Henneberg wants to keep Dascalu out of it
so he can negotiate with the unions

Suddenly Ines notices as her father or rather Toni appears some distance away
and walks towards her holding a cup of coffee and a newspaper

INES
So on what basis should I continue my work
The transport data is all wrong Many more
people work there You can’t cut enough staff
here

GERALD
Everyone agrees with you on that one The good
news is Henneberg wants you to do the radical
cut

INES
But that was totally unfounded Surely you
realized it was all on the verge of speculation
Above all to sell such a big restructuring now I
really do need precise figures

GERALD
This will annoy the feminist in you But to quote
Henneberg “Ms Conradi has enough charm to
manage Illiescu by herself”

INES
I’m nota feminist Gerald Otherwise I wouldn’t
tolerate guys like you
GERALD
Ill take that as a compliment

Ines watches tensely as Toni comes closer He holds his cellphone to his ear He’s
wearing the same iridescent jacket

TONI
(quietly into phone)
Mom I’m working here I can’t talk to you on the
phone the whole time Yes I’m taking my meds
And fruit Yeah bye

He puts the newspaper down on a bench opposite him and hides something
underneath it Then he sits down on the paper apparently by chance Nothing
happens Gerald looks at him with bemusement but then continues

GERALD
By the way Henneberg wants to keep you here
He really believes in you

INES
And what did you say to him

GERALD
That I’d talk to you But that I think youll finish
the project

INES
And our deal

GERALD
I know of course But we’re talking one year
max Then you can start at a whole new level in
Shanghai or somewhere else

INES
I’ve heard that a few times before I can manage
Bucharest just as well from Shanghai

GERALD
That’s not realistic This is your partner case
Then you can choose where you want to go

INES
Can we continue this conversation somewhere
else
GERALD
The alternative would be to hand over to Tim

INES
Right

In the background Toni sits down again on the suspicious newspaper and an
unnaturally drawn-out farting noise is heard Dissatisfied Toni stands up and does
something underneath the newspaper

TONI
(muttering)
That wasn’t funny though

INES
Ill think about it Now Id just like a coffee Can
we maybe go back inside

Ines is about to leave when Toni addresses her

TONI
(to Ines)
I was just wondering where we met What are
you doing here

With Gerald there Ines has no choice but to answer

INES
I work here We’re discussing something We’re
about to have a meeting

Ines walks towards the building Toni walks alongside them

TONI
I have to go inside too I’m about to havea
supervision with Mr Henneberg

They pause at the entrance to the building

TONI (CONT’D)
(to Ines)
I hope he’s a bit less stubborn today He’s
unbelievably frightened of the Romanians and
worried that his wife spends too much money

Ines tries to laugh Gerald looks expectantly at her waiting for her to introduce him
to Toni but she doesn’t
GERALD
Marburger

TONI
Erdmann Do you use hand lotion

Gerald shakes his head bewildered

TONI (CONT’D)
Then it’s probably me

Ines owes Gerald an explanation of who this guy is

INES
Mr Erdmann is a freelance coach

Gerald is still bemused but it seems to be an explanation

INES (CONTD)
So Ill be in touch with you again later about
the workshop

TONI
OK
GERALD
(to Ines)
Aworkshop for us
INES

Yes it’s being considered The idea was floated

TONI
(in German-inflected English)
We see If you willing

GERALD
Pardon

TONI
Willing You are willing
(in German)
Oh let’s drop the English It’s not going so well
today after all

Again Ines tries to take control of the situation
INES
That came from Dacoil It still needs to be
discussed

TONI
Yes I invented a program together with Lothar
Matthdaus Title “Shoes and Belt should fit
together”

Ines gives Toni a firm and decisive handshake
INES (CONTD)
Goodbye
INT - OFFICE BUILDING - BY ELEVATOR NEAR ROOF TERRACE - DAY
Ines walks so speedily to the elevator that Gerald has to hurry to keep up

GERALD
What kind of a freak is that

INES
Ill explain when we have more time

The elevator arrives and Gerald steps into it Ines turns around and takes her
cellphone from her bag as if it’s ringing

INES (CONT’D)
Ill be there in a minute

EXT - OFFICE BUILDING - ROOF TERRACE - DAY

Ines runs back and looks out onto the roof terrace Toni is no longer there

INT - OFFICE BUILDING - BY ELEVATOR NEAR ROOF TERRACE - DAY

Ines runs through a series of corridors searching Company employees walk pass
her She spots Toni stops him just before he gets into an elevator and forces him
into a corner Winfried immediately adopts his Toni pose and quickly puts in his
false teeth

INES
Listen are you insane Are you trying to ruin me
or what Dad I’m talking to you
Toni looks down and for a moment it seems like he might relent but then he fishes
a business card from his jacket He puts on his sunglasses

TONI
Well if this is about your father I’m not the right
man But if you want to work on your charisma
or if you notice you’re talking to no-one on the
phone you’re welcome to contact me at any
time

Before Ines can say anything he turns around and gestures at a MAN ina suit who’s
getting into the elevator

TONI (CONT’D)
Oh there’s my man

Toni greets the man and pats him on the shoulder From the man’s reaction
however it’s clear that he has no idea who Toni is The elevator doors close Ines
looks at the hand-drawn business card All it says is “T E - Toni Erdmann” and his
phone number Employees walk pass her Ines turns and walks back into the open-
plan office

INT - MARRIOTT HOTEL - STAIRCASE - DAY

Ines walks up the stairs in the Marriott Hotel She’s wearing a tight-fitting dress and
has tied her hair up

INT - MARRIOTT HOTEL - CORRIDOR AND ENTRANCE TO ROOM - DAY

She continues along a broad corridor with a blue carpet As she walks she re-applies
her lipstick She stops by a door tiredly straightens up and knocks Tim opens the
door He’s shirtless and speaking on his cellphone

INT - MARRIOTT HOTEL - BEDROOM - DAY

Ines enters the room and puts down her bag Tim comes over to her kisses her and
pays her a silent compliment as he continues listening to someone on the phone

TIM
But a two-masted boat is a lot of work I’m not
doing that with a five-man crew You can forget
Daniel He has to mix the cocktails Yeah send
some pics

He finishes the conversation puts his phone on silent and comes over to Ines who
has flopped down on a couch in the spacious hotel room
TIM (CONT’D)
This’ll be such a stupid sailing trip Ludwig now
wants to take a two-masted boat

He takes off one of Ines’ high-heeled shoes and starts massaging her foot After a
brief moment he guides her foot between his legs

INES
Oh so the maid hasn’t come yet

TIM
No Only Timidri Romanian lover for you

Ines laughs He kisses her and if he had his way he’d undress her right there and
then There’s a knock at the door and a quiet voice says “Room service” Tim goes to
the door and opens it A hotel employee carries in a cake stand and a bottle of white
wine Tim puts the cake stand on the floor next to Ines and uncorks the bottle

INES
Wow
TIM
Gerald found out about us by the way
INES
So what
TIM

He told me not to fuck you too much so you don’t
lose your bite

INES
Aha

TIM
I told him that’s why I fuck you And today I’m
going to sleep with you in every corner of this
room

Tim comes over to Ines and tries to undress her They kiss but Ines suddenly isn’t in
the mood

TIM (CONT’D)
What’s wrong

INES
Ill just watch you first Ill try to catch up
TIM
Hurry up then

Tim unfastens his pants and tries to undress Ines She flops back onto the couch and
takes a gulp of her white wine

INES
I don’t want to lose my bite

TIM
Come on don’t be so serious I’ll fuck you real
strong My sperm has superpowers

Ines can’t help but smile at his nonsense

INES
No my bite is really more important to me I’d
rather just watch you

Tim takes her foot and massages his crotch with it Ines pulls it back Tim grabs her
breasts kisses her and tries to ignore the fact that she’s not joining in

INES (CONTD)
I want you to try to hit one of the petit fours Ill
eat it afterwards

Ines can’t help but laugh Tim is irritated but too aroused to stop He approaches
her again and kisses her but she remains resolute and won’t let him undress her

TIM
Youre being serious Yeah OK

Tim starts pleasuring himself

TIM (CONT’D)
And which one exactly OK I’m going to come
now

Tim drops to his knees in front of her really does ejaculate over the cake stand and
then falls onto his back

TIM (CONT’D)
Youre stupid

Ines takes one of the dripping petit fours and bites into it Tim looks at her in disgust
and pulls up his pants He stands up and disappears into the bathroom Ines stays
there musing She digs in her handbag for her cellphone and dials a number
INES
(into phone)
Hello Steph it’s Ines Sorry to disturb you but
I’ve got the number of the Tiriac coach Yeah I
met him again It’s up to you but why not Yes I
am already getting dressed I will text you See
you later

Tim returns He sits down on the hotel bed with his laptop and starts scrolling
through Facebook Ines flops down next to him

TIM
Take a look at Gerald’s lady What a mama No
wonder he’s fucking his way around this place
How can he be stupid enough to post photos of
himself barbecuing

Tim clicks on a photo of Gerald his wife and their two children It’s a family
barbecue in front of a modern house with the table set a dog and children’s toys
strewn across the garden

INES
Men can really have a lot of fun

TIM
How come You fuck around too

INES
Yeah but I don’t have a wife waiting for me
somewhere buying these salads getting my
kids dressed and taking our dog to the vet

Tim takes a closer look at the photo and spots the dog One of its paws is bandaged

INES (CONTD)
He just has this house somewhere and he can
always go there Look closely Have you ever
seen him looking like that here

TIM
I think he looks frustrated

Gerald’s facial features are like the Mona Lisa’s It’s difficult to say whether he looks
serious or is smiling

INES
Let’s get going
EXT - CLUB - OUTDOOR AREA - NIGHT

The outdoor area of a nightclub A pool is illuminated with kitschy lights and
surrounded by curved seating areas fake palm trees and pseudo-Greek frescoes
The reception is already busy Aperitifs are being served Tatjana’s husband’s
headhunting company seems to be throwing money around Ines and Tim greet
Tatjana and a couple of people we don’t yet know In the background the hosts are
being photographed with their guests in front of a curved backdrop Ines looks
around Suddenly she spots her father or rather Toni He takes a beer from a tray
and also looks around When he spies Ines he raises his glass to her from afar From
a bar table he takes a bowl of nuts and empties it into his jacket pocket Ines pulls
herself together and approaches him

INES
Hello Mr Erdmann

TONI
Good evening

Suddenly both fall silent Toni gives Ines a couple of nuts from his jacket pocket She
takes them

TONI (CONT’D)
So have you calmed down a bit

INES
Is Tiriac still coming

TONI
He said he was yes But today was the funeral
for Angelina

INES
His turtle

TONI
Exactly

Tim looks over at them

TONI (CONT’D)
Am I supposed to do something in particular
here

INES
I wanted to give you a bigger audience

Tim strolls over to them with a drink for Ines He clearly feels obliged to rescue Ines
from her current conversation
TONI
(to Ines)
Let’s do it this way If you say “Rocky” I’Il hit
him

Toni shakes hands with Tim

TONI (CONT’D)
Erdmann pleased to meet you

Toni pulls his hand away as if in pain

TIM
Everything OK

Tim laughs and Toni pats him on the shoulder

TONI
Friends right

Toni offers Tim a couple of nuts from his jacket pocket and Tim takes them From
the way Tim positions himself next to Ines and briefly puts his hand on her back
Toni realizes that they have more than a professional relationship

TONI (CONT’D)
And what do your parents do for a living

TIM

We have a car dealership BMWs
TONI

And do you call home now and again
TIM

Ah yes
TONI

That’s good You get another nut for that Only
one I need to save the other one for Mr
Marburger

Toni gestures towards Gerald who appears in the background with two women
Ines stands up straight One of the women is the receptionist from the office lobby
Tim bemusedly takes a second nut from Toni’s hand

TONI (CONT’D)
You can learn a lot from your parents For
example I learned from my father how to use a
cheese grater We pass this down from
generation to generation

TIM
Is it a special cheese grater

Tim who is practiced in smalltalk is trying to take his conversational partner
seriously

TONI
No no a very ordinary little cheese grater
Question is How you hold the cheese the speed
at which you grate

Tim can’t help but laugh

TONI (CONT’D)
Don’t believe me then
(to Ines)
Do you like grating cheese

INES
Sadly I don’t have the time

TONI
Yes you have to be incredibly relaxed to handle a
cheese grater right Tense people often have
difficulties

He mimes a tense hand

INES
(to Tim)
Mr Erdmann is a freelance coach We met
through his work with Henneberg

TIM
OK

Gerald strolls over to them with two young Romanian women He greets Tim and
Ines

GERALD
They’re putting on quite a show here

TIM
No expense spared
Toni greets Gerald as if they know each other and Tim stares at them Ines allows
the situation to continue Toni taps the knot in Gerald’s necktie Suddenly Ines sees
Natalja She quickly turns to Gerald

INES
Is Hennebersg still here

GERALD
Yeah yeah We just had dinner

At that moment Ines spots Henneberg Accompanied by Steph he’s moving in their
direction while shaking hands with a few guests Toni follows her gaze and for a
moment he shrinks back to Winfried size

TONI
(muttering)
Hopefully he won’t drink so much today

Then he sets off deliberately walking towards Henneberg and patting him on the
shoulder as he passes At first the executive doesn’t recognize Winfried at all Toni
mutters to him

TONI (CONT’D)
I’m here incognito today

Henneberg reacts confused

HENNEBERG
Oh right

TONI
Well speak tomorrow

He grips Henneberg’s neck Gerald and Tim watch the interaction closely As she
passes him Steph speaks to Toni

STEPH
You have to meet my husband

TONI
Yes I just have to call my mother

Ines takes another glass from a WAITER and turns away to avoid Natalja and
Henneberg Toni walks on and ends up next to two women (ANA and FLAVIA) who
are struggling to hold their champagne glasses and eat from their plates Toni
spontaneously takes the plates from them The women laugh and try to take the
plates back Toni looks at Ines who’s watching him from a distance While Toni
holds the plates he exchanges business cards with the women Toni glances
towards Ines again Tim is bobbing around her ready to party Tatjana approaches
them both

TATJANA
Car party

TIM
Absolutely

INES

(in German)

I’m not sure Ill come later
(in English)

I will join you in a minute

Ines walks over to Toni who’s still holding the women’s plates He gestures
encouragingly at some remaining salad

TONI
(to Ines in German)
I was just learning a bit about Romanian
traditions

INES
(in German)
Mr Erdmann we’re going to the club and would
love you to join us

FLAVIA
And which embassy do you work at

TONI
(to Ines in German)
Translation please

INES
(bemused in German)
In which embassy you work

TONI
(in German)
In the German one
(to Flavia)
In the German Iam Ambassador Erdmann and
this is my secretary Ms Schnuck
FLAVIA
I work in the parliament Iam something like a
secretary too

TONI
Romania has a parliament I didn’t know that

FLAVIA
Sometimes it feels like this

Ines looks over at Tatjana and Tim who are leaving the club Toni stacks the
women’s empty plates on top of each other

TONI
Je voudrais excusé

He pronounces it like “I have to go” Flavia and her friend Ana nod Toni gives them
one of his business cards and gets one from Flavia in return Ines has already walked
a couple of meters away Steph passes her and playing the hostess touches her
shoulder briefly

TONI (CONT’D)
On telephone a causa des oeufs

INES
You just told them youll call them about the
eggs

TONI

That’s exactly right

EXT - OUTSIDE THE CLUB - NIGHT

Toni and Ines leave the poolside area and walk down a set of steps towards a
parking lot surrounded by nature Toni follows a little behind Ines Ines looks
around looking for something and Toni follows her without knowing where they’re
going They approach an SUV which is parked at the edge of a small forest Tatjana
and Tim are already waiting there

EXT - PARKING LOT OUTSIDE CLUB - NIGHT

The distant boom of a bass line competes with the chirping of crickets The club is
like a UFO landed in a wasteland Where the parking lot ends dense undergrowth
begins Tatjana has opened the doors to her dark-colored SUV with its light-colored
seats and for a moment a question hangs in the air What happens next
TIM
(quietly to Ines)
What are you doing with that guy

INES
I think it’s fun

Toni sits down on the back seat of the car in the open door Tatjana silently
questions Ines Ines nods and Tatjana starts preparing cocaine on a city map She
snorts a line then hands the map to Tim After Tim has snorted his line it’s Ines’
turn but she first offers it to Toni He declines

TONI
Thanks My heart

Ines quickly snorts her line Toni looks at the scenery For a moment everyone
stands around wrinkling their itchy noses and waiting for the drug to take effect
Tatjana starts putting make-up on Toni points to some leftover cocaine that Ines
has missed She doesn’t want to scrape it up so he dips his finger in it briefly and
rubs the cocaine into his gums

INES
(to Tim)
I told him youre looking for a coach

TIM
Sure I have so many problems with my boss and
I’d like to become more successful with women

TONI
You can’t even pay for that

Toni points at an imaginary spot on Tim’s shirt Tim looks down and at that
moment Toni taps him on the nose

TIM
Haha

A moment later Toni does the same thing again and Tim can only laugh half as
much Ines has now also started applying make-up Toni reaches into his jacket
pocket and pulls out a new little cheese grater and a piece of parmesan He grates a
little cheese onto his head He shakes himself Tim laughs bemusedly

TONI
So time to go inside you make-up babes I’ma
public official 1 don’t want to get arrested here
As Toni walks past Tim he once again taps his shirt and then his nose This time it
seems more like an attack

TIM
Enough already

EXT - OUTSIDE THE CLUB - NIGHT
The group walks back towards the club Toni walks next to Tim

TONI
(quieter)
How are your bowel movements at the moment

TIM
What does it have to do with you

TONI
I work a lot with bowel movements It’s like
reading tea leaves

TIM
Creamy

TONI
That’s good This morning mine glittered like
gold

He pats Tim on the shoulder They walk up some steps covered in a red carpet The
bass gets steadily louder guiding them into the club - the venue’s indoor section It
becomes clear that the poolside area where the reception was being held was
merely the outdoor section

INT - CLUB - DISCO - NIGHT

The club that now reveals itself is several times larger than the outdoor area It has
an aggressive lightshow dancers kitschy decor It’s the kind of club you only find in
Eastern Europe They’re led to a plush seating area next to a runway A couple of
other guests from the reception are already sitting in this VIP area Tim takes a
bottle of vodka from an ice bucket and starts pouring The dance version of Bob
Marley’s “No Woman No Cry” booms from the loudspeakers The lightshow gets
more dramatic and the room goes pitch dark apart from a few laser beams which
shoot aggressively through the darkness Tatjana shrieks and Ines whistles cooly
through her fingers They seem to know what’s about to happen A dwarf climbs out
of an oversized cake carrying a larger-than-life lollipop on his shoulders He’s
followed by a line of dancers whose legs appear even longer in his presence Tim
pulls out his iPhone and starts filming The dwarf whips the crowd into a frenzy and
the new girls start dancing The old dancers disappear into the cake Ines pours
vodka for Toni as if she’s challenging him

INES
Everything OK

Toni shrugs and tries to seem unfazed Gerald arrives at the VIP area with the
receptionist and another woman He makes a “party” gesture towards Ines and she
reciprocates Her movements are self-conscious Toni observes her from the side
She’s like a stranger to him Tim films Ines She shifts closer to Toni and makes a
“victory” sign Toni copies her Ines laughs into the camera as if she’s posing with an
amusing animal Everyone starts dancing Ines looks at Toni She knows she’s
showing her father something that’s new to him Toni starts to move For a moment
he seems young and agile He copies the others’ movements but the irony falls flat
in the midst of the overall excess

INT - CLUB - DISCO - NIGHT

The VIP lounge has now filled up Tatjana Tim and Ines are still bobbing around the
champagne bucket The dancers on the stage make acrobatic movements The show
has become more lavish A WAITER arrives with a fresh bottle of champagne

TONI
Ill pay for that

The waiter produces an electronic card reader and Toni rummages for his credit
card in his tattered leather wallet Tim starts tearing paper napkins from a holder
and throwing them in the air Tatjana demands that he unbutton his shirt further

TATJANA
It’s unfair Only women and a Lilliputian

Tim briefly fends her off then starts to enjoy showing off his six-pack A new song
starts Toni sits down on one of the sofas and wipes sweat from his forehead with
his handkerchief He watches his daughter He doesn’t recognize her Tim has
grabbed the champagne bottle and is holding it between his legs while he dances
from glass to glass He comes to Toni who lets him “pee” into his glass Tim watches
as Toni re-inserts his false teeth and stands up Toni pulls out the cheese grater and
starts to “help” Tim by grating cheese into the champagne Tatjana pulls her glass
away Ines topples swaying onto one of the plush sofas Only now do we realize
how drunk she is The effect of the cocaine has worn off Tim dances onwards to
Ines who suddenly seems very distant Toni grates a little cheese onto her hair Tim
approaches and dances around with the bottle at her mouth Ines digs in her
handbag and takes out two pills Tim wants her to open her mouth and wash down
the pills with champagne She pushes the neck of the bottle away The joke’s going
down so well that Tim carries on He starts to mime an orgasm
TIM
It’s a really expensive vintage

Toni grabs the bottle from his hand

TONI
That’s enough now

Ines stands up swaying

INES
(to Tim)
I’m going I have to go to Buzau tomorrow

TIM
(quietly)
Come on stay here a while longer It was just a
joke Should I come with you

Ines weakly raises her hand in farewell and then swiftly disappears into the crowd
It takes Tonia moment to realize she’s gone

EXT - OUTSIDE THE CLUB - NIGHT

Toni runs hurriedly out of the club Outside several taxis are waiting Party guests
are still coming and going Toni spots Ines just as she’s getting into a taxi The driver
holds the door open for her She sways as she gets in Toni runs towards her but the
taxi pulls away He too hurriedly looks for a taxi He fishes a small piece of paper
from his wallet and gives it to the driver

INT - BUCHAREST - TAXI - NIGHT

The taxi travels swiftly through night-time Bucharest Wide empty avenues are
flanked by imposing socialist-era buildings from which huge illuminated
advertising billboards shine Toni sits in the back seat and looks out of the window
INTEXT - STREET IN FRONT OF WINFRIED’S HOTEL - TAXI - DAWN

The taxi pulls up on a broad street in front of a hotel It’s already getting light Toni
gets out and walks towards the building A few people are already making their way
to work He takes out the false teeth and puts them in his pocket
INT - WINFRIED’S HOTEL - BEDROOM - DAY

Winfried stands in a small hotel room His things are lying on the unused half of a
double bed He stands there for a moment bewildered then he leaves the hotel
again

EXT - BUCHAREST STREETS - DAY

It’s morning in Bucharest Winfried walks through the city He seems uncertain
about what he should do He takes his phone from his pocket and dials a number
No-one picks up He watches as commuters get onto buses

EXT - STREET BY BAKERY - DAY

Winfried stops by a bakery which sells its wares through a glass window He joins

the line and points at a couple of soft pretzels Then he sits down in a doorway and
eats Once again he takes his phone from his pocket and dials No-one picks up An
elderly woman passes by and begs at him Winfried quickly stands up

EXT - STREET IN FRONT OF INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

Winfried turns onto Ines’ street

INT - INES’ APARTMENT BLOCK - STAIRWELL - DAY

Winfried now half-Toni stands with a bag from the bakery in the darkened
stairwell in front of Ines’ door He hesitantly rings the bell She doesn’t answer He
rings again and listens He pulls Ines’ apartment key from his pocket and unlocks the
door

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

It’s quiet in the apartment He peers into Ines’ bedroom - the bed is empty
Suddenly he hears a noise from the bathroom He opens the door of a large built-in
closet in the hallway and wedges himself in still holding the bag from the bakery
Ines exits the bathroom She’s wearing her work clothes again She walks past the
closet notices that the door is slightly ajar and tries to close it Something’s in the
way She opens the closet and screams in mortal terror as she sees there’s a person
inside Toni peels himself out of the closet He is wearing his teeth but not the wig

TONI
Sorry I was just checking in on you
Ines gasps for air She’s speechless She runs at him and hits him with all her
strength He lets her do it for a moment then she flees into the kitchen Ines tries to
calm herself down but Toni follows her She reaches into a pot and throws the
remains of the old leftover spaghetti at Toni Suddenly Toni springs forward grabs
Ines’ wrist and fastens a handcuff to it

TONI
Ms Conradi you’re under arrest

They’re now chained together Ines tugs and pulls at her hand then very suddenly
she changes tack

INES
Open them up please I have an appointment I’m
about to be picked up

TONI
It’s too risky

Toni takes his handkerchief from his pants pocket and wipes the sweat from his
forehead He sits down on a chair and Ines has no choice but to go with him He
stalls a little longer then reaches into his pocket to get the key He searches but can’t
find it He carries on rummaging in his pockets

TONI (CONT’D)
I don’t have the key

Ines stares at him He looks at the handcuffs and confirms that they really are
locked

INES
Open them up right now

TONI
I really can’t find it

Ines looks down at herself She’s not fully dressed and her hair is wet She walks
away pulling on the handcuffs Toni has to hurry to keep up with her and suddenly
he seems like her captive

EXT - STREET IN FRONT OF INES’ APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY

Still handcuffed together Ines and Toni leave the house Bogdan the driver is
waiting for them

INES
Bogdan my father made a stupid joke We have
to solve this problem
Bogdan looks at the handcuffs and then nods Ines gets into the car Toni refuses

TONI
Iam not her father but OK Where are you
bringing me

INT - INES’ CAR - STREET NEAR MARKET - DAY

Toni and Ines sit on the back seat of the comfortable S-class car as Bogdan drives
them out of the city Ines tries to ignore Toni Both are still visibly feeling the effects
of the previous night Even though their hands are so close together they’re making
an effort not to touch The traffic edges tightly past run-down housing blocks

EXT - BUCHAREST MARKET - DAY

Ines and Toni follow Bogdan through the darkened halls of a sprawling market Toni
looks around but Ines forces him to hurry up At a stand selling household goods a
young ROMANIAN wearing a hoodie comes to their aid Discreetly and with
confident movements he separates the handcuffs Toni screams The Romanian
laughs Bogdan gives him some money

INT - INES’ CAR - FREEWAY - DAY

Using tape from the first-aid kit Ines sticks the handcuff to her arm so it’s not visible
under her blazer Toni looks out of the window The car hurtles along a freeway The
landscape is flat and empty In the distance an industrial area is visible Cattle stand
under hoardings advertising German companies Ines closes her eyes

INT - INES’ CAR - RURAL AREA - DAY

The landscape has changed Ines is asleep It’s a poor rural region They drive across
a bridge and overtake a horse-drawn cart Toni looks at it as they pass The car turns
onto an unpaved road Bogdan turns around towards the back seat

BOGDAN
(to Toni)
Please wake her up

Ines wakes up immediately and starts applying make-up
INTEXT - INES’ CAR - IN FRONT OF OILFIELD OFFICE - DAY

The car passes through a security checkpoint and drives into a fenced-off area They
pull up in front of the main building of an oilfield installation Ines gets out Toni
stretches planning to stay in the car Ines looks tensely at the building

INES
Come with me Take that off

Toni puts the toupee in his bag and follows her

INT - OILFIELD - LOBBY - ILLIESCU’S OFFICE - DAY
Ines and Toni enter an office lobby Ines greets a SECRETARY

INES
Good morning Conradi from Morrisons

SECRETARY
Please wait a minute

The secretary disappears and a moment later she opens the door to a large office
Ines ushers Toni in ahead of her

INT - OILFIELD - ILLIESCU’S OFFICE - DAY

The office is spacious and some effort has been made to mask the fact that it’s in the
sticks Toni has no choice but to follow Ines ILLIESCU a Romanian manager aged
around 50 greets Ines He’s surprised to see she’s arrived with company Ines
introduces him to Toni

INES
Mr Iliescu Mr Erdmann

The two men shake hands

INES (CONT’D)
Iam sorry for not getting in touch with you
earlier Mr Erdmann just joined NWG and as he
is on a visit together with Mr Henneberg he
wanted to get a personal impression of our
project

Ines looks at Toni who has no choice but to nod The secretary puts a couple of cans
of cola down on the table In his short-sleeved shirt Illiescu seems more like a labor
union type As an adversary he’s difficult to read He and Ines come from different
worlds
INES (CONTD)
Mr Erdmann implemented a similar project in
one of the major Russian oil companies

Toni nods at Illiescu and starts to feel his way into his role He leans back

ILLESICU
So please have a seat How can I help you

INES
He just wants to listen get a feeling for how we
work together on this project

Ines takes some out some papers and lays them in front of Illiescu

INES (CONT’D)
So first of all 1am looking forward that the
project is going to continue

ILLIESCU
SoamIsoaml

INES
And that we will work together much closer than
we have so far

ILLIESCU
Which is a pleasure

INES
As you know I presented your figures in our last
steering committee Unfortunately a lot of
questions came up about some of the data you
provided

She looks at Toni seeking his agreement He nods

INES (CONTD)
I defended your work since I know that the
things we ask you to deliver are complicated
considering the fact that you are a very busy
man

ILLIESCU
I’m surprised to hear that there are problems
Mr Tamaric is in Bucharest today

Every now and again Illiescu looks at Toni He is equally unable to read him Ines’
polished self-presentation is also something he doesn’t encounter every day Toni
senses that Illiescu is being put under pressure The more he grasps the situation
the more uncomfortable he too feels

INES
It doesn’t matter I wanted to talk to you
personally It’s a complicated business case
Because of that we have to decide if you have the
capacity to work closer with us Or if you prefer
we can send some of our consultants to work
here in your office

ILLIESCU
No I don’t think that is necessary

Ines turns to Toni

INES
I’d also prefer to try it this way Mr Erdmann
Mr Illiescu and I have known each other for
some time now and I think we will find a very
good solution

She’s acting as if it’s Toni who’s been piling on the pressure and she’s now the one
defending their collaboration with Iliescu For a moment no-one speaks

TONI
(in German)
OK If you think so

ILLIESCU
Just tell me what you need

He looks more closely at the list

INES
We particularly need the monthly personnel
costs in logistics by the end of next week Plus
we should think about doing a new future
manpower plan

ILLIESCU
I have to check don’t know why you don’t
have that already I will take care of it personally

INES
Thank you so much
ILLIESCU
(to Toni)
Anything more you want to know or see

INES
Maybe Mr Erdmann could get a personal
impression of the production

INT - ILLIESCU’S CAR - VILLAGE STREET NEAR OILFIELD - DAY

Toni sits next to Iliescu in his spacious company SUV The car drives through a
village turns onto an unpaved road and slowly struggles up the hill The landscape
becomes more barren There are houses a graveyard and an old orthodox church
Behind them oil pumps appear The oilfield extends right to the edge of the village

INT - ILLIESCU’S CAR - ROAD TO OILFIELD BOREHOLE - DAY

The car drives slowly across the rough terrain Goats walk around between the oil
pumps Toni looks out of the window

TONI
Same like in Russia

Outside a chaotic array of oil pumps stretches as far as the eye can see The drilling
seems like an infestation of the otherwise beautiful hilly landscape Iliescu makes a
detour to take them past a new oil pump

ILLIESCU
This is one of our newest pumps

Toni nods Iliescu pulls up in front of a small hut Filthy dogs lie in the shade Two
sunburned SECURITY GUARDS come outside Illiescu rolls down his window and
shakes hands with them

ILLESICU
(in Romanian)
Alo alo Avem nevoie de casti Avem ceva
musafiri de la Bucuresti (Hello We need hard
hats We have guests from Bucharest)

Hard hats are passed into the car and Iliescu drives onwards towards a borehole

ILLIESCU
This is a part of our maintenance crew We are
closing this drilling site
EXT - OILFIELD - BOREHOLE - DAY

A GROUP OF WORKERS is in the middle of repairing some part of a pump Ines
Illiescu and Toni get out of the car A couple of the workers approach them curious
about the visit They seem to be glad of the change Illiescu introduces Toni toa
WORKER who is clearly in charge of the operation Again the word “Bucharest” is
mentioned Toni confidently shakes the man’s hand and straightens his hard hat

ILLIESCU
It’s the last of the drill holes that we will close
We use an artificial lift system and hope to finish
it by the end of the week

Illiescu seems to be seizing the opportunity to demonstrate the quality of their
maintenance work to Ines Toni looks around and walks on towards the borehole
For a moment he jokingly inspects an old pipe that’s lying around then he goes
back to trying to make a professional impression Illiescu has followed him to see
what he’s so interested in A WORKER is busy repairing something with his bare
hands His lower arms are completely covered in oil Toni shakes his head and
points at the worker

TONI
But this is not good

Illiescu notices this right away and angrily reprimands the worker

ILLIESCU
(in Romanian)
Unde-ti sunt manusile de protectie Asta nue
reparatie auto ce faci tu aci (Where are your
protective gloves Youre not repairing your car)

WORKER
Nu pot lucra altfel (I can’t repair it any other
way)

ILLIESCU

Atunci sa faca altul care poate (Then let
someone else do it who can)

The worker defends himself Toni can’t understand the exchange

TONI
(to Illiescu)
Please don’t fire him

ILLIESCU
I will I will
TONI
No I said don’t fire him

ILLIESCU
But I will
(to the worker in Romanian)
iti risti locu’ de munca M-ai inteles (You are
risking your job Do you understand me)

Toni turns to Ines

TONI

(quietly)
Please can you just tell him not to fire that man

or something

INES
That’s up to him The more he fires the fewer I
have to fire
(BEAT)
Come on that was pretty funny

They look at each other

TONI
(to Illiescu)
Please it was just a joke

ILLESICU
But you are right He knows our security
standards

Illiescu approaches the FOREMAN and talks to him in the background

ILLIESCU
(in Romanian)
E raspunderea ta (It’s your responsibility)

FOREMAN
(in Romanian)
Numai acuma nu si le-a pus Totdeauna isi pune
manusi Am eu grija (It’s just for this job He
always wears gloves I will take care of it)

Ines watches Toni as he walks towards the car
EXT - OILFIELD - GARDEN - OUTSIDE HOUSE - DAY

Toni stands still next to the car He is visibly exhausted Some distance away there’s
a rickety garden fence He glances at Ines and Iliescu who are standing at the
borehole some distance away He walks through a broken gate looking for a place
to pee This part of the property is overgrown A sudden calm descends Crickets
chirp Just as Toni’s about to unfasten his pants he hears a voice and turns around

An ELDERLY MAN walks towards him and greets him in Romanian Toni lifts his
arms apologetically A TEENAGE BOY appears The man gestures at Toni to go ahead
and pee Winfried refuses

ELDERLY MAN
(in Romanian)
Haideti cu mine Sunteti de la Dacoil (Come
with me Are you from Dacoil)

Toni doesn’t understand him The man beckons for Toni to follow him They walk a
short distance further into a beautiful garden Flowers bloom A very modest house
appears Parts of it are covered in tarpaulin and renovation work appears to have
ground to a halt The man opens a door and beckons Toni inside Toni follows him
up a small set of wooden steps

INT - OILFIELD - HOUSE - VESTIBULE - DAY

They’re standing in a small vestibule full of clothes and buckets in which food is
stored Toni is about to walk further into the house when the man points to a toilet
He hands Toni a roll of toilet paper and Toni realizes what’s on offer On the lid of
the toilet is a picture of a tiger Toni points at it and makes a hissing noise as if the
tiger’s biting him The man laughs Toni nods gratefully and the man closes the door
behind him Exhausted Toni sits down on the toilet lid in the semi-darkness It has a
seat but it’s really just a pit latrine

EXT - OILFIELD - OUTSIDE HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

Toni walks back through the garden to the fence where the man now stands with
the boy Illiescu and Ines

ELDERLY MAN
(in Romanian)
Germania (Germany)

ILLIESCU
(in Romanian)
Da au venit pentru o modernizare (Yes they’re
going to modernize)
(in English to Ines and Toni)
I said you are going to modernize everything

The man nods respectfully at Ines and Toni Toni pulls out his wallet and holds a
twenty-euro bill towards the man

WINFRIED
Only euros

The man refuses He doesn’t want to take the money Winfried offers it to the
teenager who quickly puts the bill away

TEENAGE BOY
Thank you

ELDERLY MAN
(in Romanian)
Adu-i niste mere (Get him a few apples)

The boy disappears Illiescu turns to leave but the man starts talking to him He also
addresses Toni even though he can’t understand

ELDERLY MAN (CONT’D)
(in Romanian)
Ar trebui sa platiti mai bine Stiu cat ii dais lei
Popescu (You should pay much more know
what you pay Popescu)

ILLIESCU
(in Romanian)
Pai pe terenul lui avem o sonda Zi mersi ca-ti
dam cat iti dam (We have a drilling site on his
land Be happy that we pay as much as we do)

Illiescu abruptly tries to end the discussion and again turns to leave The boy
returns with a bag full of apples and gives them to Winfried One apple falls to the
ground and the man puts it in Winfried’s jacket pocket Winfried laughs gratefully
and gives the man a quick friendly pat on the shoulder

TONI
Don’t lose humor

The man looks questioningly at Illiescu

TONI (CONT’D)
Please translate
ILLIESCU
Nu va pierdeti umorul (Don’t lose your sense of
humor)
(in English)
I translated

When it’s repeated the sentence suddenly just sounds empty Ines is irritated by her
father’s philanthropy The old man laughs briefly revealing his few remaining teeth
They walk back to the car

ILLIESCU (CONT’D)
We give him some money every month but he
still complains He wants a pump on his land He
doesn’t understand that we don’t need his
ground This area is mostly empty

Illiescu shrugs not without regret

INT - INES’ CAR - RURAL AREA - ROAD TO FREEWAY - DAY

Toni and Ines sit in the back seat of her car They drive through villages that have
died out

INES
Don’t lose your sense of humor I couldn’t believe
you told them not to lose their sense of humor
That’s really cruel

TONI

(quietly)
It wasn’t about that It was a nice encounter

INES
He could really have used your teeth

Ines opens the center console and takes out a beer The car turns back onto the
freeway to Bucharest and accelerates

INES (CONT’D)
How can we modernize that whole place if you
pee your pants when only one of them is fired
(BEAT)
With every step you take I can tell you how
direct your economic connection is to these
people Your pseudo-green attitude won’t help
you there at all
Ines takes a gulp of beer Toni looks silently out of the window

TONI

(quietly)
Take a short break please

He closes his eyes and after a moment he starts breathing very calmly Suddenly
Ines no longer seems sure about what she just said She rips off the tape she was
using to hide the handcuff under her sleeve and leans back She observes her father
His hand gently clenched in a fist encloses the case for his reading glasses It
already has some age spots Ines slumps down and can no longer keep her eyes
open

INT - INES’ CAR - ROAD TO FLAVIA’S HOUSE - DAY

The car drives through the outskirts of Bucharest Apartment blocks alternate with
art nouveau buildings The car turns onto a dark side street Bogdan looks outside
searching He turns around to Toni who’s also awake and looking out of the
window He’s once again wearing the toupee with the long hair

BOGDAN
It’s here

TONI
OK Thank you

He gropes for his reading glasses and looks at a business card Ines is sleeping
slouched on the seat next to him

BOGDAN
Shall I drive her home

TONI
Yes
EXT - STREET BY FLAVIA’S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE - DAY

Toni gets out of the car He hesitates for a moment then approaches the apartment

What is this place

Toni presses the buzzer Bogdan joins them and gives Toni the bag of apples which
he’d left behind A voice emanates from the intercom
VOICE
(in Romanian)

There’s a buzz and Toni pushes the door open Ines looks at him tiredly Toni
disappears into a darkened hallway Just before the door swings closed Ines reaches
for it and follows Toni inside

Toni notices that Ines has followed him She hesitates again by the elevator

INES
Let’s stop this now Dad

Nonetheless she gets into the elevator The doors close and Toni presses a button
They travel upwards Exhausted Toni and Ines look at themselves in a small mirror

INT - FLAVIA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - LANDING - APARTMENT - DAY

The door to an apartment stands ajar Noises drift out from within A CHILD peers
around the door and shortly afterwards DORINA a pretty elderly woman with curly
red hair and a dramatic outfit appears

DORINA
Buna (Hello)

TONI
Hello Erdmann Ms Schnuck my secretary

The woman beckons them inside She gestures at a coat rack but Toni and Ines have
nothing to hang up Toni holds the bag of apples like a gift

DORINA
Flavia

Dorina disappears along a long corridor Toni and Ines stay behind The sound of a
family gathering reaches them

INES
Please let’s go

Flavia the woman whose plate Toni held at the party appears at the end of the
corridor and walks towards them Toni gives Ines the bag of apples to hold
FLAVIA
Oh hello You really came

She’s genuinely surprised by the visitors

TONI
Spontaneous decision Only if we don’t make
problems

FLAVIA

No Sorry for my sister

TONI
Ms Schnuck You already know her Some
apples from the embassy’s garden

Toni gestures at Ines who has no choice but to offer the apples to Flavia

FLAVIA
Thank you

Flavia looks at Ines and Toni trying to work out what’s going on with them

FLAVIA (CONT’D)
Please come in

TONI
(mixing German and English)
I dreamed had diese Vision von einem Ei How
I would paint my egg My Easter egg

He turns to Ines

TONI (CONT’D)
(to Ines)
Please translate

INES
He had this vision of how he would paint an
Easter egg

FLAVIA

Oh I see Please come in

Ines requires extra persuasion
INT - FLAVIA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Flavia leads the strange guests into a packed living room Numerous family
members are lounging with the children on a corner sofa eating and watching TV
It’s not clear whether it’s a family party or the preparations for such a party Flavia
quickly beckons Ana over She’s the young woman who was with her at the
headhunting company’s party

FLAVIA
(to Ana)
You remember Mr Erdmann from the party

ANA
Yes hello

Ana nods in surprise and looks at Toni a little warily Suddenly Winfried feels
uncomfortable Ines smiles politely at Ana and again resists the urge to leave

FLAVIA
Do you want a coffee or a tea
TONI
Oh yes that would be great
INES
Just a water
FLAVIA
We didn’t paint Bukowina eggs But we can show
you some
TONI
OK

Flavia beckons to her sister Dorina the woman who opened the apartment door for
Ines and Toni

FLAVIA

(in Romanian)
Dorina dansul este un amic care lucreaz la
Ambasada Germaniei iar doamna Schnuck este
secretara dansului Vor si ei sa Invete tehnica
incondeierii Le arati tu te rog (Dorina this is
Mr Erdmann We met at Ana’s company’s party
He works in the German embassy and wants to
know a bit about the Bukowina technique)
DORINA
OK

FLAVIA
(to Toni)
My sister will explain to you

Flavia guides them to a table On it lie some eggs which have been painted by
children

TONI
Wow this is very beautiful

ANA
No no we just did it with the children

Flavia quickly fetches a box from a shelf and takes out a couple of eggs Ana switches
on a strange little oven

ANA (CONT’D)
The wax should be hot soon

Flavia comes over with the box Dorina helps her They take out a couple of very
traditional-looking eggs No-one really seems to know why the strange guests are
specifically interested in the eggs but Dorina explains in Romanian anyway before
Ana translates into English

ANA (CONTD)
(in English)
In the first step you paint a pattern with wax on
the egg After that the egg will be put in the color
bath So under the wax it stays white

TONI
Translation please Ms Schnuck

INES
(in German)
The first step is to paint the egg with a wax
pattern Then it’s dipped into a dye bath and
colored The bit under the wax remains white

Flavia comes back carrying two aprons

TONI
Shall I help in the kitchen
FLAVIA
No because of the colors I thought you want to
try

TONI
(mixing German and English)
Yes gerne

Toni lets them tie the apron around him Ines politely declines

FLAVIA
Please sit down

Flavia points to two chairs Amongst the children’s eggs Dorina and Ana find the
one remaining white egg

ANA
There is only one left

Dorina checks the oven which is now hot Ines hides her impatience There’s no way
she can escape from the situation without seeming impolite

FLAVIA
I will bring the coffee

Toni sits down Dorina demonstrates painting something onto the egg using a
pointed tool Dorina continues in Romanian handing the tool to Toni while Ana
translates

ANA
With this tool you put the wax on the egg It’s
complicated

TONI
Ms Schnuck

Ines translates unwillingly

INES
(in German)
Now you use it to paint something on the egg

Toni paints a crooked dripping line of wax onto the egg Flavia arrives with two
cups of coffee and pieces of cake Toni hands the egg to Ines along with the tool

TONI
It’s your turn now

Ines reluctantly sits down
TONI
(in German)
And take a few notes please

He takes the cake and follows Flavia into the living room

TONI (CONT’D)
And Orthodox Easter is when

FLAVIA
On Friday But we come together before On
Easter everybody is at their own home

TONI
Thank you that we can be here The cake is
good

Toni looks at Ines who’s being shown how to dip the egg in the dye bath She sits
between the two women exhausted and deep in thought and lets the Romanian
explanations wash over her

TONI (CONT’D)
(to Flavia)
We just came from the countryside We visited
an oilfield

FLAVIA
Oh really

Ines looks at her father and Flavia The latter is now reprimanding a YOUNG BOY for
irksomely hitting the keys of a keyboard All of a sudden Ines stands up

INES
(to Ana)
Iam sorry I really have to leave now It was very
interesting

She walks over to Toni and Flavia

INES (CONT’D)
(in German)
I’m going now
(to Flavia)
I have to go 1 am so sorry

TONI
Can we play a song for you just to say thank
you We always do that
FLAVIA
OK why not

TONI
(in German)
For once let’s finish something politely

He sits down at the keyboard and starts playing He repeats an intro phrase

TONI (CONT’D)
Mes dames et messieurs mon secretary and I
want to play a song for you Over twenty years
ago she started to force me to play this song
over and over

He looks at Ines She shakes her head

TONI (CONT’D)
Please give an applause to the fantastic
Whitney Schnuck

A few people clap Toni repeats the intro again and again as if he’s waiting for her
We recognize it as the start of Whitney Houston’s “The Greatest Love of All” The
guests look expectantly at Ines The pressure builds Ines looks at Flavia who gives
her a friendly smile She finds the courage to take a few steps forward Once again

Toni starts playing “The Greatest Love of All” She starts to sing

INES
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside

Ines deliberately starts warbling in a slightly exaggerated way

INES (CONTD)
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children’s laughter remind us how we used
to be

The guests however remain serious and the song becomes too complicated for
Ines’ performance to stay ironic She has to focus on staying in tune and
remembering the lyrics She’s too ambitious to let herself sing badly She’s seized by
her anger towards Toni and she wants to show him she can do this

INES (CONTD)
Everybody’s searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

Ines glances at her father He’s trying to accompany her well Ines starts to sing
louder

INES (CONTD)
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone’s
shadow
If I fail if I succeed
At least I lived as I believed
No matter what they take from me They can’t take
away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me

A couple of family members start to shout encouragement They seem to think it’s
good that something unplanned is happening

INES (CONTD)
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

She wants to bring the song to a close but Toni keeps playing She joins in again and
sings even more intensively than before

INES (CONTD)
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children’s laughter remind us how we used
to be

The lyrics repeat at a more difficult pitch and the tempo picks up

INES (CONTD)
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone’s
shadow
If I fail if I succeed
At least I lived as I believed
No matter what they take from me
They can’t take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me

She struggles with the difficult song but rage carries her through The guests have
now fallen silent

INES (CONTD)
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
Is the greatest love of all
And if by chance that special place
That you have been dreaming of Leads you to a
lonely place
Find your strength in love

The song is over Ines flees the room The family of strangers claps Toni gets up and
follows her

INT - FLAVIA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - STAIRWELL - LANDING - DAY

Ines has already descended the stairs For a moment Toni thinks about going after
her but misses his chance Exhausted he sits down on the stairs He takes out the
false teeth He’s surrounded by several houseplants The apartment has grown out
into the hallway He reaches into his grocery bag and pulls out his pillbox He hasn’t
taken any pills for days He puts the box away again A mask on the wall catches his
eye It’s a large black furry head with a colorful bauble Flavia accompanies two
FRIENDS to her door and sees Toni sitting alone in the hallway

FLAVIA
Everything OK You can play very well

TONI
What is this

FLAVIA
A mask from Bulgaria Do you want to stay for
dinner

He looks at his watch

TONI
(mixing German and English)
Oh yes why not The embassy is sowieso closed
now
He shrugs at his bad joke Flavia sits down next to him They sit calmly next to each
other

TONI (CONT’D)
You know I am not the German ambassador

FLAVIA
Yes know the German ambassador

Toni can’t help but laugh

TONI
I’m so sorry All this was fun I am on holidays
Visiting Ms Schnuck She is my daughter I came
to see how it is here how she lives but it was
very complicated

FLAVIA
I know family

Flavia nods her head towards the apartment They look at each other

INT - INES’ APARTMENT BLOCK - STAIRWELL - APARTMENT - DAY

Ines arrives at her apartment door Three PARTY SERVICE EMPLOYEES have carried
everything to the door Ines lets them in and stands disorientated in her apartment
She watches as two men and a young woman from the party service company put
together a round dinner table hang up floral decorations and methodically load
things into her refrigerator Ines makes an effort to decide where everything should

go

PARTY SERVICE WOMAN
Please be careful with the flammable liquid and
we marked the wasabi sauce It’s super spicy

INES
Thank you so much It looks incredibly good

PARTY SERVICE WOMAN
We will bring the rest tomorrow And if you have
any questions this is our emergency hotline
Thank you for choosing Dariu’s Catering

The woman hands Ines a card

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Ines lies motionless in her bed Her cellphone beeps She seems to be receiving
birthday greetings She listens to a voice message and we hear faintly as her mother
and Gerhard sing “Happy Birthday” and send her their best wishes She hangs up
before the message is finished

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - KITCHENLIVING ROOM - DAY

Ines walks from her bedroom into the kitchen She’s blow-dried her hair and pinned
it up and she’s wearing a chic tight-fitting dress Its zipper isn’t quite closed She
stands perplexed in front of the buffet then adjusts a couple of items She gropes for
the label that’s still hanging from her dress and rips it off She takes out a fork
threads its prongs into the zipper on the back of her dress and pulls it up She takes
a bowl of fruit from the refrigerator and walks into the living room Everything’s in
place for a casual buffet party The food looks very expensive She adjusts a few
things and then walks back into the hallway She glances into the mirror in the guest
bathroom She fixes her hair The overly-tight dress is irritating her

INT - APARTMENT - HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - BEDROOM - DAY

Ines takes a pair of shoes from the closet in the hall and puts them on She has to
hitch up her tight dress before she can reach the shoes Their straps are difficult to
fasten She walks back into the bedroom and looks at some other clothes that are
laid out on the bed She tries to take off the dress but fails She can no longer reach
the zipper She pulls the dress upwards but that only works incrementally The
doorbell rings Ines struggles to take off the dress She pulls it aggressively upwards
and gradually fights her way out - it envelops her like a straitjacket The doorbell
rings again She walks into the hallway hesitates briefly then goes ahead and opens
the door She’s naked apart from a pair of flesh-colored underpants Steph stands
outside and looks at her with bemusement Ines straightens up surprised at her
own courage

STEPH
Am I too early

INES
No no come in

Steph gives Ines a gift which she distractedly takes

INES (CONTD)
Thank you

Steph walks into the living room She’s surprised by Ines’ nakedness but decides to
ignore it Instead she comments on the buffet
STEPH
Wow this is really nice

INES
Yes I was very happy with Dariu’s They were
really nice I mean it’s a super small event

STEPH
Yes he is the best

INES
(in German)
Do you want
(switching to English)
Ah do you want to drink What do you want to
drink Crémant or a Sancerre

STEPH
Sancerre

Ines walks tensely to the refrigerator fetches the Sancerre wine and pours Steph a
glass

STEPH (CONTD)
Who is coming

INES
Basically my team from the office

STEPH
Great New people

Steph is now slowly starting to feel uncomfortable about the nudity Ines tries to
open the gift but that doesn’t work She puts it down again Steph picks up the gift
and tries to open it herself The doorbell rings

STEPH (CONTD)
Iam also a last minute girl Shall I help you
choose something I bet your closet is bursting

INES
No thank you

She looks out of the window She waits a little too long before she turns around The
doorbell rings again

STEPH
OK I open the door and you get dressed
INES
No it’s OK

Ines takes off her underpants and walks to the door Realizing that she’s really going
to open it Steph quickly retreats into the living room Gerald stands outside It takes
a moment for him to realize with shock that Ines is naked He shrinks back He’s
holding a bottle of champagne

INES (CONTD)
Nothing’s wrong Gerald I just have nothing on

GERALD
OK

INES
It’s a a naked party

Ines stands up straight She’s struggling to stick by her assertion Gerald laughs
nervously and tries to catch a glimpse into the apartment

GERALD
Interesting OK

INES
It’s part of the team building Stupid idea but I
couldn’t think of anything better off the top of
my head

GERALD
(uncertainly)
I know that kind of thing from college Isn’t ita
bit childish

INES
You don’t have to join in Ring the bell if you
change your mind

Ines reaches into the apartment and hands Gerald a paper bag for his clothes Then
she closes the door and turns to Steph who’s appeared behind her in the hallway
Ines walks back into the living room and gives Steph a questioning look She’s trying
to hide the fact that she’s not totally convinced but instead she sticks with her
assertion

INES (CONTD)
What are we going to do with you now

STEPH
I’m definitely not undressing here
INES
Iam sorry but then you have to go

STEPH
You are kidding

Ines shakes her head Steph pointedly puts down her glass and slowly walks to the
door She appears to be re-considering Ines follows her still naked It almost seems
like she’s throwing Steph out Steph opens the door and at that moment Tim steps
out of the elevator Steph takes the stairs and mutters

STEPH (CONTD)
Have fun you two

Tim is surprised at first to see Ines naked He glances bemusedly in Steph’s
direction

TIM
Hey am I early

INES
No it’s a naked party

TIM
OK

INES

Gerald had the idea He knows this kind of thing
from college To strengthen the team spirit

TIM
Haha
INES
I’m being serious
TIM
And who’s already here
INES
No-one
TIM

Yeah I know for sure they’re all in there and Ill
be the only one who walks in naked Call me
when the joke’s over

They look at each other a little too long then Tim leaves and Ines closes the door
She walks into the bedroom glances at her clothes once more and flops onto the
bed She lies there quietly for what seems like forever After a while the doorbell
rings Ines can’t bring herself to open it Her cellphone rings She looks at the caller
ID and sees that it’s Anca but she doesn’t answer Someone knocks at the door this
time with more urgency Ines looks through the spyhole and then hurriedly opens
the door

INT - INES’ APARTMENT - DAY

Anca Ines’ assistant stands naked outside the door clutching her clothes to her
body and smiling shyly

INES
Hello

She quickly slips into the apartment

ANCA
Happy birthday
She shakes Ines’ hand
ANCA (CONT’D)

(quietly)
But it’s not about sex

Ines shakes her head and for a moment she’s truly overwhelmed by her naked
guest Anca is skinny and has a girlish figure

INES
No no

ANCA
OK So it’s just as a challenge

Ines nods quickly and it dawns on her that she’s still wearing a bathrobe She takes
it off She beckons Anca into the living room

ANCA (CONT’D)
Am I the first

INES
Yes

Anca relaxes a little but finds it strange that there’s no-one else there She pulls Ines’
blouse and a gift from her bag

ANCA
(in German)
Unfortunately it didn’t completely wash out

INES
Oh thanks That’s no problem at all

ANCA
Here’s your present

Ines unwraps the present and pulls outa cute little pocket calculator

ANCA (CONT’D)
Because you always ask for mine

INES
Thank you

For amoment Ines is moved by the gift

ANCA
(in English)
Is everything OK

INES
Yes

ANCA
At the office you are always so stiff and now you
come up with this

Even though Anca’s playing along she clearly finds the whole thing strange She
looks around the apartment

ANCA (CONT’D)
You like it here
INES
Yes
ANCA
That’s good
INES
Why
ANCA

Because I searched so long

INES
Oh I didn’t know
The doorbell rings Anca straightens up nervously Ines looks at her Now she really
has to hold a naked party She walks to the door

ANCA
Where is the bathroom

Ines points to the guest bathroom in the hallway Anca disappears Ines hesitates for
a moment at the door The bell rings again and she opens up She gets the fright of
her life A dark animal-like figure a KUKERI stands outside His whole body is
covered in long dark fur and his head is like a tall shaggy tower In one hand he
holds a flowering shrub that’s been ripped from the ground It’s difficult to say
whether he looks creepy or friendly Ines hides behind the door The creature
hesitates for a moment then shuffles cumbersomely into the apartment It’s not
until he’s halfway inside that he realizes Ines is naked He stops and hesitates He
gives her the plant (a bouquet of artificial flowers) and doesn’t know whether to
continue into the apartment Ines isn’t sure who’s inside the costume Anca
cautiously exits the guest bathroom expecting to see a colleague She screams and
stares at the Kukeri The Kukeri notices her with surprise He’s now in the company
of two naked women He makes as if to leave He seems to find the situation
suspicious He moves towards Anca who quickly retreats to safety

ANCA (CONT’D)
What is this Who is under it

INES
I don’t know

ANCA
(in German)
But not Gerald

INES
I don’t know Honest

Anca doesn’t really believe Ines because it could be another part of the team-
building exercise

INES (CONTD)
(in German)
Are you Gerald

The Kukeri shakes his head uncertainly - as if he too is wondering who he is Ines is
also uncertain The Kukeri’s dark fur creates a sinister impression The costume is
striking Nothing about it suggests that there’s a person inside Anca tries to use her
handbag to cover herself a little The doorbell rings again Anca hides behind a
column Ines has no choice but to walk to the door again and open it Gerald stands
outside wearing an earnest expression He’s clutching his clothes to his crotch He’s
still wearing his socks and shoes
GERALD
Had a beer first

He looks questioningly at Ines

GERALD (CONT’D)
Come in

INES
Ah yes

Gerald takes baby steps into the living room He greets Anca with a nod For her
Gerald’s nakedness is far more difficult to deal with than her own Gerald is still
hiding his genitals with his clothes The Kukeri has retreated into a corner right
behind Gerald and stands there motionless Gerald doesn’t notice him He looks at
Ines awaiting further instructions

GERALD
(to Ines)
And now Totally naked Or what’s this about

Ines nods vaguely As if carrying out a dare Gerald puts his clothes to one side Fora
moment he just stands there naked He still doesn’t notice the Kukeri standing
behind him Suddenly the Kukeri puts its paw on Gerald’s shoulder from behind
Gerald screams and fends it off The Kukeri briefly throttles him then lets him go

GERALD (CONT’D)
Hard-core Hard-core

He turns around and stares at the monster that attacked him He gives the Kukeri a
friendly pat on the back as if there’s some coach inside the costume As far as he’s
concerned the whole thing was clearly pre-planned Anca laughs with her hand in
front of her mouth

GERALD (CONT’D)
That’s awesome How did you come up with this
kind of nonsense

He walks to the Kukeri and gropes at it The Kukeri playfully grabs Gerald’s neck for
a moment

GERALD (CONT’D)
He can’t take a joke

Gerald walks to Anca and holds up his open hand She doesn’t understand at first
but then gives him a high-five He does the same thing with Ines

GERALD (CONT’D)
Where did you get it
ANCA
I think it’s Bulgarian Something against the evil
spirits

GERALD
Good for the team
(in German)
What a load of nonsense Awesome

Gerald reaches uncertainly for his underpants and hurriedly pulls them back on
Anca also disappears with relief into the bathroom Gerald looks at the buffet The
Kukeri sits down weakly for a moment on the edge of the sofa His head is crooked
giving him a sad appearance He straightens it with his paws

GERALD (CONT’D)
OK now Ive earned a bite to eat Wow you’ve
really gone to town

The Kukeri cumbersomely stands up and staggers to the door

GERALD (CONT’D)
Now he’s leaving already

Ines watches him The door swings closed Ines looks distractedly at the brunch
Anca exits the bathroom fully dressed

INES
Yeah and this is salmon with lemon remoulade
Just serve yourselves Guys I have to pay that
guy quickly

Ines grabs a bathrobe walks out of the apartment into the darkened hallway and
runs down the stairs Her colleagues CORNELIU and DARIU are just arriving Ines
excuses herself and points them towards her apartment

EXT - STREET BY INES’ APARTMENT - NEAR UNIRII SQUARE - DAY

Ines sees the Kukeri turn a corner and runs after him She spots him again Still
wearing the full costume he simply walks on A couple of PASSERS-BY turn around
to look at him Others pay him no heed The sun hangs low and bathes the street in
warm light Ines follows the Kukeri in her bathrobe expecting him to take off his
head

EXT - PARK - UNIRII SQUARE - EVENING

The Kukeri crosses a large town square Huge illuminated advertising hoardings
appear Were in the middle of the city The Kukeri stops and stands by a kiosk He
makes as if to remove the head but then doesn’t Ines catches up with him She
continues to follow him without him seeing her Exhausted the Kukeri briefly sits
down on a bench Two TEENAGERS take a photo of him A YOUNG GIRL approaches
him and strokes his fur He briefly puts a paw on her head Then he stands up The
attention is too much for him He walks away through a few bushes into the center
of the park Ines watches as he moves further away She can’t stand it anymore
Suddenly she starts running

INES
Dad

The Kukeri turns around Ines sinks into his wiry fur and appears to shrink The
Kukeri returns the embrace and Ines holds onto him as if she never wants to let go
again The Kukeri holds her just as tightly his head resting heavily on her shoulder
After a while he lets go of her They look at each other for a moment Suddenly he
holds out his arms Ines screams in shock The Kukeri chases her for a few steps
then doubles back on himself For a moment he appears wild and energetic His fur
wafts in the breeze Then he tiredly raises his hand Ines turns and walks back
towards her apartment The Kukeri watches her Her bathrobe lifts in the wind and
briefly flashes her bare behind before she disappears As soon as she’s gone the
Kukeri staggers behind a bush He grabs at his head but can’t pull it off He begins to
lurch and slowly falls to his knees Again he grabs at his head but then he lies down
and breathes heavily He really doesn’t seem able to remove the head For a long
while he stays lying there Then seemingly using up his last reserves of strength he
sits up

EXT - STREETS AROUND UNIRII SQUARE - EVENING

The Kukeri crosses a large intersection For the first time we really see something of
the city There are lots of people around all going their own way The Kukeri looks
like a lonely alien

EXT - STREET BY WINFRIED’S HOTEL - NIGHT

The Kukeri turns onto a side street and disappears between a currency exchange
and an open-fronted florist’s into a small low-budget hotel called “Ambassador”

INT - WINFRIED’S HOTEL - RECEPTION - NIGHT

The Kukeri enters the hotel’s reception area A young CONCIERGE is absent-
mindedly watching a soccer match The Kukeri gestures at his head and mumbles
something incomprehensible The concierge understands what he means leans over
the reception desk and with a great deal of strength pulls off the Kukeri’s head
Winfried is pale His sweat-drenched hair sticks to his scalp The man puts the head
down on the desk and puts Winfried’s room key next to it Winfried breathes
heavily

EXT - FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

Winfried stands in front of an old building Through the entrance to a courtyard a
nondescript German street is visible It’s a clear somewhat autumnal day in late
summer Winfried is wearing a dark suit and his beard has grown longer WALTER
aman around the same age as Winfried waits with his WIFE who briefly
straightens his necktie IRMA a woman also around Winfried’s age is talking in the
background to two FUNERAL PARLOR EMPLOYEES

UNDERTAKER
Just let us know when the private part of the
ceremony is over

IRMA
Could we use your parking lot afterwards to load
up

UNDERTAKER
Of course

IRMA
Thanks Roberto could you take my bag fora
minute

She gives her handbag to ROBERTO a man of Mediterranean appearance and walks
towards a dolled-up WOMAN who’s approaching her

IRMA (CONT’D)
Winfried this is the singer

Winfried nods at the singer and takes a few steps in the other direction At the
entrance we see a taxi pull up Winfried watches as Ines and Renate get out They
open the trunk and take out a floral arrangement Winfried walks towards them
Ines approaches her father They embrace as closely as the flowers allow

WINFRIED
(mumbling)
A serious occasion

INES
Yes

WINFRIED
I’m glad youre here
Winfried takes the flowers from her

INES
How are you

WINFRIED
Okay

Winfried and Ines look at each other for a moment It’s clearly the first time they’ve
seen each other again Renate joins them and briefly embraces Winfried

RENATE
My sincere condolences

Renate briefly shakes hands with Walter and his wife Ines does the same

WINFRIED
The coffin is still open

INES
Oh

RENATE
Ill stay here

Ines follows her father surprised

INT - FUNERAL PARLORCHAPEL - DAY

A chapel is laid out with chairs It’s modern and quite small Referring to a booklet
Irma is explaining the order of service to the singer Winfried puts Ines’ flowers
down He shakes hands with the singer and gestures at her and Irma to leave them
alone for a moment Ines walks to the coffin in which her grandmother lies Irma is
now decorating something at the other end of the room - she’s trying not to bother
them but she is For a moment Winfried stays in the background then he sits down
next to Ines and looks at his mother She looks much smaller and strangely wax-like

INES
I’m sorry I didn’t see her again

WINFRIED
I think she understood that somehow

They sit there in silence

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
You can touch her if you like
Ines leans forward and touches Annegret’s wrinkled hand Winfried looks back at
Irma who’s giving them a nagging look

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
We have to go The line is long - they all still want
money from her

He stands up and briefly touches his mother’s cheek Irma turns to the funeral
parlor employees

IRMA
You can close the coffin now

The employees walk to the coffin lid to close it

INT - FUNERAL PARLOR CHAPEL - DAY

Ines sits in the chapel in the front row next to her mother Next to them are
Winfried’s sister Irma and a man Walter who appears to be Winfried’s brother A
young enthusiastic PASTOR brings his speech to a close Ines glances furtively at her
father The SINGER and her ACCOMPANIST step forward They begin to perform an
adapted highly theatrical version of “Time to Say Goodbye” by Sarah Brightman and
Andrea Bocelli Next to Winfried Irma starts to sob Winfrieds listens motionless
Its hard to say what he feels

INT - ANNEGRET’S HOUSE - KITCHENLIVING ROOMTERRACE - DAY

Ines walks through her grandmother’s house She peers into the kitchen in which
some of her relatives are washing up the cake plates

INES
Can I help you with anything

TABEA
It’s almost done thanks

Ines looks out through the terrace window Outside Winfried is talking with Walter
and BENJAMIN The men are holding bottles of beer A couple of GRANDCHILDREN
are doing gymnastics on a swing seat and being reprimanded by their MOTHER
Irma stands in front of an open sideboard

IRMA
(to Ines)
If there’s anything youre attached to let us
know Benjamin’s making a list
INES
Yes I’ll think about it

Ines walks outside and joins Winfried and Walter

WALTER
And where are you these days Budapest

She ignores his mistake

INES
Bucharest but I just finished there Now I’m
going to Singapore for two years

She looks at Winfried It’s news to him

WALTER
They have the biggest whiskey bar in the world
there What are these companies called

INES
Youve probably heard of the new one McKinsey
I used to be with Morrisons

Irma appears at the terrace door

IRMA
Winfried can you come here

Winfried walks to the door and glances into the living room

WINFRIED (0S)
Just leave that there for now

Ines looks at him and their eyes meet Winfried gestures with his head for her to
follow him then disappears

INT - ANNEGRET’S HOUSE - CELLAR - GARDEN - DAY

Ines follows Winfried without understanding what he’s looking for here He
switches ona light and we see a scene of chaos left undisturbed for several years - a
dust-covered workbench a collection of antlers old guns furniture and carpets
Winfried picks something up and puts it down again He stands there at a loss He
sits down for a moment

WINFRIED
That song Irma’s crazy They were supposed to
play something by Harry Belafonte She liked
him even though it was negro music to her
He stands up and starts to rummage through the chaos and open up cupboards He
takes out old coats and puts them away again From under the hood ofa hair dryer
he pulls out a steel helmet Ines watches him He opens a door that leads to the
garden

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
All the things she kept No idea whose this is All
this stuff is genuine

He gestures at an open cupboard

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Full of hats

He takes out a suitcase which really is full of all kinds of hats Ines looks at them
Most are unused Some even still have the price tag Ines takes out a summer hat
with fruit ornaments She looks at Winfried as if she’s waiting for something from
him It’s the first time they’ve been alone together since Bucharest Winfried
hesitates for a moment then plucks up the courage to say something

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
About your question there in Bucharest about
life The problem is it’s so often about getting
things done And then you still have to do this or
that And in the meantime life just passes by
But how are we supposed to hang on to
moments Now I sometimes sit there and
remember how you learned to ride your bike or
how I once found you at a bus stop But you only
realize that afterwards In the moment itself it’s
not possible

He looks at her unsure what she thinks about what he’s said They’re silent for a
moment then Ines reaches out and checks the breast pocket of Winfried’s shirt She
pulls out the false teeth and puts them into her mouth Winfried looks at her
fascinated Ines puts on the hat with the fruit They look at each other

WINFRIED (CONT’D)
Wait Ill get my camera

He walks out of the door Ines follows him She watches as he disappears around the
corner of the house Just before he’s gone he turns around once more Ines waits at
the wall motionless Her expression turns serious She waits It’s taking too long
He’s not coming back

FADE OUT
