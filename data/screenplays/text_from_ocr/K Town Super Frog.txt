K-TOWN SUPER FROG
THE SOUND OF WIND BLOWING AND CLANGING
SLOW FADE UP ON
EXT BASEBALL DIAMOND - DUSK
WIDE SHOT

The baseball diamond is surrounded by a rusty chain-link
fence that clangs against itself

Weeds grow on the pitcher’s mound

The dilapidated dugout is tagged with layers of graffiti
Spray-painted in bright vivid colors are names and images
Discarded spray-paint cans lay under the dilapidated
bleachers

ANOTHER ANGLE

On the far side of the diamond is a burnt and rusted car
missing its wheels

A strong gust of desert wind clangs the chain-link fence
louder and whips up a small dust devil that sucks up trash

SLOW DISSOLVE TO
EXTREME CLOSE UP ON

An upsidedown eye (Briefly superimposed over the baseball
diamond )

The eye is closed but it’s moving around wildly under the
lid

Slow pull back from the eye revealing the second eye and the
upsidedown face of a young guy

KENGO YOSHIYA early 20’s half-Asian great looking but shy
and slightly goofy There is a wide-eyed openness in his
face

His eyes slowly blink open with a slow groan surveying the
surroundings of his room
KENGO’S POV

His upsidedown room blurry A small shaft of light streams
into the window Flecks of dust flicker around in the light
It’s the entire universe in miniature drifting around Kengo’s
room The rest of the room is out of focus

Kengo head hangs over the side of the bed His arm twisted
under him and his face squashed against the back of his
hand Obviously having passed out in this odd position He
takes a deep breath and blows The dust wildly dances through
the shaft Chaos Kengo smiles He drags his numb arm out
from under himself and lifts his head off his hand and the
hangover hits

KENGO
(in soft pain)
Oh fuck

There is a small black ink smudge on his cheek and a smeared
club re-entry stamp on the back of his hand Evidence of a
late night

In another room haunting traditional Asian folk music is
softly playing

INT KENGO’S ROOM - MORNING - WIDE

There would be a floor but it’s buried in layers of clothes
Art posters on the wall and several photos Kengo has taken of
his life Candid shots of people buildings There is a
large black and white photo of a young woman at the beach
(His girlfriend SANDRA)

There is a small collection of cameras on a shelf A tiny
Thai Buddha peers out from a shelf

A garbage truck rumbles by and shakes the room Kengo groans
suffering his hangover headache

KENGO’S POV
The light has shifted brushing across a large print of

Leonardo Da Vinci’s “THE ANNUNCIATION” It’s creased and
wrinkled but still haunting
CLOSE ON The angel It’s large wings are spread on its
knees informing Mary of her immaculate conception

KENGO
(to the angle)
Please God never do this to me
again

There is a soft knock at his door

WOMAN VOICE (EVELYN)
(softly)
Kengo

Kengo turns looks at his door as it cracks opens His head
throbs

KENGO
(quietly)
Ahhhhhh No
EVELYN late 30’s stands in his doorway upsidedown still
his POV She is beautiful wearing only her underwear a bra
and panties They don’t match and are a bit chaste to be
contemporary

Evelyn leans over sideways trying to make her head right-side-
up for Kengo

EVELYN
Rise and shine monkey of mine

Kengo groans With all the effort he has in the world he
pulls his head back onto the pillow

Right-side-up Evelyn is even more beautiful There is a
fragility and sadness about her She’s heartbreaking

Evelyn finds Kengo’s glasses hanging off a lamp and puts them
on She looks funny her eyes a little buggy now

Kengo pulls his pillow over his face
Evelyn walks across the room and slides the pillow off Kengo

He squints in the light
EVELYN
(whispering)
Move over

He hesitatingly moves over groaning

Evelyn lifts up the sheet and crawls into bed with Kengo
snuggling up next to him

Kengo drift back to unconsciousness He yawns
Evelyn gets a whiff of his breath She plugs her nose

EVELYN
Oh God The smell You smell like a
brewery No not a brewery a
distillery

She lightly rubs his chest
EVELYN
(whispering into his ear)
You got home very late last night

Actually it was very early in the
morning

Kengo groans again Drifting off
SLOW DISSOLVE TO

FLASHBACK

EXT THE BUILDINGS OF KOREA TOWN - NIGHT

For a moment the image of the buildings appear on the walls
of Kengo’s bedroom

Impressionistic dreamy shots of Korea Town at night
Traffic Neon

The great old 1920’s buildings and the glass office towers
built in the ‘70s The huge video monitor near the corner of
Wilshire and Western A 747 on its final decent into LAX
drones over seemingly in slow-motion

Kids skateboarding on the steps of the monolithic 1960s
Wilshire Park Place building
SLOW DISSOLVE TO

CLOSE UP ON

Kengo His glasses don’t hide how good-looking he is but
they magnify his eyes slightly making him look slightly like
a frog

We pull back to reveal

EXT WILSHIRE BLOULVARD - NIGHT

Kengo waits pacing on the corner

He changes his backpack from one shoulder to the other
looking down the street a little anxious He sees something
He hops to his feet excitedly

KENGO’S POV

A BEAUTIFUL GIRL crosses the street

This is SANDRA Kengo’s girlfriend

Sandra is dressed in a great cool outfit that she’s made

herself She has a totally unique style and vibe with the
awkward grace of young race horse colt

KENGO
(yelling)
Sandra
SANDRA
(yelling)
Hey

She trips over the curb as she hops off the traffic island in
the center of Wilshire Blvd One of her shoes to shoot off
her foot and into the street

Kengo’s face lights up He runs into the street dodging a
honking car He grabs her shoe and runs to her falling on
his knees holding her shoe out

Sandra does a little leap in the air and a kick She slips
her foot into the shoe
Kengo kisses up her leg and up her body to her face They
embrace not noticing the car that’s stopped waiting for
them to get out of the way

SANDRA
My punk Prince Charming

The driver lays on his horn Startled they run back to the
sliver of island in the center of Wlishire Blvd

ON THE TRAFFIC ISLAND
SANDRA
You could have gone in You didn’t

have to wait

KENGO
I went in and got stamped It’s
still fresh

He holds up his hand A black barcode is stamped on the back
of it

Kengo takes Sandra’s hand and licks it She squirms
Kengo presses his stamped hand against hers holding it
there Sandra looks at him smiling conspiratorially He

removes his hand Sandra’s stamp is perfect

SANDRA
Now I’m marked for life

She kissed him
WIDE ON THE TRAFFIC ISLAND

Kengo and Sandra kiss standing under a scrappy stick of a
tree as traffic whizzing past them

EXT SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Kengo and Sandra walk off of Wilshire onto a quiet side
street

KENGO
(remembering)
Oh I have something for you
He pulls a tube out of his backpack and hands it to her

Sandra gently fingers the top of the tube and very
seductively kisses the top of it

Kengo grabs the tube and bangs her on the head with it

KENGO
(laughing and turned on)
Open it You slut

Sandra opens the tube and gingerly pulls out a large black
and white photograph

Sandra moves into light of a street lamp and unrolls the
photograph She looks at it carefully mesmerized

Kengo covertly fishes his camera out of his backpack while
Sandra checks out the photo

CLOSE UP ON A PHOTO

A view of the sky framed by a window A 747 flies through a
beautiful sunset over the buildings of Korea Town Kengo in
silhouette his back to us looks out the window It’s a

great photograph It expresses a palatable sense of longing

Sandra slowly looks back up at Kengo and smiles impressed

Kengo quickly snaps a photo of Sandra smiling at him in the
yellow street light

SANDRA
(quietly a bit in awe)
Oh Kengo It’s really beautiful

KENGO
Really
She hugs him
KENGO
I used the self timer See It’s

me

Sandra laughs
SANDRA
I know I Recognize you

She studies the photo getting into it

SANDRA
I love it What airline is that

KENGO
Air China Look carefully at the
tail

He moves around next to her and delicately points it out
Sandra watches him not the photo smiling

KENGO
See You can tell by the cherry
blossom on it It’s the same flight
around the same time every day

SANDRA
I can feel you in it It’s
melancholy but it’s expansive
too

Kengo is deeply pleased by her critique

SANDRA
You’re getting really good

EXT HOUSE “BAR CODE” - NIGHT
People talk and smoke out front as Kengo and Sandra walk up
INT THE HOUSE “BAR CODE” - NIGHT

The house has been converted into a small club and bar It’s
intimate but sophisticated It’s populated by good looking
mostly Asian hipsters People dance A DJ spins records Pin
ball machines line the wall

Kengo and Sandra sit drinking and talking with a couple
friends We can’t hear the dialogue but Kengo is clearly
animated with his friends and having a good time
Sandra is moving around to the music shaking her hair
bobbing her head wanting to get up and dance She gestures
a toward the dancers Kengo shakes his head

Kengo’s friend puts a shot in front of him and Kengo knocks
it back His friend hands him another He drinks that too

Sandra grabs Kengo and pulls

He grabs the table in mock panic for leverage but she’s
strong and pulls him towards the dancers

Kengo puts up a good struggle but she gets him out in front
of the speakers She dances around him seductively He
tentatively begins to flap his arms like a weird bird to the
music

BACK AT THE TABLE his friends watch and laugh

ON THE DANCE FLOOR the camera swirls around Kengo and
Sandra

Kengo becomes more confident People dance around him as his
inhibitions melt away His dancing movements are weird and
floppy but strangely cool Awkwardly smooth like a frog doing
ballet

Sandra dances along laughing She leans over and plugs one
ear and yells above the music in the other

SANDRA
Super-Frog

Kengo kisses her and then leaps into the air flapping his
arms and legs harder hopping around head swiveling around on
his neck
Sandra grabs his head again and pulls it to her
SANDRA
(loud whisper)
Big dicked Super-Frog

She rubs his crotch He presses against her

As we PULL BACK the sound slowly fades to complete silence
Just the image remains

People dance wildly surrealistically in the silence
Slow fade out
EXT STREET - NIGHT ( FLASHBACK)

Sandra and Kengo zigzag drunkenly down the street leaning
against each other for support

Sandra carries her tube with Kengo’s photo inside

Kengo looks up at the sky and stops walking Sandra wraps her
arms around him looking up to see what he sees

SANDRA
What

KENGO
(whispering)
Wait Keep looking

ON THE SKY The clouds are milky illuminated by the city’s
lights The moon appears then quickly disappears back into

the clouds Kengo reaches his hand up to the sky in a weird
little gesture of reverence to the moon Sandra giggles

SANDRA
(quietly)
It’s full All the lunatics are
out

She kisses him out of his trance

SANDRA
(realizing ohhh)
That’s what the word came from
Crazy from the moon

Kengo cocks his head

SANDRA
Lunatics

KENGO
It’s the same moon as the people in
Sri Lanka look up and see We’re
all

He rubs his hands together wildly and waves his drunken arms
around simulating chaos

KENGO
War and tsunamis and shit but
it’s just still there the
same

SANDRA

Take a picture of us now

Kengo holds the camera out at as far as he can stretching
his arm They press their faces together She bites his ear

KENGO

(yelping)
Ow

The flash blinds them Freezing the moment
DOWN THE STREET

Kengo and Sandra manage to propel themselves along holding
hands

KENGO
Do you really like the one I gave
you

SANDRA
I love it

KENGO
You swear

SANDRA
God you’re so insecure

Sandra grabs his face and kisses him
SANDRA

It’s a great photograph You’re
gifted

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

A group of KOREAN KIDS take turns running and jumping as high
as they can planting their feet on the wall

A GIRL measures how high each guys’ feet land She takes
money from people betting on who can plant their feet the
highest

Kengo and Sandra stop to watch them Kengo takes a photo
After a moment Sandra pulls Kengo away
EXT STREET - NIGHT

Kengo and Sandra stand against Sandra’s car a dirty old
Volvo and make out It’s messy and passionate

Sandra puts her hand down Kengo’s pants the abruptly pulls
away and walks to the driver’s side of her car

SANDRA
Get in Super-Frog

KENGO
You’re not driving anywhere Youre
too drunk I’m walking you home

SANDRA
Who said anything about driving
Get in

Sandra unlocks her door and plops in She takes a little
flask out of her glove compartment and takes a swig

Kengo presses his face against the windshield
Sandra honks the horn
INT SANDRA’S CAR - NIGHT
Kengo kisses the windshield
SANDRA
Oh that’s so gross I’m never

kissing you again
(MORE)

SANDRA (contd)
There’s like about a billion
squushed bugs on the windshield I
haven’t washed it since we went to
Joshua Tree

Kengo tries to get in the passenger side of the car but
Sandra quickly locks it

KENGO
Come on open it or you’re going
to be very sorry

SANDRA
No way Bug mouth But I guess
that’s what super frogs eat Bug
guts

Kengo ducks down disappearing from view

Sandra moves to the passenger seat and looks in the side
mirror trying to find him

She opens the driver’s door leaning out Kengo leaps up from
behind it and pushes her back into the car kissing her
passionately Keeping his lips locked to hers as he crawls
over her to the passenger seat

SANDRA
Tell me about how you used to
pretend you were an invisible
Ninja

KENGO
I would practice my quiet Ninja
walking

They kiss deeply scraping teeth

KENGO (CONTD)
Ssneaking around my neighborhood
when it got dark

He takes a dramatic pause getting into it
SANDRA

I’‘d look in people’s windows and
see families eating diner

Kengo takes a big swig from the flask Sandra sucks it out of
his mouth

KENGO
Id watch fathers eating with
their sons

He gets lost in the memory

KENGO
Sometimes the whole family would be
laughing

Sandra watches Kengo He turns to look at her

KENGO (CONTD)
(ominously)
Later late at night I’d sneak
into their houses

He slowly put his hand under her skirt feeling her Sandra
bites her lower lip

KENGO (CONTD)
Id go into the girl’s bedrooms and
watch them sleep

Sandra’s mouth opens

SANDRA
(shocked)
You never told me that part

KENGO
Then as they were dreaming I
would gently peel their sheets down
and

She bursts out laughing and punches him

SANDRA
You are such a liar

They make out passionately Kengo slides his hands back under
her skirt Sandra fumbles with his belt

SANDRA
(without taking her lips
off Kengo’s)
Take them off

Kengo removes her panties and puts them in his mouth He
shakes his head and growls like a dog with a toy

SANDRA
(giggling)
No Your pants

She pulls her panties but he won’t let go She does and the
elastic snaps him in the face

KENGO
Ow

They resume making out Kengo starts to take off his pants

KENGO
(between kisses)
Let’s(kiss) go back(kiss) to
my(kiss) house

Sandra pulls away

SANDRA
No Kengo Your mom

KENGO
She doesn’t care

SANDRA
It always so weird there It’s
like

She looks off frustrated

KENGO
Why She likes you

SANDRA
I feel I don’t know like the
other woman

Kengo is freaked by what she’s just said He expertly shakes

it off

He kisses

KENGO
Oh whatever You’re crazy

her
KENGO

I’1ll sneak into your room and Ill
be gone before your parents wake

up
SANDRA

No way Can’t risk it My dad would

skewer you and have frog legs

She thinks this is really funny

SANDRA
(suddenly a great idea)
Wait

Sandra has a very mischievous look on her face

SANDRA
Let’s go to the building where you
work We can sneak into one of the
empty apartments

KENGO
No fucking way Someone’1l bust us

SANDRA
Well be really quiet We’ve done
it before

KENGO
Yeah but the more we do it the
better the odds are at getting
caught

Sandra sighs

KENGO
We can’t It full of busy-body old
people

SANDRA
(giggling)
Busy-body

She kisses him

SANDRA
You’re such a freak

They start to make out and it gets heavier and more intense

SANDRA
Fuck me

Kengo pulls his wallet out and gets a condom out of his
pocket

SANDRA
Give it to me Ill put it on

She gets his pants off and leans back for a better view
SANDRA

Wow God I’m always surprised by
how big it is

KENGO
Is that the only reason you like
me
She laughs
SANDRA
Yes

They continue making out as Sandra puts the condom on him

They slide over the seats into the back of Sandra’s Volvo
Their heads hit the roof and they have to kick their legs to

position themselves in the back seat

They’re laughing as they fumble with each other’s clothes but

soon their passion takes over

SANDRA
(breathless)
Busy-bodies

KENGO
Wait

He reaches for his pants that are crumpled on the floor He
digs in the pocket and takes his camera out of his jeans

SANDRA
Oh God no

EXT SANDRA’S CAR - NIGHT

Close on Sandra’s bare feet pressed against the back window
Her toes wiggles around in passion her feet press against the
window harder making little foggy impressions on the glass
Slow move back revealing more of the car

The flash goes off It’s like lightning in a Volvo

A couple walk by on the street not noticing The flash goes
off again

The car rocks gently
SLOW DISSOLVE TO
EXT KENGO’S ROOM - DAY
BACK TO THE PRESENT

Evelyn takes his glasses off and puts them on him She wets
her finger and tries to get the little ink smear off his
cheek He pulls away annoyed

KENGO
I have demons in my head and
they’re eating my brain

EVELYN
You have a lot of devil in you

KENGO
Come on mom I don’t believe that
shit

She puts a hand over his mouth

EVELYN
Don’t say shit

Kengo farts It’s loud He smiles

Evelyn shrieks and unclamps his mouth She reaches over and
pinches his nipple hard

KENGO
Ow

He turns away from her and toward the wall
Evelyn starts to tickle him
Kengo flaps the sheet blowing the fart smell on her

Evelyn screams and hops out of bed pulling the sheet off him
Revealing his naked (except for his underwear) body

Kengo covers himself with his hands
Evelyn runs out of the room laughing

Kengo sits up and adjusts his erection that is poking through
his underwear

Evelyn runs back in the room with a long stick of burning
incense

Kengo grabs a pillow and holds it over his crotch

KENGO
Mom

Evelyn giggles and does a swirling dance around his room
waving the incense

EVELYN
I’m scaring your demons away

Evelyn’s dance is part ballet part interpretative mixed with
traditional Kabuki moves She’s graceful and beautiful

Kengo watches her dance and spin around his room entranced

The phone rings breaking their spell

Kengo and Evelyn look at each other in mock-horror Neither
of them makes a move to answer it The machine picks up

EVELYN
(the outgoing message)
Hi neither Kengo or Evelyn are
home right now Please leave a
message after the tone and we will
call you back God Bless

KENGO
Oh God mom Why did you have to
add God Bless

EVELYN
Shhhhh

They listen

VOICE ON MACHINE (GLEN TABATA)
Hello Hello

Kengo and Evelyn laugh

KENGO
Oh shit I’m late

But he makes no effort to get up

GLEN
It’s Glen Tabata here Is anyone
home I’m calling to inform Kengo
that he is late for work by more
than one hour This is very late
Please call me at the office Hello
to you Evelyn I hope you are good

He hangs up

KENGO
He’s so sweet but why does he have
to be so formal

EVELYN
He is a gentlemen and a very
spiritual man

KENGO
Oh God mom He’s been in love with
you for years Evelyn

Kengo sits up and his head pounds He grabs his head

KENGO
(under his breath)
God please I‘ll never drink again
if you let me get through this day

Kengo stumbles out of bed His erection has subsided so he’s
safe to move around the room to gather whatever clothes he
can find that aren’t filthy

Evelyn watches as he smells a pair of jeans and decides that
they’re clean enough to wear He slides them on

Evelyn picks up a shirt and smells it

EVELYN
Uhh Horrible

She looks at him

EVELYN
You aren’t going to shower

KENGO
No time I’1l take a bird bath in
the sink

She cocks her head and looks at him strangely

KENGO
What What are you looking at me
like that for

EVELYN
You are really a man now

KENGO
Really

He looks at himself in the mirror He puffs up his chest a
little He makes a “man face”

Evelyn laughs

EVELYN
You are handsome Kengo like your
father was handsome

KENGO
(almost whispering)
Really
She nods
KENGO

I thought I got all my good looks
from my foxy mother

She actually blushes

EVELYN
You should get to work

KENGO
How do I look like him

She walks out of the room Kengo watches She has a great
body and he can’t help noticing her beauty

One of her buttocks is exposed and she has a slight wedgy
She adjusts it pulling her underwear out of her butt crack
as she walks away

KENGO
(calling after her)
HA
EVELYN
What
KENGO

It stands for hungry ass When that
happens it’s called HA When your
butt eats your

EVELYN
(mock-shocked)
Don’t talk to your mother like
that

She runs away

Kengo laughs

He walks over and looks out his window
KENGO’S POV

We recognize the view out the window from Kengo’s photograph
that he gave to Sandra

It’s a foggy day and visibility isn’t very far Another jumbo
jet from Asia makes its decent across the sky

Kengo smells his hands and fingers He can still smell Sandra
from last night He smiles thinking about her Rays of sun
break through the fog Kengo catches his breath at the sight
Heaven

EVELYN
(from the living room)
You should hurry

Kengo snaps out of his trance
INT BATHROOM - DAY

Kengo in a rush takes what he calls a bird bath splashing
water on his face and under his armpits

He looks in the medicine cabinet and finds his moms
expensive face cleanser He cleans his armpits with it then
his face He rinses gargles with mouthwash and he’s done

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Kengo quickly walks through the kitchen and into a small room
off the kitchen that he has converted into a darkroom

INT DARKROOM - DAY

It’s small but has everything he needs to develop black-and-
white photos

Kengo closes the door and switches the red light on He
expertly takes a roll of film pulls it open puts it in the
developing fluid into the enlarger into the tray and
develops a photo

Even though he’s in a rush it’s important for him to see
this photo

ON THE PHOTO
It slowly appears on the paper

It’s a great shot Sandra naked sitting on top of Kengo in
the back seat of her car from the night before

It’s a great shot It’s blurry but very erotic and very clear
they’re having sex

Kengo watches the image sharpen and contrast

Rushing he quickly pulls down his pants and starts to jack
off

EVELYN
(VO Outside the door)
Kengo you need to go

He pulls up his pants frustrated He gathers his things
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Evelyn sits on the floor and chants in front of a alter that
she’s constructed in the corner of the room It’s an eclectic
mix of Buddhist Hindu and Christian icons A large Thai
Buddha a big cross a Ganesh statue

Evelyn’s eyes are closed She gently rocks back and forth
chanting

Kengo passes through room He stops to watch her He looses
himself for a moment in her rhythmic chanting and prayer He
voice is lovely and radiates peace

INT KENGO’S ROOM - DAY

Kengo stuffs a few things into his backpack his camera a
sketch book a vintage army jacket that has several badges
and buttons pinned to it

He looks at his night stand noticing something
KENGO’S POV

On his night stand film canisters change gum and peaking
out from under a photography magazine a thin gold chain
Kengo pulls the chain revealing a small cross fastened to it

He hasn‘t seen in a long time He holds the tiny cross in the
palm of his hand and considers it He spaces out to it
nearly hypnotised It catches the light and flashes gently
pulling his consciousness back into the room

He kisses the cross and fastens the chain around his neck

Kengo carefully rolls up the naked print of Sandra and slides
it into a tube He puts the tube in his backpack

He sticks ear pods in his ears presses play on his iPod and
shoves it in his pocket He shoves his cell phone in the
other pocket takes one of the cameras off the shelf and is
off

Kengo’s music starts
EXT HALL - DAY

Evelyn continues her chanting as Kengo walks down the hall
He opens the front door quietly so he won’t disturb her

EVELYN
(VO From the living
room)
Kengo You left the front door wide
open last night again

He can’t hear her over his music as he walks out the door
forgetting to close it

EVELYN
(from the living room)
You must remember to close it
Kengo Kengo

EXT STREET - DAY

Kengo walks out of his apartment building onto the street
It’s a cold and windy day for LA He looks up at the sky

He pulls a red ski cap onto his head and turns on his iPod
Mellow ambient music gives Kengo his own private soundtrack
to the world as he walks down the street

Kengo seems to almost float in slow-motion along to his
music His hangover dissipates He’s in his own private
bubble

He stops to ponder an pile of garbage Someone has moved and
decided not to take a lot of their stuff There is an ironing
board a chair clothes and a collection of stuffed animals
Kengo stares at the discarded contents of someone’s life He
shakes off his trance Then he takes out his camera and
carefully deliberates the composition finally shooting a
photo

EXT STREET - DAY

Kengo walks down the street toward the high rise building of
Wilshire Blvd He is the only one on the street walking He
has the slight presents of a lone warrior in a post
apocalyptic world He makes sure to make the music on his
iPod enhance this mood

Kengo floats down the residential street He looks up into
the sky at the clouds He snaps a photo

Kengo slows down as he passes a large 3-D portrait of Christ
taped to the window of a shop He leans in for a closer look

As Kengo leans closer the Christ’s eyes close

He takes a couple of steps backwards making the eyes open
again and then

He zooms into the Christ with his camera lens Over the feet
of the Jesus is the price tag 999 and a bar code

Without missing a step Kengo reaches into his pocket
changing the music to match the festive mood of the market
He does this with one hand without having to look This is
obviously something he’s very practiced at

EXT WILSHIRE BOULEVARD - DAY

Kengo emerges onto Wilshire A few people on the street but
even here it’s oddly deserted for such a huge city

Kengo reaches into his pocket scrolling through for the
perfect music for the frenetic mood of the street A
ambulance screams buy but Kengo can’t hear it He looks up at
a helicopter circling

Each song he goes though changes the vibe completely even if
it’s just for the split-second before he changes it again He
finds a perfect song

The song transforms his mood He walks faster with a swagger
inspired by the energy of the rock song

Note The song he listens to here should be pop loud and
ecstatic

Kengo walks along watching the traffic and looking at the
architecture and occasional pedestrian

An OLD WOMAN in a traditional Korean outfit walks by A
couple of SECRETARIES gossip and smoke SOMEONE dressed up as
a hotdog waits to pass out fliers to people but there is
barley anyone walking He waves at traffic

Kengo slows to take a few photographs

He changes the music again This time it’s Jazz from the
1950’‘s The scene takes on a totally different mood

Note Think Miles Davis Maybe something from “Walking”

He changes the music a couple more times A sad ballad Hip
Hop 60s psychedellia

(Note Think something from George Harrisons “All Things
Must Pass like “Beware of Darkness” or “Isnt it a Pity”)

It’s not that he doesn’t have the patience for a full song
he does this to heighten and to get the most of his
experience walking to work

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

A large hole in the ground with cement slab poured at the
bottom

A HOMELESS MAN dressed in army fatigues sits next to the hole
with his shopping cart He has long gray hair He’s probably
a Vietnam War Veteran

The shopping cart has a large tattered American flag tied to
it

As Kengo passes by he stops and takes a photo

As the shutter snaps the Homeless Man gives Kengo the peace
sign Kengo flashes it back and keeps walking but he turns to
look back wondering about the man for a moment

EXT MID-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A building built in the mid-1960’s -- four stories with about
20 units It’s without architectural detail with the
exception of a cheesy sign in a Hawaiian-looking font that
reads PARADISE APARTMENTS

In the bottom of the Paradise Apartments is a small office A
sign on the door reads PARADISE COPIES anda smaller sign
below it reads NOTARY PUBLIC

Kengo walks briskly across the street and into the office
INT PARADISE APARTMENTS OFFICE - DAY

This is the maintenance and manager’s office for the
apartments but also a small copy store and Notary Public

Kengo walks in the front door A loud bell rings He turns
off the music pops the headphones out from his ears and
takes off his hat

Behind the counter is his boss GLEN TABATA 60 graying
handsome but a little uptight He’s the building manager and
Notary Public

Glen looks up at Kengo and gives him a very disappointed
look

Kengo walks over toward him He cares what Glen thinks of him
and is pained to have any disapproval from him

KENGO
I’m really sorry Mr Tabata

Kengo walks around behind the counter He carefully puts his
camera in his backpack

GLEN
Kengo Glen We’re both men now

KENGO
Okay (trying it out) Glen

Glen smiles slightly He turns and begins to sort through
some papers He seems sad and far away

Kengo watches him seeming to almost absorb his loneliness

KENGO
(gently softly)
I’m sorry (trying out his name)
Glen
Glen nods
KENGO

I was helping my mom at the market
The line was really long and my
cell phone battery died I forgot
to charge it

Kengo’s cell phone rings in his pocket He’s mortified It
rings again Kengo just stands there

GLEN
Just answer it

Kengo pulls his phone out and looks at it It’s stopped
ringing

KENGO
I missed it I guess my battery
wasn’t totally

GLEN
Will you put new paper in the
machines and copy this manuscript
It’s being picked up today

Kengo takes a big stack of paper and loads up two big copy
machines at the front of the office

As he is sliding paper into one of the machines he gets a
nasty paper cut He grimaces

CLOSE-UP ON KENGO’S FINGER
He squeezes it and blood comes out of the tiny slice

GLEN
You should always wear gloves when
you load the machines

Kengo sticks his finger in his mouth

KENGO
(his finger in his mouth)
I always forget

Glen takes a first aid kit off the wall and opens it

GLEN
You are letting your mind slip too
much You have to become
mindful

Glen removes a band-aid and some anti-bacterial ointment from
the first aid kit

KENGO
It’s okay I don’t need

But Glen has already methodically made Kengo a little
treatment for his cut

Kengo walks over to the counter offering Glen his finger

Glen carefully blots up the little sliver of blood off
Kengo’s finger applies the anti-bacterial ointment and
gently puts the Band-Aid on it

Kengo watches him He is touched by how much Glen obviously
cares for him

Glen hands Kengo some gloves and Kengo puts them on and gets
back to work copying the manuscript

Kengo’s cell phone beeps

Glen looks over

KENGO
I have a message It’s probably my
mom Evelyn

Kengo sheepishly pulls his phone out of his pocket and checks
it out

ON THE PHONE

The picture loads It’s a close-up of breasts They are nice
full firm breasts Sandra’s breasts

Kengo smiles and looks closer The phone rings and it says
Sandra Cell Glen looks over

KENGO
Sorry I’1ll turn the ringer off

He puts his cell phone away and gets back to work

GLEN
It’s okay Kengo I’m not your
prison warden

KENGO
I feel guilty that I was late

GLEN
You are young It’s okay to go out
and have good time I just think
you need

Glen looks off searching for the right words

GLEN
When I was your age I was in love
with a girl named Jessica

KENGO
What happened to her

GLEN
Her family didn’t approve of me

Glen seems full of sadness today
Kengo walks over toward him It’s clear Glen needs to talk

KENGO
Where was that

GLEN
When I was a young man I lived in
Long Beach I know I told you about
when I had the fruit store there

KENGO
Yeah You did It sounded really
cool

GLEN

You don’t have to humour me Kengo
You are a good boy

KENGO
I’m not humouring you I like to
hear about your life

A WOMAN walks into the shop

WOMAN
Hi I need to send a fax

GLEN
Sure let me help you

As Glen is helping the woman Kengo’s phone buzzes again
Kengo takes it out and looks

ON THE PHONE

The text window alerts him that he has a photo

Kengo presses a button and the photo loads

It’s a shot of Sandra’s pelvis Her pierced navel and smooth
stomach Her thumb pulls down the top of her panties so there
is just a cute little peak of pubic hair revealed

Kengo stares at the photo It’s definitely turning him on

The machine vibrates as it spits out copies

Kengo presses himself against it as he continues looking at
his phone and the Sandra’s sexy photo

His cell phone beeps and says LOW BATTERY

Kengo makes sure Glen and the woman are engaged and not
looking at him

He presses himself harder against the vibrating machine He
humps it a little

GLEN
Kengo

Kengo shoves his phone in his pocket quickly

GLEN
Will you load new paper in the fax
machine when you get the chance

KENGO
Sure

The woman thanks Glen and leaves
The office phone rings Glen answers it

GLEN
Paradise Copies and Management
Hold on He just got here

Glen holds the phone out to Kengo

GLEN
It’s for you

KENGO
Sorry
He takes it
KENGO
Hello this is Kengo Oh Hi

Sandra

Kengo pretends to be surprised that it’s her for Glen’s
benefit He gives Glen a big smile and points to the phone

KENGO
(whispering to Glen)
Sandra
Glen smiles
KENGO

Yeah I got it Of course I knew it
was you Who do you think I thought

Kengo goggles

KENGO

He giggles again Then he remembers Glen He mouths “sorry”
to Glen

KENGO
Look I can’t talk now I’m busy at
work and I’m tying up the fax line

Kengo is alarmed and turns away from Glen

KENGO
(quietly)

(acting normal again)
Okay Well thank you for calling

KENGO (contd)

GLEN
You don’t need to tell me “sorry”

KENGO
Okay I’m sor Yeah okay

GLEN
Is everything okay

Kengo looks at him puzzled

GLEN
With Sandra

KENGO
Oh yeah Uh Her car got towed
But she’s going to get it now

Kengo walks back over to the machine The machine hums and
blows out hot air Kengo is very distracted and anxious He
stares out the window grinding his teeth

KENGO
(suddenly blurting out)
Oh my Jesus Christ I forgot to go
and help Mrs Jun Pak with her
sink I mean bath leak

GLEN
Don’t talk the Lord’s name in vain

KENGO
Sorry I said I would help her
yesterday when I saw her at the
store

Glen thinks it’s a little odd that Kengo would be in such a
panic but he is a weird kid sometimes

KENGO
There’s a leak and I think it just
need tightened

Kengo rushes behind a curtain into a little room and emerges
with a tool chest

The copy machine starts beeping alerting them there’s a
paper jam

KENGO
(very stressed)
Oh no

Kengo is frozen with near panic

GLEN
Go go I’ll take care of it

without any irony)

Sandra gets off him flinging the bedspread off herself and
stands up She starts putting her clothes on

She hops around angrily trying to but her pants on
SANDRA
(pissed)

Kengo gets up and starts to put on his clothes on too

KENGO
I’m not brainwashed

Sandra stares at him waiting for him to say something else

KENGO
What if it’s true

SANDRA
(super frustrated)
It’s not true

Sandra is dressed She starts to walk away

She stops and turns back to him

SANDRA
(sadly soft)
You’re just a scared little frog
boy

She shakes her head and walks out of the room Kengo listens
to the door slam as Sandra leaves

He walks to the window opening the curtian He watches her
walk down the hall and quickly away

Kengo looks up to the sky spacing out to

Another huge jet makes it’s decent banking into it final
turn above downtown and on to LAX

INT PARADISE APARTMENTS OFFICE - DAY

Kengo slaps his forehead

KENGO
Oh no

Kengo turns to go back and get it

GLEN
Wait

Glen just stands there He opens his mouth but nothing comes
out He looks away from Kengo and down at his feet

Glen’s eyes tear up but he quickly turns away

GLEN

Kengo walks over to him
Glen disappears behind the curtain into the other room
Kengo watches the curtain

Glen comes back carrying a photo album

GLEN
I want to show you this

Kengo walks over and looks at the album with Glen

GLEN
(pointing to a photo of a
beautiful younger Evelyn)
That’s your mother when I first met
her

She’s stunning in her early 20’s or late teens

KENGO
Wow

He turns the page and there are more photos of her A tear
falls onto the page splashing on her face

Kengo looks up at Glen studying him

KENGO
(blurting)
Did you know my dad Do I look like
him

Kengo rubs the top of his ear
Glen closes the book slowly He looks off

GLEN
I’m dying Kengo

KENGO
What

GLEN
I have pancreatic cancer I have
six months If I’m lucky a year

Glen takes a moment for this to sink in then he takes a deep
breath and puts his hand on Kengo’s shoulder

GLEN
I want you to have the store

Kengo is shocked

KENGO
(abrupt accidently shrill
but without anger)
I don’t want the store
GLEN
You’re like a son

KENGO
(subdued panic)
No I’m not at all like a son I
don’t know how to be a son I’m
selfish I can’t

Kengo is trying not to cry

KENGO
Are you sure Doctors are stupid
They say the wrong thing all the
time

Glen nods

GLEN
I’m making peace with God Life is
nothing but a short painful dream
Thanks to His guidance I have made
it through this far

KENGO
Fuck God

Kengo is totally shocked that he has just said this

KENGO
I’m sorry

GLEN
(very gently)
Before I die there is one thing I
have to tell you It shames me to
say it but I have no choice

KENGO
It’s okay You can tell me
anything

GLEN

I have had lustful thoughts towards
your mother I’ve always been in
love with her

KENGO
I have too

Kengo is even more shocked that he’s just said this It’s
like he’s been suddenly stricken with Turrets Syndrome His
face turns bright red He looks away from Glen

Glen rests his hand on Kengo’s shoulder

GLEN
I know

Kengo suddenly hugs Glen and holds on to him tightly He
hides his face so Glen can’t see that he’s crying

GLEN
You poor boy

Kengo lets go of Glen and pulls himself together

GLEN
You’re going to have a difficult
time finding a woman you want to
share your life with after having
Evelyn for your mother

Kengo knows he is right It terifies him
GLEN
Youll hold her up as a standard
for all other women Even if you
try not to
Kengo blushes again He feels totally naked and exposed
Glen rubs Kengo’s shoulder trying to comfort him
GLEN
Every boy is a little bit in love
with his mother
Kengo is frozen and all the color drains from his face

Everything has changed

Glen walks back through the curtains to put the photo album
away

KENGO
(to the curtian)
You were good at being a little
like a father to me

We can hear Glen quietly crying behind the curtain

GLEN
(oS From behind the
curtains)
Will you do me a favor

KENGO
Anything

Glen holds his hand out through the curtain and hands Kengo a
piece of paper and 20

GLEN
Please go and pick up a
prescription for me at the
pharmacy You need some fresh air
Why don’t you get something to eat
while you’re out too

Kengo is torn between wanting to stay and comfort him but
it’s obvious Glen need to be alone

KENGO
Okay

Kengo grabs his backpack and starts to head out the door
Glen sticks his head between the curtains

GLEN
Be careful

EXT STREET - WILSHIRE - DAY
Kengo walks slowly through Korea Town He is still in a bit
of a daze He puts on his iPod Scrolling through the music

he can’t finds the right song for this moment

He pulls out his arm jacket and put it on He pulls his red
hat on too

EXT HARVERD AND WILSHIRE - OUR LADY OF THE ANGELS CHURCH - DAY

On the wall surrounding the church is a large statue of an
angel His arms are open wide and reaching to the sky

Kengo walks across the street He stops and stares up at
statue

The angel’s lifted arms convey a timeless longing for ecstacy
especially contrasted with the modern 60’s architecture of
the church on the other side of the wall

Kengo in his trance slowly lifts his arms up imitating the
angel People brush past him

INT PHARMACY - DAY

Kengo hands the prescription to the PHARMACIST The
pharmacist looks at the prescription He gives Kengo a sad
grim look

PHARMACIST
(gently with pity)
It‘ll be twenty minutes

The Pharmacist walks away sadly

KENGO
(under his breath to soft
to hear)
It’s not for me

EXT STREET - DAY

Kengo walks out of the pharmacy He takes his cell phone out
and looks at the picture of Sandra’s breasts He calls her

KENGO
Hi

He starts to get a little choked up but hides it well

KENGO
Sandra I’m sorry Wait Listen to
me What are you doing right now
Can you meet me Just for ten
minutes I need to talk to someone
(MORE )

KENGO (contd)
Can you get something to eat Meet
me at the Tofu House Okay bye

INT TOFU HOUSE - DAY

Kengo sits in front of a huge photographic mural of a temple

in Korea It stretches from floor to ceiling and wraps around
the corner He puts his iPod back on and watches people walk

by on Wilshire as he waits listening to music

A sexy WAITRESS with pink hair walks up to his table

KENGO
I’m waiting for my someone

WAITRESS
Do you want something to drink

KENGO
Yeah I’1ll have some green tea

He watches her walk to another table He turns his music up
as his mood brightens He takes his camera out of his
backpack

When he is sure that the pink-haired waitress isn’t looking
at him Kengo takes her picture and then quickly puts the
camera back

He watches the pink-haired waitress take the check from A
MAN The man is in his 50’s or 60s

On her way to the cash register she gives Kengo a big smile
Kengo smiles back and gives her a little wave

Kengo looks back at the Man gather his things and stand up

Something about this man is very intriguing to Kengo He is
captivated by him

The man is well dressed and handsome and one of the few Non-
Asians in the restaurant at the moment There is a grace and
worldly elegance about him that seems from another era a
tailored double breasted suit a hat a pocket square

KENGO’S POV

We zoom slowly into the man as he puts on his coat He turns
revealing the other side of his face and we see that his
right ear is strangely misshapen It looks as though
something had taken a bite out of it Very little of his ear
remains

ON KENGO

Kengo is frozen and all the color drains from his face It’s
as if he has seen a ghost He knocks over his water but just
lets it drip off the table and into his lap numb

The man leaves a tip and slowly starts to walk to the door

The waitress comes back to Kengo’s table with his tea

WAITRESS
Here you are

She looks down and sees that he has spilt his water into his
lap

WAITRESS
I’1l get a towel

Kengo doesn’t even notice her He is still dumbfounded
staring at the man

The waitress shrugs

WAITRESS
Whatever

She walks away

Kengo watches the man grab a toothpick open the door and
walk out to the street

Kengo grabs his backpack and bolts up from the table It’s as
if he has been shot out of a cannon propelling himself
across the restaurant toward the door

The waitress watches him

WAITRESS
Hey

Just before he leaves Kengo hears her He digs in his pocket
pulls out a ten-dollar bill and slams it on the counter He
runs out the door

The waitress watches Kengo run after the man

ON THE TABLE

Kengo’s red hat sits on the abandoned table It absorbs the
spilled water

EXT STREET - AFTERNOON

The man walks briskly down Wilshire navigating his way
through an abandoned construction site

We see Kengo blurry over the man’s shoulder running behind
him

The man slows down to light a cigarette Kengo gets closer

The man continues to walk and alternates between smoking and
picking his teeth with the toothpick

ON KENGO

Kengo keeps his distance not too far behind him

He’s out of breath from the rush of adrenaline surging
through his body as he trail the man His heart is beating
very fast Maybe we hear it

WIDE

We track with the Man and Kengo as they walk about 20 yards
apart down the block They have a similar gait Kengo does a

small skip so he can walk in sync with the man

The man stumbles over a plank He regains his pace and
continues walking smoking and picking his teeth

When Kengo gets to the plank he imitates the man’s trip
EXT STREET CORNER - DAY

The man stops at the corner to wait for the light to change

Kengo walks up to the corner and stands just a few feet
behind the man He cranes his head a little to see around to
the side of the man’s head so he can look at his ear

CLOSE UPKENGO’S POV

The side of the man’s head and his strange ear

Kengo gets a good look

Next to the man is a WOMAN waiting with her small SON He is
about eight

The little boy looks up and sees his ear too The little boy
stares

The mother picks up the little boy and whispers something
The light changes and the crowd walks

Kengo tries to stay close to him but not too close He
follows him down Wilshire His lap is wet from the spilled
water He looks like he’s wet himself

INT TOFU HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Sandra walks into the Tofu house She looks around the nearly
empty restaurant for Kengo walking through the restaurant

looking for him

Sandra spots Kengo’s red ski hat sitting on a table She
walks to the table and sits down thinking maybe Kengo is in
the bathroom She puts on Kengo’s hat and waits She feels
that it’s wet She smells the hat

EXT CORNER OF VERMONT AND WILSHIRE - AFTERNOON

The Man waits for the light to change Kengo stands not far
behind him A couple other people wait too

THE HOMELESS MAN Kengo took a photo of earlier in the day
stands under the fluorescent lights of the gas station He

holds a sign that reads “VIETNAM VET WILL WORK FOR FOOD OR
SEX” People pump gas ignoring him The man’s shopping cart
with his American flag is parked in front gas station sign

Kengo stares at the homeless man spacing out He hasn’t
noticed that the light has changed

The homeless man recognizes Kengo and salutes him Kengo
salutes him back He looks back and is shocked to see the man
and the other people waiting are gone and crossed the street

EXT STREET - DAY
Startled out of his trance Kengo looks around franticly

He catches a glimpse of the man who is heading towards the
huge subway stop across the street

Keno’s spacing out has cost him The light changes back to
“don’t walk” and the torrent of traffic is unleased in front
of him stranding him on his corner

He jumps up to see over a truck When it passed the man is
gone

Kengo jumps into the street nearly getting hit by a SUV The
driver lays on the horn hard Kengo jumps back onto the curb
There is no way he can cross the street now Kengo panics

EXT TOFU HOUSE - AFTERNOON

The waitress walks away

EXT STREET - AFTERNOON

Sandra walks out of the Tofu House and onto the street She
puts Kengo’s damp hat on and looks around at a loss of what
to do next

EXT VERMONT AND WILSHIRE SUBWAY STOP - AFTERNOON

Kengo sprints across the street toward the subway entrance

Just below the street is a plaza The ticket booth is on this
level and escalators that lead down to the metro

Kengo runs down the stairs and into the plaza He desperately
searches for the man in the empty plaza

KENGO’S SHAKY FRANTIC POV

Searching spinning 360 degrees around the plaza We hear his
breathing

Suddenly the man steps out from behind a ticket kiosk and
heads to the escalator

ON A TICKET KIOSK

Kengo stuffs a five into the machine He grabs his ticket and
takes off after the man

INT TOP OF SUBWAY ESCALATORS - AFTERNOON

Kengo gets on the nearest escalator and hopes it’s the right
one It’s a long escalator A hot wind blows up from the
subway tracks The man is gone

Kengo is despondent

KENGO
Fuck

Kengo leans over as far as he can and looks down the
escalator next to him This one is even longer It seem to go

on forever

Kengo spots the man on that escalator

Kengo hops over the steel partition onto the other escalator
His backpack almost causes the woman he’s landed behind to
fall

KENGO
Sorry Excuse me I’m really sorry

He cranes his head and stands on his tiptoes He can see the
back of the man’s head about 20 feet ahead of Kengo This is
an extremely long escalator

Kengo is inpatients is excruciating He’s terrified he’1l
lose sight of the man again

The screeching train pulls into the station People move
quickly down the escalator and onto the platform A big sign
on the platform reads “NORTH HOLLYWOOD”

The man steps off the escalator and running towards the train
and out Kengo’s view

Kengo freaks out and starts to push his way through a couple
people They’re not happy about it

KENGO
I’m really sorry I have to get
this train
WOMAN
There’s always another train you
rude bastard
EXT SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY
Kengo hits the platform and runs to the train
Just as he gets to it the doors begin closing
Kengo leaps onto the train The doors close on his backpack

INT SUBWAY - DAY

Kengo struggles with the door shoving himself into it with
all his weight ramming his shoulder into the closing door

People inside the train watch It’s an impressive fight

MAN IN TRAIN
Give up Get the next one

KENGO
No way

Kengo manages to squeeze himself into the train car It’s
like a difficult birth but he lives The train lurches off

INT SUBWAY - AFTERNOON
A couple people applaud

Kengo feels heroic for a second A commuter hero beating the
dehumanizing routine of their day

Kengo looks around It’s nearly deserted Just a few grumpy
passengers No man

Kengo walks up to the front of the car searching He walks
back to the other end of the car

An OLD BLACK MAN stands up from his seat

BLACK MAN
I’m sorry but can anyone spare
some change I haven’t eaten days
and I need help I’m blind

To prove it the man lifts his eyelids showing his milky
eyes He continues in Spanish

BLACK MAN
No tengo los ojos No miro

He walks down the car his hat out to the empty seats hoping
for money

BLACK MAN
Que Dios los acompane

Kengo puts a dollar in his hat

BLACK MAN
Finally my brethren be strong in
the Lord and in the power of his
might

A woman sitting near Kengo mouths along to this passage from
the bible

WOMAN
Amen
She crosses herself
KENGO
(very quietly)

Amen
He tries to peer into the next car
INT BEVERLY AND VERMONT SUBWAY PLATFORM - AFTERNOON

A small group of people on the platform lean over the track
and gaze into the tunnel waiting for the train The rumbling
gets louder and the train’s light appears The people leaning
step back as the train screeches into the stop

Before the doors even open completely Kengo launches off the
train and runs down the platform to the next car He’s like a
wild animal pursued by invisible prey His frantic movements
are oddly reminiscent of his frog dancing the night before

INT BEVERLY AND VERMONT SUBWAY PLATFORM - AFTERNOON

Kengo flings himself into the next car just as the doors
close

INT SUBWAY - AFTERNOON
Kengo lands directly in front of the man

The man looks up and for a brief moment Kengo and the man
make eye contact

In that moment everything goes completely silent except
Kengo’s racing beating heart The world has gone into slow
motion It’s a fleeting moment but of enormous resonance for
Kengo The man seems to have glimpsed into Kengo’s soul

The man slowly looks back to the newspaper he was reading
The train takes off

Kengo walks down the car to an empty seat He closes his eyes
and tries to calm himself

He opens his eyes Looking at his reflection in the window
opposite him he gently feels the shape of his face with his
fingers He sneaks glances at the man searching for
similarities between them

Kengo examines his reflection
Fade to darkness

by our teachings

The woman listens

Kengo looks inside the house He sees

INT HOUSE - DAY

A MAN asleep in a big chair This is the woman’s husband
EVELYN

I was carrying this child inside
me

Evelyn gestures to Kengo Kengo smiles at the woman
EVELYN
I was about to throw myself and him
into the ocean But I was saved by
His hand the One who is in heaven
and now my son and I live in the
holy light of our Lord
The woman considers this

Kengo hands her some literature

KENGO
Peace be with you

CUT TO
EXT HOUSE - DAY
Evelyn stands at the front door of another house

EVELYN
Okay go ahead

Evelyn gives little Kengo a soft nudge toward the door
Kengo reaches up and rings the doorbell
A YOUNG GUY opens the door

EVELYN
Hi were

GUY
Fucking holy rollers Why don’t you
fuck off and go to hell

He slams the door

Evelyn takes Kengo’s hand more to comfort herself than him
She’s visibly upset

EXT STREET SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Evelyn and Kengo walk off the porch Evelyn is shaking

Kengo looks up at her and sees that she’s upset He wraps his
arms around her waist and hugs her hard

EVELYN
(talking to both of them)
It’s okay It’s okay

A younger Glen Tabata walks up the sidewalk to them He’s
dressed in a suit and carries a briefcase with the same
pamphlets Evelyn and Kengo were handing out

GLEN
How’s it going

Evelyn suddenly brightens expertly covering her true
feelings

EVELYN
Great This is such satisfying
work

Kengo looks between them confused by his mother’s sudden
shift in tone and dishonesty

INT GLEN’S VAN - DAY ( FLASHBACK)

Kengo rides in the back and Evelyn is up front while Glen
drives Kengo looks outside the window and sees a father
playing catch with his son He cranks his head around to keep
watching as they pass

KENGO
Evelyn

EVELYN
Call me Mom

KENGO
Mom

EVELYN
Yes

KENGO

Where is my father right now

Evelyn and Glen look at each other

EVELYN
Well your father is our Lord

She turns around in her seat and looks at him

EVELYN
Our Lord must stay high up in
Heaven

KENGO
Why

EVELYN

He can’t live down here with us

KENGO
Why

EVELYN
Well He’s too busy But he’s
always watching over you sweetie
He always has your best interests
in his heart

This frustrates Kengo who has heard this a million times now
He wants another explanation Evelyn turns around to look at
him

EVELYN
He sent you down to be with me

Glen clears his throat He moves the rearview mirror so he
can have eye contact with Kengo

GLEN
It’s true Kengo that you don’t
have a father in this world and
you’re going to meet all sorts of
people who say stupid things to you
about that Unfortunately the eyes
of most people are clouded and
unable to see the truth Kengo But
in our world your father is the
world itself

Glen gets overly involved in lecturing Kengo and is
distracted He nearly misses a stop sign

Evelyn grabs his arm

EVELYN
Look out

Glen stops quickly and they all jerk forward After a brief
pause Glen gains his composer He starts to drive again

GLEN
You are fortunate to live in the
embrace of His love You must be
proud of that and live a life that
is good and true

Kengo thinks about this

KENGO
Yeah I know But God belongs to
everybody doesn’t he Fathers are
different though Everybody has a
different one Right

GLEN
Listen little man Someday our
Lord your father will reveal
himself to you as yours and yours
alone You will meet Him where you
least expect it But if you begin
to doubt or abandon your faith He
may be so disappointed that He
never shows Himself to you

Kengo sighs in frustration

KENGO
I know where babies come from

Glen swerves a little

KENGO
And I know how they are made
Evelyn

EVELYN
(embarrassed)
This is not something we are going
to talk about now

Evelyn mover the rearview mirror so she can see herself She
nervously puts on her lipstick Glen looks over at her
watching

EVELYN
(quietly not looking at
him)
Glen You should watch the road

She puts her lipstick away Her lips are perfect She turns
around back to Kengo

EVELYN
But you can talk to your dad by
praying to him

CUT TO
EXT BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY ( FLASHBACK)

A prison-like elementary school looms in the background It’s
the middle of a baseball game

Young Kengo is way outfield
The ten-year-old PITCHER pitches the ball and the batter hits

it The ball goes flying through the air It’s surprising a
little kid could hit a ball so high

The ball is heading right to Kengo

LITTLE KID PITCHER
Oh shit It’s going toward Kengo

All the players in the outfield run toward Kengo hoping to
get to him before the ball does but it’s clear that it’s not
going to happen unless these kids can fly

KENGO’S POV

The ball is very high but fast coming right toward him

SLOW MOTION

High on the field we float down toward Kengo His baseball
mitt is wide open and he has a look of horror on his face

KENGO
Please God Dad let me catch
this ball Please

Kengo concentrates really hard
Kids run toward him
The ball is getting closer

Kengo closes his eyes and leans back face pointed to the
sky

KENGO

(under his breath with

fast fervor)
Please Dad Prove to me that I’m
your son and that you can see me
and since you didn’t ever teach me
how to catch you can make it up to
me now by letting me

The ball flies by him and Kengo falls over backwards trying
to catch it The ball bounces on the manicured grass a few
feet behind him
People boo and groan
KID
(Os)
Idiot Open your eyes
ANOTHER KID
(Os)
His eyes can’t open very wide
Other kids laugh
Kengo opens his eyes and lies there looking up at the sky
THE SKY

It’s cloudless dirty blue and vacant

BACK TO PRESENT

INT SUBWAY - AFTERNOON

Kengo shakes off the memory and looks over at the man

The man is nodding off On his lap is a very old medical text
book It’s open to a diagram of the human reproductive
organs A woman next to him glances at it then quickly looks

away

Kengo looks at the seat across from him A WHITE KID about
15 sitting there now

ON THE KID

He’s dressed in baggy clothes sweats a Lakers jersey gold
chains and tucked into his waistband barely visible above
the elastic of his sweats the butt of a gun

The kid notices that Kengo is looking at the gun He pulls up
his shirt a bit higher making sure Kengo gets a good look at
the gun then pulls his shirt back over it He raises his
eyebrows at Kengo like he’s saying “What You got a problem
with something”

Kengo quickly looks away

INT SANDRA’S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

Sandra drives up to the front of Kengo’s building She is
wearing his red hat She honks a few times It’s a “code
honk” She leans over across the passenger seat and looks up

Nothing

SANDRA
Fucker

Sandra starts to cry A car behind her honks She drives on
INT SUBWAY - AFTERNOON

The train comes into the next stop the man stands up and
walks toward the door

The train slows down

The doors open and the man gets off Kengo jumps up and
follows The kid with the gun stays on the train

EXT SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON

Kengo follows him up the escalators toward the natural light
of

EXT THE STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

The man with Kengo close behind emerge into the hazy late
afternoon sunlight of the San Fernando Valley

The man crosses the street and waits at a bus stop Kengo
walks over and waits too He’s less worried about being
caught now so he stands pretty close

The man looks at Kengo Kengo can feel the man’s eyes on him
With great courage Kengo turns to meet the man’s eyes

Time seems to stop Kengo’s heart is in his throat his ears
buzz he can’t breath

The man gives Kengo a barely imperception nod and the
faintest smile or does he

Kengo opens his mouth as if to say something A weird little
song escapes

EXT PARADISE APARTMENTS OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Glen is standing on the sidewalk in front of the office He
looks his watch and then walks back in

Sandra pulls up in her Volvo It makes a lot of noise and
belches smoke

Sandra turns off the ignition and gets out She is wearing
Kengo’s red hat

Just as Sandra gets to the front door Glen walks back out
onto the sidewalk

Sandra takes Kengo’s hat off and walks up to Glen

They talk but we don’t hear what they’re saying

Glen can tell Sandra is upset He walks her into the office
INT BUS - LATE AFTERNOON

The bus isn’t crowded either Kengo sits up front across from
the man

Kengo looks at the man’s hands and then looks down at his
own

The bus stops at the next stop and more people get off

A very OLD WOMAN gets on She is having a hard time walking
She stands directly in front of the man

As the bus lurches froward the old woman almost falls The
man looks back down at his paper

Kengo can’t believe how inconsiderate he is He is profoundly
disappointed

KENGO
(to the old woman)
Maam Excuse me Maam

The old woman looks over at Kengo

KENGO
Please Sit here

He gets up and helps the woman over to his seat She sits

OLD WOMAN
Thank you very much It’s so hard
for me to get to the back of the
bus

She smiles at Kengo

OLD WOMAN
You’re such a handsome gentleman

Kengo smiles

OLD WOMAN
You must have lovely parents

Kengo smiles He looks over to the man who continues to read

OLD WOMAN
What is your name

KENGO
Kengo

OLD WOMAN
Oh that’s a Japanese name Are
you Japanese

KENGO
No I’m American

OLD WOMAN
But where are you from originally

KENGO
Here I’m American I was born
here

OLD WOMAN

But you’re Japanese

KENGO
No I’m Chinese I’m a Chinese
American With a Japanese name

OLD WOMAN
That is very American I’m Polish
We don’t have a Polish town but you
have a Little Tokyo and a
Chinatown Do you live there

KENGO
No I live in K-Town

The old woman cocks her head and gives him a puzzled look

KENGO
Korea Town

OLD WOMAN
Oh how confusing

Kengo sort of fake laughs humoring her

His cell phone rings This panics him He grabs it and looks
at it It say’s Work

KENGO
(under his breath)
Shit
He answers his phone
KENGO
(quiet)
Hello Glen

He panics

KENGO
Sandra

Everyone on the bus looks at him because Kengo just yelped
her name

Even the man looks up from his paper for a moment
Kengo and the man make eye for a brief second
The man looks back at his reading
KENGO
(quieter)
I’m really sorry I can’t believe
what’s happening
His phone starts to beep obnoxiously He looks at it
KENGO
Oh fuck Sandra my battery is
dying I’m okay but something
really
His phone dies He closes it and put it away
The Old Woman laughs Kengo looks down at her

She is asleep but once in a while she laughs and smiles

The bus pulls onto the freeway It looks like it’s going
somewhere far

Kengo puts his iPod on He scrolls though some music
searching for something that seems appropriately weighty
enough for this situation

As he searches for the right music he watches the man
looking for a song that fits his vibe

He tries several different songs but everything seems
trivial Then suddenly he finds something It’s strange and
haunting It could be the man’s theme song

Note Arvo Part (something from LITANY) Brian Eno and Harold
Budd (something from THE PEARL) would all have pieces that
would be great here

INT PARADISE APARTMENTS OFFICE - DAY
Sandra slams down Glen’s office phone
SANDRA
(frustrated)
Nothing
She paces Glen stands by the counter watching patiently

SANDRA
Sometimes I want to just split

She looks over at him

SANDRA
I feel like running away
Vanishing Then maybe he would

She runs out of words She starts to cry

SANDRA
I’m sorry God I’m being such a
stupid girl

Glen grabs two small folding chairs from behind the counter
and a box of tissues He unfolds them

GLEN
(gently)
Sit

Glen waits for Sandra to sit before he does She grabs a few
tissues as Glen holds the box

SANDRA
(through her tears)
I would go to Mongolia on a trek
That’s one of the few places that
hasn’t been totally raped by
western civilization

Glen smiles He just listens

SANDRA
I could go live with the fucking
nomads They heard across these
beautiful meadows that go on
forever

She starts to cry even harder

SANDRA
They have these round tents and
they all just share the same
room

Glen moves a little closer to her and takes her in his arms
She calms down Glen sits back and takes her hand and pats
it

SANDRA
(calming)
I’m sorry I said fucking I’m have
a mouth like a garbage can

Glen laughs Sandra does too

SANDRA
I’ve never seen you laugh

GLEN
That was the first time

She laughs a little more Sandra looks at him like he is a
whole new person

SANDRA
Why is he such a
GLEN
Weirdo

SANDRA
Exactly Totally

GLEN
Well It’s very difficult to let
people be who they are without
letting our expectations of them
get in the way

SANDRA
I’m not trying to change him I
just want him to be more

She stops realizing what she is saying Glen smiles

GLEN
Remember why you love him and why
you first realized that you did

Sandra looks off remembering something specific

GLEN
You fell in love with him because
he’s a weirdo

Sandra laughs

GLEN
All of the different parts of him
make him who he is Right now he
needs all these parts to be
Kengo Even when some of him makes
us crazy They all fit together

Sandra nods

GLEN
You two fit together

Glen’s eyes tear up Sandra see how sad he suddenly is

takes his hand and gives it a kiss

SANDRA
You’re a weirdo too

She

INT BUS - LATE AFTERNOON

Kengo steals looks at the man His hands shoes parts of his
face mouth

The man takes some pills out of his pocket He tosses a pill
into the back of his throat and swallows it dry

Kengo swallows in unison He looks out the window seeing
EXT FREEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON (KENGO’S POV)

A station wagon carries a family A MAN drives while his WIFE
is turned around in her seat yelling at her SON in the back
seat

The little boy is crying
FLASH BACK - A THREE YEARS EARLIER
INT KENGO’S ROOM - VERY EARLY MORNING

Kengo’s room is similar but the objects in the room are
different - those of a younger boy He is in his mid-teens
here

Kengo sleeps Suddenly the room starts to shake violently
It’s an earthquake A large one

Kengo bolts upright in bed and watches the room shake Some
of his things fall off the shelves

From the other room we hear Evelyn scream

Evelyn comes flying into the room nearly ripping Kengo’s door
off its hinges in terror She’s wearing only her panties

KENGO
It’s okay It’s okay It’s just an
earthquake

Evelyn flies across the room and lands in bed with Kengo She
grabs onto him like he’s a life raft

EVELYN
(screaming)
It’s the big one This is it

The shaking stops but Evelyn won’t let go of Kengo Her
breasts are squashed against him

Car alarms are going off

Kengo’s room is a wreck (more then usual) Most of the things
that were on the shelve are on the floor

KENGO
I don’t think that was the big one
but it was a big one

Kengo sits up and the bed moves Evelyn think it’s another
earthquake

EVELYN
Oh my God

KENGO
Mom it’s okay That was me

He hugs her comforting her

KENGO
Next time we should stand in the
door jam That’s what you’re
supposed to do It’s the strongest
part of the building

Evelyn is crying
EVELYN
I know people are hurt People have
died I know it

Kengo tries to comfort her

KENGO
We’re okay

EXT STREET - MORNING

Evelyn in a rather revealing and frayed nightgown and Kengo
stand in front of their building

Car alarms are still going off

Kengo takes photos of a fallen street lamp that’s shattered
on an SUV

Other people from the building are on the sidewalk too and
across the street

Kengo puts his arm around Evelyn to comfort her

An OLD WOMAN from their building gives them a dirty look
obviously appalled by what she deems their inappropriate
intimacy

Kengo sticks his tongue out at her and wiggles it obscenely

The old woman couldn’t be more horrified

KENGO
Come on let’s go back inside The
building’s fine

The traumatized old woman watches them retreat back into the
building

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Kengo paces as he dials the phone that’s tethered to the
kitchen wall

He gets a busy signal and dials again It’s busy

KENGO
(under his breath)
Shit

The electricity buzzes back on and several lights come on
INT LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Evelyn sits on the couch very disheveled and scared
watching news about the earthquake on television She has a

blanket wrapped around her

Kengo comes in from the kitchen carrying a tray of tea He
sits down next to her and hands her a cup

KENGO
I keep trying to call Sandra but
it’s busy

Evelyn takes the tea and grabs Kengo’s hand and holds on to
it tightly

EVELYN
I’m sure all the lines are tied up

ON THE TV footage of a fallen building and a stretcher being
loaded onto an ambulance

EVELYN
(bursting in to tears)
Oh no No

Kengo rubs her back

KENGO
It’s okay

EVELYN
No It’s not okay We have to do
something We have to help

CUT TO
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY ( FLASHBACK)
Evelyn is on the phone organizing with her Church people
EVELYN
I‘1l pick you up I’ve got some
blankets here What about canned

foods Non-perishables

There’s a pile of clothing and other items ready to be
donated to victims

Kengo carries a sleeping bag into the kitchen adding it to
the pile

Evelyn hangs up and goes into a frenzy of activity preparing
to go help the earthquake victims

EVELYN
(emptying a cabinet of food)
They’re picking us up in half an
hour

KENGO
(calm strong)
I’m not going

EVELYN
What

KENGO
I’m not a believer Mom Not
anymore

Evelyn freezes her frantic gathering He walks over to her
and places his hands on her shoulders

KENGO
I haven’t been for a long time and
I’ve felt like I don’t know
Today feels like a good time to
tell you

Evelyn sits down on the floor and puts her head in her hands

KENGO
I’m sorry mom I love you but I
don’t believe in your God I’m
not going to pretend like it
anymore

Evelyn starts to cry

KENGO
Come on Evelyn Don’t be a martyr

She stands up walks to her room and closes the door

INT EVELYN ‘S ROOM - DAY

Evelyn lies on her bed and weeps Kengo knocks on the door
and then walks into the room He sits down on her bed He

hands her a box of tissues She takes them and blows her nose
and rubs her eyes

EVELYN
I can’t take more than one
earthquake per day

KENGO
Evelyn

He makes sure he has her attention This is serious

KENGO
I want you to tell me who my father
was

Evelyn takes a deep breath

EVELYN
(automatically)
Your father is up

KENGO
(strong and firm)
No Evelyn The truth

Evelyn hides her face under a pillow

EVELYN
(muffled into the pillow)
No

Kengo grabs the pillow and pulls it off her He throws it
across the room the

KENGO
(firm but calm)
Enough Mom Tell me You can’t hide
this from me my whole life I’1l
never be able to believe in
anything if you do

Evelyn is surprised by how self possessed her boy suddenly
is The earthquake has cracked the surface of him and a man
is underneath

INT KITCHEN - MORNING ( FLASHBACK)

Kengo and Evelyn sit at the kitchen table looking at each
other They drink tea

Evelyn holds the army jacket we recognize as Kengo’s now
She carefully places it on the table like it’s an egg Kengo
reaches for it but Evelyn holds her hand up stopping him

Evelyn gets up and grabs a small box she keeps on the top of
the refrigerator She sits back down with it takes a
cigarette and a book of matches out and lights it She takes
a big inhale and slowly exhales

Kengo is a little shocked but he doesn’t say anything

Evelyn takes another big drag She starts to say something
but then stops only smoke coming out of her mouth

KENGO
(frustrated)
Come on Evelyn Talk

Evelyn takes another drag and exhales

EVELYN
(slow finding the words)
I was living in a deep darkness
in my teen years My soul was in
chaos Like an underwater volcano

She makes an elaborate gesture expressing what an underwater
volcano might look like

EVELYN
The true light was hidden behind
dark clouds

She adds dramatic sound effects
Kengo rolls his eyes
EVELYN
No Really it’s the truth I used
to have disturbing thoughts
She takes another drag of the cigarette

KENGO
What ‘disturbing thoughts’

This is difficult to talk about with her son

EVELYN
about death and things I

I
demons

saw
Kengo gets goose bumps He realizes she isn’t making this up

EVELYN
I would try everything to make them

just
She throws her arms up as if the demons are in the room now

EVELYN
(yelling at the demons)

Go Away
She takes another drag of her cigarette and to Kengo’s
astonishment blows out a couple of perfect smoke rings

EVELYN
I tried everything Even LSD

Kengo is shocked Someone should throw a blanket over him

EVELYN
That make them worse
And so I had knowledge of
She looks away from him and then back
EVELYN
-several different men Without
love
She stops and takes a drag It seems like she can’t go on any
further She stares at the jacket

EVELYN
I Don’t want you to judge me
Kengo

KENGO
(trying not sound
horrified)

Go on

EVELYN
You know what it means to have
knowledge don’t you

Kengo rolls his eyes again

KENGO
Yes God what century are we
living in You’re acting like
there is still a queen or
something I know what it is to
have knowledge of someone

Now Evelyn’s a little shocked She looks at him wondering
if he really knows what having knowledge means

Kengo presses together the index finger and thumb on his
hand then sticks his other finger through it a few times
clearly indicating sexual intercourse

Evelyn gasps and swats the offending gesture off Kengo’s
hands

KENGO
Stop stalling

She takes another drag of her cigarette

EVELYN
Do you have knowledge of Sandra

Kengo blushes and tries not to smile Then he shakes it off

KENGO
Mom

He uses “mom” as a weapon of manipulation

KENGO
Just tell me about my father

EVELYN
(carefully without
emotion)
I got pregnant in the second year
of high school
(MORE )

EVELYN (contd)
A friend of mine introduced me to a
doctor who gave me an abortion

She looks at Kengo for his reaction making sure he isn’t too
shocked at what she is telling him Then she continues

EVELYN

He was a very kind doctor And
handsome and pretty young too

for a doctor
Kengo nods encouraging her along

EVELYN
After the procedure

he lectured

to me about contraception

A helicopter flies over making her have to talk louder

EVELYN

(in a deep man voice)
“Abortion was good neither for the
body nor the spirit” That’s what
he would say I should also be
careful about venereal disease so

I should always be sure

to use a

condom and he gave me a new box of

them

Evelyn giggles at the memory She
the memory She spaces out as the

KENGO
Mom

Evelyn snaps out of it She looks
that he’s here She continues her

EVELYN

takes another drag lost in
helicopter noise fades

at Kengo remembering again
story

I told him that I had condoms but
he told me that the guys probably
didn’t put them on right Kengo
you would be amazed at how few
people know the right way to use

them

Kengo makes a confused face wondering what people might do
with condoms ‘the wrong way’

EVELYN
But I wasn’t stupid and I was very
careful about contraception I
mean the minute we took our
clothes off I would be sure to put
it on the penis (she is suddenly
embarrassed) on the man myself

Evelyn does a little gesture miming putting a condom on a
man

Kengo is a little grossed out He tries not to let her see

EVELYN
You just can’t trust men with
anything like that

Kengo nods to get her to keep talking

EVELYN
Kengo You know about condoms
right

KENGO
Yes Totally I carry them in my
wallet

She stares at him

KENGO
Go on Come on

EVELYN
Well two months later I got
pregnant again

KENGO
Jesus

Evelyn is self-conscious Embarrassed she looks down

KENGO
(gently encouraging)
Sorry Go on

Her cigarette helps her have a little more courage She takes
a big drag and blow more smoke rings They’re like little
shields of smoke

EVELYN
I went back to the same doctor who
I knew I could trust and who I knew
wouldn’t tell my parents He took
one look at me and scolded “I told
you to be careful What are you
thinking”

She gets a little quieter now She picks at a piece of lint
on the army jacket

EVELYN
I couldn’t stop crying

A siren grows louder and then fades again

EVELYN
He was so mad I told him I had
used the condoms and that I was
very careful but he didn’t believe
me

Evelyn suddenly is like a sad little girl

Kengo moves to try to comfort her but he doesn’t know how and
really wants to hear about his father

KENGO
Mom Tell me Please

EVELYN
The doctor was your father Is your
father

Kengo stops breathing

They sit in the silence waiting for the consequences of this
revelation waiting to see if the universe will come to and
end

Kengo finally takes a breath

Evelyn let’s the gravity sink in then continues

EVELYN
About six months after my second
abortion and after a series of
weird events I ended up having
knowledge of the doctor himself He
was about thirty at the time and I
was sixteen He was very handsome

Evelyn is trying not to get emotional by pretending like she
is talking about somebody else

EVELYN
He was still a bachelor He was
kind of boring to talk to but we
didn’t talk much He was sweet

Remembering him and that time in her life Evelyn smiles

EVELYN
His right ear was kind of
mangled A lot of it was missing
He was a medic in Viet Nam but he
said that’s not how it happened A
dog chewed it off when he was a
boy He was just walking along the
street one day and when a big black
dog he had never seen before jumped
up and bit his ear off

KENGO
Oh whatever

Evelyn is slightly startled back into the room from her
memory

EVELYN
(consistory)
I think it happened in the war

She carefully folds the army jacket

EVELYN
He used to say he was glad it was
just his ear He could live without
an entire ear

Evelyn gently slides the jacket across the table in front to
Kengo

KENGO
(in awe)
This was his

Evelyn suddenly starts to cry
Kengo picks it up and smells it

EVELYN
(through her tears)
Being with him helped me get
myself back

Evelyn takes deep breath Kengo she’s how brave she is

EVELYN
When I was having knowledge of
him I managed not to think
disturbing thoughts I even got to
like his ear

She reaches over and traces her finger around Kengo’s perfect
ear

EVELYN
I thought it was cute

Evelyn lights another cigarette

EVELYN
He was so dedicated to his work He
would lecture me about the use of
the condom while we were in bed
When to put it on and when to take
it off You think this would make
for a foolproof contraception but
I ended up pregnant again

KENGO
With me

Evelyn nods slowly
Outside another siren screams past

Kengo takes this in Now he has even more questions but
doesn’t know where to start

Evelyn senses this and tries to help out

EVELYN
He examined me and he was the one
who told me I was pregnant He was
really mad and said I had been
cheating on him but it wasn’t true
He was the only man I had been with
for months He got me pregnant

KENGO
Didn’t you tell him that

EVELYN
Yeah but he didn’t believe me All
my friends knew him and we would go
out together with them and they
knew that he was the only one I had
been with He just kept saying “My
contraceptive techniques are beyond
reproach which means you have has
relations with another man”

Evelyn shakes her head

EVELYN
But I hadn’t I was devastated I
was so hurt

KENGO
I understand I don’t blame you

EVELYN
He called me a slut He demanded I
get another abortion But there was
no way I could that again

he

Kengo fights tears back He puts his hand on Evelyn’s hand

EVELYN
That was the last I ever saw of
him

She seems to helpless and venerable as she remembers her
past

EVELYN
(quietly)
He never even called me or
anything

KENGO
Fucker

Kengo pats her hand

EVELYN
It’s okay Mom

EVELYN
When my parents found out they
kicked me out of the house I was
going to kill myself I was going
to drive to San Francisco and jump
off the Golden Gate bridge

KENGO
I’m glad you didn’t

EVELYN
Glen Tabata found me crying out
wondering the streets and took me
to the church shelter Without him
I would have died

KENGO
So biologically speaking my
father is that fucking obstetrician
that you had knowledge of

EVELYN
Oh no listen This isn’t the whole
truth

(MORE)

EVELYN (contd)
I took the most rigorous
contraceptive measures and became
pregnant In fact I became
pregnant three times in a row
That’s not chance

Kengo knows what’s coming

EVELYN
Three chance occurrences is not
chance The number three is none
other than that which is used by
our Lord for Revelations

Kengo sighs exasperated

EVELYN
It was our Lord’s wish that I give
birth to you See the doctor’s
contraceptive methods were
absolutely foolproof Your father
is the Lord You came into this
world not through carnal knowledge
but through an act of our Lord’s
will

KENGO
Oh God mom They brainwashed you
I’m sure every mother wants to
think her son is the son of God
but

He stops knowing there’s no dissuading her from her faith

KENGO
Does the doctor know that you had
me

EVELYN

I don’t think so I never saw him
again He never contacted me in any
way I’m sure he has no idea

Evelyn looks down at the box where she keeps her cigarettes
She pulls a tiny gold cross on a thin gold chain

EVELYN
This was his too

She hands it to Kengo

He looks at it like it’s a the missing piece of an ancient
secret He puts it on

Evelyn gets melancholy again and seems a million miles away

KENGO
Mom

Evelyn consciousness comes back into the room

EVELYN
Yes sweetie

KENGO
Am I like him at all What did I
get from him

Evelyn looks at him considering his question

EVELYN
Well not his ears

She giggles and then covers her mouth

KENGO
What

EVELYN
Your big wee-wee

Kengo is horrified

A little after-shock rattles the room and they both run to
the doorway

BACK TO THE PRESENT
INT BUS - LATE AFTERNOON

Kengo lost in thought and memory stares off into the vast
empty spaces of the valley outside the bus window

The old woman wakes up and looks up at Kengo She taps his
leg startling him

OLD WOMAN
You look very far away in a sad
place

Kengo looks over at the man and looks closer at his ear
KENGO’S POV

A slow zoom into the man’s ear It does look like it was
chewed off by a dog

Kengo looks back at the old woman

OLD WOMAN
Whatever it is that is troubling
you will be gone Things are always
changing

The woman holds her finger up as if to tell him to wait She
closes her eyes She opens them again

OLD WOMAN
See Things are different now than
they were a second ago

Kengo smiles

OLD WOMAN
There is only ever now

KENGO
Are you physic

The woman laughs

OLD WOMAN
No Just very old So I know a
little about time

Like he’s been struck by lightning Kengo suddenly remembers
something He unzips his backpack and takes out his camera

KENGO
Can I take your portrait

OLD WOMAN
Why Because I’m such a relic
You’ve never seen anyone this old

KENGO
No no that’s not I think you
have a great face

The old woman bats her eyes like a Hollywood starlet
Kengo laughs taking this as consent

OLD WOMAN
Is that digital That’s all anyone
ever says anymore Digital
digital digital The whole world
is not made of one’s and zeros

KENGO
No this good old fashioned film

He crouches down positioning himself so the old woman is in
the foreground and in the frame not far behind her the man

The woman stares into his lens
Kengo racks the focus to
THROUGH THE LENS

The old woman goes out of focus and the man comes into focus
perfectly

Just as Kengo presses the shutter the man stands up going
partly out of frame

The camera makes a whirling sound rewinding the film That
was the last photo on the roll

KENGO
(in frustration)
Oh

OLD WOMAN
What Bad Ugly

The man is getting ready to get off at the next stop

KENGO
(distracting looking at
the man)
No It’s great That was the last
shot
KENGO

(to the old woman)
This is my stop

The old woman blows him a kiss as the bus slows

OLD WOMAN
Remember It’s always right now

The doors open and Kengo follows the man off the bus

INT STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

The bus drives off leaving the two of them

Power lines buzz and crackle in the distance suspended by
huge towers This is mostly an industrial area but a new
housing development is creeping in Every few blocks between

warehouses an old house remains but not for long

The sun is low and the few clouds are beginning to take on an
orange tint

The man walks slowly along the barren street
Kengo quietly follows half a block behind him

They’re the only people on the street and seems like they’re
the only ones left on the planet

A cold dry desert wind blows litter down the street A fast
food wrapper wraps around Kengo’s shin He has to shake his
leg violently to get it off

As Kengo passes a junk-yard a furious dog runs at him
flinging itself against the fence barking ferociously at
Kengo The dog didn’t bark at the man

Kengo is startled and even more adrenaline pumps through him
He walks on his heart pounding

The only sound now is the man’s shoes rhythmically tapping
against the side walk It’s oddly hypnotic

Kengo’s practices his silent Ninja walking
EXT FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON
WIDE

Two giant electrical towers holding up power lines rise out
of the field of dead grass and dumped garbage

The power lines buzz loudly like a swarm of giant insects

The man and Kengo are like ants as they make their way across
the buzzing field

Kengo remains at a safe distance but makes sure he keeps the
man in view

ON KENGO

He walks with determined trepidation as if his about to
discover a new continent or the secret identity of a spy

KENGO
(whispering barely
audible)

Are you my father

He takes a deep breath

KENGO
(just slightly louder)
Are you my father

He takes another deep breath

KENGO
(as loud as he can without
the man hearing)
Are you my one-eared father

Kengo takes a deep breath

KENGO
(yelling as loud as he
can)
HEY
The man stops and turns to look

Kengo ducks down hiding in the grass

The man just sees an empty field He takes a few steps back
toward where Kengo is hiding

ON KENGO

Crouching in the tall grass his heart beating wildly he
hears the man walking toward him

The man looks around and then turns and keeps walking
EXT FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

The man leaves the field and walks around the corner of a
building

Kengo pops up and runs as fast as he can to catch up
EXT STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

The man his shoes clicking walks along

Kengo appears behind him

They continue walking through the industrial wasteland of
this part of town

ON KENGO

KENGO
(quietly)
If you are my father you will know
I’m here

Kengo closes his eyes concentrating He continues walking
KENGO

(quiet pleading)
Turn around and see me

Kengo opens his eyes The man doesn’t turn around

Kengo closes his eyes again

KENGO

If you are my father

He stumbles off the curb He opens his eyes

KENGO

Come on I’m part of you

Kengo’s eyes fill with tears He desperately needs this man

to turn around and acknowledge

KENGO

him

(a touch of anger)
I’m from you Turn around

Kengo stops walking and concentrates hard He touches the

cross around his neck

ON THE MAN

The man slowly turns around so
MANS POV

Kengo eyes shut reaching for

Who is this bizarre seemingly
gesticulating and genuflecting

ON THE MAN

The man slowly turns and walks
the assault

CLOSE ON KENGO

see Kengo

the sky

possessed street kid
to the sky

on his shoes clicking against

Kengo keeps his eyes squeezed shut as tight as possible

squeezing out tears

KENGO
(like a prayer)
Are you my father

He raises his arms up in the air as a conduit to receive the
answer he needs

KENGO
See me

He puts his arms down and slowly opens his eyes
KENGO’S POV
The street is empty The man is gone
Kengo panics He runs up the street
KENGO
(yelling)
Hey
Kengo comes to an alley too narrow to drive a car down

Kengo stops

He listens and faintly but distinctly hears the mans shoes
echoing from somewhere down the alley

He walks runs down the long alley
IN THE ALLEY - VERY LATE AFTERNOON
Kengo runs a few steps then stops and listens again
Utter silence except for the wind

Kengo runs as fast as he can and comes around the corner
to

EXT BASEBALL DIAMOND - DUSK

This is the same dusty baseball diamond we saw at the
beginning of the script

Long neglected surrounded by a rusty chain-link fence weeds
growing on the pitcher’s mound the dilapidated dugout
tagged with layers of graffiti discarded spray paint cans
laying under the bleachers the burnt and rusted car missing
its wheels

Kengo runs into the diamond and stops
KENGO
(yelling)
Hey Hello

There is only a slight echo

KENGO
(yelling)
Bastard
Still nothing
KENGO

(not yelling)
Fucking bastard Where did you go

He listens of an answer Again just the wind

KENGO
Im the bastard

Kengo kicks an empty spray paint can The can bounces through
the dirt

He walks over to the battered car and looks inside
KENGO’S POV
INSIDE THE CAR

The seats are ripped up and there are several syringes laying
on them

A used condom is draped over the steering wheel

Kengo walks away from the car back to top of the pitcher’s
mound

He looks up at the sky
THE SKY

It’s nearly dusk and the sky is turning incredible shades of
pink and orange

ON KENGO

Kengo turns in a full circle surveying the area He walks
into the dugout

The dugout’s walls are amazingly colorful covered with
graffiti and spray paint art A lot of it is people’s names
and gang tags - where they are from names names of
couples a few political slogans One reads “USA Lies”

Kengo walks over and picks up the can of spray paint

He shakes it then holds his hand out and sprays The very
last bit of red pant weekly spurts onto Kengo’s hand

He throws the can as hard as he can It clangs loudly against
the car

Kengo walks over to the wall and presses his hand against it
He bangs his fist on top of his hand making sure it’s pressed
against the wall hard Satisfied he gently removes his hand
He backs up admiring his work

ON THE WALL

Kengo’s fresh bright red hand print shimmers among the older
graffiti The newest piece in years and layers of paint

ON THE FIELD

Kengo walks out into the field and sits down He lies on his
back and looks up at the sky

KENGO’S POV

In stark contrast to Kengos terrestrial surrounds the sky
is beautiful in the full blush of an amazing sunset

Orange and pink clouds streak through the sky A jet a mile
up leaves a contrail that turns orange It engines make a
distinct static roar

ABOVE KENGO (SKY’S POV)

We float above the field looking down at Kengo stretched out
on his back looking up at the sky We descend towards him
As we reach him he raises his arms up and opens his hands
against the sunset sky

KENGO’S POV

He holds his hands together like a frame He makes the sound
of a picture being taken

Kengo reaches into his pocket and pulls out his iPod and
turns it on

He finds the right music to look at the sky with
Something ambient and atmospheric but delicate

Kengo gets tired of the song and looking at the sky He jumps
up and changes the music to something with a faster tempo

Kengo starts to dance along to the music It’s his trademark
flapping frog-like dancing It’s weird and jerky

We swirl around him as he flaps along to the music
Suddenly the music stops

Kengo stops dancing and checks out his iPod He bangs it on
his hand

The batteries are dead
WIDE ON THE BASEBALL DIAMOND
Kengo stands on top of the pitchers mound softly humming

The wind picks up as the sun sets

Kengo stops humming and listens A guest of wind clangs the
chain link fence making a strange rhythm

Kengo moves to the weird clang of the fence He stars to hum
again a little louder

He starts moving a little more swaying back and forth then a
little faster He spins around and jumps in the air
His movements evolve slowly into a dance There is a little
bit of his frog movements but they diminish as his movements
become more and more fluid The fence clangs the wind blows
a distant siren howls Kengo dances along

ANGLE ON THE FIELD

Kengo runs to one side of the lot and does some dancing then
to the other side He runs around the baseball diamond
following where the bases would be an imaginary home run

After home base he runs to the abandoned car and jumps on
the roof

On the roof of the car he goes wild dancing and jumping with
unprecedented grace at least for him

He rips his shirt off and waves it around like a flag before
throwing it down He takes his pants off and whips them
through the air

He continues dancing but now it’s taken on an almost
religious feel

Kengo is in the middle of some huge personal ritual He is
sweating and moving wildly dancing to his own music He is
purging something deep from inside him

Kengo leaps off the car and runs back to the pitcher’s mound
His dancing crescendos in a flurry of wild movements and
then Kengo collapses onto the ground hyperventilating

ANGLE - ABOVE THE BASEBALL DIAMOND

The light has drained from the sky and the world has taken on
a bluish color

Kengo lies on the pitcher’s mound catching his breath

We slowly float down to him

There is a strange sorrowful compliance in him

He sighs a long sigh and then takes the deepest of breaths

KENGO
Oh God
A large gust of wind whistles hauntingly through the rusty
chain-link fence like it’s answering him

Kengo starts to cry

The last light of the day drains from the sky

Slow dissolve to

INT BUS - NIGHT

Kengo rides the bus It’s dark outside and the fluorescent
lights in the bus are bright There are only a few other
passengers They all ride in silence

Slow dissolve to

INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT

Kengo gets off the subway at Vermont and Wilshire and rides
the very long escalator up to street level

Slow dissolve to

EXT WILSHIRE BLOULVARD - NIGHT

It’s raining lightly and the streets are slick reflecting
the headlights of the traffic Fog has rolled in and the

streetlights radiate an eerie glow

Kengo walks along the sidewalk slowly and contemplatively as
Korea Town swirls around him

An OLD MAN sells flowers from a little kiosk
Kengo stops at the flower stand

The homeless man with the American flag on his shopping cart
walks by singing The Star Spangled Banner

The Star Spangled Banner echoes slowly dissolving over
EXT SMALL HOUSE - NIGHT

This mid-century house in a suburban neighborhood is just on
the edge of K-Town
Kengo walks across the street and stops in front of the
house He holds a small bouquet of daisies

Kengo makes a loud chirp His signal to Sandra There is no
response so he chirps again Still nothing

KENGO
(loud whisper)
Sandra

A light in the house goes on

A MAN 50’S (Sandra’s father) opens the front door He stares
at Kengo

Sandra is obviously not home Kengo walks away
INT KENGO AND EVELYN’S APT - NIGHT

Kengo quietly opens up the front door He carries the bouquet
of daisies He steps into the hall trying not to make the
floor creak It’s like a mine field but he’s well practiced
at maneuvering through it If Evelyn is sleeping he doesn’t
want to wake her

Music begins playing from the living room It’s haunting and
beautiful Maybe traditionally Asian

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Sandra drives her Volvo up to the front of Kengo’s building
She is wearing Kengo’s hat She takes a hand off the wheel to
honk the horn but stops herself She turns the igniting off
and sits there for a moment in the quiet She takes a tissue
from the dashboard and blows her nose

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Sandra gets out of her car She stares up at Kengo’s
building Her eyes are puffy from crying

INT KENGO AND EVELYN’S APT - NIGHT

Kengo walks down the hall forgetting to close the front door
KENGO’S POV

Floating towards the living room and the source of the music
Slowly we round the doorway revealing

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Evelyn dances slowly around the room to the music She is
dressed in a beautiful silk nightgown seeming to almost defy
gravity with her grace totally uninhabited

Kengo sets the daisies down next to the record player He
leans against the door and watches Evelyn hypnotised Her
dance is almost mournful

Evelyn turns and sees Kengo She smiles at him dancing
slowly using the whole room as her stage

Kengo starts to sway to the music He steps into the room and
dances slowly in place

Evelyn reaches her arms out inviting Kengo to dance with her

Kengo smiles and pushes himself off the wall toward her
Evelyn embraces Kengo and they begin to dance together
around the room

Sandra quietly steps into the doorway peering into the
living room Kengo’s red ski hat is in her hand

Kengo sees Sandra over Evelyn’s shoulder and keeping Evelyn’s
back to Sandra he looks at her He can see she’s been
crying

Sandra watches Kengo and Evelyn’s intimate dance The hat
slips out of her hand

Kengo gently takes Evelyn’s hands from himself and steps out
of her embrace

Evelyn turns and sees Sandra She stops dancing
Kengo walks across the room toward Sandra He picks his hat

up from the floor and places it on Sandra’s head Kengo
reaches his hand out to Sandra

Sandra takes a small hesitant step towards Kengo and he takes
her in his arms and guides her into the room Kengo leads
her gracefully into his dance They use the full space of
the room moving through it effortlessly

Evelyn takes a step back and watches

Sandra closes her eyes and hugs Kengo harder The tension in
her face relaxes They press their bodies together tightly

Evelyn turns away and dances slowly in her corner of the
room her back to Kengo and Sandra

Freeze Frame
The music continues

Fade Out

THE END

EPILOGUE - OVER THE END CREDITS
Kengo’s music
Under the end credits we fade up to
The photo Kengo took on the bus
The old woman is blurry but we can tell she is smiling
Behind her THE MAN is standing His head is almost
completely out of frame We can’t see his eyes nose or any
of his face But we can see the bottom of his profile and

as we slowly zoom in his ear

Fade out
