EXT MID-EASTERN LANDSCAPE - VALLEY OF THE KINGS DAY

This is a valley surrounded by craggy canyons In the
midst of the valley are spiraling rock formations and
several cracked and fallen stone monoliths showing faces of
ancient kings A lone HAWK circles the valley (this we
will discover is our villain)

The extreme quiet of the Valley of the Kings is broken by
the distant sound of metal scraping and colliding with
stone The natives look around for the source of the noise
CLASH CLASH the colliding continues

ANGLE ON CANYON - the scraping and colliding gets louder
Something is speeding through the canyon getting closer
WHOOSH an airplane flies out of the narrow canyon its
wings perpendicular to the ground The belly of the plane
scrapes against one of the canyon walls

SIDEWAYS ANGLE ON COCKPIT - Yes the pilot of the plane is
LAUNCHPAD The other passengers are SCROOGE HUEY DEWEY
LOUIE and WEBBY Scrooge and the boys hold on for their

lives Webby puts her hands over her eyes afraid to look

SCROOGE and KIDS
Fearful Who-o-o-a

SCROOGE
Launchpad is this a stunt
you learned in flight school

LAUNCHPAD
Flight school

SCROOGE
You mean you never took
flying lessons

LAUNCHPAD
Well I took a crash course

SCROOGE
Now he tells me

WIDE ON VALLEY OF THE KINGS
Launchpad’s plane flies out of the canyon and swoops over
the valley to the amazement of onlookers

EXT ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG - CONTINUOUS

The plane approaches an archaeological dig at the far side
of the Valley of the Kings Diggers are at work The
nephews and Webby look out the window of the plane at the
dig

DEWEY
There’s the dig Uncle
Scrooge

LOUIE

Did they say what they found

SCROOGE
Aye A hidden chamber

HUEY
You think it might have the
treasure of Collie Baba and
his forty thieves

SCROOGE
After all this time I’m not
getting my hopes up

BELOW

A group of Diggers is pulling on a pulley-rope systen
‘drawing up something from a large hole in the ground As
Launchpad’s plane passes over the Diggers they look up and
wave excitedly

DIGGERS
(ad lib shouts
some in Arabic)
It’s Scrooge
McDuckHereOver here Mr
McDuck over here

One of the Diggers DIJON a shifty-looking dog-nose with
big buggy eyes and big ears does not join in the shouts but
instead looks up in the opposite direction

DIJON’S POV - High on a canyon stands a dark figure ina
cowled robe This we will learn is MERLOCK He looks
down upon the scene with the solemnity of the grim reaper

BACK ON PLANE - It circles around still flying
perpendicular to the ground

LAUNCHPAD
We’re making our final
approach Please put your
seat-backs in their upright
positions
SCROOGE
Just put the plane in an
upright position

Launchpad levels the plane and sends it swooping down toward
the dig The plane hits the sand bounces a few times then
skids Members of the archaeological dig scramble to get
out of the way of the skidding plane

DIGGERS
worried wallas

LAUNCHPAD (VO)
Landing gear down and locked

Launchpad hits the brakes hard as the plane skids toward one
of the huge stone monoliths The plane finally jerks to a
stop barely tapping the monolith

Suddenly the monolith starts to teeter and finally falls
over onto another nearby monolith The monoliths fall like
dominoes all around the valley When the dust settles
there isn’t a statue of a King left standing

LAUNCHPAD
Woops

SCROOGE
Launchpad look what you’ve
done to these ancient ruins

LAUNCHPAD
Well it could have been
worse It could have been
something new

Scrooge does a mortified burn

Members of the Diggers run over to greet Scrooge help him
out of the plane

DIGGER
Hurry Mr McDuck We’ve
found something

ON EXCAVATION HOLE - Scrooge and his group surround the
hole where some of the crew is still cranking the pulley
At the end of the rope appears a golden ark-like chest
It’s an ornate piece of work with a collie-nose Arabian
etched on the lid Scrooge steps closer to see (NOTE
except for Dijon the Diggers are an emotional bunch that
react in unison)
SCROOGE

Bless me bagpipes -- an
engraving of Collie Baba

(glancing toward

the kids)
This could very well be the
treasure chest of the
greatest thief who ever
lived

Dijon’s eyes widen as the Diggers become excited

DIGGERS
Excited wallas

The crew lifts the chest over to the side and Scrooge
examines the ancient rope seal that holds the lid closed

He sticks his cane behind the rope and pulls it loose the
ancient rotted rope falls apart easily Scrooge flips open
the lid For a second he and the others gaze into the chest
with great expectation

DIGGERS
Gasp of anticipation

Then a look of disappointment comes over them as Scrooge
begins to pull out old robes one after the other

DIGGERS
sigh of disappointment)
Awwwww

Faster and faster Scrooge pulls out the robes looking for a
genuine treasure

A robe falls near Dijon who picks it up and looks toward
Merlock with a sorrowful shrug

Merlock looks down with a scowl

When Scrooge reaches the bottom he slumps with
disappointment

SCROOGE
Och nothing but old robes

Scrooge throws the last robe to the ground in disgust

SCROOGE
Forty years of searching and
I end up with Collie Baba’s
irty laundry
WEBBY
At least the box is pretty
Uncle Scrooge

The Diggers try to cheer up Scrooge too nodding in
agreement One rubs the lid appreciatively

DIGGERS
YesThat’s rightvery nice

Louie notices a piece of rolled parchment sticking from one
of the robes

LOUIE
Hey there’s something in
this pocket

Louie holds the parchment up before Scrooge who reacts to
its seal

SCROOGE
The seal of Collie Baba

The crew perks up interested again Dijon’s head juts in

DIGGERS
Wallas of interest

Scrooge opens the parchment and scans it excited

SCROOGE
It’s a map

The Diggers share looks of excitement Dijon’s eyes widen

CREW
Coooo

The nephews crowd around trying to read the map
SCROOGE
Maybe this dig isn’t a lost

cause after all

Scrooge heads off the Diggers following Only one person
remains behind -- Dijon who again glances up nodding to

DIGGERS
Wallas

ON MERLOCK - watching from his perch He smiles evilly as
he catches Dijon’s nod

DISSOLVE TO
HOURS LATER - NEAR EXCAVATION SITE

The sun is setting casting eerie shadows over the ancient
ruins Dijon is meeting with Merlock who toys with a
distinctive talisman that he wears on a necklace

DIJON
(excitedly)
That’s right Merlock a
treasure map written in
Collie Baba’s own hand

Merlock clenches his fists in exaltation

MERLOCK
At last After all these
centuries the lamp will be
mine again

DIJON
(beaming)
Yes yes You will become
more powerful than
(searching)

-- locomotive More faster
than speedy bull You will
leap all buildings ina
single town

MERLOCK
And you shall finally be
rewarded for yourdubious
assistance

DIJON
(brightening)
You mean it My mountain of
money

Merlock extends an open palm

MERLOCK
Yes Now give it to me

DIJON
It What it

MERLOCK
The map Give it to me

DIJON
The map That specific map
Right here Right now
Merlock grabs Dijon by the front of his shirt and lifts him
off his feet

MERLOCK
You didn’t steal it

DIJON
gleep Too many people
Merlock Only one Dijon
(suddenly
brightening)
B-but look what I did steal -

Dijon starts pulling out items as he speaks (Note The
Gate nut bar should be half-eaten)

DIJON
Several billfolds this dandy
pocket watch floss a date
nut bar and two tickets to
the Feta Cheese Festival

He gingerly tucks the tickets into Merlock’s robe and pats
them

DIJON (CONT)
For you master

A sneering Merlock throws him OS where we hear a painful
CRASH

MERLOCK
Bah

DIJON
Big cry of pain

We see Dijon is covered in rubble He Gazedly throws off
the stones mumbling

DIJON
Maybe you’d like the floss

Merlock looks down disdainfully at Dijon
MERLOCK
Did you at least see where

the map leads

Dijon comes limping in looking disheveled
DIJON
Yes master Yes Into the
middle of the desert - where
the sand burns like a hot
kabob

Merlock scowls as he looks out at the desert

MERLOCK
But I searched every square
inch
(smiling coyly)
Perhaps this time I’11 let
Scrooge do the searching for
me

Dijon who has been collecting the fallen billfolds and
cash looks up brightly

DIJON
Ho smart move master Let
him boil out his brains in
the sun

MERLOCK
And you shall accompany him
as his guide

DIJON
whimper But I have such
sensitive skin And my brain
boils so quickly
Merlock leans in with a sneer Dijon immediately cowers
DIJON
But who needs brains to be a
guide anyway
And Dijon backs off bowing reverently
Merlock heads away into the shadows saying
MERLOCK
Good 1’11 see you on the
way to the treasure

Dijon’s eyes turn upward as we hear the sound of WINGS
FLUTTERING A quick shadow passes over

DIJON’S POV - the hawk we saw at the opening of the show
flutters away

DISSOLVE TO
EXT DESERT - DAY

Blistering sun shines down on a terrain of rolling sand
dunes A procession of camels moves across the desert
carrying Scrooge the nephews Webby and Launchpad Dijon
leads the group He looks very haggard as he wipes his brow
with his turban and wrings the perspiration over his head
Scrooge wears a pith helmet reading the map as he bounces
along The nephews are wearing French Foreign Legion-type
desert hats riding a rare three-humped camel Webby is
shading herself with a parasol as she rides a baby camel

Launchpad who is dressed in an Hawaiian-print shirt and
Bermuda shorts is getting a rough ride having the
bounciest camel of all

LAUNCHPAD
Gee Mr McDee a plane ride
would have been less
turbulent

Scrooge holds up the map showing a mountain (with a facial
appearance) and the X’d treasure location When he takes
away the map the same mountain can be seen in the bg
matching the map perfectly

SCROOGE
According to the map the
Cave of Collie Baba should be
right here -- under the gaze
of Mount Badude

Wider to show there’s nothing but sand as far as the eye can
see

HUEY
I don’t see anything Uncle
Scrooge

DEWEY

Not even a mirage
As he speaks Launchpad’s camel trips on a pointed rock

LAUNCHPAD
Maybe we took the wrong turn
at that last sand dune
(pitching forward)
Whoa

Launchpad’s camel keels over face first throwing
Launchpad

CAMEL
HONK

SCROOGE
Launchpad canna you even
ride a camel without crashing
it

CLOSER ON LAUNCHPAD - he steps over to a pointed rock
(pyramid shaped) sticking out of the sand

LAUNCHPAD
It’s not my fault Humpy
here just had a great fall
We must have hit this lousy
rock

He angrily kicks the rock away but it doesn’t budge

LAUNCHPAD
Yeouch

As Launchpad grabs his aching foot the nephews climb off
their camel and examine the strange little pyramid sticking
out of the ground

LOUIE
Gee it looks like a pint-
sized pyramid

The boys start digging the sand away from the pyramid with
their hands The stone goes deeper into the ground

DEWEY
Quackaroonie It’s bigger
than it looks

HUEY
I wonder what’s inside

Scrooge gets off his camel to investigate bringing shovels
along

SCROOGE
There’s only one way to find
out lads

ON DIJON also off his camel and using his turban to fan his
face Scrooge also thrusts a shovel at hin

SCROOGE (CONT)
Start digging
As Scrooge exits Dijon looks in complete dispair

ON PYRAMID TOP - as the shovels are dug in one by one
scooping away the sand

DISSOLVE TO

ON SUN - HOURS AND HOURS LATER
PAN DOWN to catch top of the pyramid which has been cleared
of sand

WIDEN and PAN down to show that our group has dug a hole so
big and wide that it reveals practically the entire side of
a large ornate pyramid Scrooge and company are small
figures at the bottom

The hawk has landed on the pyramid and gazes down with
piercing eyes

BELOW - ON SCROOGE holding his pince-nez as he squints at
hieroglyphics

SCROOGE
If I read these hieroglyphics
correctly

FAVORING THE OTHERS as they listen Dijon who is
completely wiped is propped on his shovel and is slowly
sliding down the handle

SCROOGE (VO CONT)
We may have found the
entrance

FAVORING SCROOGE who places his hand on an engraving in the
brick and twists it

Suddenly part of the stone facade slides up revealing an
opening SFX GRINDING STONE

bet

e HH
ON OTHERS FAVORING DIJON whose eyes widen in astonishment
He slowly rises up the shovel handle at the same speed that
the pyramid door is opening as if pulled by the same
invisible string Everyone is transfixed

ON MERLOCKHAWK who also looks down in astonishment

BACK ON THE ENTRANCE Scrooge steps up to a wall sconce
just inside the entrance pulls out a torch and lights it
with a match He turns to the others who step in from
behind and says

SCROOGE
All right Let’s go

INT PYRAMID

Our heroes and Dijon step inside making their way down a
stone stairway Dijon and Launchpad carry lighted torches
GIANT STONE FROGS line both sides of the corridor

SCROOGE
Careful Stay close Webby
No telling what kind of
dangers we might find

LAUNCHPAD
Looks safe to me

Launchpad strides forward tripping over a raised brick with
a Collie Baba insignia As he falls forward a burst of
flame shoots out from the wall WHOOSH barely missing him
Everyone reacts

EVERYONE
gasp

LOUIE
It’s a Collie Baba boobie
trap

As Dewey digs the Jr Woodchuck’s Guide Book out of their
kKnapsack Huey asks

FH

e e

HUEY
What’s the Jr Woodchuck
Guide Book say about booby
traps

DEWEY
(scanning)
It says stay alert and use
your marbles

Huey holds up a bag of marbles

HUEY
Good thing I brought some

WEBBY
(pointing)
There’s another one

And far ahead we see another raised brick with an insignia
Dewey flips a marble ahead and it strikes a slightly angled
brick on the floor The brick falls flat into place and
suddenly TONGUES from the STONE FROGS whip and CRACK like
bullwhips Dijon jumps into Scrooge’s arms in fright

DIJON
That could have been quite a
tongue lashing

Scrooge pushes him forward

SCROOGE
Just keep the light ahead of
us

ON DIJON as he fearfully steps past the others

DIJON
(Whimperingly)
Maybe one of the children
might be wanting to hold the
torch

Just then he almost steps on another trigger on the floor
He JUMPS BACK as he hears

EVERYONE ELSE (0S)
Look out

DIJON
Terrified scream

FAVORING DIJON AND THE NEPHEWS - Dijon sees what he almost
stepped on and immediately regains his confidence
DIJON
Do not fear

He reaches over and grabs a handful of marbles from
whichever Nephew is holding the bag

ON DIJON as he steps up to the trap and gets ready to throw
the marbles

DIJON
(big)
Dijon shall trip the trap

He throws the marbles with a defiant air

DIJON
(defiantly)
Ha

Somehow he misses The marbles go BOUNCING OS Dijon
momentarily looks mortified

DIJON
Missed

He then lifts a leg and stretches it over to trigger the
brick with his big toe He cringes as he CLICKS the brick
and quickly pulls back his leg

Suddenly a giant wheel comes rolling by barely missing him
Dijon TAKES After it’s OS he looks toward the others
appearing very pleased with himself

DIJON
You see

The wheel curves around to hit him CRASH

The others looks on in horror as the cylinder starts to
crack down the middle It finally falls away into two
halves revealing a completely dazed Dijon who starts
weaving about

DIJON
Oooohhhhhhh Is there a
doctor in the pyramid

As he leans against the wall (or a statue) he triggers yet
another engraving Suddenly a giant trap door opens up
underneath all of them and they fall through

DUCKS DIJON
(Cry of alarm)

INT UNDERGROUND CHUTE
We follow them as they tumble down a circuitous stone chute

DUCKSDIJON (CONT)
cries as they tumble

UNDERGROUND CHAMBER

The chute opens out onto an underground chamber Dijon is
the first to fall to the floor with a THUD Everyone else
falls on top of him Huey who holds the marble bag is the
last

DUCKSDIJON
(individual)
Umph

Suddenly one of the marbles bounces from the bag down the
pile of people and toward a great stone wall In front of
the wall is another brick with an insignia and a small slot
As the marble bounces toward it the others raise their
heads apprehensively

The marble hits the brick and slides into the slot

The others become bugeyed as they expect the worse to
happen

EVERYONE
Oh no gasp

Suddenly the wall swivels around It turns out to be a
perfectly balanced stone slab which opens onto a huge
cavern Our group steps up and gazes with awe

INSIDE THE CAVERN

is a bridge made of reed that stretches over a drop of at
least a hundred feet The bridge leads to a wide stone
cylinder sticking up from the middle of the cavern On top
of the cylinder sits a large reed bowl filled with a pile of
fabulous treasure Scrooge can hardly believe his eyes

SCROOGE
Och jump start me heart
The treasure

He starts rushing across the bridge followed by Dewey and
the others Dijon looking wide-eyed places his lit torch
on a nearby sconce and follows after
NEPHEWS LAUNCHPADWEBBY
Ad lib Whoops and
shouts of elation)
Neato Hey Baba’s
baubles Wow etc

Scrooge picks up a dog-nosed headpiece made of gold and
holds it up triumphantly speaking to it

SCROOGE
Hee-hee Collie Baba you
old dog I finally found it

Dewey plucks out a diamond the size of a football When he
looks at it closely his eyeball appears in every crystal
face Meanwhile Webby plucks out a jewel-encrusted hand
mirror to look at herself When Launchpad reaches into the
pile and pulls out his hand not only is he holding a bar of
gold but his wrist is bedecked with dozens of bangles his
fingers adorned in rings

Meanwhile Dijon sneakily steps over reaches for some of
the gems and speedily pockets them While doing this he
sees the prize he’s been looking for - an OIL LAMP -
sticking out the pile

At the same time Louie is sifting through the coins when
one rolls off the pile He grabs it just before it rolls
over the edge That’s when he notices something below

LOUIE
(fearfully)
Oh Un-Uncle Scrooge

LOUIE’S POV Down below in a pit perhaps forty feet
are GIANT SCORPIONS SNAPPING their pincers

As Scrooge and the others look down
LAUNCHPAD
Whoa Sumo wrestlin’
scorpions
Meanwhile Dijon slowly creeps over to grab the lamp
SCROOGE (0S)
Dunna worry We’re safe up

here (calling out) Dijon

Dijon quickly pulls back as Scrooge turns to him

DIJON
What What I’m not
touching a thing I’m clean
Innocent Like baby goat

SCROOGE
Go get the sacks

DIJON
Sacks Oh yes sacks
Right away Anything you
say Scrooge sir I do for
you

He takes one last longing look at the lamp before he
scurries away As Dijon crosses the bridge and is about to
re-enter the corridor he suddenly notices the handle of a
pulley device in the shadows It’s connected to a chain
which is wrapped around stone gears and leads to a hole next
to the pillar He takes note with a wry smile and then
moves on

LOUIE (0S)
Where are you going to keep
all this treasure Uncle
Scrooge

Meanwhile back on the platform Scrooge is using a
jeweler’s eyepiece to gaze at a ruby bigger than his head

SCROOGE
Oh I won’t keep it all
Louie Most of these
artifacts will go to museums

The nephews turn to one another

LOUIE
That doesn’t sound like Uncle
Scrooge

SCROOGE

That way I can enjoy a hefty
tax break

HUEY
That does

Just then Webby pulls out the LAMP that Dijon noticed
earlier

WEBBY
Looky looky A tea pot

Scrooge comes over He BLOWS dust off it and gives it a
cursory glance

SCROOGE
BLOWS Och just an old
oil lamp Hardly worth
taking

WEBBY
May I have it Uncle Scrooge
I can use it for my tea set

SCROOGE
(hedging)
Well

Webby picks up a jeweled crown

WEBBY
‘Course this is pretty too

Scrooge quickly hands back the lamp which Webby is happy to
take

SCROOGE
Here my dear Dunna say
your Uncle Scrooge never gave
you anything

WEBBY
Thanks

She gives him a big hug then stuffs it into her shoulder
bag aS we

WIPE TO

INT CAVERN

Everyone is standing around the now empty reed bowl as
Scrooge finishes scooping the last of the riches into a huge
sack that Launchpad and Huey hold open

SCROOGE
That’s the last of it
HUEY
Think you can carry it
Launchpad

Dauntless he throws the enormous sack over his shoulder

LAUNCHPAD
(straining)
No problem-o
But the weight causes him to careen backwards to the edge of
the scorpion pit

LAUNCHPAD (CONT)
Whoa-oa-oa

Dijon looks horrified by the near loss of the treasure and
rushes in to stop Launchpad

DIJON
Shriek Don’t lose it

LAUNCHPAD
Whew Thanks Dijon

With a sly look Dijon grabs the sack

DIJON
(very sly)
Here Let me take a load off
your feet

Dijon then gives Launchpad a swift kick sending him over
the side

DIJON
Oops

LAUNCHPAD
Ad lib cry of surprise

Launchpag manages to grab onto the edge with one hand as the
others run up

SCROOGENEPHEWS WEBBY
(ad lib shouts)
Awk Launchpad Hold on

As they pull Launchpad up Dijon scrambles like mad
dragging the sack behind him The bridge creaks and sags
from the weight By the time he reaches the middle it’s
all up hill and slow going

DIJON
Grunts

Then a large hand reaches down and grabs the sack from hin

MERLOCK
Allow me

Merlock lifts the sack effortlessly and rushes back across
the bridge Dijon following

As Launchpad is finally pulled out Louie points toward the
bridge

LOUIE
Hey who’s that guy

By now Merlock and Dijon have reached the other side
Merlock dumps the sack onto Dijon - CRUNCH - and turns
snidely toward our group while pulling the burning torch
from the sconce

MERLOCK
Just another tour guide Let
me light your path

Scrooge starts heading over the bridge in alarm

SCROOGE
I smell a couple of desert
rats

Merlock throws the torch on the bridge Immediately it
burns The fire spreads so quickly that Scrooge is unable
to get past it

SCROOGE
Och

Suddenly the burning section STARTS TO TEAR The boys
react

NEPHEWS
Uncle Scrooge

Scrooge backs up but it’s too late The bridge SNAPS
Scrooge holds onto his side as it swings down SLAPPING
against the side of the cylinder

The scorpions gather around interested their pincers
SNAPPING

The flames quickly shoot up licking Scrooge’s backside and
forcing him to scramble back onto the top

HUEY (VO)
Hurry

SCROOGE
AWK

Everyone stands back from the intensity of the heat as the
flames flare up in a brief but dramatic conflagration that
totally consumes the rest of the reed bridge Scrooge
shakes a fist at Merlock and Dijon who watch from the
corridor entrance

SCROOGE
You thieving dogs I’ve
spent most of my life
searching for that treasure

MERLOCK
I know In one lifetime you
have succeeded where I have
failed in a hundred

And then coldly cruelly Merlock pulls the chain

MERLOCK
(snide)
Congratulations

Suddenly there is a RUMBLING and the cylindrical pillar
starts to descend As our heroes react again the giant
SNAPPING scorpions move toward the pillar with interest

SCROOGE
Oooh I knew that weasel’s
prices were too good to be

true DELETE
Merlock and a struggling Dijon pull away the sacks EXITING
The boys look down at the snapping Scorpions with concern

DEWEY

What are we gonna do
NEPHEWS POV as the Scorpions get closer
ON SCROOGE who is looking down worriedly Suddenly he
notices he ropes tying the reed bowl to its base He points
at a rope with his cane
SCROOGE
Cut the ropes lads Hurry
Immediately the boys get out their pocket knives and start

slicing at the three ropes

The top of the cylinder is but a few feet from the ground as
they continue cutting the rope underneath Launchpad is
trying to pry the bowl off

HUEY
Hurry Louie

Meanwhile Scrooge is swinging his cane at a giant scorpion
which is trying to climb up the cylinder Webby jabs her
closed parasol at another one

WEBBY
Shoo Shoo

Just as the cylinder reaches the bottom the bowl is free
Launchpad turns it over and motions everyone underneath

LAUNCHPAD
Quick make like turtles

A giant scorpion is just about to sting Webby as they
scramble underneath

LAUNCHPAD (VO)
Forward ho

The bowl goes forward the scorpions SNAPPING at it with
their pinchers The bowl SMASHES against a wall

EVERYONE
UMPHS AND OUCHES

LAUNCHPAD (VO)
Reverse Ho

The bowl goes backwards smashes against a rock

EVERYONE
UMPHS AND OUCHES

LAUNCHPAD (VO)
Sideways ho

The bowl goes sideways hits another wall

EVERYONE
MORE UMPHS AND OUCHES

Finally they start heading across the canyon floor

SCROOGE (VO)
Launchpad if you donna quit
crashing I’m going to give
you the heave-ho

They head through a narrow pass between two stalagmites
Scorpions follow in single file Just then UNDERGROUND
WATER is heard

HUEY (VO)
Hey do you hear somethin’

They come to the edge of the river and lift the lid

Slightly Eyes appear in the darkness of the bowl to see if
the coast is clear

SCROOGE
Quick let’s turn this over
and make a boat

Only one scorpion is after them anda Scrooge fends it off
with his cane while the others turn over the bowl and hop
aboard

WEBBY
Hurry Uncle Scrooge hurry

Scrooge leaps aboard and they’re off Meanwhile

XT PYRAMID
Dijon is emptying the sack of jewels giddy with success

DIJON
It’s here Master I saw it
Wait ‘til you see it you’ll
be pleased as pop

Dijon has emptied the last sack No lamp He sticks his
head in the sack to look for it Merlock sneers at Dijon
who cowers nervously

MERLOCK
Well Where is it

DIJON
It must be here It must

Merlock grabs Dijon by the neck

MERLOCK
You have it don’t you

Merlock lifts Dijon holds him upside down and shakes hin
like a bean bag All kinds of treasure items start falling
out

DIJON (CONT)
CRY OF ALARM

As the last piece falls out Merlock hisses

MERLOCK
(enraged)
Where-is-the-lamp

Dijon points toward the opening of the pyramid

DIJON
They must have it They
must Those dirty thieves
And such sweet children I
ask you Merlock what is the
world coming to

Merlock drops him in a huff

DIJON (CONT)
WAH

MERLOCK
You let them steal it from
you you pathetic pickpocket

That said the furious Merlock grabs his talisman and turns
into a hawk before our eyes He flies toward the cave as
the cowering Dijon rises to follow However he can’t help
to repocket a few items first
DIJON
Don’t worry Merlock I will
help you get it back No
trouble You bet Here I
come

He takes a couple of steps and suddenly spots a sparkling
diamond which he pockets (During the rest of the dialogue
he stops and goes always finding something irresistible in
his path)

DIJON (CONT)
Oh yes Right behind you
(sees something
else)
Oooh wait I mean don’t
wait Dijon is on his way
(something big)
Wo Mama

BACK IN THE CAVERN
The bowl moves down river through a wonderland of rock
formations Scrooge looks dismayed

LAUNCHPAD
I’d like to know where this
leads

Suddenly Huey points ahead nervously

HUEY
I’m not so sure you do

Ahead we see that the underground river narrows and slopes
down becoming rapids as it rushes toward a tunnel

SCROOGELAUNCHPADKIDS
Cries of alarm

The bowl rushes through the rapids With a WHOOSH they
disappear into the tunnel

SCROOGELAUNCHPADKIDS (CONT)
(clipped off at
end)
Cry of alarm

ANGLE ON CAVERN ENTRANCE - Just as the Merlock hawk flies
in He soars about the guiet cavern looking around

INT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL
Our heroes shoot rapids through a winding twisting tunnel

EVERYONE
Screams of alarm

As they continue the tunnel becomes smaller and smaller
until it’s not much bigger than the bowl itself The
tunnel in effect is heading into an underground stream
As Launchpad speaks the reed bowl fills with water and the
head room in the tunnel becomes practically non-existent

LAUNCHPAD
(shouting)
I hate to be an alarmist but
IT’S BEEN NICE KNOWIN’ YA

Suddenly our heroes completely disappear underwater

EVERYONE
Clipped Scream

EXT ARABIAN RIVER OASIS (CONTINUOUS)
All is quiet on a Nile-like river running through an palm
tree OASIS terrain where DOG-NOSE ARABS are peacefully

eating on their dhows (Arabian boats) Suddenly pop pop
pop Up pop Scrooge’s pith helmet and the nephews’ foreign
legion hats then afterwards - WHOOSH - the reed bowl

SPRINGS up from the water A beat later all our heroes pop
up gasping from their underwater ride

EVERYONE
Sputters and gasps

DEWEY
Whoa What a ride

LOUIE
Yeah I wouldn’t mind doing
it again now that I know you
can live through it

By now Launchpad Webby and Huey are stepping from the water
onto the bank

LAUNCHPAD
At least we’re all okay

Scrooge scowls as he steps up to the bank

SCROOGE
Speak for yourself I just
lost the treasure of the
century

As Scrooge plops down with a scowl Webby sympathizes She
pulis out her lamp and pours out the water
WEBBY
Here Uncle Scrooge You can
have this back if it’ll make
you feel better

SCROOGE
That’s all right dear
(grimly)

BACK IN THE CAVERN

A nervous-looking Dijon slowly shuffles up to the cavern
entrance holding up his pants The pockets bulge so much
it looks as if he’s wearing jodhpurs He looks around

DIJON
Hellooo Merlock Scrooge
(very puzzled)
Where is everybody

Just then Merlock the hawk flaps down behind him and
dramatically turns back into normal forn

Dijon is so startled he lets go of his pants which drop to
the floor CLUNK revealing oversized boxer shorts

DIJON
Wah

MERLOCK
(mad as heck)
They have vanished
Dijon quickly reaches down to pull up his pants

DIJON
B-but how

Merlock lifts Dijon by the front of his shirt

MERLOCK
With the lamp you fool

As Merlock speaks he holds Dijon over the pit of SNAPPING
scorpions
MERLOCK (CONT)
And you will help me get it
back or their sting will seem
like a tickle compared with
mine

Dijon tries his best to hold up his sagging pants as gems
and coins fall from his pocket

DIJON
Whimper

And as we leave Dijon in this precarious position we

INT SCROOGE’S OFFICE
Mrs Featherby enters carrying his lunch on a tray Scrooge
is at his desk He looks up with a scowl

SCROOGE
For what

MRS FEATHERBY
(timidly)
I believe they want to ask
what happened with the
treasure

Scrooge angrily picks up the phone

SCROOGE
None of your business

He SLAMS the phone down

SCROOGE
Och Every time I get my
mind off the treasure the
press has to press me about
it again

Mrs Featherby who is clearly walking on egg shells with
Scrooge puts on a hopeful smile as she picks up an envelope
on the tray

MRS FEATHERBY
Well I have some news that
might cheer you up

SCROOGE
What’s that

She hands Scrooge the envelope

Scrooge scowls
cheese

MRS FEATHERBY
You finally received your
invitation to the
Archeological Society Ball

at the envelope as if it were a piece of old

SCROOGE
Och I canna face those old
fossils again Every year I
tell them I’ll find Collie
Baba’s treasure and every
year I come back empty
handed

MRS FEATHERBY
(timidly)

But you did have it for a
little while

Scrooge looks heavenward in despair

Scrooge shoves

EXT MANSION - DAY
PUSH IN as we hear

MRS BEAKLEY (VO)
Here’s the polish Webbigail

INT KITCHEN

The nephews are eating sandwiches at the breakfast nook
table as Mrs Beakley hands Webby a bottle of polish and
some rags

WEBBY
Thanks a lot

As Webby sits down to the table with the bottle rags and
lamp She says to the boys

WEBBY
As soon as I’m done polishing
my tea pot we can have a tea
party with all my dollies

The boys grimace

HUEY
Thanks for the warning

Just then DUCKWORTH steps up to Mrs Beakley

DUCKWORTH
Excuse me ma‘am but I’ve
been summoned to pick up Mr
McDuck

Mrs Beakley looks none-too-happy as they both leave
together

DUCKWORTH (CONT)
Apparently he’s having
another one of his chipper
days

MRS BEAKLEY
Oh dear

As Webby starts polishing the lamp the boys all look at
each other nervously

HUEY
Maybe we’d better play
outside today

Just then the lamp begins to RATTLE in Webby’s hands She
stops

WEBBY
Hey
The boys haven’t seen
LOUIE
What
WEBBY
It shook

She starts rubbing it again trepidatiously It starts to
shake again She pushes it away on the table and jumps back
from her chair

WEBBY
whimper See

This time the boys have seen it They’re instantly curious

HUEY
Quackaroonie
Louie looks inside
LOUIE

There’s nothin’ in it

Dewey picks up a cloth and rubs the lamp vigorously but at
arm’s length Suddenly it really starts shaking and
rattling so much so that it moves around the table a bit

DEWEY
Whoa What is it a Mexican
jumping lamp

The kids grow frightened as the shaking becomes even more
violent Suddenly - VROOSH - an orb’of light BURSTS
through the spout and bounces around the room like a
handball The kids jump under the table

KIDS
Wak

Just then the ball of light ERUPTS into the figure of a
GENIE three-quarters the size of the boys He is
absolutely astonished He straightens his turban as he
looks about

GENIE
Wonder of wonders I’m free
at last SHABOOEY
The kids peer out from the shadow of the breakfast table
They look a bit nervous Louie turns to Dewey

LOUIE
It’s a genie isn’t it

DEWEY
It’s not the tooth fairy

Just then the Genie spots them He’s taken aback

GENIE
gasp Who’re you Where’s
Collie Baba Did Rome fall
yet

The kids crawl cautiously out from under the table

WEBBY
We rubbed the lamp We’re
sorry if we did anything bad

The Genie bows reverently

GENIE
Ah My new masters I’m
eternally grateful

The Genie stretches then shakes his leg

GENIE
Finally there’s room to
stretch My foot’s been
asleep for six centuries

He walks around the room exploring

GENIE
Hey cool casbah Bet this
cost three goats and a pretty
blanket Mind if I look
around

He opens the refrigerator

GENIE
Brrrr A cold food closet
Where do you hang the
chickens

Suddenly something else catches his eye and he hops over to
an electric mixer plugged into the wall and lifts it up As
the kids rush up to him he puts his fingertips to his
temple like a mind reader

GENIE
Wait don’t tell me A rug
beater

HUEY
Egg beater

Genie looks at it with renewed interest

GENIE
Yes I can see
(parries and
thrusts)
Back you foul eggs Back I
say

Suddenly he accidentally STARTS the beater He’s so
startled by it that he drops it and races away

GENIE
Shabooey It’s alive

Louie pulls out the plug stopping the beater as the others
chase after the Genie

DEWEY
Wait come back

The Genie has raced through the swinging kitchen door The
kids follow

FAMILY ROOM
As the kids come racing in They stop near a highbacked
chair and look around

LOUIE
Whered he go

GENIE (0S)
Well whatta ya know

They rush to the sound of the voice

LIBRARY
They find the Genie reading an encyclopedia Other volumes

are at his feet

GENIE
Las Vegas must be some place
if Caesar moved his palace
there
LOUIE
What are you doing

GENIE
Catching up on the twentieth
century

HUEY
You read the whole
encyclopedia

GENIE
From cover to cover to cover
to cover to cover

Genie drops the book and starts spinning the large globe
nearby

GENIE
What’s this A baseball
Bowling ball Cinderella’s

ball

HUEY
No it’s a globe of the
earth

The Genie leaps back astounded

GENIE
Get back You mean the earth
isn’t flat
(grabs book again)
I must’ve missed that part

The kids share looks
LOUIE
He has been in that lamp a
long time

The Genie heads for the door

GENIE
I’ve gotta check this out

Huey grabs the Genie by the arm stops him
HUEY

Wait a second what about our
wishes

GENIE
Wishes Do I look like a
birthday cake

LOUIE
C’mon you can’t fool us
DEWEY
A genie’s supposed to grant
wishes
WEBBY
Yeah three wishes for every
master

Genie snaps his fingers drat

GENIE
Everybody remembers that
part

The kids become excited start crowding around hin

HUEY
So how does it work

OTHER KIDS
(all at once)
C’mon Tell us How do you

do it

GENIE
Okay okay

(demonstrating)

First you have to hold the
lamp

LOUIE
Yeah

GENIE
Then say I wish

HUEY
Yeah

GENIE

Then wish for something
Dewey takes the lamp from him
DEWEY

That’s all Geepers It’s
even user friendly

Louie excitedly takes the lamp from Dewey

LOUIE
I know my first wish I’m
gonna wish for a million

wishes

GENIE
Get serious That never
works

Suddenly Huey is struck by a sour thought

HUEY
Gee I guess one of us ought
to wish for peace and
happiness all over the world

GENIE
Hey these are wishes not
miracles

Webby suddenly brightens

WEBBY
What if we wish for something
like a pet

GENIE
That’s more like it

Webby takes the lamp from Louie

WEBBY
Giggles JI know one I’ve
always wanted
(wishing)
I wish for a baby elephant

Suddenly the Genie’s hands begin to quake a sparkling glow
emanates from them He looks at them nervously

GENIE
(whimpering)
Oh no
GENIE

(strains and whimpers
Whoa)

Genie tries sitting on his hands standing on them pinning
them between his knees He tries everything possible to
contain them but he can’t help but wave them magically
POOF A baby elephant with a big pink bow on its head
appears next to Webby There’s also a doggy collar around
its neck with a leash that extends down into Webby’s hand

GENIE
Shabooey Now look what
youve done

WEBBY
What’s wrong She’s cute

GENIE
Anda big Big wishes always
spell big trouble The
bigger the wish the bigger
the trouble

The nephews share concerned looks

LOUIE
He’s right One look at that
elephant and Uncle Scrooge
will want to know what’s up

GENIE
Everyone who sees it will
And before you know it
they’ll all be fighting over
me the wishes will get out
of control and I’11l end up
being buried in the lamp for
another thousand years

LOUIE
Geepers I hadn’t thought of
that

GENIE

So please pleeeeeze make
small wishes

Just then everyone hears Mrs Beakley approaching

MRS BEAKLEY
Humming a ditty

The Genie POOFS to half-size and hides behind Huey

HUEY
Uh oh it’s our nanny

LOUIE
Hurry hide the elephant

DEWEY
(sarcastically)
Oh yeah like where

Before they can do anything Mrs Beakley steps into the room
carrying a dust mop and sees the elephant

MRS BEAKLEY
Oh-my-God-I-just-saw-an-
elephant scream

Beakley bolts from the room Her scream startles the
elephant it trumpets and scrambles to the end of the room
pulling Webby off her feet by the leash

ELEPHANT
trumpet
WEBBY
Ahhh
The elephant rams against the wall trying to get out
Shelves crack Books fall Genie looks distraught
GENIE
Shabooey I’m in trouble
already

Meanwhile something outside the window catches Dewey’s
eyes It’s Scrooge coming up the walkway

DEWEY
Uh oh We all are

EXT FRONT DOOR
Just as Scrooge is about to reach the door Mrs Beakley
throws it open sees him and gestures wildly

MRS BEAKLEY
(crazed
breathless)
Help Elephant Pink
Hurry

She drags him into the house

SCROOGE
Wak

BACK IN THE LIBRARY

Meanwhile the elephant is now climbing up a mantel
destroying the wall as Webby futilely tries to pull him back
on the chain Nearby an apprehensive Genie watches the
nephews argue Huey tries to hand the lamp to Dewey who
refuses to take it

ELEPHANT
(under boy’s
dialogue)
Fearful trumpets

WEBBY
(under boy’s
dialogue)
Down girl Down Pleeese

HUEY
Here Louie you wish Pinky

LOUIE

wishes You do it

DEWEY
No way

GENIE
Well somebody do something

Huey grabs the lamp impatiently
HUEY
Here - -
(wishing)
I wish Webby never made her
stupid wish

The Genie does his magic hand wave and POOF no elephant
(also the damage to the library goes away)°

DELETE
Just then they hear

MRS BEAKLEY (0S)
In here Mr McDuck

The kids rush quickly out of the way one of the nephews
pulling Genie They dive behind a high-back divan
Meanwhile Mrs Beakley runs into the room with Scrooge
She looks around astonished

MRS BEAKLEY
gasp It’s gone

SCROOGE
Mrs Beakley is this a ploy
to get some vacation time

Mrs Beakley steps further into the room looking around
warily She peeks behind a wall tapestry

MRS BEAKLEY
It was here honest An
elephant wearing a big pink
bow You think I’m crazy
don’t you

Meanwhile the kids (with the Genie) rush out from behind
the divan and head out of the room Scrooge barely catches
Sight of them He takes toward the door

SCROOGE
Maybe not

He heads for the door Meanwhile

INT BOYS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The nephews and Webby come rushing in with the Genie (who is
regular size again) They slam the door behind them and
lean their backs against it

LOUIE
(breathless)
I think he saw us

Dewey holds up the lamp

DEWEY
Quick get back in the lamp

GENIE
Not the lamp Please Put

Huey motions to the closet
HUEY

No sooner does Genie scamper in the closet than Scrooge
KNOCKS on the door and enters Instantly the boys and
Webby are angelic

NEPHEWS WEBBY
Hello Uncle Scrooge

SCROOGE
Dunna hello me What kind

NEPHEWS WEBBY

INSIDE THE CLOSET

We see the Genie standing on a skateboard to see through the
keyhole (A yellow shirt and baseball cap hangs on the
door)

SCROOGE (0S)
Then what’s going on

NEPHEWS (0S)
Nothing Not much Not a

Just then the skateboard starts sliding from under the
Genie’s feet

BEDROOM
The boys are standing in front of the closet when we hear a
sudden CRASH from inside along with a

GENIE (0S)
Big cry

Scrooge looks toward the closet suspiciously as the boys’
eyes dart nervously toward the sound

SCROOGE
What was that

NEPHEWS
The crash in the closet We
didn’t hear it

Scrooge steps angrily between them and grabs the door
handle The boys cringe as he swings open the door
Suddenly out breezes Genie er Gene on the skateboard
He makes an uncontrolled U-turn and crashes into Scrooge
Gone is the Genie outfit Now he wears the yellow baseball
cap and the yellow shirt (which hangs past his knees) and
oversized high-top tennis shoes He looks like a junior
nephew

GENIE
Hey pops Gimme five Get

DISSOLVE TO

EXT SOMEWHERE IN THE REAR OF THE SCROOGE ESTATE - DUSK
The rear of the mansion is far in the distance as we PAN
OVER the tree tops to catch Dewey curving through the sky on
a hang-glider which gives off a slight trail of pixie-dust

AND BELOW

Webby is polishing a tea set on a kid-sized table (This is
the set she’1ll use later) As we PAN OVER to Louie
bouncing on a trampoline we see sports equipment and video
games strewn about the lawn Huey watches as he holds the
lamp Note there are toy train tracks at his feet

HUEY
What else should we wish for

LOUIE
How ‘bout a small speed boat

GENIE (VO)
Careful

Just then a toy train comes puttering by The Genie sits on
the engine

GENIE
It doesn’t come with a lake
you know Chuckle

Huey in pensive thought suddenly brightens

HUEY (PARTIALLY VO)
I know I wish for the
world’s biggest ice cream
sundae
(catching himself)
But not too big

The Genie jumps off the train and starts waving his hands
toward the sky

GENIE
(a la Price is
Right)
Ice cream sundae come on
gown Chuckle

WIDE - A bowl the size of a kid’s pool falls from the sky
and lands with a THUMP Giant scoops of ice cream quickly
fall into it piling higher than Huey - PLOP-PLOP-PLOP

Then a stream of sparkling butterscotch sauce pours over the
top while pixie-dust sprinkles down turning into candy
sprinkles

ON HUEY AND THE GENIE - looking up into the sky Huey is
astonished Just then WIND BLOWS as a giant cherry smacks
Huey in the face As cherry juice drips down the Genie
TAKES and licks a finger sticking it in the air

GENIE
Gotta watch out for that wind
sheer

The others RUSH IN from the side grabbing spoons already
stuck in the ice cream

WEBBY
I’m starvin’

Dewey looks the sunset which is about to disappear (Huey
is now eating the giant cherry which he holds like a piece
of watermelon)

DEWEY
That’s ‘cause it’s getting
late

HUEY

Bet you Uncle Scrooge’1ll
wonder why we missed dinner

LOUIE
Maybe we should go back

The boys think about this for a beat then shake their
heads

NEPHEWS
Naaaaahhh

And all continue eating the ice cream Genie included

KIDS AND GENIE
Slurpy eating sounds

The bottom half of the mansion is lit as we hear

MRS BEAKLEY (VO)
No sign of them yet

INT FOYER AREA
Scrooge paces as Mrs Beakley peeks out a curtained window
Duckworth stands on the sidelines

MRS BEAKLEY
Should I call the police

Scrooge waves his cane Boy is he mad

SCROOGE
Aye to hold me back when
those rascals finally get
home

As Scrooge paces past another window the kids sneak a peak
They react to what he says

SCROOGE
This time they’ll be grounded
for a month

CLOSER ON KIDS As Scrooge continues his harangue Dewey
who holds the lamp whispers something to Genie Genie
brightens and nods He then points his finger at Scrooge
A bit of pixie-dust shoots out

SCROOGE (VO CONT)
No video games No
television And no more
friends

ON SCROOGE who is struck on the side of the head by the
pixie dust which briefly sparkles around him

SCROOGE (CONT)

Suddenly the kids step through the front door acting as if
nothing is wrong Dewey hides the lamp under his shirt

NEPHEWS
We’re back

Mrs Beakley reacts sternly

MRS BEAKLEY
I think your Uncle has
something to say to you

Scrooge approaches with a scowl

SCROOGE
(threateningly)
Aye

The kids and Genie look a bit apprehensive when
unexpectedly Scrooge does an about face and extends his arms
to give them a group hug Beakley reacts

SCROOGE
(sweetly)
Welcome home Can I get you
and Gene anything Cookies
Milk Ice cream

Louie holds his stomach and makes a face

LOUIE
No thanks We’re kinda
full

WEBBY

And sleepy
SCROOGE
That’s because it’s past your
bed time Now scoot a long

Like a sweet nanny he shoos them off

Genie waves as he and the kids rush up the steps The kids
call out sweetly

NEPHEWS WEBBY

Goodnight Uncle Scrooge

Scrooge is waving back with a sweet smile Duckworth leans
toward Scrooge dryly saying

DUCKWORTH

As Scrooge suddenly looks puzzled at what just occurred
we

INT BOYS’ BEDROOM

The room is illuminated by the moon as the Nephews get
dressed in night shirts and caps getting ready for bed
The Genie is already in bed He puts his hands behind his
head

It’s all I’ve ever wished

for
DELETE
HUEY
How many wishes do we have
left

We see that Louie has the lamp

LOUIE
Just my last one And
Webby’s

As Louie continues the Genie notices something outside -
the flapping shadow of a bird with a big wing spread on the
pane It could be hawk heading straight for the mansion
The Genie sits up worriedly

LOUIE (CONT)
We better make sure they’re
real special

Just then the shadowy form a LARGE BIRD with glowing eyes
lands on a branch The Genie freaks

GENIE
It’s him

He jumps out of bed POOFING to tiny size

GENIE
Hide me Hide me

As Louie sits up Genie jumps under Lovie’s cap

GENIE
Hurry Wish him away

LOUIE
Who

Genie is outlined under the cap as he points toward the
closet

GENIE
Merlock He’s come to get
me

Huey looks out the window and for the first time we see
that it’s not a hawk but an OWL

HUEY
It’s just an owl

GENIE
An owl

As the Genie dares to stick his head out the owls HOOTS
and flutters away

DEWEY
He comes around here every
night

The Genie slides down Louie’s head to rest on his beak
GENIE
Big sigh I thought it was
my meanest master - the one
Collie Baba stole the lamp
from

Louie plucks him up from his beak and holds him in his hand

LOUIE
Your master was a bird
GENIE
A bird a snake a wolf -- he

could change into anything
He’s an evil sorcerer

The boys gather around

DEWEY
But he can’t still be alive

LOUIE
He’d be ancient

HUEY
Older than Uncle Scrooge

Genie shudders
GENIE

Yeah except his first wish
was to live forever

The nephews share looks

HUEY
Ooo good wisher
GENIE
No bad wisher You don’t

know

(gets choked up)
He made me do the worst
things

LOUIE
Like what

favorite resort until Merlock
couldn’t get reservations --
then down she went And poor
Pompeii Mt Vesuvius would

The Genie pulls out a handkerchief and BLOWS his nose

Dewey is counting on his fingers confused

The Genie hops
toward a small

But what are you worried
about He used up his

GENIE
That’s just it Merlock has
unlimited wishes because he

NEPHEWS
The taliswhat

onto a bureau and makes magical gestures
mirror The image of the talisman appears in
turns like a hologram on display

GENIE
Merlock’s talisman It’s
what gives him all his
powers

The image of the lamp appears in the mirror As the Genie
speaks the talisman slowly descends into it producing a
bright light that illuminates the boys’ faces

GENIE
And when he puts it in the
lamp he gets as many wishes
as he wants

The boys are taken aback

GENIE (CONT)
See why I’m a little jumpy
DEWEY
Maybe WE should wish for the
talisman

GENIE

That’s the one wish I can’t
do You’d have to steal it
from him yourself And good
luck

The picture fades from the mirror Louie picks up the Genie
and carries him over to his bunk

LOUIE
Well don’t worry about that
mean old master now

DEWEY
He has no idea you’re with
us

HUEY
And that’s the way it’s going
to stay

Louie places the Genie back in bed and tucks him in

EXT MANSION - FOLLOWING MORNING

The mansion glistens in the morning sun as as PAN OVER to
TWEETING bluebirds in the surrounding trees All of a
sudden a shadow falls over them They look up in alarm and
flutter away as we reveal a giant MerlockCondor flying in
toward the shrubbery of the main gates He holds a nervous
looking Dijon by the seat of his pants

DIJON

Terrified Scream

DIJON

Ow Ooch Ah Ouch

Merlock returns to human form and gazes at the mansion

MERLOCK
Are you certain this is his
domicile

Dijon rises and points to the McDuck sign over the gate

DIJON
(Pained snagged on thorns)
Ow Yes master Ouch

MERLOCK
Then we begin our search

DIJON
(frightened)
In daylight But I am not a
popular favorite in that house
Scrooge find me he kill me

Grabbing his talisman Merlock looks snidely at Dijon

MERLOCK
Then stay behind if you wish

Merlock clutches his talisman and begins to change He
shrinks down down down - finally transforming to a truly
nasty-looking rat

DIJON
Pained Yell

MERLOCKRAT
(raspier-voiced)
I’1l try very hard to remember

Dijon looks alarmed as the Merlockrat scampers under the gate
and across the lawn Dijon tries to follow attempting to
climb the gate

INT LIVING ROOM

Meanwhile Merlockrat peeks in through the letter arop in
front door He glances around and quietly slithers in No
sooner is he inside when he hears Scrooge’s voice and scurries
up the staircase
SCROOGE

Scrooge stomps through the room heading up the stairs with
Duckworth following behind holding a pressed tuxedo

BACK TO WEBBY’S ROOM

The tea party continues Webby’s dolls are propped up all
around her and Genie (Note The lamp is next to Webby)

WEBBY

First you pour the tea
(she pours)

Then take little sips
(teeny slurp)

And talk to your guests

(to Quacky)

Oh what a lovely dress

Quacky

The Genie looks at her as if she were the girl with two heads
GENIE
Get outta here No war paint
or tomahawks or anything
Webby motions to all her stuffed toys
WEBBY

No just you and me and my
friends here

GENIE
You call these party animals
They’re lifeless

Suddenly Webby brightens

WEBBY
Oh Genie you’ve just given me
the bestest idea in the world
(lifting the lamp)
There IS a way to have all my
friends enjoy the party

Genie reacts as he realizes the awful mistake he’s made

GENIE
gleep I didn’t mean it
The less the merrier Just you
and me and a pot of tea

Webby picks up the lamp and makes her wish

WEBBY
This will be fun
(hold up the lamp)
I wish all my toys and dollies
were alive

The Genie winces as he waves his hands all around

GENIE
(horrified)
gasp Shabooey

We see pixie-dust being cast on the dolls and stuffed
animals all over the room --

- plush puppies and bears on the bed

— oversized stuffed animals standing under the window
including a BIG BEAN BAG TIGER

The dolls and stuffed animals begin to animate blink their
eyes swivel their heads rise up unsteadily

Webby is wide-eyed in wonder The Genie looks nervous He
half hides behind Webby

WEBBY
It’s so nice to finally meet
all of you - especially you
Quacky

Genie timidly offers them a plate of cookies He’s getting
pawwed and sniffed

GENIE
Er uh cookies anyone

All the dolls dive for them in a mad rush

STUFFED ANIMALS
Voracious gobbling sounds

GENIE
Whoa Feeding frenzy

The dolls start throwing around the cups and saucers playfully

and BANGING them together Genie reacts while Webby wags a
finger

WEBBY
Dollies Be good

The dollies continue acting wild though a few playfully wag
fingers back at Webby

Just then the Genie notices something OS

GENIE
(gasp of alarm)

A bunch of the dolls are opening the bedroom door to get out
The Genie rushes over to try and close the door

GENIE
No no

HALLWAY
Several toys including the Tiger and a cute ducky-on-wheels
head into the hallway before Genie can act as a barrier

GENIE
Whimper Please don’t go
Well play Simon Says

Unfortunately a teddy bear doll comes barreling through
knocking over Genie and causing a stampede of other dolls to
follow SFX HAPPY DOLL BABBLE

GENIE
(Whoup)
Simon says Come back

Elsewhere in the hallway the Merlockrat is peeking around
the corner and dashes away as we PAN BACK to find Mrs Beakley
looking under a hallway table holding her broom up

MRS BEAKLEY
(nervously)
If there’s anything I hate more
than elephants in the house
it’s rats

Just then there’s the sound of approaching DOLLY BABBLE Mrs
Beakley looks up to see a bunch of plush toys heading her way
She reacts with a horrified TAKE

MRS BEAKLEY
Big gasp

and races away with the plush dolls on her heels

MRS BEAKLEY
AHHHH Maybe I do need that
vacation

The Genie and Webby rush in from behind and stop to react to
what has happened to poor Mrs Beakley

GENIE
Whimper Wish them back
pleeeze Before your Uncle
Scrooge sees this

WEBBY
I can’t That was my last wish

GENIE
I wish you hadn’t said that

ELSEWHERE IN THE HOUSE
The rat is now skulking around hallway on the lookout for

Genie and the lamp but with a watchful eye peeled for Mrs
Beakley

Just then Webby’s Tiger bounds up and sees the rat
The Merlockrat sees the toy Tiger and does a TAKE

The tiger reacts with a hungry SLURP as he steps menacingly
toward the rat

The rat steps back warily What the Meanwhile

SCROOGE’S STUDY

Scrooge is at his desk as Duckworth listens on the phone
DUCKWORTH
Oh dear Launchpad isn’t
answering He must be on his
way

At that moment the ducky-on-wheels rolls in looking toward
the two It accidentally bumps into the hat rack causing
Scrooge’s top hat to fall on it

DUCKWORTH
Won‘’t you go sir

Scrooge rises and heads for the door

SCROOGE
Aye To work Tell Launchpad
he can take you to the ball

As Scrooge reaches for his hat he realizes it’s not there He
looks down to see it at his feet When he bends to pick it
up it moves out of reach He does a TAKE and tries again
It moves the other direction He stands up looking perplexed

SCROOGE (CONT)
WAKI

SCROOGE (CONT)
Since when does a hat have a
mind of its own

SCROOGE (CONT)
Whistling

Scrooge looks away as if disinterested then twirls quickly
and throws himself on the hat

SCROOGE (CONT)
Gotcha

To his surprise the hat starts racing around the room
heading out the door carrying Scrooge Duckworth rushes
after

SCROOGE
Wahhhh

DUCKWORTH
Ahhhh

DUCKWORTH (CONT)
Hold onto your hat sir

HALLWAY

The Genie and Webby are each struggling with an armful of
squirming toys when Scrooge rushes past being dragged by the
hat Webby and Genie leap out of the way

SCROOGE
Look out

Webby and Genie gawk at the sight as Duckworth rushes after

GENIE
(scared)
Why do I have the feeling
that’s our fault too

«AND DOWN IN THE FOYER
Dijon suddenly peeks his head into a window He looks around
furtively then opens the window calling every so faintly

DIJON
(Whisper)
Master

Just then a BOUNCING PONY (a ball that you sit on with a horse
head and handles sticking out the side of the head) BOUNCES
past with a BOINK-BOINK startling Dijon

DIJON
Huhl

He lets go of the window which SMASHES down on his nose

DIJON
(muffled)
YEOCH

He pulls his head back and his nose SNAPS back As he grabs
his nose in pain he looks up to see

DIJON (CONT)
grunt

TOP OF GRAND STAIRCASE

The top hat comes to the edge of the stairway and stops
abruptly Inertia sends Scrooge tumbling down the steps
taking the hat with him The freed ducky-on-wheels rolis
away

SCROOGE
Oof Ow Ooo Ahh

Scrooge finally tumbles to the bottom of the staircase and
lands with a belly-flop

SCROOGE
Umphh

When he lifts his dizzy head he sees that the room is in
complete pandemonium PLUSH CATS DOGS LIONS and FROGS are
chasing each other TEDDY BEARS are swinging on the
chandelier and climbing everywhere including the mantel
where they knock over bric-a-brac A JACKIN-THE-BOX goes
springing by FAIRY DOLLS fly around Scrooge’s head like
Tinkerbell tapping his head with their wands

FAIRY DOLL

ON DIJON rubbing his nose behind the window as he also gawks
oS at the sight

In the middle of all is a smiling life-sized TALKING DOLL who
keeps pulling her string and saying mundane things with the
calmness of the insane

TALKING DOLL

(singy-songy)
Hello How are you

(pulls string)
Aren’t we having fun

(pulls string)
Have you bought all my
accessories yet

SCROOGE
What is going on

As Scrooge looks at her in amazement the Merlockrat comes
zipping downstairs chased by the toy tiger which bounces
over Scrooge and atop his head smashing Scrooge’s face to the
floor

SCROOGE
Ouch

Merlockrat has rushed behind a chair to look back in
confusion just as the bouncing pony comes BOUNDING through
SMASHING him in the process The rat is thoroughly blitzed
At that point the Tiger skids in GOBBLING him up in one gulp
and sucking in the tail like a string of spaghetti - SLURP

Webby and Genie rush to the top of the stairs Webby now has

they rush down to the foyer

As the entire living room becomes still Scrooge looks about
in absolute astonishment as does Duckworth Mrs Beakley
ventures to stick her head from a closet where she’s been
hiding

SCROOGE
Blow me bagpipes

He looks at the Genie and points in amazement

SCROOGE
He’s a genie

Mrs Beakley stands behind Duckworth’s shoulder as they both
gawk at the Genie in astonishment

MRS BEAKLEY
Does his mother know about
this

Duckworth shoots Mrs Beakley a quickly withering glance as
Louie turns to Scrooge

LOUIE
We were going to tell you
Uncle Scrooge

DEWEY
-Ssomeday

SCROOGE
Where’d he come from

Webby points to the tea pot in Louie’s hand

WEBBY
Remember my tea pot --

Scrooge grabs the lamp from Louie and holds it to his bosom as
if it were the silver chalice

SCROOGE
Heavenly heather The Genie in
the magic lamp The fortunes I
could own

Scrooge begins to think as he paces

EXT ON DIJON

Still peeking in with great interest All at once the sound
of a HELICOPTER can be heard as the wind blows Dijon ducks
in the bushes holding onto his turban

Launchpad’s helicopter comes zooming in over the mansion It
makes a bouncy SKIDDING landing on the lawn After Launchpad
jerks to a stop he looks toward the mansion and BEEPS his
horn which sounds exactly like a car’s

AND IN THE LIVING ROOM
Duckworth announces to Scrooge

DUCKWORTH
It’s your ride sir Or
should I say my ride

Suddenly Scrooge brightens

SCROOGE
Are you kidding I wouldna
miss this party for all the
scones in Scotland

Duckworth looks particularly confused

DUCKWORTH
But the treasure

SCROOGE
Aye the treasure
(looking at Genie)
It’s the one wish I donna have
to think about twice

Just at that moment the Merlockrat appears to come to inside
the Tiger He appears to lift his head and look around

Scrooge holds the lamp reverently and makes his wish

SCROOGE
I wish for the treasure of
Collie Baba

GENIE
whimper I knew it

The Genie makes his hand move in the direction of the Tiger

At that moment the Merlockrat still dazed peeks out the
Tiger’s mouth He suddenly TAKES at the sight of the Genie

MERLOCKRAT
Gasp

A shimmer in the form of the treasure appears over the rat
who barely has time to react as he looks overhead When the
treasure appears in a POOF it’s suspended a foot or so in the
air for a beat before it falls with a CRASH right on hin

ON Dijon who winces

SCROOGE (VO)

Scrooge picks up a giant emerald gleeful

SCROOGE (CONT)
The bonnie bounty is mine

Once again they hear Launchpad’s BEEP BEEP

SCROOGE
Wait ‘til those old fossils at
the Society hear this news

Scrooge tosses the emerald back onto the pile and steps over
to Genie

SCROOGE
In the lamp Genie You’re
coming with me

The Genie and kids react
GENIE

No not the lamp Have a
heart

LOUIE

Scrooge

WEBBY NEPHEWS

care of him C’mon

SCROOGE
Oh no I’m not letting this
wee gold mine out of me sight

DEWEY

SCROOGE
Nonsense A genie isn’t a
person A genie is a a

The Genie looks completely affronted A knife in the back

NEPHEWS WEBBY
Awww No How can you say
that That’s mean

Scrooge is losing patience He points to the lamp sternly

SCROOGE
Inside

The Genie looks sadly over at the kids

GENIE
Bye guys It was great while
it lasted

His wave good-bye turns into a magical wave that sends him
shooting back into the lamp

Scrooge stuffs the lamp in his pocket and grabs his hat from
the floor He heads out the door as the kids follow in
protest

NEPHEWS WEBBY
Don’t take him Uncle Scrooge
please You can’t Let him
stay

Duckworth and Mrs Beakley follow too Dijon watches sees
his chance to go inside and slides open the window
ON THE TREASURE as Dijon steps up to it looking sad He
takes off his turban and holds it to his heart as he sighs

DIJON
poor master
(suddenly brightly)
Oh well

Ogling the riches he gleefully starts stuffing the jewels into
his turban As he does however the mound of treasure begins
to shake and RUMBLE Dijon only has a moment to cringe
before the treasure seems to EXPLODE The impact sends Dijon
flying

DIJON
Terrified Scream

There in the dust and scattered riches stands a surlylooking
Merlock holding his talisman He looks around

MERLOCK
Where’s the lamp

Dijon as we now see is hanging by his collar on a hat rack
He points toward a window

DIJON
Scrooge has it

Merlock comes up to the window just in time to see the
helicopter taking off with Scrooge inside He turns to his
cowering assistant

MERLOCK

You let him get away
DIJON

i was so worried about you

master

With a look to kill Merlock angrily snatches him off the
hook

DIJON (CONT)

EXT OVER TREETOPS

The helicopter swoops skyward heading toward the horizon A
couple of beats later the Merlockcondor SWOOps upward

feet above

It’s a magnificent building amidst the mountain peaks
glistening with snow Launchpad’s helicopter is parked next
to a filled parking lot Launchpad is wiping the windows

INT PARTY

It’s being held in a large festively decorated banquet hall
with an area for dancing PAN across a aistinguished-looking
international crowd CROWD SFX Even before we catch
Scrooge on the sidelines we hear

GENIE (VO)
(swooning)
Oh a party a real party I
haven’t been to one since
Nero’s barbecue You just
gotta let me out

Scrooge scowls at his pocket

SCROOGE
Forget it

GENIE (VO)
I’ll stay small like a fly on
the wall

SCROOGE
You bug me as it is

Just then several snide fellows including a monoclea pig-nose
-(SNOUTLY) and dog-nose wearing military medals (BONE) step
toward Scrooge CROWD SFX

COL SNOUTLY
So McDuck how goes the
treasure hunt

MAJOR BONE

Scrooge scowls silently when suddenly
GENIE (VO)

Nice guys

Scrooge quickly raps his cane against his pocket hitting the
lamp underneath CLANG

GENIE (VO)
Hey

Snoutly and Bone turn to Scrooge saying

COL SNOUTLY

GENIE (VO)

SCROOGE
Nothing —

GENIE (VO)

BONE

Are you talking to me

SCROOGE
Yes uh no I mean Excuse

And Scrooge angrily steps away as the others watch in a snooty
manner

COL SNOUTLY
I always said he was an odd
duck

When Scrooge gets to the side of the room he pulls out the
lamp and speaks to it

SCROOGE
Canna you keep quiet at all

GENIE (VO)
Can’t you let me out No one
will notice I come pocket-
sized

Scrooge rolls his eyes in utter frustration

SCROOGE
Oh all right all right

Immediately the Genie ZIPS out in a small ball of light ana
lands in Scrooge’s coat pocket He peeks out excitedly

GENIE
Hey look at us -- a couple of
single guys out on the town

Scrooge picks him out of the pocket

SCROOGE
Guess again

GENIE
Hey

Scrooge walks up to a tall potted bush and sticks the Genie
inside

SCROOGE
You can watch the ball from
here Otherwise you go back in
the lamp

As he heads away the Genie calls plaintively

GENIE
But what if I win the door
prize

EXT LODGE
At that moment Merlockcondor still carrying Dijon swoops
down from the heavens
DIJON
Fearful whimpers

The Merlockcondor drops him into a snow pile head first and
then transforms himself into normal form

DIJON (CONT)
(falling into snow)
Wahhh

Merlock looks toward the lodge as a dazed Dijon rises
knocking snow out of his ears

DIJON
Whoa master all this flip-
flapping Maybe we take the
bus back

MERLOCK
Silence You shall go through
the rear entrance while I go
in the front If Scrooge gets
past you it will be your hide

With a wincing look Dijon heads os

BACK INSIDE
A WAITRESS stands in front of the bush holding a tray of

drinks over her shoulder She is handing someone a soda with
a straw

WAITRESS
Here’s your soda sir

Suddenly Genie’s hands reach out and grab an identical soda on
her tray WHISK

INSIDE THE BUSH the Genie has a bowl of nuts a bowl of
potato chips a small plate of appetizers etc He balances
the (for him) oversized soda on a limb as he sips

GENIE
(self-satisfied)
SLURP Genie - party of one

He grabs a peanut and tosses it into the air His mouth opens
superwide to catch it For a second his face Swells with the
peanut Then he swallows looking pleased as punch

GENIE
Big Gulp

He picks up another peanut

AND OUTSIDE THE BUSH we watch as peanuts shoot up from the
top of the bush and come down With each peanut we hear

GENIE
Gulp Gulp Gulp

Suddenly the front door opens revealing Merlock in the
shadows A chilly breeze blows in blowing the leaves on the
plant Genie shivering from the chill peeks out

Merlock steps in from the shadows and quietly heads for the
crowds scanning the roon

The Genie clamps his hands over his beak as he TAKES big

GENIE
Muffled shriek

As Merlock passes by the bush it starts to shake like a
trembling person RUSTLING SFX

Merlock heads into the crowds looking searching

The Genie watches peering between leaves

GENIE
(to himself)
Whimper I got to find Mr

McDuck

He jumps behind the plant and POOFS into normal size Off he
goes Meanwhile

IN THE BACK KITCHEN

We watch as a BUSBOY sets down a tray of dirty dishes and then
heads OS Dijon peers through the window and watches him go
Seeing no one else Dijon stealthily enters the kitchen
through a back door As he heads through the room he sees
several items of silver on a shelf (pitcher salt and pepper
shakers) and stops He looks around furtively and then
pockets them almost faster than the eye can see

Next he is about to pass a display of silverware when he
stops and again looks around Seeing no one he starts
pocketing the forks knives and spoons by the handful
Meanwhile

INSIDE THE BANQUET ROOM

The Genie is carefully moving through the crowd and between
people’s legs calling out

GENIE
(urgent whisper)
Paging Mr McDuck Paging Mr
McDuck Whimper Where are
you

At one point the Genie walks right next to Merlock who is
looking around fingering his talisman The Genie spots him a
split second before the sorcerer looks in his direction The
Genie quickly ZIPS back and out of sight

GENIE
Paging Mr -- Whoup

Merlock does a slight TAKE not certain what he saw Just
then he hears

cracks a nasty smile

With a look of determination Merlock starts squeezing between
people heading for Scrooge The Genie sees him and starts
rushing toward the podium himself

SCROOGE

Just then the Genie races in and grabs Scrooge by the arm and
pulls him away

SCROOGE
AWK

Merlock just reaches the front of the crowd as Scrooge moves
out of sight Merlock looks around People look confused

CROWD
Curious Wallas

The Genie stops to look all around Scrooge gets his bearing

He’s mad as heck

SCROOGE
You What are you doing

GENIE
Having a breakdown

Suddenly he spots Merlock in the crowd He pulls him over
behind people and points

GENIE
(pointing)
It’s Merlock my old master

Scrooge looks up to catch Merlock looking through the crowds
again

Scrooge rolls up his sleeves ready for a fight
SCROOGE
It’s that back-stabbing
banshee
The Genie is catatonic He grabs Scrooge’s arm
GENIE
No He’s too powerful He can
destroy you
And he pulls Scrooge again

SCROOGE
Awk

As the Genie pulis him through a crowd
CROWD

Ad lib shouts and grunts
Hey What the Watch it

Just as they are heading for a rear exit Dijon appears at the
open door He sees them and grabs the sides of the door
trying to hold the fort He jars loose a silver tray that
falls with a CLATTER from under the back of his vest

DIJON
Merlock Merlock
Whistles

Merlock looks toward Dijon’s voice in confusion He spots our
heroes He heads for them

The Genie sees this and yanks Scrooge away

SCROOGE
Awk

Meanwhile Merlock heads for them throwing people out of the
way

CROWD

INSIDE A STATRWELL
The Genie pulls Scrooge up the steps running so fast he
practically drags Scrooge

This way

SCROOGE
Ad lib grunts

UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY
The Genie pulis him down a hallway

BACK AT THE STAIRS
Merlock rushing upstairs

BACK AT THE HALLWAY
Genie pulling Scrooge into a room DOOR SLAM

INSIDE THE HOTEL ROOM - Genie lets go of Scrooge at the door
and rushes OS

GENIE
Hurry

Scrooge looks at him in utter disgust

SCROOGE
You ARE a loon

Scrooge goes to open the door He opens it a crack and
suddenly the Genie pushes a bureau against the door SLAMMING
IT SHUT Scrooge TAKES with surprise

SCROOGE
Wak

BACK IN THE HALLWAY
On Merlock at an intersection in the hallway The sound of
the door slam grabs his attention He turns his head

BACK INSIDE THE ROOM
Scrooge looks dumbfounded as the Genie strains with all his
might to push a pile of furniture against the door

GENIE
STRAINED GRUNT

SCROOGE
What are you doing

He then quickly rushes up to Scrooge pulls out the lamp from
Scrooge’s inside pocket and thrusts it into Scrooge’s hands

GENIE
(out of breath)
Quick You gotta wish us out
of here

SCROOGE
Not me These wishes are worth
a fortune

GENIE
What’s more important - a
fortune or your life

Scrooge rubs his chin thoughtfully as he ponders the question

SCROOGE
Well

The Genie can’t believe it

GENIE
(sarcastic angry)
Hey It’s not exactly a trick
question

OUTSIDE THE DOOR
Merlock has come up to the door and grabbed the knob He
starts rattling it

INSIDE THE ROOM

Scrooge and Genie look toward the rattling in alarm as it gets
so bad the barricade start rattling Then - BAM - a bear’s
claw shoots through the door and barricade Scrooge is
aghast

SCROOGE
Bust me bagpipes

The Genie turns to Scrooge begging on bended knee

GENTE
(pleading)
One little getaway wish Just
one

As the barricade begins to break apart Scrooge brandishes his
cane with a look of determination

SCROOGE
No We stand our ground

The Genie grabs the lamp

GENIE
Well I’ve got one trick that
might help us - I hope

And he tosses the lamp into a ceiling light fixture Scrooge
barely has time to react as the Genie grabs his hand and holds
it up saying

GENIE
Going up

And with a wave of his hand they ZIP upwards turning into
two balis of light that enter the lamp’s spout

A split second later Merlock looking like a bearish beast
CRASHES through throwing off wood and debris

MERLOCKBEAR
Aargh

MERLOCK BEAR
wild bear growls

He steps through the room tossing back furniture Obviously
the room is empty

Suddenly he sees the curtains blowing at the window He
looks toward it returning to normal form A beat later
something else catches his attention - a CACHINKA-CAHINKA
noise like the sound of silverware clanging together
Suddenly Dijon steps in looking about His pockets are again
bulging He looks a bit nervous

DIJON

Uh oh Looks like they have
skipped the coop It was not
my fault Master They did not
get past Dijon

(suddenly catching

himself)
B-But it’s not your fault
either Oh no no no no
no

When Merlock turns to address Dijon he’s in his normal forn

MERLOCK
(snappish)
Just keep looking around while
I hunt them outside

He clutches his talisman turns into a hawk and flies outside

DIJON
Of course As you wish
master I do for you

But as he is about to leave an ashtray catches his eye He
snatches it up and pockets it

After Dijon has left we move to the lamp We hear

GENIE (VO)
(filtered)
I don’t hear anything I think
they’re gone

SCROOGE (VO)
(filtered)
Where are we

GENIE (VO)
(gingerly)
Well it’s not exactly the
Ritz-Carlton

SCROOGE (VO)
Not the lamp
GENIE (VO)
Yeah sorry about the smell
but you get used to it after a
hundred years Could you move
your elbow

Scrooge yells so loud the lamp shakes

SCROOGE (VO)
Get me out of here

Suddenly two lights shoot out of the lamp and in a POOFY
BURST Scrooge and the Genie appear with the Genie massaging
a sore ear

GENIE
Do you have to yell at me all
the time

Scrooge looks up at the lamp still in the fixture He uses
his cane to slide it out

SCROOGE
Hmph I wouldna be in this
mess if it weren’t for you

GENIE
That’s it blame the Genie I
only saved your life

As Scrooge grabs the lamp off the cane he looks a bit
chagrined

SCROOGE
(begrudgingly)
Sorry

As the Genie speaks he gazes out the window trying to spot
Merlock

GENIE

It’s not my fault Merlock’s
after me I didn’t ask to be
Mr Popular

(getting tearful)
All I want is a life of my own
-- like your nephews

(getting dreamy)
With my own bike A stack of
comic books A sled

(thinks as Scrooge
sympathizes then
continues)
Maybe some ski equipment A C-
D player My own home video
entertainment system

SCROOGE
(overlapping)
All right all right

Just then the hawk goes by in the distance The Genie jumps
into Scrooge’s arms

GENIE
Whoup There he is

As Scrooge peers out the window

SCROOGE
I’ve got to get you to my
vault It’s the only safe
place
(pointing at the
lamp)
Time to go back

GENIE
(upset)
But you saw what a dump it is
SCROOGE
Sorry Genie but the party’s

over
The Genie shrugs his shoulders in despair

GENIE
And just when we were getting
to be buddies

The Genie waves turns into an orb of light and pops into the
lamp

HALLWAY

Scrooge peers out the hole in the broken door looking right
and left down the corridor

He sneaks up to intersecting corridors Just around the
corner is a dinner cart situated outside one of the lodge
hotel room doors On the cart is a gravy boat It is
situated in the extreme foreground so that it’s huge and we
can immediately see that it bears a striking resemblance to
our lamp

Just then Dijon steathily backs out of a room with a bundle
of towels under his arm Despite his careful footsteps the

silver in his pockets still CLANK causing Scrooge to turn

They see each other

DIJON
Scrooge

Scrooge heads around the corner and tumbles over the cart
dropping the lamp

SCROOGE
Wak
(hitting the ground)
Umph

As Scrooge rises he suddenly realizes that he doesn’t have
the lamp He sees a gravy bowl and mistakenly grabs it As
he races away Dijon who is weighted down by his booty comes
CLANGING around the corner and trips over the spilled cart
falling flat on his face Silverware and other items go
flying from his person

DIJON
Oomph

Meanwhile Scrooge heads out an exit at the end of the
corridor

Dijon rises in alarm He looks back and forth from the
exiting Scrooge to all the stuff he has lost He starts
repocketing it as quickly as he can including the lamp

DIJON
Whimper

Just then he hears

GENIE (VO)
Mr McDuck Mr McDuck

Dijon looks around for a beat Where’s this voice coming
from

GENIE (VO)
Are you all right

He realizes it’s coming from his pocket He pulis out the
lamp

GENIE (VO)
What’s going on
Dijon’s eyes pop open in delight

DIJON
Big excited giggle

He starts rubbing the lamp

DIJON
Come out come out whoever you
are

Just then the ball of light pops out and the Genie appears
in a burst He sees Dijon and reacts

GENIE
Gasp

DIJON
Wait till Merlock sees this
He will be so grateful
(looking off dreamy-
eyed)
I can see my mountain of money
now

Dijon rushes to a hallway window and opens it to call Merlock

DIJON (CONT)
ELATED LAUGHTER

GENIE
Wait Wait Why give him the
lamp

DIJON
Because the master wants it so
badly

GENIE

But with the lamp you’ll be
the big cheese the hot
falafel

(bowing)
The most powerful person on
earth O great Master

Dijon is taken aback His eyes widen with a far away look

DIJON
Master Master

REVERSE ON DIJON FROM OUTSIDE WINDOW
As the Genie slowly closes the frosty window drawing a
curtain on Dijon

DIJON
Master Dijon Oooh I

like it
Meanwhile

EXT AT HELICOPTER (CONTINUOUS)
Launchpad is wiping the copter windows when he hears

SCROOGE (0S)
Launchpad

Scrooge is racing for the copter

SCROOGE (CONT)
Get me outta here fast

Meanwhile the hawk is soaring around the lodge when it hears
the blades

He sees Scrooge racing into the passenger’s seat in the
distance

Before our eyes the hawk swoops down three feet over the
ground and turns into a charging MOUNTAIN LION SFX ANGRY
SCREECH

As Scrooge pulls the door shut behind him Launchpad
remarks

LAUNCHPAD
Dull party eh Mr McDee

Just then he sees the lion heading his way Scrooge pushes
on one of the control levers

SCROOGE
Go now

VAROOM - the blades go into overdrive throwing up so much
wind that the snow on the ground is blown away and the lion is
hit with a sudden blizzard that has him recoiling FELINE
SCREECH

The snow is blown so quickly that he’s covered in seconds

And the helicopter zooms up chaotically The tail finally
straightens and off it goes

The Merlockmountain lion shakes off the snow from his head
and looks up in alarm He charges after the helicopter which
swoops away from the lodge

The mountain lion heads over some rocks making a gigantic
leap AWAY FROM CAMERA over a gorge and toward the copter He
arcs over the edge falling OS only to re-appear again in the
wide-winged form of a giant CONDOR swooping up into the sky
SFX LION ROAR CROSS-FADING INTO A PIERCING SCREECH

As the distant helicopter heads into the clouds again the
condor follows in pursuit pumping its powerful wings

WIPE TO

EXT BIN MORNING

The sun peeks over the horizon as the helicopter swoops in to
land on the roof The building is shadowed so that you can’t
make out the S insignia Scrooge doesn’t wait for Launchpad
to land He hops out holding the gravy boat

SCROOGE
Donna bother landing I donna

disasters

And he races into a door leading to

Scrooge races down a flight of stairs and heads into --

AHALLWAY

Which he rushes down He BURSTS through double doors leading
into --

SCROOGE’S OFFICE

He suddenly stops in his tracks TAKING BIG at the sight
before him

SCROOGE
AWK

What he sees is Dijon sitting at his desk his feet propped
up The Genie sits on the desk looking like he’d rather be
anywhere else

DIJON
Good morning Scrooge sir

SCROOGE
What’s going on

DIJON
At the urging of my Genie I
have decided to seek my
fortune

GENIE
I never thought he’d wish for
your fortune Mr McDuck I
swear

A bewildered Scrooge pulls out his gravy boat

SCROOGE
B-but the lamp --

He suddenly smells something and sniffs at the boat

SCROOGE
Sniffing Gravy

Dijon sits up showing the real lamp
DIJON
That’s right I get the loot
You get the boot
He pushes a security buzzer on the desk BUZZ
EXT BIN ENTRANCE

And a beat later Scrooge is being dragged out by four dog-and-
Guck-faced SECURITY GUARDS He rants and raves

SCROOGE
No You canna do this Put me
down

In the cloudy sky the silhouette of the condor crosses over
the heavens Merlock looks down in puzzlement as he hears

SCROOGE (OS CONT)
I’m your boss

The guards bring Scrooge up to an open paddy wagon

SCROOGE
Not that bum

They toss him inside THUMP

SCROOGE
Whoup

A dog-nosed OFFICER standing on the side SLAMS the doors shut
Scrooge immediately picks himself up and starts railing
through the bars of the rear window as the guards walk away

2 SCROOGE
Well you can forget about this
year’s Christmas bonus Whose
name do you think is on this
building

As he speaks he looks up and starts to catch himself For
instead of the giant S insignia on the front facade there’s a
giant D THUNDER RUMBLES in the heavens

Scrooge is aghast as the paddy wagon REVS up its motor

SCROOGE
GASP It really is his

THUNDER is heard as the wagon takes Scrooge away So does the
Merlock-condor who watches perched on a U-Turn sign as he
looks back and forth between the wagon and the building A
crack of lightning streaks through the sky as THUNDER
continues and we --

Scrooge looks heavenward

SCROOGE
If I ever get me money back I

He hangs his head looking helpless when he hears KEYS

his cell

POLICEMAN
There’s someone to see you Mr

INT LOBBY AREA CONTINUOUS

The Nephews Webby Launchpad Mrs Beakley and Duckworth
stand together - a depressed looking group Mrs Beakley is
sniffing into her handkerchief As Scrooge is being escorted

Uncle Scrooge

The boys and Webby rush into his arms as the others gather

Just then Mrs Beakley rushes up and gives him a smothering
blubbering squeeze

MRS BEAKLEY

Oh Mr McDuck I’m so sorry

Suddenly Scrooge is the one doing the comforting as she sobs
in his arms He pats her on her back

SCROOGE

Webby holds up a piggy bank

Scrooge sits down He’s shaken too

SCROOGE

Louie looks out a window The rain has stopped though it
still looks gloomy The bin is in the distance

LOUIE
At least we have each other
Think of poor Genie

DEWEY
If only there was a way to
sneak in and get back the lamp

HUEY
There are so many alarms

Scrooge looks downcast

SCROOGE
Aye hundreds And fourteen-
thousand six-hundred fifty-
seven ways to trigger them

Suddenly the boys begin to brighten

DEWEY

And you know each and every
one don’t you Uncle Scrooge

SCROOGE

LOUIE
And maybe a way to shut them
off

SCROOGE

Scrooge looks around conspiratorially

INT SCROOGE’S OFFICE - THAT NIGHT

The place has been turned into a room fit for a king Big
pillows draped curtains and trays and trays of food
everywhere you look Dijon is lifting lids to smell the
aroma

DIJON
Deep sniff Delicious
(another lid)
Deep sniff Delicious Good
golly everything smells more
delicious when you’re rich

He amusedly lifts his vest and sniffs underneath

DIJON (CONT)
Sniff-sniff Even Dijon

Meanwhile the Genie peeks through the window warily

GENIE
Shouldn’t we be bird watching

Dijon lifts the lid on a tureen of bouillabaisse and ladelis it
into a bowl

DIJON
Don’t worry about Merlock He
would not dare to confront the
Great and Powerful Dijon

ON ANOTHER WINDOW - As Dijon walks past with his bowl of soup
we see a hawk looking in upside down from the top of the
window Hold on the window

DIJON (CONT)
Anyways I don’t think he knows

The hawk flies down to another window sill somewhere in the
back of the bin With an evil expression he begins to
transform shrinking into a winged cockroach He noses at
cracks between the window and the sill trying to find a spot
to squeeze through

Meanwhile high IN THE SKY a plane approaches in the
distance

INSIDE THE PLANE

Launchpad is at the controls He calls back to Scrooge
standing in the body of the plane Duckworth is strapping a
parachute on hin

The Nephews Webby and Mrs Beakley are on the ground hiding
behind bushes near the bin Mrs Beakley is looking around
with opera glasses The Nephews are wearing black commando
outfits with rope and gear On their heads are army helmets
adorned with leaves for added camouflage

HUEY

DEWEY

You see anyone coming
Commander Beakley

MRS BEAKLEY
(tremulous)
I don’t think so

LOUIE
Then wish us luck

And the kids sneak off for the bin Mrs Beakley watches them
in apprehension

ABOVE (CONTINUOUS)

Scrooge jumps out of the plane and free falls for a beat or
two Then he pulls his draw string and a square parachute
poofs out By pulling on handles connected to the chute he
is able to direct his descent straight toward the roof

He lands on the run Meanwhile
BACK AT THE WINDOW

The Merlockcockroach is having a tough time trying to squeeze
under the window He has half his body stuck in when he
decides to pull out His antennae are mashed He shakes his
head to SPRING them back out Suddenly he hears footsteps
and looks down

MERLOCK POV showing the kids sneaking up to the back door
of the bin around fifty feet under Merlock’s window

The Merlockcockroach bends over as he watches until he’s
upside down

While Webby and the other Nephews look around furtively Dewey
jumps up to punch out the secret code on the wall panel which
is a little high for him He jumps on each letter

DEWEY
C-A-S -H

There’s a brief muted BUZZ accompanied by a green light
The door has been unlocked Huey opens it

HUEY
Hurry

And the kids rush in

The Merlockcockroach sees this and quickly flies down as
speedily as he can

INT BIN HALLWAY (CONTINUOUS)
The cockroach ZIPS in a split second before the door CLICKS
shut

Meanwhile the kids oblivious to Merlock’s presence behind
them survey the dark surroundings The floor is a
checkerboard of black and white tiles

HUEY
Remember only step on the
white tiles

And they take off in a line hop-scotching down the corridor
The Merlockcockroach hovers above and behind looking smugly
at the kids as they head away He heads off in another
direction

We follow him as he BUZZES around a corner As he does he
breaks an electric eye bean

Suddenly a stop sign SPRINGS up from the floor blocking him
Then all manner of weaponry - crossbows cannons and ouzies
plus mechanical arms holding sabers bats flyswatters a live
skunk etc - SWIVEL out from the wall and are directed
toward the malevolent bug

The cockroach reacts in horror

MERLOCK COCKROACH
Buzzy shriek

He ZIPS back around the corner so quickly he’s a blur He
again breaks through the electric eye

All the weaponry SWIVELS back

The Merlockcockroach looks back from around the corner He
then looks in the direction the kids went He decides to head
after them and off he goes Meanwhile

Scrooge is taking off his parachute which he stuffs into a
drum As he looks around he speaks into his walkie-talkie

SCROOGE

And we’re inside

SCROOGE
Good Now all you have to do

is --

INT GROUND FLOOR (CONTINUOUS)

The Nephews are standing on each other’s shoulders boosting
Webby into an open vent (The grating is hinged on top)
Louie is on top of the totem pole Dewey is at the botton
speaking into the walkie-talkie

SCROOGE (VO)
-- break into the security

room

DEWEY
Don’t worry We’re almost
there

INSIDE THE VENT
Webby crawls through the dark vent looking apprehensive Not
only is it a tight squeeze but there’s spider webs too

WEBBY
(scared echo)
Easy for you to say

ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE VENT as Louie cranes his neck to peer
in While he speaks the Merlockcockroach lands among the
leaves on his camouflaged helmet He also gazes down the
vent

LOUIE
Keep goin’ Webby If you
can’t fit through no one can

BACK WITH THE Boys

As they step to the door leading to the security room they
look worried

DEWEY
She’s just gotta unlock this
door

Just then the boys hear the SWITCH OF A LOCK and suddenly
Webby opens the door from the inside and extends her arm
posing like a trapeze artist

WEBBY
Ta-da

LOUIE
Atta girl

The boys rush into the room
INSIDE THE SECURITY ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

The kids rush up to an area where their faces are illuminating
by lights blinking OS accompanied by MUTED BUZZ SFX

DEWEY
There’s the alarm panel

The kids are facing a panel set back between two walls A
laser beam shoots intermittently on and off at all angles
between the walls blocking any one from reaching the panel
The beam is unpredictable and gives off the muted BUZZ as it
shoots

The Merlockcockroach gawks at the sight from Louie’s helmet
Meanwhile Louie pulls out a sheet of paper
LOUIE
I’ve got Uncle Scrooge’s

directions to keep from gettin’
zapped

He stands in the middle of the threshold to the laser
corridor The others watch

LOUIE
(reading)
Two steps up the middle

He takes two steps Lasers BUZZ around him The cockroach
peeks out fearfully He can’t believe this is happening

LOUIE
One step to the right

Louie takes a step to the right

LOUIE
Three steps forward

He takes the steps When he stops he holds up the paper
toward the lights on the wall trying to read it

LOUIE
And

(holds it out)
five steps

Just then a beam strikes the paper instantly burning a hold
through it Louie pulls back his hand and freezes

LOUIE
Wak -- Uh oh --

The cockroach’s eyes bug out in shock
The others call out to Louie

DEWEY
You better get back here

As Louie makes a run for it he is abruptly stopped by a
laser Another step another laser He soon finds himself
contorting into back-breaking shapes as the laser shoots at
weird angles It’s like being caught in a magician’s box with
lasers shooting through every which way The cockroach holds
onto the helmet for dear life

LOUIE
(ad lib shrieks)
Whoup Woo Hee Ha Hoo
(etc )

One laser ZINGS the top of his helmet sending the cockroach
flying
LOUIEMERLOCK-COCKROACH
Yeow PAINED BUZZ

He finally jumps out of the corridor The others catch him
Huey notes the smoldering section of his helmet

HUEY
Good thing you had this on

We see the cockroach staggering out of the laser corridor near
the wall completely blackened and smoldering

MERLOCKCOCKROACH
Dazed groan

Back on the kids as Webby looks down the laser corridor

WEBBY
Now what are we going to do

Huey turns to his brothers

HUEY
(to others)
Marbles

DEWEYLOUIE
(nodding)
Marbles

And the next thing you know the boys pull out slingshots

Once again marbles go flying this time shot past the lasers
When they hit the circuitry panel it short-circuits ina
chain reaction of SIZZLES and POPS that spreads in seconds
All the lights on the panel blink out The laser also stops

The sound startles the cockroach who seems to come back to his
senses as he looks at the sight of the SIZZLING PANEL

Dewey smiles lifting the walkie-talkie

DEWEY
I don’t think you have to worry
about any alarms Uncle
Scrooge

SCROOGE (VO)

Good work lads I’m going in

As the cockroach is listening to the above he cracks a nasty
grin He flutters his wings causing most of the ash covering
him to fall away He ZIPS AWAY into the air Meanwhile

ON THE ROOF (CONTINUOUS)

Scrooge uses his cane to force the lock on a door

INT ELEVATOR ROOM (CONTINUOUS

It contains the motors and top of the pulley system for the
elevators The pulley spool is situated over the open shaft
Scrooge hooks the cane in his pocket get onto the spool and
starts climbing down the elevator cable

It’s a vertiginous view as Scrooge climbs down the cable

BACK ON THE FIRST FLOOR (CONTINUOUS)
The Merlockcockroach flies through the corridor He spots an
open elevator and flies INSIDE

Wings flapping mightily he pushes against the top button with
all his might and bounces off With a look of determination
he revs up again and bangs into the button one more time this
time bouncing to the floor

MERLOCKCOCKROACH
Oof

MEANWHILE HIGH IN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT

Scrooge has climbed down to the first elevator door leading to
the top floor (his office floor) He reaches with his cane to
push a clutch on the back of the door When he does the door
slides open revealing a corridor Scrooge smiles
Meanwhile

BACK INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

The Merlock cockroach sits on the floor looking up at the
button in determination and - BUZZ - shoots toward it
He SMASHES against the button finally causing it to light up
The elevator doors begin to close

BACK IN THE SHAFT (CONTINUOUS)

Scrooge is trying to step over to the open door while hanging
onto the cable when the elevator motors unexpectedly KICK IN
Suddenly he finds himself going up as the cable rises

-SCROOGE
Huh

AS SEEN FROM THE CORRIDOR

Scrooge keeps climbing down as fast as he can but the cables
are moving too quickly for him to stay even with the open
elevator door
INSIDE THE SHAFT
Scrooge looks up to see himself in danger of being rolled up
with the cable into the cable spool

QN SCROOGE AS SEEN FROM THE CORRIDOR
Suddenly the elevator comes up pushing Scrooge out of the way
altogether

SCROOGE
Awk

The elevator stops and the (internal) doors open revealing
the cockroach which comes fluttering out

BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE ELEVATOR AND THE CABLE SPOOL
Ww

e find Scrooge looking squished He grabs his hat which has
been caught in the spool and yanks it out

SCROOGE
Grunt

AND INSIDE THE ELEVATOR
We hear BANGING sounds from above Suddenly the ceiling panel

on the elevator opens and Scrooge drops through with a THUD

SCROOGE
Ooomf

He looks up in bewilderment for a beat and then runs down the
hallway in the same direction as the cockroach

peers in as he hears

When he points he sticks his finger between the spinning
globe and the globe’s latitude arn

DIJON
PAINFUL CRY

The Genie turns in irritation toward Dijon and does a double
take upon seeing

«Scrooge Scrooge puts his fingers to his lips as if to
say Keep quiet

Genie understands and rushes over to Dijon who is still
extracating his finger

DIJON (CONT)
Whimper-whimper

Genie pulls his finger from the globe - POP - and keeps hold
of it to keep Dijon turned his way

GENIE
Are you sure it’s safe to
travel master
(points at window)
Merlock could be close

As Scrooge sneaks toward Dijon and steps off Merlock the
cockroach (wings bent) rattles his head to get his bearings

DIJON (MOSTLY VO)
Do not worry Genie I plan to
be hiring a small army of body
guards

As Scrooge’s eyes light up in anticipation the broken-winged
cockroach suddenly runs up his back down his arn along the
cane and onto the lamp

Merlock quickly transfigures into his human form

MERLOCK
Ha-Ha

GENIE
Shriek
Dijon feeling no lamp in his backside looks sickened

DIJON
Oh no

Scrooge attempts to snatch the lamp back

SCROOGE
Give that back you dirty

With a sweep of his hand Merlock sends him flying

The poor duck CRASHES into a book case Books fall over him
in a CLATTER His walkie-talkie also falls to the ground

The Genie shrinks back as Merlock leans toward him

MERLOCK
Hello again Genie

GENIE
(horrified)
Please Merlock no wishes I-
I can’t take then

On the word times Merlock literally rips off the necklace
in fiery anticipation of what’s to come

MERLOCK
Relax It’s going to be like
old TIMES again

He slowly places the talisman in the lamp As he does an
intense light builds from the lamp so intense that the others
have to shield their eyes

SCROOGE
Och

The light diminishes

MERLOCK
My talisman now gives me
unlimited wishes Scrooge

Dijon is trying to sneak away Merlock blocks him

MERLOCK
And where are you going

DIJON
(very scared)
J-just outside master You
and Genie have so much to catch
up on I thought you might be
wanting a few minutes alone

Merlock grabs Dijon tightly by the scruff of his collar anda
lifts him from the ground

DIJON (CONT)
(choking)
I know I would

MERLOCK
Genie I wish you would turn
this disloyal swine into
something fitting

DIJON
Whimper

The Genie looks distraught as he waves his hands
GENIE
(morosely)
Yeah just like old times

And to Dijon’s shock he POOFS into a pig He scrambles like
crazy as Merlock holds him in his arms

MERLOCK
Booming laugh

laugh)
SQUEALS
Merlock lets go and Dijon scrambles away SQUEALING

He passes by Scrooge who looks shocked

Merlock looks about the surroundings with disdain

MERLOCK
And now Genie I wish you
would transform this mundane
bin into a domicile more worthy
of its new owner

(almost sweetly)

Remember our magnificent old
home

The Genie waves his hands looking upset

GENIE
(to himself)
Whimper Oh yeah Casa de

Coo-Coo

Suddenly the entire room begins to widen and change shape
Book cases melt into the walls The walls and carpeting start
turning into stone Scrooge looks about in astonishment

SCROOGE
(fearfully)
Me bin Me precious bin

INT STAIRWELL (CONTINUOUS)

As the Nephews and Webby are rushing up the stairs that too
begins to widen and transform The kids have to hold onto
each other as the floor shifts and elongates

KIDS
Ad lib cries

AND OUTSIDE (CONTINUOUS)

The bin appears to expand in every direction as it transforms
into a monstrous and gloomy Arabian citadel (Note The top
floor containing Merlock and Scrooge is open air - one big
room surrounded by columns which hold up the rounded roof)

Mrs Beakley steps back in horror as she watches the
transformation from the ground

MRS BEAKLEY
Ooooh

She faints dead away

BACK ON THE TOP FLOOR
Scrooge looks down between the open columns He’s aghast

GENIE
I’m so sorry Mr McDuck

Merlock turns smirking at the Genie

MERLOCK
And now Genie I wish to
return home in my new home

The Genie waves his hand and suddenly there’s a RUMBLING
Scrooge has to hold onto the column to stand As he looks
out he’s surprised to see

EXT THE CITADEL CONTINUOUS

The Citadel begins to rise from its foundation turning ever
so slightly as it elevates into the heavens and drifts over
Duckburg

SCROOGE
This canna be happening

ON THE GROUND
Mrs Beakley is rising re-gaining her bearing when she sees
the citadel flying overhead

MRS BEAKLEY
Ocooh

She faints again
INT STAIRWELL (CONTINUOUS)

The kids stop climbing up the large steps to look out a
portal They can’t believe their eyes

LOUIE
Yeah we’re flying all right

Just then they’re surprised by a bright stream of sunlight
striking the window

EXT FLOATING CITADEL (CONTINUOUS)

The sun is rising over the horizon as the flying citadel heads
east Consequently the sunlight moves across the citadel
from the top down completely illuminating it as it continues
East It’s a sight to make Spielberg whistle

BACK WITH MERLOCK AND SCROOGE - (DAY BUT STILL CONTINUOUS)

Scrooge is fit to be tied He starts stomping toward Merlock

SCROOGE
You maniac Return the bin
before I stuff that lamp down
your throat

The Genie throws up his hands to keep Scrooge back

GENIE
(worriedly)
Uh-uh Bad move Bad

MERLOCK
(booming)
You’d threaten me --

The Genie rushes up to Merlock imploringly

GENTE
Please Merlock He’s had a
lousy day Maybe a hot bath
and a warm glass of goat’s milk
might

Merlock points at Scrooge dramatically

MERLOCK
(interrupting)
Silence I wish you would cast
him out of our house

Both the Genie and Scrooge react in shock The Genie
struggles with himself trying to hold his arms in check

GENIE
Straining groans
No - No

At that moment the Nephews and Webby appear from an
entranceway and watch with alarm

GENIE (VO CONT)
Io- can’t

Merlock angrily leans toward him holding out the lamp

MERLOCK
Do it

And finally the Genie succumbs doing the magical wave

GENIE
(to Scrooge
straining)
I have no choice

SCROOGE
(scared)
I understand --

And Scrooge is suddenly struck by a mighty wind that BLOWS him
and only him He goes sliding across the floor
SCROOGE (CONT)
Whooooah

The Nephews and Webby watch in horror

Just as he is blown off the edge he manages to hook his cane
onto a column He holds on for dear life as the winds
continue to blow

Merlock watches in delight while the Genie can barely look

MERLOCK
Evil chuckle

Just then a marble shoots through scene striking the lamp
which flies from Merlock’s hand

MERLOCK
Wha

The talisman falls out of the lamp and the two objects skid
onto the floor

He looks back to see Dewey with his slingshot Webby is
behind him

DEWEY
Get it guys

Merlock lunges for the lamp but Huey rushes out of nowhere
and kicks it out of the way

Louie grabs it and tosses it to Scrooge

LOUIE
Uncle Scrooge

As Scrooge reaches out to get it his cane CRACKS and he’s
thrown off the building The lamp follows him down

IN SKY

We watch from above as Scrooge falls down down down with
the lamp following after Below him are wispy clouds and the
blue of the ocean

SCROOGE
(fading)
Cry of alarm

Meanwhile Merlock snatches up the talisman He grips it in
his hand as he rises in a fury Even as he threatens the
boys he turns into a hideous GRIFFIN

MERLOCK
I’1l be back for you

As he heads off the edge clutching the talisman the Genie
grabs his tail to stop hin

GENIE
No Don’t

Merlock ignores the Genie and dives over the side The Genie
goes with him

GENIE
Shriek

Webby and the Nephews guickly rush to the edge and look down
fearfully

MERLOCKGRIFFIN
Evil it‘’s-all-over-now
chuckle

KIDS
Gasp

INTHE SKY
As Scrooge falls he spots the lamp above him He makes grabs
for it but it’s out of his reach

Meanwhile the Merlock-Griffin is pumping his powerful wings to
reach the lamp first The Genie holds onto the tail

GENIE
No0-0-0-0-0

The Griffin glances behind him and whips his tail flicking
the Genie off

GENIE
Shriek

Meanwhile Scrooge starts making breast stroke moves toward
the lamp It’s working He looks up and notices the Griffin
getting closer

Scrooge swims twice as fast Just when his fingers are but a
few inches from the lamp the hideous claw of the Griffin
reaches in and plucks it from the air Scrooge looks up
helplessly as the Griffin smirks down at hin
Then with a look of determination Scrooge tears open his
jacket which puffs out like a parachute All at once he
seems to shoot up as he rams into the Griffin with such force
that the Griffin not only loses the lamp but the talisman as
well

MERLOCK-GRIFFIN
Pained screech

The SCREECH turns into a SCREAM as the griffin changes back
into Merlock

MERLOCK (CONT)
SCREAM OF ALARM

Scrooge quickly snatches the lamp in mid-air
Meanwhile the falling Genie grabs Scrooge’s arm from above

GENIE
This time you have to make a
wish

Scrooge holds the lamp and says

SCROOGE
Aye I wish me and me bin were
back in Duckburg - right now

The Genie waves his hand and - POOF - he and Scrooge
disappear

And in the sky - POOF - the entire floating citadel disappears
with the kids Meanwhile

As we look down Merlock plummets to his doom He is out of
sight when the talisman also falls into scene albeit more
slowly since it’s lighter Clearly Merlock will never
retrieve it

MERLOCK
(fading out)
Blood-curdling scream)

CUT TO
EXT DUCKBURG THE SITE OF THE MONEY BIN

After a beat - POOF - the money bin magically reappears on the
same spot Everything is back to normal

INT OFFICE

The Genie and Scrooge are on the floor in a heap The Genie
climbs off Scrooge as they get their bearing The kids are
looking out the window

GENIE
Good wishin’

WEBBY
We’re back

HUEY
It’s like we never left

FAVORING SCROOGE who looks about in wonder
SCROOGE
Bless me bag pipes I thought
I’d never see these walls
again

He gazes into his open vault to look at his money

SCROOGE
And me rolling hills of
money Sign Has any

heather looked more heavenly

As Scrooge turns away the Dijonpig pops out of a pile of
money with a look of surprise

DIJONPIG
SNORTY Huh

Meanwhile

BACK IN THE OFFICE - Louie points at the lamp still in
Scrooge’s hand

LOUIE
Gee you still have the lamp
Uncle Scrooge

Scrooge looks at it and scowls

SCROOGE
And one more wish to go
WEBBY
You sound like you know what it

is

Scrooge holds up the lamp

SCROOGE
Aye I’m going to stop all this
magic even if I have to wish
for the lamp to be buried in
the center of the Earth

The Genie looks horrified as the children protest

GENIE
Wah

KIDS
No You can’t Not that

HUEY
Genie will be gone forever

GENIE
Yeah aren’t we over-reacting

Scrooge agrees He holds up the lamp

SCROOGE
You’re right Nobody should
spend a minute in this stink
pot
(lifts the lamp)
Still it’s too dangerous to
keep around

Louie points to the vault as the Dijonpig peeks out the vault
door which is ajar

LOUIE
Hide it in the vault

The kids put arms around Genie as they speak

DEWEY
And we’ll dress him up like a
boy and keep him in our room

HUEY
Just like before

GENIE
(nodding)
Much better

Scrooge is in ponderous thought as he looks at the kids
SCROOGE

Too chancy But you’ve just
given me a plaid dandy idea
Scrooge holds up the lamp preparing to make a wish

SCROOGE
Genie get ready to grant my
last wish - and yours too

Everyone looks apprehensive

GENIE
(apprehensively)
What’d you mean

SCROOGE
(concentrating)
I wish the Genie would turn
into a real boy

The Genie does a TAKE as his hands start doing circular waves
creating a swirl of light around him

GENIE
(surprised)
Shabooey --

The swirl becomes brighter and stronger until the Genie is
completely enveloped in a tornado of multi-colored light The
others have to shield their eyes including the Dijonpig

Then in the biggest POOF of all there stands a boy-ish
version of Genie He’s the same size as the Nephews and
wears a similar cap and shirt

GENIE-Boy
Gasp

The Nephews excitedly collect around him

NEPHEWS WEBBY
Quackaroonie Neato Wow

The Genie looks at his new hands and outfit

GENIE-BOY
I’m a boy

He rushes to a full length mirror and looks at himself in
astonishment

GENIE-BOY
I’m a real boy Now I can do
all the things real boys do
Run through fields Play
catch Roll over

(He takes)
Wait That’s a dog

Just then Huey points at the lamp

HUEY
Gasp Uncle Scrooge The
lamp

Flakes are falling off as it corrodes in Scrooge’s hands

SCROOGE
Aye without the Genie

Scrooge steps on a waste basket pedal flipping the lid open
Even as he moves to drop the lamp into the basket it corrodes
so guickly it falls through his hands

SCROOGE (CONT)
it’s wasting away

INSIDE THE VAULT DOOR

As soon as the corroding pieces of the lamp fall into the
basket a magical effect comes over the Dijonpig who still
hides inside the vault In a POOF he changes back to Dijon
He feels his torso with an expression that seems to sayYes
Yes I’m back Thank heavens

DIJON
(to himself)
Whimpers of happiness

Just then something catches his eye

DIJON’S POV - SCROOGE’S MONEY
A panoramic SHOT of money jewels gold bars etc as far as
the eye can see

CLOSE ON DIJON
who gives the CAMERA one of those conspiratorial Sylvester-
just-saw-Tweety-Pie looks Meanwhile

BACK IN THE OFFICE
Genie-boy is so happy he hugs Scrooge practically knocking
him over

GENIE-BOY
How can I ever thank you
master

SCROOGE

I’m not your master anymore

GENIE-BOY
That’s right Can I call you
Uncle Scrooge

SCROOGE
You’re a sweet kid but donna
press your luck

Dewey steps up to Gene

DEWEY
So what do you want to do on
your first day as a boy

Genie-boy thinks for a beat then

GENIE-BoY
Well let me put it this way
(gangster voice)
You’ll never catch me coppers

And the Genie-boy heads out the door with the Nephews chasing
after

NEPHEWS
Two excited wallas One fake
siren

Meanwhile Scrooge is stepping out onto a diving board in his
bin Webby sticks her head in (Note The bin should
contain not only cash but bars of gold precious gems pots of
jewelry)

WEBBY
Are you comin’ with us Uncle
Scrooge

SCROOGE

You go ahead Webby dear
He playfully bounces on the board getting ready for a dive
SCROOGE
We quadzillionaires have our
own ideas of fun

As he bounces up to dive he catches something out of the
corner of his eye and reacts

SCROOGE (CONT)
WAK

Scrooge lands back feet first on the board which shakes
THWACKA-THWACKA-THWACKA) as he looks back at Dijon

Dijon has his back against the wall as he is trying to sneak
out climbing up the steps which run up the wall and lead to
the vault door It is obvious by his bloated appearance that
Dijon has stuffed a ton of riches in his shirt and pants
Weve never seen his clothes this stretched Even his turban
is bulging

SCROOGE
You

ON DIJON He smiles nervously at Scrooge while continuing to
Climb the stairs clutching his waistband to hold up his
pants
DIJON

(aS casual as he can be)

Scrooge sir Good golly what

a time we have had TI was just

leaving
EXT BIN
Suddenly we hear

DIJON
BIG WHIMPERING CRY

SCROOGE
(under whimpers)
Come back here

Money spills from Dijon as he speedily waddles out the bin
with Scrooge chasing after

As the two head toward the sunrise
FADE OUT

THE END
