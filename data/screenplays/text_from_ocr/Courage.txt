EXT CAMACHO’S RANCH - MORNING

Athletic slim ALENA CAMACHO culls a spirited
stallion from the corral into a training pen It skirts

Cautious Alena approaches the SNORTING beast From a
pouch at her side she pulls out a fresh horse biscuit
The aroma offers intrigue

ALENA
There beauty Easy boy

Sauntering over the stallion gently nibbles from Alena’s
hand

Distraction allows Alena to bridle the horse

Scrambling onto the horse’s back Alena grabs the reins
as the test of wills commence The stallion rears and
bolts as Alena anticipates every move WILD SNORTS fill
the morning silence

From the barn Alenas brother MARCELO CAMACHO races out and into the pen to grab the reins Alena
masterfully navigates the horse around Marcelo and in
control circles the pen jerking Marcelo off his feet

Senor Falcon didn’t think I was
fully committed when I escorted
you out He replaced me with the
great Bernardo Sanchez

ALENA
Bernardo He’s a misogynistic pig

GABRIEL
I’m not the president of his fan
club But he’s controversial
draws an audience and that’s what
this is all about drawing an
audience

Alena’s confusion and irritation returns

apple to drop But it made a
difference

Alena processes the idea

from

To succeed Falcon needs a full
stadium He can’t lose half the
population You represent their
core market the family You’re
black listed your own family

like a compelling story An
emotional story that can capture
the reader You just have to make
people care for you Then Falcon
will care

The great recortadore BERNARDO SANCHEZ stands in
the center of the ring directing the action

Jessica races into the arena from behind the barriers and
the cow chases her to a safety barrier

Jessica tags Kacy who takes off across the arena The cow
gives chase The game of tag is on The girls keep the
cow on the run from one safety barrier to the next The
cow SNORTS visibly exhausted

Kacy easily reaches Lin-Lu who notices the exhausted
cow’s hesitation and jogs toward the next safety barrier
The cow gives a half-hearted pursuit

BERNARDO
Run This isn’t a bus stop

Inga takes the tag and jogs across the arena With
labored BREATH the cow stumbles to a halt and flops down
exhausted

Emboldened Inga bows to her teammates who APPLAUDS her

Incensed Bernardo rushes over and kicks the cow with his
boot

BERNARDO
Move you stupid animal

Eva rushes out with the CAMERA CREW in tow She turns to
the film crew realizing the ongoing recording

EVA
Don’t film this

Eva turns her anger to Bernardo
EVA
Is this your idea of uplifting and

empowering

Bernardo just shrugs his shoulder indifferent to the
woman’s anger

BERNARDO
Oh shut up
Bernardo looks around as if searching for something
BERNARDO
No audience for your tired ass
whining I answer to Falcon You
belong in the stands not
interfering with things you know
nothing about
Eva turns her anger on her camera crew still filming
EVA
This is not to be used Get out of
here
Bernardo interprets her words as if directed at him

stumbles and falls

At the last instance Miguel rushes past Alena and draws
off the cow with a masterful sweep of his cape

Alena scrambles behind the safety barrier

GABRIEL
You failed

An angry Alena pokes her head from behind the barrier but
doesn’t step back into the arena

ALENA
What was that

Gabriel motions Alena over

GABRIEL
This is not a game The animal’s
natural instinct is to charge and
gore They are faster than you
Understand them so you can
anticipate their moves

ALENA
I wasn’t ready

GABRIEL
Yea That’s what the rat said just
before the cat ate it Cats don’t
care if rats are ready Always be
ready for ANYTHING

your life

GABRIEL
In ancient Minoan times a key
cultural ritual was the veneration
of the bull’s power Men and
women EQUALS worshipped the bull
by risking death

ALENA
They did more than jump old cows

GABRIEL

True The extinct giant AUROCHS
were not cows They stood over six
feet at the shoulders with hooves
the size of a man’s head and they
weighed well over a ton

ALENA
How did anyone jump them

GABRIEL

If the ancient frescos are true
they did more than that From this
ritual the Greeks created the
gymnastics of today

ALENA
Well I’m jumping sticks and tired
old cows

GABRIEL

waiting for the next round of wind sprints Gabriel
shouts a command

GABRIEL
Go

A dust cloud rises as the women sprint and stagger across
the arena As the drills continue more women drop out

have an advantage in agility

starts to exit Gabriel puts his hand on her arm

Gabriel motions to the lights of a storefront up ahead
going dark

EXTINT LA FAMILIA OFFICE - NIGHT

On a misty dark street lights and SOUNDS coming through
a window breaks the night’s silence

Inside a printing press runs As the press cranks out
copies of ‘La Familia’ Alena turns to Gabriel

ALENA
I’ve been reading your book It’s
the story of heroes In the
margins I found--

GABRIEL
The soul is found in expressions
of the heart That was the
passage I believe you are
referring to Scheherazade’s my
heroes nickname She made the
IMPOSSIBLE happen through stories
(beat) She made the IMPOSSIBLE
happen in my life

ALENA
She What does it mean

Gabriel closes his eyes for a moment He reaches out and
takes Alena’s hand and places it over his heart

GABRIEL
I truly believe if you can touch
someone’s heart anything is
possible I’m not native Spanish
My family left the Zagros
mountains when I was eight and my
brother fifteen One day a
neighbor was beaten and taken
away My father had an important
job and believed it would pass
Mom convinced him it would not
That night we left the country
Soon after every Christian in the
village was murdered

ALENA
How did you end up in Spain I
remember Germany and Belgian
taking in refugees but did Spain

GABRIEL
You didn’t at least not many
They held refugees for years in
containment camps

CLANG
The press smokes and GRINDS to a halt

A tired Gabriel throws the power switch off and breaks
down the printing press

GABRIEL
I’1l get this working Go home
You have a competition

ALENA
If Scheherazade had gone home
what would have happened to the
king

Gabriel smiles as he works on the press and continues his
story

GABRIEL
Spain offered to take in a few
There was a catch no boys or men
over thirteen My father offered
to leave with my brother My
mother had another solution She
walked into the Spanish Embassy
and through her WORDS reached a
heart They made an exception

ALENA
Id like to meet her

Gabriel notices Alena yawning He puts down what he’s
doing and walks her over to a small room In it is a cot

GABRIEL
Rest I’1ll wake you when we’re
printing again Oh there’s a
shower back there if you wish

Alena nods too tired to argue Gabriel’s surprised when
she leans forward and gives him a light kiss

She curls up on the cot Gabriel covers her with a
blanket and cuts out the room light He returns to the
printing press

giant fresco of a magnificent
bull Men and women leaping and
playing with it It scared and
excited me

Reporter appears confused

ALENA
The way I see it our lives are
composed of a mosaic of beautiful
and fearful memories We can’t
escape them The day to day is
brushed aside and forgotten So I
search out beautiful experiences
and pluck them up like a child
collecting pretty shells on the
beach And when I’m old I will
take them out and hold them up to
the light (beat) Excuse me
