Union fear each other’s nuclear capabilities - and
intentions Both sides deploy spies - and hunt for them
INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS

CLOSE ON AN ELDERLY MAN

Reflected in a grimy mirror The mirror is propped up on a
chair next to an open window looking out from the fourth
floor onto a Brooklyn skyline

Pull back to show the man sitting in a shabby
workshopstudio He looks from the mirror down at a canvas
in front of him as he daubs paint onto a self-portrait

The telephone rings

The old man rests his brush on the easel and walks to a table
cluttered with papers and shortwave radios He picks up the
phone and listens but doesn’t say anything

FULTON STREET

The old man Rudolf Abel emerges from the building walks
along the street

TITLE BROOKLYN

An Agent follows Abel

SUBWAY TRAIN INTERIOR

The Agent watches Abel as the train stops at Broad Street
The Agent now joined by a second Agent follows him at a
distance Abel dabs at his nose with a handkerchief The
agents lose him in the crush of commuters They emerge from
the station and consult two other Agents No sign of Abel
First Agent heads back down the stair smashing BANG right
into Abel who’s coming up the stairs

Abel looks up surprised Then mildly

ABEL
Excuse me

The agent equally surprised watches as Abel makes his way
around him

A distant siren fades up and crosses the cut to
INT CAR

The Agents drive past Abel who is seated on a park bench
overlooking the East River painting

AGENT
(to Driver)
Go ahead and park around the corner
AT THE RIVERSIDE
Abel sets down his palette
Close on his hand adjusting his easel then feeling under
the bench His hand closes on something held by a magnet to
the bench’s steel frame below the wood seat-slats it is a
nickel
Back to Abel sitting Picks up his palette
MANHATTAN STREET

A seedy part of town Abel walks toward a building the
HOTEL LATHAM

INSIDE THE ROOM

As Abel lets himself in A very modest room He sets down
his portable easel and case Sets his work-in-progress
canvass on a standing easel drapes his jacket over a chair
hangs his hat on the easel He turns on a table fan

He fishes the nickel from his pocket retrieves a razor from
the bathroom and uses it to carefully to open it It is
hollow

Inside is a piece of paper folded accordion-style into a
small square

Abel unfolds it Holds it up to a magnifier lamp Written
on the paper a sequence of numerals

STREET OUTSIDE HOTEL
Two government cars skid to a stop and the Agents pour out
HALLWAY

The Agents run down the corridor
121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 3

ABEL’S ROOM

Its door is being busted in

The Agents swarm in They have guns They come up short
The small room is empty The easel with a work in progress
upon it stands before the window which stands open gentle
wind playing at the sheers

Outside a fire escape The man seems to have left

An Agent inspects a closed door The bathroom -- Rudolf
Abel steps out in his briefs Standing in the doorway

cigarette in mouth we see him as a frail vulnerable old
man

He freezes not scared just surprised He looks at the men
They look at him

At last he speaks with colorless quasi-British accent

ABEL
Visitors

A beat

ABEL (CONTD)
--Would you mind if I fetch my
teeth

Two of the agents Blasco and Gamber look at each other
confused Abel gestures back towards the bathroom

BLASCO
Colonel would you turn around
please

Blasco turns Abel around checks to make sure he’s not armed

BLASCO (CONTD)
Sit down On the bed

Blasco and Gamber walk him to the bed He sits
ABEL
(gesturing toward

bathroom)
The teeth are on the sink

( )
121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 4

GAMBER
Look at me We are agents from the
federal government

Abel scans the Agents who surround him

GAMBER (CONTD)
Look at me I’m talking to you We
have received information concerning
your involvement in espionage You
can either cooperate with us right
now or you’ll be under arrest Do
you understand Colonel

Blasco heads into the bathroom

ABEL
Not really Why do you keep calling
me “Colonel”

Blasco returns and with care hands him his teeth Abel puts
them in

BLASCO
You need to get dressed

GAMBER
We have to search your apartment

Abel points at the art materials on the table

ABEL
Would you mind if I cleaned my
palette The paints will get ruined
otherwise Just behind you there
I have a cloth myself

Abel stands Blasco hands him his palette

ABEL (CONT’D)
Thank you

BLASCO
(to the other men)
Start searching please

ABEL

Would you put this out in the
ashtray On the windowsill there

( )
121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 5

While an Agent does this and the other Agents begin the
search Abel holding the palette grabs a small scrap of
paper -- the one from the nickel bearing a series of
numerals

As the agents explore the room Abel uses the paper to wipe
the palette clean

ABEL (CONTD)
Don’t want this to get spoiled

The wet paint obliterates the code As the agents continue
to toss the room

PRE-LAP

Mellow jazz piano
DISSOLVE TO

INT THE HARVARD CLUB

Two middle-aged men sit in club chairs facing each other
Each holds a tumbler of scotch

DONOVAN
Don’t say “my guy” He’s not “my
guy”

BATES

Yes he’s your guy Who’re we
talking about

DONOVAN
Were talking about a guy who is
insured by my client So don’t make
him “my guy”

BATES
Okay fine my point is he -- the
guy insured by your client -- he
doesn’t deny any of these things
happened --

DONOVAN

“These things”

BATES
Yes These five things

DONOVAN

Wait Hold it hold it hold it
Not five things one thing

( )

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

BATES
Clearly it’s five things
DONOVAN
Well -- I’m sorry -- it’s not clear

to me Five things Explain it to
me

BATES
It’s self-evident

DONOVAN
Okay then tell me what happened
tell me the story in a way that
makes sense For five things

BATES

Fine Absolutely Your guy --
DONOVAN

Not my guy Insured by my client
BATES

The guy insured by your client -- is

driving down State Highway 19 when
he loses control of his car hits my
five guys The five guys who hired
me to represent them because you’re
not honoring your claim

DONOVAN
You mean my client is not honoring
the claim The insurance company

BATES
Mr Donovan we’re all clear on
who’s who here

DONOVAN
Except my client honors every
claim They do Mr Bates every
single legitimate claim Up to the
limit of their liability which is
100000 per accident in the case of
this man’s policy And this is one
claim according to your
description “He hit my five guys”
The guy insured by my client had one
accident one one one losing
control of the car and hitting five
motorcyclists

( )
121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 7

BATES
From their point of view five
things happened

DONOVAN
Look Bob -- may I Bob
(gestures to self)
Jim If I go bowling and I throw a
strike one thing happened Ten
things didn’t happen

BATES
Jim My clients are not bowling
pins As much your guy might have
treated them so --

DONOVAN

Lemme finish If your house is
insured to 100000 and a tornado
carries it away it carried away one
house It didn’t pick up every
stick of furniture and destroy it in
a separate incident If that’s what
youre saying well then there is
never any limit to our liability and
that is the end of the insurance
business And then Bob nobody is
safe

RECEPTION WATTERS COWAN AND DONOVAN

Donovan steps into a plush office suite The receptionist
works a busy switchboard

RECEPTIONIST (ON PHONE)

Natalie leaves All three men take their seats
GOODNOUGH

Okay Here’s the thing The Soviet
spy they caught We want you to

defend him (pause) Here’s the
indictment
Slap -- he drops a thick document onto the coffee table

Silence

Donovan looks at it but doesn’t reach for it He is
absorbing the news

DONOVAN
Well

More silence

DONOVAN (CONTD)
-I’m not sure I should pick that
up

WATTERS
The accused doesn’t know any
lawyers The Federal Court tossed
it into our lap The Bar Committee
took a vote You were the unanimous
choice

GOODNOUGH
It was important to us -- it’s
important to our country Jim --
that this man is seen as getting a
fair shake American justice will
be on trial

DONOVAN
Well of course when you put it
that way it’s an honor to be asked

But -- Lynn -- I’m an insurance
lawyer I haven’t done criminal work
in years

GOODNOUGH

Well it’s like riding a bike isn’t
it You distinguished yourself at
Nuremberg

( )

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

DONOVAN
I was on the prosecution team

GOODNOUGH
Not the point you’re no stranger to
criminal law Jim look at the
situation The man is publicly
reviled

DONOVAN
And I will be too

GOODNOUGH
Yes in more ignorant quarters But
that’s exactly why this has to be
done -- and capably done It can’t
look like our justice system tosses
people on the ash heap

Thinking beat

DONOVAN
Suppose I didwhat’s the evidence
look like

GOODNOUGH
Pretty overwhelming

DONOVAN
Great Great Everyone will hate me
but at least I’ll lose (to
Watters) What do you think Tom
The firm’ll suffer I have work
here

WATTERS
I think it’s a patriotic duty this
is an important mission I told
Lynn the firm can’t say no and
youd have a tough time saying no
too I think you have to defend the
sonofabitch

WILLIAMS
Okay drivers here’s the deal You
have been selected for a mission
which you are not to discuss with
anyone outside of this room No
one I don’t care who you trust --
wife mother sweetheart the good
lord when you pray at night -- you
don’t tell any of ‘em anything of
what I’m about to tell you Each of
you drivers has met certain
qualifications -- high level
security clearance exceptional
pilot ratings in excess of the
required hours flight time in a
single seat aircraft We are
engaged in a war This war does not
-- for the moment -- involve men at
arms It involves information You
will be collecting information You
will be gathering intelligence about
the enemy -- the intelligence you
gather could give us the upper hand
in a full thermonuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union Or it could
prevent one For public purposes --
as far as your wife or mother or
sweetheart or the good lord above --
your mission does not exist If it
does not exist you do not exist
You cannot be shot down You cannot
be captured

Taxi

But it passes straight by

Donovan yells after it

behind Donovan experiments with picking up his pace

The man behind seems to match it

The pursuer is briefly blocked by several men exiting an
apartment building

Donovan uses this moment to crouch behind a car trying to
control his breathing Quiet

The pursuer runs as far as the corner

The footsteps stop A beat as the pursuer surveys the empty
street

Then they resume coming closer and the man circles the
parked car to look down at Donovan

MAN
Mr Donovan

Donovan is unsure whether to be embarrassed or afraid

DONOVAN

MAN
Ok well listen I understand

gamesmanship and I understand that

agree to the rules and that’s what
makes us Americans it’s all that
makes us Americans So don’t tell
me there’s no rule book and don’t
nod at me like that you sonofabitch

The man stops nodding and just looks at Donovan appraising
him Donovan smiles and gets up from the table gathers his
things

MAN
Do we need to worry about you

DONOVAN
Not if I’m left alone to do my job

He grabs a peanut from the dish on the table and walks away
as he pops it into his mouth

AIRPLANE HANGAR

The doors of the hangar split like a metal curtain and roll
back Powers and the other pilots stare in expectantly

TITLE PESHAWAR AIR STATION PAKISTAN

Sitting in the shadows is a huge black aircraft The
streamlined body of a glider enormous wings The U-2 The
pilots begin to surround it examining it

WILLIAMS
From this moment forward you will
not refer to the U-2 as a spy plane
or reconnaissance aircraft You
will refer to it as “the article”
“The article” has an eighty-foot
wingspan Powered by a single Pratt
and Whitney J57 P37 engine 10000
pounds of thrust Maximum speed of
430 miles an hour She may not be
quick but at your cruising altitude
of 70000 feet nothing will come
close to you

POWERS
Seventy-thousand

( )
121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27

WILLIAMS
The idea is the enemy doesn’t even
know you’re there

Powers smiles it’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen
The other pilots fan out Joe Murphy looks at the tail
attached with three short bolts

MURPHY
Looks kinda flimsy

WILLIAMS
Every extra pound of weight costs a
foot in altitude and we need to
accommodate the cameras

The pilots gather around a structure on which is mounted
several camera lenses

DONOVAN (CONTD)
So that search and the evidence
that is the fruit of that search
that’s all tainted and should not be
admitted

TOMPKINS
What protections is he due your
honor The man is not -- the man

is what “Rudolf Ivanovich Abel”
he is a Soviet citizen he is not an
American

DONOVAN
1886 Yick Wo v Hopkins the court
held that even aliens in that case
Chinese immigrants could not be
held to answer for a crime without
due process of lawincluding any
alien that entered this country
illegally --

JUDGE BYERS
The Department of Justice has its
first allegiance to the United
States I don’t see how an alien
if he’s here illegally how he
suffered deprivation of rights
Rights as what An American
Rights as what counselor

In no uncertain terms

JUDGE BYERS (CONT’D)
We are in a battle for civilization
This Russian spy came here to

a bruise under one eye

DONOVAN
Hm what’s going on in here

ROGER
Okay Dad this is really important
When the war begins the first thing
they do is cut off all the water and
all the electricity So the first
thing we should do is keep this
filled and use the shower in your

garden house outside --

DONOVAN
Those are good ideas But Roger I
don’t see this as being something
you ever have to worry about

ROGER
But when you hear the sirens there
may not be enough time to fill up
the tub and the sinks

DONOVAN
There are not going to be any
sirens What is this

Roger lifts a drawing he made from a small table strewn with
magazine articles

ROGER
When the bomb comes the Reds will
aim for the Empire State Building
But the bomb goes off at 10000 feet
up In Life Magazine it’s called
an airburst and if the bomb is 50
megatons the “blast wave” goes out
and out and out and melts
everything from here to here (points
to his drawing)-- including where we
livehere

Donovan takes the drawing sits down on the covered toilet

DONOVAN
Roger nobody’s dropping atomic
bombs on us

ROGER
But the Russians want to You know
the guy you’re defending he’s here
to get things ready for the guys who
drop the bombs

DONOVAN
He isn’t here for that And he’s
not even a Russianhe was born we
think in Northern England

ROGER
But he’s a spy for Russia I don’t
even understand what you’re doing
Youre not a Communist so why are
you defending one

ABEL (CONT’D)
Oh thank you very much

Donovan lights Abel’s cigarette Abel draws on it and
smiles

ABEL (CONT’D)
You’ve never asked me if the charges
were true If I am indeed a spy

DONOVAN
This is how we do it the case
against you matters Making them
prove it matters The fiction is
whether you did it or not doesn’t

that you’re a spy

ABEL

DONOVAN

Oh Then she’s an angel
Abel now seated at the table smokes regards Donovan

ABEL
You know sitting there like that --
you remind me of a man who used to
come to our house when I was young
My father used to tell me “Watch
this man” So I did Every time he
came and never once did he do
anything remarkable

DONOVAN
And I remind you of him

ABEL
This one time when I was the age of
your son our house was overrun --
by partisan border guards Dozens
of them My father was beaten My
mother was beaten And this man my
father’s friend -- he was beaten
And I watched this man Every time
they hit him he stood back up
again So they hit him harder
Still he got back to his feet I
think because of this they stopped
the beating They let him live

legal There are bigger issues

He can’t quite get his tie right rips it off

JUDGE BYERS (CONTD)
Bigger issues

He moves into the dining room tries again with the tie in a

The Judge turns to face him

JUDGE BYERS
Why I’m not saying I’ve made up my
mind but if he was going to
cooperate work with the government
he’d have done it already

DONOVAN
True but if he --

Very sharp nettled at the interruption

JUDGE BYERS
Excuse me (a beat of silence to
make clear that the floor is his
then moves into the next room to try
at yet another mirror) You can’t say
it’s in the best interests of the
United States that he spend the rest

is this the national interest

down and turns back to the mirror and his tie

DONOVAN

That’s my business what-ifs I’m
in insurance There’s nothing
implausible about this one it’s
entirely in the realm of what could

insurance for If we send this guy
to his death we leave ourselves wide
open No policy in our back pocket

CIA HEADQUARTERS -- LOBBY

Donovan sits waiting and staring at the CIA seal on the
wall

CIA HEADQUARTERS -- DULLES’ OFFICE
As Donovan enters

DULLES (0C)
Mr Donovan thank you so much for
coming

DONOVAN
It’s a pleasure to meet you Mr
Dulles It’s an honor sir

Allen Dulles (70’s) hands Donovan a cup of coffee

DULLES
Nescafe cream two lumps

DONOVAN
Thank you

Dulles lifts the letter from a sideboard

DULLES
Okay This letter you received It
seems pretty clear that the Soviets
are making an overture here
They’re doing it through East
Germany because they still don’t
want to acknowledge Abel is a Soviet
citizen much less a Soviet spy So
a lot of fiction going on

DONOVAN
Yes sir But -- to what end

DULLES
They’ve got our guy our spy pilot
weve got their guy

He hands the letter to agent Hoffman

DULLES (CONTD)
A prisoner exchange I think that’s
what they’re after Which could
hardly be a surprise to you
counselor it’s an eventuality that
I think you foresaw

( )
121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 54

DONOVAN
Yeah I sure did And I’m so rarely
right

Dulles chuckles The three men cross the large office to
Dulles’ desk where he takes a seat and Donovan and Hoffman
do the same

DULLES
Well congratulations Red-letter
day Now we have our man over
there Powers -- a good man -- but
with awith a head full of
classified information Abel has a
head full of classified information
too but he hasn’t given us a lick

DONOVAN
And sir take it from me -- he
won’t

DULLES

Yes we know that but the Russians
don’t They want their man back
before he cracks and we want Powers
back for the same reasons

DONOVAN
I think you’re saying sir there
might be a happy ending for
everybody --

DULLES
Yes if we um indulge their
fiction

He lights a pipe studies Donovan

DULLES (CONTD)
We want you to negotiate the swap
because you’re a private citizen so
it’s not governments talking They
don’t acknowledge Abel as a Soviet
citizen and we don’t acknowledge
East Germany as a sovereign country
We haven’t recognized East Berlin
since it was annexed by the Soviets
in ‘45

DONOVAN
So I act as negotiator representing

( )

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

DULLES
Youre not representing anybody
You’re not a government official
you have no official standing

DONOVAN
Sosome fiction on our side as
well

DULLES
Correct Which means of course you
can’t rely on any acknowledgment or
help if things go south The CIA
can’t be responsible we can’t be
embarrassed

DONOVAN
And where do they want this
negotiation to take place

DULLES
There

DONOVAN
There

DULLES

East Berlin

DONOVAN
But isn’t East Berlin getting
rather

DULLES
Well yes the place is
gettingcomplicated

HOFFMAN

Yeah complicated The Soviet side
has been setting up checkpoints for
the past few months to try to stop
people hemorrhaging to the Western
sectors It hasn’t worked We have
intelligence to suggest that they
may go one step further and wall off
the entire Eastern sector

Donovan is concerned thinking

DULLES
Okay -- that’s it in a nutshell
The decision is entirely yours If
you need time to kick it around

( )
121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 56

After a pensive beat --

DONOVAN
No No I don’t

DULLES
Well fine Fine

He rises to shake Donovan’s hand

DULLES (CONTD)
Of course it’s be best if this all
remains confidential Let’s not
discuss any of this with uh(a
discreet look to an open file on the
table) Mary or with anyone else
Share the correspondence only with
us It’ll let us know what they
want to do and when

All three men walk toward the door

DONOVAN
I have no client no wife no
government Don’t quite know what
I’m doing or when or who for

DULLES
Youre doing it for your country
But your country doesn’t know that

yet
DONOVAN
What about my client the other
person in this equation -- my guy
DULLES

“Your guy” You mean the Russian
He’s not your guy any more
counselor your guy is Francis Gary
Powers now

DONOVAN
And what do I tell Rudolf Abel

DULLES
Tell him not to drop dead

He mounts his bike and rides along the wall a camera around

his neck and a satchel slung over his shoulder

Eastern Berliners trying to cross are dragged back by
soldiers

One mother with her children shouts across to her husband
stranded on the Eastern side

As the wall reaches further upward more and more people
arrive on both sides Some climb down from apartment
windows dangling while others below try to catch them

ON THE STREET

Pryor now walking his bicycle arrives at a gap in the
construction Supplies here are piled up but no workers have

yet been dispatched to this section

A brief look back and forth and then Pryor pushes his bike
into the Eastern sector

TITLE EAST BERLIN

Pryor pulls up outside an austere-looking apartment block
He leans his bike against the wall enters the building

APARTMENT INTERIOR

She shrugs

KATJE
He went to see It’s where he goes
What’re you doing here

PRYOR
I came to get you and your father
You have to come with me You might
not get out tomorrow

KATJE
Just -- leave

PRYOR
Yes yes yes leave Right now

MINUTES LATER

The young man and young woman push their bikes quickly amid
tanks and soldiers

Up ahead is the street where he crossed through into the
East Soldiers are now at work there

PRYOR
Go back Go back

A few armed soldiers notices the couple They start toward
them

PRYOR (CONTD)
I’1l be okay I’m American Go back
to your father’s we’ll find another

She eases off starts to walk away

The soldier calls to her in German She turns walking
backwards shrugs answers in German still retreating

The soldiers are upon Pryor Pryor holds his palms up in
apology

The soldier yells at him as he reaches forward grabs the
camera round his neck and yanks it snapping the strap He
shakes the camera in Pryor’s face yelling

A second soldier grabs his bike and tosses it aside

PRYOR (CONTD)
My name is Frederic Pryor I’m an
economics student Student

He withdraws a binder from his satchel

PRYOR (CONTD)
It’s my dissertation my thesis
The Foreign Trade System of the
European Communist Nations

The soldier takes it from him

PRYOR (CONTD)
There’s a lot of work

The soldier hands it off to another soldier

PRYOR (CONTD)
(as he reaches for it) And that’s my
only copy --

The reach was a mistake as the second soldier knocks him
down Katje watching from a distance is terrified for him

DONOVAN HOME -- MASTER BEDROOM

A rushed DONOVAN is tossing dress shirts into an open
suitcase on the bed MARY watches tersely

DONOVAN
Came up at the last minute They
have offices in London These
clients not my idea Scotland a
fishing expedition

It’s obvious to Donovan that she doesn’t believe a word
Mary’s too smart for this and of late their life has been
far too strange

MARY
(pointedly)
What kind of fishing Jim

DONOVAN
Salmon fishing

( )
121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 60

MARY
Just tell me that you’re not going
to be in any danger That it’s a
routine business trip and I won’t
worry

Donovan keeps moving he doesn’t have time to pause

DONOVAN
I need my passport

She opens the dresser drawer so he can retrieve it

MARY
Just give me something to hold onto
I don’t even care if it’s the truth

Donovan reaches for her gently holds her waist

He refers to the State Department man in the front passenger
seat The driver is someone with an extremely thick neck and
fleshy ears

Michener has his arm hooked around the seat to talk back

MICHENER
Soit’s gotten goddamn
complicated

DONOVAN
Uh-huh

MICHENER
As you know the last letter from
“Mrs

MICHENER (CONTD)
Abel” whoever she is talks about
her lawyer in East Berlin Mr
Vogel whoever he is “Representing
her interests” she says

DONOVAN
Yeah Vogel says he’s gone to the
Russian embassy in East Berlin and
they may be ready to trade Abel for
Powers We don’t know who’s who
but they’re all basically the
Russian right

MICHENER
Well Soviet -- we think so

DONOVAN
Wuddya mean Can we turn up the
heat in here

Michener talks to the driver in German The man shrugs
tweaks a knob on the dash

MICHENER
There’s a wrinkle -- uh -- uh --
they might try to throw you a curve
ball try and get you to accept
another prisoner other than Powers

DONOVAN
Another American

MICHENER
The East German Stasi picked up an
American student -- Frederic Pryor --

a kid they found on the wrong side
of the wall He’s a grad student
out of Yale came over here to study
economics So they’re making
noises about trying this kid for
espionage grave offense capital
crime Well Vogel got in touch
with us said he represents Pryor

DONOVAN
Wait a minute Vogel represents
“Mrs Abel” and this kid

MICHENER
Yeah he’s -- busy

( )
121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 62

DONOVAN
So -- what is he He really is East
German Or Russian

MICHENER
Well -- try to figure it out when
you meet him Russian Embassy East
Berlin noon tomorrow Hoffman will
show you how to get there

DONOVAN
Show me how to get there But I’m
going to have an escort

Uncomfortable silence Donovan notes it

DONOVAN (CONTD)
Right

Michener is uncomfortable

MICHENER
Well that was the plan but -- like
I said there’s a wrinkle I won’t
be taking you The decision has
been made no US government
personnel are to cross the border
until further notice

DONOVAN
How come

MICHENER
Too dangerous The East Germans
grabbed this kid There’s a degree
of impunity uh that we had not
anticipated The point is that the
East German agenda and the Russian
agenda may not be the same thing
You try to figure it out And act
accordingly try to make a deal --
Powers for Abel

DONOVAN
Well what about this college kid
Pryor

HOFFMAN

Don’t fall for that We can get him
out another time Powers is the
whole ballgame

The sedan pulls up to a remote looking house - a safe house

so cold in here you can see the men’s breath

DONOVAN
Where’s your room

He hands Donovan a slip of paper

HOFFMAN (CONTD)
This is a number here in West
Berlin Memorize it and give it
back to me

Donovan puts it in his shirt pocket

HOFFMAN (CONT’D)
No I mean now

Donovan sighs looks at the paper

HOFFMAN (CONTD)
The Soviets keep cutting
international lines but local calls
are okay Someone will pick up day

Donovan hands the piece of paper back Hoffman takes out a
lighter burns the paper and drops it into an ashtray

HOFFMAN (CONT’D)

rule of law is lessfirmly
established over there And
definitely stay away from the Wall
On their side there’s a line
cleared of buildings along the
Wall they call it the Death Line
Cross it and you’ll be shot

DONOVAN
Is there any outcome here where I’m
not either detained or shot

HOFFMAN
Don’t worry too much about what
Michener said

DONOVAN
No now I’m worried about what
youre saying This kid Pryor that

INSIDE A TRAIN

It is a gray day Donovan sits looking out His point-of-
view approaching the Wall It comes at us foreshortening
and then sweeps by a ragged line stretching into the
background punctuated by guard towers On its far side is a
swath of cleared land

Even beyond this Death Line many of the buildings of the East
are bombed out the war damage still largely unrepaired
There is not much life in the streets

Passengers disembarking Donovan among the last

A long line stretching up to a checkpoint Only one soldier
checks papers though many soldiers stand about

Donovan looks at his watch Tense
He thinks decides

He steps out of the line and marches to the front drawing
looks

Approaching the checkpoint the soldier checking papers look
up at him surprised This doesn’t happen

A couple soldiers tighten grips on their guns

Donovan holds out his passport and summons a degree of
sternness as in broken German he tries to explain his
plight The soldiers search his passport and wallet as he
points at his watch urgently

The soldiers search his documents and slowly all of them
begin to relax when they see he’s American They let him
pass

STREET

Donovan walking It is snowing heavily He reaches an
intersection Several youths are gathered there -- mangy
strays

They eye Donovan as they approach slowing
He eyes them not slowing

They pass but several paces on Donovan senses something
wrong He turns

One of them the biggest of the group speaks to him in
German

Clearly it is a question They all look at him awaiting an
answer

Donovan stares uncomprehending
The big guy repeats the question This time impatiently
He grabs Donovan’s coat by a lapel Examines the material
HEAD YOUTH

So We apologize If this

Donovan realizes they are demanding his coat He asks for
directions to Unter den Linden The Head Youth points out
the directions

DONOVAN
Do you understand English
RECEPTIONIST
Yes sir
DONOVAN

I’m James Donovan I’m here to meet
a Mr Vogel

RECEPTIONIST
Mr Vogel

DONOVAN
He doesn’t work here I’m just
supposed to meet him That’s all I
know

The receptionist is showing Donovan into

though a series of magnificent rooms to a parlor of sorts

There are three people in the room a woman in her fifties a
much younger woman and an older man in a three-piece suit

The older woman is effusively emotional and charges Donovan

weepily

WOMAN
Mr Donovan So we finally meet
you

She hugs him Donovan stiffly unresponsive

WOMAN (CONT’D)
I am Helen Abel How is our
husband How is Rudolf

DONOVAN
He’s good as can be expected --

HELEN
And we will get him back yes This
is our daughter Lydia

DONOVAN
How do you do (to the older man)
And you’re Mr Vogel

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 68

The man is momentarily thrown He recovers laughing
MAN
No no no no Not Vogel no I am

cousin Drews

HELEN
This is Rudolf’s beloved cousin
Drews

DONOVAN

Yes Cousin Drews

DREWS
I am Cousin Drews

DONOVAN
Cousin Drews yes

HELEN
I’m Helen Abel

An awkward pause

HELEN (CONTD)
When will you see him

She pulls him down to a small sofa

HELEN (CONT’D)
When will your government release
him

DONOVAN
I’m sorry I’m a littlelost here
I’m supposed to meet a Mr Vogel

LYDIA AND DREWS
Yes Mr Vogel is our lawyer

DONOVAN
Yes and I thought we were supposed
to negotiate the exchange

HELEN
To bring Rudolf here

DONOVAN

Well yesyes to bring him here

but it doesn’t happen unilaterally

Do you understand It has to be an

exchange

Helen bursts into tears

Lydia puts an arm around her to comfort her

Cousin Drews

kneels in front of the sobbing woman comforting her as well

Donovan dubiously watches this show

A door clicks open -- not the one Donovan entered by but one
set into a panel of the wall near the mirror behind the desk

A man enters

MAN
Mr Donovan

Donovan rises extending a hand

DONOVAN
Mr Vogel

Shaking hands his manner dry urbane

SCHISCHKIN

No no no My name is Schischkin
Ivan Schischkin I am second
secretary of the Soviet Embassy
would not be appropriate for Mr
Vogel to join us he is a German

national

DONOVAN
So you arehere to

SCHISCHKIN
To facilitate this meeting

group on the couch) Perhaps Mrs
Abel would like to compose herself
privately And let Mr Donovan and

myself to talk

The group takes the cue and leaves by the main door faces

suddenly stern
Now the room is quiet A beat

DONOVAN
So I’m confused

SCHISCHKIN
Yes

( )

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

DONOVAN
I don’t care who I talk to if it’s
about an exchange ofpersonnel
Are you the person to talk to

SCHISCHKIN
Yes yes -- of course we should talk
Please have a seat Sit down

They sit opposite one another at a small table

SCHISCHKIN (CONTD)
So how did you arrive in the
Eastern sector

DONOVAN
The train The S-Bahn
SCHISCHKIN
You were alone
DONOVAN
Yup
SCHISCHKIN

And you are credentialed --

DONOVAN
You must know about me sir I’ma
private citizen a lawyer in
Brooklyn -- in the United States --
and I’ve taken some time out of a
busy schedule to help my client
Rudolf Abel I’m authorized to
arrange an exchange of Abel for
Francis Gary Powers -- this is a
full pardon of Abel (handing a paper
across) that will be signed when the
exchange actually takes place
That’s the only reason I’m here I
hope and expect to make this

arrangement quickly -- Abel for

Francis Gary Powers (a measured

beat) and -- Frederic Pryor
SCHISCHKIN

We don’t have Pryor

DONOVAN
No You don’t

( )

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

SCHISCHKIN
I’ve heard of Pryor But he is held
by German Democratic Republic not
by the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics

Schischkin hands him back the pardon

DONOVAN
Well I’11 tell you the first
problem the names of your countries
are too long

Schischkin smiles

SCHISCHKIN
If we release Powers it is only to
promote good will between our
countries So it cannot be an
exchange Perhaps you could release
Abel as a token of good will to our
friends in Germany and then some
months later we would release
Powers there’s an idea

DONOVAN
No that won’t work for us at all
you see we need this to be an
exchange You can call it what you
want but an exchange it must be We
can have Abel within forty-eight
hours We need Powers at the same
time we give you Abel

SCHISCHKIN
Well this is -- can we call this
“The Impatient Plan”

DONOVAN
Call it whatever you want

Donovan’s cold’s getting worse He blows his nose

SCHISCHKIN
I can relay your Impatient Plan to
Moscow see what they say But they
will wonder why so Impatient

DONOVAN
Because I have a cold I don’t live
in Berlin and I want to get home

( )

Schischkin takes a moment to think

waits

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

SCHISCHKIN
They will think well the Americans
must have gotten all the information
that Abel had to give And now they
are now impatient to trade him
hoping to get in return this man
Powers who perhaps has not yet given
up the information that he has to
give This is not an equitable
trade sir

DONOVAN
But you’re saying if Powers has
given up everything he knows then
Moscow would trade Why wouldn’t
they As for Abel if he dies in an
American prison the next Russian
operative who gets caught might
think twice about keeping his mouth
shut(and now he tries something
new) and you never know Abel might
want to see the sky again and start
to trade Russian secrets for very
small American favors

SCHISCHKIN
How can we know this We little
men we just do our jobs

DONOVAN
Like Lt Powers He’s just a pilot

SCHISCHKIN

He was making photographs from
seventy thousand feet when he was
shot from the sky People in my
country consider this an act of war

DONOVAN
We have to get off this merry go
round sir The next mistake our
countries make could be the last
one We need to have the
conversation our governments can’t

SCHISCHKIN
I will ask Moscow Who knows what
they will say A lot of people Mr
Donovan don’t want this exchange to
ever take place

Donovan watches him and

( )

He rises

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

As does Donovan

SCHISCHKIN (CONTD)
Can you come back tomorrow and
discuss their answer Powers for
Abel

DONOVAN
And Frederic Pryor

SCHISCHKIN
(patient)
As I said Pryor is in the hands of
the organs of state security of the
German Democratic Republic

DONOVAN
I’m confident you can make
arrangements

SCHISCHKIN
I am merely a secretary in the
embassy of a foreign power

DONOVAN
Okay

SCHISCHKIN
Youll have to see Mr Vogel I’11
give you his address

Donovan looks at him for a beat

DONOVAN
There actually is a Mr Vogel
SCHISCHKIN
Why would you imagine otherwise
It’s a short cab ride (writing)

And please Mr Donovan wear an
overcoat in this weather

DONOVAN
I had mine stolen from me

SCHISCHKIN
What did you expect (handing him
the address) It was from Saks Fifth
Avenue Wasn’t it

On Donovan as this sinks in

Sorry about the embassy the Soviets

DONOVAN
Yes And interest in the

VOGEL
Yes a new world all very

Let me tell you what I have to

offer I ama good friend --

friend no he is older -- protégé --
of the Attorney General of the

German Democratic Republic Sit

down please

They sit across from each other at Vogel’s desk

VOGEL (CONTD)

This unfortunate Frederic Pryor
well he was in the wrong place at
the wrong time But every accident
properly viewed is an opportunity
isn’t it Mr Donovan

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 75

DONOVAN
Well --

VOGEL
Your country refuses to recognize
the German Democratic Republic
They prefer to make up stories --
that the GDR doesn’t exist for
instance

Donovan signals that his glass is empty

VOGEL (CONT’D)
Sorry

He rises to refill it

VOGEL (CONT’D)

As a means of forcing your
government’s recognition of this
real place sir in which you find
yourself -- the GDR The Attorney
General is happy to negotiate with
you as a representative of your
government for Mr Pryor’s return

DONOVAN
Mr Vogel I’m not here as a
representative of my government

Silent beat

VOGEL
(sadly)
All right I think that’s childish
Mr Donovan

Donovan shrugs

DONOVAN
Well I have no official status

VOGEL
Fine you do not represent the
USA I do not represent the GDR My
client is Lydia Abel Rudolf’s wife
and I have also --

DONOVAN
Lydia is the daughter Helen is the
wife

DONOVAN
Well let’s be clear We will
produce Rudolf Abel At the same
time you will produce the student
Pryor At the same time

VOGEL
Absolutely

Vogel takes a photograph from a file on his desk top The
photo is of an incarcerated Pryor looking very young and
very scared He hands it to Donovan

HOFFMAN
How did you lose your coat

You know Spy stuff

Hoffman gazes at him deadpan Finally

HOFFMAN
Ill get you another coat
DONOVAN
Good Good So -- who is this
Vogel
HOFFMAN

Him we don’t know He might be what
you said he is friend of the
Attorney General Just some guy the
GDR tapped to handle this Sounds
like the East Germans are fighting
for a place at our table The GDR
gets Abel back for the Russians
winning their respect and captures
the headlines for their cause

Which of course puts East Germany on
the map But we don’t care about
their map Stick with the Russians
Stick with the Russians It’s
Powers for Abel

DONOVAN
So does all this mean it might
actually -- happen

HOFFMAN

Schischkin gets the okay all that’s
left is the mechanics of the trade

DONOVAN
Our guys Two guys Powers and
Pryor

HOFFMAN

No Don’t go bleeding heart on me
Powers is the whole ballgame

Forget this Ivy League boy who
obviously thought it was a good idea
to study Soviet economics in Berlin
in the middle of the Cold War
Powers is who we need

SCHISCHKIN
So I have received a favorable

proposal that we help our friends in
the German Democratic Republic by
exchanging Mr Powers for Mr Abel

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

DONOVAN
That’s swell

SCHISCHKIN

as a place for the swap

DONOVAN
Why not Checkpoint Charlie

quiet Especially early morning

He raises his glass Donovan toasts him in Russian

The toast is interrupted by a knock

SECRETARY

A secretary puts his

A message for Mister Donovan

VOGEL’S OFFICE

The familiar squalid counterpoint to Schischkin’s Louis XIV

swank

( )
121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 83

Dapper Vogel in a new change as incongruously fine in this
office as was his last one But his manner is different not
at all the happy fixer of yesterday His tone is cold as
Donovan dabbing at his nose is shown in

VOGEL
There will be no exchange on
Glienicke Bridge

Vogel rises and reaches for some files he puts into his
briefcase

DONOVAN
Excuse me sir

VOGEL
There will be no exchange Not for
Frederic Pryor

DONOVAN
Mr Vogel I thought yesterday --
we agreed --

VOGEL
We agreed on an exchange Abel for
Pryor Now I learn you are a rug
merchant selling the same rug to two
customers Abel for Pryor you sell
to us Abel for Powers you sell to
the Soviets

Vogel’s secretary helps him on with his overcoat and scarf

DONOVAN
--I’m not sure I understand the
problem If the arrangement
satisfies two parties or three or
four what difference --

VOGEL
The arrangement does not satisfy
this party

He exits into the corridor and Donovan follows

DONOVAN
Now Mr Vogel please --

VOGEL
Obviously you do not know who you
are dealing with

(MORE )

( )

121714 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

VOGEL (CONTD)

Here is the interest of the German
Democratic Republic to deal with
and to be seen to be dealing with
another sovereign power the United
States An equal power Instead
you treat us as stooges for the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics

DONOVAN
Can we just call them “the Russians”
-- it’1ll save time

VOGEL
I have an appointment sir I think
it is you who are wasting time

He heads down the stairs Donovan follows

OUTSIDE

DONOVAN
Tell me if I’m describing this
wrong You have a kid a university
student somebody you know is not a
spy and no threat to you In
exchange for this person worthless
to you you play an equal part in an
exchange with two other powers the
Americans and the Russians

The two men emerge from the building

DONOVAN
It’s one transaction between us and
the two of you We’re not trying to
do two different things here It’s
one thing One one one And it’s
hard for me to see how the Republic
of East German Democrats is being
slighted

VOGEL
You arranged with the Soviets
without consulting me Is this a
negotiation -- or a conspiracy

DONOVAN
For it to be a conspiracy there
would have to be some harm to you
sir There’s just benefits here
We have agreeing interests --

Vogel is climbing into a fancy sports car parked at the curb

to the West (no answer) Our
Russian friends have decided that we
should not rebuild our capital city
We live in this ruin Made by our
Russian friends Go ahead make
your deal with these Russians but
we wont be part of it

DONOVAN
There is no deal without Pryor
We’re not leaving him here

The car rounds a corner at speed

VOGEL
Is that your position or your
governments

DONOVAN
Im here I’m talking to you

VOGEL

the government You don’t know who
you are Neither do we You should
be careful This is not Brooklyn

Donovan stands gazes out the window in horror

Four figures at the wall They are riddled with gunfire two
dangling and dropping to the eastern side the other two

Donovan rises

DONOVAN
And tell him this so far Abel has
been a good soldier But he thinks
he’s going home If we have to tell
him he’s not going home the Soviets

responsible for that (He chuckles)
That’s a long message Ya got it

Would it help

Murphy is apprehensive as they approach the midpoint

reacting to the quiet

The men stop just short of midway A waiting beat

Abel talks to Donovan to his side but his look remains
forward directed at the men approaching from the other side

of the bridge

ABEL (CONTD)
To answer your question my friend
I acted honorably I think they
know that But sometimes people
think wrong People are people
Well see how they greet me

DONOVAN
What can I look for

ABEL
If I’m embraced Or just shown the
backseat
Quiet Crisp footsteps approaching
The other party stops just short of midway
Total quiet

Floodlights burst on illuminating both sides

Schischkin steps forward projects a few words in Russian

toward Abel

Abel sets down his suitcase and takes off his hat and
glasses to be more easily identified He and Schischken

TRAIN

Subway the next day Donovan riding into work He sits by
the window as he did on the S-Bahn but now finally looks
like he’s had a good night’s sleep

Passengers on the train are reading their newspapers
headlines about the spy exchange One woman - the same woman
who once looked at him disapprovingly - looks below the fold
and sees a photo of Donovan Recognizes him sitting across
from her She smiles He is uncomfortable but then he
smiles too His look drifts to his window

His point-of-view Brooklyn sweeping by More benign than
was Berlin His peaceful expression darkens as the train
passes backyards where a group of kinds are climbing a fence
dropping to the other side The camera holds on the train
interior Donovan continuing to gaze out the window
