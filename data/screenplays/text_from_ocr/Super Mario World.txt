INT SELF REFLECTION - NIGHT
Where to start

Final Draft was a kind of light-bulb moment for me I was a
lonely frustrated teen I’d been writing novels and short
stories for a few years by the time I tried to write a movie
at age 16 The novels and short stories are unquestionably
dreadful and few have ever been touched by the eyes of
anyone but their author young stupid alienated excited
me

Creatures Series fan fiction Yes and starring myself of
course Starcraft fan fics Yes complete with an
amateurishly written “gritty” tone sex scenes and all 600
page novel about a failed alien invasion Yes yes yes I
thought I was a unique snowflake too even as typed the
words “space marine” Cliches felt inspired Tropes felt
like invention I really believed I was a genius

Dont worry Time has dispelled that delusion

Writing I’ve come to learn is a patience game Because you
do not start out as a good writer Or rather I did not
start out as a good writer and have never met anyone who
did In fact most people never even become good writers by
my standards because they don’t do it enough hone it again
and again they don’t have that enthusiasm that makes them
want to not just “sound smart” or “sound cool” but to engage
the reader and tell the fuck out of a story

You have to love the people listening even if you cant see
them You have to love them FOR listening for giving them
your time even if youre not there and theyre just looking
at paper or more likely these days a screen You have to
reward them You have to be good enough Its about them
not about you

Its almost exactly like a good conversation theyre
participating without talking Its almost exactly like sex
its this game of giving to give and not taking anything but
what you get by giving its telepathy writing and
storytelling are the-

Sorry Distracted Tangenting Super Mario

I became obsessed with Final Draft I’d write a movie a
month Sometimes a movie a week I refused to leave things
unfinished Id finish ideas I didnt even like I’d write
shorts I’d write TV episodes I had a disease I couldn’t
stop It was the most exciting thing I’d ever done

I didn’t feel smart the way writing makes some people feel
I didn’t feel like an artist nor did I specifically feel like
I was very creative But I did feel inspired Painfully
inspired Writing has always held a singular gift for me in
that when I’m in it hitting my stride the very ACT of
writing is entertaining

When I write it’s because I want to see the things in my
head I want to SHARE them What good is a story if you
don’t tell it I’ve never understood those people with
notebooks close to their chest filled with scribbles I’ve
never understood “enigmatic” writers It all feels like a
bunch of fluff to me fluff around a nervous kernel

Lets get to the point here I was 19 Super Mario World
Mushrooms and turtles Pipes and boxes Princesses and
plumbers

This script sucks

Even though reading through there are parts of it I enjoy
there’s some really inventive reinvention and mythologizing
some funny dialogue here and there the occasional burst of
REALLY cool action imagery

And yes to me the EPIC structure which feels more like a
Lord Of The Rings or Game Of Thrones than a Super Mario Game
works I was impressed looking back at how many times I
bring up a detail early only to repeatedly pay it off later
or trick the reader into thinking we’re going one way when
were actually headed in the opposite direction

That’s all good And that’s ALL that’s good There’s no way
to get around it

This Script Sucks

I believe it was the 29th feature I had tried to write but
don’t quote me on that I can’t be sure It has a very

unique set of problems and very few of the typical “early
writer” issues you often see in unproduced unsold scripts

Let’s see what we can learn right off the top by LOOKING AT
THE SCRIPT WITHOUT EVEN OPENING IT

1 - I’m writing a script about an existing property You
cannot sell those

2 - It’s 436 pages This is not a movie it’s a manifesto
There has never been a produced film in America with a length
of 436 pages

Let’s open it FLIP THROUGH WITHOUT READING and see what we
can pick up on a glance

3 - HUGE blocks of dialogue and action The mark-up in this
script is insane some of the chunks are so dense as to be
almost unreadable it’s like fucking House Of Leaves

4 - Did I just see some names of other Nintendo characters
only tangentially connected to Mario Are you fucking
insane Do you not know how rights work

Okay now let’s sit down and read it and then give some macro
notes

5 - Tone and pacing There are moments in it that work
throughout Everything else doesn’t It’s told in such a
languid way that nearly EVERY scene is too long there are
conversations and action sequences that go for over ten pages
in here

6 - Exposition Worldbuilding The commitment to
explaining retconning stapling and stitching together the
various barely-connected pieces of the incredibly thin “Super
Mario World Mythos” ventures past admirable into obsessive
The sheer amount of explaining EVERY aspect of EVERYTHING in
a TOTALLY RIDICULOUS WORLD is painful for me as a writer now
as some of you know I’ve become the type of guy to send kids
down into a cave and cut to THEY HAVE POWERS NOW without
explaining how or why I really appreciate knowing what’s
important to a story and what isn’t

It’s clear from this script that that’s something I learned
with time

7 - Dialogue A lot of it is just actually corny or bad
There’s a bright line or funny exchange here and there but a
tremendous amount of just out and out stupid stuff

8 - Action I write out ENTIRE FIGHT SCENES EVERY MOVE OF
ENTIRE FIGHT SCENES HEY DON’T DO THIS

9 - Characters There are just too fucking many Funky Kong
plays a major role in this movie For some reason I can’t
explain it was deeply important to 20 year old me to get
every single Super Mario character EVER at least a name drop
with people like Chet Rippo and Chuck Quizmo somehow earning
HUGE ROLES

10 - Songs I WRITE WHOLE SECTIONS OF SONGS INTO THE SCRIPT
Insane

11 - Stuff that happens There’s too fucking much I don’t
want to “spoil” anything but nearly every character has an
arc and an emotional pay off That’s likeA LOT That’s a

lot Trust me The final battle is nearly fifty pages long

12 - Coherency issues While one of the script’s biggest
strength’s is its almost George RR Martin-esque level of
“this pays off here that pays off there” epic scale plotting
(“if George RR Martin wrote shitty fan fic”) there are
still characters concepts and places introduced like the
reader should already know then

Looking back there is nothing to elevate this above fan
fiction In fact I’d say it’s actually far inferior to my
other relatively available fan-fiction work The Shocker
Legit which I actually wrote BEFORE Mario but shows much
defter characterization dialogue and storytelling

In all honesty I would love to play this script as an
Uncharted-style new grounded Mario Video-Game Id love to
see art of certain scenes But I can’t imagine literally
cannot imagine that any of you who so ambitiously venture
into this script will actually be able to finish it In
fact I question whether a lot of you even got through this
prologue without wandering off to check facebook twitter
your texts or even have just abandoned it entirely

Good Good for you This is an artifact It might be
cursed Save yourself while theres still time

Abandon all hope ye who enter here

My Super Mario World won’t ever really live up to its own
grandiose ambitions But then again Super Mario World was
never mine to begin with What Mario is I think is an
exploration It is at the most primal level a writer
exploring their own limits I wrote it not because I felt I
should but rather to see if I COULD

“They might be giants” said Don Quixote charging at
windmills

Im still charging at windmills But these days I try to
keep them under 120 pages

LIGHTNING FLASH
INTO
EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - THE WOODS - AFTERNOO
Caption - March 1988
The New Jersey Pine Barrens everything is gray brown and
green with Pine trees reaching up towards the sky Three

kids runs through the woods two grade school age and one a
little older maybe in Junior high

The youngest is a girl with flowing strawberry-blond hair and
large blue eyes Her name is Patricia but everyone calls
her PEACH She’s well out in front of the others laughing
and screaming

YOUNG PEACH
You guys are never gonna catch me

Peach runs off into a thicket and the two boys follow
panting tired The younger of them is WALLACE an angry
looking boy with ragged black hair and a pallid complexion
sweating from exhaustion He looks shady even at a young
age the sort of kid you’d catch stealing a Playboy froma
Seven Eleven

The eldest thirteen at the most has the same strawberry-

blond hair and blue eyes as Peach which is to be expected
she’s his younger sister This is CRAIG He’s bigger than
the two others round and red-faced

YOUNG WALLACE
(exhausted)
She’s too fast

YOUNG CRAIG
Maybe if we went around-
YOUNG WALLACE
(interrupting annoyed)
It’s all rocks over there Rocks
and broken beer bottles

YOUNG CRAIG
Well maybe-

YOUNG WALLACE
Give up Craig Peach’s just too
fast We gotta say uncle or she’s
gonna run us ragged all over the
woods

YOUNG CRAIG
Aw but-

YOUNG WALLACE
I say we just go back to the tree
house and wait Peach’1ll come back
soon enough she’s afraid of the
dark

YOUNG CRAIG
I don’t want to go to the tree
house It’s creepy

YOUNG WALLACE
(turns around and heads
off into the woods going
south)
That’s the point dork It’s to
scare away the losers

YOUNG CRAIG
(following)
We have to be home by six

YOUNG WALLACE
Whatever
(slowly patronizing)
We’11 go home once Peach comes
back

YOUNG CRAIG
Patricia You should call her
Patricia

YOUNG WALLACE
Whatever
YOUNG CRAIG
(breathing hard)

I don’t know why you’re
(takes a hit off his
inhaler)

So mean to her

YOUNG WALLACE
She gets on my nerves She’s got a
whiny voice you know You only
defend her cause she’s your sister
if you and her weren’t related
youd probably hate her too

EXT THE WOODS - TREE HOUSE - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Craig and Wallace approach a large ominous tree over a dark
dead thicket It’s a sort of massively over-grown briar-
patch all thorns and vines and stands easily six feet tall
covering a radius of maybe thirty feet

On several thick branches stretching out over the thicket
sits the afore mentioned tree-house a rickety little
structure of obviously amateur design Wallace begins
climbing up the tree to the tree house and Craig slowly
follows

WALLACE

(still railing against the

fairer sex)
Fact of the matter is girls aren’t
supposed to be allowed in tree
houses You can ask anyone girls
are supposed to play with barbies
and dress up and boys are supposed
to fight and build tree houses
it’s the way it’s meant to be And
just cause your little sister wants
to be a boy-

YOUNG CRAIG
Don’t
(takes in a gasping
breath)
Say that

YOUNG WALLACE
(looking down derisively
at Craig)
I’ll say what I want
INT TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

It’s a little kid’s tree house rather shoddily built with
lots of unnecessary nails and boards The roof is actually a
little impressive in that it functions because inside the
treehouse is almost completely pitch black

Wallace pulls himself up and inside and lights an electronic
lantern hanging from the ceiling The room is covered in

weathered crayon drawings and cut up “Dirk Drain-head” comic
book panels tacked to the walls

Craig starts to climb in but is exhausted from the effort of
climbing up the tree and can’t manage to pull himself through
the door

YOUNG CRAIG
(straining)
WallaceWallace help

YOUNG WALLACE
(rolling his eyes)
Jeez louise Craig Can’t you do
anything by yourself

YOUNG CRAIG
Please Wallace

Wallace groans and helps Craig up into the tree house Craig
goes over to a window (really more like a gaping hole in the
wall) Dark clouds have begun to cover the gray New Jersey
sky

YOUNG CRAIG
It looks like a storm is coming

YOUNG WALLACE
She’1ll be fine Craig freakin’
cool it okay

EXT THE WOODS - TREE HOUSE - DUSK

The sun is setting behind the dark clouds Wallace lays out
on a branch relaxing while Craig keeps watch for Peach from
the tree house There’s a clap of thunder and it begins to
rain Wallace laughs and dances around on the branch while
Craig looks increasingly concerned
EXT THE WOODS - TREE HOUSE - NIGHT

It’s raining heavily with the woods occasionally being lit
up by a crack of lightning

INT TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Wallace is sitting and playing Tetris on his Gameboy while
Craig sits by the window Craig spots something and taps
Wallace frantically on the arm

YOUNG CRAIG
(frantic)
Wallace Wallace

YOUNG WALLACE
Huh

YOUNG CRAIG
(points)
Look

Craig looks out the window an eerie light is moving through
the trees

YOUNG CRAIG
What do you think-

YOUNG WALLACE
(groans)
Finally
(shouts)
Peach

PEACH (FROM THE DARKNESS)
(down in the woods)
Wallace you jerk

Craig lets out a sigh of relief

YOUNG WALLACE
(looking at Craig
annoyed)
Well what the heck did you think it
was

EXT THE WOODS - TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Peach soaking wet and holding a flashlight reaches the tree
and begins ascending
There’s a strong gust of wind and for a moment the thick
layer of vines and brambles of the thicket seem to writhe
organically Peach notices and is suitably distressed
Craig appears at the door of the tree house to help her up

INT THE WOODS - TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Peach closes the rickety door of the tree house behind her as
the storm intensifies

YOUNG PEACH
You guys left me out there

YOUNG CRAIG
Well we thought you’d come back as
soon aS you Saw we weren’t chasing
you any more-

YOUNG PEACH
I got lost this place is like a
maze at night
(stops complaining for a
moment and goes over to
the window looking down
at the thicket below)
The whole woods getweird

YOUNG CRAIG
Stop it Patricia you’re being
creepy again
(looks at his watch)
Oh mom is gonna be so mad

The wind howls outside

YOUNG WALLACE
(showing some concern for
once)
It’s getting pretty bad out there
Are you cold Peach You can have
my jacket

YOUNG PEACH
(still testy)
I’m fine

YOUNG CRAIG
We should just suck it up and make
a run for home It’s only two
miles or so in a straight line we
could make it

The tree creaks and groans
YOUNG WALLACE
(looking around nervously)
Uh oh

Peach is transfixed by something outside the window

YOUNG CRAIG
Patricia What’s
(looks out the window)
Oh

Craig takes a panicked hit off of his inhaler

EXT THE WOODS - TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The thicket seems to be slithering apart revealing a vast
dark chasm just beneath the tree house Lightning cracks
through the sky and strikes at the base of the tree
shattering its trunk and causing it to lurch slowly down
towards the thicket

INT TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Peach screams and runs towards the door as the tree slowly
teeters while Craig remains frozen wide-eyed at the window
Just before Peach reaches the door Wallace shoves her out of
the way roughly and climbs out

EXT THE WOODS - TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The tree house goes crashing down into the thicket carrying
a good portion of the spooky tree with it just as Wallace
climbs out the door We smash cut to a black screen just
before impact

We hear a ghostly whisper of wind

CUT TO AN EERIE CLOSE UP ON AN ANCIENT “MISSING CHILDREN”
BULLETIN TACKED TO A TELEPHONE POLE

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - STREET - MORNING

The “Missing Children” Bulletin is easily 16 years old
probably the last one of its kind still up and it’s yellowed
and torn with age Its writing is faded and parts are
blurred or torn off but three spooky black and white
pictures are visible Peach Craig and Wallace MISSING
March 4 1988

Caption - January 2005

Crampton is a cold gray town with year round cold gray
weather It’s the sort of place that you drive through and
don’t notice just a gloomy little New England hamlet that
lost its way and ended up in New Jersey The streets are
wide and empty with black white and gray cars parked in the
drive ways of white houses with gray roofs There are no
gardens just dead grass

There’s a strong gust of wind and the “MISSING CHILDREN”
notice breaks free of its long ago rusted staple

We follow it a patch of yellow against the gray sky as it
blows down the street The houses get sparser and further
apart and we finally come to a faded peach colored house
sitting on the edge of the woods dark green and brown pine
trees looming over the red-tiled roof

The house is notable not only for it actually having colors
but also because next to it has a small green-house long ago
cracked and stained an icky brown The “MISSING CHILDREN”
flier floats towards the house

INT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - MARIO’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The place is a mess Everything in the house is stained
yellow and brown and maroon
empty soda bottles beer bottles potato chip bags pizza
boxes and other assorted junk cover almost all flat surfaces

A fat disheveled man early 30s with greasy skin greasy
hair and a greasy mustache lays over the covers of a long
unwashed bed wearing a filthy sleep shirt and boxers that
might’ve at one time been white

He snorts in his sleep and rolls over falling off the bed
He slowly awakens and then drags himself to the bathroom
This is MARIO Cassavettes

INT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Remember how disgusting the bedroom was Multiply it by six
and you have the bathroom Mario stands at the mirror and

looks at his yellowed teeth in the gray flickering light
His toothbrush has mold on it and a cobweb

He opens the mirror cabinet revealing shelves full of
prescription anti-depressants He pours himself a cup of
brownish water and retrieves a bunch of pills from their
bottles but then the “MISSING CHILDREN” flier suddenly slaps
up against the bathroom window (but blows away before he can
get a look at it) and startles him into dropping the pills
into the sink

He stares at them and then begins carefully lining them up
end to end color-coding (this being a none-too-subtle
reference to fan-favorite Nintendo game Dr Mario) He looks
at his newly formed grid and then very slowly pushes the

pills down the sink drain

He runs the water and watches them go He grunts and then
looks up into the mirror He looks awful

INT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - HALLWAY
Now dressed in stained gray overalls and a stained white

shirt Mario walks down the hallway headed for the kitchen
As he goes he passes several framed pictures

The first is of two kids one stout and one lanky standing
on a beach The caption underneath reads “MARIO and LUIGI 1987
DAYTONA” The next is a picture of the thin kid in his
teens he’s graduating high school And under that is a
picture of the fat kid wearing a Metallica T-shirt and a
plumber’s belt helping a man we assume to be his father to
fix a broken sink

After that is a funeral picture it’s the two boys now full
grown along with their mother One of them is Mario
The other man is a near to reverse image
and has a clean

(in a subtle way)
haircut he looks almost like a

INT VITRIOL AND SPEW PLUMBING

Mario sits at a long steel table with several other less
disgusting plumbers listening to a pudgy Japanese man PAUL
Spew who occasionally takes small bites out of his bagel-
burger Mario looks gone a million miles away a mostly
burnt out cigarette hanging off his lower lip

PAUL
(continuing his pre-scene
train of thought)
Yeah I saw her coming out of Stop

Aw better than that she’s a seven

Mario doesn’t respond he’s glassy eyed looking into the
distance

cigarette in an ash tray)
Yeah fine fine

eating his sandwich

“Who are you”

ESTABLISHING SHOT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - LATE AFTERNOON

Heineken he shuts the fridge and on the door is a list of
things to do 1 FIX GREENHOUSE ROOF 2 CLEAN HOUSE 3
GET HEDGEHOG OUT OF GARDEN 3 CALL LUIGI The list goes

then goes out into his yard

watch in fast
in front of him
woods moves

Mario sits and stares into the woods and we
motion as the empty Heineken bottles line up
until he’s entirely drunk Something in the

it seems like a vine drops off a tree by itself Mario
blinks a couple times and it’s gone but then he notices it
again on the forest floor slithering away

MARIO
(slowly drunk)
Now what

He belches drunk and confused and then goes into the house
There’s a silence and then he emerges staggering a little

holding a flashlight Mario clumsily climbs over the garden
fence and heads into the woods in pursuit of the autonomous

vine

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - THE WOODS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Mario stumbles through the woods mumbling to himself
Occasionally he needs to stop and look around with the
flashlight to find the vine as it slithers away but
generally he keeps a pretty good pace with it even in his
condition

Eventually he comes to a huge outcropping of rocks amongst
which lay the remains of shattered beer bottles The vine
slithers through the rocks and Mario desperate to keep up
scrambles along the top of the rocks

The rock tops are too steep and Mario slips plummeting
eight feet to the forest floor BAM cutting his arms up a
little on the beer bottles

MARIO
(rolling over groaning
pained)
Aah oooohh

As he rolls over sees the vine sitting right next to him
close up it appears to have some sort of cartoonish rose bud
at one end about the size and shape of a football bright
red with white polka-dots

It’s the most colorful thing we’ve seen so far and it almost
seems to glow against Mario’s pallid greasy skin Simple
green petals ring the bulb like a collar It slithers up to
him and prods at him tentatively

MARIO
(staring at the bulb in
the darkness)
What the hell

The bulb snaps apart revealing a moist fang filled mouth
This is a PIRANHA PLANT It lets out a low hiss

MARIO
HOLY-

The Piranha Plant snaps at him and he rolls out of the way
The Piranha Plant chomps at him again and catches him by the
leg It proceeds to swiftly and very roughly drag him
through the woods painfully smacking him against several
trees and rocks as it goes

EXT THE WOODS - TREE HOUSE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

The once gigantic tree-house tree has rotted with age after
its fall and now leans crippled over the thicket The
remains of the tree-house hang in between the branch and the
thicket held by a couple termite-bitten planks of wood

he vine which we now see is based in the big thicket drags
ario into the clearing

ario manages to reach into his back pocket and yank out a
tility knife which he stabs into the head of the Piranha
lant It screeches and lets him go

ves BH

Mario hurt scared and drunk out of his senses makes a
tripping sprint to the base of the tree and clumsily climbs
up it barely holding on He gets up to its highest still
standing branch breathing hard and looks down getting a
little dizzy

MARIO
(panting)
Oh manoh god

Mario looks down again and notices something very big (easily
the size of a Volkswagen Beetle) moving up towards him very
fast from the darkness of the thicket

It comes out into the light of the moon an ENORMOUS Piranha
plant and snaps at Mario nearly eating him whole He
throws himself out of the way of the bite loses his balance
drops off the side of the branch and plummets screaming
towards the dark chasm beneath the thicket

the tazer and he’s a little hunched over He looks
completely zoned out much in the same style Mario was during
lunch at Vitriol and Spew

Next to him is a woman in an orange dress with a big hound
dog on a bright red leash The hound dog is the same color
as her dress in fact it looks suspiciously like the dog
from Duck Hunt (the game originally released WITH Super Mario
Brothers on Nintendo)

The dog stares at him He stares at the dog The dog makes
a series of low grunting sounds like laughter it’s bizarre
and unsettling The subway grinds into the station

INT CASSAVETTES REAL ESTATE

It’s a fairly fancy office with a small reception desk (so
small the computer barely fits on it) and a row of cubicles
A petite blonde woman SAMUS wearing a red shirt and a
yellow skirt along with a green head-set sits behind the
desk Luigi now more frazzled than ever enters

SAMUS
Mr Cassavettes I was worried you
weren’t coming in-

LUIGI
(roughly heading towards
his office)
Well I’m here now Samus

SAMUS
(stumbling up after him
nearly yanking her own
head off with the headset-
cord)
You’ve got seventeen messages and
the water is out in your office-

LUIGI
(turns)
The water is still out

SAMUS
We called the plumber like you
asked but he said it was useless
he said we’re going to have to buy
a whole new sink rebuild the
system from the inside out

LUIGI
Oh for christsakes

SAMUS
(concerned)
Are you all right sir

LUIGI
I’m fine No calls

Luigi goes into his office

NT CASSAVETTES REAL ESTATE - LUIGI’S OFFICE

t’s a sparsely decorated office everything tastefully
adorned with mass produced art stark and jarring primary
colors with no flare or presence

Luigi sits at his desk staring off into the distance and
then turns noticing an odd running-water sound from his
bathroom He stares at the bathroom door and then pulls out
the bottom drawer of his desk where a green tool-box with a
blue handle sits looking distinctly out of place in the gray
and white of the office He sits there staring at it

TIME PASSES

Luigi sits on the floor of his bathroom having completely
disassembled and then reassembled the bottom of his sink He
tightens one last bolt and then stands up and tentatively
touches the silver water knob He turns it and the water
runs He allows himself a small smile and then the intercom
in his office flares up

SAMUS (ON INTERCOM)
Luigi you’ve got a-

LUIGI
(shouting back at the
intercom)
I said no calls

SAMUS (ON INTERCOM)
It’s your brother

Luigi’s eyes pop open wide

SAMUS (ON INTERCOM)
He says it’s urgent On line three-

LUIGI
(hurriedly)
Yes thank you Samus
(sits down at his desk and
then slowly picks up the
phone When he speaks it
is in the voice of a
little brother to his
elder)
Mario

LUIGI
Mario-

There’s a click as Mario hangs up Luigi takes the phone
away from his head and looks at it for a moment before
setting it down on the receiver

His eyes drift over to a picture of his family on the desk
mom dad and Luigi look happy Mario as usual looks
miserable Luigi sits thinking

INT LUIGI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Luigi lays on his couch looking a bit nervous He’s
fumbling through a phone book and finally finds what he’s
looking for “VITRIOL AND SPEW PLUMBING” He picks up his
phone and dials the number It rings a few times and then
Sammy picks it up

SAMMY (ON PHONE)
Vitriol Plumbing Sammy speaking

LUIGI

eating New York health food or
whatever

LUIGI
Aside from that did he do anything
weird Say anything

SAMMY (ON PHONE)
(after a pause)
He was whistling

Luigi stares at the miserable Mario picture on his cabinet
bewildered

LUIGI
(quietly)
Whistling
NT LUIGI’S APARTMENT - LATER
Luigi lays in bed staring at the ceiling He slowly looks

over at Daisy’s side of the bed and sighs He closes his
eyes and drifts off to sleep

NT LUIGI’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

Luigi is up and about getting dressed He’s neatly packed a
suit case on the bed all the same gray suits and maroon
ties Time passes and we see him make a call It rings a
couple times and then the answering machine picks up

DAISY (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Hi it’s Daisuko and this is my
cell
(sing-song)
Leave a message and I’11 call you
back

There’s a beep

LUIGI

Hey it’s Luigi I’m justI’m
Headed out of town maybe for a few
days so if you need me justI

message

(pause)
Please call me I’mThere’s
something up with my brother and
I’m really worried about him If
you reconsider if you want to see
me justplease just drive on
down to Crampton and see us okay

Luigi hangs up the phone and then beats it against his
forehead several times realizing how fumbling and awkward
nay suspicious his message came off

EXT NEW YORK - NEW JERSEY - THE PINE BARRENS

Luigi’s blue and green Honda makes the journey from Brooklyn
New York to Crampton New Jersey Luigi flips on the radio
and Katrina and the Waves’ hit “Walking On Sunshine” blasts
through the car at earsplitting volume He groans and
changes the channel

NEWSCASTER (ON RADIO)
This is reported to be the fourth
in a series of massive weapons buys
in the Middle East It would
appear that an as of yet
unidentified nation is gearing up
for war and the world is holding
its breath

NEWSCASTER 2 (ON RADIO)
That’s a scary thought Stanley
How does a military simply lose
twenty six tanks

NEWSCASTER (ON RADIO)
(laughs)
Well Pauline not everybody is
lucky enough to live in America

EXT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE

It’s nearly exactly the same as it was before with three
major differences 1 The greenhouse has been repaired and
2 The roof has been repaired 3 There’s a sign reading
“Cassavettes SCHOOL OF SELF DEFENSE - HAPKEIDO - CAPOERA -
JUDO - AMATEUR WRESTLING - HOURS 400 PM TO 800 PM MON-
THURS CALL 687-7666” Tuigi’s Honda pulls up in front
of the house and we see Luigi stare at the house simply not
comprehending

He pulls around into the driveway gets out of his car and
walks up the pathway to the house He knocks on the door and
waits he can hear people talking inside The door opens
revealing a smiling man in his early thirties

It’s not the Mario we remember he’s lost weight let his
hair grow out a little and cleaned up his mustache into a
neat small beard He no longer slumps in fact he looks
practically exploding with energy His skin has cleared up

he even has a bit of a tan His clothes are clean if a
little bit bizarre he wears a loose red shirt and blue
suspender-overalls of an indeterminate denim-like fabric
with the straps down so they hang by his knees

MARIO
(exuberant thrilled to
see his brother)
Luigi

LUIGI
(more a question than a
greeting)
Mario

Mario embraces Luigi the surviving Cassavettes are reunited
after over a year and a half and Luigi looks terrified

MARIO
(pulling away smiling)
How was the drive down

LUIGI
Mario
(tries to find words)
Mario you lookgreat

MARIO
(laughs leading him
inside)
You’re early I’m in the middle of
a class

LUIGI
(going in)
Class

INT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The living room is clean some would say suspiciously so It
almost looks like it hasn’t been lived in like a shop window
display Mario leads Luigi through it

LUIGI
The house is soclean

MARIO
Yeah I figured it was about time I
gave the place a once over

A little kid in a sweat-suit and a backwards red baseball cap
peers in through a door at the side of the room which leads
to the green house The kid is NESS

Behind him several other kids of varying ages are visible
all wearing work-out clothes

NESS
Sensei Do we have a break
MARIO
Yeah take five and then we’ll doa

wrap up
(Ness starts to close the
door but then Mario
calls him back)

Ness

NESS
Yeah

MARIO
Say hello to my brother Luigi the
best damn real estate broker in all
the world

NESS
(smiles)
Hey Luigi

LUIGI
Uh hi Ness

Ness goes back into the greenhouse

LUIGI
What was that

MARIO
(going into the kitchen)
He’s a student of mine

LUIGI
You’ reYou’re seriously teaching
karate classes now

MARIO
(laughs opening the
fridge)
Not karate I don’t know karate

Mario reaches into the fridge and pulls out a carton with a
small mushroom with green polka-dots drawn onto it with a
sharpie

MARIO
I teach hapkeido capoera judo
and I’m learning some jinjitsu
Mario takes a gulp from the carton

LUIGI
MarioIn high school you couldn’t
even do a push up I remember you
used to sit on the bench and cry
during gym

MARIO

(smiles and puts the

carton back into the

fridge)
One of the many reasons I dropped
out of high school Luigi But I’m
a college student now

(grins)
Funny how that works

LUIGI
What Really

MARIO
I’ve been taking classes at the
Blackwoods Community College Plus
I’ve been reading up on getting
degrees in agriculture practical
and electrical engineering and
Chinese philosophy

LUIGI
(slightly disbelieving)
Sounds like a very busy schedule

MARIO
Yeah well when I’m not there
(points over his shoulder
at nothing)
I’ve got a lot of free time on my
hands

LUIGI
When you’re not where

MARIO
(smirks)
You’1ll see
(starts towards the
greenhouse but then
stops)
Two fifty

LUIGI
What

MARIO
Two hundred and fifty That’s how
many I can do now if I push myself

LUIGI

(quietly)

YouTwo hundred and fifty push-

ups

MARIO

LUIGI

Mario-

MARIO

(assertive)

I told you just give me a couple
of minutes Go check out your
room I got you some things

LUIGI
Got me some things

MARIO

(smiles)

Some stuff to help you on your way

Mario goes into the greenhouse Luigi staring after him

nq

The room is immaculate

looks out into the woods

NT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - LUIGI’S ROOM

It’s clearly unchanged since Luigi

moved out to go to college the walls are covered with
posters “NIRVANA” “RUN-DMC” “FAITH NO MORE” His window

On the bed lay several items

Most prominent among them is a pair of black overalls and an
emerald green shirt all neatly folded

Luigi enters and looks around at his room still a little

shell-shocked He picks up the overalls and lets them unfold
to the ground He stares at them for a second and then sets
them down turning instead to the other items on the bed
Chief among them is a green cap front furrowed out so that
it prominently displays an “L” emblem

LUIGI
(setting down the cap and
sitting down on the bed
sorting through the other
items)
Hm

The items are as follows 1 A thick eucalyptus-esque brown
leaf 2 A pair of rough and tumble all-terrain boots 3
A vial containing what looks like a drop of mercury 4 A
wad of tin foil Luigi picks up the wad of tin foil and
hesitantly unwraps it inside is what looks like a stack of
small blue pancakes

MARIO
(appearing in the doorway)
Those’ re Mookie cookies

LUIGI
(turning)
Mookie cookies

MARIO
Yeah Try one they’re delicious

Luigi takes slowly takes a bite of a Mookie cookie and then
smiles

LUIGI
(swallowing)
What’s in this

MARIO
(shrugs as Luigi takes
another bite)
Hell if I know Peach made them
and she’s pretty secretive about
that sort of stuff

LUIGI
(swallowing and taking a
cockeyed look at Mario)
»Peach

MARIO
Yeah

LUIGI
(slowly)
-As in Patricia Patricia Kline

MARIO
(smiles)
Yes Luigi

LUIGI
As in little dead girl Patricia
Kline

Mario just laughs and walks down the hallway Luigi taking
another big bite of the cookie hurriedly follows

INT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Mario goes into his room just as Luigi exits

LUIGI
(stuffing the rest of the
cookie into his mouth)
Wait Mario wait

INT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - MARIO’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is entirely cleaned out no furniture no lights no
artLuigi walks in and Mario turns to him

LUIGI
Mario you
(notices the state of the
room)
MarioJesusWhere’s all your
stuff

MARIO
I moved out

There’s a pause as the brothers look at each other evenly

LUIGI
(very slowly)
Mario you’re scaring me

MARIO
(apologetic)
Right sorry I just
(thinks)
I really have no idea how to go
about saying what I’m about to say

Luigi waits
LUIGI
MarioAre you on drugs

Mario stares at Luigi for a moment and then cracks up

LUIGI
Are you
MARIO
(laughing)
No
LUIGI

It’s weird cause that’s the answer
I was hoping for but it actually
makes me even more nervous I’m
worried about you big brother you
seem sowell happy and suddenly
you’re so into living life and
learning and teaching taikwando
classes-

MARIO
Hapkeido

LUIGI

Whatever look bottom line is
What the hell is up with you Is
this a midlife crisis thing or-

MARIO

(slowly)
If you want to know what’s up with
me if you really want to know
then you’re going to have to trust
me

LUIGI
Trust you

MARIO
Completely You are going to have
to do everything I tell you no
matter how weird it might sound

LUIGI
(shrugs)
-All right okay I trust you

MARIO
You’ re sure

LUIGI
I’m sure

MARIO
Good First things first put on
the boots the overalls and the
shirt

LUIGI
(quickly)
No

INT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM

Luigi sits on the couch in his black overalls and green
shirt looking miserable Mario comes around from the
hallway

MARIO

(happy)
All right stand up and let me get
a look at you

Luigi stands

LUIGI
You want me to put on the hat too

MARIO
Yes please

Luigi puts on the hat And there he is the Luigi of Super
Mario Brothers lore

MARIO
(beaming)
You look great

LUIGI
I feel like an idiot

MARIO
Trust me brother you are styling
You got all that stuff I gave you

Luigi pats his pocket
MARIO (CONT’D)

Right Don’t touch that stuff
until I tell you to got it
LUIGI

I got it

You can take off the hat now

you want but once we get there try

MARIO

to keep it on

LUIGI
(taking hold of Mario’s
shoulder)

Mario Once we get WHERE

Mario stands there

if

clearly contemplating his words

MARIO
(slowly)
LuigiWhat if I told you I found
something What if I told you I

found something more important than
anything anyone has every found in
the history of man

LUIGI

Okay we’re back firmly planted in
Luigi-scaring territory now

MARIO
(sighs)

Sorry sorry

Oh by Booster’s Bottom

(notices his watch)

Come on if we’re late

they’1l1 get antsy

Mario heads out the back door

LUIGI
(half spoken half
mouthed)

Booster’s Bottom

EXT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - YARD

A path has been cut leading into the woods
Mario is already heading in

hiking trail

hat into his overalls pocket

Come on

MARIO
(yelling to Luigi)

hurry the schmeck up

it’s nearly

almost like a
Luigi tucks his

Luigi shakes his head and then runs after his brother

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Mario walks down the path pushing aside the occasional
branch and climbing over logs the brown-yellow fall leaves
crunching beneath his boots He and his brother stand out as
colors in a nearly entirely brown and yellow world Luigi
catches up to Mario and they walk together

MARIO
(matter of fact)
The only reason I ever found it was
because they’d grown nearly to the
edge of the woods

LUIGI
(struggling to keep up)
They who

MARIO
The plants

LUIGI
Huh

MARIO
Piranha plants

Luigi stares at him blankly

MARIO
(laughs)
Don’t worry about it Not yet
anyway I’ve trimmed them all
you’re in no danger

LUIGI
Danger

MARIO

(laughs again)
I said don’t worry about it didn’t
I

(smiles and keeps walking

through the wooded path)
Luigi have you ever heard of the
theory of alternate dimensions

LUIGI
Yeah you mean like that episode
of Star Trek where the alternate
evil versions of the crew come and
they’ve all got goatees
(Mario reacts)
Are you disappointed with me

MARIO
(giggles)
No sweat a year and a half ago I
didn’t even know that much
(climbs up on a vine
covered log)
The theory runs like this Our
reality is just one in an infinite
series of realities each one
unique Some people believe that
there is literally an alternate
world for anything and everything
that you can possibly think of
Like there’s a dimension where
instead of this log being here
(points down)
It’s a centimeter to the left And
then there’s another dimension
where it’s two centimeters to the
right Or three or four or four
point twoImagine in our
infinite universe all the
different possibilities earth
could be exactly as it is but
somewhere an alien has one extra
head Just an infinite slipsteam
of possibilities an infinite
unorganized and uncountable number
of realities

LUIGI
That’sA little on the
mindblowing side

MARIO
Yeah But it’s not the truth
LUIGI
The truth I thought this was a
theory
MARIO
(helping Luigi up and over
the log)

(MORE)

MARIO (contd)
Yeah it was But I’ve learned the
truth

LUIGI
(very carefully)
Is thisis this Scientology

MARIO
(chuckles)
No Luigi

LUIGI
Okay What’s the truth Mario

MARIO
There are only five realities

LUIGI
(slowly)
Oh is that right

MARIO
(heading further down the
path)
I’ve only been to two of the five
but I’m pretty certain there are
three more

LUIGI
(slowly now totally
convinced his brother has
gone mad)
And whereWhere are these
“realities” Mario

MARIO
(smiles realizing that
Luigi thinks he’s crazy
and points up ahead)
Well you’re standing in one of
them the entrance to the other one
is just over these rocks

They reach the Beer Bottles And Rocks clearing where Mario
first met the piranha plant and Mario quickly climbs up the
rocks while Luigi hesitantly follows

rock pile)

wanted to see the desert

alongside him and Mario
points down into the
treehouse clearing)
There it is Luigi

lectric lights have been strung up between the branches of

and somewhat impossibly) skips and hops down the rocks into
he clearing and Luigi follows

(nearly falling down the

rocks)
Mario what is this
MARIO
This is pipe two seven seven one
One of very very few surface pipes
from our world to theirs
(hops up onto the ledge of
the pipe)
Come on

Luigi walks over to his brother and peers down into the
pipe Mario helps him up onto the ledge

LUIGI
(humoring the crazy man)
Alright now what

MARIO
Jump

LUIGI
You want me to jump into the big
metal pipe

MARIO
Yes

LUIGI
(looks around)
Where are we I mean are we
trespassing or-

MARIO
(irked that Luigi hasn’t
jumped yet)
I bought all the property and I
have a fifteen foot high brick wall
topped with barbwire running the
perimeter

LUIGI
Bought the property Where’d you
get the money to-

MARIO
(flippant)
My dealings in the gold market have
made me a multi-millionaire

This shuts up Luigi for a moment

MARIO
(laughing and putting a
hand on Luigi’s shoulder)
Luigi Luigi stop it
(MORE)

MARIO (contd)
You’re thinking about this waaaaaay
too much especially when you’re
standing on the edge of all the
answers Just jump

Luigi sighs and jumps into the tube Nothing happens He
stands there looking up at Mario who frowns disgruntled

MARIO
You didn’t jump hard enough

LUIGI
Oh you’ve got to be freaking
kidding me
(climbs back up onto the
ledge)
I didn’t jump hard enough

MARIO
You really have to throw your
weight into it Jump again

LUIGI
(giving up)
You know what No I’m not going
to jump I’m tired of humoring
your insanity Mario I don’t know
what you did or what happened to
you to make you this way and don’t
get me wrong I’m happy for you
but refuse to go along with it
any longer You have LOST IT man
I mean hell Peach Kline She and
her brother died when we were in
grade school for godsake-

MARIO
They disappeared They didn’t die

LUIGI
Everyone knows that-

MARIO
(rolls his eyes)
Luigi-

LUIGI
No Mario you have to listen to me-

MARIO
(groans)
Luigi-

LUIGI
Mario you need help-

MARIO
Shut up

Mario shoves Luigi back into the pipe and he falls head
first There’s a suction sound a bunch of leaves fly up
from the pipe and Luigi is gone Mario laughs looks

around and then turns and does a backflip into the pipe

INT THE PIPES - CONTINUOUS

Luigi screaming goes rocketing through a series of green
pipes which blur rapidly into a sort of jello green mass

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE FIELD PIPE - CONTINUOUS

Luigi goes rocketing out of a big green pipe hits the
ground rolls several times and then lays still on his back
staring into a beautiful dark blue evening sky (the first
blue sky featured in the story) He coughs stunned

And then the single strangest thing Luigi has ever seen
comes into frame His name is TOAD and he is a MUSHROOM
PERSON His red mushroom head is covered in white spots
and he wears white pants and a blue vest He stands even
shorter than most Mushroom people three feet high

TOAD
Are you Luigi

Luigi stares at Toad and then Mario comes into frame and
helps Luigi up Luigi looks to his left endless rolling
green hills spotted with tall lush green and completely
alien trees Luigi looks to his right a sprawling Spanish
style mansion

Luigi looks directly ahead a short drop off and then
literally hundreds of bizarre creatures holding flowers
party streamers with pictures of him on them and billboards
reading “WELCOM LEUGEE” The crowd is composed primarily of
MUSHROOM PEOPLE but among them are FROGGIX MOLEMITES
WIGGLERS and NOMADIMICE Luigi’s eyes nearly bug out of
his head

TOAD
(shouting to the crowd)
ALL HAIL SUPER LUIGI

The crowd goes insane setting off fire works shouting with
joy waving their signs dancing singing just generally
having an Elvis reaction to a Real Estate agent from Jersey

LUIGI
(slowly turning to his
brother speaking ina
squeak)
MmMario

MARIO
(smiling clapping his
brother on the back)
Welcome to my world little
brother

Luigi passes out Black screen Hold and then

CUT TO LUIGI’S
SLEEPING FACE

INT THE VILLA DE MARIO - LUIGI’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Luigi’s eyes slowly open and he looks around The room is
all jungle colors rich greens and blues He lays on a bed
that looks too comfortable to be real giant poofy pillows
prop him up and a big thick comforter lays at his feet He
sits up slowly and his eyes scan the room

A little league bat hangs on a mantle over a fireplace and
under it sits several pictures Luigi and Mario as children
riding a Go-Kart Luigi and Mario as teens with Mario giving
Luigi a noogie and a picture of Luigi and Daisy taken from
across a diner table with Daisy giving Luigi bunny-ears
Luigi’s eyes continue around toOH GOD MUSHROOM PERSON POPS
OUT OF NOWHERE This fellow is named WOOSTER

WOOSTER
Hello

INT VILLA DE MARIO - FOYER

Mario is chatting with Toad and several other Mushroom people
when screams echo throughout the house

MARIO
(grinning)
Oh good Luigi’s up

INT VILLA DE MARIO - LUIGI’S BEDROOM

Luigi is hidden behind the bed screaming and pointing at
Wooster who has pressed himself against the wall next to the
door in terror

LUIGI
AAAAH

Mario enters smiling widely

MARIO

WOOSTER
(nervous he’s done
something wrong)
Super Luigi awoke and then

shoulder)

Wooster exits Luigi slowly stops screaming

MARIO

bed now The scary little man is

Luigi peers out

LUIGI
(a little hoarse)

MARIO
Wait stop let me guess
(imitating Luigi)
“What the hell was that”
LUIGI
Yeah and-

MARIO
(imitating Luigi)
“Where the hell am I”

LUIGI

MARIO
That was a very scared Mushroom
person and you-

LUIGI
Mushroom person

MARIO

Yeah Mushroom people are the
primary inhabitants of the Mushroom
ingdom

LUIGI
Mushroom Kingdom

MARIO
(matter of fact)
Yeah That’s where you are

MARIO LUIGI
The second reality I was STOP STOP STOP
talking about granted
technically the Mushroom
Kingdom is just a small part
of it but it’s easy to use
it as a blanket term-

LUIGI
(screaming)
STOP
MARIO
Sorry

I don’t

words)

s and nods at a large curtain at the far end of

LUIGI
(looking at the curtain)
No

MARIO
Open the curtains it’s ten AM you
were out all night The view will
be great

Luigi stares pensively at Mario

MARIO
You don’t believe me so open the
curtains

Luigi stares at Mario for a time and then backs up to the
curtain very quickly turns around and pulls it open At
first we only see Luigi’s reaction a completely blank face

as though

his brain just completely shut down

We pan around to see the scenic view of Mushroom City It’s

reminiscen
towers wit

t of an ancient Arabian city all smooth edges and
h onion spires dark blues soft reds mint greens

sunset oranges puckered lemon yellows The sky is bright

blue but
clouds muc

the sun looks smaller than in our world and the

Down in the streets dozens of shouting cart-salesmen hock

their ware

and BIRDOS There’s so much going on that your eyes can’t
focus on one thing for more than a second

INT LUIGI

LUIGI
(after a loooooc000ong
pause)
Mario
(his voice shaking)
What in god’s name is going on

MARIO
Let’s take a walk

’S APARTMENT

There’s a knock at the door and then silence

DAISY (OUTSIDE THE DOOR)
Luigi Luigi

Daisy opens the door with her key she looks sad

DAISY
(calling into the
apartment)
I just came to get some stuff

okay
She goes to the door of the bedroom

DAISY
Luigi I heard you were acting
weird at work and I thought I’d

Daisy takes out her cell phone which reads 1 New Voicemail

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - MUSHROOM CITY STREETS

Mario and Luigi walk down the dirt streets as the denizens of
the city go about their lives all around them occasionally
stopping to gawk at Luigi and Mario clearly celebrities in
their world Luigi still seems very much put out by all the
insanity around him

LUIGI
SoAfter you saved their world
the first time they built you the
house

MARIO
Yes

LUIGI
And then the second time they
built you the statue

MARIO
(nodding as they pass an
enormous somewhat
inaccurately Adonis-esque
statue of himself)

That’s right

LUIGI
And then you conquered the land of
the Bob-ombs

MARIO
Yeah
LUIGI
And crossed the great sea of
Muchunga to fight the creatures of
Dinosaur Island

MARIO
Right
LUIGI
And then you were married to the
princess
MARIO
Yes
LUIGI

Princess Patricia Kline Missing
from our world since 1988

MARIO
You got it

LUIGI
And she lives in the castle

MARIO
Yes

LUIGI
(pointing ahead)
That castle

We pan around to reveal a gigantic castle up ahead on a hill

in the center of the city It’s a modernized

elaborated

version of the castles from both the original Super Mario

Brothers and the variation in Super Mario 64

MARIO

(grins)
Yes

(laughs)
You make what I do here sound so
simple I mean I don’t just save
the world and protect the kingdom
I’ve been helping their culture
along too Just four months ago I
set up an organized police force
here in Mushroom city

LUIGI
You set up a police force

MARIO
Yeah it was easy once you get the
tenets of Peelian Reform into their
heads these people stick to them
(gestures at some Mushroom
people)
They’ re like sponges Luigi
totally open to new information
They’ re not flawless they’ve got
crime and murder and all that but
man for the most part I’m dealing
with a civilization of three foot
tall muffin-top Buddhas

LUIGI
(rubs his forehead)
Oy
MARIO
What
LUIGI

I’m sorry if I’m still a little
hesitant about the idea that for
the last year and a half my brother
has been playing some Shaka Zulu
cum Sir Lancelot by way of John
Wayne to an alternate dimension of
mushroom people

MARIO
(after a pause)
Shaka Zulu

LUIGI
Never mind I justWell first of
all I don’t see how you did it No
offense Mario but when you got
here you weren’t exactly prime
physical specimen and you’re
telling me you’ve fought dinosaurs
and-

MARIO
(raising a hand to silence
Luigi)
Here Watch this

Mario walks over to a fruitcart has a quick back and forth
with the owner and then lifts the cart above his head single
handedly Some mushroom people stop to applaud and cat-call
Luigi looks from the cart to Mario and back and then starts
to speak

LUIGI
How-
MARIO
(interrupting him)
Wait

Mario leaps up into the air soaring thirty feet up onto a
nearby balcony kicks off the railing into a twisting flip
over the street and lands neatly next to Luigi Luigi’s
mouth moves without sound what do you say to that

MARIO
The physics here favor us Humans
mean The whole reality is
tailored for human domination

nq

LUIGI
The gravity it must be that the
gravity is less or-

MARIO
Then how come they can’t jump like
me

LUIGI

nq

They’ re probably hyper dense or-

MARIO
(scooping a Mushroom
person up into his arms
who immediately gestures
to his friends to take a
picture)
Then how come I can pick them up so
easy
(smiles for the Mushroom
person’s picture and then
sets him down Luigi
murmurs something under
his breath)
See it’s no good You can’t
figure it out

Luigi mutters to himself thinking

MARIO
I’m telling you Luigi you’re
going to have to stop all that
logical thinking about the nature
of this reality around here it’s
only going to end up confusing you
Just hold on for the ride my man

(MORE)

MARIO (contd)
You haven’t even asked the big
question yet

LUIGI
The big question

MARIO

Yeah

(takes a low confidential

tone)
If this is a completely different
reality then how come they all
speak English How come they call
themselves “Mushrooms” Where the
hell did they get these words if
they’d never even seen humans
before 1988

LUIGI
(after a moment of
thought)
I thought you
(blinks baffled)
Yeah how do they all speak-

MARIO

(slapping him on the back

of the head)
Again with the logical thinking
They knew English way back in the
eighties when Peach and the King
got here

(laughs)
None of it makes any freakin’
sense

LUIGI
Wait “The King”

MARIO
Craig

Luigi motions for Mario to go on

MARIO
(annoyed)
Craig Kline Peach’s older brother
he was a grade ahead of us

LUIGI
(remembering)
TheThe asthma kid The fat
asthma kid He’s a king now
MARIO
Not just a king
Think Julius Caesar
Washington

Craig banished Bowser

Luigi

King Arthur

George
Before
this place

was practically fascist

LUIGI

were talking about

MARIO
Turtle dragon yeah

He sounds terrifying

disappears down the street

Strapple

MARIO
(taking the strapple)
Here
(he pulls out a pocket
knife and cuts the
strapple in half handing
Luigi half)
See

The strapple though it looks like a normal Granny Smith on
the outside is a strawberry on the inside Luigi blinks
and takes a bite

LUIGI
(chewing)
Does everything here taste this
good

MARIO
Pretty much yeah Except fire
flowers

LUIGI
Fire flowers

MARIO
Eh I’11 show you later

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - BRIDGE

Luigi and Mario are standing on a bridge over a canal
looking out over the water Luigi is finishing his strapple

LUIGI
Hey if Peach and her brother are
here where’s Wally

MARIO
(pretending not to have
heard)
Hm

LUIGI
Wally you know Wallace Pike My
best friend

Mario looks at Luigi and something like saddened concern a
shade of the “old” Mario flits across his face

LUIGI
OrOr did he never make it to
this place

MARIO
(quickly)
No he’s here he’s hereIt’s

just-

Toad the Mushroom Person comes racing up the road
interrupting Mario before he can finish

TOAD
(trying to get Mario’s
attention)
Super Mario Super Mario

LUIGI
(flabbergasted)
You have them call you “Super
Mario”

MARIO

(quietly)
Actually they started that one on
their own

(turns to Toad)
Toad this is Luigi Luigi this
is Toad he’s my go-to guy around
here You need anything and I
really mean anything Toad is the
guy who can get it for you

Toad smiles proudly

TOAD
I’m sorry about what happened
earlier
(bows to Luigi)
I’m honored to finally meet you
Super Luigi

LUIGI
(looks at Mario then back
at Toad)
Nice to meet you too”Toad”
Toad and Luigi stare at each other
emotions

MARIO
What’s up Toad

TOAD

feeling two very separate

The princess requests your
presence You and Super Luigi

both

LUIGI
(interjecting)

You can just call me “Luigi” or
“Mr Cassavettes” if you have to-

TOAD
(boggled)
Mustard Cassavettes

MARIO
(sighs)

Don’t worry about it Toad Did
the princess tell you what it was

about

TOAD

(glances at Luigi then

looks back at Mario)
It’s about “the problem”

MARIO
(slowly)
Oh

TOAD
(stern business-like)

It’s in Kong Country Kongaland

Lohorsa Basin

MARIO
How bad
TOAD
Bad
LUIGI
Mario what’s going on
MARIO
(quickly)

Nothing nobody don’t worry about

it
(MORE)

MARIO (contd)
(starts down the road with
Toad in tow)
Come on You’re going to meet
Peach

LUIGI
(quietly)
Your wife
(futilely calling after
Mario)
Mario

Luigi shakes his head and then gives chase nearly running
over a mushroom person who shouts indignantly Luigi
hurriedly apologizes and then is almost run over by a trade-
cart being pulled by a Dino-Rhino

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE KLINE CASTLE - COURTYARD

It’s an enormous gated courtyard in front of the grand
castle complete with a radiantly bright floral garden and a
draw-bridge Mario and Toad cross the courtyard talking
quietly

Luigi barely makes it in before the gates close trying to
keep up He passes some Mushroom gardeners who bow to him
and then rushes up to Toad and Mario

MARIO
(continuing a
conversation)
Thirty injured That’s insane

TOAD
Maybe ten dead maybe more the
message wasn’t clear

MARIO
It’s DK what do you expect
LUIGI
(catching up)
Mario
MARIO

Good I thought we lost you

LUIGI
Look just because I’m taking this
better than expected doesn’t mean
it’s okay to go rushing off like
that

(MORE)
LUIGI (contd)
I’m still very much standing on the
brink of a psychotic break so I’d
appreciate if you stayed close to
me at all times

MARIO
Sorry about that Hey imagine how
Peach and Craig felt when they got
here these people had never even
seen a human before Imagine
growing up in another dimension

LUIGI
Why didn’t they just go back to our
world

TOAD
They couldn’t figure out which pipe
to go through

LUIGI
(quietly)
I only saw one

MARIO

(laughs at Luigi’s

ignorance a sort of

“hooboy if only you

knew” chuckle)
There are pipes all over this
place the thing is once you get
in you’re basically in freefall

(slowly)
If you don’t know exactly how to
get where you’re going you’re
going to end up lost Very lost
I still don’t know even where half
of the pipes lead but I’ve done my
best make guide-paths to all the
useful ones

LUIGI
How

MARIO
Paint Once you start using the
pipes more often you’ll see

LUIGI
(stopping)
You make it sound like I’m going to
stay

Mario laughs blithel
over the drawbridge

y and he and Toad go into the castle

LUIGI

(shouting after them as he
gives chase)
I’m not staying here

royalty

The basic architecture is a much larger (but exact) replica
of the entrance to the castle in Super Mario 64 Mushroom

people scurry from place to place busy and Luigi in his

efforts to keep pace repeatedly has near-collisions

TOAD
They said they were using
thosethings again

MARIO
Of course they were You think
he’d let his guys go in without
them Against Kongs He’s smarter
than that more ruthless This
isn’t Bowser we’re talking about
At least Bowser has morals

TOAD
(reluctantly)
Sort of

Mario and Toad start up a grand staircase

MARIO
(ignoring Luigi)
Anyone we know bite it

TOAD
There’s a chance that Diddy is
among the wounded

MARIO
(saddened)
Damn DK’s all right

PEACH
(appearing at the top of
the steps)
They wish they could hurt him
(notices Luigi)
OHMIGODLUIGI

PEACH Kline 32 leaps off the top of the stairs and floats
thirty feet down to Luigi whom she promptly embraces She’s
beautiful She’s glorious Put lightly Patricia Kline-
Cassavettes is a knock-out The long straight strawberry
blond hair has grown down to her waist and is held back by
an enormous tiaracrown speckled with jewels that accent her
big blue eyes

She has near to perfect skin marred by a “bear claw” scar
that runs up the right side of her face something big and
mean took a swipe at her It doesn’t hurt her beauty if
anything it accentuates her petite perfect features

Growing up in the Mushroom kingdom she’s never had to adapt
or “grow-up” (though she is relatively mature) Thusly all
of her mannerisms facial expressions and slang are that of a
10 year old girl

She wears an enormous sunset-pink dressgown that somehow
flows easily with every move she makes The mushroom people
closest to Peach and Luigi fall into bows Peach pulls away
from Luigi and looks at him beaming

PEACH
It’s me It’s Peach

LUIGI
(a little in shock)
I knowI haven’t seen you since-

PEACH
(amped)
Ohmigod BRAD STEVENS’ BIRTHDAY
PARTY

LUIGI
(a little tweaked)
You remember that

PEACH
Duh That was the day before I
ended up here I remember every
minute

While Luigi and Peach talk at the bottom of the stairs Mario
continues talking to Toad quieter now

MARIO
Any word if they’re still on the
scene

TOAD

We don’t know Bowser sent ina
squad they’ve been guarding the
gate pipe not letting anyone
through

MARIO
(groans)
Great

Mario thinks for a moment watching his brother talk to the
princess

MARIO
You think I should take Luigi

TOAD
You want my honest opinion

MARIO
Always

It’s becoming more and more apparent that Toad isn’t just
some sort of lacky He clearly has a great deal of respect
for Mario but there’s something else here this is a
warrior

TOAD
Well if his goons are hanging
around after the fact you’re going
to need back-up Especially if DK
is having one of hisfits

MARIO
(after a pause thinking)
I don’t think Luigi’s even ever
been in a fist fight

TOAD
He’s still better then a hundred of
us

Mario chuckles and Toad smirks This is some kind of inside
joke

MARIO
Right Go tell General Harhall to
put up a guard around the city’s
gates Call back as much of the
army as you possibly can tell them
it comes directly from me

TOAD
Understood

Toad sprints off purposefully Back down with Luigi and
Peach

LUIGI
So what then they just elected
you Princess

PEACH
Well technically I should be
queen but at the time the position
didn’t really appeal to me yah
know

LUIGI
But-

Mario shouts down to them from the top of the stairs

MARIO
Peach Luigi’s gotta go

LUIGI
Go Go where

MARIO
(turning and heading
further into the castle
calling out over his
shoulder)
Gear up sonny boy we’re going to
paradise

Peach giggles and follows after Mario and Luigi sighs
throws up his arms and follows

LUIGI
Peach wait-
(about the pipes)
Did you guysbuild all this

PEACH
No silly we found it like this
We built the castle on top of it
Of course we were just kids we
stayed away from the pipes mostly
you’d never know where they were
going to pick you up or drop you
off Mushroom folk can’t use them
something about the air in there
breaks them apart

LUIGI
SoWho built all this

Oh I don’t think anyone “built

always been here the pipes are
interwoven into every part of this

labelled the pipes

PEACH
Your brother silly

LUIGI
But you said no one knows where
they go-

PEACH
Well every day for his second
couple of months here he’d dive
into a different tube at random
Then he’d make his way back
recording everything he saw

LUIGI
(very quietly)
Wow

PEACH
They call him “Super” Mario for a
reason

Up ahead Mario stops next large pipe marked “473 KONGALAND -
LOHORSA BASIN”

MARIO
Luigi up there

Luigi looks up trying to figure out how to get the twenty
feet up to the edge of the pipe

PEACH
Mario be careful

MARIO
(quiet tender)
I always am
She kisses him on the nose

PEACH
Be back soon

Peach rushes off to dosomething Mario turns to Luigi
who’s trying to pull himself up the side of the pipe
MARIO

(stopping him quietly)
Stop it stop that you’re
embarrassing me

(looks around)
I wanted to wait a while before I
taught you this but I guess now is
as good a time as ever

(sighs)
Bend your knees

LUIGI
What Why

MARIO
Just do what I say okay We’re in
a hurry Lives may be on the line

LUIGI
Lives
MARIO
(grunts)

Bend your knees

(Luigi bends)
Now focus on the ledge of the pipe
see yourself standing there

LUIGI
(focusing)
All right

MARIO
Now jump

LUIGI
Jump

MARIO

Yes Jump

(Luigi starts to speak)
Look before you say anything let
me tell you As a human your
greatest asset in this dimension is
your ability to jump insane
distances Half of the dangers of
this world can be conquered by
planting a dropkick in their
forehead If you’re going to
survive in this world you’re gonna
need to be a master jumper

LUIGI
Right
MARIO
So jump
LUIGI
(very quietly)
Right

Luigi jumps just like Mario Luigi floats up into the air as
though gravity doesn’t effect him He overshoots the ledge
and almost falls in but grabs the edge at the last second
and pulls himself up Mario who’s jumped up looks at him

MARIO
Why would you bother getting back
out It was a good jump

LUIGI
(peering down into the
dark pipe)
I’m just not sure how comfortable I
feel just jumping in there

MARIO
(looking around)
What was that

LUIGI
Huh
MARIO
Did you hear something
(a pause)

Oh never mind it must just be
your teeth chattering in sheer
unbridled terror
(laughs and Luigi grins
embarrassed)
Come on just jump It’1ll be fine
I promise

LUIGI
-How far is the fall

MARIO
It’s not a fall the pipes aren’t
an actual physical realm They’re
more like a subspace transit-
system It’1ll feel like maybe ten
seconds
Luigi just stares at him

MARIO (CONT’D)
Do I have to push you again

LUIGI

No I got it I got it

MARIO

Just close your eyes and jump

and stands
After a long pause Mario

Luigi closes his eyes

and there’s a blur of

ipe and lands face first in
t of a large angry looking
He stares up at it This

t exactly good at thinking
more constipation than
ts to stand up and the

Goomba stomps a big foot down onto his back holding him

down
GOOMBA
Who’ re you
LUIGI
(squished)
Can’tbreathe
GOOMBA
What
LUIGI
Can’t breathe
(gasps)

Can’t breathe

MARIO (0OS)
Well then push him off

Luigi looks up

your foot too heavy

to see Mario standing nearby

GOOMBA
(to Mario)
Hey you look just like Mario

MARIO
(ignoring him)
If his foot is too heavy you
should push him off

GOOMBA
I swears you look just like him
You got the hat and the pants and
the little beard It’s
incredible

Luigi puts his hands under the foot and shoves the Goomba
off an act that looks physically impossible The Goomba
stumbles back

LUIGI
(standing looking at his
hands)
How did IHow could I
GOOMBA
Hey000-
(thinks)

You pushed me
(bares row after row of
insanely sharp teeth and
suddenly he isn’t so
funny anymore)

That makes me want to kill you

Luigi stumbles back raising his hands

LUIGI
NoNo

The Goomba charges headlong and Luigi turns to run but then
Mario flips in front of him and hits the Goomba with an
uppercut that sends it flying up into the air over the edge
of the clearing and into the jungle We hear a wet splat
Luigi turns to Mario

LUIGI
(a bit shaken)
That was a”Goomba” right

MARIO
Right They’re big strong dumb
as a brick and mean as hell The
life blood of the Koopa troop
(MORE)

MARIO (contd)
Throw some weight down on the top
of their heads and they pop like a
water-balloon

LUIGI
Didn’t take you long to take care
of him

MARIO

Yeah well you live you learn
I’ve got more scars from those
morons than

Mario notices a box roughly the size of a television set
floating in the air several yards away

MARIO
(grins thrilled)
Oh happy-day

LUIGI
What’s that

MARIO
(still smiling)
It’s a box

Aside from the fact that it’s floating a dozen feet in the
air the box itself is unremarkable it looks to be made of
plaster or clay jointed at the edges with metal paneling

LUIGI
I see that it’s a box Mario I
mean-

MARIO

You mean what’s it doing floating
in the air

LUIGI
Yeah

MARIO
(flippant)
I don’t know They’re all over the
place just sort of hovering
around They’re filled with all
sorts of useful stuff

LUIGI
Howd they get there

MARIO
According to the Mushroom people
they’ve been around since forever
It was Peach who figured out how to
open them

Mario bounces head-first into the underside of the box
hitting it with his shoulders in the manner that a person
would break-down a door The top of the box pops open anda
large feather pops out before floating down to them Mario
plucks it out of the air

LUIGI
Is that a feather
MARIO
No it’s a cape
LUIGI
A cape
MARIO

(tucking it into his
overalls pocket)
Yeah

LUIGI
It’s a cape

MARIO
Yes It makes you fly

There’s a long pause

LUIGI
I’m just going to stop asking
questions for a little while

MARIO
(laughs)
Good luck

Mario jogs up out of the crater the pipe sits in and helps
Luigi up too giving them an incredible scenic view of
Kongaland

LUIGI
(looks around)
ManLook at this place

MARIO
Yeah
(laughs)
Welcome to Kong Country

Luigi looks around the pipe is at the top of a rocky
outcropping which sits atop the entirely flat plateau of a
small mountain that rises above a palm canopy so thick that
you can’t see through it

The jungle seems to go on for hundreds of miles in every
direction and the wind blows the fronds like waves on the
ocean revealing thousands of dark beautiful wonders
beneath Strange exotic flowers sprout in the ground around
them lining a cleared path down into the jungle The sun
abnormally huge in the sky shines down on them around
perfectly rounded cumulous clouds

LUIGI
(quietly)
It’s beautiful

MARIO
(walking up beside him)
Yeah

LUIGI
(sniffs)
Hey what’s that
(turns and Mario follows
suit)
Smell

Down in the jungle to the south there is a patch of
scorched smoldering earth at least a mile wide

narrow genuinely angry)

There’s a honk and Daisy snaps out of her reverie noticing
that the light has turned green She starts driving and the
police radio blares to life

DAISY
Mario Cassavettes He’s out in
Crampton

ARNIE (ON POLICE RADIO)
Cassavettes like Luigi

DAISY
(quietly)
Yes

There’s a moment of silence

ARNIE (ON POLICE RADIO)
Is this an investigation

DAISY
What No why

ARNIE (ON POLICE RADIO)
Well I just ran the name
andwellMaybe you should come
down here and take a look at this

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - JUNGLE TRAIL

Mario and Luigi make their way through the lush green jungle
path occasionally having to shove branches vines and palm
fronds out of the way Luigi struggles to keep up as Mario
quickly walks through the jungle

Their conversation is rough and tense

LUIGI
I don’t understand

MARIO
You heard me

LUIGI
But I thought you said Wallace
wasn’t here

MARIO
I never said that

LUIGI
Butwhy didn’t he just make
himself a king like Craig

MARIO
Oh he tried But he didn’t go
about it the same way Craig did

FLASH TO

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM 1988 - FIELD

It’s stylized dark and dire Young Wallace strikes down
several Mushroom people and then raises an elder by the
throat

MARIO (VO)
Not everyone can adjust to suddenly
having so much power

Wallace has chained mushroom people and has them building
the enormous castle over the pipes that now form the pipe
room which at the time sit in a rocky valley

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - THE JUNGLE
They continue on through the jungle

LUIGI
Where were Peach and Craig Why
didn’t they stop him

MARIO
Things wereComplicated

SMASH CUT TO
DARKWORLD -
INSIDE VOLCANO

Everything is bathed in red light the cavernous innards of a
surreally curved volcano

Up on a rocky parapet Young Craig struggles with a giant
scaly snarling monster (it’s BOWSER though we don’t get a
good look at himyet) Craig is badly bloodied from claw
wounds all over his face (and through his clothes on several
points on his body) but is throwing punches for all he’s
worth Bowser knocks Young Craig down next to the edge of
the rocks and advances on him as though to push him over

For a moment Bowser looms over Young Craig his massive
shadow covering him in darkness and then Young Peach leaps
up from behind Bowser and puts him in a sleeper hold riding
on his back

Bowser stumbles back swiping around his arms desperately
trying to get the little girl off of him His spiked tail
whips up and the hooked tip brutally strikes the side of her
face(giving her the scar we saw earlier)

BACK TO THE
JUNGLES

(same)

LUIGI
(frowns after a pause)
So what happened

MARIO
Remember Toad

CUT TO 1988 -
THE PIPE ROOM

An obviously younger Toad scampers in beleaguered and
covered in cuts and scratches Young Wallace stomps in
behind him predatory dangerous he now wears blue overalls
and a white shirt clearly a precursor to Mario’s uniform

YOUNG WALLACE
(furious touching a cut
on the side of his face)
Get back here goddamnit

YOUNG TOAD
Catch me if you can jerk

Toad runs through the rows of pipes and Wallace leaps after
him soaring through the air this chase isn’t going to last
long And thenToad is gone Young Wallace notices and
looks around

YOUNG WALLACE
Where’d you go runt
(looks around running
from place to place)
You can’t hide from me for long
I’m going to find you and I’m going
to twist your freakin’ head off

We pan around Young Wallace as he searches and we move past
Toad breathing hard pressed against the side of a pipe
holding a baby piranha plant by the stem Young Wallace
appears next to him and throws a backhand which Toad ducks
His fist puts a dent in the pipe so big a person could crawl
inside

Toad takes off in a sprint up a set of makeshift stairs to

the edge of one of the taller red pipes He stands there

panting when suddenly Young Wallace bounces up next to him
and grabs him by the shoulder

YOUNG WALLACE
Got ya

Toad turns and throws the baby piranha plant into Young
Wallace’s face and it clamps on Young Wallace stumbles
around screaming and swiping at the plant and then tumbles
into the red pipe vanishing into the darkness

BACK TO THE
JUNGLES

The brothers walk in silence

LUIGI
(motioning for Mario to
continue)
And then

MARIO
And then he wasn’t heard from for
fifteen years

LUIGI
Mario I-

MARIO
(as they exit the jungles
into a clearing)
Shh

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - KONGTOPIA GATES

It’s a gigantic bamboo gate topped with a large crude
statue of a gorilla A primitive watchtower sits a couple
dozen feet out from the gate and around it are stacked huge
piles of wooden barrels which appear to be filled with
bananas andor giant gold coins

The bamboostone wall that the gate is attached to disappears
into the jungle at either side and just beyond the gate
itself is the burntdestroyed area of jungle The gate is
riddled with bullet holes and scorch marks and the gorilla
statue has been decapitated its head resting on its
shoulder

The gate is currently surrounded by Goombas and KOOPAS

LUIGI
(quietly)
CripesWhat are those things with
the Goombas

MARIO
Koopas Bigger than Goombas
meaner and a little bit smarter
If Goombas are infantry then
Koopas are the marines

LUIGI
So are they dangerous

MARIO
(makes an “ehhhhhhh” face)
Wel1111111111To mushroom people
Very To us No Not if you know
how to handle them

LUIGI
How do you “handle” them then

Mario grins and starts walking out of the jungle Luigi
after a moment’s hesitation follows

The GOOMBA SERGEANT takes notice of them and lumbers over

GOOMBA SERGEANT
(lurching at Mario)
This area has been declared off-
limits by the Koopa Troop

MARIO
I don’t know if you missed the
memo Sergeant but I’m not in The
Koopa Troop

GOOMBA SERGEANT
The jungles of Konga Land are a War
Zone Even if we could let you in
there you wouldn’t get out alive

A Koopa takes notice of Luigi

KOOPA TROOPA 1
Hey who’s that guy Sarge

GOOMBA SERGEANT
(noticing Luigi)
Yeah who’s that guy

MARIO
He’s an associate of mine

The Koopas and Goombas begin to fan out getting ready to
encircle Mario and Luigi

GOOMBA SERGEANT
I’m thinking I’m going to have to
take you in foruh

KOOPA TROOPA 1
(volunteers)
Questioning

GOOMBA SERGEANT
Yeah questioning

MARIO
(narrowing his eyes)
Sergeant don’t be stupid I
didn’t come here for a fight Just
open the gates and-

GOOMBA SERGEANT
He’s resisting

The sergeant roars and charges his dangerous fang-filled maw
open wide and Mario flips up into the air

LUIGI
(scared as the sergeant
charges towards him)
Mario

Mario comes stomping down directly on top of the sergeant
planting his feet into the top of the sergeant’s domed head
The sergeant explodes into bright blue goop like a water
balloon spraying Luigi

LUIGI
(wiping some of the gluck
off of his face)
Ew

KOOPA TROOPA 1
He sploded the sarge Get him

One of the Koopas grabs hold of Luigi from behind and roars

at him Luigi screams and then the gates into Kongville go

flying off their hinges The Koopa that has a hold on Luigi
yelps

KOOPA TROOPA 2
(eyes wide terrified)
It’s him It’s him It’s Donke-

An enormous gnarled fist flies in from the wreckage of the
gates and nails the Koopa in the side shattering its shell
and exploding its body into purple dust The owner of the
fist comes into sightIt’s DONKEY KONG

MARIO
Here we go

He lets loose with a terrifying primal roar at Luigi and
swings down a huge fist which Luigi barely dodges

Mario flips over to Luigi grabs him under the arms and they
both dive into the underbrush Luigi pops up but Mario
pulls him back down

MARIO
It’s best to stay low for this
part

Donkey Kong goes through the Goombas and Koopas like bowling
pins smashing them and flinging them in all directions He
picks up one of the barrels and hurls it like a shotput it
smashes into one of the Goombas who in turn explodes into a
shower of blue glop

KOOPA TROOPA 1
Retreat Retreat

The Koopa Troopas scatter into the jungle Mario slowly
stands up out of the underbrush and drags Luigi out with
him

MARIO
Now we’re on the hard part

LUIGI
What is that thing

MARIO
(slowly with
indeterminate emotion)
His name is Donkey Kong

LUIGI
(wiping some of the Goomba-
goop out of his eyes)
Is thatis it wearing a tie

DONKEY KONG
(notices them and slaps
his hands on the ground
sending out shock-waves
that flatten the trees
around him)
RAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRHHH

MARIO
(whispering)
I put the tie on him a couple of
months back he still can’t figure
out how to take it off I think
he’s started to like it

Donkey Kong begins a loping charge on all fours screaming
out a roar that shakes the jungle

MARIO
Here we go Stand your ground

LUIGI
(shakily standing his
ground next to Mario)
Are you sure this is a good idea

Donkey Kong now less than a dozen feet away winds up for a
huge punch

MARIO
(smiles turning to Luigi)
Sure no problem

Donkey Kong nails Mario with the big punch a fist the size
of a washing-machine connecting with his face sending him
soaring out of sight The giant ape looms enormous over
Luigi easily twelve feet tall

LUIGI
AhHah

Donkey Kong roars directly into Luigi’s face blowing off his
hat and then swings in his hands to clap Luigi between them
Luigi ducks under the clap and scurries through Donkey Kong’s
legs

Donkey Kong confused looks around Luigi takes this
opportunity to pick up a big radish sticking out of the
ground and hurl the fat hard vegetable into the back of
Donkey Kong’s head Donkey Kong stumbles and then turns on
Luigi looking very pissed

DONKEY KONG
(rubbing his head)
StupidHuman

LUIGI
You can talk
(laughs nervously)
Good good you can talk We can
talk-

DONKEY KONG
EatStupidHuman

LUIGI
(quietly)
Eat

Donkey Kong slowly starts advancing on him
LUIGI

I swear that radish thing it was
on impulse I didn’t mean anything

by it
DONKEY KONG
Eat
(points at Luigi)
You
LUIGI
(whimpers)

I’m not food

Donkey Kong charges roaring saliva flying in all
directions when suddenly Mario a yellow cape on his back
swoops down from the sky and hits Donkey Kong like a missile

LUIGI
(in a tiny amazed voice)
Mario

Donkey Kong swats Mario away with a vicious back hand
sending him soaring into the air but he flies right back
into DK’s neck and slams his face into the bamboo-wall by a
pile of barrels Mario floats down next to Luigi as DK
recovers

LUIGI
(slowly)
MarioYou’reFlying

MARIO
(excited enjoying
himself)
Yeah I told you it’s the cape

LUIGI
But how can you-

MARIO
(pointing off-screen)
Heads up

LUIGI
(turning a second too
late)

Huh

Donkey Kong recovered hurls a barrel directly into Luigi

It shatters on impact and knocks Luigi flat on his back
Mario ducks and dodges through a hail of barrels using his
cape like a matador and finally reaches Donkey Kong hits

him with an uppercut that carries him up above the tree tops
and then kicks Donkey Kong back down to the ground out of mid-
air

Donkey Kong recovers and stumbles up looking around and
then starts heading into the jungle as Luigi slowly gets to
his feet

LUIGI
(weak)
That must’ve weighed a hundred
poundsI should be dead I should
be-

MARIO
Luigi grab him

LUIGI
Huh

Donkey Kong lumbers past Luigi on all fours

MARIO
GRAB HIM BEFORE HE GETS AWAY

Luigi gets the message and darts after Donkey Kong jumping
into a slide to just barely wrap his hands around Donkey
ong’s ankle He’s dragged through mud and grime before he
manages to plant his feet in the dirt

Donkey Kong though much physically larger than Luigi is
ground to a halt and turns standing on three legs to look
back at Luigi It looks completely ridiculous but judging
by what we’ve seen so far it’s somehow plausible

LUIGI
(staring at the huge foot
in his hand)
-how

MARIO
I told you you’re stronger than
him

DONKEY KONG

Let go of me
(growls)

Before I get mad

LUIGI
(slowly getting more
confident)

NoNo I don’t think so

Donkey Kong roars at Luigi who ducks down under a punch and
spins swinging Donkey Kong by the leg like a giant shot-put
and then lets go sending Donkey Kong hurtling into the sky
Mario catches him with a flipping kick knocking him back to

the ground

The Super Mario Brothers exchange kicks and punches with
Donkey Kong before he finally knocks away Luigi Mario wraps
the cape around Donkey Kong’s head blinding him and then
just holds on tight as the giant ape runs headlong into a mud

pit

MARIO
TAKE A BREATH DK TAKE A FREAKIN’
BREATH

DONKEY KONG
RAAAAAAAR

MARIO
(shouting into Donkey
Kong’s ear as he
struggles)
Calm down you big idiot We’re
here to help Say it Say it

Donkey Kong roars in defiance so Mario slams Donkey Kong’s
head through a barrel ripping the cape in half but knocking
Donkey Kong so hard he nearly passes out

DONKEY KONG
(slumps down stops
struggling)
Uncle

MARIO
(letting go of the cape
releasing Donkey Kong and
dropping down into the
pit)
Christ you don’t give up easy do
you big guy

DONKEY KONG
(sad)
I was very angry I tried doing
the deep breath thing you showed
me but-

LUIGI
(covered in mud pulling
himself up to his feet
furious)

What What You know him

DONKEY KONG
Who’s this guy

MARIO
It’s my brother

DONKEY KONG
(laughs and points at
Luigi like a giant
toddler)

You fight like a girl

Luigi plops back down in the mud shell shocked

MARIO
(by way of introduction)
Luigi this is Donkey Kong Donkey
Kong this is Luigi

Donkey Kong reaches up and pulls a banana-bunch off a tree

DONKEY KONG
(offering Luigi the banana-
bunch)
Have a banana

Luigi picks up his cap and puts it on as Donkey Kong and
Mario laugh at him

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - JUNGLE
Donkey Kong leads Mario and Luigi down a jungle path

DONKEY KONG
It happened this morning Diddy
and I were doing a patrol and then
BAM they came out of nowhere
Raided the town didn’t take
nothing just fired those dang
contraptions of theirs all over the
Place and then they were gone

MARIO
(grimaces)
Standard Wallace tactics hit and
run Guerrilla warfare

Donkey Kong looks affronted

MARIO (CONT’D)
No offense

LUIGI
(interjecting)
How do you guys know each other
exactly

Mario laughs and shakes his head

DONKEY KONG
Back when Mario first landed in the
big bad Mushroom Kingdom me and
the Kongs were still stuck in the
jungle
LUIGI
Stuck I thought you guys lived
here

DONKEY KONG
We did but a fellah by the name of
Kay Rool was keeping us in cages

LUIGI
Is he with Bowser

DONKEY KONG
Naw King Kay Rool’s a different
story Better than Koopa in some
ways worse in others Mario
storms in like a tornado and sets
me and Diddy free and together we
forced Kay Rool’s slimy butt outta
Kongaland Since then Mario’s
been helping us with all different
sorts of stuff farming learning
to readHe’s even trying to help
me keep my temper under control
(laughs slaps Luigi on
the back with an enormous
paw nearly knocking him
over)
Mario is okay by me
(as an afterthought)
That was a brave thing you did
helping your brother like that

MARIO
Yeah Luigi I didn’t think you had
it in you

LUIGI
I find your lack of faith
disturbing

MARIO
Hey that’s fromuh

LUIGI
Star Wars

MARIO
Yeah right Star Trek

DONKEY KONG
(uprooting a tree and
throwing it aside)

Here we are

We pan up and around to reveal

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - KONGTOPIA

ongTopia was a sort of cartoonish primitive village thatch
huts and bamboo-awnings canopy vine-swings and a small
simple dock out onto a beautiful rushing blue torrent of a
river But now everything is different ruined vandalized
ongs of all shapes sizes and Simian genuses go from place
to place trying to put out the myriad of fires

Among them though not referenced by name are Donkey Kong
Franchise Players such as Kiddie Kong Donkey Kong Junior
Dixie Kong Daisy Kong and Tiny Kong Many Kongs lay
bleeding from what appear to be conventional bullet wounds
() and whoever was shooting wasn’t taking time to aim
practically everything is destroyed They all head further
into the town witnessing the destruction as they go

LUIGI
(aghast)
This isHorrible

DONKEY KONG
They headed south TI was so mad I
started to follow’em but I
rethought it and had a message sent
to you I didn’t wanna get into a
fight I couldn’t win

MARIO
(genuinely impressed)
That was very smart of you DK
thinking before you act I’m very
proud of you

DONKEY KONG
(a little bashful)
It weren’t nothin’ really

LUIGI

(quietly to Mario)
All these apes are of different
species

MARIO

(laughing quietly)
Luigi when are you gonna get it
They’ re not really apes at least
not like you and I knew them you
ever seen anything in the zoo that
looked like these things

LUIGI
Well I know they’re not
technically-

MARIO

(noticing something and

gasping)
Oh my god Diddy

Mario leaps forty feet horizontal to a group of five Kongs

who’ve congregated around a smaller
like Kong This is DIDDY KONG

LUIGI
(quietly)
“Diddy”

badly-injured monkey-

Luigi jogs over passing a hut out of which emerges an ape
wearing a derby hat black pants and a yellow vest He looks

like a slightly smaller Donkey Kong

MARIO

This is SWANKY KONG

Luigi Gimme a hand over here

LUIGI
(snapping out of his

clothed-primate related

shock)
Right what’s up

MARIO

(picking up Diddy who’s
about the size of a very

short person)

This is Diddy Kong He’s been

shot

LUIGI
(genuinely baffled)
Shot With a gun

MARIO
(hurriedly)

Yes with a gun Here’s what I
need you to do Go into the jungle

down that way
(points to the south)

Until you reach a patch of

mushrooms

LUIGI

Mushrooms Like Mushroom people

or-
MARIO
(annoyed but trying to
hold back)
No just Mushrooms They’re red
with white spots Pick the
biggest fattest one you can find
it’s going to struggle-

LUIGI
Struggle

MARIO
Yes but don’t let it get away

LUIGI
(a little panicked but
listening)
Okay right then what

MARIO
Bring it back here and feed it to
Diddy chew it yourself if you have
too

LUIGI
Where will you be
MARIO
I’ll be helping with the

evacuation

Swanky Kong through the crowd

The Kongs are a little bit rattled

loudly
loudly

SWANKY KONG
Evacuation

MARIO
Yeah

MARIO (CONT’D)
What you think I’m going to let
you guys stay out here in this
condition

SWANKY KONG
(he talks like an 18th
century diplomat)
(MORE)

and whisper to each other
one gets the impression that Kongs do everything

SWANKY KONG (contd)
I don’t see nowhere safer you could
relocate us to without upsetting
the fragile dispositions of your
(spits the word out)
Respected employers

MARIO

(irked but has clearly

dealt with this before)
First of all Swanky the King and
the Princess are not my employers

(loudly)
Secondly I’1l be taking you
directly into Mushroom City

This gets a somewhat shocked reaction from the Kongs and
another louder round of whispers ensues

SWANKY KONG
Inside the walls
(in full rabble-rouser
mode now)
The Mushrooms will never allow it
they’11 throw us out on our tails

MARIO

(getting mad)
I’ll escort you in myself if I have
too and I don’t give a damn what
the Toadstool authorities have to
say about it

(louder shouting to the

ever growing crowd)
I AM THE TOADSTOOL AUTHORITIES
YOU WILL ALL BE GRANTED FOOD
SHELTER AND PROTECTION BY THE ARMY
OF THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM AND MYSELF
AND MY BROTHER SUPER LUIGI

(Luigi blinks)
BUT ONLY IF YOU COME WITH ME NOW

The Kongs discuss

SWANKY KONG
If this is some kind of Mushroom
trick-

MARIO
(respectfully to Swanky)
I assure you it’s not Swanky You
have my word
(back to yelling to the
crowd)
(MORE)

MARIO (contd)

All of you get all of your
possessions young and wounded and
meet me here in the town square in
ten minutes

(the Kongs start to

disperse and Mario turns

to Luigi)
Why’ re you still here

LUIGI
You said go south Donkey Kong
said that the people who attacked
went south

MARIO
(sighs)
Just follow the river
(turns to the crowd and
singles out a smaller
member)
Dixie

A small adorable Kong turns in a weird way she’s almost
pretty She wears a pink shirt and has a sort of tail of
bright yellow hair growing out of the back of her head this
is DIXIE KONG

MARIO
Dixie take my brother to the
mushroom patch up the river

DIXIE KONG
Sure thing Mario

Dixie heads off down the side of the river

LUIGI
Uh Mario how come some of them
wear clothes and some of them are

naked

MARIO
The ones with clothes have a
condition

Luigi waits for further explanation gets none and says

LUIGI
(giving up)
Ooc000000000-kaaaaaaaay

MARIO
(taking Diddy into a hut)
Hurry up you’re going to lose her

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - RIVERBANK

It’s a beautiful flowing river Luigi jogs to catch up with
Dixie They walk along the riverbank talking and
occasionally we get glimpses of big (and potentially nasty)
creatures under the water

DIXIE KONG
Oh there you are I thought I
lost you
LUIGI
No no I’m here
(quietly)

I’m here with a talking monkey in
another dimension

DIXIE KONG
What

LUIGI
Nothing don’t worry

DIXIE KONG

I’ve never seen you before
Course I’ve only left the jungle
but once and-

LUIGI
No don’t worry I’m new
(after a pause)
Hey what’s up with the Kongs and
the Mushrooms You guys don’t get

along
DIXIE KONG
Mario didn’t tell you
LUIGI
No
DIXIE KONG

OhIt’s a sad story About a
five hundred years ago the Koopas
started to attack the Mushroom
Empire-

LUIGI
Empire
DIXIE KONG
Oh sure Back then everybody
lived together Kongs Mushrooms
Nomadimice Molemites Nimbans
Goombas Koopas Kremlings
Sharkem Crokies
Froggixeverybody

LUIGI
Wow What happened

DIXIE KONG
A very bad man came to power named
Bowser

LUIGI
Bowser he leads the Koopas now
right

DIXIE KONG

(giggles)
Oh no silly not the SAME Bowser
It was his great great great great
grandfather

LUIGI
Ah

DIXIE KONG
Anyways Bowser Super Senior
disbanded the Kingdom He enslaved
the Kongs to do all his building
and cast the Nomadimice out into
the desert The Mushroom people
however lived free because they
were smart and they’d build things
for him One day a Kong named
Wrinkly wanted to stage a riot and
get us free and she begged the
Mushroom people to help
(sad)
But the Mushroom leaders wouldn’t
help instead they turned Wrinkly
over to the Koopas The riot
happened anyway the Kongs got free
and headed into Kongaland and
since then a Kong has never set
foot in Mushroom territory word is
the Mushroom people are afraid of
us

LUIGI
JeezEverything here is
socomplex

DIXIE KONG
Yeah Only one Kong has ever left
Kongaland since He ran away when
the Kremlings invaded ten years
ago

LUIGI
Where’d he end up

DIXIE KONG
Donkey Kong didn’t tell you

LUIGI
Why would he tell me

DIXIE KONG
He usually tells everyone about the
shame of the Kongs It was his
brother

(Luigi starts to talk but

then Dixie runs ahead)
Here we are

(stops points up over

thick grove of trees next

to the river bank)
It’s just over these Mazwanga trees
on the other side of the river

LUIGI
Well how are we supposed to get
over there

Dixie stares at Luigi

LUIGI
(understanding)
Oh you want me tobecause I
canAnd I’d what hold you

Dixie nods

LUIGI
Can’t we just-

DIXIE KONG
(like a little girl
clearly looking forward
to this)
Pl111111111111lllleaaaaase

Luigi looks at Dixie then over at the trees then at Dixie
again

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - MUSHROOM GROVE - CONTINUOUS

It’s a pleasant flowery grove filled with the white red-
spotted mushrooms Mario described It’s silent pleasant and
lovely and then Luigi holding Dixie Kong comes crashing in
from the sky

LUIGI
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH

Luigi hits the ground hard and rolls painfully head over
feet over head over feet across the grove Dixie hopping off
just before he hits There’s a pause and Dixie turns over
Luigi who groans

DIXIE KONG
(flummoxed)
Are you okay

OWWWWW

DIXIE KONG
(helps Luigi up)
You’re not as good at this as your
brother

LUIGI

Yeah well like I said
(brushes some dirt and
grass off of his
increasingly filthy
overalls)

I’m new
(notices the mushrooms)

Why does Mario want one of these

DIXIE KONG
They’ re magic mushrooms

Luigi stares at her He starts to laugh but then stops
himself but then can’t contain it anymore

DIXIE KONG
What
LUIGI
(snorting back laughter)
Nothing

(MORE)

LUIGI (contd)
(looks around)
He said to get a big one right

DIXIE KONG
That’s right
LUIGI
Well that one looks like it’s the

biggest

Luigi heads over to a plump mushroom nearly the size of a
basketball and begins pulling on it

DIXIE KONG
Be careful They fight

LUIG
(uprooting the mushroom)
I got it It’s just a mu-

The mushroom squirms violently butting Luigi in the face so
hard it gives him a nose bleed forcing him to drop it

LUIG
(loudly holding his nose)
Goddamn it

Luigi dives after the mushroom which is somehow rapidly
scurrying away

DIXIE KONG
(laughing)
Grab it grab it

LUIGI
(following the Mushroom
into the jungle)

I’m trying I’m trying-

UNSEEN FIGURE
Got ya

Out of nowhere Luigi gets kicked in the face the impact
flips him into the air and back into the clearing and he
lays motionless face down

DIXIE KONG
(frightened)
Mr Luigi

CLOSE UP ON TWO RUDDY SOLDIER’S BOOTS AS THEY STEP INTO THE

CLEARING

LUIGI
(stirring touching his
jaw)
Argh

UNSEEN FIGURE

(a gruff ruddy voice that

matches the boots)
You know at first I couldn’t
figure out who you were Who would
that sanctimonious bastard Mario
so concerned with rules and
treaties violate his own promise
to Bowser for Who was worth so
much that he’d risk bringing
another human into this world

We slowly pan up the man’s body well-worn dark purple

overalls

a vomit yellow shirt a face that has been through

hell covered in scars from battles fought to survive during
his years wandering the no-man’s lands of the Mushroom

Kingdom

This is WALLACE

He holds a pistol which he taps against his forehead

WALLACE
And then it hit me Who else but
my old pal

(grins a slightly yellow
evil grin)
Luigi

LUIGI
(stunned)
WahWallace

WALLACE
(pointing his gun at
Luigi’s head)
Try
(his evil grin widens)
Wario

There’s a pause for dramatic effect and then Wario steps

forward

LUIGI
GodYou look awful
WALLACE
(laughs)
You know it’s funny because I was
about to tell you that you look
great

LUIGI
(slowly as he stands up)
GreatthanksI guess

WALLACE

(lowering the gun and

laughing)
So what do you think of this
place Must be a real head-trip
living in the Human World for so
long and then boom Mushrooms and
Dinosaurs right

Wallace pauses waiting for Luigi to respond

LUIGI
Wallacewhy are you pointing a
gun at me

WALLACE
Wario

LUIGI
What

WALLACE

I’m calling myself “Wario” now

LUIGI
What Why

WALLACE

It sounds like Mario but scary I
use it to draw a parallel It’s
the same reason your brother wears
the overalls and the cap Here
look

(Wallace reaches into his

beaten up yellow cap with

a ‘“W” on it and puts it

on)
See I originated the look and
now you’re wearing it tell me how
does it feel to be my cover band

Where’d you get the gun

WALLACE

Oh so brother dearest forgot to
tell you about me did he

together)
Where did you get that gun

CUT TO A LONE
RED PIPE IN THE
WASTELANDS

EXT DARKWORLD 1988 - THE ENDLESS WASTELANDS

It’s exactly as it sounds a dark black world pock-marked
with craters lava geysers and caves The sky is a churning
black-red hurricane mass of clouds and rivers of lava run
freely

Young Wallace comes flying out of the red pipe and lands face
down in the ashen dirt but then suddenly pops up screaming
the baby Piranha Plant still chomped on his face He
stumbles around and then yanks it off and hurls it into the
lava

He looks around wipes the blood of his eyes and screams in
frustration then growls like an animal and hops back into
the pipe

INT THE PIPES - CONTINUOUS

Young Wallace flies down a long pipe turns a corner and
hits a dead end there are no off-branches the pipe appears
to have been one-way Wallace reaches the end of the pipe
and SLAMS INTO THE SIDE OF A BOULDER He grabs onto a crag
before he can be sucked back to Darkworld and tries to push
No dice

YOUNG WALLACE
(screaming)
NOOOOOOOOOOODO0DONDO000000000000000

INT KLINE CASTLE 1988 - THE PIPE ROOM

The Mushroom People have manoeuvred a boulder over the pipe
Wallace went down Young Toad grins listening to Wallace
struggle on the other side

EXT DARKWORLD 1989 - THE ENDLESS WASTELANDS - MONTHS LATER

Young Wallace beaten and broken trudges through the
wastelands

WALLACE (VO)
I was lucky that the human
digestive system is powerful enough
to get nutrients out of rocks in
this world I wandered out there
in Darkworld for a year
Itwasn’t pleasant

He weakly hops over a lava flow and then stumbles and falls
on his face weak and then looks up and sees a big golden
pipe towering over him He sloooooocoowly weakly climbs up
it and then topples in

INT CAVE - CONTINUOUS

Young Wallace comes crashing out of a rusted and warped pipe
into cave-slime

YOUNG WALLACE
What

He coughs out some slime looks up and sees a ring of light
around some sort of circular hatchway He climbs up a crude
rusted ladder to the portal and pushes it open

EXT CHICAGO 1989 - SLUM - CONTINUOUS

It’s dank smoggy and disgusting A manhole cover opens up
in the middle of the street and Young Wallace’s head pops
out He begins to laugh

BACK TO 2006 IN
KONGALAND
EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - MUSHROOM GROVE
Luigi looks a little confused

LUIGI
If you got back to our world what
the hell are you doing here

WALLACE
(grins)
I like it here The air is clean
the skies are blue no traffic and
the power of course

LUIGI
Wallace”Wario”Why are you
pointing a gun at me

WALLACE
Well a-duuuuuuuuuh I intend to
shoot you in the face

Luigi swallows

LUIGI
You’ re being serious here aren’t
you

WALLACE

Dead serious

LUIGI
Why’d you bother telling me that
little woe-is-me story about you in
“Darkworld”’-

WALLACE
I just thought it would be lame of
me to walk up and shoot you
Besides we’re friends remember
(his eyes betraying his
insanity)
I mean hell if we’d gone in the
pipe together I bet we could have
been partners Wario and Waluigi

LUIGI
Wallace wait I mean you don’t
want to murder me I’m-

WALLACE
(raising the gun)
I’m already a murderer many many
many times over Luigi Bye-bye
now

Wallace raises the gun

LUIGI
Wallace-

Dixie Kong’s yellow pony-tail whips in and strikes Wallace’s
hand hitting it so hard he releases the gun but in the same
motion grabs on and swings Dixie head first into a tree

WALLACE
(more annoyed than angry)
Stupid freakin’ monkeys

Luigi dives at Wallace and punches him in the face catching
him off guard and sending him flying backwards into a tree
which on his impact cracks in half

LUIGI
(looking at his fist)
Whoa

DIXIE KONG
(pained)
Let’s go Quick before-

LUIGI
(raising a finger)
Shh

Up in the trees dozens of wispy shapes are moving hopping
from branch to branch

DIXIE KONG
We need to go
(frantic pulling on
Luigi’s arm)
Now

LUIGI
(looking at the shapes in
the trees letting
himself be dragged along)
What the hell are-

Machine gun fire rips the grove apart spraying down from the
trees

LUIGI
(finally understands the
urgency of the situation)
Holy crap

He picks up Dixie and runs halfway out of the clearing but
then stops and turns back

DIXIE KONG
(panicking pounding on
Luigi’s chest)
What’re you doing What’re you
doing

Luigi reaches out and snatches a handful of mushrooms Uzi
fire demolishes the area around him and he takes off down
the river Dixie Kong riding on his back Over by the
cracked in half-tree Wallace stands up licking some of the
blood off his lip

WALLACE
(impressed)

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - KONGTOPIA

Mario is guiding the last of the remaining Kongs in caravan
into the jungle headed towards the mountain on which sits

him taking orders

MARIO
As soon as you get back you tell
Craig to sound the horn I want
the leaders of all six kingdoms in
the capital when I get back-

DONKEY KONG
But Mario Bowser will-

MARIO

Bowser will do schmecking nothing
he’s as scared about this as we
are

DONKEY KONG
If you say so Mario

MARIO
Get going
An orangutan-like Kong dragging big golden barrel passes by
(LANKY KONG) and Mario groans and grabs him by the arm

MARIO
(clearly annoyed)
Lanky what’s worth more to you
the barrel or your life

LANKY KONG

ButIs beautiful

MARIO
(now more amused than
annoyed)
I know I know but-

Luigi sprints into the town Dixie Kong still riding piggy-
back

MARIO

LUIGI
It’s Wallace He’s coming With
tree things

MARIO
(grim)
‘“Tree-things”

LUIGI
Red things With GUNS

MARIO

Kong stragglers)
Shy-Guys
(the Kongs react afraid)
Donkey Kong get them running

Donkey Kong nods and lets out an ape’s scream prompting the
Kongs to plow full bore into the jungle

LUIGI
What Shy-Guys What’re Shy-Guys

SHY-GUYS start dropping out of the trees on the south side
of the village holding a wide variety of fire arms
LUIGI

deploy)
Oh cripes

who start to

hissing out
incomprehensi
each other)

it’ll be a massacre

and grabbing him by the
collar)

What the hell are those things
They almost look human

things)

MARIO (contd)
Shy-Guys as close to human as this
world makes and they’re not
pretty they’re from the
neighboring continent of Sarasa a
nasty nasty place Wallace
recruited almost the entire species
to be his personal hit-squad in his
time there

LUIGI
They have guns

MARIO

(snide)
Do they I didn’t notice

(Luigi makes a face)
Koopas Goombas Kremlings they’re
small potatoes they have a
capacity for mercy But these
guys these guys are stone killers
rabid zombie psychos

LUIGI
What do we do

MARIO

(peeks out at the Shy-Guys

through a window)
This is worse than I thought
Wallace is pushing the game up to a
new level spreading his slimy
little fingers all over the
Mushroom Kingdom

(angered)
Wallace found pipes back to the
real world and-

LUIGI
(understanding)
He’s bringing in guns He’s
tipping the scales He’s
corrupting them

MARIO
That’s simplifying it but-

LUIGI
I think I get it now the way you
and Bowser fight minimizes
casualties on both sides
relatively few people die or get
hurt

(MORE)
LUIGI (contd)
Wallace doesn’t play like that and
if they’ve got guns and they keep
using them the way we just saw

MARIO
(nods)
You got it

LUIGI
(looking into the
distance understanding
his role in this world)
Then we’ve got to stop him We’ve
got to stop Wallace before he tears
this whole world apart

Mario finally finds what he was looking for a vase

containing
smiling at

two little red flowers he picks them and turns
Luigi

LUIGI

What

MARIO
(proud)
Nothing It’s just you’re my
brother is all

Mario ruffles Luigi’s hair and they share a brotherly moment

and then a

Shy-Guy pops out of nowhere standing on the

porch contorted bizarrely The brothers yelp and scramble
away ducking behind a barrel

The Shy-Guy lets loose with a long low melancholy scream
and all the other Shy-Guys begin to open fire on the tree
house Mario pops one of the flowers it into his mouth and
chews frantically as the tree-house is turned into swiss

cheese around them

Something strange happens to him his entire body seems to
glow all of his skin letting off an iridescent shine He
points an arm at ceiling and flames look like they drip up
off his palm hitting the roof and blowing a hole ten feet

around

LUIGI
(amazed and a little
scared)
Holy shit
MARIO
It’s a fire flower
(handing Luigi a fire
flower)
Here eat it

Mario stands up throws two balls of liquid fire at a group
of Shy-Guys climbing into the tree house (incinerating those
the fire-balls hit) and launches himself through the roof

MARIO
(shouting as he disappears
through the roof)
Come on

LUIGI
(quietly)
What

The barrel he’s hiding behind is smashed apart by bullets
from the Shy-Guys pouring into the tree-house He scrambles
behind another barrel looks at the flower then jams it into
his mouth

He almost immediately gags but chews painfully and swallows
it down the glow comes over him and he lifts up his hand
the watery fire begins to drip up off of his fingers He
laughs a bit shaky and then stands up and points his arm at
the Shy-Guys (like Mario did) who hiss and shrink back He
moves his arm a little bit clenches and unclenches his fist
trying to it out and then his arm lights on fire

LUIGI
(noticing and starting to
frantically slap his arm)
Ah Gah Jesus Christ

The Shy-Guys perk up realizing that maybe Luigi isn’t as
much of a threat as his brother

LUIGI

(finally extinguishes his
arm)

Yeesh god ah
(looks up at the Shy-Guys
who all raise their guns
at once)

Oh yeeeeaaaah

Mario’s arms reach down and grab Luigi by the shoulders
yanking Luigi up to safety
EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - KONGTOPIA - CONTINUOUS

Mario pulls Luigi up onto a tree branch near the roof and
then sprays fireballs down into DK’s house It explodes into
flame launching the Shy-Guys it doesn’t incinerate out
through the windows

MARIO
(biting his lip)
Sorry ‘bout your house DK
(looks to Luigi)
You think monkeys get good rates on
homeowner’s insurance

(Luigi stares at him)
Nothing Oh okay Tough crowd
(one of the Shy-Guys down

in the town notices them
and lets out one of their
melancholy roars)
We need to get Diddy before they
find him Did you get those
mushrooms

LUIGI
Yeah yeah Wallace almost shot me
in the head but-

MARIO
You got them

LUIGI
(pats his pocket)
I got them

MARIO
(smiles and claps Luigi on
the shoulder)

Excellent

Mario falls back off the tree branch drops forty meters and
lands on his feet Luigi watches as Mario runs across an
“alley” between huts to the big one we saw him carry Diddy
earlier and then duck in the back entrance

Luigi looks after him trying to figure out how he’s going to
make the jump down and then a couple of Shy-Guys start
rapidly climbing the tree Luigi is standing on Luigi takes
one look at the Shy-Guys and then dives head first down
towards the hut
INT KONGALAND - KONGTOPIA - DIDDY’S HUT - CONTINUOUS

Mario comes in picks up the prone Diddy off a hammock and
then Luigi comes crashing through the roof

MARIO
(to Luigi as Luigi picks
pieces of clay and bamboo
shards off himself
pained)
Oh good you’re here

LUIGI
(weak)
Yeah great

he walls are immediately blown apart by bullets letting in
usty yellow rays of light from the setting sun Mario and
uigi duck down and then the gun fire stops Luigi looks
ver at the holes nervous and starts to stand up but for
he second time in the day Mario pulls him back down

torark

flash of red passes by the holes and Luigi looks to Mario
ilent Mario narrows his eyes and crawls over to wall and
eeks out a hole only to have a yellow human eye stare back
t him

9OH P

MARIO
Wal-

Wallace’s arm comes bursting through the wall and grabs
Mario by the face He yanks Mario straight through the wall
by his head breaking it down completely in the process and
then brutally throws him into a nearby hut which collapses
onto him

WALLACE
(to Luigi)
You thought you were gonna get rid
of me with one FREAKIN’ PUNCH

LUIGI
(stammering as always)
Actually I didn’t really have a
long term plan-

WALLACE
(laughs)
Well jeez man think it out next
time
(raising his pistol)
Sorry I forgot no next time-
Donkey Kong’s giant fist closes around Wallace’s torso
clamping his arms to his sides

DONKEY KONG
(lifting Wallace off his
feet)
Not so fast Goomba-fart
(to Luigi)
Get Diddy and get out of here

WALLACE
(laughing squeezed)
Monkey Kong I thought we settled
this back on the girders

DONKEY KONG
There ain’t no settlin’ nothin’
with you butthead You’re on my
list poimanant-lee

Luigi grabs Diddy and runs out the back door as they talk

WALLACE
Ooh You’re scary

Wallace easily breaks free of Donkey Kong’s fist then turns
and punches him directly in the left eye the result is
devastating Wallace is clearly much stronger than Mario
his time in the deserts have granted him physical power on
par with a wrecking ball

On impact Donkey Kong is literally launched dozens of yards
into the jungle plowing down and cracking apart the trees in
his path

Wallace back-flips up onto the roof of the hut and turns
seeing Luigi flee into the jungle He unholsters an uzi and
begins to unload into the bushes but then the hut he stands
on explodes in a shower of flame sending him flying to the
ground nearby

He rolls and stands up to face Mario who stands
outstretched hands flaming in the rubble of the hut Wallace
threw him into The Shy-Guys all contort and turn to look at
Mario The Shy-Guys turn to Wallace looking for orders

MARIO
(loudly)
Make a move

WALLACE
(yelling at the Shy-Guys)
What’re you waiting for you idiots
(MORE)
WALLACE (contd)
(points at Mario)
Shoot him

The Shy-Guys raise their guns

MARIO
Wrong move

Mario turns and sprays fire-balls into the nearest group of
Shy-Guys then cartwheels and somersaults through a hail of
bullets sprays some more liquid fire onto the offending Shy-
Guys flips and lands in front of Wallace and uppercuts him
in the face Wallace backflips on impact but lands on his
feet

WALLACE
Sexy

He throws a punch that Mario dodges and another and
another and another

WALLACE
(still throwing punches
that Mario keeps sliding
around)
Always so goddamn
(oversteps into a dodged
punch and stumbles)
Slippery

Mario kicks Wallace in the back knocking him to the ground

MARIO
Maybe you’re just slow

Mario fires some fireballs at Wallace who rolls out of the
way and football tackles Mario with the power of an eighteen-
wheeler The impact shakes the ground and Wallace drives
Mario into a hut which collapses on them both

and dodges through the vines and branches frantic Up in
the trees behind him Shy-Guys leap and crawl like jumping
spiders

LUIGI

behind him)
Oh crap oh crap oh crap
He turns and raises an arm a puff of fire flies up out of
his palm but dissipates mere feet from his hand It does
however spook the Shy-Guys and they back up into the
darkness of the trees

LUIGI
(quietly)
Better than last time

A couple of the Shy-Guys leap down to the ground and open
fire and Luigi ducks into the underbrush swinging Diddy
Kong like a rag doll The Shy-Guys slither-run after him
gaining ground

fighting The break apart Wallace raises his gun and Mario
raises his arm both point blank

Mario narrows his eyes and a wisp of smoke emits from his
palm Wario pulls his trigger and the hammer clicks on an
empty chamber

WARIO
(more annoyed than scared
or angry)
Dang

Mario punches Wario in the stomach the face the chest and
then the side of the head knocking him down

OWWWWWWWWWWWwWWwwWwwwwwwwww

City you’re going to need a hell
of a lot more than a bunch of
pistol packing linguini druids

One of the Shy-Guys hisses

WARIO
(wiping his mouth as he
stands)
Oh Mario you pontificating self-
righteous idiot We’ve got more
than guns

Behind Mario sheets of fire dozens of feet long spread over
the village a tank has rolled out of the jungle and Shy-
Guys with flame-throwers are standing on board burning
everything in sight

MARIO
(bathed in the glow of the
flame-throwers)
My god

WARIO
(standing up)
My sincere suggestion is that you
run

Mario makes a move as though to run then turns and pokes
Wario in the eye

Gah

Mario leaps up into the trees Wario rubs his eye and
laughs

Luigi frantically forces his way through a dark thicket
catching his clothes on thorns and brambles
LUIGI
Yarh Damn Arg

A Shy-Guy arm plunges in and grabs him by the neck pulling
him up through the roots

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - THE JUNGLE - CLEARING -
CONTINUOUS

The clearing is actually a canopy created by a circle of
giant banyon trees Two Shy-Guys leap and swing like
monkeys one of them pulling Luigi up through the branches
Luigi holds Diddy Kong by a leg like a ragdoll and one of
the Shy-Guys manages to pull him away

LUIGI
(grabbing at Diddy’s legs
as he’s pulled away)
No

Luigi punches the Shy-Guy off of him grabs it by the side of
the head and smashes it against the trunk of a tree cracking
its mask and knocking it out cold we follow its plunge into
the thicket below

Luigi takes an aggressive stance on the nearest branch spots
the fleeing Shy-Guy who’s got a hold on Diddy takes a moment
to think and then dives at it he flies like a missile down
through the branches successfully managing to smash his face
and arms on several spiked branches on the way down

He does however hit his intended target crashing headlong
into the Shy-Guy who is knocked face first into the trunk of
the tree it was standing on (cracking its mask a little)
while Luigi goes flying into a knothole big enough to house a
Volkswagen

The impact knocks Diddy free and his limp little form falls
down through the thicket towards the ground dozens of feet
below His shirt catches on a branch and his fall stops
leaving him dangling perilously

Luigi jumps out of the knot hole and after a “What the hell
am I doing” pause for thought runs down the branches towards
Diddy Kong Just as he’s about to reach him the Shy-Guy
with the cracked mask leaps up onto his back wrapping its
boneless arms and legs around him

Luigi stumbles and falls off the side of the branch dropping
onto a leaf net ten feet below landing on his back and
squashing the Shy-Guy who pushes him off Luigi stands up
in time to see the Shy-Guy draw a combat knife

LUIGI
(quietly in shock)
They have knives now

The Shy-Guy let’s out a low hiss and swings the knife a
couple times Luigi backs up prompting the Shy-Guy to
advance and hiss again The Shy-Guy attacks swinging the
knife at Luigi’s neck and Luigi moves aside grabs the Shy-
Guy’s mask and rips it off

he face he and the audience sees is so horrible that it’s
ard to look at Mario was right they do look more human
han anything else in the Mushroom Kingdom But they’re
wisted and distorted human faces viewed in a shattered
1rror

adheres

t hisses at Luigi and he punches it as hard as he can
nocking off shards of its face as though it were made of
lass and sending it hurtling to the ground below Luigi
hakes his fist and hears the thud as the Shy-Guy hits the
ground below He shakes his head hops up a couple branches
and pulls Diddy down off the tree

eH

29

He lays Diddy down on a wide branch and kneels next to it
taking out the mushrooms he picked back in the grove

LUIGI
(squishing the mushrooms
into little gloppy
pieces)
OkayOkay

Luigi pulls open Diddy’s mouth and puts the mushroom pieces
on his tongue Diddy groggily swallows and moans just as
Mario touches down on a nearby branch

MARIO
You okay

LUIGI
(noticing the state of
Mario’s clothes)
What happened to you

MARIO
I had a run in with Wallace

LUIGI
Is Donkey Kong all right I saw
him get hit
MARIO

and Luigi)
DK will be fine he always is

LUIGI
(quietly)
He saved my life

MARIO

(grins)
So you like the big talking monkey
now

LUIGI
(smiles)
Yeah

MARIO
Good

Mario picks up Diddy Kong and jumps down to a much lower
branch which over time has become a sort of walkway deeper
into the jungle

LUIGI
Where are you going

MARIO
The jungle isn’t a friendly place
at night Lou

Mario heads off Luigi watches him go and then a massive
roar sounds in the distance Luigi quickly jumps down and
runs after Mario

LUIGI

thousand a year He drove a

And that’s just his company’s

cash like nobody’s business he
started a company called “Yoshi”
Apparently he’s struck gold

DAISY
Well with fifty five million a
month I’d say-

ARNIE
No no he’s literally struck gold
It’s how he’s making the money
he’s flooding the world market with
absurdly low prices on gold
silver and something called
Mushlibdinum

DAISY
Mushlibdinum

ARNIE

Apparently it’s some kind of herb
he found on his property he says
it has “restorative” abilities
The testimonials on the site are
amazing one guy says he grew back
his severed fingers-

eyebrows)

you save this place

MARIO
Yeah

DIDDY KONG
He told me about you the first day
I met him he said that you’re his
brother just like I’m Donkey’s
brother and you’d help him just
like I always help Donkey

LUIGI
(after a pause)
How did you know

MARIO
Know what

LUIGI
That I would come That even if I
did come that I would help I
mean how could you have possibly
been certain that I’d play ball
put my life on the line against a
lunatic like Wallace for a bunch of
people I didn’t even know

Mario smiles

MARIO
(sincere)
Cause you’re my brother I knew
you would do the right thing

LUIGI
(laughs quietly to
himself)
“The right thing” is pretty strange
sometimes
MARIO

Youre thirty and you’re just

figuring that out now

Luigi smiles and looks at the fire

LUIGI
She left me Mario
MARIO
(quietly)
Daisy
LUIGI
She left me I woke up Monday
morning and she justShe just
walked out
MARIO
(aghast)
She didn’t say anything or-
LUIGI
(sad)
She said things you know but they
didn’t mean anything “We need a
break” “I need to figure some
things out” “Time off” It was
like talking to a wall
MARIO
Jeez LuigiI don’t know what to
say
LUIGI
It’s okay You’re the last person

I’d expect to get relationship

advice from

MARIO
(a tad offended)
Hey
married-

LUIGI

I’m the one who’s happily

To a princess in an alternate

dimension yeah

They both smile
MARIO
Point taken point taken
(after pause)
You’ re going to be fine

LUIGI
Am I

MARIO
Yeah I promise

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - THE JUNGLE - TREE-TOP -
LATER

The fire is out and Luigi is mostly asleep He notices that
Diddy is a little near the edge and pulls Diddy close for
his own safety He groans and goes back to sleep

Mario unbeknownst to Luigi watched the whole ordeal from a
hanging leaf where he was sitting and looking out over the
horizon

MARIO
(kissing sleeping Luigi on
the forehead)
I love you little brother

Mario rolls over and closes his eyes

FADE TO BLACK

EXT KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - THE JUNGLE - TREE-TOP -
MORNING

Luigi lays motionless still asleep A cacophonous bizarre
noise sounds in the distance a cross between bells and
horns and Mario (who’d been out of frame) jerks Luigi
awake

MARIO
(smiling his usual
ecstatic smile)
Rise and shine Luigi

Diddy Kong who’s dancing over by the edge of the tree-top
turns around

DIDDY KONG
(loudly excited)
The horns The horns
LUIGI
(groggy sitting up and
looking around)

Wazdishere
DIDDY KONG
(his dancing speeding up
ten-fold)
The horns The horns
LUIGI
(confused)

Those’ re horns

DIDDY KONG
(in the background as
Luigi and Mario talk)
Horns The horns They’re
sounding the horns

LUIGI
(straightening up and
putting on his L cap)

What do the horns mean

MARIO
They mean that Donkey Kong got back
to Mushroom City Craig’s calling
a meeting of the Kingdoms

LUIGI
The Kingdoms

MARIO

(ticking them off on his

fingers)
Mushroom Kong Froggix Molemite
Nimban Kremling Koopa

(picks Diddy Kong up

though Diddy struggles

around to get a better

view of the horizon)
There are other species but those
are the ones who’ve organized into
feudal units

LUIGI
(confused)
“Feudal units”
MARIO
Feudal is a generalization each of
the empires has a completely
different socio-political
structure You’ll learn them over
time trust me it all becomes
second nature

LUIGI
Mario I’m not-

MARIO
(raising a hand)
Staying here I know I know

Mario laughs and Luigi looks troubled

INT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE KLINE CASTLE - THE PIPE ROOM

The pipe room is an even bigger mass of activity than usual
Mushroom Guardsmen (armed with swords and shields) stand
watch at nearly every turn as KREMLING MOLEMITE
FROGGIX and NIMBAN regiments pour out of their respective
pipes Striding purposefully with a peg-legged limp amongst
the KREMLINGS is KING KAY ROOL looking straight out of a
particularly grotesque children’s book about Crocodile
pirates

Kay Rool shouts at a Kremling who’s hissing and growling at
some Mushroom women

KING KAY ROOL
Yar First Mate Frowl
(the Kremling turns)
Keep yerself quiet This be
official business not shore leave

The Kremling grudgingly backs off Over near the back
Mario Luigi and Diddy pop out of the pipe to the Lohorsa
Basin landing on the ledge surveying the chaos below

MARIO
(to Luigi about his
landing upon exit from
the pipe)
You’ re getting better at that

LUIGI
Third time’s the charm It’s in
the knees

Mario laughs Luigi looks out over the chaos of the room
LUIGI
Oh wow

DIDDY KONG
(nervously hiding behind
Mario’s legs)

Look at all the Kremlings

MARIO
(patting Diddy on the
head)
Don’t worry about it we’re right
here Any of those scalies try to
make a move Luigi’ll squash’em
flat sn’t that right Luigi

LUIGI
(distracted looking down
into the giant crowd of
bizarre creatures)

What

Mario nods at him

LUIGI
Oh huh sure right

Diddy smiles up at Luigi in reverence A light pleasant
voice sounds up from the bottom of the pipe they stand on

CRAIG (0S)
Mario Crap in a hat where’ve you
been

MARIO

(looks down at Craig and
immediately straightens
up he clearly respects
this man a great deal)
Your highness I’m sorry We got
held up

Mario leaps down next to CRAIG The King of the Mushroom
Kingdom is much changed from the fat wheezing nerd we met in
1988 indeed if anything he’s the reverse

Craig is physically bigger than both Mario and Luigi he
still has some fat on him and his face is still round and
full but now he looks like more like a bear than a pig His
face is covered with strange scars taming the hostile
environments of the Mushroom Kingdom has clearly been hard on
him

He wears a Mushroom-top crown with one star shaped golden
spot on the front a “DARE TO KEEP KIDS OFF DRUGS” shirt and
blue jeans Over it all he wears an enormous majestic robe
the result is so absurd that it works

CRAIG
(clearly overworked and
frustrated)

Held up Mario you can’t just-
(pulls out his inhaler and
takes a hit off of it)

-Send in an order to sound the

horns and leave Peach and I alone

with it

Craig storms off with Mario in tow Mario frantically waves
his arm for Luigi to follow and after picking up Diddy and
taking a moment to judge the distance down from the pipe
Luigi does as he is told He catches up with Mario and
Craig Diddy close in tow catching Craig mid-rant

They walk through the halls of the Kline Castle and Craig
shouts off orders and mandates to Mushroom people who run up
to him with imperatives

CRAIG

(frustrated)
You send the Kongs in here without
so much as a word and here they
are screaming about you granting
them amnesty or that’s what they
would be screaming if they knew the
word “amnesty” scaring the crap
out of the Mushroom people and
then in comes DK two hours later
with a shiner the size of Texas
saying that Wallace and his ilk are
burning the entire Lohorsa Basin

(a Mushroom person with

green spots approaches

and starts to speak but

Craig cuts him off)
Joopo I want security on the walls
doubled archers and spearmen

(Joopo nods and departs

and Craig continues his

rant as though he hasn’t

stopped)
Driving tanks for godsakes real
Earth tanks and DK tells me you
told him to tell me to sound the
horns for the first time in what
two hundred and fifty sixty years

(MORE)

CRAIG (contd)

And so of course I say “Where’s
Mario” And he says he doesn’t
know “Doesn’t know” ™“That’s
ridiculous” I say Mario would
never just wander off

(a Mushroom woman with a

Pink dress walks up

holding a clipboard)
Teema I want a press conference
set up for five PM today get
everyone you can even the rim-town
gazettes ‘ll probably have some
major announcements

TEEMA THE MUSHROOM WOMAN
What can we expect

CRAIG
I have no idea just do it
(stops her as she turns)
And that’s a lovely dress

TEEMA THE MUSHROOM WOMAN
(bowing)
Thank you

CRAIG

(continuing the rant)
And DK says that the last time he
saw you you were trading punches
with Wallace and so I think what
else can I think

(takes a hit off his

inhaler)
Super Mario is dead And so now
I’m panicked and I think what
should I do Should I tell Peach
Should I tell Toad Should I
panic Should I wait it out And
then he tells me you’ve got another
person with you another human

MARIO
(chastised)
I-

CRAIG
(more offended than angry)
You what You tell Peach but you
don’t tell me And how was that a
wise move

MARIO
It’s Luigi my brother
CRAIG
(after a furious pause)
I know that I just got done
shouting at my little sister for
not telling me about it

MARIO
Craig you’re the one who said we
needed reinforcements-

CRAIG
But not from Earth For gluggsakes
Mario when Bowser sees him he’1l
flomp his dorn

Diddy Kong gasps at the foul language while Luigi just looks

confused They turn into a large oaken door
Mushroom men by far the biggest we’ve seen

guarded by big

INT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE KLINE CASTLE - CRAIG’S ROYAL

CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

It’s absurdly extravagant (absurd being the key word with
posters of late-eighties rock bands all over the walls an

old Atari system hooked up to a big-screen TV

and LEGOS all

over the place Luigi looks around at the insanity of the
room and then down at Diddy who looks shell-shocked

MARIO
Craig you’re flomping your dorn

CRAIG
(rubbing his eyes calming
down)
Youre right as usual It’s just-

MARIO
It’s a tough situation I know and
I’m sorry for throwing all that in
your face without giving you any
warning

CRAIG

(laughs it off he’s

already recovering This

kid became King for a

reason)
It’s all right When Kongs started
popping out of the pipes I nearly
had a heart attack
MARIO

Yeah well I had no choice
CRAIG

(blankfaced)

Kongtopia is gone
MARIO

Burned
LUIGI

(stepping forward
speaking up)
Is Kongtopia the only Kong city

CRAIG
(turning to Luigi)
He speaks
(walks over to him)
Luigi how’ve you been

LUIGI
Um Normal

CRAIG
Really I’ve been living in the
Mushroom Kingdom fighting giant
turtle dinosaurs

(claps him on the back)
To each his own

LUIGI
You lookbigger
CRAIG
(annoyed)
Last time you saw me I was nine
Luigi
LUIGI
(quietly)
Right
CRAIG

(by way of answering
Luigi’s original
question)
Kongtopia isn’t the only Kong city
but it is by far the biggest with
a population of eighty
(MORE)
CRAIG (contd)
There are an estimated total of
twenty thousand known Kongs but
few of them join tribes or even
leave Kongaland

MARIO
Speaking of I was thinking of
having a troop deployed to
Kongaland to try to rustle up the
straggler Kongs from Ooga-Booga
Cove and the whole Zumunda Plateau

CRAIG
I’ll get right on it You’re sure
Wallace isn’t still lurking around

MARIO
The destruction of Kongtopia was
just a bid to get our attention to
let us know he’s getting close

LUIGI
Why Why would he want you to be
ready

MARIO

Cause he’s cocky He wants us to
try to fight because he’s
convinced he’1l win

CRAIG
(quietly)
I should’ve killed him back when I
had the chance

Everyone falls dead silent

MARIO
(gently)
There was no way you could’ve known
it would end up this way

Craig frowns and everyone remains quiet

CRAIG
You both look like Birdo poop Get
cleaned up and meet me in the Grand
Hall at noon I’m starting the
meeting there Bowser or no Bowser

MARIO
He’11 be late and he won’t use the
pipes

(MORE)
MARIO (contd)
get the 3rd regiment up in hot air
balloons over the city to keep
watch for one of his galleons

CRAIG
(grins and nods)
Good call Nice to have you back

MARIO
Nice to be back Every time I
leave this place it feels better to
come home again

Mario and Luigi start to leave but then Craig calls after
them

CRAIG
Mario

MARIO
Yeah

CRAIG
Did you um get it

MARIO
What you mean

CRAIG
Yeah

MARIO
Yeah
(Mario reaches into his
front pocket and pulls
out something in a small
package)
Here
(Mario tosses the package
to Craig who catches it
hurriedly unwraps it)
Sorry it got a little muddy when I
was tangling with DK-

Craig finishes unwrapping it it’s a Hot-Wheels car

CRAIG
Oh sweet A Ferrari
(smiles widely at Mario)
Thanks Mario

MARIO
Sure thing
INT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE KLINE CASTLE - HALLWAYS

Mario strolls purposefully through the hallways Luigi
actually managing to keep up this time with Diddy scampering
behind them

LUIGI
He’s the King

MARIO
Don’t doubt Craig he’s the best
ruler possible for this place

LUIGI
What Why

MARIO
He has no selfish aspirations all
of Craig’s politics and initiatives
are about what’s best for the
Kingdom rather than what’s best
for him It’s hard to find guys
like that on Earth

LUIGI
So what do we do now

MARIO

I’m going to find Peach and get
everyone organized for the big
conference then I’m gonna shower
change clothes and meet you in your
room at noon

LUIGI
We’re splitting up

MARIO
Yes

LUIGI

(a little panicky)
What about me What do I do

MARIO
Take Diddy downtown that’s where
you’1l probably find the Kongs
Once you’ve dropped him off head
back to my place shower and get
changed if you need any help just
ask Wooster

(MORE)
MARIO (contd)
he’s the little guy who you were so
afraid of yesterday he runs my
estate Hit the city have some
fun get a feel for the place
Youve got two hours

LUIGI
But Mario-
MARIO
(heading off down the
hall)
Luigi time is kind of an issue
here
(waves)
See you in two little brother
LUIGI
Mario-

Mario jogs off into a crowd leaving Luigi standing with
Diddy Kong

DIDDY KONG
Just me and you now Super Luigi

LUIGI
(reluctant)
Yeah I guess so

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY

Daisy’s orange Miata drives through the winding dismal roads
outside surrounded by trees It starts to gently snow and
Daisy turns on the radio which blasts Wham’s “Wake Me Up
Before You Go-Go”

She goes to turn off the radio but hits the nob too hard and
it pops off falling down by her feet Her car rolls past a
“Welcome” sign for the town deteriorated by time and
weather It now reads “Welcom To Cra p on”

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE

Daisy pulls up in the driveway next to Luigi’s car and gets
out She takes as moment noticing the leaves on Luigi’s
car and then heads up the walkway to the house She knocks
and the door opens a little

DAISY
Hello
Silence

DAISY
(louder)

She taps the door and it drifts open She’s about to go in
when her cell phone rings She reaches out closes the door
and answers the cell phone

ARNIE (ON PHONE)

DAISY
(closing her phone)
You’re damn right

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - CITY STREETS

Luigi and Diddy walk through the bustling streets Diddy
sitting on Luigi’s shoulders Up ahead of them the city
becomes a little more downtrodden it’s like a slum at
Disneyworld

Mushroom Person hawkers become more aggressive even pulling
at Luigi’s sleeves A toothless Mushroom Person holding a
jug (labelled by a mushroom with a skull on its cap) grins up
Luigi

HOBO MUSHROOM
(drunk)
You musht be Luigi here to
shaaaaaaaave the Mushrrrrrrrum
Kingdom

LUIGI
I don’t-
HOBO MUSHROOM
(a little incoherent)
Ha Well you ain’t shhhaving
nothing I seen those thingsh
Wario’s giving to the Shly-Gluys
(pulls down his vest a
little revealing nasty
bullet scars on his white
flesh)
See thish
(makes gun fingers)
BANG BANG BANG

Luigi backs up a little afraid and stumbles into Donkey
Kong’s massive arm Donkey Kong isn’t looking so hot he’s
got an ENORMOUS swollen black eye where Wario hit him He
plucks Diddy off of Luigi’s shoulder and gently pushes away
the Hobo with his other arm

DIDDY KONG
(embracing Donkey Kong)
Donkey

DONKEY KONG
(overjoyed)
Diddy We was worried about you

DIDDY KONG
Super Luigi saved me

LUIGI
(by way of an objection)
Well I-

DONKEY KONG
(laughs)
Ah I knew he would
(ruffles Luigi’s hair with
two of his giant fingers)
I wouldn’ta left you there
otherwise Super Luigi had the
whole thing under control

LUIGI
Really you don’t need to call me
Super Luigi and it was Mario who
did all the work-

DONKEY KONG
(poking Luigi in the
chest very serious)
Ey
(MORE)
DONKEY KONG (contd)
Mario’s lucky to have a brother
like you my brother not so much

DIDDY KONG
Hey
DONKEY KONG
I meant
(narrows his eyes in
disgust and looks
skyward)
Him
DIDDY KONG
(quietly)
Ohhh
LUIGI

What’re you talking about

DONKEY KONG
(quietly)
Mario didn’t tell you
(looks to Diddy)
Run along Diddy Tell everyone
inside about your adventure

Diddy scampers off to a building on the left it’s a musty
old hotel looking straight out of the Old West The
formerly Mushroom Person-sized entrance has been busted so as
to accommodate even the largest Kong and banana peels
surround the building

LUIGI
Well Dixie said-
(looks at the dire
building)
Are you guys living there

DONKEY KONG
(a little ashamed)
Yeah

There’s a guffaw a roar and then CHUNKY KONG comes crashing
through the wall of the Kong Tenement

CHUNKY KONG
Ma Kiddie pushed me

KIDDIE KONG (0S)
(in an incongruous
baritone)
I did not
A rather large and pithy crowd of Mushroom people has

gathered

Donkey Kong and Luigi begin strolling up the street

and they watch the Kong Tenement with anxious eyes

DONKEY KONG
S’not the fanciest place but it’s
inside the city walls It’s safe
safer than out there in the jungles
with those mask-monsters runnin’
around

LUIGI
Do you all fit in there It looks
pretty small especially-

DONKEY KONG

(scratching the back of

his head)
We ain’t ALL in there but it’s a
little cramped yeah But it wuz
where the Mushroom Guard took us
and we ain’t gonna complain
Besides soons as I get a word in
with Mario he’ll get us a better
Place S’he okay

LUIGI
Mario’s fine He’s off with the
Princess doing some magical amazing
thing or other

DONKEY KONG
The way you talk makes it seem like
you think maybe Mario ain’t so hot

LUIGI

(laughing)
No no he is he is it’s
justYour Mario here in Mushroom
Crazy World and my Mario back on
earth are two very different
people Before Mario came here he
was a very unhappy guy

DONKEY KONG
Well of course

LUIGI
(genuinely perplexed)
Huh

talking
DONKEY KONG
E’rybody’s got a purpose in life
and if yah can’t find your purpose
you’re not gonna be happy Mario’s
problem musta been his purpose
wasn’t even in his world so I
reckon that he musta been a very
sad man

Luigi thinks about this and then turns to Donkey Kong

LUIGI
You know for two tons of muscle-
bound barrel throwing talking
gorilla you’re really quite
insightful

DONKEY KONG
I don’t know what “insightful”
means

LUIGI
Ah-hah

INT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE KLINE CASTLE - PEACH’S
CHAMBERS

Everything is PINK PINK PINK and puffy covered in sparkles
stickers puffy sparkling stickers and ads for late
eightiesearly nineties pop groups including an enormous
David Bowie poster Mario sits on the Bed whilst Peach sits
at the desk both of them are all business

MARIO
(flabbergasted by
something)

Read it again

PEACH

(holding a sheet of fancy

paper out in front of

her)
“We in the Bean Kingdom cannot find
reason to attend your dialogue as
we are separated from your troubles
by an ocean Sincerely Queen
Bean”

She lowers the paper
MARIO
“Separated from your troubles”
What like she doesn’t think
Wallace will cross the ocean

PEACH
The Beans are isolationists we’ve
been through this before-

MARIO
But not like this Peach

Peach looks down solemn

PEACH
I know

MARIO
It’s even worse than I thought out
there in the Kongaland Wallace
rolled out a tank

PEACH
(turning eyes wide)
A tank Like a military tank

MARIO
A big one he had the Shy-Guys
driving the damn thing and by the
way he was talking it sounds like
he might have more than one

PEACH
(quietly going over to the
balcony overlooking the
city)
It’s beautiful out today

MARIO
(quiet)
He doesn’t even want to take over
Patricia He says he’s going to
burn it

Peach closes her eyes

PEACH
Mario at the meeting

MARIO
Yeah
PEACH
At the meeting I want you to
propose contacting Booster

DEAD SILENCE

MARIO
You’ re serious

PEACH
As a heart attack

MARIO
Peach-

PEACH

I’ve made the decision Propose it
as your own the boys will take it
more serious that way

MARIO
But I-

PEACH
Once you broach the subject I’11
side with you and state my case
But even as the Princess I don’t
think Bowser Kay Rool or even the
Nimbans will take me seriously

MARIO
(walking over and standing
beside her)
Peach you-

PEACH
Besides

Mario)
I don’t want to be the one who gets
shouted at

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - GADD RANCH

Daisy’s bright orange Miata ambles up the gray stone

driveway towards a big white colonial ranch-house The place
is big but not a mansion it’s the sort of perfect house
everyone would eventually like to live in though maybe a bit
morbid in its construction it almost seems like a house
designed to hold ghosts and ghouls

Daisy pulls up and gets out
She goes up to the steps to ring the bell but then she hears
a loud crash come from around the side of the house There’s
a pause and then the crash comes again She slowly rounds
the house and after a third crash breaks into a jog
something is up

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - GADD RANCH - ROUND BACK

It’s a big property but a lot of the grass is dead and pale
yellow The sky gray as usual shines a toneless
emotionless light onto what looks to be a big stable outside
the main house down a cobbled pathway next to the rocky
beach of a sad little lake Daisy cautiously heads down the
pathway spurred on by a fourth CRASH

She reaches the edge of the lake and walks slowly towards
the stable we get a glimpse through the wooden slats of

something large moving inside and Daisy sees it too she
puts her hand down into her coat revealing the butt of a
holstered pistol

The crash comes again and as it does a hand very suddenly
touches her shoulder Daisy reacts on instinct twirling and
Judo-twisting the man’s arm behind his back This is DR
GADD he’s in his early to mid-fifties bald and a tad
overweight in his pin-striped shirt and khakis His beard
almost seems Victorian in its complexity

GADD
(pained)
Whoa Agh I surrender

Daisy lets him go and he retreats rubbing his arm

DAISY
Sorry youscared me

GADD
I scared you Miss you’re the one
trespassing

DAISY
(suddenly realizing her
situation)
I heard noises from the stable

Daisy gestures weakly

GADD
From where
DAISY
The front door

GADD
Oh so this was originally intended
to be a lawful entry but you
concerned for the theoretical
danger to home’s occupants
proceeded onto my property in order
to come to my theoretical rescue

DAISY
(after a stammering pause)
Yes
GADD
(in classic psychiatrist
form)
I see
DAISY

Look I’m sorry can we start over
(takes out her badge)

I’m Detective Daisuko Miyamoto

NYPD I’m here because I have some

questions about Mario Cassavettes

GADD
(after a pause starts
heading up to the house)
Come on

DAISY
(confused)
Where are you going

GADD
Up to the house you didn’t want to
talk out here did you

DAISY
No no of course not

Daisy takes one last long look at the stable now silent
then follows Gadd up to the house

INT GADD’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

The living room is all white and black marble it’s a large

room with a high ceiling from which hangs a single
ineffective ceiling fan

All of the furniture sits on a big Persian rug at the center
of the room leaving the walls blank and giving those seated
in the squashed center-room-within-a-room feeling
uncomfortably intimate A grand piano sits at the center of
it all Gadd enters from a door out onto the house’s
enormous veranda and Daisy follows

GADD
Can I get you some coffee

DAISY
Yes please Black

GADD
You got it

Gadd exits through a door to the kitchen and Daisy looks
around the odd room casually strolling over to the piano
She plays a few notes the opening cords of the Super Mario
Brothers theme then stops and shouts to Gadd

DAISY
What were those noises

GADD (0S)
One of my horses is very sick he
kicks the doors of the stable in
his sleep

Daisy notices a pile of mail on the table on top of which
sits a bill from a Pharmacy She leans down and looks at it
it’s a bill for a prescription to AccuBreath Inhalers The
prescriber is Dr Gadd and the bill is marked to “Mario
Cassavettes RECraig Kline” Gadd walks back in and Daisy
sits down Gadd not catching on to her reading his mail

GADD
(setting Daisy’s coffee
down on the table and
sitting across from her)
So What’s happened to Mario

DAISY
Nothing’s “happened” that’s the
problem A little over year ago
Mario fell off the map in this
town left his job became a
hermit stopped answering phone
calls and letters from friends
Around the same time he began to
amass an incredible fortune in the
gold market and-
GADD
I’m well aware of all this

DAISY
Right then let’s get down to
business what is your relationship
to Mario Cassavettes

GADD
(sipping a cup of tea)
I’m his former psychiatrist and
currently his friend and business
partner

DAISY
Business partner in what respect

GADD

Mario is often cloistered away for
weeks at a time during these
times I manage Mario’s finances
the operation of The Yoshi Mines
and distribution of the gold
produced therein

DAISY

Is that ethical Going into a
business venture with a former
patient

GADD
Well not technicallyno I’m
really just a small-town practice
one or two patients here and there
But Mario is a verytroubled man
and undoubtedly he would mismanage
his find without help He asked me
to assist him and in doing so
effectively terminated his
treatment

DAISY
How is he “troubled” exactly

GADD
Well now we’re getting into
confidentiality issues and-

DAISY
Ah
(a little bit mocking)
Ethics of course
GADD
(scolded)
Detective what exactly is your
relationship to Mario Is he being
charged with a crime or-

DAISY
No he’s not being charged but-

GADD
Because I seem to remember Mario
telling me about his brother’s hot-
shot NYPD detective girlfriend

They stare each other evenly Gadd sets down
leans forward

GADD

Mario is not a well man Ms
Miyamoto He saw me for five
years and in that time he was a
bipolar depressive only that his
mental state instead of going from
manic to depressive went from
“pad” to “worse” had him on
prozac effexor welbutrin
anything and everything I could
find and none of it did any good
his inner workings were so dire
his self-worth so low that there
was nothing I could do but watch as
he sunk deeper and deeper into
despair as he got older

(sighs looks into his

coffee)
Then one week he doesn’t show up
for our appointment Then another
and another and another and then
suddenly one morning he’s at my
door happier than I’d ever seen
him saying that his life is going
to change and mumbling about
Mushrooms and turtles and whatnot

DAISY
Mushrooms Like Mushlibdinum
GADD
(thrown off his groove a
little)

You’ve done your homework But you
still haven’t told me what this is
all about is Mario in trouble

his coffee

and
DAISY
Actually I kind ofI kind of
BS’d my way in here

GADD
Youre not really a detective

DAISY
(laughs)
No no I’m a Detective I am but
there’s no real reason for me to be
here
(slumps in her chair)
I did a stupid thing

GADD
(puts a finger to his
bearded chin)
With Luigi

DAISY
(quietly)
Yeah

GADD
Said some things you’re regretting
Maybe ended something you shouldn’t
have

DAISY
(a little amazed)
Damn you’ re good

GADD
(laughs)
Well it’s a lot of college isn’t
it

DAISY
Yeah

GADD
So what does this have to do with
Mario

DAISY
Luigi left this bizarre message
saying he was coming up here to be
with Mario and so I followed

GADD
And your job
DAISY
I’m the top detective in Brooklyn
These days they only give me the
showy cases

GADD
SoYou’re snooping

DAISY
(starts to talk offended
then stops)
Yes

GADD
(again in classic
therapist fashion)
Interesting

DAISY
SoAny of this give you any ideas
as to where they are

GADD
They could be anywhere Ms
Miyamoto With all that money
behind them Mario could’ve taken
his

(driving the word home)
Hearbroken brother on vacation to
anywhere in the world I don’t
think you should bother searching
around Crampton anymore

(looks up at the clock)
Actually I’ve got an appointment
in twenty so I’m afraid I must
usher you along in your adventure

DAISY
Always so loyal to the clock
GADD
I value loyalty above all else Ms

Miyamoto
(after a silence gently
gestures towards the
door)

If you don’t mind

DAISY
(standing up)
Just one more question

Gadd walks her to the door
GADD
Yes

DAISY
Is Mario still having trouble with
his asthma

GADD
(opens the door for Daisy)
I didn’t even know he ever had
asthma

DAISY
(nods stepping outside)
All right Thanks for your time

GADD
(realizing that Daisy saw
the prescription)
A word to the wise Ms Miyamoto
Don’t play with Bee-Hives you’1l
get stung

DAISY
(cocking her head)
That’s a bit vaguely menacing
isn’t it

GADD
(giving a playfully
quizzical expression)
Is it

Gadd closes the door in her face

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - GADD RANCH - CONTINUOUS

Daisy stands on the step for a second staring at the door
and then walks down to her car She gets on her phone

calling Arnie

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
Yellllooocoow

DAISY
I just got done with Dr Gadd

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
Anything interesting
DAISY
Too interesting I could’ve tell
whether the guy was a helpful
eccentric or a corrupt slimebag

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
Weird I found more on the Yoshi
mines they’re right there in
Crampton on Mario’s property

DAISY
No way I was just there I didn’t
see anything vaguely resembling a
gold mine

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
They’ve got a picture on the
company’s site with bulldozers
trucks-

DAISY
It’s a fake

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
You going back to check it out

DAISY
Not just yet Do a search of
Crampton’s residents and see if you
can find someone named Craig Kline
K-L-I-N-E

D

RNIE (ON PHONE)
Sure thing

DAISY
I’m telling you ArnieThere’s
something really weird going on
down here

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - GADD RANCH - ROUND BACK

Gadd jogs down the path to the stable and there’s another

crash He opens the gate and goes in

INT GADD RANCH STABLE HOUSE

Gadd comes in everything is destroyed the loft has fallen
apart along with the staircase as though a rhino tried to

run up the stairs There is a suspicious lack of horses or
even any kind of barn animal at all

Gadd looks more disappointed than angry and looks over at
something off-screen

GADD

(cross)
What’d I say about going upstairs
What’d I say about going upstairs
I said you’re too heavy Bad boy
You are a bad bad boy

(wipes his brow a

disappointed parent)
What do you say

We pan over to reveal a large guilty-looking Yoshi sitting
in the corner

YOSHI
Ahm sawee

INT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - CAFE

It’s a blues joint straight out of the nineteen forties
complete with blue lighting and a fat little bearded wrinkle-
faced Mushroom man plucking a guitar on a stool on stage
Luigi and Donkey Kong both looking insanely out of place
sit near stage with both of them seeming comically huge at
the tiny table

DONKEY KONG
So what happens

LUIGI
The airplanes shoot him and he
falls off the side of the building

DONKEY KONG
(disappointeddisgruntled)
Awwww What happens to the girl

LUIGI
She goes off with the human guy

DONKEY KONG
That’s so lame

LUIGI
I know but that’s the point it’s
tragic

DONKEY KONG
Trajic
LUIGI
Sad

DONKEY KONG
Why wouldya make somethin’ just to
be sad Ain’t there already enough
to be sad about

LUIGI
(raises his little wooden
mug)
Hey I’11 drink to that

Donkey Kong picks up his mug between two huge fingers and
they bump cups and drink Luigi swallows and then looks at

his cup

LUIGI
Man what is this stuff

DONKEY KONG
Yopi juice

LUIGI
It’s good like blueberry flavored
milk

DONKEY KONG
What’s a blueberry

LUIGI

(laughs to himself)
Nevermind Tell me about your
brother

DONKEY KONG
Eh you don’t wanna hear that
story That’s a sad story

LUIGI
Hey I told you a sad story you
owe me
DONKEY KONG
(laughs)
Yeah well

FLASHBACK TO
KONGALAND - LOHORSA BASIN - BEACH

It’s a gorgeous bright yellow beach next to an enormous
beautiful bright blue ocean that seems to stretch onto the
horizon forever YOUNG DONKEY KONG and YOUNG FUNKY KONG walk
along the beach Young Funky looks a lot like Young Donkey
save that he has much more red in his fur and a thinner face

DONKEY KONG (VO)
Round ten years ago everything wuz
goin’ real good for the Kongs
We’d started exporting wood and
bananas to the Mushroom Kingdom
with permission from King Craig
and it looked like eventually
everything was gonna work out okay
But then

Young Donkey Kong turns out to the ocean to see an enormous
fleet of galleons Out on the bow of the foremost ship King
Kay Rool stands tall Young Donkey Kong looks to Young Funky
Kong who’s eyes are wide

BACK TO CAFE

DONKEY KONG
And that was that He just turned

tail

LUIGI
He ran before the fighting even
started

DONKEY KONG

Etro Kong wasn’t no fool we’d
dealt with the Kremlings before he
knew what was coming He’d built
thismachine He was always real
good with stuff like that and once
the Kremlings hit shore he hopped
onto his doohickey and off he went

LUIGI
WellI mean one man couldn’t
have made too much of a difference

right

DONKEY KONG
That ain’t what it’s about we
Kongs don’t run from a fight even
if we know we can’t win

(MORE)
DONKEY KONG (contd)

Yah don’t need to go huntin’ for

trouble but if someone’s attacking
your homeland you best be ready to
fight real hard to protect it And

Etro didn’

t even wait for the fight

to start he just jumped into the
birdie he built and

(gestures)
Fwoosh Flew away

LUIGI

His doohickey could fly

(sips

DONKEY KONG
his juice)

Like I said he was real good with

machines

LUIGI

That sounds like an air-
(notices his watch)

Crap

(stands up)

Sorry DK

Oh right

Bingo

What

I’ve got to go

DONKEY KONG
prepare fer the meetin’

LUIGI

DONKEY KONG

LUIGI

(rushing out)

Nothing

See you there

Luigi exits and DK smiles

DONKEY KONG

(mumbles)
Wacky humans

CUT TO LUIGI
SWEEPING OPEN
THE DOOR OF THE
CLOSET IN HIS

ROOM
INT VILLA DE MARIO - LUIGI’S BEDROOM

The clothes in the closet are all a single uniform in
different color schemes (including his fire-flower costume
from the first game and all the different color variations
from Super Smash Brothers) Below them sit a dozen pairs of
boots

LUIGI

Huh
(reaches in and pulls out
an outfit identical to
the one he currently
wears but in immaculate
unworn condition)

This’1ll do

INT THE VILLA DE MARIO - LUIGI’S BEDROOM - LUIGI’S BATHROOM

Luigi goes into the bathroom and looks around it looks to
be a relatively standard Earth bathroom A sink with hot and
cold knobs A bathshower combo over in the corner A
toilet Green towels marked with white L’s A cup with
toothbrushes and tooth-paste

He goes over to the toilet opens the lid and looks in It’s
a normal toilet He flushes it once just to be certain then
laughs at his own paranoia and sits down on the lid taking
off his shoes Just when he was relaxing into the “well at
least the bathroom is normal” vibe a little Wiggler sticks
its head out of the water faucet scaring the bejesus out of
him and causing him to go crashing into the tub

LUIG
(terrified)
Aah

LITTLE WIGGLER
Oi is this the corner of Thirty
Second and Venya

LUIG
Aah

LITTLE WIGGLER
(groans turning around)
I guess not then
(as he disappears into the
pipe)
Sodding human sewer systems like a
maze in here
Luigi sits gasping in the tub

CUT TO THE
FAUCET OF THE
SINK NOW JAMMED
WITH A TOOTH
BRUSH

With the sink situation under control Luigi has gotten into
the shower (shoulders up shots only of course) it’s a
normal golden shower head and he turns it on it sputters
for a moment and then shoots out water Luigi smiles in the
warm water as the caked layers of mud and filth begin to wash
off of him

CUT TO CLEAN
SHIRTLESS LUIGI
STANDING IN
FRONT OF THE
MIRROR

Luigi takes a moment to sort through the items on the
counter most are standard drug-store bathroom supplies with
the exclusion of a small plastic rectangle He picks it up
and looks in very suddenly three tiny purple snake-heads
whip out at him apparently biting his face several times

Luigi yelps and throws the rectangle into the sink and then
notices his reflection in the mirror the places where he was
“bitten” are now clean-shaven He takes a loooong moment to
think and then slowly picks up the “organic razor” Again
the snake heads fire out and begin voraciously dining on
Luigi’s stubble

TINY TRICLYDE
(rapidly shaving Luigi)
Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum

LUIGI
Cool

INT THE VILLA DE MARIO - LUIGI’S BEDROOM - SHORTLY
THEREAFTER

Luigi sits intently at his desk writing something on a sheet
of paper He sits and thinks for a second then scribbles
down another line There’s a knock at the door

LUIGI
(without looking up)
Come in
Mario comes in

MARIO

looking clean and refreshed

Look at you I thought you’d get

lost out there

LUIGI

(still scribbling on his

paper)
NahYou’ve got

all the street

signs set up pretty good

MARIO

Before I got here it was mainly

guesstimation as

to where you were

in the city Can’t have that

right

LUIGI

(turns looking at his

brother)

You’ re really quite an incredible

person Mario

Mario’s face goes completely blank he has no idea what to

do

MARIO
(weakly)

Thank youLuigi

LUIGI

(standing up holding his

document)

I’m being serious going through

the city seeing

all the things

youve done for this placeIt’s
kind of overwhelming And not just

the technological

you know they’ve
tournaments down

stuff either
got tennis
there I even saw

a couple of Mushroom People riding

around in go-car
used to build in
You did all this

MARIO
(taking off
nervous

(MORE)

ts like the ones we
the back yard
in a year Mario

his cap
MARIO (contd)
this isn’t some random
Mushroom person this is
his little brother who
he’s been compared to
negatively since he was
old enough to talk and
suddenly he’s shy low-
self esteem Mario again)
IWell it’s been a little over a
year-

LUIGI
(smiling)
Mario

MARIO
Heh right wellWe’re gonna be
late

Mario rushes off Luigi laughs to himself sticks his
document in his pocket and follows

INT KLINE CASTLE - GRAND ENTRANCE HALL

Luigi finally catches up with Mario the hall is hushed
Mushroom guards stand at every door

LUIGI
Man it’s weird in here

MARIO
Security’s jacked up two of the
biggest threats to the kingdom are
going to be in the castle

LUIGI
Uh speaking of I had some uh
(reaches into his pocket
pulls out the piece of
paper)
Questions to ask you

MARIO
(as they scale the steps)
Hit me
LUIGI

Okay number one I’ve been seeing
a lot of stuff that looks like it
runs on electric power and-

and
MARIO
(swiftly)
Stars

LUIGI

ta

h

MARIO

hen a star falls from the sky the
ushroom people go and harvest it
hey then take wires made of a
etal called Frindium and channel
hem to the simple electronics
hey’ve invented The stars work
or four years regardless of
sage in fact the most severe
hing Bowser has ever done to us
was steal all the stars in the
ingdom and spread them out all
over the world

tonmhattsadt Bes

LUIGI
Right okay number two I’ve been
hearing all sorts of music-—

MARIO
(swiftly)
Mainly our music I bring dozens of
CDs in here each month There was
very little music among the
Mushroom people when I first got
here but they’ve taken a real
liking to trance and electronica
Some have gotten heavily into blues
and soul don’t ask me

LUIGI

Right

(checks his list)
Um the boxes if they’re all over
the place and have been for all
recorded Mushroom history how come
the Mushroom people don’t open
them

MARIO
The contents don’t work for natives
of this dimension

They go through a grand set of doors and start down a long
hall decorated by giant stain-glass windows of Mario Peach
and Craig on various adventures
LUIGI
So like the cape wouldn’t make a
Mushroom person fly and fire-
flowers wouldn’t-

MARIO
Exactly

LUIGI
(checks his list)
And uhBack there in the
jungle you were flying

MARIO
Huh
(remembers)
Oh yeah

There’s a silence as they walk and Luigi looks frustrated

LUIGI
So you just put on a cape and you
can fly

MARIO

(holding up three fingers

and ticking them off one

by one)
There are three ways for humans to
fly around here the cap the cape
and the tail

LUIGI
The cap

MARIO
A cap with little wings on it
It’s fun

LUIGI

(ignoring him)
And I saw the capeWhat’s the
tail

MARIO
(stops walking and stops
Luigi)
You still have the leaf I gave you
before we jumped realities

LUIGI
Sure I transferred it when I put
on my new clothes

MARIO
Get it out of your pocket

LUIGI
(reaches into a pocket on
his overalls and draws
out the small thick
brown leaf)
What is it

MARIO
It’s a Dream Leaf If you’re ever
in a fix where you need to fly
just pop it in your mouth and chew
it up

LUIGI
And thenWhat

MARIO
You grow raccoon ears and a raccoon
tail and then if you wag the tail
hard enough you fly

There’s a dead silence

LUIGI
You’rebeing serious
MARIO
Yes
LUIGI
(taking a last look at the
leaf before tucking it
back into his pocket)
AhHah

They reach a giant set of oaken doors lined with brass

MARIO
You think that’s bad You should
see what you’ve got to wear if you
want to breath under-water
(Luigi blinks and Mario
changes the subject)
Okay chin up you’re representing
all of the Mushroom Kingdoms Stay
near Peach and Craig try to
present a united front

LUIGI
Thus the matching uniforms

MARIO
Speaking of put on your gloves
LUIGI
(putting on his gloves
hurriedly)

Because this is a formal affair

MARIO
(not catching the sarcasm)
Exactly And LuigiTry not to
make us look stupid

LUIGI
I remember when I used to say that
to you

MARIO

(laughs turns to Luigi)
You caught me I’m loving every
minute of this

Mario pushes open the giant doors giving a grand reveal
of

INT KLINE CASTLE - THE GRAND CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The sky is visible through massive sky-lights and the
bright beautiful Mushroom Kingdom sunlight illuminates a
room straight from the tales of King Arthur An enormous
circular table dominates the scene surrounded by
representatives of each of the major civilizations in the
surreal colorful world of the Mushroom Kingdom

A good majority of them look like rejects from Disney Films
twisted anthropomorphic characters too real to be cute but
too strange to be real Seated or standing next to the table
are THE CLOUD KING THE CLOUD QUEEN FROGFUCIUS
MALLOW King Kay Rool a couple of body guard Kremlings
CRANKY KONG Donkey Kong DYNA MOLE and MONTY MOLE

A massive door sits at the other side of the room and
several side doors line the walls behind decorative columns
Up on the second and third floor of the room citizenry and
the press watch the happenings like a theater harkening back
to the operation of ancient European courts

There are two empty seats and they are directly opposite
from one another one of them is grandly decorated with
bottle caps and “Transformers” stickers the other is huge
lined with spikes and chains Mario leads Luigi up to the
table and Toad who stands nearby blows a trumpet

TOAD
(declarative)
The Super Mario Brothers

There’s a gigantic burst of applause from up in the observing
decks and Mario and Luigi are silhouetted by the bursts of
dozens of flash-bulbs

LUIGI
(shielding his eyes)
Super Mario Brothers

MARIO
(laughs waving to the
crowd)
Catchy right

Luigi and Mario step up to the table and the crowd goes
quiet We pan around the table clockwise stopping briefly
on each ruler as Mario quietly talks about them

MARIO
(quietly as the rulers
give ceremonial
greetings)
The big fat alligator at the end of
the table is King Kay Rool He’s
leader of the Kremlings

LUIGI
That’s the guy Donkey Kong was
talking about right The pirate

MARIO

(smiles at Luigi proud

that he’s catching on to

life in the Mushroom

Kingdom)
Right The Kremlings are a lot
like the Koopa Troop they prefer
to conquer rather than kill They
mainly stick to Kong Country but
they’ve got the biggest naval fleet
in this world He may not be a
major player but he’s no joke

King Kay Rool picks something out of his teeth and flicks it
out onto the table it’s the skull of some kind of jungle
animal

LUIGI
(nervous)
By the looks of him I thought he
was Bowser

MARIO
(giggles)
No He wishes he was Bowser
oopa will arrive late make a big
entrance That’s his style

LUIGI
How about the frog guys

MARIO

The old one they’re all standing
around is Kerpdichlaeti I call
him Frogfucius he’s soft spoken
but he’s practically a god to his
people The little puff ball out
in front of him is Mallow one of
the best people you can meet
around here and that’s saying
something He’s the prince of
Nimbus Land but his parents sent
him to live with the frogs so he
could grow up humble

LUIGI
(nodding at the cloud
people at the other side
of the table)
Those are his parents over there

MARIO
Yeah those are the king and queen
of Nimbus Land Technologically
the Nimbans are a bit higher up
than everyone else they fly around
in magical cities that float on
clouds

LUIGI
Ah

Luigi watches as the Cloud Queen smiles warmly across the
table at Mallow who smiles and bows his head

LUIGI
That only leaves the Moles and the
Kongs
MARIO
Right The Molemites are from
Sarasaland the big one is Monty
and the littler one is Dyna They
don’t have a real government over
there I think they must’ve been
elected to come at random

LUIGI
Why do you say that

MARIO
Well let’s just put it this way
If I could pick anyone to represent
Moleville Monty would be the
absolute last name on my list

Luigi watches as Monty picks his nose inspects his findings
looks around to make sure no one is watching and then stuffs
his bounty into his mouth Monty somehow didn’t notice that
the Cloud King is staring directly at him disgusted Luigi

blinks

MARIO

(reluctant about this

whole affair after what

he’s just witnessed)
Yeah

(makes a small gesture at

the Kongs)
The geriatric behind DK is Masrafo
Kong but everybody calls him
Cranky He’s eldest of the Kongs
and therefore ruler by default

LUIGI
Hell of a way to elect a leader
MARIO
(a little annoyed with his
brother)

They’re monkeys Luigi There’s a
Kong named Kongity Kong for
christsakes

Trumpets sound through the giant room and all the leaders
stand in respect (King Kay Rool grumbles a bit but stands
nonetheless) Huge bright purple doors open behind Mario and

Luigi and Craig enters in his kingliest apparel
his side

Peach at

TOAD
(from his position on the
balcony above)
All hail the king

All of the leaders bow slightly and Craig takes a seat in
the bottle-caps and action-stickers chair

CRAIG
Be seated

The Rulers all sit down save Peach who stands by the
throne

MARIO
Any second now

LUIGI
What

CRAIG
(sounding very kingly
indeed)
Let me be the first to welcome you
all to the Mushroom Kingdom And
also let me say how much I
appreciate-

The whirring of some kind of giant engine emanates from
above and the Mushroom people up top start to panic An
enormous KOOPA AIR SHIP passes over the sky-light drawing
gasps and even a couple screams There’s a boom from
somewhere nearby and then another and then another closer
and closer

MARIO
(groans)
Here we go Luigi watch him
carefully Watch the way he moves
I guarantee it’s like nothing
youve ever seen

The heavy steel and wood doors at the far end of the room
burst open and in stomps BOWSER

BOWSER
(bellowing)
Fools Cowardly snivelling fools

Luigi’s jaw drops nearly off his face The creature called
Bowser Koopa is indeed as Mario said much earlier a turtle
dragon But it’s the biggest meanest bipedal somewhat
humanoid turtle dragon imaginable

A giant poof of fire red hair swings back and forth as he
trundles towards the table yellow and green skin shining in
the light coming through the windows a long spiked tail
swinging behind him

His shell is bright green and covered in white spikes sharp
enough to cut your hand on He wears spiked black bracelets
and armbands and two big bulls’ horns protrude from his
temples

He stands fifteen feet tall and probably weighs in the
neighborhood of eight thousand pounds Bowser is a brute
with delusions of grace elegance and nobility a self-styled
demigod convinced of his superiority to all of those around
but still an animal at heart A dozen Goombas follow him
flanked by two large Koopas wearing helmets and holding
sledge hammers (THE HAMMER BROTHERS)

LUIGI
(after catching his
breath quietly in
disbelief)
You’ve fought that thing

MARIO
(nonchalant)
Dozens of times

BOWSER

(ranting)
This cretin disgraces you and kills
your people and this is how you
handle it Calling a meeting
HAH

(a little puff of fire

shoots out of his mouth

making everyone but Mario

flinch)
Mario you’re a warrior Why do
you waste your time with politics
when you could go out there and
crush this human

MARIO
(cool)
He’s got weapons Bowser You
should know that he seemed to have
very little trouble taking out your
troops on the Isle Of Giants

BOWSER
(taken aback)
How did you know about that

MARIO
I have eyes everywhere Bowser

BOWSER
(irked)
If you have eyes everywhere give
me this “Wallace” person’s location
and the Koopa Troop will crush him
like a-

MARIO
Goomba

This shuts Bowser up and he snarls at Mario

FROGFUCIUS
Let me say as the member of this
council in charge of the smallest
number of citizens I am hesitant
to engage in combat The Froggix
have no reason to fight Wallace he
has never harmed us this is the
war of The Mushroom Kingdom not of
Tadpole Pond Why start a fire on
a hot day

CRAIG

I take issue with that Wise One
He’s already staged several raids
on the Mushroom Kingdom killing
dozens of our people Each time
his troops suffered no casualties
He recently directly stated to
Super Mario that he does not intend
to rule our world but rather to
destroy it And mass movements of
Shy-Guy infantry have been spotted
moving towards our city arguably
the social political and cultural
capital of this entire continent

(waits for Bowser and the

Nimbans to stop huffing

and puffing)
The fire is already burning

CRANKY KONG
Agreed wise king With the
weapons Wallace has at his
disposal a prolonged war could be
catastrophic

Monty Mole farts loudly and begins laughing uncontrollably

MONTY MOLE
Did you hear that PFFFBBBT It
sounded just like PFFFFFBBBBBT

Everyone is staring at him he doesn’t seem to notice

MONTY MOLE (CONT’D)
I farted

Silence

MONTY MOLE (CONT’D)
PFFFFFFFFBBBBBBBBBBBBBTTTITT

Silence Monty Mole lowers his head sadly

KING KAY ROOL

(clears his throat and

looks to Craig)
Arrr Honorable King you’ve dealt
with us Kremlins’ before with much
charity considerin’ our less than
spotless past and yee should make
no mistake we’re grateful that you
invited us to this meetin’ seein’
as we’re tryin’ to straighten up
our image get a land based dock
and allBut honestly how tough
could this Wario blighter be You
bally-hoo as though his measly army
could be a match for the Kremlings
or the Koopa Troop Ridiculous
What does he have under his
command eight nine hundred scurvy
Shy-Guys at most-

LUIGI
(stepping forward)
But they’ve got guns

There’s a moment of silence

BOWSER
(menacing pointing a
claw)
What the schmeck is that

LUIGI
(weak in the knees in a
squeaking voice)
I’m Luigi

BOWSER
(eyeing Mario)
I could’ ve sworn we signed an
agreement stating that you would
bring no more humans into our
world

MARIO
(quickly)
He’s not human he’s my brother

Luigi reacts

BOWSER
(slowly)
In this peril you choose to break
our treaties A foolish move
Mario A suspiciously foolish
move

THE CLOUD KING
What are you implying

BOWSER
Simply that Mario a human might
be thinking of siding with his own
kind-

MARIO
(sharply)
The Mushroom people are my kind

BOWSER
(ignoring him)
A time of upheaval such as this
would be ideal for him to seize
power

DONKEY KONG
(stepping towards Bowser
outraged)
That’s ridiculous Mario would
never-

Mario flips up and over the table landing in front of Donkey
Kong holding him back before a monster royal rumble starts

MARIO
Calm down big guy
DONKEY KONG

(after making a false
lunge at Bowser which
doesn’t phase him in the
slightest he goes so far
as to check talons in
boredom)

Awright Sorry Mario

Mario turns to Bowser who sneers at Donkey Kong

MARIO
I didn’t bring Luigi in to help me
take over If I wanted to take
over I could have done it the first
time you kidnapped the princess or
when you captured the dukes and the
Star Wands or the second time you
kidnapped the princess or after
Smithy invaded or the third time
you kidnapped the princess-

PEACH
(groans covering her
eyes)
Point taken Mario

MARIO
I brought Luigi here to help us
Luigi as a human is easily worth
a hundred of your best troops and
you know that

Bowser snarls and then reluctantly nods

Toad nods

BOWSER
You brought him in as a tactical
asset That much I might be
persuaded to believe

MARIO
You will believe it Bowser
because you don’t have a choice
(turns to Toad)
Toad show us the diagrams the
Princess drew

and unveils a large presentation poster board

it is a crayon drawing of a gun and a bullet it looks like
an eight year old drew it

On
Under it is the label “GUN” This draws a surprised
somewhat fearful reaction from the observing decks above and
a reverent silence from the leaders at the table Luigi
snorts back laughter and the Princess sticks her tongue out
at him

MARIO
(nodding towards the
poster)
By now you’ve all seen these

THE CLOUD KING
That’s a
(tentative)
“Pistol” isn’t it

MARIO
Yes King Strato

LUIGI
(whispers holding back
laughter)
King Strato

Luigi lets out a subdued grunt of pain as Mario subtly stomps
his foot

MARIO
Most guns can launch bullets small
chunks of metal up to three
hundred feet that’s the equivalent
of thirty guachos or fifty Koopa-
Metric

CRANKY KONG
Can the bullets chase a target

MARIO
No they move very very fast ina
straight line

BOWSER

(loudly trying to be

constructive)
It has been shown that the shell of
a seasoned Koopa Warrior can easily
withstand multiple hits but the
soft flesh is completely
vulnerable the bullets don’t
always pass through the body
either occasionally they become
lodged causing internal damage

This garners a somewhat impressedfearful reaction
KING KAY ROOL
In Wario’s raids on our harbors I
have seen”guns”That shoot
many bullets at a time They are
larger than the model depicted in
the diagram yes

PEACH

(glad that everybody is

participating)
That’s right There are many many
different types of guns some are
more dangerous than others but
every gun can kill you regardless
of your species

Bowser starts to dispute this but thinks better of it he’s
being surprisingly well behaved

MARIO
Next diagram Toad

Toad nods and turns the diagram over revealing a box with a
stick coming out of it drawn in crayon It’s marked “TANK”
Next to it for scale is a child’s drawing of Mario

MARIO
This is a “tank”

Monty Mole raises his hand and practically jumps onto the
table

MONTY MOLE
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Mario shrugs and groans

MARIO
Yes Monty

MONTY MOLE
I seen one of those I seen Wario
usin’ it teachin’ the Shy-Guys how
to drive’em out in the desert

THE CLOUD QUEEN
(concerned)
What does it do

MONTY MOLE
Well it rolls like a train but
without a track

(MORE)
MONTY MOLE

(contd)

And that end the pokey bit up top
there it can sneeze fireballs
menacing beast it is

MARIO
Why didn’t you report

MONTY MOLE

any of this

Well II sort of forgot until

just now to tell you
It’s a very busy life

the truth
in MoleVille

holes to be dug and whatnot

Everyone looks vaguely pissed at

CRANKY KONG

Monty

What is the power of a tank’s

fireballs

LUIGI
(stepping forward)

They’re not really fireballs

Again everyone looks at luigi
time

LUIGI
They’ re not fireballs

Mario smiles and him and motions
LUIGI

Well they’re like bul
much bigger Like the

He’s more confident this

for him to go on

lets but
size of my

arm And when they impact they

explode
BOWSER

How large are the expl
LUIGI

Large
BOWSER

osions

(lurching slightly towards

Luigi)
How large
LUIGI

(intimidated)
Umbig

They’ re armor-plated

ING KAY ROOL

I suppose
MARIO
Yeah steel sometimes up to eight
inches thick

KING KAY ROOL
(despairingly)
Shiver me timbers

MARIO

We don’t know how many tanks Wario
has or how many guns for that
matter

(getting verbose)
He could strike any Kingdom at any
time using these weapons The Shy-
Guys who he commands do not know
fear nor mercy

(looks to Peach who nods)
It is for this reason that I
suggest we centralize all the
Kingdoms moving their armies and
citizenry here into the Mushroom
Capital

(every one starts mumbling

back and forth but Mario

keeps on)
Even with the combined military
forces of the Mushroom Kingdom the
Kremling fleet and the Koopa Troop
I can’t guarantee our safety But
I can tell you that we can give
Wallace a hell of a fight more
than any of us could on our own

FROGFUCIUS
(angry his little beard
shaking)
This is preposterous You’d have
us abandon our homes

MARIO

Not abandon”relocate” Ona
temporary basis The Kongs have
already left Kongaland for the
safety of the city’s walls With
the bulk of the Koopa Troop camped
out here we could make the city
near to impenetrable to
conventional forces Think of what
we could do with the Kremlings to
help us with fire power and the
Moles to bulk up our defenses
(MORE)

MARIO (contd)
A Nimban cloud ship raining
lightning and hail down onto
Wallace’s forces the Froggix
running messages from the castle to
the troopsIf we all unite under
one flag we have a much better
chance of survival

Mario glances at Peach as all the creatures discuss what he’s
said

CRAIG
(very quietly rolling the
Micro-Machine Ferrari
back and forth on the arm
of his chair)
Vroom Vroom

Peach pokes Craig harshly in the arm and then notices Mario
She nods

MARIO
(a tad quieter than usual)
And I think we should contact
Booster

All conversation at the table stops

CRAIG
What
(stands up)
What

(looks to the creatures)
He didn’t run this by me this is
the first I’ve heard of it I swear
to you

(to Mario)
What’re you doing here What’s
your plan

PEACH
I think it’s a great idea

Bowser rolls his eyes

PEACH
Booster is the only one in the
entire Mushroom Kingdom who has
weapons as powerful as Wallace
it’s only logical that we at least
attempt to reach him
LUIGI
(to Toad)
Who’s Booster

Toad shushes him

THE CLOUD KING
The last time I saw Booster he was
headed south towards Sarasaland in
a gyrocopter in retreat from you
Mario I strongly doubt he’1l be
easily persuaded to-

PEACH
Persuasion isn’t the issue
Booster’s smart He’1ll realize
that it’s only a matter of time
till Wallace goes after him and his
Kingdom

BOWSER
(snorts)
“Kingdom”

PEACH
(annoyed but sojourning
on)
I am convinced that if we approach
Booster peaceably-

CRAIG
Peaceably Peach the guy is as
crazy as a hat made of pancakes

PEACH
We’ve reasoned with him before I
don’t see why we couldn’t again
Lives are at stake

Everyone thinks

CRAIG
WellWho’s going to get him then

There’s a pause and then Toad raises his hand

TOAD
I’1l go

Bowser laughs
BOWSER
I like your spirit little one
And how do you intend to make your
way across the deserts before
Wallace razes your kingdom to the
ground

TOAD

Well I would hope to borrow one of

your Air Ships sir That would
make the whole endeavor much
easier

Everyone at the table laughsExcept for Bowser
looks from Mario to Peach and back he’s smart
figured out the true originator of the “Booster” plan

BOWSER
(quietly)
I’ll do it

The laughter dies down

THE CLOUD KING

What
BOWSER
(louder)
I said “I’1ll do it” It’s not too

complicated a sentence for you is
it moisture-boy

The Cloud King frowns

CRAIG
You’11 loan us an airship

BOWSER

(standing up out of his

giant chair getting

ready to leave)
I don’t see why not as I plan to
have all four of them over your
city within the hour I like the
Princess’s plan band together as
one presenting a powerful united
front

DONKEY KONG
(not understanding
subtext)
But it wuz Mario who-

Bowser
and he’s
Cranky Kong raises his cane to DK’s lips shushing him

BOWSER

I will have all yes all of my
followers soldiers and citizenry
headed into Mushroom Country by sun
down

(looks to the others at

the table)
I suggest you all do the same if
we must die then let us die in the
most glorious battle the Mushroom
Kingdom has ever seen

THE CLOUD KING
Here here

KING KAY ROOL
(getting into the spirit
of things)
Ar Just give me a coupla hours to
rally me mates and we’1ll
stand’ longside yah

CRANKY KONG
You know you already have our
support King Craig

Monty Mole is asleep snoring gently Dyna nudges him and
he snorts and wakes up

MONTY MOLE

(groggy)
What Yes Do Huh

DYNA
The Molemites will come we don’t
want to be out there alone when he
shows up with those “tank”
things

Mario notices Frogfucius heading out a side door with Mallow
and follows motioning to Luigi to stay behind

CRAIG
It’s agreed then Tomorrow morning
we shall unite as one for as long
as necessary until the kingdom is
safe once more Agreed say “Aye”

THE RULERS
Aye
EXT KLINE CASTLE - DOCK

The environment should be modeled after the FIRST STAGE
(outside the castle) in Super Mario 64

It’s the back of the castle which faces the ocean a little
cobble-stone path goes down to the docks where several
smooth sleek Mushroom sailing ships are docked along with
one that looks like an asian tramp steamer It is to this
that Frogfucius and Mallow are rapidly headed Mario jumps
down to them

MARIO
(landing in front of
Frogfucius)
Wise One what are you doing

FROGFUCIUS
(pushing Mario aside with
his cane)
Leaving

MARIO
Leaving

Frogfucius lowers his head

FROGFUCIUS

I’m afraid I cannot join you My
people will stay in our ancestral
home of Tadpole Pond Wallace will
not come for us Why should he
We have nothing to take

MARIO

You’re not understanding Please
please listen He isn’t Bowser
He doesn’t want to take anything
He just wants to destroy it

Frogfucius pauses then shakes his head

FROGFUCIUS
That is ridiculous Nothing is
gained in destruction

MARIO
I know but you’re not understa-
FROGFUCIUS
I’m really quite tired of being
told that I “don’t understand”
human

Frogfucius hops on his boat and Mallow follows

MARIO
(quietly)
MallowYou take care of them
okay

MALLOW
(nods)
I’ll try sir

Mario watches as the boat pulls away from the dock and
shakes his head sadly

INT KLINE CASTLE - THE GRAND CONFERENCE ROOM

The meeting has dispersed and now each of the rulers is
dealing with crowds of Mushroom Press of many species trying
to understand every single point of the meeting

Bowser is conspicuously absent although his Goomba escorts
remain standing stiffly in line eyes up these aren’t the
grunt infantry Goombas we saw out in the jungle these are
the King’s personal guard complete with giant spiked
helmets guarding against unexpected popping

Luigi tries to go over to Craig and Peach who are addressing
the crowd notices something pink slip out of the room in the
corner of his eye and he follows

INT KLINE CASTLE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Luigi comes out of a side-exit to the Grand Conference room
and looks around the hallway is completely empty He slowly
starts heading down it

LUIGI
(loudly)
Hello Is anyone here

He passes a hallway that branches off and as soon as he
does Bowser’s massive form pops out behind him bathed in
shadow as per usual Luigi takes a few more steps and then
stops realizing he’s being watched He slowly turns and
looks up at Bowser’s enormous dinosaur jaws

Bowser takes a step forward out of the shadows revealing
bright fires burning in his pupils

LUIGI
Oh
BOWSER
(slowly)
Super LuigiMario’s brother
correct
LUIGI
I
(straightens his collar
Bowser is by far the most
intimidating terrifying
thing he’s seen in the
Mushroom Kingdom so far)
Um

Bowser lifts up a gargantuan hand and pushes Luigi who loses
his balance and falls on his butt Bowser smiles

BOWSER
The younger weaker brother
brought in out of desperation a
last panicked hope of survival

LUIGI

BOWSER
(baring his teeth a
little)

You think I don’t know what Mario

was in YOUR world
(chortles)

It’s written all over him he was

pathetic Alone A born loser

LUIGI
(crawling away a little as
Bowser advances)

You

BOWSER

I can only imagine what kind of
disgraceful wretch you were Dear
god if you’re even worse than
Mario what revolting new low were
you at that you had to come here
Sleeping in the street Sorting
through garbage for clothes
Eating sewage

(MORE)
BOWSER (contd)
(growls)
You are WEAK
(roars)
YOU ARE NOTHING

Bowser swings an enormous clawed paw down at Luigi At the
last possible second Luigi shoots up an arm out of instinct
and grabs Bowser at the wrist stopping the massive claws
just before they can tear off his head

Bowser stands there for a moment straining and Luigi’s
strength begins to wain Bowser’s shaking hand moving closer
and closer to his face Bowser suddenly gives up (even
though it seemed as though he would win) pulling back his
arm

BOWSER
(smiling ever so slightly
nursing his wrist)
Maybe not so weak after all

Bowser turns and starts to head away up the hallway then
stops and talks over his shoulder

BOWSER
I expect that you and your brother
will accompany the little Mushroom
on his suicidal quest into the
Deserts Of Despair to contact Sir
Booster

LUIGI
(weakly)
oeelDe

BOWSER
Excellent

Bowser goes back into the Grand Conference Room Luigi sits
on the floor for a moment eyes wide and then collapses
onto his back staring at the ceiling and lets out a
loooco0c00000ng breath

LUIGI
Holy crap
INT THE VILLA DE MARIO - LOUNGE

Luigi and Mario sit across the table from each other clearly
deep in conversation

MARIO
And he just walked away
LUIGI
Yeah well first
(imitates Bowser)
“Maybe you’re not so weak” but
then yeah he just turned around
and

MARIO
(imitating Bowser’s
footsteps)

Boom Boom Boom Boom

LUIGI
Exactly

MARIO
Scared you pretty good didn’t he

LUIGI
(puts his hand on Mario’s
shoulder)
Mario I nearly browned my over-
alls Do not leave me alone around
him again

MARIO
(laughing)
Ah forget it Bowser was just
testing you

LUIGI
Testing me He nearly ripped my
face off

MARIO
And then

LUIGI

Then I came to you

MARIO
hat were you saying about a pink
hing just a minute ago

a

LUIGI
Oh right

CUT TO LUIGI IN
THE HALLWAY

Luigi lays there still on his back and something pink flits

by him

He scrambles to his feet and looks around
down at the far far end of the hall KIRBY stands

silhouetted in the light of one of the windows
of sight

He flits out

BACK TO LIVING

LUIGI
But it was only there for a second
and-
MARIO
Its name is “Kirby”
LUIGI
Kirby
MARIO
It’s from Dreamland
LUIGI
Dreamland right you’ve said
that
A pause
LUIGI

And Dreamland is

MARIO
This is another dimension Luigi
(sits back in his chair
sighing)
Sometimes there’s just no
explaining things

LUIGI
(after a pause shaking
his head)
I’m sorry Mario but that isn’t
going to cut it

MARIO

(pondering)
Think of Kirby likeLike a fairy-
godmother or an angel He doesn’t
talk he’s almost never seen but
he’s always there always present
always watching And sometimes if
the time is right and you really
really need himHe’s on your
side

ROOM
LUIGI
What do you mean

MARIO

(standing up shrugging)
I don’t know He’s never appeared
to me he’s like an urban legend to
the Mushroom people

(smiles heading over to

the window)
So Bowser said he thinks we should
go with Toad

LUIGI
Yeah he said he “assumed” we
would

MARIO

Good Cause I’ve wanted to ride on
one of these things for so long
(gestures at something out
of the window)
Just look at the size of it
wouldya

Luigi stands up and goes over to the window with Mario

LUIGI
What’re you looking at
(looks out the window
then speaks very quietly)
Oh

We pan around to what they’re looking at The item in
question is tethered to the highest parapet of the Kline
Castle like a zeppelin attached to the spire of the Empire
State building Imagine every beautiful majestic graceful
mage of a sixteenth century galleon you’ve ever seen Now
low it up to the size of an air-craft carrier and you’re
tarting down the right path

nO OR

It hovers without any visible means of propulsion enormous
wooden frame lined with thin steel cannons lining the sides
gigantic billowing sails flutter and shake with the wind
and Koopas and Goombas scurry from place to place
straightening and adjusting things

LUIGI
(slowly)
That’sbig
MARIO
(grins)
Yeeeeeeeeceeah

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE KLINE CASTLE
Toad sits on his suitcase surrounded by Goombas and Koopas
who look like they want to eat him whole He looks around
understandably anxious and starts whistling The Koopa
Troopas move in a little closer and one of the Goombas licks
its lips

Toad looks directly at the lips licking Goomba and blows it a
kiss the Goomba blinks and then steps back looking around
nervously at the other Goombas who look to Toad

nq

Toad slides the hem of his vest aside revealing the butt of
a nasty looking scimitar style sword then taps his belt
that has fourteen notches in it The Goombas back off

Mario and Luigi walk up Luigi looking nervous in the
presence of all the Koopa Troopas

MARIO
Toad You okay

TOAD
(giving the lips-licking
Goomba one last glare)
I’m beautiful

They all start up the ramp to the ship and the Koopas and
Goombas hesitantly follow

PEACH
(rushing up the ramp after
them shoving one of the
Goombas out of her way)
Mario Mario

Mario stops and turns and Luigi follows suit
PEACH
(embracing Mario)
You be careful

MARIO
I’m always careful
PEACH
I’m just worried for the Kingdom
morale is going to be low with both
you and Toad out of the city

MARIO
DK is here he’s smarter than you
give him credit for If you need
help with anything you go straight
to him

PEACH
(clearly nervous)
You be
(kisses him)
Extra careful I have a bad
feeling

MARIO
It’ll be fine Patricia Next time
you’1l see me I’1l1 have Booster’s
army right behind me

PEACH
(backing down the ramp)
Yeah well just make sure they’re
not chasing you
(Mario laughs but Luigi
looks nervous and Peach
speaks once more saying
something completely
baffling)
Don’t ride the wrong roller
coaster right

Mario rolls his eyes and Peach laughs hoping down to the

ground

Mario and Luigi walk through the hatchway

the Air-Ship

INT AIR-SHIP - HALLWAY

It’s equivalent to a hallway on an aircraft carrier

boarding

but made

of wood and lit by torches instead of electric lights A

Goomba leads Mario

the vessel

GOOMBA FLIGHT OFFICER
(snarling)
This way Marios

Luigi and Toad further into the bowels of
LUIGI
(quietly)
See what you did

MARIO
What

LUIGI

“Super Mario Brothers”
all think our last name is

MARIO
(laughs)

Oh come on

Now they
“Mario”

nobody’s that stupid

They turn a corner passing by a large chamber containing

what appears to be a tiny Sun
dish

Solar flares leap across its surface

contained in a sort of metal-
and burn Goomba

technicians who work the electrical machinery plugged into

the metal-dish apparatus

Luigi stares at it for a moment

and then a Goomba bumps him moving him along

LUIGI
(getting back on track)
And what’d she mean “don’t ride
the wrong roller coaster”

TOAD
(looking back at them)
Booster makes roller coasters

LUIGI
Booster as in “the scary guy we’re
going to try to cajole into
cooperation” Booster

TOAD
None other

GOOMBA FLIGHT OFFICER
(nodding its massive head
at a door)
Your quarters Mushroom

TOAD
(grins)
You hear anybody screaming in the
night this is the door you kick
down right Mario

MARIO
(smiles at Toad
Right

fatherly)
Toad goes through the door The Goomba turns and walks down
the hallway and Mario and Luigi follow

LUIGI
Who or what is Booster exactly I
mean not to be a pain in the ass
here but I feel like I’m getting
left in the dust

MARIO
No sweat Lou To be honest I
don’t really know Booster he ran
away as soon as I showed up
Apparently he’s some sort of mad
scientist builds all sorts of
crazy Looney Tune machines in the
mountains at the far end of the
Deserts Of Despair he calls it
“Monstro Town”

LUIGI
Sounds pleasant

MARIO
You have no idea Anyway he’s
managed to gather something of a
cult following out there marauders
and nomads You know types who
don’t fit in anywhere else they
all seem to end up with him

LUIGI
What is he I mean what species

MARIO
I don’t actually know

LUIGI
But you’ve seen him-

MARIO
Well I’ve “seen” him but I’ve
never “seen” him

LUIGI
(after a pause)
Huh

MARIO
He wears this big suit of armor
with blades all over it he could
be anything under there

GOOMBA FLIGHT OFFICER
(pushing open a door with
his forehead)
Your quarters Marios

LUIGI
(whispering)
You hear that He did it again he
said-

The brothers look into their quarters it’s beyond spartan
Two wooden boards for beds laying on a floor covered by a
big dirty rug with a picture of Bowser on it

LUIGI
(nervously)
Well this is going to be fun

MARIO
(smirking)
You have no idea

INT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - THE CHIPPED CUP DINER

It’s a small town All-American diner that has like
everything else in the SMW version of the “real world”
undergone a sort of entropy

The pictures on the wall hang crooked too high or too low
and the wall-paper has mostly peeled and rotted away
especially around the door A poster above the bar reads
“The Chipped Cup - Where the glass is always half-full” and
has a picture of a smiling woman holding a cup of milk

Time has eroded the image the woman now looks more like a
snarling hag than a smiling house-wife and the milk has
taken a very suspect yellow tint

Two guys play pool on a black pool table with all grey

balls save the Eight-ball which is a lovely shade of flesh
eating disease red Daisy sits at a booth at the far end of
diner staring at the plate in front of her

On it sits runny slimy eggs and bacon that looks veiny and
raw possibly sentient Daisy stares at the food and it
seems to stare back She picks up her fork and hesitantly
pokes the bacon which seems to squirm just a tiny bit
causing Daisy to jump nearly out of the booth She slowly
makes her way back to the plate and slowly picks up the fork
again when her cell phone rings making her twitch She
answers

Daisy closes the phone and sits thinking One of the pool
playing guys pipes up

player)
Where’s the three-ball

Jesus
(yells to the woman behind
the counter)
Mona Anderson stole the three-ball
again

Mona a blue haired biker chick behind the counter turns and
looks at a thin twitchy white guy sitting near the door

MONA

Anderson screams in victory and runs out the door the two
pool-players give chase Daisy is nonplussed

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - THE CHIPPED CUP DINER

Daisy exits and walks to her car She stands there at the
driver’s side door then sobs and collapses against the car
beating her head against it Eventually she regains her
composure and gets in the car

After a pause to further get herself under control she
starts the car and the radio blasts “Let’s Hear It For The
Boy” at full volume Daisy goes to turn it off but then
sees that her volumeonoff knob is still broken She slumps
forward putting her head on the steering wheel

INT AIR-SHIP - MARIO AND LUIGI’S QUARTERS

Mario and Luigi lay on the bunks their over-alls straps
down talking and laughing

LUIGI
Whatever happened to those anyway

MARIO
I found like ten of them a couple
months back when I was cleaning
your room

LUIGI
Which ones

MARIO
Mom dad and a little Paper Mario
The edges were all frayed though
There were some pictures in there
of our crushes too

LUIGI
No kidding Like what grade
MARIO
Fifth Grade
LUIGI
Ooh like Marjory Styles
MARIO
Or uh Pauline Mazursky
LUIGI
Yeah she looked good from afar
but
LUIGI MARIO
She was far from good She was far from good

The brothers laugh but then Mario’s eyes widen and he
raises a hand silencing Luigi

MARIO
(quietly listening to the
sound)
Oh god

LUIGI
(standing up off his cot)
What What’s wrong

MARIO
(rushing to the door)
Helicopters

LUIGI
(eyes wide)
Helicopters

Luigi follows Mario out the door both of them running

EXT THE AIR SHIP - MIDSHIP

Mario and Luigi run on deck just in time to see a military
helicopter swing around over the bow of the Airship a dozen
Shy-Guys leaping off the landing struts and onto the deck
shooting the Goombas and Koopas that rush to stop them a
couple Goombas and Troopas manage to get the jump on the Shy-
Guys chomping or smashing them but once the Shy-Guys get
their guns up the fight is mostly one sided and the deck
becomes a mess of purple dust and blue glop

MARIO
(infuriated)
Oh this is just shmeckin’
wonderful

Mario runs up the stairs to head off the Shy-Guys Luigi
just stands still a little shocked

LUIGI
(quietly)
He taught them how to fly
helicopters

A helicopter rises up just to Luigi’s left and a Shy-Guy
with a gattling gun opens fire reducing that area of the
deck to splinters

Toad appearing from nowhere tackles Luigi out of the way
and they take cover behind one of the cannons along the
ship’s side The Shy-Guy howls and opens fire and we zoom
out to reveal that the Air Ship is entirely surrounded by a
fleet of twenty-five helicopters of various types

LUIGI

(quietly frantic)
How the hell did he teach those
things to fly helicopters

TOAD
(pointing up deck)
Luigi look

Mario has leapt off the bow of the Air Ship onto the side of
one of the helicopters He climbs up to the rotor and tears
it off The helicopter begins to drop and Mario jumps off
running along the edge of the Air-Ship He throws the rotor
like a Shuriken and it slices into the cockpit of another
helicopter which drops out of the air like a rock
disappearing into the clouds An Apache helicopter fires a
Sidewinder rocket at him and he grabs it in mid-flight his
weight dragging it down out of sight beneath the airship

LUIGI
What’ s-

Mario now hang-gliding on the missile comes sailing up from
the other side of the ship He runs across the deck being
pulled by the missile and then lets go tossing it like
javelin the rocket impacts into one of the larger
helicopters turning it into a churning mass of fire

LUIGI TOAD
Wow Wow

MARIO
(yelling at the
helicopters)
Where are you COME OUT WHERE I
CAN SEE YOU

A large carrier helicopter comes up alongside the Air Ship
and the bay doors open Wario stands tall against the winds

WARIO
(commanding the dozens of
machine-gun wielding Shy-
Guys around him)
FIRE

The Shy-Guys start shooting blowing apart the thick wood and
steel sides of the ship like they’re made of Styrofoam

Luigi and Toad run through the bombardment trying to get to
Mario who’s frantically directing Goombas and Koopas to the
cannons

MARIO
Return fire Return fire

Toad and Luigi take cover behind another cannon Several of
the Koopa Troopas manage to get focused and fire one of the
enormous cannons at an Osprey Combat helicopter to their
left There’s a billow of thick black smoke out of which
flies a huge ravenous BULLET BILL It soars into the side
of the Osprey its steel crushing jaws tearing the Osprey in
half As the helicopter falls the Bullet Bill follows
tearing off and devouring pieces like a piranha

WARIO
(quietly)
Schmeck’ Super Mario
(turns to his troops)
Burn it

The Shy-Guys on the helicopter raise flamethrowers and spray
fire out onto the sides of the already badly damaged galleon
lighting it up like a bon-fire

TOAD
The ship’s on fire

LUIGI
(deadpan)
Thanks for the update Toad

TOAD
What do we do

LUIGI
(panicking)
I don’t know I don’t know

TOAD
But you’re Super Luigi

LUIGI
(losing it completely as
an RPG zooms in from
behind him)
I’m NOT FREAKIN’ SUPER LUIGI I’M
LUIGI DAVID CASSAVETTES I’M A REAL
ESTATE AG-

The RPG strikes the cannon they’re hiding behind blowing it
off the deck and sending them both flying in different
directions Luigi rolls across the deck twenty feet away
and scrambles to his feet to find himself surrounded by
Goombas and Koopas looking dangerous Luigi gulps One of
the Koopas steps forward

KOOPA AIR TROOPA
(plaintive)
What do we do

There’s a nervous pause and then Luigi stands up dusting
himself off recovering Luigi looks around noticing a
nearby cannon

LUIGI
(pointing at the cannon)
Do you guys know how to work that

Up on Wario’s helicopter he shouts to the Shy-Guys

WARIO

Keep shooting Sweep them off the
decks-

(notices a big plume of

black smoke from one of

the cannons amidships

and sees Luigi waving at

him)
What

A Bullet Bill comes sailing up at his transport copter and
Wario dives out down onto the deck of the airship The
Bullet Bill catches the helicopter around the center and
shakes it like a chew toy sending Shy-Guys and mechanical
parts flying every which way

The helicopter’s fuel ignites and lights up the sky ina
huge yellow explosion which rocks the airship badly

WARIO
Goddamnit It’s not supposed to be
this way

Wario draws an uzi and blows away several Goombas then
throws a grenade up-deck that blows two Koopas out into the
sky Very suddenly his lower leg is slashed badly

WARIO
(pained)
Argh
(turns and sees Toad
holding his scimitar
Wario’s eyes go wide
furious)
You
TOAD
(smirks poses imitating
Wario)
ME

Wario raises the uzi and fires at Toad who nimbly leaps up
onto the rigging of one of the masts and slices a rope to
his left The counter-weights drop and Toad is pulled up
into the sails

Wario takes a huge leap after him landing next to him on the
mast firing his uzi wildly Toad ducks behind the stem of
the mast which is splintered apart by Wario’s uzi fire

WARIO
(pulling the pin out
several grenades)
Suck on this

Wario throws the grenades and they catch on the sails the
subsequent explosion blows the canvas free of the masts and
it goes fluttering off of the airship causing the entire
vessel to lurch badly Down on the deck Luigi is thrown
face first into the barrel of one of the cannons nearly
knocking him out

Mario continues battling the boarding Shy-Guys even though
he’s nearly thrown overboard Luigi looks up to see that
several Shy-Guys have manned the enormous cannon which now
faces directly at him

LUIGI
Oh

Luigi scrambles towards the aft and the Shy-Guys fire the
cannon the Bullet Bill goes chomping through the deck like a
chainsaw cutting through ply-wood gulping down several
Goombas and Shy-Guys as it goes

Luigi leaps out of the way literally at the last possible
instant and the Bullet Bill goes crashing through the
railing and flies off the side of the ship Luigi lays
panting on the deck and looks up at the mast to see Toad
facing down with Wario who’s drawn a machete

WARIO
I’ve been waiting a long time for
this Mushroom

TOAD
(raising his scimitar
impatient)
Well let’s not wait any longer
You going to swing that nail file
or am I going to have to wait all
night

WARIO
What this
(looks at the machete)
Oh I was just holding this for
looks

Wario tosses the machete over his shoulder and in the same
motion draws a Glock and shoots Toad twice in the chest

Toad stumbles back looking at the wounds and then drops off
the side of the mast he hits the deck and explodes into a
dozen twelve inch long spores which float up into the air

Wario laughs but can’t gloat for long as Mario tackles him
from behind smashes his head against the mast punches him
in the throat and throws him down to the deck which he
crashes through into the galley

MARIO
(screaming frantically to
Luigi)
THE SPORES

LUIGI
What

MARIO
(ducking and dodging
through gunfire from Shy-
Guys)
GET THE SPORES

Luigi nods hesitantly and then leaps down deck grabbing the
spores out of the air with one hand clutching them to his
chest with the other The last one floats overboard and
Luigi dives after it without thinking catches it and starts
to drop He screams and punches his free arm into the side
of the ship

CUT TO A ROOM
IN THE AIRSHIP

Luigi’s arm sticks through the wall

BACK TO LUIGI
DANGLING OFF THE
SIDE OF THE AIR-

SHIP

A Koopa rapidly turning into purple dust drops past Luigi

LUIGI
Crap

What Luigi doesn’t notice however is that the spores he
carries have slowly started to merge back together

Up on deck things are rapidly degenerating into a massacre
Only a few Goombas and Koopas are left and they’re being
decimated by the now dominant Shy-Guys Mario and Wario are
in an all out brawl knocking each other around and through
the ship like pin balls Mario getting the worst of it
though certainly holding his own Wario fights like a super-
powered street punk Mario is all about grace and style but
Wario’s sheer strength tips the odds in his favor

He manages to punch Mario directly in the nose sending him
smashing into the deck tearing up planks of wood as he goes
Back under the ship Toad has fully reformed under Luigi’s
arm though Luigi is too panicked to notice

TOAD
Luigi

LUIGI
(startled)
Aah

TOAD
Your hand’s on my butt

LUIGI
ButI thought you were dead

TOAD
There’s no time to explain we have
to help Mario

Toad naked (though we don’t see anything explicit of
course just his cute little Mushroom butt) climbs up over
Luigi’s head and hops up onto the deck There’s some
scurrying around and then Toad appears fully clothed with
a rope

TOAD
(throwing the rope down to
Luigi)
Come on

Toad pulls Luigi up and they see Wario walk over to the
felled Mario pulling his machete out of where it’s imbedded
in the deck Luigi and Toad run at him but Wario hears them
coming and turns flinging the machete at Luigi who drops
under it just in time but still gets a nasty slice across
the shoulder

Toad reaches Wario who punts him like a football into a
bulkhead and he collapses motionless Wario turns and
sees that Mario though badly injured has vanished Wario
reacts as any eight year old would to a frustration of this
level he shakes his arms and does a furious little stomping
dance

WARIO
Schmeck schmeck schmeck
(screaming into his walkie
talkie)
We’re done here Blow it up

Luigi grunts holding his wound and then turns hearing a
helicopter approach from behind It swoops over him anda
bomb drops off of the side catching the Air-Ship right in
the center

The subsequent explosion cracks the ship in half with Toad
Wario and most likely Mario on the front half and Luigi on
the back which is already beginning to drop

Luigi muttering and cursing to himself pulls himself along
the now nearly diagonal deck to the edge of the ship The
other half of the ship is still floating

twenty feet away now thirty fortyThis is his last
chance Luigi takes a huge epic running jump towards the
other half and flies in what is hopefully the only use of
slow motion in this production windwmilling his arms and
kicking his feet towards the other half

EXT THE AIR SHIP - SKY - CONTINUOUS

Luigi misses the cracked edge of the air ship by a couple of
inches his fingers grasping at nothing

LUIGI
(starting to fall)
OOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
SHHHHHHHHITIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
IIIIIIIIIIIIIT

Luigi begins the thirty thousand foot plunge towards the
desert below For a couple of seconds he flips end over end
out of control but then recovers his senses enough to reach
into his overalls pull out the leaf Mario gave him and pop
it into his mouth He chews rapidly panicked Nothing
happens He waits

The ground gets closer and closer and then a look of shock
and anguish washes over his face We watch as a huge bushy
raccoon tail bursts through his overalls just above his
tailbone Two little raccoon ears rip out of his hat and
Luigi begins frantically wagging his tail Soon the tail is
a blur behind him and just as he would’ve struck the ground
he evens out into a 150 mile an hour glide inches above the
sand dunes

LUIGI
(finally understanding at
least a little bit what
Super Mario World is all
about)
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOO

Luigi turns his glide back upwards soaring like Superman

LUIGI
(nodding smiling self
congratulatory)
This is okay I can work with
this

Luigi flies up in and out of the clouds headed for the
still-flying half of the Air Ship

EXT AIR-SHIP - CONTINUOUS

Luigi flies up and around to find Wario trying to board a
helicopter and nails him from behind just as Mario did
earlier in the jungles to Donkey Kong He slams Wario into
the floor and punches him in the back of the head several
times knocking his face against the deck Wario shoves him
off and turns drawing a straight razor

WARIO
(wipes his face)
Oh great Amateur hour

Luigi goes to punch Wario again who swats his fist away and
cuts him savagely across the face

LUIGI
(stumbling back raising a
hand)
Ahh

Wario slices Luigi’s extended hand across the palm and then
knees Luigi in the stomach dropping him onto all fours
Wario uses his straight razor to slice off the Raccoon tail
and the ears disappear in a poof of yellow smoke

Wario kicks Luigi several times lifts him up by his collar
punches him twice and then throws all his weight into a gut
punch that sends Luigi flying into one of the masts which
cracks a little on his impact

WARIO
(laughing)
Timmmmmmmmmbeeeeeeeeeer

The mast fully cracks and topples over onto the prostrate
Luigi smashing him beneath it and then drops off the side
of the air ship

MARIO
(appearing from the
shadows of the shattered
lower decks badly hurt
whispering)
Luigi

WARIO
(noting that the front-
half of the air-ship has
started to drop
dramatically towards the
desert)

(MORE)

WARIO (contd)
And on that note I think it’s best
that I bid you all adoo-ey Smell
you later
(screams)
Losers

Wario makes an insane jump up into one of his remaining
helicopters The helicopter banks sharply and we see that
unbeknownst to Wario Mario is holding onto the bottom As
the rate of descent increases the wreckage shifts and then
bursts apart revealing the badly beaten and cut up Luigi

LUIGI
(shouts)
Mario
(coughs a couple times
touches his bloodied
face)
Ahh
(shouts)
Toad

The ship’s position goes from diagonal to vertical now
falling very very fast There’s a scream and Luigi turns
and sees Toad struggling against the winds he’s buried his
scimitar into the deck and is holding on for dear life

LUIGI
(yelling)
Toad hold on

TOAD
(screaming)
Luigi Luigi Help me

Luigi spits out some blood and reaches into his pocket
pulling out the silver vial

LUIGI
(very quietly)
Please god let this be something
useful

Luigi dabs the liquid metal on his skin and it almost
immediately expands and wraps around his entire body all of
his exposed flesh becoming reflective and metallic

LUIGI
(looking at his arms)
Cool

TOAD
(screaming)
HEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPP

Luigi snaps out of his reverie and jumps over to Toad his
now super heavy body cracking the side of the bulkhead he
hits He grabs Toad by the arm and pulls him close

LUIGI
I’ve got you I’ve got you don’t
worry

An Apache attack helicopter fires a sidewinder towards the
remaining chunk of the ship

LUIGI
Okay worry a little

The sidewinder impacts the explosion sending Luigi and Toad
hurtling down towards the desert (with Toad being protected
from the flames by Luigi’s metal body) They go crashing
down into the dunes with an impact bordering on meteoric
Luigi releasing Toad after three bounces

Toad lands roughly in the sand but Luigi keeps brutally
bouncing and rolling up down and across the dunes leaving
an impact streak as he goes Pieces of the metal fluid are
scratched off little by little until when he last bounces
agonizingly off screen there’s none left on him he’s a
bloody pulp and we hear him go crashing into the dunes

looking through an arcane yet incredibly powerful telescope
Both look grim Wooster crosses the room

(quickly)
We know

WOOSTER
They-

CRAIG
(peering through the
telescope)
We see

We pan around to look at what Craig and Peach are so
frightened by A battalion of twenty five tanks and nine
Armored Personnel Carriers has appeared on the hills ten
miles out from the walls several weird spider-web-like
tents have been set up between them and Shy-Guys perch all
over everything perfectly still their blank pupil-less
mask eyes staring towards the city

Craig moves away from the telescope looks at his feet and
closes his eyes Wooster recognizing this to mean that
Craig is thinking pulls out a note pad anda quill

CRAIG
Send out telegraphs to the Koopas
Kongs and the Moles tell them to
only approach from the southwest
and to try to move in large groups

PEACH
Have all the Moles who’re already
here start digging trenches twenty
yards from both sides of the wall

CRAIG
Man the towers on the walls and
give the digging Moles a Koopa
Troopa guard Have the Kremling
ships that’ve arrived so far pull
around into the bay so that their
cannons face those hills Tell
them that if those tanks move so
much as an inch closer to the city
they can fire at will

PEACH

Wooster nods and runs out the door we hear him crying out
“Urgent orders Urgent orders” as he shoves his way down

underside of the chopper gripping it so hard his fingers
have made deep dents into the metal One of his eyes
twitches

pan down to Daisy sitting outside of her motel room looking
out into the stars thinking

We pan past the wreckage of Bowser’s airship and some dead
Koopas and Goombas (aka purple dust and blue goop) some
fallen Shy-Guys and their sand filled guns and then we zoom
across the desert to Luigi’s crater where Toad covered in
scratches seeping green blood keeps silent vigil over
Luigi’s beaten broken motionless form

The screen freezes and large 8-Bit letters pop up reading

and a caption pops up

INTERMISSION

EXT DREAMLAND

It’s a bizarre surreal world half light blue sky and half
pitch black night down in the darkness slimy snarling
slithering things move about barely seen Luigi somehow
intact (despite the fight and the brutal fall) lays ona
cloud unconscious as the cloud slowly drifts down towards
the darkness The sweet voice of a very young boy speaks

KIRBY (0OS)
(sing-song soft)

LUIGI
(slowly opening his eyes)
WhuhWhere am I

Luigi looks up into the bright blue sky and sees something
floating down towards him in slow concentric circles a small
pink spot on the bright blue sky The audience will
immediately recognize this as Kirby the little pink puffball
we saw earlier after the meeting of the rulers but Luigi is
slower to catch on Kirby’s mouth doesn’t as he talks
implying some kind of telepathy

KIRBY
(floating closer lazily
chasing down after the
descending cloud)
You’ re in Dreamland

LUIGI
(slowly)

LUIGI (contd)

WhatWhat happened to the desert

KIRBY
You fell a very long way You were
going to die and if you died it
would make everyone very sad
(offers its fingerless
hand)
Here take my hand

LUIGI
(considering)
Mario said you couldn’t talk

KIRBY
(giggles sweetly)
Mario doesn’t know everything

There’s an odd throaty hiss from below them

KIRBY
(a little urgent but not
panicked)
Take my hand You need to hurry

LUIGI
What Why

KIRBY
You can’t stay here much longer or
youll become a dream like me
down there
(points)
That’s Nightmare Land It’s a bad
place

Luigi looks over the edge of the cloud and the gnarled fangs
of something ancient rotting and evil suddenly snap up at
him making him jump back

KIRBY
(to shocked Luigi)
Take my hand

LUIGI
(taking a last cursory
glance over the edge of
the descending cloud)
That sounds like a deal

Luigi grasps Kirby’s tiny conical arm and Kirby flaps his
little cones lifting them both up up and away from the
sinking cloud just as it’s torn apart by Nightmare Monsters

Luigi looks down and another Nightmare Monster jumps up and
snaps at him but he’s well out of its reach

LUIGI

(looking down at the

monsters)
Jesus

(looks up at Kirby)
You need to take me back to the
Mushroom Kingdom I need to warn
them about Wallace

KIRBY
(floating them up higher
and higher)
I’m sorry I can’t do that

They float past all manner of glowing bizarre stars and

hearts

candy canes and purple orbs strange surreal

creatures sing soft crooning lullabies In the distance
some sort of enormous light green wormhole swirls off into

nothing

Kirby floats them towards the wormhole

LUIGI
(frustrated)
Why the hell not You can take me
here but you can’t take me there

KIRBY
Silly Luigi I didn’t actually take
you anywhere You’re still out in
the desert All I did was stop you
from dying

LUIGI
But I saw you earlier didn’t I
In the real world

KIRBY
You’ re asking good questions
Luigi You’re learning

LUIGI
Yeah well once things get weird
enough you just start accepting
things as you see them

KIRBY
(giggles)
I like you Luigi You’re smart
Luigi panics and screams

vortex

LUIGI
(noticing the wormhole as
they approach it)

What’s that

IRBY
It’s a wake-hole a gate back to
your body in the physical world

LUIGI

(coming to a realization)
In the physical world I just got
my ass kicked and fell like two
thousand feet don’t send me back
there yet

KIRBY
I’m sorry Luigi but I told you
you can’t stay here or you’ll
become a dream like me

LUIGI
(a little frantic as Kirby
floats him over the
wormhole)
Just wait let me think here-

KIRBY
Don’t worry Luigi

LUIGI
Give me a second give me one
second-

KIRBY
Whenever you need me you just ask
for Kirby I’m always here right
behind your eyelids

EXT SARASA LAND - THE DESERT

It’s a seemingly endless perfect desert round
dunes stretching as far as the eye can see

and Kirby drops him into the

sloping

occasionally

spotted by a dead tree or a perfectly round ball-cactus
pan down to reveal Luigi laying a top a pile of air-ship

wreckage

looking much the worse for wear as he very well

should be after the beating and the fall

We

He’s covered in cuts scratches bruises and scrapes His
nose is bleeding possibly broken and he’s got an awfully
painful looking black eye One of the straps on his overalls
is torn He gasps in some air and sits up straight

Luigi looks around desert to the left desert to the right
desert in front and behind and in the sky a sun that seems
impossibly big and bright Toad sits at his feet staring
intently at him

TOAD
(overjoyed throwing his
arms around Luigi)
You’ re alive

LUIGI
(wiping the blood away
from his nose glaring
into the sun)
Shit

EXT KLINE ESTATES - MORNING

It’s an enormous house modeled after the one Luigi
“inherits” in Luigi’s Mansion The place is immaculately
white the first really clean and orderly place we’ve seen in
the real world and therefore immediately suspicious even
somewhat eerie Daisy’s Miata rolls up the drive-way and
stops at the front door

Daisy gets out and looks up at the strange house starts for
the door and then stops some strange harp music is playing
inside (fans will immediately recognize it as the “Water”
music from the first Super Mario Brothers game)

INT THE KLINE ESTATES - EXTRAVAGANT FOYER - CONTINUOUS

The doorbell rings it’s the same creepy chime from Luigi’s
Mansion There’s silence and then the quick pitter-patter
of stocking feet

EXT KLINE ESTATES - CONTINUOUS

The big door swoops open revealing a diminutive older woman
in a white house-dress patterned with wavy somewhat
disorienting black lines that seem to waver slightly
whenever she moves adding to the unpleasant dizzying
effect

Daisy stands there staring at her trying to make sense of
the dress and the woman LYDIA Kline speaks up in a voice
that transitions rapidly and often in between dottily insane
and downright obnoxious

LYDIA
Can I help you

DAISY

(managing to tear her eyes

away from the horrible

dress)
Yeah

(straightens up)
Yes I’m Detective Miyamoto NYPD
I’m here to ask you some questions
regarding an unsolved
disappearance

(reacting to the somewhat

befuddled face Lydia

makes)
You’re not obligated to let me in
or even talk to me

LYDIA
(still wearing the puzzled
expression)
No no it’s all right Please
come in Neville and I are just
having lunch

Lydia turns sharply and marches off into the house Daisy
reluctantly follows

INT THE KLINE ESTATES - EXTRAVAGANT FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Daisy walks into the house which is all sparkling marble and
dull granite The walls are covered with family portraits
that seem to go all the way back to the stone age Daisy is
so preoccupied by the bizarre portraits that she walks
directly into Lydia who’s stopped dead in front of her

DAISY
(recovering from the bump)
Oh sorry-

LYDIA
(stabbing out a bright-red
finger nailed hand)
I’m Lydia

DAISY

LYDIA

DAISY
(after a second’s pause)

LYDIA

this point)

Lydia grabs Daisy’s arm and shakes it vigorously before
Daisy recoils a little afraid

LYDIA
Come on

Daisy follows Lydia further into the house

EXT SARASALAND - THE DESERT

Toad is slowly helping Luigi to his feet They stumble and
Luigi falls face first

TOAD
Ah I’m sorry

LUIGI
(spitting out some bloody
sand)
It’s okay it’s okay Fourteenth
time is the charm come on

They slowly painfully work together to get Luigi up and he
finally manages to stand on his own

LUIGI
There we go
(looks around desert in
all directions)
Suddenly I don’t remember why I
wanted to stand up

Toad stays quiet watching Luigi
LUIGI

What’d you say this place was
called again

TOAD
We’re in Sarasaland the Deserts Of
Despair

LUIGI
Deserts Of Despair It’s almost
Dickensian

(wipes his brow)
I’ve got a broken nose bruises and
fractures all over and I think
either my knee-cap is busted or my
leg is broken

(limps a little higher

sees desert everywhere)
What’s the quickest way out of
here Toad

TOAD
(quietly)
UhQuickest

Luigi squints through blood pain and sun-glare at Toad

LUIGI
No quick way out eh

TOAD
The Deserts of Despair stretch for
thousands of miles and-

LUIGI

Well are there any pipes
TOAD

Huh
LUIGI

Pipes you know the big green
ones

TOAD
How should I know Not even Mario
has mapped out the whole desert
During the day the sun gets so hot
it burns the skin and at night it
gets so cold it can freeze a
Mushroom solid

LUIGI
(looking around taking a
limping step)
So what do we do

TOAD
I don’t know
(rubs his shroom-cap)
Sit and wait for rescue I guess

Luigi looks up at the sky and chuckles out a sick sound

LUIGI
Man screw that Gimme that board
TOAD
What
(picks up a board)
This

Luigi nods and Toad tosses him the plank Luigi puts the
plank under his arm as a crutch and starts limping into the
desert

TOAD
(confused)
What’re you doing

LUIGI
I’m walking

TOAD
What Why

LUIGI
Because I’d rather die on my feet
than sit around waiting for rescue
that won’t come

TOAD

ButBut

(chasing after him)

The odds of finding anything are
tiny we’ll just wander until we
bump into a Pokey or-

LUIGI

What’s a Pokey

TOAD

By the time we see one it’1ll be

too late

Then

LUIGI

we’1l have to be extra careful

not to see one

EXT KLINE ESTATES - VERANDA

It’s a beautiful snow white veranda overlooking a huge garden

filled with sickly looking pink flowers
appear to be varicose veins

covered in what
quite a horrific sight indeed

Daisy sits in an uncomfortably small chair opposite Lydia and

a massive ball of bearded flesh called NEVILLE Kline

Neville wears an uncomfortably tight button up vest and tight

white short-pants

he looks like a grotesque rendition of

Tweedle-Dee They talk in what seems like an all out shock-

and-awe assault of verbiage

NEVILLE
Our real children

This shuts Daisy up

DAISY
Weren’t they-

LYDIA

(titters insanely)
Oh the original Craig and Patricia
were such strange children so
bizarre always

(gestures laughs rolls

her eyes)
Lost in their own heads

(gets very serious)
Learning disabled you know

(sits back)
You can never really know children
like that they were like little
strangers living with us

NEVILLE
But Craig David and Patricia Susan
have been such successes

(MORE)

NEVILLE (contd)
much more like the children we
should have had

(laughs)
Craig and Patricia were clearly
some sort of cosmic mistake

The couple laughs together Daisy shakily puts down her tea
cup horrified She looks around trying to think of
something to say and finally comes out with

DAISY
Were bodies ever found

NEVILLE
(chuckles)

No We assume that boy Pike

convinced them to run away

LYDIA
We were concerned at first

NEVILLE
Very concerned

LYDIA
But then we found this

Lydia lifts a book up off the table It’s “DIANETICS” by L
Ron Hubbard

NEVILLE
(sage)
It’1ll change your life

DAISY
(trying to stay on topic)
This Pike kid are his parents
still in town

NEVILLE
Dead

LYDIA
As Dillinger Drunk driving it
figures really people like that

DAISY
Like what

LYDIA
(sneering)
Nuvo riche
(MORE)
LYDIA (contd)
(Daisy visibly draws a
blank)
New money

NEVILLE
New dirty money more like it
(Daisy leans in
interested prompting him
to continue)
The father Spike Pike-

LYDIA
A ghastly name for a ghastly man

NEVILLE
Was the criminal type he was a gun
retailer

LYDIA
Whole saler

NEVILLE
And not respectable hunting
weapons he sold high power stuff
all over the world

LYDIA
Not that we’re in favor of gun
control

NEVILLE
Of course not But the man had
connections criminal connections

DAISY
Is there a chance Wallace might
have kidnapped your children

NEVILLE
Oh no no no
(chuckles)
Wallace was only eight

DAISY
And where is he now

LYDIA
Gone He went missing that night
with Patty and Craig

DAISY
So-

LYDIA
Look we’re tired of this we want
to put it behind us

NEVILLE
Yes we answered all your friend’s
questions why do you need to hound
us

LYDIA
We’re trying to forget past
mistakes and-

DAISY

disgust to be confused)

EXT SARASA LAND - THE DESERT

Luigi limps along in the dunes Toad close behind Luigi is
singing he’s no great talent but he’s certainly not painful
to listen to

LUIGI

(singing tired)
Looooong agoAnd not so far
awayI fell in love with
youBefore the second showYour
guitar played so sweetlyBut
youre not really thereIt’s just
the radio

(looks around the endless

desert and abruptly

changes course Toad

follows and Luigi sings

loudly)
Don’t you remember you told me you
loved me baby said you’d be coming
back this way baby baby baby baby
baby baby babyI love youI
really do

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - WOODS

It’s silent and peaceful in the woods exotic and alien
butterflies flitting from place to place and then a tank
rolls by plowing down everything in its path Five more
follow crushing and snapping the delicately beautiful flora
and fauna like cellophane

Wario sits astride the lead tank’s big gun grinning We
move past him up into the sky to get a genuinely
terrifying view there forty more tanks following the first
five moving in the shadows of twenty combat helicopters

Wario laughs looking back at his battalion and then turns
forward into a punch in the face

It’s Mario he looks filthy beaten and in a very sour mood

Mario presses his advantage hitting Wario twice more with
kung-fu strikes and then grabs the shaft of the tank’s gun
and bends it swiftly wrapping it around Wario as the tank
grinds to a halt Mario begins savagely punching Wario in
the face again and again with his right hand tearing his
white glove and bloodying his knuckles

MARIO
(screaming)
You killed my brother You killed
my brother You-

Mario notices that about two hundred Shy-Guys forty five
tanks and thirty helicopters now all have guns pointing at
him and stops punching Wario Wario spits out a tooth

WARIO
(sick pained child-like)
Hehehehehehe

Mario flips up onto a tree bounces off it somersaults
backwards and vanishes into the woods all the while Shy-Guys
blast apart everything in sight Wario groans and bends
apart the gun-shaft of the tank freeing himself

WARIO
Cease fire
(fire continues unabated
and he screams)
CEASE FIRE

One of the Shy-Guys makes a quizzical sound and snarls

WARIO
He’s long gone by now idiot

The Shy-Guy makes a warbling hiss of protest and Wario turns
and shoots him in the face his mask cracks and his flesh
shatters apart like glass this is how shy-Guys die The
empty robe floats down off the side of the tank and Wario
looks into the jungles

WARIO
Kamek

KAMEK appears from the hatch of the tank nervously
grinning

KAMEK
(scared)
Yeth your majethty

WARIO
How many times do I have to tell
you moron don’t call me that
I’m not king of anything

KAMEK
Yeth thir thomtimeth I jutht
forget

WARIO
Any news

KAMEK
We’ve been getting thom very
thtrange report-th from our
thcouts it theems all the
kingdomth are thtaging a math
exthoduth to Muthroom Thity

WARIO

(thinking)
They’ve united they plan to make a
stand against me

(thinks looking into the

woods)
The game has changed but the
players are the same

(turns smiling at Kamek)
I just don’t think those morons
realize what twenty billion dollars
will buy you these days

We pan up to get another view of Wario’s army and realize
what we saw the first time was less than half

one hundred and twenty tanks and armored vehicles roll over
the green plains leaving greasy black tracks of torn up
earth AMX-30s MBT 2000s T-64s T-72s T-62s BMP-23s
Boragh APCs Type 60 Recoilless Gus SO-120s Kader Fahd
APCs BOV-VP APCs BTR-152s PLZ45s ZTS Danas M1975s 2S5s
and M107s

He has enough artillery there to take on any major army on
Earth in a ground war and give them a hellacious battle this
isn’t going to be a fight t’s going to be an outright
massacre

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE WALLS

The walls of Mushroom City are fifty feet high made of
enormous stone blocks held together with concrete steel
plates and mortar They ring the entire city meaning that
the walls if straightened would stretch for just over a
ninety five miles

Walkways line the inside of the walls at every twenty feet
and Mushrooms Kremlings Goombas and Kongs hustle and bustle
along them going about the duties of reinforcing the walls

A huge caravan of Koopa civilians and Molemites comes in
through the gigantic gates Peach and Bowser stand on one of
the parapets from which they can see not only Wario’s army
massing in the hills but also the Kremlings the Koopas The
Mushroom people and the Kongs working together to mount
Bullet Bill cannons along the top of the walls

PEACH
(looking to Bowser)
It’s kind of nice to see them
working together isn’t it

BOWSER
I’ve never put much value in the
word “nice” Princess Besides my
attention is diverted

(nods to Wario’s army)

More and more of those “tanks”
gather in the hills with dozens
more headed this way Gold must
truly be invaluable in your world
to buy all of these weapons

PEACH
You say “your world” as though I
still have stock placed in Earth
King Koopa

One of the Kremlings stumbles whilst hoisting a cannon and
the cannon falls yanking him off of his clawed feet The
cannon tumbles down smashing through the walkways and
finally jerks to a halt

We pan up to see that Donkey Kong up on the wall has caught
the rope to the cannon All the workers Mushroom Molemite
Kremling and Koopa alike laugh and applaud Donkey Kong

smiles bashfully at them unsure of how to handle the sudden
attention

BOWSER

My airships approach from the
south over the water and Big
Bertha reports that the Kremling
fleet grows closer every second
If we attacked now we could wipe
him out

PEACH

(grimacing slightly)
He won’t even be there yet
Wallace will arrive last with the
biggest section of his troops he’s
never been the most patient guy
He’11 only be here for the
bloodshed All attacking now would
do is waste our troops and tire
them out before the real battle
We need to wait him out get our
defences as strong as possible and
let him make the first move

(pause)
What then I don’t know

BOWSER
A thought strikes me if we were to
land my four strongest ships
outside the North Walls and
relocate the cannons so that they
all faced the hills they could
serve as armed barricades

PEACH
(nods)
That’s smart but why not just land
all the ships He can’t attack us
from the air

BOWSER

(darkly)
If there’s one thing I learned from
over a decade of fighting children
it’s that you should never
underestimate your enemies

(Peach smiles)
My fleet will stay aloft I command
it

PEACH
On the condition that they don’t
violate the airspace of the
Nimbans the last thing you want to
do is piss them off there’s a
strong chance they’1ll just float
away if they feel “disrespected”

BOWSER
(after thinking)

Well put I must admit Princess
collaborating with you
isenlightening Wario will be
hard put to destroy our alliance
especially once Mario and Booster
arrive

CRAIG
It’s nice to have the Koopa Troop
on our side for once King Koopa

BOWSER
There’s that word again “Nice”

A Hammer Brother appears on the steps

HAMMER BROTHER 1
Lieutenant Flutter has arrived
sir and he’s requesting your
orders

BOWSER
Tell him to wait

HAMMER BROTHER 2
(poking his head out from
behind Hammer Brother 1)
We did sir but he said it was
urgent Said the troops are
restless with all these Mushrooms
wanderin’ around

BOWSER
(sighs)
Princess I’m afraid I have
business that needs attending to
You will excuse me

Bowser starts to head down the steps when Peach who’s
looking out over the city calls out to him

PEACH
It’s really beautiful isn’t it
Bowser

BOWSER

(after taking a long
unreadable look at the
Princess)
Of course it is Why else do you
think I’ve been trying so hard to
take it

Peach smiles and Bowser walks out of sight

EXT SARASA LAND - THE DESERT - SUNSET

Luigi and Toad march onward through the desert sweating
They both look exhausted Luigi is still singing a new
song “Flag Pole Sitta” by Harvey Danger a seminal hit from
the 90s

LUIGI

(stumbles singing barely

coherent)
Paranoia paranoia everybody’s
coming to get me just say you
never met meI’m running
underground with the moles

(stumbles gasps in air)
Digging holes
looks up into the sky
blankly then back at
Toad)
Hear the voices in my head I swear
to god they sound like they’re
snoring
(looks back at Toad)
But if you’re bored then you’ re
boring
(lets the next words out

in a kind of scream)
The agony and the irony they’ re
killing me ooooooohhhhhhhhhhh

We go to a long shot of the horizon to show Luigi and Toad
stumbling along in the desert against the brilliant setting
sun

LUIGI
(singing)
I’m not sick but I’m not well

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - CLUB SUGAR

It’s a sleazy club the only one in Crampton and therefore
by definition the worst The sign is a man and a woman
dancing flashing neon but several of the neon sets have
broken making it appear that the man is repeatedly bashing
the woman in the face while she kicks him in the groin

Daisy’s Miata drives up and parks in the mostly empty parking
lot Daisy gets out and looks up at the sign

DAISY
Classy

INT CLUB SUGAR

It’s entirely yellow lit casting everything in shades of
golden matter and black shadow The room is circular sunken
at the middle to create a dance floor where all variety of
grotesques bump and grind to a sound system pumping several
levels too loud

A roller-skating guy with a bright blue afro who looks like
he probably smells like rotten peanut butter is behind the
admittance desk This is JIMMY

JIMMY
(singing along to the
music)
Everybody go get on the floor
everybody walk like a dinosaur
everybody-

Daisy enters and immediately makes a face at the smell

JIMMY
Oh hey there buttercup

Daisy grimaces and flashes her badge

JIMMY

to say was “Good evening Officer”

DAISY

Any idea where he lives

JIMMY
Nah man Who told you he’d be

DAISY
Thanks for your input but they’re
not the sort of people who like to
spend a lot of time with guys like
Quizmo Anyone here know him

JIMMY
Can’t you guys find him with your
like police database or something

DAISY
(peering over Jimmy into
the club)
We don’t have an address for him
all we know is that he’s a New
Jersey resident formerly of
Pequaset South Dakota

One of the guys at the bar sits up He has ratty
hair and is in his mid forties pale eerily calm

mussed red
His

teeth all appear to have been broken the caps cracked and

worn This is CHET RIPPO

CHET
(to Daisy shouting over
the music)
Did you say Pequaset

DAISY
Yeah

CHET
(standing up)
So you’re lookin’ for Chuck

Daisy approaches Chet

DAISY
You know him

CHET
Hey maybe I do maybe I don’t I

ice especially around here

DAISY

CHET

Daisy pulls back her coat a little revealing the butt of her
holstered gun

CHET
(frowns)
Cool down I assure you I have
strictly honorable intentions
Just tryin’ to help

INT CLUB SUGAR - BOOTH

The booth is behind the dance floor and the music is less
abrasive However the cigarette smoke is more than visible
and hovers around and above the patrons forming strange and
sinister shapes that hold together only an instant before
passing back into the thick cloud

Daisy and Chet sit down and Daisy immediately turns
confronting him

DAISY
Make this good
CHET
Hey be cool Ain’t I seen you
somewhere
(hits the side of his
head)

Mario right You’re one of his
friends

Daisy gives a small nod

Nah nothing too bad the guy will

EXT SARASA LAND - THE DESERT - NIGHT

Luigi and Toad wander along aimlessly shivering and then
come over a dune into a clearing A very old looking POKEY
towers over them asleep snoring softly Behind it is a big
red pipe worn and rusted with age But most curious of all
is what lays just to the right of the sleeping Pokey at
first glance it’s just a pile of clothes

But on closer inspection it is revealed to be the skeleton
of an 1800s American cowboy complete with Stetson hat and
six shooter Luigi starts to limp towards it and Toad yanks
him back

LUIGI
Hey

TOAD
That’s a Pokey

LUIGI
(quietly)
Oh yeah
TOAD

They’ re the most vicious animal in
all the kingdoms They eat nothing
but live prey and-

LUIGI
But we could hop that pipe and get
the hell out of here you see that
skeleton It’s human That means
that that pipe goes back to our
world right

TOAD
Maybe it did once but if that
Pokey has nested in it all you’1ll
find inside is certain death froma
thousand tiny mouths

Luigi notices something on the skeleton

LUIGI
That’s a gun

Luigi hops out in front of the dune and scamper-limps across
the sand towards the skeleton and the Pokey

TOAD
(whispering)
What’re you doing Don’t go near
it
LUIGI
(edging closer to the
cowboy skeleton)
Shh

The Pokey stirs a little bit and Luigi freezes The Pokey
snorts and goes back to snoring gently Luigi gets within
two feet and slowly reaches out and pulls the holster belt
off of the skeleton

Moving in near to slow motion he draws out the gun it’s a
Colt Peacemaker lavishly engraved and decorated with gold
and silver swirls He lifts it up looking at it and rolls
out the barrel it’s loaded six shots

It’s beautiful engravings glint in the moonlight and Luigi
puts the barrel back in

LUIGI
(whispers)
Wow
(turning to Toad
whispering)
Hey Toad-

The gun goes off launching a bullet into the sand just in
front of the sleeping Pokey Luigi slowly looks up each
segment of the Pokey’s body until he reaches the head The
big snarling very much awake head He looks to Toad Toad
mouths the words “DON’T MOVE”

Luigi shakily turns his head back to the Pokey which bends
down to him and hisses with a mouth full of hundreds of thin
needle-teeth each of which seems to move on its own Luigi
gulps loudly and the Pokey lunges at him he only barely
manages to dodge it and it dives forward slithering like a
snake Luigi takes off running and Toad joins him with the
Pokey slithering in chase not far behind

LUIGI
Run Run

INT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - MOTEL ROOM

Daisy lays on her bed staring at the ceiling talking on the
phone

DAISY
I don’t know I don’t think he’s
trying to get some if that’s what
youre saying

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
I’m just saying you can never be
too careful

DAISY
I’m supposed to meet him at noon
tomorrow and he’1ll take me to
Quizmo Sounds like a good deal
right

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
Awfully trusting aren’t we

DAISY
This guy is too desperate to be
dangerous he practically begged me
to listen to him

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
He have anything good to say

DAISY

Just that Mario has been in and out
of town apparently he teaches self
defense classes to kids now but
the kids are always very close-
mouthed about it

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
That’s never a good sign

DAISY
Not just that pretty much everyone
but Rippo has been like super
reluctant to talk There are
secrets here I think I might be
getting in way over my head

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
Aw come on you’re the Lieutenant
Nothing’s over your head

Daisy smiles

DAISY
Talk to you tomorrow

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
Hey you better I need to keep up
on the small town drama

DAISY
Remind me why I talk to you about
my relationship problems

ARNIE (ON PHONE)
Oh so they’ re problems

EXT SARASA LAND - THE DESERT - NIGHT
Toad and Luigi lay side by side shivering as Luigi talks

The stars above are incredible and bizarre a giant “aurora
borealis” type glowing streak shimmers high above
LUIGI

(continuing)
So after measurements are made
from the exterior surface of
exterior walls and the middle line
of the interior partitions the
resulting figure is the GLA Gross
Retail Leasable Area

TOAD
(quietly)
Oh Wouldn’t that be GRLA

LUIGI
(after thinking)
Yeah actually it would I never
thought of that
(laughs)
I guess I’ve never liked Real
Estate really

TOAD
But you’ve made money right
Mario says you’re rich in your
world

LUIGI
Being rich and being happy are two
different things Toad

Toad ponders this

TOAD
That gun you found

LUIGI
(glancing at where the six
shooter is holstered on
his hip)
Yeah

TOAD
How many bullets does it carry

LUIGI
Well it had six But then I’m an
idiot and I accidentally wasted
one so now it only has five

TOAD
Hm How are we going to stop Wario
with only five bullets

Silence

LUIGI

I’m thinking we’re going to have to
use them very very carefully

(Toad thinks about this

and Luigi points at the

giant glowing streak in

the sky)
What is that thing I’ve seen it
every night I’ve been here and I
haven’t been bored enough to ask

TOAD
(laughs)
That’s the Celestial Road

LUIGI
What is it A constellation

TOAD

Nah constellations are far away
The Celestial RoadIt’s close
LUIGI
So what is it then Atmospheric
phenomenon
TOAD
(giggles)
No dummy it’s where wishes go
as usual

TOAD
When a Mushroom dies
into twelve spores

it separates

LUIGI
But you did that earlier
you’re not dead

and

TOAD

You caught

can do that

them they j
came I’ve

Freaky

the spores

only humans

If we Mushrooms touch
ust rot Since Mario
died three times

LUIGI

TOAD
Yeah But if we die and no one
tampers which is the custom our
spores float up up up into the air
and join all the others on the
Celestial Road Everyone ends up
up there when they die the Kongs
turn into a swirl of leaves the
Koopas turn into dust the
Kremlings turn into bubbles and so
on and so on That way after we
pass on all of our spirits live
together in peace

LUIGI
(quietly)
Wow
(has a thought)
What about the Goombas Don’t they
just turn into that blue stuff

TOAD
Well yeah but that’s because
they’re born of the earth Their
mana is absorbed back into the
ground and feeds the plants and
the treesSometimes after a
couple of years it just reforms up
into a new Goomba

LUIGI
That’s incredible Your world is
likelike a poem

TOAD
Maybe
(pause)
When a person makes a wish it
floats up and joins the dead and
they grant it

LUIGI
What’s the success rate on that

TOAD
(giggles)
Like one in a million

LUIGI
Good

TOAD
Why good

LUIGI
I was worried you guys got better
odds on wishes than we did back
home

Toad cracks up and Luigi smiles

TOAD
(recovering)
I just wanna know what you’re gonna
sing tomorrow

I don’t know man I’ve already
gone through half the alt-rock hits

Wario’s armies creep through the forest the tanks doing
their best to be stealthy the helicopters flying high

Mario creeps along jumping from tree to tree He stops ina
strange palm-like tree and reaches inside a knot hole He
pulls out a dozen glowing fireflowers

Mario grins and looks down into the troops and sees a
purple shape weaving in and out between the Shy-Guys it’s
CROCO He looks scared amongst the Shy-Guys and very out
of place

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - ALLEY WAY - MORNING

Chet talks to Daisy as they walk down the alley which is
twisted and curved red bricks grayed over time

CHET
It’s right down here

DAISY
Need I remind you that if you’re
screwing with me-

CHET
Jeez Learn to trust a guy a
little

He smiles his broken toothed smile They reach a door that
seems a size too small with “CHARLES P QUIZMO PRIVATE EYE”
painted somewhat hastily on the glass window

CHET
See what’d I tell you

DAISY
Do we knock or just go in

CHET
You’ re the boss

Daisy opens the door and a mounted fish falls out of the
room into the alley Daisy and Chet both look at it and
Chet shrugs They go in

INT QUIZMO’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

It looks more like crowded pawn shop than a gumshoe’s office
everything has something stacked on top of it leaving a very
narrow path to a desk at the other side of the room

Fishing poles are stacked on top of antique lamps on top of
board games on top of taxidermied animals of questionable
species (among them is a “jackalope”) stacked on top of books
about everything from the occult to Elvis stacked on top of
bent troops of miniature army-men set up on the filthy green-
shag carpet

From behind all the junk stacked to the ceiling we can hear
the clack-clack-clack of an old-fashioned type-writer Daisy
crinkles her nose and tries to look over all the junk to get
a look at the desk but can’t She nods at Chet

CHET
(loudly shouting over the
type writer)
Chuck It’s Chet

QUIZMO (0OS)
Yeah sure Chet come on in

Daisy and Chet go in with Daisy daintily ducking under a
hanging fish-hook

They go around the stacked boxes of files and see Chuck
QUIZMO in all of his dubious glory He’s short

almost impossibly so and his absurdly curly hair is barely
held down under a top hat with his eccentric style of dress
he almost looks like a middle-aged poverty stricken Willy
Wonka

Behind his desk is a giant cork-board on which are tacked
dozens of news-clippings from primarily local but also a few
national papers A few of them catch the eye SEARCH FOR

I’m just a sweet-

There’s the faint sound of a propeller plane and Luigi’s
eyes go wide

LUIGI

Toad

TOAD
(groggy out of it)
Yuh

LUIGI
Did you hear that

TOAD
Hear what

LUIGI

I thought heard
(shakes his head)

Nothing Never mind

Vrooooocom We get a glimpse of some kind of very large
propeller plane as it whizzes over high above heading South

East

LUIGI

Oh My God
TOAD
(terrified)

WHAT THE SHMECK IS THAT

LUIGI
(quietly)
It’s an airplane
(his morale boosted)
It’s a freaking airplane Come on

Luigi sweeps Toad up into his arms and begins taking massive
leaps and bounds across the desert chasing the plane as it
vanishes into the horizon

He makes three leaps when he’s very suddenly hit by a huge
weighted net causing him to crash to the sand his face
squished uncomfortably against Toad’s He looks up and sees
a Ninjii

NINJII 1

(assuming a karate pose)
KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

LUIGI

Great Just great

The Ninjii jumps and karate-kicks Luigi right between the
eyes and everything goes black

EXT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - EVENING

Chuck is already waiting outside looking around somewhat
nervous Daisy’s Miata drives up and Chet gets out first
slapping the hood in excitement Daisy gets out slowly
measuring each step

QUIZMO

(stepping forward)
Look I’m gonna tell you again I
don’t know exactly what’s down
there-

DAISY
(going up the pathway)
We’1l find out then won’t we

QUIZMO
Right

CHET
You need me to pick the lock

DAISY
(breezing through the
door)
It’s open

INT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Daisy takes four steps and freezes to the spot Chet and
Quizmo inch in behind her

CHET
What’s up Detective

DAISY
I’ve been in this house more times
than I can count And I have never
seen it clean

Daisy sniffs the air

DAISY
You smell that

CHET
(sniffs)
What

QUI ZMO
Gas and sawdust

DAISY
A workshop
(nods to a door)
In the garage That’s our first
stop

INT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - GARAGE WORKSHOP

It’s dark and then the door creaks open casting light onto
a large piece of Koopa Shell Daisy flicks on the lights
and they flicker to life yellow and dull revealing what
looks to be a fully functional craftsman’s workshop tools
line the walls the ground is corrugated steel and several
larger machines are spread throughout the room which is
surprisingly big

Over in the corner is a table on which sits a huge rack of
test tubes a tube filled with blue glop is marked “GOOMBA”
a tube with swirling purple dust is marked “KOOPA” a single
Mushroom Person Spore in a glass case is marked “TOADOFSKY -
3”

Mario has at least three different projects going on the
largest of which is the afore mentioned Koopa shell piece
which he’s been doing tests on Quizmo stays near the door
but Chet and Daisy are intrigued They start exploring the
room immediately with Chet going over to the shell

CHET

Check this out like it’s from a
giant turtle

(lifts a clipboard hanging

next to it and reads

aloud)
“March twenty fifth I still can’t
find any reaction to heat no
matter what the intensity even the
blow torch can’t put a scratch in
it which explains the resistance
to fire balls Tomorrow I’m going
to try small caliber bullets”

Chet reaches down and picks up a spent 45 shell off the
floor

CHET (CONT’D)
Looks like he didn’t have much luck
with that either

DAISY
(wandering absent-
mindedly)

What is he talking about
fireballs What does he-

Daisy bumps into something off-screen turns and screams her
hand immediately going to her gun We smash cut to what
appears to be a dog-sized spider-monster laying on a table
clearly long dead having already been dissected Various
organs float in preservative jars all around the corpse
marked “TATANGA - LIVER()” “TATANGA - HEART ()” and so
on

DAISY
(pointing numbly looking
to Quizmo)
What the hell is that thing

After a pause Quizmo shrugs

QUIZMO
I dunno maybe one of those mutants
from the pollution from the paint
factory Remember that two headed
dog Chet

CHET
(quietly)
That ain’t from the paint factory
Charlie That thing is just
(nods a little)
Freaky

DAISY

from Tatanga)
I’m-

She stumbles a little and then stops

DAISY
Huh

CHET
(in full on side-kick
mode)
What

Daisy stomps a couple times

DAISY
This floor is new It’s built over
something Look for a trap door

Daisy and Chet search around the messy floor and Chuck looks
downright scared now

CHUCK
That’s probably the basement I’m
not sure we should-

CHET
(grabbing a finger loop on
a hatch on the floor)
Got it

Daisy goes over and yanks the trap door open Beneath is
only darkness Daisy reaches in feels around and flips a
switch Yellowed lights fade on and Daisy looks to Chet

CHET
I’ll go in first-

DAISY
(pushing him out of the
way)
In your dreams Chet Quizmo
you’re on point

QUIZMO
What Why me

DAISY
I was under the impression you knew
what was down here

QUIZMO
Well I mean I have a vague
impression but-

DAISY
Good enough for me

INT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - THE LAB

Chuck climbs down the wooden ladder in the center of the
room and looks around At first he can’t see much he
stands alone in the fading yellow lights and sees a
lightbulb hanging down from the ceiling by a cord

He reaches out hesitantly and pulls a cord and very suddenly
dozens of fluorescent lights all over the room light up

t looks like the lair of a mad scientist from a 1950s B-
Movie right down to the big levers on the wall and the
electricity arking Jacob’s Ladder over in the corner

The most dominant feature of the room is what looks to be
some sort of solid-wall cage or holding cell It sits in
southeast area of the room lined by tables covered in
computers microscopes and various experimental testing
equipment

A single thin viewingfood slot is the only opening in the
cage (which really looks more like a large safe or a small
vault) A second simpler holding cell lined only by thin
bars (bent in several places) is at the other end of the
room it’s been ravaged with torn up stuffed animals deep
scratch marks in the wall and several smears of blood on the
floor walls and ceiling

A refrigerator sits over in the corner with a bikini
centerfold hanging off it it’s the same fridge from the
beginning which held solely Heineken and chocolate pudding

QUI ZMO
(calling up to Daisy)
It’s all clear down here
(looks around)
Weird but clear

Daisy jumps down and looks around Chet climbs down after
her

DAISY
Deeper down the rabbit hole

Chet laughs and hums the Twilight Zone theme and they split
out Daisy goes over to the fridge and Chet looks at all
the weird machinery then looks at the holding cell

CHET
MaybeMaybe he got taken over

Daisy looks at a list held to the fridge by a magnet just
like the one in the beginning 1 GROCERIES 2 FINISH
DOCTORAL THESIS 3 ANALYZE BEAN KINGDOM WATER WITH
RADIOMETER 4 CALL LUIGI 5 SAVE WORLD All are scratched
off except for “SAVE WORLD” Daisy blinks

DAISY
Taken over

CHET
Yeah you know like body
snatchers Aliens

Daisy opens the fridge and looks in Heinekens and chocolate
pudding

DAISY
Nope Same guy
(closes the fridge and
nods at the holding cell)
What happened over there

CHET

I dunno I’m guessing Mario
gotsomething and put it in
here

(points to the simple

pleasant destroyed cell)
And that didn’t work out So he
put it in there

Chet nods at the containment cell Daisy and Chet approach

it as Quizmo shifts nervously from his place at the base of
the ladder Daisy looks over the desk a book called “THE
MIND OF THE PSYCHOTIC” sits on top of a book called “THE
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE GREATER APES” which is next to a badly dog-
eared copy of “ADVANCED CULT PSYCHOLOGY”

Chet peers into the slot of cage box but sees nothing
Daisy picks up a clipboard and reads to herself

MARIO (VO)
He doesn’t eat He doesn’t sleep
I must’ve tried to talk to hima
hundred times and all he does is
snarl and try to kill me I keep
telling him I don’t want to hurt
him but he either doesn’t
understand doesn’t believe me or
just doesn’t care These things
have a bloodlust unlike anything
I’ve ever seen

Daisy notices something in a specimen pan on the desk hidden
under a sheet of red fabric Chet continues to poke at the
cage-box and something rustles inside making a noise that
sounds very human

CHET
(quietly)
What the hell

Chet unlocks the dead-bolt and opens the cell inside there
is only darkness Chet leans in a little looking around
Daisy moves the fabric off of the specimen pan revealing the
badly cracked mask of a Shy-Guy

DAISY
Hey Chet-

And then so suddenly it takes us a moment to realize what’s
going on something leaps out of the cage with a terrible
scream It pounces onto Chet tearing at his face

Quizmo draws his 45 but the creature sees him leaps across
he room knocks the gun out of his hands and punches him in
he face It grabs him by the neck as he falls and begins
eating his head against the floor and then Daisy grabs the
hing in a full nelson and we realize what it is a Shy-Guy
inus robe and mask

Bdtodd

t hisses and kicks her in the gut with one of its thin legs
ts toe-talons cutting her stomach and sending her crashing
nto a stack of something which collapses down onto her
het proving himself useful grabs it by the neck and
punches it in the face it barely reacts screaming with it’s
misshappen mouth

QHEH

CHET
(holding his bloodied
face)
Holy sh-

The Shy-Guy punches him three times and he stumbles into
some lab equipment The Shy-Guy grabs a scalpel off a table
and takes some swings at Quizmo as he tries to get his gun
Quizmo lifts a chair lion-tamer style trying to fend off the
attack The Shy-Guy leaps up onto the chair and Quizmo
hurls it away too late the Shy-Guy has crawled onto him
and bites him twice on the forehead

Daisy yanks it off and punches it several times knocking it

to the ground face down She straddles it and tries to put

handcuffs on it but it does something genuinely bizarre it

pops every joint in its body and reverses itself turning its
back into its front and vice versa

DAISY
Aw crap

The Shy-Guy hooks its feet into her armpits and flings her
off but Chet tackles it before it can continue its offense
It wraps its arm around his neck like tentacles it either
has joints every two inches or no bones at all Chet gags
but then Daisy kicks the Shy-Guy in the back knocking it off
of Chet and face first into the wall

Daisy takes out her gun One glance reveals it’s not your
average police pistol it’s the gray version of The Duck Hunt
Zapper (sold with the Original Nintendo)

DAISY
(somewhere between
terrified and furious)
Put down the scalpel and put your
hands behind your-

The Shy-Guy turns at her and hisses giving her a really good
look at its distorted hideous face

DAISY
(quietly)
Okay

The Shy-Guy pounces at her limbs flailing and she fires
twice hitting it both times shattering it apart The
pieces land on the floor and start to dissolve with a
chemical fizz

Everyone takes a moment to breath Daisy stares at the

fizzing pieces of the Shy-Guy and then looks up at Quizmo
Quizmo’s eyes widen and he practically leaps up the ladder
Daisy in hot pursuit

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE -

Quizmo runs out the front door but Daisy grabs him by his
collar swings him around twice and slams him against the
side of the house

holding a hand towel to
the cuts on his face)
Yipes

QUIZMO
(terrified)
I didn’t know I didn’t-

DAISY
(furious)
What the hell was that thing

Daisy slams Quizmo against the side of the house again

QUIZMO

it at Quizmo’s head)
I WANT SOME GODDAMN ANSWERS RIGHT
NOW QUIZMO OR-

Chet grabs Daisy from behind and they struggle

CHET
(trying to help)
Detective Put the gun away

DAISY
Get offa me

Daisy judo-flips Chet onto the lawn and then grabs Quizmo as
he tries to make a break for it and German-Suplexes him to
the ground She stands up takes some slow deep breaths
and puts her gun away

DAISY
(quietly fixing her hair)
Thanks Chet

himself to his feet)

EXT SARASALAND - NINJII ENCAMPMENT - PIT - SUNSET

Luigi lays in a ten foot deep thirty foot wide pit dug in
the sand unconscious He stirs groggy and then stands
stumbling a bit most of the pit is shrouded in shadow and
his already blurry vision is having some trouble adjusting

TOAD
(from the top of the pit)
Luigi

LUIGI

(groggy)
Toad

Luigi looks up and sees that the top of the pit is lined by

dozens and dozens of Ninjii several of whom hold Toad who’s
hands have been bound

LUIGI

(groggy)
What the hell is all this

MOUSER (0OS)
He awakens Let the combat begin

LUIGI
(muttering to himself)
I remember a karate starfish

A Ninjii hits a gong

LUIGI
(rubbing his eyes)
Ah Loud
(mutters again still very
much out of it)
FreakingstarfishGong What

TOAD
Behind you

LUIGI
Behi-

A tiny bomb about the size of a tennis ball flies in from
over Luigi’s head and explodes just in front of him ina
tiny burst of fire sending him flipping over backwards
Halfway through the flip MOUSER comes leaping into frame
bicycle kicking Luigi several times in the back before
jumping back into the shadows

LUIGI
(after landing hard face
down in the sand)
Ooh That woke me up

TOAD
His name is Mouser he thinks we
were sent to kill him

LUIGI
What’s he doing

Mouser comes rushing by and dropkicks Luigi in the head
spinning him around

TOAD
(quietly)
Well I thought that was kind of
obvious

Luigi half-leaps half-stumbles to his feet and two bombs
explode on either side of his head knocking him forward

Blood trickles out of his ears and we hear the whispering
whining tone of damage eardrums

Luigi groans and touches his head forcing himself to his
feet just in time for Mouser to blur by and claw him across
the face twice before tail-whipping him and throwing him to
the ground The Ninjii golf-clap and Luigi stands up
completely frazzled and takes some wild swipes at the air

A bomb very suddenly goes off just between Luigi’s shoulder
blades knocking him down Mouser flits by and kicks him in
the head then vanishes into the darkness of the caves once
more Luigi struggles to his feet and takes some futile
swings at nothing and Mouser whips by again clawing Luigi’s
forehead

MOUSER
(laughing)
You’ re slower than a Spiny human

Luigi spins dazed wiping the blood out of his eyes and
another little bomb goes off next to his head knocking him
into the sand Mouser whizzes past him again clawing him
across the chest

TOAD
(shouting)
Focus Luigi You have to focus

Luigi clutches the scratches and stops listening focusing
The world around him seems to slow down His eyes look left
and we see a bomb flying in at a surreally slow speed over
his left shoulder Time resumes normality and Luigi spins
and volley-ball spikes the bomb back at Mouser who yelps

The bomb nails him in the chest the subsequent explosion
knocking him flat He staggers to his feet and Luigi
hammers him in the top of the head knocking him so hard that
sand poofs up all around him as he hits the ground Mouser
slowly rolls over moaning and Luigi grabs him by the throat
and cocks back a fist

LUIGI
Game over

MOUSER
(yelping)
I give up I surrender

LUIGI
Toad

Toad flips one of his Ninjii captors punch-kick-throw combos
another and leaps down into the pit with Luigi watching his
back

MOUSER
(wiping his face)
WhoWho are you

Mouser straightening his
over-all straps)

Isn’t it obvious rat guy
(the setting sun frames
him and he pulls on his
“L” cap)

I’m Super Luigi

INT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - THE VOIR DIRE

It’s a bar a smoky sad place archetypal of bars of its
ilk But like everything else in Crampton everything is
just a little bit off a little bit crooked Most notable is
the shape of the bar itself it’s warped and bent not
drastically but just enough to pull at your eyes a little

There’s an Revolutionary War musket above the door but it
hangs at an awkward angle the actual barrel is bent to the
side so that the gun points directly at the barstools

Dingy and long ago rotted trophy-taxidermies cover the walls
all the way down to the ground where they’ re worn and
covered in mud and dust

Daisy and Chet sit on either side of Chuck who looks shaken
There’s a long pause and Chuck sets down his beer staring
at it

QUI ZMO
(thoughtful slowly)

Some secrets aren’t meant to be
told to everybody Some secrets
are meant for one or two people
and that’s it everyone else just
has to back away and try to forget
about it

grimaces)

EXT THE WOODS - WARIO ENCAMPMENT

Dozens of Shy-Guys sit around on dozens of parked tanks in a
forest “clearing” “clearing” in the sense that the tank
treads have quite literally flattened all of the trees and
foliage The Shy-Guys are picking at pieces of raw meat and
one of them accidentally shoots another

Croco sits nervously in the crowd looking unhappy and
scared clutching his top-hat to his chest

A piece of raw meat drops in front of him and a Shy-Guy
scrambles up and hisses at Croco Croco talks in the manner
of a 1930s gangster for reasons unknown and hisses his s’s

CROCO
(shoving the meat towards
the Shy-Guy)
Take it It’s yours I don’t want
it

A white gloved hand comes out of the jungle behind Croco and
taps him on the shoulder

Croco turns and is yanked into the forest through the
bushes cracks his way through several branches and then is
slammed into a tree Mario holds him there by his shoulders
and Croco starts shivering convulsively in fear

CROCO
(loudly afraid)
Mar-

Mario clamps his hand over Croco’s mouth and puts a finger
to his lips He slowly takes his hand away

MARIO
You’ve got exactly one minute
before I start throwing punches

CROCO
(whispering quickly)
Listen Mario seriously you don’t
want to hurt little old me Croco
your friend your buddy your
willing slave

What’re you doing with these slime
bags I always thought you were
classier than this

CROCO

Hey a Crokie’s gotsta do what a

Wario’s a murderer Croco a cold
blooded psychopath

(drops Croco)

I knew you were a scoundrel but a
killer

CROCO
ain’t killed nobody I just help
Wario with the maps

MARIO
You might as well be pulling the
trigger Croco
(theatrical)
And to think I once thought you
could be the man to unite the
Crokies

CROCO
I was Iam I was misled I was
manipulated I was gooned Mario
give me another chanse Don’t be
angry

MARIO
I’m not angry
(rubbing it in)
I’m disappointed

CROCO

(grovelling fidgeting

with his hat)
Please Mario please

(gestures)
He came into Monstro Town and said
everyone who didn’t join him was
dead

MARIO
(squinting at Croco)
I haven’t heard of an attack on
Monstro-

CROCO

It wass a trick A bluff A
double-cros He got whoever was
dumb enough to go with him and beat
feet

MARIO
Because he was afraid of Booster

CROCO
I don’t know maybe

MARIO
And you were one of the folks dumb
enough to sign up with him

CROCO

I was afraid for my life strictly
self preservashun Haven’t you
seen those things he has

(imitates)
Ratatatatatata-tat Ain’t nothing
anyone in the Kingdoms can do
against that He recruited a whole
bunch of us Katsini Belome Jonny
Jones-

MARIO
Youre aware the Kingdoms have
united

CROCO

That’s what Wario told us yeah

MARIO
Then you’re aware that the battle
for Mushroom City won’t go quickly

CROCO
What’re you playin’ at

MARIO
I’m asking you if maybe you’d like
to reconsider your allegiances
prior to arrival at the walls of
the city

CROCO
The way I see it I die either way
Wario wants to destroy everything
and the shy-Guys they love him
They’11 do anything he says

MARIO
Do you have any idea how he
controls them

CROCO

(happy that the

conversation has become

less confrontational)
He met them out in the desert he
led them out into the world into
your world And he gave them
things candies toys-

MARIO
He bribes them

CROCO
Yes but it’s more than that He’s
like a god to them they worship
him They were too stupid to get
out of the deserts by themselves
so the dupess think he’s some kind
of genius

MARIO
(reverent)
Like an evil greasy Moses

CROCO
Huh

MARIO
Here’s what we’re going to do
Croco you’re going to leave this
group and wiggle your tail back to
Mushroom City

CROCO
When

MARIO
Now Tonight As soon as we’re
done talking

CROCO
But I’m a wanted man They’1l
arrest me

MARIO
I don’t care All you need to do
is get the word to the Princess
that Wario has helicopters

CROCO
They’ 11-

MARIO

Just scream it as soon as you get
through the gates Scream it all
the way to your goddamn cell it’1l
get to her trust me He’s relying
on the choppers as his ace in the
hole if we can take that away from
him we might have a chance

CROCO
How’m I supposed to get to the
Mushroom Kingdom from here

MARIO
Thirty paces or so back that way

there’s a Yellow Pipe to the Lesser
Mushroom Network

CROCO
But Mario I don’t know how to usse-

MARIO

(frustrated getting in

Croco’s face again

showing the strange

“Great Man” quality he’s

taken on since going into

the Mushroom Kingdom)
Don’t play with me Croco I know
damn well that you used to use the
LMN back in your smuggling days
and I somehow doubt you’ve managed
to forget

Croco presses himself into the tree scared he knows what he
should do but initiative to do it is lacking Terrified
apathy is winning out

MARIO
(quieting down taking off
his hat mirroring
Croco’s stance)
Please Croco Lives are at stake

Croco emptily stares at Mario thinking

CROCO
It’ll take time maybe ten hours
maybe more there are nine
transfers from here to Mushroom
sity and it’s easy to get lost-

MARIO
(completely sincere)
I have faith in you You are my
man in this understood

CROCO
I can make it

MARIO
(smiles)
You can make it

CROCO
What are you going to do

MARIO
I’m going to see Bertha

CROCO
The Big B You’re gonna try to get
her on your side

(MORE)

CROCO (contd)
(Mario nods looking out
into the Shy-Guy
Clearing)
How’ re you gonna convin-sss her

MARIO
(solemn)
I can’t tell you that for reasons
that are secret
(leans in close to Croco)
And sexy

Croco nods completely baffled Mario smiles and then his
face goes blank

MARIO
Go

Croco pulls on his top hat finally looking completely in
control and darts into the woods Mario watches him go and
then bounces up to the top of a tree impossibly balanced
He looks up at the giant half-moon hanging in the sky and
sighs

MARIO
(breaking down a little)
I should never have brought you
here little brother

EXT SARASALAND - NINJII ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

It’s a simple circle of well built adobes sitting in a dirt
oasis in the desert The night is mostly pitch black but
dozens of torches have been lit around the largest adobe
where around one hundred Ninjiis have crowded trying to get
a peek inside

INT SARASALAND - NINJII ENCAMPMENT - MOUSER’S ADOBE -
CONTINUOUS

Toad and Luigi sit positively gorging themselves on all
varieties of strange food without regard for the sanitary
conditions of the soft orange adobe room around them or even
their own clothing they’ve been in a desert for three days
minus food and water and it shows

We pan around to reveal the Ninjiis pressed against the
windows and Mouser sitting nervously at the other side of
the table his nose twitching and wiggling as he struggles to
think of something to say When he does speak it’s ina
thick upper-crust British accent

MOUSER
(starting too quickly)
Please understand there was no way
we could’ve known that you weren’t
sent by Wario

TOAD
(through mouthfuls of
food)
Mm

Luigi picks up a strange fizzy drink to wash down something
gelatinous and purple

MOUSER
We really do have the greatest
respect for your brother and all
his accomplishments

LUIGI
(through mouthfuls of
food)
Mhm

MOUSER
(a little perturbed by the
lack of response)
Shall I make this address at
another time admit to feeling
most impolite interrupting your-

Luigi continues chugging down the fizzy drinks spilling all
over himself but gestures to Mouser to continue

MOUSER
(wiping some of the drink
that’s splashed onto him
out of his fur)
Right-o
(continues his address as
planned)
I can only hope that our
hospitality can make up for our
earlierindiscretions

LUIGI
(swallowing)
Are you Booster

MOUSER
(a little confused)
No
Toad punches Luigi in the arm

TOAD
I could’ve told you that His name
is Althorp Mouser

MOUSER
Lord Althorp Mouser

LUIGI
(to Toad)
Well how was I supposed to know
that you could’ve told me that

TOAD
Back in the pit you should’ve said
“Ts this Booster” And then I
would’ve said “No” Now we look
like total gehflecks

LUIGI

We don’t look like gehflecks
TOAD

We look like total gehflecks
MOUSER

Well I don’t think you look like

gehflecks
Luigi looks at Toad and gestures at Mouser “See”

TOAD
He’s just being nice We look like
gehflecks

LUIGI
(after a pause)
Wait what the hell is a gehfleck

TOAD
(genuinely)
What you just did Asking me what
a gehfleck was
(points at Luigi)
You’re being a gehfleck

Luigi makes a face at Toad who makes a face back
this several times and then Mouser speaks up

They do

MOUSER

Again not to impose or assert
myself in an inappropriate manner
but may I ask what you were doing
in the deserts You seem to have
come

(wiggles his nose)
Ill prepared

LUIGI
We were on an airship
(shoves another purple
jello glob in his mouth)
We were attacked and it crashed

MOUSER
An airship One of King Koopa’s
LUIGI
No An airship of the Mushroom
Empire
TOAD

(quietly impressed)
Nice save

MOUSER

(making a rat-face of

extreme suspicion)
The Mushroom Empire fell five
hundred years ago Listen up old
boy I’ve been out in the desert
quite some time but my head isn’t
filled with sand You can’t-

LUIGI
The Mushroom Empire has reformed
Koopa Nimban Kong Kremling and
Molemite forces are working side by
side in Mushroom City as we speak

MOUSER
(still dubious)
Why would Koopa ever throw in his
lot with the Mushrooms

LUIGI
Wario plans to attack the city and
hasn’t been shy about it If the
Mushroom city falls his next
target would be the
uhKoopaplace
TOAD
(whispers)
oopa Rock

LUIGI
oopa Rock

MOUSER
(thinks)
Unusually reasonable of Bowser
isn’t it

LUIGI
I wouldn’t know I’ve only been
here for about a week

Mouser chuckles

MOUSER
If that’s true good show on
knowing the lay of the land The
first time I met Mario he kept
confusing Goombas with Koopas So
you’re what then here to recruit
me and my men

LUIGI
(setting down his cup)
Actually when we were shot down
we were trying to contact Booster

MOUSER

(disappointed his nose

twitching)
Er-hm Well you’re more than
welcome to stay in the encampment
for as long as you need I can
direct you towards Booster in the
morning

Toad kicks Luigi under the table

LUIGI
But if you want to come and fight
WarioI mean if you’re willing

MOUSER
(very suddenly brightening
up)
Anything to get back in good graces
with the King sir a return to the
Mushroom Kingdom would be glorious

LUIGI
(hesitant)
What’d you do to get out of good
graces with the King

MOUSER
(ashamed trying to tone
it down)
Well uh we had a bit of a tiff-

TOAD
He’s was a radical he tried to
stage a coup Take over the whole
Kingdom

MOUSER
(interjecting)
Peacefully I wanted to do it
peacefully

TOAD
He was exiled to the desert and no
one ever heard from him again

MOUSER
Well pardon me for taking issue
with the idea of a powerful kingdom
being ruled by
(twitches his nose)
Children

Luigi looks at Mouser for a time

LUIGI
Fair enough

MOUSER
Eh

LUIGI

I don’t blame you I mean hell
I’d be nervous about it too And
youve been out here ever since

MOUSER
The Ninjiis are a kindly people
They’ve taken me as they’re leader

TOAD
(suspicious)
How’d that work out

MOUSER

(laughing haughtily)
Their leader is whoever is the best
in singles combat I won the
position granted I tried several
times to give it back to one of the
elders but they wouldn’t have any
of that

LUIGI
(after a moment’s thought)
How long ago were you cast out

TOAD
(answering before Mouser
can)
Twelve years ago

Mouser bows his head

LUIGI
Well
(wipes his mouth)
I think twelve years is long
enough don’t you

Mouser smiles widely

INT SARASALAND - NINJII ENCAMPMENT - OTHER ADOBE - LATER

Toad and Luigi lay in little fungus-pit beds parrallel-head-
to-head with each other Luigi mumbles to himself and Toad
snaps his chubby little mushroom fingers

TOAD
The air-plane

LUIGI
Huh

TOAD

You forgot to ask him about the
schmecking airplane

Luigi begins pounding his head on the floor in frustration

INT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - VOIR DIRE

Daisy and Chet sit at the bar both a little drunk now
Daisy watches a miniature whirl-pool form in her drink and
Chet watches her more out of curiosity than anything else

CHET
So what’s our theory

DAISY
About what

CHET
About Mario about the town about
everything
(grimaces)
Where do we stand

DAISY
We standNowhere

CHET
What Why

DAISY

Because we don’t stand with
Mushrooms and turtles my friend
I pretty much refuse to stand with
the Mushrooms and the turtles and
the alternate dimensions for that
matter

(holds out her mug for a

refill)
Tomorrow morning I’m going back up
to New York I’m going back to my
apartment and I’m sleeping

CHET
(bewildered)
Sleeping

DAISY
(confidentially)
You know I haven’t slept since I
got to this godforsaken town
(Chet reacts)
Yeah

Chet looks at the bar for a moment before looking up at
Daisy who had started arranging trail-mix into a yin-yang
formation

CHET
Why’d you do it
(Daisy looks at him and
makes a “What the hell
are you talking about”
face)
(MORE)

CHET (contd)
Why’d you dump Luigi in the first
place
(Daisy groans)
I mean if you were just going to
come looking for him-

DAISY
I didn’t know I was going to come
looking for him when I dumped him
okay
(stops)
And I didn’t dump him I said I
needed time

CHET
Why did you need time

DAISY
Why do yoooouuuuu want to
knoooocowww

CHET
Hey I’ve told you before I’m
curious

DAISY
(stares at her beer)
I’ll trade you I’11 tell you what
happened with Luigi if you tell me
what happened to your teeth

CHET
(after pausing)
Done

DAISY
That easy huh

CHET
I’m a simple man When I was
eleven we lived with my grandma
I had dyslexia Fix-O-Dent denture
glue looked a lot to me like
Colgate Minty White Tooth Paste
and by the time I realized what had
happened I was too panicked to
think things through so I just
grabbed a screwdriver and

Daisy looks horrified

CHET
Hey you wanted to know Fair
trade

(MORE)
CHET (contd)
(leans forward)
The Luigi I remember was a pretty
straight-laced guy You seemI
don’t know you seem too tough for
him

DAISY

(drunk)
Ha

(mopes)
Being “tough” was never the
problem Luigi was just
(looks off into the
distance at nothing)
Boring NoHe wasn’t boring He
was bored It was like everything
he did wasn’t enough for him he
and his brother were like flip
sides of the same coin ever since
they were kids Mario would stay
home and drink Luigi would go out
and join a club Mario would sit
on his ass and stare at the wall
Luigi would do extra-credit
projects

(sips her drink)
They were doing opposites but they
were both doing the same
thingTrying to avoid something
or maybe find it I don’t know It
was like they didn’t have goals or
maybe that they did have goals but
their goals were just too big So
while Mario just kind of gave up
Luigi over-achieved But neither
of them found what they were
looking for
(sighs)
It started to grate on me after a
while I felt like maybe Luigi was
bored with me I felt like when he
finally found what he was looking
for I wouldn’t be part of it and
that scared the crap out of me

nq

CHET
SoWhere do you think he is

DAISY
I thinkI think he and his
brother finally found what they
were looking for

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - SODA LAKE

Soda Lake is somewhat surprisingly not made of bubbling
carbonated water Instead it’s remarkably serene one of
the most beautiful places we’ve seen in the Mushroom Kingdom

The lake itself is big if not gigantic you can see one side
from the other entirely lined with some sort of crazy
cartoon elm trees save a small beach at the south end
complete with a rustic dock at the end of which sits a
little boat Fern bushes and hanging vines cover most of the
shores giving it a vaguely Mediterranean feel a cross
between the lakes of the American North-East and rivers of
the Amazon

There are two rivers branching out of the lake one going
south and the other going northwest An enormous waterfall
is a couple miles downstream but there’s a calm area without
current between the main body of the lake and the torrents of
the waterfall

Both the Butter Bridge and The Cheese Bridge are visible high
above linking the two mountains on the horizon and Cookie
Mountain towers up and slightly to the right in the
distance curving in a way mountains here on Earth find
impolite

And completely impossible the thing is practically a free-
standing spiral Mario is strolling along the beach
whistling and occasionally picking up a rock and throwing it
exactly ten feet in front of him

MARIO
Here Cheep-Cheep-CheepHere
Cheep-Cheep-Cheep

He throws the rock again and looks out over the water then
grunts and starts walking to the rock

MARIO
(quietly impatient)
Come on what’s the hold up
(picks up the rock)
Here Cheep-Cheep-Cheep

He throws the rock but it only gets five feet before
something comes sailing up out of the water and plucks it out
of the air Mario dives and grabs the thing before it can
hit the beach He rolls as the thing struggles and then
sits up revealing the thing to be a CHEEP-CHEEP It snaps
and grunts and hisses spitting out pieces of the rock

MARIO
(struggling a little with
the Cheep-Cheep)
What took you so long

The Cheep-Cheep speaks in a hissing hateful rasp

CHEEP-CHEEP
Get offa me dirt-walker

MARIO
Call Bertha

CHEEP-CHEEP

Forget it I ain’t doing nothing
for you

MARIO
All right Then you and I will

just sit out here for a while and
admire the view

The Cheep-Cheep hisses and struggles for about fifteen more
seconds and then grunts and sighs

MARIO
Come on

The Cheep-Cheep hisses and then gasps a couple times

MARIO
Cooooooome on

The Cheep-Cheep sighs in defeat and then makes and odd
dolphin-like sound and Mario smiles

MARIO
See That was eas-

Dozens of Cheep-Cheeps come flying up out of the water at
Mario biting onto his legs arms and torso He stumbles
swinging his arms shouting and cursing He backflips
throwing some of the Cheep-Cheeps off him then drops and
rolls crushing some of them (when Cheep-Cheeps die they
turn into crumpled balls of paper)

Mario swats a larger one into the sky sticks his hand down
one’s throat grabs something and turns it inside out and
finally gets up and kicks one so hard it bursts in half
before two more hit him in the shoulders and knock him face
first down into the surf

He flings them both off and then looks up into an enormous
pair of lips it’s BIG BERTHA She’s mostly out of the
water her huge body rocking slightly in the waves Mario
straightens chuckling nervously

MARIO
BerthaWhy such a hostile
reception

The giant fish stares at him unamused

MARIO
Aw come on baby
(does a cutesy-Italian
accent)
It’sa me Mario

Bertha grunts

MARIO
Bertha talk to me
(reaches out and pulls a
seashell out of her
eyelashes)
I’m trying to be a friend here

As she talks she sounds like a combination of Aretha
Franklin Miss Piggy and a Tyrannosaurus Rex

BERTHA
(snarling)
You stood me up

MARIO
(confused)
Stood you up
(quickly)
Oh yeah uh
(takes off his hat)
got sick

BERTHA

Sick my fin I heard the stories
bout you cavorting with that blonde
harlot of a princess I even heard
a rumor you two were married

MARIO

Bertha
(thinks then tries a
different tact)

It’s true It’s all true

Bertha sobs

MARIO
But what we have is special I
could never love her the way I love
you
(looks down)
You mean the world to me Bertha

All is well Bertha is overjoyed

BERTHA
Oh Mario my little marshmallow
puppy c’mere and give Big Bertha a
kiss

Mario goes to Bertha forcibly puckers her huge lips with his
hands kisses them and pulls away a long cobweb of slime
still connecting them ario notices and frantically swats
it away then tries to act nonchalant when Bertha opens her

eyes

MARIO
BerthaI need your help with
something

BERTHA
(grunts)
It figures

MARIO
Nothing huge just-

BERTHA
Just a little something I know

(she turns and starts

slowly paddling up the

beach Mario following

along)
I heard it all before Mario You
need a favor you need me to tell
the so-and-sos blah blah blah you
need me to show you the way to the
Forest Of Illusion you need me to
ferry you across the ocean-

MARIO
We had fun on the ocean trip
BERTHA
Mario you ain’t listenin’
(pouting)

You never listen to me

Bertha moves away from the shore theatrically sulking
Mario smiles and shakes his head then takes off his hat and
kneels down by the water gently swirling it with his finger

MARIO
h Bertha I wish you wouldn’t say
hat It hurts
(sobbing a little)
t hurts me when you say those
hings

to

tH

BERTHA
(turning)
Well mebbe next time y’all should
show me some respect I’m an
upstanding woman you can’t just
interrupt me mid-sentence

MARIO
I know I justI’m just a fool
I’m a fool for you Bertha

BERTHA
(swiftly swimming back
over to him)
Don’t think I don’t know what you
think you’re doin’ You’re only
being nice to me so’s I join up and
fight that suh-lime ball Wario

MARIO
(affronted)
No
(after a pause)
Well yes but-

Bertha wails covers her eyes with her fins and turns away
but stays near the shore this time After letting her get
over the worst of her sobbing fit Mario wades into the water
and attempts to wrap his arms around Bertha’s body resulting
in a kind of awkward half-hug

MARIO
(pressing the side of his
face against Bertha’s
side thus covering it in
a sort of thin slime not
an outright “Eeeew” but
certainly worthy of a
minor cringe)

Oh Bertha you know you’re worth so

much more to me than just a

soldier

BERTHA
(sadly)
I aaaaaam
MARIO
(being honest)
Of course admire you Bertha I
aspire to be like you
BERTHA

(a little less sad)
You doooo

MARIO
Of course you have different
species hundreds of different
species all cooperating together
in your realm and who’s to thank

BERTHA
Me
MARIO
(points)

You Big Bertha You’re the glue
that holds the whole ocean
together

BERTHA
(fawning daintily putting
her fin up to the edge of
her lips)
Oh Mario it’s so nice of you to
say that

MARIO
(sincere)
It’s true

Mario runs his hand along Bertha’s side and she wriggles in
a slightly suggestive manner This scene has gone from
strange to bizarre to perverse in record time and Mario
knows it

MARIO
Just oooooonnnnne little bitsy
eentsy-weentsy tiny-winey favor

BERTHA
(as Mario rubs her head)
Mmmmmmmmmmmm
MARIO
(quiet somewhat
mischievious)

Is the Butter Bridge still the only

way onto the mainland

Bertha begins giggling as Mario pets her
they clearly have a

Though we’ve got no idea what it is
plan

and Mario joins in

INT KLINE CASTLE - OUTSIDE CRAIG’S ROYAL CHAMBERS

The massive doors are shut and we can hear shouting on the
other side Two Mushroom guards posted at the door are
trying to look nonchalant hurrying along any rubber-necking

palace staff A shadow falls over them

and they look up at

the massive body of Donkey Kong

CRANKY KONG
(standing unnoticed by the
guards between DK’s front
paws)
Ahem

Oh um-

I was wondering if you mightint let
me in to see the King

and gulps)
I mean it’s not like I’m saying
you can’t because you know you’re

Craig and Peach are standing nearly toe to toe shouting at
each other like little kids They’re so immersed in their
verbal battle that they don’t even notice the grand doors
opening behind them with Cranky Kong hobbling through

CRAIG
Well maybe if you spent more time
strategizing and less time getting
horizontal with Mario-

PEACH
(turning her back on him
and folding her arms)
Oh gag me with a spoon

Cranky Kong starts hobbling across the room to Craig and
Peach

more caravans of Koopa civilians
have arrived the Koopa encampment
on the south edge of the city has
grown greatly We’ve needed to
expand the wall just to-

PEACH
(concerned)
You expanded the wall

CRANKY KONG
We didn’t break it down we thinned
it on one side and then thickened
it on the other It would help us
greatly if you’d permit us to take
down just a portion-

CRAIG
(pointing a finger
getting intense)
No You are not to take down any
piece of that wall at any time

PEACH

(trying to soften Craig’s

words)
We understand that the city is
swelling Cranky but we can’t risk
taking down the wall even for a
second Wario is just waiting
for

Peach trails off points at her ear and looks at Craig
Craig nods grabs Cranky and wraps his arms around and over
him protectively

The entire southern wall explodes inward sending glass and
debris everywhere The shockwave knocks Craig and Cranky
down but Peach stands tall diving to the giant hole in the

A nice long panoramic shot reveals that the tanks and Mobile
Artillery on the horizon are firing raining dozens of shells
down onto the city The anciently designed Onion top towers
explode apart as modern United States incendiary bombs strike
them spraying fire and splintered wreckage down onto the
streets

155mm Howitzer shells crash through Chinese-style huts
reducing them to burning craters and 175mm shells from M107
mobile-guns turn houses markets curio shops and clothiers
into enormous plumes of red and yellow flame Some shells
are hitting the walls but are thankfully doing little to no
damage

frantically in every direction as more shells come down
disintegrating them in bursts of red hot fire The air
begins to fill with the Mushroom spores

A shell comes sailing in at them going hundreds of miles an

hour and Craig grabs it out of the air It’s going so fast

that the momentum carries him stumbling the way to the back
of the room and he turns to Donkey Kong just as Donkey comes
through the door

shell)
Here hold this

Craig storms across the room to Peach and Donkey goes to
check on Cranky who shakes some dust off him and waves him
away

CRAIG
(quietly)
What do we do Patricia

PEACH
(quietly)
I don’t knowI don’t

Another barrage comes down and one of them nails one of the
taller towels of the castle Its back breaks and it comes
toppling down past Peach and Craig crashing into the moat
below Peach starts to speak but then notices something on
the horizon

CRAIG
(shouting)
What do we do

PEACH
(smiles slightly)
Nothing
(points)
Look

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - OUTSIDE THE CITY OFF THE
SOUTHWESTERN SHORE - CONTINUOUS

We get a much better look at the attacking force it’s mainly
artillery guns being manned by hundreds of Shy-Guys who
climb around the gun-machinery like evil jungle gyms

But off the shore unseen by the Shy-Guys another force is
moving around two hundred bizarrely shaped old-Japanese
style sail-ships are smashing through the waves making a
beeline for the Mushroom city docks It’s the Kremling
fleet

EXT KAY ROOL’S FLAGSHIP - BOW - CONTINUOUS
King Kay Rool stands looking through a spy-glass

KING KAY ROOL
(mutters)
Scurvy dogs
(brings down the spyglass
and collapses it)
Mr Necky

An evil looking turquoise Kremling appears

NECKY
Yes Captain

KING KAY ROOL
Send word to all ships Open fire
on the Shy-Guys

NECKY
Yes sir

WE SEE SOME QUICK SHOTS OF POWDER BEING PUT INTO CANNONS
CANNON BALLS BEING LOADED ETCETRA ETCETRA

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - SOUTH-EASTERN HILLS - CONTINUOUS

The Shy-Guys continue firing hissing and grunting and
JONNY a shark-like creature wearing leather smiles and
barks orders to them Just as he’s about to order another
volley the dirt in front of him bursts apart knocking him
down

JONNY
(looking around baffled)
What the blast

The long-gun of one of the M107 mobile cannons suddenly bends
in half as though snapped by enormous hands as what looks
to be an antique cannon ball bounces off hitting a Shy-Guy
straight in the chest instantly reducing him to shards The
giant barrel of the M107 is now pointed directly into Jonny’s
face so he scrambles out of the way

One of the Shy-Guys accidentally triggers the M107’s gun and
it EXPLODES flipping over tanks on either side of it
There’s another silence and Jonny looks around

JONNY
(now seriously pissed off)
What the schmeck is going on here

All of the Shy-Guys seem to turn at once at a chorus of
echoing “booms” not the harsh clanking sound of artillery
but the eloquent somewhat monstrous cry of gunpowder
cannons Out on the ocean the Kremling fleet has opened
fire hundreds of plumes of soft grey smoke are rising up
into the air

A Shy-Guy contorts to stand erect

STANDING SHY-GUY
Oop

And then it starts to rain cannon-balls

The first volley of cannon balls literally eviscerates the
unprotected troops A cannonball strikes a Shy-Guy in the
top of the head and drives its head down through its torso
and to the ground and another catches one of the open
ammunition storages on a tank triggering a massive explosion
that takes out dozens of Shy-Guys and three nearby tanks

The main problem however is the lack of any serious
physical damage to the tanks themselves the cannon balls
for the most part bounce off of their armor harmlessly

JONNY
(taking cover behind a
tank)
Turn the cannons Turn the
cannons

The Shy-Guys begin spinning around the cannons of the tanks
to face the ocean

JONNY
Fire

We go to an extreme long-shot and see as all the tanks fire
and the ships let off a second volley The shells pass the
cannon balls in mid-air (with a few explosive collisions) and
tear into the wooden hulls of the ships A few ships are
destroyed outright exploding andor flipping over sending
Kremling bubbles (what they turn into when they die) spraying
everywhere

JONNY
That’1l1 show the bastards

EXT KAY ROOL’S FLAGSHIP - HELM - CONTINUOUS

Ships are sinking and burning all around Kay Rool’s ship but
he’s mostly unfased First Mate Necky runs up alongside him

KING KAY ROOL
What’s the report First Mate
Necky

NECKY
We’ve taken heavy losses They are
too strong

(MORE)

NECKY (contd)
Forget the Mushroom Kingdom Cap’n
they’ re cowards anyway You must
give the order to retreat

King Kay Rool draws a VERY archaic flint-lock pistol and
shoots First Mate Necky turning him into a cloud of bubbles

KING KAY ROOL
New First Mate Donal

A wiry red Kremling stands up a little shaken

DONAL
Yes sir

KING KAY ROOL
Tell all the ships that have
sustained crippling damage to make
haste to the docks of the Mushroom
City Tell all those who can still
fight to load scattershot

DONAL
Aye aye Captain
EXT KLINE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Craig and Peach still stand in the hole in the wall of the
castle

CRAIG
I don’t understand what’s going
on

PEACH

It’s the Kremlings They’1ll be
able to hold them but not for
long Wario was trying to catch us
off guard and soften us up

CRAIG
Right What now

PEACH
(her face very dark)
Bring me Bowser

EXT SARASALAND - NINJII ENCAMPMENT - EARLY MORNING
The desert is quiet and the wind howls The door of Luigi’s

adobe slowly opens and Toad groggy comes out and stops
dead staring at something we can’t see just beyond the door

The door creaks open again and Luigi comes out his hair all
messed up and leaning to left with a big random poof on the
right

Luigi yawns eyes closed and then Toad tugs on his arm and
we turn around to see what they’re looking at The entire
Ninjii town stands there in a thick black crowd staring at
him

LUIGI
(rubbing his eyes)
Oh uhHey

ALL OF THE NINJII
HeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyVVVVVVVVYVVYVYYY-

EXT SARASALAND - NINJII ENCAMPMENT - THE ROOF OF MOUSER’S
ADOBE

Mouser’s adobe has a big parasol set up on top of it
covering a little wicker table and two wrought iron chairs
Mouser and Luigi are eating tea and crumpets or at least the
Mushroom Kingdom equivalent Toad stands watch at the edge
of the room

MOUSER
And after we cross the Mountains of
Treachery and Betrayal we’1ll make
our way over the River of Bile
through the woods of Sheer Unending
Terror across the Empty Expanse of
Unbearable Stenches and Mysterious
Sores and into the Mushroom City
Simple enough what

TOAD
(looking down off the
roof)
Do they have to do that

We pan over to reveal that the entire Ninjii village is now
standing around Mouser’s Adobe staring blankly up at their
visitors

MOUSER
We’ re not much eh accustomed to
visitors

Toad nods still nervous
LUIGI
(trying to stay on topic)
Mouser you’re talking about an
awfully long trip out of the
desertCan’t we just take a pipe

MOUSER
(laughs sadly)
Oh no I’m afraid there’s simply
no chance of that

LUIGI

hy not

MOUSER
This is Sarasaland old boy the
only pipes out here are either
rusted or plugged up and on top of
that there isn’t one within seventy
kilometers of here and that’s at
the bottom of a Piranha Plant
filled ravine

LUIGI
ButHow long is the trip you’re
talking about I mean how many
hours

MOUSER
Hours

(laughs)

Luigi my boy it’s at least eight
days and that’s when traveling
light We’re bringing the whole

town with us I’d guess a two
weeks and that’s being generous

TOAD
(looks to Luigi speaks
quietly)

The plane boss the plane

LUIGI
Right Right we saw an airplane

Mouser looks on blank-faced

LUIGI

You know an airplane likeLike
a big mechanical bird that doesn’t
flap it’s wings

MOUSER
(quietly)
Ah That’s right the Ninjii scout
who brought you in said he found
you near the Field of Broken
Giants

LUIGI
Field of Broken Giants

MOUSER
It’s anOdd place I don’t much
fancy it myself the Ninjii
consider it to be cursed They say
it’s a place of great death and
misfortune

TOAD

(grumbling)
Everywhere in this desert is a
place of great death and
misfortune

LUIGI

(shushing Toad)
It’s very important that you take
us there

MOUSER
II hesitate to risk it
(laughs a nervous laugh
and twitches his rat-
nose)
It’s all bloody superstition of
course but I must say strange
things go on out there Why are
you so keen on getting your hands
on one of theseairflans

LUIGI
Airplanes

MOUSER
Ah yes airplanes

LUIGI
If we can get an airplane
especially one as big as the one
Toad and I saw I bet we can get
everyone in this whole town to The
Mushroom City in eight hours

MOUSER
(leaning forward)
Really
LUIGI

Well yeah if we were going to the
Mushroom City

Toad does a double take

MOUSER
Eh Where did you have in mind

LUIGI
I’m not going back there without
talking to Booster

Mouser sits back thinking

MOUSER
Good show old boy To the Field
of Broken Giants it is

Luigi smiles

UND THE OCEAN

ing Kay Rool floats motionless underwater his eyes staring
wide-open at nothing he’s surrounded by wreckage and is
being carried slowly out to sea (Northward) by the current

There’s a splash and Diddy Kong his wet little shirt
billowing around him swims down in front of Kay Rool takes
a long hard look at him and then gestures to something above
water

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - OFF THE SOUTHWESTERN SHORE -
CONTINUOUS

Destroyed and sinking Kremling ships are everywhere and
debris clink against the hulls of dozens of small rescue
ships manned by Kongs Mushrooms and Molemites A team of
Koopas is going from ship to ship on some sort of cargo-
skiff taking the salvageable cannons

On a smaller rescue boat Donkey Kong reaches down into the
water and pulls Kay Rool up and out into the open air
dragging him aboard Diddy climbs up and shakes himself
vigorously like a dog leaving him with a full body afro

DONKEY KONG
(snarling)
It’s Kay Rool

DIDDY KONG
Stay calm DK he’s hurt

Kay Rool suddenly coughs and then spits out some water

KING KAY ROOL
(weakly looking up at DK)
Donkey KongWhat happened

DONKEY KONG
Your ship done got blowed up Kay
Rool And you got blowed up with
it

KING KAY ROOL
(weakly standing up)
The fleetthe fleet is destroyed

Donkey Kong doesn’t react he just spits off the side of the
ship and glares at Kay Rool Diddy steps up

DIDDY KONG
No Not all of it look

Diddy points over to the docks of the city where at least
sixty ships float guns pointed up towards the hills where
the Shy-Guys are regrouping as yet more tanks and mobile guns
arrive with even more Shy-Guy infantry

KING KAY ROOL

(looking from the ships to

the Shy-Guy army to

Donkey Kong He stands

there thinking and then

forces words out of his

mouth pained)
In the days to come I imagine that
you and I the Kongs and the
Kremlings will be working together
very often I just wantArrrI
just want yea to know that I’m
sorry

King Kay Rool puts out his not-hook hand Donkey Kong just
looks at it

DONKEY KONG
You’re best to be staying away from
me from now on Rool You best
just STAY AWAY

King Kay Rool grunts and drops his hand

EXT SARASALAND - THE DESERT

Luigi Toad and several Ninjiis walk through the dunes
following Mouser who scampers through the sand like pro

LUIGI
(shouts up to Mouser
who’s pretty far ahead)
How much farther

MOUSER
Don’t worry chum just over this
next dune

TOAD
It’s funny Luigi I feel weird
walking in the desert without you

singing

LUIGI
Hey it’s okay you miss my golden
voi-

Luigi trips over a small chunk of metal sticking up out of
the sand and lands face first

LUIGI
(spinning and going into a
ridiculous kung-fu pose)
Ya

Toad laughs and there are muffled chuckles from the Ninjiis

LUIGI
(picking up his cap)
Oh that’s funny

TOAD
(coughing back laughter)
Oh no right Not funny

Luigi goes over to the piece of metal and tries to pick it
up he can’t He tries again harder and can’t Finally
he throws his entire weight into the pull and manages to
pull up most of the bow of a house boat

On the side of the hull ancient and corroded but still very

clear is an American flag

LUIGI
(very quietly)
No way Oh no freakin’ way

Mouser yells down to them from the top of the dune

MOUSER

Oi Sir Luigi Sir Toad Planning

on joining me are you

LUIGI
(staring at the boat)
This is not happening

TOAD
What’s wrong

LUIGI
(mumbling)
Nukes or pollution ora
meteorite or

TOAD
Luigi what’s going on
LUIGI
(mumbling)
Must be at least a billion years
and
MOUSER

Hurry up chums Sally forth

TOAD

Come on We can come back and look

at it later

Toad drags Luigi up the dune Luigi still staring at the boat
and muttering to himself They reach the top of the dune

and Luigi looks out onto

EXT SARASALAND - THE FIELD OF BROKEN GIANTS

It’s a massive flat plain of dry cracked dirt empty except

for a somewhat mind-blowing amount of ships
helicopters of human design

airplanes and

Everything from 747s and Leer Jets to Oil Tankers and Cruise

Liners

All of them have sustained considerable damage not only from
the ravages of time and the environment but also from
apparently having dropped three hundred or so meters from the
sky to the ground

Their point of origin is clear a huge black spot in the sky
Some of them are half-buried they’ve been there so long some
are almost intact but one thing is universal They are
dead Unmoving and empty Interrupting the reverent silence
and the moving morbidly incredible vista is a burst of
hysterical laughter from Luigi

TOAD
Huh

LUIGI

h thank god

(falls onto his back in

relief)
Thank you god Thank you Oh
crap I thought
(laughs and puts a hand
over his eyes)
Oh thank god

e)

MOUSER
(to Toad)
What’s come over him eh

TOAD
He’s gone totally schmecking
insane

LUIGI

(sitting up smiling by

way of explanation)
These ships and planes and stuff
they’re from my world I’m
guessing they fell through that
hole there

Luigi points at the hole

MOUSER
(bewildered)
That’s fascinating

TOAD
(waiting for Luigi to
continue)
So

LUIGI
(chuckles)
You see for a minute there I had
this horrible idea that this world
was actually my world the human
world millions of years after an
apocalyptic war

Toad makes a confused face

LUIGI

(peppy)

I watch too many movies
(exhilarated)

Let’s go
(jogging down the dune to
the flatlands)

Field of Broken Giants
(turns around letting out
a whoop of excitement and
raising his arms)

I am psyched

Mouser starts to speak but then stops

MOUSER
He’s a very strange person this
Super Luigi

EXT NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE

Traffic is at a stand still and Daisy’s orange Miata sits at
the center of it all motionless Cars honk and people
shout but the turnpike is deadlocked We see Daisy flailing
around inside her car though it’s not clear why

INT NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE - DAISY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Daisy is frantically pounding at the radio which is blasting
Cyndi Lauper’s “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” Finally she
snaps and begins repeatedly punching the display cracking
the glass then leans back and kicks it three times The
music cuts off

Daisy sits there painting and then turns to see a skeezy guy
with very few teeth and very bad skin sitting and nodding at
her in the next car over He winks and flicks his tongue
Daisy groans slams her head into the steering wheel several
times and something drops out of her coat onto her lap She
stares at it blankly not understanding even where it came
from at first

QUICK FLASHBACK TO

Mario’s sub-basement The Shy-Guy hisses and kicks Daisy in
the stomach with one of its thin legs its toe-talons cutting
her stomach and sending her crashing into a stack of
something which collapses down onto her We zoom in for a
moment to see that what fell were dozens of little metal
circles one of them landing in her front pocket

BACK TO DAISY’S
CAR

Daisy slowly raises the little golden object up in front of
her face It’s a primitive misshapen coin with the classic
Super Mario Mushroom emblem stamped into it

She blinks and then bites it the little tooth-print
indicates that it is indeed solid gold

Daisy mouths some words laughs in a sort of baffled
astonishment and then turns to look at the tongue flicking
guy who’s now taken off his shirt and is sensuously rubbing
his chest His lane starts to move and Daisy slams on the
gas

EXT NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE - CONTINUOUS

Daisy’s car screeches in front of the creepy guy’s car
bounces across the median and swerves onto the other side of
the turnpike A sign reads “CRAMPTON - 20 MILES”

SEGUE TO SHOT OF JONNY JONES LEADING THE SHY-GUYS AS SEEN
THROUGH A TELESCOPE

EXT THE KLINE CASTLE - CRAIG’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - BALCONY

Bowser Peach and Craig stand on the balcony Bowser looking
through Craig’s enormous telescope

BOWSER
(peering through the
telescope at Jonny)
Jonny Jones I should have known

CRAIG
Jones The Sharkem

BOWSER
(looking at Craig)
That’s right

PEACH
What Why would Jones ally with
Wallace What does this mean

BOWSER
(concerned pacing off of
the balcony with Craig
and Peach following)
It means first and foremost that
Wallace has been to Monstro Town

PEACH
Searching for generals

CRAIG
That’s right it’s not like he can
let the Shy-Guys run themselves

BOWSER

(annoyed at the

interruption)
And secondly it means that there’s
a chance Booster who we’ve
proclaimed to those people out
there is our last great hope is
very possibly dead

CRAIG
No way No way Wallace got
Booster he’s not that powerful
yet

BOWSER

Unless we’ve sorely underestimated
the amount of tanks under his
command more are arriving as we
speak

(nods to the horizon)
Is it true what I’ve heard about
Mario

CRAIG
(his face falling)
Word is the airship went down over
the Deserts of Despair They flew
right into some kind of ambush

BOWSER
(snarls)
Mario and his brother survived I
assume

CRAIG
We don’t know

Bowser actually looks concerned for a moment but quickly
hides that there’s question to whether it was concern at
all The doors open revealing Wooster

WOOSTER
A thousand pardons for the
interruption oh great leaders
but

Wooster notices that Bowser is staring right at him and
convulsively trembles

BOWSER
But

WOOSTER
(in a squeak)
We’ve taken a prisoner

The three rulers are silent

CRAIG
Aaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnd

WOOSTER
He keeps screaming “hello-copter”

Craig and Peach look at each other in a foreboding afraid
manner

EXT THE BUTTER BRIDGE

Anyone familiar with Super Mario World knows the vertically
perpendicular but widespread apart by height Butter and
Cheese Bridges

Hanging fifty or so feet above the raging current of Soda
Lake’s outlet into the ocean the Butter bridge is
constructed of sturdy logs tied together with dried vines

The bridge is over a mile long stretching from the very edge
of the Forests Of Illusion (which border the northern edge of
onga Land Wario’s previous venue of murder and mayhem now
almost entirely burned to the ground) to the Mushroom
Mainland

From the end of the bridge it’s a three hundred and fifty
mile trek to the territorial borders of the Mushroom Kingdom
and from there only ninety miles to Mushroom City

High above the Butter Bridge is the long ago destroyed Cheese
Bridge called such due to it’s gaping holes and breaks It
looks like it was built out of a steel erector set now

rusted and torn apart

Everything is as usual calm and serene and then the edge
of the Forest of Illusion topples and comes apart revealing
Wario’s army Wario standing tall on a tank up front

They reach the beginning of the bridge and he holds up a
hand all of the tanks immediately grind to a half and the
helicopters swoop low waiting Wario squints out at the
bridge Mario stands out near the center calm hands behind
his back

MARIO
(shouting to the army)
WARIO GOONS THUGS MINIONS
ETCETERA LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPONS
ABANDON THE TANKS AND LEAVE HERE
WITH YOUR LIVES

WARIO
Mario It figures

KAMEK
(appearing behind him)
Thould I give the order to fire
thir

WARIO
No We can’t risk hurting the
bridge and he knows it

Wario stomps several times infuriated denting the tank
WARIO
(shaking his fists just
like a little kid)
Stupid stupid stupid

Wario hops off the tank

WARIO
Fine We’1ll just roll over him
(shouts to the army)
FORWARD

The tanks begin to advance onto the bridge and its ancient
structure creaks and shivers under their weight Wario walks
out in front power-walking every step a stomp that
splinters the wood of the bridge Mario smiles and takes
something out from behind him

It’s a little blue balloon with something written on it in
its deflated state the inscription is illegible

As Wario gets closer and closer Mario blows up the balloon
to the size of a Volkswagen Bug in one breath and the font
becomes clear

It says in stark white letters “POW”

Wario stops dead and lifts his arms to the tanks which all
halt Mario grins and draws out a long needle Wario
blinks and turns to look back at his army they’re all on
the bridge now the helicopters flying low

Wario looks further the side of the bridge they entered on
is rapidly being chewed through by several dozen Cheep-Cheeps
who’ve climbed up the side of the canyon

WARIO
(more shock than anything
else)
Oh you son of a-

Mario jams the needle into the side of the POW balloon and
it pops with all of fury of a kilogram of C4 but none of the
fire A shockwave shakes Wario and his army and Mario
himself is flung back several dozen feet his already
tattered uniform being blown even further apart The wood of
the bridge around the detonation splinters and then flies
apart exploding a hole through the center of the bridge

There’s a moment of silence
WARIO
(breathing heavily)
OkayOkayNobody move

The hole in the center of the bridge cracks apart breaking
the bridge in half sending all of the tanks sliding forward

The great shift in weight distribution causes the Cheep-Cheep
chewed end of the bridge to snap setting off a bizarre
teeter-totter effect as the now entirely freed bridge segment
goes crashing down into the white-water currents

Wario is thrown up onto the turret of a tank smashing
himself face first into the metal Fifteen of the tanks go
sliding off into the water sinking like rocks and the
initial blast of water up and over the sides washes at least
a hundred Shy-Guys out into the crushing force of the waves

Up on the remaining half of the bridge Mario stands up
takes a running start and swan dives off the edge does a
triple somersault and drops towards the wreckage far below
which is rapidly and tumultuously being swept upstream

EXT SODA LAKE - THE RAPIDS - CONTINUOUS

Wario blinks several times wipes some blood off a cut on his
face and looks around the Shy-Guys still on the bridge
segment are trying to recover and Kamek is searching
frantically for his wizard’s hat He finds it reaches out
to grab it and then Mario comes smashing down on it with both
feet

MARIO
Kamek

KAMEK
M-m-m-ma-

Mario clotheslines Kamek into the side of an M107 and then
turns and ducks just before Wario can punch him into
oblivion instead Wario’s haymaker sends the tank sliding
off the bridge into the water taking out two more Shy-Guys

WARIO
(holding his fist hopping
up and down)

Ow Ow Ow

Mario punches him in the throat knees him in the stomach and
tries to toss him overboard but Wario rolls out of his grip
Sambo-Suplexes Mario to the deck then straddles him and
starts to try to beat in his face Mario easily dodges every
punch and throws him off and Wario lands on his feet atop a
tank

WARIO
(screaming at the Shy-
Guys)
Shoot him Shoot him

The Shy-Guys start to raise their guns and then the air
fills with Cheep-Cheeps leaping up and over the bridge
fragment yanking the Shy-Guys up into the air and overboard

Big Bertha throws herself up onto the other side of the
bridge like a breaching Orca bites into a tank and yanks it
overboard screaming Shy-Guys unloading AK-47s into her all
the way to little effect

A Shy-Guy being carried by a Cheep-Cheep goes flying by
Mario he laughs like a madman and goes on the attack
repeatedly kicking Wario in the head Wario throws some
crazy punches that Mario ducks and dodges then grabs Wario
in a headlock and drags him down to his knees

Wario reverses the headlock into a suplex and slams Mario
onto the hood of a tank Staying in the suplex position
Wario picks Mario back up and again slams him down onto the
bridge

Mario breaks free stumbles away trying to get his head
together then suddenly turns and hits Wario with a shuffle-
side kick in the jaw that knocks him flat on his back Mario
grins

MARIO
(points down river)
Look Wallace

Wario still dazed looks up river to see that they’re
rapidly heading towards the ENORMOUS waterfall we saw from
Soda Lake

WARIO
(drawing two pistols)
How terrifyingly cliche

Wario opens fire but Mario ducks and dodges out of the way
Wario finally manages to shoot Mario in the leg knocking him
down He starts to get to his feet and Wario shoots him in
the shoulder knocking him back down Mario looks shocked
this isn’t going exactly how he expected it to

MARIO
(touching his shoulder-
wound)
Aghschmeckin’ gorflab

The bridge segment crashes into some rocks and breaks apart
the more damaged half sinks and is torn apart by Cheep-
Cheeps Before Wario can shoot Mario Bertha breaches out of
the water and onto the bridge causing the whole segment to
rock wildly in the ever worsening white-water up-and-down

Mario and Wario are thrown to opposite edges of the wreckage
and Bertha makes a bee-line for Wario

WARIO
(takes out his walkie-
talkie)
Helicopters Where are my goddamn
helicopters

The walkie-talkie buzzes and lets out a Shy-Guy moan

Several of the helicopters swing low over the wreckage which
is now only around one hundred feet from the edge One
swoops down and uses its machine guns to cut a swath through
the bridge wreckage in between Wario and Bertha driving her
back into the water

WARIO
That’s more like it

Wario goes to leap up to the helicopter but Mario pops up
and grabs his ankle swinging him down into the wreckage
Wario eats bridge big time

WARIO
(spitting out some blood)
Damn it
MARIO

(laughing spitting out
some blood as well)
You don’t get away that easy

Wario turns and takes a shot at Mario but Mario ducks and
kicks the gun out of Wario’s hand with his good leg

WARIO
(yelping)
Agh You broke my finger

Mario kicks Wario in the face and his head bounces off the
side of the wreckage into another kick

WARIO
(scrambling away)
Schmeckin’ dorn

Mario pulls a fire flower out of his pocket and pops it in
his mouth chewing quickly Little plumes of fire shoot out
of his bullet wounds and he begins to limp towards Wario
his uninjured arm raised the air around his hand swirling
with heat distortions

WARIO
(a little panicked)
Get away from me

Wario draws a double barreled sawed-off shotgun out of a
holster on his thigh and shoots from the hip Mario ducks
and lets loose with a barrage of fire-balls that Wario
manages to run through singed a few times but unhurt Wario
turns and fires again with the shotgun this time hitting
Mario square in the chest

WARIO
(insane glee)
Ha Got ya

Mario goes flying into the rapids Wario watches him
disappear under the water and then jumps up onto one of his
helicopters

One of the Shy-Guys inside makes a low moaning noise as they
watch the wreckage go over the side of the giant waterfall
some Shy-Guys still struggling to hang on

WARIO

It’s all right don’t worry He
thinks he slowed me down he thinks
he hurt me he’s wrong We’1l take
this Kingdom apart with what we
have

(raises his walkie-talkie)
This is Wario to all helicopters
Tell all remaining tank groups not
already at the primary target to
head for Tadpole Pond

(the Shy-Guy pilot moans)
Take me to Mushroom City

CUT TO BLACK

EXT SARASALAND - THE FIELD OF BROKEN GIANTS

Mouser followed by Luigi and Toad and flanked by the
Ninjiis walks through the vast emptiness of the Field of
Broken Giants They walk alongside the bow of a gigantic
ocean liner nearly destroyed by its fall from the giant
whole Luigi runs his fingers along the side quiet
thinking

TOAD
What are these things

LUIGI
They’re from my world Boats
airships
(looks over at the
deflated wreckage of a
blimp)
Stuff like that

TOAD
I don’t understandWhere are all
the people

MOUSER
(looking back at them)
They all arrive here empty as I
understand it

LUIGI
Creepy
(looks up into the vast
empty hole in the sky)
That means that somewhere between
your world and mine they just
(gestures)
Poof Lost between realities

Toad shivers nervously Mouser sniffs the air

MOUSER
Just up here
(Mouser points at what
looks to be a hollowed
out yacht)
In that

There’s the faint clanking of machinery from the ruined
yacht and thick black smoke coagulates over the roof froma
make-shift chimney the whole thing looks rather sinister
Luigi and Toad start to walk towards it but then stop when
they realize that Mouser and the Ninjiis aren’t following
them

LUIGI
We’re doing this alone

MOUSER
The Ninjiis regard this as an
accursed place it was hard enough
to get them to come this far and
you’re certainly not going to get
them to go anywhere near there

LUIGI
And you

MOUSER
They say this is the heart of the
darkness in Sarasaland poppycock
of course but I’m not going out
of uh

LUIGI
Respect for their beliefs

MOUSER
Ah yes old boy that’s the ticket
I respect their beliefs

LUIGI
Right We’ll be right back

MOUSER
Oh I’m sure you will chum I’m
sure you will

Luigi and Toad head towards the yacht

EXT SARASALAND - THE YACHT - CONTINUOUS

The yacht has been cracked apart by its fall from the sky
but someone has taken the time to patch it haphazardly patch
it back together Tropical umbrellas from the cruise liners
line the top and the smokestack that seemed so intimidating
from far away is really rather whimsical covered in spray
paint to look like a palm tree

As you get closer you can see that the whole hull of the
ship has been spraypainted quite beautifully it’s a mural of
jungles and blue waters standing out stark and glaring
amongst the endless yellow of the cracked earth Inside
whirring and clanking can be heard along with faint music

Toad and Luigi approach

LUIGI
Well This isn’t weird

Toad laughs

LUIGI
You want to go in first

TOAD
Oh no I think I’1l1 let you have
that honor

Luigi groans and limps up to a giant make-shift door in the
side of the hull He knocks twice and the door drifts open
After a pause to think he pushes the door all the way open

INT THE YACHT - CONTINUOUS

The entire insides of the yacht have been emptied it’s now
one giant room a fully operational garage the centerpiece
of which is an enormous patchwork motorcycle easily as big
as a VW Bus

Next to it is a normal sized motorcycle being used for
reference by FUNKY KONG who’s looking for the correct
valve to install so as to match the smaller model Luigi
enters accidentally knocking over a stack of SCIENTIFIC
AMERICAN magazines When Funky talks its in the easy free
manner of a Beatnik of the American 1950s

FUNKY KONG
(preoccupied not looking
up from his work)

Hey watch the stash cat

LUIGI
(confused)
Oh uh sorry

FUNKY KONG
(still not looking up)
Gimme two tocks and a tick and then
I’1l let you slide your jive

Funky Kong concentrating intensely fits a valve into the
side of the motorcycle He reaches around the top of the
chasis and turns a key causing the motorcycle to rev to
life

FUNKY KONG
(laughing a raucous laugh
and turning to Luigi
smiling)
You hear that racket cat
(pleased)
That’s the mezz right there
LUIGI
(after a pause shouting
over the motorcycle’s
engine)
Etro Kong

Funky Kong abruptly turns off the motorcycle
turns to Luigi

FUNKY KONG
Where did you hear that name jack

LUIGI
(steps forward hand
outstretched)
I’m Luigi Luigi Cassavettes I’m
a friend of your brother’s

Funky stares at him

LUIGI
(lowering his hand)
We need your help Etro

FUNKY KONG
(narrows his eyes then
shakes his head)
I don’t swing by that handle no
more cat

LUIGI
Huh

FUNKY KONG
(spits the name out)
Etro That ain’t my name no more
I’m Funky baby Funky Kong
(goes around to the other
side of his motorcycle)
Etro Kong is dead

Luigi stands there unsure of what to say

FUNKY KONG
Where you from cousin

LUIGI
New Jersey

FUNKY KONG
(quietly)
New Jersey Like New Jersey in the
United States

and slowly
LUIGI
(more than a little
shocked)
YuhYeah
(stands there in silence)
How did you know about-

FUNKY KONG
(laughs going back to
work on his motorcycle)
I been to your world cousin I
been all over South America
Africa Europe

LUIGI
(a little in shock)
What How

FUNKY KONG
That there hole in the sky it’s
like the mother of all pipes dig
You go through that it takes you
straight out over the Atlantic
bout nine hundred miles off the
coast of Florida

LUIGI
(going closer to the
massive ape as it tinkers
with the engine of its
chopper)
You’vebeen to Earth

FUNKY KONG
(stares at Luigi like he’s
retarded)

I’m going to go out on a limb here
and say you ain’t been listenin’

LUIGI
ButHow How’d you get up to the
hole

Funky laughs and sets down his tools

FUNKY KONG
Now that that’s a question worth
asking cat

EXT THE FIELD OF BROKEN GIANTS - LANDING STRIP

It’s a gravelly home-made landing strip just under a mile
long constructed primarily from pieces of the planes and
boats that have fallen through the hole

Sitting at the start of the strip near the Yacht (which had
concealed the strip when they first approached it) is THE
FUNKY FLYER Formerly a C5-Hercules military cargo plane
calling the Flyer “big” doesn’t even begin to cover it

Sitting next to it the scale making them look tiny are a
biplane and a fixed-wing single propeller crop duster type-
craft this one fashioned entirely from spare parts The

biplane looks to be mostly intact

The Funky Flyer C5 is a grab bag heavily modified
accessorized and generally pimped out with pieces of other
planes (and even some boats) Funky Kong and Luigi walk from
the Yacht towards the planes Funky Kong narrating as they
go Toad walks a good distance behind them looking more
than a little skeptical about the whole situation

FUNKY KONG
(referring to the crop-
duster)

The little guy I call “The Hide
Beater” He was the first thing I
ever built

(his tone drops a little)

Back in Kongaland

(referring to the biplane)
That’s the Fraughty Issue I found
her nearly intact out here a couple
years after I first landed These
days I use it to go up into the
portal It’s small so it don’t
show up much on radar

LUIGI

I’m still not getting the logistics
of the whole dimensional travel
thing How do you go unnoticed I
mean I hate to break it to you
but you wouldn’t exactly fit in in
a crowd on Earth

(after a pause quietly

as an afterthought)
Unless you were in New York

FUNKY KONG
I don’t leave the plane cat I
bring some pocket change from round
here drop it outside the plane at
an out of the way airfield and pow
my gas is paid for I go back to
where I got the hole marked on the
GPS and zap cat I’m back here
like a dicty dime note

LUIGI
A what

FUNKY KONG
Dicty dime note cat you got a
hearing disorder

LUIGI
No no I’m good

He looks back at Toad who shrugs They reach the planes and
Funky turns to Luigi bursting with pride

LUIGI
(pointing at the Funky
Flyer)
What’s this thing

FUNKY KONG
(proud)
Aw this This beatific buddy ghee
is the Funky Flyer It’s got a C5
chasis turbines off 747s jets
from eight Tomcats

As Funky prattles on Toad approaches Luigi

TOAD
Who is this guy
LUIGI
Etro Kong
TOAD
Donkey’s brother The shame of the
Kongs
LUIGI
Yeah
TOAD

How’d he end up here

Luigi makes a strange froggy-face

TOAD
I’m sorry I have no idea how to
interpret that face

LUIGI

It means “I have no freaking clue”
TOAD

Oh I was on the right track then
LUIGI

Excellent
TOAD

Yeah I’m getting good at human
facial expressions

LUIGI
Oh okay what’s this

Luigi makes a hideous pig face pulling his nose up and his
lower-lids down

TOAD

That’s what you usually look like
LUIGI

Go screw yourself
TOAD

(affronted)

Well I-

FUNKY KONG

(turning back to them)
You even listenin’ Cazzavorts

LUIGI
(snapping back to
attention)

Cassavettes

FUNKY KONG

Man I’m beefin’ you to the specs
of the plane and you’re chatting
with your little Mushroom friend
there and-

LUIGI
No I’m listening I’m listening
Sayyou thinkYou think your
plane could carry about eighty six
Ninjiis

Funky looks skeptical

ESTABLISHING SHOTS THE MUSHROOM CITY

The city is quite far along in its progression from trade
capitol to military fortress Cannons now line the walls
the parapet walkways patrolled by armed Koopas Kremlings and
Mushrooms (with the occasional Molemite and Kong)

Outside of the walls the Molemites are working diligently
and have set up an armored passageway into the city along
with an elaborate series of trap-pits filled with iron
spikes Bombard towers have been erected every one hundred
feet on the streets of the city which are pretty desolate
save the occasional Yoshi-pulled cart

Nervous Mushroom citizens look out through closed windows and
storm shudders at the three enormous air-galleons tethered by
chains to a makeshift sky-dock near the main Kline Castle
listing and tilting gently in the breeze The number of
tanks on the horizon has tripled now with more heavy
artillery weapons than ever not to mention a virtual fleet
of heavily armed APCs Shy-Guys crawl and slither over all
the vehicles like a swarm of hideous bloodthirsty ants
Jonny Jones stands in the shade of a tank’s gun watching the
city with cold appraising eyes

INT THE KLINE CASTLE - LOWER LEVELS - PRISON CELL

Craig sits across from Croco who’s nervously pacing the
cell ranting

CROCO
(panicked)
Mario says “say helicopters they
won’t give you any trouble” no
trouble my tail been locked in
here five hours and not as much as
a loaf of bread to eat or a kind
word a ‘thank you Croco” just-

CRAIG
(tired)
Croco for the last time I told
you we’d let you at as soon as you
gave us more specific information-

CROCO
(screaming)
And I told you I ain’t got no more
spific informassion than that

Craig stands up and Croco quickly calms himself

CROCO
Look I didn’t exactly count the
tanks or the helicopters I don’t
know how many times I can tell you
the exxxzact same thing before I go
loopy Wario’s nearby and he’s
got enough shy-Guys on the way to
burn this sity to the ground Take
it or leave it

CRAIG
And he didn’t mention Luigi

CROCO
I don’t even know who Luigi is

CRAIG
And he didn’t say what he was going
to do or if he was coming back

CROCO
He said it was none of my business
And he’s right it isn’t Now let
me out of this ssell so I can get
out of this damn sity before Wario
shows up

Craig looks discouraged Wooster appears banging on the
bars

CRAIG
Wooster
WOOSTER
(emphatic)

It’s the Nimbans sir They’re
here

CRAIG
(stands up)
What’s wrong Why’re you flippin’
out

WOOSTER

All of them

Craig’s face goes blank

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - WARIO’S ARMY - CONTINUOUS

hadow falls over the tank armada Jonny Jones’ jaw goes
lack and his cigar drops to the grass We pan up to see

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

hen looks up

atonoryd

MONTY MOLE
(very quietly)
Oh

The largest of the StratoCities is easily half the size of
the Mushroom City genuinely mindboggling to look at The
two smaller cities are no less impressive one of them
accompanies the capital whilst the other lags a little ways
behind crossing the expanse between the Mushroom City and
the hillocks where Wario’s troops have camped out

EXT KLINE CASTLE - HIGH-TIER COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Peach Bowser Cranky and Kay Rool stand out on the
courtyard watching as the Nimban Capital city starts to
descend

Craig runs out followed closely by Wooster then stops dead
Craig looks at the landing floatilla speechless and turns
to his sister who looks equally amazed

CRAIG
CripesThe last time I saw one of
the Strato-Cities in person I was
ten years old

BOWSER
(snarling)
The capital is descending they’re
going to land it right on the wall
at the eastern side

CRANKY KONG
(quickly)
We can rebuild the wall around it
yes

KING KAY ROOL
With effort that could’ve been
better spent

CRAIG
I’1l be the judge of-

Everything shakes as the Nimban capital city touches down at
the east edge crushing a giant portion of the wall The
clouds around its base dissipate revealing an enormous
complex web of steam-based machinery

PEACH
(wide-eyed)
This is just surreal

CRANKY KONG
(putting a fatherly hand
on her shoulder)
It is beautiful The Kingdoms
truly united

(slowly)

What’s up

BOWSER
(his eyes going narrowing)
Something’s wrong

QUICK CUT TO
JONNY JONES

A long gun behind him finishes its adjustments and Jones
raises a fin Several ASTROS 2s load up their rockets and
everything seems frozen in place

JONNY
(screaming)
FIRE

LONGSHOT - FROM THE MUSHROOM CITY TO WARIO’S ENCAMPMENT

The guns of Wario’s army erupt flares of fire filling the
air with smoke Hundreds of artillery shells zip through the
air and strike the bottom and side of the lagging
StratoCity eviscerating the hover-machinery which explodes
apart and rains down onto the empty field

PEACH
(screaming)
Oh my god

With the hovering machinery at the southern half of the
StratoCity destroyed the entire structure tips forward
listing badly towards the city Several of the buildings
struck by artillery shells collapse onto each other debris
and shrapnel flying dozens of Nimbans falling everywhere

As the Nimbans die they turn into poofs of vapor that begin
to form a gentle fog over the majority of the damaged city as
it begins to rapidly lose height dropping towards the
northern wall of the Mushroom City

Another barrage of shells nails the now completely exposed
underbelly of the StratoCity and it drops completely out of
the sky shaking the earth on impact like a meteor-strike
Dirt grass and short-field trees go flying everywhere as the
crashing StratoCity carves a path through the field
buildings shattered debris and Nimbans being thrown in every
direction

Down on the walls Donkey Kong hurriedly shoos the remaining
guards off the bridge but then is thrown off as the city
crashes through the heavily armored walls and begins to
wreak complete destruction as it slides into the Mushroom
City
INT CLUB SUGAR

Club Sugar is the sort of place that never changes you would

swear the same people were dancing the same evil
wafting through the air

Chet Rippo sits alone at his table in the corner

into his drink A golden Mushroom coin clatters down in

in between Etro and his

arm gripping him

tightly suddenly very

noble and statuesque

almost like Mario)
I assure you I am not “playing”
And unlike you I have some loyalty

Funky Kong looks like he’s just been slapped in the face
Toad’s eyes are open so wide they practically cover his
entire head

The Ninjii beats him and Mouser quickly whips his tail and
messes up the board

MOUSER
Oi the blasted wind

The Ninjii makes a disgruntled chirping sound

MOUSER
What It was the wind Tain’t

Toad appears at the side of the yacht and shouts something
One of the Ninjiis chirps

NINJII (SUBTITLE)

MOUSER
(pondering)
He says to bring the whole town

EXT SODA LAKE - THE RAPIDS

We start off on a close up of the crushing torrents at the
bottom of the falls We focus there for a moment then
slowly pan up the falls farther farther farther until
finally we reach the top

We pan across the rapids to a rock that juts up just over the
current

a bit of it is missing smashed out of place and we go in
closer to reveal that a hand in a torn white glove is holding
onto the rock squeezing it so hard that it’s crushing the
water-rotted granite like cheap plaster

Mario who’s clearly been holding onto the rock for several
hours now finally musters up his strength and yanks himself
up onto jagged surface He gags several times and then
throws up a little He gently touches his shoulder wound
gasps in pain and rolls over onto his back revealing the
shotgun hole in his chest

He grunts and laughs despairingly then reaches into his
pockets He pulls them out empty He reaches into his big
chest pocket and again comes up empty

MARIO
(weak)
Oh come on

He looks up and sees that a single Magic Mushroom grows out
of a patch sitting atop the rock

MARIO
(coughs)
HeheheMust be mylucky day

Mario reaches up but can’t quite get his hand on the
mushroom He goes up on three limbs his hand outstretched
to grab the mushroom

MARIO
(stretching)
Come onSchmeckin’-

Mario lunges forward and grabs the mushroom but loses his
balance on the slippery rock and falls off dangling by one
arm

MARIO
(rolling his eyes more
annoyed than scared)
Aw motherfu-

The Mushroom tears free and he drops into the current We
watch as his tiny red and blue form is swept over the
waterfall and falls down down down down down into the
mists below

EXT CRAMPTON NEW JERSEY - CRAMPTON HERITAGE MUSEUM

The Crampton Heritage Museum isn’t very big it was possibly
once a school house or maybe even a barn

It doesn’t look like a museum more like a mausoleum The
building has shifted slightly on its foundation and now
leans gently to the left cracked all over from the first few

moments of the fall

Daisy’s Miata is the only car in the parking lot with the
notable exception of a VW Bus which has in the past been
in some sort of catastrophic collision it’s bent nearly in
half Chet and Daisy get out looking up at the building

EXT CRAMPTON HERITAGE MUSEUM - FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Daisy goes up to the front doors and reaches out to open
them but then stops her hand lingering just in front of the

pull-handles

CHET
(leaning over her
shoulder)
What’s up

DAISY
(gesturing to the door)
Look for yourself

The door is covered in cobwebs it hasn’t been opened in a

looong time

CHET
Cobwebs

DAISY
Chet you’re sure this place is
open

CHET

Yeah I mean the lights were on

in the windows right

Daisy after a moment’s thought nods and opens the door

INT CRAMPTON HERITAGE MUSEUM - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

It’s a dingy deadwood room funhouse-tilted to the left A

counter with a yellow tinted glass-divider

(perhaps not

originally yellow tinted) is the east face of the room and a
wall covered in Civil War-era photographs is the west The
wall parallel to the entrance is completely blank save a
single extremely narrow door barely wide enough to

accommodate a person of average size

Daisy looks around decides it’s all clear and goes further
in Chet in tow She heads over to a small window in the
yellow glass and goes to ring a bell on the counter when an
ancient hand very suddenly snakes out and stops her

CHET
(leaping back)
Aah

GRIMMLEY a personage so ancient he now more resembles a
veiny white bat more than a man sits just beyond the
counter playing a NINTENDO VIRTUAL BOY system

GRIMMLEY
(not moving his eyes out
of the Virtual Boy’s
visor)
Somethin’ I can help you with

CHET
(still shaken)
Aw man you scared the bejesus
outta me

DAISY
(unfazed)
We want to see the museum
(looks around)
This is still the museum isn’t it

Grimmley looks up from the Virtual Boy revealing deeply
sunken (but VERY bright) green eyes He seems vaguely
surprised but his face is too palsied to convey much
emotion

GRIMMLEY
(ignoring Daisy’s
question)
Who’s this Chetland a new
girlfriend

DAISY
(quickly)
No Ima friend from out of town
Two for the museum please

Grimmley looks at Daisy and smiles an act that contorts his
face into such a horrifyingly bizarre configuration that the
bat analogy seems if only for a moment to be quite literal

GRIMMLEY
Ah
He turns and pulls a si
register that in turn

lver crank on an art-deco cash
spews out two bright yellow tickets

which show out in extreme contrast to the gray and black

world

A series of low rumbles echoes throughout the building and
off-key vaguely folksy music begins to play over
loudspeakers throughout the building cuing in a twisted
scratchy vocal track

but occasionally briefly
goes back to the demonic
whispering rattle)
Did you know that Crampton was
voted one of the most interesting
places in New England in the East
New Jersey Tribune 1967

Daisy looks at Chet Chet looks at Daisy The narrator
prattles on in the background

And now step through the door and
be taken on a visual journey
through the fascinating history of
Crampton

The door slowly swings open revealing only darkness beyond
with the strange folksy music playing faintly in the
distance

GRIMMLEY
(shooing them)
Hurry up and go now or you’1l miss
all the cues

Daisy and Chet go to the door and look into the darkness
beyond terrified Daisy shakes herself out of it and steps
into the darkness Chet stands there chewing his nails and
then Daisy’s arm shoots out grabs him by the collar and
pulls him in The door slams shut

INT CRAMPTON HERITAGE MUSEUM - A SERIOUSLY SCARY PLACE -
CONTINUOUS

At first there is only darkness the hum of machinery and
the weird off-puttingly creepy folksy music Then a line of
ceiling lights come on illuminating an automated walkway
which disappears off into the darkness giving the effect
that the walkway exists in a null void in space and time

Chet and Daisy stand at the start of the walkway dead still
terrified and are nearly thrown to the ground when the
walkway jerkily starts up

CHET
Whoa

DAISY
Jesus

MUSEUM NARRATOR
(piping up as they move
forward)

(MORE)

MUSEUM NARRATOR (contd)
Did you know that Crampton was an
unofficial part of the original
thirteen colonies

An ancient graffiti covered map lights up on a wall that
seems too far away to actually be in the museum It displays
the thirteen colonies and in front of it stands an auto-
animatronic man in 1600s regalia this is SIR GEORGE
CARTERET He’s missing an eye and his clothes are torn in
several places revealing his inner workings underneath The
walkway stops in front of him and Daisy and Chet nearly fall
down again

A spotlight hits Sir George and he straightens up an
ancient fatherly British voice playing on a recording in the
background as the animatronic moves its lips and hands
simulating life Terrifying crap-in-your-pants life

SIR GEORGE CARTERET
Oh hello I am Sir George
Carteret and as of 1664 I own the
land you call “New Jersey” It was
given to me by King Charles the
second after he took it from the
Dutch

(puts a hand to its brow)
But alas I have a problem

The walkway starts up again moving around Carteret to reveal
little hovel with a fake fire Carteret turns as well
rotating without moving at all

SIR GEORGE CARTERET

You see when the Dutch left they
abandoned several dozen of their
people Why you ask Because
they were effected with

(snaps into the terrifying

voice as a moth flies out

of his eye-cavity)
Leprosy

The fake campfire brightens up revealing a half-dozen
hunched animatronics in burlap sacks They all look up at
once revealing badly rotten foam-rubber “leper” faces that
look scarier now than they were ever intended to it’s almost
reminiscent of the Shy-Guy “all look at once” deal

Chet and Daisy react appropriately

SIR GEORGE CARTERET
Because of the highly infectious
nature of leprosy I was faced with
a difficult decision

(MORE)

SIR GEORGE CARTERET (contd)
place the lepers in the newly
founded St Hoskins Hospice or
exile them to live in the woods
Luckily for me fate was about to
intervene

The lights shut off and the moving walkway jerks to life
throwing Daisy and Chet into each other It rounds a corner
and comes upon a lit up “lakeside” scene fallen apart over
time tears in the canvas of the background allows scene-
lighting to shine through and the tree which is the a
centerpiece of the scene has been covered in grafitti and is
now badly cracked revealing the cheap paper-mache interior

A lone figure dressed in archaic Preacher’s clothes sits by
the “water” This is ZEBEDIAH KALE Kale cuts loose with a
mechanical (but friendly) laugh and stands up

ZEBEDIAH KALE

(jerkily his joints more

than a little rusted)
I am Reverend Zebediah Kale who
arrived here in the New Jersey
Colony with my brother in the
Summer of 1665 When heard about
the plight of the lepers was
deeply touched I too came from a
family with a long history of
disease and deformity It was in
the spirit of compassion that I
took a big risk and agreed to take
charge of the lepers and lead them
out to find a new home outside of
the colonies

(looks down and his nose

simply drops off)
Sadly in my travels with my
congregation I was infected and my
brother abandoned me to move down
to the Carolinas But the lepers
were loyal and I was delivered to
them a prosperous bounty

(gestures at the world

around him)
I led them here to a place I named
“Crampton” after my British
birthplace the Crumb Township

DAISY
(looking to Chet)
This place was a leper colony

CHET
Hey I don’t kno-

The lake-side scene goes dark and the walkway starts up in
its usual abrupt manner throwing Daisy and Chet into each
other once again

CHET
Crap man they can’t keep freakin’
doing that

DAISY
Shh we’re going to miss the next
one

CHET

Man I just wanna get outta here

DAISY
(pointing at a lighting up
area on their left)
Shh shh This is interesting

CHET
(muttering to himself)
Crazy broad

The lights reveal a 1120 miniature model of the town circa

1665

little more than a series of tents surrounded by trees

situated around one main unpaved road at the end of which
sits one fully formed Colonial Mansion Daisy stares at it
and Chet notices as the narrator prattles on about how
quickly the town was built

CHET
What’s up boss

DAISY
(pointing at the miniature
mansion)
I’ve been there

MUSEUM NARRATOR
(getting a word in over
the discussion)
Kale’s mansion sat on a hill next
to Gull Pond overlooking the town
with watchful eyes

DAISY
Mario’s shrink
(snaps a couple times
trying to remember)
Gadd Edward Gadd

CHET
Whaddya think it means
DAISY
(thinking)

I don’t know yet

MUSEUM NARRATOR

But as the months passed by Kale
spent less and less time with his
congregation and more and more time
in the woods the non-infected
members of Crampton’s populace
began to question Kale’s methods

A “town hall” scene lights up behind Chet and Daisy and they
turn to look at it It’s filled with non-automated
mannequins which have suffered badly with time several of
them are missing limbs and one is even missing its head

An even more disintegrated Kale figure than the last stands
up on the stage looking more like a zombie than a human
being slightly hunched over (though that might be
intentional)

MUSEUM NARRATOR
When the townsfolk confronted him
about his odd behavior this is
what Kale had to say

ZEBEDIAH KALE
People of Crampton DO not presume
to question my sanity or my forth-
rightness as I have made a great
discovery a gate from this world
to the next

Recorded babble comes from the townsfolk manikins who of
course sit eerily stock still

ZEBEDIAH KALE
In the woods beyond Gull Lake
there is a pit from which one may
enter a happier brighter world
where the curse of leprosy is
annulled and gravity itself cannot
hold the human spirit down

More babble from the crowd The walkway starts up again and
this time Chet and Daisy manage to brace themselves The
lights come up on a scene of Kale his legs laying on the
floor separate from his body (clearly not intentional)
sitting at a desk writing in his diary

MUSEUM NARRATOR
As Kale fell deeper and deeper into
madness he began to spend
literally all of his time either in
the woods or his basement writing
incoherently in his diary This
entry from August 3rd 1666
demonstrates just how far Kale had
gone

ZEBEDIAH KALE (VO)
(scribbling mechanically
in the diary)

My trips to the other world have

cost me a terrible price

apparently while it grants me
trength and agility far beyond my
reams it is also changing me
aking me slowly less and
essHuman My joints ache at

ll times and my face has begun to

end and shift I have lost five

tone since my first trip and no
atter how much I eat I cannot
egain the weight I feel my
houghts slipping away becoming
impler becominganimal

hether this is an effect of the

ther world’s strange blessings or

of my own diseased body I cannot
be sure

OBZHNAtKBOTMrPBAN

The lights go down on him

MUSEUM NARRATOR
On the evening of August 5 Kale
gathered all those still loyal to
him and led them into the woods
wearing their leper’s cloaks and
special porcelain masks Kale had
fashioned in his workshop It isa
day forever remembered in Crampton
Tne March of the Lepers

The museum shuts down everything grinding to a halt The
lights shut down leaving the Dynamic Duo in absolute
darkness

CHET
What happened

GRIMMLEY (ON INTERCOM)
Blast it one moment one moment

The folksy music suddenly blares to life and the lights come
up all around the walkway and revealing tons of fake trees

and in the most honest to god freak-out moment in the story
Shy-Guys

Daisy does a swift double flash back to the mask in Mario’s
basement and the rampaging Shy-Guy puts one and one together
and whips out her gun Chet yelps and ducks and Daisy
stands stock still her gun levelled at the nearest Shy-Guy
The narration kicks back in

MUSEUM NARRATOR

The lepers of Crampton where never
seen again it’s thought they were
the victims of a cult-like mass
suicide or perhaps some form of
radiation from the woods It
remains a great American mystery to
this day

Daisy slowly lowers her gun and Chet stands up nervous

MUSEUM NARRATOR
Now put those grim thoughts out of
your head as we adventure on to
the next stage in the town’s
history the great paint-making
boom of 1696

Daisy looks to Chet and Chet looks back Daisy smiles
slyly she’s back in the game

EXT THE YACHT - LANDING STRIP

Luigi sits up on one of the Funky Flier’s gargantuan wings
his legs dangling in the breeze He’s watching as Mouser and
Funky Kong lead a group of over one hundred and fifty Ninjiis
up the Flier’s massive loading ramp

One of the Ninjiis is goofing off to the amusement of the
others doing cartwheels and backflips up and down the sides
of the ramp eventually tripping and falling face first into
sand Luigi laughs quietly and then goes back to looking
out over the horizon at all the destroyed relics from the
human world

Toad shouts something Luigi can’t here and he mumbles a
response

TOAD
(louder climbing all the
way out)

(MORE)
TOAD (contd)
I said the Ninjiis are almost all
on the plane

LUIGI
(looking up)
Huh Oh right good

TOAD
What’re you doing out here

LUIGI
Nothing I was justYou know
looking at it

TOAD
What

LUIGI
-The world

TOAD

(laughs)
Right right I keep forgetting
how weird this must be for you

LUIGI
It’s not that it’s thatDaisy
would’ve loved this place

TOAD
(thinking)
Daisy yourFiance

LUIGI
Well yeahformer fiance

TOAD

Right
(looks out at all the
destroyed boats planes
etc)

Why

LUIGI

It’s perfect for her I mean first

off she loves the desert

TOAD
Loves the desert

LUIGI
She says it gives her peace She
likes the sand likes looking at
the sky

(MORE)

LUIGI (contd)
Plus she’s a history nut She’s
always buying these massive books
on the formative years of Europe
and finishing them in a day And
this place is like a dumping ground
of history some of these wrecks
are over two hundred years old
some of them maybe more See
look you see that
(points at an ancient sail-
ship marked “Expervier”)
That’s the Expervier It
disappeared in 1815 while carrying
a peace proposal to end the War of
1812 I noticed it when we came

in
TOAD
UhHow’dya know all that
LUIGI
Daisy
(smiles)

This place would be like a freaking
play ground for her

TOAD
(after looking at Luigi
for a moment)
Let’s get inside Luigi Crazy
Kong says he’s almost ready to take

off

LUIGI
Funky

TOAD
Huh

LUIGI

Call him “Funky”

TOAD
That explains the smell

LUIGI
(slapping Toad lightly
upside the head)

Wise ass

Luigi and Toad go in through the window whilst down below
the last of the Ninjiis get on board followed by Mouser

INT THE FUNKY FLIER - COCKPIT

The massive cockpit of the C5 has undergone
some”modifications” since Funky Kong took ownership Most
notable is the absence of a roof removed to accommodate
beings of Funky Kong’s stature

Both the pilot and copilot chairs have been removed and
replaced by one gigantic barcolounger with a big wagon wheel
control interface in front of it Christmas lights cover
every bare surface and the instruments have clearly been
modified so as to make them morefunky

Funky Kong himself is sitting in the barcolounger flipping
switches listening in a sort of hysterical ecstacy as the
plane powers up Luigi peeks through the cabin doors

FUNKY KONG
Come on in bro

LUIGI

(coming in)
SoIs it going to fly I mean
youve flown it before right

7

UNKY KONG
Oh sure yeah once or twice not
counting the time I crashed it

UIGI
crashed it

E

7

UNKY KONG
Hey be cool cousin I’m still
here right

LUIGI
Yeah but-

FUNKY KONG
Come on get excited be vibrant
be just a little beatific for me

Funky Kong turns a clearly improvised starter mechanism and
the five bus-sized engines roar to life Luigi let’s out a
little shriek before he catches himself

FUNKY KONG
(shouting over the
engines pulling down his
flight-goggles)

(MORE)
He gives Luigi the thumbs up

FUNKY KONG (contd)
You best get back there in the
cabin bro Gonna get mighty windy
out here

LUIGI
(shouting over the
engines)
Right right

FUNKY KONG
(pulling flight goggles
down over his face)
Don’t be nervous buddy Next
stop Monstro-Town

EXT THE YACHT - LANDING STRIP - CONTINUOUS

The Funky Flier pulls out onto the runway

speed

INT THE FUNKY FLIER - CARGO BAY

The massive cargo bay is filled nearly to capacity with

Ninjiis

who’ve pressed themselves up in the window in awe

of the technology of flight chirping nervously

MOUSER
(trying to be reassuring)
It’s quite alright chaps quite-
(the plane goes over a
bump and mouser yelps)
Bloody hell

Luigi and Toad stand in the cabin just next to the pilots
doors strapped in Toad is actually in a storage
compartment as the human straps won’t accommodate him he
looks pretty durn cute for a highly trained mega bad-ass

TOAD
(nervous)
So uh you’ve ridden in one of
these before right Back on your
world

LUIGI
Sure
(after a pause)
Well not driven by a gorilla and
not one of these specifically-

which Luigi nervously returns

and starts gaining

TOAD
(going into the fetal
position panicked)
Oh god We’re all going to die

EXT THE YACHT - LANDING STRIP - CONTINUOUS

The Funky Flier steadily gains speed and after a few pieces
fall off the behemoth rises up into the vivid blue sky of
Sarasaland

FUNKY KONG
(though we can barely hear
him)
YAAAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOO000000N

INT THE CHIPPED CUP DINER - MIDDAY

Daisy and Chet sit at a booth sipping coffee Daisy sets
down her cup and looks at Chet who looks bewildered

CHET
I still don’t get it you’re saying
that that thing in Mario’s basement
was one of the lepers

DAISY
(more animated than she’s
been the entire story
she’s really interested
now)
Yes Well no not exactly that
thing is what the lepers became
after four hundred years of
inbreeding and some sort of
catastrophic mutation triggered by
exposure tosomething

CHET
Something that Mario found again
last year

DAISY
Right

CHET
Okay but I don’t get it the
Reverend turned into one of those
things in a coupla months how come
Mario ain’t-

DAISY
(stops mid-sip to
interrupt)
The leprosy that’s my guess

CHET
Huh

DAISY
This thing I don’t think it
changes you mentally I think it
changes you physically based
around the parameters your body has
when it comes in Maybe the
leprosy caused some sort of adverse
biochemical reaction

CHET
Uh
DAISY
It turned them into monsters
CHET
(understanding)

Right So because Mario didn’t
have leprosy-

DAISY
No monster exactly

CHET
So What now

DAISY
We wait for a warrant

CHET
A warrant For what

DAISY
A search warrant with the fine-
print very loosely phrased we’re
going Edward Gadd’s house and
we’re going to search the living
hell out of it

CHET
Why’ re we waitin’ for a warrant
Why don’t we just bust in like we
did with Mario’s house
They sit there looking at each other
days they’ve been through a lot And with a sort

tremulous

become friends

DAISY

First of all we didn’t “bust in”

(she pauses)
Okay we did

(Chet laughs)
But this is different this Gadd
guy is smart reallllllly smart
and devoted He knows everything
I guarantee it But he’1ll use
every legal loophole in the book to
protect himself and Mario so-

CHET
So we play it safe

DAISY
Sort of I’m tired of being led
around by the dick the smug
bastard might have his heart in the
right place but either he talks or
I’m going to rip his friggin’ face
off

CHET
Whoa there-

DAISY
I’m done chasing dead ends I
intend to see Luigi before
nightfall

CHET
(after a pause)
You know a lotta guys would kill
for a girl like you

DAISY
I’m not interested in a lot of

guys

CHET
Well if Luigi turns out to be a
dead end you could give my ex-wife
a call She doesn’t like guys
either

over the past three

uncomfortable pause they realize that they’ve

They both start giggling like idiots

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - FALLEN STRATOCITY

Peach in a Sailor Moon (TM) T-shirt sits on the roof of the
castle quietly watching the frantic activity in the city
below Hundreds of Mushroom Empire workers are working hard
rebuilding the walls around the StratoCities

Craig is right in there with them lifting giant blocks of
granite single handed Cranky Kong sticks his head out of a
nearby latice window sees her and smiles

CRANKY KONG
The Nimban King isn’t happy about
losing one of their cities the
first day in the Empire

PEACH
Five hundred lives were lost in
that crash
(under her breath)
The Nimbans can flomp my lofango

CRANKY KONG
(chokes back a laugh
covering it with shock)
Princess

The Peach looks down and sighs embroiled in a little girl
huff Cranky climbs out onto the spire and plops down
beside her

CRANKY KONG
You know why Bowser always
kidnapped you right

Peach looks up at him still huffy but at least interested

CRANKY KONG
It isn’t because he loves you
Patricia It’s because he knows
that without you Craig can’t doa
damn thing

(Peach laughs)

Oh sure Craig is a great
diplomat no doubt He’s a rarity
an honest politician Buta
warrior A strategist A thinker
No That’s you Craig may be the
heart of this place but you’re the
brain

(MORE)

CRANKY KONG (contd)
I’ve known it since the moment I
met you back when you children let
me in after Kay Rool exiled me

Peach looks at Cranky who smiles

PEACH
What about Mario

CRANKY KONG

Mario is the arms and the legs
He’s the pair of hands that get us
place up and running

(looks to the hills)
Wario attacks tonight I’m certain
of it

(a little stern)
So will you stop this foolishness
and start thinking

PEACH
Dodo you think he’s alright

CRANKY KONG
Who

PEACH
Mario II’m wo-

CRANKY KONG
Don’t you dare waste a thought
worrying about Mario and his
brother They’1ll be fine and be
here right when we most need them
I’1ll bet my best banana on it

PEACH
(smirks)
High stakes

CRANKY KONG
I like to live dangerously Now
would you be kind enough to help me
back through the window

EXT FIZZ RIVER BANK

It’s an amazon style river branching out from the bottom of
Soda Falls In the muddy sand at the bank lies a lone
figure it’s our hero Mario In his outstretched hand is a
mostly eaten mushroom Silence

He rolls over coughs a few times and then groans and pulls
down his bloodstained overalls and looks through the shotgun
hole in his shirt the wound is gone replaced by what
appears to be a rapidly shrinking bruise

MARIO
I still got three lives left
schmecko
(standing up stumbling)
I still got three lives left

EXT TADPOLE POND - ENTRANCE CANYON

It’s a rustic Mediterranean canyon covered in vines and
moss A little wooden sign that sits at its entrance reads
“Tad Pole Pond” We focus in on it and then its crushed
under the treads of an M109 tank

EXT TADPOLE POND - LILO TOWN - CONTINUOUS

Lilo Town looks like an ancient Mayan village built on an
enclosed (but pleasant) swamp with parts of it literally
built into the canyon walls Froggix go about their
business playing on lily-pads picking fruit from the
bushes talking amongst themselves

In the distance there’s the powerful creaking and whirring
of machinery swiftly approaching The Froggix slowly stop
whatever they’re doing and start looking towards the canyon
road

INT FROGFUCIUS’S TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

Frogfucius sits meditating on the altar with a group of
students meditating on the floor in front of him including
Mallow the Nimban Prince we saw earlier There’s an earth-
shaking explosion and students snap out of their meditation
standing up and running to the windows

FROGGIX MONK
It’s Wario’s army They’ re-

Dozens of bullets smash through the window and into the
students Froggix when they die melt into a sort of frothy
green jelly Mallow dives to the ground barely avoiding
another barrage of gunfire

Frogfucius calmly climbs down off the altar and hobbles
across the room putting on his glasses He looks out the
window dozens of fires reflected in his spectacles

There are two more enormous explosions and part of the
Temple is simply sheared away effectively turning the room
into a courtyard The howls and moans of Shy-Guys get closer
and closer as Frogfucius turns to Mallow

FROGFUCIUS
Prince MallowI am a fool

Mallow yelps as BELOME comes crashing through the wall
(accompanied by what seems like hundreds of Shy-Guys) and his
long club-like tongue whips out grabs Frogfucius and pulls
him into his cavernous fang-filled mouth

CUT TO BLACK

EXT DREAMLAND

Luigi floats peacefully on a rainbow slide carrying him
through a vista of hearts palm-trees and candy canes Very
suddenly the rainbow slide dumps him into

EXT TADPOLE POND - LILO TOWN

TADPOLE POND is engulfed in flames which ride on oil over
the water with burning Froggix running from place to place
and being reduced to green jelly by bullets from Shy-Guys
Luigi is dumped onto a lily-pad surrounded by ten foot
flames and slowly stands up to see Kirby floating in front
of him

IRBY
There’s no time Luigi You have
to go Tadpole Pond

LUIGI
What But I was going to get
Booster-

IRBY
(helpless panicked
childlike)
Luigi there’s no time If you
don’t go now all is lost The
Kingdom will be doomed

LUIGI
But what about Booster We need
him-

IRBY

Tadpole Pond needs you

LUIGI
Can you help us Can you take
us there

KIRBY
I can only help in moments of fated
life or death I can only assist
one person when they most need me

LUIGI
I-

The world begins to fade

KIRBY
Please Luigi hurry They are all
dying

INT THE FUNKY FLIER - CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Luigi snaps awake and tries to stand up resulting in him
slamming against his seat-belt restraints and banging the
back of his head on the wall

TOAD
(still laying in the
baggage compartment)
Smooth

Luigi rips his belt off and goes to slam on the cockpit door
but then notices that all of the Ninjiis down in the cargo
bay are pressed up against the windows

LUIGI
(to Toad)
What’s going on

TOAD
(climbing out of the
baggage compartment)
We’ re over Monstro Town

LUIGI
(quietly jumping down to
a window)
What

Luigi leaps down to one of the windows and presses up
against it

EXT MONSTRO TOWN - SKY

The Funky Flier soars through the smoke-clogged sky over
Monstro Town a sort of gigantic rubber-band ball made of
insane and very dangerous looking roller coasters Off-key
music and a wide variety of unpleasant sounds radiate up to
the plane

INT THE FUNKY FLIER - CARGO BAY

Luigi pulls away from the window and makes a superhuman leap
up to the cockpit door

TOAD
(standing up hand on his
sword-butt)
What’s wrong What’s going on
LUIGI
(pounds on the cockpit

door)
Kirby just contacted me we need to
turn around

TOAD
Kirby Dreamfolk Kirby He
schmecking talked to you

LUIGI
(pounding on the door)
The Froggix are-

An intercom panel on Luigi’s right buzzes to life

FUNKY KONG (ON INTERCOM)
Hey be cool cousin you open that
door and you’1ll depressurize the

cabin

LUIGI
(slapping his forehead)
Duh right I’m stupid

TOAD

(freaking out)
Kirby schmecking talks to you
I’m flomping my dorn right here in
the goddamn airflan

FUNKY KONG (ON INTERCOM)
You got somethin’ to beef me use
this thing

Luigi awkwardly picks up the mic and talks into it

LUIGI
We need to turn around

FUNKY KONG (ON INTERCO
What We’re here partner I’m
just looking for a place to land-

LUIGI
No Don’t land we have to get to
Tadpole Pond as soon as possible

FUNKY KONG (ON INTERCOM)
Tadpole Pond That’s the opposite
direction bro back towards
Mushroom City I-

LUIGI
Just do it Funky

A pause

FUNKY KONG (ON INTERCOM)
Luigi if we’re gonna make it
before sundown we’re gonna need to
kick up the speed a few notches

LUIGI
I don’t understand
FUNKY KONG
Be cool cat And strap yourself

in

Luigi looks at Toad and they both panickedly rush back to
their seats

EXT MONSTRO TOWN - SKY - CONTINUOUS

The Funky Flier jerks left then banks a hard right dozens
of smaller fighter-jet engines springing out of dozens of
hatches and portholes In the cockpit Funky slaps a lever
marked “OH SNAP” The jets scream to life and The Funky
Flier takes off like a rocket

EXT THE DONUT PLAINS - WOODS

Mario in a truly wretched looking state (but now totally
uninjured) works his way through the woods eventually
bursting out into a small town on the edge of the DONUT
PLAINS

At first Mario looks happy but then he realizes that the
town isn’t a town anymore it’s just silent smoldering
wreckage interspersed with tread tracks

Mario for the first time in the narrative doesn’t look
optimistic Instead he looks vaguely confused like a dog
helplessly watching its owner die of a heart attack on the
bathroom floor He walks into the town looking from the
burnt houses to the bullet riddled piles of Mushroom-person
clothing strewn all over the dirt streets

He passes a barn with a single live Yoshi huddled amongst the
dissolved bodies of many dead ones and by now it’s clear
Mario is in emotional shock on auto-pilot He notices
something off screen and abruptly drops to his knees
staring at it

MARIO
Oh

We pan around to reveal what has finally brought Mario down
a huge dead burnt tree outside of the town is covered
covered in Mushroom spores caught on the branches There
must be thousands of them as they literally blanket the
entire tree beautiful to a person who doesn’t know what they
signify horrifying to one who does

At the bottom of the tree are dozens of clothes and a few
uniforms including those of Mushroom Soldiers with their
sledge-hammer side-arms unused There are also a few Shy-
Guys cloaks and abandoned guns but these were clearly
accidental deaths by friendly fire

Mario stares up at the tree and drops to his knees in a pile
of spent bullet shells A Shy-Guy with its mask slightly

raised climbs down the side of the tree chewing a Mushroom
spore

Mario instinctively reaches down grabs a pistol off the
ground and aims it at the Shy-Guy tears in his eyes The
Shy-Guy notices and yowls at him dropping the Mushroom
spore

Mario stands there still as a statue with the gun aimed at
the Shy-Guy’s head

After a pause he lowers the gun and then drops it entirely
The Shy-Guy hisses and scurries off into the shadows of the
destroyed town

Mario looks at the huge burnt tree and grips the trunk with
both hands With one powerful tug he rips the entire tree
free of the ground and lifts it up above his head slowly
waving it back and forth shaking loose the thousands of
spores which float gently up into the late afternoon sky

As he does this the Shy-Guy he let go slowly creeps up
behind him now holding an AK-47 It lifts the AK pointing
it at the back of Mario’s neck inches away

The last spore shakes free of the tree and in one fluid
motion Mario crescent-kicks the gun in the Shy-Guy’s hands
(causing it to discharge several rounds into the ground) and
swings around the tree like a baseball bat The impact sends
the Shy-Guy flying up into the sky its gun going off at
random

Mario reaches down and picks up the short-handled sledge-
hammer of a dead Mushroom soldier slipping it into a loop on
his belt then whistles causing the single live Yoshi in the
town to come galloping up

Mario leaps on and rides it off down the road at full speed
his face locked in a terrifyingtough growl-scowl a man on a
mission They pass a sign reading “MUSHROOM CAPITOL CITY -
125 MUSHMILES” and disappear down the road

Back at the base of the tree there’s a distant yowling and
then the Shy-Guy comes crashing down and shatters into
hundreds of pieces

INT KLINE CASTLE - THE GRAND CONFERENCE ROOM

Craig sits at the head of the table with Peach at his side
The rulers of the Kingdoms sit around it as they did in
their first meeting but the mood is much more intense

THE CLOUD KING
I again demand that we be allowed
to get our cities in the air If
those tank things get to us on the
ground-

CRAIG
And we again deny you King Strato

PEACH
With all respect the tanks can get
to you in the air you saw what
they did to Pileus City

THE CLOUD QUEEN
(huffy)
A lucky shot

BOWSER
(grinning morbidly)
Several hundred lucky shots I’d
wager

CRANKY KONG
Not to mention that with these
hellocotter contraptions that rat
Croco said Wallace has he could
conceivably fly up and land on
your cities in mid air

BOWSER
He’d have to catch them they’d be
fleeing from the city by then

Kay Rool laughs

THE CLOUD KING
Silence Koopa
(looks around the table
filled with righteous
indignation)
Am I the only one who noticed that
his airships went unscathed in
their entrance to the city

CRAIG
There were hardly any tanks out
there when he arrived

THE CLOUD KING
Maybe he planned it that way

BOWSER
(standing up still calm
but clearly seething just
beneath the surface)
I’m puzzled wise king are you
accusing me of cowardice or
conspiracy
(MORE)

BOWSER (contd)
Because I assure you if your tone
gets any harsher will not
hesitate to drag you out of this
room by your fat head and eat you
in the city square-

THE CLOUD KING
He threatens me He threatens me
here in this chamber of peace

CRANKY KONG
If you could both please just calm
down-

BOWSER
(snarling)
Cowardice or conspiracy wise King

PEACH
(using a voice which
simply cannot be denied)
Bowser Sit down

Bowser turns at her and starts to snarl but the Princess
let’s loose with a snarl of her own and he promptly sits
down in his spiked throne arms crossed There’s an
uncomfortable silence

KING KAY ROOL
(speaking up)
I for one understand why the fair
Princess desires yee to keep yer
cities docked

THE CLOUD QUEEN
(turning up her nose at
Kay Rool)
And why’s that lizard

KING KAY ROOL

(matter-of-factly

ignoring the insult)
Because ye got them parked at the
aft of the battle In case the
blaggards break through all of our
defenses and hornswaggle the city
there be only two venues of escape
my ships and yer city and surely
yer city’1l hold many more people
than my few wrecks

(turns to Craig and Peach)
Aye

CRAIG
(smiling)
Exactly right Kay Rool

THE CLOUD KING
(still outraged although
at this point he’s not
sure why)
Youre using our cities as esc-

PEACH
As fallback points If Wallace
does manage to beat us we’re going
need to have a plan B

MONTY MOLE
I love crackers I mean not any
kind of crackers in particular but
I like the crunchy ones more than
the soft ones If I had to choose
a type of crackers crunchy or
soft I’d choose crunchy But I
wouldn’t like being stuck with
having to eat crunchy forever for
instance if I was-

THWAP Cranky knocks Monty upside the head with his cane

CRANKY KONG
Stop that

CRAIG
Now if you’1ll all turn your
attention to the telescope on the
terrace I can show you why I
called this meeting

EXT THE KLINE CASTLE - TERRACE

The consortium of leaders stands around Craig’s giant
telescope apprehensively The Cloud Queen has an eye to the
scope her face blank She straightens up her face still
completely blank

THE CLOUD KING
What is it my darling What’s
wrong

THE CLOUD QUEEN

We zoom across the plains to show Wario sitting on a tank
out in front of all the others smiling smoking a cigarette
He looks up squints raises some binoculars to his eyes and
then waves Back on the terrace

THE CLOUD QUEEN
(whispering)
He’s here

EXT TADPOLE POND - ENTRANCE CANYON

The Funky Flier has landed in a giant field of tall grass a
couple hundred yards outside of the canyon Luigi Funky
Kong and Toad walk down through the tracks of the tank
treads

TOAD
If these tank things have two
treads to a whole over twenty of
them came in this way

LUIGI
You can tell that just by looking
at the tracks

TOAD
I grew up out in the Darklands my
father was a tracker

FUNKY KONG
(points)
Peep that

Further down in the canyon four Shy-Guys are gathered around
something on the ground poking and pulling at it

FUNKY KONG
Whatwhat is that What’ve they
got

A little flash goes off between the Shy-Guys and they back
off for a moment revealing a beaten and bruised Mallow
weakly waving a handful of lightning at the Shy-Guys One of
them comes up behind him and roughly kicks him in the head
and the lightning goes out The other Shy-Guys swarm him
kicking and punching

TOAD
(turning to Luigi)
Luigi we-

Luigi’s gone

TOAD
(quietly)
Luigi

A gunshot rings through the canyon and one of the Shy-Guys
explodes apart inside his robes Luigi cowboy revolver
raised and smoking stalks towards the Shy-Guys taking aim
One of the Shy-Guys scrambles to pick up his gun getting a
bullet to the chest for his trouble his shattered pieces go
flying everywhere

The two remaining Shy-Guys leap at Luigi one of them he
catches with a punch that shatters its head but the other
leaps up onto his torso and begins beating his skull like a
drum

Luigi stumbles back and the Shy-Guy pulls a combat knife
but before he can use it Toad breezes by and decapitates him
The Shy-Guy’s head flies up and shatters mid-air leaving
only a mask and piece of cloth to fall to the ground Mallow
coughs weakly

TOAD
(leaning down next to
Mallow)
Prince Mallow I-

MALLOW
(standing up waving a
ball of lightning
blinking raindrops and
mist out of his eyes
weak)
Getget away from me

LUIGI
(as the lightning nearly
catches him in the nose)
Whoa

MALLOW
(blinking)
II know you I saw you at the
meeting
(eyes go VERY wide)
Youre Super Mario’s brother

Mallow collapses hugging Luigi’s legs

MALLOW
(looking around anxiously)
The Mushroom troops
(turns seeing Toad)
(MORE)

MALLOW (contd)
Sir Toad Where are the troops
Where is the army

There’s uncomfortable silence
LUIGI
There aren’t any troops Prince
Just us and a few others

Prince Mallow looks as though someone just destroyed all hope
for the universe

MALLOW
»oh

LUIGI
MallowWhat the hell happened
here

EXT TADPOLE POND - LILO TOWN

Everything that was once standing is either on fire or
collapsed The whole town is covered in Froggix slime the
equivalent of splattered blood and gore In some places the
slime is so thick it’s ankle deep

Mallow looks around and then drops to his knees prone
motionless Luigi steps forward and puts a tentative
uncomfortable hand on Mallow’s shoulderhead (it’s hard to
differentiate)

MALLOW
I couldn’t stop them sir
(looks down crying
raindrops)
They justthey just killed them
all They killed everybody

Mallow breaks down sobbing

LUIGI
God

TOAD
They couldn’t have killed every
one there were thousands of
Froggix here they justThey
can’t have murdered every single

one
FUNKY KONG
(surveying the massacre
somber)

(MORE)

FUNKY KONG (contd)
See for yourself little buddy
This isThis is catastrophic with
a capital K daddy-o

There’s a silence as they watch the once beautiful swamplands
burn

LUIGI
(starting towards the
town)
No No I refuse to accept that
(looks to Toad)
Toad get Mouser and the Ninjii
We’re going to find survivors

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - SOUTH-EASTERN HILLS

Wario sits on his tank muttering to himself staring at his
lit cigarette

WARIO

(muttering)
Bastardsthink they can bamboozle
me got another thing
comingThink they can scare me
intimidate me they ain’t seen the
half of it

(louder harsher)
They ain’t seen the half of it
goddamnit I’l1-

JONNY
(appearing around the side
of one of the tanks
nearby a little unnerved
by Wario’s ranting)
Something wrong boss

WARIO
(pointing at the embattled
Mushroom City)
Look

JONNY
II don’t see anything pardner

WARIO
Look closer See those lines on
the ground there

JONNY
(looking harder)
Yeah
Wario mutters a couple times
quizzically

WARIO
They’re trenches They must’ve had
the Moles dig’em last night That
way when our tanks roll over
(makes a crash gesture)
They all fall down

JONNY
So how do we get over them

WARIO
It’s simple really We blow the
hell out of them then drive over
the rubble Even up the field you
know
(laughs a little
hysterically)
You know what they think Jonny

JONNY
(clearly a little scared
of him even though he’s
twice Wario’s size)
UhWhat boss

WARIO
They think that they’ re
(raises an indignant
finger)

Smarter than me Well I’11 tell
you what Jonny
(thinks)
They might be But I’11 tell you
one thing man they aren’t crazier
than me They care about this
place those freakin’ dummies
They have a vision or whatever and
I’1l tell you I had a vision too
man did And then they they
stab me in the back when I try to
carry it out that little rat Toad
and the rest of’em the fungus
they tricked me I’11 tell you
though it’s their turn now right

(takes a long draw on his

cigarette)
Got my guns I got my guns man
Ain’t nothing a bow and arrow can
do to a gun I’11 tell you that
right now

and Jonny looks at him

JONNY
Um

WARIO
It’s the goddamn bitch Patty
Patricia Thinks she knows
everything thinks she’s queen of
the world I’11 tell you what
once I get her head on a stick and
her dead eyes are watching her city
burn then we’1ll see who knows
what right Jonny

Jonny kind of half opens his mouth unsure of what to say

JONNY
Uhyeah

WARIO

(after an uncomfortably
long pause)

I shouldn’t smoke you know

JONNY
(blanking out completely)
What

WARIO

Cigarettes

(waves the cigarette in

front of Jonny)
These things They’re bad for you
but you know it’s calming I
started the first time I got back
to my world Besides

(takes an enormous drag on

the cigarette which

burns it down to his

fingers)
There’s something emotionally
comforting about breathing smoke
right

Wario exhales blowing an insane amount of smoke out of his
mouth He smiles and throws down what’s left of the
cigarette grinding it into the plush green grass

WARIO
(smiling)
In one hour Sunset
(MORE)

WARIO (contd)
I want the first barrage to
concentrate only on the walls and
the trenches just beat the hell
out of their defenses Next one
comes seconds later into the
residential sector

JONNY
The what

WARIO
The houses right there to the
east of the castle

JONNY
Right gotcha We can hit that
with the missiles

WARIO

You’ re reading my mind I want the
whole place on fire Jones I want

the city burning before we set foot
in it

JONNY
Napran

WARIO
Napalm Lots of it I want the
sky to turn black

A battalion of tanks the ones that ravaged Tadpole Pond
arrives They pull up alongside Wario’s looooong row of
Honest Jon mobile missile launching trucks Wario grins

WARIO
Well
(grins in a manic
distinctly berzerk but
somehow child-like
manner)
The gang’s all here

Wario hops down off the tank to greet the new regiment which
is being led by KATSINI
EXT TADPOLE POND - SWAMP THICKET

Luigi makes his way through some hanging vines causing him
to fall down into a thigh-deep muck-swamp

LUIGI
(quietly)
Ah schmeck

Luigi does a double take covering his mouth with a hand
“Did I just say ‘schmeck’” He gets over his shock and
starts into disgust feeling around in the murk There’s a
noise from beyond the slime-pit and Luigi stops dead
listening

It’s a small voice not human but still recognizable as a
child It cries out and then a second gruffer booming
voice speaks over it Luigi wades towards the voices and
climbs up out of the slime and comes through a curtain of
vines into a large clearing an extension of Lilo Town which
though mostly destroyed is not burning

At its center stands Belome next to a roaring bonfire above
which he’s fixed a large bamboo cage containing at least a
dozen Froggix children

There are several more of them down on the ground next to
Belome crying and screaming as he chuckles and grins his
fang-filled grin An older FROGGIX MAN stands in front of
Belome holding what looks to be a sharpened bamboo chute

BELOME
(continuing an already
started train of thought)
-you going to do with dat anyway
Poke me to death

FROGGIX MAN
You stop it Leave the children
alone they’ve done you no harm

Belome picks one of the children on the ground up with his
prehensile club-like tongue and sets the child down in the
cage above the fire

BELOME
Or what mon ami I hate to break
it but you ain’t cutting a very
imposin’ figure

FROGGIX MAN
I’llI’1l

Belome picks up another of the children and the Froggix Man
lunges forward and pokes him very hard in the tongue Belome
drops the child and smiles widely

BELOME
See now dat’s bein’ a man
o’ action

Belome brings a giant foot down on top of him crushing him
into slime Luigi’s eyes widen and something in his brain
snaps His transformation from Real Estate dealer to
interdimensional super-hero warrior is nearly complete

LUIGI
(shouting)
HEY FOUR EYES

BELOME
(bellowing)
Hey who dat What you doin’ down
here
LUIGI

(appearing from the

shadows holding his

Peacemaker)
My name is Luigi Cassavettes and
I’m an unstoppable war machine
I’m here to save Tadpole Pond

BELOME
(laughs evilly)
You a liddle late for dat hooman

LUIGI
(gritting his teeth)
Step away from the children

Belome blinks

BELOME
Wario sed I could eat deh ones his
guys didden get
(turns back to the baby
Froggix)
You bes’ waitchur turn eh

LUIGI
I’m taking those children and
leaving
(raises his Peacemaker and
clicks back the hammer)
Get out of my way or be destroyed

BE LOME
(reevaluating the
situation)

Zat a gun

LUIGI
Yes Now step away I’m giving
you three seconds

BELOME
Ey now we ain’t gotta fight right
buddy Weez can be friends

LUIGI

BELOME
(taking a step towards
Luigi)
Lez not be pointin’ bullets at each
other-
LUIGI

Take another step forward and I
shoot Two

BELOME
Ey ey calm down dere no need to-

LUIGI
Three

Belome suddenly whips out his tongue like a giant frog the
spiked muscle fires twenty feet across the swamp and knocks
the gun out of Luigi’s hand but it goes off the errant shot
skimming the tongue which Belome swiftly retracts yowling

BELOME
(pained)
Mah tun Mah tun

Luigi strides across the pond to Belome and calmly goes to
punch him Belome brings up a furry paw blocking

BELOME
Ha

Luigi kicks Belome like a giant soccer ball sending him
rolling him across the swamp covering him in thick slime and
mud Luigi pulls down the cage and rips it open

LUIGI
(all business)
Let’s go kids

FROGGIX KID 1 FROGGIX KID 2
Wow Wow

Belome struggles up to his feet shaking off the mud

BELOME
(furious)
You dunh get away dat easy baby
frogs Yous’ still gonna be mah
lunch

Belome charges across the pond at Luigi who stands at the
ready Just before he reaches Luigi a bolt of lightning
very suddenly (and loudly) arcs down out of the sky and
strikes Belome right between the eyes lighting him up like a
Christmas tree

Luigi turns and sees a royally pissed-off Mallow float down
from a nearby embankment

MALLOW
(furrowing his cute little
brow)
He had it comin’

Belome struggles up to his feet smoke wafting up off of him
dazed

BELOME

(swiping and clawing at

nothing possibly a

little brain damaged)
Where’dya go What was all dat
light You tink you can fool me
Nah nah nah ain’t nobody what can
fool Belome

Belome roars and charges at Luigi and Mallow

MALLOW
(a little nervous)
It takes a while to charge up

LUIGI
Get behind me

Mallow does and Belome SCREAM roars and opens his mouth to
swallow them whole when a massive fist comes sailing in like
a missile and hits him right between his four eyes

Belome goes smashing into a burning lily pad and disappears
underwater Funky Kong grins stepping up alongside Luigi

LUIGI
Ice cold home run my brother

FUNKY KONG
(bumps fists with Luigi)
It’s all good

Belome pops up out of the swamp his enormous spiked tongue
whipping at Funky Kong but it never reaches him dozens of
ninja stars hit it pinning it to the ground and then Toad’s
scimitar buries its blade in the bulbous tip

Toad and several Ninjii drop down from the trees Three big
Ratbombs plop into the water and the subsequent explosion
blows Belome up onto the shore in front of the group next to
his pinned-down tongue Mouser scurries up grinning

LUIGI
(bowing a little to Toad)
Sir Toad
TOAD
(doing a little mock
salute)

Super Luigi

LUIGI
(smiles at Mouser)
Lord Mouser

MOUSER
(nodding his head)
Sire

Belome struggles up to his feet completely mentally gone

BELOME
(muttering growling his
tongue still pinned down)
Ah thee you Ah thee ahl uf you
(makes a clumsy swing at
Luigi which he ducks
under)
Thay thill Thay thill Ah’1ll wip
yuh head oth

The group stares at Belome with equal parts pity and
disgust

LUIGI
(quietly)
Mallow you charged

MALLOW
Yeah

LUIGI
(looks at Mallow)
Yeah

Mallow raises his arms and dozens of little arcs of
electricity start going from place to place on Belome’s body

MALLOW
(loudly to his allies)
Shield your eyes

Everyone shields their eyes except for Toad He laughs and
nods this is his kind of stuff Everything seems to go
completely silent

BELOME
What’s dat smell

An enormous bolt of lightning so bright it seems to turn
everything white strikes Belome on the top of his head He
vanishes in sections first his fur then his skin then his
muscles then his nerves then his organs And finally all
that’s left is a little floating puff of yellow fur

Mallow frowns at the puff and a tiny lightning bolt zips
down and incinerates it

Dozens more Ninjii start appearing in the trees all around

them quiet reverent Everyone stands in silence looking
at each other beginning to realize the power they have if

they stand united

TOAD
(turning to Luigi)
Your orders

Luigi kneels down and picks up his pistol

LUIGI
Finish sweeping the swamp for
survivors and then get everyone on
the plane
(turns dramatic
holstering the revolver)
Next stop is the Mushroom City

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - COUNTRY ROAD - DESTROYED STOPOVER

A very tall sign reads “NESSA’S FRUITS’N’SUNDRIES” It’s a
little country stopover a few dozen miles outside the city
which can be seen as a blurry form in the distance
Everything has been reduced to rubble by Wario’s anarchist
Shy-Guys

A puttering little yellow dune buggy sits out front of the
rubble its engine coughing and wheezing Something is

rooting through the rubble of the shack but it’s not clear
what

We pan down and through the rubble of the produce shack to
reveal CONKER scavenging through the rubble an enormous
shack of loot on his shoulder his bushy tail twitching in
the pleasant twilight breeze

He picks up items and either puts them in his sack or tosses
them over his shoulder where they land with a crash in the
rubble behind him

CONKER
(singing happily in his
chirpy little voice)
Happy days are here again
(picks up little metal
trinket)
The apocalypse quite near again
(picks up a vase chucks
it over his shoulder)
Everyone trembling in fear again
(does a little tap dance)
And I’m so haaaaaaaaa-peee
(picks up a little framed
painting and tosses it
over his shoulder)
I got loot on my left loot on my
right

Conker sees something blue and tugs on it it’s the Geno
doll from Super Mario RPG

CONKER
(getting louder)
Got enough loot here to part-ay all
night

Conker looks over the doll and then throws it over his
shoulder

CONKER
Yes happy days are here
(realizes something’s
wrong)
Again

There was no crash the doll never landed Conker stops
dead and then turns very very slowly to see Mario
looking completely insane holding the doll

MARIO
Hello Conker

There’s a moments silence and Conker swallows deeply He
turns to run and Mario drops the doll and immediately
catches Conker by the tail Conker turns and punches Mario
in the face several times not phasing him at all

Conker yanks a giant machete out of nowhere and Mario swats
it away then lifts him easily by the tail leaving Conker
hanging upside-down at arms length

Conker looks at his big bag of loot and then swiftly hides
it behind his back This is totally ineffectual due to the
bag being at least twice his size

CONKER
(in a terrified falsetto
“puddy” voice)
Oh eh uh hi Mario whatja been
up to

Mario shakes Conker several times and dozens of rubies and
gold and silver coins fall out of his pockets along with a
significant amount of random trinkets and knick-knacks
Mario stares at Conker murderously and Conker’s big phony
smile falters

MARIO
Funny I seem to recall telling
you to leave and never come back

CONKER
Well uh yeah that
whole yeeeeeeaaaaaaaahhh
(quickly)
You see the thing is in the
current political climate I thought
that-

MARIO
You thought what

CONKER
I thoughtyah know

MARIO
I’d be busy with other things

CONKER
Ehehehehehe

MARIO
I can always find time for you
Conker

CONKER
(slowly losing his cool)
Well yeah
(scratches his little
squirrel ears nervously)
Apparently

Mario drops Conker on his head his bag of pillaged items
landing on top of him He scampers out from under it and
nervously straightens his head-fur

MARIO
But I’m in a hurry so Conker what
are we to do

There’s an explosion in the distance and Mario’s head whips
to the city on the horizon

CONKER
(quietly)
It’s happening ain’t it Wario’s
really gonna try to-

MARIO
Destroy everything Kill everyone
(quickly angry)
What are we going to do Conker

CONKER
Uhhhhhhhh
(very nervous)
Ehehehehehehehe

CUT TO CONKER
HANGING BY HIS
TAIL FROM THE
TOP OF THE
NESSA’S FRUITS
AND SUNDRIES
SIGN

Conker shakes and writhes furiously but Mario’s tied his
tail around the sturdy wooden post

CONKER
(struggling furiously with
the knot in his tail)
Mario You schmecking coward Get
back here and fight me like a man

Mario who’s down in Conker’s dune buggy looks up at Conker
Conker abruptly falls silent

MARIO
(insane yet somehow
cheery he’s getting to
his target)
You stay cool Conker

Conker smiles widely showing all of his teeth and gives the
thumbs up Mario puts the pedal to the metal and motors down
the road

CONKER
(going back to furiously
pulling at his tail)
Flompin’ gormel dorn can kiss my
firanbee damn self-righteous human
gehfleck thinks-

The tail unravels and Conker drops out of site and goes
crashing to the ground

CONKER (0OS)
(pained)
Schmeck

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - ALL THROUGHOUT THE CITY - SUNSET

As the sun begins to sink below the horizon the troops all
over the city prepare for the worst We go all over the
city watching the city as it braces itself for what very may
well be the killing blow

A Mole woman leads a group of Mushroom Koopa and Kong
children in a duck-duck-goose type of game Koopa Troops
march along the top of the walls grunting nervously A
group of Goombas and Mushroom soldiers stand guard at the
main gates staying in formation anxious and silent

A group of Kremlings hang out at an outpost in the city
singing a rowdy pirate ballad

A couple Mushroom troops are sharpening their swords looking
at a diagram drawn in crayon (clearly by the Princess) that
indicates that if the Shy-Guys point their guns at them they
should take cover A large battalion of Nimbans holding
Tridents and mace-type weapons hang out around their landed
city apparently unwilling to go out and guard the walls

Donkey Kong stands alone out on the walls staring out at
Wario’s now quite enormous army He eats a whole banana in
one bite and then throws the banana peel down off the edge
of the wall Diddy watches him from a nearby turret
nervously fiddling with a baby piranha plant

Down at the base of the walls at the end of the main-street
Bowser sits in a throne made of Shy-Guy masks He stares at
the gate unmoving a predator in his natural environment
ready for the attack anticipating it Maybe even eager He
licks his lips and his enormous teeth glint in the last rays
of sunshine

In a tavern nearby a group of Kong children is being
attended to by a Mushroom matron who though she’s maybe a
little nervous is being as loving and motherly as she can
At a table nearby King Kay Rool watches the children play
The sadness regret and level of self-disgust is palpable
There’s a moment of quiet contemplation and Kay Rool makes
up his mind He slams down his mug of ale and heads out the
door drawing his cutlass

On the tiers of the Nimban castle the Nimban Queen looks
over the combined cities and turns away looking at an
enormous tapestry portrait of her family with a very young
Mallow standing in between her and her husband holding their
hands smiling The Nimban King appears and seeing his
wife clearly breaking down takes her in his arms

Peach stands outside on the balcony outside of Craig’s
chambers at the Kline Castle squeezing the railing so hard
it’s bent completely out of shape Craig comes out and
stands next to her He very slowly takes her hand and they
squeeze very tight Inside Cranky Kong watches them and
smiles

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - SOUTH-EASTERN HILLS

Wario stands atop a tank one arm raised the other holding a
megaphone to his lips

WARIO
(whispering into the
megaphone giddy with
anticipation dropping
his arm)

And the final battle for the fate of the Mushroom Kingdom has
begun

Craig and Peach watch as the South-Eastern hills light up
with the cannon flares of hundreds of tanks and machine guns

CRAIG

INT GADD’S HOUSE - FOYER

There’s a knock at the door and then silence Footsteps
Gadd comes into frame looks out the peephole and then opens
the door revealing a uncomfortable looking Chet Rippo Chet
stands very still a sort of half-smile locked onto his face
displaying his broken teeth

GADD
What-

Daisy comes through the door out of nowhere slamming Gadd
against the wall and then throwing him to the ground face
down

GADD
What the hell-

DAISY
I don’t like being lied to Doctor

GADD
Get off me Lieutenant or I’1l
call the police myself-

DAISY
I have a warrant to search the

CHET

She does

GADD
Don’t be ridiculous you won’t find
anything here

DAISY
(pulling Gadd to his feet)
I don’t plan on it I’m just going
to trash the place

Daisy roughly leads Gadd down the hallway

GADD
Ms Miyamoto you’re unstable you
need to-

Daisy shoves Gadd onto the couch in his bizarre living room

DAISY
I need to you to shut the hell up
unless you’re spoken too is that
clear

GADD
Mr Rippo you’re going to be a
party to this this kidnap-

CHET
Hey seen some weird stuff and

Start answering

GADD
I called your precinct after your
little visit Daisuko-

DAISY

(losing it a little)

No first names Call me Lieutenant
Miyamoto

GADD
(quietly)
Right Lieutenant

Daisy sits down on the coffee table in front of Gadd and

Chet leans against the wall There’s a long silence with
Daisy staring at Gadd like she intends to disembowel him

Gadd cracks and abruptly stands up

DAISY
What’ re you-

GADD
If I’m going to tell you
everything we should get some
drinks

CHET
What

Gadd picks up a kettle with a little “SUPER MUSHROOM”
insignia on it

GADD
Won’t you two have some tea

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE SOUTHERN WALLS

The walls are under assault bright yellow and red explosions
shatter the thick stone apart throwing some Empire troops
off and to the ground straight up incinerating others

A Molemite covered in flames tumbles off a turret as Donkey
Kong monkey-runs past him DK grabs the burning Molemite by

its tail and tosses it into an animal trough where the water
extinguishes it

Another barrage comes in shattering a portion up ahead of
Donkey Kong He yowls and turns nearly getting taken out by
a shell in flight The artillery has started to come down on
the buildings just inside the wall enclosing whole portions
of it in gates of fire

A couple of Wario’s Honest John’s fire off their 12-Meter
missiles which sail up into the sky over the walls and
come smashing down into the residential district setting off
100 foot high explosions that shake the foundations of every
building in the city

One of them comes down short hitting the giant front gate
The entirety of the structure is engulfed in fire Donkey
Kong leaps across a break in the wall and grabs hold of a
Bullet Bill cannon He turns it to the tanks and yanks the
cord

DONKEY KONG
(screaming to the rest of
the troops)

RETURN FIRE

An enormous Bill leaps out of the cannon and soars at the
tanks as they roll along the giant field out front of the

in its jaws and flings it into the air

As more and more tanks roll in the Empire Troops scatter
fleeing and taking cover Those that don’t move fast enough
are machine-gunned by the hundreds of Shy-Guys that stand on
top of and run in between the tanks it’s a slaughter
Wario’s tank rolls in with him straddling the cannon
grinning watching the carnage

A couple Kremlings and Mushrooms armed with crossbows and
long-bows manage to take out a couple of Shy-Guys but then
Jonny Jones charges them and slashes them into bubbles and
spores Wario laughs but then stops as he notices that the
Empire Troops continue pulling back into the buildings out
of sight

WARIO

(quietly insulted)
Where are they going Where are
they going

(louder)
WHERE ARE THEY GOING

(screaming)
WHERE ARE THEY GOING WHERE ARE
THEY GOING WHERE ARE THEY-

An giant clawed hand comes swinging in out of nowhere and
strikes Wario across the face spinning him hard and knocking
him to the cobblestone road

BOWSER (0OS)
Silence child

Wario groans and rolls over Bowser was standing nearly
next to him he’s snaked his way through the tanks and now
stands within claws’ reach

He’s lost all of the veneer of nobility he usually carries
his nostrils bristle he’s down on all fours his eyes are
narrow and filled with a sort of bloody rage that is usually
the last thing a person will see before they’re killed by a
lion or an enraged bear

Bowser Koopa minus the title of King minus the crown and
the robe and all the fuss about honor is a straight up fire-
breathing baby-stomping skull-crushing MONSTER

WARIO
BowserDon’t do this join me we
can-

Bowser lurches forward belching a stream of bright yellow
fire at Wario who rolls out of the way under at tank
Bowser easily flips the tank over and Wario opens fire on
him with two submachine guns The bullets spark and ricochet
off Bowser’s armored hide and the Monster King throws back
his head and laughs

WARIO
Schmeck Schm-

Bowser smashes Wario with his tail sending him flying
through the front window of a tailors’ shop Jonny Jones
runs at him and Bowser swats him away like a pesky insect
and punches through the side of another tank

The closest of the tanks fires a shot that hits Bowser
directly in the chest the resultant explosion completely
engulfing him The smoke and fire clears and Bowser stands
tall a huge black scorch mark on his ribs

BOWSER
(coughing pained)
Is that all
(stronger)
IS THAT ALL

Bowser sinks his talons into the front of the offending tank
and with a great snarl of effort years it open like a tin
can and blows fire onto the Shy-Guys inside

BOWSER
(roaring to his troops)
They are weak They are nothing
Koopa Troopas
(roars)
CHARRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGEEEE

Koopas and Goombas pour out from seemingly everywhere
destroying and flipping tanks The Shy-Guys open fire using
not only their standard guns but also with M134 gatling guns
they’ve started to set up

More tanks are coming through the wrecked gates along with
many Shy-Guys on foot and some pushing howitzers which
they’ re firing seemingly at random into the city exploding
the Japanese style buildings like they’re made of tooth-
picks

One of the Goombas bites onto the cannon of an M109 and
twists it sharply The tank tries to fire and promptly
explodes catching two Goombas in the flame

Bowser grabs a tank flips it onto his back and then swings
it down onto a T-62 destroying both vehicles He belly
laughs and watches as his Koopa Troopas hold fast against
the tide of artillery

There’s an earth shattering BOOM and Bowser stumbles
confused He touches his chest and his paw comes up covered
in orange blood mixed with purple dust Bowser grunts and
turns to the source of the sound and sees Wario standing in
the tailor shop window holding a Harris M92 anti-tank rifle

Wario smiles and pulls the bolt ejecting the six-inch long
spent shell There’s a neat hole in Bowser’s chest leaking
his orange blood He roars and charges at Wario

BOOM

he muzzle flare alone is five feet long The bullet hits
owser in the shoulder and blows straight through him and
ut his back in a spray of orange blood and purple dust
owser stumbles back but then rights himself and roars
harging once more

QWoWH

w

OOM

he bullet strikes Bowser in the side of the head cracking
ff one of his horns Bowser is barely fazed despite the
act that part of his bloody skull is now exposed He leaps
hrough the shop window shattering the frame around his
massive body and shell and lands on top of Wario repeatedly
clawing his face and chest ripping ghastly horizontal gashes
open all over him

thoy

Wario shrieks in pain and manages to aim the gun and fires a
shot through Bowser’s neck Bowser collapses off of him
rasping wet breaths and then stops moving entirely

WARIO
Got ya

Wario stands up stumbling badly Bowser hurt him He spits
on Bowser’s body and then leaves the shop

We go in close on Bowser’s seemingly dead eyes He blinks

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - MAIN STREET

The battle continues the Koopa Troop is being beaten back
but is fighting hard purple dust and blue goop is starting
to cover the fronts of the tanks

A group of Mushrooms and Kremlings along the roofs of the
shops and buildings start to fire down with bow and arrows
and cross-bows it’s effective against the unprotected Shy-
Guys but has no effect on the tanks

A squad of Shy-Guys sets up a powerful Howitzer and fires it
up into the midsection of one of the buildings it explodes
in-halves the top half falling back onto the shops behind
it crushing dozens of Empire Troops

A couple of Mushrooms and Nimbans have gotten the inspired
idea to climb aboard the shell of a Koopa and are using it
as a mobile weapons platform firing off Nimban “lightning
rods” and a steady hail of lethal slingshot fire A tank
trains its gun on them and blows them to kingdom come

A group of Molemites appears from seemingly nowhere
burrowing up out of the ground between the tanks setting off
Mouser-type bombs in the undercarriages destroying some of
the older models but doing virtually no damage to the newer
United States Army behemoths

Up on the walls Donkey Kong is hurriedly helping to evacuate
the remaining defensive troops He leans over the edge and
looks down The sight is horrifying the gate is no longer
an entry point so much as it’s the focal point for a tidal
wave in-pouring of Wario’s army from outside the decimated
walls

Diddy Kong starts pushing explosive barrels down into the
swarm sending shattered Shy-Guy pieces in all directions A
few particularly bold Goombas leap down off the walls mouth
first gulping down Shy-Guys as they go but it’s not long
before they’re perforated with bullets and turned into
quivering blobs of blue goop

DONKEY KONG
Get off the walls everyone get off
the-

One of Bowser’s mammoth airships flies very low over the
wall the roar of its engine deafening out all other sound
Koopas and Molemites on the deck are shoving off big burlap
bags of explosives which strike like bombs on the troops
still outside of the city

The airship is being pursued by a few of Wario’s helicopters
the rest of which are flying deeper into the city than the
tanks have penetrated randomly destroying houses and
facilities with air-to-surface missiles

Looking at the helicopters Donkey Kong notices that large
groups of Shy-Guys have started climbing up the sides of
buildings taking up posts on the roofs where fire down into
the fracas with tripod machine guns

DONKEY KONG
(grabbing Diddy by the
arm)
They’re trying to take the high-
ground Diddy get the Kongs and
get to the roofs

Donkey Kong roars and leaps off the walls onto the tank
swats some of the Shy-Guys off and literally bites the heads
off of two more One of them catches him off-guard and
blasts him twice with a shotgun but a cutlass swings in and
slices off its arm promptly shattering it

KING KAY ROOL
(raising the cutlass above
his head)
ARRRRR

Donkey Kong roars his approval and they turn to face an
oncoming wave of Shy-Guys

Further mainstreet Wario is back on his tank pushing

through the Mushroom Troops like they aren’t even there
firing crazily with his submachine-gun He pulls out a green-
capped mushroom and pops it into his mouth the cuts on his
face and body promptly seal themselves leaving nobby
unpleasant scars

mayhem)

The last of Wario’s army is entering the city a

few rocket

launching batteries have been set up and are randomly firing
off shots at the Nimban cloud cities the Kline Castle and

Bowser’s two remaining Air-Ships

There’s the rev of a tiny motor and Conker’s yellow Go-Cart

comes flying up over a sloped piece of wreckage
Guys all turn and start firing at it

The Shy-

Mario goes flying out mid-air tiny wings protruding from

his cap (three ways to fly remember) dripping

with flower-

fire He makes an elegant arc back around towards the rocket
batteries and sprays them with fireballs the warheads
detonate and the whole gate-area goes up in a blaze of

blinding yellow light

Mario executes a tight loop drops butt-first on
draws two Sledge-Hammers from his belt-loops and
like axes each hammer eliminating three Shy-Guy
spins flinging fire in every direction picking

napping midst all the chaos

Mario ducks

INT THE FUN

pretty peaceful until THE FUNKY FLIER comes
hrough the clouds

Luigi and Toad have taken to riding shotgun Luigi gasps as
the city comes into sight it’s a complete warzone and

everything t
and rubble
no tanks or
that’s not w

hat isn’t openly on fire is belching smoke dust
Wario’s army has moved entirely into the city
helicopters remain outside the fallen walls But
hat’s so striking

What’s so horrible so panic attack inducing is actually
several hundred feet above the city at first it looks to be

just a gigan

tic cloud of smoke and debris but on closer

examination its true nature is revealed

it’s the Mushroom Kingdom’s version of a sea of corpses
Hundreds of thousands of spores purple dust so thick you can
barely see through it Nimban vapor at least twenty thousand
Kremling bubbles Kong leaves and a ton of Molemite wood-
chips have coagulated into a murky floating swamp above the
city

LUIGI
Oh

They’ re closing in on the city

FUNKY KONG

(quietly)
Looks like we missed the start of
the party

TOAD

(screaming over the wind)
We’re going to kill them

We’re going to kill each and every
one of them

FUNKY KONG
Where do I put the bird down my

LUIGI
(looking down into the
chaos)
Land it
(points)

There Right there

We turn to see that he’s pointing down at the embattled main-
street covered in advancing tanks and Shy-Guys and
retreating Koopa Troopas and Mushroom Calvary

FUNKY KONG
(laughing in disbelief)
Aw Luigi are you blowin’ your
wig Landin’ the plane there in
the middle of the fromby is some
off-time jive cat we’ll rip the
wings right off

Hold on to something

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

In the middle of the titanic battle that is being waged on
the main street one noise becomes dominant the roar of the
Funky Flier’s engines

The Mushrooms Moles Kremlings Nimbans Kongs and Koopa
Troopas see what’s coming and scatter but the Shy-Guys stand
transfixed by the incoming megalith like deer in the
headlights On a nearby rooftop Diddy Kong grabs at Donkey
Kong’s back as he pounds away at a group of Shy-Guys
shattering them left and right

DIDDY KONG
DK

DONKEY KONG
(turning a roar in his
voice)
WHAT
(he sees the plane and
speaks in a tiny voice)
Etro

The plane HITS CRASH LANDING THIS IS INSANE TANKS
FLIPPING INTO THE AIR LEFT AND RIGHT AS A C5 GALAXY RIPS ITS
WAY THROUGH WARIO’S ARMY SKIDDING OUT LIKE A WRECKING BALL
LEAVING ONLY DEVASTATION AND SHATTERED SHY-GUYS IN ITS WAKE
One of the wings cracks entirely off and tears through a
building then breaks into two smaller pieces and EXPLODES on
a group of tanks Minus one wing the Funky Flier slides to
a halt several dozen blocks from the Kline Castle

The battle seems silenced at least in this part of the city
A huge troop of Shy-Guys start slowly advancing on the
partially opened loading bay whilst Jonny Jones climbs up to
the cockpit brandishing a sword and a Desert Eagle Once he
gets there he finds that the cockpit is empty

JONNY
Eh Come out come out whereever ye
be ye little-

Funky Kong appearing behind Jonny laughs

FUNKY KONG
(winding up a punch just
like his brother)
Yo yard-dog

JONNY
(turning)
Wh-

Funky lets loose and hits Jonny HARD in the back knocking
him straight through the cockpit door through the cargo bay
and into the loading bay ramp knocking it all the way open
Jones crashes through the group of Shy-Guys distracting
them

Little arcs of electricity start going from place to place on
HUNDREDS of different pieces of Wario’s army and the Shy-
Guys turn to the now open cargo hatch to see Mallow standing
very still biting his puffy little lip concentrating hard

MALLOW
(throwing his arms up over
his head)
Zap

LONG SHOT IT’S ONLY ONE BOLT OF LIGHTNING BUT WITHIN
SECONDS IT’S HIT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF ITS DESIGNATED TARGETS
JAGGEDLY LEAPING FROM PLACE TO PLACE TRAVELLING OVER TWO
MILES EVISCERATING THE MACHINERY AND INCINERATING THE SHY-
GUYS

Mallow falls over unconscious as very suddenly the DOZENS
OF NINJIIS start to pour out around him flinging shuriken
and waving katanas Mouser pops out ahead of them all
drawing out his saber slicing one Shy-Guy in half and
thrusting through another

MOUSER
(caught up in the heat of
battle like a Napoleonic
general)
That’s right troops Get them
Get them No mercy for the savage
blighters Take no prisoners

The mass of Ninjiis are a genuinely intimidating force even
though a few are reduced to ashes (apparently what they turn
into when they die) by gunfire it’s little help the Ninjiis
are faster smarter and nimbler than the Shy-Guys and once
the regrouped forces of the Mushroom Empire join in the
Battle for the Mushroom City is no longer a slaughter

It is as predicted a goddamned brawl

EXT THE KLINE CASTLE - FRONT STEPS

Wario’s tank grinds to a halt and he pops out with Kamek in
tow

behind them in the city
and doing a double take)

Well yeth but-

WARIO

(points)
Go

Kamek takes a last reluctant look and then shuffles off
towards the mayhem We zoom out a little revealing that at
least four dozen Shy-Guys await Wario’s orders

WARIO
(grins)
Guess what time it is guys

The Shy-Guys moan and howl excitedly

WARIO
(shouting as though he’s
hosting a sporting event)
It’s winning time Get this door
open

A Shy-Guy with a PIAT Mortar Launcher gladly obliges firing
a single charge that streaks across courtyard into the
embattled door blowing it to pieces

WARIO
(watching as a bunch of
spores rise up from the
wreckage)
BOOM BOOM Did you see that
BOOM

Wario leads the way into the Grand Entrance Hall only to
find it abandoned

INT THE KLINE CASTLE - GRAND ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

Rubble and wreckage from the missile hits cover the ground as
Wario and his huge troop of Shy-Guys make their way inside

WARIO
(looking around)
What’s
(turns to the Shy-Guys)
Where is everybody

Craig pops up from behind a piece of wreckage and grabs
Wario by the throat with both hands choking him
intermittently shaking him like a rag-doll Wario gasps for
air but it’s no good the only person in the kingdom
physically stronger than Wario has him in a death grip

CRAIG

(a little looney if he

was physically younger

this would be a

“tantrum” )
You jerk you big jerkface this
was our place you don’t have the
right

Wario’s face is starting to turn purple and in desperation
he throws a few punches They bounce ineffectually off
Craig’s face though they do leave giant welts and bruises

Craig shakes Wario violently and then a Shy-Guy leaps onto
him followed by another and another and then five more
six more ten more until Craig is little more than a ball of
Shy-Guys punching and pulling at his arms

The Shy-Guys break Wario free and he drops to the ground
gulping in air

WARIO
(coughing)
Jesusalmost killed mecan you
believe it Freakin’ psycho

Craig flings the Shy-Guys off of him in a tangled heap and
dives at Wario again slamming him into the wall of the
castle several times choking the life out of him

Wario pulls out a gun from a hip holster and shoots Craig in
the stomach then punches him so hard he flies across the
entire Great Hall sliding into the bright red carpet and
then smashing into the grand staircase cracking the stone
steps

WARIO
Grab him Grab him

The Shy-Guys swarm Craig once more this time binding him
with ropes chains duct tape and bungee cord Fifteen
Mushroom soldiers run down the steps Wooster out ahead of
them

They fire off crossbows and are promptly killed by a hale of
bullets from the unoccupied Shy-Guys Wooster though he’s
hit in the thigh drops to one knee takes a second to aim
and shoots Wario in the knee

WARIO
AGH

Wario falls on his ass and shoots Wooster in the chest
causing him to burst into spores He tugs the arrow out and
gasps with pain whilst behind him the Shy-Guys massacre the
castle’s security forces

WARIO

to me

The Empire forces around the crash site are regrouping using
the enormous body of the crashed plane as their center of

command The tanks and howitzers are taking it to them hard
but it’s very clear that it’s not a one-sided fight any more

Luigi is trying to get through the crowds of Empire Troops
rushing to their aid with Toad in tow

TOAD
(shouting through the
fracas)
Luigi where’re you going

LUIGI
The castle

TOAD
What Why

LUIGI
Are you joking Once the castle
falls this city falls and I-

A blast of what appear to be randomly-colored chained-
together two-dimensional shapes catches Luigi in the chest
and sends him flying into the air into a store’s entry way
sign which cracks and folds around him

Toad yelps and dodges barely avoiding another shape blast
He looks up to see Kamek backed by at least fifty Shy-Guys
heading down the main-street from the castle his star-wand
held out in front of him like a deadly flare

TOAD

fallen Luigi)
It’s one of Wario’s goons Luigi

Jonny Jones steps in front of Toad grinning his shark’s
grin cutlass drawn Toad slides to a stop and looks Jonny
up and down Toad barely comes up to his knee

TOAD
(laughs)
Buddy you’re going to need a much
bigger sword

Toad whips out his scimitar and slices Jonny across the
chest causing a spurt of light-green foam Jonny roars and
lunges at Toad who repeatedly and easily parries his
attacks

TOAD
Come on you’ve got to try harder

As Jonny and Toad duel out of sight Donkey Kong leaps down
smashes some Shy-Guys and pulls Luigi out of the wreckage

Donkey Kong tucks Luigi under his arm and ducks into a
destroyed shop

DONKEY KONG
Good to see you man I heard tell
you was dead

LUIGI

No I’m alive I think
(notices Donkey Kong’s
wounds)

Jesus DK are you all right

A huge explosion goes off somewhere in the city and most of
the still standing sculptures fall and shatter

DONKEY KONG
They only pegged me a coupla times
I’1i be fine

You’ve been shot

DONKEY KONG
“Shot” Is that what it’s called

Another laser-chain of shapes flies past the window and
there’s another explosion

(ignoring Donkey Kong’s
question)
What the hell is that

DONKEY KONG
It’s a star wand chaotic
dangerous magic One of Wario’s
creeps musta bought it in Monstro

a little shocked)
There he is

Mario goes running by the window headed towards the castle

Wario grabs Peach by the jaw and forcibly kisses her

not a sexual kiss just a gesture of aggressive domination

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - FUNKY FLIER CRASH SITE -
CONTINUOUS

The battle rages on Mario ducks and dodges through a troop
of Shy-Guys easily shoving them out of his way shattering
faces and snapping guns when necessary Just as he sets into
a final sprint towards the castle an Apache helicopter
swoops down and around in front of him its gattling gun
blazing away cutting through the ground just ahead of Mario

MARIO
(quietly)
Damn it

Mario skids to a halt and abruptly changes direction running
behind the shops which the Apache takes apart It’s joined
by two more attack choppers and they chase Mario into the
burning commercial district

Meanwhile as Kamek continues blasting away at the Empire
Troops Toad and Jonny Jones are dueling up the remaining
wing of the Funky Flier Jones kicks Toad in the chest and
goes for the killing blow when Luigi leaps out of nowhere
and shoulder-checks Jones in the ribs sending him toppling
off the wing

TOAD
(annoyed)
I had that under control

LUIGI
(quickly)
Sure you did

TOAD
I was just toying with him I-

LUIGI
Hush We’ve got to get to the
castle so-

Jonny pops up next to Luigi and roars raising his sword
Toad pops up like a jack-in-the-box and cuts Jonny’s hand off
with a spurt of green foam and then chops of his head with
one clean cut His body teeters on the wing turning into
foam

Toad gives Luigi a pointed look and the body of Jonny Jones
falls down off the wing turning into foam as he falls The
downpour of foam lands on Kamek who’s proving himself a
force to be reckoned with killing Mushroom Kremlings
Molemites Nimbans and Kongs with abandon The foam stuns
him and knocks him off balance

amek shrieks in terror and fires off a blast of magic at a
charging Dixie Kong Kay Rool appears out of nowhere getting
in between the blast and Dixie He stumbles back gasping
Donkey Kong charges at Kamek who charges the wand with power
and hits Donkey Kong in the chin with it sending him
flipping painfully into the side of the Funky Flier

Diddy leaps onto Kamek’s back and starts struggling with him
but Kamek throws him off and aims another magic blast

KAMEK
(pointing his wand at
Diddy)
Thtay away from me idioth I’1ll
blow you all away

Kay Rool shoves Diddy out of the way and gets hit in the
chest AGAIN knocking him on his back Mouser pops up
alongside Kamek and slashes at him with his rapier slicing
open Kamek’s robe and then throws down a Rat-Bomb at Kamek’s
feet the explosion from which throws him onto his back

MOUSER
(swinging his sword)
Have at thee

Kamek raises the wand and blasts Mouser into the air He
starts to take aim once more when Kay Rool sinks his cutlass
into the side of Kamek’s wand

KAMEK
No You thtupid animal what’ve
you done

KING KAY ROOL
(booming)
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Kamek releases a jagged blast of dark-matter which blows a
hole straight through King Kay Rool He stumbles away and
falls but tugs his sword thus taking the wand with him

KAMEK
No My Thtar Wand

Funky Kong swipes at Kamek knocking him back but not
hurting him

KAMEK
Hah You mithed me

Kamek turns to see that he now stands directly next to the
tree-trunk leg of Donkey Kong

KAMEK
OhUh

He looks around and sees Kay Rool who’s struggling to stand
up grin and wave him goodbye

KAMEK
Thmeck

Donkey Kong slaps down an enormous palm and Kamek goes up in
a puff of yellow dust He laughs a gorilla laugh smiling at
Funky Diddy looks on nervously wondering how long the
positive reaction will last

Kay Rool bursts into bubbles and disperses up into the sky
Donkey Kong snarls frustrated if not bereaved and then
notices a formation of helicopters and another wave of tanks
swift approaching He roars to the troops around him

INT THE KLINE CASTLE - GRAND ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS
Wario prattles on

WARIO
(gesticulating wildly with
his gun as he talks)
So there I was alone in the
Darklands my left leg broken a
Chain Chomp at my heels-

CRANKY KONG
(quietly but carefully
annunciating every word)
We don’t care

WARIO
(totally baffled)
What

CRANKY KONG
The King the Princess and I have
no interest in further indulging
you So please shut up

Wario stands stock still Cranky’s calm adult manner has
completely thrown him off his groove It’s as though a
parent just caught him at play with his friends in the
backyard he doesn’t know whether to be embarrassed or angry
or both He chooses angry

WARIO
(his face turning bright
red spluttering)

(MORE)

WARIO (contd)
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM I’m the boss
now I won the war I am the Red
King This is Super Wario Land

CRANKY KONG
No I’m afraid it isn’t You see
you haven’t really “won” anything
Wallace

WARIO
(pointing his gun in
Cranky’s face)
SHUT UP

Cranky takes a moment to look at the gun with a sort of mild
distaste the way one would look at dog feces stuck to the
bottom of their shoe

CRANKY KONG
Please Don’t waste time pointing
that at me

WARIO
I’ll kill you

CRANKY KONG

(laughing softly)
Oh I have no doubt But you’ll
never win not really Even if you
kill every being in this city
you’1l still have beaten yourself
youve brought this world together
in a way not even Mario could
You’ve reformed the great Mushroom
Empire The destruction you’ve
wrought is merely physical after
your pathetic sagging form has
left our world the harm you’ve
done can be repaired

WARIO
Shut up Shut up

Cranky Kong bows his head

CRANKY KONG
If you wish Wallace You’re in
charge

WARIO
You’re damn right You’re damn
right I am And now

(MORE)

WARIO (contd)
(shakes his head violently
and rubs his temple
psychotic)
One of you has to die Yes
(raises a finger in the
air)
One of you will die But who Who
dies first Hm let me think
(putting the gun against
each of his captive’s
heads in turn starting
with Cranky)
Eenie meenie miney mo catcha
tiger by the-

Wario very suddenly turns and shoots Cranky Kong in the
chest He doesn’t cry he doesn’t scream or gasp or shout
he merely smiles a calm smile as he turns into leaves

Peach starts hysterically screaming whilst Wario cackles
mad as a hatter Peach tries to stand but is held down by
the dozens of Shy-Guys

WARIO
(shooting a few of Crank
Kong’s leaves down out of
the air doing a little
dance)
Woohoohoo I’m kah-raaazy

PEACH
(trying to recover)
You won’t be laughing when Mario
get’s here

WARIO
(suddenly vicious)
Mario’s dead I killed him

PEACH
(quietly)
Have you seen the body

WARIO
WellNo but-

PEACH
(sniffling)
You could never kill him

WARIO
Shut up
(shakes his head furiously
and stomps)
(MORE)

WARIO (contd)
Yes I could I did Stop
interrupting me I’m-

PEACH
Yeah you’re a big man now but
he’11 cut you down to size

WARIO
(laughs relaxing a
little)
Oooh Shirrelles lyrics
Terrifying I’m nearly afraid to-

BOWSER () comes CRASHING through the wall charging in out
of ABSOLUTELY FREAKING NOWHERE and brutally claws Wario
across the chest He roars at the Shy-Guys holding Peach
and they scatter Wario falls down over by the stained glass
windows gasping holding his chest Bowser falters weak
from blood loss Bowser gives a sad smile to Peach then
collapses

WARIO
(coughing gripping his
bloody wounds)
Stay down this time lizard

Peach freed screams a deep primal animal noise and
tackles Wario through a gigantic stained glass portrait of
herself out onto a lower balcony The Princess is angry

EXT THE KLINE CASTLE - LOWER TIER BALCONY GARDEN -
CONTINUOUS

Peach lands on top of Wario as they tear a rift through a
garden of fire flowers She buries a few surprisingly strong
punches into his face and then grabs a handful of fire-
flowers and shoves them into her mouth

Within seconds she’s covered in thick wet flame dripping
off her and into the garden lighting everything on fire
Wario shrieks and scrambles out of the way as Peach begins
throwing fireballs

Peach rips off her dress revealing pink sweatpants and
catches Wario with a fireball in the chest knocking him back
into a garden of WHITE SNAPPERS which bite and chew at him
before he pulls free and stumbles directly into a roundhouse
kick to the face from Peach

Wario trips along stunned as Peach punches him in the head
knees him in the groin headbutts him in the nose and then
throws him face down against the balcony railing

Peach grabs Wario by the hair and the chin and pulls his head
up forcing him to look out at the burning chaos that once
was the Mushroom City

PEACH
(screaming)
Is this what you wanted Wallace
Is this how you wanted it to be

WARIO
(smiles and speaks
weakly)

Oh we’re south of heaven now
Patricia It’s beautiful

He turns and in one motion buries his knee into Peach’s
stomach and punches her savagely in the face

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT OUTSIDE
THE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

It’s the commercial sector filled with the cities tallest
buildings topping out at around fifteen stories Mario is
ducking and weaving from fruit cart to storefront barely
avoiding the machine gun fire from the helicopters His face
is still frozen in the angry snarl

A group of Mushroom and Nimban Infantry up on the rooftops
lift steel mesh bolo-style nets and hurl them down at the
low-flying helicopters below It’s mostly ineffectual and
the infantry are reduced to spores by machine gun fire but
one of the nets catches in the rotors of a Merlyn copter and
it goes spinning out of control to the ground and explodes
incinerating a group of Shy-Guys and spraying lit fuel onto
the street

Mario ducks past the fire fights his way through a couple
more Shy-Guys and then crosses the main-street running
directly into the side of an AMX-30 tank Wario’s AMX-30
tank parked out front of the castle He looks up and sees
Peach and Wario fighting on the balcony which is now
engulfed in flames

Wario smashes Peach’s head against the wall several times
and then holds her by the throat out over the side of the
balcony A helicopter swoops down towards Mario and
launches a stinger missile

MARIO
No

Mario leaps up at the missile USES IT AS A JUMPING PLATFORM
IN MID-FLIGHT lands atop one of the helicopter’s blades and
harshly bends it upwards as it spins him around uses the
momentum to throw him onto a tall flagpole attached to the
balcony slides down the flagpole leaps off at its
midsection drop-kicks a very surprised-looking Wario in the
chest grabs the Princess swings her up onto the balcony and
assumes a fighting position

PEACH
(quietly)
Wow

Wario struggles to his feet his knee still shaky from
Wooster’s arrow He’s so enraged it’s nearly comical (but
mostly scary) spit flying out of his mouth as he talks his
eyes bugging out of his head hair wild his face red and
swollen

WARIO

(like someone is twisting

a screwdriver into his

tongue)
NO NO wWNo

(screams)
You are NOT INVITED This is NOTA
MARIO PARTY YOU CAN’T-

MARIO
(flying at Wario)
SON OF A BITCH

Mario Versus Wario round four begins It’s not going to be
pretty

Mario’s punch hits Wario straight in the chest you can
almost see kinetic waves off the impact and Wario is thrown
back inside the castle

INT THE KLINE CASTLE - GRAND ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

Wario flies in and lands on his back rolling past Craig
who’s white from blood loss Mario leaps around forty feet
from the outside of the castle to land next to Wario who he
kicks repeatedly before pulling him to his feet using his
ribs as a punching bag and then picking him up and slamming
him to the ground again and again After the sixth slam
Mario spins him around and puts him in a headlock

MARIO
You feel that Wallace That’s all
of the people you’ve killed
squeezing in on your throat

WARIO
(choked)
I haven’t killed any people

Wario flips Mario off of him but Mario lands on his feet and
mule-kicks Wario in the neck flooring him

CRAIG
(weak)
He killed Masrafo

MARIO
(blinking)
He killed Cranky
(looks at Wario who’s
emergency room material
at this point)
You killed Cranky

Mario pulls Wario up and punches him in the face Again

And again And again He pulls him up again and Wario
pulls out a tazer and zaps Mario in the neck Mario screams
and falls back and Wario recovering a little tazers him
again He pulls a green Mushroom out of his pouch and holds
it out in front of him as Mario twitches on the ground

WARIO

(very weakly)
You ever seen one of these little
green guys I found them out in
the Darklandsthey’re tons of
fun See just one

(pops it into his mouth

and chews)
And you’re fresh vegetables

And Wario is indeed as good as new all of his cuts close
his missing teeth grow back and his swollen bruises vanish

MARIO
(quietly)
Oh god
WARIO

I can do this all day

Wario hits Mario square in the stomach with one of his mega-
punches bending him double then uppercuts him in the jaw

The force of the blow sends Mario forty feet up to the roof
of the hall which he smashes against

He drops down clearly almost knocked out and crashes to the
ground just in front of Wario Wario draws a pistol but
Mario Capoiera-kicks it out of his hand snap-kicks him in
the legs repeatedly and then goes to punch him in the face

Wario ducks and slugs Mario in the jaw sending him skidding
into a pile of rubble Wario shouts something incoherent and
angry and dives at Mario who kicks him in the face

Wario flips mid-air from the impact of the kick and hits the
prostrate Bowser’s shell with more impact than could possibly
be comfortable Mario leaps up next to him and Judo-hip-
tosses Wario back-first onto one of Bowser’s shell spikes
impaling him

WARIO
AAAAGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH

Mario stares at him for a moment as he twitches and screams
and then drops down to see Peach who’s running towards him
Then embrace and kiss

PEACH
(pulling back a little)
I knew you’d come I did I knew
the whole time you’d be here to
rescue us I-

There’s a gunshot and Peach falls back shot in the side
Mario immediately drops down next to her Wario still
impaled on the spike laughs

WARIO
Gotcha

Wario pulls himself sloooco00000000wly up off the spike
bleeding badly and pops another green Mushroom into his
mouth His wound heals instantly Mario starts to stand up
and Wario punches him down next to the Princess who’s
coughing very painfully Mario lays there staring at the
ceiling

WARIO
What that’s it

Wario draws compressed-submachine-gun and aims it at Mario
as he tries to get up

WARIO
Kind of anticlima-

Toad bounces by a sword in each hand slicing both Wario’s
gun in half and destroying his bag of green mushrooms

WARIO
Wh-

Luigi appearing behind Wario grabs him by the ankles spins
him around twice and hurls him face first into the stone
wall cracking it Wario lays motionless on the floor for a
little while as Luigi and Mario stare at each other

MARIO
(in shock)
I thought you were dead

LUIGI
I was
(smiles lamely)
But I’m better now

Mario grins stands up and joyously hugs his brother who to
his own surprise hugs him back It’s a big moment

Wario slowly pushes himself to his feet dark blood rushing
over his face like a crimson mask Luigi and Mario break
apart and take aggressive fighting stances Bowser rises up
from his prone position standing behind the Super Mario
brothers Toad flips up from the side drawing his scimitar
sword as he lands in between the brothers Mario looks at
his behind him and then turns to Wario grinning

MARIO
(to Wario)
WellNow you’re really screwed

Bowser chortles and wipes some blood off his brow Wario
coughs and then smiles really quite horrifying at this
point

WARIO
(laughing insanely)
NO I do not LOSE NOT YET

Wario reaches into his pocket and brings out a glowing
shape

MARIO
(very quickly)
Oh

LUIGI
What What’s wrong

TOAD
(out of the side of his
mouth)
He’s got a star

Wario cackles insanely and shoves the star into his mouth
and very suddenly he appears to be made of pure radiant
shimmering beautiful light

EXT CASSAVETTES RESIDENCE - YARD

Gadd leads Daisy and Chet into the yard

DAISY
Mario’s house
GADD
YeahActually I got a little

lost
(notices the path into the
woods)

Ah here we go

Gadd starts down to the path and Chet starts to follow him
but Daisy touches his arm

DAISY
Chet

CHET
(still nervously rubbing
at his mouth)
Yeah

DAISY
Right now we’re still in the
Twilight Zone But If things get
X-Files
(reaches into her coat and
pulls out a can of mace)
I want you to have this

CHET
Mace

DAISY
In case stuff gets weird

CHET
(loudly incredulous
after a long pause)
Weird

GADD
(yelling to them)
Are you two planning to join me

Chet and Daisy start down the path

EXT KLINE CASTLE

The battle for the city rages all around and then up from
the top of one of the spires Bowser comes smashing through
the wall Just as a small troop of Mushrooms is being run
down by a Wildcat APC Bowser crashes down on top of it
crushing the West German battle-tank like a soda can under
his weight King Koopa is finally down for the count

INT KLINE CASTLE - GRAND ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

Mario Luigi and Toad are runningjumpingdivingrolling all
over the place trying not to let Wario who looks like a
sparkling human lightbulb get his hands on them This is
proving to be harder than it sounds Wario is bouncing around
like a superball As soon as one adversary is out of his
reach he dives for the next He finally corners Luigi and
Mario and Toad scramble to help him

MARIO
Don’t let him touch you

Toad pounces forward swinging down the scimitar through
Wario’s hat cutting it in two But as the blade touches
Wario’s head a very odd thing happens it’s as though the
sword has been hit by lightning

For a moment it vibrates at supersonic speed then explodes
apart shattering like glass The charge from the destroyed
blade shoots down through the handle and into Toad who’s
quite literally zapped across the room into a stone
outcropping which he bounces off in a very unpleasant
crunchy manner and then lays still on the ground smoke
wafting up off him like fresh barbecue

LUIGI
Toad

WARIO
(screaming as he lunges at
Luigi)
GOTCHA

Wario throws a haymaker at him but Mario yanks Luigi out of
the way and Wario’s fist hits the wall

Again the peculiar lightning-strike effect occurs at first
the wall vibrates super fast around Wario’s fist and then a
ripple passes over it and it explodes debris flying
everywhere

The ripple travels up the wall and hits the huge and
intricate stained glass windows which rip themselves apart
and send shards of glass and steel down onto the battle still
raging outside the castle

Mario hooks Luigi under his arms and bounces up onto the
chandelier

LUIGI
What the hell is happening

MARIO
He ate a fallen star it gives you
temporary invulnerability We
can’t touch him we should go

LUIGI
What Run away We can’t just
leave Toad-

MARIO
We’re not running away Luigi
That idiot will follow us forget
about everything else we’ve got to
get him out of the castle
somewhere where we can get the
advantage

LUIGI
I don’t understa-

There’s an insane cackle from below and Wario comes crashing
up through the chandelier sending fragments of crystal
ornaments in every direction

WARIO
(screaming perched on a
higher tier of the
chandelier)
This is my castle now You can’t
hide from me

LUIGI
Jesus-

Mario grabs Luigi by the seat of his pants and dives off the
side of the chandelier and hits the ground running

Wario leaps after them but only after slashing the
chandelier’s support cord with his machete sending it
smashing into the ground

Wario lands on all fours bounces back up and hurls the
machete end over end into the back of Mario’s knee Mario
goes down hard bouncing his head off the stone flooring
Luigi stumbles up and grabs Mario by the arm

LUIG
Mario Mario
MARIO
(reaching down to his leg)
Go go
LUIG
I can’t leave you
MARIO
(annoyed)

I didn’t mean leave me jack-ass
pick me up

LUIGI
(quietly)
Oh right

Luigi grabs Mario and slings him over his shoulder and
starts tearing ass down the hallway which is very suddenly
riddled with bullets Wario has drawn an Uzi and is giving
manic bouncing chase everything he touches vibrating and
then exploding apart

INT THE KLINE CASTLE - HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS

Luigi sprints down the hallways Mario over his shoulder the
sound of vibrating explosions not far behind

LUIGI
Which way

MARIO
Left

Luigi leaps into the air kicks off a wall and bounces down a
corridor to the left

INT THE KLINE CASTLE - THE PIPE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Luigi runs into the pipe room It’s total chaos several

tanks have rolled in through the larger entrances and are
being attacked by Mushrooms Koopas and Kremlings manning

trebuchets

A couple of Shy-Guys with pistols and shotguns are

successfully stopping help from outside the castle although
one or two are hit with arrows and thrown rocks Luigi leaps
down to the Pipe-Room floor and hurriedly takes cover behind
a yellow pipe

LUIGI
(setting Mario down
spinning on his heels
looking at the all pipes)
Which one which one

Wario burst through the door still glowing and throws out
four grenades at random Two of them hit Empire Troops
wreaking death and mayhem one of them scorches the giant map
of the Mushroom Kingdom on the wall and the last lands in a
pipe and goes off bending it a little

Wario lands on the floor maybe twenty feet away from The
Super Mario Brothers drawing a desert eagle cackling A
Nimban rushes at him with a trident and Wario shoots him in
the face reducing him to vapor

WARIO
Come out come out wherever you
are

A Mushroom woman leaps off a pipe above Wario wielding a
sledgehammer but as soon as she touches Wario’s glowing body
she bursts into spores

MARIO
(thinking)
We’ve got to give ourselves the
advantage

LUIGI
How Mario how do we do that

Mario painfully yanks the machete out of the back of his
knee limpingly stands and steps out from behind the pipe
He chucks the machete at Wario and it bounces off of his
shimmering form the blade bursting into shards

MARIO
(pained)
Hey Wally

WARIO
(smiling insanely)
There you are

MARIO
(grabs his brother’s arm)
Hold on tight

Mario bends his legs screams and bounces into the air over
the pipes dragging a screaming Luigi up with him

EXT NEW JERSEY - THE WOODS - TREE HOUSE CLEARING -
CONTINUOUS

Gadd steps into the clearing followed by Daisy and Chet
It’s getting cloudier out and the day is taking an even
grayer hue than the real world usually has

GADD
(turning spreading his
arms wide)
Here we are

Daisy looks the pipe up and down cynically

CHET
So we justGo in the pipe like
you said and poof

GADD
(smiles)
Poof Alternate dimension

DAISY
Of Mushrooms and Dinosaurs

GADD
(smiles)
That’s right

DAISY
(looks down and then
looks up)
All right Let’s go I’m-

Mario and Luigi come launching up out of the pipe and land
painfully on the forest floor of dry leaves and twigs

Daisy not seeing who just came out of the pipe grabs Gadd
and ducks behind a the big dead tree Luigi groans and
starts to stand up

CHET
(pale)
Holy cow

LUIGI
(bloodied and filthy
noticing Chet)
Chet

CHET
I-

Wario comes flying up out of the pipe does a neat flip in
the air and lands between Chet and Luigi He punches Chet in
the face with brass knuckles badly breaking his nose and
then grabs Luigi by the throat and starts beating the high
holy hell out of him punching him kicking him and throwing
him to the ground

MARIO
WALLACE

Wario turns Mario sticks out his tongue and gives Wario a
raspberry

WARIO
You

Daisy looks out from behind the tree and sees Wario chasing
a limping Mario his uzi raised

WARIO
(absolutely lunatic)
Get back here you piece of shit
You ruined it You ruined
everything

Wario takes some pot shots at Mario who is hit twice in the
back and falls Behind the tree Daisy turns to Gadd

DAISY

Run

(Gadd hesitates)
Go

Gadd runs off down the path and Daisy comes out from behind
the tree drawing her pistol

DAISY
NYPD HANDS IN THE AIR

WARIO
(turning)
Who-

DAISY
(advancing on him)
Weapon down Hands in the air

WARIO
(hysterically screaming)
SCREW YOU

Wario starts to raise the uzi and Daisy fires once hitting
Wario in the chest Wario falls like a rock

There’s a long moment of silence
Daisy starts to lower her gun but Wario pops up and empties

the uzi hitting Daisy several times in the chest and the
arms She falls

LUIGI
(standing up very pained
breathing hard)
What
(sees Daisy and his face
contorts into an ugly
combination of shock and
horror)
Daisy
(stumbles over to her)
No no oh god oh jesus no oh
god

Luigi collapses onto her moaning and sobbing Wario slowly
stands and starts towards Mario when he’s very suddenly hit
in the face by a stream of mace from a very injured but very
pissed off looking Chet Rippo And as he screams and claws
at his face he’s not Super Wario any more He’s just plain
old scared little Wallace Pike

WALLACE
(screaming)
No It’s not fair It’s not-

Mario pops up very suddenly swinging his last sledge hammer
into Wallace’s face something he could easily shrug off in
the Mushroom Kingdom

But not in our world
424

The steel tears Wallace’s skin like paper fracturing his
skull breaking his jaw and shattering his cheekbone and left
eye socket all in one devastating impact Wallace still
riding the adrenaline (and half-pushed by the blow) manages
to stumble away groaning and ranting through the pain
making a bee-line for the pipe

MARIO
(spitting blood)
Don’t let him get back Get him
Luigi Get him

Luigi let’s loose with an animal scream musters the last of
his strength (which honestly isn’t much at all by this point)
and dives onto Wallace’s back as he climbs the pipe’s ledge
sending them both flying into the darkness

INT PIPES - CONTINUOUS

Wallace tries to shove Luigi away as they hurtle towards a
pipe spray-paint marked “MUSHROOM FIELDS” beyond which is
only fire Luigi however holds firm and manages to push
them away altering their course

EXT DARKWORLD - THE ENDLESS WASTELANDS - CONTINUOUS

It’s just as dark evil and terrifying a place as it was when
Wallace first was exiled there in 1988 Luigi and Wallace
are spit out next to a lava flow and both of them nearly go
in but Wallace recovering his strength and endurance as the
world’s physics set in climbs up onto the black ground and
looks back at Luigi

WALLACE
(laughing excruciatingly
painful to listen to)
And once again I make my escape-

BLAM Wallace SCREAMS and stumbles back clutching the
place where his right ear used to be

WALLACE
Aaah
(realizing what happened)
AAAAHHHHH

Luigi pulls himself up shaking his cowboy revolver
outstretched and smoking

WALLACE
(shocked gasping his
wounds finally truly
effecting him slurring
badly)
Youasshole

LUIGI
(standing tall gun
trained on Wallace’s
head)
I’ve been called worse by better
than you I’ve got one bullet
left

WALLACE
(smiling a badly broken
smile)
Please

Wallace stands up drawing a glock with a laser sight He
places the aimer-dot right between Luigi’s eyes Luigi
stands there shaking his finger trembling on the trigger

WALLACE
You’ re pathetic

Divine inspiration strikes Luigi David Cassavettes

LUIGI
(screaming)
KIRBY TAKE HIM TO NIGHTMARE LAND

Nothing happens Luigi gulps Wallace shrugs and fires the
glock straight at Luigi’s head JUST AS a very very strong
wind starts up blowing towards Wallace Luigi yelps and
ducks afraid of the shot (of course this makes no sense as
you wouldn’t have time to yelp much less duck) Nothing
happens

WALLACE
(genuinely confused but
probably also a little
brain damaged)
What

The breeze intensifies and Luigi peeks up at him The
bullet hangs in the air slowly being pushed back towards
Wallace

WALLACE
What What Oh no no no

Wallace turns around to see KIRBY STANDING FIVE YARDS BEHIND
HIM his entire front half a swirling vortex his mouth
reaching a circumference of eight feet

LUIGI
(very quietly)
Oh wow

The suction into Kirby is insane like a black hole Just
beyond his mouth in the darkness we can see Nightmare Land
its foul creatures snapping and hissing

WALLACE
(rabid)
No NO IT DOESN’T END LIKE THIS
No

The suction intensifies tenfold and Wario is lifted off his
feet and sucked into Kirby’s mouth He turns at the last
second and grabs onto a rocky outcropping with one hand his
legs inside of Kirby He tries to bring up his other hand
but can’t

Luigi stands up from his cowering position as the vortex
retracts into Kirby’s and intensifies even more Luigi walks
over to him a little numb and looks at Wario lifting his
revolver and levelling it at Wallace’s head Wallace starts
screaming insanely cackling shrieking genuinely demented

WALLACE
Go on Do it DO IT

Luigi very suddenly retrains his gun on Wallace’s hand the
only thing holding him in the real world

WALLACE
What
(realizing what’s
happening)
No wait-

Luigi shoots Wallace in the hand and he goes flying into
Nightmare Land The vortex closes Kirby inverting and
vanishing into it Luigi stands there trembling breathing
hard and rolls out the chamber of the revolver dumping the
empty shells

LUIGI
Okay Okay Good

Luigi flops down onto his butt staring at the lava and the
pipe in front of him

LUIGI
Good All right Okay

Luigi flops onto his back his legs still half up bent He
lays there staring at the red and yellow Darkworld sky and
slowly closes his eyes

FADE TO WHITE

Cut to black A silence And then

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY - MORNING

It’s a new dawn in the Mushroom Kingdom sure the city is
positively decimated and fires still rage in several areas
but for the most part the fighting is over There’s the
occasional burst of gunfire followed by shouting and either
a lightning strike the twang of an arrow being let loose or
the BOOM of one of Mouser’s bombs

The Koopa Troop is staging a mass exodus from the city
amazing to look at Leading them out in front is King Bowser
Koopa covered in bandages his arm in a sling He stops for
a moment and looks back at the city He lets a smile slide
onto his face for just a moment and then turns back to the
long road home

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE BEACH

Craig walks along looking over the water Kay Rool’s first
mate Donal slowly approaches him

tri-corner hat and
holding it to his chest)

(splitting at the seams)
Oh righto sir thankye sir

you was injured in combat with
Wario

CRAIG
I’1l be fine Donal
(lays back in the sand
running it through his
fingers He loves this
world)
I’ll be fine

INT THE NIMBAN CITY - THE NIMBAN THRONE ROOM

The Nimban King and Queen are dressed in all black as are
all their attendants The grand doors to the throne room

open revealing Mallow Mouser and the Princess
Queen almost faints and the Nimban King stands
runs into his parents arms all of them crying
rainbow forms above them It’s corny but they

The Nimban
up Mallow
as a small
can’t help

it it’s biological Peach smiles and happily cries even

Mouser dabs his eye with a handkerchief

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE LANDED NIMBAN CITY

Peach and Mouser walk down the ramp to ground level as all
around them Nimbans Mushrooms Nomadimice Molemites
Sharkem Froggix Kremlings Beans Ninjii Kongs and Crokies
work together repairing the city Even Croco is lending a
hand

MOUSER
How goes the clean up princess

PEACH
Better than expected I’d think
There are still a few helicopters
roaming around outside the city
but once their fuel runs out they
shouldn’t be a problem

A group of Shy-Guys (and Shy-Girls surprisingly) are marched
by maskeless and bound tightly together with ropes

MOUSER
Once Wario fell they justgave
up
PEACH
(softly)
Once the head is severed the body
falls

(shouts up to the person
leading the group)
Where’re you taking them Banjo

BANJO of the immensely popular Mario spin-off series Banjo
Kazooie turns around the last and most blatantly fan-
pleasing cameo of the story

BANJO
Pipe room Princess We figure
we’1ll ship’em back to Darkworld I
think they’ve learned their lesson

PEACH
(smiles)
One would hope
(Banjo nods and goes on
leading the group of Shy-
Guys Peach turns back
to Mouser)
Mallow should do wonders in getting
the Nimbans to stay don’t you
think

MOUSER
Of course the return of the prince
is nothing short of miraculous
Not to mention that he fought
valiantly in the battle for the
kingdom

They pass a group of Mushrooms led by Dr Gadd collecting
Shy-Guy cloaks and masks and putting them in wheel barrows

PEACH
(waves nonchalantly to
Gadd who smiles at her)
He wasn’t the only hero in the
battle Althorp

MOUSER
Eh

PEACH
I heard that you personally risked
your life multiple times in defense
of this city

MOUSER
(awkwardly bashful)
Well I-
PEACH

Don’t get modest I’d like to ask
you back into my service Lord
Althorp as Secretary of Defense

They pass a flipped tank being dragged by two Sharkem and a
team of Molemites A lone Mushroom child pushes furiously on
at the back

MOUSER
(in shock)
But Princess I don’tAfter my
betrayal how could you-

PEACH
As I recall the reason for your
insurgence was that you did not
believe in following the orders of
children

Peach grins as they walk past a crashed helicopter which
several Nimbans and a Kong are trying to dislodge froma
storefront

PEACH
Do I look like a child Althorp

Mouser realizes that he best not look a gift horse in the
mouth

MOUSER
(dropping to his knees)
Princess I don’t know how to-

PEACH
(easily pulling him to his
feet)
Cut that crap and get to work I
want every gun tank and helicopter
in this city brought to the pipe
room

MOUSER
Why Princess

PEACH
We’re going to send them back to
our world where they belong

EXT THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM - THE WALLS

Donkey and Diddy Kong are working to extricate survivors from
the rubble and Etro Kong cautiously approaches

FUNKY KONG
HeySamala

DONKEY KONG
(standing up)
You ain’t forgiven if that’s what
you’re looking to hear

FUNKY KONG
I don’t know what I’m lookin’ to
hear Samala

Diddy Kong looks from brother to brother nervously

DONKEY KONG
Father is dead Etro Wario killed
Aim

FUNKY KONG
(softly)
I heard that I wish we could’ve
been there

DONKEY KONG
The Princess and the King wuz
there if they couldn’t stop it
you an’ me couldn’ta done nothing
either

FUNKY KONG
(sadly)
You’re probably right
There’s a nervous pause
DIDDY KONG
(chirpy)
It sure is sunny out today
Both Donkey and Funky look at him coldly
DIDDY KONG
(breaking down)
Father is dead
Funky takes Diddy in his arms

FUNKY KONG
Come here little Damar

Donkey takes a long look at Funky
DONKEY KONG

(quietly smiling)
You came back brother

FUNKY KONG
I did

Donkey Kong breaks down and hugs his two brothers

We pan out up and to the highest tier of the Kline Castle
Peach stands looking out over the city and then turns to
see Mario leaning against the granite wall

MARIO
Hey Peach

PEACH
(with a little girlish
shriek of joy)
MARIO

MARIO
I beat the game

Peach and Mario kiss join hands and look out over their
city indeed their world We pan up into the blue sky

CLOSE UP ON
DAISY’S EYES

INT DARK ROOM

Daisy’s eyes Ssloooocoowly open She’s in a dark room Daisy
springs out of bed and nearly trips on her dress Wait
dress Yes Daisy is now dressed in the amazingly beautiful
classic yellow “Daisy Gown” She stares at it breathing
hard and then looks around there’s nothing in the boat
cabin that indicates time of day or place and she rushes
over to the big balcony doors and shoves them open
revealingThe Field Of Broken Giants

She’s shoved the doors so hard that they go flying off there
hinges sail out over the dry cracked earth and crash to
the ground She’s on the top level of Funky’s Yacht She
stumbles through them out onto the deck where Chet Rippo and
Toad sit in pool chairs drinking fruity umbrella drinks
sunbathing

Chet seems better than we’ve ever seen him clean shaven
showered and looking nearly respectable Toad is still
healing from his burns but it’s clear all they’ve done is
add to his grizzled adventurer machismo

DAISY
What’sWhere

TOAD
Agh watch it with the doors there
honey We aren’t insured

CHET
(shouting up to someone
unseen)
Daisy’s up
(tilts his head to Daisy)
Hey Lieutenant

DAISY
(staring at Toad)
ChetWhat’s

Luigi drops down from the Captain’s Chair above Daisy and
takes her hand

LUIGI
That’s Sir Toad He’s a friend

DAISY
(still totally in shock)
LuigiI

Chet chuckles softly truly at peace for the first time in
his life Luigi leads Daisy up to the bow of the ship and
sweeps his arms presenting the hauntingly beautiful vista of
the Field Of Broken giants

He does a little spin this is not the gaunt miserable Luigi
of Cassavettes Real Estate He’s a whole new man and Daisy
knows it something about his happiness just makes her feel
safe

DAISY
LuigiWhere are we

LUIGI
(beaming)
We’re home Daisy

He’s right Just like the rest of them she belongs there

DAISY
(her knees buckling a
little)
LuigiIt’sit’sbeautiful

He takes her in his arms and they share a long awaited
passionate kiss All is as it is meant to be We spiral up
up into the clouds where something pink flits by Once
twice and then directly at us it’s Kirby He smiles and
then swallows us and everything goes black

THE END
