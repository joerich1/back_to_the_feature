FADE IN ON
EXT CANCUN HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

The hotel is six stories high a wall of glass and stucco
Beach chairs are arrayed around the pools edge sunbathers
lie sprawled across them A short boardwalk leads toward the
Gulf of Mexico the white sand the blue water

Four young Americans are encamped near the pools edge
theyre all in their early twenties AMY lies face down on a
chaise eyes shut a cooler beside her Shes petite with
short blond hair her skin pinkly sunburned

ERIC sits in the chair beside her studying the Cliff Notes
for The Canterbury Tales Hes leanly muscular with dark
curly hair Other Cliff Notes lie scattered beneath his
chair Antigone A Separate Peace Hea rt of Darkness 1984

JEFF and STACY sit on the far side of the cooler theyre
playing gin Stacy too is petite with short hair though
hers is dark Shes wearing a pale blue bikini and has a
beer bottle in her hand She looks a little bored

Jeff is tall scrawny Like Eric he has a pair of swim
trunks on and is deeply tanned Hes very focused frowning
down at his cards

STACY
We should play War Its more fun
Jeff takes a card from his hand lays it down on the table

JEFF
Thats not even a game

STACY
Sure it is Ill teach you
She starts-to fold her handbut Jeff shakes his head

JEFF
I know how to play I mean its
just chance--theres no skill
involved

Stacy frowns down at her hand silenced She picks a card
from the deck immediately discards it Jeff snatches it up
lays down one of his own Stacy stares at it in dismay

STACY
But I keep losing

JEFF
Cause youre not concentrating

STACY
I wouldnt have to concentrate if
we played War

JEFF
Exactly So wheres the fun

STACY
Id win sometimes Its not fun if
we both cant win

JEFF
But its not winning if its just
chance

STACY
Of course it is If we flipped a
coin and I called heads and it--

ERIC
Fuckthis shit

Eric throws the Canterbury Tales to the ground Then he

rises steps to the cooler pulls out a beer carries it
back

to his chair Stacy watches as he takes a long swallow

STACY
Maybe you should just be honest
sweetie

Eric doesnt even glance at her He sips his beer again

STACY (contd)

You could say look I dont know
anything about these either so now
were gonna read them together and
sort of teach each other as we go
(turning to Jeff)

Wouldnt you have loved that To
have a teacher who--

Amy speaks without opening her eyes cutting Stacy off

AMY
Why would they hire you if you
havent read the books

ERIC
I said I had

JEFF
So maybe you should

ERIC

(appalled by the idea)

The Canterbury Tales You ever
look at that shit

JEFF

ERIC

Fuck off Its not even English

Jeff watches Stacy take another card she examines it sets
it on the discard pile Then RECITING

JEFF
This world nys but a thurghfare ful
of wo and we been pilgrymes
passing to and fro Deeth is an
ende of every worldly soore

Eric and Stacy stare at Jeff in astonishment Amy doesnt
react Jeff glances toward her

JEFF (contd)
Sunscreen Amy

AMY

JEFF

Youre burning I can see it

She finally opens her eyes lifts her head peers at her
shoulders She presses at the pink skin

ANY

Stacy leans forward picks a second card off the deck Jeff
is focused on Amy he doesnt notice

JEFF
Youre hot because youre burning

AMY
Its only been--
Stacy interrupts speaking in a slightly SINGSONG fashion

STACY

So there was this king who lived
in a castle

Amy turns gives her a pained look

AMY
Please dont

ERIC
But what he really wanted was a
beach house

AMY
Stop it Both of you Right now
They ignore her ping-ponging quickly back and forth

STACY
So he decided to move

ERIC
But the Queen didnt want to

STACY
So he left by himself

ERIC

But he got lonely

Amy covers her ears with her hands blocking out their
voices but then inmiediately reaches to feel for her
earrings one of them is missing

AMY
Shit

STACY
So he bought a dog

ERIC
But it had fleas

AMY
I lost my earring

STACY
So he gave it a bath

ERIC
But the dog caught cold
Amy sits up glancing about Stacy and Eric keep going

STACY
So he gave it some medicine

ERIC
But it was the wrong kind
beach

Jeff

STACY

So the dog died

Amy rises steps toward the pool Jeff lays down his cards
joins her beside the water They both peer into it

EXT CANCUN HOTEL - BOARDWALK - DAY
A young man is approaching down the boardwalk from the

carrying fins a mask a snorkel Hes in his early
twenties blond crew-cut very tall His name is MATHIAS
As he nears the pool he stops staring

MATHIASS POV - THE POOL

Eric and Stacy have risen to join Jeff and Amy theyre all
peering into the water Amy holds her remaining earring out
to Eric and Stacy showing them what it looks like

BACK TO SCENE - MATHIAS
He stands there hesitating Then he starts forward

MATHIASS POV - THROUGH THE MASK - UNDERWATER - DAY
We glide just above the pools pale blue bottom A silver
earring comes into view Mathiass hand reaches for it

EXT CANCUN HOTEL - POOL - DAY

The two couples have spread out around the pools edge
searching for the earring Mathias surfaces in front of Amy
He holds out his hand with the earring-in it she stares
startled then crouches to take it

AMY
Thank you so much

-Mathias nods He starts to turn as if to swim off but

stops him

JEFF
Wait want a beer
He waves toward their chairs the cooler beside them
EXT CANCUN HOTEL - POOL - LATER

Mathias and the two couples sit together with their beers

Amys skin has turned deep red Stacy is behind her
applying

lotion to her shoulders Eric is talking to Mathias

ERIC

We went sailing yesterday Out

these seven foot fish these huge--

JEFF
Nurse sharks

ERIC

ERIC

The water was I dont know ten
feet deep And they were lying on
the bottom just waiting for
somebody to come swimming by--

JEFF
Theyre not dangerous
Eric turns stares at Jeff

ERIC
You said theyre sharks

JEFF

But theyre not dangerous They

eat lobsters Sea urchins That

sort of thing

Eric considers this frowning Then he takes a sip of beer
He shrugs turns back toward Mathias

ERIC

When Mathias speaks its with a SLIGHT GERMAN ACCENT

MATHIAS

Jeff glances around the pool

JEFF

Mathias shakes his head

MATHIAS

JEFF

MATHIAS
Its a complicated story
They watch him waiting for more but nothing comes

ERIC

You should hang with us then If

youre on your own

(he glances at the others)

Right

Everyone nods smiling Eric reaches into the cooler pulls
out another beer holds it toward Mathias

EXT CANCUN BEACH - NIGHT

Theres a DJ a dozen beer kegs A few young men and women
are dancing beside a bonfire but most of the crowd is
scattered in small groups across the sand TALKING

the firelight flickering off their faces
Stacy Amy Eric Jeff and Mathias are sitting together

all have cups of beer Stacy is between Erics legs leaning
against his chest Amy Jeff and Mathias sit cross-legged
Everyone but Jeff and Mathias is a little drunk and you can
hear it in their voices Amy drains her cup stands up very
unsteadily She holds out her hand to Jeff

AMY
Dance
Eric smiles as if the idea of Jeff dancing were

ERIC

Jeff doesnt dance Amy--he has no
rhythm Of all his many gifts
rhythm is not one

AMY

Thats not true He played the
trombone in high school He won a
prize

Eric seems startled by this amused

ERIC
Seriously

absurd

Amy nods She drains her beer tosses the cup aside

AMY

Jeffs won prizes for everything
His Mom has a whole room built just
for them Trophies and ribbons and
plaques Hes a very accomplished
young man

(she holds out her hand-to

ERIC)

Stacy makes a SNORTING sound

STACY
Or grass Or cement Or carpet

ERIC
I dance on teak

AMY
Teak
ERIC

Its a type of wood Very rare

Find me a teak floor and Ill be a

dancing fool

Amy shifts toward Mathias holds out her hand He stares at
it then glances at Jeff Before he can speak Stacy pushes
herself to her feet shes almost as wobbly as Amy

STACY
Ill dance

They lurch off across the sand toward the bonfire The boys
watch them go A beat then Jeff glances at his watch

JEFF
Im gonna head back
Eric gives him a look of disappointment

ERIC
Youre kidding
Jeff seems STARTLED by this

JEFF

Another nod Eric turns toward Mathias

JEFF
Gone to bed earlier
Eric stares at him this wasnt the direction he was

heading
JEFF (contd)
If Im gonna be so short on sleep
I should get asmuch as I can now
dont you think
He stands up brushes the sand from his shorts Eric shrugs
lifts his cup toward him
ERIC
All work and no play--

JEFF
Makes a man healthy wealthy and
wise
With that Jeff nods good night to them then starts off
toward the hotel Eric and Mathias turn back toward the
bonfire They sit in silence watching the girls dance
After a moment Amy staggers away from the other dancers
toward a group of young men drinking together in the
shadows She reaches down pulls one of them to his feet
starts to drag him back toward the bonfire
The young man is tall with long blond hair He LAUGHS
tries to free himself but Amy is insistent she keeps
pulling at him and finally he surrenders They begin to
dance Stacy is dancing on her own eyes shut oblivious
Mathias glances toward Eric Eric shrugs
ERIC
Amy drifts sometimes when she
drinks
MATHIAS
Drifts
ERIC
Like a boat--she bumps into other
boats
They continue to watch Amy and her partners dancing is
becoming steadily more intimate the gap between their
bodies

narrowing then disappearing altogether Finally Eric
blond-

jeans

pushes himself to his feet

ERIC (contd)

Come on Lets save everyone some

grief

He starts forward followed by Mathias They join Stacy and
Amy and Eric subtly interrupts Amys pas de deux The

haired young man disengages drifts back toward his friends
EXT CANCUN BEACH - DAWN

Its quiet the sun just breaking the horizon the beach is
nearly empty A handful of hotel employees are tidying up
after the bonfire carrying off the empty kegs raking clean
the rubbish-strewn sand Gulls hover overhead CAWING

Jeff appears running along the beach his T-shirt soaked
with sweat He stops as he nears us stands for a moment
just above the line of surf catching his breath watching
the sun rise Then he turns starts toward the hotel

EXT CANCUN HOTEL - TERRACE - DAWN

A breakfast buffet trays of pancakes eggs fresh fruit
There are a dozen tables beneath brightly colored umbrellas
Mathias is the only diner at this hour hes dressed in

Mathias lifts his head Jeff is standing there in his sweaty
shirt smiling down at him

look Theres a paragraph in German scrawled above a hand-
drawn map with four place names Cancun Valladolid

MATHIAS

The girl my brother met was on her
way to this place to work

(he waves at the map)

Its a dig--an archaeological dig
And he went with her He left the
map saying I could come too if I
got bored on my own

A beat he watches Jeff examine the map

MATHIAS (contd)

Our flight leaves the day after

him to do the right thing

Jeff frowns down at the map for a long beat It seems as if
hes going to question the feasibility of this but then he
disengages instead wiping at the sweat on his face

JEFF
Well good luck

Mathias nods his thanks and Jeff turns starts away from

table WE MOVE with him across the terrace into the
INT CANCUN HOTEL - RESTAURANT

The town is very small a dirt road lined with one- and two-
story buildings some with thatched roofs Theres a gravel
turnaround with a bus idling in it Its door CREAKS open

A dozen tourists emerge from the bus blinking in the
sunlight Jeff Amy Stacy Eric and Mathias are among
them The boys have the knapsacks the girls are wearing
matching hats Amy rubs at her face stretching waking up-
Theres a souvenir stand at the towns entrance with
brightly colored blankets hanging from its walls The
tourists start toward it leaving Jeff and the others

JEFF
Two and a half miles
BARRING

The tourists are vanishing into the town The buss door
SQUEAKS shut

ANY

I dont see any cabs

The bus eases into motion CRUNCHING across the gravel
pulling out onto the road Behind it a yellow pickup truck
is revealed TAXI is hand-painted in black on its side
They start toward the truck Its DRIVER is Mayan short and
heavy-set with thick glasses His eyes are shut hes
dozing behind the wheel The trucks engineis running the
windows shut tight against the heat

Jeff TAPS the window and theres a burst of movement from
the trucks rear as a dog springs up BARKING and GROWLING
They all leap back the girls SHRIEKING

The dog is a mutt--small but muscular Hes attached to a
cinder block by a short chain which he throws himself
against slobbering snapping at the air

They all stare at the dog the girls LAUGH nervously
clutching each other The driver has roused himself he
leans forward rolls down his window stares out at them

JEFF

Hola

The man gives him a somber nod the dog keeps BARKING Jeff
takes the map from Mathias then steps warily forward

JEFF (contd)

Habla ingles usted

The man half-nods half-shrugs

JEFF (contd)

How much to drive us to here

He offers the map to the driver who reaches to take it The
man frowns at it Then in HEAVILY ACCENTED ENGLISH

Jeff struggles for a simple way to explain their mission in
the back of the truck the dog continues its frantic

black along the gums Jeff pulls out his wallet He removes
a ten and a five then points at the map

JEFF

dollars to go here

He holds the money out The man doesnt even look at it

DRIVER

Jeff has somehow insulted him Jeff hesitates glancing
toward the others again Then in a CONCILIATORY TONE

JEFF

(he points toward Mathias)

Su hermano

The driver wrenches the door open making Jeff and the

flinch He climbs out still with that angry expression on
his face then leans into the back of the truck grabs the

dogs chain unhooks it from the cinder block

He lifts the dog from the truck by the chain Even dangling
by its neck the mutt continues to SNARL and snap at Jeff

the others They back away and the man tosses the dog into
the trucks cab pushing the door shut The dog throws its
body against the window slobbering and BARKING

The man turns toward Jeff wiping his hands on his pants
Jeff tries again

JEFF (contd)

The driver cuts him off holding out his hand with that

air of enraged disgust

DRIVER

El dinero

Jeff gives him the money Then the driver SLAPS the side of
the truck gestures for them to climb into the back

EXT YUCATAN ROAD - FROM HIGH ABOVE - DAY

Below us the yellow truck travels along a single-lane road
Jeff and the others are in its rear There are fields on
either side of the road bordered by thick jungle

The truck reaches a fork in the road bears left angling
toward the wall of jungle into which it vanishes the
overhanging foliage blocking it from sight

EXT YUCATAN ROAD - IN THE JUNGLE - DAY

The road is dirt heavily rutted Theres a small clearing
beside it with a path opening off it The trees grow over
ruts

rear

the path forming a shady tunnel WE HEAR birds calling a
steady throb of insect life but otherwise all is silent
A beat then theres the sound of the TRUCK approaching
along with the dogs BARKING and GROWLING The pickup
appears moving slowly bouncing and swaying across the

The truck pulls into the little clearing stops Jeff and
the others clamber out over its tailgate

The dog is still lunging at them from behind the trucks

window Jeff gives the driver a wave

JEFF

Gracias senor

The driver doesnt even look at him he just pulls out onto
the road heading back in the direction from which they

There are mosquitoes Stacy starts to slap at herself Jeff
unslings his pack pulls out a can of insect repellent
JEFF (contd)

Here

He begins to spray her then Eric Amy is peering off after
the truck They can still hear the dogs BARKING but very
faintly now Jeff finishes with Eric starts in on Mathias

AMY

How do we get back

She points back down the road toward the vanished truck
Jeff pauses in his spraying considers for a moment Then

JEFF
The guidebook said you can always
flag down a passing bus So I--

AMY

Jeff nods this seems obvious He resumes spraying Mathias
Eric and Stacy stand there watching

AMY (contd)

beat then shakes his head snaps it shut Jeff finishes
spraying Amy starts in on himself

JEFF
They must-have a way to get
supplies in

AMY

When we find Mathiass brother we

can just ask them to take us all

(turning to Mathias)

Right

Mathias seems startled by the question

MATHIAS

Mathias and Eric nod and the boys start down the path Amy
stands there watching them go Stacy steps toward her

STACY

Just go with it honey Youll

see--itll all work out

She hooks arms with her pulls her into motion

EXT JUNGLE TRAIL - MOVING - DAY

They hike in single file first Jeff then Eric Mathias
Stacy and Amy The path is six feet wide hard-packed dirt
All around and above is the jungle big-leafed plants vines
and creepers immense trees

The path moves in snakelike curves we cant see-very far in
either direction Theyre all sweating their shirts
clinging to their bodies The bugs continue to harass them

STACY

So-there was this girl who bought
a piano

Amy gives a loud MOAN

ERIC
But she didnt know how to play

STACY
So she signed up for lessons

ERIC
But she couldnt afford them
Stacy reaches taps Mathiass shoulder

STACY
You can play too If you want

Mathias glances back at her

STACY (contd)

Its easy Someone says So then
you say But Its like catch only
without a ball

(to Eric)

So she got a job in a factory

ERIC
But was fired for being late
Amy takes off her hat wipes the sweat from her face

AMY
Its annoying

STACY
So she became a prostitute
AMY

Its tedious and boring And once
they start its impossible to get
them to stop

ERIC

But she fell in love with her first

client

Amy puts her hat back on She looks hot sweaty tired

AMY

How much farther

Mathias peers down at his brothers note Stacy and Eric
continue with their game

MATHIAS STACY

off to our left If we see a

village weve gone too far

AMY (contd) ERIC

A village But he was already married

MATHIAS STACY

A Mayan village So she begged him to get a
divorce

AMY (contd) ERIC

conditioning wife

Mathias shrugs returns the note to his pocket

MATHIAS STACY

It just says theres a So she decided to kill her
village

AMY (contd)

I think we should go see it

STACY
Me too

AMY
I think we should---
Jeff stops suddenly pointing

JEFF

The stream

Thirty feet in front of them the trail dips toward a small
stream studded with boulders It resumes on the far bank

rising gradually uphill in a long straightaway The stream

is slow moving the water dark brown Eric SNIFFS the air

ERIC
Fucking smells

JEFF
They must use it as a latrine

ERIC
Who

JEFF

The village The Mayans

They start toward it gingerly the girls covering their
noses Jeff crosses the stream hopping from boulder to
boulder and the others follow Stacy almost falls in she
only catches her balance at the final instant YELPING
Jeff is already starting up the trail searching for the
turnoff Theres no sign of it the dense foliage extends
unbroken as far as the eye can see He turns to Mathias
JEFF (contd)

How far past the stream

MATHIAS
Right after it says

They stand there in a loose group staring at the trees
Eric pulls a bottle of water from his pack takes a swallow
then passes it to Stacy Amy lifts her arm points

AMY

Look

Up the trail sixty feet away stand two small Mayan boys
they seem to have materialized out of the air Theyre ten
years old shirtless scrawny dark-haired one of them is
holding a bicycle by its handlebars it doesnt have a seat
AMY (contd)
Maybe they can guide us
Stacy smiles toward the boys she waves CALLS OUT

STACY

HOLAL

The boys just stand there staring at them silent their
expressions wary even frightened One of them leans to
whisper something to the other who nods

ERIC
Why dont we--
He stops noticing Mathias The German is staring toward the
edge of the trail where a large bush sits one of its
fronds is very slowly dropping toward them pulling itself
free of the soil
Mathias steps forward tugs at a second frond which slips
easily from the dirt He tosses it aside reaches for
another frond this too slips free Someone has pushed
them into the earth arranging them to look like a bush
Mathias pulls a fourth frond free then a fifth and an
opening is revealed in the brush a narrow path winding its
way off through the trees They stand there a beat staring
at it Then theres a SQUEAKING SOUND and they all turn

AMYS POV - UP THE TRAIL

one of the boys is hurriedly pedaling off bent low over the
bicycles handlebars His companion remains behind staring
toward us with a look of obvious anxiety

BACK TO SCENE
Amy turns to Jeff so do the others

AMY
Why was it covered
Jeff lifts his hands how should he know

STACY

Maybe its not the right path

NO one speaks They keep staring from the boy to the newly
revealed path trying to make sense of it WE can still HEAR
the squeaking of the bicycle growing steadily fainter

JEFF
Its on the map

AMY
Its a hand-drawn map Jeff

STACY

And it was hidden Why would it be

hidden

Jeff steps forward shields his eyes tries to peer into the
dimness of the narrow path Then he glances back toward the
little boy who continues to stand there watching them

JEFF
Maybe the archaeologists dont want
people to find the mine

AMY
Because
Jeff has to think Finally

JEFF

Maybe theyve dug up something

valuable Emeralds or something

Or silver Whatever they were

mining in the first place And

they dont want anyone to come rob

them So theyve asked the Mayans

to help keep people away

He falls into silence staring at the boy No one appears
very convinced by his theory not even Jeff He shrugs
JEFF (contd)

How much farther is it

Mathias takes the map from his pocket again glances at it

MATHIAS
Not far

JEFF
Be silly to stop now dont you
think
No one answers no one moves

ANY
This just feels weird Jeff
Jeff SIGHS fighting to suppress his impatience with her

JEFF

So we what Turn around Walk all

the way back to Coba

Silence They all turn to stare back down the trail then
toward the Mayan boy whos still watching them Stacy SLAPS
a mosquito leaving a bloody smear on her bare arm Jeff
lifts his hand gestures at the pathleading into the trees
JEFF (contd)

Come on Were almost there

The others glance at one another waiting for someone to
argue no one does Finally Mathias steps forward slipping
through the narrow opening Eric follows him and then with
just the slightest hesitation so do Amy and Stacy

Jeff throws one last glance toward the boy--whos still
standing there sixty feet away watching with his anxious
expression--and then he too vanishes into the trees

EXT NARROW PATH - MOVING - DAY

They make their way along the winding path one after
another all of them sweating slapping at the mosquitoes

ERIC

Maybe the ruins are sacred You

know And they dont want people

digging them up

He glances about off into the trees a little spooked
ERIC (contd)

We could be walking through some

sort of ancient graveyard right

now And theyve--

JEFF
Its a mine An old mining camp
its

ERIC
So

JEFF

Theres nothing sacred about it

Eric considers this as they walk The others are also quiet
too hot to speak The sunlight falls through the trees in
thin shifting columns hazed with mosquitoes

ERIC

Maybe it leads to a marijuana
field then Maybe the village is
growing pot and that boy rode off
to get them and theyre gonna come
with guns and--

AMY
Eric

ERIC
What

AMY

Shut up okay

Eric falls silent They follow the path as it curves first
right then left moving gradually uphill all the while and
suddenly theres sunlight in front of them bright and
intense a clearing They hesitate at its edge staring

EXT CLEARINGBASE OF THE HILL - DAY

he clearing is twenty yards wide and extends in either
irection as far as the eye can see finally curving out of
ight Its soil is a deep black flecked with white like
rost rime Its completely free of vegetation

he path resumes on the far side of the clearing winding

Hues

ay up asmall hill The hill is rocky oddly treeless and
overed with a vinelike growth--a vivid green with hand-
haped leaves and tiny red flowers

eff and the others step warily out onto the cleared ground
eering about squinting in the sudden sunlight They stare
p at the flower-covered-hill

view

There are hints of ruins among the thick foliage giant
boulders with faint carvings etched onto their surfaces the
crumbling remains of a fallen pillar everything half-buried
beneath the vine

STACY
Its beautiful

AMY
So beautiful

STACY

And the mosquitoes are gone You

realize that Theyve stopped

biting

She smiles at the others delighted by this development Amy
removes the cap from her camera starts to take pictures

AMYS POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER

WE HEAR a click as she takes each photo and the image
freezes for an instant

Theres the hillside covered in its vine its red flowers
CLICK Theres Eric pulling the water bottle from his pack
CLICK Theres Stacy smiling at us waving CLICK Theres
Mathias shading his eyes peering up the hill

AMY (0S
Smile Mathias

MATHIAS
Is that a tent
He points

BACK TO SCENE
Amy lowers her camera turns to look

AMYS POV - UP THE HILL

An orange square of fabric is just visible at the very top
of the hill billowing sail-like in the breeze From this
distance with the rise of the hill partly blocking the

its hard to tell what it is

BACK TO SCENE

They all stand there peering up the hill Faintly but

growing steadily louder a THUDDING noise comes from the
jungle The five of them turn heads cocked listening

JEFF

A horse

Its true HOOFBEATS are approaching at a gallop
Instinctively Jeff and the others back a handful of steps
toward the hill A long beat then a horseman bursts into
the clearing rearing to a halt Amy lifts her camera

AMYS POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER

A bald Mayan man is on the horse hes broad-shouldered
short in his early forties dressed in a white shirt and
pants The horse rears a second time and the image FREEZES
for an instant with a CLICK as Amy snaps another picture

BACK TO SCENE

The bald man SHOUTS at them in UNSUBTITLED MAYAN His horse
is lathered SNORTING rolling its eyes It rears yet again
and the man half-falls half-jumps to-the ground Jeff and
the others back a few more steps into the clearing

AMYS POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
The bald man is still holding the reins the horse is

backing
away from him jerking its head trying to break free
pulling him step-by-step back toward the trail CLICK
BACK TO SCENE
The man cant gain control of the horse Finally he drops
the reins and the horse gallops into the jungle CRASHING
through the trees its hoofbeats gradually diminishing
The man turns toward them starts YELLING in MAYAN again
pointing back down the trail Sweat shines on his forehead
Theres a gun on his belt a black pistol in a brown
holster

Stacy is clutching Erics arm looking frightened

STACY
Whats he saying
billowing

the

quivers

ERIC

Maybe he wants money A toll or

something

The Mayan continues SHOUTING waving his arm Jeff reaches
into his pocket pulls out his wallet removes a twenty

JEFF

Dinero

The man ignores the proffered bill makes a shooing motion
waving them from the clearing Mathias turns toward the
hill cups his hands around his mouth SHOUTS

MATHIAS

HENRICHI
Theres no response just the orange fabric gently

JEFF

Why dont you hike up see if you

can find him Well try to sort

this out

Mathias nods starts across the clearing The bald man
SHOUTS at him in Mayan and then when Mathias doesnt stop
pulls his pistol from its holster FIRES into the sky
Everyone flinches half-ducking Stacy SCREAMS Mathias

goes still The man waves at him YELLING in Mayan and
Mathias comes back his hands raised to join the others
HOOFBEATS are approaching from the jungle again They come
closer and closer and suddenly two more horsemen burst into
the clearing Theyre younger than the bald mans in their
twenties dark-haired muscular One has a mustache

Their mounts are white-eyed SNORTING rearing just like

bald mans The two men jump to the ground dropping their
reins and the horses immediately turn and gallop back into
the jungle Amy lifts her camera again

AMYS POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
The young men have bows slung across their chest and

of thin fragile-looking arrows They question the bald man
in MAYAN very rapidly Hes still aiming his pistol at
Mathias A CLICK and the image freezes for an instant
steps

through

BACK TO SCENE

As they continue to interrogate the bald man in MAYAN the
young men unsling their bows each of them nocking an arrow
Reflexively Jeff and the others retreat another handful of
steps into the clearing Mathias still has his hands raised

ERIC
What the fuck

JEFF
Quiet

ERIC
THEY RE--

JEFF

Wait Wait and see

Amy is a bit farther into the clearing than Jeff and the
others She keeps swinging her camera from them to the
Mayans trying to capture the whole scene in one shot Shes
too close though-and she retreats another handful of

AMYS POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER

Still backing up toward the hill all of them but Stacy and
Eric are in the frame now The bald Mayan is still answering
the young mens questions He turns toward us suddenly
points his pistol directly at usstarts to SHOUT

BACK TO SCENE
Jeff and the others turn too staring at Amy in surprise
Shes nearly at the far edge of the clearing peering

her camera she retreats another step The young Mayans
raise their bows drawing them the bald man keeps YELLING

JEFF

AMY--
She takes another step shes right up against the vines

AMYS POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER

Stacy is in the frame now We retreat one more step and so
is Eric and the Mayans with their raised weapons the bald
man still SHOUTING everything FREEZES on the CLICK
Mayans

BACK TO SCENE

Amy lowers her camera The Mayan with the mustache turns to
the other two points toward her feet SPEARING URGENTLY
The bald Mayan slowly lowers his pistol looking dismayed
Amy glances down

AMYS POV - HER FEET
Shes stepped out of the clearing into the flowering vine

BACK TO SCENE

Both of the younger Mayans are speaking now their voices
RISING The bald Mayan is shaking his head protesting but
they talk right over him Amy steps clear of the vine
starts back toward Jeff and the younger Mayans draw their
bows taut again aiming at her chest She freezes

AMY

JEFF---
Jeff lifts his hand without looking his eyes on the

JEFF

Dont move

The bald man continues to frown and shake his head He
points to Amy then the others he waves toward the jungle
But the young men are implacable--they keep arguing
gesturing--and finally the bald man gives in falls SILENT
A beat then the bald man raises his pistol aims it at
Jeffs chest He makes a shooing motion with his other hand
but now its toward Amy and the hill beyond her

He begins to SHOUT the other men do too Then the bald man
FIRES a bullet into the dirt at Jeffs feet Everyone jumps
starts to retreat The men with the bows are swinging them
back and forth herding them toward the hill

When Jeff and the others reach Amy the bald man points
toward the trail waves them up it He watches--—his
expression looking stricken close to tears--as the five of
them obediently begin to climb the vine-covered hill

EXT HILLSIDE - DAY
Midway up the hill they pause to catch their breath

JEFF
Check your phone Eric
Eric pulls out his phone flips it open stares at it

ERIC

Nothing

He snaps it shut They stand there sweating scared
looking Mathias cups his hands to his mouth again SHOUTS

MATHIAS
HenrichI
They all peer up the hill waiting for a response

ERICS POV -- UP THE HILL

It is a tent bright orange looking a bit worse for wear

The vine is growing up its aluminum poles as if ona
trellis

-The tent faces away from us its doorway is hidden Theres

no sign or sound of any people

BACK TO SCENE
Eric turns glances back down the hill shielding his eyes

ERIC
Theres another one
He points toward the clearing below them

ERICS POV THE CLEARING

A fourth man has arrived on a bicycle Hes dressed in
white like the others with a straw hat on his head A
beat then two more Mayans appear also on bicycles They
all have bows slung over their shoulders

The bald man addresses these newcomers He waves in either
direction and the other men start off along the clearing
two one way three the other leaving him alone at the base
of the hill

A beat then a little boy appears from the jungle--the one
whod watched them discover the camouflaged path He and the
bald man stand there peering up at us
waist-

things

BACK TO SCENE
Eric turns to the others EXCITED

ERIC

Lets run back down Quick While
theres just him and the kid We
can rush them

STACY

Hes got a gun Eric

This silences Eric--silences all of them Mathias turns
SHOUTS toward the tent again

MATHIAS

Henrich1

Theres no answer They wait another beat then Jeff waves
them back into motion

EXT HILLTOP - DAY

The hill is flat on top forming a wide plateau Beyond the
orange tent is a small clearing of rocky ground A blue tent
sits on the far side of the clearing looking just as
weathered as the orange one the vine growing up its poles
The five of them pause peering about Jeff CALLS OUT

JEFF

Hello

SILENCE The vine covers everything but the trail and the
clearing We glimpse more rubble beneath its greenery time-
worn stelae a low stone wall

In some places the vine folds back upon itself forming

high mounds tangled knoll-like profusions of green And
everywhere hanging off it are those bright red flowers
Mathias moves toward the orange tent and Jeff follows him
They UNZIP its flap stoop to peer inside

JEFFS POV - INSIDE-THE ORANGE TENT
The vine has taken root in here too growing on some
leaving others untouched There are three sleeping bags
unrolled on the floor An oil lamp Two backpacks A roll
of duct tape A bottle of tequila A metal canteen

BACK TO SCENE
Jeff and Mathias ZIP the flap back shut Eric Stacy and Amy
are fifteen feet away watching

ERIC
Whats inside

JEFF

Nothing Some camping supplies

Mathias starts across the clearing toward the blue tent
followed by Jeff and the others He UNZIPS its flap sticks
his head inside Jeff leans to look too

JEFFS POV - INSIDE THE BLUE TENT
The same thing sleeping bags backpacks camping supplies
The vine is growing on some things but not onothers

BACK TO SCENE

Ten yards beyond the tent theres a hole cut into the dirt

Stacy Amy and Eric have gathered at its edge Jeff and

Mathias join them The hole is rectangular--ten feet by six

feet--and very deep we cant see its bottom

A windlass has been constructed beside the hole a
horizontal

barrel with a hand crank welded to its base Rope is coiled

around the barrel From there it passes over a small wheel

which hangs from a sawhorse straddling the holes mouth

Then it drops straight into the earth

AMY

The mine

Jeff nods A draft is rising from the hole and it lifts off
Amys hat She tries to catch it but fumbles the hat

falls away from her They all watch it vanish into the dark
Eric pulls out his phone flips it open almost
absentmindedly a nervous gesture Theres still no signal
He closes it turns to survey the clearing the empty tents
barren

away

ERIC

Now what

Jeff shrugs waves past the shaft The clearing ends just a
few yards from them

then the vines resume and in the midst of the vines is the
path It winds its way to the edge of the hilltop vanishes
over it

JEFF

Keep going I guess

Saying this he slings his pack onto his shoulder Then he
starts forward the others falling in behind him

EXT HILLSIDE - DAY

They pick their way down the trail Its much steeper on
this side there are short stretches where they have to drop
onto their rear ends and slide one after another Its
after one of these that Jeff suddenly stops staring

JEFFS POV - THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL
It looks as if the jungle has been chopped down all the way
around the base of the hill isolating it in a ring of

soil One of the Mayans has made his way along this cleared
ground to the base of the trail Hes staring up at them

ERIC (0S)
Fuck
The man slides his bow off his shoulder nocks an arrow He
shakes his head at them CALLS OUT in MAYAN waves them

BACK TO SCENE
The five of them stand there staring down at the man

STACY
What do we do
Jeff shrugs starts forward again

JEFF
Well see
The others hesitate and then one after another resume
their downward march

EXT BASE OF THE HILL - DAY

As they approach the clearing the Mayan man YELLS what
sounds like someones name

A beat then another bowman comes jogging into view Jeff
and the others stop at the bottom of the trail They stand
there staring

The vine has invaded the clearing here Ten feet in front of
the path is one of those odd knoll-like growths knee-high
thick with flowers The two Mayans are another twenty feet
beyond it in the center of the clearing bows drawn

AMY

So

Her skin is slick with sweat and shes winded from the hike
down A third Mayan comes jogging toward them He stops
beside the other two draws his bow

ERIC
We should rush them All at once

STACY
Shut Up Eric

ERIC

Or go make shields If we had some

shields we could--

He falls silent as another Mayan comes running toward them
along the clearing This one is bearded heavier than the
others And hes carrying a rifle

ANY

Oh my god

Jeff is staring at the little isolated island of vines ten
feet in front of them--peering intently at it

STACY
Lets go back up
Jeff takes a step forward into the clearing--slowly warily
on

shining

cheekbone

are

STACY (contd)
I wanna go back
Jeff takes another step edging toward the mound his eyes

the Mayans their raised weapons They just watch him
ANY

JEFF-—-

He ignores her takes a third step then a forth which
brings him to the mound of vines He crouches reaches into
the tendrils parting them He grasps a stalk tugs pulls
it free WE SEE a tennis shoe a sock a mans shin

Jeff turns stares at Mathias who steps forward crouches
beside him starts to pull at the vines gently at first
then more aggressively tearing them the plants sap

on his skin a low MOAN rising from his chest

Another shoe is revealed another leg a pair of jeans a
belt buckle a black T-shirt And then finally a young
mans face the flesh oddly eaten away so that his

is visible the white socket of his left eye

AMY (contd)

Oh no Oh Jesus

Jeff holds up his hand silencing her The Mayans stand
there in the center of the clearing watching Mathias has
begun to rock slightly that MOANING coming and going Jeff
touches his shoulder WHISPERS

JEFF

Easy All right Easy and slow

Well stand up and well walk away

Well walk back up the hill

The young mans T-shirt is stiff with dried blood There

three slender arrows impaled in his chest

MATHIAS
Its my brother

JEFF
squeezes

I know

MATHIAS
They killed him
Jeff nods his hand still on Mathiassshoulder he

JEFF

Shh Not here Up the hill okay

Mathias is struggling to control his breathing the MOANS
keep coming Finally he manages a nod and they both stand
up Stacy and Amy are holding hands looking stricken
Stacy has started to CRY Eric has his arm around her

The Mayans keep their weapons raised They watch in silence
as Jeff and the others turn to start back up the hill

EXT HILLTOP - DAY

Jeff and Mathias are at the top of the trail staring down
toward the clearing

JEFFS POV - THE BOTTOM OF THE BILL

More Mayans are appearing from the jungle Theyre all
armed The bald man sends them out along the clearing some
in one direction some the other

BACK TO SCENE

Jeff and Mathias stand there grim-faced watching Mathias
lifts his hands stares at them Theyve turned a deep raw-
meat red as if scarred He flexes his fingers wincing

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Amy Stacy and Eric sit in the clearing beside the shaft
passing a bottle of water among themselves Eric is
struggling to calm the girls

ERIC

We can sneak past once the sun-
sets I bet You know Just reep
by them in the dark

Stacy and Amy hardly seem to hear him they look dazed
again

distraught Eric passes the bottle to Stacy A beat then
ERIC (contd)
And then theres the girl

AMY
The girl

ERIC

The one his brother met What

happened to her

Amy and Stacy are silent Stacy lifts the water bottle to
her lips but immediately lowers it and starts to CRY

Amy takes her hand Eric watches them silent Then

ERIC (contd)

And the archaeologists You think--

Stacys crying deepens toward a SOB Amy gives Eric a look

AMY
Stop it Eric

ERIC
What

AMY

Just stop okay Stop talking

Stacy struggles to collect herself breathing deep She
wipes at her face Amy keeps stroking her hand

Jeff and Mathias are approaching across the hilltop Mathias
holding his burned-looking hands out in front of him He

9 a nd Jeff crouch beside the others

ERIC

What happened

Jeff takes the bottle from Stacy He pours a tiny bit of
water on Mathiass hands

JEFF

Theres something in the plants

The sap--it burned his skin

Mathias rubs at his hands with his shirt grimacing Amy
reaches to take the water back from Jeff She starts to lift
the bottle to her mouth butTeff leans forward grabs
JEFF (contd)
Dont We need to save it

AMY
But Im thirsty

JEFF
We all are

AMY
So lets drink
Jeff shakes his head capping the bottle

JEFF

We dont have that much We need

to ration it

(he glances up at the sky)

Well have to figure out a way to

catch the rain

Everyone but Amy peers up at the sky its a perfect
cloudless blue Amy remains focused on Jeff

AMY
Im hungover Im sunburned I
lost my hat I need some water

JEFF
AMY--

AMY
Why do you get to decide
Jeff stares at her considering this Then he shrugs

JEFF

Fine Lets vote

(he glances at the others)

But first you should understand
that each of us is gonna need half
a gallon of water a day ata
minimum to survive here Thats

it
two and a half gallons total every

day And right now until it

rains we dont have it Okay

Not even one days worth

(a beat)

Now who wants to give Amy more

water

A long moment of silence No one can meet Amys eyes
Finally VERY QUIETLY

STACY
Maybe we should just wait honey

ANY
Till
Everyone looks toward Jeff

JEFF

Another hour or so Then well all

have a sip Okay

Amy can see that she has no choice She gives a grudging
nod and Jeff slides the bottle into his knapsack
JEFF (contd)

We have to get organized Now

While were still fresh Well

have to stay out of the sun spend

as much time as possible in the

tents Well have to--

STACY
Cant we sneak away when it gets
dark Eric said we--

Jeff shakes his head cutting her off He waves across the
hilltop toward where he and Mathias had been standing

JEFF

They keep coming More and more of

them Theyre all armed and the

bald one sends them out along the

clearing Theyre surrounding us

Amy Stacy and Eric struggle to absorb this Finally
ERIC
Why dont they just kill us

JEFF

Its got something to do with the
hill I think Once you step on

it youre not allowed off
Something like that They wont
step on it themselves but now that
were here they wont let us
leave So we have to figure out a
way to survive till someone comes
and finds-us

AMY
Who
Jeff lifts one hand palm-up half a shrug

JEFF
Peoplell start to worry when we
dont return home Right And

THEY LL--

AMY

Were not supposed to leave till
Friday

Jeff nods

AMY (contd)

And theyll have to come searching
Again he nods

AMY (contd)

So youre talking--what a week

JEFF
Something like that
Amy looks appalled her voice JUMPS

AMY
We cant live here for a week
Jeff
JEFF

If we try to leave theyll shoot

us Thats the one thing we know

for certain

An electronic CHIRPING comes from the shaft it sounds like
a cell phone ringing Mathias turns his head listening No
one else notices it

AMY

But what will we eat How will we--

The RINGING comes again silencing her She glances toward
the shaft not quite believing what shes hearing It comes
a THIRD TIME and they all stand up step to the hole peer
into its darkness The RINGING comes yet again

STACY
A cell phone

AMY
It cant be--

JEFF
Thats a cell phone Amy
Definitely

AMY

But theres no signal out here

Eric cant get a signal

Reflexively Eric pulls out his phone checks again
nothing Theres another RING

JEFF
It could be a different network
Something local

AMY

Way down in that hole How could
it pick it up

Still another RING

ERIC
What else can it be

against

The RINGING falls SILENT They all stand there staring into
the hole A long beat then it RESUMES Eric CLAPS his
hands ecstatic The others are starting to smile too
Mathias moves to the windlass He unrolls some of the rope
starts to wrap it around his chest Jeff watches him
Another RING

The vine has taken root on the windlass- the sawhorse the
barrel the rope Jeff steps forward begins to yank it off
careful not to get the sap on his hands He turns to Amy

JEFF

Theres a lamp in the orange tent

See if you can find some matches

too

Amy hurries off toward the orange tent vanishing inside
Theres a final RING and then SILENCE again Mathias is
knotting the rope tightly around his chest

Amy returns carrying an oil lamp a box of matches
Everyone watches as Jeff crouches to light the lamp Then he
rises turns toward Mathias looks at him closely

JEFF (contd)

You sure

Mathias nods takes the lamp steps to the edge of the hole
Jeff and Eric move to the windlass they position themselves
at the hand crank leaning into it so the rope goes taut
Mathias girds himself steps out over the hole He dangles
there for a moment hanging beneath the sawhorse the
windlass GROANING on its mount Then Jeff and Eric begin to
reverse the crank letting the rope slowly spool out

Stacy and Amy stand beside the shaft peering into it
watching as Mathias begins his descent--ten feet twenty
feet thirty feet down and still only darkness beneath him
with no sign of the shafts bottom

The windlass CREAKS as it turns Jeff and Eric strain

it sweating muscles taut Amy has turned from the shaft
is watching the rope as it slowly unspools from the barrel

AMY

Jeff

He turns to look and she points at the rope where it comes
off the windlass and angles up toward the little wheel
hanging from the sawhorse

AMY (contd)

The sap

Theyd cleared off most of the vine from the rope but not
all of it Some of these remaining tendrils have been
crushed as the windlass slowly unspools Their sap is
darkening the rope in spots eating into it

AMY (contd)

I think its--

Jeff immediately turns back to the crank his voice URGENT

JEFF

Pull him up

Eric hasnt grasped whats happening He hesitates
JEFF (contd)

NOWT

Amy jumps forward to help all three of them pushing at the
crank getting in each others way the windlass CREAKING as
it begins to turn again slowly reclaiming the rope Stacy
remains beside the shaft peering anxiously into it

STACYS POV - THE SHAFT

Mathias is twenty-five feet beneath us just beginning to
bump his way upward swaying back and forth He stares up at
us CONFUSED

MATHIAS

What is it

The rope beneath the sawhorse is being visibly eaten away
its hemp unraveling

BACK TO SCENE
Stacy turns toward the others pointing terrified

STACY

ITs--

The rope SWAPS Jeff Eric and Amy fall forward the
windlass spinning wildly behind them freeof its weight A
long beat then theres a distant hollow-sounding THUMP
followed instantly by the POP of the lamp shattering

Stacy leans to peer into the shaft her hand over her mouth

STACYS POV - THE SHAFT
Darkness Silence

STACY (0S)
Mathias
Her voice ECHOES back at us Theres no response

BACK TO SCENE
Jeff Eric and Amy join Stacy at the edge of the shaft all
of them staring down into the darkness looking horrified

ERIC
Oh Jesus Oh fuck

AMY
Is he--
Theres a GROAN from below very faint almost inaudible

JEFF

Hes moaning

They listen for a beat but theres only silence

JEFF (contd)

I heard him moan

The others dont seem so certain Jeff turns to the girls
JEFF (contd)

One of you will have to go

AMY
Go
Jeff nods waving into the shaft

JEFF
Down Well clear the vine off the
rope And you can--

AMY
Why cant you Or Eric

JEFF
We have to work the crank You
wont be strong enough
REVEAL

Amy and Stacy stare at each other its obvious neither of
them wants to go Stacy is the one who finally gives in

STACY
I can do it

AMY

(RELIEVED)

You sure

Stacy nods but she doesnt look sure Shes hugging
herself it seems as if she might start trembling Before
anyone can speak that GROANING comes from the shaft again
louder this time unmistakable Jeff cups his hands SHOUTS

JEFF

Mathias

More SILENCE Jeff turns to the girls

JEFF (contd)

See if you can find a knife And

another lamp

He waves them toward the tents then he and Eric begin to
unspool the rope from the windlass laying it out across the
clearing in long looping circles

EXT CLEARINGBASE OF THE HILL - DAY

The Mayans keep coming women now too bearing bundles on
their backs Theyre setting up a campsite along the edge of
the jungle The bald man stands in their midst his hands on
his hips staring silently up the hillside

CU - OIL LAMP
The SCRATCH of a match being lit Amys hand comes into
frame lifts the lamps glass chimney fires the wick

JEFF (0S)

Just help him into the sling Then

well pull him up

The chimney is carefully replaced as WE PULL BACK TO

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Amy is crouched adjusting the lamps flame Jeff and Eric
have mended the rope

WE SEE the excised lengths of spoiled hemp and the ragged-
looking knots on the rope itself which has been spooled

once
more around the windlass
Theyve fashioned a sling at the ropes end Jeff and Eric
are helping Stacy into it pulling it over her head
adjusting it under her armpits
JEFF
Once we get him out well drop the
rope back down and pull you up
too
Amy offers Stacy the lamp Stacy is scared yet struggling
not to show it Her hands are trembling and the lamp
rattles as she takes it The boys are stepping toward the
windlass Eric stops glances back at her
ERIC
You okay
Stacy nods but without much conviction Eric steps toward
her gives her a tight hug He holds her eyes for a moment
kisses her Then he joins Jeff at the hand crank They lean
against it and the rope goes taut
Stacy steps out into the open air over the shaft the lamp
in

her right hand With her left hand she lunges grabs at the
sawhorse clings tightly to it Jeff glances toward her from
the hand crank

JEFF

Ready

She nods but doesnt relinquish her grip on the sawhorse
JEFF (contd)

You have to let go Stacy

For a moment it doesnt seem like shell be able to but
then--with a visible act of will--she does and they slowly
begin to let the rope out dropping her into the shaft

ON STACY - IN THE SLING

She grips the sling with one hand the lamp with the other
Wooden supports have been hammered into the walls of the
shaft buttressing the dirt The vine clings to them its
leaves and flowers paler than on the hillside above

Stacy begins to swing pendulum-like as she descends She
tries unsuccessfully to steady herself then glances up

He starts toward the windlass again

ON STACY - IN THE SLING

The rope jerks and she begins to rise She kicks her legs

lifts her left arm over head wrenches it free of the sling
so that only her right arm remains hooked She switches the

lamp from her right hand to her left then slips completely
free ofthe sling the lamp fluttering out as she drops

THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
Almost totally dark just a faint fall of light from above
flailing

peering

Mathias is a dim shape on the floor of the shaft Stacy
lands beside him--heavily awkwardly--the glass from his
shattered lamp CRUNCHING beneath her

She loses her balance pitches forward onto his body
MATHIAS makes a terrible SHRIEKING sound pure pain

his arms Stacy struggles to right herself

STACY

Im sorry Oh God Im so sorry

She pulls herself into a crouch staring down at him through
the dimness his SHRIEK fading to a steady MOANING

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING
Jeff Amy and Eric have rushed to the shaft theyre
into it Theres only darkness beneath them Eric SHOUTS

ERIC
Stacy
Stacys voice rises toward them sounding very FAR AWAY

STACY (0S)
I didnt want him to be alone

JEFF
What happened to the lamp

STACY (0S)

It blew out

Jeff turns from the shaft picks up the box of matches He
yanks off his shirt ties the box inside it then steps back
to the edge of the hole He CALLS down to Stacy

JEFF
Im dropping the matches Okay

STACY (0S)
Okay

Jeff holds the knotted bundle over the shaft lets it go It
falls into the darkness A long beat and then very softly

light

up

WE HEAR the thump as it lands

STACY (OS) (contd)

Got it

The three of them stare into the hole waiting for the

THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

Theres the RASP of a match its flickering flame then the
stronger illumination of the lamp as Stacy lights its wick
Mathias lies on his back before her silent now motionless
his eyes shut Stacy bends toward him WHISPERS

STACY

Mathias

He doesnt respond its hard to tell if hes conscious
Stacy lifts the lamp peers about the shaft The vine has
taken root even at this depth its flowers and leaves pale

the point of translucence

Beyond Mathias theres an opening in the dirt wall another
shaft cutting perpendicularly into the earth Its roof is
supported by a stone archway intricately carved Stacy
rises as if to investigate but then winces nearly falls
She peers down at her right leg A large piece of glass is
imbedded there just beneath her knee its the size of a
playing card gently concave dark with her blood She
reaches and grimacing pulls it from her body

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING
Jeff is at the windlass hurriedly cranking the rope back
Eric and Amy stand watching

JEFF

We need fifteen feet Twenty to be

safe

No one speaks The windlass turns with that steady CREAKING
but its higher-pitched now with no weight on the rope
JEFF (contd)

Come on Think How can we--
her

ERIC
The clothes From the backpacks
We could knot them together

JEFF

Would they hold

Eric frowns uncertain Jeff finishes with the rope stands
there catching his breath Stacysvoice rises toward them
from the shaft

STACY (0S)

I cut my knee

Eric hurries to the shaft followed by Jeff and Amy They
peer over its edge toward Stacy so far beneath them in

flickering circle of lamp light

ERIC
Bad

STACY
My shoes full of blood

JEFF
Put pressure on it Use my shirt
They all stare down at her waiting

TOE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

Stacy is crouched beside Mathias pressing Jeffs T-shirt to
her wound Her khakis and tennis shoe are dark with blood
theres a lot of it She isnt watching Mathias he startles
her when he opens his eyes and speaks

MATHIAS

Mylegs

His voice is faint and RASPY we can hear his pain in it
Stacy leans toward him tries to smile reassuringly

STACY
Hey

MATHIAS
Cant move mylegs

Stacy turns to look his legs are lying at an odd angle as
if he were a doll that had been carelessly tossed there
EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING

Jeff Eric and Amy still watching Jeff turns to the

others

JEFF

What about the tents We could

take one down cut the nylon into

strips

Eric and Amy glance toward the tents debating

ERIC

Would it be strong enough

JEFF

we can braid them--three strips for

each section Then knot the

sections together for strength

Before either of them can respond Stacys voice emerges
from

the shaft sounding SCARED

STACY (0S)
I think he broke his back
They fall silent staring down at her

STACY (OS) (contd)

He cant move his legs And it
smells

JEFF

Smells

STACY (0S)
Like he lost his bowels His
bladder

AMY
(very quietly)
Oh no Please no
Jeff turns to her

JEFF
How can we make a backboard
Amy starts to shake her head looking horrified

AMY
No Jeff No way We cant move

JEFF

One of the frames from the

backpacks And the tent poles

Theres tape in the orange tent

He doesnt wait for a response he leans over the shaft

SHOUTS

JEFF (contd)

We have to builda backboard
Stacy It might take a while

Theres a long hesitation as if Stacy is searching for some
alternative Then still sounding FRIGHTENED and FARAWAY

STACY (0S)
Okay
Amy is shaking her head growing FRANTIC

AMY

Well make it worse Well jostle
him and hell--
Jeff turns toward her with a hint of EXASPERATION

JEFF

We cant just leave him down there

You know that dont you

She starts to back away toward the edge of the clearing

AMY
we have to tell them

JEFF
Who

AMY

The Mayans We have to tell them

Jeff gives her an incredulous look She keeps retreating
shes almost at the path

AMY (contd)

They can send for help

JEFF
Theyre not gonna---

AMY

We have to may We have to--

She spins starts off at a run vanishing down the trail
Jeff calls after her SHOUTING

JEFF

Amy

But shes gone Jeff turns to Eric
JEFF (contd)

Stay here

And then he too is running

EXT CLEARINGBASE OF THE HILL - DAY

The Mayans have established their campsite on the edge of

the
jungle Two women are beside a campfire plucking a pair of
chickens WE SEE other campsites in the distance other
campfires hugging the jungles margin surrounding the
hill

Three men sit in the center of the clearing facing the
hillside their bows in their laps They rise suddenly
peering up the trail The women pause in their labor also
staring The campsite goes QUIET

THE MAYANS POV - UP THE HILL
Amy is sprinting toward us down the trail Jeff is ten yards
behind her also running
BACK TO SCENE

The three Mayans nock arrows Two other men step forward to
join them One has a bow the other is the bald Mayan with
the pistol He unholsters it and--as Amy reaches the bottom
of the trail--raises it aiming at her chest

Amy stops just short of the clearing sweating breathless
scared-looking She lifts her hands palms-up beseeching

AMY
Help us Please Someones been
hurt He--

Jeff comes to a halt five feet behind her

JEFF
They cant understand you
She turns her voice quickened with PANIC

AMY
Say it in Spanish Tell them he--

JEFF
They dont speak Spanish

AMY
Try it You have to try

She spins back toward the Mayans takes a step into the
clearing The bald man SHOUTS at her a single short
sentence in MAYAN Amy holds out her hands to him

AMY (contd)

Espanol Habla Espanol
Jeff steps forward grabs her elbow

JEFF
They killed Henrich Why would-

Amy tries to tug free but he wont let her She starts to
SHOUT at the Mayans

AMY

Help usi We need help

The Mayans just stare at her their weapons raised their
faces expressionless one of them is much younger than the
others almost a boy He says something in MAYAN to the bald
man and the bald man shakes his head
Amy begins to CRY Jeff pulls at her elbow

JEFF
We have to get back
Amy turns toward him her face smeared with tears

AMY

I didnt want to come I told you

Jeff tightens his grip on her arm gives her a little shake
as if to wake her up

JEFF
Listen to me Mathias needs our
help Right now He--

AMY

We shouldnt even be here Why did

you say wed come

(she wipes at her tears)

You have to do something

(rising toward a shout)

You have to Its your fault

Its all your--

Jeff shakes her again more roughly his voice like a slap

JEFF

YD-q stepped onto the hill

Amy stares at him startled into silence

JEFF (contd)

They wouldnt have forced us up it

if you hadnt

He holds her eyes making sure she understands Then
JEFF (contd)

Now lets go okay

He starts to pull her back toward the trail She allows
herself to be led shes begun to CRY again

AMY
I didnt know I just--
Shes growing increasingly upset almost SOBBING She tries
her

hanging

forward

to turn back toward the Mayans again but Jeff wont let

AMY (contd)
They have to help us

JEFF
Theyre not going to

AMY

They have to

She wrenches herself free stumbles falls into the vines
beside the trail Jeff reaches for her but she kicks away
from him grabbing at the vines scrambling to her feet
As she rises she yanks up a tendril a clot of earth

from its roots She SCREAMS spinning toward the clearing---
AMY (contd)

WHY WONT YOU FUCKING HELP US

--and throws the tendril at the Mayans They scramble
backward with surprising panic SHOUTING The youngest of
them is too slow the length of vine hits him in the leg

He stares down at the tendril in shock

The others back hurriedly away from him Two of them
continue to point their weapons at Amy but the bald man and
one of the other bowmen are aiming at the young Mayan now
Theres SHOUTING from the tree line The entire campsite is
on its feet a woman begins to SCREAM

Shes in herforties short and stout and she starts

into the clearing arms stretched toward the young Mayan
Two of the other women grab her hold her back

The bald Mayan starts to ADDRESS the young man pointing up
the hillside The short woman keeps SCREAMING flailing
trying to break free The young Mayan looks at her then at
the bald man He speaks in MAYAN a brief burst of words
The bald man shakes his head points up the hill again his
pistol aimed at the young mans chest The short woman is
WAILING eyes shut The young Mayan takes a step toward her
CALLING what seems to be her name
The bald man SHOUTS at him but the young Mayan ignores him
takes a second step then a third The bowmen are all aiming

steady

nylon

at him now and suddenly everyone seems to be YELLING
The young Mayan takes a fifth step holding out his arms
toward the WAILING woman CALLING to her The bald man
FIRES shooting him in the head At the same instant the
bowmen let their arrows fly the shafts THUMPING into the
young mans chest burying themselves to the fletches
The clearing goes still the only sound is the womans

WAILING Then the bald man swings his pistol toward Amy and
Jeffs he SHOUTS in MAYAN at them The other Mayans nock
fresh arrows draw their bows

Jeff takes a step backward half-raising his hands Amy just
stands there her eyes on the young Mayans motionless body

JEFF

AMY
(no reaction)

AY

She turns finally She looks horrified stupefied her
hands are burned a deep red from the vines sap Jeff waves
her up the hill She stares at him for another beat and
then without a word starts to climb the trail

Jeff hesitates watching the Mayans the bloodied corpse
the raised weapons the KEENING woman Then he too turns
and hurries off up the trail

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Amy Jeff and Eric have taken down the blue tent its
contents lie tumbled in a pile in the little clearing All
three of them look sun struck sweat-stained worn out

Eric is using a knife to cut long strips from the blue

Amy is braiding three of the strips together Jeff has one
of the backpack frames the roll of duct tape and some of
the poles from the tent hes making a backboard

ERIC
Maybe we could use it as a weapon
you know Wrap it around some
stones or something And throw

them like grenades I mean if

theyre that scared of it--

Jeff tears off a piece of tape with his teeth

JEFF

They have guns Eric And bows

What do you think theyll do if we

start throwing the vine at them

Eric is silenced by this He cuts another long strip of
nylon passes it to Amy But he cant seem to stop himself
from talking

ERIC

So you figure its what Sacred

or something Like you touch it

and you have to die

Amy begins to cry suddenly--a SOB quickly suppressed Jeff
and Eric both turn to look at her The vines sap has
scarred her hands and arms almost to the elbows She wipes
her eyes takes a deep breath shakes her head

AMY

Im okay

But she doesnt look it Jeff removes his hat holds it out
Amy just stares at it he nods for her to take it

JEFF

Come on Youre burning

She reaches for the hat puts it on then wipes at her eyes
again Jeff leans forward touches her
JEFF (contd)

Were gonna get through this All
right Well pull them up And

then I dont know--well figure
things out it has to rain at some
point And maybe we can snare some
birds Or--

The electronic RINGING sounds once more from the bottom of
the shaft They all turn to stare

THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
RUSTLING

The oil lamp has begun to smoke adding a haze to the light
Stacy is beside Mathias holding his hand Shes still
pressing Jeffs shirt to her wound The RING sounds again
Mathias turns his head peers toward the shaft cut into the
dirt wall to his left thats where its coming from Stacy
reaches to pick up the lamp rises to her feet Another
RING Jeff SHOUTS down from above

JEFF (0S)

Stacy

Stacy ignores him she limps around Mathias starts toward
the opening She hesitates at the mouth of the shaft
lifting her lamp to see better Theres another RING

-STACYS POV -- INTO THE SHAFT

The lamps light doesnt penetrate very far but WE can SEE
that the vine has taken root here with great avidity it
grows thickly on the walls floor and roof Theres a steady
draft coming toward us and the plant shifts in it

BACK TO SCENE
Stacy stands there looking scared Theres another RING

JEFF (0S)
Can you see it
Stacy lifts her head SHOUTS

STACY

No

She keeps peering into the shadows not moving The ringing
falls SILENT Stacy turns hobbles back toward Mathias and
the light shudders dims for a moment She squints at it
the oil is nearly gone She SHOUTS up to the others

STACY (contd)

The lamps almost out of oil

JEFF (0S)
Then blow it out

Stacy seems terrified by this

STACY
the

wick

Blow it out

JEFF Well need it when we come down

To get him on the backboard

Stacy drops into a crouch beside Mathias sets the lamp down
before her stares at it She clearly doesnt want to blow
it out Mathias watches her silent

JEFF (OS) (contd)

All right

Stacy leans forward lifts the lamps glass chimney blows
out the flame dropping the shaft into darkness

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DUSK

Thesun is just touching the horizon the sky turning red
Th eyve tied the braids of nylon onto the rope attached

finished backboard to them It rests beside the shaft
padded with one-of the archaeologists sleeping bags

Jeff and Eric remove their belts drop them onto the
backboard They step to the windlass lean against its hand
crank the rope going taut Amy stands by the shaft
gathering her courage Then she reaches for the backboard

THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
Mathias and Stacy are two dim shapes in the darkness The
windlass begins its CREAKING A long beat and then

AMY (0S)
Stacy

STACY
What

AMY - Light the lamp

Stacy shifts once again theres the RASP of a match then
the stronger illumination of the lamp as she lights its

Mathiass eyes are shut theres a deep RAGGEDNESS to his
breathing Stacy looks upward

STACYS POV - ABOVE HER
The backboard is dropping toward us Above it the light is
already fading from the sky

BACK TO SCENE
Stacy rises to her feet lifting the lamp

ON AMY - CROUCHING ON THE BACKBOARD

Shes dropping slowly down the shaft clenching the nylon
braids her eyes tightly shut terrified The backboard
sways pendulum-like as it descends almost touching the
vine-covered walls

THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

When the backboard comes within reach Stacy grabs it
pulling it to the-right so that it will come to rest at
Mathiass side But then with three feet still to go it
jerks to a halt almost toppling Amy from her perch

A beat and Jeffs voice comes toward them from above

JEFF (0S)
Have you reached them

AMY
Almost A few more feet

JEFF (0S
How many
Amy leans peers down at Mathiass broken body

AMY
I dont know Three

JEFF (0S

were out of rope

(a beat)

Can you still do it

Amy looks at Stacy neither speaks Finally QUIETLY

STACY
Well have to send it back up I
guess
examining

Amy doesnt answer She shifts her weight and the backboard
starts to swing Stacy reaches to steady it

STACY (contd)

Blow out the lamp Wait here in

the dark

Amy is silent staring down at Mathiass still form its
obvious she doesnt want to do this

STACY (contd)

Or we could try to lift him maybe

More silence Stacy persists

STACY (contd)

One of us at his shoulders The

other his feet

AMY
If he twists--

STACY
Its only a few feet
- Once more Amy is silent Stacy lifts the lamp

it the diminishing pool of oil

STACY (contd)

We have to decide The lights not

going to last

Jeffs voice comes toward them from above again

JEFF (0S)

Amy

They both look up the sky has grown too dark to see him
Amy hesitates one beat more then YELLS

AMY

She climbs off the backboard crouches beside Mathias Stacy
sets down the lamp

AMY (contd)

Mathias

She touches his shoulder and he opens his eyes stares at
her He looks haggard ashen

10111
different

AMY (contd)

Were going to lift you okay

Were going to hoist you up and

out

Mathias stares from her to the backboard to Stacy He shuts
his eyes Amy stands up drags the belts off the backboard
drops them next to the lamp She positions herself behind
Mathiass head Stacy hobbles to his feet limping

AMY (contd)

His hips

Stacy hesitates looking doubtful

STACY
You sure

AMY
If you lift from his feet hell
bend at the waist

STACY

But if I lift at his hips wont he

arch his back

They both stare down at Mathis imagining these two

scenarios Amy glances toward the lamp its dwindling oil

AMY

His knees

Stacy crouches by Mathiass knees a little off balance
favoring her wounded leg Amy bends sliding her hands under
his shoulders Mathias GROANS and Stacy starts to pull
away but Amy shakes her head

AMY (contd)

Quickly On three

They count together

STACY AND AMY

One two-three

They lift and Mathias immediately starts to SCREAM His
body sags at the waist he begins to thrash his arms Stacy
starts to set him down but Amy shakes her head SHOUTS

AMY
No
twisting

Stacys wounded leg is hindering her she cant keep up with
Amy Mathiass shoulders are level with the backboard but
his knees are still a good foot beneath it He keeps
SCREAMING The bend at his waist increases

AMY (contd)

Lift I

Stacy tries to hoist him higher lunging his torso

his SCREAMS going LOUDER His right arm hits the backboard
sends it swinging The girls toss him toward it

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT

The sun has set Theres a half moon giving us just enough
light to dimly see Eric and Jeff peering into the shaft
Mathiass SCREAMS echo up toward them

THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT - NIGHT

Mathias has fallen silent He lies on the backboard eyes
clenched sweat beading his forehead

Stacy is trying not to cry She watches Amy buckle the two
belts together then drape them over Mathiass chest knot
them tight Amy strips off her own belt gestures for Stacy
to do the same She buckles these together too

STACY

I have to pee

She limps toward the wall lowers her pants gingerly
crouches She stares toward the other shaft as she pees
its stone archway the shifting shadows the vine rustling
softly in the steady draught

Amy binds Mathias at his thighs She WHISPERS to him

AMY

You okay

She waits but he doesnt respond His eyes remain shut
Stacy rises buttoning her pants limps back toward Amy
Shes on the edge of tears is working hard to fight them
off Amy lifts her head SHOUTS up to Jeff

AMY (contd)

Pull him up

A moments pause then the windlass begins to CREAK once
more The backboard slowly rises swaying gently They
watch it climb away from them Amy holds out her-hand
ANY (contd)

Here

Stacy just stares at her not understanding Amy nods at the
lamp the oil is gone

AMY (contd)

Its gonna go out

And its true as Stacy reaches for Amys hand the light
suddenly flickers dims drops them into darkness

EXT CLEARINGBASE OF THE HILL - NIGHT

The Mayans are settling into sleep at their campsite Three
of the men remain on guard duty in the clearing facing the
hillside their backs to the fire The young Mayans corpse
still lies in the dirt fifteen feet in front of them The
firelight throws shadows across his bloodied body

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT

The windlass CREAKS loudly as Eric and Jeff work to wind in
the rope Stacy has already been pulled up from the hole
Shes sitting beside Mathias whos lying on the backboard
on the edge of the clearing by the orange tent

Amy emerges from the shaft dangling beneath the sawhorse
Jeff holds the rope taut while Eric steps to the hole pulls
Amy toward him Stacy watches from beside the backboard
Mathiass eyes are shut his breathing ROUGH with phlegm
No one speaks Once Amy is free of the sling they all move
to the backboard Eric takes Stacys-hand Jeff crouches
starts to undo the belts

ERIC

Shouldnt we carry him into the

tent first

Jeff pulls free the first belt shifts to the second one

JEFF
We cant

ERIC
Because

JEFF
Hes gonna keep leaking urine

AMY
But we cant just leave him out in
the open

JEFF

Well rig a shelter With whats

left of the blue tent

Jeff pulls the second belt free Mathiass eyes remain shut
JEFF (contd)

One of us should stay on watch

while the others sleep Two hour

shifts
He reaches for his knapsack unzips it He pulls out a liter
bottle of water

JEFF (contd)

-Once its light well figure out

how much water we have and how to

ration it Food too For now I

think we should each just take a

single swig

He uncaps the bottle hands it to Amy He watches her drink
from it When shes done she passes it to Stacy

JEFF (contd)

Eric and Ill build the shelter

You two should try to sleep

Stacy takes her single sip passes the bottle to Eric

INT ORANGE TENT - NIGHT

Stacy falls silent

AMY (contd)

Just go to sleep okay Lets try

Stacy lies down next to Amy in her-underwear and T-shirt
They huddle close together in the darkness

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT

Eric is building a tiny lean-to for Mathias using the duct
tape the leftover nylon and poles from the blue tent Jeff
crouches over the backboard He starts to cut Mathiass
jeans off him with the knife Mathiass eyes remain shut

ERIC
Whatre you doing

JEFF

We have to keep him clean

He slices the jeans from ankle to hip first one leg then
the other struggling not to jostle Mathiass body

JEFF (contd)

Thats how itll happen I think

if it does

ERIC

If what does

Jeff slides the soiled strips of-denim out from under
Mathiass body tosses them aside He LOWERS his voice

JEFF

If he dies here infection Blood
poisoning--something like that
Eric seems startled by this

ERIC
You think hes gonna die

JEFF

(he shrugs)

His back is broken Who knows what

else

Eric is silent motionless the tape in his hand Mathiass
BREATHING seems to be getting steadily worse Jeff bends to
cut off his boxers first one leg then the other He tosses
the soiled fabric aside

JEFF (contd)

We should go back down in the

morning

ERIC
Down

JEFF
Into the shaft Try to find the
phone again

ERIC
Theres no oil for the lamp
Jeff waves toward the orange tent

JEFF
Theres tequila We could pour it
on some of the clothes tie them
around one of these poles make a
torch
A sleeping bag is lying in the clearing among the strips of
nylon and aluminum poles Jeff steps over to pick it up
JEFF (contd)
Without the phone hes dead If

we have to wait for someone to come

searching

He shakes his head Then he leans forward and carefully
drapes the sleeping bag across Mathiass broken body

still

INT ORANGE TENT - DAWN

The orange nylon is just starting to glow with the suns
arrival Stacy and Eric lie beneath one of the sleeping
bags Erics head on her shoulder Jeff lies curled on his
side a few feet away still shirtless

Jeffs eyes open He sits up stares about then reaches for
one of the backpacks He quietly digs through it till he
finds a T-shirt He sniffs at it then pulls it on

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAWN
Mathias lies on his backboard eyes shut his breathing

sounding THICK WITH PHLEGM Amy sits beside him hunched
into herself half drowsing She lifts her head as Jeff
emerges from the tent stares at him

JEFF
How is he

AMY
The same

JEFF
And you

AMY
(she shrugs)
Tired Thirsty Hungry

JEFF

Once the others are up well have

some water

His face is stubbled sweat-stained He looks ragged they
both do He steps to the opposite side of the clearing
unzips begins to urinate with his back to Amy

JEFFS POV - ACROSS THE HILLTOP

The vine covers everything tangled and matted with those
odd knoll-like growths scattered among it The nearest-is
thirty feet away its leaves are swaying slightly in a faint
breeze and WE SEE a flash of yellowish white beneath them

BACK TO SCENE

Jeff finishes shakes zips then steps out into the vine
wading toward the tiny mound Amy remains beside the
backboard she watches him crouch part the tendrils stare

ANY

What is it

Jeff gestures for her to approach When she reaches him he
leans forward pulls aside the vines WE SEE a mans skull
a loose tumble of bones Amy INHALES sharply recoiling

JEFF

Bodies All of them

He waves across the hilltop at the other mounds there are
more than a dozen Amy takes them in The light is gaining

strength the green leaves seeming to shine in it the red

flowers to glow Jeffs face assumes a puzzled expression

JEFF (contd)

Where are the birds

AMY
Birds

JEFF
its dawn--there should be birds
They both stare off across the hillside so quiet so still

INT ORANGE TENT - DAY

Stacy opens her eyes She lies there struggling to orient
herself with Eric on her shoulder She starts to roll onto
her side then stops looking confused

She reaches under the sleeping bag toward her leg her
confusion changing to alarm She site up jarring Eric
awake and throws back the sleeping bag

ERIC

(BEFUDDLED)
What
too

snagged

The vine has grown dramatically during the night reaching
out from the pile of supplies at the rear of the tent to
spread across Stacys right leg almost to her waist She
sits up tries to push it off her

STACY

Oh my god

The vine is clinging to her she has to tear it the sap
shining slickly on her hands visibly beginning to burn the
skin She yanks at the tendrils tossing them aside

STACY (contd)

Help me

Eric sits up still only half-awake He just stares

STACY (contd)

Its inside me

Its true one of the tendrils has pushed its way into the
wound on her leg widening it thrusting itself a full three
inches into her body like a thick finger

STACY (cont d)

Oh Jesus--its fucking inside me

She tries to pull the tendril out but shes too panicky

quick and the vine breaks leaving a piece of itself

under her skin Stacy starts to SCREAM

STACY (contd)

Get the knifes

Eric is too shocked to stir Hes staring down at her leg
at the bulge beneath her skin it looks as if its moving

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Stacys SCREAMING continues Jeff and Amy are on their feet
hurrying across the clearing Mathias has opened his eyes

STACY (0S)

Get the knife

Jeff bends scoops up the knife starts toward the tent He
waves toward Mathias

JEFF
Stay with him
aside

Then he ducks in through the tents flap

INT ORANGE TENT - DAY

Eric is beside Stacy trying to calm her shes started to
CRY Her hands and wrists have turned a dark red and the
tendril is inside her leg just to the left of her shin
running parallel to it Jeff steps toward them

Jeff stares at the bulge hesitating Then it moves
unquestionably contracting and expanding like a worm
Stacy SHRIEKS

STACY (contd)

Jeff

JEFF

STACY

He leans forward slices into the skin above the bulge
Stacy CRIES OUT starts to jerk away but Jeff presses down
on her leg holding her still He reaches into her wound
with his finger digs out the piece of vine tosses it
JEFF

Get me a shirt or something

He gestures toward the backpacks and Eric unzips one of
them starts to dig through it

He pulls out a T-shirt hands it to Jeff Jeff wads it up
uses it to put pressure on the incision staunching the flow
of blood

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Amy is crouched by the backboard watching the tent trying
to grasp whats happening Mathias startles her by speaking

MATHIAS

Somethings wrong

His voice is thick-sounding very faint Amy tries to soothe
him she puts her hand on his shoulder

AMY

MATHIAS

AMY

MATHIAS

Hes struggling to rise straining upward Amy tries to stop
him pressing down on his shoulder

AMY

MATHIAS

Show-me

So she leans lifts the sleeping bag off him His lower legs
are completely covered by the flowering vine from the knees
down Amy and Mathias both stare in surprise Then Amy
reaches starts to yank the tendrils free

INT ORANGE TENT - DAY

Jeff is leaning forward pressing the balled-up T-shirt
against Stacys wound the blood darkening the fabric Stacy
is lying there her eyes shut fists clenched

STACY
I can still feel it

Jeff shakes his head

JEFF

STACY
I can feel it moving

JEFF
Thats just your body Your muscle
twitching

STACY
BUTAEe”

ERIC

Its on our clothes

Stacy and Jeff both glance at him Theres a faint almost
fungus-like green growing on his shirt an infantile version
of the vine covering the hillside all around them Its on
all of them their shirts their pants their shoes

Before any of them can respond to this development Amy
starts to CALL from the clearing sounding SCARED

AMY (0S)
Jeff
They all turn toward the flap Mathias begins to SCREAM
Amys voice JUMPS in volume
AMY (OS) (contd)
of I
them

Jeff rises moves toward the flap
EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Amy is crouched over Mathias frantically yanking the vines
off him Mathias is struggling impotently to sit up He
continues to SCREAM staring down at his legs

Jeff emerges-from the tent hurries to help Amy both of

tearing at the vine a flash of white appearing beneath the
green shiny and bright bones Mathiass legs have been
stripped completely clean of flesh from the knee down

As they keep pulling the tendrils free blood starts to drip
from Mathiass knees slowly at first but then suddenly
spurting spraying them their chests their faces Amy
jerks backward GAGGING RETCHING

She jumps up takes three steps into the center of the
clearing and VOMITS her hands on her knees She wipes at
the blood on her face COUGHS spits then bends again
another long ribbon of puke slipping free of her

Mathias continues to SCREAM and thrash Jeff reaches for the
belts lying in the dirt beside the backboard He quickly
ties first one then another around Mathiass legs twisting
them into tourniquets cutting off the flow of blood

Stacy and Eric stoop out through the tents flap they stand
there staring struggling to grasp whats happened Stacy is
in her underwear and T-shirt blood still seeping down her
leg Amy turns to face them
Mathias is WEEPING now his eyes shut The hemorrhaging has
stopped blood lies in puddles across the backboard Jeff is
covered with it And then there are the bones so white so
wet-looking from the knees down nothing but bone
Suddenly Stacy starts to SCREAM pointing past Amy at the
dirt beyond her They all turn to look
The vine is in motion a long tendril slipping into the
clearing moving snakelike toward the puddle of vomit at
Amys feet Amy backs quickly away

A second tendril emerges from the low wall of green around
the clearing then a third They move rapidly as if racing
each other both of them slipping alongside the first into
the little pool of vomit

The tendrils absorb the puke draining it until all thats

larger

left is a damp shadow on the rocky soil Then they withdraw
back across the clearing silently retreating into the

mass of green Stacy keeps SCREAMING
EXT CLEARINGBASE OF THE HILL - DAY

Faintly from up the hill WE HEAR Stacys screams The
Mayans are finishing their morning meal They eat in
silence showing no reaction to the sound In the clearing
the young Mayans corpse is buried beneath a thick growth of
vine

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

The four of them are sitting by the orange tent Jeff and
Amy are still spattered and smeared with Mathiass blood
Stacy is still in her underwear

e-

Jeff is inventorying their food and water The others watch
as he puts the perishables in a separate pile two bananas
a plastic bag ofgrapes going brown an orange a soggy tuna
fish sandwich

JEFF
They mustve dug it up

ANY
Who
He arranges the rest of the food in a second pile a bag of
pretzels a can of nuts two protein bars a box of raisins

JEFF

The miners

He puts the liquids in a third pile three bottles of water
two of iced tea a can of Coke Thats all there is

JEFF (contd)

And then the Mayans cleared the

jungle around the hill I guess

To keep it quarantined Thats why

they wont let us leave dont you

think Theyre afraid well spread
it

The others are silent Jeff reaches for the tuna fish
sandwich He carefully unwraps it

JEFF (contd)

Or elseI dont know Maybe its

something religious And were

some sort of sacrifice

He glances at the others but once again no one responds
They all look dazed knocked back into themselves Jeff
picks up the knife wipes it on his jeans

JEFF (contd)
They mustve done the same thing
with the archaeologists And
Henrich Trapped them here Like
us
He cuts the sandwich into four equal sections
JEFF (contd)
And then somehow it killed them

off All of them one by one

This is too much for Eric heleaps up looking panicky

goll

ERIC

We have to find the phone We have
to go back down and--

Jeff makes a calming motion

JEFF

Well eat first Drink some water

We have to stay calm Not rush at

things

He holds out one of the tiny squares of sandwich Eric
hesitates then accepts it dropping back into a crouch
Jeff hands Amy her square

AMY

What about Mathias

She nods toward him and they all turn to look From his
knees down Mathiass legs are nothing but bone tendon and
ropy clots of blackened blood His face looks gray His

eyes are shut and his breathing sounds terribly RAGGED
ATIENT

swallows

JEFF

He wouldnt be able to stomach it

Jeff offers Stacy her ration She takes it but almost
absentmindedly She seems distracted she keeps prodding at
her wound with her fingertip

JEFF (contd)

Stop it Stacy

STACY

Its still in there I can feel

it

She keeps probing Jeff shakes his head a little it

JEFF
I told you I got it out
Jeff pops his square of sandwich into his mouth Eric and

eat theirs too Stacys ration remains in her hand she
seems to have forgotten it Shes sunburned sweat-stained
glassy-eyed Eric leans toward her looking worried

ERIC
Eat Stacy You have to eat
She places the tiny sandwich into her mouth chews

staring at her wound the whole time Then

STACY
See How puffy it is

ERIC

Thats just swelling Its
natural

(he turns toward Jeff)
Right

JEFF

(he nods)

Its what happens when you get
hurt
Jeff picks up one of the water bottles twists off its-cap
He offers the bottle to Stacy

JEFF (contd)

one swallow apiece

The bottle makes its way around their little circle When it
returns to Jeff he takes his sip caps the bottle Eric is
watching Stacy her anxious probing he looks increasingly
distressed by it He jumps up again

ERIC

The phone Lets find the phone

Jeff doesnt move Stacys bloodied khakis are lying in the
dirt beside him and he reaches for them starts to cut off
their legs with the knife just above the knee

JEFF

We need to take care of Mathias

first He wont last much longer

like that

Amy looks appalled she makes a shushing motion

ANY

Shh

They all glance toward Mathias again He lies there eyes
shut breathing in and out with that fluid-filled RASP He
seems to be unconscious but Jeff still LOWERS his voice

JEFF
We have to cut them off

ERIC
Cut what off

JEFF

His legs

Hes finished with Stacys khakis theyve been transformed
into a pair of shorts He tosses them toward her Eric and
Amy are staring at him shocked into silence Then

ERIC

AMY
Without anaesthesia

JEFF
There wont be any pain He has no
feeling beneath his waist

ERIC
Hell lose too much blood

JEFF

Jeff holds up the knife Eric SCOFFS at the idea
ERIC (contd)

Amy is shaking her head she looks mortified

AMY

STACY

Stacy has stood up pulled on the shorts Jeff has fashioned
for her Shes bent over pointing at a spot on her leg a
few inches below the last incision

STACY (centd)

Sterilize the knife and--

Eric steps toward her tries to soothe her

ERIC
Theres nothing there Stacy Its

She hardly seems to hear him Shes frightened growing a
little wild with it Her voice comes FAST AND HIGH

STACY

ERIC
Youre imagining it Youre

Eric takes her hand squeezing it Stacy blinks at him

knees to her chest her eyes shut

STACY
See if theres a signal

Eric SIGHS steps to his pack crouches to remove his phone

Then he turns to Jeff

ERIC

JEFF

ERIC

Mathiass voice interrupts him from the backboard Very
HOARSE barely audible

MATHIAS

They all turn stare toward him His eyes are open
MATHIAS (contd)

Please

Cut them off

He slowly painfully extends his left hand toward them a
beseeching gesture

CU - SMALL PILE OF CLOTHES
A pair of shorts a womans blouse two black socks
an

fire

JEFF (0S)

Ill have to break the bones first

An amber liquid is being poured onto the clothes very
slowly WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Eric is crouched dribbling the tequila onto the clothes
pausing to let it soak in saturating the fabric Jeff is
kneeling by the backboard talking to Mathias

JEFF
With the stone Then Ill use the
knife to cut
A large stone sits beside the pile of clothes shaped like

ax head Theres the knife too and the metal canteen from
the orange tent

JEFF (contd)

Well heat the canteen and

cauterize the wounds with it To

stop the bleeding

Eric strikes a match the clothes catch instantly burning
with a low blue flame He sets the knife in the fire then
the stone and splashes more tequila on them The girls
stand in the center of the clearing watching

JEFF (contd)

You shouldnt be able to feel a

thing But you can bite this if

you want Just in case

He holds up one of the belts Mathias hesitates then opens
his mouth and Jeff sets it carefully inside Mathias clamps
down gripping it between his teeth Jeff glances at Eric
JEFF (contd)

Ready

Eric nods- The stone is making a cracking sound in the

glowing adeep red Jeff turns back to Mathias

JEFF (contd)

Mathias also nods shutting his eyes Theres a small towel
in the dirt beside Jeff and he picks it up wrapping it
around his hand He looks over his shoulder at the girls
They both seem terrified shaky with it

JEFF (contd)

You should wait in the tent

Amy starts to shake her head but then Stacy is in motion
grabbing her hand pulling her across the clearing and she
lets herself be led

Jeff watches them vanish through the flap then reaches
toward the fire with his towel-swathed hand He scoops up
the stone raises it over his head SLAMS it down with all
his strength against the exposed bones of Mathiass left

Mathias bucks GROANING his eyes jump open Jeff drops the
stone back into the fire snatches out the knife Mathias

trying to rise onto his elbow straining to see whats
happening

JEFF (contd)

Hold him

Eric sets the canteen into the flames sloshes some tequila
on it then shiftsto the backboard He presses down on
Mathiass shoulders Mathias is WHIMPERING twisting his
head back and forth gripping the belt tightly in his teeth
Jeff starts to saw with the knife chopping and cutting the
splintered bones Bloody marrow spills wetly out and then
Mathiasslower leg comes free of his body the foot and
ankle and shin bones completely separate now

Jeff lifts the bones away drops them into the dirt beside
the backboard Then he turns uses the towel to pluck the
canteen out of the fire it too is glowing red

He presses the canteen flat against Mathiass stump the
flesh SIZZLING and SPITTING Mathias bucks even more
forcefully he spits out the belt CRIES OUT

Jeff ignores him dropping the canteen back into the fire
lifting out the stone Eric looks increasingly mortified he
seems close to tears

ERIC

He turns SMASHES the stone into Mathiass right leg
Mathias begins to SCREAM bucking against Erics grip

INT ORANGE TENT - DAY

Mathiass SCREAMS fill the tent Amy and Stacy are sitting
together clutching each other Stacy is CRYING Amy is
staring toward the flap with a look of horror

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Jeff saws and chops at the shattered bones with the knife
Mathias continuesto SCREAM Eric is using all his weight to
hold him still his head averted his eyes clenched shut
Jeff lifts the severed bonesaway from the backboard drops
them at his side Then he scoops up the canteen again As

he presses it to Mathiass stump Mathias finally passes

his body going slack his screams falling SILENT
For a long beat theres just the SPITTING SNAPPING sound

Mathiass flesh being seared Then Eric pulls back into a
crouch shaking his head looking utterly depleted

ERIC
Oh Jesus Jesus Christ
Amy emerges from the tent then Stacy They stand staring

AMY

He felt it didnt he The whole

Jeff lifts the canteen away

JEFF

AMY
He was screaming Be was telling

Amy is shaking her head staring at Mathias with that
appalled expression his slack face his burned stumps

AMY
This is bad Jeff So bad
Jeff leans to loosen first one tourniquet then the other

JEFF
Weve bought him some time He
wouldnt have--

AMY

You cut off his legs You--

Stacy SCREAMS pointing toward Mathiass amputated limbs
Theyre lying in the dirt at the base of the backboard the
bloodstained bones held together with a few remaining cords
of flesh A vine has come snaking into the clearing its
wrapping itself around one of the feet

As the tendril begins to drag the bones away asecond one
slithers forward and lays claim to the other foot

Eric grabs the knife jumps up steps on the first tendril
bends to slash at it with the blade He swoops toward the
second one Even as he does so though a third tendril
slithers into the clearing then a fourth

Stacy SCREAMS again short and loud and backs toward the
tent Eric bends and slashes bends and slashes and

keeps coming from all directions reaching for the bones

JEFF

Leave it

Eric ignores him cutting and stomping and tearing at the
tendrils faster and faster but still too slow the vine
fighting back wrapping itself around his legs

JEFF (contd)

Eric

He steps toward him grabs his arm pulls him away They
stand side by side watching as the vine pulls the severed
limbs into itself the white of the bones vanishing into the
larger mass of green Stacy has begun to CRY again

Theres a beat of stillness and then once more echoing up
toward them from the shaft comes that faint electronic
RINGING of the cell phone

CU - THE WINDLASS
Spinning the rope spooling quickly off the barrel

JEFF (0S)
I dont know how long it11 burn--

WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
Eric is pulling the rope off the windlass laying it out in

long zigzag across the clearing Jeff is crouched by the
shaft making a torch The girls stand over him watching

JEFF

So youll have to be quick

He has one of the aluminum poles from the blue tent Hes
wrapped duct tape around its bottom for a grip tied some of
the archaeologists clothes around the top Hes dribbling
tequila on the knot of fabric saturating it

JEFF (contd)

Wait to light it till youre both

down there Then--

STACY

Jeff looks up at her startled by the question Eric is
moving along the length of rope bent low checking its hemp
for signs of weakness

JEFF

They all look bad but Stacy looks the worst her wounded
leg -her greasy hair a panicky edge to every gesture She
shakes her head with vehemence

STACY
No Jeff No way Not me
Jeff caps the tequila bottle gives Stacy a tired look

JEFF

Weve already been through this

Eric and I need to work the winch

Youre not strong enough

Eric has reached the end of the rope he stands up wiping
his hands on his pants

ERIC

Its clear

He moves to the windlass starts to wind the rope back onto
the barrel Theyve tied a sling on the ropes end again
Stacy is pressing her right hand against the bottom of her
rib cage massaging probing

STACY

JEFF

The torch wont last that long We

Stacy starts shaking her head again TERRIFIED

STACY

JEFF
You dont have a choice Stacy

AMY

Jeff ignores this He rises to his feet still focused on
Stacy WE can HEAR his growing anger in his voice

JEFF

Stacy is silent hugging herself staring at the ground
Eric has finished winding the rope onto the windlass He
tries to intervene

ERIC

JEFF-—-
Jeff ignores him his gaze on Stacy

JEFF

So thats what youre saying Just

willing to help him live

ERIC
Come on man Shes too scared

JEFF
I dont give a fuck Im scared

Eric is stepping toward him suddenly right up against him
forcing him back a step

ERIC

Hes bigger than Jeff stronger and this is suddenly very
palpable Their faces are three inches apart A tense beat
and then more QUIETLY

ERIC (contd)
WE

Jeff gives him a look of incredulity almost disgust

JEFF
Hard

ERIC

Just leave her be

Jeff turns away from him from all three of
off across the hill for a beat then shakes

JEFF
Im the only one thinking Im
carrying the whole fucking load

ERIC
So stop Lay it down
Jeff turns back to him gives him a look of

can HEAR his fury rising again as he speaks

JEFF

JEFF

JEFF (contd)

Stacy-is still staring at the ground her hand probing at

chest Its clear she doesnt want to go but Jeff has
shamed her into silence Amy reaches touches her arm

AMY

-11 be right there Okay Well

A long beat then Stacy manages a nod Its enough for Jeff
he pushes past Eric moving toward the windlass

JEFF
Get in the sling Amy
Amy turns reaching for the sling

EXT BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT - DAY

A faint fall of light from above Theres the CREAKING of
the windlass Amy is dropping slowly toward us When her
feet touch the bottom of the shaft she scrambles out of the
sling Then she lifts her head SHOUTS

AMY

Pull it up

The CREAKING resumes She stands there in the dimness
watching the sling rise away from her She has the makeshift
torch in one hand the box of matches in the other

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING

Eric is helping Stacy into the sling pulling it over her
head Stacys hands are shaking badly Eric hugs her trying
to calm her Jeff waits beside the hand crank

THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

Amy is in a crouch She keeps glancing toward the stone arch
cut into the shafts wall and the passageway beyond it the
vine dangles fromthe low ceiling like streamers at a

The CREAKING resumes and Amy looks up
AMYS POV - ABOVE HER
Stacy is dropping slowly toward us

BACK TO SCENE

Amy glances toward the arch again A slight draft blows
steadily from it and the vine shifts and trembles in it A
beat then the RINGING starts up once more Its coming from
within the shadowed passageway

Amy opens the box of matches plucks one out Shes too
jumpy though her hands are-trembling so much that she
shakes the match out as soon as its lit

Theres a second RING Stacy has nearly reached us

Amy digs another match from the box Stacys feet touch the
bottom of the shaft she yanks off the sling Theres a
third RING

STACY

Hurry

Amy strikes the match holds it to the knot of clothing at
the end of the aluminum pole The alcohol catches with a
FLUTTERING sound a cloud of pale blue fire materializing
around the torch Amy lifts it and they start into

THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE

Stacy is in front with Amy right behind her The torch
shudders weakly in the steady draft the shafts ceiling is
low enough that they have to crouch as they move forward
Theres a fourth RING drawing them deeper down the passage

The tendrils hanging from the ceiling brush against them
The vine is growing on the floor too--knee-deep--and from
the walls on either side Amy is moving cautiously
squinting into the darkness and Stacy starts to pull ahead

AMY

Wait

She pauses lifting the torch but Stacy keeps going Amy
peers at the vine hanging from the wall Theres a fifth
RING echoing eerily and the flowers move in exact unison
with the sound their stamens vibrating like so many
miniature tuning forks the plant is making the noise

AMY (contd)

Stacy
vines

The shaft dead-ends at a blank wall which is just
materializing out of the darkness fifteen feet in front of
them Theres a sixth RING Stacy points at the wall
quickening her pace

STACY
Its right here I can--
Amy jumps forward reaching for her

AMY

DONT--
But theres another RING and Stacy keeps going shes
nearly at the wall

STACY

ITs--

Stop

Amy grabs her arm hard jerks her back a step pulling her
close the torchlight flickering over them She WHISPERS
AMY (contd)

Theres no phone

STACY
What
A seventh RING sounds seeming to come from beneath the

on the floor of the shaft directly in front of them Stacy
tries to pull free to bend and reach toward the sound

STACY (contd)

I can--

Amy jerks her back again WHISPERS straight into her ear

ANY
Its the vine The flowers
Theyre making the noise

STACY

No Its--

She pulls free steps forward and her foot seems to punch
straight through the shafts floor She SCREAMS losing her
they

has

her

once

balances Amy throws down the torch lunges for her The
torch flutters pales but remains lit

The vines growing across the floor fall away revealing an
opening another shaft dropping into the earth Stacy is
slowly sliding into it scrambling to stop herself

Amy grabs Stacy arm Stacy is dangling from the waist down
ver the holes edge There are vines in the hole too and
hey begin to coil around her legs pulling at her dragging
er downward

tacy SCREAMS again kicking to free herself scrambling
pward monkey-like while Amy pulls at her and finally

cupydto

manage to drag her to safety

A beat then Amy retrieves the torch holds it out over the
hole The bottom is twenty feet down almost lost in shadow
Dimly WE SEE a woman lying curled against the wall--she

long dark hair

STACY (contd)

Oh my God

The woman stirs her body rolling as if to turn and look at
us and WE SEE her face shes a corpse The vine has
invaded her flesh--its in her eye sockets the hollow of

mouth writhing and churning Stacy and Amy SCREAM

Theres a WHISTLING sound like a whip and a tendril lashes
out from the shafts wall wraps itself around the torchs
handle yanks it from Amys grip The torch falls into the
hole still burning When it hits bottom a mass of vine
surges across it smothering its flame

Its very dark after this Amy and Stacy are barely
discernible A beat of silence then an odd high-pitched
CACKLING rises all around them it sounds like laughter--
eerie childlike full of echoes

As it steadily increases in volume that WHISTLING comes

more the vines SMACK at them from the floor the ceiling
the walls coiling around their bodies pulling them toward
the open shaft

They both SCREAM again scrambling backward while the vine
keeps coming more and more of it grabbing at their arms
their legs their necks They stumble over each other
at

it

as

that

their

falling onto their hands and kneesamid thetendrils

The vine catches at them tries to hold them down Its not
strong enough though they yank it off and thrash their
way foot by foot back toward the sling the vine lashing

them grabbing tearing sap leaking onto their skin The
laughter grows still louder the whole shaft ECHOING with

Amy reaches the sling first with Stacy right behind her
Even here the vine continues to attack them whipping and
HISSING and LAUGHING Amy holds the sling toward Stacy

AMY

You

But Stacy is too hysterical she just stands there SOBBING
SCREAMING Jeffs voice comes toward them from above

SHOUTING

AMY

NMI

She reaches out grabs Stacy wrapping her arms and legs
around her Stacy returns the embrace both of them
clutching at each other as the windlass finally begins to
CREAK lifting the two of them into the air

ON AMY AND STACY - IN THE SLING
The vines hanging from the shafts walls whip at the girls

they rise coiling around their bodies pulling at them
strange LAUGHTER growing ever louder seeming to buffet

bodies Stacy and Amy grip each other with all their
strength eyes shut tight Stacy SCREAMS
staring

she

peel

EXT CLEARINGBASE OP THE HILL - DAY

The SCREAM comes faintly toward us The Mayans are arrayed
about their campsite all of them motionless silent

up the hill with their impassive expressions
EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DUSK

The weather has shifted a wind has risen The sun is
setting a red smudge behind a dark gray wall of clouds
Mathias lieson his backboard unconscious his breathing
coming in that ragged RASP a thread of brown liquid leaking
from the corner of his mouth Amy is crouched beside him
she leans forward wipes away the liquid

Stacy sits in the clearing behind her leaning against Eric
Theyre both slick with sweat but Stacy keeps shivering as
if cold Erics arms are around her and her eyes are shut
Jeff is peeling the orange Like Amy hes still spattered
and stained with Mathiass blood The vine has continued to
grow on everyones clothes weblike eating away at the
fabric Jeff reaches tugs free a strand of it and a six-
inch tear appears in his T-shirt

Stacy opens her eyes she leans forward peers down at the
wounds on her leg her right hand moving to her chest
probing at her rib cage She turns to Eric

STACY

Check your phone

Eric pushes himself to his feet steps toward his pack He
pulls out his phone flips it open He shakes his head
STACY (contd)

Let me see

Eric carries the phone to her then stands over her while

opens it stares down at it She shuts it opens it again
Then again and again and suddenly shes CRYING bent into
herself Eric drops to a crouch rests his hand on her knee

ERIC

Shh

But her crying increases she begins to SOB Jeff is bent
over the orange dividing it into four equal piles--its

too--concentrating He lifts his head stares Amy stands
up hurries over kneels in front of Stacy takes her hand

AMY

Stacy keeps WEEPING uncontrollably shaking her head

STACY

Stacys tears keep coming Amy looks at Eric gives him a
nod prodding him into speech He hesitates then

ERIC
But she was scared of heights

AMY
So she became a lifeguard instead
(she squeezes Stacys

HAND)

Come on Your turn

More SOBS Amy glances across the clearing at Jeff wanting
him to join in too It seems as if he might refuse but
then her look hardens and he relents

JEFF
But she couldnt swim

AMY
So she wore a life vest
(she squeezes Stacys hand

AGAIN)

Come on Now you

A beat then Stacy takes a deep ragged breath She wipes at
her face struggles for words

STACY

She trails off CRYING again Amy nods encouraging her

AMY

STACY
They laughed at her

AMY

Good Thats good So she--

Very suddenly it starts to rain--a dozen large heavy
drops

They all glance skyward

JEFF

SHITAE¢

He springs to his feet And then a downpour a deluge as
if a trap door has swung open in the clouds The rain falls
in a loud drumming rush turning the clearing to mud
Eric jumps up too He and Jeff start digging through the
backpacks from the blue tent searching for something--
anything--in which to catch the water They find a small
plastic bag a nylon toiletry kit a Frisbee Jeff sets
these in a row on the ground open to the rain

Eric rushes to the orange tent vanishes inside Amy tilts
back her head tries to catch the rain in her open mouth
Stacy just sits there hugging herself shivering still

half-
crying Theyre all drenched back-spattered with mud

And then as abruptly as it had begun the rain starts to

slacken Eric reemerges from the orange tent carrying a

thermos a plastic cup He sets them next to the other

containers but its pointless the rain is already
stopping

They all stare at these meager receptacles theyve managed

to catch less than half an inch of muddy-looking water
Jeff

GROANS hes FURIOUS with himself

JEFF (contd)
We shouldve been ready We

SHOULD VE-
He kicks the Frisbee across the clearing Amy jumps up

AMY

JEFFT
She steps forward as if to guard the other containers

JEFF
It doesnt fucking matter

AMY
There was water in it
He spins toward her turning his fury with himself on her

JEFF

How much Amy Two and a half
gallons Cause thats what we
need For today--just to make it
through today And then tomorrow
the same all over again And for
how long Another week before our
parents start searching And then
what How long till they track us
to Coba Or to this fucking hill
How long will it take Amy

AMY
You said--
JEFF

Its not gonna happen Were not

gonna make it

The others stare at him in astonishment too
speak He gives them all a look of disgust
JEFF (contd)

And youre fucking playing games

(mimicking Amys voice)

So there were these people trapped

in the jungle

AMY
Dont Jeff

JEFF
But they didnt have any water

Amy looks as if she might start crying

AMY
Please dont

JEFF
So theyre gonna die of thirst

Amy covers her ears with her hands

AMY
Shut up

JEFF

But this fucking vine might kill
them first

AMY

(SHOUTING)

STOP IT

Jeff paces away struggling to regain control of himself

long beat and then very QUIETLY

JEFF

stunned to

A
Im sorry Im sorry

He steps back toward the dismembered orange crouches over
it The fruit and peels are muddy now spoiled looking He
waves for the others to approach

JEFF (contd)

Come on We need to eat

No one moves Theyre all staring at him with their shocked
expressions He cant seem to meet their eyes He gestures
at the orange again

JEFF (contd)

The peel too Everything

Abeat then the others step forward to claim their portions
first Eric then Stacy then Amy They eat without speaking
Finally almost AS IF TALKING TO HIMSELF

JEFF (contd)

Itll rain again It has to And

well figure out a way to catch it

(he nods to himself)

Well be fine Well ration the

-food And then you know well

justwell tough it out

(MORE )

JEFF (contd)

People have survived for weeks with

nothing Just water a little bit

of water So why not us

No one responds They continue to eat the fruit the
peels Their torn clothes cling wetly to them Jeff uncaps
the water bottle offers it to Amy She drinks passes it
on It moves around the circle back to Jeff

ERIC

What about the vine

Jeff takes his sip caps the bottle Hes reclaiming
himself his voice strengthening his confidence returning

JEFF

I dont think it can hurt us Not
directly if it could it already
wouldve wouldnt it Why would

it wait
The others are silent considering this Then

JEFF (contd)

Its not strong enough to overpower

us And it--

Mathias GASPS suddenly his entire body spasming for a
moment before the watery RASP of his breathing resumes He
doesnt regain consciousness his eyes remain shut Everyone
watches him for a beat he also is spattered with mud

AMY
Hes gonna die isnt he if
theres no phone then theres no--

STACY

Me too

They all turn to look at her Shes massaging that spot on
her rib cage again digging into it with her fingers
STACY (contd)

She waves toward the shaft Jeff gives her a weary look

JEFF
Dont Stacy Dont start
She jumps up begins to pace agitated

STACY

She stops pacing lifts her shirt She points to the base of
her rib cage

STACY (contd)

Jeff stares theres nothing there He shakes his head The
knife is lying in the mud beside him and Stacy steps
forward snatches it up Jeff reaches to stop her but hes
too slow She stands before him hefting it in her hand

JEFF

She lifts hershirt again pressing at her rib cage with her
fingertips Jeff stands up holds out his hand

JEFF

ERIC

STACY--

But shes already cutting a four inch slit along the base
of her rib cage Amy SCREAMS A horizontal line of blood
crests the wound sweeps down across Stacys stomach

into the waistband of her shorts She watches it frowning

STACY

I thought it would just come

tumbling out

She probes at the cut with the point of the knife prying it
farther open the bleeding increasing Jeff reaches grabs
the knife from her He looks furious

JEFF
Sit down

STACY

She pokes her finger into the wound digging Jeff slaps her
hand away He YELLS

ERIC

JEFF

JEFF

STACY
(shouting very loud)

YOURE NOT LISTENING

A beat of startled silence and then her voice comes again
from across the hilltop sounding exactly like her only
slightly fuzzed a rasping quality just beneath the words

STACYS VOICE

YOURE NOT LISTENING

They all turn to look but theres nothing there just the
vine its green leaves its bright red flowers Stacys
voice comes once more from theopposite direction now
STACYS VOICE (contd)

YOURE NOT LISTENING

ERIC

Stacys voice keeps coming switching locations seeming to
float across the hilltop they turn tracking it

STACYS VOICE

Stacys voice continues but now that high-pitched LAUGHTER
is coming too a chorus of it growing in volume

STACYS VOICE

Stacys weeping has deepened to SOBS She keeps YELLING

STACY
Shut up Shut up

clearing

The LAUGHTER grows steadily LOUDER obscuring Stacys voice
WE SEE the flowers trembling visibly vibrating as they
sculpt the sound

EXT CLEARINGBASE OF THE HILL - DUSK

The light is fading fast One of the Mayan women is cleaning
a pot with a handful of leaves Three of the men sit facing
the hillside their bows in their laps The others are
bedding down beneath the trees

The LAUGHTER echoes down the hill eerie and ghoulish yet
the Mayans betray no reaction to it as if it were no more
worthy of note to them than the steady RASPING of the

in the jungle at their backs

INT ORANGE TENT - NIGHT

Jeff Stacy and Amy lie side-by-side in the darkness The
liquid RATTLE of Mathiass breathing comes from the

sounding as if someone were sawing at a tin can

Jeff and Stacy are asleep Amy is stirring restlessly
shifting first onto one side then the other Finally she
rises moves toward the flap slips quietly through it

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT

The moon is out dropping its faint light upon us Mathias
is on his backboard beneath the little lean-to more audible
than visible with his PHLEGM-CLOTTED breathing Eric is
beside him He looks up as Amy emerges from the tent

ANY

Now is he

Eric shrugs waves toward the backboard it seems clear
enough Amy stares-for a moment then sits beside him

AMY (contd)

You can go lie down if you want

Eric lifts his hand pushes a button on his watch makes it
glow He squints at it
ERIC
I still have forty minutes

AMY

I dont mind I cant sleep

Eric checks his watch again its glow briefly illuminating
his face He gestures toward the tent

ERIC
Is Stacy

AMY

They both are

Theres a slight breeze and the tent makes a FLAPPING SOUND
in it They both turn to stare at it Then

AMY (contd)

Do you think its inside her

ERIC
(he shakes his head)
Jeff cut it out I saw him

AMY

But she says she can feel it
Moving Shifting about

Eric waves this aside

ERIC

You know how Stacy is Shes just

scared She gets things in her

head and---

Mathias makes a RETCHING sound--loud wet painful--and they
both turnaand€¢peering at his gaunt form through the darkness
He falls QUIET his eyes dont open A beat then

ERIC (contd)

Ive been sitting here you know

making all these deals in my head

with God You ever do that

Amy just stares at him He has his arms wrapped around his
knees hugging them to his chest

ERIC (contd)

Like I say okay you can fire me
on the first day teaching if thats
what you want--just let us make it
home But that doesnt mean shit
cause I dont even really want the
job and He has to know that

Stacy can leave me you know or
even I dont know Ill give up a
finger okay Or two fingers Or

And then I look at him--

(he nods toward Mathias)

--and I cant help it Im like

Mathias and let the rest of us go
Thats fucking horrible isnt it
And once Ive said it I feel like
I cant take it back you know

(MORE )

ERIC (contd)

Like the words have gone up into

the sky and Gods sort of thinking

about them now making his choice

and if Mathias dies and we dont

itll belike I killed him wont

it Like I--

Amy starts to CRY she covers her mouth with her hand Eric
stares at her in surprise

ERIC (contd)

What What is it

Amy shakes her head She struggles to stop but she cant

AMY

Im sorry Im so sorry
(a beat)

Its my fault

ERIC

AMY
If I hadnt stepped onto the hill--
Her crying INCREASES Eric leans touches her hand

ERIC

Eric reaches puts his arm around her trying to quiet her

ERIC
He didnt mean it Theres no way
He was just--

AMY

ERIC
Shh Dont
She rests her head on his shoulder WEEPING her body

with it while he pats her stroking her hair

INT ORANGE TENT - NIGHT

Stacy and Jeff eyes shut sleeping Very SOFTLY there
comes a faint PANTING rhythmic furtive sounding Stacys
eyes open she lies there listening

Theres a MOAN and the PANTING QUICKENS Stacy rises to a
sitting position She listens for another beat then leans
prods at Jeff He awakes with a jerk blinking up at her

JEFF

Wh--

Stacy holds her finger to her lips silencing him From
outside theres another MOAN Jeff sits up listening The
PANTING is BUILDING toward a climax Jeff leans toward the
pile of supplies at the tents rear squinting at the tangle
of vine growing across it He points WHISPERING

JEFF (contd)

Its the--
But Stacy is already pushing herself to her feet She moves
quickly to the tents flap UNZIPS it crouches out into

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT

Mathiass breathing continues its RAGGED course Amy is
still leaning into Eric her head on his shoulder He has
his arm around her He looks up blinking as Stacy emerges
from the tent into the moonlight

STACY
What the fuck Eric
Amy lifts her head wipes at her face Eric drops his arm
from her shoulder They both stare at Stacy startled by her
anger Jeff appears behind her stepping through the flap

ERIC
What

STACY
We heard you

ERIC
Heard me what

STACY
Fucking her

Eric looks from Stacy to Jeff completely perplexed

ERIC
Whatre you talking about

JEFF

The vine it made it sound as if

you two--

Stacy turns toward him SNORTING shaking her head

STACY
Youre so blind

JEFF
I could hear it At the back of
the tent It was--

STACY
It doesnt make things up It
mimics things Things its heard

JEFF
Then its heard someone having sex
at some point

Slowly quietly a tendril has begun to slither forward
through the darkness creeping in beneath the lean-to
snaking toward Mathias toward his head Jeff and the others

are all too focused on one another

STACY
That was Ay Jeff Moaning

AMY

What

Jeff reaches touches Stacys arm
but she flinches from him

JEFF

its doing this on purpose Cant
you see It thinks youre the
weakest--because youre hurt So
its trying to upset you Trying

TO--

STACY
Youre not upset He had his arm
around her He--

to notice

struggling to calm her

Amy leans forward hands out BESEECHING

AMY
Nothing happened Stacy I was
crying And Eric--

STACY
We he-ar you

The vine starts to push its way in between Mathiass lips
into his mouth Mathias makes a GAGGING sound but doesnt
regain consciousness once more no one notices

JEFF
We heard the vine It--

STACY

Youre such a fool Jeff You
think shes never cheated on you
Perfect little angelic Amy

AMY
Stacy

STACY
I could tell you secrets I could
open your eyes

AMY

Shi i up Right now

A second tendril has slithered under the lean-to It covers
Mathiass nose drawing itself tight The steady rasping of
his breathing is CUT OFF Yet again no one notices

STACY
Spring break Senior year

AMY
You bitch You stupid cunt
Stacy spins on her VENOMOUS

STACY

Fuck you Slut

(back to Jeff)

Twice Jeff Two different guys

And one of them--

Jeff grabs her arm grips it silencing hers

JEFF
Enough Stacy Stoll

Stacy falls SILENT she seems as astonished by what shes
said as everyone else
JEFF (contd)

Where do you think you are Huh
Why would you even care--at this
point if they were out here
fucking Were trapped We dont
have any food Or water And

MATHIAS--

He turns stares sees He darts forward starts to yank
away the tendrils They resist him writhing clinging to
Mathiass face Eric and Amy both jump up Stacy has
started to CRY shaking her head MORTIFIED

STACY

Oh godoh please no

Jeff bends close to Mathiass face listening he checks
Mathiass neck for a pulse A beat then he turns toward the
others shakes his head Stacy begins to SOB

STACY (contd)

Im sorryIm so sorry

Eric reaches takes her into his arms hugging her

EXT CLEARINGBASE OF THE HILL -- FROM UP THE HILL - DAWN

The hillside falls away from us the narrow trail winding
down its face to the clearing and the wall of jungle beyond
The sun is just rising and the vine seems to shimmer in it
Three of the Mayan encampments are visible from here one
directly beneath us one to the left another to the right
Thin ribbons of smoke rise from their campfires

EXT HILLTOP - TOP OF THE TRAIL - DAY

Jeff stands there staring down toward the jungle Eric and
Stacy are sitting together in the clearing behind him
holding hands Stacy is still CRYING softly Amy approaches
across the hilltop stops beside Jeff

JEFF

They mustve salted the soil

Thats the only way I can think

He turns glances at Amy She has no idea what hes talking
about He waves down toward the Mayans

JEFF (contd)

To keep the ground clear It grows

so quickly

He gestures at their clothes upon which that green webbing
of vine continues to spread eating away at the fabric
JEFF (contd)

Its old too--has to be Really

old Because the birds the

insects somehow theyve evolved

Theyve learned not to land here

(he peers about them at

the vine-covered hill)

And the horses Remember How

frightened they were They knew

too

They stand in silence for a beat staring down the hill
toward the Mayans Then Amy reaches touches Jeffs arm

AMY

It didnt happen

Jeff turns stares at her she waves back toward the tent
AMY (contd)

Eric and I we were just---

JEFF
I know

AMY

And what she said About spring

break I--

Jeff reaches presses his finger to her lips

JEFF

Shh

Amy falls silent watching him He lowers his finger
JEFF (contd)

Have you made it up with her

Amy half-nods half-shrugs

JEFF (contd)

Good

AMY
But I want to tell you--
sleeping

He presses his finger to her lips again stopping her He
waits a beat and then

JEFF

I wish it mattered

Amy gives him a confused look Jeff throws out his hand
gesturing at the hilltop the vine their tattered clothes
JEFF (contd)

Look at us

(a beat)

Would it matter to you

Amy hesitates considering Then she shakes her head And
with that Jeff turns starts back toward the orange tent
WE HEAR a zipping sound which carries over into

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
Jeff is crouched beside the backboard UNZIPPING the

bag Eric tosses the flimsy lean-to aside exposing
Mathiass corpse-to the sun Amy and Stacy stand watching

JEFF

Head first

Eric considers this staring down at Mathiass body
Mathiass face is burned red from the vines sap his legs
are two blackened stumps Eric shrugs

ERIC
I guess

JEFF

Youll have to lift him

Eric hesitates he seems reluctant to touch the corpse
Finally he girds himself straddles the backboard grabs
Mathias under his armpits lifting him Jeff leans forward
starts to pull the sleeping bag over Mathiass head

The corpse seems intent upon resisting them its arms keep
getting tangled catching and snagging Jeff and Eric have
to wrestle with it both of them PANTING sweating before
they manage to shove it into the bag

Jeff ZIPS the bag shut and they stand over it catching
their breath wiping the perspiration from their faces

ERIC
Should we say something

Jeff gives him a blank stare

ERIC (contd)

Like you know a prayer

Jeff frowns down at the bag searching for words Before he
can find them Stacy speaks

STACY

Wheres the knife

They all turn Her hand is under her tattered shirt
pressing at her lower back Jeff SIGHS

JEFF

STACY--

She lifts her shirt twisting to show him it looks as if a
large starfish has been implanted just beneath her skin
Its moving too inching slowly but visibly downward They
all stare in astonishment

Amy GASPS points at Stacys leg Stacy bends to see
theres more vine here a snakelike lump winding its way
upward from the top of her shin to her inner thigh

CU - FIRE
Another small pile of clothes burning with that blue
alcohol-fueled flame

AMY (0S)
Can I give her some
The knife is placed in the fire and WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Amy holds up the bottle of tequila Jeff is crouching over
the fire heating the knifes blade Be glances toward her
nods Stacy is sitting down staring at the bulge in her leg
with a dazed expression Eric is beside her

Amy offers the bottle to Stacy-they all watch as she takes

long swallow Then she hands the bottle back to Amy and
Jeff pulls the knife from the fire carries it toward her
He gestures to Eric and Amy

JEFF
Hold her hands
knife

They each take one of her hands Jeff crouches over her leg
JEFF (contd)

You might want to shut your eyes

Stacy shakes her head

STACY

I want to see

Jeff hesitates for a moment it seems-as if he might argue
But then very quickly he leans forward and draws the knife
in one smooth movement up and around Stacys leg Stacy
MOANS her body tensing but she doesnt cry out

The incision reveals the vine a foot long its leaves and
flowers clotted with Stacys blood which is oozing from the
wound Jeff reaches in pries the tendril from her flesh
Stacy MOANS again arching backward as the vine emerges
writhing and twisting The blood comes more thickly now
pumping from the wound running down her leg

Jeff drops the tendril into the dirt steps on it grinding
it into stillness Stacy is breathing HARD almost
hyperventilating Shes shut her eyes

JEFF

Should I stop

Stacy shakes her head vehemently Jeff glances at the
others Eric shakes his head too Amys eyes like
Stacys are tightly shut

JEFF (contd)

Youll have to roll over

Stacy lets go of the others hands rolls onto her stomach
She hitches up her shirt revealing the small of her back
he starfish-shaped bulge Jeff crouches at her side

EFF (contd)

t
J
R
She nods and he leans makes five quick incisions in the
shape of an asterisk directly above the bulge Stacys body
goes rigid and Eric takes her hand again Once more we can
see the tendril through the incision dark with her blood
Jeff reaches in and slowly pulls the vine from her body
Theres an astonishing amount of it he has to drop the

and use both hands to drag the slimy mass free

As the plant emerges from her body--thrashing coiling and
uncoiling covered in half-clotted blood like a newborn--
Stacy starts to SCREAM

EXT CLEARINGBASE OF THE HILL - DAY

The Mayans at their campsite three of them on guard duty
the others napping in the shade beneath the trees Stacys
SCREAMING echoes down the hill toward us

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Theyve pulled a shirt from one of the backpacks torn it
into strips and used these to bandage Stacys wounds tying
them around her leg and torso Shes lying on her side eyes
shut her head in Erics lap Hes stroking her hair

Jeff is counting the grapes into four separate piles Amy
sits watching him When he finishes he gestures for her to
take a pile Then he scoops Stacy and Erics rations up
carries them over

JEFF

Can you eat

Stacy sits up wincing her bandages are soaked through with
blood She takes the grapes from him Eric does too They-
all begin to eat in silence When theyre done Jeff passes
the water bottle around their circle Then

JEFF (contd)

We should try to rest I guess

(he waves toward the tent)

Get out of the sun Were losing

moisture out--

STACY

Theres more of it

She leans forward probes at her right thigh prodding the
skin The others watch her theres no bulge visible no
sign of the vine-at all Eric gives her a pained look

ERIC
Theres nothing there Stacy

STACY
Its under the muscle Down by the
bone
forward

She keeps pushing at her leg She glances from Eric to Amy
to Jeff No one says anything

STACY (contd)

Cut me and see Right here

She uses her finger to draw a line up her thigh

JEFF
Youre losing too much blood And
if any of these get infected---

STACY

My calf too

she lifts her right leg turning it to show the others Jeff
bends to look Again theres no visible sign of the vine
He shakes his head

JEFF
No more cutting Not unless---—
The knife is in the dirt beside him and Stacy leans

tries to grab it Jeff is too quick for her though he
snatches it up tucks it into his belt Stacy is becoming
more and more upset She holds out her hands BEGGING

STACY
Please Jeff

ERIC
You cant You cant keep--
Stacy is starting to CRY her mouth is trembling

STACY

Its everywhere

Shes prodding at her body her legs her chest and stomach
Amy scoots toward her grasps her hand

ANY

STACY--
Stacy yanks her hand free clutches her scalp WEEPING

STACY
Its in my head I can feel it in
my head
Amy takes Stacy in her arms hugging her tight

AMY

Shh

Stacy SOBS into Amys shoulder her body jumping Amy
strokes her Eric steps across the clearing picks up the
bottle of tequila He glances at Jeff and Jeff nods

AMY (contd)

Youre scared honey Youre just

scared You know

Stacy nods shes still CRYING but its growing quieter
Eric crouches beside her holds out the bottle of tequila
Stacy just stares at it Amy encourages her

AMY (contd)

Itll help

Stacy accepts the bottle takes a long swallow Then
another The others watch her in silence Finally

AMY (contd)

Can you rest some In the tent

Stacy is silent She wipes the tears from her face

STACY

That girl--

(she waves at the shaft)

I keep seeing her When I shut my
eyes

AMY

(NODDING)

I knowI know

(she stands up holds out

her hand)

Lets just lie down for a bit

Okay

Stacy hesitates staring up at Amy Then she reaches grasps
her hand Amy pulls her to her feet helps her hobble across
the clearing to the tent Jeff and Eric sit-there watching
in silence as they vanish through the flap
out

INT ORANGE TENT - DAY

Sunlight filters through the orange nylon all four of them
lie sleeping in a row sweating The vine has shredded their
clothes to tatters they look like castaways The tents
flap hangs open billowing gently in a slight breeze

Stacy open her eyes She lies there staring up toward the
orange nylon above her The blood on her bandages has dried
to a dark red bordering on black She sits up stares about
the tent Eric is on one side of her then Amy then Jeff
Jeff is on his back the knife still tucked into his belt
Stacy rises quietly steps over Amy crouches above him
staring down at the knife She reaches tries to slip it
free but then jerks back when Jeff shifts in his sleep
She hesitates watching him She seems as if shes about to
try again but then the tent flap billows in the breeze
drawing her gaze A beat and she rises steps carefully
over Jeff ducks outside into the clearing

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Stacy stands just beyond the tentsflap All is still
quiet- She moves to Erics pack crouches over it pulls

his phone She flips it open stares down at its screen
theres still no signal She drops it back into the pack
She turns-to examine the clearing her eyes falling upon the
two backpacks from the blue tent Their pockets are zippered
open Jeff and Erics hurried pillaging during the downpour
has scattered their contents across the dirt

Stacy rises steps toward this tangled mound She starts to
dig through it casually at first but then with growing
intensity throwing T-shirts and jeans and shorts aside
probing deeply into the pile
Suddenly she goes still Staring Amid the sodden mass of
clothing sits a knife in a small scabbard
As Stacy crouches there the vines start to RUSTLE a
rippling motion passing across them as if a wind were
sweeping the hillside Stacy watches with a look of horror
it looks like the pelt of some giant animal shaking itself
When it finally stops she bends reaching for the knife

him

INT ORANGE TENT - DAY

Jeff Eric and Amy still sleeping The tents flap
continues to billow in the breeze Very faintly from the
clearing WE HEAR a moan Then the sound of WHIMPERING
Eric opens his eyes listening An instant later very
abruptly there comes a sharp rending SCREAM of pure pain
Eric jumps up starts for the flap Jeff is right behind

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Eric emerges from the tent then Jeff then Amy They stand
there staring too horrified to move

AMY

Oh my God

Stacy is on the far side of the clearing Shes pulled off
her shirt her shorts and has cut much of the skin from her
body She doesnt notice them Shes bent over slicing

into her left thigh peeling the skin back from the muscle

ERIC

STACY--

She turns blood-streaked wild-eyed the knife in her hand
her skin is hanging from her in shreds We can see her leg
muscles her abdominals a glint of bone at her left elbow
Jeff starts forward holding out his hand very STERN

JEFF
Give it Now
Eric follows him Amy stays by the tent shes begun to CRY

AMY

Please honey Just--

Stacy shakes her head shes CRYING too her whole body
shaking Her hair is matted with blood she looks terrified

STACY
I have to get it out Its--
she

him

Jeff darts forward tries to grab the knife from her and

slashes at him SHOUTING

STACY (coatd)

Leave me alonel

The blade slices into his palm Jeff jumps back cradling
his hand at his chest

STACY (contd)

I have to--

Eric steps toward her from behind reaching around her body
for the knife and she spins reflexively trying to fend

off But the knife is in her hand and it punches into his
chest just to the right of his sternum sticking there

Eric looks at the knife in surprise Its twitching back and
forth with the beating of his heart He starts to reach for
it but then his legs give out He collapses dropping to
the dirt which has grown muddy with Stacys blood

Amy SCREAMS

Stacys CRYING deepens she takes a step toward Eric but
then her own body fails her She falls to her knees in the
bloody puddle reaching toward him

STACY (contd)

Oh nonono Im--

Eric is on his back he struggles up onto one elbow He
tries to speak but only a GAGGING sound emerges blood
frothing at his mouth Its pumping thickly from his wound
too saturating his shirt

STACY (contd)

I didnt

Eric drops back again He struggles RAGGEDLY for breath
Jeff lowers himself to his knees beside him hesitating
impotently over him uncertain what to do Stacy is SOBBING
shaking her head Theres blood everywhere

STACY (contd)

Kill me

Jeff turns stares at her Amy steps forward crouches
beside her She takes Stacys hand

ANY
Shh
STACY
Please Just--

ANY
Shh

STACY

It hurts It hurts so much

Eric tries to rise again The blood surges from his wound
when he moves Jeff presses him back down

JEFF
Easy Try to--
Stacy clutches at Amy begging her voice HOARSE with pain

STACY

Kill me I cant

She stops in mid-sentence staring Jeff and Amy follow her
gaze A half dozen tendrils are snaking into the clearing
reaching toward Erics body

Jeff jumps to his feet The tendrils begin to wrap
themselves around Erics limbs and Jeff bends to tear them
away More and more keep coming though Eric has started
to convulse GAGGING his head cocked back

Jeff keeps yanking the tendrils away but there are far too
many of them they coil around Erics legs pulling at him
The blood has stopped pumping from his wound his body has
gone still

AMY
Jeff
She points toward the tent Jeff turns to see

JEFFS POV - ACROSS THE CLEARING

The sleeping bag in which theyd enshrouded Mathias is
moving hes thrashing about within it struggling to sit
up And hes SHOUTING too his voice MUFFLED by the bag

MATHIASS VOICE

HENRICH HENRICH
He seems to be tearing at the bag with his arms
out

and

BACK TO SCENE

Jeff hesitates just for an instant staring in astonishment
then hes sprinting across the clearing He bends struggles
for the zipper

JEFF
Its okay Im right here Im--
He UNZIPS the bag and an immense tangle of vine cascades

onto the dirt Its flowers are a pale pink theyre opening
and closing still calling louder now

MATHIAS S VOICE

HENRICH HENRICH
The thick clot of tendrils writhes spasmodically coiling

uncoiling

Entwined within it are Mathiass bones already stripped
clean of flesh The vine falls SILENT A beat then it
starts to laugh a low mocking CHUCKLE

On the opposite side of the little clearing Stacy begins to
SCREAM shaking her head SOBBING

STACY

KILL ME KILL ME
Jeff stands there perfectly still Amy is holding Stacy
struggling unsuccessfully to quiet her

AMY

Shh Shh

The vines laughter grows steadily LOUDER punctuated by
Stacys SHOUTS

STACY

KILL ME KILL ME

Amy turns stares at Jeff Blood is running off Stacys body
in strings The vine has dragged Eric to the edge of the
clearing only his head and torso are still visible Jeff
strides toward him
STACY (contd)

KILL ME KILL ME
Jeff bends yanks the knife from Erics chest Then he

starts across the clearing toward Stacy

EXT CLEARINGBASE OF THE HILL - DAY

The Mayans in their campsite Theyre all staring up the
hill listening Stacys voice ECHOES toward us

STACY (0S)

KILL ME KILL MEI KILL--
And then abruptly it goes SILENT

EXT HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

Amy sits beside Stacy who lies on her back in the puddle of
blood arms thrown out the knife stuck hilt-deep in her
chest Erics body is barely visible at the edge of the
clearing the vine RUSTLES softly as it consumes him

Jeff is pulling their remaining supplies from his knapsack

the bananas the raisins the pretzels the protein bars
the

nuts the water iced tea and Coke He has a bloody strip

of fabric tied around the wound on his hand

Amy watches as he arranges the food in front of her Shes

CRYING silently tears running down her dirt-smeared cheeks

Jeff peels one of the bananas its dark brown far too

ripe He holds it out to her She just stares at it

JEFF

Come on Youll need the energy

He reaches for her hand puts the banana in it She holds
the fruit but makes no move to eat Finally VERY QUIETLY

AMY
I still think we should wait
Jeff SIGHS its clear theyve already been through this
around

JEFF
Youll only get weaker

AMY
Theyll come looking You said

THEY LL--

JEFF
Nobodys coming

AMY
Our parents--

JEFF

All theyll find are our bones

Amy is silent staring down at the banana

JEFF (contd)

We dont have time for this Amy

Youll need as much daylight as

possible

He waves upward toward the sun which has passed its peak
begun its slow slide westward Amy squints toward it for a
beat and then almost despite herself lifts the banana to
her mouth She bites chews swallows still mutely crying
Jeff peels the second banana he hands it to her as soon as
she finishes the first Be watches her eatsilent Hes
tearing open the bag of pretzels when another tendril snakes
into the clearing

They both watch it neither of them moving Its joined by a
second tendril then a third a fourththe vines coil

Stacys body begin to drag it from the clearing Amys
CRYING grows more forceful her body shaking

JEFF (contd)

Shh

Jeff reaches strokes her The vine pulls Stacys body into
itself burying it Amy watches struggling to control
herself Her voice emerges as little more than a WHISPER

AMY
I dont want to I dont
face

She shakes her head wipes at her face the tears the snot
the sweat the dirt Her clothes are falling off her body
eaten to shreds Jeffs too

AMY (contd)

Why cant we both

Jeff hesitates abeat Then clearly not believing it

JEFF
We might
He hands her the pretzels she takes them watching his

AMY
How

JEFF

Itll take them a moment to react

If I can make it to the trees

He trails off shrugs Amy keeps staring at him she doesnt
believe this either He SIGHS again holds up his hand
pulls the bandage from his wound its three inches long a
deep gash into his palm

JEFF (contd)

How long till its inside me

Amy is silent He flexes his hand and the wound opens
mouthlike blood oozing thickly from it

JEFF (contd)

It already is probably Ill be

just like Stacy soon

He turns glances toward the spot where her body has
disappeared Amy looks too

JEFF (contd)

Then what You all alone on this

hill you know how that would end

dont you

Once more Amy is silent He waves for her to keep eating
and she starts in on the pretzels mechanically He opens
the can of Coke hands it to her she takes a long sip
JEFF (contd)

Once youre in the jungle you drop

and hide

Another tendril slithers forward It slips into the immense
continues

the

puddle of blood beside Jeff and Amy begins to drink it
JEFF (contd)

Theyll never find you--its too

thick in there Just burrow down

and theyll run right past

Jeff opens the can of nuts sets it in front of Amy Then he
gets up crouches over the puddle of blood He cups his
hands dips them into the puddle He steps toward Amy
smears the blood across her T-shirt Amy keeps eating
JEFF (contd)

Its sudden movements thatll get

you caught So take your time

You step then listen Then

another step and listen again

He moves back to the puddle which the lone tendril

to drain He cups his hands scoops up more blood smears it
on her tattered khakis Amy has finished the pretzels she
reaches for the nuts looking numb

JEFF (contd)
East always east--keep the sun at
your back
He scoops up more blood from the puddle

JEFF (contd)

Arms

Amy holds out her arms and he smears the blood on them
JEFF (contd)

Youll hear me yell Ill yell

your name

He returns yet again to the puddle then stands over her

blood cupped in his hands dripping

JEFF (contd)

And you cant hesitate

Understand Not for an instant

Amy nods and he uncups his hands over her head She shuts
her eyes as the blood runs into her hair down her forehead
her neck her face

EXT CLEARINGBASE OF THE HILL - DAY

Three of the Mayan men as usual sit in the clearing bows
like

in their laps facing the hill The others are sheltering
from the sun in the line of shade along the jungles margin
some sleeping some talking quietly together

One of the men in the clearing suddenly rises to his feet
nocking an arrow The other two also rise The Mayans along
the clearing fall silent staring up the hill

THE MAYANS POV - UP THE HILL
Jeff is approaching down the trail carrying Amy pieta-

in his arms Her body is limp apparently lifeless and
dripping with blood

BACK TO SCENE

The bald Mayan emerges from the tree line followed by yet
another man with a bow They join the other three Mayans in
the center of the clearing They all watch as Jeff reaches
the base of the trail where he carefully lays Amy down
Jeff crouches over Amy laying her arms across her chest
pushing the hair from her face He bends kisses her blood-
smeared forehead Then he glances up at the Mayans

JEFF

You dont even know her name

The Mayans just stare at him He rises to his feet pulling
the knife from his belt its darkly stained with blood
JEFF (contd)

You should You should know who

youre killing

He steps out into the clearing The bald Mayan pulls his
pistol from its holster raises it aiming at Jeffs chest
The others draw their bows Jeff smiles taps his sternum
JEFF (contd)

Jeff Understand My names Jeff

He edges along the clearings margin keeping close to the
vines moving away from Amys body The Mayans follow him
weapons raised After a handful of steps he stops again
turns toward them

JEFF (contd)

Can you say it Huh

Again the Mayans just stare He SLAPS at his chest

JEFF (contd)
Jeff
A beat then he suddenly YELLS waving the knife at the men
JEFF (contd)

SAY MY FUCKING NAME

Silence The Mayans stand there with their weapons raised
waiting to see what he might do A beat then he starts
walking once more along the clearings edge away from Amy
Another ten yards and he stops again waves up the hill
JEFF (contd)

Theres Stacy too And Eric

Mathias And Henrich Youve

illed them all

He steps toward them The bald man raises his hand holds it
up palm out next to his pistol Jeff smiles at him again
JEFF (contd)

But not everyone

He LAUGHS a little wildly and shakes his head

JEFF (contd)

Look at you you stupid fucks You

have no idea what Im saying do

you

He takes another step into the clearing The bald man COCKS
his pistol loudly Several of the other Mayans have emerged
from the jungle they stand there watching

JEFF (contd)

One of us is gonna survive You

should know that name too You

fuckers You bastards

He takes yet another step forward The bald man speaks a
string of words IN MAYAN with an edge of warning More
Mayans emerge from-the jungle shielding their eyes against
the sun staring No one is looking in Amys direction
JEFF (contd)

Its not Jeff

He shakes his head his voice dropping almost to a WHISPER
JEFF (contd)

Its not me

He takes another step And then still QUIETLY

JEFF (contd)

Its Amy You hear

He takes a deep breath gathering himself Then he YELLS--
stomach

crawl

JEFF (contd)

AMY

--and starts to run straight at the Mayans He only manages
three steps before the bald man FIRES his pistol and the
others let their arrows fly

The bullet hits Jeff in the chest just beneath his throat
One of the arrows misses the other three strike his

his left arm his right thigh Before he even hits the
ground theres a SHOUT from the Mayans along the treeline
The bald man turns Amy is on her feet sprinting for the
jungle The bald man raises his pistol FIRES but the shot
is too hurried it goes wide The others are still
scrambling for fresh arrows as she vanishes into the trees
The bowmen sprint after her disappearing into the jungle
leaving the bald man alone in the clearing with Jeff The
Mayan women stand motionless along the treeline staring
after Amy they look mortified grief-stricken

Jeff is bleeding heavily from his wounds struggling to

forward his breath frothing pinkly at his lips A half
dozen tendrils slither into the clearing They coil around
his legs start to drag him back toward the hill Jeff
fights them kicking MOANING bleeding

The bald man watches He too looks grief-stricken He
steps forward aims at Jeffs head As he FIRES WE

CUT TO A BLACK SCREEN
WE HEAR footsteps moving quickly down a tiled floor

DOCTOR (0S)

(a slight Spanish accent)

She flagged down a tour bus just
west of Coba--

The voice CARRIES OVER into

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOVING - NIGHT
A Mexican DOCTOR in his late fifties balding a little

stooped his white jacket buttoned over a shirt and tie is
hurrying down the corridor accompanied by TERESA a dark-
haired woman in beige slacks a blue blouse

Teresa has- a leather briefcase a Blackberry on her belt
Shes holding Amys passport which she examines as they
walk Its smeared with dried blood

DOCTOR

--and collapsed before the driver

even managed to open the door

The corridor is brightly lit very clean Rooms open off it
on either side and we glimpse the stillforms of sleeping
patients as we pass IVs hanging from metal stands beside
their beds Its very quiet

DOCTOR (contd)

She revived briefly just after

they brought her in She was in

bad shape--severely dehydrated

traumatized in shock And

terribly frightened It was

impossible to make any sense of

what she was saying She was

sobbing hysterical We had to

sedate her

The doctor has a manila folder under his arm he opens it
pulls out a piece of paper a color printout of a digital
photo He hands it to Teresa

DOCTOR (contd)

Her clothes were torn she was

covered in blood But not her own

Teresa stares down at the photo it shows Amy on a gurney
unconscious blood-smeared corpse-like

TERESA
Now do you know

DOCTOR

She has no wounds

A uniformed policeman sits on a chair outside one of the
rooms at the end of the corridor reading a newspaper He
rises as they approach Teresa hands the printout back to
the doctor she keeps the passport

TERESA
then

slack

Thats it Thats all you have

DOCTOR
Im afraid so
Be nods to the policeman and leads Teresa into

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

A bed a night stand a curtained window Amy lies with a
sheet pulled to her chin unconscious an IV dripping into
her arm Theyve cleaned the blood off her

A NURSE sits in a chair beside the bed Shes in her early
twenties with long dark hair tied in a bun She stands up
stepping back from the bed as the doctor and Teresa enter
The doctor addresses her in SUBTITLED SPANISH

DOCTOR

Has she stirred

The nurse shakes her head The doctor moves to the bed He
takes Amys wrist feeling for her-pulse Amys eyes open at
his touch She stares at him her arm hanging limply in his
grasp He smiles down at her

DOCTOR (contd)
There you are
Teresa steps forward and Amys gaze shifts to her

DOCTOR (contd)
My name is Dr Hernandez

Amys eyes return to the doctor they fall on his face

drift down to his chest The doctor gestures toward Teresa

DOCTOR (contd)

And this is Ms Bern from the US

Consulate

Amy is staring at his white coat her expression going

almost catatonic all the life draining from it

DOCTOR (contd)
we were hoping you might be able to
shed a little light on what youve
been through
Amy is silent still staring with that dead look in her eyes

at the doctors coat a faint green web of vine has taken

root there spreading across the white fabric WE HOLD on it
for a beat and then

THE END
