INT SHURI’S LAB - WDG - 2025 (ONE YEAR AFTER ENDGAME)

SHURI (20s) storms into her lab moving with frantic urgency

LIGHT PROJECTIONS of several DOUBLE HELIX DNA MODELS are
arranged through the lab like pillars

WDG SCIENTISTS work nervously

SHURI
His heart rate is dropping fast
Where are we

WDG SCIENTIST
I’m finishing a sequence now

SHURI
GRIOT give me the controls

Shuri takes control of the holograms as they appear

The Double Helix turns from GREEN to RED The WDG Scientist
deflates

Shuri’s eyes dart desperately over the holographic model

SHURI (CONTD)

Shuri runs over to a 3D printer where lasers begin to build
a mature HEART SHAPED HERB SEED

GRIOT (V0O)
The synthetic herb will have a less
than 30 chance of effectiveness

SHURI
I DON’T CARE
(to herself)
Come on come on come on

Tears well in Shuri’s eyes as the herb is printed She pulls
it out and turns for the door but stops as she sees RAMONDA
standing in the doorway her face tear soaked

UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE

Mr Chairperson I believe I speak
for all of the member states when I
say I am deeply disappointed by
Wakanda’s failure to stand by the
promises made after the blip by the
late King T’Challa Promises to
participate in global efforts to
tackle international challenges to
share resources technology and
full technical cooperation
concerning vibranium

(beat)
Promises Mr Chairperson that the
Queen of Wakanda is failing to
deliver on The United States
shares a deep concern over the lack
of Wakanda’s transparency and urges
meaningful dialogue in consultation
with key partners and Wakanda to
strengthen efforts to achieve our
commitments to international
development and security Thank
you Mr Chairperson

The Other Dignitaries nod in agreement Ramonda looks back
silently and strongly

CHAIRPERSON OF UN
My thanks to the Secretary of State
of the United States of America for
that statement I now give the
floor to the Minister of Foreign
Affairs for France

SECRETARY OF STATE OF FRANCE (SUBTITLE)

(in French)
Thank you Mr Chairperson France
has information that states
vibranium has limitless potential
as a renewable energy source And
yet Queen Ramonda has still
declined to open access to the
material through international
trade or any of Wakanda’s
philanthropic ventures We also
have information that vibranium can
be used to make weapons of mass
destruction It is a substance that
does not trigger any known metal
detector It could be smuggled It
is a direct threat to the global
security environment and the
nonproliferation regime

The Secretary of State of France continues

SECRETARY OF STATE OF FRANCE (SUBTITLE)

(in French)
I would like to put the question to
her majesty “Why is there so much
secrecy around this particular
resource” “If her nation’s
intentions really are to help other
nations why is that help only
extended to certain groups of
people in those nations” And “what
of our intelligence in France in
Belgium and in the United States
that vibranium has properties that
can be weaponized”

(beat)
Mr Chairperson Wakanda has
deliberately chosen in a recurrent
manner to defy our collective
security architecture The
durability of our international
security would be at stake if we
were to overlook the potential
threat of vibranium today Thank
you Mr Chairperson

CHAIRPERSON OF UN
My thanks to the Minister of
Foreign Affairs for France I now
give the floor to her majesty
Queen Ramonda

Ramonda leans into her mic

RAMONDA
Thank you Mr Chairperson
Wakanda’s offerings to the global
community do not begin and end with
our nation’s most valuable
resource It has always been our
policy to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance Not because
of the dangerous potential of
vibranium but because of the
dangerous potential of some of the
people in this room

Queen Ramonda of the nation of
Wakanda gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday decrying
repeated attempts by mercenaries to
steal vibranium from Wakandan
outreach centers including the
latest attack in Mali The Queen
released evidence proving the
attackers had been hired by the
French government causing an
uproar in the international
community Queen Ramonda had thus
far taken a conciliatory stance
towards other world powers since
her ascension to the throne six
years ago after King T’Challa
disappeared during the Blip
Although King T’Challa returned 5
years later along with half the
world’s population Queen Ramonda
remained in power through King
T’Challa’s death one year ago
today Many believe that Princess

Ramonda thinks for a beat while Shuri gathers herself

SHURI
Do you have anything planned

RAMONDA
Yes It involves you taking your
mother for a drive

SHURI
Right now

RAMONDA
Yes And you can leave your kimoyo
beads here You won’t need them
where we’re going

Shuri reluctantly takes them off and sets them on the table
Green Rev 20A
RAMONDA (CONT’D)
The other ones too Shuri

Shuri sighs then pulls hidden kimoyo beads that look like
earrings from her hers

SHURI
Ok Mother where to

Green Rev 21

OMITTED 48

Tan Rev EXT RIVERBANK - WAKANDAN BUSH - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

Shuri scoops water from a river while Ramonda tends to a
fire A makeshift shelter sits behind them

RAMONDA
In the River Tribe we have a
ritual to honor our connection to
those that have passed on

SHURI
There is a ritual for everything
here Somebody has died you have
to do the ritual My neighbor hates
me oh just do ritual I can’t find
a boyfriend don’t worry there’s
a ritual for that

RAMONDA
After your father died I performed
this ritual with T’Challa by my
side and Nakia

Tan Rev 23

SHURI
Ugh Don’t mention her name I know
she hated being here but that is
no excuse for missing his funeral

Shuri hands a gourd to Ramonda and looks deep into the flame

RAMONDA
If rituals are pointless to you
why does it bother you that she
wasn’t there that day What is a
funeral if not a ritual

SHURI
Because that was my brothers’ day
And for some stupid reason rituals
mattered to him I don’t have time
for this Mother I need to get
back to my lab

Suddenly they hear a stirring in the bush They observe as a
MOTHER ELEPHANT emerges from the brush with her TWO BABIES

Dangerous and majestic she gently ambles over to the
riverbank with her young in tow

The Mother Elephant sprays water from the river onto her
young bathing them and herself underneath the moonlit night

Ramonda and Shuri observe this quiet almost spiritual
moment

RAMONDA
You need to sit here with me and
with yourself It’s the only way
you are going to heal from the
wound T’Challa’s death caused

SHURI

I have healed

(beat)
I wake up every day and I work on
things for Wakanda’s future Even
though my brother is gone

(alt)
I’m not like I was before I’m
moving forward even though my
brother is gone
Tan Rev 24

RAMONDA
T’Challa is dead But that doesn’t
mean he is gone When Thanos took
you and your brother from me I had
to lead a wounded nation and a
broken world But I still took time
in the bush I wandered until I
found water and I sat then I did
this ritual that I am about to show
you now I found your brother in
the breeze Pushing me gently but
firm like his hand on my shoulder
And I found you in the chirp of the
sunbirds It took some time but
you both were there

SHURI
But that wasn’t us mother In the
snap everything that we were
ceased to exist Our presence was a
construct of your mind Brought on
so you could experience comfort or

joy

RAMONDA
And what construct does your mind
create when you think of your
brother
(beat)
Do they offer you comfort Or
torment

Shuri thinks on this moved by her mother’s question Ramonda
stands up

RAMONDA (CONT’D)
Come child

She leads Shuri back to the fire She goes to her knapsack
and pulls out a pile of white garments Shuri stares
affronted Ramonda hands a garment to Shuri

SHURI
How did you get these

RAMONDA
What does it matter

SHURI
These are my clothes How do they
figure into your ritual
2nd White Rev 24a

RAMONDA
Burning the funeral garments marks
the end of the mourning period

Ramonda casts her clothes into the fire

RAMONDA (CONTD)
And the beginning of a new
relationship with our loved ones
that have passed on

RAMONDA

2nd White Rev 25

Shuri stares off

SHURI
It’s not torment I feel It’s rage
My brother who saved me saved
Wakanda saved the world He showed
kindness and grace even to his
enemies And for what For the love
of his life to run off and never
come back For some illness to take
him before he was old enough to
grow gray hair An illness Not
even an enemy in combat

RAMONDA
And that would have been better

SHURI
Yes Because then I could take my
revenge I don’t want to sit with
you and think of my brother
because I fear it won’t be clothes
I will want to burn it will be the
world and everyone in it

Ramonda looks at Shuri with compassion

RAMONDA
Shuri there is something I have to
tell you about your brother-

But then something in the water startles the Mother Elephant
who rears back and SHRIEKS LOUDLY She and her children RUN
in the opposite direction as

Shuri and Ramonda perk up Ramonda stands and walks down
toward the river where the WATER STIRS

SHURI
Mother What are you doing

Shuri runs to Ramonda’s side just as A MAN’S head breaches
the surface of the river and NAMOR rises up flying over the
surface of the water toward Ramonda and Shuri He carries a
CONCH SHELL his winged ankles on full display

SHURI (CONTD)
This better not be a part of the
ritual

RAMONDA
It’s not

2nd White Rev 25A

Shuri and Ramonda assume battle stances traditional spears
extended

RAMONDA (CONTD)
Stop Right there Who are you
And how did you get in here Speak
trespasser

Namor smiles and holds his hands up He looks at Shuri almost
as if they have met before

NAMOR

I mean you both no harm This place
is amazing The air is pristine
Not a trace of pollution

(looks back at the water)
And the water

(beat)
My mother told stories of a place
like this A protected land with
people that never had to leave
never had to change who they were
What reason did you have to reveal
your secret to the world
Tan Rev Ramonda points her spear venomously now

RAMONDA
I am not a woman who enjoys
repeating herself Who are you

NAMOR
I have many names

RAMONDA
Which one did your mother give you

Namor smiles at her bluntness

NAMOR
She named me Ch’ah Toh Almehen
citizens of my realm call me
Ku’Kul’Kan and my enemies call me
Namor

SHURI
What kind of name is Namor-

RAMONDA
Hush child
(to Namor)
Why are you here

NAMOR
We have a problem The American
military detected Vibranium
embedded beneath my nation’s
domain I was able to stop them
from mining it but I need
Wakanda’s help to prevent it from
happening again

RAMONDA
Vibranium exists only here in
Wakanda

Namor offers the queen a questioning glance in response
Shuri looks closely at Namor’s adornments

SHURI
Mother he’s covered in it

Ramonda observes Namor’s VB necklace and earrings

RAMONDA
Where are you from

NAMOR
The oceans

as
Tan Rev 26A

Shuri jumps in

SHURI
And the Americans detected it
there How Detecting vibranium is
practical impossible

Namor turns to Shuri

NAMOR
They used a machine that we
confiscated Did you help them
build it

SHURI
Of course not

NAMOR

We have information that the
machine was designed by an American
scientist But we could not find
any record on their identity I
would prefer to deal with the
scientist as opposed to waging war
on the entire nation

(beat)
I imagine Wakanda has more diverse
methods of gathering intelligence
and could find the identity of the
scientist and bring them to me

RAMONDA
Why should we help you

NAMOR
Your former King exposed the power
of vibranium to the world In
response other nations have begun
scouring the planet for it We do
not wish to be exposed but your
choices have compromised us It is
only fair that you help resolve our
dilemma

RAMONDA
You don’t sneak into our country
and tell me what is fair Wakanda
will look into it if we deem it
necessary

Namor smiles at this
Tan Rev 27

NAMOR

I have more soldiers than this land
has blades of grass But my only
desire is that my people remain
hidden from the world I hope you
can understand my urgency because
I would hate to come back under
different circumstances

(beat)
There is a beautiful island off the
coast of Madagascar Nosy Nato Do
you know it

RAMONDA
I do

Namor places the conch on the ground

NAMOR
When you have the scientist blow
into this and place it in the ocean
on the north beach I’1l1 be there
shortly afterwards

Namor turns to head back into the river as Ramonda and Shuri
sit with his threat for a moment He peers back

NAMOR (CONTD)
And please for your sake don’t
mention anything about me to anyone
outside of Wakanda

Namor eyes Shuri slyly

NAMOR (CONT’D)
Princess

Namor dives back into the river DISAPPEARING BENEATH THE WATER
Shaken Ramonda and Shuri share looks

SHURI
Did you see those things on his
ankles

RAMONDA
(impatient)
Come on Shuri

Shuri reluctantly starts back for the shelter with Ramonda
only to freeze as sitting by their fire dripping with water
is the LARGE VB DETECTOR from the cargo ship Ramonda and
Shuri gape at it

Yellow Rev 28

RAMONDA (CONT’D)
We must convene the council

INT TRIBAL COUNCIL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

M’BAKU flanked by FOUR JABARI WARRIORS marches in with a
leisurely swagger chomping a PURPLE BROCCOLI STALK

Ramonda Okoye Ayo Aneka and the TRIBAL ELDERS (RIVER TRIBE
ELDER MERCHANT TRIBE ELDER BORDER TRIBE ELDER and the
MINING TRIBE ELDER) are all gathered around in a circle

The DORA MILAJE are flanked out across the room in their
traditional spots THREE NAVAL OFFICERS are here as well
contrite

Everyone gives wary looks as M’Baku enters prepared for his
antics He doesn’t disappoint

M’ BAKU
So our river border has been
breached I once more offer the
support of my Jabari Hell-
screamers If my soldiers were
present this fish man would be
bound before us as we speak

OKOYE
If you’re soldiers were present
they’d still be choking on their
furry costumes

RAMONDA
Show some respect you two

M’ BAKU
Respect They allowed an outsider
to walk directly up to our Queen
What good is Wakanda if we cannot
protect our borders These men
should not show their faces

(to River Tribe Elder)

Why are they guarding the river
anyway Because they did well in
swimming school

M’Baku points to M’BELE one of his accompanying warriors

M’BAKU (CONT’D)
Take M’Bele there He swims with
the gracefulness of a cinder block
but he would die before he allowed
a fish man to swim up to our Queen

Yellow Rev 28A

RAMONDA
M’Baku if you are done with your
lecture I would like to discuss
the matter at hand
Tan Rev 29

OKOYE
There is no aerial surveillance
footage of him

NAVAL OFFICER
And nothing on radar as well

The elders look at the officer like he is out of his mind

RIVER TRIBE ELDER
So he swam underwater for 60 miles

RAMONDA
And claims to command a massive
army

MERCHANT TRIBE ELDER
He wants us to deliver one American
scientist So he can kill them

RAMONDA
He didn’t explicitly state that
but I believe that is his
intention

MINING TRIBE ELDER

So do it

(off the council’s

reactions)
We have never faced an enemy with
access to Vibranium before and we
have no Black Panther to protect
us

M’ BAKU
Because this wise council allowed
Killmonger to take the throne and
burn up all of your precious Heart-
Shaped Herb

Ramonda ponders this

RAMONDA
What would you have us do

M’ BAKU
We find the fish man and kill him

BORDER TRIBE ELDER
Who is being foolish now You would
have us make war with a man we know
nothing about At least we have
intelligence on the Americans

Goldenrod Rev 30

The room sits with this
M’ BAKU
If we do what he wants now what’s
to prevent him from coming back and
asking for more

Ramonda considers

INT SHURI’S LAB - WAKANDAN DESIGN GROUP - DAY - LATER 51

Shuri has the VB DETECTOR in pieces like a mechanic STUDYING
its parts with deep fascination as Ramonda and Okoye walk in

Okoye observes a hologram of the MIDNIGHT ANGELS prototypes
Shuri clocks this

OKOYE
Princess is it just me or did
these things get uglier

Shuri rolls her eyes

SHURI
It’s you I haven’t touched them
since the last time you saw them

Ramonda studies the vibranium detector

RAMONDA
So does it work

SHURI
Yes I’m still not sure how they
did it though It can detect the
altered frequency of vibranium
through water stone even heavy
metals
(beat)
Whoever built this is brilliant

RAMONDA
Brilliant like you

SHURI
Of course not But it’s strange -
the parts are mismatched Some are
custom others look like they
pulled it from a junkyard

RAMONDA
Have you ever tried to make one
here
Goldenrod Rev 30A

SHURI
Vibranium is all around us We have
never needed anything like this
Necessity breeds invention

Okoye ponders this

OKOYE
I can’t believe it exists outside
of Wakanda How is that possible

SHURI
Perhaps the meteorite that struck
the continent broke apart as it
entered the earth’s atmosphere The
planet is mostly covered by water
It’s reasonable that some landed
there

RAMONDA
This changes everything we know

OKOYE

The Great Mound All of the legends
and fables Those stories are
seared in my mind

SHURI
That sounds very painful

Okoye ignores her
Goldenrod Rev 31

OKOYE
(to Ramonda)
So we must find this scientist
after all

Shuri goes back to studying the detector as Ramonda and Okoye
start for the door

RAMONDA
Do the War Dogs have any leads

OKOYE

Nothing

(beat)
I have an idea but I’m going to
need the Princess

(alt)
No but I have an idea I’m going
to need the Princess I have to
deal with that churlish little
American She’s good at that

RAMONDA
Out of the question She is in no
state to be in the field

OKOYE

My Queen with all due respect It
would do her some good to get out
She has been isolated in this lab
since it happened May be just what
May be just what she needs

(beat)
Besides I can handle an American
assignment with my eyes closed

RAMONDA
It is not the Americans that I am
worried about
(unnerved)
This Namor he snuck past our
defenses

OKOYE
It won’t happen again

RAMONDA
He wasn’t alone

Okoye thinks on this

I can assure you Wakanda had
nothing to do with this

ROSS
Then who was it

Ross eyes Okoye unconvinced Okoye stares back silently

ROSS (CONTD)
See the way this is supposed to
work is I give you information
and you reciprocate

For our own safety we can’t tell
you But it’s imperative that we
get to this scientist before
anything else happens

I wouldn’t be here otherwise

You owe me You owe my brother

Ross relents

ROSS
You know there are officers who
have been sentenced to death for
less than I’m about to give you
And weve got a new director

RAMONDA
I recognize some of the concepts
here But you are using different
materials

NAKIA
We are using what we can find here
in Haiti I wanted the school to be
self sufficient

Nakia nods Noticing the irony of this
Tan Rev 63A

RAMONDA
You were missed at T’Challa’s
funeral

Nakia looks away hurt

NAKIA
It can’t have been easy to bury
your son I was afraid of how final
the funeral would be

RAMONDA
No matter where you go you are
still Wakandan Nakia daughter of
Yaa And you know that death is
not the end

Nakia nods

NAKIA
I have been seeing the reports The
outreach seems to be going well

RAMONDA
It is But that is not why I’m
here

Tan Rev 64

RAMONDA (CONTD)
Shuri has been taken

Nakia gasps and takes a long beat

RAMONDA (CONT’D)
You have infiltrated many nations

NAKIA
That was a long time ago I was a
different person then Queen
Mother I

RAMONDA

I need someone who can find where
she’s being held and rescue her
without being seen I lost my son
You were not there to help me
through it I can’t lose my
daughter as well

Nakia considers this deeply Steps forward

NAKIA
It’s been awhile since I have done a
mission I will need a few things

Ramonda nods pleased

NAKIA (CONT’D)
Who on Bast’s green earth is foolish
enough to risk War with Wakanda

RAMONDA
Not on earth Below it in the
oceans

Nakia’s jaw drops

RAMONDA (CONTD)
They spoke a Mayan dialect I
imagine we could start in their
ancestral homelands You served in
that region before and you still
have contacts

NAKIA
Old ones But I think I may know
where to start

Tan Rev AYO
Okoye You know I cannot let you
board this aircraft

OKOYE
I will not rest until I find her
with or without the Queen’s
blessing

Okoye walks right past Ayo who bristles and pivots to watch

her approach the ship Ayo lets out a YIP

Okoye looks on as the DORA MILAJE emerge from behind the
aircraft and form a line blocking her path to the aircraft

She looks to her right as SEVERAL KINGSGUARD emerge as well

Okoye stops and turns to face Ayo

AYO
We have every war dog and every
wakandan satellite searching for
her

OKOYE
And have they found her yet
(beat)
I will not rest knowing she is
still out there

Okoye starts towards the Talon Fighter

AYO

Okoye ignores the command Ayo bangs her spear one the

ground

and on cue the Dora lower their spears towards Okoye The
Kingsguard do as well Okoye stops and reaches for her sword

AYO (CONT’D)

You trained us All of us Don’t
make us spill your blood

Okoye grips her sword doing math on the numbers

warriors)
Just enough

Okoye takes her hand off her weapon and walks back towards

the moat Just as she passes Ayo-
Tan Rev 64B

OKOYE (CONTD)
The gold looks good on you

Ayo dismisses the Dora but Aneka stays behind With the
landing pad empty she turns to Ayo angered

ANEKA
Beloved Namor is out there with
our Princess What harm is it in
having Okoye out there searching
for her She is the only one who
has faced them in battle

OKOYE
It is the Queens orders She is a
civilian now

ANEKA
And is her orders as well for the
Dora to stand here guarding
vehicles
(beat)
Where is the Queen now

AYO
I cannot say

ANEKA
Is it because you can’t tell me or
because you don’t know

AYO
It is because it is outside of the
scope of your responsibility

Aneka takes a moment before

She hands Ayo her spear and walks off

The Mayan Elder slides a cocoa drink on a table in front of
Nakia as she recounts her story They speak in Spanish

NAKIA (SUBTITLE)

--The storm had smashed our boat
against the rocks I thought we
were all going to die but a man
with winged feet lifted our boat
off the shoal to safety No one
else saw him They thought I was
mad But I felt his power I need
to find him again To thank him
Tan Rev 64D

Nakia seems to be relieved after unburdening herself The
Mayan Elder stares at her with unblinking eyes

MAYAN ELDER
You are very gifted To you lying
comes as easy as breathing

NAKIA
I’m sorry

MAYAN ELDER

I am willing to give you the
information you seek But it will
not be without a price I want the
truth about who you are

(beat)
Your secret will not leave the
walls of this hut

NAKIA
I am Nakia daughter of Yaa War
Dog to the Kingdom of Wakanda I’m
in search of my friend

The Mayan Elder smiles at this

MAYAN ELDER (SUBTITLE)

When I was young we would play in
the rainforest and sometimes would
catch a glimpse of a man with winged
feet on the shore of the beach or a
river Sometimes as a form flitting
through the sky

(beat)
We thought he was a spirit not a
man The K’uk’ulkan Our Feathered
Serpent God of this realm and the
realm below

NAKIA
A god How is that possible

The Mayan Elder nods continues

MAYAN ELDER (SUBTITLE)
On my wedding night my husband and
I left the celebration to swim in

We got swept out by the currents

MAYAN ELDER (SUBTITLE) (CONTD)
I lost grip of Josue’s hand and
started to drown until I felt
myself being lifted out of the
water He brought me back to the
shore Josue unconscious but alive
on the sand Saved by K’uk’ulkan

NAKIA (SUBTITLE)
I would very much like to visit
that beach

The Mayan Elder considers this request With a bit of
compassion in her eyesand suspicion

MAYAN ELDER (SUBTITLE)
I can tell you where it is But be
warned K’uk’ulkan has been here
for much longer than you or I He
has saved some but others who have
searched for him with ill in their
hearts have never returned Lost to
the depths forever

It’s a makeshift room inside of a cave decorated by Mayan
artifacts and KELP FURNISHINGS a couple hammocks etc
GLOWWORMS line the cave ceiling
Goldenrod Rev 65

Shuri lies in a HAMMOCK unconscious She jolts awake and
peers around clocking a TALOCANIL WARRIOR in the corner

Shuri reaches for her Kimoyo bead earrings and tries to turn
them on no dice they are too far underground She
exhales in frustration then looks around more seeing RIRI
unconscious in another HAMMOCK

Shuri paces over to her and gently wakes her Riri jumps up
in a panic

RIRI
What happened What’s going on

SHURI
Riri calm down we’re okay

Riri scans the room and starts hyperventilating

clothing We had this made for you

Shuri and Riri have no idea what Namora is saying She
extends the dress to Shuri

RIRI
Do you understand her

SHURI
Not completely

NAMORA
(Maya with subtitles)
It is your choice whether to wear it
but not doing so would be considered
disrespectful

RIRI
No way you should put that thing
on It could be for a sacrifice or
something Or like a movie cliche
Woman is given pretty dress
Princess Leia Belle from Beauty

Indiana Jones

Shuri takes the dress

SHURI
I think it might be their custom

Weber Azul) growing out of the pool Namora nudges her toward
Namor Shuri smiles charming him

NAMOR
You are safe here Princess I will
not allow any harm to befall you
while you are in my custody

Namora exits through the pool leaving the two royals to talk
Shuri looks around at the hut it contains several Post-
Classic Period Mayan artifacts and paintings and many other

treasures

Shuri is drawn to beautiful BRACELET WITH JADE ADORNMENTS
fascinated

SHURI
I like this one

Namor smiles
NAMOR
Funny that you should gravitate
towards that That was my mother’s
Namor walks up to Shuri who takes a close look at him
SHURI
This is a Mesoamerican artifact
Most likely 15th century

Namor nods

EXT TULUM OUTSKIRTS - DAY - 1571 AD (NAMOR FLASHBACK) 114

A PREGNANT WOMAN stands on the beach search in the sand for
something She finds it a jade stone We track with her to a
dense jungle near the beach where we find a clan of Yucatec
Mayan People gathered in a clearing near a beach

NAMOR (VO)
My father was a Purepecha traveler
but he found love and paradise in
piece of the Americas that you
would call Tulum today Then it was
Zama

Some are afflicted with smallpox and it is clear that they
are hiding out and waiting

NAMOR (VO)

My mother and her village were
driven from their maize farms by

The Shaman emerges from the cenote holding the blueish
tinted Weber Azul plant

EXT MOUTH OF CENOTE - DAY - 1571 AD c1i14
The Shaman mixes the plant into a blue potion

In a daytime ceremony the Shaman distributes the potion to
all of the members of the tribe

Namor’s Mother argues with the elders about drinking the
potion out of fear of what it will do to her baby

NAMOR (VO)
My mother was pregnant with me at
the time She did not want to
ingest the plant for fear of what
it may do to me But the Shaman was
convincing

EXT TULUM OUTSKIRTS - DAY - 1571 AD A115

The elders point to the smallpox lesions on her face and
reason with her that she doesn’t have a better option She
doesn’t relent until the shaman fashions a BRACELET from a
strand of the Weber Azul plant He places it on her wrist and
tells her child will be the first born in the new world

She along with all the other tribal members drinks the

potion and they all fall unconscious It looks like a mass
suicide

EXT BEACH - TULUM - SUNSET - 1571 AD 115

Namor’s Mother opens her eyes her smallpox lesions are
completely gone but she is gasping for air through newly
formed GILLS on her neck unable to extract oxygen Her skin
turns iridescent blue She looks around as other members of
her tribe come back to life but are panicking as they are
“drowning” trying to breathe air

The Shaman awakens and runs into the surf Namor’s Mother and
the other tribespeople follow suit
Tan Rev 70A

Once they are in water they are able to breathe through
their gills and their skin’s natural complexion returns

The plant took away their ability
to breathe air but it enabled them
to draw oxygen from the sea

We see that Namor has toured Shuri around paintings that
describe the story he just told Shuri is moved

SHURI
Why are you telling me all of this

NAMOR

So that you understand why I must
kill the scientist Colonizers came
to our land in search of chocolate
and rubber and devastated my people
Now they are coming for our metal We
are more vulnerable than you We have
no sonic shields or cloaking devices
And the seas are being explored to a
greater degree everyday

(beat)
It is my duty as K’uk’ulkan to
protect what we have preserved here
at any cost

Shuri nods earnestly

SHURI
I understand But what if we kept
her in Wakanda Let us go and I
promise she will remain in my

country
NAMOR
I cannot risk that Princess
SHURI
Keep me then and let her go
Namor eyes Shuri Their gaze interested

Tan Rev 72A

NAMOR

Well you can’t go down there in
that Hypothermia would grip you
almost instantaneously Your blood
would become toxic The pressure of
the ocean would break every bone in
your body and even my considerable
strength couldn’t save you

the large CITY OF TALOCAN and its RESIDENTS come into view
The lanterns in the city are BIOLUMINESCENT

Awed Shuri watches people going about their daily lives
noticing their skin is BROWN and not blue

NAMOR
Now you see We are you and you
are us

She sees a BALLGAME being played and KIDS passing them

Shuri processes this as her gaze falls on an UNDERWATER GARDEN
of kelp seaweed underwater maize and the blueish Weber Azul-
like PLANT the Shaman emerged from the cenote with in Namor’s

flashback A cheerful group of TALOCANIL YOUTH work the crops

SHURI
(astonished)
You can grow corn underwater

NAMOR
They are teaching each other
playing and working all at once

SHURI
Can we go there

NAMOR
Maybe another time It is a sacred
place This way

Namor leads Shuri through the city toward a Mayan Mountain
structure A SASTUN (an underwater light source) GLOWS in the
water above it with the same quality of bioluminescent light
as the city’s lanterns

They stop and Shuri marvels at it as the pedals of the
pyramid open and the sun rises from it

NAMOR (CONTD)
It is called the Sastun We use it
for our rituals

NAMOR

Yes In the depths of the ocean I

A CLANKING SOUND echoes through the room intermittently

Ross clocks the video cameras mounted on the walls - manages
to maneuver it their blindspots by constantly shifting his
position He speaks with his BRITISH ACCENT throughout

It took us some doing but the team
was able to crack the thumb drive
overnight no problem

Camera finds a COMPUTER TECHNICIAN removing a thumb drive
from an evidence bin But where’s Riri’s laptop

ROSS
Thank you Ms Davidson

NSA LIASION
Please call me Debbie

Well Debbie the information on

the key to finding the “Spymaster”
Having Harmon Taylor loose on US
soil isn’t good for either of our

Is it true that he’s never been
caught

ROSS
(scanning the room)
Not yet

There it is A LEAD COMPUTER TECHNICIAN sits at the far side
of the room at work table in the middle of the room where we
reveal RIRI’S TOUGHBOOK hooked up to several wires

Ross leans on the table but has to angle away from a camera
so is VERY CLOSE to the Tech The CLANKING SOUND continues

Why

ROSS
Because we don’t have any real
justification for it It wasn’t
them in the Atlantic Weve
recovered no evidence

How do you explain Boston then
They abducted the young woman who
built the machine

ROSS

With all due respect Riri Williams
is a child prodigy who was running
circles around every professor at
MIT The Wakandans were there to
recruit her for their outreach
programs and you guys sent a SWAT
TEAM under the cover of night to
arrest the crown princess of an

was going to happen

create a violent chemical reaction
that converts the air around it to
