Dialogue in bold italics to be spoken in Thai and sub-titled

EXT FOOTBALL PITCH - BAN CHONG THAILAND - DAY 1
DAY 1 - Saturday June 23

A thick mist hangs over Nang Non mountain a curtain of dark
green tropical vegetation DOWN TO FIND a football pitch
where the under-15 team of local club the Wild Boars are
having a kick-around for practice under the eye of their
young COACH 25

The tallest boy in the team gangling LEK has the ball at
his feet and is racing for the goal The smallest boy in the
team his friend little CHAI is on his heels trying to
tackle him weaving in and out constantly out-played

ARM the team captain urges Chai on

ARM
Go Chai Go Chai

PREM the team clown can’t stop laughing at the sight of
little Chai trying to tackle big Lek Lek slams the ball

between the goal posts He does a victory dance like his

hero football star Ronaldo

Coach blows his whistle The boys race to the side of the
pitch where there’s a cart selling grilled pork skewers
They’re hungry and they jostle to get the food

CHAI
Here comes Messi greatest player
in the world

He clenches his fists and does the Messi shoulder shake Prem
finds this hilarious

PREM
Messi My hero Let me touch your
golden boots

Arm comes up to Prem holding a bag -

ARM
Hey birthday boy Today’s your
day

PREM

You’re all invited to my party

ARM
But first -
THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 2

He takes a flashlight from his bag and shines it in Prem’s
face

ARM
Guess where we’re going

He shines the flashlight round the other boys They let out a
cheer and race for their bikes Lek stays back with Coach

LEK
My dad’s cooking for the party I
promised I’d help

COACH
I’d better go with them See you at
the party

Coach goes after the boys as they jump on their bikes and
cycle away up the track

Lek mounts his bike and pedals off in the opposite direction
back into town

EXT MAIN ROAD - DAY 2

Twelve boys and their coach a column of bicycles pedal up
the dirt track shouting to each other as they go The track
runs through rice fields where FARMERS are out tending their
crops

EXT THAM LUANG - CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY 3
The mountain is close now looming overhead

The boys dismount just before the mouth of the cave and push
their bikes They pass a small shrine where candles burn
before a statue of a reclining woman a goddess decorated
with garlands of flowers They put their hands together and
make a quick token bow as they go by and push their bikes on
to the cave Prem forgets to pay his respects and turns back
for a hurried bow

Coach bringing up the rear also bows to the goddess but he
does so more intently than the boys
INT THAM LUANG - CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY 4

The boys wheel their bikes into the wide entrance to the dark
cave and lean them against the long railing
THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 3

INT CHAMBER 1 - DAY 5

The boys head off in a laughing chattering band across the
immense cave entrance and into the wide tunnel on the far
side that leads to the inner chambers They race through it
their flashlight beams dancing on the rock walls

INT CHAMBER 3 - DAY 6

The boys come out of the tunnel into a broad chamber where a
little water has pooled onto its floor They splash each
other as they race across their flashlight beams reaching
ahead to the next tunnel Some of the boys kick off their
shoes Those still carrying rucksacks drop them off on the
wide rock shelf

INT STALACTITE TUNNEL - DAY 7

In the juddering flashlights we see Chai clambering down a
narrow sloping tunnel into a tight squeeze He stops looking
round not sure if the boys are going further

Arm shines his flashlight on Chai’s face

ARM
You scared

CHAI
No way Let’s go

He pushes on into the tunnel The others give a whoop and
follow

THE CAMERA STAYS as the tunnel empties and the sounds of the
boys fade to silence Then all we hear is the trickle of the
water flowing in from the right-hand tunnel and the water

seeping steadily down the walls to pool on the chamber floor

SCENE DELETED 8

EXT MAE SAI THAILAND - NIGHT 9

Rain Rain soaking down on the tropical forest round the
town Rain making puddles on the paths between the houses
Rain on the roofs and streaming down the narrow streets

A small motorbike comes put-putting through the rain Its
rider is Chai’s 35-year-old mother BUAHOM well-wrapped
against the rain She weaves her way through the town
splashing in and out of puddles

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 4

INT FAMILY HOUSE - MAE SAI - NIGHT 10

Rain falling outside the windows Buahom comes in shaking
off the rain She looks nervous she’s not a regular part of
this group

birthday boy Prem is on his phone His wife WANNA another
father SOMBOON and YOD and KAMPANG father and mother of

paying any attention to Buahom

THIRTEEN LIVES GOLDENROD REVISIONS 25921 Pg 5

MANOP

Looks like they went to the cave
Me too

He ends his phone call Buahom looks at the rain streaming
down outside and starts to worry

BUAHOM

get them They’1ll get soaked biking
back

SOMBOON

sense as chickens

EXT MAE SAI - NIGHT 10A

Rain streams down on the market area of town In the cars

running a news bulletin

The people in the car react to the radio speaking on top of
the newsreader -

BUAHOM
Monsoon

CAR RADIO
Six weeks earlier than expected -

SOMBOON
It can’t be the moonsoon

LEK

EXT THAM LUANG TRACK - NIGHT 11

Rain streaming down as the day ends Two cars jolt their way
up the track where the boys cycled In the cars Manop
Wanna Somboon Yod Kampang Buahom and Lek

EXT THAM LUANG - CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 12

Rain is already turning the track to mud as the cars pull up
by the Parks Building Lights are on and PARK RANGERS are
moving between the building and the entrance to the cave

The six parents and Lek get out of the cars pulling hoods
over their head against the rain and go to the cave

INT THAM LUANG - CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 13

The parents see the line of bikes leaning against the
railings Buahom identifies Chai’s bike with a cry

BUAHOM
That’s Chai’s bike

Deeper inside the dark cave she sees men training the beams
of their flashlights on rising water The sound of rushing
water everywhere

KITTIPONG SAISOR a veteran park ranger comes over to them
He’s carrying a powerful flashlight

MANOP
Where are the boys
THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 6

SAISOR
We’ve been in as far as we could
go The cave’s flooding We’ve put
out an emergency call

SOMBOON
(to Manop)
Let’s go in and get them

He and Manop head for the tunnel but Saisor blocks their way

SAISOR
The cave’s closed Look It’s
flooding

BUAHOM

How can the cave be closed How are
they to come out

She starts to shout for her son -

BUAHOM
Chai Chai Can you hear me

14 EXT GOVERNOR’S HOUSE - CHIANG RAI - NIGHT 14

Rain falling A car and driver stands waiting engine
running as GOVERNOR NARONGSAK comes out of his house
pulling up his coat’s hood against the rain His female
assistant PREEYA is by the car

NARONGSAK
I’d just started my dinner

PREEYA
Sorry Governor

The Governor gets into the back of the car Preeya gets in
the front by the driver The car pulls away

15 INTEXT CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 15

NARONGSAK
Strictly speaking none of this is
my responsibility now You know
what my next job is

PREEYA

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 7

NARONGSAK
Nor do I The Minister hasn’t been
kind enough to tell me yet So what
is this Some kids stuck in a cave

PREEYA
Yes sir A youth football team

NARONGSAK
Football team They play football
in caves Look at this rain How
far is this cave

PREEYA
About an hour and a half sir

The Governor sighs

NARONGSAK
And no dinner

EXT CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 16

The mountain looms in the darkness beneath the night sky
DOWN to see the headlights of cars and trucks sweeping
towards the cave People hurrying back and forth in the rain-
drenched night

Two buses drive in Out of the buses streams a platoon of
NAVY SEALS led by their commander CAPTAIN ARNONT SUREEWONG
40 slight in build close-cropped hair glasses an
intellectual-looking military man As his men unpack their
diving gear the Governor’s car arrives Narongsak and Preeya
get out They see the Navy Seals getting ready to enter the
cave

NARONGSAK
Who called in the Navy

He goes over to the Seals and speaks to Captain Arnont

NARONGSAK
I’m the Governor of the province
You are

CAPTAIN ARNONT
Captain Arnont Sureewong sir Navy
Seals

His attention is on his men and he barely glances at the
Governor
THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 8

NARONGSAK
Brief me please

CAPTAIN ARNONT
The cave is flooded My men will
enter with breathing apparatus
It’s all under control

Preeya joins the Governor with a lean Englishman who’s just
arrived VERN UNSWORTH 60

PREEYA
This man lives near by sir He
knows the cave

VERN UNSWORTH
I’ve mapped it All of it

He’s pulling out a hand-drawn map The Governor studies it by
the light of his phone

VERN UNSWORTH
I’ve never been in when it’s
flooded - that’s a whole different
game You have to be a bit -

He makes a gesture meaning ‘crazy’

VERN UNSWORTH
There’s some pretty tight corners
in there real squeeze But there’s
some big chambers too The boys
should be okay so long as we get
them out soon

Captain Arnont is now also looking at Vern’s map

CAPTAIN ARNONT
Let me show this to my men

Narongsak nods Vern and Captain Arnont go into a huddle over
the map with the Navy Seals The Governor finds himself
effectively left out as the professionals get into the
details

PREEYA
Maybe I could find you something to
eat sir

NARONGSAK
That would be kind This could be a
long night

18A

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 9

INT CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 17

Buahom and the other parents look on as a powerful light is
dragged into the cave It comes on dazzling everyone Its
light illuminates the great space so that we see it clearly
for the first time From the railing where the parents stand
and the bikes are parked a rock face slopes steeply down to
an immense void bigger than a football arena with
stalactites stabbing down from the high rock roof like
monster’s teeth At the far end a lake has formed into which
water is flowing from a wide rock tunnel The light gleams on
the water bouncing patterns onto the tunnel roof

The team of Navy Seals now enter the cave ready to dive
wearing head-torches Their leader LIEUTENANT KIET a super-
fit 25-year-old leads them across the wide entrance As they
reach the tunnel he pulls out a phone holds it up for a
group selfie His group includes a medic DR KARN and two
young eager Seals JAY and PICHAI

KIET
Navy Seals We don’t go home till
we’ve got the kids Hooyah

His comrades punch the air and echo their trademark cry

NAVY SEALS
Hooyah

INT CHAMBER 1 - NIGHT 18
DAY 2 - Sunday June 24 (midnight)

The Seals splash through shallow water down the wide tunnel
The terrain rises and falls and is strewn with boulders
Their head-torches throw beams of light onto the craggy roof
and walls The sound of gushing water fills the air

INT U-BEND - NIGHT 18A

The Navy Seals stride across U-Bend to the point where the
next tunnel is almost completely filled with water Here the
diving begins

Kiet looks round his men fixes his mask They all follow
suit He gives them a thumbs-up and submerges himself under
the murky water One by one his men follow him and they’re
gone

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 10

EXT MOUNTAIN - NIGHT 19

The rain falls ceaselessly Lightning lights up the long low
mountain

EXT THAM LUANG - BASECAMP - NIGHT 20

More and more cars arriving A local TV news crew is setting
up camera and lights

The huddle of parents stands by the cave entrance patiently
waiting for the Navy Seals to return with their boys They’re
anxious but still able to exchange chatter and even some
nervy laughter Captain Arnont waits staring towards the
cave

EXT THAM LUANG - BASECAMP - LATER - NIGHT 21

Governor Narongsak speaking to a TV news crew in the rain
He’s keen to communicate his confidence that everything’s
under control

NARONGSAK
It’s a deep cave several
kilometers long It’s got some
tricky narrow passages If the boys
have gone a long way in it could
be a few more hours I have every
confidence in the Navy Seals They
know what they’re doing

INT CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 22

Flickers of light from deep in the tunnel The lights grow
brighter

Then they appear moving slowly exhausted and in pain Kiet
and his team of Navy Seals wading their way through the water
back towards the cave mouth One of the Seals is being
supported by comrades Another has a cut on his brow that’s
bleeding

Captain Arnont Governor Narongsak and Preeya - a huddle of
parents Buahom a little apart by the railing - all staring
in shock

The Navy Seals come to a stop and pull off their masks and
meet the stunned gaze of all the people waiting in the cave
Kiet shakes his head

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 11

Buahom gives a gasping sob Governor Narongsak and Captain
Arnont share a look what now

INT RICK STANTON’S HOUSE - COVENTRY ENGLAND - DAY 23
DAY 3 - Monday June 25

Lean crop-headed RICK STANTON 57 is bent over a worktop
covered in tools constructing a home-made re-breather part
of his diving kit All round him the clutter of a man who
lives alone his life given over to his hobbies which are
cave diving and kayaking Bottles of oxygen diving
apparatus kayaks under repair compete for space with a
couch a TV and the remains of takeaway meals

The rain streams down

A shelter has been erected across from the cave entrance and
here the PARENTS of the boys are huddled on plastic chairs
trying to sleep as the rain streams down Lek lies curled up
asleep on the ground Buahom can’t sleep She sits apart from
the others gazing towards the bright light spilling from the
cave

Park Ranger Saisor comes to the families camp carrying half a
dozen clear plastic bags He lays them out on a table The
parents gather round

SAISOR
We found these when we went in on
the first night

The parents look more closely Then they start to recognize
items and to retrieve them a pair of black sneakers many
pairs of slip-on sandals half a dozen backpacks Buahom
finds her son’s sandals

Great trucks are now pulling into the muddy space by the
cave Teams of WATER ENGINEERS move GIANT PUMPS into
position and lay lines of giant hose Among them a big
cheerful water engineer called UDOM

Engines start to rumble and the water starts to flow through
the hoses in torrents and gush out into open ground More
news crews are arriving and setting up their cameras

A convoy of official cars pulls in to the muddy rain-drenched
site Buahom follows the cars’ arrival as if they might be
bringing a savior Governor Narongsak and Preeya head for the
cars to greet the VIP As they go the Governor’s attention
is caught by a slight boyish ginger-haired figure THANET

EXT MOUNTAIN VILLAGE - DAY
DAY 6 - Thursday June 28

Rain streams down over the roofs of this little cluster of
houses at the foot of the mountain In the shelter of a
doorway Thanet Natisri is deep in talk with the VILLAGE
HEADMAN a wiry old man Thanet is gesturing towards the
mountain above

THANET NATISRI
They tell me you’re the guy who
knows this mountain best

VILLAGE HEADMAN
Sure I know the mountain

THANET NATISRI
You know the cave is flooded There
are boys trapped in there Even the

engineer from Bangkok I can really
help here

VILLAGE HEADMAN

THANET NATISRI
No I just came like everyone else
here There’s no time for all that
official permission stuff

He gestures up at the rain streaming down on the mountain

THANET NATISRI
The rain water is flooding the
cave It’s coming from above not
below We have to stop it getting
in I need to find all the
sinkholes block them and get the
water off the mountain

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY 32

The village Headman makes his way up the mountain at such
speed despite his age that Thanet finds it hard to keep up
Thanet stops to catch his breath and look down Far below
there are rice fields The Headman hasn’t paused for breath
Thanet pushes on after him through the undergrowth following
a mountain stream And suddenly - the stream is gone

Thanet stands back taking out his iPad to photograph the
cleft in the rocks where the stream is draining away as if
down a giant plug hole

EXT CHIANG RAI AIRPORT - DAY 33

powerfully-built man with a cheery face On the TV he sees
General Anupong flanked by Captain Arnont

GENERAL ANUPONG
A team of Navy Seals is standing by
as soon as conditions permit to go
into the cave and bring out the
boys That means waiting for the
rain to ease off

John Volanthen comes into the luggage area talking on his
phone as he waits for his luggage He’s wearing a
‘Spartathlon’ T-shirt Saman notes him

JOHN VOLANTHEN

THIRTEEN LIVES YELLOW REVISIONS 29321 Pg 18

JOHN VOLANTHEN (cont)

system goes down they think
they’ve been zapped by the Death
Star

He sees one of his bags appear

JOHN VOLANTHEN
(to phone)
Here’s my bags Have to go Barry
Good luck

Saman watching sees that John’s luggage includes diving
gear and he becomes interested

Rick Stanton comes shambling into the luggage area looking
like a tourist on a day trip He’s checking something on his
phone John offers him a custard cream from his packet

RICK STANTON
Long way to come for nothing That
cave’s been hit by a flash flood
Those kids aren’t coming out

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Did you bring your inner tube

RICK STANTON
Of course Why wouldn’t I

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Because it makes you look like a
cock womble

RICK STANTON
You’re the one with the Fartathlon
t-shirt

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Spartathlon

Rick and John now have their gear on a trolley As they pass
Saman on their way out he looks curiously at their diving
gear An officer from the Tourist Police POLICE CAPTAIN BAS
greets them and leads them out Saman turns his gaze back to
the TV

survive long enough for us to get
to them

EXT THAM LUANG - NIGHT 35

The Tourist Police minibus drives into Tham Luang Rain

RICK STANTON

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Seriously I don’t care about

I’m disappointed But that’s okay

They shoulder their gear and prepare to follow Bas As they
cross the site they take in for the first time the huge
crowded tent-town that’s grown up round the cave

RICK STANTON
Bloody hell

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Who are all these people

BAS

the Governor their names

CAPTAIN ARNONT
The Governor sent for them
THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 22

KIET
They’re amateurs Look at them
They’1l never survive the currents
in the cave

CAPTAIN ARNONT
(to Vern)
Why did the Governor send for them

VERN UNSWORTH
They’ve done cave rescues all over
the world

JOHN VOLANTHEN
We have to be on some list
somewhere

VERN UNSWORTH
(to Arnont)
I told the Governor these are the
guys you need

Captain Arnont stares at Rick and John unconvinced

VERN UNSWORTH
(to Rick and John)
Sorry about this guys It’s just
that nobody wants foreigners dying
in the cave Doesn’t look good

RICK STANTON
We won’t die I have zero interest
in dying How about you John

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Same

Captain Arnont gives a shrug

CAPTAIN ARNONT
The Governor sent for them It’s
his responsibility
(to Rick and John)
Very well Dive

Rick and John give a nod and head to the water Kiet watches
them go shaking his head
INT CHAMBER 1 - NIGHT 39

Rick and John stride into the tunnel through the gushing
water Lights have been fixed in this tunnel

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 23

RICK STANTON
Jesus Looks like a bloody circus

INT CHAMBER 3 - NIGHT 40

Rick wades into a partially flooded chamber the water racing
all round him John emerges by his side They turn their
heads taking in where they’ve arrived There are three
PUMPING ENGINEERS scrambling to get out before it’s too late

Rick and John carry on now wading in neck deep water

INT U-BEND CHAMBER —- NIGHT 41

Rick and John water still up to their necks passing yet
another worker Udom who is struggling to right a faulty
pump before he leaves shivering in the cold Rick and John
working round the U-bend against the surging water Until
they reach a point where they have to dive

INT UNDERWATER - STALACTITE TUNNEL - NIGHT 42

DIVERS POV - The blur of rock walls as they loom out of the
murk Rapid turns to avoid contact Bare hands feeling their
way The light of a head-torch revealing high crags and
sudden drops into nothing Glimpses of hosepipes clustered on
the rock floor Short stretches of rope fixed to the side
then ending All seen through a constantly surging churn of
tea-colored water that carries debris along with it

They skillfully negotiate a pinch-point The sound of the
divers’ steady breathing The trail of bubbles from their
masks

INT T-JUNCTION - NIGHT 43

DIVER POV - Rick’s glimpse of John following behind - back
and round to see a water surface above - and up to break the
surface the head-torch beaming up into open space -

Rick and John surface and struggle to keep from being swept
back They look round to get their bearings fighting all the
time against the current The water pours in torrents out of
the channel A sign pointing left saying PATTAYA BEACH is
half covered

They submerge again thrash against the water attempting to
enter the next tunnel Then they’re above water again
looking round to find they’ve got nowhere

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 24

Suddenly a massive surge of water roars into the chamber
slamming them both back against the rock walls

Rick makes a throat-cutting gesture to John and John nods
They turn back the way they came and submerge

INT U-BEND CHAMBER —- NIGHT 44

Rick and John re-surface in U-Bend chamber racing the rising
water There’s Udom frantically waving to them

UDOM
I can’t get out

RICK STANTON
What’s he doing here

They wade over to Udom

UDOM
The water came too fast I was
working fixing the pump -

RICK STANTON
You speak English

He mimes swimming

RICK STANTON
You can swim

Udom nods eagerly

RICK STANTON
John Give me your mask I’1l take
him out and come back

John takes off his mask and oxygen cylinder Rick fits it on
Udom He puts his arm round him

RICK STANTON
When we’re in the water I guide
you okay Do not try to swim ahead
of me or away from me Stay very
close

John fits the regulator of the breathing apparatus into
Udom’s mouth Rick and Udom plunge into the swirling rising
water

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 25

INT UNDERWATER - NIGHT 45

RICKS POV - Rick holds Udom close watching to see that his
breathing is working as they push through the murky water

The powerful current drives them along rapidly and Rick has
to keep reaching out to fend off rock promontories He sees

Udom’s eyes through the mask and he looks panicked

They dive down are swept along For a few moments they
hurtle down the flooded tunnel turning and turning All the
way Rick keeps close hold of Udom as they swoop over the
sudden drops and evade the projecting rocks Then they’re
heading up again and there’s light above

Udom realizes the surface is above him and suddenly panics
desperate to get to air He kicks and claws the water Rick
struggles to hold him back but he thrashes away from him
almost knocking Rick’s mask from his face His own mask comes
loose he starts gulping water Rick drags him upwards -

INT CHAMBER 3 - NIGHT 46

Udom surfaces choking disoriented terrified Rick surfaces
beside him pulling him in the right direction As soon as
they’re standing waist deep Rick strips the mask from him
Three other PUMPING ENGINEERS see them Rick waits just long
enough to see that Udom is being helped on his way then he
dives back down into the water

Aided now by his companions Udom sets off walking unsteadily
through the waist-deep water to the bright lights of the cave
entrance

INT U-BEND CHAMBER —- NIGHT 47

Rick is back in U-Bend chamber John is re-fitting his
returned cylinder and mask Rick shaking his head at the
craziness

RICK STANTON
That was exciting

JOHN VOLANTHEN
We better get out of here You
ready

RICK STANTON
Yeah I’m ready
(looking round)
You know what This cave has my
attention
THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 26

48 INT CHAMBER 1 - NIGHT 48

The scene in the cave entrance is chaotic as the water level
rises and men and equipment are being pulled out

Governor Narongsak Preeya Captain Arnont Kiet and Vern
stand waiting

NARONGSAK
Who let them dive

CAPTAIN ARNONT
You sent for them sir

NARONGSAK
I’ve sent for a lot of people

Now they see Rick and John come wading out of the cave
pulling off their masks Not what the Governor expected

NARONGSAK
These are the elite divers

KIET
They haven’t found the boys

Rick and John reach the waiting group visibly exhausted

NARONGSAK
I am the Governor of this province
We’re grateful for your help

RICK STANTON
We went as far as we could Didn’t
find the boys

JOHN VOLANTHEN
(to Vern)
You were right It’s bad in there

RICK STANTON
We got your guy out

NARONGSAK
What guy

JOHN VOLANTHEN
He was handling pumps He got
trapped

He looks round to see if he can see him The Governor turns
to Captain Arnont
THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 27

NARONGSAK
You know about this

CAPTAIN ARNONT
No sir
(to Rick and John)
How far did you get

RICK STANTON
The T-junction We’1ll go further
next time

CAPTAIN ARNONT
(to the Governor)
They’ve not done any better than my
men

NARONGSAK
(to Arnont)
I sent for them on good advice I’m
pursuing every avenue open to me

CAPTAIN ARNONT
Yes Governor
(beat)
I’1l let you know when the rescue
operation can be resumed

He and Kiet walk away

NARONGSAK
(to Rick and John)
I must ask you to wait to dive
again until conditions improve

Turning to his entourage -

NARONGSAK
Have they been allocated hotel
accommodation Who’s looking after
our guests

Preeya gives Police Captain Bas a nod and he steps forward

NARONGSAK
I’m sure you would like to rest
now This officer will look after
everything Please do not attempt
to enter the cave again without my
permission

EXT CAVE ENTRANCEDIVERS CAMP - NIGHT

Pg 28

Rick and John and Vern Unsworth have just come out of the
cave with Police Captain Bas A pick-up is waiting near the

shrine

JOHN VOLANTHEN
What was all that about

VERN UNSWORTH

In theory the Governor’s in charge
but Captain Arnont’s the Navy chief
on the ground and he doesn’t take
orders from civilians Plus the
rumor is the Governor’s been
sacked This was supposed to be his
last week here Now he’s been
ordered to stay on

Rick gives a nod at the statue of the goddess Buahom is

there placing an offering before the shrine

RICK STANTON
What’s that

VERN UNSWORTH
It’s a shrine to Princess Nang Non
The Sleeping Princess

Police Captain Bas points to the mountain above

BAS
This is her mountain Nang Non
mountain

VERN UNSWORTH
When you see it from a distance
it’s supposed to look like a
Sleeping Princess

BAS
They say her tears trap the boys
that the Sleeping Princess is
angry

RICK STANTON
Angry What’s she angry about

BAS
I don’t know It’s just what the
local people say

Rick stares at the mountain It’s like he’s checking out an

opponent in a contest

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 29

Bas starts to load their gear into the back of the pick-up
John checks out the new form of transport

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Looks like we’ve been downgraded

BAS
Sorry about that The minibus is
only used for airport pick ups

EXT RESORT HOTEL - NIGHT 50

pulls off the road into this modest chalet resort The rain
still pouring down Rick and John get out humping their
backpacks Bas jumps out to guide them to their quarters

INT CHALET - RESORT HOTEL - NIGHT 51

Bas opens the door into a chalet bedroom and Rick and John
enter The rain is loud on the corrugated iron roof They
pull off their wet outer coats as they check out their
accommodation There’s just the one double bed

JOHN VOLANTHEN
One bed

BAS
Big bed

RICK STANTON
Yeah Okay Thanks

BAS
I’1l come for you in the morning

He leaves them Rick goes to the room’s patio windows and
opens them Outside there’s a small veranda Rick looks out
at the streaming rain

Johns studying a map of the cave He takes out his packet of
custard creams and eats one not offering any to Rick He
replaces the packet in his rucksack Rick comes in His eyes
on John’s rucksack

JOHN VOLANTHEN

RICK STANTON
Just one

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 30

JOHN VOLANTHEN
No And I’ve counted them

He pulls back the covers on the bed

Saman waves back and gives the Seal cry punching the air

SAMAN

He walks over to join them looking to Captain Arnont with a
hopeful smile

THIRTEEN LIVES GREEN REVISIONS 29421 Pg 31

SAMAN
I got tired of watching you on TV

CAPTAIN ARNONT
Good to see you brother

He introduces Saman to Kiet and the other Seals

CAPTAIN ARNONT
Saman served under me for ten
years We chased pirates together
He was one of our best

SAMAN
I’m only in Chiang Rai It’s so
near I couldn’t just sit there

He claps his hands to call the meeting to order

NARONGSAK
Thank you everyone Okay

He refers to a map of the cave explaining partly to the
newly arrived Americans

NARONGSAK
We think the boys were heading for
here They call it Pattaya Beach
Seven days ago now So far with
the high water levels the low
visibility and just the difficulty
of the cave itself none of our
divers have been able to reach
them So - when do we go back in
And who goes back in

RICK STANTON
Send us in again We’1ll make it

NARONGSAK
You think you can go further into
the cave than trained Navy divers

RICK STANTON
Yes

Kiet meets Captain Arnont’s eyes with a shrug of irritation
John sees this

JOHN VOLANTHEN
No offense but your divers aren’t
trained for this No one is Rick
and me have been doing this for
twenty years

VERN UNSWORTH
You have to have a certain kind of
mindset for deep cave diving

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 33

VERN UNSWORTH (cont)
Very focussed Very methodical
Like a machine

CAPTAIN ARNONT
You’re machines

RICK STANTON
You got anything against machines

KIET
(Low)
Only old machines

The other Seals laugh Rick can see that they’re laughing at
him and he doesn’t like it

Captain Arnont speaks effectively taking charge

CAPTAIN ARNONT
So here’s the situation We need
the rain to stop Let the pumps do
their work Then we go in

RICK STANTON
We can go in now

A direct challenge Arnont meets Rick’s stare

CAPTAIN ARNONT
I’m responsible for my men We will
wait for the conditions to improve
As for anyone else that’s for the
Governor to decide

He turns to the Governor The Governor makes a holding
decision

NARONGSAK
For now nobody goes in We wait
for the rain to stop

EXT BASECAMP - DAY 55

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Things change

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 34

RICK STANTON
Give me one reason why we should
stay

JOHN VOLANTHEN
How about thirteen reasons

RICK STANTON
That’s not our kids in the cave
It’s their kids We don’t belong
here

JOHN VOLANTHEN
So how come the whole world’s
watching It’s different with kids
It’s like kids belong to everyone

RICK STANTON
Speak for yourself

Rain pouring down over the trees In the distance on a high
ridge a HEAVY-DUTY DRILL is grinding its way into the rock

A convoy of SUVs bumps up the mountain track Governor
Narongsak and his entourage are on a tour of inspection of
the teams at work The convoy reaches a clearing where Thanet
Natisri is directing a team of men diverting a stream The
village Headman is with him

Governor Narongsak gets out of his car to join them He looks
round at the unexpected scale of the activity and at Thanet

PREEYA
Seems like he just showed up on his
own initiative sir I’ve checked
him out He’s on the Bangkok
Aquifer Recovery Project

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 35

PREEYA (cont)
The men working with him are local
villagers

The Governor goes over to Thanet

NARONGSAK
I don’t believe we’ve met I’m the
Governor here

Thanet responds in Americanized English

THANET NATISRI
I’m the water guy

NARONGSAK
You’re American

Thanet reverts to speaking Thai

THANET NATISRI
I live in Illinois but I’m from
Bangkok I was in Bangkok when I
heard the news I came on over and
rounded up some volunteers and
here we are

NARONGSAK
Doing what exactly

THANET NATISRI
There’s a network of mountain
feeder streams that carries water
through all the fissures and cracks
in the rock into the cave That’s
what’s creating the strong
currents If we can find enough of
the streams and divert them the
water level in the cave will drop

NARONGSAK
I thought that’s why we’re pumping
the water out of the cave below

THANET NATISRI
No sir All those big pumps in the
cave are useless All the time
you’re sucking the water out from
the bottom it’s going in at the
top

NARONGSAK
And you can stop that

THIRTEEN LIVES SALMON REVISIONS 15521 Pg 36

THANET NATISRI
We can try But there is a price to

Pay

EXT HUT PADDY FIELDS - DAY 57

A group of local FARMERS have gathered in the shelter of an
open-fronted hut to listen to the village Headman Thanet
Natisri and Governor Narongsak stand back watching

VILLAGE HEADMAN
You’ve all been in the cave You
know how the water comes in from
the mountain above Now they want
to send the water a different way
down the side of the mountain That
way the water doesn’t go into the
cave It comes here Onto your
fields

The farmers hear this in silence The female farmer Mae Noi
speaks up

MAE NOI
The water will damage our crop

VILLAGE HEADMAN
Yes

MAE NOI
We will lose our crop

VILLAGE HEADMAN

Yes

MAE NOI
How long have the boys been in the
cave

THANET NATISRI
Eight days so far

Mae Noi speaks in a low murmur to the other farmers Then
back to Thanet -

MAE NOI
This will save their lives

THANET NATISRI
I can’t promise that But it gives
them a chance

Just wondering

Rick’s looking at the outline of the distant mountain

RICK STANTON

track through the dark water until they feel ground beneath
their feet Their heads emerge once more

The beams of their head-torches sweep over the water’s
surface - over dripping rock walls - to land on -

GAUNT FACES - staring back in shock high up on a slope

RICK STANTON
Theyre alive

JOHN VOLANTHEN

the joker little Chai Coach - all thin-faced from hunger
but very much alive

John is transformed almost elated Rick hangs back He
doesn’t want to get too close to the boys

slithering down the muddy slope towards him He comes to a
stop staring into the flashlight

CAPTAIN ARNONT
This is the hardest section

JOHN VOLANTHEN
This and the squeeze between
Chambers 3 and 4

RICK STANTON
We tied the line into the roof
there so you’1ll have to be at full

flood All of it They won’t
survive that

hasn’t been asked already And
maybe Chris Jewell You think Chris
is up to it

more Navy Seals are getting into the water laden with oxygen
cylinders Saman hauls his bag of wet suits He’s determined
to show he can keep up with the younger guys

INT UNDERWATER —- U-BEND - DAY 112

Through the brown water glimpses of the Navy Seals as they
struggle to tug the hose through the flooded cave The hose
snags on rocks stretches and resists The sheer friction
against the rough rock sides makes it impossible to pull the
hose through

Saman swims underwater with the bag of wet suits It’s
buoyant and resists forcing him to put constant extra effort
into dragging it after him

INT U-BEND CHAMBER —- DAY 113

Two Navy Seals surface and stack the extra oxygen cylinders
they carry on the shelf of rock above the water line

his bag of wet suits The third Seal surfaces and gestures to
his companions that he’1ll go on to the next chamber Saman
sees him go and follows

current dragging his load of wet suits It’s tough work and
now he’s breathing rapidly As he feels his way round the
twists and turns of the tunnel his regulator tube hooks on a
stalactite air comes bubbling out He reaches for it and
finds himself trapped in the narrow space

A glimpse of his face contorted with lack of air struggling
with his air feed Panic on his face He lets go of the heavy
bag and turns to swim back
THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 77

The Seal who has gone ahead looks back and sees Saman

THIRTEEN LIVES FULL PINK REVISIONS 19321 Pg 80

After a few moments -

HARRY
I just heard my dad’s been taken
into hospital Some kind of check-
up His heart’s never been great

RICK STANTON
I’m sorry

HARRY
He’s tough He’s made it to eighty-
eight

A moment of silence Rick says nothing guessing at the
process going on in Harry Then -

HARRY
If we had enough back-up - maybe -
just maybe - one or two or three
of those kids - just might make it
through You’re talking five hours
They’d have to have top-up shots
along the way And you’ve got the
saliva problem Don’t want them
choking Christ mate I don’t even
know why I’m saying this It’s
insanity

RICK STANTON
Because a man’s already died
Because those kids don’t have much

time left

HARRY
You want to have a kid die in your
arms

RICK STANTON
I don’t want any of this I get
asked to do rescue work I do it

Silence again

RICK STANTON
Come on Harry What choice do we
have We do nothing we’ll be
bringing them out dead for sure
This way if they die while we’re
bringing them out - at least we’ll
have tried

He waits And Harry gets there

HARRY
Okay But they’1ll never buy it

INT WAR ROOM - PARKS BUILDING - BASECAMP - DAY

NARONGSAK
Sedated How sedated

HARRY
Fully unconscious

JOHN VOLANTHEN
It’s the only way we can dive them
out

RICK STANTON
They have to be motionless Totally
inert We take them like parcels

NARONGSAK
(to Harry)
You’re an anesthetist
HARRY
Yes
NARONGSAK

How safe is this procedure

HARRY
I can’t answer that I’ve never
done it before Nobody has We’re
talking about administering
anesthetics under conditions where
we can’t monitor the effects Too
much and respiration shuts down
Too little and they wake under
water and - and they drown

NARONGSAK
So you expect casualties

HARRY
Yes I expect casualties

The divers clamber out onto the shelf They haul up their
loads and start to unpack them

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Today’s the day We’re taking you
out We can take four

KIET

They are taking us out today But
they can only take four

The boys cheer again John pulls out the bundle of bracelets -
he’s brought them after all - and hands them to Coach

JOHN VOLANTHEN

As Coach hands out the bracelets to the boys Harry sits down
to brief Dr Karn

HARRY
Dr Karn I’m a medic You need to
know what we’re proposing here

eyes John holds up his wrist There’s his bracelet

We see Dr Karn’s eyebrows shoot up as he learns the plan from
Harry

Who’s going first
The boys look at each other No one wants to be first

KIET
Coach you must choose

Coach thinks for a moment

COACH
Chai Arm Aat Poom Chai you go

Chai hurries joyfully forward John studies him
JOHN VOLANTHEN
Not sure we’ve got a mask that’1l

fit you

He tries on the smallest mask they have Harry checks it with
him

HARRY
No way

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Well get you a better mask

DR KARN
They have to find a mask to fit
you

CHAI

DR KARN
I think they have to bring it

Chai’s face falls He moves back up the slope to allow others
to come forward

COACH
Decha You go

Decha comes forward Jason picks him out a wet suit and hands
it to him

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Jason

Jason nods

JASON MALLINSON
Yeah Ill go first

Harry prepares the drugs Chris picks out a mask to fit
Decha When Decha has his wet suit on Dr Karn gives him a
tablet and the boy swallows it Everything proceeds in a
careful silence each person focussed on their task Jason
gets fully geared up to go

THIRTEEN LIVES YELLOW REVISIONS 29321 Pg 89

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Everyone else up to the top of the
slope
(whispers to Kiet)
Don’t let them watch

Kiet relays the instruction and the boys and the Seals all
shuffle up the slope to the back John speaks low to the
others -

JOHN VOLANTHEN
No need to scare them with the needles

Chris guides Decha now getting woozy onto Harry’s lap
Harry his syringe ready finds a spot on his leg He speaks
soothingly to the boy as he works

HARRY
Youve got Jason taking you out
He’s a star Just look up there at
the roof Are you a fan of the
World Cup Brazil’s out That was a
surprise

He injects him with ketamine Very quickly Decha is
unconscious Working with speed the others then assist in
fitting the hood packing it with foam placing the mask on
his face and checking the seal attaching the gas bottle with
bungee ropes to his body and tying his wrists and ankles

Then Harry and Chris lower the unconscious boy into the
water dip his head under to test that the mask is working
For a long moment nothing happens Then they see bubbles
coming out They look into his face They exchange nods it’s
good

Jason completes his own checks Then the others help him take
the unconscious boy in his arms He holds him close to his
chest with his face towards him so he can check his
breathing and swims out into the deep water Then as the
others look on he dives

INT UNDERWATER - CHAMBER 9 TUNNEL - DAY 141

Jason keeps one arm round Decha the other on the line as he
swims and pulls his way down the twisting tunnel He keeps
checking to see that the boy is breathing He uses his own
body as a buffer to make sure the boy never hits the rock
sides This cradling method of carrying the boys looks
tender almost paternal

We hear Jasons steady even breathing and the quieter
breaths of the boy both leaving a trail of bubbles

side

JASON MALLINSON
He’s been breathing okay

Rick hears this with intense relief Up to this moment he had
no idea if the whole plan was going to work

RICK STANTON
Fucking brilliant

He changes the boy’s oxygen bottle

JASON MALLINSON
You didn’t think it would work

Rick gives a shake of his head

JASON MALLINSON

submerge

Harry speaks soothingly to Arm as he sedates him

HARRY
There we go Looks like you’ve got
John You’re lucky He’s the best
Did you hear about the World Cup
Belgium knocked out Brazil That
was a shocker

The rest of the boys high up the slope are now openly
watching but they make no sound Little Chai stares wide-
eyed as Arm drops unconscious He sees how his wrists and
ankles are tied

John and Arm are ready to go
CHRIS JEWELL
Aren’t we supposed to wait for

Rick

JOHN VOLANTHEN
I don’t want my boy waking up

He takes Arm a little way out into the water and looks into
his face to reassure himself that he’s breathing

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Anyone know my boy’s name

KIET
Arm He’s the team captain

On the slope Dr Karn is helping to prepare the next boy

Rick now enters the chamber and surfaces and gives a thumbs-
up

JOHN VOLANTHEN
Okay Arm Here goes

He pulls his own mask into place He dives carrying his boy
with him Rick comes out of the water

RICK STANTON

other hand on the guide line He checks Decha’s sedated face
in the mask listens for his breathing Feels his way round a
tight bend in the tunnel

He comes up in a stretch where there’s air space and he can
walk carrying the boy He feels Decha start to move then a
sudden jerk

Jason reaches for a syringe from the pack holding the boy
still against the rock wall with his knee He fumbles with
the syringe kit and drops it

Shit

He has to submerge and feel in the dark water for the kit
Decha’s eyes and hands are twitching Jason feels round more
urgently At last his fingers close on the kit He pulls it
out of the water

Decha is coming round Jason takes out a syringe fits the
needle reaches down to the boy’s leg He can’t see
underwater so he turns the boy round to get the leg out of
the water

In goes the needle Decha subsides into sedated stillness
Jason bows his head breathing hard feeling the strain

A few moments to recover then he reorganizes his load with
the boy drops back into the water and heads on down the
tunnel

breathing There’s the trail of bubbles
