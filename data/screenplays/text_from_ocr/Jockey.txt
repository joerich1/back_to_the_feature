EXT RACETRACK - PRE-DAWN

Turf Paradise A racetrack that has seen its glory days come
and go The starting gates are rusted The grandstands need

paint

But at sunrise the track is filled with life Jockeys
exercising horses of every color at every speed Trainers
watching from the rails gossiping

Off by themselves two older jockeys -- JACKSON SILVA and LEO
BROCK -- watch it all from the rail They’re admiring the
horses critiquing the riders Other jockeys go out of their

way to greet them

Man they
here this

Yeah they

Early too

trying to
horses in

Jackson laughs

LEO
got a bunch of horses out
morning

JACKSON

LEO

I think these trainers
be slick Work these
the dark

A horse gallops by so smooth it catches Leo’s attention

LEO (CONTD)

Look at that one there Looks like
he’s running downhill

They admire the horse as it passes

JACKSON

Hey you seen that new kid that’s
been training over at Jerry’s barn

Nope Can

LEO

JACKSON

Yeah he can ride all right Name’s

Gabriel

Leo considers what Jackson might actually be asking

Youll be

LEO
alright You know them

young ones they come and they go
They don’t hang around too long
Jackson looks away down the track

LEO (CONTD)
What’s wrong

JACKSON
It’s just you know it just ain’t
the same anymore Leo

LEO
Yeah you’re getting old

JACKSON
We’re both getting old

LEO
Yeah but I’m like wine though I’m
getting better

Jackson laughs He starts walking away

LEO (CONTD)
Where you going

JACKSON
We’ve gotta start work at some
point Leo

But Leo just turns back to watch the track

TITLE CARD

EXT RUTH’S BARN - SUNRISE

Jackson is walking back through the barns as the sky turns
slowly to day

His limp is rough as he walks toward Ruth’s barn and he
slowly corrects it brings it smooth

Jackson steps up to Ruth’s barn The horses sticking their
heads out to greet him He pulls a single cigarette from his
shirt pocket and lights it

RUTH WILKES appears down the shedrow carrying an empty feed
tub shaking out a saddle pad

RUTH
Morning

JACKSON
Mornin’ Ruth
RUTH
You got one more of those

He offers her the smoke

JACKSON

Go ahead and finish it
RUTH

You sure
JACKSON

I was just warming my lungs up

We get a good look at Ruth now taking stock of her barn as

she talks She’s someone who can keep track of ten horses
while talking to a jockey Someone who looks to be in her

50’s or her 30’s depending on the light

She

She

She

She

RUTH
Did you watch the replay of the
7th

starts cooking some oats in a bucket

JACKSON

RUTH
And What do you think’s going on
with Jupiter

RUTH (0S) (CONTD)
I’m listening

JACKSON
Youre right that’s what’s going
on

sticks her head out and smiles

RUTH
I was what

JACKSON
You were right he’s just lazy He
should’ve at least hit the board

disappears again
RUTH (0S)
I knew it That horse is a barrel
horse He’s got no business on the
track

JACKSON
Or a pony horse

She steps out with a cup of coffee

RUTH
But he bites Do you want any
coffee

JACKSON
Did you make it or did Benny make
it

RUTH
I did Fresh pot yesterday

JACKSON
I’m good

She smiles

JACKSON (CONTD)
So what are you gonna tell the
owner Is that a Caldwell horse

RUTH

Yep I’ve tried to tell him as many
ways as I know how that his horse
can’t run But he’s an expert

(yells across the barn)
Benny

(to Jackson)
So I’m going to say tough break
Tanner How about we try him in the
250 next week

Jackson laughs

Ruth steps back into her tack room pours some coffee and
steps out as Benny appears out of nowhere

RUTH (CONTD)
(to Benny)
How’s Rambo

Benny speaks in Spanish as Ruth talks to him in English
BENNY
He’s fine Ate all his alfalfa last
night

RUTH
Good Did Angel come to work today

BENNY
No He got arrested last night

RUTH
Arrested What for this time

Benny shrugs She sighs

RUTH (CONTD)
I guess I’m cleaning stalls today
Who’s ready first

BENNY

feed in their tubs

RUTH

BENNY
A little

RUTH
So just the walker for him today
Just ten minutes How about the
others

BENNY
Still eating

RUTH
Alright Get Dublin ready
(to Jackson)
Another day
Jackson pulls on his helmet
JACKSON
Could be the one we make our
millions

She smells the air

RUTH
Nope

They laugh

She checks her whiteboard that has the day’s plan for each
horse Jackson follows

RUTH (CONTD)
So just jog Dublin two times today
But wait until I get out there this
time I wanna take a look at that
right leg

JACKSON
All right I’1l gallop him just a
little

RUTH
No Not yet

JACKSON
He’s pretty solid on it He feels
good

RUTH
I’m still worried about that
pastern

JACKSON
Yeah but if we don’t start pushing
him at some point--

RUTH
(sharp)
Jackson Just Keep him tight
okay Ill be right out

He nods Takes the direction

EXT TRACK - MORNING

Jackson is on the back of Dublin now walking toward the
track The horse is excited in the early morning --
fidgeting tossing his head Jackson calms the horse
speaking softly as they walk

EXT BARNS - A LITTLE LATER

After morning workouts Jackson walks through the backside
greeting other jockeys trainers

The barns are bustling now with movement almost a small town
contained in itself Jackson is greeted like a legend by
almost everyone who passes
JACKSON
How you doing this morning

Someone passes on a golf cart
JACKSON (CONTD)
Another day in paradise ain’t that

right

An old friend rides a horse over to Jackson He has a new
horse he wants to introduce him to

Jackson talks to the horse as much as the rider

CUT TO

EXT RACETRACK STARTING GATES - AFTERNOON

Now in the starting gates -- the tense final moments before a
race The horse is jostling nervous excited

Jackson stares straight ahead down the track Completely
still atop the horse

Next to him a young jockey is not so still He steals a quick
glance at Jackson then looks ahead

Then all is still Quiet for just a moment

GATE MAN (0S)
Locked up

The gates slam open a bell rings and the horses fly away
down the track

INT JOCKS ROOM - LATER

The race is over now The tenor of the jock’s room (the
locker room for the jockeys) is calm relaxed

The jockeys from the last race strip their muddy silks
(racing uniforms) while other jockeys lounge waiting for
their next race Each prepares in their own way wrapping
wrists and ankles -- praying -- puking to shed a few more
pounds

We move through the jock’s room and finally land on Jackson
at his locker regaling five other jockeys with an old story
JACKSON
SO we’re coming into the final
stretch and there’s Jerry Lawhorne
far and away ahead of all of us
This is his race no doubt about
it The rest of us are just hoofing
for second But he was on a horse
called Diamond Dash and I knew a
thing or two about old Diamond Dash
-- I used to breeze that horse when
he was a two year old for--

SCOTT
--Was that Pete Williamson’s horse

JACKSON
You know Pete never had a horse of
that caliber
(thinks )
It was Rooney Garcia Down in
Houston

SCOTT
Ah yeah

JACKSON
(back to his story)
So the thing with Diamond Dash --
you couldn’t use a stick with that
horse As soon as you did he’d
just stop Right there on the
track

Jackson smiles

JACKSON (CONTD)
So I was on a horse called Luna
Bonita and I get her to give
everything she’s got to get up
there close to Jerry and when I get
within earshot I yell GO JERRY
I’M COMING FOR YOU And without
even thinking he popped that horse
once and that was all she wrote

All the jockeys laugh

CARL
(now in a new silk)
But wait I thought you said you
won but you lost
JACKSON
So check this Now the race was
mine Wide open I’m pushing Luna
and she was a smart horse but she
wasn’t a winner By the time we hit
the last furlong she was just about
gassed and I had three others
coming up on me I knew if I had
it it was gonna be by a nose So
we get right up there not ten
yards from the finish and boom
Luna stumbles She righted herself
but I was ready for anything but
that I went flying off right at
the finish In the photo it looks
like I’m running across the line
ahead of the damn horse

More laughter

CARL
Bullshit No way

LEO
He ain’t lying I’ve seen the
photo

SCOTT

So how’d you land

JACKSON
How’d I land Landed my picture in
the Cincinnati paper

The other jockeys laugh

INT JACKSON’S TRAILER - NIGHT

Jacksons home -- such as it is -- is an RV trailer just
outside the gates of the racetrack Not a lot to speak of
inside The only PHOTO on the wall is one of him as a baby
his grandfather holding him up on a horse

He prepares his dinner for the night a few baby carrots
half an apple

He steps into the living room and sits down for the last
nightly ritual before he sleeps He hooks his chest up to a
muscle stimulator with electrodes wires running to a
machine

Then he covers his knees and his shoulder with ice packs and
eats his dinner

INT JACKSONS TRAILER - PRE-DAWN

Jackson wakes slowly He sits on the edge of his bed
Stretches out each arm painfully His shoulders His neck

His right hand is moving slower than anything else He takes
up his riding stick and works it through the air But
nothing’s clicking

His right hand is TREMBLING like palsy He takes it in his
other hand to stop it

He looks around As if there might be someone to tell his
worries to

INT VETERNARIAN OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

Jackson stands in a dark office while RONNIE -- the track
veterinarian -- examines him with a portable x-ray meant for
horses

RONNIE

Stand very straight and still Take
a deep breath and hold it

Jackson breathes in deep Ronnie clicks a button sets the
portable x-ray aside

RONNIE (CONTD)
OK

Jackson exhales

An image of Jackson’s spine takes form on the laptop Ronnie
stares at it

JACKSON
Well Is it a boy or a girl

Ronnie doesn’t smile

RONNIE
You’ve done some damage here
Jackson You need to get yourself
to a doctor

JACKSON
You are a doctor

RONNIE
You know what I mean
JACKSON
Look You know what bones are
supposed to look like right

RONNIE
Yeah that’s why I
(considers how to say it)
How many times have you broken your
back

JACKSON
I don’t know Three I think

Ronnie lets Jackson’s own answer settle on him

JACKSON (CONTD)
Ronnie Listen I know it’s bad
ok I just need a gut check from
you Is it real bad Or just normal
bad

RONNIE
If this was an x-ray for one of
these horses I’d tell the trainer
to load him up and let him live out
his days in a pasture

JACKSON
Yeah but--

RONNIE
I wouldn’t clear him for another
race

Jackson is quiet now

RONNIE (CONTD)
Listen I have a friend a good
doctor a spinal doctor If you’re
having trouble with finances or
whatever he can help out But I
need you to go

Jackson is still quiet

RONNIE (CONTD)
I’m sorry Jackson

JACKSON
No it’s not your fault Here you

go

Jackson offers him a twenty

RONNIE
No It’s fine Don’t worry about
it We’re good

JACKSON
Alright doc Whatever you say

RONNIE
Take care Jackson

JACKSON
(to another jockey)
Youre up AJ

AJ Take it easy Jacks

EXT RACETRACK - DAY

A deep rumbling sound grows An ancient sound Like thunder
It gets stronger closer Then a group of horses flies by
camera in a race

MOMENTS LATER

All the jockeys walk back toward the jocks room after the
race Most are covered in mud Valets take their saddles as
they pass

A young jockey passes Jackson walking fast

JACKSON
(annoyed)
Careful with them gaps you’re
gonna clip heals

The young jockey ignores him
Ruth steps onto the track and falls into step with Jackson

RUTH
That’s alright Dublin hates being
on the outside How was he on the
turns

JACKSON
A little soft Still stutter-
stepping in the gates like friggin
Fred Astaire

RUTH
Yeah I don’t think we’re ever
gonna break him of that

JACKSON
China Cat’s up next

RUTH
Yeah You’re going to have a time
with him today He almost kicked
out my fucking teeth this morning

She smiles a bit at that for some reason

JACKSON
At least he’s keeping it
interesting I like ‘em feisty

RUTH
Well he’ll have the energy If you
want to get him out first I think
he’1l last

She stops him Asks him something she doesn’t want to

RUTH (CONTD)

Listen Dublin’s owners are here
and she really wants to meet you
Would you just come and say hello

JACKSON
Ruth

RUTH
Come on man she’s been on my case
for like two weeks Just say hi

JACKSON
Fine

Dublin’s owners wait for them by the rail Dressed better
than anyone else out here They’re all smiles as Ruth
approaches with Jackson

RUTH
Here he is

OWNER
Hey what happened out--

JACKSON
Howdy

Jackson doesn’t even slow down just waves as he walks past
Ruth tries to save face

RUTH
He’s gotta change right now He’s
got another race

INT JOCKS ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Jackson sits at his locker pulling off his silk and sliding
into some jeans

He sees the young jockey from the last race across the room
The young jockey’s leg is bouncing as he stares at the floor
nervous for another race

INT TRACK RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON

All the races are run The restaurant back by the barns is
full of jockeys eating their one big meal at the end of the
week talking shop with their agents and trainers

Jackson walks in looks around Nods to a few people he
knows Accepts some congratulations

Then he sees the young jockey sitting in the corner by
himself a heaping plate of food before him Jackson steps
over

JACKSON
Hey Mind if I sit down
GABRIEL
Sure
JACKSON
Youre Gabriel right Boullait
GABRIEL
Yeah
JACKSON

How’s your season going

GABRIEL
Pretty good Got a couple good
mounts I’m just trying to get some
wins under my belt Get me a agent

JACKSON
Ah I wouldn’t worry about getting
yourself an agent

(MORE )
JACKSON (CONTD)
When you’re ready for one they’ll
come find you Right now you just
focus on a good trainer do right
by ‘em you’ll be just fine

Jackson calls over his shoulder for the waitress

JACKSON (CONTD)
Gina Hey Gina can I get--

But she doesn’t respond

JACKSON (CONTD)
(to Gabriel)
Her name’s Gina right

GABRIEL
I don’t know

The waitress shuffles by

JACKSON
Gina

No response

JACKSON (CONTD)
I guess not So whereabouts are you
from anyway

GABRIEL
I was born in the south but I’m
from outside of San Diego really
Why

JACKSON
It’s just I used to know someone
with your last name What are you
doing here

GABRIEL
I’m hungry

JACKSON
No that’s not-- Here in Phoenix
What are you doing here in Phoenix

GABRIEL
I know a trainer He said he’d give
me work if I--

JACKSON
--But didn’t I see you in Remington
back in June And then in Houston
before that

Gabriel is quiet

JACKSON (CONTD)
Look I’m not trying to bust your
balls I’m just trying to
understand you know the chances
of us riding in the exact same
circuit

GABRIEL
What’s the question

JACKSON
I’m just saying if you need help
fine but when I got trainers
saying that you’re asking about me
and I see you at one track after
another but you never talk
directly to me then that makes me--

GABRIEL
You’re my dad

JACKSON
Do what

GABRIEL
I’m I’m your son

This stops Jackson cold

Gabriel just stares at him like he didn’t mean to let it
slip

GABRIEL (CONTD)
I didn’t know how to say

Then Jackson starts laughing hysterically

JACKSON
(still laughing)
Oh man Shit Boy you stopped my
heart there for a second Hey did
Leo put you up to this He did
didn’t he

But Gabriel is silent It’s not a joke

Jackson slowly stops laughing
JACKSON (CONTD)
(sober)
Kid You serious with me

Gabriel’s silence says yes

JACKSON (CONTD)
Your mom’s Ana Boullait

Gabriel nods tentatively

JACKSON (CONTD)
Look I don’t know what she told
you but that’s not possible I’m
not gonna get into the particulars
of it but you and I we are not
related

GABRIEL
My mom doesn’t know that I came to
talk to you

JACKSON
I don’t care if she does That’s
not the point

GABRIEL
I just wanted to meet you I wanted
to talk--

JACKSON
Okay you wanted to talk Talk about
what

GABRIEL
I don’t know Talk about like we
both--

JACKSON

I don’t have anything to give you

GABRIEL
I’m not asking you for anything--

JACKSON
I barely have enough money for
myself I’m sure you probably
caught wind of my winnings and came
to some conclusions but if you’d
been doing this for any amount of
time you’d know that by the time
your earnings get carved up
there’s not a whole lot left for
the jockey

GABRIEL
I’m not asking for money

JACKSON
Good Cause I ain’t got nothing
else to give you I can’t tell you
which tracks you can and can’t go
on and I really don’t care but
don’t go around here telling people
youre my kid It makes me look
like an asshole And you know what
I don’t need

GABRIEL
JACKSON
To look like an asshole

Gabriel is just staring at him Somewhere between wounded and
angry

GABRIEL
(insistent)
I’m not asking for anything

JACKSON
Good Then we’re on the same page

Jackson stands and drops some cash on the table

JACKSON (CONTD)
Here kid Breakfast is on me

Jackson walks out of the restaurant without saying goodbye to
anyone
EXT JACKSONS TRAILER - SUNSET

Jackson sits outside his trailer watching the sun go down
smoking a cigarette

The stars are peeking out between the trees He sighs heavy

EXT RUTH’S BARN - MORNING

Jackson comes back from exercising his last horse of the
morning Rio Bravo

Ruth meets him at the barn entrance before he can slip away

RUTH
Hey You got one more in you I’ve
got a new one I want you to look
at

JACKSON
That roan gelding from JB’s

RUTH
Nope Brand new

JACKSON
Can it uh wait until tomorrow

RUTH
I’ve been wanting to tell you about
her so bad but I was worried I
would jinx it if I talked to you
about her

She’s having trouble containing her excitement He smiles a
little

JACKSON
Sure

EXT EXERCISE PEN - MOMENTS LATER

In an open pen a horse is wheeling freely No reins no
halter The horse jumps and rolls in the soft sand

It’s a beautiful creature A horse that would’ve been painted
on cave walls long ago

Jackson stops when he gets close He can only stare
RUTH
I just brought her out from the

farm This’ll be her maiden year

JACKSON

RUTH
Well

JACKSON
I mean she’s perfect She looks
like she knows it too

RUTH
She’s always had that look

JACKSON
Who told you about this horse

RUTH

She’s mine I bought her at a
yearling sale for next to nothing
Nobody wanted her Her legs were
too long her head was way too big
But I saw her in the stall and I
just knew she was

(loses the words)
It was the way she watched the
world Everybody said I was crazy
for spending anything on her they
said I should send her to the
rodeo

JACKSON
(almost to himself)
But you knew

RUTH
Well we’ll see

JACKSON
What’s her name

RUTH
Dido’s Lament

JACKSON
Out of Russo’s Lamentation

RUTH
And Dido’s Mercy

Dido’s Lament stops a moment to look out across the track as
if she’s waiting for something Then goes back to pawing the
sand

JACKSON
Well can she run

RUTH
Only one way to find out

Jackson smiles Pulls on his helmet
JACKSON

(to Dido’s Lament)
You ready

EXT RACETRACK - A LITTLE LATER

Jackson runs Dido’s Lament around the track in the late
morning light We experience this all through his POV
gliding down the track as if on another plane of reality

If there’s any way to convey the magic that he feels in this

moment the music and the light and the poetry of slow motion
come close

EXT RUTH’S BARN - A LITTLE LATER

Ruth washes Dido’s Lament with a sponge talking softly as
she does The horse doesn’t seem tired in the least

Jackson just stares

RUTH
Okay Benny

Benny leads Dido back to her stall

JACKSON
She’s like a swan with teeth

Ruth laughs
JACKSON (CONTD)

I haven’t been on a horse like
that in a long time

RUTH
I know she can run But is she a
winner

JACKSON

If there’s any justice in this
world What race are you putting
her in first Mile and an eighth

RUTH
No I don’t want to take her that
long Not on her first one

JACKSON
Shell win it I guarantee you

RUTH
Yeah but I want her to win it by a
mile Give her confidence at seven
furlongs And then we’ll stretch
her out Build her stamina And
then
JACKSON
Futurity

RUTH
(smiles)
Futurity

Jacksons mind is running It seems to go somewhere

RUTH (CONTD)
What

JACKSON

Ruth You know as soon as I clock
out you’re gonna have every young
jockey lining up outside your barn
I don’t wanna

(thinks of how to say it)
I don’t have any expectations I
know you’ve been waiting a long
time for a horse like this

RUTH
Jackson We’ve come this far
together right

Jackson tries to stifle a smile

RUTH (CONTD)
But we gotta be serious about it
You and I’ve gotten a little
comfortable these last few years

JACKSON
Yep I’ve got some weight to work
off But I swear I’1l get it down
Don’t worry about me

RUTH
If we’re gonna do this we can’t
leave anything to chance

JACKSON
No ma’am

EXT RACETRACK GRANDSTANDS - LATE AFTERNOON

dark

It’s the long part of the afternoon where most jockeys are
napping trying to forget they’re hungry

But Jackson is on the stairs of the grandstands running

stadiums

One after another

When he gets to the top of another round he trips and
catches himself just before he face-plants

He turns over and sits there trying to catch his breath a
moment Then he notices HIS HAND IS TREMBLING AGAIN

It takes a while to stop this time

He stares out at the empty track It feels like a lonely
place

Finally he stands pushes himself up the stairs again

INT JOCKS ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

A tall scale from another era stands next to the showers in
the jocks room Jackson steps onto it waits for the numbers
to settle

When they finally do he fiddles with it Like it might be
stuck But the scale is true He steps away shaking his head
in disgust

INT TRACK CHURCH - LATER

Jackson steps into the church on the back of the track A
group of jockeys sit in a circle talking Having coffee
They’ve been here a while

They give Jackson a hard time about being late

He settles into the group and they resume their conversation
It slowly reveals itself to be a support group of sorts where
they talk about the joys and struggles of their lives

The following was not written but was spoken by real jockeys
in their own words

MARTIN
I think the quarter horses are
gonna run with twenty-eight--

MIKE
One twenty-eight yeah Because
they were saying that because
there’s so many taller riders now
and bigger riders that have to cut
weight -- they’re cutting so much
weight that when they do go down
there’s nothing protecting their
bones And that’s why so many of us
are getting hurt now
SCOTT
Yeah You know when that gate
opens we got one job and that’s
to try to win the race And if I
feel like I’m on something that I
can’t try on then I don’t want to
ride it

Martin speaks haltingly

MARTIN
I got dropped in a quarter horse
race Shattered my femur my right
femur broke all the ribs on the
front and back broke three more on
the other side Punctured both
lungs And that’s what took me
exactly nine months to come back

SCOTT
That’s a long time to be living on
the disability The two hundred a
week

MARTIN
Yep Especially when you have kids
you know And you have to Even
though the first two or three
months I was hurt especially the
little ones they’re three and
five they didn’t want no part of
me going back and ride

SCOTT

They don’t want their daddy hurt
MARTIN

No
MIKE

I was on a quarter horse rode her
before the race I had just won on
her Came out of the gates was
in front and as we were coming on
to the main part of the track she
stumbled and well she had a
really sensitive mouth So when I
go to pick her up she just tosses
her head and jerks me right over
her head

(MORE)

MIKE (CONTD)

Runs right over the top of me and
broke my nose in three places my
left eye socket my upper jaw on
both sides fractured the back of
my skull back here and I had a
bleed on my brain I can’t smell or
taste anything now because of that

The jockeys all nod to each other on the shared pain

MIKE (CONTD)
Yeah the only thing I can smell is
like a fire and I can taste
something that’s burnt I can’t
taste nothing else

SCOTT
Do they think it could come back

MIKE

They said it could but it’s gonna
take another hit to my head to make
it come back So I was like I’1l
live without it

All the jockeys laugh
MIKE (CONTD)
I figured the best way to get over
my fears was to get back on the
same horse I got back on her and
worked her and then rode her ina
race Everything went smooth I
didn’t ride her again after that
The jockeys laugh again

Jackson can only listen Not ready yet to open up

EXT JERRY MEYER’S BARN - ANOTHER DAY

Jackson is walking on the backside and sees Gabriel pushing a
wheelbarrow out of a rundown barn adding to a manure pile
the size of a shed

Jackson argues with himself over approaching him

Then finally decides to walk over to him

Gabriel sees him approaching and stops Steels himself

JACKSON
(casually)
Jerrys got you cleaning stalls
huh

Gabriel pushes the wheelbarrow right past him

JACKSON (CONTD)
Make sure to count every dollar he
gives you He was counterfeiting
bills a few years back Tens
mostly

Gabriel pauses

JACKSON (CONTD)
Listen About the other morning I
don’t I’m not really It’s
just not true you know I don’t
know what your mama told you but
she was ah hell we were all
pretty wild back then you know
And that timeline just wouldn’t add

up

Gabriel just looks back at the barn trying to hide what he’s
feeling

JACKSON (CONTD)
How many uh how many stalls you
got left

GABRIEL
About a dozen Then I have to rake
down the shedrow and spray it down

JACKSON
Well listen I’ve got to work out
I’m carrying a little extra weight
You want to join me

After some hesitation
GABRIEL

Yeah sure Let me just finish up
here

INT JOCKS ROOM - LATER
Gabriel sits on an equicisor (a fake horse used for training)

with Jackson standing beside him The TV is playing races in
front of them A race is about to begin

JACKSON
Alright get ready Let’s see your
stance

Gabriel crouches into his racing position

JACKSON (CONTD)
OK hang on hang on Let’s just
start back down

Gabriel sits back on the fake horse

JACKSON (CONTD)
Let me see your grip

Gabriel takes the reins

JACKSON (CONTD)
Is that your starting position
That’s the one you like

Gabriel nods Jackson adjusts his grip on the reins

JACKSON (CONTD)
You want to make sure you have
enough space to grab that mane
Then you’re not falling back on the
jump And then if you double up
these reins you’1ll have more
control Won’t have to fidget with
the reins so much

GABRIEL
Got it

JACKSON
OK Let’s go

Gabriel stands back in racing position and Jackson starts to
move the neck of the equicisor up and down as if it’s picking
up speed He guides Gabriel through an imagined race

JACKSON (CONTD)
Get ready you’re gonna come into
that final turn Lean into it Let
him feel that weight on that left
shoulder there you go not too
much cause he might throw ya
There you go

Gabriel’s entire body starts to tremble from the pain

JACKSON (CONTD)

Make sure you get low Use that
head to block that air coming
across There you go There you go
Coming down the final stretch Let
him feel you pushing on his neck
Tell him to move And crossing the
finish line Boom

Gabriel collapses back onto the fake horse catching his
breath

GABRIEL
Ahh shit

JACKSON
How was that

GABRIEL
Alright

JACKSON
Be that easy on the day

Gabriel laughs

GABRIEL
My fuckin’ knee

JACKSON
You riding with a bum knee I won’t
tell nobody Everybody’s got
something around here

GABRIEL
It’s just my ACL I tore it It
pops out of the socket sometimes

Jackson just nods Nothing to say to that

EXT JACKSONS TRAILER - EVENING

Jackson and Gabriel are exercising back at Jackson’s trailer

This is easy for Gabriel He jumps rope forward backwards
Double-time triple-time

Jackson is trying to keep up His feet get caught in his
rope

JACKSON

Jackson rests in his chair while Gabriel keeps jumping rope
He pulls out a weathered deck of cards

JACKSON (CONTD)

JACKSON
Well here’s another game for you

Gabriel back straight squats down picking up one card at a
time His focus matches what we saw on the equicisor

JACKSON (CONTD)
There you go One at a time Keep
your back straight When you’re on
that horse you’re gonna be doing
the exact same thing

Gabriel gets through as many squats as he can He trembles as
he stands up straight

JACKSON (CONTD)

times Gabriel on the bike both pouring sweat

JACKSON

starts pedaling furiously

GABRIEL

ice cubes from a bucket

A LITTLE LATER

room Jackson watches Gabriel smiles

JACKSON
Oh yeah How’d you do

GABRIEL
I cut three pounds

JACKSON
Three pounds That’s a good
afternoon
Gabriel steps off heads to the showers

Jackson steps on the scale watches the numbers float around
and finally settle

GABRIEL (0S)
How’d you do

Jackson stares at the scale
JACKSON
Not so good Well see you around

Jackson leaves without another word

INT JACKSON’S TRAILER - NIGHT

Jackson has just showered He’s drying his hair with a towel
looking in the mirror He inspects his hairline The skin on
his cheeks

He sees the toilet bowl behind him in the mirror He
considers it

Then he bends down and in one smooth motion forces himself
to throw up

It comes easy But painfully

He retches everything up Mostly water

He hangs on the toilet bowl a moment

INT TRACK RESTAURANT - ANOTHER DAY

Jackson finds Ruth pouring over her TRAINING LOG What horses
are fit What vitamins they need It’s a maze of information
that only she could understand

She has a half-eaten plate of breakfast next to her papers

Jackson sits down
RUTH
(of the food)
Hey Sorry you want me to toss
this while we talk

JACKSON
Naw I still like the smell of it

Ruth smiles

RUTH
(of Dido’s Lament)
How was she this morning

JACKSON
She’s from another planet The good
news is we’re not gonna have to
teach her anything You just keep
her healthy and point her down the
track

RUTH
What’s the bad news

JACKSON
The bad news is we’re not gonna be
able to take all the credit when
she wins the futurity
She laughs

RUTH
I can be ok with that

Jackson is quiet His mind elsewhere

RUTH (CONTD)
How you doing Jacks

JACKSON
Real good I’m feeling good

Ruth looks for how to ask more

RUTH
Is there anything else going on

JACKSON
I don’t What do you mean

RUTH
I mean are you feeling all right

JACKSON
(getting testy)
Why don’t you just tell me what
youre driving at

RUTH
I just You’re leaning off to
your left in the saddle You’re
fidgeting with your reins more than
I’ve ever seen you You seem tense
when you’re in the gates--

JACKSON
Tense

RUTH
Benny said you tripped the other
morning coming out of a stall

JACKSON
Well fuck Benny And you’ve never
tripped

RUTH
Man just tell me what’s going on

JACKSON
Look I’d tell you if there was
something to tell It’s just
It’s just wear and tear

RUTH
Weve always been straight with
each other

JACKSON

(sharp)
Then why are you riding me

(calmer )
Look I know I’m not in the same
shape as these young cats And I
don’t have any illusions about how
long I can keep this up But I
still got a good couple years left
in me

RUTH
I don’t give a shit about those
younger jockeys I’m not comparing
you Nobody knows a horse like you
do Jackson I just you know if I
see something I gotta say it
SO

Ruth stops pushing Sees it’s going nowhere

RUTH (CONTD) JACKSON
Hey I just want to know (sharp)

Jackson softens They both sit there awkwardly a moment

JACKSON (CONTD)
Alright then I’ve got some errands
to run

RUTH
(sharp)
OK

Ruth watches him walk out

INT JOCKS’ ROOM STEAM ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Jackson sits woozy in the sweatbox Leo’s voice is fading in
from the background

Jackson tries to blink into focus Leo is speaking but his
words are OUT OF SYNC with his mouth

Leo is saying something about his time in jail What it
taught him

Jackson dozes in and out

LEO
Jackson Hey Jackson

Leo tosses an ice cube across the room It snaps Jackson back
to reality

LEO (CONTD)
You up You gotta go get yourself
some potassium or something You’re
gonna get someone hurt out there if
you fall off cause you’re too weak
to ride

EXT TRACK - EVENING

Jackson stands alone in the middle of the track It’s just
him the birds and the fading light of day

INT JOCKS’ ROOM - RACE DAY

Jackson is sitting at his locker His hand starts shaking He
watches it trying to will it to stop then he grabs hold of
it

He wraps his wrists in med-wrap for the next race

The TV is piping in races live from the track A few jockeys
stand around watching it

The race starts all the horses flying down the track

But then something goes wrong Two horses bump each other A
rider is thrown and goes under the running horses

The jockeys all groan then the room goes silent as they
stare

The jockey that fell lays still on the ground

RAMON
Was that Martin

MARTIN
No I’m here

SCOTT
Was that Jests

MARTIN
No that was Leo

They all go silent Watching the TV as the ambulance pulls
out onto the track

Jackson steps closer to the TV His face drained

EXT JOCKS’ ROOM - EVENING

Jackson steps out of the jocks’ room just showered hair
combed He sees Gabriel chatting up some local girls

GABRIEL
Hey Jackson Want to go have
dinner with us

JACKSON
I’m not hungry Thanks

GABRIEL
Well hold on These girls know who
you are

Jackson looks beyond Gabriel Considers the girls

JACKSON
Yeah thanks I’ve gotta take care
of something

GABRIEL

trying to hang

JACKSON
They took Leo to Sima

GABRIEL
Oh shit
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Leo lays in a hospital bed hooked up to all manner of tubes
and wires His hips and mid-section are encased in a brace

Leo’s eyes are closed so Jackson just sits next to him
quietly

LEO
(eyes still closed)
How’s that filly doing

JACKSON
She’s gonna be alright It’s gonna
be just fine

Leo opens his eyes and turns his head to Jackson

LEO
This never should have happened I
should have never tried to run that
filly She was too young And then
I just put myself in a bad spot

He stops Can’t think about it

LEO (CONTD)
The doctor already came in and told
me that my pelvis and my hip’s
shattered they’re tore up

JACKSON
Listen Leo You’re gonna get up
again I know it You’re gonna get
up again and--
LEO
Stop Don’t lie to me Jackson I
don’t wanna hear that right now

Jackson just listens now
Leo looks up at the TV The local news

LEO (CONTD)
Here I am My whole life gone
Didn’t even make the news

Jackson just listens now

LEO (CONTD)
You remember when Randy Bennett
flatlined on the way to the
hospital out at Remington

JACKSON

You know death is You can’t be
afraid of death Any more than a
baby can be afraid of being born
It just takes us to whatever’s
next And then we go to wherever
after that And we got no say on
when our ticket’s up

LEO
I ain’t afraid of death I’m just
afraid of not being able to ride
Out of all the things you do in
life everybodys always
criticizing the good and the bad
and all of this but there’s that
one minute that you feel like
youre the most important thing in
the world because everybodys
watching you

Leo gets quiet a moment

LEO (CONTD)

You need to go out there and talk
to Mr Willie He’s the one that’s
sending all these good yearlings
and two year olds out this year
You got to make investments You
got to look out for you Because
these trainers don’t give a fuck
all they wanna do is run us through
there We’re expendable to them

JACKSON
(trying not to cry)
Well you ain’t expendable to me

LEO
Well fuck you Jackson You’re so
full of shit

They both laugh Leto gets quiet again

LEO (CONTD)
Thank you For coming to see me It
means a lot to me

Jackson just nods

LEO (CONTD)
Now you think you can go get me
something to eat I could eat the
asshole out of a skunk right now
Just get all kinds of shit man I
don’t have to flip no more I can
get fat like you

Jackson laughs
JACKSON

Alright I’1l go get something

good
EXT JACKSON’S TRAILER - NIGHT
Jackson drives back to his trailer It’s dark out now and
there by his door is Gabriel holding a styrofoam tray of
food

Jackson steps out to him

GABRIEL
Figured you might be hungry

Gabriel hands him the tray
JACKSON
Thanks I’ll save it for later

He waves his hand like it’s too long a story
GABRIEL (CONTD)

JACKSON

Jackson considers saying a few things Lands on

JACKSON
You know people try to do the best
they can as they go along And I
remember your mama having a pretty
tough time of it when she was

young
GABRIEL
At least she was able to pass that
along
JACKSON

My folks are both gone I wish I
could have been a little more
forgiving of them when they were
around is all

Gabriel just takes that in

JACKSON (CONTD)
You’re a good kid Gabriel You’re
gonna be alright

Jackson pulls his keys out of his pocket

JACKSON (CONTD)
Hey you need a ride

GABRIEL

on his farm he’d like to see about buying

Jackson goes to a horse farm outside of town It’s a series
of pastures with young horses yearlings and two year olds
in relative freedom to the horses at the track

He’s greeted by an old trainer WILLIE

JACKSON
Boy I had a tough time finding
this place

WILLIE
Oh really

JACKSON
Yes sir You’re quite out here

Willie looks out at the suburban stretch of houses in the
distance

WILLIE
Yeah we’re out in the boonies all
right But it’s building up Pretty

Willie walks him over to see the young horses out in a small
corral

WILLIE (CONTD)
So you’re looking to buy one

JACKSON
Yessir Can’t be a jockey forever

Willie smiles

WILLIE
Them two right there are decent
horses

JACKSON

WILLIE
Well they run in all kinds of
colors I had an old man helping me
when I was first starting out and I
asked him I said what color you

them fast colors

Jackson laughs
JACKSON
Yeah that’s the same color I’m
looking for
They watch the horses a moment
WILLIE
Well come on I’1ll show you another
one Might be just the one for you
A LITTLE LATER
Willie shows Jackson a few other horses Talks about the
better qualities of each one
EXT HORSE FARM - SUNSET

They’re quiet as they’re walking out toward Jackson’s truck

INT RUTH’S BARN - ANOTHER NIGHT

Ruth and Jackson are standing at the entrance of her barn
waiting on someone

Benny sits on a chair nearby cleaning his fingernails with a
pocket knife

Ruth checks her watch again

RUTH

RUTH

Carlos leads a horse to them saddled

It takes Gabriel a moment to process then he steps to the
horse Greets it Jackson gives him a leg up

GABRIEL

to know by how he sits the horse

RUTH
Hop down

GABRIEL
That’s it

RUTH

(quietly to Jackson)
He even mounts a horse like you

Jackson smiles a little She walks away

Gabriel hops off the horse Jackson waits until Ruth
disappears into the barn

JACKSON
Can you believe that

GABRIEL
(confused)
What

JACKSON
She loved you

INT JOCKS’ ROOM ENTRANCE - LATER

A group of jockeys stand in a circle GABRIEL among them The
CHAPLAIN in the middle finishing up a devotional and a
prayer before the race

Jackson stands on the edge watching Gabriel

The jockeys all leave the room some crossing themselves on
the way out Jackson walks next to Gabriel

JACKSON

(quietly)
See that guy in the four silk He’s
going to cut inside as soon as he
leaves the gates Everybody in the
first three holes is fucked Give
yourself some time on the outside
before moving in and you’1l be
alright

Jackson keeps walking before Gabriel can thank him for the
advice

INT JOCKS ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Jackson stands watching the TV with the live race feed Not
many other jockeys are paying attention to this race

The horses are loaded into the gates
ANNOUNCER (0S)
And loading in at number 5 is
Rio Bravo from trainer Ruth Wilkes
Ridden for the first time by a
newcomer Gabriel Boullait

Jackson watches intently Even a little nervous

The gates BURST open and the horses sprint out into the race

Jackson watches every detail of the race Silently cheering
Gabriel on willing him to win

Gabriel starts back in fifth place Then slowly starts to
climb out of the pack

By the time they get to the backstretch Gabriel has taken
second place and is fighting for the lead

A smile emerges on Jackson’s face as Gabriel crosses the
finish line In first place

Then he hides the smile and walks back to his locker

INT JOCKS’ ROOM - AFTER THE RACE

As Gabriel steps back into the jocks’ room most of the
jockeys erupt into applause for him They’re congratulating
him as he walks to his locker

Then a helmet SLAMS into a locker Everyone goes silent and
turns to see Scott striding toward Gabriel

SCOTT
Were you on the seven horse

GABRIEL
Yeah

Scott steps up and PUNCHES him -- Gabriel folds
SCOTT
Don’t you ever cut me off again you
little shit You’ll get somebody
hurt out there

No one says anything Scott calmly starts to walk toward the
bathroom

The Jackson appears behind him and SLAMS him into a locker
JACKSON
You throw another tantrum like that
and I’1l kick your fucking teeth
in

Scott stares back at him But doesn’t fight

JACKSON (CONTD)
This ain’t Houston

Scott looks around at everyone watching him

ELI
Gabe won his first stakes race Ice
him

That jockey and a few others swarm Gabriel and carry him to
the ice baths in the back of the jocks’ room and drop him
into an ICE BATH

Jackson and Scott are standing there watching Gabriel get
carried off

SCOTT
How you been Jackson

Jackson is quiet a moment still stewing

JACKSON
I’m alright You been good

SCOTT
Yeah hanging in there
(loosens up a little)
Haven’t had a great year But I
think Los Alamitos’1l be better

JACKSON
You always had good luck on that
track

They’re quiet a minute longer

SCOTT
Well Take it easy

JACKSON
You too Be careful out there

They part ways as if they came together just to catch up

EXT TRACK INFIELD POND - NIGHT

A bunch of jockeys are partying at the pond in the middle of
the racetrack Drinking and grilling fajitas and stoking a
bonfire

GABRIEL is sitting off to the side with JACKSON who’s half-
drunk on tequila Gabriel is drinking a beer eating a
fajita

He’s watching A YOUNG WOMAN his age with pink hair over
near the water with her friends

He’s half-listening as Jackson gives him advice
JACKSON
-and you also need to be combing
your hair between races Doesn’t
have to be perfect but you need to
look like every race is your first
one of the night Gives the owners
confidence Otherwise you make your
trainer look bad And if you make
Ruth look bad

GABRIEL
Oh Ruth already got pissed at me

JACKSON
What about

GABRIEL
About watching the crowd too much
on the parade

JACKSON
She doesn’t want you getting
distracted

GABRIEL
But if I run a good race--

JACKSON
Listen You ride the horse Ruth
rides you the owner rides her
That’s how it works Don’t take it
personal But you better take it
seriously

Gabriel is quiet a moment like he doesn’t buy it
Someone yells out from near the grill

RYAN (0S)
Hey Jackson you gonna dance for us
tonight or what

JACKSON
Nah man Maybe next time I’m all
stove up

RYAN
Stop it you lost

JACKSON
Man I’m gonna go get me a tequila
You gotta come meet Carl He’s a
weirdo

GABRIEL
(watching the girl)
Ill be there in a sec

Jackson walks away

A LITTLE LATER

A MONTAGE of Gabriel flirting with girls Jackson drinking
with old friends giving younger jockeys a hard time all as
the glow of a fire dances around them

The jockeys finally convince Jackson to dance -- a routine
that seems familiar to them all but still special

Jackson grabs a few errant BOTTLE CAPS off a nearby table He
puts them on the ground upside down and steps on them so
they’re lodged into the sole of his boot

Jackson starts to tap dance

The music and the sound of the party slowly fades out and
Jackson’s dance feels more lyrical he seems lighter

He is happy

He finishes and all the sound rushes back applause and
whistling and calls for more

He looks over and sees two seats empty Gabriel’s and the
girl’s

Jackson pretends not to care and reaches for another drink

INT JOCKS’ ROOM - ANOTHER RACE DAY

Jackson is on the equicisor in the jocks’ room The room is
cold empty Jackson is having trouble settling into
position Everything aches

Even the reins seem stiff

Yet slowly he loosens his body up fighting past pain

His limp is glaring as he walks out of the jocks’ room But

when he gets to the door he takes a deep breath straightens
up and walks out with barely the hint of a limp

EXT PADDOCK - A LITTLE LATER

Jackson waits with the other jockeys for the horses to be
brought around Ruth stands with him

ANNOUNCER (0S)
And finally rounding out the card
Dido’s Lament Trainer Ruth Wilkes
ridden by Jackson Silva This is
her maiden race and her current
odds are nineteen to one

Ruth and Jackson share a smile at those odds

RUTH
Wish I’d made a bet

She sighs

JACKSON
You nervous

RUTH
First day of school

JACKSON
She’s about to skip two grades
INT STARTING GATES - A LITTLE LATER

Jackson is in the gates bringing his breath under control
Talking softly to Dido’s Lament

His ankle is trembling but soon he brings that still too

The gates pop and they launch out into the race

EXT RACETRACK - IN THE RACE

In the middle of the race we’re in Jackson’s perspective
The only sound is that of the wind All else is silence

His view floats in slow motion like he’s flying over the
dirt

No other horse comes into the periphery

No other horse ever contends for the lead

EXT WINNER’S CIRCLE - MOMENTS LATER

Ruth and Jackson pose with Dido’s Lament for the winners
photo

Jackson is hiding the pain under a smile for the camera
Ruth turns to Jackson as the flashes stop

RUTH
I don’t care how much weight you
gain tonight we’re gonna
celebrate

EXT RODEO BAR - THAT NIGHT

Ruth and Jackson sit in the stands of a rodeo bar a bull
ring before them bar behind them They nurse beers watching
the show Laughing Arguing over whether they should cheer
for the rider or the bull

INT RODEO BAR - NIGHT

RUTH
(as revealing a secret)

Jackson gets quiet

RUTH (CONTD)

Ruth searches for the words

RUTH (CONTD)
You know it’s the claiming races

last barn on the backside And it’s
okay you know It’s enough You

up and she is

Ruth just smiles thinking about her Thinking about all

RUTH (CONTD)
And you remember You want it all

JACKSON

Gabriel appears He takes Jackson’s shot and downs it

of

JACKSON (CONTD)

GABRIEL

GABRIEL
They’re charging twenty dollars to
get on the bull No no hold on I

(to Jackson)
OK I’m dancing Who’s gonna dance

GABRIEL

Ruth downs her shot and steps out with Jackson to dance
around the bonfire with other locals
INT JACKSON’S TRAILER - NIGHT

The dance from the fireside flows into Jackson’s trailer as
the two of them sway to an old song on the radio

They laugh and joke together slurring their words

RUTH
I’ve got time for one more

Jackson looks around for clean glasses

JACKSON
Are those shot glasses clean

RUTH
Theyre filthy

Jackson laughs

JACKSON
I got more over here

Ruth starts to roll a joint on some old CDs
Jackson reaches up into his cabinet for clean glasses He
wobbles a little but catches his balance He brings a glass
down inspects it
JACKSON (CONTD)
I think I got a real clean-ish
glass right here

He reaches up into the cabinet for another glass but stops
Lowers his arm

Something felt weird Ruth doesn’t notice
He cranes his neck Rolls his right shoulder

He tries to take a step away from the counter and DROPS TO
THE FLOOR

RUTH
Jackson

She rushes to help him

JACKSON
I’m alright I’m alright

RUTH
What happened Is it your heart

JACKSON
No nothing like that I just can’t
exactly feel my right side Just
need a minute

He tries to get up but can’t
RUTH
Jesus man Do you want me to help
you move or

JACKSON
Yeah let’s try it

She helps him sit up and lean back on the cabinet

settles in next to him

JACKSON (CONTD)
Alright We’re good It just
happens sometimes It’1l come back
in a second

They’ve both sobered up quick

JACKSON (CONTD)
I might be in a little worse shape
than I thought

RUTH
(sarcastic)

He laughs a nervous laugh Then he gets quiet again

JACKSON
I do Yeah

RUTH
Oh Jackson Can you feel that

Jackson nods as Ruth runs her hand up his arm

JACKSON
No But it’ll come back It just
I’m sitting here

Searches for the words

JACKSON (CONTD)
I just can’t stop thinking about
Billy Parham the night he got
thrown out in Pompano He said he
heard birds singing in the jocks’
room Kept saying is there birds
in here Did somebody let a bird
in He didn’t even make it to the
hospital You remember that

Ruth just listens

JACKSON (CONTD)
Ive never been scared before

Ruth
Jackson accepts that he just said this out loud

JACKSON (CONTD)
There it is

RUTH
Hey What’s she like out there
Dido What’s she like

JACKSON
Dido is like a a horse I never
thought I’d get to ride You know

horse like Dido

Ruth tears up

RUTH
She’s the first horse I’ve ever had
that made me wish I was a jockey

JACKSON
(smiles)
Well hey There’s still time for

you

Ruth laughs

JACKSON (CONTD)
You know you get older and you
start to realize that you and your
body they just ain’t the same
thing You know what I mean

They’re both quiet now

JACKSON (CONTD)
I think this might be my last
season Ruth

RUTH
No shit Jackson

She takes his hand

JACKSON
Alright I think it’s coming back

RUTH
You want me to help you get up on
the couch

JACKSON
No Let’s just sit here for a
while longer Can we

RUTH
Sure we can

They sit quietly Even the radio seems to offer them silence
now

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

JACKSON lays on a table in a blank room -- shirtless arms
up The table starts to move and he’s run legs first through
a CT scanner

It’s clear that his thoughts are far away All the sound is
murky compressed as if he’s underwater

A LITTLE LATER

Jackson sits on a paper-covered examining bed A doctor
stands over him speaking

We can’t hear the doctor All the sound is gone now

But from the look on Jackson’s face we know that the news is
terrible

EXT BARNS - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

Jackson walks back behind the track watching the daily
ritual of the afternoon work go on Horses are bathed and

walked Shed rows are raked smooth

All irrespective of him

EXT INFIELD POND - AFTERNOON

Back at the small pond lies in the infield of the track a
fountain in the middle Gabriel sits by himself on the bank
with a fishing pole

Jackson comes walking up behind him carrying a DUFFEL BAG

JACKSON
Catching anything

GABRIEL
Some catfish Nothing else really
out here

JACKSON
There’s some carp out there too
But you don’t wanna eat them Got
fertilizer for blood
(hands Gabriel a coffee)

Here

GABRIEL
Thanks Got a burger in that bag
too

They both take a seat in the grass Jackson hands him a
cigarette

JACKSON
A couple sips of that coffee and
one of these will get you through a
meal every time

They stare out at the water a minute and smoke Sip some
coffee

Jackson passes Gabriel the DUFFEL BAG

GABRIEL
What’s that

JACKSON
Open it

Jackson helps Gabriel unzip the bag trying to hide his
excitement

The duffel is filled with new jockey tack expensive riding
pants new goggles a gorgeous pair of boots

JACKSON (CONTD)
Those boots should fit ya good and
snug If they don’t I’1ll take you
to Booker’s and--

GABRIEL
This stuff is nice Jackson I
can’t take this

JACKSON
It’s a gift I’d be offended if you
didn’t take it

Gabriel stares at the boots He looks to Jackson Jackson is
watching the lake

GABRIEL
Thank you You know there’s a lot
of people that say they want to
help but they’re looking for
something I haven’t met a lot of
people that just--

JACKSON
I know Just don’t start losing
There’s nothing worse losing a race
in new gear It’s like you’re
trying to buy the part or
something

Jackson lays back on the grass and sighs Closes his eyes

JACKSON (CONTD)
I love this time of day

Jackson gets quiet like he might have fallen asleep Then

JACKSON (CONTD)
You know what I said about that
timeline About how it wasn’t
possible

GABRIEL

JACKSON
Maybe I was wrong My dad was a
great jockey for a little while
His father too My granddad met the
President of Mexico that’s how
good he was

Gabriel finishes his cigarette
GABRIEL
I just wish I’d told you sooner In
Ruidoso Or Oaklawn I just didn’t
know what to say

Jackson is quiet a moment
JACKSON
(without opening his eyes)
You know my first memory of my
pop It was him leaving There
was a big fight with my mom me
grabbing his leg trying to stop
him Him kicking me

Gabriel doesn’t cast his line

JACKSON (CONTD)

It was raining and I remember
sticking my nose against the glass
Watching him Cold glass

(gestures with his hand)
Threw his bag in the car I
always loved the rain Not sure
why

Jackson laughs awkwardly

JACKSON (CONTD)
I ain’t thought about that in
twenty years Not sure why

Jackson gets quiet Clears his throat

JACKSON (CONTD)
I wish I’d known you growing up I
feel like I’ve robbed myself of
something wonderful I just want
to I’m sorry

Gabriel sits quietly Unsure how to respond

But by the look on his face it’s clear it meant the world to

him
GABRIEL

I’ve ate some fish out of here
They taste kind of good

INT JACKSONS TRUCK - LATER

Jackson is driving down the road in his pickup truck

for where he’s headed
He practices a conversation he’s driving toward

JACKSON
Hello Ana It’s me It’s

And again this time with a smile

Nervous

JACKSON (CONTD)
Hello Ana It’s nice to see you I
met our son

He stops Shakes his head Tries it again and again as he
drives along

Jackson rubs his forehead
JACKSON (CONTD)
Fuck
EXT ANA’S HOME - LATER

Jackson steps out of his truck in front of a house in
suburbia that looks like every other around it

He looks down at a piece of paper with an address scribbled
on it checks the number against the house Tosses the paper
in the truck

He starts to approach the house Stops Untucks his shirt
Looks at his reflection in the truck window

Tucks his shirt back in Rolls his sleeves up Checks himself
again

It’ll have to do
He steps onto the porch and rings the doorbell
No answer

So he sits on the porch and waits

EXT ANA’S HOME - EVENING

Hours later as the sun is setting a car pulls into the
driveway and a woman steps out wearing a hardware store
apron This is ANA Jackson’s age home from a long day at
work Carrying a purse and some groceries

Jackson stands

Ana stops stunned Wave after wave of recognition washes
over her face

JACKSON
Ana

It takes her a moment to recognize him

ANA
(confused)
Ummm Hey What are you doing
here
JACKSON

I was just passing through I had a
match race outside of Del Mar and I
heard you was Can I help you
with that bag

ANA

No I’m What are you doing here
JACKSON

I just Can I talk to you a

minute

INT ANA’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Jackson stands awkwardly in the kitchen as Ana unloads her
groceries He looks around at the things that fill the house
The decorations Keepsakes All the little things collected
in a life in one place

JACKSON
So uh you look good How long’ve
you been here

ANA
About thirteen years Fourteen
I don’t know

JACKSON

And youre working at a
ANA

What
JACKSON

(of her apron)
You working at a grocery store

ANA
Hardware Store I’m a manager

JACKSON
That’s great I bet you’re a good
boss

Jackson is looking for things to talk about Ana is making
minimal effort So he just says it

JACKSON (CONTD)
I met Gabriel

For the first time Ana stops unloading groceries a moment
She turns to look at him

JACKSON (CONTD)
He’s a good kid You did real good
by him

ANA
Where is he

JACKSON
A track out in Phoenix

She thinks

JACKSON (CONTD)
Why didn’t you You know I
woulda I woulda liked to have
known that he was out there I
wish you would have told me

ANA
(lost)
Why

JACKSON
Look Ana I know I fucked up with
you I fucked up real bad But I’m
here to own it And I’d like to at
least think that I would’ve been
there for the kid

ANA
Been there for him

Theyre both getting frustrated with each other Glimmers of
what drove them apart are bubbling up

JACKSON
Yeah Like I could’ve taught him a
thing or two Something different
ya know something to keep him from
you know becoming a jockey

Ana is silent She’s piecing it all together Why he came
What he wants

JACKSON (CONTD)
Okay look I know I wasn’t around
I admit that but you didn’t tell
me he was here neither--

ANA
He’s not your kid
Jackson stops cold

JACKSON
What

ANA
He’s not yours I got pregnant
after you left

This washes over him He’s trying to catch up Trying to
process

ANA (CONTD)
I’m sorry you came all this way I
know that’s probably not what you
were wanting to hear

JACKSON

ANA
Listen I gotta wake up early in

the morning

Her voice recedes into the distance as Jackson reels from the
news

CUT TO

INT JACKSONS TRUCK - LATER

Jackson drives in silence No radio Window down His body is
still but monumental feelings play across his eyes

He exits onto a small state road

EXT SALT RIVER - EVENING

He steps down to a river Sits on the bank

He starts to light a smoke But stops

And then

A small group of WILD HORSES step out of the trees on the
other bank They walk into the water Drink from it The

yearlings splash around

They do as they please Their presence is a blessing to him
The river whispers The sun fades

EXT JACKSON’S TRAILER - NIGHT

A squalid party A man is playing some strange song on a
saxophone Jackson has a six shooter and belt on and is
performing for two women like a cowboy

Someone knocks on the door
Jackson opens it to Gabriel

JACKSON
(slurring already)
Well I’1ll be Look who it is
ladies

They don’t seem interested

GABRIEL
Sorry I didn’t realize you were
having a party

JACKSON
Come on in
(to the ladies)
It’s my son Right My son
(back to Gabriel)
The one I abandoned so many years
ago Come hang with us

Gabriel takes stock of him Knows this look

GABRIEL

I’m gonna talk to you later
JACKSON

Talk to me later Talk about what
GABRIEL

Nothing I’11 just--
JACKSON

No no Talk talk talk -- so much

talking Come here Why don’t you
come in here and tell us alla
story with that beautiful
imagination of yours

Jackson has turned dark

GABRIEL
I’m gonna go

Gabriel turns to leave

JACKSON
Go Wait Hey I talked to your
mama

Gabriel turns back

JACKSON (CONTD)
I went all the way over there to
apologize of all things And Why
in the fuck would you do that to
me

GABRIEL
Do what

JACKSON
Come on I mean I’m not your
fucking dad It’s I’m still
trying to figure out what the fuck
is going on

This jars Gabriel The saxophonist has stopped playing The
ladies are quiet now too

JACKSON (CONTD)
Oh I know what it is Look if it’s
money you need I’m gonna hook you

up
Jackson digs out whatever bills and coins are in his pockets

JACKSON (CONTD)
- I got six dollars and thirty--
Look it’s all yours

He tosses them at Gabriel
JACKSON (CONTD)
Keep that you don’t owe me shit

Just come on in here and have some
shots with us man

GABRIEL
I don’t want your money

JACKSON
Come on in

GABRIEL
I don’t want your fucking money

Now Jackson stops

GABRIEL (CONTD)
(quickly)
I thought that my mom was trying to
cut you out telling me some story
I was good with horses and then I
saw you and

Gabriel stops Chokes up
GABRIEL (CONTD)
I’m just gonna leave you alone I’m
not gonna bother you anymore

Gabriel disappears into the night Jackson watches him go

Then he stumbles back inside and slams the door

INT JACKSONS TRAILER - MORNING

Jackson wakes up alone in his trailer The place is trashed
from the night before

Jackson stares at his hand in the light coming through the
curtain No trembles No shakes

EXT RACETRACK - MORNING

Another sunrise at the track This one electric with energy
Jackson watches it all from the rails Completely lost

EXT RUTHS BARN - LATE AT NIGHT

Jackson is in Ruth’s office cleaning out his tack He pulls
his saddle a couple nice bridles He considers his nice
leather halter but decides to leave that for her

As he’s walking away down the shed row someone calls him

RUTH (0S)
Hey Jackson

JACKSON
Don’t worry I’m not taking none of
your shit

He waits for her to reply She watches him decides not to
return a barb

RUTH
So is this how you’re gonna play
it Just sneak out in the night
He turns back to her

JACKSON
I’m not sneaking out anywhere I’m
just trying to save you from having
to say what you were gonna say
Unless I’m wrong

She considers a lot of things to say

He nods

RUTH
I’m sorry Jackson

RUTH (CONTD)
No other jockey worth anything
would even step foot in my barn
but you were always there You know
I wanted this for us

JACKSON
But now that you’ve got one of your
own Can’t leave anything up to
chance
RUTH
It’s not that and you know it
JACKSON
(escalating)

Tell me what it is then

RUTH
I’m not gonna watch you die out
there I’m not gonna--

JACKSON
You won’t race a sore horse but a
jockey

RUTH
Oh don’t start that with me

JACKSON
How many times have I ridden broken
for you Huh Every time I break a
collarbone or a rib or bust my
head I kept racing for you

RUTH
And who drove you home from the
hospital Who gave you horses when
nobody else would

JACKSON
So what is it now huh You know I
can do it That horse knows I can
do it Now what’s the difference

RUTH
Youre afraid That’s what’s
changed

This stops him
RUTH (CONTD)
Man you said so yourself And it’s
okay But
She looks around for the words
RUTH (CONTD)
These horses will run until they
You gotta tell a horse when it’s

time to stop

JACKSON
So that’s it then

RUTH
Yeah

JACKSON
I’m not OK with it Just so you
know
He starts to step out
JACKSON (CONTD)
But I’1ll forgive you one day

EXT BARNS - LATE AFTERNOON

Jackson smokes a cigarette in the morning light Nothing to
do He hears the horses speaking softly in their stalls

He walks through the barns to Dido’s Lament’s stall They
share a moment Both caged in their own way

INT TRACK RESTAURANT - NEXT DAY

Jackson sits alone at a table near the front He’s going
through a barn list of all the trainers Checking off names

noting who owes him a call Who has a horse in the futurity

Gabriel steps into the buffet line starts ordering food

JACKSON
Youre lookin’ right and proper out
there Like you and that horse
finally got your rhythm together

There’s something caustic to Jackson’s tone Gabriel ignores
him

GABRIEL
(to the cook)
Can I have the special

JACKSON
Just don’t stand in her shoulders
so much when she’s trying to open
up Sit back and let her roll

Gabriel ignores that too

JACKSON (CONTD)
When she’s coming out of the turn
especially You’re putting--

GABRIEL
(sharp)
Hey man I got it

JACKSON
Big race Your loss-—-

GABRIEL
I don’t need this shit I got this
horse That’s me

JACKSON
How do you think you got that
horse

GABRIEL

By working my fucking ass off I
broke bones I cleaned stalls I
took shit from these trainers--

JACKSON
Oh and how many stalls does a 19-
year-old clean You busted your
ass for what Four years Three
years

Gabriel can’t stand it He turns back to the woman serving
him

GABRIEL
Can I have some pico de gallo too
Thank you

JACKSON
How long you think I busted my ass
And then giving you a leg up

Gabriel ignores him Starts to walk away

JACKSON (CONTD)
Well I’1l give you one last piece
of valuable advice Don’t fucking
lie to people

Gabriel is gone Jackson looks around Slams his pen down
collects his things and leaves

INT RANDOM BARN - LATER
Jackson steps up to a barn hiding his limp as best he can

A few guys sit around a bucket talking and shelling
pistachios They stop talking when Jackson approaches

JACKSON
Hey Jerry

JERRY MEYER
Yeah What can I do for you

JACKSON
My name’s-—-

JERRY MEYER
I know who you are

JACKSON
I heard you got a horse in the
Futurity

JERRY MEYER
I do

JACKSON
Well if it’s alright I’d like to
ride for you

Jerry Meyer looks at the other trainer like it’s a joke then
he gets serious excited

JERRY MEYER
Well I mean jeez I Hell
yeah man This is crazy I’m
This is just crazy Jackson
Silva

Jerry Meyer leads Jackson down his shed row telling him
about the horse as they go

INT JOCKS’ ROOM - DAY

THE DAY OF THE FUTURITY The jocks’ room is buzzing Even the
jockeys who aren’t racing are packed in the room giving
advice watching the races on the tv

But Jackson is in the back getting ready in a room by
himself

He can barely zip his boot It’s a rough sight

Then the door to the room opens GABRIEL is standing there
dressed in Ruth’s racing silks He gets the whole picture in
a moment

GABRIEL
You alright

JACKSON
Never been better Think I might go
for a run after this

Gabriel forces a smile

JACKSON (CONTD)
You look ready

GABRIEL
I heard you were bad off

JACKSON
Nah I ain’t too bad

Gabriel steps close He tries to say what he came to say but
doesn’t know how He hands Jackson a folded up newspaper
clipping from years ago Handled so much it’s worn thin

It’s an article about Jackson from his glory days From that
paper up in Cincinnati Crossing the finish line ahead of the
horse

GABRIEL
I didn’t mean to hurt you I wasn’t
lying

(MORE )

GABRIEL (CONTD)
I saw this photo and I thought
what if that’s him You know if
that’s where I came from then
Maybe I could be somebody like
that Maybe I could be somebody
worthy of that photo

That strikes Jackson

Jackson

Jackson

Jackson

Gabriel

Gabriel

JACKSON
My dad was an angry man He got
hurt early and caught the Fear
Couldn’t race anymore A bitter
man Only time he’d hug me was when
hed take me to the tracks Id
place the bets for him and hold his
beer But then when them horses
would come racing out of that gate
with the jockeys I’d imagine
them flying off to some other
place Where they couldn’t get
hurt Where no one was scared To
some better world

shakes his head

JACKSON (CONTD)
But then they’d cross that finish
line Pops would slam his beer
stare at me remind me I was bad
luck Then he’d hand me another wad
of cash and have me place some more
bets

chuckles but it is a sad and lonely kind of laugh
GABRIEL
(tentative)
Maybe in this better world I
would have been your son
looks over to Gabriel
JACKSON
There ain’t no better world
There’s just this one
was expecting that
JACKSON (CONTD)
But I certainly would be proud to

call you son

is silent If he speaks he might break

JACKSON (CONTD)
Stay off the rail You’ll win it by
a mile

EXT PADDOCK - SOON AFTER

Jackson steps out to the paddock He sees Ruth talking to
Gabriel on the side

Jackson waits as Jerry Meyer and his barn hand lead Hello
Sunshine up to him

Jackson is mustering some confidence for Jerry Jerry notices
something off

JERRY MEYER
You alright

JACKSON
Hello Sunshine is going to win
Jerry

JERRY MEYER
You really think so

JACKSON
I know it

Jerry looks like he might cry

JERRY MEYER
I ever tell you the story on why we
named him Hello Sunshine

JACKSON
No sir

JERRY MEYER
Well he was born a few days too
late and when he came out we
thought he was stillborn

As Jerry tells the story Jackson stares at Ruth She looks
up at him Everything they never said sits in that look
between them

JERRY MEYER (CONTD)
So we’re shaking him blowing in
his nose trying to get the gunk
out Then all of a sudden through
the stall window this little arc
of sunlight landed on his head
(MORE)

JERRY MEYER (CONTD)
That’s when he took his first
breath
Jackson clasps Jerry on the shoulder
JACKSON
You just stay near the winner’s
circle Jerry Meyer
Jackson gingerly gets a leg up onto Hello Sunshine and they
join the parade to the gates
EXT RACETRACK - SOON AFTER
Jockeys and horses parade around the track before us toward
the starting gates as birds flit in and out of frame
EXT STARTING GATES RACETRACK - SOON AFTER
Jackson is in the starting gates with all the other jockeys
Jackson focuses down the track He wraps the reins around his
hand Takes a handful of mane with his good hand Anything to
get an extra hold

He lets out a long breath And the world goes SILENT Only
the breathing of the horse remains

Then the gates bang open and they fly out For Jackson
there’s no sound except the sound of the horse breathing its
heartbeat the rhythm of its footfall

He gets a good start -- in the middle of the pack -- then
moves the horse up in line

But Hello Sunshine loses steam
One horse pulls ahead
Then another

Jackson and Hello Sunshine keep slipping toward the back mud
kicking up from the leaders

Jackson finishes in seventh place

EXT PADDOCK - A LITTLE LATER

Jackson hops off Hello Sunshine near the paddock Jerry takes
the horse

JERRY MEYER
(half-hearted)
Thanks Jackson
He barely acknowledges Jerry He’s already walking away
Scanning for Gabriel
All the other jockeys who lost are hopping off their mounts
post-race They’re walking past Jackson and the horses swirl
behind him as he looks around
Then another horse is brought around
The winner
Gabriel

Up on the horse like they were made for each other

Ruth runs up congratulating Gabriel congratulating Dido
None of them notice Jackson

Jackson watches as Gabriel is led on the horse to the
winner’s circle

Then he turns and walks toward the jocks’ room and we hang on
his face A myriad of emotions washes across him Relief
Pride in the young man Joy for Ruth

The struggle is over He no longer needs to pretend

He starts to limp heavy as he approaches the jocks’ room now

Nothing to hide

He disappears into the jocks room into a collection of
silks of all colors

END
