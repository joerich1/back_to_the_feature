He was a hero to some a villain to
others and wherever he rode people
spoke his name in whispers

JOHN ALBANO 1972

FADE IN
EXT CAROLINA FLATLANDS - LATE DAY

Heavy raindrops slam into thick gray mud we hear
thunder and the CLOP CLOP CLOP of hooves

Stiff pale FINGERS grimy nails slightly curled into an
aborted clutch leaving knuckle-wide trenches in the
mud

A DEAD FACE drags through the muck sideways cheek down
staring AT the CAMERA with blank eyes forehead half-
collapsed by a bullet impact A BLACK CROW lands on the
head and helps himself to some TARTAR

ANOTHER DEAD MAN this one FACE-DOWN in the mud
dragging just blue ears and a mop of wet matted
hair

A LAST DEAD FACE -- this one staring STRAIGHT UP into the
rain dragging one eye open another just a gaping
hole of goodness

HIGH WIDE ANGLE - STRAIGHT DOWN

A MAN ON HORSEBACK moves with purpose down the muddy
road dragging the THREE DEAD MEN behind him each
Man with one foot roped to the saddle

The CAMERA BOOMS DOWNTILTS UP to reveal a sprawling
desert valley -- and at the end of the muddy road a TOWN
crushed and beaten down by the rain wood buildings
soaked black OUR DESTINATION

EXT STUNK CRICK - SAME TIME

VOICE (V0)
Stunk Crick

The MAN RIDES INTO TOWN a motley bedraggled CITIZENRY
begin to appear furtive grungy barefoot kids
eyeballing the carcasses hookers and drunks bearded
men

The RIDER freezes them all with passing eye contact -- we
see only HALF HIS FACE and this OBSCURED by the shadow
of his hat but it’s a face as grim and cold as the
black clouds overhead No one says shit

The HAT is unusual for these parts -- a gray CONFEDERATE
ARMY slouch-style cowboy lid

Looks like it’s been to hell and back with the dude
wearing it A heavy coat holds off the rain ribbons of
dripping water folding off the edges

FIVE crude COFFINS lean up on an adjacent building -- we
notice a knothole in one of the wooden lids
REVERSE POV

looking out the hole from inside the coffin as the GRIM
RIDER

-» drags his BOUNTY up to what passes for CITY HALL
A GROUP OF MEN come out to meet him

The MAYOR -- 50s short squat slimy

The SHERIFF -- 40s tall thin sleazy

Three hangdog-looking DEPUTIES

MAYOR
Jonah Hex

SHERIFF
(an echo)
Jonah Hex
JONAH acknowledges them with the sparest of nods

JONAH
These the boys you wanted

JONAH steps his HORSE sideways to reveal said BOYS The
rain has temporarily abated -- FLIES light and buzz on
the three CARCASSES

MAYOR
The Clayton boys

JONAH
That’s right

The MAYOR looks them over licking his lips
MAYOR
One two three appear we

have a little problem Mr Hex

HEX’S eyes narrow

( )

MAYOR
They’s four Clayton boys Four of
‘em This only three boys I
don’t see my way that we could
possibly recompense you the agreed
upon recomseption given that the
terms of our ah agreement

As he rambles JONAH unhooks a BURLAP SACK black with
dried blood reaches in pulls out a HUMAN HEAD

and tosses it through the air to land -- PLOP -- in
the mud in front of the MAYOR looking up at him with
dumb eyes The GROUP OF MEN JUMP BACK

JONAH
Motherfucker was too fat for my
horse

The MAYOR swallows thickly

SHERIFF
That’s Portis Clayton okay

The MAYOR gives him a disgusted sidelong look

MAYOR
(to JONAH
ingratiating)
Well now Mr Hex these boys were
no end of trouble to us simple
folk you surely have done us
quite a favor

JONAH
Transaction’s all it was Ill
collect the one hundred dollar
bounty on ‘em and be on my way

A SHARPSHOOTER peeks out from behind the church BELL
TOWER steadying his weighty benchrest-rifle We watch
JONAH and the MEN from his POV

The DEPUTIES rub their palms along the grips of their
weapons

MAYOR
That there Mr Hex was really
more of a er limited time offer
truth be told hundred dollars
is quite a sum in these parts

JONAH
But you’ll pay it all the same

( )

The MAYOR chuckles nervous

MAYOR
Aw hell Mr Hex
(eyes go dark)
There’s an unscrupulous man or
twod pay double that for your
stinking hide

JONAH nods - somehow weary he’s walked this road
before His eyes shift to the row of COFFINS

JONAH
Five coffins

The MAYOR grins motions to the men

JONAH
Well

LIGHTNING FLASHES with the heavy THUNDER rolling in
behind it as JONAH lifts his gaze

In the flash of lightning we see his FACE fully for the
first time

The right side of his mug is HORRIBLY SCARRED a rope
of dermis -- it could only have been melted and healed --
connects the top lip to the chin stretched taut over
snarling teeth like a leather strap

JONAH
That’s a start anyhoo

MAYOR
Cut ‘im down

A shot booms out from the roof of the church whistles
past JONAH’S head and plunks into the mud

The SHERIFF and DEPUTIES go for their guns They never
intended to pay him it was a cold-blooded ambush

With a KICK his HORSE REARS UP on its hind legs

from under the heavy blanket draping down from under
the saddle --

TWO GATLING GUNS DROP DOWN pointed straight ahead

JONAH has the PULLING END of a BELT OF SHELLS in each
fist -- he DRAWS THEM UP and the GUNS BEGIN TO TALK

The shells cut the MAYOR the SHERIFF and the DEPUTIES
IN HALF

JONAH rolls off the side of the HORSE onto the muddy
ground drawing his two SIX-GUNS The MAN on the ROOF is
drawing a bead on him he’s positioned between the
CHURCH BELL and the wood frame it’s mounted on -- JONAH
doesn’t have much of a shot

JONAH squeezes off a few rounds -- THE SLUGS RICOCHET off
the BIG BELL making for a better angle -- CLANG CLANG
-- into the SNIPER’S FACE the first blows off an ear

the second his jaw The SNIPER skitters off the back of

the roof

As the knot-holed COFFIN swings open with a shotgun
pointed directly at HEX taking shaky aim

JONAH throws himself back to avoid the BLAST -- which
misses HEX and cuts an OLD MAN down by his bony SHINS

JONAH RETURNS FIRE knocking the SHOOTER back into the
coffin the lid SWINGS back closed JONAH puts
another shot an inch from the knothole to the right --
where the SHOOTER’S left eye would be and the other
eyeball POPS OUT to fill the knothole (We understand
that the shot has connected with the SHOOTER’S face and
knocked the eye right out of his head)

The RAIN begins to fall again slow at first JONAH
looks around -- the whole TOWN is watching no one else
seems to have any fight in them

JONAH spots a youngish obviously RETARDED GUY in
overalls standing barefoot and shirtless in the MUD

JONAH kneels beside whats left of the SHERIFF and snaps
the tin BADGE from his shirt He walks over to the
RETARDED GUY and pins it to the strap of his overalls

JONAH
Congratulations

He FREEZES THE REST OF THEM with a bladder-loosening
GLARE and SPITS a hock of black chaw at their feet
ROLLS his eyes

» and BLASTS OUT OF TOWN on his HORSE headed for the
horizon

and of his DEPUTIES seven men in all
And finally
500 dollars

END MONTAGE

EXT OPEN PRAIRIE - DAY
A WANTED POSTER blows across desolate TRAIN TRACKS and

STEEL WHEELS swallow it up A BIG LOCOMOTIVE blows by
belching black smoke

INT TRAIN - DAY

In the front cars of the train RICH PASSENGERS sip tea
smoke cigars and play cards

The middle cars are crowded with GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS
mostly in their blue uniforms sleeping in cramped seats

Bringing up the rear are the CARGO CARS rows of wooded
crates marked US ARMY lining the walls More bored
soldiers stand guard

In the FRONT CAR a LITTLE BOY is leaning his forehead
against the window glass looking out over the prairie
He narrows his eyes noticing

SIX MEN on horseback riding in from the distance
throwing up clouds

EXT OPEN PRAIRIE - SERIES OF SHOTS

In a series of JUMP BACK CUTS we PULL AWAY to reveal
miles ahead of the oncoming train under the tracks

Efficiently packed rows of DYNAMITE LOTS OF IT

We JUMP BACK even FARTHER -- a grimy hand rests on a
DETONATOR plunger The train is now just a tiny plume of
smoke in the distance

We TRACK UP TO the MAN’S FACE in profile -- early 30s
stocky hard-bitten with mutton chop sideburns and
intricate black tattoos snaking up his neck This is
BURKE He spits a GLOB into the dirt

EXTREME CLOSEUP 101000 frames per second -- the GLOB
hits the ground in ultra SLOW MOTION FILLING the SCREEN
detonating massively on a micro scale

The SIX RIDERS gallop closer to the train fifty feet
away and keeping pace SOLDIERS gather at the windows
rubbing their eyes are these fuckers crazy enough to
rob a train full of troops

The STEEL WHEELS slam the tracks eating up the distance
to the DYNAMITE

The RIDERS pace the TRAIN making eye contact with the
LITTLE BOY they hold rifles over their shoulders

The ENGINE reaches the DYNAMITE -- Jesus there’s a
SHITLOAD of it

The HAND waits tenses then shoves the plunger down

CUT TO

EXTREME HIGH ANGLE

SOARING OVER the scorched terrain The train is tiny a
child’s toy a soundless explosion ignites the
tracks the front cars SEPARATE AND LIFT OFF the
train buckles tilts

We SMASH DOWN TO INSIDE THE ACTION -- metal screams
twists glass explodes bodies are whipped and thrown
like ragdolls

The TRAIN uncouples cars flip and corkscrew it’s
BEYOND VIOLENT the RIDERS keep pace along side the
chaos

( )

Bodies are CRUSHED TWISTED APART DISMEMBERED the
ENGINE CAR explodes into flame

and then it’s over

The RIDERS canter up to the smoking bloody wreck They
dismount and rip open the broken doors of a CARGO CAR
CRATES spill out and bust open inside RIFLES
BULLETS CANNON SHOT

A SURVIVING SOLDIER struggles out of the wreckage points
a pistol at the men with a burned shaking hand

BANG

A shot puts a silver dollar hole in his skull We
REVERSE to the SHOOTER

QUENTIN TURNBULL -- 50s bearded as hard-bitten a MADMAN
as the West has seen brings down a long revolver

His eyes burn like hell he stands over the grim scene a
leader a black hole absorbing the white hot sun

TURNBULL
No one lives

EXT DESERT HILLS - NIGHT

OPEN FLAME crackling

A CHAINSAW FART RIPS the night silence BRRRRRAAAAAAPPP
The orange flame ripples flares blue

JONAH
Damn

His HORSE snorts shifts against the rope JONAH is
sitting by the fire he takes a big ass Bowie knife
from a hidden holster behind his neck and uses it to cut
open a can of beans

He thunks the knife into the dirt lifts his butt from
the rock it sits on and fans the fumes

JONAH
The fucks your problem Oughta
be used to my ass by now you’ve
been carrying it around for six
months

( )

The HORSE whinnies

JONAH
Equestrian hell is the place for
you

He finishes cutting open the can and scoops the contents

into two aluminum plates then goes into his pack and
pulls out a beat-up box of SALT pours a fucking MOUND

into each plate and stirs it up

He sets his plate over the fire to heat then sets the
other in the dirt in front of the HORSE who gets right
into it JONAH hits a bottle of WHISKEY

JONAH
Need a God damn woman I tell you
Reckon git me down to Cactus Hole
(beat)
Been out here so long you’re
starting to look good to me
The HORSE turns and points his ass at JONAH

JONAH
No thanks I was joking

the ages The fire flutters and GOES OUT

They are IN THE DARK the moon is full the sky a canopy
of stars

She gets out of bed and leaves him there The sound of
HORSES trickles in from outside the window JONAH turns
his eyes toward a sliver of white daylight banging off
broken window glass

EXT CACTUS HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION — DAY

A troop of GOVERNMENT MILITIA is riding into town We
only see them from a distance or in details -- boots
guns swords -- no faces The LEADER dismounts calls
out a DRUNKARD slinking away -- he’d been sleeping it
off in the dirt -- freezes in his tracks

LIEUTENANT GRASS (LEADER)

CuT TO

EXT RED HILLS - DAY

JONAH staggers his horse through stony hills cut from red
rock it’s treacherous terrain -- one wrong step could
- break its leg -- and they are running on fumes

JONAH follows along a crick to a pool of fresh water and
almost falls from the saddle to plunge his head into it
His horse exhausted and lathered drinks ravenously

JONAH brings his face up breathing hard on his hands and

knees He notices something reflected in the rippling
surface and looks up to find it

Across the pool still and unmoving like a chameleon
against the red rock is a crouching INDIAN The
INDIAN’S hand is rested on his TOMAHAWK The two men
lock eyes across the water

JONAH raises an open hand

JONAH
How

The INDIAN says nothing he’s like a coiled rattlesnake
The INDIAN brings his own hand up slowly in response to
JONAH’S -- and flips him the middle finger

JONAH lets his raised hand drift back over his right
shoulder the leather handled KNIFE is holstered
between his shoulder blades just visible from under his
heavy coat

JONAH
I aint looking for a fight
Tonto

Now the Indian speaks -- in his native Apache tongue

APACHE
(subtitled)
I know who you are Jonah Hex

JONAH answers in respectable Apache

JONAH
(subtitled)
Then you know the Apache is no
enemy of mine

The APACHE moves his hand from his TOMAHAWK to the water
he takes a drink When he speaks again it is in
English

APACHE
The white men that hunt you are
very close now

JONAH
No shit

APACHE
I will show you the paths of my
ancestors through these hills
The white men cannot follow

JONAH
Thanks boss but this white man
aint much fer followin’ neither

( )

The APACHE just shrugs shoulders his pack and walks off
JONAH’S HORSE snorts

JONAH narrows his eyes glances back the way he came
thinking it over

JONAH
Fuck it

He pushes on his hat grabs the horse’s lead and follows
the APACHE along the water

CUT TO

INT CAVE -— DAY

BLACK A flint flares a torch blooms and smokes
JONAH and the APACHE are in an underground cave JONAH’S
horse rears back from the flame in a panic JONAH wraps a
cloth around its head covering its eyes after this he
is able to lead it by the rope

JONAH follows the APACHE through the winding tunnel The
firelight dances across APACHE cave paintings crude
childlike renderings of sex torture and mass murder

JONAH
Nice ancestors you got in here

FADE TO

INT CAVE - DAY (LATER)

A shaft of white daylight bounces off the dripping walls
JONAH sees the mouth of the cave ahead -- but no APACHE

JONAH
Where’d that damned Injun get to

He leads the horse toward the daylight The horse is
skittish jerks its head against the rope and stomps

JONAH
Nah I don’t got a good feelin’
neither
Then -- from behind a HISSING SOUND JONAH spins

The APACHE has doubled back behind them He’s got a LIT
STICK OF DYNAMITE in his hand

JONAH
Well Ah’1ll be dipped in shit

( )

The APACHE tosses the dynamite JONAH’S way and vanishes
into the shadows

JONAH pulls the cloth from his horse’s eyes JAMS THE
TORCH INTO ITS BALLS and grabs onto its tail The horse
BLASTS OFF down the cave like a cannon shot with JONAH
dragging behind

CUT TO

EXT RED HILLS - CLIFF - DAY

They break daylight as the dynamite blows lifting them
both off their feet and depositing them in the dirt The
mouth of the cave collapses behind them in a heap of dust
and rubble

JONAH tries to get to his feet but his HORSE pissed off
kicks him in the ass and slams his face back into the
dirt
JONAH

Son of a --

He looks up
They are surrounded by GOVERNMENT MILITIA guns primed

and leveled The cave opens to a flat area at the edge
of a cliff there’s only one other path out and it’s
blocked by SOLDIERS JONAH is fucked
JONAH
‘Guess I get what I deserve

Quentin Turnbull

The name sends a chill down JONAH’S spine pales him

LIEUTENANT GRASS

Turnbull and yourself the US
Government believes that youre

JONAH looks around at the SOLDIERS guns bearing down on
him from all sides assessing the situation

JONAH
You want me to kill Quentin
Turnbull

A QUICK FLASH of hellish violence echoes through HEX’S
brain -- fire screaming and TURNBULL’S face eyes
full of madness slick with sweat half obscured in
shadow

TURNBULL
(voice warped
echoing)
-youre going to watch me take
something from you

JONAH snaps back

A long row of dead fly-ridden bodies all hanged by
stretched necks swing in the wind from a line of posts

Two HILLBILLIES -- ENOS and CLETUS -- are attempting to
rob the bodies ENOS is on CLETUS’ shoulders trying to

naked HEADLESS CORPSE collapse in the mud in a tangled
heap

JONAH
Well ain’t that a picture

CLICK-FLASH a BLACK AND WHITE DAGUERREOTYPE of the

CLETUS points shakily off in the distance JONAH follows
with his eyes -- a distant ESTATE past the edge of town
at the base of wooded hills

JONAH
Hm

He starts his horse in that direction
JONAH
You boys can get on with what you
was doin’
EXT SUGG ESTATE - DAY
JONAH rides up to the modest estate A black man comes
out to take his horse nodding subserviently JONAH

dismounts and hands him the reins

He walks up to the front porch a maid lets him in

INT SUGG ESTATE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

He is met in the vestibule by PHOEBE SUGG -- 50s She is
what youd call a handsome woman something in her manner
speaks to breeding and refinement but life has done her
a bad turn

She walks right up to JONAH with red ravaged eyes --
she’s been crying JONAH turns his face to hide his
scar

PHOEBE SUGG
The balls you got to show your
face in this house you
treacherous bastard

She takes a swing at him he makes no move to stop her --
doesn’t even flinch She slaps his face hard turning it
to reveal JONAH’S disfigurement

PHOEBE SUGG gasps shrinks back her eyes still on fire
with contempt

PHOEBE SUGG
Shit-smelling devil

JONAH
Yes ma’am

FREDERICK SUGG (0S)

HEX and the woman both turn -- FREDERICK SUGG is sitting
in his parlor staring out the window

PHOEBE SUGG
It’s Jonah Hex come around

FREDERICK SUGG
I know who it is I’d like to
speak to him

She shoots a last icy look and retreats upstairs her
maid follows

JONAH enters the parlor hat off and takes a seat
opposite FREDERICK SUGG SUGG just continues to gaze out
the window at nothing with hollow eyes

Flies buzz around JONAH’S head

JONAH
(explaining)
Ain’t had a bath with soap ina

FREDERICK SUGG
Cant keep them out this time of
year -- Please don’t apologize

JONAH

SUGG finally turns to look him over

FREDERICK SUGG
The years have pissed on you
Jonah

JONAH
I come to ask you about Turnbull

FREDERICK SUGG
Quentin

JONAH
You was his friend

FREDERICK SUGG
And his son Jeb was yours

There is something in JONAH’S eyes that speaks to deep
regret but he fights if off He will not show weakness
to this man

JONAH
Ykin think what you want about
what happened

FREDERICK SUGG
We all answer to our own hearts in
the end I believe in leaving the
past where it lies

JONAH
Well Turnbull ain’t lyin’ so good
Son of a bitch is still alive

FREDERICK SUGG
Is that so

JONAH
Thought you might be a some use
illuminatin’ on the subject

SUGG considers

( )

FREDERICK SUGG
The war was a bitter pill to
swallow for us old Southern
boys it didn’t just take
Turnbull’s son from him Hex -- it
took everything His land his
money his slaves his power and
influence his place in society

JONAH
Boo fuckin’ hoo

FREDERICK SUGG
I had my wife my daughter --
Quentin had nothing It’s easy to
see how a man in that position
could slip into madness

JONAH
I just need to know where the hell
I kin find him

SUGG nods looks him over he leans forward -- there is
something desperate in the old man’s eyes

FREDERICK SUGG
(quietly)
I can point you in the right
direction But there’s a bit of
business I’d like to discuss with
you first

JONAH swats a fly squishing its guts

JONAH
Im listenin’

FREDERICK SUGG

The women and girls of this town
have been

(swallows)
disappearing Started seven
months back At first it was just
coloreds saloon trash girls of
no importance but it didn’t
stop and then just three days
ago

SUGG has to stop to compose himself

JONAH
Ain’t you got a sheriff

( )

FREDERICK SUGG
Bacon He’s no use keeps
hanging men but the girls keep
vanishing

He hands him a picture of a lovely young girl pale and
refined with a happy sparkle to her eyes -- ANNALISE

JONAH
Pretty little piece

FREDERICK SUGG
Shes my daughter
(choking back
emotion)
Please find her and bring her back
to me Hex Ill help you with
what you want

JONAH thinks it over studies the picture -- and shoves
it in a pocket

JONAH
Where’s your sheriff stay at when
he aint sherrifin’

INT SHERIFF BACON’S RANCH - CLOSEUP ON SHERIFF’S STAR -
NIGHT

Someone picks a SHERIFF’S STAR up off a wood table

SHERIFF BACON

30s beard mutton chops -- is sitting in front of a
large mirror buck naked He takes the star and opens
the clasp -- a sharp pin glints gold in the greasy light

He pokes the pin into the skin above his left nipple and
slides it through till it pops back out then turns the
clasp locking the badge in place A drop of dark blood
makes its way down to his belly

He turns quickly sensing eyes on him -- but the window
is empty
EXT SHERIFF BACON’S RANCH NIGHT

JONAH leans back against the wall outside the window the
light from inside catching the edge of his face

( )

JONAH
(under his breath)
They don’t make lawmen these days
like they used ta

He backs off the porch and has a look over the place

The main house is a two-story Victorian that looks like
the war tore it a new asshole -- run down the back porch
burned up A big hay barn sits out back sloped copper
roof white in the moonlight

There’s a light on upstairs in the house a female
silhouette moves past the window curtains A flickering
light from behind the barn door too JONAH lights up a
rolled smoke considering his next move

« aS a heavy hand drops on his shoulder

JONAH spins to face what appears to be one big
motherfucker of a ZOMBIE

The thing is 64” and thick eyes blank empty skin a
pale shade of green His forehead is bandaged half
his face is covered in dried black blood and starting to
rot Hes wearing overalls drooling holding a SHOVEL

JONAH slams a kick to the ZOMBIE’S balls -- no
reaction except to swing the shovel and connect with
the side of JONAH’S head -- KLANG

JONAH
Damn it

JONAH pulls out his Bowie knife and buries it in the
ZOMBIE’S ribs The ZOMBIE lets out a long somehow
expressive groan -- not of pain but as though he’s
attempting to communicate something He looks down at
the knife handle then up at JONAH and swings the
shovel again

JONAH ducks it this time and stumbles backward toward ‘
the barn The ZOMBIE trudges after him

JONAH draws his six shooter -- then glances over at the
house and thinks better of firing

No sense making too much noise yet it doesn’t seem like
the thing is quick enough to catch him

Instead he trots over to the barn lets himself in

INT BACON’S BARN - NIGHT

- and latches the door behind him as the THUD of the
ZOMBIE’S weight hits it He has a look around

The contents of the barn speak to all manner of
unpleasantness It’s part workshop part torture
chamber part vivisectionist’s lab a table of bloody
rusty tools -- hand drills hammers augers and the
kicker an old spinning wheel with foot treadles to pull
flesh intestines and muscles into a HUMAN YARN Quite
nifty in fact a rickety wooden chair with rope to tie
the hands and feet and an IRON VICE where the head would
be all lit by flickery oil lamp

JONAH
Yeah

He digs into his pocket for the photo of ANNALISE and
hunkers down to compare the face to the upside down
carcasses on the hooks The ZOMBIE beats on the door
groaning

JONAH lights a match to illuminate a CARCASS’ face
failing to notice movement in the shadows behind him

A steel bucket half full of dried cement comes down hard
on top of his skull he collapses to the dirt like a sack
of spuds letting the wrinkled photo drop we see the
girl’s smiling face in black and white -- then travel up
to the face of JONAH’S assailant

They are the same But ANNALISE is a bit worse for wear
-- there’s an OOZING HOLE in her forehead and her skin
matches the greenish cast of the ZOMBIE’S She shuffles
off toward the door holding the bucket by its handle

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN

INT BACON’S BARN — NIGHT (LATER)

When JONAH comes to he is tied to the operating chair
His head is held in place by the vice it digs into his
temples

The two ZOMBIES -- ANNALISE and the BIG MAN -- wander
around the room aimlessly

BACON sits down on a stool in front of JONAH The star
is still pinned to his bare chest but now he has added a
pair of wool gloves and black thigh-high Civil War
boots

( )

BACON
Hi fucker

JONAH
Howdy

BACON looks over JONAH’S face licking his lips

BACON
Nice scar where’d you get it

JONAH
Farted shaving threw off my aim
(strains against the
vice)
Appreciate the hospitality
friend but this ain’t the most
comfortable furniture

BACON
Oh don’t fret it won’t bother
you long

BACON runs his hand over the table selecting a nasty-
looking hand drill He dips it in oil and wipes it
“clean” with a cloth

JONAH
Seems like you got quite a
deliberate way of doin’ things
around here

BACON seems to appreciate this

BACON
I’ve always believed that trial
and error brings us closer to the
Lords pre-fection

BACON dips his thumb in a dish of black ash and draws an
X on JONAHS forehead

BACON

Drill too deep or in the wrong
places and they’1l up and die on
you But get it just right and
I‘ll be damned if folks dont do
pretty well whatever you tell ‘em
to and don’t put on much of a fuss
about it neither

ZOMBIE runs smack into a wall -- THUMP -- changes
direction and keeps shuffling

( )

JONAH
Don’t know why I never thunk of
it Say brother -- you think I
might prevail upon you for a
slight favor

BACON
Don’t see why not

JONAH
I’d about kill a man for a lump of
chew tobacco right now -- and
seein’ as how itll likely be my
last

BACON
My pleasure

JONAH
Mighty Christian of you Hip
pocket

BACON reaches in JONAH’S hip pocket and pulls out a tin
of tobacco pinches a wad

BACON
Hope you wasn’t plannin’ on bitin’
off a finger or two

He picks up a medieval speculum-type instrument from the
table -- rusty pig iron He uses it to pry open JONAH’S
mouth and hold it that way while he stuffs his cheek full
of the chaw then yanks it out

BACON
Alrighty

JONAH chews it up

BACON
Now I ain’t gonna lie fucker

BACON presses the point of a hand drill into the X on
JONAHS forehead and takes the handle in his fist

BACON
this is gonna smart some

JONAH
Hrmmm

BACON lifts the drill away from JONAH’S forehead for a
second

( )

BACON
Beg pardon

and JONAH spits a glob of the chaw right in BACON’S
eyeball BACON slaps his hand over his eye and collapses
on the floor screaming

BACON
It burrrrnsi It brrrrnnnns

JONAH
That’s what the ladies tell me

The ZOMBIES start to wail and moan at the sound of
BACONS caterwauling

JONAH gathers his strength and lurches backward using
his weight to tip the chair

It hits the ground and collapses into pieces JONAH has
the two splintered arms of the chair tied to his wrists
with rope - one piece has a bent rusty nail sticking
out He scrambles to his feet shaking his legs free of
rope and wood

JONAH gets to his feet just in time to duck -- the big
ZOMBIE swings the shovel missing the top of JONAH’S head
by a spare inch the SHOVEL smacks ANNALISE in the
face sending her stumbling across the dirt like a top

BACON wipes JONAHS tar-black looch from his eye picks
up a meat cleaver spins around in a rage and comes
face-to-face with JONAH

who swings his hand around and punches the splintered
end of the chair arm through BACONS temple The sharp
tip pops out his opposite ear

JONAH pulls his hand free of the rope leaving the broken
wood in BACON’S head He turns on the big ZOMBIE

JONAH swings his other hand the bent nail lodges in the
ZOMBIE’S eye JONAH pulls his hand free -- the chair arm
is lodged in the ZOMBIE’S face blocking both eyes The
ZOMBIE thrashes around in a dumb blind rage

JONAH finds a big burlap sack and pulls it over
ANNALISE’S head cinches up the bottom and slings her
over his shoulder like a bag of feed He grabs an oil
lamp off the table kicks open the barn door

EXT BACON’S LOT - DAWN

The sun has broken the red horizon

JONAH comes around the side of the house to the sound of
banging on the front door

ENOS and CLETUS are standing on the front porch CLETUS
has a burlap sack like JONAH’S slung over his shoulder --
it obviously contains a live gagged human who is
wriggling trying to get out

ENOS
Got another one for you Sheriff
Good one too

CLETUS notices JONAH first taps ENOS on the shoulder
ENOS turns to face JONAH -- he goes pale JONAH’S face
is pure murder

ENOS
This ain’t what it look like
mister

JONAH
‘Course it ain’t

CLETUS drops the sack and takes off running ENOS is
right behind him

JONAH opens the sack Inside is a young BLACK GIRL 15
eyes wide with fear

JONAH
Off you go girl

BLACK GIRL
Thanksya Satan

She takes off toward the road like a rabbit

JONAH hears noises from inside the house looks to the
windows the place is rotten with ZOMBIE GIRLS Maybe
two dozen of them are shambling around inside trying to
get out scratching at the door and window panes

JONAH
Yeah

JONAH slams the oil lamp into the wooden porch The oil
spreads flaring up

JONAH drops his head steps off the deck then turns back
and fires into the windows HEAD-SHOOTING every last
one of them ending their misery

JONAH walks away from the house with ANNALISE over his
shoulder as the sun rises

( )

Behind him the porch is engulfed in flames which begin
to spread up the walls and lick at the roof beams

EXT SUGG ESTATE - DAY

JONAH rides up to the estate with the human cargo slung
over the back of his horse The whole family and
servants run out to meet him

JONAH hands the wriggling gunny sack down to the
servants who begin to untie it MRS SUGG rushes to the
sack and pushes the others back in a panic to see her
daughter

FREDERICK SUGG
You found her

JONAH
Yup

FREDERICK SUGG
I didn’t dare hope

The sack opens -- ANNALISE bursts out green hands
clawing the air forehead oozing a ragged inhuman hiss
escaping her lungs almost a shriek It’s horrible

MRS SUGG is hysterical the servants back away in
horror shock one of them a BIG MAN tries to grab a
hold of the girl

MR SUGG just stares at his daughter numb with shock
JONAH
I‘ll be shovin’ on Thanks for
the assistance Sugg
FREDERICK SUGG
Just get out get out find
Slocum you’ll find Turnbull
PHOEBE SUGG hears this goes even more ballistic
PHOEBE SUGG
I hope you do find Turnbull Jonah
Hex And when you do

JONAH half turns
PHOEBE SUGG

I pray he kills you dead you
bastard

ANNALISE breaks free and tries to get at JONAH hissing
and clawing A VOICE OVER like the ones earlier -- each
with their own take on JONAH’S legend -- plays over
ANNALISE’S blood-crazed zombified madness

VOICE 1 (V0)
Jonah Hex never had much luck with
wimmen

EXT OPEN PRAIRIE - DAY

JONAH rides north following the outline of the sun as it
secrets behind dark clouds The voices continue

American Gothic painting holding a bloody pitchfork A
young plump BLACK GIRL is standing by his side

He was married once to a freed
negro after the war

The picture changes now he is standing in the same pose
by a sturdy peasant-stock CHINESE WOMAN

VOICE 5 (VO)
Naw it was a slanty come over to

The picture changes now it’s an INDIAN SQUAW
VOICE 6 (V0)

It was an Arapaho squaw Everyone

EXT ARAPAHO VILLAGE - DAY

A small Indian settlement in the Rocky Mountains the
pines are laden with snow ‘Teepees and wood fires are
scattered along a mountain stream skins hung to dry and
women working JONAH dressed in calfskin but still
wearing his worn Confederate lid is chopping and
gathering wood

VOICE 7 (VO)

Colorado mountains never bothered

He gives a wink toward the INDIAN SQUAW who smiles
modestly she is simple and pretty

EXT MOUNTAIN TOWN - DAY

VOICE 7 (VO)
One day he rode on down to the
nearest civilized town stock up
on supplies for the long winter

INT GENERAL STORE - DAY

JONAH stands at the front counter Several tables are
set up in the room a half dozen or so local REDNECKS are
smoking cheap cigars and knocking back whiskey JONAH

EXT ARAPAHO VILLAGE - DUSK

The village is a smoking death-strewn ruin JONAH holds
the limp body of his SQUAW bride in his arms shattered

VOICE 7 (V0O)
« he was likely too late

JONAH rears his head back and lets out a bellowing roar
it‘s inhuman like the summoning of an ancient beast
the sound echoes and reverberates through the snow-packed
mountains

which start to rumble Tiny bits of snow break free
and roll it’s only the beginning

Massive mountain walls of packed snow begin to shift and
slide loose -- AVALANCHE

White death thunders down from on high ripping trees
from their roots the MOUNTAIN TOWN and every bug-eyed
REDNECK in it is disintegrated buried

None o’ that ever happened

CUT TO

INT UNION OUTPOST BARRACKS - NIGHT

CLOSEUP a fierce-eyed EAGLE forged of PURE SILVER
gleams in the firelight

WIDEN It is the ornamental handle of a heavy dark
hickory cane -- the owner QUENTIN TURNBULL

TURNBULL stands over a badly burnt UNION SOLDIER -- he
has the pointed end of the cane pressed into the
SOLDIER’S stomach

- the SOLDIER gasps and chokes blood and spittle
oozing from black lips

Behind them the base is in flames TURNBULL’S MEN move
through the dynamited wreckage picking off stragglers
and sifting through crates

TURNBULL looks the SOLDIER in the eyes his face is a
mask of pure sadistic rage He begins to push the cane
into the SOLDIERS gut -- slowly it punctures skin and
keeps going it’s pure agony -- TURNBULL seems to
relish each moment as he impales him

BURKE - the DYNAMITE MAN from the train robbery -- and a
half dozen more of TURNBULL’S THUGS -- approach TURNBULL
they are dragging a UNION OFFICER through the dirt hands
tied

BURKE smirks at the freshly dead man at TURNBULL’S feet
and spits on him as TURNBULL wipes his cane clean

TURNBULL
(ignoring the
OFFICER)
Casualties

BURKE
We lost one -- the Mongrel
never liked him anyway

TURNBULL nods finally looks down to acknowledge the
OFFICER

TURNBULL
What’s this
BURKE
Found one with chicken guts on his

coat

He rips the gold embroidered “scrambled eggs” patch off
the shoulder of the officer and tosses it

BURKE
The soldiers’ families are
quartered on base three score of
‘em Weve got ‘em penned up in
the powder magazine

The OFFICER struggles to his feet
OFFICER
Please kill me if you must
but let the innocents go

TURNBULL pulls out his revolver puts it to the OFFICERS
eye and shoots him dead

TURNBULL
There are no innocents
(to BURKE)
Paint a picture for the ones that
will find this
BURKE grins he will obviously enjoy this work TURNBULL
looks over the ruined base
TURNBULL
Show them what kind of mercy they
can expect from Quentin Turnbull

CUT TO

EXT OPEN PRAIRIE - NIGHT

JONAH rides beneath the full moon The horse is
lathered breathing heavy slowed to a walk after the
desperate charge of the day

JONAH lights a smoke and scans the valley below -- the
edge of a small city is awash with carny lights a big
canvas tent glows from within shadows playing

EXT TENT - NIGHT

JONAH ties up his horse and approaches the big tent
Rusty barbed wire surrounds the perimeter he is stopped
by a pair of stinking ROUGHNECKS with shotguns

From inside the tent comes the sound of a motley crowd in
full froth

ROUGHNECK 1
Dollar to git in

ROUGHNECK 2
And well need to check your six-
guns Misser

JONAH takes it with a snarl He flips the boy a gold
dollar coin loosens his gun belt and hands it over
ROUGHNECK 2 takes it and strolls over to a pre-fab shack
to stow it An OLD CHINESE GUY inside takes the belt and
shoves it onto a shelf with a bunch of others

ROUGHNECK 1 steps aside to let JONAH pass

JONAH takes a flight of rickety stairs up the side of the
big tent pulls aside door flaps and enters

INT TENT - NIGHT
what looks to be a makeshift GLADIATOR RING

The house is packed with the grungiest assortment of
bloodthirsty gamblers imaginable waving money and
raising holy hell The bench seating overlooks a round
fighting area dirt ground covered in blood-caked
sawdust the whole structure seems to groan sag and
tilt with the weight of the leaning spectators -- the
rickety piece of shit could collapse any minute by the
looks of it

Inside the ring two COCKS are going at it ripping out
bloody clumps of feathers

JONAH scans the crowd finds who he’s looking for

Across the way an un-miss-able obese man -- 42 but looks
15 years older beard thick mustache mutton chops --
leans back holding court he wears the hat of a
Confederate officer and a sabre at his side -- COLONEL
ROYAL SLOCUM

SLOCUM is missing his right leg from the knees down he
wears a wood peg

( )

SLOCUM makes eye contact with JONAH from across the tent
-- narrows his eyes can it really be He freezes
swallows heavily

JONAH shoves his way through the crowd making no
friends and sits his ass down next to SLOCUM

COLONEL SLOCUM
(smoldering)
Well barbeque mah ass if it ain’t
Jonah Hex showin’ his pretty face

JONAH
Slocum Been a long time

COLONEL SLOCUM
Not long enuff for fergettin’

JONAH
I aint here to raise the dead

The cock fight concludes -- wranglers chase the blood-
soaked winner around the sawdust while a ringleader holds
up the dead carcass of the loser A cacophony of cheers
and catcalls as money changes hands

The next contest begins upping the ante a muzzled GREY

WOLF is led out chained to the end of a pole

Then from the other side of the ring -- what has to be
the ugliest DOG in history Its mongrel breed is
indeterminate -- some sort of mangy flea-bitten protean
pit bull before there was such a thing its face is
scarred from a hundred bloody battles It immediately
lifts its haunch and takes a steaming piss in the
sawdust

The GREY WOLF starts to go crazy with blood lust
straining to break free of the wrangler UGLY DOG just
plays it cool snarling with a sort of canine contempt --
it clearly doesn’t give a fuck

SLOCUM throws down his bet on the dog fight refusing to
look at JONAH straight on

COLONEL SLOCUM
I surmise you come to pull a
bounty on me Jonah
(with contempt)
That’s your line of work now
ain‘t it Huntin’ down men the so-
called law cant reach

JONAH
I reckon theres some fellas up
north that would pay to see you
hung Colonel But they ain’t
paid me fer it And I ain’t never
had no quarrel with you

Now SLOCUM turns to look JONAH in the eye

COLONEL SLOCUM
Damn it Hex

His eyes brim with emotion buried in bitterness
COLONEL SLOCUM
With ten like you we couldve
turned the tide brought Grant
to his knees

JONAH just grunts now it’s his turn to avoid eye

contact
JONAH
Aint much for coulda beens
SLOCUM shakes his head lets it go he turns his

attention back to the ring where the DOG is ripping the
WOLF a new asshole

JONAH
I’m lookin’ for Turnbull

SLOCUM freezes

COLONEL SLOCUM
Turnbull Turnbull’s dead

JONAH
We both know he never put no
bullet in ‘is ear

SLOCUM considers lying but a sidelong glance at JONAH
lets him know he means business

COLONEL SLOCUM
Maybe not but I ain’t seen the
bastard in a holy spell

JONAH
Seems to me the two of yuh
disappeared round the same time

COLONEL SLOCUM
Way the war ended up didn’t sit
well with some folks

(MORE )

( )

COLONEL SLOCUM (CONTD)
Turnbull more so than most He
was able to keep a good bit of his
money out of the hands of them
Union sumbitches that would’a
looted it He took it and laid
low

JONAH
Where at

COLONEL SLOCUM
No place for long Went on what
you might call a recruitin’
mission roundin’ up fellas --
like myself -- with a bad taste
in us still loyal to the
Republic New Orleans
Kentucky Texas Tennessee
wherever men held a grudge
Turnbull was there to help it
along We had us some grand
designs Jonah I don’t deny it

The “ringleader” of the event is a bizarre character --
“DOC” CROSS WILLIAMS - short squat white hair pointy
ears round glasses face partially obscured by a scarf
crudely embroidered with moons and stars He holds up
the limp carcass of the GREY WOLF the UGLY DOG backs up
against the wall snarling and snapping -- WRANGLERS
closing in

JONAH
Why’d you part ways

COLONEL SLOCUM

Bitterness can do things to a man
Jonah rend his soul surely as a
bullet rends his flesh Turn a
man of honor into a Godless devil

(smirks)
Guess you’d know something about
that

The WRANGLERS clear away bloody sawdust and dogshit
enough under card it’s time for the headliner

“DOC” WILLIAMS steps out and addresses the rabid crowd
DOC CROSS WILLIAMS
This is what you been waitin’ for
you degenerate bastards

The door to the ring slides open The crowd lets out a
collective gasp

( )

A CREATURE is led into the ring hands and feet
manacled with a leather collar around its neck It is
clearly a young emaciated human the victim of bizarre
birth defects and perhaps human intervention feral
bald in fact hairless from head to toe the skull a
spiderweb of blue veins the eyes are blood red
teeth and nails filed razor sharp

The thing knuckle-shambles around the ring shrieking
like a berserk chimpanzee

DOC CROSS WILLIAMS
What is it Man Demon from the
netherworld Or some cursed
offspring from the blas-feemus
union of human and beast

JONAH grimaces disgust masking a stab of pity SLOCUM
continues his recounting as both men watch the spectacle
in the ring unfold

COLONEL SLOCUM
Got to where Turnbull couldn’t
sort between the guilty and the
innocent he talked us all into
a lather ‘bout refightin’ the
war but I could see there
wudnt nothin’ behind it but a
lust to murder to make the
world pay for the pain inside him
I couldnt be a party to it

JONAH
‘Spose we all got a line we wont
cross

COLONEL SLOCUM
Maybe you got a line and maybe you
ain’t I drew mine in
Resurrection City better part of
six months back That’s the last
time I seen Quentin Turnbull

JONAH
Resurrection City reckon that’s
my next stop

COLONEL SLOCUM
I reckon it ain’t

JONAH
Beg yer pardon Colonel

COLONEL SLOCUM

Turnbull might not know the guilty
from the innocent -- but I do

(turns to look him in

the eye)
You as guilty as Beezlebub
hisself Jonah Hex And I shore
as shit mean to see you pay for
it

With that SLOCUM nods to one of his GUARDS and they
immediately grab JONAH by the lapel and -- before he can
react -- THROW HIM OVER THE SIDE RAIL INTO THE RING
JONAH does a complete ass-over and lands hard on his back
in the sawdust wind knocked clean out of him

The CROWD goes nuts hanging over the rails The
WRANGLERS retreat from the side door in the ring’s
plywood walls wrenching it shut behind them the walls
groan creak warp with the weight of the spectators
making a tight seal impossible

JONAH shakes the sawdust out of his ears and scrambles to
his knees The CREATURE is circling him hissing through
razor teeth and flicking its oily tongue JONAH reaches
for his guns - then remembers he checked them at the
gate

JONAH
Lovely

The CREATURE springs at him

JONAH whips the Bowie knife out from behind his neck and
throws it the blade whistles through the air His aim
is true but the thing is too fast it zigs to the side
dodging the blade -- which plants two inches deep into
the plywood wall

The CREATURE keeps coming it slams into JONAH
knocking him off his feet and comes down on top of him
all claws and teeth ripping into him in search of a
vein

JONAH catches the thing with a boot to the scrawny chest
and kicks it across the ring The CROWD erupts more
money changes hands SLOCUM is on his feet glowering
down at JONAH like the judge and jury

The CREATURE is on JONAH again in a heartbeat JONAH
claps a hand over its throat holding back the snapping
piranha teeth The CREATURE is stronger than it looks
and incredibly fast -- it’s all JONAH can do to keep it
from eating part of his head

The CROWD is screaming for blood

COLONEL SLOCUM
So long Hex We can settle this
score in hell someday

JONAH
That’1ll suit me fine

He somehow gets two hands on the wriggling thing lifts
it into the air and -- with an adrenaline charged surge
of strength - throws it straight at SLOCUM and out of
the ring

The last sight SLOCUM sees is the horrible slippery
teeth of the CREATURE as it flies toward him

The CREATURE lands on SLOCUM and goes berserk -- he tears
out SLOCUM’S jugular with his teeth before anyone can
react

The CROWD collapses into chaos it’s like someone dropped
a rabid wolverine into a puppy kennel People are
running everywhere in total panic

JONAH gives the loose side door a kick and knocks it in
off its hinges pulls his knife out of the wall and
ducks through the doorway

The walls groan splinter and finally collapse
spilling the CROWD out onto the sawdust

EXT TENT - OUT BACK - NIGHT (LATER)

JONAH exits out a tunnel to the back CARNIE wagons
carts and cages are staged and scattered

The three WRANGLERS from the ring have got the UGLY DOG
backed up against a wood fence keeping it at bay with

long sticks trying to force it into an iron cage The
dog is snapping and growling back arched ready to die

At the sound of the commotion inside the WRANGLERS turn
to look shifting their attention away from the dog --
and see JONAH HEX striding their direction holding the
big Bowie knife They drop their guard and instinctively
brandish their prodding sticks toward JONAH threatening
him

JONAH SNAPS one of the WRANGLER’S sticks in half and foot-
sweeps him to the dirt The DOG watches JONAH

JONAH
(to dog)
Theyre jus’ jealous of yer good
looks boy

The two other WRANGLERS come at JONAH big mistake

The DOG takes the opportunity to leap up and bite into
the side of one of the WRANGLER’S face latching on The
man collapses to the ground writhing as the dog rips
into him

JONAH walks off

EXT TENT - NIGHT

JONAH walks up to the GUN CHECK shack holstering the
Bowie knife behind his neck

JONAH
I’ll have my six guns back chop
chop

The OLD CHINESE GUY eyes him with suspicion as he lays
JONAH’S gunbelt on the counter

OLD CHINESE GUY
You leavin’ early man

JONAH gestures to the tent entrance which is spilling
over with blood-splattered people climbing over one
another to get out

JONAH
Beatin’ the rush

He takes his guns and straps them on

From behind him two voices come shouting -- it’s the
ROUGHNECKS that took his admission They are running at
him with drawn RIFLES

ROUGHNECK 2

Venilate that sumbitch
The Roughnecks cock their rifles and take a bead on
JONAH

JONAH draws both guns and fires them simultaneously both
shots connect the two ROUGHNECKS now have matching
silver dollar-sized holes in their chests They are
blown out of their boots and land face-up in the mud

( )

JONAH spins around toward the GUN CHECK shack -- the OLD
CHINESE GUY is holding up a Winchester rifle with
trembling fingers He drops it and puts up his hands
terrified

JONAH
Knew you Chinamen was smart

OLD CHINESE GUY’S POV

We see that SUPERIMPOSED OVER JONAH’S face like a
ghostly alter ego a red sweating Chinese DEMON

VOICE 1 (V0O)
He ain’t human I tell ya

VOICE 2 (VO)
Like hell He’s flesh and blood
as you and me

MONTAGE - EXT APACHE BURIAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

Of obscure dreamlike imagery JONAH is tied to a
flaming stake writhing as he burns a white-hot
tomahawk moves through the dark presses into flesh --
smoking searing

VOICE 1 (V0O)
After the Injuns scorched his face
they buried ‘im on cursed ground
buried ‘im alive

The APACHES ride off across scorched God-forsaken
terrain as the sun sets blood-red over a crude dirt
mound the CAMERA SINKS BELOW the earth crust

THROUGH cold dirt white roots and crawling insects
JONAH’S eyes burning with malice

VOICE 1 (VO)
For forty days and forty nights he
laid in the earth food for the
bugs and the squigglies Then one
day a prospector come along

An old PROSPECTOR scraggly white beard wearing long
johns with a half closed poop chute ambles along -- pack
slung over his shoulder poking into the earth with a
dinged-up rusty spade -- silhouetted in the moonlight

EXT OPEN RANGE - CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

THREE OUTLAWS -- the STORYTELLER a SKEPTIC and a DUMBASS
-- are sitting around a campfire at night The
STORYTELLER is shirtless sweating and shivering

SKEPTIC OUTLAW
How you said you know ‘bout all
this

STORYTELLER
Cuz the old fucker told me with
his own mouth what he seen

EXT APACHE BURIAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

We SWITCH TO the PROSPECTOR’S narration when the CAMERA
is ON him

PROSPECTOR (VO)
Make me a good penny in them spots
the Injuns don’t go there much
to bother y’ns on account a
superstition But I ain’ seen
none super ‘bout it so I dig up
what they bury

The PROSPECTOR rubs his scabby jaw grimacing A high-
pitched whistle bounces around inside his skull He
sinks the spade into the dirt

PROSPECTOR (VO)
Gotta trick tooth tell me when
gold is near I started diggin’
n’ that’s when I found Jonah
Hex

The PROSPECTOR is on his hands and knees greedily
clawing at the dirt with his hands he brushes away a
layer of earth to reveal JONAH’S dead face -- blue
putrid roots are growing into his ears and nostrils
and bugs crawl in and out excavating

PROSPECTOR (VO)
Knew there was gold in thar
somewhere M’trick tooth aint
never wrong

The PROSPECTOR is digging a gold tooth out of the back of
JONAHS mouth with a pair of pliers putting his back
into it twisting with all his might -- when JONAH’S eyes
SNAP OPEN

( )

JONAH rises up out of the ground ripping the roots out
of his skull spitting out dirt and bugs

The PROSPECTOR is literally scared shitless he
stumbles away tripping and scrambling SHIT NUGGETS
falling out the back of his poop chute

PROSPECTOR (VO)
Scared the crabapples right out’er
muh bunghole

EXT OPEN RANGE - CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
The firelight flickers eerily

STORYTELLER
Ever since that day Jonah Hex walk
with one foot in this here world
one in the next

DUMBASS OUTLAW
That how he musta got his
preternatural powers

SKEPTIC OUTLAW
Ain‘t no one got preternatural
powers

STORYTELLER
He can see in the dark And he
can track any man matter how cold
the trail by conferrin’ with the
ghosts of dead men

DUMBASS OUTLAW
(voice shaking)
K kin he really do that

Just then JONAH strides in from out of the pitch dark
night and into the light of the OUTLAWS’ fire leading
his horse by a length of rope

JONAH
Shore I can You boys sharin’
that whiskey

The three OUTLAWS’ eyes nearly pop out of their heads
They get the hell out of there leaving their earthly
possessions behind

JONAH shrugs has a seat by the fire rights the whiskey
jug that had half-tipped into the mud

( )

JONAH
More fer me

He sniffs the mouth of the fly-molested jug puts his
head back and takes a long deep hit

INT LUSK MANSION - NIGHT

an empty crystal tumbler comes down onto a deep
mahogany tabletop -- clink

CLOSEUP - THE DRINKER

wets his lips savoring the nuance of flavor

BACK TO SCENE

Opposite ADLEMAN LUSK -- late 40s immaculately groomed
early metrosexual -- swallows nervously and attempts an
eager-to-please smile

LUSK
Over two hundred year-old single
malt scarce as hen’s teeth

QUENTIN TURNBULL sits across from LUSK in a lavishly
appointed study He’s like a dead planet staring right
through LUSK’S eyeballs to his squirming soul

LUSK
You seem a man who appreciates
the er finer things

TURNBULL
Do I
(beat)
I wonder if you understand what
kind of a man I am Mr Lusk

LUSK says nothing He looks like he’d be happy to crawl
out of his skin

TURNBULL has a look around the room

TURNBULL
Quite an agreeable lifestyle
youve earned for yourself since
the great conflict

( )

LUSK
I’ve been quite fortunate with
my investments

TURNBULL
No doubt The war has been very
kind to men like you Lusk
Greedy little carrion birds

LUSK
(shaking his head)
I don’t

TURNBULL
I wonder how they taste -- those
sweet putrescent morsels from the
corpus delecti of our fallen
brothers in arms

LUSK is sweating flustered

LUSK
I’m merely a businessman Mr
Turnbull not unlike yourself

TURNBULL cuts him short

LUSK nods

TURNBULL
(conversational)
You‘re very much unlike me little
carrion bird Ever again compare
the two I might be inclined to
take offense

LUSK
(quietly)
I apologize
TURNBULL
Of course you do

(beat)
Alright businessman lets talk
business shall we

quickly

TURNBULL
There are men of principle and
high ideals in Washington DC
uncorruptible men men who stand
for something other than their own
white asses

TURNBULL pours another shot from the crystal decanter

( )

TURNBULL
You represent the other kind
Lusk The ones that hand out
lucrative weapons contracts in
back rooms over a fine cigar anda
discreet transfer of funds
playing both sides of the game
while good men die and scream in

the mud

(beat)
I have a message for them -- those
fine fatted paragons of
democracy

(leans back)
They work for me now

LUSK swallows thickly his face is like spoiled cheese

TURNBULL
The war isn’t over Lusk It
never ended Our side is getting
stronger every day And when I
come to call at last there will
only be those who were with me
and those who stood against

TURNBULL’S rage is palpable LUSK squirms

LUSK
I’m afraid I

Without warning TURNBULL takes the edge of the heavy
mahogany table and flips it onto its side as if it were
light as a chessboard -- glass shatters everything that
was on the table slides onto the hard floor LUSK jumps
back in his chair terrified

TURNBULL comes forward bringing up the head of his
cane he jams the sharp point of the silver eagle top --
the curved beak -- into the soft flesh of LUSK’S neck
pressing hard enough to choke without breaking the skin

TURNBULL

The hour is approaching little
carrion bird The streets will
run like rivers Make no mistake
this accounting will be settled in
blood Not just theirs -- but
their women their children It’s
a horrible thing to watch the ones
closest to you pulled limb from

agony his legs like rubber

EXT OPEN RANGE -— MORNING

A light dirty rain begins to patter on JONAH’S back his
lifeless hand

JONAH is face-down in the mud the jug of whiskey empty
at the tip of his fingers snoring like a chainsaw

Flies buzz and light off his pitiful carcass as the drops
hit

The three OUTLAWS having snuck back by the pale light of
morning are gathered around him DUMBASS OUTLAW has a
long-nosed revolver pointed at the back of JONAH’S head
the others hang a few steps back cautious

STORYTELLER
Do it We got the jump on ‘im

SKEPTIC OUTLAW
Five hundred dollars split three
ways

STORYTELLER
Thats two hundred dollars each

SKEPTIC OUTLAW
A diff’ernt whore every day for a

STORYTELLER
Two months if they ain’t got all
their parts

DUMBASS OUTLAW
(sorely tempted)
Don’t seem right though shootin’
a man in his back like this
when he ain’t even awake

SKEPTIC OUTLAW
You want him to wake up

( )

DUMBASS OUTLAW
(eyes wide)
No I surely don’t want that

He levels the gun

STORYTELLER
(prodding him) )
Go on

Then -- from behind the three men growling

The OUTLAWS turn The UGLY DOG from the GLADIATOR RING
is advancing on them half-covered in rain mud baring
sharp teeth

SKEPTIC OUTLAW
What in the hell

The DOG springs on them DUMBASS is nowhere close to
reacting in time -- the DOG goes straight for his balls
like a bottle rocket and LATCHES ON

DUMBASS screams the gun goes off randomly hitting
SKEPTIC OUTLAW in his balls Blood explodes

JONAH’S head comes up from the mud one eye open all the
commotion having woke him up

He looks over and quickly sizes up the situation two
guys with blood crotch -- one has a DOG clamped on his
privates in a vice grip ripping into him a third man
the STORYTELLER seems to detect a pattern in all this --
he claps his hands over his package and starts to run
away

JONAH
Fuck me

JONAH pulls out his gun still slurred and groggy from
the whiskey takes a double-visioned bead on the fleeing
man and shoots him in the ass The slug passes through
and out the front ouch

JONAH pulls himself to his feet shaking out the cobwebs

The UGLY DOG rips a hunk of meat free from DUMBASS and
backs away chewing the shit out of it all three men
are writhing crawling screaming in the mud each
holding on to their dripping mangled genitals

JONAH narrows his eyes to get a better look at the dog

JONAH
Be pig stuck if it ain’t that old
carny dog
(to the DOG)
Come ‘ere dog

The DOG trots over amiably snout smeared with gore it
sniffs JONAH’S leg then rubs its head against him

JONAH
God damn dog’s prettier than I am

He reaches down and scratches the beast’s bristly back
ignoring the wailing men the DOG drool-growls
appreciatively

JONAH
Looks like you done me a good
turn dog I’d give you somethin’
to chew
on -- but it seems ya already got
yerself a mouthful

The torn-up hunk of flesh in front of the DOG is
unrecognizable to look at -- but not much doubt as to
what it iswas

JONAH slings a pack of gear over his HORSES hind
quarters pulls the saddle tight and climbs on

JONAH
Thanks for sharin’ boys

He rides away The DOG looks towards the groaning men
farts lifts his leg and pisses then picks up the hunk
of meat with his teeth and trots after JONAH’S HORSE six
feet back

INT LEILA’S ROOM - DAY

An OLD MAN leaves money on LEILA’S bed then
apologetically exits the room leaving the door slightly
ajar She ignores him

Sitting on a parlor stool she looks hard into the
mirror fixing her corset catches herself leaking a
stray tear and stubbornly wipes it away

Her hand rests on the desk drawer’s handle She slowly
opens the drawer and we see a pistol she touches it
running her finger along the trigger then opens the
drawer more and we see rolls of cash

LEILA looks past her face into the mirror -- behind her
in the corner of the room -- a suitcase

OLEAN (0S)
(whispering)

LEILA turns OLEAN a chubby whore peeks into the room

OLEAN

pinch a wad of tobacco from a tin -- we FOLLOW the wad UP
TO sun-cracked lips

Sideburns tattoos it’s BURKE He shoves the tobacco
wad under his lip and scans his surroundings

WIDER

RESURRECTION CITY has seen better days -- the COPPER MINE

that was the town’s reason for being has been quiet for
years an air of desperation hangs over the overcast

sparsely populated main street

BURKE sneers and walks

A pair of scarred-up WHORES are taking a break on a
veranda smoking hand-rolled cigarettes -- at the sight
of BURKE they go pale and hurry back inside He tips his
hat to them sarcastically

-- and almost trips over a KID who didn’t see him
coming

The BOY is maybe 13 with a scraggly mullet dirty face
and one arm

( )

BURKE
The fuck out of my way runt

He kicks the BOY in the ass sending him stumbling then
follows up by spitting a hawk of chew at him the
yellowbrown glob smacks the BOYS ear

The BOY turns eyes slits of murder but does nothing
BURKES fingers tickle the handle of his six gun he
smirks without humor

A trickling sound distracts him He turns to see JONAH’S
DOG looking straight at him from across the dirt road
the DOG has his leg up as usual -- he is pissing on a
horse’s leg

The DOG growls at BURKE instinctively

BURKE gives the filthy thing a sneer of disgust wipes
his lips with a sleeve and proceeds on his way He never
notices JONAH who is tying his horse up to a post
outside the local SALOON just a few feet away

JONAH watches BURKE go taking his measure

The DOG does the same JONAH and the DOG are like twins
But something in the DOGS peripheral distracts him -- he
looks over to see a mud-covered PIG tied to a water
trough

JONAH walks into the saloon

INT SALOON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

JONAH has a look around An assortment of dark shifty
characters populate the place a few spent butt-ugly
HOOKERS eyeing him without much hope a five-handed
poker game going bad

He walks up to the bar keeping his face turned and the
brim of his hat pulled down to keep attention off his
scar The BARTENDER only spares him a brief scan

JONAH
Whiskey

It comes in a yellowed shotglass

JONAH
Hair a th’dog

He knocks it back slow -- like a dying man letting the
rotgut burn his tongue and throat

( )

BARKEEP
Been ridin’ all day mister

JONAH ignores the question

JONAH
Gimme another

The BARKEEP takes the glass and pours avoiding eye
contact JONAH looks him over

JONAH
Colonel Royal Slocum said I might
find what I’m looking for in this
town

The BARKEEP’S hand freezes he spills whiskey on the bar
JONAH takes notice

JONAH
Looks like he was right

The BARKEEP steals a glance at JONAH -- notices the other
half of JONAH’s face -- then averts his eyes

BARKEEP
(quietly)
That’s a hell of a scar mister
JONAH
Too much sweets make my face break

out

The BARKEEP glances up and behind JONAH then hurries
away JONAH suddenly aware the room has gotten silent
slowly turns

Everyone in the place is looking at him

The tension is palpable JONAH seems at ease killing the
lot of them should it come to it Finally one of the
HOOKERS breaks the silence

HOOKER
You come to the wrong town Jim
Dandy

A fly-bitten MOTHERFUCKER standing to her left backhands
her in the mouth sending her to the ground with a busted
lip He glares at her then back at JONAH

MOTHERFUCKER
Its like she said

JONAH
(getting the picture)
Yeah

He drops a few coins on the bar takes a last cynical
look around the room -- and walks out

EXT RESURRECTION CITY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

JONAH hits daylight and heads for his horse the DOG
meanwhile has taken up humping the PIG an old FARMER is
trying to beat him off the pig with his hat

Across the road JONAH notices the ONE-ARMED BOY that
BURKE spit on the boy is standing in a space between two
structures partially hidden staring at him

The boy gestures for him to come over with one hand
JONAH glances around for anyone watching decides to walk
over and see what he wants

The boy backs into the alley JONAH follows

ONE-ARMED BOY
You Jonah Hex ain’t you

JONAH
Whats left of ‘im

ONE-ARMED BOY

ignores this)
Wul ah need you to kill some more

JONAH stops turns This is interesting

ONE-ARMED BOY

He holds out a crumpled wad of bills and coins

ONE-ARMED BOY
Four dollars and seven seven
cents

JONAH hunkers down in front of the boy searching his
face He gently pushes the boy’s fist full of dollars
back down to his side

JONAH

The boy points it out - from where they are the entrance
to the abandoned mine is just visible cut into the sandy
rock hills a ways out from the edge of town JONAH
narrows his eyes

FADE TO

EXT RESURRECTION COPPER MINE - NIGHT

A small shack is built up outside the entrance to the
mine which is barricaded and barbed wired An oil lamp
lights the interior of the shack the mine shaft is dark

Coffee cooks in an iron pot over an open flame out front
TAR BILLY a big black dude -- 66” 250 chiseled --
comes out the front of the shack with a nasty-looking
rifle over one shoulder The firelight dances on his
arms -- dude is cut

(NOTE We may recognize him as one of TURNBULL’S men
from the train robbery)

He tries to pick up the coffee pot burns his hand

TAR BILLY
Smelly cunt

He unzips whips out Billy Jr and relieves himself on
the side of the pot and fire smoke and steam hisses
He’s got a big grin on his grill

From inside the shack

WADE (0S)
That coffee up yet

TAR BILLY
Is up man

TAR BILLY shakes it off puts it away and takes the pot
up the rickety steps to the shack He stops in the
doorway

WADE is sitting on a chair unmoving he is staring
straight at TAR BILLY -- but there’s nothing in the eyes

The handle of JONAH HEX’S Bowie knife is sticking out the
top of WADES cowboy hat

TAR BILLY
Woah

JONAH rips the rifle off of TAR BILLY’S shoulder from
behind brings it down around his throat with both fists
and yanks him off the stairs He uses the gun to drag
TAR BILLY across the dirt by the neck near strangling
him

JONAH

(quietly)
Where’s Turnbull

TAR BILLY isnt having it He backhands the rifle out of
JONAH’S hands and kicks JONAH in the nuts doubling him
over TAR BILLY struggles to his hands and knees

JONAH picks up the iron coffee pot and dashes the boiling
contents into TAR BILLYS face blinding him then uses
it as a club to beat the man’s head into the ground --
CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH

JONAH drops to his knees next to TAR BILLY tossing the
pot aside

JONAH
I said --

But TAR BILLY isn’t moving JONAH tests dude’s head with
a finger poke -- squishy

JONAH
Oops

He looks over to the mine entrance

CUT TO

INT RESURRECTION COPPER MINE - NIGHT

JONAH makes his way down the mine shaft the oil lamp
from the shack in his hand Up ahead he sees a dim
flickering light

The shaft opens into a blown open excavated staging
area Abandoned wood scaffolding gathers dust along the
walls and more oil lamps are hung up on nails here and
there casting twisted shadows

The mine has been converted to a massive WEAPONS
STOCKPILE Rifles pistols mounds of cannon shot
pine crates piled high stamped for various military
departments -- some broken open to reveal freshly
manufactured guns ammo packs of red dynamite

JONAH
Yeah

JONAH makes his way down into the thick of it He puts
down the oil lamp slides the lid of a crate aside and
picks a shiny silver Winchester repeater off the top He
slides his fingers over the barrel admiring it reaches
to cock back the hammer

CH-CLICK

It’s the sound of a rifle being cocked alright echoing
down the mine tunnels only JONAH never cocked the
rifle

JONAH
Fuck me

He spins too late BURKE is about fifteen feet away
with a shotgun pointed at JONAH’S chest

BOOM

JONAH is blown off his feet and into a stack of crates
sending it crashing down He scrambles for cover as
BURKE tosses aside the shotgun and grabs another

BURKE
Bloody Jonah Hex I’d know that
pie hole anywhere

JONAHS chest is sopping with blood -- THIS IS SERIOUS
Two more GUARDS pop out from a shaft in the mine

BURKE
We got ourselves some target
practice gents

JONAH is dizzy with blood loss legs like rubber He
takes a shot at BURKE It’s off but hits a crate of
Gatling shells one shell ignites starting a chain
reaction

Bands of shells writhe around like crazy snakes
exploding in all directions One GUARD aims for JONAH

BURKE
Come on then shoot ‘im

BOOOSHHH A BIG HOLE is blown clear through the GUARD’s
stomach He flops dead on his back bloody hole still
smoking

JONAH
(to Burke)
Doesn‘t look like he got much of a
stomach fer it

BOOM BOOM BOOM TATATATAT TAT TAT BURKE leaps for
cover JONAH lines up the other GUARD but before he
shoots the GUARD’s NECK EXPLODES from a shell

BURKE spots JONAH stumbling toward the shaft entrance and
levels the shotgun at him

BOOM -- a crate next to JONAH’S head disintegrates

JONAH spins pops off a wild shot it ricochets off the
rock wall and hits a dynamite crate -- BURKE’S eyes go
wide

Nothing Whew

JONAH stumbles up rickety steps and toward the mouth of
the mine BURKE climbs up behind him loading his
shotgun patient He has him

BURKE
Im going to bring Turnbull your
balls in a snuff box

JONAH turns to shoot but he has no legs -- and no
bullets He collapses pulling the trigger on an empty
chamber CLICK-THUNK JONAH looks desperately at the
cases of ammo a few yards away

( )

BURKE
Water water everywhere and not a
drop to drink

He levels the shotgun at JONAH’S face JONAH spits
blood flips him the middle finger

Sssssss

The stray bullet hole in the dynamite crate has started
to hiss and seep a tendril of smoke

BURKE
Shite

BURKE is all business He shoulders the shotgun and
stalks straight back over toward the smoking crate

JONAH takes the opportunity to stumble out the shaft
entrance and into the night leaving a trail of blood

BURKE kicks open the crate pissed off smoke billows
out

He reaches in and yanks out a tangled cluster of smoking
dynamite sticks He holds it out away from his face
and walks with purpose back toward the entrance
following JONAH’S trail of blood It’s like he’s taking
a bag of shit to the garbage

EXT RESURRECTION COPPER MINE - NIGHT

BURKE walks out the entrance into the night still
holding the dynamite -- it has started to spark and
flare There is no sign of JONAH unless you count the
stinking carcass of TAR BILLY BURKE shakes his head in
disgust

BURKE gives the dynamite one hell of a heave -- up and
over the hill it spins off into the night sky like a
firework

» and DETONATES in the air

The explosions turn night to blue daylight for a series
of quick flashes lighting up the plains for miles

And in the frozen flash JONAH HEX on horseback riding
hard across the terrain -- face white soaked with
blood

BURKE gazes into the inky night after him eyes burning

DISSOLVE TO

EXT HILLS - MORNING

The cold stinking rays of the sun creep across the
hills filtering through the trees at the edge of the
deep woods like dirty water through drain slats

JONAH’S horse has slowed to a walk lathered and panting
JONAH is slumped over undead dark blood caked to
molasses from chest to knee his face is so pale it’s
almost blue he shivers uncontrollably

The DOG is trotting along fifteen feet behind JONAHS
horse the horse drops periodic road apples in its path
like green land mines

JONAH’S hand loosens on the rein his eyelids flutter
and HE FALLS OFF landing like a bag of cement on the
hard-packed dirt

The DOG comes up sniffs JONAH’S ass slobbers all over
his face

JONAH comes to -- shoves the dog away half delirious

JONAH
Least wait ‘til Im dead to eat
me

He struggles to his feet The dog just stands there
watching his very move

JONAH
Listen here dog -- fuck off

The dog regards him blankly slobbering

JONAH
Anyone rides with me’s bound to
end up dead sooner or later
understand

JONAH pulls his gun and pokes it toward the dog’s skull

JONAH
I said skedaddle you stupid
beast

JONAH advances on the dog with rubber legs summons the
strength to plant a kick in its ribs The dog growls and
snaps at him baring its teeth

JONAH

Get outta here find y’ns a
bitch and multiply

( )

JONAH bares his teeth back at the dog The dog backs up
a few paces he fires a shot into the dirt in front of
it the dog turns and trots a few yards away

JONAH
Go on GIT

He fires again The dog takes a last look back unsure
and then bails

JONAH
(to himself)
Don’t need nothin’ watchin’ me
die

He watches the dog until it disappears around the base of
the hills holding the gun out shakily

« then falls flat on his back in the dirt

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN

Brown hands take hold of JONAH’S unconscious body and
drag him through the dirt

-- into the woods under the shadows of trees

Still dragging JONAH’S eyelids flutter attempt to
focus he sees shafts of white light moving filtering
down through the branches like beams from heaven

« and the silhouettes of long-haired feathered heads
like strange bird-men peering down

FADE TO BLACK

INT INDIAN SWEAT HUT - TIME INDETERMINATE

By obscure flickering fire-light JONAH’S clothes are
stripped his bloody wounds cleaned and rinsed the
water makes steam when it hits his flesh -- it’s like a
damned oven in here he is slick with sweat

Old Indians begin to chant rhythmically -- in a shadow

thrown on the sloping mud wall by the dancing flame we

see one of the Indians whip out his hog and piss into a
clay pot clouds of steam billow

( )

Mud herbs crushed petrified bat crumbled to flakes
are added in and mashed into a paste then caked thick
over JONAH’S shredded chest

JONAH’S eyes fly open -- all white no pupils an
unholy gasp escapes his lips

» and in the shadows on the wall we see snaking
demonic wraithlike shapes like wisps of smoke
flying out of JONAH’S mouth and evaporating

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
INT INDIAN SWEAT HUT - TIME INDETERMINATE (LATER)

JONAH sleeps his breath is deep raspy he is soaked
in sweat a black snake slithers across his throat his
face

OLD INDIAN
(subtitled)
His brain is rotten
vengeance violence loss too
deep for one man to bear

JONAH writhes as if beset by nightmares or demons

OLD INDIAN
(subtitled)
But his soul is strong his
work on this earth is not
finished

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
EXT WOODS - DAY

JONAH stumbles through the cold woods -- lost alone
haunted He is ghostly pale but his eyes have fire
The blood-soaked clothes he was shot in are dried black
as tar

He leans against a tree to steady himself checks his
guns -- theyre both loaded

Broken sunlight makes him look up -- a swarm of BLACK

CROWS tracks across the sky heading somewhere the sky
is full of them

JONAH holsters his guns and follows their direction

The sound of gunfire cannons screaming and dying echoes
through the woods JONAH runs through the trees toward
the white daylight finally reaching the edge of the
woods

EXT HILLTOP - DAY

JONAH stands at the treeline on a hilltop he is
overlooking a BATTLEFIELD

Hundreds of UNION and CONFEDERATE soldiers are squared
off against one another in the heat of combat -- it’s a
scene right out of the Civil War

Crude trenches fortified with wood planks and barbed
wire run along the perimeter the grassy meadow is
strewn with bodies

Cannon and gunfire pins down the enemy at opposite
ends while soldiers caught in the crossfire fight hand-
to-hand in the middle with rifle stock and bayonet

JONAH advances down the hill towards the Confederate
trench -- with his hat and jacket he fits right in

As he moves down toward the battle he becomes aware of
vague shadowy figures trudging past him towards the
woods at a closer look they appear to be the GHOSTS
of fallen soldiers Their expressions are shocked
ashen one makes curious eye contact with JONAH as he
passes

JONAH shakes the cobwebs out of his head rubs his eyes --
the ghosts are not quite there anymore was it just
smoke

A deafening explosion knocks JONAH into a crouch dirt
rains on him He jumps down into a trench for cover

A BLACK SOLDIER spins points his gun in JONAH’S face
almost pulls the trigger -- then sees JONAH’S hat and
exhales

JONAH
What the hell’s going on here
boy

BLACK SOLDIER

Got dem Yanks penned in and we
lettin’ it rip

JONAH
That’s all hunky dorey friend
There’s just one problem

BLACK SOLDIER
Whats that

JONAH
The God damn war’s been over for
six years

The SOLDIER starts to chuckle then looks in JONAH’S eyes
and sees something that seems to chill him to the bone

Another cannon hit rocks the trench and breaks the moment
-- the SOLDIER scurries away with a paranoid backward
glance

JONAH grabs the nearest shoulder and spins it around
YOUNG BLACK 22 not a soldier -- overalls no shirt
shoes

JONAH
Whos in charge here

The YOUNG BLACK looks JONAH up and down with wild eyes
clearly terrified turns and goes running off

JONAH continues down the trench He passes dying men
holding in their guts in agony bullets zing and whistle
past his head

A half-dozen YANKEES pile over the trench wall twenty
feet ahead and get into it like wild dogs with a group of
GREYBACKS shoving bayonets into each other and firing
rifles point blank -- by the time JONAH gets to them they
are all dead or dying JONAH steps past the tangled
groaning bodies and keeps going

He spots a SOLDIER up on a crate peering over the ridge
of the trench barks at him

JONAH
You in charge

SOLDIER
Ain’t you

Past the SOLDIER’S head up on the smoke-obscured
battlefield JONAH picks out the commanding officer by
his uniform He is holed up behind a barricade with
several infantrymen shouting out orders all the men
are black JONAH climbs up over the ridge and trots over
to him keeping his head low

( )

The officer -- CAPTAIN GEORGE AUGUST HIBBERT -- looks to
be in his early forties a caramel-skinned black man with
piercing green eyes and a touch of premature grey in his
beard and mutton-chop sideburns His intensity is scary

JONAH
You the captain of these men

HIBBERT looks JONAH up and down

HIBBERT
Captain George August Hibbert
Fort Hill Confederate Negro
Infantry Brigade
(cold with dignity)
I expect youve come to relieve me
of my command

JONAH
I aint got authority to relieve
you of jack shit boss

HIBBERT’S eyes are like glass -- he stares into the
distance at nothing it’s as if he expected as much

JONAH
Dont mind my askin’ though --
what the hell kind of command is
this

HIBBERT
I received my commission from
Stonewall Jackson himself He
promised freedom for me and my
men should we prevail

JONAH
Stonewall’s dead brother

This gets HIBBERT’S attention

HIBBERT
(suspicious )
Who you said sent you

JONAH
I aint sent from nowhere God
damn it Im tryin’ to tell you
that Old Stonewall been toes up
since 1863 shot in the dark by
his own men Fucker’s six feet
under Virginia dirt -- ‘ceptin’
his left arm which got cut off n’
buried up Spotsylvania

( )

HIBBERT is looking him up and down studying him like you
might check a turd for corn

HIBBERT
And maybe that’s true

HIBBERT pulls out his pistol and levels it at JONAH’S
forehead

HIBBERT
« and maybe you just a Yankee
spy sent to demoralize and
undermine my command

HIBBERT’S voice is quiet amidst the cannon and chaos but
his eyes burn with solar intensity and he is practically
shaking with bottled rage

JONAH throws up his hands in exasperation

JONAH
Aw fer fuck’s sake

He takes hold of HIBBERT’S gun hand and presses it to the
scar side of his face

JONAH
Do me a favor friend don’t
Miss I done waited long enough
ta get out of this shit circus

A small group of SOLDIERS are gathered close attention
glued to HIBBERT and HEX despite the battle all around
HIBBERT cocks the hammer back JONAH stares him down
HIBBERTS finger tightens on the trigger - JONAH doesn’t
flinch

All at once the rage seems to drain out of HIBBERT his
body relaxes eyes glaze over -- he stares out across the
battlefield

HIBBERT
We all done waited

The battle sounds take on an eerie quality like the
whisper of clouds -- the screams of the dying and
concussion of distant gunfire echo and fade

HIBBERT
Ive waited too Sometimes I
think we’ve been out on this field
forever killin’ the same Yanks
over and over but they won’t
stay dead Nothin’ stays dead

( )

JONAH
Yeah well -- they’re likely
sayin’ the same about you fellas

HIBBERT gathers himself the fire and brimstone is back
in his eyes He looks around at the exhausted
bedraggled SOLDIERS gathered all around

HIBBERT

IT ENDS NOW MY BULLY BOYS AFTER
TODAY WE GONNA BE FREE BROTHAS
OR WE GONNA BE DEAD BROTHAS THEM
YANKEE MUTHAFUCKERS BE DAMNED --
WELL SHOW ‘EM WHATS FOR AND
FLOOD THIS BARREN SOIL WITH THE
HOT RED BLOOD OF THEIR CHESTS

The men let out a whoop and hollar As HIBBERT speaks
the sounds of battle creep back in CANNON-FIRE
punctuating his words

HIBBERT

DONT YALL WANNA BE FREE

(a ROAR of

affirmation)
THEN STUFF YOUR SOUL IN ONE
POCKET YOUR BLACK BALLS IN THE
OTHER PICK UP YOUR RIFLE -- AND
CHARGE NIGGAS CHARGE

HIBBERT has worked the men into a frenzy They grab up
their weapons and go bailing up over the trenches
charging with bayonets HIBBERT draws his sword and
takes off full barrel towards the unseen enemy

They are immediately met by a hail of Yankee ordnance --
one out of three are cut down in gruesome fashion
knocked to bits and pieces by bullets and cannon balls
HIBBERT sprints forward undaunted - nothing touches
him

JONAH shrugs good a day as any to die

JONAH
Fuck it

He draws both revolvers and charges into the fray
unloading blazing hell

HIBBERT and the surviving BRIGADE reach the foremost
Yankee positions and go plowing through HIBBERT is
chopping Yanks up with his sword left and right JONAH
is right behind him blasting UNION SOLDIERS in the face
at close range and contributing much chaos

( )

the two madmen share a moment of crazed eye contact in
the middle of everything delirious with blood

aS a CANNONBALL comes swooping down from the distance
-- coming up fast on JONAH from his blind side --
puncturing the white sky HIBBERT spots it but it’s too
late for anything but a split second of realization --

BOOM

A massive blast JONAH is blown off his feet and showered
with debris A cloud of smoke consumes him as chunks of
dirt and human appendages rain from the sky And then

Black Dead silence

JONAH blinks slowly letting his tear ducts wash the dust
from his eyeballs He shakes scorched dirt off his face
and struggles to his hands and knees looks around

The field is EMPTY there are only the long decayed
bones of a battle years before remains half-buried in
the mud grown over with grass and weed The swarm of
BLACK CROWS are now feasting in the mire The sound of
the crows’ calls is all that breaks the perfect silence

JONAH scans the horizon for any sign of human life He
finds nothing -- except

Thirty yards away the YOUNG BLACK dude that ran from him
earlier is wandering through the long dormant
battlefield looking dazed and disoriented He spots
JONAH and FREEZES

They are the only two living humans for what must be
miles

The YOUNG BLACK -- ALVIN -- shuts his eyes tight rubs
them then opens them wide -- checking to make sure JONAH
is really there

Then from off in the direction of the hillside a
familiar SNORT JONAH looks -- his HORSE is standing at
the base of the hill

JONAH
Ill be buggered

car -- suitcase pressed against her knees -- travelling
cheap She watches the world pass by out the window

“DOC” CROSS WILLIAMS - head bandaged brown caked on
blood staining the cloth arm in a sling -- sits next to
her shoulder to shoulder She tries to ignore him but
it ain’t easy “DOC” repeatedly swats at flies who won’t
leave his wounded scalp alone

DOC CROSS WILLIAMS
Afternoon ma’am

LEILA
Not much in the mood for
conversation if y’don’t mind

DOC CROSS WILLIAMS
Nope don’t mind at all

He smears fly guts on his suspenders

DOC CROSS WILLIAMS
Headed all the way to N‘awlins

LEILA turns to look him in the face he’s disgusting
All the same she’s seen worse

LEILA
That’s right

DOC CROSS WILLIAMS
As am I sweetheart As am I
Make a new start for myself in the
jewel of the South

She turns away blowing him off He reaches down into
his pants up to his elbow for no particular reason

DOC CROSS WILLIAMS
Ran into a little trouble up there
Alabammmy business went belly
up it did But I’1l be back

He pulls out his hand produces a dirty unmarked bottle
of greenish brown liquid uncaps it and proceeds to
pour it on his head bandages

LEILA wrinkles her nose presses herself against the
window -- the shit stinks

DOC CROSS WILLIAMS
My own invention Doc Cross’
‘Sweet Brown’ Tonic Cure

He grins strangely sliding a snakelike tongue over
jagged yellow teeth

DOC CROSS WILLIAMS

LEILA turns back toward the window

JONAH

JONAH jumps off his horse runs right up to a UNION
GUNNER shoves the bayonet at the end of his rifle to the

Quentin Turnbull’s brand was what
you might call a Southern
Institution It meant pride
money power tradition

rightly want It was the only
world Jeb ever knew Hell I
couldnt think less of ‘im for it

FLASHBACK - EXT CONFEDERATE HIDEOUT - NIGHT

COLONEL SLOCUM beats the hell out of a slave who dropped
a coffee pot while JONAH looks on steaming

JONAH (V0)

started to learn me a different
point of view Got to where I
just couldn’t fight no more for
what we was fightin’ for But
wudn’t no way Id ever turn to
fire on these men that were like
my own brothers

JONAH steals away from the camp by moonlight JEB
TURNBULL wakes up and watches him go he says nothing

JONAH (VO)
So I took me a French Leave one
night Figgered Id march myself
to the nearest Union post and sit
out the war in a prison cell
Fort Jackson Louisiana it was
not a day’s ride from New Orleans

EXT FORT JACKSON - DAY JONAH is immediately grabbed by the BLUES as he crosses
into FORT JACKSON holding his hands over his head and
carrying a white flag in his teeth

JONAH (V0O)

Seems like our unit were a
particular thorn in the side of
them boys no less than Ulysses
Grant himself ordered that they
was to find where we was hidin’
out no matter what it took

JONAH is being beaten and whipped He sucks it up but
the pain gets the best of him and he starts to fade

The UNION SOLDIERS swarm the Confederate hideout
catching them half asleep They violently drag the
GRAYBACKS from their tents and sleeping rolls beating
down and pig-sticking any who resist

JEB TURNBULL gets a hold of a BLUE and snaps his neck
before taking the butt of a rifle to the face and
dropping like a stone

JONAH (VO)
They never had no chance at all

The CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS are dragged into a red muddy
field and lined up chained together by the wrists They
are on their knees -- bloody bedraggled some still in
their long johns

The UNION SOLDIERS surround them outnumbering the GRAYS
three to one JONAH HEX is shoved forward to face his
former brothers-in-arms

JONAH (VO)
The Yankee CO did me the favor
of thanking me for my assistance
right in front of all of ‘em

SLOCUM glowers at HEX with murder in his eyes JEB
TURNBULL is right beside him we see in JEB’S eyes that
he refuses to accept it

COLONEL SLOCUM
(spittle flying)
DAMN YOUR SOUL TRAITOR

The UNION COMMANDING OFFICER grins easily amused speaks
quietly into the ear of one of his men

UNION CO
Let the one with the stripes
live -- we can trade ‘im fer 10 of

our boys

JONAH (VO)
They wouldnt even waste the
bullets on us Rebs

The UNION SOLDIERS lead a dozen BLACK SLAVES up to the
chained GRAYBACKS each one is holding a heavy rock with
both hands -- they look terrified

JONAH (VO)
They made them poor colored folks
do their killin’ for ‘em

The UNION SOLDIERS hold RIFLES to the SLAVES’ heads
Against their will the SLAVES are forced to SMASH IN THE
SKULLS of the GRAY PRISONERS

JONAH turns ALVIN is slumped over dead on his horse
No telling how long

JONAH slows to let the old nag catch up as it passes
we see that the man’s back is a bloom of soaking crimson
a not-so-imaginary wound from the imaginary battle And
JONAH sees something else

He grabs hold of ALVIN’S shoulder and pulls his limp
torso closer On his back a brand is burned into the

boys skin -- the scar seems years old

What looks to be the gnarled shoulder bone of a bull hits
dirt

The UGLY DOG trots over and picks it up with slobbery
teeth then runs it back to the ONE-ARMED BOY that threw
it

ONE-ARMED BOY
Give it here dog

The BOY takes a hold of the bone the DOG pulls back
growling viciously and offering some playful resistance
before letting go

ONEARMED BOY
Alright now git it

The BOY lets it fly The DOG skedaddles after it
chasing the dust the bone skitters to a stop in front
of a pair of boots As the DOG trots up a black shadow
falls on him he looks up

QUENTIN TURNBULL a towering silhouette in the late day
sun looks down on the dog with contempt He has BURKE
and another ROUGHNECK backing him up

The DOG snarls shows teeth then turns his haunch toward
TURNBULL lifts a leg and pisses on his boots

TURNBULL kicks the DOG away it spins growls crouches
to spring

ONE-ARMED BOY
Dog NO

TURNBULL gets a grip on his eagle-top cane and brings it
down hard on the DOG’S skull THOK

The DOG shakes his head clearing out the little birdies
grabs the end of the cane in his teeth and rips it from
TURNBULL’S grip He CRUNCHES down on it

The BOY runs toward them as TURNBULL pulls a long pistol
from an ornate holster at his side

ONE-ARMED BOY
Give it back Dog

TURNBULL aims and fires two slugs into the DOG’S ribs
knocking it back in the dirt BURKE finds this
hilarious

ONE-ARMED BOY
Stop it

The DOG clearly hasn’t figured out it’s dead yet It
drops the cane and advances on TURNBULL with unsteady
legs

TURNBULL puts a boot to the DOG’S neck and forces it
down he pushes the DOG’S snout into the dirt inserts
the business end of the pistol into the DOG’S ear and
pulls the trigger

BOOM

TURNBULL brushes off his pant leg as the ONE-ARMED BOY
collapses in tears next to the dead DOG wrapping his arm
around it and pressing his face into the flea-bitten fur

TURNBULL
‘Gentlemen

They walk on

men are at work stacking and dragging

TURNBULL
Explain it to me again Burke

( )

BURKE
There is no bloody explanation for
it I gave the cocksucker two
barrels straight in his chest By
all rights he should be dead as
Tar Billy here

TURNBULL
(steaming)
Hex doesn’t know how to die He
will have to be educated

TURNBULL lets the lid of the long crate drop closing up
the makeshift coffin

BURKE
I’‘ll be happy to continue his
lessons should he show his
beautiful face again -- but I must
say I find it highly unlikely
Ask me he’s rotting in some
trench somewhere white as a stuck
pig

TURNBULL
He’s alive

TURNBULL instinctively rubs a patch of shiny burnt tissue
on the knuckles of his right hand

TURNBULL
And somehow the son of a whore
knows I am too He’ll be coming

BURKE
Peachy Let him

TURNBULL gives BURKE a look sizing him up -- be careful
what you ask for

TURNBULL
This location is compromised
Have the cream of it loaded onto
the trains and dynamite the rest

BURKE
Right

TURNBULL moves to the next long crate shoves aside the

An INBRED-LOOKING SOLDIER clicks a burning O-ring onto
the nozzle of a crude hose attached to a tall barrel of
oil Another SOLDIER hand-pumps pressure into the
barrel

INBRED pulls the lever on the hose -- improbably the
piece of shit works a thirty-foot jet of flame shoots
out from the nozzle knocking INBRED back and curling his
eyebrows

He struggles for a two-handed grip and aims it ata
STUFFED DUMMY with a DEER’S HEAD In seconds the DUMMY
is toasted black and the deer head falls to the ground
burnt to the bone

JONAH

I kin see why you’d invent such a

Soon enough gunslingers like

part Asian part Indian part Caucasian part whatnot --
we remember him from the train robbery Face sweaty
beaten and bruised a rag stuffed in his mouth

LIEUTENANT GRASS

Turnbulls boys paid a visit to
one of our outposts a few days
back eighty-eight men women
and chil’n killed on our side --

(nods toward MR

MONGREL)
All we got is this one They left
him for dead

JONAH studies the SCRAGGLY-HAIRED DUDE

JONAH
Mind if I have a little talk with
‘im

LIEUTENANT GRASS
Believe me Hex he already told
us all he knows We can be very
persuasive as you oughta rightly
know

JONAH
Sure he did But if it’s all the
same to you

LIEUTENANT GRASS
(with bile)
Be my guest

JONAH takes a walk over to the target board passing the
SOLDIERS on the way When he gets there he is out of
earshot of GRASS EVEN and the others JONAH greets MR
MONGREL with a grin

JONAH
(friendly)
Howdy

then flips the board back around making sure they’1l
be out of sight as well

A few moments pass GRASS and EVEN glance at one another
uncomfortably EVEN shrugs

A couple more INBRED types wheel a funky-looking
OVERUNDER CANNON up to take the place of the Gatling
Gun One of the men kneels behind it attempting to line
up a shot at the naked lady

( )

Finally JONAH appears from behind the target He walks
back toward GRASS and EVEN

JONAH
Yup Springfield it is Nice bit
of interrogatin’ boys

GRASS’ eyes narrow

JONAH
Guess you don’t owe me nothin’ on
account of it was you fellas that
worked it out

JONAH starts to leave glances at the OVERUNDER CANNON
then at the target it’s pointed at then back at
the cannon cock-eyed He gives the barrel a kick re-
aiming a few inches to the right then another a few
inches up satisfied dips his hat to EVEN and the
others

JONAH
Reckon were all square

and walks off toward the big sliding doors

LIEUTENANT GRASS
(calling after him)
Don’t you disappear bounty
hunter We ain’t done with you
yet

The CANNON INBRED checks JONAH’S aim shrugs and lights
the fuse -

B-BOOM Two cannon balls go sizzling across the barn
both make contact the NAKED LADYS HEAD and CROTCH are
now smoking cannon holes

GRASS takes this in then turns to watch JONAH leave
suspicious He nods toward EVEN

LIEUTENANT GRASS
Get the word out -- anywhere Hex
shows his face I want to know
about it
(beat)
Wherever that fucker is -- that’s
where we’ll find Turnbull

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
EXT NEW ORLEANS - DAY

A DRUNK stumbles through the street rambling
incoherently in deep Creole patois He leans against a
post

White bird-shit hits his head and drips down his face
He slurs a mouthful of Creole which we are courteous
enough to subtitle

DRUNK
Shit

Several floors up seagulls perch on an ornate French

Creole-style balcony in the bg clipper ships tool

along Lake Pontchartrain the ports are clogged with
chaos and industry

EXT REBEL TAVERN LATER
A well-worn Confederate flag hangs over the entrance to a
seedy establishment at the end of a claustrophobic cul-de-

sac A hand-carved sign reads just

“WHISKEY”

JONAH ties his horse up to a post nearby and takes in the
place with dark eyes His horse kicks at the one next to
it ornery

JONAH
Settle down damn you

A PLUMP RED-HEADED WOMAN 20s runs out the front door
in tears followed by a red-faced barrel-chested FELLA
in a stained white undershirt he stops in the doorway

FELLA
Gitchyer fire-crotch back in here

JONAH pushes the FELLA aside

FELLA

JONAH

JONAH pulls his hat down low and shoves past him into the
bar

INT REBEL TAVERN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Simple dive bar with old wooden chairs and tables a
burnt-up Union Blue uniform nailed up to the wall
Confederate swords flags etc -- a painted portrait of
ROBERT E LEE holds a place of honor above the liquor
bottles Yes these are the bitter fuckers that lost the
war

A few dozen patrons sit in little bunches mumbling and
yacking at one another and slamming rotgut

JONAH with his grey coat and slouch seems to fit right
in he bellies up to the bar The YOUNG EYE-PATCHED
BARTENDER wipes the bar down in front of JONAH

JONAH
Got me a thirst that won’t quit

EYE-PATCH BARTENDER
(looks him over)
Look like you come to the right
place

EYE-PATCH fills a shot glass and sets it in front of
JONAH who slams it back EYE-PATCH quickly pours
another JONAH quickly drains it This continues for 5
more shots

JONAH shakes out the spiderwebs lets the whiskey rock
him back

JONAH

CUT TO

EXT REBEL TAVERN - DAY (LATER)

JONAH pushes out the front he still has his legs under
him but he’s seeing double --

A double flash of black tattoo through the street traffic
in his peripheral vision sobers him up quick he ducks
away from the entrance and around a brick corner peering
back stealthily in time to see

BURKE crossing the road and making his way to the tavern
entrance a second earlier and they would’ve come face to
face

BURKE looks around feeling eyes on him then sneers and
walks in

JONAH rubs his chest the spot where BURKE blasted him
crouches down and waits

DISSOLVE TO

EXT REBEL TAVERN - AFTERNOON

Hours have passed JONAH holds his fingers up to the sun
to measure the time just then the tavern door swings
open and BURKE shuffles out onto the street His legs
are wobbly face a mask of bad intent BURKE is
wallpapered and looking to take shit out on someone

JONAH pulls his hat down and follows him

CUT TO

EXT STREETS OF NEW ORLEANS - AFTERNOON

JONAH shadows BURKE down back streets and alleys at
one point he has the jump on him and is about to make a
move but a GAP-TOOTHED HOOKER comes out of nowhere and
cuts him off

GAP-TOOTHED HOOKER
Lookin’ for a bit of this Reb

She lifts her skirt to reveal a white meaty expanse of
haunch

JONAH
Not likely

GAP-TOOTHED HOOKER
Homo

It takes him a moment to relocate BURKE who is ducking
into a below-street-level doorway JONAH follows BURKE
into

INT BROTHEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION -— AFTERNOON

- a dark smoky BROTHEL The lower level lobby of the
building suggests it was once a decent hotel that fell on
hard times some years past HOOKERS in worn-out
lingerie and JOHNS loiter around bored and medicated
no sign of BURKE

A UNION OFFICER pants unbuttoned and shirt open leans
back in a wicker chaise lounge with a couple of caramel-
skinned Creole whores -- he spots JONAH and ducks down
hiding his face

JONAH puts a hand around the waist of a passing WHORE
She stops looks him in the face barely flinches

WHORE
Alright

JONAH
Sweetheart I’m looking for a
friend o’ mine Limey
tattoo you know ‘im

Her demeanor darkens

WHORE
That sick fucks a friend of yours
then to hell with you too
(studies him)
Didnt figger you for a sick fuck

( )

She nods past her shoulder to the stairway

WHORE
He’s here

JONAH nods obliged moves past her towards the stairs

WHORE
Heard we got a new girl I
‘spose

INT BROTHEL - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

JONAH moves down the corridor going room to room
keeping it quiet He pokes his head in on a variety of
unsavory scenes but no sign of BURKE

Then from the next level up muffled screams crying
a loud thud on floorboards a struggle breaking glass

JONAH
Yeah

He rushes up a flight of stairs and down the hall to the
source draws both revolvers -- and KICKS IN THE DOOR

INT BROTHEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

A threadbare room hardly furnished a suitcase by the
bed opened up not even unpacked -- window broken
leading out to the balcony no BURKE

The WOMAN is crumpled in the corner in a fetal position
face hidden behind crossed arms her cries are
horrible ragged

JONAH rushes to the window and looks out in time to see
BURKE drop to the stone-paved alley on drunken legs --
almost completely eating shit -- and stumble away He is
about to follow but

He turns slowly toward the WOMAN on the ground a gradual
shock flows into his face -- the licorice hair the pitch
of the voice

JONAH falls to his knees and takes a hold of her turning
her face gently toward his

It’s LEILA

Her face is burned boiling blood seeps from her ears
Her voice is barely a whisper

LEILA
Jonah Hex

JONAH
Leila how

She turns her face away from him

LEILA
My face fuckin’ bastard
poured acid on me

She turns back to him eyes streaming tears and glazing
over her face is literally melting before his eyes

LEILA
-- is it bad Jonah

JONAH
(choking up fighting
it)
You’re as beautiful a thing as I
ever saw

She begins to hyperventilate body shaking He holds her
tight

LEILA
Glad it was you found me
Hex

JONAH
Leila

LEILA
« evn though theres someone
else you love nalways will
be

Her breathing speeds up uncontrollably she coughs
blood JONAH buries his face in her black curls as her
whole body tenses and then goes limp He gently lays
her head down

JONAH is paralyzed with emotion Until slowly his
left hand forms a fist with sudden rage he slams it
down into the floorboards --

CRACKKK THE FLOOR SPLINTERS ALL THE WAY ACROSS TO THE
WALL AND UP THE CEILING

CUT TO

EXT BROTHEL - DAY

The UNION OFFICER from the BROTHEL LOBBY hurries out into
the cold daylight glancing behind him -- paranoid

He ducks around a corner and pulls a crumpled sheet from
his coat pocket flattens it out

It’s JONAH HEX’S WANTED POSTER

equipment down a wide dirt road EVEN pulis up beside
him

SECOND LIEUTENANT EVEN

GRASS looks at EVEN blank -- slow burning then up
ahead down the road A sign reads

“Yall are now leaving LOUISIANA”

GRASS shakes his head gestures toward the line of
troops

CcuT TO

EXT ALLEY (NEW ORLEANS) - SUNDOWN

JONAHS fingers move across BURKE’S muddy boot print
he is crouched in the alley beneath LEILAS window where
BURKE made his escape -- he looks up two levels of
wrought iron balconies to the broken window

JONAH gazes down the alley to the street beyond as if
testing the wind he moves forward on a mission --
following in BURKES tracks

CUT TO

EXT STREETS OF NEW ORLEANS - SUNDOWN

JONAH moves through a serpentine maze of backstreets and
alleyways shoving past street traffic letting his
instincts guide him

He stumbles onto a CREOLE FUNERAL PROCESSION

NEGROES in worn-out black suits with skeletal white
zombie makeup shuffle along blowing on horns and beating
tambourines and the WOMEN -- in ghostly wedding gowns
stained with chicken blood eyes rolled back in their
skulls almost sleepwalking they seem to float above
the street turning and swaying magic hour throws long
shadows along the paving stones it’s eerie and
beautiful

JONAH falls in with them a ghost among ghosts

The heavy oak casket is borne on the shoulders of eight
men open to the sky JONAH glances toward it --

THE PASSENGER -- A DEAD BLACK BOY no more than 15 -- sits
up and stares straight at him His eyes are filmed-over
no pupils he is dressed in a fine suit and tie

The BOY looks down a passing side street and POINTS
then lies back down as if in reverse motion

JONAH follows the BOY’S directions he falls out of the
parade and down the dark street

EXT NECROPOLIS - SUNDOWN

The backstreet takes him to the outskirts of the city
and opens onto a sprawling above-ground CEMETERY a
city of the dead with square blocks and elaborate marble
monuments

--- only now there is a new population beggars whores
opium addicts they haunt the shadows and sleep in the
shelter of the crypts torches and flaming oil barrels
light the gathering gloom

JONAH kneels amidst the monuments studies the gravel
boot tracks somewhere a baby is crying

He notices something dark glistening on the face of a
marble angel -- has a closer look runs his fingers
through a slippery wad of brown scum holds it to the
light --

A “CSI”-STYLE FLASHBACK

BURKE in this very spot spits a glob of chew SMACK

BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

JONAH’S eyes narrow he’s close

He rounds a corner -- a large CRYPT a brick stairway
leading down oil lamplight flickers below
GUARD
The hell are you lookin’ at

cowboy

JONAH’S eyes dart toward the sound his face is hit by
lamp light -- a burly GUARD one of TURNBULL’S men with
a long rifle is coming toward him

GUARD
(squinting his eyes
to get a better
look)
Hey what’s wrong with your --

JONAH’S Bowie knife thrown true punches into the
GUARDS throat to the hilt the tip pops out the other
side and the man collapses hissing and gurgling

JONAH pulls his knife out of the twitching carcass and
wipes it clean on his pant leg

JONAH
I‘m about outta wise-ass answers
friend

He enters the crypt and heads down the stairs

INT CRYPT - NIGHT
A lamp-lit tunnel built up with planks like the inside

of a mine shaft extends beyond the interior of the
crypt leading into

INT UNDERGROUND RAILROAD - NIGHT

A hollowed-out staging area train platform and tracks
leading into an ink-black tunnel headed south

JONAH ducks behind a wall of crates

( )

Men are leading munitions onto flat cargo cars and
sending them rattling off down the line BURKE is there
spitting out orders

JONAH works his way around to the platform sticking to
the flickering shadows

Finally BURKE grabs an oil lantern and hops onto one of
the flat cars

BURKE
Come on den -- we ain’t got all
day
Another man jumps on with BURKE and starts to crank the
lever-bars setting the thing moving they are towing
another flat carrying weapon crates it passes near
enough to JONAH for him to sneak on

They roll into the dark

INT TUNNEL - NIGHT

The car gets up to speed and starts cooking along
rattling on the steel tracks It’s dead black in the
tunnel -- only BURKE’S oil lantern lights the immediate
area as they travel

Behind BURKE the driver puts his back into the bars
They hit a bump on the tracks -- BURKE’S lamp punks out

Total darkness just the sound of knocking rails

BURKE
Motherfuck

He strikes a flint relights the lamp --

Only now the DRIVER is gone and JONAH HEX is right
behind him

JONAH
Howdy

BURKE goes for his gun but JONAH is on him in a
heartbeat the two men go to the ground grappling

The oil lantern hits the wood floor of the car and
shatters oil spills and flames up

JONAH’S knife is out -- BURKE has a grip on his wrist and
is forcing the knife back at him their faces are
inches from one another -- it’s a brutal death
struggle

BURKE shifts his weight and rolls on top of HEX putting
all his leverage into the knife JONAH’s back lands on
the burning oil extinguishing the flames

SMASH TO BLACK

FADE IN
INT FORT JACKSON - UNDERGROUND RAILROAD - NIGHT

The tunnel opens into a large brick loading platform busy
with men this is clearly the final destination for the
moving arsenal

BURKES flat car comes rolling up to the platform
finally running out of steam and slowing to a rusty stop

One of the men elbows another nods toward the car

MAN
No driver

The other man shrugs they go to work unloading the car
The crates are stacked onto a rolling cart and pushed
down subterranean corridors into

INT FORT JACKSON - THE ARMORY - NIGHT

» a massive high-ceiling brick ARMORY This spread
makes the stockpile at Resurrection City look like a
corner gun shop Truly enough weaponry to outfit an
army

Dynamite crates and big wooden barrels of dynamite are
stacked to the ceiling -- it’s a powder keg alright

The men unload the cart and head back for more they
don’t notice as one of the crates creaks and opens up
behind them

JONAH climbs out looks around His arms are soaked with
blood up to the elbows

JONAH
Hell

He hears more men coming pulls a long silver rifle from
a crate and vanishes into the shadows

CUT TO
EXT FORT JACKSON - BATTLEMENT WALLS - NIGHT

JONAH emerges into the night air from a narrow stairwell
at the top of the fort’s outer battlements He is ata
perfect vantage point to take in one hell of a scene

On one side the brick wall bristles with casements iron
noses of Rodman cannons pointing out over the Mississippi
River

The other side overlooks the open common area and brick
citadel at the interior of the Fort

where a VAST UNRULY MOB has gathered by torchlight --
PERHAPS CLOSE TO A THOUSAND MEN

There is nothing uniform about this group a couple of
REBEL GRAY and CONFEDERATE FLAGS but one or two UNION
UNIFORMS TOO -- it’s a fucking makeshift army

And they are chanting ragged at first then growing in
strength and unity

Turnbull Turnbull TURNBULL TURNBULL

JONAH
Yeah

Theres no sign of TURNBULL

INT FORT JACKSON - CITADEL - NIGHT

TURNBULL sits quietly at a lamp-lit table gazing into
the dark Several of his men stand by around the
perimeter of the room in shadow

ADLEMAN LUSK sits across from him looking like a white
mouse in a snake pit

The chants from outside reverberate through the thick
stone walls of the citadel For LUSK it’s like a
ringing phone that no one will answer

LUSK
They’re calling for you

TURNBULL’S eyes turn toward LUSK -- they are dark
distant yet somehow amused

( )

TURNBULL
The Union’s worst nightmare Lusk
A risen South Armed mobilized
drunk with rage Listen

The chanting builds and echoes

TURNBULL
There are a hundred thousand just
like them from the corn fields of
Nebraska to the shores of the
Atlantic

LUSK
An Army You’ll be President
Turnbull

TURNBULL just smirks

TURNBULL
President
(shakes his head)
What would you say if I told you I
had no intention of ever marching
into Washington DC

LUSK
(confused)
But I
TURNBULL

I’ve seen the future Lusk Power
no longer lies in the hands of
Presidents or armies It lies in
the shadows Terror is its
greatest weapon

TURNBULL rises dusts off his coat adjusts the sword at

his side

TURNBULL
You delivered my message well
little bird The scoundrels in
our Capital have already fallen
into my pocket They’1ll vote as
they’re told make war when it
suits me

The men shrug

TURNBULL
Having his tea I expect the
whoremongering bastard
(shrugs it off)
Alright then
(to his men)
It’s time

EXT FORT JACKSON - THE CITADEL - NIGHT

Across the common JONAH zeroes in on TURNBULL with laser
precision as he makes his entrance he emerges at the
base of the citadel where a makeshift wooden stage
awaits him Two ROUGHNECKS bookend him like Secret
Service holding back the throng

TURNBULL climbs up onto the wood platform like a king
ascending the throne

The mob erupts in cheers

LONG LIVE JEFFERSON DAVIS

And then rising like a hell’s chorus of flaming

banshees the legendary REBEL YELL high-pitched and
eerie -- KEE-YIII KEE-YIII YIP YIP YIP -- an ear-
piercing roar that had struck terror into the hearts of
many a Mudsill in the early days of the great conflict

eee eH FF HH HH

TURNBULL holds up a CONFEDERATE FLAG in his left hand
letting the cacophony swell to a crescendo then drops

his left hand and raises his right -- palm open enough
The MOB gradually silences
TURNBULL
I’m looking upon the face of a
nation

Murmurs of approval ripple through the men

TURNBULL
A nation bowed and bruised and
driven underground - but never
defeated

They like this PAN ACROSS the faces in the crowd
glistening with perspiration in the firelight

TURNBULL

I see amongst you rich and poor
old and young educated and
common What do we share A
dream A vision

(beat)
No Dreams my friends -- they’re
for dreamers The work that lies
ahead for us will be done in the
cold light of day -- not by
dreamers by ploughmen by
soldiers by butchers It is
the work of vengeance and
“restitution and it requires a
different fuel

The mob stirs and rumbles

TURNBULL

Anger

(beat)
Anger is what we share All of
us A terrible anger growing
within our hearts like a flower
taken to seed in blood-soaked
soil come to bloom in its due
time Anger it carries us
feeds us provides us solace and
succor You can feel it can’t
you

Yes they can

( )

TURNBULL turns toward LUSK who cowers behind the
platform -- Turnbull’s eyes flash malice amusement
triumph LUSK is the only one who can truly appreciate
the manipulative brilliance of TURNBULL’S performance

TURNBULL

Inside you -- that beating that
great pounding like the drums of
war hot and quick in your veins --
Anger Cherish it nurture it
let it boil and rise

(gestures toward the

battlements where

JONAH watches)
These walls once a fine feather
in the cap of the Union -- now
abandoned left for us to reclaim
Our enemies have fled north grown
fat and sallow inattentive

(beat)
They have forgotten us for dead
But NOTHING STAYS DEAD my
friends every precious thing
lost may be one day redeemed

TURNBULL seems on the verge of being overcome by emotion
Is he talking about the Confederacy Or JEB He holds
up a clutching trembling fist

TURNBULL
As long as a man holds a thing in
his heart it can be buried --
but in its due hour IT
WILL RISE

The MOB is ready to rock and roll

TURNBULL
IT WILL RISE

They erupt in a deafening REBEL YELL JONAH watches
all from his position on the battlement

JONAH
Had about enough ‘er this
nonsense

He cocks the long rifle
Just then a whistling in the sky three GLOWING
PROJECTILES arc over the scene launched from outside the

fort throwing off sparks and smoke -- one rosy-colored
one white one blue

( )

The ROSY-COLORED ROCKET lands right in the middle of the
MOB and explodes into a phosphorescent pink smoke
cloud the men back off forming a circle

The WHITE ROCKET comes down right behind TURNBULL
showering him with sparks TURNBULL barely flinches his
ROUGHNECKS stumble in the dirt waving away the thick
smoke and coughing

TURNBULL
(ice cold)
What the blazes
The BLUE ROCKET overshoots the common hits the far
battlement where JONAH is hiding bounces and skitters
along the stone walkway straight at JONAH

JONAH
My puckered cornhole

The thing explodes in a flash of blue fire JONAH has to
duck down to avoid being illuminated

From the battlement opposite JONAH’S perch a LOOKOUT is
waving and yelling

LOOKOUT
Yankees A whole mess ‘er ‘em

Men flock to the casements to see crowding over one
another

EXT FORT JACKSON NIGHT

GRASS and a hundred or so troops are gathered outside

spreading out for position -- several dozen cavalry
including SECOND LIEUTENANT EVEN the rest common

One thing’s for sure they don’t look like near enough
to take on what’s inside TURNBULL’S FORT

GRASS hollers into a brass BULLHORN

for treason and some of you for

destruction of property

Aw hell there don’t look to be

come out in an orderly fashion
Quentin Turnbull you kin show
your face first and then everyone
else kin folla’ There ain’t no
need for no one to get shot dead

Rebs see fit to cooperate

TURNBULL has made his way to a vantage point atop the
battlement wall He looks down on GRASS’ men with cold
malice

TURNBULL
And so it begins

He turns to his ROUGHNECKS

TURNBULL
Throw open the armory

And then calling down to the REBEL MOB

TURNBULL
ARM YOURSELVES FRIENDS THIS WAR
BEGINS ANEW TONIGHT

The MOB lets up a frenzied whoop and holler they
to stampede across the common toward the ARSENAL

JONAH
(quietly)
Damn it Grass You really done
it now

He looks over at the smoldering BLUE ROCKET
phosphorous smoke and sparks still flare from it
wraps a cloth around his hand grabs the thing up
bails back down over the battlement wall

EXT FORT JACKSON - NIGHT
GRASS lowers the BULLHORN satisfied

LIEUTENANT GRASS
(to EVEN)
That outta set the fear of God in

He takes a look at his gold pocket watch
LIEUTENANT GRASS
Give ‘em till five clicks past the
hour to comply -- then were goin’
in

EVEN doesn’t answer just glances at GRASS sidelong He
looks a good bit less than confident

and then swarms back out falling all over themselves
and trampling one another in a panic

BLUE SMOKE AND SPARKS HAVE STARTED TO BILLOW AND CRACKLE
FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE ARSENAL

REDNECK

TURNBULL takes notice of this new commotion

TURNBULL
Now what

The ROUGHNECKS peek around the corner to the source of
the BLUE SMOKE -- then bail off running

BOOM BOOMBOOM BOOM -- A SERIES OF MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS
RIP OPEN THE STONE BATTLEMENT BEHIND THE FLEEING MEN
TURNBULL’S ROUGHNECKS are lifted off their feet and
thrown like ragdolls

Rubble fire and exploding ricocheting ordnance fly

armed with motherfucking FLAME THROWERS -- with big
red oil barrels wheeling in on carts INFANTRY ignites
the O-rings and the INBREDS from the testing facility
climb up and start pumping

WOOOOOOOOOSHHHH ITS A REDNECK COOK-OFF

Any REBS that aint on fire are stampeding toward the
exits running right past GRASS’ SOLDIERS and into the

night

TURNBULL looks on in shock speechless He scans the

chaos for answers -- and finds one

JONAH HEX is standing dead still across the common
staring him straight in the eye Dying men -- on fire -

run back and forth between them TURNBULL freezes Time
stands still His eyes narrow burning with rage

JONAH slowly reaches into a canvas bag and pulls
something out holds it up for TURNBULL to see it
looks like loose fabric at first but on closer
analysis

It could be a rubber mask of BURKE if such a thing were
yet invented -- JONAH makes sure to turn it so that
TURNBULL can see the tattoos

TURNBULL’S eyes widen it’s BURKE’S face skinned from
his very head

( )

TURNBULL
DAMN YOU TO HELL JONAH HEX

JONAH

TURNBULL pulls two long pistols from his belt

TURNBULL
THEN BY GOD WE’LL SETTLE IT NOW

JONAH just shakes his head

JONAH

TURNBULL narrows his eyes burning

You know where

JONAH tosses BURKE’S face to the dirt

TURNBULL loses his shit roars and charges -- but a group
of FLAMING REBS go stumbling in the way blocking
TURNBULLS view of HEX by the time they pass JONAH
has disappeared

TURNBULL looks around in a fury no sight of him

TURNBULL
HEXXXX

TURNBULL’S one surviving ROUGHNECK comes up behind him
claps a hand on his shoulder TURNBULL spins points a
pistol between the man’s eyes -- sees who it is and —-
in a rage -- almost pulls the trigger anyway Instead
he sucks it in and lowers the weapon

ROUGHNECK
Mr Turnbull we best go

GRASS EVEN and the mounted CAVALRY have made their
entrance they are mopping up the stragglers

TURNBULL gathers his senses A CAVALRY SOLDIER rides up
TURNBULL gives him both barrels in the chest knocking
him right off his horse

TURNBULL
The trains

( )

He makes his way to the tunnels followed close by his
last ROUGHNECK shoving aside the REBS in his way
leaving his busted army behind to burn and die

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
EXT RED VALLEY LOUISIANA - MORNING

RED CLAY A lonesome raindrop hits then another the
valley is punctured by a thousand drops

We are in the valley where JEB TURNBULL and the rest of
SLOCUM’S BOYS died It’s empty now but wed know that
red mud anywhere

Dead set in the middle with nothing near it a pine box
coffin

A single BLACK CROW flutters down from the pale sky and
rests on it gives the wood a peck

TURNBULL and his ROUGHNECK stand at the edge of the
valley looking on

ROUGHNECK
Mr Turnbull

TURNBULL
(ice cold)
I see it
He calls out
TURNBULL
HEX SHOW YOURSELF YOU YELLOW
BASTARD
TURNBULL’S voice echoes across the valley - nothing

TURNBULL
Damn it

He starts to stomp through the mud toward the coffin

ROUGHNECK
Sir it’s shore a trap

TURNBULL
Fuck off

The ROUGHNECK follows him gun drawn not liking it
They reach the coffin TURNBULL looks around

TURNBULL
(calling out)
WELL
Nothing
TURNBULL
(to the ROUGHNECK
nodding toward the
coffin)
Open it
ROUGHNECK
But --

TURNBULL pokes his long pistol at him

TURNBULL
I said open it

The ROUGHNECK glowers at him then turns to the coffin
The wet CROW hasn’t moved

The ROUGHNECK backhands it the CROW flutters off
squawking He swallows heavily and lifts the lid of the
pine box it’s empty

More black crows descend around the perimeter of the
valley The ROUGHNECK LOOKS back at TURNBULL and
shrugs

BANG A shot comes from nowhere the ROUGHNECK his
head spouting dark blood falls forward into the coffin
the lid falls shut over him

TURNBULL spins attempting to follow the source of the

shot -- he sees movement FIRES -- crows flutter away
TURNBULL
Show your face Hex or whats
left of it
He spins again -- BANG BANG BANG shooting at
nothing at phantoms until --

Click Click Click

His pistols are empty he throws them into the mud wild-
eyed -- then from behind him

SOMETHING BURIED IS RISING UP OUT OF THE EARTH TURNBULL
feels the eyes on his back he slowly turns

JONAH HEX stands up before him covered in RED CLAY from
head to toe a monster a devil

TURNBULL
Hex

JONAH
Time we settled our score

LIGHTNING flashes over the valley it burns us white
hot back in time --

CUT TO

FLASHBACK - EXT ARAPAHO VILLAGE - NIGHT

An OIL LANTERN swings and explodes into the face of the
young unscarred JONAH he grits his teeth and shakes it
off

HEX is tied to a stake with heavy rope soaked from head
to toe the modest Indian settlement smokes and
smolders in the bg

A dozen or so men move around him vaguely defined in the
firelight one spits on him others laugh

TURNBULL -- six years younger -- has a young ARAPAHO GIRL
by the arm twisting it behind her back with her other

arm she holds a crying BUNDLED BABY She is delirious
with tears and shock

(NOTE We may recognize her from the legendary
apocryphal story related earlier ending with the
avalanche in the mountains -- JONAH’S INJUN WIFE)

JONAH
Turnbull by God

TURNBULL
You have something to say to me
traitor

JONAH
I swear it I never gave those men
up I was framed

TURNBULL nods considering -- then strides right up to
JONAH’S face dragging the ARAPAHO GIRL through the dirt
by her hair -- the crying baby clutched to her chest

TURNBULL
I want you to answer me a
question Jonah Hex And think
very carefully about the answer
you give

(MORE )

( )

TURNBULL (CONTD)
Did you -- or did you not -- walk
out and desert your brigade

JONAH says nothing just glares into TURNBULL’S eyes

TURNBULL
I said did you or did you not
steal away like a rat in the night
and desert your brigade sir

JONAH
Turnbull

TURNBULL
Yes you shorely did Jonah Hex
So you see it doesn’t really
matter one lick if what you say is
true or what you say is false
now does it

JONAH strains against the ropes with everything he has

TURNBULL
You took everything from me
traitor And now you’re going to
watch me take something from you

JONAH
NO

TURNBULL grins but there’s no humor in it he throws the
GIRL to the ground the BABY crashes hard to the dirt
raises up his eagle-top cane

and brings it down again and again as the
men jeer as JONAH screams again and again until
there is the stillness and complete quiet of two lifeless
bodies

JONAH slumps forward half conscious his body
drained

JONAH
Kill me

TURNBULL
Not tonight And not here

One of TURNBULLS MEN hands him a glowing brand --
TURNBULL shows HEX the molten white-hot letters

QT
He pushes the brand into JONAH’S cheek searing the
letters into his flesh -- then tears it away

( )

TURNBULL’S smoking initials are clearly inscribed on
HEX’S face

TURNBULL
No sir -- That’s a mercy I will
most surely not extend Youre
going to go free Jonah Hex Free
to walk this land with a mark upon
your flesh something like Cain
in the old Holy Books and that
mark’s going to remind you --
every single day -- of the man
that took everything you had You
understand me Jonah Hex
JONAH just stares into TURNBULL’S eyes and beyond
Another FLASH of LIGHTNING --

CUT TO

EXT APACHE BURIAL GROUNDS - SUNDOWN

JONAH stumbles across the barren terrain willing his
body forward racked by tears and madness

- finally collapsing before a pool of still water

He crawls up on his hands and knees -- and stares into
the black water at his own reflection eyes wild with
fury TURNBULL’S brand stares back at him

MONTAGE

He strikes a flint drawing sparks

Fire catches the brush and blooms

He holds a tomahawk to the licking flames

The iron blade glows red

Then orange

Then white

With each image the sun has dropped farther over the
horizon -- night has fallen -- the moon is unimaginably
huge hanging low

With steel in his eyes JONAH holds the hot blade up to

his face illuminating it and presses it hard to his
cheek

( )

A primal scream escapes from his lungs or from the
underworld as his flesh burns and melts

One last time LIGHTNING FLASHES --

CUT TO

EXT RED VALLEY LOUISIANA - MORNING (PRESENT)

Answering thunder echoes through the valley -- we are
back in PRESENT DAY

The rain has continued to fall washing the red clay from
JONAH’S face -- we see clearly what he did to himself
with the burning blade untold years ago

JONAH
Guess there ain’t much left to say
between us

TURNBULL snarls pure animal He lifts his cane and
swings it down on JONAHS head

JONAH catches it rips it from TURNBULL’S hand corrects

his grip on the hickory handle -- and swings it down two
handed

B-BOOM

JONAH doubles over stung -- shocked Blood seeps from

his ribs and left shoulder he puts his fingers to the
wet crimson -- what the hell just happened He looks up
at TURNBULL

who is holding two smoking Derringers at hip level
TURNBULL plants a boot in JONAH’S midsection and pushes
him away JONAH stumbles backwards left arm limp and
numb at his side still holding the EAGLE-TOPPED CANE in
his right

TURNBULL strides up to him without fear He’s won He
places the barrels of both guns against JONAH’S skull

But with a surge of strength JONAH swings up with the
CANE smashing it into TURNBULL’S face

TURNBULLS head snaps back JONAH presses his
advantage he swings the cane down hard with his good
hand

The cane hits the crown of TURNBULL’S dome and shatters
into splinters with the impact -- blood pours down his
forehead

TURNBULL brings up his right arm pointing the gun at
JONAH JONAH smacks it away with the cane - BOOM Crows
flutter and fly

He brings up the other hand the cane swings - smack --
BOOM
TURNBULL ROARS -- a beast a Tyrannosaurus sinking into

the tar -- defiant

JONAH swings again with whats left of the cane again
and again

TURNBULL crumples to the mud JONAH falls on him -- the
cane has disintegrated so he uses his fists CRUNCH
CRUNCH It could be TURNBULL’S head breaking it
could be JONAH’S hands He just keeps bringing his
blood-soaked fists down ‘til there’s no resistance
he’s pounding mush into the mud

When the thing is finally done JONAH rises unsteadily to
his feet stands over him It’s quiet just the sound of
the rain on the red clay He looks around
disoriented sits down on the edge of the pine box

A crow lands on TURNBULL’S body The rain falls
He just sits a spell

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
EXT REBEL CEMETERY - SUNDOWN

A rundown military cemetery long rows of simple graves
stretching all along a hillside -- not as fancy and
impressive as what they got at Arlington but honorable
nonetheless The graves are mostly unmarked but some
are decorated here and again with faded flowers Rebel
flags and whatnot

JONAH stands by an unmarked stone His shattered hands
are wrapped with dark stained cloth

JONAH
(quietly)
Sorry about it Jeb I know he
was your daddy

He kneels gingerly places the SILVER EAGLE in the dirt
by the stone It catches the sun something pretty

He walks to the base of the hill The old iron gate
leans crooked JONAH unties his HORSE and climbs on

LIEUTENANT GRASS (0S)
You hold on just a damn minute
Hex

GRASS EVEN and a dozen MILITIA canter up on horseback
moving to block the road

JONAH
I had about enough’er you fuckers

LIEUTENANT GRASS
The feelin’s mutual bounty hunter
-- don’t you doubt that ‘Twer up
to me you’d be swingin’ by a rope
for all you done But apparently
some see it different

EVEN hands GRASS a piss-stained folded square of
parchment

LIEUTENANT GRASS
I’m here to extend to you a full
pardon for your perfidious
murderin’ acts effective
immediate courtesy the US
Government

EVEN hands him another stack of paper tied up with
string

LIEUTENANT GRASS
Furthermore the sum of five
hundred dollars payable in these
here US Government certificates

He holds out the papers

LIEUTENANT GRASS
(smirking)
Y’kin redeem these in any federal
government assistance center Got
a real nice one up in DC

HEX looks at the little stack of paper then gives GRASS
a long look then spits in the dirt

JONAH
Thanks all the same

He steers his horse past the SOLDIERS and down the road
GRASS calls after him red faced still holding the
paper

( )

LIEUTENANT GRASS
You‘re nothing but a ghost Hex
A thing of the past The world
has moved on -- got civilized
there’s no more room in’it for men
like you

EVEN looks GRASS up and down not much impressed

EXT DIRT ROAD - CONTINUOUS ACTION - SUNDOWN

JONAH ambles his horse toward the horizon EVEN rides up
next to him and slows to match his pace

JONAH gives him a sidelong look says nothing

EVEN pulls out his flask of whiskey and tosses it to him
JONAH catches it

JONAH
That I will take

JONAH unscrews the cap hits it

SECOND LIEUTENANT EVEN
Shore do wish we could have us
that sit down sometime Mr Hex

It’s a long moment before JONAH speaks

JONAH
Someday mebbe Believe I’1l ride
on my own a spell

SECOND LIEUTENANT EVEN
Where you headed

JONAH considers

JONAH
The mountains first I expect
after that
(shrugs)
Who gives a damn

He takes a last hit turns the flask over and shakes it
-- not a drop left tosses it back to the SOLDIER

JONAH
Don’t fergit to git yer dick wet
soldier

SECOND LIEUTENANT EVEN
No sir I wont

JONAH dips his hat to EVEN and rides on EVEN slows up
and watches him go

The sun is red and low in the west and JONAH heads
toward it

EVEN smiles starts whistling a familiar tune

once a poem called “Defence of Fort McHenry” but we
know it by a different name “The Star Spangled Banner”

FADE OUT
