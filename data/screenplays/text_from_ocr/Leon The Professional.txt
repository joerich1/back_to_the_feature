Oo

In TONYS mostly deserted restaurant a match lights and-takes us from darkness
CLOSE ON the end of a lighted cigarette and then TONYs lips
Be

TONY and
Its good to see ya Leaf »

CLOSE ON LEON’s glasses one of his eyes and his hands wikdh - in contrast to
TONY’s hands - don’t move at all

LEONs eye moves and TONY fidgets with his glass of wine

Old TONY takes out a photo and slides it across the table

TONY
This time it’s for Morizio You maember Motizio
don’t you

LEON shakes his head affirmatively and grabs his glass of milk

TONY
Morizio’s a big shot so it’s gotta be done right -
yknow So this fat-bastard’s trying to start-up a
little business and it’s making big Morizio a little
nervous he doesn’t need the heat Morizio would
like to talk to him can you arrange it

LEON drinks his milk
Everything is close-up because this is LEON’s world his concentration is deep and he’s

only interested in the details of the conversation Nothing from the outside world bothers

LEON
There’s a drop of milk on the comer of LEON’s lip which he wipes clean with his
thumb

TONY is waiting for the answer

LEON
“ty Yes Tcan

LEON takes the photo from the table in the picture there’s a fat MAN

The FATMAN in the photo comes out of a limo with dark windows

There are eight BODYGUARDS with him one stays at the bottom of the elevator and the
others follow the FATMAN upstairs

)

J

3INT APARTMENT - DAY

The doorbell rings and a sultry BLOND opens the door She smiles because she’s happy
tosee him although she’d probably have the same expression if somebady handed her
ten-thousand dollars

FATMAN (to his bodyguards)
Make it good We got an hot
wv
He leads her into another room while his men open some attache cases and transfer many
bags of white powder

Meanwhile LEON is on the subway carrying a toolbox and wearing a large raincoat and

funky glasses
These scenes are intercut with LEON going to work like any other commuter

LEON is in-front of the same building as the FATMAN
The first BODYGUARD is at the bottom of the elevator suddenly he has a silencer at his
head (We don’t see LEON)

LEON (off)
Call your boss tell ’im I wanna talk to him

FATMAN has a hard time tearing himself away from the blond He’s pissed-off to be
interrupted but knows it must be important and that he has to answer the call

FATMAN (into telephone)
What-the-fuck-is-it

BODYGUARD (uneasy)
7 Burt downstairs ‘There’s a guy who says he wants
to talk to you

FATMAN
Are you fuckin’ out of your ‘head Cant you see Im
busy Who the fuck is it What’s he want

LEON (off to Burt)
Tell him I’m coming up

BURT (off)
He’s coming up

a

FATMAN hears a dry snap BURT has said his last words

FATMAN forgets the blorid and begins to panic

Three BODYGUARDS leave the apartment and wait at the elevator with their guns
drawn

Downstairs the elevator shuts and begins to go up By walkie-talkie one BODYGUARD
warns the BODYGUARDon the fire-escape and the BODYGUARD on the other side of
the apartment of their potential problem

c BODYGUARD (off through walkie-talkie)
Mikey wake up - we got a guest

MIKEY takes out his gun and waits anziounly
The elevator rises The BODYGUARDS ate a too nervous and pump it full of bullets as

it stops

FATMAN is nervous ‘even though he has three BODYGUARDS with him i in nthe
apartment
A BODYGUARD opens the elevator door BURT looks like swiss cheese
Theres no trace of LEON

On the other side of the building a small trap-door slowly opens above MIKEY
We see a metal stem with a small mirror (like a dentist’s instrument) LEON’s eye
reflects in the mirror The tool works like a periscope and spots MIKEY

Back in the elevator one of the BODYGUARDS tries to understand what a thread is
doing on BURT’s corpse He opens BURTs jacket in order to see where it’s coming
from a grenade with no pin

EXPLOSION

The elevator and landing are blown to bits

FATMAN jumps up and the BLOND covers her mouth to stifle her scream

None of them dare leave the apartment to see the damage on the contrary a
BODYGUARD makes sure that all the locks are secure

MIKEY starts to freak he decides to leave but suddenly LEON grabs him from above
Forafew seconds MIKEY dangles likes a puppet

FATMAN tries to leave bythe emergency exit He opens the door only to find MIKEY
“hanging in front of him He shuts the door-and bolts it They feel that the apartment has

become a mousetrap - and theyre not wrong

LEON breaks a small tile to make a hole in the kitchen wall

He puts his eye to thehole He sees the BODYGUARDS and FATMAN in the living
room ‘He slides’a tube through the little hole then inserts a poisoned dart and blows into
it A BODYGUARD goes down FATMAN shuts the living room door

The mousetrapis getting smaller

On the balcony a gun cartridge falls - probably from the roof

CF

The two BODYGUARDS See it and realize that the killer is on the roof They cautiously
move onto the large balcony

Suddenly a metal ‘partition falls separating them physically and visually from FATMAN
At the same time the lights go out on FATMAN

There are shots on the balcony FATMAN is about to pass-out The silence is
unbearable Through one of bullet holes in the curtain we see LEON’s eye On the
partition we hear knock knock FATMAN fires his uzi into the partition making it
look like a connect-the-dots game

FATMAN realizes that he didn’t hit anything and becomes frightened He picks-up a

cordless phone

VOICE (off) a)
911 Police Emergenty 77 Please state -your name and
reason for calling oO 8

FATMAN
Officer down officer down Come quick - help

VOICE (off)

Hold on J’ll get a detective
A muzak version of “Bridge Over Troubled Water plays through the phone while
FATMAN waits for a detective FATMAN backs into a dark comer to hide
Out of the darkness comes a blade that stops at FATMAN’s throat A face appears -
here’s LEON

VOICE (off)
Jefferson here did you say officer down

FATMAN is -sweating profusely

FATMAN
J’t call back later

He hangsup the phone - LEON shows hima piece of paper

LEON

FATMAN’s finger trembles as he dials Half naked the BLOND tiptoes across the room
nervously ‘She tries to make a cute smile at FATMAN and LEON but she’s really
terrified

BLOND
Jll Pll call ya later OK Bubba

She leaves LEON hasn’t moved an inch
FATMAN

I got half of Bolivia in that suitcase over there -

LEON (unmoved)
Mister Morizio would like to speak to you

FATMAN

FATMAN

FATMAN gently passes the phone back to LEON

LEON (into phone)

“LEON hangs up and ‘pauses ‘for amoment FATMAN i is freaking

’ LEON (seriously)
So do you understand

‘FATMAN ‘(about to pass-out)

LEON puts away his knife and disappears’ into the darkness

FATMAN takes one step and faints

scissor-kicking her tees in rhythm again

LEON puts on his raincoat
He opens the window near the plant to let the sun shine on it
He exits

In the hallway in front of the GIRLs apartment LEON leans against the door he hears

the aerobics music BR a

LEON goes to the movies

The theater is practically empty He watches intensely ‘He seems to be studying the

actors’ movements

On the screen Fred Astaire cuts loose and is bouncing off the walls

LEON taps his knee LEON’s eyes meet those of a MAN sitting near him and LEON
tries to share his excitement with the man

LEON
Its just incredible The way he moves I’ve seen it
thirty times and I still don’t know how he does it

The MAN who is certainly just sitting thefaby chance wants nothing to do with LEON
LEON forgets about him and concentrates on the screen again

LEON slowly walks-up the stairs to his apartment

Again the GIRL is sitting on the stairs This time she has a bloody nose She has her
head down and is holding her finger under her nose to stop the bleeding

LEON stops in front of her

When she raises her head he sees her bloody’ nose

LEON (without humor)
Maybe you should stop riding that bike so much

He pauses then gives her a tissue Shes surprised - at first a little suspicious - simply
because someone is actually giving her something She takes it

GIRL

Theres a long pause

She wipes her nose- which i is no longer bleeding

is it always like this or does it ert easier when
you’ re older —

LEON (after a moment)
Always like this
Just gotta deal with it -

She gently lowers her head LEON passes her and heads towards his apartment

looks to see what’s happening in the hallway As usual he has a gun in his hand

-In the apartment the FATHER ‘grabs a gun that’s hidden behind the curtain and shoots a
MAN The slaughter commences in a flash the mother father sister and brother are

shot dead
Instantaneously the living room explodes into a bloodbath like a match falling into a
barrel of kerosine

Then tranquility returns to the apartment

LEON’ worried he puts ‘down his pistol and’ picks-up a Kalaschnikv

- The search forthe book continues

The GIRL carrying two very large bags of groceries comes up the stairs
She slows her steps

She immediately senses that somethings wrong

- LEON’s worried about her

MALKY watches her approach

Looking down as always the GIRL sees the feet of her dead father as one of the men
drags his body through the hallway Without breaking her stride or tooteng up she
walks right past her apartment as if nothing has happened

She pretends not to notice MALKY who is still guarding het apartment door

She goes to the end of the hallway stops in front of LEON’s door and rings the buzzer
Tears start to roll down her cheeks

MALKY is still watching her

Now LEON is really worried He doesnt know what to do

Finally LEON opens the door The GIRL enters without a word
LEON doesn’t take his eyes off MALKY - He shuts the doar picks-up his Kalaschnikov

and continues to watch through the hole

The GIRL finds the kitchen and puts the groceries in the fridge She looks as if she’s
under fypeosis

You don’t know anything man Listen you re gonna

weak to lift that milk to you lips anymore

LEON (sighs)
Look you’ve only been here two hours and you’ re

MATHILDA

(she begins to cry)
What do you want me to do - I got no place to go

LEON feels confused and helpless

LEON

- Youve -had’a rough day go to sleep and well talk

MATHILDA ‘nods’yes’ and gets-up She’s so tired that she stumbles and LEON helps
her to the bedroom She sits on nthe edge of the bed

MATHILDA

LEON (looking for a blanket)
“Forget it

MATHILDA
Youve been really great with me and it’s not

for a change 2

LEON tries to fake a smile
MATHILDA
Gnight Leon
LEON

Good night Mathilda

She smiles she’s already almost asleep LEON shuts the door

It’s the middle of the night and LEON is sitting in his armchair

He cant sleep he’s thinking

Finally he makes a decision and gets up He opens the double-bass case takes out a gun
and puts a silencer on it

He quietly enters the bedroom and approaches MATHILDA who is cuddled-up with
Piggy

He can’t even bring himself to aim at her

He goes back and sits down in his armchair

Early morning

LEON is working-out his feet are wedged under the sofa

MATHILDA wakes up and walks across the living room towards the kitchen ‘as if she is
sleep-walking

Without stopping his work-out LEON watches her from the corner of his eye

‘In the kitchen’ MATHILDA serves herself a big bowl of Cor Flakes an¢ milk She

“doesn’t looks very happy -

LEON joins her and pours himself a glass of milk Neither one of them speak
Finally LEON breaks the silence

26
LEON
‘Sleep well

MATHILDA nods ‘yes’
(dryly)
Good ‘cause after breakfast you gotta take-off

MATHILDA is only half-surprised

Where to

ar
LEON “gs
That’s not my problem —

He leaves the kitchen and goes into the living room -

He opens the window and puts the plant in the sunlight

He puts some guns on the table and begins to nervously clean them

MATHILDA finishes her milk and licks her lips in order to remove her white mustache
She comes into the living roomand sits across from LEON

She slides a paper in front of him

LEON continues to polish his guns He feels uncomfortable

LEON
Whats it say

MATHILDA
Read it

LEON hesitates tries to read it then he puts it down

MATHILDA after a moment)
Don’t know how to read - do ya

MATHILDA is not at all condescending

LEON ‘
I’m learnin’ but I’ve had alot of work lately so Im
a little behind

MATHILDA
When I was real young I didn’t want to learn but dad
would beat the hell out of me I guess I don’t mind

LEON is encouraged he doesn’t feel like she’s judging him He picks-up the paper

Y LEON

ww L 1 Ive dee

MATHILDA finishes the sentence

I’ve MATA what I am going to do with my life

- LEON explodes He throws a gun on the table

LEON (upset)
(He hands her the gun)
Go ahead be a hit man woman

Take it It’s a goodbye present Cause’ youre not
gonna do it around here
‘I can’t do anything for you You gotta do it on your

Alone I work ‘alone Y’understand

MATHILDA
What about Bonny and Clyde® - eh “Butch Cascidy

LEON
Well there ain’t gonna be any “Leon and Mathilda
‘y’understand It’s not gonna be like that

work alone isn’t it

MATHILDA
What-the-hell are youafraid of Leon Me - is that

feelings for me

Don’t be afraid you can be a hitman and sill have
feelings yknow It’s cool

LEON
- What are you saying I’m not afraid Ive had
enough of you that’s i

MATHILDA
You-don’t want me because you’ re afraid of bein’ ces
stuck to someone but it’s too late I’m yours’

LEON sighs he’s lost

LEON (trying to keep his cool)

‘Mathilda why are you doing this to me Ive been
Nothing but nice to you J even saved your life -
yesterday right outside the door

MATHILDA

Right And so now youre responsible for it If you

saved my life you must have saved it for a reason
Now it’s your responsibility Otherwise you
shouldve let me die on your doorstep

Tt wouldve been less cruel ”

If you throw me out now it’s just like not opening
the door’ But you opened it so

MATHILDA (She becomes very sweet)

Just give me a chance Leon just one-chance

you don’t help me Ill die tonight I can feel ii and
I don’t wanna die tonight

LEON

MATHILDA (avoiding the trap)

No y‘just look a little younger than eighteen
MATHILDA

Tl probably still be pretty hot when I’m thirty then -

LEON
What I-dunno
(trying again)

Anyway eighteen isn’t enough ‘Mathilda Ycan’t

MATHILDA

LEON thinks and realizes that he doesn’t have an argument

LEON

LEON

man’ sjob Its hard

She senses that he’s about fobecome infuriated

kd

MATHILDA
OK

LEON

You think it’s easy because you’ve seen it on TV
But on television they get up and go home every
night With-me noone gets up and noone goes
home ever

MATHILDA
OK

LEON

(he picks up the gun)

Do you know what it’s like to stand with one of these
in your hand face-to-facewith some guy you gotta
kill It’s heavy hard cold it makes fuckin’ terrible
noise Some guns are so powerful that they almost
rip your arm clear-off when you fire ‘em

And y’can’t just shoot anyone with any gun It takes
years to learn all that

MATHILDA
OK

LEON (upset)
Dont just say ’OK’ goddammit
It’s not just fuckin’ OK’

-You don’t know a damn thing about it

It’s hell

-j

MATHILDA (calmly)
Youre right Idon’t know anything But if the last
couple of years have been heaven Tl take hell

anyday

LEON (sighs)

Living in hell and working in hell are two very
different things I don’t know what youve been
through but killing people is another story Don’t
take it badly but I dont think youre up for it

MATHILDA loses her temper

Suddenly she grabs a gun from the table goes to the window and with determination
shoots anything that moves in the street she empties the cartridge and drops the gun back
onto the table

MATHILDA “a

Hows that Or do you want some more

LEON is paralyzed

MATHILDA

Thanks Leon It’s the first time soho has
-given me a chance

LEON and MATHILDA are on the roof of a townhouse They are leaning against the
wall eon

LEON (with concentration)

First ylook for at least a minute - ’cause some
surveillance systems only work every thirty seconds
So we wait And we watch First the system then
the sky - for-helicopters - then the neighboring

- buildings When you scout-out the place y’make
‘sure that you remember what the place looks like -

- ° -especially colors - ‘cause you ‘gotta dress the same
‘scihaide “Never brighter --you’ ‘don’t wanna stand-out

MATHILDA listens attentively

OK good Now you can assemble your gun
He opens the violin case and begins to assemble ay sifle with telescopic lens and silencer

© “The rifle is the first weapon you Jeam how to use

- because-it lets you keep your distance from the client
‘The closer you get to being a pro the closer you can
Bet to the client

Orie of LEON’s idiosyncrasies is that he calls his targets and victims CLIENTS
He finishes assembling the rifle and gives it to MATHILDA
She starts to take the cap off of the lens

oO LEON

No Never take it off until the last minute - it
reflects light And then they can see you comin’
from a mile-away

They go to the edge of the roof and look out onto the stréeta

MATHILDA sits and puts herself in position a
oO
You gotta be relaxed feel obfifortable
That’s the most important thing

MATHILDA settles into position
MATHILDA
Here now I’m OK

LEON
Good

o ay LEON takes the caps off of the lens

Le This here’s the lightenhancer for night-shooting
Here you mark the clients distance -
How far do ythink the park bench is from here

MATHILDA
Half-a-mile

LEON
Try 500 feet

MATHILDA
How can you tell

LEON

Look here when you see the fingers it’s 100 feet
when you see the-whole hand it’s 250 feet when you
see the arm it’s 500 feet If you don’t see the arm
you don’t ‘shoot Thatmeans that it’s not‘a sure
thing that youre only four-for-five - and’ four-for-
five doesn’t make a hitman Five for five always
five for five Y’cant take chances cause y’cant

bee miss - ever If it’s a delicate job or risky then you
) have a contingency plan back-up

- ‘ MATHILDA
Net Like what

LEON my
If he’s far-away ina car let’s say and‘ you know that

it’s going to be raining - then you use plastic

explosives - and set it off from here First yfire

though if ymiss then y’hit the button

MATHLDA 92
And if you cant get clo’ Ghoygh to the car or he
Switches cars

LEON thinks about it

LEON
-Rocket-launcher

MATHILDA

Really

‘(she looks into ‘the street and imagines)
Suppose you miss

on LEON takes a little box out of the violin case
3 He shows MATHILDA a special bullet

LEON
This is a tracer bullet you put it in the rifle and all
you have to do is hit the car - anywhere Then you
leave the rest up to the rocket-launcher
The bullet leads the way for the rocket

MATHILDA
Cool

LEON
“Yeah
Cmon let’s gets some practice

MATHILDA
With real bullets

LEON —
No just dummies fortraining - they leave-a red
mark

MATHILDA settles into position again

‘LEON takes out a pair of binoculars Through the lens MATHILDA looks for a

Ho 37

MATHILDA a
Who should I hit

LEON
- Whoever

“client” She passes over a group of children playing

MATHILDA
No women fo children tight

LEON smiles she’s learned her lesson
- LEON
Don’t try a moving client yet Start with something
easy ‘

She stops on a fat MAN wearing a suit who is sitting on a park-bench reading the New
York Times

MATHILDA
Fatso on the bench

LEON
Perfect

MATHILDA aims and fires A red cartridge hits a plank on the bench The MAN turns
his head and looks at it He doesn’t understand whats happening

’ He starts reading again

LEON
Try again same guy

She shoots again’ Theres a red mark on the other side of the bench
The MAN looks again curiously but has no idea’ what’s going on

LEON looking through the binoculars)

Too far to the left
MATHILDA aims and shoots again

LEON

Bulls-eye
MATHILDA is happy

The at MAN as hg inl ve ot fit

LEON 6 93 Q
Go ahead try a movingoge now

MATHILDA aims ata BUSINESSMAN ‘She chooses the ugliest one she-can find She”
fires Thete’s a red stain on his briefcase

Frightened he runs and hides behind a tree and doesn’t dare to move

LEON
Good First shot

MATHILDA

Yeah but I didnt get ’im- I only hit his briefcase
and now he’s hiding behind the tree What do I do

LEON

Don’t worry about it today’s just training The first
step to finding the bulls-eye is hitting the target to
make you more accurate well use cardboard clients

MATHILDA

OK

LEON 7
Why don’t y’try one of those joggers

MATHILDA looks through the lens and finds a JOGGER

MATHILDA
There the one in pink and orange

LEON
OK

The JOGGER looks like he just changed out of his three-piece suit for an afternoon

LEON hands her another cartridge

- tun MATHILDA firesthree ‘shots that barely miss him he doesn’t hear of see anything

MATHILDA
Shit It’s hard when they’ re moving like that

LEON
Don’t take your eyes off ’im Concentrate Here
teload Keep calm Y’can’tbe nervous Breath —
easy watch his movement

Pretend you’re running with him - - whats his next
move

Take a deep breath hold it breath out Now

39

She shoots and hits him inthe thigh Thinking that he’s covered i in blood he starts to
panic he doesn’t know what to do
From out of nowhere some BODYGUARDS arrive and take care of their client
Obviously this JOGGER isn’t just anyone
LEON watches them through the binoculars oo i
MATHILDA
Y’see that
One shot Not bad eh
I think I got-the-hang-of-it “9

MATHILDA siniles shes very proud of herself But LEON’s a little worried
In the park the BODYGUARDS have taken out their guns but don’t know where the shot
came from

MATHILDA
Can we try a few real bullets

LEON (seriously)
Not today Let’s clean up-

Seriously and quickly MATHILDA packs up

3LEXT SMALL OFFICE BUILDING ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Night has fallen and LEON and MATHILDA are at the entrance of a small office
building

LEON
OK the code

MATHILDA stands next to LEON and waits for the code lesson

’OK there’re two solutions for codes

You gotta choose the one that suits your needs First
case ifyouve have the time you get the code and’
save it for later You wait for night take out your
box of ashes and blow some onto the keyboard

He demonstrates and takes out a screwdriver

«Then you break the little lamp so nobody suspects
anything You wait for soméone to go in then you
go see what numbers were punched Once you have
the four numbers you try all combinations you never
stay longer than a minute - you don’t want to get
spotted - and you only go once an hour

LEON (continued)
Second case if you don’t have time but you cant
afford to be spotted Screwdriver (He unscrews the
a Protective covering) 7
a These wires carry the code there’s always four
wires

A forty year-old MAN comes up the steps
He obviously works there and has forgotten something at the office

MAN Pe
May 1 a)
Are you the new cléagers

LEON steps back)
Uh-huh Excuse me
(to Mathilda) ¢

Let the man through

With his hand on the mess of wires LEON hotwires the box and opens the door
The MAN is about to pass but suddenly stops He realizes that they’re not the new
cleaners LEON is ready to explain

MAN
Excuse me but may I ask what youre doing here
LEON
« I’m teaching her
Youre teaching her to break-into buildings Youd
better leave before I call the police

The MAN nervously searches for something in his briefcase He takes out a can of
mace He doesn’t have time to-use it LEON takesout a silencer and shoots the MAN’s
hand the mace falls The force of the bullet spins the MAN around With the second
shot thisone in the back ’-the MAN falls over the guardrail-and disappears into the
shrubbery without a sound

“ MATHILDA is shocked LEON looks all around while ‘holstering his gun

LEON

So as I was saying y’take the wire from the top of
the plate and try it with the three other wires one by
one os oO
With the second wire the door opens LEON smiles lightly

Easy isn’t it

i MATHILDA nods ‘yes’
ed cad
LEON (continued) g
Whats wrong Youre not goncentrating

MATHILDA 2
Yes Iam

She goes over to the guardrail and looks in the shrubbery
«Incredible Howd ya do that

LEON
Do what

MATHILDA

There the guy how did you do it without a sound

without even touching him It seems like you put

Howd y’do it

LEON (after some time - proudly)
« You like that

— MATHILDA
Amiazing

32 INT MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

‘On the screen Fred Astaire - as always - is cutting loose

LEON (talking about Fred Astaire)
‘Look at the way he moves whatever he says

whatever he does - he never stops Doesn’t matter if

he’s happy or sad he doesn’t stop moving
Fred Astaire does asomersault off of the wall
Look Even off the wall nothing stops him He
uses everything the floor the walls the ceiling -
everything He keeps moving Life is movement

MATHILDA listens attentively

Ce

LEON (continued)
When you trap a mark you have to let him finish the
movement he started That way it’s fair If he
doesnt see it comin’ then he never stops dancing
He doesn’t have time to think about it - and he
doesn’t suffer
He’s gone before he knows it

-He comes and goes in one shot
And when that happens you know that you’ve done a
g00d job

MATHILDA watches the screen her eyes spare

great concentration In record speed LEON reassembles the gun MATHILDA is very
impressed He hands her the gun and she understands that it’s her turn but she has no

idea how to begin

- Inv her little room MATHILDA has begun a collection of cardboard “clients” The firs

MATHILDA is pacing around with a book in her hands LEON is concentrating on a

piece of paper and following the text with difficulty MATHILDA leans over him gently
and corrects a passage

In MATHILDA’s room

The collection of cardboard clients is getting larger Each one has more and more
holes

In the livi
MATHILDA has gotten her way LEON and her exercise in front of the television

MATHILDA instructs LEON how to follow the aerobics trainer on the television and he

He looks around 4 and sees CLIENT 2s briefcase still wet-
Then LEON sees CLIENT 2’s wet shoes under the radiator
Because he didn’t leave

Instantly LEON straightens-up takes out his gun and charges down the hallway
MATHILDA who is stil backed-up against the wall rolis her eyes to make LEON
understand that CLIENT 2 is the bathroom

LEON advances and MATHILDA makes some small gestures - as if shes Playing
“Charades” - to signify the bath and the walkman

LEON takes out his personal periscope bends down and looks into the bathroom with it

’ CLIENT 2’s lying back in the tub with his walkman on faintly we can hear the music

LEON puts away his periscope and stands up

LEON
He’s sleeping -

LEON softly goes into the bathroom MATHILDA follows

The two of them sit on the edge of the tub which is filled with hot water and look at
CLIENT 2 who is snoring lightly

LEON takes out his silencer from his pocket and screws it onto the end of his gun

MATHILDA
It’s weird to go like that
sleepin in the tub with the music

LEON
Its the best
The heavens are kind to him
Now y’understand the importance of timing Ten
minutes earlier or later and he wouldve suffered
He wouldve seen it comin’ - death

‘There Hes already gone without even knowing it

MATHILDA

She gently hangs up the phone
The sun is setting and there’ 8 a yellow haze over New York

The doorbell rings
A BODYGUARD armed to the teeth looks through the peephole undoes the three locks
and opensthe door Two THUGS enter carrying a briefcase

The two THUGS enter the main room
The large CHINAMAN is there with some BODYGUARDS and two white men one of

- them is STANSFIELD’s AGENT MALKY who we saw in MATHILDA’s apartment He

is dressed like all of the other men and does not stand out
The briefcase is opened It’s full of bills A MAN begins to count them

MALKY (to the Chinaman)
Clean bills perfect

At the entrance the large BODYGUARD is concerned about a piece of tissue that’s stuck
in the doorway as if someone had torn his coat walking through it

He holds back aJaugh and approaches thedoor Nobody notices him He Jooks through

the peephole (as ifby rote) then bends down and opens the door slightly in order to pull-
out the cloth

The opening is sufficiently large for LEON’s silencer

The BODYGUARD slowly backs-up LEON enters the apartment and motions the
BODYGUARD to the floor

Then LEON goes into the main room

‘LEON (calmly)
Nobody move please

‘The entire group is shocked The BODYGUARDS don’t move

LEON’s mission is clear kill the fat CHINAMAN

However he’s temporarily distracted’ by the MALKY’s presence

ABODYGUARD takes advantage of this distraction to attack LEON

“But LEON’Stooquitk The BODYGUARD is killed

LEON keeps cool He looks again at AGENT MALKY who is doing his best to be
inconspicuous

LEON addresses the BODYGUARDS who are around the CHINAMAN

LEON
Over there Please

The BODYGUARDS do it but LEON has already shot The CHINAMAN goes down
LEON approaches the CHINAMAN and puts in the security shot

» LEON is really disturbed by MALKY’s presence
Ne LEON turns to leave then tums back around

- LEON (to Malky)
ae Excuse me but don’t I know you from
somewhere

MALKY’s terrified He nods ’no’ as politely as possible

a
MALKY (swallowing his tongue a
I think that I wouldve remembered

LEON (politely)

It’s weird I’m usually pretty good with faces
MALKXY (trying to remain calm)

Thave that ‘ype of face I guess

LEON seems to be satisfied and teady to leave
MALKY doesn’ t dare breath LEON turns back around again

LEON
Say you don’t work for the FBI do you

on Surprised by this Possibility the THUGS and BODYGUARDS all turn towards MALKY

Se oo MALKY (sweating)
No Never

LEON
Are you sure

MALKY
Positive

’ LEON raises his arm and puts the gun barrel to MALKY’s forehead

MALKY (oudly)
Alright ‘slow man
FBI Undercover
I was trying to take him in That’s it
I’ve got nothing to do with the business
You do your job it’s fine with me
OK Look Watch my ‘hand - slow - slow

He opens his Jacket with two fingers and shows that he’s not armed

MALKY
«I’m gonna take out my badge - OK Dont worry

He takes out his badge with two fingers His face is sweating LEON looks at the ne badge
and smiles He was right He lowers his gun

FBI

MALKY puts away his badge

The THUGS and BODYGUARDS are shocked to find that they’ve been infiltrated by the

LEON (smiling) wey

LEON (smiling)
When you see Stansfield again - in hell - tell him

MALKY’s smile vanishes He starts to realize whats going on but its too late
LEON shoots him in the chest The BODYGUARDS start to panic

BODYGUARD (scared)
Hey we ain’t fuckin’ FBI man We’ Te just hired
hands that’s it

LEON realizes that he has lost some of his usual coldness

LEON (to the others)
It’s OK this is beyond the call of duty I’m sorry for

the mess ”

BODYGUARD (faking a smile)
Its nothing man

qe

-LEON
I’m not usually so sloppy

BODYGUARD
Don’t worry well clean it up later It’s nothing

LEON backs-up and heads-out of the apartment stepping over the fat BODYGUARD who
is still lying on the floor

LEON (while eniting)
» Sorry guys “9

LEON

He brushes bythe COP

In front of the stairs at the ‘end of the hallway there’s a small corpse covered by white

He looks at his watch
Two other COPS inconspicuously look around the apartment it’s routine They lift the

MATHILDA has already put-her camera and her teddy-bear-atthe bottom of her bag A
polaroid picture falls on the floor They leave the apartment They take the violin but

LEON comes out with a just a towel around his waist
He comes into the room

LEON
Mathilda

MATHILDA (off)
a Yeah Im in here -I’m coming

LEON goes to the window and looks out

Something has changed him maybe he’s getting tired of everything

He sits down in the armchair ‘He realizes that he’s sitting on MATHILDA’s walkman
He takes it out and puts-on the headphones He tums it on

MATHILDA enters

Shes wearing’ the beautiful dress that LEON gave her Sage

She looks twenty-years old Gy

LEON has his mouth wide open with surprise oe

She smiles and sits down on the arm of the chair He takes the headphones off

MATHILDA takes the glass of milk and drinks half of it

LEON watches her like a child looking at a candy-store window
She gives him back the glass

She looks like a peaceful cat

MATHILDA (softly)
T’m in love with you Leon completely - it’s the
first time that Ive felt it this strong

It’s the first time that I trust a man

I trust you

She caresses his hand
«I love your hands
LEON is uncomfortable and doesnt dare lift his hand

Y’know a girls first time is very important her

first lover
It determines the rest of her life sexually I read that
once in one of my sister’s magazine

LEON tries to maintain his composure

Girls always think the first guy is gonna have gray
hair be all dressed-up nice haircut kinda like
Georgias father - Georgia my friend from school
The type of guy who’salways smiling It’s funny
no trots no

LEON nods ‘yes’ without really knowing what he’s saying yes’ to

’ My friends say that the first time is a nightmare It
hurts all-over afterwards but it’s because they do it
with guys who they’ don’t love

Really they’re just goin’ through the motions and
then they start to like it - like cigarettes

MATHILDA moves closer to him and speaks softly into his ear Their deep breaths
cross each other

i 5 MATHILDA (after a moment)
Nae But me Im gonna love it the first time

LEON closes his eyes He looks a little sad
and I want it to be you my first lover
LEON takes back his hand and licks off the rest of the milk

“He looks at MATHILDA with more sadness than happiness
MATHILDA takes the end of his finger and licks off a drop of milk that he missed
LEON has tears in his eyes

vs LEON stammers a few times before getting out a sentence

LEON

There was someone a longtime ago before I

Her father didn’t want her to see me
My family wasn’t around much

lens
‘That night-I left and came here met-up with my
father and started workin’ for Tony

She gently kisses his face

vee T want you to be the first to touch me the first to
make love to me
Nobody else before you

And nobody after you

She stands up and coyly removes her underwear without taking-off her dress
LEON is about to cry because he can no longer refuse her
MATHILDA is too young but also too beautiful adorable sweet and tender She gently

climbs on top of him

LEON (in tears)
Why me Mathilda why me

MATHILDA ieans over and whispers in his ear

MATHILDA

LEON takes her in his arms

-He’s overwhelmed with happiness and shame he can no longer control himself

It’s incredibie to see ‘such purity and innocence making love
Mal

“ht

It’sa perfectly beautifulmorning like every motning should be

LEON is still in bed It’sthe first time that we’ve seen him in bed and moreover he’s
sound asleep

But like always his gun is by his side One never knows

Oni the other side of the bed MATHILDA watches LEON sleep She has a smile on her
face because he’s s6 cute when he sleeps She starts to move to wake him LEON

instantly sits-up

His arm-reaches for the gun

He sees MATHILDA the room is in utter disarray

MATHILDA smiles

‘MATHILDA puts her hand on his chest and gently stretches-out next to him

MATHILDA
Sleep well

« Ill be right back

LEON oo
Hey don’t forget the code when you get back

‘MATHILDA
OK

LEON
Three knocks then two

She nods yes’ and looks at him tenderly

MATHILDA leaves the apartment LEON sinks into the bed and relaxes
He foids his arms and enjoys the comforts of a bed

MATHILDA returns with the bottles of milk

In the elevator she suddenly finds a hand covering her mouth

Its the hand of the Swat Team CHIEF he’s wearing a bulletproof vest gloves
facemask and has an wzi in his hand Hes not alone

There are seven SWAT team members

SWAT cut i (sofily)
You don’t make a sound you nod ’yes’ or you shake

fee ‘no’ - got it
MATHILDA nods yes’
She quickly understands whats going on
CHIEF 1
‘Ishe alone
Be
She nods ‘yes’ —
- CHEF
Does he expect you

She nods yes’

CHIEF1 4) ye

She nods ’yes’ The CHIEF think for a Moment

CHIEF 1
Deo you have a code - a way of knocking - so that he
knows it’s you

She nods ’yes’
She raises her arm and knocks on the wall two knocks three knocks ‘two knocks The
code is wrong

Nonetheless CHIEF 1 is satisfied
He signals the group to take position SWAT 2 takes MATHILDA down the stairwell
and stays with her

SWAT 2
Don’t be afraid

MATHILDA
Im not afraid

The first three SWATS are in place The CHIEF I is nervous

Everyone is ready He knocks the code on the door

There is no hesitation in the response inside music begins to play

The SWAT TEAM enters commando style one after the other -

From the hallway we see the open apartment door and then a hand at the bottom of the
door shut it quietly

In the hallway the rest of the SWAT TEAM don’t have time to say anything
(Off) We hear the slaughter commence shots and cries for twenty seconds “Then the

door opens again apparently by itself

There are three corpses in ‘the hallway of the apartment meanwhile SWAT 2 radios for
back-up

SWAT 2 (into walkie-talkie)
We got men down here Send back-up immediately

MATHILDA teaches into her shopping bag and pulls-out a gun that she holds by her

Side

On the side of the door we ‘see LEON’s periscope he’s watching the three SWATS i in the
hallway

Two SWATS come down the hallway taking cover with bullet-proof shields

Suddenly LEON’s voice breaks the silence

o

LEON (off screaming)
Mathilda
NOW

From out-of nowhere LEON sweeps the hallway with his Kalashnikov
The three SWATS go down
MATHILDA shoots the SWAT in the hallway and takes SWAT 2 hostage

LEON (loudly)
Mathilda ae

At the end of the hallway MATHILDA sapped in her hostage in one arm ‘and the two
bottles of milk in the other

LEON
Watch your back Turn around

MATHILDA does it and walks backwards
Her hostage stays in front of her and protects her
From the apartment LEON covers her back

Two more SWAT TEAMS rush up the stairs

LEON smashes the old-fashioned fire extinguisher unrolls the hose in the hallway
throws the ax into the apartment and turns-on the water

The hose beats around in the hallway

MATHILDA is almost at the door

The SWAT TEAMS charge up the last stairs at the end of the hallway

LEON opens fire The counter-attack is immediate

Fortunately MATHILDA is behind her hostage whose bullet-proof vest does him little
good

LEON and MATHILDA enter the apartment and shut the door leaving the hostage
crucified on the doorstep

MATHILDA is nervous LEON is focused

MATHILDA
Whats’ with the hose I don’t understand

LEON
Itlikeep em busy for five minutes
How long have they been there

MATHILDA
I dunno five minutes

LEON
The sharpshooters aren’t in place yet

CO

NL

LEON leans against the wall and draws the curtain which lets the Hight i in from the

window
The sharpshooters take pot-shots ‘at the light spots

- LEON
Not five Ten minutes at least -

In the hallway the SWAT TEAM gets control of the extinguisher and shut off the water

LEON ‘grabs the ax and the violin case and they dive into the kitchen
MATHILDA is becoming more and more nervous

“LEON is becoming more and more one

THILDA
4° low are we gonna get out now Leon

LEON

‘Dont worry about it

Were gonna make it
He opens the garbage disposal With the ax he makesthe opening larger
LEON dumps his bag and the violin case (grenades and guns) into the garbage disposal
MATHILDA dumps her teddy-bear and her camera into the garbage

In the haliway the SWAT TEAM has constricted a -sandbag wall All of the SWATS are

all wearing bullet-proof vests andcarrying shields
One takes position with a rocket launcher and fires it

The door explodes and the rocket fills the room with smoke

LEON helps MATHILDA jump into the garbage disposal
Halfway into it she seems to realize something

MATHILDA
But Leon It’s not big enough for you It’s barely
big enough for me

“LEON (smiling)
I know love

MATHILDA begins to cry
‘ MATHILDA

LEON

MATHILDA -

He pushes her MATHILDA falls into the garbage disposal

LEON puts his back against the disposal and bursts into tears

‘He lets out-a tertifying scream

In the hallway the first three SWATS look at each other ‘through their gasmasis and
decide to go through the-demolished doorway

SV

LEON shakes ’no’

’ MATHILDA lands in the garbage
She pops her head out and looksaround theres nobody in sight
She pick-ups the bag and guns and slowly gets up

A wounded SWAT wearing a gasmask exits the apartment in a cloud of smoke
He’s immediately protected and taken care of by his fellow SWATS
They put him on a stretcher

CHIEF 1 40° °
Downstairs joo”
The day’s over for you

CHIEF gives him a friendly pat on the back
The wounded SWAT goes down the stairs to the next level He pauses when he finds the
stairwell literally packed with policemen from top to bottom
The wounded SWAT passes by the other SWATS to the next level
There are SWATS and wails of sandbags all-over making it look like Vietnam
He still hasnt removed his gasmask
Another SWAT sits-him down on a bench and starts to take off his mask
A’ MEDIC arrives and looks at his arm -
The other SWAT takes off his mask It’s LEON
MEDIC
It looks deep lets get you ‘downstairs - theyll take
care of you

CHIEF 2 doesn’t recognize LEON

CHIEF 2
- Youre from the third precinct

LEON nods yes’

MEDIC

Let him catch his breath five minutes
(to Leon)

Y’want me to help yout

LEON a
Lemme wear the mask for a little
I breath better with it

MEDIC

You’re right

Stay there for two minutes
Ill-check-up on you then OK

LEON
OK

CHIEF 2 leaves Everything seems to be in order

There is only one thing that LEON hasn’t noticed STANSFIELD’s AGENT GIFFORD

coming up the stairs who recognized LEON and went back downstairs

2
MATHILDA gets out of the garbage She seeggown the alley that leads to the street

where there are police cars and ambulances -

One SWAT goes towards the kitchen door
A grenade falls in front of him
The explosion rocks the hallway The SwATS are shaken-up

76 INT STAIRWAY - DAY

At a lower level LEON takes advantage of the chaos to leave discretely

He walks down the stairs without any problems

He arrives downstairs and sees down the long hallway leading to broad daylight

SLOW MOTION

But without him realizing it right behind LEON is STANSFIELD

STANSFIELD raises his arm he has agun in his hand
The-barrel ispointed at the-backof LEONs neck

- LEON moves towards the daylight and freedom at the end of the exit

But ‘his vision progressively becomeswhite and the image of daylight slowly fades
without a sound

He has just heard a light dry whistle like a snake
Thescreen fades into pure overexposure then suddenly BLACK

LEON is dead He never saw it coming

MATHILDA is watching from the other building exit
She sees a police OFFICER leaving the building with his arms in the air
He addresses all the other SWATs

OFFICER
That’s it We got ‘im
It’s all over’

The SWAT TEAMS applaud and whistle

MATHILDA standing against the wall is besieged with tears

“STANSFIELD is in the hallway by LEONs feet The different aad) GEES enter and

congratulate him Co
Te
CHIEF 2
Motherfucker Never saw it-coming

FBI AGENT
’ And he was this close to slippin’ through our fingers

STANSFIELD
He’s the one who killed Malky yesterday the
bastard

CHIEF 2 pats him on the back but we feel the bitterness he has also lost many men

CHIEF 2 ©
Nice shot

SLOW MOTION

MATHILDA bolts out of her hiding place She’s carrying LEON’s bag and a silencer

-Her face is stolid like never before

In front of the entrance two SWATS amazed watch her approach them

” It willbe their last expressions
She enters the hallway

At the end of the hallway STANSFIELD is joking with his comrades
MATHILDA approaches the police blanket on the ground
er

She bends down and lifts the edge of it LEON is a bloody mess but his expression is

peaceful
She caresses his cheek

The AGENT ‘taps STANSFIELD on the back The group turns around and sees the girl
at the foot of the corpse

‘MATHILDA kisses LEON on the mouth and covers him up

a

She leaves her gun on the ground

‘She looks STANSFIELD straight in the eyes with a huge smile

STANSFIELD doesn’t understand
MATHILDA takes her hand out of her pocket and throws something to him

‘STANSFIELD catches the flying object

Tt’s a grenade ring
STANSFIELD still doesn’t understand

MATHILDA opens the two sides of LEON’s bag inside there are a dozen grenades

‘The grenade with the missing pin is in the bag

Now STANSFIELD understands
Suddenly there’s a ‘tremendous explosion

The flames blow down the hallway into the street -
Everything is in 90 notion millions of pieces of debris of all kinds shower the street

This rain is dirtier than usual

THE END
