Based on the novel by Alan Glynn

July 12 2006
A BLACK SCREEN

EDDIE (V0)
They’re here

INT CLOSE ON - A HIGH-TECH RESIDENTIAL STEEL DOOR

being POUNDED in WHAM WHAM Whoever’s trying to get in
s serious The door shudders but doesn’t give It’s state-
of-the-art residential protection

EDDIE (V0)
Im guessing I have ten minutes

We hear the WHRRRRR of POWER TOOLS going to work on his door
These people are determined Professional And prepared

EDDIE (V0)
I will never guess how they got past
security in a half-billion dollar
building

EXT THE CELESTIAL - LOOKING INTO THE LOBBY - NIGHT

The sleek lobby is deserted We SEE through the GLASS
lying on the floor the barest glimpse of the FEET of what
are presumably TWO DEAD SECURITY GUARDS -- although their
bodies are largely hidden behind their massive curly walnut
desk All the security monitors are BLACK -- the feeds
clearly cut

The CAMERA RISES breathlessly in a blur up all 80 floors
of this stunning new building coming to rest on

EXT PENTHOUSE - EDDIE SPINOLA

30’s lean and stylish stands on the exterior ledge of his
multimillion-dollar terrace New York City looms around him
beneath him His hands are outstretched Balancing He is
calm but fatalistic He’s clearly going to jump

EDDIE (V0)
I will never let them touch me

His attention is CAUGHT by the SOUNDS of a commotion in the
next apartment He looks over at--

EXT THE ADJOINING TERRACE

Eddie can see opaquely through the gauzy curtains of the

adjoining window TWO MEN backing A MIDDLE-AGED MAN
towards the windows there is arguing
EDDIE (V0)
My neighbor must have opened his door
to complain of the noise

One of the thugs pulls out a GUN coolly shoots the neighbor
through the head It barely makes a sound -- efficiently
silenced The neighbor drops A blur through the curtains
a few seconds pass we hear the SOUNDS of the thugs going
back to work on Eddie’s door

EDDIE (V0)
They’ve become sophisticated Two
months ago they couldn’t have done
this Now my land line’s cut My
cell signal’s jammed

The door is pounded again It doesn’t give

EDDIE (V0)
Still it’s slow going for them
There’s a little more time than I
thought So now I confront the
impossible question the one no man
should ever have to ask himself

The pounding intensifies Eddie jumps down lightly cat-
like and approaches his OUTDOOR BAR

EDDIE (V0)
Which drink should be my last

We HOLD on his back as he surveys the various bottles and we
CUT TO
EXT NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

EDDIE (V0)
Not so long ago this was me

Eddie is walking down the street messily eating a street
falafal His hair is longer his clothes schlumpier his

face rounder -- he’s out of shape A belly bulges against
his belt He wears jeans and that worn-out corduroy
“writers” sport coat -- the one that your girlfriend fights

to give to the Salvation Army
EDDIE (V0)
I was a writer Two years after my
copywriting job at Dexter and Kerr came
to a non-mutual end I had in an
extraordinary burst of desperate
energy bullshitted my way into my
first book contract This was it

INT EDDIE’S RATTY RENT-CONTROLLED APARTMENT ON AVENUE A -
DAY

Eddie slumped in his desk chair is playing COMPUTER
SOLITAIRE

EDDIE (V0)
Now at last I was ready to write

QUICK CUTS --Eddie sprawled on the couch eating takeout
and watching TV the sink in the foreground full of dishes
--Eddie shooting baskets into a toy hoop

EDDIE (V0)
Gearing up that’s all

--Eddie sleeping in his bed sacked out the clock beside him
clicking to 1159

EDDIE (V0)
Getting psyched

--Eddie sitting on the john reading the funnies
EDDIE (VO)

A few days did pass this way maybe

a few months but just in case you

think nothing ever happened to me
INT A MIDTOWN COFFEE SHOP —- DAY
A FEMALE HAND slides a KEY across the counter to EDDIE
A wider shot shows Eddie staring in disbelief at his (now ex)
girlfriend LINDY an attractive real-looking girl about

LINDY
I didn’t think I should keep this

EDDIE
So That’s it

She doesn’t answer can’t Eddie is really hurt and shocked

EDDIE
Thanks for the heads up

LINDY
Like you’re surprised Don’t do
this What do you think all that
ragging and nagging was Eddie User
satisfaction

A beat as he looks at the table Wryly

EDDIE
Youve dropped a few clues

A smile between them -- it is darkly funny He’s made her

laugh that’s part of what’s made her stick

LINDY
Come on does it really matter I’11
never be Melissa

EDDIE
I never think about Melissa

FLASH

INT A BEDROOM —- NIGHT

We are in Eddie’s mind in his POV and we are seeing a
LOVELY WILLOWY BRUNETTE bending seductively over him
wearing an undershirt white powder faintly visible under
nose BACK TO

INT COFFEE SHOP —- DAY
Lindy shoots a look at him
LINDY

I may not have the brain she did but
don’t insult the one I’ve got

her

An awkward pause After a moment he focuses on her outfit

EDDIE
That new

She’s wearing a very sharp suit Italian fashion-forward
LINDY
Yeah Peggy promoted me

EDDIE
You deserve it

A sad smile from him He’s still in her corner

LINDY
Yeah thanks I do
(beat)
I’ve got to get back
EDDIE
(suddenly)

I’m going to give 90 pages to Mark on
Friday if you could just wait see
what he says--

LINDY
Stop You think I don’t know what
you do all day Eddie I’ve loved
you I know the good stuff and I
know the shit

EDDIE
And it’s all shit to you now

LINDY
You’re the one living it You’re the
one it should bother

She gets up throws down a couple of bills

EDDIE
Ill get it

LINDY
Oh please

Like he could afford to pay for anything And he knows that
she knows She kisses the top of his head and goes

Now we can see it On his face He’s miserable

EXT A MIDTOWN STREET —- DAY

Eddie depressed is trudging the long walk back downtown
EDDIE (V0)
That was a day it would have been
nice to roll into a cab and get my
self-pitying ass carted back
downtown which of course was
not a financial option

We DISSOLVE block into block as continues walking

EDDIE (V0)
Of all the absurd relationships
better forgotten and put away in
mothballs is there any more
pointless than the ex-brother-in-
law

A FACE looms into Eddie’s POV

VERNON
Eddie Spinola

VERNON GANT stands on the corner grinning genially blocking
Eddie’s way He is wearing an expensive suit and dark
leather shoes He looks like money

VERNON
Shit It’s gotta be-- 9 years--

EDDIE
Couple Presidents ago yeah

VERNON
(taking him in)
Hey you

He genially whacks the sides of Eddie’s arms Eddie half-
heartedly whacks back Vernon sizes Eddie up

VERNON
Jesus Eddie pack it on why don’t
you

Eddie didn’t need that He’s very self-conscious about his
weight

EDDIE
Sedentary job you know--

VERN
So you’re writing--

EDDIE
Yeah yeah
VERN
And some fool’s paying you

EDDIE
It’s been known to happen
(pointedly)
Still dealing Vernon

VERN
Shit no Look at me Do I look
like I’m dealing

EDDIE
No You look a little pimpy
actually --or that should be
“Pimpified” shouldn’t it -- or maybe
“emPimped”

Vernon giggles not understanding that Eddie means it

VERN
You still crack me up Come on
let’s get a drink--

EDDIE
Nah I should go--

VERN
You can’t tell me you’re a health
nut now Not with that tire--

EDDIE
(annoyed)
Enticing invitation Thanks

Vern plucks the pack of cigarettes from Eddie’s upper jacket
pocket

VERN
Cmon c’mon one beer Or I won’t
give ‘em back

He holds the cigarettes just out of Eddie’s reach

EDDIE
It’s one o’clock in the afternoon
Vern

VERN

When’s that ever stopped you
EDDIE
(sighs)
Fuck

INT BAR - DAY
We face Eddie and Vern as they sit at the bar They look at
each other Vern pleased and Eddie a little awkward Finally

Eddie speaks

EDDIE

VERN
Ah-hah That’s why you agreed to the
beer

EDDIE

I’m making conversation Vern
VERN
Well I don’t know how Melissa is
INT - A BEDROOM - EDDIE’S POV - NIGHT (AN ALMOST SUBLIMINAL
FLASH)

Melissa naked silhouetted in the bathroom door BACK TO

TO
INT BAR - DAY
Eddie trying to keep his voice casual

VERN
Her husband What are you jealous

EDDIE
It’s just a question

VERN
What do you care You guys weren’t
even married six months Were you
It was just a coke thing right

EDDIE
Is that what she said

“A coke thing” It unexpectedly hurt Eddie Maybe it’s just
the bummer day Or there’s a deeper wound then he knew

VERN
--Hey hey no I just thought you

know the two of you went through
about a metric ton that’s all--

FLASH
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
--Melissa naked on top of Eddie her hair whipping his face
as she comes--
INT BAR - DAY

Eddie gets up throws down a couple of bills
VERN
--No look I’m sorry you want to

Eddie freezes He does

EXT A DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY
Eddie and Vern walk

VERN
He’s just some jerk Walked out on
her about two years ago She has
some part time job now I don’t know
what it is some internet “home job”
kind of

Eddie stares straight ahead as Vern’s voice fades down

EDDIE (V0)
Melissa Dumped with two kids I
couldn’t imagine it She’d been so
smart Smarter than anyone around
her And oh how she loved to
provoke people

FLASH

INT A DOWNTOWN PARTY - PARTY - NIGHT

Melissa cigarette in one hand drink in the other is
surrounded by people in intense conversation with a bunch of
prosperous-looking downtown types

MELISSA
--Oh please you think professional
women mentor one another You think
there’s some mutually supportive
empathetic touch-feely network of
kindly pie-bakers --Those bitches
hate each other Quick who was the
worst boss you ever had A woman
right We can’t delegate we can’t
command -- I mean there’s a reason
were not generals--

The men gasp shocked and titillated The women are furious
Melissa smiles to herself -- she’s trying not to crack up

EDDIE (V0)
I thought by now she’d be editing a
newspaper directing movies running
for the Senate

We HOLD ON MELISSA’S LOVELY FACE as her voice fades down and
Vern’s fades in

VERN (V0)
So how are you Eddie

INT — WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

Eddie snaps out of it He and Vern are now sitting ona
bench He didn’t even know where he was

EDDIE
Me

VERN
You

Eddie looks at him with mournful irony a look he frequently
employs

EDDIE
Well I’m behind I’m behind on
my book and it’s pretty well
polluting my days and nights if you
really want to know

VERN
How much’ve you written of it

A beat

EDDIE
Not one fucking word Vern

Vern appraises him

VERN
Creative problem huh I think I
have something that can help you

Vern reaches in his jacket Eddie thinks he knows what Vern
means

EDDIE
Oh no No

VERN
It’s not that--

EDDIE
Youre still dealing

VERN
No-- yeah -- will you listen This
is like nothing you’ve ever done

Ever
(MORE )

I’ve been dRiY ante’ dpnsulting for a
pharmecutical company--

EDDIE
You mean a lab in some little Yalie’s
basement

VERN

No this is an exclusive product
coming on-stream next year they’ve
had clinical trials and it’s FDA-
approved

A long beat Eddie bites

EDDIE
Okay what is it

Vern reaches into his jacket produces a tiny plastic sachet
with his right hand tapping something out into the palm of
his left hand He holds this up for Eddie to see In the
center of it is a tiny white unmarked tablet

EDDIE
What’s in it

Vern puts the little white tablet on the bench

VERN
Just take it

EDDIE
I’m too old for this Vernon

VERN
They’ve identified these receptors in
the brain that can activate specific
circuits and-- you know how they say
you can only access like 20 percent
of your brain or something-- Well
what this does--

EDDIE
Vernon Look at me Do I look good
I smoke too much my chest is sore
A fucking corpse has more energy than
I do I’ve got weird aches possible
lumps rashes maybe they’re a
condition or a network of
conditions One of these days
they’re all going to hold hands
light up and Ill keel over dead

(MORE )

My life’s BDDdie canippér and I DON’T
think it’s going to take a sudden
upswing into the stratosphere if I do
some brand new shiny designer DRUG

Vern’s phone rings He holds up his index finger -- sh --
and takes the call

VERN

(into phone)
Gant

(beat getting agitated)
When --I know but when

(looking at his watch)
Tell him we can’t do that He knows
that’s out of the question We
absolutely can’t do that

Vern is edgy Very tense He continues

VERN
No I’m not going to tell him You
tell him -- no now

He turns off his phone gets up
VERN
Fucking people I’m afraid I’m going
to have to leave you here Eddie

He takes out his business card and places it carefully next
to the little white tablet on the bench

VERN
By the way that’s on the house

EDDIE
I don’t want it Vern

Vern smiles at him
VERN
Don’t be ungrateful now You know
how much these things cost

Eddie shakes his head

VERN
Five hundred bucks a pop

He pats Eddie on the shoulder and goes Eddie is still
looking at the pill Which seems to be looking back at him

EXT A DOWNTOWN STREET —- DAY

Eddie makes his way home a little tipsy pensive and filled
with self-loathing

EDDIE (V0)
Melissa What had happened Her
life made no sense I mean it made
sense that I wasn’t an Internet guru
or a venture capitalist but it
didn’t make sense that Melissa
wasn’t I could see a direct
plausible link between this Eddie
broke and buzzed at three o’clock in
the afternoon and an earlier
Eddie

INT A DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN BEHIND A DESK —- DAY

--getting SPLATTERED by some ochre liquid from an offscreen
source

EDDIE (V0)
--vomiting on his boss’ desk during
a presentation
INT A BEDROOM - NIGHT
A YOUNGER THINNER EDDIE rifles through a bureau
EDDIE (V0)
Or going through a girlfriends
underwear drawer in search of stash
EXT THE STREET - DUSK
Eddie walks pensive
EDDIE (V0)
But there was no link between my
Melissa and this upstate Melissa with
two kids and a shit home job

EXT EDDIE’S DOWNTOWN APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK

Eddie puts his key in the front door lock

EDDIE (V0)
24 blocks later I was home

INT EDDIE’S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DUSK
It’s a former tenement fourth-floor walkup Eddie trudges
up the old stairs the tiny tiles worn away in spots the

Victorian moldings disfigured from a hundred and twenty years
of paint Eddie suddenly stops weary paralyzed

EDDIE (V0)
I was tired And depressed And how
much worse could it get
He digs into his pocket comes up with--

THE LITTLE WHITE PILL

which he clearly did take from the bench The pill sits
teasingly in the palm of his hand looking up at him

EDDIE (V0)
In the end There was just no
reason not to

Quickly impulsively he swallows it

INT THE LANDING — DUSK

As Eddie passes a neighbor’s door swings open Eddie tries
walking faster

EDDIE (V0)
I didn’t want to see anybody

VALERIE 26 and attractive emerges dressed to go out
EDDIE (V0)
Especially not my landlord’s nasty

young wife

She is immediately soured at the sight of Eddie Eddie knows
what she’s thinking

EDDIE
Tuesday

VALERIE
Look enough okay--

EDDIE
Just tell him--

VALERIE
Steve handles the rents So feed
your fucking bullshit to him--

EDDIE (V0)
I was suddenly aware that I had extra
reason to get away from her I had
thoughtlessly ingested a substance

Valerie’s tirade FADES up or down depending on when we’re
hearing Eddie

VALERIE
--Like rent control hasn’t protected
your ass enough You can’t get 585
a month together

EDDIE (V0)
I had gotten remarkably little
information from Vernon about what
this drug would do

VALERIE
You could be a bicycle messenger and
come up with that

Eddie continues up the stairs But she follows getting in
front of him

VALERIE
--Look I’m just telling you he’s
been talking about calling these
people he knows from the club to
muscle you out -- I’ve told him not
to do that but he’s really pissed

We PUSH IN on Eddie’s face into his eyes where we see his
pupils contract just slightly A flicker

EDDIE (V0)
And then I felt it

EDDIE’S POV - THE APARTMENT UPPER HALL
The room is changing springing into sharper focus
EDDIE (V0)

Everything had more definition
more dimensions

There seems to be a little more light too -- he can see more
clearly The SOUND drops out for a moment he can see
VALERIE’S FACE mouth contorted continuing to heap the
abuse but there’s something in her eyes that’s not mean
something anxious

EDDIE (V0)
“I was blind but now I see”

He looks at her with a sudden keen intelligence And
sympathy

EDDIE
What’s wrong

She’s taken aback

VALERIE
W-What

EDDIE (V0)
Now I noticed her tense fingers
and defeated look

His eyes go to THE BOOK BAG in her arms On a gut instinct
Eddie takes a shot pushing his words forward with a new
sharp penetrating intimacy articulateness

EDDIE
You don’t like me and I don’t blame
you -- you see a retrograde

collegiate schlumpy energy-sucking
defeated sack of shit sponging off
your husband You’re hoping I’11
blow my brains out But my existence
shouldn’t make you this upset What
is it

He’s hit a nerve

VALERIE
Look that’s none of your--

EDDIE
Something wrong with school

VALERIE
How do you know I’m in school

His eyes flick down at her bag

EDDIE
People who aren’t don’t usually carry
dry academic constipated out of
print books about Dorothea Lange--

VALERIE
Are you some kind of sickie Have
you been following me

EDDIE
No I just saw the book--

VALERIE
You can only see a corner of it How
did you know

He looks down She’s right -- only a corner of the book is
visible Eddie realizes

EDDIE
I’ve seen it before

EDDIE (V0)
It was true 15 years ago In
college

INT A COLLEGIATE DORM - NIGHT
Young skinny Eddie is flipping through the Lange book

EDDIE (V0)
-Sitting on the couch of a TA I
was trying to make waiting for her
to come back out of the bathroom
Hoping she’d put in her diaphragm

BACK TO

INT EDDIE’S APARTMENT - LANDING —- DAY

EDDIE (V0)
Somehow my unconscious had served
that up a memory long forgotten
never even recorded Or was it
recorded there all the time and all
Id needed was the access

ON EDDIE’S FACE —- CLOSE

As it sinks in

EDDIE (V0)
Vern was right This was like no
drug Id ever known

Eddie’s eyes flicks to the laptop in her bag his manner
suddenly intimate confident

EDDIE
If you’re writing a paper that’s not
the book Id use

VALERIE
Well who asked y--

EDDIE

Cal Berkeley has her oral history
Id start there Her sons are still
alive You could Google them Sons
of famous people always want to dish
dirt about their parents You’d get
something no one else has and
you’d’ve gone the extra mile a nice
little apple for the professor

During this speech MUSIC COMES UP and the sound goes down
SEVERAL QUICK CUTS Eddie and Valerie’s mouths are
moving she’s asking questions he’s supplying answers
lots of them

EDDIE (V0)
Information culled from the odd
museum show a half-read article a
once-aired documentary was all
bubbling obligingly up to my
frontal lobes mixing itself together
into a sparkling cocktail of useful
information

Valerie’s whole posture is relaxing the look in her eyes
becoming friendly

EDDIE (V0)
She didn’t have a chance
INT THE DOWNSTAIRS APARTMENT FROM EDDIE’S - NIGHT
A mirror image of Eddie’s but considerably nicer We HEAR

the SOUNDS of two people -- Valerie and Eddie -- HAVING WILD
mutually satisfying SEX from the other room

EDDIE (V0)
We’d worked on her paper for about
two hours

We see the laptop set up books scattered -- then obviously
abandoned for a more pleasurable pursuit

EDDIE (V0)
One nice little side effect I
stayed hard for hours

We HEAR female groans of pleasure Laughter

INT EDDIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

EDDIE (V0)
Half the night later I returned
home

A dishevelled Eddie opens the door to his apartment He
enters looks around

EDDIE’S POV - HIS LIVING ROOM

It’s the first wide shot we’ve seen of it and it hammers
home what a mess Books scattered across the floor dirty
dishes broken Venetian blind sashes The nest of a slob

EDDIE (V0)
-- but it couldn’t be my home could
it Who would live like this

MONTAGE Speeded-up shots of Eddie sifting through his books
and tapes Cleaning up the kitchen The bathroom Picks up
books He starts moving the sofa QUICK CUTS the living
room rapidly whipped into shape If not stylish habitable
Final shot he’s sitting on the (repositioned) couch
Thinking

EDDIE (V0)

What was this drug I couldn’t stay
messy on it I hadn’t had a cigarette
in six hours

He stares at the pack in his hands It looks alien

EDDIE (V0)

I also hadn’t eaten So I’d been
abstemious and tidy So what was
this -- a drug for people who wanted
to be more anal-retentive

He gets up Paces

EDDIE (V0)
I wasn’t high I wasn’t wired
Everything was just very clear What
I needed to do And the surge of
electric energy pulsing in my
brain to make me do it

His eye falls on his COMPUTER

The MONTAGE CONTINUES Eddie flipping through research
books typing onto his keyboard the printer printing doing
Internet searches pages and pages spit out of the printer

EDDIE (V0)
Soon ninety-two pages just wrote
themselves

INT EDDIE’S BEDROOM —- MORNING

Eddie in his underwear is sleeping soundly He stirs
rolls over cracks open an eye

He gets up schlumps to the mirror looks at his unshaven
face The penetrating gleam is no longer in his eyes

EDDIE (V0)
The next morning I sent a little
probe down into my brain No surge
of brilliance came up to greet me I
felt dull thick needing coffee and
a cigarette In short

INT EDDIE’S CLOSET

His UNDERWEAR get tossed at the hamper -- missing the hamper
by about a foot The underwear remain on the floor

EDDIE (V0)
I was back
INT EDDIE’S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Eddie sits at his table eating doughnuts (Already the room
shows signs of being messed up again)

EDDIE (V0)
But something remained

His eye falls on the NEAT STACK of the 93 PAGES he’d written
the night before He picks them up Looks at them

INT AN EDITORS OFFICE —- DAY

A windowless cubicle Eddie drops A MANILA ENVELOPE
containing the pages on the desk of MARK SUTTON 40 an
editorial lifer He looks dubiously at Eddie then the
pages

MARK
Youre kidding

EDDIE
No

MARK
(sarcastic)
Words have appeared on paper

EDDIE
Yes

MARK
Written by you

Eddie knows he’s on thin ice

EDDIE
Hey no pressure Just call me when
you’ve read them

INT A MOVIE THEATER - DAY
We see the flicker of a movie screen on Eddie’s face

EDDIE (V0)
Had a couple hours to kill so I
caught a flick

We HEAR the voices from the screen

HEAVY’S VOICE
(European accent)
There is no vaccine Once I break
the vial your “Eastern Seaboard”
will be permanently contaminated

DANIEL CRAIG’S VOICE (V0)
Well Cape Cod is overrated

We HEAR the Oofs Thuds and loud music that signifies Mr
Bond has attacked the enemy Eddie chuckles He loves this
shit

INT EDDIE’S APARTMENT - DAY - ON EDDIE’S ANSWERING MACHINE

The red light is blinking Eddie pushes “Play” Mark
Sutton’s voice is heard upbeat

MARK SUTTON’S VOICE
Eddie give me a call when you get
in (BEEP)

The second message is from Mark too

MARK SUTTON’S VOICE
Eddie I’m 40 pages further in
call me how did you do this I’d
uh Id really like to talk to you
about your plans for after you
finish I’m wondering if this maybe
should be one of a series of books
look the minute you get in call
Okay Okay (BEEP)

Eddie smiles to himself -- he knew it But them his smile
fades Reality hits Because it was an enhanced Eddie who
displayed all that brilliance now wasn’t it

EXT VERN’S APARTMENT BUILDING —- DAY

Eddie holding Vern’s card buzzes the buzzer There’s no
answer Eddie buzzes again and again Finally

VERN’S VOICE
(groggy)
Yeah

EDDIE
Vern It’s Eddie

VERN’S VOICE
Yeah yeah okay

The buzzer buzzes

INT VERN’S APARTMENT DOOR —- DAY

The door opens And Eddie is taken aback

Vern has been beaten up Really worked over His lip is
split his face puffy and bruised His right hand is
bandaged

VERN
Shit Eddie that was fast

EDDIE
What hap--

VERN
Don’t ask

Leaving the door open Vern turns around and motions at Eddie
with his left hand to come in

The place is all mismatched antique furniture -- the
possessions of someone who collected once with enthusiasm
but who’s letting it all go to hell Vern sits keeping his
injured arm elevated

VERN
So Eddie I guess you’re interested
after all

EDDIE
Yeah That stuff’s amazing

VERN
What did I tell you

Eddie can’t get over how bad Vernon looks

EDDIE
Vern--

VERN
You don’t want to know

End of subject And Eddie wants the drug more than he wants
to know what happened

EDDIE
What’s um what’s it called

VERN
It doesn’t have a street name yet
because it doesn’t have a street
profile And that’s the way we want
it to stay The boys in the kitchen
are calling it MDT-48

EDDIE
“The boys in the kitchen” Vern
that doesn’t sound like something
that’s FDA-approved

VERN
“FDA-approved” that’s a laugh Did
you really believe that shit

Eddie stares at Vern as he pours himself a coffee

EDDIE (V0)
Okay so what did we have here Some
unknown untested possibly dangerous
pharmaceutical scammed out of an
unidentified lab somewhere given to
me by an unreliable person I hadn’t
seen in a decade

VERN
So You want some more of this

EDDIE
Yes Definitely

Vern chuckles He knew it

VERN
Okay uh we’ll get into it
(beat)
But you want to do me a little favor
first
EDDIE
Uh sure

Eddie wants to get on with it and get out of there but Vern
clearly has him by the balls

VERN
As you can see I’m in no shape to go
out right now but I need to later

Will you hop down to the dry cleaners
and get my suit And maybe pick me
up some breakfast too

Eddie sighs Vern tosses him a set of KEYS

INT A DRY CLEANER’S AUTOMATED CLOTHING RACK —- DAY

As the plastic-wrapped clothes spin towards us

EDDIE (V0)
I was amazed at how quickly it all
slotted back into place

INT A DINER GRIDDLE - DAY
As two eggs are flipped over easy

EDDIE (V0)
the dealer-client dynamic

INT VERNON’S BUILDING - HALLWAY —- DAY

And here comes Eddie carrying Vernon’s suit and greasy bag
of breakfast

EDDIE (V0)

this easy sacrificing of dignity
for a guaranteed return of a dime
bag or a gram or in this case a
little pill that was going to cost me
a month’s rent

He arrives at Vernon’s door He takes out the keys Vern gave
him but he doesn’t need them The Door is AJAR

INT VERN’S APARTMENT - DAY - EDDIE’S POV

As Eddie pushes the door open he can see Vernon sitting
quite normally on the couch As we enter the room though
we look around and see that the place has been RANSACKED
Destroyed

Eddie wheels back to ask Vern what the fuck And then sees
it

VERN’S FACE - CLOSE

In the center of his forehead is a neat little BULLET HOLE
EDDIE

is no tough guy and sweat springs to his brow He starts
shaking then seized with horror that they might still be

in here he edges to the bedroom We hear THE POUNDING OF
HIS HEART as he peeks in

INT EDDIE’S POV - VERN’S BEDROOM

It’s been ransacked too Torn to shreds bureau drawers

But no one is there

Eddie’s shaking hand can barely hold the phone

EDDIE
Yes I I need to report a
murder Eddie Spinola --Edward

J I wont

He puts down the phone puts his head in his hands VARIOUS
CUTS OF Eddie sitting Shifting his butt in various
positions Holding a BASEBALL BAT he’s found -- just in case
“they” come back

EDDIE (V0)
It took them forever And the longer
I sat there the clearer I saw
whoever had done this had known Vern
He had opened the door And I
suddenly knew what they had been
looking for

CLOSE ON - EDDIE’S FACE
EDDIE (V0)

And I couldn’t help but wonder if

they’d found it
INT VERN’S BEDROOM - DAY
Eddie cleverly wearing kitchen gloves is now furiously
tearing through the rubble the thieves have left behind the
scattered clothes under the bed

INT BATHROOM - DAY

Eddie pokes quickly through the medicine cabinet -- nothing
but Tylenol

INT VERN’S LIVING ROOM —- DAY

Eddie lies on the floor exhausted the room even further
trashed than it was before

EDDIE’S POV - THE CEILING
It’s made of many interlocking panels And one of them is

a little crooked We HEAR SIRENS now -- the cops are finally
coming and Eddie must rush CUT TO

EDDIE

standing on a chair poking at the panel It gives pops
upward His arm disappears into the hole he feels
around his expression changes and his arm reappears
containing

A LARGE BROWN PADDED ENVELOPE

Slowly Eddie pulls out the package reaches into it
EDDIE’S HANDS - CLOSE

He is holding about TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in cash

But that’s not all He reaches in again there’s something
else inside

Eddie’s hand pulls out a LITTLE BLACK ADDRESS BOOK But
there’s still something else he reaches in again

And now Eddie’s hand pulls out A PLASTIC CONTAINER WITH AN
AIR-LOCK SEAL he pries the seal off

Inside are FIVE HUNDRED OF THE LITTLE WHITE PILLS

Eddie HEARS THE THUD OF APPROACHING FEET voices Making a
decision he quickly tucks the envelope into his jacket
jumps down from the chair and repositions it as THE
FOOTFALLS get closer

INT POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

Eddie sits finishing up his statement to an overweight
DETECTIVE

EDDIE
-- I’d just run into him on the
street and he invited me up to to

chew over old times

The Detective looks at him suspiciously

DETECTIVE
“Chew over old times”

EDDIE
Is there something wrong with that

EDDIE (V0)
The brown envelope was burning a hole
in my side But because I’d been a
good samaritan and called right away
nobody had thought to search me

DETECTIVE
And what exactly did he do for a
living

EDDIE
When I knew him he was an antique
dealer

DETECTIVE

A dealer--
EDDIE

Oh look I don’t know we didn’t

exactly get a chance to catch up

The phone is ringing The detective picks it up
DETECTIVE
(into phone)
Yeah That is correct An Edward
Spinola He’s here

Mysteriously the Detective hands the phone to Eddie

DETECTIVE
We contacted the victim’s sister

Eddie sees young beautiful Melissa laughing in the surf

INT POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

Eddie can’t believe it He stares at the phone
EDDIE
That’s Melissa

EDDIE (VO)
I hadn’t heard her voice in 10 years

He looks into the receiver then finally speaks into it

EDDIE
Melissa

MELISSA’S VOICE
Eddie You were there

EDDIE
Right before I’d just run into him
on the street

MELISSA’S VOICE
Christ
(broken)
This is all so weird

EDDIE
Melissa -- you don’t think I had
anything to--

MELISSA’S VOICE
Oh no no Eddie I know that I
wish I was more surprised He was
involved in some stuff I better
not say any more

EDDIE
Not on this line no

A beat Eddie still can’t believe he’s talking to her

EDDIE
Melissa maybe we should just
(a deep breath)
Do you want to meet somewhere
or

He lets it hang in the air for a moment

MELISSA’S VOICE
Eddie I’ve got to do the funeral
And God knows what else

EDDIE
Right Do you uh do you want any
help I feel like I should--

MELISSA’S VOICE
No better not I’11 call you
again when I’ve processed Okay

EDDIE
Okay

A beat Melissa’s voice is wan vulnerable

MELISSA’S VOICE
Okay

She’s hung up Gone

EDDIE (V0)
93 pages a murder and a talk with

Melissa What a 24 hours --And
now the looming possibility of my
arrest

The detective still staring intently at Eddie

DETECTIVE
Something doesn’t jell here

But he suddenly breaks his gaze eyes drifting towards the
snack table where there are pastries and doughnuts

EDDIE (V0)
But I knew when his attention
wandered to something more pressing
that he was going to let me go

EXT PRECINCT — DAY

Eddie walks down the stairs shaken up but profoundly
relieved Even a little giddy Then he stops

EDDIE (V0)
Only then did it occur to me that
someone might have followed me from
Vern’s apartment

EXT THE STREET -—- DAY

Eddie walks trying to cast inconspicuous glances over his
shoulder

EDDIE’S POV - THE STREET

innocuous They all look threatening He has no idea

chance and go home

closes the door behind him
INT EDDIE’S DINING TABLE - DAY
The cash the address book and the bottle of pills are all
laid out on the table Eddie sits looking at them
realizing that his life is now about to be jump-started

A smile twitches at the corner of his mouth

MUSIC UP UNDER

EXT MADISON AVENUE —- DAY
Eddie is walking down the street a brisk confidence in his
step that penetrating gleam of intelligence back in his
eyes We know right away that he’s on MDT
EDDIE (V0)

Back on MDT now hyper-aware it

seemed obvious what my immediate

undertakings should be
EDDIE’S POV - THE CHIC STORE WINDOWS - MENS’ CLOTHES

We know it’s all his for the taking

EXT CENTRAL PARK SOUTH —- DAY

Eddie is walking now elegantly and expensively dressed

EDDIE (V0)
Vern’s cash combined with an
unprecedented surge of motivation
enabled me to do something about my
appearance

INT A GYM - NIGHT
Eddie who has had a haircut is doing crunches on a board
EDDIE (V0)
The idea of a burger a fry a
congealed doughnut nauseated me now

I learned to read music in a week

INT THE EAST RIVER —- DAY

Eddie runs earphones on his head We HEAR dimly French
phrases

EDDIE (V0)
Brushed up on French and Italian

Eddie becomes aware that there’s ANOTHER RUNNER -- a powerful-
looking man gaining on him closer behind him than makes him
comfortable Eddie flicks a glance over his shoulder

EDDIE (V0)
The only cloud was the oppressive
feeling that I was being followed

With a surge of effort Eddie speeds up sprinting across the
street just after the light changes WHIZZING TRAFFIC cuts
the mysterious runner off stops him from following He
remains panting at the light

EDDIE (V0)
Was I Or was MDT a creator of
groundless paranoia

INT EDDIE’S APARTMENT - DAY - (SERIES OF SHOTS)

EDDIE (V0)
Either way I wasn’t taking any
chances The focal point of my
existence quickly became
protecting my stash

SEVERAL SHOTS as Eddie tries then rejects several HIDING
PLACES 1 He lifts the mattress then stops himself
Please 2 He lifts the lid on the toilet then puts it back
in disgust Bad narc movie 101 3 He peers behind the
radiator lifts a potted plant out of its pot then puts it
back -- nope

EDDIE (V0)
No place seemed safe

Finally 4 Eddie leans down pulls the old rusty BROILER
out of his aged stove Hm

EDDIE (V0)
Being as I didn’t spend much time
browning creme brulees I finally
settled for the broiler

CLOSE ON 1 the plastic baggie of pills being DUCT TAPED
inside the top of the broiler

EDDIE (V0)

INT A BAR - NIGHT

Eddie stands there in his new clothes noticeably thinner
holding a drink There is something commanding about his
aura ATTRACTIVE WOMEN check him out

EDDIE (V0)
I seemed to no longer repel women

The CAMERA CIRCLES around Eddie and a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

EDDIE (V0)
(playfully)
So you’re saying that any author
who’s commandeered adjective status
“Orwellian Dickensian--

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
--is prosaic Yes

EDDIE
And you would agree that a prosaic
author’s work rests on a foundation
of acclaim--

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
Or zeitgeist--

EDDIE
So you’re saying praise and fame are
unrelated to achievement that the
greatest hits CD cannot possibly
contain good songs That
Shakespeare’s catchiness belies
mediocrity

(MORE)

-- Really EDDdaicantittbresting -- I
mean what is the fine line between
something that resonates timelessly
and the dull thud of a cliche

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
I

She breaks off shrugs smiles He’s fascinating
EDDIE
So knowing your abhorrence of
populist sloganeering I take it
youd really rather not hear about
what I personally think could
launch a thousand ships

He puts a finger under her chin He means her face of
course The woman smiles and blushes

EDDIE (V0)
Fish in a barrel

As the CAMERA CONTINUES TO CIRCLE WE CUT TO

INT ANOTHER BAR - ANOTHER NIGHT

As the CAMERA in an unbroken movement is now circling around
him as a European-looking crowd clusters around Eddie

He is finishing a long story -- in French
The crowd laughs appreciatively Especially the women
EDDIE (V0)
And it wasn’t just women I was for
the first time in my life

interesting

The CAMERA CONTINUES its circle

INT ANOTHER UPSCALE BAR —- NIGHT

And the movement continues in a third bar Now a sizable
crowd is around Eddie

EDDIE
--but wouldn’t that rapid expansion
devalue the stock completely in two
years

A well-dressed BROKER TYPE (Kevin Doyle) shakes his head

BROKER TYPE
No no there are safeguards--

EDDIE
Against aggressive over-expansion
There aren’t because there are no
safeguards in human nature When it
comes to power we have no “off”
button we’ll gobble up whatever
territory booty dinero we can and
well keep gobbling -- we’ll inflate
until the balloon pops --I mean look
at history the countries that ruled

the world -- they all overreached --
Portugal -- All that’s left is salt
cod and cheap condos -- the Brits--

Now they just sit on their dank
little island fussing over their
suits --But you’re saying a
corporation’s going to put on the
brakes Say “Ahhh that’s enough
We’1l stop at a couple billion”

The crowd laughs Eddie’s tone hasn’t been aggressive --
it’s been genial amusing Even the Broker type smiles
sheepishly

EDDIE (V0)
Even the people I beat forgave me

EXT THE BAR - NIGHT

Eddie leaves with several people The Broker Type who we
will now know as Kevin presses a card into Eddie’s hand

KEVIN DOYLE
You must have a portfolio but if you
don’t I’d be very interested in
working with you

Eddie politely takes his card Smiles charmingly

EDDIE
Thank you so much

EDDIE (V0)
Of course this seemed to work better
with people I didn’t know than
with people who knew me

INT A MODEST QUEENS LIVING ROOM —- DAY

Eddie’s MOTHER and FATHER working class schlubs sit on the
floral sofa staring at their now-dapper son

EDDIE
--So Mom I did a little research
about Aunt Helen’s tumor and her
treatment is the medical equivalent
of slathering the patient with
leeches There is one doctor at
Johns Hopkins who is too dim to do
this himself -- but he does knows
the people in Switzerland who are
experimenting with non-invasive
lasers and I’ve gotten her on the
list

His parents stare at him They don’t know what to make of
any of this

EDDIE (V0)
I quickly returned to the unfamiliar
audience

INT MARK SUTTON’S OFFICE — DAY

Eddie sits in a chair opposite Mark’s desk Another ELEGANT
MAN is there too Mark’s boss DUNHAM

MARK SUTTON
I want to apologize Eddie if I in
any way communicated a lack of faith
in your abilities

Eddie smiles coolly In control It’s Mark who’s a little
nervous

MARK SUTTON
Mr Dunham has read your pages and
were prepared to make you what I
hope will be a very exciting offer

EDDIE
I might disappoint you there

MARK SUTTON
Why
EDDIE
Because I ah now see that writing
as a profession is for marginalized
whiners not fit for anything else

Sutton thinks Eddie’s kidding He laughs nervously

EDDIE
No I mean it look at the life
Incarceration loneliness burrowing
down into your own psyche
increasingly insulated from any
truth because you’re not in the
currents of the world any more
youre rattling around inside the
cage of your brain self-
cannibalizing

Dunham realizes he may be losing Eddie and jumps

DUNHAM
You don’t think a best-selling author
would disagree

EDDIE
Oh if you’re good there’s some
remuneration eventually after
paperbacks but at best your
career’1ll be oozing along like a
snail a few thousand more copies
whoop-dee-doo you’re “developing a
readership” -- for what So you can
end up in Phoenix on a Saturday night
reading from your own work at some
holdout indie book store to a bored
audience of ten --Half of them
there for the wine and cheese

Mark Sutton stares at him confused

MARK SUTTON
But ah I understood that being a
writer was your life what in the
world would you do instead

Eddie looks away from them into the future

EDDIE
I don’t think any goal will be really
clear Mark until I’m sitting ona
large pile of cash

in

MARK SUTTON
And exactly how will you get that

Eddie smiles to himself He’s thought of this

INT BOB HASKELL’S APARTMENT - DAY

BOB HASKELL an intense-looking middle-aged man wearing a T-
shirt and boxer shorts answers the door Eddie is standing
there

EDDIE
Kevin Doyle did call you

BOB
Oh uh yeah Sorry come in

Eddie enters taking it all in The room largely empty
dominated by a large mahogany table -- once a dining table --
now covered with computers and printers Bob immediately
starts typing into a keyboard pulling distractedly at his
shorts with his free hand

BOB
Lair of the beast so you’1ll have to
excuse the uh attire

EDDIE

It’s your apartment Bob

There are grooves in the carpet where the chairs used to be
and a couple of faded spots on the walls where pictures once
hung

EDDIE
Recent divorce

BOB
Three months So you’re writing an
article

EDDIE
(smoothly)
Vanity Fair Day Trading 101 Kevin
said you were the guy

Bob is intent on the screen

BOB
Mm-hm Mm-hm Okay nothing’s
moving Rigid as a corpse
(finally looking at Eddie)
(MORE)

So EddieBOB(qenghitd) When you buy a
share of stock there’s three
approaches There’s fundamental
analysis you look at the company’s
financial health growth potential
potential earnings--

ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER
Bob is still talking and keying at the same time

BOB
- but another approach is to look
at numbers only no real connection
to current valuation That’s
quantative analysis or “quants”
You use sophisticated algorhythms to
find minute price discrepancies

ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER
Bob is still talking and keying

BOB
then there’s technical analysis
you study price-and-volume patterns
and basically try to understand the
psychology surrounding a stock

His eye drifts towards the screen Without saying “excuse
me” he starts to key in numbers again

EDDIE (V0)
He talked about options futures
derivatives hedge funds global

markets and I found that I
actually understood what he was
saying

Bob’s voice fades back up

BOB
Then you’ve got guys like me the new
pariahs of Wall Street Ten years
ago it was the Gordon Gekkos Now
it’s the geeks in baseball caps who
sit in front of computers at home and
pick off eighths even sixteenths of
a point per share we’re accused of
distorting the market Tough shit
I mean come over here look at
this

Eddie comes closer as Bob keys feverishly After a moment

BOB
Yes

EDDIE (V0)
He’d bought at 59 and 716ths and
sold at 59 and 1116ths

BOB
Five hundred dollars in ten seconds
EDDIE
How many trades like that do you make
a day
BOB

Thirty forty I rarely hold a stock
for more than ten minutes

EDDIE
So it’s really not about
information is it

BOB
Shit no

EDDIE
It’s about identifying ripples in the
charts and reacting quickly

BOB
There are some very good simulation
games you can buy

Eddie is staring at the screen blocks of information forming
and connecting in his mind

EDDIE
I don’t think I’1l be needing them

Bob tears himself away for a moment looks at Eddie

BOB
Eddie Watch yourself Trading can
get intense Don’t ever borrow money
from family or friends and don’t
start lying to hide your losses
either

Eddie’s mind is already dancing ahead -- to the money he’s
going to be making

EDDIE
Got it Bob

BOB
And uh make sure you keep a foot in
your life you know if you you
start getting irritable when you
can’t trade like on a Sunday Or
in the middle of the night You
may need some counseling

Of course the poor desperate man is talking about himself

INT EDDIE’S APARTMENT — DAY

Financial reading material covers every square inch of floor
Eddie now has three monitors operating side-by-side in his

living room all spewing forth financial information as he
works the keyboard

EDDIE (V0)
Armed with the last 200000 of poor
Vern’s money I made 1200000 ina
day

(beat)
It was too slow

INT A COFFEE SHOP —- DAY

Eddie sits across from a sinister-looking young Russian in
his early 30’s This is GENNADY

EDDIE
Why not

The two men stare at each other

GENNADY
Because I don’t see you before And
I don’t fucking like you already
Why do I give you 100 thousand
dollars

EDDIE
I thought all you Russians were big
shots In control

GENNADY
What -- I not in control I turn you
down

He gets up ready to walk dismiss this

EDDIE
Then I’1l have to model the script
on someone else

Gennady looks at him contemptuously but bites

GENNADY
What script

INT WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK —- DAY
Eddie sits on a bench waiting

EDDIE (V0)

An hour later I’d spun a plot about
a young second-generation Russian who
finds himself moving up through the
Organizatsya

Gennady appears Hands Eddie a large paper bag Eddie
reaches for it Gennady holds it aloft for one last second

GENNADY
Okay you take this you mine You
don’t pay you know what we do

EDDIE (V0)
He was determined to tell me

GENNADY
We cut you around the waist peel
your skin pull it up over your head
and tie knot in it And you don’t
die from that You suffocate

He lets the full picture sink in for a moment Then

GENNADY
Okay So who we cast in this thing

INT LAFAYETTE TRADING FIRM - DAY

EDDIE (V0)

My new friend Kevin Doyle told me
that you could leverage two and a
half times your cash at a day-trading
firm

Eddie now sits at a terminal KEVIN DOYLE behind him (We
may recognize Kevin as the broker type who gave Eddie his
card in the earlier bar scene) Kevin is watching Eddie a
little mystified

INT LAFAYETTE TRADING - BATHROOM —- DAY

Eddie is alone in a stall He takes TWO MDT TABLETS out of
his wallet downs them

EDDIE (V0)
Id been upping the dose for over a
week It seemed to cut my learning
curve

OVERLAPPING DISSOLVES Another trader stands behind Eddie
watching Second shot three traders are watching Third
shot nine traders are watching him awed

EDDIE (V0)
It was instinct But informed
instinct -- instinct based on huge
amounts of research which thanks to
MDT was conducted more rapidly and
comprehensively than anyone at
Lafayette Day Trading would ever
realize

Kevin Doyle is flabbergasted as he watches Eddie
OVERHEAD SHOT OF ROOM -- “GOD SHOT”-—
As still more people drift over to where Eddie is sitting

EDDIE (V0)
Id heard the old metaphors about the
stock market -- it was an ocean a
celestial firmament a numerical
representation of the Will of God

EDDIE - CLOSE
eyes taking in data fingers reacting on the keyboard

EDDIE (V0)
But that was half-assed The stock
market was nothing less than a
template for human consciousness a
collective nervous system a global
brain

(MORE )

And I was ®ddd cont bbpted up-- my
mind was living tissue inside the
greater functioning whole

TRADER BEHIND HIM
Why are you shorting that

Eddie half-smiles shrugs He doesn’t owe the guy an answer

EDDIE (V0)
Call it raving grandiosity brought on
by the drug But the fact remains

EXT LAFAYETTE DAY TRADING BUILDING - DAY
Eddie exits cool and collected And satisfied

front of his building No one gets in or out Eddie turns
back to his machine

EDDIE (V0)
»and finally Kevin Doyle trying
to sound casual

KEVIN DOYLE
Eddie I was having drinks with a
friend of mine and he said he’d
like to meet you

INT A FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT —- NIGHT

Lindy Eddie’s ex-girlfriend is sitting across the table
from Eddie She peers at him confused Is this dapper
stranger really her shlumpy ex

LINDY
Carl Van Loon wants to meet you

EDDIE
Apparently he does

She is pleased for him but flabbergasted

LINDY
But you’re not really in the
finance game What can you do for
Carl Van Loon
(shaking her head
mystified)
Eddie-- I --

THE BEAUTIFUL HOSTESS appears at Eddie’s side

HOSTESS
Signori Spinola Giorgio says that
the first white truffle of the season
is in

EDDIE
(in Italian)
I naturally would like to smell it

Lindy absorbs this even more confused as the hostess goes

LINDY
All right What’s happened to you

EDDIE
You make it sound like something I
couldn’t make happen for myself

EDDIE (V0)
I was careful with her to take it
down a few notches Cruise on a
lower speed

LINDY
No I don’t mean I mean I knew
you could rally but I just

EDDIE
You didn’t think I would

Lindy will always be honest with him

LINDY
No
(beat)
I hope you didn’t do it for me
Eddie

EDDIE
No I did it for me Apparently my
capacity for self-disgust wasn’t
boundless after all

LINDY
I’m so happy for you And I’m so
sorry if I seemed disloyal or
EDDIE

(beat)
Lindy There was no betrayal from
you Ever The real question is
how did you put up with that lump

LINDY
Well even at your worst there was
a certain teddy bear quality

EDDIE
Teddy bears are round and soft and
certainly incapable of inflicting
their will on the world

Lindy eyes this new sharp Eddie still the tiniest bit
uncomfortable

LINDY
Well But they’re comforting

They regard each other The waiter reappears with a plate
containing a dirty-looking golf ball Eddie leans forward
and snifs He suavely nods approval

EDDIE (V0)
Of course we started up again

INT LINDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Eddie is making out with her on her couch
EDDIE (V0)
Her place

INT EDDIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

EDDIE (VO)
My place

The place has been seriously transformed Of course it’s
nothing but a renovated tenement but there are some new
furnishings rugs lighting-- the total effect is now one of
stylish prosperity

She and Eddie sit on the rug in front of the coffee table
drinking expensive wine

INT THE BACK SEAT OF A CAB —- NIGHT

Eddie and Lindy dressed to the nines are clearly returning
from a fancy party and passionately entwined at the point

of having hot sex driver or no driver

EDDIE (V0)
Every place

INT EDDIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lindy is in bed Eddie stands naked at the window looking
out

LINDY
What are you doing hon

EDDIE
Nothing

LINDY
Why do you keep looking out there

He walks back over to her looks down She is snuggled up in
Eddie’s pillow looking very pretty and vulnerable

LINDY
What you think somebody’s stalking
you

EDDIE
No

EDDIE (V0)
It was only half a lie I wasn’t
sure

LINDY
Is there anything you want to tell
me Eddie Now’s the time

He looks back at her eyes unreadable He shrugs

EDDIE
With success comes enemies

LINDY
Old Chinese proverb

EDDIE
No proverb An inevitability

LINDY
You should sleep Isn’t your Van
Loon meeting tomorrow

Eddie nods sighs turns away from the window Then stops
He turns pale Is sweating

LINDY
What What

Eddie takes a step And suddenly
He’s across the room
Boom A skip in time

EDDIE (V0)

Then I found myself at the door
With no consciousness that I had
moved

He puts his hand on a table steadies himself

He catches a look in the mirror of this lean handsome
dapper shark he has become

EDDIE (V0)
It was only then that I realized I
hadn’t eaten in three days

LINDY
Are you all right

EDDIE
I will be

He hopes

INT THE ORPHEUS ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie sits at a table discreetly wolfing a few appetizers
Kevin Doyle arrives looking a little nervous

KEVIN
Hey

He sits launches in

KEVIN
Hell be here in ten Now look
since we have a minute be warned
Van Loon’s mercurial One minute
your best friend the nextyou’re a
leper And he needs direct
answers anything tentative and
you’ve lost him forever I think we
should rehearse a few scenarios

EDDIE
I’m eating Kevin

There is so much quiet authority in Eddie’s tone that Kevin
just shuts up But a moment later looking at the sweat on
Eddie’s brow Kevin is pecking at him again
KEVIN
You up for this You sure Because
I’ve got a little bit on the line
here--

EDDIE
Have a toast point

Brazening it out again Because Eddie isn’t sure he can pull
this off either

ACROSS THE ROOM - LATER

There is that little stir from the hostess and staff that can
only mean the entrance of a very rich and powerful man

The BARTENDER eyes the flurry instantly stops what he’s
doing and starts mixing another drink

EDDIES TABLE - LATER

The martini is put down on the table We tilt up to CARL VAN
LOON a young 50 no less vital and intense than the
hungriest 27-year-old shark on the make But he affects
geniality He sits the middle-aged man with him PIERCE
does the same

VAN LOON
So Eddie Spinola

He looks Eddie directly in the eyes

VAN LOON
What’s your secret

A beat Eddie looks at him back directly in the eyes
EDDIE
Medication I’m on special
medication
Another beat And Van Loon laughs Pierce doesn’t

ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER - THAT NIGHT

Eddie is in mid-spiel Van Loon listening intently
EDDIE
--Yes that’s partially what I’m
saying--

PIERCE

(contemptuous ly)
Pattern recognition So that’s your
snake-oil Look if there’s one
thing we all understand it’s
understanding itself -- that’s how
the business works

(scoffing)
Pattern recognition Please

EDDIE
(pointedly)
Of course not everyone can
understand the patterns

Kevin sucks in his breath Pierce is annoyed Van Loon
mildly amused but not necessarily impressed Eddie
continues with his unstoppable MDT-fueled insights

EDDIE
Look there’s no time for human
judgement anymore You see a chance
you blink and it’s gone We are
entering the age of decentralized
online decision-making with the
decisions being made by hundreds of
millions of individual investors
around the world people making a
killing in less time than it takes to
sneeze but without consulting each
other So it’s not understanding how
companies work It’s understanding
how mass psychology works

PIERCE
(scoffing)
And you have a formula

KEVIN
(mediating)
Well from 12 thousand to one point
two million in six days--

EDDIE
Yes I do have a formula Mr
Pierce

PIERCE
(snorting)
Delusions of grandeur

EDDIE
I don’t have delusions of grandeur

A beat as we PUSH IN on Eddie’s face

EDDIE
I have an actual recipe for grandeur

Kevin stares in horror Van Loon still says nothing

EXT THE ORPHEUS ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie simply stands there coolly Kevin is nervously saying
goodbye to Van Loon and Pierce making small talk

KEVIN
-and oh you know she’s on the
wait list Rosemary’s pretty
devastated

VAN LOON

My daughter went there I’11 call
the school for you

Kevin blubbers with gratitude Van Loon’s car pulls up
Kevin pumps his hand Van Loon looks past Kevin -- to Eddie

VAN LOON
Eddie Ride

It’s the first real acknowledgement that he’s taken Eddie
seriously

INT VAN LOON’S LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

Eddie and Van Loon regard each other Finally Van Loon
speaks

VAN LOON
I don’t know who you are Eddie or
what your game is but I’m sure of
one thing you don’t work in this
business I’m up to my ass in
business graduates and you don’t
have their half-cocky half-terrified
line of bullshit Which is not to
say I like yours any better
He picks up a file hands it to Eddie

VAN LOON
But you obviously pick your stocks in
a way I haven’t seen So tell me
We’re thinking of acquiring these
companies Take a few minutes
What’s your take on them

EXT EDDIE’S APARTMENT BUILDING —- NIGHT

Van Loon’s limo pulls up

INT VAN LOON’S LIMO - NIGHT

Eddie snaps the file shut hands Van Loon back his pen
flashlight

EDDIE
But these companies aren’t the
question are they

VAN LOON
What do you mean

EDDIE
Well -- your company has no use for a
Broadband outfit -- unless it’s a

component for part of a larger whole
that encompasses media so there’s a
missing puzzle piece

Van Loon’s gaze is expressionless

EDDIE
--another half of a global entity
which a company like this would
benefit
(beat whistles)
This must be some massive merger
youre contemplating

A flicker in Van Loon’s eyes Bullseye

EDDIE
And there’s really only one entity
large enough to justify a merger with
Van Loon Associates and not merely
be another one of your
acquisitions

VAN LOON
Have you been talking to somebody-

EDDIE
Carl it’s just rationalization

He says it like it’s the simplest thing in the world
to a person on MDT it is Van Loon grinds his teeth
Wanting to talk about it but too skittish

EDDIE
Is Hank Atwood going to go for it

A long beat

VAN LOON
You are either an amazing con artist
or a very smart man

EDDIE
Is he

A beat as the two men stare at each other

VAN LOON
You realize that if the press got one
whisper of -- I can’t fucking believe
I’m even discussing this --

EDDIE
It doesn’t matter It won’t come
off

Now Van Loon chuckles amused by Eddie’s audacity

VAN LOON
The word “brazen” does not even begin
to go there

EDDIE
But it could come off If you back
off Mexico

VAN LOON
What do you mean

Eddie suddenly pulls back the bait

EDDIE
I don’t think you’d want to hear
about it from some shmuck who needs a
ride home

Which
VAN LOON
Youre a gusty little prick Eddie

EDDIE
Ooh Now you’re curious

VAN LOON
Yeah I must admit You’ve hit a
couple pretty big buttons Go on
Tell me what you think

EDDIE
(dismissive)
It’s getting late

Van Loon laughs

VAN LOON
All right You get your shot Come
to my office tomorrow at ten and
tell me just exactly how the schmuck
who needs the ride would re-structure
this deal

Eddie nods

VAN LOON
And you better be prepared

EDDIE
I’m at your disposal

Eddie opens the car door Van Loon eyes his building
scoffs

VAN LOON
You don’t really live here

Eddie smiles
EDDIE

The Spartans weren’t big on
amenities

VAN LOON
Yes And they eventually got their
asses kicked

He gets out Van Loon drives off

EXT EDDIE’S BLOCK - NIGHT

EDDIE (V0)
I didn’t go in

Eddie keeps walking by his building

EDDIE (V0)
I wanted to walk move digest
ingest

His stride picks up buoyantly

EDDIE (V0)
There are moments in life moments
when you know you’ve crossed a
bridge You’re over the moat your
old life is over Van Loon was my
bridge One week two weeks from
now I would be eating in restaurants
with ambassadors cardinals
CEO’s network anchormen I would
be flying to Japan for meetings
vacationing in Medici villas
Sitting in my soon-to-be ex-apartment
was not an option

He steps off the curb

EDDIE (V0)
Suddenly

A SHARP JARRING
CUT TO
EXT HOUSTON STREET - NIGHT
Eddie is stepping off another curb God knows where

EDDIE (V0)
There was another skip

He stops rocked
EDDIE (V0)
How had I gone that last 20 blocks
I didn’t know I got another ten

ON EDDIE WALKING

EDDIE (V0)
-- then

in mid-step

EXT UPPER 5TH AVENUE - NIGHT
Eddie is walking past the Metropolitan Museum
EDDIE (V0)
I was back uptown What had happened

in the interim

A SHARP JARRING
CUT TO

INT A CLUB - NIGHT

Eddie is suddenly sitting at a bar picking up a drink
people around him

EDDIE (V0)
What bar was this Was it Harlem

A SHARP JARRING
CUT TO

Eddie is dancing with a BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN
EDDIE (V0)
Same bar Different bar How long
had passed
He breaks away from her starts for the door
A SHARP JARRING
CUT TO
INT A CLUB LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie comes to in the act of banging THE BEAUTIFUL BLACK
WOMAN savagely against the stall door

EDDIE (V0)
And it happened again--

A SHARP JARRING
CUT TO

EXT HARLEM STREET IN FRONT OF BAR

Bam A LARGE BLACK MAN crumples in front of Eddie -- goes
down hit blood pouring from his nose (Could he be the
boyfriend of the girl Eddie’s just banged) Eddie stares at
his bloody fist It hurts--

EDDIE (V0)
And again

INT A LOFT - NIGHT

EDDIE (V0)
And again

Eddie sits on a plush sofa with several MIDDLE-AGED
INTERNATIONAL TYPES some chattering in Italian He has a

drink in his hand There are paintbrushes paints and
canvasses strewn around a livework space

EDDIE (V0)
And again

A SHARP JARRING
CUT TO

(And now the images are speeding up)

INT A HOTEL CORRIDOR —- NIGHT

Eddie is walking down the plush corridor with an ATTRACTIVE
MIDDLE-AGED LATIN WOMAN we saw at the artist’s loft

Now it’s just FLASHES -- skimming stones of consciousness--
A WINE CORK being popped A PLATE OF MUSSELS swimming in
wine sauce Rumpled SHEETS And thenA BLUR OF MOTION --
bodies a swirl of riotous color -- A FRENZY OF SHOTS A CAB
STOPPING A GARGOYLE ON A BUILDING A DOG LEASH ABANDONED
IN A PUDDLE

No rhyme no reason just image image image

And then blackness

EXT THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE —- DAWN

Eddie is walking now with a limp

EDDIE (V0)
When it finally stopped I was on the
Brooklyn Bridge Would I ever know
why

He stops Looks back The familiar postcard view of
Manhattan is ahead of him looking like it always looks

EDDIE (V0)
I only knew that I couldn’t account
for the last eight hours of my life
I had a limp

His foot hurts when he puts it down

EDDIE (V0)
There was nothing to do but walk
home

He turns around and limps back towards the island

INT EDDIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Eddie is sleeping in all his clothes

EDDIE (V0)
It was my first sleep in two days

INT EDDIE’S LIVING ROOM —- DAY

Eddie looking very groggy is holding a THICK PACKET marked
“Van Loon Associates - BY COURIER” The files Carl Van Loon
sent Sitting on the dining table is an MDT tablets He
stares at them

EDDIE (V0)
Should I take it Would I start
“skipping time” again

He doesn’t take it

ANOTHER ANGLE - TIME CUT

Eddie is sitting in his reading chair exhausted going
through the paperwork

EDDIE (V0)
Even off MDT I decided to give Van
Loon’s files a shot

VAN LOON’S FILES - CLOSE

Eddie leafs through them pieces of paper charting
corporate growth covered with charts graphs and mind-
numbing statistics PUSH IN ON Eddie’s face as he
realizes

EDDIE (V0)
They were incomprehensible
INT A WALL STREET OFFICE - DAY
The phone rings Kevin Doyle picks it up
KEVIN
Hello-- Eddie-- What are you
talking about
And we CROSS-CUT between them
EDDIE
I can’t make the meeting I’m uh

I’m sick

It’s a lame excuse it sounds lame as he says it but then
he’s off MDT

KEVIN
Yeah well you can’t have some
fucking flu right now -- he’1ll never

give you this chance again

EDDIE
I need to ah analyze the data--

We see the two men continue to talk Kevin growing more
agitated Eddie growing more sheepish as we HEAR

EDDIE (0S)

Already I recognized it the thick
tongue the uncooperative synapses
frozen at the simplest question It
was regular Eddie the Eddie of the
Dark Ages an Eddie that I couldn’t
imagine having been for all those
years and an Eddie that was nearly
unbearable to be now

We FADE UP THE SOUND on the two men

KEVIN
-- Don’t you get it This is your
test--

EDDIE
Well I can’t pass a fucking test
right now

KEVIN
And how am I going to look if you
dont

Eddie looks pretty bad He massages his temples

EDDIE
Okay Kevin Okay

He hands up on a still-yammering Doyle He picks up the MDT
pill looks at it

EDDIE (V0)
It was my first morning off MDT ina
month The beginnings of a headache
began to curl around my head like a
fat greasy python

Again he looks at the MDT tablet weighing his options

EDDIE (V0)
But the time-skips had me scared

He puts the tablet back down on the table

INT THE REGENCY HOTEL RESTAURANT —- DAY

Eddie walks in much more tentative in his stride fear in
his eyes

EDDIE (VO)
Kevin had made it clear -- I’d just
have to brazen it out

This is the real Eddie the non-MDT Eddie and he feels
suddenly out of place with the curly maple paneling antique
Persian carpets

INT BAR AREA - DAY

Eddie sits on a couch Pierce on another chair Van Loon
opposite watching him

EDDIE (VO)

My thought -- such as I had one --
was to tap dance with Van Loon until
I could find out more about MDT

VAN LOON

What do you know about Hank Atwood
EDDIE

Uh iconoclast owns um a ball

team

He’s struggling

VAN LOON

Uh-huh So this is “prepared”

Eddie

He shoots Eddie a look of withering contempt Eddie holds
the stare and shoots a look back

EDDIE
What is this Atwood 101 Everyone
knows about Atwood

VAN LOON
Where was he two years ago

A flicker in Eddie’s eyes What’s the right answer

EDDIE
Nowhere

An agonizing pause Then Van Loon nods

VAN LOON
Two years ago Forbes didn’t even have
him on the radar

EDDIE
Yeah his Great Leap Forward

Eddie is faking it Pierce is looking at him intently But
Eddie’s staying afloat

VAN LOON
The guy comes on out of nowhere so
fucking strong he has me on the run
Beat me out of two properties
invests in bumfuck countries the
commies just got out of places I
wouldn’t go near sextuples his
money

Eddie’s glance flicks to the TV behind the bar A WOMAN’S
PICTURE flashes on the TV screen -- and he recognizes it
It’s the Italian woman he has memory flashes of having met
last night

VAN LOON
-Always picks the right
technologies invests in them and a
year later he owns them

Eddie strains to hear the ANCHORWOMAN’S VOICE

ANCHORWOMAN
- found dead in her hotel room last
night victim of foul play

Eddie tries to keep his face immobile Van Loon’s voice
drones on distorted now as we HEAR Eddie’s heart pounding

VAN LOON
--100 billion if he has a nickel
and I have to convince him somehow
that I can raise his game

ANCHORWOMAN
An unidentified eyewitness has
reported seeing a man with a limp
leaving the scene Anyone with
information should contact local law
enforcement authorities --Steve
Eddie bolts upright
VAN LOON
So what is all this about fucking
Mexico
Eddie is pale sweaty faint There’s only one thing to do

EDDIE
Excuse me

Eddie dashes out Van Loon and Pierce look at each other

EXT THE REGENCY - NIGHT

He leans against a street sign trying to right himself He
gasps for breath

EDDIE (V0)

-«or could I

INT EDDIE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Eddie comes in breathing wildly panicked

EDDIE (VO)

If I could walk talk conduct

without really remembering could I
kill someone Was it even me Who

Immediately the PHONE RINGS He nearly jumps out of his
skin He can’t answer He sits on the couch head in his

hands rocking as he counts the rings
Finally the machine picks up

MELISSA’S VOICE
Hi Eddie it’s Melissa

Eddie freezes

MELISSA’S VOICE
Look um Vern wasn’t giving you
anything was he Because that
stuff -- that MDT-whatever -- it’s
really really dangerous-- I mean

Eddie picks up the phone

EDDIE

MELISSA

CLOSE ON - EDDIE’S DRESSER DRAWER - DAY

other people who might know about

MDT

His hands find what they’re looking for Vernon’s LITTLE
BLACK BOOK

EDDIE (V0)
Vernon’s other clients

INT EDDIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

Eddie sits on the bed the little black book open on his
knees Eddie looks at the page then reaches for the
telephone Picks it up Hears STRANGE CLICKS over the dial
tone Puts down the phone fear on his face

EDDIE (V0)
It was probably paranoia But I
didn’t like it
EXT DOWNTOWN STREET —- DAY
Eddie walks slipping through the crowd trying to suppress
his limp he looks nervously behind him is that MAN in

the TAN RAINCOAT following him

He tries to walk faster but it makes his limp more
pronounced

He turns the corner He seems to have lost the guy

weeks ago Then uh last
Wednesday he collapsed at work

SMASH CUT TO

Eddie turns to the last page of Vernon’s book
EDDIE (VO)
It was the same story every time Of
the people I called three were dead
and the remainder were sick
Eddie dials the last number
Instantly there is a RING

We RACK FOCUS TO--

The MAN in the TAN COAT sitting a discreet distance from

Eddie His phone is ringing
Eddie turns white
The man takes out his cell phone and answers

MAN’S VOICE
Hello Hello

The man suddenly looks up
Locks eyes with Eddie Knows that he knows
Eddie leaps up begins to run

The man leaps up and follows

EXT DOWNTOWN STREET —- DAY
Eddie runs as fast as desperately as he can

EDDIE (V0)
Off MDT my body was in molasses

He still has the limp from his blackout escapade too
can’t run fast

Tan Coat is gaining

He

Eddie collides with pedestrians steps on street sunglass
displays sends a saxophonist sprawling
Tan Coat is gaining

EDDIE (V0)
In the end my stupidity saved me

Eddie panicked not looking runs for the crosswalk
EDDIE (V0)

No New Yorker with his faculties

intact steps off the curb against the

light
EDDIE’S POV - A HUGE TRUCK
is barrelling unstoppably right towards him--
EDDIE
is frozen The TRUCK SWERVES up on the curb Tan Coat must
dive out of the way knocking down pedestrians like bowling
pins as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT mangling it -- then is
WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it

When Tan Coat extracts himself from the pile of prone
pedestrians his last glimpse is of--

EDDIE - DOWN THE BLOCK

disappearing down into a Subway entrance Swallowed by a
crowd

TAN COAT
hesitates but knows that he can’t catch up Eddie’s given
him the slip This time
INT CHARLIE’S COFFEE SHOP —- DAY
Eddie limping enters looking around anxiously
EDDIE (V0)

What was I dealing with Who could

tell me I hoped against hope

that Melissa would show

EDDIE’S POV —- SCANNING THE PLACE

Not one person in it could possibly be Melissa

EDDIE (V0)
But she didn’t

Eddie turns to go

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Eddie

Eddie turns back There sitting at a booth is a rather
thick-waisted short-haired brunette middle-aged woman
wearing a large shapeless sweater

Eddie had looked right at her and not recognized her She
bears no relationship to the siren Melissa of his memories

Eddie tries to hide the shock on his face

EDDIE
Melissa

He goes to her sits Yes it’s the same person but
dramatically tragically changed Her face is puffy her
pallor blotchy There are lines under her eyes and around
her mouth lines brought on by more than the passage of a few
years

Eddie tries to conceal his shock

EDDIE
You how are you doing

Melissa responds with a cynical shrug Then she eyes him

MELISSA
Don’t tell me I look good because I
know I don’t I didn’t want you to
see me this way
(beat)
You look good

EDDIE
I uh I lost some weight

MELISSA
Yeah well MDT’11 do that to you

They regard each other for minute unsure of where to start
Old emotions New emotions Shock Dismay Affection

MELISSA
I know you’ve been doing it I just
read the Post Eddie

(MORE)
Short-sel1 Meg 1SSdciaemt Sépond-

guessing the markets You Come on
Eddie doesn’t know what to say

EDDIE
Since when do you read the Post

MELISSA
These days the Post’s about all I
can read

EDDIE
Melissa what do you know about all
this

Melissa looks him right in the eyes

MELISSA
MDT is lethal Or can be I know
what I’m talking about And I only
took nine or ten hits

EDDIE
When was this

MELISSA
Vernon didn’t tell you any of this
did he

EDDIE
No

Melissa snorts as if to say typical

MELISSA
Well when he told me about this
amazing new drug I was like down

the hatch And it was amazing I
read Brian Greene’s The Elegant
Universe in 45 minutes and understood
it My work rate increased tenfold
overnight My boss started to hate
me -- they offered me his job And
then I got scared

EDDIE
Why

MELISSA
I’m not stupid I knew no one could
maintain that level of mental
activity for very long and survive
I stopped taking it
EDDIE
And

MELISSA

I started getting sick Headaches
nausea I went back to Vernon to see
if I maybe shouldn’t take another
hit or half a hit and then he told
me about about the people who were
dying One guy didn’t die but he’s
a vegetable his mother has to sponge
him down every day

(beat)
How much have you been taking Eddie

A long beat as they look into each other’s eyes

EDDIE
A lot

MELISSA
Well maybe they’ve worked out the
bugs Maybe maybe this isn’t the

same batch

Eddie hates the look in her eyes His hands are at
temples

MELISSA

You’re off it right now aren’t you
EDDIE

Yeah
MELISSA

Are you getting a headache

EDDIE
Finish your story

MELISSA
Well I didn’t take more And I
didn’t die But after a while I found
I couldn’t concentrate on anything
for longer than ten minutes I
missed deadlines I got lazy and
sluggish put on weight my
memory was shot to bits The
magazine let me go The marriage
fell apart Sex Get out of here

She leans back looks him in the eyes

his

MELISSA
That was four years ago and I
haven’t been the same since I can’t
read any more -- I mean the fucking
New York Post

Eddie feels ill physically ill hearing this

MELISSA
I also can’t deal with stressful or
emotional situations I’m wired up
now from seeing you but after this
Im going to have a migraine for
three days And I’ve got to pee
Which is another thing

She gets up goes into the Ladies Room Eddie watches
after her We HOLD on Eddie’s face

EDDIE (V0)
How many times had I thought of her
over the years the beautiful
shining Melissa of my youth

We see FLASHES OF YOUNG MELISSA

EDDIE (V0)
But that Melissa had unraveled in
time and space and was a ghost now
I was never going to see her again
never bump into her in the street

The tears gather behind Eddie’s eyes He can’t help it He
puts his hand to his face to hide his emotions
EXT COFFEE SHOP —- DAY

Eddie leaves with Melissa He is controlling his tears --
barely

MELISSA
You have some left Good Go home
and take it Take the dose down but

don’t just stop -- that’s what I did
Maybe you can taper off

Otherwise the headache’s just the
beginning I have to go--

Eddie indeed is rubbing his temples

EDDIE
But when I run out--

MELISSA
I don’t know I have to go--

Eddie catches her arm

EDDIE
Who invented MDT

MELISSA
I don’t know--

EDDIE
Do the police know Did the police
say they found any link between
Vernon’s murder and--

MELISSA
No They just assumed it was a coke
thing

EDDIE

Like our marriage
She sees the look on Eddie’s face

MELISSA
I didn’t mean it Eddie

Eddie looks into her eyes

EDDIE
It wasn’t a coke thing

MELISSA
No

A wisp of a smile between them There had been something
between them after all

But there’s nothing now

MELISSA
Goodbye

Eddie lets go of her arm A middle-aged puffy woman about
to cry She turns her back and moves away from him stiffly
without looking back

EXT EDDIE’S POV - HIS APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Eddie stands in a doorway looking at his building

EDDIE (VO)
I was getting sicker by the minute
Did I dare go in and get my pill

He looks around No one seems to be there Suddenly --
WHAM He’s pushed up against the wall of his building
Not by Tan Coat

By GENNADY THE RUSSIAN

GENNADY
You fucking forget about me Huh

Eddie is stunned -- Gennady whacked his head against the
building pretty hard He still clutches the MDT tablet tight
in his fist

can’t take a check

EDDIE
Gennady look--

GENNADY

EDDIE
I wasn’t thinking Look we just

need to go to my bank--

OOF Gennady has punched him in the stomach Harder than
he’s ever been punched

While Eddie is reeling staggering from this Gennady’s eye
falls on the LITTLE WHITE PILL on the table

GENNADY
What’s that

Eddie is gasping for breath

EDDIE
Aspirin

Eddie tries to reach for it Gennady catches his arm
GENNADY
Don’t look like no aspirin I ever
see

His voice drips with crude contempt

GENNADY
What is it Something good eh

In one swift motion Gennady grabs the pill puts it in his
mouth and swallows it

Eddie is mute with shock

INT A BANK - CLOSE ON

Eddie’s shaking hands are handing Gennady a thick envelope

He wants to hit Eddie again but thinks the better of it with
all the bank cameras

We see Gennady give the camera a gay little wave then turn
and walk out

Yes --Eddie there’s someone
following me

they’re making every turn I’m making

EDDIE
Don’t get out

EXT FIFTH AVENUE - DAY

Lindy bolts from the cab just as TAN COAT puts his hand on
the opposite door

She takes off into Central Park

And he’s after her like a shot

EXT CENTRAL PARK — DAY

Lindy veers off the path through the trees zig-zagging
trying to find a place not to be seen

TAN COAT
Zig-zags too not far behind her
LINDY

Comes to a section of huge decorative BOULDERS and ROCKS
Dives behind one of them

Ahead she can see the outdoor ICE SKATERS couples
families enjoying the ice It seems surreal

Several yards behind her is TAN COAT looking behind every
tree every trash bin

Lindy picks up the phone keeping her voice low although
she’s hyperventilating

LINDY
Eddie I’m hiding but I’m stuck
He’s going to find me

And we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN

INT LINDY’S OFFICE —- DAY

Yes --Oh God He’s so close

EDDIE

--Lindy Are you there LINDY--

A beat We PUSH IN on Lindy’s eyes Which are changing
Growing more steely Determined

LINDY
Eddie I feel it

She hangs up Eddie is left looking at the phone

EXT CENTRAL PARK — DAY

Tan Coat is perhaps five yards behind Lindy and getting
closer But she’s not crying any more She’s looking at--

THE ICE SKATING RINK

and the skaters whirling across the ice
LINDY’S

eyes flash She knows what to do

Suddenly she BOLTS from her hiding place behind the rock
tearing down the hill as fast as she can

Tan Coat is behind her like a shot

EXT THE ICE SKATING RINK - DAY

Lindy races down the hill pushing past the line of people
and onto the ice

Tan Coat is clearly desperate -- he doesn’t give a shit who
sees him chasing her In a flash he’s on the ice after
Lindy running and sliding People collide with him he
pushes skaters aside sending them sprawling

Just as he’s closing in on Lindy
Lindy wheels around grabs a SIX YEAR OLD GIRL under the
arms and HOISTS HER INTO THE AIR swinging her legs at Tan

Coat as hard as she can

The little girl’s skates arc through the air -- whoosh --
and connect CUTTING Tan Coat’s FACE

Badly
He sinks to his knees hand to his cheek welling blood
People scream and scatter

Lindy keeps her wits about her She runs sliding across the
ice and leaping the fence with surprising grace

She’s gone

INT LINDY’S OFFICE - DAY - ON EDDIE’S HAND - CLOSE

She looks him right in the eyes Drops his hands

EDDIE

She gets up turns away from him

LINDY
I understand that stuff now Eddie
And I don’t blame you for taking it
I could never have imagined no
matter what anyone told me what it
can do It’s invincibility isn’t
it And I know that I will think
about wanting to take it again every
day for the rest of my life

There’s a matter-of-fact chill in her voice that Eddie hasn’t
heard before
LINDY

I just came up to say goodbye I

don’t ever want to see you again

I’m not even going to stay in New

York I’m going back to Chicago

Don’t try to find me and don’t try

to help me

She’s done with him

Gennady quickly gets aggressive

GENNADY
You think you can run out on me You

Something is jammed into Eddie’s ribs Something under
Gennady’s coat Eddie doesn’t blink

is sitting pretends to order another drink He does not
make eye contact with the detective or look like he’s
talking to him

EDDIE

I would be in a witness lineup as a
possible murderer

Eddie is making a presentation to the Van Loon Associates --
and a skeptical-looking OLDER GUY -- HANK ATWOOD

EDDIE
well a unified front between Van
Loon and Atwood would be lethally
effective and not a moment too
soon SyCorps Andine and others are
jockeying for the same industrial
concessions in Mexico that both our
companies are secretly sniffing
out

HANK ATWOOD
How do you know this

EDDIE
Well the governmental bribe
structure is in itself corrupt so
of course information about its inner
workings like anything can be
bought And there are other
barbarians waving cash at the gates
I have a list here in descending
order of threat

Atwood rubs his temples seemingly distracted But then he
looks at Eddie piercingly

ATWOOD
Go on

INT VAN LOON’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

The meeting has broken up Atwood is leaving surrounded by
minions Van Loon leans into Eddie

VAN LOON
Eddie What’s your read

VAN LOON

EDDIE
Might be an act

VAN LOON
Yeah doesn’t track He’s not even

Atwood’s gone Van Loon looks at Eddie

VAN LOON
So Eddie What are you going to do

question

EDDIE

What question is that Carl

VAN LOON
If all this comes off what your
take is going to be

Eddie smiles at him cool and composed

EDDIE
I guess I’m in your hands

VAN LOON
Well given the scale of your
contribution Eddie it won’t be
anything less than forty I don’t
know say forty-five

Eddie shoots him a look
EDDIE (VO)
I was new at this but forty-five
thousand seemed a little light
Van Loon reads the look and laughs

guys eye Eddie’s security guys and vice versa Gennady is
wearing a suit and looks much more sophisticated

Eddie hands Gennady a small envelope Gennady takes it In
his eyes is a penetrating intelligence

EDDIE (V0)
Right away it was obvious he was on
MDA

Gennady whips out a silver lighter and lights himself a
cigarette His movements are elegant refined

GENNADY
Next week I require twenty
pills

EDDIE
Next week You can fuck yourself
(beat)
Not that you’1ll feel anything

Gennady’s eyebrow goes up Gennady’s security guys reach
into their jackets So do Eddie’s guys Gennady’s eyes
flick over the situation motion to his guys to keep stil

Gennady laughs an unpleasant sound

GENNADY
I don’t think your Forbes 400 new
financial friends would appreciate
the details of your little dilemma
with the police

Gennady turns with a flourish and walks off Over his
shoulder with smug confidence

GENNADY
Thursday You have them here

EDDIE (V0)
Fucking MDT Made the blind see the
lame walk and could give a crude
simian lower life form a brain

Gennady turns walks to the curb where a NEW BLACK TOWN
is waiting for him and his boys

Obviously this could not go on
But there is very little on this
earth that 45 million dollars can’t
solve And tomorrow at nine Atwood
would sign the papers

Van Loon and Eddie can’t imagine what’s coming next

MRS ATWOOD
My husband experienced some pain and
dizziness this morning He’s at

intention of signing the contract

proceed

PUSH IN on Eddie’s eyes

EDDIE (V0)
One thought did come
(beat)
Was there anywhere

We begin to REWIND in Eddie’s mind through many IMAGES
weve seen in this movie stopping briefly at all the
places Eddie has stashed his MDT

EDDIE (V0)
- anywhere at allI could have
left one pill

We STOP at the END TABLE in Lindy’s apartment peer inside

statement

MRS HANK ATWOOD
There is absolutely no truth to the
rumor of this merger None
whatsoever My husband is having
some tests this is a difficult time
and I would appreciate your directing
further questions to our attorney

She motions at the gentleman next to her
--Who is also Eddie’s attorney MORRIS BRANDT

The one who was so helpful with the police The one who held
his jacket

Bitter amusement in Eddie’s eyes At least he knows

The APARTMENT BUZZER buzzes Eddie freezes Looks at the
door It BUZZES again

EDDIE (V0)
It wasn’t downstairs security
alerting me to a visitor It was my
inner door Someone was in the
building ten feet away right now

Eddie walks to his phone picks it up Pushes the button
puts it to his ear

It’s dead
He pushes the “on” button again and again Nothing
The buzzer BUZZES again

Eddie rushes to the door opens the COAT CLOSET In the
closet is a state-of-the-art SECURITY MONITOR

Gennady and TWO MEN are outside his door

Suddenly the MONITOR goes BLACK

Eddie flicks the switch on the monitor Nothing Eddie
flicks the switch again It’s dead Someone somewhere has
figured out how to disarm it

The buzzer BUZZES again Eddie backs away from the door We

HEAR Eddie’s shallow panicked breathing He lunges for his
briefcase pulls out his CELL PHONE

THE CELL PHONE - CLOSE
It reads “No Signal”

EDDIE (V0)
I knew damn well there was a signal
But an MDT-stoked brain could figure
out how to do anything

The door holds but Eddie begins to back away in horror

And now we pick up Eddie where we left him standing on the
ledge He drains the last of the scotch in his hand -- the
“last drink” he spoke of earlier

EDDIE (V0)
Of course they would kill me slowly
and horribly But this choice would
at least be mine

We now hear the 22222222 of some major power tool drilling
at the door punctuated by more BAMS -- one way or another
they’re going to get in

Eddie takes a breath tries to jump He can’t
EDDIE (V0)

But we are instinctive creatures We
want to live So my foggy brain

continued to try to remember where

one tablet of MDT might have been

left
We PUSH IN on Eddie’s eyes We are still REWINDING in
Eddie’s mind images of where we’ve seen him keep MDT
nothing nothing nothing We STOP at the SUGARBOWL on
Eddie’s dining table Then go forward -- no wait--

rewinding stopping again on the SUGAR BOWL Pushing in on
the sugar bowl

Eddie spins around looks back into his apartment eyes
intense
EDDIE (VO)
It was possible And possible was
enough

INT THE CELESTIAL - EDDIE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie is tearing through boxes as the POUNDING and DRILLING

become deafening he rips open a box labeled “Kitchen” -
it’s full of BOOKS Mis-labeled

JUMP CUTS as he rips open other boxes his hands
frantically scattering CDs cutlery cans of food

The door begins to give

Under the deafening DRILL MORE JUMP-CUTS as Eddie
hysterically tears the packing paper off of promisingly-
shaped objects --No A glass --No A vase --YES
The sugar bowl

With sugar still inside

Eddie rummages frantically among the sugar cubes as the
door gives a few inches groaning and we glimpse blurred
faces on the other side

EDDIE’S HAND

pokes wildly among the cubes pushing them aside
revealing at the bottom of the bowl--

ONE MDT TABLET

looks back up at him Yes It’s really there
Eddie grabs it just as with a splintering CRASH --
The door goes down

Eddie steps back brings the pill up to his mouth

But as he steps he TRIPS on a SOUP CAN he’s scattered
FALLS backwards his HAND hits the side of the coffee
table

The MDT TABLET goes flying (Slow motion) as

-also in slow motion Gennady and his two thugs smile as
they advance into the room

he

THE MDT TABLET flies flies towards a GRATE in the
floor -- a heating vent -- and HITS it rolling

- before disappearing forever down the grate

Eddie knows that’s it His life has ended He sucks in his
last breath -- then with a YELL he rushes back for the
terrace for his suicide leap

Thug 1 is quicker Gets to the door first Eddie will not
have the luck to be able to jump He’s trapped between
Gennady and the first thug

Thug 2 disappears down the hall We HEAR him starting to
tear things up Gennady remains smiling at Eddie perfectly
calm

GENNADY
Where do you keep it

Eddie is now backed to the wall Nowhere to go

EDDIE
I’m plum out

Gennady just smiles -- that was an unfortunate choice -- and
clicks open a BLACK ATTACHE CASE It is filled with sinister-
looking silver instruments and knives

INT EDDIE’S STUDY - NIGHT

Thug 2 has found behind a bureau a SAFE He calls
excitedly in Russian to the other room

INT EDDIE’S LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

Gennady stops looks up and then gives an order again in
Russian to Thug 1 who grabs the tools (with which they
disabled the door) and disappears into the study

Gennady and Eddie are alone Gennady picks up a particularly
delicate yet sharp-looking KNIFE

GENNADY
This is a waste of my time you know
that I am getting out of this part
of the business starting import-
export company Very exciting stuff
A lot on my plate I need to learn
to delegate

Eddie is backed up against a table which is covered with
stuff he’s scattered which includes a BUTCHER BLOCK with A
KNIFE in it

Gennady starts arranging his instruments

GENNADY
First I will cut skin from you flay
you you stay alive nice long
time then maybe we cut meat from
you steaks or maybe softer
parts I get inspiration

He looks up smiles to see the effect his words have on
Eddie

ON EDDIE

Staring back at Gennady hard a fuck-you stare We can’t
see behind Eddie’s back but we can see the butcher block
and the knife is gone

GENNADY
senses something is not right Looks at Eddie quizzically

GENNADY
What--

Eddie brings the knife up as hard as he can right into
Gennady’s stomach

Gennady gasps in surprise chokes writhes Eddie drives the
knife home harder grabbing Gennady’s other hand which
lashes at Eddie with the fillet knife

The men fall to the floor in a death-struggle Eddie
exhausted off MDT but determined not to let go

Gennady writhes flails but doesn’t cry out he’s already
choking on blood Eyes shocked surprised Eddie turns the
fillet knife back on Gennady slashes at his other arm
blood spurts

But it’s not necessary Gennady’s eyes are glazing His
gurgling gets quieter He’s quite dead

Eddie lies alongside him panting arm grazed and welling
blood from where Gennady’s filleting knife slashed him
suddenly weak and exhausted From the other room comes the
BRRRRRRR sound of the drill -- the boys oblivious are hard
at work on the safe Eddie tries to get up then falls back
EDDIE (V0)
I couldn’t move That last bit of
energy had wrecked my MDT-depleted

body I was going into the pit

fast
Eddie tries to get up but starts to get the shakes no
more of a convulsion he sinks back to the floor

EDDIE (V0)
I could not get up I would die
here too
There is a break in the convulsion Then another one starts
EDDIE (V0)
Only MDT could help me and the last
of it was in this creatures
bloodstream
Gennady’s BLOOD wells around Gennady’s body in a crimson
puddle A puddle that’s creeping closer and closer to
Eddie’s face which is lying convulsing on the floor
ON EDDIE’S EYES
between convulsions suddenly looking Looking at the blood
It creeps closer to Eddie’s face Eddie is trying to move
trying to push his face closer to the blood he’s there
And now he turns his face down into the blood

And begins to lap it up

INT EDDIE’S STUDY - DAY

The Thug finally gets the safe open Inside is only one item
-- the TATTOOD SECURITY MAN’s SEVERED HAND And its middle
finger has been arranged in a vehement fuck-you

The thugs are not amused

INT EDDIE’S APARTMENT —- HALLWAY - NIGHT

The thugs are coming down the hall muttering angrily

INT EDDIE’S LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

Mouth smeared with blood Eddie is dragging himself by the
elbows across the room Footsteps coming Fast

INT EDDIE’S LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT - THUGS’ POV

They burst into the room see Gennady dead on the floor The
camera WHIP-PANS around No Eddie

BEHIND THE COUCH

Eddie lies panting We HEAR the thugs’ curses
exclamations

And then it hits

We PUSH IN on Eddie’s eyes
He feels it

His old friend MDT

THE THUGS

look up at a NOISE Just in time to see Eddie bolting out
the front door of the apartment

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EDDIE’S APARTMENT —- DAY

They come thundering out -- see a flash of Eddie disappearing
into --

INT THE OPEN DOOR OF THE APARTMENT NEXT DOOR —- NIGHT

We are in jittery handheld THUG’S POV shot as they burst
back in barreling by rooms looking in them pressing on to
more rooms

A MAN’S SHADOWY SHAPE AHEAD IN THE KITCHEN --

Thug 2 BLASTS his GUN the MAN crumples the glass doors
behind him EXPLODE the MAN goes downrevealing Eddie
standing behind him -- (he’s been holding up his neighbors

body) and just as this registers --

WHACK -- Eddie gives THUG 1 a savage shot with a fireplace
poker Thug 1 goes down unconscious the gun skitters
across the floor THUG 2 dives reaches for it Eddie
grabs a piece of the shattered glass and in a vicious swipe
brings it down on the Thug’s hand

But this thug is not a tough Russian motherfucker for
nothing Bleeding profusely he doesn’t let go of the gun
his bloody hand comes up tries to aim

Eddie DIVES BACKWARDS through the broken glass door to the
patio The thug stumbles after him

EXT EDDIE’S NEIGHBOR’S TERRACE —- NIGHT

EDDIE’S HAND still holding glass CUTS the awning-rope
holding up the awning

The awning comes down on the thug a huge canvas curtain
DROPPING between the Thug and Eddie BLAM BLAM Several
holes appear in the canvas as the thug tries to shoot Eddie
anyway but Eddie has leapt out of the way

THUG’S POV - UNDER THE CURTAIN

As he wrestles it off he sees Eddie on the ground
prone just watching him calmly He starts to smirk

Eddie touches a MATCH to the ground

The FLAME shoots across the floor to the thug who now
realizes he’s standing in a puddle the overturned can of BBQ
fluid next to him In an instant his LEGS AND PANTS are on
fire Now the man screams Shoots blindly But - click --
is out of bullets

He rushes at Eddie screaming on fire in animal rage
Eddie brings up a wrought-iron patio chair to meet him
catching him squarely in the ribs He gasps bends over
looks up at Eddie beaten

The face that looks back is without pity

EXT THE CELESTIAL - 20 STORIES BELOW A WIDER TERRACE - DAY

We are looking up at the penthouse A SHAPE is dropping
fast towards us -- the shape of a man

It’s here The man’s head EXPLODES against the railing like
a pumpkin as the rest of him disappears down out of sight

EDDIE (V0)
Later it would be noted that my
neighbor was in the music business
One of his drug deals had obviously
gone bad
(beat)
And the night was still young

INT A HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

A MAN is on a gurney A NURSE puts a sheet over his head
Before our view of his face disappears we realize -- it’s
Hank Atwood Dead

INT HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM —- NIGHT

Tan Coat is sitting stoic and red-eyed in a chair He
senses something Slowly turns his head and looks

EDDIE is sitting in the chair next to him The two men look
at each other for a moment Then

EDDIE

I’m sure you’re not a little curious
about what’s happened to your boss
I certainly am If my attorney was
really working for Mr Atwood to
save his life then why is he dead
At what point was the Pony Express
supposed to ride in with the life-
saving medication

(a beat)
Or did the Pony decide that he
should be running his own Pony show
Minus the dog

Tan Coat stares at him his face without expression

INT A CONNECTICUT UPPERCLASS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

AN UPPERCLASS HOUSEWIFE enters in sweats from the gym
Immediately notices something is not right

INT HER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The place has been ransacked

INT HER BEDROOM —- NIGHT

She rushes in We SEE her husband’s MORRIS BRANDT’S body --
twisted grotesquely on the bed -- neck broken

A PICTURE has been thrown to the floor The WALL SAFE behind
is open

The SAFE is empty

TITLE Eight months later

INT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN OFFICE —- DAY

Desks employees volunteers ringing phones REUBEN LATE
20s sharp a JAMES CARVILLE-TYPE sits on a desk with
casual authority is on the phone

REUBEN
--actually no there’s no more
tickets --Yeah I know an
overbooked fundraiser -- there’s a
first -- well here he comes I’11
ask him -- Edward

We see Eddie striding down the corridor wearing a sharp
suit looking more dignified than we’ve ever seen him more
adult The snap and crackle of something new -- power -- is
in his step TWO MALE AIDES flank him Reuben approaches
falls into step with them

REUBEN
I think we’re looking at a second
overflow event--

EDDIE
Not an option

REUBEN
No not is not the option there’s a
wave of contributors coming in that
I’ve never seen in any campaign --
it’s the debate it just put you
over

EDDIE
We doing another one

REUBEN
(smiles)
They won’t return my calls about
another one There’s also a Newsweek
bite pretty big one--

Eddie arrives at the door to his office
A VERY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG FEMALE INTERN
Holding a clipboard is waiting for him

EDDIE
I’ve got a lunch

The young woman looks up through the door and smiles at
Eddie her eyes shining with the idealistic admiration that
will surely lead to sex

REUBEN
Not yet

EDDIE
Excuse me

REUBEN

Not Yet John Steadman is here

(off Eddie’s blank look)
--Eiben-Chemcorps Look they’re
your biggest contributor give him
his two shitty little minutes

Eddie sighs capitulating Puts his hand on the door
EDDIE

Eiben-Chemcorps What are they --
research

REUBEN
Pharmecuticals

Eddie shoots him a look

INT A LARGE CASUAL OFFICE - DAY

Eddie comes in to find JOHN STEADMAN 50’s well-dressed and
gentlemanly waiting

STEADMAN
Mr Spinola

EDDIE
Nice to see you

He shakes Steadman’s hand but Steadman doesn’t get up Odd
In fact Steadman looks uncommonly relaxed almost slouched in
his chair looking up at Eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye
that Eddie doesn’t recognize

EDDIE
We appreciate everything you’ve done
for us--

STEADMAN

Well you’ve done most of it for
yourself Senator Spinola

He says this with a kind of casual prescient authority
suddenly we know he’s right Eddie will win

STEADMAN
I mean everything from here’s a
technicality isn’t it Eddie

Again that smile Eddie doesn’t know what this guy is
about And nobody calls him “Eddie” any more

STEADMAN
The election a couple of terms I
think we both know where it’s
heading
(a beat)
If you can maintain

EDDIE
I’m really not sure what you’re--

STEADMAN
Have you asked yourself what you’re
going to do when you run out

Eddie blinks at him Did he just say what Eddie thought
said

EDDIE
I don’t think I --

STEADMAN
How much do you have left -- three
months’ worth Four

Eddie is now dead silent Just watching this man
Listening Not wanting to admit to anything

STEADMAN
We can help you there

And

he

Eddie stares at him Is it possible Is he really talking

to someone who makes MDT

STEADMAN
We’ve gotten some of the bugs out
It’s longer lasting -- you’1ll only

need one a week And you can have a
drink without blackouts I’d
certainly be missing cocktail hour if
I were you

A long beat Eddie goes over to the window turns his back
to Steadman looks out Without turning around

EDDIE
Have you been watching me from the
beginning

STEADMAN
No Those of you who indulged
distinguished yourselves very

quickly You made yourselves clear
to us

EDDIE
Whos “us”

Steadman just smiles waves the question away

STEADMAN
You went the furthest with it the
fastest so of course to us you’re
the most interesting

EDDIE
How did it get on the street

STEADMAN
Security breach That was never our
intention We took care of it

Meaning they took care of Vern

STEADMAN
It will never again be on the street
It will never publicly exist
Obviously I don’t need to detail the
advantages for you

A long beat
EDDIE
Why would you invest in me Why
don’t you take it

Steadman is amused by the question

STEADMAN
We don’t have to take it You’ll
take it for us

Eddie doesn’t like the guy Eddie doesn’t like this
conversation Sharply

EDDIE
And do what in return

STEADMAN
Well given where you’re heading
some of our ideas are kind of
grandiose But I think achievable

Eddie takes this in

EDDIE
And if I don’t like your ideas

STEADMAN
Then we’ll say Godspeed And your
candle will shed a brief but lovely
light

Eddie knows now They own his ass Because he needs their
MDT More than anything

STEADMAN
Come on Let’s get some lunch

He starts for the door Eddie remains still Something
flickers in his eyes -- maybe the last flicker we’ll ever see
of the old Eddie

EDDIE
Tell me something

Steadman stops looks back at him

EDDIE
Did I kill that woman

Steadman looks puzzled that Eddie would ask

STEADMAN
Do you really want to know

Eddie thinks His eyes harden No he doesn’t
EXT SPINOLA CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS —- STREET —- DAY

Eddie and Steadman come down the stairs together Powerful

men power suits power stride

EDDIE (V0)

Would it really be so bad Doesn’t
every man on the path to greatness
have to tolerate the wind-drag of
compromise Weren’t the changes that
needed to be made more important

And they’d be improvements My
improvements --Foreign policy the
courts even the Constitution could
stand a little tweaking

Waiting at the curb is a CAR A man standing holding the

door open for Eddie and Steadman
It’s TAN COAT Just doing his job For his new boss
EDDIE (V0)
Id have a scotch with lunch Maybe
two

The camera remains on the buzzing hive that is Eddie’s
building people excitedly coming and going as we--

FADE OUT
