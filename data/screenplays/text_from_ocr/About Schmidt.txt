WARREN SCHMIDT 66 sits at his desk looking up at the clock The
desk is completely clear except for a telephone

Next to the desk are several large CARDBOARD BOXES They are

Helen spots something up ahead

ExT GORAT’S STEAKHOUSE - WIGHT

The Cadillac pulls into the PARKING LOT Credits continue

INT GORAT’S STEAKHOUSE BANQUET ROOM- WIGHT

ON THE WALLS --

framed PHOTOGRAPES of prize-winning cattle that have been
slaughtered for this fine Omaha eatery

WARREN
eats his steak

WIDE --

Twenty or so people sit around a T-shaped table

Warren and Helen
sit at the head

On a side table lie wrapped gifts

Warren happens to be seated right where two tables are joined He

tries crossing his legs and must mask his discomfort

GARY NORDIN 34 Clinks a greasy knife on his water glass His

neck is thick and his Brooks Brothers collar is too tight
GARY

For my part Id just like to say

Warren that as the new guy taking

over for you I hope I can fill your

shoes because from the looks of the

people here and what they think of

you they sure seem awfully big

General courtesy laughter Credits continue

GARY (CONT’D)
As most of you know I recently moved
here from Hartford with my wife Sandy
here and Kimberly our 14-month-old
and you’ve all just made us feel so
welcome and Warren I want you to
feel just as welcome to drop by the
office to visit anytime you want As
weve been discussing in the last
couple weeks I might have some
questions to ask you about our
various accounts and such So
heres to you Warren

He raises his water glass in an awkward toast gesture All join
in Warren manages a smile as everyone mumbles some variation of

“Heres to Warren” or “Were sure going to miss you” or “Good
luck Warren”
A stout older fellow with a loud abrasive voice -- RAY NICROLS —
chimes in

Bey Warren how do you feel about
these young punks taking over our
jobs They shoved me out the door
three years ago Looks like some
kind of conspiracy to me

Everyone laughs affectionately Ray stands

RAY (CONT’D)
Now Ive known Warren here probably °
longer than most of you have been

- - alive Warren-and I go way back
waaaaay back to the horse and buggy
days at Mutual But that’s ancient
history We were good friends not
only at work but also out on the golf
course and on fishing trips up at my
cabin in Minnesota And what I want
to say to you publicly Warren so
all these young hotshots can hear is
that that gold watch there doesn’t
mean a goddamn thing

Warren finally feels a note of connection with someone

RAY (CONT’D)
And this dinner doesn’t mean a
goddamn thing and the social
security and pension don’t mean a
goddamn thing

Ray’s wife MILDRED smiles uncomfortably as she grabs his hand to
get him to take it easy but Ray is on a roll

RAY (CONT’D)
None of these super-fishy-alities
mean a goddamn thing What means
something what really means
something Warren

Ray takes a dramatic drunken pause

RAY (CONT’D)
What really means something is the
knowledge that you devoted your
entire life to something meaningful
- to being productive and working
for a fine company -- hell one of

the biggest insurance carriers in the
Nation --
Ray counts on his fingers and at one point counts the same finger
twice

RAY (CONT’D)
to raising a fine family to
pbuilding a fine home to being
respected by your community and
having some wonderful loyal
friendships

Hearing the part about raising the family Helen puts her hand on
Warren’s but he doesn’t react

RAY (CONT’D)
At the end of his career if a man
can look back and say “I did it I
did my job” he can retire in peace
and glory and enjoy riches far beyond
the monetary kind So all you young
people here here’s a role model
Right here I want you to take a
good look at a very rich man

All applaud Ray leans over the table to shake hands with Warren
In doing so one side of his jacket trails through his mashed

potatoes and gravy Ray sits back down and everyone resumes
eating

Warren looks at his food can’t take another bite He slides
“his chair out

WARREN
(to Helen)
Be right back

ANGLE FROM THE DOOR --
as Warren leaves the room behind him

INT GORAT’S LOUNGE WIGHT

Warren takes a seat at the bar It’s noisy and crowded Theres
a SINGER accompanied by a GUY with a drum machine and keyboard

The BARTENDER puts down a cocktail napkin

BARTENDER
Good evening

WARREN

Warren sits alone at the bar waiting for his drink and waits and
waits -- it seems to take a lifetime

About to lift another bite to his lips Warren stops looks at --

-- Millie wiping mashed potato from both sides of her te
knife onto her fork befGre raising the fork to her mouth
-- Peas falling off a fork bouncing with loud duns

-- extra “au jus” dousing prime rib

WARRENS EYES

dart from place to place Something in the SOUND implies
Warrens distorted -- or very clear -- perception

-- Helens greasy lips part every few chews
A knife cuts through prime rib an abrasive SCREECH as
the knife reaches the plate

The burned-out bulbs on the wagon-wheel chandelier

The waitress’s thick calves beneath thick support hose
- The CLOCK

Warren drops his head pinches the bridge of his nose Helen
notices Warren’s distress and leans over to him But we can’t hear
her dialogue just the distant impression of someone speaking

WARREN

destiny had tapped me to be a great man
-- not like Churchill or Walt Disney or
somebody like that But somebody you
know at least semi-important

A QUICK TILT DOWN STOCK MARKET PRICES
in the newspaper stops on “SCHMIDT INTL”

smile of a powerful industrialist

WARREN (VO CONT’D)
I was going to be one of those guys
you read about

The MAGAZINE FADES AWAY and Warrens arms unfold his smile

vanishes his shoulders drop he turns his back and walks away
getting SMALLER AND SMALLER

WARREN (VO CONTD)

Instead I took a job at Mutual and I
just stuck with it I never made my
move never broke out on my Own as
much as I wanted to I thought I was
doing the right thing — supporting my
family and moving up in a fine company
- but along the way all the dreams I
had as a young man just faded away

CLOSE ON THE LETTER

dreams were just any young man’s
foolish dreams

mind right now

JEANNIE

skating classes at Ak-sar-ben

Jeannie brings over a plate of food and a glass of milk

JEANNIE
Here’s your sandwich

WARREN
Oh wonderful Just wonderful

JEANNIE
You know Dad you’re going to have
to get used to taking care of
yourself now

WARREN
(mid-chew)
Yeah

JEANNIE
You’re not going to have somebody
running your errands for you picking
up your clothes doing the grocery

shopping You might need to hire a
maid or something

WARREN
A maid Oh no no I can take care
of things I don’t need that extra
expense

JEANNIE
Don’t be so stingy I’m going to be
worried about you and —

WARREN
Well that’s why Im asking you to
stay longer and sort of help me out
for a few days

JEANNIE
Dad I have my own life I mean
it’s nice you want me to stay but
leave it alone now

WARREN
(cowed )
Okay I know

JEANNIE
And even if I could get more time
off what am I supposed to do about
the wedding That‘’s like a full-time
job all its own

WARREN
Now that you mention it I’ve been
thinking about that and I was
wondering if maybe you should
consider postponing it
JEANNIE
Postpone the wedding Are you crazy
We cant do that It’s all set
Even if we wanted to we’d have to
wait God-knows-how-many months for
the church again and we’d lose all
our deposits and everything

WARREN
Actually I made a couple calls and
if we made a decision this week wed
Only forfeit half the deposit on the
church and the reception hall Im
just saying-you might want to take
this opportunity to you know
rethink things

JEANNIE
But everyone’s invited and RSVP’d and
everything

WARREN
Theyd understand I mean out of
tespect for your mother

JEANNIE
Mom wouldn’t want us to change
anything I know it

WARREN
(shifting gears)
Well the thing is Jeannie your
mother and I we talked a number of
times very seriously about you and
Randall and

JEANNIE
What did she say

WARREN

Just that that she loved you and she
wanted you to be happy And that
Maybe Randall wasn’t quite well we
both just wanted to make sure youre
not going to have any regrets I
just think you might want to keep
your options open that’s all

Jeannie can’t really comprehend what Warren is saying

JEANNIE
But she helped us pick the date and
everything And I was on the phone
with her almost every day planning
it No I don’t think shed want us
to change it

WARREN
All right Okay Have it your way
You know best You and your mother

They sit in silence a moment

Warren continues to eat Jeannie
sips her beer

te

WARREN (CONTD)
Good sandwich

JEANNIE
(abruptly)
Why did you get such a cheap casket

WARREN
what

JEANNIE
I could tell you got the cheapest
casket Everybody could

WARREN

(swallowing first)
Now that is not true That is not
true I specifically did not choose
as you say the cheapest casket
There was one less expensive which
they showed me and I refused

JEANNIE
You mean a pine box
WARREN
I don’t remember what it was
JEANNIE
So you got the second cheapest
casket
WARREN

If you must put it that way Look I
know youre upset but I don’t think
it‘s right for you to focus on one
little thing and take it out on me

—

JEANNIE
She never got anything she wanted
You never bought her anything

WARREN
Hey hey hey What are you talking
about now What are you saying
What about the Bounder What do you
call that That’s an expensive vehicle
sitting out there I didn’t want to
buy that That was completely your
mother’s idea

JEANNIE
She told me she had to pay for half
of it She had to sell her stock to
pay for it or something

WARREN
That was her decision I was willing
to go as far as the Elite but no
she had to have the Imperial She
wanted the whole she-bang What was
I supposed to do Tell her she
couldn’t It was her money You
can’t call me to task on that one

I believe I mentioned in my previous

Actuarial department at Mutual of
Omaha If I am given a man’s age
profession place of residence

marital status and medical history I

can calculate with great probability
how long that man will live In my

there is an eighty five percent
chance that I will die within eleven
years provided I do not re-marry

years after his wife passed on

wrapped seashell soaps and a stack of designed napkins sit on the
sink basin

Still sniffling Warren enters lowers his trousers and begins to
sit He catches himself and STANDS He reaches to lift the seat
but on second thought leaves it down

“CLOSE ON WARREN

as his stream commences He gets an IDEA -- he raises first one
hand then the other The sound of the stream shifts randomly
from water-on-water to water-on-plastic to water-on-rug

Now Warren begins to turn completely around -- slowly completing

one full cirele then another finally picking up the pace and
SPINNING like a top anointing the entire bathroom

CLOSER to him and just as we’re upon him he OPENS HIS EYES

MOMENTS LATER —
Warren trudges back to the Bounder

CLOSE ON TEE GAS PUMP
as the total passes 4100 with no end in sight

EXT I-80 - CENTRAL NEBRASKA - DAY

Warren’s RV makes its way across this flat sprawling agricultural
landscape The composition of the shots and the music reinforce
Warren’s sense of loneliness and alienation

“At this point youd just be in the

WARREN NOW SEES A BIG SIGN --

“Harold Warp’s Pioneer Village See How America Grew
Next Exit” He beams

EXT MINDEN NEBRASKA - DAY

The Bounderapproaches the compound known as Harold Warp’s Pioneer
Village (Harold Warp by the way invented FLEX-O-GLASS)

As Warren emerges from the Bounder his expression reveals a deep
sense of the moment of arriving at a place long dreamed about

Warren arrives at the FRONT DOOR to the main building and tries to
open it but it’s LOCKED He peers through the window and in the
distance notices a MAN wearing a toolbelt Warren knocks loudly

MAN
(approaching)
We’re closed for repairs Closed
Nobody here Come back after the 22nd

Hows that

MAN
(louder)
We re-open on the 22nd

WARREN
Oh Thank you

INT BOUNDER — DAY

Warren is sitting at his little kitchen table sluggish from his

severe depression He’s trying to write but the words are coming
slowly painfully

and tearing up the letter

INT THE BOUNDER —- DAY
Warren is driving a desperate look on his bleary face

WARREN (VO CONT”D)

been feeling a little d down iately a ‘e

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

The big Bounder rolls along heading toward a mournful sunset

WARREN (VO CONTD)
So I decided to visit some places I
hadnt been to in a long time and
maybe try to figure out what has made
my who I am today There’s so much
of my life I can’t seem to remember
Ngudu whole sections of my life that
are just gone

The Bounder now takes an EXIT

WARREN (VO CONT ’D)
So my first stop was none other than
Holdridge Nebraska I thought it
might be a good idea to re-visit the
house where I was born sixty-seven
years ago next March

EXT HOLDRIDGE NEBRASKA - DAY
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

The “Welcome to Holdridge” sign replete with the traditional logo
of Rotary Kiwanis and Lions

WARREN (VO CONT’D)
We moved away from Holdridge when I was
not much older than you and I’ve often
wondered what our old house looks like
today Funny I never forgot the
address -- 249 Locust Avenue I
remember my Dad saying he paid 11500
for that place Believe it or not
that was a lot of money in those days

A STREET SIGN -- LOCUST AVENUE
WARREN LOOKS AT IT

breathes a satisfied breath as he guides his vessel aroundthe
corner

WARREN (VO CONTD)
249 Locust Avenue Yes sir

He looks out the window scanning the addresses All these old
houses 225 229 237 243 and finally --

EXT FOUR-DAY TIRE STORE - DAY

Looks as if that lot was re-zoned

At first crestfallen Warren quickly decides to make the best of
it He’s come all these miles waited all these years

The Bounder pulls into the parking lot

INT FOUR-DAY TIRE STORE - DAY

Warren walks into this modern tire store as though walking
reverently into his past It’s all coming back to him

A chipper TIRE SALESMAN named KEN comes up

KEN
Can I help you sir

WARREN
No that’s okay I’m just looking
around I used to live here

KEN
Here in the store

WARREN

Yep My childhood home was right on
this spot

(walking a few steps

extending his hands)
In fact my bedroom would have been
right about here the dining room
over there and --

(catching himself)
Of course that was a long time ago
Way before you were born

Warren wanders off lost in his memories The MUSIC SWELLS with a
nostalgic and romantic sense of the past

-

SOUNDS FROM THE PAST

now filter in -- a child practicing piano a lively dinner a
lovingly scolding mother a game of hopscotch a barking dog
Warren looks wistfully out the store’s front window

WARREN (CONT’D)
You‘re not going to believe this but

we used to have a tire swing right
out front

KEN
Huh Well listen you let me know
if you need any help with some tires
today My name’s Ken

WARREN
(touched)
Thank you

EXT FOURDAY TIRE STORE - DAY

On his way back to the Bounder Warren surveys the parking lot as
though it were still his front yard

receptacle

with vim

EXT UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS CAMPUS - DAY

WARREN
You see that tower In my day kids

unfurl a Go Kansas banner before big
football games

DAVE

hilarious

Warren has no idea what a bong is

WARREN
A bong huh That’s great

DAVE
(pointing)
Last but not least here is the
Schuyler Student Center

THE SCHUYLER STUDENT CENTER

is an immense sprawling edifice Above the front doors in
gigantic letters are the words “Schuyler Student Center”

Dave starts to walk toward it but Warren balks -- he rubs the
back of his neck feigns fatigue

WARREN
Say Dave I think I’ve had a little
too much excitement for one day I
should let you focus on your studies
DAVE
At least poke your head in and have a
look at the frescoes

WARREN
I know where it is now so I can come
back Thanks a lot for your
hospitality and the tour and

through the blurry shower door humming an old tune

EXT BETA SIGMA - NIGHT

The Bounder rolls up and comes to a stop

INT BOUNDER - NIGHT

Warren opens the little vanity mirror inside the visor and combs
his hair checks his appearance

INT BETA SIGMA — NIGHT

FRATERNITY and SORORITY STUDENTS mill about the lower floor

There i
music but no one dances There is beer but few drink Dave spoke
correctly -- it is indeed more of a reception than a party and there
stiffness about the affair

Warren comes through the front door
beneath his jacket

He wears a sporty pole shirt
He smiles warmly at no one in particular as he enters the main
room He even seems to have a little bounce in his step He
looks around amicably for a familiar face He finds none and

there is that awkwa ment of a nice guy in limbo at a party

He spots the drinks table and heads thither A young man acts as
BARTENDER

BARTENDER
Yes sir Are you looking for someone

WARREN

Im looking for a cold beer is what
I‘m looking for

BARTENDER
You got it

The young man begins to fill a plastic cup from the keg

WARREN
And none of this ‘sir’ stuff I‘m
one of your Beta Sig brothers

BARTENDER
Oh right You were the guy at
lunch Right Roger Schuyler’s
roommate

WARREN
I taught him everything he knows

Chuck and Phil sidle up Chuck puts his arm around Warrens
shoulder

CHUCK
(to the bartender)
Did you check this guy’s ID He
looks a little young to be drinking

They laugh and Warren laughs a little too hard

WARREN
check my ID

PHIL
Chuck wants to introduce you when he
gives his corny little welcoming
speech and all That okay with you

WARREN
Oh like I‘m a visiting dignitary

CHUCK
Well since you have been out of
school for a couple of years we want
some tips on what to do when we
graduate

They laugh again and again Warren does so a bit too effusively

CHUCK

So you having a good time
WARREN

The time of my life It really takes

me back to when I was you fellas’ age

Doesnt feel as though any time has

passed at all But you guys are a

little too low-key here I mean c’mon

When we had fraternity parties in my
day we used to let it all hang out

CHUCK
Oh it can get pretty wild sometimes
Youd be proud of us

WARREN
I don’t know I‘m still a little
disappointed in you guys I’m going
to have to include this in my report

Warren CHUGS the rest of his beer and motions to the bartender to
fill it up again
LATER

President Chuck addresses the faithful

CHUCK
and the second letter Sigma is the
eighteenth letter of the Greek
alphabet As you math types know --
but Ill say it for the benefit of us
normal people -- Sigma in math is the
mathematical symbol meaning the
“summation of all the figures ina
problem” So I want you new pledges
and little sisters to remember that as
Beta Sigmas we are a whole we are the
summation of all our component parts

ANGLE ON WARREN

sitting in a chair in a corner Hes a little drunk by now
is studying something in the palm of his hand

WARRENS HAND -- -

containing a little piece of PAPER with notes for a speech

WARREN LOOKS UP AND BLINKS
trying to memorize his remarks

CBUCK (CONT’D)
We are a family of brothers and
sisters and with the concepts of
Beta and Smigma we can achieve more
together than we ever could as
individuals For he who stands away
from the pack can never be dealt with
or played with I hereby welcome you
into this elite club

All applaud or raise their glasses

CBUCK (CONTD)
There‘s one more thing I want to
mention and that is that we have
with us tonight a very special guest
He’s right over there in the corner—

Warren stands up almost at attention

CHUCK (CONT’D)
and no hes not some graduate
student crashing the party

Warren gets a big kick out of that

He

CHUCK (CONT’D)
He’s one of us -- a veteran Beta Sig
brother from yesteryear who
represents our very special heritage

Warren is listening but also still going over the speech in his mind

CHUCK (CONT’D)
You know the men of Beta Sigma are a
unique breed who leave their
unmistakable stamp on history Beta
Sigs are found in every walk of life
and in all fifty states Most
recently of course Roger Schuyler a
Beta Sig from this very chapter and
head of one the nation’s largest
construction firms based out of
Chicago designed and donated our new
student center And now Id like to
present you to someone who in this very
house was Roger Schuyler’s roommate

The applause is so thunderous that no one hears Warrens name

CHUCK (CONTD)
Warren Spitz

SMILING FACES

of those applauding proud to have in their presence a man once in
such proximity to greatness

Warrens smile wilts before he politely freshens it He slips the
piece of paper into his jacket pocket

The music comes back on and people return to talking A young
man approaches Warren

YOUNG MAN
So what was Roger Schuyler like You
guys stay in touch

WARREN
(confidential at first)
You want to know what Roger Schuyler
was like He was a selfish jerk
That guy cheated and screwed around
and treated everybody like dog you
know poop

MORE

WARREN (CONTD)
(getting fired up)
- and now he’s running around like
he‘s some kind of bigshot You want
to guess who did his Statistics final
that time so he could get an A and
get into Phi Beta Kappa and all that
(jabbing a finger into his
own shoulder)
Me Youre looking at him Me that’s
who He mention that in his book

YOUNG MAN
I don’t know a

Warren now spots Dave nearby and breaks away

WARREN (CONT ’D)
Hey Dave Dave Come here Let me
buy you a little drinky-winky

He takes Dave by the arm and drags him to the drinks table

WARREN (CONT ’D)
Two beers please

DAVE
No beer for me I still have two
chapters to review for tomorrow
I‘ll have a Diet Coke

WARREN

I can’t get over you guys No
drinking no carousing no carrying
on at all I thought you college
kids -- let me tell you something
and I want you to listen very hard
That test tomorrow is meaningless

(he’s starting to slur)
The senselessness of it all is going
to hit you someday like a ton of
bricks What matters now is to enjoy
your youth Do you hear me Live
it up a little Let me show you how
we used to do it in my day

Warren takes his beer lifts it to his lips takes a deep breath
and chugs the whole thing little streams of beer trailing down

the sides of his mouth and onto his neck He slams the plastic
cup onto the table

WARREN
Fill her up partner With ethyl if
you got it

Be does so and Warren downs this one even faster

WARREN
Aaaaaah Thats better Now that’s
two for me and zero for you C’mon

do yourself a favor Youve got to
live life

DAVE

Well maybe just one I had a big
dinner anyway

WARREN
That’s the spirit

He slaps Dave hard on the back They take their beers
WARREN
One two three

Down the old hatcharoo warren finishes his slower this time and
not without gagging noises Dave takes only a sip

WARREN
Set ‘em up again

DAVE
Dont you think youd better slow
down a little Mr Schmidt

WARREN
Slow down You think I ought to SLOW
DOWN I’ve been slowing down all ny
goddamn life I’ve had enough slow
down here slow down there slow down

left and right and over there YOU
slow down

Everyone has now quieted and turned to look at the scene by the

drinks table Warren reels around Dave is on the verge of
tears

WARREN (CONT’D)
What are you all looking at me like
that for This guy thinks I should
slow down I think you should all be
speeding up Let’s have a party

He starts to dance grotesquely around the room exhorting all to
join his festive mood

WARREN (CONTD)
Cmon everybody let’s have a party
Let’s sing some drinking songs and
have a real party C’mon you guys

He grabs a pretty YOUNG WOMAN and begins to dance with her

Warren releases the unresponsive girl seizes a PLEDGE and now
starts to dance with him

Finally stumbles and falls but gets back up again

WARREN (CONT”D)
Why are you all so BORING You know
who I am I’m Roger Schuyler’s
roommate I’m Roger fucking Schuyler’s
roommate But he didn’t build that
building I did He‘s MY roommate
It’s MY building

Someone has cut the music by this time and between Warren’s words
is a terrible silence

He collapses in a chair and his voice trails off He slumps

mouth open He blinks heavily and we cut to his blurred point of
view

Everyone is still Chuck motions to Phil They walk over and
hoist Warren out of the chair As they drag him out of the room

we occasionally cut to Warren’s point of view -- the traveling
floor the stunned onlookers

CHUCK
Son of a bitch Grab his coat and
let’s get him the fuck out of here

They reach the little steps that lead to the front hall and
Warren’s feet knock against them as he is pulled up

On the last step Warren’s feet are knocked so hard that his FALSE
LOWER TEETH fall out and roll on the carpet

PHIL
What was that

CHUCK
Oh for Christ’s sake

Following them Dave dutifully picks up the denture with a piece
of newspaper

INT BOUNDER -— NIGHT

The door is flung open and Warren is heaved upon his bed Phil

and Chuck leave Dave lays the denture on the kitchen table and
leaves —

now fits the plate back in his mouth He looks haggard and drawn
As he turns away from the sink his head throbs even more
severelyand he holds his head sits down

WARREN (VO)
Well Ngudu I’m happy to report that
the campus may have changed a bit
but it was the same old KU I
remember full of friendship and
camaraderie

Louis arch visitors can climb to the top for a fine view and shop
at the gift store on their way out

WARREN (VO CONTD)
I finally went up into the new arch
over the interstate outside Kearny
Climbing all 179 steps

EXT “THINGS ‘NW STUFF” ANTIQUE STORE - DAY
A typical roadside bric-a-brac place
WARREN (VO CONT’D)
And you know I pull the Bounder
over whenever I feel like stretching
my legs taking in a local sight or
browsing for antiques

INT ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

Warren is browsing inside

WARREN (VO CONTD)
The other day for example at an
antique store in Cozad I came across
a fine collection of rare Hummels

THE ADORABLE HUMMEL FIGURINES --

now at the cash register — a CLOG DANCER a BOBO a CHILD PLAYING
AN ACCORDIAN

WIDE --
Warren is talking to the rather LARGE WOMAN who owns the shop

WARREN (VO CONTD)
The owner told me that Hummels aside -
from being very decorative increase
in value on average 6 a year
provided they are kept in mint
condition

INT BOUNDER - NIGHT

Warren is at his dinette table eating soup and admiring the
HUMMELS laid out in front of him

WARREN (VO CONTD)
Helen loved Hummels

VICKI
Oh you shouldn’t have

WARREN
(sniffing the air)
Smells de-lish

Vicki goes to the stove and stirs a pot

VICKI
I hope you like chicken

WARREN
Oh yeah

A FLUSH is heard and almost simultaneously John Rusk emerges from
the bathroom between Vicki and Warren

JOEN
There he is

WARREN
Hey

They shake hands like old friends

JOEN
Can I take your coat

WARREN
Sure

Warren removes his coat While John puts it on a mini-hanger in
the tiny closet Warren smells a new odor

WARREN (CONTD)
Something burning

JOEN

Hmm Oh no I just lit a couple of
matches is all

WARREN
Oh

The limited space inside the Bounder requires all three occupants
constantly to maneuver around one another

JOEN
Shall we adjourn to the living room
while Vickis -- you’re almost ready
aren’t you hon

VICKI
Just about John Warren brought
beer
JOEN

Why thank you Warren Have a seat

Warren and John sit side-by-side on the sofa-bed sofa

WARREN
So what do you do back in Eau Claire
JOEN
My brother and I have little shoe
store
WARREN
Shoes huh
JOEN

It’s a Famous Footwear Yes sir

people will always need shoes And

Vicki here’s an occupational ‘©
therapist So that’s our day job

you might say But now that the kids

are on their own weve got it

structured so as we can be on the

road free as the wind about five

months a year How about yourself

WARREN
I was in the insurance game but I‘m
retired now

VICKI
(putting salad dressing
bottles on the table)
Dinners ready

JOHN
(motioning Warren to join him)
Why don’t you tell us about it over
supper

They walk the two steps to the dining area It’s all so small and
awkward They SQUEEZE into their seats but once settled John
Slaps his hands together expressing great satisfaction

LATER --

They are lingering over coffee and poppy-seed cake They’ve eaten
well drunk well and have clearly bonded in the benevolent
glowing light of Bounder spirit

The Rusks have dragged out their FAMILY PHOTO ALBUM and are
showing it to Warren

VICKI
And this is Roger and Denise and
their daughters

WARREN
Now Denise is your oldest
VICKI
No she’s the middle one They’re
out in Delaware And these little
cuties are Katie and Sloan

WARREN

A girl named Sloan Never heard that

JOHN AND VICKI
(with a laugh)
Neither had wel

JOHN

Do you have any pictures of your
daughter with you

WARREN
Hmmm No Not on me

JOHN
Nothing in your wallet

WARREN

VICKI

VICKI

arrangements and all

WARREN
I’m on my way

JOHN
What did you get them for a wedding
present
WARREN

Well I figured I’m paying for the
wedding so

JOEN
(chuckling)
Oh yeah I know how you feel Had
two daughters of my own No but
seriously what’re you getting them

oe WARREN-

(stumped)
Um I guess some kind of cookware or
small appliance or something Maybe
a gift certificate

VICKI
Oh that’s always good Then they
can get what they want

JOHN

You never have to return a gift
certificate that’s for sure

(noticing)
Jeez looks like were a little low
on truth serum here If I go out for
another six-pack you guys going to
be okay

WARREN
Oh yeah

LATER —-

Warren and Vicki are alone now and they have repaired to the
“salon” area of the Bounder Vicki is perched with her legs
tucked under her like a middle-aged slightly overweight
Midwestern Scotch-German Erté nymph

WARREN
Yep that’s quite a family you got
there You and John are very lucky

VICKI
Yes we are
(shifting gears)
Warren may I make an observation
WARREN
Sure

VICKI
And you wont get offended

WARREN
I don’t think so

VICKI
Well you put a pretty good face on

things considering all youve been
through lately

Warren just nods a little unsure where this is going

VICKI (CONTD)
And I’ve only just met you but I
have a good instinct about people
And what I’m feeling from you is that
despite your good humor and your
positive outlook inside you‘re a
very sad man

WARREN
Well you know it is quite an
adjustment there when you lose a
spouse

VICKI
But it’s more than that something
more than grief and loss I see in
you Something deeper

WARREN
Like like what

VICKI
Oh I don’t know you well enough But
I’m guessing anger Yes anger
Maybe I don’t know Fear
Loneliness

Warren says nothing He suddenly feels very naked

WARREN
(low)
I ama little lonely

VICKI
I knew it You see

WARREN
Youre a very understanding woman
VICKI

I know A lot of people say that

WARREN

(gathering his courage)
You want to know the real truth

VICKI
I’m listening

‘ I couldnt And my life

4 think I’ve wasted my life my whole

life is just—

Warren trails off overcome by his own honesty

to comfort him touching his shoulder

VICKI

Oh you sad man You sad sad man

He bends his head to rest it on Vicki’s shoulder

WARREN
I didn’t love my wife Maybe I never
loved her Not the way she deserved
I just couldnt give her everything
she needed to be happy I couldn’t—

Vicki reaches out

A little

uncomfortable with the whole situation but ever the gracious

hostess Vicki gently cradles his head

VICKI (CONT’D)
You sad man

The intimacy the alcohol the intoxicating scent of Vickis
1900 perfume -- it’s all too much for vulnerable Warren

Suddenly he seizes her head and presses his lips against her

mouth He even whimpers

VICKI
(pushing him away)
What are you doing

Warren dives for her lips again but Vicki turns stern She

SHOVES Warren away stands up

VICKI

I don’t know what kind of ideas
you’ve got mister but I think you

need to leave now

Warren just stands there surprised by his own actions and by

Vicki’s reaction

VICKI (CONT’D)
You need to leave now

WARREN
I’m sorry 0h God I didn’t mean tow

I was just I mean you understand
me and I

VICKI
(now frightened)
Get out Get out

Warren gets to his feet his shame palpable

Could I get my coat please

Vicki reaches into the little closet and hands Warren his jacket

EXT KOA CAMPGROUND - NIGHT

Warren now scampers back across the campground He reaches his
Bounder and starts to DISCONNECT it from the hook-ups

INT WARRENS BOUNDER - NIGHT

Warren steps up Climbs into the driver’s seat and starts the
engine

EXT CAMPGROUND - WIGHT

Warren backs out his RV and heads toward the exit

INT BOUNDER NIGHT
WARREN’S POV --

As he turns into the road his headlights find a solitary figure
Why it‘s JOBN RUSK just back from his trip to the corner Looks
like he got a whole case too not just a six-pack

Unsure how to react to what looks like Warrens Bounder John
gives a little aborted wave

Warren keeps his eyes straight ahead and SPEEDS UP

EXIT HIGHWAY -- DAWH

Sunrise finds the Bounder on the shoulder as a HIGHWAY PATROL car

pulls up behind it The PATROLMAN gets out and walks up to the
drivers window

There’s Warren passed out against the steering wheel a thick
strand of DROOL hanging from his open mouth He seems dead RAP-

RAP-RAP Warren startles awake looks around disoriented finally
slides open his window

PATROLMAN
Need any assistance

WARREN
No I was just a little too tired

last night to go on so I pulled
over

PATROLMAN
It’s illegal to park on the shoulder
And extremely dangerous Theres a
KOA campground about 12 miles back

WARREN
I must have missed that

PATROLMAN
Im not going to write you up but you’re
going to need to move your vehicle

WARREN
Im just going out to Denver to see my
daughter She’s getting married and --

PATROLMAN
Well she’ll want you to get there in
one piece

The patrolman leaves Warren gathers himself together starts the
Bounder up and pulls off the shoulder out onto the high-speed
interstate ready for adventure

WARREN (VO)

As my journey draws to a close I
reflect back on all I’ve seen and
done and Y think it’s been a good
trip a rewarding trip And last
night my final night on the road
was the best of all It was a very
special night

EXT WOODED AREA - DUSK

The Bounder makes its way down a pastoral tree-lined gravel road

WARREN (VO CONTD)
I’d spent a wonderful day driving in
the North Platte area Ona lark I
turned down a country road and
before you know it I found myself in
a very lovely wooded area

LATER -

Warren steps out of the Bounder and looks around him at the thick

shrubbery He canhear the nearby creek He keeps looking around
-- what a lovely Spot

WARREN (VO CONT‘D)

It was so quiet And I was all
alone and — bear with me here — I
felt something sort of come over me
like a sense of peace you might
say Nature can do that to you
sometimes — make you feel all small
and overpowered Make you think
about things Important things

LATER —
Warren sits OUTSIDE the Bounder on a folding chair drinking a
Scotch and enjoying the smells and sounds

WARREN (VO CONTD)
Long story short I decided to be
adventurous and spend the night right

there
LATER —
Warren is now ON TOP OF THE BOUNDER wrapped in a blanket

WARREN (VO CONT’D)
Just me and my thoughts and God’s great
universe stretched out above me

We notice that Warren is looking at —
THE HUMMELS
all laid out in front of him illuminated by a couple of CANDLES

WARREN

picks up one of the Hummels and kisses it before replacing it
alongside the others

WARREN

(addressing the Hummels)
Helen Belen I miss you so much
This trip would have made you so
happy Ive seen so many things Ive
wanted to show you and thought so
many thoughts I wish I could have
shared with you Oh Helen

(losing it)
I forgive you I forgive you for
Ray I know it was a long time ago
and maybe I wasn’t the king of kings
But I tried I tried real hard I’m
sorry I let you down

(dissolving in tears now

addressing the sky)
Helen I miss you so much Can you
forgive me Can you ever forgive me

THE BLACK SKY THE INFINITE STARS -—
As Warrens sobs continue

WARREN (VO)

And lying outside looking up at all
the stars I had a sort of Epiphany
The universe or Helen or something
seemed to be telling me there were
certain things I had to clear up
certain situations I had to set right

Just then — a SHOOTING STAR goes by

WARREN --

moved by the miracle he just witnessed mouths a silent wish and
awkwardly crosses himself

LATER —

It’s DAWN now and Warren bundled up in blankets atop the
Bounder is awakened by his own SHIVERING and CHATTERING TEETE
FROM BELOW —

Warren peeks over the edge —- it’s a long way down and he’s cold
and stiff Warren turns around easing a foot over to search for
the first step on the ladder After a clumsy and protracted
struggle he finally manages to lower his aching body back to

Earth
LATER —

The Bounder pulls out abruptly and the forgotten Hummels tumble
off the roof SMASHING TO BITS on the road

EXT PAYPHONE SOMEWHERE — DAY
Warren has just finished dialing

WOMAN’S VOICE (ON PHONE)
You have reached the voice mailbox

WARREN (VO)

Yes sir no more pussy-footing around
for yours truly From now on Im
going to do exactly what I want and
say exactly what I feel

The WAITRESS comes over pen and pad at the ready

WARREN
I‘d like a plain omelet no potatoes

tomatoes instead a cup of coffee and
wheat toast

WAITRESS 7
No substitutions

WARREN
Oh Okay 111 just have the
potatoes then

WAITRESS

The waitress takes Warren’s menu

He picks up his pen to finish
his letter

WARREN (VO CONTD)

Well I‘11 close now and get this
little travelogue in the post before I
cross over into Colorado and head on
into Denver Wish me luck -- I might

get there So until next time this is
you trusty correspondent Warren R
Schmidt signing off

EXT POST OFFICE - BRULE NEBRASKA - DAY

Warren mails the letter at a mailbox outside this small-town post
office and bounds back to the Bounder

EXT HIGHWAY — DAY

The Bounder zooms past us DENVER looms in the distance

EXT DENVER RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK

An older neighborhood with lots of trees and large rambling homes

The Bounder creeps around a corner

EXT HERTZEL BOUSE - DUSK

Warren ascends the front steps of this large older home with a big
wooden porch and RINGS THE DOORBELL

A few moments later the door is opened by ROBERTA HERTZEL a
large grand woman in a long flowing muu-muu and festooned with

enormous jade jewelry -- necklace jangling bracelets and rings
Oh and no bra

ROBERTA
(extending her hand)
Warren how grand to see you again

WARREN
Hope I’m not intruding

ROBERTA
Not at all I was happy to get your
call and learn that you were finally
in town

WARREN
I dont suppose Jeannie’s here yet

ROBERTA

They should be over in about an hour
Come on in

INT HERTZEL LIVING ROOM DUSK

Roberta leads Warren into this much lived-in house takes his
coat
ROBERTA

I sent you a card Did you get my
card

WARREN
(no idea)

Oh yes Very nice card Thank you
Lovely card

ROBERTA
But I want to say it to you in
person I am so sorry about Helen
I met her only that once but as you
know we talked often on the phone
after the engagement She was a

fine fine woman A fine fine human
being
That sits there a moment

LATER

WARREN
Thank you And of course you know we

had planned to do this traveling
together

ROBERTA
You poor thing

WARREN
Thats why we bought the Bounder

ROBERTA
We all miss her Just tragic

ROBERTA (CONTD)
So what can I get you to drink I
bet that you would like a cocktail

WARREN
(holding up his hand)
Oh no I’m fine 1’11 wait till the
kids get here

ROBERTA
Well I am having a Manhattan

WARREN
What the hell Make it two

Roberta and Warren sit on the sofa in the living room

ROBERTA

Ocoooceh That’s better This last
week has been very stressful The
only way Helen is lucky -- and I mean
the only way -- is that she didn’t
have to go through this week with
Jeannie and me

(with melodic cadence)
The church The caterer The
florist The dress The relatives
The travel arrangements The motels
The bridesmaids The groomsmen The
gowns Do you realize how many
people still have not RSVPd I
spent the morning tracking them down
Warren it does not stop
om

WARREN
Thanks for taking such good care of
everything

ROBERTA
But I don’t want to trouble you with
all of this Youve had a wonderful

trip and I do not want to spoil that
for you

Yes she does

ROBERTA (CONT’D)
By the way we do still need that
check for the church Did Jeannie
mention it to you Because weve
needed it for a few days now and it
has actually been a bit of a problem

WARREN
Oh Jeez Ive sort of been in my
own little world and I guess I must
have missed that
(getting up)
I’1l run out to the Bounder right now
and get my checkbook

ROBERTA
(waving him to sit still)
Oh no Nonsense It can wait You
sit still and finish your drink I
want to hear all about your trip

Suddenly some GUY yells from the kitchen

VOICE
Roberta Ro-BERT-a

ROBERTA
(yelling back)
What

VOICE
I can’t get the goddamn thing off
How do you turn this thing off

ROBERTA
(to Warren)
Would you excuse me

Roberta gets up and wafts away the ice clinking in her drink
She pushes her way through the swinging kitchen door
ROBERTA (0S)
What is your fucking problem Don’t
you think I have enough to deal with

LARRY (0S)
That’s why I offered to come over and
help I am trying to help you

ROBERTA (0S)
Well this is no help Look at it
What do you expect me to do now

LARRY (0S)
I’1ll do it if you just tell me what
you want I’m not a mind-reader

ROBERTA (0S)
Forget it I’ll do it Just like I

have to do everything around here
Get out

LARRY (0S)
I am not a mind-readeri I AM NOT A
MIND-READER

ROBERTA (0S)
Do you understand English Get out

She pushes her way back through the swinging door
next to Warren Her face is flushed

ROBERTA
I’m sorry
(a long exhale)
You met Larry last time didn’t you

WARREN
Just briefly

The back door SLAMS loudly

ROBERTA
Larry is like a little boy Ever
since our divorce he thinks the only
way he can get my attention is to
cause a fuss I understand it I
do I feel sorry for him I just
My first husband was the same way

WARREN
I didn’t know you were married before

She sits again

ROBERTA
It lasted nineteen months He turned
into a real horse’s ass

WARREN
Buh

ROBERTA
But Im sure things will be different
for Jeannie and Randall Now Randall
- he really knows how to treat a
woman Honestly don’t you think
Randall is something special

WARREN
He’s well I know Jeannie seems to
be rather taken with hin

ROBERTA
That always helps doesn‘t it

Warren gives his best courtesy laugh

ROBERTA (CONT’D)
You know when I had my hysterectomy
that boy did not leave my side for
one minute Not one minute People
used to raise their eyebrows because
I nursed him until he was almost
five but I think the results speak
for themselves I raised a very
sensitive devoted boy who has turned
into a sensitive devoted man And
he’s also quite easy on the eye if I
do say so myself Don’t you agree

As though on cue Jeannie and Randall walk in the front door
Randall is wearing the worn-out suit and bad tie of a waterbed
salesman and is carrying a large BOX
ROBERTA
Look who’s here
RANDALL
Hey Dad How’s it hanging

Randall puts down the box and hugs his future father-in-law
Warren responds as best he can

WARREN
Fine

RANDALL
You’re here I’m stoked
Warren releases Randall and turns to his daughter

JEANNIE
Bi Dad

WARREN
Hi sweetheart

They embrace

JEANNIE
So how was your trip
WARREN
Great Just great
RANDALL
Great
WARREN

Ran into a little traffic coming into
town this afternoon Ended up
veering off 90 onto the 6 but that
wasn’t any better Must have been an
accident or construction or
something

RANDALL
That’s Denver for you

ROBERTA
You won’t catch me driving on the
interstate

RANDALL
What you want to do next time is get
off at Capitol Avenue and take it
about four miles up to 75 Head
west and thatll lead you directly
to Kingsley Ave

WARREN
Thanks for the tip

ROBERTA
(indicating the box)
Here Randall bring that into the
kitchen

Roberta and Randall exit and Jeannie starts to follow

WARREN
Jeannie if you’ve got a moment I
need to talk to you about something

8
JEANNIE
Can it wait I want to help these
guys

WARREN

It’s very important I just need a
few minutes alone with you

JEANNIE
Okay Dad No problem Later
INT ROBERTA’S DINING ROOM - WIGHT
CLOSE ON RANDALL

eating his food The way he eats his pork chops says it all --
cutting farmer style switching hands dousing his bites in

ketchup and apple sauce smacking loudly

WARREN
watches him from across the dinner table These are
lips that kiss my daughter’s flesh And he looks at

ROBERTA And at -

LARRY and SAUNDRA (well meet them shortly) And --

DUNCAN

He is clearly Randall’s younger brother Same hair
mustaches same sloped forehead And at --

JEANNIE
next to him She seems to be smacking a little too

WARREN
Say Randall how’d that investment
situation work out for you You
never called me

No one speaks Randall turns a little pale

LARRY
Don’t bring that up

DUNCAN

Turned out to be some kind of pyramid
scheme

RANDALL
No it wasn’t

DUNCAN
All I know is I lost eight hundred
bucks

the greasy

same

RANDALL
Well if youd stuck with it a little
longer you would have seen results
Guaranteed You bailed out too soon

ROBERTA
Can we change the subject please

RANDALL
See you just didn’t find enough
quality reps of your own and you
screwed the whole thing up for ma
too You never really took the time
-to understand how the “power” system -
works
(counting on his fingers)
Principal ownership wealth uh

ROBERTA
Boys let’s change the subject

DING-DING-DING --
Larry clinks his knife to his glass and stands

LARRY
Well as father of the groom I’d
just like to welcome our guest and --

ROBERTA
Larry we know who you are and
youre going to have plenty of
chances to make toasts tomorrow and
the next day

LARRY
Would you let me finish Please

ROBERTA
Cant we just enjoy our food

LARRY
Go ahead -- enjoy your food But I
have something to say

(clearing his throat)

I just want to acknowledge that we
are gathered together around this
table as a family for the very first
time And I wanted to welcome
Warren who has journeyed a very long
way to be with us here tonight So
Warren welcome

MORE

LARRY (CONTD)

(squeezing Saundra’s shoulder)
And on behalf of Saundra and myself

very much Right Saundra

SAUNDRA
Yes we do We love her
ROBERTA
7 Okay Larry That’s enough Save it ‘

“for tomorrow

LARRY
(sitting back down)

and I’m already done
(extending his glass)
To our family

All extend their glasses and clink all except Roberta Everyone
resumes eating

JARREN

Ww
Thank you Larry Thank you very
much

Jeannie leans across Randall to KISS Larry on the cheek

JEANNIE
That was lovely Larry Thank you

Warren notices this closeness between Jeannie and her in-laws He
then looks at -

RANDALL
who has resumed eating

LATER BY THE FRONT DOOR --

Warren is exchanging pleasant good-byes with Larry Saundra and
Duncan but he’s fishing for a moment with Jeannie

WARREN
(finding his chance)
Say Jeannie how about that few
minutes alone

JEANNIE
Oh yeah Right I forgot

She shoots a glance at Randall on his way out the door

RANDALL
We got a pretty big day tomorrow

JEANNIE
(to Warren)
Can it wait

WARREN

Actually no Just give me a few
minutes

Jeannie looks at Randall with a look of “I have to do this”

RANDALL
Take your time Ill get the car started

Warren and Jeannie go out onto the --

EXT FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

It’s a screened in porch -- wicker furniture a porch swing
burned-down candles

JEANNTE
Okay So what’s up

WARREN

Like I said I’ve been doing a lot of
thinking

JEANNIE
And

Dare he He hesitates but he has come too far traveled too many
miles
WARREN

And long story short I think
youre making a big mistake

(lowering his voice)
Don’t marry this guy Don’t do it
You‘ll regret it sooner or later I
know it I just know it

Jeannie searches his face incredulous
WARREN (CONTD)

Don’t marry Randall Im begging
you

JEANNIE
(finally as if to a child)

Okay Dad Calm down It’s okay
You’re just wigging out a little I
totally get it You’re really tired
It’s been a very emotional period for
all of us and Moms gone and she’s
not here anymore to calm you down --

WARREN
No you‘’re not listening Youve got to
listen to me This guy he’s just not
up to snuff You know he’s just sow

HONK HONK --
Randall is just so impatient

JEANNIE
Dad I’ve always known youve had
some misgivings about Randall but
you just don’t know him well enough
People have told me all sorts of
stories about parents freaking out at
the last minute It’s natural to be
afraid to let your daughter go

WARREN
No This is not like that

HONK HONK HONK --

JEANNIE
Dad I gotta go Listen get some
sleep Let’s just forget we had this
conversation Tomorrow’s a really

super-busy day Everythings going to

of teenage Randall in his basketball uniform

A ROW OF RIBBONS
all reading “PARTICIPANT”

A DIPLOMA

congratulating Randall Hertzel for completing a two-week
electronics class

WARREN
is dressed in pajamas and brushing his teeth as he takes in
Randall’s old room a museum of Randalls mediocre adolescence

NOW EXITING THE ADJOINING BATRROOM -
Warren gets into Randall’s bed and is mildly alarmed to discover

that it’s a WATERBED But soon he gets his sea legs and turns out
the light

LYING IN BED --
Warren closes his eyes

FADE TO BLACK

UNDER BLACK
The TICKING of a clock The ticking grows steadily LOUDER

MORNING --

Warren opens his eyes The ticking continues Warren looks up at -

A WALL CLOCK
hanging near the bed It’s a battery-operated BUDWEISER clock

WARREN

now realizes where he has awakened He rolls over to get out of the
water bed but can’t Ouch What’ S going on

Warren now realizes he has a TERRIBLE PAIN IN BIS NECK AND SHOULDER
He contorts around keeping his head rigidly fixed makes another
failed sloshing attempt to rise out of bed He GROANS repeatedly

THE BUDWEISER CLOCK --
as its hands spin rapidly around from 815 to 1007

THE DOOR --
as a little KNOCK is heard

WARREN (0S)
Come in

The door opens and Roberta pokes her head in

ROBERTA
Good morning mister sleepy-head

Roberta stops short and is distressed to see --
WARREN

lying improbably on the ground one leg still up on the edge of

the bed

LATER

ROBERTA (CONTD)
Warren whats wrong

WARREN
Oh Im fine Just a little stiff is
all My neck uh I’11 be okay

ROBERTA
Did you fall out of bed

WARREN

(a feeble old-man joke)
I guess it was just a little farther
to the ground than I thought

ROBERTA
Let me help you

WARREN
No I think it’s better if I’mona
hard surface

Warren is back in bed again propped up on several pillows his

head tilted rigidly to one side

He is in great pain

Roberta Jeannie and Randall stand hovering over the patient
Jeannie and Randall are in a hurry -- we can tell from their

jackets ruddy cheeks and how they jangle their keys

JEANNIE
I don’t know it still seems pretty
weird for this to happen today of
all days

WARREN
I’m sorry Jeannie I’m sure I’ll
rally in a few hours The Advil is
kicking in pretty good

JEANNIE
Its just that weve just been really
stressed out the last two weeks
While you’ve been out on your little
trip weve been kind of barely
holding this thing together and now
for you to crap out on us

RANDALL
(good-natured as though
scolding a child)
If you think this is going to make us
cancel the wedding youre sadly

mistaken young man Nice try
Strike two

Did Randall really just say that

WARREN
I just think it’s the bed I need
something firmer

RANDALL
No way That’s an Aquarest 2-9000

Top of the line It‘s definitely not
the bed

WARREN

I don’t know I’m pretty sure I need
a harder surface

RANDALL
Thats a common misperception A
waterbed is the best thing there is
for back and neck support See your
back isn’t straight like a board
It’s more like a long “s Only a
waterbed supports all the natural
contours of your back After all
you spent the first nine months of
your life in water

ROBERTA
Anyway the point is that you Mr
Schmidt have a new job today Your
job is to stay here and rest

JEANNIE
All right Let‘s just deal with
this okay Ive got to get going
Dad where’s the receipt I gave you

WARREN
The receipt

JEANNIE
For the programs At the printers

WARREN

It’s in my breast pocket over there
on the chair

JEANNIE
(retrieving it)

I guess now Randall will have to pick
them up

RANDALL
What do you mean I gotta go to the
airport and get Brian and Dave and
then run them by the tux shop and --

JEANNIE

Well I can’t do it Do you think I
can do it

(meltdown)

I cant do-everything I cannot do 7
everything

ON WARREN --
as Jeannie begins to SOB
excruciating pain

He tries to sit up but winces in
HOURS LATER --

Warren is alone in bed reading ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN This case is a
real puzzler and Warren must turn to the back of the book for the
surprising solution So it was the junk dealer after all

WARREN
By golly

Roberta comes in with a tray of FOOD

ROBERTA
Anybody hungry

WARREN
I could eat a horse

ROBERTA
Chicken noodle soup okay
Wonderful
She sets the tray down next to Warren

ROBERTA
Anything for me in the bedpan

WARREN
(low)
Yes
Roberta now SITS on the bed creating some rough seas

When the

waves calm she places a napkin on Warrens chest and grabs a

spoon and steaming bowl from the tray

WARREN
Oh I can feed myself

ROBERTA
Maybe you can I just think this
might be easier for you

WARREN

(he knows she’s right)
Thank you

Roberta begins feeding Warren spoonful after spoonful
undeniable intimacy informs their conversation

ROBERTA
You know sometimes injuries like
yours are more psychological than
anything else

WARREN
No this is definitely real

“ROBERTA

I don’t mean to imply that youre
imagining your injury It’s just
that sometimes these things can be
brought on by other factors --
stress anger maybe holding onto
some feelings you need to let go of
You might want to look at that

Warren slurps his sogp looks at her

ROBERTA (CONTD)
Youve been through a lot lately

WARREN
It’s the bed I’m telling you I
slept wrong

ROBERTA
You can choose to believe that if you
want to but when I look in your
eyes I see a sad man a very sad
man

An odd but

Warrens expression is one of mild panic Hasn‘t he heard this

somewhere before
oh

WARREN
(affecting a smile)
Oh no Im fine

Roberta catches some soup dribbling down his chin and spoons it
back into his mouth

ROBERTA (CONT’D)
Dont lie to me Jeannie told us all

about your little panic attack last
night

Warren opens his mouth to speak but Roberta pre-empts him with a
mouthful of soup

ROBERTA (CONTD)
And I don’t blame you It’s a
perfectly natural reaction In the
beginning I had my own reservations
After all as the veteran of two
failed marriages I have learned a
lot about what works and does not
work between two people And knowing
what I know and having seen the kids
together much more than you have I
can tell you they are in very good
shape They have a very healthy
relationship -- spiritually
emotionally and physically I’m not
sure how much Jeannie has really told
you about her relationship with
Randall -- I understand she was
closer with her mother But Jeannie
and I have grown very close She
confides in me And well you
already know how famously they get
along as friends But what you may
not know is that their intimate life
is positively white hot

Warren is not happy knowing this

ROBERTA (CONTD)
The principal reason that both my
marriages failed was physical I am
an extremely sexual person I can’t
help it -- that’s just how Im wired
Even when I was a little girl Most
people find this hard to believe but
I had my first orgasm when I was six
In ballet class

MORE

ROBERTA (CONTD)
Anyway suffice it to say I’ve always
been very easily aroused and Jeannie
and I have a lot in common that way
The point is that neither Cliff nor
Larry could keep up with me As much
as I tried to understand it and as
much as I valued the companionship it
became an insurmountable problem Now
I don’t want to betray Jeannie’s
confidence but I can assure you that
she and Randall are not going to run
into those kinds of difficulties
They may have other problems along the
way but they will always have-their— ----
sexual life-to-fall back on- More
soup

WARREN
No I think I’m set

INT RANDALL’S ROOM - DAY

Warren is on his feet awkwardly trying to slip his second arm
into his dress shirt an excruciating task

The door opens and Roberta comes in

She is now very nicely
dressed for the rehearsal

ROBERTA
How are we doing

Unable to turn his head Warren grotesquely pivots his entire body
in order to see Roberta

WARREN
Just dandy A couple more Advil
should do the trick

Warren now raises his chin in order to lift his collar and has a
hideously painful reaction

ROBERTA
I think you need something a little
stronger Give me a second

While she is gone Warren continues the process of trying to put
his tie on The wide end winds up mich longer than the skinny
end but Warren makes the decision to let it go

Roberta comes back in with a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE
ROBERTA
I have these left over from my
hysterectomy They’ve expired but
Im sure they’re okay

WARREN
What is it

Roberta raises the glasses hanging around her neck and examines
the label

During Larry’s speech the camera DOLLIES along a row of attentive

INT ROBERTA’S OLDSHOBILE NIGHT
Roberta drives with a still dopey Warren beside her

ROBERTA
You seem to have come around pretty

good there Warren Youre a changed
man

WARREN
That stuff you gave me -- wow
Youve got to write the name of that
down for me That really does the
trick Boy I tell you

ROBERTA
I know what will really get you out
of the woods As soon as we get
home I’m going to turn on the hot
tub and you are going to take a nice
long soak before bed Youll sleep
like a baby and tomorrow morning
youll begood as new

WARREN
Whatever you say Dr Howzel

EXT ROBERTA’S DECK - WIGHT

Warren is marinating in the sunken HOT TUB

The steam the
bubbles A second-storey WINDOW OPENS

Roberta’s head pops out

ROBERTA
How does it feel

WARREN
Oh this is incredible I had no
idea This is indescribable

ROBERTA

Didn’t I tell you Didn’t I tell
you

The window closes

Warren leans his head back on the rim of the
tub Then --

The patio door opens and Roberta comes FLIP-FLOPPING out in her
robe and sandals

ROBERTA
Mind if I join you

Before Warren can respond Roberta steps out of her sandals and
drops her robe revealing every bit of her glorious NAKED self --

her ample bosom her full abdomen her surgical scars her thick
graying bush

Warren experiences a rush of sudden terror Roberta puts one foot
into the tub
ROBERTA
(a long exhale)
Oooooooohhhhhh Hot hot hot Oh
that’s good

Unsure where to look Warren does his best while Roberta SLOWLY
eases herself into the tub Finally and with much Archimedian
displacement Roberta is up to her neck

ROBERTA (CONT’‘D)
That’s better Ohhhhhhh

Warren looks around to see if there are any nearby hilis he can
run for t

ROBERTA (CONT‘D)
What a night I was very moved I
mean I’ve been so stressed in the
last few weeks that Id sort of lost
sight of the fact that my little boy
is getting married And so is your
little girl You think about it from
the day they’re born and now it’s
here It’s a miracle

WARREN
Yeah it’s pretty amazing all right

ROBERTA
Did you have fun

WARREN
Well Jeannie and Randall seem to
have some very nice friends out here

ROBERTA
yes they do I just wish Larry
would learn not to say everything
that comes into his brain He has no
filter And it’s gotten worse since
he’s been with Saundra

They sit in silence a moment

ROBERTA (CONTD)
Thats what I like about you Warren
You don’t waste words You speak
when you have something to say
That’s very attractive in a man

WARREN
Thank you

ROBERTA
Just think After tomorrow were all
going to be one big family And of
course I’m going to insist that you
consider this your second home I11
set a place for you at the table for
Thanksgiving and Christmas and I won’t
take no for an answer And I don’t know
if Jeannie has told you about this but
we don’t give traditional gifts at
Christmas We make them It can be a
painting or a poem or a song Were a
very creative family One year Randall
made a spoon rack for my spoon
collection And it goes without saying
that you’llhave to come with us to our
time-share up in Breckinridge

WARREN
I don‘t ski

ROBERTA
That‘’s perfect Neither do I It’ll

just be you and me while the kids are
on the slopes

UNDERWATER --

Roberta’s hand travels through the bubbles and comes to rest on
Warren’s knee

WARREN
can barely suppress his panic

ROBERTA (CONTD)
Here we are - a divorcée and a

widower Sounds like a perfect match
to me

Warren suddenly GETS UP and steps out of the tub

ROBERTA (CONT’D)
What are you doing

Warren finds his towel his trunks clinging sadly to his body

WARREN
I need to get to bed

ROBERTA
(genuinely puzzled)
Just like that Come on we were
having such a nice talk
WARREN
I’m all tuckered out Goodnight
Roberta Thanks for everything

Warren turns to go inside

EXT ROBERTAS STREET - WIGHT

Still in his trunks and wrapped in a towel Warren walks barefoot
across Roberta‘s front lawn toward the Bounder

INT BOUNDER - RIGET -

The door opens and Warren climbs up locking the door behind hin
He is not tuckered out as he told Roberta He is wide awake

He pulls a little 8-ounce can of V-8 out of his mini-fridge and
tries to open the irritating peel-off top

IN THE LITTLE BEDROOM --
He gets under the covers

FROM OVERHEAD --

Warren lies awake his eyes wide open CAMERA DESCENDS until we
are very close on his face Sleep is out of the question
WORDS drift into his thoughts --

ROBERTA
It‘ll just be you and me while the
kids are on the slopes

RANDALL
Well if you’d stuck with it a little

longer you would have seen results
Guaranteed

JEANNIE
So you went for the second cheapest
casket the second cheapest casket—
the second cheapest casket

RANDALL
After all you spent the first nine
months of your life in water

ROBERTA
Most people find this hard to
believe but I had my first orgasm
when I was six

unfortunate hat

- Larry walks with Saundra Saundra is unsteady on her heels
Larry has a huge grin on his shiny face

walks Jeannie down the aisle She is nervous and excited and

wears too much make-up Warren has deep deep circles under his
eyes and his neck is still very stiff

We follow them all the way until Warren lifts her veil and kisses
her cheek Jeannie then takes Randall‘s hand as they find their
place before God Warren takes his seat in the front row

DISSOLVE MONTAGE -- A SERIES OF IMPRESSIONS FROM THE WEDDING

Now all the super-imposed images fade away leaving only WARREN
as behind him the wedding guests APPLAUD Fighting his feeling of
overwhelming emptiness he finally applauds too

Randall”
INT HOLIDAY INN BANQUET ROOM - DAY

A CHAMPAGNE FL --
as a FINGER taps it

WIDE -
Warren is gesturing to a WAITER

WARREN
(mouthing)
Could I have some more

Warren is already quite DRUNK and isn’t paying much attention to
the TOAST being given at the DEEJAY BOOTH by best man DENNIS ke

is nervous about his own upcoming toast and he is MAKING NOTES on
a NAPKIN

DENNIS
But Jeannie I just have to share one
last thing I gotta tell you what
Randall told me the morning after your
first night you know that night you
guys met at Corky’s Brewhouse

LARRY
leans over and taps Warren’s shoulder
LARRY
You’re on deck
WARREN
Huh
LARRY

Youre on deck You‘re up next
Warren just nods clearly very nervous

LARRY (CONT’D)
Just say whats in your heart
Warren That’s what I do Say
exactly what’s in your heart

Warren ponders this
WARREN

Yeah That’s what Im going to do
That’s exactly what I’m going to do

DENNIS
continues his toast

DENNIS

He called me up and I could tell
there was something different in his
voice Remember Randy You called
me and you said “Dennis I met this
girl and well this is going to
sound pretty weird coming from mew

(pausing for effect)
but this is one chick I might
actually want to see again”

General knowing laughter Jeannie mock-slaps Randalls shoulder

ssiéssSODEENNIS (CONT‘D)
But seriously It wasn’t a couple
weeks later when we’re out drinking
and scout’s honor were talking
about this and that and suddenly he
turns to me and he goes “Dennis I
think I might be in love’

A general “awwwwwew” Warren remains impassive
DENNIS (CONTD)
And then he told me a bunch of other
stuff I’m not quite at liberty to go
into But what I noticed in his voice
that morning almost two and half years
ago has been confirmed here today You
guys are just a great couple and you
guys really helped me out with that
thing a couple months ago and I‘11
never forget it I love you guys And
I drink to you

(loudly the amp distorting)
Randall and Jeannie forever

He raises his glass and drinks All join in and tap their
silverware on their glasses until Randall and Jeannie smooch

Warren is nauseated by this and emboldened by the resolve to

speak his mind he CRUMPLES the napkin with his notes and casts it
aside

DENNIS (CONT’D)
And now Id like to turn things over
to the proud father of the bride
Warren Schmidt

Amid much applause Warren hesitantly stands and walks to the
microphone He looks down gathers his thoughts There is
expectation in the air Finally --

WARREN
I didn’t get much sleep last night In
fact I didn’t get any sleep at all
So forgive me if I‘ma little foggy

He looks over at --

JEANNIE AND RANDALL

his daughter and his new son-in-law They look back at hin
anxiously awaiting his benediction Jeannie

WARREN
searches his soul for the right words

WARREN (CONTD) 7 —
I was awake all night thinking about
things thinking about a lot of things
But I guess I should have been thinking

more about what I was going to say here
today

Scattered uncomfortable LAUGHTER But Warren doesn’t laugh along
with them He was serious

WARREN (CONT’D)
I was thinking about Jeannie when she
was a little girl and about how sweet
she was how she was everything to
Helen and me And I was thinking about
how sad I was when she moved to
Boulder Of course I supported her
decision to go to college but I guess
somehow in the back of my mind I always
thought she’d land back in Omaha With
her mother and me But it didn’t work
out that way People go their own way
in life And there’s nothing you can
do about it

Warren realizes he’s rambling and tries to focus Those notes he
was making sure would be handy He glances over at where he was
sitting only to see a WAITER clearing the table

The speech that follows is so forced that it’s painful to watch
like a Special Olympics version of a wedding toast

WARREN (CONT’D)
But you know today is a special day
Were here to mark a crossroads in the
lives of two people a crossroads where

they come together and now walk along a
new road

MORE

WARREN (CONTD)
Its not the same road they were each on at
the peginning It’s a new road A
wonderful new road It’s a road that um

He stares at a spot on the floor His body is completely heavy

WARREN (CONTD)

As many of you know I lost my wife
recently and Jeannie lost her mother
Belen and I were married forty-two
years She died very suddenly I know
we all wish she could be with us today
and I think it would be appropriate to id
acknowledge just how pleased she was
that Jeannie had found someone to share
her life with a companion a partner

(the words tasting of metal)
From what I’ve seen Jeannie I‘m betting
you and Randall will have as happy a
marriage as Helen and I did I recall
the day Jeannie first told us she had
been proposed to We hadn’t yet met this
Randall fellow so we were understandably
a little suspicious Later she brought
him home for Christmas so we could get a
look at him I remember there was a big
snowstorm Randall here helped me shovel
off the front walk He pitched right in

Randall beams and nods and jokingly flexes a muscle for the
benefit of the crowd

WARREN (CONTD)

But that brings me to what I really
wanted to say What I want to say is
that uh Thank you to you Randall for
taking such good care of my daughter
especially recently with our loss Ever
since I arrived here on Thursday
afternoon just two days ago I’ve so
enjoyed getting to know Jeannie’s new
family here in Denver

MORE

WARREN (CONTD)

(finally on a roll)
Roberta thank you for your generosity
for opening your home Your talent in
the kitchen Larry your eloquence
Saundra your skill at handicrafts is
truly remarkable -- that item you
showed me was so very very artistic
Duncan I haven’t gotten to know you
very well but I could tell from our
brief conversation Thursday night that
youre a very thoughtful young man
And everybody else Terrific people

(Be’s almost there) —
In conclusionI just want to say that
on this special day this very special
occasion I am proud

Everyone is a little unsure about the moment Was that it Then --

(raising his glass)
Bear hear

Now everyone knows what to do All raise their glasses and drink

dead kind of gets you thinking

EXT PIONEER VILLAGE - DAY

wall impressed by its durability after all these years

WARREN (VO CONTD) te
Were all pretty small in the big
scheme of things and the most you
can hope for is make some kind of
difference But what kind of a
difference have I made What in the
world is better because of me I
have accomplished nothing Even my
trip to Denver was insignificant
compared to the journeys others have
taken to the hardships they endured
the bravery they showed

INTEXT BOUNDER APPROACHING OMAHA - DAY

didn’t work And now she’s married

coward And I’ma failure Theres
no getting around it

INT SCHMIDT HOUSE - DAY

Warren opens his front door pushing extra hard because of the
voluminous MAIL that has been pushed through the door He puts
down a suitcase and stoops to collect the mail

doesn’t matter Once I am dead and
everyone who ever knew me dies too it
will be as though I never existed What
difference has my life made to anyone
