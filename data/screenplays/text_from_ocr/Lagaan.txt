thud scaring the hens But this time instead of collecting the hens he rushes out of the barn towards

In the distance three children hide behind a man about 30 who swings a gofan over his head
with great speed to release yet another stone Bhura ducks as it hits the roof of the barn Bhura is

Champaner is a small farming village in central India As troops pass through the village it is
evident that the presence of the British is not new Arjan - the blacksmith stops for a moment to
look at the troops but continues to strike the hammer on his anvil adding his own rhythm to the
march Ismail - the potter also continues to shape his clay after a momentary pause And so do the
rest of the villagers Ishwar - the vaid and baniya the Mukhiya Shambhukaka - the oldest man

A man intently watches through the dry shrub In the distance a deer pecks at some yellowing
grass The man about 25 earrings in both ears tanned body watches the deer while he gropes
for a stone and takes aim Then he appears to listen for something There is a distant click He
silently counts one-two-three and throws the stone at the deer which makes the deer duck in reflex

Bang A sound of gunfire is heard The deer sprints off A bullet mark appears on the bark of the
tree before which the deer grazed a moment ago After the echoes of the gunfire die down an
English voice roars in disappointment

Goli and Bhura have forgotten their differences and dance together with Goli’s children
Bagha provides an energetic rhythm for the song his eyes constantly on Jigni which Gauri notices

A rhythm so infectious that even Shambhukaka — the oldest man of the vila — cannot resist and

joins the dance Vv

can place his wagers What will you have us do next Race horses

This is the most ridiculous thing Ive ever heard of Captain Russell the British Empire cannot function
according to the whims and fancies of officers like you You jolly well understand that if you win you
will have made a narrow escape But if you lose you will pay the 3 year s for Champaner and
