TITLES OVER BLACK

SUNDAY 814 PM
Strobe light flicker of film through a projector
INT PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT 1

CLOSE on a MOVIE PROJECTOR Light beam blazing through a
viewing window

PAUL the projectionist 40’s Quiet Bookish Sits beside
his projector reading with the aid of a goofy HEADLAMP

The book Don Lincoln’s Quantum Frontier Heavy duty shit

ANGLE ON chapter on about Hadron particle accelerator
Matter and anti-matter

Paul’s lips move quietly He eats this stuff up

Audience LAUGHTER interrupts He stretches Checks his watch

INT THEATER - NEXT MOMENT 2
Paul slips out of the BOOTH into the seating area Glimpse a

FULL HOUSE Faces illuminated by the silver screen
INT LOBBY - SAME 3

Paul weaves through the busy lobby to the CONCESSION COUNTER
Sexy CONCESSION GIRL smiles as Paul approaches She motions
to his head He realizes he’s still wearing his HEADLAMP
Sheepishly slips it off as he steps up

She grins pours Paul a Pepsi He sneaks a look at her She
throws hima sly smile

CONCESSION GIRL
When do I get my private screening

Beat Paul stammers Flirting isn’t his strong suit
PAUL
Those comedies only work with a big

audience You wouldn’t like it

CONCESSION GIRL

The way she says it It’s a come on Paul blanks

PAUL
Uh I --

She smiles gently

CONCESSION GIRL

He looks at her nods She leans in whispering

CONCESSION GIRL
Don’t keep me waiting

And hands him his drink Paul takes it Smiles Starts back
to theater Throws a look back at her She’s smiling at him

Paul turns can’t hide the grin on his face

FOLLOWING Paul back into the THEATER Gales of laughter from
the audience Starts to hustle time for the reel change

INT PROJECTION BOOTH - SAME

Headlamp back on Paul expertly threads the other projector
Takes a sip of Pepsi glancing through the projection window

Waits for it Reaching for the reel change lever -
Sound warbles out Film crawls to a stop
THE BOOTH GOES DARK BLACKOUT

Illuminated by his HEADLAMP Paul steps to FUSE BOX Checks
it All switches are ON

He picks up the HOUSE PHONE It’s dead He glances at the
VIEWING WINDOW No groans from the audience Odd

Only silence And darkness
INT THEATER - NEXT MOMENT

Paul carefully descends BOOTH steps led by the pool of light
from his headlamp

PAUL
Folks we got a little hiccup with
the power --

WHTTF 91609

Turns the corner into GENERAL SEATING
PAUL

Gonna have this moving again

shortly --
Stops staring wide eyed
EVERY SEAT IS EMPTY EVERYONE HAS VANISHED
Soft drinks drain from cups fallen on the floor
And on each seat a pile of clothes watches glasses belts
Below each seat - a pair of shoes

INT LOBBY - NEXT MOMENT

Paul comes out of the theater The beam of his lamp
penetrates the dim lobby

Deserted Silent Small clumps of clothes litter floor The
CONCESSION COUNTER abandoned Money and drinks on the glass

PAUL
June

VOOMP A sudden strike of power Paul jumps Lights kick back
on Video games Beep to life Popcorn machine starts popping

Paul just absorbs it Glances at the concession counter

On the wall behind where JUNE stood he spots them parallel
scrapes in the paint

FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES
CUT TO
INT THEATERMALL - NIGHT
Paul passes through the theater LOBBY into the
MALL ATRIUM

Dim Shops devoid of people Strollers abandoned Shopping
bags crumpled on floor More mounds of clothes

OVERHEAD lights flicker Paul glances at them concerned

VOICE (0OS)
We’re on auxiliary

Paul turns shining light on a young SECURITY GUARD Heading

over with his own flashlight

GUARD
Main power’s out everywhere
(beat)
Got anybody in the theaters

PAUL
Not a soul

GUARD
Same down in the food court

PAUL
What just happened

GUARD

Hell if I know I’m heading up to

corporate to find out

INT MALL WALKWAY - NEXT MOMENT

FOLLOWING them through the eerie half-light FLASHLIGHTS
illuminating darkened shop windows Counters strewn with

money and goods Transactions unfinished

Paul tries his cell Nothing

A SCREAM from deep in the bowels of the place The GUARD

laughs nervously

GUARD
We’re being punk’d right

PAUL
Yeah where’s Alan Funt

GUARD
Who

The HISS of whispering VOICES The Guard spins shoots his

light into a dark FASHION BOUTIQUE

Paul and Guard squint into the murk

THEIR POV - Mannequins frozen in creepy poses Then in the

periphery ashadowy movement

GUARD
Wait here

PAUL
C’mon

Clunk What was that Paul tilts his light back down the
hallway Guard’s spent flashlight spins on the ground

THE GUARD IS GONE
ON PAUL More than confused now Scared

Auxiliary lights flicker Brown out Another MOVEMENT in the
dark store Loud WHISPERS Someone approaching

PAUL (CONT’D)
That you

He shines his dimming LIGHT down there NOTHING
Suddenly the auxiliary lights tap out

In the pitch dark Paul hears a SCREAM From deep in the mall
Then another SCREAM Pure terror Closer

SMASH TO
EXT CITY MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Paul marches urgently from the mall entrance to his car
INT CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Paul keys the ignition It squeals Barely gets it
HEADLIGHTS pop on slice through the dark parking lot

A motorcycle on its side Abandoned shopping carts

Paul scans his radio Static Looks back out his windshield
Sees the long SHADOWS his lights cast onto the pavement

Somehow they are wrong

The shadows seem to be moving independently of the light --

BANG SOMETHING SLAMS ONTO HIS WINDOW
Paul jolts A crazed MAN bashes his fists on the glass
CRAZED MAN
Donde estan los ninos Donde estan
los ninos

He breaks away Bolts out of the headlights into darkness

PAUL
WAIT

Paul throws open the door leaps up Watches as the man
disappears into the shadows -

Then his SCREAM cut short

And silence

Paul slams his door Locks it Guts the stick into drive
EXT CITY MALL PARKING LOT - SAME

Paul’s car tears out of the parking lot

Behind it for the first time we see the blacked out city
scape dark skyscrapers jagged like teeth against the night
sky

INT CAR - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

Paul grips the wheel scanning the dark city streets

HIS POV --

An empty car folded into the side of a building sagging air
bags horn BLARING

A large POODLE sauntering by trailing a leash

An ICE CREAM TRUCK standing idle on the curb headlights
dimming electronic jingle WARBLING in the stillness

EXT CITY STREET - SAME
Paul slows in front of the ICE CREAM TRUCK

In front of the take-out window on the ground Small
sneakers Ice cream cones overturned melting into puddles

INT CAR - SAME
Spooked Paul hits the gas

Up ahead in the dead black he spots a BLINKING red and blue
NEON SIGN “Sonny’s Happy Hour”

A BAR Lit from within An eerie oasis of light in the
darkness

Paul guns the engine

Paul tries the ignition No go Absorbs the silence for a
moment Finally opens the door and climbs out

EXT STREET

Clicks on his HEADLAMP Starts toward the BAR leaving the
cone of the dimming headlights

FOLLOWING PAUL down the dark street

HIS POV - the pool of light skittering across the pavement
Suddenly the light dims Goes out

Paul stops taps the HEADLAMP It’s dead

ANGLE ON Paul’s frozen form sillouetted against the dim
headlights of his car

Then the HEADLIGHTS flare out too

Darkness consumes Paul He takes a small breath Terrified
He glances at the neon sign of the distant bar

A DARK FIGURE seems to grow from the darkness behind him
Paul senses something He whips around

PAUL
Hey -

SMASH TO
INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT
FOLLOWING MAYA 30s Nurse’s uniform Small crucifix dangles
from her neck Her FACE Pretty but worn from a hard life

Scared now No terrified

Small KEYCHAIN FLASHLIGHT in hand Moving urgently down a
long dark corridor Her light bobbing in the darkness

MAYA
Hello Anyone

Get Well BALLOONS drift lazily on the ceiling

( )
WHTTF 91609

A motorized wheelchair Caught in a corner Bumps up against
the tile wall Decatheter tube trailing liquid behind it

Maya rounds a corner passing the NURSERY She pauses Shines
light through an OBSERVATION WINDOW

Rows of incubators All empty

Maya GROANS in dread She starts running

NEXT MOMENT -

She runs around a CORNER Stops At the far end LIGHT leaks
from under a pair of heavy swinging doors The SOUND of
humming machinery

She moves quickly to the light

INT OPERATING ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

Maya cautiously pushes through the heavy doors into the
brightly lit room The beeping and hiss of life support -

MAYA
Someone here

And stops

On a stainless steel OPERATING TABLE glowing under bright
surgery lamps is a PATIENT Suction tubes sputter in the
pooling blood of the gaping hole in his chest

He’s alone The surgery team doctors nurses - gone

Maya presses a hand over her mouth Falls against wall

Patient’s breathing quickens Monitor alarms blare Eyelids
flutter under tape Anesthesia wearing off Opens his mouth

PATIENT
-hurts hurts

Aghast Maya inches towards him How to help

Suddenly everything goes black

Maya SCREAMS drops flashlight It rolls on the floor into a
pool of blood She forces herself to lean over slide it
out Presses against the wall again Trembling aims
flashlight at the OPERATING TABLE

On the table now - a pool of blood and a tangle of tubes

PATIENT VANISHED
A wall of darkness looms around Maya She moans in fear

New sound startles her Scraping She whips around throwing
light on the WALL FINGERNAIL scratches in the plaster

Maya absorbs the inexplicable horror Backs away

Man -- Manny

Starts running hard Smashes through the DOORS

NEXT MOMENT -

Luke letting the liquor do its thing Fumbles something small
from out his pocket Stares at the OBJECT in his palm

We don’t see what it is but it clearly moves him
Luke’s eyes lost in its significance
PEGGY LEE
Then one day he went away and I
thought Id die but I didnt

gingerly takes a seat on a bar stool Kid takes a step back

Luke folds his hands together Stares at the kid in the

LUKE
Youre right I don’t To tell

she’s gone In utter destitution finding the ground Begins
to weep

turns around

THE TUNNEL HE CAME DOWN IS NOW A BLACK VOID

But the darkness is faster

It reaches his feet -

Clunk

His shoes detach from his pants

Stay away from me

The shadow edge climbs up his body His pants legs collapse

He shimmies back darkness consuming him His belt uncoiling
Shirt deflating

Scrambling back leaving his empty pants behind

Stay away

Paul a shrinking torso with arms pushing himself away

Last bulb dieing Shadow sliding up his torso Over his arms -
Clink

His wrist watch dropping on the floor

Shirt sleeves sagging

A head projecting pathetically from sagging clothes

No

He peers into the darkness towering above him In that

As something then shifts His fear gives way To regret
Glances at his wedding band He takes a huge breath

Tearing back towards the church

MOVING WITH JAMES

Down the long stretch of aisle A growing GLOW on his face
JAMES’ POV -

A RING OF BURNING CANDLES behind the alter Like an
enclosure A refuge

ON JAMES

Hope in those eyes Stepping closer -- moving through a cold
patch of darkness

Suddenly spots a FIGURE Hidden in the shadows of the
flickering light Human in scale

JAMES
Mama --

THE FIGURE

Murky Barely broken off from the darkness itself Takes a
chilling step back into it Disappearing

ON JAMES

JAMES
Mama It’s me

Suddenly JUST BEHIND JAMES THE SAME FIGURE

Coming out the black Stretching grotesquely
ITS POV -

Moving behind James About to engulf --

CRASH
The TRUCK smashes through the CHURCH DOORS Splinters fly

Headlights blasting into the place Shadows retreat

James spins squinting in the light Luke sticks his head
out the window Over the engine roar

LUKE
GET IN THE FUCKING TRUCK

JAMES
MY MOM I SAW MY MOM

LUKE
GODDAMN IT THERE’S NO ONE THERE

James turns hurries deeper into the church the darkness

LUKE
JAMES NO

Luke darts out of the truck Truck engine RATTLES

Approaching the alter The candles

LUKE

Racing between the pews

JAMES

Charging up the alter Stops Stares

REVEAL the circle of candles Encompassing food wrappers
debris And a pile of clothing

Something under the clothes A body

JAMES
Mom

James reaches down to pull back clothes --
LUKE

Spins as he hears the dying rattle of truck Headlights
dimming Wall of darkness stenciled around it

JAMES
Pulls back clothes And sees

Nothing There’s nothing there James confused now Scared

Spins to the sound Luke’s stifled SCREAM Echoes into
Silence

ANGLE - Luke’s wedding band spinning on the floor
It stops

James alone now cloaked only in light of candles Darkness
moving in closing in

He swallows a hollow breath

Then

WHISPERING VOICES Growing louder more powerful than ever
James glances every angle Sees -

THE FIGURE IN THE BLACK LOOMING ALL MENACE

A candle flame winks out

FIGURE lurches closer
James stares it down Whispers through his fear

Another candle winks outs threatening

On edge of light SHADOW FIGURE reaching out towards

Standing there Shouting now

JAMES
I’M JAMES I EXIST I EXIST

INCOMPREHENSIBLE VOICES everywhere
James’ SCREAM barely audible over the inhuman ROAR

Another candle winks out -

One left A small throw of quivering flame A draft blows it
Will it go out too
We hold on that suspense And the ROAR --
SUDDENLY CUT SHORT
Everything dead-silent now
And dark as space

140

Rainbow light plays across his closed eyes
Hard breaths Restless dreamstate James opens his eyes

Groggy Blurred focus clears Light shafts play through
colorful STAINED GLASS

CHRIST THE REDEEMER holding aloft a blazing mosaic sun Words
etched in the glass

Go Ye Into All the World

James sits up in the bed of trash surrounded by spent
candles

He looks into the palm of his hand Swollen and red still
clutching Luke’s MONOPOLY CAR

James frozen in the moment Glances up at the bleary dawn
Luke’s promise of another morning

Suddenly the echo of FOOTSTEPS Moving down the aisle
James steels himself Turns around
A small FIGURE approaches One small step after the other

COLORFUL SAINTS frozen images in glass watching with James
As the figure stops

It’s the GIRL

Tattered clothing orange scarf New groceries fill her Dora
Explorer backpack A Teddy Bear tied to her side In her
hand the sturdy FLASHLIGHT

Beat

GIRL
That’s my bed

James reacts Stares at the nest of trash and clothes Back
at GIRL Starts to crawl away

GIRL
You don’t have to go

James pauses Then
GIRL
(quietly)
Don’t go

She approaches sits beside him They sit in silence for a

moment side by side in the cavernous space

GIRL
I’m Briana

JAMES
I’m James

James regards her flashlight

JAMES
It works

Briana nods Shows him the small solar panels
BRIANA

It won’t go out As long as
there’s day It won’t go out

James nods Briana looks at the MONOPOLY CAR he’s holding

BRIANA
What’s that

James looks at it Last vestige of Luke

OFF JAMES remembering Luke’s promise

EXT CITY STREETS - DAWN

James and Briana walk together under a pale sky
buildings loom overhead Candles and other gear stick out

from the pockets and backpacks

They round a bend And stop at the sight of it

A HORSE

Saddled Munching on some grass

A MOUNTED POLICE uniform drags from its saddle
James takes a gentle stop forward

The horse lifts its head

Hoofs slowly CLOP CLOP over asphalt
JAMES straddling the horse Briana clutching his waist
Idle cars trucks dot the highway
Ahead an interstate sign Chicago 280 miles

CLOSE ON THEIR FACES

Scared but determined Knowing they have each other Maybe no
one else

The ride into the daylight ebbing Another day soon gone
And after that
They make their way down the deserted highway
Off the SOUND of clomping hooves
