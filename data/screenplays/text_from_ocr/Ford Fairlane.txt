EXT ENIGMATIC BODY OF WATER - SUNSET

The VIEWERS VIEWPOINT breathlessly GLIDES OVER a body
of water
INT HELICOPTER DRESSING ROOM

BOBBY VOMIT charges through what seems to be a typically-
deliciously-trashed dressing room barking into a phone
headgear apparatus His wire rim glasses amusingly con-
trast with his traditional rock star look of shoulder-
length blond hair and red-tank-top-over-black-spandex
His pacing reveals a helicopter pilot in the bg

flying the dressing room

VOMIT
Wha-at No no I cant do it
tomorrow Im taping a Rock Against
Drugs spot Its important to me

Vomit savagely snorts into a vial of crystal methe
Behind him a big blanket on a couch rises up becoming
a giggling lump

PILOT (0OS)
Five minutes Mister Vomit

VOMIT
Thanks man Dont worry Johnny
I have it with me now Ill just put
it in a little protection program
He cant stop us man no way

Vomit rips off his headgear and looks to a purse on the
couch just as the purses owner a cancer-curing beauty
wearing nothing but an oversize I (picture of a heart)
Black Vomit T-shirt bursts out from under the blanket
sipping from a pink bottle of wine cooler Her name is
ZUZU PETALS

ZUZU
Peek-a-boo

VOMIT
Now Zuzu didnt I tell you to
lay off the coolers

Zuzu giggles away as Vomit slithers down to kiss her
While maneuvering his lips he reaches out to Zuzus
purse

EXT WATER - SUNSET

The VIEWERS VIEWPOINT finally GLIDES PAST the water

OUT OVER a dam where at the base are thousands of
screaming fans A stage has been built atop the dam amid

spooky industrial art design

EXT DAM
The helicopter equipped with a warped logo and the words
BLACK VOMIT swooshes to a halt above the stage where a band
is rabidly pounding away The chopper begins to descend
upon a makeshift backstage area to the side of the stage

CROWD OF THOUSANDS
Vomit Vomit Vomit

INT DRESSING ROOM

Holding Zuzus purse behind his back Bobby Vomit bobs back
up Zuzu takes a dainty sip from her wine cooler babbling
softly in a losing battle with consciousness Vomit opens
the purse and pulls a compact disc from his Spandex The
cover reads Black Vomits Greatest Hits and has a red
number one on it

ZUZU
So I had this dream right You
guys were doing that song I Love
You More Than My Own Death right
when all of a sudden these penguins
come on stage and tell the audience
that I used to wet my bed And
that I enjoyed it It was so real
How bout a kiss Bobby

VOMIT
(closing Zuzus
purse)
Sure Babe

Zuzu drowsily raises her head eyes closed and adorably
puckers up Vomit tosses her purse smack dab into her
face and lips with a bonk Zuzu reacts with a dreamy
smile and curls into a sleeping fetal position

Vomit turns to stare out at his screaming fans and then
down to the backstage area zeroing in on an
eccentrically but stylishly dressed man in sunglasses

EXT BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT (SUN HAS SET)

The man is JULIAN GRENDEL The SOUNDTRACK suddenly ig-
nores the band to go into Grendels mind where elegant
CLASSICAL MUSIC is PLAYING He wryly murmurs to himself
as the reflection on his sunglasses go from the screaming
crowd to the landing chopper

GRENDEL
Vomit Vomit Vomit

The inner CLASSICAL MUSIC CUTS OFF as Bobby Vomit bounds
out from the copter a skipping Zuzu in tow

Vomit and Grendel exchange cold smiles Julian Grendel
is deaf the sound of his speech is perverse in an inter-
esting way

GRENDEL
Nice of you to drop by Mister Vomit

VOMIT
Please dont spank me Mister
Grendel

Vomit pleasantly walks behind Grendel and then wields
around screeching into the back of his bosss head

VOMIT
Drown in hell you deaf
motherfucker

Grendel turns around with a smile

GRENDEL
Sticks and stones

VOMIT
But I thought you couldnt hear

GRENDEL
Oh Robert (Row-bare) youre so
predictable I dont have to

Vomit seethes off to a nearby roadie holding a big drum
of goo flinging off his wire rim glasses

VOMIT
Lets do it man

The roadie begins pouring the goo over Bobbys head
STAGE
The audience explodes in a flurry of cheers as

ANNOUNCER (VO)
Welcome sluts and perverts I
give you Black Vomit

Bobby Vomit strolls onto the stage -- and hes on fire
Covered from head to toe by licking flames -- a heavy
metal human torch

Two Roadies with fire extinguishers fo-o-osh out the
inferno that is the rock stars body Another roadie
tosses him a mike Vomit smolders a bit -- transparent
goo oozing over his body

VOMIT
(calmly)
Hello LA
The crowd riots as the band breaks in with their question-
able but aggressively stated definition of music Bobby
Vomit wails his way through a toxic first verse

He stops singing to spasm to his guitarists solo He
relifts his microphone and uh he chokes making gurgl-
ing sounds as if something were trying to crawl out of
his body

The crowd sounds like all ten thousand of them are in
labor -- they love this

Julian Grendel takes off his sunglasses with a scared
expression

Vomits face turns red as he thrashes about the stage
bashing down amps and barbed wire set design Vomit
Vomit Vomit

The band starts missing notes looking around This
doesnt seem to be part of the act Dribbling a crimson
tide Bobby Vomit falls to his knees with a final scream
of earthly existence A final stream of blood rolls
from his mouth down the white dam to the crowd who has
reached a new level of frenzy beyond the limits of human
comprehension

EXT HOTTEST CLUB IN LOS ANGELES - LATER IN NIGHT

The VIEWERS VIEWPOINT TRACKS DOWN a line of men and
women standing outside the Rolls-Royce of nightclubs
The desperate-to-get-in crowd are dressed-to-kill-be-
killed-and-kill again

At the front of the line the overly rich and gorgeous
thrust and screech over the velvet ropes as a stoic
DOORMAN standing before glass doors uses all the zen
he can to tune them out

DOORMAN
You people are disgusting Dont
you remember the Roman empire

POV - RUCKUS AT DOOR

The Doorman and the frenzied would-be patrons turn TO
the VIEWER and go silent and motionless

INT THE CLUB - AT BAR

Precariously-situated atop barstools are two very short
club owners JAIME and LARRY dressed almost identically
looking out into their club A MAN IN A BLACK HAT
sitting between them turns to sneer

MAN IN HAT
So who the hell is this Ford
Fairlane fuck

JAIME
Guys a rock star who dont play
a note of music Carries a gun
instead of a guitar Am I right
Larry

LARRY
Wasnt always a detective though
Jaime Started out doing every
shit job in the biz chauffeur
roadie publicist Phil Spectors
bodyguard

MAN IN HAT
If I wanted a biography Id eat a
librarian What does he look like

JAIME AND LARRY
Like that

GLASS ENTRANCE DOORS

Handsome and intimidating the VIEWER gets their first
clear view of FORD FAIRLANE as the Doorman swings open
the glass door allowing a classical head-turning entrance
into the state-of-the-art club

FORD
Hey Spike I was sorry to hear
about your cat Those UPS
trucks are pretty wicked

DOORMAN
Thanks man

FORD
If you need somebody to talk to

Ford moves deeper into the club and lights up his
seventieth cig of the day and takes in the la dolce vita
ambience A band rocks out with an attractive
bizarrely-dressed female lead singer A mirthful CLUB
GAL gets a look at Ford and stops laughing She pulls
away from her suitor to slap Ford with a growl

CLUB GAL
You son-of-a-bitch

FORD
Whoa Another satisfied customer

The Club Gal storms back into the arms of her suitor
while Ford wiggles life back into his head

Ford scopes the tables around him His viewpoint halts
at a man with red hair A BOUNCER breaks his
concentration

BOUNCER
Ford I gotta ask you to put that
out dude Nobody smokes anymore

Ford flings his hand down with a quick motion and rubs
at the carpet with his foot The Bouncer smiles and
walks away Ford lifts back up his hand revealing that
the cigarette never left it He takes a drag with a
grin until a hand slaps the cigarette into his face
Its the TWIN SISTER of the Club Gal who slapped him two
minutes ago in a different outfit

TWIN SISTER
What goes for my sister goes
double for me Dont you remember
the Jacuzzi Laurel Canyon the
Guns and Roses video wrap party

FORD
(smiling coming
back to him)
Yeah yeah but you werent
identical

TWIN SISTER
You said youd call us

FORD
Let me give you my number its
555-6023

TWIN SISTER
Thanks Wait 555s not a real
number They only use it in the
movies

Ford slyly walks off holding up his arms to the
decadence around him

FORD
What in the fuck do you think this
is Real life

AT BAR

Jaime Larry and the angry anxious Man in the Hat watch
on

MAN IN HAT
Thats Fairlane He doesnt look
so tough

LARRY

physical response)

DRUNKEN BOY 1

FORD
Go-o-o-d Don

Ford shifts away from the College Boys and into a seat
at the table of DON CLEVELAND a suave and amiable black
record producer

FORD
So many assholes so few bullets

DON
Damn Ford youre the most cynical
man in the industry and thats not
easy

FORD
Im not cynical Can I help it
that life is a disease and
everyones a victim
So youre producing exclusively for
Grendel Records now Hope youre
taking Julian for a bundle

DON
Man ever since old Jack Grendel
died Julian has got me into one
yummy gig after the other Not
only am I producing hes got me
in some lovely-bullshit-money-money
executive position What are you
looking at
Ford is looking off to another man with red hair

FORD
Some redheads been harassing that
all-girl group the Ovaries
Hanging out at their concerts
saying he wants to rape and kill
them and not in that order Cops
wont do anything until he actually
does something

A killer-cute nymph MELODI in a tight-tight dress
bubbles up

MELODI
Youre that guy the private eye

FORD
Youre a poet and didnt know it

MELODI
Do you really know everybody in
the industry

FORD
Only on a first name basis

MELODI
Thats cute Youre funny

FORD
Thats funny youre cute

MELODI

FORD

me to give a shit and stuff

Melodi sweetly hands Ford a napkin with her phone number
on it

MELODI
My names Melodi as in a pretty
girl is like a Whatever youre
doing tomorrow cancel

Melodi winks and walks off Don stares in awe Ford
blows his nose in the napkin

DON
You gotta shave before you leave
the house in a dress like that
and I dont mean your legs Why
didnt you jump on her Whats
happening to you

FORD
I guess Im not interested in any
club wholl have my member as a
member Later Don

Ford scans to Jaime Larry and the Man in the Hat at the
bar

Ford stands and begins weaving between tables He looks
to the attractive singer onstage Seeing Ford she loses
her place in the song She gives off a scowl to Ford and
then continues singing

BAR

Jaime and Larry see Ford approach Larry turns to the
bartender

LARRY
You better have that vodka
milkshake done Here comes Mr
Rock-N-Roll Detec -- Hi Ford

The Bartender nervously pours a blenderful of vanilla
milkshake into an ornate fountain glass and then adds a
huge dose of Absolut along with a maraschino He then
lights the vodka shake afire as Ford reaches the bar
blows it out and slurps

FORD
Not thick enough but better Youre
definitely getting better Harry
(turning to Jaime
and Larry)
Hey if it isnt Mutt and Mutt
Whos your friend

JAIME
Just some guy named Sam

MAN WITH HAT
Yeah Im just some guy named Sam
asswipe

FORD
Reminds me of that song by the all-
girl group the Ovaries Some
Guys Eat Reindeer What A
Tune But whats that lead
singers name Im drawing a
fucking blank here

MAN WITH HAT
(suddenly very
frenetic)
Its Stuh -- Sta -- Sta -- Stac --

As the Man with Hat stutters like the fanatic he is
Ford casually knocks off his hat revealing weird streaks
of red hair Ford smiles turns to the bar and takes a
last sip from his shake before smashing the fountain
glass into the face of the stuttering Sam sending him
off his barstool

The sleazebag leaps up like a wild animal and swings his
fist at Ford Ford grabs onto the flying fist stopping
it dead Sam sharply swings his other fist around but
Ford grabs this one too locking them into an Arthur
Murray lesson position

FORD
Shall we da-ance

Ford heaves the fanatic into a nearby table The fanatic
drops on all fours and crawls under the table A
chuckling Ford strolls between the tables

Sam crawls out from under one table and makes under the
long tablecloth of another The crowd has taken an active
interest but the band continues to play

FORD
So finally got a tip that paid
off Why cant you sleazebags who
harass women take no for an
answer I mean hey its never
happened to me personally

Ford lifts up the tablecloth The sleazebag fanatic is
not there Ford bobs back up with a puzzled expression
and puts a cigarette in his mouth

Ford brings out a lighter as the fanatic suddenly
materializes behind him Sam grabs a huge glass candle
holder from one of the tables and smashes off the end of
it causing a jagged edge The band stops playing as the
CANDLE SIZZLES in Sams hand

SAM THE SLEAZEBAG (MAN WITH HAT)
Last Dance Mr Rock-N-Roll
Detective

FORD
(cigarette falling
from mouth)
Great

Sam the Sleazebag flails the jagged candleholder at Ford
who swerves away and connects with a savage kick to the
groin which Sam enjoys
SAM THE SLEAZEBAG
Thank you

Sam swings out again but this time connects with a
slash to Fords chin Ford is more annoyed than hurt
His solemn anger stops Sam the Sleazebag in his tracks

FORD
Youre ten seconds away from the most
embarrassing moment in your life

Ford launches a powerful uppercut that knocks the
fanatics candleholder-holding hand up into the psychos
own arm Screaming in pain the fanatic flees toward

the dance floor trying to pull out the shards Don pipes
up from a nearby table

DON
Come on Ford this shits getting old

Ford smiles super-swiftly raising his arm A gun slides
out of his sleeve through a sliding Taxi-Driver-style
apparatus into his hand

Ford FIRES up at a discotheque ball rotating above the
dance floor The gunshot breaks the ball out of its
ceiling home and sends it swooshing down right upon the
Sleazebag fanatics head knocking him out cold

Ford turns to the approaching awed twin sisters

FORD
Clint Eastwood I fucked him

The band cranks back up echoing into
INT FORDS LIVING ROOM - DAY

The swank nightclub a memory the VIEWER is now given a
jarring tour of Fords lovable ratty beach house

The VIEWERS VIEWPOINT MOVES UP TO a wall where a set of
curtains mysteriously cover a compartment ACROSS the
wall the VIEWER sees hundreds of autographed photos of
various rock stars pinned to the wall ina
surrealistically haphazard fashion

PULLING OUT A BIT it can be seen that the hellhole is
packed solid with unwrapped VCRs discarded gold records
answering machines remote controls Walkmans Watchmans
cellular phones and all sorts of other basically useless
goodies Each one has a smarmy Thanks Ford-type note
tagged to it

A tremendous music system adorns another wall with a pair
of five-foot tall speakers standing like silent sentinels
Embedded in one of the amplifiers is a wall socket timer
clock -- two needles about to touch The TIMER reading
359 pm WHIRS a bit and then there is a CLICK

WIDE ON MUSIC SYSTEM

The LOUDEST MUSIC in the history of Dolby stereo BALSTS
out of the speakers Dust is literally kicked up as a
rollicking ROCK SONG careens through the room

FORDS BEDROOM

The twin sisters pop up in the bed in various states of
undress their squeals of pain inaudible in the face of
the music The lump in the bed between the twins jerks
spasmodically for a second then calmly rises revealing
itself to be Ford Fairlane still wearing the sliding gun
system on his arm

LIVING ROOM

A ruffled Ford plods in and grabs a pack of cigarettes off
a vibrating speaker He ritualistically lights up and
inhales

Ford pulls back the curtains on the wall revealing a
carved-out compartment in the wall Inside the space is
an obviously old but still in mint condition electric
guitar with a picture of Jimi Hendrix propped next to it
Ford closes his eyes and touches the guitar with a
religious solemnity

Ford pulls the curtains and then bends down to a red
Hotline-looking phone with a quizzical expression on

his face Ford picks up a remote control and zaps OFF the
STEREO revealing that the PHONE is RINGING Ford picks up

FORD
Jesus Jazz Im coming So Im
late I go to work when you go

to bed

Ford hangs up and wearily rises A man who hates his
life

EXT FORDS VENICE HOME

Decked out wrinkled-hip Ford closes the front door of
his charmingly dilapidated home

THE KID a spiky-haired surf punk ragamuffin in a multi-
colored shirt over a Corona T swerves up to Ford on a
skateboard

THE KID
Fairlane you gonna find out who
killed the lead singer of Black
Vomit
FORD
Tell me Dr Watson what makes you
think hes not just another piece
of shit overdose

Ford and The Kid in an obliviously synchronized moment
flick out a pair of sunglasses from their breast pockets
and put them on They then each pull out a cigarette and
with a similar twist of the wrist light it up

THE KID
Gut feeling

FORD
Ill give you a gut feeling you
little Hey hey Get that

stick out of your mouth These
things are killers man Dont
you go to school listen to Smokey
the Bear and all that

Ford tears the cigarette from the Kids mother and starts
to throw it away but instead pockets it They approach
Fords dazzling blue namesake

Ford SQUEAKS off the CAR ALARM with a beeper and then
opens up his unusually modulated trunk Sam the
Sleazebag is seen huddled in a heap within Ford tosses
a smashed-up Twinkie to him and recloses the trunk to
frenzied screams

SAM THE SLEAZEBAG
You sick fuck

FORD
Bone appetit

THE KID
When you going to let me work with
you Why you always fucking with me

FORD
Why am I what Excuse me
(thwacking The Kid)
I catch you saying the F-word
again Ill kill you Thats a
fucking promise Now get the fuck
out of here

Ford gets in his car The Kid boards around to the window

THE KID
I got something serious to dis-cuss

FORD
Well what is it Im not Kreskin
THE KID
Forget it

The Kid rockets off Ford watches with slight concern
then tears off MUSIC BLARING

EXT MINI-MALL DAY

A two-tiered mini-mall nightmare looms ahead The
exquisite eateries of SUZIES SUSHI DONUTS and MUY BURRITO
are sandwiched in on the first level with a tanning salon
and an adult book store

The top tier is not as popular Empty For-Rent spaces
surround a place that has a big plate glass window that
reads FORD FAIRLANE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

INT FORDS OUTER OFFICE - DAY

Ford pushes sleazo through a door into his office

JAZZ Fords secre-uh-assistant sits sharp and stern in
a masculine business outfit and glasses behind a desk
Upon the desks rests a very respectable computer

SAM THE SLEAZEBAG

JAZZ

her desk

With an authoritative silencing cough Ford pulls a huge
pair of hedge clippers from a drawer

FORD
We could gab about evidence and
restraining orders all day but I

to go May get a wee messy

OVARIES and SAM THE SLEAZEBAG
What Ford snaps his shears together with a giddy smile as the
Ovaries move toward Sam fiercely clutching their
burritos

FORD
Its a new by-law for pathetic
jerks who harass women

OVARY FOUR

FORD
Of course Every girl should

Ovary One reaches down OS and pulls down Sams zipper
Ford whooshes down with the clippers and slices Ovary

FORD

A pure white Sam turns and runs into a wall knocking
himself out

FORD

position behind his ranting friend JOHNNY CRUNCH re-

INT FORDS FAIRLANE - NIGHT

Packed with all the perks of his job such as a car
phone and a compact disc player the interior of Fords
Fairlane is pretty jawdropping A FEEBLE WOMANS VOICE
comes through the RADIO

FEEBLE WOMAN (VO)
Johnny why cant you play
different kinds of music

JOHNNY (VO)
I think the real question here
maam is Are you wearing
panties A-a-a-h

The grisly SOUND EFFECT of a woman being sawed in half
by a CHAINSAW comes over the RADIO An exasperated Ford
turns it OFF with a remote control He grumbles toward
the passenger seat

FORD
Why did I take it Because hes
my friend But I never liked the
bastard Why did I say yes Four
thousand reasons Right buddy

The koala bear is revealed to be in the passenger seat
snugly behind a seat belt patiently taking in Fords
complaints

EXT VARIOUS SIZZLING LA SIGHTS

To the chords of a corrosive ROCK-RAP TUNE the VIEWER
and Fords Fairlane GLIDES BY various hot spots such as
the Frolic Room City Restaurant and the Hard Rock Cafe

offstage showing a roadie Zuzus picture

INT BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT

Ford breaks up a game of Lacrosse between some debauched
British rockers and some nubile girls All are wearing
Lacrosse helmets and holding Lacrosse equipment

The nubile girls take off their helmets The girls all
seem to resemble Zuzu but the real thing is not to be
found

INT FORDS FAIRLANE

Ford crosses a name from a list of bars clubs and
concert halls rubber-banded to his visor mumbling to his
koala bear

FORD

A GUNSHOT is heard

JOHNNY (VO)
Oh my god somebody just shot

Ford pulls up to the radio station chuckling at Johnnys
histrionics He turns OFF the RADIO and gets out of
the car
INT RADIO STATION LOBBY

Ford walks into the radio station still smiling at
Johnnys screaming The lights in the radio station
lobby are frantically blinking on and off Putting two
and two together Ford stops smiling He rushes to the
reception desk

FORD

electrocuted

RECEPTIONIST

INT RADIO BOOTH

Ford bursts into the radio booth On the ground with a
bullet in his head is the Engineer Ford crashes through
another set of doors and there SPARKS EXPLODING out of his
face and arms is a sizzling screaming Johnny Crunch

INT RADIO BOOTH - LATER

Cops DETECTIVES and coroner flunkies zip back and forth
with a dazed Ford acting as the eye of the hurricane
gravely contemplating the charred statue that was once
his Brooklyn buddy

DETECTIVE
Well I hope this guy signed your
yearbook because it looks like your
friendship and your case is closed

An assistant pulls a burnt envelope from Johnnys body
filled with charred cash Ford watches in pain

FORD
I think Im going to cry
DETECTIVE
(patting Ford)
Cryings good Ford Cryings good

Commotion outside the booth becomes audible as the flashy
obnoxious LT AMOS makes an entrance He has made a
horrible attempt at dressing stylish His tie is notably
nasty

DETECTIVE AND FORD
Hoh shit

Ford looks away to the side of a console He sees a 45
rpm sleeve It is blank except for some handwriting the
name ART MOONEY followed by a drawn star Ford quickly
nabs it

LT AMOS
Howd Mr Rock n Roll Detective
boogie his way in here Anybody

DETECTIVE
He discovered the body Lt Amos
sir

FORD

Nice tie Lt Anus sir

LT AMOS
You think youre so hot just
because you can get into any club
You think youre so hot just
because you have sex with great-
looking women You think youre
so hot just because you broke the
Ensenada tape piracy ring

FORD
You gotta admit those are all
pretty great reasons

LT AMOS
Get the fuck out of here honey
What do we got

DETECTIVE
This guy was hated by everyone
He offended every race religion
and sexual preference imaginable
He even said the Lakers suck
So basically were looking at
everyone from the Glendale
Skinheads to Magic Johnson

Ford tries to ease out of the booth
LT AMOS
What are you running from

FORD
Why shucks Lt Anus you told
me to get the fuck out of here

LT AMOS
If youre hiding something oh

FORD

A laughing Ford squeezes Lt Amoss shoulder and walks
away

EXT BEACH BEHIND FORDS HOUSE - NIGHT
A smoking Ford stands starkly wailing with his guitar in
cathartic quasi-Hendrixian blasts ruining a perfectly
nice MUSICAL SEGUE ON the SOUNDTRACK

He looks down to picture nailed to the fence before him
of a young Ford and Johnny doing silly rock star poses
Young Ford holds a cheap guitar while Johnny clutches a
pair of drumsticks

Ford presses the cigarette against the photo setting it a-
fire and then resumes his playing The Kid rolls up on
his skateboard holding his ears breaking into Fords solo

THE KID
Ouch

FORD
Hey you get off my cloud Im
talking to my friend 1962 Fender
Stratocaster with original
humbucking pick-ups maple neck
strung upside down for a left-
handed motherfucking genius
Jimi Hendrix

THE KID
Who cares I got a case

FORD
Twelve pack

The Kid holds up a bunch of wadded-up money

THE KID
This aint no social call One
hundred bucks To find my father

FORD
(looking up to God)
Did he just say what I think he
said

THE KID
Ive got a clue Look at my ring
Before my old lady ran off to
Baja she told me my dad had this
same ring

The Kid holds out his hand A ring of Snoopy in his
fighter pilot outfit is attached to his hand A couple
of notes of Snoopy and the Red Baron play on the
soundtrack

FORD
Holy Colonel Mustard Gosh you

Kid I cant take your money
THE KID

FORD
I dont need it that bad

INT FORDS PLACE - NEXT DAY

Ford snores away on his couch holding his guitar The
koala bear sleeps beside him The DOORBELL RINGS And
AGAIN Fords eyes pop open to a pile of wadded up
money on his coffee table

FORD
I dont believe it I took the
money

He meanders to the door like a Cocoon II cast member and
opens the door COLLEEN SUTTON stands in a striking pose
at the door Behind her in the street is a blue limousine
and a driver

The very attractive Colleen belongs to the genre of rich
people that has seen it all every piece of decadence
perpetuated Nothing fazes her even the chilling sight
of a just-woke-up Ford

COLLEEN
Ford Fairlane Im Colleen Sutton

problem and it pertains to the
music industry What is it they
call you Mr Rock and

FORD
Dont say it Orange juice

COLLEEN

Ford takes a carton of orange juice from the coffee table
He shakes it and then pours into a pretty used-looking
glass also from the coffee table He hands it to the
deadpan Colleen

FORD
Sorry about the glass And the
house And the breath

COLLEEN
Mr Fairlane Im very rich The
kind of rich that warps minds
Nothing offends me When I was
eleven I walked in on my father
and the Shetland pony he had
given me for my tenth birthday
Does that excite you

FORD
I dont know I never met your
father

Colleen looks down to Fords crotch Ford does the
same and then raises his head with a laugh

FORD

Oh that Dont take it personally

COLLEEN

Incredibly LOUD MUSIC BLASTS through the room Colleen
splashes orange juice all over herself undulating in a
wacky Martin Shortesque double take Ford remotes off
his alarm Colleen regains her composure with a big
orange juice stain

They sit upon the couch the dozing koala between them

FORD
Now that weve broken the ice

COLLEEN
I need you to find my little sister
She goes by the name Zuzu

FORD
Zuzu Petals You want me to
rescue her from the gorgeous hell

Colleen holds out the picture of Zuzu blowing a kiss

FORD
No thanks I carry my own

COLLEEN
Excuse me

FORD
Lets see youre her worried
sister Yesterday I met her
worried father who incidentally was
about five years younger than you
In fact I capped off the evening
by watching him get electrocuted
They talk about cases like this in
the private eye handbook
something about a ten-foot pole

Speechless Colleen pulls out a thick envelope

COLLEEN
Five thousand should be enough
to assuage any qualms you have
about my family tree

FORD
Yeah but of course for now
I only get a twenty

COLLEEN
Actually you may take it all now

FORD
Oh I have some questions

COLLEEN
I have no answers Thanks for the
stain Find the girl In the

Art Mooneys name and the star on it

Mooney the other night

INT MIXING BOOTH - LATE AFTERNOON
Don Cleveland the suave black producer from the club sits
behind a large mixing board along with engineers and mixers
A passable tune with ghoulish VOCALS is FILTERED into the
booth As Don speaks Ford stands behind him staring
through the glass at the source of the wretched music

DON
I havent seen her around and as
for who would want to kill Johnny
Crunch line forms to the left
Youd find less people on our
planet who wanted him alive

FORD
(in a trance
to the glass)
Great pipes

INT RECORDING STUDIO
Don laughs as the viewer gets a look at KYLE TROY a
very young pretty-boy whose non-singing is matched by

his non-guitar-playing ability

A number of studio musicians valiantly try to make some-
thing out of the song theyre playing

INT MIXING BOOTH

FORD
Ive heard cars fuck with more
harmony

intriguing idea

Everyone face drops Behind Ford stands the charis-
matic JULIAN GRENDEL Julian laughs allowing the others
to do so He shakes Fords hand motioning to the

mixing booth window

GRENDEL
Good to meet you Mr Fairlane

Grendel mimics a vivid but silent belly-laugh Ford
chuckles

FORD

GRENDEL

(with a laugh)
I never knew what a blessing my
accident was until he died and I

DON
Julians happy as long as he

FORD
(motioning to the
yelping Kyle)
I never thought Id be jealous of

snap snap -- Kyle Troy frowns -- snap snap -- a couple

of the band members nod

Spare time on the back

The bass player jumps in -- BUM BUM

Kyle pouts -- the drummer kicks in

FORD

The rhythm guitarist and keyboardist join the jam The

boys in the booth are bopping their heads to the beat

FORD
I gotta a pocket full of crumpled
bills
I gotta stomach full of different
pills

The band suddenly kicks into a rousing instrumental
break of Calvin Carters I Aint Got You Ford gets
wicked with the mike stand

FORD

Don cracks up as Ford makes his exit
INT HALLWAYS OUTSIDE STUDIO

A pleased-with-himself Ford bounds from his studio He
comes across an eerie sight in the hallway -- Two men in
GUNSLINGER coats over Armani suits One is a black mohawked
PUNK and the other is a highhairheaded HEAVY METALER

FORD
You guys part of a band

PUNK GUNSLINGER
(contemptuously amused)
» Sure Our name is Pain

Ford fakes a smile The duo snort and sneer as he walks
off

EXT GLOOMY MARINA - NIGHT

Fords Fairlane pulls up before a pretty ominous marina
Boars are eerily moored with no sign of human beings

EXT PIER - NIGHT

Ford creeps across the pier He puts the finishing
touches on his arm-to-hand sliding gun apparatus before
looking to a nice-sized but inherently tacky boat from
which an eerie ROCK SONG spookily emits The bow reads
THE MIGHTY PENIS

FORD
I wonder which boats Johnnys

EXT DECK OF MIGHTY PENIS - NIGHT

Ford comes onto the deck of Mighty Penis He glances
around before descending below to follow the siren call
of the eerie MUSIC

INT CABIN

Ford comes down and turns on some bizarrely hued lights
revealing a literally rocking bachelor pad from hell com-
plete with a scary rack of dildos and an inflatable doll
that floats above a neon ME sign Ford goes past a wall
that has cut out quasi-nude shots of breasts and buttocks
FORD
The love boat is making another
run

He then makes a glance to another picture on the wall
It is the same young-and-wanna-be-rock-stars picture
of Johnny and Ford that Ford viewed earlier

Ford sadly blinks before looking to a gun rack on the
wall that holds three shotguns Ford wobbles over to
an entertainment system set up next to the rack He
turns OFF the eerie rocker on the STEREO A video
cassette marked Collie and Me lies on an adjoining
VCR Ford puts the tape in

TAPE

The TAPE WHIRS on to show Johnny kneeling on his heart-
shaped bed in a comical schoolboy outfit and a dunce cap

JOHNNY (VO)
(on video)
Wheres my Queen Collie I need
some order

Colleen Sutton comes on the screen in killer black lin-
gerie and wearing a paper Burger King crown She steps
threateningly toward the bed carrying a scepter

COLLEEN (VO)
(on video)
Queen Collie is here

INT CABIN
Ford snaps OFF the TV

FORD
This is why I have cable

Ford steps over to a closet and opens the door And
theres a smiling guy in a psychedelic tie-dye shirt
standing inside Ford quickly closes the door -- and
BAM -- a hand crashes through the door and latches on to
Fords neck Ford beats off the arm

Ka-blam The smiling guy kicks the door off its hinges
Meet SMILEY Hes muscular and seems mean despite the
fact he has a ponytail wears sandals nice black gloves
and has a damn smile that never ever leaves his face

SMILEY
Hows it going

Smileys fist swooshes at Fords head Fords hand whips
out of nowhere and grabs the fist in midair
FORD
Youre ten seconds away from the
most embarrass -—

Crunch Smiley punches Ford across the jaw with his left jaw

Fords body careens into a dresser He bolts up and as
he did so wow-ly in his opening scene super-swiftly raises
his arm Only this time the gun doesnt slide out

Ford feebly tries to reach in his sleeve to retrieve the
gun but crack Smiley strikes again Ford runs to the
gun rack and tries to pull out a shotgun but it is locked
Panicked Ford yanks the entire gun rack off the wall as
Smiley latches on with a nasty bear hug Ford FIRES off a
wild BLAST from one of the still-in-the-rack GUNS

The shotgun blast demolishes a Playboy centerfold and
causes a BLAST of WATER to whoosh out from her remains

Smiley moves into a strangling mode while Fords hands
move down to the next gun on the rack Another BLAST
BURSTS a hole in the other WALL

Ford FIRES OFF yet another one into the floor below him
causing a devastating geyser that allows him to break
away from Smiley

Water is amusingly blasting out from every angle Ford
and Smiley battle semi-obliviously to this new added
element of nature The water rises above their knees

Ford spins around and grabs the TV off the still-standing
home entertainment center He SMASHES it upon Smileys
head submerging him into the water which is now at
Fords waist Ford frantically scans the water like a
shark attack victim but Smiley does not emerge

FORD
Marco

Ford quickly wades to the stairs

EXT MIGHTY PENIS

is sinking pretty fast

EXT DECK

Ford collapses onto the damp deck with a gasp The
entire lower level of the boat is underwater Ford works
himself into a standing position as Smiley ferociously

resurrects from out of decktop windowcase

SMILEY
Polo
FORD
Whatever youre getting paid I
can give you twenty maybe thirty
bucks more

Smiley does a savage medley of punches across Fords
gut before slapping him into the deck rail WATER
SPLASHES onto the deck as the boat goes into death
throes Ford ungracefully makes a clinging jump onto

FLY BRIDGE

Ford beaches himself on the tippy top of the boat
Smiley effortlessly pops up and moves around behind
Fords head

FORD
Had enough

Smiley laughs as he places his thumb behind Fords earlobe
at Fords jawline This hurts The fly bridge is the
only part of the boat above water

SMILEY
Feel my thumb I keep it there
forty seconds more and a welt
develops cutting off the oxygen
to your brain I leave MTwenty-
one minutes later youre dead
The slowest most painful minutes
a person can experience

FORD
I guess you never saw A Very
Brady Christmas

SMILEY
(squeezing tighter)
Case closed okay Thirty seconds

FORD
Fine

SMILEY
Whats fine

FORD
Im off it

SMILEY

Off what Twenty seconds

FORD
The case

SMILEY
Oh One more thing This is
personal I want you to tell me
youre a big sissy

FORD
I Am The Biggest Sissy
In The Whole Fucking World

Smiley removes his thumb pats Ford on the head and then
proceeds to exuberantly backstroke away A job well done

Fords torso is the only thing above water His sliding
gun apparatus pings to life The gun finally slides into
his hand Ford snorts and shakes his head as he dis-
appears below the water

INT DOROTHY CHANDLER PAVILION LOBBY - NIGHT

The elite of Los Angeles with impeccable tuxedoes and
gowns to prove it grandly stream into a large
auditorium

Ford holding a plastic bag of party ice over his face
stumbles through the pavilion doors in a wrinkled tuxedo
The ice bag breaks sending ice and water down Fords
shirt Various snooty patrons turn to harrumph includ-
ing Colleen who does a double take when she realizes who
she is harrumphing at

COLLEEN
My God Mr Fairlane you look

FORD
Colleen and Johnny sitting ina

COLLEEN

A couple of gasps rise up out of the patrons around them
Ford and Colleen feel the breeze of heads turning all
around them They turn to see what everybody is looking
at

What they are looking at is Jazz Gone are her glasses
and businesslike dress She stands at the inside
entrance of the pavilion in a tight low-at-the-top-
high-at-the-bottom black leather mini-dress

FORD
(catching his
breath)
Excuse me

Jazz squints at the crowd trying to find Ford who is
quickly coming right towards her

veers down the hall into the ladies room

From a seated position at the other end of the hall Jazz
frenetically pops up and pushes on her glasses She clacks
after Colleen into the ladies room as well

INT DOROTHY CHANDLER PAVILION LOBBY

Balletgoers stream into the lobby for the post-ballet re-
ception Ford meanders out with the buzzing crowd a
couple patrons taking notice of his wrinkled attire Ford
blazes a Marlboro Gold as a SNOOTY NON-SMOKER who got a
snide closeup earlier in the segment points to a Yes I
mind if you smoke button on his lapel

SNOOTY NON-SMOKER

Can you read smoker

FORD
Can you whistle Man in the Mirror
out your ass snapperhead

SNOOTY NON-SMOKER
Hey dont be a pottymouth I

As Ford speaks he takes a rubberband and attaches it to
a lighter in a way that keeps the flame lit He then
places it in the Non-Smokers tuxedo pocket
FORD
You know youre right sir and
Im sorry I thought I lived ina
country where you were free to do
any stupid thing you wanted drive
to work naked make love to a
VCR but hey you reminded me I

you can stab me in the heart with
these things called opinions just
because you have them

The Non-Smoker weakly smiles his jacket starting to smoke

SNOOTY NON-SMOKER
Its okay Its okay guy Smoke all
you want Here have one of mine

The Non-Smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes from his
literally smoking jacket and then bolts away

An hors doeuvres tray cruises by Ford grabs something
on a toothpick and casually shoves possibly the worst
thing hes ever tasted in his life into his mouth Ford
doesnt chew -- he just looks around for someplace to
spit it out just as Julian Grendel approaches

GRENDEL
Well hello Ford

FORD
Mmmmmmm Mmmm mmm

GRENDEL
I must say youre an island of
reality in an ocean of diarrhea

Jazz excitedly approaches Ford and Grendel Ford grabs
her and deeply kisses her Ford pulls back and addresses
Jack in his normal voice Meanwhile Jazzs face turns
color her mouth trying to deal with the most disgusting
transferal of an hors doeuvre in film history

FORD
And its good to see you Julian
This is my assistant Jazz

JAZZ
Mmmmmmm Mmmm mmm

GRENDEL
So what did you think of the ballet

Jazz swallows her eyes bulging with delicate agony

FORD

child prahdigies who was writing
baroque operas while the other kids

murders Forget it man

Ford and Jazz stroll to their respective cars parked
side-by-side Jazz drives a black Volkswagen bug

FORD
Oh Hey how about that hors

Jazz cackles and gets in her car Ford watches her go

INT FORDS HOUSE - LATE THAT NIGHT

In his underwear Ford vegges on his couch with a koala
bear at his feet and with a BLENDER WHIRRING beside

FORD
Why didnt I pick fishermen

Ford STOPS the BLENDER flips off the lid and begins
drinking his homemade vodka milkshake straight out of
the blender but only after setting it on fire and
blowing it out
Ford then lazily remotes ON the TELEVISION MTV News
with KURT LODER finishes up Ford unslumps up with
Kurts revelations

KURT LODER (VO)

(on TV)
Police are now saying Bobby Vomit was
not the victim of an overdose as first
suspected but was actually poisoned
Police have no suspects yet and have
asked all Black Vomit fans not to show
up at the funeral which by the way
will be held at the Hollywood Cemetery
at midnight In homage heres the
last video of Bobby Vomit

Ford mouths wow to himself as the rock video begins
VIDEO

A lacerating TUNE BLASTS forth with Bobby Vomit writhing
around a cage Inside the cafe is a beautifully modulated
babe with monster makeup all over her face The rest of
Black Vomit dutifully play their instruments at the back
of the set all wearing doctor uniforms

Vomit pulls the babes monster-faced head out from between
the bars of the cage He savagely kisses her and then
runs to the door of the cage He flings it open The
babe no longer has the face of a monster She has the
face of Zuzu Petals for that is who the babe is

INT FORDS ROOM

Ford does a vodka milkshake spit-take

VIDEO

In closeup Zuzu blows the VIEWER a kiss

EXT HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY GATE - NIGHT

WITH Spotlights with T-shirt hawkers and with a couple
hundred mournful rock and roll fans pushing and shoving
at the gate the viewer believes they are at a concert
not a funeral

A hurriedly dressed Ford tucking his shirt in approaches
the gate He focuses upon a SLEAZY GUY doing something

with two girls

SLEAZY GUY
Thats one hundred Each

The two girls nod -- Sleazy Guy hands them something --
the girls leave
Ford approaches as the Sleazy Guy carefully calls out

SLEAZY GUY
Got those Vomit invites here

FORD
Scalping to a funeral youre a
pretty sleazy guy

SLEAZY GUY
Thanks You interested Its
festival seating so

FORD
How much

SLEAZY GUY
Three hundred

FORD

You gave it to the girls for one

SLEAZY GUY
Hey they blew me

FORD
Oh Three hundred coming right up

Ford very quickly hands over three hundred dollars
EXT FUNERAL GROUNDS

Ford mounts a small hill to blend into the already-in-
progress funeral Many people stand in various not
necessarily tasteful black clothes A row of nubile
mournettes kneel praying the lipstick on their face is
noticeably and obscenely askew

FORD
Geez am I the only one who paid
full price here

A priest stands next to a big empty hole The band
members of Black Vomit are situated behind it with
their instruments They begin a mournful metal jam

The sound of a HELICOPTER is heard Everyone seems to
be ignoring this fact but Ford A chopper is cruising
toward the funeral

The CHOPPER sounds get LOUDER as the helicopter positions
itself over the open grave The band increases its
intensify as the crowd chants Vomit Vomit Vomit A
large transparent tube is pushed out of the helicopter
with an attached black parachute The tube is lit up

by round dressing room-style bulbs
The tube floats down toward the grave Ford and the
VIEWER get to see that in the lit tube is Bobby Vomit
It swooshes perfectly into the grave

Ford shakes his head in amazement Getting serious he
pulls the picture of Zuzu Petals from his pocket and
scans the crowd More young pretty girls in sexy black
pass before the grave but no Zuzu

A GIRL IN A BLACK VEIL (three guesses who) quietly sobs
beside Ford holding the black purse from the opening
scene (okay one guess who) With a whimper she puts
her head against Fords stomach By reflex Ford puts
his arm around to comfort but his eyes never leave the
crowd

GIRL IN VEIL
He was so good

FORD
Yeah he was one of the greats
(holding out the
photo)
Hey you havent seen this girl
have you

GIRL IN VEIL
Is this a trick question

The Girl In her Veil lifts her veil It is Zuzu Petals
Ford goes insane with victory

FORD
Zuzu Petals Zuzu Petals Yes
Who killed Bobby Vomit Who
killed Johnny Crunch Why do
people want you so goddamn bad

ZUZU
I dont know Im so scared
Help me

Zuzu drops to her knees before Ford

FORD
A simple please would suffice

ZUZU
Fluck you

Zuzu fiercely balls her fist and punches Ford in the
groin She then bolts up and starts sprinting away
Ford gasps after her

FORD
Fluck me
Zuzu keeps running She gives a glance back toward Ford
as a black gloved hand thrusts out and grabs her by the
neck The arm leads to the maliciously chipper face of
Smiley

Smiley lifts Zuzu up and heaves her into a sidecar
connected to a state of the art motorcycle Witha
painful crash Zuzu lands upside-down in the sidecar
Smiley straddles the BIKE and ROCKETS off recklessly
weaving through tombstones

Panting Ford stops running toward the motorcycle He
changes direction and begins running

until he reaches his Fairlane Ford wails in anger for
his tires have been punctured The PHONE in his car
suddenly RINGS Ford reaches in and pulls out the
portable phone

FORD
K-O-D-S is going to make me rich

MOTORCYCLE
Smiley is revealed to be barking on a cellular phone
attached to his motorcycle while burrowing through the
tombstones Zuzus legs flail from out of the sidecar
SMILEY
Hows it going Radio station

The super-bike sends frightened mourners into empty burial
holes

ANOTHER PART OF CEMETERY GROUNDS

Portable phone pushed up under his armpit receiver be-
tween his head and his shoulder Ford barrels up a hill

FORD

If you hurt her Ill kill you

Maybe not personally but Ill

think of something
At the top of the hill is a parked hearse
HEARSE
Two slimy MORTICIANS come out from the back of the
hearse They are each smoking a cigarette and zipping

up their pants

MORTICIAN ONE
Some days its great to be alive

Ford charges into the front seat of the hearse He
turns the ignition key and tears off

MORTICIAN TWO
Hey he took Lydia

MORTICIAN ONE
(giving his zipper
a final yank)
So what weve had our fun

INT HEARSE

The body of a VOLUPTUOUS WOMAN rests naked on a gurney
in the back of the hearse The gurney wobbles back and
forth toward Ford in the drivers seat A tag on her
hand reads LYDIA

FORD

Smileyhead

MOTORCYCLE

Smiley blazes across the gravesite green towards the
entrance A discombobulated Zuzu twists into a sitting
position

SMILEY
Normally Id be up for a bullshit
car chase but I got to get up early

Smiley looks down to his phone with a quizzical ex-
pression In the bg the hearse can be seen barrelling
over a hill

SMILEY
Ford where did you go Dont be

HEARSE

Ford intensely weaves through burial paths His point of
view has the motorcycle getting closer

MOTORCYCLE AT CEMETERY ENTRANCE

Smiley hangs up the phone and ROARS into the street out-
side the cemetery Zuzu scowls until Ford pulls up
beside them shouting out his window

FORD
You were saying snapperhead Ill
bet youre not smiling now

SMILEY
Oh but I am Dianetics Ford You
should try it

FORD
Say cheese

Ford super-swiftly raises his arm activating the sliding
gun apparatus The gun sails out of his sleeve past his
hand out of his car and over Smiley who rightfully laughs

SMILEY
Thanks but I have my own

Smiley pulls a serious GUN from his coat and BLASTS away
Ford steers off as the BULLETS shower into his hood

ZUZU
(regarding Ford amused)
My hero

The HEARSE convulses in a mind-roasting SKID causing the
other poor cars in the vicinity to insanely slam into
lampposts mini-malls and themselves

HEARSE

All this motion commotion causes the body of the Vol-
uptuous Woman to burst out from the back and to crash
into the front seat Ford shrieks at the inert well-
endowed flesh Suddenly the PHONE RINGS Ford fren-
etically picks up

FORD
Fuck you man I cant talk
Mom What are you calling for
No no I dont always answer the
phone like that Its business

The naked body bounces and bashes against Ford as he
speaks The voluptuous head slams down onto Fords lap

FORD

waiting)
Sorry it was my mom

position and pulling over a seat belt He shouts in
the phone

FORD

Ford hangs up letting go of the seat belt Ford watches
the bodys ludicrously bouncing breasts

FORD
Damn baby I hope you filled out
some organ donor cards

Ford looks out the windshield and howls
INCREDIBLY INCLINED STREET

The hearse slams into the base of the very steep hill
it rockets upward

The dead body flips and flops over into the back seat

The hearse flies over the hill and whizzes forward
approaching Smileys motorcycle Ford pulls up beside
Zuzu in the sidecar

FORD
Zuzu Petals Im Ford Fairlane
Im the good guy hes the bad guy

Entertained Smiley FIRES his GUN at the hearse Ford
swerves around behind the motorcycle to Smileys side

Zuzu loops her purse around her neck and then with a
devilish grin she stands up in the sidecar Smiley
watches incredulously as Zuzu jumps from the sidecar onto
the motorcycle between his legs and then after blowing a
kiss into the open passenger window of the hearse

A disoriented Smiley swerves off onto a sidewalk zipping
past freaked out pedestrians

HEARSE
Zuzu lands onto the passenger seat with a giggle

ZUZU
This is so amazing A car chase
Lets get on some car chase music
Ra-a-w-wk

Zuzu turns ON the RADIO and turns it UP LOUD Ford can
only stare at this perverse girl in amazement Zuzu
looks over to him popping a bubblegum bubble

bodybag is carried through the tables past a melancholy
Ford who sits contemplating shot black rose petals

howls

UNPOOR FRAT BOY DRIVER
Du-udes they executed my Midget

The Frat Boys thunder towards the Jeep The Punk
Gunslinger exhales a This aint my night breath before
pulling out an UZI He SPRAYS a line of cars parked
before the fraternity SHATTERING WINDOWS setting off
CAR ALARMS and sending scared Frat Boys running away
squealing

POLICE SIRENS can be heard in the distance

PUNK GUNSLINGER
Its cut-our-losses time dude

The JEEP starts to SCREECH off but then stops and backs
up so the Heavy Metal Gunslinger can lob a GRENADE into
the sports car

The Unpoor Frat Boy Driver watches in agony as his CAR
EXPLODES Ford comes up from behind him takes the Boys
hand and extends the thumb Ford grins

SORORITY

A victorious Ford struts into the sorority to much
applause Ford looks down to a box of water balloons and
pulls out one with each hand High-energy MUSIC is
playing on the STEREO
FORD
All work and no play makes Ford
a dull boy

SORORITY SISTER ONE
Water balloon fight

MELODI
Sisters dont get your robes wet

The Sorority Sisters all start to yank off their robes when
suddenly a crumpled and bloodied Jazz enters the house

JAZZ
Why do we have to have an office
on the second floor

Jazz begins to collapse Ford drops his water balloons
and catches her

JAZZ
I came to warn you

FORD
Oh Jazz those bastards call
an ambulance Get that music off

ZUZU
Sure I have a much more appropriate
CD Bobby sneaked it into my purse
the day he died It was so romantic

Zuzu pulls out the red number one Black Vomit CD from
her purse She goes to the compact disc player and
slides it in

The painful COMPUTER SCREECHES SCRE-E-E-E BUZZ
SHSHSHSHSHSH come croaking out the SPEAKERS The
Sorority Sisters hold their ears whimpering in pain
while Zuzu obliviously tries to dance to it Ford and
Jazz smile at each other

MELODI
This isnt music

FORD
It is to us Its computerised

Jazz takes the Black Vomit compact disc case (with a red
number on it) from Jazz and holds it up

JAZZ
I believe the last time we came
across one of these was at the
ballet What were your words
(in Fords gruff
facetious tone)
A fucking CD This case is
closed

FORD
(smiling)
Ive always said the one reason
Im the best detective in the
industry is that Im the only
one but hey I never throw away
a clue

Ford triumphantly pulls the small toy duck from his
pocket He frowns and throws it away then pulls out
Colleens CD

FORD
Sisters the sorority computer

ANOTHER CORNER OF SORORITY HOUSE - LATER

The entire sorority and Zuzu are huddled around a seated
Ford and slightly-cleaned-up Jazz who is banging away at
a computer

FORD
Aha just what I suspected

JAZZ
Youre not funny

The computer screen is filled with incomprehensible
scrambled nonsense

ZUZU
This is boring guys

FORD
Zuzu be quiet Put in Colleens
disc Number two

Jazz slides Colleens disc in the CD modem More
scrambled nonsense of a different kind appears on the
screen

ALL GIRLS
Bor-ring

FORD
Hey

JAZZ

Hmmm the first disc was putting

out an incomprehensible stream of
high bits This one is putting out
low bits The data is in some fucked
binary system The two discs need

to interface simultaneously with a
third decryptor disc Comprendo

FORD

Su-ure Two people hired me to
find Zuzu in order to get hold of
one of those discs and Colleen threw
a tizz when we took hers Obviously
all this binary disc shit is pretty
mighty

(standing up)
But its not necessary People
are dead One was a friend The
same people were involved ina
scam to rip off Grendel Records
Bottom lines Julian Grendel is
doing a little revenge number

SORORITY SISTER 1
Youre making quite a jump

SORORITY SISTER 2
Do you have any proof

SORORITY SISTER 3
You cant just go up to Julian
Grendel and say

Ford cuts them off with a deadpan blink

FORD
Jazz get to a hospital Zuzu and
I are going to feel things out with
Mr Grendel If I dont call in
an hour hell I dont know

INT JULIAN GRENDELS OFFICE - NIGHT

Bizarrely-over-the-top-high-tech Strange furniture --
gold records -- the spooky portrait of Julian and his
father A nighttime cityscape sparkles through the
windows Awnings meant for sunlight jut out and block
moonlight

Bathed by high-tech lighting wearing a tuxedo Julian
Grendel is pounding a feverishly-modulated CLASSICAL
TUNE on a piano

When the VIEWER TAKES IN the sight of a confused Ford
and Zuzu standing off to the side the latter blowing
gum bubbles it is REVEALED that Julians piano is
literally soundless The piano has had all its chords
ripped out The classical piece existed only in Julians
brain and on the soundtrack Julians actual playing
produces only a dull clicking sound

FORD
Uh nice piano Probably get a
lot of complaints from the

neighbors -- heh Its another
time Julian another place If I
told you Bobby Vomit Johnny Crunch
and Colleen Sutton were the ones

you were complaining about the ones
who tried to rip you off what
would your reaction be

GRENDEL
(wry)
Shock

FORD
And if I told you that you already
knew all that shit and that you
had them killed what would you do
then

GRENDEL
Golly Id probably faint

Suddenly Smiley smiling in another tie-dye shirt non-
chalantly walks into the room carrying a couple shirts
in cleaners bags in his black-gloved hands

ZUZU
Uh-oh

SMILEY
Bro they still cant get that
spot out

Grendel downs Ford with a punch to the gut and tears the
CDs from Fords pocket Smiley laughs and whimsically
shakes his head

ZUZU
Ford you were right

FORD
Ye-ah

Julian picks up a remote control and zaps a STEREO A
dramatic CLASSICAL PIECE floats on He then coolly pops
open the drawers of three CD modems beneath a large
computer screen He plunks a disc in each

GRENDEL
Actually youre a bit off in the
motivation department I mean
revenge is so Bronson

(furious coming

to the third modem)
Wait wheres the third CD How
could you come here without proof
Its a three piece set here A
computer disc from Colleen Bobbys
computer disc and Johnnys computer
disc Together they make oh
fucking forget it

FORD
Yeah yeah I know the third one
unscrambles the high bits and the
low bits Shit just start torturing
me man I didnt even know Johnny
had a disc and I cant deal with
any Dont play games with me Mr
Fairlane bullshit

GRENDEL
Dont play games ugh Did you
say you dont have the third ugh
(a beat of
contemplation)

Im not going to torture you Ford

The two Gunslingers enter and along with everyone else in
the room look to Zuzu who obliviously pops a bubblegum
bubble

GRENDEL
Not her Ford Im afraid
sometimes a pussy is just a pussy
but a 1962 Fender Stratocaster
with an original Humbucking
Pick-ups maple neck strung
upside down for a left-handed
genius -- Jimi Hendrix is
something else entirely

The Punk Gunslinger lifts up Fords beloved guitar out
from under a couch in the office as Smiley bolts behind
Ford and holds his arms behind his back

FORD
No U-gh

PUNK GUNSLINGER
Hey thats the sound your koala
bear made when we hung it

Grendel throws down the 23 and takes the guitar from the
Punk He gently places the guitar on the table and takes
a comfy seated position on the couch He flicks a
switchblade and lowers it toward the guitar

GRENDEL
It doesnt have to be like this

FORD
Oh God please dont
Grendel fiendishly plucks a guitar string with the knife
Ford acts as if it was cutting off his tongue instead

GRENDEL
Dont you think this guitar would
look a lot neater with Fords name
on it

GUNSLINGERS
Ooooooh yeah

The Punk begins carving the letter F on the front of the
guitar Ford gets dizzy Smiley has to slap him awake

FORD
Rape

The Punk Gunslinger removes a power drill from his coat
pocket and hands the cord to the Heavy Metal Gunslinger
who scampers to an outlet to plug it in Julian takes the
DRILL and turns it ON GUNNING the power with wicked bliss

FORD

Okay Okay You got me Boy
you guys are tough I have the
third disc Indeed I Do
Yes sir

(smiling a light

bulb dimly lighting)
Yeah you assholes its in a very
safe place with instructions to
have it sent directly to the police
if I dont make a phone call by seven
oclock So if youll excuse us

GRENDEL
Its 730 You really should get
a watch

FORD
Ah I didnt say seven PM now
did I

Grendel laughs and lights up a cigarette He motions for
Smiley to let go of Ford Ford proceeds to light up a
cigarette also

GRENDEL

Ford Ford Ford Its too bad
it had to end like this We could
have been friends Were so much
alike We both know Rock-N-Roll
is all bullshit That life is a
disease and everyones a victim
Hell we even smoke the same brand
of cigarettes
Ford is spooked He tosses his cigarette away

FORD
I just gave up smoking A last
drink

GRENDEL

Im running a little late You

see Im having a party at THE

Club to introduce the new lead
singer for Black Vomit Everyone
in the industry will be there
including our friend Don Cleveland

FORD
What about Don

GRENDEL

Before Black Vomit starts its set
Don will have his head blown off
The papers next week will reveal
that he was partners with Bobby
Johnny and Collie in the Grendel
Records scam He killed them

to pay off a debt to the mob or
something lame like that And
then the mob iced him Its all
more tasteful than it sounds

ZUZU (OS)
I cant believe you guys hung a
koala bear

Everyone turns in dismay to the batty girl The Heavy
Metal Gunslinger is working the bar

ZUZU
That is So Graphic I mean
Im still in shock here You know
I had a dream about a priest
hanging a koala bear during my
first communion

GRENDEL
(reading lips)
Is she saying what I think shes

FORD
Im afraid so you want her

ZUZU
But you know that was just a
dream Doesnt really count

FORD and GRENDEL
Shut up
The Metal Gunslinger brings Julian and Ford each a glass
of vodka

FORD

(raising his glass)
Julian youre evil incarnate
And you know while Ima little
angry that youre going to kill me
and all I gotta salute your
toughness Life threw you lemons
and gall darnit you made lemonade
Julian Grendel guys like you dont
grow on trees Heres to you

(smashing the glass

into Julians head)

sucking my dick

Grendel spins off howling in pain The Punk and Heavy
Metal Gunslingers rush toward Ford but he dispatches both
of them with swift punches Smiley though grabs him from
behind and holds his arms

SMILEY
Take a free hit bro Come on

GRENDEL
Sure

Grendel wipes off his face and steps toward Ford He
then stops and with all his might backhands Zuzu across
the face sending her tumbling to the floor He smiles
and then gives her a kick in the ribs for good measure
Ford breaks from Smiley and rushes down to Zuzu

GRENDEL
Kill them Not quickly

FORD
Are you okay

ZUZU
If you ask me that question one more

As Zuzu speaks Ford reaches in her mouth and pulls out
her gum with one hand With the other hand he removes
one of her earrings

FORD
When I say no run for the door

GRENDEL
(pausing at doorway)
Oh wait One sec Open the window

The Heavy Metal Gunslinger pries open the window Julian
picks up Fords guitar with two hands and heaves it over
Ford and Zuzus head and out the window
FORD
Shit

GRENDEL
Ciao

Grendel and the Punk Gunslinger make a brisk exit The
Heavy Metal Gunslinger draws his gun while Smiley smiles
and cracks his knuckles

For stands up and speaks whimsically

FORD
Dont hurt me

Smiley punches Ford across the jaw -- snapping his head
back He then grabs him by the collar and thrusts him
across the wall -- smack -- over the desk -- into the
wall Right next to a wall socket

Zuzu felinely kneels before the Heavy Metal Gunslinger
sneakily picking up the 23 CD from the floor

HEAVY METAL GUNSLINGER
Now were talking

Ford jams the earrings from his right hand into the
chewed gum from his left hand and then shoves them into
a wall socket

FORD
Now
Zuzu punches the Gunslinger in the groin -- the EARRINGS
SPARK -- and the lights go out The CLASSICAL MUSIC

GRINDS TO A HALT and gives way to the sound of GRUNTS
and PUNCHES

INT HALLWAY
Ford rounds a corner holding a hand

FORD
Move it

Ford pulls the hand around the corner It belongs to the
dazed Heavy Metal Gunslinger Ford with a brutal yank
pulls him into his knee doubling him up Ford watches
him drop to the floor as Zuzu rounds the corner holding
her eye

ZUZU
Nice left you got there jerk

FORD
Sorry it was dark now come on
ANOTHER CORRIDOR

Ford and Zuzu race around another corridor JZuzu sees a
door -- Roof Access -- she opens it
ZUZU
This way
FORD
No wait

Smiley and the Heavy Metal Gunslinger chug around the
corner Ford follows Zuzu

EXT ROOF - NIGHT

Ford and Zuzu stumble out of a door smack into a giant
10-foot needle jutting into the night sky Ford
immediately wields back around and grabs for the roof
access door but it has closed He tries to open it
but it has locked A BULLET EXPLODES the lock

ZUZU
Suck a dick I left my purse

FORD
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner
in Mogambo Fuck the purse

were gonna die-e-e
ZUZU
Reality-reality-reality --

Outrageous building huh

FORD
Ye-ah

VERY WIDE - CAPITAL RECORDS BUILDING

A 14-story stack of records on Hollywood and Vine

Circular awnings ring each floor creating the illusion of
a tower of discs

EXT CAPITOL ROOF

Smiley and the Metal Gunslinger plow onto the roof Alone

EXT 14TH FLOOR LEDGE

Ford and Zuzu are climbing down and around the side of the
building

The ledge is about a foot wide -- the sheet metal awning
juts down and out at a forty-five degree angle just under
and out from the ledge
FORD
And you say I never take you
anywhere

The two of them shimmy and sway along the edge until they
reach a space in the awning Ford starts to lower himself
through the space to the next level nine feet below

EXT CAPITAL ROOF

Smiley looks over the edge -- straight down Between the
cracks we can see Ford and Zuzu on their precarious journey

SMILEY
Lets rock

The Gunslinger gives him a Youve got to be kidding
look Smiley keeps smiling Nope The Metal Gunslinger
takes off his gunslinger coat and his Armani jacket

EXT 12TH FLOOR AWNING

Zuzus feet dangle -- she hits the tiny ledge Ford
steadies her

Ford tries to open a window but its locked He tries

the next one -- theyre all locked Ford kicks the
window Bonk -- the glass bounces unaffected -- Whoa
-- Ford teeters from the hit -- falling -- Zuzu grabs him

and pulls him back up

FORD
Pretty smooth huh

ZUZU

Smooth I know this is dangerous
and everything but its kind of fun
Ever see Batman you know when
Batman and Robin are climbing up the
side of the building and somebody
sticks their head outside the window
and says I forget what they said
but its pretty funny

FORD
Why have you come to my planet

A BULLET ZINGS by Zuzu shrieks -- they look up
Between the spaces the Metal Gunslinger points the
business end of a gun between the awnings from the 14th

floor ledge

FORD
Around

They move along the side of the building -- making for the
next space in the awning

DIFFERENT LEDGE - WITH SMILEY

Smiley hits the ledge and teeters He steadies and moves on
11TH FLOOR - FORD AND ZUZU

drop down -- start working their way through the next gap
WIDE AND HIGH ON ALL THIS

The SHOT SPINS AROUND the Capitol Building Ford and Zuzu
are zigging and zagging and dropping down The Metal
Gunslinger follows them from a few floors above -- going
left and right Smiley is concentrating on going straight
down

HEAVY METAL GUNSLINGER

prepares to go down Sticking his gun in his mouth he
slaps down on the rim of the next ledge

NINTH FLOOR - RIGHT BETWEEN FORD AND ZUZU

FORDZUZU
Wow

His gun still in his mouth the Gunslinger swings and flaps
his arms trying to get his equilibrium Falling backward
he yelps out of the corner of his gun-clenching mouth

HEAVY METAL GUNSLINGER
He-lp

Zuzu instinctively reaches out for him And grabs the
GUN And the trigger

She innocently BLOWS the back of his head off The
corpse bounces off the awning

ZUZU
Oops

EXT VINE - ATOP WONDER BREAD TOUR BUS - NIGHT

On the roof of the Wonder Bread tour bus a TOUR GUIDE is
blabbing through a bullhorn to a bunch of seated tourists

TOUR GUIDE
The building is a symbol for the
music industry a business where
anything can happen and usually

The corpse of the Heavy Metal Gunslinger slams down before
him with a crash that turns into a gaping hole on the bus
TOUR GUIDE
does

BACK TO NINTH FLOOR
Zuzu flings the gun away from herself

ZUZU
Ick

FORD
I wont ask why you would want to
help someone trying to kill you
but hey good job Shall we

Ford helps Zuzu drop her feet into the hap and Smileys
hand juts up and grabs Zuzus legs Smiley is in midair
pulling down on Zuzu He must have jumped up to snatch them

SMILEY
Hows it going

EIGHTH FLOOR

Smiley and Zuzu fall down as one Slap -- Smiley hits
the ledge -- lets go of Zuzu -- and she falls outward

Clang -- Zuzu slams into the slanted metal awning -- her
feet slide out from underneath her like a bad ice skater

-- she reaches for the ledge -- misses -- but slap She

grabs onto the top edge of the awning

She lays there at a forty-five degree angle her feet
sticking out into the atmosphere

And Smiley stands right above her grinning Smiley rests

a steadying hand on the wall -- sticks his foot out
towards the top of the awning -- towards Zuzus fingers
ZUZU
Oh Fo-ord
THUNK -- Ford drops from above and lands on the ledge

behind Smiley Smileys gloved hands lunge out at Ford
and grab his throat Ford shoots his hands out and
locks them on Smileys neck

Zuzu hangs on for dear life as Ford and Smiley squeeze-
push-twist -- both almost dependant on the other to keep
balance Bored Smiley decides to finish off Ford He
swings Fords head out a bit then in smashing Fords
skull against the building

The force of the smash knocks them both off balance
They twist -- tip -- let go of each other -- and both
fall -- CLANG -- CLANG -- onto the METAL awning right
next to Zuzu -- Smiley in the middle Each holding on
with one hand to the CREAKING AWNING they both start
to wail punches on each other Then kicking

ZUZU
Fluck this

Zuzu gets into the act With her nails And Smileys
eyes She rips away blindly at his face

Smiley yells He loses his grip and starts to slide down
-- until he grabs Fords belt

Ford gleefully unloosens his belt and lets a desperate
and descending Smiley yank it all the way out Ford
reaches out to the belt at the last second He savors
the sight of Smiley hanging on for dear life

FORD
I want you to say that youre the
biggest sissy in the whole wide world

SMILEY
Im The Biggest Sissy In
The Wide World

FORD
Okay B-y-e

Before Ford can let go of the belt he catches sight of
Smileys glove ripping open revealing a Snoopy-in-a
fighter-pilot-suit ring just like his sons The Kid
The Snoopy and the Red Baron SONG PLAYS a couple of
beats Ford looks to God

FORD
Hey God Youre an asshole

ZUZU
Let go of the belt What are you
doing You got mad at me for
trying to save the other guy

Smiley starts to pull himself back up as Ford contemplates

FORD
I cant kill this kids father

ZUZU
Who do you think you are Ford
The tooth fairy Kill Kill Kill

FORD
This is fucking unbelievable Zuzu
its a long story you see

Smiley suddenly lurches up to Fords neck and starts
strangling away And thats when the awning bends -- it
wasnt built for this The angle changes from forty-five
to twenty-five as all three people slam down and bounce

The Snoopy comes off in Fords hand
They all lose their grip And free fall

In midair Zuzu latches onto Fords legs and Smiley
latches onto Zuzus legs Fords elbow crunches through
the edge of the next metal awning His encrusted elbow
is the only thing that is keeping the dangling three-way
chain of himself Zuzu and Smiley from death All three
howl and scream in amusing syncopation

Ford looks to his left and stops screaming Hanging from
two good guitar strings off a building thermometer is
the guitar Ford loudly cheers and breaks into a
rendition of Purple Haze

FORD

Excuse me while I kiss the sky

(loudly hums a

Haze riff)
Whoooo Oh God buddy Im sorry
for calling you an asshole
Youre number one man Hey
Zuzu look I found my guitar

Ford looks down to Zuzu who is rightfully wailing her
head off Ford is slapped back into reality Ford looks
over to his guitar back down to Zuzu then up to God

He whines

FORD
Youre tearing me apart here

Ford reaches over to his guitar and unhooks it from the
thermometer with his free hand

FORD
Sorry Jimi

Ford fiercely flings down his guitar It blazes down into
Smileys face Smiley lets go of Zuzu with a final howl

Ford and the viewer watch the guitar swirl and spin in
the air before crunching to the ground

Zuzu climbs up Fords back and INTO the FRAME
ZUZU
Thanks I know how much that

thang meant to you

They semi-romantically kiss Zuzu squeals in mock
indignation
ZUZU
Hello Mr Tongue What a perv

FORD
(smiling)
You wish Come on lets get
outta here

ENTRANCE TO CAPITAL RECORDS BUILDING - LATER

placidly sits before the viewer Suddenly Ford and
Zuzu drop down from the TOP of the FRAME and land on
their feet their BACKS turned TO the CAMERA They stand
shellshocked and motionless for a moment until Ford
turns around and tries to catch his breath Zuzus body
language says that she still thinks shes on a ledge

An AMIABLE TOURIST COUPLE approach the devastated duo

AMIABLE MALE TOURIST

FORD

Jazz rushes up to the surly pair wearing an eyepatch
and a forearm cast

JAZZ

Ford and Zuzu give Jazz the look of death before contin-
uing down the sidewalk their heads drearily looking
down

FORD

ZUZU

JAZZ

a map in the Thomas Guide sounds

Jazz and Zuzu futiley look in the air as Ford moves for-
ward with his head still down Ford suddenly stops and
speaks with an increasingly beatific smile

FORD
Ladies lifes not that complicated

The women race back to Ford as he falls to his knees and
howls

FORD
Art baby

The VIEWERS VIEWPOINT WILDLY SWINGS AROUND and DOWN to
see a star a Hollywood Walk of Fame star Art Mooney
is printed just above a five inch record symbol

The ladies kneel down to the brain-racing Ford

ZUZU
Oh how sweet your friends got

FORD

Ford frantically massages the star He digs his nails
into the little record symbol and POP It flips off the
star revealing a five inch hole A silvery rainbow
sparkle comes from that inch Ford sticks his finger

And pulls out a compact disc (a red number three right
on the disc) A Black Vomit one The third CD

A flash of reflected light hits Grendels face causing
him to wince He wiggles his head and continues

GRENDEL
But Ive talked long enough Now
the moment youve been waiting for
Id like you to meet the new singer
for Black Vomit Kyle Troy

Kyle Troy the untalented prettyboy from the studio comes
out wearing a heavy metal-style wig to the bullshit
applause of the crowd He is accompanied by a security
guard

Grendel puts down the radio mike to applaud Kyle The
flashing of reflected light hits Grendel a little more
fiercely Annoyed he looks offstage to its source

flashbulbs He steps over the radio mike he placed down
on the stage A nubile hand reaches over the stage and
grabs it

SAM
I used to be just like you abusing
women to hide my emotional

insecurities I realize now that

Sam the Sleazebag to the rescue

A dazed Punk Gunslinger leaps up and swings his fist at
Sam who catches it with one hand

SAM
Youre ten seconds away from the
most embarrassing moment of your
life

Sam and the Punk engage in a violent howling wrestling
match The Punk nails Sam with a kidney punch and then
bolts toward his gun Jazz stands before him holding it
nervously She lifts up her eyepatch to get better aim

Oh please Ford Ill do any --

Grendel humbly approaches Ford but then levels a karate-
style kick into Fords ribs He snatches the CD from
Ford and splits it apart in the three pieces

He savagely begins eating the CD pieces bloodily cutting
his lips

Ford pulls five more CDs from his pocket

FORD
And may I suggest for dessert the
five copies I made

GRENDEL
Fuck me

FORD
Maybe later but first I want like
to know why youd steal from your
own company

GRENDEL
When I was young I read Billboard
and I could not believe how much
Grendel Records and how little
of it my idiot father Old Jack
Grendel got

FORD
Yeah its pretty amazing how much
cash you gotta give to the actual
artists who create the music Those
ingrates really take a bite But
seriously when Pops died you got
Vomit Crunch and Sutton to help
finance a CD Cleans operation
You got greedy and they tried to
get the three discs together to
threaten you but

GRENDEL
What is this are you holding a
microphone behind my head

Holding the radio mike Zuzu scampers up behind Grendel
with giddy self-consciousness at the adventure at hand
As Grendel launches into a tirade Zuzu holds up the
mike just behind him She reacts to his words with over-
the-top facial expressions

GRENDEL
I should kill more music people
When I was sixteen I wrote an
opera the greatest piece of music
ever created in the 20th Century
outside the Dirty Dancing
soundtrack It was called Paco

the Shoeshine Boy When I showed
it to my father he said it wasnt
happening That no playlists

worth his while would touch it
CLUB

The crowd rumbles into silence to listen in shock to
Grendels words coming over the loudspeaker

GRENDEL (VO)
Lets face it making money is the
only art form open to innovation
Whoever says theyre in the
business because they like music
is a lying pathetic piece of shit
or total idiot like Kyle Troy

STAGE
A tear streams down Kyles face
OFFSTAGE

Grendel continues to dig his own grave with Zuzu having a
ball in the bg exploiting his deafness with commentary

ZUZU
Is this guy flucked up or what
I think hes going to blow

GRENDEL
The day my father turned down
Paco I dedicated my life to
taking over this fucking industry
and making it so disgusting so
sleazy and so corrupt that it
would have to self-destruct I even
pissed in the punchbowl tonight

CLUB

A line of industry types by the punch bowl simultan-
eously spit outward

An amused eyepatchless Jazz Sam in tow passes them on
their way to the bar Seeing Jazz the bartender pulls

out a fountain glass in order to make a vodka milkshake

BACKSTAGE
Ford is actually concerned about the frothing Grendel

FORD
Man Julian that accident took
away more than your hearing

GRENDEL
Accident Accident You naive
pussball when I realized my life
of music could only be a life of
music industry I cut my fucking
ears off so Id only hear my music
Here look

Grendel pulls off his plastic ears and holds them out to
Ford

ZUZU
Hoh graphic Im going to dream of
ears for a year Ugh

FORD
Just be thankful he wasnt
dissatisfied with his sex life

The Zuzu-directed comment causes Grendel to wield around

GRENDEL
You little bitch

ZUZU
(guilelessly into
the mike)
Feelings whoa oh feelings

Grendel loses it The inner CLASSICAL MUSIC in his head
comes ON the SOUNDTRACK playing ten times faster than
normal

Zuzu with a squeal runs off to the stage Grendel
pursues

STAGE

Zuzu and Grendel run out in view of everyone Grendel

looks out at the dead silent tableau of people who were
cheering him only moments before

The crowd starts to boo

Ford walks out onstage having a hard time keeping down
a grin Grendel suddenly yanks a gun from the security
guard and points it at Ford who stops smiling Kyle

Troy faints

BAR
The bartender puts a last blast of vodka atop the shake
and is right about to light it on fire but Sam grabs
and throws

SAM
Jazz

Jazz catches it and she throws the shake up to the stage

JAZZ
Ford

Ford grabs the shake and flings the contents into Grendel
who gets off a SHOT with his GUN Ford dives behind an
amp as Julian lets another SHOT FLY Ford pulls from his
pockets matchbooks from a multitude of LA clubs He
lights a handful of them on fire as Grendel moves in for
the kill

GRENDEL
Im still the king

FORD
(popping up)
Julian youre fired

Ford flings his homemade fireball into Grendels vodka
doused tux He explodes in flames staggering around
the stage

CROWD
Jaime and Larry watch in bemused detachment

JAIME
Is this for real Larry

LARRY
No way Jaime Hes wearing this
gooey stuff on his body that the
flames cant affect Bobby Vomit
opened his act this way

STAGE

The flaming Grendel stumbles to an electronic keyboard

set and begins playing a warped piano solo The KEY-
BOARDS spark and churn amid the flames before grandly
EXPLODING along with Julian Grendel The sprinkler system
blasts on

CROWD

A deadpan Larry turns to a jaw-dropped Jaime

LARRY
Now that I have no idea
Ford bounds off the stage He is oblivious to the
sprinkler system-induced rain Don greets him

DON
Thanks for the promotion man

FORD
No prob

Jazz romantically moves through the makeshift rain Ford
strides to her when Zuzu sprouts up holding hands with a
beefy rock

ZUZU
Look who I found Its Damion
Flemm Hes taking me on tour to
Japan

Ford laughs almost fatherly then asks the question

FORD
So Zuzu Are you okay

ZUZU
Yeah Ford Im okay

Zuzu tenderly kisses him

Seeing this Jazz glumly droops her head and turns around
heading back out the club entrance She passes an enter-
ing Lt Amos and detective Lt Amos is wearing the
infamous white John Travolta Saturday Night Fever
ensemble with gold chains

The sprinkler system has gone off

LT AMOS
You do realize that tonight is
disco appreciation night at the
Coconut Teazer

DETECTIVE
Im sorry sir but we got a report
that Fairlane and the psycho-
killer-groupie are here

LT AMOS
There they are Hey

Ford and Zuzu turn to Amos with Oh brother expressions
They walk toward him with smiling faces

LT AMOS
I shouldve known you two were in
this together
Zuzu drops to her knees

LT AMOS
Sorry sexual favors wont help

Zuzu slams Amos in the groin sending him to his knees
Ford shoves the CDs in his pocket

FORD
Happy listening

Ford looks for Jazz all around him with a confused expres-—
sion The Ovaries approach two of them have their arms
wrapped around Sam the ex-sleazebag

SAM
Ive learned my lesson Ford
Thanks

OVARY TWO

Isnt he the best Why dont you
come out with us

FORD
Cant Have you seen my assistant
Jazz

OVARY ONE

She took off Said something about
you being a real asshole

Ford glumly droops his head and shuffles away
EXT CORNER OF FORDS STREET - LATER IN NIGHT

An RTD BUS RUMBLES to the corner of Fords street The
sad Detective shuffles off the bus to the tune of the
SADDEST SONG in film history

As Ford walks toward his house he passes his debris
still splayed out on the street from the night before
mangled gold records smoldered speakers his red hotline
now burntline phone and then theres that funky sliding-
arm-and-gun apparatus with a gun attached Ford picks it
up sliding the gun back and forth with a rueful smile

Fords house is looking gloomy dark and missing a lot
of pieces Ford walks through the intact but dis-
embodied front door

INT FORDS HOUSE

Head still drooping Ford closes the door behind him

A CLICK causes him to look up Sitting atop a battered
piece of couch blood stains neatly blended into his tie-
dye shirt is Smiley holding a gun Cheerful as always
SMILEY
Hows it going

FORD
You gotta be kidding This is
unfuckingbelievable I have to
start the evening crawling down
Capital Records I shoulda chose
suicide then but oh no the night
was young Next up my guitar
The second most important thing
I own and now its toothpicks for
the homeless on Hollywood
Boulevard Then then after I
burned up your brother Jazz I
should say as a fucking footnote
Ive usually treated women like
shit -- used corsages the wet
spot you know giving out Dominos
Pizzas phone number and saying
its mine Tonight was different
I felt respect I felt love Then
Jazz left me and now I get to die

SMILEY
The point

FORD
Let me go out like a man

SMILEY
(tossing away
his gun)
Anyway you want it asshole

Ford super-swiftly raises his arm and Ta-daah The gun
slides smoothly down his arm into his hand Smiley for
the first time in our story stops smiling Ford FIRES a
cute hole in his forehead sending him crashing into a wall
that was barely standing to begin with It crumbles down

FORD
(to his arm)
Thanks for working

(to Smiley)
Thanks for being a hu-uge bonehead
Let me go out like a man -- Ha

EXT FORDS HOUSE

Ford emerges from the more disembodied than ever front
door The Kid stands before him on the front lawn

THE KID
So did you find my dad

FORD
Well I got some good news and
some bad news

THE KID
Yeah go on

FORD
Good news is that yeah I found
him The bad news is

Ford raises his hand He is wearing the Snoopy the
Fighter Pilot ring

FORD

THE KID
What kind of sentimental bullshit

FORD

Hey I love you too you little
jerk Jesus guy tries to make a
commitment and hes gotta eat shit

THE KID
Whos my real father man

FORD
He he lives in South America

archeologist-dentist kind of thing

The Kid starts to sob Ford reaches out and grabs his
hand Their Snoopy rings touch

The two tough guys walk down the street together holding
hands The viewers VIEWPOINT HANGS BACK allowing them
some privacy

FORD (VO)

case load you interested This

Suddenly Jazzs VOLKSWAGEN SCREECHES before the pair
The viewers VIEWPOINT QUICKLY GOES TO the action as Jazz
jettisons from her car holding out some keys

JAZZ

crap between us Im sorry Im

FORD
Lets get hitched I guess I

beautiful thing

JAZZ

The moment is broken by a RINGING PHONE Ford shushes
Jazz with his finger and then backtracks to his burnt-
ridiculously-still-working hotline phone He picks up

FORD
K-O-D-S is going to make me rich

EXT ISLAND - PERFECT DAY

The viewers VIEWPOINT is LULLED TO a friendly hut by a
beautiful tropical cove A humble hand-drawn sign reads
FORD FAIRLANE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR - FISHERMEN ONLY

SWINGING AROUND the hut the viewer DISCERNS Ford Jazz
and The Kid kicking back on chaise lounges in silly
tropical shirts with identical sunglasses

FORD
I love the music industry
especially the tacky radio
giveaway part

The viewers VIEWPOINT PANS OVER a bit to reveal sitting
next to The Kid on a very small chaise lounge and ina
very small leather jacket is the koala bear with a sweet
little neck brace

CLOSE ON FORD

FORD
Wha-at You didnt really think
