INT PATIO TEPEJI 21 - DAY
Yellow triangles inside red squares
Water spreading over tiles Grimy foam

The tile floor of a long and narrow patio stretching through
the entire house On one end a black metal door gives onto
the street The door has frosted glass windows two of which
are broken courtesy of some dejected goalee

CLEO CleotildeCleodegaria Gutiérrez a Mixtec indigenous
woman about 26 years old walks across the patio nudging
water over the wet floor with a squeegee

As she reaches the other end the foam has amassed in a
corner timidly showing off its shiny little white bubbles
but -

A GUSH OF WATER surprises and drags the stubborn little
bubbles to the corner where they finally vanish whirling
into the sewer

Cleo picks up the brooms and buckets and carries them to -
THE SMALL PATIO -

Which is enclosed between the kitchen the garage and the
house She opens the door to a small closet puts away the
brooms and buckets walks into a small bathroom and closes
the door

The patio remains silent except for a radio announcer his
enthusiasm melting in the distance and the sad song of two
caged little birds

The toilet flushes Then water from the sink A beat the
door opens

Cleo dries her hands on her apron enters the kitchen and
disappears behind the door connecting it to the house

INT - GROUND FLOOR - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo crosses the dark antique wood breakfast room then the
modern light and angled wood dining room and goes up the
stairs reaching the hall

Beyond the hall there are two living rooms one with heavy
green velvet sofas and antique cabinets with records and a
stereo There’s a piano next to the wall

The other living room with its light sofas and cocktail tray
and siphon attempts to look more modern

There’s a giant painting in red and purple hues of a woman
leaning on a clay pitcher

In the other living room there’s another painting also
large but more somber In a dark stone cell a monk brings
solace to a shackled prisoner who covers his face with his
hands in desperation

INT - UPPER LEVEL - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

The stairs go up to a central hall surrounded by four
bedrooms and an enormous bathroom

Cleo makes up the bedroom the double bed is already made it
has an ornate mahogany headboard that matches the night
tables

She collects the dirty clothes from the floor and carries
them out to the hall where she piles them up onto a growing
mound of laundry

The upstairs hallway doubles as a TV room The bathroom is
yet to be cleaned but two out of three bedrooms are
completely done

Cleo walks into a room with two small beds for the kids She
picks up the clothes first and then puts away the boy and
girl toys spread across the entire floor

She’s started making one of the beds when she hears someone
calling from downstairs -

ADELA (0S)
Manita It’s almost one

Startled Cleo exclaims -

CLEO
Ay chict

She exits the bedroom carrying dirty laundry

In the hallway she gathers the pile of clothing and carries
it hurrying down the stairs

INT - DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo heads down the stairs carrying the pile of clothes

She crosses the hall and dining rooms and disappears behind
the door that opens to the kitchen

After a beat through -
THE WINDOW
We see her exit to the small patio

She leaves the clothes at the foot of the metal stairs that
lead to the roof and hurries out to the street

EXT - HOUSE - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Tepeji street spans barely two blocks halved by Monterrey
Avenue its tired homes built in the 1930s

Sad and defeated Tepeji 21 sits in the middle of the block
resting on its solid ground which blends with the grey
concrete of the sidewalk

The house is all white save for an almost-maroon red strip
running along its facade and for the black wrought iron over
the windows and doors

Next to the upper left hand corner of the door there’s a
ceramic tile number 21

The door opens and Cleo exits

She hurries out to the Avenue and once she reaches the
corner she turns right

EXT - STREET - MONTERREY AVE - TLAXCALA - DAY

Cleo leaves Tepeji and walks down the avenue where there’s a
considerable amount of traffic

As she reaches the corner she crosses the avenue and
continues on -

beauty salon

EXT - CONDESA KINDERGARTEN - DAY

A small crowd gathers by the kindergarten entrance It’s
pickup time Cleo arrives and goes into the school After a
moment she comes out with PEPE a 5 year-old boy carrying a
barely dried “work of art”

EXT - TLAXCALA STREET - DAY

Cleo walks next to Pepe who carries his “work of art” just
a little kid in shorts and t-shirt

out of a yellow radio

The metallic creak of the stairs announces the arrival of
followed by Pepe

Paco

CLEO
You know you can’t come up here

PACO
I looked after him the whole way
up

CLEO
Your mom is going to be angry

But Paco has started his game pulling Pepe along with him

PACO
I’m going to come out of here and
you come over here and when I get

shoot you first and you’ll fall

wide open

Paco takes bullets like Sonny Corleone against the wall of
the neighboring house

CLEO
Just don’t play next to the edge

PACO
Cmon

Paco moves away on the roof while Pepe hides behind the water
tank

Paco comes back but now hiding like an enemy spy all the way
to the water tank He tries to go around it with his gun
held high but -

Pepe comes at him from behind with murderous intent

Paco reacts and turns around tries to point with his gun but
Pepe sprays him with sure shots and hides behind the water

tank leaving Paco confused at first then furious-

PACO (CONT’D)
You were supposed to die

From behind the water tank Pepe defies him -

PEPE
Why aren’t you the one who dies

PACO
Cause it’s my game

PEPE
Then I don’t wanna play anymore

PACO
Well then I don’t want you to
play sissy

He walks off angry He goes down the staircase each step
resonating with metallic moans

Pepe walks over to see him go and stops in the middle of the
roof clearly disappointed

He stays there for a long time until suddenly -
A spray of invisible bullets shoots through him and Pepe
falls dead his arms spread open like Paco said And he

stays there lying down motionless on the ground

Cleo dries her hands and walks over to him She stops and
watches him -

CLEO
What happened to you

Without opening his eyes Pepe answers from the ground

PEPE
I’m dead

CLEO
Well let’s go down then

PEPE

CLEO

go down
PEPE
If you die you can’t live again
CLEO

Cleo sits on the ground next to Pepe who remains motionless

CLEO (CONT’D)
I can’t live without my Pepe

Cleo lies down next to Pepe arms also extended and closes
her eyes -

CLEO (CONT’D)
I’m also dead

And so she remains still Pepe next to her A DC 8 flies
overhead

Pepe opens an eye to see Cleo She’s not moving and seems not
to be breathing at all Pepe reaches his hand and takes
Cleo’s

PEPE

Pepe lies down next to her arms outstretched

CLEO (CONT’D)
Close your eyes

They both close their eyes

CLEO (CONT’D)
I like being dead

Pepe holds her hand
The two of them lie dead on the roof -

The afternoon quiet hours have begun Church bells ring in
the distance

All around them a landscape of roofs mushrooming in all
directions

In many of them other women wash or hang laundry The wind
carries the hum of different radios and dogs barking

The whistle of a sweet potato cart

The quiet universe

INT - MAIN BATHROOM - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT
Cleo bathes Sofi and Pepe in the bathtub

Sofi’s hair is full of soap and she plays at making different
hairdos in the mirror

Pepe has a submarine but isn’t playing with it He’s pensive
PEPE
Cleo if you died right now would

you go to heaven or hell

CLEO
And why would I die

PEPE
I’m just saying Heaven or hell

CLEO
You’re killing me all the time

Pepe is getting annoyed
PEPE

Cleo fills a small bucket with water and tells Sofi -

CLEO

As she pours water to rinse her hair

him
EXT - PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT
The frosted glass panels light up and we hear -
A horn honking -
Ta-ta ta-ta ta-ta ta-taaaaaaa

Behind the door the powerful and tantalizing hum of a V8

From inside the car booms XELA radio station playing “Un
bal” from Symphonie Fantastique

BORRAS immediately starts barking at the door
Cleo and Adela rush to the patio-

ADELA
Well he’s in early

Cleo grabs Borras and drags him to the back of the patio

CLEO
Don’t you know he’s leaving
tomorrow

Adela begins to open the door

Pepe and Sofi peek out from the hall Holding Borras Cleo
orders them to -

CLEO (CONTD)
Wait there

The V8 impatiently purrs behind the door and finally -

Adela opens the door to reveal -

The front of a 1970 2-DOOR BLACK GALAXIE 500 Its powerful
headlights flood the patio all the way to the back lighting

Cleo who holds Borras

The Galaxie 500 slowly pulls in but it’s too large for the
space leaving only about an inch on each side of the doors

The front of the car is in then it breaks -
The left side is about to touch the door frame

The tires turn right accompanied by the SCREECH of rubber
against tile

The Galaxie 500 moves further in but then breaks again -
The right side is about to touch

The black power steering wheel turns and -

The wheels veer left SCREECHING

It echoes through the patio syncopated with the waltz
emanating from the radio

Sefora Sofia comes to the hall door next to Sofi and Pepe

SOFI
Dad’s home early

The car moves forward a couple of inches and stops
The gear shifts to R -

The Galaxie 500 backs up a few inches breaks

The gear shifts to D -

The car inches forward slowly free of the door frame It’s
almost halfway in when it stops

The wheels veer right and -

SCREECH

And the waltz picks up its rhythm

The car moves forward half a yard and breaks
The tires line straight up and -

The Galaxie 500 has made it through the door frame and is now
entirely inside the patio -

As the waltz reaches its grand finale
The car parks right next to the hall entrance door -
The engine shuts off and with it the music -
Sofi and Pepe lunge through the door -
SENOR ANTONIO

There there there Let me get

out
Sefora Sofia pulls the children to her and -
SENOR ANTONIO comes out of the car he’s 40 years old with a
few white hairs in his beard He’s still wearing his white
doctor’s coat

The children jump on him immediately -

Cleo and Adela walk in step hurrying down the sidewalk in a
moving obstacle race

Adela is faster but Cleo is more agile and tougher
Adela takes the lead but runs into a bus stop with families
getting off Cleo manages to slip through the crowd and keeps

going

The sidewalk is a little less full So Adela takes advantage
of this and catches up just as they arrive to -

And so he pulls out the letter and
gives it to me But the letter
was there with a bunch of other
letters and as he’s pulling it
out they all spill onto the floor

You want to go to the Alameda

Fermin smiles at her

FERMIN
Wait a sec

He walks up to Ramon who is at the top of the line pulling
money out of his wallet

Adela takes the opportunity to go see Cleo

ADELA
So manita no movies for you

CLEO
Well it’s so nice out no

ADELA
(interrupts )
Uuuuuuuuuuuuyyyyyy Right well

And she walks off with Ramén who is waiting to go inside the
theater Fermin walks back to Cleo and they leave

The street vendors continue their chorus The organ player is
quiet

INT - HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

The rules hang in a small frame over the door Disregarded
Behind the window the Sunday afternoon wanes and a
fluorescent sign peeks in advertising the hotel

Behind the open bathroom door a single bulb lights the sink
and a rusty mirror Fermin exits the bathroom carrying a pair
of nunchaku He’s completely naked

Cleo waits in bed timidly her slip still on She blushes as
she sees Fermin In front of the bathroom Fermin presents
his nunchaku -

FERMIN
Jodan Tsuki

He begins his nunchaku routine It’s an elaborate and studied
choreography the chained up sticks spinning like helixes
around him

The effect is both poetic and a little ridiculous but Cleo
hides her smile behind the sheets

Fermin finalizes his routine by striking different positions -

FERMIN (CONTD)
Jodan Tsuki Chudan Tsuki Mae
Geri

And he bows Cleo represses a laugh

FERMIN (CONTD)
What

Cleo covers her smile asking -

CLEO
So do you train every day

FERMIN
I have to I owe my life to martial
arts I grew up with nothing you
know

Outside the crowd’s hustle and bustle seems distant Fermin
leaves the nunchaku on a shelf and walks towards the foot of
the bed -

FERMIN (CONTD)
When I was a kid and my ma died

He crosses himself -

FERMIN (CONTD)
My aunt took me in Over there in
Neza And between my cousins who
beat me up and the bad influences
I started drinkingand then
huffingI was dying

He pauses —
FERMIN (CONTD)
But then I found out about martial
arts And so then those things
well you know suddenly everything
seemed well focused
Fermin pauses for a beat looks at Cleo -
FERMIN (CONTD)
I don’t really like telling people
about my stuff but with you
it’s different
He pulls his face close to hers and their lips meet and kiss
softly But soon Cleo moves her head bumping Fermin on the

nose

CLEO
Oh Sorry

Fermin pulls her in again and kisses her intensely and with
his mouth locked on Cleo’s he lies down slowly on top of her

They make love

Sefiora Sofia leans into the balustrade confused and
agitated She looks in Cleo’s direction but Cleo hides
behind a column

Sefora Sofia walks back into the parlour Cleo waits for her
to leave before coming out of her hiding spot She leans on
the balustrade and looks out at the night

When her eyes get used to the darkness she can see the
darker silhouettes of the trees in front of a sky that seems
to be lit from within

The cricket song melts into “Mummy Blues” ending on a
scratch and the accordion which seems to be playing a
mazurca The wind blows softly

Through the darkness in the woods a pale light appears
almost blending into the night Cleo watches in fascination

The Shocking Blue’s “Venus” starts to play The dogs start
barking

The shining starts to spread out in a warm attractive
pulsing like a will o’ the wisp or an apparition

Cleo watches hypnotized But what started off as a soft glow
begins to rip through the night in an intense gleam that
dances in the trees

The barks become more insistent Someone screams -

paths with yet other workers carrying various containers

lighting up

She sees people crossing to the other side of Insurgentes
where the marquee announces Melody but she doesn’t see the
boys She worries and walks to the following corner
searching

She’s almost made it to the newspaper stand in the next
corner when she turns and looks to -

THE OTHER SIDE OF INSURGENTES

And there amongst the crowd coming out of the theater and
spilling onto the sidewalk she sees Sefior Antonio He looks
light and happy and dances a silly step to the great delight
and laughter of the YOUNG WOMAN who holds his hand

And that’s when she also finally spots Beto hiding on one
side of the news stand lost in the pages of Caballero mens
magazine

Beyond Tofo is also holding a magazine but he’s not looking
at the naked women in its pages He’s looking at the other
side of the street people are coming out of the theater and
his dad is playing Fred Astaire to a Ginger Rogers that is
not his mother

In his silly dance move Sefior Antonio trips with an OLDER
COUPLE who is annoyed Sefor Antonio and the young woman
laugh and hurry off

OLDER COUPLE
So rude

Sefor Antonio stops turns and to sprays bullets at the older

couple with his make believe machine gun escaping with the
young woman Bonnie and Clyde hand in hand

his head

The young men applaud

PROFESSOR ZOVEK
You too can be a Kombateka Every
human being holds great potential

conditioning and through mental and
spiritual evolution

Zovek walks amongst them
PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
You too can develop your potential
But don’t expect any miracles the
only miracle lies in your own will

Zovek stops -

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
This is why mental development is
the true motor of physical
development

He stretches his arms taking his audience in -

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
And next up an act

A strip of bandage hangs from one of his hands swaying in
the dusty breeze -

ON THE EDGE OF THE FIELD -
Cleo and the small audience call out in surprise -
SMALL AUDIENCE
Oococooh
Zovek exclaims -
PROFESSOR ZOVEK
This is a routine that requires
absolute physical condition Only
martial arts masters and a few

great athletes can master it

Professor Zovek extends the bandage to a YOUTH in the first

both of his hands together in a diamond shape over his head

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
(Exhaling)
Huuuuuuuh

He is quiet
The young people look on expectantly
AT THE EDGE OF THE FIELD -
Cleo and the small audience look on in awe
Professor Zovek is standing motionless with his diamond
over his head and slowly very slowly starts to lift his left
foot
Time has stopped
The left foot lifts up folding at the knee until the thigh
is at a 45 degree angle and he remains motionless in that
position
The young people await in confusion for something to happen

AT THE EDGE OF THE FIELD -

Cleo and the small audience are also waiting a boy crouches
down

Professor Zovek continues on motionless -—

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
Are you disappointed Were you
expecting me to lift a jet or an
elephant

The audience laughs

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
You are witnessing an incredible
feat You don’t believe me Try it

Professor Zovek talks but remains motionless -

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
Just close your eyes and lift up a
foot

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
You don’t have to lift your leg to
a forty-five degree angle like me
or put your arms up Just close
your eyes and lift a foot

The young men close their eyes and try lifting one foot They
quickly lose their balance

The instructors also try it without succeeding

to physical realization

her head

Her eyes closed placid

Cleo wants to call him but is anxiously silent Fermin and
his group walk right past her

Cleo finally calls to him -

CLEO

Perhaps a little too loud Fermin turns and when he sees her
he stops Others in his group stop with him

FERMIN

brought in a gringo trainer and
another one from Korea Well the
American had been here already but
the Korean one is new

CLEO

FERMIN

Cleo hesitates -
CLEO

in law trains with you so
FERMIN
(interrupting)
It was Ramén right

CLEO
No no no

Fermin stops -

FERMIN
What’s it to me

Cleo follows him -

CLEO
Well the little one’s yours

Fermin walks faster

FERMIN
No fucking way

CLEO
But it is Fermin

Fermin stops completely and turns to Cleo -

FERMIN
I told you already there’s no
fucking way So if you don’t want
me to fuck you up real bad you and
your “little one” too don’t ever
fucking say it again and don’t ever

crate on the floor It’s almost full

OLD MAN WITH ORANGES

The old man gets up and Adela pays him with a crumpled 20-

feels the dog coming Borras chases him

CLEO

Borras lunges at the old man and sinks his teeth into the
enormous sack

Dozens of oranges fall out rolling all over the patio

The old man lets go of the sack and runs to the door while
Borras is trying to finish off the sack

man is almost at the door when the dog realizes this and runs
after him

ocean of oranges

INT DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21- DAY

The midday light bounces off the patio walls and slides in
through the great windows softly caressing the modern
mahogany table

Cleo polishes the surface with a rag She rubs the rag over
and over the same spot as if she wanted to wipe her own
reflection

The house is quiet Only the rumor of a conversation is
heard The phone cable extending all the way into the
bathroom under the stairs disappears inside the door

Sefiora Sofia is inside talking Her voice echoes in the
small space and filters though the doors Only a few words
can be clearly heard

Paco comes down the stairs slowly Stopping in the middle he
leans over the railway trying to hear better

Cleo keeps polishing the same area of the table and finally
realizes Paco is coming down the stairs

Paco’s in the hall and walks slowly to the bathroom door
leaning on the wall next to it

Cleo stops wiping her reflection and sees Paco who -

Slides and sits down on the floor He leans against the wall
and tries to move his ear closer to the door

From the dining room Cleo shoos him away gesturing but
Paco ignores her concentrated on listening to the
conversation distorted by the bathroom echo and muffled by
the door

SENORA SOFIA (0C)
-e-he wrote them letters from so-
called Vancouver

Cleo walks up to Paco gesturing When she reaches the hall
she stops at a respectful distance from the bathroom and its
conversation She stops and shakes her rag vigorously
calling Paco

SENORA SOFIA (0C) (CONT’D)
--he doesn’t even have enough of a
pair to tell the children

He sees her but shakes his head no repeatedly Cleo comes a
few steps closer still keeping her distance and speaks by
mouthing the words but almost without a single sound
CLEO
(articulating)
G-e-t o-u-t- o-f h-e-r-e

Paco is about to shake his head no but a cry punctures the
echoes and the walls - a deep desperate wail

Paco and Cleo freeze scared when suddenly -

The bathroom door opens and Senhora Sofia comes out carrying
the phone She sees Paco running away and grabs him -

SENORA SOFIA
And you What are you spying on

Her face is gaunt from crying from all the pain and
frustration that explode ina -

Giant slap that throws Paco down on the floor

Senhora Sofia immediately realizes what she’s done and
crouches down next to her son holding him crying -

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’m sorry Paco Why
were you eavesdropping Why were
you eavesdropping

The two of them cry on the floor Seflora Sofia sees Cleo
only a few steps away -

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
And you Why did you let him

She hugs Paco tightly -

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
Don’t say anything to your brothers
and sisters Don’t say a thing
Promise me Promise

To the side Cleo is motionless wishing she could join in
the hugging and the crying

Pepe comes in and sits down next to them leaning over to see
the letter

CLEO

SOFI
A dolphin No It’s like a
doggie

PEPE
It’s a seal In the fourth letter
my dad sent Paco he said he can
see the ocean from his hotel room
and that there are a lot of seals

Sofi considers the drawing -

his hotel

PEPE

You had said dolphin It looks
nothing like a dolphin

CLEO
No

SOFI
No

CLEO

So it’s not a dolphin What do you
think it is

Sofi and Pepe answer in a chorus -

SOFI AND PEPE
A seal

And they also laugh in chorus Distracted by her own sadness
Cleo turns to Pepe and does a surprise tickle attack
prolonging the laughter

When they’ve calmed down Pepe is lying on the bed and fixes
his eyes on Cleo

CLEO
What you looking at

PEPE
When’s your baby coming out

Sadness washes over Cleo again -

CLEO
Next month

SOFI

patients

Ignacio enters the lobby holding Cleo They immediately walk
to the reception area When they arrive he tells Cleo -

IGNACIO
Wait for me here Just a sec

He leaves Cleo and tries to talk to a hurried NURSE -

IGNACIO (CONT’D)
Excuse me

But the nurse doesn’t pause she only points -

NURSE

Ignacio sees the line and Cleo has another contraction
standing

CLEO

Ignacio yells out to make himself heard on top of the racket
of questions orders complaints and cries -

IGNACIO

No one seems to hear him Ignacio insists -
IGNACIO (CONTD)

Doctor Vélez Doctor Vélez

Doctor Vélez comes in through the medical team and patient
door She hurries to Ignacio -

DOCTOR VELEZ

Ignacio takes her to Cleo while Doctor Vélez lifts an arm and
emphatically calls out -

DOCTOR VELEZ (CONT’D)

A nurse runs to them pushing a wheelchair Senora Teresa has
finally arrived She is completely breathless

Doctora Vélez reaches Cleo-

DOCTORA VELEZ

Cleo looks at her fear is her only answer The nurse comes
in and helps Cleo sit down on the wheelchair Ignacio helps

DOCTORA VELEZ (CONTD)

Rosary in hand Senhora Teresa and Ignacio look at Cleo being
wheeled off through the door leading to -

INT - HALLWAY WITH ELEVATORS - OBGYN - DUSK

Cleo is in the wheelchair scared She is surrounded by
Doctor Vélez and the nurses They reach the elevators and
wait

The elevator doors open and they walk in The doors are about
to close when Sefior Antonio dressed in his white coat walks
up to them and goes in as well

INT - ELEVATOR - OBGYN - DUSK

The doors close

SENOR ANTONIO

Doctor Vélez smiles -

DOCTOR VELEZ

Cleo has a strong contraction -

CLEO

Sefior Antonio holds her hand and leans down to bring his face
closer to Cleo’s -

SENOR ANTONIO
Breathe Cleo Like this

Sefior Antonio begins inhaling and exhaling and blowing Cleo
tries to imitate him by looking at his face

INT - 6TH FLOOR LOBBY - OBGYN - DUSK

The elevator opens its doors and Cleo’s chair is wheeled out
by the nurses The sixth floor has no windows

They pass the nurse station and reach the door that leads to
the Birthing room Sefor Antonio leans in to Cleo -

SENOR ANTONIO
Doctor Vélez will only let me come
up to this point

Doctor Vélez interrupts -

DOCTOR VELEZ
Don’t mind me Come in if you like

SENOR ANTONIO
No uh I have a patient

His excuse hangs in the air and he puts a hand over Cleo’s
shoulder -

SENOR ANTONIO (CONTD)
You’re going to be just fine
Cleo

And he scurries down the hallway Frightened and confused
Cleo has barely registered the exchange

The nurses wheel her into -

INT - ADMISSION CUBICLES - OBGYN - DUSK

A cubicle separated from other cubicles by a curtain and
screens the gynecological bed is in the middle The nurses
help Cleo to get up and out of the wheelchair -

DOCTOR VELEZ
Take off all your clothes and put
on this gown OK

Cleo undresses She doesn’t have much privacy and behind the
poorly closed curtains she can see other women being
examined Doctor Vélez asks her questions to which she
answers in confusion

DOCTOR VELEZ (CONT’D)
When did you last menstruate

CLEO
September

DOCTOR VELEZ
Do you have a due date

CLEO
June 21st

DOCTOR VELEZ
Were there any complications during
the pregnancy

Scared Cleo shakes her head no

DOCTOR VELEZ (CONT’D)
How long ago did your water break

CLEO
About an hour and a half ago We
couldn’t get out of where we were
and

DOCTOR VELEZ
Was it clear

CLEO
Huh

DOCTOR VELEZ
The water Was it transparent

CLEO
No A little thick Like soup

Cleo is about to close her gown when she suffers a very
painful contraction Doctor Vélez orders -

DOCTORA VELEZ
Don’t push Cleo blow Help her get
on the bed

The nurses help Cleo lie down on the gynecological bed
Doctor Vélez touches the top of her belly -

DOCTOR VELEZ
Check dilation

A RESIDENT examines her and declares

RESIDENT
Seven or eight centimeters

DOCTOR VELEZ
Frequency

The RESIDENT checks on the cardiac rhythm with a Pinard
stethoscope while a nurse fills out papers

RESIDENT
I can’t hear the foetal focus

NURSE
Blow ma’am

RESIDENT
She’s full She’s in second
plane expulsive with full
dilation and there is four cross
meconium and asystole

Doctor Vélez gives a round of instructions -

DOCTOR VELEZ
Plug in mixed solution at 5 and
wheel her into Labor immediately
Alert pediatrics Prepare a
laryngoscope reanimation equipment
and an ambu

The nurses quickly bring a gurney up to the gynecological
table The resident asks Cleo -

RESIDENT
Can you climb onto the gurney for
me

DOCTOR VELEZ
Let’s get your baby out

The nurses help Cleo move onto the gurney

INT - HALLWAY - LABOR ROOMS - 6TH FLOOR - OBGYN - DUSK

Fluorescent lights in a hallway with half-open frosted doors
The cries of a woman giving brith filter out from one of the

labor rooms

A nurse comes out of one of the rooms and goes into another

At the end of the hallway we also hear a door opening and

soon after Doctor Vélez and her team of nurses and residents

appear pushing Cleo on her gurney

When they reach the end of the hallway they turn and enter -

INT - BIRTHING ROOM - OPERATING ROOM - OBGYN - DUSK

Nurses and residents work around Cleo who moans in pain They

put her on the birthing bed while Doctor Vélez washes her
hands

INTERN
Rubén Lefiero’s colleague is telling
me that they’ve hospitalized
injured students and some Halcones
came in to kill them off inside the
very hospital

A nurse fixes Cleo’s feet onto the braces Doctor Vélez sits

in front of her legs to deliver the baby
Cleo has a strong contraction -

CLEO
Aaaaaaaahhhhhh

DOCTOR VELEZ
Dont blow Cleo Push

Cleo tries blowing in the middle of her cries of pain A
doctor comes in the door accompanied by a nurse who wheels
a cart with medical equipment It’s the PEDIATRICIAN

Cleo breathes agitated And from between her legs the
baby’s crown appears like a rising sun

DOCTOR VELEZ (CONT’D)
Almost there Push

in

Cleo screams

CLEO
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh

It’s a deep cry A primeval scream from time immemorial

CLEO (CONT’D)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh

The baby is expelled between Cleo’s legs and onto the hands
of Doctor Vélez who receives it The baby doesn’t cry or
breathe It is flaccid and hangs like a rag It’s completely
smeared in green liquid

Doctor Vélez cuts the umbilical chord and passes the baby
over to the pediatrician who places it softly on his
pediatric table and checks on it with a Pinard stethoscope

Cleo follows all the action the pediatric table only a yard
away from her face

PEDIATRICIAN
No heart beat We’ll try
reanimation

The pediatrician places the baby in hyperflexed position and
puts the laryngoscope down its mouth He begins aspiration
with a catheter

Cleo sees her baby From its mouth through the catheter
meconium comes out a green dense liquid like pea soup

The pediatrician pulls the catheter out of the baby’s mouth
and places the “ambu” a manual resuscitator on the baby’s
mouth and nose Doctor Vélez is working on the placenta
expulsion

Cleo watches the baby on the table The Pediatrician pumps
the “ambu” balloon repeatedly attempting to reanimate the
baby

Cleo looks at the baby its face almost entirely covered by
the “ambu” and finds out it’s a girl

The Pediatrician stops pumping the “ambu” and checks for a
heartbeat with the stethoscope -

PEDIATRICIAN (CONT’D)
Still asystole

And he walks over softly to Cleo

PEDIATRICIAN (CONT’D)
Maam I am afraid you’re baby is
stillborn She had no amniotic
liquid And the green liquid
blocked her lungs I am so sorry
senora

Cleo listens in silence unable to take her eyes off her
baby The nurses start cleaning off its tiny body

DOCTOR VELEZ
I am so sorry Cleo

PEDIATRICIAN
Would you like to say good bye to
your baby maam

Cleo nods The nurses carry the baby and place it quietly on
Cleo who hugs it her gaze lost Doctor Vélez keeps working
between her legs cleaning her

PEDIATRICIAN (CONT’D)
Who are you with Can we call
someone

DOCTOR VELEZ
She’s with family They’re outside

Cleo whispers something

DOCTOR VELEZ (CONT’D)
Did you say something Cleo I
couldn’t hear you

CLEO
(whispering)
Senora Sofia Senora Sofia

DOCTOR VELEZ
Yes Cleo I will give her a
call

The nurses come to take the dead baby -

NURSE
May I Maam

Cleo nods and the nurse takes the baby over to a small table
where they wrap her in a cloth

Cleo watches as her baby girl disappears under the sheath
and when she is completely wrapped the nurse seals the cloth
with adhesive tape

The nurse takes a marker and writes on the sheath -

NEWBORN - CLEODEGARIA GUTIERREZ

Friday June 11 1971

The light of a new day floods the room Beds in a row along
the walls mothers who have recently given birth are resting

Some women carry their babies Others breastfeed Some sleep
There are bows envelopes flowers

Cleo is awake lying in bed Her gaze is absent

A nurse carries a baby up to a bed A woman holds it
excitedly and begins to breastfeed The nurse helps her both
of them whisper effusively interrupting the peace in the
room

Cleo doesn’t turn to look at them or perhaps she can’t hear
them her gaze is lost

Sefora Sofia comes to the door and stops for a moment She
watches Cleo who is motionless surrounded by the low hum of
barely awakened traffic from Avenida Cuauhtémoc and the
breastfeeding woman’s effusive whispers

Sefiora Sofia comes into the hall and walks towards Cleo She
sits on the bed and holds her hand Cleo looks at her and
attempts a feeble smile

Sefora Sofia squeezes her hand as her wounded heart tries to
offer solid support that Cleo can’t find in the void

INTEXT - GALAXIE 500 - BAJA CALIFORNIA AVE - URES AND
HUATABAMPO CROSSTREETS - TONALA - DAY

Sefora Sofia is driving Next to her Cleo They are silent
They turn right leaving Baja California Ave behind and with
it the sun

They drive down Ures both look straight ahead surrounded by
the purr of eight cylinders changing gears automatically

They turn left onto Huatabampo streets They continue in
silence under the shade of the houses until they reach the
corner with Tonala where a car waits its turn to turn

Sefiora Sofia breaks behind the car and waits The two women
look ahead in silence Sefiora Sofia holds Cleo’s hand and
starts bawling

It’s a quiet and prolonged wail that breaks into a long and
articulate lament She hugs Cleo who is still silent

The car in front of them has moved and now the GALAXIE holds
up the traffic three cars waiting behind it already A HORN
honks

Sefiora Sofia cries while hugging Cleo She cries out all the
impotence all the fear all the uncertainty and all the
humiliation She cries ignoring the chorus of horns that has
joined her lament

EXT- CORNER OF HUATABAMPO AND TONALA - DAY

The Galaxie 500 is motionless and stops traffic at the
corner Impatiently cars go around it on the left some of

them protesting rudely

The two women inside the Galaxie continue to hug

EXT- PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

Littered with dog shit the patio is empty except for a red
tricycle a football and Borras enjoying the last few rays

of sun

A mysterious WHISTLE filters in from the distance Alert
Borras lifts his head

The sad and solitary whistle invokes a presence invading the
walls of the house

In the patio Borras begins to bark

EXT - TEPEJI STREET - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

The whistle pierces through the afternoon quiet and seems to
bounce off the facades of the houses

Sad and defeated Tepeji 21 rests on its solid ground which
blends with the grey concrete of the sidewalk

The Galaxie 500 and the Valiant are parked in front of the
house
A KNIFE SHARPENER crosses on his bike blowing on his
whistle suffusing the air with its ominous lament
EXT - SMALL PATIO - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

The parakeets seem to want to imitate the whistle with their
song Adela’s voice calls from the second floor -

ADELA (0C)
Move it
INT - KITCHEN - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

Cleo is sitting next to the window wrapped up in her own
pain

ADELA (0C)
It’s the sharpener Move it Cleo

But Cleo remains motionless

The fateful whistle fades away slowly and disappears
Borras and the parakeets calm down

Everything is in silence

The afternoon light abates

Cleo doesn’t move

TA-TA TA-TA TA-TA TA-TAAAAAAA

A car’s nasal horn resounds on the street and Borras replies
with his barks

TA-TA TA-TA TA-TA TA-TAAAAAAA

Cleo does not recognize the sound of the horn but its rhythm -

TA-TA TA-TA TA-TA TA-TAAAAAAA
Cleo gets up and slowly walks out the door to the -
SMALL PATIO -

She crosses out onto -

EXT - PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

Cleo watches Adela open the street door while she grabs
Borras by the collar She discovers -

A PALE YELLOW RENAULT 21 parked in front of the door It revs
and pulls in easily crossing the doorframe and continuing
its way up to the hallway door

Paco and Pepe peek out from the hall and see their mother at
the wheel of the Renault Paco cries out -

PACO
Tono Sofi Come

PEPE
Mom bought a new car

Paco comes out to examine the car’s body Pepe joins his
brother Cleo comes closer while Adela closes the door that
leads to the street

Sefora Sofia pokes her head out of the car window -

SENORA SOFIA
You like it

PACO
How fast can it go

Sefora Sofia opens the door and comes out -

SENORA SOFIA

Paco hurries to sit in the driver’s seat Pepe runs around to
the other side and sits in the passenger seat

Tofio and Sofi come out to the patio to see the new car

TONO
Why not a Maverick

From the driver’s seat Paco protests -

PACO

Sofi comes out of the car -

SOFI

Senora Sofia looks at Cleo -

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)

Cleo barely nods

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)

siblings into the hall

SOFI

lights of the house switching on and Sefiora Sofia crossing
the hall up to the stairs Paco and Pepe cross the hall
following their mother

PACO
It’s the beach

SENORA SOFIA
Yes

TONO
The beach in Veracruz is so ugly

Sefiora Sofia climbs the stairs the four children follow her

Out on the patio Cleo watches the family disappear into the

EXT - ROADSIDE BEACH - AFTERNOON

The Galaxie pulls up next to the sands of a long grey
overcast beach empty except for the stunted skeleton of a
brick building

The family comes out of the car

Toho and Paco immediately run to the shore taking off their
shirts and pants and throwing them on the sand Sofi and Pepe
follow behind

Sefiora Sofia takes off her shoes and follows her children
picking up the clothes strewn about on the sand

Cleo walks to the shore where the children splash around She
is absent

A gust of wind drags the breeze over to caress her face Cleo
breathes in the sea and closes her eyes She breathes in as
if wanting to cleanse something very deep

EXT - GARDEN - BUNGALOWS -TUXPAN - DUSK

The fading light of day strokes the garden with soft
coolness An orchard surrounds the bungalows built in the
1940s their paint now nibbled on by time and saltpeter

A RECEPTIONIST carrying keys guides Sefiora Sofia Cleo and
the children through the garden They all carry bags The
receptionist opens the door

INT - ROOM - BUNGALOW - TUXPAN - DUSK

The sky’s last light attempts to paint the windows but is
defeated by the lightbulb inside a wicker lamp which lights
the small room with two beds

Cleo sits on one of the beds and putting Pepe’s T-shirt on
as he stands in front of her with his arms up in the air
When his head pokes out the collar Pepe looks at her
surprised -

PEPE
Cat got your tongue

Cleo shakes her head no

PEPE (CONT’D)
Then why don’t you talk

Cleo smiles with a smile that holds back tears and walks
him out of the room to a -

INT - LIVING ROOM - BUNGALOW - TUXPAN - DUSK

Another wicker lamp hangs in the middle of the little dining
room and two lamps on each side of the sofa one without a
shade light the room

Toho is tying knots with a string while Sefiora Sofia is
applying vinegar on Paco’s back with a cotton ball

PACO
Ay Ay Ay

SENORA SOFIA
I told you to put on your T-shirt

PACO
But it was cloudy

SENORA SOFIA

That’s why The glare is worse than
the sun

Next to him crying and crying Sofi waits her turn

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
Are you dressed Pepe

PEPE
Yes but the cat got Cleo’s tongue

Sefiora Sofia smiles Cleo sits on the sofa and grabs a cotton
ball douses it in vinegar comes close to Sofi and starts
applying it on her back

Cleo and Sefora Sofia swab wet cotton balls over Sofi and
Paco’s backs Sofi won’t stop crying but Cleo’s gaze is
absent

INT - RESTAURANT - TUXPAN - NIGHT

Hand-drawn illustrations of each dish and a stuffed sailfish
decorate the walls of a family restaurant Romantic music
pours out of a rockola accompanying the hum of the
fluorescent lights

The family’s finishing dinner Cleo cuts Sofi and Pepe’s
meat They’re wearing pajamas already Tofo has finished and
is tying his knots

SENORA SOFIA
Children

But the children are distracted

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
Children

She finally gets her children’s attention

SENORA SOFIA (CONT’D)
Pay attention I have something to
tell you

The children look at her expectantly Sefiora Sofia hesitates
gathers her courage and -

SENORA SOFIA (CONT’D)
Your dad’s not in Ottawa

SOFI
Is he back

SENORA SOFIA
No Your dad never went anywhere

The children look at her she’s seems confused

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
Well yes But he only went for a
week and your father’s not
coming back home

The children watch her in silence Tofo and Paco are
interested Sofi and Pepe are confused

The song ends and the rockola digests another coin expelling
a new lament

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
We came on this trip so he could
come get his things from the house

PACO
What things

SENORA SOFIA
His things Or what he says are his
things His clothes the
bookshelves

PACO
Are you getting a divorce

SENORA SOFIA
He says he doesn’t know

Sofi starts to cry

SOFI
He doesn’t love us anymore

SENORA SOFIA
Dad loves you very much He says he
wants to see you

TONO
When

SENORA SOFIA
He says he doesn’t know when
Soon

Sofi muffles her cries in Cleo’s breast Tofio looks at the
fan and Paco plays with his beans Only Pepe is still looking
at his mother still confused

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
There will be many changes but
well be together and it’1l be an
adventure

Pepe rests his head on Cleo

SENORA SOFIA (CONT’D)
I’m starting a new full time job in
publishing next week

TONO
Publishing But you’re a chemist

SENORA SOFIA
I know but your father hasn’t sent
any money yet and teaching high
school is not enough Plus I love
books and I never liked chemistry
It’ll be another adventure

But the children don’t look very convinced They still don’t
know this but this moment will be etched into their memories
as fragments of images smells sounds and textures -

The food stains on the table the paintings on the walls the
landscape of beans smashed by the fork on a plate

The song ends

EXT - STREET - TUXPAN - NIGHT

The family roams around the streets Quiet Lost in thought

Sunday June 27 1971

EXT - PALAPA - TUXPAN BEACH - DAY

The sun bears down on the afternoon beaming down on the
waves and the burning sand on the empty beach The waves
follow one after another incessantly dragging their foam
till they caress the sand without ever breaking

A palapa shelters the family under its shade and its cool
sand

Paco and Pepe bury Sofi in the sand sculpting long legs to
which they add tennis shoes instead of feet

Sefiora Sofia reads a book sitting on a folding cloth chair
and Tofio reads a Flash comic lying down on a hammock swaying
in the wind

At the edge of the shade Cleo is sitting on a chair
hypnotized by the rhythm of the waves and the foam melting as
it touches the sand

Time trickles by slowly
EXT - TUXPAN BEACH - AFTERNOONDUSK

The yellow end-of-the-afternoon light dances with the wind
caressing surfaces softly

Paco and Sofi play in the waves jumping over them swimming
under them or resisting heroically on foot

In her dress Cleo stands next to Pepe who is digging holes
tunnels and roads in the sand too

Sefora Sofia comes in to the edge followed by Tofio who stops
halfway Paco and Sofi come out of the water running -

PACO
Are you going to come in

SENORA SOFIA
I have to go check on the tires
since we’re leaving tomorrow early
You coming

PACO
No It’s our last day at the beach

SOFI
I’m staying too

SENORA SOFIA
But if I leave you can’t go in If
something happens Cleo can’t swim

PACO
But it’s so mellow

SENORA SOFIA
I don’t care If you want to stay
those are the rules

PACO
Not even by the edge

SENORA SOFIA
By the edge is fine But just here
understood

PACO AND SOFI
Yes

PEPE
Me too

SENORA SOFIA
Yes but right by the shore

Senora Sofia looks at Cleo

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
Can I leave them with you I won’t
take long

Cleo simply nods and watches Sefiora Sofia walk back with Tofo
to the Galaxie 500 parked behind the palapa

In the background the sun has lost its shine and peeks out
red and roundly from between the clouds

Paco and Sofi go back to the water Pepe follows

CLEO
Just right by the shore

Paco and Sofi run to the edge splashing around with their
feet getting Pepe wet

PEPE
Aaaah

Paco and Sofi kick more water around to get Pepe wet he runs
away but falls on dry sand Cleo runs to him and picks him
up he’s crying She tries to brush off the thousands of
grains of sand sticking to his damp skin

Paco takes advantage of the distraction and goes in deeper
Sofi begins to follow in after him when Cleo sees them -

CLEO
Paco Just in the shallow water
Sofi

Sofi obeys Paco comes back to the shore too
Cleo takes Pepe’s hand and they walk back to the palapa
together As they step on warmer sand Pepe stops holds his

arms up

PEPE
Carry me

CLEO
No way You can do it alone It’s
not hot anymore

She looks to the shore -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Paco I see you Back to the shore

PACO (0C)
But we’re at the shore

CLEO
Come closer You heard your mother
if you don’t come in you have to
get out

She waits and when she’s satisfied she keeps walking

Arms still up in the air Pepe watches her go and throws
himself on the sand

Cleo barely looks -

CLEO (CONTD)
Suit yourself You’re just getting
more sand on you and I was going to
clean you up in the palapa

She keeps walking Pepe gets up crusty with sand and
hurries to catch up

They reach the palapa and Pepe sits on a chair Cleo starts
dusting him off with a clean towel She looks to the sea -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Hey I’m watching you guys

Cleo waits for the children to come back to shallow water and
keeps cleaning Pepe

PEPE
Did you know when I was grown up I
was a sailor

CLEO
Mmmhmmm

PEPE
Yes and I drowned in a storm

CLEO
Mmmhmmm

She gets up and looks out to sea -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Paco and Sofi Closer

Cleo keeps watching -

PEPE
But the waves were so big

CLEO
Get back

She walks to the edge of the palapa and stops to wait next to
a post -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Closer

PEPE
And it was night and there was so
much lightning and I didn’t know
how to swim

Without taking her eyes from the waves Cleo starts walking
towards the shore

CLEO
Stay there Pepe

The sun has vanished behind the mountain and the purple sky
is laden with black clouds The wind picks up the sand and
makes new waves that crash arrogantly into the old ones

Cleo stops -

CLEO (CONTD)
Help your sister

Behind her Pepe comes closer Cleo sees him -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Pepe I told you to stay there

Chided Pepe goes back to the palapa
Scared now Cleo looks at the sea and looks around but the

beach is deserted Only a man on a horse far away and some
people walking in the distance She hurries to the shore

As she reaches the edge she walks fearfully in the water
that moves back and forth and crashes around her legs
soaking her polyester dress

She looks impotently at the waves which Paco and Sofi
wrestle insignificant in a fierce and indifferent ocean that
drags them further in

Cleo tries to move closer to the children fighting to keep
her balance in the choppy waters reaching her waist

The wind plays with the crests of the dark waves and the
dense clouds are charged with tension in an ever darkening
sky

Cleo looks out to the beach but the man on the horse and the
people are still very far away and she resigns herself to
going deeper

A wave crashes over the children’s heads When it passes
Sofi reemerges but she can barely take a breath when another
waves comes crashing over her

Other waves cross and crash up to the sky

Cleo fights desperately to stay on her feet in the midst of
the cross-current chaos enveloping her without failing to
look straight in front of her-

Where the waves crash rising up and yet others take their
place the little heads don’t emerge

Another wave powers up and a little head bobs up in front of
her it’s Sofi taking up air and Paco resurfaces too

He turns to look and sizes up the wave grabs his sister and
swims with the break to the beach but the wave catches up
with them pulling them down

Cleo comes close but is pushed back by the waves In front of
her the little heads reemerge Paco tries to repeat the move
and pushes Sofi to the front but the water envelops them

It also envelops Cleo but doesn’t drag her out She pushes
towards Sofi who tries to swim to her Cleo reaches her body
out to get her and as she pulls her in her feet lose contact
with the bottom and the two go under

Another wave galloping with foam And behind it Cleo emerges
carrying Sofi Paco swims behind them

At the beach a group of people gathers and with them the
man on the horse

Cleo carries Sofi and finally manages to reach shallower
waters Paco follows a little further behind A couple of
young guys run towards them but they don’t help they just
look

Carrying Sofi Cleo reaches the shore and collapses on the
beach Paco next to her Sofi coughs and Cleo hugs her on her
lap

Curious onlookers surround them and behind them Sefiora
Sofia followed by Tofo come running from the palapa

Cleo cleans sand off of Sofi’s face and starts crying She
cries and hugs Sofi who is also crying and rocks with her
Cleo hugs her as if her life depended on it

Senora Sofia throws herself on the sand next to Cleo and
yanks Sofi from her Sofi hugs her mom Paco comes to them
and hugs them both

Toho watches next to the bystanders and next to him Pepe
looks scared

Sefiora Sofia checks on Sofi -

SENORA SOFIA
Are you OK my love

Sofi nods -

SOFI
Cleo saved us

The recent emotion pushes more tears Sefiora Sofi looks at
Cleo who is crying inconsolably It’s a deep and painful cry
a cry that washes it all away
Sefiora Sofia hugs her mightily -
SENORA SOFIA
Thank you thank you thank you
Cleo
But Cleo can’t stop crying -
CLEO
I didn’t want her I didn’t want

her

Sefiora Sofia tries to calm her -

SENORA SOFIA
Shhh shhh shhh They’re OK The
kids are OK

But Cleo insists amidst tears and snot -

CLEO
I didn’t want her I didn’t want
her to be born

She breaks down completely -

CLEO (CONT’D)

Poor little girl I didn’t want
her to be born I didn’t want
her to be born

SENORA SOFIA
It’s going to be all right Cleo
It’s going to be all right

The two women cry hugging It’s a shared cry with sobs like
retching and long silences exploding in prolonged vocals

The children close in on the women hugging them Only Tofio
watches standing by

The onlookers scatter The rider pulls the reins and the
horse continues its way down the beach

The furious sea and its restless waves reflect the last
glimmers of the day

EXT - PUEBLA FREEWAY - AFTERNOON

Fields spotted with clouds spread out between green hills
Further behind the volcanos show off their snowy peaks

The Galaxie 500 drives on tiny on the road crossing the
landscape

INTEXT - GALAXIE 500 - PUEBLA FREEWAY -AFTERNOON

Sefiora Sofia is driving and her index finger is calm Next
to her Tofio looks out the window without looking at the
landscape In the rear Paco also lets the landscape slide by
his lost gaze

Sofi is hugging Cleo who carries a sleeping Pepe on her lap

The family rides in silence

EXT - FREEWAY ENTRANCE TO THE CITY - AFTERNOON
Mexico City extends out to the distance

The Galaxie 500 drives on heavy with uncertainty

EXT - HOUSE - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

The house rests patiently resigned to enjoy the last rays of
sun

The Jr high marching band turns the corner and heads into
the street with its martial drums and trumpets

The Galaxie 500 pulls into the street and follows the band’s
read guard until it parks in front of the house Tofio
immediately opens the door and stretches out on the street

Pepe comes out after him running to the door holding his
privates and ringing the doorbell Borras answers by barking

Sefora Sofia comes out of the car and opens the trunk Sofi
comes out after her Cleo comes out last and heads to the
trunk as well

Adela opens the door holding Borras by the collar Pepe runs
through the door and rushes in

INT - DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

The afternoon sun still pierces the windows obliquely and

streaks the living room shadows with its light Outside the
family is on the sidewalk -

CLEO
Tie the dog

SENORA SOFIA
You too kids Don’t play dumb and
come help us with the things

The children who were already walking up to the house stop
and come back to help begrudgingly

Inside the skylight lights the stairs but barely touches the
tiles in the hall Pepe bursts in from the patio and runs to
the bathroom that is under the stairs goes in shuts the
door

Adela crosses through the windows that open to the patio
dragging Borras by the collar She listens to the jet in the
toilet

Inside the house waits It seems to have grown larger The
absence of the bookshelves has left towers of books piled on
the floor and a seeming emptiness

Toho comes in carrying his things He’s rushing but stops in
the middle of the hall surprised by the space-it seems new
Paco comes in right after and stops next to his brother

Sefiora Sofia walks in with Sofi The toilet flushes and Tofio
reaches his verdict -

TONO
It’s horrible It’s horrible
without the bookshelves

PACO
I like it better this way

Toho runs up the stairs

TONO
It’s awful

Paco follows after him Pepe comes out of the bathroom and
follows his mother and Sofi up the stairs -

SOFI
What’s so horrible mommy

SENORA SOFIA
He doesn’t like the hallway without
the bookshelves

SOFI
What bookshelves

SENORA SOFIA
The ones that used to be in the
hall

SOFI
Oh You’re right

PEPE
Wow It looks bigger

SENORA SOFIA
What did you think about our
adventure

SOFI
I liked it a lot

Sefora Sofia and the children disappear upstairs where the
television is already on

Outside on the patio Cleo walks carrying three bags and
runs into Adela who is back without the dog

ADELA
I’m going to the store there’s no
ham How was it then

CLEO
Real pretty Go I’1ll tell you
about it later

Adela continues on her way out Cleo comes into the hall
Crosses and goes up the stairs carrying the luggage

From upstairs Pepe exclaims -

PEPE (0S)
The desk is gone too

INT UPSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

Cleo makes it up to the hall and leaves the luggage on the
floor The family has begun to take over the spaces -

Pepe sits next to Paco who is already in front of the
television

SENORA SOFIA

And well travel a lot

PACO
Well go to Dinseyland

Toho puts stuff away in a drawer in his room and Sofi goes to
her room to grab a doll Senora Sofia goes to Cleo takes one
of the bags and puts it in her room -

SENORA SOFIA
We don’t have enough money

Cleo takes the other bag to Tono and Paco’s room Tono comes
out and sits in the armchair in front of the television

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
But we can go on adventures in the
car What if we went to a ghost
mining town in the desert

PEPE
And there’s ghosts

Paco gets up following his mother into her room -

PACO
No silly That’s what you call
towns that are abandoned And
what’s over there

Cleo comes out of Tofio’s room carrying a load of laundry and
drops it next to the stairs

Senhora Sofia comes out of her room followed by Paco The
phone rings

SENORA SOFIA
Nothing Just the town and the
abandoned mine Or we could go to
the Lacandon jungle or Oaxaca

SOFI
Oaxaca Yes And we could visit
Cleo’s village

Sefiora Sofia comes back to the hall and sits in the couch
next to Pepe and Sofi who takes up the other spot

PACO

SOFI
Finders keepers

Cleo picks up

CLEO
Hello Yes thank you ma’am Yes

She lowers the phone and calls out -

CLEO (CONTD)

Sefiora Sofia gets up calming the children -

SENORA SOFIA

She goes up to the phone -

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)

Cleo gathers the dirty laundry into a pile Pepe calls from
the couch -

PEPE

CLEO

phone conversation -

SENORA SOFIA

SENORA SOFIA (CONTD)
Well Paco and Sofi scared the
living daylights out of me

INT - DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

Cleo goes down the stairs carrying her pile of clothes the
family conversations and television filter down from
upstairs

As she reaches downstairs she crosses the empty hallway and
the breakfast room She goes into the kitchen and out the
back

EXT - SMALL PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

The patio in shadows now floats in the afternoon quiet
Borras sleeps and the parakeets are quiet Only the hum of
the city in the distance

Cleo comes out of the kitchen carrying her load of dirty
laundry and crosses the tiny patio to go up the metal
staircase that leads to the roof

Her steps reverberate throughout the bony structure in a
metallic moan that echoes through the tiny patio waking the
caged birds

Cleo reaches the step in front of her room and keeps walking
upwards A sweet potato vendor lets out his sad howl in the
distance

Step by step Cleo ascends

Yet further up beyond the roof the sky is pure
