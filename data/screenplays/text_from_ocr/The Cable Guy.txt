image of a television program Every few moments the channel changes
revealing a new ghostly

image

from a twenty seven inch

The camera pulls back some more and we see a mans hand enter frame
holding a remote
control The hand changes channels frantically

The camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN

Well look who decided to show up I was

The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit and is extremely
confident despite the fact that he
speaks with a slight lisp This lisp gives him a child-like quality

13 INT - STEVENS LIVING ROOM - LATER
CLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION
RIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio

RIKKI KLIEMAN

(to camera)

So ends day fifty-four of the trial of
former child star Sam Sweet who has been
accused of shooting his twin brother
Stan in cold blood The twins were
stars of the hit sitcom Double Trouble
which aired from nineteen seventy-seven
till nineteen eighty-four

A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and
his twin brother at

various ages Included is the cast photo of Double Trouble Pictured
in the photo are eight-year-

old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad

We see a brief clip from Double Trouble
year-old boys then a shot of

Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs

starring the two eight-

RIKKI KLIEMAN

(to camera)

Life wasnt so sweet after the cancellation
of their program Hollywood chewed them
up and spit them out A frustrated Sam
turned to petty larceny while his more
impressionable brother Stan fell in
with a fringe cult called The
Brotherhood of Friends Reduced to
tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside
of Sam A burning need to be recognized
as an individual not a person famous for
having an identical twin A need that
took the form of four shotgun blasts on
the night of November fourteenth And so
today his attorneys continue the unusual
defense of Twin Envy

ANGLE ON
Steven re-enters the room The Cable Guy is watching television

STEVEN
Hows it going

The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say quiet His eyes never

leave the TV

CABLE GUY
Guilty guilty guilt-freakin-tee I
hope they fry this bastard

Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in
a fashion which makes the

room impractical for anything other than watching television The TV
is now on the stairs

blocking the entrance into the living room All furniture faces the
TV making conversation

impossible

STEVEN
(looks around)
What happened

CABLE GUY

(jumps to his feet)

The arrangement of your major appliances
and your furniture was causing some noisy
pics and hum bars in your reception I
moved a few things Cleared it right up
Is that cool

STEVEN
(non-confrontational)
I guess so

CABLE GUY

You programmed

(off of Stevens look)

Then let me slave your remotes

He picks up Stevens remotes punches in a complicated series of
commands then points them at
each other As he holds them together he makes a face as if their
power is surging through him

CABLE GUY
Ooh maybe we should leave these two
alone

STEVEN
So after this Ill only need one remote
for everything

CABLE GUY
You know youre pretty good at this You
could be a cable guy yourself

(he finishes)

Now let me check your levels

With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting sound controls closed
captioned etc Then he

clicks through the channels A music video documentary on Hitler
Oprah Winfrey Show starving

kids Barney court TV The Cable Guy watches emotionless

CABLE GUY

All right That about does it I just
have some paperwork for you to fill out
Sign here

Steven does

CABLE GUY

That gave me power of attorney over you
(beat)

Joking

Steven laughs The Cable Guy joins him but then continues to laugh
way too hard for way too

long As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment The
Cable Guy does not want

to leave

CABLE GUY

Im about finished here
(beat)

Okay I feel good about this

Cable Guy walks to the door

STEVEN
One thing

CABLE GUY
(turns back immediately)
Yeah

STEVEN

I uh I have this friend and he said

he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he
got free movie channels Have you ever
heard of anything like that

CABLE GUY
(deadly serious)
You mean illegal cable
STEVEN
Uh yes

CABLE GUY
Who told you that I want his name

STEVEN
Forget it

CABLE GUY

Youre offering me a bribe What you

have just done is illegal and in this
state if convicted you could be fined
five-thousand dollars or spend six months
in a correctional facility

STEVEN
Please that was dumb I was just
making conversation -

CABLE GUY

(laughs)

Im just jerking your chain Wake up
little snoozy Ill juice you up All
it is is a push of a button

He puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door

STEVEN
Oh great How much

CABLE GUY

you Your girl just booted you
Consider it one guy doing another guy a
solid

STEVEN
That is so nice

CABLE GUY

Hey youre a nice guy Youd be
surprised how many customers treat you

something

(hands him a card)

just for my preferred customers Never

hold
STEVEN

STEVEN
(guilty)

On the flip side

The Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider Steven cannot
believe he just got roped into

that

home The facility has two tennis courts
an Olympic size pool and full gym witha
stage if the residents decide they want
to perform Oklahoma

STEVEN

The kitsch appeal of living in an old
schoolhouse should be very attractive to
young upwardly mobile home buyers And
most important the structure is
available in foreclosure If we put down
a cash bid were going to steal this
thing

There is a pause then everyone applauds Mr

Steven and puts a proud arm

Daniels walks over to

CABLE GUY
Howdy partner Climb aboard

Steven gets in
19 INT VAN - CONTINUOUS
The van drives onto the main boulevard

CABLE GUY

that comes out of the wall They never
take the time to understand how it works

STEVEN
Where exactly are we goin

CABLE GUY
Were going to take a ride on the
information superhighway

20 EXT CITY - DUSK

Birds eye POV shot follows the Cable Guys van as it drives
through the city

CABLE GUY

It all started in Lansford

Pennsylvania where Panther Valley
Television with the assistance of Jerrod
Electronics created the first cable
television system

The van drives up into the hills finally revealing a huge satellite
dish on top of a small mountain
overlooking the entire city

CABLE GUY
I went to Lansford once Its the Cable
Guys Mecca It was very emotional
21 EXT WOODED AREA - DUSK
Steven and the Cable Guy get out of the van and walk down a trail

CABLE GUY
I come here to think sometimes To clear
my head

They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them
It is enormous Next to it is a

one-hundred and fifty foot antenna Next to that is a small fenced-in
shack where the satellites

controls are located

CABLE GUY

There she is Right now shes sending
entertainment and information to millions
of satisfied citizens

STEVEN
Thats pretty impressive

CABLE GUY
See I knew the moment I met you that
you would appreciate this

The Cable Guy runs to the dish A few seconds later he appears inside
of it

CABLE GUY

(with wonder)

The future is now Soon every American
home will integrate their television
phone and computer Youll be able to
visit the Louvre on one channel and
watch female mud wrestling on

another You can do your shopping at

in Vietnam Theres no end to the
possibilities

The Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish looking
up at the night sky

CABLE GUY

Sometimes Ill sit here and imagine that
there are billions of bits of information
surging through me
STEVEN
Ive watched a lot of TV in my life I
guess Ive always taken it for granted

CABLE GUY

When I was a kid my mom worked nights
Never met dad But the old TV was always
there for me

STEVEN

I know what you mean My dad was there
but he might as well have been gone My
mom is a stewardess She was always out
of town

CABLE GUY

abandonment issues Reality isnt Father

So youre pretty love struck about your
lady huh

STEVEN
I miss her I asked her to marry me and
she asked me to move out

CABLE GUY
I hate that
STEVEN
She said she felt pressured Can you
believe that

CABLE GUY

Women are a labyrinth Can I be frank I
dont think you listen to her I think
you try to tell her what she wants to
hear She wants you to thirst for
knowledge about who she is All the
complicated splendor that is woman When
your love is truly giving it will come
back to you ten-fold

STEVEN
Youre right That is remarkably
insightful

CABLE GUY
Yeah it was Jerry Springers final

TABITHA SOREN

Hmm Who indeed Coming up next a rare
interview with Michael Jacksons zoo-
keeper

25 INT HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY

Steven is playing a pick-up full court basketball game with some of
his friends It is a competitive
but friendly game Steven is on skins Rick is on shirts

STEVEN
Here here here

A player passes to Steven Rick is covering him Steven drives to the
basket and puts in a lay up

RICK
(to himself)
Shit My fault My fault

STEVEN
Not your fault Im in the zone There
is no stopping me today

Play begins again A player named JEFF takes the ball out then passes
to a heavy-set player who

catches the ball then drives to the basket When he does he twists
his ankle dropping the ball The

ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym We follow it
as it rolls on the ground until it

hits a mans sneaker A pair of hands pick up the ball The camera
tilts up the mans body It is the

Cable Guy He is holding another ball He starts dribbling the two
balls in a circular pattern

CABLE GUY
Hey you guys play here too Cool I
was just in the neighborhood Thought Id
run the court for a couple of innings

RICK
(gestures to injured player)
Great We need another man

STEVEN
This is Chip Douglas my cable guy

Rick smiles in recognition

CABLE GUY

We met about a week ago during a routine
installation but I feel like Ive known
him my whole life

Steven cant believe this is happening

RICK
Oh really Thats sweet All right Chip
Douglas youre on shirts Lets play

CABLE GUY
No I want to be on Stevens team Im

The Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt Steven looks shocked
because underneath his clothes he

is rippled with muscles The dichotomy between his nerdy face and his
awesome physique is

scary

JEFF
I dont care Ill be shirts Lets just
play

CABLE GUY
Wait a sec Ive got to warm up

The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court touching
all the main lines Everyone
stares at him until he finishes

CABLE GUY
Lets get it on

STEVEN
Are you any good

CABLE GUY
Feed me under the boards and youll find
out

Play begins The shirts inbound to Jeff The Cable Guy is all over
him covering him as tightly as

humanly possible He keeps his hands near Jeffs face whacks him in
the back as he dribbles etc

He couldnt be more annoying Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the
basket and puts up a shot

which goes in Rick and Jeff slap hands

CABLE GUY
(doing the traveling hand signal)
Traveling Thats traveling

RICK
Yeah whatever you say Chip

Everyone runs down the court ignoring him

CABLE GUY
All right so were playing that type of
game Prison rules I get it

Steven takes the ball out The cable Guy runs around the court
attempting to get open He criss
crosses all over the court

CABLE GUY
Feed me the rock Feed me the rock Im
open

Steven passes to the Cable Guy who drives to the basket pushing Jeff
out of the way in the
process The ball goes in

CABLE GUY

(does the foul hand signal)

And one Thats definitely a foul

(to Jeff)

You want to mug me my wallet is in my
other pants

STEVEN
(to Cable Guy)

to the floor Rick scores

The Cable guy helps Steven up As the Cable Guy walks across the court
he bangs shoulders

with Rick

d The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven then sets a nasty pick
against Rick who goes down

hard

CABLE GUY
Take it to the hole

Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guys behavior that he misses a
simple lay up Steven grabs

his own rebound When he puts up a second shot Rick gently fouls him
Steven stumbles to the

ground The ball does not go in

CABLE GUY
Hey are you okay

He pulls Steven up

STEVEN
Yeah Im fine

CABLE GUY
Lets switch Ill cover Rick

The cable Guy gets in Ricks face and gives him a death stare

Steven takes out the ball He passes to a teammate who passes it to
the Cable Guy who drives to

the basket then literally steps on Ricks back and leaps into the air
and dunks the ball

RICK

(enraged)

What the hell was that Thats it Ive
had enough

Everyone begins to exit the court

JEFF
Thanks for bringing your friend
The Cable Guy runs up to Rick

CABLE GUY

Good game

(slaps Rick on the butt)

You were tough out there Your play

that

RICK

(dismissive)
Yeah

He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players

STEVEN
What are you doing

CABLE GUY
It was payback time I was protecting
you

(Revised 111495 - Pink)

The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five Steven slaps
it halfheartedly Then the
cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee

CABLE GUY
And down low

Steven stares at it for a beat The cable Guy waits Hell wait as
long as it takes Finally Steven

(embarrassed)

Hey it should be starting

They sit on the couch Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven Steven
turns on the television The

screen is filled with white noise The sound is loud static He
changes channels looking for the

signal Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower
the volume

STEVEN
Damn cable is out Son of a bitch

ROBIN

out of his wallet He dials
it then presses the number in

STEVEN

Steven dials the Cable Guys beeper number into the phone The moment
he is finished dialing -

disturbed different than weve ever seen him before Steven is

life Steven turns back to the

cable Guy annoyed

CABLE GUY

STEVEN
(not laughing)

CABLE GUY
So what did you want to rap about

The trumpets go off the lights go down and the show begins

CABLE GUY

The Cable Guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above
the arena

32 ON THE STAGE - A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE ALAN RICKMAN IN ROBIN

corresponds with a knight

swords while on
horseback

ON STEVEN AND THE CABLE GUY - They are eating whole chickens with
their bare hands
while watching the show

The waitress exits

CABLE GUY

The two knights fight with swords After a few moments of battle the
Red Knight wins

The crowd erupts The Cable Guy goes crazy

CABLE GUY

Releuctantly Steven stands up and applauds

STEVEN

(halfheartedly)

Way to go Red Knight Good job of
killing Good work

Steven and the Cable Guy sit down

CABLE GUY
So what were you saying before
STEVEN

(tentatively)

How do I put this Ive really enjoyed
hanging out with you but

CABLE GUY

Thats why I became a cable guy To make
friends like you Every time I walk up to
a new door that door is a possibility
for friendship When I walked in your
apartment I knew there was something
there I just knew it

STEVEN

(sotto)

Oh lord

(tries to get back on track)

I want you to know --

The lights change Trumpets play a fanfare The host walks out onto
the stage interrupting
Steven

HOST

We have reached the climax of our
competition good people Now two noble
men from our audience will battle to the
death to resolve a grievance Willa
Master

(looks at his clipboard)

Steven M Bartowsky and Lord Ernie
Douglas make you way to the fighting
pit

A spotlight shines on them Steven is shocked

STEVEN
Whats going on

CABLE GUY
Were going to do battle Itll be fun

STEVEN
Is this a normal part of the show

CABLE GUY

No but I give all the Knights free
cable They said it would be cool if we
just went at it for a little while

Two PIMPLY FACED SERFS from the show come and lead them away
STEVEN
Is this safe

CABLE GUY
Thats what the armors for

34 INT FIGHTING PIT - LATER

Steven and the Cable Guy are being dressed in armor by the two serfs
The Cable Guy could not
be happier Steven is freaked out

STEVEN
What are we supposed to do Weve got to
be careful we dont hurt each other

The Cable Guy doesnt answer him He has his game face on

CABLE GUY

I cannot listen to any of your
instructions for you are my sworn enemy
and are about to meet your demise

Before Steven can answer him the trumpets blare

HOST
Let the battle begin Come now people
let me hear your voices

The crowd cheers Music plays The serfs hand them each a sword and
shield then walk them to
the center of the pit

The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position He begins to circle
Steven like a cat Steven
mirrors him not sure of what to do

STEVEN
Just take it easy

The Cable Guy runs at Steven and swings his sword In fear Steven
puts his shield over his head

The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air The Cable Guy
darts toward Steven and

pokes him several times with his sword Each time Steven blocks it
with either his sword or his

shield

STEVEN

(enraged)

What are you doing
CABLE GUY
(matter of fact)
Im trying to kill you

The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to
it) off of a weapon filled

wall and runs at Steven swinging with abandon Steven blocks the
deadly mace with his shield

STEVEN
Hey watch it

The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven Then he speaks into his ear as he
pushes him down onto the
ground

CABLE GUY

This is just like when Spock had to fight
Kirk on Star Trek Best friends forced
to do battle

Steven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him He swings at
the Cable Guy with his

sword just missing him The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops
back up in the air

CABLE GUY
Thats the spirit Lets give em a good
show

Steven charges at the Cable Guy swinging wildly It is a real battle
now He bangs away at the

Cable Guys mace until he knocks it out of his hands The Cable Guy
runs backwards then falls on

the ground

By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guys feelings are
hurt

CABLE GUY

So thats how its gonna be huh All
right If you want to play rought Daddy
can play rough

The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield He upper cuts the
shield to Stevens face
sending him to the ground

The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax a four foot
long stick with a fancy
silver blade on the end of it He swings it in circles like a Japanese
master Steven grabs a similar
weapon and then begin to circle each other

STEVEN
Chip this isnt funny Will you stop
it

CABLE GUY

The name is Spock If we dont battle to
the death theyll kill us both Good-bye
Jim

He swings his sword and they battle Star Trek style The Cable Guy
begins to sing the Star Trek
Battle Music as they fight

STEVEN
This isnt Star Trek

MUSIC UP STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC

They bang the handles of their battle axes together jockeying for
position The Cable Guy pushes

Steven away from him then takes a huge swing but Steven leaps in the
air over the blade The

Cable Guy swings over his head and Steven blocks it with his ax
handle They continue to swing

and roll in a vicious battle

Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block The
battle ax cuts through part

of Stevens protection

STEVEN

(looking down)

Jesus

The Cable Guy runs to a horses entrance There is a long pause and
then we hear the sound of

pounding horse hooves A moment later the Cable Guy rides out ona
horse holding a jousting

stick

The shows host runs up to Steven

HOST

Quickly muster a top your steed

(Steven doesnt move - the host drops character)
Get on the god damn horse I dont think

hes kidding
Left with no choice Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust The
host smacks Stevens horse

sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy

STEVEN

Dont do this

CABLE GUY

Jim we have no choice

STEVEN

Oh my god

They run toward each other A horrible game of chicken Neither gives
in When they reach one

another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting
stick

The Cable Guy flies through the air lands on his back Steven rides
to him Jumps off his horse

throws off his helmet

STEVEN

(concerned)

Are you okay

The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him
CABLE GUY

Well done good sir You are the victor
but we shall meet again

The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles They carry
him to the center of the

arena in victory The crowd cheers wildly Steven feels the adrenaline
rush He holds up his arms

in triumph and smiles

The man puts out his hand to take the paper towel but the Cable Guy
doesnt hand it to him he

grabs the mans hands and surrounds them with several paper towels
and begins drying them

furiously When hes done he takes a beat and wipes them over and
over just to make sure theyre

dry The man is aghast
CABLE GUY
Enjoy your meal

The man exits Ray walks toward the stalls

CABLE GUY
Good evening sir Pleasant night isnt

Ray unzips his fly and prepares to pee standing up Suddenly as if
out of thin air the Cable Guy
is standing right behind him He speaks into Rays ear startling him

CABLE GUY
Im here to serve you

RAY
Jesus Get out of here

CABLE GUY

Most people never bother to take
advantage of all my services for
instance -

The Cable Guy grabs the back of Rays shirt kicks his feet out from
under him and slams his face

into the toilet bowl sloshing it around Ray struggles but the Cable
Guy is too strong

CABLE GUY
I can help you wash up Cleanliness is
so very important
He pulls his face out

CABLE GUY

Then once youre done I have a variety of
skin care products which can make you
look years younger

The Cable Guy kicks the door open and pulls Ray toward the counter
He grabs a bottle of lotion

CABLE GUY
This lotion is superb at removing liver
spots

He slaps it onto Rays face

CABLE GUY
This one is an excellent moisturizer

The Cable Guy pours some after cologne into his hands and rubs his
hands together as if hes
about to put it on Rays face

CABLE GUY
And one can never underestimate the
effects of a good cologne

The Cable Guy rears back and slaps Ray across the face

CABLE GUY

(sniffs)

Mm High Karate And now a touch of
powder

He takes a large powder puff and smashes it into Rays face
temporarily blinding him

CABLE GUY

(grabs a tweezer)

Ooh I almost forget its oh so very
important to be properly tweezed

The Cable Guy plucks several hairs out from between Rays eyebrows

CABLE GUY
Youre on a big date youll need fresh
breath

He takes a clear jar of combs and pours the blue fluid and the combs
into Rays mouth

CABLE GUY
Whoops thats not mouth wash But that
reminds me Proper hair care is a must

The Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking
side part

CABLE GUY
Looking good now lets dry you off

He runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand
dryer It turns on The Cable
Guy puts his face right up next to the air

CABLE GUY
Now suck it Suck the air

Ray hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle and his cheeks start
fluttering like an astronaut
experiencing heavy G-Force

CABLE GUY

Armstrong experiencing G-Force I
believe you have the right stuff

The Cable Guy pulls him away and smashes his face into the tip
basket

Steven tackles him to the ground and begins hitting him They are
both covered in mud like

warriors from the rain forest Steven grabs a large rock and holds it
over his head

STEVEN
Tell me

CABLE GUY
(nonchalantly)
Im sorry I didnt catch the question

Steven brings down the rock At the last moment the Cable Guy moves
his head The rock slams
into the ground

CABLE GUY
Steven youve changed
(beat - then impressed)
I like it

The Cable Guy convulses his body pushing Steven off him

They wrestle on the ground The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven then
pulls a power drill out of
his belt and turns it on

CABLE GUY
I think its time to make you cable ready

He slowly brings the drill down to Steven Steven blindly reaches
behind him He grasps a large
branch and bats the Cable Guy off him

The Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven They
begin fighting in a fashion
which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight

CABLE GUY
Last time we fought I let you win Best
two out of three

MUSIC UP Ominous version of the Star Trek battle music

CABLE GUY
(crazed)
You treat me like the TV You use me but
you cant live without me

The Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch

CABLE GUY
You cant shut me off with your remote
control Im not like Robin and Rick

and Mommy and Daddy and brother and
sister and cousin --

Steven smashes him in the head with the branch

STEVEN
I got the point

The Cable Guy goes down He appears to be unconscious

ROBIN
(in the distance)
Steven

He looks to the dish but cannot see her
123 EXT SATELLITE DISH - MOMENTS LATER

Steven climbs over the edge into the dish Below him he sees that the
bottom of the dish is filled
with several feet of rain water

Three wires go from the points on the edge of the dish and meet at a
point at the center of the

satellite thirty feet above the floor of the dish ROBIN is hanging
by her bound hands from the

center of where those wires meet

Steven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish

ROBIN
Help me Steven

In the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing
through an entry hatch at
the top of the dish Robins eyes fill with terror

ROBIN
Steven Look out

CABLE GUY
(mimics her)
Yeah Steven Look out
The Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box He slides
down the dish knocking

Steven down The two tumble down the slope of the dish and tumble all
the way down into the

water

CABLE GUY
(sweetly like a girl)
Ive missed you

The Cable Guy immediately punches Steven sending him back into the
water The Cable Guy

dives on top of him A moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up
then grabs his collar and

speaks right into his face

CABLE GUY

(dramatically)

Dry land is not a myth Ive seen it
Kevin Costner from Waterworld I dont
know what the fuss was about the movie
ruled I saw it six times

He pulls Steven under the water and tries to hold him there He pulls
him up after a few moments

CABLE GUY
Isnt it weird that wevve wound up in
this position

He pushes him under the water again After a moment he pulls him back
up Steven gasps for air

CABLE GUY
Who would have thunk it

Enraged Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force
that it appears to have
knocked his jaw out of alignment

CABLE GUY

(without any lisp)

Youre gonna have to do better than that
Steven

(realizing his lisp is gone)

Steven Hey my lisp is gone

Steven hits him again this time on the other side of the face
CABLE GUY

(lisping again)
You stupid son of a bitch
The Cable Guy falls unconscious

ROBIN
Steven

Steven runs to her
124 EXT SATELLITE DISH - LATER

He runs to the side of the dish He realizes he must climb up to
release her He climbs onto the

WIRE and begins tightrope walking toward her He walks very slowly
almost losing his balance

several times

STEVEN
Hang on

CLOSE ON The opposite wire The Cable Guys muddy hands slam onto it
He pulls himself up

CABLE GUY

(laughs maniacally)

I know what your saying Who does this
guy think he is Jason

STEVEN
Stay away from her

Suddenly the Cable Guy does a front flip and lands perfectly on the
wire

CABLE GUY

I saw that in Trapeze starring Tony
Curtis He was just on Life-styles of
the Rich and Famous He still looks
terrific

Steven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin but the
reverberation from the Cable Guys

landing makes Steven lose his balance He falls over but catches ont
the wire He is left hanging

there

The Cable Guy sees this and begins to run incredibly fast toward
Robin

CABLE GUY
And the race is on
He does a cartwheel on the strut hops on one leg then takes off
toward her running at full speed

Steven left with no other option simply bounces up and down on the
wire Robin sees this and
joins him

The Cable Guy begins to lose his balance

CABLE GUY

(knows hes about to fall)

This is such an anti-climactic way to end
this

fq

The Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below The
Cable Guy has surely met his
demise

125 EXT SATELLITTE DISH - LATER

Steven and Robin are sitting in the dish a few feet from where the
water begins They are
exhausted from their ordeal They hold each other close

ROBIN
Im sorry I didnt believe you I love
you

STEVEN

I love you too Youre right We
shouldnt get married Ive got a lot of
problems to work out which have
absolutely nothing to do with you

ROBIN
Well work them out together

They kiss Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater He looks
frightening Then he starts

coughing uncontrollably He looks like a small boy who has swallowed
too much water

CABLE GUY

(between coughs)

What just happened Where am I
(remembers)

Oh yeah I was trying to kill you

He leaps at Steven and puts him in a head-lock He squeezes until
Steven passes out The he lays
him on the ground
CABLE GUY

(to Robin)

Its a sleeper hold Hulk Hogan used it
on Sly Stallone in Rocky Three He
should wake up in thirty seconds so
lets get going

He holds her around the neck and puts a staple gun to her head then
walks her out of the dish

Steven slowly wakes up He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin
beginning to climb up the
rdio antenna He quickly gets up to follow them

126 EXT ANTENNA - NIGHT

The Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna Steven follows them up from
a distance

The Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna
The Cable Guy holds Robin

with one hand and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other
hand Steven climbs onto the

platform

STEVEN
Easy

He walks with Robin to the edge of the platform There is a one-
hundred foot drop to the dish
below A police helicopter hovers in the air around them

CABLE GUY

It didnt have to be this way Steven Im
just trying to show you the kind of
things that can happen when you mistreat
people

STEVEN
Dont do anything stupid

CABLE GUY
You know this is just like that secen in
that Clint Eastwood movie Dirty Harry --

STEVEN

(snaps)

No This is not like anything This is
not a movie Were real people Youre
hurting us This is reality
The Cable Guys eyes turn sad This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker
punch Dazed he lets go of
Robin She runs to Stevens arms

From below we hear the sound of sirens A pack of police cars pull up
and surround the antenna

The Cable Guys expression changes He begins to look like a scared
little boy

CABLE GUY

If this is reality

(he climbs onto the guard railing)
I am outta here

The Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna

STEVEN
Nooo

Steven lunges for the Cable Guy grabbing his forearm then grabbing
the antenna with the other
hand

STEVEN
Youre not going anywhere

The Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish Steven tries to
pull the Cable Guy back onto
the platform but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved

STEVEN
Dont do this You just need help We all
get lonely

CABLE GUY

Yeah but I get really lonely
(beat)

I mean look at me

STEVEN
Youre gonna be fine Just come on up

CABLE GUY

(a long beat)

Steven I think I sat too close to the
television Mommy was right

Steven cant hold onto his forearm any longer The Cable Guys arm
slips and Steven grabs onto

his hand at the last possible second

CABLE GUY
Its too late for me but theres a lot
of little Cable Boys out there who still
have a chance Say good-bye to the baby-
sitter
