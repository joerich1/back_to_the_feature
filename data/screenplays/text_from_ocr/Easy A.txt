OLIVE (VO)
The rumors of my promiscuity have
been greatly exaggerated

FADE IN

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

OLIVE PENDERGHAST a cute teenager speaks directly
into
the WEBCAM atop her computer

OLIVE
Let the record show that I Olive
Penderghast being of sound mind
ample breast size and the
occasional corny knock knock joke
do enter this video blog into
evidence in the case against me
Because Im being judged by a jury
of my peers I will attempt to
insert “‘like and ‘totally into my
confession as much as possible So
here it goes I confess Im in
no small part to blame for the
vociferous gossip that has turned
my Varsity letter scarlet but -
for anyone hoping that the sizzling
details of my sordid past will
provide you with a reason to lock
the door and make love to a dollop
of your sisters moisturizing
lotion - youll be gravely
disappointed

(Beat)

Look I just need to set the record
straight and what better way to do
that than to broadcast it on the
nternet So here it is -- Part
One The Shudder-Inducing and
Cliched However Totally False
Account Of How I Lost My Virginity
To A Guy At A Community College In
A Neighboring Town

(Beat)

Let me just begin by saying that
there are two sides to every story
This is my side the right one
(Beat)

Like totally

INT CAFETERIA - DAY

Olive sits with her best friend RHIANNON ABERNATHY a
brash teenager It would be safe to say that these girls are
definitely on the B List at their school

RHIANNON
Fuck off George is not a ‘sexy
name George is like what you name
your teddy bear not the name you
wanna scream out during an orgasm

OLIVE
Thats bullshit There are lots of
sexy Georges

RHIANNON
Name three

Olive starts to say something but Rhiannon interrupts her

RHIANNON (CONTD)
Besides Clooney Too easy

OLIVE
Shouldnt that alone be enough

RHIANNON
Fine Thats one Number two

OLIVE
(THINKING)

RHIANNON

OLIVE
Bullshit Ben Affleck played him

RHIANNON (CONTD)

a sexy name in some era

OLIVE
George Stephanopolous

RHIANNON

OLIVE
(THINKING HARD)
George

RHIANNON
Bush Yeah Hes one hot

George

OLIVE
Well mine is So I think we
should just put this conversation
to bed

RHIANNON
Fine Dont come I hate you

Rhiannon folds her arms and pouts

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY
Olive continues to narrate into her webcam

OLIVE
Let me back up I dont know if
any of you have ever met them but
Rhiannons parents are quite
possibly the creepiest people ina
four county radius

INT THE ABERNATHY LIVING ROOM

MR and MRS ABERNATHY (50s) sit on their couch smiling at
the television in their horrifically rustic home

MR ABERNATHY bares a striking resemblance to ukelele
player

Tiny Tim (Although the man were looking at has an even

more frightening smile)

MRS ABERNATHY has hair to her ankles and dresses like a
Mormon

OLIVE (VO)

Ive always felt sort of sorry for
Rhiannon but not enough to do what
she was asking me to do

We float upwards to -

INT RHIANNONS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Rhiannon is on the phone agitated
RHIANNON
(Into the phone)

PLEASE Please Im begging you
Ill pay you

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Olive is on the other end of the phone conversation

We INTERCUT between the two sides

OLIVE
Rhi I cant I told you I have
plans

RHIANNON

Youre lying Youre a lying bitch
and I hate you so much right now

OLIVE

(LYING)
Im not lying I promise Im not
I really would love to go camping
with your family this weekend I
had fun with your family last year

EXT WOODS - LAST YEAR - NIGHT

Olive uncomfortable and Rhiannon bored sit around a
campfire with the Abernathys

The couple stare at the fire with the same creepy smile
plastered on their faces

There is an excruciatingly long and painful silence

MR ABERNATHY

Would you like a marshmallow Olive
Oil

Mrs Abernathy squeaks out a meek titter that is annoyingly
high-pitched

MRS ABERNATHY
Olive oil Thats funny Very
very funny

OLIVE
(POLITELY)
No thank you Mr Abernathy

MR ABERNATHY

You can call me Mortimer Olive
Branch

Mrs Abernathy titters again Rhiannon rolls her eyes
There is another awkwardly long silence while the
Abernathys
grin away at their fire

INT RHIANNONS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Rhiannon is getting increasingly angrier at her friend

RHIANNON
(Into the phone)
Why dont you just say it You
dont like my parents You think
theyre hopelessly pathetic and
devoid of souls and wish that you
could live with normal people who
didnt meet at a Star Trek
convention

She quickly catches her faux pas and stops talking

OLIVE
(Sympathetic to her

FRIEND)
Rhi I like your parents Theyre
sweet But I cant go camping this
weekend

RHIANNON
Quick Hurry and make up a lie

OLIVE
I have a date

RHIANNON
Liar

OLIVE

(LYING)
No I do

RHIANNON
With who

OLIVE

You dont know him

RHIANNON
And neither do you you selfish
bitch

OLIVE
Im serious He goes to the
community college with my brother
in Denton

RHIANNON
Whats his name then

OLIVE
(WAXING CUTE)
Who My brother

RHIANNON
Stop stalling Youre totally
trying to come up with a name
Just say it

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY
Into the webcam --

OLIVE
Im not proud of this Less about
the lie and more about the
unoriginality of it Okay have
you guys ever watched “The Brady
Bunch Of course you havent
Youre busy watching fake people
pretend to be real on MIV Thats
why I knew I could get away with
it See there was this episode
where Jan - the awkward middle
child - made up a boyfriend to
assuage the ridicule of her snatchy
sister who had just stolen the
heart of the boy that Jan loved
The name of her imaginary boyfriend

WAS --

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - DAY

OLIVE
(Into the phone)
George Glass

RHIANNON
George What kind of a fucking
at

name is George

OLIVE
Hes pretty hot and he asked me out
this weekend so I said yes

Although still skeptical she seems a tad more mollified

RHIANNON
If youre choosing him over helping
me cope with two days in the
wilderness with these people who
even Im not convinced arent
serial killers he had better be
the one You had better fucking
marry him have fucking babies with
him and then take him for fucking
everything hes worth

OLIVE
Deal

INT CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

Rhi and Olive continue their conversation as Rhi pops a
tater tot into her mouth

RHIANNON
(With her mouth full)
Youre not off the hook you know
I want lurid details This had
better be the best date of your
life to counterbalance the worst
weekend of mine

OLIVE
Im sure youll have a good time

EXT WOODS - NIGHT
Rhi sits bored and uncomfortable while her parents smile

the campfire for an again awkwardly long moment

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

To her webcam --
OLIVE
(Through the proverbial

CLENCHED TEETH)
Even though we now hate each other
Rhi I really hope youre watching
this Because this parts for you
The lurid details of my weekend en
flagrante delicto with the all-too-
imaginary yet surprisingly
satisfying George Glass

Ken Nordines beat poem “OLIVE (from the late 60s album
“Colors) underscored to jazz plays as we see a montage of

To the

webcam --

OLIVE

But on Monday when Rhi asked me
how my weekend was

INT HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Olive and Rhi walk with books in hand to class - weaving

and out of people

OLIVE
It was nothing short of perfection

RHIANNON
Details bitch Wait first I need
a scope of reference Who would
play him in the movie of your life

OLIVE
Ryan Gosling definitely

RHIANNON
That works Spill

OLIVE
He was charming A real gentleman

RHIANNON
Are you going to see him again

OLIVE
Probably not It was just one of
those weekends

RHIANNON
The whole weekend

OLIVE
Yeah

Rhiannon suddenly stops and twirls Olive to face her

RHIANNON
Wait a minute You didnt

OLIVE
No of course not

RHIANNON

(VERY LOUDLY)
You fucking liar You totally lost
your virginity to him

Pedestrian students stop in their tracks to stare at them

OLIVE
I did not

RHIANNON
YES YOU DID YOU LYING FUCKING
WHORE
Olive grabs her and drags her forward interrupting the
show

RHIANNON (CONTD)
Tell me everything and spare me the
coquettish “just-the-tip bullshit
(MORE)

RHIANNON (CONTD)
I know you did it I know you let
him put it inside you so just TELL
ME

OLIVE
Im not that kind of girl

RHIANNON
The kind that does it or the kind
that does it like a fucking porn
star and then doesnt have the
balls to talk about it

Rhi drags her into the --

INT GIRLS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
-- and abrasively gets up in Olives face

RHIANNON
I want every perverted detail
NOW bitch

Pressured Olive lies

OLIVE
Okay Fine We did it

RHIANNON
You lost your virginity Fucking
finally Now youre a super-slut
like me

OLIVE
Rhi Blowing Peter Tolliver once
behind the Pizza Hut doesnt make
you a super-slut

RHIANNON
There were people walking past
Whatever this isnt about me
This is about YOU What did you
let him do

OLIVE (VO)
I started piling on lie after lie
It was like setting up Jenga

cut To

A well-manicured FEMALE HAND stacks WOODEN JENGA BLOCKS onto
a table

BACK TO

OLIVE (CONTD)
It was Normal Nothing freaky
It was sweet HE was sweet

RHIANNON
Was he big Did it hurt

OLIVE
No It was great Like I said
Okay thats enough

The toilet flushes and MARIANNE BRYANT an Aryanesque
cardigan-wearing Christian-girl exits from a stall and walks
to the sink where she vigorously washes her hands - while
staring at Rhi and Olive with disgust

RHIANNON
What the fuck are you looking at
Marianne

MARIANNE
Nothing Just a couple of admitted
whores

Marianne wipes her hands and leaves the restroom Olives
stomach revolves at her now-turned-public admission

OLIVE
So how was your weekend

(I promise its the last time)

EXT WOODS - NIGHT
The Abernathys smile at the campfire roasting WEINERS
Rhiannon would rather be anywhere other than there

MR ABERNATHY
Wienie Rhi

Rhi snorts in contempt of her father and his wienie

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

OLIVE
Marianne Bryant as we all know is
the President of the Christian
Student Coalition and is that rare
breed of human born with a stick
the size of a baseball bat
implanted up her anus Gods
honest Im sure its in some
medical dictionary somewhere

INT HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - LAST YEAR

Marianne and her lackey NINA HOWELL whos just as
awful as she is pass out flyers

OLIVE (VO)

Last years cause celebre was the
changing of the school mascot
which she spearheaded

Marianne aggressively shoves her literature into passing
students faces

INT GYM - LAST YEAR

The schools MASCOT a SHIRTLESS MUSCULAR KID painted
BLUE and costumed as a DEVIL bursts into the auditorium and
begins to rile students up by thrusting his PITCHFORK in the
air

MASCOT
Blue Devils Blue Devils Blue

Devils

The crowd goes wild
INT HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - LAST YEAR -
CONTINUOUS

Marianne melodramatically grabs a PASSING STUDENT by the
arm

MARIANNE
How can we exhibit school pride
when were conveyed to others as
satan worshippers

The scared student takes her pamphlet and runs away

OLIVE (VO)
Now thankfully were the much
less intimidating --

INT GYM - LAST YEAR - MONTHS LATER

The mascot unenthusiastic and feeling ridiculous walks
into
the gym dressed as a --

OLIVE (VO)
Meerkat

MASCOT
Go meerkats Go meerkats

He cant seem to get himself or the student body as excited

with the exception of Marianne and Nina in the stands
applauding proudly

The school band is playing GOLDFINGER
Across the gym Olive sits with Rhiannon

RHIANNON
What the fuck is a meerkat anyway

OLIVE
Beats the hell out of me But can
we just take a moment to applaud
the Barbara Bush High School
Marching Band for their very
ambitious effort to learn all of
the James Bond theme music ina
single year I personally wish
them all the best in their
endeavor Ku-dos

RHIANNON
I think I speak for all of the
female students and faculty - and
maybe a couple of males - when I
say that I liked Todd much better
when he was shirtless I actually
looked forward to these disturbing
displays of -- what do they call
it

OLIVE
School spirit

RHIANNON
Yeah Thats it

OLIVE

Even dressed as a meerkat I still
fantasize about him

RHIANNON
Ha What are those people called
again The ones that dress up like
stuffed animals when they do it

OLIVE
Communists

Rhiannon laughs

RHIANNON
Shhh Dont let Marianne hear you
say that word The last thing we
need is McCarthyism at Barbara
Bush

OLIVE
Isnt high school already a hotbed
of just that

RHIANNON
True
(Beat)
Yeah Id totally fuck Meerkat
Todd
They both get lost in the thought

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY
Into the webcam --

OLIVE
So of course immediately I knew
that the little white lie I told to
my then-best-friend in the ladies
room would come back to bite me on
the ass However even I - who my
fourth grade teacher stated on my
report card “has an imagination
that should be quickly expunged -
had no idea how quickly this
article of fiction would spread
So now we move on to Part Two The
Accelerated Velocity of
Terminological Inexactitude

INT HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Olive loads books into her locker She sees Marianne walk
past with Nina They give her a repulsed look

Olive decides to nip this in the bud She catches up to
them

OLIVE
Hey Marianne can I talk to you for
a second

Nina reluctantly gives them a moment alone

MARIANNE
(EXASPERATED)
What

OLIVE
Listen what you heard in the
bathroom that wasnt true Its
actually a funny story Do you
ever watch “The Brady Bunch

MARIANNE
Olive - thats your name right
Olive knows that Marianne knows her name

nods

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Im not the one you have to answer
to for your depraved behavior
There is a higher power to judge
your indecency

OLIVE
(JOKINGLY)
Who The guidance counselor

MARIANNE

(ICILY)
I hope for your sake God has a
sense of humor

OLIVE
Oh I have sixteen years worth of
anecdotal proof that He does

but obligingly

Olive looks over and sees that Nina is talking to a group of

GUYS who are looking at Olive intrigued

OLIVE (CONTD)
(SOTTO VOCE)
Damn it

Marianne sees what her friend is doing and smiles at Olive

Cc

S
Pp

oldly

MARIANNE
Look Youve made your bed I
just hope for your sake you
cleaned the sheets

OLIVE
(TO HERSELF)
Did I just get saved

GUY IN HALL
Hey Olive Hows it going

Without stopping --

he turns on her heels and leaves Olive behind

he shakes off her attempt and continues on her way walking
ast the guys who smile at her This alarms her
OLIVE
Im swell guy-Ive-never-laid-eyes-
on-before Thanks for asking

OLIVE (VO) (CONTD)

All I could think to myself was
“Great now Im going to have to
start wearing red lipstick and
stiletto heels

Battling her frustration she goes to class

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Olive eats dinner with her family

Her father DILL (40s) is a regular dad-kinda-guy Her
mother ROSEMARY (40s) is heavyset with a fun disposition
Also in attendance is her ‘a-little-too-precious sister
GINGER Olive and her folks get along really well

OLIVE
Hey you guys know that I was here
all weekend right

They all nod at her

OLIVE (CONTD)
And you would testify to that

DILL
(SLIGHTLY CONCERNED )
Whats up sweet pea

OLIVE
Its nothing Just the rumor mill

ROSEMARY
Whats the rumor mill turning out
these days

OLIVE
Seriously its nothing

They continue to eat
ROSEMARY
Dont forget your brothers staying
here next weekend

OLIVE
Why He never comes home

ROSEMARY
Theyre fumigating the dorms And
thank God for that Last time I
was there I saw three cockroaches

GINGER

(WHINY)
Mom can you please not say that
word while Im eating

ROSEMARY
Sorry hon

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY
Into the webcam --

OLIVE
Like all families mine has a deep
dark secret And since Im
spilling all this dirt I might as
well go ahead and confess it

She takes a deep breath

OLIVE (CONTD)
Im trusting that this nugget of
information isnt going to be
spread around but - okay here it
goes My dads name is Dill and my
mothers name is Rosemary They
were so amused by this that they
decided to name all of their
children after --

(FEIGNING DISCOMFORT)
-- edible items
(With mock emotion)
My brothers name is Sage and my
sisters name is Ginger Its
shocking I know Were like a
fucking pantry us Penderghasts

(SNAPPING BACK)
But at least my parents didnt meet
at a “Star Trek convention BITCH
Sorry Now Im just being mean
Okay Back to the story

INT HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

As Olive walks through school she is met with a totally
different energy She no longer blends in Guys are
checking her out Girls are glaring at her scornfully

Shes kind of digging it

OLIVE (VO)

So while I would never have
classified myself as a wallflower
I was now the center of attention
and who doesnt love that Jeez

if Id known that losing my
virginity would create such a new
persona for myself Id have lied
about it back in eighth grade
Eighth grade sucked I did get my
first kiss back then however It
was gross and kind of turned me off
to the whole my-tongue-in-other-
peoples-mouths thing Not to
mention the even-worse other-
peoples-tongues-in-MY-mouth thing
Seriously folks Who invented
kissing Why is everyone so dead-
set on sticking their body parts in
other peoples orifices If

theres a hole on a person rest
assured somebody wants to stick
something of theirs in it

INT CLOSET

In almost complete darkness a very nervous EIGHTH GRADE
OLIVE sits with a scared shitless EIGHTH GRADE KID

You can hear other PRE-TEENS snickering and whispering
outside the door

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
So I think this is the part where
youre supposed to stick your
tongue in my mouth Its just what
Ive heard

EIGHTH GRADE KID
Just give me a second okay

Olive presses a button and her watch illuminates

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
According to my watch you have 382
of them

EIGHTH GRADE KID
How do you do that

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
What

EIGHTH GRADE KID
Add so fast And you also talk
like a grown up

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
Dont worry Im not nearly as
smart as I think I am

The kid snickers He feels a little more at ease

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE (CONTD)

I think its just practice For
when I do grow up Plus dont
sweat it Girls mature faster than
boys

EIGHTH GRADE KID
Thats what they say

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
And its probably the reason Im
ready to do this and youre not

EIGHTH GRADE KID
Is it that obvious

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
Painfully so

EIGHTH GRADE KID
So if we didnt do anything would
you tell everybody
EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE

Absolutely I will tell everyone
you pussied out and the whole
school will make fun of you and
youll most likely spend the rest
of your teen years as a joke - no
even worse - a cautionary tale

They both laugh

EIGHTH GRADE KID

The Kid Who Opted Not To Kiss The
Girl

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
Theyll tell it for years Itll
be a suburban legend

The kid smiles warmly and gratefully at her

EIGHTH GRADE KID
Thanks Olive

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
Dont mention it

EIGHTH GRADE KID
No YOU dont mention it

She extends her pinky to him They link pinkies and they
swear on it

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
We still have five minutes and
thirty six seconds

Theres a long silence

EIGHTH GRADE KID
Im really interested in politics

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
Oh yeah

EIGHTH GRADE KID
Totally

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
Well Uh Cool
him

Theres another long silence Finally from outside the door

PRETEEN KID (0S)
Ewwwww Hunter Neblett just puked
all over the dining room

Olive and the kid listen as people scurry from outside the
closet

EIGHTH GRADE KID
Thank God

EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE

Hey were in Junior High Vomit-
viewing will always trump spit-
swapping

The kid starts to make his grand escape but Olive stops
EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE (CONTD)

Real fast - and you can tell me the
truth Its not because Im --

The kid smiles

EIGHTH GRADE KID
No Youre very pretty

He extends his pinky and she links it to hers He kisses her
quickly on the cheek and darts from the closet

Olive sits in the closet for a moment contemplating what
just happened wondering if he was telling the truth then
she opens the door

The coast is clear except for ANOTHER PRETEEN KID walking
past She aggressively grabs him and pulls him into the
closet with her and promptly thrusts her tongue into his
mouth

They make out

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Olive seems lost in thought She snaps back to reality and
the task at hand

OLIVE
If Id known that Meerkat Todd was
going to turn out so hot I
probably would have cherished the
moment more I suppose just that
Im sitting here reminiscing about
it means that it must have meant
something
(Beat)
Yeah so anyway - kissings not
really my thing Thats what I
learned in Natalie Giblins closet
I digress

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

Olive half-listens in class while her English teacher MR
GRIFFIN (early 30s) a handsome guy lectures on “THE
SCARLET LETTER

OLIVE (VO)

So Im feeling like the cats ass
because everyone thinks Ive been
deflowered Im surprised at how
empowered I felt by this
prevarication I wonder to myself
would I feel this invigorated if I
had actually let some college kid
violate me in his cockroach-
infested dorm room Probably not
(Beat)

Ironically we were studying “The
Scarlet Letter’ but isnt that
always the way with these teenage
tales The literature you read in
class always seems to have a strong
connection with whatever angsty
adolescent drama is being
recounted I consider this
(Pause )

Then I think Except for
“Huckleberry Finn I dont know
any teenage boys who have ever run
away with a big hulking black guy

MR GRIFFIN
Alright so thoughts

Nina raises her hand Mr Griffin points to her
she

NINA

I think Hester Prynne was - excuse
my language - a whore

MR GRIFFIN
You dont see her as a victim

NINA
Why should I She brought it on
herself

Nina whips around and gives Olive a look surprising her

OLIVE
Excuse me

NINA
Perhaps you should embroider a red
A on your wardrobe

OLIVE
Perhaps you should GET a wardrobe
you twat

The class bursts into surprised laughter Even Mr Griffin
tries hard to suppress a congratulatory glance in her
direction

OLIVE (VO) (CONTD)

Admittedly not my best line But

it was provocative enough to land

me in the Principals office
Mr Griffin begrudgingly calls her to his desk He starts
writing something on a piece of paper

INT FRONT OFFICE - BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Olive sits with her arms crossed outside of the Principals
office She clenches a note in her fist

Marianne whos an office aid has a smirk on her face as

watches Olive squirm She slams her fist down on the
stapler repetitively

FINALLY --

MARIANNE
Seems as if someones on a downward
spiral

OLIVE
Seems as if someones practicing
the mundane activities shell be
saddled with the rest of her
pathetic life

MARIANNE
You have a chip on your shoulder
the size of Texas

OLIVE
Wow thats even bigger than your
ass

MARIANNE

(COLDLY)

Youre going to hell

OLIVE
(Growing weary of this
BANTER)
As long as you wont be there

MARIANNE
Oh I can assure you I wont

Neither says anything for a few moments

MARIANNE (CONTD)
I hope you at least had the good
sense to wear a condom

OLIVE
Why Your parents didnt

MARIANNE
You know youre just like --

The principals door opens and Marianne quickly shuts up and
continues her work

TWO KIDS emerge One obviously a bully the other

obviously the bullied The BULLIED kid is holding a

BLOODIED TISSUE up to his nose He and Olive exchange
meaningful glances

PRINCIPAL GIBBONS (60s) a colossal prick disguised as a
man gestures for her to come in Olive gets up and enters -

INT PRINCIPAL GIBBONSS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He closes the door behind them He holds his hand out and
she gives him the note that Mr Griffin wrote Gibbons
studies it

PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
I dont know you

She thrusts her hand out

OLIVE
Olive Penderghast

He eyes her hand not amused and she quickly withdraws it

PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
Why are we just now meeting Using
language like this should have
warranted a visit to me years ago

OLIVE
Well to be perfectly honest - Ive
never used an epithet like this in
an educational arena before Sir

PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
This is foul

OLIVE
In my defense I think I meant to
say “twit It just came out more -
whats the word Im looking for
Veracious

PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
A young lady with such an extensive
vocabulary shouldnt be stooping to
such vituperations

OLIVE
(SMILING)

Touché

As serious as a heart attack
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
Wipe that smile off your face --
(Consulting the note)
Olive I dont tolerate this kind
of language Ever Consider this
your first warning If I find out
youve used a word like this in my
school again I will make sure that
its your last I dont operate on
a “three strikes youre out
system You get one warning from
me

She starts to say something --

PRINCIPAL GIBBONS (CONTD)
Think very carefully before you
speak

She relents but stares him squarely in the eyes

OLIVE
I always do Are we finished

He gestures to the door

PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
Detention tomorrow after school in
Room 704 And young lady I dont
want to see you again

OLIVE
Not even in a more positive
capacity Maybe I could wina
ribbon or a medal or something I
could conceivably be valedictorian
Or something

PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
(FRIGHTENINGLY SERIOUS)

Get out of my office now

She quickly runs out of his office

EXT BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Rhiannon excitedly approaches Olive - dying to talk to
her
RHIANNON

OLIVE

RHIANNON

socked her in the nose

OLIVE

(Beat)
Look theres something I need to

Rhiannon ignores her sincere attempt to confess

RHIANNON
Yeah Like the exact moment you

(MORE)

RHIANNON (CONTD)
Please tell me you at least left a
mark on that scrunched-up face of
hers POW The cunt goes down for

Rhiannon pulls her keys from her purse and they walk to her

OLIVE (CONTD)

Her parents seem more impressed than upset This is
definitely a first

DILL
What did you do

OLIVE
I used inappropriate language in
English class But were reading a
book that I personally deem
wildly inappropriate for my age
group so I felt that it was
actually quite apropos

ROSEMARY
(More curious than angry)
What did you say

Olive looks to her little sister and thinks better of saying
the word out loud

OLIVE
Lets just say it was an

inappropriate word

DILL
What did it start with

OLIVE
A snide comment from a snotty-ass
girl in my class

DILL
I meant what letter did it start
with

OLIVE
Oh Yeah T

ROSEMARY

T Thats an odd one Is this one
of those new curse words

Both her parents wheels are going Theyre both seeking the
answer in their heads but are coming up with nothing
ROSEMARY (CONTD)
Was it --

She leans over and whispers something in her daughters ear

OLIVE
I dont even know what that means

ROSEMARY
Yeah Neither do I

Her parents search their brains but nothing is coming to
them

DILL
Okay Noun adjective or verb

OLIVE
Noun Definitely slang Think
British although they pronounce it

differently

ROSEMARY
Well Im stumped Whisper it in
my ear

OLIVE

I cant Too weird

Excited by the prospect --

ROSEMARY
Oo Oo Spell it with your peas

OLIVE

Now THATS a challenge
She begins maneuvering her peas around the plate

DILL
Does this have something to do with
this rumor you were talking about
the other night

Olive touches her index finger to her nose as she continues
to manipulate her food

DILL (CONTD)
Is there something you want to tell
us kiddo

OLIVE
Im spelling it out for you as
quickly as I can

GINGER
(Desperate for attention)
I got a B plus on my spelling test
today

Too intrigued by Olives admission to really care --

ROSEMARY
Good sweetheart

Rosemary figures it out as Olive is assembling the A

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
Oh I know what it is

She leans over and whispers it in Dills ear He nods in
understanding

GINGER
(Glancing at Olives

PLATE)
Whats a twat

Olive quickly scrapes the peas into a pile

DILL
Its a word that will get you sent
to the principals office

ROSEMARY
(Whispering into Gingers
EAR)
Its not a good word
(MORE)

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
(TO OLIVE)
So what was the principal like

OLIVE
The male equivalent

ROSEMARY
Of what
Now its Dills turn to whisper in Rosemarys ear

in understanding

DILL
Well its the first time since
second grade so I guess we cant
be too hard on you

OLIVE

(GENUINELY CURIOUS)
What would my punishment have been
otherwise

DILL
I dunno To bed without supper

OLIVE
But Im already finished Except
for my helpful and profane peas

DILL

(THINKING HARD)
Uhhhh This grounding thing seems
to be taking the country by storm
No phone TV or Or

OLIVE

Illegitimate Children of the Real
Housewives of Laguna Beach and I

cheek

OLIVE

DILL

(Whispering in her ear)
And Im sure that girl was acting

OLIVE

She goes over and kisses her mom on the cheek as well
Leaving the dining room --

OLIVE (CONTD)
Hows about I go and punish myself

Mea culpa mea culpa

She retreats upstairs

GINGER
How come you guys never get mad at
her

ROSEMARY

Because pumpkin of our three
darling children we love her best
(Erupting into laughter)

Just kidding Now eat your dinner

Dill chuckles but Ginger is not amused

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

OLIVE
The next day things took a turn
for the scandalous Which brings
us to Part Three A Ladys Choice
and a Gentlemans Agreement

She smiles slyly into her camera

INT ROOM 704 - DAY

Bored Olive sits at a desk in a classroom reading a
tattered copy of “The Scarlet Letter Shes dressed much
racier and is starting to look pretty hot

Theres only one other person in the room The BULLIED KID
seen by Olive leaving Gibbonss office the day before

The bullied kid is thin as a rail pale as a ghost and
slightly effeminate He looks miserable Not just by this
detention but from life in general

OLIVE
Are these detention sessions often
unchaperoned

BULLIED KID
I dont think we pose a flight
risk

OLIVE
I see

Olive laughs to herself

BULLIED KID
What

OLIVE
I was just thinking its kind of
funny We havent really talked
since that closet incident back in
eighth grade

BULLIED KID
I was afraid you were going to
bring that up

OLIVE
So how have you been Brandon

BRANDON

(DRYLY)
I have been fantastic

(MORE)

BRANDON (CONTD)
Really really amazing Dont know
if you heard but according to my
locker Im a “power bottom

OLIVE
Yikes

BRANDON
Yeah only two days after the
custodians had finally gotten
around to scrubbing ‘turd burglar
off Which if you think about it
really contradicts the previous
label

OLIVE
Maybe your vandal is marvelling at
your versatility

Brandon shoots her a “thats not funny

BRANDON
But of course Im in detention

OLIVE
Why

BRANDON
Because Gibbons is a homophobe
(Beat)
And I called him a facist

OLIVE
So the rumors are true huh

BRANDON
(INCREDULOUS)
Have you ever met me

OLIVE
No I meant about Gibbons being a
facist

He laughs

OLIVE (CONTD)
I kind of guessed it that night
with the whole kissing thing The
way you ran away I remember
thinking to myself “this isnt the

look
first time this kids going to go
bursting out of the closet

BRANDON
Gold star for you Nancy Drew

Theres a brief silence between them

OLIVE
You know I read this article that
said with this whole EMO movement
it looks like - that in a few years
- the gay kids are going to be the
most popular ones in school

BRANDON
Oh good Ill come back when Im
twenty seven for my redo

Ignoring his cynicism --

OLIVE
Can you imagine the dance squad
full of shirtless guys in tight
pants rocking out to Britney while
the football players sit on the
sidelines wishing they were that
cool

BRANDON
Thatll be the day
(Beat)
Judging from the new look youre
sporting Im not the only one in a
transformative stage “Sup with
the whore couture

OLIVE

(PROUDLY)
Havent you heard Im the new
school slut

BRANDON
As a matter of fact I did hear
that I heard you banged a guy
twice your age

OLIVE
No way Hes a freshman in
college
BRANDON
Also heard he gave you crabs

OLIVE
Ewwww People suck

BRANDON

Tell me about it

OLIVE
Hes not real The guy I slept
with I made him up

BRANDON
So you started the rumor

OLIVE
Indirectly Sort of Well not
really No No I didnt

BRANDON
But youre perpetuating it Thats
fucked up

OLIVE
(OFFENDED)
Excuse me

BRANDON
Its true Theres only one thing
worse than these tabloid-chasing
celebutantes with their vapid minds
and their immoral souls and thats
the people who want to be like
them

OLIVE
Did I say I wanted to be like them

BRANDON
No you just want everyone else to
think you are

OLIVE
Why does it matter if its not who
I really am No offense Brando
but maybe you could learn something
from me
BRANDON

Youre saying I should pretend to
be straight so people will like
me What a novel idea You should
do seminars Oh wait a minute I
forgot In high school
EVERYBODY PRETENDS TO BE SOMETHING
THEYRE NOT

OLIVE
Calm down Adolph Theres a vein
popping out of your neck Im
simply suggesting that maybe these
kids we call peers have got the
right idea Maybe Bridget
Schumacher isnt as hippy-dippy as
she pretends to be Maybe thats
just the label shes put on herself
to avoid having to bathe as often
as society deems necessary Or
take Marianne Bryant Its
convenient for her to act like a
stuck-up Jesus-freak
(Thinking about this)
No Im wrong I think shes
actually just a stuck-up Jesus-—
freak But do you think she cares
that thats the way shes
perceived No Maybe she was just
sick of being just another
nameless faceless entity in a
place and a time that reveres
people for extremity

Brandon realizes why shes chosen this path and feels for
her

BRANDON
There are some of us though that
want to just blend in to the crowd

OLIVE
Then maybe you need to go to that
extreme Or make the steadfast
decision not to care Even better
if you can manage to do both
(Beat)
Ive discovered an infallible
remedy for teen angst apathy
BRANDON
I cant decide if youre a genius
or a lunatic

OLIVE
Dont they sort of go hand-in-hand

She smiles sinisterly at him

BRANDON
Funny I always thought teen angst
and apathy went hand in hand

There is an electricity in the air and it seems as if at any
moment they might fling off their clothes and screw right
there

OLIVE
How am I doing

BRANDON
What Pretending to be a whore
For a virgin Im impressed How
about me Could I pass as
straight

OLIVE
Not bad For a fag

BRANDON
I prefer the term “turd burglar

They both break character and return to being themselves

OLIVE
If we really wanted to shock the
world wed get up and leave

detention

BRANDON
But you know that we would never do
that

OLIVE

Isnt going to stop me from telling
everybody we did

Brandon thinks hard about everything thats just been said
His brain is going a-mile-a-minute In that noggin an idea
has been planted
Olive not oblivious to this returns to her novel

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Olive lounges on her bed flipping through a magazine and
talking to Rhiannon on the phone

RHIANNON (0S)

Brandy Carter was telling Vanessa
Hodges that you lost your virginity
to three guys in a jacuzzi

OLIVE
Well I guess thats better than me
getting crabs from a guy twice my
age

RHIANNON (0S)
Ewww Who said that

OLIVE
You know that Brandon kid

RHIANNON (0S)
From your seedy pre-pubescent
closet romp

OLIVE

RHIANNON (0S)
Nobody talks to him

OLIVE
Isnt that sad Hes actually
quite the conversationalist

RHIANNON (0S)

OLIVE

Olive clicks over to Rhiannon

OLIVE

RHIANNON (0S)
Probably wants to borrow an outfit

OLIVE
Thats so mean

RHIANNON (0S)
Any word from George

OLIVE
Rhi I told you It was a one
night stand Which is now a DONE
night stand

RHIANNON (0S)

Youre being awfully cavalier about

cherry Arent you supposed to be
eternally in love with him and

OLIVE

If I was a character on a CW show
then absolutely Id be blubbering
all over my Teen Vogue Hey we

aving a pregnancy scare

Olive is stoked by her idea

INT FOYER - PENDERGHAST HOME - NIGHT

Rosemary opens the door to see Brandon She has no idea who
he is

BRANDON
Hi Is there an Olive here

ROSEMARY

(FEIGNING CONFUSION)
Theres a whole jar of them in the
fridge

BRANDON
Sorry I must have gotten the
address wrong

ROSEMARY
Just kidding Come on in

Brandon walks in and Rosemary shouts --

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
Olive sweetie theres a young man
here to see you He said something
about asking for your hand in
marriage

Brandons eyes bulge and Olive descends the staircase

OLIVE
Oh happy day Mama I thought I was
going to have to spend my dowry on
booze and pills to numb the
loneliness

Olive grabs Brandon by the hand and leads him upstairs to --

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
She closes the door behind them

OLIVE
My moms an acquired taste I know
this because Ive only just
recently begun to appreciate her
myself

She gestures for him to sit down

OLIVE (CONTD)
Welcome to my boudoir This is

where the magic happens

BRANDON
(BLURTING OUT)
Do you wanna go out with me

She looks at him strangely

BRANDON (CONTD)
I mean like -- Do you want to be
my girlfriend

OLIVE
Brandon just a few hours ago you
told me you were Kinsey Six gay

BRANDON
True But you said I should
pretend to be straight

OLIVE
Well I didnt mean with me
Youre a sweet guy and all but
youre not really my type

BRANDON
Youre not really my type either

OLIVE
I should say not

BRANDON
Okay Well do you wanna have sex
with me

OLIVE
Youre serious

He nervously nods

OLIVE (CONTD)
Oh my God dude You totally
missed my point All I was saying
was that --

BRANDON
No I know what you were saying I
should play it straight until I get
out of this hell and then I can be
whoever I want to be No I got
that

OLIVE
Brandon I didnt REALLY have sex
with a college guy I just told
people I did

(MORE)

OLIVE (CONTD)

(CONSIDERS THIS)
Well actually I just told one
person and - well - you know how
these things work

BRANDON
So youre saying I shouldnt
really have sex I should just say
I had sex with someone A girl

OLIVE
Now youre cooking with gas

Its his turn to smile slyly at her She sees where hes
going with this and instantly gets defensive

OLIVE (CONTD)
Oh no Oh no no no no no no no no
No Really No No way No
No
BRANDON
Think about it We could help each
other out You want to maintain
this floozy facade I want to not
get my face pummelled weekly

OLIVE
You are on crack

BRANDON
All it would take is one good
imaginary fuck and youd be saving
the bone structure of my face
Think of how happy my parents would
be

OLIVE
This is not the answer Why dont
you just do what I did and make
someone up

BRANDON
Who would believe me

(GROWING INCREASINGLY

DESPERATE)
Listen Olive I dont want to do
this I want to live in that not-
too-distant EMO world but I still
have another year of this bullshit
place and I cant do it I just
cant do it
(Beat)

(MORE)

BRANDON (CONTD)
Ill pay you I can pay you
whatever you want

OLIVE
(GENTLY )
I just dont think it would work

BRANDON
Whores arent discerning Olive
And just think - youll OFFICIALLY
be a hooker with a heart of gold

OLIVE
I dont want your money

BRANDON
I insist

OLIVE
So if I say yes youre going to
tell a couple of people at school
and I just have to go with it I
really dont think it will work

BRANDON

(His voice cracking with
EMOTION)

I can make it work I promise

She sees tears forming in his eyes

She walks away from him and is silent for a long few
moments

OLIVE
I dont do anything half-assed
(Spinning around to face

HIM)
Itll have to be a public event
Melanie Bostic is having a party
tomorrow night All of your
tormentors will be there You and
I are going together You have to
do everything I say AND you have to
tell people that I was sensational

Brandon wipes his tears away and is the happiest gay youve
ever seen He throws his arms around her and wont let go

BRANDON
I cant believe youre doing this

OLIVE
Afterwards its up to you Youre
committing to something

(MORE)

OLIVE (CONTD)
Just make sure youre ready to live
with the consequences
It seems as if that last statement was more for herself than

it was for him

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY
Into the webcam --

OLIVE
Im sure you all remember the
party

INT BOSTIC HOUSE - NIGHT

A TEEN PARTY rages DRUNK KIDS abound

Olive looking like a million-fuckin-bucks prances into
the

party with Brandon whos looking pretty snazzy himself

They appear drunk and are falling all over each other

People stare in complete amazement at a) Their appearance
and b) That theyre even together in the first place

Youd never guess that this was anything less than an A-LIST
TEEN COUPLE ripped from the pages of Teen People

Olive falls against Brandon laughing He hoists her up as
their host MELANIE BOSTIC a fairly pretty girl
approaches

MELANIE
Hey Olive

(WEIRDED OUT)
Hi Brandon

OLIVE
OhmiGod Melly I hope you dont
mind but we had a few pre-cocktail
party cocktails

(DISORIENTED)
Party Cocktails

MELANIE
Well glad you could make it

OLIVE
(Whispering and slurring
in her ear)
Soooo heres the thing
(MORE)

OLIVE (CONTD)
Brandon was in the middle of
telling me this funny thing Is
there a quiet room we can go to
where he can finish telling me --
(HICCUP)
-- About his thing Thats funny

She stares glassy-eyed at Melanie Brandon just smiles

MELANIE
Sure You can use the guest room
Down the hall

OLIVE
I love you I love you so much
You are -- Just yeah

She gives her a drunken punch on the shoulder

She spins around to the entire party who is looking at them
with complete interest

OLIVE (CONTD)
(Loudly to all)
Hey everybody

They raise a glass to them and Brandon and Olive stumble
down
the hallway laughing

MELANIE

(Shocked Mouthing to a
GUEST)
What the fuck

The bully who emerged from Gibbonss office with Brandon
goes up to Melanie

BULLY
Was that Olive with Brandon

MELANIE
I know Right

They with a big group race down the hall where Brandon and
Olive have just retreated to

INT GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

Olive locks the door and drops the drunk act Shes

completely sober and so is Brandon

at

‘The

bed

OLIVE
(WHISPERING)
Draw the shades

Brandon runs over and pulls the blinds down They giggle
conspiratorially

Olive plops down on the bed and stretches out Brandon lays
beside her She moans for the benefit of the audience she
knows has assembled outside She moans again and its very
convincing

She leans over and whispers in his ear --

OLIVE (CONTD)

Grunt Make it really convincing

And manly

He does so She extends her palm impressed He slaps it
with his

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Sure enough it seems as if most of the party is listening
the door - falling all over each other to hear Nearest to

the door is the bully who is pleasantly surprised by the
noise inside

INT GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Olive reaches into her handbag and pulls out her copy of
Scarlet Letter and reads it while she makes sex noises
Brandon laughs at this and Olive smacks him with it
prompting him to stop She puts her finger over her lips

giving him the Shhhh sign

She continues to read as she thrusts her hips making the

squeak ever so slightly

BRANDON
(WHISPERING)
How long do we have to do this

OLIVE

(WHISPERING)
Depends Do you wanna be a normal
adolescent boy or do you wanna be a
stud

He moans in his deepest voice She continues to read
crescendoing her moaning like a pro

OLIVE (CONTD)
Oh God Brandon Dont stop
Dont stop Dont stop dont
stop dont stop

She takes the top of the headboard and lightly taps it
against the wall over and over

OLIVE (CONTD)

(WHISPERING)
Now that I think about it we
probably dont want to do this for
too long Itll give the
impression that youre having
difficulty finishing Thats not
the desired effect

BRANDON
(WHISPERING)
Are you sure youre a virgin

OLIVE

(WHISPERING STERNLY)
Of course I am

(LOUDLY )
Oh fuck me Fuck me Dont stop
fucking me

Brandon suppresses a laugh

INT GUEST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Olive is disheveling herself Brandon musses up his hair

OLIVE
Hold on

She unbuttons Brandons shirt and rebuttons it incorrectly
OLIVE (CONTD)
Go forth my son Youre a man

now

BRANDON
arm

Thanks Olive

He kisses her on the cheek and she smiles

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The whole crowd leaning against the wall quickly disperses
when the door opens

The bully immediately hands Brandon a beer and throws his

around him leading him drunkenly down the hallway with a
crew of guys after the dirty details

Olive looks at this and smiles satisfied Then she realizes
that though the guys have gone there are a whole slew of
girls looking at her completely differently They avoid her
eye contact as one would ward off Medusa

Olive finds Melanie pretending not to be interested in her

OLIVE
s there a --

MELANIE
Back entrance is through the
itchen

OLIVE

Thanks

She begins her walk of shame down the corridor into the --

INT KITCHEN

-- Where she runs smack-dab into the well-developed chest of
MEERKAT TODD

MEERKAT TODD
(POLITELY)
Sorry

They make eye contact Olive is a sick shade of regret

MEERKAT TODD (CONTD)
Oh hey Olive

OLIVE
Hi Todd

Obviously oblivious to the demonstration that just occurred

MEERKAT TODD
Hows it going

OLIVE
IM --
(She doesnt know how she
Is)
Im here

MEERKAT TODD
Can I get you a beer

OLIVE
That rhymed

Olive catches the reflection behind her of a group of guys
leaning against the counter signalling “NO DONT DO IT to
him behind her back

She spins around and they instantly pretend to not be paying
attention She glares at them

OLIVE (CONTD)
(Ashamed of herself)
I should probably go

She rushes off

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

OLIVE
It was truly my Cindy Mancini
moment
(MELODRAMATICALLY
REENACTING)

“You Even Bobby thinks we went
out Great huh Ha All of you

joke Ronald Miller paid me
1000 bucks to pretend I liked him
What a deal huh 1000 to go out

God He bought me And he bought
all of you He was sick and tired
of being a nobody Yeah and he
said that all of you guys would
worship him if we went out And I
didnt believe that I was like
no way And he was right No leave
me alone He was right Our little
plan worked didnt it Ronald The

bunch of followers you guys are I

got paid

(Sincerely as herself)

“Cant Buy Me Love is one of the
best movies ever made Hands down
You guys should totally watch it if
you havent already Or even if

you have Seriously fine
filmmaking

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - DAY

Olive lays on her bed watching the scene from “Cant Buy Me
Love that she just performed She eats a candy bar and
wallows in her self-pity

OLIVE
(To the television)
Oh Cindy Mancini It could have
been a lot worse Trust me

Her mom comes in with a nicely-wrapped gift

ROSEMARY
That kid from the other night just
dropped this off for you

Indicating an empty space on the floor --

OLIVE
Put it on the pile of gifts from my
other suitors

ROSEMARY
He seems like a nice boy Gay

OLIVE
A dyed-in-the-wool homosexual that
boy is
Rosemary puts the gift on the floor

ROSEMARY
I dated a homosexual in high
school

OLIVE

Were not dating Mom

ROSEMARY
I just wanted to tell you that if
you want to date a gay boy it
might be hard on your father and I
at first But we love you no
matter what the sexual orientation
of your opposite-sex partner

Rosemary leaves chuckling at her own joke

Too curious Olive opens the gift She withdraws a PHOTO of
the BULLY holding BRANDONS LEGS while he does a KEG STAND
She smiles pleasantly

She pulls out a PINK VIBRATOR and looks at it quizically

Theres an envelope inside She opens it and pulls out a
200 Gift Card to TARGET

OLIVE (VO)

Cindy Mancini gets 1000 I geta
vibrator and a 200 Gift Card to
Target

Theres a note which she reads aloud to herself

OLIVE (CONTD)
Dear Olive The dildo is just in
case you dont shop at Target
Then you can fuck yourself

Olive breaks out into riotous laughter Shes genuinely
touched by this gift

The phone rings Thinking its Brandon Olive snatches it
up

OLIVE (CONTD)
(EXCITEDLY)
Your package was perfection
RHIANNON (0S)
So its TRUE

OLIVE
Rhi

RHIANNON (0S)
Well its not last nights
conquest

OLIVE
You know I always think its so
ridiculous on TV when someone
picks up the phone and magically
seems to know whos going to be on
the other end I usually preface a
conversation with “hello to avoid
such banalities The one time I
decide to step outside this
convention How are you

INT MALL - DAY

Rhiannon clutching an enormous Diet Coke plods through the
mall with an intensity reserved for girls who just found out
their best friend had her sophomore sexual exploit and
didnt
bother to tell them

RHIANNON
I have many questions obviously

WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO LOCATIONS

OLIVE

(PLAYFULLY)
Yes Virginia there is a Santa
Claus No in fact I do NOT know
the way to San Jose And - little
known fact - contrary to popular
belief panama hats are not from
Panama at all Theyre from
Ecuador Who knew

RHIANNON
Now is not the time to be cute
OLIVE
Youre putting me in a precarious
position because --
(With her best Jackie-O

VOICE)
-- ‘according to last months
Cosmopolitan Magazine we should
always look cute Even when were
doing mundane activities such as
choosing vegetables from the
produce section of our local
grocery store

RHIANNON
Olive stop it This is serious
Did you really bang Brandon last
night at Melanie Dipshits party

Olive sighs as she slumps into her pillows

OLIVE
s that what people are saying
happened
RHIANNON

Thats what EVERYONE is saying

OLIVE
Then I guess its true

RHIANNON
Does this mean you guys are dating

OLIVE

God no

Rhiannon screams in frustration attracting the attention of
passing shoppers

RHIANNON
Just because you lost your
virginity doesnt mean you can go
around screwing everybody

OLIVE
(OFF-PUT)
Uh thanks Mom Good talk

RHIANNON
Youre getting a reputation
OLIVE
Yknow youre really coming off as
a little pious right now and youre
kind of pissing me off

RHIANNON
Please forgive my rectitude but I
think that a best friends duty is
to let her know that everyone - and
I do mean everyone - is calling her
a cum dumpster

OLIVE
Well do YOU think Im a cum
dumpster

RHIANNON
Look baby I call a spade a spade

Entering the red zone --

OLIVE
First off thats racist
Secondly fuck you How dare you
I was Laura Ingalls to your Lady
Chatterly and now all of a sudden
YOU feel the need to warn ME that
IM making a fool of myself There
are a lot of children who will
never again experience Family Pizza
Night because of you So why
dont you jump off your high horse
and splash around in the gutter
where you belong

RHIANNON
I didnt want to believe it but I
guess its true Youre a
fucktart

OLIVE
And youre a jealous virgin

RHIANNON
Oh yeah I totally want to lose my
virginity to one of --
(As if it was a disease)
-- your brothers friends and then
be the first for a fairy while
everyone listens outside What is
wrong with you Does sex mean
anything to you

OLIVE
Yes Its a period of time how
ever short that I dont have to
talk to you

She slams the phone down into the cradle and seethes
Berlins “SEX (Im A) plays loudly as

She goes into her closet and starts wildly pulling down
clothes She throws them into a big pile in the middle of
her floor

Rhiannon Abernathy only wishes that
somebody wanted to pretend to sleep

BACK TO

Olive - visibly upset - is cutting something meticulously
out of RED FABRIC In fact she has yards of red fabric
draped across her lap

When she finishes the shape she tosses it behind her and
begins another one

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - LATER

Olive sews these red scraps to her clothes When she
finishes one piece as before she tosses it behind her and

grabs another item from the crumpled wardrobe on her floor

Time flies and we see the clothing pile rapidly decreasing
until there are none left

The song morphs into -- Tommy James and the Shondells
“CRIMSON and CLOVER as we fade into --

Clad in sunglasses fuck-me-boots and looking like a bona

Sewn across her larger and pushed up breasts is

A FIERY RED A

(NOTE For the rest of the film every piece of Olives

Hey Olive

Hi Evan

He gestures for her to follow him underneath the bleachers
She reluctantly does so

EVAN (CONTD)
(WHISPERING)
Dont get mad but Brandon told me
what you did for him

OLIVE
Well rest assured it was equally
as thrilling for me

EVAN
No he told me the truth

Shes pissed She silently seethes

EVAN (CONTD)
And I was just hoping that maybe
you could do the same for me

OLIVE
(Through clenched teeth)
Walk away Evan
Evan starts to talk but she raises her hand to silence him

OLIVE (CONTD)
RUN away Evan

EVAN
I can pay you too

OLIVE
Im about six seconds away from
slapping you so hard that your
unborn grandchildren will feel it

EVAN
(Excited at the prospect)
Can you do it in front of everyone

Olive turns and starts to leave Evan summons up his courage
and meekly states to her back

EVAN (CONTD)
I dont need your permission you
know

She turns around and gives him a look of death He cant
look at her

EVAN (CONTD)
I mean at the rate youre going
Im just saying I dont think
anyone would not believe it

OLIVE
Are you threatening me

EVAN
Ill give you 500

OLIVE
Youre repugnant

EVAN
(Indicating his body)
Thats the problem

And once again Olive feels too sorry for him to say no

OLIVE
I want five hundred dollars in gift
certificate form deposited in my
locker before noon tomorrow
Preferably “The Gap but Ill also
take Amazoncom We did NOT have
sex I was piss-ass drunk and I
let you fondle my chest and it was
a glorious moment for you
unmatched by anything youve
heretofore experienced including
cake Got it

EVAN
Five hundred bucks for just feeling
you up Doesnt that seem a little
steep to you Can you throw in

SOME
(Mispronouncing it as if
it rhymed with ‘cottage)
frottage

OLIVE

(CORRECTING HIM)
Its fraw-TAHZH dumbass

(BUCKLING)
Fine But it was so good you
lasted only twelve seconds and I
better not find out that little
pecker of yours EVER came out of
your pants Take it or leave it

EVAN
Little pecker Nuh-uh For five
hundred dollars it was ungodly
huge You even commented on the
unusual girth for a guy my age

OLIVE
I was too drunk to remember

EVAN
Three minutes

OLIVE
Two

He extends his hand

EVAN
Deal
She repulsed by it shakes his hand Evans ecstatic

OLIVE
The sad thing is Evan if you had
been a gentleman and asked me out
on a date I probably would have

said yes

EVAN
Really Do you want to go ona
date

With zero vitriol --

OLIVE
Not now I dont

Sad for him she walks away

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY
Into the webcam --

OLIVE
Evan if youre watching this -
shame on you I hope you never
treat another girl the way you
treated me or you will die alone
wishing it was because youre fat
And since were playing the shame
game While I appreciate the
sentiment Lewis a pretend hand
job should have warranted a little
more than a hundred dollars worth
of AMC Movie Passes They had an
expiration date AND were only able
to be used for movies that had been
running for two weeks But even
thats better than Tyler Jennings
who gave me a ten percent off
coupon to Bath and Body Works
Seriously A fucking coupon Is
that how good my imaginary blow job
was to you Huh Is chivalry
dead I want John Cusack holding a
boombox outside my window want
Richard Gere climbing up my fire
escape with the limo waiting
downstairs I want to ride off on

a lawnmower with Patrick Dempsey
Although Im ashamed to admit Id
prefer him to look like he looks
now What woman wouldnt But no

I get to save two fifty on a bottle
of Juniper Breeze Hand Lotion
Maybe chivalry isnt dead but its
in a coma and the prognosis isnt
good

I could have chlamydia And I

together Who knows Often times
women dont have symptoms and I
have been whoring around

MRS GRIFFIN
No you havent

Olive looks at her puzzled by her knowledge

MRS GRIFFIN (CONTD)

(LOOKING AWAY)
Because a real whore cant admit it
to herself let alone others

She begins to weep
Olive puts her hand on Mrs Griffins shoulder

OLIVE
Call Micah Tell him I said hes
an asshole and that he owes me SO
big for this and also the time I
pretended not to see him during a
third grade game of hide and seek
Tell him I still remember that
But tell him that I confessed to
giving him chlamydia

Mrs Griffin grabs Olive and cries on her

And its not really my place to say

(WHIMSICALLY)
My boyfriend
(She gets lost in the

THOUGHT)
With all the mythical play I was
getting its a wonder - and
probably a miracle - that I still
hadnt actually been asked out ona
real date Guys were clamoring to
claim that theyd slept with me
but no one was putting the real
moves on me Until finally

EXT PLAYGROUND - YEARS BEFORE

Two LITTLE 5 YEAR OLD GIRLS (Olive and Rhiannon) chase a
LITTLE BOY all over the playground desperate to kiss him

They plot and plan to corner him but hes just too fast

OLIVE (VO)

It was really Rhiannon who had a
crush on him She has since we
were kids
Rhiannon finally catches him and kiss him on the
Repulsed he wipes his face

Rhiannon and Olive high five each other

INT CAFETERIA - DAY

Olive eats her lunch and yuks it up with a table

of girls and glares at her from across the room

The bell rings and the students begin getting up
their way toward the exit

full of

and making

Anson (who we saw earlier with Rhiannon in the hallways)

approaches Olive

ANSON
Hey Olive

Olive smiles sweetly at him

ANSON (CONTD)
I was wondering if you were busy
tonight Maybe wanna go out or
something

OLIVE
(SUSPICIOUS)
What did you have in mind

ANSON
I dunno I was thinking about
chartering a hot air balloon
taking along a bottle of champagne
and fresh fruit and then trying to
impress you with an overzealous
reading of Emily Dickinson

OLIVE

(COYLY)
Why Anson are you inviting me to
accompany you to a romantic dinner
at the Red Lobster

ANSON
Unequivocally

OLIVE
(IMPRESSED)
Nice Yeah Ill have dinner with
you

Olive walks off

INT RED LOBSTER - NIGHT

Olive and Anson sit in a booth at a dimly-lit RED LOBSTER
Olive looks beautiful The “A on her shirt is sequined

OLIVE
I cant believe you brought me to
the nicest restaurant in town
This is swank I was beginning to
think that there was no such thing
as class

ANSON
Yeah Whats better than getting
to select your dinner and have nice
conversation while they boil it
alive in the back

OLIVE
I think Anson Jr doesnt mind
making the sacrifice You dont
mind that I named him Anson Jr do

you

ANSON
Not at all Im actually kind of
honored

OLIVE

Do you believe this whole thing
about lobster being an aphrodisiac

ANSON
(Lying out his ass)
I didnt know it was

OLIVE
Yknow medical science has not
substantiated claims that any
particular food increases sexual
desire or performance Its so
funny when guys ply women with food
that they think is gonna get them
laid I mean whats really sexy
about slurping back oysters You
now native people believed that
you gained the strength of the
animal by consuming it Some
people grind up rhinoceros horn
because its thought to stiffen the
male sex organ Its all bullshit
And spanish fly Its pulverized
beetle that people eat Although
its illegal for human consumption
in the United States and do you
now why Because if you take just
a bit too much it causes painful
urination fever and bloody
discharge

A SERVER appears with their LOBSTER Anson is an odd shade
of green from Olives little science lesson

OLIVE (CONTD)
Yum

The server leaves them and Olive digs in Anson is feeling
nauseous and cant touch his

From across the restaurant a PARADE OF SERVERS enters from
the back enthusiastically clapping and holding a cupcake

Leading the brigade is Meerkat Todd whos wearing a RED
FOAM
LOBSTER HAT

With as much spirit as he has as a meerkat --

MEERKAT TODD
I dont know but Ive been told

PARADE OF SERVERS
I dont know but Ive been told

He leads them through to another part of the restaurant

OLIVE

(TO ANSON)
I didnt know Meerkat Todd worked
here And hes a lobster I
wonder if I should start calling
him Lobster Todd
MEERKAT TODD
Marguerite is getting old

PARADE OF SERVERS
Marguerite is getting old

They land at the table of the birthday girl Olive cranes
her neck to see --

Rhiannon miserable of course sitting with her parents at a
table in the next room Olive immediately becomes uneasy

OLIVE

PARADE OF SERVERS

ANSON

OLIVE

OLIVE

ANSON
(DISAPPOINTED )
Do you want me to get the check

OLIVE
(TOUCHED)
Would you mind

He gestures for the server who appears
ANSON
Could we get our check

SERVER
(CONFUSED)
Is everything okay

OLIVE
I just remembered Im allergic to
shellfish I always forget that my
respiratory system would collapse
and Id die It sucks I know

Even more confused the server obliges and gives them their

check

OLIVE (CONTD)
(Digging in her purse)
Let me get it I have a gift
certificate

She pulls it out and hands it to the waitress

ANSON
But I asked you out

OLIVE
And I ruined it so let me bear the
financial brunt
(Beat)
Im so sorry about this But she

ANSON
She and I just dont have much in

ANSON

I think so For instance I too

Olive suddenly becomes self-conscious and a little bit
pissed

ANSON (CONTD)
Kidding

OLIVE
Yeah about that --

The server reappears with the check

SERVER
You have a remaining balance of
fourteen dollars and thirty six
cents

OLIVE
eep it Tip

The sever smiles and leaves them again

ANSON
Lets get out of here

They duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down
but Olive cant resist the urge to look up and see if
Rhiannon sees them

She does
Olive and Rhiannon make eye contact Whereas Olive looks
remorseful Rhiannon looks like shes just been stabbed in

the back -- which she has

The Abernathys see her as well and wave Its painfully
obvious to Olive that Rhi hasnt told her parents about

differences She starts to go over but Rhiannons face is
turning vermillion in anger Olive just waves sheepishly
and leaves with Anson

IE ANSONS CAR - RED LOBSTER PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Olives face is painted with guilt She feels like shit but
doesnt want to externalize it

Anson puts his hand on her knee
ANSON
I have something for you

Olive manages a smile He reaches into his pocket and pulls
out a 500 GIFT CERTIFICATE to ANTHROPOLOGIE and hands it to
her

Olive is disappointed but tries not to show it

OLIVE
Oh I didnt realize --

Snapping out of her guilt

OLIVE (CONTD)
Okay So what did we do on this
date

ANSON
Whatever 500 gets me

He leans over and kisses her She pushes him off

OLIVE
Wait This isnt how it works I
dont actually --

But hes kissing her again a little too forcibly She
pushes him off again

OLIVE (CONTD)
You dont get it Im not
technically having sex with people
for money You know that right
Besides even if I was were in
the parking lot of a Red Lobster

ANSON
We can go wherever you want but I

think it would be kind of hot here

He takes off his shirt

OLIVE
Dude I gotta go Its been --
sad

She gets out of the car He rolls down the window
ANSON
Olive youre being stupid Ill
take you home

OLIVE
No thanks

He drives off leaving her outside in the parking lot

OLIVE (CONTD)
Fuck

As luck would have it Meerkat Todd is coming out the back
exit He sees her and gives her a surprised toothy grin

MEERKAT TODD
Hey Olive

OLIVE
Hey Todd

MEERKAT TODD

(Laughing at her oddness)
You want a ride somewhere

OLIVE
Nah Im fine

MEERKAT TODD

Tears begin to glisten in Olives eyes

OLIVE
Shes not my friend anymore

Todd walks over and puts his arm around her and leads her to

his car He opens the door for her and she sits down

IE MEERKAT TODDS CAR - NIGHT
Olive is trying to pull

herself together but she cant stop

crying as Todd drives her home

Todd doesnt know what to say to her

MEERKAT TODD
Olive contrary to popular belief

She stops crying

OLIVE

MEERKAT TODD
No one had to tell me All I know
is once upon a time there was a
scared little kid in a closet ata
party who wasnt ready for his
first kiss and there was this
amazing little girl who lied for

She smiles through her tears

OLIVE
You remember that

MEERKAT TODD

OLIVE
And look how he turned out

MEERKAT TODD
Sometimes I still pretend you were

Olives laughter turns to rage

OLIVE

OLIVE
(Off his look)
I mean its not that I dont still

Theres an awkward moment between them

MEERKAT TODD
Olive If I promise not to tell
anyone could I kiss you

Despite the fact that this is positively the most romantic
moment of her young life Olive looks down

OLIVE
No Not tonight I dont want you
to kiss me when mascaras running
down my cheek or some shithead has
forced his tongue down my throat
only a half-hour ago Ive wanted
to kiss you since the eighth grade
but I want it to be perfect And
right now my lifes a mess I
need to get it under control before
I drag you into it

MEERKAT TODD
What if I told you I wanted to be
dragged into it Maybe I could
help

He holds out his hand and she takes it

Olive waits for Mrs Griffins response Theres a long
moment of contemplation on Mrs Griffins part Then --

MRS GRIFFIN

Olive life is full of choices I
made a bad one But then so did
you We both acted unwisely but I
dont see any other alternative
than to live with the guilt My
guilt stems from my indiscretion
yours for lying Weve made our
choices Now we have to ride them
out

OLIVE
(Pissed as hell)
Or I could just tell everyone THE
TRUTH

MRS GRIFFIN

Fine Olive Lets play the ‘who
do you believe game But first
ask yourself if you were an adult
who would you believe

OLIVE
With all due respect Mrs Griffin
youre a fucking cunt

MRS GRIFFIN

Because you helped me once Im not

The gravity of what shes just done sinks in and she
stumbles
OLIVE

Not knowing what to say she runs from his classroom

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY
Olive is mirthless as she proceeds with her story

OLIVE
Looking back thats the thing I

that made me realize how profoundly
Id fucked up

(MORE)

OLIVE (CONTD)
And thats something Ill have to
live with for the rest of my life
With my words even though they
were true I ended a marriage No
kid should have to be burdened with
that

She contemplates this

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

As we saw before Olive sits and plays CONNECT FOUR with
Mr Griffin at his desk Both are looking beaten down and
very depressed and their minds are on everything but the
game

Mr Griffin puts his hand on Olives

MR GRIFFIN
Its not your fault

Olive gets a tear in her eyes She puts a RED CHIP in at the
top and loses the game She reaches over and presses the

lever causing all of the chips to fall on his desk

cut To

THE JENGA SET-UP
Theres a ridiculously tall tower of blocks and they all
fall

down
CUT TO

He rakes the chips and the game into his own cardboard box
full of his things

He smiles and she hugs him -- intensely tears quickly
welling up in her eyes

OLIVE
Im so sorry

MR GRIFFIN
No Its not your fault

They just hold each other Finally Mr Griffin pulls away
and takes his things and starts to leave But then he turns
and says --

MR GRIFFIN (CONTD)
I hope that you and Todd end up
okay

With a Bang

EXT BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
As we saw before --

The Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the
school

with a lot of other kids (and some parents) waving signs on

wooden stakes that say things like

EXPEL OLIVE

EXODUS 2014
SCHOOLS ARE FOR LEARNING NOT FOR WHORING
OLIVE PENDERGHAST IS A WHORE

Rhi is among them as riled up as any

Olive steps out of the school to see the demonstration her
jaw drops

OLIVE
Oh fuck me

Things have gotten WAY too out of hand

INT OLIVES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Olive cries on her bed clutching her teddy bear Rosemary
listens as a good mother does

OLIVE
So now everyone who knows the
truth is either gone or wont fess
up The Cross Your Legs Club is
demanding my head And the messed
up thing is that I wouldnt put it
past Gibbons to expel me

ROSEMARY
I had a similar situation when I
was your age

OLIVE
(IN DISBELIEF)
Everyone called you a whore

ROSEMARY
Yes I had a horrible reputation
and people said awful things about
me But it was true I was a
slut

Olive gives her a suspicious look

OLIVE
Im waiting for you to say
(Imitating her mother)
“Just kidding

ROSEMARY

(EARNESTLY )
No its true I slept witha
whole bunch of people

OLIVE
Mom

ROSEMARY
Well It was a different time

OLIVE
Ewwww

ROSEMARY
I did I got around Before I met
your father I was a garden variety
floozy

OLIVE
Why are you telling me this

ROSEMARY
Because I endured a similar
lynching because of a certain
dalliance

OLIVE
I promise that it was no worse than
Marianne Bryants attack on me

ROSEMARY
Wanna bet It was her mother

OLIVE
Wait what

ROSEMARY
Yep Don Bryant and I got caught
in a very compromising position in
the locker room during a basketball

game
OLIVE
Thats disgusting Hes
disgusting
ROSEMARY

He wasnt back then He was
actually pretty handsome All Im
saying is that MAYBE the reason
that Bryant girl is going after you
is because her mother told her
about me

OLIVE
So the sins of the mother are
revisited on the daughter

ROSEMARY
Theres something else you should
know This is hard to say but --
Don Bryant is your father
Marianne is your sister

Olive turns white

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
Kidding Well about the sister
thing but not about the Don thing
That happened Actually that
happened a couple of times before
we got caught

Olive punches her mother on the arm whos laughing
hysterically

OLIVE
I hate you so much right now
Cant you see Ima mess

ROSEMARY
No youre not Olive Youre
wonderful And youre going to
handle this the same way that I
did With an incontrovertible
sense of humor

They embrace and Olive gets an idea

OLIVE
Thanks for the pep talk Mom Now
get out I need to make some phone
calls

Rosemary looks slightly concerned by the grin on Olives
face

INT GYM - DAY

We join a pep rally already in progress

The DANCE TEAM attempts to rile up the school with a rousing
rendition of Michael Jacksons BAD

In the stands Rhi sits with Marianne and Nina

MARIANNE
So Olive wasnt at school today

She extends her palms to Nina and Rhi who both slap them
Marianne puts her arm around Rhi

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Im so glad youre with us now

RHIANNON
Me too You guys fucking rock

MARIANNE

We dont say that word Rhiannon

NINA

(HELPFULLY)
Just say ‘effing instead We
effing rock
dressed

and

Marianne nods in agreement however Rhi is confused

RHIANNON
But isnt that just implying the
same word

MARIANNE
Oh Rhiannon We have so much to
teach you Its okay to imply
things

Rhiannon looks at her new best friends who just smile at
her

The song ends and theres a drum roll

RHIANNON

Yay Its time for Meerkat Todd
(SEXUALLY)

I just want to rip that costume off

him and --
Marianne puts her hand firmly on Rhis knee
MARIANNE
Why dont you just not talk for a
while okay hon

Rhi puts her head down

The drum roll ends and Meerkat Todd bounces out in costume
He jumps around enthusing the student body --

But then he goes out of the gym and reenters pushing a
DUMPSTER

The familiar chords of the James Bond theme “Nobody Does It
Better plays from the band

Meerkat Todd opens the lid of the dumpster and Olive

in a glittery and slinky RED DRESS with a BOA draped around
her bare shoulder pops up and croons with a handheld mic

slightly different lyrics

OLIVE
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as me
Baby Im the best

Todd lifts Olive out of the dumpster and she sings her ass
off - and shes quite good

OLIVE (CONTD)
I wasnt lookin
But somehow they found me
I tried to hide from
Your love light
But like heaven above me
The guys who loved me
Are keepin all my secrets safe
tonight

She winks at the audience The guys begin to wolf whistle
and howl at her sheer brilliance

She begins to rub her hands seductively over Meerkat Todds
furry costume eventually unzipping it and taking off the
head to reveal

BLUE DEVIL TODD The crowd goes wild

OLIVE (CONTD)

And nobody does it better

Though sometimes I wish someone
could

Nobody does it quite the way I do
Whyd I have to be so good

She saunters over to Rhi and kisses her on the cheek
leaving
a big red lip mark

OLIVE (CONTD)

The way that they hold me
Whenever they hold me

Theres some kind of magic inside
you

That keeps me from runnin

But just keep it comin

Howd you learn to do the things
you do

She sees that Gibbons is not amused but that doesnt stop
her

OLIVE (CONTD)
Oh and nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
(MORE)

OLIVE (CONTD)
Nobody does it half as good as me
Baby baby
Darlin Im the best

She walks over to a couple of HORN PLAYERS and runs her
fingers seductively over their (uh) instruments

The crowd goes wild - some appalled but most enthused

Olive sashays through the crowd as the MALE TEENS scream and
stuff money down her bodice

OLIVE (CONTD)
Baby youre the best
Darlin youre the best
Baby youre the best

The song ends and Olive takes Blue Devil Todds hand

OLIVE (CONTD)

James “LAID begins to play

Olive goes over to the window and sees Todd below holding
up

a BOOMBOX (a la John Cusack) and theres a RIDE-ON LAWN

Upon seeing this she bursts into laughter but it couldnt
be more romantic
