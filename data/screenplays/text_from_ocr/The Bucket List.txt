THE HIMALAYAS

Wide as all the world Towering and timeless and rumbling
mutely into the sky to scrape the floor of heaven

Were gliding between them as if on a cloud and CARTER’S
VOICE is quiet and humble and yet somehow makes us feel
as though he knows a great many things we don’t

CARTER (VO)
Edward Perriman Cole died in May It was
a Sunday in the afternoon and there
wasn’t a cloud in the sky

One mountain rises above the rest A plume of ice and
snow billows from its wedge-shaped peak which thrusts up
into the jet stream

CARTER (VO) (CONTD)
“Life is not measured by the breaths we
take but by the moments that take our
breath away” Whoever said that knew a
thing or two

We’re MOVING HIGHER now as the mountain looms closer
drawing us up its massive shoulders

CARTER (VO) (CONTD)
Even now I can’t claim to understand the
measure of a life Some people will
tell you it’s how we’re remembered by
history or by the ones weve left
behind Some believe it can be measured
in faith Some say by love Other folks
say life has no meaning at all We’re
only dust in the breeze

CONTINUING over ridges and glaciers towards the peak
CUT TO
A SKI POLE - THRUST THROUGH A CRUST OF FROZEN SNOW

The CLIMBER is wrapped in a hooded mountaineering suit
and his face is protected by an oxygen mask and ski
goggles

With great effort he lifts his right foot and plants it
forward next to the ski pole his thin breath swept away
by the exertion

He pauses and lifts his goggles to his forehead His eyes
are blue and ringed with exhaustion as he turns to take
in the view of the entire world beneath him
CARTER (VO)
What I can tell you is that by any
standard Edward Cole lived more in his
last days on earth than most folks manage
to wring out of a lifetime

Lowering the goggles the climber turns back to the
summit

CARTER (VO) (CONTD)
I know that when he died his eyes were
closed and his heart was open And I
know that he could hear the mountain

The climber plants the second ski pole and takes another
agonizing step as we RISE high above him until he becomes
small on the face of the giant

CARTER (VO) (CONTD)
And I know the mountain heard him in
return

And we slowly FADE TO BLACK
CUT TO

A CIGARETTE ASHING INTO AN EMPTY “CHOCK FULL O’ NUTS”
COFFEE CAN

INT MCCREATH SERVICE CENTER - DAY

CARTER CHAMBERS is a black mechanic in his late 50’s with
a worn but thoughtful demeanor His job is beneath him
and he’s known it for the last 30 years He leans back
against the El Camino he is working on

MANNY (0OS)
So then what happened

His partner MANNY is beneath the car on a roller He
slides in and out of view over course of the following

CARTER
Tesla took his design to the richest man
in town mister JP Morgan

MANNY
The stockbroker guy

CARTER
That’s right Morgan was the major
financier for Tesla’s primary rival a
fellow by the name of Tom Edison
MANNY
No way

CARTER
Between them Morgan and Edison
controlled the entire power grid for New
York Boston Philadelphia and so on

MANNY
(jingling his pocket)
So they had some serious jing

CARTER
They had “serious jing” Which is why
when Tesla walked into Mr Morgan’s
office and unveiled an invention designed
to provide free wireless electricity to
the entire population of the planet -
remember now this is 1912 - Mister
Morgan had no choice but to finance it
immediately

MANNY
Hold up He agreed

CARTER
Without hesitation

MANNY
But wouldn’t free energy put him out of
business

CARTER
Invariably

MANNY
Yo that’s one stupid stockbroker

CARTER
A year later Tesla invited Mr Morgan
out to Long Island where he had nearly
completed the first in a series of towers
which would tap into the Earth and beam
its energy through the air to a nearby
receiver

MANNY
Crazy So what happened
CARTER
Morgan knew the invention would make both
Tesla and himself famous beyond their
wildest dreamschange human history
forever So he did what anyone in his
position would do He went back to his
office made a few phone calls then home
to his wife The next day Tesla
received notice that Morgan had pulled
his funding He was thrown out on the
street and the lab was demolished The
morning papers carried stories about
Tesla’s clinical insanity quoting
“anonymous sources” who claimed to have
seen Tesla consorting with prostitutes
and demons

MANNY
And Morgan protected his company That’s
SO

CARTER

Machiavellian I agree

MANNY
I was gonna say wack but whatever spanks
your monkey What happened to Tesla

CARTER
He became a pariah No one dared cross
Morgan Nikola Tesla lived the rest of
his life in isolation and died in
poverty The proverbial tree that falls
without a sound

MANNY
He never tried to start over

Carter shakes his head as the phone rings

MANNY (CONTD)
Yo that’s a messed-up story

CARTER
Most true stories are Happy endings are
for suckers

Carter lights a new cigarette as he answers the phone

CARTER (CONTD)
This is Carter Hey how was the
interview Oh Well there’s plenty
of fish in the Dr Young

(MORE)
CARTER (CONTD)
What did he wantUh huhWhat does
that mean It can’t be all that bad

He takes a drag of his cigarette then suddenly stops His
expression changes as he listens

CARTER (CONTD)
That’s not possible

He removes the butt from between his lips as smoke
dribbles from his mouth He looks at the cigarette for a
moment then drops it to the floor

ANGLE ON the cigarette butt slowly burning itself out
In the bg Manny pulls himself out from under the car
staring up at Carter

CARTER (0S) (CONTD)
Today That’s no good the team’s got
their first scrimmage before Yeah
No I know Okay Yep Okay

MANNY
Yo what the hell is that

CARTER
(hanging up the phone)
Ah it’s nothing it’s just

He steps on the cigarette as he walks in a daze past
Manny and out the door of the garage into the blinding
day which fills the frame with its white light

COUNTY DIRECTOR (0S)
Come to order Hudson County Planning
Board

DISSOLVE TO

AN EXPENSIVE LOOKING COPPER THERMOS

As the lid is unscrewed releasing a waft of rich steam
which curls up into the waiting nostrils of EDWARD COLE
who inhales deeply

EDWARD
Kopi Luwak It’s the rarest beverage in
the world At a thousand bucks a pound it
better be
INT WESTCHESTER COUNTY PLANNING BOARDROOM - DAY

Across the aisle the COUNTY DIRECTOR is flanked by five
fellow BOARD MEMBERS who go through the minutiae of
beginning the meeting

Edward is in his mid to late 50’s He’s immaculately
dressed and groomed though his Italian suit appears
slightly too large for his gaunt frame

He unscrews a matching cup from the bottom of the thermos
and pours a small amount of the brew before handing it
over to RICHARD one of several executives in Edward’s
retinue

EDWARD
(coaxing with his hand)
First the aroma

Richard bends his head to the cup sniffing it
EDWARD (CONTD)
Note the earthy tones and the complexity
of the body

RICHARD
It’s just coffee right

COUNTY DIRECTOR
Mister Cole

EDWARD
(to Richard)
It’s not ‘just coffee’

Watches Richard take a tentative sip

COUNTY DIRECTOR
Mister Cole We’re ready to begin

EDWARD
(focused on Richard)
Well

RICHARD
(clearly doesn’t get it)
Wow Really uh good

COUNTY DIRECTOR
Mister Cole
EDWARD
(to Richard)
Youre a friggin’ Philistine you know
that

Grabs the cup back and stands to face the board

EDWARD (CONT’D)
Thank you Mister Director fellow board
members Very much appreciate you taking
the time I’m not big on sugarcoat so
youll forgive me if this comes across as
somewhere south of warm and fuzzy
(looks directly at them)

All of you should be immediately and
pointedly fired They should haul you up
by your boot-straps and dump your bloated
salaries into the street The appalling

decline of Jefferson
result of your gross
utter lack of fiscal

COUNTY
I beg your pardon °

Hospital is a direct
incompetence and
erudition

DIRECTOR
This--

EDWARD
Okay I got a deal I’m going to talk for
a few minutes and the moment I speak the
slightest untruth you can shout me down
Good Fair Good Your shop is
hemorrhaging cash Overhead costs are in
the stratosphere Your lease and land
costs were criminally overbid

One of the board members raises his hand to protest but
the County Director waves him off

EDWARD (CONTD)
Donations have atrophied to the point
that you’ve fallen hopelessly behind the
tech curve in research pediatrics
oncology MRI

He pauses and savors a long sip of his Kopi Luwak coffee
eyeballing the board over the rim of the cup until his
eyelids close in ecstasy from the flavor

EDWARD (CONT’D)
Mmmm Put simply your hospital loses
money every time a patient walks through
the door
The board members range from uncomfortable to furious
though none say a word

EDWARD (CONTD)

More truths The Cole Group is the
largest private hospital management firm
in the region We have a proven track
record of corporate governance and exceed
every requirement of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act Our shops maintain state-of-the-
art technology systems and wield
unparalleled clout in negotiating with
unions and the insurance companies
What’s more we’ve privatized fifteen
other public hospitals in the past seven
years each of which now provide the
highest standard of medicine to their
communities

He pours a second cup of coffee and brings it to his
lips

FEMALE BOARD MEMBER
Despite being grossly understaffed

EDWARD
(pausing before drinking)
We employ the best of the best of the
best The stronger the staff the less
need there is for--

Suddenly he coughs into the cup spraying coffee onto
the table

EDWARD (CONT’D)
Excuse me

Pulls a silk handkerchief to his lips as his suits search
their pockets for tissues to wipe the table

COUNTY DIRECTOR
What about beds There have been reports
that you increase the number of beds to
the point of overpopulation

EDWARD
(wiping coffee)
That’s because I run hospitals not bed
and breakfasts The sole concern of my
company is to provide the best health
care in the world which we do
(MORE )
EDWARD (CONTD)
The sole concern of my shareholders who
include three of you I might add is to
turn a profit which as you know we
also do Our methods are stringent and
effective and one has never suffered at
the hands of the other and you know
it Truths The truth is you need me
boys and girlsa fuck of a lot more
than I need--

Coughs into the handkerchief again

COUNTY DIRECTOR
Mister Cole

Edward stares in shock at the ugly puddle of clotted
blood staining the white silk of the handkerchief

CUT TO
INT HUDSON VALLEY ONCOLOGY CENTER - DAY

A pair of elevator doors open at the far end of a long
hallway emitting a hulking man in a tailored black suit
lugging a set of four massive suitcases as he counts room
numbers This is THOMAS

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Thomas barrels in passing a curtained off area near the
door and drops the bags onto the empty bed next to the
window Opening the first suitcase he sets up the room
with practiced efficiency--

He plugs in a cell phone cradle and sets it on the
bedside table along with a hi-tech alarm clock Lines
half a dozen shoes and slippers down the length of the
bed Unloads a stack of thick books on living with
cancer cancer treatment cancer nutrition new cancer
protocols Sets a laptop computer on the table
surrounding it neatly with pens notepads and Post-Its

Places a massive Royal Classic copper coffee siphon on
the window sill along with copper-lined cups and saucers
and spoons and a dark wooden box covered in Arabic
writing and Sumatran customs stickers

VOICES are heard in the hallway - a commotion coming
closer

Thomas quickly removes a vase and flowers He jogs
through the separator curtain and into the bathroom where
he fills the vase with water completely missing the
figure lying in the bed behind the curtain

The noise in the hallway is reaching a fever pitch as
Thomas emerges from the bathroom and nearly loses the
vase as he sees Carter lying in the near bed

CARTER
(eying the flowers)
You shouldn’t have

He’s thin and drawn and hooked up to a network of tubes
and even his eyelashes have fallen out exposing his
sallow skin that’s dappled with angry chemo burns

There are flowers everywhere and the wall behind him is a
collage of get well cards and photos of a girls soccer
team

THOMAS
I uh I’m sorry What are you doing
here

CARTER

You know fighting for my life You

Just as the hallway brigade bursts into the room - seen
in silhouette and through the gap in the curtains - as
doctors and nurses and handlers hover over--

EDWARD (0S)
(from his gurney)
And tell Holcomb I want to know more
about this bleo-maya-something

DOCTOR (0S)
Bleomycin

EDWARD (0S)
Bleomycin Thomas says it eats your
lungs How do I stoke fear in the hearts
of my employees if I’m breathing through
a hole in my throat for the rest of my
life

DOCTOR (0S)
That’s not exactly what--

NURSE (0S)
Were going to move you into the bed now

EDWARD (0S)
I can do it myself goddammit I’m not
dead yet

Then a huge clattering is heard as Edward falls off the
gurney He swears bitterly as the doctors and nurses grab
him quickly and lift him into the bed

EDWARD (0S) (CONTD)
Where the hell is Thomas

THOMAS
You rang my liege

Pushing through the curtains leaving a gap through which
Carter views Edward being slid into bed

EDWARD
You ditched me again

THOMAS
Wishful thinking on my part

EDWARD
You let these people drop me Did you see
them drop me

THOMAS

I wouldn’t lose a testicle over it
EDWARD

That’s funny That’s absolutely goddamn

hysteri--

Lapses into a coughing fit which doubles him over
allowing him a look through the curtains at Carter

EDWARD (CONTD)
Who the hell is that

CARTER
Who the hell are you

THOMAS
(to Edward)
One thing at a time Lean back now

Edward and Carter glare at each other before Thomas
gingerly leans him back into the bed

CARTER (VO)
That was the first I laid eyes on him An
inauspicious beginning to be sure but
most stories begin that way It got
worse before it got better

CUT TO

INT HOLCOMB’S OFFICE - DAY

DR HOLCOMB is tall and ultra-confident with a runner’s
physique and shoulder-length hair He examines Edward’s
brain scan on a light board

DR HOLCOMB
Luckily the tumors appear relegated to
the surface of the brain Shouldn’t be to
difficult to--

EDWARD
I just gave you my left nut if you think
I’m going to let you crack my head open
and--

DR HOLCOMB
Stop talking

EDWARD
(glowering)
Beg your pardon

DR HOLCOMB
This isn’t a skinned knee I can’t fix it
with a band-aid and a lollypop
Choriocarcinoma travels through your
bloodstream which means it’s everywhere
and it has almost finished killing you

They stare each other down Egos facing off Finally
Edward stands

EDWARD
Youll understand if I want a second
opinion

He heads for the door

DR HOLCOMB
You don’t have that kind of time

EDWARD
Go fuck yourself

Walks out
CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

Electric clippers shave smooth avenues onto Edward’s
scalp His mood has not improved

EDWARD
There’s a guy in my room

NURSE SHING continues shaving his head without a
response She’s Asian late-thirties with a quiet
confidence born of years comforting the sick and dying

EDWARD (CONTD)
I said there’s a guy in my room
(points to the curtain)
Right in there

NURSE SHING
Mmmm

EDWARD
I want him moved

NURSE SHING
Mister Chambers bothering you

Pokes her head through the curtain to see Carter lying in
bed reading Robert Massie’s Nicholas and Alexandra

NURSE SHING (CONTD)
Carter have you been bothering Mister
Cole

CARTER

Who the hell is Mister Cole

EDWARD

NURSE SHING
disapproving)
Mmmm
EDWARD

What’s “Mmmm” Is that some kind of
secret cancer code Why don’t you run

NURSE SHING
(brandishing the clippers)
Look bub maybe this is your hospital
but this is my ward and we have strict
rules Two beds to a room No single
rooms No exceptions

EDWARD
(catching himself ina
mirror)
Jesus Yeah those are my rules
(checking her name tag)
Phyllis I wrote the rules

NURSE SHING
Great then you shouldn’t have any
trouble remembering them Dr Holcomb

She walks out leaving him with Carter who is chuckling to
himself Edward glares

CARTER
No offense

EDWARD
(grumbling)
Mmmm

Carter chuckles some more
CUT TO
INT READY ROOM - DAY

Edward’s bald cranium has been clamped into a large
steel halo A laser marks a point on his forehead and Dr
Holcomb marks corresponding dots on his skin with a
Sharpie

DR HOLCOMB
I’m going to ask you to remember
something for me

Edward is staring with disgust at his reflection ina
glass window

EDWARD
Oh yeah what’s that

DR HOLCOMB
The young lion waits in a dream beneath
the cold white lantern

EDWARD
What

DR HOLCOMB
The young lion waits in a dream beneath
the cold white lantern Repeat it back to
me

EDWARD

The young lion waits in a dream beneath
the cold white lantern What the hell
does that mean

DR HOLCOMB

Doesn’t mean anything It’s a memory
test Any time we go near the brain
there’s always a risk This is how we’ll
know if you’ve gone vegetable on us
Again

EDWARD
(seething)
The young lion waits in a dream

CARTER (VO)
Testicular cancer is almost unheard of
for anyone over thirty but then Edward
always despised conformity

CUT TO
INT OPERATING THEATER - DAY

As Holcomb and his surgical team operate on Edward who
lies in fragile stasis

CARTER (VO)
By the morning of the surgery it had
spread so far throughout his body that
the doctors gave him a five percent
chance to livebut then they didn’t
account for how pissed off they’d made
him

PUSH INTO Edward’s inert face which even under sedation
appears annoyed at the intrusion

WHITE DISSOLVE TO

THE PALE FACE OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Peering down at Edward as his eyes open slowly wandering
in their sockets before focusing on the perfect visage
hovering over him Her name is ANNA she’s 26

ANNA
There you are

He struggles to speak

ANNA (CONT’D)
Here

She lifts a glass of water with a straw to his lips He
sips slowly His head is wrapped in bandages

ANNA (CONT’D)
We’ve been so worried You were asleep
forever

EDWARD
How Did it

ANNA
Oh they said it went really well

He coughs She draws back involuntarily uncomfortable
around sickness

He hears a noise and looks over at Carter who is
surrounded by his three children LEE 26 ROGER 23 and
RACHEL 13 His wife VIRGINIA 50s sits at the end of
the bed All are talking quietly over plates of food

ANNA (CONTD)
They are so nice She’s a nurse They
come to eat with him almost every night
I should-- The doctor said to page him
when you woke up

His eyes begin to close again

ANNA (CONTD)
No wait there’s something I have to--

HIS POV FADES OUT

Virginia looks over to see Anna kiss her hand and press
it to Edwards cheek

VIRGINIA
Everything all right dear

ANNA
He fell asleep before I could tell him

VIRGINIA
I’m sure he’1l understand

ANNA
It’s only a few months right It’s not
like I’m never coming back

It’s obvious she’s never coming back

ANNA (CONT’D)
I guess Ill

VIRGINIA
(to her family)
We should probably push off too
(to Carter)
If you need any more books--

CARTER
Nah I’m good all the way up to Stalin

Lays his hand on an impressive stack of books atop his
bedside table all concerning early 20th century Russia

CARTER (CONTD)
Oh Todd Phillips called He was asking
about the--

VIRGINIA
Already took care of it

He nods his thanks Barely meets her eyes

RACHEL
I can’t come on Saturday We’ve got the
semi’s against Newark

CARTER
That’s right Watch out for their front
line and their sweeper likes to take the
ball up the field

RACHEL
All the girls wish you could be there

Virginia puts a light hand on Rachel’s shoulder
cautioning her not to upset him

CARTER
You ladies are much better off without
me Coach Sanders knows ten times more
about the game as I do

RACHEL
Everyone knows that’s not true I love
you daddy

Kisses him followed by her brothers all exchanging
heartfelt “I love yous”

Finally Virginia takes his hand He grasps it briefly
without any intimacy She leans over to kiss him but the
closeness is awkward Her eyes fall as she kisses his
cheek feeling the lack

CARTER (0S)

lingonberries Who is Halle Berry

CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Edward opens his eyes to see the television is turned on
to Jeopardy Carter is sitting up in bed firing the
answers back at the screen

EDWARD
(barely a whisper)
Excuse me
(stronger )
Excuse me
(a hoarse shout)
I beg your pardon

CARTER
Huh Oh
(lowers the volume)
Doc wanted you to wake up said I
shouldnt pussyfoot

Just as Dr Holcomb enters like a zephyr

DR HOLCOMB
So it couldn’t have gone better We got
in got out and the tumor came back
benign All that remains now is to make
sure you’re not mentally--

EDWARD
The dumbass lion waits in a dream beneath
the stupid white lantern

Dr Holcomb nods approvingly Marks the chart

DR HOLCOMB
Surliness is a good sign How’s the
catheter feel

He checks the integrity of the bulging plastic drain
implanted into the center of Edward’s sternum

EDWARD
Like someone took a dump in my chest

DR HOLCOMB

(barely listening as he

scribbles on the chart)
Wonderful Okay we saved your brain now
were going to kill your body Your
markers are through the roof so I’d like
to begin the first course of chemo in the
morning Good

EDWARD
I can’t wait

Dr Holcomb’s expression does little to hide the fact
that Edward has no idea what he’s in for Holcomb surges
for the door

CARTER
Say Doc Do you think you could-

DR HOLCOMB
I’m sorry I’m running late

Walks out

CARTER
(to Edward)
Real Mother Theresa that one

Edward tries to sit up but is held in place by the web of
tubes running in and out of his body

CARTER (CONT’D)
I wouldn’t do that if I were you

EDWARD
I have a choice

Carter turns back to Jeopardy Edward takes a moment to
accept his situation then turns his head and studies
Carter

EDWARD (CONTD)

How long have you been here

CARTER
What is the quadratic equation

(to Edward)

Huh Oh in and out for the last few
months

EDWARD
Has it been uncomfortable

CARTER
Which part

EDWARD
The chemo

CARTER

They say it’s different for everyone
Once you get used to the ‘round the clock
vomiting and watching your veins turn
black and the feeling that your bones are
made of napalm it’s not bad at all

EDWARD
(paling slightly)
Fantastic
CARTER
Say I been meaning to ask you what the
hell is that contraption over there

Points over to the high-tech coffee maker

EDWARD
It’s a siphon Makes coffee

Fumbles his hand for the nurse call button

CARTER
I figured that much What else it do

EDWARD
Nothing Just coffee

CARTER
I’1l be damned Did you know that
coffee was originally discovered by a
shepherd in Ethiopia

Edward just stares at him Carter continues as much
for his own pleasure as for Edward’s edification

CARTER (CONTD)
His goats had been eating the cherries of
an unfamiliar bush and soon became
unmanageable running and jumping all
over creation The shepherd chewed some
of the leaves which gave him a strange
vitality so he took some branches to the
local monastery where the abbot decided
to roast them When the cherries started
to burn the beans inside produced such a
pleasant aroma that they brewed them into
a stew which eventually spread to
Columbia Asia even Sumatra like that
hooch you got over there

EDWARD
It’s called Kopi Luwak

CARTER
I know what it is

EDWARD
You’ve tried it

CARTER
(makes a face)
Not even if I was dying of thirst in the
Gobi desert

EDWARD
Why not it’s the most expensive--

CARTER
I’m more of an instant coffee man

Edward’s IV tubes have become tangled in the call
button Carter rolls his eyes but eases himself creakily
out of bed and shuffles over to untangle them expertly

EDWARD
Your wife’s a nurse

CARTER
Twenty-six years Used to work in this
ward

EDWARD
Retired

CARTER
In a manner of speaking

Hands Edward the call button and shuffles back to his
bed

EDWARD

through his own IV

EDWARD

He’s cut off as Thomas clears his throat loudly

EDWARD (CONT’D)

CARTER

EDWARD

CARTER

EDWARD

CARTER

Edward pops the artichoke in his mouth grinning as he
chews

As his sumptuous dinner hits the floor with the force of
a hurricane He’s moaning and spitting as he climbs out
of bed and makes for the bathroom but his IV tubes jerk

another torrent After a moment he looks up to see
Carter watching him evenly

EDWARD

She heads out as he checks his watch

CARTER (CONTD)

Edward is sitting up in bed haggard but lucid as he
types angrily on his laptop sipping a cup of coffee He
waves his hand dismissively

Carter turns the television on to Jeopardy and becomes
immediately engrossed

CARTER (CONTD)
What is The Great Divide What is

She clears a path then helps him ease into bed

EDWARD
Thank you

VIRGINIA
Mmmm

EDWARD

Mmmm Don’t you people use words anymore
VIRGINIA
You people

EDWARD
Nurses I meant-- Forget it

VIRGINIA
(walking away)
Forget yourself

EDWARD
I beg your pardon

VIRGINIA
You can beg all you want you ain’t
gettin’ it

EDWARD
How dare you talk to me that way

VIRGINIA
I will talk to-- I don’t work for you
anymore “Mister Cole” so don’t think for
a hummingbird heartbeat you put the quake
in my boots with your fat voice because
all you’re doing is taking up oxygen

CARTER
‘Gin-

VIRGINIA

I don’t think so

(back to Edward)
It’s been two days since a doctors
looked in on my husband and you of all
people have the nerve to condescend to
us I’ve been a nurse my entire adult
life with a ringside seat to more human
tragedy than any woman should have to
bear and I’ve learned that the one thing
in this world worse than dying is staring
your life’s end in the face with no one
beside you but a nurse you’ve known for a
week who’s being paid to hold your
hand I don’t wish that on you Mr
Cole I wouldn’t wish it on anyone but I
know what I know about these things and
you might want to make what ever peace
you can with god and give back just a
little bit of the respect you so
desperately demand because as far as I
can tell you are going to die alone

Edward’s eyes betray him for a brief moment just enough
for her to see she’s laid him wide open Her regret is
immediate

She turns to see everyone staring at her including Thomas
who has just entered from the hallway carrying several
Chinese take out bags

THOMAS
Peking Duck

CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The copper coffee maker reflects a single light source in
the otherwise darkened room Edward stares at the machine
from his bed eyes lost in the gleaming metal

The reflection shifts and Edward rolls over to see Carter
adjusting his reading light

EDWARD
What are you reading

CARTER
Book on Robert Smalls

EDWARD
Never heard of him

CARTER
He was a conscripted slave aboard a
Confederate steamship The Planter One
night he and some of the crew smuggled
their families aboard and stole it right
out from under the rebels’ noses He
turned it over to the Union Navy who made
him a captain By the end of the war he’d
risen to the rank of General and later
became the second African-American to
serve in Congress

EDWARD
Quite a life

CARTER
(agreeing)
Quite a life

EDWARD
I don’t like books

CARTER
You’re joking

EDWARD
I never saw the point History’s just
history I’d rather make it than read
about it

CARTER
How’s that coming along Make any yet

EDWARD
I’ve done alright for myself

CARTER
(dubious)
All your dreams fulfilled

EDWARD
Pretty much yes What about you

CARTER
Not exactly We were practically kids
ourselves when my first boy came alone
Young broke and black you take the
first job they offer you Thirty years
goes by in a heartbeat

EDWARD
Would you change it

CARTER
I love my children if that’s what you
mean

EDWARD

I’m sure you do But you’re a smart guy
must have had a plan for your life before
they came along

Carter thinks a moment then reaches into the drawer of
his bedside table and removes his well-worn wallet He
pulls a small square of yellowed paper out from a pocket
and unfolds it gently in his hands

CARTER
I made this in high school Creative
writing class Some kind of exercise to
get us to think about something besides
chasing skirts

He slips out of bed and hands it across to Edward
Hands the

EDWARD
(reading)
“Carter’s Bucket List” You weren’t
much on penmanship

CARTER
Hasn’t improved I assure you

EDWARD
I don’t understand what this is

CARTER
I was trying to be funny I guess It’s a
list of things to do before I kick the
bucket

EDWARD
(still reading)
“Make a million dollars Run for
president”

CARTER
I didn’t say it was realistic

EDWARD
“Help a complete stranger for the good”
How philanthropic

CARTER
(shrugs)
I was sixteen

EDWARD
What’s the one about the mountain

list back

CARTER

(without looking)
“Listen to the mountain and be heard”
That’s from my uncle Second World War
his squadron flew supplies through the
Himalayas into China Called them the
Hump Pilots Most non-combat casualties
of any unit in Air Force history You
can honestly say you’ve accomplished
everything you ever dreamed about

EDWARD
(shrugs)
I’m a millionaire a dozen times over
(MORE)

EDWARD (CONTD)
I grew my company from the ground up
built my own house sold it built a
bigger house

CARTER
Money ain’t everything

EDWARD
No but it sure takes the edge off being
miserable all the time

CARTER
What about your wife

EDWARD
Which one We’re talking about dreams
not nightmares

CARTER
There’s got to be something you haven’t
done

EDWARD
Dreams are for teenagers Let’s face it
weve had our time and we did what we did
with it We’re all out of wishes The
genies left our magic lamps a long time
ago

CARTER
(after a beat)
Suit yourself

He gets back into bed and slips the list between the
pages of his book Edward watches him for a moment then
turns back to staring at the coffee maker

CUT TO

THE SOUNDS OF A BASEBALL GAME

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Carter hides behind the sports section of a local
newspaper highlighting pieces of an article on the Essex
girls soccer team

EDWARD (0S)
Come on you pansies it’s one out how
hard can it be

Carter lowers the paper just enough to reveal Edward
lying on his stomach with his head propped on a pillow at
the foot of the bed stretching his tubes and cables to
the limit as he yells at the Yankee game on the TV

A Red Sox player bloops a single Edward is beside
himself

EDWARD (CONTD)
That’s just That’s I can’t take
much more of this

Carter’s feelings are commensurate as he puts on a pair
of head phones and listens to Mozart’s Requiem Lacrymosa

He finishes the article and reaches down for a second
newspaper when he sees Holcomb standing at the foot of
Edward’s bed Holcomb’s face is pinched and somber as he
speaks Edward listens implacably his face impossible
to read

Carter slides the headphones off to listen

DR HOLCOMB
Were not giving up There are some
experimental programs we’re conducting
and I think you’d be an excellent--

EDWARD
Doc

DR HOLCOMB
--candidate It’s cutting edge medicine
The odds are against you but-

EDWARD
Doctor Holcomb

DR HOLCOMB
Yes

EDWARD
Youre blocking my view

DR HOLCOMB
Oh Sorry

Holcomb steps to the side of the television Stares for a
beat

DR HOLCOMB (CONTD)
Well if you have any questions

Waits another beat then starts for the door

EDWARD
(eyes never leaving the
screen)
One question

DR HOLCOMB
Of course

EDWARD
Carter

CARTER
Yeah

EDWARD

‘Something you needed from Dr Holcomb

DR HOLCOMB
I’m sorry I’m not Mister Carter’s--

EDWARD
You are now

Holcomb stares at him but Edward’s attention never leaves
the screen Finally Holcomb lifts Carter’s chart from
the foot of the bed and flips through several pages
After several moments his shoulders drop and he looks up
at Carter and shakes his head slowly

DR HOLCOMB
I’m sorry Mister Carter According to
this your markers haven’t stabilized

Carter takes it in though it’s the answer he expected

CARTER
How long

DR HOLCOMB
Several months A year if you’re lucky
As I was just telling Edward we have an
experimental program which has had some
very positive--

CARTER
Sure Doc Whatever you think

DR HOLCOMB
I’m truly sorry

Carter just nods and replaces the headphones over his
ears as Holcomb makes his exit

CARTER (VO)
There was a survey once a hundred people
were asked if they could would they
want to know in advance the day of their
death Out of the hundred ninety-six of
them said no

Carter closes his eyes as the music washes over him

CARTER (VO) (CONTD)
I never understood that I always thought
it would be liberating knowing exactly
how much time you had left to work with

A tear escapes onto his cheek and he looks over at Edward
who is staring back at him over his shoulder

CARTER (V0O) (CONT’D)
So now I knew

Neither says a word and Edward finally turns back to the
game

FADE OUT
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
CLOSE ON CARTER fast asleep A square of sunlight moves
across his eyes until he opens them and squints into the
white light He rolls over away from the window and face-
to-face with a single sheet of yellowed paper propped up

against his tower of books

He pulls the paper close to his eyes and sees the title
“EDWARDS BUCKET LIST”

CARTER
I’1l be damned

Just as Edward bustles out of the bathroom arms filled
with toiletries

EDWARD
Thought you’d never get up

CARTER
‘Time is it

Edward dumps the toiletries in his half-packed suitcase

EDWARD
Six twenty-four I’ve been up since--
I’ve had a lot on my mind

CARTER
(re the paper)
So I see
EDWARD
Not bad huh
CARTER
(reading)

A hot dog eating contest “Kiss the most
beautiful woman in the world” How you
figure on doing that

EDWARD
That’s one of the tough ones We’11
figure it out

CARTER
Don’t take this the wrong way but these
are a littleshallow

EDWARD
You’re out of your mind there’s some
great stuff on there What kind of tattoo
do you think I should get

CARTER
None actually I think you
misunderstood-

EDWARD

No I understood you perfectly Your
whole unfulfilled dreams thing is great
for someone with a few decades in front
of him but I’m looking at weeks months
if I’m lucky

(as Thomas enters

bewildered)
About time

Thomas turns and walks out Edward goes after him pushes
him back into the room

EDWARD (CONTD)
Pack it up Tommy We’re blowing this
popsicle stand
(to Carter)
(MORE)

EDWARD (CONTD)
Your list was a little unrealistic so I
took the liberty of paring it down a
little

Turns the paper over revealing Carter’s original list
which now has several of the items crossed off in red ink
- “Run for President” etc

CARTER
What did you-- You had no right--

EDWARD
I got them both down to ten a piece so if
we budget our time properly we should be
able to bang ‘em all out before one of us
kicks it

THOMAS
(with an armful of business
suits)
Did you want these arranged by color as
usual or--

EDWARD
Forget ‘em I’m only about comfort from
here on out I dunno give ‘em to some
orphans or something

THOMAS
Orphans You’ve been mixing medications
again

CARTER

You don’t seriously think-- I was being
metaphorical you know taking stock
trying to understand something about--

EDWARD
Blah blah blah Metaphors are for tea-
drinkers who read poetry out loud to
their sister You said yourself you
haven’t done anything This is your last
chance

CARTER
To make a fool of myself

EDWARD
To have your own life To spend what time
you have left remembering what it feels
like to have a future rather than
wallowing in the past as a guinea pig in
Holcomb’s bullshit science experiment

Carter stares at the floor his mind racing

CARTER
You think it’s bullshit

EDWARD
You know it is What do you think
Tommy You’re in our shoes what would
you do

Carter looks up at Thomas who thinks for a moment

THOMAS
I think it’s the dumbest idea I’ve ever
heardand you’re fools if you don’t do
it

Carter stares at him
INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

Empty save for a slow-moving nurse or two until Edward
bursts out of the room with a full head of steam followed
by Thomas once again laden with luggage and Carter who
carries a small bag and an armful of books

Edward makes for the elevators as Carter struggles to
catch up to him

CARTER
What about my family

EDWARD
What about them

CARTER
I can’t just abandon them

EDWARD
Why because you’ve been doing such a
great job supporting them from the cancer
ward

CARTER
No I just--

HALL NURSE
(rushing to stop them)
Excuse me Excuse me Where do you think
youre going
EDWARD
(not breaking stride)
We’re checkin’ out Tell Holcomb he can
take his experimental program and shove
it where the sun don’t shine

Nurse Shing comes out of the Nurses Station

She stops at the elevator door as the other three pack

inside

NURSE SHING
I’m sorry Mister Cole we can’t let you
leave without--

EDWARD
Without a doctor’s written authorization
Also my rule

NURSE SHING
Then youll understand my need to enforce
it

EDWARD
Certainly In fact Tommy here’s got a
doctorate in What the hell’s it in
again

THOMAS
Education

EDWARD

Education fantastic

(to Thomas )
Really education What the hell you
doing working for me again

THOMAS
If I had a nickel for--

EDWARD
Anyway Nurse Phyllis Seeing as section
fourteen paragraph three of Cole
Medical’s operations guidelines fails to
stipulate the kind of practitioner
necessary to facilitate a release Doctor
Tommy promises to return with a note
granting us our freedom post haste

EDWARD (CONTD)
(taking Carter’s books)
You won’t be needing those

CARTER
(to Nurse Shing)
Tell my wife--

He’s cut off as the doors close
EXT HOSPITAL - DAY

Edward helps Thomas load the luggage into the trunk of
the waiting limousine

EDWARD
It’s not like we’re flying off around the
world at least not at first I figure we
knock out the ones we can do locally
before heading over to Europe then
Africa and--

CARTER
I can’t go to Africa

EDWARD
Why not I thought all black people dream
of going back to the homeland
CARTER
It’s not that It’s-- I’ve never been on
an airplane
EDWARD
(climbing inside the limo)
You’re joking me
CARTER
(stopping at the door)
No I’m not

EDWARD
You shouldve put that on the list

He pulls Carter inside and the door closes

CARTER (VO)
And so it began

As the big limo roars away the sound of which becomes
THE ROAR OF AN ENORMOUS CROWD
CUT TO

EDWARD AND CARTER - IN THE CENTER OF THE THRONG

Edward is electrified with nervous energy while Carter
looks like he’d rather be anywhere else

EDWARD
Okay so I figure middle of three then we
go You ready

CARTER
No

EDWARD
Good

He along with everyone else around them looks off in
the distance

CARTER
I want to go back I’m serious have
your man-- Where is he
(looking around)
Have him take me back to the hospital

EDWARD
Forget it

CARTER
(grabbing him)
No you forget it This isn’t rational

EDWARD
Of course it’s not rational that’s why
it’s so exciting
(the crowd groans)
That’s our cue You ready

CARTER
No

Edward starts unbuttoning his shirt

EXT YANKEE STADIUM - NIGHT

As the Yankee outfielders jog out to their positions The
crowd suddenly ROARS as the left fielder passes a naked

man who is jogging and waving across the grass

Carter holds Edward’s clothes staring in disbelief as
Edward takes a victory lap towards right field

CARTER
Oh lord

Stadium security guards hustle out after Edward forcing

him to veer towards deep center field The crowd boos as
it appears they have him trapped until he throws a fake

on one of his pursuers who trips in the grass much to the
crowds delight

Edward’s headed back into left but the NYPD has joined
the chase and they’re closing in fast Edward tries
another fake but he’s tackled by a burly police officer
who brings him to the ground

A second officer helps bring Edward’s arms behind his
back when something suddenly knocks him off his feet and
into his fellow officer

INT CARTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rachel does her homework while Roger studies for the L-
SATS The ball game is turned down low on the television
Rachel is stuck on a particularly heinous geometry
equation when her brother starts smacking her arm

RACHEL
Ow What’d you do that for

ROGER
Look

He turns the volume up on the television where Carter is
seen streaking away from the fallen policemen clutching
his genitals with a look of incredulous fear on his face

Brother and sister share a look before-

RACHEL ROGER

EXT YANKEE STADIUM - NIGHT
Edward streaks after Carter whooping and hollering
Carter is actually beginning to enjoy himself until he

pulls up short Edward comes to a stop next to him

SEVERAL DOZEN security and police officers

CUT TO

The NIGHT SERGEANT barely looks up from his paperwork as
he hands her a clipboard

Sign here

She is less than pleased
INT POLICE BOOKING ROOM - NIGHT

As Virginia counts out several hundred-dollar bills then
hands them to waiting BOOKING OFFICER

And if you could sign here that should
do it

Again Virginia signs her name where instructed as the
officer speaks into a microphone

BOOKING OFFICER (CONT’D)

Virginia walks to a chair across the room from where
Edward waits dressed in prison pajamas and Thomas’
overcoat

EDWARD
For the record it was my fault I talked
him into it

VIRGINIA
He’s not a grown man

EDWARD
Even so I’d like to pay you back for the
bail if--

VIRGINIA

That’s not necessary

EDWARD
Really it’s the least I can--

VIRGINIA
Youve done quite enough Mister Cole
Carter spent thirty years killing himself
with those cigarettes If the lord sees
fit to give him a second chance I’d like
it to be home with his family where he
belongs not in prison and certainly not
with you

EDWARD
He hasn’t told you

The door to the holding cell opens with a CLANG as Carter
is ushered out by a guard He’s dressed in prison pajamas
and clings to a blanket as he shivers uncontrollably

VIRGINIA
(to Carter)
Told me what

EXT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Virginia wipes tears from her face as she walks
resolutely to her car Carter follows her watching
Edward as Thomas helps him to the limo

VIRGINIA
I’m taking you back to the hospital See
about getting you into Dr Holcomb’s--

CARTER
I can’t

She opens the driver’s side door Carter stops on the
passenger’s side

VIRGINIA
Don’t play with me

CARTER
Gin’ you don’t understand

He sees Edward waiting at the limo door watching Carter

VIRGINIA
(sees Edward watching)

I understand plenty You two think you
can run off and act like children because
your time’s up so nothing matters
anymore Why don’t you tell your children
that See what they have to say when they
find out you’ve given up on them

CARTER
Given up I’ve spent my life giving up
everything to this family Thirty years
greased up under the hood of a car to see
that they didn’t want for nothing And
they didn’t ‘Gin I gave up every last
one of my ambitions and I wouldn’t take
any of it back but if I am gonna die
Id like to go out with some idea of who
I could have beenof who I am

VIRGINIA
You’re my husband

CARTER
I know it I just wish I knew what that
meant anymore

He turns and walks over to the limo He takes a last look
at his incredulous wife then climbs inside

shuts the blind

CLOSE ON CARTER wearing a helmet and struggling with the
top of a child-proof prescription pill bottle

KYLE (0S)
Need a hand

CARTER

No I got it
(to no avail)
Dammit

Throws the bottle to the floor It rolls towards the
cockpit where Edward is seen from the back talking with
the pilots

CARTER (CONTD)
(about all of it)
Fool So foolish

KYLE (0S)
Wanna try to get it

PULL BACK to reveal KYLE young and brawny sitting
immediately behind Carter In fact Carter is literally
sitting in Kyle’s lap

CARTER
How do you suggest we do that

Kyle stands suddenly - he’s huge about 65” and Carter
is bound to his torso via a series of nylon jump straps
As his feet dangle Carter pitches forward until his
upper-body is almost horizontal while his hips are still
vertically strapped to Kyle

Kyle duck-walks the suspended Carter over to the
prescription bottle Carter extends his arms down but the
bottle rolls out of his grasp and into Edward’s
outstretched hand

Carter looks up at him Edward appears as if he hasn’t
touched a razor in days

CARTER (CONTD)
Not a word
(grabs the bottle)
Back to the chair Kyle

Kyle waddles back to the chair Carter almost hits his
head on the fuselage

EDWARD
(to Kyle)
Youll have to forgive him Kyle He’s on
the outs with the wife

KYLE
(sympathetic hand on Carter’s
knee )
Been there man

CARTER
Some things are not up for discussion

EDWARD
I understand

The CO-PILOT comes out and straps himself to Edwards
back

CO-PILOT
Thirty seconds to drop
EDWARD
(to Carter)
She’s tough your wife That’s good The
Sequel was tough like that

CARTER
The Sequel

EDWARD
The second Mrs Edward Cole God that
woman hated me

CARTER
(sarcastic)
I can’t imagine why

KYLE
Maybe because he called her The Sequel

CARTER
Thank you Kyle

EDWARD
Know what I learned That independence is
the only true gauge of human virtue what
aman is and what he makes of himself
Not what he has or hasn’t done for
others

As the Co-Pilot pulls the door open filling the cabin
with whipping wind Kyle stands and moves them closer to
the door Carter eyes the abyss outside Edward is
nonplussed

Edward watches them fall away then dons his goggles

EXT SMALL AIRPLANE - DAY

As they leap from the plane free-falling into the ether
Everything goes quiet save for the flapping of their jump
suits

The Co-Pilot dives towards Kyle and Carter whose scream
grows louder as they approach and lock hands so that
Carter and Edward are once again face to face

EDWARD
This is amazing

Carter’s too busy being terrified to respond

CO-PILOT
Cords in five seconds

He and Kyle separate getting distance between them

KYLE
You wanna do it

CARTER
No

KYLE

Just let ‘er rip

Carter is unsure which cord is which so he pulls
everything He’s jerked to a stop as both main and
emergency chutes billow open

Edward and the Co-Pilot continue to drop watching their
counterparts’ dueling chutes flapping high above

EDWARD
Amazing Nine toes in the grave he’s
still afraid to let go

CO-PILOT
Okay let’s deploy

EDWARD
Right there’s the piss of it When you’re
living for someone else you can’t help
but be careful No progress in careful

A whistle sounds and Edward joins the other contestants
behind a dozen long tables laid out end to end Before
each contestant is a tray of dozens of hot dogs in buns

Edward looks over at the tiny FEMALE KOREAN CONTESTANT

standing next to him Tries to stare her down
Carter and Thomas watch from the crowd

CARTER (CONT’D)

The heavily inked TATTOO ARTIST looks up at them from
behind the counter

EDWARD (CONTD)
Not literally

CARTER
Nah I think I’m gonna--

EDWARD
You can’t keep passing on things We’re
supposed to be in this together

CARTER
Tattoos and hot dogs aren’t exactly what
I had in mind

EDWARD
So what did you have in mind Something
metaphorical Something life-changing
Oooh Ahhh Lighten up already This
is supposed to be fun

CARTER
Fun is fine I have no problem with fun
I just imagined there’d be more behind
this than pretending we’re nine year-
old’s again

EDWARD
Nine year old’s don’t have tattoos

CARTER
That’s a wonderful argument

(to the Tattoo Artist)
Am I right

Carter pulls on his helmet Adjusts the microphone in
front of his mouth

CARTER
You sure we’re cleared for this

The Lamborghini comes to life whining like an aircraft
engine

EDWARD
It’s taken care of Why you want to pass
again

Carter turns the ignition on the Mustang It’s growl is
guttural and primal

CARTER
You’re in my world now See you at
dinner

EXT RACE TRACK - DAY

As the Mustang drenches the Lamborghini in a shower of
dirt and rocks as it fishtails out onto the track

INT LAMBORGHINI - DAY

Windshield wipers clear the dirt as Edward struggles to
put the car in gear

EDWARD
So it’s like that is it

The gears grind as he works the stick Finally gets the
car in gear as Carter is heard over the headset cackling
for joy

ON THE TRACK where the Mustang screams around a turn
taking a line close to the infield where the Lamborghini
hiccups in fits and starts towards the track

IN THE LAMBORGHINI Edward wrestles with the stick

EDWARD (CONTD)
Come on you stupid--

The car jerks forwards onto the tarmac right in the path
of the oncoming

IN THE MUSTANG Carter hits the gas taking the car low
across the infield narrowly missing the Lamborghini
before he roars back onto the track

Carter grins into his rearview mirror sees Edward’s car
swerving across the track behind him

IN THE LAMBORGHINI Edwards trying to control the car
CARTER (0S)
It’s a racing set up Steer with the
throttle

EDWARD
Which one’s the throttle

He’s about to hit the wall until he mashes the gas and
the car suddenly launches down the track

DOWN THE TRACK Edward pulls even with the Mustang

EDWARD (CONT’D)
So we’re having fun now

CARTER
It’s a nod in the right direction

The Mustang jumps ahead cuts the Lamborghini off

EDWARD
You know what your problem is

CARTER
I’m sure youll enlighten me

The Lamborghini cuts around and pulls even again

EDWARD
You’re the guy behind the chairs at the
poker table

CARTER
Come again

EDWARD
You know the one who stands there with
his hands in his pockets peering over
the players’ shoulders studying the game
like he’s learning something when all he
really wants to do is walk away

CARTER
And live to fight another day Maybe he’s
got a mortgage and tuition payments and-

EDWARD
So why’s he in the casino in the first
place He’s dying to get in the game
What’s keeping his hands in his pockets

CARTER
Not everyone can afford to play

EDWARD
I’m not talking about money I don’t
think he’s afraid to lose everybody
loses sometimes But what I think I
think that deep down you’re afraid to
win

Now the Lamborghini takes the lead clipping the front of
the Mustang as it pulls in front

CARTER
Jesus
(regains control of the car)
Why on earth would anybody be afraid to
win

EDWARD
That’s between you and your shrink I
just call ‘em where they fall

CARTER
You want to talk about-- You’re the most
fearful person I’ve ever known God
forbid you ever open the door a crack and
give up even the smallest ounce of
control

EDWARD
My work done my way Personal selfish
egotistical motivation Look where it’s
gotten me

CARTER
Alone bitter and scared of anything with
a hint of emotional consequence

EDWARD
Depravity’s in the eye of the beholder
At least I’m not chicken

IN THE MUSTANG Carter rolls his eyes knowing he
shouldn’t take the bait He drives evenly for a moment
Then despite himself

CARTER
Ah screw it

ON THE TRACK the Mustang revs and roars alongside of the
Lamborghini before slamming into its side The Mustang
pulls away then smashes into the car again

Both cars careen off the track punching through a chain
link fence then out into the outer parking lot

LONG SHOT as the two cars play demolition derby in the

empty lot colliding towards us until they roar past and
slam through the striped security gates and out onto the
open road

EXT RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

The cars speed down either side of the double-yellow line
doing well over a hundred as they smash back and forth

EDWARD
Do you have any idea what these cars cost
me

CARTER

We’re sitting at the table aren’t we

SIRENS BLARE as a police car appears behind them

CARTER (CONT’D)
Oh Jesus

EDWARD

CARTER
Are we really what

As the Lamborghini suddenly guns ahead red-lining down
the highway

CARTER (CONTD)
He really is crazy

The Mustang roars after it The police car loses ground
quickly

across the opposite seat watching the Yankee game

CARTER

EDWARD

I’ve got six innings left

CARTER
Suit yourself ‘Night Thomas

Thomas waves from the front as Carter climbs out and
closes the door behind him

THOMAS

EDWARD

Despite his sarcasm he watches Carter talking to the
street kids before climbing the steps to his door

EDWARD (CONTD)

INT EDWARD’S LIBRARY - NIGHT
Floor to ceiling bookshelves Edward slouches in a large

leather couch Heaves a sigh of displeasure as he
switches off the losing ballgame

He stands and stretches while looking around the room
Unsure of what to do he stuffs his hands in his pockets
and moves to a wall of books browsing the titles

EDWARD
Oh who cares

INT EDWARD’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Immense and unused with glowing hardwood floors and a
pristine grand piano covered in empty silver picture
frames He walks in like a stranger hands still in his
pockets and stops just inside the door

He stares for a long moment then turns and walks out

Lays an enormous platter of mashed potatoes into Edward’s
arms The rest of the family doesn’t move

CARTER (CONTD)
Well come on Turkey ain’t gonna carve

The family shuffles out reluctantly The boys bid Edward
hello but Virginia says nothing Clearly she’s been out-
voted

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Paneled walls wrapping around an immense mahogany table
Roger and Lee stare open-mouthed at the opulence

EDWARD
Okay just let me get a tablecloth or
something

Balances the potatoes as he rummages through some drawers
he’s probably never opened before

ROGER
How many people live here

Edward digs up a load of silverware and woven placemats
EDWARD
Just me And don’t touch anything This

stuff costs more than your education

LEE
We went to public school

EDWARD
Oh

The boys are too polite to laugh
EDWARD (CONTD)
You know what screw it Just dump it all
down there
Drops the potatoes with no small amount of relief
EDWARD (CONTD)
I don’t know about you guys but I could
eat a station wagon

The boys smile openly

CUT TO

A HI-TECH RECORD PLAYER as Edward lays a platter down on
the turntable and drops the needle Louis Armstrongs
Autumn in New York plays over the following SERIES

-- IN THE DINING ROOM Rachel organizes the place
settings Fork and spoon on the left knife on the right
Opposite her Edward tries to mirror the layout Gets it
right the second time

-- Carter sits with eyes closed and hands pressed
together saying grace Edward watches him eyes flicking
around the table to see the rest of the family have their
eyes closed

-- JUMP CUTS as Carter hands Edward the carving knife
Edward attacks the meat while the others look on
Virginia watches as her perfect roast is hacked to
pieces a blockish chunk lands on Lee’s plate

-- Edward is a wallflower as the family tucks into the
meal passing steaming dishes back and forth through a
lively discussion

-- Edward’s on his second plate He’s talking now
telling a story that has Virginia mildly on edge The
kids seem to love it except Rachel who makes eyes at
him Edward returns the look until she points to her
closed mouth He gets the picture and snaps his mouth
shut swallowing his food before continuing

-- Carter stares glumly at the tiny slice of apple pie
sitting on his plate Virginia is marking the size of
Edward’s slice with a pie cutter Edward motions for a
bigger piece Virginia moves the cutter Edward’s still
not satisfied She moves it again

-- IN THE KITCHEN Edward coaxes a steaming cup of coffee
from the copper siphon He puts it on a saucer and
carefully offers it to Virginia who has a chain-gang of
dishes going at the sink with Carter and the boys She
allows a thin smile as she moves to accept the coffee
then notices Carter behind Edward shaking his head not
to take it She looks back at Edward and politely demurs

-- IN THE LIBRARY Edward waits for the last bars of the
song to end before lifting the needle and carefully
sliding the record back into it’s sleeve

VIRGINIA (0S)
They played that at our wedding

She stands in the doorway wiping her hands on a kitchen
towel

EDWARD
You were married in the city

VIRGINIA
First Baptist in the Bronx My uncle was
the pastor so we got the reception room
for free It’s gone now ‘Put up one of
them gargantuan shopping malls

EDWARD
They tend to do that these days

VIRGINIA
They do

A beat He’s unsure how to approach her

EDWARD
Health care’s a perilous industry The
only way we can keep the hospitals from
closing is to reduce the overhead so--

VIRGINIA
I understand It’s business

EDWARD
Not to the people we let go

VIRGINIA
Do you find that difficult

EDWARD
Only when you meet them Which I try very
hard not to do

VIRGINIA
I don’t blame you

EDWARD
We keep them from closing

VIRGINIA
You don’t owe me anything

EDWARD
Still I’d like to--

VIRGINIA
Give him back to me

EDWARD
I’m not sure I can--

VIRGINIA
I’m not asking for his sake He’s the
only one who can decide what’s best for
him I’m asking for myself

EDWARD
I don’t understand

VIRGINIA
I’m prepared for him to die If there’s
one thing I understand it’s that but
what I can’t do-- I’m his wife I’m not
prepared to lose him while he’s alive

Her eyes hold his She’s laid herself wide open and he’s
unable to look away

me but you’ve got your family to think
about and--

CARTER
‘Ginia got to you didn’t she

EDWARD
She wants you back You can’t blame her
for--

CARTER

Why do you think I’m doing this

EDWARD
Because I talked you into it

CARTER
(shakes his head a beat)

At first you tell yourself it’s a rut
just part of the ups and downs of
marriage You figure the pendulum will
swing back the other way like it always
has before and everything will be right
again A year goes by then another and
soon you’ve been sleeping only on your
side of the bed so long you forget how to
reach across and bring her into your
arms You forget why you could never walk
down the sidewalk without holding her
hand or what it was about her smile that
stirred you She’s the same girl I fell
in love with at seventeen Nothing’s
changed but everything’s different Then
I realized it’s me

(MORE)

CARTER (CONTD)
I lost something along the way and I aim
to find it Sometimes you have to take
the long way home

Edward nods slowly

CARTER (CONT’D)
Tell me about the island

EDWARD

beach surveying the reef and gently lapping waves

EDWARD

They sit in the sand Carter scoops up a handful and lets
it run through his open fingers He sighs contentedly
Edward sighs as well Several long empty moments pass

Carter sighs again Edward nods in silent agreement
Several more moments pass until

CARTER
Think we can still call the plane back

EDWARD
God I hope so

Whips out his satellite phone as they run back towards
the trees brushing the wet sand off their butts

tasks

discussion

Edward sits at the far end chatting with PRINCE WILLIAM
He shares a look with Carter who is unable to organize
himself until a mechanical voice interrupts--

CARTER
The ancient Egyptians had a beautiful
belief about death When their souls
reached the entrance to heaven the gods
would ask them two questions Their
answers determined if they were admitted
or not

EDWARD
What were they

CARTER
Have you found joy in your life

Edward realizes that Carter has opened his eyes and is
looking directly at him

EDWARD
What you’re asking Oh how the hell do
T--

CARTER

It’s a simple question Have you found
joy in your life

EDWARD
(thinks for several moments)
Yes
CARTER
When
EDWARD

Next question
Edward’s uncomfortable with whatever he remembered

CARTER
Has your life brought joy to others

EDWARD
(standing)
This is horseshit

CARTER
Is it

Haven’t I done enough for you
(getting agitated)
I set everything up myself Paid for the

I’m more grateful than you’1l ever know
I didn’t know you before but now you’re
my friend and if I had the means there’s
nothing I wouldn’t do for you if asked

EDWARD
Thank you

The question still stands

Edward walks several paces away hands in his pockets
Several moments pass

She was born on a Sunday I remember
because there wasn’t a single cloud in
the sky and I thought it was somehow
appropriate I know cheesy right
(Carter just listens this is

I managed to push her out of my mind the
last few years but after meeting your
daughter-- And sometimes when I wake up
in the morning

He sits down next to Carter Takes an angry breath

EDWARD (CONT’D)
Carl Okafor was an activist Emily had
joined some “save the poor people” thing
and I guess they met and she decided she
loved him I saw him a few times Good
looking kid Smart Driven But there was
something about him I didn’t Anyway
when she said they were engaged I told
her I was against it But being my
daughter she went ahead anyway We had
some distance for a while she’s as
stubborn as her old man but she seemed
happy The first time he hit her she
came to me I wanted to-- I wanted to
beat him into the dirt until he begged
for forgivenessbut she wouldn’t let
me She said it wasn’t his fault He was
broke Had a few drinks Said she picked
the fight I gave her some money and
she went back to him When the money ran
out he did it again She didn’t come to
me that time

CARTER
What did you do

EDWARD
I did what any father would do I got him
a job Administration in a small hospital
in Great Neck Gave him an office and a
salary Company car

CARTER
I don’t understand

EDWARD
I let him get comfortable Let him think
he’d got it made until one night when he
was out banging one of the nurses I had
someone crack his computer and move a
bunch of money around The next morning
he showed up for work and they arrested
him on the spot My lawyer’s a pitbull
Got him ten years for embezzlement

CARTER
And Emily

EDWARD
She saw through me like glass Cursed me
out in front of the entire courtroom
after his sentencing Called me names you
wouldn’t believe Said I was dead to her
(MORE)

EDWARD (CONTD)
But I figure if that’s what it took I
grew up with nothing I’m not proud of
everything I’ve done but I’ve played by
the rules for the most part If my
daughter hates me and they don’t let me
into heavenwell then I guess that’s
just life isn’t it

CARTER
Happy endings are for suckers

EDWARD
Yeah

They stare at the desert for a beat Then Carter stands

This is a gift that you’ve given me and
everything I’ve seen and done has been

CARTER
Because they’re monuments That’s what

EDWARD
Yeah but does being dead have to be a
prerequisite We can’t put up a tomb to
the unborn soldier “He would have died

been Catholic”

worked Sixty years and they’re still
finding wreckage up there

EDWARD

CARTER
Two years on the hump Not a scratch on
him

EDWARD
Lucky guy

the Jap zeros which could ambush you from
anywhere as you flew through the valleys

CARTER
Maybe When the storms rolled in and he
couldn’t see an inch past the windshield
he used to close his eyes and focus until
he couldn’t hear the copilot or even the
engines He’d focus until everything fell
away except the mountains passing on
either side He could hear them and ‘til
the day he passed he swore they could
hear him in return

What did they sound like

I asked him once Near as he could figure-
“Voice of god” he said

I could be dead in a week

CARTER
You just--

EDWARD
How do I tell herwithout her believing
that I’m only reaching out because I’m
scared to die alone and didn’t care
enough to consider what that would put
her through

youre flying around the world to “find

EDWARD
That you blame her for your lack of
accomplishment

CARTER
Don’t you dare--

EDWARD
That you say things like you “wouldn’t
trade your life with them for anything”
but deep down you question yourself so
you say those things because you know
they’re the right thing to say rather
than what you really feel

CARTER
You have no idea what I feel

EDWARD
Maybe I don’tbut I know this I love
my daughter If I didn’t I would be back
there knocking on her door If you loved

thinking “What’s a girl looks like this

I’ve never been worthy of you

VIRGINIA
I was joking baby I knew that night

Virginia’s grip on Edward’s arm grows tighter and tighter
until he winces

VIRGINIA
Oh Sorry

EDWARD
It’s in the bag

His grin begins to subside as he watches Carter wipe a
think band of sweat from his forehead

CARTERS POV is blurred as his hand slips on the pen He
closes his eyes to steady himself but his vision is
blurred even further

VIRGINIA
Edward

EDWARD

He starts circling the stage crossing behind the cameras
to get closer to the contestants

Carter scribbles loosely on the screen but drops the pen
and falls just as Edward gets there to catch him

heavily marked with surgery markers

sealed envelope and a folded slip of paper

CARTER (CONT’D)
Got any of that coffee left

EDWARD
I’m all out I can see if there’s
anywhere that sells it out here but--

CARTER
(smiles )
Not if I was dying of thirst in the
desert Wanna know why

EDWARD
“Im sure you’ll enlighten me”

Carter hands the paper to Edward

CARTER
Read

EDWARD

(reading)
Kopi Luwak is the world’s most expensive
coffee though for some it falls under
the category of too good to be true In
the village where the beans are grown
lives a breed of wild African tree-cats
The cats eat the beans digest them
then

(a beat he swallows)
--then defecate them out for the
villagers to collect It’s the gastric
juices of the cat that give the coffee
its unique flavor and absence of
aftertaste You’re shitting me

CARTER
Cats beat me to it

He bursts into weak laughter Edward stares for a moment
then starts to chuckle himself Soon both men are
laughing until tears stream down their cheeks As he
laughs Edward’s tears become gradually laced with grief
as he hold’s Carter’s wrist

CARTER (CONTD)
Still have the list

EDWARD
Of course
(pulls it out along with the
red pen)
There’s only a few left Which one do you
want to do next

Carter runs a finger down the items until he reaches
“LAUGH UNTIL I CRY” He crosses it off shakily with the
pen Only four remain

His finger stops on the half finished “11) GET BACK IN
TOUCH” Edward sees this

CARTER
There’s a difference between dying alone
and living like you’re already dead
Finish the list Edward
He places the envelope atop the list

CARTER (CONT’D)
Go home

CUT TO

Carter reaches out for Virginia’s hand and presses it to
his heart

VIRGINIA

CARTER
Forever’s just getting started

Her hand slips out of his as he’s wheeled out of the
room

INT GULFSTREAM PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

Edward loses himself in the raindrops sliding down the
window as the plane readies for takeoff

He glances down at the envelope in his lap and turns it
over On the front is his name and address He thinks a
moment steeling himself before he opens it

INT OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT

Carter lies unconscious with a tube in his mouth as the
surgeons do their work In contrast to Edward he looks
completely at peace

CARTER (VO)
Dear Edward It’s turning cold out here
in Newark and the trees are like
skeletons beneath the lamp posts
Winter’s almost upon us and despite what
the doctors tell me I know it will be my
last

EXT THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT

Seen from the Hudson the mandala of lights reflect like
jewels in the water Carter sits on the edge of a pier
taking in the view

CARTER (VO)
You know how I love to tell stories so if
you can spare a few minutes I think I’ve
got a good one for you

He returns to the letter in his lap and resumes
writing

CARTER (VO) (CONTD)
There was an old farmer spent his life
working the earth to give his family all
the cares and comforts he’d never had

INT GULFSTREAM PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

Edward reads the words as Carter speaks them

CARTER (VO)
One day the farmer fell sick and he
called his sons to his bedside where he
took up a bundle of sticks and said to
his eldest son Show me that you can
break it” The son strained and strained
but with all his efforts was unable to
break the bundle

Edward finishes the letter and wipes the tears from his
cheeks The flashing wing lights of the plane reflect the
raindrop on the window indelibly onto his face

INT LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Seen from above as Roger Lee and Rachel lie in bed with
their mother clinging to her as she prays

CARTER (VO)
The other sons also tried but none of
them could break it Untie the bundle
said the farmer And each of you take a
stick

EXT SUBURB STREET - DAWN

As Edward walks up the path to his daughter’s house He
knocks on the door without hesitation

CARTER (VO)
When they had done so he called out to
them Now break them and each stick
was easily broken

The door opens revealing Emily She’s surprised and her
sleepy features harden instantly Edward begins to talk

CARTER (VO) (CONTD)
No man is an island my friend We’re
just not built that way

INT LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Virginia scoops instant coffee into a styrofoam cup She
looks up as Holcomb appears at the other end of the
hallway walking towards her His face is unreadable

CARTER (VO)
You measure yourself by the people who
measure themselves by you and no matter
how you battle the current--

EXT EMILY’S HOUSE - DAWN

Thomas leans against the limo watching through the
window as Carter and Emily speak Her guard is still up
but she’s listening

CARTER (VO)
--our lives are streams flowing into the
same river towards whatever heaven lies
in the mist beyond the falls

INT LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL - NIGHT

We can’t see Holcomb’s face or what he’s saying as he
reaches Virginia but her expression says it all The
coffee cup slips from her hands and lands at her feet
spilling onto the floor

CARTER (VO)
Find the joy in your life Edward Close
your eyes and let the waters take you

INT EMILY’S HOUSE - DAWN

Edward shakes Emily’s hand goodbye She’s not giving in
but it’s a start He reaches for the front door just as a
LITTLE GIRL still half-asleep comes out from the back
bedroom Edward is stunned

CARTER (VO)
Open your heart and listen to the
mountain

He looks up at Emily who says something to the little
girl He crouches down as the girl walks right up to him
and lays her head on his shoulder His eyes are full as
he looks up at Emily in amazement then slowly kisses his
granddaughter’s head

INT LOS ANGELES OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT
Carter’s face is at peace Virginia’s face comes into
frame and kisses him softly Her tears fall onto his

eyelids and continue down his cheeks

CARTER (VO)
I promise youll be heard

INT LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Virginia stands in the doorway staring at her sleeping
children Rachel opens her eyes and looks at her mother

EXT EMILY’S HOUSE - DAWN

Edward walks the path towards Thomas and the waiting
limo

CARTER (VO)

We’re a bundle of sticks you and I be
it in this world or the one that follows
I will be forever grateful for the joy
your life has brought to mine

Thomas opens the car door for him

THOMAS
So that’s your daughter
EDWARD
(emotional)
Yup
THOMAS

Edward looks angry Thomas waits for the rebuke Instead
Edward pats him on the shoulder before climbing into the
car Thomas looks back at the house as the lights go out

INT LIMOUSINE - DAWN

Edward pulls the list out of his pocket With the red pen
he crosses out “KISS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE
WORLD”

CARTER (VO)
Your friend always Carter

Edward lowers the window and looks out at the painted
dawn sky as the limo drives away He stares for several
moments then closes his eyes and listens

EDWARD (VO)

Good afternoon My name is Edward Cole

and I’m not much of a storyteller

CUT TO
INT LARGE ROOM - DAY
Edward is in his business suit again His game face on
EDWARD
I’m a business man a good one I run

hospitals
(MORE)

EDWARD (CONTD)
We take sick people and make them well
again Sometimes we succeed and sometimes
we fail but we’re getting better at it
every day I started out with nothing
but cold ambition and over the years my
company grew until I had everything I
ever wanted I know now that-- I know
now that I was never a wealthy man until
my best friend came into my lifeand
from this incredible turnout it only
verifies the fact that Carter was truly
the richest man I know

CAMERA TRACKS until we’re behind Edward revealing his
audience of nearly a THOUSAND MOURNERS filling every last
inch of the room including Carter’s family who sit in the
front row Familiar faces in the crowd include Manny
Holcomb Nurse Shing parents and players of the soccer
team etc

EDWARD (CONTD)
I don’t know what most people say at
these things so I’1l just tell you what
I think Carter would want you to know
He’s dead and I still can’t shut him
up He loved his children more than his
own heart He loved his wife more than
his own soul He took the long way home
but he made it back and you took him in
and made him whole again and you will
never know how grateful he was

His eyes move from the family to Thomas who stands
against the wall with Emily and her daughter

EDWARD (CONTD)
(taking out the Bucket List)
We saw the world together Pretty amazing
when you think that only nine months ago
we were strangers He saved my life
and he knew it before I did

With the pen he crosses out “HELP A COMPLETE STRANGER
FOR THE GOOD”

Beneath it the last remaining task lies unfulfilled
“LISTEN TO THE MOUNTAIN AND BE HEARD” Slowly the words
on the page--

DISSOLVE TO

EXT THE PEAK OF EVEREST - DAY

As the climber from the opening scene finally arrives at
the peak

EDWARD (VO)
Carter gave me a book once It was about
a man who knew a thing or two about the
world

The climber walks over to a flat stone and lifts it onto
its side He removes his gloves revealing a wedding ring
on his left hand

EDWARD (VO) (CONT’D)
The man said “Learn as if you were going
to live forever Live as if you were
going to die tomorrow”

His hands lift to his face removing the oxygen mask and
hood revealing THOMAS

He reaches down and lifts A FROZEN CHOCK FULL 0’ NUTS CAN
from its resting place in the hole beneath the rock He
wipes off a section of frost with his thumb revealing

A PHOTOGRAPH taped to the can -- Carter and Virginia at
their second wedding surrounded by their family

Thomas sets the can on the snow then opens his backpack
and reaches down to the bottom--

EDWARD (VO) (CONT’D)
Tomorrow comes for all of us

--and removes A SECOND CHOCK FULL O’ NUTS CAN which he
places on the ground next to the first

EDWARD (VO) (CONT’D)
It’s what we do in-between that makes us
who we are

CLOSE ON A NEWER PHOTOGRAPH taped to the second coffee
can It’s Edward He’s old and grey

CARTER (VO)
Edward Perriman Cole died in May It was
a Sunday in the afternoon and there
wasn’t a cloud in the sky

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that he’s closely surrounded
by Thomas Emily and their THREE CHILDREN hands
intertwined with--

--Carter’s grandchildren each of whom stands with their
parents and Virginia One family

Edward is smiling like we’ve never seen

CARTER (V0O) (CONTD)
He was seventy-nine years old

Finally Thomas deposits both cans into the hole beneath
the rock

CARTER (VO) (CONT’D)
Even now I can’t claim to understand the
measure of a life but I can tell you
this

Thomas replaces the rock over the coffee cans

CARTER (CONTD)
I know that when he died his eyes were
closed and his heart was open I know
that he could hear the mountain

THE CAMERA lingers on the rock for a moment then tilts up
to reveal the breathtaking view of the entire world
below

CARTER (VO) (CONTD)
And I know the mountain heard him in
return

THE END
