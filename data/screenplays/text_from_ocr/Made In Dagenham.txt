EXT ESTATE IN DAGENHAM —- DAY

RITA O’GRADY and her husband EDDIE both late twenties
step onto the balcony of a flat on a massive housing
estate in East London With them are their two children
GRAHAM and SHARON

They kiss the kids goodbye as another man also in blue
overalls emerges from the flats clambers onto a bike
and sets off down the car-less streets Rita and Eddie
grab their own bikes and ride off into an ever
broadening stream of people

EXT ESTATE - DAY

On another part of the estate a much younger woman
SANDRA emerges from a flat waves to her mum on a
balcony above and hops onto her bike She wobbles off
the white patent leather boots she is wearing make
balance something of a challenge

INT ESTATE - DAY

Sandra filters in with the great tide of cyclists pouring
from the Estate beneath the baking sun We see them from
high above Sandra spots Eddie and Rita calls out and
speeds up to join them

INT FORD MAIN PLANT - DAY

The tide has become a flood as more and more cyclists
freewheel through town and down a hill towards a massive
industrial complex with a blue neon sign above it FORD
MOTORS

As they approach the factory the cyclists diverge men
one way women the other Several people stop and kiss at
the point of divergence including Eddie and Rita Then
he pushes off towards the Main Plant brand new and state
of the art while she turns her bike towards a crumbling
nineteen twenties monolith the River Plant We follow
Rita as she cycles between the blackened paint peeled
buildings to a series of bike racks There along with
Sandra Eileen Brenda and Monica she dismounts and
glancing at the hot sun passes into the factory MUSIC

INT RIVER PLANT — DAY

On the shop floor a cramped filthy windowless place
chatter and laughter rings out The girls nearly 200 of
them roll down their overalls and tie the arms off in
front of them revealing bras or camisoles And as Rita
enters and moves to her bench we drop to floor level and
see that nearly all of the women have now removed their
shoes As Rita threading up her sewing machine wipes a
bead of sweat away from her face we understand why the
place is an oven Rita grabs a box of vinyl pieces as
Eileen walks past revealing a ferocious wired bra

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS
100809 ORANGE REVISIONS 2

RITA

Bloody hell Eileen you got more support
there than the Arsenal-

Eileen makes
of a hooter

to retort but is interrupted by a the sound
Almost at once there is the noise of a

generator engaging and then a staggering cacophony as 200
sewing machines start to clatter away Talk impossible
the women get down to work

Rita pulls several pieces from the box beside her and
picks up a car headrest frame She arranges the vinyl
around the frame and starts to machine it into place It
is hugely intricate but nevertheless she sews at
breathtaking speed and quickly completes the first item
She places it on a trolley behind her and grabs the next

frame

EXT DAGENHAM HIGH STREET - DAY

Silence The

street is utterly deserted And we see how

bare how basic how unlike the Swinging Sixties is
Dagenham And then we see a lone figure CONNIE late
forties cycling towards the plant as fast as she can

INT RIVER PLANT — DAY

Rita curses

One of her nails is chipped She wipes sweat

away again and resumes her work at a ferocious speed
finishing another headrest As she reaches for the next
frame Connie enters flustered-

CONNIE

Sorry Im late-

RITA
(smiles shouts)

Everything alright

Connie looks

across from threading her machine

CONNIE

Yeah Just overslept

Connie takes
water on the
her machine
above with a

off her shoes places a washing up bowl of
floor and stands in it Then she turns to
hassled But suddenly something drops from
thud Connie jumps startled It is a dead

bird entangled in cotton threads Already there’s
laughter from those who saw the near miss Connie tenses
staring at the animal on her work bench with a steely
expression She’s not in the mood Instantly more

laughter

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS
100809 ORANGE REVISIONS 3

BRENDA
Least it didn’t shit on you They do that
sometimes ‘Fore they die

Connie picks up the bird and marches to the bin with it
Rita looks to the rafters where hundreds of other birds

hang dead

laugh as

She then turns back to Connie trying not to
she arrives at her place But immediately the

hooter sounds again and the power to the machines is
switched off The girls start to make themselves decent-

ALBERT
LadiesIf I could just interrupt you a
second-

Rita looks to the far doorway There a man in his late
fifties in blue overalls waits staring at the floor

in a well

The girls

practised manoeuvre This is ALBERT FINCHAM

RITA
Stand by your beds men

laugh but all around there is also a hubbub of

excited chatter as they complete getting dressed Connie
however hurries down the aisles and shunts the girls

forward

The noise

her

CONNIE

and walks to the front Connie moves across and

Albert’s side facing the girls He leans into

ALBERT

Albert climbs onto a bench and the noise rises
accordingly Voices are calling out “What’s happening
then What they decided” Albert struggles to speak over

the top

ALBERT (CONTD)
Yeah AlrightHang on I’1lIf you’d

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS
100809 ORANGE REVISIONS 4

A shout that he’s lovely when he’s cross Albert sags but
gradually the girls are quiet He nods relieved

ALBERT (CONTD)

SoThe deadline we set the management
to respond to our complaint about how

time)

Rita nervously)

A stunned moment then as Albert steps down a huge cheer
and applause as and the women break into groups talking
excitedly Eileen grabs Rita

EILEEN

Rita looks nervous too

RITA
First time for everything

BRENDA
Fuck ‘em That’s what I say Every other

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS
100809 ORANGE REVISIONS 5

Everyone laughs and the girls return to their benches
still chattering furiously In the doorway Albert
watches the women going back to their positions A young
lad BRIAN passes by sweeping the corridor Albert
looks to him indicating the girls

ALBERT
I fought Rommel you know I was never
once scared like I am when I go in there

The hooter sounds and the machines start up again
Immediately the door slides shut just as the girls begin
to disrobe

INT DAGENHAM DOCK CLUB - EVENING

The sports and social club has been decorated with
streamers and balloons Young Girl by Gary Puckett plays
on a large portable record player perched on the stage
at one end of the room However the dark suits and knee
length skirts of the packed dance floor bring to mind the
nineteen fifties not the sixties

The joint is jumping nevertheless And standing at a
corner table Rita throws down a large gin before rushing
back to Eddie caught in the thick of the dancing Close
to him is Connie with GEORGE her husband a couple of
years younger angular and handsome moving stiffly Also
nearby are Eileen and Dave Eddie spins Rita rather too
vigorously and she nearly goes over laughing as he
grabs her again Then suddenly the music stops and
everyone is plunged into near darkness Moans and
complaints from the floor as a Dave runs towards the
record player

DAVE
Alright Hold your horses-

EILEEN
(to Dave)
This happens every time-

More shouts of derision
CONNIE
He puts the wrong fuse in I keep tellin’

him-

Then suddenly a piano sounds out Heads spin towards the
back of the room where the older folk are gathered

RITA
Oh God Give him half a chance and he’s
in there-

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS 6

Albert is playing “MY OLD MAN” The oldsters immediately
start singing along to groans from the youngsters

RITA (CONTD)
-Bleedin’ Liberace-

But then the power is back on and Rita puts the record
player on again drowning out Albert It’s Sandie Shaws
Always Something There To Remind Me A big cheer Rita
and the others start dancing She looks across to a
peeved Albert and winks at him He’s not amused Eddie
leans in-

EDDIE
Here where’s Brenda gone

Rita looks uneasy She shrugs Eddie nods and whisks her
off again

INT CAR - EVENING

A man grunts and thrusts He’s having sex eyes shut
across the back seat of his motor Beneath him Brenda
stares at a tear along the seam of the front passenger
seat The man opens his eyes and finally stops thrusting
At last Brenda looks at him

BRENDA

Your trim That’1ll be hangin’ right off
in a day or two that will

(points to tear on seam)
And I bet I know the girl what sowed it
n’all

(nods smugly He is stunned)
Go on then Chop chop Or we’ll miss the
buffet

He hesitates then goes for it anyway Brenda head
rocking looks back to the edge of the seat typical

something very sixties and very unstable Rita watches
her then looks back to George uneasily He starts to

move but it’s an effort-—

ALBERT (VO)

They turn Albert is staring across at Sandra he bends
to one side limbering up Rita smiles at Alberts
gesture He turns to Connie

ALBERT (CONTD)

RITA

Rita smiles

EXT DOCK CLUB - NIGHT

drag on a fag finishes ironing a shirt and moves across
to a cooker where she removes a pan of beans from the

across it Rita is shocked

load brand new shining Ford cars onto transporters But

INT FACTORY FLOOR - DAY 15

The thunder of the factory The women work in silence
Sweat drips from Rita’s face and she wipes her brow with
her sleeve She’s moving with her usual speed but with
something else too aggression as she yanks hard at the
cotton threads she must cut off from around the
headrests Then there is a moan She turns Connie has
stopped work and glugs from a bottle of Lucozade

CONNIE
Never again I swear

Beside Connie Eileen re-applies a cold flannel to the
back of her neck and Brenda downs a pint of milk But
suddenly spots of water are dripping through the roof

CONNIE (CONT’D)
Oh-

She looks up and grabs an umbrella which she wedges above
her station

BRENDA
Alley-bloody-lujah-

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS

trolley is wheeled behind her She inspects it

RITA
ConConnie

(indicates a tear)
Youre gonna have to say somethin’-

Sandra who blows bubble gum sees Rita looking and

ALBERT
Oh Christ

He looks down averting his gaze Rita grinning calls
out

All hands go up in the air Several people call out too
Albert looks over the rows of faces just as stymied as
before But then he notices Rita Their gazes lock again
And he smiles

EXT RIVER PLANT — DAY 16

Rita wipes down her bench and tosses the off cuttings and
threads in a bin The women are done for the day She
hurries towards the exit But her way is suddenly
blocked as a forklift truck tows in a massive trailer
load of dismantled un-upholstered seats

CONNIE
What you doin’ with them

GORDON
This new Escort Looks like they finally
designed something people like

The driver jumps down unhooking the load

BRENDA
Well they can get fucked We’ve had our
vote We ain’t doin’ no overtime

GORDON
Yeah you took the plunge at last

He doesn’t re-connect the trailer but climbs on board the
forklift anyway scoffing

GORDON (CONTD)
Me and the boys was sayin’ we’d’ve gone
on strike years ago just havin’ to turn
up in a pig hole like this You know it’s
rainin’ in here don’t you
And he drives off The women stare at the seats suddenly
aware of what they are doing Rita frustrated by the
delay leans in to Connie

RITA
I’1l see you tomorrow-

CONNIE
Rita-

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS 14

RITA (0S)

And she has Connie hesitates Then she looks to the
girls and walks out They follow her Soon all that
remains are the seats un-touched

INT WOMENS LOCKER ROOM- DAY 17

Rita is down to her underwear already in high heels She
slides a pencil skirt on toppling against the cubicle
wall-

RITA
Christ-

Then she grabs a top-

Then she pulls on a top runs in front of a mirror
checks her teeth and is off-

EXT STREET - DAY 18

It’s stopped raining as Rita slides through a puddle on
her bike and stops She jumps off and leans it against a
brick wall She straightens her blouse and immediately
curses one stocking is smeared with splashed up dirt
She considers her options then glancing round removes
it Then the other one Then she hurries round a corner
and approaches the Thomas A Becket Grammar School It is
much leafier here and cars can be seen for the very first
time most parked near the waiting mothers gathered at
the gate As Rita strides towards them short skirted
shapely legged several women turn to look at her Rita
stiffens slightly A bell rings and the school starts to
let out

INT CLASSROOM - DAY 19

A teacher fifties cleans a blackboard as Rita enters
the classroom

RITA
Mr Clarke
(he turns)
I wondered if I could have a word
He considers her

TEACHER
Of course-

He motions to a chair Rita hesitates it’s a pupil’s and
rather small She sits anyway He smiles

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS
100809 ORANGE REVISIONS 15

TEACHER (CONT’D)
How may I help you

His tone is clipped Empire Rita stares at the man
There is no easy way Finally-

RITA
You hit my son

He frowns confused But Rita hearing it said feels
stronger And more angry

RITA (CONTD)
On his hand You caned him And it ain’t
the first time

TEACHER
Ah Yes O’GradyI remember

He smiles not the slightest hint of remorse Rita is
wrong footed He crosses the room-

TEACHER (CONTD)
Forgot his protractor And it isn’t the
first time

He nonchalantly collects some books Rita flares-
RITA
I don’t care whether it’s the tenth time

I don’t want you doin’ it

She stops knows she’s lost her temper but she holds his
gaze nonetheless He simply smiles calmly

TEACHER
Have you spoken to your husband about
this Mrs O’Grady

RITA

(surprised)

WhatNoI-

TEACHER
I do find where matters of discipline are
concerned that’s usually the best route-

RITA
He’s my son

Again she flinches inwardly But again he seems calm

TEACHER
You live on the estate don’t you

Rita is confused but also on guard now-

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS 16

RITA
I don’t see what-

TEACHER
We find that those boys who come to us
from the estate often have difficulty in
adjusting to the standards of behaviour
required in a school like thisIt’s not
really their fault Their parents have
invariably never undergone the full
rigours of academic life-

He looks at her quizzically And now Rita struggles to
hold his gaze The teacher continues pleased

TEACHER (CONTD)
So the boys can hardly look to them for
guidance

Rita tries to keep her expression neutral

TEACHER (CONTD)
But they do adaptIn timeAnd I’m
sure your son will too If he’s just
given the chance

He smiles comes across and holds out his hand to shake
Rita stares at it utterly shocked

INT SCHOOL - DAY

Rita walks blindly away from the classroom turns down a
corridor and stops Ahead is a dead end She quickly
retraces her steps passing back round the corner
Another woman LISA waits outside the classroom now She
turns to face Rita She is of a similar age thin and
impeccably dressed in expensive high street fashion She
frowns sensing Rita’s distress

LISA
Are you alright

She speaks with a posh voice Rita trembles

RITA
Fuck off

Then Rita barges past her

ALBERT

room with no windows It is silent

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS 21

PETER HOPKINS Ford’s Head of Industrial Relations late
thirties sits beside two other menGRANT and JONES both
middle aged facing Monty Albert Rita and Connie Rita
glances at the clock Four fifteen A black suited
PENTHOUSE STEWARDESS serves tea and coffee no one says
thank you except Rita Finally-

GRANT
On a previous occasion in a free vote
the girls agreed to the new grading
structure-

ALBERT
They did not agree however as to where
they would end up on it Which is why
were sittin’ round this table

Silence again Rita fidgets

HOPKINS
Look I understand what the girls are
saying I just don’t think that they
appreciate-

MONTY
I’d rather you didn’t speak for the
girls Mr HopkinsNone of us here knows
what’s in their heads

That comment makes Rita look across She turns to Connie
Her eyes are firmly on her note pad still

HOPKINS

The fact remains there is a formal
grievance procedure already in place And
the machinists’ case will be heard What
we can’t do is let them jump the queue-

(Rita frowns)
-or every other Ford employee who is
waiting on a decision will want our
blood

MONTY
Peter LookYou know me I ain’t got no
axe to grind with Ford Am I right or am
I right

HOPKINS
You’ve always been very fair

MONTY
ExactlyAnd we’re all men of the world
so-

Rita looks to Albert This is getting too much

100809 ORANGE REVISIONS
100809 ORANGE REVISIONS 22

MONTY (CONTD)
-let’s cut to the chase shall we We’1l1
agree to re-convene in two weeks time-

Albert stiffens Rita looks appalled

ALBERT
Monty-

MONTY
Wait ListenWe’ll re-conveneand
well come back down here again for the
dayAnd at that point you’ll guarantee
to look into the girls’ complaint

ALBERT
The thing is Monty-

MONTY
That wayyou can go back to your bosses
and say the strike’s off ‘cause of how
you handled today’s negotiationsand we
can go back to the girls and say they’re
now your number one priorityIn a few
weeks time

Hopkins glances at the other Ford men counts to three

All heads
means it

HOPKINS
That seems very fair

ALBERT
Yeah well I’m not sure the girls-—

MONTY
The girls’1ll be fine So long as they
know they’re not just gettin’ fobbed off
by the management the unions’s settin’
the terms That’s what matters-

RITA (0S)

she realises She turns-

RITA (CONTD)

(to Monty)
“That’s what matters to the girls”

RITA (CONTD)
(looks to Connie who stares
back amazed)
What matters is this-

She reaches into her bag and throws a pile of vinyl
cuttings of the kind we saw her machine at the start in
front of Hopkins

RITA (CONTD)
There You put them together-
(spreads them out)
13 different bits That makes up an head
rest cover

GRANT
Ford property I believe-

RITA
Oh get stuffed-

(to Hopkins on track)
What matters is that we have to take them
13 different bits of material and imagine
how they fit together’cause there
ain’t no templateand then we have to
sew ‘em all free hand into the finished
article Same with seat covers and door
trim And that is not unskilled work
Which is how you’ve re-graded us Christ
you have to take an exam to get on our

line-
HOPKINS
Please Miss-
RITA
MrsO’Grady
HOPKINS
Mrs O’Grady I understand your grievance
But-
RITA

Oh no No no no noDon’t start with
all that again all that I appreciate I
sympathiseIt ain’t difficult we’re
entitled to semi-skilled And the wages
what go with it-

(Hopkins makes to speak)
Andas regards queue jumpin’ we put
this complaint in months ago-

(Albert is impressed)

-and you done nothin’ about it And we
both know why you done nothin’ n’all
don’t we ‘Cause we’re women and the
women have never gone on strike This is

Rita stands A moment The others stand too dazed The
meeting is clearly over

EXT FORD HEADQUARTERS WARLEY - AFTERNOON 28

Rita drags on a cigarette by Albert’s car an old Ford
Corsair She looks worried Connie is with her She looks
nervous too The reason is about twenty yards away by a
phone box Albert being railed at by Monty After a
moment Monty storms into the box and dials Albert walks
back

ALBERT
He’s calling Branch Tellin’ ‘em what you
said
RITA
(nods )

He seems a bit

She shrugs awkwardly They all look back to the phone
box Monty rants Then Albert fixes Rita with a stare and
points a spindly finger And he grins

ALBERT

I knewI knew Up there-

(taps head She frowns)
I wanted clever Rita That’s why I
picked you

(she is stunned)
Bringin’ them cuttin’s in thoughthat
was magnificentI didn’t expect that

RITA
Oh no No Grant was right I was

At the car he turns He looks Rita in the eye

ALBERT (CONT’D)
Leave Monty to me

Rita is wrong footed by Albert’s rapid re-focusing
Connie steps forward-

CONNIE
And what about the factory The girls
What you gonna say to them

ALBERT
I’m not gonna say anythin’ Con You’re
in charge on the shop floor They’re your
business

He smiles and ducks down into his car Connie turns to
Rita

CONNIE

fault
She crosses to the car too And we see she is hiding a
smile too She clambers into the car On Rita Worried
INT RIVER PLANT - AFTERNOON
The girls are all hard at work when the hooter sounds

EXT WESTMINSTER - DAY

Big Ben booms out and a new day dawns

INT BARBARA CASTLE’S WESTMINSTER OFFICES - DAY

Another pair of bare feet the stockinged soles of which

scratch an itch beneath a large desk Then we see a sign

on the desk SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT AND
PRODUCTIVITY and behind it the petite figure of a woman
with flame red hair pouring over a huge pile of manila
files

BARBARA CASTLE
Now I realise this is my first day in
the jobAnd it may be that I’m missing
something here-

She speaks in a thick Lancashire accent which has poshed
up over the years She looks up and stares at two clean
cut men in their twenties her undersecretaries who sit
opposite Then she stands and walks from behind her desk
She paces the room

BARBARA CASTLE (CONT’D)

But what I do know is that when we were
elected two years ago it was on a wave
of optimism that the Labour Party would
utilise it’s close relationship with the
Unions to develop manufacturing industry
to make it better serve the employer and
the employee

The man glance at each other uncertainly

UNDERSECRETARY
I think that was part of the manifesto-

BARBARA CASTLE
It was trust me

Her tone is entirely rhetorical She stares at the men
Then she looks even more censorious-

BARBARA CASTLE (CONT’D)
So what exactly have you been doing
Since nineteen sixty six

UNDERSECRETARY 2
I-

BARBARA CASTLE
Two years This department has had two
years to make a difference Yet-
(stops herself)
Well shall we see what’s been achieved
in the last twelve months

She goes back to her desk checks notes-

BARBARA CASTLE (CONT’D)
26000 strikes In the United Kingdom
With 5 million working days lost as a
result Unions and management barely
speaking to each other Productivity
levels through the floor and our balance
of payments the wrong side of

set champagne corks popping is it

She stops gathers herself

blinks a pronounced tic And then Connie hurries in from
the kitchen

CONNIE

She carries a fizzy glass of something She holds it out
to him

CONNIE (CONTD)
Down in one-

He takes it But then he doesn’t drink it He places it
on a small table beside him and sits back picking up the

hooter goes and the girls look across on the point of
getting dressed But it is Brian so they simply
continue He looks frustrated Then scared as he
realises he must enter anyway This he does and at every
bench the women jiggle their bits wolf whistle and
generally make life hell for him

BRENDA
Hello BrianThat a cotton bob you got
in your pocketOr is it an hard on

He reaches into a sack he is carrying and shoves a letter
straight at Brenda She frowns but soon all the girls
have them Rita opens her envelope and reads She looks
furious and then catches Connie’s eye A second and Rita
marches off

As she arrives at the door Albert appears in his Ford
overalls coming for her decision She marches past him
thunder on her face glancing once at him as she strides
on He grins

pay settlement is reached-

MONTY

Monty has spoken for them all Mutterings of “equal pay”
are heard everywhere Rita turns to the girls

RITA
Well why not
(stares at the trusting faces
of the girls)
That’s what this dispute is really about
innit

Rita suddenly points to the lad seen earlier He sweeps
out the canteen now

RITA (CONTD)

They’ve put us on the same rate as
Brushin’ Brian The lowest rate in the
whole factorydespite the fact that we
have got considerable skill

(A few mumbled “trues” )
And there’s only one possible reason for
that’Cause we’re women and in the
work place women get paid less than men-
no matter what skill they got

(More support Agreement

Shouts now)
Which is why we gotta demand that from
now on there’s a level playin’ field and
rates of pay which reflect the job you
do not whether you’ve got a dick or not-

(cheers of support)
This strike is about one thing and one
thing only Fairness

at Vauxhall They don’t appear to have
any problem with the unions and that
seems to me because General Motors have a
much more collaborative approach to
Management Whereas at Ford you seem
only to deal with the unions because you
have toYou tolerate them And as a
result they’re much more entrenched and
aggressive in the way that they deal with
you

Tooley looks at her Then he smiles

TOOLEY
That’s a veryprogressive point of
view Lisa
(turns to alarmed Hopkins)
Isnt it

He stares at Hopkins his expression at once benign but

threatening Hopkins hesitates then turns to Lisa He
smiles but it’s a fragile thing Then-

file under one arm He slings it onto a far desk as
Hopkins tries to assert control

HOPKINS
Monty This is Mr Tooley He-

TOOLEY
I need you to break the strike for me Mr
TaylorAs soon as you can

Monty glances at Hopkins who also looks a little
surprised Monty scoffs

(to Hopkins)

I don’t have to listen to this-
He moves towards the door
TOOLEY
Keep going And six months from now your

union won’t exist

Monty stops Despite himself He turns back

TOOLEY (CONTD)
Industry can’t afford to pay women the
same rates as men Fact If it’s forced
to it will collapse under the extra wage
bill its workers will be laid off their
union subscriptions will disappear and
so finally will the unions which
collect them That’s youMonty

The women are now on picket before their entrance gates
They call out for Equal Pay Equality several chant
‘We Want Justice’ and ‘Support Our Struggle’ A lorry

others then steps across to join the chatting girls
Rita lowers her voice

staring at her not convinced Connie sighs then steps
back to rummage in her bag a diversion Rita moves over
Connie lowers her voice

“Had he fought for a country where the

You can do it at the bottom of the High

But this road all the way back to town
Ford built So it’s private property and
since you’re on strike you’re actually
out of contract which means you are
trespassin’ You gotta move to the public

highway-
CONNIE
We can’t turn the lorries round from
there-
COPPER
I’m sorryLook who’s in charge

Everyone looks at Rita but Connie steps forward

CONNIE

Rita turns wrong footed-
COPPER

women up the road-

CONNIE

Connie kicks her heel hard into his shin He cries out
letting go But the other coppers grab her as the girls
shove back against them A huge melee ensues The press

shoved one way and the other In a moment though
Connie screaming is extracted shoved in the van and
the coppers are away Silence immediately falls and Rita

turned to her Waiting

RITA

My best friend lost her husband recently
Durin’ the war he was a gunner in Fifty
Squadron in the RAF He got shot down one
timeon a raid to Essen and even though
he managed to bail out he was badly
injured I asked him once why he’d
joined the raf and he saidthey got the
best women

(Laughter in the hall She

nods upset)
Which they did

Eddie stares at Rita

RITA (CONTD)

But then he said you had to do
somethin’ And he’d always wanted to go
up in a plane

Her jaw tightens she feels the cause start to flood
through her veins

RITA (CONTD)
You had to do somethin’That was a
given Cause it was a matter of
principle You had to stand up do what
was right ‘cause otherwise you wouldn’t
be able to look yourself in the mirror
(stares at hall)
When did that change When did we in
this country start bein’ happy to do
nothin’ On what day did we decide we had
no duty to fairness no more

kept tellin’ us it’s fine You don’t
need to do the right thing cause there’s
nothin’ needs fixin’ And they said it
for so long we ended up believin’ it was
rightWell it ain’t right

It was wrong at the start it’s wrong
now and it’1l be wrong forever-

remember who you are and you accept that
this is a matter of principle Women are
entitled to the same rates of pay as men

I wanted you to fix this Not to make it
worse-
