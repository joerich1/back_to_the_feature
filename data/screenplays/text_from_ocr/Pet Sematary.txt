FADE IN ON

that most persistent summer SOUND crickets in high grass--
ree-ree-ree-ree This in dark which slowly

DISSOLVES TO
EXT A GRAVE MARKER SUMMER DAY
Its a plywood cross leaning aslant Written on the crossarm in
black paint which has faded SMUCKY HE WAS OBEDIENT The letters
are faded They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a
child
MAIN TITLES BEGIN
EXT ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER
A childs printing again this time on a chunk of warped crating
BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER
1971-1974
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
EXT TWO MARKERS
I think all these shots are LAP DISSOLVES All is silence but for
the crickets and the wind stirring the grass Around the markers
themselves the grass has been clipped short and by some markers
there are flowers in cheap vases Crisco cans Skippy peanut
butter jars etc
These two markers IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1
1965 (on a wide flat board) and GEN PATTON (OUR GOOD DOG) APRIL
1958 (another board)
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
EXT FIVE OR SIX MARKERS

We cant read all of them some are too faded (or the
gravestones themselves too degenerated) but we can see now that
this woodland clearings a rather eerie -- and well-populated --
animal graveyard

We can see POLYNESIA 1953 and HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER
LIVED HANNAHS tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood
painstakingly hammered flat

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
EXT ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY

From here we can see most of the clearing which is surrounded by
forest pines We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are
arranged in rough concentric circles On the far side of this
clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard
clearing The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which
hold up a crude arch We can see no writing on this side -- the
words on the arch face those arriving along the path

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
EXT THE ARCH FROM THE PATH SIDE CU

MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE Written on the arch in faded black paint is
the work of some long-gone child PET SEMATARY

THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO THEN PANS SLOWLY
DOWN to look through the arch From this angle we are looking
across to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead
branches at the back of the graveyard Its maybe twenty-five feet
from side to side and about nine feet high At either end are
thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible

AS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the
deadfall And as it does we realize that there is a horrible
snarling face in those branches Is this an accident Coincidence
Our imagination Perhaps the audience will wonder THE CAMERA
HOLDS ON IT and then we

DISSOLVE TO
BLACK And a white title card MOVING DAY
EXT A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY EVENING

SOUND of crickets ree-ree-ree-ree

To the left of this house a big empty field Behind it the
woods Before it a wide two-lane road

The house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a
shedgarage attached In front of it is a sign which reads QUINN
REALTORS 292 HAMMOND STREET BANGOR A big SOLD strip like a
bumper sticker has been plastered across it diagonally

GROWING SOUND the rumble of a truck A big big truck It belts
between the CAMERA and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver
body and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters Its
short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke Behind it
comes a Ford wagon which slows signals and turns into the
driveway of the house weve been looking at

EXT REAR OF THE WAGON

As LOUIS CREED brings it to a stop we get a good look at the
license plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker (HAVE YOU HUGGED
YOUR MD TODAY)

The ENGINE SOUND stops For a moment or two we hear only the ree-
ree-ree-ree of crickets Then

ELLIE CREED (voice)
Is this our new house daddy

LOUIS CREED (voice)
This is it
EXT THE WAGON A NEW ANGLE
The two front doors and one back door open LOUIS CREED about 32
gets out from the drivers side RACHEL CREED his wife gets out

from the passenger side From the rear door comes ELLIE CREED a
girl of 6 They are staring fascinated at the house

They come together the three of them by the front of the wagon
still staring at the house LOUIS is clearly nervous

LOUIS
Sowhat do you think

RACHEL begins to smile She turns to LOUIS and hugs him

RACHEL
Its gorgeous

ELLIE
Am I really gonna have my own room

LOUIS
Yes

ELLIE
Yaay
She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging
down from the bough of a tree

ELLIE (to RACHEL)
Is that a swing

RACHEL
Yes but the rope might be--

ELLIE
Yaay

She goes running toward it RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile

LOUIS
Let her go Its cool

RACHEL
Louis the house is beautiful

They kiss--gently at first then more passionately As he draws
her more tightly against him a baby--GAGE--begins to cry from the
car LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch

RACHEL
The Master of Disaster awakes

This SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat

LOUIS
And Buckaroo Banzai

RACHEL

Come on--lets parole

em

They walk to the car RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors
LOUIS to the rear of the wagon

INT THE FRONT SEAT WITH RAHEL AND GAGE

GAGE is sitting in his car seat not exactly crying but certainly
yelling to be let out The seat dash and floorboards are
littered with roadmaps soda cans Big Mac boxes and similar
crud These folks have driven all the way from Chicago to Maine in
this station wagon and the wagon looks it

RACHEL
Decided to wake up and see what home

looks like huh

She begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses GAGE is just
wearing a t-shirt and a diaper Hes fifteen months old
EXT THE REAR OF THE WAGON WITH LOUIS

He opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier We see a big
tomcat inside--mostly what were aware of are shining green eyes

ELLIE (voice)
Daddy Mommy I see a path

LOUIS cat carrier still in hand turns toward

EXT ELLIE IN THE TIRE SWING

Shes got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs
EXT THE VIEW UP TOWARD THE WOODS ELLIES POV

We see the field and a clearly marked and mown path leading up
its flank and into the dark woods

THE CAMERA DIPS AND PENDULUMS as ELLIE swings
EXT RACHEL AND GAGE (FRONT OF THE CAR)
RACHEL (irritated)
Not so high Ellie You dont know

how strong that rope is

She puts GAGE down He totters a bit on his little legs and then
stands there looking at his sister

EXT THE ROPE AND THE BRANCH CU

The bark has rubbed off the branch--it looks like a bone peeping
through decayed flesh The rope is old discolored And it is
fraying away as we look at it Soon ELLIE like Humpty Dumpty is
going to have a great fall

EXT LOUIS (REAR OF THE CAR)

Hes set the cat-carrier down and is straightening up

ELLIE (raptuous voice)
Wheee

LOUIS
Ellie you heard your m---

His eyes widen

EXT ELLIE
ELLIE
Wh--

SOUND A heavy twang as the rope breaks The tire swing--with
ELLIE still inside it--goes crashing to the grass ELLIE screams
and begins to cry--a little hurt and a lot surprised

LOUIS and RACHEL run to her

LOUIS RACHEL
Ellie Are you all right Honey Are you okay

EXT ELLIE RACHEL LOUIS A CLOSER SHOT

ELLIES parents reach the tangle of tire rope and six-year-old
girl

ELLIE
Hurrts It hurrrrts

LOUIS
Anyone who can scream that loud isnt
ready for intensive care just yet--
looks like she just skinned her knee

Nevertheless he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from
the tire RACHEL helps

EXT GAGE

Hes standing in the driveway by the front of the car utterly
forgotten in the heat of the moment His diaper is sagging quite a
bit the boy needs a change

He stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit then loses
interest CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks down the side of the station
wagon little bare feet slapping on the asphalt He stops for a
moment at the back looking at the cat-carrier which LOUIS never
got around to opening CHURCH is staring hopefully out through the
mesh

GAGE
Hi-Durch

CHURCH
Waow

GAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carriers door No soap
Either he cant solve the latch or his fingers dont have the
strength Anyway he stops trying after a moment
SOUND Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one
EXT THE ROAD (GAGES POV)

A big tanker truck--silver body ORINCO written on the side in
blue letters--blasts by

EXT GAGE BY THE CAT CARRIER

The windlash if the passing truck blows GAGES hair back from his
forehead We should be scared here--not by the truck but by
GAGES lack of fear Hes smiling happy

GAGE
Druck

He starts down the driveway toward the road

EXT LOUIS RACHEL ELLIE (AT THE SWING)

ELLIE has been disentangled from the swing Shes sitting by the
wreckage at the end of the driveway weeping hysterically (as much
from tiredness as from pain I think) as LOUIS and RACHEL examine

her scraped knee The wound doesnt look too serious

LOUIS (to RACHEL)
Would you get the first aid kit

ELLIE (screaming)
Not the stingy stuff I dont want the
stingy stuff daddy
RACHEL suddenly looks around toward
EXT THE FRONT OF THE WAGON (RACHELS POV)
No one there

EXT RACHEL ELLIE LOUIS BY THE SWING

RACHEL
Gages gone

LOUIS
Jesus the road

They get up together

EXT GAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD

A truck is coming A great big one
EXT ANGLE ON THE TRUCK CU

The grille looks like a tombstone thats learned how to snarl

EXT GAGE

He takes a step into the roadand then big gnarled hands grab

him

GAGE looks rather surprised at this but not worried--this kid is

used to being

picked up and treated humanely To GAGE strangers

are as interesting aswell as interesting as Orinco trucks

EXT GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL

The fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old

blue jeans a
a faded khaki

faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt Over this he wears
vest with bright silver buttons His face is deeply

wrinkled and kindly

JUD CRANDALL (to GAGE)
No you dont my friend--not in
that road

But he softens this with a grin GAGE grins back at him

GAGE
Drucks

JUD (low)
No shit Sherlock

JUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon Here hes

joined by LOUI
brings up the

He sticks out
crushing JayCe

S and RACHEL out of breath and really scared ELLIE
rear Shes still sniffling

RACHEL

JUD (hands him to her)
He was headed for the road looked
like I corralled him for you missus

RACHEL
Thank you Thank you so much

LOUIS
Yes--thanks Im Louis Creed

his hand and JUD shakes it LOUIS takes it easy--no
es grip or anything like that--the old guy looks as

if he might have arthritis
JUD
Jud Crandall I live just across the road

RACHEL
Im Rachel Thanks again for saving
the wandering minstrel boy here

JUD
No harm no foul But you want to watch
out for that road Those damn trucks go
back and forth all day and most of the
night

He leans over toward ELLIE

JUD
Who might you be little Miss

ELLIE

Alden Lane Dearborn Michigan (Pause)
At least I used to

JUD
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow

clam here Ellen Creed

ELLIE (to LOUIS)
Are clams really happy

They all laugh--even GAGE

RACHEL
Excuse me Mr Crandall--Ive got to

JUD
Same here Come over and visit when

As RACHEL carrying GAGE moves away

ELLIE (worries)
Daddy do I really have to have the
stingy stuff

LOUIS
No-I guess not
Yayyy

She goes belting off

SOUND A truck engine

EXT

ELLIE

JUD (amused)

I guess your daughter there aint
going to die after all

LOUIS (also amused)

I guess not

JUD

House has stood empty for too long
Its damn good to see people in it again

A MOVING VAN

gearing down

It blinks and comes lumbering into the Creeds driveway

EXT

EXT

GAGE has been changed

LOUIS AND JUD

LOUIS

Hey--they actually found the place

Movin

JUD

ins mighty thirsty work I

usually sit out on my porch of an evening
and pour a couple of beers over mdinner
Come on over and join me if you want

LOUIS

Well maybe I----

RACHEL (voice)

Louis whats this

RACHEL AND GAGE

and RACHEL is following him as he explores

the nearest edges of the new homestead They are fairly close to
the wreckage of the tire swing and here is the head of the path
ELLIE has already glimpsed

EXT

LOUIS AND JUD

They cross to the van The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just
climbing out of the van
FIRST MOVER
You Mr Creed

LOUIS
Yes Just a second

EXT RACHEL AND GAGE AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH

Shes holding GAGE on her hip now and both of them are looking at
that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the
deepening twilight LOUIS and JUD join them

LOUIS
The movers-—

RACHEL
Yes--I know This path Louis Where does
it go

LOUIS

I dont have the slightest idea When I saw
the house this field was under four feet
of snow

RACHEL (smiling)
I bet Mr Crandall knows

JUD nods He smiles too but underneath the smile we sense that
he is serious

JUD
Oh ayuh I know Its a good story and
a good walk too Ill take you up there
sometime and tell you the story too--
after you get settled in

He smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of
understanding and real liking in spite of the age difference
between the CREEDS and JUD

EXT THE CREED HOUSE NIGHT

SOUND Crickets Ree--ree--ree-ree

Theres one light upstairs one downstairs Perhaps we see the
path glimmering away into the field Either by virtue of it being
mown or by virtue of some gentle optical trick Maybe

INT THE LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Theres a light on in the kitchen but it just casts a dim glow in
here The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor Its
going to be nice but now its just a big bare box with movers
cartons stacked all over the place

LOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi and he looks pretty damned
tired--anyone whos ever moved house and can remember the first
night in the new place will understand

He finishes the last of the Pepsi and surveys the living room He
sits on one of the bigger boxes takes cigarettes from his pocket
and lights one He drops the spent match in the empty can and
taps into the can during the scene

SOUND Feet coming down the stairs The door on the far side of
the room opens and RACHEL comes in wearing a nightgown

RACHEL (crossing to LOUIS)
Kids are asleep doc

LOUIS
Great

He hugs her She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just
two good people in all the big darkness of their new house

RACHEL
Youre not really going over to have a
beer with that old guy are you

LOUIS
Well Ive got a million questions about
the area and---

RACHEL
---and youll end up doing a free
consultation on his arthritis or urinary
problems and---

LOUIS
Did you see his shirt

RACHEL (giggles)
Sure Bruce Springsteen

LOUIS
I really do have a million questions
about the areabut the thing Im
really curious about is how come this
octogenarian Yankee is decorating the
slumped remains of his pecs with the
Boss

She laughs
EXT THE PATH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE NIGHT

Pervasive SOUND of the crickets as LOUIS comes rather hesitantly
up the crazy-paved path from the roads edge

JUD (voice)
That you doc

EXT THE SCREENED-IN PORCH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE

We hear the SQUEAK of a rocker we see the dim red fitful glow of
JUDS Pall Mall We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman
earphones

EXT LOUIS

LOUIS
Its me

INT THE PORCH WITH JUD

The Walkman is in his lap He switches it off and puts the
headphones casually around his neck like a kid

JUD
Well come on up and have a beer

INT THE PORCH A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT

LOUIS comes on up JUD has got a pail of ice beside his chair with
some cans of beer in it He opens one and hands it to LOUIS

JUD
You need a glass

LOUIS
Not at all

JUD
Good for you

LOUIS drinks half the can at a draught

LOUIS
God thats fine

JUD
Aint it just The man who invented
beer Louis that man was having a
prime day for himself
LOUIS
What were you listening to

JUD
Allman Brothers

LOUIS
What

JUD
The Eat A Peach album God they were
good before drugs and bad luck caught
up with them Listen to this Louis

He passes the headphones over LOUIS puts them on JUD presses the
Walkmans PLAY button

SOUND Ramblin Man blasts us out of our seats
LOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head

JUD
Im sorry Wait

He turns it down

Try that

LOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments
Its the instrumental break Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot
Fenders LOUIS takes the earphones off

LOUIS
Nice

JUD
I like rock and roll NoI guess
thats too mild I love it Since
my ears started to die out on me
its the only music I can really hear
And since my wife diedI dunno some-
times a little rock and roll fills up
night Not always but sometimes (Pause)
One more time--welcome to Ludlow Hope
your time here will be a happy one

LOUIS (great sincerity)
Thank you Mr Crandall

He drinks again--they both do Theres a moment of companionable
silence here broken by the SOUND of a big truck They look
toward
EXTINT THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN)

One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are
little amber running lights on top of it Its going fast too--
sweeps by in a blast of air

INT THE PORCH WITH LOUIS AND JUD

LOUIS (wincing)
Jesus

JUD (lights a cigarette)
Thats one mean road all right--you
remember that path your wife commented on

LOUIS
The one that goes into the woods--sure

JUD
That road--and those Orinco trucks--
are the two main reasons its there

LOUIS
Whats at the end of it

JUD (smiles)
Another day--after you get settled ina
bit Meantime doc---

Here JUD raises his glass in a toast

JUD (continues)
Heres to your bones

LOUIS clinks his glass against JUDS

LOUIS
And yours

fq

They drink
EXT ROUTE 9 NIGHT

LOUIS crosses from the CRANDALL side to his own and the CAMERA
FOLLOWS as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon He
pauses for a moment looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new
house Then something--the CRY of an OWL perhaps--draws his
attention the other waytoward the path

He walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in
a wide cut swath thats a bit ghostly in the dark

A SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him and LOUIS
recoils with a startled muffled cry

EXT CHURCH

The cat sure who--or what--else We see his big green eyes in
the dark as he cries his strange feline hello Waow

EXT LOUIS AND CHURCH AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH

LOUIS
Church God you scared the life
out of me

CHURCH
Waow

LOUIS bends and picks up the cat As he does that truck SOUND
comes again and he looks toward

EXT THE ROAD LOUISS POV
Another Orinco tanker drones by fast
EXT LOUIS AND CHURCH
LOUIS (to the cat)
I know one thing that will keep you
home good buddy

He starts toward the house

BLACK And in that blackness we see a second title card THE DEAD
SPEAK

INT A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD CU DAY

JOLANDER DVM And below in even bigger letters 2) ELLIES
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

THE CAMERA PANS LEFT showing us the kitchen There are still a
few cardboard cartons around but the place is getting in shape

We look out the window and see the CREEDS led by JUD CRANDALL
climbing the path toward the woods LOUIS has got GAGE in a
Gerrypak

EXT AT THE TOP OF THE HILL WITH CREEDS AND JUD
They are also at the edge of the woods JUD stops and lets them
catch up

JUD
Take a look behind you

They turn around and their faces express their wonder

LOUIS
My God

RACHEL
Its beautiful

EXT THE VIEW

It is indeed beautiful The CREED house is in the fg Route 9
just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning
along) but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river
valley dozing under a fall sky of clear blue

EXT AT THE TOP OF THE HILL WITH JUD AND THE CREEDS

JUD
You folks ready to go on

LOUIS
Sure

ELLIE
But where are we going Mr Crandall

JUD
Youll see soon enough hon

They go into the woods still following the path
EXT FOREST DAY

These are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight
shafting through them It looks as though man has never made his
mark here

THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them on the path Here it is
carpeted with pine needles but it is just as clearly marked

JUD stops LOUIS looks glad of the rest hes sweating and there
are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypaks straps
are

LOUIS
Who owns the woods up ahead Paper
companies

JUD
Nope The Micmac Indians Whats up
ahead is all thats left of their
tribal lands

ELLIE (giggling)
Micmac Ricmac Kickmac Sickmac

JUD (smiles)
Ayuh its a funny word aint it

You tired of totin that yowwen yet doc

LOUIS
Not yethow much further is it

JUD
Aw youll be okay Less than a mile

He starts off again fresh as a daisy ELLIE scampers after him
LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back Then
they press on

EXT THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY
EXT JUD AND THE CREEDS ON THE PATH

JUD (stopping)
This is the place honey

ELLIE is of course second Se tries to read the words on the arch
but cant She whips around to look at her mother

ELLIE

A strange expression has come over RACHELS face--she doesnt like
this Not a bit

RACHEL

misspelled butthats what it
says

She runs for the arch RACHEL starts looks more uneasy than ever

RACHEL

RACHEL (a bit lame)
Be careful

EXT ELLIE

She goes racing into the Pet Sematary

EXT RACHEL LOUIS JUD

JUD lights a cigarette with a wooden match using his thumbnail

JUD

Louis--its killed a lot of pets
and made a lot of kids unhappy
But at least something good come
of it This place

ELLIE (excited voice)
Mom Dad Youghtta see it

EXT ELLIE AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY

She surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight then runs
toward the center pausing to investigate some of the markers as
she goes We clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings

EXT RACHEL LOUIS JUD

They are walking slowly toward that rude archway LOUIS is
extremely interested in all this but its becoming clearer and
clearer that RACHEL is troubled They stop and look in

RACHEL
How can you call it a good thing
A graveyard for pets killed in the
road Built and maintained by broken-
hearted children

JUD
Well but Missus Creed It aint
quite that way deah

LOUIS
I think its rather extraordinary

RACHEL
Extraordinarily morbid maybe
Shes growing more and more upset JUD looks at her curiously

JUD
Wellthey have to learn about death
somehow now dont they Missus Creed
The little ones

RACHEL (coldly)
Why

JUD
Wellwell because--

ELLIE (voice)
Mommy Daddy Look at me

EXT ELLIE ON THE DEADFALL

She has begun to climb it and this looks like an extremely
dangerous proposition ELLIE however is having the time of her
life A branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches

nimbly to the next one up

EXT THE GROWNUPS AT THE ARCH

JUD (alarmed)
No honey You dont want to go
climbing on that Come on down
He hurries in
EXT ELIIE ON THE DEADFALL

She looks back at JUD

ELLIE

EXT ELLIES FOOT CU

The branch shes on breaks with a dry CRRRACK Her foot drops down
suddenly

EXT ELLIE AND JUD

She totters backward pinwheeling her arms and JUD catches her as
she falls Not much of a catch because she wasnt too far up

LOUIS joins JUD and ELLIE GAGE jounces along on his back

LOUIS
Have you got a death-wish Ellen

ELLIE
Well I thought it was safe--

JUD
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns

He points again and Ellen goes over for a look-see

EXT ELLEN AT THE GRAVE MARKER

words laboriously tracing them with her finger

ELLEN

EXT JUD AND LOUIS

JUD

time I finished I had blisters all
over my hands and a hell of a crick

ELLIE looks awed LOUIS looks a little awed too

JUD sweeps a hand around indicating the whole sematary but is
still looking at ELLEN

JUD
Do you know what this place is
Ellie Oh I know you know its a
boneyard but a bone aint nothing
and even a whole pile of ‘em dont
amount to much Do you know what a
graveyard really is

ELLIE
WellI guess not

JUD
Its a place where the dead speak
Missy

He sees her startled uneasy expression and laughs He ruffles her
hair reassuringly

JUD
No--not right out loud Their stones
speakor their markers Even if the
marker aint nothing but a tin can
someone wrote on with a Magic Marker
it speaks Aint that so Louis

LOUIS
I think it is so Ellie

ELLIE
What if you cant read whats
written on there anymore

JUD
Well it still says some animal got
laid down here after dont it

ELLIE
Yes--

LOUIS
And that someone cared enough about
that animal to mark the spot

ELLIE
To remember

JUD (smiles)
Yes To remember This aint a scary
place Ellie Its a place of rest
and speaking Can you remember that

ELLIE (a little awed)
Yes sir

tweezers Hes wearing glasses

ELLIE comes in wearing a nightgown She watches him for awhile

LOUIS (not looking around)

LOUIS
Well its always better to take
precautions--but Im sure Church

INT JUST OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR

youre in a high schooland thats a
very long time

ELLIE
It doesnt seem long to me It seems
short I think the whole thing about
pets dying s-s-sucks

Poor kids bawling her eyes out now LOUIS folds her into his arms
and she hugs him tightly wanting his comfort

LOUIS
If it was up to me Id let Church live
to be a hundredbut I dont make up
the rules

ELLIE (muffled)
Well who does God I suppose But hes
not Gods cat Hes my cat Let God get
His own if He wants one Not mine Not
mine Not--

She breaks down completely sobbing and LOUIS rocks her back and
forth

INT THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN WITH RACHEL
She is crying silently
INT ELLIES BEDROOM NIGHT

She is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness An oblong shaft of
light falls on her illuminating her more clearly Shes asleep
with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her
mouth

INT THE DOORWAY WITH RACHEL

RACHEL looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly
closes the door

INT LOUISS AND RACHELS BEDROOM NIGHT

LOUIS is in his pajamas propped up on pillows on his side of the
bed There a number of medical books scattered around him and hes
making notes from one as RACHEL comes in

RACHEL
Shes finally asleep

LOUIS
She was a little over-excited
thats all Poor kid

RACHEL

It was that place That creepy cemetery
up in the woods Whatever disease the
kids in this town have got I dont want
Ellie to catch it

LOUIS
Jesus Rachel whats got into you

RACHEL
Do you think I didnt hear her tonight
crying as if her heart would break
Here she is thinking Church is going to
die

It should be clear to us by now that despite her words RACHEL is
much more upset than ELLIE was LOUIS slowly puts his notebook
aside and caps his pen

LOUIS
Rachelsomeday Church is going to
die

RACHEL (whirls on him)
That is hardly the point Church is
not going to die today or tomorrow--
Never mind I can see you dont have
the slightest idea what Im talking about

She stalks to the bathroom which adjoins LOUIS follows She goes
in and slams the door He goes for the knob

LOUIS
Rachel--

SOUND CLICK OF THE LOCK

LOUIS stares at the door bewildered and upset

EXT ROUTE 9 NIGHT

Here comes a big Orinco truck droning along headlights glaring
INT LOUISS AND RACHELS BEDROOM

The headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see LOUIS
and RACHEL asleep each as far over to hisher own side as heshe
can get with a big empty space in the middle

Lights and TRUCK SOUNDS slowly fade

INT GAGE MORNING

Cheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way
across the tray of his high-chair--it looks a little like a map of
the Pacific islands done by a guy who only had a yellow crayon
Now he scoops up a handful and throws them

INT THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH ELLIE

Splat Eggs on the serving plate of toast

ELLIE
Yee-uck Gross

INT THE KITCHEN A WIDER SHOT

RACHEL is at the sink doing dishes (we see the blackboard with
its message near her)

LOUIS comes in wearing a sport-coat and slacks ready for his
first day on the joband ELLIE is in a pretty first day of
school dress

LOUIS
He cant help it babe Emily Post is
going to be beyond him for a few years
INT BY THE KITCHEN DOOR

Here is the cat-carrier with CHURCH inside it He waows unhappily
INT THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH ELLIE AND GAGE

ELLIE gets down and goes across to the cat-carrier

ELLIE
I dont want him to get his nuts
cut daddy What if he dies

INT RACHEL AND LOUIS BY THE SINK

LOUIS looks shocked and amused by ELLIES colorful choice of
words

LOUIS
Good God Whered you hear that

INT ELLIE

ELLIE
Missy Dandridge And she says its a
operation

INT RACHEL AND LOUIS BY THE SINK

LOUIS tries to kiss RACHELS mouth She turns her head slightly so
he gets her cheek instead Shes still mad LOUISS amusement
dies

RACHEL
Honey Church will be fine

INT ELLIE BY THE CAT CARRIER

ELLIE
But what if he dies and has to
go to the Pet Sematary

INT LOUIS AND RACHEL BY THE SINK

She gives him a look as if to say There Now do you understand
what you did

RACHEL
Dont be silly Church is not going
to die

LOUIS
According to what Mr Crandall says the
roads a lot more dangerous than the
operation Church will be just the same
Well--almost the same--and we wont have
to worry about him getting turned into
catburgers by one of those damn Orinco
trucks

At this RACHEL tightens up still more in that funny way--shes
actually angered by LOUISS reference to catburgers--but under the
anger we sense she is deeply shocked as a prudish woman might be
shocked by a dirty joke For RACHEL thats just what death is

RACHEL
Thats enough of that kind of talk

LOUIS
I just said--

RACHEL
I know what you just said Ellie
clear your place

ELLIE goes slowly back to the table

ELLIE (sets the plate down)
Im scared What if school here isnt
like in Chicago Im scared and I want
to go h-h-home

ELLIE bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face
INT THE KITCHEN A NEW ANGLE (FEATURES LOUIS AND RACHEL)

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they go to the table to comfort ELLIE

RACHEL
Youll be fine Ellie Now you can be
excused Go and wash your face

LOUIS
And Church will be fine

ELLIE (anxious)
Do you promise Daddy

LOUIS
Well honeyyou know that

RACHEL
Dont shilly-shally Louis Give
the little girl her promise
LOUIS (reluctantly)
Church will be fine I promise

ELLIE
Yayyyy

She runs off cheered up And RACHEL is cheered up too

RACHEL
Thank you Louis

LOUIS
Oh youre welcome Only if some-
thing should go wrong while hes under
the gas--its a one-in-a-thousand shot
but it happens--you explain to her

He gets up and leaves the table She looks after him stunned and
a little frightened

INT GAGE

GAGE (conversationally)
Here Durch

He picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and
throws it in the direction of the cat-carrier

INT THE CAT-CARRIER

CHURCH is close to the mesh looking out Scrambled eggs hit the
mesh driving him back surprised

EXT THE CREED HOUSE MORNING

The school bus pulls up red lights flashing ELLIE runs toward it
across the lawn with her lunch-box

EXT LOUIS RACHEL AND GAGE IN THE FRONT DOORWAY

RACHEL

LOUIS grabs GAGES hand and makes him wave it

GAGE
Bye-bye

EXT THE BUS

ELLIE climbs aboard The red flashers go out and the bus pulls
away
EXT THE CREED DRIVEWAY MORNING

The station wagon is parked there LOUIS comes out with a heavy
briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other He opens
the wagons doorgate

A small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS
A rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the
front of her car Her color is bad This is MISSY DANDRIDGE She
looks at the cat-carrier

MISSY
Gonna get his--

LOUIS
--nuts cut yes Thank you Missy
for introducing that colorful phrase
into my daughters vocabulary

MISSY
Dont mention it

She opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat
pile of folded sheets She reaches for them then winces and
presses her hands against her midriff for a moment as if with an
attack of indigestion

LOUIS (sees this)
Hows that belly-ache of yours

MISSY (gets the sheets)
No better and no worse

LOUIS
You ought to see a doctor about it

MISSY
Itll pass They always do

She starts toward the house with the sheets

EXT THE SIDE YARD MORNING

RACHEL hurries past MISSY who turns to look and then goes on into
the house LOUIS has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the

wagon and closed the doorgate as RACHEL reaches him

RACHEL (anxious)
Still friends doc
LOUIS appears to consider this seriously for a momentand then
he smiles and hugs her They kiss

RACHEL
Thank God I was a little worried
there Have a great first day at
school doc No broken bones

LOUIS (smiles)
Not so much as a sprain

EXT VICTOR PASCOW AND FRIENDS MORNING

PASCOW is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one
girl They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him not to
drop him A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the
bearers

PASCOWS head is upside down to the CAMERA which retreats ahead
of the advancing students Fixed eyes stare Half of his head has
been shattered inward Before the catastrophe he was a husky male
of about twenty Hes dressed in a U of M muscle shirt and red
jogging shorts

THE CAMERA PULLS JERKILY TO ONE SIDE allowing the bearers to
mount the steps of a brick building The infirmary The lookers-on
break to either side The infirmary doors open

EXT NURSE CHARLTON AT THE DOORS
Shes the head nurse a tough old babe of about fifty

CHARLTON
Holy Jesus

(turns)
Steve Steve Dr Creed Dr Creed
weve got a mess here Stat

The bearers sweep past her and inside leaving a red smear of
blood across the midriff of MARCY CHARLTONS uniform

INT THE INFIRMARY RECEPTION AREA

THE CAMERA will show us all we need to see but its movements will
seem almost random this is like being in the hotel kitchen after
Sirhan shot Bobby

As the students bring in PASCOW LOUIS comes running followed by
STEVE MASTERTON his PA Standing to one side are two student

nurses in candystriper uniforms Theyre boggled and horrified

LOUIS kneels THE CAMERA RUSHES FORWARD shoving between
onlookers LOUIS looks at the wound Theres shattered bone and
pulsing brain tissue beneath

Theres a scream the girl who was carrying one corner of the
blanket is having hysterics

GIRL
Vic Vic Oh Christ Vic

LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
Get her out Get them all out

CHARLTON puts her arms around the girl

GIRL (struggling)
No No He cant die He cant die

THE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from
STEVE and shines it in PASCOWS bulging fixed eyes

CHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out
the door

LOUIS
Steve get the ambulance over here
right now Hes got to go to EMMC

STEVE
The ambulance is at Sonnys Sunoco
downtown getting--

LOUIS
--a new muffler oh shit--

PASCOW makes a weird gargling noise Blood suddenly spurts out of
his mouth He begins to seizure

One of the candystripers shrieks THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the
student nurses One turns and throws up on the wall

CHARLTON rushes over

CANDYSTRIPER
I cant look at itI cant stand it

CHARLTON (slaps her)
Yes you by God can Go get the hard
stretcher

As they start away one helping the other down the hall and as
CHARLTON starts over to where PASCOW lies dying on his blanket
THE CAMERA DROPS TO LOUIS AND STEVE
LOUIS
Help me hold him

They hold PASCOWS spasming body

STEVE
It wouldnt matter if we did have
the ambulance

LOUIS
It wouldnt matter if we had the SST

PASCOW begins to quiet

LOUIS
Hes going Steve go call the motor-
pool Marcy roll out the crash wagon

CHARLTON
It wont--

LOUIS
I know it wont But lets for Gods
sake do it by the rules

She leaves LOUIS is alone with PASCOW CHARLTON has drawn the
drapes so the doctor and the dying man have complete if temporary
privacy

INT LOUIS AND PASCOW A CLOSER SHOT

LOIS
There wasnt even supposed to be a
sprain today my friend--thats what
I told her

PASCOWS fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand bear-traps
LOUISS right wrist The dying man pulls him slowly but
relentlessly down until their faces are only inches apart

PASCOW
»-Pet Sematary

LOUIS recoils breaking the grip of the handbut he cannot quite
snap the grip of those bright dying eyes Blood leaks from
PASCOWS mouth

LOUIS (whispers)
W-What did you say

PASCOW struggles hard to speak again At first he can only gurgle
PASCOW
Its not the real cemetery
(Long pause) The soil of a mans
heart is stonier Louisa man
grows what he canand tends it
LOUIS leans forward again terrified yet needing to know

LOUIS
How do you know my name

PASCOW (gurgling)

LOUIS grabs PASCOWS bloody shoulder

LOUIS (low but urgent)
Dammit how do you know my name

INT HALLWAY ENTRANCE TO RECEPTION WITH STEVE

PASCOW spews more blood as STEVE kneels beside LOUIS
INT THE MAIN INFIRMARY HALLWAY

CHARLTON is pushing along your basic MEDCU goodie-cart covered
with emergency life-saving gear

INT LOUIS STEVE PASCOW
PASCOWS spasms are weakening

LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
Never mind Hes going

PASCOWS hand comes up and paws at LOUISS shirt leaving a bloody
handprint Then it falls limply back PASCOW is dead

LOUIS
Steve will you get a sheet to cover
him with
STEVE leaves the frame and LOUIS stares fixedly down at the body
of VICTOR PASCOW He closes the eyes

EXT A COUNTRY ROAD LATE AFTERNOON
Its the leading edge of Maine fall sunny and wonderful Here
comes LOUISS station wagon As it reaches THE CAMERA it swivels
to TRACK
RADIO (voice-over)
Tragedy struck on the first day of the
University of Maines fall semester
when Victor Pascow a nineteen-year-old
sophomore--
INT THE CAR WITH LOUIS
He still looks shocked by the tragedy The dying mans bloody
handprint is partly visible on LOUISS shirt in spite of his

sport-coat

LOUIS abruptly turns off the radio and swerves over to the side of
the road

EXT THE STATION WAGON
IT comes to a slueing shuddering stop almost going in the ditch

voice--and the opening door was like a bomb--shes still fast
asleep LOUIS looks back toward PASCOWand then gets out of bed
Hes naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms
INT PASCOW

He turns and leaves the doorway

INT LOUIS

He reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at

RACHEL is sleeping as before and LOUIS himself is also in bed
asleep although his rest is uneasyas if hes having a bad
dream

INT THE DOORWAY WITH LOUIS

LOUIS (relieved)
Oh Thank God

Hurry up doc

INT THE KITCHEN

LOUIS enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the
shedgarage This door stands open LOUIS pauses by it

PASCOW (low)
Come on doc
LOUIS goes into
INT THE SHEDGARAGE

The station wagon is a dark hulk LOUIS crosses to it and stands
perplexed

PASCOW looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him LOUIS
turns and suddenly his face is less than an inch from PASCOWS

mutilated face

PASCOW
Lets go doc

LOUIS (moans)
I dont like this dream

PASCOW
Who said you were dreaming

He begins to move toward the garage door After a moment LOUIS
follows him

EXT THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE LONG NIGHT

We can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods--PASCOW
and behind him LOUIS

EXT THE PET SEMATARY ARCH

CAMERA HOLDS THEN PANS DOWN as LOUIS passes under the arch
EXT LOUIS CLOSE

He looks around obviously afraid

EXT THE PET SEMATARY LOUISS POV

We can see why By starlight this is one scary place

EXT LOUIS

He suddenly sees something else and now his fear is close to
terror

EXT THE DEADFALL LOUISS POV
The face is back in the tumbled branches It yawns and snarls

EXT LOUIS
He walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized PASCOWS hand falls
on his shoulder LOUIS turns terrified

EXT PASCOW CLOSE
He really is a dreadful mangled mess

PASCOW
This is the place where the dead speak

EXT LOUIS
He closes his eyes

LOUIS
I want to wake up I want to wake up
thats all I--

EXT LOUIS AND PASCOW

PASCOW
The door must not be opened The
barrier must not be crossed Dont
go on doc No matter how much you
feel you have to Theres more
power here than you know

He points at
EXT THE DEADFALL

That grinning face--and perhaps now there are other effects as
well subtle but there Dim red light A misty smoke drifting
through the tumbled dead branches The director will know

After a moment there is a HUGE GRUNTING ROAR from the woods behind
the deadfall--it sounds like no animal weve ever heard before
There is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree
like a toothpic

EXT PASCOW AND LOUIS

LOUIS has crumbled to PASCOWS feet His eyes are squeezed tightly
shut

LOUIS

Please I want to wake up Leave me
alone Its not my fault you died you
were as good as dead when they brought
you in--

PASCOW
The power of this place is old and
always restless Sometimes the dead
do more than speak Remember doc

CAMERA BEGINS MOVING SLOWLY IN ON LOUIS

LOUIS
Leave me alone

PASCOW
Remember

CAMERA IS TIGHT ON LOUIS

INT LOUIS IN BED

His eyes snap open Hes in his own bedroom As he sits up THE
CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS OUT so we can see that hes in bed alone the
covers on RACHELS side are thrown back

After the initial confusion and fear LOUIS looks deeply relieved
he looks the way I suppose we all look upon waking up and
realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all

RACHEL (calls)
You up doc

LOUIS

He throws the covers back and freezes

INT THE CREED LIVING ROOM AFTERNOON

Theres a bowling match on TV LOUIS dressed in his Saturday
afternoon grubs (jeans and a Maine sweatshirt) has the phone to
his ear

JUD CRANDALL (phone filter)

EXT THE CRANDALL HOUSE MEDIUM-LONG

Were looking across from the CREED lawn LOUIS waits for one of
those trucks to go blasting by and then crosses Its cold and
windy Downed autumn leaves fly

LOUIS and JUD stand over a small furry body like mourners

JUD (voice)
Well

EXT THE CATS BODY

Its lying on its belly and doesnt look much damaged Hands--
LOUISS--come into the frame He puts one hand under the cats
head and lifts it so the open eyes now a dull green stare into
THE CAMERA Theres some blood on its ruff Thats all

EXT LOUIS AND JUD ON THE EDGE OF THE CRANDALL LAWN

LOUIS
Its Church

JUD
Im sorry At least it dont look like
he suffered

LOUIS
Ellie will though Shell suffer plenty

From his jacket pocket he takes a green plastic garbage bag and
hands it to JUD JUD holds the bags mouth open on the ground
while LOUIS kind of shoves the body in During this

JUD
Loved that cat pretty well didnt she
LOUIS
Yes

LOUIS twists the bag shut and puts one of those plastic ties on

it Then he holds it up

LOUIS
Bagged cat What a mess

JUD
You going to bury him in the Pet
Sematary

LOUIS (a little bitter)

I guess thats what its there for huh

During all of this JUD has grown peculiarly intense

JUD
Going to tell Ellie

LOUIS
I dont know
JUD
Seems like you told me about a promise

you made--

INT THE CREED KITCHEN MORNING

GAGE is in his high chair ELLIE in her first-day-of-school
dress is in her place LOUIS is sitting at his own place staring

hypnotized at the middle of the table where there
serving dish On the dish is scrambled eggs strips
CHURCHS corpse--staring eyes bloody ruff and all

RACHEL (impatiently)
Dont shilly-shally Louis Give the
little girl her promise

EXT THE CRANDALL LAWN WITH JUD AND LOUIS

LOUIS (defensive)
That was a mistake But Rachel
she doesnt like to talk about
death or even think of it Her
younger sister died of spinal
meningitis when Rachel was eight
Rachel was there when it happened
Alone I guess you could say it
made a complex

is a large
of bacon

and
JUD
Cats just as dead Louis

LOUIS (snaps)
Well thats a big help (Pause) Im
sorry Jud

JUD
No need to apologize

LOUIS
Maybe when they call Ill just tell
Ellie I havent seen the damn cat
around You know

JUD (after a long pause)
Maybe theres a better way

EXT THE START OF THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY LONG EVENING

LOUIS and JUD cross the road from the CRANDALL side LOUIS is
carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the
other JUD has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of
his own in the other

Evening shadows have grown long Its maybe an hour until dark
JUD and LOUIS stop near the replaced tire-swing

EXT LOUIS AND JUD

JUD has a Walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones
slung around his neck

LOUIS
Jud this is crazy Its going to
be almost dark before we get back

JUD
Its going to be dark before we even
get where were going Louis But
we can do itand were going to

LOUIS
But--

JUD
Does she love the cat

LOUIS
Yes but--
JUD
Then come on

He puts the earphones on effectively forestalling further
argument and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman We can hear
Marshall Crenshaw singing Crystal Girl JUD starts away After a
moment LOUIS follows

EXT THE PET SEMATARY AND THE BACK OF THE ARCH LATE EVENING
The SOUND of cricketsree-ree-ree
The SOUND of footfalls

Faintly the SOUND of Huey Lewis and the News singing Working
For A Living

Its now almost twilight

JUD and LOUIS enter the Pet Sematary LOUIS is looking around
curiously

LOUIS
Well folks here we are in Louis
Creed Dreamland

JUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck
again

JUD
What say Louis

LOUIS
Nothing (Pause) Do we plant him on
the outer circle or start a new one

JUD
Were still not where were going

He walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall LOUIS follows

LOUIS
What do you mean

JUD
The place were going is on the
other side of that
He points at the deadfall

LOUIS
We cant climb over that Well break
our necks

JUD
No We wont I have climbed it a time
or two before and I know all the places
to step Just follow memove easydont
look downand dont stop If you stop
youll crash through for sure

LOUIS
Im not climbing that

JUD
Give me the cat Ill take care of it
myself

He holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as
he says After a moment he says

LOUIS
Lets go

JUD starts up one side of the deadfall and in spite of its
snarled tangles he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of
stairs After a few second LOUIS follows

LOUIS (low)
Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up

EXT THEIR FEET

First JUDS pass THE CAMERA then LOUISS partly obscured by the
swinging cat-bag Their feet unerringly find the right branches
and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers
EXT LOUIS

Hes grinning exhilarated

LOUIS
God this is amazing

EXT JUD

There are beads of sweat on the old mans face He looks both
stern and a little scared

JUD
Just dont stop and--

EXT LOUIS
He looks down
EXT LOUISS FEET

A dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot
plunges down maybe six inches

EXT LOUIS
He lurches to the edge of balance then regains it

LOUIS
And dont look down Right

He continues
EXT THE DEADFALL REVERSE TWILIGHT

JUD reaches the top and starts down the far side LOUIS reaches
the top

EXT LOUIS

LOUIS (amazed)
Holy

EXT BIG GOD WOODS LOUISS POV

In the dying glow of twilight this should be a mystic awe-
inspiring shot Theres no more scrub underbrush and junk pines
and juniper-bracken here ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias
The sunset light shafts among them This is a real forest an
old forest And winding upward among the trees along that needle-
carpeted floor clearly marked by large white stones the path
goes on

EXT LOUIS

Hes stopped on top of the deadfall still surveying all this with
frank amazement

EXT JUD

JUD (turns to look)
Come on Louis--dont stop

EXT LOUIS ATOP THE DEADFALL

LOUIS (grinning)
Im all right Im f--

EXT LOUISS FEET
One of the branches snaps LOUISS foot plunges His cuff rips
EXT LOUIS JUDS POV

Were looking up at a fairly steep angle as LOUIS staggers off-
balance He steps with his other foot misses and goes flying

EXT LOUIS CLOSER

He does a half-somersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his
back the green garbage bag flying out of his hand His flashlight
also goes Branches crack White dust puffs out from under him

EXT JUD AT THE BASE OF THE DEADFALL
LOUIS thumps to the ground nearby JUD kneels beside him

JUD
Louis You all right

LOUIS sits up groggily His pants are torn His sweatshirt is
torn His ankle is bleeding

LOUIS (dazed)
Sure I guess I just lost my happy
thoughts for a second there

LOUIS gets slowly up and retrieves the bag which is rather
shredded now--and we can see catfur through some of the rents

LOUIS (continues)
I shouldnt have stoppedand it
does bite

He whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the
light comes on Satisfied he shuts it off

JUD
No you shouldnt have stopped But
you got away with it Important thing
is are you sure youre all right

LOUIS
Yes (Pause) Where are we going Jud

JUD
Youll see before long Lets go

He starts off up the path After a moment LOUIS follows carrying
the bag
EXT LOUIS AND JUD FROM THE DEADFALL

Again there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go
tolling up the path into the twilight dwarfed by those ancient
firs

SOUND OF CRICKETS LOW at first then UP TO LOUD Ree-ree-ree
DISSOLVE TO
EXT LOUIS AND JUD AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP TWILIGHT

Lots of undergrowth here and creeping ground-mist too The SOUND
OF CRICKETS is now only a part of the soundtrack BUZZ OF CICADAS
THUMP OF FROGS Swamp-sounds

LOUIS looks frankly doubtful

JUD
This next bits like the deadfall Louis--
you got to walk steady and easy Just follow
me and dont look down

EXT LITTLE GOD SWAMP LOUISS AND JUDS POV DEEP TWILIGHT

Mysteriousawesomescary Dead trees poke out of the murk like
twisted hands Theres scummy water standing around tussocks
covered with long grass most of it dead Theres a lot of choking
underbrush

All of this fades away into a grim obscuring fog
EXT LOUIS AND JUD

JUD
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp

LOUIS
Is there quicksand

JUD
Ayuh

LOUIS (nervous joking)
Are there ghosts

JUD looks at him expressionlessly

JUD
Ayuh

JUD starts off stepping to the first tussock After a moment
LOUIS follows
EXT JUD CU
His face is set strange

JUD
Theres a lot of funny things down
this way Louis

EXT LOUIS BEHIND JUD

LOUIS
Youre telling me

EXT JUD

JUD (still walking)
The airs heaviermore electrical
something You might see St Elmos
Firewhat the sailors call foo-lights
It makes funny shapes but its nothing

EXT LOUIS
HE looks up and his eyes widen as he sees
EXT ANGLE ON LITTLE GOD SWAMP LOUISS POV

A faintly glowing ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of
the dead trees It looks a bit like a corpse In fact I think it
looks quite a bit like PASCOWS corpse

As we watch it fadesfadesis gone
EXT LOUIS

Hes somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being
scared Now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the
surface of the standing water toward himand then just fades
into the thick mist

LOUIS
Its funny all right

EXT JUD

JUD
Just dont stop Louis You dont
ever want to stop down here in
Little God (Pause) And you dont
ever want to look behind you
whatever you hear
EXT JUD AND LOUIS LONG ANGLE NIGHT

We see them moving through the mist like wraiths JUD with his
digging tools LOUIS with his light and his Hefty-Bag coffin The
whole swamp is glowing dimly

EXT THE FAR SIDE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP NIGHT

In the extreme fg we can see firm ground sloping up Ahead is a
thick white mist And here comes JUD and LOUIS slogging through it
and out of it Both of them are wet from the knees down They head
into the woods on the far side

EXT A LOW STONY BLUFF OR STEEP HILL

In the book this is described as being almost a cliff but a rocky
hill rising out of the woods would serve just as well We can see
steps cut into the side and two figures--LOUIS and JUD--toiling
up them

EXT JUD AND LOUIS A CLOSER SHOT

JUDS panting and out of breath LOUIS is if anything in worse
shape

JUD
Almost there Louis

LOUIS
You keep saying that

JUD
This time I mean it

He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars
the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow A few moments
later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder

EXT THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND LOUIS AND JUDS POV

The top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare but there are a
number of rocky piles But for every pile of rocks we can see
there are ten littered heaps as if the neat piles had been burst
apart Theres a shape to all of this and it is the shape of the
Pet Sematary concentric circles

SOUND The wind blowing ceaselessly

EXT LOUIS AND JUD AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND
LOUIS (awed)
What is this place

JUD
This was their burying ground Louis

LOUIS
Whose burying ground

JUD
The Micmac Indians I brought you here
to bury Ellens cat

LOUIS
Why For Gods sake why

JUD
I had my reasons Louis Well talk later
All right

LOUIS

I guess sobut

JUD
You want to rest a bit before you start

LOUIS
No Im okay Will I really be able to
dig him a grave The soil looks thin

JUD
Soils thin all right But youll manage

He hands him the pick and shovel

JUD
Im going to sit over yonder and have a
smoke Id help you but youve got to
do it yourself Each buries his own
Thats how it was done then

JUD walks away leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand
and the flashlight in the other After a minute LOUIS walks out
into the burying ground

EXT LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE NIGHT

SOUND The wind It blows ceaselessly up here

The holes about two and a half feet deep Stubby rocks protrude

from the sides The pick comes down hits a rock at the bottom
and flashes fire
EXT LOUIS

He drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits

him we see a low pile of rocks and earth

JUD (voice)
Should be deep enough

He joins LOUIS Hes got a lot of rocks in his arms

LOUIS
You think so

He notices the rocks

LOUIS
What are those for

JUD
Your cairn

EXT THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND LOUISS POV
Those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious
EXT LOUIS AND JUD BY CHURCHS GRAVE

LOUIS
Doesnt look like they last long

JUD
Dont worry about that

LOUIS
Jud why am I doing all this

JUD
Because its right

He walks off again
LOUIS looks after him for a moment then kneels down
EXT LOUIS BY THE GARBAGE BAG
He opens it and looks in at CHURCHS stiffening corpse
LOUIS
Pax vobiscum Church old buddy You

were a hell of a god cat I doubt if
you were worth all this aggravation

Beside
but you were a hell of a good cat

He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave and then
begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade

EXT THE CAIRN CU NIGHT

LOUISS hands come into the frame and add a final two or three
stones

EXT LOUIS BY THE CAIRN
He looks at it for a moment and stands up JUD is right there

JUD
Thats fine You did real good

LOUIS looks at him
EXT THE CREED HOUSE NIGHT

Theres a light on in the kitchen but thats all Theres silence
at first and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING

EXT LOUISS FIELD NIGHT

LOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their
lights They are both clearly fagged out

SOUND FAINT The telephone

LOUIS
Oh shit Rachel

He drops the tools and sprints

EXT THE CREEDS SIDE YARD BY THE TIRE SWING

LOUIS runs into the side yard SOUND of the phone is louder
EXT THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE WITH LOUIS

He runs to the door and inside

EXT THE END OF THE PATH WITH JUD

He stands there eyes inscrutable
INT THE LIVING ROOM WITH THE PHONE

It stops A beat later LOUIS enters the room He picks it up
although he already knows its too late He listens to the SOUND
of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle
disgusted

He starts to dial a number from memory

JUD (voice)
Louis

INT THE KITCHENLIVING ROOM DOORWAY WITH JUD

JUD
When you talk to em not one word
about what we done tonight Sfars

you know the cats still fine
INT LOUIS BY THE PHONE
After a moment he lowers it into the cradle
INT JUD

JUD
Youll understand In the meantime
keep your peace What we did Louis
was a secret thing Women are supposed
to be the ones who are good at
keeping secrets but any woman who
knows anything at all would tell you
shes never seen into a mans heart
The soil of a mans heart is stonier
Louis--like the soil up there in the
old Micmac burying ground A man
grows what he canand tends it

During this hes come across the room to LOUIS and dropped his
hand on LOUISS shoulder

LOUIS
But--

JUD
No buts Accept whats done Louis
What we done was right Another time
it might not be but tonight it was
at least I hope to Christ it was Now
you make your callbut not a word
about tonight

EXT THE ROAD WITH JUD

SOUNDS Boops and beeps of a touch-tone telephone Ringing Then
DORY GOLDMAN (voice)
Goldman residence

LOUIS
Hi Doryits Louis--

During this another SOUND has been growing an approaching truck
As JUD gains his side of the road he looks back and we read fear
on his face--no matter what he said to LOUIS hes sorry for
tonights piece of work

A moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between THE CAMERA
and JUD

INT LOUIS IN THE LIVING ROOM NIGHT
Hes on the phone smiling and happy

RACHEL (voice)

crooked in one arm In her lap is a Garfield transistor radio

ELLIE

INT THE CREED LIVING ROOM WITH LOUIS

The smile fades off his face Its replaced with a look of
combined guilt and unhappiness Hes looking at his hands which
are still dark with the dirt from CHURCHS grave

LOUIS
WellI guess hes just fine Ellie
I havent seen him this evening but--

INT THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM WITH ELLIE
RACHEL holding GAGE sits on the arm of ELLIES chair

ELLIE
Well make sure you put him down
cellar before you go to bed so he
cant run out in the road and get
greased And kiss him goodnight for me

LOUIS (voice)
Yuck Kiss your own cat

ELLIE
Want to talk to Gage

Before he can answer she puts the phone in GAGES hand ELLIE and
RACHEL watch amused as GAGE gobbles into it Perhaps RACHEL
encourages him to say a few words

INT THE CREED LVING ROOM WITH LOUIS

From the telephone comes the sound of GAGE talking and chortling
LOUIS is not listening His eyes--and his mind--are far away

EXT THE CREED HOUSE MORNING
LOUIS is raking leaves on the side lawn near the tree with the
tire swing After a moment or two of this he props the rake
against the tree and starts toward the garage He goes in

EXT THE GARAGE WITH LOUIS

Its dim in here LOUIS is crossing to the door which communicates
to the kitchen As he passes the station wagon he hears a cat
HISS He turns

INT CHURCH ECU

Hes on top of the car but at this point we probably dont
notice THE CAMERA is so close that CHURCH looks like hes coming
right down our throats Hes hissing angrily

INT LOUIS

He recoils and stumbles backward with a cry He hits a tool-rack
on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a LOUD JANGLING
NOISE

INT ON TOP OF THE STATION WAGON WITH CHURCH

He jumps down frightened by the noise and the CAMERA TRACKS as
he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight

INT LOUIS
He gets slowly to his feet again Hes getting over his fright but
we can see hes totally freaked out by what gave him that fright

He goes to the garage door and looks out

LOUIS (calls)
Church

EXT THE SIDE YARD LOUISS POV

Grass and fallen leaves No sign of CHURCH

EXT LOUISS STUNNED FACE CU

INT THE KITCHEN WITH LOUIS

Hes spooning cat-food into a dish He goes to the door--there
should be a total of three doors in the kitchen one to the living
room one to the shedgarage and one which leads directly

outside LOUIS uses this latter door now

EXT THE KITCHEN STOOP WITH LOUIS
He puts the dish of food down and sits beside it

LOUIS

SOUND Miaow
EXT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE LOUISS POV

CHURCH comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward
THE CAMERA He stops looking mistrustful

EXT LOUIS

LOUIS
Come on Church Chow down

EXT CHURCH
He crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food

LOUIS (to himself)
Christ I dont believe this

He picks CHURCH up CHURCH miaows again--he wants the food

LOUIS (wincing)
God you stink Church

CHURCH is looking at the food trying to get out of LOUISS arms

LOUIS
In a second

He tilts the cats head back so he can get a look at CHURCHS
neck

EXT CHURCHS NECK CU (LOUISS POV)

Theres some sort of mark here--a clear remnant of the crash A
line of white fur or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all
grows

EXT LOUIS AND CHURCH ON THE STOOP

LOUIS sees something else as he lets the cats neck go He tweezes
something out of CHURCHS whiskers

EXT LOUISS HAND ECU

Its a shred of green plastic
EXT LOUIS AND CHURCH

LOUIS
Chewed his way out Jesus Baldheaded

CHURCH suddenly claws at his face

LOUIS
Ow

He claps his hand to his face CHURCH leaps for the food LOUIS
slowly takes his hand away There are claw marks on his cheek
welling blood He looks at the cat

EXT JUD CRANDALLS GARDEN WITH JUD

The garden is a plot of about half an acre JUD comes trundling
slowly along a row pushing a wheelbarrow There are several
pumpkins in it JUD is wearing old khaki gardening pants anda
Ramones sweatshirt Hes wearing his headphones and we can hear
the Romantics doing What I Like About You JUD is singing along
and bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow if you
can dig it

He sees a real big pumpkin stops and bends over to get it

He takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine He gets
the pumpkin in his arms and stands up He turnsand LOUIS is
right there (kind of a cheap jump but always fun) looking
totally stunned

JUD startled drops the pumpkin LOUIS reaches out and slides the
phones off JUDS ears

LOUIS
What did we do

INT THE CRANDALL KITCHEN

LOUIS is sitting at the kitchen table JUD is at the fridge JUD
comes back with a couple of long-necked bottles of beer and opens
them

JUD
I most generally dont start before
noon but this looks like an exception

LOUIS
What did we do Jud

JUD
Why saved a little girl from being
unhappythats all Drink up Louis

LOUIS drinks about half the beer

LOUIS
I tried to tell myself I buried him
alive You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets
Felix the Cat But

JUD
Wouldnt wash

LOUIS
No Im a doctor I know death when I
see it and Church was dead He smells
horrible and he uses his claws but
hes aliveand I feel like Im going
crazy It was that place wasnt it

JUD
Ayuh It was the rag-man told me about
the place--Stanley Bouchard Us kids
just called him Stanny B He was half
Micmac himself

LOUIS drains his beer

LOUIS
Can I have another one

JUD
I guess it wouldnt hurt

He gets up and goes to the fridge

INT JUD AT

He returns to

THE FRIDGE

JUD
The Micmacs used to bury their dead
up there long before the whites came

the table with the beer

JUD
They buried their dead and for a long
time their dead stayed buried Then
something happened Half the tribe died
in a season The rest moved on They
said a Wendigo had soured the ground

LOUIS
Wendigo

JUD
Spirit of the north country Not a good
spirit Wendigos are great liars and
tricksters according to the stories
And if one touches you

JUD pauses perhaps a flustered and gathers his thoughts

JUD
Maybe it really was a Wendigo--
I aint the one to say it wasnt--
or maybe it was just some disease
Whatever the reason those that were
left moved on But they left that
placethe way it is now

JUD shrugs and drinks
EXT JUD AS A BOY CUSEPIA TONE DAY

The time here is about 1910 JUD is wearing short pants Hes
crying not in any big-deal histrionic way but as if he means to
keep doing it for a long time I mean he looks really sad

JUD (voice)
I loved my dog a lot Louis When Spot
died I thought I was gonna die

JUD is sitting on the front stoop Its the same house JUD lives
in now but the porch hasnt been added yet and the road is dirt
rather than tar

Along this road comes a horse-drawn wagon--STANNY BS wagon The
wagons full of junk rags bottlesstuff to sell and swap
Strung across the top are bells and we can hear their CHIMING
SOUNDbut faint like bells heard in a dream

STANNY B is old and drunk Dust spumes up behind the wagon as he
draws up to the CRANDALL house and stops He gets down almost
falls takes a bottle out of his back pocket drinks and
approaches JUD We can see him speaking

INT JUDS KITCHEN WITH JUD AND LOUIS

LOUIS
You and this old Indian rag-man--

JUD
Stanny B did for me what I did for
you last night Louis Only I wasnt
alone when Spot came back
EXT THE CRANDALL BACK YARDSEPIA TONE DAY

JUDS MOTHER is back to THE CAMERA hanging sheets on the line
The sheets billow And suddenly pushing out from behind them
quite near her is a small mongrel dog SPOT Hes covered with
graveyard dirt His eyes are red and rolling He splashes the
sheets with the muck of his passage

JUD (voice)
My mother was with me

She sees who it is--what it is--and backs away screaming
horrified

EXT SPOT CLOSERSEPIA

Hed got caught in bobwire that infected
You could still see the marks on him
And so we can around his neck and along the side of his head
These marks are the counterpart of the marks weve already seen on

How did your mother take it Jud
How did she take it when your dog
came back from the dead

JUDS face is a complication Hes lying to LOUIS certainly--but
is he also lying to himself Yes I think so

JUD
Well she was a little upset at first
and thats why I thought you ought to
hold your peace when you talked to
your people last nightyou did didnt
you Louis

LOUIS
Yes

JUD
Why then things should be fine

LOUIS
A little upset is all she was Because
Ill tell you Jud my brains feel a
little like a nuclear reactor on the
edge of a meltdown

JUD
She got used to the idea Spot lived
another four years He died peacefully
in the night that second time and I
buried him in the Pet Sematarywhere
his bones still lie

EXT THE ROAD BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES WITH LOUIS AND JUD
We see them crossing

LOUIS (voice)
You still havent told me why you
did it
EXT JUD AND LOUIS ON THE CREED FRONT LAWN
JUD
A man doesnt always know why he does

things Louis I think I did it because
your daughter aint ready for her
favorite pet to die

LOUIS
What

JUD
Ellies a little scared of death And
the main reason Ellies that way is
because your wife is a lot scared of
death Now you just go ahead and tell
me Im wrong

But LOUISS reaction tells him hes not wrong--in fact JUD has
hit the nail right on the head

hands go first to his earphones--his first thought on waking is
that its coming from there--and then he hurries inside
CAMERA PANS DOWN to small muddy tracks on the porch floor
INT THE LIVING ROOM WITH JUD

He hurries in turns on the light and rushes across to his stereo
system which is state-of-the-art digital--it looks like a flying

Come on stop playing games

SOUND Molly Hatchet Flirtin with Disaster being played top
end from upstairs

JUD hurries up Let me suggest that there is a certain psychology
at work here--for the moment hes more concerned about waking the
neighborhood with all this high-decible rock and roll than with
the prowlerand he would certainly know who--or what--that
prowler was if he had time to think

INT JUDS BEDROOM

He enters and turns on the light We see a portable phonograph
with the record turning JUD rushes over and turns it off

pulls

With a startled yell he falls

INT JUD AND GAGE

This ones gotta be pretty rough George will know what to do We
finally see GAGE but it should be clear to us that its not

really GAGE at all Some daemonic presence is riding inside the
mouldering disfigured shell of GAGE
There is a struggle JUD is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel
Perhaps he gets GAGE a time or two with the pocketknife

GAGE screams and gibbers--nothing intelligible here only sounds

He pulls the doctor-bag out His original hope is now tempered
with the first signs of fear He begins to go through the doctor-
bag Suddenly he brings out a case and opens it The case is
empty but the indented shape is clear There was a scalpel in
this casebut not anymore

LOUIS

As IRWIN says this LOUISS eyes fix upon something
INT THE FLOOR WITH TWO SETS OF GAGE-TRACKS LOUISS POV

One set comes in from the shed-garage and heads for the parlor and
upstairs The other comes out of the parlor and crosses to the
kitchen door giving directly on the outside

INT THE KITCHEN WITH LOUIS

In his eyes we suddenly see that he understands everythingor
almost everything

IRWIN (voice)

IRWIN (voice)

But LOUIS whose last few responses have been almost trancelike
hangs up He looks at the tracks then goes into the parlor

INT THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM WITH THE PHONE

Tiny bloody hands lift it off the cradle A tiny bloody finger
dials

INT THE CREED KITCHEN

The phone starts to ring After two or three ringy-dingys LOUIS
looking extremely upset comes out of the parlor and picks it up

LOUIS
Irwin youll just have to--

GAGE (voice)

LOUIS is dumbfoundedslack-mouthed with terror

LOUIS (a bare whisper)
Gage

GAGE (voice)

an awful good time Now I want to play
with you

GAGE begins to gigglea really awful sound

LOUIS
What did you do What did you--

CLICK The GAGE-THING hangs up still giggling

INT THE CREED BED CU
He puts the doctor-bag down on the bed and roots through it He
comes up with three syringes still wrapped in paper and puts
them aside Then he roots around some more and comes up with
several ampoules He holds one up for inspection and we can read
the word MORPHINE on it very clearly

INT THE BEDROOM WITH LOUIS

He carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the
window His hair has gone partially white

He fills all three syringes with morphine (using two ampoules for
each syringe--ie enough to kill a polar bear) and puts them in
the left breast pocket of his shirt He puts the spare ampoules in
the right breast pocket of his shirt

LOUIS is slowly going insane What remains of his rationality is
like a rapidly fraying rope

LOUIS
What you buy is what you own and
sooner or later what you own comes
home to you Wasnt that what you
said Jud Wasnt that pretty much it

He leaves the room

EXT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE

LOUIS comes out the door In one hand hes got a raw pork chop In
the other he is carrying a pair of Playtex rubber gloves He walks
to the soft shoulder and waits for an Orinco truck to pass Then
he crosses

EXT THE CRANDALL WALK WITH LOUIS

He walks most of the way to the house then stops

EXT CHURCH LOUISS POV

He gets up humping his back warily
EXT LOUIS

LOUIS

He finishes with the gloves gets one of the loaded syringes out
of his breast pocket holds it up squirts a drop out of the tip
then moves toward CHURCH

CHURCH looks up LOUIS stops moving CHURCH starts eating again
and LOUIS starts moving again as soon as he does All the time he
talks to the cat in that soothing voice He bends downand grabs
him

CHURCH begins to squall and fight LOUIS holds onto him He tries
to get the syringe into the cat and CHURCH almost gets away

LOUIS
No you dont

EXT CHURCH CU

The syringe plunges into his haunch

EXT CHURCH AND LOUIS

The needle is still dangling out of CHURCHS haunch The cat looks
dazed It tries to walk and falls over on its side It tries to

get upand then falls over again

LOUIS
Go on Lie down Play dead Be dead

He walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag
EXT THE TOTE-BAG LOUISS POV

Any doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is
erased by the initials--RC same as the cola

EXT LOUIS

Twang One of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted
He looks back at

INT UPSTAIRS WITH LOUIS

LOUIS arrives on the landing We begin the nerve-wracking business
of checking rooms First the bathroomand the shower curtain is

of course pulled LOUIS yanks it back Nothing

He checks the linen closet Nothing Goes back to the hall Looks
down it He walks slowly along it He checks one room Its a
guest room Shadowy and empty

Down the hall Now hes at JUDS room He goes in

INT JUDS ROOM WITH LOUIS

He checks the closet No go He steps around the bed and sees
INT THE FLOOR LOUISS POV

A bloodstain

INT LOUIS

He gets down on his hands and knees and examines the bloodstain
He sees the skirt on the bedspread He lifts it He is nose to

nose with JUD who is dead with his eyes open an expression of
incredible horror on his face
The DOOR SLAMS
LOUIS bolts to his feet as GIGGLES fade down the hall

Slowly he kneels down and speaks to the skirt of the spread
which has mercifully fallen back into place

LOUIS
Im sorry Jud Im so sorry Im--

Theres a SQUEAKING SQUEALING SOUND

LOUIS turns around He gets up again He starts for the door Then
he turns back and speaks to JUD again

LOUIS

Im going to set things back in

He goes out
INT THE HALLWAY WITH LOUIS

He takes one of the two remaining loaded syringes from his breast
pocket

LOUIS
Gage

Another SQUEAKING SOUND And another GIGGLE

LOUIS starts slowly forward He gets about halfway down the hall--
and our nerves are tuned to the breaking point--when there is a
SQUEALING CREAK and a GRATING THUMP from overhead

INT CEILING TRAPDOOR

This happens fast The trap--which presumably gives on the attic
with a set of folding stairs--rises and RACHELS body plunges
down through and then hangs swinging she has been bound around
the armpits and as become a grotesque parody of MISSY DANDRIDGE
Half her face is gone Eaten

INT LOUIS

He SCREAMS and backs against the wall Twang The last silver
thread parts

INT THE TRAPDOOR WITH GAGE
He leaps down crashes on the floor and then picks himself up He
is waving the scalpel

GAGE (screeching)
Allee-allee-in-free allee-allee-
in-free Allee-allee-in-free

INT LOUIS AND GAGE

I wont choreograph all the moves but GAGE slashes his stunned
father up pretty badly with the scalpel Hes screeching the whole
time LOUIS finally begins to react He grapples with the little
critter and tries to get the syringe into him No good Its
batted out of his hand just before he can do it It breaks

LOUIS and GAGE fall to the floor LOUIS gets the other syringe out
of his pocket but its also knocked out of his hand Only
consolation is this one isnt broken It rolls off along the
floor LOUIS finally manages to get it again as the struggle goes
on and plunges it into GAGES neck

GAGE
No fair NO FAIR

He gets to his feet clawing for the needle lolling out of his
neck Hes lost all interest in his father He goes staggering

away Hes slowing down He goes to his kneesand falls on his
face

LOUIS watches this and then his vacant half-catatonic gaze
goes to

INT RACHEL LOUISS POV
She swings slowly back and forth
EXT THE BACK YARD OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE

Time has passed Its late afternoon LOUIS comes out with a
sheet-wrapped form in his arms RACHEL of course

He sets the body down and goes back inside

INT THE KITCHEN WITH LOUIS

Hes splashing around a can of coal-oil When hes got the room
wetted down to his satisfaction he goes to the door lights a

match and tosses it

Flame runs across the floor The fire is slow at first but then
it begins to gain rapidly
LOUIS goes out
EXT THE BACK LAWN WITH LOUIS

He picks up the sheet-wrapped form of his wife and walks around
the side of the house as flames shoot through the kitchen windows

EXT THE FRONT OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE FROM ACROSS THE ROAD

LOUIS appears with his shrouded burden and approaches the road
