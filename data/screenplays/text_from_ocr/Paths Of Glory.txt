EXT VARIOUS ANGLES - STAFF CAR - DAY

Drenched in the dazzling clear sunlight of a Spring day
and gleaming black staff-car winds its way along the back
roads of the rolling French countryside An old grizzled
farmer looks up from plowing A child waves froma
broken porch swing A redcheeked pregnant peasant
girl idly watches the car pass nearby

EXT ELEGANT COUNTRY ESTATE - DAY

The headquarters of GENERAL ROUSSEAU It is a lovely
gracious place surrounded by well-kept tall hedges
graceful willow trees and a sloping grassy lawn of
enormous Sweep The staff-car swerves up the winding
gravel drive leading to the entrance Everywhere in
evidence is the restrained bustle connected with a
military headquarters Smrtily uniformed ‘guards small
Groups of officers arriving and departing dispatch
riders conversing with each other in hushed tones

Waiting for the staff-car are GENERAL ROUSSEAUS two
aides MAJORS SAINT-AUBAN and COUDERC They politely
greet the occupants of the car ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL

INT PLUSH SALON DAY 3

Which has been converted into GENERAL ROUSSEAUS office
There are maps everywhere on the wall spread on the
table folded on chairs and stacked on shelves The
room is richly furnished 1n Louis XV with thick carpets
fine paintings and everywhere graced with art objects

of all kinds GENERAL BROULARD wanders about the room
admiringly GENERAL ROUSSEAU packs his pipe thought -
fully He is a friendly looking man in his fifties
Somewhat of a cat and mouse game appears to be in
progress

GEN BROULARD
Paul youve done a wonderful
job on this room

GEN ROUSSEAU
Youre very kind George but
its really pretty much the way
I found it when the Blanchards
evacuated the place I may have
added touch here and there but
nothing really important

( - 1)

GEN BROULARD
Well Paul say what you will
but bd prefer to believe that
your taste in carpets and pic
tures is second to none

GEN ROUSSEAU

(playing the game)
Thank you -- I do think its
d4mportant -- I mean the place
a man works the way it looks
The atmosphere of the room has
an effect on the man who works
in it

GENERAL BROULARD scrutinizes an elegant vase resting on
and marble table top Smiling to himself he looks up
brightly and crosses the room to GENERAL ROUSSEAUS
desk seating himself comfortably in a leather chair

GEN BROUIARD

(complete change

of tone)
Paul Ive come to see you about
something big Its top secret
and it mustnt go further than
your chief of staff and not to
him unless you can trust his
discretion

GEN ROUSSEAU
Of course

GEN BROULARD
A group of armies is forming on
this front for an offensive in
about three weeks Joffre is
determined to make a complete
breakthrough The latest word
seems to be that the Americans
are not coming into the war
Apparently they dont seem to
mind having their ships torpedoed
So it looks as though we wont be
getting any help at least not
very soon anyway Why are you
smiling

GEN ROUSSEAU
Oh forgive me go on please

( - 2)

GEN BROULARD
No really I know its silly
but I wish youd tell me what
you Were smiling at

GEN ROUSSEAU
Im realiy sorry I didnt mean
to be rude I just thought for
a moment that I knew what you
were about to say Please go
ONe

GEN BROULARD
(pleasantly)
I never knew you were a mind
reader -- what did you think I
was about to say

GEN ROUSSEAU
(tentatively)
Something about the Ant Hi11

GEN BROULARD
You re a mind reader Paul

GEN ROUSSEAU
Not really It is a key position
Its in my sector -- and further-
more to be perfectly honest Ive
heard some talk You mow nothings
really a secret at headquarters

GENERAL BROULARD studies GENERAL ROUSSEAU for a moment
then he smiles pleasantly

GEN BROULARD
Well what do you think

GEN ROUSSEAU
About what

GEN BROULARD
About the Ant Hi11

GEN ROUSSEAU
I suppose just about the same
sort of things that everyone
else thinks about it Its
the key to the whole Germain
position in this sector
(continued)

( - 3)

ROUSSEAU smiles at him politely
smile and turns his attention to an ivory letter-opener

GEN ROUSSEAU (contd)
Thats not news to anyone Im
sure Its a miniature
Gibralter The Germans have
held onto it for over a year
And I dare say that they know
what its worth too Theyve
put a lot of work into seeing
that we dont take it away
from then

GEN BROULARD
(solemnly)
I saw Joffre yesterday He gave
me formAl orders to take the
Ant Hill no later than the tenth
Thats day after tomorrow

( GEN ROUSSEAU )
smiles patronizingly

I dont want torbe disrespestful
to the old boy but that kind of
I want it no later than the
tenth stuff comes very close
to being ridiculous dont you
think

GEN BROULARD
(disappointed)
I dont imagine Id here if
I really thought that Look
Paul we all know its not
going to be a picnic - but
then no one ever said it would

GEN BROULARD

Ive entrusted this job to Sorel
and Swann already and theyve
failed both times If theres
One man in this army who can do
this for me its you Paul Id
have called on you first but you
were up to your neck at Souchez

GEN ROUSSEAU
Youre very flattering George
but really its out of the
question -- absolutely out of
(continued)

BROULARD returns the

GEN ROUSSEAU (contd)
the question My division was
cut to pleces Whats left of
it 18 in no condition to even
hold the Ant Hill let alone
take it Im sorry but thats
the truth at least in ny
opinion

BROULARD gets out of his chair and walks to the window
He picks at a fleck of paint on the glass

GEN BROULARD
Im sorry to hear you talk this
way What I mean is that as
your friend -- I shouldnt want
to see anything like this no
matter how genuine it might be --

GEN ROUSSEAU
(pleasantly)
What are you trying to say
George

GEN BROULARD
Well lets be honest with each
other We always have been and
theres no reason why we should
start doing things any differently
now Youve got a right to know
or permaps I should say as a
friend I have a right to tell you

BROULARD faces around His eyes fairly sparkle

GEN BROULARD
The talk about headquarters is
that youre being considered
for the twelfth corps - and
with that another star Now
We both know that youve got a
good enough record to be able to
refuse this order on the grounds
youve stated No one would ques-
tion your decision and theyd get
someone else to do the job But
then you know the way talk starts
about a thing like that Of course
its always by those rear echelon
commandos who wet their pants when
oar backfires -- but theyve got
mouths and theyve got dirty
gossipy minds

( - 5)
ROUSSEAU smoothes back his hair nervously He moves to

and small bar

GEN ROUSSEAU
Would you like some cognac

GEN BROULARD
No thanks I try not to etart
before dinner In fact the
doctors have been trying to get
me to lay off the stuff com-
pletely

ROUSSEAU pours himself a brandy replacing the cap of the
bottle with great precision He drains the snifter
Slowly He looks at BROULARD with an idle expression
that seems to say All right lets suppose I am
interested whats the next move

GEN ROUSSEAU
Youre awfully clever George
But then you always have been

ng

But not omatin enough apparently
A little transparent there at the
end I was confident your judge-
ment wouldnt be swayed by an
andppeal to your ambition no mtter
how valid it might be But you
cant blame me for trying Frankly
Id have been disappointed if you
hadnt seen right through m

GEN ROUSSEAU

(solemly)
Well I dont think I have to be
ashamed of the fact that I have
normal amount of ambition --
and that naturally Im concerned
about my reputation at headquarters
but there are other considerations
I am responsible for the lives of
elght thousand men

GEN BROULARD
(mows Rousseau is
hooked )
Of course you are And I know you
wouldnt tackle a thing unless you
were sure that you were doing right
(continued )

-8-

( 6)

GEN BROULARD (contd)
by those men Now look - just
Suppose for the moment that you
Were convinced at least to the
point of your conscience being
clear Now if for some unlooked
for reason the thing didnt come
off right -- well at least you
gave it your all The casualties
will prove that You did the
best you could Perhaps your
division was under strength
Perhaps if was tired Its morale
was low Perhaps in retrospect
it might appear they were not
really in the best shape to carry
the assault But it wasnt your
idea You simply did your best
to carry out orders And further-
more although I lmow this is of
secondary interest to you I mst
take the risk of angering you by
pointing out that this would not
hurt your chances for the twelfth
corps In fact it would probably
help them

ROUSSEAU lights up a cigar first carefully snipping one
end with a cutter

GEN ROUSSEAU
Hows artillery

GEN BROULARD
All you want

ROUSSEAU savors his cigar

GEN ROUSSEAU
How about replacements

GEN BROULARD
(hopefully)
Well see what we can do

GEN ROUSSEAU
When do you see this coming off

GEN BROULARD
No later than day after tomorrow

( - 7)

ROUSSEAU lazily reaches across his cluttered desk for
the telephone

GEN ROUSSEAU

(into phone)
Ask Major Saint-Auban to come
in please Just second --

(covers mouthpiece )
Whats the name of your Colonel

GEN BROULARD
de Guerville

GEN ROUSSEAU
Ask Colonel de Guerville to
come in too

EXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY VARIOUS ANGLES

Establishing the 1¥1st Regiment dispiritedly slogging
back to the trenches They are loaded down like pack
animals Their uniforms look as though they had been
marinated in mud The sky in the direction they are
marching 1s occasionally illuminated by a dim flash of
light followea a split second later by a dull boom

The tramp of their feet 1s out of step and this is
accentuated by the irregular clanking and banging of
their equipment There are ideally about one
thousand men winding along the road in columns of fours

THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN COLONEL DAX AND CAPTAIN
RENOUART

COLONEL DAX is a handsome min in his thirties - vigor-
ous and tanned by the weather CAPTAIN RENOUART is a
young man in his late twenties graced by the kind of
good looks that would go into mking a beautiful womn -
an elegantly trimmed moustache completes his face

The two men walk little apart from the rest and talk
in hushed tones They have been talking before we come
upon them COLONEL is noticeably annoyed They
speak in low tones s0 as not to be overheard

( )

( 1)

COL DAX

Do you know your real trouble
Captain Renouart Youre ego-
tistical Youve got a big head
Youre so sure the sun rises and
sets up there in your noggin you
dont even bother to carry matches
Now let me ask you one question
And believe me Im entirely serious
about it Do you think youre God

( CAPT RENOUART
id
Of course I dont Colonel

COL DAX
Youre not infallible then
Youre every bit as apt to be
wrong 88 any other human being

CAPT RENOUART

(firmly
Im not wrong about the Ant Hill
Anyone with a brain in his head
would know that -«

COL DAX
And youve got the only brain in
the world They made yours and
threw the pattern away The rest
of us have a skullful of corn-
flakes

CAPT RENOUART
Look I know I dont have that
wonderful legal mind of yours
You can twist everything --

COL DAX
All right you say its impossible
The best military minds in France
think its possible but you dont
Both times other outfits have been
cut to pleces Now were given the
job Were under strength and
were battle weary It makes no
sense at all

CAPT RENOUART
Right

-11-

COL DAX
But what conclusion can we
justifiably draw from all of
that Difficult -- yes
Small chance for success --
yes Possibility of great
casualties - yes No apparent
reason clear to us yes
Conclusion Not very pleasant
to look forward to but definitely
not impossible If we never fight
unless were absolutely sure of --

CAPT RENOUART
Now youre putting words in my
mouth And furthermore youre
reducing it all to an absurdity
Look beyond your wonderful
orystal clear logic theres a
thing called common sense And
that common sense understanding
of the situation says in big bold
letters impossible senseless
willful murder

COL DAX
How do you mean impossible
Like € dead man walking a
guy with a bullet through his
heart Something like that

CAPT RENOUART

(warily)
Yes

COL DAX
I knew a man to do exactly that
He had a hole in his ticker you
couldnt cork with a cornoob but
he walked almost three miles
I proved that he did and estab-
lished that his wife couldnt have
been near the place he was shot
You see the trouble with common
sense is that things are often not
what they seem to be

CAPTAIN RENOUART shrugs and walks along silently DAX
regards RENOUART uncomfortably

your shoulders Youd

now Act like a min Live up to
those captains bars youre wear-
ing You do it or Ill take em
off of you Il nail your tail
to a stump and push you off back-

wards

CAPTAIN RENOUART smiles ruefully

IN THE COLUMN - MEYER AND FEROL

The only similarity between the two men is their rank of

private MEYER is a tall bushy-hai
uneven features who by some might

red man with bizaare
be considered ugly

FEROL is a slender somewhat Go00d-looking if ferret-

ZI think you just lost your license

Explosive laughter from all sides CAPPAIN SANCY scowls

ANOTHER PART OF THE COLUMN ARNAUD AND DUVAL

We hear the laughter of the previous scene in the dis
tance ARNAUD is a tall wiry wan with steel-rimmed
glasses DUVAL is a plump friendly looking fellow
From the way they treat each other we gather they are
very good friends The two men talk quietly but the
soldiers on each side of them cannot help overhearing
the conversation with the result that they wear a
studied look of inattention

Pvt ARNAUD

reading a letter)
Just a few lines my darling to
tell you that I shall not be
going up to the front for a week
or more We have just reached a
rest area s0 you dont have to
worry about me at all I have a
conviction

(voloe trails off)
Well the rest is just personal

PVT DUVAL
You should have miled it back
in the rest area

PvT ARNAUD
When the order to move out came
I was so completely surprised I
forgot about the letter

Pvt DUVAL
If you get a chance you should
send it anyway It will make her
just as happy as if it were true

PvT ARNAUD
Yes I suppose so

The two walk in gloomy silence

PyT ARNAUD
(as if telling a
secret)
Ive got a bad feeling this time
I can feel it coming

PVT DUVAL
Dont talk that way youll put
a jinx on yourself

Pvt ARNAUD
I cant help it Its been two
years -- two years without a
scratch without even getting
Sick How long can your luck

hold out

PVT DUVAL
It can hold out as long as it
has to

PVT ARNAUD

If you keep flipping a coin and
it keeps coming up heads time
after time youve got to expect
a tail

PVT DUVAL
Thats not entirely true though
They say its fifty-fifty on each
flip no matter how many times it
comes up head or tail If you
flipped a hundred heads in a row
the odds of getting head on the
hundred and first flip would still
be fifty-fifty

PvT ARNAUD
That may be true theoretically
but if I saw someone flip even
six heads in 4 row Id bet tails
on the seventh They say its
fifty-fifty but somehow it doesnt
seem to work out that way

LONG SHOT - THE REGIMENT

The slow moving clanking colum winds through the
deepening gloom of oncoming night like some monstrous
snake A muffled boom-boom-boom punctuates the hushed
night air

SLOW DISSOLVE

VIEW OF THE NIGHT SKY

The horizon line flickers intermittently Each flicker
is followed now by a louder and more richly defined
boom We are not far from the front

VARIOUS ANGLES OF THE REGIMENT

The sides of the road are littered with the grim residue
of war The ground is churned up like a lumpy pudding
Here and there we can see silhouetted against the
flickering black sky the remains of a splintered tree
The men re silent They are hunched forward with
fatigue Some men are shivering their frosty breaths
testifying to the coldness of the night

THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN COLONEL DAX

He walks with small group of officers -- his ADC
CAPIAIN HERBILLION CAPTAIN RENOUART MAJOR VIGNON
and a few others

not the easiest thing in the world to do

INT LT ROGETS DUGOUT NIGHT 10

LIEUTENANT ROGET who we have seen briefly on the march
into the trenches is a balding puffy min sporting a
thin mustache He is in his middle thirties and he has
the kind of face you take an immediate dislike to with-
out even pausing for a moments reflection that first
impressions are not always correct

He sits before a battered wooden table The dugout is
literally dug out of the earth itself reinforced by
rough-hewn wooden beams and logs A crude bed of straw
packed into wooden mold is the only Sign of comfort

LIEUTENANT ROGET is drinking and from his heavy move-
ments we miy assume he has not just begun His face is
cork-blacked and he is in full battle dress but for his
helmet which rests on the table beside him He takes
several swallows from a bottle of cognac which is almost
empty There is a candle jammed ina bottle The flame
flickers in a draft ROGET looks up

CORPORAL PARIS and PRIVATE LEJEUNE enter We have seen
them briefly on the march too PARIS is a good-looking
Well-built man LEJEUNE is a chunky solid-looking man
They are in battle dress and have their faces blacked
They snap to attention before LIEUTENANT ROGET He re-
gards them stonily and makes a visible effort to pull
himself together He succeeds to the extent of being
able to reproduce a ponderous air of solemnity

(sobered considerably)
Thank you Captain Everything
is clear and understood And
you men keep your fingers off
that coffee grinder till we get
out of the way All tight come
on

VARIOUS ANGLES

With ROGET in the lead they stealthily crawl over the
parapet The clouds have broken and now the moon is

full The broken contours of the ground stand out in
grotesque relief Bending low they swiftly enter the

Opening in the wire All three carry revolvers and extra

grenades They crawl painstakingly through the lane
Suddenly their path is blocked by more wire The night
is very quiet All their movements seem to mike an ine
ordinate amount of noise

nearby shellhole

Standing in the shell-hole he checks his position
Suddenly he jumps Grimly etched by the moonlight two
men seem to be asleep ROGET and LEJUENE slide over the
vim of the crater

Who are those two

CPL PARIS

Not that way Lieutenant Youll

PARIS exchanges a worried glance with LEJUENE

LT ROGET
Well those two are

He giggles at his own joke

CPL PARIS
And well be joining them if we
keep making this much noise

ROGET nods his head Solemnly Then he realizes the insult
He is quite drunk

LP ROGET crawls over the lip of the shell-hole PARIS
and LEJUENE follow The silence is broken by a distant
brief exchange of smAll arms fire ROGET increases his

speed increasing the noise of the patrol

In the almost

perfect silence of the night the noise they are making
is terrific PARIS grabs ROGET by the ankle and crawis

up longside him
CPL PARIS

the moonlit sky ROGET belches loudly Instantly a
flare arcs up It bursts overhead and slowly descends
Everything is bathed in a blinding brilliance The
patrol freezes against the broken mounds of earth A
machine gun trips a short burst The flare dies re-
storing the night

The men slowly raise their heads PARIS and LEJUENE
exchange another worried glance ROGET moves off again
along the Germin wire There are many corpses around
them ROGET stops His head sags PARIS crawls along-

PARIS fires at ROGET but misses

A blinding explosion A shriek JIEJUENE calls Paris

First general insubordination

superior officer Thats mutiny
number one Third refusing to
obey an order and inciting others
to do the same Thats mitiny
number two and three Fourth
firing at your superior officer
Thats attempted murder and mutiny
number four How do you suppose
those charges will look on paper

CPL PARIS
Well since you mention it Id
say they wouldnt look half as
good as these Drunk on duty
Endangering the lives of your men
through drunken recklessness
Refusal to take counsel Wanton
murder of one of your own men
Gross incompetence in general and
finally Lieutenant cowardice in
the face of the enemy

Silent for a moment ROGET smiles

mars the otherwise quiét air Led by CAPTAIN HERBILLION
GENERAL ROUSSEAU and his ADC MAJOR SAINI-AUBAN stride
into view around a traverse Moving at a smart clip
they pass troops who stare sheepishly at ROUSSEAU He
appears to be well liked by the men and returns cordial
nods to miny of them Now and then he stops for a brief
exchange of words very much enjoying the admiring
giances of onlookers the whole affair having much of the
quality of a political candidate seeking favor among his

GEN ROUSSEAU

(4dly adjusts belt)
Well now - uh - very regret-
table at any rate Very Yes
indeed But you know along
those lines Ive had an idea
recently that I think might be
very useful -- Ive been wonder
ing gentlemen Do you suppose
it would be of any value if after
an attack a detail went out and
mapped the casualties That is to
say the dead form an axiomtic
pattern of the enemy fire the flow
of battle and our own mistakes
Now if we could map them show just
where they were killed and in what
numbers

MAJ SAINI-AUBAN
An excellent idea sir It would
certainly allow us to profit by
our experience General Im
going to insist that you submit
this idea to the General staff

GEN ROUSSEAU
(modestly

Oh well the General Staff TI
dont mean to be derogatory
naturally But by the time they
got around to considering ite-
merely an idea for saving lives
What do you think of it Dax

COL DAX

(uncomfortably)
I -- think its an interesting
idea sir If it has a flaw it
may lie in the direction that the
circumstances of battle are rarely
identical -- and the lesson of one
day may be of very limited value
on another

( )

( - 3) 16-B

MAJ SAINT-AUBAN
icily)
That of course is merely the
Colonels off hand opinion

COL DAX
On the contrary Major If you
are interested there is a com-
plete analysis of the idea written
by Von Borke in 1830

MAJ SAINT-AUBAN
Is the Colonel implying that
Generel Rousseau has borrowed
this idea from a textbook

GEN ROUSSEAU
Gentlemen gentlemen please
I am certain the Colonel meant
no offense

COL DAX
My apologies General TI most
certainly aid not mean any
offense

Oh Dax thats laying it on 4
bit thick isnt 1t

COL DAX
I dont think s0

GEN ROUSSEAU

(very kind and gentle)
Naturally men are going to have
to be killed possibly a lot of
them They absorb bullets and
shrapnel and by doing s0 make it
possible for others to get through
Say five percent killed by their
own barrage and thats a ve
generous allowance Ten percen
more in crossing no-mins-land and
twenty percent getting through the
wire That leaves sixty-five per-
cent with the worst part of the job
over Lets say another twenty-
five percent in actually taking the
Ante-Hill were still left with a
force more than adequate to hold it

anticipating that more than half

Appearing almost to be a museum it is so full of lavish
furnishings tapestries and art objects COLONEL DAX
GENERAL BROULABD and GENERAL ROUSSEAU are found in the

midst of a heated discussion

( - 1)

GEN ROUSSEAU
ZI ordered an attack and your
troops refused to attack In
my book thats mutiny

COL DAX
My troops did attack sir But
they could mike no headway

GEN ROUSSEAU
Because they didnt ¢t Colonel
I saw it myself from OP
Three quarters of the regiment
never even left the trenchea

COL DAX
Two thirds of the regiment was
in support not even in the
front lines

GEN ROUSSEAU
I mean battalion of course dont
quibble over words I do not in-
tend to be moved from my position
Im going to have a section from
each company tried under penalty
of death for mutiny and cowardice --
and I repeat it was mutiny Mutiny
and cowardice Refusal to obey an
order Theyre scum dyou hear me
e the whole rotten regiment
A pack of sneaking whining taile
dragging curs Theyve got skin-
milk in their veins instead of
blood

COL DAX
Then its the reddest milk Ive
ever seen My trenches are soaked
with that red skim-milk

GEN ROUSSEAU
They were ordered to attack and
they refused If that --

COL DAX
There was no question of refusing
Failure to do the impossible
doesnt imply unwillingness to do
it You do see that dont you
General Suppose you were ordered
to take Berlin by tomorrow morning

“7T2-

( - 2)

GEN ASSOLANT
(statriy

If I were ordered to take Berlin
I would take it or die in the
attempt

- DOL DAX
(quickly)
Seeing that youre still alive
then I gather that you were not
ordered to take the Ant Hill
order originated with you

GEN ROUSSEAU
With me What do you « Colonel
Dax youre being impertinent

COL DAX
I was simply pursuing question
General

GEN ROUSSEAU

You already know the answer You
lmow the order came from the
General Staff

COL DAX
Why General

GEN ROUSSEAU
Why What do you mean

COL DAX

Yes why You were right here on
the grounds Youd been within
striking distance of the Ant Hill
for weeks If it was possible to
take it why hadnt you done so -
as you had in the case of so many
other objectives Why did you wait
for an order from the General Staff

GEN BROULARD
(clearing throat)
I believe were straying from the
point gentlemen The issue here
as I see it is simply -

-73-
( - 3)

COL DAX

(cutting him off)
The issue here is whether my
regiment 1s to be condenmed to
cover up what might be called
by someone less kind than myself
an idiotic error in judgment
General Rousseau didnt attack the
Ant Hill on his own initiative be-
cause he imew what the General
Staff should have known and doubt
less did lmow but was unwilling to
admit That any attack with the
forces at our disposal was doomed
to failure

GEN ROUSSEAU
Colonel Colonel Dax I am going
to overlook your outrageous be-
havior for the moment Right now «

COL DAX
General I think the question of
my So-called outrageous behavior
had better be settled immediately
My regiment is under the shadow
of two serious and shameful crimes
I know they are not guilty of
either I intend to do everything
I can to establish their innocence --
or do nothing at all If Im to be
forced to mince words to stand on
protocol and procedure at every
point to neglect the lives and honor
of my men to neglect them those
things so that the touchy dignity
and tender feelings of biunderers
may be protected -

GEN ROUSSEAU
Colonel Dax

COL DAX
-- then I will not be a party to
this hearing I wont assist in
the pretense that its anything
but a mockery and an attempt to
distort and conceal the truth
rather than reveal it

BROULARD regards DAX through narrowed eyes an intrigued
reluctantly amused look on his face

( - 4)

GEN ROUSSEAU
Are you quite through Colonel
All right Now I am --

GEN BROULARD
(gesturing casually)
A word General

GEN ROUSSEAU
WellCertainly General

GEN BROULARD
I believe the Colonel has a point
ss ceven though he mikes it rather

biun
tomiles pleasantly
at Dax

This isnt a trial but 1t does
bear certain aspects of one Amd
Colonel Dax technically is cast
in the role of the defense Under
the circumstances and in view of
the seriousness of the oharges

and court of law would allow him extra-
ordinary consideration Within the
bounds of propriety he would be
given all possible latitude in pre-
senting his case

ROUSSEAU stares blankly out the window

GEN BROULARD
Im merely offering an opinion
General Please dont feel con-
strained to accept it

GEN ROUSSEAU
Im very happy to accept itYou
may proceed Dax

COL DAX

Guerville )
General what 1s your position at
this hearing

GEN BROULARD
What is my Im not sure I
understand you Colonel

-T5-

( - 5)

COL DAX
I mean why are you here In
fhat capacity do you appear
Teo

GEN BROULARD
Im not at all surem afraid
that might not be a pertinent
question Colonel In fact it
would seem to veer toward the
opposite

COL DAX
It seems right on target to me
General But of course if
youd rather not answer

GEN « BROULARD

laughs
Youll put the worst possible mis-
interpretation on it I can under
stand yow success as an attorney
ColonelBut getting to your ques-
tion « of course I dont mind
answering it Im here to represent
the Generel Staff

COL DAX
What are your functions as their
representative To advise observe
or just what

GEN BROULARD
hesitates )
Wellits rather difficult to
catagorize Colonel Perhaps if
zmmew the reason for your ques
ONece

COL DAX
ZI dont see how that would affect
your position It would be exactly
the same it seems to me regardless
of iy reason for being interested
in it

( Peay) ROuARD
brightly

Mmm yeS 80 it would wouldnt
it Youre quite right Colonel

-76

( - 6)

COL DAX
Well Youve made suggestions
given advice a time or two
Are you here as the staffs ad-
visor to General Rousseau

GEN BROULARD
No00 Not exactly Colonel In
sense perhaps yes but on the
other hand no

COL DAX
I wonder if we cant pin that
down a little tighter General
I have nothing against yes and
no answers you understand but
I find them somewhat confusing in
combination Now would it be
fair to say that you were present
more or less as amicus curae A
friend of the court that is using
the term court to include all parties
to the controversy

GEN BROUIARD
pure 8 lips thought-
piiy)
Now I think that would come very
close to it Colonel Amicus
Curae yes I believe’ that exactly
describes my position

COL DAX
Then youre absolutely impartial
The General Staff positively has -
no interest in this matter except
to see that justice is done

GEN BROULARD
Thats correct

COL DAX
And youre certainly not interested
in digging up scapegoats for the
staffs mistakes

GEN BROULARD
(laughing)
Colonel really That sounds like
one of those still-beating-your-
wife queries But no certainly
not We are not looking for scape-
goats

-77

( - 7)

COL DAX
Actually having complete con«
fidence fn General Rousseau s
good jugment and integrity your
part in this inquiry is a sub
stantially passive one Any
decisions that are made will be
his and his entirely

GEN BROULARD
Of course

COL DAX
And just as you take no direct
part in making those decisions
you will assume no responsibility
for them

GEN BROULARD
chuckies turns to
ousseau)

Dont deny it General -- youve
been hiding this man Keeping
him for your own eh I think
that was very selfish of you
Now lets see0h yes I be
lieve you were saying when I
interrupted you Colonel Some
thing rather nasty as I recall
Would you like to go on with 1t

COL DAX

(shrugs )
Why bother Lets lay it on the
line The staff is looking for
sacrificial goats but its too
squeamish not to mention
cautious -- to do its own slaughter-
ing Therefore General Rousseau
Hes been forced to compromise him-
self His vanity is wounded He --

GEN ROUSSEAU
(explosively)
Now this is too much This —
this kind of talk definitely is
not within the boundaries of
propriety

(CONFINUED)

-78-

( - 8)

GEN BROULARD
General I think we must try to
bear in mind that Colonel Daxs
exceedingly painful position is
not an unnatural habitat for paine
ful words You Colonel I want
you to keep Gemeral Rousseaus
positia in mind his official
position and the great dignity
adhering thereto

COL DAX
In view of your admonition
General I think Id better
preface it with a few words
Briefly I sincerely believe in
what I am saying and it is said
with no intent to give hurt to
you or General Rousseau

GEN BROUIARD
(smiles
That sounds rather ominous Colonel
I think Il withhold absolution
temporarily
nods
Please proceed

COL DAX
Well

(hesitates )
General I dont quite know how
I mean in view of your courtesy
its difficult to -- to

GEN BROULARD

(amiably
Oh go Shead Colonel Go ahead
Take one glove off Loosen the
cork in the poison bottle Bea
little nasty if you have to
After all if you have an ine
trinsically nasty situation

(shrugs )

COL DAX
(brusquely)
I was saying the staff pulled a
bonehead By dishing out punish-
ment for its error it hopes to
(continued)

-79-

( - 9) 27

COL DAX (contd)
esoape responsibility -- to give
the impression that the Ant Hill
could have been taken if my men
had done their duty The staff
wants no part of the job itself
Its too good for such dirty work
- cant officially admit its
existence Also its too smart
Also with General Rousseau so
conveniently eager it doesnt
need to do it It needs to do
nothing but let him carry the
ball and keep out of hisway while
he runs for the goal If he makes
it fine the steff has won If
he fumbles if there are reper-
oussions thats still all right
The staff 18 no worse off than it
was before It has taken no part
in the game and the penalty is
strictly General Rousseaus

DAX stops speaking BROULARD waits to mke sure that he 1s
through Then smiling pleasantly he turns to ROUSSEAU
The General is frowning slightly not fully understanding
what he has heard not believing what he has understood but
just a little worried nonetheless

GEN BROULARD
Well General What do you say
to that

GEN ROUSSEAU
(smiling uncertainly)
Well uh Im -- I dmt see that
any comment is called for Wouldnt
care to dignify it with a comment

GEN BROULARD
(1nelining head
Thank you for your confidence
General Now -- Yes Dax

CQ DAX
Id like to ask a question General
- one that youve evaded thus
far Is the General Staff taking
official cognizance of these pro-
ceedings which may evolve from
these

( )
80-

( 10)

GEN BROULARD
(spreads hands smiling)
The answer would seem obvious
Colonel I believe Im here
am I not

COL DAX
You can be here physically with
out being here officially hat
and§ ——

GEN BROULARD
Or de facto but no de pure to
use your latin legalistics Yes
so I could

COL DAX
Well

GEN BROUIARD

(becoming slightly

annoyed)
I believe Ive made my position
here completely clear Colonel
Ive explained it not once but
several times Wait «

(holds up hand)
If it appears to need further
clarification I will be glad to
supply itbut not to you Colonel
I just dont see that its any of
your business you know Its a
mtter purely between General
Rousseau and me or I should say
the General Staff Any questions
or answers on the subject will be
kept within those brackets

GEN ROUSSEAU

Colonel Dax you have made certain
statements and insinuations about
the offices of the General Staff
which paints an extremely ugly
picture Do you really have that
mental picture of the men who guide
our armies «-- who hold the destiny
of France her welfare and her honor
in their hands Do you actually
see them as biockheads and blunderers
petty little men who would willfully
throw away the lives of our soldiers

(continued)

-41-

( 11)

GEN ROUSSEAU (contd)
to enhance their own position
I cant believe that you do
Colonel I refuse to believe
that you do

COL DAX

(unc omf ortably)
Wellperhaps my language was
too strong General Much too
atrong Im more than willing to
believe that the General Star
acted in good faith and that it
felt confident the attack would
succeed But -

GEN BROULARD
And it was right Colonel It
was absolutely right

COL DAX
(laughs incredulously)
Right Right After what happened
yesterday you can tell me that --

GEN BROULARD

(quiet
What else can I tell you That
the men which France must live
or die by are not to be trusted
That we can have no faith in them
That they are as likely to be
wrong as right You know better
than that Colonel Youre an
intelligent man In general
awkward as it may be at the
moment your feelings - your
philosophy - must closely
parallel mine

COL DAX —

(hesitates laughs

shortly)

Lets say it did General Lets
just say thatit did

(he sighs shakily)
Gentlemen if its an example you
want one man will do as well as a
hundred But I wouldnt know how
to choose him TI would have to
offer myself - after all Im the
responsible officer

-82-

GEN BROULARD
Oh come now Colonel I think
youre overwrought It isnt
a question of officers
to ROUSSEAU in a
ese0h come on lets
settle this thing”
tone of voice)
Suppose we mike it a dozen We
wont say it was mutiny It would
be just as well I think to keep that
ugly word out of it Just cowardice
in the face of the enemy

( GEN ROUSSEAU

peeved
I was talking about four sections
and here we are down to one squad
already

COL DAX
I implore you gentlemen A dozen
men A dozen men like a dozen head
of cattle Its monstrous Either
the whole battalion is guilty or
Iam alone But think of our
record Of what wed just been
through at Spuchez Of the condi-
tion of the men Of the rain Amd
of the murderous Boche fire
These m were not --

“Gentes occurs to

If you take twelve men how will they
be selected

GEN ROUSSEAU
itth leave that entirely to you
Xe

COL DAX
If I were to ask each company
commnder to select three men
would that suit you

GEN ROUSSEAU
That would seem to

COL DAX
And how shall you know who these
people are Where they come from
What connections they may have

COL DAX (conta)
(Dax thinks he -has
really struck gold)
What reverberations may be stirred
up

GEN BROULARD
(matter of factly)
You have a point there Colonel

A painful Bilence hangs over the voom Outside a bird
sings

GEN ROUSSEAU

(very self-righteous )
All right youve made your point
Perhaps I was a bit too anxious to
see the proper justice meted out
Ive spent my whole life in the
Army and Ive always tried to be
true to my principals Thats the
only mistake I can ever be accused
of Youve scored your point I
cant argue with it Ill settle
for one tan from each company - four
nall

GEN BROULARD
Excellent solution

DAX stands bent in defeat He takes a deep uneven breath

GEN ROUSSEAU
The court martial will meet at
the Chateau at three this after-
noon That will be convenient for
you wont it General

GEN BROULARD

to go into it now Report back to
your command until further orders

CAPT PELLETIER
Yes sir
(he salutes and moves off)

GEN BROULARD
Thats bad stuff It demoralizes
the men Mikes them lose their
faith You must deal with that
sort of thing with the utmost
severity

GEN ROUSSEAU
I quite agree with you And the
worst punishment would be shelving
Say to Macedonia or a colony Hes
an ambitious man and very trouble -

GEN BROULARD
A court of inquiry ought to roast
him a bit first

GEN ROUSSEAU
In cases like thisshells falling
short - I always try to avoid an
inquiry It gets around among the

Shelving will be the best discipline
for him at least in my opinion

It is a neat orderly place

CAPT RENOUART

(shriily)
This is insane Its cold blooded
murder I cant choose a man You
cant ask me to My men arent
cowards They didnt mutiny You
cant really expect me to pick an
innocent man and send him to his
death just because those idiots want
to look good in the newspapers Why
they dont stand any chance at all
Even with you defending the men they
dont have a prayer

(a touch of sarcasm)

COL DAX

Youre right about one thing I
wont make a bit of difference
Ill do my best Try to make things
as difficult as I can for Rousseau
but its his game He mikes the rules
and decides when its over Look
this isnt going to be a trial

(continued

COL DAX (contd)

Theres no question here of guilt
or innocence The only question
4s what does Rousseau intend to
do I accomplished something up
there this afternoon at least I
think I did For one thing I got
them to cut down from forty men to
our

CAPT RENOUART
I suppose if you could get it down
to one youd throw a party

COL DAX
Dont you think your sarcasm is run
ning away with itself a little
Slice 1t anyway you like four is a
lot better than forty

CAPT RENOUART
I doubt if the four would say 80

COL DAX

ignoring remark)
I did something else too maybe
even more important I think I
showed Rousseau the possibility that
if there are repercussions on this
the staff may not be standing behind
him I tried to underscore that
pretty hard The biggest hope now
is that I mde this point clear
enough and that Rousseau is going
through with this deal just to make
some kind of a grandstand play Maybe
give the boys a year at hard labor or
something of that sort

Youve got 1t all nicely tied up and
packaged with pretty pink ribbon

But I did something about it I
worked as hard as I could pulling
every trick in my bag What am I

CAPTAIN SANCY
The beauty of this mess is its
freedom from complication All
the men are equally innocent
None of them showed cowardice but
one of thems got to be shot for it
nonetheless Now the point is which
one

SGT PATIN
I dont see how thats so beautiful
Do you call that justice

CAPT SANY
Who said anything about justice
Theres no such thing But in-
justice is as much and part of life
as the weather Anyway the lucky
fellow will be making his oontribu-
tion to Winning the war

SGT PATIN
In other words you think the man
who is shot is as much a part of the
scheme of things as the officer who
calculates the barrage the infantry-
man who goes over the top or the
quartermaster who doesnt

CAPT SANCY

Certainly discipline is the first
requisite of the army It must be
maintained and one of the ways to
do it is to shoot a min now and then
just to show the others how smart
they are to be on the right side

He dies therefore for the ultimte
benefit of his comrades and his

country
SGT PATIN
Have you anyone in mind
CAPT SANCY

I have two people clearly in mind
- the two incorrigibles Meyer and
Ferol They are lucky to have this
opportunity

( - 2)

SGT PATIN
They also happen to be among the
best soldiers in the company
As a matter of record they got
farther in the attack than anyone
in the regiment

CAPT SANCY
Which adds one more proof of their
Stupidity Try to get this straight
If the whole regiment had been made
up of Meyers and Ferols would it
have done any better No Shells
ki11 good soldiers just as fast as
bad ones in fact even faster
Were all cannon fodder

SaT PATIN
Well then it looks like Meyers
elected
CAPT SANCY
What makes you say that
SGT PATIN
He 1s the worst of the two
CAPT SANY

Yes on the face of it thats true
But theres another important cir-
cumstance youve overlooked Hes

a Jew
SGT PATIN
All the more reason -
CAPT SANCY

Thats where youre wrong Youre
being shortsighted This is one
time when being a Jew is going to
save a mans life instead of costing

him it
SGT PATIN
I dont follow you
CAPT SANCY

Do you remember the Dreyfus case
( )
( - 3) 31

Sat PATIN
Ive heard of it of course
but whats that got to do with
this

CAPT SANCY
A great deal Its a lesson thats
all a lesson against exposing your-
self to the same thing over again

SGT PATIN
But this isnt going to be a
Dreyfus case

CAPT SANCY
No one thought the Dreyfus case was
going to be one either They never
dreamed when they picked on that
quiet little Jewish officer that the
whole world would ring with his name
for years to follow That ministry
after ministry would fall and a war
loom possible becaanse of him Or
that the entire nation of France
would be kept in a state of distur-
bance over him and his fate No if
I chose Meyer the cry of anti-
semitism would undoubtedly be raised
rightfully 50 too No one oan say
when or at whose expense that cry
would be silenced Thats where Im
using my head I want to be clean

SGT PATIN
Its tough on Ferol though Meyers
and Jew s0 he becomes the patsy

CAPT SANCY
Its always tough on somebody
Thats the way life is

COL DAX (cont ta)
In the first place youve got no
witnesses Secondly even if you
had I think the story would only
antagonize the court They wouldnt
tolerate an enlisted man bringing
Buch accusations against an officer
partioularly since its irrelevant
to the charges youre being tried
for Why Lieutenant Roget chose you
among your entire company has nothing
whatsoever to do with the charge of
cowardice Take my advice and dont
say a word about that affair at the
court martial If and when we get
clear of all this we can take the
story of the patrol up on a regi-
mental level

DAX crosses to the window inhaling deeply on his cigarette

COL DAX

question and I want you to answer
it in absolute honesty It will
be for your own good if you do
And it might do you a lot of harm
if you dont If Iam to defend

appeared Colonel and chewed out
Lieutenant Roget

COL DAX

My advice to you is to stick to
those stories Tell them simply
and dont let the prosecutor shake
you out of them Now one or two
hints on your behavior Remember
that you will still be soldiers in
the presence of your superior
officers not litigants before a
bar of justice Make your bearing
respectful but in no means cringing
Act like what you are soldiers and
brave ones at that but dont overdo
it to the point of seeming arrogant
or lacking in a sense of discipline
Ive looked at the room where the
court will sit You will have the
afternoon light in your eyes Dont
let thie disconcert you and above
all dont let it mke it seem as if
you were dropping your eyes hang-
dog fashion When you are speaking
look each judge in the eye Dont
whine or plead or mike speeches Just
mike simple statements in a soldierly
manner Make them short but make them
so they can be heard all over the room

not to repeat yourselves Ill do
that for you when I sum up J1ll empha-
size the points you brought up in your
testimony

any shadow of a doubt that the
accused are guilty of cowardice in
the face of the enemy I shall
therefore confine myself to re-

Military Justice to find the accused
guilty of the charges as stated and
to impose the penalty which is pre-
scribed by the code Thank you

Honored judges of the court it is
impossible for me to summrize the
case for the defense since the court
has not allowed me a reasonable oppor-
tunity to present my case in a manner
which would mke it forceful and under-
standable I have been prevented from
introducing evidence that I consider
vital to the defense I have been denied
the privilege of cross-examination
The prosecution has presented no wit-
nesses Furthermore there has been no
written indictment of charges against
the defendants and the defense has
never had an opportunity to study the
alleged charges prior to the trial
Lastly I protest against the fact that
no stenographic notes of the trial
nave been kept It is my absolute
conviction that the aforesaid con-
atitutes a gross violation of legal
procedure which in itself renders this
court martial null and void

The men have just been served and magnificent meal Roast
beef potatoes augratin assorted vegetables seeded
rolls wine and and tray of pastries It has been placed
on a fine white linen tablecloth which now adorns the
rough table There are but two things lacking - chairs
and silverware

Two armed guards wait at the iron door for the KP who
served the meal

The condemned men hover about the table distractedly

They seem to breathe in short gasps They have and strange
brilliance about the eyes a kind of glazed feverish
quality Their movements are jerky and often seem to start
without purpose then once abandoned the purpose is
remembered

The men stare blankly at the food FEROL picks at the
potatoes with his fingers Little by little theyall
begin to gather up food in a variety of grotesque ways -
peeling strips of meat off scooping up pastries etc
Gradually the scene begins to resemble what might occur
if savages went to a buffet luncheon They eat with a
frenzy Stuffing food into their mouths as quickly as
they aan Suddenly PARIS bolts away from the table into
the corner and wretches violently

This seems to interfere with the pleasure of the others
and they slowly chew to halt breathing hard as if to
prevent a similar fate from overtaking their dinner

time learning how to use knives
and forks and now were back to

what shrill - and they seem to be searching for something

my I say sir that I quite clearly
see the Armys grievance The issue
is cloudy and because of that I was
quite able to mke it even cloudier
But I must in all honesty agree there
is a legitimte grievance on the Armys
part it is an indisputable fact that
some men of the lead battalion never
left the trenches I went forward ny-
self under fire and found them huddled
together like frightened children
Granted the fire was withering and many
of them would have been killed never-
theless they were in the trenches
when they should have been moving for-

assault would have vitally effected
the result but in all truth who knows

over the top - who got as far as
the enemy wire - who saw their
friends fall all around them

What would they think if we let the
shirkers get away with it

COL DAX

I believe youre sincere in what
you say I also agree that there
is a great deal of merit in your
position But may I respectfully
ask in the confidence of this
library isnt there yet another
reason at play in your decision to
allow those men to die as examples

GEN BROULARD
I cant lie to you Dax you know
very well there is But damning
as it may sound it is a seconda
consideration It is in fact you

might say making the most of a tragic

situation course the General
Staff would tive to shift the burden
of failure off its own shoulders
Why not Were subject to all kinds
of unfair pressure from ambitious
civilians and politicians We think
were doing good job -- helping
France Why should we bear any more
criticism than we have to

COL DAX
In other words you feel that as long
as the men are to some extent guilty
of cowardice and as long as it is
truly necessary to set an example for
the good of the others you feel that
is a kirwof lucky convenience for the
General Staff that it can also dump
the responsibility of failure onto
the men

GEN BROULARD
Thats close to it Its no worse
than when the police find some hood-
lum shot dead in the street they
claim him to be the cause of one or
two of their long outstanding unsolved

crimes We cant undo the attack
We undertook it with sincere faith
in its possibilities It wasnt in
the oards thats all

COL DAX
General I am really quite sym-
pathetic to your point of view «-
although I suppose it would be
truer to say I understand your
point of view It finally comes
down to a clear moral issue that
applies both to the execution of
the men as andn example amd to the
shifting of blame onto innocent
Shoulders You fcel that dise
honest as it may be to blame the
men for the staffs failure it none-
theless serves a higher purpose It
helps preserve the staff which is
doing good for France It protects
the staff from its critics who are
perhaps more interested in personal
ambition than in the good the
country I suspect you my also feel
it is rather inhuman to select men
at random from the battalion and have
them executed as an example but
this top will perhaps save other
lives in the future by welding the men
of the Army into a more efficient
fighting force

GEN BROULARD
Very well put Dax though somehow
I take it you dont approve

COL DAX
There are people who might argue that
good cannot come from evil That the
ends cannot be used to justify the
means That if it were possible to do
away with all the injustice and cruelty
in the world at the expense of the
murder of and single innocent child that
they would think it wrong to kill the
echt °

GEN BROULARD
Then you dont approve of the means
But its easy for you when you dont
have the responsibility of the Arny
to carry

COL DAX
I can hardly say I dont approve
of the means when I am about to
employ a mean which it would be
hard to say is more elevated

GEN BROULARD
(pleasantly)
I dont follow you Dax

COL DAX

Despite the fact that I understand
your reasons I am absolutely cone
vinced and11 explanations considered
that the execution of those men to-
morrow morning would be a monstrous
and inhuran thing My position is
really very clear at least to me
Although for a while I wasnt sure
myself where I stood because I was
blinded by your reasons Certainly
there is samething to be gained by
killing those men From a practical
atandpoint perhaps much more than
by saving them In the end it comes
down to and very simple realization
Executing those men is a brutal and
inhuman thing I dont have to carry
my moral searchings any further than
that And I intend to stop it -- or
ZI should say to have you stop it

GEN BROULARD

COL DAX
It seems General that a certain
Captain came to see me this after-
noon and Captain Pelletier commanding
Eattery B of Division artillery

GEN BROULARD
The name seems familiar

COL DAX
I believe you met him briefly after
the inquiry this afternoon - somee
thing about some shells falling short

GEN BROULARD
Oh yes I recall now

COL DAX
Would you be surprised to learn that
General Rousseau ordered Captain
Pelletier to fire on the French
trenches Yes into the French
trenches During the attack when
the advance was faltering in the
Germain wire General Rousseau ordered
Captain Pelletier to open fire on the
men who hadnt left the trenches --
the so-called mutineers Captain
Pelletier refused to do this without
a written order General Rousseau took
the phone himself and ordered Captain
Pelletier in front of the telephone
clerk and Captain Nichols the
artillery spotter to fire into our
own trenches Again Captain Pelletier
refused without a written order Again
he was ordered and again he refused
l1 in front of witnesses

GEN BROULARD
Colonel you are aware I should hope
that General Rousseau has placed this
Captain Pelletier on report for some
poorly registered shots that fell short
on our own men while they were advancing
Do you really believe this fantastic
story which has obviously been concocted
by Captain Pelletier and his friends to
cover up their own mistakes

-l21l

( - 7)

COL DAX
Yes General Ido Furthermore
I have sworn depositions from al
the principals concerned with this
affair And most important I
really dont care at this moment
whether their story is true or not
It serves my purpose in either
variation In fact I should act
the same even if I mew for an
absolute certainty that their
stories were entirely false

GEN BROULARD
(a bit shaken)
You know Dax Im beginning to
find your attitude just a little
annoying Im really not used to
being spoken to in this manner

COL DAX
(a little hot under
the collar
Im sorry General I meant no offense
or breach of good taste But you see
General were talking about the
lives of three men

GEN BROULARD
Frankly despite the fact that I have
no legal background I can see quite
clearly that this matter of the
artillery Captain 1s quite irrelevant
to the charges against the condemned
men

COL DAX

And Im not a newspaper man or a
politician but I can recognize in
this situation of a French General
ordering his own artillery to fire on
his own French troops the type of
story that fires the imagination of
the people That brings forth every
crusader for justice and the rights
of nin That starts the politicians
buzzing in the beck rooms -- all
searching for one thing -- who is
responsible for this outrage against
Justice and humanity Once this self-
righteously hysterical search for the

responsible party begins only God
lkmows where the accusing finger will
come to rest As often as not the
issue Will lose its true purpose
and become a tool in the hand of un-
scrupulous people who will use it
for their own petty schemes

GEN BROULARD
And why should anyone believe those
men

COL DAX
For one reason because they might
want to It might very nicely serve
their purposes to believe the story
For another because the story would
be presented and documented by the
Colonel in command of the regiment
who was not under arrest who has not
committed any act of cowardice who
is respected member of society and
last but not in any way least who is
and friend of many years standing with
the French press through his activities
as a lawyer in Paris

BROULARD gets up crosses to his desk and grinds out his
cigar in an ash-tray The full extent of his anger is only
now beginning to show itself

vigorously conducts them

The Regiments officers are distributed in small groups
in front of the lines of men

Three black posts spaced about ten feet apart and backed
by a wooded slope form the fourth side of the square

A small detail of men stand near the execution posts

oblivious to anything but the sound of approaching foote

enters followed by the guards and stretcher bearers

Suddenly the room is orowded with activity The stretcher-

the condemmed as if the doomed men are afflicted with
some deadly and infectious disease with which any contact

to form up and the colum moves off again for the last
time PARISS hand has slipped off the stretcher and
grotesquely bobs up and down One of the guards gingerly
places it back at his side

The condemned men and their escort pause at the edge of
the grassy field SERGEANT GONOUD gives the final orders
and they parade out past the Regiment During the pause
the band abruptly stops playing As the column moves fore
ward again it is accompanied by a muffled dirge-like
drumning - a8 if each slow beat marked another beat of
time less for the condemned men to live

We shall INTERCUT various shots of the men of the Regiment
with the condemned as they pass in a kind of grim review
We cannot avoid noticing the ironic contrast between the
impressive military formations standing at attention
Regimental banners cracking in the breeze and the
pathetic shuffling of the prisoners ‘he vibrance of the
sunny morning with the blackened execution poles The
sounds of bird-Song and trees rustling with the funereal
drums

FEROL still prays the PRIEST alongside ARNAUD carries
himself properly and only someone close-by might notice
the animandl panic in his eyes

himself up to his full height A few moments later as
the column passes GENERAL ROUSSEAUS group ARNAUD turns
mijestically to GENERAL ROUSSEAU

PVT ARNAUD
(great disdain)
Assassin «- watch a hero die

His guards press in closely but they are not needed He
turns away solemnly and continues

By now we have gotten appropriate reactions from almost
all the princd pads in the Regiment LIEUTENANT ROGET
COLONEL 3 PTAIN SANCY PRIVATE MEYER et al

OTHER ANGLES - THE EXECUTION POSS 53

The colum comes to a halt Fhe biack posts are spaced
about ten feet apart Three squads of twelve riflemen
each are placed opposite each pole They stand at
parade-rest in double rows of six They are about twenty-
five feet from the pole

The prisoners are bound to the pole in such and way that
their lifeless bodies will still be supported

PARISS stretcher is propped up against the pole He hangs
forward grotesquely held by ropes As condemned prisoners
often are ARNAUD and FEROL are very anxious to do every

thing correctly They willingly place their arms just so
They both possess the unexplainable cooperativeness of the

condemned

The firing squads stand motionless The PRIEST continues
his spiritual efforts SERGEANTS GONOUD and BOULANGER
are everywhere checking and double checking
SGT GONOUD
(to Arnaud
Do you want a blindfold

Py ARNAUD
No please no blindfold

(to Ferol)
Do you want a blindfold
PVT FEROL
Yes
VARIOUS ANGLES INTERCUI 54

During the above action at the appropriate moments we
will cut away to get reactions from certain principals

FROM THE PRISONERS VIEWPOINT 55

The following action is all played from the prisoners
viewpoint Everything is seen in long shot and either
unheard or heard indistinctly

fhe drums roll MAJOR COUDERC solemnly walks to the
center of the parade ground The regiment seems a solid
wall He raises and sheet of paper

MAJOR COUDERC

(slowly
In the name of the French people
on this day the fourteenth day
of the month of September in the
year of our Lord one thousand
nine hundred and fifteen the
verdict of the Summary Court
Martial of the Chateau de LAigile
will be fulfilled accordingly
The soldiers Maurice Ferol Pierre
Arnaud and Henri Paris of the one
hundred and eighty-first regiment
of the fourth division having been
proven guilty of cowardice in the
face of the enemy during the attack
on the enemy line on September twelve
of the year of our Lord one thousand
nine hundred and fifteen are to be
executed by rifle fire in accordance
with the judgment of the Summary Court
Martial

During the last third of MAJOR COUDERCS speech the fol-
lowing action begins It is seen in long-shot and notre
can be heard of the dialogue The length of MAJOR s
speech will be altered accordingly to fit the following
action

-140-

( 1) 55

GENERAL BROULARDS black staff car pulls Slowly to a halt
at the edge of the parade ground

The soldier-chauffeur opens the rear door The fat Colonel
DE GUERVILLE who we have seen before as a member of GENERAL
BROULARDS staff exits stiffly carrying a brief-case

A tall junior officer detaches himseif from GENERAL
ROUSSEAUS group and hurries to the car The two officers
exchange salutes and converse briefly

The junior officer salutes again and leads the COLONEL to
GENERAL ROUSSEAU

They exchange salutes and converse briefly The COLONEL
produces andn envelope froma brief-case ROUSSEAU opens
it and reads from a single piece of paper He lowers the
paper slowly He says a few words to the COLONEL The
COLONEL shakes his head ROUSSEAU glances at the paper
again

At this moment MAJOR COUDERC finishes reading the death
sentence and returns to ROUSSEAU’S group ROUSSEAU
speaks to several juntor officers One of them salutes
and turns to non-com

The non-com salutes and jogs across the field to the
firing squad He salutes and addresses SERGEANT BOULANGER
SERGEANT GONOUD joins them ‘The non-com salutes and walks
away SERGEANT BOULANGER walks to the front of the firing
squad

SGT BOULANGER
Squaa-ds right shoulder haw

He issues the appropriate commnds to march the firing squads
away The band strikes up a spirited march Other orders
are shouted indistinctly in the background The non-coms
begin to march the regiment off the parade grounds

ANOTHER ANGLE - PHE CONDEMNED MEN 56

SERGEANT GONOUD his face split by a grin runs up to the
prisoners

SGT GONOUD
You boys really have a friend some
place General Broulards gust
commuted your sentences to thirty
days in the guardhouse Here get
these men untied I drink to your
health
(swigs deeply at canteen)

( - 1) 56

The guard detail struggles with the ropes They smile
sheepishly ARNAUD suddenly goes berserk He grimaces
and begins snorting and drooling Partially free he
Jerks away from the execution stake A rope still holds
his ankles He spills over on his face He claws at
the ground The guards gently try to calm him At the
Same time FEROL smiles smugly as he is untied

PVT FEROL
I knew it I knew it by God
I knew it ZI knew I wouldn¢
die I knew it

ANOTHER ANGLE - GENERAL ROUSSEAU 57

He has drifted off by himself His starr seems to have
wandered off He stands alone a beaten figure In the
background the regiment is being briskly marched off the
parade ground to the accompaniment of unintelligible
shouted commands and the brassy strains of a French march
DAX approaches hin

COL DAX
Good-morning General

GEN ROUSSEAU
(1e1ly
Good-morning Colonel

They both stand at a loss for words ROUSSEAU looks up
sharply

GEN ROUSSEAU
Perhaps you will be interested to
kmow Colonel that in addition to
this magnificent last minute bit
of grand opera on the part of General
Broulard I have been relieved of ny
command pending further inquiry

COL DAX

(sincerely)
Im sorry to hear that sir I hope
youll believe me if I say that in
spite of what I thought of your
handling of thisaffair I have
always had the greatest professional
respect for you I meant you no
personal harm

-142-

( 1)

GEN ROUSSEAU
(bitterly)
I believe you Colonel There is
nothing like real regret for
brightening a bad conscience

COL DAX
(peeved)
I can assure you sir there is
nothing whatsoever on my conscience

GEN ROUSSEAU
Well then you must be very proud
of yourself Colonel

COL DAX
I thank God this terrible thing did
not happen Ill say it again Im
not proud of doing injury to you
Bir I have always regarded you as
a fighting commander a rarity in
any army It will be a great loss
to the army if your abilities are
put aside due to this

GEN ROUSSEAU
Is there any doubt in your mind
Colonel that I shall receive the
full share of credit for all this

COL DAX
If its any consolation to you sir
you must be aware that it is not
Altogether unlikely that I my expect
some little momento of the Staffs
displeasure ands5 soon as everything
quiets down

ROUSSEAU looks around at the regiment marching away It
is apparent that he was not without a great deal of
devotion for his men whatever his actions may have been

GEN ROUSSEAU
Would you care to walk a little way
with me Colonel

COL DAX
Thank you sir Id be very happy
to

-143-

( - 2)

GEN ROUSSEAU

This may sound like sour grapes
but ina way Im not sorry for
myself Perhaps Im even glad
its over and done with Someone
once said The two essential ine
gredients of progress are fire and
unerals Perhaps man can grow
weary of being the instrument of
that kind of progress

They walk along in a friendly silence

GEN ROUSSEAU
(expansively)
Which one of us was on the side of
the angels I wonder

COL DAX
Im not sure I follow you sir

GEN ROUSSEAU
Well take for instance the case
of the early Christians What was
it perhaps more than anything else
that strengthened and solidified
them -- persecution wouldnt you
say The cruelest kind of injustice
Tyranny gave birth to the Magna Carta
Callousness and indifference to human
welfare brought about the French
Republic And so on through History
It may be that progress comes really
through kind of challenge And who
is to say that if those men had been
shot today that 16 wouldnt have
been and step towards the end of a cer
tain kind of despotism in the army

COL DAX
General you have a very strange
theory there I am not at all sure
that I agree with you

GEN ROUSSEAU
Im not at all sure I agree with my-
self You know perhaps when they
say man is a rational animal what
they really mean is that he has a
limitless ability to rationalize
(continued )

They walk in
up brightly

3) ST

GEN ROUSSEAU (cont d)
to mike excuses for himself to
feel self-righteous no mtter what
he does I dont know why Im
rambling on like this Probably be-
cause theres nothing left for me to
do but talk You know Colonel I am
undoubtedly a very wicked man - but
I dont feel wicked inside Though
ZI suppose thats a prerequisite
for being labeled truly wicked

COL DAX
labels are fine for tin cans but
not for people I dontt know
perhaps every man is as righteous
as the circumstances of his life
allow him to be

GEN ROUSSEAU
That doesnt explain very much
Colonel

COL DAX
Perhaps there are no explanations
Perhaps we do what we have to
But you know I was just thinking
of and conversation I once had with a
client of mine who was an Atheist
I asked him how he could possibly
believe that Christianity was a
failure that it hadnt worked
Very simple he said It was never
tried

a meditative silence ROUSSEAU finally looks

GEN ROUSSEAU
Colonel my I ask you to join me
at the Chateau for some coffee

COL DAX
Id be very happy to sir I might
even suggest something a little
stronger if it isnt too early for
you

145-

( - 4)
ROUSSEAU laughs and puts his arm around DAXS shoulder

GEN ROUSSEAU
It isnt too early for me Colonel
In fact Id say it was rather

late

They walk away from the camera The last fading strains
of the band are heard
FADE OUT

THE END
