been following it myself and all
of a sudden I thoughtradio

Katherine leans forward smiling patiently

A BEAT

KATHERINE
Uh-huh But Trask is looking for
television stations

TESS

Sos every Tom Dick and Harry My

idea is they get their feet wet in
radio build from there Not as
glamorous as jumping right into TV

but its a solid place to start and
theres a lot more of them for sale

Plus it solves Trasks problem with
his Japanese competitors trying to

take him over -- FCC forbids foreign

ownership of radio stations as well
as TV

unsuccessfully At the same time

fighting off hostile takeover attempts

would in one fell swoop accomplish
two important tasks -- give Trask
a solid base in broadcasting and
because of FCC regulations
forbidding foreign ownership of
radio stations wipe out the threat
of the Japanese takeover

Mr Trask doesnt sit in on
this level

TESS

(embarrased)
Course not Well Why dont I
just begin then

(a beat then)
Heres the way I see it Trask
Electronics has two big needs
at this point in time -- to protect
themselves from a hostile takeover
by a Japanese competitor and to
diversify by expanding into
broadcasting Acquiring a television
network would solve both needs
but that could take til kingdom
come By acquiring the Metro Radio
System you nail the two birds with
one stone and quickly You get
your FCC license to guard against
the Japanese and you get a solid
profitable foundation in broadcasting
And you can have it now If you turn
to page four of the prospectus
youll see --

Draper interrupts her

DRAPER
Excuse me Ms McGill but
do you have another proposal
besides Metro

TESS
(surprised)
No Why

Trask take the meeting
