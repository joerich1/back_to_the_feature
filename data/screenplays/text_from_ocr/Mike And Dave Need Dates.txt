Over OPENING CREDITS we see a montage of the most EPIC PARTY
MOMENTS of MIKE and DAVE two fun-loving guys mid 20s
brothers and best friends Set to trippy hip-hop it’s shot
in surreal balletic SLO-MO Gravity meets Jackass

-- Mike and Dave light fireworks with a lit joint watch in
awe as they shoot off and light up the night sky Mike
majestically leaps over the fireworks as Dave laughs

-- Mike and Dave fly IN and OUT of frame We see they’re
jumping off a roof and onto a giant TRAMPOLINE set up in a
backyard Mike flies up so high he sweetly KISSES a girl who
sits on the roof

-- Mike and Dave lead a giant dance party at a family
birthday party They dance over to Grandpa and Grandma who
sit at a table coax them into joining the dance party
Grandpa and Grandma shake their thang and everyone cheers

-- Behind a bar Mike and Dave make the craziest most
elaborate drink you’ve ever seen They muddle mint zest
limes pour grain alcohol Absinthe beer and a dash of
Jaegermeister into a Vikings helmet then LIGHT IT ON FIRE

-- At their cousin GARY’s Bar Mitzvah Mike and Dave
heroically hoist Gary in the air during the Torah Gary howls
in joy having the time of his life and we are

INT OFFICE - DAY

The corporate offices of a liquor distributor MIKE STANGEL
a sweet energetic guy late 20s sits at a conference table
His BOSS addresses the troops Mike raises his hand eager

BOSS
So I think you’ll see across our
last fiscal quarter we managed--
(seeing Mike’s hand)
Uhhhyeah Mike

MIKE
Fred If I could

Mike walks to the front of the room

MIKE (CONTD)
Everyone knows where the future is
It’s in ocean cruises We’re a
liquor distributor Can you imagine
if we had our own cruise ship that
served only our liquors A “booze
cruise” if you will Shall we set
sail gentlemen
Mike pauses allowing his point to sink in We see the other
employees roll their eyes shake their heads at Mike

BOSS
Mike we don’t have money for a
cruise ship Do you know how much
that would cost

MIKE
No but let’s roll up the sleeves
crunch some numbers figure it out

BOSS
And why did you come up to the
front of the room I’ve told you I
don’t like it when you do that

MIKE
Just trying to help the team
Youve all read my Monday Morning
Mike emails I’ve got ideas

BOSS
Sit down Now

EXT DAVE’S HOUSE - DAY

Mike pulls into the driveway honks Mike’s younger brother
DAVE runs out SLIDES across the hood like a badass on TV

DAVE
Whooooo That was nice right

MIKE
It was okay You’re on the drivers
side now I’m driving So there was
kind of no point to that Also I
think you scratched my hood

DAVE
Youre totally right Sorry about
that I got excited
Dave slowly walks around to the passenger side shrugging
DAVE (CONTD)
Again sorry about your hood

INT EXT MIKE’S CAR - LATER

Mike and Dave are driving Mike flips around the radio
stations It lands on “Patience” by Guns and Roses
DAVE
Don’t change it I love this song
And it supports my theory that
every song is better when there’s
whistling in it

MIKE
That’s a hard theory to argue with
Dave

Mike and Dave start whistling along to the song smiling

DAVE
I wonder why Mom and Dad asked us
to come over to the house tonight

MIKE
Yeah Mom seemed a little cagey on
the phone Like it was a big secret
or something Ooh I know What if
Mom and Dad are getting a divorce

DAVE
God I hope not

MIKE
C’mon Dave Mom could do way
better She’s pretty hot for her
age and Dad’s kinda let himself go
Haven’t you ever fantasized about
having a different father

DAVE
No That’s so weird Sometimes I
fantasize about having a different
brother though

Dave chuckles at his joke Mike turns to Dave serious

MIKE
Take it back bro

DAVE
I’m kidding Mike Don’t be so
sensitive You know I love you

MIKE
I love you too Wait I know They
probably just want to bounce some
ideas off of us about Jeanie’s
wedding

DAVE
You’re so right Makes total sense
MIKE
This is a major event Dave First
Stangel kid to get married We
gotta go big with our speech

DAVE
Yeah I’ve been thinking about
that What if we didn’t go big with
our speech What if we just got up
there and spoke from the heart Ya
know start off with a joke Bring
em in laughing take em out crying

MIKE
Of course we’ll do that That’s
wedding speech 101 But we gotta
blow it out Dancing singing
pyrotechnics lasers trampolines
Weve been planning this for
months we’ve sent lots of emails
back and forth

DAVE
Mostly you’ve sent the emails

MIKE
Yeah and then you responded
“Great idea Mike” You’re just
nervous don’t worry we’re gonna
kill it

We can tell Dave doesn’t want to rock the boat

DAVE
Yeah You’re right We’re gonna
kill it

STANGEL HOUSE - AFTERNOON

MIKE
Hey Dave there’s your tree

DAVE
C’mon Mike It’s not funny anymore

MIKE
Is it uncomfortable seeing your
first love like this after so long

nods along

Mike and Dave walk up to their parents’ house a modest
suburban home Mike points to a big tree in the yard
DAVE
(said it a million times)
I was taking a piss

MIKE
No you weren’t Dave I was there
You were inside this tree You lost
your virginity to this tree

Dave can’t help but smile It’s kind of funny Mike walks
over to the tree and starts humping it talking sexy

MIKE (CONTD)
Oh Branchy I think I’m inside your
inner ring It’s so tight Uh Uh

The front door opens and Mike and Dave’s father BURT STANGEL
stands in the doorway watches Mike hump the tree Dressed in
chinos and a tucked-in button down shirt Burt is an old-
school guy mid-50s who believes in hard work firm
handshakes and paying cash He also looks like a fun guy to
have a beer with But not right now

BURT
Uh Mike When you’re done having
sex with the oak tree can you and
your brother come inside please

Mike holds up his hand still thrusting

MIKE
Just a second Dad Almost done
(then )
OOOOCOOWWWWW BRANCHY

Mike pats the tree and walks inside past Burt He gives his
dad an awkward hug that is mostly a rough back pat

MIKE (CONTD)
How’s it going Pops You look
good You lose weight

INT STANGEL HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Mike and Dave enter to find their mother ROSIE (sweet 50s)
their sister JEANIE (pretty mid 20s) and Jeanie’s fiance

ERIC (well dressed nice guy) sitting in a u-shape of chairs

BURT
Have a seat boys
MIKE
Is this an intervention How many
times do we have to tell you Dad
were not alcoholics We just enjoy
alcohol There’s a big difference

Burt urges the boys to sit Burt takes his seat as

BURT
We wanted to discuss Jeanie and
Eric’s wedding

Mike smacks Dave on the arm excited

MIKE
Yes I’ve been told Dave and I have
been given 15 minutes for our
speech slash presentation Is that
going to be at the rehearsal dinner
or the day of the actual wedding

BURT
(sighing)
It’s the day of the wedding Mike

MIKE
Yes Prime spot Thanks Jeanie We
will not let you down We can also
help you planning Like DJ or
band Your first thought -- band
“Its live it’s cool” Wrong DJ
every time You want to hear the
actual songs

Burt puts his hand up stops Mike

BURT
The planning is all taken care of
We want to talk about you two Over
the years a theme has emerged at
our family gatherings Everyones
having a good time things are
going smooth And then you and your
brother show up

MIKE
and we have a really good time
and share that good time with other
people who are also having a good
time

well
BURT
No You come stag get drunk hit
on every girl act like idiots and
ruin the party

Mike and Dave look at each other confused

DAVE
Wow that’s a little harsh don’t
you think Dad

MIKE
Yeah When have we ruined one
family event I can’t remember can
you Dave

DAVE
Not off the top of my head no

BURT
I thought you might say that

Burt turns on a video of the same Mike and Dave party moments
we saw in the opening credits sequence but instead of
looking slo-mo and awesome the footage is super raw (mostly
handheld home video) and shows the destructive consequences
of all the “cool” stuff we saw Mike and Dave do earlier

-- Fireworks We reveal Mike and Dave are actually at a
FAMILY 4TH OF JULY BBQ One firework SHOOTS into a nearby
BOATHOUSE which is quickly ENGULFED IN FLAMES The door to
the boat house opens and AUNT GLADYS and UNCLE FRANK run
out yelling scared for their lives

-- Trampolines Mike flies up to the roof sweetly kisses a
girl on the cheek He bounds back off the trampoline up to
the roof about to kiss the girl again but this time CRASHES
right into her knocking her off the roof

During this Dave whispers to Mike

DAVE
Man Can you believe this

MIKE
I know when did Dad get so tech
savvy He barely knows how to work
the DVR

-- Flaming Viking shots Reveal Mike and Dave are at their
cousin’s high school graduation party They hand their 17
year old cousin the “Flaming Viking” shot He downs it and
promptly VOMITS into a trash can

-- The Horah Mike and Dave hoist their Cousin Gary too high
into the air He flies off the chair screaming and lands
awkwardly on the ground

-- Grandpa and Grandma get funky on the dance floor
Grandpa’s eyes go wide he clutches his chest Cut to Grandpa
getting put into an ambulance on a gurney everyone around
him weeping The video ends and Burt spreads his arms

BURT
Need I say more

MIKE
Are you trying to suggest that we
killed Grandpa He lived for five
years after that That’s crazy
guilt you’re trying to put on us
Shame on you

DAVE
Plus you’re only showing the screw-
ups You’re not showing the
tracking shots of smiling faces of
everyone appreciating our antics
and going “Mike and Dave are super
fun guys I’m glad they’re here”

MIKE
Well said Dave You’re sitting
here calling us idiots telling us
we “ruin” the party Just cause
were single with active libidos
were animals We’re the good guys

Mike and Dave’s mom ROSIE pipes in

ROSIE
You two have been a pain in the ass
since you were kids It’s always
the same Mike has a stupid idea--

MIKE
Whoah

ROSIE
And he drags Dave into it and Dave
is too sweet and passive to stop
him

DAVE
Hey I have ideas too
ROSIE
Come on Dave Everyone knows
youre a pushover You’ve got a big
heart That’s what we love about
you

DAVE
It sounds like you’re complimenting
me but you’re not

ROSIE
What Admit it You’re kind of a

pussy

Dave looks at everyone like Rosie is crazy Everyone avoids
eye contact

BURT
All I want is for you to behave
yourselves It’s the most important
day of Jeanie’s life and you’re not
going to ruin it

MIKE
Fine we’ll behave We still can
talk to girls right Dad

BURT
You can talk to girls The ones you
bring to the wedding

This stops Mike and Dave who share a confused glance

DAVE
You meandates

BURT
Youre not showing up stag and
riling each other up

MIKE
A lot of adults come solo Uncle Ed
never brings a date

BURT
That’s because his wife died

MIKE
Oh yeah So that was a bad example

An uncomfortable beat as everyone looks away Finally
Jeanie who’s sat quietly the entire time speaks

JEANIE
Guys stop This wasn’t Dad’s idea
It was mine

Mike and Dave turn to Jeanie taken aback

JEANIE (CONT’D)
I love the shit out of you guys
But everyone’s really stressed out
about this wedding Dad’s spending
a ton of money Like he never
stops talking about it Just be
cool Please For me

Mike and Dave both look down ashamed

DAVE
Of course We wouldn’t do anything
to mess up your wedding Jeanie

MIKE
Yeah don’t worry we’ll be cool
We love you Jeanie We want this
to be the best day of your life
You too Eric

Eric nods appreciative Everyone breathes a sigh of relief
glad it’s over Then

MIKE (CONTD)
Can we watch that video again
Cause whoever cut this together did
an amazing job

INT MIKE AND DAVE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Mike and Dave knock back beers in their apartment

MIKE
I’ve got one thing to say Fuck
Dad I’m 28 years old I don’t need
my dad to tell me how to behave
You know what he’s doing He’s
infantilizing me I saw it on
Oprah It means treating me like a
baby

DAVE
Why are you taking this so
personally It’s not that big of a
deal
MIKE
Dave you know how I feel about
being backed into a corner I’m
like a rat I will chew right
through you

DAVE
It’s our sister’s wedding Let’s
just be chill We promised Let’s
just invite some girls we know

MIKE
No can do Dave I’ve burned a lot
bridges A lot

DAVE
You sure have After a while you
kinda feel bad for the girls huh

MIKE

Oh yeah Bless their hearts Plus
you can’t bring any of your exes
They all want to marry you you’re
gonna bring em to a wedding Talk
about sending the wrong signal
Could get super awkward

(impersonating guest)
“Hey Dave when are you popping the
question”

DAVE
Man youre totally right I don’t
want to lead anyone on

MIKE
So what do we do Just walk up to
random girls and invite them to a
wedding in Hawaii

A beat as a smile forms on Mike’s face

MIKE (CONTD)
Wait That sounds like exactly what
we should do

DAVE
That’s really creepy I’m not
walking up to a total stranger and
inviting her to a wedding

MIKE
Why not We have a sweet little
package we’re selling

(MORE )

MIKE (CONTD)
A week in a tropical paradise with
two fun-loving yet surprisingly
well-read bros Where do I sign up

DAVE
OK I see You’re gonna use this as
an opportunity to meet women

MIKE
No I just want to take this
decision seriously and search
thoroughly We can’t just bring any
girl to our sister’s wedding When
youre buying a car you don’t walk
onto the lot and say “I‘1l take
that one” You kick the tires take
her out for a test drive see how
she handles the turns

DAVE
Check your oil with her dipstick
yeah I get it

MIKE
Super crass Dave I was speaking
metaphorically and you took it to a
sophomoric place So it’s decided
Well put an ad online to find our
wedding dates

DAVE
What No Putting an ad online is
not being chill That’s anti-chill
It’s like a big fuck you to Mom and
Dad

MIKE

They said bring dates They didn’t
say how to find them This is the
world we live in Dave Where we
all feel so disconnected from each
other but find connection --
through the internet

(pretending to scroll

through Tinder)

I like you I like you don’t like
you ooh I don’t like you but that
kinda makes me like you

Mike sits down at the computer starts typing

DAVE
Stop typing We haven’t agreed to
anything

(MORE )

DAVE (CONTD)
This is just what Mom was talking
about You have a crazy idea and
you drag me into it

MIKE
I haven’t dragged you into
anything It’s still your decision

DAVE
OK cause I just want to make sure
youre not doing this just to fuck
with Mom and Dad

MIKE
What No Not at all Maybe a
little bit

Mike opens some dating sites Matchcom Okcupid J-date

MIKE (CONTD)
Problem is dating sites are so
boring They’re like little ponds
of the internet If we’re gonna
find the right girls we need to
fish in the ocean cast the widest
net possible

Mike types in “Craigslistcom” and nods intensely at Dave

MIKE (CONTD)
Did I just blow your mind

DAVE
Craigslist I don’t think that’s
the best place to find nice girls

MIKE
Well meet all types of girls on
Craigslist Nice girls Crazy
girls Girls who steal stuff Girls
who collect photos of butts Girls
who like for you to take photos of
their butts It’s gonna get weird
That’s the beauty of Craigslist

Dave psyches himself up stares right at Mike

DAVE
The answer is no Mike This one
time I’m putting my foot down and
saying no

MIKE
I respect that Dave But I beseech
you consider what sounds more fun
the way Mom and Dad want you to do
this or the way I’m suggesting we
do it

DAVE
The way you’re suggesting we do it

MIKE
OK So let’s do it the fun way
Dave That’s a great idea

INT MIKE AND DAVE’S APARTMENT - LATER

On the computer an image of Mike and Dave as BARE-CHESTED
CENTAURS with huge HORSE COCKS galloping at full speed Mike
looks at Dave selling it hard

MIKE
Yesss Yessss

DAVE
No We can’t do this

MIKE
It’s hilarious I guarantee you
would forward that link to your
friends It’s sticky

DAVE
I said NO HORSE COCK You have to
listen to what I say

Dave slams his fist down for emphasis

MIKE
Okay Dave No horse cock See
another great idea by you

Dave erases the horse-cock nods approvingly types

DAVE
My brother and I are looking for
wedding dates to our sister’s
wedding in gorgeous Kauai Hawaii

Mike paces thinking out loud Dave keeps typing

MIKE
Youre probably asking Mike Dave
what’s in it for us Here’s what
(MORE)

MIKE (CONTD)
Bullet points An excuse to get

sign a waiver) Adventure Mystery

least one other person at the
wedding Sisters preferable

DAVE

MIKE
We don’t share the sisters Dave
But we’re brothers they’re
sisters there’s good symmetry to
it And maybe we could share them
(off Dave’s look)
We don’t need to decide now

INT MIKE AND DAVE’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Dave looks at Mike who nods yes Dave CLICKS the mouse and
POSTS their ad to Craigslist

DAVE
Well we’ll see I guess

Mike’s phone vibrates

MIKE
Looks like we got a response

Mike’s phone vibrates again And again It vibrates so much
that it creeps across a table falls to the floor breaks

They run to the computer see a ton of responses Like a ton
We see their INBOX FLOODED with emails from girls who want to
be their dates Some send videos and really revealing photos

MIKE (CONTD)
Whoah I don’t even know what part
of her body that is

DAVE
I think it’s her neck

They look at the next photo

MIKE
That’s definitely not her neck

Dave shakes his head at Mike

MIKE (CONTD)
Holy shit Do you realize what this
means It means our ad’s gone
viral I’ve been dreaming about
this since I was a little kid

DAVE
But we didn’t have the internet
when we were kids There was no
such thing as a viral ad

MIKE
Just let us have this moment Dave

We kick into

Tatiana-Alice spark that defines
our identities as friends and
badass motherfuckers

Tatiana points to a board on the wall a COLLAGE of TATIANA
AND ALICE on VACATIONS - on the beach on a ski slope
drinking in a hot tub on a zip line in a jungle riding ATVS
in Baja In a lot of the photos they are posing with guys
but the guys have been cropped out Tatiana and Alice

proceed to sit on the couch FOR THE ENTIRE NIGHT drinking
and smoking weed watching TV and falling asleep

INT TATIANA AND ALICE’S APARTMENT - EARLY NEXT MORNING

Tatiana eats cereal watches Good Morning America while
Alice sleeps with a joint in her mouth On TV we see Mike
and Dave are getting interviewed by KATIE COURIC

KATIE COURIC (ON TV)
Were back with Mike and Dave
Stangel who made a bit of a stir
by placing an ad on Craigslist
looking for dates to their sister’s
wedding

ON SCREEN Mike and Dave’s ad with the centaur photo

KATIE COURIC (ON TV) (CONTD)
Pretty subtle huh guys

MIKE (ON TV)
You should have seen what Dave
wanted to post it was way crazier
than that

KATIE COURIC (ON TV)
But on Craigslist You don’t find
wedding dates on Craigslist You
find old stereo equipment or
tickets to Coachella

DAVE (ON TV)
We’ve met some fascinating women

MIKE (ON TV)
A lot of them We’re not ones to
shy away from adventure Katie
When it beckons we heed the call

DAVE (ON TV)
And all we’re looking for is two
nice girls to join us for a week in
Hawaii to our sister’s wedding

KATIE COURIC (ON TV)
Are you footing the bill

MIKE (ON TV)
Of course We’re not gonna invite
women to our sister’s wedding and
then ask them to pay their own way
Call us old school

Tatiana leans forward excited

TATIANA
A week in Hawaii A free week in
Hawaii Alice Wake up

Tatiana shakes Alice awake who sports a crazy case of bed
head Tatiana takes a hit off a huge bong hands it to Alice
who takes an even bigger hit still trying to wake up

ALICE
What’s happening

TATIANA
Look On TV You know what that is

ALICE

TATIANA
It’s adventure calling

Alice watches the interview takes another hit

KATIE COURIC (ON TV)
Look you guys seem like nice
enough guys but here’s what I
don’t get Your parents told you to
calm down to not be the center of
attention And then you did the
opposite and made it all about you
just so you could get laid

MIKE
Whoa Hey Katie are you talking
about us Or is this about that
long weekend in the Hamptons you
shared with Matt Lauer

Katie Couric has no response Tatiana cracks up

them upwards into a smile

ALICE
But it’s not a vacation It’s a
wedding

TATIANA

It’s a destination wedding which
implies the element of vacation
Which is the element we’1l be
really into

ON TV we see footage of Mike and Dave on their dates at
their LOCAL BAR Alice pauses the TV as Mike and Dave CRACK
UP laughing They look kind of goofy

ALICE
We don’t even know these guys They
could chop off our heads or use our
skin to make clothes for a doll

TATIANA
No way These guys are too dumb to
kill anyone And if I get a serial
killer-y vibe I’1ll stab them in the
dick with the knife I keep in my
purse and we’re out of there You

you sure a wedding is the best
place for me to be You know cause

TATIANA

that would be stupid What kind of
a floozie bimbo would respond to
this ad

ALICE
Uh Us

TATIANA

Yeah but we’re not like these
idiots They’re like “Oohh Pick
me Pick me” It immediately puts
them in an inferior position It’s
the guys interviewing the girls
Were gonna flip it They don’t
interview us we interview them

ALICE
Oh god this makes me nervous You
know I’m not good at lying I
always make up the craziest thing
that could never be true

TATIANA

into her lie

ALICE (CONTD)
Dave lost a testicle We’re
extremely worried About his lost

The Supermodels look at each other not believing it

SUPERMODEL

ALICE
There’s nothing to see His entire
lower half has been severed off to
save his penis

SUPERMODEL

a drug problem

ALICE

ANGLE ON BURT AND TATIANA

BURT
Youre from South Philly What a
small world I was just back there

TATIANA
Those are pretty good but for my
money Tony Lukes is the way to go

BURT
No way Not better than Pat’s

TATIANA
Hey where you get your cheesesteak
is a very personal decision but
I’m a Tony Lukes girl all the way

BURT
Your choice in cheesesteaks aside
you seem like a pretty nice girl
Truth is maybe I judged you a
little bit for you know the whole
Craigslist ad thing

TATIANA
Ha I don’t blame you I didn’t
answer that ad We just met Mike
and Dave in a bar

(MORE)

TATIANA (CONTD)
You think I’m some dumb bimbo who
just wanted to spend a free week in

Mike comes over smiles at Tatiana

MIKE

Tatiana presents a flyer

TATIANA (CONTD)

it’s not really your role to--

JEANIE

do I’m a huge Jurassic P fan
Jeanie makes a VELOCIRAPTOR FACE spitting out fake venom

ALICE
“Welcome to Jurassic Park”

JEANIE
“That is one big pile of shit”

Jeanie and Alice smile at each other mutual fans

ALICE
“Clever girl”

Jeanie nods impressed Sick reference
MIKE

I personally still like the
helicopter ride Going on record

TATIANA
Don’t you think we should do what
Jeanie wants to do Mike After

everyone happy

Jeanie’s BRIDESMAIDS party led by maid of honor BECKY walk

dinosaurs

BECKY
But it’s your wedding weekend You
need to get a mani pedi

JEANIE

your toes this morning I’d say you
need one more than I do

Everyone cracks up at Becky who goes red with embarrassment

BECKY
I wore open-toed shoes on the
plane They scrunched up my feet

Becky storms away The other Bridesmaids follow her

JEANIE
I’m sorry Becky
(to Alice)
I’m not really sorry She’s driving
me up the fucking wall Let’s go

EXT DIRT TRAILS - DAY
Mike Dave Tatiana Alice and Jeanie are all on ATVs

wearing big helmets and weaving through the grass and dirt
It feels like the set of Jurassic Park -- because it was

ALICE
This is it Where all the dinos
were running across the prairie

Tatiana GUNS the ATV across the grass going over bumps She
stands up takes the bumps like a professional ATV rider

TATIANA
Check it out I’m a brontosaurus

ALICE
I’m a T-Rex coming after you

They weave in and out of each other having a ball

EXT DIRT TRAILS - LATER

They pull up to a ridge with a HUGE HILL Mike holds up his
hand alerting the group

MIKE
This hill looks pretty steep guys
Let’s traverse over this way

ALICE
Yeah Mike’s totally right we don’t
want to go over this hill too fast
it could be super dangerous
(then yelling)
SUCK MY CLIT FUCKERS

Alice GUNS her ATV drives at the hill at top speed She hits
a jump FLIES THROUGH THE AIR and sticks the landing She
skids to a halt a large plume of dust around her

DAVE
Holy shit Alice You see that
Mike She got some serious air

TATIANA
You call that air Check this shit
out

Tatiana CRANKS the handle GUNS her ATV off the jump In
MIDAIR she turns to the guys takes her hands off the
handlebars and smiles

Mike and Dave watch her in awe She STICKS the landing
MIKE

What the fuck Where did you learn
to do that

TATIANA
Alice and I lived in Baja Mexico
for four years Tore up a lot of
trails down there Made some
friends made even more enemies

ALICE
God I miss Baja

TATIANA
OK your turn Stangel Boys

Mike and Dave look at each clearly not wanting to go

MIKE
Do it up Dave Your honor

DAVE
No way you’re the older brother
It’s clearly your turn

MIKE

DAVE

TATIANA
What’s the matter You guys afraid

Tatiana and Alice stifle a laugh as Mike and Dave burn

MIKE
Afraid Why would I be afraid
Who’s afraid How could I be
afraid What would I be afraid of
Tell me exactly I’m curious What
exactly am I afraid of

TATIANA
Stop stalling

MIKE
I’m not stalling If I was stalling
Id take a really long time hoping
something would intervene and make
it so I didn’t have to do it But
that’s clearly not going to happen
right now Ahhh Fuck this

Mike CRANKS the gas of the ATV guns it toward the jump As

soon as he goes off the jump the ATV FLIES out of his hands
and he flails in mid-air trying to pull it back toward him

Mike falls to the ground LANDS hard on his back

The ATV lands ahead of him BOUNDS down a hill right toward
Jeanie who tries to jump out of the way -- only every time
the ATV hits the ground it changes direction

The ATV lands on Jeanie knocking her to the ground and

RUNS OVER JEANIE’S FACE

INT BURT AND ROSIE’S ROOM - DAY

Jeanie sits in front of the mirror a bag of ice covering
half of her face Maid of honor Becky looks on in horror

BECKY
It’s fine Jeanie You can’t tell

Jeanie takes off the bag of ice revealing a CRAZY SCRAPE on
the other side of her face Everyone reacts

MIKE
Good god Jesus

BECKY
Mike Shut up

DAVE
It’s not that bad Jeanie You just
need to face one way during photos
and you’1ll never be able to tell

Jeanie starts to cry Eric comforts her

ERIC

JEANIE
Shut the fuck up about the pig
Eric I don’t care “When the
thermometer hits 170 degrees we’re
gonna have a fucking pig to eat”
Just shut up

ERIC
I know you’re upset about your
face but don’t be mean Sweetie
Barbecue isn’t just a hobby it’s a
passion

Burt and Rosie enter Burt points at Mike and Dave
BURT
You two In the hall Now

Mike and Dave walk out to the hallway Rosie stops

ROSIE
Honey You need to cool down first
You take it so personally and I
don’t want you to get hot

BURT
They deformed our little girl the
day before her goddamn wedding She
looks like Seal She’s ruined

From across the room Jeanie lets out a wail
BURT (CONTD)
Jeanie I’m not talking about you

I’m talking about the singer Seal
and how his last record got ruined

INT BURT’S HOTEL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Burt

Burt reams out Mike and Dave who are very defensive

MIKE
The real issue is those ATVs are
super dangerous Shame on that
company for allowing us to rent
them without proper training

BURT
Oh no Don’t do what you always do
don’t deflect blame You’ve got to
own this This is your fault

MIKE
Youre not pinning this one on us
It’s those girls They’re batshit
crazy

DAVE
Mike’s telling the truth You
should have seen them out there A
danger to themselves and others
Reckless

MIKE
That’s a good word to use Dave
Reckless And we hear you loud and
clear Dad

(MORE )
MIKE (CONTD)
Weve had it up to here with these
girls and we’re kicking them out of
here

BURT
The girls aren’t the problem I
spoke to Tatiana she seems like a
down-to-earth clever sensible
girl And Jeanie can’t stop raving
about Alice she thinks the world
of her

MIKE
You believe that bullshit Cause
Tatiana kissed your ass and likes
the same cheesesteak as you

BURT
No she liked a different
cheesesteak and wasn’t afraid to
disagree with me I respect that

MIKE
So we’re not allowed to kick them
out of the wedding

BURT
Kick them out If I had to choose
two people to kick out of here it
would be you two bozos

MIKE
But you’re the one who told us to
bring dates

BURT
Cause I wanted you to behave like
normal human beings

MIKE
We are normal We’re super cool
fun guys You lucked out so hard
getting Dave and me as your kids
but instead you treat us like
garbage Would it kill you one time
to say you’re proud of us

Burt sighs frustrated Mike waits for his response

MIKE (CONTD)
Well Are you gonna say it

BURT
Say what

MIKE
That you’re proud of us

BURT
Right now No Cause I’m not proud
of you What is wrong with you

INT MIKE AND DAVE’S ROOM - DAY
Dave lays on the bed while Mike paces fuming

DAVE
Maybe Dad’s got a very small teeny
tiny point

MIKE
Which is what exactly

DAVE
Maybe this is our fault He told us
to be cool and we brought a
shitstorm to the wedding

MIKE
We didn’t know it was gonna be a
shitstorm We thought they were
perfect But they’re a couple of
hot messes What the hell is wrong
with Tatiana She’s starting
fights doing ATV stunts like she’s
in the fucking X Games Why am I
worried about her We should be
thinking about crushing our speech
tomorrow God I hate her

DAVE
Are you just mad that she won’t
hook up with you

MIKE
No But it is a little rude I’m
trying so hard But she shuts me
down every time

DAVE
Maybe she’s not interested

MIKE
Why would she come to a wedding
with me if she wasn’t interested
It just doesn’t make any sense

DAVE
I kind of feel bad for Alice She
keeps saying she’s having fun but
it doesn’t seem like she is
underneath You know

MIKE
You know who I feel bad for Us
These girls totally misrepresented
themselves This is not what I
signed up for I chose her Dave I
chose her

Mike starts punching the bed Dave watches concerned

DAVE
I know man It’s gonna be OK Shh

Dave pats Mike on the back and Mike looks up calmer

MIKE
Thanks I needed that

DAVE
I know you did bud

INT HALLWAY - LATER
Mike stands in the doorway talks to Tatiana who is put out

TATIANA
I just don’t understand what you’re
trying to say Mike

MIKE
Can I come in I don’t want to have
this conversation in the hallway

TATIANA
No Let’s talk out here

MIKE
Fine A little weird you won’t let
me in but OK All I’m saying is
youre my date This is my sister’s
wedding And I just want you to be
cool and be my date and you know
hold up your end of the bargain

Tatiana puts her hand on her hip getting heated

TATIANA
My “end of the bargain”

MIKE
I just mean behavelike you’re
supposed to behave

TATIANA
So you invite me to a wedding I’m
supposed to fuck you is that it
Did I forget to give you your
“welcome to the wedding” blow-job
Oh How rude of me

MIKE
No Of course not I’m not gonna
lie I would have accepted that a
day ago But I don’t even want to
have sex with you anymore I just
want you out of my life

TATIANA
You know what you are You’re a
hater And you know what I say
Fuck the haters I am a guest at
this wedding Mike Not your lap

I feel like THIS IS MY VACATION

MIKE

Tatiana SLAMS the door in Mike’s face He POUNDS on the door
MIKE (CONTD)

about I don’t see anybody

Tatiana giving cousin Gary a
handjob in the steam room

MIKE

DAVE

Just Mom and Dad have literally
said word for word about you or me
what you just said about Tatiana
You said they were the female uses--

MIKE
Well if they are the female uses

Dave nods at this an idea dawning on him

DAVE
But that would mean we suck Think
about it If we give Mom and Dad
even half the grief these girls
have been giving us we’ve got to
be a nightmare to deal with Right

Mike thinks this over a beat then shakes his head

MIKE
Fuuuuuck that We’re nothing like
these girls Tatiana’s like a
sociopath There’s a screw loose

DAVE
Look we can’t change the girls’
behavior Let’s just focus on how
we can help the situation We
should chill out go easy on Mom
and Dad and try not to be giant
pains in everyone’s asses

MIKE
So this is my fault I’m not the
one who jerked off Cousin Gary
(MORE)

MIKE (CONTD)
Or maybe it was me you couldn’t
see behind all that steam but I was
going to town

Mike mimes jerking off Gary makes disgusting faces licks
Garys balls then his asshole Dave is grossed out

DAVE
Stop it Why are you doing that

MIKE

Just stop Mike You’re such a
drama king

MIKE
Oh you’re right I’m totally
overreacting When someone invites
you to a wedding you obviously
hook up with their family members

heard there’s a glory hole in the
second floor bathroom You should
get going I don’t want you to be
late for your shift

TATIANA
Screw you I’m a grown woman I can
jerk off whomever I want

MIKE
Oh congratulations The women of
the suffrage movement must be so
proud of your “accomplishments”

TATIANA
Don’t judge me you prick It was
an honest handjob It means
nothing It’s like shaking
someone’s hand That’s why they
call it rubbing one out

It’s like getting a stain off a
sweater wax on wax off it’s no
big deal
(doing British accent)

saw Luke having very rough sex

with

Samantha one of my bridesmaids and

best friends on the hood of a

Tesla Roadster I’1ll never forget
it Her butt was right above the

logo

DAVE
Oh man Oh god That is crazy

So

insane person all weekend

ALICE

something to do with it

Alice starts crying softly and Dave gives her a hug

DAVE
Why didn’t you just tell me

ALICE
Because I was worried you were

have

gonna think I was damaged goods

DAVE

but not everything’s my fault
Would it kill you to have my back
one time Just once

Someone behind Mike yells at the top of his lungs

SOMEONE

A HORSE CRASHES through the glass window in the lobby
Everyone watches in shock as the frightened horse bucks
like crazy taking out tables chandeliers the whole bar

trailing behind him Then everyone watches in horror as
another horse (the one digging at the beach) DRAGS a still-

smoldering PIG CARCASS across the patio -- leaving a huge
streak of blood -- and into the pool
ERIC

Not the pig It was gonna be so
good Crispy on the outside moist
on the inside Sweet and spicy It
was gonna be the hit of the
wedding

Everyone watches the pig bob in the water grossed out

COUSIN GARY
That is the grossest thing I’ve
ever seen Oh no I’m gonna shit

Gary runs off holding his mouth and his butt The pig starts
taking in water puffs out It starts splitting apart
exposing its insides It’s truly disgusting

DAVE
I can’t believe it’s come to this

MIKE
Dave I’ve been doing some thinking

DAVE
You’re right man We suck so hard

MIKE

responsibility That’s on me

MIKE
Bro it’s on me

INT TATIANA AND ALICE’S ROOM - SAME TIME
Tatiana and Alice are packing up in silence

say fuck the haters but aren’t we
haters We hate on a bunch of
stuff

TATIANA
But the stuff we hate on sucks

ALICE
But what if we’re wrong Cause it
kinda seems like the stuff we hate
on is the stuff some people really
love That makes us haters And if
were saying fuck the haters then
aren’t we really saying fuck us

Tatiana looks at Alice for a long beat impressed

TATIANA
Whoa Alice That was deep And
super logical

ALICE
I like partying and getting great
tans but I’m starting to think
there’s more to life than that

TATIANA
Normally Id say shut your fucking
face you dumb bitch but you might
be right We just destroyed a
wedding You drugged the bride

ALICE
She took it willingly And we had a
lot of fun

(MORE)
ALICE (CONTD)
Until Blinky jumped through the
window and the pig exploded

TATIANA
I had nightmares about that pig I
never want to eat pig again I
think I’m going to be kosher

ALICE
Are we bad people

TATIANA
We don’t have to be

EXT HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

faults Right Mike

Mike softens knows he can’t fight it

MIKE
God you’re right Look I know I
seem like some super put-together
guy whose got it all figured out
but the truth isI’m not

An awkward beat Dave shoots a look at Tatiana and Alice
urging them to respond

TATIANAALICE
OhReallyThat’s surprising

MIKE
The real Mike is vain Selfish
Insecure I crave the attention and
acceptance of my family and used
you to gain it And for that I say
I’m sorry I’m the worst

DAVE
But we don’t have to be the worst
We can do something This wedding’s
not dead yet

MIKE
I don’t know They’re fishing a pig
carcass out of the pool everyones
leaving for the airport Jeanie and
Eric aren’t even talking to each
other It’s over man

TATIANA
No Dave’s right We can’t let this
wedding die Not without a fight

ALICE
What the hell are we gonna do The
airport bus is pulling away

The Airport bus with all the guests inside drives down the
driveway toward the hotel exit Dave’s eyes narrow

DAVE
Not on my watch

Dave runs into the parking lot then SLIDES ACROSS THE HOOD
of Gary’s sports car He opens the door hops in

ALICE
Wow Look at Dave go

GARY
Hey That’s my car

DAVE
Don’t worry I’ll be right back

Dave REVS the engine and races alongside of the bus at a
crazy high speed Right before the bus pulls out of the exit
Dave CUTS OFF the bus which skids to a halt

Dave CRASHES into a stone pillar and wobbles out of the car
unsteady

DAVE (CONT’D)
Stop Stop everyone

The guests get off the bus The BUSDRIVER yells at Dave

BUSDRIVER
What the hell were you doing You

DAVE
I needed to get you to stop

BUSDRIVER

onto the hood of Gary’s crashed car

me Me What I mean is I’ve been
like this the whole time Everyone
thinks I’m sweet simple Dave but
I’m not I’m complicated

Once everyone is quiet Dave nods

DAVE (CONTD)
The bottom line is this wedding
weekend has not gone well And I’m
here to tell you it’s my fault
I’m a pushover And I allow my
brother to convince me to go
against my better judgment That’s
me That’s my bag

MIKE
It’s also my fault I put an ad on
Craigslist to find strangers to
bring to a wedding I was vain and
craved your approval I still do
Also I poisoned Cousin Gary

Everyone gasps reacts to this insane news

GARY
I knew it See everyone I wasn’t
lying I’m pressing charges bitch
You are all witnesses

MIKE
I’m really sorry about that Gary
Totally my bad It looks really
harmless in movies to poison
someone but as it turns out it’s
really serious Do not try it

DAVE
But it’s not just me and Mike’s
fault It’s everyone’s Dad Mom
Cousin Gary we all play a part We
spend so much time blaming each
other and no one listens

TATIANA
Us too Alice and I have done
terrible things at this wedding

MIKE
Please don’t list the things you’ve
done at this wedding Just stop

good ideas but I’ve got an idea

depression it’s very common

GLADYS
It’s true I’m super bummed today
But I’m also happy because

I guess I just feel more open

FRANK

ROSIE
That was actually kinda cool what
you did in the parking lot Caused
a diversion blocked the exit

DAVE
Yeah thanks Mom

ROSIE
No it was really something You
took command The hood slide was
badass too I’m sorry I called you
a pussy David

DAVE
It’s OK I am sometimes

Dave turns away quickly wipes away tears so Rosie can’t see

EXT FIELD — DAY

Burt inspects tables yelling at someone on the phone

BURT
-And if you think I’m paying
retail prices for this you’re out
of your mind They’re just flowers
They die in two days Why would
that make them more expensive

Alice runs up to Burt holding giant bouquets of flowers We
can see she clearly ripped them out of someone’s garden
There’s dirt all over her face

BURT (CONTD)
Where did you get those

ALICE
I stole them from the hotel

BURT
Thank you

INT STABLES - SAME TIME

The horse trainer finishes feeding Blinky walks past a stall
in the barn sees Aunt Gladys and Uncle Frank having intense
kinky sex Uncle Frank wears a horse saddle The trainer
closes the stall door disgusted

EXT FIELD — DAY

Jeanie and Eric get married in a field with a big abandoned
barn Mike reads a passage from Maya Angelou Dave presides

There is hay and animals and it’s pretty dirty but everyone
is having a good time A local band plays Guests drink keg
beer and eat barbecue Aunt Gladys spots her underwear in the
hay hurriedly picks it up and stuffs it in her pocket

Off to the side Alice and Dave stand together talking
intimately

ALICE
Tatiana said this was gonna happen
and I totally didn’t believe her
But you got my groove back You are
my Taye Diggs

DAVE
Thank you I don’t know who that
is but thank you Listen I like
you a lot But I don’t think you
and me is a good idea

ALICE
That’s too bad because I kind of
want to spend every waking moment
with you from now on And I think
you do too

Dave is torn

DAVE
Yeah but I’m like basically in the
process of breaking away from my
brother Won’t that be just jumping
from one fucked up relationship
into another

ALICE
Yeah

Dave considers then he and Alice MAKE OUT like crazy

DAVE
Youre so crazy I want to be crazy
with you

ALICE

Oh yeah I want to bury your crazy
in the dirt and water it and grow
tomatoes on it

DAVE
That doesn’t make sense you’re so
crazy But I love that

INT BARN - LATER

Everyone is having a good time Burt stands by the door
surveying the scene happy He spots Tatiana across the room
running around working hard filling Champagne glasses She
empties the bottle looks around for another one when--

Burt hands her another bottle They uncork them together
walk around the party filling everyone’s glass

TATIANA
This is your daughter’s wedding
You shouldn’t be filling glasses

BURT
It’s been a pretty wild wedding
Whatever gets the job done

TATIANA
Look Burt I haven’t been fully
honest this weekend Like remember
when I said I hadn’t seen the
Craigslist ad and wasn’t here for a
free trip to Hawaii All of that
was not true

BURT
OK Thank you for telling me the
truth

TATIANA

It wasn’t all a lie I am from
Philly and I do prefer Geno’s to
Pat’s and that will never change
unless Pat decides to go easier on
those onions We get it Enough
with the onions

BURT
You can order easy onions I do it
all the time

Burt and Tatiana nod at each other coming to some kind of
understanding Tatiana points to Mike who sits alone
watching everyone dance a bemused smile on his face

TATIANA
You got a good kid there

BURT
Yeah I know

TATIANA
No really He’s awesome

BURT
Yes I know that He’s my son

TATIANA
I totally know it’s not my place to
say this but maybe you should tell
him sometime

BURT
You don’t know Mike He doesn’t
care what I think Never has

TATIANA
Everyone wants their dad to approve
of them Didn’t you want that from
your dad

BURT
Yeah Never got it The day he died
I told him “I love you Dad” He
said “Make sure you take care of
my dog”

Burt is getting emotional but masks it Tatiana gives Burt a
hug kisses him on the cheek He blushes a little bit

Thanks for inviting me to your
wedding You have a lovely family
