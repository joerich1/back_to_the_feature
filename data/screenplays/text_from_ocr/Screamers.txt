SPACE WE SPEED TOWARD SIRIUS 6B a huge mining planet
suspended in a veil of smoke

SUPERIMPOSE OPENING CRAWL

2058 Mining Colony Sirius 6B For ten years
war has raged across several solar systens On one
side is the NEB Organization a vast powerful
corporation which controls mining operations on
almost every planet explored by man At war with
them is the Alliance a federation of mine workere
and geoscientists who have revolted and taken

control of several NEB planets

This conflict has now reached a final confrontation
on Sirius 6B NEBs most important territory
Devastated by every known weapon Sirius 6B is

now faced with a new threat beyond imagination

TITLE FADES UP
8 C R BAM E R 8B

The planets orbit is clogged with a junkyard of wrecked space
weapons and satellites The shape of its oceans and continents
drastically altered by ravaged coastlines and brand new inland
seas WE PASS THROUGH THE SCRAP -- A man made satellite ORBITS
toward us As it nears we can see that it is a CREMATED WRECK
Fragments of debris follow gracefully in its wake
circumnavigating the globe with it -- and pursuing it with the
relentless futility of a creditor is the burned and blackened

corpse of a space-suited man his TEETH gleaming like pearls
impeddea in asphalt

EXTERIOR - PLANET SURFACE DAY

A landscape of utter devastation

Gray DUST and shattered debris from horizon to horizon Under a
hot blue sun

A twisted FLAGPOLE and on it an ALLIANCE flag FLAPS like an old
shirt in the wind

Apart from the flag and the ash nothing moves No life The wind
moans

GUNSIGHT on a rifle

A SOLDIER peering through it
Nasty slimy hand-rolled cigarette dangling from his lips
HE SEES (THROUGH HIS ELECTRONIC GUNSIGHT)

«The ragged crest of a RIDGE and STANDING warily on it
An ENEMY SOLDIER

Holding his gun ready in gloved hands the ENEMY INFANTRY-MAN
studies the terrain carefully and uneasily

RIFLEMAN IN PILLBOX
Do you want him oOrcan I have him

This little favor is being asked of his BUDDY in the pillbox who
also -- through a pair of high-powered field glasses -- is
studying the hapless enemy soldier

SOLDIER wFIELD GLASSES
Hes all yours

As they continue their prurient surveillance the ENEMY SOLDIER
starts down the hill He begins to hurry sliding in the gray
ash trying to keep his gun up

Our rifleman (SERGEANT LEONE) keeps the advancing footsoldier
squarely in his crosshairs but holds his fire His companion
with the binoculars (LIEUTENANT MELENDEZ) is getting edgy

MELENDEZ
What are you waiting for
LEONE
How far do you think hell get

MELENDEZ
Maybe another ten yards if you
let him Why

‘

LEONE
Think hell make it to the bottom
of the hill

MELENDEZ
Probably not No Why

LEONE ¢
Ill bet he makes it to the barbed
wire

MELENDEZ
He wont

LEONE

Want to put fifty on that

MELENDEZ
Just get it over with for
Christs sake Hes about
to get to the bad part

LEONE
You can close your eyes if
you want to

Now the enemy soldier is only a few meters from the bottom of the
Slope He stops for a moment raising binoculars of his own

LEONE
That bastard is looking right at me

It is eerie each man peering into the others telescopically
magnified FACE He knows that I know that he knows that I see
him seeing me

The soldiers binoculars black and glassy and huge conceal his
EYES from Leones fascinated stare But his mouth is
expressively tight and determined behind twin plumes of steam
squirting from cold red nostrils He needs a shave On one bony

‘Cheek is a square of tape with something green growing behind it

His gloves and coat are mud-caked and torn
MELENDEZ
the (a moan)
Oh my God here it comes

A DREADFUL MECHANICAL SCREECH and across the ground comes
something SMALL and METALLIC Flashing in the dull sunlight
Treads flying SCREAMING like a banshee it races up the hill
toward the foreign soldier CLAWS spring out two razor
projections spinning in a blur of white STEEL The enemy soldier
HEARS it Turns instantly FIRING The little machine EXPLODES
hurling lethal pieces of honed blade for yards

But already a SECOND SHRIEKING MACHINE has made its appearance
The soldier squeezes off two quick rounds Too fast - both

shots miss The mobile buzz saw keeps coming The man is not
easily panicked he steadies himself aims carefully and BLOWS
it into shards of glitter But it is an exercise in heroic

futility Reinforcements -- more squalling little steel things --
are arriving in force

He knows it is the end -- TURNS toward the men in the bunker and
THROWS HIS ARM HIGH like a salute of defiance --- in his hand
something GLINTS catching the light from the sun He SHOUTS
just as a device leaps onto the tail of his coat screaming like
Dy a sawmill and shredding his clothes on its way up to his head It
f hops to his shoulder The whirling blades disappear into his
neck cutting off his shout Spraying blood like a headless
te chicken he goes down One by one the little machines shut off
their noisemakers leaving a ringing silence

LEONE
You should have taken the bet
MELENDEZ
(reproachfully)
You could have put him away with
one shot
LEONE

“So could you

Lt Melendez is well aware of his own lack of resolve Grumbling
he changes the subject

MELENDEZ
(sullenly)
Those god damn things give me
the creeps

4 LEONE
poo If we hadnt invented them they
would have
MELENDEZ
“Why does everybody keep saying that

MELENDEZ lights a cigarette with shaking hands Everybody is
smoking a cigarette at all times in this filn

LEONE
I wonder why an NEB soldier would
come all this way alone

Up from a concrete tunnel into the pillbox comes CAPTAIN ELBARAK
the bunkers Executive Officer An affable sort Well liked

CAPT ELBARAK
What was that

LEONE
NEB soldier

CAPT ELBARAK
Just one

Lt MELENDEZ hands him the field glasses Elbarak peers through
them and sees °

THROUGH THE BINOCS a swarm of little gleaming machines crawl
over the prostrate body of the NEB soldier Clicking and whirring
contentedly they saw him into small bits which they carry away

CAPT ELBARAK
What a lot of screamers

LEONE
Not much game for them anymore

CAPT ELBARAK
Like flies

Elbarak pushes the sight away disgusted

CAPT ELBARAK
What a place for an NEB to take a
walk Was he trying to infiltrate us
Or did he just get lost
(shakes his head in wonderment)
Jesus howd he make it this far

LEONE
He didnt look lost to me

MELENDEZ
Did you see that thing he had in his hand
aps

CAPT ELBARAK
What thing

LEONE
I thought it was a grenade But he
didn’t throw it

MELENDEZ
He shouted something at us

LEONE
Yeah when he saw the sawblades
were going to kiss hin

CAPT ELBARAK
Shouted what

They shake their heads

MELENDEZ
Couldnt make it out

CAPT “ELBARAK
Wonderful The two sentries

LEONE
Hey come on Captain You know
you cant hear a fucking thing
when the screamers are serenading

What remains of the NEB soldier is being brought down the
hill-side by the host of screamers marching in a little line
like ants

LEONE
(peering through his
telescopic sight)
He sure had a lot of guts

CAPT ELBARAK
I guess Id better go see what I
can find

Elbarak goes to the pillbox door throws the bolt But first he
pauses and looks uneasily down at his wrist strapped to which is
a bulky metal bracelet Touches it as if it is a magic amulet
Then he throws the door open and steps out of the pillbox

LEONE
Watch yourself Cap Its probably
a bomb
Elbarak steps carefully out into the grimy sunlight Makes his
way between blocks of concrete and steel prongs twisted and
bent

The air is bitingly cold

He leaves behind him puffs of his breath as he walks

He strides rapidly across the soft ash to the rapidly dwindling
NEB The now-silent screamers retreat as he approaches some of
them stiffening into immobility Unconsiously his hand steals to
his bracelet

He crouches by what remains of the NEB A wind blows around the
dead man swirling gray particles up into Elbaraks face After a
moment he finds what he is looking for a metal cylinder about
the size of a cigar tube

It is clutched in the fingers of a glove

He picks up the glove it is heavy and the fingers clenched
tight

A sharp tug is required to separate the cylinder before he hurls
the glove away

Printed along the side of the tube in eye-grabbing atomic red
is the following pulse-quickener

CRUCIAL TO ALLIANCE COMMANDER CRUCIAL

INTERIOR - COLONEL HENDRICKSSONS OFFICE DAY
No windows A lot of concrete Gloomy

Elbarak stands before COLONEL JOSEPH HENDRICKSSON Commanding
Officer ALLIANCE Forward Command West He is young for the job
-- maybe 30 or 40 Battlefield promotions have thrust him into
command in spite of his relative youth

suspiciously he is eyeballing the cylinder Elbarak holds out to
him He leans away from it

HENDRICKSSON
He had that

ELBARAK
In his hand
Cautiously Hendricksson takes it from Elbarak

HENDRICKSSON
I hate surprises

ELBARAK
Its okay No boobytraps We
already opened it Here

Elbarak opens the tube for the reluctant Hendricksson and dumps
out the contents a single sheet of flimsy-but-tough metallic
paper Carefully rolled

ELBARAK
Nick I think this is what weve
been waiting for

Hendricksson reads it with no change of expression you wouldnt
want to play poker with him

HENDRICKSSON
What are they up to now

ELBARAK
Are we going along with him on this

Yr HENDRICKSSON
Not before I talk to the Bird Sanctuary

R ¢o NS ROOM - DAY
A HISSING TV SCREEN

Spec 5 Officer tuning the dials
Teasing a signal from the airwaves

Hendricksson and Elbarak stand watching The image clears and
becomes an ID pattern

VOICE FROM SCREEN
Hello Fort Apache this is FLEETSATCOM
ready to refeed and decode you to
CINCSANC Over

SPEC 5
Roger FLEETSATCOM this is FORCOMWEST
Fort Apache reading you loudest and
standing by to transcieve Go ahead
Over

Hendricksson steps closer to the screen The image of 60-year-old
GENERAL KATO NUYEN Commander-in-Chief of combined ALLIANCE
forces at Sanctuary (whatever and wherever that is)
materializes on the TV monitor His cleanliness alertness and
crispness of uniform are almost obscene by comparison with the
weary mildewed zombies in the bunker

GEN NUYEN
Yes Joe

HENDRICKSSON
(cant waste precious air time)
General the screamers retired a single
NEB runner who penetrated our lines
He was carrying a message from my
opposite number -- the CO at their
forward command post

GEN NUYEN
What message

HENDRICKSSON

(reads)
FROMMARSHAL RICHARD COOPER
SUPREME COMMANDER
STH NEB ARMY
FORWARD COMMAND
TO COLONEL JOSEF HENDRICKSSON
COMMANDING OFFICER
ALLIANCE FORWARD COMMAND
WESTERN ARMY GROUP

MATTERS OF GRAVEST COMPELLING
URGENCY MAKE IMPERATIVE IMMEDIATE
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES
OF ALLIANCE FORCES AND OURSELVES WITH
NO OPTION FOR DELAY WHATSOEVER
PLEASE SEND TWO OFFICERS AT POLICY
LEVEL SAFE PASSAGE GUARANTEED

YOUR ARRIVAL AWAITED EXPECTANTLY

GEN NUYEN
Thats all They dont say what
these discussions are supposed to
be about

HENDRICKSSON
Matters of gravest compelling urgency

GEN NUYEN
That could be anything from a
revolution to a grain shortage

Hendricksson holds up the piece of paper for the General to see

HENDRICKSSON
On the back side is this map of their
forward command post It matches our
own intelligence pretty closely but
in the kind of detail youd give your
left ball for They must be cooking
up a choice one to hand out this
kind of info

GEN NUYEN
Hells bells What was that part
about policy making

HENDRICKSSON
Send two officers at policy level

GEN NUYEN
Maybe this guy is acting on his
own initiative We havent heard a
word from their headquarters I mean
that literally their comsats have gone
completely silent for almost a day

HENDRICKSSON
I didnt know that

GEN NUYEN
You would if you could afford to keep
your radio on They fell silent 20
hours ago They must be in deep shit
(pause)
Maybe the screamers have done the job

HENDRICKSSON
To me it just sounds like a set-up
Another of their cheap sadistic tricks

GEN NUYEN
Cheap it is not Its paralyzing their
entire communications network

HENDRICKSSON
General I guarantee you Whoever
goes theyre going to nail his ass
to the barn wall

GEN NUYEN

Be that as it may we are going
to take their bait Because there
is a flimsy chance it might be
legitimate Hell I no longer even
Care very much who wins as long as

wins A peace
from the NEBs So go find
out what they want Joe Maybe we can
preserve some specimen of human life in
the future You have my full authority
and support

HENDRICKSSON
(snorts in derision)
Support Dont I wish Three rifles
from the Crimean war and a case of
firecrackers and where the hel are
those troops 7

GEN NUYEN
They havent arrived

HENDRICKSSON
No sir they have not

GEN NUYEN
Those worthless transports Let me
know the instant theyre down safely
or otherwise

HENDRICKSSON

INTERIOR - CORRIDORS DAY

Hendricksson and Elbarak walking Black mood on Hendricksson

NOTE that there are no windows in this underground warren Just
a lot of concrete)

HENDRICKSSON
Its been what a year since
we started using the screamers

ELBARAK
Something like that

HENDRICKSSON

Have you seen the new ones
ELBARAK

What new ones
HENDRICKSSON

The ones with the chain saws
ELBARAK

No-
HENDRICKSSON

One of them got into an NEB bunker last
week It got almost half a platoon of
them before they pulled its plug

ELBARAK
Be glad theyre on our side

HENDRICKSSON
Dont worry theyll have their own soon

ELBARAK
Maybe they wont last long enough

HENDRICKSSON
Sure

They walk into the canteen
- NOW W

There are some ALLIANCE Soldiers lounging around eating gabbing
Playing cards For the most part they are a mixed bunch of
troops from assorted planet colonies They all look weary The
air hangs heavy with blue cigarette smoke a choking haze that
makes near objects recede into a gauzy distance Discipline
seems casual in the bunker

Hendricksson and Elbarak walk in Elbarak gets a can from a
dispenser and they find seats at a table by themselves

oO Hendricksson watches Elbarak pop the can open and tilt it back
HENDRICKSSON
(watching him)
T hate that crap

‘ ELBARAK
You hate everything

HENDRICKSSON
It tastes like something youd clean
out a drain with

ELBARAK
If you knock it back fast enough
you can fool yourself

HENDRICKSSON
The last thing I want to do is
fool myself

ELBARAK
The alcohol is real
— HENDRICKSSON
Sw Yes and what a wonderful flavor

( the amoeba impart

Hendricksson looks at his watch actually a complex panel of
readouts strapped to his wrist) He fishes a couple of red
cigarettes from his pocket and passes one to Elbarak Both light
up and start puffing Hendricksson gazes around the foggy kennel
full of armpit-scratchers Everyone in the room is
chain-smoking including those who are eating

EENDRICKSSON
Lookit em eat that snot

ELBARAK
Nick you eat it too

HENDRICKSSON
I eat it straight Baked
soybeans and steamed algae
Not dressed up to look like some kind
of mildewed hamburger or phony greenbean
Or that so-called coffee You know
where they get the caffeine from
Chickenshit thats where Brewed
soybeans with chickenshit

ELBARAK

Oh its not so bad It grows on you
HENDRICKSSON

You can say that again It grows on

anything

ELBARAK
Arent we Saint Nicholas today

HENDRICKSSON
I like things that are real

ELBARAK
Expensive hobby these days
(drinks)
I do miss trees though Promise me
if you ever get to someplace where
there are trees youll plant one
for me

HENDRICKSSON
Plant it yourself

ELBARAK
No I mean if I dont make it

HENDRICKSSON
If I saw a tree Id eat it

From the next table Leone leans over from his winning poker hand
to ask

LEONE
Hey Skipper -- are the NEBs really
surrendering

HENDRICKSSON
What do you think

A SOLDIER
Is it true the warll be over by
Christmas

HENDRICKSSON
Maybe Which Christmas

Suddenly the Spec 5 Communications officer comes running in
wild-eyed

COM OFFICER
Skipper theres a Chicken Coop
coming down hard and fast

A LOUD CLAXON SIREN begins to sound Everybody jumps to their
feet Hendricksson charges out of the canteen down the hall up
some steps and outdoors

EXTERIOR LANDING STRIP DAY

Men are running around Down the runway a huge flimsylooking
SHUTTLECRAFT has CRASHED and lies in ruins like a broxen
Gragonfly A rolling cloud of gray dust extends behind it for
some distance tracing the crash path

(These shuttles are single-use gliders designed for a one-way
trip from space They are dropped from orbit and make an
wnpowered descent and landing Then they are discarded They are
cheap The one we are looking at has come apart and is spread
out along the runway for a hundred yards like crates of chickens
thrown from a truck)

Hendricksson has seen it all before He runs to the wreckage

HENDRICKSSON
Anybody alive in there

Pandemonium Medics run from body to body

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Any survivors

AN ARM emerges from a piece of fuselage and waves

VOICE
Me Here Help ne

Hendricksson runs toward the arm It is attached to a very YOUNG
SOLDIER who lies pinned under the wreckage Hendricksson kneels
by him His arm is bleeding

HENDRICKSSON
Are you hurt

YOUNG SOLDIER
Just trapped thats all sir

HENDRICKSSON
Lets have some help here Get this
man free

Other soldiers come running

Meanwhile attracted by all the activity the screamers --the
little killing machines - are hovering around the edges of the
action keeping a respectful distance

HENDRICKSSON
How about your arm there

YOUNG SOLDIER
(panting eyes panicky)
Im not hurt Im just stuck if
you can just get this off me sir

While he is examining the trapped soldiers injured arm he
notices the boys wrist

HENDRICKSSON
Wheres your jammer

TRAPPED SOLDIER
My what sir

HENDRICKSSON
Your jammer Your goddamned transponder

TRAPPED SOLOIER
I dont think I have one sir

HENDRICKSSON
Oh my God Give me some goddamn help
this man hasnt got a transponder

Suddenly the nearest screamer starts WAILING and darts on a
beeline toward the trapped soldier Hendricksson hauls off and
Kicks it It flies through the air like a soccer ball

The soldiers who are lifting the debris clear of the pinned boy
cluster around him making themselves into a human wall between
him and the milling screamers which are starting to screech up a
storm

HENDRICKSSON
Get this stuff off him

Hurriedly they lift away the last of the debris Immediately
the boy jumps to his feet

Keeping a tight circle around him they PICK HIM UP and carry hin
bodily to the bunker The screamers circle around them all the
way they want to get at the new soldier but they wont climb
the others to get at him

Near the bunker door the screamers drop back and their horns die
out one by one

INTERIOR BUNKER - DAY

The tight knot of men enters the bunker Instantly they slam the
door shut

All the men relax with loud gasps of relief They move clear of
the new arrival looking him over

HENDRICKSSON
(angrily)
Why arent you wearing a jammer

NEW SOLDIER
Sir I guess I dont know what one is

HENDRICKSSON
(he cant believe it)
What
Hendricksson holds up his own wrist and points to the BRACELET on
it

HENDRICKSSON
This is a jammer It keeps those things
outside from cutting you into beef jerky
and I want to know why the motherfucking
cocksucking sonuvabastardbitch they
sent you down here without one
Jesus H Christ Almighty shit

The young soldier is shaken
Hendricksson has vented his anger
Regains control of himself

- HENDRICKSSON
(pulse almost down to normal)
All right It wasnt your fault
How bad is your arm

Before he can answer the outer door bangs open and a SOLDIER
comes running down

SOLDIER
(out of breath)
Sir the screamers are cutting
up the bodies

HENDRICKSSON
Oh Jesus Christ
(to others)
Get this man outfitted with a jammer
immediately

Hendricksson runs up the cement steps and outside

DISSOLVE TO

Hendricksson is sitting at his desk He looks grim and tired In
front of him on the desktop are a couple dozen sets of dog tags
(military ID necklaces)

One by one he is picking up the tags comparing them with a
list copying some information from the tags onto the list and
dropping the tags into-a big manila envelope

A KNOCK on the door

HENDRICKSSON
Yeah come in

The door opens and in comes the Young Soldier the new arrival
His left hand and forearm are bandaged He stands very erect
On his wrist is a jammer

HENDRICKSSON
Hows that arm

NEW SOLDIER
Not bad sir Just a gash

HENDRICKSSON
Good In case you hadnt figured it
out yet Im Joe Hendricksson and
Im the C0 here Who the hell
are you

NEW SOLDIER
Private First Class Dov Mendelsohn
101st Regular Infantry 3rd Army
reporting for duty sir

From inside his tunic he plucks a thick envelope and thrusts it
into Hendrickssons unprepared hand like a nurse slapping a
scalpel into the palm of a surgeon

Then he salutes smartly —

A little too smartly for Hendricksson who returns the salute
like a man waving a fly out of his face He pulls Mendelsohns
papers out of the envelope and flips through them like junk mail
Some of them spill out on the desk

Dov is nonplussed doesnt the Colonel realize these are his

records

HENDRICKSSON
Why did you crash Or do you know

DOV

Sir we started taking hard snake
the minute we hit the troposphere
From there down to the surface they
never stopped hosing us

(tries to be professional but

his chin trembles)
We lost six men on the way down sir
It is a miracle we landed at all sir

HENDRICKSSON
Really oan

DOV
(blurts)
Sir if the lander were powered we
need not have crashed sir

-HENDRICKSSON
They always crash Those things are
no goddamn good

Dov
They could be made safe If they had
onboard computers and proper shielding
and arma--

HENDRICKSSON

If we had ham we could have ham and
eggs if we had eggs God damn it
what do you think this is Mendelsohn
1950 To do what youre talking about
takes resources You do not build a
space fleet out of 6 billion non-
biodegradable cigarette lighters

If you want something done about the
landers go get a hammer and nail and
do it yourself Now shut the fuck up

The outburst subdues both of them
Hendricksson returns to his dogtag cataloguing to avoid
Dovs eyes

DOV
(finally and very carefully)
eee Six the other men in my
outfit were there many

Hendricksson looks up at him In spite of a youngish face
Hendrickssons bloodshot eyes look about a thousand years old

HENDRICKSSON
Mendelsohn how old are you

DOV
Sir Fifteen
Hendricksson just looks at him How can anybody be that young

HENDRICKSSON
Do you have any idea what possessed
them to send you down here without
jammers

DOV
Well sir I guess things are
a little disorganized at the
- Sanctuary just now They told
us we would get whatever we needed
down here

HENDRICKSSON
They said that Did they bother to
mention the screamers

DOV
Sir of course Yessir they did

Hendricksson reaches under his desk and pulls something out
which he slams down in front of Dov CLANK ‘

HENDRICKSSON
This is your basic Type A screamer
“Dont worry its dead All the
guts yanked out

A grapefruit-sized sphere with complex individually suspended
wheels

Two arms and on them two articulated swivelling circular
sawblades like a cymbalist playing a pair of razor-edged
orchestral cymbals

On top some simple sensory apparatus and a big HORN
And a set of pliers for a face

HENDRICKSSON
The function should be pretty obvious
identify pursue swiftly over uneven
terrain then grab hold and start
sawing while making a noise like 200
dying pigs

Dov
Whats a pig

HENDRICKSSON
The screamers are one of the most
efficient instruments of war we have

Hendricksson twists it around and taps a small plate on the back
An identifying label

ALLIANCE DEPT OF DEFENSE
AUTONOMOUS MOBILE SWORD

HENDRICKSSON
“Autoswords they wanted to call then
It never caught on But whatever you
call it it just goes right ahead
and kills you if youre not wearing a
‘jammer Anybody without a jammer its
open season and toobad Charlie Get
the picture

DOV
Yes sir
Hendricksson studies him
HENDRICKSSON

How well do you know the other men
in your outfit
DOV
The other men Well sir we took our
basic training together A week at
Camp Justice

HENDRICKSSON
One week

DOV
Yes sir It was just about time
enough to get to know everyone
our outfit had only forty men in it

HENDRICKSSON
Now it has one

While this sinks in Hendricksson scrapes the remainde
dog tags into the envelope

OW 1

Hendricksson is standing before his assembled company

seventy-odd men

This gets a HUGE

HENDRICKSSON
Thanks to some 4-star loudmouths
most of you already know the NEBs
want us to go over to their lines
to talk turkey Im told it could
be a suspension of hostilities

CHEER

SOLDIER
Get some pussy while youre there

LEONE
Hey Skipper I want to end the war

as much as the next guy but why is

Murmurs

it us has to go to them If this
is so fucking important to then why
dont they come over here

Damn right

HENDRICKSSON
Because its probably a trick

r of the

Silence

HENDRICKSSON (CONT)
Or maybe the screamers have them
boxed in and they cant get out
Or maybe they dont trust us How should
I know shithead Besides you want the
NEBs creeping around here looking at
everything and putting time-bombs in the
toilet

End of that discussion

ELBARAK
Id like to come along No ones ever
seen the inside of an NEB bunker before

HENDRICKSSON
Elbarak if you could shoot worth a
damn Id take you in a second But
you cant and since Suaro bought it
I cant think of anybody who can

Dov shoots up his hand

EENDRICKSSON
Yes Mendelsohn

DOV
Sir I reached the 6th level
on the range at the Academy

HENDRICKSSON
You did

DOV
Yes sir

Hendricksson grins and tosses Dov his multi-rifle Caught
offguard Dov fumbles with the rifle and drops it to the floor
with a resounding CLATTER

Smirks and cutting comments from the troops

Suddenly Dov picks up the rifle spins it into a firing position
and shoots a series of bullets at a RAT feeding in the corner
He chases the rat in a path of bullets straight to a rat trap
which springs shut and kills the rat with a dying SQUEAL
General cries of All right Nice shootin’ kid from the
troops

Hendricksson smiles and retrieves his smoldering rifle from Dov

HENDRICKSSON
All right Ill buy that
Youre on Mendelsohn

DOV
Thank you sir

LEONE
Me too Chief

HENDRICKSSON
No Trigger-Happy The invitations
only for two

- UI -

Hendricksson and Dov are putting the finishing touches on their
outfits full combat gear -- 80 pounds of clothing and armaments
in shades of ‘camouflage gray Elbarak and a couple of others are
helping then

Elbarak is adjusting Dovs jammer Dovwinces with pain

ELBARAK
That codes it to your biosignature
permanently From now on it wont
work for anybody but you That way
the NEBs cant use it if they take
it off your body

HENDRICKSSON
Reassuring thought huh Mendelsohn
(to Elbarak)

Elbarak if I miss a transmission

dont come after us Call General

Nuyen so he can start doing nothing
about it If you cant get through
to him right away well it doesnt
really matter Just move into my -

office and carry on And watch out
for the NEBs imitating ny voice

ELBARAK
Id still like to come along Id
like to see if its true they have
women

HENDRICKSSON
I need you here If they have women
Ill try to trade Yo-yo here for one

ELBARAK
You take care of yourself Nick
you hear

HENDRICKSSON

You do the sane
Their friendship goes way back

HENDRICKSSON
(checks his watch)
Wed better get cracking if we
want to get there before dawn

Hendricksson and Dov stamp up the concrete steps leading to the
surface

T RNO

Hendricksson and Dov emerge and stand for a moment contemplating
the depressing vista The ground is bare and rubble-strewn with
the ruins of buildings standing out here and there like yellowing
skulls

HENDRICKSSON
Welcome to Fort Apache Have you
heard that one yet

DOV
Heard what one sir

HENDRICKSSON
Welcome to Fort Apache where
theres a woman behind every tree

There are no trees

Hendricksson lights a cigarette and offers one to Dov Dov
declines

They move away from the bunker At the top of the hill on which
the NEB messenger died Hendricksson pauses and raises his field
glasses

A dead landscape We can see for miles Endless ash and slag
ruins of buildings Nothing stirsHe lowers the binoculars and
gets out the transmitter

HENDRICKSSON
(into transmitter)
This is Bona Fide calling Simon Pure
Radio check Over

ELBARAKS VOICE
Reading you loud and clear Bona Fide
Over

HENDRICKSSON
My next transmission will be at
twenty-four hundred hours Over
and out

He puts away the transmitter and they push off Picking their way
down the opposite side of the slope The ridge now between then
and the bunker

CAMERA CRANES UP and lets them dwindle to dots

A gleaming SCREAMER hulks huge in the close FOREGROUND It seems
to be SPYING on them through the rubble It TURNS slowly

FORWARD coming up behind Hendricksson and Dov

CUT BACK to the two men who hear nothing until a
SUDDEN FLURRY behind them -- followed by a loud SQUEAL
They SPIN rifles searching The screamer takes off
lickety-split carrying something small and furry

a ae HENDRICKSSON

ra
(relaxing)
A rat
They watch it go
DOV
Rat sir
HENDRICKSSON

“They go after rats too

They resume walking

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
I never saw that type before

DOV
Are there so many different types sir
HENDRICKSSON
ba Oh hell yes They were built to learn

so they could keep’a step ahead of the
- enemy So right away we started seeing

new types appearing
Se
( DOV
Like what types sir
HENDRICKSSON

Oh -- your basic runner and then
they came out with a jumper and a
wall climber and one that burrowed
down into the dirt Then theres the
‘blade types Circular sav wire saw
snipper and daisy wheel And a new type
with chainsaws that flip out like frog’s
tongues That one is over designed in

wy opinion

Dov is disturbed This has been troubling him since his arrival

DOV
Sir they didnt tell us any of this
at Sanctuary They were only
supposed to be psychological weapons
To demoralize the eneny

HENDRICKSSON
(ruefully)
They sure are psychological
They dont just want to slaughter
NEBs they want the next batch
to say Please God dont let me die
that way” Its that poise they make

that and the way they kill Like a
hummingbird made out of razor blades
Let one of those things into a bunker
full of NEBs and sixty seconds later
its rubber bag time Out in the open
youve got a slight chance if you
hear them coming you can pick them
off -- 1f youre a dead shot But —
if they sneak up on you youre
hamburger before your cigarette hits
the floor

Dovs face is now the color of this sheet of paper He stares at
the jammer on his wrist

DOV
Sir how well do these things work

‘HENDRICKSSON
Perfectly They broadcast
a coded signal that tells the
screamers youre not alive The
screamers only attack living things
Its not us that has to worry
Mendelsohn
TS

Around them as they walk the world is a slag heap with dark
weeds growing from the ashes and bones

DOV
But they are winning the war for us
right sir

HENDRICKSSON
They may have already won it
Look hadnt you better smoke

DOV
What for sir

HENDRICKSSON
(such ignorance is unbelievable)
They dont tell you a fucking
thing up there do they For
the radiation Yoyo

DOV
Oh yes They said we wouldnt
have to worry about that sir
there was a drug you could take

HENDRICKSSON
(holds out cigarette)
Yes This

The light begins to dawn Dov takes the red cigarette and accepts
a light from Hendricksson Coughing he spews out a cloud of
snoke

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
(as they resume walking)
But you have to keep it in your
system at all times so puff up
and stay that way

He waves at some dense bushes that grow profusely by the side of
the road

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
The goddamn stuff grows wild
everywhere It seems to thrive
on the radiation

They walk along puffing eyes reddening
-

a

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Learn to like it on Sirius 6B
you smoke for your health

Bloody SUNSET smears itself across the shattered landscape

‘ Nearby the ruins of a town rise up a few walls and heaps of
debris

Hendricksson and Dov trudge on their strides eating up the
kilometers

Dovs anxious eyes watch scabrous grey possums with naked pink
tails chase iguana across the rocks

To him this world is a bizarre drean

DOV
(emboldened by the unreality
and the effect of the cigarette)
Sir May I ask you
a personal question sir Please
say no if Im out of line sir

HENDRICKSSON
Fire away

DOV
Well back at the bunker sir
when Captain Elbarak called you Nick

HENDRICKSSON
oh that

Dov
Nobody else calls you Nick sir

HENDRICKSSON
That goes way back Elbarak and me
have known each other since our acadeny
days back on Earth Elbarak hes well
I guess you could call him my best friend
(pulling himself back
to the present)
Elbarak thinks I have a distrustful
nature which I do So anyway there
used to be a unit of currency called
‘a nickel and once upon a time people
made counterfeit ones out of lead
-(

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
So if you were suspicious you
bit the nickel to see if your teeth
left marks So Elbarak took to
calling me Nickel-Biter and
‘then shortened it to Nick See
Nick for Nickel-Biter Cautious

Dov is amused

DOV
Did you bite nickels sir

HENDRICKSSON
“Naw I never saw a lead nickel
It was just an expression

It is magic hour and the sun is in their eyes Se when SOMEONE
abruptly STANDS UP in the ruins’ Hendricksson and Dov FAIL TO SEE
THE FIGURE

Then Dov SEES IT

A SILHOUETTE against the sun

He FREEZES Rifle in his hands Jaw open a mile Finger frozen
on the trigger

Hendricksson TURNS

-- SEES Dov frozen with his rifle pointed at the FIGURE --
-- DROPS like a stone behind cover (weeds) at the same tine
yanking Dov down by his coattail

HENDRICKSSON
Down you fool
(to FIGURE )
You Come out

From the shell of the ruined building the FIGURE advances
Walking hesitantly toward then

HENDRICKSSON
(blinded by the setting sun)
Stop

The figure stops
Hendricksson shades his eyes
It is a BOY

They lower their guns and rise The BOY stands silently Looking
at them He is small skeletal Not very old -- possibly eight

But it is hard to tell under all the rags and filth His hair is
long and matted His eyes are large but without
expressionwhat we can see of them in the gloom of the dying
sun He seems an indistinct shadow
He holds SOMETHING in his arms
HENDRICKSSON
(sharply)
Whats that youve got there

The boy holds out the object
It isa tey bear A ravaged teddy bear

HENDRICKSSON
I dont want it Keep it

The boy hugs the bear again

HENDRICKSSON
Where do you live —

BOY
In there

HENDRICKSSON

The settlement

Settlement A few walls and heaps of debris

BOY
Yes
HENDRICKSSON
How many of you are there
BOY
How many
HENDRICKSSON
How many people How bigs your
settlement
The boy does not answer
DOV

Youre not all by yourself are you

BOY
Yes

DOV
(moved)
How do you stay alive
BOY
I eat food
DOV
What kind of food
BOY
Different
DOV

How old are you

BOY
Fourteen

It seems impossible The wretch is tiny emaciated His arms and
legs are like pipe cleaners with big knobby joints

Hendricksson peers into the boys Eace Big eyes in the densening
twilight Big and dark Hendricksson strikes his cigarette
lighter and waves it in front of the boys face No expression in
the flickering flame

HENDRICKSSON

Are you blind
BOY
No I can see some
HENDRICKSSON
How do you get away from the screamers
BOY
Screamers
HENDRICKSSON

The machines that kill

BOY
I hide Can I come with you

Hendricksson snaps off the lighter rises and turns away Looks
down the road to memorize the terrain before total darkness hits

DOV
How about it sir Can we take him
along

a

HENDRICKSSON
Are you kidding

Dovs shocked stare annoys Hendricksson He doesnt appreciate
the youth presuming to act as his conscience

He pulls out his food rations

HENDRICKSSON
Here This is food Take it and go
Okay

He tosses them down in front of the boy The boy does nothing

HENDRICKSSON
Well be coming back this way in
a couple of days If youre stiil
here when we get back you can come
with us then All right

BOY
I want to come with you now
HENDRICKSSON
Its too hard a walk
BOY
I can walk
DOV

Sir why cant we take him along

HENDRICKSSON
To the conference with the NEBs

DOV
Why not sir

“‘HENDRICKSSON
Why not Because hed slow us down
And then what would we do with him
Raise him Think Yo-yo

DOV
Sir we cant leave him here

HENDRICKSSON
Mendelsohn -- you cant save them all

DOV
We can save one Sir
a

Hendricksson shrugs wearily Gestures to the boy

HENDRICKSSON
Lets get going

EXTERIOR - VALLEY NIGHT

Walking Hendricksson Dov the Boy Following the remains of a
road

Around them is what once were orchards acres of fruit trees and
grapes Nothing remains now but a nightmare of broken stumps

DOV
Whats your name
David Simmons

DOV

David What happened to your
mother and father

DAVID
They died

DOV
How

DAVID
In the blasts

DOV
How long ago

DAVID
Six years

HENDRICKSSON

- Youve been alone for six years

DAVID
There were other people for a while

HENDRICKSSON
Where are they

DAVID
They died

HENDRICKSSON

And youve been alone ever since
DAVID

Yes
DOV

Are we walking too fast

DAVID
No Where are we going

DOV
To the NEB lines

DAVID
NEB

HENDRICKSSON
The enemy The people who started
the war They began all this
Davids face shows no expression ° “He continues to trail a little
off to the rear hugging his dirty teddy bear against his chest

Hendricksson checks his watch

HENDRICKSSON
Well make camp up ahead

EXTERIOR - CAMPSITE - NIGHT

They have built a fire in a hollow between some slabs of
concrete using weeds for fuel The three of them are sitting
around the fire the orange light guttering on their faces like a
dream turning them into flame ghosts

DOV
Sir who invented the screamers

HENDRICKSSON
A lady named Necessity We were
losing the war Hell we tried
all kinds of stuff We even
tried mutating animals into weapons
The screamers were just another one
of those screwball ideas Nobody had
any idea they were going to turn out
to be such a whopping success

DOV
Why are they so successful sir

HENDRICKSSON
Their capacity to learn And they
require no human supervision
Theyre turned out automatically in the
underground factories a long way down
Some of those factories are behind NEB
lines now

DOV
Who runs the factories

HENDRICKSSON
Nobody runs them They build themselves
They scavenge their own raw materials
(reflective)
Nobody would dare go down there

Hendricksson fishes the ration packets out of the fire Passes

one to Dov and one to David David examines the food and passes
e it back 5

ir DOV

f Dont you want any
t David shakes his head no
DOV
Why not

David says nothing

DOV
You have to eat

No response

DOV
Whats wrong David

The boy squats motionless in the shadows his knees knobby and
pale Dov looks to Hendricksson for help
DOV 7
Sir whats wrong with him

ee

ti
yo

HENDRICKSSON
Maybe hes a mutant and hes
used to special food

DOV
David Do you need special food

HENDRICKSSON
Let him alone When he’s hungry
hell find something to eat

Dov stares at Hendricksson then he leans over and takes David by
the arn
DOV
David David

Hendricksson grabs Dov and spins him around

HENDRICKSSON

(angry)
Life is not the same any more
It will never be the same again
Youre going to have to realize that

They settle into silence each with his own thoughts
Hendricksson picks up something from the ground and sits toying
with it

Suddenly Hendricksson lets out a tremendous YELL and jumps to his
feet

Dov and David are on their feet too David grabs for his teddy
bear

DOV
What is it

i HENDRICKSSON
An insect I thought it was
a fucking throw-away cigarette lighter

Hendricksson gets control of himself and sits back down

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
It was an insect

DOV
Jesus sir you really had me going
there
nr

HENDRICKSSON

(a fine frost of
sweat on his brow)

I cant stand things that aren’t
what theyre supposed to be

Hendricksson shrugs off the fit of nerves calms himself down

He checks his watch

Midnight

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)

He gets out the transmitter Unfolds it
Flips out the multiplex antenna

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)

This is Bona Fide calling Simon Pure
Do you read me Simon Come in Over

ELBARAKS VOICE

I hate those silly names Over

HENDRICKSSON

Too bad Theyre the only ones I can
remember I gather you can read me Over

ELBARAKS VOICE

Loud and clear Fido How are you
Over

HENDRICKSSON

Just fine Were camped out in zone
B-Baker Blue about an hours walk from

the NEB bunker Well wait here until

oh three hundred and then move out
Anything worth reporting on your end Over

ELBARAKS VOICE

Leone got drunk and broke his collar
“bone Over

HENDRICKSSON

Give him a purple heart My next
transmission will be at oh six hundred
Over and out

The stars are bright in the black sky Dov is lounging back with
a cigarette in his mouth and his hands clasped behind his head

looking up at then

Overhead is a gleaming band something weve

never seen before a thin silvery strip spanning the dome of the
heavens from horizon to horizon

“DOV
Do you remember the Moon

Hendricksson says nothing Hes still in a bad mood about the
insect that deceived him

‘ “ DOV (CONTD)
Do you remember how it had a face
and when it was full you could see
it looking off over the top of the
Planet It had an expression
kind of thoughtful and a
little bit sad I wonder what it
was looking at

DAVID
Whats the mune

DOV
The Moon was a big light in
the sky It only came out at
night That little strip of
iight up there is ali thats left

of it

RENDRICKSSON
It made all the fruitcakes and psychos
act up

DOV

It was pretty

HENDRICKSSON
Weve got three hours Get some sleep

They stretch out on the rocky ground tossing and turning
“DISSOLVE TO

THE DARENESS BEFORE DAWN
A hand is shaking Dov awake

DOV
(sits up abruptly)
Huh What

Hendricksson is standing in front of him in the gloom He taps
his watch
KR

Dov rubs his grainy eyes and comes to his feet ‘The fire is
dead David stands silently in the still darkness holding his
teddy bear

HENDRICKSSON
Time to move out

It is that amount of brightening sky just before the sun ‘peeks up
over the horizon

They walk down a pot-holed gully that was once a street between
skeletons of buildings covered with the eternal dark weeds
Water splashes in puddles in the middle of the street Rats and
iguana scamper The sky is just turning grey and the whole scene
looks like Berlin after the second war back on Earth

DAVID
will we be there soon

HENDRICKSSON’
Yes Why

At the end of the street stand a couple of gutted military
vehicles Beyond them the street has been blockaded by a
barricade of dirt and barbed wire about ten feet high

Hendricksson drops to his belly and squirms up to the crest of
the low ridge where he peers through the barbed wire

TO -

On the other side is a wasteland of chewed-up hills and ridges
Hendricksson lifts his field glasses

Silent and tense Dov and David wait below Hendricksson
HENDRICKSSON ©
(sweating)
Damn
He pulls out the NEB map and studies it
He takes out a telescoping rod like a car antenna which he opens

out to a length of three feet He ties a white flag to it Then
he climbs to his feet feeling like a target
a

KENDRICKSSON
Lets go

Dov and David come up behind him together they pick their way
through the loops of barbed wire -- Dov helping the ill-clad waif
-- and walk down the far side of the dirt barricade

- Up ahead a TALL FIGURE appears on a ridge cloak flapping

Greygreen
NEB
Hendrickssons head snaps toward hin

HENDRICKSSON
There

He holds the white flag toward the NEB -- behind whom a SECOND
NEB appears Hendricksson waves the white flag over his head
like a signalman

A third figure joins them A WOMAN Words are exchanged and they
RAISE THEIR RIFLES AIMING

Hendricksson freezes

HENDRICKSSON
Stop Were --

The two NEBs FIRE

The high-impact bullets SLAM INTO DAVID KNOCK HIM BACK LIKE A
WET DISHRAG

DOV
Oh my God

Hendricksson turns in time to see David hit the ground Teddy
bear flying He whirls back and raises his own rifle but in the ©
time it takes him to turn away and back again the NEBs have
started to dive for cover

His rifle-launched antipersonnel rockets slam into the ridge
throwing up huge fireballs and hurling gravel in all directions
but hitting no one

EENDRICKSSON
(screams)
You filth You murdering scum

There is no reply from the ridge where the drifting smoke
obscures any possible target

DOV
Colonel sir Colonel Hendricksson

- The urgency and horror in Dovs voice make him turn instantly -—

to see the Dov hovering over the body of DAVID
Hendricksson scrambles over to the pathetic little corpse

What he sees is freaky even for a combat veteran and devastating
to Hendricksson

What he SEES is an IMMENSE ENTRY WOUND in Davids chest big

enough to throw a cat in and from this cavity SPRAYS a fountain

of blood But this blood comes in COLORS aquamarine BLUE
and canary YELLOW in two big jets and it smells like
burning automobile tires

From the remains of David rolls a little candystriped WHEEL
Inside we SEE fluidic relays servo motors bundles of
multicolored wires like twisty licorice A section of charred
plastic falls in

DAVID IS A MACHINE

For Hendricksson this is a thunderclap His mind whirls and his
heart hammers This is ten thousand times worse than an insect
mimicking a cigarette lighter Hendricksson cannot tolerate
falseness in any guise and now he is confronted with the
ultimate impostor He slams into shock and stands paralyzed
gaping down stupidly at the abominable thing at his feet

‘Dov whose dismay is in the normal range reaches out with the

barrel of his rifle and tentatively stirs the intricate pieces of
broken machinery With the muzzle he lifts Davids hand When he
does so 4 GLEAMING BLADES FLIP out of the fingers like -
switchblade knives SNAP

A death spasn

Both men leap back but Hendricksson SCREAMS
whips up his rifle --
and SQUEEZES the trigger

Anticlimax Nothing happens Instead of firing the gun BEEPS
insuitingly Wild-eyed he glares down at it A little redline
display scolds him

RELOAD ROCKETS

There he stands Dazed and panting The variable-amno rifle
quivering in his clawed hands Sweat pouring from his face

Dov stares at him in astonishment Genuinely surprised to see his
tough-as-nails commander snap like a bent pencil

Meanwhile the TWO NEB SOLDIERS and the WOMAN have approached
Dov and Hendricksson turn and stare at then

NEB 1 points to the body of David

NEB 2
Look Hurry up Theres no
time to waste “ao

They look

This is the first time we have actually seen David under direct
lighting conditions The sun is rising and in the cold light of
dawn David is not such a good imitation You can see the seams
running down the arms and legs The skin color is off The eyes
are not very lifelike He needed the darkness of night and shadow
to conceal his imperfections A creature of the night

NEB 1
Yes Its a fucking machine
Now come on

He raises a small camera and starts snapping pictures of the
rubber-skinned robot

NEB 2

(who is younger

ana less harsh)
We watched it tagging you
(—

DOV
Tagging us

NEB 2
Thats what they do They tag
along with you Into the bunker
Thats how they get in

HENDRICKSSON
The Forward Command I came to
negotiate with the NEB Forward Command

NEB 1
There is no more Forward Command The
three of us are all thats left
The rest were all down in the bunker

A silence like granite No birds nothing

NEB 1
Seen ‘enough Remember it Now come on

He turns on his heel and strides away y through the crunching
debris

The other NEB and the woman start after him
WOMAN
(beckons)
Well come on
Dazed Hendricksson and Dov scramble after them

NEB 1 leads them to a round rusted plate in the ground A

manhole cover He hauls it open -- an immense strain its heavy

and -thick

Immediately the WOMAN climbs down into the dark hole followed by

NEB 2 They vanish from sight

NEB 1
Get int 7

Hendricksson and Dov hang back

NEB 1 (CONTD)
Quickly or not at all
an

46

Hendricksson acutely jumpy and suspicious vacillates like a
tuning fork then makes his decision and lurches down into the
hole eyes snapping with distrust He is followed by an unhappy
Dov

Last one in is NEB 1 lowering the massive steel lid down after
himself “

It slams shut with a solid clank

Darkness and dripping water and a rusted steel ladder and five
ill-assorted people climbing down into a cavity beneath the
earth

This was once the end of a sewer tunnel

until a cave-in sealed it off

Now a choked mass of broken concrete and twisted rubble fills the
passage from ceiling to floor

The tunnel is completely obstructed and impassable

The result a little concrete chamber totally enclosed and
secure -- more or less
The only way in or out up the ladder and through the manhole
cover

This dank cell may not appear too habitable but it is clearly
the abode of someone It has been fixed up into a depressing
sort of living quarters a subterranean apartment with
furnishings

A kerosene lantern guttering on a table —- no electricity

A pile of dirty dishes

A ten-gallon drum collecting dripping water and an assortment of
tin cans and bottles

A ragged curtain and peeking out from behind it a grey cot and
some shapeless clothes hanging on a hook

Singularly dismal

The woman the two NEB soldiers and the two Alliance
representatives distribute themselves around the room in an
uneasy circle eyeing each other They cling to their rifles

Hendricksson stands very still Only his eyes move flickering
around the room firing glances into shadows like darts from a

blowgun

HENDRICKSSON
What do you mean no Forward Command

NEB 1
(angrily)

You aont know

Hendricksson knows

HENDRICKSSON

HENDRICKSSON
What does that mean

NEB 2
vivisectionit means the sutting up
of live things

NEB 2
(the tough one older)
They started out small like little

-mice Then they got bigger and faster

and they started hiding Bad yes

’ But everything is bad and were still

winning the war and the Alliance is
finished they got nothing left but
eyes to cry with Then yesterday --

up toward the ceiling)

NEB 42
The first one followed a patrol
back to the bunker They felt
sorry for him and brought it in with
them It let the rest of them in

HENDRICKSSON
(sinking feeling in the
pit of his stomach)
Are you sure theyre screamers

NEB 1 tosses something to Hendricksson
Hendricksson snatches it out of the air
A small metal PLATE with screwholes in it it was originally

affixed to something The corners have been bent back to pry it
off “

Printed on the plate is

ALLIANCE DEPT OF DEFENSE
AUTONOMOUS MOBILE SWORD
REVISED

Printed directly beneath that is that little emblem weve come to
recognize in the supermarket that unintelligible cluster of
black stripes the computer reads the Universal Computer
Code -

Hendricksson stares and stares and stares

HENDRICKSSON

NEB 1
Our soldiers got one of then
Before they were killed
That was on it Under the

Hendricksson puts his finger on the identity plate On the
— toothcomb pattern we

HENDRICKSSON

Say Its a symbol

RENDRICKSSOW

It means something A computer could
read that

We didnt wait around and discuss it

How many survived

NEB 1
No one survived

on

Fm Hendricksson looks at hin
wo

HENDRICKSSON
You survived

NEB 1
We werent there

NEB 2
We didnt know until we returned
Those terrible children

NEB 1
Children Built by Alliance material
beneath NEB feet and behind NEB lines

HENDRICKSSON
They werent behind your lines until
they became your lines

NEB 1
Its an atrocity a war crime The
Alliance will be held responsible
when the war trials are held
am

HENDRICKSSON

Coming from you thats rich The
people who airdropped a million rabid
bata in our kindergarten sectors

War trials Better wait and see
whos holding them first Pinhead
And while youre waiting go take

a flying leap up your own asshole

The eyes of NEB 1 glitter out from beneath his bucket helmet
like two tiny thumbtacks

His mouth has clamped into such a thin line its practically
vanished He is no one to tamper with He takes insults badly

But Hendricksson is a nuclear pile He practices stare-down

matches with cats and so far this has not been a good morning

Hes over-reflexed wired and ready to go

With guns in your hands this is taut stuff

Both Dov andthe junior NEB are freaking out - almost ready to
jump their own senior officers before the rocn explodes into a
furnace of state-of-theart gunfire

Only the woman -- lounging back on aheap of rags seens
unbothered by all this She watches it all with sardonic
amusement like it doesnt affect her Like shes seen it all
before A cool cookie

WOMAN
Hey

HENDRICKSSON
(eyes on NEB 1)
Are you talking to me lady

WOMAN
Yes to you Does the Alliance
really have tobacco

The irrelevancy of this almost distracts him from the NEB

HENDRICKSSON
What

WOMAN
I heard you still have tobacco
Is that true

HENDRICKSSON
Yes We have tobacco

WOMAN
Give me a tobacco cigarette

Blankly he takes his finger off-the trigger to fish in his

pocket for a cigarette

He gives her a white machine-rolled cigarette and lights it for
er oo

She relishes it blowing a big cloud of smoke up at the ceiling

The crisis has broken and though there is still considerable
irritability everyone starts breathing again

qhey scuff around clearing their throats and shaking out the
kinks

Dov is doing a little dance

DOV
Sir Sir
(hopping up and down and
pointing at his watch)
The time The time

The time
Ohmygod
Up snaps Hendrickssons wrist

HENDRICKSSON
Its eleven hundred hours Im late

Hendricksson dumps his pack and starts tearing through it Hes
certainly got everyones attention NEB 1 has tightened his

grip on his rifle again and is crackling with suspicion

HENDRICKSSON
(explaining)
I have to radio my bunker Its
a radio check to let them know
were all right and Im late

He sets up the transmitter at the speed of light

NEB 71
What will they do

HENDRICKSSON
Maybe assume were dead and reject
our transmissions as NEB impostors
This is Bona Fide calling Simon Pure
Come in Simon Over

Crackle and rush of HARD STATIC

NEB 2
You wont get anything down here

Hendricksson stares around the stony tomb Maybe a better spot

NEB 1
Nothing can penetrate this
You gotta go outside

No time to test their honesty He peers up at the ceiling

HENDRICKSSON
(trying to look through
30 feet of stone)
How safe is it up there

Their faces tell the story

HENDRICKSSON
(folding the transmitter) -
Mendelsohn come pull me down
if something horrible happens

Hendricxsson stuffs the transmitter under his arm picks up his
rifle and heads for the ladder well

At the foot of the ladder he takes a vital second to look down at
his gun -- set for RELOAD ROCKETS in glaring red -- and twists
the selector switch to something with a full clip -- an
apple-green FLECHETTE SPRAY Then he hauls ass up the ladder
with Dov at his heels taking flakes of rust in the face

The lid scrapes aside and a tense Hendricksson sticks his head

and gun up into the dull midday light

Nothing threatening Nothing at all Just gray ash and mountains
of weed-choked bricks

Bom
et
7 He shoves out the transmitter flips it open and turns it on
‘ HENDRICKSSON
This is Bona Fide calling Simon Pure
Do you read me Simon Come in Over
The static is still awful But ELBARAKS VOICE comes through
distant and interrupted floating in and out like a cork on the
tide
ELBARAKS VOICE

on the ground)
God Damn

Thats it He folds the transmitter and backs down into the
steamy manhole dragging the plate shut behind hin

INTERIOR BURROW - DAY (NO SUNLIGHT)

Dov retreats down out of Hendrickssons way The two NEBs and
the woman wait for his report

NEB 1
Well

HENDRICKSSON
Idont even know if they heard me
The static blew them away before
they could confirn

NEB 2
The radiation is pretty’bad here

Hendricksson consults the cluster of instrumentation on his
wrist like a big panel of digital watches

HENDRICKSSON
No shit Mendelsohn light up

Both of them fire up the red-paper cigarettes This starts off a

‘round of cigarette-lighting until everyone is fuming away The

NEBs have their own anti-radiation cigarettes which they share
with the woman
HENDRICKSSON
(looking at his
radiation meter)
Jesus G-for-Gregory This place is
a fucking furnace

‘They puff away like crazy Soon the room is so hazy you could cut

it with a knife and they all seem considerably more relaxed
except for the woman who couldnt have been much more relaxed in
the first place The tension falls away from their bodies and
they shuffle around blinking at each other with red streaming
eyes Hendricksson looks around
HENDRICKSSON
What is this place
WOMAN
This is ny hone
HENDRICKSSON
You live here
WOMAN
Yes
HENDRICKSSON
Like a mouse in a hole Are you
and mouse
WOMAN

I am Jessica

HENDRICKSSON
Jessica Just Jessica

JESSICA
Jessica Delacluse You want coffee
(slight French accent)
Who are you

NEB 1
I think we all better identify
ourselves nov

HENDRICKSSON
Im Colonel Joseph T Hendricksson
Commanding Officer Alliance Forward
Command West And this -- is my aide
Lieutenant Mendelsohn

Dov locks at him in considerable startlement A moment ago he
was a PFC
HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
a man in my position needs a man

in your position Lieutenant
Hang in there

Dov stands straighter and looks sternly at the NEBs

Hendricksson nods to NEB 1

HENDRICKSSON
Your turn

1 snaps to attention and thuds together the heels of his
Ke encrusted boots

NEB 1
Sergeant Robert Becker attached to
the 5th BEB Army Forward Command
I am an NEB
(and proud of it)

HENDRICKSSON
(dryly)
At ease Sergeant

NEB 2 lets go of his rifle to wipe off his hand on his pants

NEB 2
Alex Ross Impressed ‘Into the
NEB Army six months ago
(extends his hand)

BECKER (reminds him)
Ross
a Ross
Yes Im a mere corporal
(shakes hands with

the two)
Youre all my superiors

DOV
This gear is awfully heavy

As if by agreement they all let their heavy packs slide to the
floor then take off their helmets and run their hands through
their sweaty hair Quite a relief Rifles finally leave hands for
positions leaning against things within reach Hendricksson and
Becker eye each other suspiciously during this stripping of
excess gear

There is now a general scratching of itchy sweaty body parts

with the armor off we can better see the two individual
“enenies beneath

1 -- BECKER -- is older with dark thinning hair and B-Bs for
eyes A tough cookie The woman is a cool cookie and hes a
tough cookie

2 -- ROSS -- is young with long blonde hair A smooth round
face and a cornsilk beard Hes an apple strudel and Dov is an
animal cracker and Hendricksson a piece of hardtackj

DOV
Im hungry
JESSICA who all this time has not stirred from her laidback
position on the rags rises catlike and swaggers over to a
makeshift stove She starts a fire (dry weeds) under a can of
yater igniting it with one of the ubiquitous disposable
ghters

HENDRICKSSON
(hopefully)
Real coffee

JESSICA
No

Hes not interested He and Dov start rooting in their packs for
rations Lunch The NEBs eye them with suspicion which
changes to covert envy when they see the Alliance-issue ration
packages emerge They have no rations of their own

HENDRICKSSON
(eating)
How did you people survive anyway
Screamers dont normally leave witnesses

The two NEB men exchange a look

ROSS
We were here

HENDRICKSSON
Here What the hell were you doing
in here

Ross and Becker look blase

JESSICA
(boiling the coffee)
It was their turn

Hendricksson and Dov crank their heads around and gape at her

JESSICA —
If not them it would have been
somebody else
(shrugs)
It was their turn

Its true then NEBs have women The Alliance has tobacco

(apologeticelly)
It was only for a couple of hours
When we returned to the bunker we
found
(words fail him)

HENDRICKSSON
No more NEBs and no more Davids

BECKER
Except for the single one The one
with the Alliance badge

HENDRICKSSON
Yeah I already got that part
about the Alliance So
you swallowed your gum tore the ©
-- plate off the robot then high-tailed
it back here and havent been out since

Becker feels his courage is being challenged He spits on the
floor angrily and stands up

BECKER
Commander unload your handgun please
and put it on the table well leave now

HENDRICKSSON
Where are you going

BECKER
To our rear command To bring them
the evidence of this Alliance atrocity

HENDRICKSSON
‘How On foot Without these
(taps his jammer)
Say thats a bright idea Do you
guys have transport

noo BECKER
Ne Ne All our vehicles were sabotaged
by the vivs
(a disgusted gesture)

Ross takes a deep breath and takes the plunge

ROSS
Theres only one place left for
us to go anymore If we want to
live weve got to go with you
To the Alliance Forward Command

HENDRICKSSON

(to Ross)
Thats easier said than done son
These jammers can be stretched
to include a hitch-hiker if you know
the trick But its tough with the ©
woman too

(thinks)
Lets see

BECKER
on As your prisoners

« HENDRICKSSON
— Were here to negotiate You guys
arent prisoners of war youre
ambassadors-atlarge You get the Class
A treatment You get to eat what I eat
(shoves a ration
package at him)

Startled Becker says no more but resumes his seat and digs in
to chow down Ross is touched when Dov follows his bosss example
and shares his yummy algae cakes

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
I dont want to move out before dark
the screamers are blind as a bat in
certain frequencies of light You
know about that

The NEBs nod wisely and pat their helmets sitting beside them on
the slimy stone floor like inverted coal scuttles crusted over
with various doohickeys They understand very well

HENDRICKSSON
(slaps his knee)
I Knew you guys would know that
one because its a survival trick

Dev doesnt understand at all

DOV
What sir

HENDRICKSSON
They have terrible night vision
They cant see pure yellow light at
all Its their Achilles heel
So when the sun goes
down I want to go poke around in the
bunker a little while

The tension in the room immediately increases by several pounds
per square inch

ROSS
(horrified)
Go back down into our bunker again
HRENDRICKSSON
Thats right I havent been yet
remember
Ross
(pleads)

Doesnt Earths law say a man cant
be hung twice if he survives the
first hanging

HENDRICKSSON
Afraid the hangman wont be out tonight
huh
(smiles)
Let me show you boys something

Hendricksson holds out his WRIST

“

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Youve picked these up off bodies
but youve never been able to use one

He holds his arm up over his head like hes trying to catch a
fly ball

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
The field goes out from ny wrist
four meters in all directions
So if some smart NEB sticks real
close to my left arm hes covered
too right So stop
sweating ‘Tonight youll be safe
for once

The most impressed of all is Dov

DOV
Where did you learn that trick sir

Hendricksson shoots him an irritable leok Doesnt the punk
think seven continuous years of combat teach you something

HENDRICKSSON
Now get this straight Numero Uno
it is critical that I talk to my people
and the radio in your bunker has got
to be a lot more powerful than
this dinky little Motorola Numero Two
at the risk of spoiling everybodys
good time allow me to remind you
that the NEBs have been known to pull
some pretty damn mean-minded tricks
so before I go telling my Commander-
in-chief that the NEB Forward Commands
been liquidated Im going to see if
its true Right Number Three and
most important of all Im in command
now and what I say goes Got it

No-one argues Hes the one with the jamners and the food and the
loudest mouth Hes in charge

KENDRICKSSON
(consults his watch)
So when the sun goes down we go in

Hendrickssons watch BLIPS at hin

HENDRICKSSON
Mendelsohn light up

Mendelsohn obeys So does everyone ele This rouses the woman
from her languid indifference
JESSICA
Give me another tobacco cigarette
I forgot how good tobacco is

Hendricksson reaches into his pocket for the pack We leave them
there smoking in moody silence as we

DISSOLVE TO

EXTERIOR HORIZON - SUNDOWN

The sky is furnace red The horizon bites into the sun like
black snaggle teeth into a melon

- Wo WN

Once again full combat gear Four soldiers -- two Alliance two
NEB Sitting huddled like a football team with rifles Taking a
final briefing from Hendricksson

HENDRICKSSON
(studying his wrist
instrumentation)
And the sun is down now
Okay people turn on your buglights

They all get up and switch on VIVID YELLOW HELMET LIGHTS The
NEB ones look like yellow miners lanterns The Alliance version
is more like a penlight situated over the right ear and pointed
forward so its shooting a beam of light wherever Hendricksson
looks He reaches up and adjusts it - irises it out to a wide
spotlight then down to a pinpoint Settles on a ‘cone of medium
angle ‘The burrow lights up with the INTENSE YELLOW GLARE

HENDRICKSSON
Mendelsohn youve got one too

Dov finally finds the switch Adds his own headlamp to the
yellow blaze—

HENDRICKSSON
Thats your invisibility suit
You see them and they dont see you
All right everybody listen up
Were going to do this by the
“buddy systen

Hendricksson pulls thin twisty metal rope out of his kit

HENDRICKSSON
The center of the field is the
jammer on my left wrist If youve
got ahold of ny left hand youre
as deep into the field as I an
Take a couple of steps
away from me and youre in deep
shit So tonight were going
to chain you guys to our left elbows
Thatll keep us from thinking
with our legs Okay

There are no questions

HENDRICKSSON
Then lets go

They all rise massively Their sweaty gear rustles and clanks as
they head for the ladder Headlamps bobbing like jackolanterns

Hendricksson pauses in front of Jessica who is curled up on her
rag chair sullenly picking lint off the front of her NEB arny
shirt

HENDRICKSSON
See you in a couple of hours
JESSICA
(sulks)
Give me another cigarette
HENDRICKSSON
Sorry All gone
JESSICA
Too bad
HENDRICKSSON

Better start packing Mouse

They leave her there pouting and make their exit in a blaze of
golden glory

EXTERIOR - ABOVE THE MOUSEHOLE - NIGHT

Darkness The manhole cover scrapes open like a stove lid and
bright YELLOW LIGHT bursts out

Hendricksson comes up first
Waits while the others cravl out

Scans the darkness with his rifle and his buglight
Like a little locomotive headlight on his forehead
Like a third eye

He sticks up his hand for their attention

He points to his LEFT ELBOW

Time to tie up

He gestures for Becker to bring his own elbow over

Each Alliance soldier ties hizself to a NEB Between then about
a meter of slinky dangling chain Dov ties himself to Ross
Hendricksson to Becker

An awkward way to work

Hendricksson points at Becker (youy then eut into the night
(LEAD THE WAY)

with a silent snarl Becker launches them off

cuT TO
EXTERIOR NEB BUNKER NIGHT

The NEB bunker looks like a modern high-security prison It-is
surrounded by a tall chain-link fence Carbon are lights hang
from metal poles They illuminate a bare section of gravelly
ground one hundred meters across

No guards

Silence

Hendricksson gestures for the others to do nothing He kneels and
aims at the

CLOSEST LIGHT

Hendricksson fires

The light vanishes with an eerie pop He shoots out all the
lights one by one The landscape falls totally dark except for
the yellow bug lamps

Hendricksson leads the others around the chain-link fence until
they find a recently-torn gap Hendricksson points at Becker
waving him ahead

The two NEBs form human shields for the Alliance troops as they
climb through the hole in the fence They cross thirty yards of
crunching gravel Their bug lights reveal

A YAWNING CHASM -- the ENTRANCE INTO THE NEB BUNKER Its doors
gape open revealing only BLACKNESS INSIDE

Hendricksson points toward this hole in the ground

Becker clenches his jaw straightens his shoulders and with a
glare at Hendricksson walks down the concrete steps

INTERIOR - NEB BUNKER NIGHT

The four soldiers move through a series of underground rooms
connected by concrete tunnels EMPHASIZE the precision required
to negotiate this labyrinth while chained together

The bunker is empty of life ANGLES ON various walls and
ceilings splashed with dried blood In the intense yellow
Glare it looks like someone has thrown black paint over the
walls and ceilings

Becker begins taking photographs of the blood splashes DOVS
REACTION to this painting of mayhem ROSS as he looks around in
ave

In one room Hendricksson sees

HALF-EATEN PLATES OF FOOD indicating the great speed with which
disaster struck

ANOTHER ANGLE shows smashed furniture amidst gleaming untouched
machinery Clearly the destruction was extremely selective

ANGLE ON bare patches showing where machinery stood
until recently

ZNTERIOR - RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT
On the far side of the room is a vast COMMUNICATIONS CONSOLE
Hendricksson and Becker cross quickly to it

The console is dead
Its insides dismantled and carried away
So much for the radio

Hendricksson softly pounds the console with his fist

HENDRICKSSON
shit

He moves on to the next item of importance
HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
(to Becker)
The plate

Becker reaches into his pocket pulls out the little metal plate
he took off the screamer and hands it to Hendricksson

Suddenly Beckers eyes widen and he FREEZES

The others TURN to see what he is looking at

A SCREAMER has entered through the far door

Fortunately it is a conventional type unrevised

One of the scavenger models

But it is BIG

They ALL FREEZE

Blind as a bat in the yellow helmet light the screamer gropes
around the room feeling the faces of various instrument panels
It finds a piece of machinery it likes

CLOSE on tiny screwdrivers as they extend from the screamer and
carefully remove an entire bank of equipment

The machinery disappears into the screamers bin

The scavenger continues its circuit of the room

Ross is sweating

The humans stand frozen not making a sound

They watch in horror as the steel spider groups its way slowly
‘TOWARD then

Ross is the closest

Slowly becoming aware of Rosss presence the screamer begins
groping its way toward him with its ARM-LIKE APPENDAGE

It REACHES for Ross

At that instant Dov STRETCHES HIS ARM ACROSS ROSSS BODY
ebringing the FIELD from his JAMMER over the screamer The
screamer is instantly deactivated With a loud CLANG it
collapses to the floor

Hendricksson steps overto the screamer and smashes it with his
rifle butt -

A moment to recover Several soft sighs
Hendricksson looks at Becker and taps the PLATE Becker nods

toward another room
Cautiously they move toward it

INTERIOR COMPUTER ROOM NIGHT

They enter rifles high and immediately see that half the
equipment in the room has been ripped out

Hendricksson moves swiftly to the COMPUTER and starts expertly
punching keys

The computer comes to life Sigh ofrelief
ANGLE THE PLATE and its incomprehensible row of black stripes

Hendricksson pushes the plate into

A SLOT IN THE COMPUTER

There is a “tiny CLICK as the computer scans the small cluster of
black stripes reading them like words

The computer screen lights up with two NEB words

HENDRICKSSON
What

DOV
Type Two
HENDRICKSSON
Say again

DOV
“Pype Two As in second variety

Hendricksson frowns in puzzlement He gestures sharply to the
exit

He waves the others in front of him watching the two NEBs very
Closely as they cautiously move out of the room rifles raised

cuT TO
EXTERIOR DEVASTATED LANDSCAPE NIGHT -

They are walking swiftly They look mpooked

ROSS
(hushed)
Why did they take the machinery

HENDRICKSSON
For parts

BECKER
What did they do with the bodies
of our troops ‘

HENDRICKSSON
They were built to learn And one
of the things theylearned was-that
rotting meat gives off methane gas
which is fuel Anotherthing they
learned was that fat can substitute
for petroleum And eyeball jelly
makes a dandy blade wax

Everyone is disgusted

ROSS
(appalled but fascinated)
They really do that Make appliances
from human bodies

HENDRICKSSON
Buster they refine the body
right down to the trace metals

A moody silence each man with his own thoughts

They arrive at the mousehole and untie themselves

INTERIOR MOUSEHOLE NIGHT

They come down the ladder showering grit and dust below then
Jessica is waiting dressed for travel She looks at then
registering their dour faces

HENDRICKSSON
All packed
(looks at his
radiation meter)
Everybody smoke
He tosses a cigarette to Dov and the NEBs share theirs with
Jessica They smoke in silence absorbed in their thoughts

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Were going to have to walk in single
file Its the only way to cover
everybody

ANGLE ON ROSS as he catches Becker STARING AT HIM Ross scowls
and looks away

JESSICA
What aid you find in the bunker

Hendricksson pulis on his cigarette He takes the little plate
from his pocket

HENDRICKSSON

This says Revised- Meaning the
David-type camouflaged screamer as
opposed to the old-type undisguised
machine Right But we didn’t know
what this meant

(points to the

computer code)
It means Type Two

JESSICA
So

HENDICKSSON
If David is Type Two there is another
type “Revised” type

There is another cold tense moment

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
I thought the screamers were bad but
at least they looked like what they
were But oh no we had to build them
to learn To improve themselves

Hendricksson is trembling His face gleams with sweat
i
Fe

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Now we wont know what anything is
any more We wont know if up is
down or black is white Weve turned
reality inside out

ANGLE ON Becker He is still STARING at Ross

Without warning Becker GRABS Ross AND THROWS HIM AGAINST THE
WALL He AIMS HIS RIFLE AT ROSSS STOMACH

Rosss mouth opens and closes but he makes no sound

-Hendricksson grabs his own rifle and points it at Ross --then

Becker

HENDRICKSSON
What the hells going on

i - ROSS”
(terrified and pleading)
Hes gone insane Stop hin
BECKER
We only knew about Variety Two

right Well now we know about
the other

Becker PRESSES THE TRIGGER WHITE HEAT BURSTS FROM THE GUN WITH

AN EARSHATTERING SOUND Ross HITS THE FLOOR SMOKING

HENDRICKSSON
Son of a bitch

BECKER
The other variety Now we know
both of them I was watching
I had a feeling Another minute
and it might have --

HENDRICKSSON
You had a feeling

Jessica pushes past him and bends over the steaming remains on
the ground

JESSICA
See for yourself Bones flesh

Hendricksson takes a fast look His eyes hardly leave Beckers
face Hes not surprised to see scarred flesh charred bone
fragments and ligaments Blood forms a pool

JESSICA (CONTD)
No wheels no parts no machinery
Not a viv Not another variety

Becker sits down all the color draining from his face He puts
his head in his hands and rocks back and forth

JESSICA (CONTD)
Why did you kill him

They are watching Becker intently He blubbers

HENDRICKSSON
Fear

JESSICA
Maybe Maybe not

HENDRICKSSON
You think different °°

JESSICA
Maybe Ross had learned something

BECKER
(white with fear)
You think Im the other variety
You think I killed him on purpose

HENDRICKSSON
Why then

BECKER
I thought he was a viv I thought I knew

HENDRICKSSON
Why

BECKER
Ive been watching him I was
suspicious

HENDRICKSSON
Why
I BECKER
I thought I saw something
Heard something
HENDRICKSSON
Heard what
BECKER
I thought I heard him -- ticking
Silence
Jessica picks up Rosss rifle Fragments of pink steaming flesh
Come away with it With a thoughtful appraising look she turns
it on Becker
HENDRICKSSON
Put that away
“” gEssrea
Better safe than sorry
HENDRICKSSON
f (expertly disarming her)
f No One is enough If we kill
( him well be doing what he did
a to Ross

BECKER
Thank you I was afraid You
understand that Now shes afraid
the way I was She wants to kill ne

HENDRICKSSON
No more killing Lets go

Hendricksson walks to the ladder He stops there and looks back
at Ross body He gazes at Ross as if seeing the depths of his

own soul

EXTERIOR ABOVE THE MOUSEHOLE NIGHT

Hendricksson sticks his head out Buglight blazing He shoves out
the transmitter and flips the antenna open

HENDRICKSSON
This is Bona Fide calling Simon Pure
Do you read me Come in Over

a

He switches over Nothing but violent static

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
This is Bona Fide calling Simon Pure
Do you read me Simon Come in Over

If anything the static is worse

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Elbarak or anyone if you hear
me the screamers have mutated
They now have one that looks
and acts like a little refugee boy

A bunch of them wiped out the entire
NEB Forward Command And theres
another type we dont know about yet
Were returning to Fort Apache now
and estimate arrival by 0600 Im
bringing two NEB survivors

Over and out

Grimly he folds the transmitter and-climbs up

EXTERIOR DRY ARROYO - NIGHT

Four figures moving toward the Alliance lines Hendricksson and
Becker in front side by side Dov his arm around Jessica
brings up the rear They look like a family parents in front
children at the back Three yellow helmet lamps light the way

HENDRICKSSON
Dont get any ideas Im a screamer
Pinhead

BECKER
It was a mistake

HENDRICKSSON

Ill kill you before you make another

ANGLE ON Dov and Jessica

DOV
Are you warm enough

JESSICA
Yes
747576

DOV
Dont step away from me My jammers
enly good for four meters

JESSICA
If I could get any closer to you I would

Dov misinterprets her statement as one of affection
He relishes the role of protector Besides shes a turn-on in
her sullen way

’ BECKER
What happens at your bunker

HENDRICKSSON
We negotiate

BECKER

(grimly)
Yeah Ill bet

‘ HENDRICKSSON
Shut up you paranoid asshole

DOV
(to Jessica)
Are you okay

JESSICA
Im all right Promise me Ill
be safe

DOV

Youll be safe Well get you to
the Alliance bunker

They hike in silence for a moment

Suddenly Becker LEAPS TO ONE SIDE FIRING wildly at something in
the rubble

We glimpse a SPINNING METAL SHAPE
HENDRICKSSON

(running forward)
What is it

BECKER
(sweat streaming
down his face)

It almost got me

Hendricksson takes a closer look

He stoops and holds up the object for all to see

zt is a mangled weather vane with a rusty iron rooster perched on
Op

HENDRICKSSON
(laughing)
A weather vane Good thing you got

iti

Becker blushes and scowls They resume their trudge forward two
by two Only the sound of their boots breaking the stillness

The silence is disturbed by a slight SOUND up ahead ALL four
STOP

A FAINT FIGURE emerges into the light of their helmet lamps It
looks large bulky muscular a MAN

Hendricksson is aiming at him So are Becker and Dov “
HENDRICKSSON
(authoritatively)
Identify

As the MAN limps nearer we see that he is a WOUNDED SOLDIER One
leg is missing and he hobbles with the aid of a pitiful homemade

crutch His face seens tired his journey endless

BECKER
Wait Hes NEB

HENDRICKSSON
Mendelsohn check if hes Clean

DOV
(sickened) -
Look at those radiation burns

HENDRICKSSON
Just do it Mendelsohn

Dov moves forward Jessica starts to go with him clinging to
his arm Hendricksson pulls her back

HENDRICKSSON
(to Dov)
Watch your step

Dov approaches the cripple
The NEB smiles and raises his hand

WHIRLING BLADES SPRING FROM HIS FINGERS RE SHOVES HIS ARM
STRAIGHT INTO DOVS CHEST AND OUT HIS BACK

With a dying SHRIEK of agony Dov collapses forward onto the
screamer slicing himself in two right up the middle

Jessica SCREAMS Hendricksson and Becker OPEN FIRE spraying the
robot with bullets They continue firing long after it is
shredded

“With their rifles raised they approach cautiously Jessica goes
to Dov Hendricksson and Becker make sure the screamer is dead

BECKER
Type One —

Then Hendricksson turns to examine Dov Dov is hideously dead
Hendricksson stoops and slips the JAMMER off Dovs wrist

CLOSE DOVS JAMMER Hendricksson presses a button on it and a
tiny screen lights up with the following

TEST POSITIVE

Hendricksson LOOKS at Becker and Jessica Becker understands the
significance

HENDRICKSSON
The jammer It completely ignored it
Its immune to the jammers

BECKER
(looking into
Hendricksson’ face)
Now its your turn

Hendricksson stares at the fallen screaner

HENDRICKSSON
We had to build them to learn
Ke

Hendricksson picks up Dovs rifle and ammunition pouch He hands
them to Jessica

Then he steps back from Dov He switches his multirifle to
FLAMETHROWER

HENDRICKSSON
They wont use Dov for parts

He incinerates Dov’s body When Dov has been reduced to a crisp
they pull him away

Hendricksson looks around gathering himself

They move on

EXTERIOR APPROACH TO THE ALLIANCE BUNKER DAY

The rising Sun is a dusty yellow against the crimson-red sky

Hendricksson Becker and Jessica stand looking at the RIDGE that
surrounds the Alliance bunker h

A DUST STORM is blowing up Its ferocity increases throughout
this scene

HENDRICKSSON
Just over that ridge

He gives a nod and they trudge up the slope Near the top he
gestures for them to lie down and they squirm the rest of the
way up on their bellies

- N -

The same ridge the NEB messenger died on 48 hours before They
lie prone peering over the ridge and down at the entrance to the
bunker fifty yards away Hendricksson sets up the transmitter

HENDRICKSSON
Bona Fide calling Simon Pure
Do you read me Over

There is no reply only STATIC He tunes the radio Squeals and
beeps and more hissing static come out of it

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
This is Bona Fide calling Simon Pure
Do you read me Simon Come in Over

‘ Nothing

— Hendricksson pulls out his field glasses and stares down at the
dark MOUTH of the bunker entrance

Nothing is there

-HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Were going to have to get closer

He looks down at Jessica who has Dovs rifle and ammo pouch

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
(to Jessica indicating
Dovs ammo pouch)
Careful of that pin Pull it and -
all the ammo goes up at once

He checks his own rifle
” HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
(sets his mouth)
All right

They rise and start down the slope’ retracing the steps of the
NEB runner Slipping and sliding in the ash

A simple-type screamer burrows up out of the ash and falls in
behind them following at a respectful distance Other little
screamers join the parade Becker and Jessica stick close to
Hendricksson eyeballing the screaners

-BUN -

Hendricksson stops a few feet short of the entrance
Becker and Jessica hug his elbows

“Hendricksson pulls out the RADIO again
co HENDRICKSSON

This is Bona Fide calling Simon
Pure Do you read me Simon Over

Dinly distorted a VOICE comes out of the radio

VOICE
This is Simon Over

HENDRICKSSON
Elbarak Is that you Over
aia’

Distant thin the VOICE is torn away by the rising dust storz

VOICE
This is Elbarak Over

HENDRICKSSON
Elbarak Listen Im back
Im standing right above you
on the surface

VOICE
Yes Over

The voice is unidentifiable through the static and moaning WIND
They all strain to listen
HENDRICKSSON

Is everything all right in the
bunker Over

VOICE
Everything is all right Over

He cranes his neck and tries to peer down into the bunker
opening Darkness there

HENDRICKSSON
Elbarak come up to the surface
I want to talk to you Over

VOICE
Come down Over

HENDRICKSSON
Why come down Ive given you an
order Over
There is no reply
HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Are you coming I order you to
come to the surface Over

VOICE
Come down

Hendricksson greasy face is screwed into a mask of concentration
and uncertainty

This is the tensest moment of his life

HENDRICKSSON
Elbarak Over

VOICE
Yes Over

HENDRICKSSON
Let me talk to Nick Over

There is a pause

VOICE
This is Nick Over

Thats it Hendricksson knows
He turns to Becker and Jessica He JERKS his thumb back the way
they came -- away from the bunker RETREAT

He picks up the radio
They start backing away from the bunker entrance
Hendricksson continuing to talk on the radio

HENDRICKSSON
(carrying radio) 7
Nick this is Simon How are

VOICE

HENDRICKSSON
(continuing to retreat)

VOICE

HENDRICKSSON

VOICE
Z will let you in Over
They are now twenty yards from the entrance and still backing up

HENDRICKSSON
Im coming down the steps now
Im just inside the entrance and
heading down Wait for my signal
Over

Hendricksson THROWS the radio away from hin

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Run ae

They turn and start RUNNING away from the bunker with every ounce
‘of strength in their bodies

They are almost to the top of the ridge -- a few more steps and
theyre over the top --
w- WHEN --

Behind them comes a hideous SCREAM

They stop and SPIN back toward the bunker entrance whipping up
their weapons

Up out of the bunker comes a DAVID its face expressionless
screaming its Hell-screan

Bendricksson and Becker OPEN FIRE BLASTING the David into screws
and springs

But hard on its heels an ARMY of DAVIDS swarms up out of the
bunker howling their blades spinning cutting the dust
The humans drop to one knee and start FIRING into the advancing

- yobots

The firepower is devastating
The Davids cant get close enough to use their blades

They are blown apart flinging burning debris for yards It is a
slaughter of machines
Suddenly Hendricksszon runs out of hard ammo
He re-sets his selector for FLAMETHROWER and sprays the Davids
with liquid flame
The Davids ignite the growing dust storm spinning the flames
They burn well

Suddenly a horde of CRIPPLED NEB SOLDIERS boils up out of the
bunker with all their blades out screaming

The humans fire into the mass of Crippled Soldiers which lumber
forward like human torches unbothered by the flames that engulf
then

Hideous burning androids attacking in the blinding dust storn
At that moment Hendrickssons rifle JAMS He tries to unjam it
Becker continues to fire covering Hendricksson

JESSICA STOPS firing

She takes out Dovs AMMO POUCH PULLS THE PIN and HURLS it
toward the main hatch oo

THE POUCH rolls and bounces down toward the entrance
A BURNING CRIPPLED SOLDIER stoops awkwardly to pick it up

IT EXPLODES

THE MAIN HATCH IS BLOWN APART

ANGLE ON HENDRICKSSON

sight of the others -- his rifle tumbling away from him

He lies in a pile of talus and rubble at the base of the slope
He is dazed his ears ring

In slow motion he tries to pick himself up

Pieces of rock and debris are raining down on him from the
explosion

JESSICA appears by his side

She grabs Hendrickssons arm and pulls him to his feet

She thrusts his rifle into his numb hands and starts dragging hin
away from the Alliance Forward Command

ANGLE JESSICA AND HENDRICKSSON

stumbling across the broken ground putting distance between
themselves and the bunker
She half-carries him he is still stunned

At a good distance from the bunker they reach an outcropping of
rock and drop behind it

Jessica and Hendricksson rest against the boulder exhausted
gasping for raw breath

HENDRICKSSON
(still dazed)
Wheres Becker

Jessica says nothing

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Did they get hin

Jessica does not answer She checks her rifle adjusting it

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Was he still alive when you left

Jessica meets his eyes

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
You left him on purpose

She scans the rubble behind then

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Why

JESSICA
Be still

Her RIFLE comes up
Hendricksson turns to follow her gaze
t

Out of the dust a FIGURE appears Walking unsteadily toward
them Limping
its clothes torn

It almost falls then steadies itself standing for a moment
Then it comes on

The dust swirls aside and we SEE
es Becker

HENDRICKSSON
(struggling to sit
upright)

Becker

JESSICA FIRES

The BLAST catches Becker FULL IN THE CHEST

Becker EXPLODES

For a moment he remains on his feet Headless

He takes one step --

-- then crashes to the ground his one remaining arm outflung
CHAINSAWS extend from the arm - long gleaming surgical steel

band cutters some of them still whining and plowing up the
ground Gears and wheels roll away

Silence

JESSICA -
Now you know why he killed Ross

Hendricksson says nothing Everything is slipping away from hin
faster and faster Darkness rolling and plucking at him

He closes his eyes

Slumps back onto the ground

HENDRICKSSON —
How did you know

JESSICA
I had always thought so

HENDRICKSSON
Why didnt you do something sooner

JESSICA
You wouldnt let me

oan HENDRICKSSON
t Three varieties

Hendricksson heaves himself over to the remains of Becker and
examines it

Wires and wheels and broken blades are festooned around like
spilled guts Almost the entire top half of the body has been
blown away leaving only a pelvis with legs one arm remains
attached to the pelvis by a bit of Beckers side

Hendricksson crawls back over to Jessica He looks at her
thoughtfully

She raises her rifle and places the muzzle against Hendrickssons
chest

JESSICA
Youre not one are you

HENDRICKSSON
No

JESSICA
Then why are you looking at
The that way 7
ok
HENDRICKSSON
woe Why are you looking at me

They stare at each other

JESSICA
Do we die here

Hendricksson pulls away from her angrily

HENDRICKSSON
No bitch

He climbs painfully to his feet

HENDRICKSSON
Come on lets go

JESSICA
Where
EXTERIOR - OPEN DESERT - DAY

( After the dust storm the morning is bright and clear The
Gesert is dazzlingly clean and suffocating under the weight of
the sun high in its zenith

HIGH ANGLE

Two dots lixe tiny black bugs are moving across the baked
flats They leave a trail like the crawling of a dying man

CLOSE They are hot dirty sweating Their gear is heavy

JESSICA
Where are we going

HENDRICKSSON

JESSICA
Whats that

HENDRICKSSON

Emergency Escape Vehicle
For the use of the Commanding
officer

JESSICA
Escape to where

Hendricksson says nothing

JESSICA (CONTD)
To Sanctuary

Hendricksson checks his radiation meter
a

HENDRICKSSON
Time to smoke

He fishes out two cigarettes and they walk sucking the blue
smoke deep into their lungs and holding it Soon they are
red-eyed and coughing

HENDRICKSSON
Elbarak used to like to amoke
this stuff I hate it
(beat)
You know what I liked about
Elbarak 1 could turn ay
dack on hia

Hendricksson stares morosely at the ground

HENDRICKSSON (CONTD)
Elbarak

He kicks another rock

Which SQUEALS and SCURRIES away It igs a mutated animal It turns
and HISSES at Hendricksson

Hendricksson emits a strangled CRY and OPENS FIRE on the
creature blowing it to pieces Blood and guts splatter for
yards Definitely not a machine -

Jessica STARES at him in amazement

HENDRICKSSON
(wild-eyed and trembling)
I hate things that arent what
theyre supposed to be -

He regains control of himself They resume walking
Hendricksson lights up another cigarette with shaking hands
Jessica watches him with a calculating expression There is a
fine frost of sweat on his brow The day is getting hotter

JESSICA
You know if I hadnt dragged
you away they would have got you
You would be dead Like Ross

HENDRICKSSON
Yes

JESSICA
Do you want to know why I saved
you I could have left you out
there
HENDRICKSSON

why did you save ze

JESSICA
Because I think you know how to
get us out of here

Hendricksson communes with his thoughts for a while

HENDRICKSSON
The location of Sanctuary is the
single most successfully kept
secret of the war The NEBs
have never broken that security

JESSICA
There are no more NEBs Theyre
all dead

Hendricksson looks around at the desert He takes a deep breath
and lets it out

HENDRICKSSON
Its on the other side of the planet
There are 95000 people there
Real people Were going there

JESSICA
Thanks

They trek on in silence Jessica has been examining Dovs rifle
turning it over in her hands

JESSICA (CONTD)
This is a beautiful gun The
construction is superb

CuT TO
EXTERIOR - EMPTY DESERT DAY

The sun glares down We hear a CREAKING METALLIC SOUND
Into the frame comes

TWO FEET

Then the rest of BECKER enters frame moving toward some
destination

What remains are two legs to walk with one arm to grab with and

an auxiliary brain in the butt ‘Thats what keeps it running
these things were designed with multiple brain units so they
could be blown into pieces and each separate part could still
function independently

Its a bizarre sight It plods due west leaving its footprints
in the sand

CcuT TO
EXTERIOR - TRINITY MISSILE COMPLEX - HIGH NOON

Here in the midst of the desert vastness is a solitary stone
MONUMENT like a grave marker On it is a metal placard
Inscibed on the placard are the words

TRINITY SITE
WHERE THE FIRST TRACES OF CARBONITE
WERE DISCOVERED ON SIRIUS 6B

JULY 16 2004

Hendricksson looks at the radiation meter on his wrist A look
of surprise appears on his face

HENDRICKSSON
Ill be damned -- A for Alfred
Zero This place is totally clean
We dont have to smoke

The first place in the entire story where there is no lethal
radiation

ANGLE ON HENDRICKSSON as he surveys the landscape

Jessica watches him Then he takes what looks like a metal credit

cara from his pocket

He kneels and inserts the card into a slot in the base of the
monument It emits a CLICK and the monument rolls aside

revealing
A CONCRETE STAIRWELL leading down into the earth

Jessica steps back

Ne HENDRICKSSON
(a humorless smile)
- Dont worry No tricks
JESSICA

Whats down there

HENDRICKSSON
Our ticket out of here

With sarcastic courtesy he gestures for her to enter first
Nervously she steps down into the black hole

INTERIOR TRINITY MISSILE COMPLEX DAY (NO WINDOWS)

They descend into a vast underground warren of concrete tunnels
and rooms

Flourescent lights shine air conditioning hums

Hendricksson presses a button and the hatch re-closes over their
heads THUNK —

Pn

Jessica looks around tensely

HENDRICKSSON
(voice echoing)
Its okay theres nobody here
Its been abandoned for years

aan

JESSICA
Why are the lights on -- and the
air conditioning

HENDRICKSSON
They cleared out in a hurry

They head down the spiral staircase

JESSICA
Why did they leave

Poe

HENDRICKSSON
To save their ass This place was
‘ obsolete before the war began

One particle beam could snake down

and shoot all the missiles out of
their silos like ducks in a pond

But its all been running

slicker than greased shit without a
single person in charge They really
knew how to build things in those days

Hendricksson opens a door and they walk through

He fishes a KEY from his pouch in his suit and opens a second
door labeled DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE

it has been many years since the door has been opened it CREAKS
noisily and flakes of rust shower down

- - W 3h

A closet-sized space
A large electrical transformer fills the room HUMMING loudly

Hendricksson takes out his metal card key and inserts it into a
SLOT in the transformer Presently there is a low GRATING SOUND
and the entire transformer separates from the floor and RISES up
into the ceiling revealing a metal LADDER leading DOWN into
another roon

HENDRICKSSON
Go on

Jessica mounts the ladder and starts down
- v - Ww W

The chamber houses four sleek little SPACECRAFT no bigger than
gspeedboats They rest at the bottom of long RAMPS which run up
to closed HATCHES ‘overhead

HENDRICKSSON
There they are

JESSICA reacts to the prospect of imminent escape She moves
quickly to the nearest escape ship and looks in through the
cockpit

Something DISTURBS her

JESSICA
There is only one seat

HENDRICKSSON
But there are four ships

JESSICA
ZI cant fly one of these

HENDRICKSSON
The controls are automatic
You just push the Launch button
and it takes you to Sanctuary
When youre in range
you start broadcasting a beacon and
theyll come pick you up If they
have trouble finding you you have
a set of signal flares

He crosses to a locker and opens it Inside are four PRESSURE
SUITS He takes two of them out and hands one to Jessica

HENDRICKSSON
Put it on Its meant to go over
your clothes

Jessica starts putting on the space suit a simple process it
was designed to go on in a hurry While shes doing this
Hendricksson goes to a CONSOLE on one wall and inserts his card

“key

The console comes to life He starts going through the PRE-LAUNCH
SEQUENCE SUNLIGHT flares in from above as one of the concrete
HATCHES slides open with a scraping noise Dust and bits of
concrete filter down

One of the EEVs is RELEASED from its BERTHING CLAMPS -- the
two huge steel JAWS that hold the ship firmly against accidental
Jaunch The clamps PIVOT OPEN freeing the ship for takeoff
The GULL-WING DOOR on the E£EV POPS OPEN invitingly

Hendricksson goes to the escape craft and reaches inside
pressing his thumb to a silvery square in the instrument panel
All the instruments LIGHT UP and we hear a hydraulic

whoosh from the ship

RENDRICKSSON
(satisfied)
Shes ready to go

He returns to the console and starts typing in
Ser ther neat shin yping the instructions

Nothing

Concerned he punches several wore buttons rapidly
Still nothing prey

He checks his CARD
Then he realizes

HENDRICKSSON

JESSICA
Whats wrong

HENDRICKSSON
Oh Sweet Jesus

JESSICA —

Hendricksson slumps over the console

Jessica is shaking

JESSICA
Why cant we both fit in yours

HENDRICKSSON
Impossible

JESSICA
Lets try

HENDRICKSSON
It wont work

SESSICA

HENDRICKSSON

They look at each other
Only one of them is getting on that ship and they both know it

Hendricksson takes a COIN from his pocket

HENDRICKSSON

Call it
Jessica stares at him

JESSICA

HENDRICKSSON)
You go

JESSICA
Tails

The coin hits the floor RINGING like a chime
It rolls into a SHADOW

before HENDRICKSSON can pick it up Jessica THROWS her GLOVE over

Their EYES lock

She walks to the pre-launch console

and pulls Hendrickssons card key out of its slot

The launch dies and the overhead hatch RUMBLES SHUT cutting off
the dirty sunlight

Watching Hendricksson she begins to remove her spacesuit
She steps out of it hangs it over a railing
Pulls off her NEB army shirt and drops it on the floor

Her body is pale but supple

She steps out of her trousers and kicks them away
All the time watching Hendricksson without blinking
Hendricksson Grinks her in

Hastily Hendricksson removes his battle unifora
They stand nude before each other

They RUSH into each others arms kissing groping inflamed with
animal passion

They fall to the cold cement and begin to make violent love
Their sweaty bodies intertwined

Licking sucking biting scratching drawing blood

HIGH ANGLE

ef the two bodies snaking on the floor of the launch chamber
moaning writhing crying out

CLOSE Red- -faced grimacing they pour with sweat veins stand
out on their foreheads

They begin to gasp rythmically

At that culminating moment

« « They hear the SOUND OF METALLIC CLANKING
They TEAR AWAY from each other to SEE
BECKERS REMAINS

The MONSTROUSLY DAMAGED FIGURE stands only ten feet away

a PAIR OF LEGS with ONE ARM groping its way with very poor
sensory equipment

GLOWING hideously with shimmering LASER LIGHT cast from severed
bundles of fiber optics

It almost FALLS
SWAYING back and forth trying to steady itself

SCREAMING CHAINSAWS SPRING from its solitary ARM
It STAGGERS unsteadily toward the naked humans
groping REACHING for them

CHIPS of CONCRETE FLY as

the whirling SAWS graze the wall F

Hendricksson SCRAMBLES toward his RIFLE

but the robot is between him and his weapon

He grabs the nearest object -- a WRENCH -

and HURLS it at the monster knocking off three FINGERS
a

Instantly it reads the direction of the throw and LUNGES at
Hendricksson

Jessica SCREAMS at it

JESSICA
Becker

The thing TURNS toward the sound of her VOICE away fron
Hendricksson

Jessica RUNS and GRABS up her RIFLE from the floor swings it
onto Becker and PULLS THE TRIGGER

It BEEPS
She STARES down at it
It says

RELOAD ALL CHAMBERS

Jessica BACKS AWAY as the Becker-thing gropes toward ‘her

She backs toward the EEV

stepping BETWEEN the two ‘huge BERTHING DOORS that surround the
ship

Hendricksson throws himself onto the PRE-LAUNCH CONSOLE and
SHOVES his CARD back into the slot REACTIVATING IT It lights

up

Jessica keeps retreating

JESSICA
Over here Becker

As the robot lumbers toward Jessica its buzzsaw arm
outstretched about to TOUCH HER about to SINK its blades into
her naked breast it STEPS between the HUGE CHROME BERTHING
DOORS

Hendricksson SLAMS his hand down on the SWITCH and the GIANT
DOORS PIVOT SHUT CRUSHING BECKER FLAT

THE BECKER-THING EMITS A FINAL SHRIEK TWITCHES EXPLODES and
DIES

It HANGS there between the clamps crushed to a thickness of two
inches smoking and dropping screws and bolts Hendricksson and
Jessica fly into each others arms sobbing with relief and joy
He holds her tightly pressing the length of his body against
hers It is a moment of great triumph for the human beings
my

Finally they separate

Hendricksson walks to the remains of Becker ‘jammea between the
oors

He peels off a familiar PLATE

Be takes it to the pre-launch console and inserts it into the
computer

The computer SCANS it

The screen lights up with the words

AUTONOMOUS MOBILE SWORD REVISED
TYPE 4
Hendricksson FROWNS

HENDRICKSSON
Type Four
(beat)
Then what the hell is Type Three

JESSICA HITS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF HER RIFLE

Hendricksson COLLAPSES TO THE FLOOR STUNNED

He lies on the cold concrete the world a red haze as Jessica
goes to the pre-launch console and opens the OVERHEAD LAUNCH
DOOR exposing the sxy

She leans into the EEV and thumbs the plate that lights up the
instrument board

Then she walks over and stands above Hendricksson still totally
nude

JESSICA
A beautiful ship Well built
I admire your workmanship
You people have always done
good work You build fine things

Hendricksson RAISES HIS HEAD and looks up at her

Blood is running from his scalp and dripping down onto the floor
His last vision is her inscrutable FACE

Then darkness swallows him

FADE TO BLACK

EADE UP
Hendricksson comes to

Groggily he raises his head
He touches his skull
He grimaces and GROANS
Gluey black blood has congealed in his hair and down his cheek

He lurches to his feet swaying

Abruptly he throws up

Wiping his mouth he looks around woozily y-

Gray sunlight streams in through the open ceiling hatch

It seems to be late afternoon

The EEV -- the Emergency Escape Vehicle the one coded to his
card key -- is gone Its ramp is scorched and blackened

The remains of Becker lie on the floor by the base of the ramp
where the jaws of the berthing cradle dropped him to let the
EEV take off

Hendricksson sways over to his spacesuit still lying where he
dropped it
Shakily he pulls it on

Carrying his pressure helmet under one arm and his rifle under
the other he climbs painfully back up the ladder into the
transformer roon

He pushes the door open and walks into the corridor

ie) Ww
He moves down the corridors gun raised eyes flicking around

As he rounds a corner he comes to an abrupt HALT
as he SEES

A LIZARD
squatting in his path looking up at him with luminous eyes

He LOOKS back at it
It turns and SCURRIES away in terror

A SHADOW moves

Hendrickssons head SNAPS UP and he PEERS ahead
SOMETHING is coming
WALKING through the shadows up ahead

He STRAINS to see
Sweat drips into his eyes

Figures
Figures coming along the dimly lit corridor
Coming toward hin

’ He CROUCHES aiming his rifle
Wipes the sweat from his eyes
fighting rising PANIC

as the FIGURES near

Inte the light step
TWO JESSICAS

standing side by side silent

Both identical TWINS

NEB army pants jacket long lank hair
lustrous dark eyes

Beautiful expressionless identical

He FIRES

Opening up with everything hes got

‘Rockets and flechettes and needlespray --

jets of microscopic darts that shred what they touch

The shrieking jet-engine WHISTLE of the gun --

-- the face of Hendricksson drawn back into a MASK of fear and
loathing and hatred --

the bodies of the JESSICAS twitching and flopping

with puffs of DUST bursting off them atomized

plastic and metal

When the dust has settled the bodies of the Jessicas are strewn
in countless pieces smouldering and crackling no longer
recognizable as anything at all

Hendrickssons rifle is red hot
Shaking with rage he begins RELOADING rapidly spilling some of
the bullets on the floor

JESSICAS VOICE
Wait

STARTING VIOLENTLY as if stabbed with a hot poker he JERKS his
head up

A Jessica stands before him holding up her hands signaling hin
to HOLD HIS FIRE

JESSICA CLONE
Dont fight us Were the beginning
of a new species The race to come
after Man

HENDRICKSSON
Youre not a race Youre machines
Mechanical killers We made you
that way You look like people
but youre machines

SESSICA CLONE
So it seems now But what
about later when there is no
more life to destroy Then our
true potentials will begin to emerge

HENDRICKSSON
(shakily)
Youll never destroy all life

JESSICA CLONE
Theres no life left on Sirius
except microorganisms and you
The only remaining pocket of human
life is at Sanctuary and our
sister is halfway there by now

HENDRICKSSON
Theres only one of her

JESSICA CLONE
It only takes one She
carries a thermonuclear bomb
HE OPENS FIRE blowing the Jessica to kingdom come

With energy born of fury he grabs his space helmet and STRIDES
from the scene of devastation Lo

Crammed with computers and screens and big boards

Hendricksson strides in moving with increasing urgency

He goes to the main console and starts throwing the power

The room starts humming and clicking coming to life after years
of dormancy

He selects a computer terminal and starts PECKING KEYS
The screen LIGHTS UP

Hendricksson curses to himself and pecks more keys
Again the screen blinks with the same repetitive message
PLEASE IDENTIFY

Hendricksson pounds the control console in frustration and types
in his name He pecks more keys

Hendricksson FIRES at the computer screen in frustration and
leaves the room

INTERIOR - LAUNCH CHAMBER DAY

Hendricksson strides into the chamber and picks up the crushed
remains of Becker
He rifles through the tangled mess of wires and servo-motors
until he finds the CHIP BOARD he is looking for

He strides over to the computer console and tears off the back
cover
a

He scans the banks of chips and circuitry and rips out two small
boards replacing them with the board from Beckers remains

Ke punches in some commands into the console and smiles as one of
the trap-doors slides open

Hendricksson puts on his spacesuit and gloves and strides over to
one of the EEVs

-He aims his rifle at the hydraulic hoses connected to the

berthing-clamps and FIRES
With a loud HISSING the pressure is released and the clanups
open releasing the craft

Hendricksson strides over to the EEV under the open trap-door
and grabs a red handle labelled EMERGENCY USE ONLY and opens
the canopy with a WHOOSH

He straps himself in shutting the door behind him and punches
in commands which cause the craft to hum into life

Hendricksson punches in a final” sequence of commands and braces
himself for launching

A tiny white dot in the middle of the flares

The distance is CLOSING RAPIDLY but as he GETS NEARER the
