EXT UNDERWATER - DAY

Above sharp against the waves the silhouette of a
young boy - LEO He floats motionless at the centre
of the light fantastic the blue chop riven with
sunlight It is beautiful A moment of serenity

-And then the cloud begins to form seeping out from
him out from his head neck and chest thick and red
against the crystal water

Another shape appears the hull of a motorboat a thin
haze of red trailing out from its blades as frenzied
hands paddle towards the boy

CUT TO
EXT MOTORBOAT LAKE - WEST GERMANY 2006 - CONTINUOUS

A young blonde WOMAN - hands over her face - tries to
stifle her sobs as her BOYFRIEND grabs frantically at
LEO hauling him out of the water

She desperately looks around for help and finds herself
staring at a lone figure on the shore a frozen sixteen
year-old dressed in a simple brown dress with a bonnet
as if from a different era - SYBILLE - staring back in
rigid shock from the beach

CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY

The echo of footsteps fill the corridor as the BOYFRIEND
from the boat runs towards the emergency desk LEO
clutched to his chest LEO’S eyes remain unfocused

SYBILLE runs behind them terrified as she watches LEOS
blood spatter across the floor

CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

SYBILLE sits on a bench across from the door She
watches a DOCTOR enter the room and approach her MOTHER
a pale slight woman dressed as simply as her daughter
and sat next to LEOS bed

The boys throat is bandaged and his mouth caked with
blood

SYBILLE can barely make out the murmurs and half-
descriptions above the noise of the hospital as the
American military DOCTOR has his words translated into
German by his ASSISTANT

DOCTOR
Severe trauma to the throat and mouth
vocal chords severed major internal

tissue damage

A nurse sees that SYBILLE is listening in and gently
closes the door Through the window we see Leo’s MOTHER
is upset She wont agree to what the DOCTOR is
suggesting She wants to get her son and leave as soon
as possible The DOCTOR looks exasperated and shakes
his head as she leaves the room

Leo’s MOTHER sees SYBILLE standing teary-eyed in the
hallway She walks over and pulls SYBILLE into a tight
hug

MOTHER (ENGLISH SUBTITLE)
He’ll be fine We just need to get him
home God will heal him

On the bedside table is a notepad a pencil attached
with string Written in hard scripted text is a single
word

INT SWIMMING POOL - DAY

The length of the pool is a mosaic of screens showing
footage of dolphins and fish racing alongside the
oblivious swimmers

LEO now in his forties swims powerfully With
purpose As he finishes a length he smoothly flips
around revealing a series of angled scars from his
abdomen up to his throat

He is a big man his face hammered by a life of
experience he has taken a punch or two over the years
both literally and figuratively

He reaches the end of another length the water thrashed
to foam behind him He flips around against the edge of
the pool and takes a huge lung-full of air then plunges
underwater and pushes off against the side

He powers along beneath the water for almost three-
quarters of the pool before breaking the surface again
When he reaches the far side he stops to catch his
breath

INTEXT CAREAST BERLIN 2046 - EVENING

Berlin is carved out of shadows pools of sodium green
and yellow shape nooks and crannies at the street level
of the city Flickering neon the only real life here
Above the city stretches upwards towards affluence and
light

There is still a recognizable Berlin here but one that
technology has grown on like moss on a rock Buildings
retrofitted and re-purposed an old city remoulded for a
new era

Leo scratches at the base of his neck a few inches
below a deep scar at his throat

He is parked up in a 40 year-old Bentley a car as
battered and worn with character as himself watching an
unassuming doorway on the opposite side of the street

CUT TO
INTEXT CARBERLIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

A striking young Afghan woman walks out of the doorway
and starts up the street Her name is NAADIRAH - mid-
twenties

LEO starts the car and follows her at a distance
smiling gently as he watches her walk

NAADIRAH oblivious to his presence turns a corner and
LEO drives on At the next corner he backtracks and
comes out at the top end of the street NAADIRAH took
She sees him approach and crosses the road to meet him

LEO smiles and opens the door NAADIRAH gets in and
kisses him caressing his face LEO mimes eat and
NAADIRAH nods Then she clicks that he has arrived from
an odd direction

NAADTIRAH
Are you late

LEO grins kisses her and drives off
CUT TO
INT CHEAP RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The place is inexpensive but still making the effort
LEO and NAADIRAH are tucked away in a booth

NAADIRAH talks animatedly as she eats her voice
smothered by the sounds of the cafe LEO watches her as
he toys with his food his smile a beam of contentment

MUTE - revised 6th March 2009
MUTE - LIBERTY FILMS DUNCAN JONES 4

As NAADIRAH talks she reaches for the pepper and douses
her food with it She fails to notice a cloud of it
falling into her glass of water LEO does notice and
immediately exchanges his glass for hers

NAADIRAH
Yuri talked to me the other night

She looks up waiting for his reaction Another forkful
of food disappears into NAADIRAHS mouth leaving a
smear of sauce on her face LEO leans over and wipes it
off

NAADIRAH (CONTD)
He says as long as we don’t smooch in
front of the customers you can have the
job

NAADIRAH reaches up and takes his hand kissing it
gently They look deep into each others eyes and she
smiles

She reaches into her bag and pulls out a small clever-
looking pink phone wanting to film a clip of the two of
them together LEO hides his face in his hand clearly
uncomfortable

As she switches on the camera an image appears on the
glass window of the restaurant beside them The words
“Select as screen” glow lime-green Almost every
surface is now a cheap proxy monitor for ones gadgets
and NAADIRAH taps the window sending her camera image
to it

She comes round to LEO’S side of the table leans in and
records until LEO can bare it no more and gently folds
his thick hand over the lens She whines He kisses
her

Music hammers in loud enough to split stone

INT FOREIGN DREAMS STRIP BAR MAIN LOUNGE - NIGHT

Two hands skim across bottles and glasses a blur of
efficiency

LEO - the barman - fields the stream of orders without a
hint of pressure Though the words are lost beneath the
music LEO turns to indicate bottle or draught points
to ice holds up fingers to clarify measures - cool
calm and collected This is a man not bound by his
disability but defined by it

The place is heaving and knows its clientéle with the
full spectrum of foreign exotic women dancing on stage
and in the laps of the men themselves

Centre of attention an “object d’art” an animatronic
robot silver and straight out of a Hajime Sorayama
portfolio She dances an endless loop on sculpted
impossibly long artificial limbs

A tray of empty glasses arrive at the end of the bar
deposited by the waitress - NAADIRAH LEO turns and
puts several prepared drinks onto the tray He presses
a final glass of cola into NAADIRAHS hand with a wink

As a DANCER on stage finishes her routine and leaves to
polite applause two English BUSINESSMEN at a stage-
front table turn and start hollering at NAADIRAH for
their drinks She rolls her eyes with a smile towards
LEO drains her glass and sets off with the tray

As she places the drinks on the BUSINESSMENS table one
of them tries to push money into her top She guides
his hand away and makes him drop the note on the tray

Another waitress - LUBA an Albanian girl in her
twenties - waves NAADIRAH over They slip out through a
side-door

LUBA
Hows Leo

NAADIRAH

(seeing her expression)
Oh fuck off Luba I dont care what you

The bar manager - YURI a large Russian in his sixties -
has appeared in the corridor There is something stoic
and a little melancholy about him a man who was once
much more He stands next to LUBA until she is so
uncomfortable it is impossible to ignore him

LUBA (CONTD)
Yuri Its our break

YURI
(taking her cigarette)
No Out

The two girls go back through the door LUBA sticking
her tongue out at YURI He nods impassively and stubs

NAADIRAH walks through and runs straight into one of the
BUSINESSMEN standing by the entrance to the toilets
He drunkenly propositions her waving money under her
nose She shakes her head and tries to walk past but he
moves to stop her

LEO witnesses this from the bar and looks around the
room for help but the two BOUNCERS are stood on the far
side of the stage chatting up one of the DANCERS
oblivious to NAADIRAHS situation

Back at the toilets the BUSINESSMAN tries to push money
into NAADIRAHS top again at the same time putting his
hand on her arse

LEO rockets out from behind the bar and storms across
the room The next thing the BUSINESSMAN knows he is
being manhandled through the door into the mens
toilets

CUT TO
INT LEOS FLAT BEDROOMKITCHEN - NIGHT
Leo’s flat is small and Spartan Almost monastic

LEO’s sat on the edge of his bed there is little but an
old fashioned vinyl record player in the corner of the
cheap room White rimmed photographs framed on the wall
show him and his family over the years Images of him
as a Berlin teen playing baseball at some US army meet
and greet smacking a home-run traveling with his
mother and sister on holiday in the Alps at a retreat
with a number of other families dressed in out of period
clothing tucked in the corner of a framed newspaper
page a picture of his father in a uniform of some sort
The newspaper headline exclaiming the founding of an
Amish Israel in Germany

He stares at the framed picture he is holding in his
lap

It is a photograph of NAADIRAH standing in front of a
lake-side pier smiling Written underneath

Found You x

LEO gets up and walks through to the kitchen He goes
to the sink takes a pint glass off the draining board
and fills it to the brim from the tap He then proceeds
to drink the whole thing in one go

He goes to the window Holds the blind open looking
down at the street below a road sweeper all vents and
articulation attacks the day’s debris No sign of
NAADTIRAH

He drops the needle on an old record music filling the
room lies down and closes his eyes

INT LEOS FLAT BEDROOMHALLWAY - LITTLE LATER

LEO opens his eyes Was there a noise He jolts
upright The record player is replaying the same
scratched segment again and again but there was
something else

He lifts the needle

A moment then he hears it sobbing a quiet knock
then more sobs

LEO opens the front door to find NAADIRAH sitting on the
floor outside she has clearly been crying

NAADIRAH
I shouldnt be here

LEO gently pulls her up and into the flat and closes the
door

He sits NAADIRAH down on the bed and kneels on the floor
in front of her reaching up to wipe her eyes

NAADIRAH (CONTD)
Something happened tonight

NAADIRAH falters tears welling up again A look of
concern floods LEOS face and he immediately starts
pawing at her checking to see if she is injured - takes
her phone Tries to hand it to her but she wont take
it He dials 110 - the emergency services and puts
it to her ear She reaches for the phone and cancels
the call

NAADIRAH (CONTD)
Im not hurt

She falters and starts to cry LEO tries to embrace her
but she stops him

NAADIRAH (CONTD)
(regaining a little composure)
Leo I need to tell you something
Someone I need to tell you about
someone

LEO puts a finger to her mouth He points to her then
makes his hands fly away

NAADIRAH (CONTD)
No No Im not leaving But I have to
tell you something about me God Leo
the last thing I want to do is leave you

Leo puts a finger to her mouth again He tries to say
something but cannot find the gestures He reaches into
his pocket and takes out a little notepad with a pencil
in the spine and writes

Then nothing else is important

NAADIRAH smiles then starts crying again Leo wraps
his arms around her - an awkward hunched embrace filled
with passion NAADIRAH hangs limply in his arms

LEO lies on the bed NAADIRAH on top of him wrapped in a
towel They kiss - a kiss that could end the world

NAADTIRAH
I need to tell you something

LEO slips his hand under her towel and kisses her to
stop her talking She holds his head in both hands and
sighs giving up for now

She reaches over to the light switch Clicks
Blackness

CUT TO
INT LEOS FLAT BEDROOM - LATER STILL

A heaving bellow of breath LEO can see his arm
stretched out like a tree trunk falling into the space
beside him - the space where NAADIRAH should be She is
not there But something is in the room

The place is dark sucked of colour LEO cannot move
but through drugged eyes watches a FIGURE in the shadows
beyond the bed It moves in pulses frozen one instant
and then oozing forward a moment later it looks like
God keeps hitting the search button on some celestial
remote

LEO breathes heavily and the shape moves again Still
nothing makes sense Awake or asleep

LEO rolls over his arm falling into the space beside
him He opens his eyes NAADIRAH is not there

LEO looks across at NAADIRAHS photograph by the bed He
checks his watch the analogue hands ticking with Swiss
precision He’s slept in

Still a little shaken by his nightmare he goes to the
kitchen and downs a pint of water

CUT TO
EXT BUSY EAST BERLIN STREET - DUSK

The city bustles humanity from all parts of Europe
grinding past each other

Amidst them large intimidating sales reps branded as
the “Eurocorps sales team” approach passers-by They
make the hard sell asking random pedestrians if they
would like to upgrade their “Eurocorps customer rating”
They don’t bother asking LEO There are meeker looking
prey to pick from

LEO stops at a newsstand taps on the counter pointing
at a newspaper logo He is offered a download but
declines The newsie shrugs dusts off an old printer
on a shelf and prints him out a copy

LEO walks into a cheap greasy-spoon cafe carrying his
old fashioned print and pulp newspaper

LEO gives him the thumbs-up and finds himself a table
taking care to face away from the television where a
row of men (multiple SAM BELLS from the film MOON)
give a deposition to a panel LEO pulls out a small
notepad and pencil and carefully places it on the table
next to him as he waits for the OWNER to bring his food

glances at Leo reading his newspaper

and sticks his fingers up to indicate “a little bit”

The owner grins turns the TV off as he goes back behind
the counter

Another customer enters His name is CACTUS BILL - A
thick-moustachioed American in his thirties a man who
looks like he is permanently amused by some private
joke He sits down at a table side-on to LEO and starts
staring at him - the kind of stare your mother would
tell you off for

LEO ignores him just continues with his newspaper
CACTUS gets up and walks towards the counter

CACTUS BILL
(a bit drunk)
Hey pal what do you have to do to get
some service around these parts

The occasional police vehicle and MAXI-TAXI float past

cant afford such luxuries

Confused and miserable LEO heads for home walking
under the yellow sodium lights of East Berlin moving
into a quieter poorer neighbourhood

He passes BERLIN CITY FARM TOWER 2 a vast circular

Inside is a presentation box and a mobile phone A gift

A half-conscious PATIENT with a blood-drenched leg lies
moaning on the operating table reacting to the pokes
and prods of CACTUS BILL and DONALD DUCK TEDDINGTON -
a blond lank American in his thirties who wears metal
rimmed John Lennon-style glasses They are both gowned
and masked

YURI and a second Russian AKIM are wrapped up in a
game of chess at the table in the corner

CACTUS BILL
(mumbling)
Can you clamp that

DUCK
(also mumbling)
Where I cant see the- oh I get it
You know what we need to just cut these
pants right off

CACTUS pulls a hunting knife out of a sheath on his belt
and cuts off the offending trousers He dumps them into
an old army duffel bag under the operating table

DUCK pushes a clamp into the now-unobstructed wound

CACTUS BILL
I can see the shell I just cant

The PATIENT spasms in pain

CACTUS BILL (CONTD)
Okay okay I see Give him some weight
Duck

DUCK presses down hard on the PATIENTS hip and knee as
CACTUS digs into him and drags out a bullet He drops
the bullet into a metal dish by his feet It makes a
ting noise and bounces out

CACTUS BILL (CONTD)
(peeved)
One-zip

YURI looks up from his game as the PATIENTS cries
subside

DUCK
(snaking out a suction tube)
You know I can fit a cable in there if

I see no thirty-eight I see a forty-

DUCK

He digs into the PATIENT again who reacts more
violently this time

CACTUS BILL
Juice him again

DUCK picks up a hypodermic and jabs it into the
PATIENTS arm He drifts further into unconsciousness
CACTUS does a histrionic snip-snip with his instrument
before plunging back into the PATIENTS thigh

DUCK
I don’t see why you would put in all that
effort to save a bit of sinew I could
have fit three guys with rayon by now

CACTUS BILL
This isn’t field surgery Donald it’s

DUCK

CACTUS pulls out another bullet and drops it Ting
This one stays in the dish prompting a small cheer from
CACTUS and DUCK

complete with olive He closes the freezer and then the
cupboard door Leaning against it he faces YURI
keeping the Russian between him and DUCK piggy in the

CACTUS walks over to the operating table and retrieves
the soiled duffel bag from underneath it He stops the
Russians carrying their comrade up the basement stairs

At the top of the stairs he checks a small video screen
Flips through the various feeds in the house ‘till he
finds one of a little girl in bed Quietly he opens the

He comes to a halt in OSWALDS bedroom

On the bed are a pair of boys frozen like statues in the
middle of a sexual act Not exactly human boys a
pair of next generation Real Dolls with extra sexual
organs They look like something designed by the

LEO turns away Begins to search the room

In a vast walk in closet he finds a shelf festooned with
photographs of women - prostitutes - in various states
of undress Among them is a photo of NAADIRAH the same
one he has of her standing on the beach

OSWALD finds him looking at the pictures

photo of NAADIRAH Reality batters its way through
there is now no ignoring the fact that NAADIRAH is a
prostitute He carefully removes the photo from its
frame and puts it into his pocket He then starts
taking out the pictures of the other girls

forced to drive on

CUT TO
INT STEAMU-STEAMU RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Steamu-Steamu is a Heston Blumenthal wet-dream gone fast
food It’s the shabu-shabu of the future Rather than
cooking your food in a community pot of boiling water
you sear it in a jet of flavoured steam There are only
a few people eating but its a noisy affair with each
table focussed around steam jets that customers cook
and flavour their food in

A pair of intimidating men enter and order at the
counter They nod to NICKY as they pass he is clearly
uncomfortable at their presence These two HARD-NUTS
sit and begin eating at a table in the corner across
the room from where NICKY is sitting with TANYA MAKIKO
and JOSIE

TANYA and MAKIKO are fussing around JOSIE like shes a
doll JOSIE is ignoring them sat at the table eating
chips in single file and drawing a picture of a bear
NICKY SIMSEK noisily steams and munches as he talks to
the girls in English

NICKY SIMSEK
So your dad’s taking you to America
huh I’ve been to America

LEO enters the restaurant and walks straight over
towards the group NICKY looks up to see LEO standing
motionless next to his table NICKY speaks in German

NICKY SIMSEK (ENG SUBTITLE) (CONTD)
Can I help you

LEO just looks back and forth between NICKY and JOSIE
The two girls watch him nervously

JOSIE looks up at LEO His two black eyes resemble the
way she has drawn the eyes on her picture of the bear
She looks him directly in the eye and smiles at him
then looks down and continues drawing

LEO ignores NICKY and sits down at the table next to
JOSIE NICKY watches in astonishment as LEO takes out
his own notepad and starts drawing

JOSIE tears off her picture of the bear and offers it to
LEO He smiles and takes it

NICKY laughs nervously

NICKY SIMSEK (CONTD)
What is this Fucking art class

LEO stares hard at NICKY then returns to his drawing
The two girls fidget very nervous now NICKY takes out
his mobile

NICKY SIMSEK (CONTD)

(glances at Josie then back to Leo)
What do you want

LEO ignores him and continues to draw

NICKY SIMSEK(CONTD)
You two take the kid and get out of here

TANYA gets up and puts JOSIES coat on while MAKIKO
picks up her packet of chips

LEO finishes his drawing tears it off and gives it to
JOSIE She looks at it

It is a picture of a bear this one holding a smaller
bear by the hand

JOSIE smiles at LEO again as TANYA carries her away

LEO spears a piece of raw meat from NICKYS tray and
starts to steam it The two HARD-NUTS across the
restaurant glance over

NICKY SIMSEK (ENG SUBTITLES)

visibly disturbing the guy He reaches into his pocket

NICKY SIMSEK (CONTD)

LEO produces his photo of NAADIRAH and puts it on the
table in front of NICKY NICKY relaxes

NICKY SIMSEK (CONTD)
Oh I see Bit kinky huh

LEO bangs on the table cutting short NICKYS laughter
and then points at the picture The thugs across the
room are watching intently now Its all making NICKY
agitated and LEO notices

NICKY SIMSEK (ENG SUBTITLE) (CONTD)

Fuck off I dont even know what youre
on about

LEO grabs his arm and holds up a finger He takes out
his notepad and writes something NICKY cannot help but
be interested He reads the English words does Maksim
know

NICKY looks around nervously and sits down again

NICKY SIMSEK (CONTD)

Does he know what You speak English
Who the fuck are you You work for
Maksim

(his eyes narrow)
If hes got something to say to me he
can tell me himself Im not some

LEO stands up stares at Nicky NICKY grins

NICKY SIMSEK (CONTD)

In a flash LEO grabs NICKY’S WRIST
NICKY is terrified Thinks its going in the steam

But LEO empties a handful of Oswalds crumpled money out
of his own pocket and piles it into NICKY’S hand NICKY
slides down in his chair trying to make himself less
noticeable

The two HARD-NUTS stare at NICKY focused but
emotionless taking it all in

NICKY SIMSEK (ENG SUBTITLE) (CONTD)

Whoa Thats not even fucking mine

LEO glances at the HARD NUTS Picks up the photo and
puts it away NICKY acknowledges the implied threat

NICKY SIMSEK (CONTD)

(hissing)
Look all I know is she was planning
something

(fishing in his pocket)
She had me send part of her money to some
address I just assumed it was something
put aside from her earnings

and urgently searches through it

forward to retrieve the PDA LEO slips his hand in
shaking NICKY’S hand to his horror

LEO smiles at NICKY who is trying to keep up with
what’s going on As LEO leaves he puts his finger to
his lips then gives a friendly nod to the HARD-NUTS
They ignore him eyes fixed unblinking on NICKY
NICKY is at a loss realizing how this must look His
eyes dart from the money to the closing door and back
again taking a furtive detour across the two HARD-NUTS

find that instead of the love-nest he was expecting
the place is actually an office

sideways

closes a crack

PETER (CONTD)

The place is a mess sheets of paper everywhere a wall
of files in disarray half-eaten food It looks like

He slowly feels his way to the desk Confident that LEO
isnt going to attack him he grabs a small can of mace
from the drawer and desperately tries to spray it at
LEO

But LEO is on him and has PETERS bony hand clutched in
his own before the lawyer can do any damage The mace
squirts out at the wrong angle missing both of them
LEO tears the can out of PETERS hand and throws it
across the room PETER is terrified as LEO grabs him by
the collar

As he finishes DUCK sees LEO’S face No chance of
conversation there then

DUCK (CONTD)
(to himself)
Fuck Josie Hey honey you know how to
turn on the radio How about you find us
something fun

JOSIE presses the switch The journey continues to the
madness of German wee-hour broadcasting Wayne Newton
starts singing Dankaschoen DUCK looks across at the
little girl

DUCK (CONTD)
Well you may have your fathers eyes
but you sure aint much of a
conversationalist Come on This is
fun

LEO tries to move but the drug continues to paralyse
him DUCK glances back at him again then smiles

DUCK (CONTD)

(to Josie

He reaches into his pocket

DUCK (CONTD)
Now that youre a big girl I thought you
better have this seeing as this is what
big girls have

He pulls out the mobile phone - NAADIRAHs pink mobile -
and gives it to JOSIE LEO watches in horror Now he
understands

JOSIE takes the phone and disappears back into the seat
as they pass a sign for a service station

DUCK (CONTD)
You hungry I bet youre hungry

You must be hungry big guy like you
(getting bored of his passengers)

How about you Come on speak up

He laughs and gets out of the jeep

JOSIE turns to look at LEO He stares back at her his
lips trembling with effort but unable to respond

She pulls something out of her pocket and holds it out

It is the drawing of the two bears LEO gave to her in
the fast-food restaurant She has drawn another bear
into it standing a little way away from the others
She smiles and turns back round in the seat leaving the
paper and crayon tantalizingly within reach

LEO again tries to move He strains against his bonds
some strength returning but not nearly enough

in a great lung-full of air

through the windscreen

DUCK

(straining against LEOs weight)
Recognise this place I used to take

more exotic next to the water Cheap
bastard If he wanted exotic he should
have let the girls work up a tan and have
me shoot them in Bali Russians Zero

(waits)
Nothing huh

DUCK seems disappointed LEO still won’t talk

Now right out at the end of the pier DUCK lets go of
LEO and tries to get his breath back He is shattered

DUCK (CONTD)
Bigbig fella aint you

With a final burst of effort he manages to stand LEO
upright right next to a gate in the railings

DUCK (CONTD)
(totally exhausted)
Man I never in a million years wouldve
thought of Cactus Bill as the daddy type
all protective over Josie

He looks over the side at the waves lashing against the
stanchions then kicks open the gate and turns towards
LEO

DUCK (CONTD)
Naadirah should have never let him find
out he had a daughter shouldve just
took off with you Then we wouldnt all
be in this shit now would we

For a moment the full weight of this hits him the
magnitude of recent events And then in a flash its
rejected

talking

DUCK (CONT’D)

Still nothing from LEO DUCK gives up goes to grab
him

-and LEOS mouth starts moving
DUCK (CONTD)

Hey You see You can talk when you

LEO mouths something again

DUCK (CONTD)
What Whats that babe

DUCK leans in to hear better LEO’S arms silently lift
around the unaware DUCK

LEO
(a rasping of air)

and hands grasping lock together

DUCK
Hey Hey

Ever so slowly LEO starts to topple himself towards the
gate taking DUCK with him

DUCK (CONTD)
Get the fuck off me

LEO takes a huge breath just before they tumble through
the gap and plunge into the lake

CUT TO

They two of them sink into the murk DUCK struggles
against the bear hug but LEO is too strong for him

LEOS stare drills into DUCKS eyes - the last thing he
will ever see As DUCK loses consciousness LEO kicks
off against his limp body lungs burning trying to get
enough momentum to propel himself to the surface

Memories swim through his oxygen-starved brain RAJEEYAH
telling him that NAADIRAH loved him

The waves push him into the pier supports and he grabs

hold clinging as he trembles with the cold

JOSIE
Leo

JOSIES little face peers down at him from the railing
above

JOSIE (CONTD)
Are you okay

JOSIE gets on her hands and knees and gets as close to
the edge as she dares looking down on him in the water
below

LEO snaps out of his exhaustion He frantically motions
for her to get back signals that he will come up to
her

She leans precariously further over the edge to see him
We can hear a creak of one of the boards giving way

LEO grimaces his face contorting with an alien effort
LEO
No Josie no It’s dangerous Get
back
JOSIE immediately retreats

LEO pushes away from the pier support and swims towards
the shore
