Classic shot of the illuminated Golden Gate Bridge

SUPER CAPTION A FEW YEARS LATER

EXT STREET OUTSIDE MARKS NIGHT

It is about 400 am All is quiet We follow a mean-looking
alley cat to the front of a modest ground-floor apartment
It pauses then slinks round the side onto a ledge and in
through a partially-opened window
INT MARKS PLACE NIGHT

The cat comes through the window hops onto the floor and
quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has
been set out specially As it settles down to its meal we
become aware of a heavy and regular sound like a ships
pump coming from somewhere close-by

In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop
from a â€œ50s sci-fi movie A human head protrudes from one
end The object is an iron lung and its purpose is to keep
its occupant Mark OBrien breathing Every 45 seconds the
pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside forcing Marks chest
to expand and suck in air He is fast asleep

2A
MARK (VO)
Breathing
Look you
This most excellent canopy the
air

Presses down upon me

At 15 pounds per square inch

A dense heavy blue-glowing ocean
Teasing me with its nearness and
immensity

And all I get is a thin stream of
it

A fingers width of the rope that
ties me to life

Having now eaten its fill the cat has a good scratch then
wanders over to the iron lung

It hops up onto the small platform that supports Marks head
and slides itself along his face once this way once the
other way then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its
length Through the portholes we just make out the shape of
Marks bent undersize body Suddenly Marks nose twitches
He opens his eyes and grimaces

MARK
Shit

His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the
terrible itching He shakes his head violently then stops
suddenly and closes his eyes We hear his thoughts

MARK (VO) (CONTD)
Okay just focus Now scratch
with your mind okay your mind
scratch with your mind

After a couple more nose twitches he settles down It seems
to have worked In his peripheral vision Mark can see the
cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair one of the
only other pieces of furniture in the room The first hints
of dawn start to appear through the curtains They

illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging
on the wall Mark acknowledges it

MARK (CONTD)
Good morning

Sunlight streams in making the picture look truly sacred
EXT MARKS PLACE DAY

JOAN a solid but slovenly woman in her late 30s walks up to
Marks front door takes a key from her purse and lets
herself in

INT MARKS PLACE DAY

She comes in

JOAN
Good morning

Mark does not immediately acknowledge her

MARK
Youre late

A LITTLE LATER
The center of the iron lung basically a thin mattress has
been slid out and Joan is in the process of giving Mark a
bed bath He is frail and helpless

There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently
unfeeling woman exercises total control over him at least
temporarily

MARK (VO)
Joan
I swear this was one crazy bitch
Whod swing me about enough to
scare me
But careful enough so she could
say
Now what was all the yelling
about You polios are screamers
Always were
I didnt say a word but typed my
skinny novel in my head
And thought about revenge

In the course of washing his private parts Mark has an
involuntary erection Joan gives him a shriveling look He
feels belittled and humiliated

A LITTLE LATER

Mark is on his side his trousers are on and she is buttoning
up a bright red shirt It is an awkward business They do it
in silence avoiding eye contact as much as possible

EXT STREET OUTSIDE MARKS PLACE DAY

Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney similar but slightly
different from the one in the news clip There are no mirrors
and no motor just an oxygen tank a tube and a mouthpiece
just next to Marks mouth Most of him is covered with a
colorful blanket The whole thing is a sports-coupe version
of his iron lung

JOAN
Would you mind if I asked you a
favor

MARK

You need help moving furniture
She has no apparent sense of humor

JOAN
I need an advance on my pay like
two weeks Thats not a big ask is
it

Mark looks rightfully shocked
MARK
What if you dont last another two

weeks
4a

He gives her a look and means it We hear his thoughts

MARK (VO) (CONTD)
Joan never failed to put me ina
crappy mood It was also a drag
that I was no longer allowed to use
my other gurney the self-propelled
one It had caused a couple of
spectacular accidents

They turn a corner and approach a church

MARK (VO) (CONTD)
Basically in spite of all the
mirrors I couldnt see where I was
going

EXT CATHOLIC CHURCH DAY

Joan pushes Marks gurney into the sanctuary
INT CATHOLIC CHURCH DAY

FATHER BRENDAN is giving a sermon Mark listens with
satisfaction There are not many others there

FATHER BRENDAN
The Apostle Luke tells us that when
Elizabeth spoke to Mary the baby
in her womb leapt - For lo as
soon as the voice of thy salutation
sounded in mine ears the babe
leaped in my womb for joy So
Marys fear and apprehension slowly
gave way to pride and purpose
Elizabeth saw the greatness in
Mary Blessed art thou among
women Elizabeth pregnant herself
with St John felt the power of
this wondrous woman It was

Elizabeth and her absolute faith
that gave Mary the courage she was
lacking and she gave thanks

The expression on Marks face is that

There is an awkward short moment when

he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake
hands For no good reason he nods instead

No

FATHER BRENDAN

Hello Im Father Brendan I dont
think weve met

MARK

we havent Im Mark OBrien I
knew Father Seamus very well Im
sorry that hes not here any more

FATHER BRENDAN
As are many others Im going to do
my best to fill his shoes I
understand youd like me to hear
your confession

MARK
Yes I would By the way I enjoyed
Mass I liked your tone

Father Brendan is not sure how to take this

FATHER BRENDAN
Thank you

MARK
You dont believe absolute privacy
is an essential part of the
confessional do you

FATHER BRENDAN
No I do not I believe sincerity
is the most essential part

MARK
I told my attendant to come back in
half an hour Is that okay

FATHER BRENDAN
Yes take your time Im in no
rush

MARK
Did Father Seamus say anything to
you about me
FATHER BRENDAN
No one said anything to me about
you

MARK
I can be a bit time consuming but
Im worth the trouble

Father Brendan breaks a smile for the first time
FATHER BRENDAN
Im here for you Mark

Look this is not exactly a
confession I havent yet done the
deed I was hoping to sort of get a
quote in advance

Father Brendan sits down

FATHER BRENDAN
fell me whats on your mind

MARK
The most immediate thing on my mind
would be my attendant Joan Im
thinking of getting rid of her
ts an evil thought but I cant
help it

fq

FATHER BRENDAN
s she dishonest or incompetent

MARK
No neither of those She looks at
me the wrong way Its that you-
need-me-more-than-I-need-you look
Id like to show her shes wrong
just for the evil satisfaction it
will give me Is that a sin
Father

FATHER BRENDAN
Well it obviously troubles you

MARK
Yes it troubles me a lot Because
maybe its really a power trip Me
against her Me against the world

FATHER BRENDAN
I really wouldnt worry too much
about that The question is whether
you like having her around

MARK
I cant stand her

FATHER BRENDAN
Then get rid of her If I were ina
position to choose Id get someone
nice Even it was a power trip

MARK
Then I have your blessing to fire

her

FATHER BRENDAN
Unofficially yes

MARK
Thats good enough for me

FATHER BRENDAN
Please if ever you feel I can be
useful do let me know It was a
pleasure talking with you

MARK
Same here

INT MARKS PLACE DAY

We see a pencil eraser on the end of a stick slowly tapping
the keys on an electric typewriter At the other end of the
stick which is about a foot long is Mark manipulating it
adeptly with his mouth There is a white index card in the
typewriter on which he is typing a job notice We see the
first word POET

It is some time later Amanda is giving Mark a massage With
enormous satisfaction he feels her curvy parts moving around

Tugged by her athletic arms
From the everlasting gravity

another COUPLE They are playing Scrabble

MARK (VO)
She took me on a picnic once
With her boyfriend and another
couple Lust crackled in the air
between those twentyish people

Amanda is clearly paying more attention to Mark than to Matt

MARK (VO)
What did the boyfriend think
That I was in his way
Im always in somebodys way I
thought the sun in my eyes

We sense Marks deep satisfaction as he closes his eyes and

the sun warms his face

MARK (VO)
As she glided through crowds of
lives She couldnt leave me lying
there Dried out bubble gum stuck on
the underneath of existence

INT BATHROOM NIGHT
Amanda and her boyfriend MATT are sharing the tub

MATT

MARK
What does your boyfriend think of
me

AMANDA
Hes an asshole It doesnt matter
what he thinks of you

MARK
Im interested in the opinion of an
asshole
AMANDA

He thinks youre some kind of
Svengali and that youre going to
hypnotise me into your cult

MARK
Hes right

AMANDA
He says he can already see changes

She finishes shaving him and cleans him up His eyes feast on
every detail of her face

Cut to somewhere at night Amanda is giving Mark a pole
dancing demonstration complete with disco beat and mirror-
ball lighting

So with her gentle fearless heart
She took me in
I thrived in her garden
And wanted more

INT CLOTHING STORE DAY

Amanda is wheeling Mark in his gurney around the store
stopping from time to time to take something down from the
shelf She picks out a shirt

AMANDA
This you must have

As she leans over to show it to him Mark doesnt seem to be
listening He whispers to her

MARK
I love you

She says nothing and gives the faintest of smiles then puts
the shirt back They continue round the store in thoughtful
silence and avoid eye contact with each other We sense from
the looks on their faces that this moment spells the end of a
beautiful friendship

chapel

marry her thinking it might swing
things

FATHER BRENDAN
Did it

MARK
Yes She left

They sit in silence for a while Father Brendan seems to be
at something of a loss

FATHER BRENDAN
I wish I knew what to say I mean

heart And as I said Im here for
you I just wish I had something

After a moment of surprise

INT LAURAS OFFICE DAY

in with a jolt

Laura a well-dressed attractive woman in her late 30s sits
in a chair a few feet from Mark His gurney takes up most of

the available space in the room

LAURA

Did you ever discuss sex with your

parents

MARK

No That would have been

unthinkable

LAURA
Why

MARK

Thats the way they saw the world
It wasnt just that polite people

didnt think about sex No-one did

It was never discussed As far as
they were concerned there was
nothing down there

Laura listens She is pretty in a dark angular way A phone
on her desk rings
LAURA
Sorry about that

She walks over to it pushes a button then comes back She
has a noticeable limp

MARK
Whats that from

LAURA
Cerebral palsy

MARK
Youd hardly notice

LAURA
People notice Its not easy the
whole thing attracting a guy
dating sex all very problematic

MARK
I find that hard to believe in your
case
LAURA

Well you better believe it

MARK
So what sort of chance do you give
me
LAURA

Of achieving your romantic fantasy
Very small to minute

MARK
Look theres no need to pull any
punches You can be as direct as
you like with me

She smiles

LAURA
Mark Im just a humble sex
therapist I try to help people
with sex problems that can be
addressed Your problem I
understand is that you have never
had sex
Thats correct

LAURA
Would I be correct in assuming
youre unable to masturbate

MARK
Correct

LAURA
Has anyone done it for you

MARK
No
LAURA
Have you ever asked anyone

MARK

Not specifically I asked someone
to marry me She declined Does
that come close to masturbation

LAURA
You know being with the person you
love is not the only way of
expressing yourself sexually There
are people called sex surrogates

MARK
Oh

LAURA
Psychotherapists and psychiatrists
are not allowed to have sex with
their clients even if it seems
like a good idea Sex surrogates
dont have that limitation

MARK
Would this be covered by my medical
benefits

LAURA
Unfortunately no Youd have to
pay the full fee whatever that
was

MARK
So basically I would be paying
for sex
31A

31B

LAURA
Yes Mark you would be paying for
sex But the person you would be
paying is not a hooker She is a
highly trained and sensitive
professional who is not motivated
by money Just as Im not In fact
you can think of a surrogate as an
extension of me Do I seem like a
hooker to you

Mark thinks

OMITTED 31A

INT LAURAS OFFICE DAY 31B

Mark comes back to reality
MARK

What sort of cost would I be
looking at

LAURA
It depends how many sessions you
need

MARK
Say one just to try it and see if
I like it

LAURA
Im sorry it doesnt work that
way Its a process You have to be
patient with yourself There can be
quite a lot of talking involved

MARK
Ive set aside 500 Do you think
that would cover things

LAURA
Oh yes thats ample So what do
you think

Rod wheels Mark into the church
INT SIDE CHAPEL DAY

advice as a friend if you know
what I mean

Father Brendan sits down on the end of a pew next to Mark

FATHER BRENDAN
Sure and I understand what you
mean

MARK
Do you remember at one point you

long story I ended up seeing a
therapist a particular sort of
therapist a sex therapist

FATHER BRENDAN
Uh-huh

MARK
My penis speaks to me Father
Brendan Sometimes I ejaculate
during a bed bath in front of my
attendant

MARK (CONTD)
All I feel is shame and
mortification while other men
apparently get pleasure Im sorry
if I sound angry

FATHER BRENDAN
Dont worry about it Go on

Mark pauses to take a few breaths on his oxygen mouthpiece
then goes on

MARK
This therapist suggested I could
work with a sexual specialist have
sex with someone known as a sex
surrogate who would be sensitive
to my special needs Ive been
giving it some thought

Father Brendan interrupts him

FATHER BRENDAN
Hold on What do you mean have

sex

MARK
Well I dont really know how to
describe

FATHER BRENDAN
Sorry that wasnt what I mean
are we talking about sexual
intercourse

MARK
I think so

FATHER BRENDAN
Outside marriage

MARK
I did do my best on the question of
marriage

Father Brendan shakes his head with concern

FATHER BRENDAN
What is the difference between this
sexual specialist and a common
prostitute

MARK
I dont know but I think theres a
difference

23A

FATHER BRENDAN
How do you know shes not some
hooker gussied up as a social
worker whos just going to rob
you

MARK

about her

FATHER BRENDAN
How old are you

MARK
Thirty-eight

FATHER BRENDAN

date

FATHER BRENDAN

about Fornication

MARK
Your advice as a friend

FATHER BRENDAN
And do I have the casting vote so
to speak

MARK
Lets say I value your advice just
as much as I do the therapists

FATHER BRENDAN
Youre serious arent you

MARK
I think sex is a serious matter
Its one of the most persistent
themes in the bible

So is it possible for me to know a
woman in the biblical sense and

Vera eases Mark onto the bed positioning him so that he can
see the doorway As a finishing touch she dabs a little

cologne behind his ears

light blouse light skirt and her long hair is loose

Cheryl walks over to the dresser When her back is turned
Mark screws up his face in self-disgust She finds an

envelope

CHERYL
Thank you

She puts it in her bag Mark eyes her carefully

MARK
That was the wrong way to start
off

CHERYL

Yes it was Shall we start again

MARK
Please you start

She sits down on the bed and looks at him It is a very
frank stare She is trying to take a lot in

CHERYL
Although the aim is for us to have
She looks

sex Im not a prostitute and you
dont need to pay me up front Ive
nothing against prostitutes but
theres a difference We can talk
about that later

MARK
Im sorry

CHERYL
The other thing is there is a
limit to the number of sessions we
can have together Did Laura
mention that when you saw her

MARK
Im sorry I dont remember

CHERYL
The limit is six But that gives us
plenty of opportunity to explore
Now I understand you are able to
have an erection

MARK
Yes but not out of choice

CHERYL
Do you know how many men there are
on this planet who would give
anything for a natural erection

around the room

CHERYL (CONTD)
Is this your place

MARK
No its a friends The only
bedroom furniture I have at my
place is an iron lung Ive
sometimes thought about buying a
futon in case the need arose

CHERYL
Its worth thinking about

MARK
Ive got the space It can be
expensive though a nice futon I
mean how much do you think a good
one would cost

CHERYL
Mark just take a deep breath then
let go

MARK

Do I seem anxious

CHERYL
You do a little
Cheryl lies down beside him

CHERYL (CONTD)
Laura told me you were a poet
Whats it like to be a poet

MARK
Its a way of living inside your
own head which is where I spend
most of my time

CHERYL
But not today By the way I like
your shirt

He smiles genuinely flattered

MARK
Thank you

CHERYL
So I need to ask you some basic
questions Okay

MARK
Sure

CHERYL
What is the iron lung for

MARK
It keeps me breathing I can spend
a few hours outside of it with my
portable respirator depending on
how I feel But I work and sleep in
the iron lung
34A

CHERYL
How do you feel right now

MARK
Out of my league
CHERYL
I meant your breathing
MARK
Ohfine In fact better than
usual
CHERYL

Thats great Do you have any areas
of unusual sensitivity Any parts
of your body you dont want me to
touch

MARK
I have normal sensitivity all over
Its just that my muscles dont
work You can touch me anywhere

CHERYL
Shall we get undressed then

Mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it He
hesitates momentarily

MARK
Sure

Cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt Marks terror is visible
in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating She
starts to slowly extract one of Marks arms from his shirt-
sleeve Suddenly he lets out a piercing scream

MARK (CONTD)
Ow Ow Stop It hurts

She recoils shocked

CHERYL
Whats wrong

MARK
Holy Mother of God

CHERYL
Tell me whats wrong
MARK
My fingers Theyre caught

She discovers that his fingers have been snagged in the
fabric of the shirt and his fingers are being bent backward

CHERYL
Okay okay Ive got it Dont
worry

She carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off

MARK
Be careful please

CHERYL
Mark Im going to be really
careful with you I dont want to
hurt or injure you in any way but
its really not sexy when you yell
at me Okay

MARK
I wont yell at you any more

CHERYL
But youll tell me calmly the
moment anything starts to hurt
MARK
Yes
CHERYL
Now lets do the other arm

Little by little she extracts the other arm He grimaces his
way through it but more in fear than in pain She finally
sets his shirt down on the end of the bed

CHERYL (CONTD)
Nice shirt

MARK
You already said that

CHERYL
Did I I guess Ima little
anxious too

She undoes the top of his pants

CHERYL (CONTD)

herself together and is wrapped in a kimono which she has
brought herself

INT CARMENS PLACE DAY

Cheryl emerges from the bathroom and starts to undress

CHERYL

No
Cheryl continues undressing Mark looks away

CHERYL
Okay the difference between me and
a prostitute is that I dont want

help you communicate about your
sexual feelings so you can share
them with a future partner

She stands there for a few moments but he keeps his eyes
averted She turns back the sheets gets into bed beside him
and he finally looks at her

MARK
Whenever Im naked everyone else
in the room is usually dressed Now
that Im in bed with another naked
person Im very confused

She strokes his hair

CHERYL
So why is it confusing

MARK
Id always expected that God or my
parents would intervene to keep
this moment from happening

She slides her hand down She can feel his heart thumping
37A

CHERYL
Mark close your eyes and focus on
your sense of touch

He closes his eyes

CHERYL (CONTD)
Id like you to tell me how it
feels each time I touch a different
part of your body If something
feels good tell me If something
feels ticklish or bothers you let
me know I dont want you to
tolerate anything Im going to
start with the top of your head

She strokes his hair
CHERYL (CONTD)
You have soft hair Its nice to

the touch So you like it

MARK

She moves her fingers round behind his ear then the front of
his ear

MARK (CONTD)
That feels weird

CHERYL
Weird good Or weird bad

MARK
Just weird
She moves her hand down his neck

MARK (CONTD)
Good

His shoulder

CHERYL
Still good

MARK
Everything good so far except the
ear

She moves her fingers along his side very very lightly For
Mark so far this is the best
37B

MARK (CONTD)
Are these the body awareness
exercises

CHERYL
Youre clever to have worked that
out

Her hands massage their way down his torso Marks reactions
are a little like shock waves

MARK
People tell me Im very perceptive

CHERYL
Would you like to see what I feel
like

She carefully takes his hand and caresses the fingers around
one of her breasts then puts his hand back
Cheryls hands move further down his body

CHERYL (CONTD)
Are you wearing cologne

MARK
Yes

CHERYL
Mmm my favorite brand Okay Im

stomach and down to your pen

The expression on Marks face changes to one of shock then
agony then ecstasy

How do you feel

MARK
Cleansed and victorious

VERA
Doesnt get any better than that

MARK
Tell me about your first sexual
experience

VERA
Let me think It wasnt all that

think it would fit It was scary
But he was nice I guess he
couldnt help it
Was he Chinese

VERA
Are you kidding I only hung out
with white guys at high school

MARK
Why is that

Are they happy now youve got a
Chinese boyfriend

MARK
Why do you call it a dick instead
of a penis

INT CHERYLS PLACE NIGHT

Cheryl is at a tiny desk dictating into a recorder

CHERYL
First session Mark is the oldest
of four children and raised
Catholic He was extremely nervous
He yelled a lot when I took off his
shirt but I think more out of fear
than pain He cannot masturbate
Has only had the occasional kissing
experience He is capable of
achieving an erection easily but
the unusual curvature of his body
could be a serious obstacle to
intercourse

She puts the recorder away in a file drawer and locks the

drawer with a key which she keeps with her
INT CHERYLS BEDROOM NIGHT

Cheryl gets into bed beside her husband JOSH
apparently asleep

CHERYL
This gentleman I just started

incomprehensible She nudges him

CHERYL (CONTD)

INT SIDE CHAPEL DAY

Mark is in the little side chapel with Father Brendan

MARK
I dont know what I had envisaged
it would be like the first time I
mean But that wasnt the image I
had I thought there would be more
to it Not that it was unpleasant
After all I was in bed with a
naked woman She complimented me on
my shirt and my hair She held my
penis I havent even seen my penis
for over thirty years Anyway
onward Am I sharing too much

FATHER BRENDAN
No Im used to it

INT MARKS PLACE NIGHT

Mark is in his iron lung With his mouth stick he turns the
page of one of those anatomical instruction books on sex
There are the typical graphic cross-section diagrams of
penises entering vaginas Ravels Bolero plays quietly in
the background as he reads to himself

MARK
Sometimes the head of the penis
may be too large to penetrate the
vaginal opening smoothly in which
case the application of lubricant
is recommended to avoid
possible Oh my God

EXT STREET OUTSIDE MARKS PLACE DAY

This time Rod is wheeling Mark He seems only slightly less
anxious than the first time but still noticeably anxious

ROD
Whats on the menu today

MARK
Were attempting intercourse

ROD
Uh-huh Thats a big one

MARK
What do you think of it
Intercourse

ROD
Overrated but necessary Theres
plenty of other ways of achieving
the same result but somehow you
dont feel youve actually done it
till youve gone all the way in

This does not help Marks state of mind

Mark is in the side chapel with Father Brendan

MARK
I did it again This time I
ejaculated on her thigh

Father Brendan winces

MARK (CONTD)
I felt cursed that the whole
enterprise was cursed It seemed
like a totally just punishment God
wasnt actually denying my
sexuality He was merely pointing
out to me how useless it was

FATHER BRENDAN
Its amazing to me how often God is
brought into the sex act I
understand that even amongst non-
believers the most common
expression of sexual ecstasy is

Oh God

INT CARMENS PLACE DAY

Cheryl returns from the bathroom and slides back into bed

CHERYL
Okay I dont want to hear any more
about God cursing you I want the
credit It was my overpowering
beauty that did it It took you by

touching you and when we both

feel youre aroused then Im going
to guide you into my vagina

Is there anything I need to do

CHERYL
Close your eyes feel your body
thats all you need to do

Mark closes his eyes In his minds eye he sees the saintly
figures in the beautiful stained glass windows of the church
with the afternoon sun blazing through An equally saintly
but naked Amanda floats towards him her arms beckoning

When he opens his eyes Cheryl is straddling him but ina
Leaning Tower of Pisa sort of way It is a struggle for her
but somehow she is managing to get Mark into a workable
position for intercourse Suddenly he panics

MARK
It wont fit Its not going to
fit

CHERYL

No Mark it will fit just fine

MARK
No its dangerous Its too big

CHERYL
Its not too big Relax

MARK
It wont fit Itll hurt Its too
risky

INT CHERYLS PLACE NIGHT

Cheryl is at her desk dictating her notes

notepad with some jottings

CHERYL
Mark seemed to be at his most
relaxed when I sucked his penis At
the moment he is fixated on penis-
vagina and his anxiety is focused
around that The root of his
anxiety is his parents and his
religion He believes he doesnt
deserve sex He believes he is
responsible for his little sisters
death at the age of seven because
his mother was too busy looking
after him

MARK
Im sorry to lay all this on you
Father My worry now is that its

Cheryl or any other woman Maybe
intercourse would prove I was an
adult Maybe I dont want to cross
that line Maybe this was a bad
idea

FATHER BRENDAN
Do you want to know what I think

MARK
Please

animals a few times to get it
right Can I suggest you try and
enjoy it more Dont worry about

it between his lips After a few breaths he is relatively
relaxed She lies down beside him

That was before she died She was
kind of a sad little girl It
didnt do much good Im really
sorry that the last time I saw her
I fought with her I made her cry

Marks eyes begin to look teary

MARK (CONTD)
My parents could have left me in

found out the average life
expectancy for polios in nursing
homes was 18 months So they took
me home They gave me a life

Cheryl props herself up on one elbow

CHERYL

So for years I didnt believe

to Judaism

and now Im converting
MARK
I guess its good to have some kind
of insurance

CHERYL
I didnt think of that

MARK
Then why are you doing it

CHERYL

My husband asked me to do it before
his grandmother dies The idea is
if it makes her happy and him
happy then it will do the same for
me Our son is neutral on the
subject but theoretically if it
looks like it makes me happy itll
make him happy too Thats the way
my husbands family talks and
thinks The fact that Im happy
already doesnt seem to be
relevant

MARK
Whats your sons name

CHERYL
Tony Hes 14 years-old and very
smart Youd like him

Cheryl and Mark lie together in contented silence for a
while

MARK

Does he know what you do

lung staring at it

I wrote letters to Amanda in
Germany
Five six pages long
A year passed
Heard nothing
Was it my fault
Of course it was
But the guilt isnt enough to patch
over the rage

I pound the insides of my mind with
words such puny fists
And nobody hears

The poem ends and we hear instead a RADIO BROADCAST of a
Giants game Mark is engrossed Suddenly the broadcast
stops The digital read-out on the clock radio which says
1257 disappears A street light visible through the
window goes out The electric pump under Marks iron lung
whirrs to a halt We hear the sound of air escaping then an
eerie silence Even the cat is motionless

For a few moments Mark seems hypnotized Then he twists his
head and clamps onto his mouth stick He manoeuvres it over
to the speaker button on the phone and manages to press it in
the semi-darkness We hear a dial tone

At first he seems panicky but after a few moments he begins
to control his breathing and gradually psyches himself into a
strange calm

Yes it is Im converting

She takes off her robe and hands it to the Mikvah Lady who
does not fail to notice Cheryls body

Cheryl closes her eyes and thinks for a moment

CHERYL
I dont think youd understand

You can try me

CHERYL
Okay Im a housewife

MIKVAH LADY
Why shouldnt I understand

I guess I was mistaken

Cheryl steps towards the pool
MIKVAH LADY
I see youre very comfortable with
being naked

She takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water

CHERYL
That has never been one of my
problems

Sometimes new brides come with
their mothers Do I have to take
this off Can I please leave this
on Theyve never been naked
before No honey it all has to
come off

And it does

Cheryl takes another step into the water

MIKVAH LADY

of that pool without anything to
cling to but themselves Nothing to
hide behind This is your body
This is the body that God crafted
for you

Cheryl immerses herself up to her chest

under the water without touching
the walls or anything

Whoever looks after you will leave
the portable respirator switched on
at night fully charged so youll
have at least one back-up system

How close was I

SUSAN
To what

MARK
You know to that tunnel thing and
the light and the voice saying
dont go near the light

SUSAN
Is that what you remember

MARK
No I assume I passed out Before
that I remember feeling sorry for
myself

SUSAN
Do you feel relieved now

MARK
No I mean Im relieved that Rod
got to me in time but I still feel
sorry for myself

SUSAN
Im sure theres a cure for that
Would you like to talk to someone

MARK
I feel comfortable talking to you

SUSAN
Im only a volunteer not a
therapist I can refer you to
someone if you like

Mark breaks into a broad smile then a chuckle

MARK
Im sorry I dont mean to be rude
Im just smiling at the idea that a
therapist could do anything useful
for me right now My priest
couldnt

SUSAN
Are you religious

MARK
Yes I would find it absolutely
intolerable not to be able to blame
someone for all this Are you

SUSAN
No I dont go to any church and I
dont think about God very much
But I believe theres a mysterious
logic or poetry to life I guess
that makes me a spiritual type

MARK
Yes that would count

SUSAN
Would you like me to visit you

MARK
Are you married

SUSAN
No
MARK
Do you have a steady boyfriend

died She was the love of my life
We had the same priorities
baseball pretty much came first
and we wrote each other mushy
poems I never expected it nor did
she but thats often the way
things turn out

FATHER BRENDAN
That was quite something What do
you propose to do for an encore

MARK

secret But here I am back with
the living If there is another
place then I think they took one
look at me and decided to throw me
back

FATHER BRENDAN

FATHER BRENDAN

badly about her or about it

MARK
I no longer feel like that

Father Brendan is rather taken by surprise

FATHER BRENDAN

end youre glad that you did it

MARK
Yes I am In fact at this point
in time I feel very blessed

FATHER BRENDAN
Blessed

MARK
Yes blessed They put me on this
new anti-depressant and now I can
really see life from the cup half
full rather than cup half empty
point of view

Father Brendan looks truly amazed

MARK (CONTD)
It takes about six weeks to kick
in but when it does you can
really tell the difference

FATHER BRENDAN

came There is definitely a smile on his face

INT MARKS PLACE NIGHT

165 165
Mark also has a smile on his face as he lies awake

MARK (VO)
Actually I was on drugs I was
taking anti-depressants and they
were helping a bit At least I was
able to see the cup-of-life
metaphor as a useful tool Of
course the two halves were never
even Not in my case thats for
sure Look at all the years of
unendurable crap Ive had to put up
with That fills most of the cup
But in the little bit thats left
what do I have to show for myself
Journalism Poetry At the very
least three beautiful women who
all loved me and will all show up
at my funeral

Three Reasons to Live

fq

fq

The mundane

Â© God it was boring but I did it
got it out of the way

The transcendent

We had this agreement --

God gave me life for a while
gave Him gratitude for a while
and it worked out OK

The curious

You know how every day is
different

just wanted to see

what would happen next

INT CHURCH DAY

Father Brendan delivers a eulogy We see members of Marks
FAMILY all teary-eyed

FATHER BRENDAN (TO MARK)
Mark I know youre watching Im
sorry my friend but we have to do
this Just bear with me and I
think you might like it

FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)

(CONTD)
Ive been branching out lately
reading Native American stories
about the character of the
trickster Sometimes he shows up
as a coyote sometimes as a raven
but he always does the unexpected
The trickster breaks the rules
Mark OBrien whose life were
celebrating today was very much
the trickster -- anyone who knew
him knew that

(MORE)

FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)
Besides his irreverent humor and
alarming honesty he always did the
unexpected

In nearly every aspect of his life
Mark did the unexpected His was a
dynamic voice in a paralyzed body

a full life lived long after he
should have been dead He

graduated from college wrote and
published articles and poems and --
against all odds by his own
admission -- entered into the fully
human experience of physical love

In this way Mark lived from day to
day to day from breath to breath
to breath for 49 years He loved
and he was loved and in his quiet
voice he spoke loud truths

We see Rod Vera and Laura the therapist in various rows
Also Amanda holding a toddler in her arms and sitting next
to a tall boring-looking HUSBAND

FATHER BRENDAN (VO) (CONTD)
Susan Fernbach will now read one of
Marks favorite poems

SUSAN (V0O)
This is called Love Poem for No One
in Particular

We see SUSAN at the lectern reading from a book

SUSAN
Let me touch you with my words
For my hands lie limp as empty
gloves
Let my words stroke your hair
Slide down your back and tickle
your belly
For my hands light and free-flying
as bricks
Ignore my wishes and stubbornly
refuse to carry out my quietest
desires

We see Cheryl as deeply touched by the words as she was the

first time

SUSAN (VO) (CONTD)
Let my words enter your mind
bearing torches
Admit them willingly into your

being
So they may caress you gently
within

INT MARKS PLACE NIGHT

In the middle of the room moonlit is Marks iron lung
empty and majestic with the cat sitting on top As we move
around the eerie capsule we hear the sound of the French Can-
Can slowly fade up It continues over END CREDITS
