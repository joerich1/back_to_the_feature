Based on the novel by Rick Riordan
INT INDOOR SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

Wooden bleachers line the surrounding walls of the Olympic-
sized pool The room is empty MOONLIGHT shines through the
skylights reflecting off the water Nikes Jay-Z T-shirt
and an iTouch are piled at the pools edge CAMERA CRANES
INSIDE the water AT THE POOLS BOTTOM we find

PERCY JACKSON age 17 sitting with his legs crossed dressed
in cargo shorts His eyes are closed His long dirty
blonde hair floats around him His expression is peaceful

PERCY (VO)
Ever since I was a kid I liked being in
the water Its where I do my best
thinking Sometimes when I concentrate
I hear this distant voice like
somebody trying to guide me give me
direction Weird huh

Percy opens his eyes shoots to the surface fills his lungs
with air

PERCY (VO)
Probably just water on the brain

EXT YANCY ACADEMY - DAY

A large campus in upstate New York Old brick buildings are
scattered across several well-manicured acres Percy walks
alone across campus dressed like a Venice Beach surf rat
listening to an iPod His attitude is tough hard cool

PERCY (VO)
My name is Percy Jackson Until a few
months ago I was a student here at Yancy
Academy The kind of place where parents
send their troubled kids when no one
else will take them

A fight breaks out between a group of students Teachers run
to break it up Percy keeps on walking

INT YANCY CLASSROOM - LATER - DAY
A 52 year old grey haired bearded teacher in a wheelchair
MR BRUNNER lectures to a group of kids who would rather be
elsewhere Percy stares at his textbook
PERCY (VO)
My so-called troubles had impressive-

sounding names--â€”

Percy squints at the text The words MORPH into odd shapes
PERCY (VO)
--like dyslexia and attention deficit
disorder But I had a better name for
them boredom

INT PERCYS DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Percys roommate is asleep SNORING A pair of rusted
metallic FOREARM CRUTCHES lean against his roommates bed
Percy lies awake the walls around him covered with posters
of SURFERS riding EXTREME WAVES Tacked to the wall is a
photograph Percy and his mom in happier times

PERCY (VO)
I was also supposed to have some
displaced rage because my father
abandoned my mom before I was born
But quite honestly none of that really
mattered

Distant THUNDER roars Percy gets up looks out his window
STORM CLOUDS form in the sky obscure the moon

PERCY (VO)
because my real troubles were just
beginning

EXT METROPOLITAN MUSEUM - MANHATTAN - THE NEXT DAY - DAY

The sky above Manhattan is heavy with dark ominous clouds
A YANCY ACADEMY BUS is parked in front of the museum

INT METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATER

A spacious glass-domed room filled with ancient GREEK
ARTIFACTS rusted WEAPONS and ARTWORK In the center of the
room are imposing SCULPTURES of the TWELVE OLYMPIAN GODS
MR BRUNNER lectures from his wheelchair

MR BRUNNER
There are twelve Olympian Gods The
major three were brothers who went on
to rule the world Zeus became the King
of the gods and ruled the sky His
brother Poseidon ruled the sea And
their other brother Hades ruled the
underworld

A group of fairly disinterested high school SENIORS stand
around Mr Brunner Percy stands off to the side sweatshirt
pulled up to hide his ipod headphones GROVER Percys
roommate stands beside him Grover is overweight with
curly brown hair glasses a wispy goatee and a perpetual
expression of lust and mischief Using his cell phone
Grover snaps a photo of the Aphrodite statues breasts
Brunner notices Frowns Not amused
MR BRUNNER
Grover Please

Grover looks up Guilty Brunner extends his hand

MR BRUNNER
A little more respect for the Gods

Grover sighs hands over the cell phone Brunner looks at
the photos holds up the camera for the class to see The
kids chuckle at the image of Aphrodites breasts

MR BRUNNER
What does this tell us about Grover

CUTE GIRL
Hes a sex addict

MR BRUNNER
Possibly Grover may be a tad more
hormonally challenged than most
teenagers But he still shares a similar
weakness with all of us Lust

GROVER
(leans to cute girl)
I knew we had something in common

MR BRUNNER
Its something the Greek Gods also shared
with us There were several occasions
when the Gods would come down to earth
and how shall I put this

GROVER
Hook up

MR BRUNNER
They would hook up with mortals

Several kids snicker

MR BRUNNER
The children of these unions were half-
God and half-human Can anyone tell me
what they were called

Mr Brunner scans to DREW BOBOFIT a tough angry mean
spirited bully with a buzzcut and tattoos

MR BRUNNER
Mr Bobofit

DREW
Bastards Mongrels Mutts

Drews two friends two hoodlums named TONY and VINCE laugh
Brunner scowls looks around

MR BRUNNER
Anyone else Percy

But Percy doesnt hear lost in his music Grover uses one
of his crutches to yank the headset out of Percys ear

PERCY
Huh What

MR BRUNNER
What is the proper name for the offspring
of a human and a God

Percy narrows his eyes thinks finally it comes to him

PERCY
Demigods

MR BRUNNER
Very good Mr Jackson
(to Drew Bobofit)
Mr Bobofit you and the rest of the
class obviously need a bit more incentive
to learn this material Perhaps a quiz
will help Tomorrow Chapters 7 and 8

INT MUSEUM MENS ROOM - LATER - DAY

Percy and Grover enter Grover using his crutches walks
with a pronounced limp

PERCY
I cant get above a D in most classes
But somehow without even studying
I get this stuff

GROVER
(ironic smile)
Maybe its in your blood

The bathroom door FLIES OPEN Drew and his friends enter
shove past Grover nearly knocking him down

DREW
Out of the way Crip

PERCY
Shut your mouth Drew

Drew turns walks back to Percy getting in his face
DREW
Youre the one who should keep your mouth
shut Jackson If you werent so busy
kissing Brunners ass we wouldnt be
having a quiz tomorrow

PERCY
Big deal You have to study Grow up

DREW
Not all of us can get a fancy tutor by
pretending we have dyslexia

PERCY
Im not pretending I mix things up
Like right now I could swear your dick
is where your head is supposed to be

Furious Drew and his gang DRAG Percy him into a STALL Drew
tries to SHOVE Percys head into the toilet bowl Percy
STRUGGLES to break free Grover BANGS on the stall door

GROVER (0OS)
Percy

As Percys face gets closer to the toilet water the water
begins to CHURN and BUBBLE growing in POWER

PERCY
Stop

Drew keeps PUSHING The water CHURNS violently

PERCY
I said STOP

Suddenly a BLAST OF WATER EXPLODES out of the toilet bowl

The water moves with EXTREME FORCE and a definite PURPOSE
It SHOOTS past Percy STRIKES Drew and the boys with the
power of a FIREHOUSE blows them out of the stall and

--ACROSS the bathroom floor right past Grover They land
UNDER the urinals Grover SEES Percy step out of the stall
Percy is SHAKEN CONFUSED UNSURE what just happened

GROVER
Percy Lets go

Drew and the boys get back on their feet SOAKED They BLOCK
Percy and Grovers exit

A CREAKING SOUND fills the room Followed by a low GROANING
NOISE and the sound of pipes RATTLING

Then -- CRACK CRACK -- several HAIRLINE FRACTURES form in
the walls and on the floor spreading out like spiderwebs

Urinals and sinks EXPLODE firing like missiles across the
bathroom Water RUSHES in through the holes in the wall
forming into the shape of several snake-like TENTACLES

The water-tentacles WHIP through the room like living
creatures They ATTACK Drew and his friends

Grover watches in AMAZEMENT Percy is BAFFLED standing in
the center of the maelstrom

The floor beneath Drews feet CRACKS OPEN A GEYSER of water
shoots upward The Powerful water LIFTS Drew into the air

The bathroom door FLIES OPEN MR BRUNNER rolls in STUNNED
by what he sees

The Geyser quickly DISSOLVES Drew FALLS to the floor right
on top of his soggy freaked-out friends The other water
STOPS FLOWING retreating back into the pipes leaving POOLS
OF WATER everywhere

MR BRUNNER
Whats going on

DREW
Jackson He blew up the bathroom

Mr Brunner looks very CONCERNED Percys expression is
equal parts amazement confusion and fear

PERCY
I didnt I dont it just--

Mr Brunner nods speaks softly almost knowingly

MR BRUNNER
--happened

INT MR BRUNNERS OFFICE - LATER - DAY

Angry Percy is sitting across from Mr Brunners desk
Grover stands in the background

PERCY
Detention But it wasnt my fault I
dont even know how it happened

MR BRUNNER
I believe you Percy But Dean Campbell
wants to suspend you I argued for a
compromise
PERCY
One month detention is a compromise

MR BRUNNER
For you Yes Youve been to six
different schools in eight years Youve
got a D-minus average Youre on very
thin ice

PERCY
Perfect I like cold water

MR BRUNNER
You really want to be expelled from
another school

PERCY
Do I really give a damn

MR BRUNNER

Maybe you dont But your Mother does
(soft solemn)

Dont let her down again

The words sting Percy looks out the window Troubled
upset Mr Brunner feels Percys torment Mr Brunner takes
a THICK BOOK off his shelf

MR BRUNNER
I want you to read this

PERCY
You know that I cant--

MR BRUNNER
Try

Mr Brunner places the book in front of Percy The writing
on the cover is in GREEK Percy refuses to look at it

INT LIBRARY - LATER - NIGHT

Outside THUNDER rumbles We are inside a dark ancient
library with high vaulted ceilings and lead glass windows
Rows and rows of towering bookshelves stand along the walls
each with its own ladder-on-wheels

Percy sits at a long wooden table in the middle of the room
He is alone save for the LIBRARIAN a small elderly woman
Percy is trying to read Mr Brunners book staring at the
GREEK LETTERS on the cover He squints

The Greek letters MORPH INTO ENGLISH LETTERS They read A
GUIDE TO GREEK MYTHS AND LEGENDS Percy is surprised pulls
the book close and reads to himself
PERCY
The Father of the Olympians was Kronos
He was the King of the Titans-
(pauses a small smile)
I can read

There is a LOUD CRASH The sound of BREAKING GLASS

Percy LOOKS UP and sees

A CREATURE hidden in the SHADOWS LEAPS through the window
The creature LANDS on the floor and slowly RISES UP Its
over TWELVE FEET TALL

The librarian SCREAMS The creature PULLS BACK its arm
SWIPES at the librarian with tremendous force

The librarian is KNOCKED OFF her feet FLIES through the air
and SLAMS into the wall OUT COLD

Percy STANDS TERRIFIED He starts to BACK AWAY

The creature TURNS faces Percy and STEPS FORWARD INTO the
light

It is the MINOTAUR
HALF MAN HALF BULL MUSCULAR with a long snout cruel
yellow eyes and battered razor-sharp horns Seeing Percy

the Minotaur ROARS then SPEAKS in an inhuman VOICE

MINOTAUR
Where is it

Percy turns and SPRINTS toward the door

The Minotaur RACES after him Faster than Percy the
Minotaur is UPON HIM in seconds

The Minotaur GRABS Percy LIFTS him into the air and HURLS
him at a bookshelf Percy SLAMS into the shelves FALLS to
the floor buried under a PILE OF BOOKS

Percy is STUNNED The wind knocked out of him The Minotaur
RUNS FORWARD lifts its arm about to PUMMEL Percy

Percy ROLLS OUT of the way The Minotaurs arm JUST MISSES
Percy and SMASHES a hole in the library floor

Percy gets to his feet DASHES around the corner The
Minotaur FOLLOWS Percy KICKS one of the wooden ladders into
the path of the creature

The Minotaur SLAMS through the ladder as if it were balsa
wood Percy heads for the LIBRARY DOORS

The Minotaur RUNS up SWINGS its razor sharp claw across
Percys back The claws RIP through his jacket Percy CRIES
OUT in pain falls to his knees The Minotaur MOVES IN FOR
THE KILL

The library doors BURST OPEN The Minotaur STOPS TURNS to
the sound

MR BRUNNER
Percy

Mr Brunner races into the room on his wheelchair holding a
simple BALL POINT PEN

MR BRUNNER
Use this

Mr Brunner THROWS the pen to Percy Confused Percy CATCHES
the pen Brunner SHOUTS

MR BRUNNER
Click it

PERCY
What

MR BRUNNER
Click it The pen is mightier than
the sword

Percy CLICKS the pen IT TRANSFORMS INTO A LARGE SHARP METAL
SWORD Percy stares at the blade in DISBELIEF

The Minotaur TURNS BACK to Percy who is on his feet
wielding the heavy sword

Percy LUNGES FORWARD and SWINGS The tip of the sword SLICES
DEEP ACROSS the creatures arm

The Minotaur CRIES OUT BLOOD seeps from its wound This
only makes the creature ANGRIER The Minotaur CHARGES Percy

Percy SWINGS again this time SLICING DEEP into the
Minotaurs TORSO

The Minotaur HOWLS in pain holding his bleeding CHEST WOUND
With a final GROWL the Minotaur TURNS and LEAPS OUT of the
library window

Percy looks around the room a gigantic mess of DESTROYED
books furniture and bookcases Percy glances to the sword
It CHANGES BACK into a common everyday ballpoint pen

PERCY
What was that thing

MR BRUNNER
We have to go Its coming back for you

PERCY
Coming back It was hurt--

MR BRUNNER
You temporarily scared it off A
Minotaur can only be killed by severing
the horn from its body

Brunner EXITS followed by a confused Percy

They were A long time ago But the
Gods tend to follow the heart of the
West Theyve been settled in America

he ever did

He looks at Grover then trails his eyes from Grovers face
down to his lower half which is completely VISIBLE now furry
arched legs goat butt hooves and all

GROVER
Actually I prefer Satyr
(a beat)
Oh And this is yours

He hands Percy the Minotaur HORN Percy stares at it His
expression darkens REALIZATION sets in

PERCY
It was real All of it was real

GROVER
(ashamed heartbroken)
Im sorry Percy Its my fault I
blew it It was my job to protect you
Both of you

Percy stares at the horn His expression is sad filled with
despair He speaks softly in grief TEARS fill his eyes

PERCY
My Mom Shes really gone

INT INFIRMARY â€”- LATER â€”- DAY

Percy is dressed depressed walking with Grover down the
aisle past the beds past the MOANING BATTERED KIDS Percy
looks at all of the wounded kids

PERCY
Where are we

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as they step out of the Infirmary and
stand at the top of a hill looking out over

GROVER
Camp Half Blood

The camp is spread across several acres of a beautiful lush
landscape surrounded by a pine forest The buildings
architecture is straight out of ancient Greece Constructed
of stone and marble with weathered well-worn facades A
small COLISEUM is visible in the distance

GROVER
Created by the Olympians for their
offspring Demigods Kids like you

Percy stands in awe Speechless
EXT CAMP HALF-BLOOD - LATER

Percy and Grover walk through the camp Hundreds of kids
aged 11 to 21 dressed in modern clothing are everywhere

They walk past several kids sitting inside a small outdoor
amphitheater as an OLD BLIND POET recites Homers Odyssey

GROVER
This is where you guys learn to harness
your powers to become leaders
warriors artists and heroes

PERCY
(incredulous )
You got the wrong guy Im no hero
Im a screw-up with dyslexia ADHD

GROVER
Those are your greatest gifts

PERCY
You call those gifts

They pass other kids FIRING ARROWS in an ARCHERY RANGE
throwing JAVELINS forging WEAPONS in a Blacksmith furnace
making VASES at a potters wheel

GROVER
When you try to read the letters seem
to float off the page right Thats
because your brains hard-wired for
ancient Greek Not English I bet
you had no trouble reading the book
Mr Brunner gave you in detention

PERCY
That was Greek

GROVER

(nods )
And your ADHD Youre impulsive you
cant sit still Those are your natural
battle reflexes They kept you alive
when you fought the Minotaur No mortal
screw-up could defeat the Minotaur
Percy Your blood is special Its

(somber )
The blood of a God

PERCY
And these kids Theyre all sons
and daughters of gods

GROVER
And goddesses

They pause at a practice BATTLEFIELD Annabeth SWORDFIGHTS
beating several stronger male opponents Percy WATCHES
very ATTRACTED to her

PERCY
Whats her name

GROVER
Smokin huh

PERCY
Her name

GROVER

Annabeth Daughter of Athena Goddess
of Wisdom

PERCY
I thought Athena was a virgin goddess

GROVER
She was But you try holding out for
10000 years I barely make it through
health class

Percy and Grover walk to the edge of the coliseum A HORSE
RACE is in progress EIGHT HORSES circle the track ina
CLOUD OF DUST They are SILHOUETTED against the bright rays
of the afternoon sun

As the horses reach the finish the dust clears Percys
mouth drops when he sees that they are CENTAURS HALF-MAN
HALF-HORSE One of the Centaurs walks away TROTS toward
Percy As the Centaur gets closer Percy RECOGNIZES him

PERCY
Mr Brunner

MR BRUNNERCHIRON
Here Im known as Chiron Nice to see
you up and around

PERCY
Youre youre

CHIRON
A real horses ass I know Im sorry I
had to keep my true form hidden from you
but it was for your own good I hope
youll forgive me

PERCY
What happened to your wheelchair

CHIRON
Only when Im in mortal form I could
never walk on only two legs

He leads Percy and Grover away They WALK through the camp
with Chiron

PERCY
Is this your camp

CHIRON
No Im just an overseer and a trainer

Chiron enters an ALCOVE nestled in the woods by the lake
Eleven distinct frat-like houses are arranged around a
common area dotted with old STATUES and ancient FOUNTAINS

CHIRON
This is where youll be staying

GROVER
Greek Row

The first house they pass has several SMOKESTACKS belching
BLACK SMOKE Outside a few kids covered in sweat and grime
work billows and anvils

CHIRON
The heirs of Hephaestus smith and weapon-
maker of the Gods

Chiron and Percy continue on past a BUILDING that resembles
a FORTRESS BARBED-WIRE fencing surrounds the lawn ANGRY
MUSIC BLASTS from within A dozen BIG UGLY MEAN KIDS are
YELLING at each other some are physically fighting

CHIRON
The offspring of Ares God of War

The next home is filled with dozens of HYPER ENERGETIC KIDS
running through the lawn playing pranks laughing They all
have sharp noses upturned eyebrows and mischievous smiles

CHIRON
Those pranksters are the offspring of
Hermes messenger of the gods

One of Hermes SONS motions to a nearby BROTHER clearly up
to something Hes watching the sorority house next door
It is decorated with romantic statues and gardens the most
lush home on Greek row The GIRLS who live here are drop
dead gorgeous most of them outside SUNBATHING

Grover stops dead in his tracks frozen like hes fighting an
urge and desperately losing

GROVER
Daughters of Aphrodite goddess of love
and other four letter words

SPRINKLERS go off drenching the girls They SCREAM run
inside Hermes sons roll on the ground laughing

GROVER
Ill catch up with you guys later

Grover makes a MAD DASH toward the drenched daughters of
Aphrodite CHASING them around the grounds

CHIRON
Satyrs You can never completely train
them to stop chasing the nymphs

Chiron and Percy round the U and stop at one of the largest
homes in Greek Row The home looks as if it were made of
CORAL A LARGE FOUNTAIN is in front Chiron turns to Percy

CHIRON
Welcome home

Percy is taken aback yet INTRIGUED

CHIRON
Your Father built this For you

PERCY
My Father

Chiron lifts his front legs and KICKS OPEN the doors

CHIRON
Poseidon

INT POSEIDONS PALACE - SAME

Percy and Chiron enter Poseidons home Most of the interior
is taken up by a large INDOOR POOL The stairways are lined
with cascading waterfalls There are many statues of HORSES
And a wall filled with various ancient rusted METAL
TRIDENTS Percy stares in AWE

CHIRON
Your father is God of the Seas as well
as horses and earthquakes It was his
wish that you lead a normal life He
asked me to watch over you and when you
got older I chose Grover to be your
protector

Percy looks at the collection of rusted TRIDENTS grabs one

PERCY
Why didnt my mom ever tell me

CHIRON
She couldnt It was for your own
safety There hasnt been a Demi-God
born of the Big Three in over a hundred
years

PERCY
The big three Zeus Hades and
Poseidon

CHIRON
(nods )
That makes you special powerful a
threat Thats why your Mom married your
step-father His rather pungent odor
masked the smell of your blood in case
you were ever in danger

PERCY
Like the Minotaur
CHIRON

Exactly

PERCY

So Gabes ass saved mine

CHIRON

I wouldnt put it that way but yes

PERCY

But why am I in danger Why are things
chasing me trying to kill me

CHIRON

Actually For the time being They
prefer that you stay alive

Why

PERCY

CHIRON

They think youve stolen something
valuable

PERCY

But I didnt steal anything

CHIRON

I believe you Not many others do Zeus
has convinced almost everyone that
youre

(a beat)
The Lightning Thief

Percy is confused Chiron points to the palace ceiling
Here is a stunning THREE DIMENSIONAL PAINTING depicting the
history of the Gods It makes the Sistine Chapel look
pedestrian Chiron points to a powerful image of Zeus
riding in the clouds the powerful MASTER BOLT in hand

Zeus

CHIRON
Master bolt The bolt where all

lightning originates The most powerful
weapon ever created harnessing more
power than several hydrogen bombs It
was stolen four days ago

PERCY

Why do they think it was me

Chiron points to an image of Zeus in combat against Poseidon

CHIRON

When the bolt disappeared Zeus naturally
blamed your father Theyve been in a
power struggle for centuries

(MORE )
CHIRON (CONTD)
But ancient law forbids Gods to cross
into each others realm Only a Demi-God
is capable of that Someone like you
Zeus closest relative

PERCY
But Ive never even met my Father
And I sure as hell wouldnt do his
dirty work

CHIRON
Unless the bolt is returned by midnight
of the summer solstice two weeks from
now there will be a war of the gods

PERCY
(mocking)
Zeus vs Poseidon Two gods enter the
ring only one will leave

CHIRON
War between the Gods is a serious matter
Percy Olympians will be forced to
choose sides Nature will turn against
itself Modern civilization will be
destroyed

PERCY
(pause concerned)
So what do we do
CHIRON
For the next few days we stay here
Until Zeus calms down Then we go to
Olympus where youll convince Zeus
of your innocence
Percy nods

Percy climbs out of the water

PERCY
Training for what

GROVER
This isnt celebrity rehab There

Big Scary Things

EXT CAMP HALF-BLOOD - BATTLEFIELD - LATER

The sky is GRAY OMINOUS There are several WEATHERED TENTS
scattered around the grounds the type of tents used on the
ancient battlefields of Rome and Greece Dozens of kids all
in armor SHARPEN their swords practice battle moves

Percy walks onto the battlefield wearing ARMOR holding a
heavy shield and sword He looks extremely uncomfortable and
awkward in it Grover is beside him

PERCY
How do you move in all this stuff

GROVER
You get used to it Or you get killed

Percy gives a nervous laugh Grover is dead serious When
the other kids see Percy they all stop and stare whisper to
each other Is that him The Lightning Thief Son of
Poseidon Slayed the Minotaur

Percy notices Annabeth wearing a RED PLUME surrounded by her
team all wearing Red Plumes Annabeth uses her sword point
to draw a game plan in the dirt CHIRON trots up

CHIRON
Heroes Warriors Fall in

The young warriors line up in FORMATION by teams RED PLUMES
on one side BLUE PLUMES on the other Annabeth is CAPTAIN
of the Red soldiers

CHIRON
Today we have some new blood in
our midst Percy Step forward

Percy pauses then STEPS FORWARD The kids crane their necks
to get a good look at Percy FASCINATED by him Percy smiles
an Annabeth but she just stares at him stoically

CHIRON
This is Percy Jackson Hes going to
need a team

LUKE a small energetic impish kid with a thin sloping nose
and a mischievous smile steps forward Luke is CAPTAIN of
the Blue soldiers He holds an ancient BRONZE SHIELD with
SEVERAL WARRIORS carved into the surface

LUKE
Well take him

Luke hands Percy a blue plumed helmet

LUKE
Im Luke Son of Hermes

Percy takes his helmet and BUZZZ Percy gets a a HUGE
ELECTRICAL SHOCK from the helmet SPARKS FLY Percy jumps
back drops the helmet Luke turns to his teammates

LUKE
I dunno Maybe it isnt so safe to
have a lightning thief on our team

Everyone is staring at Percy Suddenly they all break up
LAUGHING Luke picks up Percys helmet removes an
electrical JOY BUZZER from inside Luke grins at Percy

LUKE
Sorry Just bustin your balls
Couldnt resist My old mans God
of the Pranksters Its in the blood

Percy forces a smile nods takes the blue helmet from Luke

CHIRON
You all know the rules First team to
capture the enemy flag wins Assume your
last positions and remember We fight
to build each other up not to tear each
other down Use your skills on the
battlefield but save your true anger for
the dark forces

The Red soldiers start MARCHING OFF into the forest Percy
turns to Chiron NERVOUS

PERCY
I thought this was a game I dont
know how to use this stuff

CHIRON
You defeated the Minotaur

PERCY
But I had that cool flic-a-bic-sword

CHIRON
That would give you an unfair advantage
over the red team Just relax
Demigods all have some degree of
inherited skill Hercules was only a
level three when I began teaching him

PERCY
You taught Hercules

LUKE
Chiron trained all the great Demigods
Hercules Alexander the Great Bruce Lee
Michael Jordan turned them all into
heroes

CHIRON
They turned themselves into heroes I
only trained them
(confident)
Just do what comes naturally Percy
Youll be fine

LUKE

blue team RUN OFF Annabeth removes a BOW pulls ARROWS from
a quiver and FIRES a barrage at the fleeing blue soldiers

The arrows PIN kids to trees safely by piercing through

TOWARD the flag

Percy STEPS OUT of the water walks TOWARD the red flag He
REACHES forward about to PICK IT UP

A DOZEN RED SOLDIERS DROP from the trees They SURROUND

ANNABETH
My mother is the Goddess of Wisdom and
Battle Strategy You know what that

The Red Soldiers ATTACK Percy Percy is able to DEFLECT
nearly half the blows But they soon OVERCOME him He is
HIT SEVERAL TIMES

Percy FALLS to his knees He is BLOODIED BEATEN
EXHAUSTED Annabeth steps forward looks down at him

ANNABETH
You actually claim to be the Son of
Poseidon and the slayer of the Minotaur

The other Red soldiers BACK AWAY give Annabeth her space

ANNABETH
Stand up Fight

Percy slowly GETS TO HIS FEET Annabeth EXTENDS her sword
ARMED and READY Percy EXTENDS his sword

ANNABETH
Lets see what youre really made of

Their EYES MEET displaying a shared sense of intense
EXCITEMENT and ATTRACTION They begin a HEATED SWORDFIGHT
Percy LUNGES Annabeth SLASHES his arm Percy tries to
defend against Annabeths ASSAULT Hes NO MATCH for her
Annabeth is more ADVANCED more EXPERIENCED

Several RED and BLUE SOLDIERS gather on opposite sides of the
creek WATCHING the fight Luke Grover and Chiron ARRIVE

GROVER
Should we stop it

CHIRON
Not yet

Annabeth SLASHES Percy at every opportunity Percys arms
and legs have deep CUTS on them Theres a WOUND above his
right eye He is WEAK can barely hold his sword up
Annabeth is starting to SYMPATHIZE with him

ANNABETH

Percy shakes his head NO WAY He attacks SLOWLY
EXHAUSTED His swings are LABORED Annabeth easily DEFLECTS
the blows

Annabeth RAISES her sword flips it in the air grabs it by
the blade and SWINGS IT at Percys head CRACK Percys
helmet FLIES OFF his head He FALLS down into the shallow
waters at the CREEKS EDGE Almost UNCONSCIOUS

The red soldiers RAISE their swords in the air and chant
ATHENA ATHENA ATHENA

They CONGRATULATE Annabeth but she doesnt look happy She
watches Percy feeling REMORSEFUL

Percys bloody battered body LIES A FEW FEET FROM THE
RIVERS EDGE Blood DRIPS from his mouth A DISTANT MALE
VOICE echoes in his head

VOICE (VO)
Go to the water Percy The water

Percy uses his last bit of strength CRAWLING toward the
water He COLLAPSES His FINGERTIPS TOUCH THE WATER

Suddenly WATER from the creek SLITHERS up Percys hand and
arm moving around Percys body The water CRAWLS up Percys
skin and COVERS HIM in a thin wet veneer

Percys wounds INSTANTLY HEAL

Percys EYES OPEN His muscles TIGHTEN His hand moves and
GRABS the handle of his sword He slowly RISES to his feet
Behind him the water in the creek SHOOTS UP into the air

All of the kids stare in AWE Annabeth turns to see what is
happening She is struck SPEECHLESS by the sight of Percy
dripping wet standing in front of a GIANT WATER TRIDENT

SIX RED SOLDIERS rush forward to ATTACK Fighting like an
expert soldier Percy quickly and effortlessly TAKES THEM
DOWN one by one

Then Annabeth CHARGES Percy Their blades CLASH Its a
hard fought INTENSE DUEL

Percy skillfully KNOCKS the sword out of Annabeths hand and
sends her FALLING to the ground He stands over Annabeth
staring confidently down into her eyes The tip of his sword
is POINTED at her HEART

PERCY
You drool when youre impressed Wipe
your mouth

Annabeth wipes her mouth and then exchanges a slow smile
with Percy He RAISES his sword high in the air

PERCY

Kids start chanting POSEIDON POSEIDON but it soon turns
to PERCY PERCY PERCY

ease with the attention Two APHRODITE GIRLS smile at Percy
oozing sex appeal

APHRODITE GIRL ONE
I love a man who can handle a sword

Nearby Annabeth is talking to a few kids She glances over
SEES the girls fawning over Percy A flicker of jealousy
registers on Annabeths face The Aphrodite Girls turn to
exit each giving Percy a kiss to the cheek Grover nearly
faints Annabeth walks up to Percy

ANNABETH
Feeling like a hero

PERCY
More like a mutant Im not gonna grow
a fish tail or gills or anything like
that

ANNABETH
Not likely Although a huge ego isnt
out of the question

Annabeth fills a goblet with golden Ambrosia Percy is
attracted to her yet cautious suspicious

PERCY
You know you almost killed me out
there I couldve died If I was
normal

ANNABETH
But you arent Besides I always
knew

PERCY
How

She hands him the goblet of Ambrosia

ANNABETH
You drank the Ambrosia Theres a reason
its called food of the gods Ifa
pure mortal drank Ambrosia it would kill
them Your blood would have boiled and
your bones turned to dust

PERCY
But you didnt know that when you gave
it to me

ANNABETH

Womens intuition

PERCY
Intuition You bet my life on intuition

She shrugs smiles takes a long drink of Ambrosia Percy
NARROWS his eyes looking at her

PERCY
I get the sense that you dont like
me very much

ANNABETH
Its possible I mean Our parents
hate each other

PERCY
They do

ANNABETH
(nods )
And I definitely have strong feelings
for you I just havent decided if
theyre positive or negative

red eyes They PANIC RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES

GROVER

ANNABETH
I dont know The camps under a veil
of protection against underworld
forces Someone must have lifted it

THREE HELLHOUNDS charge into the camp They are DEMONIC
BEASTS hounds the size of buffalo Lava-red eyes fangs
like daggers Chiron runs up SHOVES Percy out of the way
just as one of the HOUNDS charges right at him

CHIRON

Chiron removes his PEN flicks it The pen TRANSFORMS INTO
THE SWORD Centaurs and kids SPRING INTO ACTION They grab
THEIR SWORDS BOWS AND ARROWS and prepare to FIGHT Percy
GRABS a sword

GROVER

The Hellhounds are RUTHLESS They DRAG one kid away another

beasts but it DOESNT PHASE the creature

The three Hellhounds CIRCLE BACK seeking out Percy They
see him and CHARGE AT PERCY Chiron LEAPS into the

Hellhounds path and STABS ONE with his sword It FALLS to

THREE OTHER CENTAURS surround another Hellhound It CHARGES
right through them Chiron HURLS the sword It IMPALES the

They are on a COLLISION COURSE At the last second before
impact Percy DROPS and SLIDES UNDER under the beast raising
his sword It SLASHES along the beasts underside The
hellhound is mortally WOUNDED

Percy stands looks down at the DYING beast Grover and
Annabeth JOIN Percy The beast lifts its head looks at

HELLHOUND

HELLHOUND
Liar If you want your Mother back

HELLHOUND

wounded Percy RUNS to Chiron Grover and Annabeth FOLLOW

INT CHIRONS STABLEHOME - LATER

Filled with books weapons and alchemical devices Chiron
is sitting as Annabeth BANDAGES his leg wound Grover and
Percy are watching but Percys mind is miles away Hes
flicking the pen-sword on and off Chiron looks at Percy

CHIRON
That sword has a name

Percy reads the GREEK name ENGRAVED along the swords handle

PERCY
Anaklusmos

CHIRON
In English it means Riptide I want
you to keep it

PERCY
Really
CHIRON
Youll be needing it more than me Its
made of celestial bronze and lethal to
any creature from the underworld

GROVER
Hades never sent his creatures into our
camp before

CHIRON
With Olympus in turmoil he will only get
bolder And as long as he thinks Percy
has the bolt hell stop at nothing

Percy stands walks to Chiron looks at him Very solemn

PERCY
Chiron The hellhound It spoke
to me told me that

(swallows back emotion)
My Mom is alive

CHIRON
What

PERCY
She was abducted by Hades Is that
possible

CHIRON
(nods )
Hades has been known to abduct the
living Like Persephone His wife

PERCY
The hellhound said that I can get her
back in return for the bolt

CHIRON
But you dont have the bolt

PERCY
I know But you said I could convince
Zeus that Im not the thief Cant I

do the same with Hades When he realizes
I dont have the bolt hell give me my
Mother back

CHIRON
It isnt that simple

PERCY
Why not

CHIRON

Zeus and Hades are very different Zeus
can be stubborn but he is honorable
Fair Hades is a master of darkness and
deceit The personification of evil
When he finds out that you arent the
lightning thief hell kill both you and
your Mother

There is SILENCE Percy is DEVASTATED HELPLESS

PERCY
So What can I do

Chiron rises up his wound dressed He places his arm firmly
on Percys shoulder LOOKS him in the eye

CHIRON
Stay with our original plan Tomorrow
we go to Olympus Once youve convinced
Zeus of your innocence we will do
everything in our power to bring your
Mother back I swear

looks at Chiron and slowly nods Grover and Annabeth
exchange a glance

bends down LOWERS her head into the cooler When she pulls
her head out each of her hair-snakes has a MOUSE in its
mouth swallowing them Its a HORRIFIC SIGHT This causes
the snakes to CALM down slightly stop fighting each other

Medusa approaches the girls Annabeth recoils in horror as

RESIST a peek She looks and is HYPNOTIZED As she stares
into Medusas eyes she begins to TURN TO STONE Her hand
TURNS TO STONE still holding Annabeths arm Annabeth
shudders CANT BREAK FREE from the cement grip

Medusa MOVES her face to within inches of Annabeths face

Ares STRUTS down the restaurant aisle Percy Annabeth and
Grover are behind him Ares walks by each booth his mere
presence EVOKES CALAMITY and TENSION As Ares passes babies

Why are you really here Ares

ARES
Chiron sent me

ANNABETH
Why

ARES

To bring you to Olympus

PERCY
Well get there We got time

ARES
Not much You checked out the weather
recently

The kids LOOK OUT the window The sky above is filled with
swiftly MOVING BLACK CLOUDS OMINOUS THREATENING

ARES
Every day it gets worse That means
Zeus and Poseidon are gearin up for
battle Summer solstice is only ten
days from now And if the bolt isnâ€™t
returned to Zeus by then Itâ€™s war

PERCY
Iâ€™m getting my Mom first

ARES
Kinda selfish kid Putting your
personal feelings over the fate of
civilization

PERCY

Once Zeus finds out Im not the
Lightning Thief word will spread
fast Then Hades will kill my Mother

ARES
True

PERCY
So I need to save her first then
convince Zeus of my innocence

ARES
Unfortunately you donâ€™t have much choice
in the matter Youâ€™re my prisoner now

The waitress ARRIVES with the burgers Ares lifts the burger
bun examines the beef He SNAPS at the waitress

The patrons do as theyre told Ares LOOKS BACK to Percy
GRINS as if nothing happened speaks calmly

ARES
So if you arent the Lightning Thief
Who is

GROVER
Hades

ARES
No way

GROVER
If Hades possesses the bolt and the son
of Poseidon he has all the power and
leverage he needs to take over Olympus
Ill bet hes using Percyâ€™s Mom to lure
him into a trap

ARES
Hades isnâ€™t that bright No whoever
took the bolt would be much more
clever someone who would want to

start a war of the Gods
The kids look at Ares accusingly

ARES (CONTâ€™D)
Oh Because Im the God of War I took
it WRONG My business is all down
here on earth And if you havent
noticed its booming right now

ANNABETH

Then who else would steal it
ARES

strategist
(turns to Annabeth)

ANNABETH

Grover and Percy turn to Annabeth

ANNABETH (CONTD)

Grover is Percys protector But why did
you come along To keep an eye on these
two To get rid of all the loose
ends

ANNABETH
(furious passionate)

Ares glances to the rearview mirror

ANNABETH
Do we really look like we can defeat
Hades Iâ€™m betting that we get killed
on our little suicide mission Im
betting we never even make it to Olympus
that Zeus never gets his bolt And you
know what that means

mixture of street and gang symbols

Percy looks closely at the graffiti Its actually GREEK
LETTERS As he stares at them they take shape so that we
recognize them

PERCY
Abandon all hope ye who enter here

Percy reaches out and GENTLY TOUCHES the H surface There
is a LOUD CREAKING SOUND The H SPINS like a REVOLVING
DOOR sending Percy Annabeth and Grover INSIDE the sign

INT HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT

The revolving H STOPS TRANSPORTING the kids into a
cramped dark room CARVED into the grassy muddy earth
Grover pulls out a pack of matches LIGHTS ONE This
ILLUMINATES the three kids and the FACE of

VIRGIL
He is tall bone thin with long grey hair piercing eyes

and a haunted tragic expression His skin is pale with a
blue tint He is dressed in flowing DARK ROBES

SURPRISED by Virgils appearance the kids JUMP BACK

GROVER
The angel of death

A tiny smile appears on Virgils face

VIRGIL
Nothing so sinister Im afraid Im
Virgil Guide of the underworld

VIRGIL
Die and come back

Virgil turns moving back into the DARKNESS

PERCY

Virgil pauses EXTENDS his hand Grover puts all their cash
in the palm It instantly INCINERATES Virgil TURNS AWAY

PERCY
Wait

Percy pulls out the GOLD DRACHMAS he stole from Medusas
emporium DROPS them into Virgils hand Virgil examines the
ancient drachmas and smiles

Suddenly the H SPINS AGAIN REVOLVING Percy Annabeth and
Grover OUT OF THE ROOM

EXT HOLLYWOOD SIGN - DAY

The REVOLVING H stops The kids are now BACK OUTSIDE

GROVER
He tricked us

ANNABETH
Not exactly--

They turn now overlooking the UNDERWORLD the dark
ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE of Los Angeles The expansive view of
Hollywood has changed dramatically a POST-APOCALYPTIC vision
of the sunny green landscape

Scattered FIRES RAGE throughout the hills BLACK SMOKE rises
from varied spots SWIRLING into the BLOOD RED SKY Homes
and buildings are burnt out smoking VACANT Cars BURN
many just skeletal FRAMES

The streets of are filled with hundreds of SOULS OF THE
DEPARTED They are white ZOMBIE-LIKE figures wandering
aimlessly through the city The Souls are dressed in
tattered dirty clothes like homeless spectres The sound
of their painful WAILING and MOANS echo through the air

Virgil APPEARS beside Percy Grover and Annabeth who stare
in horror at the sight before them

VIRGIL
Welcome to the underworld

Virgil extends a TORCH

VIRGIL
Ill take you to Hades

EXT UNDERWORLD STREETS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Virgil leads the kids through the streets making their way
through BURNT OUT cars carcasses of DEAD ANIMALS and crowds
of WANDERING SOULS Percy is ARMED with his shield and
SWORD Annabeth holds her BOW and ARROW Grover clutches
his DAGGER As the kids PASS the souls TOUCH them GRAB
their hands PULL their hair

VIRGIL
Souls of the recently departed waiting
to find out what level of the underworld
theyll be sent to They are harmless
When they sense a living person they
touch them Its comforting reminds
them of lifes warmth

One of the souls CARESSES Grovers cheek He is REVOLTED

GROVER
Ewwww Sooo cold

EXT HADES MANSION - LATER - DAY

Virgil leads Annabeth Percy and Grover to the entrance of
Hades home a huge ratty dilapidated MANSION surrounded
by RUSTED IRON GATES The facade is CRUMBLING filled with
CRACKS Windows are BROKEN Horrible sounds of SCREAMING
and INHUMAN GROWLING echo from inside the mansion Virgil
removes a rusty RING OF KEYS finds one and OPENS the gate

VIRGIL
Well find Hades inside

The kids step through the gate The Souls of the Departed
try to follow Virgil KEEPS them back CLOSING the gates
Virgil leads Percy Grover and Annabeth through the overgrown
lawn toward the FRONT DOOR There is a GROWLING SOUND

A few feet away TWO HELLHOUNDS feast on the carcass of a
DEAD ANIMAL They LOOK UP seeing Percy The Hellhounds
MOVE TOWARD Percy He EXTENDS his sword The hellhounds
RETRACT staying back not taking their eyes off of the kids

Virgil leads Percy Annabeth and Grover onto the crumbling
stone porch toward the ROTTING FRONT DOOR The rusted brass
KNOCKER is shaped like a LARGE EAGLE Percy REACHES UP to
knock Virgil TRIES to stop him

VIRGIL
That s--

But Percy GRABS the knocker anyway The BRASS EAGLE COMES TO
LIFE SCREECHES and BITES Percys HAND Percy LEAPS BACK
his hand BLOODIED He LOOKS to the door The knocker is
BACK TO NORMAL

VIRGIL

hallway flanked by a TWISTING STAIRCASE Furniture and
lighting fixtures are covered in mounds of DUST and COBWEBS
RATS play on the floor scattered SPIDERS and LIZARDS crawl
along the walls Floorboards sections of the staircase

Grover STEPS onto a rotted section of the floor It BREAKS
AWAY Grover FALLS GRABBING onto the edge BELOW HIM is a
large BASEMENT filled with angry hungry LOST SOULS These
are very DIFFERENT creatures from the lost souls in the
streets They are VICIOUS DEADLY They GRAB and CLAW at
Grovers legs trying to PULL HIM DOWN BELOW

Grover KICKS and SCREAMS managing to KNOCK a few of them
away Percy and Annabeth PULL at Grover trying to SAVE HIM
Finally they PULL HIM to safety

GROVER

Sitting in one chair watching the screaming souls is
PERSEPHONE Hades wife She is dressed in black with long
dark hair Her beauty is MASKED by pale skin Goth make-up

bones flickering with an INNER GOLDEN LIGHT rests on a
pedestal beside Hades

Percy Annabeth and Grover enter led by Virgil Persephone

Virgil CLEARS his throat

VIRGIL

Hades TURNS looks at the kids He STANDS walks to them

Hades instantly TRANSFORMS into a HORRIFIC TEN-FOOT HIGH
FLAMING-WINGED DEMON GOD He gets RIGHT IN Annabeths face

DEMON HADES

The kids are FREAKED even Virgil is terrified Hades
returns to NORMAL Virgil NERVOUSLY backs out of the room

VIRGIL
Well It appears that my services are
no longer needed Good luck Mr

Jackson Enjoy your stay

Virgil practically STUMBLES over himself RUNNING OUT of the
room Hades RAISES AN EYEBROW to Percy

HADES

You are brave to come here nephew
I can see the disgust in your eyes
Disgust for my world for what I have
become But this was not my choice I
was banished here by Zeus and your
Father And they have succeeded in
making my life a

(irony not lost)
Living hell

(points to food)
Do you know what its like to be me
Every feeling has been taken away
I feel no joy I feel no pain I
am hungry but I cannot taste I
am tired but I cannot sleep

(looks at Persephone)
I am in love But I can never
fulfill my desire

Persephone turns away Hades points to the screaming
writhing souls that SCREAM from his fireplace

HADES

The only pleasure in my life is
human suffering When others feel
pain when others experience hurt
and tragedy I feel total and
complete joy I feed on misery

(a beat)
I am damned to this existence
And my only chance of getting out
of here is by defeating my brothers
and taking control of Olympus But

(extends hand to Percy)
I need the bolt

PERCY
(eyes burning)
And I need my Mother

HADES
Give me the bolt And you will see
her again

PERCY
Im not the Lightning Thief I dont
have the bolt I never did

HADES
Do you take me for a fool

Percy holds up his SHIELD and SWORD for protection

HADES
Give it to me or say goodbye to
your Mother

Hades turns GRABS the human bone globe from its pedestal and
THROWS it onto the ground directly in front of Percy The
globe EXPLODES and there frozen in a SHOWER OF GOLD just
as she was when the Minotaur was about to kill her is
Percys mom UNCONSCIOUS The shower of light DISSIPATES
Percys mom WAKES sits up sees her son

Sally LOOKS AROUND at her surroundings

SALLY

GROVER
Not yet But were working on it

Hades SEES something OFFSCREEN that catches his attention
Percys SHIELD It lies FACE DOWN The handle appears to be
GLOWING SURGING with LIGHT

Hades walks up to the shield PICKS it up Hades RIPS the
golden handle from the shield The handle TRANSFORMS into a
long clear cylinder filled with surging white LIGHTNING

HADES
Zeus master bolt
(to Percy)
You lied
PERCY

ANNABETH

(a realization)
We were set-up

GROVER
Luke was the Lightning Thief
HADES

Hades turns to Persephone

HADES

a series of tunnels that stretch into DARKNESS The walls

the middle of the cellar

ANNABETH
I never would have suspected Luke

PERCY
But why did he hide the bolt in his
shield Why did he give it to me

GROVER
Add that to the long list of things
Ill never know Like the feeling of
a naked woman or the sweet smell of--

There is a LOUD GRINDING SOUND In the middle of the stone
floor BRICKS SEPARATE The floor begins to SLIDE OPEN
revealing a deep PIT Inside there is

A WHIRLPOOL OF FIRE

From deep in the pit within the flames something STIRS
It ROARS Then SCREAMS

Everyone RUNS to the side of the cellar CLUTCHING the walls
for dear life The floor continues to SLIDE OPEN revealing
the waiting FLAMES directly beneath them

A GIANT DEMON-LIKE FACE made entirely of flames APPEARS in
the whirlpool

PERCY
Whats that
GROVER
Kronos Father of the Gods
Technically your Grandfather

PERCY
My Grandfather

GROVER
You my friend are the proud member
of a very dysfunctional family
(a beat)
Think your old man was a Deadbeat Dad
At least he didnt eat his kids

The face of Kronos ROARS The floor CONTINUES TO SLIDE
OPEN

GROVER
(nervously)
Or his grandkids

Only a FEW FEET OF FLOOR REMAIN Grover and Sally CLUTCH to
the walls for dear life Annabeth WRAPS her arms around
Percy holds him tight WHISPERS in his ear

ANNABETH
A sonnet from ancient Greece
(softly)

He is more than a hero
(through tears)
He is a god in my eyes

The floor continues to OPEN INCHES AWAY from everyone
falling to their deaths

Annabeth and Percy SHARE A FINAL KISS MOMENTS from death
Sally WITNESSES this sees that her son has FOUND LOVE

Suddenly the floor STOPS OPENING Everyone EXCHANGES a
puzzled look HOLDING ONTO the tiny ledge of rock The
ROARING FLAMING FACE OF KRONOS screams from below

The floor BEGINS TO CLOSE

The kids and Sally look bewildered as the FLOORS CLOSES
BELOW them much to the dismay of a SCREAMING KRONOS

Hades has been cruel and abusive
forcing me into a loveless marriage
Like your Mother I was abducted by
Hades I agreed to be his wife only
if he would allow me to return to the
surface for three months each year Its
all that I have to look forward to A
war of the Gods will destroy everything
I hold dear in the mortal world

PERCY
Well do everything we can to stop it

Persephone nods smiles She looks at them

PERSEPHONE

Grover removes the THREE GREEN PEARLS from his backpack
PERSEPHONE
Only three
(Grover nods)
One of you will have to stay behind

ANNABETH
What do you mean

PERSEPHONE
Each pearl protects only a single person
Whoevers blood touches it

The kids look at each other unaware of that

PERSEPHONE
Make your choice quickly

Sally turns to Percy

EXPLODE in a green flash ENVELOPING Sally and Annabeth in a
separate GREEN SPHERE

Each sphere begins to FLOAT OFF off the floor

suddenly ENVELOPED in the sphere Percy LOOKS to Grover

Luke HOVERS several feet above them wearing his own very

cool very sleek WINGED SHOES

PERCY
Luke Why did you steal Zeus bolt

LUKE
To start a war between Poseidon and Zeus

PERCY
Thats why you hid it in your shield
and gave it to me

BUZZING SOUND They look to the DIRECTION of the sound

The sound EMANATES from the bolt in Lukes hand There is a
HAIRLINE CRACK at the top of the bolt BRIGHT tentacled
SPARKS OF ELECTRICITY emit from the crack

Luke GENTLY MOVES his hand

The slightest movement RELEASES LIGHTNING from the bolt The
STRONGER the movement the more ELECTRICITY is released

Lukes eyes burn with a newfound POWER Percy CALLS to him

PERCY
Why do you want a war of the gods

LUKE
Control Theyve been in power for too
Many years Its time for our generation
to take over Centuries ago the
Olympians defeated their parents and took
control Why shouldnt we do the same

ANNABETH
Because youll destroy all of mankind
in the process

LUKE
Exactly Giving the young Gods an
opportunity to start over to create
a new world of heroes
PERCY
Youre no hero

With a quick SNAP of his wrist Luke TRIGGERS the bolt
A BLAST OF LIGHTING shoots out and blows a MASSIVE HOLE into

the building behind Percy Annabeth and Sally They LEAP OUT
OF THE WAY as concrete and brick fall around them

Luke smiles glances to the bolt impressed
Percy glances to a nearby FIRE HYDRANT CONCENTRATING on it

PERCY
I didnt steal the lightning bolt If
my father had asked me to do something

for him I would have said no
(indifferent)

I have no loyalty to him I owe him

nothing

Poseidon lowers his head slightly Zeus smiles amused

ZEUS
I believe you owe your personality to
him
(pauses curious)
But if you didnt take the bolt Why
do you have it

PERCY
It was stolen by Luke son of Hermes

HERMES
(surprised)
I have a son named Luke

Zeus raises an eyebrow to Percy

ZEUS
Why should I believe you
PERCY
You dont have to All you have to do
is honor your word Ive returned the
bolt by the summer solstice Now call
off the war

Zeus turns to Poseidon back to Percy

ZEUS
For the sake of peace in our family

You have done me a great service
If theres ever anything I can do

ANNABETH
The son of Poseidon and the daughter
of Athena are officially--

PERCY
--In love
They exchange a KISS much to the shock of Athena and
Poseidon Annabeth looks at Athena and Poseidon

ANNABETH
I think its about time you two
stopped hating on each other

Poseidon and Athena sigh holding back their anger putting
aside their feelings For now Zeus finds it all very
amusing laughing

ZEUS
Our meeting is adjourned
(glares at Poseidon)
I still dont trust you

And with that Zeus VANISHES in a blinding flash of
lightning Athena LOOKS at Annabeth

ATHENA
Well discuss this later young lady

Athena VANISHES All of the Gods begin to VANISH One by
one Everyone EXCEPT POSEIDON

He looks down catches Sallys eye for the first time
Poseidon steps off the throne walks forward With each
step he becomes SMALLER soon becoming the size of a MORTAL
Poseidon walks to Sally gives her a TENDER KISS

POSEIDON
Good to see you Sally You look
beautiful

SALLY
You too Of course you have that
eternal youth thing going on

They exchange a warm SMILE Poseidon turns approaches
Percy They look at each other An estranged Father and
son meeting for the FIRST TIME Its TENSE UNCOMFORTABLE

POSEIDON
I cant thank you enough Percy Few
heroes in history could have accomplished
what youve done Im proud of you son--

He EXTENDS his hand Percy IGNORES it COLDLY There is a
long silence YEARS OF TENSION between them Sally nods to
Annabeth and Chiron LOOKS BACK to Percy

SALLY
Well leave you two alone

Sally Annabeth and Chiron move several feet away Percy
TURNS to the window looks out over the lands of Olympus

POSEIDON
Im not asking you to like me

PERCY
No need I didnt do it for you
I did it to save mom

POSEIDON
I know that

Percy continues to stare out at the LANDSCAPE OF OLYMPUS his
back turned too Poseidon Percy has so many questions He
speaks softly a DEEP SADNESS in his voice

PERCY
How old was I When you left

POSEIDON
Seven months

PERCY
Do you remember any of it

POSEIDON
Every moment You were a beautiful
boy Your Mother and I were in love
I could have stayed forever

PERCY
But you didnt

POSEIDON
I had other responsibilities

PERCY
More important than us

Percy turns FACES Poseidon who doesnt answer

PERCY
I didnt care if you were there all the
time But I would have liked to see
you even for a day an hour
(upset)
Why didnt you ever come back

POSEIDON

(pauses difficult)
I wanted to I just When I was with
you and your MotherI became less
concerned about my responsibilities
I was ignoring my natural destiny

(softly)
I was becoming human
PERCY
And thats bad

POSEIDON
For a God For the future of the

universe Yes Percy Thats bad

PERCY

What about these last two weeks

I

almost died out there But you didnt

do anything You didnt help me

POSEIDON

I was looking out for you every step

of the way When you needed me I

was there Who do you think sent the
horses in the desert Who spoke to you

gave you clarity in Lotus Land
(passionate)

Just because you didnt see me doesnt
mean I wasnt there When you sit in
the bottom of the pool trying to figure
out your life the voice in your head

is me

PERCY
(understanding)
So thats you

POSEIDON
(nods )

Passing out what advice I can Most
of which you tend to ignore by the

way

A TINY SMILE appears on Percys face Percy
understands how complicated this must be for

POSEIDON
I know this isnt the father-son
relationship youve always wanted
but its the best I can do
(sincere)
I hope someday youll see that

PERCY
(long pause)
Olympus wasnt built in a day

softens
his Father

Poseidon smiles EXTENDS his hand again Percy pauses

slowly SHAKES IT

Poseidon pulls him close in for an EMBRACE
hug
