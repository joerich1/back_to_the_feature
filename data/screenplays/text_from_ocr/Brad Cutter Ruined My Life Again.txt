FADE IN
A SEA OF BLACK GRADUATION GOWNS shuffles by

“Pomp and Circumstance” (the graduation march) BLARES from a
crappy sound system

Flashbulbs POP We are
INT AUDITORIUM - GRADUATION DAY
Eager high school seniors accept their diplomas
One awkward graduate makes his way across the stage This is
DAVE FISCHMAN He pauses as his picture is snapped Bad
hair acne and headgear hide honest eyes and a good heart
DAVE (V0)
For me the only good thing about
high school

Dave and the other graduates throw their caps into the air

DAVE (V0O) (cont’d)
»was that it ended

Dave looks up just as a cap comes hurtling back down pointy
corner first and nails him right in the eye We hear a
blood curdling SCREAM

GO TO BLACK

DAVE (VO) (cont’d)
At least I thought it did

cur TO
INT HOUSE - DAY

Dave now with a medical eye patch sits alone miserably
picking at a piece of cake at his empty graduation party

DAVE (V0O)
That’s me twelve years ago The
six hours spent at the emergency
room and the scratched cornea
pretty much sucked the life out of
that party It was a fitting end
to a miserable four years

INT HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY —- DAY

Dave head down and headgear on hurries through the hall
DAVE (V0)
The best way to understand who I
was in high school is to
understand who I was not

Dave rounds a corner

DAVE (VO) (cont’d)
And I was definitely NOT Brad
Cutter

Coming around the corner in the other direction is BRAD
CUTTER - good looking charismatic confident Picture the
coolest guy from your high school multiply by ten and you
get the idea

Dave ducks out of the way as Brad and his hangers-on plow
through the hallway laughing and living it up

DAVE (VO) (cont’d)
Brad Cutter went to his first
senior prom when he was in eighth
grade

football games for the video
yearbook
Dave loads a tape into his video camera on the sidelines of a
football game Suddenly a RECEIVER and TWO DEFENDERS going
for an overthrown ball slam into Dave crushing him to the
ground

DAVE (VO) (contd)
While Brad Cutter was having porno-
level sex with prom queen Jenny
Hanson

genius I was just a dork

Dave takes the joystick from Simon

YOUNG DAVE
Awesome

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT
A quiet house sits on a suburban street

DAVE (V0)
But the worst thing about not being
Brad Cutter was that I’d never be
more than study buddies with Kara
Blanchard

INT KARA’S DEN - NIGHT

Dave sits with KARA a cute mousy high school girl A muted
TV plays in the background as they pore over open math books

KARA
I still don’t understand how to
find the cosine

DAVE
It’s really tricky Here if you
just --

The back door opens and KARA’S STEP-MOM enters carrying a
couple of grocery bags and smoking a cigarette She glares
at Dave and Kara

KARA’S STEPMOM
Oh look another tutoring session
What test are you gonna fail
tomorrow Kara

As Kara’s step-mom leaves the room Kara gives her the finger
through the wall Dave assessing the scene speaks up
DAVE
(loudly for step-mom’s
benefit)
Oh thanks Kara I get it now I
needed to multiply the binomial by
the square root

Kara gives Dave a confused look Dave winks and continues

DAVE (cont’d)
Now can you help me with number 17

Kara’s step-mom pokes her head around the wall curiously
KARA
(getting it now)
Sure You take the factorial
here

Kara’s step-mom looks impressed She heads up the stairs
Kara giggles

KARA (cont’d)

Thanks

DAVE
No problem Factorial was a nice
touch

Kara smiles at Dave He smiles back

KARA
Want a Coke

DAVE
Yeah definitely

Kara goes to the kitchen Dave feels like he’s in He pulls
off his headgear He checks his breath He fixes his hair

Kara emerges with two drinks

KARA
Oh my god

Kara runs right past Dave to the TV and turns up the sound

On screen Brad Cutter is being interviewed in the locker
room after a basketball game He has no shirt on

CUTTER (ON TV)
I really owe it all to my
teammates

KARA
He is so hot
She SHRIEKS Dave slowly picks up his headgear and puts it
back on It’s hopeless

DAVE (V0)
When high school finally ended it
was reason to celebrate

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

A huge bonfire rages Hot guys and girls drink dance and
make out Brad Cutter and Jenny Hanson are the center of
attention

DAVE (V0)
Yeah right like I knew about that
party

cut TO
EXT DAVE’S BACKYARD - SAME NIGHT

Dave with the eye patch and Simon stand over a small fire
they’ve built in a bucket Dave holds his high school
yearbook over the fire

DAVE
To the end

Dave drops it in the fire Simon adds a Franklin High PE
shirt to the fire

SIMON
Good riddance

Dave blasts the bucket with some lighter fluid The fire
flares up

SIMON (contd)
Nice You realize this is just the
beginning right

DAVE
I guess so

SIMON
Dave high school is just something
guys like us survive The rest of
our lives is our reward

Dave looks unsure

SIMON (contd)
Brad Cutter and those guys’1ll be
pumping our gas Jenny Hanson’s
gonna be a 300 pound divorcee by
the time she hits thirty

(MORE)
SIMON (cont’d)
It’s karma It’s cosmic justice
They all peaked in high school
It’s pathetic

DAVE
Yeah pathetic

Just then JUDY FISCHMAN Dave’s mom comes running out of
the house with a pitcher of water She dumps it on the fire

JUDY
David Have you lost your mind

DAVE

your eye with fluid

right around the corner

Dave clicks the mouse a few times and types something on his
keyboard Reveal that on Dave’s computer screen is a color

coded graph that shows his progress toward a promotion

DAVE (VO) (cont’d)
That promotion was the final step
for me and when it came I was
gonna do it I was gonna ask Leah
to marry me

Dave clicks the mouse again and now a new graph comes on
screen showing the growth of his “Engagement Ring Fund

fund is up to almost 8000

Dave leans back in his chair and smiles at the graph

DAVE (VO) (contd)
See Leah Marshak was the best
thing that had ever happened to me

The table erupts in laughter Dave chuckles as if he gets it
and scans for a way to be a part of it

Dave walks to the next nearest table sets down his tray and
starts to drag a chair towards the cool table

Dave pulls but the chair jerks back stopping him cold The
chair is chained to its table

Determined Dave begins a tedious process of dragging the
entire table over He must drag the table and each of its
four chairs slowly awkwardly painfully one bit at a time
toward the cool table

To make matters worse the stuff is so heavy that as Dave
drags all the metal SCRAPES the concrete ground insanely
loudly

Everyone from the cool table looks over at the noise Dave
tries to smile and act nonchalant Everyone turns back to
Cutter

Dave continues struggling each drag making a horrendous
sound until he finally gets a chair close enough to sit
directly behind someone at the cool table

Sweating from exertion Dave sits down trying to balance his
tray on his lap and eat without spilling his soup Dave
tries to crane his neck to see Cutter and get in on the
conversation

CUTTER (cont’d)
And that was my third time there
so I’m thinking ---

BEEP BEEP BEEP A nearby truck is backing up and Dave can’t
hear what’s going on He tries hard but it’s useless

Finally the beeping stops Just as it does everyone bursts
out laughing again Then almost as one everyone stands up

Within seconds the entire table led by Cutter has cleared
the area Dave is left with his lunch on his lap

A BUILDING SECURITY GUARD approaches

SECURITY GUARD
Sir you’re gonna have to move this
table back

Dave looks miserable
INT CENTERPOINT OFFICES HALLWAY - DAY

Dave covered in sweat from moving the table back walks down
the hall He passes the copy room and does a double take

Outside the door a maintenance guy finishes putting up a
placard engraved with the words “The Pit” Dave can’t
believe it

INT JANITOR’S CLOSET - DAY
Dave uses paper towels to wipe the sweat off his face

ARTURO

DAVE

Dave takes a deep breath and smiles Arturo’s right
INT CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

The room is filled with Centerpoint staff and a group of
EXECUTIVES from Just Juice Dave stands in the front of the
room by a power-point slide showing an elaborate graph

DAVE
(confident )
Phase 2 of our five pronged attack
is to incentivize end-users while
reinforcing the base strategy
(MORE)

DAVE (contd)
(new slide)
As you’ll see --

VOICE
Let me stop you there

Dave looks up in shock

DAVE
Excuse me

Reveal PALMER GAINES 50s CEO of Just Juice Gaines is
slick and corporate but with a harsh edge

GAINES
Look your charts and graphs are
all well and good but I really
don’t give a shit

DAVE
Uh I --

Gaines stands up for effect

GAINES
I need to sell juice Lots of it
I want my socks knocked off I
want to get a goddamn boner for my
juice

No one knows quite what to say Whitman jumps in

WHITMAN
Mr Gaines let me assure you this
is just the very beginning of our
work on the account Centerpoint
will develop a thorough and
innovative campaign

GAINES
Frankly you’re gonna have to
Alex We’re bidding other firms
and we’re not messing around This
promotion needs to - Make Juice

A palpable tremor goes through the room Dave looks sick to
his stomach

Cutter who’s sitting off to the side stands up and looks
Gaines right in the eyes

CUTTER
You won’t need any other firms Mr
Gaines When we’re through you’re
just gonna need to make more juice

Cutter smiles big and looks right at Gaines Gaines looks
back at Cutter Then a huge smile spreads on his face too

GAINES
Goddamnit I like this guy Who is

Everyone exhales Wow

WHITMAN
This is Brad Cutter he’s new He
was just sitting in today he --

GAINES
Cutter it’s good to have you on
the team

Gaines reaches out and shakes his hand Dave looks shocked

GAINES (cont’d)
That’s it We’re done here

Immediately all the Just Juice guys pack up and head out of
the conference room

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The Centerpoint employees are still in the room A loud
murmur can be heard as they try to assess what just happened

The room goes silent as Whitman walks back in shutting the
door behind him He strides to the front

WHITMAN
Well you all heard him Palmer
Gaines just threw down the
gauntlet and we are going to get
the job done I want every
resource poured into this thing
If he wants juice to be cool we
are not going to sleep until juice
is so goddamn cool that my son and
his friends are sneaking flasks of
it on the back of the bus Got it

An acquiescent murmur runs through the group

WHITMAN (cont’d)
I want two separate teams working
creative on this A little
competition might be just what we
need Dave I want you heading up
one team

Dave smiles big He could almost burst with pride

WHITMAN (cont’d)

INT CENTERPOINT OFFICES - DAY

Cutter and other members of his “cool group” laugh and joke
together as they work on their project From nearby Dave

INT CENTERPOINT OFFICES HALLWAY - DAY

Dave walks down the hall He stops in shock staring at a
“Vote for Gina” poster on the wall Unbelievable

EXT CENTERPOINT OFFICES - DAY

Dave gets to lunch early and sits down at the “cool table”
He smiles to himself satisfied

A big group of Centerpoint employees including Cutter exit
the building and sit down at a table on the other side of the
eating area making it the new cool table

Every seat is immediately full Dave is screwed again

INT CENTERPOINT OFFICES HALLWAY - DAY

Dave sees a line of employees waiting in the hall He leans
into Will Stenson at the back of the line

a presentation Dave looks over toward Cutter

Ann Danelli passes Cutter a folded up note Cutter opens it
and chuckles Dave stares longing to be cool

INT CENTERPOINT OFFICES HALLWAY - DAY

Dave walks along the hall He notices that now there are a
half dozen colorful sparkly “Vote for Gina” signs

ANWAR the foreign computer tech walks by
DAVE

Look at this Anwar What are we

in tenth grade
Anwar looks at Dave like he’s crazy and moves on
EXT CENTERPOINT OFFICES - DAY
Dave is early for lunch again Cleverly he puts his tray
with his salad and drink down at one table then moves to the
other table and puts his entree down and drapes his sport
coat over a chair He smiles at his own genius

Dave turns and notices that a FEMALE JANITOR has grabbed his
tray from the first table and is heading for a garbage can

DAVE
No

Dave hustles over just as she throws his food away

DAVE (cont’d)
Shit

The janitor gives him a look Dave turns back just as Cutter
and his entourage sit at the newly empty table Of course
there’s no seat for Dave

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Dave sits with his group of misfits
DAVE
(encouraging)
Alright guys we can do this
Think cool Think juice Hit me

PHILLIPS
Talking oranges

DAVE
Okay maybe

BRENNEMAN
We could do song parodies It
worked for Weird Al

DAVE
Hmmm Let’s uh keep ‘em coming

Just then Cutter and his cool group walk by outside the
glass walls of the conference room Dave looks longingly as
they seem to be having a great time

INT CENTERPOINT OFFICES HALLWAY - DAY

Next to a slew of “Vote for Gina” signs Dave puts up a
pathetic hand-scrawled “Vote for Dave” sign He steps back
and looks at it The tape gives and it falls off the wall
CLOSE ON A FIRE ALARM GOING OFF

EXT CENTERPOINT OFFICES - DAY

Everyone from the office comes out a side door of the

Dave counts heads and looks around Several people are
missing

EXT BACK OF BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Dave rounds the corner and finds Cutter and a few members of
his group smoking behind the building

DAVE

the appointed spot

CUTTER
What Are we gonna get detention

They all have a good laugh
END MONTAGE
INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A full company meeting takes place to discuss Just Juice
Dave has the floor

DAVE
So as you’ll see in the chart on
page five if we can create “cool”
action-points throughout the
shopping experience we can raise
the “hip” factor and be able to
maximize eyeballs

Dave looks around He notices that the response is less than
enthusiastic He tries to finish with a flourish

DAVE (cont’d)
That way we can really drive the
“coolness” of the juice home with
consumers Big time

Whitman sighs

WHITMAN
Dave the strategy’s on the money
but I’m not feeling the cool
What’s gonna rock Gaines’ world

DAVE
Song parodies

WHITMAN
Come on people This is a big
account for us We are fighting
for our lives here Cutter
where’s your group netting out

CUTTER
We’re still honing but we’re
looking to slow build tease it
stoke it dare them to come near
then fire off a power play Hit
‘em hard send ‘em straight to the
juice aisle

A beat as everyone soaks this in then

WHITMAN
That is exactly what I’m talking
about

Cutter leans back and smiles His group looks happy Dave
is beside himself

DAVE
Power play

Whitman stands up

WHITMAN
Listen up everybody This account
is it for us This could make or
break our year Promotions
bonuses everything hinges on Just
Juice I didn’t want to go there
but we could even be looking at
downsizing if we don’t nail it

The mood in the room goes sour Everyone seems nervous

ECKERS
Downsizing

More tension Cutter leans in and smiles

CUTTER
Whitsie don’t you worry
(dramatic pause)
We’re gonna fuck this baby
sideways

There’s a brief moment of shocked silence at the profanity
then everyone bursts out laughing Huge laughter The
tension is completely broken

Everyone is happy Dave tries to ride the good feelings

DAVE
Yeah let’s assrape this donkey

All laughter stops Silence Disgusted looks That could
not have been received any worse SHEILA HYDALE 40’s from
accounting bursts into tears and runs out of the room

DAVE (cont’d)
Wait no that came out wrong

Everyone stares daggers at Dave

EXT PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

The baseball diamond is set up for softball tryouts
Employees from Centerpoint warm up

Dave arrives and starts stretching He looks tense but
hopeful

LEAH (0S8)
Hey sweetie

Dave looks up and sees that Leah has come to watch She
looks adorable in a baseball hat Her presence makes Dave
even more nervous but he tries not to show it

DAVE
You made it Great

They kiss Just then Sheila walks by and gives Dave a dirty
look Leah notices

LEAH
What was that about

DAVE
Just a misunderstanding

LEAH
Oh You get out there and kick
some ass today alright

Leah smacks Dave on the butt He heads out to the field
Leah sits down in the bleachers

LEAH (cont’d)
Let’s go Dave C’mon Fischman

Dave smiles up at Leah She’s pretty great Dave sizes up
the tryouts and notices three young super athletic GUYS
warming up He’s never seen them before As he tries to
figure out who they are Whitman walks by

WHITMAN
Like the new “interns” Noseplug
Cutter found ‘em One of ‘em had a
tryout with the Padres last year
Whitman walks away happily Dave looks nervous
EXT PARK - LATER
The tryouts begin

- Dave’s up to bat Leah cheers her support One of the
interns pitches Dave strikes out swinging Ouch

- Dave plays shortstop He gets the ball Cutter barks at
him in confusing baseball lingo Dave isn’t sure what to do
He hesitates All the runners are safe

- Dave’s up again He makes contact for an infield dribbler
The interns turn a super slick double play Dave can’t
believe it

- Dave plays catcher One of the interns is running for
home Dave catches the ball It’s a play at the plate The
intern plows into Dave - hard Think Pete Rose Dave drops
the ball Safe Leah cringes

EXT PARK - LATER

The tryouts continue Dave looking beaten down plays
second base

LEAH
Go Dave You’re doing great

Dave forces a smile at Leah

Merrill steps up to the plate The pitch comes in and CRACK
he pops it high into the air

Dave looks up it’s definitely his ball

DAVE
I got it I got it

Dave tries to keep his eye on the high pop-up when out of
the corner of his eye he sees her Dave does a double
take Time stops

Walking to the bleachers is JENNY HANSON It’s unmistakably
her Twelve years later and the former prom queen looks even
better than she did in high school She’s beautiful and sexy
and perfect

Dave stares at her as she waves at Cutter

The ball hits the ground

WHITMAN
Noseplug look alive

Dave back in reality grabs the ball and throws to first
Of course Merrill is safe

Cutter walks up to Dave
CUTTER

(sarcastic)
Nice play dude
DAVE
(awestruck)
Jenny Hanson
CUTTER

Dave looks back to the

stands and sees that Jenny Hanson is sitting next to Leah

They’re chatting

Dave shakes that off and tries to get ready for the next

batter
INT CAR - LATER

reads it again He reads it one more time

DAVE
Damnit

Dave grabs the list off the wall and crumples it up

ANWAR (0S)

Dave turns to find that Anwar is standing behind him

DAVE
Sorry

Dave carefully un-crumples the list smoothes it out on the
table and tapes it back up Anwar steps up and looks at it

He pumps his fist turns and leaves

INT CUTTER’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Cutter throws a pair of gym shorts at Dave

Boring No crazy prescriptions nothing embarrassing He
sees a men’s skin cream

DAVE
Ha somebody has dry skin

Dave starts to put it back then hesitates He looks at it
Hey if it works for Cutter Dave pours some onto his
hands and rubs it all over his face He smiles It feels
pretty good He puts on a little more

Dave carefully puts the skin cream back He takes one last
look around the bathroom then heads for the clothes hamper
with his stained pants

Dave opens the hamper and is about to stick his pants in when
he stops cold His eyes go wide Staring back at him is

JENNY’S HANSON’S THONG It’s lace and it’s pink and it’s
fantastic Dave can’t believe what he’s looking at Those
few square inches of fabric would have given him whack-off
material for months

Dave wants to put his pants in and walk away but he can’t
He can’t help himself He reaches in and pulls out the
thong He touches it He fondles it Yes he sniffs it

LEAH (0S)
There you are

Dave immediately balls up the tiny thong and closes his right
fist around it as he turns to face Leah He hopes to god she
didn’t notice

DAVE
Hey

Dave tries to slide the thong into his pocket Gym shorts -
no pockets Dave starts to sweat

LEAH
We’re about to play Pictionary
Turns out Jenny and I have the same
love for dorky games Plus I know
how awesome you are at it

DAVE
Oh right cool

Leah grabs Dave and pushes him ahead of her playfully
holding his shoulders

LEAH
Come on

INT CUTTER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Leah continues to hold onto Dave’s shoulders and push him
from behind This gives Dave no way to ditch the thong
He’s getting panicky

DAVE

see how great you are at this

She kisses his cheek as they enter

EXT CENTERPOINT OFFICES - MORNING

A yellow school bus idles in the parking lot Whitman stands
outside the bus looking at his watch

Dave’s car comes racing into the parking lot It pulls right
up to the bus Dave jumps out of the passenger seat He
runs up to Whitman

DAVE
Sorry I’m late

Then from behind Dave we hear

JUDY

JUDY (cont’d)
There won’t be any swimming today

have his nose plugs

DAVE
Mom

WHITMAN
(very amused)
He’1ll be fine

Whitman climbs on the bus Dave humiliated follows
INT BUS - CONTINUOUS

Dave gets on and scans the bus Everyone is on board and
there are hardly any open seats The prickly old BUS DRIVER
turns to Dave

BUS DRIVER
Proceed behind the white line
please the bus is leaving

Dave looks down and sees the classic white line that school
kids have to stay behind when the bus is in motion Dave
makes sure he clears it

The bus starts up and Dave lurches almost falls down then
begins looking for a seat

Up front he sees a broken seat with a completely messed up
cushion he keeps moving

As he makes his way down the aisle it’s clear that nearly
every seat is filled

Anwar sits by himself but hogs the seat in a way that makes
it clear that Dave isn’t welcome Dave moves on

Suddenly the bus takes a sharp turn and Dave falls right on
top of Sheila the woman he offended in the meeting His
hands land right on her boobs

SHEILA
Get off me perv

She shoves him hard

DAVE
Sorry It was an accident

Dave regains his footing as Sheila gives him a terrible look
He continues toward the back of the bus Cutter is in the
last row of course holding court with all the cool people

Dave notices that sitting on a seat near the back are several
large platters of sandwiches for lunch Dave makes a move to
try to slide the platters over but the bus turns and he
bobbles them Sandwiches pour out onto the floor

DAVE (cont’d)
Shit Sorry Damnit

Everyone rolls their eyes as Dave struggles to grab the
sandwiches and put them back on the platters Many roll off
along the floor

CUTTER
Maybe you should sit up by the
front

Dave embarrassed heads back for the front of the bus He
hurries past Sheila’s seat this time

Dave arrives at the broken seat he noticed earlier He tries
in vain to adjust it somehow so it has cushioning He leans
over to the driver

DAVE
Um excuse me —-

SCREECH The driver slams on the brakes Everyone is jostled
violently

VARIOUS
Jesus What the hell Aaaaah

The sandwiches all tumble to the floor again This time
they’re really ruined

BUS DRIVER
Behind the white line

Dave looks down His foot is over the line Dave slinks
back behind the white line and into the broken seat

As the bus starts up again everyone gives Dave dirty looks
He sits in the incredibly uncomfortable seat miserable

EXT RETREAT SITE - LATER

It’s one of those “Outward Bound” “back to nature” places
The Centerpoint employees sit in a circle on a wood patio

Cutter is surrounded by the cool people Dave is not

DAVE
(optimistic)
Hey the potato salad’s still good

A few people roll their eyes Anwar motions to his plate of
nothing but potato salad

ANWAR
Great Thanks

Dave takes some potato salad and slinks to a table Whitman
stands in front of the group

WHITMAN
Alright as you eat what’s left of
our lunch we have some business to

DAVE
Alright just for fun uh here’s a
little old school rap I wrote

awesome way On the council I

presentations we’re hitting the
ropes course You’ll be divided
into your Just Juice teams I want
to see teamwork drive and
victory

Dave’s eyes light up

EXT ROPES COURSE - LATER

The retreat center features a classic Outward Bound style
ropes course through the trees It looks complex and
somewhat treacherous

Dave has his group gathered around him He grins broadly

DAVE
Alright guys We are gonna win
this thing I may suck at poker
softball and all other conventional
sports but I spent six years at
camp Wakanabee and I ruled the
ropes course Just follow my lead

EXT ROPES COURSE - MOMENTS LATER
The teams begin the course

- The first event is a climbing wall And incredibly Dave
really is good at this He coordinates his team pulls
people up and over and looks like he knows exactly what he’s
doing Cutter’s team works hard and manages to keep pace

- Dave helps his team traverse the first rope bridge
perfectly He’s truly a master As Cutter’s team falls
behind briefly Dave almost glows

- It’s a more difficult rope bridge now and Cutter’s team
has taken the lead Dave with fire in his eyes actually
carries Brenneman on his back across one of the more
treacherous sections

- Both teams are neck in neck as they make their way across
the final obstacle Dave leads with confident efficiency

- A zip line is the final part of the course Both Dave and
Cutter jump onto side by side lines and fly down to the
bottom They finish the course tied Both look exhausted
EXT ROPES COURSE - MOMENTS LATER
Both teams have gathered Everyone looks winded and spent
WHITMAN
Wow Excellent job everyone We
have ourselves a tie
Everyone claps Dave seems disappointed
WHITMAN (cont’d)

So to break the tie this next
event is for just the team leaders

DAVE
Yes

WHITMAN
Let’s see who can make it across
‘The Widowmaker’ first

Everyone looks up at a super scary rope bridgeobstacle
course

EXT WIDOWMAKER - MOMENTS LATER

Dave and Cutter are both at the start Dave looks over at
Cutter with a confident smile He wants this bad

DAVE
May the best man win

Cutter just nods - whatever
Down below Whitman has a bullhorn

WHITMAN
Go

They take off Cutter is nimble and athletic but Dave is
determined and experienced Dave jumps out to the lead
Cutter keeps pace just behind

Down below everyone cheers and yells Cutter takes a slight
lead Dave makes a great move and powers back ahead

Dave’s lead grows His eyes burn with competitive fire He
bounds and swings recklessly craving a win

Cutter falls behind but works to steadily keep up

Dave’s lead is huge now Dave loves it It’s truly his
moment of glory

SLOW MOTION kicks in as Dave starts showboating reveling in
his imminent victory

Dave takes a huge risky leap and

WHOOOSH Dave slips through the bridge But his foot gets
tangled in the ropes His body swings out He screams
Everyone looks up as Dave sails through the air

SMACK Dave bashes face-first into a huge tree branch
Everyone cringes Dave hangs upside down by his foot His
body twists in mid air

DAVE
(weakly and muffled)
I’m okay

Dave spits blood and passes out

GO TO BLACK

EXT DAVE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

Dave’s building stands against the twilight sky

INT DAVE’S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - SAME

The elevator doors open and Leah gets out She hurries down
the hall toward Dave’s apartment She looks worried She
knocks on the door

INT DAVE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The door swings open We only see Leah’s stunned reaction

LEAH

DAVE

INT DAVE’S APARTMENT - MORNING

Dave wakes up and emerges from his couch fort His mom is at
the computer

JUDY
Good morning honey

Dave looks over his mom’s shoulder She’s IM’ing with a
couple of guys Their pictures come up with their messages
They’re both fat and neither one is Gary

DAVE
What are you doing

JUDY
Just IM’ing with a few guys

DAVE
What happened to Gary

JUDY
No chemistry

The computer makes a BOOP-BOOP sound as Judy gets another
message

JUDY (cont’d)
Cooh new message Don’t forget
your lunch when you go to work

cur TO
CLOSE ON A BROWN BAG LUNCH

It features Dave’s name with a heart around it It sits on

Dave’s desk in
INT DAVE’S OFFICE - DAY

Dave eats the bag lunch his mom made

He looks miserable

with his headgear and acne polishing off a juice box

Whitman appears at the door

WHITMAN
(re headgear)

Holy Christ What is that thing

DAVE
It immobilizes my jaw

WHITMAN

Palmer Gaines is going to be here
for the meeting soon Can you take

it off

DAVE
Not really

WHITMAN

Look Dave your little accident
kept you from presenting your
campaign at the retreat so I’m
going in blind here Don’t make me
look bad If you still want a shot
at vice president this is it

Whitman leaves Dave looks forlorn
of pain pills and takes a handful

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

He pulls out his bottle

Palmer Gaines sits with his arms crossed He’s flanked by

stoic looking Just Juice EXECUTIVES
Dave and his team prepare to present

DAVE

Whitman sits nearby

I see everyone has their packets
so you can all follow along Now
without further ado ladies and
gentleman I give you Juice

The lights go down and a screen lights up with images of
juice flowing cascading One of Dave’s team hits play on a
boom box and lame new age MUSIC plays

DAVE (cont’d)
Juice the liquid life force of our
nation The cool quenching power
of fruits and vegetables

Palmer and his executives look dubious

DAVE (cont’d)
And we say let it flow

The MUSIC kicks into high gear Brenneman flashes the lights
on and off Dave waits for something but it doesn’t seem to
be happening

DAVE (cont’d)
I said let it flow

The side door of the conference room finally opens and two
more members of the team slide in an elaborate standee It’s
an actual working waterfall and colored liquid flows from it
It’s incredibly complex and incredibly lame

DAVE (cont’d)
Centerpoint proudly presents the
flowing Juicerfall

(pause for effect)
Cool crisp scintillating Who
can resist

GAINES
What the hell is that

DAVE
It’s the Just Juicerfall

GAINES
That is the most retarded thing I
have ever seen

WHITMAN
Um can we kill the music

Someone stops the boom box Gaines walks up to the
Juicerfall

GAINES
It looks dangerous

DAVE
No no it’s just fine

Dave smacks it to demonstrate that it’s fine and it
completely collapses Fake Juice dumps all over the floor

DAVE (cont’d)
Shit
Whitman glares at Dave
out the door

GAINES
Damn

Everyone gets out of the way

BRENNEMAN

I think it’s dissolving the carpet
DAVE

Oh god
WHITMAN

Alright that’s it Presentation
over

DAVE
But wait there’s more

GAINES
I’ve seen enough

DAVE
(scrambling)
But if you turn to appendix c in
your packet you’ll see we also
have Extreme Juice Power Stations

GAINES
I don’t care

DAVE
Mr Super-Juice Guy

GAINES
Isn’t there another team

DAVE
(desperate)
Brenneman sing him a song parody

Brenneman starts snapping his fingers about to sing

GAINES
Oh for the love of god

WHITMAN
Alright that’s enough Palmer
let’s get you some coffee while
Dave and his team clean this up

He quickly leads Palmer and his team

INT CENTERPOINT OFFICES HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Dave’s group stands outside the conference room They finish
dumping the remains of the Juicerfall in the trash A few
pull off rubber gloves Behind them we see Cutter’s team in
the conference room having their meeting

Dave faces his team

DAVE
I hope you’re happy I hope you’re
all happy

Dave seethes He’s clearly whacked out on pain pills and
looks like a lunatic with his acne and headgear

DAVE (cont’d)
That was a disaster in there Not
one of you knows the first thing
about making juice cool You’re
the least cool bunch of dorks
misfits and losers ever assembled

Dave starts pointing to them one by one

DAVE (cont’d)
You look what you’re wearing And
you have you ever even felt a
breast And you you live with
your mother Have any of you ever
been to a party Ever fit in
Ever done anything cool
Ever

Dave is beside himself Suddenly behind Dave the
conference room erupts into applause Dave turns to see the
doors open and Cutter Whitman and Gaines exit patting each
other on the back and laughing Dave tries to join in

DAVE (cont’d)
Hi fellas How’d it go

Gaines gives Dave a dirty look as he and his guys leave
INT WHITMAN’S OFFICE - LATER
Dave and Cutter sit across from Whitman

WHITMAN
Gaines made his decision

Cutter smiles Dave looks terrified

WHITMAN (cont’d)
We got the account
Cutter smiles bigger Dave is incredibly relieved

DAVE
Oh thank god

WHITMAN
No Dave thank Cutter Gaines as
you know was very disappointed
with your pitch And frankly so
was I Cutter really saved the
day

Whitman looks Dave up and down

WHITMAN (cont’d)
I don’t know what’s going on with
you The weak pitch the
inappropriate comments the
unseemly appearance and I’ve heard
that you berated your team Very
poor leadership

Dave sinks into his chair

WHITMAN (cont’d)
Cutter will be running the show on
Just Juice I’m promoting him to
Vice President of Creative Affairs

DAVE
What That was gonna be my job
He’s worked here for five minutes
I’ve been here for seven years

WHITMAN
After these last few weeks you’re
lucky to have a job Dave You’1ll
give logistical support to the
campaign and stay clear of Gaines
You’ll answer to Cutter

DAVE
(stunned)
But no I

WHITMAN

Let’s all be men about this okay
CUTTER

Don’t worry Noseplug I‘1ll put you

to work

Dave can’t believe this

INT CENTERPOINT OFFICES HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER
Dave covered in acne wearing headgear and looped on pain
meds trudges down the hall He looks like he’s been punched
in the gut then
BRENNEMAN
Hey Dave screw you and your
Juicerfall

Brenneman comes right up and PUNCHES Dave in the gut Dave
doubles over in pain

BRENNEMAN (contd)
We did our best

Brenneman walks away Dave slinks into his office
INT DAVE’S OFFICE

Dave enters and collapses onto his chair He catches his
breath and opens the pull-out shelf on his desk

He looks at his ‘life chart’ taped there Furious he grabs
it crumples it up and dumps it in the trash

He picks up his phone and dials a number
INT CLOTHING STORE - SAME

Jenny Cutter waits outside a dressing room She grabs the
ringing cell phone out of a nearby purse

DAVE
Well I need to talk to her

JENNY

Jenny hangs up

Dave is pissed He looks out his open office door and his
eyes go wide

Cutter and ARTURO are walking down the hall laughing
together Cutter actually has his arm around Arturo

ARTURO
Oh Mr Cutter you are a most
funny man

They continue down the hall Dave can’t believe it This is
the last straw

Dave grabs his phone and dials He waits and waits then
slams it down

DAVE
Damnit Mom where are you I need
you to pick me up

EXT STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

Dave walks along the side of an incredibly busy road He has
no car He’s walking home It begins to rain Hard Cars

Jesus Mom are you some kind of
chubby chaser

JUDY

LEAH’S VOICE
Hey Dave Jenny said you called

EXT DAVE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
Dave starts his car and drives off into the pouring rain
INT DAVE’S CAR

Rain pours down Dave drives like a man possessed

Lightning FLASHES and behind his headgear we see the rage
in Dave’s eyes

EXT EVENT SITE - NIGHT

Dave’s car screeches into the parking lot He gets out and
marches through the pouring rain

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT

Jenny Cutter Leah Whitman and a large group of Centerpoint
employees set up for the prom Music plays on a boom box as
everyone puts up elaborate tropical-themed decorations

Double doors fly open in the back of the room and Dave
stands there dripping wet and maniacal

Dave sizes up the happy group He sees Leah with Jenny and
Cutter He sees all the cool people from work

DAVE
Noooooo0co

All eyes go to Dave as he runs over to the boom box and
smashes it onto the ground

DAVE (cont’d)
(to Cutter)
You You ruined everything

Dave charges at Cutter full speed It’s unclear if he wants
to push him hit him or tackle him

When Dave gets there Cutter deftly uses his superior
strength to throw Dave down to the ground (think Pedro
Martinez and Don Zimmer)

As Whitman Leah and the others look on in disbelief Dave
makes another charge and is thrown down again

LEAH
Dave stop it What the hell is
wrong with you

DAVE
Wrong with me Wrong with me
Nothing is wrong with me It’s
him He’s the devil He dragged
us all back to high school - with
his popularity and his cool lunch
table and his prom I’m so sick of
this goddamn prom Fuck prom

Dave starts running around like a madman tearing down
decorations destroying elaborate palm trees made of papier-
mache The tropical paradise is being totalled

LEAH
Stop it Stop it

WHITMAN
Dave you are out of control This
is unacceptable

DAVE
You’re unacceptable All of you
are unacceptable Don’t you see
It’s all his fault

Dave points at Cutter

DAVE (cont’d)

He ruined my life He ruined the
plan He destroyed the office and
turned everyone against me

(to Whitman)
And you He’s got you wrapped
around his little finger You have
no say no power Cutter’s running
the whole thing

WHITMAN
That is it You’re fired Dave

DAVE

Dave stumbles and falls off the table

He gets back up and

storms out of the ballroom Leah is near tears

EXT PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Dave staggers out of the building in a rage Rain continues

to pour down Dave spots something

His eyes turn wild

There parked in the best parking spot in the whole lot is
Cutter’s sports car The vanity plate reads “Cutter”

Dave lunges for the car He kicks it and beats it with his
arms and fists The car alarm begins to BLARE but Dave
can’t seem to do any damage

Dave looks for something more powerful He sees a nearby
tree branch on the ground He grabs the branch

Dave wields the branch as if it was a crow bar and thrashes
at the car with it He hits windows doors even headlights
but nothing breaks Nothing even dents

The alarm continues to BLARE and in the building doorway
the group gathers Cutter Jenny Leah Whitman and others
all watch as Dave attempts to destroy Cutter’s car

Dave’s blows are futile The tree branch breaks It’s
pathetic Dave now beats at the car with the two pieces of
branch Leah can barely watch

Suddenly SIRENS BLARE and three cop cars pull into the lot
and surround Dave

OFFICERS jump out of their squad cars with guns drawn
POLICE OFFICER
You put down the weapons and get
on the ground Now

Dave continues to beat at the car

POLICE OFFICER (cont’d)
Go Go Go

In a perfectly choreographed maneuver the six cops charge at
Dave disarm him and tackle him to the ground They push his
face into the asphalt and drive their knees into his back

Leah watches in tears Jenny puts her arm around her as the
cops shove Dave into a squad car and slam the door

defeated A police officer approaches

A SUPER SLEEK HELICOPTER

Descends through the dawn sky The rotors create swirling
wind as the corporate chopper lands on the police helipad

The bay door of the helicopter opens and out steps SIMON
WALDRON Dave’s best high school friend He looks older and
wealthier but he’s still basically the same geek from his
high school days

DAVE (contd)
There’s no karma There’s no
justice cCutter’s still popular

INT BALLROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Leah Jenny Cutter and Affleck make their way toward the
ballroom Leah looks incredible in the dress
LEAH
I don’t know about this

JENNY
c’mon

Jenny drags Leah into
INT BALLROOM

Leah looks around in awe The place is truly a tropical
paradise Or at least the papier-mache version of one Leah
can’t believe it The destroyed decorations have not only
been rebuilt but expanded upon ten fold

LEAH
Who did all this

Cutter and Jenny just shrug Leah continues into the room
The place really looks great and everyone seems to be having
a good time Guests in tuxes and prom dresses complete with
boutonnieres and corsages dance and have fun

Everyone from work shmoozes and dances - Cutter’s team with
Dave’s team lowly Anwar with gorgeous Gina the softball
interns Arturo even Brenneman

The song ends and Whitman steps up to a microphone on stage

WHITMAN
Good evening everyone I’d like
to thank you all for helping
support Centerpoint’s commitment to
the Einler Cancer Research Center
This prom has been a rousing
success

Everyone applauds

WHITMAN (contd)
Now let me hand it over to our own
big man on campus Brad Cutter

People cheer wildly as Cutter steps to the microphone

CUTTER
Does this prom rock or what

Big cheer

CUTTER (cont’d)

Alright cool cool Before we
crown the king and queen of the
prom I’d like to bring someone
else up here He’s a guy you all
know He’s been through a lot
lately and he’s put a lot of you
through it too

Leah looks nervous

CUTTER (cont’d)
But he did manage to replace all
the decorations that he ruined And
he wants a chance to apologize
Please hear him out Ladies and
gentlemen Dave Fischman

Cutter turns and out from the wings steps Dave The
audience reacts coldly

Dave steps up to the microphone He looks like a complete
dork He has a tux on with a powder blue cumberbund and tie
to match Leah’s dress he wears his old headgear and he’s
actually wearing nose plugs He holds a cardboard box

In the crowd Leah looks like she wants to leave but Jenny
pulls her back

DAVE
(nervous)
Hi Everyone

People glare

DAVE (cont’d)
Look I know that a lot of you are
angry at me And you have good
reason I was a jackass

Anwar nods in agreement

DAVE (cont’d)
I insulted and offended my
hardworking team and I am so sorry
for that You worked your butts
off and you didn’t deserve it

A few members of Dave’s team soften

DAVE (cont’d)
I was a terrible leader I let you
down not the other way around I
was obsessed with being something
I’m not Something I could never
be But here I am tonight and
this is me

Dave lets everyone gaze at his full dorkitude

DAVE (cont’d)
I’m a geek I’ma dork I don’t
say the right things I don’t wear
the right clothes I don’t have a
way with people I’m not slick
I’m Noseplug I see that now I
was stupid to try to change

Leah listens intently

DAVE (cont’d)
I wanted to be Brad Cutter I’ve
actually wanted to be Brad Cutter
my whole life But I can’t I
need to just be me I see that
now but maybe it’s too late I
lost my job I lost your respect I
lost my dignity

Dave takes the microphone off its stand and heads down into
the crowd

DAVE (cont’d)
But the worst part is I lost the
only woman who ever loved me for
me

Dave makes his way toward the back of the room He scans
for Leah

DAVE (cont’d)
I judged her so quickly and so
wrongly I accused her of being
shallow and stuck in the past when
that is exactly what I was doing

The crowd parts and Dave finds himself looking across the
room at Leah

DAVE (cont’d)
Leah this is the prom I never had
and now I know it’s the prom that
you never had too I was too busy
being a jerk to see how much it
meant to you and I’m so sorry
But I want to make it up to you
Maestro

The DJ hits play and the karaoke track for “Hold On To The
Nights” kicks in Dave starts to sing

DAVE (cont’d)

Well I think that Ive been true
to everybody else but me And the
way I feel about you makes my heart
long to be free Every time I look
into your eyes Im helplessly
aware That the someone Ive been
searching for is right there

Dave continues as he walks right up to Leah She can’t help
but smile warmly - truly touched by the gesture

DAVE (cont’d)
Hold on to the nights Hold on to
the memories I wish that I could
give you more

LEAH
(choked up)
You are such a dork

Dave looks Leah right in the eyes

DAVE
I was gonna do this properly with
a ring and everything but Ben
Affleck won my ring money

Affleck shrugs Dave gets down on one knee and looks up at
Leah He opens the box to reveal a corsage

DAVE (cont’d)
Leah will you go to prom with me
and marry me

Leah looks shocked and happy She takes a breath then

LEAH
(quietly overwhelmed)
Yes

DAVE
Even if I’m never cool

LEAH
As long as you never try to be

DAVE
Never

He slides the corsage on her wrist and they embrace
Everyone cheers Dave and Leah kiss People cheer more

Reveal Dave’s mom Judy and Len stepping out of the crowd
and cheering Also reveal Simon and Kara there applauding
Arturo weeps openly

Dave and Leah kiss and hold each other Neither has ever
looked happier Cutter steps up

CUTTER
Ladies and gentleman I give you
the king and queen of the prom

Cutter walks right up to Dave and Leah and puts the crowns
on their heads Perfect

The DJ kicks on an awesome fun rocking song and as the
credits roll we begin a killer dance montage

Len and Judy cut a rug Affleck break dances Cutter and
Jenny rip it up Anwar gets funky Kara and Simon let loose
and of course Dave dances with Leah like the dork he is
FADE OUT

over his head reads - Just Juice - Just Cool

A CUSTOMER pushes his cart along He stops and stares at the
standee

CUSTOMER
