Final Draft
IN BLACK

We hear a mans bellow followed by a great resonating thud

FADE UP FROM BLACK

INT EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

A PAIR OF HANDS

Large and very powerful they move into frame palms up and

we follow them until they stop directly over a small lavatory
sink

The spigot is activated by a foot pedal

One hand squeezes a green bottle of Phisohex soap

A stream of soap hits the other hand in slow motion

The huge hands come together and lather the soap We hear
tuneless humming

We follow the hands into the stream of running water for a
rinse

AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

She sits in another corner waiting patiently clad in a
backless hospital gown Around her neck is a chrome steel
brace

An adjustable couch is immediately in front of her

We hear the water being shut off The humming continues
Footsteps approach The humming stops

VOICE
Morning

The woman looks up with a nervous smile

THE HANDS

They bring in a paper towel and towel themselves dry
A TRASH CAN

A foot hits its pedal to open it and the wadded towel is
tossed in

THE WOMAN

The footsteps resume and her look climbs as the man
approaches His back enters frame eclipsing our view

CLOSE ON THE WOMAN

Her look continues to climb as the big mans shadow slides up
her face In her glistening eyes we see the man approaching
hands out fingers spread

The woman starts to tremble Her movement is restricted by
her neck brace so that her eyes roll to the top of their
sockets as she tracks the oncoming figure

EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF A SCREWDRIVER BLADE

The glimmering blade enters to fill the screen

We follow it over to the head of a knurled screw It clicks
into the slot and--CREAK CREAK CREAK--starts to loosen

OPPOSING SCREW
The blade enters and--CREAK CREAK CREAK--loosens it
THE WOMANS NECK
Her brace is carefully removed to reveal a long vulnerable
neck Her hair is loosely pinned a few strands wafting in
the breeze
The huge hands enter and strategically close over the neck at
the base of the skull and around the throat They ease the
head into a circular movement The woman becomes limp
leaving the hands total control of her movement
VOICE

Minmm Hmmm Just relax now Yes On

the couch face down please
THE COUCH

The woman enters and gently falls to rest face down her nose
nestling in the breathing crack

HAND PEGS

A shot of each of the hand pegs on either side of the couch
as each of her hands drops in to clutch it

THE WOMANS BACK

The mans muscular back enters and he reaches down to gently
place his hands on the womans legs He aligns them and
humming again runs his hands along them feeling each joint
WOMANS FACE

Apprehensive her eyes roll sideways in a vain attempt to see
whats going on

HER BACK

The hands enter in a butterfly pattern thumbs touching we
follow the hands as they dive to the top of her buttocks on
contact the thumbs probe deep into the vertebrae

HER FACE

Her eyes widen

WOMAN
Ooohh

THE HANDS

They probe her spine expertly groping with both thumbs and
all fingers

WOMANS FACE

Her eyes drop She relaxes

HER HANDS

They relax on the pegs

MANS TORSO

The man is drawing a deep breath his chest swells and his
elbows lock as the muscles leap out in his arms The man
suddenly draws back

WOMAN

Totally relaxed now a smile creeps into place

HER BACK

As the hands come crashing down onto her lower lumbar

We hear the slap of flesh and the stress sounds of stretching

tissue

WOMANS FACE

She is driven down into the cushion and her eyes fly open as
the wind is knocked out of her

WOMAN
OQ00co0ch

THE MAN

He locks his elbows once again
He drives down again and again applying his weight and his
strength to the womans body CRUNCH SLAP CRUNCH SLAP

WOMAN
OO0OOWOOOOOCCOCOOF FF

The woman forced again and again into the cushion gasps as
if drowning

The adjustment stops The woman finally opens her eyes and
swallows air Sweat now stands out on her brow but she is
regaining her composure
A beat of relief
The hands reenter to CRUNCH the base of her neck

» NNNGGAPFFF

The mans voice is still soothing gentle

VOICE
On your side facing me

The woman starts to roll

THE HANDS

They hover palms down fingers spread as if warming over a
fire With the whine of a compressor the S of the womans
side hums up into frame to meet the waiting hands

The hands gently feel squeeze and adjust until the correct
position is found A motionless moment

THE WOMANS FACE

She waits in suspense looking straight ahead

OVERHEAD

The broad-shouldered man abruptly pushes with his right arm

and pulls with his left the one clean movement sharply
twisting the woman We hear a succession of snaps and pops

THE WOMAN

Reacting stunned but not hurt

WOMAN
AAAaahh
VOICE
On your back facing me please

She complies
Her breathing again slows to normal and her eyeballs roll up
as a powerfully muscled arm enters to slide down her face

Her eyes move to follow it The hand snakes around her chin
and stops with the hand firmly clasping her cheek bone

The hand pauses for just a beat makes a slight adjustment in
the attitude of the head pauses again

The other hand enters to slide across her face her eyes
again following This hand comes to rest on the top vertebra
under her ear

BEHIND HER EAR

Extremely close on the thumb probing her skull and massaging
the vertebra until it appears that top vertebra and skull
have been disconnected

WOMANS FACE

The powerful arms cradle and swivel the head The thumb
Massages behind the ear The head rolls as if detached from
her body and supported only by the mans hands

She is totally relaxed Her eyes roll up

HER POV

An eye chart on the opposite wall It is blurry and gently
rocks back and forth as her head is manipulated

The rocking stops A pause

A short sharp twist--and we hear a bone snap
With the snap the eye chart racks halfway to focus

A little more rocking A pause

Twist back--a second snap--and the eye chart racks to pin
sharp

A head now enters from the top of the frame smiling down at
her He is a young man with square-jawed good looks

He is Edward Bliss

ED
(still upside-down)
About five more visits and that oughta do
it
THE WOMAN
She swings her feet out to sit up She is radiant now a new

person A lock of hair droops over her forehead and wafts in
the breeze

The man whom we now see whole for the first time is very
powerfully built

ED
You can put the brace away but dont get
rid of it just in case Oh by the way--
Ill be at this address from now on

He is handing her a business card

oo Im starting my own practice in

Harper City
The card identifying “Edward Bliss Jr DC bears the
image from the Sistine Chapel of Gods hand reaching to
Adams

Its only an hour away

The woman glances at the card smiles at Ed

WOMAN
I‘dont care how far it is

INT EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER

SOMEONE ELSES POV

We hold for a beat on the wall of an examining room

With a loud pop we abruptly tilt down to look at the floor
Stretching away from us are the hospital-gowned legs of a
seated middle-aged woman

A mans hand reaches in from the side showing the familiar
business card to the lens

ED
Moving to a new office Dotty

OBJECTIVE SHOT

Dotty the middle-aged woman is seated in a chiropractors
chair head being angled down toward the floor by a half-
nelson applied by Edward Bliss who squats behind her His
free hand is showing her the card

DOTTY
Oh yeah

INT EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER
SOMEONE ELSES POV

Ed looms up toward the right rather blurry His hands are
extended down toward either side of the lens

With a loud pop the hands twist and the image spins a full
120 degrees so that Ed now lists off in another orientation
Now he is perfectly sharp He fishes in his pocket

ED
New office address Mr Renfrew

REVERSE

On Mr Renfrew reaching up to give the back of his neck an
appreciative rub

MR RENFREW
Wherever

INT CLINIC HALLWAY - DAY

We pull Ed as he walks down the hall humming Another
doctor in a white smock pursues bellowing

DOCTOR POLAND
Bliss Bliss

He is Doctor Peter Poland Ed turns to face him and Poland
thrusts one of the business cards in his face The card
cupped in his hand is upside-down showing Gods and Adams
hands palms-up

Poland splutters
Wuddya call this

ED
Upside-down

Poland swivels his hand down to look at the card himself and
sees that it is--right-side-up He frowns

POLAND
Wuddya talkin’ about

ED
T11 tell you what Im talking about
When I started for you as an intern you
promised me raises if I was kept on-

POLAND
Bullshit yYou’re talkin’ through your
ass Bliss

ED
All right then buster my ass says this
Ive got a family to think about now I
cant keep doing all the work here for
none of the money And since I just got
my own DC as of Monday Ill be in
business for myself Naturally Id be
grateful for any referrals you could give
me but I suspect youre about to run out
of patients I know I have

He turns and walks on down the corridor Poland calls after
him

POLAND
Very funny Bliss Har-har-har Well it
wont beso funny when you fall flat on
yer keister Youll be needin help with
subluxation then Ya musclebound goody-
goody Go ahead--see how ya like it with
no Peter Poland lookin out for ya On
your ass Bliss Flat on your goddamn
goody-goody ass

We are pulltng away from the doctor a white-smocked figure
in a white corridor The white-on-white pullback is snapped
off by a shock cut to black the imprecations continue to
echo off the tiles as we are in

INT BLACK LIMBO

After a beat a body--a large body--rises in slow motion into
the blackness We hear Peter Poland’s echoing voice “On
your ass Bliss” Arms flailing the man spins slowly up and
away He seems naked--or strangely more than naked we see
exposed muscle tissue bones spinal column

In fact he looks like an anatomy classs Visible Man He is
wearing a leotard which depicts the human skeleton and
muscular system peeled away on one side of the chest to show
internal organs A green fig leaf is sewn over the leotards

genital area The outfits mask shows a skull through the
nose-hole of which the wearers nose protrudes and large eye-
sockets through which his eyes peer Out of the rictus mouth
comes a slowed-down semi-human ROAR Echoing under it “On
your ass Bliss”

We tilt up to follow his airborne slow-motion trajectory
The tilt brings us out of blackness to put the spinning body
against a high bay light

The body starts to descend still roaring arms still
flailing “On your ass Bliss”

INT WRESTLING RING - NIGHT

Our pan down with it brings it past three horizontal ropes
The body finally slams into a harshly toplit canvas

NAKED MAN
HUHNGH

He groggily shakes his head Peter Poland’s voice is gone
A swishing rustle draws his attention

HIS POV

The dutch-angle also slow motion shows another wrestler
charging across the ring toward us arms pumping This man
is naked except for the grass skirt of the Pacific islander
which slowly swishes as he runs His body is huge his
features broad and flat

SAMOAN
AAAAHHHHHH
NAKED MAN
ws (His eyes widen)
Hunh

HIS POV

The Samoan leaves his feet--leaping--arms and legs
spreadeagled--flying at us

THE NAKED MAN

His eyes track the approaching Samoan performing his flying
angel His shadow slips up the Naked Mans face

NAKED MANS POV

The flying Samoan is descending spreadeagled toward us
backlit by the high bay light

SAMOAN
AAAAHHHHHH

His chest fills the frame
THOOOMP

BLACKNESS

THE CROWD

The audience roars in slow motion--a sea of faces twisted by
the ancient lust for action

THE RING

Begin normal motion Beneath his foe the Naked Man wriggles
like a pinned insect

NAKED MANS FEET

He lifts and then stamps down his feet to start a “crack-the-
whip wave that travels up his body

When the wave reaches his shoulders the Samoan is thrown
clear with the loud rustle of esparto grass

SAMOAN
Huh

The Naked Man scrambles to his feet and grabs one of the
Samoans arms He starts spinning him taking small mincing
steps as he rotates in place forcing the Samoan into a
flatfooted but accelerating orbit around him

Once he hasgenerated sufficient velocity he releases the
Samoan who hurtles helplessly toward the ropes

The Samoan bounces off the ropes and hurtles back toward the
Naked Man in the center of the ring grass rustling

NAKED MAN
Hah

He gracefully sidesteps so that the Samoan stumbles on by
toward the opposite ropes

Oddly the Naked Man now kneels in the center of the ring and
draws himself into a ball

The Samoan bounces off the opposing ropes and approaches

center ring again arms now outstretched and ready for
action

ll

SAMOAN
AAAAHHHHH

When the evil wrestler reaches him our wrestler performs a
Bouncing Betty exploding up and launching a fist through
the other mans grass skirt into his crotch

NAKED MAN
HAH

SAMOAN
NNGGGAIAIEE

The Samoan hunches over and duckwalks around the ring in
agony

The Naked Man slips behind him presses a palm against each
of his ears and performs a Charles Atlas squeezing in

SAMOAN
AAAaagggh--HUH

The Charles Atlas has been punctuated by a rabbit punch Now
the Naked Man steps around in front of his Opponent and grabs
his nose He waves his arm Sinuously back and forth and the
Samoans nose follows

SAMOAN
Hnnnggggeeennnggg

The Naked Man ends this Water Buffalo with a sharp
releasing snap of his wrist

NAKED MAN
Hah

The Samoans head bobs with aftershocks he is dazed

SAMOAN
Whuhuh

A backhand from the Naked Man sends him down onto the canvas
The Naked Man flops on top of him pinning him
The Samoan murmurs

SAMOAN
Happy birthday

The ref slaps the canvas three times and the fall is over

The crowd roars

INT BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

The Naked Man is peeling his mask off as passers-by slap him
on the back

OTHER WRESTLERS
Happy birthday happy thirtieth pal
- Good bout Happy birthday Eddie

As he finishes taking off his mask we see that it is indeed

his wife Kim She kisses him on the cheek

them walk away into the long dark exit tunnel

SAMMY
Youll come crawlin back Eddie Bliss I know you--the

wrasslin’ game is in your blood You need that contact--skin
on skin Your pretty little wife cant give you that

As the voice echoes out Ed and Kim are receding out of the
last of the tunnels light leaving us in

INT BLACK LIMBO

Ed naked falls in slow motion through the blackness
Sammy’s voice still echoes “In your blood Bliss’

Once Ed has disappeared below frame a toplit youth
Materializes far away running directly toward us He wears
a leather jacket has long sideburns and a ducks ass
haircut and all the earmarks of a classic fifties bully

He rushes at us through the black limbo

CUT TO REVERSE OF
EXT PLAYGROUND - DAY

old Eddie Bliss We are no longer in limbo but on a school
playground and Sammys voice is gone

He reaches to give Eddie a hand up
A little girl watching wide-eyed turns and runs off

The bully yanks Eddie to his feet and whips him into the
chest of another bully

SECOND BULLY
Hey--watch where youre going dickwad

He shoves Eddie to the ground
At the opposite end of the yard the little girl has run up to
aman in a blue windbreaker wearing a whistle around his neck-

MATCH CUT TO
INT BLACK LIMBO 10

classic wrestling pose fades up behind falling Ed By the
time falling Ed reaches the bottom of the frame the image is
fully up
INT SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY 11

The image flips toward us--it is a page in a book The next
page also pictures a classically posed wrestler

A jump back shows that young Eddie Bliss is intently looking
through a wrestling book in the school library

The sound of a roaring crowd fades up

INT GYMNASIUM - DAY 12

Wrestling mats are out on the floor A crowd of boys in gym
attire surround one mat They are roaring their faces
twisted in the ancient lust for action

On the mat young Eddie has pinned one of the bullies face-
down and is twisting his arm behind him The bullys face is
contorted with agony

We hear the bone snap

The crowd roars Bully Two rushes out at Eddie who takes
him down with an accomplished leg-hook and starts twisting
his arm

At the sound of a whistle he looks up

yank

INT HALLWAY - DAY 14

pharmacist not a hooligan--and someday

LITTLE EDDIE

MR BLISS
Pharmacist Pharmacist Pharmacist

Little Eddies head flops about beneath the violent shakes of
the enraged apothecary

As he screams Pharmacist we track into Ed Seniors mouth
until we are interior to it--in black

INT BLACK LIMBO 15
Caplets tablets and capsules drift down through the black
Also floating down is the adult Ed gazing about in

wonderment at the slow-motion rain of pharmaceuticals

A KALAIDOSCOPE 16

Spinning images of growing Eddie engaged in pursuits both
pugilistic and pharmacological

Playing under it is a sound collage of three echoing voices
becoming more and more insistent “On your ass Bliss” “In
your blood Bliss” ‘Pharmacist Pharmacist Pharmacist”
Ed carefully grinds something in a pestle

A He pins various opponents to the mat in his high school
wrestling club

apothecarys scale as his smiling father stands behind him
and pats him on the back

back in a swan-dive posture

“On your ass Bliss” “In your blood Bliss “Pharmacist

Ed reaches up and grabs his opponents head one hand on
either side A couple of small exploratory turns and then

SNAP--he gives a sudden adjustment

His opponent roars and rolls off

Both men scramble to their feet and perform the immemorial
pro wrestlers dance as they face each other with chests
thrust out they hop-skip around the ring running their
thumbs under the waistbands of their trunks and then snapping
them free

CLOSE ON HER KNEE

Eddie puts a hand on it tenderly massages it His fingers
stretch up her thigh and then his hand starts to slide up
under her dress

The camera is looking up her dress and follows the hand as it
slides up It is dark under her dress

We are lost in blackness

INT BLACK LIMBO 37

We hear a whistle very distant dripping with reverb

Far away in the blackness a figure emerges into toplight
very small very distant he is running toward us in slow
motion

It is Mr Connigliaro the phys ed teacher

He runs toward us arms pumping cheeks distended around his
whistle As usual in spite of his furious effort he makes

little forward progress his motion slowed by the frame rate
and the long lens

The whistle starts to fade as does his image til we are
once again in quiet and in

INT STICKS CAR - NIGHT 40

This driver too is pulling out of an evasive swerve but much
less energetically--he drives with one pinky on the power

INT BLISS PHARMACY - MORNING 41
Behind the pharmacy counter in his drug store Ed Bliss Senior
is pouring capsules into a funnel to fill a row of small
bottles lined up on the counter White hair and Giapetto-
like half-glasses have softened his formerly stern look
We hear the tinkle of the bell over the door
We hear a woman gasp and then a male voice

MAN
AAAAAAHHHHH

Mr Bliss looks up From behind his pharmaceutical counter
he has no view of the store

We hear the female voice

28
41
WOMAN
AAAAAAHHHHH

Mr Bliss rises jaw hanging slack and warily approaches the
end of the pharmaceutical counter

ON MR BLISS

He rounds the pharmaceutical counter still holding the jug
of capsules

VOICES
AAAAAAAHHHHHH

He stares and drops the jug

The capsules bounce and scatter across the floor

HIS POV

Someone is bear-hugging Mrs Bliss her feet up off the
floor kicking as both she and the hugger continue to bellow
with joy A pregnant woman stands to one side beaming

With the clatter of the dropped jug Mrs Bliss interrupts
her kicking and shouting to look around

So too does the hugger Ed Junior

All stand frozen Ed Junior leaned back with his mother still
clasped to his chest both of their faces turned to look

Slowly Mrs Bliss sinks back to the floor her broad smile
fading So does Ed Junior’s His arms unwrap from around
her

Ed and his ‘father stare at each other

Mrs Bliss looks worriedly from father to son

Mr Bliss lurches forward He walks zombielike toward his
son capsules crunching to powder underfoot

MRS BLISS
(apprehensively)
Our little boy has come back to us
Edward

Mr Bliss stands swaying staring up at his strapping son
ED

Im back to stay Dad I hope thats all
right 41

Mr Bliss stares Finally
MR BLISS
Son you stay as long as you
like
Ed beams
Mrs Bliss beams
Kim beams
Ed puts his arms around his father and hugs him tight

MR BLISSS FEET

They dangle off the floor The odd capsule or two lodged in
a shoe tread now falls out and bounces on the floor

MR BLISS OVER EDS SHOULDER

Struggling to smile under the compressive force of his sons
bear hug

Finally Ed sets him down and Mr Bliss draws a great long-
deferred breath

Ed is too excited to notice

ED
Look Dad This is my best gal Kim
Sorry Ma--second-best gal

Kim is blushing

KIM
Hi Dad

ED
And this

He grabs his fathers hand and places it on Kims stomach

ED
This is your grandson

All look at Mr Bliss who looks in stupefaction at his own
hand resting on Kims swollen belly

ED
What do you think Dad

Mr Bliss continues to stare at his own hand on the belly
Then he looks up jaw hanging open at the three waiting
faces beaming down at him He looks dumbly from one to the
other

He bursts into tears
He cups his hands over his glasses and sobs loudly
Ed hugs him this time more tenderly

ED
- Oh Dad Oh Dad

Mrs Bliss and Kim smile and sniffle as Mr Bliss continues
to give great hooting sobs

INT BLISS PHARMACY - LATER

waxing enthusiastic

He looks into the dead eyes behind the tinted aviator glasses
as his strong hands probe appraisingly at the mans
shoulders

ED
If I uh misaligned any vertebrae
or the sudden tensing on impact knotted
any of your muscles feel free to call me
for a complimentary office visit

As he hands one of his business cards to the oddly passive
man his attention is drawn by the sound of approaching
clanks

Sticks Verona is walking toward us He walks with the help
of two orthopoedic walker-canes and wears heavy leg braces
that keep his knees locked His body herky-jerks along and
his stiff twisted back swings wildly with each step like the
mast of a ship in a heaving sea

ED
And if your uh friend uh needs

does give him a directive out of the side of his mouth

ON THE SHOULDER

The officer leads the quiescent Ed to his parked squad car
where his partner waits leaning against the hood The young
cop looks at Eds dulled eyes

He is handing Ed a breathalyzer bag Ed takes it gives it a

stupefied look fills his mighty lungs and then blows into it-
BANG--and the bag explodes 54

He hands the blown bag back to the officer

BURGLAR
AAAAHHHH- -huh

The Burglar looks back puzzled as Ed finishes clambering
through the ropes and rushes in toward him

EDS POV RUSHING IN AT BURGLAR

The Burglars arms are relaxed at his sides and his masked
eyes look innocently into the advancing lens as he mildly
puts in

BURGLAR

backflips on the way down and lands on his face

The crowd roars

to give Knut Hamlensen a hand--the Naked
Man and the Viking are great friends of

He gives his partner a what-the-hell-is-going-on look but the
other announcer can only shrug and turn two palms up
However his on-air manner remains smooth

Well thats absolutely right Dale last
Easter the Naked Man sent Knut a crate of
raw herring which as you know is all
the Viking eats--

ANNOUNCER ONE
I believe he also eats wild berries
Marty

THE RING

The Viking scrambles to his feet and roaring performs an
atomic knee-drop on the Burglars back The Burglar gives a
huge reaction As Ed squats by the Burglar and begins
bending one arm behind his back the Viking interrupts his
own roar to hiss
VIKING
Ed what the hellre you doin

Ed keeps applying pressure to the Burglars bent-back arm
until he wear a pop and the snapping of tendons The
Burglars scream is real

The crowd roars

The Viking holds his other hand aloft The crowd cheers

Ed yanks one hand free of the ref and uses both hands to flip
the Viking

The crowd stunned is suddenly quiet 56

Ed grabs the prone Vikings foot with both hands and gives it
a violent twist Snap He holds it bent wrong-way-round for

‘a moment and then twists it quickly back Snap--crunch--

great friends have had some kind of
falling out

for the corner of the ring

As he climbs the turnbuckle the crowd remains silent

SAMMY

He watches jaw clamped on a cigar registering the quiet
descended on the arena broken only by the wounded Vikings
blubbering He murmurs

SAMMY
Iv dont think they like it

THE RING

Atop the turnbuckle Ed lifts the screaming Viking high over
his head

He pile-drives him down into the canvas

As the Vikings head rips through the canvas his screaming
abruptly stops

He is a headless body surreally planted upside-down in the
ring His legs futilely scissor and kick

The crowd roars 56

He nods relief

SAMMY
Nah they like it

spin the ref The refs body and outflung arms start to rise
like a whirlygig

The ref is in wind-whistling centrifugal spin His teeth are
bared and his face is stretched and twisted by the g-force

Ed finally releases

The ref flies off off and up out of the cone of downlight
and into the black of the stands
The crowd screams approval

INT BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE TUNNEL - NIGHT 57

We are looking dead-on at the tunnel entrance ramp from which
fighters emerge into the arena And fighters are indeed
emerging

In slow motion they run directly at us all of Sammys Big-
Time wrestlers in all their various costumes a Mountain Man
an Eskimo a Fireman an Arab a Roman centurion a
Rastafarian an Indian Chief an Astronaut Mr Mystery in a
leotard bearing a big question mark Large Marge the apron-
wearing housewife waving a rolling pin etc

INT WRESTING RING MONTAGE 58

In slow motion Ed Bliss subdues the swarming comers with
adjustments two-handed head twists flips bear hugs face
grab-and-twists etc

The crowd gripped by the ancient lust for action roars
approval

The montage ends with a slow-motion pan--the kind that
traditionally ends a depiction of the Battle of the Boyne or
Culloden or say Bull Run This one shows a canvas littered
with twisted bodies--some inert some still writhing in slow-
motion agony all in different attitudes of defeat The pan
finds the feet of the one man left standing--Ed Bliss--and we
tilt up to see that he is waving reel-it-down circles with
one finger

INT WRESTLING RING - NIGHT 59

LOOKING STRAIGHT UP

We are looking up into blackness cut by one diagonal dusty
shaft of light

After a moment a microphone obediently descends into the
shaft of light and approaches in slow motion

WIDE

Normal motion as the cord-suspended mike finally reaches Ed
and he grabs it and waits for sufficient slack to talk into
it comfortably

The roaring crowd finally quiets and after a brief high-
pitched surge of feedback there is complete silence brought
home by one echoing cough from the stands

ED
» Hello I would like to thank you
all for coming today to hear my thoughts

A few encouraging cheers
Many evils plague modern society
As you have just seen no race no creed
no profession is immune I once thought
I could fight this evil within the
confines of the examining room--and the
ring

Some cheers

This was a grave error There can
be no out-of-bounds in the fight against
malefaction In a world where vice is
manifold and human misery multiform
right must go forth Therefore I
have decided to walk among you

Some cheers

Yes you have seen the many faces
of the evil that men do But what is its
one root cause What is the single great
wrong that poisons human intercourse I
think you all know that it is
spinosacral misalignment We draw our
being for good or ill from our neuro-
skeletal center Man is born whole and
is everywhere treated in pieces The
medical doctor the druggist all those
who puncture the skin they would treat
the parts of man Man is not in the
Parts Man is true Man is straight
Man is whole And that is why I shall
walk among you

Walk among you What walk among you
Hit somebody

over his eyes as he talks He has a days worth of stubble

and the Classically filthy apartment of the self-loathing man
who lives alone

Koski Yeah Yeah Right
Greco-Roman or Pro Right Yup

He hangs up

He pushes back his hat revealing deeply bagged eyes swings
out his wingtip-shod feet and sits up It appears that
before bedding down the only concession he made to comfort
was to take off his tie and unbutton his top shirt button
He now takes the tie from the bedpost where it hangs and
slipknots it back onto his neck He gives one armpit a
cursory sniff

On it are the remains of last nights pizza a nearly-empty
bottle of whiskey and an amber-puddled tumbler among many
dirty dishes We are shooting across the counter and see
Koski chest and down as he stumbles in

He runs some water into a kettle and puts the kettle on the
electric range He shakes out the whiskey tumbler over the
floor and runs some water into it He takes a bottle of
aspirin and shakes a good half-dozen into one hand tosses
them back tosses the water back

He unscrews a jar of freeze-dried coffee He takes a spoon
from a bowl among the dirty dishes and shakes it dry over the
floor He scoops out a heaping teaspoon of coffee and dumps
it into a mug He flips the damp spoon now coated with
coffee crystals into the sink

He taps the kettle cautiously with one finger and then rests
the finger on the metal still cold

He drums his fingers on the countertop

He picks up a can of air-freshener and gives the kitchen a
once-over He puts the air-freshener down He picks it up
again and sprays his armpits

He cautiously taps the kettle again and again lets his finger
rest against it the water is still not warm

He drums his fingers

He picks up the coffee mug and tips it and shakes out the
coffee crystals back and forth over a slice of cold pizza
He picks up the slice of pizza

As he talks Burns consults a small spiral notebook

BURNS
The perp is named Edward Bliss Jr
Apparently earlier this evening he also
jaywalked and inflicted universal sprains
on the two officers attempting arrest
He handcuffed them together in an
anatomically improbable configuration
pilfered one of their hats and fled
Hes a white caucasian six-foot-two and
last seen wearing a body-stocking
depicting the human skeleto-muscular
system

KOSKI
Right

BURNS
There were about seven thousand witnesses
here so well be taking statements for a
while but in the meantime Ive put his
description out on the wire Funny
thing everybody says that after he
manhandled these joes he made some kind
of speech but nobody agrees on what it
was about Some say it dealt with good
posture and sitting up straight some say
it was about good and evil some say he
was advocating nudism

KOSKI
Uh-huh

BURNS
A lot of people thought it was a gag
some were moved and quite a few were
bored silly

KOSKI
Huh

BURNS
Well thats about it for now

He flips the notebook shut

EXT BIKER BAR - NIGHT 63

A huge-leather clad biker pulls his hog up into the
foreground and dismounts In the background a neon sign over
the bar door glows HAWG HEAVEN

INT BIKER BAR - NIGHT 64

The bar is crowded with enormous bikers in black with the
occasional heavy glinting chain or stud There are also a
few cycle sluts--fat slatternly women with raucous smoke-
cured laughs

Ed enters in his Naked Man leotard His mask is rolled up to
ride on his head like a stocking cap He walks up to the
bar humming nonchalantly The bartender gives him the dead
eye

ED
Hello I need some way of getting around
town Do you suppose one of your
customers would mind if I borrowed his
motorcycle for a few days

The bartender stares
What am I asking you for I should
ask one of them youre the bartender
Bartender could I have some beer nuts
not too salty and a glass of water at
room temperature

A sneering smile curls the bartenders lips

BARTENDER
No skin no service

N ED
Oh no I have skin this is just a
painted leotard

BARTENDER
I know what it is Gutboy

ED
Please dont call me Gutboy

BARTENDER
Why not--Gutboy

Ed opens his mouth to reply but is interrupted

i

64

WOMANS VOICE
Hey arent you the guy from the
wrestling match

He turns to look

The woman is attractive as cycle sluts go In spite of her
wildly frizzy black hair nose ring navel ring and the
tattoo on one shoulder that says BEST BITCH she is young and
rather innocent-looking She is Dolores

She is nodding at Ed with a faint smile He is polite but
does not return her smile

ED
Why is he calling me Gutboy

DOLORES
Ah hes just a jerk I was at your bout
tonight That speech you gave man--that
was really deep What you said about the
spine man thats so true I hada
boyfriend once with a slipped disc and
god was he an asshole

She is joined by the bars biggest biker a man with a
Grizzly-Adams beard and a mammoth gut pushing at an enormous
silver belt buckle He holds a stein of beer and has a hand-
rolled cigarette in the corner of his mouth

BIKER
Whats the story with Gutboy

DOLORES
No hes cool Mountain He has this
thing figured out where if everybodys
back was okay then there wouldnt be so
much like negativity

BIKER
I dont get it

DOLORES
Mountain isnt into theories

ED
Let me tell you something else about
Mountain young lady I dont care
whether its tobacco or marijuana this

He plucks the cigarette from Mountains mouth

(MORE) 64
ED (contd)
- is not good for him And alcohol

He drops the cigarette into Mountains beer Mountain
watches with what looks like sad disinterest
is a progressive depressant which
will eventually destroy his liver unless
it engenders a fatal accident first

Dolores tugs at Eds sleeve and whispers

DOLORES
I wouldnt do that to Mountain

ED
Furthermore all this ventral weight

He lays a hand on the belly exposed by Mountains open vest
and vibrates it Mountain sadly watches
and the rest of this chickenfat

He likewise jiggles Mountains breasts and the fat of his
upper arms
- create load stresses that his
skeleton was not designed to accomodate
Nor was his heart

At the pool table one biker nudges another

BIKER
Hey lookathis Mountains about to rip
a guys head off

Back at the bar Ed plucks a bag of tobacco out of Mountains
vest pocket loosens its string and taps its contents into
Mountains beer as he continues

Nw ED

- Now I would recommend that Mountain
here adopt a regimen of aerobic
excercise a diet of fresh fruit and raw
or steamed vegetables

He slips the empty bag back into Mountains pocket and takes
a packet of rolling papers from the same pocket He rips it
open so that the papers flutter festively to the floor
- and a schedule of chiropractic

visits until he trims himself up and gets

all of his alignments squared away Then

Maybe Mountain will be ready to take his

place in civilized society

Mountain watches the last piece of rolling paper flit back
and forth and settle to the floor The paper takes its time 64

The entire bar has fallen silent A ring of observers has
formed

There is a long silence
At length Mountain clears his throat

MOUNTAIN
Ahem

He looks at the tobacco-beer cocktail he holds sadly sets it
on the bar

He climbs sadly off his stool and observers step back to make
room

He looks at Ed for a long beat then turns and walks away

Puzzled the crowd parts to let him pass He recedes toward
the back of the bar The clack of his bootheels is the only
sound in the bar

He reaches the abandoned pool table Large man though he is
Mountain is a small figure now in long shot framed by the
foreground bodies of the watching crowd

Mountain picks up one of the two cue sticks lying on the
table He gives it an appraising heft Not satisfied he
tries the other one This one apparently feels better

Heels clacking Mountain walks back toward the foreground
with the cue The circle reforms around him as he reaches
Ed Like the rest of the crowd Ed watches patiently

Mountain takes one measured step away from Ed and gripping
the cue by its slender end gently swings it until the fat
end just touches the side of Eds face Dissatisfied with
how the shot lines up Mountain steps forward gently places
one hand under Eds chin angles his head just so then steps
back again and takes another slow measuring swing

Perfect

Now every muscle in Mountains body tenses as he brings the
stick back for the big blow As he uncoils and brings the
cue stick around in a vicious air-splitting sweep Mountain
roars

MOUNTAIN
AAAAAAHHHHHHH

At the instant before impact--WHOOSH--a hand appears in front
of the target It is Eds hand WHAP--the cue stick slaps
into it 64

Ed gives his end of the cue a sharp twist It snaps leaving
a sawed-off slender piece in Mountains hand

Mountain gives his piece a stupid look

MOUNTAIN ©
Huh

ED
You know Mountain this could cause
severe cranio-spinal subluxation

WHOOSH-WHISH-WHOOSH--in sped-up motion Ed gives the cue stick
one-handed majorette twirls

Mountain watches mesmerized with jerky sped-up head
movements

WHACK--Ed slams Mountains left ear with the cue stick
Mountain raises his hand to his ear and screams

MOUNTAIN
AAAARAAHHHHHH

WHOOSH-WHISH-WHOOSH--more nun-chuk twirls WHACK--Ed slams
Mountains right ear Mountain clutches his newly-whacked
ear and continues to scream

MOUNTAIN
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

Motion still sped up Ed takes the cue stick and holding it
horizontally vibrates it up and down across Mountains lips
so that his scream burbles

BADABADABADABADABADA

Ed pushes the horizontal cue stick into Mountains mouth--
HUNNGGK

--so that his jaw clamps over it The force of the shove
pushes Mountain onto a bar stool where he now sits with his
back pressed to the bar and Ed himself pressing against his
front

Ed forms an X with his forearms so that his hands are now
crossed in front of him his right hand grabbing the left end
of the jaw-clamped cue stick and vice-versa He pulls his
hands sharply right-way-round giving Mountains head a 180-
degree corkscrew turn Mountains neck snaps with a loud
ratcheting sound his eyes roll up and he spits the cue
stick out-- 64

MOUNTAIN
PTOOEY

--and it clatters onto the bar

Now there is quiet

The reverse shows the front of Mountains body as he rests
back against the bar his head now facing wrong-way-round
his pony-tail hanging over his mountainous chest The
backbar mirror shows his face eyes rolled up like a painting
of John the Baptists head on a platter

Ed steps away to clear the body After a motionless beat it
pitches onto the floor

Silence as the bikers absorb these events
A callow biker is staring down at the motionless hody

CALLOW BIKER
- Mountain You okay

A vengeful biker charges Ed

VENGEFUL BIKER
AAAAAHHHH

With this the spell is broken and all hell breaks loose

MANY BIKERS

INT PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT 65

A RINGING PHONE

A hand reaches in to uncradle it
WIDER

We are in a precinct house Alvin Koski is at his desk

KOSKI
Koski Right Yeah Huh
Okay

He cradles the phone
On his desk is half a tuna-salad sandwich on soggy wax paper

Koski hastily wraps it up and stuffs it into the hip pocket
of his suit jacket as he reaches for his hat

EXT BIKER BAR - NIGHT 66

The parking lot of the biker bar is now clogged with police
vehicles

INT BIKER BAR - NIGHT 67

Koski is just walking in As he stops and takes in the scene
he puts one hand on his hip and with the other rubs the back
of his neck administering the classic surveying-the-scene-of-
the-crime neck massage This pushes up the back of his

fedora to make the front ride low on his forehead

At his feet is a chalk outline showing where a body fell--
Mountains judging by its size and proximity to the bar
Sgt Burns is approaching with his spiral notebook

BURNS
Well Lieutenant it looks like our boy
again No witnesses this time but the
victims all had their necks snapped
Hard to figure what connects these
schmoes to our bonewright but were not
far from Sammys Big-Time and ya cant
argue with the MO

Koski by way of answer gives a low whistle of appreciation

REVERSE
Stretching all the way to the back of the
bar are chalk body outlines mostly on
the floor but some on tables on the pool
table sitting up against the cigarette

SLIDE PROJECTION

It is a map being projected onto a portable screen The map
has little red banners marking certain towns

We hear the ventilating hum of the projector An offscreen
voice

VOICE
Present Puffys Drugs locations are
marked with the red flags You now have
more or less complete penetration of the
Tecumseh Valley area Harper City being
the only town of any size that doesnt
have a Puffys outlet

THE ROOM

A lawyer in a conservative suit has been doing the talking
The Driver in his powder-blue leisure suit sits at the back
of the room on a folding chair placed next to the slide
projector Without any visible cue from the lawyer but
always at the appropriate moment he operates the clicker
that advances the slides He still wears his white gloves

LAWYER
Bliss Drugs is the premier pharmacy in
Harper City

The new slide shows the corner drug store
oe Its owner Edward Bliss Senior and
his wife Marlinda died recently

The projector shows a beaming Ed Senior with his arm around
his wife

ANOTHER VOICE
Cheece Thats too bad

STICKS

He wheels out from behind an executive oak desk He is
riding a top-of-the-line Everest and Jennings wheelchair He
hums around into the beam of the projector and spins to look
into it towards the lawyer

STICKS
- Who will the place go to

LAWYER
The Blisses have a son

The projector advances to show Ed Junior standing full-figure
against a neutral white background His arms are at his
sides but held slightly away from his body with the palms
forward But for a fig leaf over his genitals he is naked

- named Edward Junior He recently

bought a property across the street

apparently with the plan of moving back

to the town having been away for several

years

The projector advances to show a side shot of Ed in the same
pose

oe Hes a chiropractor although he

used to wrestle 68

The projector advances Ed is now crouched in front of blue
seamless in his wrestling leotard arms forward in a classic
comin-atcha pose

LAWYER

Man

STICKS
Where could a fella find this fella if a
fella wanted to you know talk toa

LAWYER
Good question The police are looking
for him in connection with a number of
murders at his former place of
employment Sammys Big-Time Wrestling

STICKS
Huh He looks like a reasonable guy

He looks significantly at the driver
Id sure like to talk to him

CLOSE ON THE DRIVER

No reaction The only movement in frame is the bounce of a
stray lock of hair on his forehead in the breeze from the
projector fan The image of Ed Bliss is reflected in his
tinted aviator glasses

EXT CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 69
FIRE

The roar of the fire hits at the cut snapping off the steady
of the fan

WIDER

Ed sits on the ground legs stretched in front of him arms
folded across his chest staring at the campfire Parked to
one side is a motorcycle

Dolores sits by him cross-legged pushing marshmallows onto a
stick

always knew they werent really what I

Ed continues to stare into the fire Dolores accepts his
silence as a negative She shakes her head and stares at the
fire as well
I didnt think so Im glad were
riding together now My name is Dolores
whats your name
Ed continues to stare into the fire
You dont really care about the
names of things do you You dont chat
The surface thats not where its at is
it When you talk its about the deep
inside And thats where you reach me
you know--deep inside I love you Quiet
Man

Ed continues to stare into the fire
What does it matter the names of
things Why is this a “marshmallow
Theres no reason Things are either bad
or good hard or squushy regardless of
the name I can tell youve had a great
Sorrow Ive never had that Ive never
had anything deep--just uptight parents

dont even have the lowlife friends Im
not blaming you You followed your call
Thats cool Whats your journey man
Where are you going

She takes his right hand looks at his wedding ring
Is there someone else Quiet Man
Is it all about her

Ed frowns at the ring as if noticing it for the first time
He squints thinking trying to remember

HIS POV

We are tight on his hand the Silver band glinting in the

firelight as his large powerful hand turns fingers loosely

upward like the hand of Adam like a sculptor’s perfect

The airy sound is coming from the countertop range A burner
light is on and this mornings kettle its water long since
boiled away has melted onto the electric ring The kettle
is now rippled and twisted and would be unrecognizable but
for its intact handle and the whistle through which metal
vapors feebly push

Koski turns off the burner

He wraps a dish towel around the handle and tries to pick up
the kettle The metal skin of the rangetop puckers out the
kettle has fused with it

clanks He wears white satin pyjamas

When he reaches the bed he grabs one post for support leans
one cane against the wall leans the other cane against the
wall pauses for a moment and then swings himself around
face-down onto the bed

He has landed with his back oddly angled his ass sticking up
in the air we hold perhaps expecting him to shift into a
more comfortable position but he doesnt move This
apparently is how he sleeps

At length he exhales sighing deeply

over the roar of the engine

EXT STREET AT PUFFY DRUG - DAY 84
The motorcycle roars into frame from just off camera and
abruptly stops We are looking over Doloress shoulder at
Eds back
He sits motionless ‘for a beat

DOLORES
What is it

His head turns looking up behind him at a sign they have
just passed

Doloress head turns to follow his look

THEIR POV
The pharmacy sign says Puffys Drugs Beneath the store
name is the motto Take Something For It The accompanying

logo is a carricature of the Driver with his lip curled half
sneer half smile and his finger cocked down at the viewer

ED

Gazing up at the sign struck haunted Without looking at
Dolores he directs her

ED
Wait here

INT PUFFY DRUG - DAY 85
Ed enters and stops Late afternoon sun slants in through
the large front windows The door air-hisses shut behind him

and then there is quiet He is the only customer confronted
by a silent watchful staff

Ed takes the long appraising beat that precedes the showdown
walk

And then he begins the walk down the length of the store
Past the waiting staff

Three men stand evenly spaced behind the fountain counter

all wearing white smocks and white paper counter hats All
have their hands clasped behind their backs and their feet

spread in the posture of military at-ease

Ed walks slowly down the counter looking at them

Their heads swivel as they watch him all smiling politely
Finally the last counterman says

COUNTERMAN
Something from the fountain sir

Ed says nothing keeps walking

He approaches a glass-topped counter with a register on it
Another man white-smocked but hatless is stationed here
His head too pivots to track Ed he also smiles politely

REGISTER MAN
Cigarettes sir Film

He cups ones hand to the side of his mouth and stage-whispers
Condoms

His smile stays in place though Ed does not answer Ed keeps
walking

His long walk stops at the back counter pharmaceuticals
The white-smocked man behind it smiles

PHARMACIST
Drugs sir

Ed looks at him looks back at the empty store and smiling
staff looks back at the pharmacist

ED
May I see the manager please

85

PHARMACIST
Do you have a complaint about the
service sir

Behind Ed the three fountain men vault the counter in
formation and land softly on rubber-soled shoes They spread
across the width of the store and advance cautiously ninja-
style on Eds back

ED
Id just--like--to see--the manager

The pharmacist still smiles pleasantly at Ed
PHARMACIST
And what shall I say is the nature of
your business

ED
The nature of my business is my
business

The three fountain men are closing in still unbeknownst to
Ed

PHARMACIST
Of course sir And your name

The question sets Ed adrift

ED
I think its Ed Somebody called
me “Ed once She had egg running down
her hands But do the names of things

really matter
The pharmactst is blandly agreeable

PHARMACIST
Probably not sir I‘1l1l tell the manager
Ed is here

But he makes no move to tell anyone anything he remains
planted staring at Ed Ed is still drifting lost in
thought Suddenly he cocks his head

ED
Do you smell rye bread and
Limbergher cheese

The center fountain man leaps at him from behind--but Ed is

already swiping something off the pharmaceutical counter
tucking and rolling backwards 85

The center man lands having come up empty facing the
pharmacist Ed shoots up into frame just behind him reaches
around from behind and pinches the mans nose The mans
mouth pops open and Eds other hand reaches around to--PSST--
give him a shot of breath spray

PSST-PSST--He also sprays each of the mans eyes The man
screams temporarily blinded

The two fountain men on either side are nearly within
striking distance but having lost the element of surprise
they edge in slowly looking for an opening

Eds head swivels left and right looking from one to the
other He suddenly crouches below frame

When he straightens again he is holding an ankle of each man
in each of his hands having scooped them out from under He
holds the ankles to either side at waist height

Instead of having their arms tensed for attack the two men
now wave them wildly each hopping up and down on one foot
trying to remain standing

The center man is turning to face Ed and vigorously shaking
his head cto clear his eyes He vocalizes his cheek flaps

CENTER MAN
Wubuduwubudu

Weighing his options Ed stands motionless while men hop
wildly to either side like some especially pointless
vaudeville act

Ed decides he kicks the center man in the crotch He then
spins to face the man on his right letting go of the lefc
mans anklebut keeping it raised by snagging it with his own
foot thrust out behind He is thus himself balanced on one
foot while he gives the right-hand mans ankle a two-handed
joint-smashing twist

He releases that man who screams and collapses and spins to
perform the same operation on the other

He then picks up the crotch-clutching center man and spins

him over his head and launches him at the pharmacist who is
reaching a shotgun from under his counter

INT PUFFYS BACK OFFICE - DAY 86
Its door crashes open before the stumbling-forward weight of

the disarmed pharmacist Arms windmilling wildly he air-
swims into the room until--CLONK--the top of his head slams

86

into the office desk He recoils straightening takes one
step back and stands swaying staring at a bald man seated
behind the desk

The bald man returns his stare his feet up on the desk the
funny papers held forgotten in one hand

The pharmacist eyes still wide slowly reaches up to massage
the back of his neck He cricks his head seems to consider
something for a moment and then falls backward rigid as a
felled tree

Quiet

What would be the pharmacists point of view if he had one
from low looking up at the lip of the desk upon which a
foreground desktop plaque reads MANAGER We hear a chair
creak The top of the managers bald head--then his forehead-
-then his downpeering eyes--come into view as he leans slowly
forward to get a look over the top of his desk

Reverse shows the fallen pharmacist stretching away eyes
staring sightlessly up

Quiet

The managers chair creaks as he now reaches slowly over to
his phone uncradles it and raises an index finger to punch
in the first digit

A sound freezes his finger and indeed every other part of his
body except his eyes which roll up

Ed walks slowly in the door

ED
Are you the manager
The manager still has the handset to his ear and his index
finger poised over the telephone

MANAGER
Is there a problem sir

Ed walks slowly over to the desk He reaches forward with
one hand palm down and slides it under the managers poised
finger to rest it on the telephone

ED

The man on the sign outside--Puffy--does
he own these drug stores 86

He is pressing down on the phone Although he is apparently
not much exerting himself plastic parts of the phone are
crunching popping off bending flat

The manager still has not moved except for his eyes As he
talks he watches the phone disintegrate

MANAGER
No He just fronts for the guy who owns
them Sticks Verona

The manager watches as the circuitry guts of the phone start
to pop apart under Eds steady pressure

Sticks wont use his own picture

Hes a little self-conscious

The electronic innards are ground to dust
about his spine

ED
Where can I find him

MANAGER
Sticks I dont know

Having finished with the phone Ed now reaches for the
handset which the manager slowly hands to him
I know that uh Wednesday hes
meeting a shipment at Emerson Airstrip

Ed takes the handset in two hands and snaps it The
managers eyes are on the handset

Shipment of drugs
Ed pauses stares

‘ ED
You mean--illegal drugs

The manager is surprised at Eds surprise He shrugs

MANAGER
Yeah The drugstores are just a front
For drugs

Ed stares vacantly

forces him into a spinally misaligned humpbacked posture A
line of drool sways unheeded from his lower lip
A voice to which Ed does not react

VOICE
Hey nut job

REVERSE
A burley crewcut male nurse in a white tunic and white cotton

Pants grins down at Ed Over his shoulder another burley
male nurse guffaws stupidly

87

MALE NURSE
Thinkin about a porterhouse steak
nutter

His friend chortles
Hey looney-tunes somebody said you
used to be some kind of fighter
Eddie

Still staring vacantly the drool swaying with the gentle bob
of his head

The male nurses hand enters frame at chest level He
flutters his fingers and lets his hand drift slowly up This

catches Eds attention He gapes wonderingly at the rising
hand

When the hand reaches Eds eye level it abruptly clenches
into a fist and punches him in the nose

Ed blinks surprised by the blow his head swaying mouth
still hanging open

THE NURSES

The guffawing nurse laughs even louder encouraging the first
nurse

MALE NURSE
Dont seem like much of a fighter to me

He steps behind Ed and shoves him

Dont seem like much of a fighter
to me

Ed has lurched into the guffawing nurse

GUFFAWING NURSE
Hey watch where youre going dickwad

He shoves him back into his friend who gives him a forearm
to the face

MALE NURSE
Yeah watch it dickwad

WIDE

We are again high and wide on the corridor as the two nurses
shove and cuff Ed back and forth 87

Lightning flickers thunder crashes and the shuffling man is
coming back down the hall

MAN
Your blue dress matches your eyes
Your red dress matches your eyes

INT EDS CELL - LATER 88

Ed still straitjacketed is balled into a corner of the tiny
room

We hear a clinking though Ed does not react

THE WINDOW

The cells small high window is barred From outside someone
feeds in a short length of chain passes it over a couple of
bars and draws it back outside

ED

Still not reacting From outside we hear the rev of an
engine

THE WINDOW

We hear the engine rev once more and then start to peel out
and the chain clanks tight around the bars--and then relaxes
as the engine noise suddenly drops

EXT MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 89

A motorcycle lies on its side on the parking lot pavement
its rear wheel spinning the chain looped around its rear
shock There is no rider

We pan forward to reveal Dolores several feet in front of
the bike climbing to her feet dusting herself off

She looks at the motorcycle looks around the lot for other
options and--freezes

HER POV

A big white truck On its side it says THE DEL RIO HOSPICEA
Private Environment for the Disturbed The logo is two
crossed butterfly nets It is the facilitys padded
nutwagon

INT EDS CELL - NIGHT 90
Ed is as before

We hear a diesel engine and the grinding of gears Ed does
not react

THE WINDOW
With a much bigger engine noise and grinding of gears the

chain clanks tight and this time the grid of bars tears away
from the cement

EXT CAMPSITE - NIGHT 91
MUD

Bloop bloo-wump bla-bloop the mud is slowly
bubbling

A pair of hands enters to scoop some up
WIDER

Flumff£--Dolores splats the mud down onto Eds back Ed is
stretched out on the ground illuminated by the campsites
flickering fire He has been stripped but his loins are
swaddled in white cotton fabric--probably a remnant of his
hospital-wear He gazes dully into the fire

Dolores gets another handful of mud from the large mud pot
and flumps it onto Eds back

DOLORES
Its a blend of natural muds Theyll
speed the drugs out of your system Quiet
Man

She kneels and talks perhaps to Ed perhaps to herself as

she kneads the mud into Eds back
- I got rid of my navel ring I
might get rid of the nose ring too Im
not gonna puncture my skin any more It
never really made me happy Im just
gonna follow you Quiet Man You know
You know that theres something higher

She wipes a hand on her shirt and reaches a marshmallow from
a bag She puts the marshmallow in Eds hand
Feel the marshmallow

It closes over the marshmallow
CLOSE ON ED
Blank eyes staring at the fire Dolores continues off

INT PRECINCT HOUSE- NIGHT 92

It is late at night All the desks are empty except one the
lamp of which forms a lonely pool

CLOSER

Koski sits at the desk feet up hat shoved back slowly
leafing through a file

THE FILE

Koski is reading a report under the letterhead of The Clapham
School of Chiropractic

The report is titled Evaluation of Degree Candidate Edward
Bliss Jr Clipped to one corner is a student ID photo of
Ed in a white smock grinning at the camera

A slash of light vignettes one passage

Bliss is a natural healer His inter-personal skills and
physical “touch are excellent However Bliss also displays
a propensity for abstract chiropractic speculation which
left unchecked could lead to grave and even dangerous
errors

KOSKI

92

He looks up from the file and eyes narrowing looks off into
space considering

EXT CAMPSITE - DAWN 93
CAMPFIRE ASHES

Smoke wisps up from the caved-in remains of the campfire in
the flat pre-dawn light

DOLORES
She is asleep on the ground

We hear grunting gasps stress sounds from offscreen
Accompanying them are intermittent tendon snaps and joint
pops

Dolores stirs wipes the sleep from her eyes and reacting to
the sounds looks around

HER POV

Dolores is looking upon a feat unheard of in chiropractic
literature a feat which most doctors of chiropractic would
dismiss as flatly impossible It is nevertheless being
performed before her eyes

Still wearing his loincloth but now alert totally intent on
what he is doing and with great gasps and grunts of effort
Ed is adjusting himself

He presses his back against a tree trunk and reaches back
with both arms to clasp hands behind the trunk He grits his
teeth and tenses and after a beat of straining suspense we
hear his back pop He relaxes with a great exhale

He grabs one forearm with the other hand and strains
pulling like an overtaxed weightlifter We hear a tendon
give as the arm finally aligns

He breathes deeply for a few moments and then repeats the
operation on the other arm

He reaches up to put his hands on either side of his jaw He
pauses for a long moment and then suddenly as if to
surprise his own head gives it a hard twist

He exhales deeply and rolls his head in easy circles

Dolores watches with rapt attention She probably senses as
do we that she is witnessing a heroic excercise of will

93A

93

which may some day become chiropractic legend whispered from
chiropractor to chiropractor down through generations

Ed finishes rolling his head and limbering his shoulders a
beat to collect himself and then he walks away striding out
of the campsite into the early-morning mist without a
backward look

Doloress eyes are locked on his receding back She murmurs

DOLORES
- Goodbye Quiet Man

She burst into tears and buries her face in her hands as we
hear the sound of his motorcycle grow distant and faint

EXT EMERSON AIRSTRIP - DAY 93A

A remote private airstrip whose control tower is a hut on
stilts and whose runway is little more than a cleared field
It is day but dark A storm is moving in and a restless
wind stirs the trees that line the runway

A small cube truck with the Puffys Drugs logo is parked with
its open back facing the runway and its tailgate down On
the tailgate sits what looks like a large lazy susan from
which two upright levers protrude like large gearshifts On
the lazy susan is Sticks Veronas Everest and Jennings
wheelchair In the wheelchair is Sticks

Sitting on the edge of the tailgate with his legs gaily
dangling is the Driver He wears his powder-blue leisure
suit He is eating a peanut-butter-and-bacon sandwich

Parked at the edge of the field is a forklift Its driver a
man in an industrial jump suit with the Puffys logo on the
back sits waiting

The strip is buzzed by a rattling 1952 twin-engine Regency
turboprop bearing the Puffys Drugs logo It roars past the
cube truck right-to-left and as it does so Sticks pulls one
lever and pushes the other so that the lazy susan spins to
let him watch

INT CONTROL TOWER - DAY 94

Lavrenti a burly man with greasy skin and coarse black body
hair sprouting over the neck of his long-sleeved sweatshirt
pivots in his swivel chair to watch the plane rumble past
He talks into a tabletop microphone

LAVRENTI

Okay Snow White youre cleared for
approach and landing from the south

94

With a burst of static

RADIO VOICE
Roger that

We hear the hum of the receding airplane and the nearby
chirring of crickets unsettled by the approaching storm
Lavrenti leans back rubs his neck pulls a cigarette from
the pack on the table in front of him pulls a girly lighter
from his pocket and lights up He slips the lighter back in
his pocket

We hear the tone shift of the distant plane as it banks into
a U-turn

Suddenly--the crickets stop

Silence but for the plane steady and the ominously rustling
trees

LAVRENTI
Hn
He squints out the big window The late-afternoon dark gives
him little to see but his own reflection He turns off the
table lamp to better see out

Nothing on the veranda that rings the hut Nothing outside
Still something

The mournful tinkle of windchimes

The crickets resume

Lavrenti cocks his head not fully reassured

He hunches forward over the table--an odd posture We hear
the sibilant sound of tape giving way and he pulls his hand
out from under the table He now holds a revolver

Eyes fixed on the window he slowly stands

The drone of the approaching aircraft is growing louder

CREEEAK--with the back of his knees Lavrenti pushes the
Swivel chair away We hear it creakily roll to a stop

Eyes on the window Lavrenti takes a cautious step toward the
veranda door

CREEEAK--from behind the swivel chair rolls slowly back
toward him It bumps the back of his knees

84 94
Lavrenti freezes We are behind him He slowly slowly
turns his head to profile” His eyes wide with fear roll

back to look behind--toward us--

LAVRENTI
--AAHH

Ed in his leotard is almost incorporeal in the last of the
daylight

ED
Siddown

The terrified Lavrenti finds his resolve he raises the
revolver and--

LAVRENTI
AAAAHHH
Click Clickety-click-click

He looks stupidly at the gun All chambers empty
» Huh

Ed takes the few steps that separate them The plane is
growing louder

ED
Why do you defy me

LAVRENTI
AAAAHHHAAHAAA--

Screams of terror drowned out by the approaching airplane
and cut off by Eds hand on his throat

UNDERNEATH THE TABLE

Two pieces of tape hang down on either side of a time-faded
silhouette of the gun

We pan over to a piece of yellowing scotch tape that holds
six bullets against the underside of the table

We can hear Lavrentis gurgles as Ed continues to choke him
BACK TO ED
He is lifting and shaking Lavrenti as he throttles him

THE FLOOR 94

Lavrentiis being lifted out of his loafers His rising toes
curl desperately after his receding shoes

ED

He effortlessly flips Lavrenti to hold him upside down so
that he can probe with his thumbs under his kneecaps

The screams resume louder and louder but they will bring no
help the room is rattled by the roar of the arriving
airplane

THE FLOOR

The contents of Lavrentis pockets thunk down coins bill
clip keys girly lighter and finally after a beat his

lucky rabbits foot

EXT AIRSTRIP - DAY 95

Sticks watches the arriving plane with a dreamy smile and a
song burbling on his lips

STICKS
I like a Gershwin tune how ‘bout you
I like a cocaine spoon how ‘bout you

THE DRIVER

In a very close shot the Drivers tinted aviator glasses half-
reflect the approaching plane half-reveal his dead heavy-
lidded eyes

He daintily licks a stray curl of peanut butter off a gloved
finger then cocks his head and gives an unself-conscious
belch

THE RUNWAY “

Like a big fat bumblebee the plane completes its wobbling
approach It hits the field makes an ungainly bounce or
two slows and comes to rest

The man on the forklift drives out toward the plane as
someone inside the plane opens its cargo door

Sticks bellows at the Driver over the roar of the engines

STICKS
Tell Lavrenti to help unload

The Driver climbs awkwardly off the tailgate and heads for
the control tower

INT KOSKIS CAR - DAY 96
KOSKIS POV

A siren blasts in at the cut We are looking over Koskis
shoulder as he careens up the street in his unmarked car and
halts at Puffys Drugs

Burns is trotting out of the building open suitcoat
flapping He leans in Koskis window to breathlessly relay

BURNS
Four corpses but we found the manager
tossing pills into a suitcase in
preparation for flight He said our boy
is going to the Emerson Airstrip to knock
off Sticks Verona whos there meeting a
drug shipment

Glances at his watch
Should be there right now

INT CONTROL TOWER 97

From inside we are looking at the door slightly ajar The
Driver gives it a push CREEEEEEAK --it swings slowly in

The Driver stands motionless in the doorway
A silent beat
A weak voice

VOICE
Help me

The Driver Walks slowly in

EXT AIRSTRIP 98
A man standing in the hold of the plane tosses boxes out to

the forklift driver who stacks them on the forklift

Neither man talks the roar of the idling engine is too loud
In the cockpit the pilot sits reading the newspaper

INT CONTROL TOWER 99
The Driver edges cautiously in

Somewhere the tinkling windchimes

The voice weakly repeats

99
VOICE
Help me

The Driver rounds a corner to see Lavrenti He is seated
facing us his arms pulled back behind his swivel chair

He looks pleadingly at the Driver
Untie my arms

EXT AIRSTRIP 100
Sticks is still singing on the tailgate

STICKS
I like the month of June

INT COCKPIT 101
The pilot clears his throat and turns a page

INT CONTROL TOWER 102
The Driver edges toward the chair

LAVRENTI
Help me

The Driver sticks one foot cautiously out He pushes the
seat of the swivel chair creeeeeeak--it slowly turns to show
Lavrentis back

Lavrentis arms are indeed tied behind him Not with rope--
the arms themselves have been twisted around each other and

knotted His two hands protrude from the knot helplessly
waggling

By way of reaction the Driver arches one eyebrow

DRIVER
whuhhhhh

Behind the Driver Ed drops out of the rafters to the floor

ED
HA

The Driver spins and adapts the karate first position
familiar perhaps from many Vegas shows

DRIVER
Huhhh

They stand facing each other studying both at the ready

102
The Driver abruptly launches into a series of air-chops and
kicks none of them intended to land It is display

DRIVER
Huh Whuh Unk Huh

He swings again only this time he tears the heart graphic off
of Eds costume
Hi-ee Huh (ripppp)

The routine ends with the Driver resuming first position
holding Eds cloth heart in his hand

Ed counters with a dying swan melting towards the floor his
arms gracefully sweeping out to the side

The Driver looks down at Ed puddled on the floor confused
What sort of intimidation is this

Suddenly

ED
HA

He performs a Bouncing Betty leaping up and driving a fist
into the Drivers crotch

The Drivers eyes beneath his aviators show no reaction
At length

DRIVER
Hanka verra muchshsh

Ed tilts his head dismayed
A second effort

ED
YAAAAAAAAAHHH

He gives the Drivers crotch a hyperfast double-fisted
drubbing like a boxer at a speed bag

The Driver dispassionately watches

DRIVER
Hank yew

With remarkable speed and power the Driver reaches down and
clamps his left hand around Eds throat and draws him up

Ed clamps his left hand around the Drivers throat 102
The Driver raises his right hand high It clutches a
hypodermic needle
It swings down

It is arrested by Eds right hand clasping the Drivers
wrist

A standoff hand-to-throat hand-to-hand
Ed gasps and purples as the Driver chokes him off
The Driver shows no reaction to Eds squeezing hand

The two right hands tremble with tension the hypodermic
still aiming at Ed

EXT AIRSTRIP 103
At the cargo hold the two men are still unloading boxes
INT COCKPIT 104

The pilot pulls a pencil from behind his ear and starts
working the Jumble

INT CONTROL TOWER 105
Under steady pressure the hypodermic begins to turn inward
Ed gasps with effort

The Driver still shows no reaction but the needle is now
pointing at his own head

It starts moving slowly in toward his temple

The Drivers eyes remain expressionless but finally his
concern begins to show sweat stands out on his forehead

The needle closes--closes--closes its glinting tip a drop
of obedience-serum beading on it disappears into the poof of
jet black hair at the Drivers temple

Ed trembles strains

The hypodermic advances by microinches stops
vibrates

Eds powerful hand wraps around the Drivers His thumb

shaking closes over the Drivers thumb which rests on the
plunger

105
A bead of sweat rolls down the Drivers forehead His eyes
roll slowly to the side toward the needle
Eds thumb trembles and whitens under the pressure
Thumb squeezes thumb
The serum flows into the needle

The Drivers eyes roll slowly forward One side of his lip
arches slowly into a half-sneer

DRIVER
Whuhhhh

INT COCKPIT 106
The pilot frowns down at the Jumble With the eraser end of
his pencil he scratches thoughtfully at his jaw We hear it
scratch against his beard stubble

STICKS ON THE TAILGATE

He drums his fingers impatiently on the wheelchair armrest
and murmurs

Ed finishes pushing bullets into the revolver and hands it to

He takes another hard turn and Burns steadies himself with
one hand against the roof

HOLY SHIIIIIII--

EXT AIRSTRIP 110

The Driver is leaving the control tower gun held loosely at
his side

We intercut him and his point of view of Sticks waiting
further up the runway and on the opposite side

As he approaches the airplane from behind one of its
whirling propellors is between him and Sticks but it- hardly
impede his view He advances without expression

As he draws even with the cargo hold the man who is unloading
from inside notices him

The man below loading the forklift follows the other mans
look He yells to be heard over the engines

FORKLIFT MAN
Hey Give us a hand

The Driver turns and casually shoots him in the chesc

HOLD MAN
What the--

110
The Driver shoots him as well The man staggers and is about
to fall
CLOSE ON STICKS
Looking at the plane
HIS POV
The view is partially blocked by the whirling propellor and
the wing itself We can see most of the Driver though his
head is cropped by the wing We can just see what might be
part of the prone forkliftman mostly blocked by the
forklift We can see only the smallest corner of the cargo
bay door most of which is blocked by the fuselage
Something--a hand perhaps--drops and swings from the bay

The closest person is the pilot who sits calmly up in the
cockpit working the Jumble

STICKS
He squints Its hard to figure whats going on
BACK TO THE PLANE

Both of the loaders are dead the Driver turns to resume his
walk toward Sticks

He clears the angled body of the plane so that Sticks is
clearly in view directly behind a whirling prop He
advances He starts to raise his gun

STICKS

Squinting What seems to be happening makes no sense
THE DRIVER

Advancing zombielike on Sticks closer and closer to the
whirring propellor

STICKS
Who me
THE DRIVER

Closer--closer--the gun now fully extended in front of him--
advancing toward the prop

INT COCKPIT 111
The jumble has the pilot stumped
THE PUZZLE

It reads “Hotel Sierra over two words with eight empty
squares

THE PILOT
Still baffled he bites lower lip

A brief razz--like a lawnmower snagging--interrupts the
steady whir of the props and the plane shakes slightly

THE TACHOMETER
The needle jumps back several hundred RPM
THE PILOT

Looks up cranes to look back along the right wing thrrough
red smeared plexiglass

EXT AIRSTRIP 112

The Driver backward-staggers into frame His formerly
extended right arm is now a sawed-off stumpy forearm but
that is the least of it

Not only the front of his leisure suit but the skin over the
entire front of his body has been chewed away His nose is
goneand his face is flayed red tissue in which two lidless
eyeballs register white surprise

He looks down at his exposed innards

DRIVER
Whoa Cant believe it

The leading end of his small intestine starts to slip out of
his abdomen He watches as the intestine unravels with more
and more speed The last of its twenty-five-foot length
slithers out and he swipes after the tail end with his
remaining hand

No go it plops onto the ground in front of him
Whoa

After a short beat his stomach sloshes out onto the ground
Ngghhnn

One by one his lungs drop into his abdominal cavity and then
flop out onto the ground His lower spinal column is
exposed

His hand reaches for something in his inside coat pocket at
the tattered edge of what remains of his coat

Watching What the--
THE DRIVER

He one-handedly pops the top of his pill vial tilts his head
back and gulps the multi-colored pills

The pills bounce down and out of the exposed end of his
esophagus

The Driver gazes mournfully down at the wasted pills
One last sad beat and he tips backward dead

start the tailgate humming down

He pulls an automatic pistol from an inside pocket and slams
in a clip

The airplane is bumping off down the runway

Ed Bliss is running for the abandoned forklift

Sticks has reached ground level and is motoring his
wheelchair forward one hand on the controls the other
clutching his gun

Ed climbs into the forklift and fires it up

Sticks puts his chair in overdrive and outrigger wheels drop
down

Ed revs and grinds gears shifting up
He and Sticks head directly at each other like jousters
Sticks sights down the pistol bellowing -

What have you done

He fires--BANG

That was ‘a beautiful man
BANG PING Ed wrestles with the gears
Drug problem sure

BANG -BANG
PING-PING

But he needed help Understanding
Not that

WHOOO-WHOO-WHOO--Koskis unmarked car bounces onto the field
heading directly at the oncoming plane

The plane clumsily lifts off and clears the car which races
on toward the jousters

The wheelchair and forklift are short yards apart

But Ed is leaping from the forklift as--pffft--the bullet
tears through his seat back and--CRUNCH--the wheelchair and
forklift collide

STICKS

AAAAHHH

The scooped wheelchair is forced backwards Sticks grabs in
agony at the back of his neck

His upraised elbow is snagged by Ed now on foot reaching
in He yanks Sticks free

Ed has him from behind Behind both men the unmanned
forklift receeds down the runway

uselessly out to either side like a scarecrows

Ed tenses preparing to inflict the ultimate but--

And she needs you

Sticks with his head forced down speaks in a squashed-
larynx voice

She does need you Eddie

Ed continues to stare at Koski

KOSKI
Dont make her raise your child alone

Ed stares digesting this

Ed has abruptly wrenched Sticks neck cutting off his
speech Sticks‘ eyes stare

A beat of motionless quiet

Finally Ed releases Sticks and steps away and Sticks sways
but

Does not drop

As he sways it slowly dawns on Sticks that not only is he not
dead he is no longer crippled

He looks up

Sticks experimentally rolls his head Feels good
He takes one stiff halting step
And another
He grins
Say
He performs some jumping jacks
Say
He runs in place arms pumping

I can

He is bending forward at the waist

He reaches toward his toes and pulls up a pants leg to
reveal a detringer in an ankle holster

He quickly straightens raising the gun and--
- Say goodbye Eddie

It rests gently on the fabric--a hospital gown--over a

We hear the rhythmic sounds of intensive care--hissing

We pan down the mans hand to its wrist manacled We
pan along the chain to the mans other hand which
reaches for a womans hand resting palm-down on the

through the doorway

squeezes through and slowly heads for Eddie

INT HOSPITAL ROOM 119
EDS POV
We approach a peaceful glowing Kim
FADE TO BLACK
Hold for a beat The snap of a light switch fade up fast to
INT KOSKIS BEDROOM - NIGHT 120
Late at night
Empty and a mess
After a beat we hear tinkling ice and Koski walks into frame
holding a whiskey His suit is disheveled and his hat is
pushed carelessly back
He sits on the edge of the bed takes a sip of the drink and
looks dully off After a beat he thumps at his breast
pocket

He takes out a cigarette pack looks at it and crumples it
and throws it aside empty

He glances fleetingly at the ashtray on the nightstand and

then looks again frowning After a beat he reaches in with
one finger and flips a couple of butts aside evaluating

120

He picks out one butt not terribly short and sticks it in his

mouth

He reaches into a side coat pocket for a kitchen

match and strikes it on the bedframe

He lights the butt takes a deep hungry drag

He lays down on the bed

He holds
He blows
He gazes

HIS POV

A smoke

the smoke in
it slowly out

at the smoke wreathing away

ring floats to the ceiling

THE END
