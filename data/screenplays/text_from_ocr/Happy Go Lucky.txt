A bright sunny day An attractive young woman rides
her bicycle through Central London Her hair blows
free and she is relaxed and contented Occasionally
she waves and smiles at passers-by

She gets off her bicycle and chains it to some
railings alongside some other bikes

Now she is walking through a busy market She glances
briefly at a stall then notices a bookshop She looks
in its window

A moment later POPPY for that is her name enters the
bookshop Looking round she spots a book and smiles
She pulls it out a little It’s ‘The Road To Reality’
by Roger Penrose

POPPY
‘The Road To Reality’ Dont wanna be
going there

(She laughs to herself A young male shop assistant is
working behind the counter He wears a woolly Rasta
hat and has a beard and dreadlocks He is white)

POPPY
Hiya Oasis of calm in here mad out
there

(No reply from the assistant who is preoccupied with
his computer)

POPPY
Gorgeous day for it though isn’t it
(She moves away into the shop) Never
been in here before

(Poppy enters the childrens book section She picks up
a brightly coloured book called ‘Kingdom Of The Sun’
She opens it and smiles)
A few minutes later in another part of the shop she
is reading an adult book The ASSISTANT comes over and
puts some books on a shelf next to her

POPPY
I like your hat

(He reacts a little as though shes said something
outrageous then slopes off She glances after him)

A few moments later POPPY drifts over to the counter

POPPY
Busy (He ignores her) Hello (Still
no response) ‘Avin’ a bad day

(He looks at her Pause)

ASSISTANT
No

POPPY
Ooh Not ‘til I showed up eh
(Laughing) You look like a rabbit
caught in the headlights I won’t
bite Don’t worry I’m going now Have
a good day Stay happy (She opens the
door Cockney accent) “I ain’t nicked
nothin’ Honest guv’nor” (She makes
the sound of a burglar alarm) Beep
Beep Beep

(She laughs As she leaves a youth with long hair and
spectacles enters the shop)

Poppy walks briskly back to where she parked her
bicycle It has been stolen

POPPY
Oh no - no Come on (She looks
round Lots of people and traffic but
no bike She laughs) That’s just
brilliant that is Oh no I didn’t
even get a chance to say goodbye

(She walks off)
A large packed dance hall Spotlights POPPY and four
other young women are bopping energetically to ‘Common
People’ by Pulp

Dawn An empty street The five women meander along
chattering A taxi drives by

They arrive at a flat over a corner cafe and enter a
side door

A little later We are in POPPY’s living room -
cluttered eclectic jolly jokey Daylight just
through the closed curtains but the lights are on
POPPY ZOE her flatmate SUZIE POPPY’s sister and
DAWN and ALICE SUZIE’s friends Much laughter and
giggling throughout this scene

DAWN
The music’s stopped

ALICE
It stopped ages ago (She bursts into

giggles)

ZOE
(Smoking)

(ALICE and POPPY shriek with
laughter) What What’s so funny

ALICE

(SUZIE in a multi-coloured anorak with the hood up
has been dozing)

SUZIE
Can you just - (She makes a gesture
that sort of means “make less noise”)

ZOE
Oh your sister’s woken up Poppy

(POPPY imitates SUZIEs gesture - forefinger and thumb
half an inch apart)

DAWN
Suzie what’s that

ALICE
What is it

POPPY
Is that your latest conquest Aah -

(POPPY ALICE and DAWN laugh)

ZOE

imaginary dagger ALICE and DAWN
giggle uproariously)

SUZIE

rubber breast pads)
POPPY
Fingers on the tits

ZOE
Oh that is properly disgusting

POPPY
Chicken fillets Lunch anyone - ooh

a telephone )

DAWN

POPPY
(Handing it over)

(She chucks the other pad over to the
sofa where it lands between ZOE and
SUZIE )

ZOE

(ALICE prods DAWNs bosom )

ZOE
Oh look - you’ve got three tits

ZOE

fours )

(ALICE pats POPPY on the bottom with her shoe)

ALICE

the sofa and squats behind ZOE)

(POPPY indulges in a bit of jokey slapstick she falls
off the sofa winding up in a bizarre position with her
head between her feet Laughter)

ZOE
I think we know where Poppy’s sleeping
tonight

Viewed from an upstairs window DAWN and ALICE link
arms as they walk away from the flat

A little later in POPPY’s bedroom POPPY opens the
curtains She has shed her exotic clubbing appearance
and is wearing jeans and a top

POPPY
Time to get up Sleepy-Head

(Suzy is in Poppys double bed Poppy sits by her She
is carrying two mugs )

sound )

SUZIE
Oh yeah

(SUZIE does a joke sideways crab-walk out of sight
POPPY laughs Then SUZIE reappears and resumes her
earlier direction POPPY watches her for a moment then
comes in closing the door)

A little later POPPY takes some old wooden rods out of
a hall cupboard She is also carrying other assorted
sticks paper and egg-boxes She climbs a small
staircase coinciding with ZOE who is coming down the
main staircase with an armful of books Both women go
into the living room POPPY dumps her load on the
coffee table ZOE sits on the sofa and opens a large
coloured children’s book

Now POPPY comes down the stairs with a further arm-
load of assorted items included a toy seagull and
plenty of books Again she unloads on the table

A few minutes later POPPY and ZOE are now both on the
sofa Each is looking through a coloured picture book
POPPY

Be amazing to fly wouldn’t it
ZOE

You reckon
POPPY

Just - phooo
ZOE

What like ‘Mr Vertigo’

POPPY her book)

POPPY

POPPY
Chickens - we could do chickens
ZOE
Chickens don’t fly
POPPY
Lazy buggers What are we gonna make
then
ZOE

I don’t know - what d’you think

POPPY
I dunno

Now ZOE has a large brown paper bag over her head Her
forefingers are pointing to the position of her eyes
POPPY is armed with a big felt-tip pen

POPPY

Where are they

(She puts two fingers

Here

on the bag)

ZOE

POPPY

They’re that far apart are they

Yeah Don’t

ZOE

POPPY

I wasn’t going near you

(She draws two dots ZOE takes off the bag POPPY has
one too They each proceed to cut holes in the bags
with pairs of scissors)

ZOE

You should ask an adult to help you

POPPY

(Smiling)
I don’t know any

POPPY rushes down the stairs On her head is her paper
bag now decorated with eyes and a beak and some

colours She is draped
striped fabric and is
flapping her arms She
mirror that is leaning

in a large piece of boldly
making squawking noises and
sails across the room to a large

POPPY

I think they’re quite good

(Z0E is still on the sofa head unadorned )

Yeah What d

ZOE

her face)

POPPY

(The bag-mask back over her face she makes bird-
tweeting noises to her reflection)

The next day An urban environment Old buildings Lots
of parked cars A small yellow Fiat pulls up ZOE gets
out and takes a large cardboard box and a bag out of
her boot A woman passes her

ZOE
Hi Liz

LIZ
Hi Zoe How are you

Meanwhile POPPY is standing in a crowded bus which
jolts suddenly POPPY laughs sharing the moment with a
friendly middle-aged man in a suit She is holding
various bags and rolls of coloured paper

She runs along a line of trees and a wall She goes
through a pair of high yellow modern gates and enters
a low building

Now POPPY is standing in front of a large brightly
coloured home-made map of the world She is teaching a
class of seven-year old children

POPPY
And birds that live here in North
America they fly all the way to South
America Yeah Now that’s a journey-
and-a-half isn’t it But the biggest
journey of them all is of the Arctic

yeah - all the way - wow - across
the world - to the South Pole Isn’t
that incredible From the North to the
South Pole and that is - sssh - and
that is nine thousand three hundred
miles - that’s right Wow Wow

A little later POPPY crosses her classroom She
carries plastic paint bottles She speaks to an unseen
kid

POPPY
Alright Nick You can do the other
side now

The kids are making bird masks from their paper bags -
cutting out painting gluing POPPY is sitting at a
table with three kids helping one of them

POPPY
What we can doShall we give him -

A few minutes later A boy at another table is painting
his mask purple POPPY picks up the mask she’s been
working on

POPPY
He’s got eyebrows look (She laughs)
Yeah (The kids laugh) I think that’s
brilliant That’s brilliant

Meanwhile in her school - a different one - ZOE is
supervising her children and their mask-making

ZOE
Now thenShall I put some more
yellow in that (She refills a pot)
There we go What colours d’you think

CHILD

ZOE
Do rainbows - rainbows like

sits at a table) Finished it Let’s

kid) Youre hungry It’s going to be

Back in POPPY’s classroom all the kids have their
finished bags on their heads and are standing up

(POPPY leads them all in flapping their wings jumping
up and down and making exuberant bird noises)

POPPY
Oh wow Thats fantastic Look at you

Later in POPPY’s now empty classroom TASH another
teacher is sitting on a desk examining one of the
masks while POPPY packs away her lap-top etc

TASH
Bit dangerous innit
POPPY

TASH

I said basically you’ve got to tell
Cherie-Ann that she’s got to put this
girl on a diet

POPPY
Give her a complex - she’s only seven

TASH
All of a sudden Mum doesn’t want to
get involved for the first time in
her life

POPPY

(POPPY is now fully loaded with her stuff ready to
leave)

TASH
Then I’m just leaving the house and
my two aunts arrive from Dollis Hill

aunt voice) “Tash you got a

from POPPY) I was like “No I

a mortgage in the near future Thank

door and left

POPPY

women and men are doing the same

Flap-flap-flapping away they were

ZOE

ZOE
I had to nip it in the bud with my

out of the window

POPPY
It was okay though was it

ZOE
Oh yeah - I played them Stravinsky

and goes out)

A busy trendy bar A light summer evening POPPY ZOE
and TASH dressed for a night out are sitting at a
table with their drinks

ZOE
Oh I love the end of the week
POPPY
You don’t say
ZOE
Yeah I do actually
POPPY
Oh do you
ZOE

Yeah
POPPY
Oh

ZOE
You know I take this dance class on a
Friday afternoon Tash for Golden
Time

TASH
Yeah

ZOE
I swear to God like half the kids
are bigger than me

POPPY
That’s not hard though is it eh
Titch

ZOE
No I don’t mean taller I mean wider

POPPY
Well you want to be careful - you
know you don’t want the kids jumping
about expressing themselves - bit
dangerous

ZOE
Yeah

TASH
Well you do all that on Friday but
then they spend the rest of the
weekend indoors glued to their
Nintendo DS

ZOE
Totally Right a couple of weeks ago
I came in on a Monday morning - I told
Poppy right - sat the kids down for
Carpet Time asked them what they’d
been doing over the weekend

TASH
Yeah

ZOE
Really gorgeous weather Not one of
them had been out - they’d all been
sitting at home on their Play
Stations

POPPY
And then you couldn’t get them off the
carpet again

ZOE
Yeah when they did get up they were
like wheezing

POPPY
Well that’s pollution for you

ZOE
We always used to go to the park

POPPY
Yeah but a lot of them dont have
parks to go to

TASH
Yeah exactly

ZOE
Yeah I know but then again you don’t
need a park to go for a walk

POPPY
Yeah but if Mum and Dad don’t go out
the kids don’t go out

TASH

Yeah a lot of parents are too
frightened to let the kids play out
Even a bit of green outside their
estate they don’t let them play
there

POPPY

Yeah but it’s hard for a lot of mums
and dads isn’t it I mean they’ve
had a hell of a week they’re under a
lot of pressure and stress -

ZOE
Tell me about it

POPPY
They get back from work - if they’ve
got work to get back from You
knowa lot of them are single mums
They’re exhausted It’s completely
understandable if they don’t take
their kids out for a lovely picnic
with strawberries and cream

TASH
Yeah but it’s not acceptable I know
life’s hard If you want to finda
way you find it innit Some parents
just can’t be bothered

POPPY
Yeah I know
ZOE
Yeah so instead they let their kids
stay up half the night on chat-rooms

TASH
Yeah
ZOE
Yeah - that’s worrying
TASH
Scary
POPPY

Makes me so angry

TASH
You know a lot of seven-year-olds
know more about the Internet than we
do

POPPY
Well at least people are talking
about it That’s a good thing isn’t
it

ZOE
Is it

POPPY
Well yeah - it means we’re aware

ZOE
Well I’m aware smoking’s bad for me -
doesn’t mean I’m going to stop

POPPY
Well as long as you know what’s going
to kill you

ZOE
Oh yeah - thanks
POPPY
That’s alright - any time
TASH
I know drinking’s bad for me but you
know (West Indian accent) I can’t

help myself (She takes a swig)

ZOE
Oh shame (She lights a cigarette)

POPPY
Cheers

ZOE
Cheers everyone Here’s to our
livers and all who drown in them
Careful Poppy - you’ve got your first
driving lesson tomorrow

TASH
Oh boy

POPPY
Oh yeah - quick put that down (She
puts down her drink)

TASH
You don’t want to mess up your blind

spot Poppy

POPPY
Oh wow That sounds good (She covers
her eyes) Oh it’s here (ZOE holds
up two fingers behind POPPYs head)
How many fingers

(They all laugh)

The next day POPPY and ZOE’s hall The doorbell rings
ZOE comes out of the kitchen holding a mug and a
cigarette POPPY rushes down the stairs

ZOE
That must be for you

POPPY
(Sings)
I’m so excited

ZOE
Yeah I think you should do some deep
breathing before you get in the car
(POPPY does mock deep breathing and
looks out of the window)

POPPY
Ooh Can’t see him (Going) Wish me
luck

ZOE

Good luck Ill keep the Emergency
Services on stand-by

POPPY
(Off)
Any excuse eh I know what you’re

In the street POPPY comes out of the flat

POPPY

an earring)

You can’t control a car in high heels

POPPY
Oh no - I can do a lot of things in
these You should see me in these
babies on a dance floor

SCOTT
Well they may be good on a dance
floor -

POPPY

floor they are - ooh

on a beach when you’re pissed with

suitable for driving

POPPY
You’re funny

SCOTT
Now next week I want you to bring
flat-soled shoes

POPPY

I don’t care how you look - it’s how
you drive

the pyramid you see the all-seeing
eye Enrahah Can you repeat that
please En-ra-hah

POPPY
Are you talking about the Eye of
Lucifer

SCOTT
No

POPPY

Because I don’t know if I want to look
in there thank you very much

angels before Lucifer There is
Enrahah Raziel and Lucifer

phone-book

SCOTT

SCOTT
Bear with me
POPPY

I can’t see him

SCOTT
It’s a teaching tool

POPPY
Oh is it
SCOTT
Let me explain something to you about
teaching Poppy

POPPY
Go on then

SCOTT
The teacher’s job is to bring out good
habits in the pupil and to get rid of
bad habits He does that through
frequent repetitive thinking and he
does that by creating clear and
distinct images that are easy for the
pupil to retain

POPPY
Oh Does he now

SCOTT
Yes

POPPY

Don’t worry - it’s buried in there
It’s buried in there

SCOTT
You see You remember You will
remember Enrahah till the day you die
and I will have done my job

POPPY
Why don’t you have something nice up
there like a giant strawberry or
something

SCOTT
Because it works Believe you me it
works Okay - stop

POPPY
Oh What What am I doing now

the gear-stick

POPPY

SCOTT
Please take your foot off the pedal

POPPY

Poppy

POPPY
Yeah

SCOTT
This car is my livelihood This car is
how I earn my living - I mean I dont
know how you earn you living right

POPPY
Yeah

SCOTT
But if I walked into your pub or your
discotheque or your club and I walked
up to the DJ and I scratched all his
records or I smash all the glasses
and I said ‘I’m sorry I didn’t know
what I was doing’ that wouldn’t be
acceptable would it

POPPY
Well there’s only one problem with
that I don’t own a bar or a disco
I’m just a primary school teacher

SCOTT
Are you

POPPY
‘Fraid so kiddo Are you a Satanist
Scott

SCOTT

POPPY makes an “Im watching you gesture SCOTT looks
at her then drives off As POPPY is opening her front
door a man walks past with a dog)

POPPY

A little later POPPY is kneeling next to ZOE who is
sitting in an armchair holding open a copy of The
Highway Code

ZOE

other)

POPPY
Who’s going to blink first (They move
closer to each other until their
noses almost touch) D’you want a
cuppa tea

ZOE
Yes please

POPPY and HEATHER rush out of their school HEATHER is
speaking into her mobile

HEATHER
No you have the lasagne tonight - we
can finish the chicken tomorrow
alright Look I can’t talk now See
you later

(They have arrived at HEATHERs car They get in)

POPPY
Think we’1ll make it

HEATHER
Depends on the traffic

POPPY
Should be alright

(They leave at great speed)

Now they both rush into a large civic hall where the
Flamenco class is just starting About twenty-five
adults mostly women are spread out facing the
teacher who is standing in front of a line of mirrors

TEACHER
(Spanish accent)
Come in ladies - quick as you can
D’you want to put your bags Then
there’s a couple of places

HEATHER
Sorry were late

POPPY
Sorry

TEACHER
No problem - it’s very Spanish to be
late Just take your places then we
can start the class Here (She points
to a gap to which HEATHER and POPPY
go) I was just introducin’ myself to
the peoples what don’t know me Is
lovely to see you again and lovely
that you bring a friend Welcome in my
class

(She bows POPPY curtsies back - a sort of comic mock-
curtsy She exchanges a smile with a large young woman
next to her)

(HEATHER
still on
with her

the room

run The

TEACHER
So My name is Rosita Santos and I’m
comin’ from Seviglia in Spain Or
“Seville” what you say here What is
famous for our bullfighting (imitates
bull) for our beautiful oranges what
you English peoples turn into
disgusting marmalade and also is the
birth home of FLAMENCO (She strikes
a flamenco pose) So

has gestured to POPPY that her sun-glasses are
her head So POPPY now runs over to put them
bag which she has left on the other side of
She does a comic mock-unobtrusive sort of a
TEACHER unamused waits until POPPY is back

in her place)

TEACHER
Then everybody is ready I hope (She
looks pointedly at POPPY) So feet in
parallel Hip distance apart Pulling
up from the waist opening across the
chest shoulder blades drawing down to
the spine arms relaxed And taking
the head over to the right feeling
that lovely stretched-up neck

(During this POPPY accidentally catches the eye of a
defensive-looking young man just behind her She is of
course quietly amused by this)

TEACHER
Then to the left

POPPY
(whispers to HEATHER)
Not very Flamenco is it

HEATHER
(gestures)
S-sh

TEACHER
To the right Bring the head back to
the centre And relax Lovely

(POPPY does an exaggerated reaction to a twinge in her
neck)

A few minutes later

TEACHER
So guys We’re going to reverse the
abs now Thighs to the front Liftin’
up from the elbows Like they got
strings attached - like little
Pinocchio Lifting lifting Keeping
the shoulders down Arms above the
head Framing the face “Here I am”
Proud Then bringing the arms down in
front Pressing pressing pressing
Keeping the tension Keeping the
strength But fluid as well Then
lifting up again from the elbows
Like the eagle spreading his wings
Beautiful Angry Ferocious

(POPPY acts out the last three attitudes appropriately
scowling and grimacing with gusto)

TEACHER
And guysWhen you’re lifting your
eagle wings remember that this dance
comes from the pain from the
suffering of los gitanos em what you
say - the gypsies I know this word
not politically correct But these
guys they’ve been squashed down by
society for centuries centuries And
they say “We don’t need this We got
pride We got dignity We got art We
got FLAMENCO”
(Again she strikes a Flamenco pose POPPY is quietly

amused )

(POPPY enters into the spirit of it Everybody

TEACHER

They say “Thismy space”

(She

stamps her feet twice) My space

(Stamps ) My space

(Stamps) My space

(Stamps) Everybody do this One two

ALL

TEACHER

Later in the lesson POPPY is doing her best

TEACHER
Okay guys I give you two counts in
then we’re going to stamp and clap the
compas okay

(The class is arranged in two facing lines They
advance towards each other stamping and clapping
Suddenly the TEACHER breaks through the centre halting

the proceedings)

TEACHER
Guys Guys Guys What are you doing
Joder Where is the passion Where is
the revenge Where is the blood This
is Flamenco That clapping it’s so
polite It’s like the end of the
opera “Excuse me How many sugar you
want in your tea”

(The LARGE YOUNG WOMAN laughs The TEACHER points to
her and addresses HEATHER )

TEACHER
This woman has been spending every
Wednesday afternoon for a year with
your husband in a hotel in Paddington

(She points to a man and addresses another girl)

TEACHER
This guy has been having an affair for
five years with your best friend

Your boyfriend what you give your
love your spirit for five years
betrays you with a Swedish bitch what
is twenty-two years old You want to
cut off his balls

(She is distraught and covers her eyes)

TEACHER
He’s such a bastard I hate him

POPPY

(quietly)
Are you alright

(The TEACHER runs out of the hall The door slams The
class is stunned)

In a pub POPPY and HEATHER at a table are sipping
white wine

POPPY
Didnt bargain for that That was
something else wasn’t it

HEATHER
I know But all credit to her though
She picked herself up she came
straight back into the class

POPPY
As if nothing had happened Like a
little fireball wasn’t she

HEATHER
Not a grain of sentimentality

POPPY
No Wipe the tears Bless her - I just
wanted to give her a hug

HEATHER
I don’t think she’d have quite
appreciated that

POPPY
No (The TEACHERs voice) “This is my
space - get off me” Does leave a

nasty taste though doesn’t it
Exploding her heart all over the
floor

HEATHER
Then it was “put that away”

POPPY
“Stick that back in the box”

HEATHER
“Get it out another time”

POPPY
Perhaps never

HEATHER
Youll be lucky

POPPY
Yeah I know She must be going
through some shit though mustn’t
she

HEATHER
She’s actually a good teacher

POPPY
Oh yeah Definitely

HEATHER
She’s just going to burn herself out

POPPY
I believed her when she said she’d cut
off his balls though Didn’t you

HEATHER
I don’t expect the guys’1ll be back
next week then

POPPY
No Snip Snip

(She mimes big scissors They laugh)

HEATHER

POPPY

surgical stockings -

POPPY

By half-naked men in their gardens
POPPY
Oh well he was quite fit wasn’t he

SCOTT
Poppy all you have to do is keep
your eyes focussed on the road This
car is a lethal weapon If you dont

somebody Keep to the left of the
centre of the road

POPPY
Oh but come on Scott How often
d’you see a squirrel sending a text

SCOTT
Left turn Mirror signal - Enrahah
Enrahah

(POPPY mimes a squirrel sending a text - waggling its
little thumbs For a split second she has taken both
hands off the steering wheel)

SCOTT
Enrahah I can’t believe you’re a
teacher I can’t believe they’ve put
you in charge of forty children

POPPY
I know I took me by surprise to be
honest It’s thirty

of what those at the top of the
pyramid are achieving Enrahah
Enrahah

POPPY
Where are you on the pyramid

SCOTT
Me I’m outside the pyramid and I’m
looking in

POPPY

POPPY
Did you like school Scott

SCOTT
I’m afraid it didn’t agree with me

POPPY
Oh that’s a shame

SCOTT
Now let me tell you something about
the education system Poppy

POPPY
Oh go on then

SCOTT
The education system produces left-
brain prisoners D’you know what that
means

POPPY
I do actually

SCOTT
No well I’1ll tell you (POPPY
smiles) The left brain - our brain
has two sides the left brain and the
right brain The left brain - keep
going Keep going

POPPY
I’m going

SCOTT
The left brainis information data
It’s dead The right brain is
individuality It’s where the soul
lies And the education system it
works like this “I will give you a
world view”

POPPY
Right

SCOTT
“And if you repeat my world view if
you reconfirm my world view you will
pass your exams and you will go
higher and higher and higher and you
will become a policeman a magistrate
a lawyer a general a politician and
you will be happy and you will
succeed but if you think for
yourself if you think outside the
box then you will be unhappy and you
will fail” That’s how the education
system works - left turn Enrahah -
signal Enrahah

POPPY
Were you bullied at school Scott
SCOTT
You’re going to do the next left turn
Enrahah
POPPY
Kids - they can be cruel can’t they
eh

At school POPPY rushes out of the classroom into the
playground

thumping him POPPY runs over them)

POPPY

Another Flamenco lesson The class is successfully
performing a flamenco stop in unison moving across the
hall The TEACHER is clapping the rhythm and shouting
encouraging instructions (Venga Venga” And counting
“un dos tres”) POPPY is enjoying herself She is
wearing her boots and a long coloured frock They all
come to a standstill)

TEACHER

In a school corridor POPPY bustles by some kids who
are dawdling out of the main entrance

POPPY
Come on Chop-chop

(She proceeds along the corridor A woman comes out of
a room POPPY greets her then knocks on HEATHERs
door HEATHER is typing)

HEATHER

POPPY
Got a minute

HEATHER
What’s up

POPPY
We might have a problem

HEATHER
(Getting up)
Come in Sit yourself down

(POPPY sits HEATHER closes the door and joins her
They speak We observe them for a few moments through
the glazed door)

Later that afternoon POPPY walks slowly through an
attractive park Nobody is around POPPY is ina
reflective mood She stops for a while for a think

Now it’s dark POPPY is in a bleak empty inner city
street A few parked cars Somebody walks by in the
distance A male voice can be heard somewhere uttering
a strange indistinguishable chant As POPPY proceeds
the voice becomes louder She looks round Then she
stops Slowly she walks towards where the sound is
coming from

Where is she It’s an urban maybe industrial place of
some kind but it’s quite impossible to recognise
Steel girders and burning electric lights stretch into
the darkness
Suddenly POPPY comes across the chanting man He is
bearded unkempt dirty Let’s call him a TRAMP He

sits alone chanting Then he sees POPPY and stops

singing abruptly He speaks with an Irish accent

TRAMP
D’you know what I mean You know You

round of shadow boxing)

TRAMP

POPPY

against a wall or something)

POPPY
Alright What Ease up

TRAMP
S-sh

POPPY

in a corner POPPY stops)

POPPY
Oh There you go (She turns away)
Found the en suite then Shake it all
about (She looks around her) What am
I doing

(The TRAMP is coming back towards her wiping his
hands )

POPPY
All done then

(He stops a little distance away and looks at her in
wonder )

POPPY
Alright

(A train passes somewhere not too far away The TRAMP
walks past POPPY and sits down She follows him and

stands near him)

POPPY
Have you had your dinner

TRAMP
No

(POPPY sits next to him She considers for a moment
then takes some money from her bag and proceeds to put
it in his hand

POPPY
Here Take that

TRAMP
No

POPPY

Something to eat

TRAMP
No thank you

(POPPY puts the money back in her bag)

POPPY

Where are you going to sleep tonight
TRAMP

In a bed
POPPY

Oh Course you are Silly me

(She laughs Then he looks at her very intensely
Pause )

POPPY
(sensitively)

(A charged emotional moment Then he goes to touch her
face but POPPY cant help flinching slightly and he
pulls his hand away She smiles gently A moment of
connection)

TRAMP
You know

(Pause She does)

POPPY
Yeah

(Then the TRAMP gets up abruptly and scuttles off
disappearing into the darkness POPPY watches him for a
moment then she gets up puts her bag over her
shoulder and leaves stopping to give one last glance
in the TRAMP’s direction)

Now POPPY walks briskly through a very busy night-time
street Lots of people and traffic She passes a man
carrying a dog on his shoulders outside a burger bar

ZOE is on her bed reading ‘Hideous Kinky’ by Esther

SCOTT

POPPY
That’s right

SCOTT
Enrahah (He points to the mirror
then adjusts her steering) Keep to
the left of the centre of the road
You know you can make jokes while
youre driving Poppy but you will
crash and you will die laughing

POPPY
(laughing)
Well if you’re gonna go it’s the
best way to go I suppose (Pause )
Are you scared of death Scott

SCOTT

I saw
POPPY

And what did you see

SCOTT
I mean you can laugh while Rome is
burning but believe you me Poppy it
is burning and if you don’t wake up
then you will be burnt to a cinder

(POPPY looks at him reflectively)
(Pause )

SCOTT
I mean look around you - what do you
see What do you see - Do you see
happiness Do you see a policy of
bringing happiness to people No you
see ignorance and fear You see the
disease of multiculturalism And what
is multiculturalism Multiculturalism
is non-culturalism And why do they
want non-culturalism Because they
want to reduce collective will The
American Dream never happened The
American nightmare is already here I
mean look at the Washington Monument
It is five hundred and fifty-five feet
above the ground and a hundred and
eleven feet below the ground Five
hundred and fifty-five plus a hundred
and eleven is six hundred and sixty-
six Six-six-six Poppy Six-six-six
(Pause) Keep to the left of the
centre of the road

POPPY
Are you an only child Scott

SCOTT
Enrahah Use all your mirrors Watch
your speed

(Another reflective glance from Poppy)

Later The car pulls up opposite POPPY’s flat causing
a small flock of pigeons to disperse POPPY takes out
her money and gives it to SCOTT

(SCOTT drives off POPPY crosses the road to the

flat)

ZOE
Oh here’s Suzie

(SUZIE sees ZOE She smiles and makes a rude gesture)

ZOE’s little yellow car speeds out of the city At the
seaside it drives along the coast road and the
promenade past the fun-fair

Then it proceeds along a quiet modern suburban street
with neat lawns finally screeching to a halt outside a
bland semi-detached house HELEN and her husband JAMIE
appear at the door as ZOE reverses then pulls into
their driveway Much laughter and jollity from POPPY
SUZIE and ZOE inside the car

HELEN

Crowds of holiday-makers and day-trippers A fun-fair
not far away a long pier stretching out to sea

POPPY and SUZIE run along the beach wall exuberantly
ZOE HELEN and JAMIE are more subdued POPPY persuades
JAMIE to give her a piggy-back much to SUZIE’s
amusement and HELEN’s consternation But JAMIE’s back
hurts and POPPY gets off him with great concern They
all move off Two large bearded men sit on the wall

Later on the way home to London At a petrol station
ZOE is filling up SUZIE lounges on the back of the
car POPPY is a little distance away talking on her
mobile

the corner POPPY suddenly spots SCOTT standing under
a tree He is looking in the direction of their flat

speed ZOE parks outside the flat They all get out of
the car ZOE and SUZIE attend to the luggage POPPY
crosses the road to look for SCOTT But theres no sign
of him Concerned she walks back to the flat)

to revolve around you I’m a driving
instructor I just wanted to do my job
- you had no intention of learning how
to drive You got in that car with one
thing in mind to reel me in And why
Because you have to be adored - youve
got to be wanted And you drink it in
and you leave me with a spring in
your step and you go off and you
fuck your boyfriend and you fuck your
girlfriend and you all drive around
in that stupid little yellow car
