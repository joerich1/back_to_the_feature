in the manner of a man lying flat to search for a rolling
quarter under a car

Sam approaches his hand somehow drifting toward the butt

long moment at the fixed profile graven against the
pavement notices the dark blotch at the back of the
head Tentatively he reaches out lets his fingertips
touch the matted hair He brings his hand back and in

GILLESPIE
Well

There is challenge in the look - and insuiv - and something
else too (Gillespies secret knowledge that he personally
hasnt the least damn idea how to go about examining a
corpse)

then he continues out

Tibbs seems to be fighting some kind of inner war with
himself but he goes out after Gillespie

on a single slab in room center

The room is outfitted

with large stainless steel tubs shelves and cabinets

Gillespie crosses directly to the body

He almost appears

to have some idea what he is supposed to be doing but the
pretense collapses when he lifts the top edge of the sheet
stares down with obvious annoyance and bafflement et the

mystery of this untimely death

Doc lights his pipe philosophi-

Tibbs approaches the slab Gillespie sees how Ulam and the
doctor stare at the Negro It suits his mood to let it
pother them not to explain Tibbs to them just as nobody
had explained Tibbs to him and caught him in this god-damned
embarrassing position in the first place

CLOSER ANGLE - TIBBS AND THE DEAD MAN

Tibbs doesnt merely lift a corner of the sheet (as youve
geen it done all these years in movies) He folds the sheet
back all the way holds it out behind him expecting someone
to take it from him - as they do in Philadelphia at the
police morgue

But nobody moves Tibbs looks around sees the hard face of
Ulam and the interested face of the doctor Tibbs places

I wonder if you know why

As he speaks Endicott moves to the plant carefully
separates a blossom from the root structure and with tender
care begins to place it into a vase with water and a
plastic sealer

TIBBS
It would be - helpful - if you
would tell me sir

ENDICOTT

(as he works)
Because - like the Negro - they
are essentially rootless - still
searching for something to - hook
on to They need care and
cultivating and feeding - and that
takes time Thats something you
cant make some people understand -
something Mister Colpvert didnt
realize

He hands Tibbs the encapsulated orchid with a gracious
little gesture

ENDICOTT
With my compliments Mister Tibbs

Thank you sir

Tibbs reaches up casually to the wire basket from which
Endicott has taken the plant He pulls ot a bit of root

slowly rises We see that he is gripping a twofoot long
two-inch thick pine sapling He considers one end of the

discoloring the wood Then without moving the position of
his feet he looks around at the grass in the immediate area
Suddenly he hears the SOUND of someone approaching through
