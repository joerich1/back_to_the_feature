EXT FORT MAHLUS — DAY

October in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania A strong wind
snaps the flags on their flagpoles the Stars and Stripes
the state flag the US Army flag

Gunfire sounds in the distance

EXT 50 METER RANGE - DAY

Twenty young SOLDIERS fire from the prone position with their
M4 carbines

CAPTAIN SAM CAHILL (late thirties) walks down the line behind
them A pair of binoculars hangs from his neck but he doesn’t
bother to check the targets he’s watching his shooters

LIEUTENANT VINCE FREEMAN walks beside Cahill a clipboard in
his hand They speak between bursts of fire low enough that
the enlisted men can’t hear them

There is an easy rapport between the two officers they’ve
been fighting together since the first Gulf War

SAM
Ramsay closes his eyes every time
he fires
FREEMAN
Yes sir
SAM
You try to talk him out of it
FREEMAN
Yes sir Says loud noises startle
him
SAM

Loud noises startle him

FREEMAN
Yes sir

Sam glances at his lieutenant

SAM
So he volunteered for the Army

Freeman shrugs Don’t look at me

SAM
He ever hit the target

FREEMAN
It has happened sir

Sam smiles and raises his binoculars

SAM
Citizen warriors

FREEMAN
Yes sir

INT BARRACKS - DAY

The privates sit on their beds with their duffel bags and
their deployment gear laid out beside them

Lieutenant Freeman stands in the center of the room
reviewing a check list

Sam stands by the doorway looking over his soldiers Most of
them are still teenagers skinny boys with shaved heads

FREEMAN
If you do not have any of the items
I call off put your hand in the
air Two Kevlar covers One cap
cold weather Two BDU coats cold
weather One BDU top cold weather
Two BDU trousers cold weather One
pair boots cold weather Three
pair IcW gloves One glove insert
Two balaclavas

Freeman looks up He sees the general confusion He steps
over to the nearest bed grabs a balaclava from the private’s
gear and holds it in the air

FREEMAN
Balaclava

Sam smiles and checks his watch

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

Sam and Freeman walk through the base’s parking lot in their
civvies Now that they’re away from their men and out of
uniform their interaction is less formal no more sirs

SaM
Give ‘em a few months over there
they’1l1 be okay

FREEMAN
Long as the Taliban don’t make any
loud noises
(beat)
Tommy’s out today

SAM
I got to pick him up

FREEMAN
He make it through okay

Sam fishes for his car keys

SAM
He made it through

EXT MAHLUS TOWNSHIP - DAY

An old Jeep Cherokee Briarwood a ‘91 with wood side panels
cruises through town passing houses of red brick and white-
painted aluminum siding

Almost every house has Old Glory flying from a flag mount on
the porch Yellow ribbons are everywhere tied around tree
branches tacked onto the front doors in stickers on the
rear windows of parked cars

Mahlus hasn’t changed much since the Fifties The locals
aren’t wealthy but their yards are tidy the grass mowed the
leaves raked

INT JEEP - DAY
GRACE CAHILL drives her two daughters MAGGIE and
ISABELLE Isabelle sits up front with Mom She has a big

Band-Aid on her elbow

Grace will be lovely by the afternoon but she doesn’t look
entirely awake yet

MAGGIB
Why coconut

GRACE
It’s Uncle Tommy’s favorite

MAGGIE
I hate coconut

ISABELLE
Shes not making it for you

Maggie irritated about the whole thing stares out the
window at the Mahlus main drag a roadside strip that could
be Anywhere Americas Dairy Queen Wendy’s the Pep Boys

MAGGIE
Is it his birthday

GRACE
Nope

MAGGIE
So why’s he get a cake

Grace hesitates as she turns into the supermarket lot

GRACE
It’s a big day

Isabelle glances at her mother but doesn’t say a word She
knows what’s what but there’s no point explaining anything
to Maggie

MAGGIE
I don’t remember him

Grace waits for a car to pull out of a parking space

GRACE
You were very little the last time
you saw him

ISABELLE
I remember him He gave me his
baseball glove when he went away

Grace sighs watching as the OLD LADY in the parking space
takes forever getting her car out

GRACE
I forgot about that Did you ever
use it

ISABELLE

It doesn’t fit

GRACE
Well it was nice of him anyway

She peers through the windshield at the old lady who seems
unsure which way to turn the wheel

GRACE
I think this lady’s having a stroke
or something

ISABELLE
Baseballs boring

GRACE

T know sweetie Maybe don’t tell
Uncle Tommy that

EXT MID-STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

Sam parks in the Lot behind the prison The watchtower looms
above the grim brick buildings

He’s driving a ‘68 Mustang fully restored to its original
beauty
INT MID-STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

Sam approaches the uniformed RECEPTIONIST who sits behind
bullet-proof glass like a bank teller in a bad neighborhood

In the background sitting on a bench reading a magazine
TOMMY CAHILL (early thirties) looks up and sees his big
brother on the far side of the glass He grins and stands
holding a small rucksack

Tommy hasn’t shaved in a few weeks He looks like he needs a
good shower and some sleep

SAM
(to receptionist)
I’m here for Thomas Cahill

The receptionist nods and passes a clipboard under the glass
into the deal tray Sam signs his name to the release papers
and smiles at his kid brother

The receptionist presses a button beneath her desk unlocking
the door

i

i
i
a

After a moment she realizes Tommy hasn’t moved She turns
and looks at him

RECEPTIONIST
Whenever you’re ready

Tommy isn’t used to being able to walk through a door without
permission He blinks and hurries through before the offer is
rescinded

The brothers embrace They haven’t been on the same side of
bulletproof glass in three years

When they step back Sam examines his kid brother

TOMMY
What

SAM
(re the beard)
You doing the Charles Manson thing

TOMMY
(rubbing his scruff)
Pretty good right

SAM
Yeah you’‘re beautiful

They turn and walk out of the reception area Tommy glances
back at the receptionist gives a little wave the last
person he’ll see in the prison but she’s filling out forms

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY
The brothers stand beside the Mustang

TOMMY
Jesus
(in awe of the car)
How long did that take

SAM
Year and a half

TOMMY
V8

SAM
What do you think

TOMMY
Chrome quads

He checks for himself sees the dual exhaust with the four
chrome pipes

TOMMY
Goddamn
(beat)
You do this just to piss me off

SAM
Pretty much

Tommy reaches for the keys

TOMMY
Let me drive

Sam laughs and pushes his kid brother toward the passenger
side

EXT MAHLUS BACKROADS - DAY

The Mustang cruises down a quiet road on the outskirts of
Mahlus

INT MUSTANG — DAY

Bruce Springsteen plays Tommy taps the windowsill to the
song’s beat

TOMMY
You always drive thirty-five

Sam smiles but doesn’t say anything

TOMMY
This car’‘s wasted on you you know
that

The words have no effect Tommy’s been goading Sam for thirty
years It’s like the hum of an air conditioner background
noise

Tommy stares out the window at the fringes of his hometown A
sudden realization creases his brow He leans forward to
inspect the dash

TOMMY
What is that
SAM
What
TOMMY

You put in a CD player

SAM
(defensive)
Yeah

TOMMY
(incredulous pause)
You put a CD player in a ‘68
Mustang

SAM
What’s your problem

TOMMY
What’s my problem It’s not right
It’s a 1968 vintage car You don’t
put in a CD player

SAM
It’s not right huh

Sam is amused by Tommy’s indignation which just makes Tommy
more annoyed

TOMMY
No it’s not right

SAM
You know so much about what’s
right why’d I just pick you up
from the state prison

Tommy is silent staring at his brother

TOMMY
Fuck you
(beat)
Can I smoke at least Can I smoke
in your fucking ‘68 Mustang that
has a CD player and doesn’t go
faster than thirty-five

SAM
Smoke

TOMMY
Thank you

He rolls down a window and lights a cigarette

TOMMY
So there’s dinner tonight

SAM
Last I heard Mom couldn’t decide
if she should make lamb chops for
you because you’re out or meat
loaf for me ‘cause I’m going away
in a week

TOMMY
Youre going away in a week
(off Sam’s nod)
I didn’t know that
(beat)
I don’t even like Lamb chops

SAM
Her meat loaf’s pretty bad too

TOMMY
Jesus

At a stop sign Sam reaches into his pocket pulls out a
business card and hands it to Tommy He continues driving

SAM
There’s something you might want to
think about doing I mean when
you have time

Tommy stares at the card A woman’s name A bank branch

TOMMY
What is this

SAM
It’s the woman you assaulted

TOMMY
I know that Why are you giving me
the fucking card

SAM
She’s back at her branch in Cherry
Hills

10

TOMMY
I don’t give a shit Where the hell
did you get her card

SAM
Ive spoken to her a couple times

Tommy glares at his brother in disbelief

SAM
I was embarrassed I apologized on
your behalf For the family It was
a couple months ago

TOMMY
You what Who the fuck do you
think you are

SAM
She couldn’t go to work for six
months because she was afraid you’d
come back You destroyed her life
I think you could help her if you
went back there--

TOMMY
What kind of crap is that What’s
wrong with you man

SAM
It’s the decent thing to do

Tommy shakes his head and yanks hard on the hand brake

EXT MAHLUS BACKROADS -— CONTINUOUS

The Mustang squeals to a stop Tommy steps out of the car
grabs his rucksack from behind the seat and walks off the
road crossing through the woods that border the town

SAM
Hey Come on man get back in the
car Tommy

A pickup truck driving in the same direction slows down to go
around Sam’s Mustang The DRIVER shouts at Sam as he passes

DRIVER
You can’t park there asshole

ll

Sam locks eyes with the driver He doesn’t say a word or
narrow his eyes or flip the guy off but all the same--— the
driver shuts his mouth and zooms away

Sam turns and watches his brother stomp off into the woods

daughter’s arm inspecting the Band-Aid

ISABELLE
Wait wait Not yet

She stares at the Band-Aid terrified of the coming pain

ISABELLE
Let’s count to ten

SAM
Okay One two--

ISABELLE

SAM

As Sam counts he looks at the wall behind Isabelle where her
posters of ice skaters hang

SAM
Three is that a new poster

Isabelle turns to look at the poster With one quick motion
Sam peels the Band-Aid off Isabelle’s elbow

She yelps more in surprise than pain

ISABELLE
Dad That hurt

SAM

already over

He scoops her up in his arms and carries her to the door She
clings to his neck

SAM
Let’s get Mom to clean it up

INT CAHILL KITCHEN - NIGHT
Grace and ELSIE CAHILL Sam and Tommy’s mother stand by the

oven Maggie and Isabelle sit at the breakfast table playing
Connect Four with their grandfather HANK

The kitchen itself is unfinished the cabinets lacking their
doors the tilework undone

14

Elsie pulls a meat loaf out of the oven and rests it on the
kitchen counter beside a platter of overcooked lamb chops

ELSIE
The trick is using lots of mustard
It keeps the meat from drying out

Grace eyes the meat loaf It doesn’t look so tempting

GRACE
Mustard okay

ELSTE
Lets just put some foil on it
keep it warm

She looks around for tin foil Grace grabs a box from atop
the refrigerator tears out a sheet and covers the plate

ELSIE
When are you finishing the kitchen
GRACE
Sam wanted to get it done before he
left but

(looking around)
I don’t think it’s gonna happen

ELSIE
He takes on too much He always
has
ISABELLE
(to Hank)

You’re trapped
Hank studies the board He slips a black piece into its slot

HANK
No I’m not

ISABELLE
Yes you are

She inserts a red piece and connects four diagonally

HANK
Look at that

ISABELLE

time

Grace looks at Sam She doesn’t believe him
SAM

The girls aren’t even hungry yet
Are you

ISABELLE
Yes I am

MAGGIE
Me too

Hank stands Hes a big man still powerfully built but his
knees are bad and standing is a chore

HANK
All right come on We can’t let
the children die of hunger just
‘cause Tommy can’t keep a date
He’s probably already back in
prison for Christ’s sake

Grace smiles at the joke Elsie does not The doorbell rings
SAM

There he is

INT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Sam opens the front door Tommy stands there holding a
pathetic bouquet of flowers

SAM
You taking me to the prom
(off Tommy’s silence)
Look I’m sorry It wasn’t my
place

Tommy steps inside

TOMMY
Shithead
(beat)
Sorry I’m late I thought I knew a
short cut

The brothers walk toward the dining room Elsie comes into
the hallway She smiles when she sees her baby He gives her
a hug and a kiss She runs her hand down his bearded jaw

ELSIE
Youre so thin

TOMMY
You kidding I’m solid muscle

ELSIE
You’re skin and bones It’s a good
thing I made so many lamb chops

TOMMY
No way Are we having lamb
chops

ELSIE

favorite

Grace steps out of the kitchen She smiles at Tommy but it’s
clear these two aren’t close He gives her a little hug and
hands her the crappy bouquet

GRACE
Thanks

TOMMY
They’re from the Shell station

Hank limps out from the kitchen followed by the two girls

HANK
You pay for them

TOMMY
Hey Dad

The two men shake hands There is little warmth here

Tommy sees the two girls staring up at him nervously Maggie
clutches some of the fabric from Hank’s pants Tommy has
absolutely no idea what to say to them

19

TOMMY
He’s giving me that look he always
gives me Look I’m sorry I was
away I’m sorry he’s going away--

HANK
He’s going to do his job There’s a
difference between rebuilding a
nation and sitting in a cell

TOMMY
Rebuilding a nation You kidding
me All they do is run around
shooting anything that moves
Didn’t you guys blow up a wedding a
couple weeks ago

SAM
That was the Marines
TOMMY
Whats the difference
SAM
I’m not in the Marines is one
difference
ISABELLE
(angry)
They only shoot the bad guys
TOMMY
Who tells them which ones are the

bad guys

Grace is irritated with Tommy for upsetting her daughter She
gives him a look before speaking to Isabelle

GRACE
They only shoot the bad guys

Sam dishes out more green beans for Maggie who makes a face
SAM

Maybe we get lucky and don’t shoot
anybody

INT MUSTANG - NIGHT

Sam drives Tommy through the quiet streets of Mahlus

SAM

comfortable

TOMMY
Yeah I don’t think so man Don’t

(beat)
Moms starting to look old

SAM

The brothers travel in silence for a moment listening to the
music on the anachronistic CD player

SAM
So what about you Any plans

TOMMY
Wow you waited four hours to ask
me I think that’s a record

SAM
Remember Jonas played ball with me
in high school He’s got a demo

of a douchebag wasn’t he

SAM
Yeah he’s offering you a job you
know You don’t want it don’t take

TOMMY
All right man take it easy I’1l

The muscles in Sam’s jaw work as he watches the road For a
few seconds he says nothing

TOMMY
What
SAM
Just can you try to stay out of

trouble for the next six months
(MORE)

2l

SAM (contd)
It would be nice to see you when I
get home

Tommy watches the road unrolling before them in the
headlights He’s not angry at his brother or mocking him or
anything but stating the facts

TOMMY
Six months is a long time

INT PHELAN’S BAR AND GRILL - DAY

Tommy steps inside the warm buttery light of the bar
Phelan’s has been serving the drinkers of Mahlus for forty
years The walls are covered with photographs of the Mahlus
High football teams of uniformed locals who have died in
overseas conflicts of regional celebrities

A roar of welcome rises when everyone sees Tommy He’s been
away a long time and the BAR PATRONS are happy to see him

He smiles and begins shaking hands happy to be home

EXT FORT MAHLUS - DAWN

Two PRIVATES unfold the American flag hook it to the flag
pole pulleys and slowly raise it

The fort’s BUGLER wipes his trumpet’s mouthpiece and plays

INT BARRACKS - DAY
Sam and Lt Freeman stand in front of the enlisted men

SAM
We leave in twenty-four hours This
will be the last time I talk to you
on American soil

Sam speaks with calm assured cadences

The boys staring up at him are painfully young They must be
deeply nervous about what lies ahead but they listen to
their commander with the faith a devout congregation bestows
on a beloved pastor

SAM
I know some of you think we’re
going to a different world
tomorrow

(MORE)

SAM (contd)

Well Lieutenant Freeman and I have
served two tours over there and
let me assure you the sun still
rises in the east water still runs
downhill and you’re just as ugly
in Afghanistan as you are here

The soldiers’ young faces are scribbled with acne a few of
them chew nervously on their fingernails but they smile

SAM

Weve been there and back and so
will you Keep your weapons clean
follow your orders and do not
forget that everywhere you walk you
represent our country That flag on
your shoulder says you are an
American soldier-- that is an honor
and that is a responsibility

(beat)
Tf any of you have any doubt about
whether we’re doing the right
thing wait till you’re standing
there ‘Cause people can talk about
it all they want on the TV it

middle of it And I promise you

Sam makes eye contact with several of his men

friends (AJ OWEN and SWEENEY) lurches to his feet

TOMMY
My round
SWEENEY
Wait a second What have you done

with Tommy Cahill

OWEN
Hey hey don’t give him second
thoughts I been waiting my whole
life for Tommy to buy a round

TOMMY
You’re all sluts and ingrates and
it’s your luck I don’t drink alone

He weaves through the crowd somewhat graceful despite the
many drinks in his belly

At the bar he sees a fetching young BRUNETTE with blue eyes
He slides up to her and smiles It’s not much of a move but
his smile is tough to beat

TOMMY
Have you missed me

BRUNETTE
Have you been away

TOMMY
I’ve been away a long time And
it’s been lonesome

BRUNETTE
Tt’s been lonesome What are you a
country singer

She was between me and the
bartender

BOYFRIEND

The brunette tugs on her boyfriend’s arm

BRUNETTE

BARTENDER

BARTENDER
I want you out of here

Tommy can’t even believe what a betrayal this is
TOMMY

You kidding me You’ve known me my
whole life

BARTENDER
That‘s why I’m asking you to leave

For a moment Tommy considers escalating this thing to a whole
new level but fuck it no one’s on his side not even his
friends who have stayed seated at their corner table

TOMMY
Yeah yeah yeah

Everyone watches him walk away He stops at the door and
points at the brunette

TOMMY
Despite everything I’m pretty sure
you like me

He heads out into the cold night The brunette shrugs
glances at her boyfriend and sips her beer

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

laughs fighting back and Maggie comes to the rescue

He puts it aside As she finishes brushing her teeth he
stands behind her runs his hands under her shirt up the
skin of her back holds her breasts in his palms

She turns toward him sticks out her tongue white with
Crest Sam grins and kisses her

Grace tosses the toothbrush into the sink and puts her hands
on her husband pulling off his shirt

Working all day in my daddys garage
Driving all night chasing some mirage
Pretty soon little girl I‘m gonna take charge

EXT ROADS OF AFGHANISTAN - DAY
A US Army convoy hurtles down the newly paved highway

Mister I aint a boy no Im a man
And I believe in a promised land

Sam sits in the passenger seat of a Humvee staring across
the arid landscape at the distant snow-capped mountains
EXT ARMY BASE - DAY

The vehicles of the convoy negotiate the tortuous anti-car
bomber entrance to the sprawling base

SOLDIERS wearing full body armor and sunglasses manning
heavy machine guns mounted behind walls of sandbags watch
the newcomers with no expression and no sign of welcome

EXT HELIPAD - DAY

A Blackhawk lands Sam stands at a safe distance the wind
from the rotor blades fanning his hair

MAJOR CAVAZOS steps off the helicopter followed by several
AIDES He sees Sam waiting for him grins and beckons for
the younger officer to join him

Cavazos and Sam talk as they walk voices raised over the
roar of the helicopter

SAM
Thought you were out of here

CAVAZOS
Two more days Could have used you
in the football game last week
Those cocksuckers from Bagram

Sam nods Cavazos slaps him on the shoulder

CAVAZOS
Welcome home

EXT WATCHTOWER - LATER

Sam paces along the parapet of the high tower passing
sentries with binoculars who watch over the hills and ridges
abutting the base

He’s carrying a satellite phone and he’s trying to find the
spot with the best connection

INT MALL — DAY

Grace stands in front of a plate glass shop window staring
at a bald mannequin in an expensive outfit The mannequin
stares back painted blue eyes behind long lashes

A sign on the window says EVERYTHING MUST GO

Isabelle stands beside her mother Maggie wears a candy

bracelet she sloppily tries to chew one of the candies off
while asking questions
30

MAGGIE
Why is she bald

GRACE
Hm

Maggie points at the bald mannequin

GRACE
I don’t know sweetheart

Grace reaches into her handbag pulls out a tissue and wipes
the pink sugar off Maggie’s chin Grace’s cell phone buzzes

She gestures for Isabelle to hold Maggie’s hand which the
older sister reluctantly does

Grace steps a few feet away covering her free ear to hear
better

Sam feints a right cross at the grinning young sentry and
heads down the tower stairs
EXT SKIES OF AFGHANISTAN - DUSK

A Blackhawk flies through the darkening sky running lights
extinguished for maximum stealth

INT BLACKHAWK DUSK
The cabin is lit only by the muted red night lights

Sam and Lieutenant Freeman sit with a squad of twelve young
SOLDIERS Some of the men are visibly nervous others appear
relaxed a few are cocky

Sam studies the photograph of Joe Willis

MORELLA
There must be some hookers around
IT can’t not fuck for six months
just ‘cause they’re Muslims

FREEMAN
Morella

MORELLA
That’s like prejudiced

FREEMAN
Morella You don’t quit the redneck

your problems

MORELLA
Redneck I grew up twenty minutes
from the City

FREEMAN
That’s redneck to me Shut your
mouth

MORELLA

I’m just saying you officers are
all married it’s easy for you

FREEMAN
You wanted hookers you should have
joined the Navy

Sam smiles at this slipping the photograph of Willis back
into a pocket of his jacket

A flash of intense light and an eardrum-shattering explosion

The Blackhawk lurches to the side as smoke begins to fill the
cabin

The soldiers all look to Sam Sam and Freeman look into the
cockpit where the pilots are desperately trying to keep the
bird aloft while radioing for help

PILOT
Were hit Taking RPG fire

CO-PILOT
Mayday Mayday Mayday Witchdoctor
8 going down Witchdoctor 8 going
down

The helicopter enters into a sickening plunge Most of the
soldiers have their eyes closed gripping the bench beneath
them as the Blackhawk plummets

Sam looks through the cockpit’s windshield as the dark
hillside rushes up to meet them

EXT SKIES OF AFGHANISTAN - DUSK

Viewed from far away the spectacle has a strange solemn
beauty The burning helicopter silently tumbles from the
evening sky

The Blackhawk smashes into the ground rotor blades scything
the rocks and shattering The fuel tank explodes sending
flaming gouts of fuel into the air

The helicopter burns on the hillside a bonfire of mangled
steel No one inside could have survived

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Grace lies in the bathtub Her eyes are closed and steam
rises from the water She opens her eyes when she hears the
doorbell

INT FOYER - NIGHT

Isabelle and Maggie run to the front door Isabelle gets on
her tip-toes and looks through the peep hole

ISABELLE
Who is it

SANDERSON (0S)
It’s ah Lieutenant Sanderson and
Lieutenant Davis

34

Isabelle opens the door SANDERSON and DAVIS stand with their
hats in their hands

ISABELLE
What do you want

SANDERSON
Is your mother home

ISABELLE
She’s in the bath

Grace appears wearing a bathrobe her hair tied back with a
rubber band

She sees the officers and she knows
She baits the girls gently toward the living room
GRACE

Igzie you and Maggie go to the
living room You can watch TV

Isabelle understands that something is not right Maggie of
course is oblivious

MAGGIE
I thought we’‘re not allowed to
watch after eight

GRACE
Tonight it’s okay
(nodding to Isabelle)
Go ahead sweetie

Isabelle takes Maggie by the hand and leads her out of sight
Grace turns and faces the officers She would rather not
exist than stand here at this moment but she faces the

officers and waits

Sanderson opens his mouth to speak but this is difficult
Maybe he’s never done it before He takes a deep breath

Grace watches the young officer and waits for him to find the
right words

INT LIVING ROOM -—- LATER

Grace lies on the sofa with her girls On the television a
cartoon princess runs through a cartoon forest

35

Maggie sleeps her head in Grace’s lap Isabelle still
watches the television but her eyelids are getting heavy

Grace plays with Maggie’s hair

INT GIRLS’ BEDROOM - LATER

The girls sleep in their beds Grace sits on the floor beside
Isabelle’s bed her back against the night table

Headlights splash through the bedroom curtains Grace slowly

looks toward the window as she hears the car pulling into the
driveway

EXT CAHILL HOUSE - NIGHT

Tommy has parked the ‘68 Mustang He lurches out of the car
empties an ashtray full of cigarette butts in a bush and
replaces the ashtray in the car door

He walks toward the garage holding the car keys

Grace opens the front door Tommy stops in midstride caught
in the act For a second he considers making a run for it
but then he holds up his hands and gives his best smile

TOMMY
Okay okay I know

Grace stares at him in disbelief

TOMMY
Ah he said it was okay he said if
I wanted to borrow it--

He walks over to Grace still grinning

TOMMY
You don’t want the battery going
dead so-- I think one of the turn
signals is broken I could test it
if you want

GRACE
Are you drunk Are you driving
around drunk in our car

TOMMY
Okay let’s not-- Don‘t make this
into a big thing

(MORE)

TOMMY (contd)
(beat)
What are you doing up

GRACE
Did you talk to your mom and dad

Tommy makes a face

TOMMY
Uh not since I dropped out of high
school But that was a really good
chat That one went really well

He sees that Grace is still staring at him

TOMMY
Hey hold on hold on Sam pretty
much lent me the car Okay So
don’t stand there giving me that
pissed-off look

He looks around the driveway

TOMMY
Now I got to get home ‘cause
you’ll notice you’1ll notice I
dropped the car off at your place

even though now I got to I’1l
just walk It’s only a couple
miles

GRACE

Sams dead

Tommy looks at her The sentence she just spoke makes no
sense in the context of their conversation He waits for her

to admit that she just made a very bad joke

Finally it becomes clear that Grace will say no such thing
For the first time he notices that her eyes are red-rimmed

and glassy

TOMMY
What

GRACE
They crashed

Grace watches him Maybe she’s curious to see how someone
else will react to these words she heard a few hours ago

TOMMY
Wait
(almost angry now)
»»swhat are you telling me

GRACE
He’s dead Tommy
(beat)
Do you want to come in
TOMMY
No I don’t want to come in
(beat)
What is this I come here to drop
off
(beat)

Why didn’t you call me Why didn’t
anyone call me

GRACE
Weve been trying to reach you all
night

Tommy stares at her for another long beat

He turns and walks away At the end of the driveway he turns
and hurls the car keys at Grace She flinches and they hit

the wall beside her

Tommy walks off into the night

EXT HANK AND ELSIE’S HOUSE NIGHT

Tommy stands on the sidewalk staring at the little house
with aluminum siding where he grew up Inside the lights are

blazing

Tommy seems undecided whether or not he wants to be here

Finally he walks up the brick path to the front porch

EXT HANK AND ELSTE’S PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Hank opens the door and looks at his son He holds a glass of

whiskey on ice It’s not his first

aluminum sheet locks up and sees her son watching her

ELSIE
Hi Tommy
TOMMY
Hi Mom

ELSIE

TOMMY

ELSIE
Yes sweetheart

Tommy watches his mother form perfect little spheres of
cookie dough which she carefully spaces on the sheet

TOMMY
Sam’s dead

Elsie nods Her eyes fill with tears

ELSIE
Yes he is

Tommy walks over to her and gathers her in his arms She
cries softly her eyes clenched shut as Tommy holds her

Hank stands and leaves the room with his drink

INT CAHILL HOUSE - DAY

Grace wearing a dark simple dress roams through the house
straightening furniture and picking up stray crayons She’s
getting the place ready for guests

GRACE

She heads toward her daughters’ room stopping to scoop a
pair of bumblebee-striped ear muffs off the floor

GRACE
Isabelle Maggie You girls ready
INT GIRLS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Grace walks into their bedroom She stops when she sees

Isabelle lying in bed reading a paperback novel wearing her
jeans and a hooded sweatshirt

GRACE
Where’s your dress

Isabelle never looks up from her book

ISABELLE
It’s ugly

Grace examines her daughter for a second She walks over to
the closet pulls out the dress and tosses it on Isabelle

GRACE
(stern)
Put it on We have to go

ISABELLE
I don’t want to

Mother and daughter stare at each other Maggie sits down on
the bed beside her big sister She’s already wearing her
little black-and-white dress

MAGGIE
Then I don’t want to wear mine
either It’s itchy

Grace stares down at her two rebellious daughters After a
moment the stern expression fades from her face

40

She sits on the bed touches Isabelle’s cheek and gently
pulls the girl to her At first Isabelle is reluctant to sit
up

GRACE
Come here

Isabelle allows Grace to pull her close to kiss her and
stroke her hair

MAGGIE
Is Daddy really dead like your mom
and dad

GRACE
Yes

Maggie plays with the folds in the bedspread

MAGGIE
I don’t want to wear this crappy
dress

Grace smiles still holding Isabelle

INT CHURCH - DAY

The small church is filled with Sam’s FRIENDS and FAMILY
singing the old hymn as sunlight streams through the tall
windows Half the attendees are Army men in uniform

Abide with me fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the heipless O abide with me

Isabelle and Maggie wearing sweatshirts and jeans sit on
either side of Grace Isabelle sobs and Grace turns to her
kissing her hair whispering in her ear

Beside Maggie Hank sits with Elsie holding her hand very
tight singing the words a great weariness behind his eyes

Tommy sits on the other side of Elsie He wears a tie though
he’s made 4 mess of the knot He looks as though he hasn’t
slept since hearing the news

Maggie climbs into Hank’s lap and he musses the girl’s hair
4l

Come not in terrors as the King of Kings
But kind and good with healing in Thy wings
fears for all woes a heart for every plea
Come Friend of sinners thus abide with me

EXT CHURCH -— DAY

Grace walks out of the church with Elsie the two women
holding hands Other mourners stream out behind them

CAVAZOS
Grace
(to Elsie)
Mrs Cahill

Elsie smiles at the major but she doesn’t recognize him and
she doesn’t really want to speak with him She gathers the
girls and walks toward the parking lot with them

GRACE
Hey

Cavazos manages to maintain eye contact with Grace for about
two seconds before he focuses on the pavement by his feet
He’s a war-hardened veteran but this is not in his skill set

CAVAZOS
He was the best officer I had Just
a fine fine soldier
(awkward beat)
And I want you to know if there’s
anything I can do

Grace nods Both of them know it’s a pointless offer but it’s
part of the funeral etiquette

Grace watches the mourners heading to their cars Cavazos
stands beside her stiff and silent

GRACE
I knew this could happen I mean
we talked about it You know what
to do money and stuff

CAVAZOS
You should be getting the death
gratuity in a couple weeks

She shakes her head eyes closed trying to dispel the words

42

CAVAZOS
It’s the uh the technical term
for it Pretty stupid way of

putting it you’re right

GRACE

No it’s we talked about it And
you think about it all the time
It’s just

(Looking into his eyes)
I don’t believe he’s dead I can’t
feel it Don’t you think I’d feel
it if he were dead

Grace searches Cavazos’ face for some kind of answer

CAVAZOS
The bodies were

He stops realizing what he’s about to say

CAVAZOS
They did the DNA tests Every man
on that chopper is gone

Grace looks away

GRACE

You start thinking if you worry
about something enough it won’t
happen ‘Cause the bad things that
happen they always surprise you
don‘t they So I worried about it
every hour every minute and look
where we are It still happened

EXT CHURCH PARKING LOT DAY

Hank walks toward his car sipping whiskey from his hip
flask Elsie and the girls follow behind

his father drinking

TOMMY

The girls pile into the backseat Hank closes the door Tommy
reaches for the keys and Hank pushes his hand away

TOMMY

HANK

HANK
(to Tommy)
Tell you what why don’t you find

and buy your own car All right
And you can drive it whenever the
hell you want

TOMMY
Can’t you stop being an asshole for
one day

Hank steps closer to Tommy eyes fierce with anger For a
moment it seems the confrontation might get physical

Elsie takes her husband’s arm and tries to tug him away

ELSIE
Hank

Never taking his eyes off Tommy Hank points at the church

HANK
You hear those men in there talking
about your brother Did you Who
the hell’s gonna stand up for you

TOMMY

instead he turns and walks away

ELSIE
Tommy Tommy

Tommy is not coming back Elsie wheels on her husband

ELSIE
What is wrong with you

HANK
He’s out of prison two weeks and
he’s giving me a lecture

ELSIE
Give me the keys

HANK
Don’t you start on me--

ELSIE
Give me the goddamn keys

Weve never seen this look on Elsie’s face before Maybe Hank
hasn’t either He hands over the keys and turns away from
her muttering to himself

HANK
What the hell is wrong with
everybody

He opens the backseat

HANK
Come on scoot over make room for
Grandpa

Elsie watches him close the door Grace has walked up to the
passenger door The two women exchange a look

a
Hi

EXT GRAVEYARD - DAY

The crowd of MOURNERS encircles a flag-draped casket waiting
to be interred The Army HONOR GUARD stands at attention
while an ARMY CHAPLAIN reads the benediction

ARMY CHAPLAIN
Blessed are the pure in heart for
they shall see God

Maggie sees a beetle crawling through the grass near her
feet She tries to stomp it Isabelle gives her a look and
Maggie gives up watching the lucky beetle make its escape

ARMY CHAPLAIN
Blessed are the peacemakers for
they shall be called the sons of
God

The dozens of gathered soldiers stand with heads bowed
listening to the ancient blessing

ARMY CHAPLAIN
Blessed are those who are
persecuted because of
righteousness for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven

Grace stands beside her daughters with Hank and Elsie close
by Tommy is nowhere in sight

The chaplain closes his Bible and nods to the NCOIC (non-
commissioned officer in charge) who presents arms

The seven members of the honor guard raise their rifles in
unison and fire three volleys

Following the last volley the BUGLER begins playing taps
Two members of the honor guard carefully remove Old Glory
from the casket and fold it with great precision

When the flag is properly folded the NCOTC hands it to the
chaplain who in turn hands it to Grace

She nods in thanks Everyone gathered around the grave
watches Grace now and she looks down at the flag unsure
what to do with it

INT PHELAN’S BAR AND GRILL - DAY

Tommy walks into the bar (the same one he was thrown out of a
few nights ago) The place is empty now early in the
afternoon save for a MIDDLE-AGED DRINKER doing a crossword

The bartender from the earlier scene dries glasses with a
dish towel He gives Tommy a look

Tommy throws up his hands in surrender

TOMMY
Either you let me back or I got to
start drinking at the fucking
yuppie bar in the mall

The bartender gives the smallest possible smile He sets a
clean glass down on the bar Tommy sits and the bartender
pours him a glass of good bourbon

BARTENDER
On the house

Tommy’s just happy to be welcome again he wasn’t expecting
free liquor

BARTENDER
Im sorry about your brother

Tommy nods and studies the bourbon no longer so excited
about the prospect of drinking it
EXT GRAVEYARD - DAY

The mourners walk to the parking lot Hank stops in the
middle of the cemetery and stares back at his son’s grave

A solitary SOLDIER in dress uniform stands at attention per
Army ritual as the GRAVEDIGGERS shovel dirt into the grave

Hank looks at the lone sentry for a long count before turning
away
EXT HILLSIDE AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT

The wreckage of the Blackhawk burns lighting the hillside
Only moments have passed since the helicopter hit the ground

47

Ammunition inside the Blackhawk begins cooking off crackling
like popcorn in the microwave

The force of the impact has thrown Sam’s body clear of the
crash site He lies in a gully thirty feet from the
helicopter bleeding from a nasty head wound

The barrel of an AK-47 prods him in the ribcage

TALIBAN FIGHTERS surround the fallen American murmuring to
each other in Pashtu Most look to be about twenty years old
their beards still sparse and patchy

The oldest of the fighters KOUSHAN kneels beside Sam
and slaps his face Sam reacts to the blow-- he’s unconscious
but very much alive

The fighters murmur with excitement This has been a wildly
successful night They’ve shot down an American chopper and
captured an American officer

They pat him down quickly stripping him of his combat knife
his canteen and all other personal items including the
photo of Joe Willis and the pregnant shot of Grace

Four of the fighters grab Sam by the arms and legs and haul
him roughly to the bed of a pickup truck

EXT DIRT ROAD AFGHANISTAN - DAWN

The pickup truck rumbles down a road that’s little more than
a goat path through the scrub brush and scree

Sam sits in the back hands lashed together watched
carefully by four young fighters He has regained
consciousness and blinks with pain at each jolt in the road

Blood still leaks from the gash in his scalp dripping down
the side of his face

One of the young Taliban fighters gestures at Sam and says
something in Pashtu Whatever he said must have been funny
the other fighters laugh at their captive

Sam watches as the day’s first light brightens the eastern
horizon

EXT GUERILLA CAMP - DAWN

The fighters drive into the camp shouting and brandishing
their rifles They are greeted by more comrades who gather
around the truck staring at the prisoner with a mix of
curiosity anger and contempt

Sam is shoved out of the truck and led to a squat cinderblock
bunker with a corrugated steel roof

INT BUNKER - DAWN

The Taliban men push Sam into this dirt-floored cell close
the door and bolt it from the outside

He looks around eyes adjusting to the dim Light dribbling in
through gaps between the roof and the walls

Only after a few seconds does Sam realize he’s not alone in
the cell A very pale very young American soldier sits in
the corner arms wrapped around his knees shivering

Sam walks closer and crouches beside the other prisoner He
recognizes the boy’s face

SAM
Joe Willis

The soldier stares up at Sam plainly terrified He has not
had a sip of water in over a day his lips are dry and
cracked After a moment’s hesitation he nods

SAM
Im Captain Sam Cahill
(slow smile)
I‘m here to get you out

If Sam hoped the kid would respond to the attempt at humor
he was overly optimistic He studies the boy’s bruised face

SAM
Are you okay Did they hurt you

Willis lowers his head His eyes are swollen and red from
erying He looks more like a terrified child than a trained
soldier

Sam takes all this in Whatever lies ahead Joe Willis will
not be much help but Sam gives a brave smile and puts his
hand on the boy’s shoulder

49

SAM
You’re not alone anymore

Willis gives a very small nod Sam sits beside Willis back
against the wall The prisoners’ breath rises in vapors in
the cold morning air

INT CAHILL HOUSE NIGHT

Grace irons Maggie’s itchy black-and-white dress When she’s
done she folds it neatly and pulls another item from the
basket of clean laundry It’s one of Sam’s dress shirts

She hesitates when she realizes what she’s holding After a
moment she lays the shirt down on the board and begins
ironing it

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Grace lies in bed with her sleeping daughters on either side
of her The television is on with the sound muted

The TV’s blue light plays across her face but Grace isn’t
watching the movie Her mind is thousands of miles away

INT YUPPIE BAR - NIGHT
Tommy sits at one end of the bar He is deep in his cups

Unlike Phelan’s the yuppie bar has no sawdust on the floor
no names gouged into the veneer walls and no pickled eggs
for sale On the plus side no one here knows Tommy’s name

Two MEN Tommy’s age sit near him Both wear untucked striped
dress shirts and Diesel jeans Both have a bit too much gel
in their hair

They could be lawyers or car salesmen or executives Whatever
it is they both have jobs and they’re annoying Tommy

Eventually the men realize that Tommy is staring at them The
bolder of the two stares back for a few seconds

TOMMY
Say something

After a tense beat the two men stand and walk away Tommy
stares after them still surly disappointed that nothing h
happened He has a long night ahead of him and nothing to dé

He reaches for his cell phone

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The phone rings and Grace reaches around a sleeping Maggie to
get it She keeps her voice low so as not to wake the girls

GRACE
Hello

INTERCUT between bedroom and bar
TOMMY
Hey It’s Tommy Sorry I know it’s

like one in the morning

Grace glances at the clock

GRACE
It’s three

TOMMY
What

GRACE

It’s three in the morning

TOMMY
So I had a few beers and it turns
out this is like the world’s most
expensive beer or something ‘cause
now they’re saying I owe forty
bucks

Grace stares at the television screen This is not what she
needs right now

TOMMY
Hello

GRACE
Where are you

Grace listens for another moment and hangs up the phone She
kisses Isabelle’s hair The girl opens her eyes groggy and
disoriented

GRACE
Sweetheart I have to go somewhere
for a minute Take Maggie to the
bathroom if she wakes up okay

51

Isabelle nods and falls back asleep instantly
INT YUPPIE BAR -—- NIGHT

Grace enters It’s closing time and almost everyone has
cleared out She hears Tommy before she sees him

TOMMY (0C)
You’re just grumpy ‘cause you got
the world’s biggest nose

As Grace approaches Tommy is leaning across the bar trying
to grab the bartender’s nose It may not be the world’s
biggest but it’s up there

The bartender (let’s call him THE NOSE) is intensely
unamused

Tommy sees Grace

TOMMY
Hey Grace Say hello to the Nose
The Nose has closed the bar

GRACE
How much does he owe you

THE NOSE
Forty And two broken glasses

Grace is angry with Tommy and she’s exhausted At the same
time she cant take her eyes off the bartender’s nose

GRACE
(reaching into handbag)
Okay so you want to say fifty

She hands over the money trying very hard not to stare

THE NOSE
Get him out of here before I call
the police

TOMMY
Relax Women think big noses are
sexy Right

GRACE
Yes No I mean-- come on
52

Grace is trying to get Tommy moving toward the door She’s
trying not to insult the bartender She‘s trying not to
laugh She’s failing on all counts

TOMMY
I think it’s sexy

THE NOSE
That’s enough of that

TOMMY
Are you gonna sneeze on us now

THE NOSE
If you come here again I’m calling
the police

TOMMY

Let me touch it

Tommy reaches across the bar The bartender leans back to
avoid his grasping hand

Grace drags Tommy toward the door

INT JEEP - NIGHT
Grace drives while Tommy smokes She’s still laughing

GRACE
Youre such an idiot

TOMMY
I mean but that was a huge nose
wasn’t it You have to admit that
was I mean that was up there
with the great ones

Tommy stares into the Pennsylvania night

TOMMY
When we were kids Sam beat up
everyone I pissed off He wasn’t
even that big but he could take
anyone

GRACE
Yeah well maybe he should have
let them beat you up I’m sure you
deserved it

53

Tommy nods exhaling twin plumes of smoke from his nostrils
Grace glances at him and then back to the road They pull up
to a red stoplight

TOMMY

I never fucking missed anyone
before

(beat)
I really miss him I really do I
mean my stomach hurts whenever I
think about it

(beat)

God what a shitty world this is

GRACE
Don’t say that

TOMMY
Why not All the assholes walking
around and Sam’s dead

Grace stares out the windshield Several seconds pass

TOMMY
Green light

Grace begins to sob resting her head on the rim of the
steering wheel

Tommy watches her He has no idea what to do

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Tommy lies face down on the sofa in Sam and Grace’s living
room He still wears his clothes from the previous night and
he’s drooled a little on the cushion

The girls are shrieking with laughter in the kitchen and the
noise wakes him He lifts his head disoriented and hungover
shielding his eyes from the sunlight flooding the room

ISABELLE Oh no I dropped it I’11 make
another one

Tommy sits up wipes his mouth looks around He looks like a
man with a bad headache

MAGGIE (0-S)
Try again

ISABELLE You have to do it like this

INT KITCHEN — DAY

The girls are making pancakes Isabelle tosses them into the
air and catches them in a big pan Several misses lie smushed
on the floor Maggie stirs batter in a bowl Gobs of pancake
mix are splattered everywhere

Tommy wanders in rubbing the sleep out of his eyes

MAGGIE
Hi Why are you sleeping here

Isabelle drops another one She peels it off the floor and
replaces it in the pan

ISABELLE
It’s hard to catch them

Tommy opens the refrigerator and looks inside Isabelle
gidles up to him and whispers

ISABELLE
We’re making pancakes for Mom so
she won’t be so sad

MAGGIE
It’s because our Dad is dead

ISABELLE
He knows He’s his brother

Tommy pulls the milk out of the refrigerator and drinks

MAGGIE
No drinking from the carton

TOMMY
Shut up and make your pancakes

The girls are not remotely offended by their grumpy uncle
Isabelle offers him the pan

ISABELLE
Want one

TOMMY
I don’t like pancakes

ISABELLE
Our pancakes are the best

TOMMY
Eat your own crap

He takes another slurp from the carton as Grace enters She
looks tired too but a whole lot better than Tommy She
takes in the disaster area of her kitchen

MAGGIE
Hi Mommy

GRACE
Sweetie is that pan hot

ISABELLE
Uh huh We’re making pancakes

GRACE
Okay but you have to be careful
with that

Meanwhile Hank is sneaking up to the kitchen window Tommy
sees him coming before anyone else He says nothing

Hank presses his palms against the glass and makes a monster
face Maggie turns sees him and screams with delight

MAGGIE
Grandpa

The girls run to the kitchen door open it and let their
grandfather inside

As they hug him Hank notices that Tommy’s in the kitchen He
seems surprised and a little annoyed to find his son here

GRACE
Hey Pop

She kisses her father-in-law’s cheek

HANK
Hiya sweetie

GRACE
Come on girls let’s get the table
set

She leads the girls into the dining room with a stack of
plates and flatware

Hank and Tommy are alone now Each seems uncomfortable
other man’s presence

Tommy lights a cigarette maybe just to give himself
something to do

HANK
Hey

TOMMY
Hey

Another awkward silence

HANK
You having pancakes

TOMMY
No You hungry I think theres one
on the shelf there

HANK
No thanks Listen
(searching for words)
I was a little stupid the other
day
(already getting annoyed)
But I was okay to drive

TOMMY
We were both a little

Hank nods grateful he doesn’t have to explain anymore
grateful that he doesn’t need to make a formal apology

HANK
Okay It was good to talk about
things anyway
(looking around kitchen)
She make any coffee

TOMMY
Dad

Hank stops his search and looks at his son
TOMMY
I know Sam was always better at
things than me Football stuff
like that

Hank smiles proud at the memory of Sam’s achievements

in the

HANK
He was a great quarterback wasn’t
he That game against Easton he
threw for--

TOMMY
Four hundred and twenty yards I
know

HANK

Four hundred and twenty yards
Still the school record

(beat)
You could have been great too You
had the talent But you always gave
up Sam never gave up

Tommy taps off the ash on the edge of the kitchen sink

TOMMY
I just said it right I just
admitted that he was better at
everything But the thing is
he’s gone And it isn’t my fault I
wish it wasn’t true I wish--

HANK
Well that’s the way it is
(turning away from Tommy)
Isn‘t there any coffee

TOMMY
Jesus Dad--

HANK
(increasingly heated)

Dont start on me like your mother
you hear You can’t whine about
something that’s over I just want
some peace and quiet understand I
don’t want to listen to anymore
bullshit

Tommy smokes his cigarette not looking at his father

HANK
You really want to do something
helpful you can start by fixing up
this kitchen It looks awful

Hank studies his son’s face We get the sense that the older
Man regrets yelling at his son regrets his harsh words but
something about Tommy seems to infuriate him

He pats Tommy’s cheek not so gently and walks away

Tommy’s alone now leaning against the kitchen counter He
glances around at the unpainted walls and the exposed wiring
EXT BUNKER - DAY

Snow has come in the night dusting the mud huts and the
bunker Two GUERILLAS sit in the flatbed of one of the pickup
trucks playing a game of panjpar AK-47s by their sides
INT BUNKER - DAY

Joe Willis sits in the corner where he always sits
shivering He looks dehydrated exhausted and broken

Sam paces the cell looking for any weakness in the walls
any chance of escape

He has performed the same search a hundred times before with
no success but the search itself gives him something to do
a way to resist his helplessness

He glances down at the young soldier who has begun to cry
quietly in the corner There is compassion in Sam’s face but

disgust also Joe Willis’ weakness is a disease and Sam
doesn’t want to catch it

Sam sits back against the wall He hears Joe whimpering

SAM
Joe

Joe looks at him
SAM
Stop crying All you’re doing is
wasting bedy fluid

Joe closes his eyes tries to pull himself together It’s not
working

JOE
You think they’1ll come get us

53

SAM
Of course they will There’s a
thousand men looking for us

JOE
Why don’t they come then

SAM
They’re coming Try to stay with me
here When they come they’re coming
in hard everythings gonna happen
real fast and we better be ready

Joe listens to Sam’s words and looks at Sam’s face but he
doesn’t seem to believe anything he hears Sam decides to try
a different tack

SAM

Tell me about your wife
JOE

Cassie
SAM

You have more than one

JOE
(almost a smile)
She’s got her driver’s test coming
up She’s gonna fail She already
failed three times

SAM
Didn’t you teach her

JOE
Itry but she’s always
daydreaming running through stop
signs Girl’s a menace

SAM
What about Joe Junior

JOE
(beaming)
He looks like her Cassie’s got
these weird little thumbs like
lollypops And so does Joe

Sam smiles and looks away thinking about his own family
Joe’s smile begins to slip and he starts to cry again

60

JOE
I should be with them I should be
with them right now

SAM
Hey

He sits up and goes over to Joe crouching so his face is
close to the weeping young soldier’s

SAM
Look at me Joe Look at me We’1l
get out of here I promise you

Joe searches Sam’s eyes desperate to believe him

JOE
You don’t think we’re gonna die

SAM
Yes I do But not here

Joe laughs a little the tears still streaming down his face
Sam puts his arm around the kid holds him close

SAM
We’re gonna make it You hear me
We’re gonna make it

EXT CAHILL HOUSE - LATER

A contractor’s pickup truck pulls up to the curb Four men
step out of the extended cab Tommy AJ Owen and Sweeney

Tommy’s friends wear paint-splattered overalls AJ carries
a ladder Sweeney holds a power drill in one hand and a tool
box in the other Owens got the case of Milwaukee’s Best

INT GIRLS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Grace cleans the girls’ room picking up scattered toys and

books When she hears rough laughter outside she goes to the
window and watches the workmen with a perplexed expression

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

The men examine the room with critical eyes

61

SWEENEY
Your brother try to do this
himself

TOMMY

Guess so yeah

SWEENEY
Well he was a hell of a football
player But he didn’t know shit
about drywall

Grace enters the kitchen The men busy laying down tarps
don’t notice her in the doorway for a moment

TOMMY
Hey Uh Grace this is AJ Owen
and fuck Sweeney I don’t even

know your first name

SWEENEY
Yeah there’s a reason for that
(to Grace)
Nice to meet you

TOMMY
We’re gonna do a little you know
what do you call it

Awd
We’re gonna build you a proper
kitchen

GRACE

Wow Really

The men are already getting into their work This is
obviously what they do for a living and judging from their
brisk efficient manner they do it well

Grace watches them for a moment still a little mystified by
the whole thing

GRACE
Anybody want some coffee

SWEENEY
Nah thanks Maybe a beer

OWEN
Let‘s start with beers

EXT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

Grace sits in her Jeep in a long line of parked mothers The
rain has started and the waiting cars have their headlights
turned on windshield wipers beating

The CHILDREN coming out of the school looked after by
several TEACHERS rush to the waiting cars

Isabelle and Maggie come down the steps both wearing yellow
rain slickers Isabelle holds her younger sister’s hand She
carefully leads her down the slick steps

INT JEEP - CONTINUOUS

Grace watches her daughters approaching the Jeep She smiles
but there are tears in her eyes

INT CAHILL HOUSE - DUSK

Grace and her daughters return carrying plastic bags filled
with groceries When the girls hear the sounds of male
laughter they rush into the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The girls stare up at the big men intimidated

The kitchen is beginning to look like it belongs in a model
home The kitchen table is covered with empty cans of beer

Tommy stands on a ladder painting a wall AJ attaches
hinges for the cabinet doors with a power drill

ISABELLE
Can I help

Tommy looks down at her The power drill is loud

TOMMY
What

ISABELLE
Can I help

TOMMY
Why don’t you go watch TV

63

SWEENEY
Read a book you mean

TOMMY
Yeah read a book

ISABELLE
Please

AJ
You insured kid

TOMMY
Okay get up here

He steps down from the ladder and helps Isabelle climb it
keeping his hands beside her to make sure she doesn’t slip

Unfortunately he forgets to move the can of paint which
rests on the uppermost rung In her excitement Isabelle
knocks the can over spilling all the white paint onto Owen
who lies on his stomach on the kitchen floor grouting the
tiles

He scrambles to his feet his jeans and shirt drenched with
paint

OWEN
Shit What are you doing

Isabelle stares at him in horror Tommy scoops her off the
ladder before she can do any more damage The other men take
a time out to drink from their cans of beers

SWEENEY
How ya doin’ there whitey

OWEN
Fuck you I bought these jeans two
days ago

ISABELLE

I’m sorry

Grace walks into the kitchen She sees Owen and has to bite
her lip to keep from Laughing

OWEN
Where’s the bathroom

GRACE
Just wait here a minute

64

She hurries out Owen stares down at his ruined clothes

OWEN
Goddamn

TOMMY
It mostly missed you I think

OWEN
You kidding me I’m covered in it

TOMMY
Nah you can barely see it

INT MASTER BEDROOM MOMENTS LATER

Grace opens the closet door and looks through Sam’s hanging
shirts She runs her hand down one of the sleeves lost for a
moment

Finally she grabs all of the shirts and yanks them off the
bar hangers and all
INT KITCHEN - LATER

Isabelle has been banished Tommy Ad and Sweeney sit
around the table drinking beer

Owen stands in the middle of the kitchen stripped down to
his boxers and his tube socks He has a big belly a hairy
back and a Devil Girl tattoo on his shoulder

OWEN
What the hell you looking at

TOMMY
You have a lovely body Owen

OWEN
Bat me

SWEENEY
Do you work out

TOMMY
Your socks are pretty cool too

OWEN
You’re so fucking funny

Grace walks into the kitchen carrying a large bundle of
Sam’s clothes

GRACE
Here you go I think they’1l fit
you

Tommy sees Sam’s clothes His grin fades

OWEN
All I need is a t-shirt and some
pants

She hands him the bundle

GRACE
Take it all

OWEN
I don’t need all that

GRACE
There’s more

She walks out of the kitchen again

OWEN
You don’t have to do that
(to Tommy)
She doesn’t have to give me all

that

He lays the clothes down on the kitchen table and starts
sorting through them

Tommy stands beside Owen and looks through his brother’s
shirts and pants feeling the fabric

None of the men are laughing anymore

TOMMY
Why don’t you take it all

OWEN
Tommy it‘’s--

TOMMY
No please take it

OWEN
I don’t have to bring it back

66

SWEENEY
Jesus are you listening Take the
clothes

OWEN
Okay I’m just asking

TOMMY
Why don’t we call it a day

SWEENEY
You got it

He and AJ stand grabbing the remaining beers

AJ
Start up again tomorrow morning

TOMMY
Yeah Yeah Thanks fellas

His friends slap his shoulder as they walk out of the
kitchen leaving him alone at the table

INT BUNKER DAY

Joe Willis sleeps on his side curled up like a small child
Sam stands near the door We hear shouted commands in Pashtu
and footsteps approaching the bunker

SAM
Joe
(beat)
Joe

The private hasn’‘t had a real sleep in days he blinks now
staring up at Sam with groggy eyes No help whatsoever

The door swings open and four armed GUERILLAS storm into the
room Two grab Sam and push him toward the door The other
two haul Joe off the ground and shove him out behind Sam

EXT GUERILLA CAMP - CONTINUOUS

Prodded with the muzzles of AK-47s Sam and Joe walk toward a
pickup truck parked on the edge of the camp

Sam looks around trying to gauge the faces of his captors
trying to suss out the situation

Joe is certain that they are walking towards their execution
At one point he falls to the ground trembling shaking his
head furiously

JOE
Don’t please

One of the guerillas seizes him by the scruff of the neck and
forces him back to his feet Another gives him a kick in the
backside They’re all laughing at Joe now calling him names
in Pashtu

There is a distinction in the way the captors treat their
captives Sam is a hated enemy but there is a modicum of
respect for his stoic behavior- he might be a soldier in the
Devils Army but at least he is a man

Joe Willis on the other hand elicits nothing but disgust
from the Pashtuns He cries like a child he soils himself in
his terror His cowardice is considered a disgrace by the
Taliban fighters

Koushan the commander waits for the Americans beside the
pickup truck Six other fighters some carrying Kalashnikovs
others bearing stolen American M-4s surround the captives

Koushan studies the American soldiers for a moment He barks
an order in Pashtu One of the younger guerillas MURAD
translates into English

MURAD
Show us how to arm this

In the back of the pickup truck Sam sees an American SMAW
(Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon) in a desert
camo carrying case Joe sees it too Neither man moves

Koushan glares at his hostages He pulls out a revolver and
walks over to Joe repeating his command

MURAD
Show us how to arm this

Koushan jam his gun into Joe‘s head

JOE
I don’t know how

Koushan yells in Pashtu and Joe stammers his defense trying
to plead his case

68

JOE
I swear to God I don’t know how I
never fired one of them

MURAD
Don’t lie to us

The other guerillas are screaming at Joe now taunting him
laughing at his terror

JOE
Please

Koushan is tired of the excuses He levels the pistol

SAM
I know how to do it

The Pashtuns turn and examine Sam

SAM
Let him go and I‘11 show you

Koushan stares into Sam’s eyes Koushan has been fighting in
the hills ever since the Russians were the invaders he is no
man’s fool and he suspects everyone and everything

SAM
Let him go and I’11 show you

Koushan smiles his teeth stained green from chewing naswar
He holds the gun firmly against Joe‘s temple and waits

Sam has no bargaining leverage He hesitates for a beat
Finally he walks to the truck opens the case and removes
the SMAW

It‘s a fearsome looking weapon capable of flattening a house
with a single shell

With a series of quick practiced motions Sam arms it

Koushan still holding the gun to Joe’s head says something
to Murad

MURAD
Show us again Slowly this time

SAM
Let him go
(wary beat)
And give him water He needs water

69

Koushan seems almost amused by Sams demands We hear the
words “Coca-Cola” in his Pashtu response

MURAD
And maybe you’d like a nice cold
Coca-Cola Some air conditioning
perhaps for your room

Sam and Koushan watch each other neither man blinking

SAM
Get him some water

Koushan considers for another beat before holstering his
pistol and issuing a command One of his fighters unscrews a
canteen and hands it to Joe

Joe stares at the canteen too scared to take any action
without permission Sam nods at him Joe drinks deeply

He attempts to hand the canteen to Sam but Koushan raises his
arm blocking the handoff Koushan gestures at the SMAW

Sam surveys the group of fighters arrayed around him The
young men watch him fingers on the triggers of their rifles

Sam demonstrates slowly this time how to arm the device

SAM
Take the battery

He slides the battery into place

SAM
Take off the protection cap open
the sight release the safety

Sam stands in the middle of the Taliban camp holding an
armed high-powered rocket launcher A SMAW only holds one
shell but it’s powerful enough to destroy a tank

We sense that Sam is rapidly considering his options He
could easily kill a number of enemies right now But he and
Joe would die themselves within seconds

Koushan half-smiling holds out his hands for the weapon

Sam finally hands it over A dark look crosses his face he
feels he has betrayed himself his country

Koushan holds the SMAW above his head brandishing the war
trophy shouting in Pashtu His men holler with pride

INT BUNKER - LATER

Sam sits with his back to the wall holding a canteen
staring at nothing Joe Willis sits near him

JOE
I thought they were gonna kill us

Sam doesn’t look at him

JOE
You saved me

Sam still doesn’t look at Joe He speaks in a monotone no
evident emotion

SAM
They can take out a tank now An
APC Another helicopter

JOE
You had to do it They would have
killed us

Sam slowly turns his head to look at Joe Whatever Joe sees
in Sam’s eyes frightens him

EXT MAHLUS MAIN STREET - DAY

Tommy stands on a street corner smoking a cigarette down to
the butt He’s staring at a bank across the street He looks
nervous He throws down the cigarette crushes it with the
toe of his work boot and crosses the street

INT BANK - DAY

Tommy walks inside the bank He looks around expecting to be
accosted but no one seems to notice him The SECURITY GUARD
a retired cop in his fifties doesn’t even look his way The
BANK PATRONS and EMPLOYEES all go about their business as if
Tommy were invisible

A young woman DANIELLE MANCUSO sits at a desk reviewing
some papers She wears a gold cross on her neck

Tommy sees her from across the room He takes a deep breath
and approaches her desk

Danielle looks up with a smile

DANIELLE
Hi welcome to First National

Her smile dissolves when she recognizes Tommy’s face She
freezes too terrified to speak or move

TOMMY
(trying to calm her)
No no I’m just I’m just here to--

DANIELLE
Please

Tommy raises his hands

TOMMY
I just came down to talk to you--

Danielle looks at the security guard desperation in her
eyes She’s in luck the guard glances over and sees that the
woman’s on the verge of panicking

He rushes to her desk hand on the butt of his holstered
automatic

SECURITY GUARD
Sir step away from the desk

TOMMY
Hold on a second I’m just trying
to--
SECURITY GUARD
(stepping between Tommy
and Danielle)
Sir--

A second SECURITY GUARD sees the commotion and hurries over
walkie-talkie in hand The bank patrons are watching some a
little fearful all curious

SECURITY GUARD
We’re gonna have to ask you to step
outside with us--

As the guards try to usher Tommy away from the desk the
anger builds behind his eyes the will to violence

TOMMY
Get your hands off me

72

SECURITY GUARD
Sir--

The guards are holding him now trying to drag him away
Tommy wants to lash out but he controls himself gives it
one more shot

TOMMY
(to Danielle)
I just wanted to say I’m sorry
That’s all I came down here to say
I‘m sorry

The security guards continue ushering Tommy toward the door
He shoves off their arms and walks on his own volition He’s
halfway there when Danielle stands

DANIELLE
Hold on
(nodding to guards)
It’s okay Let him stay

SECURITY GUARD 2
Ms Mancuso--

DANIELLE
It’s okay

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

The new kitchen is a thing of beauty the subway tiles
perfectly laid the paint glossy and fresh the cabinets
straight and clean The lights are off and three candles burn
on the butcher block counter top

Grace and Tommy sit on the floor bottles of beer beside
them Tommy rolls a neat joint

A small boombox on the floor plays Springsteen’s “The River”
softly so it won’t wake the girls upstairs

TOMMY
We ended up talking almost an hour
(beat)
She hadn’t slept right in three
years Kept having these nightmares
Id come back and shoot her
(beat)
When I told her she didn’t have to
be afraid anymore that Id never
hurt her again
(MORE)

TOMMY (contd)
she started to cry Just started
crying right there in the bank

Grace watches Tommy not saying a word

TOMMY
And then she thanked me Can you
believe that She said she felt
like she could breathe again
(beat)
She asked me if I wanted to open an
account

GRACE
(Laughing)
You’re kidding me

TOMMY
Swear to God

GRACE
So what did you do

TOMMY
So I opened an account I have like
one hundred and twelve dollars but
now I have a checkbook

GRACE
I’m proud of you

TOMMY
I know I finally feel like a real
American I can’t wait to start
bouncing checks

GRACE
You know what I mean

TOMMY
Yeah Sam wanted me to do it

GRACE
Of course he did

For a moment they’re quiet thinking about Sam listening to
the music Tommy sparks the joint

TOMMY
T used to sit in my room late at
night back when I was seventeen
eighteen just play this song over
and over again in the dark

74

GRACE
so did I

Tommy seems genuinely surprised by this news

TOMMY
Really

GRACE
Why is that so shocking

TOMMY
No I just figured you were
listening to the Go-Gos or
something

GRACE
Fuck you
(watching Tommy inhale)
I like the Go-Gos
(beat)
Give me that

TOMMY
Really

GRACE
Yeah really give it

Tommy hands her the joint Grace takes a deep hit not some
squirrely little mouth puff She exhales three perfect rings

Tommys impressed

GRACE

You think I’m such a square
TOMMY

No
GRACE

Yeah you do

TOMMY
Well I’m starting to reassess
Snoop Dogg You want to hand that
back

GRACE
Just because I was a cheerleader

75

She returns the joint Their fingers brush against each other
on the handoff

TOMMY
And you dated the quarterback

GRACE
God I’m such a cliché

TOMMY
You were a little stuck up you got
to admit

GRACE
No see guys always think girls are
stuck up if they don’t talk to
them But it wasn’t ‘cause I was
stuck up I just didn’t like you
You were always getting drunk
getting into fights

TOMMY
Like Sam didn’t get into fights

GRACE
Not after I told him to stop

TOMMY
Well maybe you should’ve told me
to stop too

A look passes between them Tommy is the first to look away
raising his bottle of beer and drinking deeply

For a moment they both listen to the song’s sad harmonica
Grace’s eyes go distant

GRACE
I felt it today for the first time

Tommy watches her but says nothing

GRACE
I know he’s gone I know he’s never
coming back

They sit alone in the candlelit kitchen as Springsteen sings

But I remember us riding in my brothers car

Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir

At night on them banks I’d lie awake

And pull her close just to feel each breath shed take

INT BUNKER - NIGHT

The song continues to play Sam sits with his back against
the cinderblock wall staring into nothingness

Joe Willis sleeps curled up like a child

Down to the river my baby and I

Oh down to the river we ride

INT DINING ROOM DAY

Isabelle and Maggie carry a birthday cake into the dining
room Blue icing sloppily but lovingly applied spells
“MOM”

Grace Tommy Hank and Elsie sit at the table Grace smiles
as her daughters sing “Happy Birthday” and present the cake

GRACE

Thank you Such a beautiful cake
MAGGIE

ISABELLE

Grandma made it

ELSIE
We all made it together

MAGGIE

ISABELLE

MAGGIE

Grace makes a wish and blows out the candles There are too
many and soon Maggie and Isabelle are helping

Elsie starts cutting the cake while Maggie pulls out a candle
and licks the stem

GRACE
(to Tommy)
Did you tell them about your job

77

ELSIE

Sweeney took me on they’re

HANK

TOMMY
Yeah

HANK
(digging into his cake)
Good player

Isabelle whispers in Tommy’s ear

ELSIE
It’s rude to whisper sweetheart

TOMMY
(to Isabelle)
Don’t you want some cake first

Isabelle shakes her head Tommy puts down his fork and
stands

ISABELLE
Come on Mom

Maggie is standing too very excited

MAGGIE
We broke something Come look

GRACE
(standing playing along)
Uh oh you broke something

MAGGIE
I was playing with it and then I
stepped on it

GRACE
Well we‘d better go see

The girls lead Grace and Tommy toward the kitchen door

78

HANK

I guess I get to eat all the cake
MAGGIE

Nooo
ELSIE

Grandma will make sure he doesn’t
touch it until you get back

A moment later the young people are gone Hank and Elsie
cheerful and outgoing when the others are around grow somber
the moment they’re alone not looking at each other

EXT CAHILL HOUSE - DAY

The girls run with Grace each daughter holding one of her

hands They lead her to the back of the garage where Tommy
stands beside a brand-new bicycle

MAGGIE

TSABELLE
Happy birthday

Happy birthday

GRACE
A bicycle

TOMMY
Tt was their idea

ISABELLE
Do you like it

GRACE
It’s beautiful

Maggie squeezes the horn

MAGGIE
Can we have cake now

GRACE
Of course you can

Isabelle and Maggie run back inside
Grace runs her hand over the painted metal
GRACE

I haven’t had a bike since tenth
grade It looks expensive

79

Tommy shrugs happy to see that Grace likes it

TOMMY
Sweeney gave me an advance
(proud despite himself)
I wrote a check for it

GRACE
Thank you

TOMMY
Youre welcome

Grace smiles and hugs him Both of them seem very happy

The hug lasts longer than expected When they release each
other neither is smiling anymore They are standing very
close Grace’s hair has fallen over her eyes but she makes no
move to push it away

They kiss It’s a good kiss a long kiss and when it’s over
neither of them knows what to do

Grace smiles again maybe to cover her panic She turns and
jogs back to the house

Tommy stands alone behind the garage with the brand-new
bicycle

INT PHELAN’S BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

It’s a Saturday night and the place is packed with young
people drinking and shouting over the music from the jukebox

Tommy sits at the bar downing a shot of Jameson’s Someone
in the crowd bumps into his back hard Tommy shoves back
not even turning to see who bumped him He gets another push
in return

The YOUNG GUYS standing behind Tommy are watching him now
waiting to see what he’1l do

Tommy stares straight ahead He is about to turn around and
start throwing punches

But then he doesn’t He stands and walks out of the bar
never turning to look at the guys behind him

EXT CAHILL HOUSE - DAWN

Tommy stands at the front door holding a stack of long
lacquered shelves

Grace opens the door wearing sweatpants and a tshirt

GRACE
Hey

TOMMY
Hey I brought the shelves

GRACE
Oh What shelves

TOMMY
We only installed half the shelves
last time So this is the rest

GRACE
Great Come in

Tommy tries to walk in the door but the shelves are longer
than the width of the doorway and they bump into the lintel

He frowns trying to decipher this problem Finally he turns
sideways and steps inside
INT CAHILL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Grace watches him with a small smile as they walk to the
kitchen

GRACE
Are you hungover

TOMMY
No no I’m drunk
INT KITCHEN CONTINUOUS
Tommy places the shelves on the floor

TOMMY
Where are the girls

GRACE
They’re sleeping It’s six in the
morning
TOMMY

You know what I’m sorry I
shouldn’t have kissed you

GRACE
No it was me--

TOMMY
It was stupid--

GRACE
Don’t worry

TOMMY
All right yeah
(looking at shelves)
I’ll just put these up for you

GRACE
Don’t feel bad about it

TOMMY
I don’t I mean I do but mainly
just ‘cause I want to do it again

Tommy shakes his head angry with himself for having said
that He picks up one of the shelves

GRACE
It’s just because we miss Sam so
much

Tommy looks at her He says nothing

GRACE
The others miss him too Of course
they miss him But-—-

Tommys not entirely convinced that’s the whole explanation
but he nods

TOMMY
Yeah No you’re right
(beat)
I don’t want to ruin anything I
just want to keep coming here

GRACE
You can come here all you want
Ill give you a key

Tommy considers this
TOMMY

Id rather have one for the

Mustang
Grace laughs Tommy begins installing the shelves as Grace
watches him
INT BUNKER - DAY
Sam and Joe are sleeping when the Taliban fighters enter the

bunker Screaming insults they roust the exhausted captives
and haul them out the door

EXT GUERILLA CAMP - DAY

Sam and Joe are forced to their knees in the dirt Fierce-
looking young men with AK-47s surround them taunting them in
Pashtu slapping the backs of their heads

One of the young men holds a small video camera The red LED
light is on as the camera records Sam and Joe

Joe is even more terrified when he sees the camera He knows
what kind of videos these men shoot

Sam’s reaction on seeing the camera is to exhale and lower
his eyes This is the moment

Koushan and Murad the commander’s translator stand over the
kneeling prisoners When Koushan speaks the younger men hush

Koushan nods and one of the men drops a three-foot length of
steel pipe on the dirt in front of Sam

Sam and Joe both stare at the pipe

Koushan points at Sam while Murad translates and the camera
man records the scene

MURAD
This one has knowledge We can
still use him
(Koushan points at Joe)
(MORE)

MURAD (contd)
This one is nothing A waste of
food a waste of water

Murad nods at Sam

MURAD
Kill him

Sam has no visible reaction to this command Joe stares at
Murad in horror his lower lip beginning to quiver He turns
to look at Sam but Sam’s face is unreadable

The camera man zooms in on Joe’s panic A broken American
soldier makes for good propaganda

Joe is desperate to make eye contact with Sam

JOE
Sam-—

He reaches over to touch Sam’s arm but the fighters behind
him shove him to the ground

JOE
Sam

Koushan gives a command and two of the Taliban men grab Sam
and roughly stand him up They force the pipe into his hands

MURAD
Do you want to live

Joe is still on the ground hollering as the Taliban men
kick him in the ribs and hold him down with their boot heels

MURAD
Do you want to live

Sam stares at the ground Koushan gestures impatient

One of the fighters punches Sam in the kidneys He falls to
his knees gasping They haul him to his feet again pick up
the fallen pipe and shove it back into his grasp

MURAD
Do it now

Sam is not the man he was a few weeks ago He has lost a good
deal of weight He is severely dehydrated His confidence and
authority have been stolen from him

Still he meets Koushan’s fierce look and this time he does
not lower his eyes

Sam drops the pipe

Koushan draws his revolver He presses it against Sam’s
forehead and cocks the hammer

Sam does not close his eyes He stares back at Koushan
breathing deeply preparing himself for the bullet

But Koushan does not pull the trigger Instead he watches Sam
carefully gauging the man before speaking

MURAD
(to Sam translating)
You have family yes Do you want
to see them again Eh Do you want
to live

Sam can do nothing but breathe in the air and stare back at
Koushan the pistol barrel pressed to his forehead

Koushan mutters a quiet order Murad pulls out a photograph
It’s Grace the picture Sam took with him from Pennsylvania

Murad holds the photograph in front of Sam’s eyes forcing
Sam to look

MURAD
This is your wife She is beautiful
woman Does she wait for you back
in America

Sam clenches his eyes shut trying to will the image of Grace
from his mind Murad sees the crack in the wall He presses
his advantage

MURAD
Do you have children Do they wait
for you at home

Sam tries not to listen His eyes are shut His breaths are
coming faster and faster his ribcage rising and falling the
veins in his neck bulging

MURAD
Don’t you want to see them grow

Sam’s fists clench and unclench

MURAD
Don’t you want to go home

Sam opens his eyes A yell rises in his throat half snarl
half scream wordless fury Koushan shouts back at him

One of the fighters scoops the pipe off the ground and forces
it into Sam’s hands

MURAD
Do it

The Taliban men scream at Sam a clamor of voices their
words unknown their meaning clear

The camera man records everything

Sam breathing heavily his eyes terrible to behold clutches
the steel pipe and stares down at Joe Willis kneeling on the
ground before him

MURAD
Now

Joe looks up at Sam his mouth half-open Whatever he sees in
Sam’s face terrifies him

But Joe cannot believe that Sam will hurt him Sam was sent
to rescue him Sam is the protector Joe tries to smile to
win back the captain’s affection

JOE
Sam-—

Sam swings and the pipe cracks Joe in the upper arm Joe
screams and tumbles to the ground his arm broken

The Taliban men grab Joe and force him back to his knees as
he continues to scream in agony

MURAD
Again Do it now

Sam swings again groaning and again battering Joe Willis
into the dust as the Pashtuns cheer around him

The awful sound of steel hitting flesh breaking bone

INT BUNKER NIGHT

Sam sits with his back against the wall His hands are
flecked with blood His eyes are open and he’s breathing but
he gives no other sign of being alive
86

For a long count there is nothing but silence and darkness

The loud retorts of sniper fire break the quiet of the night
Panicked shouts in Pashtu soon fill the air as gunfire
crackles Grenades explode causing the bunker to shudder

Sam never blinks never moves A fierce battle rages beyond
his four walls but he seems unaware

Four American Special Forces soldiers break down the door to
the bunker and storm inside Flashlights are mounted to the
barrels of their M-4s They shine their lights on Sam
approaching cautiously searching the corners of the dark
room for booby traps

SOLDIER 1
Sir are you able to walk

Two of the soldiers bend down and help Sam to his feet He
shows no pleasure in his rescue no emotion at all The
soldiers lead him out of the bunker

INT MOBILE ARMY HOSPITAL - DAY

Sam sleeps on a hospital bed An IV with a fluid drip has
been inserted into a vein in his arm

LT SCHNEIDER (0C)

Can you hear me
(beat)

Can you hear me

Sam blinks opens his eyes and surges forward in bed nearly
tearing the IV from his arm

LT SCHNEIDER
Easy easy You’re safe

LIEUTENANT SCHNEIDER an Army doctor with a clipboard puts
his hand on Sam’s shoulder trying to soothe him

LT SCHNEIDER
Youre safe

Sam stares at the doctor getting his bearings before
settling back in bed He doesn’t Look like he feels safe

Another officer COLONEL ARROYO stands behind Schneider

87

LT SCHNEIDER
Lieutenant Dan Schneider with the
10th Mountain How do you feel

Sam looks around the tented hospital WOUNDED SOLDIERS lie
other hospital beds Most of them look to be in far worse
shape than Sam

LT SCHNEIDER
Can you tell me your name

Sam looks at the doctor confused It’s as if Schneider is
speaking a foreign language

LT SCHNEIDER
Can you tell me your name

SAM
Captain Sam Cahill 0419066

Lieutenant Schneider nods checking a box on his clipboard

SAM
T want to speak to my wife

Colonel Arroyo steps closer to the bed

COLONEL ARROYO
Absolutely We just need to ask you
a few questions and I’1l get you a
sat phone How did they treat you
in there

Sam hesitates

SAM
I’m alive

The colonel nods He can tell Sam doesn’t want to go into
detail and he decides not to press the issue right now

COLONEL ARROYO
You’re gonna be headline news
tomorrow Did you have any contact
with other prisoners

Another long pause as Sam stares up at the colonel

SAM
What do you mean

88

COLONEL ARROYO
We think there were other prisoners
in the camp but we didn’t find any
You must have seen them

Sam slowly shakes his head

COLONEL ARROYO
I’m sorry we have to do this right
now but I have some photos of men
missing in action

He hands Sam a binder filled with Army induction photos Sam
starts flipping through the pages

COLONEL ARROYO
We just need to know if youve seen
any of these men

Sam looks at the photographs

INSERT PHOTO BINDER

The young men all look cheerful and optimistic Most of them
are about nineteen Sam flips through the pages

He pauses at a photograph of Joe Willis
END INSERT

Sam’s expression does not change He continues flipping
through the pages reaching the end of the binder

He hands it back to the colonel

SAM
No I’m sorry

COLONEL ARROYO
Youre certain youve never seen
any of these men

Sam lies back in the bed staring at the ceiling

SAM
I’m sorry

COLONEL ARROYO
All right Well thank you
Captain Get some rest You’ve
earned it

The officers head for the exit

SAM
Did you find the video

Colonel Arroyo stops and turns

COLONEL ARROYO
What video

Sam hesitates The colonel watches him forehead creased

SAM
I thought maybe the cockpit
video from the Blackhawk maybe it
showed us something who shot us
down

COLONEL ARROYO
All the recording gear was
destroyed on impact But we’re
pretty sure the gang holding you
were the ones who shot you down So
we got some payback
The colonel smiles nods and departs with the lieutenant

Sam lies amongst his damaged comrades the only one awake

INT AIRBASE - CONTINUOUS

Isabelle and Maggie run to the sliding glass doors marked NO
UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL BEYOND THIS POINT

The doors slide open as Sam approaches The girls jump on

lasts a proper amount of time when they part Sam hugs his
mother who is also crying

93

SAM
Hey hey don’t cry

ELSIE
(crying)
I’m not crying

Sam kisses his mother’s cheek and hugs his father

SAM
Hey Dad

Finally he looks at Tommy who stands to the side a little
sheepish back to his traditional place on the fringe of the
family

Sam now stern-faced examines his younger brother Tommy
smiles nervous unsure how to act

Sam shakes his head gathering Tommy into a bearhug
SAM
(to Grace)

seem entirely thrilled by the transformation

SAM
Who did this

Tommy did this

GRACE
Him and some of his friends

Sam opens one of the cabinet doors The carpentry is
flawless

SAM
They did a good job

GRACE
Are you hungry Your mom brought
over about twenty pounds of food

Sam smiles polite but distant and shakes his head

SAM
No thanks

He walks out of the kitchen and up the stairs

ISABELLE
Where you going

The Cahill women stare after him confused

ISABELLE
What’s he doing

Grace shrugs and smiles for the girls

INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Sam sits down on the edge of the bed He runs his hand over
the cool soft cotton sheets and glances around this space he
used to know so well

MAGGIE (0C)
What are you doing Daddy

Sam sees his daughters and wife standing in the doorway He
smiles trying to seem normal safe the same old Dad

SAM
I don’t know Maybe we can let’s
just lie here for a while

He lies down in the bed still wearing his dress uniform his
polished boots

The girls look at him and then up at their mother

GRACE
Come on

She leads the girls to the bed and they all climb on lying
beside Sam

At first it seems kind of fun a weird slumber party After
ten seconds though it’s boring for the girls

ISABELLE
How long do we have to lie here

SAM
Just a little while

Grace cuddled up beside Maggie watches her husband She
won’t let on in front of the girls but she knows something
is wrong

Isabelle sits up a little She sees that her father has
already drifted off to sleep

96

ISABELLE
(whisper)
Can I go watch TV

GRACE
Just stay a little longer

ISABELLE
Okay

They all lie quietly on the bed watching Sam

MAGGIE
Is Dad dead again already

GRACE
He’s just sleeping

TSABELLE
You can’t die more than once

ISABELLE
No you can’t

Maggie aticks her tongue out at her big sister

The Cahill family lies in bed in the afternoon as the rain
taps against the windows

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sam lies beside Grace in bed his eyes wide open He turns to
look at her

Maybe he wants to wake her up to tell her something But
she’s sleeping so soundly her face smushed against the
pillow and Sam doesn’t want to disturb her

He stares up at the ceiling The surroundings have changed

but Sam’s expression is the same one he wore in the Taliban
bunker

EXT FORT MAHLUS - DAY

Sam in civilian clothes parks his Mustang in the lot

INT ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY

Sam walks down a long corridor with institutional linoleum on
the floor

He stops beside an open office door Inside Major Cavazos
speaks with an AIDE

CAVAZOS
Sam Figured you’d be in the
Bahamas by now

SAM
Can I talk to you somewhere

CAVAZOS
Everything okay

Sam nods Cavazos glances at the aide and then back to Sam

CAVAZOS
Let’s take a walk

EXT FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

Sam and Cavazos walk past the base’s football field On the
gridiron a group of young RECRUITS runs sprints under the
watchful eye of a SERGEANT

CAVAZOS
What I’m trying to figure out what
do they do with your grave Dig out
the coffin pull down the stone Or
just leave it there waiting till
you croak for real

Cavazos grinning sees that Sam is lost in his thoughts not
listening to the story of his own funeral

SAM
I wasn’t alone at the camp I saw
Joe Willis

It takes Cavazos a moment to register this information His
grin slowly fades He stops walking and Sam stops beside him

Cavazos’ tone changes abruptly the gregarious officer
speaking quietly now

CAVAZOS
I thought you had no contact with
other prisoners

Sam hesitates watching the recruits with their shaved heads
sprint down the field

Cavazos studies Sam waiting for some kind of response

SAM
We were in the same camp I

A long silence as Sam searches for the words But there are
no words

CAVAZOS
Sometimes it’s hard to remember

SAM
They had a video camera They made
a tape

CAVAZOS
What kind of tape

SAM
Didn‘t they find it When they took
the camp

CAVAZOS

I didn’t hear anything about a
tape I can check the debriefing
reports

Sam shakes his head

SAM
I don’t even know if I don’t
know

CAVAZOS

Look Sam you were in a helicopter
crash You had a serious head wound
that wasn’t treated You didn’t get
any food You were dehydrated and
you were waiting for these guys to
chop your head off Things were
probably a little confusing right
How could they not be confusing

Cavazos turns back to the football field

99

CAVAZOS
Take it easy Give yourself some
time You’ve got four weeks of RandR
brother-- go somewhere warm lie in
the sun

Sam looks at the major a little confused

CAVAZOS
You’re gonna be wearing a chestful
of medals pretty soon People all
over the country read about you
coming home and felt proud-- we
rescued one of our own man we
thought was dead It’s a great
story isn’t it

Cavazos claps Sam on the shoulder
CAVAZOS

You ever want to come talk to me
again the door’s always open

Sam stares up at the goalposts looming above him

EXT ICE SKATING RINK - DAY
Grace and the girls skate with Tommy at the outdoor rink
Sam sits on a bench just outside the rink watching them

Isabelle is the best skater by far She practices her camel
spins while Tommy lurches across the ice flailing his arms
and trying to stay upright

Grace holds Maggie’s hand the two of them skating long slow
loops Grace waves to Sam He waves back giving her a smile
She beckons for him to join them but he stays seated
watching

Grace has never looked more beautiful

Tommy swoops in out of control grabbing Maggie under the
armpits and lifting her into the air She shrieks delighted

Isabelle comes to her sisters aid and pretty soon all of
them have tumbled upon each other on the ice Everyone is
laughing They look like a happy family

Sam watches

Tommy pushes himself back to his feet and skates to the edge
of the ice nearly falling again toppling onto the bench
beside Sam

TOMMY
I’m better than I thought

He pants out of breath slouched on the bench For a moment
they watch the girls skating in the sunshine

SAM
Thank you for taking care of them
(beat)
T didn’t expect that

TOMMY
Of course man

SAM
I mean it I’m proud of you

Tommy nods watching the girls

TOMMY
It suddenly makes sense right

Sam watches Tommy watching the girls He leans forward

SAM
Let me ask you something Maybe it
sounds a little weird
(beat)
Did you fuck her

Tommy ambushed tries to laugh at the question but Sam’s
staring right at him waiting for an answer

TOMMY
What

SAM
Grace

He glances at his wife carving figure eights hand in hand
with Maggie lovely and serene and unaware of the
conversation unfolding thirty feet away

SAM
I can forgive you I just want to
know
(beat)
You thought I was dead

TOMMY
But we didn’t I mean of course
not What the hell you asking me

SAM
I can forgive you

TOMMY
We didn’t do anything Why you
asking me that

SAM
You look like a couple teenagers in
love

TOMMY

Come on You used to be pissed off
‘cause I couldn’t stand her Now I
figured out how cool she is what

youve always been telling me and
you‘re angry about that too

SAM
De I look angry

TOMMY
I don’t know what you just don’t
say things like that

Sam shrugs watching his wife

TOMMY
She’s way too old for me anyway

Sam smiles but his eyes are still dull and joyless

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Sam Grace and the girls eat dinner

ISABELLE
Leonard is stupid but Brian is
nice He never hits people

GRACE
(dishing out stringbeans)
Well that is nice

ISABELLE
T mean he hits the boys but not
the girls

(MORE)

ISABELLE (contd)
He’s the best at math and he’s got
a dog with big ears I can’t
remember it’s name

MAGGIE
Elephant

The comment is so silly and out of nowhere Grace can’t help
laughing Isabelle starts laughing too

Sam stares at them looking from face to face completely
mystified by their laughter He sits in brooding silence
amongst these people who have become strangers to him

SAM
An elephant is not a dog

The Cahill women stop Laughing and stare at him The sentence
is innocuous but anger lurks behind the words

MAGGIE
I know it’s not a dog

SAM
Then why’d you say it

MAGGIE
(starting to get scared)
I was joking

GRACE
(touching his arm)
Sam-—

SAM
Why is it funny

GRACE
Sweetheart relax--

She’s trying to stroke his arm to soothe him Sam pulls his
arm away from her and slams his fist down on his plate
shattering it He stands and storms away from the table
heading for the staircase and the bedroom

The girls sit in terrified silence Grace is frightened too
but she hides it well looking at each of her daughters

GRACE
It’s all right Don’t be afraid

INT MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Grace gets ready for bed removing her gold necklace Sam
stands in the doorway to the bathroom watching her

SAM
They like Tommy a lot don’t they

GRACE
Yes

She sits on the bed and pulls off her pants

SAM
He said he slept here

GRACE
He slept over a few times

SAM
Did he sleep in here

Grace looks up at her husband

GRACE
Of course not

SAM
You could have fallen in love

GRACE
No we couldn’t have

SAM
You thought I was dead
(moving closer to her)
The two of you look good together
Grace tries to play it as a joke She punches his leg

GRACE
Stop it

Sam watches her remove her earrings
He grabs her arm and holds it very tight hurting her

SAM
Did you fuck him

104

GRACE
Sam stop it

She’s afraid now but she smiles at him her eyes filled with
love with sympathy as she tries to calm him

GRACE
Sam

SAM
You fucked him

GRACE
Nothing happened
(beat)
We kissed We were confused

SAM
What else

GRACE
That’s it

He grabs her throat Sam is very fast very strong as his
fingers tighten true terror surfaces in Grace’s eyes

GRACE
Let go

He forces her onto her back on the bed
GRACE

(gasping for breath)
Let me go let me go

He could end her so easily Another twenty seconds would do
it

He releases her staring down with no pity as she gasps on
the bed Grace kicks at him sobbing

GRACE
What the hell is wrong with you

Sam ignores her He walks out of the room

INT GIRLS’ BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Maggie sleeps but Isabelle is awake She hears her father
going down the stairs hears the front door slam behind him

She gets out of bed and goes to the window watches her
father get into his Mustang and peel out of the driveway
EXT RIVERSIDE - NIGHT

Sam walks on the frozen mud on the bank of the Mahlus River
Every now and then headlights flash by as a car crosses a
bridge in the distance but it’s 2 AM on a cold winter’s
night and few people are out

He seems to be looking for something and finally he finds it
the battered steel lid of a trash can hanging from the branch
of an old thick-trunked pin oak

Sam gathers a handful of stones from the riverside and walks
twenty paces from the hanging lid

He turns gauges the distance by moonlight and begins
hurling rocks at the target

Thwang The first one connects Thwang The second as well

High school was twenty years ago a different lifetime but
Sam can still throw the rocks whistling through the air

Thwang Thwang Thwang

EXT CAHILL HOUSE - MORNING

The girls sit crosslegged in the backyard facing each other
Isabelle carefully paints Maggie’s face making her kid
sister look like an Apache warrior

Sam walks up the back path behind the garage He watches his
daughters unnoticed for a time He is exhausted his pants
and jacket dirty from sitting by the river all night

Isabelle sees him first She stares at him not saying a
word the paints now forgotten by her feet

Maggie turns to look at whatever has distracted Isabelle

Both girls stand staring at their father Maggie steps
behind Isabelle frightened

The girls’ fear wounds Sam

SAM
Don’t be afraid of me

He walks over to the girls attempting a tired smile
desperate not to scare them

SAM
(to Maggie)
Look at you you’re a brave you
can’t be afraid of me
(beat)
You know what a brave is

Maggie has no idea

ISABELLE
A Native American warrior

SAM
Yeah a Native American warrior

Sam crouches down so he’s closer to the girls’ eye level

SAM
Don’t be afraid of me Okay

The girls say nothing They don’t look as nervous as they did
a minute ago but they’re not carefree either

SAM
I’m sorry I shouted and did all
those silly things But I love you
Both of you Very much

Sam sees the tears in Isabelle’s eyes He gathers her in his
arms stroking her hair

SAM
Don’t be sad Don’t cry Don’t cry
sweetheart

He lets go of his daughter smiles at her smiles at Maggie
SAM

You know this one Why did the girl
blush when she opened the

refrigerator
ISABELLE MAGGIE
She saw the salad dressing She saw the salad dressing
SAM

I told you that one

107

MAGGIE
A thousand times

SAM
Really A thousand times

He stands straight still smiling but awkward not sure what
else to say

He turns and looks toward the house Grace stands inside the
sliding glass door to the kitchen staring at him

Sam walks toward the house He stops a few feet from the
glass door Grace makes no move to open the door

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sam sits on the sofa watching an old movie Grace comes
downstairs She sits beside her husband

Sam changes the channel A downhill skier slashes through the
snow on a mountainside in Switzerland

GRACE
Can‘t you tell me something Not
all of it but something

Grace picks up the remote and mutes the television

GRACE
Tell me

SAM
There’s nothing to tell
(staring at TV)
I sat in a dark room thinking I
thought about you About the time
we broke up I drove over to your
apartment to apologize

Grace smiles remembering

SAM
But you wouldn’t let me in

Sam picks up the remote and turns up the volume

on the edge of the bed staring at his hands

EXT APARTMENT COMPLEX -— DAY

The Mustang is parked in front of a drab apartment complex

INT MUSTANG — DAY

Sam sits in the driver’s seat wearing his dress uniform
Music plays quietly on the CD player He taps nervously on
the steering wheel not really keeping the beat Finally he
takes a deep breath and gets out

INT APARTMENT DAY

The door swings open CASSIE smiles at Sam With her
nose ring and black eyeliner she looks a little Goth-- and
not at all the kind of wife you’d picture for Joe Willis

She has a sweet smile though and she shows it to Sam

CASSIE
Hey Come in

Sam steps inside the apartment Cassie offers her hand and he
shakes it

CASSIE
Cassie

SAM
Sam

CASSIE

You want some coffee or something

109

SAM
Sure

Cassie leads Sam toward the kitchenette essentially a nook
alongside one wall of the living room

CASSIE
And of course the second I said
that I realize I don’t have any
coffee It sounds good to offer it

right
SAM
That’s okay
CASSIE
Apple juice I have lots of apple
juice
SAM
Sure
CASSIE

Thanks for calling first If you
just showed up at the door with
that uniform on I‘d probably have
a heart attack

Sam nods He seems uncomfortable and his awkwardness makes
Cassie nervous

CASSIE
But there’s no news right

SAM
(hesitating)
No I’m sorry No news

CASSIE
Don’t be sorry As long as we don’t
hear anything there’s still hope

Cassie opens the refrigerator door pulls out a family-size
bottle of apple juice and pours two glasses

Sam looks around the apartment The place is low rent but
there’s something warm about it framed family photographs
hanging on all the walls

Sam looks at a wedding picture of Cassie-- looking thinner
and far happier-- and Joe Willis Cassie sees Sam examining
the picture

110

CASSIE
Look at that goofball Can you
believe that’s the man I love

A baby cries out from the other room Sam turns at the noise
startled a haunted look in his eyes

CASSIE
Sorry give me one minute

Cassie hurries into the bedroom leaving Sam alone The
baby’s crying seems almost more than he can bear

INT APARTMENT - LATER

Cassie and Sam now sit at the little table by the
kitchenette Cassie holds Joe Junior a six-month-old The
baby stares at Sam with huge blue eyes

CASSIE
It’s nice of you guys to check up
on me Some of the wives came by
the first few months but I
don’t know I think it was too
depressing for them

Sam looks away from the baby’s searching blue eyes

SAM
I saw Joe over there

CASSIE
You saw him

SAM
We were in the same camp

CASSIE
But why why didn’t he come home
with you

Sam hesitates already feeling guilty for the lie he’s about
to tell

SAM
He was moved to another camp

Cassie searches Sam’s face anxious for every shred of news
about her husband

lili

CASSIE
But he’s alive He’s alive he’s
definitely alive

Sam is in too deep to pull out now but this deceit does not
come naturally for him If Cassie were not so desperate to
hear good news she would see how tortured Sam appears

SAM
When he he was moved to another
camp but the last time I saw him
he was fine
(beat)
He’s gonna make it

Joe Junior smiles at Sam and kicks his little legs

CASSIE
Shh it’s okay sweetie Daddy’s
coming home soon

SAM
He told me about you About Joe
Junior too He told me you were
taking your driver’s test

CASSIE
I failed

SAM
He said you would

CASSIE
Oh God I hit the other cars when
I was parallel parking I mean
both of them The one in front and
the one in back

SAM
He told me about your thumbs

Cassie shy hides away her lollipop thumbs

CASSIE
Joe Junior’s got ‘em too

SAM
He told me he was gonna teach Joe
Junior how to throw a football
someday

Cassie seems to think this is funny

CASSIE
He said that

SAM
Yeah I’m pretty sure

CASSIE
He was selling you one there
Joe’s not much of an athlete

SAM
(nodding at the baby)
Maybe I’11 teach him When he’s old
enough

CASSIE
(to her baby)
How’s that sound angel Captain
Cahill’s gonna teach you how to
throw a ball

She looks up at Sam smiling brightly though her eyes are
full of tears

CASSIE
We’ll have you over as soon as Joe
gets home We’ll have a big party

Sam can do nothing but smile back

concentrating on the task with no sign of emotion

INT DINING ROOM - LATER

The table looks quite festive with candles burning and
platters of food The adults are in the middle of an
argument Maggie marches her new doll across the tabletop

HANK
Today people need therapy when they
stub their toes These men are
soldiers They’re trained for it

SAM
(to Maggie sharp)
Put the doll away

CARLA
Maybe they’re not trained to see
people get shot

GRACE
What do you think they trained for

CARLA
Yes but

Grace stares at Carla waiting for an answer Tommy looks at
Grace curious about the sharp tone Sam sits quietly
showing no sign of interest in the conversation

Isabelle is sick of watching her kid sister play with her new
doll she tries to grab it away but Maggie holds on

SAM
(vaising his voice)
Stop it Isabelle Eat your dinner

Grace tries to head off Sam’s rising temper by speaking
softly to Maggie and taking away the doll

ISABELLE
(pushing back her chair)
I’m not hungry I want to watch TV

SAM
Eat your dinner

Isabelle stands and walks away heading for the living room

drags her back to the table

The table goes silent Sam returns to his own seat ignoring
his daughter For a long beat nobody speaks

GRACE
Izzy

ISABELLE
(to Sam)
Why are you taking it out on me
You’re just mad ‘cause Mom would
rather have sex with Uncle Tommy
than you

Grace stares at Isabelle She cannot believe those words just
left her daughter’s mouth

GRACE
Why would you say a thing like
that

ISABELLE
You and Uncle Tommy have sex all
the time

GRACE

That‘’s enough

Hank looks at Tommy So does Carla Sam watches his daughter
carefully gauging her words before looking at Grace

GRACE
She has no idea what she’s saying
(uncomfortable beat)
This is insane She’s just upset

Isabelle crying hurries away from the table This time no
one stops her

There is a very long very awkward silence

INT KITCHEN NIGHT

Sam sits alone at the kitchen table A half-—drunk bottle of
bourbon waits beside a glass

Sam pours himself a large glass and downs it His fingers tap
the tabletop as he stares into the bottle

He pours another glass finishes it pours another He kills
the bottle quickly

He continues to drum the tabletop with his fingertips
staring into space

He stands Once he is on his feet he hesitates as if he
hadn’t planned this far ahead

He looks around the stylish immaculate kitchen at the
lacquered cabinetry at the glass and subway tile and
stainless steel

He opens the flatware drawer stares at the forks and knives
He yanks the drawer out past its stops and hurls it against

over the garbage can throwing a bottle through the window
