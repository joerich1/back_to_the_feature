SMOKER
Thanks

In the shadows of a holding cell a faceless SMOKER slips
matches back through an opening in a steel door The
jailer moves away clearing a sight-line on a monitor in
the outside corridor The Smoker lingers to watch a
JUDGE on the screen as

After careful and studied review
of all evidence presented during
each phase of this proceeding it
becomes apparent that the

CAMERA FINDS KIMBLE the man whose life they just took
away He looks around with disbelieving eyes watching
it all happen to someone else watching the cuffs bite
down on another mans wrists watching them pull some
other prisoner toward the Door of No Return

KIMBLE
But it wasnt me I didnt kill
her

Already stepping down the Judge doesnt respond The
bailiff jerks Kimble to the dooor He struggles

KIMBLE
But I didnt do it

Another bailiff appears helping to manhandle Kimble out
of the courtroom
INT PHILADELPHIA COURTHOUSE - HOLDING TANK - DAY

and into this temporary cell The steel door closes
in his face

KIMBLE
I did not kill my own wife

It decays to silence Then calmly
SMOKER (0S)
Guess they just couldnt choke
that part about the one-armed man
Kimble turns to the faceless man in the corner
SMOKER (0S)

Sensing energy Kimble wakes Sees the cage door open
Young Guard moving back And across the aisle

Prisoner 2 is wagging his head between his knees Some-
thing slides out of his hi-top afro and CLANKS to the
dimpled steel floor Its a SHANK

Heart quickening Kimble looks forward Young Guard is
handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner 1 Kimble
snaps a look back at Prisoner 2 who palms the shank
His eyes say Shut the fuck up

Old Guard watches from the open door shotgun carelessly
ready

Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich
Kimble doesnt respond

YOUNG GUARD
Suit yourself

He offers the sandwich to Prisoner 2 In the exchange
sandwich drops Young Guard stoops for it

Up front Old Guard yawns again just as

Nowhere else to hide Prisoner 3 drops behind a seat
He fumbles for his loads

Old Guard jams his shotgun under the seat Prisoner 3
screams for mercy Old Guard pulls the trigger as
EXT OPEN LAND - MAGIC HOUR

The bus angles into a gravel embankment Roars up the
slope Begins to tip Continues on two wheels for an
unthinkably long distance then

INT MARSHALS BUS - MAGIC HOUR

CRASHES down on its side ENGINE DIES Dusty silence
We dont know up from down

On his knees Old Guard makes his way to the driver
Finds him dead as dead gets Now a SOUND Old Guard
whips his shotgun around at

Kimble Rising between seats

Hairy moment Old Guard might kill him just to finish
the hat trick But a GROAN turns Old Guards head

Its Young Guard trying to hold his guts in

OLD GUARD
(to Kimble)
You Cmere

He scrounges up a medical kit shoves Kimble down on
Young Guard

OLD GUARD
Youre a doctor Gotta do
somethin Gotta patch him up

Kimble looks at his cuffs In these Old Guard digs
out his key-ring and unlocks Kimbles hands -- only his
hands Kimble opens medical kit Its been ransacked

KIMBLE
Codeines gone And theres
nothing here I can use to close
a lacerated spleen He needs --

OLD GUARD
Just fuckin do something

KIMBLE
(quick turn-around)
Ill need something to clamp with
Clipboard Anything That visor
over there

Old Guard finds a clip on the sun visor Kimble confis-
cates a lighter from the Young Guards pocket starts
heating the clip sterlizing it And in this delicate
moment

A shiver runs through the bus Is it just settling
Having other things to worry about Kimble reaches down
inside the mans guts

Now a second shiver stronger Kimble retracts his hands
to touch a metal panel -- and feel a growing vibration

KIMBLE
Just where the hell are we

Old Guard feels it too He moves forward to put his eye
to an unbroken section of windshield

OLD GUARD
Oh shit

Like his life depended on it Old Guard begins beating on
the exit door embedded in the ceiling

OLD GUARD
Oh motherfucking shit
EXT RAILROAD TRACKS - MAGIC HOUR

The bus lies across railroad tracks A not too distant
bend grows bright by the light of an approaching train

EXT FREIGHT TRAIN - MAGIC HOUR

As the WHEELS BRAKE and lock

EXT RAILROAD TRACKS - MAGIC HOUR

Kimble struggles out of the bus -- pulling the Young
Guard behind him He slings the man clear

SCREECHING death the TRAIN SKIDS closer

For one heartbeat Kimble remains perched atop the bus
The train light X-rays him

Kimble leaps Lands Rolls Gains his feet Tries to
sprint away but cant His feet are still chained He
gets off a dozen mincing steps before

IMPACT A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS INTO the BUS
splitting it open

Shrapnel rips through Kimbles shoulder But he stays on
his feet still running feverish half-steps

An EXPLOSION envelopes the train Flames stream down its
flanks

The train burns past the wounded guard

Kimble looks back expecting to see the catastrophe behind

him But he gets the shock of his life -- of any mans
life
Still on its wheels the locomotive is derailing -- and

coming after him Its the stuff of nightmares One
little man being chased by a fire-breathing locomotive

The train burrows to a stop

Kimble is suddenly five feet taller standing on an
upheaval of earth staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the
train that nearly devoured him He pants Coughs on
smoke Then he notices something in his hand

Its the key-ring

EXT HILLSIDE - SUNRISE

Kimble appears just as the sun flares over the horizon
Ankle cuffs gone he runs animal free

Kimble glances behind him to behold

The falls ending in a great cauldron of mists No rocks
None visible anyway

Nearing Gerard shakes his head Youll never make it
Kimble hesitates -- and feels a hand clamping his wrist
His arm is twisted back in a hammerlock And just as
Gerard swings down with cuffs

Kimble torques away And jumps

INT MYOELECTRIC INSTITUTE - DAY

DIRECTOR
about 40 percent of our
clients are children -- largely

congenital birth defects Another
30 percent are adolescents the
rest adults Those are tough
ones Almost always trauma
victims -- car accidents
industrial accidents When an
adult loses a limb he loses his
sense of wholeness Usually some
bitterness there Even anger

A vital woman in her fifties the DIRECTOR of the
institute leads Kimble through a warren of offices and
corridors passing therapists and their patients We

see a girl fitted with a replacement leg walking the

hall experimentally a boy with a new hand doing gripping
exercises

DIRECTOR
But the kids are great Even if
they cant pronounce myoelectric
Never too soon to start them out

KIMBLE
Imagine it helps prevent scoliosis

DIRECTOR

Exactly

They reach a door The Director slips a perforated
key-card into an electronic lock The LOCK SNICKS open

INT MYOELECTRIC INSTITUTE - COSMETOLOGY - DAY

THROUGH a magnifier Kimble and the Director examine
the latex skin of a myo hand

DIRECTOR
See the detail The degree of
skin-folding corresponds to the
age of the client

KIMBLE
All customized then For every
patient

DIRECTOR

(nodding)
We can airbrush veins into the
skin gloss the fingernail
indentures even add hair
follicles After were done
here the casual observer should
see no difference between a real
limb and a myo limb And the
costs are coming down

(right at Kimble)
Its criminal to fit anyone with
a hook these days Just criminal

INT MYOELECTRIC INSTITUTE - DAY
MOVING again

KIMBLE
How often do clients come in
For refitting

longer if they take care of the

Long time

They reach the Research and Development door Again
the Director uses her perforated key-card to gain

Doug Meet Jim Reed Hes
going to help us get caught up
around here

RD MAN
None too soon Whats your
background Jim

KIMBLE
Working on my P-T certification
in Canada specializing in limb
deficiency Thought I should do
a little interning with
myoelectrics and of the three
or four firms in North America --
they tell me this is the biggest
if not the best

RD MAN
(to Director)
Really just need an engineer

DIRECTOR
(shrugging)
So hes overqualified Well
underpay him to make up for it

KIMBLE
I do have some engineering

RD MAN
Where was this

KIMBLE
Uh up in Calgary Just undergrad
stuff though

The RD Man throws a frown at the Director before looking
back to Kimble

RD MAN
Funny I grew up in Alberta --
and as far as I remember there
is no university in Calgary

KIMBLE
(half-beat)
Youre right there isnt But
there is a technical college

She hands Kimble a myo arm He stares at it

Of a similar arm he held months ago

CUT TO

BACK TO SCENE

DIRECTOR
Just slip your arm inside

Tentatively Kimble passes his own arm through the
shell of the myo arm his hand poking out a hole in
the wrist area Now Kimble has two right hands

DIRECTOR
Demo model for non-deficient
people Now flex your forearm
Like this

Kimble does The aluminum hand closes down over
his real hand Its a strange strange sight

RD MAN
When you flex electrodes pick up
the voltage in your muscle -- barely

a thousandth of a volt We amplify
that signal to drive the motors
Its all proportional too How
much you flex determines how hard

you grip

Kimble relaxes his forearm to open the aluminum hand
releasing his own hand

KIMBLE
Lotta pressure

RD MAN
Normal man grips at 18 PSI myo
hand goes 23 24 even 25 Trying
to give our clients a better grip
on things

wine He starts to rise

But a forearm flattens him

Going for the stairs the attacker tries to vault him
Kimble grabs a leg and twists him down The man kicks
free and tries again for the stairs This time Kimble
catches an arm

And rips it off the mans shoulder

Time dilates Kimble looks bug-eyed at the arm in his
hands to the mans unreadable face to the empty
sleeve of the mans coat and back to the arm

Its hollow EHlectrodes are visible inside

Before Kimble can recover the ONE-ARMED MAN snatches
back his arm and wallops Kimble with it He whirls
and pounds down the stairs We hear a DOOR BANG OPEN

history You provide a chance to
surrender If the fugitive doesnt
take it the law then obliges the
use of deadly force You shoot

And what was the nature of your
talk that evening

ADELLE
Helen He was concerned about
some things Apparently there
was some
(hating this)
excessive drinking on her
part and uh

And some lack of intimacy of
late He said he couldnt talk
to her about it I mean he had
tried -- he said he did -- but he
couldnt get anywhere Richard
just wanted to know if I had any
idea why shed been so upset

PROSECUTOR
Forgive me for not understanding
Miss St Clair but why should he
come to you to discuss such intimate

INT HALL OF JUSTICE - STAIRWELL - DAY

As Kimble descends

INT HALL OF JUSTICE - CORRIDOR - DAY
Gerard waits for an elevator Growing impatient he
finds a fire door
INT HALL OF JUSTICE - STAIRWELL - DAY

and starts upstairs INTERCUT WITH
Kimble Descending on a collision course
Gerard reaches a landing -- and skims shoulders with
Kimble who pivots past on his way down Amazingly
neither man reacts Not yet
One flight above Gerards subconscious taps him on
the shoulder and brings him to a dead stop Did I
just see what I think I just saw He leans over the

stairwell railing to spy

Kimble spiraling downward From his vantage it could be
any bearded man But still

GERARD
(a quick probe)
Kimble
Two landings below Kimble falters a step Should I

look up Does it give me away Never acknowledging
Kimble keeps moving

But Gerard is pulling his P9 The hitch in Kimbles
stride told him everything

GERARD
Kimble Next step is your last

Kimble blitzes down the stairs Gerard cant get a bead
He wheels around for a landing door -- and collides with
a Baltimore cop entering the stairwell
GERARD

Get on the phone call your

commander tell him theres a

top-ten warrant in the building

and I want the place sealed

and sealed now

He shoves the cop away and pounds downstairs

INT HALL OF JUSTICE - LOBBY - DAY

Kimble heaves open a fire door and starts across the
lobby Moving fast but not running Hoping to cloak
himself in civilians

The exit doors loom nearer and nearer

Suddenly a KLAXON HORN People stop in confusion
Automatically the exits doors begin closing

Kimble takes off Weaves through human statues Leaps
and does a home-plate slide into one of the closing

doors

And jams his hard-soled shoe into the crack bracing it
open

Other doors seal electronically

Across the lobby Gerard appears

Kimble fights the heavy glass door Its MOTOR GROWLS
back resisting him -- but slowly the crack widens
Limb by limb Kimble begins extruding himself outside

Gerard bulls through the crowd -- and sees

GERARD
Down down everybody down

Civilians suck the floor clearing a line-of-fire on

Kimble With adrenal effort he wrings his body through
the opening

EXT HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

and makes it outside And just when we think hes
clear

The door catches his foot like a bear trap
Harrowed Kimble looks back over his shoulder at

Gerard Charging the glass doors leveling his P9
Already in kill-range

If Kimble could chew off his leg right now he would

INT HALL OF JUSTICE - LOBBY - DAY

Gerard FIRES SEVEN TIMES in two seconds

EXT HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

Kimble goes down

INT HALL OF JUSTICE - LOBBY - DAY

SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby A long beat
then Gerard rises from the shooters stance Through
glass studded with bullet holes he sees

Kimble rising Staring back Equally astounded to be
alive

Gerard throws himself against the doors Sees cratering
in the glass -- and then sees flattened slugs all over
the floor Its bullet-proof glass

Wearing just one shoe Kimble runs free

of insulin shock Total stranger

Gerard gives her a stony look

JACKSON
He probably saved the guys life
GERARD
Were aware of his medical skills
thank you
JACKSON

Look As a detective it makes me
wonder if somethings sideways here
I mean its just not standard M0
for killers to go around saving lives
like Jesus on his donkey Now I

know its not my case but Id be
tempted to take one giant step
backwards and look into the
possibility that Kimble might not
actually --

Gerard steps into her

GERARD
Youre right about one thing Its
not your case And even if I had
it in Gods own handwriting that
Richard Kimble was innocent Id
still bring him in Because they
dont pay me to solve crimes
detective -- they pay me to hunt
down fugitives There is no
discretion It is the law

JACKSON
(beat)
Yeah I heard you could be a real
prick
GERARD

You heard right

She leaves shaking her head passing a property
SERGEANT carrying in boxes and bags

SERGEANT
Driscolls belongings

He dumps everything on a table Gerard and Biggs sort
through

BIGGS
Maybe Kimbles tryin to set this
guy up -- thinks he can force a

retrial Or maybe hes just

blown a head gasket Believes

his own story Tell a lie

enough times sooner or later

its gonna start sounding --
(recoiling)

Jesus Fuckmesus

A beat then they reapproach the box Biggs was opening
Inside is a human hand Gerard clears away packing
The hand is attached to a myoelectric arm

why hes interested in a one-armed

Each candle illuminates another family photo We see
St Clair posing with shotgun and deer

Helen and Adelle in the woods baskets brimming with
berries

St Clairs wife working in the cabin kitchen

And Helen Kimble and Adelle in front of the cabin
arms interwoven While Helen looks at the cameraman
Adelle looks up into Kimbles face adoringly --
revealingly Over these photos

WIDER to reveal Adelle

holding a candle over the envelope

KIMBLE
Dug it out of the trash

My

guess is that he still pulls
down a check every couple

weeks

ADELLE
Pennsylvania

KIMBLE

He worked there which means
there are more records there --
which means maybe we can place
him near Stafford the week of the

murder

ADELLE
You think thats enough

To

convince a district attorney

KIMBLE

Its all I have Will you help

Deliberating Adelle moves to the fireplace On the
mantle is a dried garland of berries and laurel

ADELLE
Mulberries Dad went after
deer we went after berries -- it

was the only kind of hunting we
could bring ourselves to do Oh
he used to get so mad when wed
have mulberries for dinner
instead of venison

She sniffs the garland The scent is gone
ADELLE

I tried to put things behind me
after the trial Richard -- those

accusations and just everything
I havent been back to Stafford

get involved

deal with when the time comes I
suppose

blinklessly

INT STAFFORD INN - HALLWAY - DAY

Kimble skulks down the hall Reaches room 130 Starts
to listen at the door but

Guests appear Kimble averts piddling with an ice-maker
until they vanish Now he moves back and lays an ear to
the door just as

GUNFIRE inside For a foot-rooted beat Kimble doesnt
know whether to stay or run And then

The door opens The One-Armed Man takes two absolutely
normal steps into the hall -- and crashes onto his face
Dead

Kimble hurdles him

INT STAFFORD INN - ROOM - DAY

and rushes inside Sees the window studded with
bullet holes Lunges there and spots

A fleeing shape Fractured glass obscures detail

Kimble rips down a drape wraps his hand punches out
the window He leans outside to get a better look at

An empty road

INT STAFFORD INN - HALLWAY - DAY

Kimble reappears and checks the One-Armed Man for vitals
People appear Horror gives way to fear as they see
Kimble hunched over the body They think hes the
killer As people run off Kimble grabs the body

INT STAFFORD INN - ROOM - DAY
and drags it inside the room Adelle materializes

ADELLE
Oh God what --

KIMBLE
Lock it Lock the door

She does Kimble rolls the body on its side draining
blood from the lungs And now with a black fire in his
eyes Kimble goes to work on the One-Armed Man

ADELLE
Richard --

KIMBLE
Search him Look for a phone
number Search him

She pulls what she can off the body as Kimble pounds on
the chest and breathes into the mouth

ADELLE
Those people Theyll call the
police

KIMBLE

Not gonna let him die Not now

ADELLE
But he is dead

KIMBLE
Nah He just thinks he is

He works rhythmically yet maniacally trying to save the
man who murdered his wife tug-of-warring with God for a
few more minutes of life Soon RISING SIRENS

ADELLE
Enough We have to go

She moves to the window Kimble keeps working

lll

ADELLE
Enough Richard Hes dead
Just leave him and get out of here
bef --

The One-Armed Man blinks alive He looks up into the
face of his unlikely savior

KIMBLE
Who is it Sykes Who were you
gonna meet

The One-Armed Mans eyes dart around the room looking
impossibly for escape

KIMBLE
Not gettin away not this time
Your lungs are shot -- literally

You cant breathe on your own
Now Ill give you a breath -- but
when you exhale I want somethin
back I want a name

He reinflates the One-Armed Mans lungs SIRENS COMING
COMING COMING And when the One-Armed Man finally
exhales -- all we hear is air

KIMBLE

Youre fuckin with me Sykes
Youre thinking I wont let you
die But Im not a doctor not

The One-Armed Man nods Another kiss of life from
Kimble SIRENS FADE right outside Cops are here

KIMBLE

The mouth opens to reveal its secret -- but instead of
words blood wells out overrunning the face and chest

us know you were coming home

ADELLE

Didnt know myself Dad

(indicating cabinet)
Funny Theres no employee file
for a man named Sykes Yet when
I pulled some old workmans comp
files -- from June of 83 -- I
found a duplicate claim with that
very name on it

St Clair takes a slow tour of the office side-glancing
into connecting rooms They seem empty

ST CLAIR
Sounds like someone made a
mistake Is that why you had me
come all the way up here To
discuss clerical errors

But you dont remember him

He was missing his right arm
Lost it in a firedamp explosion
in the Wilkesberry mine in 1983

Unfortunate -- but hardly unique
Coal mines are dangerous places

ADELLE
But if a one-armed man worked for
this company -- this family --
dont you think it should have
been brought out at the trial

ST CLAIR
Well maybe I didnt remember at
the time Or maybe I just didnt
think anybody would care about a
coincidence like --

ADELLE
Which was it

ST CLAIR

The seventh circle of hell The walls dance red here
reflecting some Stygian inferno burning deep within a
fissure that cuts this vast cavern in half An ancient
bridgework skirts the edge of the fissure And standing
at the opposite bank distorted by curtains of heat is
St Clair Adelle lies bleeding on the ground

Been burning for nearly twenty
years now Richard These mine

fires -- no one knows how they
start no one knows how to put
them out

He pitches the Dictaphone tape into the fissure Gone
Then the workmans comp files Gone Then the revolver
All gone All cremated

Its a complete mystery

Kimble edges to the bridgework a cats cradle of old
pipes and missing boards Is this how St Clair crossed

KIMBLE
What about me I know I know
the truth

Tell them what you want Richard
Maybe theyll believe you this

Death -- it makes all men perfect

If you dont believe it just
listen to the eulogies

KIMBLE
No St Clair It doesnt solve
anything

ST CLAIR

Thats what Im counting on
He walks for the edge
Making a blind run Kimble blitzes over the bridgework
Not daring to look down Reaching the midpoint and
speeding on Praying that momentum will carry him the
rest of the way even if his feet cant And then
A BOARD DISINTEGRATES underfoot

Kimble crashes waist-deep caught in the bridgework like
a pig on a spit He looks up powerlessly to see

St Clair reaching the edge of the fissure -- and
stepping off

BAM BAM BAM

Astonishment registers on St Clairs shattering face
Bullets are catching him in the head and shoulders
checking his forward inertia

BAM BAM BAM BAM

He totters at the edge for an impossibly long beat --
before the impacting bullets drive him back

BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM

Already dead St Clair somersaults back into darkness
Adelle falls to the ground Untouched

Gerard lowers his P9 He crosses the bridgework with
stalwart feet and reaches down offering his hand To
