CATHERINE
UmMaybe Im wrong but um Im

be a little trite Its earnestness
is wellits a little
embarrassing And those
adjectives theyre a little
flatfooted And redundant Im
sorry butAnyway what do I
know Dont even listen to what I
say I mean
MR SCOTT
Anyone else

No response

MR SCOTT

Catherine is right The storys a
piece of shit You express nothing
but banalities and formally
speaking are unable to construct
a single compelling sentence You
ride on a wave of clichés so worn
in fact it actually approaches a
level of grotesquerie Ad your
subtitle the rawness of truth
is that supposed to be a joke of
some sort Or are you just being
pretentious

(beat then checking his class book)
OK Whos next

EXT CAMPUS COURTYARD - DAY

console

Patronizing fuck If you had just
been honest with me in the first
place I wouldnt have read it I
knew it was shit But - idiot - I
believed you

VI
Thats not fair I was honest
Just because I wasnt sucking up
like that bitch Catherine

MARCUS
Well I sure didnt hear you voice
your opinion in there when it
mattered

VI
I admit it - I was scared I was
shocked in fact by what he
said And hes soconvincing
Im sorry if I let you down but
really I still say hes just
one opinion I dont even like his
books that much Theyre all so
aggressively confrontational I
dont care if hes won the
Pulitzer Prize

You just want to fuck him Like

EXT MARCUSS DORMITORY - NIGHT

Lights are out

INT MARCUSS DORM ROOM - NIGHT

MARCUS
Freak

There is a soft knock at the door He turns away from the mirror and
opens it Vi is there teary-eyed disheveled

VI
Can I come in

They embrace

MARCUS
Youre allsweaty

INT MR SCOTTS CLASSROOM - DAY
Vi finishes reading her story to the class

VI
So John flipped her around and
Silence

Pause

slammed her against the wall Jane
braced herself she thought about
her mother She thought about
Peter She thought about Godand
rape Say Fuck me nigger
Fuck me hard Johns flesh
abraded her soft skin There would
be marks She acquiesced and said
what he asked her to say and did
what he asked her to do She had
entered college with hope with
dignity but she would graduate as
a whore

AMY
Why do people have to be so
uglywrite about such ugly
characters Its perverted I know
you all think Im being prisssy
but I dont care I was brought up
in a certain way And this
ismean-spirited

JOYCE
Yeah well it did seem a little
affected Like by using taboo
language you were trying to shock
us about the hollowness of your
characters

ETHAN
I think it was a little bit
racist

ELLI
It was completely racist and
beyond that I felt deeply offended
asa woman As if a woman can
only operate from experiences of
objectification

SUE
Totally phallocentric

ELLI
And so weirdly misogynistic I
mean why does Jane go through
with this Is she stupid

ETHAN
Hey But wasnt this a rape Or
did I miss something Because I
- Im confused Because if this
Silence

was a rape then why would she be
a whore

CATHERINE

(beat)
It was confessional yet
dishonest Jane pretends to be
horrified by the sexuality that
she in fact fetishizes She
subsumes herself to the myth of
black male potency but then
doesnt follow through She thinks
she respects Afro-Americans she
thinks theyre cool ‘exotic
what a notch he d make in her
belt but of course it all comes
down to mandingo cliché and he
calls her on it In classic racist
tradition she demonizes then runs
for cover But then how could she
behave otherwise Shes just a
spoiled suburban white girl with a
Benneton rainbow complex Its
just my opinion and what do I
knowbut I think its a callow
piece of writing

MR SCOTT
Callow and coy Jane wants more
but isnt honest enough to admit
it In the end she returns to the
safety of her crippled
(translation sexually impotent)
boyfriend

MARCUS
This is bullshit Her story was
the truth

JOYCE
Right

SUE
Its unbelievable

ELLI
Its clichéd

AMY
Its disgusting

VI
But it happened

MR SCOTT
I dont know about what
happened Vi because once you
start writing it all becomes
fiction Still it certainly is an
improvement over your last story
There is now at least a beginning
a middle and an end

MR KIRK
I dont get it

TOBY
Well sir a lot has happened to
the landscape of the suburban high
school since I was a student and

perhaps even enlightening
endeavor to chronicle the
changes to get intimate with the
realities kids and parents face in
American schools today

MR KIRK
Yeah well whatever Ill let you
know if theres interest

Brady slaps him
FERN

Toby we need this to be a
positive experience

American today Its part
disillusionment part hope

YeahHow do we know we wont be
exploited

FERN
No its true

TOBY

Mr Livingston I fully understand
and I share your concerns You
fell vulnerable And I know that
this is a very difficult question
but what it comes down to is can
you make a leap of faith in me in
the same way that I have to make a
leap of faith in you

ON VIDEO INT EMPTY SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

VARIOUS

TOBY (VO)
Walking down these hallways just
like the ones I once walked down
as a teenager I couldnt help
thinking back to a time when every
day I woke up depressed suicidal
consumed by despair Had things
changed Was the competition to
get into the most prestigious
schools still a requisite rite of
passage Beneath these masks of
courtesy and friendliness I knew
that there were darker forces at
workand I knew that Scooby was
the key to revealing the truth

SHOTS OF SCOOBY

looking pensive

TOBY (VO)
Scooby Scooby ScoobyWhat are
you thinking College SATs your
parents your brothers your
friendsHow is it you deal with
all this stress

ON VIDEO INT CLASSROOM - DAY

A school psychologist sits at her desk

ELIZABETH ST CLAIR
The pressure to get into the
college of your choice is
incredible You know they did a
study recently of the youth in
Bosnia during the bombing and
they found that the stress the
young people experienced there was
less than what American high-
school students go through when
applying to college

TOBY (OS)
Is that right

ELIZABETH ST CLAIR
Yes

TOBY (OS)
Oh my God

INT EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

Toby and his editor examine the footage on an AVID

are to your subject

TOBY
No but I like my subject I like

When the sky is clear and the sun

a sign

a
is warm youre reminded of how
beautiful things can be a lamp
post a sign a straw wrapper
blowing in the windBut when that
dark cloud appears you realize
how fragile the balance of life
is The neurologist Dr Barry Jordan discussing Bradys condition

DR JORDAN

When Brady first arrived at the
hospital he was unresponsive to
verbal stimuli Wee performed a CT
scan which demonstrated a large
subdural hemotoma with mass
effect Since the removal of the
subdural hes been in coma A psychologist discussing the effect of the Brady crisis on his
family

DR GOODMAN
When I first met the Livingstons
it was in the first twenty four
hours of Brady coming in after his
tragic football accident and they
were acting in a fairly typical
way The Livingstons consulting with Dr Goodman in a hospital waiting
room

MARTY
Were not the ones who need the
help My son needs help

DR GOODMAN
And you-

MARTY
My sons in there He cant even
feed himself he cant eat - I

this effect him What meaning is
to be found in this

INT EDITING ROOM - DAY

Toby and his editor finish watching this latest footage
EDITOR
This is definitely better

TOBY
You think so You dont think that
this might not be a little dry

EDITOR
This is entertainment youre
making Toby This story about a
kid in the suburbs and the state
of the college admissions process
has with this Brady crisis
evolved into something much richer
and more provocative

TOBY
Yes I knowBut still it should
be somewhat entertaining

EDITOR
I mean without this footage
without this rigorous
documentation it would feel
like exploitation

TOBY
No no no No exploitation This
is seriousBut dont you find it a
little funny too at the same
time

EDITOR
Youve got a family tragedy on
your hands Will you tell me
whats funny about that About a
kid in a coma

TOBY
Nothing I guess

EDITOR
I mean why are you making this
documentary if you cant treat
your subject with appropriate
gravity

TOBY

OK youre right youre right

(beat)
You know we need to screen what
weve gotinvite some regular
people just some random off-the-
street typesand see what real
people think of this
EDITOR
I dunno Toby We really have a
long way to go You still need a
lot more footage and its
probably a little premature to
start screening

TOBY
OK then we can invite serious
intellectual types

EDITOR
Were not ready

TOBY
Hip alternative types who will
understand the process better

EDITOR
Were not ready

TOBY
Well I need to see this with an
audience

EDITOR
Whats an audience going to tell
you

TOBY
I dont know Maybe theyll like
it
