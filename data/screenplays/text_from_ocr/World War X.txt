FADE IN

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN - SUNSET

A WHITE STAR STEAM SHIP breaches a rough patch of ocean

We RISE ABOVE THE BOW to reveal a hundred EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS
crowded against the port side railing their hopeful faces
auburn from setting sun

Nortn Atlantic Ocean - 1915

These immigrants are all men broad-shouldered and imposing
with square jaws and sharp GREEN EYES They could be brothers

A distant lilting WOMAN’S VOICE sings an Irish lullaby
YOUNG MOTHER (VO)
(singing)
TIS THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER
LEFT BLOOMING ALONE
ON THE MAIN DECK
YOUNG BOYS play marbles on a floor that won’t stay level
YOUNG MOTHER (VO) (contd)
--ALL HER LOVELY COMPANIONS
ARE FADED AND GONE
IN THE SHIP’S HULL

Long rows of blankets mark territory for each family The
WOMEN are pale and sick not made for this kind of voyage

YOUNG MOTHER (OS)
--WHEN TRUE HEARTS LIE WITHERED
AND FOND ONES ARE FLOWN

A BABY BOY cries as his blue-eyed YOUNG MOTHER rocks him
against the harsh movement of the ocean singing softly

YOUNG MOTHER (cont’d)
---OH WHO WOULD INHABIT THIS
BLEAK WORLD ALONE
CRACK Mother and child react to a LOUD NOISE ABOVE
ON THE MAIN DECK

A glimmering FIREWORK sparkles above the ship TWO BROTHERS
near the bow watch the raining shards of light on the water

BROTHER 1
You see brother It is a great country
They scan the horizon for the gilded torch of Lady Liberty
but instead they see a SMALL BOAT WITHOUT SAILS

The MASKED RAIDERS aboard this boat are dressed in black Each
holds a silver REVOLVER and a razor sharp PENDULUM BLADE

BROTHER 2
Take the children below deck

CLANK A GRAPPLING HOOK finds its grip on the port railing

CLANK CLANK Two more grappling hooks starboard They are
completely surrounded

The immigrant men SNAP INTO ACTION ordering their sons below
deck They draw pistols from beneath their coats and OPEN
FIRE on the Masked Raiders as they BOARD THE SHIP

The Raiders shoot the men point blank before brutally
SEVERING THEIR SPINES with steel blades Bodies hit the deck
with faces frozen in surprise glowing firework embers
falling around them like burning snow

In the time it takes to boil water fifteen are dead
ON THE MASKED LEADER

Taller than the others a warrior’s build like we haven’t
seen since the fall of Rome He signals his men toward the
cabin door

IN THE HULL

The cabin door CREAKS OPEN and a pair of HEAVY BOOTS descend
the steps Mothers scatter into dark corners covering their
children’s mouths to silence them Our YOUNG MOTHER wraps her
baby in a blanket to muffle his cries

The Masked Leader CRACKS A FLARE revealing a thick crowd of
women and children cowering in fear

He walks slowly toward the muted cries of the infant boy and
wraps his enormous gloved hands around the baby The Young
Mother HOLDS TIGHT choking on tears

YOUNG MOTHER
Noplease

MASKED LEADER
Let him go

His voice is warm and reassuring yet resolute The Young
Mother runs a finger along her baby’s cheek for the last time
as the man TAKES IT FROM HER

He hands the child to a lithe muscular FEMALE RAIDER She
freezes staring at the young mother crumpled on the floor
MASKED LEADER (cont’d)
Go now

The Female Raider wraps the baby in a blanket and climbs the
stairs The Masked Leader takes one last look at the dirty
tearful facesthen STOMPS out the flare

YOUNG MOTHER
NoNO

The Young Mother BREAKS FREE of others trying to restrain
her We FOLLOW HER up the stairs to the locked cabin door

She BASHES HER SHOULDER up against it throwing all her
weight a weapon of fury now screaming and spitting with
every heave until it BREAKS OPEN to

THE MAIN DECK

where she’s faced with the LIFELESS BODIES OF EVERYONE SHE
KNOWS collapsed and still

She stumbles over them to the port railing as the last of the
boats disappear into the fog her infant’s cry growing
distant fast

A moment of breathless horror blood washing over her bare
feet as it sloshes from bow to stern

--and the ENTIRE SHIP EXPLODES IN A BILLOWING CONCUSSION
BLAST OF FLASH-MOLTED STEEL AND FIRE

EXT NEW JERSEY SHORE —- DAY

A misty grey morning A YOUNG GIRL 6 pig-tailed and muddy
builds a sea turtle out of sand

A ROCKING HORSE washes ashore She runs to it only to notice
more debris along the beachdoll’s heads burnt wood and
scattered clothesand a WOODEN TRUNK

The girl approaches it and cautiously LIFTS THE LID The
hinges SNAP She JUMPS BACK as it falls to the sand

INSIDE THE STEAM TRUNK

An INFANT BOY on a stack of wool blankets clothes ripped and
torn sharp green eyes wet with tears

ON THE YOUNG GIRL

Stunned and breathless She kicks off her sandals and runs up
the beach toward a beautiful Victorian home

A tiny fist makes BRUTAL CONTACT with a bully’s jaw
St Christopners Scnool For Boys - 1926

Cheering CATHOLIC SCHOOLBOYS surround THOMAS WADE 10 a green
eyed scrapper with blood on his knuckles The BULLY he’s
fighting is thicker and taller nearly 17

SCHOOLBOYS
Club him Tom Kill the bastard

The Bully SWINGS WILDLY but can’t touch Thomas ducking and
weaving like a middleweight He SWEEPS THE BULLY’S KNEES and
the Goliath FALLS Thomas follows him down and PINS the kid’s
gravel-scraped cheek to the pavement

THOMAS
Say uncle

BULLY

Tom lifts him by the hair and CRACKS his face on the cement
The bully’s nose EXPLODES BLOOD

BULLY (cont’d)
Uncleuncle

Thomas props the Bully’s head up at a group of THIRD GRADERS
standing around a SMALLER BOY with a bloody lip

TOM
Leave my friends alone or I’‘1ll break

Thomas DECKS HIM one last time and the bully SPITS TEETH
INT HEADMASTER’S OFFICE - DAY

FATHER WILSON a bleary-eyed Catholic Priest sits across
from ARNOLD AND MARGARET WADE Thomas’ adopted parents

FATHER WILSON
Righteous or not Ma’am we can’t
have violence at St Christopher’s

ARNOLD
Then punish him Cane him if you have
to There’s no need for expulsion

FATHER WILSON
They’re all boys Mr Wade Yours
nearly paralyzed one twice his size
Margaret can no longer hold back her tears

ARNOLD
He has a temper But he’s been to so
many schools nowsurely the Lord
can help

FATHER WILSON
Perhaps But there are clergy trained
to rid a soul of the devil

Arnold’s eyes become steel

ARNOLD
My son is not possessed

Father Wilson glares ominously back at him

FATHER WILSON
Oh there is something wicked in him
Mr Wade Of that you can be certain

EXT SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME

Arnold and Margaret exit Father Wilson’s office to find
Thomas waiting in the hall face scratched with dried blood
Arnold puts an exhausted hand on the boy’s head

ARNOLD
Hey who needs these guys huh Bunch
of old gasbags

Thomas cracks a smile He loves this guy Margaret shoots her
husband a look He knows what must be done

ARNOLD (contd)
Thomaswhat if your Mother and I
taught you your subjects at home
Would you like that

Thomas is confused Margaret kneels beside her son and peers
into his green eyes

MARGARET
I know they’re wrong about you
You’re not a bad boy you’re good
through and through You hear me
(convincing herself)
You’re good

Margaret wipes away her tears with a gloved hand takes the
boy’s hand and the family exits into the harsh midday sun

The light BLEEDS until it fills the frame

WORLD WAR X

CENTRAL PARK

A low fog blankets the Great Lawn European Nannies push the
first batch of Baby Boomers along wooded footpaths

the Yellow Cabs clogging the arteries of this living metropolis

FINANCIAL DISTRICT

Dense crowds of GI’s home from a freshly won war walk to new
jobs in grey flannel suits NEWSBOYS hawk the day’s Times
NAVY SHIPS WELCOME PRESIDENT TRUMAN FOR VICTORY CELEBRATION

This 1945 is desaturated and cold overexposed in places an
aesthetic we commonly associate with a dystopian future It’s
a bold and arresting take on a time we thought we knew

INT DINER - W 86TH AND BROADWAY - DAY

MEN IN TRENCHCOATS sit shoulder to shoulder at the counter
while lipsticked WAITRESSES pour coffee like they give a damn

We TRACK along the counter to TOM WADE now 31 square jaw
made more striking by his sharp green eyes There’s a decency
behind these eyes but also something that makes you wonder
if pushing this guy too far is really a good idea

Tom sips coffee with one hand while circling news stories in
pencil with the other The WAITRESS sets down a plate of
greasy eggs-in-toast

WAITRESS
Don’t you have to read the paper you
work for Tom

TOM

She opens the NY DAILY MIRROR resting on the counter

DING A new customer ducks in from the cold Tom spots the
man’s reflection in the chrome countertop--NYPD uniform He
moves the newspaper off the empty plate beside him

OFFICER MCGRADY mid-50’s thick and Irish fills the seat

TOM

TOM

Tom slides an envelope across the counter McGrady checks the
contents Cash His leathery mouth curls into a smile

MCGRADY (cont’d)
Robbery down at the Navy Yard
Somebody blew a hole in the USS
Yosemite the size of a Chevrolet

Tom scribbles notes on a handheld pad

TOM
Why would anyone steal from the Navy

MCGRADY
Maybe they pulled it off before
Maybe they got casaba-size globes

WAITRESS (0S)
Andthe usual

The Waitress sets down a plate of cream cheese and bacon
MCGRADY
Thanks doll

Tom’s coolness cracks a bit

TOM

MCGRADY
Musta been some kinda trouble Army

TOM
Not because of that
(taps his chest)
Bad ticker They call it a murmur

MCGRADY

TOM
No thanks
(checks his watch)
Got an angle on this crime scene

MCGRADY

Tom chugs the last of his coffee and puts on his fedora

TOM

(to the Waitress)
Put him on my tab huh

MCGRADY
Class act Rockefeller

As Tom rises from the counter he notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
WOMAN watching him from a booth

She casually averts her eyes like she wasn’t looking
Tom smiles to himself He’s seeing things again
EXT BROOKLYN NAVY YARD - DAY

COPS and DETECTIVES swarm beneath the USS YOSEMITE a massive
Navy cargo ship with a GAPING HOLE on the port side hull
EXT PORT 57 - GUARD BOOTH - SAME

Tom approaches a pair of SHORE PATROL GUARDS at the gate and
confidently holds up a dubious ID card

They wave him through

ON THE PIER

Cops hover over two destroyed NAVY JEEPS flipped and
blackened crisped to the core FORENSIC DETECTIVES examine
the smoking wreckage stumped

Tom gets close enough to eavesdrop

DETECTIVE
--they took out two Willys no shell
casings no prints You boys get
robbed by a pack of ghosts

COMMAND INVESTIGATOR
What do ghosts want with uranium No
these guys knew what they were after

Tom scribbles the details on his notepaduranium

He notices the Shore Patrolmen walking quickly toward him
followed by their SUPERIOR OFFICER clearly furious

SHORE PATROLMAN 2
Alright wiseguy let’s see your badge

Tom holds up his ID keeping it at a distance

SHORE PATROLMAN 1
That ain’t no press badge

TOM
Suppose there’s not much harm I can

do then Say you let me have a look
around

SHORE PATROLMAN 2
Say I give your nose a break

The MP PUSHES TOM who unexpectedly ABSORBS THE FORCE without
stumbling A startling ANGER blazes in his eyesthen
subsides as he realizes the odds are stacked deep

COMMAND INVESTIGATOR
Any trouble here

TOM
Just doing the people’s work
gentlemen No trouble at all

Tom pockets his notepad and cautiously exits the crime scene

EXT UNDER THE PIER - MOMENTS LATER

Tom climbs down a rusted ladder to a small dock below the
pier The charred black cavity in the SHIP’S HULL is visible
from here still smoking

He takes out his Leica and snaps away
POV - CAMERA VIEWFINDER

A few quick STILLS of the blasted steelbroken shipping
crates floating among the burnt projectiles

--and a LEATHER BOUND BOOK

Tom shoulders his camera and LIFTS HIMSELF UP onto the
support rafters beneath the pier He hangs down by his knees
stretches his arm to the waterand GRABS THE BOOK

EXT NAVY YARD - MOMENTS LATER

Tom climbs up the ladder and walks briskly away lifting his
eyes from the pavement just long enough to notice a pair of
BLACK OLDSMOBILE COUPES parked at the guard booth

Four OSS AGENTS in black suits emerge from the cars They
FLASH CREDENTIALS and enter the crime scene without slowing

One of them makes quick EYE CONTACT with Tom He quickly
looks away and continues toward the subway

INT NY DAILY MIRROR NEWSROOM - DAY

Tom enters a vast room of clicking TYPISTS and PROOFREADERS
He shuffles to a small desk and sits Nobody looks up

Tom removes the leather book from his pocket and runs a
finger over the raised symbol on the cover a bolt of
lightning crossed with a sword over an oil lamp

MR SELIG (OS)
You hear they found that missing girl
in Greenpoint Wade

MR SELIG Tom’s short rotund SUPERVISOR is over his shoulder

MR SELIG (cont’d)

Some Polack had her in his basement
Normally we’d run with juice like
that but today we got scooped by the
Daily Mail Why Because the story
was sitting here

(on Tom’s desk)
--waiting to be proofed

TOM
I was following a lead sir

MR SELIG
A lead I’m sorry are you a reporter
for this paper

TOM
Times change

MR SELIG
Oh you got moxy huh Well how’s
this for news I got a call this
morning said you were down at the
Navy Yard flashing a press badge

TOM
I had the beat on a story

MR SELIG
You had the beat on an accidental
detonation of fireworks I got a wire
from the US government saying so

TOM
And you believed them

MR SELIG
Wade you came to me with no formal
education and a brief but colorful
history of violence All I wanna know
is can you do the easiest job at
this paper

GLORIA (0S)
It was my fault sir

Selig spins around to face GLORIA mid 20’s a mousy typist
in a floral print dress

GLORIA (cont’d)
I misspelled Pierogi He just got the
copy five minutes ago

Selig glares at her with unmasked contempt

MR SELIG
I take it back Wade You have the
second easiest job at this paper

Gloria absorbs the dig boldly indifferent Selig exhales and
disappears into the newsroom bustle

GLORIA
Maybe his wife doesn’t speak English
Feels like the only way it could work
(over Tom’s shoulder)
Sohow about that lead

TOM
(without looking up)
It’s nothing Never mind

GLORIA
Hey come on don’t let a jerk like
that get you down

TOM
NoI’d just rather keep this lead a
secret Gloria I wasn’t going to
tell him anyway

Tom rolls paper into his Underwood and starts typing Gloria
backs off a bit disappointed

When she returns to her desk Tom sneaks the leather book out
from under his jacket and stuffs it in his bag

INT EXAM ROOM - DAY

A BALDING DOCTOR takes a drag on his cigarette and listens to
Tom’s heart with a stethoscope

DOCTOR
Yep still there Like a broken
record You been eating well Meat
starches dairy

TOM
Every day You ever think maybe
there’s nothing wrong with me

DOCTOR
I wouldn’t get your hopes up The
heart’s a stubborn sumabitch

Tom smiles just enough to be polite and moves on

INT APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Tom enters his lobby brushing past CLEVON mid-30’s black
the building’s lone handyman

CLEVON
Evening Mister Wade

TOM
How’s that girl of yours Clevon

CLEVON
Mighty fine sir

Clevon continues polishing watching Tom until he disappears
around the corner

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Tom enters and drops his keys This cluttered room has been
lived in for many years with no sign of a woman’s touch

We PAN AROUND to reveal walls pocked with DENTS AND HOLES in
the plaster the kind you make with a fist

INT KITCHEN - LATER

Tom opens the oven and removes a baking sheet with two
steaming potatoes and the LEATHER BOUND BOOK pages now dry

WALTER WINCHELL (VO)
(ON RADIO)
The same thing happened today that
happened yesterday only to
different people

Tom dumps the potatoes on a plate CRUSHES OPEN each one with
a tenderizing mallet and douses them with ketchup

He sets his food on a card table and opens the book to the
first page with his butter knife

INSERT - LEATHER BOOK

Two hundred pages of a COMPLEX FOREIGN LANGUAGE The symbols
are jagged and intricate no alphabet of ours

ON TOM

Flipping through the pages with a fascination he’s granted
little else in 30 years Deep inside he finds a small entry
in handwritten ink vertical along the seam 423-LISPEN6

Tom reaches into a nearby drawer and takes out a map of
Manhattan He follows Sixth Avenue south to a familiar cross
street and scribbles down an address423 Lispenard at 6th

EXT DOWNTOWN - BROADWAY —- DAY

The frame EXPLODES with a shimmering blizzard of tickertape
descending on 50000 NEW YORKERS

It is OCTOBER 27 1945 - NAVY DAY IN MANHATTAN

This grand parade is in honor of PRESIDENT TRUMAN visiting
today for the week of fleet celebrations

ON TOM

Moving through the dense crowd of civilians in long coats and
hats almost identical at first glance

The crowd dissipates as he turns the corner and walks west on
Lispenard a comparatively empty street of warehouses

EXT WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Tom finds the address on his notepad and ducks into an alley
across the street He waits in the shadows watching the door
while the roaring crowd echoes from up Broadway

Suddenly it opens and a TALL MAN in a black trenchcoat walks
down the front steps

He’s a few years older than Tom broad-shouldered and
imposing even at a distance His trenchcoat billows as he
walks determinedly toward the parade

Tom waits for him to get a few lengths away then follows
EXT CANAL ST - DAY

The Tall Man moves at a clip through the crowd Tom follows
as fast as he thinks he can periodically checking his pulse
Don’t overdo it

The Tall Man STOPS at an intersection turns back and looks
right at us His face is ABSTRACTLY FAMILIAR Square jaw
sharp green eyesnot unlike Tom

When the traffic cop signals walk he turns and walks briskly
into the crowd

TOM
Hey Stop

But the Tall Man doesn’t stop And though he isn’t quite sure
why Tom has no choice but to follow

EXT BROADWAY - DAY
The parade is in FULL SWING as the Tall Man rounds the corner

and WEAVES through the raucous scores of civilians He is
alarmingly quick and agile

Tom does the same with far less grace still managing to stay
within ten yards of his markthen the Tall Man hurdles the
barricade and RUNS INTO THE PARADE

Tom PURSUES HIM into the chaotic blizzard of ticker tape The
Tall Man cuts through a MARCHING BAND ducking in and out of

rows barely missing the sliding trombones paper falling so

thick he can’t make out more than ten yards ahead

Tom pushes through the band not so lucky colliding with
bass drums and knocking trumpets sideways

He emerges in time to see the Tall Man TAKE OFF RUNNING at a
speed that isn’t quite human

Something inside Tom SHIFTS INTO GEAR A deep all-consuming
need to know that LIGHTS HIM UP His trenchoat billows and he
RUNS FLAT OUT in pursuit

The Tall Man LEAPS onto moving cars jumping from one to
another without fear Tom forces his way through a dense
group of NURSES struggling to keep an eye on his target
expecting his heart to fail him at any moment

He’s losing himTom has to do better

He breaks free of the crowd and JUMPS UP onto a moving car
The Tall Man is three cars away now barely visible through
the ticker tape

Tom LONG JUMPS from one Cadillac to the next gainingbut
not for long Up ahead the Tall Man RUNS UP THE SIDE OF A
MOVING FLOAT He speeds across the platform and HURDLES to
the next one

Tom leaps off the last Cadillac and tries to SCALE THE FLOAT
after him but he can’t match this guy He falls to the
asphalt vision obscured by the dense confetti

The Tall Man stands high atop the float as it passes a lamp
post jumps out to it SWINGS once around to build momentum
and VAULTS OVER THE CROWD

--landing with a THUD on the cement beyond the layer of
civilians lining Broadway

ON TOM
Stunned by what he just saw

POLICEMAN (OS)
You Stop right there

A collection of NYPD closing in He can’t lose this guy now

He DIVES into the dense crowd PUSHING HIS WAY to the other
side He breaks through spots the Tall Man turning a corner
and CONTINUES AFTER HIM

We MOVE WITH TOM as he runs faster than he ever thought he
could The Tall Man checks over his shoulder as Tom closes on
himthen turns the corner onto the pedestrian walkway of
the BROOKLYN BRIDGE

EXT BROOKLYN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

We FLY OVER THE ACTION as Tom chases the Tall Man over the
wood-planked walkway

When he reaches the first tower the Tall Man hops the steel
girders and swings out on a suspension cable his body
hanging above the choppy water

Tom slows gasping for air The Tall Man yells to him over
the sound of speeding cars below

TALL MAN
You’re fast
TOM
(breathless)

Who are youwhy did you run

TALL MAN
I had to see for myself

TOM
See what

The Tall Man turns his back on Tom

TOM (cont’d)
NoWAIT

He JUMPS We follow his GRACEFUL PLUNGE from the bridge

---SMACK onto the deck of a PASSENGER FERRY passing beneath
it He sticks the landing with both feet and doesn’t stumble

The Tall Man looks up at Tom and SMILESthen he hops down
to the passenger deck and blends in with the crowd

Tom feels his heart beating like a machine gun He should be
dead right now

But he’s never felt more alive
INT DINER - 86TH AND BROADWAY - MORNING
Tom sits in the same spot at the counter this time with the

leather book he discovered at the Navy Yard On the front
page of the Times Navy Day FIREWwoRKs DAMAGE SHIP

He impatiently checks his watch as the waitress refills his
coffee cup

TOM

WAITRESS

Tom looks around the diner finger tapping impatiently on the
counter not sure whether or not to wait

EVELYN (0S)
Excuse me is this seat taken

Tom turns to find himself facing the beautiful woman he
caught watching him from the corner booth the other morning

EVELYN PRICE is not yet 28 Her eyes are smoky her voice a
soft velvet with a palpable confidence beneath it the way
your grandmother sounded when she was hot

EVELYN (contd)
Sorry to be rude but if I don’t make

Tom moves the newspaper covering Officer McGrady’s plate

policeman friend

She notices the leather book on the counter

EVELYN (contd)
Say what do you have there

TOM

EVELYN

TOM

Evelyn eyes the book almost like she wants to reach out and
grab it Tom puts it back in his coat

EVELYN
You have green eyes It’s rare you
know Lucky

For a moment the room feels quietthen their connection is
broken by the DING of the front bell

Tom stands

TOM
I should go

EVELYN
Maybe I’1l see you here again

TOM
Don’t know I might be too dangerous
for this place
EVELYN

You don’t seem so bad to me

Tom puts on his fedora and gets out while he’s still good

glow of a wood fire

McGrady enters with Tom and removes his hood

There are FOUR MEN in this parlor each in a burgundy smoking
jacket with a pipe or a glass of scotch They vary in age but
their faces look subtly similar like they share a parent

Tom recognizes one of them as the Tall Man he chased through
the parade His name is NESMITH

NESMITH

The other two raise their pipes ANTHONY 23 smaller than his
peers and MARSHALL 34 thick-necked and thinly mustached

Until now we believed there were no
survivors

ON TOM
looking around at the eerily familiar faces on the wall

TOM
Who are you

MCGRADY
We’re a bloodline of chosen men Tom
A Brotherhood here to save the world
from a gathering evil

Tom GRABS A FIRE STOKER sharp end touching McGrady’s throat

NESMITH
Told you he was fast

TOM
You’re no brotherhood you’re
thieves You stole uranium

MCGRADY
Obscurum stole that uranium We tried
to stop them and failed

TOM
Obscurum

NESMITH
The Shadow Axis The connective
tissue that binds our enemies
together

MCGRADY
The Nazis The Japs Mussolini What
do they have in common Obscurum
orchestrated this war And if they
aren’t defeated America will lose
everything she fought so hard to win

TOM
Hitler wouldn’t take orders from
anyone

MCGRADY

Obscurum’s power runs deep beyond
anything the Fuhrer understands
That’s why we need you With our
Brothers united we can defeat them

TOM
I don’t believe it

MCGRADY
If proof is what you need

McGrady nods to Marshall He puts a hand on Anthony’s shirt
collar and pulls it down to reveal a RED RORSCHACH-LIKE
BIRTHMARK on the back of his neck It spreads out as it
disappears into the hairline

MCGRADY (cont’d)
We are all marked with the sign

The expression on Tom’s face CHANGES He has seen this mark
before His whole life

NESMITH
Tomthat emptiness you’ve felt your
entire lifeit’s a part of you
that’s unfulfilleda truth
Tom instinctively puts a hand on the back of his neck
pulling his collar down enough for us to see a slight
variation of the SAME MARK

MCGRADY
We lost you once before Never again

Tom lowers the fire stoker worn down His existential
nightmare is all over his face

MCGRADY (cont’d)
When you’re ready to know who you
really are well be waiting

Marshall passes something in front of Tom’s eyes that FLASHES
and he BLACKS OUT

EXT CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY
Tom wakes up in his clothes

He is alone in the center of this open field blades of grass
silver with November frost

Tom sits up head aching He spots a NANNY with a baby
carriage watching him from a nearby footpath

--then the previous night’s events come RUSHING BACK
Tom stands and walks quickly out of the park

INT APARTMENT LOBBY - MORNING

Tom enters passing Clevon fixing a floor tile

CLEVON
You expecting company Mr Wade

Tom freezes

TOM
What makes you say that
CLEVON
There’s two men waiting outside your

door They friends of yours

On his guard Tom steps into the stairwell and looks up to
the third floor

The two OSS AGENTS are waiting outside his door
He backs slowly away

TOM
You know whatI forgot something

Tom exits quickly without looking up Clevon’s expression
doesn’t change It’s almost like he’s not surprised

EXT FIFTH AVENUE — DAY

Tom moves through a rolling sea of fedoras wanted by the law
and effectively homeless

He shuffles across a busy street to find himself facing
ST PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL

A truly majestic structure unchanged over centuries He
walks up the front steps and enters

INT CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS

The ethereal beauty of this space creates an instant calm A
rehearsing CHILDREN’S CHOIR echoes from the dias

Tom walks down the center aisle crosses himself and looks up
at the intricate stained glass window Sunlight pours
throughbut its beauty offers no answers

Then he spots a familiar face among the faithful EVELYN
seated alone a few rows down

EXT CATHEDRAL STEPS - DAY
Evelyn walks briskly toward the sidewalk Tom exits running

TOM
Evelyn

She turns surprised to see him

EVELYN
Tom Well I’11 be

TOM
I didn’t want to bother you in there
butI thought if you weren’t busy
I could buy you a cup of coffee

EVELYN
That’s awful nice of you Thing is
I’m late for work

TOM
A walk then Wherever you’re going
See I don’t know too many people so
when I’ve got a problem I talk to
strangers Do you mind

Evelyn smiles a little She doesn’t mind at all
EXT PARK AVENUE —- DAY

Tom and Evelyn walk together It’s a frigid day and their
breath puffs steam

EVELYN
Another war You’d have to be
suicidal to fight our boys right now

TOM
They say it’s a shadow element
Organized the Axis powers in secret

EVELYN
That’s quite a feat And what does
this “Obscurum” want now

TOM
Revenge They’re in America planning
some kind of invasion

EVELYN
So any Tom Dick or Harry could be

Evelyn looks cautiously around at the passing civilians

TOM
One of them

EVELYN
And you’re ready to join these
vigilantes fight an enemy no one’s
ever heard of no questions asked

TOM
My whole life I felt differentlike
I was lost in the dark

EVELYN
We all feel that way sometimes

TOM
No this is different I know it’s
crazy butI believe it Every word

EVELYN
Then nothing I can say will change
your mind
EXT CHRYSLER BUILDING - DAY

Evelyn and Tom stand outside the chrome-plated entrance He
stares up at the towering edifice

TOM

EVELYN
Yep They talk I type the world turns

TOM
Nowhere to go but up

She smiles at him charmed then KISSES his cheek

TOM (cont’d)
What was that for

EVELYN
Luck

CRASH A garbage can falls over in the alley nearby A MAN IN
A BROWN SUIT can be seen walking away from the overturned
can Evelyn glances toward the commotion visibly unsettled

EVELYN (contd)
Goodbye Tom

She holds her hand up in farewell then blends in with the
crowd moving like a bloodstream through the revolving doors

INT DINER —- DAY

Tom sits in his regular spot at the counter unable to touch
his eggs-in-toast

WAITRESS
You okay kid Food’s getting cold

TOM
SorryI guess I’m not hungry

WAITRESS

She sets a bill down Tom reaches into his coat pocket for
loose change

---and discovers a SMALL ENVELOPE He opens it to find a
single card with an address

804 W 145th ST
Tom looks over his shoulder Nobody around
Now he’s more sure than ever It’s time to learn the truth
EXT WASHINGTON HEIGHTS BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

creaks open we can see into the parlor where Tom’s FOUR
BROTHERS stand waiting for their newest member to arrive
Tom steps in and the door closes behind him
INT INITIATION ROOM - NIGHT
Dark and candlelit walls lined with ancient tomes
The Brothers stand around Tom with smoking jackets over their
three-piece suits Tom’s coat is gone his shirtsleeves

rolled up to the elbow

Anthony opens a safe removes a wooden box engraved with same
symbol as the book--lightning sword and lamp

Inside there are TWO BLACK OPAL SPHERES

ANTHONY
Hold out your left palm

Tom obeys Nesmith takes the spheres from the box and places
them in Tom’s open hand

NESMITH
Tom your brain is full of things we
call prohibitors Anxieties
dysfunctions those fits of rage
you’re prone to Most importantly
fear This will get rid of all that

Tom instinctively ROTATES THE SPHERES in his hand like
revolving planets They HUM as they circle each other

NESMITH (cont’d)
There are also some parts of you that
have been sleeping ever since you
were born This will wake those parts
of you up

The spheres are moving faster now Tom CLOSES HIS EYES

--and sees MOMENTS FROM HIS PAST

1923 - TOM AS A BOY

A brutal PLAYGROUND BEATING at yet another school Same
fight different battered bully

the wintry backyard of his childhood home smoking REVOLVER
in hand He stares at the blood pooling in snow mesmerized

1944 - TOM AS AN ADULT

In his apartment lost in an uncontrollable RAGE He FLIPS
over a table BREAKS a mirror SMASHES a radio and puts a
powerful FIST THROUGH THE WALL

BACK TO THE INITIATION ROOM
as an ENERGY PULSE courses through Tom’s body and he FALLS

The black spheres roll to the feet of Brother Anthony He
scoops them up and places them carefully back in the box

Tom opens his eyes and RISES His posture is more confident
He even appears more muscular

MCGRADY
Congratulations Brother At last
(hands on his shoulders)

Marshall whips out a starting pistol and FIRES in the air

Tom takes off runningVERY FAST We move with him as he
adjusts to his new speed and within seconds he’s burning it
up like Rickey stealing third

STOPS ON A DIME He looks back at his Brothers and allows
himself a smile This feels INCREDIBLE

grabs his arm

Without them you are nothing

INT COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

A light clicks on to reveal a dank underground cellar dense
with radio communication equipment

Nesmith guides Tom to a table covered with topographic maps
Anthony tunes the hulking SHORT WAVE RADIO to a frequency
playing a light CHOPIN CONCERTO

Marshall sits at a teletype preparing to take dictation
McGrady checks his pocket watch

The Chopin broadcast JANGLES and goes quiet A MALE VOICE
emanates from the speakers It is garbled and muddy--radio of
this time made most men sound alike

reads from a strip of morse code

MARSHALL
Between 820 and 832 AM on the
morning of November 20th a stolen

become clear

they’re about to do and more importantly why

EXT FINANCIAL DISTRICT - BANK OF NORWAY - DAY
A BANK GUARD locks the back of an ARMORED VAN

As he walks around to the driver’s side a MASKED MAN KNOCKS
HIM OUT COLD takes the keys and gets behind the wheel

As another BANK GUARD exits the building a SECOND MASKED MAN
materializes from a nearby alley

BLAM His SHOTGUN tears up the Bank Guard’s abdomen Civilians
scatter as the vehicle SCREECHES AWAY

their haul multiple shelves of HEAVY BURLAP BAGS

MASKED MAN 2
Hoo Looks like goddamn Fort Kno--

They are BLINDSIDED BY A MILK TRUCK and the armored van FLIPS
OVER A FIRE HYDRANT into a DEPARTMENT STORE

Water SPRAYS INTO THE SKY as civilians SCREAM AND RUN Traffic
in this intersection comes to a standstill

Marshall jumps out of the milk truck wearing leather driving
gloves Anthony appears from the subway and applies a sticky
PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE to the back door of the armored van

Nesmith exits a department store and DETONATES THE EXPLOSIVE
by remote The van door BLASTS OFF and SHATTERS the
windshield of a Yellow Cab

A BLACK HEARSE screeches around the corner and SKIDS OUT so
its rear bumper faces the armored van McGrady exits the
Hearse and signals to the others

The four men line up and TRANSFER THE BAGS OF CASH from the
crashed bank van to the Hearse

ON TOM

In position on the northwest corner using binoculars to scan
the long corridors of buildings for police lights

He spots a pair of BLACK AND WHITES 8 blocks out and gives a
sharp two-finger WHISTLE

ON THE HEARSE
McGrady spots the red lights weaving through stopped traffic

MCGRADY
Leave the rest

MARSHALL
That’s a hundred grand

McGrady GRIPS MARSHALL BY THE COLLAR suddenly livid

MCGRADY
You want to die today Brother

Marshall quickly grabs as many bags as he can and tosses them
into the back One of them RIPS OPEN and a stream of loose
bills WHIPS UP IN THE WIND

Anthony crawls beneath the van STICKS AN EXPLOSIVE under the
back tire then rolls under the milk truck and plants another

McGrady WHISTLES to Tom

Tom slides over the hood of a crashed Buick and runs through
the intersection toward the Hearse

His eyes SHIFT toward a figure crawling from the crashed
vanone of the MASKED MEN face bloodied

He’s got a SHOTGUN trained on McGrady

Time SLOWSMcGrady registers the threat too latethis
guy has him coldTom has a split second to act

On pure instinct Tom pulls his Browning pistol and FIRES
TWICE hitting the Masked Man in both shoulders

The man FALLS TO HIS KNEES the life draining from his body
amidst a flurry of falling cash Tom locks eyes with his
cold dead pupils as he falls forward

BLAM Tom looks up to see McGrady with his gun pointed skyward
gazing down at him with a newfound respect

MCGRADY (cont’d)
Time to go Brother

Tom makes a running dive into the open door of the Hearse as
it PEELS OUT away from the scene

INT HEARSE - SAME

Marshall behind the wheel Nesmith removes a remote
detonating device from his pocket

McGrady checks the rearview The COP CARS breach the
intersection without slowing still in pursuit

MCGRADY (cont’d)
Now

CLICK

The armored van and milk truck EXPLODE in a fireball that
FLIPS BOTH VEHICLES in the air They CRASH DOWN ONTO THE
PURSUING POLICE CARS as they roar through the intersection
creating an impassable barricade

The Brothers yell and pump their fists as they speed away
from the crime scene

Tom cannot share their joy He’s DEEPLY DISTURBED by what
just happened and it shows

EXT BRONX SHIPYARD - DAY

The Hearse slows as it approaches several FORD COUPES waiting
alone on a broad expanse of concrete

The men waiting here look like Brotherhood on steroids even
larger and stronger than the ones we know

The back door of the Hearse opens and they go to work
transferring the bags of cash into the waiting Coupes

McGrady approaches the BRUTISH LEADER and gives him a
handshake all their own

BRUTE BROTHER
Youve done a great service McGrady
He will be pleased

MCGRADY
That is all we desire

The Brute Brother spots Tom apart from the others looking
out at the river canals

BRUTE BROTHER
That him

MCGRADY
That’s him

BRUTE BROTHER
You report it to Central

MCGRADY
They brought him to us We’re just
following orders

BRUTE BROTHER

Tom VOMITS into the river wiping away sweat with his tie
McGrady watches him thoughtfully

MCGRADY
I certainly hope so

The trunk of the last Coupe SLAMS The transfer is complete

MARSHALL

POLICE SIRENS in the distance

MCGRADY

INT WASHINGTON HEIGHTS BROWNSTONE - PARLOR - NIGHT

Scotch is poured Cigars are lit Tom sits among his
Brothers now wearing his own burgundy smoking jacket

ANTHONY
(mid-laugh)
-ethen I look over and this poor sap’s
losing his lunch and his dinner

The men CRACK UP and backslap Tom who laughs the same way we
all do when it’s actually not that funny

MARSHALL
How do you feel now that you’ve
drawn blood for our cause

TOM
How should I feel I shot a guy

MARSHALL
He was Obscurum His death brings us
one step closer to victory

We can tell Tom doesn’t completely buy this reasoning
NESMITH
Tom you’ve been holding that glass
for an hour Drink up

There is a hint of suspicion in Nesmith’s voice Tom DRINKS
McGrady takes the floor

MCGRADY
Today we did a great thing Not just
for our Brotherhood But for humanity

BROTHERS
Here Here

MCGRADY
Andwe did it with one more
(all eyes on Tom)
Brother Tom The Father praises you

BROTHERS
Praise to Father Zael

Tom REACTS when he hears that name for the first time What
the hell are these guys talking about

MCGRADY
Now I ask you all is this new
Brother ready to hear The Word
Marshall raises a hand

MARSHALL

MCGRADY
Brother Anthony

Anthony doesn’t hesitate

ANTHONY

too deep to show it

EXT LISPENARD ST - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

Tom and his Brothers walk down this familiar street shiny from
recent rain They stop at the warehouse Tom staked out during the
ticker tape parade

McGrady knocks a complex pattern on the steel door It OPENS
INT EMPTY WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A broad expanse of dusty floor empty and barren They cross
the room to a nondescript door that could be a broom closet

These are STAIRS beyond it and a light below We FOLLOW THEM
DOWN to an underground hallway that opens into

THE GRAND LODGE

A cavernous temple in dark wood Benches make a half circle
before a DIAS featuring a hand-carved BROTHERHOOD SYMBOL
above the proscenium

The hall is packed with more than TWO HUNDRED MEN each
disturbingly similar in matching burgundy smoking jackets
They stare curiously at Tom as he’s led down the carpet
toward the proscenium

They’re welcomed with open arms by the LODGE GRAND MASTER 73
but still hard as shit the way Burt Lancaster was at his
age He wears a long elaborate dark blue robe

GRAND MASTER
Welcome Tom

The Grand Master steps up to the podium and we CRANE OVER HIM
to reveal the 200 BROTHERS now standing at attention

GRAND MASTER (contd)
The time has come for this Brother to
know the Truth Any in this hall with
reason to deny him the Father’s Word
speak now or forever be silent

ON NESMITH
Fighting an instinct deep within But he keeps quiet

GRAND MASTER
So be it

A TALL SLENDER BROTHER brings out a small black box on a
silver tray The Grand Master ceremoniously opens the box and
removes a GLASS PRISM

He hands it to Tom and motions toward an enormous FIRST EDITION
of their book open to a page with only four lines of text

Tom places the prism over the bizarre text Amazingly it is
TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH THROUGH THE GLASS

Tom looks back at McGrady who nods encouragingly

TOM
(reading)
Praise be to Zael Seer of the Day of
Judgment All those who guard against
evil the path to glory is before us
The Father is Truth

Betimes he rises

INT WASHINGTON HEIGHTS BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

cloth to dim the light He’s reading his personal copy of the
book with the prism decoder

We see FLASHES OF TEXT as he reads

servant dutiful and proudand so
the High Emperor called upon him to
build a force of righteousness

Rudimentary drawings of SPACECRAFTA tall ALIEN BEING
suspending a MAN in midair with four-fingered hands

nameto ready for the Change of Times

Tom hears footsteps outside his door Then a light KNOCK
It’s Anthony holding a candle

ANTHONY
I saw your light on

Anthony enters and sits inviting himself in
ANTHONY (cont’d)
I remember when I first learned the
Truth I envy you Brother

TOM
You read this book as a child

ANTHONY
I did And it changed my heart

Anthony senses Tom’s unease

ANTHONY (cont’d)
I know this must be difficult for
you Tom But doubt is the enemy

TOM
A few weeks ago I didn’t know this

believe every word

It says here that an alien race came
to the prophet Zael a thousand years
agowhere have they been since

ANTHONY
Waiting of course

TOM
Waiting for what

ANTHONY
A great day is coming Soon the
Father will return and we will march
to glorious victory in his name

There’s an almost robotic monotone to Anthony’s witness as
if these words have been repeated so often saying them is
easier than breathing

TOM
That’s the truth is it

ANTHONY
The Truth is in His word Know the
Father and you will know yourself
Tom nods like he understands but he doesn’t at all

that someday an evil organization
would enslave the earth

TOM
Obscurum that’s right

EVELYN
And this blacksmith Zael He was
altered by these aliensso his
offspring would grow into a powerful
army to fight this war

TOM
That’s what they believe But I
looked everywhere there’s no proof
this Zael even existed

EVELYN
You don’t have to convince me it
sounds cracked Where do they get
their orders from

TOM
The radio They say it’s a broadcast
from Central Command

EVELYN
Well maybe you can trace the signal
(off his confused look)
I mean if you find the frequency we
can figure out where it’s coming from

TOM
You know how to do that

EVELYN
I know someone who does

TOM
They won’t like me snooping around

EVELYN
Then don’t get caught Here
(writes a number down)
If you’re ever in trouble call this
number and I’1l send help

opportunity to gaze at her perfect skin Beautiful

He throws off the covers to reveal he’s fully dressed
INT COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

The deadbolt CLICKS and the door swings slowly open Tom pulls
TWO HAIRPINS out of the lock and closes the door behind him

He flicks a lighter illuminating the dark

There is a notepad near the short wave radio with a
handwritten DAILY LOG of communications and frequencies
constantly changing He copies down the last five

ON THE MAP TABLE

Tom opens several of the TOPO MAPS broken down into regions
throughout the country two or three states apiece There are
BROTHERHOOD CELLS circled and labeled with ID NUMBERS

One map of the midwest grabs his attention There are
multiple ID Numbers clustered around one location in southern
Ohio Whatever this is there are more Brothers here than
anywhere else

Tom determines the coordinates writes them down and puts the
paper safely in a shirt pocket

Suddenly the radio CRACKLES TO LIFE

Tom follows his instinct get the story He adjusts the
bandwidth tuner and picks up the microphone

TOM
Hello Who is this

A long beat on the other line

An uncomfortable beat of silence Then the line GOES DEAD
Tom hears a phone RING upstairs Oh shit
He scrambles to put everything back where he found it
FOOTSTEPS on the next level up No place to hide He shuts
off his lighter and the room GOES DARK

The door opens to reveal McGrady standing in silhouette
holding a SHOTGUN

Tom stays flat against the wall trying not to breathe

Anthony pops the cap off a bottle of whiskey takes a gulp
and then SPRAYS IT ON TOM’S LEG

Nesmith reaches into the wound with tweezers and removes
something square and silver about the size of a dime

TOM
Go to hell

McGrady raises his pocket copy of Zael’s Word above his head

made to eat fire and so his corrupt
soul shall be taken from this earth

as they move forwardthen he STEPS OFF THE BUILDING

--we fall with him as he PLUNGES FOUR STORIES

--and LANDS ON HIS FEET giving at the knees to absorb the
shock He rises undamaged by a drop that would kill most
people and looks up as a bullet WHIZZES by his head and
SHATTERS a car windshield

The Brothers are FIRING DOWN AT HIM from the roof

Tom RUNS Bullets spray the parked cars behind him filling
each with enough ordnance to spark the gas tank and EXPLODE

corner and disappears into the night

The METRONOME AGENTS in here have jagged short hair and dark
clothes Tom recognizes each of them from his daily life

EVELYN

floating in midair around him

Evelyn removes her trenchcoat to reveal a perfectly toned body
defined in tight black Tom takes a step back shocked

Tom forces open the door and exits onto the deck Manhattan
sprawling out in all directions below him

A familiar rage builds within him like a volcano His fury
explodes and he THROWS HIS FIST THROUGH A WINDOW

Shattered glass falls as his hand SPURTS BLOOD

it over the cut A light scans it Tom pulls his hand away

MAYA (contd)
Do you want me to help or not

He does The light miraculously HEALS HIS WOUND leaving only
a clean pink scar Tom leans against the building exhausted
and overwhelmed

They sit in silence together for a beat

Tom looks out over the sparkling city A PENTHOUSE APARTMENT
lights up on a rooftop below

A MUSTACHED MAN walks onto the deck in a shirt and suspenders
smoking a cigarette The drapes billow and a WOMAN appears in
a long silk robe

She puts her arms around him He doesn’t look at her Instead
he stares out at the city smoking his cigarette

Tom gazes down at this lush life wondering if it could have
been his The man LOOKS UP and makes eye contact

They regard each other curiously for a momentthen the
man’s expression CHANGES His eyes are focused on something

of FULLY AUTOMATIC HANDGUNS from inside his black jacket

Helix opens a HIDDEN COMPARTMENT in the bookshelf and takes
out a FUTURISTIC ASSAULT RIFLE

Maya dives into the long hallway Bullets zip past as she
runs toward the observation deck stairwell

ANTHONY appears blocking her way with a TOMMY GUN She drops
and SLIDES INTO HIS KNEES breaking one standing as he falls
and catching the tommy gun in midair

She spins it around and puts a BURST OF SLUGS in his chest
before he hits the floor Anthony dies mid-blink

Maya steps over the body and continues on without looking down
IN THE DECOY OFFICE

Dante rolls from desk to pillar as TWO BROTHERS fire at him
from behind an overturned file cabinet

Dante throws a paperweight into a picture frame breaking the
glass and distracting the Brothers for a split second--all he
needs He RISES FAST and smokes them both with a pair of
clean shots to the skull

Helix rushes into the next room assault rifle spitting fire
He TAKES A BULLET in the flak jacket knocking him back

MARSHALL appears from the dark and stands over Helix rifle
against his temple execution-style

-then a SHOTGUN BLAST takes a bite out of Marshall’s UPPER
RIGHT TORSO leaving a half-moon sized smoking emptiness
where his arm used to be

Reese steps through the open doorway and cocks the gun again

Marshall looks at his sautered wound bewildered then
collapses to the floor

TOM
You shouldn’t have come here

MCGRADY

TOM
You don’t know what you’re fighting
for It’s all a lie

MCGRADY
Is that what they told you

Suddenly Maya BUSTS DOWN THE DOOR and levels her machine gun
at McGrady He spins on her as Tom draws his Baretta and
these three are locked in a standoff

MAYA
Kill him Tom Break his neck

Tom’s finger twitches on the trigger unable to squeeze it

MAYA

Crane enters to find the wall BLOWN OUT opening a twisted
hole to the thin air above 42nd Street

The door closes slowly behind him and we see NESMITH there
waiting He sneaks up behind Crane and MELEES him with the
butt of his rifle

Crane recovers spins on Nesmith and ATTACKS These two guys
are STRONG They SMASH each other into walls making huge
dents in the plaster--genetically superior man vs naturally
superior man

Nesmith dodges a right hook grabs a pair of brass bookends
off the shelf SMASHES Crane’s head between them like cymbals

Crane reels blood in his eyes Nesmith lunges for the kill
but Crane FLIPS HIM over his shouldersuddenly the Tall Man
is HANGING OFF THE CRUMBLING LEDGE

Crane picks up a folding chair and SWINGS IT INTO NESMITH’S
FACE like a golf club SWATTING HIM OFF THE BUILDING

As Nesmith falls he pulls a cord in his vest and a PARACHUTE
ENVELOPS THE AIR above him He directs it RIGHT ON 42nd

wall his wrath boiling

But if this can happen time is--

GENERAL ANDAX
Unredeemable Not entirely We can’t
erase a tangent once it’s created
but we can repair the damage

The General waves his remote and some of the tangents CHANGE
DIRECTION now travelling parallel to the Original Line

GENERAL ANDAX (cont’d)
Often we succeed Sometimes we don’t

TOM
So this is a tangent

They all grow solemn

GENERAL ANDAX
Yes

TOM
But if it’s not your futurewhy do
you care

GENERAL ANDAX
Some of us don’t

They all look at Helix

HELIX
What It ain’t our problem

GENERAL ANDAX

What Helix fails to recognize is that
these tangents contain living beings
Billions of people like you Since
this conflict began policy has been
driven by a moral obligation to
prevent the sabotage of our shared
destiny for better or worse

Helix scoffs Reese punches his arm

GENERAL ANDAX (contd)
--but this has created a new danger
Due to these new tangents the
continuum has reached critical mass
If Zael succeeds the causality of
this one act could tear the very
fabric of spacetime bringing an end
to the universe as we know it

Andax REVERTS BACK to the Original Line time tangents
sprouting from it like branches on a family tree

GENERAL ANDAX (contd)
The ISA has plugged the holes All we
need is Zael We can foil terror
plots the world over but until we
stop the man he’1ll keep tryingno
matter how many worlds he corrupts

Tom looks through the observation glass at the UNION MARINES
at the Light Gun range laughing and insulting each other

TOM
What can I do

General Andax puts a firm hand on Tom’s shoulder

GENERAL ANDAX
You can help us catch us him Tom

Tom weighs all thisthen gives a confident nod He gets it
General Andax smiles

GENERAL ANDAX (contd)
Good man

GENERAL ANDAX
The Bethany Relay Station is the
broadcast center for the Voice of
America used by the government to
disseminate propaganda during the
war At this time it’s the most
powerful radio tower on the planet

The 3D image changes into a complete VIRTUAL MAP of the
entire structure

GENERAL ANDAX (contd)
This map taken from original
blueprints suggests entire wings of
the complex are unaccounted for

The map flashes LARGE ROOMS that could fit into the
architecture but aren’t there

GENERAL ANDAX (cont’d)
We assume these areas are Brotherhood

We RISE UP above the structure to a satellite photo of a
small town surrounded by farmland

GENERAL ANDAX (contd)
Target is located 10 miles outside
the town of Bethany a main street
serving several hundred residents
Well clear it with a gas leak before
we move Crane will lead the push
all squad leaders report to him

Crane salutes the General

GENERAL ANDAX (contd)
Our sources tell us Zael plans to
stage a coup of the US government on
December 14th That’s up to four
hundred thousand Brothers waiting for
their orders to be broadcast live

HELIX
Can’t we just take out the tower

GENERAL ANDAX
Yes but first we’ll use it to senda
message to Zael’s army to stand down

DANTE
What makes you think they’1ll listen

GENERAL ANDAX
Because they’ll be hearing it from
one of their own

All eyes shift to Tom

An ISA Tech opens a glass box Inside a SMALL INJECTION
DEVICE filled with green liquid

GENERAL ANDAX (contd)
This microspike will allow us to
track Zael wherever he goes--any
plane of time any tangent

(to Tom)

You get this in his system he can
run forever--well be there waiting
Think you can handle it

stretching to the horizon in both directions

He approaches a small CHECKPOINT STATION and two BROTHERHOOD
GUARDS in matching white parkas

This is a restricted area

The bundled figure REMOVES HIS HOOD AND GOGGLES

Tom’s hair is CROPPED CLOSE revealing the RED BIRTHMARK that
continues up the back of his neck to form an ELABORATE

We have ways of extracting
information from the uncooperative
Remember this is war

Yes it is Now take me to him

Nesmith opens his mouth to speak then suddenly looks
elsewhere as if listening to an invisible voice in his ear

SLIDES OPEN revealing a long white corridor

Zael picks up a futuristic LIQUID METAL ENERGY MACHETE and
activates it drawing the fluid metal into a guide until a
jolt of energy HARDENS IT and it glows blue and deadly

ZAEL (contd)

TOM
I’ve been embedded with the ISA I
know the location of their base

Zael POWERS DOWN the blade The metal returns to liquid form
and flows back into the chamber He places it on the rack

ZAEL
Didn’t everyone Your life made my
victory possible Thanks to you we
know the location of the ISA base--
the actual location not the lie you
were about to tell me

Zael’s warm paternal demeanor has evaporated completely now
This is not a good man

ZAEL (contd)
Rest assured the Union Marines
headed here to take out my radio
station will be dead within the hour

A familiar rage boils up within Tomthe same fury he
unleashed on so many schoolyard bullies

ZAEL (contd)
Ohdoes that make you angry Tom
It does Well far be it from me to
rob a man of his revenge

Zael steps within striking distance of the sword in Tom’s
hands and guides it back up toward his neck

ZAEL (contd)
The ISA sent you to kill a terrorist
Do it

Tom holds the blade perfectly still against Zael’s throat He
does not tremble

ZAEL (contd)
Come on you know the smell of blood
and were made to draw it quickly
Cut me

Miraculously Tom represses his anger and LOWERS THE SWORD

Infinite stars and over a prairie of RUNNING WILD DOGS
It FADES OUT as soon as it appears followed by a series of
RANDOM DESTINATIONS that last only a split second like
shuffling through a deck of cards

CALCUTTA INDIA - 1748

A market rich with spices and sensory overload

SHANGHAI CHINA - 1891

Bicycles along the waterfront

MALL OF AMERICA - 2014

Rabid consumers trample each other into a Best Buy at 6AM

ENGLAND - 891 AD

A peasant leads his donkey toward a stone castle
NIMES FRANCE - 1985

A schoolyard full of screaming children

MAURITANIA - 1523

African villagers weave straw baskets in a clay city
NEW YORK CITY - 2135

The darkened stairwell of a shabby TENEMENT APARTMENT

Tom and Maya are JOLTED into this space Maya checks the
readout on her handheld device

MAYA
This is it

A door SLAMS on the floor above Maya draws her sidearm and
climbs the stairs Tom follows close behind weapon up

They approach an APARTMENT DOOR cracked slightly open
A woman SCREAMS inside Maya KICKS DOWN THE DOOR
INT TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Tom and Maya enter an unkempt urban dwelling of the distant
future INDUSTRIAL HARDCORE RAP plays on the radio

MAYA
I know this place

They round a corner to find a WOMAN unconscious on the floor
MAYA (contd)
(realizing)
He was born here

A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT Maya’s left arm EXPLODES BLOOD and she
crumples to the floor

TOM
NO

Tom spins in the direction of the shooter to discover
ZAEL

standing in the living room with a REVOLVER pressed to the
forehead of a SMALL BOY trembling in his arms

The boy’s eyes are recognizable This is ZAEL HIMSELF age 3

ZAEL
You shouldn’t have followed me here

Tom keeps his gun trained on Zael’s forehead Maya remains
motionless on the floor

ZAEL (contd)
One shot A single bullet and my
life’s work ceases to exist A
million lives Your Brothers Their
sons And of courseyou Tom

Tom COCKS his gun

ZAEL (contd)
Don’t The fabric of spacetime is
strong but it’s breakable
(motions to his young self)
I don’t see anyone surviving this
Not even God himself

He may be right For all we know of causality this is the
ultimate suicide bomb

ZAEL (contd)
Put down the gun Tom It’s not worth
it You’1l never--

BLAM BLAM BLAM

Three clean shots in the forehead and Zael DROPS Young Zael
falls to the ground and scrambles away trembling

Tom kneels beside Maya She’s hit bad coughing blood He
takes her in his arms and RISES

Tom turns to face Young Zael now on his feet staring down
at his own twitching corpse The boy does not cry but this
memory will effect him profoundly for the rest of his life

INT APARTMENT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

We TRACK DOWN THE STAIRS with Tom and Maya He carries her
through the building lobby toward the FRONT DOOR

MAYA
(barely conscious)
You have to go backyou’1ll be an
orphan

Tom doesn’t care He KICKS DOWN THE DOOR and carries Maya outside
into a street of the DISTANT FUTURE

EXT BROOKLYN - 2135 - CONTINUOUS

Tom passes the ISA FIRST RESPONDERS dispatched by Crane as
they pour into the building to scrub the crime scene One of
them points across the street to a DOOR OUTLINED WITH LIGHT
It OPENS and we see the silhouette of the ISA MEDICS inside
Maya looks up at Tom eyes full of tears

MAYA
Noyou can’t go home again

TOM
I know

As Tom carries Maya toward the door we BOOM UP to reveal a
BRIGHT VERTICAL FUTURE CITY

White lights packed densely together woven tight with
elevated highways EXPLOSIONS light up the horizon in bursts
quaking the earth

This world is CURRENTLY AT WAR

We PULL BACK through the apartment window into

ZAEL’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM

where METRONOME CLEANERS are hard at work--carrying Zael’s
body on a stretcher wiping the mother’s memory erasing any
sign of conflict

One of them takes the frightened child into a corner and
wraps him in a blanket He wipes specks of blood from the

boy’s face whispering

METRONOME CLEANER
Shhhyou’re safe now

We know that voice The Cleaner takes off his mask and
confirms our suspicion

It’s MCGRADY

Miraculously alive and deep inside an enemy agency A
contingency plan has been activated and it’s working

The traumatized child looks up at his newfound guardian
McGrady’s warm smile calms his nerves

MCGRADY
Everything’s going to be fine

On the boy’s hopeful green eyes we

CUT TO BLACK
