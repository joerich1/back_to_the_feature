President and then got set up with
jobs in the West Wing

MAGGIE
That’s a great chapter title

She writes it down underlines it

( )

MAGGIE
But other presidents have had
affairs FDR JFK

LINDA
This was different Maggie It was
a revolving door Bill Clinton
couldn’t resist women and women
couldn’t resist him I hada
friend at the White House let’s
call her “Brenda” She was almost
fifty but very attractive Very
fit And she had an enormous crush
on POTUS Was always trying to get
his attention

MAGGIE
It all sounds sohigh school-y

LINDA
It was One time I saw her come
out of the Oval Office with her
hair all over the place her
cheeks red She said she and Bill
had kissed and that night she was
going home to tell her husband she
wanted a divorce

MAGGIE
Wow And what happened

Holy shit “Brenda” was Vince
Foster’s wife

culture was There was more than
one suicide

there

LINDA
Working in the West Wingyou’re
at the center of the universe

(MORE)

LINDA (CONTD)
So to be there and see so many
people turn a blind eye to such
unethical indecency to have to
keep so many secrets about what
youre seeing day after day it
was incredibly hard for me

INT REGNERY BOOKS - WAITING ROOM - DAY
LUCIANNE GOLDBERG and Maggie Gallagher approach Linda

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Linda Lucianne Goldberg

LINDA
Hi

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Nice to finally meet you

Lucianne is early 60s an old-school chain-smoking
provocateur The walls of this small publishing house are
covered with pictures of Regnery’s bestsellers mostly
trashy right-wing tell-alls

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
And you two know each other as
that voice on the phone every
night for the last two months

MAGGIE
Hi

LINDA
Hi Maggie

Linda goes for a handshake Maggie goes for a hug They
compromise on a handshake

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
You feel ready

LINDA
So how’s this going to work
exactly Will he make an offer in
the room or-

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Let’s walk Al through the
proposal then let the lawyers
handle any potential offers

( )

LINDA
It’s just that when we first
spoke you mentioned an advance of
fourfive hundred thousand
dollars And I haven’t heard any
mention of money since then

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
In due time I promise

LINDA
This isn’t about money But I am
taking a significant risk with
this - if caught I will lose my
job So I need to know I’m
protected if-

An ASSISTANT peeks her head out

ASSISTANT
Mr Regnery’s ready

INT REGNERY BOOKS - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Linda Lucianne and Maggie sit across from several
senior editors along with

ALFRED REGNERY PRESENT REGNERY PUBLISHING FORMER
REAGAN APPOINTEE

ALFRED REGNERY
This is a brave book Linda
Speaking truth to power isn’t
easy It takes courage

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Linda’s a brave woman

LINDA
Well not that brave I’m using a
pseudonym

Lucianne laughscoughs

ALFRED REGNERY
Now the two women you talk about
in the proposal this “Brenda” and
the flight attendantboth were
assaulted by President Clinton

( )

LINDA

ALFRED REGNERY
No

LINDA
To my knowledge they had sexual
relationships with him but they
weren’t assaulted

MAGGIE
Depending on how you define it
He’s the commander-in-chief Can
they really say no

ALFRED REGNERY
Good point Would you be willing
to name names in the book

LINDA
I don’t think that’s fair to the
women It also makes it very easy
to trace back to me

ALFRED REGNERY
What about Vince Foster You were
the last one to see Vince alive
right

LINDA
Assuming he wasn’t murderedyes

ALFRED REGNERY
Do you think he was murdered

LINDA
I think he was a very decent but
very depressed man who was too
good to work in that White House
And as soon as he died the
people who claim they have nothing
to hide immediately removed
everything they could from his
office

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
In other words if the Clintons
didn’t kill him it was his
friendship with them that drove
him to his death

( )
ll

LINDA
Exactly

ALFRED REGNERY
I love that

LINDA
But this book isn’t about Vince
Frankly he shouldn’t even be in
it It just increases the odds of
them finding out who wrote this

ALFRED REGNERY
I think it’s a mistake to leave
him out

LINDA
No The book is about a White
House that’s more like a frat
house Andand before we go any
further I’d like to talk about an
advance

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Linda-

LINDA
No I think it’s important to talk
about this now My older son still
needs my assistance and my
daughter’s getting ready to apply
to college Lucianne had mentioned
six figure-

ALFRED REGNERY

We will protect you Linda In
terms of advance though it’s
really dependent on the
revelations in the book In order
to get into a six figure number
wed need somethingbigger

Howhow does a White House
intern even get the attention of
the President

MONICA
I flashed my thong

LINDA
You flashed your thong

KEN BACON (0S)
There you are

They turn to see Monica’s boss standing there
KEN BACON
I need you to type up a few
things
Then Ken looks at Linda

KEN BACON
When did you two become so close

INT LINDA’S HOUSE - DAY

Peri’s flipping through a guide to college applications
at a table Linda enters

PERI
What do you think about the
University of Colorado

LINDA
I thought you wanted to go
somewhere close to home

PERI
I was also thinking it might be
nice to get out of the Beltway
you know be surrounded by
mountains and nature They just
started an equestrian team

LINDA
Id rather you be close to home
With your brother in California I
don’t know if I could handle you
being gone too

The phone RINGS Linda goes to get it

LINDA
Hello
INTERCUT MONICA
She’s in her apartment
MONICA

About todayI know I shouldn’t
have told you but I haven’t had
anyone I can confide in other than
my shrink and my mother Which is
really hard because this whole
situation has just been eating
away at me What are you thinking

LINDA
I’m thinking I knew the big creep
had predilections but I’ve never
known him to go after anyone so
young

MONICA

He didn’t go after me It
justhappened

( )

LINDA
Tell me the whole story From
after you flashed your thong

MONICA
Well it started during the
government shutdown last November
Everyone was furloughed so it was
just the top people and a few
interns around And whenever wed
see each other we’d smile and sort
of flirt I knew he wanted me but
I didn’t know if he’d every do
anything about it so one day I
lifted up my dress and flashed him
my thong A few hours later he had
me bring pizza to his office

LINDA
Pizza In the Oval Office

MONICA
It’s not like we ate the pizza

LINDA
What did you do

MONICA
We talked He asked me about
myself and what I wanted to do
And then we kissed And he started
inviting me to his office whenever
he could and we’d talk more and
do more stuff At one point he
called it off because he said he
didn’t think it was right and we
just be friends

LINDA
Yeah I’m sure he wanted to be
really good friends

MONICA
But then it would always start up
again

LINDA

But not sex

( )

MONICA
Never We’d kiss and touch each
other and I’d you know I can’t
believe I’m going to tell you
thisgo down on him

LINDA
That is sex Monica

MONICA
What No Oral isn’t sex Besides
he never even finished He said if
he finished he’d get addicted to
me

LINDA
I have a question why did he have
you transferred out of the White
House when he was getting exactly
what he wanted

MONICA
He didn’t It was Evelyn
Lieberman

LINDA

Did she know what was going on

MONICA
I don’t think so but she was
suspicious She accused me of
being a groupie

LINDA
Evelyn’s close with Hillary it
makes sense

MONICA
Ugh

LINDA
You think Hillary knows She must
know

MONICA
Obviously she knows he’s cheated
in the past but that’s why I
think they try to keep pretty
girls away from the Oval so he
wont do it again

( )

LINDA
I think it’s a political
arrangement She looks the other
way as long as she gets to stay in
power

MONICA
I don’t think it’s an arrangement
I think she’s more like Charlie
Brown trying to kick the football

LINDA
Why do you say that

MONICA
Because if it were an
arrangement then why does he only
call for phone sex when she’s out
of town

LINDA
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU HAVE PHONE
SEX WITH HIM

PERI (0S)
MOM

LINDA
SORRY JUST A SEC

We see Peri in the doorway

PERI
We were in the middle of a
conversation about my future

LINDA
Sorry sweetie just give me one
minute

Peri heads off shaking her head off

LINDA
(back on phone)
Hi I have to go in a minute But
you need to stop taking calls
Don’t let him get whatever he
wants whenever he wants it

MONICA
I’m only keeping in touch so that
he can get me a job back in the
White House after the election
(MORE)

( )

MONICA (CONTD)
I mean I only got kicked out of
there because of him He owes this
to me

EXT PENTAGON - DAY

Linda and Monica drink coffee in a remote picturesque
area outside the Pentagon It’s fall in DC now really
beautiful out

MONICA
It’s so strange to have been in
love with someone and then they
just disappear from your life but
you still can’t escape them
because they’re you know the
president

LINDA
You really think you were in love
with him

MONICA
I think I was Linda

LINDA
I don’t think so You never even
spent time with him outside the
Oval Office You never ate a meal
with him

MONICA
Ugh forget it Why are we always
talking about me Let’s talk about
your love life for once

LINDA
There’s nothing to talk about

MONICA
Well why not

LINDA

I don’t own any thongs to flash
MONICA

Low blow
LINDA

asked me out since my divorce

( )

LINDA (CONTD)

okay with that

years

fundraiser tonight

young guy chanting “four more beers”

INT LINDA’S OFFICE - DAY

Monica lounges on the couch in Linda’s office She looks
completely dejected

MONICA
Two months since the election and
not one returned email or phone
call or letter NOTHING Linda
I’m beginning to think he never
planned on bringing me back to the
White House

Linda pulls out the latest copy of Newsweek The cover
story is “SHOULD SHE BE HEARD CLINTON V JONES GOES TO
THE SUPREME COURT” Accompanied by a picture of Paula
Corbin Jones

LINDA
This is probably why he’s avoiding
you He can’t get caught with his
pants down when he’s being sued
for-

MONICA
-having his pants down

They both laugh Then Monica starts to cry surprising
Linda

LINDA
Oh come on

( )

MONICA
I’m sorry I just thought
everything was going to work out
I really did But I can’t make
these feelings I have go away

Crying turns to sobbing Linda isn’t sure what to do She
reluctantly consoles her As Monica cries on her
shoulder

Cliff Bernath passes by does a double take

MONICA
What am I going to do Linda
Should I just leave Washington

LINDA
Do not leave just because of him
You do realize what kind of person
he is right Look at this Paula
Jones lawsuit

MONICA
You don’t think he actually did
that do you

LINDA
I don’t know

MONICA
Linda Come on That he took his
penis out and said ‘kiss it’ That
sounds so fake

LINDA
So you don’t think he had a state
trooper bring Paula Jones up to
his hotel room for sex

MONICA
Oh I think he probably did that I
just don’t think he whipped it out
and said ‘kiss it’

LINDA
This is so depressing
MONICA
I just need some way to get his

attention

KATHLEEN
I’m not lying Why are you lying

LINDA

and you stuck around because you
liked him I remember the day you
say this happened You
werehappyjoyful

Thank you for meeting me

Well you wouldn’t stop calling

ISIKOFF

It’s looking more and more likely
that Kathleen Willey will be
subpoenaed in the Paula Jones
case And you’re the only witness
to this he saidshe said My
editors are extremely reluctant to
write about this but once the
Drudge story went live we really
had no choice

Linda takes a long beat before deciding what to say

LINDA
The reason Kathleen can’t be a
corroborating witness in the Paula
Jones case is she wasn’t
assaulted

ISIKOFF
How can you be sure

LINDA
I remember it very clearly I even
wrote it down for a book proposal
that I later scrapped if you want
proof I saw her come out of the
Oval Office the day in question
She was flustered happy and
joyful Her face was red and her
lipstick was off

MONICA
You won’t believe what I just
found out from Betty Not only did
the creep buy me the T-shirt I
wanted from Martha’s Vineyard he
got me a hat and a dress Even
though he’s a big schmuck he’s

surprisingly sweet

INT LINDA’S HOUSE

Linda’s really tired of this pattern playing out over and
over mimes hanging herself with the phone chord as she

listens to Monica

INT PENTAGON - LINDA’S OFFICE - DAY

Linda pulls out a card from her Rolodex that’s labeled
simply “New York” Picks up the phone and dials

LINDA
Hi It’sit’s Joan Dean Please
don’t hang up I know things
didn’t end well between us but
II’m in a very difficult
position right now professionally
and morally and you’re always
plugged in to what’s going on I
was hoping you’d be willing to
talk to me about my options

INTERCUT LUCIANNE GOLDBERG

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Go on

LINDA
Kathleen Willey who you might
remember as “Brenda” from my book
is going to be giving a deposition
in the Paula Jones case and I’m
probably going to be close behind

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
I wondered if Brenda was Kathleen

( )

LINDA
I’m not going to lie under oath
Not to protect Kathleen certainly
not to protect Bill Clinton and
not to protect any others who may
be involved

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
What does that mean

LINDA
Can I trust you with a secret
that’s been eating away at me

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
You can trust me Linda

Lucianne reaches for a tape recorder attached to her

phone turns it on Linda takes a deep breath

LINDA
I’ve become friends with a young
woman who has been having an on-
and-off affair with Bill Clinton
who she refers to as the big
creep She was twenty one and an
intern when it started

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Wow

LINDA
They have phone sex They exchange
gifts I keep thinking it’s all
going to be over but every time
it starts back up again She’s not
shy about talking about it - I
mean she calls me every night and
just talks and talks - and I have
this feeling it will come up if
I’m deposed Even if it doesn’t -
even if I just have to talk about
Kathleen - it’s highly likely I’11l
lose my position at the Pentagon
I need a way out And I’d like it
to be a way that exposes this
president for what he really is

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Linda my tabloid heart is beating
fast Let’s get the book going
again

(MORE)

( )

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG (CONT
Or even better get this girl on
the talk shows We can get a huge
payday

LINDA
She wants nothing to do with this
She’s in love But I am interested
in getting the book going again to
protect myself financially I
wouldn’t use her real name of
course

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Okay Okay What we need to do is
plant the seeds of this story
whet the public’s appetite

LINDA
How

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
We pick a journalist Someone
close to the story Someone with a
platform

LINDA
Mike Isikoff

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Perfect But we need to make clear
this is a real verifiable story
not some right-wing rumor-mill
You said this girl - this intern -
calls you every night

LINDA
Yeah

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
What I want you to do is go down
to Radio Shack grab a voice-
activated recorder and tape every
word she says to you When we have
enough we play it for Isikoff
That way if you get deposed and
tell the truth you can never be
accused of lying Not by the
President’s lawyers not by
anyone

LINDA
Is thatis that legal

D)

( )

LUCIANNE GOLDBERG
Yeah Of course it’s legal
EXT RADIO SHACK - PARKING LOT

cigar in her pussy Now they’re
broken up but she’s still obsessed

her get a job Just listen-

Lucianne leans in presses play Isikoff stops the
recorder

ISIKOFF
This doesn’t feel right I mean
if you can prove that the White
House is getting this girl a job

meeting the Ambassador to the
United Nations on the 31st

ISIKOFF
How does that help

I don’t know How many people have
you told

About the hat pin Just you

LINDA
Well someone else must have known

MONICA
They question you about me under
oath you’ll lie right

LINDA
If I have to testify if Im
forced to answer questions and I
answer truthfully its going to
be the opposite of what you say
so therefore its a conflict
right there

MONICA
But it doesnt have to be a
conflict Just say you don’t know
anything

( )

LINDA
How If they say Has Monica
Lewinsky ever said to you that she
is in love with the President or
is having a physical relationship
with the President - if I say
no that is fucking perjury

MONICA
I know

LINDA
But no you really dont know
cause you dont believe me I
think you think this is very easy
and I should just say fuck you
they cant prove it

MONICA
I believe you but obviously I
dont have the same feelings about
the situation that you do so I
cant-

LINDA
What do you mean

This is how - this is how family
is I would lie on the stand for
my family That is how I was
raised as family We lied We lied

PAUL ROSENZWEIG
Short

JEROME MARCUS
Hey so the reason we wanted to
have dinner-

RICHARD PORTER
-other than to see your beautiful
face-

JEROME MARCUS
-is that we have something kind of
crazy for you There’s a witness
in the Paula Jones case who’s been
making tapes of an intern who’s
having a sexual relationship with
Bill Clinton

PAUL ROSENZWEIG
I JUST saw him on the beach with
his wife looking completely in
love

Definitely staged

Anyway now Vernon Jordan is
helping her get a job presumably
in exchange for her silence

PAUL ROSENZWEIG
My god You’ve heard these tapes

JEROME MARCUS
No but other people have

RICHARD PORTER
They were illegally made so she’s
keeping them close to the vest for
the moment

Who’s the woman making them

RICHARD PORTER
Career civil servant Just this
real gossip-y kind of batty mom
who lives out in Maryland and
works in the Pentagon

JEROME MARCUS
Her name’s Linda Tripp

RICHARD PORTER
And get this she used to be Vince
Foster’s secretary

JEROME MARCUS
And she was friends with Kathleen
Willey when she lip-locked with
Clinton

RICHARD PORTER
And it’s not just a sex story
Clinton’s going to have to
testify and he doesn’t know about
the tapes Has no idea he’s about
to perjure himself under oath If
this Vernon Jordan story is true
I’m pretty sure he obstructed
justice as well

be within the scope of the
