INT GIRL‘S BATHROOM - DAY

Shavonne Jodi and Kaye are hanging out in the bathroom Kaye
and Jodi share a cigarette while Shavonne primps in the mirror

SHAVONNE
Yeah he acts all cocky now but
did you notice when he poked his
head in the room a lictle while
ago he didn‘c even look at me
(a beac)
Forgec him

JORDI
Ts Randy Floyd going out with
anyone right now

SHAVONNE
I don’t think so I don’t know about
that guy Watch him in action -
hes like a polititian

JoDrI
Just because a guy isn’t like the
Neanderthals you like I mean you
basically dont like any guy whose
IQ approaches triple digits

Before Shavonne can respond Kaye jumps in

KAYE
You know this is really pathetic
All you ever talk about is guys
Everything is always guys - going
to watch guys do whatever it is
theyre doing at the time getting
all dressed up so maybe some guy
will notice you Do you chink
guys spend one-tenth the time we do
thinking and catering to us Hell
no Theyre too busy DOING things
besides preparation for us t
do we DO Sit around and plot
about them in some way or another

SHAVONNE

Yeah bue look at the shit they do
playing sports fixing up their
ears It’s all bullshic anyway
who can take it serious

Co 10
t 6

JODI
We don’t have any choice BUT to
take whatever they do serious

KAYE
Exactly
(to Shavonne)
And there you were in class with
them trying cto list all the
Gilligans Island episodes withou
even a HINT of irony ”

SHAVONNE
What the hell are you talking
about girl

KAYE
You never thought about that show
Its what‘s called a male
pornographic fantasy Think about
it Youre basically alone on an
island with two readily available
women one a seductive sex-
goddess type the other a healthy
o girl-next-door type with a nice
“ butt So guys have it all - the
Madonna and the whore and what do
women get Nothing A geek an
over-weight middle age guy a nerdy
scientific type chose are all
types that your typical male feels
least threatened by So in the
male viewers mind he puts himself
on the island and he can have it
1 all A woman puts herself on the
island and shes bored shitless

SHAVONNE

Youre really full of it First
off you forgot Mr and Mrs
Howell and second the audience is
probably half women anyway

KAYE
My point exactly Women are taught
i to not mind being bored as long as

they are occasionally acknowledged

(thinking)
And being stranded on an island
awaiting rescue is a TOTAL metaphor
for the position in which most
women are put in in this society

‘aa today

Jodi walks over to Kaye

— —

la

6 JODI
You know ever since you spent
spring break with your sister at
college youve had this fucking

Hirsh makes it to the car and they speed off Unfortunately as

EXT JUNIOR HIGH - DAY

In contrast the senior girls seem much more organized and
orderly as they load up three trucks with nervous and giggling
freshman girls Before getting in the seniors put pacifiers in
their mouths With the trucks almose full Jodi happens to
notice Sabrina standing nearby

JODI
Who are you

SABRINA
(looks around)
Uh nobody I mean I wasne on

JoDr

Sabrina looks a little hesitant at first but soon gets in the
back of one of the trucks Jodi gives her a pacifier while
Freshman Girls 1 and 4 look a little miffed that Sabrina made
the cut somehow

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

In hot pursuit the carload of seniors are right behind Penticos
car honking and waving their boards in the air

The nervous freshmen sit in Pentico’s car like caged animals
Pentico a those ass-wipes
PENTICO

He cakes a quick turn that the seniors miss Sut instead of

backing up or Curning around Hudson trenches through the yard cf
a corner Lot and is soon right behind Pentico’s car again

EXT CARLS HOUSE - DAY

When Carl jumps out near his house O‘Bannion is out of the car

standing between Carl and his front door paddle in hand

OQ’ BANNION

just slowly backs away wich his hands up in the air a Little

O’ BANNION
(extreme sarcasm)
Serry ma’am Just making sure

Carl Ill be seeing you around

He smiles at Carl like Im going to kill you when I get the
chance and walks off

EXT DAIRY QUEEN PARKING LOT - DAY

The freshman girls are in a circle with the senior girls walking

around them The attitude of the senior girls varies from fun-
loving to sadistic Darla seems to have assumed the role of
tyrannical drill instructor

DARLA
You disgusting litele freshmen
sluts AIR-RAID
The freshmen girls are on their stomachs immediately
DARLA
That was pitiful On your feet
you lazy little bitches
As soon as they are all up she yells again

Air-raid
They drop again
DARLA
How did you punks ever make it out
of junior high
(more

DARLA (Coned)
The future of our high school is
doomed with losers like you no-
counts coming in Now lets try it
one more time

Most dont know exactly what she wants and donc get up very
quickly

DARLA
That means GET UP you worthless
little bitches

They all get up immediately

DARLA
‘ Air-raid

They all are on the pavement quicker than ever

DARLA
Well we tried we gave you a
chance But because you little
prick teases cant quite follow
instructions were going to have
to try something else

She signals to several of the others who bring over ‘the
supplies” Soon they are dumping rounds of flour syrup ketchup
and vegetable oil all over them Occasionally one will crack an
egg over someone’s head Meanwhile in the crowd of amused
onlookers Tony and Mike analyze the proceedings as they sip
slushes

TONY
Whats fascinating is the way
not only the school but the entire
community supports all this or at
least turns their heads I mean
they apparently have permission to
use this parking lot no parents
seem to mind

MIKE
And actually the freshmen girls
are even made to feel privileged to
be participating

TONY
As are the freshmen guys who the
seniors want to bust the most
Its the ultimate stamp of
approval

Back in the pack of girls the seniors have now paired off with
the girls and are humiliating them individually Shavonne walks
Freshman Girl 1 over to Pink who’s standing there with Don and
some Of the others

FRESHMAN GIRL 1

PINK

While Freshman Girl 4 is pushing an egg across the parking lot
with her nose Darla is giving Freshman Girl 3 a hard time She
pokes her in the breasts

DARLA

A bit confused she looks at Darla’s rather flat chest

FRESHMAN GIRL 3

27

DARLA
Air-raid smartass
She does
DARLA
Get up

When she does Darla pokes her again even harder

DARLA
Theyre still here Keep air-

She hits the pavement again while a little farther away a small
group of freshmen are made to sing “Flaming Mamie to the crowd

FRESHMEN CHORUS

in town

DARLA
Now sing “Seniors”

He gives them each a major whack

HUDSON
Air-raid

Benny‘s board

in 28 EXT DAIRY QUEEN PARKING LOT - DAY

Back at the parking lot Tony and Mike continue to contemplate
i all thats going on around them enjoying it at the same time

TONY
0 believe its because we dont
have a significant rival high
om school within 30 miles of us
more

TONY (Contd)
You know most schools have a cross-
town rival or the next town over is
the mutually agreed upon “evil
other in which one can projece all
hostility and blame

MIKE
So its like weve declared war
on ourselves feeding off our
own

TONY

Exactly - under the guise of an
initiation ritual

Just chen Jodi brings Sabrina over to propose to Tony

° P Sabrina
shyly gets down on her knees in fronct of him

SABRINA
Will you marry me

Tony seems a little awkward at firse but soon gets in the swing
of the game
TONY
(to Mike)
What am I supposed to say here
(mocking himself)
So uhhh whatll ya give me

SABRINA
Anything you want
TONY
Define anything
SABRINA
Whatever you want

wandered off Tony gestures for her to stand up

MIKE

Back to the pit kid

Sabrina glances back ac Tony as shes being marched away Tony
kind of waves bye to her and she sort of waves back in a shy but
“slightly teasing manner

MIKE
Am I mistaken or did you just catch
a bit of a rap with that young
thing
(sarcastic)
You stud

TONY
mock cocky)
Well you know how it is

MIKE
I bec shes pretty cute once you
clean all that shit off her

(realizing)

Its finally happening were
seniors ey‘li now be all kinds
of younger girls who think we‘re
cool just by virtue of our age and
senior status

TONY

I guess it’s some sort of a
compensation for all these tortuous
years of neglect You have to
admit despite our accomplishments
in other areas we don’t have a
whole lot to show for ourselves in
the female category

Mike sees an opportunity to build his case for them going out
later that night

28 MIKE

Yeah and its pretty tough wnen you
hever want to put yourself in a
position of MAYBE something
happening MAYBE 1£ we lefsc che
poker table one weekend night and
did something else MAYBE something
would have the opportunity of
happening And then you might jusc
experience something a little more
Sangible than an Abraham Lincoln

ream

TONY
And MAYBE if you wouldnt set the
dialectic up in such simple and
confrontational terms just MAYBE
I could do it and not feel bullied
into it You could use a Thomas
Jefferson dream

29 EXT DAIRY QUEEN PARKING LOT - DAY

On the other side of the parking lot O’Bannion comes walking

INT PICKFORDS HOUSE - DAY

Pink lets himsel£ in and walks down the hall He comes o
Pickfords door and knocks The door cracks a bit and we see
Pickfords paranoid glance Seeing Pink he opens che door
They do one of their patented slow cool handshakes as he enters
his room of rock star posters centerfolds and surrealistic
prints Michelle sits in a bean-bag chair with headphones on

PICKFORD
Piiink

PINK
My man

Pickford goes back over to the door and locks it by sticking an
ice pick in a hole-in the frame that acts like a dead-bolt He
then goes over to his bottom drawer and removes it completely

In the space below the bottom drawer he pulls out his stash He
grabs a pre-rolled joint off his Frisbee tray and lights it up
after he hands Pink a full bag

PICKFORD
A sample of the goods

PINK
Cool

He takes a hit and passes it back

PICKFORD
Fifteen bucks

As Pink hands over some cash theres a sudden knock at the door
He panics quickly handing the joint back to Pickford who tries
to remain calm as he quietly but quickly starts putting
everything away

PICKFORD
Who is it
PICKFORD‘S MOM (0S

ere

PICKFORD
What is it

PICKFORDS MCM 0S)

spray of some air freshener Then theres a loud knock at the
door and his fathers voice rings our

PICKFORDS DAD (0S)

Pickford pulls out che ice pick lock and opens the door At the
last minute Pink remembers he has a bag of pot in his hand and
stuffs it down the front of his pants

PICKFORD
Whos out there

PICKFORD’S DAD a rather large man semi-fashionably dressed in a
leisure suit type outfit steps into the room

PICKFORD’S DAD
Did you order some kegs of beer

Suppressing a panic Pickford walks over to his window and looks
out

EXT PICKFORDS HOUSE - DAY

We see Pickford’s POV out the window There is a guy
unloading kegs from his liquor truck

PICKFORD

The delivery guy looks at che paperwork

his eyes to his parents

INT TONY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The guys are in the middle of a hand but as usual are more
focused on their conversation than on winning another quarter

MIKE —
Im just saying once youre
labeled that’s it

43

MIKE ‘Conetd)
digh school kids don’t seem cto be
able co comprehend multifaceted
personalities

TONY
Sounds like sour grapes to me

ROYCE
(to Mike)
So how have you been labeled
(to Tony)
Who‘s play is it

MIKE
Tonys

ROYCE
Then go already

Tony pulls out a pocket calculator and punches in some numbers

before deciding to throw in a couple of chips while Mike
continues

MIKE
You know just like Tony the
slightly wimpy slightly nerdy
type Women are the worst when it
comes to that Ask any high school
girl what qualities she looks for
in a guy and she‘ll say “oh that
he’s intelligent sensitive has a
good sense of humor” But that
next day that same gizl will be
walking down the hall getting felt-
up by 2ome brain-dead gorilla
linebacker

Mike folds

TONY

‘The only way to compete is to start
a rumor youre hung like a horse or
something

After Royce tosses in a few chips Tony reveals his winning hand
and scoops up the pot

MIKE
What am I even still doing here

TONY
(to Mike)
What did Cynthia say when you
talked to her earlier

43 MIKE
Shes going to come by here and
were going to go by that parry
You guys can stay here all nignz
play cards and then go home and
yank it as always

TONY
For the record I never said was
opposed to going out anywhere

ROYCE
Me either

MIKE
Well chen good - it’s decided

Royce starts dealing the next hand

ROYCE
Five card drool
(to Mike)
Your brief derogatory allusion to
mascurbation made me remember a
thought I had the other day in
reference to that subjecc

Tony and Mike lower their cards and look around at each other
like ‘this should be interesting

ROYCE
Isn‘t it funny how everybody does
it but if someone happens to catch
you

Mike and Tony exchange glances as if Royce speaks from personal
experience

ROYCE
(continuing)

-you get treated like some kind
of Sicko

TONY
But it’s like practice for the real
world The same principle is at
work in politics

MIKE
Politics is the real world

“44
b-
—

TONY
(continuing)
For example all che scuff
Kennedy did was okay because he
didn‘c get caught but Tricky-Dick
got nabbed and they made him pay

but chen you show up out of nowhere
like a little lost puppy dog

He positions himself behind and to the side of Carl and gets
ready to give him his first lick

O’ BANNION
I‘d like to dedicate this first
lick to your mother fucker

Just as he’s drawing back his board at the height of his
sadistic glee O’Bannion catches a solid drop of paint on his
arm He holds his swing in mid-arc dumbfounded As he stares
at the drop he gets another drop on che head Confused but
curious he looks upward just in time to see the source of his
stunning and thorough drenching in white paint and other junk
from above In the confusion and O’Bannion’s general
helplessness Carl sprints to Pentico’s waiting car that has
pulled up He jumps in and they peel out

Physically humiliated and embarrassed he walks over to his car
On the way he suddenly smashes his board against the street
cracking it into many pieces He throws the piece that is lefe
in his hand as far as he can and leaves the rest on che ground
He gets in his car and speeds off Only then do the others look
at each other and howl with laughter

MIKE
i‘ve got it all planned our Most
fights at places like this never
get past a punch or two before it’s
broken up right Theres this
almost natural instinct to noc
upset the herd too much So
just have to be sure to get one
good punch in and then play

defense
CYNTHIA
Why are you even thinking like
this
MIKE

Ac first you‘re relieved to get
away from the situation but now
there’s a level of humiliation
setting in that I can tell is going
to be with me a long time This
could be yet another experience
that contributes to me being a
litcle ineffectual nothing the reset
of-my life I have the conscious
ability to rebel against thac If
nothing else it’ll set an example
and a tone for my senior year

Ic‘s like when you go into prison
They say walk right up to the
baddest dude in the whole place and
punch him right in the nose in
front of everyone He might beat
the crap out of you but nobody
will ever fuck with you because who
wants to get punched in the face
even one time You gotta prove
youre one of those whos not
afraid to

with a loud pop

misery

EXT NEAR CARS - NIGET

Cynthia and Mike are back near Tony and Sabrina leaning against
a car and talking

MIKE
Z just think it’s important to
rebel against all those petty fears
like pain or even death

MIKE icontd)
I€é you can gec to thac pointe where
you are not only noc afraid of
death but perhaps even embracing
it then there is no longer any
bad Everything then goes beyond
judgement - goodevil rightwrong -
ic’s all bullshic

CYNTHIA
From your perspective maybe but
certainly youre not implying thac
this is valid thinking for
everyone

MIKE
‘ I‘m not everyone and of course my
perspective - for better and worse
it’s the only one I’ve got

CYNTHIA
So if there is no absolute
morality judgement or anything
else would you push the button
that would start a global thermo-
nuclear war if you could

MIKE
Im not sure depends on my mood at
the cime

They all laugh a little Cynthia rolls her eyes

CYNTHIA
Great

Although Tony seems to have been paying more attention to
Sabrina he finally jumps in the conversation

TONY
Let’s just say were thankful the
button to the nuclear holocaust is
in the hands of policicians worried
about re-election and not someone
like you going through an
existential crisis

Mike gets a lictcle antsy and begins to walk away

They look across the way to see Don walking away from Shavonne as
she follows He then stops and twists his way into her arms
momentarily before they break and walk farther into che woods

j JODI

Do you ever just see people and

think of us as simply products of
lust and sex At the moment of

thing from our parent’s mind
KAYE

generation are mistakes anyway

He looks at Julie and then past her where he catches eyes with
Sabrina who’s in mid-flirty conversation with Tony They
experience a big moment of recognition and smile and shrug at
each other ag if to say ‘this is the life but this is crazy’

EXT NEAR PARKED CARS - NIGHT
Tony and Sabrina continue talking

TONY
Isnt it someone’s theory that
our entire personalities are formed

Jodi and Kaye walk by them on their way down the road
JODI
(smiling)
Hey guys

Jopr
Okay cool

SABRINA
Bye
(ta Tony

Yeah I know what youre talking

about Certain things stick with
you forever Like when I was in

second grade in order to get words

right on a spelling test we used

to make up sentences where the

first letter in each word stands

for a letter Like arithmetic was

“A rat in the house mighc eat the

ice cream and geography was

“George eats old gray rats and

paints houses yellow’

Tony laughs

SABRINA
Ill probably be seventy years old
and when I go to write one of those
words one of those stupid
sentences will still go through my
head every single time

They both laugh a bit Darla suddenly walks up to Sabrina and
Tony
DARLA
(co Sabrina)
Air-raid
They both seem kind of surprised and Sabrina looks up at Tony
DARLA
even meaner)
I said air-raid freshman

Tension mounts considerably and Tony feels a little confronted

TONY
What for Cmon

DARLA

This is between me and her and she
better be on that ground in five
seconds

Everybody just kind of stands there

TONY
She doesnt have to because shes
with me

OARLA
(to Sabrina)
Air-raid or its your ass

TONY
(to Sabrina)
Dont do it

Sabrina still says nothing but looks at both of them sort of
weighing the aggressor against che protector A lictle unsure of
what to do she still doesnt air-raid

DARLA
Thats it you little freshman
bitch Im never going to forget
this Im going to make the next
year of your life hell

Darla storms off while Sabrina and Tony just kind of look at each
other like what was that Mike walks over cto them

MIKE

Yeah don’t air-raid for that

bitch I hate shit like that
It’s like that Clint fucker in
front of all his friends

He does a re-enactment by pushing Tony

MIKE

(continuing)

(pushes again)
Huh motherfucker

TONY
Okay okay

Mike suddenly sees Clint raising hell in the keg line As if led
by some wild instinct he starts to walk over to him

MIKE
The dominant male monkey will get
his comeuppance

Clints back is to Mike when he walxs up to him He ett
beer in his hand and kind of glances around with a signee a see
quizzical look on his face He soon focuses on Clint and pours
his ermire beer over Clint’s head As a stunned Clint whiris
around Mike quickly drops the empry cup and punches Clint a
fairly good one in the face Unfortunately for Mike Clint
recovers rather quickly grabs Mike’s shirt with one hand and
starts punching him with che other

Pink and Benny see the commotion and almost instinctively run
over to the fight

EXT FIGHT SCENE - NIGHT

As Tony Pink and Benny arrive to try to help break ic up they
are shielded from the fight by a large wall of people circled
around the nucleus of the fight Contradictory to Mike’s plan
no one in the immediate vicinity seems to want to break up the
fight Worse still by being such eager spectators they are
actively shielding out those who want co help Mike

PINK
Move 1t

Pink Benny and Tony (by following their lead) aggressively push
their way through the crowd Finally as Mike continues to get
the holy shit beat out of him the guys break through and pull
Clint off Mike

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Jedi and Kaye are walking through the woods smoking a joint when
they come across an old cemetery They walk through it looking

at headstones In the distance we HEAR cars and trucks starting
up and leaving the beer bust sight

thoughts Jodi senses this and says nothing Kaye suddenly
turns and starts walking out of the cemetery
