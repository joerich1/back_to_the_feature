Hey Sally

Chad Denby Master of Ceremonies comes into

DENBY
The big star of Chad Denbys big seagoing show Well

Sally is looking around rather nervously

SALLY
Well thats something--even if only the fish can see it

DENBY
Are you happy

SALLY
Will be--as soon as the ship sails

NED
I thought I had our sailing covered up--
(indicates paper)

--and here it is

SALLY

Do you think Lother could have seen it

DENBY
Youd better get on board Ill take care of the trunks
Hey porter

Sally moves near gangplank near which is standing

a gang of five or six vaudevillians of various types
etc etc Suddenly they see Sally and rush forward
with enthusiastic greetings

of the boys and girls to come down and give you a cheer

General ad-lib as they give Sally flowers wish her
luck etc Sally is ill at ease--she ad-libs with the
others

FIRST VAUDEVILLIAN
Say these steamship companies are going into the show
business in a big way

SECOND VAUDEVILLIAN
I should say so--this transatlantic showboat idea is a
novelty

THIRD VAUDEVILLIAN
I think its a conspiracy--They want to take all the
vaudeville acts out to the middle of the Atlantic and
dump them overboard

FOURTH VAUDEVILLIAN
Ha Ha Thats a dirty trick to play on the fish

FIFTH VAUDEVILLIAN
Do they pay any kind of money on these big ships

Scotchman says to the window--Gee youre tight--
and the window says--You loosen up a bit and so will

I--Good--And then I do the one--

from Ned)

Oh--you dont like it eh

NED
Chad--Lothers on the boat and Im worried sick about
Sally--

DENBY

NED
No--but Im going to keep my eye on--

The door opens--Sally enters

SALLY
(gaily)
Am I a member of this club

DENBY
(forcing a laugh)
Youre the President Come in Your brother was just
telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--

SALLY

Are you paying any attention to his jokes--the first
thing you know youll be taking piano lessons from
Venus de Milo--

(then to Ned)
Get out of here

(She pushes him good-naturedly

and he leaves)

DENBY
Everything OK

SALLY
Just what the doctor ordered

She glances around the large cabin which has been
turned into an office for the Master of Ceremonies
It contains the usual paraphernalia including
stacks of music orchestrations a few theatrical
photographs a violin in a case a portable mike
etc

SALLY
(looking around)
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street

DENBY
Like it

SALLY
Swell--Youve got Times Square right here--all but the
noises--

DENBY
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see Sally I
sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company

SALLY
And youve put it over--havent you

DENBY
Why not I give em a great show--and you know--
Were doing capacity Sally--and all Nice people--

SALLY
(admiringly)
You never fail at anything do you Chad

DENBY
No--not much--excepting--
(looks at her steadily)

SALLY
(glances at her picture on wall
Still got my picture I see--I was pretty dumb then
wasnt I Chad

DENBY
No--Inexperienced--
(looks at picture)
A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was
Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet

SALLY
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to
do this--

DENBY
Do what--

SALLY
(places her hand on his arm
affectionately)
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours
notice--you never asked why but I guess you know

DENBY
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away
from a rat--

SALLY
It wasnt only that--Ned was in a jam

DENBY
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that too

SALLY

(nodding)
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was
OK by me

(She avoids his eye)
I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock
promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked
It didnt seem to matter--I didnt care--

(her voice lowers)
--until he roped Ned in Some confidence game--and the
kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass

DENBY
I felt pretty low Sally when I heard you were running
around with a racketeer--

SALLY
(With a wan smile)
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks When I
found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee
wouldnt stand for it and--well--here I am

DENBY
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of
months--youll soon forget all about it

SALLY
Chad Denby broadcasting--
(She kisses him lightly on the
cheek)
--the nicest man I ever knew--

DENBY
But not nice enough to marry--eh

SALLY
(coaxingly)
Come on now--youve forgotten all about that

DENBY
Ill never love anybody else

Sally looks at him a moment before speaking--her
eyes are moist
